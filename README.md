# langwitch-deno

run:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langwitch-tools/langwitch-deno/main/run.sh | bash
```

but actually look at the script first because it's a bad idea to get into the habit of doing this too often. i'm including it for convenience but i really don't recommend it.
