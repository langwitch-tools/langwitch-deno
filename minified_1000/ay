But he was a little disappointed about it.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa, mä jukʼa llakitaw jikxatasïna.

Do what you can do.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk luram.

He would be very useful.	Jupajj wali askïspawa.
It was necessary to do so.	Ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
He didn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
He doesn't know any better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkiti.

But there isn't much time for that.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw walja tiempox utjkiti.
Now he could see it clearly.	Jichhajj uk sum uñjäna.
No one has anything.	Janiw khitis kunas utjkiti.

I said no, again.	Nayax janiw sasaw sista, wasitat.
This one is going bigger and better.	Akax juk’amp jach’a ukat juk’amp sumaw saraski.
He doesn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskiti.
It was staring at him like a beautiful figure.	Ukajj mä suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
But tonight he looked sad.	Ukampis jichha arumax llakitaw uñnaqäna.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utan utjkänti.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But that is still important.	Ukampis ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He really knew the game.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka anattʼañ yatïna.
It’s not the first time he’s done this.	Janiw nayrïr kuti ukham lurkiti.

Therefore, he did so.	Ukatwa ukham luräna.
He was really alone now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax sapakiw jikxatasïna.

He was discovered yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jikxatasïna.

No.	Janiwa.
He knows what he is doing.	Jupajj kunsa luri uk sum yati.
You can do things yourself.	Juma pachpaw kunsa lurasma.
It’s really not worth it.	Chiqpachansa janiw askïkiti.
But it needs something.	Ukampis ukatakix kuns munasispa.
I thought you felt the same way.	Nayajj jumajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.
Let’s take a look at that.	Uka toqet uñjañäni.
Anything better or my feelings.	Kunas juk’amp askiwa jan ukax nayax kunjams jikxatasi.
This is very important.	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa.

But there is nothing wrong with that.	Ukampis janiw kunas jan walïkiti.
He was doing well.	Jupajj sumwa luraskäna.
That is not a problem at all.	Ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Too far, he thought.	Sinti jaya, sasaw amuyäna.

It worked just as well.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw irnaqäna.
It’s okay in that regard.	Uka tuqitxa walikïskiwa.
But that's a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa.
But beyond that, it’s beautiful.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, wali sumawa.
It wasn’t necessary, you know.	Janiw wakiskänti, jumax yatisktawa.

Honestly, I think that would be good for me.	Chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
But he did not know who had left with him.	Ukampis khitis jupamp sarjjäna uk janiw yatkänti.

He said it was important.	Wali wakiskiriwa sasaw säna.
He took it out.	Jupajj uk apsüna.
I'm coming here.	Nayax akan jutta.
If you want to do something well, you have to do it yourself.	Kuns sum lurañ munsta ukhajja, juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
But that doesn't matter.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
It’s not a big deal.	Janiw kuna jach’a lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
But in that respect.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa.
The day isn’t too short.	Uka urux janiw sinti juk’a pachax utjkiti.

There was nothing there.	Ukanjja janiw kunas utjkänti.
There really wasn’t anything else to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha lurañax utjkänti.

So far, everyone is in the country.	Jichhakamax taqiniw uka markanx utji.

But he is like that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
That’s the right thing to do.	Ukax chiqaw sañ muni.
I don't see any reason why it can't be done.	Janiw kuna razonas uñjkti kunatsa jan lurañjamäki ukjja.
I don’t know what to do first.	Nayax janiw kuns nayraqat lurañ yatkti.

And that was it.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa.
But one day it began.	Ukampis mä urux qalltäna.

He asked her what she was planning to do.	Ukat kun lurañsa amtaskta sasaw jisktʼäna.

I’m just getting started.	Nayax jichhakiw qalltawayta.
Maybe he should do that.	Inas jupajj ukham lurañapa.

Not this is the case.	Janiw akax ukhamäkiti.
There is no time limit.	Janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
It is, of course, human.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jaqiwa.
Or he didn't say it.	Jan ukajj janiw siskänti.
Now, let’s do this properly.	Jichhax, akax sum lurañäni.
He was a different kind of person.	Jupajj yaqha kasta jaqënwa.
So, yeah he did that.	Ukhama, jïsa jupax ukham luratayna.
I didn't know what to do out there.	Uka anqan kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.

And that takes some time.	Ukat ukatakix mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.

I’m that weird.	Nayax ukham muspharkañawa.
I really don’t know why.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.

There is nothing you can do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.

He’s a very good student.	Jupax wali suma yatiqiriwa.

And he talked about it.	Ukat jupaw uka toqet parläna.
He took it out of it.	Jupajj uka toqet apsüna.

And it’s okay.	Ukat walikïskiwa.
He decided to leave, he decided not to go.	Jupax sarxañ amtäna, jan sarañ amtäna.

Or it doesn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I definitely gave it to him.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw juparux uk churta.
You don’t need that.	Jumax janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He knew what he was doing.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk sum yatïna.
No one knows why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
That wasn't necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
I know you know how it is.	Nayax yattwa jumax kunjamsa uk yatta.
I didn’t know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
The guy doesn't know what he's saying.	Uka waynax janiw kuntï siski uk yatkiti.
He was a small man.	Jupajj jiskʼa jaqënwa.
But he agreed to it.	Ukampis jupajj iyaw sänwa.
He’s such an amazing person.	Jupax ukham muspharkañ jaqiwa.
None of this will happen.	Ukanakat janiw kunas utjkaniti.
Tell me the truth.	Chiqpach yatiyapxita.
But I don't know that.	Ukampis janiw ukham yatkti.
Every single one of them.	Sapa mayniw uka tuqitxa.
I let it go for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempow jaytawayta.
This one is one.	Aka maynix mä.
I am not sure about that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
He never wanted to use it again.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa ukanak apnaqañ munkänti.
He just felt like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw jikxatasïna.
There was a part of me that needed it more.	Nayan mä chiqaw utjäna, ukaw jukʼamp munasïna.
There is urgent need for more.	Ukanjja, jankʼakiw jukʼamp lurañajj wakisi.
As much as you want to.	Kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhama.
But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
So it is clear what we need to do now.	Ukhamajj kunanaktï jichhajj lurañasa uk qhanaw amuyasi.
It was much better there.	Ukanjja, jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
This world looks worse.	Aka pachax juk’amp jan waliw uñtasi.
I can do it alone.	Naya sapakiw uk lurasmati.
A longer and better day.	Mä juk’amp jaya ukat wali suma uru.
And so on.	Ukat ukhama.
I am so sorry to see how you feel.	Kunjamsa jumajj jikjjatasta uk uñjasajj walpun llakista.
What is happening to me? 	¿Kunas nayar pasaski?
He didn't quite know how to use it properly.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa ukanak sum apnaqañapatak sum yatkänti.
It won’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkaniti.
That means more than I know about you!.	¡Ukajj jumat yatkayäta ukat sipansa jukʼampiw sañ muni!.
No one else did that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
But it never happens.	Ukampis janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Now he knew better.	Jichhajj jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
I want to see it for myself.	Naya pachpaw uk uñjañ munta.
He had felt this way before.	Jupajj nayraw ukham jikjjatasïna.
He had never wanted to do that before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañ munkänti.
The amount of time doesn't matter.	Uka qhawqha tiempojj janiw kunäkisa.
There was nothing to be understood about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas amuyaskänti.
I'm coming.	Nayax jutta.
That’s how good he is.	Ukhamaw jupax wali suma.
He wanted what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk munäna.
But that wasn't the case before that time.	Ukampis uka tiempo nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m sorry about this.	Nayax aka tuqitx llakistwa.
That's not what he does.	Ukajj janiw jupajj lurkiti.
And he’s awesome.	Ukat jupax wali muspharkañawa.
This year was an unusual year.	Jichha marax mä jan uñt’at maraw utjäna.
He didn't want that to happen.	Jupajj janiw ukham pasañap munkänti.
Or, at least.	Jan ukax, mä juk’a.
It doesn’t happen to me.	Janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
Very cool actually.	Wali thaya chiqpachansa.
He’s so cold and mean.	Jupax wali thaya ukat jan wali jaqiwa.
Now it’s like that.	Jichhajj ukhamawa.
But he wants to eat.	Ukampis jupajj manqʼañ muni.
It went really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sum saräna.
There is something important to do.	Kuna wakiskir lurañasa.
I didn’t know exactly.	Janiw sum yatkayätti.
There was a lot of energy.	Ukanx wali ch’amaw utjäna.
It’s a great big big.	Mä jach’a jach’a jach’a.
Much, much less.	Walja, juk’ampi juk’ampi.
You have plenty of time.	Jumax walja tiempow utji.
Let me know what you might have.	Kunas jumatakix utjaspa uk yatiyapxita.
That happened yesterday.	Ukajj qharüruw pasäna.
But he doesn't want to help them.	Ukampis janiw jupanakar yanaptʼañ munkiti.
He was staring at the letter.	Jupajj uka carta uñchʼukiskäna.
It was the only reality.	Ukakiw cheqpach utjäna.
With anyone, really.	Khitimpis, chiqpachansa.
Let’s see what happens.	Kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
So there was no problem there.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis ukan utjkänti.
He refused to go inside.	Jupajj janiw mantañ munkänti.
You have to do it yourself.	Jumaw ukham lurañama.
I’m here myself.	Naya pachpaw akanktxa.
Aren't these people .	¿Janit uka jaqenakajj .
I asked him what he wanted.	Kunsa munta sasaw jisktʼta.
An old car.	Mä nayra auto.
He’s awesome.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa.
I made my own breakfast.	Naya pachpaw desayuno lurayäta.
And it was a very painful experience.	Ukat wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
That’s what it’s about for me.	Ukaw nayatakix uka tuqitxa.
He was in a bad mood.	Jupajj jan wal amuyasïna.
He asked two important questions.	Jupajj pä wakiskir jisktʼanak jisktʼäna.
Nothing more nothing less.	Janiw kunas juk’ampi kunas juk’ampi.
Much quieter more.	Walja amukiw juk’ampi.
He wanted the house.	Jupajj uka uta munäna.
It’s actually pretty nice.	Chiqansa wali sumawa.
I want to give it away.	Nayajj ukanak churañ munta.
They will have more.	Jupanakajj jukʼampiw utjani.
Everyone knows everything.	Taqinipuniw taqi kun yatipxi.
So we went there.	Ukatwa uka cheqar sarapjjta.
I don’t want to know that.	Janiw nayax ukham yatxatañ munkti.
But there seems to be nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
It’s been a wonderful day.	Uka urux wali suma uruw utjawayi.
They don't like what I do to them.	Kuntï jupanakar lurkta ukajj janiw jupanakar gustkiti.
You’re feeling pretty good.	Jumax wali sum jikxatastaxa.
It’s not possible to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't feel that way.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
No, there is more now.	Janiwa, jichhajj jukʼampiw utji.
But it will clearly arrive.	Ukampis qhanaw purini.
That rarely happened.	Ukajj jukʼakiw pasäna.
The house was silent.	Uka utax amukiw jikxatasïna.
It was wonderful to see you.	Jumar uñjasajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He was a very strong man.	Jupajj wali qhuru jaqënwa.
Now that’s pretty easy.	Jichhax ukax wali ch’amawa.
I know better now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sum yatta.
He worked hard at everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa wal chʼamachasïna.
I like what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I just can’t believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It’s a human being.	Ukax mä jaqiwa.
This is impossible to do.	Ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Later, he said so himself.	Qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw ukham säna.
It doesn't matter what you think.	Kuntï amuykta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
There was a slight stir.	Ukhamaw jikjjatasïna.
Let’s see how it works.	Kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
Or anywhere else.	Jan ukajj kawkhansa.
He rolled his eyes.	Jupax nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
He knows that.	Jupajj uk yattwa.
He knows there is no such thing.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkiti uk sum yati.
I want both of them.	Nayax panpachaniw munta.
He was worried about me.	Jupajj nayat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I'm not saying that.	Janiw nayajj uk siskti.
I think you can’t do that.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañaw wakisi.
There was more of something else to do.	Ukanjja, jukʼampiw yaqha lurañajj utjäna.
That doesn't matter now.	Ukajj janiw jichhajj kunäkisa.
You look terrible.	Jumax wali axsarkañ uñnaqaniwa.
I don't know what to do.	Janiw nayajj kuns yatkti.
And he loved her.	Ukat juparux walpun munäna.
These are the most beautiful.	Ukanakax wali sumawa.
But it is not possible to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I doubt it will happen.	Ukajj pasani sasaw pächasta.
He doesn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa yatkiti.
I wanted to give him everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa jupar churañ munta.
It’s very difficult for me.	Nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
But it is not at all like that.	Ukampis janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't know anything about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa kunsa yatkiti.
Two more days to go.	Ukat jukʼamp pä uruw sarañatak utjäna.
How do you .	Kunjamsa jumax .
He only mentioned you a few times.	Jupajj mä qhawqha kutikiw jumat parläna.
Too bad it happened.	Sinti jan waliw ukax pasäna.
I just can’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkänti.
Or in the past.	Jan ukajj nayra tiemponjja.
He told me so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sitäna.
He knew what lay ahead.	Kunas jutïrin pasaspa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He didn't want to do anything more than that.	Jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurañ munkänti.
That last little one, after all.	Uka qhipa jisk’a, taqi kunat sipansa.
Everything is important to me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
Someone was inside me.	Mayniw nayan manqhan utjäna.
Both are necessary.	Panpachaniw wakisi.
But it’s not impossible.	Ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
Winter is coming soon.	Juyphi pachax jank’akiw purini.
I think he knows something.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kuns yati.
It is the .	Ukax uka .
I’ve been coming here for years.	Nayax walja maranakaw akan jutta.
But he didn't say anything to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus kuns siskänti.
He didn't tell them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar siskänti.
That alone is exciting.	Uka sapakix wali kusiskañawa.
But that’s what happened.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He was a human being.	Jupajj jaqënwa.
He’s very, very attractive.	Jupax wali, wali suma uñt’atawa.
I don’t think the person meant anything bad about it.	Nayax janiw uka jaqix uka tuqit jan walinak sañ munkänti.
He didn't know how to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ yatkänti.
The whole house.	Taqi uka uta.
And let’s look at the facts.	Ukat kunatï cheqäki uk uñjañäni.
Something else happened.	Yaqha kunaw pasäna.
It looks awesome.	Wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
I didn't understand this before.	Nayrajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
These are very exciting.	Ukanakajj wali kusiskañawa.
This one is really interesting.	Akax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
He didn't really want it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukanak munkänti.
Nothing here before.	Janiw kunas akan nayrax utjkiti.
He felt the same way about her.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jupat amuyasïna.
This is even more important.	Ukajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
Now this would make an amazing gift.	Jichhax akax mä muspharkañ regalo lurañapawa.
I don’t understand how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw amuykti.
That’s how he feels.	Ukhamaw jupax jikxatasi.
It’s going to be a slow motion.	Ukhamaw saraski.
He wanted to do what was right.	Jupajj kunatï walïki uk lurañwa munäna.
But it wasn’t.	Ukampis ukhamänwa.
I didn't know.	Nayajj janiw yatkayätti.
Not so today.	Janiw jichhürunakanx ukhamäkiti.
Or it doesn't matter.	Jan ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He’s going to you.	Jupax jumaruw saraski.
A good year.	Mä suma mara.
He can do it.	Jupajj uk luraspawa.
No, no, no, no.	Janiwa, janiwa, janiwa.
A day goes by, then three, then a week.	Mä uruw saraski, ukat kimsa, ukat mä semana.
He just realized that.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk amuyäna.
I know, and everyone here knows, where he is.	Nayax yattwa, ukat taqiniw akanx yatipxi, kawkhans jupax jikxatasi ukxa.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Janiw khitis akan qhiparañ munkiti.
Three years ago.	Kimsa mara nayra.
We should do this every morning!.	¡Sapa alwaw ukham lurañasa!.
I didn’t get this.	Nayax janiw akax jikxatkti.
So it doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I need some money.	Kuna qullqis munasini.
I know that it was.	Ukhamänwa uk yattwa.
And do it the way you want it.	Ukat kunjamtï munkta ukham lurañamawa.
He knew what he had to do.	Jupajj kuns lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
I am so glad to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj wal kusista.
That's kind of weird.	Ukajj mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
But that's not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw walïkiti.
Nothing more can be done.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp lurañax utjkaspati.
The question is what to do next.	Uka jisktʼajj kunsa jutïrin lurañasa.
That’s not a good thing.	Ukax janiw askïkiti.
He felt like a different person now.	Jichhajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
He was bedridden for two weeks.	Jupajj pä semanaw ikiñan qheparäna.
But he refused to speak for himself.	Ukampis janiw jupa pachpa arsuñ munkänti.
I don’t get that.	Nayax janiw uk jikxatkti.
But he wanted to know more.	Ukampis jukʼamp yatiñwa munäna.
I can do it, she said.	Nayajj uk lurasmati, sasaw jupajj säna.
I really don’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
For once, I really like it.	Mä kutikiw ukajj nayatakejj wal gustitu.
That’s what he has to do.	Ukaw jupan lurañapa.
And he spoke fondly of you.	Ukat wali munasiñampiw jumat parläna.
And this is even more surprising.	Ukat akax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
And I thought I really liked him.	Ukat jupajj walpun gustitu sasaw amuyayäta.
Thank you so much!!.	Walpun yuspärta!!.
Everything is happening.	Taqi kunas pasaski.
Try not to do it in advance.	Nayratpach jan lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
Will have to do something tomorrow.	Qhipürux kuna lurañas wakisini.
Do this for a week.	Mä semanaw ukham lurañama.
He didn't do these things.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
He wanted to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa munäna.
I was very sad about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
No, it’s not necessary.	Janiwa, janiw wakiskiti.
I'm not saying it's bad.	Janiw jan waliw siskti.
Tell me the real reason.	Chiqpach kunatsa uk yatiyapxita.
I feel a little uncomfortable.	Nayax mä juk’a jan walin jikxatastxa.
He told her about him.	Jupajj jupat yatiyäna.
It doesn’t work well.	Janiw sum irnaqkiti.
It doesn’t last long.	Janiw jaya pachax utjkiti.
Two more beautiful.	Pä juk’ampi suma.
He didn't want one.	Jupajj janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
You need both.	Panpachaniw munasispa.
Why should he do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa.
I didn’t understand them.	Jupanakar janiw sum amuykayätti.
Which he didn't do.	Ukajj janiw jupajj lurkänti.
Everything is good now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I know how you feel.	Kunjamsa jumax jikxatasïta uk sum yatta.
There is a need to do it.	Kuna lurañas wakisi.
I don’t know what suits anyone.	Kunas khitirus askïspa uk janiw yatkti.
That made it worse.	Ukaw jukʼamp jan walinak luräna.
You’re coming with me.	Jumax nayamp chikaw jutta.
Well, that's right.	Ukhama, ukhamawa.
And they don't know what they can't do.	Ukat kuntï jan lurañjamäki uk janiw yatipkiti.
And someone else said.	Ukat maynix sänwa.
It’s a secret.	Ukax mä jamasat uñt’atawa.
He definitely has something to do.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw kuna lurañas utji.
All of this is pretty amazing.	Taqi ukanakax wali muspharkañawa.
Your every job.	Juman sapa lurañama.
He never refused anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus jan munkänti.
Almost two years, one week.	Niya pä mara, mä semana.
Never give up '.	Janipuniw jaytañamäkiti '.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sum yatta.
That you know for sure.	Ukax jumax chiqpachapuniw yatta.
That’s how it worked.	Ukhamaw irnaqäna.
It was never a question.	Janipuniw uka jisktʼajj utjkänti.
There was no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
I just wanted to say that.	Nayax ukhamakiw sañ munta.
The guy knows what he is doing.	Uka waynax kuntï luraski uk sum yati.
He could have done it.	Jupaw uk luraspäna.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
That's a pretty amazing thing.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
There is good reason why this happened.	Ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj wali askiwa.
Well, that doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
And he was alone.	Ukat jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
Not available at this time.	Janiw aka pachanx utjkiti.
He didn’t think so.	Janiw ukham amuykänti.
And for all the reasons.	Ukat taqi kunatsa ukham lurañax wakisispa.
The sooner you do that, the better.	Ukham jankʼak lurasma ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
Now he does it.	Jichhajj uk luri.
So that was pretty cool.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
It was something we did.	Ukajj mä kuntï lurapkta ukhamänwa.
But that is difficult.	Ukampis ukajj chʼamakiwa.
Now, he said about it.	Jichhax, uka tuqitx akham sänwa.
All of this is good for me.	Taqe ukanakajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
Of course, that didn't seem like much.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw sinti askïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
It really was all of these.	Chiqpachansa taqi ukanakaw utjäna.
I know too much about it.	Nayax sinti yattwa.
He went through it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uka toqet sarjjäna.
We are not the same.	Janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
I really want to do that.	Chiqpachansa uk lurañwa munta.
And he had two weeks to do it.	Ukat pä semanaw uk lurañatak utjäna.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Janiw khitimpis parltʼañ munkänti.
And he said yes.	Ukat jupax jïsa sasaw säna.
But he is awesome.	Ukampis jupajj wali muspharkañawa.
But it’s almost like that.	Ukampis niya ukhamakiw.
What do you think will happen?.	¿Kunas utjani sasin amuyta?.
He said there was no one in the house.	Utan janiw khitis utjkiti sasaw säna.
It was like that one day.	Mä urux ukhamänwa.
No one knew what he was doing there alone.	Kuntï ukan sapaki lurkäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
Do whatever you want.	Kuntï munkta uk luram.
These were not available.	Ukanakajj janiw utjkänti.
I want to get out.	Nayax mistuñ munta.
Try to do what you love.	Kuntï munkta uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
And let me tell you.	Ukat nayax yatiyapxita.
But let’s look at everything that happened.	Ukampis taqe kunatï paskäna uk uñjañäni.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nayax wali sum jikxatastxa.
He was staring into the distance in dismay.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jaya cheqar uñchʼukiskäna.
It certainly was for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix ukhamänwa.
I’d say the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw sañ munta.
He did it, you know.	Jupaw uk luräna, jumax yatisktawa.
But you should never do that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
For about a decade or so.	Niya tunka mara jan ukajj jukʼamp maranakaw ukham luräna.
He was right about that.	Jupajj uka toqet cheqapuniw säna.
But that wasn’t the case here.	Ukampis janiw aka cheqan ukhamäkänti.
He couldn't do it now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj uk lurañ puedkänti.
And it still came to him.	Ukat wali sumaw jupar purinïna.
It’s also very popular.	Ukhamaraki wali uñt’atawa.
Like nothing happened.	Kunjamtï jan kunas paskäna ukhama.
But I still feel better.	Ukampis wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
I want to tell you about it.	Nayax uka tuqit yatiyañ munta.
He does it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk luri.
There is no heat.	Janiw kuna junt’u pachas utjkiti.
He seemed to be a nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I personally am not like that right now.	Naya pachpajj janiw jichhajj ukhamäkti.
He was silently stunned.	Jupax amukiw jikxatasïna.
An eye alone can’t do anything.	Mä nayrax sapakix janiw kuns lurkaspati.
I’ve definitely seen that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk uñjta.
Just like he had done before.	Kunjamtï jupajj nayrajj lurkäna ukhama.
But it looks beautiful to me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali sumaw uñjasi.
I can’t do anything about it.	Janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
And that’s what it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamawa.
It’s really good for you.	Chiqpachansa jumatakix wali askiwa.
I felt really bad.	Chiqpachansa jan waliw jikxatasiyäta.
Or tomorrow.	Jan ukajj qharürojj.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Bad, very bad.	Jan wali, wali jan wali.
This was him a year ago.	Akax jupaw mä mara nayrax utjäna.
At this point, no one can do it.	Aka pachanx janiw khitis lurañjamäkiti.
But nothing could have done it.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham lurkaspänti.
But he knew it all too well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yatïna.
A guy doesn’t do that.	Mä waynax janiw ukham lurkiti.
I know how to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ yatta.
In fact, it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
All of these are similar .	Taqi ukanakax ukham uñt'atawa .
He threw himself into it.	Jupajj ukaruw jaqontäna.
I really don’t know that much about him.	Chiqpachansa janiw jupat ukham wal yatkti.
He couldn't do it much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj uk lurañ puedkänti.
There is no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
That’s it for it.	Ukax ukatakix.
I wanted to do that.	Nayajj ukham lurañwa munta.
He did nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kuns lurkänti.
He could have done better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luraspäna.
It was an ominous look,.	Ukajj mä jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa,.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti.
I didn't want that.	Nayajj janiw uk munkayätti.
He looked very sad.	Jupax wali llakitaw uñnaqäna.
But there wasn't much to do about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet walja lurañajj utjkänti.
He obviously did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti, ukajj qhanawa.
I never knew anything.	Janipuniw kunsa yatkayätti.
The work was wonderful.	Uka lurañajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He said it was okay.	Walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
He died about two days later.	Ukat niya pä urunak qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	Jichha tardejj janiw walja tiemponïkti.
It was always mine.	Ukajj sapa kutiw nayatak utjäna.
I didn't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurañ munkayätti.
He said he didn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkti sasaw säna.
It’s a lot of fun for me.	Nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yati.
You know, that would be good.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax wali askïspawa.
So let's do that now.	Ukhamajj jichhajj uk lurañäni.
He asked for more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw uk mayïna.
And that was the case.	Ukat uka tuqitxa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He told me later.	Jupajj qhepatwa sitäna.
I have no idea what’s next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw amuykti.
Well, he’s got the right person.	Ukhama, jupax chiqa jaqiruw puri.
I’m feeling sad.	Nayax llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Nayax jumanakar wasitat uñjañ suyaskta.
Actually, yes.	Chiqpachansa, jïsa.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañ yatkayätti.
You’re not the one.	Janiw jumajj ukhamäkiti.
This time it’s more difficult.	Aka kutix juk’amp ch’amawa.
He’s saying that.	Jupax ukham arsu.
He can do it two, three years.	Jupax pä, kimsa maraw luraspa.
This amazing room.	Aka muspharkañ cuarto.
He would never have done that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.
I have these things.	Nayax ukanak utjitu.
He stayed there for two years.	Jupajj pä maraw ukan qheparäna.
They can’t do it.	Jupanakax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
This is obviously wrong.	Ukajj qhanaw jan walïkiti.
I’m planning on going in with him first thing in the morning.	Nayax jupamp chikaw nayrïr kutix alwax mantañ amtaskta.
That awful, awful place.	Uka jan wali, wali axsarkañ chiqa.
You’re going to be very happy.	Jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
There was no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He didn't say anything to me.	Jupajj janiw nayarojj kuns siskänti.
Things just stayed the same.	Kunanakas ukhamakiw utjäna.
The same day.	Uka pachpa uru.
But he never said that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kunapachas uk siskänti.
So it was a little gift .	Ukhamajj mä jiskʼa regalo ukhamänwa .
That’s exactly what happens.	Ukax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
I’ve told him before.	Nayax nayrax juparux yatiyätwa.
A terrible time.	Mä jan wali tiempo.
He didn’t want to tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus yatiyañ munkänti.
I didn’t have anything to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
The problem has been around for a long time.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj nayratpachaw utji.
I’d like to say more.	Nayax juk’amp arsuñ munta.
Of course, it is impossible.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Maybe we’re the ones.	Inas jiwasax.
But that doesn't mean anything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
But it’s not like that for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know how to do that.	Nayax janiw kunjams ukham lurañax uk yatkti.
That wasn't the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But now there was nothing to do.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
That’s a surprise.	Ukax mä muspharkañawa.
The value of the value.	Ukajj wali askiwa.
I don't want to talk about it.	Janiw uka toqet parlañ munkti.
So it wasn't the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It doesn’t go well.	Janiw sum sarkiti.
But he wanted nothing more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkänti.
He wants to be nice to me, he wants to be nice to you.	Jupax nayamp sum sañ muni, jupax jumamp sum sañ muni.
Very, very difficult.	Wali, wali ch’amawa.
I really wanted nothing more.	Chiqpachansa janiw jukʼamp kuns munkayätti.
This can take hours.	Ukatakejj walja horanakaw munasispa.
He was a wicked man.	Jupajj mä jan wali jaqënwa.
But he knows it well.	Ukampis jupajj uk sum yati.
Everything else doesn’t matter.	Taqi kunas janiw kunäkisa.
He preferred that, of course.	Jupax ukaruw juk’amp munäna, chiqpachansa.
It needs to be done.	Ukax lurañaw wakisi.
He tells her not to rush it.	Jupajj jan jankʼak luramti sasaw säna.
I mean seriously.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw sañ munta.
As he did later.	Kunjamtï qhepat lurkäna ukhama.
¿Jumaxa.	¿Jumaxa.
There are only two of these.	Ukanakax pä sapa mayniw utji.
During the day it goes quietly.	Uka urux ukax amukiw saraski.
He can do such things.	Jupaw ukham lurañanak luraspa.
You know the word.	Jumax uka aru yatisktawa.
Well he is and isn’t.	Suma jupax ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he really knew how to handle it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw kunjams apnaqañ yatïna.
He was looking at me.	Jupajj nayaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
And no one really wants that.	Ukat janiw khitis chiqpachansa uk munkiti.
And he won’t do it.	Ukat janiw uk lurkaniti.
So it’s really hard.	Ukhama chiqpachansa ch’amawa.
That says a lot.	Ukax walpun arsu.
But this time it wasn’t.	Ukampis aka kutin janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurkänti.
I understand how I feel about the current situation.	Jichha tiempon utjki ukanak uñjasajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum amuyta.
I want to do it again.	Nayax wasitat lurañ munta.
No one really wants to do that.	Janiw khitis chiqpachansa ukham lurañ munkiti.
I didn’t make any money, I had nowhere to go.	Janiw qullqi jikxatkti, janiw kawkirus sarañax utjkitänti.
Let’s see for yourself.	Juma pachpa uñjañäni.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw uk luräna.
Of course it was.	Chiqansa ukhamänwa.
Someone has to do it.	Maynix lurañapawa.
That’s not the case and you know why.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti ukat kunatsa uk yatisktawa.
He can't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkaspati.
Another busy morning.	Yaqha ch’am tukuñ alwax.
That’s the way it is now.	Ukhamaw jichhax utji.
They know that.	Jupanakax uk yatipxi.
No one wanted to take it from him.	Janiw khitis jupat apsuñ munkänti.
There is a lot of value for that.	Ukatakix wali askiwa.
Now I question everything.	Jichhajj taqe kunwa jisktʼasta.
Something with us in the room.	Kunas jiwasamp chikaw cuarto ukan utji.
He certainly is.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamawa.
It was almost cruel.	Niya qhuru chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I can't do it.	Janiw nayajj lurirjamäkti.
Everything a good man can be, he is.	Taqi kunatix mä suma jaqix utjaspa, jupax ukhamawa.
He doesn't know where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw yatkiti.
I decided to work on my own.	Naya pachpaw irnaqañ amtawayta.
That’s it, of course.	Ukax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
This can take a lot of time.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow munasispa.
That takes care of that.	Ukaw ukanak sum uñji.
Not a bad kind.	Janiw mä jan wali kasta.
There’s something that happened.	Kuna kunas pasäna.
But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
Somewhere, at least it’s been there.	Mä chiqan, mä juk’a pachax ukan jikxatasi.
He seemed to want to tell me something.	Jupajj kuns yatiyañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
There is nothing he can do now.	Jichhajj janiw kunas jupajj lurkaspati.
I never thought it would happen before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañajj utjkaspati sasin amuyirïkti.
I felt good about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatasiyäta.
In fact, it was.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
He remained very quiet.	Jupajj wali amukiw qheparäna.
I started the sentence myself.	Naya pachpaw uka arunak qalltawayta.
I’m fine with that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali askiwa.
That’s it, isn’t it.	Ukax ukhamawa, ¿janich ukhamäki.
He got the job.	Jupaw uka trabajo katoqäna.
He didn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw uk yatiñ munkänti.
Another big chunk.	Yaqha jach’a ch’uqi.
This time the boy was very quiet.	Jichha kutix uka waynax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
It’s so very difficult.	Ukhama wali ch’amawa.
I need help.	Nayajj yanaptʼa munta.
He makes a careful decision.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw mä amtar puri.
I really hope he does.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukham lurañapatakiw suytʼaskta.
I don't know why he didn't.	Kunatsa jan ukham luräna uk janiw yatkti.
It’s a pleasure to ride again.	Ukax wasitat kayuk sarañax wali kusiskañawa.
That’s just the way it is.	Ukax ukhamakiw.
Something really interesting.	Kunas chiqpachapunix wali askïspa.
I didn’t want to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ munkayätti.
I had no idea what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
Several times, in fact.	Walja kutiw, chiqpachansa.
That’s because it’s beautiful.	Ukax kunatix wali sumawa.
He wants to live.	Jupax jakañ muni.
Maybe we will do that.	Inas jiwasajj ukham lurañäni.
He didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti.
It’s still warm.	Wali junt’u.
He didn't know who he was.	Jupajj janiw khitïnsa uk yatkänti.
There is nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkiti.
Eventually someone saw him.	Qhipharux mayniw jupar uñjäna.
It stayed for a long time.	Ukajj walja tiempow qheparäna.
I'm still feeling sad.	Wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
And you will too .	Ukat jumax ukhamarakiw .
I thought you were someone else.	Nayajj jumajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
But he had seen his own eyes before, and many times.	Ukampis nayranakap pachpaw nayrajj uñjäna, ukat walja kutiw uñjäna.
There are two facts.	Pä chiqaw utji.
And that’s okay.	Ukat ukax walikïskiwa.
And that’s what I like about it.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Then he went back to his house.	Ukat wasitatwa utapar sarxäna.
It would be nice not to.	Jan ukham lurasax wali askïspawa.
I’ve done both.	Nayax panpachaniw lurawayta.
I knew that for sure.	Ukjja, cheqpach yatiyätwa.
I just feel like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
That is rarely the case.	Ukajj jukʼakiw utji.
He was telling her something.	Jupajj kunsa jupar siskäna.
But that doesn't seem to be the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
But it happens every time.	Ukampis sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
I'm not going to go.	Nayajj janiw sarkti.
It worked like this for two weeks.	Pä semanaw ukham irnaqäna.
This was neither the first nor the last such incident.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr jan ukajj qhep qhepa ukham jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
And he doesn’t know that.	Ukat janiw uk yatkiti.
I want to do this well.	Nayax uk sum lurañ munta.
He was not in place.	Jupajj janiw cheqan utjkänti.
What you see is not good.	Kun uñjasajj janiw walïkiti.
This guy seemed to know a lot about this country.	Aka waynax aka markat wal yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
There was a tremendous amount of wind.	Ukanx wali jach’a thaya ch’amampiw utjäna.
He is not that bad.	Jupajj janiw ukham jan walïkiti.
I was in a lot of pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
There is no charge for this.	Ukatakix janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
That was about two years ago.	Ukajj niya pä mara nayraw pasäna.
It was really that.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
There will be no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
That's a good thing.	Ukajj walikïskiwa.
It lasted a long time.	Ukajj walja tiempow utjäna.
The house is very nice.	Uka utax wali sumawa.
That’s what it means.	Ukax ukham sañ muni.
He started living with her.	Jupampiw jakañ qalltäna.
I think there’s room for that.	Nayax ukatakix mä chiqaw utji sasaw amuyta.
I don't remember what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk janiw amtaskti.
I never really understood that.	Janipuniw uk cheqpachapun amuyirïkti.
Well, maybe he is.	Ukhama, inas jupax.
It feels good this morning.	Jichha alwax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
It’s going to be that way tonight.	Jichha arumax ukhamakiw utjani.
Why, I don’t know when.	Kunatsa, kunapachas uk janiw yatkti.

I don’t need anything.	Janiw kunas munaskiti.
I don’t remember yet.	Janiw jichhakamax amtaskti.
He died two years later.	Pä mara qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
Of course, it really isn’t.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
That wasn't the first time he'd said it to her.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr kuti jupar siskänti.
But it wasn't, and he knew it.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, ukat uk sum yatïna.
He is a very tall man.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqewa.
Who will do it first?.	¿Khitis nayraqat lurani?.
He still didn't know enough about her.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupat jan sum yatkänti.
It’s a fact he was.	Mä chiqaw jupax ukhamänwa.
I love everything so much.	Nayax taqi kuns walpun munasta.
He didn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkänti.
Maybe the same night.	Inas uka pachpa arumax.
An opportunity, that was it.	Mä oportunidad, ukax ukhamänwa.
I'm not saying it.	Janiw nayajj siskti.
He definitely needed two.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw pä munasïna.
I’m the only one who knows how to do it.	Naya sapakiw uk lurañ yatta.
It really hasn’t been that long.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham jaya tiempox utjkiti.
That wasn't him.	Ukajj janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
I like it myself.	Naya pachpaw wali munta.
Maybe you need it.	Inas jumajj ukajj wakischispa.
He looked a little worried.	Jupajj mä jukʼa llakitaw uñnaqäna.
I think this is really fun.	Nayax amuyta akax chiqpachans kusiskañawa.
That and that was someone with me.	Uka ukat ukax mayniw nayamp chik utjäna.

He knows what really happened.	Kunatï cheqpachapun paskäna uk jupajj sum yati.

I was disappointed this time last year.	Nayax aka kutix nayrïr marax llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I've heard it.	Uk istʼta.
That was not the case today.	Ukajj janiw jichha tiempon utjkänti.
And it happened a long time ago.	Ukat wali nayraw pasäna.
No one really understood what was happening.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw khitis cheqapuni amuykänti.
We will do the same next month.	Jutïr phaxsinx ukhamarakiw lurañäni.
But it feels like that.	Ukampis ukham jikjjatasi.
It doesn’t do anything wrong.	Janiw jan walinak lurkiti.
That’s what I did.	Ukhamaw nayax lurawayta.
He likes her a lot.	Jupajj walpun jupar gusti.
He immediately alerted the police.	Jupax jank’akiw policiaruw yatiyäna.
It's not necessary.	Janiwa wakiskiti.
Now it’s awesome.	Jichhax wali muspharkañawa.
But this morning.	Ukampis jichha alwajj.
He thought no one could do it.	Janiw khitis uk lurkaspati sasaw amuyäna.
I don’t really know.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix yatkti.
I’m so sorry for the pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
Not again, either.	Janiw mayampsa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He was forcefully right.	Jupajj chʼamampiw cheq parläna.
What is a?.	¿Kunas mä?.
But that seems impossible.	Ukampis ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
He has no one else.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkiti.
He told me the following.	Jupajj akham sasaw sitäna.
That’s your responsibility.	Ukax jumanakan lurañamawa.
Or a few days later.	Jan ukajj mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa ukham luraspa.
That’s what he did.	Ukhamaw jupajj luräna.
You’re good to me, too.	Jumax nayatakix wali askiwa, ukhamaraki.
A little bit of a snowflake.	Mä juk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.

Very, very, great guy.	Wali, wali, jach’a jaqiwa.

And that’s exactly what it is.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
Nothing ever matters.	Janiw kunas kunapachas wakiskiti.
You can’t make stuff like that up.	Janiw ukham yänak lurañjamäkiti.
Tell us a bit about yourself.	Juma pachpat mä juk’a yatiyapxita.
But that is not a good thing to do.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sum lurañjamäkiti.
He looks happy anyway.	Jupax kunjamatsa kusisit uñnaqaniwa.
He spoke faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw parläna.
Very long time actually.	Wali jaya tiempow chiqpachansa.
But that is not what you want.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
But that's not so bad.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
That’s what threw me.	Ukaw nayar jaqontäna.

I don't know what the problem is.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis uk yatkti.
I don't know when that time will come.	Kunapachas uka tiempojj purini uk janiw yatkti.

He felt good tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.

You don’t have to do anything.	Janiw kuns lurañamäkiti.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamaw sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
This process can take years.	Uka lurañatakejj walja maranakaw munasispa.

It really seems like that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
I love him so much.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta.
I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti.
I’m pretty sure we’ll do that.	Nayax wali sum yatta, ukham lurañäni.
Maybe a little more is needed.	Inas mä jukʼa jukʼamp wakischispa.
It had to be done well.	Suma lurañaw wakisïna.
He threw it away immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw jaqontäna.
I strongly believe he knows this.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw amuyasta jupax uk yati.
And he talked about it.	Ukat jupajj uka toqetwa parläna.
Instead, he didn’t.	Jan ukasti, janiw ukham lurkänti.
So it never happened.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I understand that.	Nayax uk amuyasta.
So good for you!!.	Ukhamajj jumatakix wali askiwa!!.
But one of the.	Ukampis mä.
And it’s still beautiful.	Ukat wali sumawa.
But this can be seen from another perspective.	Ukampis ukajj yaqha toqetwa uñjasispa.

They have no reason to.	Jupanakax janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
It’s what you want to do.	Ukax kuntix jumax lurañ munkta ukawa.
He didn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa munkänti.
I can’t do that tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
That doesn't mean anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.

If you accept that, you will feel better.	Uk iyaw säta ukhaxa, wali sumwa jikxatasïta.
No, it doesn’t exist.	Janiwa, janiw utjkiti.
But he knew what he was doing.	Ukampis kunsa luri uk sum yatïna.
He didn't know how to use it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatkänti.
You don’t want that.	Jumax janiw uk munktati.
I don't know much about these.	Ukanakat janiw sum yatkti.
This is really important.	Ukajj cheqapuniw wali wakiskiriwa.
That’s what this movie is.	Ukax aka película ukawa.
You should never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti.
He did everything for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj taqe kunwa luräna.
These are the reasons we have them.	Ukanakaw kunatsa utjistu.
So he couldn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurkaspänti.
No one said a thing about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet mä kuns arskänti.
I’m not sure where the other one went.	Maynix kawkirus saräna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Eventually someone decides to make new rules though.	Qhipharux mayniw machaq kamachinak lurañ amti ukampis.
And why not.	Ukat kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
Now the time has come.	Jichhajj tiempow purini.
But it’s not impossible.	Ukampis janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Because these people know better.	Kunatix aka jaqinakax juk’amp sum yatipxi.
It’s morning coffee.	Ukax alwax café satawa.
Who knows where it is.	Khitis kawkhans uk yati.
There’s nothing more to it.	Janiw juk’ampi kunas utjkiti.
He thought that was the right thing to do.	Ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I’m about that.	Nayax uka tuqitxa.
I had no idea how he would react.	Kunjamsa jupajj kuns lurani uk janiw amuykayätti.
That’s what you’re supposed to do.	Ukhamaw jumax lurañama.
So he decided to do it himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa lurañ amtäna.
That is not what we need.	Ukajj janiw jiwasatak wakiskiti.
Except for me, of course.	Jan ukasti nayat sipansa, chiqpachansa.

You’ve got a lot of energy.	Jumax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
I don’t want to get into it.	Janiw nayax ukar mantañ munkti.
Of course, I never really could.	Chiqansa, janipuniw chiqpachansa ukham lurirjamäkti.
So the question was put to him.	Ukatwa uka jisktʼajj jupar jisktʼasïna.
That wasn't us.	Ukajj janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkänti.

And that was a wonderful thing.	Ukat ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
Today seems to be the perfect time for that.	Jichhürunakanxa, ukatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.

So another time.	Ukhamajj yaqha kuti.
There was nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkänti.

I can’t have him there today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw juparux ukan utjkaspati.
The answer is as follows.	Ukax akham sañ muni.

He gave everything.	Jupaw taqe kunsa churäna.

There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

So that's a good thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj walikïskiwa.
But no one understood.	Ukampis janiw khitis amuykänti.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

Anyway, thanks again.	Kawkhansa, mayamp yuspärta.

He was very surprised.	Jupajj wal muspharäna.
It wasn’t anything like that in the past.	Nayra pachanx janiw kunas ukhamäkänti.

That’s a long way off.	Ukax mä jaya jaqiwa.
So it's a little bit.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa.
There is no time.	Janiw pachax utjkiti.
It was much more interesting.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.

It was a very nice experience.	Ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
There will be nothing, nothing at all.	Janiw kunas utjkaniti, janipuniw kunas utjkaniti.

Of course, it never happened.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

For one thing, of course.	Mä tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

But somehow it was.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukhamänwa.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.

I was often surprised by this.	Uk uñjasajj walja kutiw wal muspharta.
I’m going to be honest with you.	Nayax jumamp chika chiqapar sarnaqañ munta.
He said it so quickly.	Ukham jankʼakiw uk säna.
That doesn’t matter ultimately.	Ukax janiw kunas qhipharux wakiskiti.
And it worked for me.	Ukat nayatakix wali askiwa.
It took him a moment to realize what.	Mä jukʼa tiempow kunas uk amuyasïna.
He told me that privately, of course.	Jupax sapakiw uk sitäna, chiqpachansa.
For the first time he saw her as beautiful.	Nayrïr kutiw jupar suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham uñjäna.

And he was very upset.	Ukat jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I really don’t have that much money.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham qullqix utjkituti.
I had no idea where he could be.	Kawkhansa jupajj utjaspa uk janiw amuykayätti.
He said he doesn’t remember much of that night.	Uka arumax janiw sinti amtaskti sasaw säna.

And he asked the question.	Ukat jisktʼäna.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.

And that’s all there is to it.	Ukat ukakiw utji.
I look forward to seeing him better every day.	Jupar sapa uru jukʼamp sum uñjañ suytʼaskta.

This obviously seemed impossible.	Ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa, ukajj qhanawa.
I’ve given it up for a long time.	Nayax wali jaya tiempow ukanak jaytawayta.

He created it to be done.	Jupax lurañatakiw lurawayi.

And he is going to do bad things.	Ukat jupax jan walinak lurañwa saraski.

Now this is very important.	Jichhax akax wali wakiskiriwa.
You just can’t do it.	Jumax ukhamakiw lurasma.

And I was no different.	Ukat nayajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.

He’s a very stupid guy.	Jupax wali loqhe jaqiwa.

No one really knows the truth.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kunatï cheqäki uk yatkiti.

He wanted nothing more.	Jupajj janiw kunas ukat jukʼamp munkänti.

He didn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.

I left a lot of stuff behind.	Walja yänak jaytawayta.
I don’t think I’ll ever be able to do that at this point.	Nayax janiw kunapachas aka pachanx ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I don't know how to handle it.	Janiw kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatkti.

He did it for the guy.	Jupajj uk luräna.

You can do these things well.	Jumaw ukanak sum lurasma.

He pulled it off pretty well.	Jupax wali sum apsüna.
Of course, there was nothing to it.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas uka tuqitxa utjkänti.
I’ve never seen him around here before.	Nayax janiw nayrax juparux aka jak’an uñjkti.
He is doing it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luraski.
He didn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkänti.
He seemed to be someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

Of course he was.	Chiqansa jupax ukhamänwa.
He went back to sleep.	Jupajj wasitatwa ikiñar sarjjäna.

He chooses to live on his own.	Jupa pachpaw jakañ amti.

He was the one who knew it.	Jupaw uk yatïna.

As far as I’m concerned it’s okay.	Naya tuqitxa walikïskiwa.
Let me know if that works for you.	Ukax jumatakix walikïskiti janicha uk yatiyapxita.

He did his job.	Jupaw lurañap luräna.

Not that I wanted to do nothing about it.	Janiw uka toqet jan kun lurañ munkayätti.
But he’s not like that, either.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, ukhamaraki.
He had been gone for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan sarjjäna.

You don’t want to say anything.	Jumax janiw kuns sañ munktati.

Tell him something.	Kunas jupar yatiyañama.

I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk creykti.
He had never done this before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
So okay, as much as you want.	Ukhamajj walikïskiwa, kunjamtï munkta ukhama.
He told them what he thought.	Jupajj kunsa amuyi uk jupanakar yatiyäna.
How does this happen? 	¿Kunjamatsa ukajj pasaspa?
Anyone can do that.	Khitis ukham luraspa.
Nothing about that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.

Nobody liked it.	Janiw khitirus gustkänti.
But there is no problem.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
There’s nothing there.	Janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
Now.	Jichha.
But that's already not enough.	Ukampis ukajj niyaw jan walïkiti.
There was nothing like it .	Janiw kunas ukham utjkänti .
He’ll do it for you.	Jupaw uk lurani.
I’ve done this twice before.	Nayax pä kutiw nayrax ukham lurawayta.

Maybe next time!.	Inas jutïr kutin!.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He says why.	Jupax kunatsa sasaw saraki.

And everyone else, really.	Ukat taqiniw, chiqpachansa.
So it didn't feel right.	Ukhamajj janiw askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
I want more power more.	Nayax juk’amp ch’amampiw juk’amp munta.
That’s just not right.	Ukax ukhamakiw jan walïkiti.
But you don’t want to say that.	Ukampis janiw ukham sañ munktati.
But that is pretty obvious.	Ukampis ukajj wali qhanawa.
I want to strongly emphasize this.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali ch’amampiw arsuñ munta.
No one could do it half as well.	Janiw khitis chikat ukham sum lurkaspänti.

I’m not saying it’s impossible.	Janiw nayax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham siskti.
He will have no problem.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.

A good night, indeed.	Mä suma arumaw, chiqpachansa.

Why is it so? 	¿Kunatsa?
And it all happened so fast.	Ukat taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.

In fact, there is nothing.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas utjkiti.

No one else can do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati.
There was that night.	Uka arumaw utjäna.

It was a great night.	Mä jachʼa arumaw utjäna.

And so it is .	Ukat ukhamarakiw uka .
He knew that for a long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow uk yatïna.

But he is nothing.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kunäkisa.
Let’s do something.	Kunsa lurañäni.

The real book.	Chiqpach libro.
I’m telling you the truth.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw sista.

It will do the same thing.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw lurani.

If anyone knew less than I did, he knew better.	Khitis nayat jukʼamp jan yatkaspa ukhajja, jukʼamp sumwa yatïna.

There’s one thing, or it’s not.	Mä kunaw utji, jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There really is nothing for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
He was a bit of a bad guy.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jan wali jaqënwa.

He wanted to know more.	Jupajj jukʼamp yatiñwa munäna.
No one needs more.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp munaskiti.

He didn't like her.	Jupajj janiw jupar gustkänti.

He decided to do it in two ways.	Jupax pä tuqit lurañ amtäna.

This is especially true for food.	Ukajj manqʼañatakejj jukʼampiw uñjasi.
I’ve never seen him so happy.	Janipuniw jupar ukham kusisit uñjkti.
He’s a different kind of person.	Jupax yaqha kasta jaqiwa.
These are nice, but not necessary.	Ukanakax wali sumawa, ukampis janiw wakiskiti.
I know that for myself.	Naya pachpaw uk yatta.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.

And he will do it.	Ukat jupax uk lurani.
Honestly, something is better than nothing.	Chiqpachansa, kunas jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
And another, and another.	Ukat yaqha, ukat yaqha.

Well, it was a nice one.	Ukhama, wali sumawa.
It wasn’t something she did for him.	Janiw mä kuntï jupatak lurkäna ukhamäkänti.

This time he said so.	Jichha kutix ukham säna.

And there is only one that matters most.	Ukat mä sapakiw utji, ukax jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.

But, it’s still important.	Ukampis, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.

And kind of cool.	Ukat mä kasta thaya.

You’re a human being.	Jumax jaqïtawa.

And you know, there’s not much you can do about this.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa, janiw aka tuqitx sinti lurañjamäkiti.

That’s why he loved her so much.	Ukatwa jupar wal munasïna.

He didn't know what to do with it all.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanak kun lurañsa yatkänti.

He immediately went with her.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupamp chika sarjjäna.

But, that’s what’s happening.	Ukampis, ukax kunas pasaski.

He told me everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa yatiyäna.

At the time, anything seemed possible.	Uka tiemponjja, kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.

So no one is not here.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis jan akan utjkiti.

But he was really afraid.	Ukampis cheqapuniw ukham ajjsaräna.

And you can do the same.	Ukat jumajj ukhamarakiw lurasma.
And he was like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamänwa.
That meant something.	Ukajj mä kunaw sañ munäna.

Let's see if that works.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk uñjañäni.

And the future certainly looks bright.	Ukat chiqpachansa jutïr pachax wali sumaw uñjasi.

Or at least that’s what it looks like.	Jan ukax mä juk’a pachax ukham uñt’atawa.
I understand how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum amuyta.
There was no such thing at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
He moved faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He repeated it many times.	Walja kutiw ukham wasitat arsüna.
You can’t be right there.	Janiw jumax uka chiqanx chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
But it’s still fun.	Ukampis wali kusiskañawa.

But that doesn't want it.	Ukampis ukajj janiw munkiti.

Everything here is fantastic.	Taqi kunas akan utjki ukax wali muspharkañawa.
Actually, it's not that bad.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham jan walïkiti.
He asked her to do so.	Ukham lurañapatakiw jupar mayïna.
The point here is that bigger is better.	Aka chiqanx juk’amp jach’a juk’amp askiwa sañ muni.
Very large.	Walja jach’a.
That's what I had.	Ukaw nayajj utjäna.
I don't know exactly how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Kuntï lurkäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw ukham uñjkti.
Of course, that’s not the case.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
You really are beautiful.	Chiqpachansa jumax wali sumawa.

And he, too, kind of started.	Ukat jupax, ukhamarakiw mä juk’a qalltäna.

There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
That’s what happened to him.	Ukaw jupajj pasäna.
You can only do that so many times.	Ukham walja kutikiw ukham lurasma.
I’m still afraid of it.	Nayax wali axsaratwa.
Last time someone asked that.	Qhep qhepa kuti mayniw ukham jisktʼäna.
If it’s good enough for you it’s good enough.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa ukax wali askiwa.
That's what he meant.	Ukham sañ munäna.

Everything is going great so far.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw jichhakamax saraski.

He did not want to live anywhere else.	Jupajj janiw yaqha cheqan jakañ munkänti.
He didn't know how to drink.	Jupajj janiw umañ yatkänti.
He’s a really nice guy.	Chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
He doesn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkiti.
Well, it really doesn’t.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’ve been wanting to go out for a long, long time.	Nayax wali jaya, jaya pachaw mistuñ munta.
I want to know about it.	Nayax uka tuqit yatxatañ munta.
Here’s what’s going on.	Akax kunatix utjki ukawa.
The man was like that.	Uka jaqejj ukhamänwa.
And .	Ukat .
Not that he wasn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
I skipped breakfast every day.	Nayax sapa uruw desayuno ukx jaytawayta.
He went quietly.	Jupajj amukiw saräna.
I don’t remember him.	Janiw jupat amtaskti.
If you want to.	Jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
I didn't do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
But winter is coming soon.	Ukampis juyphi pachax jankʼakiw purini.
He looked a little worried now.	Jichhax mä juk’a llakitaw uñnaqäna.
No one can say no.	Janiw khitis janiw sañjamäkiti.
It was a wonderful night.	Uka arumax wali sumapunïnwa.

That’s pretty quick.	Ukax wali jank’akiw.
I want to go to him.	Nayajj jupar sarañ munta.
But it doesn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkiti.
He loved it then.	Jupajj uka tiempon wal munasïna.
Now there is nothing.	Jichhax janiw kunas utjkiti.
So it's not possible to do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It was either him or us.	Jupaw jan ukajj jiwasajj ukhamänwa.
That’s the way it is here.	Ukhamaw aka chiqanx utji.
He spoke quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw parläna.
The speaker gave him money.	Uka parlir jaqejj qollqe churäna.
They have one next to us and they have one next to us.	Jupanakax mä jiwasan jak’an utji ukat jupanakax mä jiwasan jak’an utji.
He couldn't talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ puedkänti.
And so so very good.	Ukat ukhama ukhama wali suma.
I do not see that problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw nayajj uñjkti.

There is truth in this.	Uka tuqitxa chiqaw utji.
It’s okay for me.	Nayatakix walikïskiwa.
That’s amazing now.	Ukax jichhax muspharkañawa.
I know everything about him.	Jupat taqe kunwa yatta.
He barely moved.	Jupajj jukʼakiw sarnaqäna.
They are a lot of fun for me.	Jupanakax nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
I would say the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw sañ munta.
Everything is very difficult.	Taqi kunas wali ch’amawa.
I could see it happening.	Ukham luraskäna uk sum uñjta.
Well, it’s too young for me.	Ukhama, nayatakix wali waynawa.
He wasn't sure how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Which he obviously likes.	Ukax qhanaw juparux gusti.
I just can't stand it.	Nayajj janiw uk aguantañjamäkiti.
But he can't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkaspati.
Of course, no one thought that was possible.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykänti.
It doesn’t exist, and may never exist.	Ukax janiw utjkiti, ukat inas janipuniw utjkaspati.

That’s exactly what he wanted.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munäna.
That’s what we all have.	Ukax taqiniw utjistu.
There was no such person.	Janiw ukham jaqix utjkänti.

In terms of timing, too.	Tiempo tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.

You’re just about that.	Jumax uka tuqitxa ukhamakiw jikxatasïta.

He is better in every way.	Jupajj sapa toqet jukʼamp sumawa.
Because this was him.	Kunatix akax jupax ukhamänwa.

So he said somehow.	Ukatwa kunjamatsa säna.
No one knew anything.	Janiw khitis kuns yatkänti.
I can’t find it now.	Jichhax janiw jikxatkti.
You’re feeling good.	Jumax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
I never wanted anyone more.	Janipuniw khitirus jukʼamp munkti.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw uk siskänti.
That was never the case.	Ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He talked about it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa parläna.
I see him almost every day.	Niya sapa uruw jupar uñjta.
He loved her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna.
But there seems to be a possibility.	Ukampis mä kunaw utjaspa sasaw amuyasi.
A kind of .	Mä kasta .
So far, no one has been able to do it.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis lurañjamäkiti.
One thing is fine.	Mä kunas walikïskiwa.
He had done this twice before.	Jupajj nayrajj pä kutiw ukham luratayna.
He looks bad.	Jupax jan wali uñnaqaniwa.
I loved it so much.	Ukar walpun munasta.
The answer was as follows.	Ukajj akham sänwa.
He wondered how long it would take.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He never quite knew why.	Kunatsa uk janipuniw sum yatkänti.
Everything is completely clear.	Taqi kunas taqpach qhanawa.
She was immediately shocked.	Ukat jankʼakiw wal muspharäna.
I’m sure there’s nothing there.	Nayax yatxatwa janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
It wasn't necessary.	Janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
That's not the way it works.	Ukham lurasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't understand that.	Jupajj janiw uk amuykiti.

It gets better and better.	Ukax juk’amp suma ukat juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He can't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkaspati.
Which he certainly was.	Ukax chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
There is no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti.
But it really happened.	Ukampis cheqapuniw pasäna.
And in that respect.	Ukat uka tuqitxa.
In fact, he is.	Chiqansa, jupax ukhamawa.
Rather, he is.	Jan ukasti, jupax ukhamawa.
Faster, he thought.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw sasaw amuyäna.
We’ll see more about that tomorrow.	Uka tuqitx qharüruw juk’amp uñjañäni.
You can do the same thing.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw lurasma.

But he knew what he had to do.	Ukampis kunas lurañapa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
Not before, not now.	Janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti, jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't want to see you.	Jupajj janiw jumar uñjañ munkiti.
He shook it off.	Jupax ch’allxtayäna.

And what needs to be done.	Ukat kuna lurañas wakisispa.
Of course, I know better than that.	Chiqansa, nayax uka tuqit jukʼamp sum yatta.
Of course, it’s not.	Chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
And now he decided to move to a new place.	Ukat jichhax machaq chiqar sarxañ amtäna.
You don’t need to do any more.	Janiw juk’amp lurañax wakiskiti.
The house is beautiful, very comfortable.	Uka utax wali sumawa, wali sumawa.

It’s not a bit like that.	Janiw mä juk’a ukhamäkiti.

That’s what you need to do.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi.

Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa säna.
He doesn’t want to do anything.	Jupax janiw kuns lurañ munkiti.
I told him there would be no more.	Janiw jukʼamp utjkaniti sasaw sista.
Don't forget.	Jan armasimti.
I don't want to go.	Nayajj janiw sarañ munkti.
He hit the ball very well.	Jupax wali sumaw pelot ch’allt’äna.
Of course, that’s what matters right now.	Chiqansa, ukax jichhax wali wakiskiriwa.
But there was no money for it.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw qullqix utjkänti.
Do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk luram.

And in terms of time.	Ukat tiempo tuqitxa.
About half the time it’s good.	Niya chikat pachax wali askiwa.

There was someone there.	Ukanjja mayniw utjäna.
I’ve been going there for years.	Walja maranakaw ukar saraskta.
There's a jaya.	Kunatsa jaya.
He didn't know why he had done this to himself.	Kunatsa jupa pachpa ukham luratayna uk janiw yatkänti.
But it’s not the same thing.	Ukampis janiw pachpa jan walïkiti.
Or we, either.	Jan ukax jiwasax, jan ukax.
I’m sure many of these are beautiful.	Nayax yatxatwa, walja ukanakax wali sumawa.
In fact, he really didn't know what to say to her.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa janiw kunsa jupar sañ yatkänti.

That’s what he does.	Ukaw jupajj luri.

He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
And it’s really, really good.	Ukat chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali sumawa.

I really, really enjoyed it.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I don’t remember it.	Janiw nayax amtaskti.
But it will actually take longer than that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow munasini.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
And so it goes.	Ukat ukhamaw saraski.
He spoke with great care.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw parläna.
It’s not like you have to do it every day.	Janiw sapa uru lurañax wakiski ukhamäkiti.
He was doing it more and more.	Jupajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw uk luraskäna.
He said he didn’t mean anything.	Jupax janiw kuns sañ munkiti sasaw säna.
You may do this safely.	Ukjja inas jan kuna jan waltʼäwin lurasma.

Well, it really is.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
I want to make it about me.	Nayax nayat lurañ munta.

It's even better.	Ukax juk'amp askiwa.
Such a beautiful book.	Ukham suma libro.
The house is too big.	Uta sinti jach’a.
So he didn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
I want that for you.	Nayax jumatakix uk munta.
I know what this looks like, though.	Nayax yattwa kunjams akax uñtasi, ukampis.
Maybe two or three years.	Inas pä jan ukax kimsa mara.

It doesn’t really happen.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
He was intrigued by it now.	Jupajj jichhajj uka toqet wal muspharäna.

He was looking around.	Jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.

And it was almost time.	Ukat niyaw tiempojj purinïna.

I know it will take longer, yes.	Nayax yattwa juk’amp pachaw munasini, jïsa.
He just understood that.	Jupax ukhamakiw amuyasïna.
So what he thinks about it is important.	Ukhamajj uka toqet kuntï jupajj amuyki ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But I don't know how to do it properly.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk sum lurañ yatkti.

You should never leave him.	Janiw kunapachas jupar jaytañamäkiti.

You think you know what you want.	Jumax kuntï munkta uk yatisktawa sasaw amuyta.

I knew exactly what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk sum yatiyäta.

Perhaps it is necessary to do so.	Inas ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
It’s hard for anyone, maybe.	Khitirus ch’amawa, inas.
There is nothing to say.	Janiw kunas sañjamäkiti.

He left the country.	Jupajj uka markat sarjjäna.
But it doesn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurkiti.
He didn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
He repeats it again.	Jupax wasitatwa ukham arsu.
There was no way to do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
He longs to see you again.	Jupajj jumar wasitat uñjañ wal muni.
There is nothing, and never.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, ukat janipuniw.

He didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
So, it’s a whole other world out there.	Ukhama, mä taqpach yaqha pachaw ukanx utji.
No one knows the answer.	Janiw khitis yatkiti.

A new film.	Mä machaq película.
He didn't want all that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa munkänti.
I’m a real adult.	Nayax chiqpach jilïr jaqïtwa.
It may never be one of its own.	Inas janipuniw jupa pachpat maynix utjkaspati.
I don’t think you think so.	Nayax janiw jumax ukham amuyirïkti.
That’s what he thinks.	Ukhamaw jupax amuyi.
Without it, there would be nothing.	Jan ukax janiw kunas utjkaspati.
I have some money myself.	Naya pachpaw mä juk’a qullqix utjitu.
That’s not very good.	Ukax janiw sinti askïkiti.
So it's a nice sight.	Ukhamajj wali sumawa.
It was very early there.	Ukanx wali nayraw utjäna.
I know it’s weird.	Nayax yattwa ukax muspharkañawa.
He, for some reason, didn’t want to see me.	Jupax, kunatsa, janiw nayar uñjañ munkänti.
Why do I have to? 	¿Kunatsa nayajj?
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkäti.
There’s nothing like it here, really.	Janiw kunas akanx ukham utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
But he loved it.	Ukampis jupajj walpun munäna.

There’s nothing there.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkiti.
I look forward to seeing you again.	Jumanakar wasitat uñjañ suytʼaskta.

It got to the right place.	Ukaruw purinïna.
He sat there for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukan qontʼasïna.
What is it, he wondered.	¿Kunas ukajja, sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But tell him to do more.	Ukampis jukʼamp luram sasaw sañama.
And it still isn’t.	Ukat waliw jan ukhamäkiti.

That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw satawa.

He couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
He looks terrible.	Jupax wali axsarkañ uñnaqaniwa.
He said he immediately realized something was wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk jankʼakiw amuyasta sasaw säna.
I think about this.	Nayax aka tuqit amuyta.
But it wasn't the way he wanted to play today.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jichhürunakan anattʼañ munkäna ukhamäkänti.
And there was nothing.	Ukat janiw kunas utjkänti.
And there was absolutely nothing.	Ukat janipuniw kunas utjkänti.
And really, isn’t that what it’s about?.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ¿janit ukax uka tuqitxa?.
That makes them feel good.	Ukaw jupanakar sum jikjjatasi.

And, of course,.	Ukat, chiqpachansa,...
What happened next.	Kunas uka qhepat pasäna.
But everything he says is wrong.	Ukampis taqe kunatï siski ukajj janiw walïkiti.
I have no idea how to do this.	Kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janiw amuykti.
He said he could do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurasmati sasaw säna.
To be honest, I wasn't sure if that worked.	Chiqpachansa, ukax walikïskiti janicha uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
It’s a very good feeling.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
At the time, he said everything was fine.	Uka tiemponjja, taqe kunas walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
Yes.	Jïsa.
Well, it was very nice.	Ukhama, wali suma.
No one knows what happened there.	Ukan kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I don’t want to say anything.	Janiw nayax kuns sañ munkti.
I had no idea what the future held.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
There really is nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali askiwa.
You left him behind.	Jumaw jupar jaytawayta.
I know that's it.	Nayajj uk yattwa.
The timing is not right.	Uka tiempojj janiw walïkiti.
That is what that means to me.	Ukaw nayatakejj ukajj sañ muni.
It was a man .	Ukajj mä jaqënwa .
He refused to tell.	Jupajj janiw yatiyañ munkänti.
I asked him why.	Kunatsa uk jisktʼta.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurañ munkti.
It’s just for me.	Nayatakix ukhamakiw.
So I don't really know what he's doing.	Ukhamajj janiw kuntï luraski uk sum yatkti.
I’m looking forward to that.	Nayax uk suyt’twa.
In fact, you need both.	Chiqansa, panpachaniw munasispa.
It looks like that though.	Ukax ukham uñt’atawa ukampis.
I am however very disappointed.	Nayax ukampis wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I don’t think anyone did.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
It takes a person.	Mä jaqiruw munasi.
My last night.	Nayan qhipa arumax.
But now there is no time.	Ukampis jichhax janiw tiempox utjkiti.
Then he spoke again.	Ukat wasitatwa parläna.
He lived on his own.	Jupa pachpaw jakasïna.
But no, of course not.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He couldn't speak.	Jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
He thought it was a good idea.	Jupajj ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
But the problem is that you can do better.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
But then he wanted to be even more ambitious.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw jachʼa jachʼa tukuñ munäna.
And indeed it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
As we shall now do.	Kunjamtï jichhajj lurañäni ukhama.
It was all or nothing.	Ukajj taqe kunas jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.

Where it would be interesting though.	Kawkitsa wali askïspa ukampis.
But he did not know why he had left.	Ukampis kunatsa sarjjäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He decided to go back inside.	Jupajj wasitatwa utar mantañ amtäna.
I know that’s important to you.	Nayax yattwa ukax jumatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
It was a wicked man.	Ukajj mä jan wali jaqënwa.
But one is fine, of course.	Ukampis maynix walikïskiwa, chiqpachansa.
Actually, it worked for me.	Chiqansa, nayatakix wali askiwa.
Well, it’s really rare.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa juk’akiw utji.
That didn't tell him anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns jupar siskänti.
A few days later, the same thing happened.	Mä qhawqha urunak qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw pasäna.
But they don't know how to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ yatipkiti.
I was afraid that would happen.	Ukham pasañap ajjsarayäta.
So let’s do that first.	Ukhamajj nayraqat uk lurañäni.
About a couple of hours later.	Niya mä pä horanak qhepatjja.
That’s not at any time in the present.	Ukax janiw kuna pachas jichha pachanx utjkiti.
But don't do anything.	Ukampis jan kuns luramti.
That’s a tough one though.	Ukax mä ch’amawa ukampis.
There was not a moment.	Janiw mä jukʼa tiempos utjkänti.
I don’t think he likes it very much.	Nayax janiw juparux sinti gustkiti sasaw amuyta.
Very good indeed.	Wali suma chiqpachansa.
He must have wanted to go somewhere.	Kawkirus sarañ munpachäna.
He wanted both.	Jupajj panpachaniw munäna.
Nobody likes him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkiti.
It’s very rare.	Ukax wali juk’akiw utji.
There was no one there.	Ukanjja janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
I wanted to know what he was saying.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk yatiñwa munta.
There is nothing to do right now.	Jichhax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He saw the worst.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak uñjäna.
Every time there was something new, more energy.	Sapa kutiw machaq kunas utjäna, juk’amp ch’amaw utjäna.
That’s what’s doing it.	Ukaw uk luraski.
But, really, it’s wrong.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa, janiw walïkiti.
I don’t remember that.	Janiw nayax uk amtkti.
He was very surprised to see it.	Uk uñjasajj walpun muspharäna.
I don’t want to miss it.	Janiw ukanak jaytañ munkti.
You have told me.	Jumax nayaruw yatiyäta.
Tonight was that night.	Jichha arumax uka arumaw utjäna.
He knows this very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sum yati.
It’s much harder to do this.	Uka lurañax juk’amp ch’amawa.
He lived with her for about two years.	Jupajj niya pä maraw jupamp jakasïna.
But he knew a lot.	Ukampis jupajj walpun yatïna.
There is nothing but that.	Janiw kunas utjkiti jan ukasti ukakiw utji.
Anyone can do the work.	Khitis irnaqäw luraspa.
I’m going to go there.	Nayax ukaruw sarañ munta.
That did two things.	Ukaw pä lurañanak luräna.
He made a loud noise.	Jupajj mä jachʼa arunak luräna.
Everything is important.	Taqi kunas wali wakiskiriwa.
And they always do.	Ukat sapa kutiw ukham lurañ yatipxi.
As if one is saying the other can’t do it.	Maynix maynix janiw lurañjamäkiti sañ munkaspa ukhama.
So far too soon.	Jichhakamax wali jank’akiw.
I don't really know what's going on.	Kunas pasaski uk janiw sum yatkti.
I don't want to talk any more.	Janiw jukʼamp parlañ munkti.
He did not say when it would arrive.	Kuna horasas purini uk janiw siskänti.
He knows that I am sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
He will do very well.	Jupax wali sum lurani.
Except maybe one way, he says.	Jan ukasti inas mä tuqitxa, sasaw saraki.
He did both well.	Jupajj panpachaniw sum luräna.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
I didn’t do anything to them.	Janiw jupanakar kuns lurkti.
It’s not too bad.	Janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
So, this day has been wonderful.	Ukhama, aka urux wali sumaw utjawayi.
I was very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
It stayed that way for a long time.	Walja tiempow ukham qheparäna.
Not as much as it should be.	Janiw kunjamtï wakiski ukhamäkiti.
Now I want to speak up.	Jichhajj nayajj arsuñ munta.
I didn’t do that.	Janiw uk lurkti.
I didn't know it.	Janiw nayajj yatkayätti.
I thought he was a good guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa sasaw amuyasta.
In fact, it gets better.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp sumaw jikxatasi.
That’s kind of, the best part of it all.	Ukax mä juk’a, wali sumaw taqi kunat sipansa.
You're safe with me.	Jumax nayamp chikaw jan kuna jan walt'äwin jikxatastaxa.

Not much that he wants here.	Janiw walja kuntix jupax akan munkiti.
It’s really unique.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to do something.	Jupajj mä jukʼa lurañwa munäna.
I’d love to know more about it.	Nayax uka tuqit juk’amp yatxatañ munta.
I want to see what happens.	Kunas pasaski uk uñjañ munta.

He didn't understand what she was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk amuykänti.
He’s known all the time.	Jupax taqi pachan uñt’atawa.
They don’t know anything, really.	Jupanakax janiw kuns yatipkiti, chiqpachansa.
Don’t make it that weird.	Janiw ukham muspharkañ luramti.
It feels good to do so.	Ukham lurasajj sumwa jikjjatasi.
He enjoyed sleeping.	Jupajj ikiñan wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
You don’t want to say that.	Jumax janiw ukham sañ munktati.
He didn't understand.	Jupajj janiw amuykänti.
He knew something, but she didn't know anything for sure.	Jupajj kunsa yatïna, ukampis jupajj janiw kunsa sum yatkänti.
I like everything about the place.	Taqe kunas uka cheqan utjki ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.

And that’s what we need to do.	Ukat ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa sasaw amuyayäta.
Not right now, of course.	Janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
None of that was here.	Ukanakat janiw kunas akan utjkänti.
That’s not it.	Ukax janicha.
He walked more and more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw sarnaqäna.
So far, so good.	Jichhakamax, ukhama suma.

I love him, she thought.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
He said nothing about how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uka toqet janiw kuns siskänti.
Not anyone.	Janiw khitis.
So that's kind of nice.	Ukhamajj ukajj mä kasta sumawa.
He came at night.	Jupajj arumaw jutäna.
He knew there would be time for that.	Ukatakejj tiempow utjani sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.
Nothing needs to be done as it goes, really.	Janiw kuna lurañas kunjamtï saraski ukhamarjam lurañax wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
This can happen at night.	Ukajj arumaw utjaspa.
It’s funny though.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa ukampis.
You think about it.	Jumax uka tuqit amuyta.
I asked him what was wrong.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji sasaw jupar jisktʼta.
And another thing.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa.
He didn’t have that last year.	Jupax janiw ukax pasïr marax utjkänti.

Just as he had planned.	Kunjamtï jupajj amtkäna ukhama.

He could never see it.	Jupajj janipuniw ukanak uñjañ puedkänti.
I can’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurirjamäkti.
Well, a little bit.	Ukhama, mä juk’a.

But I want to know how to make one.	Ukampis kunjamsa mä lurañ yatiñ munta.
If anything happens, it does.	Kunas pasaspa ukhajja, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.

And then he called again.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa jawsäna.

Quite the opposite, he did it twice.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, pä kutiw ukham luräna.

Well, actually two.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa pä.
Someone wants to take it.	Maynix apsuñ muni.

Three weeks later.	Kimsa semana qhepatjja.
Someone was with him.	Maynix jupamp chikaw jikxatasïna.
This is really hard.	Chiqpachansa akax wali ch’amawa.
It really doesn’t mean anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munäna.
Of course, this is obvious.	Chiqansa, ukax qhanawa.
I want to do a lot of things.	Walja lurañanak lurañ munta.
You last time.	Jumax qhipa kutix.

I didn't quite understand what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
Just like you guys do.	Kunjamtï jumanakajj lurapkta ukhama.
That was what he wanted most.	Ukaw jupajj jukʼamp munäna.

I don’t know what else to say.	Janiw yaqha tuqit arsuñ yatkti.

And that is exactly what happened.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I don't know how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
I don't know what to do.	Janiw nayajj kunsa yatkti.
It doesn’t matter, really.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
So that's what's happening.	Ukhamajj ukajj kunatï pasaski ukawa.
It’s long and flat.	Ukax jach’a ukat ch’uqi satawa.
He hasn’t worked in two years.	Pä maraw jan irnaqkiti.
One thing for sure.	Mä kunaw chiqpachapuni.
So that's not a problem at all.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Of course.	Ukhamawa.
I’m very cautious.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw sarnaqañ yatta.
Let’s take a closer look.	Uk sum uñjañäni.
That’s a necessity.	Ukax mä wakiskiriwa.
I thought something bad had happened to him.	Mä jan waliw jupar pasäna sasaw amuyayäta.
I’m not quite sure how.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa uk sum yatkti.
I’m hoping that’s not the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suyt’askta.
He used to be like that.	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
I’ve never seen snow.	Janipuniw ch’uqi uñjkti.
He is himself again.	Jupa pachpaw wasitat utji.
Smaller people are better.	Jiskʼa jaqenakajj jukʼamp askiwa.
That means he’s doing something right.	Ukax jupax kuns sum luraski sañ muni.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj ukaruw wal munasïna.
That feels really bad.	Ukax chiqpachansa jan waliw jikxatasi.
I’ve said this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk arsuwayta.
Someone did it all.	Mayniw taqi ukanak luratayna.
He did intend to enter.	Jupajj cheqapuniw mantañ amtäna.
The box is very strong.	Ukaxa wali ch’amawa.
I don’t really want to talk to him.	Janiw jupamp parlañ wal munkti.
Nothing, really.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
So that's a good thing for me.	Ukhamajj ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
There is definitely a day.	Chiqpachansa mä uruw utji.
I don't care who did it, who did it.	Khitis uk luräna, khitis uk luräna uk janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkti.

I decided to pay the price.	Nayax uka qullqi churañ amtawayta.
That’s what they know best.	Ukaw jupanakax wali sum yatipxi.
He didn't know what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw yatkänti.
But there was nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
He refused to drive.	Jupajj janiw auto apnaqañ munkänti.
I went to school here.	Nayax akan yatiqañ utar sarawayta.
I needed it today.	Jichhüruw ukajj munasïna.
It needs to be done right.	Ukax chiqapar lurañaw wakisi.
Well, let’s see.	Ukhama, uñjañäni.
And I want to know why.	Ukat kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
I love this beer.	Nayax aka cerveza ukarux walpun munasta.
No, not at all.	Janiwa, janiw mayampsa.
This happened many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna.
For me, that says a lot.	Nayatakix ukax walpun arsu.
I really think he enjoys it.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi sasaw amuyta.
He hadn't done that in years.	Walja maranakaw jan ukham lurkänti.
They’re just not good enough.	Jupanakax ukhamakiw jan askïkiti.
I can't do as well as he does.	Nayajj janiw jupar uñtasit sum lurirjamäkti.
When did he do that.	¿Kunapachas ukham luratayna.
I won’t do anything about this.	Nayax janiw aka tuqitx kuns lurkäti.
It could be three days, even here.	Kimsa uruw utjaspa, akanx ukhamarakiw utjaspa.
And the man is fascinating.	Ukat uka jaqix wali muspharkañawa.
Now it is happening to him again.	Jichhajj wasitatwa jupar pasaski.
That doesn’t work here.	Ukax janiw akan irnaqkiti.

Of course it isn’t.	Chiqansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
This will be your year.	Akax jumanakan maraw utjani.

And I think he’s right.	Ukat nayax jupax chiqaw sasaw amuyta.

So much for that.	Ukhama ukat.

You mean well enough.	Jumax wali sum sañ munta.
He’s very bright.	Jupax wali qhanawa.

So he did what he had to do.	Ukatwa kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luräna.
At the time, it wasn't.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’s got to do it.	Jupax lurañapawa.
In fact.	Chiqansa.
He’s definitely going there.	Jupax chiqpachansa ukaruw saraski.
I miss you all day long.	Nayax taqi uruw jumarux walpun munasta.
But these things happened.	Ukampis ukanak lurañaw pasäna.
That is why he uses force.	Ukatwa chʼam apnaqi.
He didn't understand anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns amuykänti.
It’s the only one in town.	Uka sapakiw markanx sarnaqaski.
He was obviously devastated.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
But no one can do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkaspati.
I thought it was awesome.	Nayajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
And he can do that.	Ukat jupax ukham luraspawa.
Personally, I don't want that to happen.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham pasañap munkti.
You can’t do that.	Janiw ukax lurañjamäkiti.

Or you’re the one.	Jan ukax jumax.
You’re welcome.	Jumax wali askiwa.
But no one will do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkaniti.
But it’s not impossible.	Ukampis janiw jan kun lurañjamäkiti.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj uk walpun munasi.
At the moment, I am very happy.	Jichha tiemponjja, wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.

But he died twenty years ago.	Ukampis pä tunka mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
This is a guy who is a guy.	Aka jaqix jaqiwa.
Once last night, now again.	Mä kutix qhipa arumax, jichhax wasitat.

He refused to allow it.	Jupajj janiw uk permiso churañ munkänti.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Jupajj janiw kuntï luraskäna uk yatkänti.
Yeah, that was a thing.	Jïsa, ukajj mä kunaw utjäna.
Or make it your own.	Jan ukajj juma pachpa lurañamawa.

But the reality is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You don’t want to do that.	Jumax janiw uk lurañ munktati.

And it arrived early in the morning.	Ukat wali alwat purinïna.
I just left him alone.	Nayax juparux ukhamakiw jaytawayta.
Maybe you think something?.	Inas jumax kuns amuyta?.
Or better yet.	Jan ukax juk’amp askiwa.
It’s a little bit of everything.	Ukax mä juk’a taqi kunat uñt’atawa.
It’s also harder to do.	Ukhamaraki, lurañax juk’amp ch’amawa.
It started to rain heavily.	Wali jallu puriñ qalltäna.
It’s all yes or no.	Taqi kunas jïsa jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

You have no such future for yourself.	Jumax janiw ukham jutïr pachax jumatakix utjkiti.

But it all doesn’t matter.	Ukampis taqe kunas janiw kunäkisa.
It means what it means.	Kuntï sañ munki uk sañ muni.
Really, really bad.	Chiqpach, chiqpach jan wali.
Today he did something he had never done before.	Jichhürojj kuntï jan nayrajj lurkäna uk lurawayi.

Tell yourself you don't want that food.	Janiw uka manqʼa munkti sasaw juma pachpa sañama.

At the time, there was nowhere to go.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kawkirus sarañatak utjkänti.

Anyway, it doesn’t.	Kawkhansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

There isn’t.	Janiw utjkiti.
He didn’t quite say it yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax sum arskänti.
Because all the possibilities exist in the individual.	Kunatix taqi kunas utjaspa ukax sapa mayniw utji.

But there’s nothing to do here.	Ukampis aka chiqanx janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

And he took it out of it with great sadness.	Ukat wali llakitaw uka toqet apsüna.

But it is not necessary to do these things.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
That’s what we have to do.	Ukaw jiwasan lurañasa.

He wasn't sure how he was going to do it.	Kunjamsa uk lurani uk janiw sum yatkänti.

Not all people were there that day.	Janiw taqpach jaqinakax uka urux utjkänti.

What did that mean? 	¿Kunsa ukajj amuyasïna?
I have no idea what is outside that door.	Uka punku anqan kunas utji uk janiw amuykti.
Something that needs to be done.	Kunas uka lurañax wakisi.

Don’t do this to me.	Janiw nayat akham luramti.
That’s not good for you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.

But it was still beautiful.	Ukampis wali sumapunïnwa.

There was nothing he could do for me.	Janiw kunas jupajj nayatak lurañapatak utjkänti.

Not about that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa.

But they’re pretty obvious.	Ukampis jupanakax wali qhanaw uñjasi.

What is the value of the ? 	¿Kunas ukajja?
You don’t want any of that to happen.	Janiw kunas ukanak lurañap munktati.
Something is very wrong about this.	Kunas wali jan waliw aka tuqitxa.

But worse is yet to come.	Ukampis jukʼamp jan waliw jutani.

So he wanted evil.	Ukatwa jan walinak munäna.
But he couldn’t.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti.
That is not something you should do.	Ukajj janiw lurañamäkiti.

Of course, I don't want to do that.	Chiqansa, janiw uk lurañ munkti.

But how much money will it cost?.	Ukampis ¿qhawqha qollqsa munasini?.
These are not the case.	Ukanakajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or myself for that matter.	Jan ukax naya pachpaw uka tuqitxa.
He said he needed to do something worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisi sasaw säna.

But this is better for me.	Ukampis akax nayatakix jukʼamp askiwa.

He was so happy that he couldn't do it.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, janiw ukanak lurañ puedkänti.

But that still surprises me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
They like that a lot.	Jupanakajj ukham wal gusti.
But everything else, too.	Ukampis taqi kunas, ukhamaraki.

He thought she wanted him the way he did.	Jupajj kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamwa jupajj munäna sasaw amuyäna.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupaw uk luräna.
He gave it to me.	Jupajj nayaruw churitu.

He didn’t know when it was necessary.	Kunapachas wakisi uk janiw yatkänti.

But he didn't understand why this happened.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw amuykänti.
There was no reason for it.	Ukatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
And now here he came again.	Ukat jichhax akanx wasitat jutäna.

He didn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkänti.
Everything felt good.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw jikxatasïna.

And he stayed longer every day.	Ukat sapa uruw jukʼamp tiempo qheparäna.
But somehow he wasn't sure.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jupajj jan sum yatkänti.
But before that, there was nothing.	Ukampis janïr ukajj paskäna ukhajja, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He’s not going anywhere like that.	Jupax janiw kawkirus ukham sarkiti.
No one did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti.

Of course, there is nothing to do right now.	Chiqansa, jichhax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

In the morning it was money making.	Alwax qullqi lurañaw utjäna.
I don’t plan on driving.	Nayax janiw auto apnaqañ amtkti.

And that is the best part of it all.	Ukat ukax taqi kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.

This is clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanawa.

It didn't matter what he said to her.	Kuntï jupar siskäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
But he left the country.	Ukampis uka markat sarjjäna.

And where is it located.	Ukat kawkhansa utji.
Is that a good thing?.	¿Ukajj walikïskiti?.
Or so I thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyayäta.

He needs someone like you.	Jupajj jumar uñtasit khitirus munasi.

But, that doesn't matter.	Ukampis, ukajj janiw kunäkisa.

All of this happened a little bit.	Taqi ukanakax mä juk’a pasäna.
Or, somehow, it felt like one.	Jan ukajj, kunjamatsa, mä ukham amuyasïna.
He loved it here.	Jupajj akan wal munasïna.

There is nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
Well, that doesn’t work for me.	Ukhama, ukax nayatakix janiw askïkiti.

He could do much less now.	Jupajj jichhajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw luraspäna.
I don't know what he's going to do.	Kunsa jupajj lurani uk janiw yatkti.
He loves to do that too.	Jupajj ukham lurañ wal munaraki.
He’s a very bad guy.	Jupax wali jan wali jaqiwa.
Kind of like a car.	Mä juk’a auto ukhama.
It’s not what you think it is, he says.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti, sasaw saraki.

And he’s the one.	Ukat jupax.

He knew that was a good thing.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He didn't know much about her just yet.	Jupajj janiw jichhak jupat sum yatkänti.
These are the things he knew.	Ukanak yatïna.
I saw it twice the same day.	Uka pachpa urux pä kutiw uñjta.

He saw what he was saying.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna uk sum uñjäna.

This was not what he had planned.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj amtkäna ukhamäkänti.

But something strange happened.	Ukampis mä muspharkañ kunaw pasäna.

Every time he saw her he spoke badly of her.	Sapa kutiw jupar uñjasajj jan walinak jupat parläna.

Then he started playing himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw anattʼañ qalltäna.
I'm not sure how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw sum yatkti.

He wondered what had happened.	Kunas ukajj pasäna sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Of course, do this to no one.	Chiqansa, ukax jan khitirus lurañamawa.

He loved it so much.	Jupajj wal munäna.

Nothing more he could do, really.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp lurañ puedkänti, chiqpachansa.

How do you do it.	Kunjamsa jumax lurasma.
He has been waiting for a house for a long time now.	Jichhajj walja tiempow mä uta suytʼaski.
About a week later, he moved on.	Niya mä semana qhepatjja, yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.

This is one he said yes to and she said no.	Akax mä jupax jïsa sasaw säna ukat jupax janiw sasaw säna.

But he left every night.	Ukampis sapa arumaw sarxäna.

He never knew where he started.	Kawkitsa qalltäna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
The reason for this is as follows.	Kunatsa ukham lurañax wakisi ukax akham sañ muni.
That’s what lunch is all about.	Ukaw chika uru manq’añax utji.
That was the beginning of a wonderful career.	Ukaw mä suma irnaqäw qalltäna.

Very few of these were negative.	Ukanakat wali jukʼakiw jan walinak utjäna.

And then he talked more.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw parläna.
But after all, that doesn't matter.	Ukampis taqe kunat sipansa janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
You can find it here.	Ukax aka chiqan jikxatasi.
It’s a working day.	Ukax mä uruw irnaqañ urux utji.

He has to do it all himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe ukanak lurañapa.
That's not what I want.	Ukajj janiw nayajj munkti.
The reality here is the opposite.	Aka cheqan kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

I don’t think it gets better, and often worse.	Nayatakix janiw juk’amp askïkaspas ukhamäkiti, ukat walja kutix juk’amp jan waliw uñjasi.

No, that's not a good thing.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw walïkiti.

That’s good, of course.	Ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
This was clearly his intention.	Ukajj jupajj amtkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
So that was a painful experience.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
Well, that’s okay.	Ukhama, ukax walikïskiwa.
And that’s not the case.	Ukat ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

I don’t want to say anything about it.	Janiw nayax ukat kuns sañ munkti.
No one knew his real name.	Janiw khitis chiqpach sutip yatkänti.
The latter is rare.	Qhipa marax janiw sinti utjkiti.

He is a character.	Jupajj mä jaqewa.
I said it wasn’t.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw sista.

There’s really nothing you can do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But it's not the right thing to do.	Ukampis janiw ukajj walïkiti.
He was the first to see it.	Jupaw nayrïr kuti uñjäna.
No, he was making one himself.	Janiwa, jupa pachpaw mä luraskäna.
He was very affectionate.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
I did the same to her.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jupar lurawayta.
Nobody else is.	Janiw khitis yaqha tuqitxa.
Something is happening, happening.	Kunas pasaski, pasaski.
He did it on his own, without being told to do it.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna, janiw khitis uk lurañapatak siskänti.
He did a very good job.	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
I don't know how, but he is.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti, ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
That’s where it started.	Ukaw qalltäna.

He said it was good.	Jupax wali askiwa sasaw säna.
And then it happened beautifully.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wali sumaw pasäna.
He told her the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jupar säna.
In fact, you have to do that for about three years.	Chiqansa, niya kimsa maraw ukham lurañama.
I don’t believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw siskti.
That’s how it feels.	Ukax ukham jikxatasi.

There is everything there.	Ukanjja, taqe kunaw utji.

He knew why he had come.	Kunatsa jutäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He made sure he did it right.	Jupajj sum lurañapatakiw sum uñjäna.
I can’t remember his name now .	Jichhax janiw sutip amtaskti .
He went to the area.	Jupajj uka cheqar saräna.
I just can't agree with that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I think he was hungry.	Nayax amuyta, jupax manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
He was very happy to go.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw saräna.

It felt much better.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumaw jikjjatasïna.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
She wondered if he knew what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk yatpachati sasaw jisktʼasïna.
That was the last time.	Ukaw qhep qhepa tiempon utjäna.
That’s not good for anyone.	Ukax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
But tell me that.	Ukampis uk yatiyapxita.
Once, twice, three times.	Mä kuti, pä kuti, kimsa kuti.
He looked worried.	Jupax llakitaw uñnaqäna.
Therefore, he said.	Ukatwa ukham säna.
I’m really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He decided to take a chance.	Jupax mä ch’am apsuñ amtäna.

No one really knows what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti.

But there was nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañas utjkänti.
I don't know if that matters to you.	Nayajj janiw ukajj jumatak wakiskiti janicha uk yatkti.
But he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis parlañ wal munkänti.
I felt pretty good about it.	Nayax wali sum jikxatasiyäta.
What made it so.	Kunas ukham luräna.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk wal munäna.
He obviously enjoyed it.	Jupajj ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That seems to be a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
It doesn’t really mean it doesn’t.	Janiwa chiqpachansa janiwa sañ munkiti.
You don’t want to repeat it.	Janiw ukanak wasitat lurañ munktati.
But he has done just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw lurawayi.
He was already watching in the morning.	Jupajj niyaw alwajj uñchʼukiskäna.
So let’s do that.	Ukhamajj uk lurañäni.
It still doesn’t work.	Wali jan irnaqkiti.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurañ munkiti.
Let’s see that and.	Uk uñjañäni ukat.
It’s a slow motion.	Ukhama uñtatawa.
Maybe we will in the future.	Inas jutïrin ukham lurañäni.

But then he did a little better.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, mä jukʼa jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
He understood that.	Jupajj uk amuyäna.
But that's pretty weird.	Ukampis ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
But let me know.	Ukampis yatiyapjjeta.
He decided to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa amtäna.
I guess he didn’t know any better.	Nayax amuyta, jupax janiw juk’amp sum yatkänti.

Or so it seems.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyasi.

He walked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
And that's why he doesn't do anything better.	Ukat ukatwa janiw kuns jukʼamp sum lurkiti.
I asked him what he liked.	Kunas jupar gusti sasaw jisktʼta.
There was one first thing.	Mä nayrïr kunaw utjäna.

It took a long time to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj walja tiempow munasïna.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
Maybe he needs to go to one.	Inas jupax mä ukar sarañax wakischispa.
That's obvious.	Ukajj qhanawa.
This guy didn’t know anything.	Aka waynax janiw kuns yatkänti.
I don’t think he knows.	Nayax janiw jupax yatkaspa ukham amuyta.
But that’s good for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.

No one was saying that.	Janiw khitis ukham siskänti.

And it's never a bad thing.	Ukat jan walinak lurañajj janipuniw walïkiti.

Then he watched her closer.	Ukat jukʼamp sumwa uñchʼukiskäna.
In fact, everything is better for me now.	Chiqansa, jichhax taqi kunas nayatakix jukʼamp askiwa.
I don’t know what’s next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw yatkti.
But for me, it means much more than that.	Ukampis nayatakejj ukat sipansa jukʼampiw amuyasi.

I won’t repeat it here.	Nayax janiw akanx wasitat arsuñ munkti.

It was obvious that the man could not do much about it.	Uka jaqejj janiw uka toqet wal lurañ puedkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
And it looks really good looking.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.

He didn't want to leave his house.	Jupajj janiw utapat mistuñ munkänti.
He wanted to, yes.	Jupax munäna, jïsa.
I’m the only one who wants to get into it.	Naya sapakiw ukar mantañ munta.

But it doesn’t mean anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
It's an amazing thing that you can go through.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa, uka toqetwa jumajj pasaspa.
I thought it was really cool and really cool.	Chiqpachansa wali suma ukat chiqpachansa wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.

That’s all you need.	Ukakiw jumatakix wakisispa.
There’s nowhere this is going.	Janiw kawkirus ukax sarañapatak utjkiti.
You can't do it before or after that.	Uka nayrajj jan ukajj qhepat janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
But that doesn't make it worse.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
You guys are too!.	¡Jumanakax ukhamaraki!.
I see his every day.	Jupan sapa uru uñjta.
He reported that he was very happy.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi sasaw yatiyäna.

You have to work hard at it.	Uka chʼamampiw chʼamachasiñama.
The whole evening he never spoke.	Taqi uka jayp’ux janipuniw arskänti.
You have to do it yourself.	Juman pachpa lurañamawa.
There is no individual.	Janiw sapa maynix utjkiti.
So he threw it away.	Ukatwa jupajj jaqontäna.
I am well aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet sumwa yatta.
The answer is: .	Ukajj akham sañ muni: .
What did he decide to do?.	¿Kunsa jupajj amtäna?.
It came with me.	Ukajj nayamp chikaw jutäna.

He had no problem eating more, she thought.	Jupajj jukʼamp manqʼañatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
That will take some time.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow munasini.
But he knew all about it.	Ukampis jupajj taqe ukanak sum yatïna.
It won’t happen every day.	Janiw sapa urux ukham utjkaniti.
Nobody about that.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit.
He made a short film himself.	Jupa pachpaw mä jisk’a película luratayna.
This is obviously acceptable.	Uka lurañajj qhanaw walikïskiti.
But no, that's not right.	Ukampis janiw, ukajj janiw walïkiti.
This is important later.	Ukajj qhepat wali wakiskiriwa.
I love doing that, actually.	Nayax ukham lurañax walpun munta, chiqpachansa.
It’s so obvious about that.	Ukhama qhanaw uka tuqitxa.
He made her himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupar luratayna.
He says he won’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkäti sasaw saraki.
I was terrified that someone would come.	Mayniw jutani sasaw wal ajjsarayäta.
There is no one there.	Ukanjja janiw khitis utjkiti.
There was nothing for me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.
That was three years ago.	Ukajj kimsa mara nayraw pasäna.
He told me something.	Jupajj kuns sitäna.
A decade maybe.	Mä tunka mara inas.
He lives in a world of his own.	Jupa pachpaw mä pachan jakasi.
It will do the same for you.	Jumatakejj ukhamarakiw lurani.
He’s been there many times.	Jupax walja kutiw ukan jikxatasïna.
He refused again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jan munkänti.
I don’t think it really means that.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix uk sañ munkiti sasaw amuyta.
He lived alone.	Jupajj sapakiw jakasïna.
I saw it here, here, and here.	Nayax akan, akan, ukat akan uñjta.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit parlañ munkti.
I did my best.	Nayajj taqe chʼamampiw lurayäta.
These things can take time.	Ukanakajj tiempow munasispa.
Let’s see how it goes.	Kunjamsa saraski uk uñjañäni.

I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta.
A cold one beautiful.	Mä thaya mä suma.
And that is very important.	Ukat ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Or maybe it's just the wrong question.	Jan ukajj inas jan wali jisktʼajj wakischispa.
Someone was watching them.	Mayniw jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
You knew better.	Jumaw jukʼamp sum yatïna.
They are just .	Jupanakax ukhamakiw .
I love how it turned out.	Kunjamtï ukajj paskäna ukajj walpun munasta.
There’s still a chance for you.	Ukanx wali ch’amaw jumatakix utji.
So yeah, that's important.	Ukhamajj jïsa, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Really, really slowly.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa juk’ampi juk’ampi.
That’s exciting at this point.	Ukax aka pachanx wali kusiskañawa.
That’s a little bit.	Ukax mä juk’a.
Better than nothing, really.	Jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa, chiqpachansa.
Actually, I felt good.	Chiqansa, wali sumwa jikxatasiyäta.
I hope to see you soon.	Nayax jumanakar jank’ak uñjañ suyt’askta.
That’s what it’s supposed to do.	Ukaw lurañapa.
I didn’t have to do anything that night.	Uka arumax janiw kuns lurañax wakiskänti.
Whatever is happening.	Kunas kunas pasaski.
But he certainly did.	Ukampis cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
It was not a big deal.	Janiw mä jachʼa lurañajj utjkänti.
Tell us what it means to you and why.	Kunas jumatakix sañ muni ukat kunatsa uk yatiyapxita.
It will happen by itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw pasani.
Both are not very useful.	Panpachaniw jan sinti askïkiti.
Or one day at a time.	Jan ukajj mä uru.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj walpun munasi.
He was very happy for it.	Ukatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But, not really.	Ukampis, janiw chiqpachansa.
We will do the same thing.	Jiwasajj ukhamarakiw lurañäni.
I never wanted to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ munkayätti.
I think you’re more important.	Nayax amuyta, jumax juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
I’m saying that myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham sista.
There, it wasn't.	Ukanjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he was a nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali suma jaqënwa.
But these things are worth it.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj walikïskiwa.
This is not the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Always, this one time.	Sapa kuti, aka mä kutikiw.
But I don't want to make it any bigger than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa lurañ munkti.
He told me that.	Jupaw ukham sitäna.
He never did that.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurkänti.
I want more than that.	Nayax ukat juk’amp munta.
Well there never is.	Suma janipuniw kunas utjkiti.
But there was no time for that.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw tiempox utjkänti.
I think everyone knows that.	Nayax amuyta, taqiniw uk yatipxi.
This is actually not too bad.	Chiqansa akax janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
If you like it, great.	Jumatix munsta ukhaxa, wali sumawa.
Please tell us!.	¡Amukiw yatiyapxita!.
He knew why he didn't.	Kunatsa jan ukham lurkäna uk sum yatïna.
I’m doing it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham luraskta.
I stopped eating again.	Wasitat manq’añ jaytawayta.
It’s going to be a great night.	Ukax mä jach’a arumaw utjani.
In fact, that’s exactly what it did.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayi.
One doesn’t really need it.	Maynix janiw chiqpachansa ukax wakiskiti.
Or whatever it is.	Jan ukajj kunas ukajja.
I need to do that for me.	Nayatakix uk lurañaw wakisi.
I don't know what happened to that.	Ukajj kunas pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
I don't remember eating anything.	Janiw kuns manqʼañ amtaskti.
Language.	Aru.
I don’t know his name yet.	Janiw sutip jichhakamax yatkti.
Maybe you should do that.	Inas jumax ukham lurañama.
So, you know, that’s not good.	Ukhama, jumax yatisktawa, ukax janiw askïkiti.
I’m all alone here.	Nayax taqpach sapakiw akan jikxatastxa.
I want to get out of here.	Nayax aka chiqat mistuñ munta.
I don’t know what’s wrong with you.	Nayax janiw kunas jumatakix jan walïki uk yatkti.
Now that’s weird.	Jichhax ukax muspharkañawa.
This is really weird.	Akax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
Well, it’s awesome.	Ukhama, wali muspharkañawa.
There was never a problem.	Janipuniw mä jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
I really appreciate it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wali askit uñjta.
He really did like her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar uñtasit luräna.
I’ve only done this a few times.	Mä qawqha kutikiw uk lurawayta.
So, this isn’t really good.	Ukhama, akax janiw chiqpachans askïkiti.
I never wanted him to do that.	Janipuniw jupar ukham lurañap munkayätti.
We never had that.	Jiwasajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
But they’re good enough.	Ukampis jupanakax wali askiwa.
There’s a lot of snow.	Ukhama ukhamaraki.
We’ll see one like this.	Jiwasax mä ukham uñjañäni.
I don’t want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.
He’ll make a bed.	Jupax mä ikiñ lurani.
That doesn't do anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurkiti.

I can't say for sure.	Nayajj janiw sum sañjamäkiti.
Actually that’s pretty cool.	Chiqansa ukax wali sumawa.
You make every day, and everything, better.	Jumax sapa uru, ukat taqi kuna, juk’amp suma lurasma.
Everyone here knows that.	Aka chiqanx taqiniw uk yatipxi.
He spoke the words.	Jupaw uka arunak arsüna.
You have the time.	Jumax kuna pachas utji.
He said he never did.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
But they don't know what to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatipkiti.
How safe it is.	Kunjamsa jan kuna jan waltʼäwis utji.
So let's do something really great.	Ukhamajj mä cheqpach jachʼa lurañanak lurañäni.
Because they’re amazing.	Kunatix jupanakax muspharkañawa.
He’s a great guy.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa.
I am looking forward to that day.	Uka uru suytʼaskta.
But no one knew what to do.	Ukampis janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkänti.
So much faster.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw purini.
He doesn't think about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuykiti.
They don’t know yet.	Jupanakax janiw jichhakamax yatipkiti.
I am definitely going there.	Chiqpachansa ukaruw saraskta.
You’re a housewife.	Jumax uta jaqiwa.
So he does the most.	Ukhamajj jupaw jukʼamp luri.
He’s kind of a nice guy.	Jupax mä juk’a suma jaqiwa.
He’s a stranger.	Jupax mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
That’s how it should be done.	Ukhamaw lurañapa.
And then again the next day.	Ukat ukat qhipürux wasitatwa.
There was a time.	Mä tiempow utjäna.
I can’t stand something like that.	Nayax janiw ukham kuns aguantañjamäkiti.

He said it would take too long.	Ukat sinti tiempow munasini sasaw säna.
No one now knows why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw khitis jichhajj yatkiti.
Too bad good wine last night.	Sinti jan wali suma vino qhipa arumax.
And boy did he look bad.	Ukat waynax jan wali uñtasit luratayna.
It threw him off.	Ukajj jupar jaqontäna.
I don't want to live here anymore.	Janiw juk'ampi aka jakañ munkti.
He went back to his house.	Jupajj utaparuw kuttʼjjäna.

And he didn't know why.	Ukat kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkänti.
It’s a nice sight!.	¡Ukax wali sumawa!.
I wasn’t surprised.	Janiw muspharkayätti.
But there is more to where it came from.	Ukampis kawkhantï ukajj jutäna ukajj jukʼampiw utji.
Almost nothing can be done.	Niya janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
This season however.	Aka pachanx ukampis.
I didn't go to him.	Nayajj janiw jupan ukar sarkti.
That means something.	Ukax kuns sañ muni.
He looked happy for some reason.	Jupajj kunatsa kusisit uñnaqäna.
Please tell us more.	Jichhax juk’amp yatiyapxita.

I know it did that for me.	Nayatakix ukham luratayna uk yattwa.

Therefore, we.	Ukatwa, jiwasax.
All of this is important to me.	Taqe ukanakajj nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
Breakfast wasn’t worth the price.	Desayuno ukax janiw uka qullqix utjkänti.
He barely looked up.	Jupajj jukʼakiw uñchʼukiskäna.
I couldn't quite figure out what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.

He just did it that way.	Jupajj ukhamakiw ukham luräna.
I did it and it worked.	Nayax uk lurawayta ukat ukax wali askiwa.
Someone really has to do it.	Chiqpachansa maynix lurañapawa.
That’s a great beer to say the least.	Ukax mä jach’a cerveza sañ muni.
That takes some time, of course.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw munasispa, chiqpachansa.
I know he doesn’t.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t know you could do that.	Nayax janiw yatkayätti jumax ukham lurasma.

Very bad night as well.	Wali jan wali arumaw ukhamaraki.
You know what to do.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas lurañapa.

He is all inside.	Jupajj taqeniw manqhan utji.

How long did it take.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna.
It doesn’t mean there’s nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti sañ munkiti.
Well, it’s not.	Ukhama, janiwa.
He started to say something but didn’t.	Jupax kuns sañ qalltäna ukampis janiw arskänti.

Man he’s beautiful.	Jaqix jupax wali sumawa.
He does everything he says he will.	Kuntï siski uk taqe kunwa luraski.
I want to leave it at that.	Nayax ukham jaytañ munta.
He asked about you.	Jupajj jumat jisktʼäna.
Or you feel immediately.	Jan ukajj jankʼakiw jikjjatasta.
There’s a good feeling.	Ukanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Or longer time.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp tiempo.
I really don’t need this.	Chiqpachansa janiw akax wakiskiti.
I don't want to talk to you.	Janiw nayajj jumamp parlañ munkti.
It’s also a small.	Ukhamaraki mä jisk’a.
So there was nothing left.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He went to his house.	Jupajj utaparuw sarjjäna.
In this case, it still isn’t.	Uka tuqitxa, waliw jan ukhamäkiti.
He looks like someone else.	Jupax yaqha jaqir uñtatawa.
He didn't talk about it.	Janiw uka tuqitxa arskänti.
So it doesn’t exist yet.	Ukhamajj janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
You’re going to be very sad.	Jumax wali llakitaw jikxatasïta.
I don't want to stay here.	Janiw nayajj akan qheparañ munkti.

It gave me new life.	Ukaw machaq jakañ churitu.
I couldn’t wait to use it again.	Janiw wasitat apnaqañ suykayätti.
That’s what he did.	Ukjja jupaw luratayna.
But it’s really amazing.	Ukampis chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.

There was no time to do more.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañatakejj tiempojj utjkänti.

That's amazing to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
I went from the unknown to the familiar.	Nayax jan uñt’at chiqat uñt’at jaqiruw sarawayta.
I never wanted to go there in the first place.	Janipuniw nayrïr kutin ukar sarañ munkayätti.
I can't figure it out.	Janiw uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
And I doubt anything will come.	Ukat kunas jutani sasaw pächasta.
Anything that needs to be done once.	Kunas mä kutikiw lurañapa.
I didn’t want to stay home.	Janiw utan qhiparañ munkayätti.
He said he walked somewhere.	Jupax kawkhans sarnaqäna sasaw säna.
He never does that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
I don't want to leave him.	Nayajj janiw jupar jaytañ munkti.

That’s not what happens.	Ukax janiw kunatix luraski ukax ukhamäkiti.
I never did anything to him.	Janipuniw jupar kuns lurkti.
But this is not a necessary question.	Ukampis janiw uka jisktʼajj wakiskiti.
It took years to do this.	Uka lurañatakejj walja maranakaw munasïna.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Janiw kunas akan utjkänti, janiw kunas utjkänti.
Well, nothing right now.	Ukhama, janiw kunas jichhax utjkiti.
A school night.	Mä yatiqañ utan arumax.

This happened the other day.	Ukajj yaqha uruw pasäna.

Everything is like that.	Taqi kunas ukhamawa.
He saw the truth about himself.	Jupa pachpat kunatï cheqäki uk uñjäna.

Now it is time for me to say this.	Jichhajj nayajj akham sañ pachaw purini.
But that was even better for me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
That cannot happen here.	Ukajj janiw aka cheqan utjkaspati.

He didn’t mention it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit arskänti.
I have no idea what happened tonight.	Jichha arumax kunas pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
No breakfast for me.	Nayatakix janiw desayuno ukax utjkiti.
He’s an old school student.	Jupax nayra yatiqañ utan yatiqiriwa.
About that but I decided not to at the last minute.	Uka tuqitxa ukampis qhipa pachanx jan lurañ amtawayta.
All in all, it was a wonderful night.	Taqi kunat sipansa, uka arumax wali sumapunïnwa.
It is clear to me now.	Jichhajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasi.
There is something, that.	Kunas utji, ukax.

Thank you so much for that.	Ukatakejj walpun yuspärta.
Let’s see what it says.	Kuntï siski uk uñjañäni.
After that, I didn't know.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw uk yatkti.
There was something new.	Mä machaq kunaw utjäna.
No one said anything, he told himself.	Janiw khitis kuns arskänti, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.

No one knows anything.	Janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.

The point is, you don’t really want to do that.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañ munktati.
I didn’t expect it.	Janiw suykayätti.
You know what that is like.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk jumajj yatisktawa.

But I know one thing.	Ukampis mä toqetwa yatta.

Why, he walked more.	Kunatsa, jupax jukʼampiw sarnaqäna.
That’s one of those.	Ukax mä ukawa.
There was nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkänti.
No one could do anything else there.	Ukanjja, janiw khitis yaqha toqet kuns lurkaspänti.
He walked on his own.	Jupajj jupa pachpaw sarnaqäna.
There’s nothing left behind.	Janiw kunas qhipharux utjkiti.
They are absolutely nothing.	Jupanakajj janipuniw kunäkisa.

It’s big and beautiful.	Ukax jach’a ukat wali sumawa.
He didn't want to know that.	Jupajj janiw ukham yatiñ munkänti.
He had done it before and he could do it again.	Jupajj nayraw uk luratayna ukat wasitatwa luraspäna.
You have only one.	Jumax mä sapakiw jikxatastaxa.
But he seemed to have a look.	Ukampis jupajj mä uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
And his own.	Ukat jupan pachpa.

But this is the best.	Ukampis akax wali askiwa.
Instead, he said.	Jan ukasti, sasaw säna.
You’re so worried about it.	Jumax walpun llakista.
He did not say why he felt that way.	Kunatsa ukham amuyäna uk janiw siskänti.
Yes, it took two years.	Jïsa, pä maraw munasïna.
I think he meant it wasn’t.	Nayax amuyta, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sañ munäna.
He didn't want to do that.	Janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
I didn’t want one.	Janiw nayax mä munkayätti.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I don't want him to.	Nayajj janiw jupar munkti.
I never said ‘maybe’.	Janipuniw ‘inas’ sañ munkti.
You are completely alone.	Jumax taqpach sapakiw jikxatastaxa.

I didn’t want to use it.	Janiw uka apnaqañ munkayätti.
In this case he did not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukham lurkänti.
Why, there was something strange about him.	Kunatsa, jupat mä muspharkañ kunaw utjäna.
We’re both of us.	Panpachaniw jiwasax.

I realized he had done it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luratayna uk amuyayäta.
But that was a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.

You’re so surprised.	Jumax walpun muspharta.
He’s so happy he’s so happy.	Jupax wali kusisitaw wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.

But, you know, that’s okay.	Ukampis, jumax yatisktawa, ukax walikïskiwa.
There was nothing like it here.	Aka chiqanx janiw kunas ukham uñtasit utjkänti.

There was no one like that.	Janiw khitis ukham utjkänti.

That was doing them a lot of wrong.	Ukaw jupanakar wali jan walinak luraskäna.

And you’re going to have a lot of fun.	Ukat jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
But he couldn’t concentrate.	Ukampis janiw chuym churañ puedkänti.
It’s another .	Ukax yaqha .
That’s what he’s doing here.	Ukhamaw jupax akan luraski.
Do what he says.	Kuntï jupajj siski uk luram.
Something like this.	Kunas akham sañ muni.
In this case, it wasn’t.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He was just lying there.	Jupax ukhamakiw ikiskäna.
No, no, no, no.	Janiwa janiwa janiwa.

He told the whole truth, well.	Jupajj taqe kunatï cheqäki uk arsüna, sum arsüna.

And now I am.	Ukat jichhax naya.
This one does the job.	Aka mayniw uka lurañanak luraski.

Well, that’s good enough.	Ukhama, ukax wali askiwa.
I just decided to.	Nayax ukhamakiw amtawayta.
I built this house myself.	Naya pachpaw aka uta lurawayta.
He wanted to get out of there.	Jupax uka chiqat mistuñ munäna.
You have to work hard at it.	Ukatakejj wal chʼamachasiñama.
I’m not sure about that.	Uka tuqitx janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
I’m really looking forward to it all.	Chiqpachansa taqi ukanak lurañ suyt’askta.

Yeah, that’s exactly what he wanted.	Jïsa, ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munäna.
I don’t remember anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqit amtaskti.
I don’t know how to handle that kind of thing.	Nayax janiw kunjams uka kasta yänak apnaqañ yatkti.
On the other hand.	Yaqha tuqitxa.
I didn’t have to do a thing.	Janiw mä kun lurañas wakiskänti.

No one is going anywhere.	Janiw khitis kawkirus sarkiti.
But no one said anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
I like how it turned out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
And he’s moving fast, too.	Ukat jupax jank’akiw sarnaqäna, ukhamaraki.
He was in the house for an hour.	Jupax mä horaw uka utan jikxatasïna.
At the time, she was in love with him.	Uka tiemponjja, jupampiw munasïna.
I thought he was doing it all.	Jupaw taqe ukanak luraskäna sasaw amuyayäta.
All of these things were.	Taqe ukanakajj ukhamänwa.
He got what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk katoqäna.
I don’t think anyone can do it!.	¡Janiw khitis lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta!.
In fact, you can do it right now.	Chiqansa, jichhakiw uk lurasma.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
There are not that many people there.	Ukanjja, janiw ukham walja jaqenakajj utjkiti.
Something else needs to be done.	Yaqha lurañaw wakisi.
But, then .	Ukampis, ukat .
I told myself it didn’t matter.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti sasaw naya pachpa sista.
He’s with me now.	Jupax jichhax nayamp chikaw jikxatasi.

The question is not.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't like it very much.	Janiw nayarojj wal gustkituti.
It’s a good bit better now.	Jichhax mä suma juk’amp sumawa.
But he didn’t want to go out on his own.	Ukampis janiw jupa pachpa mistuñ munkänti.
There is no need to do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj wakiskiti.
This is not unusual.	Ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
That’s what I’m enjoying right now.	Ukax jichhax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.

It can’t be that.	Janiw ukax utjkaspati.
But he didn’t want to do that.	Ukampis jupax janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
And now this.	Ukat jichhax aka.
In fact, it appears that this is not the case.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
But she looks amazing.	Ukampis jupajj wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
She was looking at him.	Jupajj jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
He didn't say anything to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus kuns siskänti.
It's so obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanawa.
But for me, there is no such thing.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukham lurañajj utjkiti.
And it has nothing to do with anyone.	Ukat janiw khitimpis kuna lurañas utjkiti.
And he wanted to say a lot.	Ukat walpun arsuñ munäna.
Anyway, it doesn’t matter.	Kawkhansa, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
And so far, no one has.	Ukat jichhakamax janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati.
Let’s see what happens.	Kunas pasaski uk uñjañäni.
He didn't think it was worth it.	Jupajj janiw ukajj askïkaspas ukham amuykänti.
Of course, this was not the case.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
And the other way around, too.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
And do it for the first time.	Ukat nayrïr kutiw ukham lurañama.
He can do whatever he wants.	Jupajj kuntï munki uk luraspawa.
I want a guy to do that for me.	Mä waynax nayatakix ukham lurañap munta.
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurkänti.

It was the quickest way to do it.	Uk jankʼak lurañajj ukhamänwa.
But there was something about him.	Ukampis jupat kunas utjäna.
I still don't know much about him.	Jichhakamajj janiw jupat wal yatkti.
I can’t have this.	Nayax janiw akax utjkaspati.
You know the place serves lunch every day.	Jumax yatisktawa uka chiqanx sapa uruw chika uru manq’añax utji.
I want to live in that house.	Uka utan jakañ munta.
You say, that means everything to you.	Jumax satawa, ukax jumatakix taqi kunaw sañ muni.
He told us that.	Jupajj ukham sapjjetäna.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj walpun munasïna.
I never thought anything would come between us.	Janipuniw kunas nanakamp chika purini sasin amuyirïkti.
He stole books.	Jupajj libronak lunthatasïna.
They already know that.	Jupanakax niyaw uk yatipxi.
This is one of the most popular reasons.	Akax mä kunatsa wali uñt’atawa.
You don't have to go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarañajj wakiskiti.
No, he’s not like that.	Janiwa, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I would argue that it is not.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw arsuñ munta.
He would do anything for you.	Jupajj jumatakejj kunsa luraspänwa.
This is a great power.	Akax mä jach’a ch’amawa.

And that’s all good stuff.	Ukat ukax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I can't figure out why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
He doesn’t do anything.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkiti.
It’s still a popular one.	Wali uñt’atawa.
So very, thank you very much.	Ukhama wali, walpun yuspärta.
He did not know who moved first.	Khitis nayraqat yaqha cheqar sarjjäna uk janiw yatkänti.
It’s rarely impossible.	Ukax juk’akiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
We just have to do it.	Jiwasax ukhamakiw lurañasa.
And he wanted me.	Ukat jupajj nayaruw munäna.
I am so glad he did.	Ukham luratapat wal kusista.
You know the words.	Jumax uka arunak yatisktawa.
He had no idea how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw amuykänti.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis janiw jichha tiempon ukhamäkiti.
He knew how to do it before.	Kunjamtï nayrajj lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
Recognized language.	Uñt’at aru.
It feels bad for you.	Jumatakix jan waliw jikxatasi.
But there is nothing he can do about it.	Ukampis janiw kuns jupajj uka toqet lurkaspati.
Except that he was.	Jan ukasti jupajj ukhamänwa.
But thank you very politely.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw yuspärta.

He was a wonderful person to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali suma jaqënwa.

If you have a.	Ukax mä...
Let me know what you think.	Kuntï jumajj amuykta uk yatiyapjjeta.
I'm fine with that.	Nayajj ukajj walikïskiwa.
Now he felt like a different person.	Jichhajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
Everything went smoothly.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw saräna.
But it was a fun night.	Ukampis uka arumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He wasn’t, of course.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqpachansa.
He said it would take time.	Ukat tiempow munasini sasaw säna.
What is this happening.	Kunas akax utji.
Someone has to do it.	Maynix uk lurañapawa.
He’s excited about something.	Jupax kuna tuqitsa kusisitaw jikxatasi.
The new man is doing the same thing now.	Machaq jaqix jichhax ukham lurañanak luraski.
Of course,.	Ukhamawa,.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw uk amuyaskänti.
Something I have never done before.	Kuntï jan nayrajj lurawaykta ukajja.
I didn’t expect to see it again.	Janiw wasitat uñjañ suykayätti.

And this is amazing.	Ukat akax muspharkañawa.
And I know a lot about that.	Ukat uka toqet wal yatta.
And then that was it for me.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
But that’s all that ever happens.	Ukampis ukakiw kunapachas pasaspa.

But this is clearly not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
¡But it felt good!.	¡Ukampis wali sumaw jikxatasïna!.
I understand that well.	Uk sum amuyasta.
That’s exactly what he’s done.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax lurawayi.
But someone else was.	Ukampis yaqha jaqejj ukhamänwa.
I came here myself.	Naya pachpaw akan jutta.
I really didn't expect anyone to play.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis anattʼañ suykayätti.
Therefore ,	Ukhamajj .
I loved everything about this night.	Aka arumax taqi kuns walpun munasta.
I started taking pictures.	Nayax fotonak apsuñ qalltawayta.
He’s a financial force.	Jupax mä qullqi ch’amampiw irnaqäna.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
There’s so much more.	Ukhama juk’ampi.

No one will do the work for us.	Janiw khitis jiwasatak lurañanak lurkaniti.
That’s the guy.	Ukax uka waynawa.
There is definitely a ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ way to do it though.	Chiqpachansa mä ‘chiqa’ ukat ‘jan wali’ lurañaw utji ukampis.
Do it, stupid.	Uk luram, loqhe.
I mean something else.	Nayax yaqha tuqit sañ munta.

There is a coin.	Kuna qullqis utji.
I think she is very handsome.	Jupajj wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyta.

Well and more than that.	Suma ukat juk’ampi.
I don't want to talk about it much.	Janiw uka toqet wal parlañ munkti.
There is some truth to what he says.	Kuntï jupax siski ukax mä jukʼa chiqaw utji.
But I don’t understand that.	Ukampis janiw uk amuykti.
This time it’s slower.	Aka kutix juk’ampi juk’ampi.
He arrived a little early.	Jupajj mä jukʼa nayraw purinïna.
That or it’s a foreigner.	Ukax jan ukax yaqha markankir jaqiwa.
But for now, what you’re doing is good.	Ukampis jichhax kuntï lurapkta ukax wali askiwa.
The house is unique.	Uka utax jan uñt’atawa.
You’re right.	Jumax amuyta.
And that seems impossible.	Ukat ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
But he had died before.	Ukampis nayrajj ukhamarakiw jiwjjäna.
There, something happened.	Ukanjja, kunas pasäna.
He spoke very, very well.	Jupax wali, wali sum parläna.
That’s what he’s known for.	Ukax jupax ukham uñt’atawa.
That gave it to him.	Ukaw jupar churäna.
Everyone knows about you.	Taqinipuniw jumat yatipxi.
It was pretty much what he did.	Ukajj niya kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukhamänwa.
I never liked him.	Janipuniw jupar gustkituti.
I don’t want that to ever happen.	Janiw nayax ukham kunapachas pasañap munkti.
I didn’t want anyone.	Janiw khitirus munkayätti.
Of course, it wasn't what you thought it would be.	Chiqansa, janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkänti.
Now this is even more important .	Jichhax ukax juk'amp wakiskiriwa .
He could do no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp lurañ puedkänti.
Fortunately, this was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj wali askiwa.
The first time is good.	Nayrïr kutiw wali suma.

I really don’t like that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkti.
Maybe it’s going too far.	Inas sinti jaya sarañax wakischispa.
He’s making coffee.	Jupax café luraski.
And he didn’t do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurkänti.
The house means something to you.	Uka utax jumatakix mä kuns sañ muni.
I want to say that again.	Uk mayamp arsuñ munta.
It's coming to me.	Nayaruw purini.
I don’t know how to do this.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañax yatkti.
This is what got to me.	Akax nayaruw puri.
It was very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
That’s a good thing.	Ukax mä suma sañ muni.
He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa jupaw ukham luräna.
But there was one thing.	Ukampis mä kunaw utjäna.
I plan to do this every week.	Sapa semanaw ukanak lurañ amtasta.
But he didn't know everything.	Ukampis janiw taqe kun yatkänti.
It’s readily available.	Ukax jank’akiw jikxatasi.
It is, but it is not.	Ukhamawa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.

That happened a long time ago.	Ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
Just like you would at home.	Kunjamtï utan lurasma ukhama.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to say.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
What was he doing.	Kunsa jupajj luraskäna.
I don’t want to know.	Janiw yatiñ munkti.
I told him thirty.	Nayajj kimsa tunka sasaw jupar sista.
That’s what I did.	Ukhamaw lurawayta.
I don't know if he knows.	Jupajj yatpachati janicha uk janiw yatkti.
He’s going to need it wherever he goes.	Jupax kawkhantï saraski ukaruw ukax munasini.
That’s how it felt.	Ukhamaw ukham jikxatasïna.
Now everyone knows.	Jichhax taqiniw yatipxi.
Now let's see what I did.	Jichhajj kuntï lurawaykta uk uñjañäni.
That’s a fact of life.	Ukax mä chiqaw sañ muni.
But there was something.	Ukampis kunas utjäna.
He probably wanted better for you than he did.	Jupajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa jumatak munpachäna.
The man was right.	Uka jaqejj cheqapuniw säna.
Now this is a surprise.	Jichhax akax mä muspharkañawa.
The same living water.	Pachpa jakañ uma.
You are the best!.	¡Jumanakax wali askiwa!.
And that’s pretty common.	Ukat ukax wali uñt’atawa.
He loved to travel a lot.	Jupajj wal sarnaqañ wal munäna.
But it was really good.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
He did all of these things.	Jupaw taqe ukanak luräna.
But I didn’t want to go anywhere else.	Ukampis janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ munkayätti.
That’s what happened.	Ukaw pasäna.
I never believed them.	Janipuniw jupanakar creykti.

I had a lot of fun tonight.	Jichha arumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He spoke again.	Jupajj wasitatwa parläna.
He needs to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañaw wakisi.
I know that this is not really necessary.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun wakiskiti, uk sum yatta.
You can’t have all of that.	Janiw taqi ukanak utjkaspati.
What this means is that it is wrong.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munki ukajja, janiw walïkiti.
But he never said anything to her.	Ukampis janipuniw kuns jupar siskänti.
I think that’s a good thing.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.

You don’t have to make any stuff up.	Janiw kuna yänak lurañas wakiskiti.

This is not really the case.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
Lots of snowflakes.	Walja ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He left immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
He looks that bad.	Jupax ukham jan wali uñnaqaniwa.
He just said that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw säna.
I’ll take care of him.	Nayax jupar uñjañäni.
And he said so.	Ukat ukham säna.
I probably never will.	Inas janipuniw ukham lurkäti.

Which is kind of true, maybe.	Kuna kasta chiqa, inas.
And well, too.	Ukat suma, ukhamaraki.
I know how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
It’s really amazing.	Chiqpachansa, wali muspharkañawa.
He was sleeping little.	Jupax juk’a ikiskäna.
I didn’t know his name.	Janiw sutip yatkayätti.
I don’t think we’ll ever do that.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurañäni sasin amuyta.
This time it was silent.	Jichha kutix amukiw jikxatasïna.
How long it takes to do something else.	Yaqha tuqit lurañatakix qhawqha tiempos munasispa.
He’s really quite bright.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali qhanawa.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
It was quieter now.	Jichhax juk’amp amukiw jikxatasïna.
Three things are important.	Kimsa tuqitxa wali wakiskiriwa.
He knew why he was doing this.	Kunatsa ukham luraskäna uk sum yatïna.
At this point, he’s good.	Aka pachanx jupax wali askiwa.
Didn’t do it often.	Janiw sapa kuti lurañ yatkänti.
Something felt very wrong.	Kunas wali jan waliw amuyasïna.
Another way to put it is as follows.	Yaqha tuqitxa akham sañ muni.
So, so, so much.	Ukhama, ukhama, ukhama.
He looked strangely worried.	Jupax muspharkañ llakitaw uñnaqäna.
I think it looks really good so far.	Nayax amuyta chiqpachans jichhakamax wali suma uñtatawa.
So the issue is very important.	Ukhamajj uka jan waltʼäwejj wali wakiskiriwa.
He published a book of his own.	Jupa pachpaw mä libro apsüna.
I wanted something unusual but interesting.	Nayax mä jan uñt’at ukampis wali suma yänak munta.
Who was watching him.	Khitis jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I came to the same place.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jutta.
It doesn't take much time to react.	Janiw kuns lurañatakejj walja tiempojj wakiskiti.
It’s a little hard as well.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amawa ukhamaraki.
Of course, he didn’t know anything.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw kuns yatkänti.
The problem is rare.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj jukʼakiw utji.
But there is such a thing.	Ukampis ukham lurañaw utji.
A house, however.	Mä uta, ukampis.
Very little I notice.	Wali jukʼakiw amuyasta.
I think you will be very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta sasaw amuyta.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
He hit it off.	Jupax ukaruw ch’allt’äna.
But let’s see .	Ukampis uñjañäni .
Now  .	Jichha .
Younger is better.	Waynax juk’amp askiwa.
Much more negative.	Walja juk’ampi jan wali.
I don't know exactly what the problem is.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk sum yatkti.
I didn't know why it was happening.	Kunatsa ukham luraskäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
Time goes by and tomorrow is another day.	Pachax saraski ukat qharürux yaqha uruw saraski.
It’s really worth it.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
I think that’s good, actually.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
It's more important, you know.	Ukajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa, jumajj yatisktawa.
But above all else.	Ukampis taqi kunat sipansa.
But that doesn't matter today.	Ukampis janiw jichha tiempon ukajj kunäkisa.
You know what’s going to happen.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas pasani.
But so far nothing needs to be done.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
That’s the case with this.	Ukhamaw aka tuqitxa.
His perspective was rare.	Jupajj kunjamsa uñjäna ukajj janiw sinti utjkänti.
He said yes to it.	Jupajj jïsa sasaw säna.
I like how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
So there is no need to do these things.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
Maybe we’ll do that.	Inas ukham lurañäni.
You know, it was a little bit of both.	Jumax yatisktawa, mä juk’a panpachaniw utjäna.
And what is the value of it? 	Ukat ¿kunas ukajja?
I don't know how.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk yatkti.
That was the whole problem.	Ukaw taqe jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
It was never a secret.	Ukajj janipuniw jamasat lurkänti.
This is already old.	Akax niyaw nayrax.
And do what you want.	Ukat kuntï munkta uk luram.
I don’t want to go home.	Janiw utar sarañ munkti.
He didn't expect this.	Jupajj uk janiw suykayätti.
You can do it from anywhere.	Kawkitsa uk lurasma.
I feel like he is very old.	Wali chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
One never knows.	Maynix janipuniw yatkiti.
About him.	Jupa tuqitxa.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
And that’s what’s important.	Ukat ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
I want him to be there.	Nayajj jupar munta.
I tried to do too much.	Nayax sinti lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He saw the wind.	Jupajj thaya uñjäna.
Red, of course.	Wila, chiqpachansa.
He said it was really good.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw säna.
But he can’t have this.	Ukampis jupax janiw akax utjkaspati.
I’m looking forward to next summer for the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw jutir verano urun suyt’askta.
He took care of it.	Jupaw ukanak sum uñjäna.
Tell me where it is.	Kawkinkis uk yatiyapxita.
He was a different person.	Jupajj yaqha jaqënwa.
And it was a wonderful night.	Ukat wali suma arumaw utjäna.
I can do that, you know.	Nayax uk lurasmati, jumax yatisktawa.
You guys didn’t have this.	Jumanakax janiw akax utjkänti.
Far, far worse.	Jaya, juk’ampi jan wali.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkayätti.
I never saw the place.	Janipuniw uka cheq uñjkti.
I thought that was the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj ukham lurañaw wakisi sasaw amuyayäta.
What you are saying now.	Kuntï jichhajj siskta ukajja.
Where were they?.	¿Kawkinsa jupanakax utjäna?.
He said nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kuns arskänti.
I know everything you are saying.	Taqe kuntï jumajj siskta uk nayajj yattwa.
He was surprised to see her at the party.	Uka fiestan uñjasajj wal muspharäna.
I think they know that.	Nayax amuyta, jupanakax uk yatipxi.
It’s moving pretty fast.	Ukax wali jank’akiw sarnaqaski.
She said yes but no.	Jupajj jïsa ukampis janiw sasaw säna.
That was the case tonight.	Ukhamaw jichha arumax utjäna.
It could happen again soon.	Ukajj jankʼakiw wasitat pasaspa.
I’ve been saying this for years.	Nayax walja maranakaw ukham sista.
And beer, of course.	Ukat cerveza, chiqpachansa.
Warm and cool.	Junt’u ukat thaya.
Don't do anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqit kuns lurañamäkiti.
So he knew what he had to do next.	Ukhamajj kunas jutïrin lurañapa uk sum yatïna.
I did a lot of bad things.	Walja jan walinak lurawayta.
Someone will do the same.	Maynix ukhamarakiw lurani.
Find a spot for you.	Mä chiqaw jumatakix jikxatasi.
And one of a kind.	Ukat mä kasta.
But, he wants to talk a lot.	Ukampis, wal parltʼañ muni.
Not that it should be a bad thing.	Janiw ukajj jan walinak lurañapäkiti.
The facts do not matter.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I don’t think he means it, but he is.	Janiw nayax ukham sañ munkiti sasaw amuyta, ukampis jupax ukhamawa.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Walja tiempow jupar jan uñjkti.
Thank you very much.	Jumax walpun yuspärta.
I need to do it.	Nayax lurañaw wakisi.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamaw jupajj amuyäna.
I tell myself that every morning.	Sapa alwaw naya pachpajj ukham sista.
I’m a young man.	Nayax mä waynawa.
Of course, it can't last long.	Chiqansa, janiw jaya tiempox utjkaspati.
He didn't want to say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
Or many of them.	Jan ukajj walja.
It’s a difficult thing.	Ukax ch’amawa.
But it’s not, of course.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
More needs to be done.	Jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
He said he never did.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
He wanted better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa munäna.
He actually said that.	Chiqpachansa ukham säna.
I’m pretty good, actually.	Nayax wali sumawa, chiqpachansa.
That was about three years ago.	Ukajj niya kimsa mara nayraw pasäna.
It says everything about it.	Uka tuqitxa taqi kunwa arsu.
So for some reason.	Ukhama kunatsa.
It was after lunch.	Ukajj chika uru manqʼañ qhepatwa pasäna.
You say so yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham sista.
There is no one to go.	Janiw khitis sarañapatak utjkiti.
No one new anyone.	Janiw khitis machaq khitis.
I don't want to give that to anyone.	Nayajj janiw khitirus uk churañ munkti.
I refused to say yes to him.	Nayajj janiw jupar jïsa sañ munkti.
I’ve done that.	Nayaw ukham lurawayta.
I think it could be both.	Nayax amuyta, ukax panpachaniw utjaspa.
Two of these were the most surprising.	Ukanakat pä ukaw jukʼamp muspharäna.
I needed to do it faster.	Nayajj jukʼamp jankʼak lurañaw wakisïna.
I did it outside.	Nayax anqan lurawayta.
Nothing he won't do.	Janiw kunas jupajj jan lurkaniti.
I never knew how to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ yatkayätti.
Except that other time, two years ago.	Jan ukasti uka yaqha kuti, pä mara nayra.
I know what I mean.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk sum yatta.
But I still enjoyed it.	Ukampis wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Each and every morning.	Sapa ukat sapa alwaw.
What does it mean.	Kunas sañ muni.
He had made a bed before, she thought.	Jupax nayrax mä ikiñ luratayna, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Let’s see what happens.	Uk uñjañäni.
One person lives well, one person doesn’t.	Mä jaqix wali sum jakasi, mä jaqix janiw ukhamäkiti.
No it’s not like that.	Janiwa janiw ukhamäkiti.
Nothing and no one.	Janiw kunas ni khitis.
So, this goes to bed.	Ukhama, akax ikiñar saraski.
Of course there isn’t really anything.	Chiqansa janiw chiqpachansa kunas utjkiti.
I think it’s better.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juk’amp askiwa.
I’ve done that.	Nayax ukham lurawayta.
It doesn't matter.	Janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
It all happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw pasäna.
A school of thought.	Mä yatiqañ uta.
There’s no money in it.	Ukanx janiw qullqix utjkiti.
I don’t want to be alone.	Janiw nayax munkti.
And why should you!.	¡Ukat kunatsa ukham lurañama!.
And blood, so much blood.	Ukat wila, ukhama walja wila.
I’m starting to struggle.	Nayax ch’am tukuñ qalltawayta.
That’s rarely the case.	Ukax juk’akiw ukhama.
It happened all the time.	Ukajj sapa kutiw pasäna.
I’ve done something.	Nayax kuns lurawayta.
I really don’t know what’s wrong with me.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas nayar pasaski uk yatkti.
But it’s not entirely true.	Ukampis janiw taqpach chiqaw sañ munkiti.
He told me everything, really everything.	Jupax taqi kuns yatiyäna, chiqpachapuniw taqi kuns yatiyäna.
It was immediately available.	Ukajj jankʼakiw utjäna.
He did everything so well.	Jupajj taqe kunsa wali sumwa luräna.
He is a teacher.	Jupax yatichiriwa.
But, isn't it?'	Ukampis, ¿janich ukhamäki?’ sasa.
But she wanted him as much as he wanted her.	Ukampis kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamarakiw jupar munäna.
He knew it once and for all.	Jupajj mä kutikiw uk yatïna.
So it doesn't exist for me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayatakejj utjkiti.
Why, he didn’t know.	Kunatsa, jupax janiw yatkänti.
But this one did that.	Ukampis akax ukham luräna.
Don't miss it!.	¡Janiw ukanak jaytañamäkiti!.
She needs a good husband.	Jupajj mä suma chacharuw munasi.
I have something important.	Nayax kunas wali wakiskiriwa.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Janiw jichhax, inas jan juk’ampi.
I can hardly agree.	Nayajj wali chʼamampiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I don’t see it.	Janiw uñjkti.
I’ve done something else.	Nayax yaqha lurawayta.
I thought that was a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
But that rarely happened.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼakiw pasäna.
I'm doing really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa luraskta.
It really started.	Chiqpachansa qalltäna.
I have the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw utjitu.
He is nothing at all.	Jupajj janiw kunäkisa.
I started to see it.	Nayax uñjañ qalltawayta.
That’s not necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti.
As it is the case.	Kunjamtï ukhamäki ukhama.
Now do it again.	Jichhax mayamp luram.
He wanted more, and more came.	Jukʼamp munäna, ukat jukʼampiw jutäna.
I thought something was wrong with him.	Jupat kunas janiw walïkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
So you don't want to know.	Ukhamajj janiw yatiñ munktati.
That was not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m happy to do it.	Uk lurañax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I never really found a good use for it.	Janipuniw chiqpachansa ukatakix mä suma apnaqañ jikxatkti.
But I can't figure it out.	Ukampis janiw uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
Then he started taking pictures.	Ukat fotonak apsuñ qalltäna.
So obviously that's not enough.	Ukhamajj qhanaw ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
Why does he .	Kunatsa jupajj .
But it's not what you think it is.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhamäkiti.
It called to him two years ago.	Ukajj pä mara nayraw jupar jawsäna.
You’re welcome to this.	Jumax akax wali askiwa.
A new year.	Mä machaq mara.
There are no people.	Janiw jaqinakax utjkiti.
And that’s a lot of fun.	Ukat ukax wali kusiskañawa.
Most of all, I am very happy.	Taqe kunat sipansa wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.

I don't know at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa yatkti.
Not like anything matters.	Janiw kunjamtï kunas wakiski ukhama.
He loves everyone.	Jupax taqiniruw munasi.
Or you're the one.	Jan ukajj jumajj.
He’s a great guy, very nice guy.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa, wali suma jaqiwa.
That’s not the case here, he says.	Aka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupax saraki.
A couple of times like that, actually.	Mä pä kuti ukhama, chiqpachansa.
That’s not the right thing to do.	Ukax janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
I saw something that could not exist.	Kunatï jan utjkaspati uk uñjta.
I went to see it last night.	Nayax qhipa arumaw uñjir sarawayta.
So he refused to drink.	Ukatwa jan umañ munkänti.
I’ve been successful for twenty years.	Nayax pä tunk maraw suma jikxatastxa.
He was watching her intently.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.

But there is no reason.	Ukampis janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.

He has done it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham lurawayi.
What happened to us meant nothing.	Kunatï nanakamp paskäna ukajj janiw kunsa sañ munkänti.
Now, it’s time for me to say goodnight to everyone.	Jichhax, nayatakix taqiniruw suma arumax sañ pachaw purini.

And something is better than nothing.	Ukat kunas jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.

But he could have done that anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham luraspäna.
In fact, he was very quiet.	Chiqansa, jupax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
But then there was none.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw utjkänti.

I don’t like making a film like that.	Ukham película lurañax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
He was very happy to see her.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jupar uñjäna.
He does a lot of stuff like that.	Jupax ukham lurañanak walpun luraski.
And his alone.	Ukat jupan sapaki.
But he himself knew nothing of it.	Ukampis jupa pachpajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.

Of course you know that.	Chiqpachansa jumax uk yatisktawa.

So in a way, yes.	Ukhamajj mä tuqitxa, jïsa.
He was the first to see blood.	Jupaw nayraqat wila uñjäna.
I really don't want to talk about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit parltʼañ munkti.
He wouldn't have done that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkaspänti.
He does this every year.	Jupax sapa maraw ukham luraski.
That meant a lot.	Ukajj walpun sañ munäna.
I don’t see what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw uñjkti.

That would be really good.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askïspawa.
He’s the one who knows everything.	Jupaw taqe kun yati.

Such a great book.	Ukham jach’a libro.

He never knew before.	Janipuniw nayrajj yatkänti.
It doesn’t do many bad things.	Janiw walja jan walinak lurkiti.
I know what you’re capable of.	Nayax yattwa kuntix jumax lurañ yatkta ukxa.
He didn't have that in him.	Jupajj janiw ukajj jupan utjkänti.
Where appropriate, speed up.	Kawkhantï wakiski ukanjja, jankʼakiw lurañama.
I have done so much.	Nayajj walpun lurawayta.
I was so happy today.	Jichhürunakanxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
No one wants to.	Janiw khitis munkiti.
I told him last year and the year before.	Nayax juparux pasïr mara ukat nayrïr maraw ukham sista.
I don’t really do that.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix ukham lurkti.
Great day.	Jach’a uru.
It happened a few times.	Mä qhawqha kutiw ukham pasäna.
And we will do it soon.	Ukat jankʼakiw uk lurañäni.
I really want to know.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw yatiñ munta.
Never, really.	Janipuniw kunapachas, chiqpachansa.
He was such a nice guy.	Jupajj ukham suma jaqënwa.
He seemed to know exactly what he had to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He was even more surprised.	Jupajj jukʼampiw muspharäna.
It actually kind of happened, actually.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa ukham pasäna, chiqpachansa.
I don’t think he ever did.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
It requires action.	Ukatakejj lurañaw wakisi.
But it needs to be done!.	Ukampis ¡ukajj lurañaw wakisi!.
Of course, he wasn’t.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I love the city.	Nayax markarux walpun munasta.
It was a separate one.	Ukajj sapa mayniw utjäna.
But then something happened to her.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunas jupar pasäna.
It just happened to be.	Ukhamakiw pasäna.
Let me know if you think it’s funny!.	¡Jumax wali kusiskañawa sasin amuyta ukhax yatiyapxita!.
I think he can do it.	Nayax amuyta, jupax luraspawa.
He told them everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupanakar yatiyäna.
He did nothing to prevent it.	Uka jan lurañatakejj janiw kuns lurkänti.
There is no such school.	Janiw ukham yatiqañ utax utjkiti.
I’m sorry, he said.	Nayax llakistwa, sasaw säna.
He really knows what he’s doing.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw kuntï luraski uk sum yati.
There is no .	Ukax mä .
It’s like that.	Ukhama ukhama.
I thanked him for doing so.	Ukham luratapat jupar yuspärta.
The future is not like that.	Jutïr tiempojj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You’re a great guy.	Jumax wali jach’a jaqïtawa.
He’s a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
The next day he moved.	Qhipürux yaqha chiqar sarxäna.
A first, he said.	Mä nayrïr, sasaw jupajj säna.
That’s what he expected to happen.	Ukaw pasañap suyäna.
This can happen early in the morning or late at night.	Ukajj wali alwat jan ukajj wali arumaw pasaspa.
Not the other way around.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
It never goes anywhere.	Janipuniw kawkirus sarkiti.
He knows what happened.	Jupajj kunas pasäna uk sum yati.
In fact, we were.	Chiqpachansa, jiwasax ukhamänwa.
A lot actually.	Walja chiqpachansa.
I promised him a warm bed.	Nayax juparux mä junt’u ikiñ arsuwayta.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I am so worried about you guys.	Nayajj jumanakat wal llakista.
He wanted her so badly.	Juparux wali ch’amampiw munäna.
It’s not a fact.	Janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
Do whatever you want.	Kunjamtï munkta ukham luram.
I don’t want to say anything.	Nayax janiw kuns sañ munkti.
A lot, but not really.	Walja, ukampis janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
I didn't want to.	Nayajj janiw munkayätti.
How was the question.	Kunjamsa uka jisktʼajj utjäna.

Here, he’s never done this before.	Akax, jupax janipuniw nayrax ukham lurkänti.
I don’t really know.	Janiw chiqpachapuni yatkti.
He had no idea what he could do about it.	Jupajj janiw kunsa uka toqet luraspa uk amuykänti.
He would do it later in bed.	Jupajj ikiñan qhepatwa ukham luraspäna.
I had no idea if that was right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw amuykayätti.
I’ve had a hard time with that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali ch’amaw jikxatasiyäta.
It’s been a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.
He left later.	Jupajj qhepatwa sarjjäna.
I’m definitely .	Nayax chiqpachapuniw .
Maybe it’s the same.	Inas ukhamaraki.
This day, one wasn’t.	Aka urux, maynix janiw ukhamäkänti.
This may take some time.	Ukatakejj mä qhawqha tiempow munasispa.
I don't know why.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkti.
I didn't need it.	Nayajj janiw wakiskänti.
That's how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
I like to do that myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
I’ve seen that a lot.	Nayax ukham wal uñjta.
I just can't bear to see you.	Nayajj janiw jumar uñjasajj aguantañjamäkiti.
You have to work hard every day.	Sapa uruw chʼamachasiñama.
I don’t want to see it.	Janiw uñjañ munkti.
But then it happened to me.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, nayaruw pasäna.
I mean really good.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa sañ munta.
The weather is very strong.	Pachax wali ch’amawa.
And he wanted me.	Ukat jupax nayaruw munäna.
Maybe three times.	Inas kimsa kuti.
But he didn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw munkänti.
I didn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkti.
I don’t need to do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
I think that’s really cool.	Nayax amuyta ukax chiqpachans wali sumawa.
That’s too far for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali jaya.
A lovely house.	Mä munat uta.
That’s exactly what’s happening here.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw akanx utji.
That's how I feel.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta.
I didn't quite understand that.	Ukjja janiw sum amuykayätti.
And as he says.	Ukat kunjamtï jupax siski ukhama.
But in the end, it doesn't matter.	Ukampis qhepatjja, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
One way or the other, it doesn’t matter.	Mä tuqitxa jan ukax yaqha tuqitxa, janiw kunäkisa.
It was a human being.	Ukajj mä jaqënwa.
He wanted more, more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw munäna, jukʼampiw munäna.
See here, and here, and here.	Aka chiqan uñjañäni, ukat akan uñjañäni, ukat akan uñjañäni.
It’s almost amazing.	Niya muspharkañawa.
He didn't want to, she thought.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
And that makes sense to me.	Ukat ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis uk janiw lurkänti.
I promised he was fine.	Nayax jupax walikïskiwa sasaw arsuwayta.
I’ve done it.	Nayax uk lurawayta.
I want to see it for myself.	Naya pachpaw uñjañ munta.
You look so cute.	Jumax wali munat uñnaqaniwa.
Not to anyone for any reason.	Janiw khitirus kunatsa.
He gave me money.	Jupajj qollqe churitu.
Tell me what you want.	Kuntï munkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
I didn’t really know how to pull it off.	Janiw chiqpachapunix kunjams apsuñ yatkayätti.
He’s doing great right now.	Jupax jichhax wali sum luraski.
But that's good for you.	Ukampis ukajj jumatakix wali askiwa.
And there is nothing.	Ukat janiw kunas utjkiti.
And then something happened.	Ukat ukat kunas pasäna.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
A red rainbow.	Mä wila jallu.
It’s good this is good for you.	Ukax wali askiwa akax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I like it here.	Nayax akanx wali askiwa.
He was nobody.	Jupajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
Now it’s time to leave.	Jichhax sarxañ pachaw purini.
He moved very, very fast.	Jupax wali, wali jank’akiw sarnaqäna.
And even bigger.	Ukat jukʼamp jachʼa.
I really mean that too.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukhamarakiw sañ munta.
Really, really harsh.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa qhuru.
Let’s do it that day.	Uka urux lurañäni.
I agree with that.	Nayajj ukaruw iyaw sista.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw jupajj säna.
Of course, he didn't say that.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham siskänti.
Really, really fast.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali jaya.
He’s the one who lives it.	Jupaw ukham jakasi.
He means too much.	Jupax sinti sañ muni.
And whenever.	Ukat kunapachas.
I was surprised.	Nayajj wal muspharta.
It’s not really bad.	Janiw chiqpachapuni jan walïkiti.
He can’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukax lurañjamäkiti.
Where are they ever ?.	Kawkhansa jupanakax kunapachas ?.
Let me know how you like them.	Kunjamsa jupanakar gusti uk yatiyapxita.
I’m really excited, actually.	Nayax chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
He’s definitely here.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw aka chiqan utji.
So much for the other side.	Ukhama yaqha tuqitxa.
We will definitely do that.	Chiqpachapuniw ukham lurañäni.
A long time ago .	Walja tiempo nayrajj .
Everything was twice.	Taqi kunas pä kutiw utjäna.
So that’s why it’s there.	Ukhamajj ukatwa ukan utji.
No, not really.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa.
I am not sure why.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkti.
He was really cute.	Jupajj cheqapuniw wali munasïna.
That’s how things worked.	Ukhamaw kunas irnaqäna.
I’m going now.	Nayax jichhax saraskta.
I don't know where that came from, but he was.	Ukajj kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw yatkti, ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa.
And he’s very successful.	Ukat jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
That’s good, that’s good.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax wali askiwa.
A bad place to be.	Mä jan wali chiqa.
This is so quick.	Akax ukhama jank’akiw.
So it happened later.	Ukhamajj qhepatwa ukajj pasäna.
That seemed like a good fit to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I thought that was amazing.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
He’s definitely going to do something else at some point.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw mä juk’a pachax yaqha lurañ amti.
He didn't talk about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw arskänti.
He told me he didn't want to pay.	Jupajj janiw qollqe churañ munkti sasaw sitäna.
After that year.	Uka mara qhepatjja.
I mean the whole thing.	Nayax taqpach sañ munta.
They’re okay.	Jupanakax walikïskiwa.
He just fell asleep.	Jupajj ukhamakiw ikiñar jaqontäna.
I just thought it was.	Nayax ukhamakiw amuyayäta.
This week and next week.	Aka semana ukat jutir semana.
But he knows one thing.	Ukampis jupajj mä toqetwa yati.
Here’s what’s so funny.	Akax kunatix wali muspharkañawa.
You have to do the work.	Jumaw lurañanak lurañama.
But I'm not.	Ukampis nayajj.
I don't think that's necessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw nayajj amuyta.
I never said no.	Janipuniw janiw sasaw siskti.
Everyone knows the truth.	Sapa mayniw kunatï cheqäki uk sum yati.
What is he doing now? 	¿Kunsa jichhajj luraski?
I really had no choice.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
So it's a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askiwa.

Well, this is it.	Ukhama, akax ukhamawa.
I am more than happy to help.	Nayajj yanaptʼañatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
It’s actually very difficult.	Chiqansa wali ch’amawa.
Or the car.	Jan ukax auto.
He’s straight up nice, too.	Jupax chiqaw wali suma, ukhamaraki.
I really appreciate it.	Chiqpachansa wali askit uñjta.
I don’t think it’s right.	Nayatakix janiw walïkiti.
But that’s good enough for now.	Ukampis ukax jichhax wali askiwa.
Well, yes and no.	Ukhama, jïsa ukat janiw.
But he was still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I have done this for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham lurawayta.
This is another person.	Akax yaqha jaqiwa.
Do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham luram.
But that really doesn’t mean much.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax janiw sinti sañ munkiti.
You know what time it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kuna pachas.

I’m glad it’s more and better for it.	Nayax kusisitaw ukat juk’ampi ukat ukatakix juk’amp askiwa.
But I love it so much.	Ukampis nayajj walpun munasta.
He didn't know for sure himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw sum yatkänti.
It went on for hours.	Walja horanakaw ukham sarnaqäna.
What you have done is wrong.	Kuntï lurawaykta ukajj janiw walïkiti.
He has given it up.	Jupajj uk jaytawayi.
After all, because it’s impossible.	Taqi kunat sipansa, kunatix janiw lurañjamäkiti.

He hit it too hard, he knew.	Jupax sinti ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna, uk yatïna.
But of course you should.	Ukampis chiqpachansa jumax ukham lurañamawa.
No action is required in this regard at this time.	Aka pachanx janiw kuna lurañas uka tuqitx wakiskiti.
When you do that.	Kunapachatï ukham lurapkta ukhajja.

But that's okay .	Ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa .
I’m sure it’s him.	Nayax jupaw sasaw yatxatasta.
So far, no one has done so.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.

There is no real world.	Janiw chiqpach pachax utjkiti.
He doesn't want to come.	Jupajj janiw jutañ munkiti.
There was never a local.	Janipuniw uka markankir jaqejj utjkänti.
All of this will take time.	Taqi ukanakax tiempow munasini.
I’ve been doing this for a couple of years.	Mä pä maraw ukham luraskta.

He just felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamakiw ukham jikjjatasïna.
Sorry, no sorry.	Perdón, janiw perdón.
There is nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
Someone wanted to know something.	Mayniw kuns yatiñ munäna.
I can't quite figure out what the problem might be.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
I’m looking forward to this a lot.	Nayax aka tuqitx walpun suyt’askta.

That’s not what it needs to be.	Ukax janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He wanted to make this film.	Jupax aka película lurañ munäna.
Because he’s a bad guy.	Kunatix jupax jan wali jaqiwa.
These are the	Ukanakax .
I remember that more.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼampiw amtasta.
He thanked me sincerely.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw yuspärta.

But I don't know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkti.

I understand him well enough.	Nayax juparux sum amuyta.
I would never do that again.	Nayajj janiw mayampsa ukham lurañ munkti.

This is an important part of helping them.	Ukajj jupanakar yanaptʼañatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
Really, really bad.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jan wali.
If you want to leave it at that, that’s fine.	Ukham jaytañ munsta ukhaxa, walikïskiwa.
He doesn't like the question.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw jupar gustkiti.
I can’t say for sure yet.	Janiw jichhakamax chiqpachapunix siskti.
He had no idea what had happened to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna uk janiw kuns yatkänti.
Someone did that for me a long time ago.	Maynix nayatakix nayratpachaw ukham luratayna.
And he is doing it.	Ukat jupaw uk luraski.
But he didn’t really say no.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachapunix janiw sasaw siskänti.
That’s a great character.	Ukax mä jach’a jaqiwa.
He remained there silently.	Jupajj ukan amukiw qheparäna.
You’re the one about it.	Jumax uka tuqitxa.
I would need that kind of help.	Nayajj ukham yanaptʼa munasispa.

Much earlier.	Walja nayra.
There was nothing more to do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkänti.
Now that doesn't matter.	Jichhajj janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
He wouldn't have done that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkaspänti.
This means two things.	Ukax pä tuqit sañ muni.
But there was no time.	Ukampis janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
But he wanted to know.	Ukampis yatiñwa munäna.
I see what you’re doing.	Nayax kuntix lurapkta uk uñjta.

And boy did he do it beautifully.	Ukat waynax wali sumaw luratayna.

In fact, that’s exactly what happens.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.

Never forget that.	Ukjja janipuniw armasimti.
I didn’t do such a good job on him.	Nayax janiw jupar ukham suma irnaqäw lurkti.
It is good when someone wants to help.	Kunapachatï maynix yanaptʼañ munki ukhaxa wali askiwa.
I don’t want to see what’s out there.	Janiw kunas uka chiqan utjki uk uñjañ munkti.
I can’t believe otherwise.	Janiw yaqha tuqit iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But he was, and always will be.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa, ukhamarakiw utjani.
Don't forget that.	Uk jan armasimti.
That’s not the case there.	Uka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkiti.
And you have to work hard to do it.	Ukat uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
Or so he thinks.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyi.
He didn't know what he meant.	Jupajj kunsa sañ munäna uk janiw yatkänti.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Ukax qhanaw jan irnaqkiti.
You know, it’s tough at this point.	Jumax yatisktawa, aka pachanx wali ch’amawa.
I felt bad about it.	Uka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatasiyäta.
He didn't want to come.	Jupajj janiw jutañ munkänti.
I had no problem with any of these.	Ukanakat janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkitänti.
Something felt like that.	Kunas ukham amuyasïna.
I didn't understand it.	Nayajj janiw amuykayätti.
He doesn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkiti.
He says something, she says something.	Jupax kuns siwa, jupax kuns siwa.
New and old.	Machaq ukat nayra.
But that doesn't mean that no one does.	Ukampis ukajj janiw khitis ukham lurkiti sañ munkiti.
It is very important in this respect.	Uka tuqitx wali wakiskiriwa.
They’re still worth it.	Jupanakax wali askiwa.
I hope to do that.	Nayajj uk lurañwa suytʼaskta.
So that's the letter.	Ukhama uka carta.
He is still important.	Jupajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He was a very friendly and happy man.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I had no idea how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw amuykayätti.
And before.	Ukat nayra.
I don't see anything.	Janiw kunas uk uñjkti.
I gave him a ride once.	Mä kutiw jupar mä kayuk sarañ churta.

But it rarely does.	Ukampis jukʼakiw ukham luraspa.
But I don't know anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns yatkti.
What's going on.	Kunas pasaski.
In fact, he loves it.	Chiqansa, jupax walpun munasi.
I was surprised to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj wal muspharta.
He knows a lot of great stuff.	Jupax walja jach’a yänak yati.

He had a problem here.	Jupax akanx mä jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
But the day is long gone.	Ukampis uka urux wali jaya pachaw saraski.

It is not necessary now.	Janiw jichhajj wakiskiti.
I wanted a new one chance and it was exciting.	Nayax machaq mä ch’am munta ukat wali kusiskañawa.
Or, no, that's not right.	Jan ukajj, janiw, ukajj janiw walïkiti.
This is a human being.	Akax jaqiwa.

He knows his name well.	Jupajj sutip sum yati.
Everything else isn’t.	Taqi kunas janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is one thing.	Mä kunaw utji.
Anywhere but him.	Kawkhansa jan ukasti jupar.
He wanted to know how I felt.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk yatiñwa munäna.
You don’t like me.	Jumax janiw nayar munktati.
The warm weather made for a shorter period this year.	Uka junt’u pachax mä jisk’a pacharuw aka marax lurawayi.
I don’t mean at all.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa sañ munkti.
Well that’s it.	Suma ukax.
He was a man of action.	Jupajj lurir jaqënwa.
He has no future in baseball.	Jupax janiw jutïr pachanx béisbol ukanx utjkiti.
Definitely a lovely character.	Chiqpachansa mä munat jaqiwa.
I’m sure you’re right.	Nayax chiqaw sasaw sista.
And it’s very difficult.	Ukat wali ch’amawa.
I wasn’t expecting anything.	Nayax janiw kuns suykayätti.
That’s something that really doesn’t happen to me.	Ukax mä chiqpachapuniw jan nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
But he spoke somehow.	Ukampis kunjamatsa parläna.
And, that’s pretty cool.	Ukat, ukax wali sumawa.
He said it was amazing.	Jupax muspharkañawa sasaw säna.
But so far it seems to work.	Ukampis jichhakamax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
And that’s a good thing.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa.
This is the hardest part for me.	Akax nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
Like anywhere else.	Kunjamtï kawkhans utjki ukhama.
He decides to tell everything.	Jupax taqi kun yatiyañ amti.
There's something.	Kunas utji.
Great energy is required.	Jach’a ch’amaw wakisi.
But he’s not like that.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Not like he should.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj lurañapäki ukhama.
True! 	Chiqa!
But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kunas lurkänti.
And there is plenty of time to do more.	Ukat jukʼamp lurañatakejj walja tiempow utji.
There is more to it than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw utji.
But then no one does.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
I was surprised to see you here.	Nayajj jumar akan uñjasajj wal muspharta.
It would be interesting to go there.	Uka chiqar sarañax wali askïspawa.
You need some time here.	Aka chiqanx mä juk’a pachaw munasispa.
He is a very strong man.	Jupax wali qhuru jaqiwa.
He didn't do that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurkänti.
You mean a lot to me, you know.	Jumax nayatakix wali askiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
He didn't say anything to them.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupanakar siskänti.
I don't know what to do with him now.	Jichhajj janiw kunsa jupamp lurañ yatkti.
I did it the same night.	Uka pachpa arumaw lurawayta.
Don’t let anyone control you.	Janiw khitirus apnaqañapatak jaytañamäkiti.
He talked for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow parläna.
It’s what he does.	Ukax kuntix jupax luraski ukawa.
And how it is.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajja.
Just like last week.	Kunjamtï pasïr semanan luraskäna ukhama.
No one needs that kind of money.	Janiw khitis ukham qullqix munaskiti.
I wish it hadn't happened to him.	Nayajj jupar jan pasañap munta.
I didn’t want to live without him.	Janiw jupamp jan jakañ munkayätti.
This is almost exactly what happened.	Ukajj niya ukhamarakiw pasäna.
It’s a very difficult thing.	Wali ch’amawa.
That’s pretty much everyone.	Ukax niya taqiniruw puri.
Eventually, he decided not to.	Qhepatjja, jan uka jan walinak lurañwa amtäna.
A soft voice.	Mä llamp’u aru.
And then he said nothing.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw kuns arskänti.
He seemed like a good guy.	Jupajj suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
I said yes to everything.	Nayax taqi kuns jïsa sasaw sista.
I thought he was having a great time.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi sasaw amuyayäta.
There was no night.	Janiw arumax utjkänti.
Something was wrong.	Kunas jan waliw utjäna.
Now, of course he means it.	Jichhax, chiqpachansa jupax ukham sañ muni.
But don’t do that.	Ukampis jan ukham luramti.
I’m going to go with you.	Nayaw jumamp chik sarä.
It took him a few hours.	Ukatakejj mä qhawqha horanakaw jupar pasäna.
I want to do that tonight.	Jichha arumax uk lurañ munta.
He wants to tell them.	Jupanakar yatiyañ muni.
It wasn’t what I expected.	Janiw kunjamtï suykayäta ukhamäkänti.
Nothing ever happened.	Janiw kunas janipuniw utjkänti.
And he walked with me.	Ukat jupax nayamp chikaw sarnaqäna.
Not too bad, really.	Janiw sinti jan walïkiti, chiqpachansa.
A beautiful day.	Mä suma uru.
How it wasn’t.	Kunjamsa jan ukhamäkänti.
Not this one!.	¡Janiw akax utjkiti!.
He will come to you.	Jupajj jumaruw jutani.
He’s done this before.	Jupax nayrax ukham luratayna.
He always lived in the moment.	Jupax sapa kutiw uka pachan jakasïna.
And he just told me what he really needed to do.	Ukat kuntï chiqpachapuni lurañapäkäna ukakiw sitäna.
The package itself was unique.	Uka pachpajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
He had no idea how long he had been lying there.	Qhawqha tiempos ukan ikiskäna uk janiw amuykänti.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nayax janiw kunjams lurañax ukx yatkti.
I don’t want to say it.	Nayax janiw sañ munkti.
So I'm still feeling sad.	Ukhamajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
He wanted to know that.	Jupajj uk yatiñwa munäna.
No one understood it.	Janiw khitis uk amuykänti.
Everything is going strong.	Taqi kunas ch’amampiw saraski.
Not the way he did it.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamäkiti.
I don't know enough about you.	Nayajj janiw jumat sum yatkti.
He did what he did.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk luräna.
And he didn’t know that.	Ukat jupax janiw uk yatkänti.
It’s really exciting here.	Aka chiqanx chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
You have yourself.	Jumax juma pachpaw utji.
Do what you need to do.	Kun lurañas wakisispa uk lurañamawa.

That’s first and tenth.	Ukax nayrïr ukat tunka.

I agreed to do it.	Uk lurañatakiw iyaw sista.
It can be a word or a part of a word.	Mä aru jan ukax mä arut mä chiqaw utjaspa.
So it’s pretty amazing.	Ukhamajj wali muspharkañawa.
He had now moved on to the other side of it.	Jupajj jichhajj uka yaqha toqetwa sarjjäna.
It rarely worked for long.	Ukajj jukʼakiw walja tiempo irnaqäna.
You only have to do this once.	Mä kutikiw uk lurañama.
Something really happened.	Kunas chiqpachapuni pasäna.
Or the moment he saw her, for that matter.	Jan ukajj kuna horasas jupar uñjäna, ukatakejj.
I don't want that to happen.	Janiw nayajj ukham pasañap munkti.
He knew it all before.	Jupajj nayraw taqe ukanak yatïna.
And he wanted to do it right.	Ukat sum lurañwa munäna.
I am not sure about this.	Nayajj janiw aka toqet sum yatkti.
About me, it’s.	Naya tuqitxa.
Now he was feeling better.	Jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He left them behind.	Jupajj jupanakar jaytawayi.
There will be no tomorrow.	Janiw qhipürux utjkaniti.
It is a beautiful sight.	Ukajj wali sumaw uñjasi.
That happened once.	Ukajj mä kutiw pasäna.
What is the value.	Kunas ukajja.
More or less at the same time.	Mä juk’a jan ukax juk’ampi pachpa pachan.
He wasn’t like that, once.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti, mä kutix.
He concluded that it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw tukuyäna.
They are nothing.	Jupanakajj janiw kunäkisa.
He almost understood.	Jupajj niyaw amuyasïna.
I would definitely do that.	Nayajj cheqapuniw ukham luraspäna.
I don't think he will.	Janiw jupajj ukham lurkaniti sasaw amuyta.
Everything is nice and delicious.	Taqi kunas wali suma ukat wali sumawa.
There was no problem there.	Ukanjja, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
But we were like that.	Ukampis jiwasajj ukhamänwa.
This requires two steps.	Ukatakejj pä lurañaw wakisi.
I don’t care now.	Nayax jichhax janiw kuns lurkti.
I don’t totally agree with that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx taqpach iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham siskänti.
About a week later.	Niya mä semana qhepatjja.
There was no lunch.	Janiw chika uru manq’añax utjkänti.
The box is here.	Ukaxa aka.
I can’t do any more.	Nayax janiw juk’amp lurañjamäkiti.
He came to me.	Jupajj nayaruw jutäna.
He said no, no you can’t do that.	Jupax janiw sasaw säna, janiw janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
But let’s be honest.	Ukampis chiqapar uñjañäni.
It’s really sad.	Chiqpachansa wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
I want that so bad.	Nayax ukax wali jan waliw munta.
So far everything has been good.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He says one of us.	Jupax jiwasan maynix siwa.
He watched the entire movie.	Jupajj taqpach película uñchʼukiskäna.
But no one knows that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk yatkiti.
You can’t have one without the other.	Janiw maynix jan maynix utjkaspati.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Inas mä urux, ukampis janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
You will have to do everything.	Taqi kun lurañaw wakisini.
It doesn’t matter the time.	Janiw tiempox wakiskiti.
Many times, he meant it.	Walja kutiw, jupax ukham sañ munäna.
He was short and thin.	Jupajj jiskʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqënwa.
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk janiw sum yatkti.
I won't be going for long.	Janiw jaya tiempo sarkäti.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
I understand how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk sum amuyta.
He didn't want her there.	Jupajj janiw ukan jupar munkänti.
It was a very exciting experience.	Wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He often received the letter from home.	Jupajj sapa kutiw utapat uka carta katoqäna.
Beer is like that.	Cerveza ukax ukhamawa.
Here’s what happened.	Akax kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
I didn’t really know what I wanted to say.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk janiw cheqpachapun yatkayätti.
He's a great guy.	Jupax jach'a jaqiwa.
It didn't say anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns arskänti.
He could have, but he didn't.	Jupajj ukham luraspänwa, ukampis janiw uk lurkänti.
Maybe he’s a.	Inas jupax mä.
I have no idea where to go from here.	Nayax janiw kawkirus aka chiqat sarañ amtkti.
What happened in the incident happened.	Kunatï uka jan waltʼäwin paskäna ukajj pasäna.
We need to do it.	Jiwasax lurañaw wakisi.
Nothing too bad about how he felt, really.	Janiw kunas sinti jan walïkiti kunjams jupax jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.
And he’s him.	Ukat jupax juparux.
I’m still waiting.	Nayax wali suyt’askta.
Good luck.	Suma luram.
That means more work for me.	Ukax nayatakix juk’amp irnaqañ sañ muni.
Once he saw someone like him.	Mä kutix jupar uñtasit khitirus uñjäna.
You know what’s out there.	Jumax yatisktawa kunanakas ukan utji.
He sees that as his responsibility.	Jupax ukaruw uñji kunatix jupax lurañapawa.
So far, there is no reason to do so.	Jichhakamax janiw kuna razonas ukham lurañax utjkiti.
That leads to a decision.	Ukaw mä amtar puri.
It could be good tonight.	Jichha arumax wali askïspawa.
The next day there was nothing.	Qhipürux janiw kunas utjkänti.
Which, of course, happened.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, ukhamaw pasäna.
I can’t believe how well everything is going for you.	Nayax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti kunjams taqi kunas jumatakix wali sum saraski.

No one wanted this stuff.	Janiw khitis aka yänak munkänti.

What happened is amazing.	Kunatï paskäna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
That lasted a year.	Ukajj mä maraw utjäna.
The weather is beautiful!.	¡Uka pachax wali sumawa!.
And so, of course.	Ukat ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
So now, we have both.	Ukhamajj jichhajj, panpachaniw utjistu.
I have done this a few times.	Mä qhawqha kutiw ukham lurawayta.

I want to see something.	Nayax kuns uñjañ munta.
If that works for you, that's fine.	Ukham lurañajj jumatak askïspa ukhajja, ukajj walikïskiwa.

But not these people.	Ukampis janiw aka jaqenakajj utjkiti.
So yeah, if that happens.	Ukhamajj jïsa, ukajj pasaspa ukhajja.
But it wasn't necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
It’s what it’s all about.	Ukax kunatix taqi kunas utjki ukawa.
I know he can do that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraspawa.
It was, of course.	Ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
But don't do what you think.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jumajj amuykta ukham lurañamäkiti.
Really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
Why is he a guy? 	¿Kunatsa jupajj?
In fact, that’s really cool.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I didn't do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.
He was well and truly alone.	Jupax wali suma ukat chiqpachapuniw sapakix jikxatasïna.
No, it was better.	Janiwa, jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
No one can do that.	Janiw khitis uk lurkaspati.
That's how it turned out.	Ukhamaw ukajj jikjjatasïna.
But that feels worse.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp jan waliw jikjjatasi.
I’m sure he loves you.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax jumarux walpun munasta.
He loved them so much.	Jupajj walpun jupanakar munasïna.
Two, maybe more than three years.	Pä, inas kimsa mara jila.
Not two, not three.	Janiw pä, jan kimsa.
These are more readily available.	Ukanakajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw jikjjatasi.
This wasn’t one.	Akax janiw mä utjkänti.

There’s nothing wrong with that.	Ukax janiw kunas utjkiti.

He does everything right.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sumwa luri.

As if that meant something.	Ukajj kuns sañ munkaspa ukhama.
No one wanted him.	Janiw khitis jupar munkänti.

So it felt really good.	Ukhamajj cheqapuniw wali sum jikjjatasïna.

He never wanted to give it up.	Jupajj janipuniw uk jaytañ munkänti.
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis janiw ukham siskänti.
I’m just out there.	Nayax ukhamakiw ukanx jikxatastxa.
I love you guys so much.	Nayajj jumanakar wal munasta.
He can do anything to me.	Jupajj nayarojj kuns luraspawa.
They don’t know.	Jupanakax janiw yatipkiti.
I know it doesn’t for me.	Nayax yattwa, nayatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
I was afraid to tell him anything about what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uka toqet kuns yatiyañ ajjsarayäta.
So you don't need that time.	Ukhamajj janiw uka tiempojj wakiskiti.
I probably think so.	Nayax inas ukham amuyta.
He wanted to leave, now.	Jupax sarxañ munäna, jichhax.
Anyone can do whatever they want.	Khitis kuntï munki uk luraspa.
You for that matter.	Jumax ukatakix.
I don’t know anyone around here.	Janiw khitirus aka jak’an uñt’kti.
It really works for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
He wanted to say the right thing and sat down.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk sañ munäna ukat qontʼasïna.

He was very clear about it.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali qhanaw arsüna.

We had to do all of this.	Taqi ukanak lurañaw wakisïna.

I’m in love with you.	Nayax munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
Really, really, it is.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
I don’t want to see him do that.	Janiw jupar ukham lurir uñjañ munkti.
I didn't know what to do.	Kun lurañsa janiw amuykayätti.
He seemed to be building a house.	Jupajj mä uta lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
He speaks to it.	Jupax ukaruw arsu.
I remember it very well.	Wali sum amtaskta.
There was never a need to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
This isn’t what’s going on right now.	Akax janiw kunatix jichhax utjki ukax utjkiti.

He doesn't want to see that happen again.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa ukham pasañap uñjañ munkiti.

And then I feel better.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasta.

He left so quickly.	Ukham jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
And that’s not the cool thing to do these days.	Ukat ukax janiw aka urunakanx thaya lurañax utjkiti.
He’s a good boy, such a good boy .	Jupax suma waynawa, ukham suma waynawa .
It felt unbearable.	Janiw aguantañjamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
And this is an important time.	Ukat aka tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
Now I don’t have to repeat that.	Jichhax janiw ukanak wasitat lurañax wakiskiti.
He’s really great.	Chiqpachansa jupax jach’a jaqiwa.
That was all that was left of him.	Ukakiw jupat qheparäna.

I can’t do anything about him.	Janiw jupat kuns lurirjamäkti.

I am, of course, sorry about that.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, ukat llakistwa.
Both are alone.	Panpachaniw sapaki.

He started with food.	Jupax manq’añ tuqit qalltäna.
What he meant was obvious.	Kuntï sañ munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
There was no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
That is very important in this case.	Ukajj aka toqet wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s barely necessary.	Ukax juk’akiw wakisi.
I don't know how that could happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw yatkti.
I have seen him for many years.	Walja maranakaw jupar uñjta.
Well worth the money!.	¡Uka qullqix wali askiwa!.
I thought we would have a little party.	Mä jiskʼa fiesta lurañäni sasaw amuyayäta.

He was just there.	Jupajj ukhamakiw utjäna.
I think he is too.	Nayax jupax ukhamarakiw sasaw amuyta.

I want to move somewhere else.	Nayax yaqha chiqar sarxañ munta.

Who is better than him.	Khitis jupat sipansa.
He doesn’t do any of that here, though.	Jupax janiw ukanak akanx kuns lurkiti, ukampis.
Would you do that.	¿Jumax ukham lurasmati.
That’s what ‘I’ am doing.	Ukax ‘naya’ ukham luraskta.
He is very important to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
I think otherwise.	Nayax yaqha tuqit amuyta.
But he didn't do these things.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurkänti.
But this is seriously cool.	Ukampis akax sinti wali sumawa.

Well, that’s what it says.	Ukhama, ukax akham siwa.
He is a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
This can take a while, a week or more.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempo, semana jan ukajj jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
That's what he told her.	Ukham sasaw jupar yatiyäna.
I’ve got that pretty hard.	Nayax ukax wali ch’amawa.
You’re so excited about it.	Jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatastaxa.
Would you like to come?.	¿Jumax jutañ munasmati?.
Of course, anything but.	Chiqansa, kuna jan ukasti.
Already a good book.	Nayratpach wali sum libro.
I had no idea about it at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw uka toqet kuns amuykayätti.
So that was something.	Ukhamajj ukajj mä kunaw utjäna.
And they know about me.	Ukat jupanakax nayat yatipxi.
And how he wants to live there.	Ukat kunjamsa ukan jakañ munaraki.
That’s the only thing that always works.	Ukakiw sapa kuti irnaqäna.
As it happened.	Kunjamtï paskäna ukhama.
Surprisingly no one did.	Muspharkañawa janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
I want to tell you.	Nayax jumanakar yatiyañ munta.
He wants to buy it.	Jupajj ukanak alañ muni.
He wants evil things.	Jupajj jan walinak muni.
He remained silent all this time.	Uka tiemponjja, amukiw qheparäna.
I asked him what he would do.	Kunsa lurani sasaw jisktʼta.
It’s really good for both of them.	Chiqpachansa panpachaniw ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
You have to tell him that.	Jumaw jupar ukham yatiyañama.
What time do you plan to get there?.	¿Kuna horasas uka chiqar puriñ amtaskta?.
But that's even better.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
You need to act on it as soon as possible.	Uka tuqitxa jankʼakiw lurañama.
If you want to, you can say no.	Jumatix munsta ukhax janiw sañ munktati.
Let me know what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk yatiyapxita.
Then he started doing it again with force.	Ukat wasitatwa chʼamampiw uk lurañ qalltäna.
But, happened it was.	Ukampis, pasäna ukax ukhamänwa.
I want to know everything about him.	Jupat taqe kun yatiñ munta.
That one word.	Uka mä aru.
That will happen one day.	Ukajj mä uruw utjani.
He decided to go to bed.	Jupax ikiñar sarañ amtäna.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	Kuna horasas khitirus ukham pasaspa.
Do what is necessary.	Kuntï wakiski uk luram.
In fact, he was asleep.	Chiqansa, jupax ikiskäna.
He had been asleep for two hours.	Jupajj pä horaw ikiskäna.
I don’t know how long.	Janiw qawqha pachas uk yatkti.
So he knew exactly how she felt.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I love everything you do.	Nayax taqi kuntix lurapkta ukx walpun munasta.
You're a great guy.	Jumax wali jach'a jaqïtawa.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw säna.
And he will do just that.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw lurani.
He said that he was.	Jupajj sasaw säna.
So never say never!.	Ukhamajj janipuniw janipuniw sañjamäkiti!.
Very, very poisonous.	Wali, wali suma.
Why exactly is that.	Kunatsa chiqpachansa ukhama.
Everyone there knows the language.	Ukanx taqiniw uka aru yatipxi.
Bad, bad, bad.	Jan wali, jan wali, jan wali.
But you love it so much.	Ukampis jumajj wal munasma.
There isn’t one thing.	Janiw mä kunas utjkiti.
It feels very good.	Ukajj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
I want to do the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw lurañ munta.
He had a good time with her.	Jupampiw wali sum sarnaqäna.
He could have done that.	Jupajj ukham luraspänwa.
I want him here.	Nayax juparux akan munta.
There wasn’t any heat.	Janiw kuna junt’u pachas utjkänti.
I never intended to do any of that.	Janipuniw ukanak lurañ amtkti.
He doesn’t want one.	Jupax janiw mä munkiti.
He had a fool about her.	Jupajj jupat mä loqhe jaqënwa.
He cannot say no.	Jupajj janiw janiw sañjamäkiti.
I want to walk around.	Nayax sarnaqañ munta.
He was doing very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraskäna.
Things aren’t looking great for you right now.	Kunanakas janiw jichhax jumatakix wali askïkiti.
But in another way, it is fascinating.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa, wali muspharkañawa.
You know, something nice.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunas wali suma.
But do it well.	Ukampis sum luram.
But that was last year.	Ukampis ukajj pasïr maraw pasäna.
Here, it didn’t exist.	Akax, janiw utjkänti.
That was about everything.	Ukajj taqe kunat parläna.
It’s a secret of course.	Ukax mä jamasat chiqpachansa.
You know about everything but he feels right.	Jumax yatisktawa taqi kunatsa ukampis jupax chiqaw sasaw amuyasi.
Kind of like that.	Mä kasta ukhama.
I don’t really remember.	Janiw chiqpachapuni amtaskti.
And now about that.	Ukat jichhax uka tuqitxa.
Everything is amazing.	Taqi kunas muspharkañawa.
I don't know exactly.	Janiw nayajj sum yatkti.
It’s a little bit .	Ukax mä juk’a .
He has always been like that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
I’ll go, if you want to go.	Nayax sarä, jumatix sarañ munsta ukhaxa.
But I am not like that.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
No one knows that.	Janiw khitis uk yatkti.
That same morning he told me.	Uka pachpa alwaw jupajj sitäna.
What more can he do.	¿Kunsa jupajj jukʼamp luraspa.
He thought he knew.	Jupajj yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
I don’t know what he’s doing.	Janiw kuntix jupax luraski uk yatkti.
I don't understand it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw sum amuykti.
What you do matters.	Kuntï lurkta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
It had to be done.	Uk lurañaw wakisïna.
The latter is more important.	Uka qhipa tuqitxa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
But that is not possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I understand what you are saying.	Kuntï jumajj siskta uk sum amuyta.
I tried to do this in two ways.	Ukatakejj pä toqetwa chʼamachasiyäta.
There is no need to do that here.	Janiw akan ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
They were three years he completed.	Jupanakajj kimsa maraw jupajj tukuyäna.
We weren’t like that.	Jiwasax janiw ukhamäkänti.
Now, he’s worried.	Jichhax, jupax llakitaw jikxatasi.
There was one, yes.	Ukanx mayniw utjäna, jïsa.
I told him this for the last time.	Nayajj qhep qhepa kutiw jupar akham sista.
We’re still.	Jiwasax wali.
He decided to go somewhere.	Kawkirus sarañ amtäna.
Instead of the current one.	Jichhax utjki ukat sipansa.
But there was never anything to do.	Ukampis janipuniw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
You have to do it.	Uk lurañamawa.
There was more to it.	Ukanjja, jukʼampiw utjäna.
Now she wondered why she thought that.	Jichhajj kunatsa ukham amuyayäta sasaw jisktʼasïna.
I'm so sorry for him.	Jupat wal llakista.
What he was saying.	Kunsa jupajj siskäna.
Like yours, here.	Kunjamtï jumanakan lurapkta ukhama, akan.
But that is not the case with us.	Ukampis janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
I’m afraid this is it.	Nayax axsaratwa akax ukhamawa.
No one thought it was possible.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykänti.
He never wanted to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I’m not sure, at least not yet.	Nayax janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti, mä juk’a pachax janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
But it is not necessary to do so.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He was, indeed.	Jupajj ukhamänwa, cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
You’re feeling that way.	Jumax ukham jikxatastaxa.
I know.	Yattwa.
It’s now or never!.	¡Jichhax jan ukax janipuniw ukhamäkiti!.
He accepted it.	Jupajj uk katoqäna.
Everything is going so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw saraski.
He said that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
This can happen many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasaspa.
I don’t want to go out with anyone.	Nayax janiw khitimpis mistuñ munkti.
Everything felt good, really.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.
It’s going to be a good day.	Ukax mä suma uruw sañ muni.
The future is bright.	Jutïr pachanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Why is there no money?.	¿Kunatsa jan qullqix utjki?.
It’s really important.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
But he doesn't quite understand.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sum amuykiti.
He doesn’t go to bed.	Janiw ikiñar sarkiti.
It’s just a movie.	Mä película ukhamakiw utji.
Maybe, a little bit.	Inas, mä juk’a.
I didn’t want to sleep.	Janiw ikiñ munkayätti.
He looked like he didn't want to talk.	Jupajj jan parlañ munkaspa ukham uñnaqäna.
I didn't tell him much.	Janiw nayajj jupar wal siskti.
So that's not a good thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw walïkiti.
I gave him everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa churta.
More and more and more.	Juk’ampi juk’ampi juk’ampi.
He was clearly shocked at what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk uñjasajj qhanaw muspharäna.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjañ munkayätti.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns puedkänti.
I want to know what’s going on.	Nayax kunas pasaski uk yatiñ munta.
I’ll do it again.	Wasitat lurani.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
That is definitely wrong.	Ukajj cheqapuniw jan walïkiti.
Surprisingly many.	Muspharkañawa walja.
And, there’s plenty of space there.	Ukat, ukanx walja chiqaw utji.
I don't know too much about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet sinti sum yatkti.
There was no way he could do that.	Ukjja janiw kunjamatsa lurkaspänti.
Sure, he could, but he didn’t want to.	Chiqpachansa, jupax luraspawa, ukampis janiw munkänti.
That was different two years ago.	Ukajj pä mara nayrajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
That’s really important.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
That was three days ago.	Ukajj kimsa uru nayraw pasäna.
He was right about one thing.	Jupajj mä toqetwa cheq parläna.
So you don't have to do that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurañamäkiti.
He started saying something.	Jupax kuns sañ qalltäna.
The man didn't say anything.	Uka jaqejj janiw kuns siskänti.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
It’s not what you think it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.
That’s it, more or less.	Ukax ukhamawa, juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
You have to do it yourself.	Ukjja juma pachpaw lurañama.
But that was not the case .	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
And beyond you.	Ukat jumat sipansa.
He knew how to make coffee.	Jupax café lurañ yatïna.
But he didn't say that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukham siskänti.
I don’t want to.	Nayax janiw munkti.
That makes me feel better.	Ukaw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasta.
I need a man.	Nayax mä chacharuw munta.
So never again.	Ukhamajj janipuniw mayampsa.
One thing he knew well.	Mä toqet jupajj sum yatïna.
That is more important to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
I love her so much.	Nayajj jupat walpun munasta.
I don’t know why, it just is.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, ukhamakiw ukhama.
You know how he is.	Jumax kunjamsa jupax uk yatisktawa.
I really enjoyed this one.	Chiqpachansa akax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
But who wanted him to do it.	Ukampis uk lurañapatak khitis munäna.
I don’t want to do it here.	Janiw nayax akan lurañ munkti.
Never never never.	Janipuniw janipuniw janipuniw.
There is no one constant.	Janiw mä sapa kutis utjkiti.
What is the basis for this?.	¿Kuna tuqitsa ukham lurañax wakisispa?.
That’s who nobody likes.	Ukax khitirus janiw khitis gustkiti.
That’s why he’s doing it.	Ukatwa jupax ukham luraski.
So I was like that.	Ukhamajj nayajj ukhamänwa.
But I can't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurirjamäkti.
I want to know what happened there.	Kunas ukan pasäna uk yatiñ munta.
He’s always so right.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham chiqapar uñji.
Now he’s going somewhere.	Jichhax kawkirus sarxani.
He was watching himself.	Jupa pachpaw uñchʼukiskäna.
You don’t have to do everything alone.	Janiw sapakix taqi kun lurañamäkiti.
But there is no time limit.	Ukampis janiw kuna horasas utjkiti.
I have no idea what is going on.	Kunas pasaski uk janiw amuykti.
Nothing and everything at once.	Janiw kunas utjkiti ukat taqi kunas mä kutikiw utji.
But it’s still important.	Ukampis wali wakiskiriwa.
He understands how it feels for me.	Kunjamsa nayatakejj jikjjatasi uk amuyasi.
I want to know what happened next.	Uka qhepat kunas pasäna uk yatiñwa munta.
He has only me.	Jupajj naya sapakiw utji.
But that is not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That was not the case at the time.	Uka tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It takes time to do it right.	Uk sum lurañatakix tiempow munasispa.
But you have to do it yourself.	Ukampis juma pachpaw lurañama.
I was surprised that he did.	Ukham luratapat wal muspharta.
That’s what we need.	Ukaw jiwasatak wakisi.
Clearly there is work to be done here.	Qhanaw akanx lurañax utji.
I love this country.	Nayax aka markarux walpun munasta.
I can’t remember why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amtaskti.
He did something wrong, not me.	Jupajj jan walinak luräna, janiw nayajj jan wal lurkänti.
But he doesn't like her.	Ukampis jupajj janiw jupar munaskiti.
And he says he is.	Ukat jupax siwa.
I kind of know what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk mä jukʼa yattwa.
I had no idea how to do this today.	Jichhürunakan kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janiw amuykayätti.
He said he felt better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasta sasaw säna.
He doesn’t know where to go.	Jupax janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkiti.
The next day is even better.	Qhipürux jukʼamp sumaw uñjasi.
What happens and what it costs.	Kunas pasaspa ukat kuna qullqis munasispa.
That’s not to say.	Ukax janiw sañjamäkiti.
Don't know why though.	Janiw yatkti kunatsa ukampis.
But that is more important.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
And everything is fine.	Ukat taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
But he doesn't know much about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet sum yatkiti.
No, that's not a problem.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Not right, he thought.	Janiw walïkiti, sasaw amuyäna.
This takes about two hours.	Ukatakejj niya pä horaw munasispa.
I was very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I have no idea what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janiw amuykti.
Anything, at least.	Kunas, mä juk’a.
He was a completely different person now.	Jupajj jichhajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
This still feels right.	Ukax wali chiqaw sasaw amuyasi.
I understood that really well.	Ukjja, cheqapuniw sum amuyayäta.
You know what to do.	Jumax yatisktawa kuns lurañama.
No, not really, but it feels like it.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti, ukampis ukham amuyasi.
I didn’t get that last time.	Qhip qhipa kutix janiw uk jikxatkti.
He said as he was told.	Jupajj kunjamtï siskäna ukhamaw säna.
He didn't say yes or no.	Jupajj janiw jïsa jan ukajj janiw sasaw siskänti.
He shuddered at the sound.	Uka aru istʼasajj chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
And he loves her so much.	Ukat jupar wal munasi.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkiti.
This is very important to you.	Ukajj jumatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
But it had to be done.	Ukampis uk lurañaw wakisïna.
Very impressive in every way.	Taqi tuqit wali muspharkañawa.
We will take good care of them.	Jiwasajj jupanakar sum uñjañäni.
I was the first one to do it.	Nayaw nayrïr kutix uk lurayäta.
I’m kind of waiting.	Nayax mä juk’a suyt’askta.
Something was definitely happening over there.	Kunas uka chiqanx chiqpachapuniw luraskäna.
I never once thought of leaving here.	Janipuniw mä kutis aka chiqat sarxañ amtkti.
You know, that doesn’t matter.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
That doesn’t mean it.	Ukax janiw sañ munkiti.
But he wants to do better in this future.	Ukampis jupajj aka jutïrin jukʼamp sum lurañwa muni.
So you definitely can.	Ukhamajj cheqapuniw ukham lurasma.
I think I think so.	Nayax ukham amuyta sasaw amuyta.
I expect the same from you.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jumanakat suyaskta.
Even the bad weather is good.	Jan wali pachas wali askiwa.
He learned a lot from him.	Jupat wal yateqäna.
One morning that worked for me.	Mä alwajj ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
He rubbed himself against her.	Jupa pachpaw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
To be honest, it’s his first time.	Chiqpachansa, jupax nayrïr kutiw ukham luri.
I need someone to go to me.	Nayax khitirus nayar sarañapatak munta.
How do you do it.	Kunjamsa lurasma.
I don’t want that to happen to anyone.	Janiw khitirus ukham pasañap munkti.
I already feel happier.	Nayax niyaw jukʼamp kusisit jikxatastxa.
All of these are excellent.	Taqi ukanakax wali sumawa.
But I don’t have a future here.	Ukampis nayatakix janiw jutïr pachax aka chiqanx utjkiti.
This has been a great day.	Akax mä jach’a uruw utjawayi.
The year goes by quickly.	Marax jank’akiw saraski.
I don’t know where it is.	Janiw kawkhans uk yatkti.
Both of those times are fine for me.	Uka pä tiemponjja, nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
Because it is now.	Kunatix jichhax ukhamawa.
He did it for a very long time.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow uk luräna.
I’m going to go to him.	Nayaw jupan ukar sarä.
It has always been about you.	Ukajj nayratpachaw jumat parläna.
There is no problem there.	Ukanjja janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I need to do this.	Nayax uk lurañaw wakisi.
I did not know all this at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukanak taqe kunsa yatkayätti.
But that is obvious.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
And it kind of is.	Ukat mä kasta ukhamawa.
But I really have nothing.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
I don't know how to help you.	Janiw kunjamsa jumar yanaptʼañ yatkti.
So it's kind of weird.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
I hope it happens soon.	Nayax jank’akiw ukham lurasiñap suyt’askta.
We like it here.	Jiwasax akanx wali askiwa.
The way he looked.	Kunjamsa jupax uñnaqäna.
I’m waiting for you.	Nayax suyt’askta.
Almost no one can do that.	Niya janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati.
This is the guy.	Akax uka jaqiwa.
He was such a wonderful person.	Jupajj ukham wali suma jaqënwa.
But that’s it, no.	Ukampis ukax ukhamawa, janiwa.
This is obvious to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasi.
It’s barely there now.	Jichhax juk’akiw ukanx utji.
He made coffee.	Jupax café luratayna.
It’s a very difficult time.	Uka pachax wali ch’amawa.
He knew how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ yatïna.
But he couldn't do it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw puedkänti.
Amount.	Qawqha.
I see this all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw uk uñjta.
There were no people anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans jaqinakax utjkänti.
And it’s really worth it.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
It was a beautiful morning.	Uka alwajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He seemed very old .	Jupajj wali chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa .
He doesn't understand.	Jupajj janiw amuykiti.
Anyway, this is it.	Kawkhansa, akax ukhamawa.
He thought he understood everything.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sum amuyta sasaw amuyäna.
He’s going through three construction sites.	Jupax kimsa lurañ utan sarnaqaski.
No one is anything.	Janiw khitis kunäkisa.
I love the country.	Nayax uka markarux walpun munasta.
I wonder what he wants from me this time, she thought.	Kunsa aka kutin nayat munta sasaw jisktʼasta, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Not this time around.	Janiw jichha kutin ukhamäkiti.
This now seems impossible.	Ukax jichhax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw uñjasi.
Is it really necessary? 	¿Chiqapunit ukax wakisi?
I feel that he did.	Ukhamwa luräna sasaw amuyasta.
I started drinking a lot.	Walja umañ qalltawayta.
I had no idea what to do or what to expect next.	Kun lurañas ni kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
So it doesn't matter now.	Ukhamajj janiw jichhajj kunäkisa.
And he wanted to see this man.	Ukat jupax aka jaqir uñjañ munäna.
But, more needs to be done.	Ukampis, jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
First thing yesterday.	Nayrïr kunaw qharüru.
I don’t need a house like that.	Nayax janiw ukham utax munaskiti.
I’ve seen it a lot.	Uk walpun uñjta.
But not too much.	Ukampis janiw sinti.
I think he thought he was in charge.	Nayax amuyta, jupax jupaw apnaqi sasaw amuyäna.
It took a long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
I don’t see why not.	Janiw uñjkti kunatsa jan ukhamäki.

He was a very beloved man.	Jupajj wali munat jaqënwa.
The same thing.	Uka pachpa.
It took a very long time.	Ukatakejj wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
But there is a fact.	Ukampis mä chiqaw utji.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
So small, so new.	Ukhama jisk’a, ukhama machaq.
He went a little ahead of me.	Jupajj nayat mä jukʼa nayraw saräna.
You can’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
I can’t remember anywhere else.	Janiw kawkhans yaqha tuqit amtaskti.
I doubt you would.	Nayax pächastwa jumax ukham lurasma.
I was so happy to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj walpun kusista.
That’s really awesome.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali muspharkañawa.
This was not the case then or there.	Ukajj janiw uka tiempon ni uka cheqan utjkänti.
He’s still a human being.	Jupax wali jaqiwa.
This beer is delicious.	Aka cerveza ukax wali sumawa.
I want that to happen.	Nayax uk munta.
There are times when it’s available.	Kuna pachas ukax utji.
And you weren’t like that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukhamäkänti.
He saw it happening.	Jupajj ukham luraskäna uk uñjäna.
He said he didn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw säna.
He understands how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sumwa amuyi.
So sorry, to do this though.	Ukhamajj perdón, aka lurañatakejj ukampis.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Jichhajj kuntï munki uk luraspawa.

I think he’s out there somewhere.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kawkhans ukan jikxatasi.
It looks unusual.	Ukax jan uñt’at uñtatawa.
Because there won’t be tomorrow.	Kunatix qharürux janiw utjkaniti.
He kind of refused.	Jupajj mä jukʼa janiw munkänti.
He told me not to do anything.	Jan kuns luramti sasaw sitäna.
It’s very difficult there.	Ukanx wali ch’amawa.
And it really rains a lot in that area.	Ukat chiqpachansa uka chiqanx walpun jallu puri.
So we should do the same.	Ukhamajj jiwasajj ukhamarakiw lurañasa.
Of course, you need permission not to.	Chiqansa, jan uk lurañatakix permiso munasispa.
He likes me. I like him.	Jupajj nayaruw gustitu.

Maybe one day.	Inas mä urux.
But it is, and it’s doing well.	Ukampis ukhamawa, ukat wali sum luraski.
I don’t want to do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurañ munkti.
I think that means it doesn’t exist.	Nayax amuyta ukax janiw utjkiti sañ muni.
Why did he do that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna.
The night is still dark.	Arumax wali ch’amawa.
He did it with great vigour.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw uk luräna.
I just don't like him.	Nayajj janiw jupar gustkituti.
I’m not the only one who knows about this place.	Janiw naya sapakix aka chiqat yatkti.
He wants to know how.	Kunjamsa uk yatiñ muni.
After the installation.	Uka qhepatjja.
I want to take it out.	Nayax ukanak apsuñ munta.
He couldn't talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ puedkänti.
But you know the rules.	Ukampis jumax kamachinak yatisktawa.
But that doesn't work for me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatak askïkiti.
And finally, he was very happy.	Ukat qhepatjja, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That's what he thought.	Ukaw jupajj amuyäna.
He took out three.	Jupajj kimsa apsüna.
I love the film.	Nayax película ukarux walpun munasta.
It’s that time again.	Uka pachax wasitatwa purini.
He’s actually really nice.	Jupax chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
Not the case here.	Janiw akanx ukhamäkiti.
She thought he was a rough guy.	Jupajj wali qhuru jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
I didn’t expect that.	Janiw ukham suykayätti.
But he wasn't like that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
This is the one.	Akax ukawa.
What we need to do.	Kunsa lurañasa.
I don’t have anything.	Nayax janiw kunas utjkituti.
But it goes very quickly.	Ukampis wali jankʼakiw saraski.
I had no idea why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
Everyone knows that.	Taqinipuniw ukham yatipxi.
And he took another one.	Ukat yaqha apsüna.
A first you.	Mä nayrïr juma.
I didn’t want that to happen again.	Janiw mayamp ukham pasañap munkayätti.
I'm not going to be able to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukhamäkti.
He knows the problem all too well.	Jupajj uka jan waltʼäwejj wali sum yati.
In fact, he is a character.	Chiqansa, jupax mä jaqiwa.
But there is nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He was the only guy.	Jupa sapakiw uka waynax utjäna.
I like everything about it.	Nayatakix taqi kunas uka tuqit wali askiwa.
It will be a great night, though.	Mä jachʼa arumaw utjani, ukampis.
There’s a plane waiting.	Mä avión ukaw suyt’aski.
He was like that.	Jupax ukhamänwa.
Overall, it’s worth it.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukax wali askiwa.
I kind of like that.	Nayax mä juk’a ukham munta.
He never liked me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayar gustkituti.
But how does it work? 	Ukampis ¿kunjamatsa?
There was no time to do what he wanted.	Kuntï jupax munkäna uk lurañatakix janiw tiempox utjkänti.
I like this one very much.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa.
He really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkänti.
This is funny, you think.	Akax wali muspharkañawa, jumax amuyta.
But that wasn't necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskänti.
Almost no one attends.	Niya janiw khitis uka tantachäwir sarkiti.
Tell me everything, tell me every last little thing.	Taqi kun yatiyapxita, sapa qhipa jisk’a yänak yatiyapxita.

Of course that is not the case.	Chiqansa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t do things like that.	Janiw ukham lurañanak lurkti.
He’s actually almost a little weird.	Jupax chiqpachansa niya mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
Maybe one day there will be time.	Inas mä urux tiempox utjaspa.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Jupajj janiw jichhakamax kuns lurkiti.
It doesn’t do it wrong.	Jan waliw uk luri.
What he did was not.	Kuntï lurkäna ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But there was nothing wrong with that night.	Ukampis uka arumax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
What are your characteristics?.	¿Kunanakas jumanakan utji?.
I am absolutely aware of this.	Nayajj uka toqet taqe chuymaw yatta.
And they didn’t have all that.	Ukat jupanakax janiw taqpach ukax utjkänti.
And it arrived very early.	Ukat wali nayraw purini.
It was never anywhere.	Janiw kunapachas kawkhans utjkänti.
I didn’t really mean it.	Janiw cheqpachapun uk sañ munkayätti.
He came to you after his death.	Jupajj jiwjjäna uka qhepatwa jumanakan ukar jutäna.
So how do we do it.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa lurañasa.
He will love it.	Jupajj uk munasini.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Kunas jupat pasani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Someone spent the day at home.	Mayniw urux utapan jikxatasïna.
More of that will come later.	Ukajj jukʼampiw qhepat jutani.
But at the time, everything seemed possible.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, taqe kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s something he doesn’t do well.	Mä kunaw jupax jan sum lurañ yati.
There is nothing like it.	Ukanjja, janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
But you are a different person.	Ukampis jumajj yaqha jaqewa.
Your snowflake.	Juman ch’uqi ch’uqi.
It’s more of an opportunity.	Ukax juk’amp mä oportunidad ukhamawa.
That’s really hard for me.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix ch’amawa.
It has everything you need to do it.	Ukanjja, taqe kunatï uk lurañatakejj wakiski ukanakaw utji.
I told him the same thing.	Nayajj jupar ukhamarakiw sista.
But how do you do that.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk lurasma.
Something stirred him.	Kunas juparux ch’allxtayäna.
There's a.	Ukanx mä.
He was never like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He decided immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw amtäna.
And that’s good, of course.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
Just like you would yourself.	Kunjamtï juma pachpajj lurasma ukhama.
It went well.	Sumaw saräna.
You don't have to do it all in a huge amount of time.	Janiw mä jachʼa pachan taqpach lurañax wakiskiti.
I hope I don’t have to do that in the winter.	Nayax suyt’twa juyphi pachanx janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He refused to talk about what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uka toqet janiw parlañ munkänti.
I love it even more.	Nayajj jukʼampiw munasta.
I don’t want to see it used.	Janiw uka apnaqañ uñjañ munkti.
We’ve got it going!.	¡Jiwasax ukax wali ch’amawa!.
I can’t really say that.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukham sañjamäkiti.
I don't mean to say.	Janiw nayajj sañ munkti.
I don't know anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns yatkti.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Ukampis kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamawa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali sumawa.
That is surprising.	Ukajj muspharkañawa.
Much bigger than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
I want to talk to you.	Nayax parlañ munta.
Now you have to say that to yourself.	Jichhax juma pachpaw ukham sañama.
It’s what’s inside you.	Ukax kunatix chuyma manqhan utjki ukawa.
I was afraid to take a chance.	Nayajj mä oportunidad apsuñ ajjsarayäta.
I heard him once.	Mä kutiw jupar istʼta.
It’s very rarely found.	Ukax wali juk’akiw jikxatasi.
Of course, he didn't really want to see it.	Chiqansa, janiw chiqpachapuni uñjañ munkänti.
I wanted to go by my own feelings.	Naya pachpaw kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sarañ munta.
I don't know how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw yatkti.
He looks about twenty.	Jupax niya pä tunk uñnaqaniwa.
Actually, it's kind of interesting to me.	Chiqansa, nayatakix mä jukʼa wali askiwa.
He asked for it.	Jupajj uk mayïna.
I think it’s him.	Nayax jupaw sasaw amuyta.
That would be a good thing.	Ukax wali askïspawa.
This is certainly necessary, but not required.	Ukajj cheqapuniw wakisi, ukampis janiw wakiskiti.
It seemed to have a heart.	Ukajj chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s obvious, to me at least.	Ukax qhanaw uñjasi, nayatakix mä juk’a.
Now he wanted to know more.	Jichhajj jukʼampiw yatiñ munäna.
It was definitely moving, but not bad.	Ukajj cheqapuniw sarnaqäna, ukampis janiw jan walïkiti.
I haven’t seen that in many, many years.	Walja, walja maranakaw jan ukham uñjkti.

He said he could do things himself.	Jupa pachpaw kuns lurasma sasaw säna.
It was a perfect lunch.	Ukajj chika uru manqʼañatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.

He is eager to help.	Jupajj yanaptʼañ wal muni.
I have never seen anything do what it does well.	Janipuniw kunas kuntï luraski uk sum lurir uñjkti.
Let's see what he has.	Kuntï jupajj utjki uk uñjañäni.
Something was out there.	Kunas uka anqan utjäna.

He knew that no one thought so.	Janiw khitis ukham amuykänti sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.

The more you can do, the better.	Jukʼamp lurañjamäki ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.

I really love him.	Chiqpachansa, juparux walpun munasta.
I don't believe them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar creykti.
He called her out.	Jupaw jupar jawsäna.
I’m so worried about that.	Nayax uka tuqit wal llakista.
He’s going to get there.	Jupax ukaruw purini.
You know better than that.	Jumaw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatta.
He felt this way for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham jikjjatasïna.

Very small and very nice.	Wali jisk’a ukat wali suma.

And so he did.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj luräna.

He started very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw qalltäna.

Please let me know.	Ukhamajj nayar yatiyapjjeta.
So, it doesn’t matter to me one way or the other.	Ukhama, janiw nayatakix mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqit wakiskiti.

There was nothing more he could do.	Ukham lurasajj janiw jukʼamp lurañ puedkänti.
It’s been a great year.	Mä jach’a maraw utjawayi.
He said he wanted to see her again and again.	Jupax wasitat wasitat uñjañ munta sasaw säna.

He didn't want to say no.	Jupajj janiw “janiw” sañ munkänti.
Well, yeah, yeah.	Ukhama, jïsa, jïsa.
But there was a light.	Ukampis mä qhanaw utjäna.
Every man is important.	Sapa chachax wali wakiskiriwa.
He was the one who left.	Jupaw sarjjäna.
Instead, someone told him.	Jan ukasti mayniw jupar yatiyäna.
Why, he wasn’t sure.	Kunatsa, jupax janiw sum yatkänti.
But he could have done that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham luraspänwa.

I don't tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus siskti.

It could have done it.	Ukajj luraspänwa.
He didn't want to see it.	Jupajj janiw uk uñjañ munkänti.
The whole time he was with me.	Taqi uka tiemponjja, nayamp chikaw sarnaqäna.

And that’s very important to me.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.

I couldn't understand why no one did.	Kunatsa jan khitis uk lurkäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
There was nothing here.	Akanx janiw kunas utjkänti.
But I don't remember anything about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet kunsa amtaskti.
That's how he got the money.	Ukhamaw jupajj qollqe katoqäna.
He is doing a good job of it.	Ukatakejj wali sumwa luraski.

For one thing, he really knows what he’s doing.	Mä tuqitxa, jupax chiqpachapuniw kuntï luraski uk sum yati.

But he was an important man.	Ukampis jupajj wali wakiskir jaqënwa.
Of course not.	Chiqansa janiwa.

Let's see how long it takes.	Qhawqha tiempos munasispa uk uñjañäni.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Janiw kuntï jupajj luraskäna uk yatkänti.
That is what happened in the past.	Ukaw nayrajj pasäna.

I don’t know what’s up with this.	Janiw nayax yatkti kunas aka tuqitxa.

He didn't do that now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukham lurkänti.

He knew photos.	Jupajj fotonak yatïna.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañas utjkänti.

I was waiting for it.	Uk suykayäta.

That would be more useful.	Ukajj jukʼamp askïspawa.
This will take a long time.	Ukatakejj wali tiempow munasini.
Never, never, never.	Janipuniw, janipuniw, janipuniw.
Really bad right now.	Chiqpachansa jan waliw jichhax.
And he knows everything.	Ukat jupax taqi kun yati.
He doesn’t know who he is.	Jupax janiw khitïnsa uk yatkiti.
In a positive way, of course.	Mä suma tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
He refused to take them out.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar apsuñ munkänti.
So much for the first time.	Ukhama nayrïr kuti.
It feels real.	Chiqpach ukham jikxatasi.
It didn’t seem like anything special outside.	Janiw anqan kunas wali askïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
You make the rules.	Jumax kamachinak lurasma.
He lived with me for many years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw nayamp chika jakasïna.
And if anything happens, it's fine.	Ukat kunas pasaspa ukhajja, walikïskiwa.
Now, bigger and bigger.	Jichhax, juk’amp jach’a ukat jach’a.
I loved him inside me.	Nayan manqhan jupar munasïna.
The man was something else.	Uka jaqejj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He knew exactly where he lived.	Jupajj kawkhansa uka jaqejj jakasïna uk sum yatïna.
That's what happened.	Ukaw pasani.
Because you think you said something wrong.	Kunatix jumax kuns jan wal arsuwayta sasaw amuyasta.

Of course, one could.	Chiqansa, maynix ukham luraspänwa.
That’s the way it is now.	Jichhax ukhamawa.
We will ever do that.	Jiwasajj kunapachas ukham lurañäni.
He really didn’t want to go there.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka chiqar sarañ munkänti.
He doesn't think so.	Jupajj janiw ukham amuykiti.
He wants to take it.	Jupax uka apsuñ muni.
It feels heartless.	Jan chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
I’m going to say this.	Nayax akham sañ munta.
Anyway, that’s it for me.	Kawkhansa, ukax nayatakix ukhamawa.
It was, at least.	Ukhamänwa, mä jukʼa.
He doesn't want to talk.	Janiw parlañ munkiti.
I’m not, of course.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkti, chiqpachansa.
That’s not really interesting.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapunix wali askïkiti.
He did leave.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sarjjäna.
It looks good to me.	Nayatakix wali sumaw uñtasi.
He looks so small.	Jupax wali jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
Of course there is nothing.	Chiqansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
Small ones, of course.	Jisk’a jisk’a, chiqpachansa.
I think he did the right thing.	Nayax amuyta, jupax chiqaw luratayna.
The facts are obvious.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
I don’t need this.	Nayax janiw akax wakiskiti.

He’s right there.	Jupax chiqaw ukan jikxatasi.
But we are .	Ukampis jiwasajj .
I didn't think that was a good idea.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukham janiw amuyirïkti.
That lasted three weeks.	Ukajj kimsa semanaw utjäna.
He watched her for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jupar uñjäna.
The money was made very quickly.	Qullqix wali jank’akiw jikxatasïna.
I’m worried about something else.	Nayax yaqha tuqit llakistwa.
I want to know a little more.	Mä jukʼamp yatiñ munta.
I don't know why, but he is.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, ukampis jupajj ukhamawa.
There will be something, there will be.	Kunas utjani, utjani.
I don’t mean well.	Janiw sum sañ munkti.
One thing at a time.	Mä kunaw mä kutin utji.
He gave me his name.	Jupaw sutip churitu.
It would be really useful.	Chiqpachansa wali askïspawa.
It’s a little too hard.	Mä juk’a sinti ch’amawa.
My own feelings are the opposite.	Naya pachpaw kunjamsa jikjjatasta ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
In the latter case.	Qhipa tuqitxa.
A lot happened during that time.	Uka tiemponjja, walpun pasäna.
But somehow it doesn’t matter.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw kunäkisa.
Well, not really, no.	Ukhama, janiwa chiqpachansa, janiwa.
Other than yourself.	Juma pachpat sipansa yaqha.
You want something like me.	Jumax kuns nayar uñtasit munta.
But he refused to go.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
Looking forward to the next book.	Jutïr libro suytʼaskta.
There was another week after that.	Uka qhepatjja, yaqha semanaw utjäna.
I never thought I could do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyirïkti.
I really want to talk to you.	Chiqpachansa jumamp parltʼañ munta.
He could have done anything.	Jupajj kunsa luraspänwa.
I didn't know that myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw uk yatkayätti.
I never did it again, I don’t intend to do it again.	Janiw mayamps lurkti, janiw mayamps lurañ amtkti.
Or it wouldn't exist.	Jan ukajj janiw utjkaspati.
And I’ve been in my bed for about two hours.	Ukat nayax niya pä horaw nayan ikiñan jikxatasiyäta.
But I had no choice, really.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti, chiqpachansa.
I can't find how to give this away.	Nayax janiw kunjams akax churañ jikxatkti.
Let me know what you see or don't see.	Kuntï uñjkta jan ukajj jan uñjkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
Of course he didn't know very well.	Chiqansa jupax janiw sum yatkänti.
No one understood it well.	Janiw khitis sum amuyaskänti.
I think that’s okay.	Nayax ukax walikïskiwa sasaw amuyta.
I haven’t seen that happen yet.	Janiw jichhakamax ukham lurasiñap uñjkti.
He had something.	Jupajj kunas utjäna.
He wanted to know more about her.	Jupajj jupat jukʼamp yatiñwa munäna.
I can understand why this happens.	Kunatsa ukham pasaspa uk sum amuyta.
I think you know better than that.	Nayax amuyta jumax yatisktawa ukat sipan juk’amp suma.
But the place agreed.	Ukampis uka cheq iyaw sänwa.
It’s never going to happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Or there was something.	Jan ukajj kunas utjäna.
But on the other hand.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa.
After three years there, he returned home.	Kimsa mara ukan qhepatjja, wasitatwa utar kuttʼjjäna.
Good but not great film.	Suma ukampis janiw jach’a película.
There may be some truth to this.	Uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa chiqaw utjaspa.
But I love him so much.	Ukampis jupat walpun munasta.
I don't think it matters who or why.	Khitis jan ukajj kunatsa ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw amuyta.
In fact, we have both and.	Chiqansa, jiwasax panpachaniw ukat...
Now they usually go there every other day.	Jichhax sapa pä uruw ukar sarañ yatipxi.
He saw what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk uñjäna.

I love this room so much.	Nayax aka cuarto ukarux walpun munasta.
But it really happened.	Ukampis cheqapuniw ukham pasäna.
That was the case for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
One more thing needs to be done.	Mä juk’ampi lurañaw wakisi.
He didn't want to see her.	Jupajj janiw jupar uñjañ munkänti.
I heard it coming out this morning.	Jichha alwajj mistuñ istʼta.
There is nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
It’s the same power.	Ukax pachpa ch’amawa.
It remained strong.	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw qheparäna.
So far he’s doing really well.	Jichhakamax jupax chiqpachapuniw wali sum luraski.
Couldn’t go twice.	Janiw pä kuti sarañ puedkänti.

This may take longer.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
And, honestly, it still wasn’t.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, waliw jan ukhamäkänti.
Someone going somewhere, doing something.	Maynix kawkirus saraski, kuns luraski.
When he left.	Kunapachatï jupax sarxäna ukhaxa.
He finally found himself, his true self.	Jupax qhipharux jupa pachpaw jikxatasïna, chiqpach jupa pachpa.
In fact, you will be happier.	Chiqansa, jumax jukʼamp kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
He knows that very well.	Jupajj uk sum yatta.
The answer is:	Ukajj akham siwa:
But he was happier with himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpat jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He is unbearable.	Jupajj janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
He didn't know where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk janiw yatkänti.
I let him do it.	Nayax uk lurañapatakiw jaytawayta.
So far everything is fine.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
It’s pretty simple because why.	Ukax wali ch’amawa kunatix kunatsa.
But I don’t know how.	Ukampis janiw kunjamatsa uk yatkti.
I think he’s right.	Nayax jupax chiqaw sasaw amuyta.
But this looks really cool.	Ukampis akax chiqpachansa wali suma uñtatawa.
Of course, you can do this a few hours in advance.	Chiqansa, mä qhawqha horanak nayraw uk lurasma.
He called her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jawsäna.
No one knows why or how.	Kunatsa jan ukajj kunjamsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Did you know that it exists.	¿Ukax utji uk yattati.
And he knew how.	Ukat kunjamsa uk yatïna.
But doing many things well is difficult.	Ukampis walja lurañanak sum lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
I don’t want anything.	Janiw kuns munkti.
In this case he will do exactly that.	Uka tuqitxa jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurani.
I realize it every day.	Sapa uruw uk amuyasta.
Today, he has two jobs in mind.	Jichhürunakanjja, pä trabajo lurañwa amti.
But that is even more important today.	Ukampis ukajj jichhürunakan jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
And that was about it.	Ukat ukajj uka toqetwa parläna.
And now that’s okay.	Ukat jichhax ukax walikïskiwa.

She thought that could be him.	Ukaw jupajj utjaspa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Finally, he spoke again.	Qhepatjja, wasitatwa parläna.
As if this year doesn’t know.	Kunjamsa aka marax jan yatkaspa ukhama.

That’s not all that good.	Ukax janiw taqpach askïkiti.
No one here would do that.	Janiw khitis akan ukham lurkaspänti.
He won't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkaniti.
He needs to do more and more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jukʼamp lurañapa.

And another one.	Ukat yaqha.
And everywhere else.	Ukat taqi chiqansa.

Why, he didn't know.	Kunatsa, janiw yatkänti.

Of course, that doesn't matter.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw kunäkisa.

Not even about the cold.	Janiw uka thaya tuqitsa.
Or anyone else.	Jan ukajj khitis.
I can’t say I personally understand him.	Naya pachpaw jupar sum amuyasta sasin janiw siskti.

And it was for a while.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempojj ukhamänwa.
But it wasn't what he had planned.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï amtkäna ukhamäkänti.
But it can be really useful.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali askïspawa.
All of these are important.	Taqe ukanakajj wali wakiskiriwa.

I was really excited about it, actually.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, chiqpachansa.

He needed to do the same thing.	Jupajj mä pachpa lurañaw wakisïna.

I don’t think I can do more than that.	Nayax janiw ukat sipan juk’amp lurañax utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.

That was about a decade ago.	Ukajj niya tunka mara nayraw pasäna.
Or at least it’s not entirely true.	Jan ukax mä juk’a pachax janiw taqpach chiqaw sañ munkiti.

Of course that’s a good thing.	Chiqansa ukax wali askiwa.
Now I don't know exactly what happened.	Jichhajj kunas ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I come from a different direction.	Nayax yaqha tuqit jutta.
It's not how long you can do something, it's how often you do it.	Janiw qhawqha tiempos kuns lurasma uk sañ munkiti, jan ukasti qhawqha kutis lurasma.
He didn't know exactly what time it was.	Jupajj janiw kuna horasas uk sum yatkänti.

Things are not like that.	Kunanakas janiw ukhamäkiti.

He didn't want to do it himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
He said he thought it could be done.	Jupax lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyta sasaw säna.
I don’t have regular time.	Nayatakix janiw sapa kuti tiempox utjkiti.

Of course he doesn’t know.	Chiqansa jupax janiw yatkiti.

But he didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
But he doesn't do such things.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañanak lurkiti.
And more importantly.	Ukat jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
I’m pretty excited about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But maybe he would have.	Ukampis inas jupajj ukham luraspäna.

Today is the day to make a decision.	Jichhüruw mä amtar puriñ urux purini.

That’s what did it.	Ukaw kuns luräna.
But yeah, never really had a chance.	Ukampis jïsa, janipuniw chiqpachansa mä oportunidad utjkänti.

Well, that’s it, of course.	Ukhama, ukaxa, chiqpachansa.

So let's see how that goes.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa ukajj pasaski uk uñjañäni.
If you want, of course.	Jumax munsta ukhaxa, chiqpachansa.

I don’t remember walking anyone.	Janiw khitirus sarnaqañ amtaskti.
He couldn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.
He didn't believe it.	Jupajj janiw iyaw siskänti.
He needed help and immediately.	Jupajj yanaptʼa ukat jankʼakiw munasïna.
I know who he is.	Nayajj khitïnsa uk yattwa.
I appreciate that very much.	Ukjja wali askit uñjta.
He didn't know that fact.	Jupajj janiw uka cheq yatkänti.
He is a stupid guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa.
Often snowy in winter.	Juyphi pachanx walja kutiw ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He thought it was funny.	Jupax wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyäna.
I think this is wrong.	Nayax amuyta akax janiw walïkiti.
But how we do this is important.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk lurañäni ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
That wasn't a yes.	Ukajj janiw jïsa sañ munkänti.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luratayna.
In this case it is not.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He stayed there.	Jupajj ukan qheparäna.
Not once in a while.	Janiw mä kutis utjkiti.
He is a teacher.	Jupax mä yatichiriwa.
Not really able to do it yet.	Janiw chiqpachapunix jichhakamax lurañjamäkiti.
I’m just saying that.	Nayax ukhamakiw sista.
Money, for one thing.	Qullqi, mä tuqitxa.
Well, I want to say something else.	Ukhama, yaqha tuqit arsuñ munta.
He got it from you.	Jupajj jumat uk katoqäna.
I like what he’s doing.	Kuntï jupax luraski ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He knows he could have done it.	Jupajj uk luraspäna uk sum yati.
He just said how he felt about me at the time.	Jupajj kunjamsa uka tiempon nayat jikjjatasïna ukakiw säna.
He really knows all about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw taqe ukanak yati.
But it is more important than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
It was very nice as well.	Wali sumawa ukhamaraki.
For me, that is not the case.	Nayatakejj ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
We'll see that.	Jiwasajj uk uñjañäni.
Things get really weird, really fast.	Kunanakas chiqpachansa muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa jank’akiw puri.
I don’t remember where it came from.	Janiw kawkitsa jutäna uk amtaskti.
Today, I feel very sad.	Jichhürunakanjja, wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
Thank me you know.	Nayaruw yuspärta jumax yatta.

He knew he had no choice.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti uk sum yatïna.
The real kind.	Chiqpach kasta.
You don’t want to go.	Jumax janiw sarañ munktati.
At this point, you can’t have that guy.	Aka pachanx janiw uka waynax utjkaspati.
Not probably about that.	Janiw inas uka tuqitxa.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't need one.	Janiw kunas walïkiti, janiw mä jukʼa munaskiti.
He didn't need to.	Jupajj janiw wakiskänti.
We can’t believe it.	Jiwasax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He said it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa ukham säna.

Let’s take a look at what might be interesting.	Kunanakas wali askïspa uk uñjañäni.
I don't know about myself.	Nayajj janiw nayat yatkti.
Don't forget!.	¡Jan armasimti!.
Things weren’t clear.	Kunanakas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
Things went well.	Kunas wali sum saräna.
Maybe someone worse.	Inas maynix juk’amp jan wali.
And, yes, it’s worth it.	Ukat, jïsa, wali askiwa.
Alternatively, if necessary.	Yaqha tuqitxa, wakisispa ukhaxa.
He arrived on the morning of that actual day.	Jupajj uka cheqpach uru alwaw purinïna.
Not a thing.	Janiw mä kuna.
There was never enough money.	Janipuniw qullqix utjkänti.
That’s because it is.	Ukax kunatix ukhamawa.
Do it quickly and easily.	Jankʼakiw uk luram.
He couldn't take his eyes off her.	Jupajj janiw nayranakap jupat apsuñ puedkänti.
I know what he thinks.	Kuntï jupajj amuyki uk sum yatta.
I don’t like that.	Janiw ukax gustkiti.
These are very important to me.	Ukanakajj nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
So it happened many times.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
So what is the value? 	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa?
Almost nothing to do .	Niya janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti .
He really couldn’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.
I like everything about him.	Jupat taqe kunas nayatakejj wali askiwa.
That’s what he is.	Ukhamaw jupax ukhama.
I guess it doesn’t matter.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukax kunäkisa.
I just don’t want to.	Nayax ukhamakiw jan munkti.
He knew what he had to do.	Jupajj kunas lurañapa uk sum yatïna.
Something he didn’t want to do in me.	Kunas nayan jan lurañ munkänti.
I’m not saying it.	Janiw nayax siskti.
It was both sides of the coin.	Ukajj panpachaniw utjäna.
You know the rules.	Jumax kamachinak yatisktawa.
I think you’re right.	Nayax jumax chiqaw sasaw amuyta.
There was something there.	Ukanjja kunas utjäna.
But he likes it there.	Ukampis ukanjja jupajj wal gusti.
So he did it.	Ukatwa jupajj luräna.
Everything was a lot of fun.	Taqi kunas wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Everyone knows that.	Taqinipuniw uk yatipxi.
This will obviously take some time.	Ukatakejj mä qhawqha tiempow munasini, ukajj qhanawa.
Of course, it wasn’t for me.	Chiqansa, janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
Or I am still depressed.	Jan ukajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
He did as he pleased.	Jupajj kunjamtï munkäna ukhamwa luräna.
Everyone is today.	Taqinipuniw jichhürunakanx utji.
I’ve been waiting for thirty years.	Nayax kimsa tunk maraw suyt’askta.
The way he did it was unique.	Kunjamtï lurkäna ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
I don’t want to leave you.	Janiw jumar jaytañ munkti.
You may not know that.	Inas jan uk yatkayätati.
But it's not there.	Ukampis janiw ukanjja.
He thought it was a good thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
He fell in love immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw munasïna.
I don't know exactly what he's doing.	Taqe kuntï luraski uk janiw sum yatkti.
He threw it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jaqontäna.
He knows what happened to me.	Kunas nayar pasäna uk jupajj sum yati.
It’s pretty cool as well.	Ukax wali ch’amawa ukhamaraki.
Or is it him?.	Jan ukajj ¿jupajj?.
He was still watching.	Jupajj wali uñchʼukiskäna.
In fact, he never noticed.	Chiqansa, janipuniw kuns amuyaskänti.
But now there was none.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw utjkänti.
After he left, the issue began again.	Jupajj sarjjäna uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa uka jan waltʼäwejj qalltäna.
Things were really good.	Kunanakas chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
We are good, lots of good.	Jiwasax wali sumawa, walja sumawa.
He has to do what he says.	Kuntï siskäna ukjja, jupa pachpaw lurañapa.
He didn't know anywhere.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus yatkänti.
Why is that all?.	¿Kunatsa ukax taqi kunas?.
That's a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
It is much more exciting.	Ukajj jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
I think we are too.	Nayax amuyta, jiwasax ukhamaraki.
I hope to see you there.	Ukan uñjañ suytʼaskta.
It doesn’t take long.	Janiw jaya tiempox munaskiti.
Much more of course.	Walja juk’ampi chiqpachansa.
Maybe one or two more, at least.	Inas mä jan ukax pä juk’ampi, juk’ampi.
Well, maybe one.	Ukhama, inas mä.
No one loves him.	Janiw khitis jupar munaskiti.
I want another chance.	Nayax yaqha ch’am munta.
No, it still feels good.	Janiwa, wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He would never have done that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.
Now I plan to take a closer look at that.	Jichhax uka tuqit sum uñjañ amtasta.
It is not what he thinks it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj amuyki ukajj ukhamäkiti.
It’s still a great place to be.	Wali jach’a uñtatawa.
He doesn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham gustkiti.
I didn’t say anything to anyone.	Janiw khitirus kuns siskti.
It was a really nice day.	Chiqpachansa uka urux wali sumapunïnwa.

He had seen her before.	Jupajj nayraw jupar uñjäna.
I understand what it could be.	Kunas ukajj utjaspa uk sum amuyta.
Will definitely be doing this again.	Chiqpachansa aka wasitat lurañaw utjani.
Maybe it’s worth it.	Inas ukax wakischispa.
He started drinking too much.	Jupajj sinti umañ qalltäna.
He felt sad.	Jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He started drinking.	Jupax umañ qalltäna.
I can say no more.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp siskti.
You feel comfortable and you feel good.	Jumax wali sumaw jikxatastaxa ukat wali sum jikxatastaxa.
Many many many.	Walja walja walja.
If you do that.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja.
I want to eat them.	Nayax jupanakar manq’añ munta.
Of course he never does.	Chiqansa jupax janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
He didn't know how or where it started.	Kunjamsa ni kawkhansa qalltäna uk janiw yatkänti.
There was never anything.	Janipuniw kunas utjkänti.
So it was a very nice experience.	Ukhamajj wali sumapunïnwa.
I never believed it.	Janipuniw nayajj creykti.
No one wants the truth.	Janiw khitis kunatï cheqäki uk munkiti.
Don’t do that again.	Janiw mayamp ukham luramti.
How do you guys.	Kunjamsa jumax.
No one said anything.	Janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
But he looked a little lonely.	Ukampis mä jukʼa sapakiw uñnaqäna.
I love him very, very much.	Nayax juparux wali, walpun munasta.
Yes, he wanted more than that.	Jïsa, ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munäna.
So looking forward to seeing you!.	¡Ukhamajj jumar uñjañ suytʼaskta!.
It doesn’t do that.	Janiw uk lurkiti.
He certainly did it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk luräna.
That is one of them.	Ukajj ukanakat maynïriwa.
He lives on his own.	Jupa pachpaw jakasi.
He couldn't stay much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempo qheparañ puedkänti.
It was a time he loved her the most.	Mä pachaw jupax juparux juk’amp munasïna.
Later in October.	Octubre phaxsinx qhipürux.
I know it’s good, though.	Nayax yattwa ukax wali askiwa, ukampis.
So he did something.	Ukatwa jupajj kuns luratayna.
I don’t think anyone can do that.	Nayax janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
It was very clear to me.	Nayatakix wali qhanaw utjäna.
I watched him do something.	Nayax juparux kuns luraskäna uk uñjta.
That will require more work.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp lurañaw wakisini.
Anything is better than nothing.	Kuna lurañas jan lurañat sipansa juk’amp askiwa.
I’m happy here.	Nayax akan kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He doesn’t know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkiti.
He could always do better.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp sum luraspäna.
It felt like he knew it.	Ukajj jupajj sum yatïna ukham jikjjatasïna.
That doesn’t work anymore.	Ukax janiw juk’amp irnaqkiti.
That wasn’t the case that day.	Uka urux janiw ukhamäkänti.
Well now not anymore.	Suma jichhax janiw juk’ampi.
No one does it better.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp sum lurkiti.
So I said no to it.	Ukatwa nayajj janiw sasaw sista.
He wanted small pictures.	Jupax jisk’a fotonak munäna.
I don’t want to work anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha chiqan irnaqañ munkti.
When you do that, it’s beautiful.	Ukham lurasax wali sumawa.
You are a teacher.	Jumax yatichiriwa.
Yes, of course, if you like.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa, jumax munsta ukhaxa.
Well actually.	Wali chiqpachansa.
I never understood them.	Janipuniw jupanakar amuykayätti.
So we have to do something.	Ukatwa jiwasajj kuns lurañasa.
Do those two things.	Uka pä yänak luram.
And this takes all too long.	Ukat akax taqpach sinti jaya pachaw munasispa.
He never mentioned it .	Jupajj janipuniw uka toqet arskänti .
There is no one like him.	Janiw khitis jupar uñtasit utjkiti.
I don't understand it any better than you do.	Nayajj janiw jumat sipansa jukʼamp sum amuykti.
He never meant to say that.	Janipuniw ukham sañ munkänti.
I gave him some water.	Nayaw jupar mä jukʼa uma churta.
I don’t like that.	Nayax janiw ukax askïkiti.
We don't need that.	Jiwasajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But there is no way to do that.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He wants to fall asleep now.	Jichhax ikiñar puriñ muni.
Of course, you’ll have a great time here.	Chiqansa, jumax aka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatasïta.
It’s kind of .	Ukax mä kasta .
He didn't want to walk.	Janiw sarnaqañ munkänti.
And the sooner he does that, the better.	Ukat uk jankʼak luraspa ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
We are not worth anything.	Jiwasajj janiw kunäkisa.
Very quiet as well.	Wali amukiw ukhamaraki.
But interestingly this is not the case.	Ukampis wali muspharkañawa akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
What you are saying.	Kuntï jumajj siskta uk.
I don’t do that well.	Janiw nayax ukham sum lurkti.
They don’t know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatipkiti.
I didn't want to talk to anyone at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw khitimpis parltʼañ munkayätti.
He knew what he was doing.	Kuntï luraskäna uk sum yatïna.
I never did it myself.	Naya pachpajj janipuniw uk lurkti.
What did he do.	Kunsa jupajj luräna.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis ukajj lurañaw wakisi.
That was the first thing that surprised him.	Ukaw nayraqat jupar muspharäna.
It’s becoming more and more popular.	Ukax juk’amp juk’amp uñt’atawa.
But this is one time I really wanted to know.	Ukampis akax mä kutix chiqpachapuniw yatiñ munäna.
I can't believe he would do that to me.	Jupajj nayar ukham luraspäna uk janiw creykti.
Let me know what you think!.	¡Kuns jumax amuyta uk yatiyapxita!.
He’s never like that.	Jupax janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
You don’t have to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.
I’m still feeling it.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw ukham jikxatastxa.
I will never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti.
But I can’t do it right.	Ukampis janiw sum lurirjamäkti.
He’s going to be with me.	Jupax nayamp chikaw sarxani.

But you know how it goes.	Ukampis kunjamsa ukajj pasaski uk jumajj yatisktawa.
For me this first time.	Nayatakix aka nayrïr kutix.
Well, so beautiful.	Ukhama, ukhama suma.
Which is exactly why he’s not really here.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunatix jupax janiw chiqpachans akan utjkiti.
I wasn't sure if that was right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
You have to do it yourself, you know.	Jumax juma pachpaw lurañama, jumax yatisktawa.
He finally realized.	Jupajj qhepatwa amuyasïna.
Tell us about the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwit yatiyapjjeta.
This time is coming soon.	Aka pachax niyaw purini.
But somewhat surprisingly, this is not the case.	Ukampis mä jukʼa muspharkañawa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s all there cool.	Jupax taqiniw ukan thaya.
She reported the crime to the local police the next day.	Ukat qhipürux uka markankir policiaruw uka jan wali luratapat yatiyäna.
None of you are anyone.	Janiw khitis jumanakat khitis utjkiti.
He stayed there for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukan qheparäna.
I didn't want much.	Janiw walpun munkayätti.
You know, just do it.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukhamakiw lurañama.
Rather, he has a long-term view.	Jan ukasti, jupax jaya pachaw uñji.
There is some truth to this, and that is not a problem.	Uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa chiqaw utji, ukat ukax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.

I didn't want to talk to him.	Nayajj janiw jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
Of course, he did.	Chiqansa, jupaw ukham luräna.
But he wanted to do one thing alone.	Ukampis mä sapak lurañwa munäna.
That’s what made him like that.	Ukaw jupar ukham luräna.
That was all I understood.	Ukaw taqe kunas amuyasïna.
The man spoke again.	Uka jaqejj wasitatwa parläna.
There is no such thing.	Ukax janiw utjkiti.
Rather than as.	Jan ukasti kunjamtï.
That’s because there isn’t one.	Ukax kunatix janiw mä utjkiti.
I do not know what the future holds for me.	Jutïrin kunas nayatakejj utjani uk janiw yatkti.
I feel better about myself now.	Jichhajj naya pachpaw wali sum jikjjatasta.

But it really doesn’t matter.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He’s at it again.	Jupax wasitatwa ukan jikxatasi.
That will have to be done.	Ukajj lurañaw wakisini.
But I can't figure out how to do it.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk lurañax uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
He can do anything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa luraspa.
Well, ‘what happens’ jaya.	Suma, ‘kunas pasaspa’ jaya.
I didn’t think anyone would.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati sasin amuykayätti.

Now things are fine.	Jichhajj kunas walikïskiwa.
He was happy to go for it.	Wali kusisitaw ukatakejj saräna.

I don’t know what’s in there.	Janiw kunas ukan utji uk yatkti.

Don't forget what you think.	Kuntï jumajj amuykta uk jan armasimti.

There is no money to do the things we do.	Kunanaktï lurapkta ukanak lurañatakix janiw qullqix utjkiti.

And no one needed it.	Ukat janiw khitis wakiskänti.

Except it doesn’t have to be done.	Jan ukasti janiw lurañax wakiskiti.

Not so a couple of years ago.	Mä pä mara nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.

There was no breakfast.	Janiw desayuno ukax utjkänti.
After those days.	Uka urunak qhepatjja.

Of course, this was always the case.	Chiqansa, ukax sapa kutiw utjäna.

He took it out the day before.	Jupajj mä uru nayraw ukanak apsüna.
But twice it wasn’t enough.	Ukampis pä kutiw janiw wakiskänti.
He refused to go to the hospital.	Jupajj janiw hospitalar sarañ munkänti.

You can do the same here.	Aka chiqanx ukhamarakiw lurasma.
I heard the message again.	Uka yatiyäw wasitat istʼta.
He wants to do that too.	Uk lurañas jupajj muni.
But he's a great guy.	Ukampis jupax wali jach'a jaqiwa.
This will take hours.	Ukatakejj walja horanakaw munasini.
Cold word, so.	Thaya aru, ukhama.
Yes, he was very good at it.	Jïsa, jupajj uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
It went really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw saräna.
Or he could have done something.	Jan ukajj kuns luraspänwa.
The weather here isn’t bad.	Aka chiqanx pachax janiw jan walïkiti.

Warm water in winter.	Juyphi pachanx junt’u uma.
This was rare.	Ukajj janiw sinti utjkänti.
But he didn't like her.	Ukampis jupajj janiw jupar gustkänti.
He’s always felt that way.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukham jikxatasïna.
I don't remember anything there.	Ukanjja janiw kunsa amtaskti.
He told himself that he would do it later.	Ukat qhepatwa uk lurä sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
But there’s no future, not really.	Ukampis janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti, janiw chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
I’m sad here.	Nayax akan llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I didn't know when or how it would happen.	Kunapachas ni kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkayätti.
But that’s not often the case.	Ukampis janiw walja kutix ukhamäkiti.
I know what is wrong with you.	Nayajj yattwa kunas juman jan walïki ukjja.
And he never does, though.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkiti, ukampis.
And he didn't know what to do.	Ukat janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
I didn't do anything. 	Nayajj janiw kuns lurkti. 
He told me everything.	Jupaw taqe kun yatiyäna.
But he had to do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
Two years, maybe three.	Pä mara, inas kimsa mara.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
And I’m about that.	Ukat nayax uka tuqitxa.
Not much later.	Janiw jukʼamp qhepat ukhamäkiti.
There was no way he could do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurkaspänti.

That means pretty much everyone.	Ukax niya taqiniw sañ muni.
In fact, it isn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

But he is still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
And finally he spoke.	Ukat qhepatjja, jupajj parläna.
He would make food for anything and nothing.	Jupajj kunatsa ukat janiw kunatsa manqʼa luraspäna.
He didn't know what he would do.	Ukham lurasajj kunsa lurani uk janiw yatkänti.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ukajj pasañap yatiyätwa.
But he didn't think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuykänti.
It was a wonderful thing to do, he said himself.	Uka lurañajj wali sumapunïnwa, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
It will definitely rain again tomorrow.	Chiqpachansa qhipürux wasitat jallu purini.
And you know what, it’s good.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa kunas, ukax wali askiwa.
We’re still worth it.	Jiwasax wali askiwa.

I don’t really want to take things out.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix yänak apsuñ munkti.
And that takes years.	Ukat ukatakix walja maranakaw munasispa.
Let’s see what he does.	Kunsa luraski uk uñjañäni.
Fortunately, there is something to be done.	Wali askiwa, kuna lurañas utji.
Something happened, happened.	Kunas pasäna, pasäna.
He doesn't know that we do.	Jupajj janiw jiwasajj uk yatkiti.
I was really like that.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukhamänwa.
No one knows what’s going to happen tomorrow, ever.	Janiw khitis yatkiti kunas qharürux pasani, janipuniw.
I want to be real with you.	Nayax jumamp chika chiqpach sarnaqañ munta.

Half of it is far away.	Chikat wali jaya.
I want to know what’s going on here.	Kunas akan utji uk yatiñ munta.
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis janiw uk siskänti.
I want to know why.	Kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
He talked to her .	Jupampiw parläna .
Because that’s what it’s worth.	Kunatix ukax wali askiwa.
Do this several times a day.	Uka urux walja kutiw ukham lurañama.

It happened twice, which is very rare.	Pä kutiw ukham pasäna, ukajj wali jukʼakiw utji.
The old and the new will be here.	Nayra ukat machaq ukanakax akanx utjani.
He asked if they were safe to eat.	Jupanakajj manqʼañatakejj walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼitäna.

But he knew that was it.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I've seen him.	Nayajj jupar uñjta.
I didn't know how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw yatkayätti.
I’ve never had a time like this.	Janipuniw ukham pachax utjkitänti.
That’s fine, the man said.	Ukax walikïskiwa, sasaw uka jaqix säna.
I don’t think you can afford it.	Nayax janiw uka qullqix utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
That's how good he was.	Ukhamaw jupajj wali suma jaqënwa.
So there’s something there.	Ukhamajj kunas ukan utji.
But that doesn't seem to work.	Ukampis janiw ukajj askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
But let’s see.	Ukampis uñjañäni.
There's nothing more to it.	Janiw juk'ampi kunas utjkiti.
They’re beautiful, actually.	Jupanakax wali sumawa, chiqpachansa.
And it’s not a good thing.	Ukat janiw walïkiti.
I’m a little disappointed.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He was a very rich man.	Jupajj wali qamir jaqënwa.
Nowhere, I don’t want to be honest.	Janiw kawkinsa, cheq parlañ munkti.
I don’t know the words.	Nayax janiw uka arunak uñt’kti.
He really loves her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar munasi.
I want to make that decision.	Nayax uka amtar puriñ munta.
I liked this a lot.	Nayax akax walpun gustitu.
Of course you can't do that.	Chiqansa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It looks really great.	Chiqpachansa jach’a uñtatawa.
I loved that so much.	Nayajj uk walpun munta.
Because that’s where the money is.	Kunatix uka chiqan qullqix utji.
It doesn’t work .	Ukax janiw irnaqkiti .
I don’t want to say that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkti.
This time it’s not.	Jichha kutin janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s going straight.	Jupax chiqaw saraski.
He was the one who spoke.	Jupaw parläna.
Not once did she wish him any harm.	Janiw mä kutis jupar jan walinak munkänti.
He barely noticed it.	Jupajj jukʼakiw uk amuyasïna.
So someone did that.	Ukhamajj mayniw ukham luräna.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
It won’t last long.	Janiw jaya pachax utjkaniti.
It was the best thing that ever happened.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
I don’t know who did it.	Khitis uk luräna uk janiw yatkti.
I made a little book.	Nayajj mä jiskʼa libro lurayäta.

You’ll be really excited.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
Or even bigger.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp jachʼa.
You’re the first person who knows anything about him.	Jumax nayrïr jaqiwa, jupax jupat kuns yati.

He didn't mean them, he told himself.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar sañ munkänti, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
You’ll tell them.	Jumaw jupanakar yatiyäta.
He knows everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa yati.
Everything is quiet in the morning.	Taqi kunas alwax amukiw jikxatasi.
I'm so worried right now.	Jichhakiw wal llakista.
He came several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jutäna.
But then and therefore.	Ukampis ukat ukatwa.
A beautiful eye.	Mä suma nayra.

But it is important to me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
Right in this house.	Chiqaw aka utan.

I certainly don’t.	Nayax chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
Because you’ll get it soon.	Kunatix jumax jank’akiw jikxatasïta.
Not really, of course.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I think this is the best time.	Nayax aka pachax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
He got three years for that.	Ukatakejj kimsa maraw katoqäna.
He was in awe of her.	Jupajj jupar wal muspharäna.
That's the way it is.	Ukajj ukhamawa.
Not without seeing them first hand.	Janiw jupanakar nayraqat jan uñjasajj ukhamäkiti.
I had it for breakfast.	Nayax desayuno lurañatakiw utjäna.
But it’s what’s happening.	Ukampis kunas pasaski ukawa.
I want him here now.	Nayax juparux jichhax akan munta.
He was immediately available.	Jupajj jankʼakiw utjäna.
It’s a really great character.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a jaqiwa.
And he didn’t want anything else.	Ukat janiw yaqha munkänti.
He looks very good.	Jupax wali suma uñnaqaniwa.
He does not do these things in secret.	Jupajj janiw ukanak jamasat lurkiti.
Many thanks in advance.	Walja kutiw nayraqat yuspärta.
He shook the snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’allxtayäna.

You know it doesn’t work that way.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
Very cold.	Sinti thaya.

You’ve got a lot of power.	Jumax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïta.
There is nothing to make time for.	Janiw kunas tiempo lurañatakix utjkiti.

He knew exactly why.	Jupax kunatsa uk sum yatïna.

That’s what it looks like.	Ukhamaw ukax uñtasi.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kuntix munki uk luraspa.
You just had to tell me a little bit about you.	Jumax jichhakiw jumat mä juk’a yatiyañama.

You’re an adult.	Jumax jilïr jaqïtawa.

Is it necessary to do so.	¿Ukham lurañajj wakisispati.
He gave me the gift.	Jupaw nayar churitu.
But it’s not about that.	Ukampis janiw uka tuqitxa.
So that's about everything.	Ukhamajj ukajj taqe kunaw sañ muni.
It’s a little bit more difficult.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amawa.
I couldn't understand why he didn't.	Kunatsa jan ukham lurkäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
I like him a lot.	Nayax juparux walpun munta.

Individuals do not exist.	Sapa maynix janiw utjkiti.
He doesn’t know what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw yatkiti.
He’d never done that before, he didn’t know all about it.	Jupax janiw kunapachas ukham lurañ yatkänti, janiw taqpach yatkänti.
He told me he didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkti sasaw sitäna.
He goes very fast and has no trouble.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw saraski ukat janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Great little ones.	Jach’a jisk’a.

Of course he didn’t know.	Chiqansa jupax janiw yatkänti.

Of course that is not a good thing.	Chiqansa ukax janiw walïkiti.
How much money is in the market.	Qhawqha qullqis markar puri.

Would you like to know more about it?.	¿Jumax uka tuqit juk’amp yatxatañ munasmati?.

But I really want to do that.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj walpun munta.
He didn't say anything for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan kuns arskänti.
He’s always like that.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukhama.
The school didn’t know what to do with him.	Yatiqañ utax janiw kuns jupamp lurañap yatkänti.

And if you want to do that.	Ukat jumax ukham lurañ munsta ukhaxa.

He called the police.	Policiaruw jawsäna.
But that’s important, he says.	Ukampis ukax wali wakiskiriwa, sasaw saraki.

And there is nowhere to go.	Ukat janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkiti.
That’s what reached me.	Ukaw nayar puri.
No one knew about you.	Janiw khitis jumat yatkänti.
Now that is very important.	Jichhajj ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
You’re about this.	Jumax aka tuqitxa.
I almost understand what you are saying.	Kuntï jumajj siskta uk niyaw amuyasta.
I’m going to be alone.	Naya sapakiw saraskta.
So there are two things.	Ukhamajj pä kunaw utji.
And so yeah.	Ukat ukhamajj jïsa.
He’s been pretty quiet lately.	Jupax aka qhipa urunakanx wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
A better one, too.	Mä juk’amp suma, ukhamaraki.
He could not sleep .	Jupajj janiw ikiñ puedkänti .
I don't know exactly.	Janiw sum siskti.
Actually, no, it’s very difficult.	Chiqansa, janiwa, wali ch’amawa.
But that just happened.	Ukampis ukajj jichhakiw pasäna.
He knew the door.	Jupajj uka punku sum yatïna.
He doesn't understand anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns amuykiti.
Of course, he can do that.	Chiqansa, jupax ukham luraspa.
He couldn't do it.	Jupajj janiw puedkänti.
He loves her so much.	Jupajj jupar wal munasi.
So finally he went off on his own.	Ukhamajj qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw sarjjäna.
I don’t go with anyone.	Janiw khitimpis sarkti.
I am so happy for these.	Nayajj ukanak laykojj wal kusista.
I think it would be good for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali askïspawa.
He was doing a lot.	Jupajj walpun luraskäna.
He’s cruel and mean.	Jupax qhuru ukat jan wali jaqiwa.
That was the last thing he said.	Ukaw qhep qhepa arsüna.
He says he can’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti sasaw saraki.
It’s very unusual.	Ukax wali jan uñt’atawa.
Still unbelievable.	Wali jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
There is also a .	Ukhamarakiw .
Please tell us more about it.	Uka tuqit jukʼamp yatiyapxita.
You are a human being.	Jumax mä jaqiwa.
I understand how much I love the whole person.	Kunjamsa taqpach jaqir munasta uk sum amuyta.
I couldn't think of anything.	Janiw kuns amuytʼirjamäkti.
I want to get out more.	Nayax juk’amp mistuñ munta.
Sorry, she replied.	Perdón, sasaw jupajj säna.
It felt good this morning.	Jichha alwajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
I love seeing you out.	Nayax jumanakar mistuñ uñjañ walpun munta.
So it doesn't exist.	Ukhamajj janiw utjkiti.
I don’t want to see him again.	Janiw wasitat jupar uñjañ munkti.
This was not the case here.	Aka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkänti.
He never wanted that to happen again.	Jupajj janipuniw mayamps ukham pasañap munkänti.
And then he started to walk away.	Ukat ukat sarxañ qalltäna.
He didn't have to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañap wakiskänti.
I’m a little bit.	Nayax mä juk’a.
But let me know what you think!.	Ukampis ¡kunsa amuyta uk yatiyapxita!.
A really great house.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a uta.
He repeated it several times.	Walja kutiw uk wasitat arsüna.
I’ve never seen that kind of behavior.	Janipuniw ukham sarnaqañ uñjkti.
They know how to use it.	Jupanakax kunjams apnaqañ yatipxi.
Nothing like that really happens.	Janiw kunas ukham chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
You have to do better.	Jumaw jukʼamp sum lurañama.
It may take longer than you think.	Inas jumax amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
He told her to.	Jupajj jupar sänwa.
I want to come early.	Nayratpach jutañ munta.
Nothing for you here.	Janiw kunas jumatakix akan utjkiti.
But the young man did not realize it.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw uk amuyaskänti.
They know how to do it.	Jupanakax lurañ yatipxi.
He knew what was happening, he didn't care.	Kunatï paskäna uk sum yatïna, janiw kuns lurkänti.
He’s saying something.	Jupax kuns siwa.
That had nothing to do with me.	Ukajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Rather, it is what he did.	Jan ukasti kuntï lurkäna ukawa.
Of course, no one really knows.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkiti.
But he has a thing for me.	Ukampis jupajj nayatak mä kunaw utji.
He took it all off.	Jupajj taqe ukanak apsüna.
A few days maybe.	Mä qawqha urunak inas.
This is an important step.	Uka lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
I’ve been there several times recently.	Jichhakiw walja kutiw ukar sarawayta.
It was almost time.	Niya tiempow sarjjäna.
I’m so happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw akanktxa.
He knew something.	Jupax kuns yatïna.
I want to do something amazing.	Nayax mä muspharkañ lurañ munta.
He did everything he was supposed to do.	Jupajj taqe kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luräna.
Not a brother.	Janiw mä jila.
Maybe something is happening.	Inas kunas pasaspa.
He knew what he was doing.	Jupajj kuntï luraskäna uk sum yatïna.
I gave him everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa jupar churta.
It didn’t seem like it was worth it, somehow.	Janiw ukax askïkaspas ukhamäkänti, kunjamatsa.
He has to go himself.	Jupa pachpaw sarañapa.
I didn’t understand him.	Janiw jupar sum amuykayätti.
I understood what he was saying.	Jupan kuntï siskäna uk sum amuyayäta.
Well not any more.	Suma janiw juk’ampi.
It looks great to me.	Nayatakix wali suma uñtatawa.
He’s a young man.	Jupax mä waynawa.
I really hope to do it again.	Nayax wasitat chiqpachapuniw lurañ suyt’askta.
Or it is not necessary.	Jan ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
I don’t really care.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix kuns lurkti.
And that only happened once.	Ukat ukajj mä kutikiw pasäna.
There’s something there.	Ukanx kunas utji.
A pretty long one.	Mä suma jaya.
But no, he isn't.	Ukampis janiw, janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
We need to do better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurañasa.
As he happened to be.	Kunjamtï jupajj paskäna ukhama.
A couple of days later, it was.	Mä pä urunak qhepatjja, ukhamänwa.
Nothing has worked so far.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
I want to know how and why and when.	Kunjamsa ukat kunatsa ukat kunapachas uk yatiñ munta.
And no, that’s not the case.	Ukat janiw, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And herself.	Ukat jupa pachpa.
I want to know how to do this properly.	Kunjamsa uk sum lurañax uk yatiñ munta.
Or he didn't mean it.	Jan ukajj janiw sañ munkänti.
He will do what is right.	Jupajj kunatï walïki uk lurani.
I didn’t want to tell you anything about myself.	Janiw naya pachpat kuns yatiyañ munkayätti.
Good and better.	Suma ukat juk’amp suma.
More, more, he said.	Juk’ampi, juk’ampi, sasaw säna.
If it happens once, it might happen again.	Mä kuti ukham pasaspa ukhajja, inas mayamp pasaspa.
But not at the same time.	Ukampis janiw uka pachpa tiempon utjkänti.
Time doesn’t work the way you think it does.	Tiempox janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamarjam irnaqkiti.
He knew his way around.	Jupajj kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatïna.
You could have something more.	Jumax juk’ampi kunas utjaspa.
But there is no such question.	Ukampis janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkiti.
I like myself a lot.	Nayajj nayajj wal gustitu.
Do it well this time.	Jichha kutin sum luram.
He wanted to leave the house again.	Jupax wasitat utapat mistuñ munäna.
It’s going to be a great day, it’s going to be a great tomorrow.	Ukax mä jach’a uruw utjani, ukax mä jach’a qharüruw utjani.
Do it yourself next time.	Jutïr kutin juma pachpaw ukham lurañama.
After that, he drove off somewhere.	Uka qhepatjja, kawkirus autot sarjjäna.
I’d be happy to say whatever you want, you know.	Nayax wali kusisitaw kuntix jumax munkta uk arsuñ munta, jumax yatisktawa.
Two more things need to be done.	Pä lurañanak jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
You need to do this as soon as possible.	Ukajj jankʼakiw lurañama.
And it’s very popular.	Ukat wali uñt’atawa.
She was wonderful, she loved it.	Jupajj wali sumapunïnwa, jupajj wal munasïna.
And the longer the better.	Ukat jukʼamp tiempojj jukʼamp askiwa.
You have to do one.	Mä lurañamawa.
What you think is true.	Kuntï jumax amuykta ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
But he didn't say anything about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet kuns arskänti.
He lived a long, long life.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow jakasïna, wali jaya tiempow jakasïna.
He couldn't do it right away.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
You can do whatever you want with him.	Jupampiw kuntï munkta uk lurasma.
I didn't know any better.	Janiw jukʼamp sum yatkayätti.
He knew it first hand.	Jupajj nayrïr kutiw uk yatïna.
He was clearly aware.	Jupajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Last night was the first day.	Qhipa arumax nayrïr uruw utjäna.
And old, so very old.	Ukat nayra, ukhama wali nayra.
But this doesn’t work.	Ukampis akax janiw irnaqkiti.
After that, he barely wanted her.	Uka qhepatjja, jupajj jukʼakiw jupar munäna.
And a few more.	Ukat mä qawqha juk’ampi.
It’s going to happen.	Ukhamaw pasani.
There was no time.	Janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
Everything is happening now.	Taqi kunas jichhax luraski.
I think there is something.	Nayax kunas utji sasaw amuyta.
So maybe.	Ukhamajj inas.
Another three years.	Yaqha kimsa mara.
Always is, always will be.	Sapa kutiw utji, sapa kutiw utjani.
I don’t like any of that.	Ukanakat janiw kunas nayatak askïkiti.
First time, last time.	Nayrïr kuti, qhipa kuti.
Or they still.	Jan ukax jupanakax wali.
Well, it was very quiet.	Ukhama, wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
Let’s do it with joy.	Uk kusisit lurañäni.
And there is something worse.	Ukat jukʼamp jan waliw utji.
Later, he came to the conclusion.	Qhepatjja, akham sasaw amuyäna.
She thought that was exciting.	Ukajj wali kusiskañawa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
You need to create a permit for this.	Ukatakejj mä permiso lurañamawa.
Very rarely do I get to do that.	Wali juk’akiw ukham lurañax puri.
That’s pretty cool about this.	Ukax wali sumaw aka tuqitxa.
This is the last snowflake.	Akax qhipa ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi satawa.
I wasn’t surprised there.	Ukanx janiw muspharkayätti.
¡That's a good thing!.	¡Ukax wali askiwa!.
I agree with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw iyaw sista.
I can’t believe that.	Nayax janiw ukax iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Or with me.	Jan ukajj nayamp chika.
But he didn't say all of that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kuns arskänti.
This is a new era.	Akax machaq pacharuw purini.
He did this three times.	Kimsa kutiw uk luräna.
He meant to say that.	Jupajj ukham sañ munäna.
He knew he didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti, uk sum yatïna.
What.	Kuna.
He has given it up.	Jupajj ukanak jaytawayi.
How can a man do it.	Kunjamsa mä jaqejj luraspa.
I know it looks a lot like that.	Nayax yattwa ukax walja ukham uñt’atawa.
He wanted to do it yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw lurañ munäna.
But, a house.	Ukampis, mä uta.
The incident did just fine.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj wali sumwa luräna.
So you know how he feels.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi uk jumajj yatisktawa.
Very cool, actually.	Wali thaya, chiqpachansa.
It’s getting there.	Ukaruw puri.
Anyway, nobody wants them.	Kawkhansa, janiw khitis jupanakar munkiti.
I really didn’t care.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurkti.
Well, it's not you.	Ukhamajj janiw jumajj ukhamäkiti.
Of course not, not at all.	Chiqansa janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never quite understood it.	Janipuniw uk sum amuyirïkti.
He’s like that.	Jupax ukhamawa.
Well, he didn’t tell anyone.	Suma, janiw khitirus siskänti.
He will come after me.	Jupajj nayar qhepatwa jutani.
I had to do what I did.	Kuntï lurawaykta uk lurañaw wakisïna.
I didn't want to tell you.	Nayajj janiw jumar yatiyañ munkayätti.
But he didn't understand that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk amuykänti.
I love that so much!.	¡Ukax walpun munasta!.
And not like he used to.	Ukat janiw kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama.
This will take years.	Ukatakejj walja maranakaw munasini.
I’m still in something wrong.	Nayax wali kuna jan walt’äwin jikxatasiyäta.
That is not what he wants to do.	Ukajj janiw kuntï lurañ munkiti.
He knew it, and he loved her.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna, ukatwa jupar wal munasïna.
I really think he meant it.	Chiqpachansa, jupax uk sañ munäna sasaw amuyta.
He gave her some food.	Jupajj mä jukʼa manqʼa churäna.
He loves it here.	Jupax akanx walpun munasi.
Now, you just have to.	Jichhax, jumax ukhamakiw.
And he immediately began to do it.	Ukat jankʼakiw lurañ qalltäna.
In fact, I've never seen him talk like that.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukham parlir uñjkti.
He had no reason to.	Jupajj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
Twenty years ago.	Pä tunka mara nayra.
I look forward to seeing you at the event.	Uka tantachäwin uñjañ suytʼaskta.
But he said that was none of my business.	Ukampis janiw ukajj nayan lurañapäkiti sasaw säna.
So tell me this.	Ukhamajj aka yatiyapjjeta.
I don't believe it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw creykti.
I am very excited about it.	Nayajj uka toqet wal kusista.
He will come with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw jutani.
It was a very good feeling.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
I'm not sure who said that first.	Khitis nayraqat ukham säna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Time to do what is right.	Kunatï walïki uk lurañatakiw tiempo.
You know it well enough.	Jumax sum yatisktawa.
He didn't like these things.	Ukanakajj janiw jupar gustkänti.
I do this every day.	Nayax sapa uruw ukham luraskta.
I want to give it to you.	Nayax jumanakar churañ munta.
So let's see if that works.	Ukhamajj ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk uñjañäni.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
I think everyone else is too!.	Nayax amuyta taqiniw ukhamaraki!.
Let's see how this happens.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk uñjañäni.
Over and over and over again.	Walja kutiw walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
I wanted to give it a chance.	Nayax mä ch’am churañ munta.
Maybe a year.	Inas mä mara.
He loved the little bus.	Jupajj uka jiskʼa autot sarañ wal munäna.
I love to party.	Nayax fiestar sarañax walpun munta.
He was a citizen of a country.	Jupajj mä markankir jaqënwa.
Let's do that now.	Jichhajj uk lurañäni.
I'm saying something.	Nayax kuns sista.
Like something is wrong with me.	Kunjamtï kunas nayatak jan walïki ukhama.
I love doing that.	Uk lurañajj nayatakejj wal gustitu.
This is not enough time.	Ukajj janiw tiempojj wakiskiti.
I had no idea what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk janiw amuykayätti.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukham amuyasïna.
It had to be done once.	Mä kutix lurañaw wakisïna.
I am so sorry to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj walpun llakista.
I’m still waiting, actually.	Nayax wali suyt’askta, chiqpachansa.
I doubt that’s the case.	Nayax uka tuqit pächastwa.
That’s how it ended.	Ukhamaw tukuyäna.
We just have it today.	Jichhürunakan jichhakiw utjistu.
A better me.	Mä juk’amp suma naya.
That is what happened here.	Ukaw aka cheqan pasäna.
Don't do anything wrong.	Janiw jan walinak lurañamäkiti.
That’s where it’s going.	Ukax ukaruw saraski.
That’s exactly what it is.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa.
Well, it was pretty good.	Ukhama, wali sumapunïnwa.
I’ve been there many times.	Walja kutiw ukar sarawayta.
So it's not a good thing.	Ukhamajj janiw walïkiti.
It’s worth doing this.	Uka lurañax wali askiwa.
But he seemed kind.	Ukampis suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I just don't know what's wrong with me.	Nayajj janiw yatkti kunas nayatak jan walïki ukjja.
So that's pretty amazing.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
There is not much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
What we will do first.	Kunsa nayrajj lurañäni.
He didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw arskänti.
I want to get out of me.	Nayax nayat mistuñ munta.
But there was no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkänti.
I don’t want him one.	Nayax janiw jupar mä munkti.
I don’t know when, how, or why.	Kunapachas, kunjamatsa, kunatsa uk janiw yatkti.
I’ve seen it well.	Uk sum uñjta.
It always feels like that.	Sapa kutiw ukham amuyasi.
So there is something.	Ukhamajj mä kunaw utji.
Let's see how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk uñjañäni.
And they know it all too well.	Ukat jupanakax wali sum yatipxi.
He was in love with her.	Jupajj wal munasïna.
I'm going to love it.	Nayajj walpun munta.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
It won’t last long for me.	Nayatakix janiw jaya tiempox utjkaniti.
Therefore, he was very afraid.	Ukatwa jupajj wal ajjsaräna.
He is better than I am today.	Jupax jichhürunakanxa nayat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
That’s what everyone needs.	Ukax taqiniw wakisi.
He does nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurkiti.
He didn't really say anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kunatsa ukham siskänti.
I’ve done a lot of walking.	Nayax wal sarnaqañ lurawayta.
He knows wine.	Jupax vino yati.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ukanjja, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
The film needs to be made.	Uka película lurañaw wakisi.
He’s something more.	Jupax kunas juk’ampi.
In fact, I’ve never really seen anything like it.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukham chiqpachapuni uñjkti.
I didn't mean it.	Janiw nayajj uk sañ munkayätti.
So he’s like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamawa.
If anything could happen to them, it was.	Jupanakar kunas pasaspa ukhajja, ukhamänwa.
In fact, it has always done so.	Chiqansa, nayratpachaw ukham lurawayi.
He said it was well known.	Jupax wali uñt’atawa sasaw säna.
I don't quite know what to do about it.	Janiw uka toqet kun lurañsa taqpach yatkti.
Something not so good is happening to him.	Kunas jan sinti sumaw jupar pasaski.
It can just happen.	Ukajj ukhamakiw pasaspa.
Good day as well.	Suma uru ukhama.
Such a beautiful film!!.	Ukham suma película!!.
He’s a warm person.	Junt’u jaqiwa jupax.
Let’s do what’s right.	Kunatï cheqäki uk lurañäni.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañanak yatkayätti.
So he goes for it.	Ukatwa jupajj ukatakix saraski.
So about as bad as it gets.	Ukhamajj niyaw kunjamtï jan walïki ukhama.
I didn’t understand it.	Janiw uk amuykayätti.
You are an amazing person.	Jumax muspharkañ jaqiwa.
It’s going to be a great time.	Ukax mä jach’a pachaw utjani.
I’ve seen him do it.	Nayax jupar uk lurir uñjta.
It doesn’t do any of this.	Janiw kunas ukanak lurkiti.
I love every day about him.	Jupat sapa uruw walpun munasta.
It spoke to him.	Ukajj jupampiw parläna.
That’s really nice.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
It’s been a great experience for me!.	¡Nayatakix wali askiwa!.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis uk munkiti.
I knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
And that was three days ago.	Ukat ukajj kimsa uru nayraw pasäna.
Of course, he meant he could.	Chiqansa, jupax ukham luraspawa sañ munäna.
Now he’s .	Jichhax jupax .
Nothing works here.	Janiw kunas akan irnaqkiti.
Now what could happen.	Jichhajj kunas pasaspa.
There’s just that.	Ukanx ukakiw utji.
Or from here.	Jan ukax aka chiqat.
I thought it was pretty obvious.	Nayax wali qhanaw sasaw amuyayäta.
He is a.	Jupax mä...
As a necessary one.	Mä wakiskir ukhama.
It was the day itself.	Uka urux pachpa uruw utjäna.
That old boy lives with you.	Uka nayra waynax jumamp chikaw jakasi.
Tell them why.	Kunatsa uk jupanakar yatiyañama.
There was no reason.	Janiw kunatsa utjkänti.
But he couldn't do it then.	Ukampis janiw uka tiempon lurañ puedkänti.
You have to do the work.	Uka lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
That morning.	Uka alwajj.
I’m waiting to find out.	Nayax uk yatxatañ suyt’askta.
They don’t know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatipkiti.
Yes, this is for you.	Jïsa, akax jumatakix walikïskiwa.
He immediately gave the orders.	Jank’akiw uka kamachinak churäna.
But there is no set time limit.	Ukampis janiw mä qhawqha tiempojj utjkiti.
But it obviously wasn’t.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukhamäkänti.
I didn't think so when it happened.	Ukajj paskäna ukhajj janiw ukham amuykayätti.
The.	Jupa.
That’s how it feels.	Ukhamaw ukham jikxatasi.
The situation was unique.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
I know it wasn't.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, uk sum yatta.
And he didn't want that to happen again.	Ukat janiw mayamps ukham lurasiñap munkänti.
But I understand the problem, I think.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj sum amuyasta, sasaw amuyta.
He said he didn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkti sasaw säna.
We will have the rest of the day.	Jiwasax uka urux qhipharux utjani.
I didn’t care, but it was what I wanted.	Janiw kuns lurkti, jan ukasti kuntï munkayäta ukawa.
Well, that’s about it.	Ukhama, uka tuqitxa.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munäna.
I, of course, don’t.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurkti.
But it was, at least.	Ukampis ukhamänwa, mä jukʼa.
And if something goes wrong.	Ukat kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa ukhaxa.
I was pleasantly surprised.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw muspharta.
He knew that sort of thing.	Jupajj uka kasta yatïna.
He knew what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
So there was one before that.	Ukhamajj uka nayrajj mayniw utjäna.
But he could do anything.	Ukampis jupajj taqe kunwa luraspäna.
And there won’t be.	Ukat janiw utjkaniti.
And I’m a good guy.	Ukat nayax wali suma jaqïtwa.

I just asked the question.	Nayax ukhamakiw jiskt’asta.
I have more here than you.	Nayajj jumat sipansa jukʼampiw aka cheqan utji.
He said it takes a lot of time.	Walja tiempow wakisi sasaw säna.

So I ask why.	Ukatwa kunatsa jisktʼasta.
You can do it yourself.	Ukxa juma pachpaw lurasma.

But I won’t do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkäti.

There could be a better time.	Ukanjja, jukʼamp suma tiempow utjaspa.

He says do it, but not tomorrow.	Jupax luram siwa, ukampis janiw qharürux luramti.
That shouldn’t be a bad thing.	Ukax janiw jan walinak lurañapäkiti.
I could have done more.	Nayajj jukʼampiw luraspäna.
He tried to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.

He wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Jupajj janiw kuntï lurañ amtkäna uk sum yatkänti.

That is not the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.
He did well for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempojj sumwa luräna.

There is no secret.	Janiw mä jamasat lurañas utjkiti.

It’s really good, really, really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumawa, chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
When he heard this, he asked himself:	Uk istʼasajj akham sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Really? 	Chiqpachansa?
And that is not a problem.	Ukat ukax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Like before, only this time he was fast asleep.	Kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, aka kutikiw jupajj wali ikiskäna.

I didn’t understand how.	Kunjamsa uk jan amuykayätti.
So he told them.	Ukatwa jupanakar yatiyäna.
But all the time is worth it.	Ukampis taqe uka tiempojj wali askiwa.
No one was talking about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit arskänti.
Honestly, that wasn’t what I had.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukax nayatakix utjkänti.
She falls in love with him immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar munasi.
And nobody does anything about it.	Ukat janiw khitis uka tuqitx kuns lurkiti.

All of this takes time.	Taqi ukanakax tiempow munasispa.

He was afraid he wouldn't.	Jupajj jan ukham lurañapatakiw ajjsaräna.
I don’t like it here anymore.	Nayax janiw akanx juk’amp gustkituti.
He was in a state of shock.	Jupax wali llakitaw sarnaqäna.
There was nothing for it.	Ukatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Jupajj janis uka toqet parlañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Janiw kunas kunäkisa.
It was nothing at all.	Ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
I want to say something.	Nayax kuns sañ munta.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkänti.
So he left this morning.	Ukatwa jichha alwajj sarjjäna.
A word above all else.	Taqi kunat sipansa mä aru.
He didn’t say it anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans uk siskänti.
That is not the case now.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was no such thing before.	Uka nayrajj janiw utjkänti.

No one wants to miss the event.	Janiw khitis uka tantachäwir jan sarañ munkiti.
Nothing can be done about it now.	Jichhax janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti.
All or nothing, he said.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas, sasaw säna.
He doesn't know how he wants it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj munki uk yatkiti.
He was not sure who he was now.	Jichhajj khitïnsa uk janiw sum amuyaskänti.
He didn't want to come here.	Jupajj janiw akan jutañ munkänti.
He saw what was happening.	Kunatï paskäna uk uñjäna.

And he never did that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
They know all about it.	Jupanakax taqi ukanak yatipxi.
There again, yes.	Ukanx wasitatwa, jïsa.
You’ll feel the same way.	Jumax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïta.

I want someone to drive.	Nayax maynix auto apnaqañ munta.

It looks lovely.	Ukax wali munasiñampiw uñtasi.
And he didn't want to come.	Ukat janiw jutañ munkänti.
I want to go a lot.	Nayax walpun sarañ munta.
He didn't realize it.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.

No one wanted to know about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkänti.
He knew how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ sum yatïna.
There is nothing he can do.	Janiw kunas jupajj lurkaspati.
It will be a hot day.	Uka urux wali junt’u uruw utjani.
He walked and walked.	Jupax sarnaqäna ukat sarnaqäna.
The person was very happy.	Jaqix wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He finished her off.	Jupaw jupar tukuyäna.
But again, not us.	Ukampis mayampsa, janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkiti.
Well, I'm not the one.	Ukhamajj janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.

And he knew the game.	Ukat jupax uka anattʼañ yatïna.

He was gone for three years.	Jupajj kimsa maraw jan sarjjäna.
I don't remember much back then.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw sinti amtaskti.
He said it was worth it.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw säna.

Today that would be double.	Jichhürunakanxa ukax pä kutiw utjaspa.

But, you can do really well.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa wali sumwa lurasma.

But he never really did.	Ukampis janipuniw chiqpachansa ukham lurkänti.
How well he saw the night.	Kunjamsa uka arumax sum uñjäna.
But he’s in a good place.	Ukampis jupax mä suma chiqan jikxatasi.
But there is nothing wrong with that.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Something was always there.	Kunas sapa kutiw utjäna.

He began to tell me about the day.	Uka urux kunas pasäna uk yatiyañ qalltäna.
He knows something.	Jupax kuns yati.
It’s not breakfast.	Janiw desayuno ukhamäkiti.
There was energy here.	Aka chiqanx ch’amaw utjäna.

And the week after that.	Ukat uka semana qhepatjja.
He didn't know what to make of it all.	Jupajj janiw kunsa taqe ukanak lurañap yatkänti.
And then do it again the next day .	Ukat ukat qhipürux wasitat lurañaw wakisi .

He thought it was all right.	Jupajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyäna.
So much, and so on, and so on.	Ukhama, ukat juk’ampi, ukat juk’ampi.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
I never wanted to give up.	Janipuniw jaytañ munkayätti.
No problem, really.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
It’s really one of the two.	Chiqpachansa uka pä tuqit maynïriwa.
The same is true here.	Ukhamarakiw akanx utji.
Too much of something isn’t good for anyone.	Kunas sinti walja lurañax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
No one really knows what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkiti.
He eventually moves to it.	Jupax qhipharux ukaruw sarxi.
A little bit of a big one.	Mä juk’a jach’a.
But that is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti.

And there he was again.	Ukat ukan wasitatwa jikxatasïna.
I don’t want to stay in this house.	Nayax janiw aka utan qhiparañ munkti.

This kind of problem had never happened before.	Nayrajj janiw uka kasta jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
There has never been such a thing.	Janipuniw kunapachas ukham jan walinak utjkänti.

He went with her.	Jupajj jupamp chikaw sarjjäna.
Everything is fine.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
He said he never quite understood what he was trying to say.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk janipuniw sum amuykti sasaw säna.

He didn't say much.	Jupajj janiw sinti arskänti.
Do something else.	Yaqha lurañanak luram.

Not in any way, not at any time.	Janiw kuna tuqitsa, janiw kuna pachas.
Of course he loved it.	Chiqansa jupax wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
Or what he didn't do.	Jan ukajj kuntï jan lurkäna uk.
He did this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham luräna.
He was still asleep in the little bed.	Jupajj uka jiskʼa ikiñan wali ikiskäna.
At home, at school.	Utan, yatiqañ utan.
I didn't need that, never needed it.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskänti, janiw kunapachas wakiskänti.
That hadn’t been the case for, well, a while.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti, wali, mä juk’a pachaw ukhamäkänti.
There is no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskiti.
And so it is.	Ukat ukhamaraki.
This is apparently not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
He let it go, he knew it.	Jupax jaytawayi, jupax uk yatïna.
I never thought anything about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet kuns amuyirïkti.
I don't know how that's going to happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.

There is a negative energy in this country.	Aka markanx jan wali ch'amaw utji.
I want to talk about you.	Nayax jumat parlañ munta.
Sure enough, it came.	Chiqpachansa, ukax jutäna.

Of course, in both cases.	Chiqansa, pä tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.

No, it didn't make sense.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj amuyaskänti.
He was surprised to see her.	Jupar uñjasajj wal muspharäna.

That day lives another day.	Uka urux yaqha uruw jakasi.

It was a slow motion.	Ukhamwa amuyasïna.
That’s totally fine.	Ukax taqpach wali askiwa.
That was exactly the point.	Ukajj cheqapuniw uka toqet parläna.
Good word.	Suma aru.

Of course, there is something worse than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan waliw utji.
Because someone has to.	Kunatix maynix lurañapawa.
In fact, he always did.	Chiqansa, jupax sapa kutiw ukham luratayna.
Now that’s all there was.	Jichhax ukakiw utjäna.
It’s pretty obvious to me.	Nayatakix wali qhanaw uñjasi.

And the next day.	Ukat qhipürux.
All the time I’ve been here.	Taqi uka pachaw akanktxa.
It was only needed once.	Mä kutikiw munasïna.
What’s coming next?.	¿Kunas jutïrin jutani?.
But now he did nothing to do so.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukham lurañatakejj kuns lurkänti.
Almost no one knew about you.	Niya janiw khitis jumat yatkänti.
Please tell me what needs to be done.	Kun lurañas wakisispa uk yatiyapjjeta.
And yes, it was.	Ukat jïsa, ukhamänwa.
I was grateful to him at that time.	Uka tiemponjja, jupar wal yuspärta.
He felt very mature.	Jupajj wali jilïr jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
That was the end of it.	Ukaw tukuyäna.
I know that’s not good enough.	Nayax yattwa ukax janiw askïkiti.
But then he found something.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kuns jikjjatasïna.
Nice and soft.	Suma ukat llamp’u.

That was all he could think of.	Ukakiw jupajj amuyäna.
I thought there might be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Nayatakix kunas ‘jan wali’ utjaspa sasaw amuyayäta.
He dropped his cigarette.	Jupajj cigarro jaqontäna.
How impossible it felt.	Kunjamsa jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
I am very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
And this isn’t the case.	Ukat akax janiw ukhamäkiti.

I’m really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Amazing, you say.	Muspharkañawa, jumax siwa.
But that’s not the point.	Ukampis ukax janiw uka tuqitxa.
This is not something you can do.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
She’s a great woman.	Jupax mä jach’a warmiwa.
Or some kind of car.	Jan ukax mä kasta auto.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
He doesn't have anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
He loved to play soccer.	Jupajj pelot anattʼañ wal munäna.
That was what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj wal munäna.
What you say matters.	Kuntï siskta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He doesn’t want to believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañ munkiti.
He was a good man, she thought.	Jupax suma jaqiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
He doesn’t know what’s going on.	Jupax janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkiti.
He was quiet, attentive.	Jupax amukiw jikxatasïna, wali amuyumpiw jikxatasïna.
He wanted to give her everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupar churañ munäna.
Or, at least not yet.	Jan ukax, mä juk’a pachax janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
They know how to eat well.	Jupanakax sum manq’añ yatipxi.

It really takes a good amount of time.	Chiqpachansa, mä suma tiempow munasi.
You tell us about it.	Jumax yatiyapxita.
Which he never would have done.	Kuntï janipuniw lurkaspänti.
But let’s see what happens.	Ukampis kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
This was quite obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw jikjjatasïna.
He wondered where it would lead.	Jupajj kawkirus purini sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Not bad yet.	Janiw jichhakamax jan walïkiti.
Do it anyway.	Kunjamatsa uk luram.
This is rarely the case.	Ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
That’s what it means now.	Ukax jichhax sañ muni.

I haven’t been like that in years.	Walja maranakaw jan ukhamäkti.
Very happy and excited about this.	Wali kusisitaw ukat kusisitaw aka tuqitxa.

That's what you do best.	Ukaw jumajj jukʼamp sum lurasma.
But he didn't do it very often.	Ukampis janiw walja kuti ukham lurkänti.

And this is okay.	Ukat akax walikïskiwa.
He was just there.	Jupax ukhamakiw ukan jikxatasïna.
But it all comes down to this moment.	Ukampis taqi kunas aka pacharuw puri.
There is none of these.	Ukanakat janiw kunas utjkiti.
Tomorrow has all the potential to be a good day.	Qhipürux taqi ch’amampiw mä suma urux utjani.
What are we going to do like that.	¿Kunsa ukham lurañäni.
It’s exactly what he didn’t want.	Chiqpachansa kuntï jupax jan munkäna ukawa.
Not as it happens.	Janiw kunjamtï pasaski ukhama.
There is nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas utjkiti.

She immediately felt a little better.	Ukat jankʼakiw mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.
Let’s do something.	Kunas lurañäni.

I think he just decided to get involved.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukhamakiw ukar mantañ amtäna.
He knew he wasn't.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk sum yatïna.
But I don’t see that happening.	Ukampis janiw ukham pasañap uñjkti.
And the snow.	Ukat ch’uqi.
He knows better than I do.	Jupajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum yati.
Or so he told himself.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupa pachpajj säna.
He was feeling sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He has always been willing to give everything.	Jupajj nayratpachaw taqe kun churañ munäna.
He was a character.	Jupajj mä jaqënwa.
I thought they were interesting.	Jupanakajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
He was well aware of this.	Jupajj uka toqet sumwa yatïna.
I don't know how he's going to get through.	Kunjamsa jupajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.
That’s not bad, but it’s not good.	Ukax janiw jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw askïkiti.
But the !!!.	Ukampis uka !!!.
But he went there.	Ukampis jupajj ukaruw sarjjäna.
Not this time around.	Janiw aka kutix utjkiti.
Immediately there were more important things.	Ukat jankʼakiw jukʼamp wakiskir kunanakas utjäna.
I’m really looking forward to this.	Chiqpachansa nayax aka tuqit suyt’askta.
He left the country immediately.	Jupax jank’akiw markat sarxäna.
It’s all or nothing.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas utjkiti.
But he couldn't, he knew.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti, uk sum yatïna.
But he didn't know exactly why.	Ukampis kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
That means a lot.	Ukax walja sañ muni.
He could do all the work.	Jupaw taqe lurañanak luraspäna.
He wanted to know why.	Kunatsa uk yatiñ munäna.
But it’s all wonderful.	Ukampis taqe kunas wali muspharkañawa.
It’s been a long time now.	Walja pachaw jichhax.
But nobody really wants that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk cheqpachapun munkiti.
I don't believe he did that.	Ukham luratapat janiw creykti.
Which he certainly did not do.	Ukjja jupajj cheqapuniw jan lurkänti.
He has done it before.	Jupajj nayraw uk lurawayi.
Or rather, somehow.	Jan ukajj sañ munäna, kunjamatsa.
It was pretty good, too.	Wali sumapunïnwa, ukhamaraki.
He never does that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
It’s still young.	Ukax wali waynawa.
You’ll be there for a long time.	Jumax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasïta.
Less.	Juk'a.
That never works.	Ukax janipuniw irnaqkiti.
So do one of these.	Ukhamajj mä luram.
It had to be rebuilt.	Wasitat lurañaw wakisïna.
And finally, and .	Ukat qhepatjja, ukat .
It was like that for me.	Nayatakix ukhamänwa.
And that’s pretty cool.	Ukat ukax wali sumawa.
He called the boy.	Jupajj uka waynaruw jawsäna.
He’s done that.	Jupax ukham lurawayi.
You too red all over.	Jumax sinti wila taqi chuyma.
I thought that was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
The time is almost here.	Uka pachax niyaw purini.
That doesn’t mean much on its own.	Ukax janiw sapakix walpun sañ munkiti.
If you want a room, let me know.	Jumatix mä cuarto munsta ukhaxa, yatiyapxita.
You’re better off.	Jumax juk’amp askiwa.
I could never quite figure out how I did it.	Kunjamsa uk lurawayta uk janipuniw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
There’s a smile on your face.	Ukhama ukaxa.
There will be a time limit for that.	Ukatakejj mä tiempow utjani.
I couldn't figure out who he was.	Janiw khitïnsa uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
There is no time now.	Jichhajj janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
What do you do with yourself.	¿Kunsa jumajj lurasma.
That’s what’s going to happen to us.	Ukaw jiwasatak pasani.
One in the morning and one in the afternoon.	Maynix alwaw ukat maynix chika uruw.
I gave up the chance.	Nayax uka ch’am jaytawayta.
No one wanted to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañ munkänti.
I had to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
Not really, she said.	Janiw chiqpachansa, sasaw jupax säna.
But don't tell me.	Ukampis jan yatiyapjjeta.
I told him that at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, ukhamwa jupar sista.
Overall, it’s getting better.	Taqi kunat sipansa, juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
Of course you know.	Chiqpachansa jumax yatisktawa.
He said he didn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
You’re a great guy.	Jumax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
I don't want to do anything stupid.	Nayajj janiw kuna loqhe lurañsa munkti.
So it doesn't work for me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayatakejj walïkiti.
You can do it again.	Ukajj wasitatwa lurasma.
This is the only one.	Akax mä sapakiw.
Or so it felt, for about a week.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna, niya mä semanaw ukham jikjjatasïna.
He saw the worst.	Jupaw jukʼamp jan walinak uñjäna.
I don't need that.	Nayajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
He told me that many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukham sitäna.
So we went there for a year.	Ukatwa mä mara uka cheqar sarapjjta.
And, another important factor.	Ukat, yaqha tuqitxa wali wakiskiriwa.
There’s something going on here.	Aka chiqanx kunas utji.
That was no problem at all.	Ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He doesn’t like anyone.	Jupax janiw khitirus gustkiti.
That was about a week ago.	Ukajj niya mä semana nayraw pasäna.
Actually, really good.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
A new car.	Mä machaq auto.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa yatïna.
Or anyone else.	Jan ukax khitirus.
And he knew how to keep a secret.	Ukat kunjamsa mä jamasat yatiyañ yatïna.
He has to go to work every day.	Jupax sapa uruw irnaqäwir sarañapa.
Well, you have one.	Ukhama, jumax mä.
If only it had happened a few hours earlier.	Mä qawqha horanak nayrajj ukham luraspäna ukhajja.
It takes some time.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw munasispa.
He certainly doesn't want to go to a restaurant.	Chiqansa, janiw mä manqʼañ utar sarañ munkiti.
He had one and the other.	Jupajj mä ukat mayniw utjäna.
I know, but .	Nayax yattwa, ukampis .
You need to do some things.	Mä qawqha lurañaw wakisi.
No he’s not like that.	Janiwa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn't do anything there.	Ukanjja janiw kuns lurkti.
Everything goes faster.	Taqi kunas juk’amp jank’akiw saraski.
A little bit actually.	Mä juk’a chiqpachansa.
He had a clear sense of right and wrong.	Jupajj kunatï walïki jan walïki uk sum amuyäna.
There was a power there.	Ukanx mä ch’amaw utjäna.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis uk lurañaw wakisi.
But, he quickly turned around.	Ukampis, jankʼakiw kuttʼjjäna.
See you next time!.	¡Jutïr kutin uñjañäni!.
I kind of like that too.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw mä jukʼa.
There’s a lot of value in it.	Ukanx wali askiwa.
I still have no idea what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk jichhakamajj janiw amuykti.
He learned how to make a film look like him.	Kunjamsa mä película jupar uñtasit lurañapa uk yateqäna.
I am pretty sure he was.	Nayajj jupajj ukhamänwa sasaw sum yatta.
I wasn't surprised in the slightest.	Janiw mä jukʼa muspharkayätti.
I didn't know how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk janiw yatkayätti.
That’s not a good thing for you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix wali askïkiti.
But of course there was no time for that.	Ukampis chiqansa janiw ukatakix tiempox utjkänti.
He already knew that, of course.	Jupax nayratpach uk yatïna, chiqpachansa.
Two, yes, but not three.	Pä, jïsa, ukampis janiw kimsa.
It’s pretty obvious really.	Ukax wali qhanawa chiqpachansa.
I’ve been doing this for a very long time.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw ukham luraskta.
After that, it doesn't.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now the big jan.	Jichhax jach’a jan.
But he declined to comment on how it happened.	Ukampis kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uka toqet janiw arskänti.
Actually, I’m still disappointed.	Chiqansa, nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
This really hit home with me today.	Chiqpachansa akax jichhürunakanx nayamp chikaw utar puri.
Beyond that, nothing really happens.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kunas chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
I think he is, at least.	Nayax amuyta jupax ukhamawa, mä juk’a.
That’s really good, of course.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
He was watching them.	Jupajj jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
Tell me what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk yatiyapjjeta.
That would be better, he thought.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I would love to do more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp lurañwa nayajj wal munta.
I want to do that again.	Nayax ukham wasitat lurañ munta.
It’s very popular and popular.	Wali uñt’atawa ukat wali uñt’atawa.
I was very impressed with him.	Jupat walpun muspharta.
I am really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa walpun kusista.
But then that was never the main problem.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janipuniw ukajj nayrïr jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
It’s almost a new year.	Niya machaq marax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I told him again.	Nayajj wasitatwa jupar sista.
He once told me it would be no problem.	Mä kutix janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw sitäna.
The process was constant.	Uka lurañajj sapa kutiw utjäna.
It doesn’t do what it says.	Janiw kuntï siski uk lurkiti.
He wants to have lunch with you.	Jupax jumamp chika chika uru manq’añ munaraki.
Honestly, I’m sorry, but .	Chiqpachansa, nayax llakistwa, ukampis .
She knew about it better than he did.	Jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa uka toqet yatïna.
He asked about himself.	Jupat jisktʼasïna.
I don’t want to go.	Janiw sarañ munkti.
You know, the real me.	Jumax yatisktawa, chiqpach naya.
How he wanted her.	Kunjamsa jupar munäna.
I don't know what that could be.	Ukajj kunas pasaspa uk janiw yatkti.
I didn't know about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet yatkayätti.
So much needs to be done.	Ukhamajj walja lurañaw wakisi.
I'm not going to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurkäti.
He means very well.	Jupax wali sum sañ muni.
He knew better now.	Jupajj jichhajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
It is 'itself so'.	Ukajj ‘jupa pachpaw ukhama’.
He pulled out a twenty dollar bill.	Jupajj pä tunka qollqe qollqe apsüna.
Of course, this is not necessary.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw wakiskiti.
Don't do things too fast.	Janiw kuns sinti jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
That's what he expected.	Ukhamaw jupajj suyäna.
That’s why I love him so much.	Ukatwa jupar wal munasta.
No one wants to argue.	Janiw khitis arsuñ munkiti.
But you can’t do that.	Ukampis jumax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He knows what to do.	Jupajj kuna lurañas uk sum yati.
This can last up to three days.	Ukax kimsa urukamaw utjaspa.
He admired her even more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jupar wali askit uñjäna.
We’ll see next year.	Jutïr maraw uñjañäni.
I don’t want to live like that.	Janiw ukham jakañ munkti.
It wanted to live again.	Ukax wasitat jakañ munäna.
That wasn’t the case tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw ukhamäkänti.
How it started, everything that was happening.	Kunjams qalltäna, taqi kunatix luraskäna.
But no, not before.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
I actually saw it used.	Chiqansa, uka apnaqañ uñjta.
I haven’t seen it.	Nayax janiw uñjkti.
I don't know how, but it works.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti, ukampis walikïskiwa.
But that is surprising.	Ukampis ukajj muspharkañawa.
He looked worried.	Jupajj llakitaw uñnaqäna.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow.	Qharürojj kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.
These look awesome.	Ukanakax wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
And that’s something that last year, it didn’t have.	Ukat ukax mä kunaw pasïr marax, janiw utjkänti.
I chose not to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw jan uk lurañ amtawayta.
I did this for a year.	Mä maraw uk lurawayta.
No one wanted to know anything.	Janiw khitis kuns yatiñ munkänti.
Large snowflakes.	Jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
You know this is good.	Jumax yatisktawa akax wali askiwa.
It won’t last long, it can’t last long.	Janiw jaya pachax utjkaniti, janiw jaya pachax utjkaspati.
So it can do some damage.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa jan walinak luraspa.
He was great all around.	Jupajj taqe cheqan wali jachʼa jaqënwa.
That's what he did.	Ukhamaw jupajj ukham luräna.
It felt longer now.	Jichhax juk’amp jaya pachaw jikxatasïna.
Why should you do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañama.
The truth is more.	Chiqaw juk’ampi.
But that didn't matter, he thought.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He is a teacher.	Jupajj mä yatichiriwa.
It’s unbelievable to do that.	Ukham lurañax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I might have to do that.	Nayax inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
But there are no people.	Ukampis janiw jaqenakajj utjkiti.
Because it’s time to make a decision.	Kunatix mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
And that house.	Ukat uka uta.
It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachansa wakiskiti.
We have everything we need.	Jiwasax taqi kunaw utjistu.

And you know that.	Ukat jumax uk yatisktawa.
He wanted to go very much.	Jupajj wal sarañ munäna.
Now, everyone knows that.	Jichhax, taqiniw uk yatipxi.

He loves to do these things.	Jupajj ukanak lurañ wal muni.
I really want this.	Chiqpachansa akax munta.
This is exactly what happened .	Ukajj cheqapuniw pasäna .
I'm going to do that now.	Jichhajj ukham lurir sarä.
He wants to do it again, he wants another chance.	Jupax wasitat lurañ muni, yaqha ch’am munaraki.

I never said that to anyone.	Janipuniw khitirus ukham siskti.

Well, that’s cold.	Ukhama, uka thaya.
You don’t have to do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurañamäkiti.
Why, why, why.	Kunatsa, kunatsa, kunatsa.
You may feel that this is impossible.	Inas ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyasta.

It’s not about the money.	Janiw qullqi tuqitxa.
He could have done that.	Ukham luraspäna.
But, these are not very useful.	Ukampis, ukanakax janiw sinti askïkiti.
I really understand that.	Chiqpachansa uk sum amuyta.
I started talking to him.	Nayajj jupampiw parlañ qalltawayta.
He was sincere and serious about it.	Jupajj taqe chuyma ukat wali amuyumpiw uka toqet parläna.
I decided to see him yesterday.	Nayax qharüruw jupar uñjañ amtawayta.
There is plenty of time.	Walja tiempow utji.
He understood everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa amuyäna.
I don't want that to happen to you.	Nayajj janiw jumanakar ukham pasañap munkti.
You can do this easily here.	Aka chiqanx jank’akiw uk lurasma.
But it is not true.	Ukampis janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
That is what he wanted to tell you.	Ukaw jupajj jumar yatiyañ munäna.
And then he can do that.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jupajj ukham luraspawa.
But this guy .	Ukampis aka waynax .
Things are not bad.	Kunanakas janiw jan walïkiti.
I don’t know who didn’t want that money before.	Janiw yatkti khitis nayrax uka qullqix jan munkänti.
He can't do it.	Jupajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
But nothing was noticeable.	Ukampis janiw kunas amuyaskänti.
No, never again.	Janiwa, janipuniw mayampsa.
We don’t, of course.	Jiwasax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I told them that.	Nayajj jupanakar ukham sista.
Each will have a slightly different outcome.	Sapa mayniw mä jukʼa yaqha amtar purini.

You're a great guy.	Jumax wali jach'a jaqiwa.
This is reasonable and obvious.	Ukajj walikïskiwa ukat qhanaw amuyasi.
I asked him what happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna sasaw jisktʼta.

I don't want to do that anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp ukham lurañ munkti.
And let them know immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupanakar yatiyañama.
There was no need for a new one.	Janiw machaq lurañax wakiskänti.

Let’s do everything we need to.	Taqi kunatix wakiski ukanak lurañäni.

But that wasn't the case nearly two decades ago.	Ukampis niya pä tunka mara nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It wasn’t like that recently.	Janiw jichhak ukhamäkänti.
He didn't know why that scared him, but it did.	Kunatsa ukajj jupar ajjsaräna uk janiw yatkänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.

These are important, of course.	Ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa, chiqpachansa.

Probably nothing to do at this point.	Inas aka pachanx jan kunas lurañax wakischispa.
That’s where it started.	Ukaw ukan qalltäna.
Of course, it was important.	Chiqansa, wali wakiskiriwa.
He had seen her twice before.	Jupajj nayrajj pä kutiw jupar uñjäna.
Can you do it yourself ? 	Juma pachpaw uk lurasma ?
He didn't know where to go.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkänti.
It’s very difficult for me to do this.	Nayatakix uk lurañax wali ch’amawa.
But he asked anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jisktʼäna.
This is an important part of building.	Ukajj uta lurañatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
This is not very useful.	Ukajj janiw sinti askïkiti.
I’ve never seen him do that to anyone.	Janipuniw khitimpis ukham lurir uñjkti.
It’s still worth it now.	Jichhax wali askiwa.

No one really knew for sure.	Janiw khitis chiqpachansa chiqpachapuni yatkänti.

And he was like that.	Ukat jupajj ukhamänwa.

But you are not like that.	Ukampis jumajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't like you.	Jupajj janiw jumar gustkiti.

Actually, no, forget it.	Chiqansa, janiwa, uk armasimti.
And it really works.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.

Of course, you shouldn't.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.

But not all of these are available.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanakajj utjkiti.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.

Everyone knows this to some extent.	Taqinipuniw mä juk’a uk yatipxi.
Or, you know.	Jan ukax, jumax yatisktawa.
He was a cruel man.	Jupajj qhuru jaqënwa.
And the blood.	Ukat wila.

He knew that was not the case.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti uk sum yatïna.

And now they know it doesn’t exist.	Ukat jichhax janiw utjkiti uk yatipxi.
I don’t think anyone noticed.	Janiw khitis amuyaskänti sasaw amuyta.
He was a small man.	Jupajj mä jiskʼa jaqënwa.
I feel so bad about myself right now.	Jichhax naya pachpaw wali jan walin jikxatastxa.
He didn't want to play with me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp anattʼañ munkänti.
I think the reason for this is obvious.	Nayax amuyta kunatsa ukax utji ukax qhanaw amuyasi.
All in all, he’s doing great.	Taqi kunas, jupax wali sum luraski.
Here’s how .	Akax kunjamsa .

He just got it.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk katoqäna.

There’s a slight breeze.	Mä jisk’a thaya utji.

Too far, too far.	Sinti jaya, wali jaya.
I don’t know, really.	Janiw yatkti, chiqpachansa.
It is best not to do so.	Jan ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.

Then one night, he saw her.	Ukat mä arumax, jupar uñjäna.
He didn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
A very nice place.	Mä wali suma chiqa.
That’s how he felt.	Ukhamaw jupax jikxatasïna.
He went home immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw utar sarjjäna.
He’s an adult.	Jupax jilïr jaqiwa.
I didn’t know anything.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkayätti.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
And there isn't much time left.	Ukat janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
Don't do that to yourself.	Janiw juma pachpajj ukham luramti.

This may very well be done.	Ukax inas wali sum lurañax wakischispa.

He didn't seem to be that kind of person.	Jupajj janiw uka kasta jaqëkaspas ukhamäkänti.
You've never.	Jumax kunapachas.
But it doesn't, but it doesn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He does not know the truth.	Kunatï cheqäki uk janiw sum yatkiti.
But it still moved a little fast.	Ukampis wali mä jukʼa jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
It didn't do anything.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurkänti.

He just felt like that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna.
Not that night.	Janiw uka arumax.
I want to do it now.	Jichhax lurañ munta.
I didn’t do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurkti.
Please tell us about it.	Uka toqet yatiyapjjeta.

But someone has to do it.	Ukampis mayniw ukham lurañapa.
He couldn't do it.	Janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
A lot, actually.	Walja, chiqpachansa.
And where it came from, no one seems to know.	Ukat kawkitsa jutäna, janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamawa.
Something happened, happened, something happened.	Kunas pasäna, pasäna, kunas pasäna.
He doesn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkiti.
How much money do you need.	Qhawqha qullqis munasispa.
Because it’s beautiful and delicious.	Kunatix wali suma ukat wali sumawa.

I think less is more which is good.	Nayax amuyta juk’akiw juk’ampi ukax wali askiwa.

Of course, he said.	Chiqpachansa, sasaw säna.

You guys are awesome!!.	Jumanakax wali muspharkañawa!!.

You really don’t care about anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas jumatakix askïkiti.
Tonight is the only time I can do that.	Jichha arumax mä kutikiw ukham lurañax wakisispa.
I didn’t like or want anything.	Janiw kunas gustkituti ni kunsa munkayätti.
We really should do that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurañasa.

I want to tell him.	Nayax jupar yatiyañ munta.
He threw me away.	Jupaw nayar jaqontäna.

He was not now, but he will be soon.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj utjkänti, ukampis jankʼakiw utjani.

You can’t say no.	Janiw janiw sañjamäkiti.

He will not do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkaniti.
He gave her advice.	Jupaw ewjjtʼäna.
I’ve been here for a week.	Nayax mä semanaw akan jikxatastxa.
You can find everything here.	Aka chiqanx taqi kunaw jikxatasi.

But there is something about him.	Ukampis jupat mä kunaw utji.
I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw ukham lurañ amtawayta.
He was like himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukhamänwa.
As always, he knew what was right.	Kunjamtï sapa kuti lurkäna ukhama, kunatï walïki uk sum yatïna.
Something matters, or it doesn’t.	Kunas wakisi, jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But the facts are clear.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanawa.
And you have to do it financially.	Ukat qullqi tuqit lurañaw wakisi.
It really wasn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He appreciated it.	Jupajj uk wali askit uñjäna.
He took care of them.	Jupaw jupanakar uñjäna.
Everything is not good.	Taqi kunas janiw askïkiti.
So it is obvious.	Ukhamajj qhanaw amuyasi.
Except there is nothing.	Jan ukasti janiw kunas utjkiti.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kuna jan wali lurañas utjkiti.
If that would be interesting.	Ukajj wali askïspa ukhajja.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.

I didn't realize that.	Ukajj janiw nayarojj amuyaskänti.
Of course, I can’t do that.	Chiqansa, janiw nayax ukham lurañjamäkiti.
You kind of know who it’s going to be.	Jumax mä juk’a yatisktawa khitis ukax utjani.

Maybe I’ll do one someday.	Inas mä urux mä lurañax wakischispa.
But in a small way.	Ukampis mä jiskʼa toqetwa.

For a time things really looked pretty bad.	Mä tiempojj cheqapuniw kunanakas wali jan wali uñnaqäna.

No one is like that.	Janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.
He has been for the past two weeks.	Jupax aka qhipa pä semanaw ukham jikxatasi.
He was a very important person.	Jupajj wali wakiskir jaqënwa.
But this guy doesn't.	Ukampis aka jaqejj janiw uk lurkiti.
He talked about it a little bit.	Jupajj uka toqet mä jukʼa parläna.
I have nothing against it but it doesn’t work for me.	Nayax janiw kunas uka tuqitx utjkituti ukampis janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
I think the situation is pretty clear.	Nayax amuyta kunatix utjki ukax wali qhanawa.
Well, well, this is good.	Suma, suma, akax wali askiwa.
I really mean that.	Chiqpachansa ukham sañ munta.

Here and everywhere.	Aka chiqansa ukat taqi chiqansa.

I did this this year.	Nayax aka marax ukham lurawayta.
He refused and asked if that was enough.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti ukat ukajj wakisispati sasaw jisktʼäna.
Maybe everything else.	Inas taqi kunas.
That was about a year ago.	Ukajj niya mä mara nayraw pasäna.

And it’s not a bad thing.	Ukat janiw jan walïkiti.
I want to leave as well.	Nayax ukhamarakiw sarxañ muni.
He rarely uses it.	Jupajj jukʼakiw ukanak apnaqi.
Well, really anything.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa kunas.
He wants to get out, and he wants to get out now.	Jupax mistuñ muni, ukat jichhax mistuñ muni.

He feels it’s too early.	Jupax wali nayraw sasaw amuyasi.

And so it went on.	Ukat ukhamaw saräna.
But that seems impossible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
I’m still not all myself.	Nayax wali jan taqpach naya pachpaw jikxatastxa.
Tonight, he thought, tonight would be his last.	Jichha arumax, jichha arumax qhipa arumaw sasaw amuyäna.

The heat comes quickly.	Junt’u pachax jank’akiw puri.
Let's take a closer look at what he said there.	Ukan kuntï siskäna uk sum uñjañäni.
The location of the house is perfect.	Uka utax kawkhans utji ukax wali sumawa.
That's all we have to do now.	Jichhajj ukakiw lurañasa.

No one told him to do that.	Janiw khitis jupar ukham luram siskänti.
We went with him.	Jiwasajj jupamp chikaw sarapjjta.
We should do this every year.	Sapa maraw uk lurañasa.
Well, that master bedroom.	Ukhama, uka jach’a ikiñ uta.
The point is as follows.	Uka tuqitxa akham sañ muni.
Every time I feel bad.	Sapa kutiw nayax jan walin jikxatastxa.

But that wasn't all.	Ukampis ukajj janiw taqpach ukhamäkänti.
He doesn't love me.	Jupajj janiw nayar munaskiti.
There's something about it.	Kunas kunas utji.

He died three years ago.	Jupajj kimsa mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
There’s not far to go, there’s nothing to do.	Janiw jaya sarañax utjkiti, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Today, he is doing just about anything or anything.	Jichhürunakanjja, niya taqe kunas jan ukajj kunsa luraski.
It’s really pretty fun actually.	Chiqpachansa wali suma kusiskañawa chiqpachansa.
But all of this was really about it.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj cheqapuniw uka toqet parläna.
I can't do anything about it.	Janiw nayajj kuns lurirjamäkti.
And he can do just that.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw luraspa.
He actually wanted to drive himself, but she refused.	Chiqansa, jupa pachpaw auto apnaqañ munäna, ukampis jupax janiw munkänti.
Too big, maybe.	Sinti jach’a, inas.
Naked, of course.	Q’ala ch’uqi, chiqpachansa.

He decided to walk.	Jupax sarnaqañ amtäna.

You are, of course.	Jumax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.

He was half asleep.	Jupajj chikat ikiskäna.
He felt a little better.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sum jikjjatasïna.
And he was the only one.	Ukat jupa sapakiw utjäna.

Of course, he left immediately.	Chiqansa, jupax jankʼakiw sarxäna.

There was nothing there, really.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkänti, chiqpachansa.

But, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, ukhamänwa.
That is an interesting question.	Uka jisktʼajj wali sumawa.

Maybe even more so.	Inas juk’ampi juk’ampi.
Not yet in the fall.	Janiw jichhakamax jallu pachanx utjkiti.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Kuntï luraski uk janiw yatkiti.

And very happy about it.	Ukat wali kusisitaw uka tuqitxa.
And we have .	Ukat jiwasax .
And this other time.	Ukat aka yaqha kutix.
At the time, the task seemed impossible.	Uka tiemponjja, uka lurañajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I had nothing real to do.	Janiw kuna cheqpach lurañas utjkitänti.
Like he wanted that.	Kunjamtï jupax ukham munkäna ukhama.
He said he didn’t want to.	Jupax janiw munkti sasaw säna.

He declined to elaborate.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp yatiyañ munkänti.
And that is even more surprising.	Ukat ukax jukʼamp muspharkañawa.

This is welcome but not necessary.	Ukax wali askiwa ukampis janiw wakiskiti.

Food is scarce and money is scarce.	Manq’añax juk’akiw utji ukat qullqix juk’akiw utji.
But, that is not the case.	Ukampis, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
You know, he was right.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax chiqaw säna.

So that's what he's doing.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj luraski.
But it doesn’t work tonight.	Ukampis jichha arumax janiw irnaqkiti.
He just asked for it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw mayïna.
This is the right thing to do.	Akax walikïskiwa.
But this, obviously, won’t do.	Ukampis akax, qhanaw, janiw lurkaniti.
But there is no other option.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
So this is the.	Ukhamajj aka.
It would take a whole book to do that.	Uk lurañatakix mä libro taqpach munasispa.

And, it really is.	Ukat, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
No breakfast for you. 	Janiw jumatakix desayuno ukax utjkiti.

I would love to see you there.	Ukan uñjañ wal munta.
Now it comes about once every two hours.	Jichhax niya sapa pä horaw mä kutikiw purini.
He can do nothing for us.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jiwasatak lurkaspati.
But I don't know why.	Ukampis janiw kunatsa uk yatkti.
He knew his name.	Jupajj sutip sum yatïna.
They were so much.	Ukhama wali.
You don't have to make a big deal out of it.	Janiw ukat mä jachʼa lurañ lurañax wakiskiti.
Here’s what’s interesting.	Akax kunas wali askiwa.
But, where do you feel better.	Ukampis, kawkhansa jumajj jukʼamp sum jikjjatasta.
To make matters worse, he actually enjoyed it.	Juk’amp jan wali lurañatakix chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
You can do it yourself if you want.	Jumax munsta ukhax juma pachpaw lurasma.
What will he do in the future?.	¿Kunsa jutïrin lurani?.
The question is whether it is right for me.	Uka jisktʼajj nayatakejj walikïskiti janicha ukawa.
He knew what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk sum yatïna.
He repeated the word silently.	Uka aru amukiw walja kuti arsüna.
But we have something better.	Ukampis jiwasajj jukʼamp sumaw utjistu.
But he didn't understand it.	Ukampis janiw uk amuykänti.
He was never there.	Jupajj janipuniw uka cheqan utjkänti.
I think I should probably go to bed.	Nayax amuyta, inas ikiñar sarañax wakischispa.
I didn’t know anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqit kuns yatkayätti.
But he was still happy to leave.	Ukampis wali kusisitaw sarjjäna.
This isn’t me, obviously.	Akax janiw nayax ukhamäkiti, qhanawa.
No, it doesn't exist right now.	Janiwa, janiw jichhajj utjkiti.
But at the moment, he doesn't know what the future holds.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, jutïrin kunas pasani uk janiw yatkiti.
We’ll do our best.	Jiwasax taqi ch’amampiw lurañäni.
But I want one.	Ukampis nayajj mä munta.

Honestly, it’s just that good.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamakiw wali suma.
He wanted to know what she wanted to know.	Kuntï jupajj yatiñ munkäna uk yatiñwa munäna.
That’s right, actually.	Ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
These are not available.	Ukanakajj janiw utjkiti.
There was nowhere to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkänti.
You don’t have to do that now.	Jichhax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.

Never the latter.	Janipuniw uka qhipa tuqitxa.

I think it’s a good one.	Nayax amuyta, mä suma jaqiwa.
I didn't think that was a good idea.	Janiw ukajj wali askïkaspas ukham amuykayätti.
He told me everything he wanted from her.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupat munta sasaw sitäna.
Every, every, day.	Sapa, sapa, uru.
That’s it, yes.	Ukax, jïsa.
He did nothing himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kuna lurañas lurkänti.
So it kind of happened.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa pasäna.
And then it wasn't.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
There, that is even better.	Ukanjja, ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
He was more mischievous than happy.	Jupajj kusisit sipansa jukʼampiw jan walinak luraskäna.
He likes this very much.	Juparux akax wali askiwa.
It’s called ‘somewhere’.	Ukax ‘kawkhans’ satawa.

You know what happened.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas pasäna.
He’s hot and cold.	Jupax wali junt’u ukat thaya.
He knew a lot about himself.	Jupa pachpat wal yatïna.
Now he felt everything.	Jichhajj taqe kunwa jikjjatasïna.
Someone knocked on the door.	Mayniw punku ch’allt’äna.
I’m going to do my best.	Nayax taqi ch’amampiw lurañ amtasta.

I want a walk by the water.	Uma jak’an mä juk’a sarnaqañ munta.

They are something and nothing at the same time.	Jupanakax mä kunaw ukat janiw kunas pachpa pachanx utjkiti.

He said he didn’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurkti sasaw säna.
I couldn't imagine doing it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurañ jan amuytʼirjamäkti.

And that, too, exists.	Ukat ukax, ukhamarakiw utji.

Do that, don’t do that.	Ukham luram, janiw ukham luramti.
He died that night.	Jupajj uka arumaw jiwjjäna.
Now I want to talk to him about something else.	Jichhajj yaqha toqetwa jupamp parltʼañ munta.
I love mine a lot.	Nayax nayat walpun munasta.

Surprisingly, he quit.	Muspharkañawa, jupax jaytawayi.
We don’t have anything.	Jiwasax janiw kunas utjkiti.
He really wanted something more.	Chiqpachansa jukʼamp kunsa munäna.
I thought it was good.	Nayax wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.

I did everything I could.	Nayajj taqe kunwa lurayäta.

Let's see how long that lasts.	Ukajj qhawqha tiempos utjani uk uñjañäni.
Of course he loved it.	Chiqansa jupax walpun munäna.
He was asleep again.	Jupajj wasitatwa ikiskäna.
Or more than that.	Jan ukax juk’ampi.
This can take years.	Ukajj walja maranakaw pasaspa.
I still have two hours left.	Nayax wali pä horaw utjitu.

Eventually, he says, he feels strong again.	Qhipharux wasitat ch’amampiw jikxatasi, sasaw saraki.
But there is nothing to say.	Ukampis janiw kunas sañjamäkiti.
Well, more or less.	Ukhama, juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
There are things that are necessary.	Kunanakas wakisi.
I’m sorry he did it.	Nayax jupaw ukham luratayna sasaw llakista.
He had no idea what he was going to do.	Kuntï lurañ amtkäna uk janiw amuykänti.
No, there was nothing else to do.	Janiwa, janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
Now I understood that better.	Jichhajj uk jukʼamp sum amuyayäta.
He said it was fine.	Jupax walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
He decided it wasn’t.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amtäna.
I didn't know that at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw uk yatkayätti.
You look like him.	Jumax jupar uñtasit uñnaqaniwa.

It didn't say anything.	Ukajj janiw arskänti.
But he will be there tomorrow.	Ukampis qharüruw jupajj utjani.

I don’t want to hurt him or anything like that.	Janiw jupar jan ukax ukham jan walinak lurañ munkti.
But now I am happy.	Ukampis jichhajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
But tell me about him.	Ukampis jupat yatiyapjjeta.
Therefore, the construction cost is very high.	Ukatwa, lurañ qullqix wali jach’a.
Of course he did.	Chiqansa jupax ukham luräna.
And anyone can do it.	Ukat khitis uk luraspawa.
This is pretty obvious now!.	¡Akax wali qhanaw jichhax!.
All of these were excellent.	Taqe ukanakajj wali sumapunïnwa.

I never wanted that.	Janipuniw ukham munkayätti.
There was nothing unusual about this place.	Aka chiqanx janiw kunas jan uñt’at lurañax utjkänti.
She realized he was watching her.	Jupar uñchʼukiskäna uk amuyasïna.
I had to do it.	Nayax lurañaw wakisïna.
He didn't know everything about her.	Jupajj janiw jupat taqe kun yatkänti.

He took it out.	Jupajj uka apsüna.

But he could have done so with caution.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw uk luraspäna.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.

He never said anything like that.	Janipuniw kunatsa ukham siskänti.

I tried to go to him.	Nayajj jupar sarañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
But, let’s see.	Ukampis, uñjañäni.
He didn't know how to do it.	Kunjamsa lurañsa yatkaspa uk janiw yatkänti.
So he did that.	Ukhamajj ukham luräna.
But he was surprised.	Ukampis jupajj wal muspharäna.
Looks good, feels great.	Suma uñtatawa, wali sumaw jikxatasi.
There really is no reason.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
Then he went to bed.	Ukat ikiñar sarxäna.

She didn't like the man.	Jupajj janiw uka chachar gustkänti.

He said he knew.	Jupax yattwa sasaw säna.
He had nowhere else to go.	Jupajj janiw yaqha cheqar sarañatak utjkänti.
Every single year.	Sapa sapa mara.
So he was like that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
I want to go out with you again.	Nayax jumamp wasitat mistuñ munta.
All or nothing.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas.
No, it was a very quiet day.	Janiwa, uka urux wali amukiw jikxatasïna.

Everything is good for me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.

He will have none of that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkaniti.
They do not know the truth.	Jupanakajj janiw kunatï cheqäki uk yatipkiti.
He is very good to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.

He was very sincere about it.	Jupajj wali taqe chuymaw uka toqet parläna.
But it wasn't what you think it was.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhamäkänti.
That didn’t mean anything.	Ukax janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
This is not the case here.	Aka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkiti.

He doesn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkiti.
I didn't understand that.	Ukjja janiw nayajj amuykayätti.
But that doesn't mean there is nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan kunas utjkiti sañ munkiti.
He wants nothing to do with me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
I hear you talking.	Nayajj jumar parlir istʼta.
He asked me what it was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj sasaw jisktʼitäna.

But then he knew what he had to do.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunsa lurañapa uk sum yatïna.

It was what he wanted.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj munkäna ukawa.

It meant a silence.	Ukajj mä amukiw sañ munäna.

On the one hand, that kind of stupid.	Mä tuqitxa, uka kasta loqhe.

You have to do one of these.	Mä ukham lurañamawa.

It doesn't do that.	Ukajj janiw uk lurkiti.

He worked both ways.	Jupajj panpachaniw irnaqäna.
I want to argue.	Nayax arsuñ munta.
He is still in a state of shock.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
It doesn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
So this is good for that.	Ukhamajj ukatakix akax wali askiwa.
It’s good to go now.	Jichhax sarañax wali askiwa.
But I don't know what he was saying.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna uk janiw yatkti.
I’ve seen it twice, actually.	Nayax pä kutiw uñjta, chiqpachansa.
It was a different world back then.	Uka tiemponjja, yaqha pachaw utjäna.
Who has seen that?.	¿Khitis ukham uñjta?.
I don’t know anything about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns yatkti.
No, nothing yet.	Janiwa, janiw kunas jichhakamax utjkiti.
If you need to do this.	Uka lurañax wakisispa ukhaxa.
He lived with us for many years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw nanakamp chik jakasïna.
He didn't want her anymore, he didn't want to.	Janiw jupar jukʼamp munkänti, janiw munkänti.
I don't think he did.	Janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
Maybe ten.	Inas tunka.
There’s nothing you can do with him.	Janiw kunas jupamp lurañjamäkiti.
I decided not to do it that day.	Uka urux janiw uk lurañ amtawayta.
There was little there.	Ukanx juk’akiw utjäna.
He wanted to know what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk yatiñ munäna.
As much as you want to.	Kunjamtï munkta ukhama.
Because there was nothing.	Kunatix janiw kunas utjkänti.
I saw what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk uñjta.
You may want to sleep all the time.	Inas sapa kuti ikiñ munsta.
What do you want, he asked himself.	¿Kunsa munta, sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But we don't have to do that.	Ukampis jiwasajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I am very grateful to him.	Juparux walpun yuspärta.
This past year has been a great one.	Aka qhipa marax wali jach’a maraw utjawayi.
That is what happened to me.	Ukaw nayatakejj pasäna.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa amuyäna.
I’m not saying anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqit siskti.
Or you find something.	Jan ukajj kuns jikjjatasta.
Well, maybe school.	Ukhama, inas yatiqañ uta.
I don’t have a lot of money.	Nayax janiw walja qullqix utjkituti.
That’s the best food.	Uka suma manq’a.
I want the job.	Nayax uka irnaqäw munta.
There are many hours in the night.	Arumax walja horanakaw utji.
I don’t want to repeat that.	Janiw ukanak wasitat arsuñ munkti.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj sarjjäna.
I don’t know what happened to me.	Janiw yatkti kunas nayamp pasäna.
Now you have to do it yourself.	Jichhax juma pachpaw ukham lurañama.
I want this one.	Nayax akax munta.
Therefore, a question is necessary.	Ukatwa mä jisktʼajj wakisi.
But he didn't know why.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkänti.
But he isn't like that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
One big and one small.	Mä jach’a ukat mä jisk’a.
I don’t want to go to your school.	Nayax janiw jumanakan yatiqañ utar sarañ munkti.
I don’t know how to do it.	Nayax janiw kunjams lurañ yatkti.
Not as much as it needs to be though.	Janiw kunjamtï wakiski ukhamäkiti ukampis.
That’s all anyone sees.	Ukakiw khitis uñji.
I thought he would leave.	Jupaw sarxani sasaw amuyayäta.
It’s better than nothing.	Ukax jan kunas utjki ukat sipansa juk’amp askiwa.
There’s a power.	Mä ch’amaw utji.
The most important thing is that he did a good job.	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa, jupax mä suma irnaqäw lurawayi.
No one said what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw khitis siskänti.
He wanted me to be.	Jupajj nayaruw munäna.
He takes good care of himself.	Jupa pachpaw sum uñji.
Fool, fool, he thought.	Loqhe, loqhe, sasaw amuyäna.
A little bit of it.	Mä jisk’a.
Nothing does anything.	Janiw kunas kuns lurkiti.
Of course, of course.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa.
No, he couldn't talk now.	Janiwa, janiw jichhajj parlañ puedkänti.
I know there’s nothing I can do.	Nayax yattwa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He had done so much.	Jupajj walpun luratayna.
Maybe next year it will be enough.	Inas jutir marax wakischispa.
You know what happened next.	Kunas uka qhepat pasäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
I mean more than that.	Nayax ukat juk’ampi sañ munta.
Looking forward to seeing!.	¡Uñjañ suyaskta!.
He was watching it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukanak uñchʼukiskäna.
I remember it vividly.	Uka toqet wali sum amtaskta.
He understood the words.	Jupajj uka arunak sum amuyäna.
I’m not quite sure, really.	Nayax janiw sum yatkti, chiqpachansa.
I don't know much about that.	Uka toqet janiw sum yatkti.
That’s what it feels like.	Ukaw amuyasi.
He almost said no.	Jupajj niyaw janiw sasaw sitäna.
What does it do.	Kunas lurani.
He asked you to.	Jupaw jumanakar mayïna.
I think I mean that.	Nayax ukham sañ munta sasaw amuyta.
He called them rough and cold.	Jupanakajj qhuru, thaya sasaw jupanakar säna.
He believes this is important.	Ukajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw jupajj amuyi.
I love these things so much.	Ukanak walpun munasta.
It’s beautiful to do there.	Ukan lurañax wali sumawa.
Except there is one thing.	Jan ukasti mä kunaw utji.
I don’t see him happy.	Janiw jupar kusisit uñjkti.
Do you think you can eat that?.	¿Jumax ukham manq’añax utjaspa sasin amuyta?.
I'm not going to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurkäti.
I didn't want to know anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns yatiñ munkayätti.
I know everything about it.	Nayajj taqe kunwa yatta.
That’s exactly what I’m doing.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukham luraskta.
He can do better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa luraspa.
It happened to himself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw pasäna.
But there is one thing.	Ukampis mä kunaw utji.
And he didn't understand what he was feeling.	Ukat kunsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw amuykänti.
He was the one who decided it.	Jupaw uk amtäna.
That we kind of was.	Ukax jiwasax mä juk’a ukhamänwa.
I don't know if that's right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw yatkti.
Of course, he didn’t know what it was.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw kunas ukax uk yatkänti.
But it’s him.	Ukampis jupaw.
There is no school in the town.	Uka markanx janiw yatiqañ utax utjkiti.
I don’t see anything more now.	Jichhax janiw juk’amp kuns uñjkti.
He saw it, he was very happy.	Jupax uñjäna, wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I haven’t said anything yet.	Janiw jichhakamax kuns siskti.
He didn't say that, he never said it.	Jupajj janiw ukham siskänti, janipuniw arskänti.
The answer is yes.	Ukax jïsa ukhamawa.
He thought that was a good thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
There's a little bit of space there.	Ukanx mä juk'a chiqaw utji.
We have a room here.	Jiwasax aka chiqanx mä cuarto ukaniwa.
He didn't want to talk.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
What do you think of it.	Kuns jumax amuyta.
Small amount of money.	Jisk’a qullqi qullqi.
And, of course, he loved her.	Ukat chiqansa, juparux walpun munäna.
He had no idea what that could be.	Kunas ukajj utjaspa uk janiw amuykänti.
That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisi.
That was another week in the top spot.	Ukax yaqha semanaw nayrïr chiqan jikxatasïna.
Not bad, but not all that great.	Janiw jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw taqi uka jachʼa ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to go as soon as possible.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarañ munäna.
Three or more.	Kimsa jan ukax juk’ampi.
I actually went there.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukaruw sarawayta.
And a cold beer.	Ukat mä thaya cerveza.
He seemed reluctant to have the conversation.	Jupajj janis uka parltʼañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
He felt alone.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
I have nothing to say about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns siskti.
Maybe that’s what you need to do.	Inas ukham lurañax wakisispa.
I don’t have anyone.	Janiw khitis utjkituti.
But he did it pretty well.	Ukampis jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
It’s not like that with me.	Nayampejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Another day or two, maybe three.	Yaqha uru jan ukax pä uru, inas kimsa uru.
He knew that very well.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
It’s worth it in the short term.	Mä juk’a pachanx wali askiwa.
It doesn’t matter, he told himself.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
That's what he did.	Ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
Well, it will be.	Ukhamawa, ukhamarakiw utjani.
I want to work on this.	Nayax aka tuqit irnaqañ munta.
I didn’t get a thing.	Janiw mä kuns jikxatkti.
Do whatever you want to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkta uk lurañamawa.
He’s there all the time.	Jupax taqi pachaw ukan jikxatasi.
I don’t know where he is now.	Jichhax kawkhans jikxatasi uk janiw yatkti.
So far, it looks like that.	Jichhakamax, ukhama uñt’atawa.
But it can’t be there.	Ukampis janiw utjkaspati.
He needs some help.	Jupajj mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munaraki.
Something was obvious.	Kunas ukhamänwa qhanaw amuyasïna.
I don’t know where but where.	Janiw kawkhans yatkti jan ukasti kawkhansa.
It takes some work.	Mä jukʼa lurañaw wakisi.
But more needs to be done.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
But it’s really fun.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
Surprisingly, after all.	Muspharkañawa, taqi kunat sipansa.
He was almost as afraid.	Niya jupajj ukhamarakiw ajjsaräna.
Now he decided that he was fine.	Jichhajj jupajj walikïskiwa sasaw amtäna.
I do things that I can’t do.	Kunanaktï jan lurañjamäki ukanak lurañwa yatta.
You can do the same thing.	Jumax ukhamarakiw ukham lurasma.
And, that’s wrong.	Ukat, ukax janiw walïkiti.
He is happy to be around.	Jupajj kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
That’s exciting.	Ukax kusiskañawa.
I had him with me.	Nayajj jupampiw utjäna.
You have to do it first.	Jumaw nayraqat uk lurañama.
Things aren’t as bad as they were twenty years ago.	Kunanakas janiw pä tunk mara nayrax jan walïkiti.
I want him there.	Nayax juparux uka chiqan munta.
I asked him where he was going.	Ukat kawkirus saraskta sasaw jisktʼta.
No one has any idea why or what caused it.	Kunatsa jan ukajj kunas ukham lurawayi uk janiw khitis amuykiti.
That hasn’t happened yet.	Ukax janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkiti.
One is interesting to me.	Maynix nayatakix wali askiwa.
I don't understand what he's saying.	Kuntï siski uk janiw amuykti.
No! 	Janiwa!
I mean yours.	Nayax jumanakan sañ munta.
But is that about it.	Ukampis ¿ukax uka tuqitxa.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurañ munkänti.
That leaves a guitar.	Ukax mä guitarra jaytawayi.
He created them.	Jupaw jupanakar lurawayi.
Very impressive, actually.	Wali muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.
But no matter where you want to go.	Ukampis kawkirus sarañ munsta ukhajja, janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
I love doing work.	Trabajo lurañajj nayatakejj wal gustitu.
Now it’s not any more.	Jichhax janiw juk’ampi.
The bigger nose was better.	Jach’a nayrax juk’amp sumapunïnwa.
There is no one here.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
This was no less surprising.	Ukajj janiw jukʼamp muspharkayätti.
You don’t want to know why someone did what they did.	Kunatsa maynix kuns luräna uk janiw yatiñ munktati.
But I’m not sure if it’s ‘okay’ or not.	Ukampis ‘walikïskiti’ janicha uk janiw sum yatkti.
Just like you said.	Kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukhama.
Until he wasn’t.	Jisk’a jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
That's what happened.	Ukhamaw ukajj pasäna.
I am really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wal kusista.
After all, he spoke his mind.	Taqe kunat sipansa, jupajj kuntï amuyki uk arsüna.
It’s nice to do them here.	Aka chiqan jupanakar lurañax wali askiwa.
The country is beautiful.	Uka markanx wali sumawa.
He hasn’t said anything yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax kuns arskänti.
Yes, he was a fool.	Jïsa, jupajj mä loqhe jaqënwa.
He didn’t say that today.	Jichhürunakanx janiw ukham arskänti.
I don't understand what he did.	Uka luratapat janiw sum amuykti.
Of course, this is very important.	Chiqansa, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
I'm not saying that.	Nayajj janiw uk siskti.
I don't know exactly.	Janiw sum yatkti.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp parlañ munkiti.
The weather looks good.	Pachax wali suma uñtatawa.
Very nice, very nice.	Wali suma, wali suma.
I’m sure he’s doing the same with you.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax jumamp chikaw ukham luraski.
I decided to give it up.	Nayax uk jaytañ amtawayta.
I did the right thing.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurawayta.
I barely understood what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk jukʼakiw amuyayäta.
And at the time, that didn't matter.	Ukat uka tiemponjja, ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
If you want to.	Jumax munsta ukhaxa.
No one needed to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañap wakiskänti.
I had to do what was right.	Kunatï walïki uk lurañaw wakisïna.
I don't see the problem.	Janiw uka jan waltʼäw uñjkti.
I don’t know where, really.	Janiw kawkhans uk yatkti, chiqpachansa.
It doesn’t work for me at all.	Nayatakix janiw kunatsa irnaqkiti.
We’re the ones who appreciate it.	Jiwasax ukax wali askiwa.
I know it’s okay.	Nayax yattwa ukax walikïskiwa.
I need to make them smaller.	Nayax jupanakar jisk’a lurañaw wakisi.
Still no one noticed.	Wali jan khitis amuyaskänti.
How real is irrelevant.	Kunjamsa cheqpach ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I would say three hours.	Nayax kimsa horaw sañ munta.
I don’t see him anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans jupar uñjkti.
You can’t do well tomorrow.	Qhipürux janiw sum lurañjamäkiti.
It takes some time.	Mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
But that didn't seem to be the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
I'm not going to go.	Janiw sarkäti.
He meant it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uk sañ munäna.
Nothing felt like that.	Janiw kunas ukham amuyaskänti.
Yes, absolutely, absolutely.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa.
But let’s do it differently today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa yaqha tuqit lurañäni.
He wants to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa munta.
There was no one about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqit utjkänti.
It's actually fun, kind of, he says.	Chiqansa, wali kusiskañawa, mä kasta, sasaw saraki.
I’ve been to this event almost every year.	Nayax niya sapa maraw aka tantachäwir sarawayta.
We have an opportunity.	Jiwasax mä oportunidad ukaniwa.
He was really looking at it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
That’s what he really likes.	Ukax juparux chiqpachapuniw gusti.
He's a very tall guy.	Jupax wali jach'a jaqiwa.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
I’m still yours .	Nayax wali jumanakan .
So it’s your responsibility.	Ukhamajj jumanakan lurañamawa.
I was struck by something.	Nayax mä kunaw chuym ch’allxtayäna.
He did everything right.	Jupajj taqe kunwa sum luräna.
He just keeps riding.	Jupax ukhamakiw kayuk saraski.
And so he is.	Ukat ukhamaw jupax.
It also means that what we didn’t do didn’t exist.	Ukat jan lurapkta ukax janiw utjkänti sañ munaraki.
So it was kind of like that.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.	Ukajj janiw jan utjkiti sañ munkiti.
He’s kind of weird.	Jupax mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
We have a great place for that.	Ukatakix mä jach’a chiqaw utjistu.
If you need or want anything please let me know.	Jumatix kuns munsta jan ukax munsta ukhax yatiyapxita.
I don’t think you really want me.	Nayax janiw nayax chiqpachapuni munktati sasaw amuyasta.
I’m not saying never.	Nayax janipuniw sañ munkti.
There are two things you can do.	Ukanx pä lurañaw utji.
Or rather he spoke.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sum parläna.
He had been doing this for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham luraskäna.
It came quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw jutäna.
There will be nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkaniti.
I’m looking forward to having dinner with him.	Nayax jupamp manq’añ suyt’askta.
Thank you very much, thank you very much.	Walpun yuspärta, walpun yuspärta.
There is a place for you.	Jumatakix mä chiqaw utji.

It took me about half an hour.	Ukajj nayatakejj niya chika horaw munasïna.
And it’s even hotter.	Ukat juk’amp junt’u.
He meant to say that.	Jupajj uk sañ munäna.
It’s far, far away.	Ukax wali jaya, wali jaya.
I did this to do just that.	Ukham lurañatakiw ukham lurawayta.
He himself had done so the morning before.	Jupa pachpaw nayra alwajj ukham luratayna.
No, he was a character.	Janiwa, jupajj mä jaqënwa.
I didn't say anything to him.	Janiw nayajj jupar kuns siskti.
I heard him say it myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar ukham siskäna uk istʼta.
They didn't need to.	Jupanakajj janiw wakiskänti.
He couldn't talk to us.	Jupajj janiw nanakamp parlañ puedkänti.
I want to know who did it.	Khitis uk luräna uk yatiñ munta.
So what are you waiting for?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa suytʼaskta?.
And he didn't want to hurt her.	Ukat janiw jupar jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Janiw uk lurirjamäkti sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.
I can’t tell you.	Janiw nayax sañjamäkiti.
No one can do it for you.	Janiw khitis jumar lurkaspati.
He was successful at it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa sum sarnaqäna.
They are rarely available.	Jupanakax juk’akiw utji.
I really enjoyed this moment.	Chiqpachansa aka pachax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
So what happened next.	Ukhamajj kunas qhepat pasäna.
He’s nice, but he’s a little rough.	Jupax wali sumawa, ukampis mä juk’a qhuru jaqiwa.
Yes, that is not the case.	Jïsa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's the worst part.	Uka jan wali chiqa.
I have nowhere to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkituti.
He thinks it’s worth it.	Jupax wali askiwa sasaw amuyi.
Time really goes fast.	Chiqpachansa tiempox jankʼakiw saraski.
Back then, it doesn't work today.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw jichha tiempon irnaqkiti.
In fact, he was.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa.
I finally said no.	Qhepatjja, janiw sasaw sista.
He did exactly that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham luräna.
I don’t remember who told me.	Janiw khitis sitäna uk amtaskti.
He sucked in the air.	Jupax thaya chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
Well, that’s it.	Ukhama, ukax ukhamawa.
He saw it in the sky.	Jupajj uk uñjäna.
Nothing in the past.	Janiw kunas nayra tiempon utjkänti.
He died the way he wanted to.	Jupajj kunjamtï munkäna ukhamarakiw jiwjjäna.
He came alone.	Jupa sapakiw jutäna.
I appreciate it!!.	Nayax wali askiwa!!.
I’m sorry, but .	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis .
He loves them so much.	Jupajj jupanakar wal munasi.
And I’m happy with it.	Ukat nayax kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
I didn’t want anyone to see it.	Janiw khitis uñjañ munkayätti.
I’m right here with you.	Nayax jumamp chikaw akanktxa.
People then again.	Jaqinakax uka pachax wasitatwa.

But he didn't, he never did.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkänti, janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I don't know what the problem is.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk yatkti.
I am still happy today.	Jichhürunakanxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But that can't be the case here.	Ukampis ukajj janiw aka cheqan utjkaspati.
We have less and less.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw utjistu.
Strangely, when I knew something was wrong.	Muspharkañawa, kunapachatï kunas jan walïki uk yatkayäta ukhaxa.
They are nothing to me.	Jupanakajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa.
But there was something better.	Ukampis jukʼamp sumaw utjäna.
He wasn't sure why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I just realized something.	Jichhakiw kuns amuyayäta.
I say people.	Nayax jaqinakax sasaw sista.
I’m here for the first time.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw akanktxa.
One came again the next day.	Maynix qhipürux wasitat jutäna.
Something else needed to be done.	Yaqha lurañaw wakisïna.
It’s so far away, something unusual.	Ukax wali jaya, kunas jan uñt’atawa.
That’s what was needed.	Ukaw wakisïna.
And of course, he loved it.	Ukat chiqpachansa, jupax ukaruw munasïna.
Something better than me.	Kunas nayat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Not once did he do that.	Janiw mä kutis ukham lurkänti.
I don’t do the same thing over and over again.	Janiw mä pachpa lurañanak walja kuti lurkti.
I never wanted to, you know.	Janipuniw munkayätti, jumax yatisktawa.
I hope everything works out for you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix askïspawa sasaw suyt’askta.
Someone else is coming.	Mayniw jutani.
So a little bit too.	Ukhama mä juk’a ukhamaraki.
He's a good guy.	Jupajj sumwa amuyi.
I still do this on a regular basis.	Nayax wali sapa kutiw ukham luraskta.

He’s the last one.	Jupax qhipa uñt’atawa.

I said someone has to do something.	Nayax mayniw kuns lurañapa sasaw sista.
This is a man who knows how to get things done.	Akax mä jaqiwa, jupax kunjams lurañanak lurañ yati.
He said he didn’t remember.	Janiw amtaskti sasaw säna.
I’ll do it for you.	Nayax uk lurañäni.
I created the moment.	Nayaw uka pachax lurawayta.
We’re not going to.	Jiwasax janiw.
I really didn’t have anything else to do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw yaqha lurañax utjkitänti.
Of course no one can do that.	Chiqansa janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I knew he would.	Jupajj uk lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
I don't remember much about it.	Uka toqet janiw sinti amtaskti.
There is no other secret.	Janiw yaqha jamasat utjkiti.
I don't want to go to you.	Janiw nayajj jumar sarañ munkti.
But now it doesn't matter.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kunäkisa.
And now he doesn’t know anything.	Ukat jichhax janiw kuns yatkiti.
But you can’t say, you can’t.	Ukampis janiw sañjamäkiti, janiw sañjamäkiti.
And of course, it will.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukham lurañaw wakisini.
He stared at her for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow uñchʼukiskäna.
It’s always hot.	Ukax sapa kutiw junt’u.
Or maybe yes, but you don't have it.	Jan ukajj inas jïsa, ukampis janiw jumanakan utjkiti.
So he said drink.	Ukatwa jupax umañ säna.
We have to do both.	Panpachaniw lurañasa.
I felt like something was good.	Nayax kunas askïspa ukhamaw jikxatasiyäta.
That's not a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw walïkiti.
It was a truly amazing night.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ arumaw utjäna.
And that is what he did.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
I would rather do that than anything else.	Nayajj taqe kunat sipansa uk lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
But I wasn’t too surprised.	Ukampis janiw sinti muspharkayätti.
That was two years ago.	Ukajj pä mara nayraw pasäna.
I know that doesn't matter.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa uk yattwa.
Do as much as you can.	Kunjamtï lurañjamäki uk luram.
I know how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj amuyi uk sum yatta.
I've seen it.	Nayajj uk uñjta.
Breakfast is welcome.	Desayuno ukaxa wali askiwa.
Now you have to do something.	Jichhax kuns lurañamawa.
So there won't be that. 	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj utjkaniti. 
But the man is beautiful.	Ukampis uka jaqejj wali sumawa.
The sight of the	Ukham uñjasajj .
I knew it would happen one day.	Mä urux ukham lurasiñap yatiyätwa.
We’re going to do something.	Jiwasax kuns lurañäni.
These are not worth it.	Ukanakajj janiw kunäkisa.
It wasn’t in the area.	Janiw uka cheqan utjkänti.
He was the first to welcome them.	Jupaw nayraqat jupanakar katoqäna.
Or whatever it is.	Jan ukax kunas ukax utji.
Do your homework.	Tareanak lurañamawa.
But he couldn't do it himself.	Ukampis janiw jupa pachpajj uk lurañ puedkänti.
He looked very happy.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
But no, not really.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
I don’t know why, really.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, chiqpachansa.
Two more and more.	Pä juk’ampi.
He used to be someone else.	Jupajj nayrajj yaqha jaqënwa.
This is not economically viable.	Ukax qullqi tuqitx janiw askïkiti.
That rarely happened.	Ukax jukʼakiw pasäna.
That’s obvious.	Ukax qhanawa.
They are not .	Jupanakax janiw .
But I wasn't sure what he was doing.	Ukampis kuntï jupajj luraskäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
Breakfast was excellent.	Desayuno ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
He is what we need.	Jupaw kunatï jiwasatak wakiski ukawa.
He didn't know too much about her.	Jupajj janiw jupat sinti sum yatkänti.
Wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly.	Taqi chuyma ukat taqi chuyma.
It's funny why I don't know.	Kunatsa uk jan yatkta ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
Something happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna.
Of course, the reality is quite the opposite.	Chiqansa, kunatï cheqäki ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is someone who wants to talk to you.	Ukanjja, mayniw jumamp parltʼañ muni.
A week later.	Mä semana qhepatjja.
He knows that.	Jupax uk yattwa.
I didn’t want to tell him.	Janiw nayax jupar yatiyañ munkayätti.
I’ve done it again.	Nayax wasitat lurawayta.
Well, you know about it.	Ukhama, jumax uka tuqit yatisktawa.
It's going well.	Suma saraski.
So far he has done just that.	Jichhakamax jupax ukhamarakiw lurawayi.
Now I know how to use you.	Jichhajj kunjamsa jumanakar apnaqañ yatta.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Nayax janiw yatkti, janiw yatiñ munkti.
I didn't have all of that.	Nayajj janiw ukanak taqe kunas utjkitänti.
But the question came quickly.	Ukampis uka jisktʼajj jankʼakiw purinïna.
He says he won’t go.	Jupax janiw sarkäti sasaw saraki.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Jan ukax khitirus, uka tuqitxa.
It’s weird, you know.	Ukax muspharkañawa, jumax yatisktawa.
But the whole process is amazing.	Ukampis taqe uka lurañajj wali muspharkañawa.
Except, this time, it wasn’t.	Jan ukasti, aka kutix, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Maybe you think so.	Inas jumax ukham amuyta.
As recently as last week.	Jichhakiw kunjamtï pasïr semanan luraskäna ukhama.
I thought it would be good for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
His didn’t do that.	Jupan janiw ukham lurkänti.
I didn’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurkti.
It’s pretty obvious to you.	Jumatakix ukax wali qhanawa.
I don't see it properly.	Nayajj janiw sum uñjkti.
Let me know if you like anything here.	Aka chiqanx kunas jumatakix wali askïspa ukhax yatiyapxita.
He hit two people.	Jupax pä jaqiruw ch’allt’äna.
But it can happen.	Ukampis ukham pasaspa.
They certainly were.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
But he was very vocal.	Ukampis jupajj walpun arsüna.
He didn't think it was necessary.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasin amuykänti.
I am very grateful for that.	Ukajj walpun yuspärta.
But then he spoke again.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa parläna.
And he told me he liked the new me.	Ukat machaq nayajj gustitu sasaw sitäna.
I’m tall and thin.	Nayax jach’a ukat jisk’a jaqïtwa.
Really, somehow.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamatsa.
He took it very seriously.	Jupajj uk wali sumwa uñjäna.
I never realized it until now.	Jichhakamajj janipuniw uk amuykayätti.
Or at least it was for me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He knows what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk sum yati.
At the time, I thought that was the right thing to do.	Uka tiemponjja, ukajj wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
He notified the police.	Jupajj policiaruw yatiyäna.
That night the man came again.	Uka arumax wasitatwa uka jaqix jutäna.
He didn't want to leave her.	Jupajj janiw jupar jaytañ munkänti.
It was perfect for that.	Ukatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
I just can't figure it out.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit amuytʼirjamäkti.
He asked me about it somehow.	Kunjamatsa uka tuqit jiskt’itu.
And now there’s no food at home.	Ukat jichhax janiw manq’añax utan utjkiti.
Beer and wine.	Cerveza ukat vino.
But the truth remained unclear.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw amuyaskänti.
He didn’t realize it.	Janiw amuyaskänti.
For a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempo.
He didn't know but he thought he did.	Jupajj janiw yatkänti ukampis yattwa sasaw amuyasïna.
He did what he did well.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk sumwa luräna.
He’s the one who made her.	Jupaw jupar luratayna.
Everything is very quiet, he said.	Taqi kunas wali amukiw sasaw säna.
I want to work on that.	Nayax uka tuqit irnaqañ munta.
It was just as he said it would be.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukhamänwa.
He looked very lonely.	Jupajj wali sapakiw uñnaqäna.
I can do it better than him .	Nayajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa uk lurasmati .
How are you doing.	Kunjamatsa jumax.
So let’s see .	Ukhamajj uñjañäni .
And he did it several more times.	Ukat jukʼamp walja kutiw ukham luräna.
Why would you want to be like that.	¿Kunatsa ukham munasma.
That is what he has to do.	Ukaw jupajj lurañapa.
You know how to do it.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjamsa lurasma.
You can do that now.	Jichhajj ukham lurasma.
Now it’s in a mess.	Jichhax mä jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
He saw it for himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk uñjäna.
There was this one.	Ukanjja aka mayniw utjäna.
He knows exactly what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
That is the best thing for you.	Ukaw jumatakejj jukʼamp askejja.
You don’t need good people.	Janiw suma jaqinakax wakiskiti.
But that's okay, he told himself.	Ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
Whatever you want.	Kuntï jumajj munkta uk.
You can easily do this at home.	Utan jankʼakiw uk lurasma.
He wanted it for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow wal munäna.
Too much, in fact.	Sinti jach’a, chiqpachansa.
He didn't like her any less.	Jupajj janiw jupar jukʼamp gustkänti.
Thirty years later, he did.	Kimsa tunka mara qhepatjja, ukhamwa luräna.
He knows what happened better than any of them.	Kunatï paskäna uk jupajj taqe ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp sum yati.
Everyone knows everything in this country.	Taqinipuniw aka markanx taqi kun yatipxi.

There was something wrong with him in the room.	Kuna jan waliw jupamp chika cuarto manqhan utjäna.
He said he wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkti sasaw säna.
But, it doesn’t work for me.	Ukampis, janiw nayatakix irnaqkiti.
It’s hard not to eat.	Jan manq’añax ch’amawa.
I know what he wants and needs.	Kuntï jupajj munki ukat kunsa munki uk sum yatta.
Something is definitely wrong.	Kunas chiqpachapuniw jan walïki.
So far it seems to work.	Jichhakamax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
He never wants to see them again.	Janipuniw jupanakar mayamp uñjañ munkiti.
They don’t know.	Jupanakajj janiw yatipkiti.
There is nothing more to do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkiti.
All of this happened long ago.	Taqe ukanakajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
I don’t want to get into it, though.	Janiw nayax ukar mantañ munkti, jan ukasti.
I don’t remember that.	Nayax janiw uk amtkti.
For the first time he thought.	Nayrïr kutiw jupajj amuyäna.
This happened the night he died.	Ukajj uka arumaw jiwjjäna ukhajj pasäna.
And this other thing, too.	Ukat aka yaqha tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
He couldn't sleep.	Jupajj janiw ikiñ puedkänti.
He was talking about real life.	Jupajj cheqpach jakañ toqetwa parläna.
But you need to do it quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk lurañama.
I was really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
There was never that time.	Janiw kunapachas uka tiempojj utjkänti.
I can't believe it.	Janiw nayajj iyaw sañjamäkiti.

I absolutely need it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wakisi.
He can’t have it both ways.	Jupax janiw pä tuqit ukax utjkaspati.
Afterwards, he felt better.	Uka qhepatjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
The more anyone does, the less likely they are to understand it.	Khitis jukʼamp kuns luraski ukhajja, janiw uk sum amuykiti.
There are no good people.	Janiw suma jaqinakax utjkiti.
And you still feel good.	Ukat wali sumaw jikxatastaxa.
But it’s not what you want.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
No one will do that.	Janiw khitis uk lurkaniti.
He says he won’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurkäti sasaw saraki.
I doubt anyone will.	Khitis ukham lurani sasaw pächasta.
Now it's pretty amazing.	Jichhajj wali muspharkañawa.

There’s a film out there.	Ukanx mä película ukaw utji.
You want it to do just about anything you can think of.	Niya taqe kuntï jumajj amuykayäta uk lurañapatakiw munta.

In a way it was, but not really.	Mä tuqitxa ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkänti.
But somehow he knew.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk yatïna.
He tells her to.	Jupax juparux siwa.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
A young man said.	Mä waynax sänwa.

And this is wrong.	Ukat akax janiw walïkiti.

Beyond that, he didn't do anything.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kuns lurkänti.

This happened two or three times.	Ukajj pä jan ukajj kimsa kutiw pasäna.

And they have nothing on him.	Ukat jupanakax janiw kunas juparux utjkiti.

I want to do the right thing.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañwa munta.
None of it could do it.	Janiw kunas ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
He did this morning.	Jupax jichhür alwaw uk luratayna.
Maybe you can make a character out of him.	Inas jupat mä chachar lurasma.
He didn't want to talk about anything more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunatsa parlañ munkänti.
He accepted the responsibility wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw uka lurañanak katoqäna.
He did these things because he had to.	Ukanak lurañajj wakisïna ukatwa luräna.
I have the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw utjitu.
Of course, that’s not the case here.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw akanx ukhamäkiti.

It’s deep inside itself, too.	Ukanx jupa pachpaw wali manqhan jikxatasi, ukhamaraki.
There was certainly room for improvement.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp sum lurañatakix mä chiqaw utjäna.
This is not possible yet.	Ukax janiw jichhakamax lurañjamäkiti.
That’s how long you’ve got.	Ukhamaw qawqha pachas jumax jikxatasïta.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkti.

I think that’s the right thing to do.	Nayax amuyta, ukax chiqaw sañ muni.

He sat down with me and really talked about it.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw qontʼasïna ukat cheqapuniw uka toqet parläna.
These are the most important things.	Ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
And nothing can do it.	Ukat janiw kunas lurkaspati.

So let us know in advance.	Ukhamajj nayratpach yatiyapjjeta.

It was too early for this, but it had to be done.	Ukatakix wali nayraw ukham lurañax wakisïna, ukampis lurañaw wakisïna.
Obviously he didn’t want to get involved.	Qhanaw jupax janiw ukar mantañ munkänti.
For a while he said no more.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw jukʼamp arskänti.
Not the other way around !!!.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa !!!.
I made my coffee.	Nayax café lurayäta.

But that doesn't seem like a good idea.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wali askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.

It used to be that way.	Ukham nayrajj ukhamänwa.
It’s a strange and fascinating thing.	Ukax mä muspharkañ ukat wali muspharkañawa.

I’m pretty sure he doesn’t.	Nayax wali sum amuyta, jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.

Good kind, actually.	Suma kasta, chiqpachansa.

He didn't say what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa siskänti.

That’s all there is to it.	Ukakiw uka tuqitxa.

I think that was something else.	Ukajj yaqha toqetwa parläna sasaw amuyta.
He saw her for many years.	Walja maranakaw jupar uñjäna.

What, he didn’t know.	Kunas, jupax janiw yatkänti.
In a country somewhere.	Mä markan kawkhansa.
He looked very, very happy.	Jupax wali, wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
I'm a .	Nayax mä .
I don’t like it here.	Nayax janiw akanx gustkituti.
To my surprise, there is none.	Nayatakix muspharkañawa, janiw kunas utjkiti.
I think the other one is pretty simple.	Nayax amuyta, maynix wali ch’amawa.
That was nowhere to be found.	Ukajj janiw kawkhans utjkänti.
Let’s take a look at him.	Jupar uñjañäni.
Time goes by so fast.	Tiempojj wali jankʼakiw pasaski.
Anything wrong is wrong and wrong.	Kunatix jan walïki ukax janiw walïkiti ukat janiw walïkiti.
And he doesn't know how long it will last.	Ukat qhawqha tiempos utjani uk janiw yatkiti.
This happened to me recently.	Jichhakiw ukajj nayar pasäna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ukajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
There was only one for that.	Ukatakejj mä sapakiw utjäna.
For me, that was never a problem.	Nayatakejj ukajj janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
There’s a lot of energy out there.	Walja ch’amaw ukanx utji.
I was rather surprised.	Nayajj jukʼampiw muspharta.
Because he’s human.	Kunatix jupax jaqiwa.
You’re the one who says that.	Jumaw ukham sista.
Of course it’s not right.	Chiqansa janiw walïkiti.
No, you don’t have to do everything alone.	Janiwa, janiw sapakix taqi kun lurañamäkiti.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Janiw kunas pasani uk yatkti.
He gave it to me.	Jupaw uk churäna.
All of this is very important to me.	Taqi ukanakax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
He lives like that.	Jupajj ukham jakasi.
That will be this.	Ukax akax utjani.
I decided to do some research on this.	Uka tuqit mä juk’a yatxatañ amtawayta.
He was staring at it in disgust.	Jupajj jan wali amuyumpiw uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
I don't remember any more.	Janiw jukʼamp amtaskti.
It was really about something.	Chiqpachansa kuna tuqitsa parläna.
They really know how to work.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa kunjams irnaqañ yatipxi.
They don’t know where to go.	Jupanakax janiw kawkirus sarañ yatipkiti.
He was not long in the country.	Jupajj janiw jaya tiempojj uka markan utjkänti.
Which obviously did.	Ukajj qhanaw ukham luräna.
You know where you want to eat, just let us know.	Jumax yatisktawa kawkhans manq’añ munta, ukhamakiw yatiyapxita.
He seems to be a real person.	Jupajj cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
This is often not the case.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
There is something really wrong.	Chiqpachansa jan waliw utji.
Of course, that is your responsibility.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax jumanakan lurañamawa.
You never knew that.	Janipuniw uk yatkayätati.
It just feels like it.	Ukax ukhamakiw jikxatasi.
I know for sure.	Nayax chiqaw yatta.
I realize that now.	Uk jichhajj amuyasta.
He actually talked to her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupamp parläna.
Or what he was doing.	Jan ukajj kunsa jupajj luraskäna.
Same great, almost.	Pachpa jach’a, niya.
There was less more.	Ukanx juk’akiw juk’amp utjäna.
I don’t think he’s doing anything wrong.	Nayax janiw kunas jupax jan wali luratapat siskti.
I didn’t tell him anything.	Janiw kuns jupar siskti.
Not really, she said.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupax säna.
It’s funny how things are.	Kunjamsa kunanakas utji uk wali muspharkañawa.
I hope that means both.	Ukax panpachaniw sañ muni sasaw suyt’askta.
It happened quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw pasäna.
I really want to do that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk lurañ munta.
I loved it there.	Ukanjja, walpun munasta.
It may take some time.	Inas mä jukʼa tiempojj munasispa.
Please tell me something.	Mä yatiyapxita.
I mean absolutely.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw sañ munta.
A cold beer.	Mä thaya cerveza.
And that says a lot.	Ukat ukax walpun arsu.
It’s hard, it’s hard.	Ukax ch’amawa, ukax ch’amawa.
After that, it wasn't.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
A spacious, comfortable and very comfortable place.	Mä jach’a, suma ukat wali suma chiqa.
But he didn't say anything else.	Ukampis janiw yaqha arunak arskänti.
You are an amazing woman.	Jumax wali muspharkañ warmiwa.
He saw movement in the distance.	Jupax jaya chiqan sarnaqañ uñjäna.
I didn’t expect to do that.	Janiw uk lurañ suykayätti.
They are, of course.	Jupanakax, chiqpachansa.
Because we don’t exist.	Kunatix janiw jiwasax utjkiti.
And he had no idea how much time had passed before that.	Ukat qhawqha tiempos uka nayrajj paskäna uk janiw amuykänti.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Ukampis janiw jan walïkiti.
It's coming to me.	Nayaruw jutani.
Which he accepted.	Ukajj jupajj katoqäna.
But this will happen too.	Ukampis akax ukhamarakiw pasani.
But he did just that.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
Sure, there could be one of those.	Chiqpachansa, uka tuqitxa mayniw utjaspa.
That is exactly what happened.	Ukajj cheqapuniw pasäna.
I’ve decided.	Nayax amtawayta.
Or try to do something about it.	Jan ukajj uka toqet kun lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
I don’t understand it, and I never did.	Janiw nayax uk amuykti, ukat janipuniw amuyirïkti.
I don't do that well.	Nayajj janiw uk sum lurkti.
Tell me who did it.	Khitis uk luräna uk yatiyapjjeta.
He immediately started the ordeal.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka jan waltʼäwejj qalltäna.
I don't really think so.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun ukham amuykti.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutiw utji.
It’s moving faster than anything else.	Ukax taqi kunat sipansa juk’amp jank’akiw sarnaqaski.
And of course, he was hungry.	Ukat chiqpachansa, manqʼat awtjataw jikxatasïna.
But it will have to be done.	Ukampis ukajj lurañaw wakisini.
Now the eye is more visible.	Jichhajj nayrajj jukʼampiw uñjasi.
She is a man-like woman.	Jupax chachar uñtasit warmiwa.
He said he loved me.	Jupajj nayat walpun munasta sasaw säna.
He didn't want to go there.	Jupajj janiw ukar sarañ munkänti.
I can't think of it.	Janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
But the night is still clear.	Ukampis arumax wali qhanawa.
I wonder where you are.	Kawkhansa jumax jikxatasïta sasaw jisktʼasta.
I was so happy to do it.	Uk lurasajj walpun kusista.
It doesn’t cost me anything.	Nayatakix janiw kuna qullqis munaskiti.
Why, it doesn't matter.	Kunatsa, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
Bigger than you know.	Jumajj yatkayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
I really don’t want to see them.	Chiqpachansa janiw jupanakar uñjañ munkti.
I want more time.	Nayax juk’amp tiempo munta.
You will be the future.	Jumaw jutïrin utjani.
But he was still happy.	Ukampis jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There’s truth in it.	Ukanx chiqaw utji.
I knew how he behaved.	Kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatiyäta.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was already doing very well.	Jupajj niyaw wali sum luraskäna.
It’s there to go.	Ukax sarañatakiw utji.
He didn't quite say it, though.	Jupajj janiw uk sum arskänti, ukampis.
He said something else.	Jupax yaqha arunak arsüna.
And then he did it again.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa uk luräna.
Nobody, nothing but snow.	Janiw khitis, janiw kunas jan ukasti ch’uqi.
There are two ways to do this.	Akax pä lurañaw utji.
Or he began to.	Jan ukajj qalltäna.
It doesn’t work everywhere.	Janiw taqi chiqan irnaqkiti.
Or better is worse.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sumaw jukʼamp jan wali.
So why is it.	Ukhamajj kunatsa.
But, you know there’s a reason why.	Ukampis, jumax yatisktawa kunatsa ukax utji kunatix.
It worked well there.	Ukanx wali sum irnaqäna.
As much as anything can be done.	Kunjamtï kunas lurañjamäki ukhama.
You don’t have to do that.	Janiw uk lurañamäkiti.
He did it very well .	Jupajj wali sumwa luräna .
I don’t know how he knows, but he does.	Kunjamsa yati uk janiw yatkti, ukampis yati.
What does it matter’.	Kunas ukajj wakisi’.
I don’t know what to do with them.	Jupanakar kuna lurañas utjaspa uk janiw yatkti.
But really, like that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukhama.
You don’t want to see it through.	Jumax janiw uka tuqit uñjañ munktati.
And he knows it all too well.	Ukat jupax wali sum yati.
I felt really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
He just can’t be here.	Jupa sapakiw akanx janiw utjkaspati.
I am not saying anything one way or the other.	Janiw mä tuqitsa ni yaqha tuqitsa kunsa siskti.
She’s a great big woman.	Jupax jach’a jach’a warmiwa.
There was very little energy.	Ukanx wali juk’a ch’amaw utjäna.
But it was okay.	Ukampis walikïskiwa.
He never did anything right.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns sum lurkänti.
The weather is better today.	Jichhürunakanxa pachax juk’amp sumawa.
I didn’t want to do that though.	Janiw nayax ukham lurañ munkayätti ukampis.
Like that time ago.	Kunjamtï uka tiempojj nayrajj paskäna ukhama.
But that was a long time ago.	Ukampis ukajj wali nayraw pasäna.
Not every night, of course.	Janiw sapa arumax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Everyone likes him.	Taqiniruw juparux gusti.
Both, he thought.	Panpachaniw sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He decided to do what he did.	Jupajj kuntï lurkäna uk lurañwa amtäna.
Maybe he 's .	Inas jupajj .
That doesn't mean that's a good thing.	Ukajj janiw ukajj wali askïkaspas ukham sañ munkiti.
In fact, that's what he wants.	Chiqansa, ukax kuntï jupax munki ukawa.
And he’s a nice guy.	Ukat jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He is the.	Jupax uka...
But it took time to do so.	Ukampis uk lurañatakix tiempow munasïna.
What worked, worked.	Kunas irnaqäna, irnaqäna.
There will be more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼampiw utjani.
I loved it so much.	Ukajj walpun munasïna.
He was a very happy man.	Jupajj wali kusisit jaqënwa.
A bad word, too.	Mä jan wali aru, ukhamaraki.
You’ve definitely got it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw ukax jikxatastaxa.
He’s just done it.	Jupax ukhamakiw lurawayi.
That’s how it’s going.	Ukhamaw ukax saraski.
I’ve done exactly that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayta.
He did it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw ukham luräna.
But no one noticed.	Ukampis janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
It’s something that you have.	Ukax mä kunaw kunatix jumax utjki ukawa.
So much better, maybe.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askïspawa, inas.
They know this entrance.	Jupanakax aka mantañ yatipxi.
It's the.	Ukax uka...
This coffee is delicious.	Aka café ukaxa wali sumawa.
I don't mean you.	Janiw nayajj jumar sañ munkti.
He does this all the time.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham luraski.
I didn’t want to leave it there again.	Janiw mayamps ukar jaytañ munkayätti.
I really don’t want to see the book again.	Chiqpachansa janiw mayamps uka libro uñjañ munkti.
I’m not going anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarkti.
Someone didn’t want him here.	Maynix janiw jupar akan munkänti.
He couldn't talk on the phone for long.	Jupajj janiw walja tiempo telefonot parlañ puedkänti.
You don’t want to.	Jumax janiw munktati.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkayätti.
I would really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askïspawa.
Now it happens once a week.	Jichhajj semanan mä kutiw ukham pasäna.
I don’t miss once a week.	Janiw semanan mä kutis jan sarkti.
But he says a couple of dumb things.	Ukampis jupax mä pä amukiw arsu.
That is the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
Honestly, I like it more.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼampiw ukax gustitu.
He said he loved it.	Jupajj uk walpun munta sasaw säna.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali sumaw sañ muni.
But, obviously, that’s not the case.	Ukampis, qhanaw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He decided to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw lurañ amtäna.
I’m a big guy.	Nayax jach’a jaqïtwa.
But he didn't want to know.	Ukampis jupajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
There was no way I was going to do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk lurañajj utjkänti.
Or whoever it was.	Jan ukajj khitïnsa ukajja.
The restaurant is beautiful.	Uka manq’añ utax wali sumawa.
But that is not the case here.	Ukampis janiw aka cheqan ukhamäkiti.
He could have done it.	Uk luraspänwa.
I always feel that way.	Sapa kutiw ukham jikjjatasta.
And he walked quickly.	Ukat jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
Everything in the room is quiet.	Taqi kunas uka cuarto ukanx amukiw jikxatasi.
I promise I don’t drink too much.	Janiw sinti umañ munkti sasaw arsuwayta.
You have to say that.	Jumax ukham sañama.
I want someone like that.	Nayax ukham jaqiruw munta.
And it’s still very difficult.	Ukat wali wali ch’amawa.
It’s because of what it is.	Ukax kunatix utjki ukatwa.
I hope that was of some use.	Ukajj mä jukʼa askïkaspas ukhamwa suytʼaskta.
I don’t want to, of course.	Nayax janiw munkti, chiqpachansa.
I don’t want to go there.	Janiw nayax uka chiqar sarañ munkti.
Now he knew that was not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkänti uk sum yatïna.
No one knows about it.	Janiw khitis yatkti.
That’s what I needed.	Ukaw munasïna.
But that is not unusual.	Ukampis ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
That was really nice.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
About ten, maybe.	Niya tunka, inas.
And he’s the first one.	Ukat jupax nayrïr jaqiwa.
Of course he wanted to know about it.	Chiqansa jupax uka tuqit yatxatañ munäna.
But it wasn't, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
A lot of things can happen.	Walja kunaw pasaspa.
In a way he is.	Mä tuqitxa jupax ukhamawa.
I saw him yesterday morning.	Nayax qharüru alwaw jupar uñjta.
So that’s how it started.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa qalltäna.
I don't know how to help him.	Janiw kunjamsa jupar yanaptʼañ yatkti.
He called her several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jawsäna.
I can’t stand him.	Janiw jupar aguantañjamäkiti.
I didn’t want to do anything about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munkayätti.
It's still a long one.	Wali jaya.
Or a car?.	Jan ukax auto?.
No, not tomorrow.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw qhipürux ukhamäkiti.
Let’s see how you can do it.	Kunjamsa lurasma uk uñjañäni.
It is important not to rush.	Jan jankʼak lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
If you like me.	Jumax nayar munsta ukhaxa.
I wonder if that makes sense.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼasta.
He knew he would be hungry.	Jupajj manqʼat awtjataw uñjasispa uk sum yatïna.
Day after day, week after week, year after year.	Uru uru, semana semana, mara mara.
About a week after the incident.	Niya mä semanaw uka jan waltʼäwit qheparäna.
Honestly, that’s okay.	Chiqpachansa, ukax walikïskiwa.
The eyes of the snowflakes.	Nayra ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
No, he decided.	Janiwa, sasaw amtäna.
Eventually, though, he felt better.	Ukampis qhepatjja, jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasïna sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
You don’t want one at all.	Jumax janiw kunjamatsa maynix munktati.
I’m still watching it.	Nayax wali sum uñjta.
That doesn't really mean anything.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns sañ munkiti.
I never expected to persuade him.	Janiw kunapachas jupar amuytʼayañ suykayätti.
Let’s see if you can do what he says.	Kuntï siski uk lurasmati janicha uk uñjañäni.
What is the value?.	¿Kunas ukaxa?.
And that’s exactly what was needed.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw wakisïna.
It’s an airplane.	Ukax mä avión satawa.
Really looking forward to playing it.	Chiqpachansa uka anattʼañ suytʼaskta.
They were very nice.	Wali suma ukhama.
It was a terrible time there.	Ukanjja, mä jan wali tiempow utjäna.
So what does it matter.	Ukhamajj kunas ukajj wakisi.
For a while it wasn't.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I can't imagine that.	Janiw ukham amuytʼirjamäkti.
I asked to go every year.	Nayax sapa maraw sarañatak mayïna.
But that happened a long time ago.	Ukampis ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
Finally, he got what he wanted.	Qhepatjja, kuntï munkäna uk katoqäna.
I don’t want to tell him.	Janiw jupar sañ munkti.
Not much more than that.	Janiw juk’ampi sinti ukat sipansa.
That he is right .	Ukajj jupajj cheqapuniw .
But that was not the question.	Ukampis janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkänti.
He knew more than she did.	Jupat sipansa jukʼampiw yatïna.
It’s only necessary once.	Mä kutikiw wakisi.
But I can’t do it.	Ukampis janiw lurirjamäkti.
But he did it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham luräna.
Make these important.	Ukanakax wakiskir lurañamawa.
He did that to her.	Jupaw jupar ukham luräna.
But they’re important.	Ukampis jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
I am really, really sorry.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa llakistwa.
This is exciting.	Akax kusiskañawa.
He threw them at me.	Jupajj jupanakajj nayaruw jaqontäna.
No one said anything.	Janiw khitis siskänti.
That’s another ten.	Ukax yaqha tunka.
But whatever, whatever.	Ukampis kunas, kunas.
He couldn’t get out of the car.	Jupax janiw uka autot mistuñ puedkänti.
It was my first film.	Ukajj nayrïr película ukhamänwa.
He doesn't know why.	Kunatsa ukham siski uk janiw yatkiti.
It was there for hours.	Ukanjja walja horanakaw utjäna.
Everything is very clear.	Taqi kunas wali qhanawa.
These are very rare.	Ukanakax wali juk’akiw utji.
I saw it again.	Nayax wasitat uñjta.
And no one knows about it.	Ukat janiw khitis uka toqet yatkiti.
Yesterday was the day.	Qharürux uka uruw utjäna.
He knows about it.	Jupajj uka toqet sum yati.
I didn't want that life.	Nayajj janiw uka jakañ munkayätti.
He was very, very happy with the evening.	Jupax wali, wali kusisitaw uka jayp’ux jikxatasïna.
Still him of course.	Wali jupar chiqpachansa.
Everything was available.	Taqi kunaw utjäna.
So pretty good so far.	Ukhamajj jichhakamajj wali sumawa.
I feel like that’s the case.	Nayax ukham amuyasta.
I’m so good for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali askiwa.
But you ask the question.	Ukampis jumaw jisktʼasta.
Let's look at the little things.	Jiskʼa yänak uñjañäni.
He just talked about it.	Jupajj jichhakiw uka toqet parläna.
And a nobody.	Ukat mä jan khitis.
The person is his.	Jaqix jupan.
I, of course, want to stay there.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, ukan qhiparañ munta.
Eventually, he said, but not now.	Qhepatjja, sänwa, ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Such a long time.	Ukham jaya tiempo.
That’s what it looks like.	Ukax ukham uñt’atawa.
I’ve been doing this for the past twenty years.	Nayax aka qhipa pä tunk maranakaw ukham lurañ amtawayta.
But it doesn't matter where it came from.	Ukampis kawkitsa jutäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
That’s because.	Ukax kunatix.
He is everything you could ever wish for.	Jupajj taqe kuntï jumajj munkayäta ukhama.
He spent many good years here.	Jupax akanx walja suma maranakaw jikxatasïna.
But that was not the case at the time.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, janiw ukajj utjkänti.
I think it’s that fascinating.	Nayatakix ukham wali muspharkañawa.
He actually told me to do something one day.	Chiqansa, mä urux kuns lurañamawa sasaw sitäna.
I never thought of it that way.	Janipuniw ukham amuykti.
I think this guy thought he could do anything.	Nayax amuyta, aka waynax kuns luraspawa sasaw amuyäna.
At the time, it was.	Uka tiemponjja, ukhamänwa.
Only what came next.	Kunatï qhepat jutäna ukakiw utjäna.
Lots and lots of money.	Walja ukat walja qullqi.
Someone knows better.	Maynix juk’amp sum yati.
I like anywhere.	Nayax kawkirus wali askiwa.
I really like this house.	Nayatakix aka utax wali askiwa.
He was so excited, and happy.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna, ukat kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I thought he was good.	Nayajj jupajj suma jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
He was sleeping soundly.	Jupax wali sum ikiskäna.
I would definitely do them again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jupanakar wasitat lurañ munta.
Nothing is very interesting.	Janiw kunas wali askïkiti.
I’m not like that right now.	Nayax janiw jichhax ukhamäkti.
And it still looks like that.	Ukat wali ukham uñt’atawa.
There's nothing more.	Janiw juk'ampi utjkiti.
But he did it somehow.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk luräna.
I was shocked at how popular it was.	Ukajj kunjamsa wali munasïna uk uñjasajj wal muspharta.
But there is nothing he can do.	Ukampis janiw kunas jupajj lurkaspati.
You want me to be myself.	Jumax naya pachpaw munta.
It’s better to do this.	Uka lurañax juk’amp askiwa.
He didn't know it was going to happen.	Jupajj janiw ukajj pasañap yatkänti.
Nothing about it now.	Jichhax janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
And he was a nice guy.	Ukat jupajj wali suma jaqënwa.
He’s still in love.	Jupax wali munasiñampiw sarnaqaski.
And it had nothing to do with me in the first place.	Ukat nayrïr chiqanx janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkänti.
But yes,’ she replied.	Ukampis jïsa’ sasaw jupajj säna.
I really want to play him again.	Chiqpachansa jupar wasitat anattʼañ munta.
He talked more about himself.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jupa pachpat parläna.
Lots and lots of days like that.	Walja ukat walja urunak ukham.
I started working.	Nayax irnaqañ qalltawayta.
Somehow, he didn’t understand.	Kunjamatsa, janiw amuykänti.
That was someone.	Ukajj mayniw utjäna.
But that doesn't mean you can't do anything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kun lurañjamäkiti sañ munkiti.
That's what I don't know.	Ukajj janiw yatkti.
But there are two surprising facts.	Ukampis pä muspharkañ chiqaw utji.
Two days now.	Jichhax pä uru.
I can't imagine what he's going to make of it.	Kunsa jupajj ukat lurani uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
That’s what happened.	Ukax kunas pasäna.
Of course, he still can.	Chiqansa, jupax wali luraspawa.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He was very shaken up.	Jupajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He was shaken up as well.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
That doesn't mean everything is fine.	Ukajj janiw taqe kunas walikïskiti sañ munkiti.
That’s exactly what it is.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
This is especially noticeable for you.	Ukajj jumatakejj jukʼampiw uñjasi.
He’ll get there eventually.	Jupax qhipharux ukaruw purini.
He was doing it well.	Jupajj ukanak sum luraskäna.
Please tell us again.	Uk mayamp yatiyapxita.
You are the first person.	Jumax nayrïr jaqiwa.
It’s kind of weird.	Mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
And you know he has no problem.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa jupax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
This will take some time.	Ukatakejj mä qhawqha tiempow munasini.
And they .	Ukat jupanakax .
And after that.	Ukat uka qhepatjja.
I had to do it.	Nayajj lurañaw wakisïna.
This wasn’t the case.	Akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
So he stayed behind.	Ukatwa jupajj qheparäna.
Smaller actually more.	Jisk’a chiqpachansa juk’ampi.
He didn't know why it happened.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
It looks cooler.	Ukax juk’amp thaya uñtatawa.
I expected nothing more.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp suykayätti.
Whatever you want to do.	Kuntï jumajj lurañ munkta ukjja.
And you can’t do that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He wasn't sure what he was saying.	Jupajj janiw kuntï siskäna uk sum yatkänti.
It will do everything it can.	Taqi kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurani.
And this time it was even better.	Ukat aka kutin jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
I know it was pretty good.	Nayax yattwa wali sumapunïnwa.
You’ll feel better.	Jumax wali sum jikxatasïta.
I can’t find it anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans jikxatkti.
It just so happens to be what happens.	Ukax ukhamakiw pasäna kunatix luraski.
I would have done the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw luraspäna.
But no one could do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurkaspänti.
He was a happy man.	Jupajj kusisit jaqënwa.
But he didn't want to give up.	Ukampis janiw jaytañ munkänti.
I wanted to do something a little wrong.	Mä jukʼa jan walinak lurañwa munta.
But that doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskiti.
I really want to see him.	Jupar uñjañ walpun munta.
There was something wrong with me.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis nayamp utjäna.
I want to get back in again.	Nayax wasitat mantañ munta.
I didn’t want to, but there was no choice.	Janiw munkayätti, ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I did the same thing as well.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw ukham lurayäta.
Now, it’s time to do it.	Jichhax, uk lurañ pachaw purini.
He had no idea what was going on.	Jupajj janiw kunas paskäna uk amuykänti.
There is room for improvement.	Ukanjja, jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
It’s not my best interest.	Janiw nayan askïkiti.
No one knows who did it or why.	Khitis uk luräna ni kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Something I liked a lot.	Kunas wal gustitu.
He wanted to do everything but with her.	Jupajj taqe kun lurañwa munäna, ukampis jupamp chikaw lurañ munäna.
I can’t stand them.	Janiw jupanakar aguantañjamäkiti.
I decided to buy it.	Uka alañ amtawayta.
He’s the one who makes the snow.	Jupaw uka ch’uqi lurañapa.
I came, I came, I came.	Naya, naya, naya.
That’s how long it lasts.	Ukhamaw qawqha pachas utji.
He knew they were all at once.	Jupanakajj mä kutikiw utjäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He did what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luräna.
But I doubt I can do that.	Ukampis uk lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa pächasta.
I’m not saying, this doesn’t work.	Nayax janiw sañ munkti, akax janiw irnaqkiti.
Now this is funny.	Jichhax akax wali muspharkañawa.
This is the best thing I’ve ever done.	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It can’t be long now.	Jichhax janiw jaya pachax utjkaspati.
Haven’t gone to bed yet.	Janiw jichhakamax ikiñar sarkiti.
He did it for real, so he did it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk luräna, ukatwa uk luräna.
You know he will do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurani uk yatisktawa.
Individually it doesn’t matter.	Sapa mayniw janiw kunäkisa.
I don’t know how to access them.	Janiw kunjams jupanakar mantañ yatkti.
He had no way of knowing what was going on inside.	Uka manqhan kunas paskäna uk janiw kunjamatsa yatkänti.
He didn't understand why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykänti.
But that took a long time.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
Large and spacious.	Jach’a ukat jach’a.
Let's see how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi uk uñjañäni.
We will do better.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp sumwa lurañäni.
It wasn’t in the house.	Janiw uka uta manqhan utjkänti.
I really don't have time this year.	Chiqansa, aka marax janiw tiemponïkti.
He was right about it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanakat cheq parläna.
I think it’s really exciting.	Nayax chiqpachans wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyta.
The way we can do it is beautiful.	Kunjamtï jiwasajj lurañjamäki ukajj wali sumawa.
He went straight to work.	Jupax chiqaw irnaqäwir saräna.
I want to know what it is about.	Nayax kunas uka tuqit yatxatañ munta.
I liked it a lot, which surprised me.	Ukajj walpun gustitu, ukajj walpun muspharta.
And nobody did it.	Ukat janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
Now I know how to get there.	Jichhajj kunjamsa uka cheqar puriñ yatta.
That’s a good how you can do it.	Ukax mä suma kunjams lurasma.
But, it’s not that good in the real world.	Ukampis, janiw chiqpach pachanx ukham askïkiti.
He didn’t really know why he was coming here tonight.	Jupax janiw chiqpachapunix kunatsa jichha arumax akan jutani ukx yatkänti.
After that, he walked constantly.	Uka qhepatjja, sapa kutiw sarnaqäna.
That’s all there will be.	Ukakiw utjani.
How long ago it feels.	Qhawqha pachas nayrax ukham amuyasi.
I’ve done one.	Nayax mä lurawayta.
And tell me that.	Ukat ukham yatiyapxita.
But no one likes him.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupar munaskiti.
I really didn’t really want to.	Chiqpachansa janiw chiqpachapuni munkayätti.
This is by no means the case.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
It’s really a stranger.	Chiqpachansa mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
No one knew what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
But it didn't have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
He didn’t have any reason.	Janiw kuna razonas jupan utjkänti.
They are very obvious.	Jupanakax wali qhanaw uñjasi.
And they know very well the fact.	Ukat jupanakax wali sum yatipxi uka chiqa.
Today, it doesn't matter.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw kunäkisa.
He wasn't there.	Jupajj janiw uka cheqan utjkänti.
Surprisingly, very surprising indeed.	Muspharkañawa, wali muspharkañawa chiqpachansa.
It doesn’t work very well.	Janiw sinti irnaqkiti.
He wanted it badly enough.	Jupajj jan walpun munäna.
After a long time, it felt good.	Walja tiempo qhepatjja, wali sumaw jikjjatasïna.
I knew nothing about him at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw jupat kuns yatkayätti.
We’ll see him inside, obviously.	Jiwasax juparux manqhan uñjañäni, qhanawa.
She was so happy to see him again.	Jupar wasitat uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
There was one thing he had not told her.	Mä kunaw utjäna, jupajj janiw jupar siskänti.
He lived his life like that.	Jupajj ukham jakasïna.
He doesn't want her right now, not that much.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj jupar munkiti, janiw ukham munkiti.
Which is exactly what he did.	Ukajj cheqapuniw jupajj luräna.
We went to the right.	Ukaruw sarapjjta.
I don't understand why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykti.
Don't act on how you feel.	Janiw kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk lurañamäkiti.
He needs some time.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow munasi.
Of course I did, he thought.	Chiqpachansa nayax uk lurawayta, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Probably as he says.	Inas kunjamtï jupax siski ukhama.
I’ve seen you do it yourself.	Nayax juma pachpaw ukanak lurañ uñjta.
I think you already know.	Nayax amuyta jumax yatisktawa.
I can’t believe he did that.	Ukham luratapat janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It’s hard to chop.	Ukax ch’amaw ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But it only needs to be done once.	Ukampis mä kutikiw ukham lurañapa.
Of course that means both.	Chiqansa ukax panpachaniw sañ muni.
He didn't quite know that.	Jupajj janiw uk sum yatkänti.
He has to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañapawa.
I mean it was for me.	Nayatakix ukhamänwa sañ munta.
Of course, he never did.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
So let’s see.	Ukhamajj uñjañäni.
That’s nothing about it.	Ukax janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
He didn’t say why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa siskänti.
He focused on me.	Jupajj nayaruw chuym churäna.
What are the hours of purini? 	¿Kuna horasas purini?
And he saw more.	Ukat jukʼamp uñjäna.
That’s what I know about me.	Ukax nayat uñt’atawa.
That guy is good for me.	Uka waynax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I know immediately what he is saying.	Kuntï siski uk jankʼakiw yatta.
No one said it.	Janiw khitis uk arskänti.
He certainly did.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
You can do that one day.	Mä urux ukham lurasma.
I really liked it.	Chiqpachansa wali sum uñjta.
That's what he was saying.	Ukaw jupajj siskäna.
I understand what happened there.	Kunatï ukan paskäna uk sum amuyta.
Same day doesn’t matter.	Pachpa urux janiw kunäkisa.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jukʼamp luraspa uk yatkänti.
I am currently looking for a job.	Jichhax mä irnaqäw thaqhaskta.
Instead, he began to do bad things.	Jan ukasti, jan walinak lurañwa qalltäna.
I decided to leave anyway.	Nayax kunjamatsa sarxañ amtawayta.
It just happened all the time.	Ukajj sapa kutikiw pasäna.
He still didn't understand.	Jupajj wali sumwa jan amuyaskänti.
But he knew there was nothing more he could do.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkaspati uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I don’t want to see it.	Janiw nayax uñjañ munkti.
What did he mean by that.	¿Kunsa jupajj sañ munäna.
I don’t like it very much.	Nayax janiw sinti gustkituti.
I’m able to talk.	Nayax parlañ yatta.
He spoke very clearly.	Jupajj wali qhanaw parläna.
So tell us a bit about yourself.	Ukhamajj jumat mä jukʼa yatiyapjjeta.
Like anything meant.	Kunjamtï kunas sañ munkäna ukhama.
No one could have done it better.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp sum lurkaspänti.
There wasn't much time left.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
He was surprised that he was actually asleep.	Chiqpachansa ikiskäna ukax wal muspharäna.
Bigger than you are.	Jumat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
It saw better days.	Ukajj jukʼamp suma urunak uñjäna.
But there’s a part of me that always says.	Ukampis nayan mä chiqaw utji, ukax sapa kutiw siski.
It was very quiet here.	Aka chiqanx wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
I’m barely here.	Nayax juk’akiw akanktxa.
Everyone knows how to use them.	Taqinipuniw ukanak apnaqañ yatipxi.
I can have everything.	Nayajj taqe kunaw utjaspa.
But that night he did something wrong.	Ukampis uka arumax jan walinak luräna.
But somehow.	Ukampis kunjamatsa.
Please tell me.	Nayar yatiyapjjeta.
I think it’s you.	Nayax jumaw sasaw amuyta.
That’s why something is happening.	Ukatwa kunas pasaski.
The price is well worth it.	Uka qullqix wali askiwa.
And maybe you should do something nice about it.	Ukat inas uka tuqitxa mä suma lurañax wakischispa.
And water, too.	Ukat uma, ukhamaraki.
Or two weeks passed.	Jan ukajj pä semanaw pasäna.
I have no idea how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
Well there it is.	Sumaw ukanx utji.
I loved the film.	Nayax uka película ukarux walpun munasta.
And that's pretty amazing.	Ukat ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
I asked him how much he wanted.	Qhawqha qollqsa munta sasaw jisktʼta.
But he wasn't like that .	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukhamäkänti .
He didn't know how or when.	Kunjamsa, kunapachas uk janiw yatkänti.
There is nothing you can do at this time.	Aka pachanx janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But it takes some time.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
That doesn't work for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
He didn’t want to move.	Jupax janiw yaqha chiqar sarxañ munkänti.
This is not considered necessary.	Ukax janiw wakiskiti sasaw amuyasi.
I’m doing a lot of things.	Nayax walja lurañanak luraskta.
When that happens, that's what happens.	Kunapachatï ukham luraski ukhajja, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
He was such a genuine person.	Jupajj ukham cheqpach jaqënwa.
Or last night.	Jan ukax qharüru arumax.
It went quickly.	Ukax jank’akiw saräna.
That's beautiful,' he said.	Ukajj wali sumawa’ sasaw jupajj säna.
Someone said that.	Maynix ukham sasaw säna.
I know what you mean.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk nayajj yattwa.
But that is never a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj janipuniw walïkiti.
It is not in our interest to do so.	Uk lurañajj janiw jiwasatak askïkiti.
You can’t do everything by yourself.	Janiw juma sapakix taqi kun lurañjamäkiti.
but I cannot do this well.	ukampis janiw uk sum lurañjamäkiti.
But not everyone knows how.	Ukampis janiw taqenis kunjamsa uk yatipkiti.
But I didn’t get anything.	Ukampis nayax janiw kuns jikxatkti.
Everything is amazing to me.	Taqe kunas nayatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
I don't know how you do that.	Kunjamsa ukham lurasma uk janiw yatkti.
He asked her where she was from.	Jupajj kawkitsa uk jisktʼäna.
Anyway, that’s it now.	Kawkhansa, ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
Let’s see what happens.	Kunas uk uñjañäni.
He doesn’t, as you say.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhama.
You don’t want to talk.	Jumax janiw parlañ munktati.
You know what needs to be done.	Kuna lurañas wakisi uk jumax yatisktawa.
You have to do it with love.	Jumax munasiñampiw uk lurañama.
I know a lot about you guys.	Nayax jumanakat walpun yatta.
At the time, no one knew who he was.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw khitis khitïnsa uk yatkänti.
But he refused to tell.	Ukampis janiw yatiyañ munkänti.
I didn't know that.	Janiw nayajj ukham yatkayätti.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis aka tuqitxa utjkiti.
He says he doesn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw saraki.
You don’t want a man.	Jumax janiw mä chachar munktati.
It was a very nice experience.	Wali sumapunïnwa.
And then it’s a little better there.	Ukat ukat mä juk’a juk’amp sumaw ukanx utji.
You weren’t like that.	Jumax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I want to say nothing.	Nayax jan kuns arsuñ munta.
That’s how that happened.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax utjäna.
I’m not really like that .	Nayax janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkti .
He is more important than you think.	Jupax jumax amuyta ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
There wasn’t.	Janiw utjkänti.
I can’t say for sure.	Janiw chiqpachapunix siskti.
And beyond that, it’s not necessary.	Ukat ukat sipansa, janiw wakiskiti.
Good and very nice.	Suma ukat wali suma.
Get the chance!.	¡Uka ch’amampiw jikxatasi!.
That’s what it meant.	Ukax sañ munäna.
I really hope so.	Chiqpachansa ukham suytʼaskta.
I didn’t go to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjir sarkti.
He was a completely new person.	Jupajj mä qʼala machaq jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He just gave me a great gift.	Jichhakiw mä jachʼa regalo churitu.
As one does.	Kunjamtï maynix luraski ukhama.
See you next time.	Jutïr kutin uñjañäni.
I don’t want to say that.	Janiw uk sañ munkti.
I’ve done this.	Nayax aka lurawayta.
I don't need to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I don’t have the money, I don’t have the money, I never got it.	Janiw qullqix utjkituti, qullqi qullqix utjkituti, janipuniw jikxatkti.
He was a very good student.	Jupajj wali sumwa yateqäna.
No one can do it for you.	Janiw khitis jumatakix uk lurkaspati.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Janiw jumamp parlañ munkti.
It means the same thing.	Ukajj pachpa sañ muni.
That’s what happened to him.	Ukhamaw jupar pasäna.
Or so they told me.	Jan ukajj ukham sapjjetäna.
There will be an opportunity to attend a wedding reception.	Ukanjja, mä casarasiñatak mä fiestar sarañatakiw mä oportunidad utjani.
If something happens.	Kunas pasaspa ukhaxa.

What's the matter.	¿Kunas uka tuqitxa.
You can find it here.	Aka chiqan jikxatasi.
But somehow he couldn't talk.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw parlañ puedkänti.
Let’s see how long it lasts.	Qhawqha tiempos uk uñjañäni.
That was twenty years ago.	Ukajj pä tunka mara nayraw pasäna.
No, he couldn't.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw puedkänti.
I don’t remember much of anything.	Janiw kunatsa wal amtaskti.

He’s going to love it.	Jupax wali munasiñampiw saraski.
But I don't think that's right.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukajj walïkiti.
This sounds really good to you.	Akax jumatakix chiqpachans wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
I don’t see the man.	Nayax janiw uka jaqir uñjkti.
He could not speak again.	Jupajj janiw mayamp parlañ puedkänti.

He didn’t want to talk about it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit arsuñ munkänti.

Better than nothing at all.	Jan kuna lurañat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Nothing like it, ever again.	Janiw kunas ukham utjkiti, janipuniw mayampsa.

It’s been around for a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw utjawayi.
You 're not.	Jumax 'janiw.
I have loved him for many years.	Walja maranakaw jupar munasta.
He was terrified of it.	Jupajj wal ajjsaräna.
I’m so sorry how hard it was.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa kunjams ch’amaw jikxatasïna.
I can’t find them anywhere.	Nayax janiw jupanakar kawkhans jikxatkti.
Or, at least it was.	Jan ukajj, mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamänwa.
But somehow,.	Ukampis kunjamatsa,...
The time is coming soon.	Uka tiempojj niyaw purini.
He wants to talk.	Jupax parlañ muni.

Once is not necessary.	Mä kutix janiw wakiskiti.
And there really wasn’t much.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw sinti utjkänti.
Later, he spoke more quietly.	Qhepatjja, jukʼamp amukiw arsüna.
I’ve never been like that.	Janipuniw ukhamäkti.
It was the first time he was honest with anyone.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw khitirus cheq parläna.
They are able to do more.	Jupanakax juk’amp lurañ yatipxi.
That's what's coming.	Ukaw jutani.
That’s definitely something that needs to be done.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw mä kunaw lurañapa.
I want to be the new me.	Nayax machaq nayar tukuñ munta.

I think the price is about right.	Nayax uka qullqix niya chiqaw sasaw amuyta.
I decided to get there if I had to.	Nayax uka chiqar puriñ amtawayta, ukax wakisispa ukhaxa.

Therefore, he felt very comfortable.	Ukatwa wali sum jikjjatasïna.
You’re right about him.	Jumaw jupar cheq sista.

He saw them as equals.	Jupajj mä pachpa jaqëkaspas ukhamwa uñjäna.
In this respect, he is partially right.	Aka tuqitxa, jupax mä chikat chiqaw sañ muni.
This is a completely new character.	Akax mä taqpach machaq jaqiwa.
As if he could do that.	Ukham luraspa ukhama.
You were so beautiful.	Jumax wali sumapunïnwa.
It doesn’t mean anything, really.	Janiw kuns sañ munkiti, chiqpachansa.
Yes, he meant it.	Jïsa, uk sañ munäna.
It’s faster and less expensive to do.	Ukax juk’amp jank’akiw ukat lurañax janiw sinti qullqis munaskiti.
In one sense he is a foreigner.	Mä tuqitxa yaqha markankir jaqiwa.
Whatever happens, it doesn’t.	Kunas pasaspa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I promised it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk arsuwayta.
From a distance.	Mä jaya chiqat.
I know exactly what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk sum yatta.
He did what she told him to do.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk luräna.
I knew it wasn't.	Janiw ukhamäkänti uk sum yatiyäta.
I want to tell you about it as soon as possible.	Uka tuqitx jank’akiw yatiyañ munta.
If you ever want to join, let me know.	Jumatix kunapachas ukar mantañ munsta ukhax yatiyapxita.
I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti.
Very carefully, he thought.	Wali amuyumpiw sasaw amuyäna.
This is when .	Ukajj kunapachatï .
That's what he didn't realize.	Ukaw jupajj jan amuyaskänti.
I want to move from there.	Nayax ukat yaqha chiqar sarxañ munta.
I want a blood draw.	Mä wila apsuñ munta.
Tell us how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk yatiyapjjeta.
But he didn't really want to know.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun yatiñ munkänti.
Or he's the one.	Jan ukajj jupajj.
No, he is not like that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s faster now.	Jichhax juk’amp jank’akiw.
There are rights and wrongs.	Kunatï walïki ukat jan walïki ukanakaw utji.
He never had anything like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham kunas utjkänti.

And knows a thing or two.	Ukat mä jan ukax pä kunsa yati.
But it doesn't work for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
Don't be afraid.	Janiwa janiwa.
Nobody wants that.	Janiw khitis ukanak munkiti.
Now I have found him.	Jichhajj jupar jikjjatasta.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
It was a wonderful experience .	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa .
And then it happened.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He’s not the only one.	Janiw jupa sapakix ukham lurkiti.
That was the case today.	Jichhürojj ukhamänwa.
The box isn’t.	Ukaxa janiwa.
I didn’t think I could do that.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykayätti.
It took a couple of hours.	Ukatakejj mä pä horaw munasïna.
I’ve done this quite a few times, actually.	Nayax wali walja kutiw ukham lurawayta, chiqpachansa.
Do this several times.	Walja kutiw uka lurañanak lurañama.
There was nothing beyond that.	Ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkänti.
I want him here now.	Nayax juparux jichhax aka chiqan munta.
He spoke quietly.	Jupajj amukiw parläna.
Let’s do the job now.	Jichhax uka irnaqäw lurañäni.
I don't know why or how it happened.	Kunatsa jan ukajj kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
I’ve seen the man.	Nayax uka jaqiruw uñjta.
He wanted something small.	Jupajj mä jiskʼa kunwa munäna.
Of course, it doesn't matter.	Chiqansa, janiw ukax kunäkisa.
I heard him say that.	Ukham sasin istʼta.
He’s been there for a long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasïna.
And so he will.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj lurani.
The same is true today.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukhamarakiw pasaski.
But something told him not to.	Ukampis kunas jan ukham luramti sasaw säna.
He knew what was happening to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna uk sum yatïna.
Left-handed snowflake.	Ch’iqa ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He decided that was enough.	Ukaw wakisi sasaw amtäna.
He wanted something more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw kunsa munäna.
We’re going to do that.	Jiwasax ukham lurañäni.
It’s not bad in any way.	Janiw kuna tuqitsa jan walïkiti.
But it’s not, it’s not.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He knew that kind of well.	Jupajj uka kasta sum yatïna.
That’s what he is now.	Ukax jupax jichhax ukhamawa.
Do you know what it is.	¿Kunsa uk yattati.
I love how it turned out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk walpun munasta.
He says he doesn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw saraki.
He knew what was wrong.	Jupajj kunas jan walïki uk sum yatïna.
Or not really at all.	Jan ukax janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.

He has done this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham lurawayi.
I knew that well.	Uk sum yatiyäta.
And he did it very well.	Ukat wali sumwa uk luräna.
He’s just like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw ukhama.
But it had only happened once before.	Ukampis nayrajj mä kutikiw ukham pasäna.
That was something that happened.	Ukajj mä kunaw pasäna.
This happened three days ago.	Ukax kimsa uru nayraw pasäna.
I love the beer.	Nayax cerveza ukarux walpun munasta.
There was no time.	Janiwa tiempojj utjkänti.
And there’s no reason to do that.	Ukat janiw kuna razonas ukham lurañax utjkiti.
But I don't know that for sure.	Ukampis janiw ukajj sum yatkti.
But he wasn’t, of course.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqpachansa.
I decided it wasn’t good enough for me.	Janiw nayatakix askïkiti sasaw amtawayta.
I just want one.	Nayax mä sapakiw munta.
It didn't exist.	Janiw ukajj utjkänti.
He started doing something.	Kun lurañ qalltäna.
He wasn't sure what had caused it.	Kunas ukham luratayna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
But you better have something that good.	Ukampis jumajj jukʼamp askiwa kunatï ukham suma utjki ukajja.
I don’t really know why.	Janiw chiqpachansa kunatsa uk yatkti.
That was the only issue.	Ukakiw uka tuqitxa amuyasïna.
I think it was really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa sasaw amuyta.
What can you do there.	¿Kunsa ukan lurasma.
In fact, he was very happy.	Chiqansa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I have nothing to do with you.	Nayajj janiw jumatak kuns lurkti.
It went well, he thought.	Wali sumaw saräna, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
A couple of times, maybe.	Mä pä kuti, inas.
It is better than done.	Ukajj lurañat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
I think these are very important.	Ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
But he’s still a good guy.	Ukampis jupax wali suma waynawa.

You have three days to get there.	Ukar puriñkamax kimsa uruw utji.
Nothing more to do here.	Janiw kunas juk’amp lurañax akan utjkiti.

He’s a terrible guy.	Jupax wali axsarkañ jaqiwa.
They don’t mean anything to me.	Jupanakax janiw kunas nayatakix askïkiti.
Tell us about your school.	Yatiqañ uta tuqit yatiyapxita.
He couldn't do anything now.	Jichhajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
I personally do not believe so.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham creykti.
I haven’t found one yet.	Janiw jichhakamax mä jikxatkti.

There, as he said.	Ukanjja, kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukhama.
And that’s exactly what’s happening.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw pasaski.
It’s not a good thing.	Janiw walïkiti.
This may take some time to do.	Uk lurañatakejj inas mä jukʼa tiempojj wakischispa.
So cold, so very cold.	Ukhama thaya, ukhama wali thaya.
I don’t want to take away what he said.	Janiw kuntï siskäna uk apsuñ munkti.
What do you think we should do?.	¿Kuns lurañasa sasin amuyta?.
It won’t be long now.	Jichhax janiw jaya pachax utjkaniti.
That’s what I like about him.	Ukaw jupat wal gustitu.
And you’ll have a lot of fun doing it.	Ukat ukham lurasax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
Or a car.	Jan ukajj mä auto.
That is why we exist.	Ukatwa jiwasajj utjistu.
But he understood why he wanted to leave.	Ukampis kunatsa sarxañ munäna uk sum amuyäna.
He started again.	Jupajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
He wanted to know where it could be.	Jupajj kawkhansa ukajj utjaspa uk yatiñwa munäna.
There was just something wrong with it.	Ukanjja, kunatï jan walïki ukakiw utjäna.
Fortunately so far, that’s not the case.	Jichhakamax wali askiwa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But I didn’t get it.	Ukampis janiw ukanak jikxatkti.
I think so too.	Nayax ukhamarakiw amuyta.
But let’s do it right.	Ukampis ukanak sum lurañäni.
All of these are awesome, too.	Taqi ukanakax wali muspharkañawa, ukhamaraki.
It’s going to be a great night.	Mä jach’a arumaw utjani.
No one liked going to bed.	Janiw khitirus ikiñar sarañax gustkänti.
I don't know that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham yatkti.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Nayax janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
There is a slowdown.	Ukhamaw utji.
He came up with the idea.	Jupax uka amuyumpiw jutäna.
And I didn't want to tell anyone about it.	Ukat janiw khitirus uka toqet yatiyañ munkayätti.
I have heard this many times.	Walja kutiw uk istʼta.
I think that would be interesting.	Ukajj wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
He’s going to go home.	Jupax utaparuw sarxi.
I know he will.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham lurani.
This was years in the making.	Ukajj walja maranakaw luraskäna.
The man spoke up.	Uka jaqejj arsüna.
Last night.	Qhipa arumax.
I am going myself, and that is fine.	Naya pachpaw saraskta, ukajj walikïskiwa.
I understand what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk amuyta.
It doesn't matter how or why.	Kunjamsa jan ukajj kunatsa ukham lurañajj janiw wakiskiti.
He wants to know who that person is.	Khitis uka jaqejj uk yatiñ muni.
So much worse it looked.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp jan waliw uñnaqäna.
I’m definitely.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw.
I want to know everything about everything.	Taqi kunat taqi kun yatxatañ munta.
It was almost time.	Niyaw tiempojj purinïna.
That was not the case today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I thought this was him.	Akax jupaw sasaw amuyayäta.
I'm in trouble here.	Nayax akan jan walt'äwin jikxatastxa.
You left me alone.	Jumax nayaruw jaytawayta.
I think you know that.	Nayax amuyta jumax uk yatisktawa.
It looks like a beautiful place.	Mä suma chiqar uñtatawa.
He was a nice guy.	Jupajj mä suma jaqënwa.
Really good indeed.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa chiqpachansa.
He never asked for anything.	Janipuniw kunsa mayïna.
And besides, he doesn’t have a .	Ukat ukat sipansa, jupax janiw mä .
He decided it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk amtäna.
Which will do, of course.	Kunas lurani, chiqpachansa.
A brother.	Mä jila.
Realistically, it doesn’t matter.	Chiqpach tuqitxa, janiw ukax kunäkisa.
I want to tell them.	Nayax jupanakar yatiyañ munta.
It happened both ways.	Panpachaniw pasäna.
The best part is that anyone can do it.	Ukax wali askiwa, khitis uk luraspawa.
But he wanted something.	Ukampis jupajj kunsa munäna.
But I haven’t done that recently.	Ukampis jichhakiw janiw ukham lurkti.
I don’t mean that.	Janiw nayax uk sañ munkti.
I don’t want to know.	Janiw nayax yatiñ munkti.
I’m waiting for two more.	Nayax juk’amp pä suyt’askta.
He’s really simply unavailable.	Jupax chiqpachansa jank’akiw jan utjkiti.
But what happened last week is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kunatï pasïr semanan paskäna ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
She didn't have him.	Jupajj janiw jupajj utjkänti.
So good, so good.	Ukhama suma, ukhama suma.
This is often the case.	Ukhamaw walja kutix uñjasi.
Therefore, the man died.	Ukatwa uka jaqejj jiwjjäna.
I don’t really know.	Janiw cheqpachapun yatkti.
As it happens.	Kunjamtï luraski ukhama.
He was alone now.	Jupajj jichhajj sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
A little cold though.	Mä juk’a thaya ukampis.
He is the best at what he does.	Jupaw kunanaktï luraski ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp sum yati.
Many times you don’t need to do anything.	Walja kutiw jan kun lurañax wakiskiti.
I don’t think you can do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
It’s definitely a little more interesting.	Chiqpachansa mä juk’a juk’ampi sumawa.
Yes, this is going to be an amazing year.	Jïsa, akax mä muspharkañ maraw utjani.
And I had a strange feeling .	Ukat mä muspharkañ chuymaw nayatak utjäna .
But this seemed impossible for several days.	Ukampis walja urunak ukham lurañajj janis lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Create something new.	Mä machaq lurañanak luram.
I am a teacher.	Nayajj yatichiriwa.
He said early in the morning.	Jupax wali alwaw säna.
He didn't know what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
You know where it is.	Jumax kawkhans uk yatisktawa.
Not the case now.	Janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Janiw aka chiqat kawkirus sarañ yatkti.

This time it was good.	Aka kutix wali askiwa.
And the people.	Ukat jaqinakax.
He left a few days later.	Jupajj mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa sarjjäna.
It could very well be longer.	Wali sumaw juk’amp jaya pachax utjaspa.
Or he was, anyway.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa, kunjamatsa.
I wasn't sure why he had to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
Last year it wasn’t.	Qhipa marax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s going to be a wonderful week!.	¡Mä suma semanaw utjani!.
I never quite knew what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janipuniw sum yatkti.
He didn’t, you know.	Jupax janiw uk lurkänti, jumax yatisktawa.
It shouldn’t be a bad thing.	Janiw jan walinak lurañapäkiti.
So it happened again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa pasäna.
And really strange, he never realized it before.	Ukat chiqpachansa muspharkañawa, jupax janipuniw nayrax uk amuyaskänti.
But he couldn’t sleep.	Ukampis janiw ikiñ puedkänti.
But he was still like that.	Ukampis jupax wali ukhamänwa.
Tell me what you know.	Kuntï yatkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
It doesn't matter who it is.	Khitis ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
It’s something he could do.	Ukax mä kunaw jupax luraspäna.
I can't stand anything happening to you.	Nayajj janiw kunas jumar pasañap aguantañjamäkiti.
But he really wants to do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañwa walpun munta.
That’s really cool.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali suma.
But they’re pretty obvious.	Ukampis jupanakax wali qhanawa.
He found himself, once.	Jupa pachpaw jikxatasïna, mä kutix.
These are nowhere to be found.	Ukanakax janiw kawkhans utjkiti.
Well, he didn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.
I’d like to know more.	Nayax juk’amp yatxatañ munta.
I saw and understood that time.	Uka tiempon uñjta ukat amuyta.
But you can't do these things all the time.	Ukampis janiw ukanak sapa kuti lurañjamäkiti.
It’s a difficult, but necessary one for me.	Nayatakix mä ch’amawa, ukampis wakiskiriwa.
He was partly right.	Jupajj mä cheqan cheq parläna.
He doesn't want that life.	Jupajj janiw uka jakañ munkiti.
Two two two two.	Pä pä pä pä.
That was his biggest fear.	Ukaw jupajj jukʼamp ajjsaräna.
I know he wasn’t.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
They’re too big, or too big.	Jupanakax wali jach’a, jan ukax wali jach’a.
It’s also harder for you.	Ukhamaraki, jumatakix juk’amp ch’amawa.
But it never works.	Ukampis janipuniw irnaqkiti.
Of course, he said yes.	Chiqansa, jupax jïsa sasaw säna.
That means you have to do it yourself.	Ukajj juma pachpaw uk lurañama sañ muni.
I don’t know anything at this point.	Nayax janiw kuns aka pachanx yatkti.
I would be very grateful if you could.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja, walpun yuspärta.

And you can do it for hours.	Ukat walja horanakaw uk lurasma.

He saw that she did not understand.	Jupajj janiw amuyaskänti uk uñjäna.
I think that’s a good thing.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali askiwa.
But he didn't know anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns yatkänti.
I don’t think he is.	Nayax janiw jupax ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
He was a little disappointed because he hadn’t done this before.	Jupax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatasïna kunatix janiw nayrax ukham lurkänti.
No one likes you here.	Janiw khitis jumarux akan munaskiti.
He is currently in his first year.	Jichhax nayrïr maraw jikxatasi.
But, that doesn’t mean anything.	Ukampis, ukax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
But he doesn’t want to stay.	Ukampis janiw qheparañ munkiti.
I really feel that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyasta.
This was a one-time event.	Ukajj mä kutikiw pasäna.
He already knew it all.	Jupajj niyaw taqe ukanak yatïna.
It is somewhat important.	Mä jukʼa wakiskiriwa.
And so he was.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
I don't have that.	Nayajj janiw ukham utjkiti.

That was about two weeks ago.	Ukajj niya pä semana nayraw pasäna.
That’s because it didn’t exist.	Ukax kunatix janiw utjkänti.
Always have, and always will.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurawayta, ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
He is a better man.	Jupajj jukʼamp suma jaqewa.

This will take about an hour.	Ukatakejj niya mä horaw munasini.
Yes, that's a good thing.	Jïsa, ukajj walikïskiwa.
That happened after that.	Ukajj uka qhepatwa pasäna.
I’ve done it a little bit.	Nayax mä juk’a lurawayta.
There was something every day.	Sapa uruw kunas utjäna.
I feed them every two weeks.	Nayax sapa pä semanaw manq’a churta.

Do this at least once every day.	Sapa uru mä kutis ukham lurañamawa.
But I never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkti.
He said he sees a lot of you.	Jupajj jumanakat wal uñjta sasaw säna.
He felt that there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati sasaw amuyasïna.
I don't want more than I need.	Janiw kunatï wakiski ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkti.
Do you have a.	¿Jumaxa uka.
It was really exciting.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

Everything is one.	Taqi kunas mä.
It looks like that.	Ukhamaw uñtasi.
Should be done next week.	Jutïr semanan lurañaw wakisi.
He gave me one.	Jupaw mä churäna.
A few hours at a time.	Mä qawqha horanak sapa kuti.
So do everything you can, no matter what.	Ukhamajj taqe kunsa lurañamawa, kunas pasaspa.
He went with her.	Jupampiw sarjjäna.
I feel better about it now.	Jichhajj uka toqet sum jikjjatasta.

So I wasn't expecting it so soon.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham jankʼak suykayätti.
The problem was not there.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw utjkänti.
And new outdoor walking room.	Ukat machaq anqan sarnaqañ uta.

Or rather, isn't it? 	Jan ukasti, ¿janich ukhamäki?
He gave it to them.	Jupaw jupanakar uk churäna.
You are not right.	Jumax janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
But someone has to do it.	Ukampis mayniw uk lurañapa.
No one was anywhere.	Janiw khitis kawkhans utjkänti.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
You should, of course.	Jumax ukhamarakiw lurañama, chiqansa.
He knew who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk sum yatïna.
I feel comfortable in that area now.	Jichhax uka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
He was a very nice guy. 	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa. 
In fact, you may want to stay home.	Chiqansa, inas utan qhiparañ munsta.
He knows it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk yati.
But you know, it’s never enough.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, janipuniw ukax wakiskiti.
But beyond that, he didn't know what to do.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
And indeed, it was.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.
He wants to walk a lot.	Jupax wal sarnaqañ muni.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali askiwa.
That is what he decided to do.	Ukaw jupajj amtäna.
I’ve seen him there.	Nayax juparux ukan uñjta.
Maybe that’s when you need something else.	Inas uka pachax yaqha tuqit wakischispa.
It feels really bad.	Chiqpachansa jan waliw jikxatasi.
They don’t know who will do it.	Khitis lurani uk janiw yatipkiti.
He didn't say anything for a long time.	Walja tiempow jan kuns arskänti.
No, not really, he said.	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa, sasaw säna.
Something had to be done.	Kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
He’s pretty good right now.	Jupax jichhax wali sumawa.

He’s having a party.	Jupax mä fiesta luraski.

The man has a long history of criminal activity.	Uka jaqix nayratpachaw jan walinak lurañ tuqit jan walinak lurawayi.
I wonder what else he knows.	¿Kunsa jukʼamp yati sasaw jisktʼasta.

A little later on.	Mä jukʼa qhepatjja.
He was kind of excited.	Jupax mä juk’a kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
No one knows everything about me.	Janiw khitis nayat taqe kun yatkiti.
I’m just like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw.
He doesn't do everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kunsa lurkiti.
He understood it well.	Jupajj sum amuyäna.
He is a tall man.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqewa.
He thought that was the right thing to do.	Jupajj ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyäna.
About what happened to you.	Kunatï jumamp paskäna uka toqetwa.
Or part of me.	Jan ukax nayat mä chiqa.
After all and no reason.	Taqi kunat sipansa ukat janiw kunatsa.

That’s a piano.	Ukax mä piano satawa.
But that is definitely wrong.	Ukampis ukajj cheqapuniw jan walïkiti.
And he’s amazing.	Ukat jupax muspharkañawa.
Of course, you want to stay here.	Chiqansa, jumax akan qhiparañ munasma.
This room, this big, he can’t do.	Aka cuarto, aka jach’a, jupax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
This is especially evident in the meat.	Ukax aycha tuqitx juk’amp qhanaw uñjasi.
I didn’t want to do that.	Janiw ukanak lurañ munkayätti.
It feels great to me.	Nayatakix wali jach’a jikxatasi.
How he ended up.	Kunjamsa jupax tukuyäna.
He decided to live alone.	Jupajj sapakiw jakañ amtäna.
So little .	Ukhama jiskʼa .
He feels very cold.	Jupax wali thaya jikxatasi.
I just see it that way.	Nayax ukhamakiw uñjta.
And he fell in love with me.	Ukat jupajj nayamp wal munasïna.
In this case, however.	Uka tuqitxa, ukampis.
It’s been good so far.	Jichhakamax wali sumawa.
I want to do something about it.	Nayax uka tuqit kuns lurañ munta.
That was all he told me.	Ukakiw jupajj sapjjetäna.
I didn’t want that at all.	Nayax janiw uk kuns munkayätti.
But he can do something about it.	Ukampis jupajj uka toqet kunsa luraspawa.
He thinks he knows everything.	Jupajj taqe kunsa yatkaspa ukhamwa amuyi.
What have I done.	Kunsa nayax lurawayta.
But I think that's fine.	Ukampis nayatakejj ukajj walikïskiwa.
He’s got to do it.	Jupaw lurañapa.
Because he’s a good guy.	Kunatix jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

What’s going to happen?.	¿Kunas pasani?.
He walked home.	Jupajj utar kayuk sarjjäna.
But no one knows for sure.	Ukampis janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
I didn't do that today.	Jichhürojj janiw uk lurkti.
He is nothing in himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kunäkisa.
There was no reason to support them.	Jupanakar yanaptʼañatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
Let me know what works best for you.	Kunas jumatakix askïspa uk yatiyapxita.
I know what is coming next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk sum yatta.

But not tonight, no, not tonight.	Ukampis janiw jichha arumax, janiwa, janiw jichha arumax ukhamäkiti.
What he wanted would not be there.	Kuntï munkäna ukajj janiw utjkaspati.
This should be done once every year.	Ukax sapa maraw mä kuti lurañapa.
But, for some reason it doesn't work.	Ukampis, kunatsa janiw irnaqkiti.
You don’t have to do that .	Janiw ukham lurañamäkiti .
Do what you need better.	Kunatï wakiski uk jukʼamp sum luram.

He took it out on it.	Jupaw uka toqet apsüna.
I let it go, I let it go, I watched it happen.	Nayax ukaruw jaytawayta, ukaruw jaytawayta, ukax pasaski uk uñjta.
He was doing something.	Jupajj kuns luraskäna.
But that's a lot of fun.	Ukampis ukajj wali kusiskañawa.
That's when I felt very comfortable.	Ukhaw wali sum jikjjatasïna.
You have to do the work yourself.	Juma pachpaw uka lurañanak lurañama.
After the first time, I did nothing.	Nayrïr kuti qhepatjja, janiw kuns lurkti.
Now it’s time for you to mix.	Jichhax jumanakan mistuñ pachaw purini.

Something serious was happening.	Kunas wali jachʼa lurañaw utjäna.
No, and afterwards.	Janiwa, ukat qhepatjja.
But he refused to do so.	Ukampis jupajj janiw munkänti.
He walked away again.	Jupajj wasitatwa sarjjäna.
Here’s what you can do .	Akax kuntix lurañjamäki ukawa .
I really want to get out.	Chiqpachansa mistuñ munta.
Whatever you want.	Kuntï munkta ukajja.

He’s like that now.	Jupax jichhax ukhamawa.
Hot, hot and hot again.	Junt’u, junt’u ukat wasitat junt’u.
It seemed almost impossible.	Ukajj niya jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I didn’t want to go there.	Janiw uka cheqar sarañ munkayätti.
I think he really loves it here.	Nayax amuyta jupax chiqpachapuniw akan wal munasi.
He decided to give it away.	Jupajj ukanak churañ amtäna.
I don't know what to do.	Nayax janiw uñt'kti.
He said, I want to get hot water.	Jupax akham sänwa, nayax junt’u uma apsuñ munta.
It didn't do that.	Ukajj janiw uk lurkänti.
Once or twice.	Mä kuti jan ukax pä kuti.
He gave him three coins.	Jupajj kimsa qollqe churäna.
They’re like that.	Jupanakax ukhama.
He didn’t say how much it would cost.	Jupax janiw qawqha qullqis utjani ukx siskänti.
He did really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa luräna.
But I don't think that matters.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
But he needs to do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Stone.	Qala.
He was very careful.	Jupax wali sum uñjäna.
So I tried hard not to do that.	Ukatwa jan ukham lurañatakejj wal chʼamachasiyäta.
No, he didn't want to talk.	Janiwa, janiw parlañ munkänti.
He did it very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uk luräna.
That came from me.	Ukajj nayat jutäna.
Nothing, nothing.	Janiw kunas, janiw kunas.
I’m a little worried.	Nayax mä juk’a llakistwa.
But for that.	Ukampis ukatakix.
Does he really think so.	¿Chiqapunit ukham amuyi.
I never understand when he says that.	Kunapachatï ukham siski ukhajja, janipuniw amuykti.
This is him, he is.	Akax jupaw.
He was watching her better than she was.	Jupajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa uñchʼukiskäna.

He wanted more and more.	Jupajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw munäna.
There is no such good question.	Janiw ukham suma jisktʼajj utjkiti.
The man was with him.	Uka jaqejj jupampiw utjäna.

This world is very difficult.	Aka pachax wali ch’amawa.
Until now.	Jichhakamax.
This process can take a long time.	Ukham lurañatakejj walja tiempow munasispa.
He loved to play.	Jupajj anattʼañ wal munäna.
He really didn't know how to talk about it.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunjamsa uka tuqit parltʼañ yatkänti.
No one really knew what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw khitis cheqpachapun yatkänti.
I mean doing research.	Nayax yatxatañ lurañ sañ munta.
I just want to be like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw munta.
No one had ever said that to him before.	Janiw khitis nayrajj ukham jupar siskänti.
I think you are welcome.	Nayax amuyta, jumanakax wali askiwa.
I decided to go some time ago.	Nayax mä qawqha pachaw sarañ amtawayta.

The snow was slow.	Ukhamwa luräna.
It’s really okay.	Chiqpachansa walikïskiwa.
Well then that’s it.	Suma ukat ukhama.
He is very fond of her.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uñji.
But it’s not too bad here.	Ukampis aka chiqanx janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
I don’t really know what to do.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni kuns lurañ yatkti.
It took ten years.	Ukatakejj tunka maraw munasïna.
You don’t need to do that.	Jumax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
I’m happy to report that it worked.	Nayax wali kusisitaw yatiyañ munta, ukax wali askiwa.
I haven’t seen it all, of course.	Janiw taqpach uñjkti, chiqpachansa.
For twenty years he did so.	Pä tunka maranakaw ukham luräna.
So, he wanted a lot of stuff like that.	Ukhama, jupax walja yänak ukham munäna.
Why, he didn’t want to let go.	Kunatsa, janiw jaytañ munkänti.
So it would be very useful.	Ukhamajj wali askïspawa.
This is very unnecessary.	Ukajj wali jan wakiskiriwa.
He really doesn’t like me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayar munaskiti.
Of course, he said firmly.	Chiqansa, jupax wali chʼamampiw säna.
I don’t think there’s any money in it.	Nayatakix janiw kuna qullqis ukan utjkaspati.
Yours and mine and the whole country.	Juman ukat nayan ukat taqpach markan.
I guess you don’t.	Nayax amuyta, jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really don't like it that much.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham sinti gustkituti.
He stared at them for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa pachaw jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
But he said it.	Ukampis jupajj uk sänwa.
And so, of course, it is.	Ukat ukhama, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
I haven’t had a chance.	Nayax janiw mä ch’am jikxatkti.
Didn't mean harsh words sorry.	Janiw qhuru arunak arsuñ munkänti perdón.

I would really need help.	Nayajj wal yanaptʼa munasispa.
I’m definitely curious.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw yatxatañ munta.
No, the question was obvious.	Janiwa, uka jisktʼajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
Not the way you want it.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhama.
It's not what you think it is.	Janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhamäkiti.
This happened all the time.	Ukham lurañajj sapa kutiw pasäna.
I started doing that.	Nayax ukham lurañ qalltawayta.
That wasn't what he needed.	Ukajj janiw jupatak wakiskänti.
I’ve promised myself.	Naya pachpaw arsuwayta.
But he did it very well.	Ukampis wali sumwa luräna.
Too much haste in doing something.	Mä kun lurañatakix sinti jankʼakiw lurañasa.
I don't know how I did it, but it doesn't matter.	Kunjamsa uk lurawayta uk janiw yatkti, ukampis janiw kunäkisa.
This was discovered very early.	Ukajj wali nayraw jikjjatasïna.
This was not the real problem.	Ukajj janiw cheqpach jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
Actually, I’m afraid.	Chiqansa, nayax axsaratwa.
I haven’t seen these photos today.	Jichhürunakanx janiw uka fotonak uñjkti.

He went over it a few times.	Jupajj mä qhawqha kutiw uka toqet jukʼamp saräna.
That’s exactly what it was.	Ukax chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
It wasn’t like this now.	Janiw jichhax ukhamäkänti.

I don't know how long it will last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.
The character is very strong.	Uka chachax wali ch’amawa.
He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa munäna.
The process is difficult.	Uka lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
I personally appreciate that.	Naya pachpaw uka toqet wali askit uñjta.

Everything went well.	Taqi kunas wali sum sarxäna.
I don’t think that’s necessary.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasin amuyta.
As you can imagine.	Kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhama.
He never had any trouble walking.	Jupajj janipuniw sarkasajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I want to reach them with him.	Jupampiw jupanakar puriñ munta.
And you know what he said? 	Ukat ¿kunsa siskäna uk yattati?
I want to see him again.	Nayax jupar wasitat uñjañ munta.
It’s not necessary.	Janiw wakiskiti.
It’s really the only one.	Chiqpachansa, uka sapakiw utji.
Don't forget to do your homework now.	Jichhajj tareanak lurañ jan armasimti.
It’s something you never want to do.	Ukax mä kunaw jan kunapachas lurañ munktati.
I said thank you very much.	Nayax walpun yuspärta sasaw sista.

And this time, we’ll do it right.	Ukat aka kutix, sum lurañäni.

Too long, he thought.	Sinti jaya tiempow sasaw amuyäna.

It’s called that.	Ukax ukhama satawa.
He didn't want them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar munkänti.
But how is that.	Ukampis kunjamsa ukajja.
He died very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa jiwjjäna.
I agree with you more.	Nayax jumamp chikaw juk’amp jikxatastxa.

I did it very quickly.	Nayajj wali jankʼakiw uk lurayäta.
You can do one, a few or all of them.	Mä, mä qawqha jan ukax taqpach lurañamawa.
He didn't say anything to her.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupar arskänti.
So far, it’s been fine.	Jichhakamax walikïskiwa.
As far as I can tell.	Kunjamtï nayajj yatkta ukhama.
But there will never be a reason.	Ukampis janipuniw kuna razonas utjkaniti.

Thank you so much for a little help.	Mä jukʼa yanaptʼañatakejj walpun yuspärta.

There is only one other way.	Yaqha tuqitxa mä sapakiw utji.

But it doesn’t matter, really.	Ukampis janiw kunäkisa, chiqpachansa.
Overall it is very well located.	Taqi kunat sipansa wali suma uñt’atawa.

In three respects.	Kimsa tuqitxa.

He didn't want to say yes.	Jupajj janiw jïsa sañ munkänti.
And you know what, that’s okay.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa kunas, ukax walikïskiwa.
And they’re important.	Ukat jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
So I would argue that.	Ukhamajj nayajj ukham arsuñ munta.

This will of course require two people.	Ukax chiqpachansa pä jaqiruw munasini.

He just died like that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jiwjjäna.
And that’s what he doesn’t do.	Ukat ukax jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
So it seems to be a good thing.	Ukhamajj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
No one wanted to.	Janiw khitis munkänti.
I think that’s because this is it.	Nayax amuyta ukax kunatix akax ukhamawa.
He died three years later.	Jupajj kimsa mara qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
That’s what he wanted.	Uk jupajj munäna.

It’s what he wants to do.	Ukax kuntix jupax lurañ munki ukawa.
In fact, there is very little for you.	Chiqansa, jumatakix wali jukʼakiw utji.

He wants to get out.	Jupax mistuñ muni.
And if you have it, do it.	Ukat utjaspa ukhaxa, lurañamawa.
I don’t know why, he just does that.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, jupax ukhamakiw ukham luraski.
I say, yes and no.	Nayax siwa, jïsa ukat janiw.
It is hard for me to go anywhere.	Nayatakejj kawkirus sarañajj chʼamakiwa.
He’s obviously a big guy.	Jupax qhanaw jach’a jaqiwa.
Don’t be afraid.	Jan juk’ampi.

It’s very nice, very nice.	Ukax wali sumawa, wali sumawa.
Nothing looks fancy.	Janiw kunas wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamäkiti.

There really is nothing better to do.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.

I never wanted a big house.	Janipuniw mä jachʼa uta munkti.
But there was no need to do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas wakiskänti.
He didn't want her at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa jupar munkänti.
I really can't figure that one out.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka maynix amuytʼirjamäkti.
This one is really nice.	Akax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.

He was the one who started it.	Jupaw qalltäna.

It’s even more surprising.	Ukax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
It was like someone else.	Ukajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

But I understood something.	Ukampis kuns amuyayäta.

There is nothing wrong with what you are doing.	Kuntï luraskta ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.

And at least it’s worth it there.	Ukat mä juk’a pachax ukanx wali askiwa.

He wants to make them better.	Jupajj jupanakar jukʼamp sum lurañwa muni.
No one knew where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.

Let him know that you think it would be a good idea.	Ukax wali askïspawa sasin amuyta sasaw jupar yatiyañama.
I don’t think so, of course.	Janiw nayax uk amuykti, chiqpachansa.
But there is definitely room for improvement.	Ukampis cheqapuniw jukʼamp sum lurañajj utji.
But that takes time.	Ukampis ukatakejj tiempow munasispa.

But it’s very sad for me.	Ukampis nayatakix wali llakitaw jikxatasi.

He felt very good about himself.	Jupajj wali sumwa amuyasïna.

He recommended options.	Jupajj kunanaktï lurañ amtkäna ukanakaw ewjjtʼäna.

He said, “It’s a nice place.	Jupax akham sänwa.
I think that’s a lot of fun.	Nayax ukax wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyta.
But that is not enough in itself.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jupa pachpajj askïkiti.

He wouldn’t have done it.	Janiw uk lurkaspänti.

And everyone knows it.	Ukat taqiniw uk yatipxi.
I can't quite figure out why.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
I never meant anything bad about him.	Janipuniw jupat jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.
Well, no, really.	Ukhama, janiwa, chiqpachansa.

I haven’t seen him in a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw jan jupar uñjkti.

He gave her what she wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk churäna.

He wanted to see her.	Jupar uñjañ wal munäna.
I told him to do something.	Nayajj kun luram sasaw sista.

He meant what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk sañ munäna.

So he did just that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
It may never exist.	Inas janipuniw utjkaspati.
I love that so much.	Nayax ukax walpun munta.
He went faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw saräna.
So he went away.	Ukatwa jupajj saräna.
This is the most interesting.	Akax juk'amp askiwa.
He was the only one with her.	Jupa sapakiw jupamp chika sarnaqäna.
I can't have them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj utjkaspati.
And it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukat janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
And he didn't want that.	Ukat janiw uk munkänti.
So I want something to happen.	Ukhamajj kunas pasañap munta.

He knew with pain.	Jupajj wali llakitaw yatïna.
This is a very sensible thing to do.	Ukajj wali amuyumpiw luraski.

It matters less now.	Jichhax juk’a wakiskiriwa.
He does it wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw ukham luri.
Why doesn't that work.	Kunatsa ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
But this can do that.	Ukampis akax ukham luraspawa.
And he talked a lot about you.	Ukat jumat wal parläna.
He didn't have that in him, he thought.	Jupajj janiw ukajj jupan utjkänti, sasaw amuyäna.
I don't understand why he wants to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ muni uk janiw amuykti.
He’s an amazing guy.	Jupax mä muspharkañ jaqiwa.
But he can’t do that.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He was looking forward to seeing the city at night.	Jupajj arumaw uka markar uñjañ wal suyäna.
I am very happy about that.	Uka toqet wal kusista.
Nothing more than that.	Janiw kunas juk’ampi.

It looks very real.	Ukax wali chiqpach uñtatawa.
I don't see why not.	Kunatsa jan ukhamäki uk janiw uñjkti.
He didn't want to say no.	Jupajj janiw sañ munkänti.
More immediately he ordered himself.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw jupa pachpaw mayïna.
He doesn’t know it yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax uk yatkiti.
I was really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

This looks pretty bad.	Akax wali jan wali uñtatawa.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
I mean that’s the truth.	Nayax uka chiqaw sañ munta.
There’s a little more to do.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi lurañaw utji.
You can do it instead of him.	Jupat sipansa jumaw uk lurasma.

This will come in handy later.	Ukajj qhepat wali askiwa.

He looked half-starved.	Jupax chikat manq’at awtjataw uñnaqäna.
No one said anything to me.	Janiw khitis nayarojj kuns siskänti.

He didn’t mean sleep.	Jupax janiw ikiñ sañ munkänti.
I thought that was awesome.	Nayajj ukajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
I don't believe that.	Nayajj janiw ukham creykti.
He seems to be gentle.	Jupax llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
You do the talking, not him.	Jumaw parlañ lurañama, janiw jupajj lurañamäkiti.
But it only matters once.	Ukampis mä kutikiw wakisi.
All of this took hours.	Taqi ukanak lurañatakix walja horanakaw munasïna.
It wasn’t a film, but it would have made a great one.	Janiw mä película ukhamäkänti, ukampis mä jach’a película luraspänwa.
That’s because it doesn’t exist.	Ukax kunatix janiw ukax utjkiti.
He said it to himself.	Jupa pachpaw säna.
But he didn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns siskänti.

He’ll do it soon.	Jupax niyaw ukham lurani.

But you know the kind.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa uka kasta.

He’s doing it because it’s the right thing to do.	Jupax ukham luraski kunatix ukax wali askiwa.
Or don't do it right.	Jan ukajj jan sum luramti.
Something needs to be done.	Kunas lurañax wakisi.
That was rarely the case here.	Ukajj jukʼakiw aka cheqan utjäna.
Please let me know if that is right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk jumajj yatiyapjjeta.

Or whatever you need to do.	Jan ukajj kuna lurañas wakisispati.
He was better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.

In fact, it’s fun to go now.	Chiqansa, jichhax sarañax wali kusiskañawa.
He said no, it was fine.	Jupax janiw, walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
I never quite understood why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janipuniw sum amuykayätti.
I think that’s important and important.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali wakiskiriwa ukat wali wakiskiriwa.

It’s just, like that.	Ukax ukhamakiw, ukhama.
I don’t want that to happen.	Janiw ukham pasañap munkti.
It’s a little unusual.	Ukax mä juk’a jan uñt’atawa.
That’s okay, that’s it.	Ukax walikïskiwa, ukax ukhamawa.
Let's see what happens now.	Jichhajj uk uñjañäni.
It was just so nice.	Ukhama wali sumapunïnwa.
I don’t know why, but it was.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
He knew very well that tonight would be the night.	Jupax wali sum yatïna, jichha arumax uka arumaw utjani.
You know and it’s called.	Jumax yatisktawa ukat ukax satawa.
So he told himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa yatiyäna.
Or really that far, for that matter.	Jan ukax chiqpachansa ukhama jaya, uka tuqitxa.
I want to use cold water.	Nayax thaya uma apnaqañ munta.
This will be about the first year.	Ukajj niya nayrïr maraw pasani.
But you know what, it’s worth it.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa kunas, ukax wali askiwa.
Also, the following is the case.	Ukhamaraki, ukax akham sañ muni.
It is either right or wrong.	Ukajj walikïskiwa jan ukajj janiw walïkiti.
Maybe he doesn’t know enough.	Inas jupax jan sum yatkchiti.
I didn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkayätti.
I’ve got nothing for you.	Nayax janiw kuns jumatakix jikxatkti.

He didn’t know what time it was.	Jupax janiw kuna horasas uk yatkänti.

And he felt the same way.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
I love going to work.	Nayax irnaqäwir sarañax walpun munta.
So we are the same.	Ukhamajj jiwasajj ukhamarakiw.
He knew better than that.	Jupajj uka toqet jukʼamp sum yatïna.

Overall it was really good.	Taqi kunat sipansa chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I spent the day with him.	Nayax jupamp chikaw uka urux sarawayta.
He came later for me.	Jupax nayatakix qhipharux jutäna.
He said it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk säna.
Of course, that is not the case today.	Chiqansa, jichhürunakanxa janiw ukax utjkiti.
He immediately said no.	Jupajj jankʼakiw janiw sasaw säna.
I was just as good.	Nayax ukhamarakiw wali sumapunïnwa.
What will he do with it.	¿Kunsa jupajj lurani.
And he wants a little more.	Ukat mä jukʼa jukʼamp munaraki.
It could be a week, it could be two weeks.	Mä semanaw utjaspa, pä semanaw utjaspa.

The next rider is another good man.	Jutïr kayuk sarañax yaqha suma jaqiwa.
It didn't do that.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurkänti.

It doesn't matter if that's right or not.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha ukajj janiw kunäkisa.

He went to go with you.	Jupajj jumamp chik sarañatakiw saräna.

I didn’t want that, but it was.	Janiw uk munkayätti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
It always was, and it always will be.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa, ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
He stared at her for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Let me know what you think.	Jumax kuntï amuykta uk yatiyapxita.
She’s a strange woman.	Jupax mä jan uñt’at warmiwa.
As if no one really knew.	Janis khitis chiqpachapuni yatkaspa ukhama.
There is no such thing now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham utjkiti.

That's what makes me feel so good.	Ukaw wal sum jikjjatasta.

Tell me what is happening now.	Jichhajj kunas pasaski uk yatiyapjjeta.
I want a room.	Nayax mä cuarto munta.
He wanted something.	Jupax kuns munäna.
Keep it up for longer.	Jukʼamp tiempow ukanak lurañama.
Making small words is very difficult for me.	Jiskʼa arunak lurañajj nayatakejj wali chʼamakiwa.
I asked him what he was doing.	Ukat kunsa luraskta uk jisktʼta.
He was silent now.	Jichhax amukiw jikxatasïna.
So there is no problem.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
That seems like the worst thing a person can do.	Ukajj mä jaqejj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
Instead of the word.	Jan ukasti uka aru.
I don’t know what you’re saying you know.	Nayax janiw yatkti kuntix jumax yatisktawa siskta ukxa.

This he really can't do.	Aka jupax chiqpachansa janiw lurañjamäkiti.
And do what he has.	Ukat jupan utjki uk luram.
But now you have to do it right.	Ukampis jichhajj sum lurañamawa.

Let me know how you do it.	Kunjamsa lurasma uk yatiyapxita.
I want to do this job.	Nayax aka irnaqäw lurañ munta.

He’s leaving the country.	Jupax markat sarxani.
And it’s unknown.	Ukat jan uñt’atawa.
He asked the questions.	Jupaw uka jisktʼanak jisktʼäna.
Or so it used to be.	Jan ukajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.

He was the one who started it.	Jupaw uka qalltäna.
But whatever the point is.	Ukampis kunas ukajj uka tuqitxa walikïskiwa.
The man was silent.	Uka jaqejj amukiw jikjjatasïna.
He asked her how she was feeling.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta sasaw jisktʼäna.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Inas mä juk’a, inas walja.
This is especially true today.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj jukʼampiw uñjasi.

Well we have one.	Suma jiwasax mä.

And that’s what ultimately matters.	Ukat ukax qhipharux wali wakiskiriwa.
And he was sleeping soundly.	Ukat wali sum ikiskäna.
It’s always meant to be.	Ukax sapa kutiw sañ muni.
I think it’s going to be better.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juk’amp sumaw sañ muni.
But he didn't like it.	Ukampis janiw jupajj gustkänti.
I want to know who it is.	Khitis uk yatiñ munta.
He knew I would never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
This is obviously not the case.	Ukax qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
No one knows how it will turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj utjani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But no, it’s not right.	Ukampis janiw, janiw walïkiti.
That happened a lot.	Ukajj walpun pasäna.
He never hurt anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus jan walinak lurkänti.
I remember that well.	Uk sum amtasta.
He sat down for a moment with great satisfaction.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw mä jukʼa qontʼasïna.
It certainly wasn’t for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
I have no idea how he felt, or why.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna, jan ukajj kunatsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw amuykti.
He told me he didn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkti sasaw sitäna.
So I didn’t know how to get out of it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunjamsa ukat mistuñ yatkayätti.
He wanted her more than anything.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jupaw jukʼamp munäna.
There was no one there that night.	Uka arumax janiw khitis utjkänti.
I thought it came pretty soon.	Nayax wali jank’akiw purini sasaw amuyayäta.
There was never anything there, on my part.	Janipuniw kunas ukanx utjkänti, nayan tuqitxa.
You were the one he came after.	Jumaw jupajj qhepat jutäna.
Water.	Uma.
I need someone.	Nayax khitirus munta.
And everything is just that.	Ukat taqi kunas ukhamakiw.
That’s what happened here.	Ukaw akan pasäna.
In a weird way, that works.	Mä muspharkañ tuqitxa, ukax wali askiwa.
I didn't know that fact.	Nayajj janiw uka cheq yatkayätti.
That’s kind of weird to me.	Ukax nayatakix mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
No or yes.	Janiwa jan ukajj jïsa.
He said yes I can do that.	Jupajj jïsa uk lurasmati sasaw säna.
and don't forget.	ukat armasimti.
Once you do that, that’s it.	Mä kutix ukham lurasax ukax ukhamawa.
That’s kind of nice.	Ukax mä juk’a sumawa.
So, this is exciting.	Ukhama, akax wali kusiskañawa.
And now it can happen to you.	Ukat jichhax ukhamarakiw jumarux pasaspa.
I didn't know anywhere.	Nayajj janiw kawkirus yatkayätti.
I like them both.	Panpachaniw jupanakar gustitu.
I’m not saying they’re hard to ride.	Janiw nayax jupanakax ch’amaw kayuk sarañax sañ munkti.
That’s what he knew.	Ukaw uk yatïna.
I think I’ll have to do it tonight.	Nayax amuyta, jichha arumax lurañaw wakisispa.
No one was there for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
I guess tomorrow will be another day.	Nayax qharürux yaqha uruw sasaw amuyta.
I don't want to give up.	Nayajj janiw jaytañ munkti.
That’s what you’re feeling.	Ukhamaw jumax jikxatastaxa.
He was saying it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk siskäna.
That’s good enough for now.	Ukax jichhax wali askiwa.
And I realized what he was doing.	Ukat kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk amuyayäta.
I’ve done this before.	Nayax nayrax aka lurawayta.
He’s not worth it.	Jupax janiw askïkiti.
But this is more now.	Ukampis akax juk’amp jichhax.
But that takes some time.	Ukampis ukatakix mä qhawqha tiempow munasispa.
Everything and everyone there, except me.	Taqi kunas ukat taqiniw ukanx utji, nayax jan ukasti.
So it is very important to me.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
Not even a moment ago.	Janiw mä juk’a pachas nayrax utjkänti.
He is a man of truth.	Jupajj cheq parlir jaqewa.
Tell us a little bit about that.	Uka tuqit mä jukʼa yatiyapxita.
Where is he?.	¿Kawkinkis jupax?.
We can’t have that, you know that.	Jiwasax janiw ukham utjkaspati, jumax uk yatisktawa.
A little bit of a word.	Mä jisk’a aru.
That’s what you need if you want to go out.	Ukaw jumatakix wakisi, jumatix mistuñ munsta ukhaxa.
No one told him.	Janiw khitis jupar siskänti.
He was so excited he wanted to eat breakfast earlier.	Jupax wali kusisitaw nayrax desayuno manq’añ munäna.
He knew exactly what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk sum yatïna.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Jupajj uka toqet jumamp parlañ muni.
I am very happy about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He just sat there.	Jupajj ukhamakiw qontʼasïna.
You can do that.	Ukham lurasma.
There is nothing else like it.	Janiw kunas yaqha ukham utjkiti.
Or anytime, for that matter.	Jan ukax kuna pachas, ukatakix.
No, it’s still popular.	Janiwa, wali uñt’atawa.
I think it’s very, very difficult.	Nayax amuyta, wali, wali ch’amawa.
If you want to stay here.	Jumax akan qhiparañ munsta ukhaxa.
But he knew it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw uk yatïna.
But at the time, he was a very important person.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, jupajj wali wakiskir jaqënwa.
It doesn't matter why he did it.	Kunatsa uk luräna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
That’s good, it’s good.	Ukax wali askiwa, wali sumawa.
That could be a thing.	Ukajj mä kunaw utjaspa.
But something else just happened.	Ukampis yaqha kunas ukhamakiw pasäna.
I remember everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa amtasta.
He’s still alone.	Jupax wali sapakiw jikxatasi.
It just went away.	Ukajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
I have nothing of my own.	Nayajj janiw kunas nayajj utjkituti.
Thank you so much for that.	Uk walpun yuspärta.
So there we go!.	Ukhamajj ¡ukaruw sarapjjta!.
Or it could be both.	Jan ukajj panpachaniw utjaspa.
Do you know who he was.	¿Khitïnsa uk yattati.
I really, really loved it.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachapuniw munasïna.
Thank you all so much.	Taqiniruw walpun yuspärta.
Or he knew something about her.	Jan ukajj jupat kunsa yatïna.
I don't know why that didn't happen.	Kunatsa ukham jan paskäna uk janiw yatkti.
I’m fine with that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali sum amuyta.
The problem was now obvious.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj jichhajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
The .	Ukax .
Now I realize that’s not the case.	Jichhax amuyasta janiw ukhamäkiti.
He feels much better now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasi.
I understand that very well.	Uka toqet sum amuyasta.
That's all he said.	Ukakiw jupajj säna.
But there is no time.	Ukampis janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
There was nothing more important to do.	Ukat sipansa janiw jukʼamp wakiskir lurañajj utjkänti.
Every time someone talked about him.	Sapa kutiw maynix jupat parläna.
He understood what that meant to me.	Ukajj kunsa nayatakejj sañ munäna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
But both of these are valid.	Ukampis uka panpachaniw walikïskiti.
Two things happened.	Pä kunaw pasäna.
He knows now, at least.	Jupax jichhax yati, mä juk’a.
A man can do much worse.	Mä chachajj jukʼamp jan walinak luraspa.
So, it’s important to do.	Ukhama, lurañax wali wakiskiriwa.
I see it more now.	Jichhajj jukʼampiw uk uñjta.
It’s really hard.	Chiqpachansa wali ch’amawa.
There was never any time.	Janipuniw kuna horasas utjkänti.
You have to tell it to yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk yatiyañama.
It was a long time though.	Wali jaya tiempos ukhamänwa.
He lived a very long life.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow jakasïna.
But it doesn’t mean that.	Ukampis janiw sañ munkiti.
And you will feel better than any of you can imagine.	Ukat sapa mayniw kuntï amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum jikxatasïta.
I thought that was not unlikely.	Ukajj janiw jan ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
But that can be good for us.	Ukampis ukajj jiwasatak askïspawa.
You know what it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas uk.
I never thought it would go anywhere, but it did.	Janipuniw kawkirus sarxani sasin amuyirïkti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
But, anything can happen.	Ukampis, kunas pasaspa.
You didn't know what he thought about it.	Uka toqet kunsa jupajj amuyäna uk janiw yatkayätati.
Here’s why it’s not.	Akax kunatsa jan ukhamäki ukawa.
But I didn’t know much about him.	Ukampis janiw jupat sum yatkayätti.
I didn't really want to talk to him now.	Jichhajj janiw cheqpachapun jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
You understand that perfectly.	Jumax uk sum amuyta.
He’s the guy now.	Jupax jichhax uka waynawa.
But he didn't want anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns munkänti.
That’s something like that.	Ukax mä kunaw ukhama.
Later, I know better about it.	Qhepatjja, uka toqet jukʼamp sumwa yatta.
They’re really important.	Chiqpachansa jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
He makes a decision for himself.	Jupa pachpaw mä amtar puri.
Probably about twenty or so.	Inas niya pä tunka jan ukax ukhama.
No, thank you very much.	Janiwa walpun yuspärta.
He is going to town for it next month.	Jutïr phaxsinx ukatakix markaruw saraski.
Of course he knew it.	Chiqpachansa jupax uk yatïna.
And so far, so good.	Ukat jichhakamax, wali sumawa.
That was the end of it for me.	Ukaw nayatakejj tukuyäna.
I thought it would all come down to me.	Taqe kunas nayaruw purini sasaw amuyayäta.
He immediately phoned.	Jupajj jankʼakiw telefonot jawsäna.
He knew what he meant, but he didn't say it.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna, ukampis janiw uk siskänti.
So he decided to leave me.	Ukatwa nayat jaytañ amtäna.
Every day has been a great day.	Sapa uruw mä jach’a urux utjawayi.
It is doing more and more.	Ukajj jukʼampiw luraski.
No one stayed very long.	Janiw khitis sinti jaya tiempox utjkänti.
I wanted to get out of the car myself.	Naya pachpaw autot mistuñ munta.
They know both sides.	Jupanakax pä tuqit yatipxi.
I’ve been wanting to do one for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw mä lurañ munta.
This is really rare now.	Chiqpachansa akax jichhax juk’akiw utji.
This is what you want.	Akax kuntix jumax munkta ukawa.
He took things seriously.	Jupajj kunanaktï wali askit uñjäna.
After that, there was nothing.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kunas utjkänti.
And you can do it yourself.	Ukat juma pachpaw lurasma.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk siskänti.
You don’t want to know about it.	Jumax janiw uka tuqit yatiñ munktati.
And it doesn’t exist in any other country.	Ukat janiw yaqha markan utjkiti.
So he made this place.	Ukatwa jupajj aka cheq luräna.
Two things really.	Pä kunaw chiqpachansa.
I have some work to do.	Mä jukʼa lurañaw utjitu.
What would you like to do in the future?.	¿Kunsa jutïrin lurañ munasma?.
True every time.	Chiqa sapa kuti.
I thought it was awesome.	Nayax wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
It took them a long time to do this.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow jupanakajj munasïna.
A bad word.	Mä jan wali aru.
I decided to leave another room.	Nayax yaqha cuarto jaytañ amtawayta.
He was a human being. 	Jupajj jaqënwa. 
There will be something.	Kunas utjani.
I see how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk uñjta.
And that car.	Ukat uka auto.
But, not everything is like that.	Ukampis, janiw taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
Both are wrong.	Panpachaniw jan walïkiti.
It happened night after night.	Ukajj arumaw arumaw pasäna.
But here's the thing.	Ukampis aka.
He came on his own.	Jupa pachpaw jutäna.
I want to say thank you very much.	Nayax walpun yuspärta sañ munta.
You know the man is a bad guy.	Jumax yatisktawa uka jaqix jan wali jaqiwa.
I am glad to hear how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk istʼasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Still a little weird.	Wali mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
I’m the only one who exists.	Naya sapakiw utji.
But he didn't know exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkänti.
So much blood.	Ukhama walja wila.
Himself or me.	Jupa pachpa jan ukax naya.
So that’s what he did.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj luräna.
And the night came.	Ukat arumax purinïna.
How long did it take.	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna.
We will always do this.	Jiwasax sapa kutiw ukham lurañäni.
It feels like we did something she couldn't.	Kuntï jupajj jan lurañjamäki uk lurapkta ukhamwa amuyasi.
I listened to him for years.	Walja maranakaw jupar istʼta.
He came before everything else.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa nayraw jutäna.
We’re going to do it.	Jiwasax uk lurañäni.
But it doesn’t really work.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa irnaqkiti.
There is a bad situation.	Jan waliw utji.
He lives here.	Jupax akan jakasi.
But it seemed impossible.	Ukampis jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
But I don’t think he’ll do much here.	Ukampis janiw nayax akan wal lurani siskti.
He does not do these things.	Jupajj janiw uka lurañanak lurkiti.
She was looking at him sadly.	Jupajj llakitaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Do it as fast as you can.	Kunjamtï lurañjamäki uk jankʼakiw lurañama.
They have nothing to do with me.	Jupanakax janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
But someone else did.	Ukampis mayniw ukham luräna.
Everything feels good.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw jikxatasi.
We went there .	Jiwasajj ukaruw sarapjjta .
Something doesn’t matter.	Kunas janiw kunäkisa.
I find this all wrong.	Nayatakix akax taqpach jan waliw jikxatasi.
He may never know.	Inas janipuniw yatkchiti.
And he is important.	Ukat jupajj wali wakiskiriwa.
I look forward to the past.	Nayax nayra pacharuw suyt’ta.
I did the work myself.	Nayaw uka lurañanak lurawayta.
This was not mentioned anywhere.	Ukajj janiw kawkhansa arskänti.
You’re welcome!.	¡Jumax wali askiwa!.
We’ll have breakfast.	Jiwasax desayuno lurañäni.
It’s amazing to me.	Nayatakix muspharkañawa.
But in doing so, he knows who he is.	Ukampis ukham lurasajj khitïnsa uk sum yati.
I feel totally comfortable here.	Nayax akanx taqpach sumaw jikxatastxa.
And it happened several times, one way or another.	Ukat walja kutiw ukham pasäna, mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqit.
But the man was such a man.	Ukampis uka jaqejj ukham jaqënwa.
It means walking.	Ukax sarnaqañ sañ muni.
He didn’t quite know why.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk sum yatkänti.
Which is what he meant.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna ukawa.
You do what you do best.	Jumajj kuntï sum lurkta uk lurañamawa.
I'm really worried about that recently.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa jichhakiw llakista.
He looks older.	Jupax jilïr uñnaqaniwa.
You know what, no.	Jumax yatisktawa kuna, janiwa.
I think it’s bad.	Nayax jan waliw sasaw amuyta.
And there’s nothing you need to do.	Ukat janiw kunas lurañax wakiskiti.
I’m doing fine now.	Jichhax wali sum luraskta.
And he didn't want to do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
He looks familiar.	Jupax uñt’at uñnaqaniwa.
But it seems that this is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
That’s how you tell me.	Ukhamaw jumanakax nayar yatiyapxita.
It was very, very difficult for me.	Nayatakix wali, wali ch’amaw jikxatasïna.
But he could do nothing about it.	Ukampis uka toqet janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
Or not many people.	Jan ukajj janiw walja jaqenakajj utjkiti.
I didn’t want to see him like that.	Janiw jupar ukham uñjañ munkayätti.
It’s really exciting for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
I want to make it work.	Nayajj ukanak sum lurañwa munta.
But that doesn't mean it's impossible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti sañ munkiti.
I really don’t mean that.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax ukham sañ munkti.
That’s rare for me this year.	Ukax nayatakix aka marax juk’akiw utji.
He doesn't want you.	Jupajj janiw jumar munkiti.
And no one goes to bed.	Ukat janiw khitis ikiñar sarkiti.
You barely do anything about it.	Ukax juk’akiw jan kuns lurañamawa.
What happened next, it happened to me.	Kunas uka qhepat pasäna, ukajj nayaruw pasäna.
He didn’t say yes but he didn’t say no.	Jupax janiw jïsa siskänti ukampis janiw janiw siskänti.
These are all right to do.	Ukanak lurañajj walikïskiwa.
And it wants to work.	Ukat ukax irnaqañ munaraki.
I'm not sure how we're going to do that.	Kunjamsa uk lurañäni uk janiw sum yatkti.
It’s rulemaking at its best.	Ukax kamachinak lurañaw wali suma.
It’s really worth doing.	Chiqpachansa uka lurañax wali askiwa.
I did it and it worked.	Nayax uk lurawayta ukat wali askiwa.
If something happens to you.	Kunas jumar pasaspa ukhaxa.
I’m sorry it has to be done.	Nayax llakistwa ukax lurañaw wakisi.
Let's see how long it lasts.	Qhawqha tiempos utjaspa uk uñjañäni.
This is what you have.	Akax kunatix jumanakan utjki ukawa.
Of course I didn't know that.	Chiqansa janiw uk yatkayätti.
He wanted it to be so.	Jupajj ukhamwa munäna.
And you can’t have that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukax utjkaspati.
Without a home there is no future.	Jan utax janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti.
It took a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.
But at the time.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja.
I understand what he is thinking.	Kuntï jupajj amuyki uk sum amuyasta.
That was what he felt comfortable with.	Ukaw jupajj sum jikjjatasïna.
We’ll do that next time.	Jutïr kutin ukham lurañäni.
I didn't want to talk about the facts.	Janiw kunatï cheqäki uka toqet parlañ munkayätti.
You’re great !.	Jumax jach’a !.
Anyone could do these things.	Khitis ukanak luraspäna.
I never thought about it at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janipuniw uka toqet kuns amuyirïkti.
I want to know how to do it.	Nayax kunjams lurañax uk yatiñ munta.
You don’t need the money.	Janiw qullqix wakiskiti.
But, he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis, janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
It doesn't matter what you mean.	Kuntï sañ munkta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I'm going to get out of it tomorrow.	Nayax qharüruw uka tuqit mistuñ munta.
He could not eat.	Jupajj janiw manqʼañ puedkänti.
And it happened again.	Ukat wasitatwa pasäna.
He said something before that.	Uka nayrajj kuns arsüna.
He’s unique, of course.	Jupax jan uñt’atawa, chiqpachansa.
He told me that he was.	Jupajj sasaw sitäna.
He spoke very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa arsüna.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
He finally spoke up.	Jupajj qhepatwa arsüna.
But that’s exactly the point.	Ukampis ukax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
I have seen this happen many times.	Walja kutiw ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
That was what that meant.	Ukajj ukajj kuntï sañ munkäna ukhamänwa.
He has to do everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqi kun lurañapa.
And he meant well, he knew.	Ukat jupajj sum sañ munäna, uk sum yatïna.
He loved her and she loved him.	Jupajj jupar wal munasïna ukat jupajj jupar wal munasïna.
Also, the character.	Ukhamaraki.
But let’s face the harsh reality.	Ukampis uka qhuru cheqpach uñjañäni.
That was never the issue.	Ukajj janipuniw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
I did everything myself.	Naya pachpaw taqe kun lurayäta.
We're fine with that.	Jiwasajj ukajj walikïskiwa.
I know the facts.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatta.
Something like that, yeah.	Kunas ukhama, jïsa.
I love them so much.	Nayajj jupanakar walpun munasta.
Never a negative word, ever.	Janipuniw mä jan wali aru, janipuniw.
No one is outside now.	Jichhajj janiw khitis anqan utjkiti.
I didn’t know where to go.	Janiw kawkitsa sarañ yatkayätti.
So, this ended up being the first time.	Ukhama, akax nayrïr kutiw tukuyäna.
Well, this should do it.	Ukhama, akax lurañapawa.
I want to sleep myself.	Naya pachpaw ikiñ munta.
But there was no one.	Ukampis janiw khitis utjkänti.
Every time you do it, it feels like the first time.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurasma, nayrïr kutis ukhamwa amuyasi.
He said some strange things.	Jupax mä qawqha jan uñt’at arunak arsüna.
It wasn't the way he planned to go in.	Janiw kunjamtï mantañ amtkäna ukhamäkänti.
He decided to have a little party.	Jupax mä jisk’a fiesta lurañ amtäna.
At the time, I had no idea.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kuns amuykayätti.
I think it speaks for itself.	Nayax amuyta, ukax jupa pachpaw arsu.
But that’s all he says.	Ukampis ukakiw arsu.
I want to keep it up for now.	Jichhakamax ukham sarnaqañ munta.
I’m going for it, however long it takes.	Nayax ukatakix saraskta, qawqha pachas ukax wakisispa.
I didn’t tell him what to do with the ball.	Janiw nayax juparux kuns pelot lurañapatak siskti.
I said no he didn’t.	Nayax janiw sasaw sista jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I hope to use it one day.	Mä urux apnaqañ suyt’askta.
There is no reason for this.	Ukax janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
What are the.	Kunanakas uka.
I felt great again.	Nayax wasitat wali jach’a jikxatasiyäta.
He would have done the same.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw luraspäna.
Or anyone, really.	Jan ukax khitis, chiqpachansa.
I didn’t want to stay home.	Janiw utan qheparañ munkayätti.
There were no people.	Janiw jaqinakax utjkänti.
He knew a lot about it.	Jupajj walpun yatïna.
I want to know everything that’s going on here, everything that’s going on.	Nayax taqi kunatix akan utjki ukanak yatxatañ munta, taqi kunatix utjki ukanak yatxatañ munta.
Several times this evening, in fact.	Walja kutiw aka jayp’ux, chiqpachansa.
These people are very important to me.	Uka jaqinakax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
That’s the reason.	Ukax kunatsa.
I think that says a few things.	Nayax amuyta ukax mä qawqha arunak arsu.
He died three days later.	Jupajj kimsa uru qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
Who said the best so far, but now yourself.	Khitis jichhakamax wali suma säna, ukampis jichhax juma pachpa.
Here he was happy.	Aka chiqanx jupax kusisitaw jakasïna.
But he didn't understand.	Ukampis janiw jupajj amuykänti.
I expected this to happen.	Ukham lurasiñap suykayäta.

She’s a happy woman now.	Jupax jichhax kusisit warmiwa.
It used to be one.	Nayrajj mä ukhamänwa.
But now now.	Ukampis jichhajj jichhajj.
You say you want to be more human.	Jumax juk’amp jaqir tukuñ munta satawa.
He had never done this before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
Maybe he doesn’t know how.	Inas jupax kunjamsa uk jan yatkchiti.
It feels like this for no reason.	Jan kunatsa ukham amuyasi.
He didn't think it was going to happen to him.	Jupajj janiw jupar pasañap amuyaskänti.
I need more time.	Nayajj jukʼamp tiempow munasi.
He really didn’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
And there’s never been one like that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham maynix utjkiti.
Let’s see what works for you.	Kunas jumatak askïspa uk uñjañäni.
You want to leave and you don’t want to leave.	Jumax sarxañ munta ukat jan sarxañ munta.
But no, there is nothing.	Ukampis janiw, janiw kunas utjkiti.
That’s where it’s at.	Ukax kawkhans utji.

You should always do this.	Sapa kutiw uk lurañama.
No one wants to talk.	Janiw khitis parlañ munkiti.
All that blood.	Taqi uka wila.
When did this happen.	Kunapachas akax utjäna.
This is an unusual one.	Akax mä jan uñt’atawa.
Something is seriously wrong.	Kunas wali jachʼa jan waliw utji.
Also more expensive.	Ukhamaraki juk’ampi qullqi.
He was the one who saw it.	Jupaw uk uñjäna.
Many times before.	Walja kutiw nayrax.
And all the better for it.	Ukat ukatakix juk’amp askiwa.
He started skipping lunch.	Jupax chika uru manq’añ jaytañ qalltäna.
What he said is wrong.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna ukajj janiw walïkiti.
It was very quiet.	Ukax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
It was an hour before lunch.	Chika uru manqʼañatakejj mä horaw utjäna.
Well, yes of course.	Ukhama, jïsa chiqpachansa.
This looks awesome.	Akax wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
I had no idea what had happened or why.	Kunas pasäna, kunatsa pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
I don't remember much after that.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw sinti amtaskti.
Do the wrong thing.	Jan walinak luram.
He obviously did.	Jupax qhanaw ukham luratayna.
So many people didn't like it.	Ukhamajj walja jaqenakajj janiw ukajj gustkänti.
A great gift.	Mä jachʼa regalo.
He said you know.	Jupax yatisktawa sasaw säna.
Now you know, more or less.	Jichhax jumax yatisktawa, juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
That is the best way to do it now.	Jichhajj ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
The film is a national hit.	Película ukax markanx wali uñt’atawa.
He refused to eat.	Jupajj janiw manqʼañ munkänti.
The way he spoke.	Kunjamsa jupajj parläna.
I’m going to tell you.	Nayax jumaruw sañ munta.
He was alone, he had always been.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna, nayrax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
You are bigger than me.	Jumax nayat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa jaqïtawa.
No you’re not.	Janiwa jumaxa janiwa.
But I don't believe that.	Ukampis janiw uk creykti.
That’s what happened.	Ukax ukhamarakiw utjäna.
I don’t know what else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañanak yatkti.
He was really passionate about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet wal munasïna.
As if he knew what no one else was doing.	Kuntï jan khitis lurkäna uk yatkaspa ukhama.
I assured him he would do well.	Jupajj wali sumwa lurani sasaw sista.
No, a little bit more.	Janiwa, mä juk’a juk’ampi.

He was the only one who did it.	Jupa sapakiw ukham luräna.
He was the only one who thought.	Jupa sapakiw amuyäna.
Red snowflakes.	Wila ch’uqi ch’uqi.
You know that, but you don’t.	Jumax uk yatisktawa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I did it more often than not.	Nayajj jukʼampiw uk lurayäta.
But I'm pretty sure there isn't.	Ukampis janiw utjkiti sasaw wal yatta.
You have to do this every time.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurañama.
It is doing what needs to be done.	Kuntï lurañajj wakiski uk luraski.
He said that every year.	Sapa maraw ukham säna.
I was terrified of not doing that.	Nayajj jan ukham lurañajj wal ajjsarayäta.
We have so very little time here.	Ukham wali juk’a pachaw akan utjistu.
He couldn't control it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak apnaqañ puedkänti.
Not as it is now.	Janiw kunjamtï jichhajj utjki ukhama.
But there was no one outside.	Ukampis janiw khitis anqan utjkänti.
That's what I said.	Ukham sasaw sista.
Of course, there is no money.	Chiqansa, janiw qullqix utjkiti.
It was doing just fine.	Ukajj wali sum luraskäna.
And that’s really what he never had.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa jupax janipuniw utjkänti.
But this was no different.	Ukampis ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
But it took a year.	Ukampis mä maraw wakisïna.
It’s just one he handles well.	Mä sapakiw jupax wali sum apnaqi.
Not now, not anymore.	Janiw jichhax, janiw juk’ampi.
There’s no future there.	Ukanx janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti.
He’s the one who does everything.	Jupaw taqe kunsa luri.
Now let’s do it again.	Jichhax wasitat lurañäni.
He wanted to get her out of here.	Jupax aka chiqat apsuñ munäna.
But there was no problem.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
And so he is.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupax ukhama.
On the one hand, it kind of is.	Mä tuqitxa, mä kasta ukhamawa.
And it takes a lot of time.	Ukat walja tiempow munasispa.
Better than nothing at all.	Jan kunas utjki ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
He doesn’t know anything.	Jupax janiw kuns yatkiti.
I know what is in store for me.	Kunas nayatakejj utjani uk sum yatta.
I only did it once.	Mä kutikiw ukham lurawayta.
I understand that perfectly.	Nayax uk sum amuyta.
And that is unique.	Ukat ukajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
He decided to do some research himself.	Jupa pachpaw mä jukʼa yatxatañ amtäna.
Or so it will happen.	Jan ukajj ukham pasani.
No, you don’t have to do everything on your own.	Janiwa, janiw juma sapakix taqi kun lurañamäkiti.
That’s how you feel.	Ukhamaw jumax jikxatasïta.
I don’t know any time.	Nayax janiw kuna pachas uñt’kti.
But it takes a lot of time.	Ukampis walja tiempow munasispa.
I don't know what it was about.	Janiw yatkti kuna tuqitsa uka tuqit parläna.
I’ve only seen him about twice.	Niya pä kutikiw jupar uñjta.
Actually, that’s what it is.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.
There will be a tomorrow.	Mä qharüruw utjani.
That's what he told me.	Ukhamaw jupajj sitäna.
This is about right.	Akax niya chiqaw sañ muni.
I couldn’t do that to him.	Janiw jupar ukham lurirjamäkti.
But it is what is happening.	Ukampis ukajj pasaski ukawa.
Is that really what you need?.	¿Chiqapunit ukax jumatakix munasispa?.
Or you can make a great meal.	Jan ukajj mä jachʼa manqʼa lurasma.
There’s no time to sleep.	Janiw ikiñ pachax utjkiti.
I’ve barely seen it.	Nayax juk’akiw uñjta.

Something happening somewhere.	Kunas kawkhansa pasaspa.
But not now, not now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj utjkiti, janiw jichhajj utjkiti.
Those were the only two times he saw her.	Uka pä kutikiw jupar uñjäna.
He really understood.	Jupajj cheqapuniw amuyäna.
I don't understand why he does that.	Kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw amuykti.
In fact, that’s exactly what it did for me.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw nayatakix lurawayi.
I said there wouldn’t be.	Nayax janiw utjkaniti sasaw sista.
I’m still doing that.	Nayax wali ukham luraskta.
Now it’s hard to do something unusual.	Jichhax mä jan uñt’at lurañax ch’amawa.
There is a truth.	Chiqaw utji.
There are lots and lots of them.	Walja ukat walja ukanakaw utji.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Janiw ukham lurañapäkiti.
I’m so sorry about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But he’s good to me.	Ukampis jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Of course he was.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukhamänwa.
The facts are clear.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanawa.
Everything.	Taqi.
Or the week.	Jan ukax semana.
That’s a woman.	Ukax mä warmiwa.

And it looks awesome.	Ukat wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
It’s time to do it.	Ukax lurañ pachaw purini.

But he was right about the rain.	Ukampis jallu tuqitxa chiqaw säna.

He says goodnight, and waits.	Jupax suma arumaw siwa, ukat suyt’i.
The challenge is worth it.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj wali askiwa.
Instead, it’s the heart.	Jan ukasti chuyma.
That was the best thing that ever happened to her.	Ukaw kunatï jupar paskäna ukanakat wali sumapunïnwa.
Don’t do too much.	Janiw sinti lurañamäkiti.

It’s been a long time coming.	Jaya pachaw ukax wakisi.
I don’t want to live here.	Janiw akan jakañ munkti.

He was afraid of everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa ajjsaräna.
How he could do anything.	Kunjamsa jupajj kunsa luraspäna.
So we went to the gym.	Ukatwa sarapjjta.
That happened a little bit.	Ukajj mä jukʼa pasäna.

I haven’t seen them.	Nayax janiw jupanakar uñjkti.
As I say, as it goes.	Kunjamtï nayajj siski ukhama, kunjamtï ukajj saraki ukhama.

Tonight, he didn’t care.	Jichha arumax, jupax janiw kuns lurkänti.
He does what he says he will do.	Kuntï siski uk luri.
And he refused to eat her.	Ukat janiw jupar manqʼañ munkänti.
What do you want to see in the future?.	¿Kunsa jutïrin uñjañ munta?.
So I wasn't sure why.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukham sista uk janiw sum yatkayätti.

What is the right thing to do?.	¿Kunsa lurañasa?.

No one really did.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.

But no, he wasn't.	Ukampis janiw, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Thank you so much!!!.	Walpun yuspärta!!!.
He didn't want to go anywhere.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañ munkänti.
In terms of small amounts.	Jisk’a qullqi tuqitxa.
It doesn't matter if it will do him any good.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, ukajj jupar sum lurani.

But tell us more about that.	Ukampis uka toqet jukʼamp yatiyapjjeta.
Or whatever.	Jan ukajj kuna.

And very quickly.	Ukat wali jankʼakiw.

But of course everyone knows it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa taqiniw uk yatipxi.
But now it seems otherwise.	Ukampis jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
But that was not a season.	Ukampis ukajj janiw mä pachan utjkänti.

There was very little light.	Ukanjja wali jukʼa qhanaw utjäna.
Or no, no, no.	Jan ukax janiwa, janiwa, janiwa.

There is one more thing.	Mä jukʼampiw utji.
And he wanted to come, he said.	Ukat jupax jutañ munäna, sasaw säna.
He stayed there for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow ukan qheparäna.
This process takes some time.	Uka lurañax mä juk’a pachaw munasispa.
He worked there for twenty years.	Ukanjja, pä tunka maranakaw irnaqäna.

Now I know everything.	Jichhajj taqe kunwa yatta.

He didn't want to see anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns uñjañ munkänti.

He doesn't do that much.	Jupajj janiw ukham sinti lurkiti.

And he really didn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkänti.

He’s got every single thing out there.	Jupax sapa mayniw ukan jikxatasi.

It’s really really really hard.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa chiqpachansa ch’amawa.

I knew exactly why he wanted to go in there.	Kunatsa uka utar mantañ munäna uk sum yatiyäta.
He did the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï walïki uk luräna.
But then again, again.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa.
And everything else is fine though.	Ukat taqi kunas ukat walikïskiwa ukampis.
He was very quiet.	Jupajj wali amukiw sarnaqäna.
He wasn't like that now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukhamäkänti.
He rang the phone.	Jupajj telefonot jawsäna.
I don't want to know if he's right for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw yatiñ munkti.

I'm actually looking forward to seeing that.	Chiqansa, uk uñjañ wal suytʼaskta.

He really wants to talk to you.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw jumamp parltʼañ muni.
I did the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw lurayäta.
Please let us know immediately.	Jank’akiw yatiyapxita.
No one had a letter for him.	Janiw khitis jupatak mä carta utjkänti.
And he knew what the problem was.	Ukat kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna uk sum yatïna.

There was never enough time.	Janipuniw tiempojj utjkänti.

In fact, there was nothing to do.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.

He certainly did, he said.	Chiqpachansa uk luräna, sasaw säna.
So, it’s very important to me.	Ukhama, nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s best to do this early on.	Uk lurañax nayraqat lurañax wali askiwa.
You never knew when it was coming.	Kunapachas jutani uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
And everyone has a unique challenge.	Ukat sapa mayniw mä sapa jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
But he saw only one.	Ukampis mä sapakiw uñjäna.
Something else came to me.	Yaqha kunaw nayar jutäna.
But often there is no reason for this.	Ukampis walja kutiw uka tuqitxa janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
Don’t do it yet.	Janiw jichhakamax uk luramti.
Just like a year ago.	Kunjamtï mä mara nayrajj lurkäna ukhama.
You can’t do both at once.	Janiw mä kutin uka pä lurañanak lurañjamäkiti.
But he was surprised by me, he said.	Ukampis nayat wal muspharäna, sasaw jupajj säna.

He decided to do a lot of things.	Jupax mä walja lurañanak lurañ amtäna.
Something very important.	Kunas wali wakiskiriwa.

He saw her do it.	Jupajj uk lurir uñjäna.
But he didn't think that would happen here.	Ukampis janiw akan ukham pasañap amuykänti.
Foolish, he told himself.	Loqhe, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.

And the other one.	Ukat maynix.

At that point you’re happy and he’s not.	Uka pachanx jumax kusisitaw jikxatasïta ukat jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.

And there was no time.	Ukat janiw tiempojj utjkänti.

No one knows where he went or what he did.	Kawkirus saräna, ni kunsa luräna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But we will do that later.	Ukampis qhepatwa uk lurañäni.
He never had so many.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham walja jaqenakajj utjkänti.

He never liked them.	Jupajj janipuniw jupanakar gustkänti.
To be honest, he thought that was really weird.	Chiqpachansa, ukax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa sasaw amuyäna.
I really love that.	Chiqpachansa ukax walpun munasta.
That is not good for you.	Ukajj janiw jumatak askïkiti.
He was shocked to see me.	Jupajj nayar uñjasajj wal muspharäna.
It’s pretty obvious by now.	Jichhakamax wali qhanaw uñjasi.
I wasn't sure what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
He was in trouble, in big trouble.	Jupax jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna, jach’a jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
I didn’t tell him that.	Janiw nayax jupar ukham siskti.
He got the job less than two years ago.	Jupajj janïr pä maraw uka trabajo katoqäna.
So that doesn't work for me.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw nayatakejj walïkiti.
He loved her so much.	Jupajj walpun jupar munäna.
A few times.	Mä qawqha kuti.
It doesn’t mean a thing.	Janiw mä kuns sañ munkiti.
It’s been around for a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw utji.
Long and spacious.	Jaya ukat jach’a.
I love these so much.	Nayax ukanak walpun munasta.
A good time.	Mä suma tiempo.
He’s got to do something right.	Jupax kuns chiqapar lurañapawa.
He couldn’t sleep that night.	Uka arumax janiw ikiñ puedkänti.
You are a single woman.	Jumax mä sapa warmiwa.
I really felt a little uncomfortable.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa jan waliw jikxatasiyäta.
Therefore, he died.	Ukatwa jupajj jiwjjäna.
I drink coffee.	Nayax café umañ yatta.
He didn’t do that that day.	Uka urux janiw ukham lurkänti.
And it’s not.	Ukat janiw.
I thought that was the case.	Nayajj ukhamwa amuyayäta.
But he had a lot of questions.	Ukampis jupajj walpun jisktʼasïna.
He just told me that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw sitäna.
But this man had none of that.	Ukampis aka jaqejj janiw uka toqet kuns amuykänti.
I understood his feelings.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum amuyayäta.
But let’s get this straight.	Ukampis jichhax aka tuqit chiqapar uñjañäni.
I realized what had just happened.	Kunatï jichhak paskäna uk amuyayäta.
Is there anything wrong with that?.	¿Ukax kunas utji?.
Or both ways.	Jan ukax pä tuqitsa.
Or maybe he was making it up .	Jan ukajj inas jupajj luraskäna ukhama .
What did he do with it.	¿Kunsa jupajj luräna.
He’s a good guy, too.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
I just saw him recently.	Jichhakiw jupar uñjta.
It was what he did best.	Kuntï jupajj jukʼamp sum lurkäna ukawa.
He could not leave his house.	Jupajj janiw utapat mistuñ puedkänti.
Not a good year by any means.	Janiw mä suma marax kuna tuqitsa.
I never knew it.	Janipuniw yatkti.
I don’t want to give it up.	Janiw uk jaytañ munkti.
But the point is clear.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
I have felt that many times.	Nayajj walja kutiw ukham amuyayäta.
It happened every time.	Sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
It wasn’t like it was.	Janiw kunjamtï utjkänti.
We have all day tomorrow for that.	Ukatakix qhipürux taqpach uruw utjistu.
He saw pictures.	Jupajj fotonak uñjäna.
I’m not sure why it doesn’t work.	Nayax janiw kunatsa jan irnaqkiti ukx yatkti.
I really mean that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham sañ munta.
He thought it was pretty cool.	Jupax wali sumaw sasaw amuyäna.
You give him one.	Jumax juparux mä.
This isn’t about a major negative this year.	Akax janiw mä jach’a jan wali tuqitx aka marax utjkiti.

It’s raining, but it’s awesome.	Jallu purini, ukampis wali muspharkañawa.
I repeat that again.	Nayajj wasitatwa ukham sista.
But I don't know how.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
I almost did it myself.	Niya naya pachpaw uk lurawayta.
I really didn’t know what to do.	Chiqpachansa janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
I want to know about this.	Nayax aka tuqit yatxatañ munta.
Night or day.	Arumax jan ukax uru.
The man was an adult.	Uka jaqejj jilïr jaqënwa.
I don’t think it means anything.	Nayax janiw kuns sañ munkiti sasaw amuyta.
That will take another few hours.	Ukatakejj yaqha mä qhawqha horanakaw munasini.
That's why he does it.	Ukatwa jupajj ukham luri.
I just feel so bad.	Nayax ukhamakiw wali jan walin jikxatastxa.
I have doubts about it.	Nayax pächastwa.
I can’t believe that in anyone.	Janiw khitirus ukham iyaw sañjamäkiti.
No one knows what it is.	Janiw khitis uk yatkiti.
I’m more comfortable in it.	Nayax juk’amp sumaw ukan jikxatastxa.
I never expected it to happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurañap suykayätti.
Nothing more or less.	Janiw kunas juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
He will get through it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa pasani.
If you really want to.	Chiqpachansa munsta ukhaxa.
You know and this is the first time.	Jumax yatisktawa ukat akax nayrïr kutiw.
That has nothing to do with you.	Ukajj janiw jumamp kuns lurkiti.
He stayed there for hours.	Ukat walja horanakaw uka cheqan qheparäna.
He didn't quite agree.	Jupajj janiw sum iyaw siskänti.
He said more than that.	Jupajj jukʼampiw säna.
This is a very difficult one.	Akax mä wali ch’amawa.
I didn't know what would work for me.	Kunas nayatakejj askïspa uk janiw yatkti.
He said it didn’t matter.	Jupax janiw kunäkisa sasaw säna.
A breeze a bit right.	Mä thaya mä juk’a chiqa.
He had never been home before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj utapan utjkänti.
I think you can do better.	Nayax amuyta, jumax juk’amp sum lurasma.
He saw again how much she longed for him.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupajj wal munäna uk wasitatwa uñjäna.
No one knew better than he did.	Janiw khitis jupat sipan jukʼamp sum yatkänti.
I don’t know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
How he felt about it.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna.
You don’t want to know.	Jumax janiw yatiñ munktati.
The weather is amazing today.	Jichhürunakanx pachax wali muspharkañawa.
But it’s not necessary.	Ukampis janiw wakiskiti.
I think it’s really good for me.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachans nayatakix wali askiwa.
Now two years later.	Jichhajj pä mara qhepatjja.
But let’s do it right.	Ukampis sum lurañäni.
It may take longer.	Inas jukʼamp tiempojj munasispa.
I have no idea what is going on here.	Kunatï akan pasaski uk janiw amuykti.
He told me he was fine and very happy.	Jupax wali suma ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasi sasaw sitäna.
I don’t like anything about you.	Janiw jumanakat kuns gustkituti.
At least once a week.	Semanan mä kutis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I thought it would be good.	Nayax wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
I decided to hurry up.	Nayajj jankʼak lurañwa amtawayta.
I'm hungry for food.	Nayax manq'at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
It doesn’t matter how someone has been in the past.	Kunjamsa maynix nayrax jikxatasïna ukax janiw kunäkisa.
He hoped it would happen soon.	Ukajj jankʼakiw pasani sasaw suyäna.
More surely to come.	Juk’amp chiqaw jutani.
I had always thought .	Nayajj nayratpachaw amuyayäta .
He really wanted to talk to her today.	Jichhürunakan jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
But he said something.	Ukampis jupajj kuns arsüna.
I need help immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw yanaptʼa munta.
He wasn't really like that.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
Just like you know.	Kunjamtï jumax yatkayäta ukhama.
You don't have to do that.	Janiw jumajj ukham lurañamäkiti.
He obviously thought so.	Jupajj qhanaw ukham amuyäna.
I’m feeling pretty good.	Nayax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He saw a really good one.	Jupajj cheqapuniw mä sum uñjäna.
A couple of weeks ago approx.	Mä pä semana nayrajj niya.
I knew exactly what he was doing.	Kuntï lurkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
But now tell me something else.	Ukampis jichhax yaqha tuqit yatiyapxita.
You know exactly what you want.	Kuntï munki uk sum yatta.
I know not to do that.	Ukham jan lurañatakejj sum yatta.
That’s not really the case.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
Only a couple of times.	Mä pä kutikiw ukham luräna.
But it’s really worth it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
That’s what’s cool.	Ukax kunas wali sumawa.
That time doesn't matter.	Uka tiempojj janiw kunäkisa.
Long place, and very nice.	Jaya chiqa, ukat wali suma.
I think that’s not a bad thing.	Nayax amuyta ukax janiw jan walïkiti.
I really want to know the truth.	Chiqpachansa, kunatï cheqäki uk yatiñ munta.
He knew what would do that.	Jupajj kunatï ukham lurani uk sum yatïna.
There was no reason to go home.	Utar sarañatakix janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
What is the best thing to do?.	¿Kuna lurañas wali askïspa?.
They have more than enough.	Jupanakajj jukʼampiw utji.
He knows nothing else.	Jupajj janiw yaqha ukham yatkiti.
He learned from it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa yateqäna.
Red.	Wila.
Very nice, but very impersonal.	Wali sumawa, ukampis wali jan jaqiwa.
And, it really isn’t.	Ukat, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t remember where.	Janiw kawkhans amtaskti.
Honestly, I think that’s a good thing.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Or yesterday morning.	Jan ukax qharüru alwaw.
I liked this long enough.	Nayax aka jaya pachax walpun gustitu.
And he didn't want to go.	Ukat janiw sarañ munkänti.
You won’t be able to do it any other way.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax utjkaniti.
Any kind and size.	Kuna kasta ukat jach’a.
It seemed kind to him.	Ukajj jupar suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
What happens in the future.	Kunas jutïrin pasaspa.
It’s really a light.	Chiqpachansa mä qhanawa.
So he did well.	Ukhamajj jupajj sumwa luräna.
Now that could be something.	Jichhax ukax mä kunaw utjaspa.
He understood her feelings in every way.	Jupajj taqe toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sumwa amuyäna.
I expected the same here.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw aka cheqan suykayäta.
I’m not sure what’s good.	Nayax janiw kunas askïspa ukx yatkti.
I had nothing better to do.	Janiw jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkitänti.
It’s a long way to go.	Ukax jaya pachaw purini.
I want to know how he is doing.	Kunjamsa jupax sum sarnaqaski uk yatiñ munta.
Of course, this is impossible.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
It was how he knew the game.	Ukajj kunjamsa uka anattʼañ yatïna.
Maybe a lot of it.	Inas walja.
I might want to play it again soon.	Inas niyaw wasitat uka anattʼañ munta.
I know where he will be.	Nayajj kawkinsa jupajj utjani uk yattwa.
I couldn't think any more.	Janiw jukʼamp amuytʼirjamäkti.
I didn’t know when he would do it again.	Kunapachas wasitat lurani uk janiw yatkayätti.
He’s still in trouble.	Jupax wali jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
I don't like it now.	Jichhajj janiw nayajj gustkituti.
I know exactly who he is.	Nayax khitïnsa uk sum yatta.
That’s where he went.	Ukaw jupajj saräna.
And so he told me.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj sitäna.
Twice the size.	Pä kuti jach’a.
But you understand well.	Ukampis jumax sum amuyta.
What’s more important.	Kunas juk’ampi wakisi.
And another ten.	Ukat yaqha tunka.
He himself did not want to know.	Jupa pachpajj janiw uk yatiñ munkänti.
I really really don’t want to know.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa janiw yatiñ munkti.
But honestly, it will be here longer than anyone wants.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, khitis munki ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow akan utjani.
That is what he wants to do.	Ukaw jupajj lurañ muni.
Something real needs to be done, and it needs to be done quickly.	Kunas chiqpach lurañax wakisi, ukat jank’akiw lurañapa.
That’s exactly how long you’ll be here.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw qawqha pachas akanx utjani.
Now tell me what you want.	Jichhajj kuntï munkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
I didn’t expect that.	Janiw uk suykayätti.
But he was very cautious.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
You have to do the best you can.	Jumax wali suma lurañamawa.
I want to do my own books.	Naya pachpaw libronak lurañ munta.
But he doesn't do that anymore.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp ukham lurkiti.
I’m looking forward to everything but winter.	Nayax taqi kuns suyaskta jan ukasti juyphi pacharuw suyt’ta.
Lunch was delicious.	Chika uru manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa.
All of these can be very useful.	Taqi ukanakax wali askïspawa.
He said something.	Jupax kuns sänwa.
That would be a good thing, that would be a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïspawa, ukajj wali askïspawa.
No one knows who he did it with.	Janiw khitis khitimpis lurkäna uk yatkiti.
And now it is.	Ukat jichhax ukhamawa.
I still feel sad today.	Jichhürunakanxa wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I’m going to do the same thing.	Nayax uka pachpa lurañ amtasta.
I don’t know anyone.	Nayax janiw khitis yatkti.
I know how things are.	Kunjamsa kunas utji uk sum yatta.
Well, you know better.	Ukhamajj jumaw jukʼamp sum yatta.
At the time, I did not know why.	Uka tiemponjja, kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
We still have some time.	Jiwasax wali mä juk’a pachaw utjistu.
You don’t want to miss it.	Janiw ukanak jaytañ munktati.
Let me see what you think.	Kunsa jumajj amuyi uk uñjañäni.
I don't know how to go from here nothing works.	Nayax janiw kunjams aka chiqat sarañ yatkti janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
He had no idea that he might be in trouble.	Inas jan waltʼäwin uñjasispa sasin janiw amuyaskänti.
The question was what to do.	Uka jisktʼajj kunsa lurañasa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
That’s not any better.	Ukax janiw juk’amp askïkiti.
That was the last step.	Ukaw qhep qhepa lurañajj utjäna.
But this is not a quick fix.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.
He happened to me.	Jupajj nayaruw pasäna.
So, he decided not to say anything.	Ukatwa, jan kuns arsuñ amtäna.
And here’s the funny thing.	Ukat akax wali muspharkañawa.
The local boy did well.	Uka markankir waynax suma luratayna.
I think you know exactly what’s next.	Nayax amuyta, jumax sum yatisktawa kunas jutïrin utjani.
I want to do the work.	Nayax uka lurañanak lurañ munta.
The question is more important.	Uka jisktʼajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
He knows how to do everything.	Jupax taqi kuns lurañ yati.
You are a good person, don't forget.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa, jan armasimti.
He ended up there for a week.	Jupajj mä semanaw ukan tukuyäna.
I was more nervous than he was.	Nayajj jupat sipansa jukʼampiw ajjsarayäta.
But that's just the way it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamakiw.
I don’t plan on doing anything.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañ amtaskti.
He could be the only one.	Jupa sapakiw uka jaqejj utjaspa.
He new knows what to do.	Jupax machaq yatiw kuns lurañapa.
There is never a snowflake.	Janipuniw utjkiti.
He said he didn't know much about it.	Janiw uka tuqit sinti yatkiti sasaw säna.
I rode both ways.	Nayax panpachaniw kayuk sarawayta.
He is making sure that doesn't happen.	Jupajj jan ukham lurañapatakiw luraski.
I saw him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjta.
It just got harder and harder.	Ukajj jukʼampiw jukʼamp chʼamachasïna.
That just happened to me.	Ukajj nayarojj ukhamakiw pasäna.
It was one thing after two.	Ukajj pä qhepat mä kunaw utjäna.
There was no need to do this.	Uka lurañajj janiw wakiskänti.
That’s the reality.	Ukaw cheqpach utji.
But I didn’t, obviously.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkti, qhanawa.
These are the most beautiful.	Ukanakajj wali sumawa.
Such people are rare, as you yourself know.	Ukham jaqenakajj janiw sinti utjkiti, kunjamtï juma pachpa yatkta ukhama.
I really didn’t understand.	Chiqpachansa janiw amuykayätti.
The breakfast was really good.	Chiqpachansa desayuno ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
He stayed half an hour.	Jupajj chika horaw qheparäna.
Maybe this will be a while…	Inas akax mä juk’a pachax...
But I didn't think he would do much about it.	Ukampis uka toqet wal lurani sasin janiw amuyirïkti.
No, not once.	Janiwa, mä kutis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't know her name.	Jupajj janiw sutip yatkänti.
He didn't want to say anything to her.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupar sañ munkänti.
Money, money, money.	Qullqi, qullqi, qullqi.
This has not always been the case.	Ukajj janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.
And you’ll be there with him.	Ukat jumax jupamp chikaw ukan jikxatasïta.
He was a real villain.	Jupajj cheqpach jan wali jaqënwa.
I listen to it at least once a week.	Semanan mä kutis istʼta.
There you want something.	Kuna jumax kuns munta.
He says it’s good to go now.	Jichhax sarañax wali askiwa sasaw saraki.
And that means one of two things happened.	Ukat ukax pä tuqit mayniw pasäna sañ muni.
I didn't really understand what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
Well, he wanted to do it as soon as possible.	Ukhama, jupax jank’akiw uk lurañ munäna.
He told me what he wanted.	Jupaw kuntï munkäna uk sitäna.
You don’t have one.	Jumax janiw mä juk’a.
It did nothing for me.	Janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkänti.
The problem is much more interesting.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj jukʼamp sumawa.
He said he didn’t want one.	Jupax janiw mä munkti sasaw säna.
And that’s rare.	Ukat ukax juk’akiw utji.
He learned quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw yateqäna.
He had nothing to say about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns sañ munkänti.
He threw it at me.	Jupajj nayaruw jaqontäna.
No, that doesn't matter.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
But the timing is worth it.	Ukampis uka tiempojj wali askiwa.
They are very important to me.	Jupanakax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Janiwa, janiw kunas askïkiti.
That’s how he kept coming.	Ukhamaw sapa kuti jutäna.
But we have one thing to do.	Ukampis mä lurañaw utjistu.
I want to know what I am doing.	Kunsa luraskta uk yatiñ munta.
Well, so much.	Ukhama, ukhama.
He finally sees fit for me.	Jupax qhipharux nayatakix wali askiwa sasaw uñji.
He had done it before.	Jupajj nayraw uk luratayna.
It’s worth the money.	Ukax qullqix wali askiwa.
Blood, so much blood.	Wila, ukhama walja wila.
He walked in silence.	Jupax amukiw sarnaqäna.
No, he meant to say.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj sañ munäna.
Jiwasajj.	Jiwasajj.
But he moved very quickly.	Ukampis wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I just listened to part of it.	Jichhakiw mä chikat istʼta.
He wasn't like that before.	Jupajj nayrajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Everything went quiet.	Taqi kunas amukiw sarxäna.
It was very, very good.	Ukajj wali, wali sumapunïnwa.
Right, right, right.	Ch’iqa, ch’iqa, ch’iqa.
There’s something more there.	Ukanx juk’amp kunas utji.
Not yet available.	Janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
He said again and again.	Jupajj wasitatwa säna.
Many times he’s been very successful.	Walja kutiw jupax wali sum sarnaqäna.
I can never remember him being this nice.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham suma jaqëtap amtaskti.
What happened was.	Kunatï paskäna ukajja.
That will never happen.	Ukajj janipuniw utjkaniti.
But the boy is very quiet.	Ukampis uka waynax wali amukiw.
I think that’s very important.	Nayax ukax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
That's probably what you want.	Ukajj inas jumajj munsta.
Much later, he asked two more questions.	Walja tiempo qhepatjja, jukʼamp pä jisktʼanak jisktʼäna.
The past doesn’t mean anything.	Nayra pachax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I didn't think so.	Janiw nayajj ukham amuyirïkti.
Without you people, none of this is possible.	Jan jumanakax jaqinakax janiw kunas ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
I think you understand.	Nayax amuyta jumax amuyta.
And he says no.	Ukat jupax janiw sasaw saraki.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Janiw ukax askïkiti.
It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other.	Nayatakix janiw kunas mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqitxa.
He bought half of me.	Jupajj nayat chikat alasïna.
No no, there’s something worse.	Janiwa janiwa, juk’ampi jan waliw utji.
Something strange and new, something you might like.	Kunas muspharkañ ukat machaq, kunatix jumatakix wali askïspawa.
I had no idea how it was going to happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
And he didn’t want to give it to her.	Ukat janiw uk churañ munkänti.
Or at least it was.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamänwa.
You have to do these things well.	Ukanakat sum lurañamawa.
He didn't want anyone to drink.	Jupajj janiw khitirus umañ munkänti.
I would definitely stay here again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat akan qhiparañ munta.
The guy is really nice.	Uka waynax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I don’t like that.	Janiw ukax gustkituti.
Instead, it’s beautiful.	Jan ukasti wali sumawa.
I think it’s pretty cool.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali sumawa.
I am glad to hear from you.	Jumanakat istʼasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
But there is one thing that trumps all of this.	Ukampis mä kunaw taqe ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp askejja.
I didn’t know they might be needed.	Inas jupanakax munasispa uk janiw yatkayätti.
He could have done much worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak luraspäna.
What’s more.	Kunas juk’ampi.
I think this is interesting.	Nayax amuyta akax wali askiwa.
This is what I’m most excited about.	Akax nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
Or, at least, me.	Jan ukax, mä juk’a pachax, nayax.
Someone is doing it.	Mayniw uk luraski.
It was someone else.	Ukajj yaqha jaqënwa.
But very, very far away.	Ukampis wali, wali jaya.
I don't care who he is or how he got here.	Khitïnsa, kunjamatsa aka cheqar purini ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.
Nobody likes that.	Janiw khitis ukham gustkiti.
He died a year later.	Jupajj mä mara qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
So that would have done it.	Ukhamajj ukajj luraspänwa.
The truth is beyond me.	Chiqaw nayat sipansa.
Whatever happens is fine.	Kunas pasaspa ukajj walikïskiwa.
I don't want to talk about it on the phone.	Janiw uka toqet telefonot parlañ munkti.
Your feelings about it matter.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But that now seemed impossible.	Ukampis ukajj jichhajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I don’t need the money.	Nayax janiw qullqix munaskiti.
I feel sad doing it.	Nayax uk lurasax llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He can never do anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurkaspati.
He did very, very well.	Jupajj wali, wali sumwa luräna.
He did not comment again this morning.	Jupax janiw jichhür alwax wasitat arskänti.
Not yet, he thought.	Janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkiti, sasaw amuyäna.
He took office two years later.	Jupajj pä mara qhepatwa apnaqañ qalltäna.
He’s the one who has to go.	Jupaw sarañapa.
He was very curious about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal yatiñ munäna.
What you are saying is good.	Kuntï siskta ukajj wali askiwa.
The whole book.	Taqi uka libro.
It’s done a whole lot.	Ukax mä taqpach lurawayi.
He’s the one who made it.	Jupaw mä luratayna.
As much as it can be done.	Kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukhama.
in fact, now i am completely happy!!.	chiqansa, jichhax nayax taqpach kusisitaw jikxatastxa!!.
But then and then.	Ukampis ukat ukat ukat.
He wants to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa muni.
He’s a different person.	Jupax yaqha jaqiwa.
I don’t know what it is, really.	Janiw kunas uk yatkti, chiqpachansa.
But then you have to do it quickly.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw uk lurañama.
So do that, please.	Ukhamajj ukham luram.
That’s all he wanted to say.	Ukakiw ukham sañ munäna.
I need to do two things.	Nayax pä lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
And it had to be done.	Ukat ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
Years can take that long.	Maranakaw uka jaya tiempo munasispa.
I know you’re somewhere around here.	Nayax yattwa jumax kawkhans aka jak’an jikxatastaxa.
There was silence.	Ukanjja, amukiw jikjjatasïna.
It is what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna ukawa.
It came again.	Ukajj wasitatwa jutäna.
I think I’m very happy.	Nayax wali kusisitaw amuyta.
And really, that’s it.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax.
So you have this .	Ukhamajj jumajj aka .
We are a .	Jiwasax mä .
He didn't say anything.	Janiw kuns arskänti.
He told her what happened the night before.	Kunatï nayrïr arumax paskäna uk yatiyäna.
I think that should go to someone else.	Nayax amuyta ukax yaqha jaqiruw sarañapa.
Now it is very obvious.	Jichhajj wali qhanaw uñjasi.
It didn’t do very well.	Janiw sinti sum lurkänti.
Does this extend to everyone? 	¿Ukax taqiniruw puri?
It’s not that impossible.	Janiw ukham jan lurañjamäkiti.
And that’s the funny thing about it.	Ukat ukax wali muspharkañawa uka tuqitxa.
This is an important one.	Akax mä wakiskiriwa.
He called himself.	Jupa pachpaw jawsäna.
It’s not very useful.	Janiw sinti askïkiti.
I had no idea he could do that.	Ukham luraspa sasin janiw amuykayätti.
He said he couldn’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
I don't have time for that.	Ukatakejj janiw tiemponïkti.
I think he’s fine.	Nayax amuyta, jupax walikïskiwa.
I don't think it would be a problem for me.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis nayatak utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
That's the best thing that ever happened to him.	Ukajj kunatï jupar paskäna ukajj wali sumawa.
Maybe next time but certainly not necessary.	Inas jutïr kutin ukampis chiqpachansa janiw wakiskiti.
I don’t need it.	Nayax janiw wakiskiti.
And, of course, that’s it.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.
I really enjoy doing this.	Chiqpachansa aka lurañax nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
Now let’s do what you want us to do.	Jichhax kuntix jumax lurañ munkta uk lurañäni.
Let’s see now.	Jichhax uñjañäni.
But everything is fine.	Ukampis taqe kunas walikïskiwa.
You are an important person.	Jumax wali wakiskir jaqiwa.
I’m about this.	Nayax aka tuqitxa.
It was actually quite nice.	Chiqansa wali sumapunïnwa.
It needs to be done now.	Jichhax lurañaw wakisi.
He was crushing on her.	Jupajj jupar walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
Or a room.	Jan ukax mä cuarto.
I didn't say anything.	Nayajj janiw kuns siskti.
I understand the question.	Uka jisktʼajj sum amuyasta.
It happened ten years ago.	Tunka mara nayraw ukham pasäna.
Now you need to do something.	Jichhax mä lurañaw wakisi.
It will be a very long time.	Wali jaya tiempow utjani.
That’s weird, you think.	Ukax muspharkañawa, jumax amuyta.
He was better than she was.	Jupajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp suma jaqënwa.
He is a very good teacher.	Jupax wali suma yatichiriwa.
I needed a place.	Nayax mä chiqaw munasïna.
It would be nice to do as he said.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukham lurañajj wali askïspawa.
Of course, it never happens.	Chiqansa, janiw kunapachas ukhamäkiti.
But there’s one thing you can do, maybe you can.	Ukampis mä lurañaw utjaspa, inas jumax lurasma.
Of course, this is obvious.	Chiqansa, ukax qhanaw uñjasi.
He knew it well.	Uk sum yatïna.
Both of them are mine.	Panpachaniw nayax.
It’s such a pleasure.	Ukham kusiskañawa.
But there is room for improvement.	Ukampis jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
But let’s see how things stand.	Ukampis kunjamsa kunas utji uk uñjañäni.
A cold day.	Mä thaya uru.
There was never a time she wasn’t there for me.	Janiw kuna pachas jupax nayatakix jan utjkänti.
So it was here.	Ukhamaw akanx utjäna.
It happened to me.	Nayaruw ukham pasäna.
But he was faster.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
That surprised him.	Ukaw jupar muspharäna.
He decided to go out.	Jupaw mistuñ amtäna.
But he wasn't sure what that was.	Ukampis ukajj kunas uk janiw sum yatkänti.
And, somehow, it actually worked.	Ukat, kunjamatsa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But he was the worst.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp jan wali jaqënwa.
Nothing seems impossible.	Janiw kunas jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamäkiti.
It felt good, actually.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.
I don’t go very often.	Janiw sinti walja kuti sarkti.
Because it can’t be all there is to it.	Kunatix janiw ukax taqi kunas utjki ukax utjkaspati.
No one knows his real name.	Janiw khitis chiqpach sutip yatkiti.
You always need to do this.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham lurañax wakisi.
I think it’s very important.	Nayax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
In fact, he is trying to do too much.	Chiqansa, jupax sinti lurañatakiw chʼamachasiski.
You can do it alone.	Jumax sapakiw uk lurasma.
You can always do it a little faster.	Sapa kutiw mä juk’a jank’ak lurasma.
He didn't want to say anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
I didn't know exactly.	Janiw nayajj sum yatkayätti.
The point is, no one knows.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw khitis yatkiti.
He knew it all too well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uk yatïna.
He spoke again.	Jupax wasitatwa arsüna.
Good, good, good.	Suma, suma, suma.
We don't need to be too negative.	Jiwasajj janiw sinti jan walinak lurañajj wakiskiti.
I didn’t want to come.	Janiw nayax jutañ munkayätti.
That doesn't matter to me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskiti.
Who would you like to talk to? 	¿Khitimpis parlañ munasma?
He never did that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurkänti.
Of course, that's not right.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw walïkiti.
What matters is the content.	Kunatï wakiski ukajj kunatï ukan utjki ukawa.
But I don't know how.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
I hope to be half human.	Nayax chikat jaqir tukuñ suyt’askta.
It’s a very exciting day.	Uka urux wali kusiskañawa.
Do this as many times as you want.	Kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam walja kutiw ukham lurañama.
They are very important.	Jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
I don’t think that’s entirely true.	Nayax janiw ukax taqpach chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
I don't really know what he's doing.	Kuntï jupajj luraski uk janiw sum yatkti.
The same is not necessary.	Uka pachpajj janiw wakiskiti.
What could be inside.	Kunas uka manqhan utjaspa.
And the other, too, now.	Ukat maynix, ukhamarakiw jichhax.
Above all, water.	Taqi kunat sipansa, uma.
This can last for a few moments or hours.	Ukajj mä qhawqha tiempo jan ukajj walja horanakaw utjaspa.
I know we will.	Nayax yattwa, jiwasax ukham lurañäni.
I love the morning.	Nayax alwax walpun munasta.
It was a wonderful time.	Uka pachax wali sumapunïnwa.
How it turns out is beyond me.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkti.
Now tell me what you know.	Jichhajj kuntï yatkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
That feels really good to me.	Ukax nayatakix chiqpachans wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Money is one of them.	Qullqix ukanakat maynïriwa.
He saw more of her.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jupar uñjäna.
This could be you.	Akax jumaw utjaspa.
I mean it’s huge.	Nayax jach’a jach’a sañ munta.
So I'm not sure what's going to happen.	Ukhamajj kunas ukajj pasani uk janiw sum yatkti.
If I ever want to give, give, give.	Nayax kunapachas churañ munta, churañ munta, churañ munta.
He took his work seriously.	Jupajj lurañap wali askit uñjäna.
And you don’t want to do that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukham lurañ munktati.
You have to do something for me.	Jumax nayatakix kuns lurañamawa.
You, if necessary.	Jumax, wakisispa ukhaxa.
But that is rare.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti utjkiti.
The question was immediate.	Uka jisktʼajj jankʼakiw utjäna.
Somehow, he knew.	Kunjamatsa, jupax yatïna.
Just do whatever you can.	Ukhamajj kunatï lurañjamäki ukanak lurañamawa.
Only two, no more.	Pä sapakiw, janiw juk’ampi.
He loves to talk.	Parlañ wal muni.
He does it all the time, she tells him.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham luraski, sasaw juparux säna.
This is definitely one of them.	Chiqpachansa akax ukanakat maynïriwa.
These are the things we need to do.	Ukanakaw lurañasa.
But he could do both.	Ukampis jupajj panpachaniw luraspäna.
Of course you are a very nice person.	Chiqansa jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
He looked serious.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw uñnaqäna.
The trip takes about an hour.	Uka sarañatakix niya mä horaw munasispa.
So he gets to work.	Ukatwa irnaqäwir puri.
This was unusual at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, ukham lurañajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
And the snowflakes.	Ukat uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
It obviously worked.	Ukax qhanaw irnaqäna.
He was very cautious when he arrived here last.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw aka cheqar qhep qhepa purinïna.
Who knew for how long.	Khitis qhawqha tiempos uk yatïna.
Honestly, he wondered the same thing.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamarakiw jisktʼasïna.
These are difficult to do.	Ukanak lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
He could, he told himself.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
He had seen the words before.	Jupajj nayraw uka arunak uñjäna.
Another little word.	Yaqha jisk’a aru.
Bigger and better.	Jach’a ukat juk’amp suma.
Now, tell us.	Jichhax, yatiyapxita.
He gave me a cigarette.	Jupajj mä cigarro churitu.
In one respect he was.	Mä tuqitxa jupax ukhamänwa.
Everything would be good.	Taqi kunas wali askïspawa.
He didn’t care, really.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkänti, chiqpachansa.
Almost no one does.	Niya janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
It really got to me.	Chiqpachansa ukax nayaruw puri.
I am an adult myself.	Naya pachpaw mä jilïr jaqïtwa.
An eye-catching.	Mä nayra.
You need to do this at least once.	Mä kutis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
And it’s still better than nothing.	Ukat wali sumaw jan kunat sipansa.
He didn't really want to do that.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukham lurañ munkänti.
He knew that was unnecessary.	Jupajj ukajj janiw wakiskänti uk sum yatïna.
The rain began to fall heavily.	Jallux wali ch’amampiw puriñ qalltäna.
It could not ride.	Ukajj janiw kayuk sarañ puedkänti.
I think he would have done that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukham luraspänwa.
He lay in bed for half an hour.	Chika horaw ikiñan ikiskäna.
I really didn’t expect this to happen.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurasiñap suykayätti.
I’m not sure how you feel about it.	Nayax janiw kunjams jumax amuyta ukx yatkti.
He turned back again.	Jupajj wasitatwa kuttʼjjäna.
This is cooler and better.	Akax wali thaya ukat juk’amp askiwa.
After the storm.	Uka thaya qhepatjja.
Now he knew that wouldn't happen.	Jichhajj janiw ukham pasañap yatïna.
He has no idea what that will cost.	Ukajj kuna qollqsa munasini uk janiw jupajj amuykiti.
You need time.	Jumax tiempow munasispa.
He’s excited about it.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
When you don't want to.	Kunapachatï jan munkta ukhajja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He sat down on it.	Jupajj ukaruw qontʼasïna.
It doesn’t matter anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans ukax kunäkisa.
He wanted to talk immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw parltʼañ munäna.
He said he couldn’t believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
It is better than nothing.	Ukajj jan kunas utjki ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
I really don’t like that.	Chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix janiw askïkiti.
And he loved it so much.	Ukat jupajj walpun munasïna.
A day or two.	Mä uru jan ukax pä uru.
Well, that wasn't his thing.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj jupatak utjkänti.
But when he did it, he did everything.	Ukampis uk lurkäna ukhajja, taqe kunwa luräna.
I will not do that here.	Nayajj janiw akan ukham lurkäti.
I didn’t know where to go from there.	Uka chiqat kawkirus sarañax janiw yatkayätti.
I just don’t know how.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa uk yatkti.
Everyone knows what is wrong.	Taqinipuniw kunanakas jan walïki uk yatipxi.
Let me know how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk yatiyapjjeta.
There was a light there, too.	Ukanx mä qhanaw utjäna, ukhamaraki.
I understand exactly what it is.	Kunas uk sum amuyasta.
It doesn’t matter, of course.	Janiw ukax wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
A little bit of a snowflake.	Mä juk’a ch’uqi.
He sat in silence.	Jupajj amukiw qontʼasïna.
He was the one who knew how to do things well.	Jupaw kunanaktï lurañ munkäna ukanak sum lurañ yatïna.
He saw it happening.	Ukham luraskäna uk jupaw uñjäna.
These were actually really good.	Ukanakax chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
He took out the money.	Jupajj qollqe apsüna.
I never knew what it was.	Janipuniw kunas uk yatkayätti.
One day like that.	Mä uru ukham.
You don't care about the facts.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw jumatak wakiskiti.

He said that was fine.	Jupajj ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.

Well, he doesn’t matter.	Ukhama, jupax janiw kunäkisa.
He certainly doesn’t.	Jupax chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkiti.
It doesn’t mean anything to you.	Janiw jumatakix kuns sañ munkiti.
So that is very important.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
I didn’t want to leave them.	Janiw jupanakar jaytañ munkayätti.
But that doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis nayatakejj ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I haven't seen him in a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw jupar uñjkti.
He found out too late.	Jupajj wali qhepatwa uk yatïna.
No one quite understood what was happening here.	Kunatï akan paskäna uk janiw khitis sum amuykänti.
He wants to make a decision.	Jupax mä amtar puriñ muni.
He rolled his eyes but said nothing.	Jupax nayranakap ch’allxtayäna ukampis janiw kuns arskänti.
He did the impossible.	Jupax jan lurañjamäki uk luratayna.
The food is okay.	Manq’añax walikïskiwa.
And this is the difficulty.	Ukat akax ch’amawa.
For a long time.	Walja tiempo.
Made a snowflake.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi luratayna.
Or maybe two.	Jan ukajj inas pä.
He looked just as he always did.	Jupajj kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhamarakiw uñnaqäna.
He’s very quiet right now.	Jupax jichhax wali amukiw jikxatasi.
I don't know how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw yatkti.
There is nothing that can be done.	Janiw kunas lurkaspati.
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.	Inas jichha arumax jan ukax qharüru.
It’s very familiar to me.	Nayatakix wali uñt’atawa.
I never wanted to know about it.	Janipuniw nayajj uka toqet yatiñ munkayätti.
I thought he knew what we were doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk jupajj sum yati sasaw amuyayäta.
But he can act quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw kuns luraspa.
It’s always a little bit more.	Sapa kutiw mä juk’a juk’ampi.

He was that little kind of person.	Jupajj uka jiskʼa kasta jaqënwa.
I did what he did.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk lurayäta.
He would, as there is an opportunity.	Jupax luraspänwa, kunjamtï mä oportunidad utjki ukhaxa.
I definitely want to buy more.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw juk’amp alañ munta.
Whether it’s true or not doesn’t really matter.	Chiqpachansa janicha ukax janiw chiqpachapunix wakiskiti.

But the thing is, this is hard.	Ukampis kunatix utjki ukax, akax ch’amawa.
No, he said, 'It's not.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj säna.

You know he doesn’t.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.

About what is going on right now, they just don't know.	Kunatï jichhajj utjki uka toqetwa, janiw yatipkiti.

I think less is more.	Nayax juk’akiw juk’ampi sasaw amuyta.
I’m nobody like that.	Nayax janiw khitis ukhamäkti.
He knew what he had to do.	Kun lurañas wakisispa uk sum yatïna.

But what happened was wonderful.	Ukampis kunatï paskäna ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.

No, he doesn’t know her name.	Janiwa, jupax janiw sutip yatkiti.
I don’t mean never.	Nayax janiw kunapachas sañ munkti.

He scares you.	Jupax jumaruw axsarayi.
What’s going on?.	¿Kunas pasaski?.
He lives nearby.	Uka jak’an jakasi.
No one wants to play with him.	Janiw khitis jupamp anattʼañ munkiti.
But it didn't mean that.	Ukampis janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
No one knows what he looked like.	Kunjamsa uñnaqäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Exactly, as you can imagine.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhama.
No one knew much about him.	Janiw khitis jupat wal yatkänti.
You never know what could happen.	Kunas utjaspa uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
Now this is really interesting.	Jichhax akax chiqpachans wali askiwa.
It is very clear what is happening.	Kunas pasaski ukajj wali qhanawa.

At the time, I thought that was the right thing to do.	Uka tiemponjja, ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
He didn't know what she thought of him.	Jupajj kunsa jupat amuyäna uk janiw yatkänti.
I don’t remember it.	Nayax janiw amtaskti.
Let’s see where I’m actually doing the work.	Kawkhantï cheqpachapun lurañanak luraskta uk uñjañäni.
He says he wants out.	Jupax mistuñ munta sasaw saraki.
And it’s nothing like that.	Ukat janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
I really don’t get this.	Chiqpachansa janiw akax jikxatkti.
But there was nothing for it.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw kunas utjkänti.
I’m totally happy with it.	Nayax taqpach kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

He says he doesn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkti sasaw saraki.
Then he drove away.	Ukat autot sarxäna.
So much money.	Ukhama walja qullqi.
He is a rich man.	Jupajj qamir jaqewa.

Never at all.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa.

But that doesn't matter to me .	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa .
And then he didn't.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw ukham lurkänti.
He really, really said that.	Jupax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukham sänwa.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
But he knew the truth.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I didn’t do everything.	Janiw taqi kuns lurkti.
That looks pretty hard right now.	Ukax jichhax wali ch’amaw uñtasi.
I don’t think it’s possible.	Nayatakix janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He was comfortable here.	Jupajj akan sum jikjjatasïna.
You can do it alone, really.	Jumax sapakiw lurasma, chiqpachapuniw.
Tell me what to do.	Kun lurañas uk yatiyapxita.
It just worked that way.	Ukajj ukhamakiw irnaqäna.
I see what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk uñjta.
I don't know exactly what happened there.	Ukan kunas pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I didn't know what to do.	Nayajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
He’s got a problem.	Jupax mä jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
Now they’re good enough.	Jichhax jupanakax wali askiwa.
I think he felt bad about it, too.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uka tuqitx jan waliw jikxatasïna, ukhamaraki.
You really understand.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw amuyasta.
I told him that was wrong.	Ukajj janiw walïkiti sasaw sista.
He was a very loving character.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw sarnaqäna.
He was a tall, imposing man.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqënwa, wali jachʼa jaqënwa.
I don’t want to go there.	Nayax janiw uka chiqar sarañ munkti.
It’s been like this for a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw ukham jikxatasïna.
I don’t ever want to do that.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurañ munkti.
He should do so then.	Jupajj ukhaw ukham lurañapa.
But I don't know exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkti.
He looked so small and alone there.	Jupax wali jisk’a ukat sapakiw ukan uñnaqäna.
I actually thought it was pretty cool.	Chiqansa, wali sumaw sasaw amuyayäta.
But he wasn't quite sure.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sum amuyaskänti.
Things were very quiet.	Kunanakas wali amukiw utjäna.
I’ve always loved it.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukax walpun munasta.
No one knows what he is doing.	Janiw khitis kuntï luraski uk yatkiti.
I was really shocked.	Chiqpachansa nayax walpun muspharta.
And really, it was for me.	Ukat chiqpachansa, nayatakix ukhamänwa.
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Nayax janiw kunas jan walïki uk yatkti.
I understand it.	Nayax amuyasta.
It doesn’t, of course.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
But so far, pretty good.	Ukampis jichhakamax, wali sumawa.
But that is still a bad thing.	Ukampis ukajj jan walikïskiwa.
I’m almost certainly saying from that distance.	Nayax niya chiqpachapuniw uka jaya chiqat sista.
He’s never without it.	Jupax janipuniw jan ukax utjkiti.
But all of this happened later.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj qhepatwa pasäna.
He knew what he was doing that night.	Kuntï uka arumax luraskäna uk sum yatïna.
I don’t know where he got it.	Janiw kawkitsa apsüna uk yatkti.
I want to drive away.	Nayax autot sarxañ munta.
He can finally be himself.	Jupajj qhepatjja jupa pachpaw utjaspa.
Somehow he knew that.	Kunjamatsa jupax uk yatïna.
I appreciate him very much.	Jupajj wali askit uñjta.
I don’t know what to do.	Janiw kunsa yatkti.
New people every night, every week, and more.	Machaq jaqinakax sapa arumaw, sapa semana, ukat juk’ampi.
So it almost never happens.	Ukhamajj niya janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
I mean that with caution.	Nayax ukax wali amuyumpiw sañ munta.
Or you can do both.	Jan ukajj panpachaniw lurasma.
He doesn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns yatkiti.
Maybe you should do the same.	Inas jumax ukham lurañax wakischispa.
I enjoyed my last meal.	Qhipa manq’añax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
And not financially.	Ukat janiw qullqi tuqitxa.
And where is it, of course.	Ukat kawkhansa utji, chiqpachansa.
He was happy, too happy.	Jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna, sinti kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I wasn't sure what had just happened.	Kunatï jichhak paskäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
I don't know what he saw.	Janiw nayajj kuntï jupajj uñjkta uk yatkti.
I think that is a good thing.	Ukajj wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
He would never have done that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurkaspänti.
He was intrigued by it.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun muspharäna.
A nice breeze.	Mä suma thaya.
He decided to be alone.	Jupajj sapakiw sarnaqañ amtäna.
I don’t want to use anything at all.	Janiw kunatsa kuns apnaqañ munkti.
So there is no one person.	Ukhamajj janiw mä jaqejj utjkiti.
How was the trio.	Kunjamsa uka kimsa jaqejj utjäna.
That is especially true here.	Ukajj jukʼampiw aka cheqan utji.
A little while ago.	Mä juk’a pachax nayrax.
He’s a good guy.	Jupax suma jaqiwa.
Something important happened here.	Mä wakiskir kunaw akan pasäna.
And also this world is flat.	Ukat ukhamaraki aka pachax ch’uqi ch’uqi satawa.
But very bad, terribly bad.	Ukampis wali jan wali, wali axsarkañ jan wali.
He didn't know exactly how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
And that meant this.	Ukat ukajj akham sañ munäna.
That's what he did.	Ukajj jupajj luräna.
Let's see how well that feels.	Ukajj kunjamsa sum jikjjatasi uk uñjañäni.
And he could never do that.	Ukat janipuniw ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
He was sleeping with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw ikiskäna.
This was not the first time.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr kutis ukhamäkänti.
And he wanted to do it.	Ukat uk lurañwa munäna.
But it doesn't matter today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw kunäkisa.
He, like that.	Jupax, ukhama.
That happened later.	Ukajj qhepatwa pasäna.
So don't do that to yourself.	Ukhamajj janiw juma pachpajj ukham lurañamäkiti.
This is believed not to be the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
Today of course.	Jichhürunakanxa chiqpachansa.
I like to do it.	Nayax lurañax wali askiwa.
He gave me the opportunity.	Jupaw uka oportunidad churitu.
I don’t want to be without you.	Janiw jumamp jan sarnaqañ munkti.
But he didn't want that to happen tonight.	Ukampis janiw jichha arumax ukham lurasiñap munkänti.
Not much in any way.	Janiw kuna tuqitsa sinti.
That’s all good though.	Ukax taqpach wali askiwa ukampis.
I know he did that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luratayna.
I want to know how to do it.	Kunjamsa uk lurañ yatiñ munta.
I think that’s exciting, too.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali kusiskañawa, ukhamaraki.
But it’s very rare these days.	Ukampis aka urunakanx wali juk’akiw utji.
It really looks like that.	Chiqpachansa ukham uñtatawa.
They were like that.	Jupanakajj ukhamänwa.
I didn’t think I could do that for you.	Nayax janiw jumatakix ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyirïkti.
He needs our help too.	Jupajj jiwasan yanaptʼa munaraki.
Of course, it doesn't.	Chiqansa, janiw ukanak lurkiti.
There he goes again.	Ukaruw wasitat sarxi.
That takes me a long time.	Ukax nayatakix wali jaya pachaw munasispa.
He just feels like that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasi.
I never really liked him.	Janipuniw jupajj cheqpachapun gustkituti.
But that doesn't work.	Ukampis ukajj janiw irnaqkiti.
She looks amazing.	Jupax muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
You always do that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham lurasma.
A young man.	Mä waynax.
So far he’s done that.	Jichhakamax jupax ukham lurawayi.
I am not sure if you knew that.	Uk yatkayätati janicha uk janiw sum yatkti.
Not just recently.	Janiw jichhak ukhamäkiti.
But it's okay about that.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa walikïskiwa.
It’s what you need to do.	Ukax kuntix lurañax wakiski ukawa.
For a year he lay in bed alone.	Mä mara sapakiw ikiñan ikiskäna.
Rather, he knows what is wrong.	Jan ukasti kunatï sinti jan walïki uk yati.
And this guy loved her.	Ukat aka waynax juparux walpun munasïna.
He has to do something.	Jupaw kuns lurañapa.
I had never thought of it that way before.	Nayrajj janiw ukham amuyirïkti.
I did what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk lurayäta.
I don’t want to go anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ munkti.
I want to make sure of that.	Nayax uk sum uñjañ munta.
I made some lunch.	Nayax mä juk’a chika uru manq’añanak lurawayta.
How cool is that?.	¿Kunjamsa ukajj wali thaya?.
No one spoke, didn’t know what was going on.	Janiw khitis arskänti, janiw kunas paskäna uk yatkänti.
I see where the people are.	Kawkhantï jaqenakajj utjki uk uñjta.
It doesn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkiti.
It felt like that.	Ukajj ukham amuyasïna.

It is much better to do so.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
Of course it doesn’t matter.	Chiqansa janiw ukax wakiskiti.
Twice too many.	Pä kuti sinti walja.
I never knew about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet yatkayätti.
They were so nice.	Ukhama wali suma.
But he was busy.	Ukampis jupax jan tiemponiw jikxatasïna.
You definitely don’t want it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw jan munktati.
Nothing he didn't know about it.	Janiw kunas jupajj uka toqet jan yatkänti.
It’s all fun and fascinating.	Taqi kunas kusiskañawa ukat wali muspharkañawa.
No, you never want to do that.	Janiwa, jumax janipuniw ukham lurañ munktati.
The next thing is very difficult.	Jutïr kunas wali ch’amawa.
He was very nice and friendly.	Jupajj wali suma ukat wali suma jaqënwa.

I can’t really do it.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix lurirjamäkti.

I don’t want to say anything.	Janiw kuns sañ munkti.
They know this and so do you.	Jupanakax uk yatipxi ukat jumanakax ukhamarakiw yatipxi.
He will do it with pleasure.	Jupajj kusisitaw uk lurani.
So far so good, though.	Jichhakamax wali sumawa, ukampis.
You don’t have to do this alone.	Janiw jumanakax sapak uk lurañax wakiskiti.
Such a nice surprise!.	¡Ukham suma muspharkañawa!.
And it was all really good.	Ukat chiqpachansa taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.

I don’t know if that’s what it is or what it could be.	Ukax kunas jan ukax kunas utjaspa uk janiw yatkti.
This was the case.	Akax ukhamänwa.
I agree with what he said.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
There was a lot of work to be done.	Walja lurañaw wakisïna.
Not really that much.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
I was surprised myself.	Naya pachpaw wal muspharta.
Something heavy, but sleeping.	Kunas wali jach’a, ukampis ikiskäna.
Doesn't mean it's a bad thing though.	Janiw ukax jan wali sañ munkiti ukampis.
He goes to bed.	Jupax ikiñar sarxi.
And he looked at them.	Ukat jupanakar uñjäna.

It was good, really good.	Wali sumapunïnwa, chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
What do you like and why do you like it.	Kunas jumatakix wali askïspa ukat kunatsa jumatakix wali askïspa.

Now I will do the same.	Jichhajj nayajj ukhamarakiw lurä.
Thank you very much.	Walpun walpun yuspärta.
I didn’t tell him why.	Kunatsa uk janiw jupar siskti.

So what are you waiting for ??.	Ukhamajj kunsa suyaskta ??.
So maybe we should.	Ukhamajj inas jiwasajj ukham lurañasa.
That's even better.	Ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
He refused to get involved.	Jupajj janiw ukar mantañ munkänti.
So it was immediate.	Ukhamajj jankʼakiw utjäna.
I don’t know exactly what it is.	Janiw kunas uk sum yatkti.
Do it or ever do it.	Lurañamawa jan ukax kunapachas lurañamawa.

Now I say that to myself.	Jichhajj naya pachpaw ukham sista.
I’ve been here for a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw akanktxa.
He said he was going to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa saraskta sasaw säna.
So the reason for this was definitely not financial.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukajj cheqpachapun janiw qollqe toqet utjkänti.
She asked him what he said.	Jupajj kunsa säna uk jisktʼäna.
I only did it once.	Mä kutikiw uk lurawayta.
That's what you know.	Ukajj jumajj yatisktawa.
I don’t think so.	Nayax janiw ukham amuyta.
But no one had ever said that to them before.	Ukampis janiw khitis nayrajj ukham jupanakar arskänti.
All or nothing here.	Taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
I can do it sooner rather than later.	Nayax jankʼakiw uk lurasmati.
It takes a little more time.	Mä jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
But that happened yesterday.	Ukampis ukajj qharüruw pasäna.
You really don’t have to do anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurañas wakiskiti.
I’m sorry, but that’s how it works.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
And you don’t have to do that.	Ukat janiw ukanak lurañax wakiskiti.
He goes there twice a day.	Jupax urux pä kutiw ukar sarxi.
I’ve seen them first hand.	Nayax jupanakar nayraqat uñjta.
I don’t want anything to do with him.	Janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkti.

You used to be like that.	Jumax nayrax ukhamänwa.
He’s a very popular guy.	Jupax wali uñt’at waynawa.

He wanted to go in again.	Jupax wasitat mantañ munäna.
No, he didn't know for sure.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw sum yatkänti.
He doesn't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkiti.
That can’t happen to you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix utjkaspati.

I didn’t expect one.	Janiw mä suykayätti.
He was so happy to see her.	Jupar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think it’s worth it.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali askiwa.
Do what you can for her.	Kuntï jupatak lurañjamäki uk luram.
But, as it stands, I have only myself.	Ukampis, kunjamtï utjki ukhama, naya sapakiw utjitu.

I think, maybe.	Nayax amuyta, inas.
I don’t think you can do that.	Nayax janiw jumax ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyta.

It’s funny, it’s cool.	Wali muspharkañawa, wali ch’amawa.
He wanted something.	Jupajj kunsa munäna.
But we are just like that.	Ukampis jiwasajj ukhamakiw.
Now he finally knew what he had to do.	Jichhajj qhepatjja, kunsa lurañapa uk sumwa amuyasïna.
I want to work on some of these.	Ukanakat mä juk’a irnaqañ munta.
Eventually, she wondered why.	Qhepatjja, kunatsa ukham lurawayta sasaw jisktʼasïna.
No one could have done anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkaspänti.
It came with a lot of energy.	Wali ch’amampiw jutäna.
So I don't believe that's going to happen.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak pasañap creykti.
It’s been fun for a while.	Mä juk’a pachax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He was watching it intently.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
I think he means it this time.	Nayax amuyta, jupax aka kutix ukham sañ muni.
He didn't know where or how to do it.	Jupajj janiw kawkinsa ni kunjamsa uk lurañsa yatkänti.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ukjja nayajj yattwa.
Now, that seems unlikely.	Jichhax, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasi.
He wants to know who he is.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk yatiñwa muni.
There it was right there.	Ukanx chiqpachapuniw utjäna.
You know what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
You know, you shouldn’t do that.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.
Let’s do it in the morning.	Alwat lurañäni.
And that’s never the case.	Ukat ukax janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
They don't need to do that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
She wondered how he was feeling, and what he was doing.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi, ukat kunsa luraski sasaw jisktʼasïna.
So let’s see what happens’.	Ukhamajj kunas pasani uk uñjañäni’.
I understand that perfectly.	Nayajj uk sum amuyta.
We've got that.	Jiwasax ukaruw uka...
He decided that he never really liked them.	Jupajj janipuniw jupanakar cheqpachapun gustkituti sasaw amtäna.
That morning was a happy one.	Uka alwajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
It was a beautiful, quiet time.	Uka tiempojj wali suma, amukiw utjäna.
And still.	Ukat wali.
He did not know his real name.	Jupajj janiw cheqpach sutip yatkänti.

And he began.	Ukat jupajj qalltäna.
Away from home.	Utapat jaya.
We have it every day.	Jiwasax sapa uruw ukax utjistu.
I think that speaks for itself!.	Nayax amuyta ukax jupa pachpaw arsu!.
He sat down with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw qontʼasïna.
No one knew why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
But he came along.	Ukampis jupajj jutäna.
I started researching it.	Nayax uka tuqit yatxatañ qalltawayta.
And maybe.	Ukat inas.
He knows this all too well.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali sum yati.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasïna.
Thank you so much for all of this.	Taqe ukanakat walpun yuspärta.
Not that he isn't.	Janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
So you have to do that.	Ukhamajj jumajj ukham lurañamawa.
I want him here with me.	Nayax juparux akan nayamp chikaw munta.
He doesn't do too much wrong.	Jupajj janiw sinti jan walinak lurkiti.
He had just left.	Jupajj jichhakiw sarjjäna.
I think that’s a little bit about him.	Nayax jupat mä juk’a ukham amuyta.
I want to do my own thing.	Naya pachpaw lurañanak lurañ munta.
A new wine.	Mä machaq vino.
You must never give up.	Janipuniw jaytañamäkiti.
Too bad he couldn’t talk.	Sinti jan waliw jupax janiw parlañ puedkänti.
He never did and never did.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti ukat janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I just decided to join.	Jichhakiw ukar mantañ amtawayta.
I didn’t do it very well.	Janiw sinti sum lurkti.
I’ve seen them myself.	Naya pachpaw jupanakar uñjta.
He preached a lot about it.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun yatiyäna.
He wanted it, he wanted it.	Jupax munäna, jupax munäna.
At that point, things could be better.	Uka tiemponjja, kunas jukʼamp askïspawa.
That was something I didn't expect.	Ukajj janiw suykayätti.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurkäna uk yatkänti.
He doesn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkiti.
Then he called the police.	Ukat policiaruw jawsäna.
I want some time to myself.	Naya pachpaw mä jukʼa tiempo munta.
But yeah, he's barely there.	Ukampis jïsa, jupax jukʼakiw ukan utji.

He was determined not to.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jan ukham lurañ amtäna.

He called out to her.	Jupajj sasaw jawsäna.
He really likes you, you know.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw jumarux gusti, jumax yatisktawa.
You are, after all, the reason we exist!.	¡Jumax, taqi kunat sipansa, kunatsa jiwasax utjistu!.
There is nothing wrong with the two.	Uka pä tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I have no problem whatsoever.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
I don’t like them.	Janiw jupanakar gustkituti.
But it is difficult to do wrong.	Ukampis jan walinak lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
But that is not the case with these things.	Ukampis ukanak lurañ tuqitxa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that would be worth it.	Ukampis ukajj wali askïspawa.
This is not something that can be done.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I said don't do it.	Nayajj janiw uk luramti sasaw sista.
This is not impossible.	Ukax janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.

There was power here, yes, he felt it.	Aka chiqanx ch’amaw utjäna, jïsa, jupax ukham jikxatasïna.
This is especially true of sleep.	Ukax jukʼampiw ikiñ tuqitxa.
Let’s take a closer look at how he does it.	Kunjamsa jupax uk luraski uk sum uñjañäni.
Very bad surprise.	Wali jan wali muspharkañawa.
He said he didn’t do it.	Janiw uk lurkti sasaw säna.
You tell me who did it.	Jumax khitis uk luratayna uk yatiyapxita.
More than twenty.	Juk’ampi pä tunka.
So he thought it was great.	Ukatwa jupajj wali jachʼa ukham amuyäna.
That's what he was.	Ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
These are the things he has done.	Ukanak jupajj lurawayi.

But what can happen!.	Ukampis ¡kunas pasaspa!.
I knew it wasn't really.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkänti uk sum yatiyäta.

And then he started coming.	Ukat ukat jupax jutañ qalltäna.
So that's what it is.	Ukhamajj ukajj ukhamawa.
No one said how he could do it.	Kunjamsa uk luraspa uk janiw khitis siskänti.
I feel a little sad.	Mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasta.
It doesn’t work like that.	Janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.	Ukat taqi chuymaw yuspärta.
It would make him who he was.	Ukaw khitïnsa uk luraspäna.
I don’t know what happened to me.	Kunas nayar pasäna uk janiw yatkti.
If necessary.	Ukax wakisispa ukhaxa.
About two days.	Niya pä uru.
But a little bit.	Ukampis mä jukʼa.
I have no idea where that came from.	Ukajj kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw amuykti.
I don’t do that, I never will.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti, janipuniw ukham lurkäti.
If he does, all the better.	Jupajj ukham luraski ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
He really doesn’t like it.	Chiqpachansa janiw juparux gustkiti.
Of course, the coffee was excellent.	Chiqansa, café ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
As it is required.	Kunjamtï wakiski ukhama.
It’s a very high-profile.	Wali jach’a uñt’atawa.
I don’t want to give it to anyone.	Janiw khitirus churañ munkti.
He doesn’t want to say it again.	Jupax janiw mayamp arsuñ munkiti.
But I understand what you mean.	Ukampis kuntï sañ munkta uk sum amuyta.
I just want one.	Nayajj mä sapakiw munta.
Well, that’s what he did.	Ukhama, ukax jupaw luratayna.
Or so he says he thinks.	Jan ukajj ukham amuyta sasaw saraki.
We have hours to go.	Walja horanakaw sarañax utjistu.
So he is doing great on his own.	Ukhamajj jupa pachpaw wali sum luraski.
I need to do it right.	Nayax chiqapar lurañaw wakisi.
It’s been tough this year.	Jichha marax wali ch’amawa.
Longer, if necessary.	Juk’ampi jaya, wakisispa ukhaxa.
But someone will do it.	Ukampis mayniw uk lurani.
It was with me.	Nayamp chikaw utjäna.
I am not sure about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw sum yatkti.
I need time.	Nayax tiempow munasispa.
Kind of pretty big.	Mä juk’a suma jach’a.
It is either with you or without you.	Ukajj jumamp jan ukajj jan jumamp chikaw utji.
It cannot be in the morning.	Janiw alwajj utjkaspati.

But what could he do? 	Ukampis ¿kunsa jupajj luraspäna?
He knows what he did to me.	Kuntï nayar lurkäna uk sum yati.
He didn't do very well.	Jupajj janiw sinti sum lurkänti.
He will do so.	Ukham lurani.
And he kind of gets to it.	Ukat jupax mä juk’a ukaruw puri.
I don't know how he does it.	Kunjamsa uk luri uk janiw yatkti.
I asked him what he was doing.	Kunsa jupajj luraski sasaw jisktʼta.
I don’t know what, but it’s okay.	Janiw kuns yatkti, ukampis walikïskiwa.
I mean this time.	Nayax aka kutix ukham sañ munta.
Never do this again.	Janipuniw mayampsa uk lurañamäkiti.
He knew he was real.	Jupajj cheqpach jaqëtap sum yatïna.
All of this needs to be done properly.	Taqi ukanak sum lurañaw wakisi.
He really wanted to talk to me.	Jupajj walpun nayamp parltʼañ munäna.
But maybe you need a little help.	Ukampis inas mä jukʼa yanaptʼa wakischispa.
It just means what it says.	Kuntï siski ukhamakiw sañ muni.
I never wanted to be a good guy.	Janipuniw mä suma chachar tukuñ munkti.
That’s what he decided to do.	Ukham lurañaw sasaw amtäna.
It means talking.	Ukajj parlañ sañ muni.
He is the .	Jupajj uka .
I’m sure it will be night.	Nayax arumaw utjani sasaw amuyasta.
No more and no more.	Janiw juk’ampi ukat juk’ampi.
I wasn’t, he said.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkti, sasaw säna.
I think you understand me.	Nayax amuyta jumax nayar amuyasta.
I don't know what exactly it is about.	Kunas chiqpachapunix uka tuqitxa janiw yatkti.
Old school, but effective.	Nayra yatiqañ uta, ukampis wali askiwa.
So he came to the hospital.	Ukatwa hospitalar jutäna.
I can’t stand it.	Janiw uk aguantañjamäkiti.
I want to get to work.	Nayax irnaqäwir mantañ munta.
Nothing all the time.	Janiw kunas sapa kuti.
I think he did that.	Jupajj ukham luratayna sasaw amuyta.
He said it had happened before.	Jupajj nayraw ukham pasäna sasaw säna.
It was a painful experience.	Ukajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
It feels like that every day.	Sapa uruw ukham amuyasi.
A lot of times it doesn’t go well.	Walja kutix janiw sum sarkiti.
And I don’t get that.	Ukat nayax janiw uk jikxatkti.
I wish I could do that as soon as possible.	Nayax jank’akiw ukham lurañax munta.
He had done something wrong.	Jupajj jan walinak luratayna.
I said no, but he didn't.	Nayajj janiw sasaw sista, ukampis janiw siskänti.
I say, now, it is.	Nayax siwa, jichhax, ukhamawa.
It was, in the past.	Ukhamänwa, nayra tiemponjja.
There, he thought.	Ukanjja, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Any way really.	Kawkïr tuqitsa chiqpachansa.
So there is no reason.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
He seemed much older.	Jupajj jukʼamp jilïr jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s not big and not small.	Janiw jach’a ukat jan jisk’a ukhamäkiti.
But he doesn’t want to give up.	Ukampis janiw jaytañ munkiti.
You know a great deal, by the way.	Jumax wali jach’a yatisktawa, ukhamawa.
More or less.	Mä juk’a jan ukax juk’ampi.
Of course, everyone needs to do that.	Chiqansa sapa mayniw ukham lurañax wakisi.
But he soon found out.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk yatïna.
There was no one.	Janiw khitis utjkänti.
Everything is really awesome in the area.	Chiqpachansa taqi kunas uka chiqanx wali muspharkañawa.
But it never really works well.	Ukampis janipuniw chiqpachansa sum irnaqkiti.
I don’t know who this person is.	Janiw khitis aka jaqix uk yatkti.
What happened is amazing.	Kunatï paskäna ukajj muspharkañawa.
But he didn't say all of that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kuns siskänti.
I think it was a one-off.	Ukajj mä kutikiw utjäna sasaw amuyta.
The same thing happened to us.	Jiwasajj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
Why, it doesn’t work.	Kunatsa, janiw irnaqkiti.
But you need half a day.	Ukampis chika uruw munasispa.
Means a lot, really good.	Walja sañ muni, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I think you can do this place.	Nayax amuyta, jumax aka chiqar lurasma.
It needs to be done better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisi.
It’s funny, he says.	Wali muspharkañawa, sasaw saraki.
But let’s see.	Ukampis uk uñjañäni.
I’ve never done that.	Nayax janipuniw ukham lurkti.
I’m not saying that.	Nayax janiw ukham siskti.
More or less.	Jila jan ukax juk’ampi.
I don't like doing things too fast these days.	Aka urunakanx janiw sinti jankʼak lurañax nayatakix askïkiti.
There was no one in him.	Janiw khitis jupan utjkänti.
But you did, too.	Ukampis jumajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
You’ve got that right.	Jumax ukax walikïskiwa.
Well just about.	Suma ukhamakiw niya.
I want to do something important and great.	Nayax mä wakiskir ukat jach’a lurañanak lurañ munta.
There was something about it.	Uka tuqitxa mä kunaw utjäna.
But now he knows better.	Ukampis jichhajj jukʼamp sum yati.
He was the perfect man for it.	Ukatakejj wali suma jaqënwa.
That’s what happens.	Ukhamaw pasaski.
Everything looks great.	Taqi kunas wali suma uñtatawa.
Or we'll do something else.	Jan ukajj yaqha toqetwa lurañäni.
One thing I am waiting for.	Mä kunaw suytʼaskta.
It’s funny because he doesn’t want to move.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa kunatix jupax janiw sarnaqañ munkiti.
It spoke very well.	Ukajj wali sum arsüna.
No, it's not.	Janiwa, jan ukasti.
He runs the job.	Jupaw uka irnaqäw apnaqi.
I have nothing to do with me.	Nayax janiw kuns nayamp lurkti.
I knew it would happen again.	Wasitat ukham lurasiñap yatiyätwa.
That's how he always felt.	Ukhamwa sapa kuti jikjjatasïna.
We’ll see how things go.	Kunjamsa kunas saraski uk uñjañäni.
That’s certainly not the case.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukax ukhamäkiti.
That’s what happened last week.	Ukhamaw pasïr semanan pasäna.
He didn’t know any other way.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit yatkänti.
And he really wants it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw uk muni.
He had no choice but to do nothing.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, jan ukasti janiw kuns lurkänti.
But he walked quickly.	Ukampis jupax jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
Honestly, it doesn’t really matter.	Chiqpachansa, janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.
Of course I don’t have any.	Chiqansa janiw nayan utjkituti.
He said it happened so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw pasäna sasaw säna.
I just don't have that.	Nayajj janiw ukajj utjkituti.
What do you think of the scene.	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyta.
He goes every year.	Jupax sapa maraw saraski.
I don’t see him doing that.	Janiw jupar ukham lurir uñjkti.
It’s either all-encompassing or all-encompassing.	Ukax taqpach uñt’atawa jan ukax taqpach uñt’atawa.
It will be this year.	Jichha maraw ukax utjani.
They don’t know how to work.	Jupanakax janiw irnaqañ yatipkiti.
And no way does that matter.	Ukat janiw kunjamatsa ukax kunäkisa.
He had just passed away.	Jupajj jichhakiw jiwjjäna.
I want the wind.	Nayax thaya munta.
And so it happened.	Ukat ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I’ll have to do more.	Nayax juk’amp lurañaw wakisini.
I immediately started using it at night before going to bed.	Janïr ikiñar sarkasajj arumaw jankʼak apnaqañ qalltawayta.
You can’t do anything for me.	Jumax janiw kuns nayatakix lurañjamäkiti.
I don’t know how to do enough about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit sum lurañ yatkti.
Who saw him last.	Khitis jupar qhip qhipa uñjäna.
Nothing more is needed than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
I’m very, very sad about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali, wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
This he did not like to do too often.	Ukajj janiw walja kuti lurañajj jupar gustkänti.
I didn't understand this for a long time.	Walja tiempow uk jan amuykayätti.
I was terrified of doing this.	Uk lurañajj wal ajjsarayäta.
She never knew who he was.	Jupajj janipuniw khitïnsa uk yatkänti.
So this was mine.	Ukhamaw akax nayatakix utjäna.
Not the brother again.	Janiw jilatajj mayampsa.
Like you do everything.	Kunjamtï jumax taqi kun lurkta ukhama.
I would definitely go there again.	Chiqpachansa wasitatwa ukar sarañ munta.
He sat there in silence.	Jupajj amukiw ukan qontʼasïna.
But you want to do that.	Ukampis jumajj ukham lurañwa munta.
He didn't know why he was left alone.	Kunatsa jupa sapaki qheparäna uk janiw yatkänti.
And I started talking about it.	Ukat uka tuqit parltʼañ qalltawayta.
So tell me now.	Ukhamajj jichhajj yatiyapjjeta.
He wants nothing and needs nothing.	Jupajj janiw kunsa munkiti ni kunsa munaskiti.
If only I had the time.	Uka tiempojj utjaspa ukhajja.
I don’t say much.	Janiw sinti siskti.

It worked for about three days.	Ukax niya kimsa uruw irnaqäna.
It is a great pleasure.	Ukajj wali jachʼa kusiskañawa.
For the first time ever.	Nayrïr kutiw ukham lurawayta.
So it doesn't get any worse.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
I’d love to go there.	Nayax uka chiqar sarañax wali askiwa.
I have seen this many times recently.	Jichha tiemponjja, walja kutiw uk uñjta.

He didn't say no.	Jupajj janiw janiw siskänti.
No more, tonight.	Janiw juk’ampi, jichha arumax.
That didn't last long.	Ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
He decides to leave it where it is.	Jupax kawkhantï utjki ukaruw jaytañ amti.
And it’s funny, too.	Ukat wali muspharkañawa, ukhamaraki.
And it felt good.	Ukat wali sumaw jikxatasïna.

That's what he says.	Ukham sasaw arsu.
Well, you certainly weren’t.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa janiw jumax ukhamäkänti.
What do you think?.	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyta?.
But where .	Ukampis kawkhansa .
He didn't understand what he was doing.	Kuntï lurkäna uk janiw amuykänti.
This guy was in trouble.	Aka waynax jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
But he said that was not enough.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw säna.
Do it better.	Jukʼamp sum luram.

It took a lot out of him.	Ukajj jupat walpun apsüna.
Yeah, that's amazing.	Jïsa, ukajj muspharkañawa.
But I didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.

And he didn’t do it.	Ukat janiw uk lurkänti.
That doesn’t work anymore.	Ukax janiw juk’ampi irnaqkiti.

Now I’m worried.	Jichhax nayax llakistwa.
You know the kind.	Jumax yatisktawa uka kasta.
For the wrong thing he did.	Uka jan wali luratapat.

But there is no problem here.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis akan utjkiti.
And it really wasn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.

Or as I call them.	Jan ukajj kunjamtï nayajj jupanakar siskta ukhama.

He really didn't want to talk about it now.	Chiqpachansa janiw jichhax uka tuqit parlañ munkänti.
Soft rock, too.	Llamp’u qala, ukhamaraki.
He repeats it very well.	Jupax wali sum wasitat arsu.

So not again.	Ukhamajj janiw mayampsa.

Nothing seems right for it.	Janiw kunas ukatakix askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
And they know that.	Ukat jupanakax uk yatipxi.

But now tell me.	Ukampis jichhax yatiyapxita.
Things are not what they used to be.	Kunanakas janiw kunjamtï nayrajj utjkänti.
I think he said that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukham sänwa.
But that doesn't seem to work for me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He made the ultimate decision.	Jupaw qhipharux amtäna.
He had a different attitude.	Jupajj yaqha amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
But he stayed with you.	Ukampis jupajj jumamp chikaw qheparäna.
There was no time for anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqit pachax utjkänti.
That’s without any way.	Ukax jan kuna tuqitsa.

What is the value of the ?	¿Kunas ukajja?

I really hope it wasn't you.	Chiqpachansa, janiw jumax ukhamäkänti sasaw suytʼaskta.

There was a lot he wanted to say.	Ukanjja, walpun arsuñ munäna.

So you have to do it all the time.	Ukhamajj sapa kutiw ukham lurañama.
And he wants something.	Ukat kunsa munaraki.
He decided to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa amtäna.

But it really wasn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
But that didn't matter to me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskänti.
He started it all.	Jupaw taqe kun qalltäna.
Why, of course.	Kunatsa, chiqpachansa.
He was one of a kind.	Jupajj mä kasta jaqënwa.
I love the money.	Nayax qullqix walpun munta.
That happened the other day.	Ukaw yaqha urux pasäna.
So not everything he needs to do better.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe kunas jupatak wakiskiti jukʼamp sum lurañapa.
He stayed the same amount of time.	Jupajj pachpa tiempow ukan qheparäna.
But somehow he repeated it.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukanak wasitat arsüna.
He was very careful.	Jupajj wali sum uñjäna.
And that was absolutely necessary.	Ukat ukajj cheqapuniw wakisïna.
That you're.	Uka jumajj.
At that point he wanted to go, at any cost.	Uka pachanx jupax sarañ munäna, kuna qullqis sarañ munäna.

He wanted to know all about tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax taqpach yatxatañ munäna.
We have to do it again.	Jiwasajj wasitatwa ukham lurañasa.
He had watched it for years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw uñchʼukiskäna.

Who wants to live life.	Khitis jakañ jakañ munasi.
I’m sure you know for sure.	Nayax yatxatwa jumax chiqpachapuniw uk yatta.

Let me know once you do.	Mä kutix ukham lurasax yatiyapxita.

I never had a problem with it.	Janipuniw mä jan waltʼäwis uka tuqit utjkitänti.

You have to do it once.	Mä kuti lurañamawa.
But no one said anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns siskänti.
But that is not necessary.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
But somehow he didn't notice.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw amuyaskänti.

It’s interesting here.	Aka chiqanx wali askiwa.
There is no such person.	Janiw ukham jaqix utjkiti.
She told him about the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwit jupar yatiyäna.

Age has nothing to do with it.	Marax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
About a year or so later.	Niya mä mara jan ukajj mä mara qhepatwa.
Day and night.	Uru arumaw.
He was such a man.	Ukham jaqënwa.
And, of course, that night.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, uka arumax.
He looked after them.	Jupajj jupanakar uñjäna.
There was this amazing energy.	Uka muspharkañ ch’amaw utjäna.
I don’t know what’s out there.	Janiw kunas uka anqan utjkiti uk yatkti.
No one knows what’s going on.	Janiw khitis kunas pasaski uk yatkiti.
He’s very good to me.	Jupax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He lived there for three years.	Kimsa maraw ukan jakasïna.
So far, at least.	Jichhakamax, mä juk’a.
He had no immediate comment.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak kuns siskänti.

I’ve seen the film many times.	Walja kutiw uka película uñjta.
I decided to move it.	Nayax uka yaqha chiqar sarxañ amtawayta.
But no, you’re pretty cool.	Ukampis janiw, jumax wali suma jaqïtawa.
I expect more from myself.	Naya pachpat jukʼamp suytʼta.
Ten years later.	Tunka mara qhepatjja.
So I decided to go.	Ukatwa sarañ amtawayta.
No one thinks that way.	Janiw khitis ukham amuykiti.
It really works for you.	Chiqpachansa, jumatakix walikïskiwa.
The future is really bright.	Chiqpachansa jutïr pachanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
That’s way too early.	Ukax wali nayraw sañ muni.
Everything here is really good.	Taqi kunatix akan utjki ukax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
That won’t do anything.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkaniti.
I asked him the question.	Nayax juparux jiskt’asta.
It shook him up a bit.	Ukax juparux mä juk’a ch’allxtayäna.
Rain.	Jallu.
He’s pretty cool, too.	Jupax wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
I thought that was enough.	Ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
He’s definitely had a worse life.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw juk’amp jan walin jakasïna.
It takes time to do bad things.	Jan walinak lurañatakix tiempow munasïna.
Very, very cold.	Wali, wali thaya.
I wanted to drink water, but I couldn’t find it anywhere.	Uma umañ munta, ukampis janiw kawkhans jikxatkti.
It was, which surprised me.	Ukhamänwa, ukajj wal muspharta.
He didn’t say anything, and she didn’t understand.	Jupax janiw kuns arskänti, ukat jupax janiw amuyaskänti.
There was beer.	Ukanx cerveza ukaw utjäna.
So not after that.	Ukhamajj janiw uka qhepatjja.
I appreciate what you did for me.	Kuntï nayatak lurapkta ukajj walpun yuspärta.
After what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uka qhepatjja.
They are not good for anyone.	Jupanakax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
He wanted it, he loved it there.	Jupax munäna, ukanx walpun munasïna.
He wanted to move quickly.	Jupax jank’akiw sarnaqañ munäna.
He didn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
The box, the box, the box.	Ukaxa, ukaxa, ukaxa.
But then he quickly went back.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw kuttʼjjäna.
But so what?.	Ukampis ukhamajj ¿kunsa?.
There is no big or small.	Janiw jach’a jisk’a utjkiti.
That came later.	Ukajj qhepatwa jutäna.
That he didn't understand.	Ukajj janiw jupajj amuykänti.
It’s important, he says.	Wali wakiskiriwa sasaw saraki.
Until nothing more.	Jisk’a jan kunas juk’ampi.
I know what the cost is.	Nayax yattwa kunas qullqix utji.
I want to walk home.	Utar kayuk sarañ munta.
I can't figure out how to do that.	Kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
So he asked the question.	Ukatwa jupajj jisktʼäna.
It was in the real world.	Chiqpach pachanx ukhamänwa.
It was pretty cool, actually.	Ukax wali sumapunïnwa, chiqpachansa.
There's something about it.	Kuna tuqitsa.
The other thing is that it doesn’t.	Maynix ukax janiw.
I want to give up something.	Nayax kuns jaytañ munta.
I really didn’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkayätti.
There will be no more of this.	Janiw juk'ampi ukax utjkaniti.
The guy is amazing.	Uka waynax wali muspharkañawa.
I started driving.	Nayax auto apnaqañ qalltawayta.
I know what’s going on inside you.	Kunas juma manqhan pasaski uk yattwa.
Tell me something, between you and me.	Kuns yatiyapxita, jumamp nayamp chika.
That’s awesome!.	¡Ukax wali muspharkañawa!.
He asked me the question.	Jupax nayaruw jiskt’itu.
Instead, it needs to be done.	Jan ukasti, uka lurañaw wakisi.
You didn’t have to make a ball.	Janiw mä pelot lurañax wakiskänti.
He thought he could do it.	Jupajj uk luraspawa sasaw amuyäna.
I understood and this was excellent.	Nayax amuyasta ukat akax wali sumapunïnwa.
You’re really alone.	Chiqpachansa jumax sapakiw jikxatastaxa.
That’s what it’s about, really.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
I think that’s what you make of it.	Nayax amuyta ukax kuntix jumax ukat lurapkta ukawa.
It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachapunix wakiskiti.
He thanked me for what I had done.	Jupajj kunanaktï lurawaykta ukanakat wal yuspärta.
Once upon a time it was.	Mä kutix ukhamänwa.
I didn’t think he could do that.	Janiw jupax ukham lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
He takes good care of himself.	Jupa pachpaw wali sum uñjasi.
That’s all anyone knew.	Ukakiw khitis yatïna.
I am happier about it.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼamp kusisitaw jikxatasi.
But what can one do.	Ukampis kunsa maynix luraspa.
One year is nothing.	Mä marax janiw kunas utjkiti.
He didn't want to give a whole gift.	Jupajj janiw mä taqe regalo churañ munkänti.
Yeah, maybe we should.	Jïsa, inas ukham lurañasa.
I didn’t want to know, not really.	Janiw yatiñ munkayätti, janiw chiqpachansa.
Last year was more difficult.	Nayra marax juk’amp ch’amaw utjawayi.
There was something inside.	Kunas manqhan utjäna.
Ten years can pass.	Tunka maranakaw pasaspa.
These were not in the same place.	Ukanakajj janiw pachpa cheqan utjkänti.
She asked what was wrong.	Ukat kunas jan walïki sasaw jisktʼäna.
Certainly not now.	Chiqansa janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
He went on his own.	Jupa pachpaw saräna.
I don’t think that’s a good thing.	Nayax janiw ukax wali askïkaspas ukham amuyta.
And what's not.	Ukat kunas jan ukax.
He knew what the old man would do.	Jupajj kunsa uka jilïr jaqejj lurani uk sum yatïna.
He hoped it didn't take much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj wakiskiti sasaw suyäna.
Can’t remember his name.	Janiw sutip amtaskti.
I love it this time.	Nayax aka kutix walpun munta.
I didn't have it, either.	Nayajj janiw utjkänti, janiw ukhamäkänti.
We have to do it right the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw sum lurañasa.
I decided to do just that.	Ukham lurañwa amtawayta.
He finished the job.	Jupaw uka lurañanak tukuyäna.
Something.	Kunsa.
Then I heard it on the phone.	Ukat telefonot istʼta.
You’re the one who thinks so.	Jumax ukham amuyta.
I don’t want a character.	Janiw mä chachar munkti.
People, you know, can’t stand it.	Jaqinakax, jumax yatisktawa, janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
The guy was a nice guy.	Uka jaqejj wali suma jaqënwa.
I've done that.	Nayajj ukham lurawayta.
It is difficult to get there.	Ukar sarañajj chʼamakiwa.
What he did to me.	Kuntï jupajj nayar lurkäna ukjja.
He loved them with all his heart, as he loved them.	Jupajj jupanakar taqe chuymaw munasïna, kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhama.
I was very disappointed, you know.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta, jumax yatisktawa.
I love that challenge.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj walpun munasta.
He is immediately visible.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uñjasi.
You want to do what you can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañ munasma.
He said he didn’t like it anymore.	Jupax janiw juk’amp gustkituti sasaw säna.
Something interesting happened there.	Ukanjja, kunas wali sumaw pasäna.
And this is beautiful.	Ukat akax wali sumawa.
I have never done that.	Nayajj janipuniw ukham lurkti.
This is not the case.	Ukax janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
It happened in the past.	Nayrajj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He didn’t want a bed.	Jupax janiw mä ikiñ munkänti.
A long day, a long little day.	Mä jachʼa uru, mä jachʼa jiskʼa uru.
Everything is just that.	Taqi kunas ukhamakiw.
But he himself did not say a word.	Ukampis jupa pachpajj janiw mä arunak arskänti.
He’s more than that.	Jupax juk’ampi.
He says it’s beautiful.	Jupax wali sumawa sasaw saraki.
These are really useful.	Ukanakax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
She wanted more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw jupajj munäna.
He asked her how she was feeling.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta sasaw jisktʼäna.
He did everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kun luräna.
I’ve said it three times myself.	Naya pachpaw kimsa kutiw ukham sista.
And then and then and then rock.	Ukat ukat ukat ukat ukat ukat qala.
So I want to know about that.	Ukhamajj uka toqet yatiñ munta.
That is difficult for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj chʼamakiwa.
Then he started walking again.	Ukat wasitatwa sarnaqañ qalltäna.
Anyone know how to do that yet?.	¿Khitis jichhakamax ukham lurañ yati?.
I went first.	Nayax nayraqat sarawayta.
I’m not sure what saw him.	Kunas jupar uñjäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I think in the morning.	Nayax alwaw amuyta.
He certainly did.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham luräna.
It’s a very real person.	Mä wali chiqpach jaqiwa.
I don't have much time now.	Jichhajj janiw jukʼamp tiemponïkti.
He asked if there was anything he could do to help.	Ukat yanaptʼañatakejj kunas utji sasaw jisktʼäna.
It’s such a popular one.	Ukax ukham wali uñt’atawa.
It matters what you want.	Kuntï munkta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
There’s nothing for you.	Janiw kunas jumatakix utjkiti.
I’m going to sleep.	Nayax ikiñar saraskta.
Every other day for three weeks.	Sapa pä uru kimsa semana.
I’ve seen the blood.	Nayax wila uñjta.
Build something bigger than yourself.	Jumat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa kun luram.
I didn't want to tell him that.	Nayajj janiw jupar ukham yatiyañ munkayätti.
He does not know in advance what he is doing.	Kuntï luraski uk janiw nayratpach yatkiti.
Meaning what he secretly meant.	Kuntï jamasat sañ munkäna uk sañ muni.
They weren't like that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He’s having a great time.	Jupax wali suma pachan sarnaqaski.
I needed something really fast.	Chiqpachansa jankʼakiw kunas munasïna.
Let's see what he can do for us.	Kunsa jupajj jiwasatak luraspa uk uñjañäni.
Perhaps that is the right question.	Inas uka jisktʼajj wakischispa.
But he still sees it.	Ukampis jupajj wali sumwa uñji.
He thought it was about noon.	Niya chika uruw sasaw amuyäna.
But it won't last long.	Ukampis janiw jaya tiempojj utjkaniti.
I want to make this little statement.	Nayax aka jisk’a arunak lurañ munta.
As much as possible, as much as possible.	Kunjamtï wakiski ukhama, kunjamtï wakiski ukhama.
I want to do that.	Nayajj uk lurañwa munta.
It’s surprising, and in a way it’s fascinating.	Ukax muspharkañawa, ukat mä chiqanx wali muspharkañawa.
I don't really understand how things are.	Kunjamsa kunas utji uk janiw sum amuykti.
Honestly, it’s not the right thing to do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukax askïkiti.
There’s work to be done.	Ukanx lurañaw utji.
It took a while to get going.	Mä juk’a pachaw sarañatakix mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.
Just like he did now.	Kunjamtï jichhajj lurkäna ukhama.
He walked with her.	Jupax jupamp chikaw sarnaqäna.
Of course, this is unusual.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
It’s not every time.	Janiw sapa pachas utjkiti.
I see why it is.	Kunatsa uk uñjta.
I want to go to work.	Nayax irnaqäwir sarañ munta.
He didn’t say anywhere.	Jupax janiw kawkirus siskänti.
I like books a lot.	Nayax libronak wal gustitu.
I can't say who it is.	Khitis uk janiw siskti.
He was left devastated and completely alone.	Jupajj wali llakitaw qheparäna ukat qʼala sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
This world had been in the making for some time.	Aka pachax mä qawqha pachaw luraskäna.
He was not indifferent to it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet jan kuns lurkänti.
I want another drink.	Nayax yaqha umañ munta.
He’s a nice guy.	Jupax ukham siwa.
It didn’t mean a thing.	Janiw mä kuns sañ munkänti.
Don't do it in a hurry.	Janiw uk jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
I don't know exactly how long.	Janiw qhawqha tiempos uk sum yatkti.
I can’t do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurirjamäkti.
I can definitely make this work.	Chiqpachansa nayax aka irnaqäw lurasmati.
It’s really important.	Chiqpachansa wali wakiskiriwa.
He was doing things for the money.	Jupajj qollqe laykojj kunsa luraskäna.
Or somehow, he understood what she was saying.	Jan ukajj kunjamatsa, kuntï siskäna ukajj jupajj amuyäna.
Not that it's a good thing.	Janiw ukajj walïkiti.
I really think so.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyta.
I thought he was the best person.	Jupaw jukʼamp suma jaqëkaspas ukham amuyayäta.
I didn't think it would take so long.	Janiw ukham tiempo pasañap amuykayätti.
It’s also very hot.	Ukhamaraki wali junt’u.
This is just me alone.	Akax naya sapakiw.
In fact, he wanted to do more.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp lurañwa munäna.
There is nothing wrong with doing wrong.	Jan wali lurañajj janiw walïkiti.
But it doesn’t exist here.	Ukampis janiw akax utjkiti.
How you deal with it is what the problem is.	Kunjamsa uka tuqit lurasma ukax kuna jan waltʼäwis utji.
I started using it a while ago.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw uka apnaqañ qalltawayta.
That’s the best thing we can do.	Ukaw jiwasatak wali askïspa.
I am very pleased with what you have accomplished.	Kuntï lurapkta uk uñjasajj wal kusista.
It was a lot of people.	Ukajj walja jaqënwa.
He has both of those.	Jupajj uka panpachaniw utji.
He was a regular man.	Jupajj sapa kuti jaqënwa.
It’s what we have that to do.	Ukax kuntix jiwasax uka lurañatak utjki ukawa.
But that's not a bad thing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan walïkiti.
I don’t know exactly.	Nayax janiw sum yatkti.
He agreed wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw iyaw säna.
Things are going a bit better in the morning.	Kunanakas alwax mä juk’a sum saraski.
The food is the box.	Uka manq’a ukaxa.
They are everything you have.	Jupanakax taqi kunaw jumanakan utji.
I think that’s more fun.	Nayax amuyta ukax juk’amp kusiskañawa.
A new one.	Mä machaq.
And no one else.	Ukat janiw khitis.
And let’s see if it works.	Ukat walikïskiti janicha uk uñjañäni.
It is described below.	Ukax akham uñt’atawa.
I am not saying everything.	Janiw nayajj taqe kun siskti.
It’s all very, very exciting.	Taqi ukanakax wali, wali kusiskañawa.
And he didn’t like it.	Ukat janiw juparux gustkänti.
It happened today.	Jichhüruw ukham pasäna.
No one knows everything.	Janiw khitis taqe kun yatkiti.
It was really nice there.	Chiqansa, ukanx wali sumapunïnwa.
There was no problem with that.	Ukatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
A new day.	Mä machaq uru.
But let’s see what happened to him.	Ukampis kunas jupar pasäna uk uñjañäni.
These are known so far.	Ukanakax jichhakamax uñt’atawa.
And so always.	Ukat ukhamarakiw sapa kuti.
Is,.	Ukawa,.
He didn't tell anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus siskänti.
But he didn't do that to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus ukham lurkänti.
I really wanted to tell him.	Nayajj jupar yatiyañ wal munta.
What does it mean to be.	¿Kunsa ukajj sañ muni.
He doesn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkiti.
And it's kind of weird.	Ukat mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
But that’s rare.	Ukampis ukax juk’akiw utji.
I tried to do that.	Uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He’s a student.	Jupax yatiqiriwa.
I’ve seen these two.	Nayax uka pä jaqiruw uñjta.
That’s what it is now.	Ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
I think he would be good for that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukatakix wali askïspawa.
It’s not good, you know.	Janiw walïkiti, jumax yatisktawa.
I don't have that in me.	Nayajj janiw ukajj nayan utjkituti.
It was his own little personality, he said.	Ukajj jupan pachpa jiskʼa jaqënwa sasaw jupajj säna.
He’s a real person.	Jupax chiqpach jaqiwa.
I want to come and see you.	Nayax jumanakar uñjir jutañ munta.
Do it as badly as you can.	Kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukham jan walinak luram.
A warm day is good.	Mä junt’u urux wali askiwa.
Or some hot coffee.	Jan ukax mä juk’a junt’u café.
What he wanted.	Kunas jupax munäna.
I will not do these things myself.	Janiw naya pachpajj uka jan walinak lurkäti.
He didn't know what to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Coffee is never coffee.	Café ukax janipuniw café ukhamäkiti.
When he wanted to say something, he couldn't speak.	Kunapachatï kun sañ munkäna ukhajja, janiw parlañ puedkänti.
That’s obvious once you’re there.	Ukax qhanaw mä kutix ukanx utji.
I want to see them.	Jupanakar uñjañ munta.
He didn't want to know, he knew.	Jupajj janiw uk yatiñ munkänti, jupajj sum yatïna.
I hope that’s not the case here.	Nayax suyt’twa, janiw ukax akanx utjkiti.
For many, many years now.	Walja, walja maranakaw jichhax.
She understands his feelings better than I do.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum amuyta.
Large or small.	Jach’a jan ukax jisk’a.
I really never did.	Chiqpachansa janipuniw ukham lurkti.
He got what he wanted again.	Kuntï munkäna uk wasitatwa katoqäna.
Therefore, it follows that .	Ukatwa, akham sañ muni .
So there is nothing for it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas ukatakejj utjkiti.
It’s not like that, he said.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw säna.
I can't quite understand him.	Janiw jupar sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
But it really doesn't work that way.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
It took a year.	Mä maraw munasïna.
I know you need to do something good.	Nayax yattwa jumax mä suma lurañaw wakisi.
Somehow.	Kunjamatsa.
I decided to do it all.	Nayax taqi ukanak lurañ amtawayta.
I could do that all day.	Nayajj urunakpachaw ukham luraspäna.
And he knew what he had to do.	Ukat kuntï lurañapäkäna uk sum yatïna.
It’s pretty amazing about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali muspharkañawa.
The heat maybe.	Uka junt’u pachax inas.
But that is not a problem.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I don't have much time, so let's make this quick.	Janiw walja tiemponïkti, ukhamajj aka jankʼak lurañäni.
I did it immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw uk lurayäta.
It didn't exist at the time.	Uka tiemponjja janiw utjkänti.
But that is obviously wrong.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw jan walïkiti.
But he knew better.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
But now he’s .	Ukampis jichhax jupax .
I never thought of it before.	Janipuniw nayrajj uk amuyirïkti.
I’m the only one who’s very happy.	Naya sapakiw wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He was the only one there.	Jupa sapakiw ukan utjäna.
And it needed to be done in the future.	Ukat jutïrin ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
Each of us has a role to play.	Sapa mayniw kuna lurañas utjistu.
In fact, it seemed impossible.	Chiqansa, ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
I gave him the job.	Nayaw jupar irnaqäw churta.
I’ve done this a few times.	Mä qawqha kutiw ukham lurawayta.
They don’t know anything.	Jupanakax janiw kuns yatipkiti.
I told him he couldn’t have it.	Nayax janiw juparux utjkaspati sasaw sista.
And it never is.	Ukat janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
That, that, that.	Uka, ukat, ukat.
He loved the feeling.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk wal munäna.
And if it happens to you again, let me know, too.	Ukat jumamp wasitat ukham pasaspa ukhax yatiyapxita, ukhamaraki.
Things never do.	Kunanakas janipuniw lurkiti.
I’m not going anywhere.	Nayax janiw kawkirus sarkti.
Well, it was very nice.	Ukhama, wali suma ukhama.
He saw a lot of things.	Jupax walja yänak uñjäna.
He did not say how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw siskänti.
In the case of the.	Uka tuqitxa uka.
It was about the game.	Ukajj uka anattʼañ toqetwa parläna.
He’s the one who made them.	Jupaw jupanakar luräna.

This actually happened once.	Chiqpachansa ukax mä kutiw pasäna.
This is the reality right now.	Akax chiqpachapuniw jichhax.
Actually, a little bit.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa.
What do you see?.	¿Kunsa jumajj uñjta?.
Ten, once in a while.	Tunka, mä kuti.
Or, if he doesn't know about the problem.	Jan ukajj, uka jan waltʼäwit jan yatkaspa ukhajja.
I know exactly who he is.	Nayajj khitïnsa uk sum yatta.
Do this the night before.	Nayra arumax ukham lurañamawa.
This took two hours.	Ukatakejj pä horaw munasïna.
He called it out.	Jupax ukaruw jawsäna.
I think more now.	Jichhax juk’amp amuyta.
I just have that.	Nayax ukhamakiw utjitu.
I understand how I feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum amuyta.
It’s called a slow motion.	Ukhama satawa.
In fact, it doesn’t matter at all.	Chiqansa, janipuniw kunäkisa.
I don't know after that.	Uka qhepatjja janiw yatkti.
You know how it ended.	Kunjamsa tukuyäna uk jumax yatisktawa.
He wished it was almost impossible.	Jupajj niyaw jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham munäna.
It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.
He could or would do anything.	Jupajj kunsa luraspänwa jan ukajj luraspänwa.
I think this is very important.	Nayax amuyta akax wali wakiskiriwa.
Do it right in the morning.	Alwajj sumwa lurañama.
It looks right.	Ukax chiqapar uñtatawa.
To be honest, there was a bit too early for that.	Chiqpachansa, ukatakix mä jukʼa nayraw utjäna.
Here's to that...	Akax ukatakix...
He was doing the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk luraskäna.
He denies the money.	Jupax qullqix janiw sasaw arsu.
No one can stand him.	Janiw khitis jupar aguantañjamäkiti.
This is obviously negative.	Ukajj qhanaw jan walinak sañ muni.
I wonder what it is.	Kunas sasaw jisktʼasta.
Well, at least, at least.	Ukhama, mä juk’a, mä juk’a.
We humans, well .	Jiwasax jaqinakax, wali .
I didn't like him at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, nayajj jupar janiw munkayätti.
But it’s actually worth it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa.
I’m doing it this season and I’ve been enjoying it.	Nayax aka pachanx ukham luraskta ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I'm glad he didn't.	Jupajj jan ukham luratapat wal kusista.
You knew immediately what you were doing.	Jumax jank’akiw kuns luraskta uk yatiyäta.
Why, no one knows.	Kunatsa, janiw khitis yatkiti.
Pretty good indeed!.	¡Wali suma chiqpachansa!.
He was a very tall man.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqënwa.
I didn't want him to do that.	Nayajj janiw jupar ukham lurañap munkayätti.
So it is impossible to do these things.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkaspati.
That’s the economic side of this.	Ukaw aka tuqitx qullqi tuqit tuqitxa.
He sat up cautiously.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw qontʼasïna.
I knew what it could do.	Kunsa ukajj luraspa uk sum yatiyäta.
That’s nothing at the moment.	Ukax janiw kunas jichha pachanx utjkiti.
Me, I don’t want to do that.	Nayax, janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
I didn't know that until a few days ago.	Mä qhawqha urunak nayrajj janiw uk yatkti.
It contains the basics.	Ukanjja, kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utji.
That’s the reason.	Ukaw kunatsa.
I think he knows everything.	Nayax amuyta, jupax taqi kun yati.
He doesn't want that.	Jupajj janiw uk munkiti.
It is more than anything else.	Ukajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼampiw utji.
I'm going to	Nayax uka .
He said it was fine.	Jupajj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
That, of course, is pretty obvious.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, wali qhanawa.
Something had to be done about it.	Uka toqet kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
No, he’s not there right now.	Janiwa, jupax janiw jichhax utjkiti.
I told him this.	Nayax juparux akham sista.
I like him a lot.	Nayatakix juparux wali askiwa.
But these things are amazing.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj wali muspharkañawa.
I’ve seen worse.	Nayax juk’amp jan walinak uñjta.
I hope you enjoyed this.	Nayax suyt’twa jumanakax akax wali askiwa.
I don’t recognize anything.	Nayax janiw kuns uñt’kti.
Everything just feels right here.	Taqi kunas ukhamakiw akanx jikxatasi.
You’ve got two days now.	Jichhax pä uruw jikxatasïta.
But he's not.	Ukampis jupajj.
That’s the big guy.	Ukax jach’a jaqiwa.
It’s not worth the money.	Janiw uka qullqix wakiskiti.
Rich, and thank you very much.	Qamir, ukat walpun yuspärta.
But that's fine with me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
So he asked me to do the work.	Ukatwa uka lurañanak lurañajatak mayïtu.
It's going to be there.	Ukaruw saraski.
I have no idea what that is.	Ukajj kunas uk janiw amuykti.
I’ve never seen anything like it.	Janipuniw kunapachas ukham uñjkti.
He never had a problem.	Jupajj janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
But it will soon pass.	Ukampis niyaw pasani.
Or that's okay.	Jan ukajj ukajj walikïskiwa.
There is nothing I can do about it right now.	Jichhax janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
It doesn't work well though.	Janiw sum irnaqkiti ukampis.
He felt something.	Jupajj kuns jikjjatasïna.
Beautiful real real.	Suma chiqa chiqa.
I really don’t like it.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix wali askïkiti.
But I don't know how to say it.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk sañ yatkti.
You don’t have to do all of that.	Janiw taqi ukanak lurañax wakiskiti.
Whatever you are saying.	Kuntï jumajj siskta ukjja.
He didn't say anything about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns siskänti.
I’m doing it again.	Nayax wasitat luraskta.
I like the other way around.	Nayax yaqha tuqitx wali askiwa.
A good one, too.	Mä suma, ukhamaraki.
I don’t know where he got them.	Janiw kawkitsa jupanakar apsüna uk yatkti.
He needed help days ago.	Jupajj walja urunak nayraw yanaptʼa munäna.
Every day is the same.	Sapa uru pachpa.
So far I haven't seen anything.	Jichhakamajj janiw kuns uñjkti.
He’s the one who runs the house.	Jupaw uta apnaqi.
He wanted them even harder.	Jupajj jukʼamp chʼamampiw jupanakar munäna.
I’ve always done that.	Nayax nayratpach ukham lurawayta.
Sorry, he says.	Perdón, sasaw saraki.
He’s nice, at least.	Jupax wali sumawa, mä juk’a.
Real people aren’t like that.	Chiqpach jaqinakax janiw ukhamäkiti.
That’s something that can happen.	Ukax mä kunaw pasaspa.
He’s there with her.	Jupax jupamp chikaw ukan jikxatasi.
But he didn't agree.	Ukampis jupajj janiw iyaw siskänti.
But that wasn't quite clear.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sum amuyaskänti.
Filmmaking is fun.	Película lurañax wali kusiskañawa.
He didn’t feel too old here, surprisingly.	Aka chiqanx janiw sinti chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti, muspharkañawa.
I said both are wrong.	Nayax panpachaniw jan waliw sasaw sista.
So nice of you guys.	Ukhamajj jumanakat wali sumawa.
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Janiw khitis yatkänti, janiw khitis yatiñ munkänti.
And beyond that, it's even more exciting.	Ukat ukat sipansa, jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
Great, you think.	Jach’a, jumax amuyta.
I don’t understand the word.	Nayax janiw uka aru amuykti.
He said the money was quick and easy.	Jupax qullqix jank’akiw ukat jank’akiw sasaw säna.
He never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I have no idea what happened to him.	Kunas jupat pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
I’m the only truth.	Nayan sapa chiqa.
They are very well known.	Jupanakax wali suma uñt’atawa.
I asked him what he could do.	Kunsa lurasma sasaw jisktʼta.
No, it’s not, right.	Janiwa, ¿janich ukhamäki.
He never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham siskänti.
This often takes time.	Ukatakejj walja kutiw tiempojj munasi.
This is another woman.	Akax yaqha warmiwa.
We have plenty of time for that.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow utjistu.
Not even snowflakes.	Janiwa ukhamaraki ch’uqi.
It’s still a difficult one.	Wali ch’amawa mä.
And he loved her so much.	Ukat jupar wal munasïna.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
It can take years to do this.	Uk lurañatakejj walja maranakaw munasispa.
There is no past, no future.	Janiw nayra pachax utjkiti, janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti.
I think he’s a good guy.	Nayax amuyta jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
All of you are not enough.	Taqi jumanakax janiw wakiskiti.
And I was still enjoying it.	Ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I hope that’s the case.	Nayax ukham suyt’twa.
But nothing at the moment.	Ukampis janiw kunas jichha tiempon utjkiti.
It couldn't do that.	Ukajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I love them so much.	Jupanakar walpun munasta.
A few other things need to be done.	Mä qawqha yaqha lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
I’m going to say that.	Nayax ukham sista.
That didn't mean he would.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurani sañ munkänti.
He's a nice guy.	Jupajj ukham siwa.
We need to do this.	Jiwasax uk lurañaw wakisi.
It doesn't matter to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
That’s also what he did.	Ukhamarakiw jupax ukham lurawayi.
I think he’s okay.	Nayax jupax walikïskiwa.
He’s someone who did things, did great things.	Jupax khititix lurañanak luratayna, jach’a lurañanak luratayna.
He knows what he is doing and why.	Kunsa luraski ukat kunatsa uk sum yati.
But that wasn't the case.	Ukampis janiw ukajj ukhamäkänti.
There is no one.	Janiw khitis utjkiti.
It speaks for itself.	Ukax jupa pachpaw arsu.
That's what he said.	Ukaw jupajj säna.
So anything can happen.	Ukhamajj kunas pasaspa.
I know how to do things differently.	Nayax yaqha tuqit kuns lurañ yatta.
I don't know exactly how he feels about me.	Kunjamsa nayat jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
It’s obvious already.	Ukax qhanawa niyaw.
But he obviously didn't.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Or if something happens to him.	Jan ukajj kunas jupar pasaspa ukhajja.
He came home late.	Jupajj qhepatwa utapar purinïna.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukham säna.
No time this morning.	Jichha alwax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
Or more important to you.	Jan ukax jumatakix juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
It takes a long time.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw munasispa.
And now he thought the day had definitely arrived.	Ukat jichhax uka urux chiqpachapuniw purini sasaw amuyäna.
I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with me.	Janiw kunas nayatak jan walïki uk sum yatkti.
Don’t let anyone do it for me.	Jan khitis nayatak luramti.
And it has nothing to do with me.	Ukat janiw nayamp kuns lurkiti.
But there was definitely something about it.	Ukampis cheqapuniw uka toqet kunas utjäna.
It was definitely something.	Chiqpachansa ukax mä kunaw utjäna.
I didn’t want to give up.	Janiw jaytañ munkayätti.
He doesn't know much about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa wal yatkiti.
They do not know how this happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatipkiti.
He is absolutely unbearable.	Jupajj janipuniw aguantañjamäkiti.
He said there wasn’t.	Jupax janiw utjkiti sasaw säna.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax luräna.
But then there is no need to do that.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
That is not all bad.	Ukajj janiw taqe jan walïkiti.
There was no need to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
This was clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He turned back to me.	Jupajj nayaruw kuttʼjjäna.
I want to do everything.	Nayax taqi kun lurañ munta.
He went very well.	Jupax wali sum saräna.
They’ll still have it for years.	Jupanakax wali maranakaw ukax utjani.
He knows about you.	Jupaw jumat yati.
But I love it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa walpun munasta.
I’ve been very clear about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali qhanaw arsuwayta.
I wasn’t sure what it was.	Janiw kunas uk sum yatkayätti.
It never, ever happened.	Janipuniw, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I look forward to seeing this stuff.	Nayax aka yänak uñjañ suyt’askta.
He talked to her.	Jupampiw parläna.
He was telling the truth.	Jupajj cheq parläna.
That is my favorite character.	Ukajj nayan wali munat jaqewa.
No one knows where I’m going.	Janiw khitis kawkirus saraskta uk yatkiti.
I thought you knew it.	Nayax jumax yatisktawa sasaw amuyta.
No he never wanted to do that.	Janiwa jupax janipuniw ukham lurañ munkänti.
That’s what you need to do here.	Aka chiqanx ukham lurañaw wakisi.
It’s just so beautiful.	Ukax ukhamakiw wali suma.
But obviously, it’s not impossible.	Ukampis qhanawa, janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
Whatever he was doing, he was good.	Kunjamsa luraskäna, jupajj wali suma jaqënwa.
It was only realized once.	Mä kutikiw amuyasïna.
I don’t want to be too much.	Janiw sinti munkti.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
I saw it today.	Jichhüruw uñjta.
The red snowflakes.	Uka wila ch’uqi.
I never found one.	Janipuniw mä jikxatkti.
That’s really funny.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
He turned to me now.	Jupajj jichhajj nayaruw kuttʼjjäna.
She immediately asked why this was happening.	Ukat jankʼakiw kunatsa ukham pasaski sasaw jisktʼäna.
Or who actually did something.	Jan ukajj khitis cheqpachapun kuns luräna.
I would love to see that happen.	Ukham lurasiñap uñjañ wal munta.
He will need help tomorrow.	Jupajj qharüruw yanaptʼa munasini.
He knows exactly where he is going.	Jupajj kawkirus saraski uk sum yati.
No one could be more indifferent.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp jan kuns lurkaspänti.
So it just went away.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
You feel good, of course.	Jumax wali sum jikxatastaxa, chiqpachansa.
I kind of didn't mind.	Nayajj mä jukʼa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
This will require several repetitions.	Ukatakejj walja kuti lurañaw wakisini.
Another new one.	Yaqha machaq.
Beautiful snowflakes.	Suma ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But somehow, that doesn’t seem to work.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, ukax janiw askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
Well, things are happening.	Ukhamawa, kunanakas pasaski.
I’ve seen a lot of that time.	Nayax uka pachanx walpun uñjta.
I understand what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk sum amuyta.
He’s been around for a while.	Jupax mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.
But no, it is the reality.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, kunatï cheqäki ukawa.
This is more obvious.	Akax juk’amp qhanawa.
Large and small.	Jach’a ukat jisk’a.
People can’t exist.	Jaqinakax janiw utjkaspati.
I don’t want to see the best of days.	Janiw nayax wali suma urunak uñjañ munkti.
If he however wanted to.	Jupajj ukampis munäna ukhajja.
I’ll go with you on that.	Nayax jumamp chikaw uka tuqit sarä.
He did it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luräna.
Well do yourself that.	Suma lurañamawa juma pachpa ukhama.
By now I know what it is.	Jichhakamajj kunas uk yattwa.
And he definitely knows it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw uk yati.
I want to talk to you directly.	Nayajj jumamp chikaw parltʼañ munta.
He knows what lies ahead.	Jupajj kunas jutïrin pasani uk sum yati.
But like, pretty amazing.	Ukampis kunjamtï, suma muspharkañ.
You are truly a wonderful person.	Chiqpachansa jumax wali suma jaqïtawa.
But he didn't know exactly how he did it.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
It’s been a great night.	Mä jach’a arumaw utjawayi.
What an amazing time it is.	Kuna muspharkañ pachas utji.
He barely understood them.	Jupajj jukʼakiw jupanakar amuyäna.
I just left it at that.	Nayax ukhamakiw jaytawayta.
I can't imagine doing that.	Uk lurañajj janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
They are more or less human.	Jupanakax juk’amp jan ukax juk’amp jaqir uñtatawa.
And things happened all the time.	Ukat kunanakas sapa kutiw pasäna.
But at the time .	Ukampis uka tiemponjja .
I was surprised at how popular it was.	Ukajj kunjamsa jaqenakajj wali munasïna uk uñjasajj wal muspharta.
I want that from you.	Nayax jumanakat uk munta.
He wanted to make it awesome, now.	Jupax wali muspharkañ lurañ munäna, jichhax.
Because that’s what you need to do.	Kunatix ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Another beautiful spot.	Yaqha suma chiqa.
Anything can happen.	Kunas kunas utjaspa.
He said it was unbearable.	Jupajj janiw aguantañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
He wanted me here.	Jupajj nayaruw akan munäna.
I love it myself.	Naya pachpaw wal munasta.
What you can do is beautiful.	Kunatï lurañjamäki ukajj wali sumawa.
I really love him about him.	Chiqpachansa jupat walpun munasta.
And two of these.	Ukat pä uka.
I’m so glad he’s doing so well.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jupax ukham sum luraski.
He wants to do more.	Jupajj jukʼamp lurañwa muni.
No one knew what it was.	Janiw khitis kunas uk yatkänti.
I didn’t want to live anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha cheqan jakañ munkayätti.
And another, another.	Ukat yaqha, yaqha.
He knows how to get to me.	Jupax nayar puriñ yati.
He told her something that surprised her.	Jupajj kunatï wal muspharäna uk yatiyäna.
That’s left it.	Ukax jaytawayi.
Of course, he didn't know exactly where to go.	Chiqansa, kawkirus sarañapa ukxa janiw sum yatkänti.
People know how to do it.	Jaqinakax lurañ yatipxi.
It’s just kind of weird.	Ukhama mä kasta muspharkañawa.
You don’t even have to do these things properly.	Janiw ukanak sum lurañas wakiskiti.
That, he expected.	Ukjja, jupajj suyäna.
Both are excellent.	Panpachaniw wali suma.
He leaves again.	Jupax wasitatwa sarxi.
Or so she said.	Jan ukajj ukham sasaw jupajj säna.
But that is acceptable at the moment.	Ukampis ukajj jichha tiempon walikïskiwa.
Maybe yours too.	Inas jumanakan ukhamaraki.
I think it doesn’t.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukhamäkiti.
If you want to learn more.	Jumatix juk’amp yatxatañ munsta ukhaxa.
And never again.	Ukat janipuniw mayampsa.
I would definitely use this.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw aka apnaqañ munta.
But he knew something was seriously wrong.	Ukampis kunas sinti jan walïki uk sum yatïna.
I gave it to him.	Nayaw jupar churta.
Just like you said.	Kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhama.
I didn’t know what was happening to me.	Kunas nayar pasaski uk janiw yatkayätti.
That’s better, he says.	Ukax juk’amp askiwa, sasaw saraki.
I think in this country.	Nayax aka markanx amuyta.
So he was afraid.	Ukatwa jupajj ajjsaräna.
The snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
It was really painful.	Chiqpachansa wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I ask myself the same question.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jisktʼasta.
But I love something about him.	Ukampis jupat mä jukʼa walpun munasta.
I’ve seen them.	Nayax jupanakar uñjta.
One of two things will happen.	Pä tuqit mayniw pasani.
There is no need to rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskiti.
But it turns out that wasn't the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyasi.
That's how it goes.	Ukhamaw sarxi.
He told me himself.	Jupa pachpaw sitäna.
And that’s really amazing.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
What would be the best way to do that.	Kunas ukham lurañax wali askïspa.
And better yet good.	Ukat juk’amp askiwa suma.
He wanted to sleep.	Jupajj ikiñ munäna.
I was terrified of doing so.	Ukham lurasajj walpun ajjsarayäta.
That is not a good question.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw walïkiti.
I really mean a lot.	Chiqpachansa walpun sañ munta.
He wasn't sure how it happened, but he knew it happened.	Kunjamsa pasäna uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis ukajj pasäna uk sum yatïna.
It feels long, of course.	Ukax jaya pachaw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
Time is like that.	Tiempo ukax ukhamawa.
I'm coming with you.	Nayajj jumamp chikaw jutta.
Little.	Jisk'a.
And he was kind of like that.	Ukat jupax mä jukʼa ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
He took the money.	Jupaw uka qollqe apsüna.
It’s something that’s both at once.	Ukax kunas ukax panpachaniw mä kutin.
He could have done anything, but this.	Jupax kuns luraspänwa, ukampis aka.
He never told them.	Jupajj janipuniw jupanakar siskänti.
Everything is an opportunity.	Taqi kunas mä oportunidad ukhamawa.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing, she said.	Jupax janiw kuntix luraski uk yatkiti, sasaw saraki.
I don’t understand anything.	Nayax janiw kuns amuykti.
I have felt this way for years.	Walja maranakaw ukham amuyasta.
It just looks so good.	Ukax ukhamakiw wali suma uñtasi.
But he was an individual.	Ukampis jupajj mä sapa jaqënwa.
I wanted to make it as simple as possible.	Ukajj kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukhamarjam lurañwa munta.
He knocked on the door twice.	Jupax pä kutiw punku ch’allt’äna.
Do what you want with it.	Uka tuqitxa kuntï munkta uk lurañamawa.
Or a week ago.	Jan ukax mä semana nayra.
But there is nothing beyond that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkiti.
This world is beautiful.	Aka pachax wali sumawa.
It can’t be that guy.	Janiw uka waynax utjkaspati.
He used to be happy.	Jupajj nayrajj kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it turned out better.	Ukampis jukʼamp sumaw pasäna.
I told him that.	Ukham sasaw jupar sista.
No, he’s not going anywhere.	Janiwa, jupax janiw kawkirus sarkiti.
I feel like he has done that before.	Nayrajj ukham lurkäna ukhamwa amuyasta.
I wish that was longer.	Nayax ukax juk’amp jaya pachaw munasispa.
You’re not one of a kind.	Jumax janiw mä kasta.
In fact, there was no reason to do so.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna razonas ukham lurañax utjkänti.
I tried to do everything I could.	Nayajj taqe kun lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He was such a cute little man!.	¡Jupajj wali munat jiskʼa jaqënwa!.
I decided to go to bed early.	Nayratpach ikiñar sarañ amtawayta.
Maybe not again.	Inas jan mayampsa.
I wasn’t expecting this.	Nayax janiw uk suykayätti.
Something needs to be done.	Kuns lurañaw wakisi.
I don’t need things now.	Jichhax janiw kunanakas munaskiti.
Or who knows for sure.	Jan ukajj khitis uk sum yati.
I was amazed at what he did.	Uka luratapat wal muspharta.
I understand them well.	Nayax jupanakar sum amuyta.
There is no other way.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa utjkiti.
Now I understood that.	Jichhajj uk sum amuyayäta.
All, everything was excellent.	Taqi, taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
In fact, I like it a lot.	Chiqansa, nayatakix walpun gustitu.
No, it wasn’t very good.	Janiwa, wali sumapunïnwa.
I know what that is.	Ukajj kunas uk sum yatta.
Well done, me.	Suma lurawayta, naya.
He was the perfect person for the role.	Jupajj uka lurañatakejj wali suma jaqënwa.
There really was nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkänti.
I was a very nice guy.	Nayajj wali sumapunïnwa.
I saw what happened to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna uk uñjta.
And it happened faster.	Ukat jukʼamp jankʼakiw pasäna.
Shorter than you or, no, shorter.	Jumat sipansa juk’amp jisk’a jan ukax, janiw, juk’amp jisk’a.
I did it pretty well.	Nayajj wali sumwa uk lurawayta.
It’s a big, big guy.	Mä jach’a, jach’a jaqiwa.
He doesn’t have anything.	Jupax janiw kunas utjkiti.

Who is he?.	¿Khitis jupajj?.
Everything was quiet.	Taqi kunas amukiw utjäna.
It was obvious to me.	Nayatakejj ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I'm sure you're right.	Nayajj sum yatta.
What do you expect, he said.	Kunsa suyt’ta, sasaw säna.
How comfortable I feel here.	Kunjamsa akan sum jikjjatasta.
He looked happy about it.	Jupajj ukat kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
But that didn't seem to work.	Ukampis ukajj janiw askïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
I think that is very important.	Ukajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
I think he’s better.	Nayax jupax juk’amp askiwa sasaw amuyta.
And he told everyone about it.	Ukat taqiniruw uka tuqit yatiyäna.
I think that’s amazing.	Nayax ukax muspharkañawa sasaw amuyta.
It’s definitely been something so far.	Chiqpachansa jichhakamax mä kunaw utjawayi.
She told him what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk jupar yatiyäna.
Thank you for nothing.	Jan kunatsa yuspärta.
You are not available now.	Jichhajj janiw jumanakajj utjkiti.
Not available at the moment.	Janiw jichha pachanx utjkiti.
No one had done this before.	Janiw khitis nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
I’ve seen this for a long time.	Nayax walja tiempow uk uñjta.

It won’t last much longer.	Janiw juk’ampi jaya pachax utjkaniti.
It’s still .	Ukax wali .
Of course, he didn’t.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukham lurkänti.
So I don't ever remember.	Ukhamajj janiw kunapachas amtaskti.
I’m afraid there is none.	Nayax axsaratwa janiw kunas utjkiti.
Then in the morning it rained.	Ukat alwax jallux purinïna.
I really didn’t want this.	Chiqpachansa janiw akax munkayätti.
So there was nothing there.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
I’m going to be happy.	Nayax kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I want one of these.	Nayax mä munta.
Sorry, he said later.	Perdón, sasaw qhepat säna.
I know exactly what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk sum yatta.
Now he’s quiet.	Jichhax jupax amukiw jikxatasi.
He was very happy to do so.	Ukham lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But he’s still a human being.	Ukampis jupax wali jaqiwa.
But that's not what you want.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuntï jumajj munkta ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t really care and I told him that.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix kuns lurkti ukat juparux ukham sista.
I don’t really know.	Janiw chiqpachapunix yatkti.
He wasn’t and now he never was.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti ukat jichhax janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
There was no one like him.	Jupat sipansa janiw khitis utjkänti.
He worked all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw irnaqäna.
He will do what you want.	Jupaw kuntï munkta uk lurani.
It will come too soon for you.	Jumatakejj wali jankʼakiw purini.
That’s what you need to do.	Uka lurañaw wakisi.
I want to rush this lunch.	Nayax aka chika uru manq’añax jank’akiw sarañ munta.
Not tonight, but soon.	Janiw jichha arumax, jan ukasti jank’akiw.
Well, he did that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukham luräna.
I had no idea what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
Of course you don’t want to give up.	Chiqansa janiw jaytañ munktati.
Not this time very happy thank you very much.	Janiw aka kutix wali kusisitaw walpun yuspärta.
Didn't do anything beyond that.	Janiw ukat sipansa kuns lurkänti.
No it wasn’t.	Janiwa janiw ukhamäkänti.
And why he stayed.	Ukat kunatsa qheparäna.
The only problem was that he was too excited not to eat.	Jan manqʼañatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukakiw jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
The night is beautiful.	Uka arumax wali sumawa.
I’m just starting to learn about it.	Nayax jichhakiw uka tuqit yatxatañ qalltawayta.
But he gave me a lot of strength.	Ukampis wal chʼam churäna.
But in the end, there was nothing to do.	Ukampis qhepatjja, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
The man claims the money was a gift.	Uka jaqix uka qullqix mä regalo ukhamaw sasaw arsu.
And he has done just that.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw lurawayi.
But I don’t want that to happen.	Ukampis janiw ukham pasañap munkti.
It doesn’t go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarkiti.
They know exactly what is needed.	Kunas wakisi uk sum yatipxi.
But it takes some work.	Ukampis mä jukʼa lurañaw wakisi.
But, it doesn’t work.	Ukampis, janiw irnaqkiti.
This takes time.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasi.
And that’s what’s important here.	Ukat ukax aka chiqanx wali wakiskiriwa.
Now he is fine.	Jichhajj jupajj walikïskiwa.
This is a beautiful house.	Aka suma uta.
I love doing these things.	Ukanak lurañax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I saw him again.	Nayajj wasitatwa jupar uñjta.
Well, you know,.	Ukhama, jumax yatisktawa,.
Very often wrong.	Wali walja kutiw jan wali.
It’s hard, you know.	Ukax ch’amawa, jumax yatisktawa.
You can do the same thing.	Jumax ukhamarakiw lurasma.
That’s nice, at least.	Ukax wali sumawa, mä juk’a.
Very nice one.	Wali suma mä.
They’ve been around for a long time.	Jupanakax jaya pachaw utji.
He had seen it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uk uñjäna.
I’m sure there’s none of that.	Nayax yatxatwa janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
You’ve got the chance.	Jumax uka ch’amampiw jikxatasïta.
It was a very nice day.	Wali suma uru.
All of you are welcome.	Taqi jumanakax wali askiwa.
And each one has something to do.	Ukat sapa mayniw kuna lurañas wakisispa.
Let’s see how it goes!.	¡Kunjamsa saraski uk uñjañäni!.
I’m feeling silent.	Nayax amukiw jikxatastxa.
Now you have to act quickly.	Jichhajj jankʼakiw lurañama.
Nowhere was safe.	Janiw kawkhans jan kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He goes by himself.	Jupa pachpaw saraski.
Wine, he thought.	Vino, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
And I realized it immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw uk amuyayäta.
How that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna.
Breakfast gave him energy.	Desayuno ukax juparux ch’am churäna.
Red, too, perhaps.	Wila, ukhamaraki, inas.
I didn't know that about him.	Nayajj janiw jupat uk yatkayätti.
It will be inside.	Ukax manqhan utjani.
The man didn't really want her.	Uka jaqejj janiw cheqpachapun jupar munkänti.
But these are important.	Ukampis ukanakajj wali wakiskiriwa.
That’s not good enough for me.	Ukax nayatakix janiw askïkiti.
That’s always nice.	Ukax sapa kutiw wali suma.
He doesn’t think so.	Jupax janiw sasaw amuyi.
He leaves in great distress.	Jupax wali llakitaw sarxi.
As is the fact of the matter.	Kunjamtï uka cheqäki ukhama.
Small or large.	Jisk’a jan ukax jach’a.
Both of these get to him.	Uka panpachaniw jupar puri.
It stayed that way for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj ukham qheparäna.
He almost refused to take it.	Jupax niyaw uka apsuñ jan munkänti.
But he can do that.	Ukampis jupajj ukham luraspawa.
Also and .	Ukhamaraki ukat .
What do you have in common?.	¿Kunas jumatakix utji?.
I would like to reiterate,.	Nayax wasitat arsuñ munta,.
But really, it’s not.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
The man knew exactly what he wanted.	Uka jaqejj kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
He could have done both.	Jupajj panpachaniw luraspäna.
She is better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.
And it always will.	Ukat sapa kutiw ukham lurani.
It is almost .	Ukax niya .
I just can't do anything about it.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
And he’s doing it now.	Ukat jupax jichhax luraski.
Tomorrow will be better, and the next day will be better.	Qhipürux juk’amp sumaw utjani, ukat qhipürux juk’amp sumaw utjani.
It will be better in the winter.	Juyphi pachanx juk’amp sumaw utjani.
That that now you know that.	Uka ukax jichhax yatisktawa ukax.
I didn’t want them.	Janiw jupanakar munkayätti.
He asked her to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañapatakiw mayïna.
This time around.	Aka kutix.
I want to use you.	Nayax jumanakar apnaqañ munta.
That’s kind of fun.	Ukax mä kasta kusiskañawa.
More and more.	Juk’ampi juk’ampi.
He really wanted to sleep.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ikiñ munäna.
I want to do better things.	Nayax juk’amp suma lurañanak lurañ munta.
I don’t know what’s going on inside, what’s going on outside.	Janiw kunas manqhan pasaski, kunas anqan luraski ukx yatkti.
Now it’s obvious.	Jichhax qhanaw uñjasi.
I never said anything else.	Janipuniw yaqha ukham siskti.
He was never like that.	Janipuniw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
That’s what gave me.	Ukaw nayar churitu.
Now let me know what you think.	Jichhax kuntï jumax amuykta uk yatiyapxita.
I see everybody from everywhere.	Nayax taqiniruw taqi chiqat uñjta.
Really, it’s worth it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
A lot of work needs to be done.	Walja lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
Which now, he obviously wasn’t.	Ukax jichhax, qhanaw jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I never remember that.	Janipuniw uka toqet amtaskti.
I see no reason why he should.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa ukxa janiw kuna razonas uñjkti.
He refused to use it.	Jupajj janiw apnaqañ munkänti.
But it still looks good.	Ukampis wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.
In fact, right now .	Chiqansa, jichhax .
And boy did it ever come through.	Ukat waynax kunapachas uka tuqit jutäna.
He began to smile.	Jupax qalltäna.
And boy does it feel good!.	Ukat waynax wali sumaw jikxatasi!.
Do the same thing.	Ukham luram.
Actually, that’s it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamawa.
He slammed the door.	Jupax punku ch’allt’äna.
I’m so excited for that.	Nayax ukatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
How you feel is important.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Of course, there was some truth to that.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa chiqaw utjäna.
That’s how they are.	Ukhamaw jupanakax ukhama.
I think that’s the hardest part.	Nayax ukax juk’amp ch’amaw sasaw amuyta.
A little more time.	Mä juk’a pachaw juk’ampi.
Maybe that will happen soon.	Inas ukajj niyaw pasaspa.
I felt that way for years.	Walja maranakaw ukham amuyayäta.
Nothing seemed to work for me.	Janiw kunas nayatakejj askïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
But there is nothing that can be done about it now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kunas uka toqet lurañjamäkiti.
He himself realized this early on.	Jupa pachpaw uk nayratpach amuyasïna.
I didn't want to eat.	Janiw manqʼañ munkayätti.
That something is just so.	Uka kunas ukax ukhamakiw ukhama.
I think it’s pretty good.	Nayax wali sumaw sasaw amuyta.
And he was making himself a drink.	Ukat jupa pachpaw mä umañ luraskäna.
I don’t think that’s appropriate.	Nayax janiw ukax askïkaspas ukham amuyta.
It’s like a human being.	Mä jaqir uñtatawa.
It’s more and more.	Ukax juk’ampi juk’ampi.
And he spoke about it immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw uka tuqit parläna.
You know this would be good for me.	Jumax yatisktawa akax nayatakix wali askïspawa.
It’s doing fine today.	Jichhürunakanx wali sum luraski.
But I'm not sure what I want to do.	Ukampis kuntï lurañ munkta uk janiw sum amuykti.
Of course, that would be a good thing.	Chiqansa, ukax wali askïspawa.
He could have done anything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa luraspäna.
There’s nothing there that’s either or isn’t.	Janiw kunas ukanx sapa maynix jan ukax jan ukax utjkiti.
I’ve mentioned it.	Nayax uka tuqit arsuwayta.
Most of all, he was very happy.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He said it was beautiful.	Jupax wali sumawa sasaw säna.
He didn’t ever do it.	Jupax janiw kuna pachas lurkänti.
I don't have long.	Janiw jaya tiempojj utjkituti.
I don't know why you feel even worse.	Kunatsa jumajj jukʼamp jan walinak amuyasta uk janiw yatkti.
This time it came from the left.	Jichha kutix ch’iqa tuqit jutäna.
There is time for that later.	Ukatakejj qhepat tiempow utji.
He didn't want to do anything worse.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
He wasn't sure what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk janiw sum amuyaskänti.
Well, maybe a little bit.	Ukhama, inas mä juk’a.
It is something anyone can do.	Ukajj khitis lurañjamäki ukawa.
I don’t think anyone does.	Nayax janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
I want him to be there.	Nayax juparux munta.
Too bad you and you.	Sinti jan waliw jumamp jumampi.
He didn't really want her.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun jupar munkänti.
I will never do that again.	Janiw mayamps ukham lurkäti.
I don’t know why it wasn’t.	Janiw kunatsa jan ukhamäkänti uk yatkti.
He had always been very positive about it.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uka toqet wali sum arsüna.
Today he did just that.	Jichhürojj ukhamwa luräna.
I’ve given it up for a long time.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw jaytawayta.
Let’s do what we can about it.	Uka tuqitxa kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañäni.
You’re too good for it.	Jumax ukatakix wali sumaw jikxatastaxa.
I didn’t want to drive it.	Nayax janiw uka autot sarañ munkayätti.
Of course, there was something there.	Chiqansa, kunas ukan utjäna.
You can’t tell me to do something.	Jumax janiw kuns luram sañjamäkiti.
I am so sorry for what he did.	Ukham luratapat walpun llakista.
He wants to go out on his own.	Jupa pachpaw mistuñ muni.
I’ve seen all of these.	Taqi ukanak uñjta.
Of course, he didn't mean anything.	Chiqansa, janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
That’s every bit of it.	Ukax sapa mayniw mä juk’a.
He didn't want to know any more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkänti.
And that was a year ago.	Ukat ukajj mä mara nayraw pasäna.
He called after her.	Jupajj jupar qhepatwa jawsäna.
I feel so much better now.	Jichhajj wali sumaw jikjjatasta.
Last year was pretty good.	Nayra marax wali sumapunïnwa.
I thought it was fine.	Nayajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
There was little truth in it.	Ukanjja, jukʼa cheqapuniw utjäna.
And this was it.	Ukat akax ukhamänwa.
No, he said.	Janiwa, sasaw säna.
No, it really is.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
The first winter was cold and clear.	Nayrïr juyphi pachax thaya ukat qhanaw utjäna.
And he didn’t want to.	Ukat janiw munkänti.
All of these are important.	Taqi ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
Why would he do that.	¿Kunatsa jupajj ukham luraspa.
I don't want to do that.	Nayajj janiw uk lurañ munkti.
Do what you want me to do.	Kuntï nayar munkta uk luram.
There will never be, there will never be.	Janipuniw utjkaniti, janipuniw utjkaniti.
That’s what you do.	Ukhamaw jumax lurasma.
He didn't know what he was doing, not really.	Jupajj janiw kuntï luraskäna uk yatkänti, janiw cheqpachapun yatkänti.
What happened to you.	Kunas jumamp pasäna.
I had no idea who he was.	Khitïnsa uk janiw amuykayätti.
So yes, it is.	Ukhamajj jïsa.
I can't figure out how to do that.	Kunjamsa uk lurañax uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
You know, of course.	Jumax yatisktawa, chiqpachansa.
And then he started moving.	Ukat ukat jupax yaqha chiqar sarxañ qalltäna.
He never knew how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
I never liked it.	Janipuniw ukajj gustkituti.
And you are better off.	Ukat jumax jukʼamp askiwa.
It can be both.	Ukajj panpachaniw utjaspa.
He could have done it well.	Jupajj uk sum luraspäna.
I think the answer is yes.	Nayax amuyta, ukax jïsa sañ muni.
But he understood it well.	Ukampis jupajj sumwa amuyäna.
Or so it was until now.	Jan ukajj jichhakamajj ukhamänwa.
They’re a little better.	Jupanakax mä juk’a juk’amp askiwa.
This surprised him.	Ukajj jupar walpun muspharäna.
Or there is nothing.	Jan ukax janiw kunas utjkiti.
You might as well.	Jumax ukhamarakiw inas.
After that it is not.	Uka qhepatjja janiw ukhamäkiti.
As much as they can.	Kunjamtï jupanakax lurañjamäki ukhama.
I didn’t want to see it through.	Janiw uka tuqit sum uñjañ munkayätti.
Or later on.	Jan ukajj qhepatjja.
Here’s what you can do.	Aka tuqitxa kunsa lurasma uk uñjañäni.
I’m looking for something real.	Nayax chiqpach kuns thaqhaskta.

Really looking forward to seeing this.	Chiqpachansa aka uñjañ suyt’askta.
Someone always goes, you know.	Maynix sapa kutiw saraski, jumax yatisktawa.
He went away a lot.	Jupajj wal sarjjäna.
I didn't have that.	Nayajj janiw ukajj utjkitänti.
There is something you can do.	Kuna lurañas wakisispa.
I want to see him.	Jupar uñjañ munta.
How long have you been doing this? 	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukham luraskta?
The point is to be sincere and committed.	Uka tuqitxa, taqi chuymaw chʼamachasiñama ukat taqi chuymaw chʼamachasiñama.
It is better than these.	Ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
There was nothing like that here.	Janiw kunas ukham aka chiqanx utjkänti.
And for that, it’s fine.	Ukat ukatakix walikïskiwa.
I don’t see it that way.	Janiw ukham uñjkti.
But it doesn't work well.	Ukampis janiw sum irnaqkiti.
It’s funny, that.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, ukax.
But the outcome is pretty clear.	Ukampis kunas pasani ukajj wali qhanawa.
So he worked on it.	Ukatwa uka tuqitxa irnaqäna.
It was that kind of night.	Uka kasta arumaw utjäna.
After the first year or two, there is more.	Nayrïr mara jan ukajj pä mara qhepatjja, jukʼampiw utji.
Not now, not ever.	Janiw jichhax, janiw kuna pachas.
He just wanted power.	Jupajj jichhakiw chʼam munäna.
I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong.	Kuntï jan wal lurkta uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
I don't know who was watching from behind.	Khitis qhepat uñchʼukiskäna uk janiw yatkti.
It had to be done, as he had planned.	Ukham lurañaw wakisïna, kunjamtï jupax amtkäna ukhama.
He knew he could do that.	Ukham luraspa uk sum yatïna.
Both are great.	Panpachaniw wali jach’a.
All, all, all.	Taqi, taqi, taqi.
I can’t stand this anymore.	Nayax janiw juk’amp akax aguantañjamäkiti.
No, that's not the worst part.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
No one was in the room.	Janiw khitis uka cuarto manqhan utjkänti.
But what do I know.	Ukampis kunsa nayajj yatta.

But there is nothing that can be done about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka toqet lurañjamäkiti.

Very hot water.	Sinti junt’u uma.

Good luck to you tonight.	Jichha arumax jumatakix wali askiwa.
He told himself it would be a long time.	Walja tiempow utjani sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.

But he refused to go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ munkänti.
I like him a little bit more.	Nayax juparux mä juk’a juk’amp munasta.
Then he realized what had just happened.	Ukat kunatï jichhak paskäna uk amuyasïna.
You’ll feel better.	Jumax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasïta.
It took him about two hours.	Ukatakejj niya pä horaw jupajj pasäna.
But it’s not, it’s funny.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, wali muspharkañawa.
But he never thought of it that way.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham amuykänti.

Not impossible, just difficult.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti, jan ukasti chʼamakiwa.

He seemed to be in bad shape.	Jupajj jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
It really means a lot.	Chiqpachansa walpun sañ muni.
And finally he said something.	Ukat qhepatjja, kuns arsüna.
It’s not necessary and it doesn’t work at all.	Janiw wakiskiti ukat janiw kunjamatsa irnaqkiti.
I was very excited, actually.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, chiqpachansa.

I want nothing to do with it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet mä jukʼa lurañ munkti.
I have no idea what the problem is.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk janiw amuykti.
He hasn’t done that yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax ukham lurkiti.
Maybe in another way.	Inas yaqha tuqitxa.
He’s always ‘inside’.	Jupax sapa kutiw ‘manqhan’ jikxatasi.
Eventually, he found out.	Qhepatjja, uk yatïna.
Now there is nothing for it.	Jichhax janiw kunas ukatakix utjkiti.
It doesn't matter what you actually say.	Kuntï cheqpachapun siskta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I would love to see that.	Uk uñjañ wal munta.
But that is our coffee.	Ukampis ukajj jiwasan café satawa.
That's what he knew.	Ukhamaw jupajj yatïna.
And so quickly.	Ukat ukhama jankʼakiw.
That’s one of the things.	Ukax mä tuqitxa.
Our	Jiwasan .
I want to get out of it very soon.	Nayax ukat wali jank’akiw mistuñ munta.
And the water.	Ukat uma.
I know how that feels.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
A new school.	Mä machaq yatiqañ uta.
I kind of like it.	Nayajj mä jukʼa gustitu.
That is the most important question of all.	Uka jisktʼajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
He had no idea what was going on here.	Jupajj kunas akan pasaski uk janiw amuykänti.
There was time to do it.	Uka tiempon lurañaw utjäna.
Now he thought he could.	Jichhajj ukham luraspa sasaw amuyasïna.
We don’t have that yet.	Jiwasax janiw ukax jichhakamax utjkiti.
But he didn't know what to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
A room in his own house.	Jupan pachpa utapan mä cuarto.
He’s not like that, never.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
That was a one-time thing, wasn't it.	Ukajj mä kutikiw pasäna, ¿janich ukhamäki.
I don’t know what the future holds.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.
How useful is that?.	¿Kunjamsa ukajj wali askïspa?.
One good, three bad.	Mä suma, kimsa jan wali.
He has done so well for us.	Jupajj jiwasatak wali sumwa lurawayi.
How much money was needed.	Qhawqha qullqis munasïna.
I have no problem with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
I know what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk yattwa.
I don't know how to say it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk sañ yatkti.
He had done this before.	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamwa luratayna.
What is the problem?.	¿Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji?.
He doesn't like what's going to happen.	Jupajj kunas pasani uk uñjasajj janiw walïkiti.
He thought nothing of himself.	Jupa pachpat janiw kuns amuykänti.
So that's not there.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw ukan utjkiti.
And as he had done before.	Ukat kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama.
It looks long and beautiful.	Ukax wali jaya ukat wali suma uñtatawa.
But the point is clear.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanawa.
I don't want to talk about it any more.	Janiw jukʼamp uka toqet parlañ munkti.
Doesn’t mean he didn’t.	Janiw jupax jan lurkänti sañ munkiti.
It doesn’t matter what came before.	Janiw kunas nayrax jutäna ukax wakiskiti.
If you know how to use them.	Jumatix ukanak apnaqañ yatta ukhaxa.
He does this every day.	Jupajj sapa uruw ukham luri.
But something comes eventually.	Ukampis kunas qhipharux purini.
Anyone but me.	Khitis jan ukasti nayat sipansa.
We will take good care of you.	Jiwasajj wali sumwa uñjañäni.
Another twenty years.	Yaqha pä tunka mara.
And, and, and.	Ukat, ukat, ukat.
There is no	Janiw kuna .
Now, let’s see.	Jichhax, uñjañäni.
Well, don’t say you’re not.	Ukhama, janiw jumax janiw ukhamäkti sañ munktati.
Almost no one did.	Niya janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
This is not impossible.	Ukajj janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
Well, there was never enough time, really.	Ukhama, janipuniw tiempox utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
I almost feel like I'm doing it myself.	Niya naya pachpaw uk luraskta ukham amuyasta.
We’re going to.	Jiwasax uka.
But I had no choice.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
¡I'm so excited!.	¡Nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta!.
So you just tell me.	Ukhamajj jumajj nayarojj yatiyapjjeta.
I don’t think that’s entirely true.	Nayax janiw ukax taqpach chiqaw sañ munkti.
Let me know if you disagree with me!.	¡Janiw nayamp iyaw sañjamäkiti uk yatiyapxita!.
I don’t quite know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw taqpach yatkti.
I want to stay here.	Nayax akan qhiparañ munta.
I am looking for a long term job.	Nayax jaya pachan irnaqañ thaqhaskta.
Maybe you can do that somehow.	Inas kunjamatsa ukham lurañax wakischispa.
I wish I had better words.	Nayax juk’amp suma arunak arsuñ munta.
Everyone has it.	Taqinipuniw ukax utji.
He said that many times.	Walja kutiw ukham arsüna.
But he couldn't speak.	Ukampis janiw parlañ puedkänti.
He doesn't do a little bit.	Jupajj janiw mä jukʼa kunsa lurkiti.
There wasn’t much money.	Janiw sinti qullqi tuqit utjkänti.
But he never liked it.	Ukampis janipuniw juparux gustkänti.
I want to eat something.	Nayax mä manq’añ munta.
That will take a week or two.	Ukatakejj mä semana jan ukajj pä semanaw pasani.
And what is so wrong with this.	Ukat kunas aka tuqitxa wali jan walïki ukaxa.
But he now saw clearly what he had to do.	Ukampis kuntï lurañapäkäna uk jichhajj sumwa uñjäna.
I’m busy with time.	Nayax jan tiemponiw jikxatastxa.
I’m a little skeptical.	Nayax mä juk’a pächasta.
Who does he think he is.	Khitis jupajj amuyi.
He’s good, so good.	Jupax wali sumawa, ukhama suma.
He knew how it worked.	Kunjamsa ukajj irnaqäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
So it can happen many times.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw pasaspa.
That wasn’t the case.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I didn't want to come here.	Janiw nayajj akan jutañ munkayätti.
I did well for it.	Ukatakejj nayajj sumwa lurayäta.
I didn’t know what to do with myself.	Janiw naya pachpat kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
I don’t feel like I really want to.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni munkta ukham amuyasta.
It worked hard.	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw irnaqäna.
I’m so happy to eat.	Nayax wali kusisitaw manq’añax utjitu.
You have to tell him that.	Ukham sasaw jupar yatiyañama.
He planned it all first.	Jupaw nayraqat taqe ukanak amtäna.
I am very, very disappointed.	Nayax wali, wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He was shaking violently.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
And he talked about what he thought.	Ukat kuntï jupajj amuyki uka toqetwa parläna.
Not so tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s really obvious.	Chiqpachansa ukax qhanawa.
Actually, the build is really nice.	Chiqansa, lurañax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
Everything is so happy there.	Taqi kunas ukanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
They never really exist.	Jupanakax janipuniw kunapachas chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
Where that doesn't matter.	Kawkhantï ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He’s just left.	Jupax jichhakiw sarxi.
He lay quietly for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempojj amukiw ikiskäna.
She knew that if she did, he knew how she felt.	Ukham luraspa ukhajja, kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk jupajj sum yati sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.
Now there’s none of that.	Jichhax janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
She was looking right at him.	Jupajj jupar cheqapuniw uñchʼukiskäna.
So don't do it.	Ukhamajj jan luramti.
Now I know how to do it well.	Jichhajj sum lurañ yatta.
These are very common.	Ukanakax wali uñt’atawa.
He shared his feelings about the situation.	Uka jan waltʼäwit kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk jupaw yatiyäna.
I don’t remember what happened after that.	Uka qhepat kunas pasäna uk janiw amtaskti.
The last one was last year.	Qhip qhipa marax pasïr maraw utjäna.
This lasted about three days.	Ukajj niya kimsa uruw pasäna.
Someone else did that.	Mayniw ukham luräna.
He didn't know where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He was really surprised.	Chiqpachansa jupax wal muspharäna.
No, he didn't mean that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
The day ended in love.	Uka urux wali munasiñampiw tukuyäna.
Now it takes about half an hour a month.	Jichhax mä phaxsinx niya chika horaw munasispa.
I don't remember how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw amtaskti.
They had no future.	Jupanakajj janiw jutïrin utjkänti.
He’s nothing like that.	Jupax janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
A young man lives in trouble for a year.	Mä waynax mä maraw jan walt’äwin jakasi.
In this regard.	Aka tuqitxa.
He was alone in a bed.	Jupajj sapakiw mä ikiñan ikiskäna.
That’s exactly what he wants.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munki.
She asked him what he was looking for.	Ukat kuns thaqhaskta sasaw jisktʼäna.
Of course, no one knows for sure.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
Whether it’s real or not doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janicha ukax janiw kunäkisa.
We still have half an hour.	Jiwasax wali chika horaw utjistu.
It’s been a really long time actually.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya pachaw chiqpachansa.
Somehow he survived.	Kunjamatsa jupax jakasïna.
I asked him to do that.	Nayajj jupar ukham lurañapatakiw mayïna.
And he did no more than that.	Ukat janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
He doesn’t want any more.	Janiw juk’amp munkiti.
That’s what he learned.	Ukaw jupajj yateqäna.
He left it that way.	Jupax ukham jaytawayi.
I love it so much!!.	Nayax walpun munasta!!.
I would love to see more.	Jukʼamp uñjañ wal munta.
Well, he did it.	Ukhama, jupaw luratayna.
There is no kind of action.	Janiw kuna kasta lurañas utjkiti.
And that almost always means good questions.	Ukat ukajj niya sapa kutiw suma jisktʼanak sañ muni.
This was often necessary.	Ukajj walja kutiw wakisïna.
This speaks to two things.	Ukax pä tuqit arsu.
Tear.	Jach'a.
A new fresh air.	Mä machaq suma thaya.
Things happened in the morning.	Alwat kunanakas pasäna.
Or the first time, really.	Jan ukax nayrïr kuti, chiqpachansa.
But it’s not all bad.	Ukampis janiw taqpach jan walïkiti.
That would be obvious, then.	Ukajj qhanaw utjaspa, ukhamajj.
It’s really not very good.	Chiqpachansa janiw wali askïkiti.
Make him better.	Jupar jukʼamp sum luram.
Even the whole word.	Nayraqat taqpach aru.
It’s location, location, location.	Ukax kawkhans utji, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi.
What happens in the city!.	¡Kunas markanx pasaspa!.
We will do this every night.	Sapa arumaw uk lurañäni.
He’s just doing it.	Jupax ukhamakiw luraski.
Let's make a game out of it.	Uka tuqit mä anattʼañ lurañäni.
When he did so.	Kunapachatï ukham lurkäna ukhajja.
That seems like a good thing to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
He is and he isn’t.	Jupax ukhamawa ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to take care of this.	Nayax aka tuqit sum uñjañ munta.
And so it went on.	Ukat ukham sarnaqäna.
A little red.	Mä jisk’a wila.
He knew he would.	Ukham lurani uk jupajj sum yatïna.
See for yourself today.	Jichhürunakan juma pachpa uñjañäni.
He was absolutely right.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw säna.
I doubt he did that.	Ukham luratapat pächastwa.
He said he wanted to go home.	Utar sarañ munta sasaw säna.
If something happens, we have no control over it.	Kunas pasaspa ukhajja, janiw jiwasajj kuns lurañjamäkiti.
And it never will be.	Ukat janipuniw utjkaniti.
Make yourself a drink.	Juma pachpaw mä umañ lurañama.
He was obviously in a very bad mood.	Jupax qhanaw wali jan walin jikxatasïna.
Not a moment longer.	Janiw mä juk’a pachas juk’ampi.
So I never liked him.	Ukhamajj janipuniw jupar gustkituti.
Beyond that, it looks really, really good.	Ukat sipansa, chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali suma uñtatawa.
But before that, the eye feels good.	Ukampis janïr ukax nayrax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
I was carefully passive.	Nayajj wali amuyumpiw jan kuns lurayäta.
That’s exactly what you get.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jikxatasi.
It’s really exciting.	Chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
You are the only one who knows how to control him.	Juma sapakiw jupar apnaqañ yatta.
You want it badly.	Jumax jan waliw munta.
Please tell us a little bit.	Mä juk’a yatiyapxita.
He could barely get the words out.	Jupajj jukʼakiw uka arunak apsuñ puedkänti.
I gave it up that night.	Uka arumaw ukanak jaytawayta.
Of course, he doesn’t.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It wasn’t a party.	Janiw mä fiestan utjkänti.
He looks like that .	Jupajj ukham uñnaqaniwa .
They are not needed now.	Jichhajj janiw jupanakajj munaskiti.
No, but you need it.	Janiwa, ukampis jumajj ukaruw munasi.
Not again, he thought.	Janiw mayampsa, sasaw amuyäna.
I doubt it all took an hour.	Taqe kunas mä horaw pasäna sasaw pächasta.
He was very nice and friendly.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa ukat wali suma jaqënwa.
Whatever happens tomorrow.	Qhipürux kunas pasaspa.
But nobody knows anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.
He agreed, and that was it.	Jupajj iyaw sänwa, ukat ukhamänwa.
The annual .	Ukax sapa maraw .
It looks pretty cool.	Ukajj wali sumaw uñtasi.
That doesn’t mean it’s something you want to give up.	Ukax janiw kuntix jaytañ munkta ukax sañ munkiti.
In fact, it was really good.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
The who, what and why.	Uka khitis, kunas ukat kunatsa.
I’m still in love with it.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
Maybe that’s all you need.	Inas ukakiw wakisispa.
I will never go there again.	Janiw mayamps ukar sarkäti.
But yes, it does.	Ukampis jïsa, ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He certainly knows this fact.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheq yati.
Do what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk luram.
I miss you every day.	Nayax sapa uruw jumarux walpun munasta.
It’s the only one.	Ukax sapakiw utji.
No one goes home here.	Janiw khitis akan utar sarkiti.
But there was nothing else to do.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
That's the only thing that exists.	Ukajj ukakiw utji.
That’s what’s wrong.	Ukax kunatix jan walïki ukawa.
I just don't like it.	Nayajj janiw ukajj gustkituti.
I disagree with that.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet iyaw siskti.
I know this is hard for you.	Nayax yattwa akax jumatakix ch’amawa.
I know, he thought.	Nayax yattwa, sasaw amuyäna.
I want to take the heat off.	Nayax uka junt’u uma apsuñ munta.
He is a very rich man.	Jupax wali qamir jaqiwa.
Overall they are awesome.	Taqi kunat sipansa jupanakax wali muspharkañawa.
He was not what he wanted.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukhamäkänti.
And nothing to do about it.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas uka tuqitxa.
It matters who is doing better.	Khitis jukʼamp sum luraski ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He called the police.	Jupajj policiaruw jawsäna.
But all of this is irrelevant.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj janiw kunäkisa.
He said he was happy.	Jupajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw säna.
We need to do this quick.	Jiwasax aka jank’ak lurañaw wakisi.
I’m not saying he’s stupid.	Janiw nayax jupax llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukham siskti.
It doesn’t matter.	Ukax janiw kunäkisa.
That we are.	Uka jiwasax.
I let him, of course.	Nayax juparux jaytawayta, chiqpachansa.
I think that would be better.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juk’amp askïspawa.
Well, actually.	Suma, chiqpachansa.
I’m going, she said.	Nayax saraskta, sasaw jupax säna.
I came straight away.	Nayax chiqaw jutta.
And the reason I say that is absolutely true.	Ukat kunatsa ukham siskta ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
Faster, indeed.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp jankʼakiw.
He didn't mean it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti.
I’ve always done this stuff.	Nayax nayratpach uka lurañanak lurawayta.
I left him as well.	Nayax juparux ukhamarakiw jaytawayta.
It’s a money man.	Ukaxa qullqi jaqiwa.
That’s a little bit to say.	Ukax mä juk’a sañ muni.
This was every day.	Ukajj sapa uruw utjäna.
Do what is right for you.	Kunatï walïki uk luram.
I don’t have it word for word.	Nayax janiw arut arut ukax utjkituti.
He’s really nice.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
For one thing, it’s wrong.	Mä tuqitxa, janiw walïkiti.
It was a long strange night.	Mä jaya jan uñt’at arumaw utjäna.
They don’t have anything hot to do at any time.	Jupanakax janiw kuna pachas kuna junt’u lurañas utjkiti.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kun lurañsa yatkänti.
That night I gave it to the place.	Uka arumaw uka cheqan churta.
And, obviously no one can do it for that long.	Ukat, qhanaw jan khitis ukham jaya tiempox uk lurkaspati.
Not in the slightest.	Janiw mä jisk’a jisk’a jisk’a.
I was very happy to go.	Nayax wali kusisitaw sarawayta.
It did this for two main reasons.	Ukajj pä jachʼa chʼamampiw uk luräna.
So he made a decision.	Ukatwa mä amtar puri.
I don't see how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw uñjkti.
Do it the way you want.	Kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam luram.
But he seemed like such a great guy.	Ukampis jupajj ukham jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
It took a long time to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix walja tiempow munasïna.
There’s a good chance for you.	Jumatakix mä suma ch’amaw utji.
Let me know what you mean.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
But it needs to be done.	Ukampis lurañaw wakisi.
Is there such a thing?.	¿Ukham kunas utji?.
He wanted something like that, but more.	Jupajj ukham kunsa munäna, ukampis jukʼampiw munäna.
He doesn't know what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janiw yatkiti.
Didn't you	¿Janit jumax .
On the downside, maybe.	Uka jan wali tuqitxa, inas.
And he’s kind of right.	Ukat jupax mä juk’a chiqaw sañ muni.
After that, he felt better.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasïna.
It’s hard, but it’s fun.	Ukax ch’amawa, ukampis wali kusiskañawa.
Don’t be selfish.	Janiw juma pachpat jan walinak lurañamäkiti.
Or there was nothing.	Jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
We have more space.	Jiwasax juk’amp chiqaw utjistu.
He doesn't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkiti.
No one knows what happened inside.	Kunas manqhan pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He already knew that.	Jupax nayratpach uk yatïna.
That’s how I understand what you’re saying.	Ukhamaw nayax kuntix jumax siskta uk amuyayäta.
This stuff he took care of himself.	Aka yänak jupax jupa pachpaw uñjäna.
That is not really good.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun walïkiti.
We have everything you need here to do that.	Uka lurañatakix taqi kunatix wakiski ukanak akanx utjistu.
I think this is what you are seeing.	Nayax amuyta akax kuntix jumax uñjkta ukawa.
For the first time he saw her properly.	Nayrïr kutiw jupar sum uñjäna.
That was the first time it started working.	Ukaw nayrïr kutix irnaqañ qalltäna.
I want to know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiñ munta.
And he didn’t do anything.	Ukat jupax janiw kuns lurkänti.
It is, by the way, very common.	Ukax, ukhama, wali uñt’atawa.
It is the best thing ever.	Ukajj taqe kunat sipansa wali sumawa.
Lightweight and thin.	Llamp’u ukat jisk’a.
Hope to see you there!.	¡Ukan uñjañ suyt'askta!.
He just bought it here.	Jupax jichhakiw akan alasïna.
This won’t be another night.	Akax janiw yaqha arumax utjkaniti.
Tell me everything.	Taqi kun yatiyapxita.
Warm and warm.	Junt’u ukat junt’u.
And he saw only one.	Ukat mä sapakiw uñjäna.
Or about everything else.	Jan ukajj taqe kunatsa.
Do this every week or so.	Sapa semana jan ukajj jukʼampiw ukham lurañama.
I never knew who it was.	Janipuniw khitis uk yatkayätti.
Everything can be quiet.	Taqi kunas amukiw utjaspa.
I am very conscious of that.	Uka tuqitxa walpun amuyasta.
I never knew such a person existed.	Ukham jaqejj utjaspa uk janipuniw yatkayätti.
I hope that’s the case.	Nayax ukham suyt’ta.
When he looked, there was nothing there.	Uñchʼukiskäna ukhajja, janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
Here’s what that means.	Akax kunjams ukax sañ muni.
And we all have it.	Ukat taqiniw ukax utjistu.
You of course.	Jumax chiqpachansa.
Now he could see me again.	Jichhajj wasitatwa nayar uñjañ yatïna.
He did so with great vigour.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw ukham luräna.
He came to the table.	Jupax jutäna.
But he didn't think he could do it.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykänti.
There was only one.	Mä sapakiw utjäna.
It’s the first day of school.	Yatiqañ utan nayrïr uruw purini.
But he doesn’t know why.	Ukampis jupax janiw kunatsa ukham luraski uk yatkiti.
He preached to them for an hour.	Mä horaw jupanakar yatiyäna.
Almost no one knew, he said.	Niya janiw khitis yatkänti, sasaw jupajj säna.
Looks good so far, though.	Jichhakamax wali sumaw uñtasi, ukampis.
He wants to know everything.	Jupajj taqe kun yatiñ muni.
He knew a lot about building.	Jupajj uta lurañ toqet wal yatïna.
And you’ll feel the same way.	Ukat jumax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïta.
He is the one who controls it.	Jupaw ukanak apnaqi.
Nothing, he was saying.	Janiw kunas, sasaw jupajj siskäna.
He’s doing better, you know.	Jupax juk’amp sum luraski, jumax yatisktawa.
And it wasn't necessary.	Ukat janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
No, that's a good thing.	Janiwa, ukajj walikïskiwa.
That you’re not.	Ukax jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don’t want to go any further.	Nayax janiw juk’ampi sarañ munkti.
Beyond that, things are pretty cool.	Ukat sipansa, kunanakas wali sumawa.
But it felt good to hear that.	Ukampis uk istʼasajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
I can't find anything about that here.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns akan jikxatkti.
I don’t really know how good it feels.	Janiw chiqpachapunix kunjamsa suma jikxatasi ukxa yatkti.
He was friendly but self-conscious.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa ukampis jupa pachpaw amuyasïna.
That is more or less what he said.	Ukajj jukʼamp jan ukajj jukʼamp kuntï siskäna ukawa.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa sum yatkänti.
You’ve got to do it quickly.	Jumax jank’akiw lurañama.
And he left the place.	Ukat uka chiqat sarxäna.
It can be done.	Ukhamwa luraspa.
There’s nothing for me.	Janiw kunas nayatakix utjkiti.
I’ve seen it the same way.	Nayax ukhamarakiw uñjta.
We don’t like him.	Jiwasax janiw juparux gustkiti.
Somewhat unusual though.	Mä juk’a jan uñt’at ukhama.
It was clear that he really wanted to go.	Chiqpachansa sarañ muni, ukax qhanaw amuyasïna.
I came last.	Nayax qhip qhipa jutta.
But the other one wasn’t.	Ukampis maynix janiw ukhamäkänti.
Anything but what he’s supposed to do.	Kunas jan ukasti kuntix jupax lurañapäki ukawa.
These are not needed here.	Ukanakax janiw akanx munaskiti.
That’s how much time you have.	Ukhamaw qawqha tiempos utji.
I don't have much time.	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkituti.
He wants to know what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk yatiñ muni.
I kind of want a different guy.	Nayax mä juk’a yaqha waynaruw munta.
Of course I don’t care.	Chiqansa janiw nayax kuns lurkti.

Of course he is.	Chiqansa jupax ukhamawa.
But, for the first time, he understood it completely.	Ukampis, nayrïr kutiw taqpach amuyasïna.
So that’s the warmth.	Ukhama uka junt’u.
Needless to say, but he’s a great guy.	Janiw sañ munkti, ukampis jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
But maybe that's really necessary.	Ukampis inas ukajj cheqpachapun wakischispa.
But that didn't make sense to me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayarojj amuykayätti.
No one knows who he is.	Janiw khitis khitïnsa uk yatkiti.
I know how he is.	Nayajj kunjamsa jupajj uk yattwa.

Of course, everyone knows what this is really about.	Chiqansa, kuna tuqitsa ukax chiqpachapunix uk taqiniw yatipxi.
I wish I could, but I don’t.	Nayax ukhamawa sañ munta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I guess that is the point.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa sasaw amuyta.
I thought that was rather strange.	Ukajj jukʼamp muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
But I don’t think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuykti.

It’s fantastic in all honesty.	Taqi chiqanx wali muspharkañawa.

He wants it.	Jupajj uk muni.
In fact, he never really knew much about it.	Chiqansa, janipuniw chiqpachapunix walja tuqit sum yatkänti.

What does it mean to you.	Kunas jumatakix sañ muni.

I know they are important to you.	Nayax yattwa jupanakax jumatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
Or tell me something.	Jan ukajj kuns yatiyapjjeta.
That was the first thing he learned about it.	Ukaw nayraqat uka toqet yateqäna.
He didn't know she was watching him.	Jupajj jupar uñchʼukiskäna uk janiw yatkänti.

And he meant it.	Ukat jupax uk sañ munäna.
Not everyone knows everything.	Janiw taqenis taqe kun yatipkiti.
But he never does that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
That's something you don't want to do.	Ukajj janiw lurañ munktati.

I’ve been talking about it for a long time.	Walja pachaw uka tuqit arsuwayta.

He wanted to go with me, he said.	Jupax nayamp chika sarañ munäna, sasaw säna.
We’ll see what happens tomorrow.	Qhipürux kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
But he could never do that.	Ukampis janipuniw uk lurañ puedkänti.
It has everything you need.	Ukanjja, kunatï jumatak wakiski ukanakaw utji.
When he started.	Kunapachatï jupax qalltäna ukhaxa.
So he didn't want to leave her.	Ukhamajj janiw jupar jaytañ munkänti.
But that’s not the case for it.	Ukampis janiw ukatakix ukhamäkiti.
Actually, I’m pretty happy.	Chiqansa, nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Or he didn't do that.	Jan ukajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
It’s better for me.	Nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.

The old house was beautiful.	Nayra utax wali sumapunïnwa.
He says he didn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkti sasaw saraki.
You know what is right.	Kunatï walïki uk jumajj yatisktawa.
Someone already lives there.	Maynix niyaw ukan jakasi.

The first two things.	Nayrïr pä kuna.
No one there wants to see it now.	Ukanjja, janiw khitis jichhajj uñjañ munkiti.
He said no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp arskänti.
And I know that’s not a good thing.	Ukat nayax yattwa ukax janiw wali askïkiti.
That’s what I like right now.	Ukax nayatakix jichhax wali askiwa.
They know nothing about it.	Jupanakajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatipkiti.
We’ll do it in two ways.	Jiwasax pä tuqit lurañäni.
The guy was with me last night.	Uka waynax nayamp chikaw qhipa arumax utjäna.
Or that.	Jan ukajj uka.
Of course, there is no problem.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Because you have to, because it’s beautiful.	Kunatix jumax lurañamawa, kunatix wali sumawa.
He didn't know how to do it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkänti.
He loves this country.	Jupax aka markarux walpun munasi.
I can see why you would.	Kunatsa ukham lurasma uk sum uñjta.
I was terrified of it.	Nayajj wal ajjsarayäta.
Not any more, he says.	Janiw juk’ampi, sasaw saraki.
He still didn't understand.	Jupajj wali jan amuyaskänti.
I’m the only one who’s done it.	Naya sapakiw ukanak lurawayta.
What’s in it today?.	¿Kunas jichhürunakanx uka manqhan utji?.
I don’t want to know who he is.	Janiw khitïnsa uk yatiñ munkti.
Now you, you really don’t need money.	Jichhax jumax, chiqpachansa janiw qullqix munaskiti.
I don't know how long.	Janiw qawqha tiempos siskti.
I find this interesting and unique.	Nayatakix akax wali askiwa ukat jan uñt’atawa.
I don’t have that, anymore.	Nayax janiw ukax utjkituti, juk’ampi.
He saw an opportunity.	Jupajj mä oportunidad uñjäna.
No, on the other hand.	Janiwa, yaqha tuqitxa.
But that was not in time.	Ukampis ukajj janiw tiempon utjkänti.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa yatkti.
But if that happens, you'll be right.	Ukampis ukham pasani ukhajja, cheqapuniw säta.
He wants to go inside.	Jupajj utar mantañ muni.
There is no future.	Janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti.
And he says yes.	Ukat jupax jïsa sasaw saraki.
Do it again and again.	Uk mayamp luram.

Something no one really knows.	Kunatï jan khitis chiqpachapuni yatkaspa ukawa.
Good, good, he said.	Suma, suma, sasaw säna.
But he was in a hurry.	Ukampis jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I was so happy with how it turned out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk uñjasajj walpun kusista.
It doesn’t work for me.	Janiw nayatakix lurkiti.
What is the cause of this?.	¿Kunas ukham luraspa?.
Otherwise it is not.	Yaqha tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
I tried to do more.	Ukat jukʼamp lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He stayed in a class for three days.	Jupajj kimsa uruw mä clasen qheparäna.
A stranger maybe.	Mä jan uñt’at jaqix inas.
It’s well known.	Ukax suma uñt’atawa.
But I didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukham lurkänti.
So long .	Ukhama jaya .
All day and night.	Taqi uru arumaw.
Eventually, he agreed.	Qhepatjja, iyaw sänwa.
That’s really all there is to it.	Chiqpachansa ukakiw taqi kunas utji.
The question posed was whether it was worth doing.	Uka jisktʼajj akham sasaw jisktʼasïna: “Uka lurañajj walikïskiti janicha” sasa.
They had both.	Jupanakajj panpachaniw utjäna.
That was the question.	Uka jisktʼajj ukhamänwa.
But who thinks so.	Ukampis khitis ukham amuyi.
This is known as hunger.	Ukax manq’at awtjataw uñt’atawa.
This is the power.	Akax ch’amawa.
But now it's okay.	Ukampis jichhajj walikïskiwa.
Last night was that night.	Qhipa arumax uka arumaw utjäna.
Now let’s see what happens next.	Jichhax kunas jutïrin pasani uk uñjañäni.
This process can take years.	Uka lurañatakix walja maranakaw munasispa.
Not suitable for snow making.	Janiw ch’uqi ch’uqi lurañatakix askïkiti.
That’s what he wanted more.	Ukhamaw jupax juk’amp munäna.
Something wasn’t clear.	Kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
But I've only been there a few times.	Ukampis mä qhawqha kutikiw ukar sarawayta.
He gave him the money.	Jupajj qollqe churäna.
The first year is tough.	Nayrïr marax wali ch’amawa.
Will have to do more next time.	Jutïr kutin jukʼamp lurañaw wakisini.
There is no reason why he should.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa ukxa janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
They are good here.	Jupanakax akanx wali askiwa.
Or the next day.	Jan ukax qhipürux.
Or about three.	Jan ukajj niya kimsa.
He went back to sleep.	Jupax wasitat ikiñar sarxäna.

All of these, of course.	Taqi ukanakax, chiqpachansa.
It’s also a nice sight.	Ukhamaraki wali sumawa.

Also, slowly.	Ukhamaraki, ukhamaraki.
That’s another thing entirely.	Ukax yaqha tuqit taqpach.
And he knows exactly what to do.	Ukat kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
But where is he?.	Ukampis ¿kawkinsa jupajj jikjjatasi?.
Something was very wrong here.	Kunas akanx wali jan waliw utjäna.

But that doesn't mean doing nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan kun lurañ sañ munkiti.

A bad one.	Mä jan wali.

No, not yet.	Janiwa, janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
At the time, I didn't say anything.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kuns siskti.

They’re awesome, really.	Jupanakax wali muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.

No one does that today.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
It can happen all to yourself.	Ukajj juma pachpaw taqe kun pasaspa.

He refused to tell her why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa uk yatiyañ munkänti.

He knew all about it but couldn't tell anyone.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum yatïna ukampis janiw khitirus yatiyañ puedkänti.
If you think that’s awesome, good for you.	Jumatix amuyta ukax wali muspharkañawa, jumatakix wali askiwa.

That’s how it worked at the time.	Ukhamaw uka tiempon irnaqäna.

He didn't want to talk, he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Jupajj janiw parlañ munkänti, janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
He told me that.	Jupax ukham sasaw sitäna.
I don’t know how to do it.	Janiw kunjams lurañ yatkti.

This morning the rain will be heavy.	Jichha alwax jallux wali ch’amampiw purini.
That’s what you want, isn’t it.	Ukhamaw jumax munta, ¿janich ukhamäki.

Why.	Kunatsa.

He sees it very lonely.	Jupajj wali sapakiw uk uñji.

He really wanted her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar munäna.

I am still happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He wants it, he wants it.	Jupax muni, jupax muni.
You never know what could happen at that time.	Uka tiemponjja, kunas pasaspa uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
I hope it doesn’t.	Nayax suyt’twa janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now here’s what you want to know.	Jichhax akax kuntix jumax yatiñ munkta ukawa.
I'm sorry for him.	Jupat llakistwa.
There’s something about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunas utji.
But he was still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
It doesn't seem like it's possible.	Janiw ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He didn’t know what to say to her.	Janiw kuns jupar sañ yatkänti.
That’s why things are like this.	Ukatwa kunanakas ukham utji.
So he said he would never do that.	Ukatwa janipuniw ukham lurkäti sasaw säna.
Let's take a closer look at him.	Jupat jukʼamp sum uñjañäni.
I did that, if you will.	Nayax uk lurawayta, jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
I don't want it any more than you do.	Nayajj janiw jumanakat sipansa jukʼamp munkti.
But he doesn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw jupajj kuns lurkiti.
I’ve done the following.	Nayax akham lurawayta.
There is not much time left.	Ukanjja, janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
Just as he was supposed to do.	Kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhama.
Want to learn more?.	¿Juk’amp yatxatañ munasmati?.
He wanted to know.	Jupajj yatiñwa munäna.
He felt good for the first time in days.	Jupajj urunak qhepatjja, nayrïr kutiw wali sum jikjjatasïna.
You make a snowflake.	Jumax mä ch’uqi ch’uqi lurasma.
I’ve done this for you.	Nayaw aka lurawayta.
A few more, a few more.	Mä qawqha juk’ampi, mä qawqha juk’ampi.
But they’re worth it!.	Ukampis ¡jupanakax wali askiwa!.
Something happened this year that you rarely see.	Jichha marax kunas pasäna, kunatix juk’akiw uñjasi.
Someone doesn’t do this.	Maynix janiw aka tuqitx lurkiti.
That's what he did.	Ukajj jupaw luräna.
But I can't imagine why he wouldn't.	Ukampis kunatsa jan uk lurañ munkaspa uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
That’s exactly what he seemed to be doing tonight.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kuntix jupax jichha arumax luraskäna ukhama.
A few more days and it doesn’t matter.	Mä qawqha urunak juk’ampi ukat janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I feel comfortable in that area.	Nayax uka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
Nothing but snow.	Janiw kunas jan ukasti ch’uqi.
He didn't have a he.	Jupajj janiw mä jupajj utjkänti.
They had everything.	Jupanakajj taqe kunaw utjäna.
I want to know everything that is happening in this country today.	Jichhürunakanx taqi kunatix aka markan luraski ukanak yatiñ munta.
I don’t drink now.	Jichhax janiw umañ munkti.
But the more he looked, the more he saw.	Ukampis jukʼamp uñchʼukiskäna ukhajja, jukʼampiw uñjäna.
That’s what it means.	Ukaw sañ muni.
But he was the only one who saw her.	Ukampis jupa sapakiw jupar uñjäna.
So far that’s it.	Jichhakamax ukax ukhamawa.
He has to do the work.	Jupaw uka lurañanak lurañapa.
So he did just that.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamwa luräna.
Now it’s very important.	Jichhax wali wakiskiriwa.
Tell me what is wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk yatiyapxita.
He went to his bedroom.	Jupajj ikiñ utaparuw saräna.
So we’re them.	Ukhamaw jiwasax jupanakar.
These were not necessary.	Ukanakajj janiw wakiskänti.
I really don’t drink much beer.	Chiqpachansa janiw sinti cerveza umañ yatkti.
And it’s kind of weird.	Ukat mä kasta muspharkañawa.
It actually looks better.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp sumaw uñtasi.
First things first.	Nayrïr kunanakas nayraqat.
Just do it!.	Luram!.
It’s a nice sight!.	¡Ukajj wali sumawa!.
Or both .	Jan ukajj panpachaniw .
Make things better for yourself.	Juma pachpaw kuns sum lurañama.
I didn’t know anything about him.	Janiw jupat kuns yatkayätti.
Things are still beautiful.	Kunanakas wali sumawa.
It’s a warm night.	Mä junt’u arumaw.
You’ve said it yourself many times.	Juma pachpaw walja kuti ukham sista.
That’s what he was doing.	Ukham luraskäna.
He really wanted to get in there.	Jupajj uka cheqar mantañ wal munäna.
Instead, you have to do something.	Jan ukasti, kuns lurañamawa.
He almost did it.	Jupajj niyaw ukham luräna.
I didn't know it at the time, but it was.	Uka tiemponjja janiw uk yatkayätti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
I think they’re pretty cool.	Nayax jupanakax wali sumaw sasaw amuyta.
I never really got a chance.	Janipuniw chiqpachansa mä oportunidad jikxatkti.
That person doesn’t have it in him at that moment.	Uka jaqix janiw uka pachanx jupan utjkiti.
But there’s something there, after all.	Ukampis kunas ukan utji, taqi kunat sipansa.
He is obviously.	Jupajj qhanawa.
He stayed there for two weeks.	Jupajj pä semanaw ukan qheparäna.
And you will agree that what he wants is right.	Ukat kuntï jupajj munki ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw iyaw säta.
It feels a little better.	Mä juk’a suma jikxatasi.
That’s not what I like.	Ukax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
I don't want to see you.	Janiw nayajj jumar uñjañ munkti.
Which he always had.	Ukajj jupajj sapa kutiw utjäna.
It took me a while to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj mä qhawqha tiempow munasïna.
I worked hard for it.	Ukatakejj wal chʼamachasiyäta.
You’re really enjoying it.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastaxa.
Now that's fine.	Jichhajj ukajj walikïskiwa.
I’ve been there a few times but never again.	Mä qawqha kutiw ukar sarawayta ukampis janipuniw mayampsa sarkti.
It doesn’t really work.	Janiw chiqpachapunix irnaqkiti.
And again he refused.	Ukat wasitatwa jupajj jan munkänti.
And after that year.	Ukat uka mara qhepatjja.
Those are the issues.	Ukanakaw uka tuqitxa.
I’ve enjoyed it so far.	Nayax jichhakamax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
It really felt that way.	Chiqpachansa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I thought about how I felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.
Something like that.	Kunas ukham uñt’atawa.
Much, well, much less.	Walja, wali, juk’ampi jisk’a.
It was your one time.	Ukajj jumanakan mä kutikiw utjäna.

I feel that way now.	Jichhajj ukham jikjjatasta.
I did a good job there.	Ukanjja, mä suma trabajo lurawayta.
¡New look!.	¡Machaq uñtatawa!.
I didn't do anything about it for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw uka toqet kuns lurkti.
It is something he could do.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj luraspäna ukawa.
I won't do it now.	Nayajj janiw jichhajj lurkäti.
I don’t get what he was then and what I am now.	Nayax janiw jikxatkti kunas jupax uka pachax ukat kunas nayax jichhax.
What he says today.	Kuntï jichhürunakan siski ukajja.
That didn't really surprise me.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun muspharkayätti.
I feel a little better now.	Jichhax mä juk’a sumaw jikxatastxa.
As much as he needs to.	Kunjamtï jupajj wakiski ukhama.
I wonder what is going on.	Kunas pasaski sasaw jisktʼasta.
He doesn't know what to say next.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jutïrin sañ yatkiti.
You can do this on your own.	Ukajj juma pachpaw lurasma.
He never wanted to remove it.	Jupajj janipuniw uk apsuñ munkänti.
I said there was no food.	Nayax janiw manq’añax utjkiti sasaw sista.
Still walking around, maybe.	Wali ch’amampiw sarnaqäna, inas.
But the reality is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kunatï pasaski ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And let's look at these more.	Ukat ukanak jukʼamp uñjañäni.
It was the middle of winter.	Ukajj chika juyphi pachaw utjäna.
But that doesn't mean we have nothing to do with it.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jiwasatak kuna lurañas utjkiti sañ munkiti.
You have to make it a little easier.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amampiw lurañama.
Or well, for that matter.	Jan ukax suma, uka tuqitxa.
Three years, that’s right.	Kimsa mara, ukhama.
I decided that was what was needed.	Ukaw wakisi sasaw amtawayta.
He wants to be careful, she thought.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqañ muni, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Everything went fast after that.	Uka qhepatjja, taqe kunas jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
I didn’t want to, ever again.	Janiw munkayätti, janipuniw mayampsa.
Whatever you do, big or small.	Kuns lurasma, jach’a jisk’a.
He terrorizes this country.	Jupax aka markarux axsarayi.
These are called rain.	Ukanakax jallu satawa.
Then he turned back to me.	Ukat nayaruw kuttʼjjäna.
That means it will take time.	Ukajj tiempow munasini sañ muni.
It was human, at least.	Ukajj jaqënwa, mä jukʼa.
i don't know what to do.	nayax janiw yatkti.
I wonder if he knows about it.	Jupajj uka toqet yatpachati sasaw jisktʼasta.
He came when he planned.	Jupax kunapachatï amtkäna ukhaw jutäna.
I want to do that because.	Nayax ukham lurañ munta kunatix.
You can do a whole lot of things.	Mä taqpach lurañanak lurañaw wakisispa.
But I don't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañ munkti.
That was what he was looking at.	Ukaw jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.
He said something soft.	Jupax mä llamp’u arunak arsüna.
Anyone can do that.	Khitis ukham luraspawa.
Every day is a new day.	Sapa uruw mä machaq uru.
I love you and I love you so much.	Nayax jumarux walpun munasta ukat walpun munasta.
I'm not sure why he didn't.	Kunatsa jan ukham lurkäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
That was about it.	Ukajj uka toqetwa parläna.
It’s a nice guy.	Mä suma jaqiwa.
But I know the truth.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki uk yattwa.
He wants to eat again.	Jupax wasitat manq’añ muni.
He assured me that there was no problem.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti sasaw sitäna.
All the facts are completely clear.	Taqe kunatï cheqäki ukajj qʼala qhanawa.
There was no one who was.	Janiw khitis khitis utjkänti.
I don't like it any more than you do.	Nayajj janiw jumat sipansa jukʼamp gustkituti.
Or why not.	Jan ukajj kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
So that's pretty amazing to me.	Ukhamajj ukajj nayatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
And he asked the question.	Ukat sasaw jisktʼäna.
I just don’t agree with that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitxa iyaw sañjamäkiti.
So old.	Ukhama nayra.
But it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
He has everything I have.	Jupajj taqe kunaw nayan utjitu.
Strange, he thought.	Muspharkañawa, sasaw amuyäna.
No one knows exactly how that will turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
He had just arrived home.	Jupajj jichhakiw utar purinïna.
I saw him once.	Mä kutiw jupar uñjta.
And never give up.	Ukat janipuniw jaytañamäkiti.
Very cold water.	Wali thaya uma.
That’s what I don’t want.	Ukax nayax janiw munkti.
Somehow that doesn’t matter, either.	Kunjamatsa ukax janiw kunäkisa, ukhamaraki.

He was silent.	Jupajj amukiw jikjjatasïna.
That’s unfamiliar to me.	Ukax nayatakix jan uñt’atawa.
Now you might have to do that.	Jichhajj inas ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
But it did itself.	Ukampis ukajj jupa pachpaw luräna.

And so we need to do this.	Ukat ukhamaw jiwasax aka lurañax wakisi.
This is more important than that.	Ukajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
I want to get out there, and I want to do it now.	Nayax uka chiqat mistuñ munta, ukat jichhax uk lurañ munta.
That’s where I like it.	Ukanx nayatakix wali askiwa.
To be honest, I heard that myself.	Chiqpachansa, naya pachpaw uka arunak istʼta.

I want to get the book.	Nayax uka libro apsuñ munta.
And that’s exactly what he wanted.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax munäna.
But he never said anything about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet kuns siskänti.
I used to want to do it so soon.	Nayrajj ukham jankʼak lurañwa munta.

But he’s a nice guy.	Ukampis jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
Surprisingly, no one seemed interested.	Muspharkañawa, janis khitis uka tuqit yatxatañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.

And then you want that to happen really quickly.	Ukat ukat ukax chiqpachansa jankʼakiw lurasiñap munta.

Someone is doing this.	Maynix aka luraski.
Yes, he said he knew it.	Jïsa, jupajj uk sum yatïna sasaw säna.
Except for once, maybe.	Jan ukasti mä kutikiw, inas.
Some action is clearly needed.	Mä juk’a lurañax qhanaw wakisi.
Better than you, a lot.	Jumat sipansa juk’amp askiwa, walja.
You know, the food.	Jumax yatisktawa, manq’a.
That is never the case.	Ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.

I love you so much.	Wali munasma.
But there is only one.	Ukampis mä sapakiw jikjjatasi.
I know what is going on.	Kunas pasaski uk sum yatta.
He didn't like the way the boy gave orders.	Kunjamsa uka waynax kamachinak churäna ukax janiw juparux gustkänti.
I’m sorry, but that’s it.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis ukax ukhamawa.
In the past.	Nayra tiemponjja.

So what does that mean.	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa ukajj sañ muni.
I know that is him.	Ukajj jupaw uk yattwa.
I didn’t really find many.	Janiw chiqpachansa walja jikxatkti.
There was nothing more to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kunas ukat sipan jukʼamp utjkänti.
I hope you like it as well.	Nayax suyt’twa jumanakax kunjamtï lurapkta ukhama.
So he went alone.	Ukatwa sapaki sarjjäna.
I have no idea what is wrong.	Nayajj janiw kunas jan walïki uk amuykti.
It’s very, very difficult.	Ukax wali, wali ch’amawa.

But now.	Ukampis jichhajj.
No, but it’s okay.	Janiwa, ukampis walikïskiwa.
This is not what you want.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkiti.
I can’t stand this house.	Nayax janiw aka utax aguantañjamäkiti.
But not for you, obviously.	Ukampis jumatakix janiw ukhamäkiti, qhanawa.
That’s actually, it is.	Ukax chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.

I am really looking forward to playing with him.	Chiqpachansa jupamp anattʼañ wal suyaskta.
But he was a happy man.	Ukampis kusisit jaqënwa.
He stayed with her for a few years.	Mä qawqha maranakaw jupamp qheparäna.
He didn't know exactly where to go.	Jupajj kawkirus sarañapa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
But that’s not the case here.	Ukampis aka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkiti.
Strange because there wasn’t.	Muspharkañawa kunatix janiw utjkänti.
But otherwise, we have to do it alone.	Ukampis jan ukajja, sapakiw ukanak lurañasa.
It was exactly what he wanted.	Ukajj kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamänwa.
Yes, or the other way around.	Jïsa, jan ukajj yaqha tuqitxa.
No one wants to drive too much.	Janiw khitis sinti auto apnaqañ munkiti.
This time he came alone.	Jichha kutix sapakiw jutäna.

It's waiting for you.	Ukax jumaruw suyt'aski.

There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha lurañas utjkaspati.
Now, or never.	Jichhax, jan ukax kunapachas.
But that first day doesn’t work.	Ukampis uka nayrïr urux janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I’m sure that’s okay.	Nayax yatxatwa ukax walikïskiwa.
He felt he had to do it with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw lurañapa sasaw amuyasïna.
I know exactly what he is saying.	Kuntï jupajj cheqpachapun siski uk sum yatta.
I don't know where he got the money.	Kawkitsa uka qollqe apsüna uk janiw yatkti.
I would rather not.	Nayajj jan ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
He didn't want to give up.	Jupajj janiw jaytañ munkänti.
And really, that’s good.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax wali askiwa.
When, of course, it wasn’t.	Kunapachatï, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Before I ever did that before.	Nayrajj nayrajj ukham lurapkta ukanakat sipansa.
Instead, you came to me.	Jan ukasti, jumaw nayar jutta.
Last night was the last night.	Qhipa arumax qhipa arumaw utjäna.
He doesn’t know what’s in there.	Jupax janiw kunas ukan utjki uk yatkiti.
I just saw that.	Nayax jichhakiw uk uñjta.
And then he wanted to do well.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, sum lurañwa munäna.
I don't want to know any more.	Janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkti.
Not everything is possible.	Janiw taqi kunas utjkaspati.
I will do it once, and never again.	Mä kutikiw ukham lurä, ukat janipuniw mayampsa lurkäti.
I’m looking for more work.	Nayax juk’amp irnaqañ thaqhaskta.
John felt the same way.	Juanajj ukhamarakiw amuyäna.
But I don't know what to do.	Ukampis kunsa lurañajäki uk janiw yatkti.
And there really is no problem.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He seemed to already know this.	Jupax nayratpach uk yatkaspa ukham amuyasïna.
I can't think of anyone who does it better.	Janiw khitirus jukʼamp sum lurañapatak amuytʼirjamäkti.
I could never imagine that.	Janipuniw ukham amuytʼirjamäkti.
A few days later, he called to say he wanted the book.	Mä qawqha urunak qhepatjja, uka libro munta sasaw jawsäna.
Let’s see where he is now.	Jichhax kawkhans jikxatasi uk uñjañäni.
He doesn’t go to school.	Jupax janiw yatiqañ utar sarkiti.
I made myself a big drink.	Naya pachpaw mä jachʼa umañ lurayäta.

Not so much, he said.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupajj säna.
It’s time to make a decision.	Ukax mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
He had no idea who he was or where he lived.	Jupajj khitïnsa, kawkhansa jakasi uk janiw amuykänti.
Other than that, there was nothing.	Ukanakat sipansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He wanted to move.	Jupax yaqha chiqar sarxañ munäna.

A little slow.	Mä juk’a llamp’u.
All of these are rare.	Taqi ukanakax juk’akiw utji.

That’s because it doesn’t exist.	Ukax kunatix janiw utjkiti.
He barely asked me anything.	Jupajj jukʼakiw kunsa jisktʼitäna.
It’s a little harder now, but still.	Jichhax mä juk’a ch’amawa, ukampis wali ch’amawa.
And he didn't like that.	Ukat janiw uk jupajj gustkänti.
So you can't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
Even more than I do.	Nayat sipansa juk’ampi.
I haven't seen him.	Nayajj janiw jupar uñjkti.
I know he thought he was right.	Nayax yattwa, jupax chiqaw sasaw amuyäna.
He thought it was obvious.	Jupajj qhanaw sasaw amuyäna.
And if we don’t, there’s something terribly wrong indeed.	Ukat jan ukham lurañäni ukhaxa, chiqpachansa wali axsarkañ jan waliw utji.
It’s too early for that now.	Jichhax ukatakix wali nayraw.

How cool is that.	Kunjamsa ukajj wali thaya.

And he started it.	Ukat jupaw qalltäna.

He said it looked better.	Jupax juk’amp sumaw uñjasi sasaw säna.
He wanted to know everything that had happened.	Jupajj taqe kunatï paskäna uk yatiñwa munäna.

He wanted this man.	Jupax aka jaqiruw munäna.
And then he spoke.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jupajj parläna.
He knew he was the last one.	Jupajj qhep qhepa jaqëtap sum yatïna.

Well, at least this is it.	Ukhama, mä juk’a akax ukhamawa.
I didn't know it would be done soon.	Janiw jankʼak lurasiñap yatkti.

But often this is not the case.	Ukampis walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.

It’s either you’re good or bad or both.	Ukax jumax wali suma jan ukax jan wali jan ukax panpachaniw jikxatastaxa.

No one wants to talk to me.	Janiw khitis nayamp parlañ munkiti.
I can't believe it happened.	Ukajj pasäna uk janiw creykti.

This is something you have to do yourself.	Akax juma pachpaw lurañama.

Or he was that way.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukhamänwa.
It is what we do.	Ukajj kuntï lurapkta ukawa.
He would do it first thing in the morning.	Jupajj nayrïr kutiw alwajj uk luraspäna.
So there was no one.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
He did this for three hours.	Jupajj kimsa horanakaw ukham luräna.
I’ve done it all.	Nayax taqpach lurawayta.
It’s a very busy day.	Uka urux wali ch’amawa.
He had no one to do anything with.	Jupajj janiw khitirus kuns lurañapatak utjkänti.
It arrived beautifully.	Ukajj wali sumaw purinïna.

It’s pretty cool, too.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, ukhamaraki.

So do everything you can.	Ukhamajj taqe kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañamawa.
I want to do something about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañwa munta.
And you know, that’s what I like.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
What is the cost required? 	¿Kuna qullqis munasispa?
A great deal more.	Mä jach’a juk’ampi.
He had always done that.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham luräna.
There is silence.	Ukanx amukiw utji.
No one wanted to play with me.	Janiw khitis nayamp anattʼañ munkänti.
He wants to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa muni.
He was once like that.	Jupax mä kutix ukhamänwa.
He was never like this before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.

And so is mine.	Ukat nayan ukhama.
He was in the country.	Jupajj uka markanwa jikjjatasïna.
In this respect, it is actually fine.	Uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa walikïskiwa.
So I gave it up.	Ukatwa ukanak jaytawayta.
It’s actually really hot.	Chiqansa chiqpachansa wali junt’u.
He studied her for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jupat yateqäna.
That means work.	Ukajj irnaqañ sañ muni.

He says he doesn’t have to walk.	Jupax janiw kayuk sarañax wakiskiti sasaw saraki.

Now, we’ll do it.	Jichhax, jiwasax lurañäni.
As much as we can do it.	Kunjamtï jiwasajj lurañjamäki ukhama.

You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw lurasma.
You can do better!.	¡Jumajj jukʼamp sum lurasma!.
No one knew what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkänti.
So there is no need to do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’s a really awesome guy.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ waynawa.
I’ve been doing it once a week for years.	Walja maranakaw semanan mä kuti luraskta.
But let’s look at the facts.	Ukampis kunanakas cheqpach utji uk uñjañäni.
You’re really in a bad mood.	Chiqpachansa jan walin jikxatastaxa.
He could not go to the hospital.	Jupajj janiw hospitalar sarañ puedkänti.
That’s what it felt like.	Ukaw ukham amuyasïna.
I look forward to more from you.	Jumanakat jukʼamp suytʼaskta.
In fact, they .	Chiqansa, jupanakax .
Don’t miss this opportunity.	Janiw aka oportunidad jaytañamäkiti.
I never wanted anyone more.	Janipuniw khitirus jukʼamp munkayätti.
It’s very difficult at the moment.	Jichha pachanx wali ch’amaw jikxatasi.

But after that.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja.
The first time it didn’t matter.	Nayrïr kutix janiw ukax wakiskänti.
I told him it was the same thing.	Nayax juparux mä pachpaw sasaw sista.
No one wanted to do it.	Janiw khitis uk lurañ munkänti.
So it's pretty obvious.	Ukhamajj wali qhanawa.
I thought it was a lot of fun.	Nayajj wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
After that, it happened fairly quickly.	Uka qhepatjja, mä jukʼa jankʼakiw pasäna.
That doesn't appeal to me.	Ukajj janiw nayatak askïkiti.
That would be better.	Ukaw jukʼamp askïspa.
And for that.	Ukat ukatakix.
That was the only thing that was good.	Ukakiw wali sumapunïnwa.
Now ten years later.	Jichhajj tunka mara qhepatwa.

And that’s pretty cool.	Ukat ukax wali ch’amawa.
Let me know how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk yatiyapjjeta.
I wasn't surprised at all.	Janiw nayajj kunjamatsa muspharkayätti.
He said he didn't know how he got there.	Kunjamsa uka cheqar purini uk janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
He had been doing this for years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw ukham luraskäna.
I never did that.	Janipuniw uk lurkti.
Yours is the only one.	Juman sapakiw utji.
He is just doing it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraski.
It actually feels good.	Chiqansa ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He knew a lot about her that night.	Jupajj uka arumaw jupat wali sum yatïna.

You where wrong.	Jumax kawkhans jan wali.
Yeah, that seems like a good thing.	Jïsa, ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayi.
Or where this is.	Jan ukax kawkhans akax utji.
I never said that.	Janipuniw uk siskti.
Something bigger than me.	Nayat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa kuna.
He feels the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasi.
Don’t forget about it.	Uka tuqit jan armasimti.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He loved it when he did it.	Ukham lurasajj walpun munasïna.
So there is no time.	Ukhamajj janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
I give him what he wants.	Nayax kuntix jupax munki uk churta.
It feels quiet.	Ukajj amukiw jikjjatasi.
There was never any.	Janipuniw kunapachas utjkänti.
I don’t know where I’m doing it wrong.	Janiw kawkhansa jan walinak luraskta uk yatkti.
And this is good enough.	Ukat akax wali askiwa.
Also of course.	Ukhamaraki chiqpachansa.
He came to the house one day.	Jupajj mä uruw uka utar jutäna.
I hope this is better for me.	Nayax suyt’twa, akax nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.
He’s quick, he’s big.	Jupax jank’akiw, jach’a jaqiwa.
I’d like to see some of it.	Nayax mä juk’a uñjañ munta.
Somehow he did it.	Kunjamatsa jupax luratayna.
Yeah, that was pretty good.	Jïsa, ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
That would be more effective.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askïspawa.
But that is surprising .	Ukampis ukajj muspharkañawa .
This is not available.	Akax janiw utjkiti.
No one knows what happened after that.	Uka qhepatjja, kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But he said yes to it.	Ukampis jupajj jïsa sasaw säna.
I asked him why he thought he would do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurani sasin amuyta sasaw jisktʼta.
I don’t like this plane.	Nayax janiw aka avión ukarux gustkituti.
I’ve seen the photos.	Nayax fotonak uñjta.
So nothing more needs to be done.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp lurañajj wakiskiti.
No, actually, not at all.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was nothing there.	Janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.

The point was very clear.	Uka tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
And about yourself.	Ukat juma pachpat.
He refused to go there.	Jupajj uka cheqar sarañ janiw munkänti.
It’s my first year here.	Aka chiqanx nayrïr maraw jikxatasi.
He’s in a very uncomfortable position.	Jupax wali jan walin jikxatasi.
I didn’t go to the hospital.	Janiw hospitalar sarkti.
Something like that.	Mä kunas ukham.

And it’s not the first time.	Ukat janiw nayrïr kutis ukhamäkiti.
It’s always there.	Ukax sapa kutiw utji.

But still, what you say is valid.	Ukampis walikïskiwa, kuntï siskta ukajj walikïskiwa.

He’s everything you want him to be.	Jupax taqi kunatix jumax munkta ukawa.

But it looks bad.	Ukampis jan wali uñnaqaniwa.

But that doesn't mean anything will happen.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunas pasani sañ munkiti.
He said he would drive there once a month.	Phaxsin mä kutiw uka chiqar autot sarä sasaw säna.
That's what he's doing.	Ukajj jupajj luraski.

The more you do it, the more you do.	Walja kuti lurasax jukʼampiw lurañama.
But he remained silent, saying nothing.	Ukampis amukiw qheparäna, janiw kuns arskänti.
I’m just doing it.	Nayax ukhamakiw luraskta.
Of course one was.	Chiqansa maynix ukhamänwa.

It’s pretty obvious what’s wrong.	Kunas jan walïki ukax wali qhanawa.
But there’s nothing there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
He kept his eyes fixed on me.	Jupajj nayaruw nayranakap sum uñchʼukiskäna.
Pretty much exactly what you want.	Niya chiqpachapuniw kuntix jumax munkta ukhama.
It has nothing to do with me, one way or the other.	Janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti, mä tuqit jan ukax yaqha tuqit.

That’s what the guy did.	Ukhamaw uka waynax luräna.

And no, there’s nothing much you can do about it.	Ukat janiw, janiw kunas uka tuqit sinti lurañax utjkiti.

Now he didn't care.	Jichhajj janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.

He’s as good as anyone.	Jupax khitirus uñtasit wali sumaw jikxatasi.

No, of course, it is.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
Last time it took a while.	Qhipa kutix mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.

And he means it.	Ukat jupax uk sañ muni.
However, this is often impossible.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj walja kutiw jan lurañjamäkiti.

And he rubbed his eyes.	Ukat nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.

He didn't want anything to happen to him.	Jupajj janiw kunas jupar pasañap munkänti.
It was all very quiet at night.	Taqi ukanakax wali arumax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
I knew no one would ever do that.	Janiw khitis janipuniw ukham lurkaspati uk sum yatiyäta.
Old, but very good.	Nayra, ukampis wali sumawa.
I knew nothing about money.	Janiw qollqe toqet kuns yatkayätti.
But it is worth doing.	Ukampis uk lurañajj wali askiwa.
I don't know what it is.	Janiw kunas ukajj uk yatkti.
I barely heard him.	Jupar jukʼakiw istʼta.
It’s a great guy.	Mä jach’a jaqiwa.
I didn’t really expect that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham suykayätti.

And it takes a while.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
I’m from that country.	Nayax uka markat jutta.

He knew better than she did.	Jupajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatïna.

Every night and every night.	Sapa arumaw ukat sapa arumax.
And of course it doesn’t.	Ukat chiqansa janiw ukhamäkiti.

I decided to stay there.	Ukan qhiparañ amtawayta.
And he’s waiting now.	Ukat jupax jichhax suyt’aski.
He lives there, all right.	Jupax ukan jakasi, walikïskiwa.
I’ve seen him twice.	Nayax pä kutiw jupar uñjta.
That was clearly not the case here.	Ukajj janiw aka cheqan utjkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
No problem ever said that.	Janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis ukham arskänti.
Everything was about him.	Taqi kunaw jupat utjäna.

That’s pretty common right now.	Ukax jichhax wali uñt’atawa.
It's a thing of the past.	Mä kunaw ukajja.
He thought it would take three days.	Kimsa uruw pasaspa sasaw amuyäna.
These are obviously not the case.	Ukanakajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
He didn’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurkänti.
There was still plenty of time.	Wali walja tiempow utjäna.
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
He can only be in one place at a time.	Jupajj mä cheqan mä kutikiw utjaspa.
Not so, he told himself.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
I am very concerned about all of this.	Taqe ukanakat walpun llakista.
I haven’t had that in years.	Walja maranakaw ukham jan jikxatkti.

It was kind of like, you know.	Mä juk’a ukhamänwa, jumax yatisktawa.
He did what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk luräna.
Now it's better.	Jichhax juk'amp askiwa.
I will do it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurä.
You have to do this alone.	Ukxa sapakiw lurañama.
I left it somewhere .	Nayax kawkhans jaytawayta .
He said nothing of importance.	Jupajj janiw kuna wakiskir kunsa arskänti.
And so it was here.	Ukat ukhamarakiw akanx utjäna.
He wanted to know and he didn’t want to know.	Jupax yatiñ munäna ukat janiw yatiñ munkänti.
We will do it tomorrow.	Jiwasajj qharüruw lurañäni.
There’s nothing new there.	Ukanx janiw kunas machaq utjkiti.

All of these things need to be done.	Taqi ukanak lurañaw wakisi.

He just knew that.	Jupajj ukhamakiw yatïna.
I don’t have anywhere else to go.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax utjkituti.
So you have agreed.	Ukhamajj jumajj iyaw satawa.
I don’t have much time.	Janiw walja tiemponïkti.
This is the hardest and most important.	Akax juk’amp ch’amawa ukat juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
He doesn't do that for you.	Jupajj janiw jumatak ukham lurkiti.
He lived his life like that.	Jupajj ukhamwa jakasïna.
Well, he thought.	Ukhamawa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I want to reiterate that.	Nayax uka tuqit wasitat arsuñ munta.

Everything he doesn’t have is important.	Taqi kunatix jupar jan utjki ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
It felt like a good idea.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyasïna.
I never did, not really.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, janiw chiqpachansa.
When he got there, he turned back to her.	Ukar purisajj wasitatwa jupar kuttʼjjäna.
I thought it was wonderful.	Nayajj wali sumapunïnwa sasaw amuyayäta.
And maybe again.	Ukat inas mayampsa.
I would have to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisispa.
But really .	Ukampis chiqpachansa .
There’s never been anything quite like this.	Janipuniw kunas ukham taqpach utjkänti.
So what does it matter.	Ukhamajj kunas ukajj wakisispa.
But how do you do that?.	Ukampis ¿kunjamsa uk lurasma?.
It rubbed off on me.	Ukajj nayamp chikaw chʼalljjtayasïna.

And that takes time.	Ukat ukatakix tiempow munasispa.
No one knows at home.	Janiw khitis utan yatkiti.
I am really sorry about that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa llakistwa.
A rather large amount.	Mä juk’a jach’a qullqi.

That’s a good boy.	Ukax mä suma waynawa.

He had done something wrong and he knew it.	Jupajj jan walinak luratayna ukat uk sum yatïna.
But it wasn’t necessary.	Ukampis janiw wakiskänti.
It happened again.	Ukajj wasitatwa pasäna.
I think he feels the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasi sasaw amuyta.
I don’t know where to go.	Nayax janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkti.
Thank you so much in advance!.	¡Nayratpachaw walpun yuspärta!.
He won’t care, of course.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkaniti, chiqpachansa.
He just stared and walked away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw uñchʼukiskäna ukat sarjjäna.
No one has to do it all alone.	Janiw khitis sapakix taqi ukanak lurañapäkiti.
I kind of think this is okay.	Nayax mä juk’a amuyasta akax walikïskiwa.
And to me that means something.	Ukat nayatakix ukax mä kuns sañ muni.

He was more than happy about it.	Jupajj ukat jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

And that’s yes.	Ukat ukax jïsa.
And the last one.	Ukat qhip qhipa.

I know he’s good for you.	Nayax yattwa jupax jumatakix wali askiwa.
How he behaved.	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna.
He was silent now.	Jupax jichhax amukiw jikxatasïna.
I wasn’t that surprised.	Janiw ukham muspharkayätti.
This is something that needs to be done!.	¡Akax mä lurañaw wakisi!.
Very beer-like.	Wali cerveza ukham uñt’atawa.

But he had never been able to do that before.	Ukampis janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañ puedkänti.
Maybe you can do better.	Inas jumax jukʼamp sum lurasma.
But no one could go.	Ukampis janiw khitis sarañ puedkänti.

Nothing he doesn’t know.	Janiw kunas jupax jan yatkiti.
He knew how to drink.	Jupax umañ yatïna.

So it was all good.	Ukhamajj taqe kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
Everything depends on it.	Taqi kunas ukaruw uñtasi.
It’s time to work.	Irnaqañ pachaw purini.
No one really knew what went on inside.	Uka manqhan kunas paskäna uk janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatkänti.
So it took a while.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempow pasäna.
I did not walk today.	Jichhürojj janiw kayuk sarkti.
I think she really loves him.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasi sasaw amuyta.

It could do worse next time.	Jutïr kutin jukʼamp jan walinak luraspa.
You don’t have to, you know.	Jumax janiw uk lurañamäkiti, jumax yatisktawa.

But he knows something.	Ukampis jupax kuns yati.
How do you do that.	Kunjamsa uk lurasma.
I thought he would.	Jupajj ukham lurani sasaw amuyayäta.
I’m a very small person.	Nayax wali jisk’a jaqïtwa.
You don’t want to leave.	Jumax janiw sarxañ munktati.

And one certainly doesn’t want to make a bad decision.	Ukat maynix chiqpachansa janiw jan wali amtar puriñ munkiti.

This may take a little time, but it is well worth it.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa, ukampis ukajj wali askiwa.

But nothing really did.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukham lurkänti.

I always ask questions.	Nayax sapa kutiw jiskt’asta.
But beyond that, it didn't feel like anything else.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw yaqha ukham amuyaskänti.

That means something more.	Ukajj jukʼamp kun sañ muni.

He’s deeply and perversely in love with her.	Jupax juparux wali jach’a ukat jan wali munasiñampiw uñji.

And the day after that, and the day after that.	Ukat uka qhipa uru, ukat uka qhipa uru.

But that really isn't enough.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax janiw askïkiti.
So he decided to do it.	Ukhamaw jupax uk lurañ amtawayi.
He talked about it.	Jupajj uka toqet parläna.
Or after that.	Jan ukajj uka qhepatjja.
I remember that yesterday.	Nayax qharüruw uk amtaskta.
This did not mean that there was nothing here.	Ukajj janiw akham sañ munkänti, janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
There is no one like that.	Janiw khitis ukham utjkiti.
There really wasn't anything important going on.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna wakiskir kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He rarely does that.	Jupajj jukʼakiw ukham luri.
He’s happy now.	Jupax jichhax kusisitaw jikxatasi.

He never knew what would happen next, it had to be done.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janipuniw yatkänti, ukax lurañaw wakisïna.

It’s good for you in that regard.	Uka tuqitxa jumatakix wali askiwa.

You know, it doesn’t really matter.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.
But he was shaken up.	Ukampis jupajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He says it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Jupax janiw kunäkisa, janiw kunäkisa sasaw saraki.
A learning day.	Mä yatiqañ uru.

He shouldn't be doing that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañapäkiti.

It took about an hour.	Niya mä horaw pasäna.
At this point, that’s really good.	Aka pachanx, ukax chiqpachans wali askiwa.
That night he did it.	Uka arumaw ukham luräna.

It’s going to be a great day.	Ukax mä jach’a uruw jikxatasi.
He didn't say that.	Jupajj janiw ukham arskänti.
He understood one thing.	Jupajj mä toqetwa sum amuyäna.
I decided to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw lurañ amtawayta.
But that is what he decided to do.	Ukampis ukhamwa jupajj amtäna.
For a long time no one could speak.	Walja tiempojj janiw khitis parlañ puedkänti.
But it’s not all that.	Ukampis janiw taqpach ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to give himself a voice.	Jupajj jupa pachpaw mä aru churañ munäna.
It takes some energy to do this, a tremendous amount of energy.	Uk lurañatakix mä juk’a ch’amaw munasispa, mä jach’a ch’amaw wakisi.
He is the real problem.	Jupaw chiqpach jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.

It was an isolated incident.	Ukajj mä sapakiw pasäna.
But not all of this was understood.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kunas amuyaskänti.
Strange, but delicious.	Muspharkañawa, ukampis wali sumawa.

He goes silent again.	Jupax wasitat amukiw sarxi.
Or everything else.	Jan ukajj taqe kunas ukhamawa.

In fact, many times it doesn’t exist.	Chiqansa, walja kutiw jan ukax utjkiti.

And it’s very cold.	Ukat wali thaya.

But he obviously wasn’t, not yet.	Ukampis qhanaw jupax janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkänti.
In fact, it once was.	Chiqansa, mä kutix ukhamänwa.
You mean nothing to me.	Jumax nayatakix janiw kunäkisa.
No one knows who that is.	Ukajj khitïnsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.

Something happens every week.	Sapa semanaw kunas pasaspa.

I’d like to see some action.	Nayax mä juk’a lurañ uñjañ munta.
Of course, there was no problem.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I didn't really want to do that, it sort of happened.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukham lurañ munkayätti, mä jukʼa pasäna.
He wants both.	Jupax pä tuqitsa munaraki.
I’m sure you know exactly what to do.	Nayax yatxatwa, jumax kuns lurañama uk sum yatta.

He’s the one who did things.	Jupaw kuns luräna.
But that’s what I like.	Ukampis ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It wasn’t the money.	Janiw uka qullqix utjkänti.
Of course it is impossible.	Chiqansa janiw lurañjamäkiti.

It’s very, very important.	Ukax wali, wali wakiskiriwa.
He’s a bad guy.	Jupax mä jan wali jaqiwa.

That’s a real challenge for me.	Ukax nayatakix chiqpach ch’amawa.

But he did so much better than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
There is something about it that I like.	Ukanjja, mä kunaw utji, ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
And nothing works.	Ukat janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
For one thing, it’s obvious.	Mä tuqitxa, ukax qhanawa.

He doesn’t like the city.	Jupax janiw markarux munaskiti.

Something strange happened.	Mä muspharkañ kunaw pasäna.

A little over three weeks.	Mä jukʼa kimsa semanaw pasäna.
No one does that today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
He did something new.	Jupaw machaq lurañanak luräna.
I have been through it several times.	Nayajj walja kutiw uka toqet sarawayta.
Don’t stop coming.	Janiw jutañ jaytañamäkiti.
He decided to stay there, too.	Jupax ukan qhiparañ amtäna, ukhamaraki.
In fact, there is no additional cost.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna yaqha qullqis utjkiti.
The real world again.	Chiqpach pachax wasitatwa.

And no one understood it better than he did.	Ukat janiw khitis jupat sipansa jukʼamp sum amuykänti.
He doesn't do it anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp lurkiti.
Something close hit once, twice.	Kunas jak’an mä kuti, pä kuti ch’allt’äna.
But there is a bright future ahead.	Ukampis jutïrin wali sumaw jutïrin utjani.
This lasted three years or more.	Ukajj kimsa mara jan ukajj jukʼamp maranakaw utjäna.
I am always surprised by this.	Uka tuqitxa sapa kutiw muspharta.

But he knew better.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp sumwa yatïna.
I was afraid he couldn't do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkaspänti sasaw ajjsarayäta.
I don’t want to say that, right now.	Janiw nayax ukham sañ munkti, jichhax.
He just has to do it.	Jupax ukhamakiw lurañapa.
You’re amazingly nice to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali muspharkañ suma jaqïtawa.

Because he really is.	Kunatix jupax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
A little party.	Mä jisk’a fiesta.
No one else is.	Janiw khitis jan ukasti.
I think it was the same night.	Uka pachpa arumaw sasaw amuyta.
I’m still a bit not on one side.	Nayax wali mä juk’a jan mä tuqitxa.
He had never said that to her before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj uka arunak jupar siskänti.
He lived a very cautious life.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jakasïna.
I never saw him properly.	Nayajj janipuniw jupar sum uñjkti.
But let’s see again.	Ukampis wasitat uñjañäni.
I don’t plan on talking about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit parlañ amtkti.
That’s what happens over there.	Ukhamaw uka chiqanx luraski.
Now, of course.	Jichhax, chiqpachansa.
The most important of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
He says he didn’t do it.	Jupax janiw uk lurkti sasaw saraki.
I know how he is.	Nayax kunjamsa jupax uk yatta.
These last few days have been particularly bad.	Aka qhipa urunakanx juk’amp jan waliw utjawayi.

But he didn't know.	Ukampis jupajj janiw yatkänti.

He didn't want to talk to her.	Janiw jupamp parlañ munkänti.

You really feel that way, of course.	Chiqpachansa ukham jikxatastaxa, chiqpachansa.
This time it’s an adult.	Jichha kutix mä jilïr jaqiwa.
But she looked anything but happy.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kunäkisa, jan ukasti kusisitaw uñnaqäna.

Just like I did.	Kunjamtï nayajj lurkäna ukhama.
I saw him a while ago.	Mä jukʼa tiempo nayraw jupar uñjta.
He hit it hard.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
And later that year, he refused.	Ukat uka mara qhepatjja, janiw munkänti.
It’s a single person.	Ukaxa mä sapa jaqiwa.
Of course he did it.	Chiqansa jupaw ukham luräna.
There’s something about that place.	Uka chiqanx kunas utji.

But I don't see what I'm doing wrong here.	Ukampis nayajj janiw kuntï akan jan wal lurkta uk uñjkti.

You are also .	Jumax ukhamarakiw .
It didn’t mean that.	Janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
He was very reluctant.	Jupajj walpun jan munkänti.
Because this man knows something.	Kunatix aka jaqix kuns yati.
Such a move is impossible now.	Ukham sarañajj janiw jichhajj utjkaspati.
He is fine and doing everything.	Jupajj walikïskiwa ukat taqe kunsa luraski.
There are no adults.	Janiw jilïr jaqinakax utjkiti.

You know he wouldn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkaspänti uk yatisktawa.
Everything he could do.	Taqe kunatï jupajj lurañapäkäna.

He told me he was sorry.	Jupax llakistwa sasaw sitäna.

But it can happen very quickly.	Ukampis wali jankʼakiw pasaspa.

There’s one thing he can’t do.	Mä kunaw utji, jupax janiw lurañjamäkiti.

And that feels good.	Ukat ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi.

But, in the end, there was no other option.	Ukampis, qhepatjja, janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
She is an older woman.	Jupax mä jilïr warmiwa.
He was the first to do it.	Jupaw nayrïr kutin luratayna.

He doesn’t want to tell.	Jupax janiw yatiyañ munkiti.

Then he ordered one for a big party.	Ukat mä jachʼa fiesta lurañatakiw mä mayïna.
I’m not sure what that means in the long run.	Nayax janiw yatkti kunas ukax jaya pachanx sañ muni.
It takes half an hour.	Ukax chika horaw sarañapa.
I didn't understand what was going on.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
The answer is as follows.	Ukajj akham siwa.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk sum yatiyäta.
And, he loved it.	Ukat, jupax walpun munasïna.
I have done this before.	Nayajj nayraw uk lurayäta.
Let’s see when and how.	Kunapachas ukat kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
I let the guy do it.	Nayax uka waynaruw uk lurañapatak jaytawayta.
That is not the case for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He is the most important person.	Jupajj jukʼamp wakiskir jaqewa.
In fact, I still love him.	Chiqansa, juparux wali munasiñampiw uñjta.
I have a place in the city.	Nayax markanx mä chiqaw utjitu.
There is nothing wrong with him.	Jupan kunas janiw walïkiti.
This is the guy.	Akax uka waynawa.
He did as he was told.	Jupajj kunjamtï siskäna ukhamwa luräna.
Is it necessary to do so.	Ukham lurañajj wakisispati.
I probably would have done that.	Nayajj inas ukham lurayäta.
He decided to go to school for another year.	Jupajj yaqha maraw escuelar sarañ amtäna.
He just took it out.	Jupajj ukhamakiw apsüna.
It wasn't like that before.	Janiw ukham nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
But now something needed to be done.	Ukampis jichhajj kuna lurañas wakisïna.
Not really sure of anything else.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa chiqpachapunix chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
They don’t know that.	Jupanakax janiw uk yatipkiti.
I can’t remember when the last time was.	Qhipa kutix kuna pachas utjäna uk janiw amtaskti.
Where did it come from.	Kawkitsa jutäna.
But he understood how he asked it, and why.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jisktʼäna, ukat kunatsa ukham jisktʼäna uk sum amuyäna.
I didn’t want to go see things.	Janiw yänak uñjir sarañ munkayätti.
He was sure that no one was inside.	Jupajj janiw khitis manqhan utjkänti sasaw sum yatïna.
I’ve definitely felt it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham jikxatasiyäta.
But she’s a woman.	Ukampis jupax warmiwa.
This wasn’t him.	Akax janiw jupax ukhamäkänti.
I don’t, I can’t do that.	Nayax janiw, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I’m sorry, but often.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis walja kutiw.
So you have to do it yourself.	Ukhamajj juma pachpaw lurañama.
I’m a real person.	Nayax chiqpach jaqïtwa.
I know, I know what will happen.	Nayajj yattwa, kunas pasani uk yattwa.
I think this is what’s going on.	Nayax amuyta akax kunas utji.
Things too much or something.	Kunanakas sinti jan ukax kunas.
That’s what needs to be done.	Ukax kuna lurañas wakisi.
He didn't know when that would happen.	Kunapachas ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
It’s just as good.	Ukax ukhamarakiw wali suma.
That’s who he was, what he did.	Ukaw khitïnsa, kunsa luräna.
He didn't say anything to her.	Janiw kuns jupar siskänti.
Both sides of the issue.	Panpachaniw uka tuqitxa.
But do it quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw lurañama.
It’s going to be very slow.	Wali ch’amampiw saraski.
That’s what the guy is.	Ukaw uka waynax utji.
This happened three times.	Ukajj kimsa kutiw pasäna.
I still doubt it.	Nayax wali pächastwa.
He knew this for many years.	Walja maranakaw uk yatïna.
If you really don’t want to.	Chiqpachansa jan munkta ukhaxa.
I said it doesn’t matter.	Nayax janiw ukax wakiskiti sasaw sista.
He certainly won’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkaniti.
I’ve been thinking about doing this for some time.	Nayax mä qawqha pachaw uk lurañ amtawayta.
There are these.	Ukanakaw utji.
He is going with you.	Jupajj jumamp chikaw saraski.
That’s how it came about.	Ukhamaw jutäna.
I have seen them many times.	Nayajj walja kutiw jupanakar uñjta.
It’s worth it and it’s worth it.	Ukax wali askiwa ukat wali askiwa.
He came through very clearly.	Jupax wali qhanaw uka tuqit jutäna.
Very slow but smooth.	Wali llamp’u ukampis suma.
Three times I refused him.	Kimsa kutiw jupar jan munkti.
It doesn’t really matter what you do next.	Janiw chiqpachapunix kuns jutïrin lurañax wakiskiti.
He had just discovered something.	Jupajj jichhakiw kuns jikjjatasïna.
I want you to give me space.	Nayax jumanakan nayar mä chiqa churañ munta.
I asked him why that was.	Ukajj kunatsa uk jisktʼta.
After that, I went there.	Uka qhepatjja, ukaruw sarawayta.
He’s a pleasure to eat.	Jupax manq’añax wali kusiskañawa.
I thought you might want to do that yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham lurañ munasma sasaw amuyayäta.
But he was good at what he did.	Ukampis kuntï lurkäna uk sum lurañ yatïna.
Which is what he said.	Ukajj kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukawa.
But that was even better.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
It’s so hard these days.	Aka urunakanx wali ch’amawa.
This is not a good thing.	Akax janiw askïkiti.
It’s your responsibility.	Juman lurañamawa.
They are not .	Jupanakajj janiw .
I don’t know much about him.	Janiw jupat wal yatkti.
I look forward to seeing them.	Jupanakar uñjañ wal suyaskta.
I don’t know anyone.	Janiw khitis siskti.
That’s what did it all.	Ukaw taqe ukanak luräna.
But it will arrive tomorrow.	Ukampis qharüruw purini.
It will take time, but it needs to be done.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasini, ukampis lurañaw wakisi.
I don't believe it.	Nayajj janiw creykti.
I plan to do this every other day.	Sapa pä uruw ukham lurañ amtasta.
Who do you think you are.	Khitis jumajj amuyta.
But that's what he wanted.	Ukampis ukajj jupajj munäna.
I played guitar there.	Ukanjja, guitarra tocañ yatta.
All day he knew it.	Taqi uruw jupax uk yatïna.
Something is better than nothing.	Kunas jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
No, not at all.	Janiwa, janiw kunjamatsa.
The school doesn’t want to.	Yatiqañ utax janiw munkiti.
He is the same person.	Jupax pachpa jaqiwa.
Also, it works for me.	Ukhamaraki, nayatakix wali askiwa.
That required something else.	Ukatakejj yaqha lurañaw wakisïna.
And no it isn’t.	Ukat janiw janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want something to happen.	Kunas pasañap munta.
It’s a young man.	Mä waynawa.
There was plenty of time.	Uka tiemponjja, walja tiempow utjäna.
Well, that’s basically it.	Ukhama, ukax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
He could do no worse.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jan walinak lurañ puedkänti.
Why not or not.	Kunatsa jan ukax janicha.
There and then.	Ukan ukat ukat.
What had just happened was obvious.	Kunatï jichhajj paskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He could have, if he wanted to.	Jupajj ukham luraspänwa, munpachäna ukhajja.
It gets to the police.	Ukax policiaruw puri.
On the contrary, he seems stupid to me, alone.	Jan ukasti, jupax nayatakix llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa, sapakiw.
This is absolutely necessary.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wakisi.
I'm going to sleep.	Nayajj ikiñar saraskta.
I know, he thought.	Nayax yattwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
So, you have to do it.	Ukhamajj, jumajj lurañamawa.
He was right about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet parläna.
I know what that means to you.	Nayajj yattwa kunsa ukajj jumatakejj sañ muni.
He knew everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa yatïna.
That will be the future.	Ukaw jutïrin utjani.
She informed him.	Jupajj jupar yatiyäna.
But of course you can.	Ukampis chiqpachansa jumax ukham lurasma.
I think it would be good for you.	Nayax jumatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
So he called her.	Ukatwa jupar jawsäna.
That was a thing of mine.	Ukajj nayan mä kunaw utjäna.
But it took time.	Ukampis ukatakejj tiempow munasïna.
A mild night air.	Mä llamp’u arumax thaya.
In fact, it means what was happening to me.	Chiqansa, kuntï nayar luraskäna uk sañ muni.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Janiw kuna jan wali lurañas utjkänti.
I love this part of the meal.	Nayax aka manq’añ tuqitx walpun munasta.
In fact, this happened many times.	Chiqansa, ukax walja kutiw pasäna.
You know what’s coming.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas jutani.
No one knew better.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp sum yatkänti.
No one really likes what they have to do.	Kun lurañas wakisispa uk janiw khitirus chiqpachapunix gustkiti.
Do what you want to live.	Kun jakañ munkta uk luram.
Now do as you say.	Jichhax kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhamarjam luram.
Well, whatever it is.	Ukhama, kunas ukhama.
I know this is hard.	Nayax yattwa akax ch’amawa.
He wasn't sure where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I can't even imagine doing that.	Ukham lurañsa janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
He’s totally amazing and wonderful.	Jupax taqpach muspharkañ ukat wali suma jaqiwa.
Just a little slower.	Ukhama mä juk’a llamp’u.
He came to this place.	Jupajj aka cheqar jutäna.
Always the same kind.	Sapa kutiw pachpa kasta.
The question was asked.	Uka jisktʼajj akham sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He’s a tough guy.	Jupax mä qhuru jaqiwa.
That’s the first thing he needs to do.	Ukaw nayrïr lurañapa.
It’s a surprise, it’s beautiful.	Ukax mä muspharkañawa, ukax wali sumawa.
I’ve seen it a little bit better.	Nayax mä juk’a sum uñjta.
He did everything wrong.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jan wal luräna.
I told him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar sista.
He didn't even think about doing it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañsa amuykänti.
He obviously wanted to get back in again.	Jupax qhanaw wasitat mantañ munäna.
Not in the way he wanted.	Janiw kunjamtï jupax munkäna ukhama.
I think we will see soon.	Niyaw uñjañäni sasaw amuyta.
I want to get into it.	Nayax ukar mantañ munta.
Don’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak luramti.
So far the results have been pretty good.	Jichhakamax ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
What's the muni.	Kunas muni.
There was really nothing to do.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He made his home in the city.	Jupajj markanwa utap luratayna.
But he knows who he is.	Ukampis khitïnsa uk sum yati.
I just, you know, I guess.	Nayax ukhamakiw, jumax yatisktawa, amuyta.
And the money,.	Ukat uka qullqix,.
I saw what he was doing.	Kuntï jupajj luraskäna uk uñjta.
He wants, you know.	Jupax muni, jumax yatisktawa.
Maybe this morning.	Inas jichha alwax ukhama.
I want to give it to them.	Nayax jupanakar churañ munta.
Let's see where that goes.	Ukajj kawkirus saraski uk uñjañäni.
But then it was good.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wali sumapunïnwa.
He didn't want to go there.	Jupajj janiw uka cheqar sarañ munkänti.
I know why he did it.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk sum yatta.
I almost never drink.	Niya janipuniw umañ yatkti.
I once said yes.	Nayax mä kutix jïsa sasaw sista.
The morning went well, obviously.	Alwajj wali sum sarjjäna, qhanaw amuyasïna.
This seems to happen a lot today.	Ukajj jichhürunakan wal pasaspa ukhamawa.
Instead of doing the work.	Uka lurañ lurañat sipansa.
He hoped to do so soon.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk lurañ suyäna.
I was just as scared.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw ajjsarayäta.
He sees it with concern.	Jupax llakitaw uñji.
Not yet, but soon.	Janiw jichhakamax utjkiti, jan ukasti niyaw.
That’s why he lived.	Ukatwa jupajj jakasïna.
One thing was very clear.	Mä tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
Not so, today.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, jichhürunakanxa.
He says you can only do what you can.	Jupax siwa, kuntix lurañjamäki ukakiw lurasma.
Except they weren’t, of course.	Jan ukasti jupanakax janiw utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
He’s right about that.	Jupax chiqaw uka tuqitxa.
There is real work to be done.	Chiqpach lurañaw utji.
But that time is not right now.	Ukampis uka tiempojj janiw jichhajj walïkiti.
He gave a blank tail.	Mä ch’uqi chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
Tonight is the best.	Jichha arumax wali askiwa.
About that, he says.	Uka tuqitxa, sasaw saraki.
Whatever happened.	Kunas kunas pasäna.
So it just arrived.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw purini.
No one thinks you can do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykiti.
I saw another day.	Nayax yaqha uru uñjta.
Maybe, one day.	Inas, mä urux.
But this is a real chance for you.	Ukampis akax jumatakix chiqpach ch’amawa.
For the first time, he thought so.	Nayrïr kutiw ukham amuyäna.
And he wanted to see her again.	Ukat wasitatwa jupar uñjañ munäna.
It was like that for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj ukhamänwa.
I let him ride it.	Nayax ukaruw kayuk sarañapatak jaytawayta.
And everything else.	Ukat taqi kuna.
You don’t want that to happen.	Janiw ukham lurasiñap munktati.
I know how he feels about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
In fact, it’s really wrong.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa janiw walïkiti.
He threw another force at me.	Jupajj yaqha chʼamampiw nayar jaqontäna.
An amazing time.	Mä muspharkañ tiempo.
Do this every year.	Sapa maraw uk lurañama.
He just did it right away.	Jupax ukhamakiw luratayna.
I want to tell you what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiyañ munta.
I love it because it’s so simple and beautiful.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw kunatix ukax wali ch’amawa ukat wali sumawa.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukham sasaw amuyäna.
But then, of course, he did.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, cheqapuniw jupajj ukham luräna.
But that was something he took seriously.	Ukampis ukajj jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
You don’t have to do it again.	Janiw mayamp lurañax wakiskiti.
I have nothing on him yet.	Nayax janiw kunas juparux jichhakamax utjkituti.
About anything, really.	Kuna tuqitsa, chiqpachansa.
I immediately started it.	Ukat jankʼakiw uk qalltawayta.
Make it the way you want it.	Kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam lurañamawa.
That's not right, that's not right.	Ukajj janiw walïkiti, ukajj janiw walïkiti.
I didn’t see anything.	Janiw kuns uñjkti.
That’s saying something, of course.	Ukax mä kuns sañ muni, chiqpachansa.
But today, there is a constant.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, mä sapa kutiw utji.
Leaving tomorrow is the first day.	Qhipürux nayrïr uruw sarxani.
Well, maybe it’s better than that.	Ukhama, inas ukat sipansa juk’amp askiwa.
Something is really wrong.	Chiqpachansa kunas jan walïki.

He plans to leave soon.	Jupax jank’akiw sarxañ amti.

To be honest, he didn’t quite know.	Chiqpachansa, janiw sum yatkänti.

You know what you know.	Kuntï jumajj yatkta ukajj yatisktawa.
But I can’t believe I’m doing that.	Ukampis janiw uka lurañax iyaw sañjamäkiti.
So you have to work hard.	Ukhamajj wal chʼamachasiñama.
I don't care what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.

I don’t want to see it again.	Janiw mayamp uñjañ munkti.
Not necessary, of course.	Janiw wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
But then he agreed.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, jupajj iyaw sänwa.
He hadn't for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan ukham lurkänti.
He loves you.	Jupajj jumaruw munasi.

He’s doing fine, though.	Jupax wali sum luraski, ukampis.
I really know about that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqit sum yatta.
That’s weird, if you will.	Ukax muspharkañawa, jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
He didn't know who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk janiw yatkänti.
It’s really nice for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali sumawa.
But all of this was not really the case.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
This is it, you think.	Akax ukhamawa, jumax amuyta.
Feel bad about it, but really.	Uka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatasïta, ukampis chiqpachansa.
He came over immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka cheqar jutäna.
Now, tell us about him.	Jichhax, jupat yatiyapxita.
I felt alone and that’s it.	Nayax sapakiw jikxatasiyäta ukat ukham jikxatasiyäta.
It worked itself out.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw irnaqäna.

In fact, it doesn’t really matter.	Chiqansa, janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.

In a way it was.	Mä chiqanx ukhamänwa.
And he doesn’t want to do what you do.	Ukat jupax janiw kuntix jumax lurkta uk lurañ munkiti.
I think that’s what he wants.	Nayax amuyta, ukax kuntix jupax munki ukawa.
And that beer.	Ukat uka cerveza.
And I came with him.	Ukat nayajj jupamp chikaw jutta.

Which is what he did.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukawa.

In this case it wasn’t.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn’t want to say anything.	Jupax janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
In fact, he did it.	Chiqpachansa, jupaw ukham luräna.
They were very important.	Wali wakiskiriwa.
After such a long time.	Ukham jaya tiempo qhepatjja.

He wants to do a lot of things himself.	Jupa pachpaw walja lurañanak lurañ muni.

And, yes, it is.	Ukat, jïsa, ukhamawa.

He practically dropped it.	Jupajj niyaw ukanak jaqontäna.

I hadn’t thought of it in years.	Walja maranakaw jan ukham amuyirïkti.

You might want to see him before you leave.	Inas janïr sarkasajj jupar uñjañ munsta.
That’s pretty cool to me.	Ukax nayatakix wali sumawa.
And he realized what it was.	Ukat kunas uk amuyasïna.

None of that, really.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
He was doing well himself.	Jupa pachpaw wali sum luraskäna.
The drive lasted about two hours and was very pleasant.	Uka autot sarañajj niya pä horaw utjäna ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
Three and three.	Kimsa ukat kimsa.
Let’s see what happens if you don’t.	Jan ukham lurasax kunas pasaspa uk uñjañäni.
I have nothing to do with it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit kuns lurkti.
Do this every time of the day.	Uka urux sapa kutiw ukham lurañama.
I want the police.	Nayax policiaruw munta.
Much bigger than me.	Nayat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
He was looking through it.	Jupajj uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
And really, that’s exactly what happens.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw kunatix luraski.
I’ve done the work.	Nayaw lurañanak lurawayta.
I love this country as much as you do.	Nayax jumar uñtasit aka markarux walpun munasta.
Weird, that’s weird, unsurprising.	Muspharkañawa, ukax muspharkañawa, jan muspharkañawa.
He had done something wrong .	Jupajj jan walinak luratayna .
That goes really fast.	Ukax chiqpachansa jank’akiw saraski.
He’s got to do it.	Jupax uk lurañapawa.
Beautiful and amazing.	Suma ukat muspharkañ.
I didn't think so a while ago.	Mä jukʼa tiempo nayrajj janiw ukham amuykayätti.
She wants a man.	Jupax mä chacharuw muni.
I don’t go anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha cheqar sarkti.
Wherever that might be.	Kawkhantï ukajj utjaspa.
Anything could do with energy.	Kunas ch’amampiw luraspäna.
But not this time around.	Ukampis janiw jichha kutin ukhamäkiti.
I told him that was fine with me.	Ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa sasaw sista.
I’m a little worried about it.	Nayax mä juk’a llakistwa uka tuqitxa.
They are not necessary at all.	Jupanakax janiw kunjamatsa wakiskiti.
I don’t know anything about him.	Janiw nayax jupat kuns yatkti.
If what happened happens.	Kunatï paskäna ukajj pasaspa ukhajja.
They don’t exist.	Jupanakax janiw utjkiti.
He knew how to handle it.	Jupajj kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatïna.
That’s not what it’s about right now.	Ukax janiw jichhax uka tuqitxa.
All of these are available today.	Taqe ukanakaw jichhürunakan utji.
It doesn’t mean it’s more important.	Janiw juk’amp wakiskir sañ munkiti.
She went home with him.	Jupampiw utar sarjjäna.
Not that good, but better than nothing.	Janiw ukham askïkiti, jan ukasti jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
He threw one at the boy.	Jupajj uka waynaruw mä jaqontäna.
He knew what he meant.	Jupajj kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
Don’t miss a thing!.	¡Janiw mä kuns jaytañamäkiti!.
And there really is nothing to do.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
I don’t think there’s anything you can do.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
No, it doesn't exist.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj utjkiti.
It’s been going on for a long time.	Walja pachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
This was not the way it was supposed to work.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhamäkänti.
He is considered a very dangerous person.	Jupajj wali jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa uñjasi.
Wonderful film all around.	Muspharkañ película taqi chiqan.
This is the case here.	Akax akanx ukhamawa.
For how long I didn’t know.	Qhawqha tiempos uk janiw yatkayätti.
That’s what happened recently.	Ukaw jichhak pasäna.
I asked to go with him.	Nayajj jupamp sarañatakiw mayïna.
I know you’ve got him already.	Nayax yattwa jumax juparux niyaw jikxatastaxa.
And you have to do something.	Ukat kuns lurañamawa.
Not mine really though.	Janiw nayan chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
I did it three times last week.	Nayax kimsa kutiw pasïr semanan lurawayta.
He said he didn’t want to get involved.	Jupax janiw ukar mantañ munkti sasaw säna.
I'm going to go there.	Nayajj ukaruw saraskta.
I started here.	Nayax akham qalltawayta.
Maybe a movie, or something.	Inas mä película, jan ukax yaqha ukhama.
So maybe he should.	Ukhamajj inas jupajj wakischispa.
He doesn't know how to do it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa ukanak lurañ yatkiti.
And that’s what he did here.	Ukat ukax jupaw akan luratayna.
He mentioned it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uka toqet parläna.
I want to get him out of here.	Nayax juparux aka chiqat apsuñ munta.
Now there was no one, nothing.	Jichhajj janiw khitis utjkänti, janiw kunas utjkänti.
That's three days later.	Ukajj kimsa urunak qhepatjja.
Something is very wrong.	Kunas wali jan waliw utji.
There’s something wrong with the place.	Uka chiqanx kunas jan waliw utji.
He slammed the door harder.	Jupax punku juk’amp ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
I don't know who that is.	Ukajj khitis uk janiw yatkti.
He came to me.	Jupajj nayaruw purinïna.
And three of them.	Ukat kimsa.
I don't remember the name.	Janiw uka sutip amtaskti.
It takes more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munasi.
I’m coming from him.	Nayax jupat jutta.
I feel the same way you do.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jumajj ukham jikjjatasta.
He wanted one.	Jupajj mä munäna.
Kind of cool, though.	Mä juk’a thaya, ukampis.
It seems to be very old.	Wali chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
You have to do the right thing about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa lurañama.
He gives me strength.	Jupaw chʼam churitu.
I don’t remember anyone.	Janiw khitimpis amtaskti.
He didn't utter words as he did so.	Ukham lurasajj janiw arunak arskänti.
He was much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
It can never be done properly.	Janipuniw sum lurañjamäkiti.
He saw what needed to be done and he did it.	Jupax kuntix lurañax wakiski uk uñjäna ukat jupaw uk luräna.
I just can't stand it anymore.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp aguantañjamäkiti.
But that is definitely the downside.	Ukampis ukajj cheqapuniw jan walin uñjasi.
He had a good time here.	Jupajj wali sumwa akan jakasïna.
Very, very important.	Wali, wali wakiskiriwa.
There is no need to go.	Janiwa sarañajj wakiskiti.
Why doesn't that exist.	Kunatsa ukax janiw utjkiti.
After all, she decided that it would be better not to.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jan ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askïspa sasaw jupax amtäna.
I understood it perfectly.	Nayajj sum amuyayäta.
I have never been there.	Janipuniw uka cheqar sarkti.
Not all the time, of course.	Janiw taqpach tiempox ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
I think it would be interesting.	Nayax wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
Maybe I knew how to do something.	Inas kunjamsa kun lurañsa yatkayäta.
He was the best of everything.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa wali suma jaqënwa.
I’m not going home.	Janiw utar sarkäti.
Surprisingly, he was sleeping soundly.	Muspharkañawa, jupax wali sum ikiskäna.
Great, thank you very much.	Jach’a, walpun yuspärta.
I refuse to give it to him.	Nayajj janiw jupar uk churañ munkti.
You’re going right.	Jumax chiqaw saraskta.
And what after that.	Ukat kunas uka qhepatjja.
They have nowhere else to go.	Jupanakax janiw yaqha chiqar sarañatakix utjkiti.
I think you should do a good one.	Nayax amuyta jumax mä suma lurañamawa.
But he wasn't there.	Ukampis janiw jupajj utjkänti.
I’m weird and weird.	Nayax muspharkañ ukat jan uñt’at jaqïtwa.
There he did it again.	Ukanjja, wasitatwa uk luräna.
Strange, he thought.	Muspharkañawa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
That wasn’t exactly the case.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkänti.
and.	ukat.
Of course, that didn't mean much.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw sinti sañ munkänti.
He declined to say why he made the decision.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa ukham amtkäna uk arskänti.
No way, she told him.	Janiw kunjamatsa, sasaw jupar säna.
There’s a lightness there.	Ukanx mä llamp’u chuymaw utji.
Short and long would be better.	Jiskʼa ukat jaya tiempojj jukʼamp askïspawa.
In fact, he did nothing like that.	Chiqansa, janiw kuns ukham lurkänti.
The ten hour drive took three days.	Tunka horanak autot sarañajj kimsa uruw munasïna.
He was afraid to do so.	Jupajj ukham lurañ ajjsaräna.
It happened really fast.	Chiqpachansa jankʼakiw pasäna.
You know and I know.	Jumax yatisktawa ukat nayax yattwa.
We will do this for many years to come.	Walja maranakaw ukham lurañäni.
But he wanted to do it again immediately.	Ukampis jankʼakiw wasitat lurañ munäna.
I thought there was only one.	Mä sapakiw utji sasaw amuyayäta.
I want to do everything right.	Nayax taqi kuns sum lurañ munta.
It wasn’t the way we did it.	Janiw kunjamtï lurapkta ukhamäkänti.
And you came with me.	Ukat jumax nayamp chikaw jutta.
It is an amazing time.	Uka tiempojj wali muspharkañawa.
That looks bad.	Ukajj jan wali uñnaqaniwa.
That's what you know.	Ukhamwa uk jumajj yatisktawa.
There’s nothing to do here.	Janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
But stupid in his case.	Ukampis jupan tuqitxa loqhe.
And it’s so great.	Ukat ukhama jach’a.
He didn't need that right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukajj wakiskänti.
Nothing was like that here.	Janiw kunas akan ukhamäkänti.
I think he was very happy when he got home.	Utar purisajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna sasaw amuyta.
So this is what he thought.	Ukhamajj akham sasaw amuyäna.
Above all else.	Niya taqe kunat sipansa.
He didn't want to give up anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns jaytañ munkänti.
I know that very well.	Nayajj uka toqet wali sum yatta.
The real world doesn’t work like that.	Chiqpach pachax janiw ukham irnaqkiti.

But last night.	Ukampis qharüru arumax.
Large piece of meat.	Jach’a aycha ch’uqi.
I appreciate that.	Nayax ukaruw wali askit uñjta.
I rarely do it myself.	Naya pachpaw jukʼakiw uk luraskta.
It’s easy to do the work.	Irnaqañ lurañax wali ch’amawa.
Fortunately, it didn’t matter.	Wali askiwa, janiw ukax wakiskänti.
I’ve been on this for a very long time.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw aka tuqitx jikxatasiyäta.
Let’s do the best we can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk sum lurañäni.
We can’t stay here long.	Jiwasax janiw akan jaya pachax utjkaspati.
It can't be long after that.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.
He’s the one who has me.	Jupaw nayar utjitu.
Let him do what he wants.	Kuntï munki uk lurañapawa.
Overall a great guy.	Taqi kunat sipansa mä jach’a jaqiwa.

I have heard good things about you.	Nayajj jumanakat mä suma arunak istʼta.
But tell me something first.	Ukampis nayraqat mä kuns yatiyapxita.
But when you get there.	Ukampis uka cheqar purisajj.
He walked on his own.	Jupa pachpaw sarnaqäna.
I can't think fast enough.	Janiw jankʼak amuytʼirjamäkti.
Eventually he turned to me.	Qhepatjja, nayaruw kuttʼjjäna.
They don’t have anything.	Jupanakax janiw kunas utjkiti.
And that's it.	Ukat uka.
If you want to know more, let me know.	Jumatix juk’amp yatxatañ munsta ukhax yatiyapxita.
I went with him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupamp chik sarawayta.
Or maybe every day.	Jan ukajj inas sapa uru.
It can happen both ways.	Ukajj panpachaniw pasaspa.
He never had a chance to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
I can't quite figure out why he would want to see it.	Kunatsa uñjañ munpachäna uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
He wanted it to happen for hours.	Walja horanakaw ukham lurasiñap munäna.
I made them up.	Nayaw jupanakar lurawayta.
I wasn't sure how long.	Qhawqha tiempos uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
It needs to be something you want to do.	Ukajj kuntï lurañ munkta uk lurañaw wakisi.
You need to do these things.	Uka jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
We’ll do that soon.	Jiwasax jank’akiw ukham lurañäni.
Both are necessary.	Panpachaniw ukax wakisi.
And that’s why you need to be up front.	Ukat ukatwa nayraqat yatiyañama.
Instead, it doesn’t.	Jan ukasti, janiw ukanak lurkiti.
But then he refused.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw munkänti.
I want to go have a drink.	Nayax mä umañar sarañ munta.
He didn't know how to react.	Jupajj kunjamsa kuns lurani uk janiw yatkänti.
But it wasn’t his.	Ukampis janiw jupan ukhamäkänti.
I do, obviously.	Nayax ukham luraskta, qhanawa.
He would do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luraspäna.
There are many hours.	Walja horanakaw utji.
I worry about what will happen.	Kunas pasani sasaw llakista.
He died a few hours later.	Jupajj mä qhawqha horanak qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
Housing is not currently available.	Uta lurañax jichhax janiw utjkiti.
Ten more days.	Tunka urunak juk’ampi.
Let’s see how things turned out.	Kunjamsa kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
I don't think that's the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
There really was no money.	Chiqpachansa janiw qullqix utjkänti.
That’s what we need to do, he says, in this case.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi, sasaw saraki, aka tuqitxa.
I don’t understand it yet.	Janiw jichhakamax amuykti.
So it never occurred to me.	Ukhamajj janipuniw nayarojj amuyaskänti.
They know exactly what is about to happen.	Kunas niyaw pasani uk sum yatipxi.
He could do it, he knew how.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, kunjamsa uk sum yatïna.
I really loved the first year.	Chiqpachansa nayrïr marax walpun munasta.
I told him yes.	Nayax juparux jïsa sasaw sista.
So once again.	Ukhama mä kuti.
That’s how good he is that day.	Ukhamaw jupax uka urux wali suma.

He was a very successful man.	Jupajj wali sumwa sarnaqäna.

That’s better than me.	Ukax nayat sipan juk’amp askiwa.
Anyway, he knows.	Kawkhansa, jupax yati.
You know how.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjamsa.
But why should he do that.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham lurañapa.
There are two separate ones.	Ukanakajj pä sapa mayniw utji.
But it doesn't work as well as it should.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï lurañapäki ukham sum irnaqkiti.
At this point he doesn’t have to do anything.	Aka pachanx jupax janiw kuns lurañapäkiti.
No, he decided.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
He can’t be there.	Jupax janiw utjkaspati.
After all, that’s what it’s all about.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukatakix ukax wali askiwa.
And that’s what happened.	Ukat ukax ukhamarakiw pasäna.
You may need to do this several times.	Inas walja kuti ukham lurañax wakischispa.

Now, when will it come again?.	Jichhax, ¿kuna pachas wasitat purini?.
That's because.	Ukax kunatix...
He said there was no time.	Jupax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti sasaw säna.
I didn't know that at the time.	Uka tiemponjja janiw uk yatkayätti.
That’s how it always went.	Ukax kunjams sapa kutix saräna.
I love him so much.	Juparux walpun munasta.
But there is no need to go into that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj uka toqet sarañajj wakiskiti.
I wanted this for a while last year.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw pasïr marax uk munta.
So three of them.	Ukhama kimsa.
What should he do?.	¿Kunsa jupajj lurañapa?.
I never said no.	Janipuniw janiw siskti.
I think it’s about time.	Nayax amuyta, niyaw pachax purini.
I don’t want that to happen here.	Janiw nayax aka chiqan ukham lurasiñap munkti.
After that, he saw her more and more.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼamp jukʼampiw jupar uñjäna.
But the young man did not understand.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw amuyaskänti.
I decided to do something about it.	Uka toqet kun lurañwa amtawayta.
He was watching her intently.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Ukjja janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
Not to anyone.	Janiw khitirus.

You’ve been there for a while.	Jumax mä juk’a pachaw ukan jikxatasiyäta.

And I didn’t want to see what would happen.	Ukat kunas pasani uk janiw uñjañ munkayätti.
It’s not like anything else.	Janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
They are not like that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

There’s obviously something going on.	Ukax qhanaw kunas utji.

This is especially noticeable.	Ukajj jukʼampiw amuyasi.
He worked on everyone, big and small.	Jupax taqiniruw jach’a jach’a jisk’a irnaqäna.
Someone else is doing better.	Mayniw jukʼamp sum luraski.
He did the best for us.	Jupaw jiwasatak wali sum luräna.

He could do time.	Jupajj tiempo luraspänwa.
He loved her so much.	Jupajj walpun jupar munasïna.
That or for that matter.	Uka jan ukax ukatakix.
But he didn't want to talk.	Ukampis janiw parlañ munkänti.
He saw it.	Uk uñjäna.

He is a creative man.	Jupajj lurir jaqewa.
Now he really wants one.	Jichhax chiqpachapuniw mä munäna.

Everyone knows how to do it.	Taqinipuniw lurañ yatipxi.

That's wrong, but it's not a new problem.	Ukajj janiw walïkiti, ukampis janiw machaq jan walïkiti.
They don’t know how to walk.	Jupanakax janiw sarnaqañ yatipkiti.
He really, really was.	Jupax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
He would never do that, it was obvious.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

But a future husband is not enough.	Ukampis mä jutïr chachax janiw wakiskiti.
That’s what this guy was.	Ukaw aka waynax utjäna.
Someone needs to do that.	Maynix ukham lurañapawa.
It went from the way he talked.	Kunjamsa jupajj parläna uka toqet sarjjäna.
A great time was had by all.	Mä jach’a pachax taqiniw utjawayi.
But it doesn't matter now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj kunäkisa.
And the man began to walk.	Ukat uka jaqix sarnaqañ qalltäna.
Which, it turns out, makes sense.	Ukax, ukhamaw jikxatasi, ukax wali askiwa.
It’s what he wants.	Ukax kuntix jupax munki ukawa.
I love these things.	Ukanak walpun munta.
Of course he will.	Chiqansa jupax ukham lurani.
A beautiful, brilliant film.	Mä suma, wali suma película.
It has done well so far.	Jichhakamajj wali sumwa lurawayi.
I said of course.	Nayax chiqpachansa sasaw sista.
Nothing was out of place.	Janiw kunas jan cheqan utjkänti.
People are fine, don’t forget that.	Jaqinakax walikïskiwa, janit uk armasimti.
It stuck with me for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj ukajj nayamp chikaw utjäna.
Now he’s one, somehow.	Jichhax jupax mä, kunjamatsa.
Now he’s in great shape.	Jichhax jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
You are an important person.	Jumax wali wakiskir jaqïtawa.
I’ve never been to one.	Janipuniw mä ukar sarkti.
He thought that was important to me.	Nayatakejj ukajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyäna.
He was not what I expected.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï suykayäta ukhamäkänti.
But then so did he.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw jupajj luräna.
That could be him.	Ukajj jupaw utjaspa.
Now on to the next one.	Jichhax jutïr tuqitxa.
Nobody wanted them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.
They don’t know what’s really going on.	Kunas cheqpachapun pasaski uk janiw yatipkiti.
But no one knew much about him.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupat wal sum yatkänti.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw lurawayta.
I'm not the one.	Nayajj jan ukajj naya.
People like him .	Jupar uñtasit jaqenakajj .
A little too short.	Mä juk’a sinti jisk’a.
I’m asking why.	Nayax kunatsa uk jiskt’asta.
He is passing behind me.	Jupajj nayat qhepatwa pasaski.
It’s not this world.	Janiw aka pachax utjkiti.
Rather, he felt that these things were not necessary.	Jan ukasti, janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti sasaw amuyäna.
He was the reason one lived.	Jupaw kunatsa maynix jakasïna.
I saw him last week.	Nayax juparux pasïr semanaw uñjta.
So he gave me a year.	Ukatwa mä mara churitu.
I want to get out of here as soon as possible.	Nayax jank’akiw aka chiqat mistuñ munta.
And there’s nothing wrong with that.	Ukat janiw kunas jan walïkiti.
Never do it in the first place.	Janipuniw nayrïr kutin ukham lurañamäkiti.
You know how he does it.	Kunjamsa uk luri uk jumajj yatisktawa.
He didn't want to move.	Jupajj janiw sarnaqañ munkänti.
I like the food I eat.	Nayax manq’añax wali askiwa.
Instead, he did it.	Jan ukasti, jupax ukham luratayna.
And, beyond that.	Ukat, ukat juk’ampi.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Ukat janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañjamäkiti.
I did it, just recently.	Nayax uk lurawayta, jichhakiw ukham lurawayta.
It happened three years ago.	Kimsa mara nayraw pasäna.
It doesn’t matter if you want something or not.	Janiw kunas munaskiti janicha ukax wakiskiti.
It was cool and quiet.	Ukajj wali thaya ukat amukiw jikjjatasïna.
There would never be a problem.	Janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
Like he didn’t do anything.	Kunjamtï jan kuns lurkäna ukhama.
This is what he’s best known for.	Akax jupax wali uñt’atawa.
He tried to do it again.	Jupajj wasitat lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
He did this for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham luräna.
In fact, he feels good about himself.	Chiqansa, jupa pachpaw wali sum jikxatasi.
Want to learn a bit more?.	¿Mä juk’amp yatxatañ munasmati?.
I really didn’t want to know about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax uka tuqit yatxatañ munkayätti.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa lurañjamäkiti.
I, yes, am.	Nayax, jïsa.
I want to get home.	Utar puriñ munta.
It won’t last long.	Janiw jaya tiempox utjkaniti.
He gave her the options.	Jupaw kunanaktï lurañ amtkäna ukanak jupar churäna.
Which, of course, he is.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamawa.
I don’t want money.	Nayax janiw qullqi munkti.
He sat there for two hours.	Jupajj pä horaw ukan qontʼasïna.
Except this one is beautiful.	Jan ukasti akax wali sumawa.
I want to drink too much.	Nayax sinti umañ munta.
He almost refused.	Jupajj niyaw jan munkänti.
We are not the same.	Jiwasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was this strange night.	Ukanjja aka muspharkañ arumaw utjäna.
Rain, rain, rain every day.	Sapa uruw jallu, jallu, jallu.
I never had a chance.	Janipuniw mä oportunidad utjkitänti.
I’m the one who started it.	Nayaw uka qalltawayta.
You really can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It was something he had to do.	Ukajj kunatï lurañapäkäna ukhamänwa.
But what if it happens.	Ukampis ¿kunas pasaspa.
This required a few steps.	Ukatakejj mä qhawqha lurañanak lurañaw wakisïna.
He wanted a life with her.	Jupampiw mä jakañ munäna.
The snow, the snow.	Uka ch’uqi, uka ch’uqi.
Absolutely yes, he says.	Chiqpachansa jïsa, sasaw saraki.
I feel that this is true.	Ukajj cheqapuniw sasaw amuyasta.
He was very happy now.	Jupajj jichhajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I think it’s both.	Nayax panpachaniw sasaw amuyta.
He knew things that no one else could.	Jupajj kunanaktï jan khitis yatkaspa uk sum yatïna.
Two years later, he returned home.	Pä mara qhepatjja, utaparuw kuttʼjjäna.
Everything is anything.	Taqi kunas kunas.
Clearly he didn’t know the first thing about it.	Qhanaw jupax janiw uka tuqit nayrïr kun yatkänti.
He did that for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow ukham luräna.
I don’t mean you, of course.	Janiw nayax jumat sañ munkti, chiqpachansa.
It seemed he didn't want to say his name.	Janiw sutip arsuñ munkänti sasaw amuyasïna.
It was actually better than I expected.	Chiqansa, kuntï suykayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
He was still not eating.	Jupajj wali jan manqʼat jikjjatasïna.
They were, they were beautiful.	Wali, wali sumawa.
It never happened.	Janipuniw ukajj utjkänti.
I didn’t want to leave him alone.	Janiw jupa sapak jaytañ munkayätti.
And it actually happened, once.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamarakiw pasäna, mä kutix.
It’s weird, but it’s worth it.	Muspharkañawa, ukampis ukax wali askiwa.
This is not something you can do from a distance.	Ukax janiw mä jaya chiqat lurañjamäkiti.
But no one really knows for sure.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpachapuni sum yatkiti.
I’ve never seen anyone like that.	Janipuniw khitirus ukham uñjkti.
What he wants is obvious, what you want is less.	Kuntix jupax munki ukax qhanawa, kuntix jumax munkta ukax juk’akiw.
What it is doesn't matter.	Kunas ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
And what’s inside? 	Ukat ¿kunas manqhan utji?
I decided I had to do something.	Nayax kuns lurañaw wakisi sasaw amtawayta.
He stole the car.	Jupajj uka auto lunthatasïna.
Then he started taking more.	Ukat jukʼamp apsuñ qalltäna.
I don't remember anyone.	Janiw khitis uk amtaskti.
It’s a huge challenge for me.	Nayatakix wali jach’a ch’amawa.
I went to bed very happy.	Nayax wali kusisitaw ikiñar sarawayta.
That is what he did for me.	Ukaw jupajj nayatak luräna.
He's a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumawa.
I’m looking forward to that day.	Nayax uka urux wali suyt’askta.
He’s not good enough for you.	Jupax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
But he wants to say the same thing.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw sañ munaraki.
The results are remarkable.	Ukham lurasajj wali muspharkañawa.
But he spoke without sincerity.	Ukampis jan taqe chuymaw parläna.
I wonder how many times he does that.	Qhawqha kutis ukham luri sasaw jisktʼasta.
No one understood what he had just said.	Kuntï jichhak siskäna uk janiw khitis amuykänti.
He is who he says he is.	Jupax khititix jupax siski ukawa.
He knew it well enough.	Jupajj sum yatïna.
There is everything there.	Ukanjja taqe kunaw utji.
Make it the way you want it.	Kunjamtï jumajj munkta ukham luram.
You only need to do this once.	Mä kutikiw uka lurañax wakisi.
But it’s just that for now.	Ukampis jichhax ukhamakiw.
But not everyone knows that.	Ukampis janiw taqenis ukham yatipkiti.
The day went well.	Uka urux wali sum sarxäna.
That’s how it’s arrived.	Ukhamaw purini.
He was morning man.	Jupajj alwajj jaqënwa.
She said that was wonderful.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa sasaw jupajj säna.
This is more likely to happen.	Ukajj jukʼampiw pasaspa.
That was the last time he did that.	Ukajj qhep qhepa kutiw ukham luräna.
So that's one of them.	Ukhamajj ukajj maynïriwa.
What happens after him.	Kunas jupat qhepat pasani.
We’ll do this both ways.	Ukax panpachaniw lurañäni.
There, it’s a great night.	Ukanx, mä jach’a arumaw utji.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunäkisa.
That’s what this is all about.	Ukaw akax utji.
Tomorrow would be better.	Qhipürux jukʼamp askïspawa.
But, except, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, jan ukasti, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Now I can't stand it anymore.	Jichhajj janiw jukʼamp aguantañjamäkiti.
But he didn't understand.	Ukampis janiw amuykänti.
He didn't like it at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw jupar gustkänti.
I want everything.	Nayax taqi kuns munta.
I have always been very aware of this.	Uka tuqitxa nayratpachaw wal amuyasta.
He told me how much he loved her.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupar munasta uk yatiyäna.
The last word.	Qhipa aru.
There’s barely a lot of money there.	Ukanx juk’akiw walja qullqix utji.
But he couldn't do it.	Ukampis janiw ukanak lurañ puedkänti.
I will do this and no more.	Nayaw uk lurä ukat janiw jukʼamp lurkäti.
And now this film.	Ukat jichhax aka película.
And today it was.	Ukat jichhürunakanxa ukhamänwa.
And I’m like that.	Ukat nayax ukhama.
It’s hard, but it’s worth it.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, ukampis wali askiwa.
Nothing felt right.	Janiw kunas askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
I really want to appreciate it.	Chiqpachansa wali askit uñjañ munta.
So he could have done it.	Ukhamajj jupajj uk luraspänwa.
People seem to like it.	Jaqinakax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
No, not all of these are available.	Janiwa, janiw taqe ukanakajj utjkiti.
He got what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk katoqäna.
This year he’s been pretty good.	Jichha marax jupax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
There was something scary, too.	Mä axsarkañ kunaw utjäna, ukhamaraki.
Someone like them.	Jupanakar uñtasit maynix.
No one wanted to talk about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
But at least it is.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamawa.
If you really want to know, he was a gift to you.	Chiqpachansa yatiñ munsta ukhaxa, jupax jumatakix mä regalo ukhamänwa.
It was something we never did at all.	Ukajj kuntï janipuniw kuns lurapkta ukhamänwa.
Until the little eye.	Jisk’a jisk’a nayra.
I love that question.	Uka jisktʼajj walpun gustitu.
I’m looking forward to that.	Nayax uk suyt’askta.
Until now, he hadn’t.	Jichhakamax janiw ukham lurkänti.
I just felt that way.	Nayax ukhamakiw uka tuqit jikxatasiyäta.
I started small this time.	Nayax aka kutix jisk’a qalltawayta.
One day he can do it.	Mä urux luraspawa.
He could barely speak.	Jupajj jukʼakiw parlañ yatïna.
That’s how things were.	Ukhamaw kunas utjäna.
No really not.	Janiwa chiqpachansa janiwa.
He knew exactly where he wanted it.	Jupajj kawkhansa wal munäna uk sum yatïna.
I have nowhere else to go.	Janiw yaqha cheqar sarañatak utjkituti.
I gave him so much.	Nayajj walpun jupar churta.
There is no such thing.	Ukajj janiw utjkiti.
So far there is nothing for you.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas jumatakix utjkiti.
I didn't think so.	Nayajj janiw ukham amuyirïkti.
I think he was doing that.	Ukham luraskäna sasaw amuyta.
He wanted money badly.	Jupax qullqi jan waliw munäna.
It will take some creative work.	Mä jukʼa lurañanak lurañaw wakisini.
He will not be at home.	Jupajj janiw utan utjkaniti.
She said no thanks.	Jupajj janiw yuspärta sasaw säna.
I just saw it.	Nayax jichhakiw uñjta.
Of course, it could take a few years.	Chiqansa, mä qhawqha maranakaw munasispa.
No one can do anything about it.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkaspati.
It’s a very nice guy.	Mä wali suma jaqiwa.
He was very still and quiet.	Jupax wali amukiw ukat amukiw jikxatasïna.
Very soon, he decided.	Wali jank’akiw sasaw amtäna.
Now this is interesting.	Jichhax akax wali askiwa.
And he didn't want to move.	Ukat janiw yaqha chiqar sarxañ munkänti.
Much more interesting.	Walja juk’ampi suma.
I saw you talking.	Nayax jumar parlir uñjta.
Maybe it’s really bad.	Inas chiqpachansa jan walinak lurañax wakischispa.
There was no need to go.	Janiw sarañajj wakiskänti.
He’s not sure how long it’s been.	Jupax janiw sum yatkiti qawqha pachas ukax utji.
No, there wasn’t anyone at the time.	Janiwa, janiw khitis uka pachanx utjkänti.
I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do.	Nayax llakistwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
They told me it was bad.	Jupanakajj jan wali sasaw sapjjetäna.
And that’s important to you.	Ukat ukax jumatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
And something hit him.	Ukat kunas juparux ch’allt’äna.
He said he wanted to drive.	Ukat auto apnaqañ munta sasaw säna.
And then he started telling me why.	Ukat ukat kunatsa uk yatiyañ qalltäna.
It goes so fast.	Ukham jankʼakiw saraski.
Now I want to live on my own.	Jichhax naya pachpaw jakañ munta.
Of course, that's fine.	Chiqansa, ukax walikïskiwa.

I haven’t seen it lately.	Nayax janiw qhipa urunakanx uñjkti.
I don't really see that happening.	Ukham lurasajj janiw cheqpachapun uñjkti.
I want it immediately.	Nayax jank’akiw munta.
Overall, it doesn’t seem too bad.	Taqi kunat sipansa, janiw sinti jan walinak lurañjamäkiti.
Eventually, something came to him.	Qhepatjja, kunas jupar purinïna.
Always have, always will.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurawayta, sapa kutiw utjani.
This is still the most common.	Akax wali juk’amp uñt’atawa.
And here it was found.	Ukat aka chiqan jikxatasïna.
I thought this would be a good time for that.	Ukatakejj aka tiempojj wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
There was almost nothing.	Niya janiw kunas utjkänti.
This would be very useful to you, very useful.	Ukax jumatakix wali askïspawa, wali askïspawa.
It stirred for a long time.	Ukajj jaya tiempow chʼalljjtayasïna.
Great great great.	Jach’a jach’a jach’a.
It's actually not too bad.	Chiqansa janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
Very, very good	Wali, wali suma .
He wanted a drink at that point.	Jupax uka pachanx umañ munäna.
Next time don't leave it so long.	Jutïr kutin janiw ukham jaya tiempo jaytañamäkiti.

This season has definitely arrived.	Aka pachanx chiqpachapuniw purini.

The day after dinner.	Manq’añ qhipa uru.
It wasn't what he wanted her to be.	Janiw kunjamtï jupar munkäna ukhamäkänti.
It’s even weirder.	Ukax juk’ampi muspharkañawa.
He wanted everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa munäna.
So far, it’s been good.	Jichhakamax, wali askiwa.
If he does something.	Jupax kuns luraspa ukhaxa.
It went with him.	Ukajj jupamp chikaw sarjjäna.
I don’t see when or who he left with.	Kunapachas ni khitimpis sarxäna uk janiw uñjkti.
A very large house.	Mä wali jach’a uta.
And he knew that for sure.	Ukat uk chiqpachapuniw yatïna.
No one understood anything.	Janiw khitis kuns amuykänti.
Things are getting to me.	Kunanakas nayaruw purini.
He knew nothing about such talk.	Ukham parlañ tuqitxa janiw kuns yatkänti.
Of course you can do that.	Chiqpachansa jumax uk lurasma.
So we need to do something about it.	Ukatwa uka toqet kuns lurañasa.
No he didn’t do that.	Janiwa jupax janiw ukham lurkänti.
You think you are someone else.	Jumax yaqha jaqïtawa sasaw amuyta.
He said he told me.	Jupax nayaruw yatiyäta sasaw säna.
Or better yet for that matter.	Jan ukax ukatakix juk’amp askiwa.
I finally did it last year.	Qhipharux nayrïr maraw ukham lurawayta.
I have no idea what’s in it.	Nayax janiw kunas ukan utjki ukx amuykti.
No, that's too far back.	Janiwa, ukajj wali jaya qhepatwa.
It doesn't matter how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
And then there? 	Ukat ukat?
He is a .	Jupax mä .
It’s a quiet night.	Ukax mä llamp’u arumaw.
I often wonder what he is doing now.	Jichhajj kunsa luraski uk sapa kutiw jisktʼasta.
Do what you do well.	Kuntï lurkta uk sum luram.
But he cannot do it on his own.	Ukampis janiw jupa pachpajj uk lurkaspati.
And that was him.	Ukat ukax jupaw utjäna.
But he could do it at any time.	Ukampis kuna horasas jupajj luraspänwa.
The problem is a very important one.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj wali wakiskiriwa.

Let’s take a closer look at this.	Uka tuqitxa wali sum uñjañäni.
Those were the best feelings.	Ukanakaw taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp suma jikjjatasïna.
All of these were found to be important.	Taqi ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa jikxatasïna.
I think you should do that.	Nayax amuyta, jumax ukham lurañamawa.
And here's how it ended.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajj tukuyäna uk uñjañäni.
But he obviously didn't.	Ukampis qhanaw jan ukham lurkänti.
These include the following.	Ukanakax akham sañ muni.
This was indeed a long time ago.	Ukajj cheqapuniw nayra tiempon pasäna.
He just told me he wanted to see it soon.	Jichhakiw jankʼak uñjañ munta sasaw sitäna.
Something called him.	Kunas jupar jawsäna.
I don’t know anything, really.	Janiw kuns yatkti, chiqpachansa.
I don’t really mean that.	Janiw cheqpachapun ukham sañ munkti.
One more week, two more.	Mä semana juk’ampi, pä semana juk’ampi.
He told me all about it.	Taqi ukanak yatiyäna.
He asked for help himself.	Jupa pachpaw yanaptʼa mayïna.
They seemed doable.	Jupanakajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
It’s so amazing.	Ukhama muspharkañawa.

They have nothing to do with it.	Jupanakax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
It’s always been there.	Ukax nayratpachaw utjäna.
But still that doesn’t work.	Ukampis wali ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
And that, and that.	Ukat ukax, ukat ukax.
Very, very hard feeling.	Wali, wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
I'm going to learn more today.	Nayax jichhürunakanx juk'amp yatxatañ munta.

I don’t want anything from him.	Janiw jupat kuns munkti.
I thought that was kind of weird.	Ukajj mä jukʼa muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Let’s do it again.	Uk mayamp lurañäni.
He was really quite .	Jupajj cheqapuniw wali .
And as it turns out.	Ukat kunjamtï ukhamäki ukhama.
I want real money.	Chiqpach qullqi munta.
That’s all that happened.	Ukaw taqe kunas pasäna.

But once in a while it would be worth it.	Ukampis mä kutix wali askïspawa.
Before that, there was nothing.	Janïr ukajj paskäna ukhajja, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He spoke for himself.	Jupa pachpaw parläna.
I didn't realize it at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw uk amuykayätti.

He was still not sleeping well.	Jupajj wali jan sum ikiskäna.

I thought it was everything.	Nayax taqi kunaw sasaw amuyayäta.
He makes the best out of everything.	Jupajj taqe kunatï utjki ukanakat sumwa luri.
He threw it away.	Jupajj uk jaqontäna.
There’s a part of me that wants to talk.	Nayan mä chiqaw utji ukax parlañ muni.
I just can’t find him.	Nayax juparux janiw jikxatkti.
That and that and that.	Uka ukat ukat uka.
The process took a year.	Uka lurañatakejj mä maraw munasïna.
I know it’s been a really long time but this happened.	Nayax yattwa chiqpachans jaya pachaw ukampis akax ukhamaw pasäna.
The man was in a state of shock.	Uka jaqejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
There was no time to go to school.	Yatiqañ utar sarañatakix janiw tiempox utjkänti.
He left something behind.	Jupax kuns jaytawayi.
Why, this is what I like.	Kunatsa, akax nayatakix wali askiwa.
That’s how he feels.	Ukhamaw jupax ukham jikxatasi.
I know you know how it feels.	Nayax yattwa jumax kunjams jikxatasi uk yatta.
I don’t think it’s anywhere in there.	Nayax janiw uka chiqanx kawkhans utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
I just hope so.	Nayax ukhamakiw suyt’ta.
He has always said so.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham säna.
I’m about to arrive and.	Nayax niyaw puriñ yatta ukat...
No, no, don't do it.	Janiw, jan, jan luramti.
There will be plenty of time.	Ukanjja, walja tiempow utjani.
I'm doing better.	Nayax juk'amp sum luraskta.
Hope to see you soon.	Jumanakar jankʼak uñjañ suytʼaskta.
He didn't quite know how.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa uk sum yatkänti.
Everything looks good.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw uñtasi.
We’re the ones who are.	Jiwasajj ukhamawa.
He took one out.	Jupajj mä apsüna.
It’s all very quick.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw.
No one else can do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It is one of the things you need.	Ukajj kunatï jumatak wakiski ukanakat maynïriwa.
I don't know too much about it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw uka toqet sinti sum yatkti.
Everything now has a new perspective.	Jichhax taqi kunas machaq amuyumpiw uñjasi.
There were many things.	Walja kunaw utjäna.
He was partially right.	Jupajj mä jukʼa cheqapuniw säna.
What a wonderful thing!!!.	Kunas wali suma!!!.
He shook it hard.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw ch’allxtayäna.
I'm going to say it very well.	Nayajj wali sumwa sista.
He did something.	Jupajj kunsa luräna.
It’s impossible to say.	Janiw sañjamäkiti.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Inas walja, inas mä juk’a.
This place is very comfortable.	Aka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
I loved it and loved it again.	Nayax walpun munasta ukat ukax wasitat munasiñampiw uñjasi.
Another construction site.	Yaqha lurañ uta.
And it’s very quiet.	Ukat wali amukiw.
He knew he was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa uk sum yatïna.
She longed to talk to him.	Jupampiw jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
But he knew it before he said it.	Ukampis janïr siskäna ukhaw uk yatïna.
It wasn't like that for me before.	Nayrajj janiw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.
Not so today.	Janiw jichhürunakan ukhamäkiti.
It actually happened.	Chiqpachansa ukax pasäna.
That will take some time.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow pasani.
They know the rules.	Jupanakax kamachinak yatipxi.
I don’t see it that way.	Janiw nayax ukham uñjkti.
At that time, too.	Uka tiemponjja, ukhamaraki.
I feel like this all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham jikxatastxa.
But he didn't like it.	Ukampis janiw ukajj gustkänti.
But he got there late.	Ukampis qhepatwa uka cheqar purinïna.
But right now, these are not available.	Ukampis jichhax janiw ukanak lurañax utjkiti.
You absolutely can.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurasma.
He refused to draw attention to it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit amuytʼayañ munkänti.
I really struggled for a while.	Chiqpachansa mä qhawqha tiempow chʼamachasiyäta.
That was a wonderful experience for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.
Today, nothing in the area does that.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw kunas uka cheqan ukham lurkiti.
It has everything a person could want.	Ukanjja, taqe kunatï mä jaqejj munkaspa ukanakaw utji.
Let us do what we can to help.	Yanaptʼañatakejj kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañäni.
It is worth going there.	Ukar sarañajj wali askiwa.
There is no time for that.	Ukatakix janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
He’s decided not to do it.	Jupax jan lurañ amtawayi.
He can do it inside.	Jupax manqhan luraspawa.
He was sad, sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna, llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I hope none of this happens.	Nayax suyt’twa janiw kunas aka tuqitx utjkaspati.
She wondered if he knew.	Uk yatpachati sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Of course, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw jan utjkiti sañ munkiti.
And for you too, obviously.	Ukat jumatakix ukhamaraki, qhanawa.
I can't have that.	Janiw nayajj ukham utjkaspati.
These are fun things.	Ukanakax kusiskañawa.
I absolutely love beer.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw cerveza ukarux walpun munasta.
You know how I feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk jumajj yatisktawa.
That wouldn't be a problem.	Ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
And you can do it twice.	Ukat pä kutiw uk lurasma.
So he wanted to talk to me.	Ukatwa nayamp parltʼañ munäna.
I didn't want it too much.	Nayajj janiw sinti munkayätti.
Which you may or may not like.	Ukax inas jumax munsta jan ukax jan munsta.
I really want to do that.	Nayax uk lurañ walpun munta.
Maybe a new one every week.	Inas sapa semana mä machaq lurañax wakischispa.
The working day.	Uka irnaqäw urux.
I don’t know what exactly.	Janiw kunas chiqpachapunix uk yatkti.
It’s a very old school look.	Ukax mä wali nayra yatiqañ utan uñtatawa.
What are you doing here the longest? 	¿Kunsa jumax akan jukʼamp tiempo luraskta?
Something I don’t want to do.	Kunatix nayax jan lurañ munkta ukawa.
He was a tall man.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqënwa.
He didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
It was getting worse every week.	Sapa semanaw jukʼamp jan walinak luraskäna.
I don't remember that.	Nayajj janiw uk amtaskti.
You know it doesn’t.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't want to go anywhere else.	Jupajj janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ munkänti.
He watched them silently.	Jupajj amukiw jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
He seemed to want to tell her something.	Jupajj kuns yatiyañ munkaspa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
Every once in a while he’ll do something very wrong.	Sapa kutiw jupax wali jan walinak lurani.
But maybe they are.	Ukampis inas jupanakax.
No, better not.	Janiwa, juk’amp askiwa jan ukax.
You ask him the question.	Jumaw jupar jisktʼasta.
It’s amazing, it’s amazing.	Ukax muspharkañawa, wali muspharkañawa.
Or maybe someone else.	Jan ukajj mayniw ukham luraspa.
Everything is not good for you.	Taqi kunas janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
I asked him if he was really okay.	Chiqpachansa walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼta.
He looked at her and quickly walked away.	Jupajj uñchʼukiskäna ukat jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
But what happened went much faster than that.	Ukampis kunatï paskäna ukajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp jankʼakiw saräna.
So he walked away.	Ukatwa jupajj sarnaqäna.
So now it took a long time.	Ukhamajj jichhajj walja tiempow munasïna.
There was everything.	Ukanjja, taqe kunaw utjäna.
I’m building a house.	Nayax mä uta luraskta.
But it’s still beautiful!.	Ukampis ¡wali sumawa!.
He knows what the future holds.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk sum yati.
He’s pretty good about it.	Jupax wali sumaw uka tuqitxa.
Not two of them.	Janiw pä.
I personally never thought of anyone that way.	Naya pachpaw janipuniw khitirus ukham amuyirïkti.
He wanted to know who the man was.	Uka jaqejj khitïnsa uk yatiñwa munäna.
It’s a young guy.	Mä waynax wali ch’amawa.
He’s doing great, he’s in great shape.	Jupax wali sum luraski, jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
I don't think that's really how you feel.	Chiqpachansa kunjamsa jikxatasïta ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
It’s almost too good to be true.	Niya wali sumaw jikxatasi.
That’s what’s doing the work.	Ukaw lurañanak luraski.
I’m not sure, but maybe.	Nayax janiw yatkti, ukampis inas.
It was always there.	Ukajj sapa kutiw utjäna.
And you really, really get it.	Ukat jumax chiqpachapuniw, chiqpachapuniw jikxatastaxa.
It only exists once.	Mä kutikiw utji.
But you can do it alone.	Ukampis juma sapakiw ukham lurasma.
And there now, he saw it.	Ukat ukan jichhax, jupax uñjäna.
I made the bed.	Nayax ikiñ lurawayta.
Not yet thirty.	Janiw jichhakamax kimsa tunk.
He lived with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw jakasïna.
That really started things.	Ukaw chiqpachansa kuns qalltäna.
He says he wants the job.	Jupax uka irnaqäw munta sasaw saraki.
And so he watched.	Ukat ukhamaw jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.
Now tell me what happened.	Jichhax kunas pasäna uk yatiyapxita.
A year or two.	Mä mara jan ukax pä mara.
It’s been a lot of fun this evening.	Jichha jayp’ux wali kusiskañawa.
It was great the first time.	Nayrïr kutin wali sumapunïnwa.
It’s a good thing .	Ukax wali askiwa .
He’s kind of old school like that.	Jupax mä kasta nayra yatiqañ utan ukham uñt’atawa.
He’s already doing everything right.	Jupax niyaw taqi kuns sum luraski.
He immediately asked who had done it.	Ukat jankʼakiw khitis ukanak lurawayi sasaw jisktʼäna.
Why the question arises.	Kunatsa uka jisktʼajj utji.
But I didn't do anything.	Ukampis nayajj janiw kuns lurkti.
I don't know anything else about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw yaqha tuqit yatkti.
I don't believe what he says.	Kuntï siski uk janiw creykti.
Just this morning.	Jichha alwax ukhamakiw.
I’ve actually done both.	Nayax chiqpachansa panpachaniw lurawayta.
It wants to go with you.	Ukax jumamp chika sarañ muni.
Someone saw him.	Mayniw jupar uñjäna.
He learned how to let go of some control.	Kunjamsa mä jukʼa apnaqañ jaytañ yateqäna.
We have doubts about it.	Jiwasax pächastwa.
And that's not really a problem for me.	Ukat ukax janiw chiqpachansa nayatakix kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I mean really really bad.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa jan wali sañ munta.
The time is ten o'clock.	Uka pachax tunka pacharuw purini.
And how you want to talk.	Ukat kunjamsa jumax parlañ munta.
Or me, anyway.	Jan ukajj nayajj, kunjamatsa.
This may take more or less time.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp jan ukajj jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
I think that was what he did well.	Kuntï jupajj sum lurkäna ukajj ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
He worked very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa irnaqäna.
It’s not impossible.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
And there will be nothing to do.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas utjkaniti.
I still want to see you.	Wali munasiñampiw uñjañ munta.
But the word, the word.	Ukampis uka aru, uka aru.
This one is like that.	Aka maynix ukhamawa.
A little bit of a little bit.	Mä jisk’a jisk’a jisk’a.
That is your responsibility.	Ukajj jumanakan lurañamawa.
But now he is silent.	Ukampis jichhax amukiw jikxatasi.
But it is better than mine.	Ukampis nayat sipansa walikïskiwa.
I always want to do better.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp sum lurañ munta.
Everything is so quick.	Taqi kunas ukhama jank’akiw.
We'll see how it goes tomorrow.	Qharürojj kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
So far, the results have been impressive.	Jichhakamax ukax wali muspharkañawa.
He slammed the door.	Jupax punku ch’allxtayäna.
You have to be right.	Chiqaw sañama.
It goes again.	Ukax wasitatwa saraski.
He talked too much.	Jupax sinti parläna.
There’s plenty of time now.	Jichhax walja pachaw utji.
I know what this is.	Nayax yattwa kunas akax ukxa.
I can’t say when it really started.	Kunapachas chiqpachapuni qalltäna uk janiw siskti.
So it is and it is not.	Ukhamajj ukhamawa ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I’m going anyway.	Nayax kunjamatsa saraskta.
But the point was clear.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I don't intend to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ amtkti.
He was who he was.	Jupaw khitïnsa ukjja.
He knew all about it.	Jupajj uka toqet taqe chuymaw yatïna.
It really worked with him.	Chiqpachansa, jupampiw irnaqäna.
He had everybody.	Jupajj taqeniw utjäna.
He wanted to drink it.	Jupajj ukanak umañ munäna.
In fact, almost everything is about me.	Chiqansa, niya taqi kunaw nayat utji.
She told him she was happy.	Jupajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw jupar säna.
But something was still staring.	Ukampis kunas wali uñchʼukiskäna.
We can’t do it.	Jiwasax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
What he meant to say.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna ukjja.
He just loves it.	Jupax ukhamakiw munasi.
Later in the month.	Uka phaxsinx qhipharux.
The night is beautiful.	Arumax wali sumawa.
You’re going to do great.	Jumax wali jach’a lurañamawa.
That is exactly what he wants to do.	Uka pachpaw jupajj lurañ muni.
I don’t go by car.	Janiw autot sarkti.
Everyone in this world is an individual.	Aka pachanx taqiniw sapa maynix utji.
I think he knew that day.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uka uruw uk yatïna.
I have my own existence.	Naya pachpaw utjitu.
I asked him how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta sasaw jisktʼasta.
He loved the country the most.	Jupajj uka markaruw jukʼamp munasïna.
And today was the day.	Ukat jichhüruw uka urux utjäna.
He had just gone to bed.	Jupax jichhakiw ikiñar sarxäna.
I really want to do that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurañ munta.
I don’t think of anything.	Nayax janiw kuns amuyta.
Perhaps he could have done better somewhere.	Inas kawkhansa jukʼamp sum luraspäna.
We are the .	Jiwasax uka .
I like it too, too.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw gustitu.
I think that’s obvious.	Nayax amuyta ukax qhanawa.
And there was no problem.	Ukat janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
But time is limited as you say.	Ukampis tiempox jukʼakiw kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhama.
So the timing is right.	Ukhamajj tiempojj walikïskiwa.
He just lives here.	Jupax ukhamakiw akan jakasi.
He was like, you know.	Jupax ukhamänwa, jumax yatisktawa.
Do one, do it well and that’s it.	Mä luram, wali sum luram ukat ukax ukhamawa.
It may take a long time.	Inas walja tiempo munasispa.
He didn't know what was happening to him.	Jupajj janiw kunas jupar paskäna uk yatkänti.
Maybe you’re the same.	Inas jumax ukhamaraki.
So there is nothing to it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas ukajj utjkiti.
He gave it to her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar churäna.
We’ll do that again.	Jiwasax wasitat ukham lurañäni.
But he did it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
And so beautiful.	Ukat ukhama suma.
A very cold night.	Mä wali thaya arumaw.
It’s the one who.	Ukax khititix.
Why thank you so much.	Kunatsa wal yuspärta.
I don't believe it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukar creykti.
Of course, for one thing he didn't realize it.	Chiqansa, mä tuqitxa janiw uk amuyaskänti.
I don’t know why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa ukham lurkti.
So he wanted to go one last time.	Ukatwa qhepa kutin sarañ munäna.
He was very positive about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa arsüna.
I love him so much.	Nayajj jupar wal munta.
And that one.	Ukat uka maynix.
I had no idea about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet amuykayätti.
Except, of course, it wasn’t.	Jan ukasti, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I felt a little uncomfortable.	Nayax mä juk’a jan waliw jikxatasïna.
And it took a lot of work.	Ukat walja lurañaw wakisïna.
He was, but it wasn’t.	Jupaw, ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
You are not in this country.	Jumax janiw aka markan utjkiti.
He thought something had happened.	Kunas pasäna sasaw amuyäna.
I’m sorry, but that’s it.	Nayax llakistwa, ukampis ukhamawa.
Then it started to rain.	Ukat jallu puriñ qalltäna.
It’s the same old, same old.	Ukax pachpa nayra, pachpa nayra.
So it really comes down to it.	Ukhamajj chiqpachansa ukaruw puri.
And he really felt like he couldn't do anything about it.	Ukat chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
But it's okay that you didn't.	Ukampis jan ukham lurapkta ukajj walikïskiwa.
He was too good to do that.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I want to know what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk yatiñ munta.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
He couldn't say her name right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj sutip arsuñ puedkänti.
But that is clearly not the case.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
I'm more worried than you are.	Nayajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqit jan walïkiti uk sum yatkti.
There is nowhere to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañatak utjkiti.
And there seems to be nothing you can do.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
Hearing this, he was silent.	Uk istʼasajj amukiw jikjjatasïna.
How did you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna.
You’re the one who told me.	Jumaw yatiyäta.
Of course, this person is nowhere to be found.	Chiqansa, aka jaqix janiw kawkhans utjkiti.
And he asked why.	Ukat kunatsa uk jisktʼäna.
You don’t really like me.	Jumax janiw chiqpachapunix nayar munktati.
You don’t need to do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañax wakiskiti.
That can happen tomorrow.	Ukaw qhipürux pasaspa.
I am so glad to hear from you.	Jumanakat istʼasajj walpun kusista.
I really want to go there soon.	Ukar jankʼak sarañ wal munta.
He knew what that felt like.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
I’m from the area.	Nayax uka chiqat jutta.
I’m the only one who knows.	Naya sapakiw yatta.
I like to do that.	Ukham lurañax nayatakix wali askiwa.
And a year.	Ukat mä mara.
I didn’t know how to reach him.	Janiw kunjamsa jupar puriñ yatkayätti.
He says no, everything is fine.	Jupax janiw, taqi kunas walikïskiwa sasaw saraki.
I want to tell you all the truth, now.	Nayax taqiniruw chiqpach arsuñ munta, jichhax.
He realized this immediately.	Ukjja, jankʼakiw amuyasïna.
That’s going to me.	Ukax nayaruw saraski.
At the moment this is what it looks like.	Jichha pachanx akax akham sañ muni.
Here 's what's going on.	Akax 'kunas pasaski ukawa.
I didn't know it well before.	Nayrajj janiw sum yatkayätti.
And he knew that nothing would happen.	Ukat janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw jupajj sum yatïna.
He improved but not all.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna ukampis janiw taqe kuns lurkänti.
It’s better now.	Jichhax juk’amp sumawa.
Instead of doing that.	Uk lurañat sipansa.
I think he’s getting better.	Nayax amuyta, jupax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
I know what he wants.	Nayajj kuntï jupajj munki uk yattwa.
Everyone except him.	Taqinipuniw jupat sipansa.
He doesn’t need that right now.	Jupax janiw jichhax ukax wakiskiti.
But that doesn't mean it wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukajj utjkänti sañ munkiti.
But here’s the look.	Ukampis akham uñjañäni.
A much better one.	Mä juk’amp suma.
But it still feels good.	Ukampis wali sumaw jikjjatasi.
Nothing like that here.	Janiw kunas ukham akanx utjkiti.
Many people have nothing.	Walja jaqenakajj janiw kunas utjkiti.
He still wants to sleep.	Jupax wali ikiñ munaraki.
He didn't know how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw yatkänti.
Very very impressive.	Wali wali muspharkañawa.
I think he was disappointed.	Nayax amuyta, jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
You know you can’t do it.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw lurañjamäkiti.
At this point it really didn’t matter to him.	Aka pachanx chiqpachansa janiw juparux kuns lurkänti.
I still feel comfortable there.	Ukanjja wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
You look familiar.	Jumax uñt’at uñnaqaniwa.

Someone is waiting.	Mayniw suyt’aski.
He loved the day.	Jupax uka urux walpun munäna.
He gave the gift.	Jupaw uka regalo churäna.
It’s not bad, it’s fine.	Janiw jan walïkiti, walikïskiwa.
But I don't know.	Ukampis janiw yatkti.
He would have nothing.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkaspati.
Whether that spoke to his feelings or not, he didn't know.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk parläna jan ukajj janicha uk janiw yatkänti.
He is very tall, quiet and awkward.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa, amukiw ukat jan wali jaqiwa.
It was quiet here.	Aka chiqanx amukiw jikxatasïna.
Yes, he does that.	Jïsa, jupaw ukham luri.
So that's pretty cool.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali sumawa.
I'm doing that right now.	Jichhajj ukham luraskta.
Nothing has ever happened before.	Janiw kunas nayrax utjkänti.
I haven’t done anything about it for nearly twenty years.	Nayax niya pä tunk maraw uka tuqitx jan kuns lurkti.
But he said it very cautiously.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw säna.
Or, or it wasn't.	Jan ukajj, jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Of course I know.	Chiqansa nayax yatxatwa.
They had no reason to.	Jupanakajj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.

And there’s a place for that.	Ukat ukax mä chiqaw utji.
I think that’s a great part.	Nayax ukax wali jach’a chiqaw sasaw amuyta.
He doesn’t know exactly where he is.	Jupax janiw kawkhans jikxatasi uk sum yatkiti.
He does, but rarely.	Jupax uk luri, ukampis jukʼakiw ukham luri.
Maybe one day I hope to say it again.	Inas mä urux wasitat arsuñ suyt’askta.
You know, how do you do that? 	Jumax yatisktawa, ¿kunjamsa uk lurasma?
Once he knew the truth, he knew what to do about it.	Mä kutix chiqpach yatïna ukhaxa, kunsa uka tuqit lurañapa uk yatïna.
They don’t matter here.	Jupanakax janiw akanx kunäkisa.
That's going to happen soon.	Ukajj niyaw pasani.
Which is what he meant.	Ukajj kuntï sañ munkäna ukawa.
This is even more evident today.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj jukʼamp qhanaw uñjasi.
He just came to me.	Jupajj jichhakiw nayar jutäna.
Maybe one doesn’t exist.	Inas maynix jan utjkaspati.
Only he can do it today.	Jupa sapakiw jichhürunakan luraspa.
What he is doing at the time is irrelevant.	Uka tiempon kuntï jupajj luraski ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He felt that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He died the way he wanted to.	Jupajj kunjamtï munkäna ukhamaw jiwjjäna.
Everything he told me over the years.	Taqi kuntï jupax walja maranakaw nayar sitäna.
And it looks great, too.	Ukat wali sumaw uñtasi, ukhamaraki.
I want to take him out.	Nayajj jupar apsuñ munta.
Maybe it’s the money.	Inas uka qullqix utjaspa.
It didn’t last long.	Janiw jaya pachax utjkänti.
But that was the only one.	Ukampis uka sapakiw utjäna.
He goes everywhere with me.	Jupax nayamp chikaw taqi chiqar saraski.

It’s pretty obvious now.	Jichhax wali qhanaw uñjasi.
Well, yes it was.	Ukhama, jïsa ukhamänwa.
You just have to do it.	Jumax ukhamakiw lurañama.
I think that’s about him.	Nayax jupat ukham amuyta.
He did not know who the man was.	Jupajj janiw khitïnsa uka jaqejj uk yatkänti.
Two hours later.	Pä horanak qhepatjja.
That’s how it goes with him.	Ukhamaw jupamp chika saraski.

I wanted to know if that worked.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk yatiñ munta.
A little bit more and more.	Mä juk’ampi juk’ampi.
Everything is amazing there.	Ukanjja, taqe kunas wali muspharkañawa.
Maybe he’ll get through somehow.	Inas jupax kunjamatsa pasaspa.
No one wanted that.	Janiw khitis uk munkänti.
Of course, that’s what it is.	Chiqansa, ukax ukhamawa.
It doesn't matter what happened before.	Kunas nayrajj pasäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He is a young man.	Jupajj mä waynawa.
And that goes to make a good film.	Ukat ukax mä suma película lurañatakiw saraski.
Now it was real.	Jichhajj cheqpach ukhamänwa.
He was the first to do so.	Jupaw nayraqat ukham luräna.
That or the word.	Uka jan ukax aru.
Not yet available to me.	Janiw jichhakamax nayatakix utjkiti.
Never do something twice.	Janipuniw pä kuti kuns lurañamäkiti.
And that’s exactly what he’ll do.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax lurani.
It just arrived.	Jichhakiw purinïna.
He never goes to school.	Jupax janipuniw yatiqañ utar sarkiti.
He stayed there for an hour.	Jupajj mä horaw ukan qheparäna.
I mean here.	Nayax akan sañ munta.
He knew he had to act quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañapa uk sum yatïna.
Today, there is something more important to do.	Jichhürunakanjja, jukʼamp wakiskir lurañaw utji.
You have to do it yourself.	Jumaw uk lurañama.
I want that person.	Nayax uka jaqiruw munta.
He couldn't stay.	Jupajj janiw qheparañ puedkänti.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Janiw ukhamäkiti janicha uk yatkti.

What is happening to me.	Kunas nayar pasaski ukajja.
Everything was excellent .	Taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa .
Breakfast is acceptable.	Desayuno ukax walikïskiwa.
I’ve only done this a couple of times.	Mä pä kutikiw ukham lurawayta.
This looks great.	Akax wali suma uñtatawa.
Don’t leave anything out.	Janiw kuns jaytañamäkiti.
He didn't want to go to me.	Jupajj janiw nayar sarañ munkänti.
Something else can happen.	Yaqha kunaw pasaspa.
I'm a little worried myself.	Naya pachpaw mä jukʼa llakista.
He knew what to do.	Kun lurañsa yatïna.
So it never happens.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Tell us about him.	Jupat yatiyapjjeta.
I know who this person is.	Nayajj khitis aka jaqejj uk yattwa.
Don’t give up, ever.	Janiw jaytañamäkiti, janipuniw.
He did this for three years.	Ukjja kimsa maraw luräna.
This is amazing.	Akax muspharkañawa.
I only feed them once a week.	Semanan mä kutikiw manqʼa churta.
It should do this very well .	Ukham lurañax wali sum lurañapawa .
He refused to take it.	Jupajj janiw uka apsuñ munkänti.
Whatever you think happened.	Kunatï amuyki ukajj pasäna.
He wondered what would happen to him now.	Jichhajj kunas jupar pasani sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Every moment is beautiful.	Sapa pachax wali sumawa.
And he likes it that way.	Ukat juparux ukham gusti.
I have heard this many times.	Ukjja walja kutiw istʼta.
I don’t want anyone.	Janiw khitirus munkti.
He hasn’t done it in a while.	Jupax mä juk’a pachaw jan uk lurkiti.
The man stared at her for a long time.	Uka jaqejj walja tiempow jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
No, he understood what was happening.	Janiwa, kunatï paskäna uk sum amuyäna.
I don’t recognize this by any means.	Nayax janiw kuna tuqitsa akax uñt’kti.
Of course, there can be nothing wrong with that.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas utjkaspati.
No, that's a good thing.	Janiwa, ukajj wali askiwa.
I don't know any more.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp yatkti.
I see him with you.	Nayax jumamp chikaw jupar uñjta.

Except it’s pretty good, too.	Jan ukasti wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
He knows exactly what you want.	Jupajj kuntï munkta uk sum yati.
He spoke the truth.	Jupaw uka cheq parläna.
I never knew how.	Kunjamsa uk janipuniw yatkti.
And there was no he.	Ukat janiw mä jupajj utjkänti.
I’ve said this before.	Nayax nayrax ukham arsuwayta.
He said, he said that.	Jupax akham sänwa, jupax ukham sänwa.
It was a wonderful night.	Ukajj wali suma arumaw utjäna.
There is nothing whatsoever.	Janiw kunas kunas utjkiti.
I don’t want to leave him.	Janiw jupar jaytañ munkti.
We can’t have that.	Jiwasax janiw ukax utjkaspati.
He didn't realize this could happen .	Ukham lurasajj ukham pasaspa uk janiw amuyaskänti .
I feel that this is the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa sasaw amuyasta.
He was a little .	Jupajj mä jukʼa .
But I know that.	Ukampis uk yattwa.
There is nothing much to do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas sinti lurañax utjkiti.
I wanted to do this earlier, but I didn’t know how.	Nayax nayraw uk lurañ munta, ukampis kunjamsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
I kind of thought he could.	Mä jukʼa jupajj uk luraspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Instead , you	Jan ukasti jumaw .
And it started working.	Ukat ukax irnaqañ qalltäna.
I just realized this a few days ago.	Jichhakiw mä qhawqha urunak nayrajj uk amuyayäta.
I want something.	Nayax kuns munta.
That is what he does best.	Ukaw jupajj jukʼamp sum luri.
I feel that way myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham jikjjatasta.
I think someone did something to him.	Nayax amuyta, mayniw juparux kuns luratayna.
Now the night is coming.	Jichhajj arumaw purini.
He can do whatever he wants, however he wants, right now.	Jupax kuntï munki uk luraspa, kunjamtï munki ukhama, jichhax luraspa.
He asked to accompany her in the morning.	Jupajj alwajj jupamp chik sarañatakiw mayïna.
I absolutely love it!.	¡Nayax wali munasiñampiw uñjta!.
I can see why he thought that.	Kunatsa ukham amuyäna uk sum uñjta.
He is a wicked man.	Jupajj jan wali lurir jaqewa.
It does a lot of stuff.	Walja yänak luraski.
Whatever you want.	Kunatix munkta ukax.
It’s a gift to me.	Nayatakix mä regalo.
This is going to be long.	Akax jaya pachaw saraski.
And there is no reason.	Ukat janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
He was very tall, very thin.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqënwa, wali jiskʼa jaqënwa.
But, it felt good.	Ukampis, wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
That means he is.	Ukajj jupaw sañ muni.
It feels very light and lasts all day.	Ukajj wali qhanaw jikjjatasi ukat urunakpachaw utji.
I think he knows where this is going.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kawkirus akax saraski uk yati.
Don’t have this, because I think it’s really important.	Janiw akax utjkiti, kunatix nayatakix chiqpachans wali wakiskiriwa.
He said he understood that.	Uk amuyasta sasaw säna.
I was really happy and excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
The amount of money .	Uka qullqix .
But he always refused.	Ukampis sapa kutiw jan munkänti.
I haven't seen anything myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw kuns uñjkti.
I’m he was like that.	Nayax jupax ukhamänwa.
But he has no idea what happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna uk janiw jupajj amuykiti.
I don't want to say any more about it.	Janiw uka toqet jukʼamp arsuñ munkti.
This is very important because there is no time limit.	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa kunatix janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
Honestly, it doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukax kunäkisa.
I fell in love with him at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, jupat walpun munasta.
He said no, the only one, and that was it.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna, mä sapakiw säna, ukajj ukhamänwa.
I remember that better.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumwa amtasta.
But he’s not, of course.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
And to me that says a lot.	Ukat nayatakix ukax walpun arsu.
I really have no idea what this is.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas akax ukx amuykti.
There’s nothing I can do for him.	Janiw kunas jupatak lurañjamäkiti.
Don't you.	Janit jumax.
Hope to see you there!.	¡Ukan jumanakar uñjañ suyt'askta!.
No not really.	Janiwa janiwa chiqpachansa.
I don't know, and it doesn't matter to me.	Janiw uk yatkti, ukat nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ukham lurasiñap yatiyätwa.
He didn’t say anything that first time.	Janiw uka nayrïr kutix kuns arskänti.
Be passionate about what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta ukaruw taqe chuyma chʼamachasiñama.
We’ll do something else.	Jiwasax yaqha lurañanak lurañäni.
Therefore, there was no problem.	Ukatwa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I’m not saying I have anything to do with it.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjitu sañ munkti.
That could be the case.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw utjaspa.
I’m feeling alone.	Nayax sapakiw jikxatastxa.
Happy New Year to you all.	Machaq marax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
Time they didn’t have.	Tiempo jupanakax janiw utjkänti.
I don’t think he ever really understood that.	Janiw kunapachas uka tuqit chiqpachapuni amuyaskänti sasaw amuyta.
Ultimately, legislation needs to be created.	Qhipharux kamachinak lurañaw wakisi.
He agreed with her.	Jupajj jupamp chikaw iyaw säna.
The weather was perfect.	Pachax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
Let’s see what it says there.	Ukan kuns siski uk uñjañäni.
And he never really understood.	Ukat janipuniw chiqpachapunix amuyaskänti.
That was a long time ago.	Ukajj walja tiempo nayraw pasäna.
He rides there all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uka cheqan kayuk saraski.
I won’t do it any other way now.	Jichhax janiw yaqha tuqit lurkäti.
That’s what he knows.	Uk jupax yati.
I don’t know how to do it.	Janiw lurañ yatkti.
I didn't want to take it.	Nayajj janiw ukanak apsuñ munkayätti.
It’s just been an amazing day.	Mä muspharkañ urux ukhamakiw utjawayi.
That’s what’s happening.	Ukaw pasaski.
It’s funny, one doesn’t know the other.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, maynix maynix janiw yatkiti.
It’s finally recognized.	Ukax qhipharux uñt’atawa.
There was something there.	Ukanjja, kunas utjäna.
It’s a good film.	Mä suma película.
You can do that.	Jumax ukham lurasma.
It was already like that.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa.
I knew exactly how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk sum yatiyäta.
This will obviously take time.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasini, ukajj qhanawa.
So he loved it.	Ukhamajj jupajj wal munasïna.
He said he only saw it once.	Mä kutikiw uñjta sasaw säna.
Or so he thought he could.	Jan ukajj ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
I don't know how I feel about him.	Jupat kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk janiw yatkti.
But he did no more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
It wasn’t before time.	Janiw janïr pachax utjkänti.
And it’s so small.	Ukat ukhama jisk’a.
There may never be another opportunity like this again.	Inas janipuniw mayamps ukham yaqha oportunidad utjkaspati.
No one can do much about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw khitis wal lurkaspati.
I’m interested in this.	Nayax aka tuqitx wali askiwa.
I’m sure you know about it.	Nayax yatxatwa jumax uka tuqit yatisktawa.
I could never imagine stuff like that.	Janipuniw ukham yänak amuytʼirjamäkti.
So it's not too bad.	Ukhamajj janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
And thank you again.	Ukat mayamp yuspärta.
That’s a nice little bit.	Ukax mä suma jisk’a jisk’a.
You just can’t do that.	Jumax ukhamakiw ukham lurasma.
You're there still.	Jumax ukan wali.
That he didn't have.	Ukajj janiw jupan utjkänti.
No one understands anything.	Janiw khitis kuns amuykiti.
He didn’t know where to go home.	Utar kawkirus sarañapa uk janiw yatkänti.
I tried really hard.	Chiqpachansa wal chʼamachasiyäta.
It’s just that bad.	Ukax ukhamakiw jan wali.
There is no precedent.	Janiw kuna nayra pachas utjkiti.
I know what you are doing tonight.	Kuntï jichha arumax lurapkta uk yattwa.

That’s really what it was.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamänwa.
And that will have to be done.	Ukat ukax lurañaw wakisini.
So it doesn't mean who he was.	Ukhamajj janiw khitïnsa uk sañ munkiti.
Nothing for you whatsoever.	Janiw kunas jumatakix kunas.
When, he didn’t know.	Kunapachas, jupax janiw yatkänti.
But, obviously not.	Ukampis, qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
But there’s one place where it’s not.	Ukampis mä chiqaw utji, ukanx janiw ukhamäkiti.
But you may have to go in secret.	Ukampis inas jamasat sarañax wakischispa.
A lot more money.	Walja juk’ampi qullqi.
So that's what he could do.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj luraspäna.
But what .	Ukampis kunas .
I thought, no.	Nayax akham amuyta, janiwa.
There is no one like me.	Janiw khitis nayat sipan utjkiti.
No one knows everything.	Janiw khitis taqi kun yatkiti.
About how he looked now.	Kunjamsa jichhajj uñnaqäna uka toqetwa.
Maybe you need someone to do it for you.	Inas maynix jumatakix lurañapatak wakischispa.
He’s a different person now.	Jupax jichhax yaqha jaqiwa.
But I have no idea how that can happen.	Ukampis kunjamsa ukham pasaspa uk janiw amuykti.
But it was still worth it.	Ukampis wali askiwa.
And waiting a year.	Ukat mä maraw suytʼaski.
I don’t think there is one.	Nayax janiw mä utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
It’s very difficult to do well.	Suma lurañax wali ch’amawa.
I just mentioned this.	Nayax jichhakiw uka tuqit arsuwayta.
It shook me up a bit.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’allxtayäna.
He desperately wanted to go back to sleep.	Jupax walpun wasitat ikiñar sarañ munäna.
It took hours and hours.	Walja horanakaw ukat walja horanakaw munasïna.
Now I can see that clearly.	Jichhajj uk sum uñjta.
But beyond that, it’s wrong.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw walïkiti.
But he was still trying.	Ukampis wali chʼamampiw chʼamachasïna.
I tend to agree on both.	Nayax panpachaniw uka tuqit mä amtar puriñ yatta.
I don’t know why exactly.	Nayax janiw kunatsa chiqpachapunix uk yatkti.
He last saw her here.	Jupajj qhep qhepa kutiw jupar akan uñjäna.
Every person except one.	Sapa jaqiwa jan ukasti mä sapa jaqiwa.
That's right, he said.	Ukhamawa, sasaw jupajj säna.
But things never felt right.	Ukampis janipuniw kunas askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
Food isn’t like that.	Manq’añax janiw ukhamäkiti.
The day is beautiful.	Uka urux wali sumawa.
And now she doesn’t like him that much.	Ukat jichhax janiw juparux ukham munkiti.
But for some reason it is not.	Ukampis kunatsa janiw ukhamäkiti.
See here and here.	Aka ukat aka uñjañäni.
Anyone, always has.	Khitis, sapa kutiw utji.
It really didn’t matter to him.	Chiqpachansa janiw juparux kuns lurkänti.
And this is very much though.	Ukat akax wali jach’a ukampis.
Good kind of thing.	Suma kasta.
Don't let him do it.	Janiw jupar uk lurañapatak jaytañamäkiti.
Yes, obviously impossible.	Jïsa, qhanaw jan lurañjamäkiti.
And there was none for a long, long time.	Ukat janiw khitis utjkänti jaya, jaya tiempo.
I don’t know who he is.	Janiw khitïnsa uk yatkti.
He’s done something terribly wrong, after all.	Jupax mä jach’a jan wali lurawayi, taqi kunat sipansa.
I am nothing and everything.	Nayax janiw kunas ukat taqi kunas.
Not about going out at night.	Janiw arumax sarxañ tuqitxa.
Let me first say this.	Nayax nayraqat akham sañ munta.
Always this or that.	Sapa kutiw aka jan ukax ukhama.
So the .	Ukhamajj uka .
I don't want him to be.	Janiw nayajj jupar munkti.
No one seemed to know either way.	Janiw khitis uka pä tuqit yatkaspa ukhamäkänti.
There’s obviously money involved.	Ukanx qhanaw qullqix utji.
I give it to everyone.	Nayax taqiniruw churta.
The next day I felt better.	Qhipürux wali sum jikxatasiyäta.
Something terrible but important.	Kunas wali axsarkañ ukampis wali wakiskiriwa.
But it doesn’t do anything like that.	Ukampis janiw kuns ukham lurkiti.
Yes, he decided to move there.	Jïsa, ukaruw sarxañ amtawayi.
You don’t have to eat.	Janiw manq’añax wakiskiti.
I’ve seen a lot.	Nayax wal uñjta.
Thank you to me.	Nayaruw yuspärta.
But it feels like it can be done.	Ukampis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
I don’t see this being used.	Nayax janiw uka apnaqañ uñjkti.
But he knew what had happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna uk sum yatïna.
That was not the problem.	Ukajj janiw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
I don’t want a man.	Nayax janiw mä chachar munkti.
I know it's you.	Nayajj jumaw uk yattwa.
He does it several days.	Jupax walja urunak luraski.

So that feels pretty good.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
I didn't understand why he said that.	Kunatsa ukham siskäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
I said it was wrong.	Nayax jan waliw uk sista.
It was kind of like that for me.	Nayatakejj mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
He will not do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurkaniti.
It does two things.	Ukax pä lurañanak luraski.
I drink coffee for breakfast.	Nayax desayuno lurañatakix café umañ yatta.
Clearly, this was not the first time he had done so.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr kuti ukham lurkänti, ukajj qhanawa.
Today, he was not available.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw jupajj utjkänti.
Of course, it is summer.	Chiqansa, ukax verano satawa.
There is something wrong with the country.	Mä jan waliw uka markan utji.
To be honest, that’s exactly what happened.	Chiqpachansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
But he decided to do it right.	Ukampis sum lurañwa amtäna.
Like I love to talk.	Kunjamtï nayajj parlañ wal munkta ukhama.
I never thought of it that way!.	¡Janipuniw ukham amuyirïkti!.
That’s a very early date.	Ukax wali nayra pacharuw puri.
I wasn't sure what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
Definitely worth the money.	Chiqpachansa, uka qullqix wali askiwa.
I saw that happening.	Nayax ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
He talked about it for years.	Walja maranakaw uka toqet parläna.
He didn't want me here.	Jupajj janiw nayar akan munkänti.
He looks kind of cool.	Jupax mä juk’a thaya uñnaqaniwa.
This can take a long time.	Ukajj walja tiempow pasaspa.
This person doesn’t do that.	Aka jaqix janiw ukham lurkiti.
Well, he doesn’t have any money.	Ukhama, jupax janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
That is not what he should do.	Ukajj janiw kuntï lurañapäkiti.
If you need to do that.	Ukham lurañax wakisispa ukhaxa.
I thought that was what he wanted.	Ukaw jupajj munäna sasaw amuyayäta.
He had to do something and he did.	Jupax kuns lurañaw wakisïna ukat ukhamaw luräna.
I’m worried about him.	Nayax jupat llakitaw jikxatastxa.
He's better now.	Jupax jichhax juk'amp askiwa.
But he refused to do so.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
So, you know, that’s funny.	Ukhama, jumax yatisktawa, ukax wali muspharkañawa.
He worked, for one thing.	Jupax irnaqäna, mä tuqitxa.
He knew exactly who he meant.	Jupajj khitïnsa sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
I wouldn’t buy that in there.	Nayax janiw uka manqhan ukanak alañ munkayätti.
That is not necessary at all.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa wakiskiti.
But that was a while ago.	Ukampis ukajj mä qhawqha tiempo nayraw pasäna.
You’re not worth it.	Jumax janiw kunäkisa.

He died the day before.	Jupajj nayrïr uruw jiwjjäna.
He never did anything on his own.	Janipuniw jupa pachpajj kuns lurkänti.
I don’t know what to make of him really.	Janiw yatkti kunsa jupat chiqpachapuni lurañama.
He says this many times.	Ukxa walja kutiw arsu.
Very expensive.	Sinti qullqi.
He went to bed.	Jupajj ikiñar saräna.
He didn’t know how much.	Jupax janiw qawqha qullqis uk yatkänti.
Well here goes.	Suma akax saraski.
There is no other way to do it.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkaspati.
No, this was a house mouse.	Janiwa, akax mä uta ch’uqi satänwa.
And he wasn't sure what he thought of himself.	Ukat kunsa jupa pachpa amuyäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I want to know how that feels.	Ukajj kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi uk yatiñwa munta.
I knew he would do everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa lurani uk sum yatiyäta.
He’s really excited.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
Clearly this is not the case.	Qhanaw ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But that doesn't mean it's helpless.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan kuns lurañjamäkiti sañ munkiti.
It used to be wonderful.	Nayrajj wali sumapunïnwa.
Something I don't know well.	Kunas jan sum yatkaspa.
Well actually whatever.	Suma chiqpachansa kunas.
It seems to me to be good.	Nayatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
It’s always what you want.	Ukax sapa kutiw kuntix jumax munkta ukhama.
She’s a beautiful, beautiful woman.	Jupax wali suma, suma warmiwa.
But for how long?.	Ukampis ¿qhawqha tiempos?.
I can't say anything.	Janiw kunas uk sum siskti.
¡That was wonderful!	¡Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa!.
There were many hours.	Walja horanakaw utjäna.
So you think it's okay.	Ukhamajj jumajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyasta.
Is there any way to do that.	¿Ukham lurañatakejj kunas utji.
He told her a lot.	Jupajj walpun jupar yatiyäna.
You’re always somewhere.	Jumax sapa kutiw kawkhans jikxatastaxa.
Two things a week can be good.	Semanan pä lurañanak lurañajj wali askïspawa.
And for one thing, it really is.	Ukat mä tuqitxa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
I see him in here.	Nayax juparux aka manqhan uñjta.
This is not available anywhere else.	Ukajj janiw yaqha cheqan utjkiti.
Such a great one car.	Ukhama jach’a mä auto.
It doesn’t matter who, what it is.	Janiw khitis, kunas ukax wakiskiti.
He knew exactly what to do, how much to do.	Jupax kuns lurañapa, qawqha lurañas uk sum yatïna.
He wasn’t there last time.	Jupax janiw qhipa kutix utjkänti.
Actually, he was right.	Chiqpachansa, jupax chiqaw säna.
But he could not speak.	Ukampis jupajj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
It’s one thing at a time, she says.	Mä kunaw mä kutix utji, sasaw jupax saraki.
I understand that’s it.	Nayax amuyasta ukax.
I doubt you do anything.	Nayax pächastwa jumax kuns lurañama.
The journey home was wonderful.	Utar sarañax wali sumapunïnwa.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Jupaw nayamp parltʼañ munta sasaw sitäna.
Can you do this for me.	¿Jumax nayatakix uk lurasmati.
He said he had no intention of doing so.	Janiw ukham lurañ amtkti sasaw säna.
He’s really fun and exciting.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa ukat wali kusiskañawa.
He refused both.	Jupajj panpachaniw jan munkänti.
Serious work is required.	Sinti lurañaw wakisi.
But, however.	Ukampis, ukampis.
Everything will be there.	Taqi kunas utjani.
There is no future.	Jutïr pachax janiw utjkiti.
So I didn't expect that from anyone.	Ukhamajj janiw khitirus ukham suykayätti.
You are right there.	Jumax chiqaw ukan jikxatastaxa.
They are the.	Jupanakax uka...
You know how honest he is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams chiqapar sarnaqäna.
There is nothing else !.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti !.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
Kind of small.	Mä kasta jisk’a.
I don’t know anything about him.	Janiw jupat kuns yatkti.
He knows what is best.	Jupaw kunas wali askïspa uk sum yati.
The book of the day.	Uka uru libro.
He knew what he was doing to me.	Jupajj kuntï nayar lurkäna uk sum yatïna.
But he didn't want that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj uk munkänti.
Somehow, it looks a little bigger.	Kunjamatsa, mä juk’a jach’a uñtatawa.
And this one.	Ukat akax.
I don't know how to do it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
I hope this is just as good!.	Nayax suyt’twa akax ukhamarakiw wali suma!.
There is no way to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkaspati.

That was really, really good.	Ukax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
Like you can do things.	Kunjamtï jumax kunanaktï lurañjamäki ukhama.
It only happened once or twice.	Mä kuti jan ukajj pä kutikiw ukham pasäna.
I really think that’s important.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
You don’t have to drive.	Janiw autot sarañax wakiskiti.
He knows how you feel.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
And what can happen.	Ukat kunas pasaspa.
He didn't know what that was, but he could do it.	Ukajj kunas uk janiw yatkänti, ukampis uk luraspänwa.
That has always been the problem.	Ukajj nayratpachaw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
It’s funny, like you said.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhama.
You stopped taking pictures.	Jumax fotonak apsuñ jaytawayta.

You know, there’s nothing else you can do these days.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw kunas uka urunakanx yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
Just as you would expect.	Kunjamtï jumajj suykayäta ukhama.
I’ll leave it at that.	Nayax ukaruw jaytawayta.
I never wanted to be like that.	Janipuniw ukham tukuñ munkayätti.
He’s doing really well.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sum luraski.
He went there, but quickly returned.	Jupajj ukaruw saräna, ukampis jankʼakiw kuttʼjjäna.
There is nothing you can do at this point.	Aka pachanx janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
Whatever is necessary.	Kunatï wakiski ukajja.
I personally appreciate it.	Naya pachpaw wali askit uñjta.
She was watching him intently.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I came to see for myself.	Naya pachpaw uñjir jutta.
But now it is clear to me.	Ukampis jichhajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasi.
He took out more.	Jupajj jukʼamp apsüna.
It’s a woman.	Mä warmiwa.
And that’s exactly what worked.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw irnaqäna.
That’s good, he thought.	Ukax wali askiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
But you’re a real person.	Ukampis jumax chiqpach jaqïtawa.
But then something happened today.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jichhüruw kunas pasäna.
He’s still waiting.	Jupax wali suyt’aski.
There is no time to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix janiw tiempox utjkiti.
He said no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp siskänti.
Also, he’s two people.	Ukhamaraki, jupax pä jaqiwa.
I want to see the villain.	Nayax uka jan wali jaqir uñjañ munta.
Everything is unnecessary.	Taqi kunas jan wakiskiriwa.
I really don’t know anything about anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna tuqitsa kunsa yatkti.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit arsuñ munkti.
I think this would be interesting.	Nayax amuyta akax wali askïspawa.
So I haven’t seen it.	Ukhamajj janiw uñjkti.
I could have done it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk luraspäna.
I had no idea what was coming next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw amuykayätti.
He’s really a great teacher.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali jach’a yatichiriwa.
And there’s money to be made.	Ukat qullqix lurañatakiw utji.
Everything but red.	Taqi kunas jan ukax wila.
It’s almost too weird.	Niya wali muspharkañawa.
Strange, he thought, how he knew how to do it.	Muspharkañawa, kunjamsa jupax uk lurañ yatïna, sasaw amuyäna.
How long will it last? 	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani?
But you know, he’s a good guy.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
You don’t have to do that yet.	Janiw jichhakamax ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Maybe that’s the point.	Inas ukax uka tuqitxa.
Very impressive, in fact.	Wali muspharkañawa, chiqansa.
There was no way he was going to drive it.	Janiw kunjamatsa uka auto apnaqañapatak utjkänti.
But you have to work at it.	Ukampis ukaruw chʼamachasiñama.
I see it so well.	Ukham sum uñjta.
I like everything about it.	Nayatakix taqi kunas uka tuqitx wali askiwa.
And it seems to make good financial sense.	Ukat qullqi tuqitxa wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
Let’s see what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta uk uñjañäni.
It was an adult.	Ukajj mä jilïr jaqënwa.
Maybe I think it is.	Inas nayax amuyta.
He wants something more.	Jupajj jukʼamp kunsa muni.
Not bad really.	Janiw jan walïkiti chiqpachansa.
I don’t know.	Janiw yatkiti.
From here or there.	Aka chiqat jan ukax uka tuqit.
Why, of course he knew how.	Kunatsa, chiqansa jupax kunjamsa uk lurañ yatïna.
He loved to talk about himself.	Jupa pachpat parlañ wal munäna.
Don’t leave one alone.	Janiw mä sapak jaytañamäkiti.
It is obvious however.	Ukajj qhanaw ukampis.
I don’t really know how to do it.	Nayax janiw chiqpachans kunjams lurañ yatkti.
He hadn’t liked it in the first place.	Nayratpach janiw jupar gustkänti.
That never happened to me.	Ukajj janipuniw nayatakejj utjkänti.
Perhaps the	Inas uka .
No one can really do anything.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kuns lurkaspati.
There was no one there.	Ukanjja, janiw khitis utjkänti.
I want to know the details.	Nayax uka tuqit sum yatxatañ munta.
That’s what happened this week.	Ukaw aka semanan pasäna.

Perhaps you feel that way.	Inas jumajj ukham amuyasta.
That's not too bad.	Ukajj janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
But boy is it fun.	Ukampis waynax kusiskañawa.
A week later he called again.	Mä semana qhepatjja, wasitatwa jawsäna.
You can and should do better.	Jumax juk’amp sum lurasma ukat lurañamawa.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, walikïskiwa.
He was practically helpless.	Jupajj niyaw jan kuns lurañ puedkänti.
Except for a cold day.	Jan ukasti thaya uru.
They like it a lot, you don't.	Jupanakajj wal gusti, janiw jumajj gustkiti.
I want a car.	Nayax mä auto munta.
I had no problem of any kind.	Janiw kuna kasta jan waltʼäwis utjkitänti.
I’ve seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham uñjta.
That, he said.	Ukax, sasaw säna.
So he doesn't know what he wants.	Ukhamajj janiw kuntï munki uk yatkiti.
He found himself coming out more and more.	Jupajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw mistuñ jikjjatasïna.
He was almost dead.	Jupajj niyaw jiwjjäna.
Just like yours does.	Kunjamtï jumanakan lurapkta ukhama.
The same two.	Pachpa pä.
I thought it was something.	Kunas ukhamänwa sasaw amuyayäta.
Please let me know if that works.	Ukax walikïskiti janicha uk yatiyapxita.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurañ puedkänti.
She looked lovely.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uñnaqäna.
There was no one to do it.	Janiw khitis uk lurañapatak utjkänti.
And tell him exactly what to do.	Ukat kunsa lurañapa uk sum yatiyañama.
He knew he would.	Jupajj ukham lurani uk sum yatïna.
I don't understand what he was saying.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk janiw amuykti.
The first day went really well.	Nayrïr urux chiqpachapuniw wali sum saräna.
It was really obvious.	Chiqpachansa qhanaw amuyasïna.
Or try to do that.	Jan ukajj ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
But it is better today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa jukʼamp sumawa.
He seemed eager to help her.	Jupajj jupar yanaptʼañ wal munkaspa ukhamänwa.
No one knew the language.	Janiw khitis uka aru yatkänti.
I am so grateful for that now.	Jichhajj ukat walpun yuspärta.
He wanted to go home.	Jupajj utar sarañ munäna.
And that’s what’s happening.	Ukat ukax kunas pasaski.
But it was a long time.	Ukampis wali jaya tiempow pasäna.
So good, well, thank you very much.	Ukhama suma, wali, walpun yuspärta.
He left a year ago.	Jupajj mä mara nayraw sarjjäna.
I wasn't sure what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
Do it in this world.	Aka pachan lurañamawa.
I want him in on this.	Nayax juparux aka tuqit mantañ munta.
I don’t even do that.	Nayax janiw ni ukham lurkti.
I don’t know where it will lead.	Janiw kawkirus purini uk yatkti.
I didn't know anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns yatkayätti.
I don’t know who likes me.	Janiw khitis nayar gustkituti uk yatkti.
The water of life.	Jakañ uma.
But you know that .	Ukampis jumax uk yatisktawa .
I never said never.	Janipuniw janipuniw siskti.
The point is obvious.	Uka tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasi.
I thought he handled himself well.	Jupa pachpaw sum apnaqi sasaw amuyayäta.
It’s a tiny little thing that happens.	Mä jisk’a jisk’a kunatix luraski.
For one thing, it’s long.	Mä tuqitxa, jaya pachaw utji.
That, in my opinion, is better.	Ukax, nayatakix, juk’amp askiwa.
I wonder why it exists.	Kunatsa ukham utji sasaw jisktʼasta.
I think that’s okay, too.	Nayax amuyta ukax walikïskiwa, ukhamaraki.
But these people.	Ukampis uka jaqenakajj.
I’m a very nice guy.	Nayax wali suma jaqïtwa.
He was clearly in trouble.	Jupax qhanaw jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
Two weeks of that.	Pä semanaw uka tuqitxa.
You, you want to see everyone.	Jumax, jumax taqiniruw uñjañ munta.
Of course, this is not a problem.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Same language, of course.	Pachpa aru, chiqpachansa.
It’s been around for years.	Ukax walja maranakaw utji.
She asked him what had happened.	Ukat kunas pasäna sasaw jisktʼäna.
And that’s just it, you know.	Ukat ukakiw ukax, jumax yatisktawa.

It’s a snowflake.	Ukax mä ch’uqi satawa.
He thought he had to do that.	Jupax ukham lurañapawa sasaw amuyäna.
He seems to be a different person.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
I wasn't sure what time it was.	Kuna horasas uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
No one wanted to take it.	Janiw khitis ukanak apsuñ munkänti.
I am not sure how or why.	Kunjamsa jan ukajj kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkti.
That dinner with you.	Uka manq’añax jumamp chika.
I like that about him.	Jupat ukham lurañajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
And again every two weeks.	Ukat sapa pä semanaw wasitat.
But that’s certainly not the case right now.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
That’s how I want to live for myself.	Nayatakix ukham sarnaqañ munta.
He can do whatever he wants.	Kuntï munki uk luraspawa.
Of course, you need to do that ten.	Chiqansa, uka tunka lurañaw wakisi.
There’s tremendous energy.	Ukanx jach’a ch’amaw utji.
He wanted the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk munäna.
It was not premature.	Janiw janïr tiempojj utjkänti.
You can’t have one that big in here.	Janiw mä ukham jach’a jaqix aka manqhan utjkaspati.
He didn't refuse to.	Jupajj janiw jan munkänti.
He was a wonderful, happy man.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, wali kusisit jaqënwa.
This moment was a familiar thing.	Aka pachax mä uñt’at kunaw utjäna.
So he didn't say anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns siskänti.
Of course, there is no problem with the wind.	Chiqansa, thaya tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He said he didn’t know.	Janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
You that morning.	Jumax uka alwax.
He was staring into her eyes.	Jupajj nayranakap uñchʼukiskäna.
He went right to the point.	Jupajj cheqapuniw saräna.
But he did both.	Ukampis jupajj uka pä toqetwa luräna.
The ten coins.	Uka tunka qullqi.
But it would be nice if someone else could do it.	Ukampis yaqha jaqejj uk luraspa ukhajja, wali askïspawa.
Two facts, yes, yes.	Pä chiqa, jïsa, jïsa.
I’m not sure you can do that.	Nayax janiw yatkti jumax ukham lurasmati.
He told it to himself.	Jupajj jupa pachpaw uk yatiyäna.
The night was a little better.	Uka arumax mä juk’a juk’amp sumaw jikxatasïna.
Therefore there are two things.	Ukatwa pä kunas utji.

Who told him, he knew where.	Khitis jupar yatiyäna, kawkhans uk yatïna.
I would love to know.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw yatiñ munta.

I haven’t decided yet.	Nayax janiw jichhakamax amtkti.
They have everything.	Jupanakajj taqe kunaw utji.
I don't know what's going on with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas pasaski uk yatkti.
It wants to eat.	Ukax manq’añ muni.
It was really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
So yeah, absolutely.	Ukhamajj jïsa, cheqapuniw.
I agree with you on this.	Nayax jumamp chikaw aka tuqitxa.
He said it was amazing.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa sasaw säna.
It needs you.	Ukajj jumaruw munasi.
It actually takes a year.	Chiqansa mä maraw munasispa.
He doesn't know what could happen.	Ukajj kunas pasaspa uk janiw yatkiti.
I don’t know what the outcome will be.	Uka tuqitxa kunas utjani uk janiw yatkti.
No one knows better than you.	Janiw khitis jumat sipan jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
Now I am doing it all on my own.	Jichhajj taqe ukanak sapakiw luraskta.
I thought maybe he should go to the police.	Nayax inas jupax policiaruw sarañapa sasaw amuyayäta.
Or the airplane.	Jan ukax avión.
I want to buy that.	Nayax uka alañ munta.
But no one mentioned you once.	Ukampis janiw khitis mä kutis jumat arskänti.
I have one like that.	Nayax ukham mayniw utjitu.
I’m sure he can do well.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali sum luraspa.
I don't know exactly what happened to that.	Ukajj kunas pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurawayi.
He was a man of few words.	Jupajj jukʼa arunak parlir jaqënwa.
You’re agreed.	Jumax iyaw satawa.
Do what is right.	Kunatï cheqäki uk luram.
If only he had one.	Jupajj mä jukʼa utjaspa ukhajja.
I’m starting to smile.	Nayax qalltawayta.
Actually, I’m pretty good.	Chiqansa, nayax wali suma jaqïtwa.
He always knows it.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk yati.
He has no idea where he’s walking.	Jupax janiw kawkhans sarnaqaski uk amuykiti.
But the truth shocked him.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj walpun muspharäna.
Time needs space.	Tiempox mä chiqaw munasispa.
But I can't figure out how.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
It was immediately shaken up.	Ukajj jankʼakiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
He refused to help with it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yanaptʼañ munkänti.
This is not a bad thing in any way.	Ukax janiw kuna tuqitsa jan walïkiti.
I don’t know where it’s going.	Janiw kawkirus saraski uk yatkti.
I feel that this is wrong.	Ukax jan waliw sasaw amuyasta.
So it takes time.	Ukhamajj tiempow munasispa.
He really knew how to do things.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamsa kunsa lurañ yatïna uk sum yatïna.
All of these are irrelevant.	Taqi ukanakax janiw kunäkisa.
You look small.	Jumax jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
You can pretty much do it all.	Jumax niyaw taqi ukanak lurasma.
I didn't know what he was saying but it was obvious what he was saying.	Janiw kuntï siskäna uk yatkayätti ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
In fact, he did a lot of it.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa walpun luräna.
He could do it, he thought.	Jupaw uk luraspäna, sasaw amuyasïna.
And that would be a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askïspawa.
It really isn’t .	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti .
He didn’t know himself that well.	Jupax janiw jupa pachpat ukham sum yatkänti.
I want to be myself.	Naya pachpaw sarnaqañ munta.
But that alone is not enough.	Ukampis uka sapakix janiw walïkiti.
He doesn't want to move too fast.	Jupajj janiw sinti jankʼak sarnaqañ munkiti.
Not long gone now.	Janiw jaya pachax jichhax sarkiti.
Something meant that.	Kunas ukham sañ munäna.
And I never thought of anyone before him.	Ukat jupat nayrajj janipuniw khitirus ukham amuyirïkti.
That’s still our biggest.	Ukax wali jiwasan jach’a.
No, that is not possible.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He really uses it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw apnaqi.
And still too hot.	Ukat wali sinti junt’u.
I agree with him.	Nayajj jupamp iyaw sasaw ukham sista.
And that’s not the best thing to do.	Ukat janiw ukax wali askïkiti.
No one knew his name.	Janiw khitis sutip yatkänti.
In fact, he came very often.	Chiqansa, jupax wali walja kutiw jutäna.
And they don’t know that.	Ukat janiw uk yatipkiti.
It’s also pretty great.	Ukhamaraki wali jach’a.
He said the money was bad.	Jupax qullqix jan waliw sasaw säna.
I want to go alone.	Nayax sapakiw sarañ munta.
What you were expecting.	Kunsa jumajj suykayäta.
But for a long time no one knew.	Ukampis walja tiempojj janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
You can definitely do it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw uk lurasma.
That was what he was afraid of.	Ukaw jupajj ajjsaräna.
He didn't want to eat anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns manqʼañ munkänti.

They have a place here.	Jupanakax aka chiqanx mä chiqaw utji.

The young man is still beautiful.	Waynax wali sumawa.
He does the work.	Jupaw uka lurañanak luri.
He’s a stranger again.	Jupax wasitat jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
He took a lot out of everyone.	Taqiniruw walja apsüna.
I'm very happy with one.	Nayax wali kusisitaw mä.

But I’m still worried.	Ukampis nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa.

Just what you can do about it.	Kuntï uka toqet lurañjamäki ukakiw.
Maybe he wanted to take care of me.	Inas jupajj nayar sum uñjañ munpachäna.
Each of these is not good enough.	Ukanakat sapa mayniw jan askïkiti.
He didn't want to give anything away.	Jupajj janiw kuns churañ munkänti.
He sat on her with great pleasure.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jupar qontʼasïna.
And he has to do something.	Ukat jupax kuns lurañapawa.
And really, he didn't want one.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
But it didn't exist at the time.	Ukampis janiw uka tiempon utjkänti.
Which, of course, he was.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa.
He didn't say anything, but he didn't deny it.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti, ukampis janiw uk arskänti.
He made the dish himself.	Jupa pachpaw uka manqʼa luratayna.
He said he didn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham gustkituti sasaw säna.
I realize that is happening to me.	Nayarojj ukham pasaski uk amuyasta.
That's the thing.	Ukaw ukajja.
This is the case.	Aka kasta.
I don’t really need them.	Janiw chiqpachapunix jupanakar munaskiti.
You came with him.	Jumax jupamp chikaw jutta.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Ukampis, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He now knew why.	Kunatsa uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
And that day.	Ukat uka uru.
He is a truly remarkable man.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
I really want the job.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uka irnaqäw munta.
Or, it used to be.	Jan ukajj, nayrajj ukhamänwa.
You think so, but you don’t.	Jumax ukham amuyta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He does not know why he feels that way.	Kunatsa ukham amuyi uk janiw yatkiti.
Twice a day.	Urun pä kuti.
I know you know that.	Nayax yattwa jumax uk yatisktawa.
It’s going pretty well.	Ukax wali sum saraski.
¿What's the matter? 	¿Kunas utji?
And it looks like our big day is tomorrow.	Ukat jiwasan jach’a urux qharüruw purini sasaw uñt’asi.
Lunch would be good.	Chika uru manq’añax wali askïspawa.
Three great years, that’s what I mean.	Kimsa jach’a mara, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
These are not bad things.	Ukanakax janiw jan walïkiti.
I don’t think it was.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyta.
There’s very little for me.	Nayatakix wali juk’akiw utji.
It takes too much heart.	Ukatakejj sinti chuymaw munasispa.
He never noticed.	Jupajj janipuniw amuyaskänti.
So he sat down.	Ukatwa jupajj qontʼasïna.
Someone was in this room with him.	Maynix jupamp chikaw aka cuarto ukan jikxatasïna.
I’m not really sure how to go about this.	Nayax janiw chiqpachans kunjams aka tuqit sarañax ukx yatkti.
Tomorrow will be the last day.	Qhipürux qhipa uruw utjani.
I put it aside.	Nayax mä chiqar jaytawayta.
I know he does that.	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraski.
But that is not the case today.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to see them.	Nayax jupanakar uñjañ munta.
No, I am awesome.	Janiwa, nayajj wali muspharkañawa.
Two days ago.	Pä uru nayra.
Tell me what it says.	Kuntï siski uk yatiyapjjeta.
And going from here to there is what we do.	Ukat aka chiqat uka chiqar sarañax kuntix lurapkta ukawa.
He could not stay outside.	Jupajj janiw anqan qheparañ puedkänti.
And why.	Ukat kunatsa.
In fact, it needs to be done faster, faster.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp jankʼakiw lurañapa, jukʼamp jankʼakiw lurañapa.
Don’t do that to him.	Janiw jupar ukham luramti.
Where do you want to go first?.	¿Kawkirus nayraqat sarañ munta?.
I have something here, he says.	Nayax mä kuns akan utjitu, jupax siwa.
It’s nice to do it there again.	Ukan wasitat lurañax wali askiwa.
Somehow it felt the same way.	Kunjamatsa ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasïna.
I didn’t get a thing.	Nayax janiw mä kuns jikxatkti.
I feel really good this morning.	Chiqpachansa jichha alwax wali sum jikxatastxa.
I think that is a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
Is he okay with it.	¿Jupajj walikïskiti.
But it still doesn't work.	Ukampis waliw jan irnaqkiti.
This is hot and humid.	Akax junt’u, thaya utji.
And very, very quickly.	Ukat wali, wali jank’akiw.
Too bad there aren’t more like him.	Sinti jan waliw janiw jupar uñtasit juk’amp utjkiti.
They don’t have the money.	Jupanakax janiw qullqix utjkiti.
The man is still a man.	Jaqix wali jaqiwa.
Well, we’re better off.	Ukhama, jiwasax juk’amp askiwa.
I want some water.	Nayax mä juk’a uma munta.
Couldn't agree more.	Janiw jukʼamp iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It was, but it didn't.	Ukajj ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti.
He wasn't sure where he learned the language.	Jupajj kawkhansa uka aru yateqäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
So, this is a surprise.	Ukhama, akax mä muspharkañawa.
All day, you just feel like it.	Taqi uru, jumax ukhamakiw jikxatasïta.
In a way he loves it.	Mä kasta tuqitxa jupax walpun munasi.
Everyone knows what is going on.	Taqinipuniw kunas pasaski uk yatipxi.
That’s what happened that night.	Ukhamaw uka arumax pasäna.
He’d felt this way before, many times, over the years.	Jupax nayrax ukham jikxatasïna, walja kutiw, walja maranakaw ukham jikxatasïna.
No one could do it better than you.	Janiw khitis jumat sipansa jukʼamp lurkaspänti.
I'm coming together well.	Sumaw jutani.
A little too much.	Mä juk’a sinti jach’a.
Another thing I like.	Yaqha tuqitxa nayatakix wali askiwa.
The night was better.	Arumax juk’amp sumapunïnwa.
This doesn’t work anymore.	Akax janiw juk’amp irnaqkiti.
I understood it perfectly.	Nayajj sumwa amuyayäta.
No one knows at the moment.	Janiw khitis jichha pachanx yatkiti.
But I don't know exactly where he is now.	Ukampis jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
I see our breakfast.	Nayax jiwasan desayuno uñjta.
What do you think will happen?.	¿Kunas pasani sasin amuyta?.
It was obvious to me that he did not.	Janiw ukham lurkänti, ukajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I didn’t really know that.	Janiw cheqpachapun uk yatkayätti.
He sat there for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow ukan qontʼasïna.
There is no reason to do so.	Ukham lurañatakix janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
I don’t want to take it out on you.	Janiw jumanakar apsuñ munkti.
So we have to .	Ukhamajj jiwasajj .
He did that today.	Jichhüruw ukham luräna.
I am not sure at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa sum yatkti.
I love the word.	Nayax uka aru walpun munasta.
Very nice heart, though.	Wali suma chuyma, ukampis.
I wasn’t entirely surprised.	Nayax janiw taqpach muspharkayätti.
Or something else.	Jan ukajj yaqha ukhama.
And better about himself, too.	Ukat jupa pachpat juk’amp suma, ukhamaraki.
He’s available immediately.	Jupax jank’akiw utji.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Jupax janiw kuns luraski uk yatkiti.
He didn't tell anyone he was waiting.	Janiw khitirus suytʼaskta siskänti.
I think maybe around ten.	Nayax inas niya tunka jak’an amuyta.
I finally saw it myself.	Naya pachpaw qhipharux uñjta.
I'm so whatever.	Nayax ukhama kunas.
I want to see what happens.	Kunas pasani uk uñjañ wal munta.
I don’t know why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa.
The next day the snowflakes.	Qhipürux uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
And now it feels good.	Ukat jichhax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
About entering the house.	Utar mantañ tuqitxa.
I know what it is.	Nayax yattwa kunas uk.
I’m hoping for that.	Nayax ukham suyt’askta.
But that’s how it started.	Ukampis ukhamwa qalltäna.
It didn't seem possible.	Janiw ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
You might do worse.	Inas jukʼamp jan walinak lurasma.
Of course, we weren’t.	Chiqansa, janiw jiwasax ukhamäkänti.
It was wonderful for you.	Jumatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.
He knows when it is necessary.	Kunapachas wakisispa uk jupaw sum yati.
In fact, I love it.	Chiqansa, nayax walpun munasta.
Here’s how to do it.	Akax kunjams lurañax uk uñjañäni.
But I still think it was a good film.	Ukampis nayax wali amuyta, mä suma película ukhamänwa.
So it’s okay .	Ukhamajj walikïskiwa .
I have a hunger for it.	Nayax ukatakix mä manq’at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
So he needs to make some room in his house.	Ukhamajj utapan mä jukʼa cuarto lurañapawa.
He wanted to talk to her.	Jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.
You’re good though, you know.	Jumax wali sumawa ukampis, jumax yatisktawa.
No, there really wasn’t.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiw utjkänti.
I don't understand it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw uk amuykti.
It’s a great day.	Mä jach’a uru.
You may want more or less.	Inas jumax jukʼamp jan ukax jukʼamp munsta.
And other people him.	Ukat yaqha jaqinakax juparux.
But he refused to get involved.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukar mantañ munkänti.
He’s a lot better now.	Jupax jichhax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He loved it here.	Jupax akanx walpun munasïna.
He could not go now.	Jichhajj janiw sarañ puedkänti.
I’ve been with you.	Nayax jumamp chikaw jikxatasiyäta.
But he seemed to be a nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He did much better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
Therefore, no question was needed.	Ukatwa, janiw mä jisktʼajj wakiskänti.
They don’t quite know yet.	Jupanakax janiw jichhakamax sum yatipkiti.
They need to do that.	Jupanakax ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He understood why this might happen.	Kunatsa ukham pasaspa uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
He gladly agreed.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw iyaw säna.
I don’t think he does.	Nayax janiw jupax ukham lurkiti sasaw amuyta.
He did it again, and.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luräna, ukat.
Tonight, if you will.	Jichha arumax, jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
That could be the future.	Ukaw jutïrin utjaspa.
But it was perfect for that.	Ukampis ukatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
Or so he thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyasïna.
Only one got it.	Mä sapakiw uk katoqäna.
It was something he had done before.	Ukajj nayrajj lurkäna ukhamänwa.
Week after week.	Semana ukat semana.
I want to be careful.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw sarnaqañ munta.
But he didn't realize it.	Ukampis janiw uk amuyaskänti.
We’ll make one.	Jiwasax mä lurañäni.
That took two weeks.	Ukatakejj pä semanaw pasäna.
He wondered what that could be.	Kunas ukajj utjaspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But there is too much time.	Ukampis sinti tiempow utji.
To me this means a lot of things.	Nayatakix akax walja yänak sañ muni.
He started talking to himself.	Jupa pachpaw parlañ qalltäna.
No, there is nothing to do.	Janiwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
So that makes sense for that.	Ukhamajj ukajj ukatakejj walikïskiwa.
That means a few words.	Ukax mä qawqha arunak sañ muni.
It’s really not like that why.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti kunatsa.
So after all.	Ukhamajj taqe kunat sipansa.
And when it goes, it goes well.	Ukat kunapachatï ukax sarxi ukhax wali sum saraski.
This time it’s okay.	Jichha kutix walikïskiwa.
I want to come anyway.	Nayax kunjamatsa jutañ munta.
He’s the one who takes care of it.	Jupaw uk uñji.
One is a bit unusual.	Maynix mä juk’a jan uñt’atawa.
He likes me a lot.	Jupajj nayaruw wal gustitu.
I know the facts.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk yattwa.
And he knew it.	Ukat jupax uk yatïna.
I don’t quite get this.	Nayax janiw taqpach akax jikxatkti.
He doesn’t understand what he’s saying.	Jupax janiw kuntï siskäna uk amuykiti.
It would be impossible for me to go there.	Ukar sarañajj janiw nayatakejj utjkaspati.
True.	Ch'iqa.
Good big heart.	Suma jach’a chuyma.
I still don't understand that.	Nayajj jichhakamajj janiw uk amuykti.
Looking forward to speaking with you.	Jumampi parltʼañ suytʼaskta.
I didn't know what to do there.	Ukan kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.
Like it happens every day.	Kunjamtï sapa urux ukham luraski ukhama.
It feels pretty obvious to me.	Nayatakix wali qhanaw jikxatasi.
He went somewhere else.	Jupajj yaqha cheqar saräna.
Let's see what he thinks about it.	Ukanakat kunsa jupajj amuyi uk uñjañäni.
I have my own.	Nayajj naya pachpaw utjitu.
You want him to be.	Jumaw jupar munta.
An unusual time on a great night.	Mä jan uñt’at pachax mä jach’a arumax.

The three of them.	Uka kimsa.
I’ve seen a little bit of it.	Nayax mä juk’a uñjta.
And, when .	Ukat, kunapachatï .
He left when he decided.	Kunapachatï amtkäna ukhaw sarjjäna.
But it happened faster.	Ukampis jukʼamp jankʼakiw pasäna.
That’s the power out there.	Ukax ch’amaw ukanx utji.
But you can still do it.	Ukampis jumajj wali sumwa lurasma.
Things are still good.	Kunanakas wali askiwa.
He had just realized something.	Jupajj jichhakiw kuns amuyäna.
He didn't quite understand what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw sum amuykänti.
Three three.	Kimsa kimsa.
I can't say exactly when.	Kunapachas uk janiw sum siskti.
That doesn’t work right now.	Ukax janiw jichhax irnaqkiti.
You know this as well as anyone.	Jumax uk sum yatisktawa, kunjamtï khitis yatkta ukhama.
Maybe this evening.	Inas jichha jayp’ux.
He seemed stupid.	Jupax llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I haven’t been able to do it yet.	Jichhakamax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I thought that was a beautiful thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.
I decided to give it another chance and do something.	Nayax yaqha ch’am churañ amtawayta ukat kuns lurañ amtawayta.
It started a good thing.	Ukax mä suma lurañ qalltäna.
How beautiful he is.	Kunjamsa jupajj wali suma.
In fact, it seems unlikely.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurkaspati sasaw amuyasi.
But there was nothing for it.	Ukampis janiw ukatakejj kunas utjkänti.
Not for very long either.	Janiw sinti jaya tiempos ukhamäkiti.
There’s a lot of beauty there.	Ukanx wali sumaw utji.
Whatever it is.	Kunas kunas ukax.
There are many things.	Walja kunaw utji.
He sat down with great satisfaction.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw qontʼasïna.
I don't know how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk janiw yatkti.
So he moved away.	Ukatwa jupajj yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.
He just stared at it for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj ukhamakiw uñchʼukiskäna.
People that great.	Jaqinakax uka jach’a.
And that evil is now imminent.	Ukat uka jan wali lurañajj jichhajj niyaw purini.
They’re good about it.	Jupanakax uka tuqitx wali askiwa.
What do you want from me?.	¿Kunsa nayat munta?.
That was the case .	Ukajj ukhamänwa .
I guess we’ll see how it goes.	Nayax amuyta kunjams saraski uk uñjañäni.
There’s nothing there for you.	Janiw kunas jumatakix ukan utjkiti.
Something is just not right.	Kunas ukhamakiw jan walïkiti.
Just try your best.	Ukhamajj taqe chʼamampiw chʼamachasiñama.
Everything slows down quickly.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw juk’ampi juk’ampi.
But now he looks much more mature.	Ukampis jichhajj jukʼamp jilïr uñnaqaniwa.
Making food is fun.	Manq’a lurañax wali kusiskañawa.
And he loved it so much.	Ukat walpun munasïna.
That would take time, but it was not immediately obvious.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasispa, ukampis janiw jankʼak amuyaskänti.
He looks awesome.	Jupax wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
It doesn’t and you know it doesn’t exist.	Janiw ukhamäkiti ukat jumax yatisktawa ukax janiw utjkiti.
That worked for a while.	Ukajj mä qhawqha tiempow irnaqäna.
A little bit more actually.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi chiqpachansa.
But he didn't say that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham siskänti.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, but.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti, ukampis...
They are called snowflakes.	Jupanakax ch’uqi ch’uqi satawa.
I want to give it up.	Nayax uka jaytañ munta.
I believe that’s a yes.	Nayax ukax mä jïsa sasaw amuyasta.
There’s a tremendous amount of energy.	Ukanx mä jach’a ch’amaw utji.

Anyway, this happened.	Kawkhansa, akax pasäna.
This time tomorrow is nothing at all.	Jichha kutin qharürojj janiw kunas kunäkisa.
You know that about me.	Jumax nayat uk yatisktawa.
There was no one, for that matter.	Janiw khitis utjkänti, ukatakix.

It was like, like that.	Ukhamänwa, ukhama.
What am I doing wrong? 	¿Kunsa nayajj jan wal luraskta?
There was no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkänti.
You look amazing!.	¡Jumax muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa!.
This is becoming more common.	Ukajj jukʼampiw uñjasi.
What you have done elsewhere does not matter.	Kuntï yaqha cheqan lurawaykta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.

That is what happened to me.	Ukaw nayampejj pasäna.
Nice and spacious without being overwhelming.	Suma ukat jach’a jan sinti jach’a.
Tonight, if you will.	Jichha arumax, jumax munsta ukhaxa.

He could do it for hours.	Jupajj walja horanakaw uk luraspäna.
He didn't understand it.	Jupajj janiw sum amuykänti.
It was there almost all day.	Niya taqpach uruw ukan utjäna.
I had nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkitänti.
So let’s see how it works.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
There is no going home for me.	Nayatakix janiw utar sarañax utjkiti.
I really wish this didn’t happen.	Chiqpachansa, akax jan lurasiñap munta.
We will do it yourself.	Jiwasajj juma pachpaw lurañäni.
It would be better if they had a.	Ukax juk’amp askïspawa kunatix jupanakax mä...
No one can do it any other way.	Janiw khitis yaqha tuqit lurkaspati.
I have both of them.	Nayax panpachaniw utjitu.

They are a.	Jupanakax mä.
This is really exciting.	Chiqpachansa akax wali kusiskañawa.
And he’s worried.	Ukat jupax llakitaw jikxatasi.
The box is very nice.	Ukaxa wali sumawa uñjasi.
It had to be done.	Uka lurañaw wakisïna.
The school is very busy.	Yatiqañ utax wali ch’amawa.
Almost never really.	Niya janipuniw chiqpachansa.
It’s still hard, but he’s still moving.	Wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna, ukampis jupax wali ch’amampiw sarnaqäna.

Everything is fine, except for one day.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa, mä urux janiw ukhamäkiti.
And then you don’t matter to me.	Ukat ukat jumax janiw nayatakix kunäkisa.
That was another big one.	Ukajj yaqha jachʼa jaqënwa.
But there is more to man.	Ukampis jaqejj jukʼampiw utji.
And so, you have to do something.	Ukat ukhama, kuns lurañaw wakisi.
She soon learned otherwise.	Ukat jankʼakiw yaqha tuqit yatïna.
It takes some time for anyone.	Khitirus mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
There’s nothing more for you than that.	Janiw kunas jumatakix ukat sipan juk’amp utjkiti.
I already know how to do it.	Nayax niyaw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatta.
That, so far, looks right.	Ukax, jichhakamax, chiqapar uñtatawa.
And really, it doesn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He picked up the phone.	Jupajj uka telefonot apsüna.
I immediately understood what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk jankʼakiw amuyayäta.
There’s nothing long there.	Ukanx janiw kunas jaya pachax utjkiti.
I wonder what to do.	Kunsa lurañama sasaw jisktʼasta.
They’re all either too bloody good or too bloody long.	Taqi jupanakax wali wila suma jan ukax wali wila jaya.
It doesn't matter what he says.	Kuntï siski ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
I thought that was all that was needed.	Ukakiw wakisispa sasaw amuyayäta.

No one understood it better than he did.	Janiw khitis jupat sipansa jukʼamp sum amuykänti.

You have all day.	Jumax taqi uruw utji.
I told him he didn’t know what else to do.	Nayax juparux janiw kuns yaqha lurañax yatkänti sasaw sista.

He’s coming.	Jupaw jutani.
Well, actually .	Ukhama, chiqpachansa .
We need to do something about it.	Uka toqet kuns lurañasa.
But he’s a human being.	Ukampis jupax jaqiwa.
And that's the power.	Ukat ukax ch'amawa.
I had so much fun doing this.	Nayax aka lurañax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Or every three.	Jan ukax sapa kimsa.
He was such a great guy.	Jupajj ukham jachʼa jaqënwa.
I made myself a drink.	Naya pachpaw mä umañ lurayäta.
But not everything is bad.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas jan walïkiti.
I saw everything there.	Ukanjja taqe kunwa uñjta.
This was especially true.	Ukajj jukʼampiw ukhamänwa.
Rain can do that.	Jallux uk luraspawa.
That’s all it takes for me.	Ukaw taqe kun churitu.
He told them so.	Jupaw jupanakar ukham säna.
I really want to take the room.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uka cuarto apsuñ munta.
It didn’t feel all right to me.	Nayatakix janiw taqpach askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
He loved sleeping with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chika ikiñ wal munäna.
I don't know that.	Janiw nayax uk uñt'kti.
He wanted to tell her everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupar yatiyañ munäna.
He just told me what he wanted to do.	Jupajj kuntï lurañ munkäna ukakiw sitäna.
But he was very reluctant.	Ukampis jupajj walpun jan munkänti.
More than one thing.	Mä kunat sipansa.
But somehow, it doesn’t.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I haven’t seen anything else.	Janiw yaqha uñjkti.
Never, ever again.	Janipuniw, janipuniw mayampsa.
It’s more beautiful.	Juk’amp suma.
The process took a week.	Uka lurañajj mä semanaw munasïna.
Everything happened so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jankʼakiw utjäna.
And it was, cool.	Ukat ukhamänwa, wali thaya.
I know that’s not the case for you.	Nayax yattwa janiw ukax jumatakix ukhamäkiti.
I think you feel that way.	Nayax amuyta jumax ukham jikxatastaxa.
Well in this case.	Suma aka tuqitxa.
But we are nothing.	Ukampis jiwasajj janiw kunäkisa.
That is clearly the case here.	Ukajj qhanaw aka cheqan utji.
I don’t know how to use it.	Janiw kunjams apnaqañ yatkti.
There was nothing else to do.	Janiw yaqha lurañax utjkänti.
This is very rare.	Ukajj wali jukʼakiw utji.
You people are amazing though.	Jumanakax jaqinakax muspharkañ ukampis.
Today, however, this is difficult.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, ukajj chʼamakiwa.
There are things you can do before that.	Kunanaktï uka nayrajj lurasma ukanakaw utji.
He thought he would never go to bed.	Janipuniw ikiñar sarkäti sasaw amuyäna.
He returned to the country two years ago.	Pä mara nayraw uka markar kuttʼjjäna.
No, he didn’t do that.	Janiwa, janiw uk lurkänti.
And that wasn’t exactly a good day.	Ukat ukax janiw chiqpachapuni mä suma urux utjkänti.
Which, of course, is not the case.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
What happens to someone.	Kunas khitirus pasaspa.
He said he didn’t go to bed.	Jupax janiw ikiñar sarkti sasaw säna.
This can happen several times a night.	Ukax arumax walja kutiw utjaspa.
She reported the incident to police hours later.	Ukat walja horanak qhepatwa policiaruw uka jan waltʼäwit yatiyäna.
Then he went home.	Ukat utaparuw sarxäna.
It doesn’t happen to me.	Janiw nayat lurkiti.
I didn't understand what he was saying.	Kuntï jupajj siskäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
He’s just going for it.	Jupax ukatakix ukhamakiw saraski.
But obviously he wondered.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj jisktʼasïna.
After some time.	Mä qhawqha tiempo qhepatjja.
You were never like that.	Jumax janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
The location does not matter.	Kawkhantï utjki ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He didn't know what was going on.	Jupajj janiw kunas paskäna uk yatkänti.
He said he didn't know.	Jupajj janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
He expresses how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk arsu.
It will be a whole new world.	Ukajj mä machaq pachaw utjani.
He got the big one.	Jupaw jachʼa katoqäna.
A letter about anything, really.	Mä carta kuna tuqitsa, chiqpachansa.
This is very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw uñjasi.
But it was what he said.	Ukampis kuntï jupajj siskäna ukhamänwa.
It’s a little more interesting.	Ukax mä juk’a juk’ampi sumawa.
But that can take a long time.	Ukampis ukham lurañatakejj walja tiempow munasispa.
He didn't say no, but he didn't say yes.	Janiw janiw siskänti, ukampis janiw jïsa siskänti.
He does this two or three times a day.	Urun pä jan ukajj kimsa kutiw uk luri.
And it’s still early.	Ukat wali alwaw purini.
I think it would be interesting though.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali askïspawa ukampis.
I want to say something to him.	Jupar kuns sañ munta.
You don’t have to do that.	Jumax janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.
There wasn’t a single time.	Janiw mä kutis utjkänti.
Someone who knows what to do.	Maynix kuns lurañ yati.
I don't think they know what happened yet.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw jichhakamax yatipkiti sasaw amuyta.
He wanted to say it, but he didn't feel it.	Uk sañ munäna, ukampis janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
To do this, you really need to do two things.	Uk lurañatakix chiqpachapuniw pä lurañax wakisi.
No one wants to talk about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
But it seemed to work.	Ukampis wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I can't think of the word.	Janiw uka arut amuytʼirjamäkti.
The total cost is what is needed.	Taqpach qullqix kunatix wakiski ukawa.
And that’s not possible right now.	Ukat ukax janiw jichhax lurañjamäkiti.
I didn’t know that.	Nayax janiw uk yatkayätti.
Let’s see what he does and why.	Kunsa luraski ukat kunatsa uk luri uk uñjañäni.
There’s a new one.	Ukanx mä machaq.
But it was no problem for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Yes, there is a problem.	Jïsa, kuna jan waltʼäwis utji.
He’ll arrive any time now.	Jupax kuna pachas jichhax purini.
This guy really knows what he wants.	Aka waynax chiqpachapuniw kuntix munki uk yati.
He wants nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurañ munkiti.
I love you all.	Nayax taqiniruw munasta.
No one was speaking.	Janiw khitis arskänti.
I’m thinking of this.	Nayax akham amuyta.
Now you have to do it differently.	Jichhax yaqha tuqit lurañamawa.
I think this is how it used to work.	Nayax amuyta akax kunjams nayrax irnaqäna.
That didn't make sense to him.	Ukajj janiw jupar amuykänti.
I think that's a good thing.	Nayatakejj ukajj wali askiwa.
If you need to move to another country.	Yaqha markar sarañax wakisispa ukhaxa.
It’s a great time there.	Ukanx mä jach’a pachaw utji.
I know all too well how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj wali sum yatta.
He definitely needs to do it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukanak lurañapa.
He’ll be gone for a long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw sarxani.
This is not a movie.	Akax janiw mä película ukhamäkiti.
The time is almost here.	Tiempojj niyaw purini.
He left the day before.	Jupajj mä uru nayraw sarjjäna.
Already he loved it.	Nayratpach jupax walpun munasïna.
I really don’t find it necessary.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasin jikxatkti.
He really didn’t say much.	Chiqpachansa janiw sinti arskänti.
It lasts longer than you.	Jumat sipansa jukʼamp jaya tiempow utji.
But no one said he could do it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurañjamäkiti sasin siskänti.
How he saw it.	Kunjamsa jupajj uñjäna.
I definitely said yes.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jïsa sasaw sista.
Nothing more will be done.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp lurañax utjkaniti.
He wants to be a good person.	Suma sarnaqañ muni.
I had no reason to.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkitänti.
There is work to be done.	Ukanjja lurañaw utji.
I don’t do much here.	Nayax janiw akan walpun lurkti.
And that’s the snow.	Ukat ukax ch’uqi satawa.
And a little bit more than that.	Ukat mä juk’a juk’ampi ukat sipansa.
You really feel good about yourself.	Chiqpachansa juma pachpaw wali sum jikxatastaxa.
But this is pretty cool, too.	Ukampis akax wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
I’ve always seen enough of this.	Nayax nayratpach uka tuqit sum uñjta.
He’s such a nice guy.	Jupax ukhama suma jaqiwa.
I don’t remember anyone on foot.	Janiw khitirus kayuk amtaskti.
It's a little bit like that.	Ukax mä juk'a ukhamawa.
Nothing not at all.	Janiw kunas janiw kunjamatsa.
You are amazing.	Jumax muspharkañawa.
I don't see it anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp uñjkti.
And he didn't care.	Ukat janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
He wants to do it himself.	Jupa pachpa lurañwa muni.
Very large indeed.	Wali jach’a chiqpachansa.
Why is this	Kunatsa aka .
It started to move.	Ukax sarnaqañ qalltäna.
But he doesn't know anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns yatkiti.
Well, those two times, actually.	Ukhama, uka pä kuti, chiqpachansa.
There was little more to do here.	Aka chiqanx juk’amp lurañax juk’akiw utjäna.
I have not seen this letter.	Nayajj janiw aka carta uñjkti.
I’m so happy that it’s worth it.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, ukax wali askiwa.
And that’s the person.	Ukat ukax jaqiwa.
He wasn't sure why, but he knew it.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis uk yatïna.
I can’t say I’m a good person.	Janiw suma jaqïtwa sañjamäkiti.
You know, it’s very difficult.	Jumax yatisktawa, wali ch’amawa.
We just have it.	Jiwasax ukhamakiw utjistu.
I drove straight here.	Nayax chiqaw akan autot sarawayta.
I see everything from here.	Nayax taqi kuns aka chiqat uñjta.
It’s never been very useful.	Janipuniw wali askïkiti.
I don’t know how to say this.	Nayax janiw kunjams akham sañ yatkti.
But, ultimately he’s a lot of fun.	Ukampis, qhipharux jupax wali kusiskañawa.
And, it was.	Ukat, ukhamänwa.
You know what’s coming next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk jumax yatisktawa.
The people are very nice there.	Jaqinakax wali sumaw ukanx utji.
I thanked him for that.	Ukatwa jupar yuspärta.
It’s just really nice.	Ukhama chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I didn't want all that much.	Nayajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa munkayätti.
It’s always seen.	Sapa kutiw uñjasi.
I have been doing this for a long time.	Walja tiempow ukham luraskta.
It’s kind of unusual you know.	Ukax mä kasta jan uñt’atawa jumax yatisktawa.
It’s also awesome.	Ukhamaraki wali muspharkañawa.
After him.	Jupa qhepatjja.
And not financially or emotionally.	Ukat janiw qullqi tuqitsa, chuyma tuqitsa.
You didn’t have to do that to him.	Janiw jupar ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
Except not really.	Jan ukasti janiw chiqpachansa.
Just as you have always done.	Kunjamtï nayrajj lurapkta ukhama.
If he does, he will reach a seemingly impossible conclusion.	Ukham luraspa ukhajja, mä jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa mä amtar purini.
He didn't know what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw yatkänti.
I doubt anyone did.	Khitis ukham luratapat pächastwa.
He just happened to be.	Jupax ukhamakiw pasäna.
It feels heavier.	Ukax juk’amp llamp’u ukhamaw jikxatasi.
There is nothing to do at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I really appreciate this one.	Chiqpachansa akax wali askiwa.
And another, and another, and another.	Ukat yaqha, ukat yaqha, ukat yaqha.
What are your favorite things?.	¿Kunanakas jumatakix wali askïspa?.
He was very strong about it.	Uka tuqitxa jupax wali ch’amampiw arsüna.
I am able to handle it very well.	Nayax wali sum apnaqañ yatta.
I asked him for a moment.	Mä jukʼa tiempow jupar jisktʼta.
I didn't really know about it at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw uka toqet sum yatkayätti.
No, no, not really.	Janiwa, janiwa, chiqpachansa.
And even better.	Ukat juk’amp suma.
I ask where it is.	Nayax kawkhans uk jiskt’asta.
It looks great, but it doesn’t work.	Ukax wali suma uñtatawa, ukampis janiw irnaqkiti.
No one has anything for me here.	Janiw khitis nayatakix kunas akan utjkiti.
People there that.	Jaqinakax ukanx uka.
I hope it happens so soon.	Ukham jankʼakiw lurasiñap suytʼaskta.
I want to make some.	Nayax mä qawqha lurañ munta.
He didn’t and was very disappointed.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkänti ukat wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
So far everything has been good so far.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas jichhakamax wali askiwa.
I can’t find that information.	Nayax janiw uka yatiyäw jikxatkti.
So don't give up too soon.	Ukhamajj jan jankʼak jaytañamäkiti.
The young man left the car.	Waynax autot sarxäna.
It just needs to be.	Ukax ukhamakiw wakisi.
I said I didn’t mean it.	Janiw sañ munkti sasaw sista.
I want to be him.	Nayax jupar tukuñ munta.
There is no way a person could do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa mä jaqejj ukanak lurkaspänti.
I want to get in there.	Nayax uka chiqar mantañ munta.
But he didn't want to make that impression.	Ukampis janiw ukham amuytʼayañ munkänti.
But that quickly died down.	Ukampis ukajj jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
He wanted her for himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupar munäna.
He doesn't like it.	Jupajj janiw uk gustkiti.
I see what you want.	Nayax kuntix jumax munkta uk uñjta.
I never wanted that.	Janipuniw ukanak munkti.
I was at the party for the first time.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw uka fiestan jikxatasiyäta.
Why he lived.	Kunatsa jupax jakasïna.
Nobody but me.	Janiw khitis jan ukasti nayat sipansa.
He arrived very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw purinïna.
It’s been a long time.	Ukax jaya pachaw jikxatasïna.
But I know that I know.	Ukampis uk yattwa yattwa.
At the time, he was in deep distress.	Uka tiemponjja, wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He said we do this every night.	Sapa arumaw ukham lurapkta ukham säna.
I want to see him go that way.	Nayax jupar ukham sarañapatak uñjañ munta.
It’s easy to do, in this case.	Ukax lurañax wali ch’amawa, aka tuqitxa.
Because it wasn’t long ago.	Kunatix janiw nayra pachax utjkänti.
I love you so much!.	Wali munasma!.
I started making the bed.	Nayax ikiñ lurañ qalltawayta.
I decided to have a party.	Mä fiesta lurañaw sasaw amtawayta.
I feel good about all of this.	Taqe ukanak uñjasajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
A few days later, he returned home.	Mä qawqha urunak qhepatjja, wasitatwa utapar kuttʼjjäna.
There’s some power there.	Ukanx mä juk’a ch’amaw utji.
It’s time to let it go.	Uk jaytañ pachaw purini.
And above all else.	Ukat taqi kunat sipansa.
I like it, if anything happens.	Nayatakix wali askiwa, kunas pasaspa ukhaxa.
It needs to be done at this point.	Aka pachanx lurañaw wakisi.
How it felt like that.	Kunjamsa ukham amuyasïna.
That happened to you.	Ukajj jumaruw pasäna.
I decided to join as well.	Nayax ukhamarakiw ukar mantañ amtawayta.
You want to know.	Jumax yatiñ munasma.
So I didn't want to know about it.	Ukhamajj janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkayätti.
The winter is very cold.	Juyphi pachax wali ch’amawa.
I’m waiting for it.	Nayax suyt’twa.
It may be a long process.	Inas jaya tiempo lurañax wakischispa.
That’s what we’re going to do here.	Ukaw akan lurañäni.
But someone else did.	Ukampis mayniw ukham lurawayi.
That was this season.	Ukax aka pachanx ukhamänwa.
Of course, he thought.	Chiqansa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Then he bought a grand piano.	Ukat mä jachʼa piano alasïna.
I don’t say anything.	Janiw kunas uk siskti.
But today it was.	Ukampis jichhürojj ukhamänwa.
I just started again.	Jichhakiw wasitat qalltawayta.
A new book.	Mä machaq libro.
I told him how he could have done better.	Kunjamsa jukʼamp sum luraspäna uk sista.
You don’t have to go too far.	Janiw sinti sarañax wakiskiti.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Nayax janiw aka chiqat kawkirus sarañ yatkti.
The hot breakfast was really nice.	Uka junt’u desayuno ukaxa chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I can't think of anything to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas amuytʼirjamäkti.
For me, it’s good for me.	Nayatakix nayatakix wali askiwa.
He had a great view of the city.	Jupajj markaruw wali sum uñjäna.
I remember that well.	Uka toqet sum amtasta.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Aka chiqat kawkirus sarañax janiw yatkti.
But he knew it well.	Ukampis jupajj sum yatïna.
He doesn't love her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munaskiti.
I’m so happy for you.	Nayax jumatakix walpun kusista.
He didn't even know how to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañsa sum yatkänti.
You don’t want to say that.	Jumax janiw uk sañ munktati.
I am doing the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw luraskta.
You want to work on me you can do it here.	Jumax nayar irnaqañ munta jumax akan lurasma.
It’s a pleasant surprise.	Mä suma muspharkañawa.
He was very happy with himself.	Jupa pachpat wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
This may take an hour.	Ukatakejj mä horaw munasispa.
I’m not going to go through this with you.	Nayax janiw jumamp chika aka tuqit sarañ munkti.
No one knows how to go.	Janiw khitis sarañ yatkiti.
At least for a moment.	Mä jukʼa tiempos ukhamänwa.
I am currently looking for work.	Jichhax irnaqäw thaqhaskta.
Haven’t been for a couple of years.	Mä pä maraw jan ukhamäkiti.
It’s beautiful, obviously.	Ukax wali sumawa, qhanawa.
Just do some creative work.	Jan ukasti mä jukʼa lurañanak lurañamawa.

That’s not the money.	Ukax janiw qullqix utjkiti.
I made the purchase.	Nayax alañ lurawayta.
It’s really kind of unique.	Chiqpachansa mä kasta uñt’atawa.
And let’s see what happened.	Ukat kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
He was accessible to everyone, and everything.	Jupax taqiniruw puriñ yatïna, ukat taqi kunsa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe	Inas, inas, inas .
I think you got the wrong guy.	Nayax amuyta jumax jan wali jaqiruw puri.
There is almost nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa niya janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
In fact, they had nothing.	Chiqansa, jupanakax janiw kunas utjkänti.
He didn’t say where he wanted to go.	Jupax janiw kawkirus sarañ munkta uk siskänti.
I think that would be a good thing.	Ukham lurañajj wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
Or so it seemed.	Jan ukajj ukham amuyasïna.
I don’t want to live.	Janiw nayax jakañ munkti.
He thought I was weird, which he certainly did.	Nayarojj muspharkañawa sasaw amuyäna, ukajj cheqapuniw luräna.
Long long time.	Jaya jaya tiempo.
He didn't want to know all that much.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanakat ukham yatiñ munkänti.
There was room for everything.	Taqi kuna lurañatakix mä chiqaw utjäna.
But they don’t know that.	Ukampis janiw uk yatipkiti.
So, yes,.	Ukhamajj, jïsa,.
All you need is twice as much.	Taqi kunatix wakiski ukax pä kutiw wakisi.
He has been doing this for almost a year.	Niya mä maraw ukham luri.
At what point would the person have done it differently.	Kuna pachas uka jaqix yaqha tuqit luraspäna.
In fact, it felt like one.	Chiqansa, mä ukham amuyasïna.
That meant something.	Ukajj kunsa sañ munäna.
He wanted no one better.	Jupajj janiw khitis jukʼamp sum munkänti.
A snowflake snowflake.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
You never knew what was really in there.	Kunas cheqpachapun ukan utjäna uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
And yes, it never is.	Ukat jïsa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He never wanted her.	Jupajj janipuniw jupar munkänti.
But tonight.	Ukampis jichha arumax.
He knows he has no choice.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti uk sum yati.
This was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I’ve decided to do it.	Nayaw uk amtawayta.
So it took a long time.	Ukhamajj wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
It doesn’t really work that way.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukham irnaqkiti.
Bigger this time.	Jichha kutix juk’amp jach’a.
Pretty long, not too short.	Suma jaya, janiwa sinti jisk’a.
Like, of course, it is.	Kunjamtï, chiqpachansa, ukhama.
No one is here, she told him.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti, sasaw jupar säna.
And then came another such moment.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, yaqha ukham pachaw purinïna.
Extremely sloppy.	Sinti ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He really didn’t want to leave.	Chiqpachansa, janiw sarxañ munkänti.
That made them two.	Ukaw pä jaqir tukuyäna.
He started going every night.	Jupajj sapa arumaw sarañ qalltäna.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parltʼañ munkänti.
Or, maybe, more.	Jan ukax, inas, juk’ampi.
How long no one knows.	Qhawqha tiempos uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But obviously, that’s not the case.	Ukampis qhanaw amuyasi, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to go back to sleep.	Jupajj wasitatwa ikiñar sarañ munäna.
Later, there may be time for dinner.	Qhepatjja, manqʼañatakejj tiempow utjaspa.
It’s time to get things in order.	Kunanaktï mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
She is a woman.	Jupajj mä warmiwa.
But this time I can’t stand it.	Ukampis aka kutix janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
He got it all himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe ukanak katoqäna.
Another chance will come.	Yaqha ch’amaw jutani.
But that’s how it ended.	Ukampis ukhamaw tukuyäna.
He needs to do something about it immediately.	Uka tuqitxa jankʼakiw kuns lurañapa.
I’ve done a lot.	Nayax walja lurawayta.
That’s what we have to do now.	Ukaw jichhax lurañasa.
He’s doing that a lot tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax walpun ukham luraski.
But no one said anything bad.	Ukampis janiw khitis jan walinak arskänti.
We are obviously.	Jiwasajj qhanawa.
I didn't do much.	Janiw nayajj wal lurkti.
So I didn't really understand it.	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun uk amuykayätti.
And never really, or very for that matter again and again.	Ukat janipuniw chiqpachansa, jan ukax wali uka tuqitx mayamp mayamp lurañamäkiti.
He just said that tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax ukhamakiw säna.
It was very cold.	Wali thaya thaya.
I sincerely want to talk about this.	Nayax taqi chuymaw aka tuqitx arsuñ munta.
What is it?' 	¿Kunas ukajja?’ sasa.
Driving there takes a whole day.	Ukar autot sarañajj mä uruw sarañapa.
That’s a long way to go.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw saraski.
That's what you have to do.	Ukajj lurañamawa.
He seems to be a good guy.	Jupajj suma jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
There is no night.	Janiw arumax utjkiti.
Or so he told himself.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupa pachpa säna.
That went somewhere.	Ukaw kawkirus saräna.
He didn't know now at all.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj kunjamatsa yatkänti.
I don't know him.	Nayajj janiw jupar.
But everyone likes it.	Ukampis taqeniw ukajj gusti.
There can be more after that.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw utjaspa.
I want to get out of there.	Nayax uka chiqat mistuñ munta.
But he knew how he felt.	Ukampis kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
Here we get it again.	Akax wasitatwa jikxatasi.
He seriously doesn’t know who he is.	Jupax sinti janiw khitïnsa uk yatkiti.
He needed to do something.	Jupajj kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
Something isn’t right.	Kunas janiw walïkiti.
Somehow, it never happened.	Kunjamatsa, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I know you like that.	Nayax yattwa jumax ukham munasma.
No one knows who he really is.	Chiqpachansa khitïnsa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I'm still worried about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
But this is good in many ways.	Ukampis ukajj walja toqet wali askiwa.
Three days a week.	Semanan kimsa uru.
You have to do something.	Kuns lurañamawa.
I started early.	Nayax nayraqat qalltawayta.
But he was clearly a man of few words.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj jukʼa arunak parlir jaqënwa.
Bad and ugly.	Jan wali ukat jan wali.
He doesn’t, of course.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
No, not really.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa.
Or so he thought at the time.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa uka tiempon amuyäna.
There is no reason for this.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
I've done it several times and it doesn't work.	Nayax walja kutiw lurawayta ukat janiw irnaqkiti.
So you need to do the work on the spot.	Ukhamajj uka cheqan lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
It was wonderful to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He didn't do it right.	Jupajj jan sumwa luräna.
He takes care of these things.	Jupaw ukanak sum uñji.
We need to improve urgently.	Jankʼakiw jukʼamp sum lurañasa.
Very nice room.	Wali suma cuarto.
Any and all types.	Kawkïr ukat taqi kasta.
Someone was doing something.	Mayniw kuns luraskäna.
She is a woman.	Jupajj warmiwa.
I want him to do it again.	Jupajj wasitat ukham lurañapatakiw munta.
Honestly, no one knows.	Chiqpachansa, janiw khitis yatkiti.
I think this happens to everyone.	Nayax amuyta akax taqiniruw pasaspa.
Maybe I'll agree.	Inas nayajj iyaw sista.
Ultimately, he decided.	Qhepatjja, jupaw amtäna.
And it really did the job.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw uka lurañax lurawayi.
He wants to be happy.	Kusisit sarnaqañ muni.
I made the coffee.	Nayax uka café lurawayta.
It’s more difficult.	Juk’ampi ch’amawa.
Only one would suffice.	Mä sapakiw wakisispa.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet yatkänti.
I knew he would never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti uk sum yatiyäta.
I came for nothing.	Nayajj jan kunatsa jutta.
I knew he had done this many times before.	Nayrajj walja kutiw ukham luratayna uk sum yatiyäta.
Have a nice night.	Mä suma arumaw utji.
I don’t know what’s going on here.	Janiw kunas akan pasaski uk yatkti.
He can do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luraspa.
Now that’s really funny.	Jichhax ukax chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
This was when it was.	Akax kunapachas ukhamänwa.
It does a couple of things.	Ukax mä pä lurañanak luraski.
I started working on one.	Mä lurañatak irnaqañ qalltawayta.
He could barely speak.	Jupajj jukʼakiw parlañ puedkänti.
I don't do it anymore.	Nayax janiw juk'amp lurkti.
But don't take it so seriously.	Ukampis janiw ukham sinti jan walinak lurañamäkiti.
He was still half asleep.	Jupajj wali chikat ikiskäna.
He didn't really want one.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun mä munkänti.
He learned well.	Jupajj sumwa yateqäna.
So there’s a way to do it.	Ukhamaw mä lurañax utji.
I think they are something else.	Nayax jupanakax yaqha tuqit amuyta.
Tonight or tomorrow.	Jichha arumax jan ukax qharüruw.
Well, it looks really good.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa wali sumaw uñtasi.
He knew who he wanted.	Jupajj khitirus muni uk sum yatïna.
It’s a very small person.	Wali jisk’a jaqiwa.
I don’t think it’s not.	Nayax janiw janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
Instead, it needs to be done.	Jan ukasti, lurañaw wakisi.
Tell me what you don't know.	Kuntï jan yatkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
He wasn’t like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
And of course it was always raining.	Ukat chiqpachansa sapa kutiw jallu pachax utjäna.
That’s what it takes.	Ukaw wakisispa.
A little bit earlier.	Mä juk’a nayra.
I wasn’t surprised he felt that way, either.	Nayax janiw muspharkayätti jupax ukham jikxatasïna, ukhamaraki.
But this is actually interesting.	Ukampis chiqpachansa akax wali askiwa.
Let’s see.	Uñjañäni.
He didn't want to tell me.	Jupajj janiw nayat yatiyañ munkänti.
He spoke fast and walked faster.	Jupajj jankʼakiw parläna ukat jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He was doing everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa luraskäna.
I thought that was the case.	Ukham sasaw amuyayäta.
Well, it’s very difficult.	Ukhama, wali ch’amawa.
He has the last word.	Jupaw qhip qhipa aru arsu.
And with him.	Ukat jupamp chika.
In fact, it happened many times.	Chiqansa, walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
And, really, what could be better than that?.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ¿kunas ukat sipan jukʼamp askïspa?.
I want something from him.	Nayax jupat kuns munta.
Now it’s not much longer.	Jichhax janiw juk’ampi jaya pachax utjkiti.
It doesn’t work like that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham irnaqkiti.
And he said nothing more.	Ukat janiw jukʼamp kuns siskänti.
Or as it were.	Jan ukajj kunjamtï.
It wasn’t a yes.	Janiw mä jïsa ukhamäkänti.
Of course that is not the case.	Chiqansa janiw ukax ukhamäkiti.
Nothing, maybe.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, inas.
You're still in trouble.	Jumax wali jan walt'äwin jikxatastaxa.
But it cannot be done immediately.	Ukampis janiw jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.
Sure enough, the man did.	Chiqpachansa, uka jaqix ukham luratayna.
But he knew the truth.	Ukampis jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatïna.
I haven’t really seen it.	Janiw chiqpachapuni uñjkti.
I really didn’t know anything else.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha tuqit yatkayätti.
I don’t go to a party like that.	Nayax janiw ukham fiestar sarkti.
I’ve already done that.	Nayax niyaw ukham lurawayta.
And I’m looking for the same thing.	Ukat nayax pachpa thaqhaskta.
I love to eat food.	Nayax manq’añanak manq’añax walpun munta.
But it was never necessary.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
I know better than that.	Nayajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatta.
It won’t be there.	Janiw utjkaniti.
What are you waiting for.	¿Kunsa jumajj suytʼaskta.
It was very, very, very soft and comfortable for me.	Ukanx wali, wali, wali llamp’u ukat sumaw nayatakix utjäna.
But it was a better time.	Ukampis uka tiempojj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
I wanted to tell him that.	Nayajj jupar ukham yatiyañ munta.
I appreciate all you have done for me.	Taqe kuntï nayatak lurapkta ukanakajj walpun yuspärta.
Another place.	Yaqha chiqa.
It happened a little while ago this morning.	Jichha alwajj mä jukʼa tiempow ukham pasäna.
But that wasn't a problem.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Something else will happen.	Yaqha kunaw pasani.
It’s been ten years and it’s going fast.	Tunka maraw purini ukat jank’akiw saraski.
Do whatever you want, it’s okay.	Kuntï munkta uk luram, janiw walïkiti.
No, he didn't want to.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw munkänti.
I’m always here.	Nayax sapa kutiw akanktxa.
He could do what he had to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luraspänwa.
He wants to do that, now.	Jupax ukaruw lurañ muni, jichhax.
I see nothing about what is wrong with him.	Kunatï jupatak jan walïki uka toqet janiw kuns uñjkti.
Neither was available the other day.	Janiw maynix yaqha urux utjkänti.
But it wasn’t, of course.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqpachansa.
Now someone has to do something with him.	Jichhax mayniw jupamp kuns lurañapa.
Whatever you think of it.	Kuntï jumajj amuykta ukajja.
I want that scary.	Nayax uka axsarkañ munta.
I went to the next one.	Nayax jutïr ukar sarawayta.
That is exactly what we should do.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw lurañasa.
That will happen later.	Ukajj qhepatwa utjani.
He finished his meal in silence.	Jupax amukiw manq’añ tukuyäna.
But now the day has come.	Ukampis jichhajj uruw purini.
No one understood why or how.	Janiw khitis kunatsa jan ukajj kunjamatsa uk amuykänti.
I feel like they know what someone is thinking.	Nayax kunjamtï maynix amuyki uk yatipxi sasaw amuyasta.
And, it can be very useful.	Ukat, wali askïspawa.
So you're the one.	Ukhamajj jumajj.
Too okay, maybe.	Sinti walikïskiwa, inas.
A new little one.	Mä machaq jisk’a.
I don’t see this in any way.	Nayax janiw kuna tuqitsa uk uñjkti.
He was once in love.	Jupax mä kutix munasiñampiw sarnaqäna.
One would be very useful.	Maynix wali askïspawa.
I decided to walk home.	Utar kayuk sarañ amtawayta.
I decided to do something.	Nayax kun lurañ amtawayta.
He will come to see you today.	Jichhüruw jumar uñjir jutani.
That’s what we needed.	Ukaw jiwasatak wakisïna.
Of course no one did.	Chiqansa janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
I think it’s funny.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali muspharkañawa.
He knows better than he does.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yati.
Nothing like doing what you want.	Janiw kunas jumax kuntï munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.
And he doesn’t want anything.	Ukat jupax janiw kuns munkiti.
He had no idea where he lived.	Jupajj kawkhansa uka jaqejj jakasïna uk janiw amuykänti.
Slightly smaller as well.	Mä juk’a jisk’a ukhamaraki.
Is this something that needs to be done.	¿Akax kuna lurañas wakisispati.
I love you, yeah.	Nayax jumarux walpun munasta, jïsa.
But for some reason, there was no opportunity to do so.	Ukampis kunatsa, janiw ukham lurañatakejj mä oportunidad utjkänti.
I don’t want to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
Or whatever.	Jan ukax kuna.
He had two hearts.	Jupajj pä chuymaw utjäna.
It’s funny, because it’s so hard.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, kunatix wali ch’amawa.
We’ll do it very soon, too.	Jiwasax wali jank’akiw lurañäni, ukhamaraki.
I know it was for me.	Nayatakix ukhamänwa uk yattwa.
I don’t like cold weather.	Nayax janiw thaya pachax gustkituti.
He went quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw saräna.
It’s always been a winter thing to do.	Nayratpachaw juyphi pachan lurañax utjawayi.
Can’t say it was this time.	Janiw aka kutix ukhamänwa sañjamäkiti.
But one morning.	Ukampis mä alwajj.
I thought everyone knew that.	Nayax taqiniw uk yatipxi sasaw amuyayäta.
And this is really weird.	Ukat akax chiqpachans muspharkañawa.
There is no winter.	Janiw juyphi pachax utjkiti.
It doesn’t make a good gift.	Janiw mä suma regalo lurkiti.
And no one really knows how that happens.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw khitis cheqapuni yatkiti.
But that is clearly not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj qhanawa.
Sorry, no, he said.	Perdón, janiwa, sasaw säna.
It’s never been that way.	Janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
I know he did that.	Ukham luratapat yattwa.
Of course it’s the.	Chiqansa ukax uka...
She will miss him.	Jupajj jupat walpun munasini.
He’s seen this man before.	Jupax nayrax aka jaqiruw uñjäna.
But it seems really good.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
Who is better than me.	Khitis nayat sipansa.
Just happened last week.	Jichhakiw pasïr semanan pasäna.
He hit the mark several times.	Jupax walja kutiw uka markar ch’allt’äna.
He was very quiet at the time.	Jupajj uka tiemponjja, wali amukiw sarnaqäna.
It means nothing to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
He sat up even more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw qontʼasïna.
I told him it wasn’t.	Janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw jupar sista.
Except he wasn’t.	Jan ukasti jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I really don’t want to leave them now.	Chiqpachansa janiw jichhax jupanakar jaytañ munkti.
I can’t remember his name now.	Jichhax janiw sutip amtaskti.
We need to act quickly.	Jankʼakiw kuns lurañasa.
Or when he, whatever.	Jan ukax kunapachas jupax, kunas ukax.
Doing your homework seems like a good idea.	Tareanak lurañax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
There is nothing anyone can do.	Janiw kunas khitis lurkaspati.
He wants to pay for school.	Jupax yatiqañ utar qullqi churañ muni.
I’m sorry, she said.	Nayax llakistwa, sasaw jupax säna.
I was intrigued by an idea.	Mä amuyumpiw walpun muspharta.

It’s doing worse this year.	Jichha marax juk’amp jan waliw luraski.
After a long time, he spoke.	Walja tiempo qhepatjja, jupajj parläna.
It’s really fast.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya.
He’s the one who knows me.	Jupaw nayat yati.
We’ll do everything.	Jiwasax taqi kuns lurañäni.
Good, he thought.	Sumawa, sasaw amuyäna.
This has always been the case.	Ukham lurañax nayratpachaw utji.
I didn’t want that to happen.	Janiw ukham lurasiñap munkayätti.
As if what he said was doable.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhama.
I understand what he is going through.	Kuntï jupajj pasaski uk sum amuyasta.
Don’t leave anyone behind.	Janiw khitirus jaytañamäkiti.
I mean it’s a fact.	Nayax mä chiqaw sañ munta.
I’m going to do something.	Nayax mä juk’a lurañ munta.
And it gets silent.	Ukat ukax amukiw jikxatasi.
He wanted to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañ munäna.
It didn’t do anything.	Ukax janiw kuns lurkänti.
I kind of like that.	Nayatakix mä juk’a ukax wali askiwa.
But do it the way you want.	Ukampis kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam luram.
¡I don't mean that!.	¡Janiw ukham sañ munkti!.
I never saw them again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupanakar uñjkti.
Great, he said.	Jach’a, sasaw säna.
But no one knew much.	Ukampis janiw khitis wal yatkänti.
I’ve always been here.	Nayax nayratpachaw akanktxa.
That wasn't what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw munkänti.
But he loves her very much.	Ukampis jupar wal munasi.
Here, there is none of that.	Akax, janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
They’re very popular.	Jupanakax wali uñt’atawa.
I’ve said this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw uk sañ munta.
It’s definitely better.	Chiqpachansa juk’ampi sumawa.
But I'm not sure how to go about it.	Ukampis kunjamsa uka toqet sarañajj uk janiw sum yatkti.
Nothing really needs to be that big of a deal.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukham jachʼa lurañax wakiskiti.
But he knew one thing.	Ukampis jupajj mä toqetwa yatïna.
That's a good chance.	Ukax mä suma ch'amawa.
We’ll do both.	Panpachaniw lurañäni.
I had the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw utjäna.
I listened to him saying I wanted to give him one.	Mä churañ munta sasaw jupar istʼta.
That was the case in the past.	Ukhamaw nayrajj pasäna.
He said it was.	Jupajj uk sänwa.
That’s almost three.	Ukax niyaw kimsa.
It takes a lot of time.	Ukajj walja tiempow wakisi.
I don’t want anything like this to happen here.	Nayax janiw kunas akanx ukham lurasiñap munkti.
He phoned the car.	Jupax autot telefonot jawsäna.
Do what you can to help him.	Jupar yanaptʼañatakejj kuntï lurañjamäki uk luram.
I think it will be faster.	Nayax amuyta ukax juk’amp jank’akiw utjani.
He said it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uk arsüna.

I really want to be successful.	Nayax sum sarnaqañ wal munta.
But there was something there.	Ukampis kunaw ukan utjäna.
He left me alone.	Jupajj nayaruw jaytawayi.
I don’t remember last summer.	Nayax janiw pasïr verano urun amtaskti.
And a good one.	Ukat mä suma.
But he wanted to do more.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañwa munäna.
Now, that’s unusual.	Jichhax, ukax jan uñt’atawa.
I think he’s pretty cool.	Nayax jupax wali sumaw sasaw amuyta.

Let’s see you guys.	Jumanakar uñjañäni.
We have a great place in this world.	Jiwasax mä jach’a chiqaw aka pachanx utjistu.
Eventually time will catch up with everyone, though.	Qhipharux pachax taqiniruw purini, ukampis.
So it was last night.	Ukhamarakiw qhipa arumax utjawayi.
He didn’t say anything.	Jupax janiw kuns arskänti.
But right now, there’s nothing there.	Ukampis jichhax, janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
This one is called.	Aka maynix satawa.
He wants to take it all away.	Jupajj taqe ukanak apsuñ muni.
One says this, the other says that.	Maynix akham siwa, maynix ukham siwa.
He didn't know where else to go.	Jupajj janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ yatkänti.
I don't know what happened before.	Janiw nayrajj kunas paskäna uk yatkti.
But he didn’t want to stay there.	Ukampis janiw ukan qheparañ munkänti.
But what happened is quite surprising.	Ukampis kunatï paskäna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
I wish he wouldn’t do that.	Nayax jan ukham lurañap munta.
I can’t remember the last time this happened.	Qhip qhipa kutin ukax pasäna uk janiw amtaskti.
He wants something.	Jupajj kunsa muni.
You were so good to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
This requires three steps.	Ukatakejj kimsa lurañaw wakisi.
Here’s how it went.	Akax kunjams sarnaqäna uk uñjañäni.
That’s not really a bad thing.	Ukax janiw chiqpachansa jan walïkiti.
I don't quite know, he thought.	Janiw sum yatkti, sasaw amuyäna.
That was the case now.	Ukajj jichhajj ukhamänwa.
So let me know what is going on.	Ukhamajj kunas pasaski uk yatiyapjjeta.
He has asked you many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jumar mayïna.
I will do it immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw uk lurä.
And more than that, of course.	Ukat ukat sipansa jukʼampiw chiqpachansa.
I know how she feels, she told herself.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
Or a week.	Jan ukajj mä semana.
But it doesn’t cost anything.	Ukampis janiw kuna qullqis munaskiti.
It seemed like an impossibility.	Ukajj mä jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Tell us more about yourself.	Juma pachpat juk’amp yatiyapxita.
He didn't want to go any farther.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jaya sarañ munkänti.
Or lives here.	Jan ukax akan jakasi.
Isn’t that a fact?	¿Janit ukajj cheqäki?
He wanted another word.	Jupax yaqha arunak munäna.
Too many, in fact.	Sinti walja, chiqpachansa.
The brother was still in good shape.	Jilatax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
We were told no.	Jiwasajj janiw sasaw sapjjetäna.
In fact, there is little.	Chiqansa, jukʼakiw utji.

Someone already did.	Maynix nayratpach ukham luratayna.
I don't want him.	Nayajj jupar janiw munkti.
He was more comfortable here with her.	Jupax akan jupamp chikaw juk’amp sum jikxatasïna.
This can be very useful for you.	Ukajj jumatakejj wali askïspawa.
He seemed reluctant.	Jupajj janis munkaspa ukhamänwa.
I don’t know anywhere.	Nayax janiw kawkhans yatkti.
And he wants it.	Ukat jupax munaraki.
I don’t know how to pronounce it.	Janiw kunjamsa uk arsuñ yatkti.
But he meant it.	Ukampis jupajj uk sañ munäna.
I want a driver’s license.	Nayax auto apnaqañ permiso munta.
Not after the letter.	Janiw uka carta qhepatjja.
See here, here and here.	Aka, akan ukat akan uñjañäni.
And I don’t mean ‘we’.	Ukat janiw ‘jiwasax’ sañ munkti.
There seems to be no problem with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
How long it took him, he didn't know.	Qhawqha tiempos jupar pasäna, uk janiw yatkänti.
It does a lot of things well.	Walja lurañanak sum luraski.
I have one myself.	Naya pachpaw mä utji.
He told me the truth.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sitäna.
I came here to do that.	Uk lurañatakiw akan jutta.
But it is very rare.	Ukampis wali jukʼakiw utji.
I don't know his name.	Nayajj janiw sutip yatkti.
There can be no such one.	Janiw ukham maynix utjkaspati.
I never want to see them again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupanakar uñjañ munkti.
I worry about what that is doing to me.	Kuntï ukajj nayatak luraski uka toqet llakistwa.
But, you should never do that.	Ukampis, janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti.
Very soft but still.	Wali llamp’u ukampis wali ch’amawa.
He was doing just fine for someone his age.	Jupajj jupar uñtasit khitirus wali sum luraskäna.
Instead of making your own.	Juman pachpa lurañat sipansa.
I’m sorry the other night.	Nayax yaqha arumax llakistwa.
But I’ve never seen that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham uñjkti.

I went to a real good school.	Chiqpach suma yatiqañ utar sarawayta.
I know the language well.	Nayax uka arut sum yatta.
I didn't say anything to him.	Nayajj janiw kuns jupar siskti.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham lurañama.
He didn't like her very much.	Jupajj janiw jupar wal munkänti.
It’s up to you to do it yourself.	Ukax juma pachpaw lurañama.
So he thought she was still asleep.	Ukatwa jupax wali ikiñan jikxatasi sasaw amuyäna.
As it happened, it didn’t.	Kunjamtï paskäna ukhama, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I can’t do it right now.	Janiw jichhax lurañjamäkiti.
I feel worse than you.	Nayax jumanakat sipansa juk’amp jan waliw jikxatastxa.
I saw it there very well.	Ukanjja, wali sum uñjta.
This is unlikely to happen in the distant future.	Ukajj janiw jutïrin jaya tiempon utjkaspati.
But that was a long time coming.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow pasäna.
I don’t want to pay the full amount.	Nayax janiw taqpach qullqi churañ munkti.

Whatever that means.	Kunjamsa ukajj sañ muni.
But I really have no idea how to do that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa ukham lurañax uk amuykti.

I thought it was really funny.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Tell me what you really think.	Kuntï cheqpachapun amuyta uk yatiyapjjeta.

Well, actually.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa.
He thought it would be better not to do so.	Jan ukham lurañajj wali askïspawa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He sat on the back end.	Jupajj qhep qhepa toqetwa qontʼasïna.
He didn't tell anyone.	Janiw khitirus siskänti.
But the young man would not say no.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw “janiw” sañ munkänti.
You mean to do it.	Jumax uk lurañ sañ munta.

He loves them with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupanakar munasi.
So I am very happy for you.	Ukhamajj jumatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Not much you can do about it.	Janiw sinti uka tuqitxa lurañjamäkiti.
After that, there is nothing.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kunas utjkiti.
Do something, if necessary.	Kuns lurañamawa, wakisispa ukhaxa.
I didn’t want to know that.	Janiw uk yatiñ munkayätti.

There is no half-time.	Janiw chika pachax utjkiti.
This is not the first time he has done this.	Ukajj janiw nayrïr kuti ukham lurkiti.
No, you have to do it first.	Janiwa, nayraqat lurañamawa.
As fast as we can, somehow.	Kunjamtï jiwasajj jankʼak lurañjamäki ukhama, kunjamatsa.
They know everything.	Jupanakax taqi kun yatipxi.

That’s all there is here.	Ukakiw aka chiqanx utji.
I’m going to say the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw sista.
He was walking around a lot.	Jupajj wal sarnaqäna.
Something he saw.	Kunas jupax uñjäna.
He was right, he was in love.	Jupax chiqaw säna, jupax wali munasiñampiw jikxatasïna.

And, it just happened.	Ukat, ukhamakiw pasäna.
Of course, no one really does.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis chiqpachapuni ukham lurkiti.

He saw her for a moment.	Mä jukʼa jupar uñjäna.
Let’s see what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
And he was busy.	Ukat jupax jan tiemponiw sarnaqäna.
Hence, the coffee.	Ukatwa, uka café.
He never knew that.	Janiw kunapachas uk yatkänti.
Or nothing much at all.	Jan ukajj janiw kunas sinti utjkiti.
But it can't be as you say.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukham utjkaspati.
And it’s really fun.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
He felt good about himself.	Jupa pachpaw sum jikjjatasïna.
And nobody wants that.	Ukat janiw khitis uk munkiti.
No one wanted to give him a job.	Janiw khitis jupar mä trabajo churañ munkänti.
I never expected success.	Janipuniw sum sarnaqañ suykayätti.
I love this one a lot.	Nayax aka tuqitx walpun munta.
No one said anything for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
Or, he didn't want to do that.	Jan ukajj, janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
A lot of time and money.	Walja tiempo ukat qollqe.
Well, very good indeed.	Ukhama, wali suma chiqpachansa.
I’m starting to do it a bit these days.	Nayax aka urunakanx mä juk’a lurañ qalltawayta.

I like what we’ve done this year.	Kuntix aka marax lurapkta ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Not after what happened.	Janiw kunatï paskäna uka qhepatjja.

These are perfect for breakfast.	Ukanakax desayuno lurañatakix wali sumawa.
Still unbelievable, actually.	Wali jan iyaw sañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He was so happy somehow, he loved her so much.	Jupax kunjamatsa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna, juparux walpun munasïna.
He didn't understand all of this.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa amuykänti.
How does he know that.	Kunjamsa jupax uk yati.
What we need to do.	Kunas lurañasa.
If something happens to you .	Kunas jumar pasaspa ukhajja .
He said that he felt the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta sasaw säna.
I really, really started from nothing.	Nayax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jan kunat qalltawayta.
I didn’t tell him anything.	Janiw nayax jupar kuns siskti.
Tell me what happens.	Kunas pasani uk yatiyapjjeta.
He wanted something different.	Jupajj yaqha ukhamwa munäna.
In this other case, no.	Aka yaqha tuqitxa, janiwa.
I don’t know why or how or why.	Kunatsa ni kunjamatsa ni kunatsa janiw yatkti.
There’s some time there.	Ukanx mä juk’a pachaw utji.
In fact, twice before.	Chiqansa, pä kutiw nayrax.
To his surprise, there was only one.	Mä sapakiw utjäna, ukajj wal muspharäna.
He didn't ask for anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns mayïna.
So he left for the night.	Ukatwa arumax sarxäna.
He saw blood.	Jupax wila uñjäna.
I’d love to see more of this.	Nayax juk’amp aka tuqit uñjañ munta.
There, he says.	Ukanjja, jupajj akham siwa.
Another blank eye.	Yaqha ch’uqi nayra.
I said nothing, but he knew.	Janiw kuns siskti, ukampis jupajj sum yatïna.
He said something several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw kuns arsüna.
He wondered what was going on.	Kunanakas utji sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But this is exactly the point.	Ukampis akax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
He had been in this situation once before.	Jupajj nayrajj mä kutiw ukham jikjjatasïna.
This is the first time he’s done this.	Akax nayrïr kutiw jupax ukham lurawayi.
I didn’t think so much of it.	Janiw ukham sinti amuykayätti.
Just like I have.	Kunjamtï nayan utjki ukhama.
And he went only once a week.	Ukat semanan mä kutikiw saräna.
I built my own house.	Naya pachpaw uta lurawayta.
Not everything is what you think it is.	Janiw taqi kunas kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.
There’s nothing more.	Janiw juk’ampi utjkiti.
He’s the one who takes care of it.	Jupaw sum uñji.
But he refused to believe it.	Ukampis janiw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
We will do everything we can to do that.	Ukatakejj taqe kunwa lurañäni.
I wasn't sure myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw sum yatkayätti.
But that wasn't what he had.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jupatak utjkänti.
He fell in love with her.	Jupampiw wal munasïna.
He did this many times.	Walja kutiw uk luräna.
It is not necessary anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
He needs more of it.	Jupajj jukʼampiw munasi.
As he was about to .	Kunjamtï jupajj niya .
Everything was scarce.	Taqi kunas juk’akiw utjäna.
That would be good, that would be nice.	Ukax wali askïspawa, ukax wali askïspawa.
At the time, that didn't matter.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
Last night, and tonight, too.	Qhipa arumax, ukat jichha arumax, ukhamaraki.
If anything happens.	Kunas pasaspa ukajja.

I don't think he did.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
I really mean it this time.	Chiqpachansa aka kutix ukham sañ munta.
He’s a little guy now.	Jupax jichhax mä jisk’a jaqiwa.
Everything the guy does is awesome.	Taqi kunatix uka waynax luraski ukax wali muspharkañawa.
I wanted to go there and find out what was going on.	Nayax uka chiqar sarañ munta, ukat kunas pasaski uk yatxatañ munta.
There is nothing unusual here.	Aka chiqanx janiw kunas jan uñt’at utjkiti.
I have no idea how that could happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw amuykti.
We'll take care of him.	Jiwasajj jupar uñjañäni.
Of course no one spoke.	Chiqansa janiw khitis arskänti.
It will take many years.	Walja maranakaw munasini.
Now we have them again.	Jichhajj wasitatwa jupanakajj utjistu.

You don’t want that.	Jumax janiw ukham munktati.

Because that’s what it looks like.	Kunatix ukham uñtatawa.
But you don't have to do too much.	Ukampis janiw sinti kuns lurañajj wakiskiti.
That’s what happens to him.	Ukaw jupar pasaspa.
And therefore.	Ukat ukatwa.
He’s doing so well, it’s really impressive.	Jupax wali sum luraski, chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
It doesn’t work long.	Janiw jaya pachax irnaqkiti.

But this one.	Ukampis akax.
I could have done anything.	Nayajj kuns luraspänwa.

He feels alone.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
It’s just what we do.	Ukax kuntix lurapkta ukhamakiw.
Do it, do it, do it.	Ukham luram, ukham luram.
He died a tragic death.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jiwjjäna.
Anyway, they’re good for you.	Kawkhansa, jupanakax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I’d like to know a little bit more.	Nayax mä juk’a juk’amp yatxatañ munta.
This wasn’t for me.	Akax janiw nayatakix utjkänti.
I have never done a film so fast.	Janiw kunapachas ukham jankʼak mä película lurkti.
I know it now.	Jichhajj yattwa.
And he couldn't speak.	Ukat janiw parlañ puedkänti.
He let out two words.	Jupajj pä arunak apsüna.

You think it’s true.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw sasaw amuyta.

I was so happy, but so sad.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, ukampis wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
But that is rarely the case.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼakiw utji.
It didn't occur to him to do that.	Ukham lurañajj janiw jupatak amuyaskänti.
I really want to do that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurañ munta.
It’s doing really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa luraski.
That’s amazing man.	Ukax muspharkañ jaqiwa.
I'm sure they'll have something in there still.	Nayax yatxatwa jupanakax kunas ukan utjani wali.
He knows, and so do you.	Jupaw yati, jumajj ukhamarakiw yati.
He doesn't do it anymore.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp lurkiti.
It’s going to take a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pacharuw puri.
Now, that hasn’t happened yet.	Jichhax, ukax janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
I didn't understand anything about it.	Ukanakat janiw kuns amuykayätti.
She said that I was too.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw sasaw jupajj säna.

Both, he thought.	Panpachaniw sasaw amuyäna.

But something is happening.	Ukampis kunas pasaski.
An impossible one.	Mä jan lurañjamäki uka.
Here’s one, and here’s another.	Akax mä, ukat akax yaqha.
They told me that.	Jupanakajj ukham sapjjetäna.
And no one thinks there is anything wrong with that.	Ukat janiw khitis uka tuqitxa kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati sasin amuykiti.
He started high school.	Jupax jach’a yatiqañ utan qalltäna.
But I couldn’t do that to him.	Ukampis janiw jupar ukham lurirjamäkti.
He didn't want you here.	Jupajj janiw jumar akan munkänti.
So you have to do it yourself.	Ukhamajj juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
Such a quiet and comfortable place.	Ukham llamp’u ukat suma chiqa.
Someone said something.	Mayniw kuns säna.
I'm not too sure he did that.	Ukham luratapat janiw sinti sum yatkti.
He got to the point.	Jupajj ukaruw purinïna.
We will do it next year, or the year after.	Jutïr maraw uk lurañäni, jan ukajj qhep qhepa maraw lurañäni.
I know it’s far away.	Nayax yattwa wali jaya.
It’s a slow motion.	Ukhamwa amuyasi.

I would do it again.	Nayajj wasitatwa uk luraspäna.
'nothing'.	'janiwa'.
I don’t think he knows anything.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkaspa ukham amuyta.
He left behind a good life, he told me.	Jupax mä suma jakañ jaytawayi, sasaw sitäna.
I did, and he shook it hard.	Nayax uk lurawayta, ukat jupax wali ch’amampiw ch’allxtayäna.
But he feels lonely.	Ukampis sapakiw jikjjatasi.
Much better than you guys.	Jumanakat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
He found it truly remarkable.	Jupajj cheqapuniw wali muspharkañ uñjäna.
He was nice and quick.	Jupajj wali suma ukat jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
That is something you should not miss.	Ukajj janiw jaytañamäkiti.
I didn’t want to leave anyone behind.	Janiw khitirus jaytañ munkayätti.
It seems impossible.	Ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
He never, ever, ever did that .	Jupajj janipuniw, janipuniw, janipuniw ukham lurkänti .
Now, what’s up with this.	Jichhax, kunas akax utji.
I'm still happy to be here.	Wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I don’t see anything there.	Janiw kunas ukan uñjkti.
That wasn't the case for a while.	Ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Today, this is important, but difficult to do.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa, ukampis lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
I mean get out of there.	Nayax uka chiqat mistuñ sañ munta.
He doesn't want to talk to you.	Jupajj janiw jumamp parlañ munkiti.
And I don't know how to do it properly.	Ukat janiw kunjamsa uk sum lurañ yatkti.
I thought that was important.	Ukajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyayäta.
I want to do something.	Nayax mä kuns lurañ munta.
But I was surprised.	Ukampis wal muspharta.
Any way except you.	Kawkïr tuqitsa jan ukax jumax.
That was about three hours ago.	Ukajj niya kimsa horanak nayraw pasäna.
He wanted to know about her.	Jupajj jupat yatiñwa munäna.
There was no money.	Qullqix janiw utjkänti.
He knows it, but he doesn't know how.	Uk yati, ukampis kunjamsa uk yati uk janiw yatkiti.
Or so I thought.	Jan ukajj ukham amuyta.
What are you going to do for me.	Kunas jumax nayatakix lurañama.
There is no breakfast that day.	Uka urux janiw desayuno ukax utjkiti.
It will be a little bit harder.	Mä juk’a ch’amaw utjani.
But eventually it got to me.	Ukampis qhepatjja, nayaruw purinïna.
A young man, too.	Mä waynax ukhamarakiw.
You can be the future.	Jumaw jutïrin utjaspa.
He had no idea what was there.	Kunas ukan utjäna uk janiw amuykänti.
I feel really lovely.	Chiqpachansa wali munasiñampiw amuyasta.
I want to see it for myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak uñjañ munta.
It’s a nice sight for me.	Nayatakix wali sumawa.
He knew what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
But no one knew exactly what it was.	Ukampis kunas uk janiw khitis sum yatkänti.
I didn't know anything.	Janiw nayajj kuns yatkayätti.
He’s one of a kind.	Jupax mä kasta.
That’s how much he wants to work with me.	Ukhamaw jupax nayamp irnaqañ muni.
No one said a thing.	Janiw khitis mä kuns arskänti.
The result was obvious.	Ukham lurasajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
So it's not that bad.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham jan walïkiti.
And then it just sat there.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ukakiw qontʼasïna.
I'm going to say it.	Nayajj sasaw sista.
I want to see something very soon.	Nayax wali jank’akiw kuns uñjañ munta.
You really need to book first.	Chiqpachansa nayraqat libro lurañaw wakisi.
I don't want to do anything better.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañ munkti.
That’s one of the main reasons why that’s so important.	Ukax mä jach’a kunatix ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
The human being can be like that.	Jaqix ukhamarakiw utjaspa.
He knew there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I really don’t know that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk yatkti.
Small amount is not good.	Jisk’a qullqix janiw askïkiti.
I understand what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk sum amuyta.
He said he wanted to talk.	Parlañ munta sasaw säna.
I saw a lot of things.	Walja yänak uñjta.
That has nothing to do with me.	Ukajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkiti.
They are very rare.	Jupanakax wali juk’akiw utji.
Why was he doing this? 	¿Kunatsa ukham luraskäna?
What made this country great.	Kunas aka markarux jach’a tukuyäna.
I did what was right.	Kunatï cheqäki uk lurayäta.
He looked hungry.	Jupax manq’at awtjataw uñnaqäna.
That’s what you need to do.	Ukhamaw lurañax wakisi.
Everything seems possible.	Taqi kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
That’s what he thought of her.	Ukhamaw jupat amuyäna.
But that wasn’t the case that day.	Ukampis janiw uka urux ukhamäkänti.
He’s pretty much in a class by himself.	Jupax niya sapakiw mä clasen jikxatasi.
He wanted to go with her, of course.	Jupampiw sarañ munäna, chiqpachansa.
Very slightly slightly.	Wali ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He was really watching.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uñchʼukiskäna.
I don’t know that stuff.	Janiw nayax uka yänak uñt’kti.
And it doesn’t cost anything.	Ukat janiw kuna qullqis munaskiti.

Do what you want to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkta uk luram.
Very nice and all that.	Wali suma ukat taqi ukanak.

This is especially true.	Uk uñjasajj jukʼampiw amuyasi.
Something like that.	Kunas ukham.
I didn't have anything.	Nayajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
Really, really.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa.
This does not take much time.	Ukatakejj janiw walja tiempojj munaskiti.
That’s a big heart.	Uka jach’a chuyma.
I was terrified myself.	Naya pachpaw wali ajjsarayäta.
I don't know any better.	Janiw jukʼamp sum yatkti.
It also doesn’t work.	Ukhamaraki janiwa irnaqkiti.
Always feel great with you.	Sapa kutiw jumamp wali sum jikxatasïta.
That seems silly for a reason.	Ukax mä amuyumpiw llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasi.
I’m not sure how long it’s been, really.	Nayax janiw qawqha pachas ukax ukx yatkti, chiqpachansa.
I don't want to leave them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar jaytañ munkti.
And there’s no money for that.	Ukat ukatakix janiw qullqix utjkiti.
It wasn’t the first time.	Janiw nayrïr kuti ukhamäkänti.
Good luck to you tomorrow.	Qhipürux jumatakix wali askiwa.
And yes he did it brilliantly.	Ukat jïsa jupax wali sumaw uk lurawayi.
Except for something.	Jan ukasti mä kuna.
The first thing he had to do.	Nayrïr kuntï jupajj lurañapäkäna ukawa.
But you guys.	Ukampis jumanakajj.
It’s really really nice.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
One day he just left.	Mä urux jupax jichhakiw sarxäna.
He died some time ago.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempo nayraw jiwjjäna.
This is what you call it.	Akax jumanakan satawa.
So he didn't want to talk.	Ukhamajj janiw parlañ munkänti.
And he loved it.	Ukat jupajj walpun munäna.
It’s bedtime.	Ukax ikiñ pacharuw puri.
And there’s no money involved.	Ukat janiw qullqix ukan utjkiti.
He threw her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar jaqontäna.
But this is okay for now.	Ukampis akax jichhax walikïskiwa.
He knew it, but he didn't like it.	Uk yatïna, ukampis janiw gustkänti.
A different day.	Mä yaqha uru.
I want to go with you though .	Nayax jumamp chika sarañ munta ukampis .
It’s in bad shape.	Ukax jan walin jikxatasi.
He seems to be a good guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
We’ll take care of that.	Jiwasax uka tuqit sum uñjañäni.
The point was that he didn't have to go.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw sarañax wakiskiti sasaw säna.
Everything happens at once.	Taqi kunas mä kutikiw utji.
Yes means yes and no means no.	Jïsa, jïsa sañ muni ukat janiw janiw sañ muni.
I was not looking forward to this meeting.	Nayajj janiw uka tantachäwir suykayätti.
I didn't want to tell him that.	Janiw nayajj ukham jupar yatiyañ munkayätti.
There was no way he could have done it.	Janiw kunjamatsa jupajj lurkaspänti.
He could have done anything.	Jupajj kuns luraspänwa.
He wasn’t here yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax akan utjkänti.
And a lightweight one.	Ukat mä llamp’u chuyma.
I didn’t think of anything.	Janiw kuns amuyirïkti.
He told me to.	Jupaw nayarojj sitäna.
You may need to make more and more snow.	Inas juk’amp juk’amp ch’uqi lurañax wakischispa.
Of course, one cannot exist without the other.	Chiqansa, maynix janiw maynix jan utjkaspati.
And he did it for a very long time.	Ukat wali jaya tiempow ukham luräna.
So glad to hear that.	Ukhamajj uk istʼasajj wal kusista.
I’m going to you, he said.	Nayax jumaruw saraskta, sasaw säna.
Something is better than doing nothing.	Jan kun lurañat sipansa, kunas jukʼamp askiwa.
But that doesn't make it any better.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jukʼamp askïkiti.
Now he realized that was not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
I know he won’t do that.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukham lurkaniti.
No, he’s still in good shape.	Janiwa, jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
That would be the first step.	Ukaw nayrïr lurañax utjaspa.
Of course, you only need to do this once.	Chiqansa, akax mä kutikiw lurañama.
There was nothing to do.	Ukanjja, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I don’t know what he’s doing.	Janiw nayax kuns luraski uk yatkti.
I don't know much about it.	Janiw walpun yatkti.
If you want to do it, do it.	Jumatix lurañ munsta ukhaxa, luram.
I know what’s going on inside her.	Kunas jupan manqhan pasaski uk yattwa.
His own perhaps.	Jupan pachpa inas.
It was actually better.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
So he went there.	Ukatwa jupajj ukar saräna.
And someone was watching him.	Ukat mayniw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
There’s nothing there for you.	Ukanx janiw kunas jumatakix utjkiti.
Lunch will be served.	Chika uru manq’añax utjani.
I can’t do that from here.	Nayax janiw aka chiqat ukham lurañjamäkiti.
And he thinks that's a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyi.
He decided not to.	Jupajj janiw sasaw amtäna.
For about two weeks.	Niya pä semanaw ukham luräna.
This year he was on his own.	Jichha marax jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
It has done really, really well.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali sumwa lurawayi.
I thought it was too long.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw sasaw amuyayäta.
The first two.	Nayrïr pä.
And he didn't for a while.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw ukham lurkänti.
Of course, he did none of that.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas ukanak lurkänti.
You have to do it, he said.	Jumax uk lurañamawa, sasaw säna.
I decided to see him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjañ amtawayta.
He is happy about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
People don’t know about it.	Jaqinakax janiw uka tuqit yatipkiti.
It does what you want.	Ukaw kuntï munkta uk luraski.
I want to see if I can do that.	Uk lurasmati janicha uk uñjañ munta.
Anyway, that’s okay.	Kawkhansa, ukax walikïskiwa.
He gave me a life.	Jupaw mä jakañ churäna.
But it wasn't for long.	Ukampis janiw jaya tiempojj ukhamäkänti.
Summer really is amazing.	Chiqansa, verano ukax wali muspharkañawa.
I still don't know how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jichhakamajj janiw yatkti.
Kind of very nice.	Mä kasta wali suma.
In fact, he’s beautiful.	Chiqansa, jupax wali sumawa.
He didn't want to come with me.	Jupajj janiw nayamp chik jutañ munkänti.
It really gets there.	Chiqpachansa ukaruw puri.
That’s what he preached with all his heart.	Ukaw taqe chuyma yatiyäna.
That’s always not your best bet.	Ukax sapa kutiw jan jumatakix wali askïkiti.
Tonight the man didn’t notice.	Jichha arumax janiw uka jaqix amuyaskänti.
Or something and something happens to it.	Jan ukax mä kuna ukat kunas ukaruw pasaspa.
It is your responsibility to do so.	Ukham lurañajj jumanakan lurañamawa.
I’ve given up a lot.	Nayax walpun jaytawayta.
I immediately understood what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk jankʼakiw amuyayäta.
He did not like this man.	Jupajj janiw aka jaqejj gustkänti.
But now it was .	Ukampis jichhajj ukhamänwa .
There is a job to be done.	Kuna lurañasa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa walïkiti.
I'm doing fine so far.	Jichhakamax wali sum luraskta.
That was two or three years later.	Ukajj pä jan ukajj kimsa mara qhepatwa pasäna.

And this.	Ukat aka.
And, not everything is true.	Ukat, janiw taqi kunas chiqpachapuni sañ munkiti.
They don’t really know.	Janiw chiqpachapuni yatipkiti.
I think it was pretty good.	Nayax amuyta, wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
But he couldn't eat it.	Ukampis janiw manqʼañ puedkänti.
But he didn't mean that.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkänti.
So it happened to me once or twice.	Ukhamajj mä kuti jan ukajj pä kutiw nayar pasäna.
I don't know how anyone knew.	Kunjamsa khitis uk yatïna uk janiw yatkti.
He is with us now.	Jupajj jichhajj jiwasamp chikaw utji.
It always worked for me.	Nayatakix sapa kutiw irnaqäna.
All day, every day.	Taqi uru, sapa uru.
I think he was happy.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He’s created a safe environment.	Jupax mä jan kuna jan walt’äwin pachaw lurawayi.
But that didn't last long.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jaya tiempojj utjkänti.
He did the same thing.	Jupajj ukham luräna.
Everyone makes a decision.	Sapa mayniw mä amtar puri.
That’s what happened here.	Ukhamaw aka cheqan pasäna.
I'm not sure why he did that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkti.
It was a bloody beautiful night.	Mä wila suma arumaw utjäna.

You can do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw ukham lurasma.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham luratayna.
He didn't know what to say to anyone.	Kuntï khitirus sañ munkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Actually, she thought, it was fun.	Chiqansa, ukax kusiskañawa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
But it was more about him.	Ukampis jukʼampiw jupat parläna.
But that’s not really the case.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
He understood immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw amuyasïna.
I rode both at the same time.	Panpachaniw mä pachpa tiempow kayuk sarawayta.
Something just happened.	Kunas jichhakiw pasäna.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa ukax janiw kunäkisa.
It lasted an hour.	Ukajj mä horaw utjäna.
Everything is still easy now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali ch’amawa.
Those two guys are really good.	Uka pä waynax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I didn't know what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
The same language.	Pachpa aru.
We both like it.	Panpachaniw ukajj gustitu.
That’s how it went.	Ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
So it takes a very long time.	Ukhamajj wali jaya tiempow munasispa.
He says it’s really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw sasaw saraki.
I gave him something.	Nayax juparux kuns churta.
There was nowhere else to go.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax utjkänti.

Overall, he’s in good shape.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
You’re just waiting.	Jumax ukhamakiw suyt’askta.
It is such a big surprise.	Ukham jachʼa muspharkañawa.
I just felt like this.	Nayax jichhakiw ukham jikxatastxa.
But he was just as moved.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
But I’m afraid, and I let myself back in again.	Ukampis axsaratwa, ukat wasitatwa ukar mantañ jaytawayta.
To be honest, there was nothing.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
But these things are beautiful.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj wali sumawa.
It was a morning.	Ukajj mä alwaw utjäna.

That’s the thing.	Ukax ukax.
I thought, you know .	Nayax akham amuyta, jumax yatisktawa .
You’re an adult, you know.	Jumax jilïr jaqïtawa, jumax yatisktawa.
I really don’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax ukham lurkti.
It really started to rain.	Chiqpachansa jallu puriñ qalltäna.
There wasn’t a moment.	Janiw mä juk’a pachas utjkänti.
Let’s see what he does.	Kunsa luri uk uñjañäni.
It’s just what it is.	Kunatï utjki ukakiw.

I know how you feel.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk nayajj yattwa.
It is safe for the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw jan kuna jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.

I had no idea what I was trying to say.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk janiw amuykayätti.
He said everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa arsüna.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupax lurawayi.
Or, not really.	Jan ukax, janiw chiqpachansa.
I worked hard every week.	Sapa semanaw wal chʼamachasiyäta.
I can't really exist.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun utjkaspati.

He could not come to me.	Jupajj janiw nayar jutañ puedkänti.
This is unusual for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
I’m doing something on my own.	Naya pachpaw kuns luraskta.
Overall, it looks fantastic.	Taqi kunat sipansa, wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
But that meant everything to me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj taqe kun sañ munäna.
He got his decision.	Jupajj kuntï amtkäna uk katoqäna.
That’s the right year.	Uka chiqa mara.
It’s really not good, he thought.	Chiqpachansa janiw askïkiti, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Let him know that you need to do this.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi sasaw jupar yatiyañama.
And that doesn't make it any better.	Ukat ukajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
But that would take some work.	Ukampis ukatakix mä jukʼa lurañaw wakisispa.
But that's not all there is to it.	Ukampis ukajj janiw taqe kunäkisa.
You’re still coming on.	Jumax wali ch’amampiw jutta.

The same was not necessary.	Uka pachpajj janiw wakiskänti.
In many cases this is not the case.	Walja kutix janiw ukhamäkiti.
That doesn't mean it's wrong.	Ukajj janiw jan walïkiti sañ munkiti.
We don’t need it here.	Jiwasax janiw akan wakiskiti.
He’s doing what he’s supposed to do and he’s happy.	Jupax kuntix lurañapäki uk luraski ukat jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi.
But he died last year.	Ukampis jupajj pasïr maraw jiwjjäna.
I am so happy to see that now.	Jichhajj uk uñjasajj wal kusista.
No one knew it was coming for him.	Janiw khitis jupatak jutañ yatkänti.
And all of this is good.	Ukat taqi ukanakax wali askiwa.
Don't forget about him.	Jupat jan armasimti.
But that is not the case with this man.	Ukampis janiw aka jaqejj ukhamäkiti.
Nowhere to be found, really.	Janiw kawkhans jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
But here’s the real truth.	Ukampis aka chiqanx chiqpach chiqaw utji.
I’m a guy who likes it.	Nayax mä waynax wali askiwa.
A strange word.	Mä muspharkañ aru.
It wasn't like that now.	Janiw jichhajj ukhamäkänti.
A school, once.	Mä yatiqañ uta, mä kuti.
You weren’t sure what was inside.	Kunas uka manqhan utjäna uk janiw sum yatkayätati.
There, he felt very comfortable.	Ukanjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
And that’s exactly what happened.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw ukax pasäna.
I take good care of him, don’t forget.	Nayax juparux wali sum uñjta, jan armasimti.

He felt good, now.	Jupax wali sumaw jikxatasïna, jichhax.
I have no idea what was going on there.	Kuntï ukan luraskäna uk janiw amuykti.
I’m getting more and more.	Nayax juk’ampi juk’ampi.
He did not drink much.	Jupajj janiw sinti umañ yatkänti.

I’ve only seen this twice.	Nayax pä kutikiw uk uñjta.

He took it out of me.	Jupaw nayan apsüna.
I did what you wanted me to do, you know.	Nayax kuntix jumax lurañ munkta uk lurawayta, jumax yatisktawa.
I finally did it.	Nayax qhipharux uk lurawayta.

It really seemed like he knew.	Chiqpachansa, jupax yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
I think it’s pretty cool.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali ch’amawa.
He doesn't understand as well as you do.	Jupajj janiw jumar uñtasit sum amuykiti.
I asked him what happened.	Kunas pasäna sasaw jupar jisktʼta.
He did very well there.	Ukanjja wali sumwa luräna.

When he got there, he was still happy.	Ukar purisajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

Then something strange happened.	Ukat mä muspharkañ kunaw pasäna.
He talked about how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uka toqetwa parläna.
He never did something twice, it was.	Janipuniw pä kutis mä kuns lurkänti, ukhamänwa.
No problem, but it will take longer.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti, ukampis jukʼamp tiempow munasini.

Don’t make up a single sentence.	Janiw mä sapa arunak lurañamäkiti.
He didn't notice anything but something.	Jupajj janiw kunsa amuyaskänti, jan ukasti kunas utjäna.

And somewhere he took some money.	Ukat kawkhansa mä jukʼa qollqe apsüna.

He wasn't sure why, but he said it was fine.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti, jan ukasti walikïskiwa sasaw säna.

I’m sure he will, of course, though.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax ukham lurani, chiqpachansa, ukampis.

Certainly the night would be better.	Chiqansa, arumax jukʼamp askïspawa.

But, eventually, he agreed to do one.	Ukampis, qhepatjja, mä lurañwa iyaw säna.
But you just need opportunity.	Ukampis oportunidad ukakiw munasispa.

But he felt something else.	Ukampis yaqha toqetwa amuyasïna.
The same thing is necessary.	Uka pachpaw wakisi.
You time this.	Jumax tiempo aka.

Two days a week.	Semanan pä uru.
This is not my year.	Akax janiw nayan marax utjkiti.
The first day is tough.	Nayrïr urux wali ch’amawa.
But it’s just that.	Ukampis ukhamakiw.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañsa janiw yatkänti.
I don't want to talk about him anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp jupat parlañ munkti.
I want to say something to him but whatever it takes.	Nayax juparux kuns sañ munta ukampis kunas wakisispa.
There are no two worlds.	Janiw pä pachax utjkiti.
He would have done very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa luraspäna.
How long can the day go by.	¿Qhawqha tiempos uka urux pasaspa.
I’m looking forward to it soon.	Nayax jank’akiw suyt’askta.

So he has to do it.	Ukhamajj jupajj lurañapawa.
I told him that on the phone.	Nayax telefonot ukham jupar sista.
I immediately became obsessed with it.	Ukat jankʼakiw uka toqet sinti llakista.
He rubbed his eyes tightly.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
All of these are agreed.	Taqi ukanakax iyaw satawa.
I was never quite sure.	Janipuniw nayajj sum yatkayätti.
But it never existed then.	Ukampis janipuniw uka tiempon utjkänti.
I want to know what the problem is.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk yatiñ munta.

In this respect, he is a good man.	Uka tuqitxa, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

I felt that way, everywhere.	Nayax ukham jikxatasiyäta, taqi chiqan.
He wasn't sure what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He never wanted to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurañ munkänti.
I never liked them.	Janipuniw jupanakajj gustkituti.
He was lying quietly.	Jupajj amukiw ikiskäna.
That’s what it is right now.	Ukax jichhax utjki ukawa.
The guy is a bad guy.	Uka jaqix jan wali jaqiwa.
That’s a very difficult one.	Ukax mä wali ch’amawa.
He must go with you.	Jupaw jumamp chika sarañapa.
That’s just once.	Ukax mä kutikiw.
It needs to be done better.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisi.
Anything after that doesn't matter to me.	Uka qhepat kunas nayatakejj janiw wakiskiti.
Also, this is good.	Ukhamaraki, akax wali askiwa.
I think it’s awesome.	Nayax amuyta wali muspharkañawa.
But then he wondered why not.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunatsa jan ukhamäki sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Well actually yes, it is.	Suma chiqansa jïsa, ukhamawa.
Tell me something.	Kuns yatiyapxita.

It’s also very nice.	Ukhamaraki wali suma.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas jan walïkiti.
But now he knew better.	Ukampis jichhajj jukʼamp sum yatïna.
Somehow it never happened.	Kunjamatsa janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He has no idea what is coming.	Kunas jutani uk janiw amuykiti.
It’s what he was doing, of course.	Ukax kuntix jupax luraskäna ukawa, chiqpachansa.
He moved a little too quickly.	Jupax mä juk’a jank’akiw sarnaqäna.
There’s nothing he can really do.	Janiw kunas jupax chiqpachapunix ukham lurkaspati.
That seems to have happened in this case.	Ukaw aka tuqitxa pasäna sasaw amuyasi.
He can do just that.	Jupax ukhamakiw luraspa.
I feel this too.	Nayax ukhamarakiw akax jikxatastxa.
But to you guys.	Ukampis jumanakar.
He appreciated it.	Jupajj ukanak wali askit uñjäna.
But he understood her eyes.	Ukampis nayranakap sum amuyäna.
I felt really bad about myself.	Chiqpachansa naya pachpat jan waliw jikxatasiyäta.
But that last one is worth it.	Ukampis uka qhep qhepa lurañajj wali askiwa.
I think that is a good thing for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
In the first case .	Nayrïr tuqitxa .
But he’s awesome.	Ukampis jupax wali muspharkañawa.
This will last about two days.	Ukax niya pä uruw utjani.
Now he asked himself.	Jichhajj jupa pachpaw jisktʼasïna.
It wasn’t, he said.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, sasaw säna.
And everything will be just that.	Ukat taqi kunas ukhamakiw utjani.

So there won't be that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj utjkaniti.
But that was not the case now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He has done this many times before.	Jupajj nayrajj walja kutiw ukham lurawayi.
There is such a thing as doing it.	Ukham lurañaw utji.

And this wasn’t the case.	Ukat akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
There are two things, really.	Pä kunaw utji, chiqpachansa.
He couldn't talk to her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp parlañ puedkänti.
He wants to say something.	Jupax kuns sañ muni.
I don’t think anyone is right with me.	Nayax janiw khitirus chiqapar uñjkti nayamp chika.
He thought he knew everything.	Jupajj taqe kun yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
Great, great, great!.	¡Jach’a, jach’a, jach’a!.
But maybe you can do that.	Ukampis inas ukham lurasma.
Next time, next time.	Jutïr kutin, jutïr kutin.
He didn’t say that, of course.	Jupax janiw ukham siskänti, chiqpachansa.
That seems to be a good thing.	Ukax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
That’s been good so far.	Ukax jichhakamax wali askiwa.
There’s the bedroom door.	Ukanx ikiñ uta punku.
But I hope it won't be much longer.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaniti sasaw suytʼaskta.
I want to talk to him.	Nayajj jupampiw parltʼañ munta.
I don't know exactly what happened there, but what happened.	Ukan kunas pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti, jan ukasti kunas pasäna.

Or whether you want it or not.	Jan ukajj munasmati janicha.
No one ever goes.	Janiw khitis janipuniw sarkiti.
That’s more or less the case now, of course.	Ukax jichhax juk’amp jan ukax juk’amp ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
Until recently, I thought so.	Jichhakamajj nayajj ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
He thought it was never necessary.	Janipuniw wakiskiti sasaw amuyäna.
I’m in a bit of trouble.	Nayax mä juk’a jan walt’äwin jikxatastxa.
No one had ever done anything like this before.	Janiw khitis nayrajj ukham kuns lurkänti.

Something just happened.	Kunas jichhak pasäna.
It should take a day or two to do the work.	Mä uru jan ukajj pä uruw uka lurañanak lurañapa.

There was something about that night.	Uka arumax mä kunaw utjäna.

Everything is fine with me.	Taqi kunas nayatakix walikïskiwa.

He thoroughly enjoyed his time with me.	Jupajj nayamp chika tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
You can’t have it.	Jumax janiw utjkaspati.
There are three ways to do this.	Uk lurañatakix kimsa lurañaw utji.

So it just keeps going.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw saraski.
I’m sorry, he repeated.	Nayax llakistwa, sasaw wasitat säna.
Let's see what he does.	Kunsa jupajj luraski uk uñjañäni.

But that doesn't matter now.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jichhajj kunäkisa.
Instead, he called.	Jan ukasti, jupaw jawsäna.
A bad kind of thing.	Mä jan wali kasta.
So, it was very difficult for me.	Ukhama, nayatakix wali ch’amaw utjäna.
It takes a year to do this.	Uka lurañatakix mä maraw munasispa.
He was the only one.	Jupa sapakiw utjäna.

And he always told me something else.	Ukat sapa kutiw yaqha tuqit sitäna.

So today, he's what's going on.	Ukhamajj jichhürunakanjja, jupajj kunas pasaski.
But we must act quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw kuns lurañasa.
But doing that and doing it is really hard.	Ukampis ukham lurañasa ukat lurañasa, chiqpachansa chʼamakiwa.
There was nothing about him.	Janiw kunas jupat utjkänti.
Where was he now?.	¿Jichhajj kawkinsa utjäna?.
It felt like a long time, actually.	Walja tiempos ukhamwa amuyasïna, chiqpachansa.
But he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
He died three weeks later.	Kimsa semana qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
I’ve always wanted to see it but never did.	Nayax nayratpachaw uñjañ munta ukampis janipuniw uñjkti.
Bigger and faster.	Jach’a ukat juk’amp jaya.

He quickly learned one thing.	Jupajj jankʼakiw mä toqet yateqäna.
Tomorrow there again.	Qhipürux ukanx wasitatwa.
He doesn’t want to go to school today.	Jupax jichhürunakanx janiw yatiqañ utar sarañ munkiti.
He didn't know when he would.	Jupajj janiw kunapachas ukham lurañap yatkänti.
There’s never a past.	Janipuniw mä nayra pachax utjkiti.

I actually started doing that.	Chiqansa ukham lurañ qalltawayta.
He was right about me.	Jupajj nayat cheqapuniw säna.
Why did he come? 	¿Kunatsa jupajj jutäna?
He just keeps going.	Jupax ukhamakiw saraski.
He doesn't know anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus yatkiti.
It takes some time.	Mä juk’a pachaw munasispa.
He did it for me.	Jupaw nayatak uk luräna.
Well, don’t go any further.	Ukhama, jan juk’ampi.

You are a different person.	Jumax yaqha jaqiwa.
Well, that’s awesome.	Ukhama, ukax wali muspharkañawa.
Everything is old.	Taqi kunas nayra.

I really don’t know much about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit wal yatkti.

And the facts are clear.	Ukat kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanawa.

Now tell me, he says, how you see it.	Jichhax yatiyapxita, jupax siwa, jumax kunjams uñjta ukxa.

You have to do better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurañama.
But he said nothing to help.	Ukampis yanaptʼañatakejj janiw kuns siskänti.

But he didn't tell them.	Ukampis janiw jupanakar siskänti.
Maybe that's why you feel like you wanted it.	Inas ukatwa jumajj ukanak munkayäta ukham amuyasta.
It was cold and cozy.	Thaya ukat wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
He didn’t want anything to happen.	Janiw kunas pasañap munkänti.

He didn’t know what to do with himself.	Jupax janiw kuns jupa pachpat lurañ yatkänti.

For a while that doesn't matter.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj ukajj janiw kunäkisa.

He always looked like that.	Jupajj sapa kutis ukham uñnaqäna.
But no, he didn't like that.	Ukampis janiw, ukajj jupar gustkänti.

He just went for it.	Jupajj ukatakejj ukhamakiw saräna.
Are you not?.	¿Janit jumax?.
But don't do that.	Ukampis janiw uk luramti.
He will love everyone.	Jupax taqiniruw munasini.
He could do things on his own.	Jupajj sapakiw kuns luraspäna.
Let’s do something about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañäni.

Of course this is obvious.	Chiqansa ukax qhanaw uñjasi.
And he repeatedly asked her to do so.	Ukat walja kutiw ukham lurañapatak mayïna.
Somehow, it does nothing.	Kunjamatsa, janiw kuns lurkiti.

I can’t remember a time when he didn’t want it.	Mä tiempox janiw amtaskti, kunapachatï jupax jan uk munkäna ukhaxa.
Wine, of course.	Vino, chiqpachansa.
Well, sort of.	Ukhama, mä kasta.
That’s the way it is at the moment.	Ukhamaw jichha pachanx jikxatasi.
So it was more of a ride.	Ukhamajj jukʼampiw mä autot sarañajj wakisïna.

He said he had it in his bedroom.	Jupax ikiñ utapan utjitu sasaw säna.
Let’s see what he does next.	Kunsa jutïrin lurani uk uñjañäni.
I didn’t want the money.	Nayax janiw qullqi munkayätti.
To this day, no one knows what happened.	Jichhakamajj janiw khitis kunas paskäna uk yatkiti.

But he’s gone a lot.	Ukampis jupax walpun sarxi.

That is what he could do.	Ukaw jupajj luraspäna.

Not about that, either.	Janiw uka tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
He had a wonderful stay.	Jupajj wali sumwa qheparäna.
I don't want to talk about it with anyone.	Janiw khitimpis uka toqet parlañ munkti.
He repeated this several times.	Ukjja walja kutiw wasitat arsüna.

This is interesting though.	Akax wali askiwa ukampis.

He did it to avoid me.	Jupajj jan nayar sarañatakiw ukham luräna.

Or that it doesn’t know anything.	Jan ukax ukax janiw kuns yatkiti.

They often don’t.	Jupanakax walja kutiw jan.
This is what he found.	Akax jupaw jikxatasïna.

That is better for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj jukʼamp askiwa.
He was a one-of-a-kind.	Jupajj mä sapa jaqënwa.
That’s what I think, but I’m not sure.	Ukhamaw nayax amuyta, ukampis janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
Well, that’s a no, by the way.	Ukhama, ukax mä janiwa, ukhama.
I was misunderstood.	Nayajj jan wal amuyayäta.
Why would it be necessary to do so.	Kunatsa ukham lurañax wakisispa.
It really feels that way.	Chiqpachansa ukhamwa amuyasi.
And he doesn’t know that.	Ukat jupax janiw uk yatkiti.
During that time, he felt better.	Uka tiemponjja, jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasïna.
I don’t like the coffee.	Nayax janiw uka café ukarux gustkituti.
He was very active.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw sarnaqäna.
Now I doubt it will ever happen.	Jichhajj kunapachas ukham pasani sasaw pächasta.
He didn't know much about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkänti.
I never wanted to eat breakfast.	Janipuniw desayuno manqʼañ munkayätti.
There were no minorities.	Janiw jukʼa jaqenakajj utjkänti.
It doesn’t have anything to do with me.	Janiw nayamp kuns lurkiti.
But he seemed very serious.	Ukampis wali jachʼa chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
He did that a lot these days.	Jupax aka urunakanx walpun ukham luratayna.
But he is a very small man.	Ukampis jupax wali jiskʼa jaqiwa.
But not everyone liked him that much.	Ukampis janiw taqenis jupat ukham gustkänti.
It cannot be done better.	Janiw jukʼamp sum lurañjamäkiti.
He wanted someone who was real.	Jupajj khitirus cheqpach munäna.

It was about what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uka toqetwa parläna.
But that’s all it can be.	Ukampis ukakiw utjaspa.

He couldn't do anything about it now.	Jichhajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurañ puedkänti.
He called them out.	Jupaw jupanakar jawsäna.
Probably not again, after what happened.	Inas jan mayampsa, kunatï paskäna uka qhepatjja.
All of this makes me very happy.	Taqe ukanakajj nayatakejj wali kusiskañawa.
Just like he always did.	Kunjamtï jupajj nayratpach lurkäna ukhama.

This was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.

All of these are valid.	Taqi ukanakax walikïskiwa.
This was the first time he had received such help.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham yanaptʼa katoqäna.
Of course, he did nothing about it.	Chiqansa, janiw uka tuqitxa kuns lurkänti.

And he was right about that.	Ukat uka tuqitxa chiqaw säna.

Later in the day.	Uka urux qhipharux.

All of this is obvious.	Taqi ukanakax qhanaw uñjasi.

Not that I really knew anything, except that I knew more.	Janiw chiqpachansa kunsa yatkayätti, jan ukasti jukʼampiw yatkayätti.

You have to do something good.	Jumax mä suma lurañamawa.
I think that’s really all that matters right now.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachansa ukakiw jichhax wakisi.
I’d rather have that.	Nayax ukax juk’amp askiwa.
But something is better than nothing.	Ukampis kunas jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
He was getting more and more depressed.	Jupajj jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
Amazing, don’t you think?.	Muspharkañawa, ¿janit jumax amuyta?.
They had nowhere else to go.	Jupanakajj janiw yaqha cheqar sarañatak utjkänti.
I don’t see it that way.	Nayax janiw ukham uñjkti.
No one wanted to do anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurañ munkänti.
It is not necessary after that time.	Uka tiempo qhepatjja janiw wakiskiti.

Today he may not know.	Jichhürunakan inas jan yatkchiti.
But it’s obviously wrong.	Ukampis qhanaw jan walïkiti.
No one knows how.	Janiw khitis kunjamsa uk yatkiti.
This past year has been very difficult for me.	Aka qhipa marax nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
I was told that there was no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti sasaw sapjjetäna.
But with great power comes great responsibility.	Ukampis jachʼa chʼamampiw jachʼa lurañanak utji.
This requires another step.	Ukatakejj yaqha lurañaw wakisi.
I didn’t want to leave the country.	Janiw uka markat sarxañ munkayätti.
Even a bad cold.	Nayraqat mä jan wali thaya.
The better the better.	Jukʼamp sum lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
I don’t think it costs anything.	Nayatakix janiw kunas qullqix munaskiti.
The young man went with him.	Uka waynax jupamp chikaw saräna.
Now I never had a chance to do it.	Jichhax janipuniw mä ch’am lurañax utjkitänti.
He didn’t have enough to eat.	Jupax janiw manq’añax utjkänti.
But they obviously don't like the way things are going now.	Ukampis qhanaw kunjamsa jichhajj kunas pasaski ukajj janiw jupanakar gustkiti.
The guy doesn’t do that.	Uka waynax janiw ukham lurkiti.
I personally enjoy it.	Naya pachpaw ukajj wali kusiskañawa.
So we have to do it right.	Ukhamajj sumwa lurañasa.
But someone really knows how to do something.	Ukampis maynix chiqpachapuniw kuns lurañ yati.
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.	Mä juk’a aka, mä juk’a uka.
Tell him half an hour.	Chika horaw jupar yatiyañama.

He was doing it alone.	Jupajj sapakiw uk luraskäna.

But today there was none.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw kunas utjkänti.
Now we have an opportunity to do that.	Jichhax ukham lurañatakix mä oportunidad ukaniwa.
Something’s pretty great.	Kunas wali jach’a.

Now he’s acting amazing.	Jichhax jupax muspharkañ sarnaqaski.
I am really sad today.	Jichhürunakanxa chiqpachansa llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I don’t want to do that in two ways.	Nayax janiw pä tuqit ukham lurañ munkti.
No matter, she decided.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
It’s that amazing.	Ukham muspharkañawa.

There was no filming.	Janiw kuna película lurañas utjkänti.
The timing is right.	Uka tiempojj walikïskiwa.
He meant to her.	Jupajj jupar sañ munäna.
But something surprised him.	Ukampis mä kunaw jupar muspharäna.
This is exactly what it means to me.	Akax chiqpachapuniw nayatakix sañ muni.
The rest is all too familiar.	Uka qhipharux taqi kunas wali uñt’atawa.
That’s the time for me.	Uka pachax nayatakix wali askiwa.
But he didn’t want to do it, of course.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
Day and that.	Uru ukat uka.
I don’t think it’s fair.	Nayax janiw chiqapar uñjkti.
I don’t know where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw yatkti.
I need to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Of course, you don’t.	Chiqansa, jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Things weren’t like that.	Kunanakas janiw ukhamäkänti.
A very spacious place.	Mä wali jach’a chiqa.
It gave up very quickly.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw jaytawayi.
And it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
I don’t, not really, but that doesn’t matter.	Janiw nayax ukham lurkti, janiw chiqpachansa, ukampis ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Where does he go from here?.	¿Kawkirus jupax aka chiqat saraski?.
I think it looks better.	Nayax amuyta ukax juk’amp suma uñtatawa.
It was doing very well.	Wali sum luraskäna.
But at the time, I had no idea about it.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, janiw uka toqet kuns amuykayätti.
Amazing place, this.	Muspharkañ chiqa, aka.
Always faster came the snow.	Sapa kutiw juk’amp jank’ak ch’uqi jutäna.
The room itself was very very nice.	Uka cuarto pachpajj wali wali sumapunïnwa.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumar wal munasi.
That’s how it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisispa.
It took about an hour.	Ukatakejj niya mä horaw munasïna.
So it's not the way it should be.	Ukhamajj janiw kunjamtï lurañajj wakiski ukhamäkiti.
He says everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa arsu.
It had to be done a little bit.	Mä jukʼa jukʼa lurañaw wakisïna.
That, where to find it, where to find it!.	Ukax, kawkhans jikxatasi, kawkhans jikxatasi!.
Never give up on them.	Janipuniw jupanakar jaytañamäkiti.
And immediately he knew exactly what he wanted.	Ukat jankʼakiw kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
I want to leave him like that.	Nayax juparux ukham jaytañ munta.
Nothing seemed to work.	Janiw kunas askïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
But, it’s not like that.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Finally there was room for me.	Qhipharux nayatakix mä chiqaw utjäna.
He was curious about it.	Jupajj uk yatiñ wal munäna.
Now he knows for sure.	Jichhajj cheqapuniw yati.
I didn't know that well.	Nayajj janiw ukham sum yatkayätti.
But we are the ones.	Ukampis jiwasajj.
I immediately agreed.	Ukat jankʼakiw iyaw sista.
Tell us what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
Do all the necessary things on time.	Taqi kunatï wakiski ukanak horasapar lurañamawa.

There’s both.	Ukax panpachaniw utji.
I definitely want to buy one.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw mä alañ munta.
But it’s also.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw.
So it's just difficult.	Ukhamajj chʼamakiwa.
He had nowhere to go.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañatak utjkänti.
He had no idea what he was going to do about it.	Kunsa uka toqet lurani uk janiw jupajj amuykänti.
Of course you can do that.	Chiqansa jumax ukham lurasma.
Do her homework here when she needs it.	Tareanakap akan luram kunapachatï jupax munki ukhaxa.
I can't figure out why.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
I didn't want him.	Nayajj janiw jupar munkayätti.
He was really rude.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jan wali arunak arsüna.
So what is he again.	Ukhamajj kunas jupajj wasitat.
But there is only certainty.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukakiw utji.
He said he needed to do the right thing.	Ukat kunatï cheqäki uk lurañaw wakisi sasaw säna.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
He could not go to work.	Jupajj janiw irnaqäwir sarañ puedkänti.
Now here’s why.	Jichhax akax kunatsa.
And yes, yes, yes.	Ukat jïsa, jïsa.
I never said anything like that.	Janipuniw ukham arunak siskti.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Janiwa, manq’añ muni, sasaw saraki.
I've done something wrong.	Jan walinak lurawayta.
Everyone knows about this.	Taqinipuniw aka tuqitx yatipxi.
So he never said much to her.	Ukhamajj janipuniw jupar sinti siskänti.
He has no idea what to do.	Jupajj kuna lurañas wakisispa uk janiw amuykiti.
Then I heard him on the phone.	Ukat telefonot parlir istʼta.
I don't remember a thing before that.	Uka nayrajj janiw mä kunsa amtaskti.
In fact, he was actually worried.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
But I didn't go.	Ukampis nayajj janiw sarkti.
That's good, too.	Uka suma, ukhamaraki.
That was one day.	Ukajj mä uruw utjäna.
That is why we went to you.	Ukaw kunatsa jumanakan ukar sarapjjta.
Kind of, not really.	Mä kasta, janiw chiqpachansa.
It is amazing to do what you love every day.	Sapa uru kuntï munkta uk lurañajj wali muspharkañawa.
But, it happened.	Ukampis, ukham pasäna.
I am so glad he did so well.	Ukham sum luratapat wal kusista.
He made it seem impossible.	Jupax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham luratayna.
You’re just like that.	Jumax ukhamakiw.
He's that and that.	Jupax uka ukat uka.
This was the first time that had happened.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham pasäna.
Warm water.	Junt’u uma.
But he wanted more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw munäna.
It was a wonderful experience for me.	Nayatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
That’s what he has.	Ukaw jupajj utji.
He wanted red wine.	Jupax wila vino munäna.
I thought that meant something.	Ukajj kuns sañ munkaspa ukhamwa amuyayäta.
He had a reason for doing so.	Jupajj ukham lurañatakejj kuna razonas utjäna.
I think someone was right about you.	Nayax amuyta, maynix chiqpachapuniw jumat arsüna.
We all have these things.	Taqeniw ukanak utjistu.
That’s definitely not the case.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan ukhamäkiti.
But that is not enough yet.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jichhakamax wakiskiti.
What to do, what to do.	Kunsa lurañasa, kunsa lurañasa.
That is not what you are saying.	Ukajj janiw kuntï siskta ukhamäkiti.
He died less than a year later.	Jupajj janïr mä mara qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
And of course, it’s very difficult.	Ukat chiqansa, wali ch’amawa.
But I think that would be good.	Ukampis ukajj wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
Wanted once in a while, maybe.	Munat mä kutix, inas.
You’re a woman.	Jumax warmiwa.
That is what all of this is all about.	Ukaw taqe ukanakajj utji.
She is a very happy woman.	Jupax wali kusisit warmiwa.
Now this is better for me.	Jichhax akax nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.
But no one spoke up.	Ukampis janiw khitis arskänti.
He lived with her for two years.	Pä maraw jupamp jakasïna.
And somehow he said yes.	Ukat kunjamatsa jïsa sasaw säna.
I would love to see you.	Nayajj jumar wal uñjañ munta.
This will require a little more work.	Ukatakix mä juk’amp lurañaw wakisini.
He thought that was a good idea.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
He doesn’t want to go out.	Jupax janiw mistuñ munkiti.

In fact, he said he knew nothing about it.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna tuqitsa yatkiti sasaw säna.
He’s doing everything right.	Jupax taqi kuns sum luraski.
And he knew exactly when.	Ukat kunapachas uk sum yatïna.
After all you don’t need money.	Taqi kunat sipansa janiw qullqix wakiskiti.

He knew better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatïna.
Well, the house doesn’t have that.	Ukhama, uka utax janiw ukax utjkiti.
It’s not our snow.	Janiw jiwasan ch’uqi.
I’m still hugely disappointed.	Nayax wali jach’a llakitaw jikxatastxa.
Doesn’t mean it’s wrong.	Janiw jan walïkiti sañ munkiti.
I have no idea what he is doing.	Kuntï jupajj luraski uk janiw amuykti.
I had no idea where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
I thought that was her best.	Ukajj jupat sipansa wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Or he thinks he knows.	Jan ukajj yattwa sasaw amuyi.

He went there with great joy.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uka cheqar saräna.

He wasn't sure who it was.	Jupajj khitis ukajj uk janiw sum yatkänti.
But it is not and never will be.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti ukat janipuniw ukhamäkiti.

In an unknown country.	Mä jan uñt’at markan.

Now, and always.	Jichhax, ukat sapa kutiw.

There is no other cost to you.	Janiw yaqha qullqix jumatakix utjkiti.
But then he could do it.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jupajj luraspänwa.

I want no part of what it means.	Kuntï sañ munki ukat janiw mä chikat munkti.
He asked what happened.	Kunas pasäna sasaw jisktʼäna.
He said that he liked it.	Jupajj ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa sasaw säna.
This was clearly in two places.	Ukajj qhanaw pä cheqan utjäna.
And you can repeat it every day.	Ukat sapa uruw ukham wasitat lurasma.
So he agreed to everything.	Ukatwa taqe kunsa iyaw säna.

What is the value of the ? 	¿Kunas ukaxa?
But you have to be willing to do the wrong thing.	Ukampis jan walinak lurañatakejj taqe chuymaw chʼamachasiñama.

But for some reason he didn't understand, he didn't.	Ukampis mä kunatsa janiw amuykänti, janiw amuykänti.

He really wanted to go.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sarañ munäna.
That’s what really left him.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw juparux jaytawayi.

Well, nowhere, really.	Ukhama, janiwa kawkhansa, chiqpachansa.
But he said no more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp arskänti.
I don't say anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns siskti.

He did it very well.	Jupax wali sum luratayna.

Then he started to penetrate me.	Ukat nayaruw mantañ qalltäna.
That’s what he did for a year.	Ukhamaw mä marax luratayna.

But try not to do that.	Ukampis jan ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.

I want that big reach.	Nayax uka jach’a puriñ munta.
Well, it's better than nothing.	Ukhama, jan kuna lurañat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.

But that will happen too.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamarakiw pasani.
He didn't know what that could be.	Ukajj kunas utjaspa uk janiw yatkänti.
He doesn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.

That’s why he did everything.	Ukatwa taqe kunsa luräna.

He thought he went for a ride.	Jupajj autot sarañatakiw saräna sasaw amuyäna.
And that's how it felt.	Ukat ukhamwa jikjjatasïna.
He decided this very carefully.	Ukjja, jupajj wali amuyumpiw amtäna.

Nobody wants to use it.	Janiw khitis uka apnaqañ munkiti.
It's just that.	Ukax ukakiw...

Now you believe it.	Jichhax jumax ukax iyaw satawa.
I did the same thing this past weekend.	Nayax ukhamarakiw aka qhipa semanan lurawayta.
The best way to do this would be to do it on an individual basis.	Uk lurañatakix wali askiwa, sapa mayniw ukham lurañax wakisispa.

But there was nothing more to do.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkänti.
Now that’s not the case.	Jichhax ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Two weeks later, no one did.	Pä semana qhepatjja, janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
Not really beyond him.	Janiw chiqpachansa jupat sipansa.
He wondered what was next.	Ukat kunas jutïrin pasani sasaw jisktʼasïna.

Why why why why.	Kunatsa kunatsa kunatsa kunatsa.
It was rolling its eyes at them.	Ukajj jupanakar nayranakap uñchʼukiskäna.
Maybe you can do that word well.	Inas uka arunak wali sum lurasma.
I had no idea what was going on there.	Kunsa ukan luraskäna uk janiw yatkayätti.
So there is no need to do anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns lurañajj wakiskiti.
I want to know how to do this.	Kunjamsa ukanak lurañ yatiñ munta.
This is a bad night .	Akax mä jan wali arumaw .

I don’t think that’s possible.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykti.

This is the real power.	Akax chiqpach ch’amawa.
Here’s the thing.	Akax kunas.
I have just started.	Jichhakiw qalltawayta.
So someone spoke up.	Ukhamajj mayniw parläna.
Or at night as he put it.	Jan ukajj arumaw kunjamtï siskäna ukhama.
It was quickly discovered.	Ukax jank’akiw jikxatasïna.

Such a strange word.	Ukham muspharkañ aru.
Just like he said.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukhama.

He turned away from it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa kuttʼjjäna.
I know it’s not enough.	Nayax yattwa janiw ukax wakiskiti.
And nobody does that.	Ukat janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.

He was a real nice guy.	Jupajj cheqpach wali suma jaqënwa.
The timing was wonderful, too.	Uka tiempojj wali sumapunïnwa, ukhamaraki.
I can't say when.	Janiw kunapachas uk sañjamäkiti.

And that’s immediate.	Ukat ukax jank’akiw.

And he’s going to need a lot of it.	Ukat jupax walja ukanakaw munasini.

He wanted her with all his mind.	Jupajj taqe amuyumpiw jupar munäna.

Now he could make them very quickly.	Jichhajj jupanakar wali jankʼakiw luraspäna.
Very soon now someone will.	Wali jank’akiw jichhax maynix lurani.
I knew it wasn't what he wanted.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti, uk sum yatiyäta.

That’s not the case, of course.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.

He did not say what it was.	Kuntï ukajj uk janiw siskänti.

There’s a lot of energy out there.	Ukax mä jach’a ch’amaw ukanx utji.

Someone gave it to me.	Mayniw uk churitu.
Of course, it's not very useful.	Chiqansa, janiw wali askïkiti.

Of course, that would be impossible.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax janiw utjkaspati.

But so far nothing has worked.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw kunas askïkiti.

You’re right about it.	Jumax sum amuyta.
It’s very lonely here.	Aka chiqanx wali sapakiw jikxatasi.
No one goes there.	Janiw khitis uka chiqar sarkiti.
They had the basics.	Jupanakajj kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utjäna.

I want to work again.	Nayax wasitat irnaqañ munta.
I didn’t want to do it alone.	Janiw naya sapaki uk lurañ munkayätti.
He was doing what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk luraskäna.
It will get you where you want it.	Kawkhantï munkta ukaruw purini.
But no one really knows everything.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpachapuni taqi kun yatkiti.
Every day.	Sapa uru.
Just this and this.	Ukhama aka ukhamaraki aka.
Here, nobody.	Akax, janiw khitis.
I myself do not know where he lived, or how he lived.	Naya pachpajj kawkhansa jakasïna, jan ukajj kunjamsa jakasïna uk janiw yatkti.
But then he spoke.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jupaw parläna.
He did what he was told.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna uk luräna.
Yes,’ he said.	Jïsa’ sasaw säna.
There was no time limit.	Janiw kuna horasas utjkänti.
I think he has a real future.	Nayax amuyta, jupax chiqpach jutïr pachanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He would never have done that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukanak lurkaspänti.
That is what he preached.	Ukaw jupajj yatiyäna.
Recently he decided to make one himself.	Jichhakiw jupa pachpa mä lurañ amtäna.
He thought it was funny.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyäna.
I really don’t want to.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax munkti.
I think faster than you.	Nayajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp jankʼakiw amuyta.
But they are not like that.	Ukampis janiw jupanakajj ukhamäkiti.
But you have to do it no matter what you decide.	Ukampis kuna amtar purisajj uk lurañamawa.
It’s hard and.	Ukax ch’amawa ukat.
No one could believe it, he thought.	Janiw khitis iyaw sañjamäkiti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I strongly doubt that.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw uka tuqit pächasta.
I mentioned earlier that this year, this is it.	Nayax nayraqat arsuwayta aka marax, akax ukawa.
Everything is going well .	Taqi kunas wali suma saraski .
He’s not going anywhere.	Jupax janiw kawkirus sarkiti.

I’m sorry that’s just not the case.	Nayax llakistwa ukax ukhamakiw jan ukhamäkiti.
Never stop learning, ever.	Janipuniw yatiqañ jaytañamäkiti, janipuniw.
He himself did not understand what he was doing.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kuntï lurkäna uk sum amuykänti.
I’m going to say these words immediately.	Nayax jank’akiw uka arunak arsuñ munta.
I have done this for many years.	Walja maranakaw uk lurawayta.
That was the time.	Ukhamaw uka tiempojj utjäna.

And how long it can take.	Ukat qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasaspa.
It was very, very nice.	Wali, wali sumapunïnwa.
No one works hard.	Janiw khitis wal irnaqkiti.
But I don't know why, but it doesn't work.	Ukampis kunatsa uk janiw yatkti, ukampis janiw irnaqkiti.
But there was nothing about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitxa utjkänti.
Too little, too late.	Sinti juk’a, wali qhipa.
He thinks that’s a good thing.	Jupax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyi.
That’s how things will be.	Ukhamaw kunas utjani.
You’re so worried about me.	Jumax nayat wal llakista.
A really long time.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya tiempo.

Time is of the essence in this regard.	Uka tuqitxa tiempox wali wakiskiriwa.
Not last night, maybe.	Janiw nayra arumax utjkänti, inas.
Then there is three more weeks.	Ukat kimsa semanaw jukʼamp tiempox utji.
No one knew exactly what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkänti.
Anyway, someone did.	Kawkhansa, mayniw ukham luräna.
I said maybe.	Nayax inas sasaw sista.
I left it there for a while.	Ukan mä jukʼa tiempo jaytawayta.
He slept soundly for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj wali sumaw ikiskäna.
I know more than you do.	Nayajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp yattwa.
He knows the food.	Jupax manq’añanak yati.

He only happened once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw pasäna.
He left a few hours ago.	Mä qawqha horanak nayraw sarjjäna.
I didn't know what to make of him.	Nayajj janiw kunsa jupat lurañ yatkayätti.
It was cold and silent there.	Ukanjja, wali thaya ukat amukiw jikjjatasïna.
Too small, too big.	Sinti jisk’a, sinti jach’a.
I would say yes!.	¡Nayax jïsa sañ munta!.
There’s no real food.	Janiw chiqpach manq’añax utjkiti.
I want to eat this.	Nayax aka manq’a manq’añ munta.
I feel very comfortable.	Nayajj wali sumaw jikjjatasta.
A little bit of a slowdown.	Mä juk’a juk’a.
You should never do that.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurañamäkiti.
This was not the case at all.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkänti.
It exists in itself.	Ukax jupa pachpaw utji.

It really should do that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurañapawa.
That is rare for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw sinti utjkiti.
But he is doing just fine.	Ukampis jupajj wali sumwa luraski.
He loved her the most.	Jupaw jupar jukʼamp munasïna.
I think he’s both.	Nayax jupax panpachaniw sasaw amuyta.
But whatever it was.	Ukampis kunas ukajj ukhamänwa.
I planned the next best thing.	Jutïr suma lurañanak amtawayta.
I never understood how he could do that.	Kunjamsa ukham luraspa uk janipuniw amuykayätti.
No one knew who did it.	Khitis uk luratayna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
And it was, he was.	Ukat ukhamänwa, jupajj ukhamänwa.
The man refused to go to the hospital.	Uka jaqix janiw hospitalar sarañ munkänti.
He thought it was now or never.	Jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyäna.
And when you do that, no one understands.	Ukat ukham lurasax janiw khitis amuykiti.
Just try to do it once.	Mä kutikiw ukham lurañatak chʼamachasiñama.
I immediately sensed what might be wrong.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk jankʼakiw amuyasta.
I see it again, now.	Nayax wasitat uñjta, jichhax.
I’m sure he’s right.	Nayax jupax chiqaw sasaw sista.
So tell me the truth.	Ukhamajj kunatï cheqäki uk yatiyapjjeta.
Nothing for you at the moment.	Janiw kunas jumatakix jichha pachanx utjkiti.
Don’t do that!.	¡Janiw uk luramti!.
And he doesn’t want to go with me.	Ukat jupax janiw nayamp chika sarañ munkiti.
We need to do this as soon as possible.	Ukjja jankʼakiw lurañasa.
He never goes anywhere.	Jupajj janipuniw kawkirus sarkiti.
You’ll be the one to feel it.	Jumaw ukham jikxatasïta.
Don’t leave him alone.	Janiw jupar jaytañamäkiti.
You can do a lot on your own.	Jumax sapakiw walpun lurasma.
You’re still in love.	Jumax wali munasiñampiw jikxatastaxa.
There is a box.	Ukaxa kuna.
But that will take time.	Ukampis ukatakix tiempow munasini.
They know exactly what is going on.	Kunas pasaski uk sum yatipxi.
You need to repeat the game.	Uka anattʼañ wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
Several days later, he repeated the words.	Walja urunak qhepatjja, wasitatwa uka arunak arsüna.
The beer is very good.	Cerveza ukaxa wali sumawa.
I think this was it.	Nayax amuyta akax ukhamänwa.
I feel comfortable here.	Nayax akanx wali sum jikxatastxa.
This is more than likely to happen to you.	Ukajj jumat sipansa jukʼampiw pasaspa.
Book after book.	Libro ukat libro.
But it felt surprisingly good.	Ukampis muspharkañ wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
That's what you do.	Ukham lurasajj ukham lurasma.
Perfect for what you want in a cigar.	Kuntï cigarro ukan munkta ukatakix wali askiwa.
And another beautiful day, another beautiful day.	Ukat yaqha suma uru, yaqha suma uru.
I love him and I love him.	Jupar wal munasta ukat jupat walpun munasta.
Now .	Jichha .
No one, he said.	Janiw khitis, sasaw säna.
It's okay that you didn't.	Janiw ukham lurapkta ukajj walikïskiwa.
Better to do it longer next time.	Jutïr kutin jukʼamp tiempo lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
So I understood that.	Ukhamajj uk amuyayäta.
He was doing these things.	Jupajj ukanak luraskäna.
But almost everything is good.	Ukampis niya taqe kunas wali askiwa.
That’s why he loved them so much.	Ukatwa jupanakar wal munasïna.
He was obviously in a hurry.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I told him a bit of the real joke.	Nayax juparux mä juk’a chiqpach chiqaw sista.
And it doesn’t mean anything.	Ukat janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
I heard what you wanted.	Kuntï jumajj munkta uk istʼta.
He did it quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk luräna.
I want to do it.	Nayax lurañ munta.
And try to do it each and every day.	Ukat sapa uru ukat sapa uru lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
Very very bad.	Wali wali jan wali.

That’s how you’re out there.	Ukhamaw jumax ukanx jikxatasïta.
There is only one of these.	Ukanakat mä sapakiw utji.
I really don’t want to talk about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit parlañ munkti.
He was a scientist.	Jupajj khitïnsa.
I just have this.	Nayax ukhamakiw akax utjitu.
I finally did some homework.	Qhepatjja, mä qhawqha tareanak lurawayta.
BACK	QHIPA
Something he felt deep down.	Kunas jupax chuyma manqhan jikxatasïna.
I don't know why he did that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkti.
I think there was a little one.	Nayax amuyta, mä jisk’a ukaw utjäna.
This beer is amazing.	Aka cerveza ukax wali muspharkañawa.
I know you can do better.	Nayax yattwa jumax juk’amp sum lurasma.
He uses a lot of stuff.	Jupax walja yänak apnaqi.
I think everyone knows when it’s time to go.	Nayax amuyta, kunapachas sarañ pachax purini uk taqiniw yatipxi.
Do what he wants you to do.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk lurañamawa.
You don’t want to say that.	Janiw uk sañ munktati.
He did not know what a man was.	Jupajj kunas mä jaqejj uk janiw yatkänti.
The real world is even weirder.	Chiqpach pachax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
Not that it’s impossible.	Janiw ukax jan lurañjamäkiti.
I wasn't sure why.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
What he was doing.	Kuntï jupajj luraskäna.
And don't forget.	Ukat jan armasimti.
He was touched to see them.	Jupanakar uñjasajj chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
It took them a couple of days for that.	Ukatakejj mä pä uruw jupanakajj pasäna.
Eventually, it became clear.	Qhepatjja, qhanaw amuyasïna.
And how to do that.	Ukat kunjamsa ukham lurañasa.
But in many ways it is not.	Ukampis walja toqet janiw ukhamäkiti.
So he spent a lot of time alone.	Ukatwa sapaki walja tiempo sarnaqäna.
I can’t find him.	Janiw jupar jikxatkti.
It’s a great party.	Mä jach’a fiesta.
He decided to take what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk apsuñ amtäna.
And then do it again.	Ukat ukat wasitat lurañamawa.
But he wanted a beer.	Ukampis mä cerveza munäna.
Beautiful and long lasting.	Suma ukat jaya tiempow uñjasi.
I always think so.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham amuyta.
That’s really rare.	Ukax chiqpachansa juk’akiw utji.
Of course that’s the case.	Chiqansa ukax ukhamawa.
It can take years.	Walja maranakaw munasispa.
Once you do, you’ll feel great.	Mä kutix uk lurasax wali sumaw jikxatasïta.
I'm feeling the way I do.	Nayajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta.
There’s always something wrong.	Sapa kutiw kunas jan walïkiti.
I’m going to tell someone.	Nayax khitimpis sista.
I couldn’t do anything that day.	Uka urux janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
Someone like me.	Nayar uñtasit khititix.
I had no reason to.	Janiw kuna razonas ukham lurañajj utjkitänti.
And you can do the same.	Ukat jumax ukhamarakiw lurasma.
There wasn’t, really, anywhere else to go.	Janiw, chiqpachansa, yaqha chiqar sarañax utjkänti.
I’m going to say that.	Nayax ukax sañ munta.
I saw him yesterday.	Nayax juparux qharüruw uñjta.
This happened for no apparent reason.	Ukajj jan kunatsa pasäna.
He knew he didn't.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti uk sum yatïna.

The man is doing well.	Uka jaqejj wali sumwa luraski.
I didn’t expect to see them.	Janiw jupanakar uñjañ suykayätti.
But then he spoke up.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jupajj parläna.
If you want to talk about it.	Uka tuqit parltʼañ munsta ukhaxa.
It’s going great so far.	Jichhakamax wali sumaw saraski.
You do it quietly.	Jumax amukiw uk lurasma.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj ukaruw wal munasi.
A real person would never do that.	Chiqpach jaqix janipuniw ukham lurkaspati.
This is the rest.	Akax qhipharux ukhamawa.
It will come by itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw jutani.
I am, like, happy.	Nayax, ukhama, kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It doesn’t mean a word of that word.	Janiw uka arut mä arunak sañ munkiti.
He had wanted to see her for years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw jupar uñjañ munäna.
He thought that was funny.	Jupajj ukajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyäna.
Maybe he doesn't know about it.	Inas uka toqet jan yatkchiti.
He does these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sumwa luri.
If you do, it would be great.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja, wali askïspawa.
Of course this is wrong.	Chiqansa akax janiw walïkiti.

He sees it for a long time.	Jupax jaya pachaw uñji.
You don’t have to do one.	Janiw mä lurañax wakiskiti.
I really doubt that.	Chiqpachansa ukat pächastwa.
I think this is completely inappropriate.	Nayatakix akax taqpach jan askïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasta.
At the time, he felt something.	Uka tiemponjja, kunsa jikjjatasïna.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Ukanx janiw kunas jan walïkiti.
And, he knew he’d do it soon.	Ukat, jupax jank’akiw uk lurañap yatïna.
But he was a very bad guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali jan wali jaqënwa.
But no one knows what happened next.	Ukampis kunas uka qhepat pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He made a mess again.	Jupajj wasitatwa mä jan waltʼäw luräna.
Well, he is like that.	Ukhama, jupax ukhamawa.
A horrible night, for sure.	Mä axsarkañ arumaw, chiqpachansa.

I hope that’s somewhat useful.	Nayax suyt’twa ukax mä juk’a askiwa.
That’s what made him think.	Ukaw jupar amuyäna.
Let’s see what works for you.	Kunas jumatakix askïspa uk uñjañäni.
Instead, he was very cautious.	Jan ukasti wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He was staring at her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Kind of silly really, but that’s how it turned out.	Mä juk’a loqhe chiqpachansa, ukampis ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
But that was obviously his intention.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw jupajj amtäna.
He felt comfortable.	Jupajj sum jikjjatasïna.
So that’s you .	Ukhamajj ukajj jumaruw .
This one is a bit more difficult.	Akax mä juk’a ch’amawa.
I don't remember why.	Kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw amtaskti.
So he couldn't do it.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurkaspänti.
I did what I wanted to do.	Nayajj kuntï lurañ munkta uk lurayäta.
Not the guy .	Janiw uka waynax .
I don’t understand the money.	Nayax janiw qullqix amuykti.
Not much here.	Janiw sinti akanx utjkiti.
It was a man like him.	Ukajj jupar uñtasit jaqënwa.
He was constantly shaking.	Jupajj sapa kutiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
He wasn't in bed.	Janiw jupajj ikiñan utjkänti.

It’s big and unusual.	Ukax jach’a ukat jan uñt’atawa.
And I’m the same.	Ukat nayax ukhamarakiw.
But nowhere else is that possible.	Ukampis janiw kawkhansa ukham lurañajj utjkiti.

It’s very, very simple, and that’s the beauty of it.	Wali, wali ch’amawa, ukat ukax wali sumawa.
Now he was very happy.	Jichhajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I told myself this would pass.	Naya pachpaw akax pasani sasaw sista.
Because, because, because.	Kunatix, kunatix, kunatix.
He was uncomfortable with this.	Jupajj aka toqetwa jan sum jikjjatasïna.
He wants her to be.	Jupajj jupar muni.
Very nice slices.	Wali suma ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But that is very rare.	Ukampis ukajj wali jukʼakiw utji.
He had just bought the place.	Jupajj jichhakiw uka cheq alasïna.

And so it is every day.	Ukat ukhamarakiw sapa uru.
And he doesn't make that big of a deal.	Ukat jupax janiw ukham jachʼa lurkiti.
Too high or too low.	Sinti jach’a jan ukax sinti jisk’a.
I’ve seen this many times.	Nayax walja kutiw aka uñjta.
And he realized that it didn't matter.	Ukat ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw amuyasïna.
Of course, it happened pretty quickly.	Chiqansa, ukax wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
In fact, it really does exist.	Chiqansa, chiqpachapuniw utji.
Do everything you can.	Taqi kunatix lurañjamäki ukanak lurañamawa.

He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukham luräna.
Well, maybe a little more.	Ukhama, inas mä juk’a juk’ampi.
He wants to do it.	Jupax lurañ muni.
It happened in the past.	Nayrajj ukham pasäna.
Now, he asked himself.	Jichhajj sasaw jisktʼasïna.
At the time, it was not clear.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw sum amuyaskänti.
She was afraid of what would happen.	Ukham lurasajj kunas pasani sasaw jupajj ajjsaräna.
It doesn’t exist in one place.	Janiw mä cheqan utjkiti.
Now that’s not a bad thing.	Jichhax janiw ukax jan walïkiti.

One thing is for sure.	Mä kunaw chiqpachapuni utji.
He wondered how that was handled.	Kunjamsa ukajj uñjasi sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Yes, you can really only do what you can really do.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa kuntï chiqpachapuni lurañjamäki ukakiw lurasma.

Something that hasn’t been possible in the past.	Kunatix nayra pachanx jan lurañjamäki ukawa.
And maybe .	Ukat inas .
In fact, he loved himself.	Chiqansa, jupa pachpaw munasïna.

He always refuses.	Jupax sapa kutiw jan munkiti.

Or he wondered why it was okay.	Jan ukajj kunatsa walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But something was very, very wrong.	Ukampis kunas wali, wali jan waliw utjäna.

Someone is in the room with me.	Mayniw nayamp chika cuarto manqhan utji.
Many snowflakes.	Walja ch’uqi.
That was not the case today.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.

He also knows how to gamble.	Jupax qullqi tuqit anattʼañ tuqitsa sum yati.

I think that’s pretty amazing.	Nayatakix ukax wali muspharkañawa.
In fact, I love him.	Chiqansa, juparux walpun munasta.
But that takes longer.	Ukampis ukatakix jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
But it felt good, almost immediately.	Ukampis wali sumwa jikjjatasïna, niya jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
He arrived early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwaw uka cheqar purinïna.
I almost love him so much.	Niya juparux walpun munasta.
That’s good, not bad.	Ukax wali askiwa, janiw jan walïkiti.

And besides, he was right.	Ukat ukat sipansa, chiqaw sasaw säna.

There was no time today.	Jichhürunakanx janiw kuna pachas utjkänti.

It seemed impossible, but it moved much faster.	Ukajj janis lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa, ukampis jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
No one knew how long it would last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
For me, that’s first thing in the morning.	Nayatakix ukax nayrïr kunaw alwax.

If you can afford it, great.	Uka qullqix utjaspa ukhaxa, wali sumawa.

The reason why this is so good is simple.	Kunatsa akax wali askïspa ukax wali ch’amawa.
Today, it is no different.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
Today was a lot of fun.	Jichhürojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
About a year later, we went our separate ways.	Niya mä mara qhepatjja, sapa mayniw sarapjjta.
That’s where it comes from.	Ukax ukaruw puri.
But fortunately, it doesn’t.	Ukampis wali askiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti.

All in all, a good day.	Taqi kunat sipansa, mä suma uru.

He wanted to know, too.	Jupax yatiñ munäna, ukhamaraki.

He was that special to me.	Jupajj ukham nayatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.
Or at least cold.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa thaya.
But he couldn’t leave yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax sarxañ puedkänti.
He decided to do just that.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa amtäna.

He found out what had happened later.	Kunatï paskäna uk qhepatwa yatïna.

I hope this is not the case.	Nayax suyt’twa akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think so today.	Jichhürunakanxa ukhamarakiw amuyta.
Because one can’t do it alone.	Kunatix maynix janiw sapakix lurkaspati.
It was realistic.	Chiqpach ukhamänwa.

This is always a good thing.	Ukax sapa kutiw wali askïspa.

He threw them away immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupanakar jaqontäna.

Now you know everything about me.	Jichhajj jumajj taqe kunwa nayat yatta.

But, really, that doesn’t matter.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Later, he was saying.	Qhepatjja, akham sasaw siskäna.
He didn’t want to go in, he didn’t want to go in at all.	Jupax janiw mantañ munkänti, janiw kunjamatsa mantañ munkänti.
I don't need help with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw yanaptʼa munkti.
There are always worse people, always.	Sapa kutiw juk’amp jan wali jaqinakax utji, sapa kutiw utji.
But this has to be done with caution.	Ukampis ukajj wali amuyumpiw lurañapa.
Not everything is a big deal.	Janiw taqi kunas mä jach’a lurañjamäkiti.
Nobody wanted to work with him.	Janiw khitis jupamp irnaqañ munkänti.
And that doesn’t work.	Ukat ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
He knew this fact.	Jupajj aka cheq yatïna.
It’s kind of nice looking.	Ukax mä juk’a suma uñnaqaniwa.

Do you think it’s worth it?.	Jumax amuyta ukax wali askiwa?.
He didn't seem too bad.	Jupajj janiw sinti jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamäkänti.
But he was very uncomfortable.	Ukampis jupajj wali jan sumwa jikjjatasïna.
The house looks great.	Uka utax wali suma uñtatawa.

Of course, I didn’t.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurkti.

She looked at them again.	Ukat wasitatwa jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
It’s better for me, actually.	Nayatakix juk’amp askiwa, chiqpachansa.

We need to do something quickly.	Kunas jankʼakiw lurañasa.
And he’s always gone.	Ukat jupax sapa kutiw sarxi.
That’s what baseball is.	Ukhamaw béisbol ukax utji.
I doubt anyone did anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkänti sasaw pächasta.

But that is not such a bad thing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukham jan walïkiti.

It doesn’t matter, anyhow.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, kunjamatsa.

Of course, you will be busy.	Chiqansa, jumax jan tiemponiw jikxatasïta.

I don’t think that’s possible, not yet.	Nayax janiw ukax utjkaspati, janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
It can still be good for you.	Wali sumaw jumatakix askïspa.
Something needs to be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañaw wakisi.
I am very grateful to them.	Jupanakar wal yuspärta.
So let's look at that.	Ukhamajj uka toqet uñjañäni.
But he could do something about it.	Ukampis jupajj uka toqet kuns luraspänwa.
He feels lonely.	Jupajj sapakiw jikjjatasi.
He asked me seriously.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw jiskt’itu.
There was plenty of time, plenty of time.	Uka tiemponjja, walja tiempow utjäna, walja tiempow utjäna.
It also looks great.	Ukhamaraki wali suma uñtatawa.
He was a beautiful man.	Mä suma jaqënwa.
No, he didn't want one, he said.	Janiwa, janiw mä munkänti, sasaw säna.
It takes almost no time.	Niya janiw kuna tiempos munaskiti.
He’s, like, in love with me.	Jupax, ukhama, nayamp munasiñampiw jikxatasi.
Or it was quieter.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp amukiw utjäna.
He feels amazing.	Jupajj muspharkañ jikjjatasi.
I don’t make any money.	Nayax janiw qullqi jikxatkti.
I’m really excited!.	¡Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa!.
We must act quickly.	Jankʼakiw lurañasa.
Both are doable.	Panpachaniw lurañjamäkiti.
There is work to be done tomorrow.	Qhipürux lurañaw utji.
He loved her, loved her.	Juparux juparux walpun munäna, walpun munäna.
He said that he was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa sasaw säna.
He walked around a lot.	Jupajj walpun sarnaqäna.
I didn't want to get involved.	Nayajj janiw ukar mantañ munkayätti.
Everything is fine .	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa .
He probably never would have.	Inas janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.

He appreciated it very much.	Jupajj walpun uk wali askit uñjäna.
He doesn't like it.	Jupajj janiw gustkiti.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis yatkayätti.
It’s just too fast.	Ukax jank’akiw wali jaya.
But listening to .	Ukampis istʼasajj .
I saw them today.	Jichhüruw jupanakar uñjta.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkayätti.
Now I want to make that unique.	Jichhax nayax ukax jan uñt’at lurañ munta.
Book, book, book.	Libro, libro, libro.
But that doesn't work for me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
I haven’t seen much from him.	Janiw jupat wal uñjkti.
He wondered if that was right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼasïna.
There is nothing more you can do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañjamäkiti.
But never at the moment.	Ukampis janipuniw jichha tiemponjja.
He died in the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jiwjjäna.
Baseball is funny, to me at least.	Béisbol ukax wali muspharkañawa, nayatakix mä juk’a.
I didn't do anything more than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp kuns lurkti.
I thought you were interesting.	Nayax jumarux wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.

Maybe a day.	Inas mä uru.
I was very clear about it.	Nayajj wali qhanaw amuyayäta.
That will do all of this.	Ukaw taqi ukanak lurani.
I don’t want to talk about him again.	Janiw mayampsa jupat parlañ munkti.
Well he was like that.	Suma jupax ukhamänwa.
There he spent the night.	Ukaruw arumax saräna.
Now that’s real hard!.	Jichhax ukax chiqpach ch’amawa!.
I’m feeling extremely disappointed.	Nayax sinti llakitaw jikxatastxa.
But that was not the case, and he was very careful.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
Still, he sat back down.	Wali chʼamampiw wasitat qontʼasïna.
Financially, of course.	Qullqi tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

I feel better, actually.	Nayax wali sum jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
It seemed like no one else could.	Janis khitis yaqha ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
But that was not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So first day yesterday .	Ukhamajj nayrïr uruw qharüru .
But when he did so.	Ukampis ukham luräna ukhajja.
Everything is available.	Taqi kunas jikxatasi.
It’s too soon for that.	Ukatakix wali jank’akiw.

Finally the big day came.	Qhipharux jach’a uruw purinïna.
Now he’s determined to live a better life.	Jichhax jupax juk’amp suma jakañ amtawayi.
Actually, it was pretty good for me.	Chiqansa, nayatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
He accepted the challenge with caution.	Wali amuyumpiw uka jan walinak katoqäna.
I think so, and I hope so.	Nayax ukhamaw amuyta, ukat ukhamarakiw suyt’askta.
And the facts are obvious.	Ukat kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanaw uñjasi.
But in doing so, he misuses the term.	Ukampis uk lurasajj uka arunak jan sum apnaqi.
So yeah, he did steal it.	Ukhamajj jïsa, jupajj cheqapuniw lunthatasïna.
Here’s how it goes.	Akax kunjams saraski uk uñjañäni.
He needs no more, no less.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp munaskiti, janiw jukʼamp munaskiti.
He was a game man.	Jupajj anattʼañ jaqënwa.
There’s something about that money.	Uka qullqi tuqitxa kunas utji.

Of course, this was rare.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw sinti utjkänti.

Everything feels wrong, it doesn’t work well for me.	Taqi kunas jan waliw jikxatasi, janiw nayatakix sum irnaqkiti.

You understand all of this.	Jumax taqi ukanak sum amuyta.

You may want to use it yourself.	Inas juma pachpa apnaqañ munsta.

That doesn't mean you should never give up.	Ukajj janiw janipuniw jaytañamäkiti sañ munkiti.
He was half asleep, half asleep.	Jupax chikat ikiskäna, chikat ikiskäna.

There was nothing wrong with it.	Janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas utjkänti.

And then he was asleep.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ikiskäna.
He can't do that to me.	Jupajj janiw nayarojj ukham lurkaspati.
He lives here.	Jupax aka chiqan jakasi.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Jan walinak lurañax janiw kun lurañjamäkiti.
He wasn't sure what time it would arrive.	Kuna horasas purini uk janiw sum amuykänti.
This takes two days.	Ukatakix pä uruw munasispa.
You know they know this stuff.	Jumax yatisktawa jupanakax aka yänak yatipxi.

But the reality was that this was not the case.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
It was not a job he really wanted to do.	Ukajj janiw mä trabajo lurañ wal munkänti.
It will happen to me soon.	Nayarojj jankʼakiw pasani.
He rushed to do what he did.	Kuntï lurkäna uk lurañatakiw jankʼak saräna.
He doesn't always do that.	Jupajj janiw sapa kuti ukham lurkiti.
I can't agree with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
No, it’s not himself.	Janiwa, jupa pachpaw.
Soft and warm.	Llamp’u ukat junt’u.
I strongly think it doesn’t.	Nayax wal amuyta janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t want anything from him.	Janiw jupat kuns munkayätti.
Yeah, very happy, of course.	Jïsa, wali kusisitaw, chiqpachansa.
Now that means something.	Jichhax ukax mä kuns sañ muni.
Yes, it was, of course.	Jïsa, ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
I’ve left everyone behind.	Nayax taqiniruw jaytawayta.
It’s an important night.	Mä wakiskir arumaw.
That means a happier you!.	Ukax mä juk’amp kusisit jumax sañ muni!.
I feel more excited.	Jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I don't like it that much.	Nayajj janiw ukham sinti gustkituti.
She said she didn’t need a man.	Jupax janiw mä chachax munaskiti sasaw säna.
These are strictly avoidable.	Ukanakax wali ch’amampiw jan lurañama.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa sum yatkänti.
So it gets worse.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp jan waliw uñjasi.
One or two more.	Mä jan ukax pä juk’ampi.
But there is a slightly better way to do it.	Ukampis mä jukʼa jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
That wasn't what he meant.	Ukajj janiw jupajj sañ munkänti.
There’s nothing inside me.	Janiw kunas nayan manqhan utjkiti.
But I haven’t seen anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis uñjkti.
I don't believe anything.	Janiw kuns iyaw siskti.
He remained alert.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw qheparäna.
Much bigger than I ever imagined.	Kuntï amuykayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa.
You shouldn’t do that at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurañamäkiti.
Only one did it.	Mä sapakiw uk luräna.
I always want the impossible.	Nayax sapa kutiw jan lurañjamäki ukanak munta.
Yes, he can do that.	Jïsa, jupajj ukham luraspawa.
People are like that.	Jaqinakax ukhamawa.
But that doesn't make sense of the issue.	Ukampis ukajj uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw kunäkisa.
There can be nothing else.	Janiw yaqha kunas utjkaspati.
He needed more blood work.	Jupajj jukʼamp wila lurañaw wakisïna.
Now he didn't do that.	Jichhajj janiw uk lurkänti.
I have noticed this many times.	Ukjja walja kutiw amuyasta.
But not everything is possible.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas utjkaspati.
It wasn’t anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans utjkänti.
I can’t remember why, really.	Kunatsa uk janiw amtaskti, chiqpachansa.
Or two, if necessary.	Jan ukax pä, wakisispa ukhaxa.
That should do it, he thought.	Ukaw lurañapa, sasaw amuyäna.
I know that time is of the essence.	Nayax yattwa, tiempox wali wakiskiriwa.
It gets weirder and weirder.	Ukax juk’amp muspharkañ juk’amp muspharkañawa.
He asked me to marry him.	Jupampiw casarasiñatak mayïtu.
Something happened to me.	Kunas nayarojj pasäna.
Those people need to be rebuilt .	Uka jaqinakax wasitat lurañaw wakisi .
He said that was fine with me.	Ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
I never said that to him.	Janipuniw jupar ukham siskti.
Of course, it didn't matter.	Chiqansa, janiw ukax wakiskänti.
You want more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munasma.
I have no idea what you mean.	Nayax janiw kuntix jumax sañ munkta ukx amuykti.
But then he always refused.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, sapa kutiw jan munkänti.
I know that happened.	Ukajj pasäna uk nayajj yattwa.
But he readily agreed.	Ukampis jupajj jankʼakiw uk iyaw säna.
Nothing is ever right.	Janiw kunas janipuniw walïkiti.
You know what to do, just do it.	Jumax yatisktawa kuns lurañama, ukhamakiw lurañama.
Also, who is the least likely to be right.	Ukhamaraki, khititix juk’amp jisk’a chiqaw sañ muni.
I don’t want to make too much of it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit sinti lurañ munkti.
No one understands this.	Janiw khitis uk amuykiti.
He spoke the truth.	Jupajj cheqapuniw parläna.
Thank you very much indeed.	Chiqpachansa wal yuspärta.
The snow is called.	Ukax satawa.
I think it’s going to be pretty good.	Nayax amuyta, wali sumaw utjani.
There is a lot of light here.	Aka chiqanx wali qhanaw utji.
They don’t know any better.	Jupanakax janiw juk’amp sum yatipkiti.
He obviously didn't know what we were doing.	Jupajj qhanaw kuntï lurapkta uk janiw yatkänti.
But after what I've done, it's hard.	Ukampis kuntï lurawaykta uka qhepatjja, chʼamakiwa.
I think this is fun.	Nayax amuyta akax kusiskañawa.
He didn't want to let this opportunity pass him by.	Jupajj janiw uka oportunidad pasañap munkänti.
No one knows where he went or why.	Kawkirus saräna, kunatsa saräna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But what he said never mattered.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna ukajj janipuniw kunäkisa.
Thank you always.	Sapa kutiw yuspärta.
He is a great guy.	Jupajj mä jachʼa jaqewa.
So it’s all worth it.	Ukhamajj taqe kunas wali askiwa.
And that’s what you want to do.	Ukat ukax kuntix jumax lurañ munkta ukawa.
He’s very famous and alone.	Jupax wali uñt’atawa ukat sapakiw.
A small amount of snowflakes.	Mä jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But that is obvious.	Ukampis ukajj qhanawa.
Now he was surprised.	Jichhajj jupajj wal muspharäna.
After that, it was.	Uka qhepatjja, ukhamänwa.
I think he needs both.	Nayax amuyta, jupax panpachaniw munasispa.
That seems like a good character.	Ukajj mä suma jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
You are alone .	Jumax sapakiw jikxatastaxa .
It would be nice to go for a few days.	Mä qawqha urunak sarañax wali askïspawa.
He said that would be the best.	Ukaw wali askïspa sasaw säna.

And that’s exactly what it is.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
All the snowflakes.	Taqi uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He understood the danger.	Jupajj uka jan walinak amuyasïna.
He spent the night in bed.	Jupajj uka arumaw ikiñan qheparäna.
Maybe not much though.	Inas jan sinti ukampis.

But they are nothing.	Ukampis jupanakajj janiw kunäkisa.
How everything happens to you.	Kunjamsa taqe kunas jumar pasaspa.
I love making things.	Nayax yänak lurañ walpun munta.
I never got that chance.	Janipuniw uka chʼam jikxatkti.
He saw something in me.	Jupajj nayan kunsa uñjäna.
It took a long time.	Ukajj mä jachʼa tiempow munasïna.
He loved it all so much.	Jupajj taqe ukanak wal munasïna.
He didn't say anything.	Janiw kuns siskänti.
He gave them all the words.	Jupajj taqeniw arunak churäna.
He saw something more.	Jupajj jukʼamp kunsa uñjäna.
Interestingly, no one knows anything.	Wali muspharkañawa, janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.
It did and it worked.	Ukham luratayna ukat wali askiwa.
But that meant no more than that.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkänti.
Most important of all.	Taqi kunat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
But there is one last thing.	Ukampis mä qhep qhepa kunaw utji.
No breakfast today.	Jichhürunakanx janiw desayuno ukax utjkiti.

Why people like it so much.	Kunatsa jaqenakajj wal gusti.

I was very disappointed but it was worth it.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta ukampis ukax wali askiwa.
I didn’t find a great one.	Janiw mä jach’a jikxatkti.
It’s going to be a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw pasani.
That’s what happened this time.	Ukhamaw aka kutin pasäna.
It looks real.	Chiqpach uñtatawa.
He decided to go home early.	Jupajj nayraw utar sarañ amtäna.
He doesn’t understand what it is.	Jupax janiw kunas uk amuykiti.
What could be better than that?.	¿Kunas ukat sipansa jukʼamp askïspa?.
No one knows anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet kuns yatkiti.
These are the things that are needed now.	Ukanakaw jichhax wakisi.
He was going all out and everything was happening like that.	Jupax taqi ch’amampiw sarnaqäna ukat taqi kunas ukham luraskäna.
I personally like it.	Naya pachpaw ukajj gustitu.
He wanted to get out.	Jupax mistuñ munäna.

He’s excited about it.	Jupax uka tuqit kusisitaw jikxatasi.
Not unless you want it.	Janiwa jan ukasti jumax munkta ukhama.
There are three parts.	Kimsa chiqaw utji.

Why, this is a wonderful man.	Kunatsa, akax wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
It was the only one he knew well.	Ukajj mä sapakiw jupajj sum yatïna.
No, it wasn’t.	Janiwa, wali sumawa.
It was, as usual, empty.	Ukanjja, kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, janiw khitis utjkänti.

Something struck me.	Kunas nayarojj amuyasïna.

There was no reason at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
Well, it felt pretty bad.	Ukhama, wali jan waliw jikxatasïna.
He didn't want any trouble.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis munkänti.
He loves to play.	Jupajj anattʼañ wal muni.
But, it doesn’t do that.	Ukampis, janiw uk lurkiti.
I see that in him.	Uk jupat uñjta.
And you need to do it quickly.	Ukat jankʼakiw uk lurañama.
This seems a little silly.	Akax mä juk’a llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
He came here to do the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañatakiw akan jutäna.
No one seems to know what that could be.	Ukajj kunas utjaspa uk janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamawa.
I think he would have done it.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa sasaw amuyta.
That was all there was, really.	Ukaw taqpach utjäna, chiqpachansa.
Of course, everything is good.	Chiqansa, taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He felt helpless.	Jupajj jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I wonder how.	Kunjamsa sasaw jisktʼasta.
The same is true of it.	Ukhamarakiw uka tuqitxa.
He says it all the time.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham siski.
And he was doing very well.	Ukat wali sumwa luraskäna.
He just went for it, and very quickly.	Jupax ukatakix ukhamakiw saräna, ukat wali jank’akiw saräna.
But I never really liked it.	Ukampis janipuniw chiqpachapunix gustkituti.
So he spoke to himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa arsüna.
He will do it for me.	Jupaw nayatak uk lurani.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
I know it will do the same for you.	Nayax yattwa jumatakix ukhamarakiw lurani.
And there's no reason why it can't.	Ukat janiw kuna razonas utjkiti, kunatsa jan ukham lurañjamäki.
It should do everything you want it to do.	Taqi kuntï munkta uk lurañapawa.
That's all you remember.	Ukakiw jumajj amtaskta.
He wants to do it with love.	Munasiñampiw lurañ munaraki.
But it never did that for me.	Ukampis janipuniw nayatakejj ukham lurkänti.
Still alone in his room.	Wali jach’a utapan sapakiw jikxatasïna.
He arrived a few days early.	Jupax mä qawqha urunak nayraw purinïna.
But at the time, it looked good.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, wali sumaw uñnaqäna.
You’ve got me there.	Jumax nayaruw ukan jikxatasïta.

We'll do something about it later.	Qhipürux uka tuqit kuns lurañäni.

The person really needs to do that.	Chiqpachansa, uka jaqix ukham lurañaw wakisi.
That happened to me.	Ukajj nayaruw pasäna.
But he didn't know much about it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uka toqet sinti sum yatkänti.
But I don't think that matters to me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
He thought he was worried.	Jupax llakitaw sasaw amuyäna.
Don’t do this and do that.	Janiw uk luramti ukat ukham luramti.
The snowflake is the snowflake.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
And yes, we need to act quickly.	Ukat jïsa, jankʼakiw kuns lurañasa.
He was the best person that ever happened to me.	Jupaw kunatï nayatak paskäna ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp suma jaqënwa.
Many times this is not the case.	Walja kutiw ukajj jan walïkiti.
But he didn't want me.	Ukampis janiw nayar munkänti.
You can still do everything.	Taqi kuns wali chʼamampiw lurasma.
I’ll say this again.	Nayax wasitat akham sañ munta.

I need to do something else.	Nayax yaqha lurañaw wakisi.
Yeah, it’s more fun here.	Jïsa, akanx juk’amp kusiskañawa.
He doesn’t go to school with you.	Janiw jumamp chika yatiqañ utar sarkiti.
Money can’t do that.	Qullqix janiw uk lurkaspati.
But that can't last much longer.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati.
He said he knew it would happen sooner or later.	Jupax jank’akiw jan ukax qhipürux ukham lurasiñap yattwa sasaw säna.
Home, she decided.	Uta, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
But I’m the only one.	Ukampis naya sapakiw.
He spoke to her quietly.	Jupajj amukiw jupamp parläna.
The snowflakes are snowflakes.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Not me, he meant, never me.	Janiw nayax, jupax sañ munäna, janipuniw nayax.
Avoid everything about it.	Uka tuqitxa taqi kunsa janiw lurañamäkiti.
The man was already gone.	Uka jaqejj niyaw sarjjäna.
He has both, which is nice.	Jupax panpachaniw utji, ukax wali sumawa.
I feel good about that time.	Nayax uka pachanx wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
Currently, money is tight.	Jichha pachanx qullqix ch’amawa.
He laid back down on the bed.	Jupajj wasitatwa ikiñar qontʼasïna.
I don’t know how or why.	Kunjamsa ukat kunatsa uk janiw yatkti.
You have to make an effort to do so.	Ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
And that’s not good for anyone.	Ukat ukax janiw khitirus askïkiti.
He was right about that.	Jupajj uka toqet cheq parläna.
Where it came from, he couldn't say exactly.	Kawkitsa jutäna, janiw sum siskänti.

Because he’s been there with me.	Kunatix jupax nayamp chikaw ukan jikxatasïna.

But it seemed doable.	Ukampis ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
There are always new people.	Sapa kutiw machaq jaqinakax utji.

Of course, that is not the case now.	Chiqansa, jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Well, they were pretty good.	Ukhama, jupanakax wali sumapunïnwa.
Didn't like it very much.	Janiw sinti gustkänti.

I could tell he didn't want to talk here.	Janiw akan parlañ munkänti, uk sum amuyayäta.
But no one wants to talk about it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uka tuqit parlañ munkiti.
Looks like this is it.	Uñnaqaniwa akax ukhamawa.

Well that’s all good then.	Suma ukax taqpach wali askiwa ukat.

Why did this happen.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna.
Or act quickly.	Jan ukajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañama.

He knows where it is.	Jupax kawkhans uk yati.
He seemed kind of upbeat.	Jupajj mä jukʼa suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.

I don’t think it’s worth it.	Nayax janiw askïkiti.
That is the question you asked.	Uka jisktʼajj jumaw jisktʼasta.

But you feel the same way.	Ukampis jumax ukhamarakiw amuyasta.
It always has and always will.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurawayta ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
But then he didn't say anything.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw jupajj arskänti.
Maybe you can do something.	Inas mä kun lurasma.
I mean it’s great.	Nayax wali jach’a sañ munta.
Or, something like that.	Jan ukax, kunas ukham uñt’atawa.

He’s a little too excited.	Jupax mä juk’a sinti kusisitaw jikxatasi.
So he sat there.	Ukatwa jupajj ukan qontʼasïna.
It did no more than that.	Ukajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
It feels like that.	Ukajj ukham jikjjatasi.
He had one last thing to do.	Jupajj mä qhep qhepa lurañaw utjäna.
Something worked, he thought.	Kunas irnaqäna, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
You’re a nice guy.	Jumax mä suma waynawa.

Enjoy the day so much.	Uka urux wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.

You can’t really do that.	Janiw chiqpachapunix ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Very reluctantly he does it.	Wali jan munasiñampiw jupax uk lurañ yati.
He said something to himself.	Jupa pachpaw mä kuns arsüna.

But he was silent.	Ukampis jupax amukiw jikxatasïna.

He looked pleased with himself.	Jupa pachpaw kusisit uñnaqäna.

He started early.	Jupajj nayraw qalltäna.
He decided to find out.	Jupajj yatiñwa amtäna.
There was no more time.	Janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkänti.
They’re pretty maybe.	Jupanakax wali sumaw inas.
Where is the bigger.	Kawkhans juk’amp jach’a.

Weird, but fun.	Muspharkañawa, ukampis kusiskañawa.
I really don't know what the problem was.	Chiqpachansa kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Do you want to?.	¿Jumaxa munasmati?.
Where did he get this stuff? 	¿Kawkitsa uka yänak apsüna?
Day by day, year by year.	Uru uru, mara mara.
There was no reason to do so.	Ukham lurañatakix janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
It's not something I can do in the future.	Janiw jutïrin mä jukʼa lurañjamäkiti.
It’s very difficult, actually.	Wali ch’amawa, chiqpachansa.

Well, otherwise, so.	Ukhama, yaqha, ukhama.

Something is wrong, not right.	Kunas janiw walïkiti, janiw walïkiti.

A lot can happen to the brand.	Walja kunaw uka markarux pasaspa.

You can do something like that at a party.	Ukham mä fiestan kuns lurasma.
I’ve seen some of this stuff.	Nayax mä qawqha aka yänak uñjta.
He’s given up.	Jupax jaytawayi.

Or is that enough.	Jan ukajj ¿ukajj wakisispati.
I am the only one who feels uncomfortable.	Naya sapakiw jan walin jikjjatasta.

Of course he wanted one.	Chiqansa jupax mä munäna.
No way, really.	Janiw kunjamatsa, chiqpachansa.
You just want it.	Jumax sapakiw munta.
He could do things himself.	Jupa pachpaw kuns luraspäna.
Someone walked over there.	Mayniw uka chiqar sarnaqäna.

And so it happened, of course.	Ukat ukhamaw pasäna, chiqpachansa.

He hadn't slept in a while, she thought.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jan ikiskäna sasaw jupajj amuyäna.

And he’s still with me.	Ukat jupax nayamp chikaw wali sarnaqaski.

That’s what.	Ukax kuna.

You do everything on your own.	Jumax taqi kuns sapakiw lurasma.

He said quietly.	Amukiw sasaw säna.

I personally don't really like it.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukajj cheqpachapun gustkituti.

But not the other way around.	Ukampis janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
And I don’t need it.	Ukat nayatakix janiw wakiskiti.
But it really happened this week.	Ukampis cheqapuniw aka semanan pasäna.
But it doesn’t really have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He said it only once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw uk säna.

I don't like doing nothing.	Jan kun lurañajj janiw nayatakejj gustkituti.

He doesn't really mean it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun uk sañ munkiti.
And he understood why.	Ukat kunatsa uk amuyasïna.
I was immediately surprised.	Nayajj jankʼakiw muspharta.
No, there’s no time for it.	Janiwa, janiw kuna pachas ukanak lurañatakix utjkiti.
It’s the only thing you need, of course.	Ukax sapa mayniw munasispa, chiqpachansa.
Do what you want, when you want.	Kuntï munkta uk luram, kunapachatï munkta ukhaxa.
He’s all alone.	Jupax taqpach sapakiw jikxatasi.
Fortunately, we never have to.	Wali askiwa, janipuniw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
But it’s definitely something else.	Ukampis chiqpachapuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
No, maybe as much as he deserves.	Janiw, inas kunjamtï jupajj wakiski ukhama.
He was a little early.	Jupax mä juk’a nayraw jikxatasïna.

I didn’t want to draw too much blood.	Janiw sinti wila apsuñ munkayätti.
To my surprise, he agreed.	Jupajj iyaw sänwa, ukajj wal muspharta.
But that seemed almost impossible.	Ukampis ukajj niya jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Today, that would be no problem.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
So something else had to be done.	Ukhamajj yaqha lurañaw wakisïna.
At the time, this seemed like a good idea.	Uka tiemponjja, ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
And he did nothing more.	Ukat janiw kunas jukʼamp lurkänti.
Actually, it said this.	Chiqpachansa, ukax akham sänwa.
He wondered what time he would arrive.	Kuna horasas purini sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He’s a car man.	Jupax auto jaqiwa.
So he repeated it again.	Ukatwa wasitat arsüna.
So it's obviously not here.	Ukhamajj janiw aka cheqan utjkiti, ukajj qhanawa.

At the time, he wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Uka tiemponjja, kunsa lurani uk janiw sum yatkänti.

But that was never the case.	Ukampis ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
Which is exactly why he didn’t tell her.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunatsa jupax jan jupar yatiyäna.

There is no one thing to do.	Janiw mä kuna lurañas utjkiti.
That obviously happened this time.	Ukajj qhanaw aka kutin pasäna.
I want to take it all.	Nayax taqi ukanak apsuñ munta.
If you want to go underground.	Jumax jamasat sarañ munsta ukhaxa.
I promised someone else.	Nayax yaqha jaqiruw arsuwayta.
I’m going to tell you.	Nayax yatiyätwa.
We rushed to his place.	Jupan utjki ukaruw jankʼak sarapjjta.
And for a while.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempo.
That’s okay though.	Ukax walikïskiwa ukampis.
It gave him a chance.	Ukax juparux mä ch’am churäna.
But one day it will get there.	Ukampis mä urux ukaruw purini.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Janiw kuns lurañ munkayätti.
What am I going to do? 	¿Kunsa nayajj lurä?
I’m so sorry .	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa .
I know people are weird.	Nayax yattwa jaqinakax muspharkañawa.
That would be nice, but it is not.	Ukajj wali askïspawa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
If you want to drive them.	Jumatix jupanakar autot sarañ munsta ukhaxa.
He wants one too.	Jupax mä munaraki.
These things always seem to happen at the wrong time.	Ukanakax sapa kutiw jan wali tiempon pasaspa ukhama.
And that will always be in the wrong place.	Ukat ukax sapa kutiw jan wali chiqan utjani.
Nobody wants to live there.	Janiw khitis ukan jakañ munkiti.
I did something really bad.	Chiqpachansa jan walinak lurawayta.
Maybe a book.	Inas mä libro.
He went above and beyond to impersonate her.	Jupajj jupar uñtasit lurañatakejj jukʼampiw sarnaqäna.
But it happens so many times.	Ukampis ukham walja kutiw pasaspa.
It’s a bad warm year.	Jan wali junt’u mara.
So much, very good.	Ukhama walja, wali suma.
So that's what he said.	Ukhamajj ukham sänwa.
Something said I was a bad person.	Kunas jan wali jaqïtwa sasaw säna.
And you don’t want to know.	Ukat jumax janiw yatiñ munktati.
I haven’t seen him do that.	Janiw ukham lurir uñjkti.
I think that’s what he means.	Nayax amuyta, ukax kuntix jupax sañ munki ukawa.
I can get through it quickly.	Nayajj jankʼakiw uka toqet pasaspa.
They didn’t have that before.	Jupanakax janiw nayrax ukham utjkänti.
He understood her well.	Jupajj sumwa jupar sum amuyäna.
The taxi is waiting for him.	Taxi ukax jupar suyt’aski.
I don't remember exactly how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum amtaskti.
It’s much, much faster.	Ukax juk’amp, juk’amp jank’akiw.
Very, very quickly.	Wali, wali jank’akiw.
More needs to be done.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
I don't like them at all.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj kunjamatsa gustkituti.
He didn't deny it to her.	Jupajj janiw uk jupar jan arskänti.
I started drinking every morning.	Sapa alwaw umañ qalltawayta.
I was cold and hungry.	Nayax thaya ukat manq’at awtjataw jikxatasiyäta.
But he seems to be a bad guy.	Ukampis jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
¡Don't do that!.	¡Jan ukham luramti!.
Why, it seems obvious to me.	Kunatsa, nayatakix qhanaw amuyasi.
We will see about this soon.	Uka tuqitxa jichhakiw uñjañäni.
But he thought he knew.	Ukampis yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
There really is no such thing.	Chiqansa janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
I want to see you there.	Nayax ukan uñjañ munta.
I have no problem doing that.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
Things moved quickly.	Kunanakas jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
It is important before you leave.	Janïr sarkasajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But he wasn't sure about it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uka toqet sum arskänti.
So that’s not the case.	Ukhama ukaxa janiwa utjkiti.
I'm going to	Nayax aka .
They didn't say anything.	Jupanakajj janiw kuns arskänti.
He called when.	Jupajj kunapachas jawsäna.
Now, that’s easy to do on your own.	Jichhax, ukax sapak lurañax wali ch’amawa.
But something about it didn’t really matter.	Ukampis kunas uka tuqitxa janiw chiqpachapunix wakiskänti.
Well it just does what it wants.	Suma ukax kuntix munki ukakiw luraski.
I’ve had it for two years.	Nayax pä maraw jikxatastxa.
It’s always all of these things.	Ukax sapa kutiw taqi ukanak lurañax utji.
Or a year after that.	Jan ukajj uka qhepat mä mara.
I don’t remember anything about him.	Janiw jupat kuns amtaskti.
He didn't want to talk first.	Jupajj janiw nayraqat parlañ munkänti.
That’s not to say.	Ukax janiw sañ muni.
You don’t have to do one thing.	Janiw mä kun lurañas wakiskiti.
No, he found himself.	Janiwa, jupa pachpaw jikxatasïna.
They know his full name.	Jupanakax taqpach sutip yatipxi.
Not everything is like that.	Janiw taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
There will be nothing to do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkaniti.
I didn’t see anything, really.	Janiw kuns uñjkti, chiqpachansa.
This might be the best for you.	Akax jumatakix wali askïspawa.
I don’t want to say more than that.	Nayax janiw ukat sipan juk’amp arsuñ munkti.
Today, that is not the case.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I know it’s very difficult.	Nayax yattwa ukax wali ch’amawa.
So he can do better next time.	Ukhamajj jutïr kutin jukʼamp sum luraspa.
I did it all myself.	Naya pachpaw taqe ukanak lurawayta.
It’s also very well located.	Ukhamaraki wali suma uñt’atawa.
He was doing completely wrong.	Jupajj qʼala jan walinak luraskäna.
But overall, it was a great night.	Ukampis taqe kunat sipansa, wali suma arumaw utjäna.
I really need to do more.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp lurañaw wakisispa.
He was eager to learn more.	Jupajj jukʼamp yatiñ wal munäna.
It almost always rains.	Niya sapa kutiw jallux puri.
He was staring at her intensely.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw uñchʼukiskäna.
Now he looked worried.	Jichhax jupax llakitaw uñnaqäna.
Double the amount.	Uka qullqix pä kutiw utji.
He’s my kind of guy.	Jupax nayan kasta jaqiwa.
I’m worried about the language.	Nayax arut llakistwa.
Maybe he can do something about himself.	Inas jupax jupa pachpat kuns luraspa.
He didn't say anything to her.	Janiw jupar kuns siskänti.
So good, so very good.	Ukhama suma, ukhama wali suma.
He did things alone.	Jupa sapakiw kuns luräna.
Not a whole evening.	Janiw mä taqpach jayp’ux ukhamäkiti.
I don’t want to make too much of it.	Janiw nayax ukat sinti lurañ munkti.
I’m so disappointed here.	Nayax wali llakitaw akanx jikxatasiyäta.
He was, he loved it.	Jupajj ukhamänwa, jupajj walpun munasïna.
It wasn’t a good night.	Janiw mä suma arumax utjkänti.

And yes, it can be useful.	Ukat jïsa, wali askïspawa.
There is nothing here.	Aka chiqanx janiw kunas utjkiti.
I know this doesn’t work for me.	Nayax yattwa akax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
He always played the piano.	Jupajj sapa kutiw piano tocañ yatïna.
It is strongly influenced by the .	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw uka .
It’s been a great, great time.	Mä jach’a, jach’a pachaw utjawayi.
Of course, that was some time ago.	Chiqansa, ukax mä qhawqha tiempo nayraw pasäna.
But he pulled hard.	Ukampis wali chʼamampiw jaqontäna.
This time, there’s nothing.	Jichha kutix, janiw kunas utjkiti.
That told me something.	Ukaw kuns yatiyäna.
He feels everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jikjjatasi.
It was, he knew it.	Ukajj ukhamänwa, jupajj uk sum yatïna.
I’m just like that .	Nayax ukhamakiw .
I didn’t understand what it was.	Kunsa uk janiw amuykayätti.
I’m not, with him.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkti, jupamp chika.
Except a lot quieter.	Jan ukasti walja amukiw juk’ampi.
You can’t do that everywhere.	Janiw taqi chiqan ukham lurañjamäkiti.
I’m serious about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali amuyumpiw uñjta.
Of course, there is no other way.	Chiqansa, janiw yaqha tuqitxa utjkiti.
The night comes quickly.	Arumax jank’akiw puri.
A terrific breakfast.	Mä wali muspharkañ desayuno.
He was obviously watching me.	Jupajj qhanaw nayar uñchʼukiskäna.
I want to take the car.	Nayax auto apsuñ munta.
You know he meant what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk sañ munäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
It’s really amazing to do.	Chiqpachansa, lurañax wali muspharkañawa.
I'm a very big guy.	Nayax wali jach'a jaqiwa.
But there is no such thing.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
This happened a couple of nights ago.	Ukax mä pä arumaw nayrax pasäna.
It’s also quieter.	Ukhamaraki, ukax juk’amp amukiw.
But, it’s not what you think.	Ukampis, janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.
But, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He wanted to buy it very soon.	Jupax wali jank’akiw alañ munäna.
Of course, this is very important.	Chiqansa, akax wali wakiskiriwa.
But then the issue is trivial.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw kunäkisa.
He gave me a little.	Mä juk’a churäna.
And he loved her so much.	Ukat jupar walpun munasïna.
But, like, it’s fun.	Ukampis, ukhama, wali kusiskañawa.
He was so crushing on me.	Jupajj nayaruw wal chʼalljjtayasïna.
It’s not that it’s not.	Janiw ukax ukhamäkiti.
I'm going to do that tomorrow.	Nayax qharüruw ukham lurañ amtasta.
You 're not	Jumax ukhamti .
I, too .	Nayax, wali .
That was the case at the time.	Uka tiemponjja ukhamänwa.
So no one wanted to talk to us.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis nanakamp parlañ munkänti.
But it arrived.	Ukampis ukajj purinïna.
There wasn’t and he knew it.	Janiw utjkänti ukat jupax uk yatïna.
It’s never a little long.	Janipuniw mä juk’a jaya pachax utjkiti.
Or maybe he needs help.	Jan ukajj yanaptʼa munasispa.
It seemed surprisingly tall.	Ukajj muspharkañ jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He uttered a word.	Jupajj mä arunak arsüna.
Why yes, yes it is.	Kunatsa jïsa, jïsa ukhamawa.
He almost wanted to know.	Jupax niyaw yatiñ munäna.
Maybe, somewhere.	Inas, mä chiqan.
No one wants that to happen.	Janiw khitis ukham pasañap munkiti.
I don't think that's a bad thing.	Nayatakejj ukajj janiw kuna jan walïkiti.
He somehow knew who he was.	Jupax kunjamatsa khitïnsa uk yatïna.
No one knows how to do it here.	Janiw khitis akan lurañ yatkiti.
And what about that.	Ukat kunas uka tuqitxa.
And why it hadn't happened before.	Ukat kunatsa nayrajj ukham jan paskäna.
He went to see her immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uñjir saräna.
I want someone here.	Nayax khitirus akan munta.
I still don't understand how.	Kunjamsa uk jichhakamajj janiw sum amuykti.
He never knew how he was doing financially.	Kunjamsa qollqe toqet jikjjatasïna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
But that's all there is to it.	Ukampis ukakiw ukatakejj utji.
That dominates the most.	Ukaw jukʼamp apnaqi.
In a prison cell.	Mä carcelan.
You have to do that .	Jumax ukham lurañamawa .
Where did that come from.	Kawkitsa ukajj jutäna.
He knew he knew.	Jupajj yattwa uk yatïna.
Everything will still be there.	Taqi kunas wali ch’amampiw utjani.
He did more of what he wanted to do.	Jupajj jukʼampiw kuntï lurañ munkäna uk luräna.
This was not anticipated.	Ukajj janiw nayratpach amuyaskänti.
There is nothing there.	Ukanjja, janiw kunas utjkiti.
He really didn’t like it.	Chiqpachansa janiw juparux gustkänti.
He refused to talk on the phone.	Jupajj janiw telefonot parltʼañ munkänti.
Breakfast is not included.	Desayuno ukax janiw utjkiti.
I need to do better on this.	Nayax aka tuqit juk’amp sum lurañaw wakisi.

I never ever want to do that.	Janipuniw janipuniw ukham lurañ munkti.
I don't know exactly what I mean.	Kuntï sañ munkta uk janiw sum yatkti.
It’s happened a couple of times now.	Jichhax mä pä kutiw ukham pasäna.
He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
There’s not much there.	Janiw sinti kunas ukanx utjkiti.
So I don't know how to do it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
You don’t have to do it at home.	Janiw utan lurañax wakiskiti.
This is the time to make a decision.	Akax mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
It almost always worked, except today.	Niya sapa kutiw irnaqäna, jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I hope he does it.	Jupajj uk lurañapatakiw suytʼaskta.
He just walks away.	Jupax ukhamakiw sarxi.
Now he was looking at her.	Jichhajj jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
And it just did and did.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw luratayna ukat luratayna.
He didn't understand what was happening to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna uk janiw amuykänti.
It went on for about a year.	Niya mä maraw ukham sarnaqäna.
As he said later.	Kunjamtï qhepat siskäna ukhama.
There was no such thing before.	Nayrajj janiw ukham ukham utjkänti.
That is all that will happen.	Ukajj taqe kunas pasani.
I was the only one who did it.	Naya sapakiw uk lurawayta.
I assume you already think you think.	Nayax amuyasta jumax niyaw amuyta amuyta.

You, with me.	Jumax, nayamp chika.

Not alone, alone.	Janiwa sapaki, sapaki.
I like him a lot.	Nayax juparux walpun sum uñjta.
Once, twice, and many more times.	Mä kuti, pä kuti, ukat jukʼamp walja kuti.
He felt like he was watching her.	Jupajj jupar uñchʼukiskäna ukhamwa amuyasïna.
That is how I felt about it.	Ukhamwa nayajj uka toqet amuyayäta.
Awesome, very nice!.	Wali muspharkañawa, wali sumawa!.
And let’s see.	Ukat uñjañäni.

That is what happened to me.	Ukaw nayarojj pasäna.
He died shortly afterwards.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempo qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
I can't figure out what the problem is.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjki uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
It is essential for this.	Ukatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
I don’t know his full name.	Janiw taqpach sutip yatkti.
He took it out.	Jupaw ukanak apsüna.
Well, maybe even better.	Ukhama, inas juk’ampi suma.
I don’t think anyone does at this point.	Nayax janiw khitis aka pachanx ukham lurkiti.
It seems to me to be good for you.	Nayatakix jumatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
I have nothing to do with this.	Nayax janiw kunas aka tuqit lurañ munkti.
That leaves three.	Ukax kimsa jaytawayi.
He stayed there for about a year.	Jupajj niya mä maraw ukan qheparäna.
Nothing really matters.	Janiw kunas chiqpachapunix wakiskiti.
That’s what I’m most excited about.	Ukax nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
Now you have to do it.	Jichhajj jumajj lurañamawa.
I really enjoyed her.	Chiqpachansa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
And another day.	Ukat yaqha uru.
He’s okay with that.	Jupax ukax walikïskiwa.
But he knows all about it.	Ukampis jupajj taqe ukanak sum yati.
He treated her with caution.	Juparux wali amuyumpiw uñjäna.
She turned him down again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar jan iyaw säna.
He was afraid he would never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti sasaw ajjsaräna.
The boy wanted to know what it was.	Uka waynax kunas uk yatiñ munäna.
You really can’t do it.	Chiqpachansa jumax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
That's how I feel.	Ukhamaw nayajj jikjjatasta.
He couldn't do it well.	Jupajj janiw ukanak sum lurañ puedkänti.

So far, no one has done it.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis lurkaspati.
Let’s see, he said.	Uñjañäni, sasaw säna.
It’s going pretty fast.	Ukax wali jank’akiw saraski.
How long will it take?.	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani?.
In this case, yes.	Aka tuqitxa, jïsa.
That’s awesome, she says.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, sasaw jupax saraki.
So these are the things that need to be done.	Ukhamajj ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
It meant nothing to me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
But they always know.	Ukampis jupanakax sapa kutiw yatipxi.
This is very rare.	Ukham lurañajj wali jukʼakiw utji.
I never wanted to tell you that.	Janipuniw ukham yatiyañ munkayätti.
But you might want to, but about that.	Ukampis inas ukham lurañ munsta, ukampis uka tuqitxa.
I am in love with that.	Uka tuqitxa wali munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
Everything really matters.	Chiqpachansa taqi kunas wali wakiskiriwa.
He rarely makes loud noises.	Jupajj jukʼakiw jachʼa arunak luraski.
Even better, he is a great teacher.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa, jupajj wali jachʼa yatichiriwa.
I’m probably saying.	Nayax inas sista.
The question repeated itself.	Uka jisktʼajj wasitatwa arsüna.
There is absolutely no reason for it.	Janipuniw kunatsa ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
It looks like the old one, this place.	Nayra uñtatawa, aka chiqa.
And it never happens there.	Ukat janipuniw uka chiqanx ukham utjkiti.
But that was very rare.	Ukampis ukajj wali jukʼakiw utjäna.
I don't want that myself.	Janiw naya pachpajj ukham munkti.
That's what happened after that.	Uka qhepatwa ukajj pasäna.
Except he doesn’t.	Jan ukasti jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
That justifies it.	Ukaw chiqapar uñji.
That they had again.	Ukajj jupanakajj wasitatwa utjäna.
He said nothing was wrong.	Janiw kunas jan walïkiti sasaw säna.
Now, that’s chess.	Jichhax, ukax ajedrez satawa.
Except, this was faster.	Jan ukasti, akax juk’amp jank’akiw utjäna.
Both sides needed it.	Panpachaniw ukajj wakisïna.

A little better.	Mä juk’a suma.
In fact, it is quite surprising.	Chiqansa, ukax wali muspharkañawa.

The next day is beautiful.	Qhipürux wali sumawa.

For three weeks it was rocking all the time.	Kimsa semanaw taqe tiempon chʼalljjtayasïna.
He did a lot of it.	Jupajj walpun luräna.
It was exactly what he wanted.	Kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamänwa.
He wanted that much more night.	Jupajj ukham jukʼamp arumaw munäna.
What a bad thing to do.	Kunas mä jan wali lurañasa.
I know what’s what.	Kunas kunas uk sum yatta.
Longer, this time.	Juk’ampi jaya, aka kutix.
He seems to know too much.	Jupax sinti yatkaspa ukhamawa.
It feels like that.	Ukax ukham amuyasi.
The house is warm and cozy.	Uka utax wali junt’u ukat sumaw jikxatasi.
He already knows about it.	Jupajj uka toqet niyaw yati.
That seems impossible to me.	Ukax nayatakix jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
He used to be no one at the time.	Jupajj nayrajj janiw khitis uka tiempon utjkänti.
He did get help.	Jupajj cheqapuniw yanaptʼa katoqäna.
I heard this twice.	Pä kutiw uk istʼta.
It handles very well.	Ukax wali sum apnaqi.
It just needed more time.	Jichhakiw jukʼamp tiempo munasïna.
The snowflakes are snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He really wanted out.	Chiqpachansa jupax mistuñ munäna.
Nothing, financially speaking.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, qullqi tuqitxa.
Small snowflakes.	Jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But it is important to take all the necessary steps.	Ukampis taqe kunatï wakiski ukanak lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
You find yourself.	Jumax juma pachpaw jikxatastaxa.
That's all he has left now.	Ukakiw jichhajj jaytawayi.

I’m hungry for more.	Nayax juk’amp manq’at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
He knew it all along.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yatïna.
He knows it well.	Jupajj sum yati.

No one knows what that is.	Ukax kunas uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I want to know a bit more about this.	Aka tuqitx mä juk’a juk’amp yatxatañ munta.
He didn't care what happened himself.	Jupa pachpajj kunas pasäna uk janiw kuns lurkänti.
But, it never happened.	Ukampis, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
We’ll see what comes.	Kunas jutani uk uñjañäni.
But look at how I decided to take pictures.	Ukampis kunjamsa fotonak apsuñ amtawayta uk uñjañäni.
That’s what an adult should do.	Ukhamaw jilïr jaqix lurañapa.
That’s obviously there.	Ukax qhanaw utji.

But today .	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa .
He can do it all on his own.	Jupajj jupa pachpaw taqe chuyma uk luraspa.
It really just happened.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamakiw pasäna.
Every morning, at least.	Sapa alwaw, mä juk’a pachax.
But he also wants to know the truth.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki uk yatiñwa munaraki.
This will have to be done.	Ukax lurañaw wakisini.
It’s high time we did that.	Ukham lurañax wali pachaw purini.

You don’t have to be rude to anyone.	Janiw khitirus jan walinak lurañax wakiskiti.

So he decided to.	Ukatwa jupajj amtäna.
I guess that was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyta.

There was no heat in the winter.	Juyphi pachanx janiw junt’u pachax utjkänti.
That’s what he expects.	Ukhamaw jupax suyt’i.

Don’t forget to buy a car.	Mä auto alañ armasimti.
He didn't need help.	Jupajj janiw yanaptʼa munkänti.

But you are more than that.	Ukampis jumajj jukʼampiw.

That was really lovely.	Ukajj cheqapuniw wali munasïna.
There are almost certainly not as many people as you would like.	Niya chiqpachansa janiw kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhamarjam walja jaqinakax utjkiti.

But he understood that.	Ukampis jupajj uk sumwa amuyäna.
But beyond that, there was him.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, jupaw utjäna.
It seemed out of control.	Ukajj jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.

He told this individual everything.	Uka sapa jaqiruw taqi kuns yatiyäna.

One new one every year.	Mä machaq sapa mara.

And there was no one.	Ukat janiw khitis utjkänti.
It’s so lovely to see.	Ukax wali munasiñampiw uñjasi.
Of course, he needed to do a lot worse.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisïna.

He said they were fine.	Jupajj jupanakajj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.

He could do it, he knew.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, uk jupajj sum yatïna.

They had to do it ten times.	Jupanakajj tunka kutiw ukham lurañajj wakisïna.

I don't want to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw uk lurañ munkti.

Not to mention what could happen to you.	Janiw kunas jumar pasaspa uk sañ munkti.
Because there is nothing, there is nothing.	Kunatix janiw kunas utjkiti, janiw kunas utjkiti.

Maybe a good breakfast, or just a good breakfast.	Inas mä suma desayuno, jan ukax mä suma desayuno ukhama.
And there’s no other way to do it.	Ukat janiw yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
This happened yesterday morning.	Akax qharüru alwaw utjawayi.

Of course, I know that is not the case.	Chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkiti uk yattwa.

But I can't figure out how.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
Something about that just doesn't work for me.	Uka toqet kunas nayatakejj janiw walïkiti.
He just stared at it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw uñchʼukiskäna.
That is what it all means.	Ukaw taqe ukanakajj sañ muni.

He knew how it was going to happen to him.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupar pasañap yatïna.
And then he didn't.	Ukat ukat jupajj janiw lurkänti.
It’s comfortable and delicious.	Ukax suma ukat wali sumawa.
A good one, yes.	Mä suma, jïsa.
It was obvious that this did not matter.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
It will always be there.	Ukax sapa kutiw utjani.
He really loves it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukanak wal munasi.
He was really mean to you.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jumamp jan walinak luräna.

He didn't mean it .	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti .
He watched her do things.	Jupajj kunjamsa kuns luri uk uñjäna.
Of course, this is not remotely possible.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw jaya chiqat lurañjamäkiti.
He didn't want to take his eyes off her.	Jupajj janiw nayranakap jupat apsuñ munkänti.
It’s more obvious.	Ukax juk’amp qhanawa.
Finally, morning came.	Qhepatjja, alwajj purinïna.
There was nothing in him.	Janiw kunas jupan utjkänti.
The day is still bright.	Uka urux wali qhanawa.
Good for you for that.	Ukatakix jumatakix wali askiwa.

But I love you so much.	Ukampis nayajj jumar walpun munasta.
And no, it really doesn’t matter.	Ukat janiw, chiqpachansa janiw kunäkisa.
He came here several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw aka cheqar jutäna.
But that is not what he wants.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jupajj munkiti.
But somehow you do that.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jumax ukham lurasma.

In fact, it means everything to me.	Chiqansa, nayatakix taqi kunaw sañ muni.

So far that’s been a bit of a chore.	Jichhakamax ukax mä juk’a lurañaw wakisïna.

That was his decision.	Ukajj jupaw amtäna.
It may take about three days.	Inas niya kimsa urunak sarañax wakischispa.
That was this morning.	Ukax jichha alwaw utjäna.
It’s hard, it really is.	Ukax ch’amawa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
They know about something.	Jupanakax kuna tuqitsa yatipxi.
I don't say anything now.	Jichhax janiw kuns siskti.
I asked him how long.	Ukat qawqha tiempos jupar jisktʼta.
People are not good enough.	Jaqinakax janiw askïkiti.

That’s the wrong thing.	Ukaw jan walïki.
I appreciate everything.	Nayax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I’m going there now.	Jichhax ukaruw saraskta.
Yes, a real car.	Jïsa, mä chiqpach auto.
I had no idea this could happen.	Ukajj pasaspa uk janiw amuykayätti.
He did that for us.	Jupaw jiwasatak ukham luräna.
He spoke to them quietly.	Jupanakar amukiw parläna.
Where could it be, he wondered.	Kawkhansa ukajj utjaspa, sasaw jisktʼasïna.
I’m just worried about you here.	Nayax jumat sapakiw akan llakista.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali sumawa.
He’s far, far away.	Jupax wali jaya, wali jaya.
That gave him some time.	Ukaw mä jukʼa tiempo churäna.
But all this happened after the 1990s.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj 1990 mara qhepatwa pasäna.
Let me know what you have to do.	Kuna lurañas utji uk yatiyapxita.
He just looked like he wanted to get out of there.	Jupax uka chiqat mistuñ munkaspa ukhamakiw uñnaqäna.

And he will do it.	Ukat jupaw uk lurani.

He didn't want to drive alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak auto apnaqañ munkänti.
He bought it.	Jupaw alasïna.
It’s a real surprise.	Chiqpach muspharkañawa.
I really want to see that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk uñjañ munta.
That was the beginning .	Ukaw qalltäna .
They are so nice and everything is so nice.	Jupanakax wali sumaw ukat taqi kunas wali sumawa.
While he was still asleep.	Jupajj wali ikiskäna ukhajja.
I've done it again.	Wasitat lurawayta.
But that really wasn’t the case.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
He did the better of the two.	Jupaw uka pä tuqitxa jukʼamp sum luräna.
No one understood.	Janiw khitis amuykänti.

I hope I never have to do that again.	Janiw mayamps ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasaw suytʼaskta.
But this one is better.	Ukampis akax jukʼamp sumawa.
He stared at her for a long moment.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
It’s like a yati.	Ukhamaw yati.
And there is no time to do anything.	Ukat janiw kuns lurañatakejj tiempojj utjkiti.

Don’t forget to let me know.	Janiw nayar yatiyañ armasimti.
I want to live, that’s all.	Nayax jakañ munta, ukakiw.
He never said much of anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kunsa wal siskänti.
He seemed so small and helpless.	Jupajj wali jiskʼa ukat jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
He wants to go there tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax uka chiqar sarañ muni.
I don't see how he could do that.	Kunjamsa ukham luraspäna uk janiw uñjkti.
But that was a long time coming.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow qheparäna.
So he told her.	Ukatwa jupar yatiyäna.
He can never do that here.	Ukjja janipuniw akan lurkaspati.
I mean everyone.	Nayax taqiniruw sañ munta.
So you can do all of that.	Ukhamajj taqe ukanak lurasma.
You can always do something new.	Sapa kutiw machaq lurañanak lurasma.
He felt very comfortable.	Jupajj wali sum jikjjatasïna.
He got everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa katoqäna.
He feels a little bit.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jikjjatasi.
I don’t know enough about myself.	Naya pachpat janiw sum yatkti.
If you want someone else, let me know.	Jumatix yaqha jaqir munsta ukhaxa, yatiyapxita.
Let me know if that works for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa, uk yatiyapxita.
But there was a problem.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna.
It’s a very nice view.	Ukax wali sumaw uñjasi.
That’s what he felt like.	Ukhamaw jupax ukham jikxatasïna.
Maybe a pretty good bit more.	Inas mä suma suma juk’ampi.

And he likes it a lot.	Ukat juparux wal gusti.
I think it looks better this way.	Nayax amuyta aka tuqitx juk’amp sumaw uñtasi.
Let's see how long it lasts.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utji uk uñjañäni.
I don't know how he feels about her.	Jupat kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk janiw yatkti.
I want to see you very soon.	Wali jank’akiw jumar uñjañ munta.
I didn’t have it.	Janiw nayajj utjkitänti.
Which he did very well.	Ukjja, wali sumwa luräna.
But, that doesn't matter.	Ukampis, janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
He could have done something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kuns luraspäna.
He didn't really like that.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun jupar gustkänti.
I have only one question.	Mä sapakiw jisktʼasta.
It just happened.	Jichhakiw ukham pasäna.
Small as well.	Jisk’a ukhamaraki.
That meant yesterday morning.	Ukajj qharüru alwaw sañ munäna.
I mean I want that.	Nayajj nayajj uk munta.
He wants to know what you did.	Jupajj kuntï lurawaykta uk yatiñ muni.
So he asked for more money.	Ukhamaw juk’amp qullqi mayïna.
I just know that’s it.	Nayax ukhamakiw yatta.
He loved her very, very much.	Jupajj wali, wali munasiñampiw jupar munasïna.

No one thought it would happen, but it did.	Janiw khitis ukham pasañap amuykänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
He wanted her to do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa ukham lurañap munäna.
I’m always so cold, so cold.	Nayax sapa kutiw wali thaya, wali thaya.
I don’t want to walk.	Janiw nayax sarnaqañ munkti.
You’ve always been in such a bad situation.	Jumax nayratpach ukham jan walin jikxatastaxa.

Not more than once.	Janiw mä kutis juk’ampi.

You’re welcome to go here.	Jumax aka chiqar sarañax wali askiwa.
Or I don't like it, anyway .	Jan ukajj janiw nayarojj gustkituti, kunjamatsa .
He didn't say he was a bad guy.	Janiw jupajj jan wali jaqëtap siskänti.
So much for the night.	Ukhama arumax.
Over and over again.	Walja kuti ukat walja kuti.
They don't know these things.	Jupanakajj janiw ukanak yatipkiti.
Almost never try to do that.	Niya janipuniw ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
I would like to say the following.	Uka tuqitxa akham sañ munta.
I think it’s still in there somewhere.	Nayax amuyta ukax waliw ukanx kawkhans utji.
Maybe it's worth it.	Inas ukajj wakisispa.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
He doesn’t work.	Jupax janiw irnaqkiti.
Very, very happy about it.	Wali, wali kusisitaw uka tuqitxa.
I think it’s pretty unusual.	Nayax wali jan uñt’atawa sasaw amuyta.
Almost anything with you a lot.	Niya kunas jumamp walja.
But that is not the best way to do it.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wali askïkiti.
He issued the orders.	Jupaw uka kamachinak apsüna.
You are truly an amazing person.	Chiqpachansa jumaxa wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
You can have yourself any time after that.	Uka qhepat kuna horasas juma pachpaw utjaspa.
I don’t see how.	Nayax janiw kunjamsa uk uñjkti.
That was what he was afraid of.	Ukaw jupajj wal ajjsaräna.
I don’t want to give it to them.	Janiw jupanakar churañ munkti.

But I didn’t know about him.	Ukampis janiw jupat yatkayätti.

A great first.	Mä jach’a nayrïr.
It can be a bit of both.	Mä juk’a panpachaniw utjaspa.
Almost everything else.	Niya taqi kunat sipansa.
A kind of snowflake.	Mä kasta ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He did this several times.	Ukjja walja kutiw ukham luräna.
He told me something about what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uka toqetwa mä jukʼa yatiyäna.
This one will do just that.	Aka maynix ukhamarakiw lurani.
Last time is better.	Qhipa kutix juk’amp askiwa.

I’m still not sure he’s okay.	Nayax wali jan sum yatkti jupax walikïskiwa.
He said real little things.	Jupax chiqpach jisk’a arunak arsüna.
Everything happened quickly.	Taqi kunas jankʼakiw pasäna.
But the question came quickly.	Ukampis uka jisktʼajj jankʼakiw jutäna.
That’s a nasty little surprise.	Ukax mä jan wali jisk’a muspharkañawa.
The process took hours.	Uka lurañajj walja horanakaw munasïna.
It was a regular school trip.	Ukajj sapa kutiw escuelar sarañatak utjäna.
He didn’t know or understand.	Janiw yatkänti ni amuyaskänti.
He feared everything about himself.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupa pachpat ajjsaräna.
To my surprise, he agreed.	Jupajj iyaw sasaw wal muspharta.
Last year was better.	Nayra marax juk’amp askiwa.
I’m going to find out.	Nayax uk yatxatañ amtasta.
I’m going to see him.	Nayax jupar uñjir sarä.
That was all that was needed.	Ukakiw wakisïna.
It really means a lot.	Chiqpachansa walja sañ muni.
This is good, because it’s impossible.	Akax wali askiwa, kunatix janiw lurañjamäkiti.
They’re used to doing that.	Jupanakax ukham lurañ yatipxi.
But he’s exactly that.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
So these two.	Ukhama aka pä.
It took about three years.	Ukatakejj niya kimsa maraw munasïna.
Very excited indeed.	Wali kusisitaw chiqpachansa.
But it doesn’t really matter.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachansa kunäkisa.
But it’s not always the case.	Ukampis sapa kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
That was nobody.	Ukajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
And that’s exactly what he did.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw luräna.
But it’s been a bad thing.	Ukampis jan walinak lurawayi.
This guy is awesome.	Aka waynax wali muspharkañawa.
I want to stay there.	Nayax ukan qhiparañ munta.
A beautiful, beautiful book.	Mä suma, suma libro.

He can be himself.	Jupa pachpaw utjaspa.
I’m going to like that.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa.
I don’t want to say too much.	Janiw sinti arsuñ munkti.
He arrived at ten.	Jupajj tunka horasaruw purinïna.
He knew tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax yatïna.
I’ve been doing this all day.	Taqi uruw ukham lurawayta.
So he joined me and joined us.	Ukatwa nayamp chika sarjjäna ukat nanakamp chikaw sarjjäna.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Jupajj nayamp parltʼañ munta sasaw säna.
Not a no, not a yes.	Janiw mä janiwa, janiwa mä jïsa.
It is very important .	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa .
That’s his best so far.	Ukax jichhakamax jupan wali sumawa.
There’s only one.	Ukax mä sapakiw.
Because I think there’s no such thing.	Kunatix nayax amuyta janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
No permit required.	Janiw permiso ukax wakiskiti.
But it wasn't like that before.	Ukampis janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.

I am very worried about myself.	Naya pachpat wal llakista.
I came to the area.	Nayajj uka cheqar jutta.
There with you.	Ukan jumamp chika.
That’s what he wanted.	Ukhamaw jupax munäna.
I thought maybe I needed it.	Inas ukajj munasispa sasaw amuyayäta.
There’s something really exciting about that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa kunas wali kusiskañawa.
No money of course.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti chiqpachansa.
But then it got to me.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, nayaruw puri.
I want to get out as soon as possible.	Nayax jank'akiw mistuñ munta.
Now, nothing works.	Jichhax, janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
Small but effective.	Jisk’a ukampis wali askiwa.
So not, obviously.	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkiti, qhanaw amuyasi.
But that was a lot more than he felt.	Ukampis ukajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp jukʼampiw jikjjatasïna.
I want to see it from a different perspective.	Nayax yaqha tuqit uñjañ munta.
He couldn't stay long on anything.	Jupajj janiw kuna toqet walja tiempo qheparañ puedkänti.
And it’s really big.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw jach’a.
The last day.	Qhipa uru.
That was you guys.	Ukajj jumajj ukhamänwa.
He loves to innovate and create.	Jupax machaq lurañanak lurañsa ukat lurañsa wal muni.
He knew he couldn't last much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati uk sum yatïna.
He was very thin and thin.	Jupajj wali jiskʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqënwa.
And it was at the time.	Ukat uka tiemponjja ukhamänwa.
He was terrified of me.	Jupajj nayat wal ajjsaräna.
This restaurant is beautiful.	Aka manq’añ utax wali sumawa.
He wasn't sure what to say next.	Jupajj janiw kuntï jutïrin siskäna uk sum yatkänti.

But he didn’t do them.	Ukampis janiw jupanakar lurkänti.
Dear me, I don’t.	Munat naya, janiw.
But you have to do it yourself.	Ukampis juma pachpaw ukham lurañama.
You’re always in such a bad mood.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham jan walin jikxatasïta.
I only saw it once.	Mä kutikiw uñjta.

I’m sorry for the delay.	Nayax uka qhipharux llakistwa.
I don't see the problem there.	Ukan jan waltʼäwejj janiw uñjkti.

It’s a very big guy.	Wali jach’a jaqiwa.
Make things faster when you can.	Kunapachatï wakiski ukhaxa, jankʼakiw yänak lurañama.
He had some stuff with him.	Jupampiw mä qawqha yänak utjäna.
He wanted something, but he didn't know exactly what he wanted.	Jupajj kunsa munäna, ukampis kunsa munäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
That’s me again.	Ukax nayax wasitatwa.
He knew exactly what he was going to do.	Jupajj kuns lurani uk sum yatïna.
No, he doesn't have that.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw jupan utjkiti.

Everything here means everything.	Taqi kunas akanx taqi kunas sañ muni.
That’s really good.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali askiwa.

He doesn’t really .	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun .
And no, there was not a slight problem there.	Ukat janiw, janiw mä jiskʼa jan waltʼäwis ukan utjkänti.
It is important to do this properly.	Uk sum lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Or do something about it.	Jan ukax kuns lurañamawa.
This is definitely something that needs to be avoided altogether.	Chiqpachansa akax mä kunaw jan taqpach lurañax wakisi.
I think he’s better than that.	Nayax amuyta jupax ukat sipan juk’amp askiwa.
But what does it matter.	Ukampis kunas ukajj wakisi.
In fact, he loved her.	Chiqansa, jupax juparux walpun munasïna.
He shook it sadly.	Jupax llakitaw uk ch’allxtayäna.
It was a very nice cold.	Wali suma thaya.
But the question is ambiguous.	Ukampis uka jisktʼajj janiw sum amuykiti.
Not so, which is surprising.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj muspharkañawa.
That doesn’t work well.	Ukax janiw sum irnaqkiti.
I did a great walk.	Nayax wali jach’a sarnaqañ lurawayta.
You’ve had it for decades.	Jumax tunka maranakaw ukham jikxatastaxa.

That's what it should do.	Ukajj ukham lurañapawa.
He agreed to it.	Jupajj uka toqet iyaw sänwa.
I feel the same way.	Nayax ukhamarakiw amuyasta.
The same is true.	Uka pachpajj wali askiwa.
So far I plan to do two.	Jichhakamax pä lurañ amtasta.
He wanted to do that very much.	Jupajj ukham lurañ wal munäna.
He hoped it would happen anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa ukham utjani sasaw suyäna.
I just started driving.	Jichhakiw auto apnaqañ qalltawayta.
He had no idea how to react.	Jupajj kunjamsa kuns lurani uk janiw amuykänti.
But something out there needs to be done.	Ukampis uka anqan kunas lurañaw wakisi.
He never said it.	Janipuniw arskänti.
But then he died soon after.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
He did that, and did well there.	Jupax ukham luratayna, ukat ukanx wali sum luratayna.
I'm more than happy.	Nayax juk'amp kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That's how I feel about it.	Ukajj kunjamsa uka toqet jikjjatasta ukajja.
I’m sorry yesterday morning.	Nayax qharüru alwax llakistwa.

It still looks new, too.	Wali machaq uñtatawa, ukhamaraki.
He was happy, of course.	Jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.

And that was obvious.	Ukat ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

Once, only once.	Mä kuti, mä kutikiw.
No, this seemed to work for me.	Janiwa, akax nayatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
It worked hard on him, too.	Juparux wali ch’amampiw irnaqäna, ukhamaraki.
He expected her to do so.	Jupajj ukham lurañapawa sasaw suyäna.
That wasn't enough for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskänti.
There’s a little bit of space.	Ukanx mä jisk’a chiqaw utji.

In fact, it’s good for you.	Chiqansa, jumatakix wali askiwa.
But he was watching her intently.	Ukampis jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I expect big things from him this season.	Jupat aka pachanx jach’a yänak suyt’ta.
He has every single one.	Jupax sapa mayniw utji.
Anyway, that’s what I used to say.	Kawkhansa, ukax nayrax ukham sañ muni.
She’s a beautiful woman, she is.	Jupax wali suma warmiwa, jupax ukhamawa.
So that’s what he does.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj luri.
Like he did with me.	Kunjamtï nayamp lurkäna ukhama.
But obviously, he wasn't.	Ukampis qhanawa, jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
John immediately threw them away.	Juanajj jankʼakiw jupanakar jaqontäna.
That seems to mean nothing.	Ukajj janis kuns sañ munkaspa ukhamawa.
In any case.	Kawkïr tuqitsa.
Time is of the essence.	Tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
He leaves them, always.	Jupax jupanakar jaytawayi, sapa kuti.
It is often found in the area.	Ukax walja kutiw uka chiqan jikxatasi.
What you did yesterday doesn't matter.	Kuntï qharüru lurawaykta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
And yes, it feels good.	Ukat jïsa, wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But he asked the question.	Ukampis sasaw jisktʼäna.
I want to get there.	Ukar puriñ munta.
The man was found.	Uka jaqejj jikjjatasïna.
What are you waiting for? 	¿Kunsa jumajj suytʼaskta?
Of course, he saw it immediately.	Chiqansa, jankʼakiw uk uñjäna.
You really understand that.	Chiqpachansa jumax uk amuyasta.
And what .	Ukat kunas .
Anyway, that’s me now.	Kawkhansa, ukax nayax jichhax.
It was not inside.	Ukajj janiw manqhan utjkänti.
And that is a valid question.	Ukat uka jisktʼajj walikïskiwa.
And no you weren’t.	Ukat janiw jumax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I want to be honest with you.	Nayax jumanakat chiqapar sarnaqañ munta.
I want to live in the future again.	Nayax wasitat jutïr pachan jakañ munta.
I knew no one else could.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati uk sum yatiyäta.
So, I want to reiterate that.	Ukhama, uka tuqit wasitat arsuñ munta.
He knew he was a good man.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëtap sum yatïna.
He didn't want to go out like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham mistuñ munkänti.
When something actually happened, it was really nothing.	Kunapachatï kunas chiqpachapuni paskäna ukhaxa, chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkänti.
I’ve been here for a year now.	Jichhax mä maraw akanktxa.
I can't quite figure it out.	Uka tuqitxa janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
He is not sure what the future holds.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk janiw sum yatkiti.
Better than anything else.	Taqi kunat sipansa juk’amp askiwa.
You’ll feel good tonight.	Jichha arumax wali sumaw jikxatasïta.
That doesn't mean you didn't like it.	Ukajj janiw jumar jan gustkänti sañ munkiti.
What he had always wanted.	Kuntï jupajj nayratpach munkäna ukjja.
That is not the case today.	Jichha tiempon ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak munkänti.
The box is more stable.	Ukaxa juk’ampi sumawa.
And he knew it well.	Ukat jupax uk sum yatïna.
It is not the case .	Janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti .
That's the guy.	Ukajj uka jaqewa.
I want to tell you .	Nayax jumanakar yatiyañ munta .
And then he told me what was next.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, kunas jutïrin utjani sasaw sitäna.
Afterwards, he went home.	Uka qhepatjja, utaparuw kuttʼjjäna.
None of that is here.	Ukanakat janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
See how you like that.	Kunjamsa ukajj jumatak gusti uk uñjañäni.
So soft and warm.	Ukhama llamp’u ukat junt’u.
I'm so worried about him right now.	Jichhakiw jupat wal llakista.
I know you feel that way.	Nayax yattwa jumax ukham jikxatastaxa.
He admitted it with some sadness.	Jupajj mä jukʼa llakitaw uk iyaw säna.
I don’t remember a word.	Janiw mä arut amtaskti.
I really don't know.	Chiqansa janiw yatkti.
You're safe with us.	Jumax nanakamp chikaw jan kuna jan walt'äwin jikxatasïta.
And yes, it is a little weird.	Ukat jïsa, mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
He was not sure why he would come here.	Jupajj kunatsa akan jutani uk janiw sum yatkänti.
It has nothing to do with anyone, really.	Janiw khitimpis kuns lurkiti, chiqpachansa.
She can't have him like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham jupajj utjkaspati.
But last night .	Ukampis qhipa arumax .
Too much to do this morning and no coffee.	Jichha alwax sinti lurañaw ukat janiw café ukax utjkiti.
No, never, he insists.	Janiwa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupax arsu.
Of course it never is.	Chiqansa janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Above all, this is very important.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.

You need to do more.	Jumax juk’amp lurañaw wakisi.

And it had to be done again.	Ukat wasitatwa lurañajj wakisïna.
This does not mean agreeing on everything.	Ukajj janiw taqe toqet mä amtar puriñ sañ munkiti.
And he knew the truth.	Ukat kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatïna.
He does this to everyone.	Jupax taqiniruw ukham luri.
That’s really how it felt.	Ukhamaw chiqpachansa ukham amuyasïna.
We have the bigger one.	Jiwasax juk’amp jach’a ukaw utjistu.
This happened more often.	Ukajj jukʼampiw pasäna.
It will take longer than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow munasini.
He didn't mention it anywhere.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kawkhansa arskänti.
But isn't it?.	Ukampis ¿janich ukhamäki?.
But don't miss out on this big problem.	Ukampis janiw uka jachʼa jan waltʼäwejj jaytañamäkiti.
If you want to know more please let me know!.	Jumatix juk'amp yatxatañ munsta ukhax yatiyapxita!.
There wasn’t a whole lot going on.	Janiw mä taqpach kunas utjkänti.
I don’t know what to tell him.	Janiw kuns jupar yatiyañ yatkti.
She was thin and cold.	Jupajj jiskʼa ukat thaya ukhamänwa.
He seemed to be a sincere man.	Jupajj taqe chuyma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
That leaves two.	Ukax pä jaytawayi.
I barely saw him.	Jupar jukʼakiw uñjta.
I prefer the long term.	Nayax jaya pacharuw juk’amp munta.
None of that matters, it would be good.	Janiw kunas ukax kunäkisa, wali askïspawa.
He was the only one who said it.	Jupa sapakiw uk arsüna.
Or that doesn't matter to me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
He doesn’t know how to say it right.	Jupax janiw kunjams chiqapar arsu uk yatkiti.
He didn't want you .	Jupajj janiw jumar munkänti .
I know enough to do that.	Nayax uk lurañatakix walja yattwa.
The next day was another day.	Qhipürux yaqha uruw utjäna.
I am very grateful.	Nayajj wal yuspärta.
A very strange time.	Mä wali muspharkañ tiempo.
But there is one thing that will always be there.	Ukampis mä kunaw utji, ukajj sapa kutiw utjani.
I want him to go soon.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sarañapatak munta.
He did not know why she had come to him.	Kunatsa jupar jutäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He knew how to play.	Jupajj kunjamsa anattʼañ yatïna.
He keeps busy on the phone.	Jupajj telefonot jan tiemponiw uñji.
The day of the house is coming.	Wasitat uruw purini.
It’s like that for me.	Nayatakix ukhamawa.
I never thought it would happen.	Janipuniw ukham pasani sasin amuyirïkti.
There’s always one.	Sapa kutiw maynix utji.
I mean the amount of time in time.	Nayax tiempon qhawqha tiempos utji uk sañ munta.
I told him no.	Nayajj jupar janiw sasaw sista.
I repeat this over and over again.	Ukxa walja kutiw wasitat arsu.
He had her with him.	Jupajj jupampiw utjäna.
The most important thing to note is that.	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa, ukax akham sañ muni.
He doesn't have what it takes.	Jupajj janiw kunatï wakiski ukajj utjkiti.
But there was something great about him.	Ukampis jupat mä jachʼa kunaw utjäna.
But that happened today.	Ukampis jichhüruw ukajj pasäna.
I don’t want to see him tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw jupar uñjañ munkti.
You just do it the way you can.	Kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukhamakiw lurasma.
I very rarely realize this.	Nayax wali juk’akiw uk amuyasta.
But that's not what I said.	Ukampis janiw ukajj nayajj siskänti.
He cannot stand it.	Jupajj janiw uk aguantañjamäkiti.
I really understand that.	Chiqpachansa uk amuyasta.
Always wrong.	Sapa kuti jan wali.
This again is not unusual.	Ukax wasitat janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
He was an adult.	Jupajj jilïr jaqënwa.
And it’s .	Ukat ukax .
And the week before.	Ukat uka semana nayrax.
No one is doing anything.	Janiw khitis kuns lurkiti.

Then there was nothing for about an hour.	Ukat niya mä horaw jan kunas utjkänti.
It was a pretty long one.	Mä suma jaya tiempow utjäna.
Almost nothing.	Niya janiw kunäkisa.
He had just fallen asleep.	Jupajj jichhakiw ikiskäna.
The same kind of .	Uka pachpa kasta .
That made it really hard.	Ukax chiqpachansa ch’am tukuyäna.
Me, of course.	Nayax, chiqpachansa.
And here’s something that can happen.	Ukat akax mä juk’a kunas pasaspa.
But in the end, it works.	Ukampis qhepatjja, ukajj walikïskiwa.
You know it, you’ve always known it.	Jumax uk yatisktawa, nayratpachaw uk yatta.
I did one thing right today.	Jichhürunakanxa mä kunwa chiqapar lurawayta.
You better not do that.	Jumanakajj jan ukanak lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
He stayed with her.	Jupampiw qheparäna.
But you don’t want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ munktati.
I’m looking forward to doing more.	Nayax juk’amp lurañ suyt’askta.

That’s the best thing you can do.	Ukax wali suma lurañamawa.
He wants to fly.	Jupax avión ukan irnaqañ muni.
You’re right about that.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
Nay’s smile.	Nayra ch’uqi.
I love him in the film.	Nayax juparux película ukanx walpun munasta.
Someone more famous than me.	Maynix nayat sipan juk’amp uñt’atawa.
He did it for me once.	Jupax mä kutiw nayatakix uk luratayna.
He began to investigate.	Jupax yatxatañ qalltäna.
He didn't want to live like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham jakañ munkänti.
Well, it’s better than that, actually.	Ukhama, ukat sipansa juk’amp askiwa, chiqpachansa.
But that wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis ukajj janiw munkänti.
I just didn't have that in me.	Nayajj janiw ukajj nayan utjkitänti.
There was no reason, but it was.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkänti, jan ukasti ukhamänwa.
I never, ever want to see them.	Janipuniw, janipuniw jupanakar uñjañ munkti.
In fact, it was midnight that day.	Chiqansa, chika arumaw uka urux utjäna.
Either that or that.	Ukhama jan ukax ukhama.

But you never were.	Ukampis janipuniw jumajj ukhamäkänti.

Tell him it’s urgent.	Ukax jank’akiw sasaw jupar yatiyañama.
That will take some time to learn.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow yatiñ munasini.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk luraspänwa.
He said he wasn't.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkti sasaw säna.
It decided not to do so.	Ukajj jan ukham lurañwa amtäna.

He felt something.	Jupax kuns jikxatasïna.
Now he wants justice.	Jichhax jupax chiqapar uñjañ muni.

I went to see it there.	Nayax ukan uñjir sarawayta.
I, of course, denied it.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, ukax janiw sasaw arsuwayta.
The man looked at him.	Uka jaqejj jupar uñjäna.
He was afraid he wouldn't.	Jupajj janiw sasaw ajjsaräna.

Great, for one thing.	Jach’a, mä tuqitxa.
That’s what I mean.	Ukhama sañ munta.
He must do well.	Jupajj sum lurañapawa.

But he used to be a good man.	Ukampis nayrajj wali suma jaqënwa.
So she agreed to a marriage proposal.	Ukatwa casarasiñatak mä amtar iyaw säna.
It’s like that and that’s it.	Ukhama ukhamaraki ukhama.
I didn’t want to keep it a secret.	Janiw jamasat yatiyañ munkayätti.
He tried to do what was right.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
No one seems to know what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamawa.
What it is not.	Kunatï jan ukhamäki ukawa.
Very slow slow.	Sinti jaya jaya.
But it doesn’t work right now.	Ukampis jichhax janiw irnaqkiti.

Except he was very quiet.	Jan ukasti jupax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.

One day he did this.	Mä urux ukham luratayna.

So he went with her.	Ukatwa jupamp chika sarjjäna.
These are the right things.	Ukanakajj walikïskiwa.
He was in love with her.	Jupajj munasiñampiw jikjjatasïna.
I didn’t know how to go about it.	Nayax janiw kunjams uka tuqit sarañ yatkayätti.
He knew what he was planning.	Jupajj kuntï amtkäna uk sum yatïna.
And he doesn’t do that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.

Now he just did something.	Jichhax jupax ukhamakiw kuns luräna.
He’s always done that.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham luratayna.

I’m sorry, he says.	Nayax llakistwa, sasaw saraki.
Not a good thing, he thought.	Janiw mä askïkiti, sasaw amuyäna.

So there can be no more problem.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp jan waltʼäwejj utjkaspati.

So he turned around.	Ukatwa jupajj kuttʼjjäna.

And unlike me, he always had a good time.	Ukat nayat sipansa, jupax sapa kutiw wali sum sarnaqäna.

I decided to work on it.	Nayax uka tuqit irnaqañ amtawayta.

I gave it to him.	Nayaw jupar uk churta.

To their surprise, he said no.	Jupanakajj wal muspharäna, jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
You act quickly and responsibly.	Jumax jankʼakiw ukat wali amuyumpiw kuns lurasma.
Not once did I sense anything wrong with him.	Janiw mä kutis jupat kuna jan waltʼäwis amuyaskänti.

He didn't want to eat at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa manqʼañ munkänti.

And now let’s see what happened.	Ukat jichhax kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
In an important way, of course.	Mä wakiskir tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
She wondered where he was now.	Jichhajj kawkinsa jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasïna.

Something more was needed.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp kunaw wakisïna.

He was doing great, thank you very much.	Jupax wali sum luraskäna, walpun yuspärta.

And why he needed help at home.	Ukat kunatsa utan yanaptʼa munäna.

No time for lunch.	Janiw chika uru manq’añ pachax utjkiti.

He didn’t do that last time, either.	Jupax janiw qhipa kutix ukham lurkänti, ukhamaraki.
I decided to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ amtawayta.
And in many cases it works.	Ukat walja kutix walikïskiwa.

There is nothing wrong with that, he thought.	Ukanjja, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He was a big man there.	Jupajj ukan jachʼa jaqënwa.
It rarely works, it never works.	Janiw juk’ampi irnaqkiti, janipuniw irnaqkiti.
He talked about her all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jupat parläna.
He wants more money.	Jupajj jukʼamp qollqe muni.
This is exactly what happened.	Ukajj cheqapuniw kunjamtï paskäna ukajj pasäna.

And that is even more so today.	Ukat jichhürunakanjja, ukajj jukʼampiw utji.

But that, surprisingly, is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj, muspharkañawa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Sometime this summer, at least.	Mä juk’a pachax aka verano, juk’ampi.

It takes a lot of energy.	Mä jach’a ch’amaw munasïna.
But one day.	Ukampis mä urux.

He was tall and thin.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqënwa, jiskʼa jaqënwa.

He told her something.	Jupaw jupar mä jukʼa yatiyäna.

Then he looked around again.	Ukat wasitatwa uñchʼukiskäna.

He walked around a lot.	Jupax wal sarnaqäna.

I am going to see him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjir saraskta.
¡That's not a bad thing!.	¡Ukajj janiw jan walïkiti!.
It was thoroughly shaken up.	Ukajj wali sumwa chʼalljjtayasïna.
And his own as well.	Ukat jupan pachpa ukhamaraki.
He didn't say anything for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw kuns arskänti.
Consider the facts.	Kunatï cheqäki ukanakat uñjañäni.
I didn’t see a car.	Janiw mä auto uñjkti.
Now this is even more surprising.	Jichhax akax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
This is the best school for me.	Aka yatiqañ utax nayatakix wali askiwa.
But what can he do .	Ukampis kunsa luraspa .
Or just one of them.	Jan ukajj mä sapaki.
I never really knew.	Janipuniw cheqpachapun yatkti.
I think you could do worse.	Nayax amuyta, jumax juk’amp jan walinak lurasma.
Cold rainy night.	Thaya jallu arumax.
He doesn’t want to walk.	Jupax janiw sarnaqañ munkiti.
No one said anything the whole time.	Taqi uka tiempox janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
He wants to do things right.	Jupajj kunanaktï cheqäki uk lurañwa muni.
I think he did one of the worst.	Nayax amuyta, jupax mä jan walinak luratayna.
You think for yourself.	Juma pachpaw amuyta.
Strange, but effective.	Muspharkañawa, ukampis wali askiwa.
He wondered what else he could do.	Uka yaqha tuqitxa kunsa luraspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He left to go to work.	Jupajj irnaqäwir sarañatakiw sarjjäna.
He came with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw jutäna.

Nothing yet, he decided.	Janiw kunas jichhakamax utjkiti, sasaw amtäna.

Or, maybe you think that's a much prettier look.	Jan ukajj, inas ukajj jukʼamp suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuyasta.
Better late than never.	Janipuniw lurañat sipansa qhipürux jukʼamp askiwa.

He was doing an amazing job.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ luraskäna.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj nayaruw wal munasïna.
None of it means anything to me.	Janiw kunas nayatakix kuns sañ munkiti.

And of course, you can do better.	Ukat chiqpachansa, jumax jukʼamp sum lurasma.
This is always the case.	Ukajj sapa kutiw utji.
He bought it himself.	Jupa pachpaw alasïna.
He’s a very happy young man.	Jupax wali kusisit waynawa.
He was lying there for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow ukan ikiskäna.
So far I’ve done both.	Jichhakamax panpachaniw lurawayta.
He came hard this morning.	Jupax jichha alwax wali ch’amampiw jutäna.
There was no real money in the area.	Uka chiqanx janiw chiqpach qullqix utjkänti.
We’re kind of good there.	Jiwasax mä juk’a ukanx wali askiwa.
It really doesn’t matter to me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix kunäkisa.
He’s, he’s okay.	Jupaw, walikïskiwa.
I didn’t want that to happen again.	Ukham wasitat pasañap janiw munkayätti.
I think it could be both.	Panpachaniw utjaspa sasaw amuyta.
But there is no absolute certainty.	Ukampis janiw kunatï cheqpach cheqäki ukajj utjkiti.
He has to do something.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapawa.
I don’t mean a little bit.	Nayax janiw mä juk’a sañ munkti.
I never want to stop caring for you, ever.	Janipuniw jumar uñjañ jaytañ munkti, janipuniw.
He somehow leaves quickly.	Jupax kunjamatsa jank’akiw sarxi.
How he feels about it.	Kunjamsa jupajj amuyi.
But it is what it says.	Ukampis kuntï siski ukawa.
Of course this is the future.	Chiqansa akax jutïrin utjani ukawa.
Or maybe two or three.	Jan ukajj inas pä jan ukajj kimsa.
I really did everything.	Chiqpachansa taqi kunsa lurawayta.
He loved it with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw munasïna.
But it can still be useful.	Ukampis wali askïspawa.
But that doesn't matter.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj janiw kunäkisa.
No reason I don’t see it.	Janiw kuna razonas jan uñjkti.
I wish he couldn’t do anything.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkaspati sasaw munta.
It’s fun but a little hard.	Ukax kusiskañawa ukampis mä juk’a ch’amawa.
He ended up loving her.	Jupar munasiñampiw tukuyäna.
I don’t agree with that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I can’t believe you came here alone.	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti, juma sapakiw akan jutta.
Try not to do that.	Jan ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
I wonder who told them.	Khitis jupanakar yatiyäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
It still feels lonely.	Wali sapakiw jikxatasi.
Yes, it was the way he looked at her.	Jïsa, kunjamtï jupar uñchʼukiskäna ukhamänwa.
Everything seems to be fine.	Taqi kunas wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
He learned very quickly.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw yateqäna.
He knows exactly where he wants to go.	Kawkirus sarañ munki uk sum yati.
We don’t have all day.	Jiwasax janiw taqpach urux utjkiti.

And, no problem at all.	Ukat, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He wanted it that way.	Jupajj ukhamwa uk munäna.
And that night.	Ukat uka arumax.
I’m definitely not the first person to notice this.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax nayrïr jaqix uk uñjkti.
I really want to see this place one day.	Chiqpachansa mä urux aka chiqar uñjañ munta.
He got the message.	Jupaw uka yatiyäw katoqäna.
They told me to tell them.	Jupanakajj yatiyapjjeta sasaw sapjjetäna.
But tonight he wanted nothing to do with her.	Ukampis jichha arumax janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkänti.
He gladly accepted the job.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uka trabajo katoqäna.
I think it’s good for me.	Nayatakix wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.

But there could be something.	Ukampis kunas utjaspa.
And the country's old.	Ukat uka markan nayra.
No one really said anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
I want to make the most of that time.	Uka tiempojj sum apnaqañ munta.
That didn't appeal to them at all.	Ukajj janiw jupanakar kuns gustkänti.
It literally took hours.	Chiqpachansa, walja horanakaw munasïna.
But yeah, it was delicious.	Ukampis jïsa, wali sumapunïnwa.
Today, these are not available.	Jichhürunakanxa, janiw ukanakax utjkiti.
Everything is always in danger.	Taqi kunas sapa kutiw jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
But he has me.	Ukampis jupajj nayaruw utjitu.
He decided to tell about himself, too.	Jupax jupa pachpat yatiyañ amtäna, ukhamaraki.
That’s how it is.	Ukhamaw kunjamsa.
And they know better, too.	Ukat jupanakax juk’amp sum yatipxi, ukhamaraki.
We’ll do both.	Jiwasax panpachaniw lurañäni.
They’re a lot of fun.	Jupanakax wali kusiskañawa.

He built a house.	Jupaw mä uta luräna.
I know no one likes him, but still.	Nayax yattwa janiw khitis jupar gustkiti, ukampis wali.
He wants to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurañ muni.
He thinks people think he’s cool.	Jupax jaqinakax jupax wali sumaw sasaw amuyi.
I think there was something about that night.	Uka arumax kunas utjäna sasaw amuyta.
And another year.	Ukat yaqha mara.

He made a great decision.	Jupajj wali jachʼa amtäna.
Nothing more needed to be done.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj wakiskänti.
Of course that’s not me.	Chiqansa ukax janiw nayax.
It did not affect me.	Ukajj janiw nayarojj jan walinak lurkänti.
He told her the secret.	Jupaw uka jamasat yatiyäna.
But someone wants to pay the price for some reason.	Ukampis maynix kunatsa uka qullqi churañ munaraki.
I want to know immediately.	Nayax jank’akiw yatiñ munta.
When something happens.	Kuna pachas kunas pasaspa.
Soft and soft and warm.	Llamp’u ukat llamp’u ukat junt’u.
And he started well.	Ukat jupax wali sum qalltäna.
This should be done with caution.	Ukax wali amuyumpiw lurañapa.
I never expected to see you here.	Janipuniw jumar akan uñjañ suykayätti.

He said he didn’t see anything unusual.	Jupax janiw kuna jan uñt’at yänak uñjkti sasaw säna.
He didn't want to talk to her at all.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupamp parlañ munkänti.

No one knows what’s in there.	Janiw khitis kunas ukan utji uk yatkiti.
In fact, I don't want to do that again.	Chiqansa, janiw mayampsa ukham lurañ munkti.
I want to drive it.	Nayax uka auto apnaqañ munta.
That’s why everything happened.	Ukatwa taqe kunas pasäna.
Well, they already know.	Ukhama, jupanakax nayratpach yatipxi.
He said yes of course.	Jupax chiqpachansa jïsa sasaw säna.
He did, but not for long.	Ukhamwa luräna, ukampis janiw jaya tiempojj ukham lurkänti.
He told everyone.	Jupax taqiniruw yatiyäna.
And there is certainly a uniqueness there.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukanx mä sapa mayniw utji.
He knew everything now.	Jupajj jichhajj taqe kunwa yatïna.
He knows it, but he doesn't know it.	Jupajj uk sum yati, ukampis janiw uk yatkiti.
He was never very good at it.	Jupajj janipuniw uka toqet wali sum yatkänti.
But it was very shaky.	Ukampis ukajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He told me that many times.	Walja kutiw ukham sitäna.
He would never have done such a bad thing.	Janipuniw ukham jan walinak lurkaspänti.
For two years he cared for her.	Pä maraw jupajj jupar uñjäna.
In fact, don’t forget.	Chiqpachansa, jan armasimti.

I really love that about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqit walpun munasta.
There’s a lot of snow in the area.	Ukhama ukaxa wali ch’amawa.
Great maybe about it, though.	Jach’a inas uka tuqitxa, ukampis.

Actually a first person.	Chiqansa mä nayrïr jaqiwa.
He decided to do so.	Ukham lurañwa amtäna.
He said that for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham säna.
So that's not really the case.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj cheqpachapun ukhamäkiti.
But there is room for improvement.	Ukampis jukʼamp sum lurañatakix mä chiqaw utji.
All that different kind of wine.	Taqi uka yaqha kasta vino.
But, not this time.	Ukampis, janiw aka kutin utjkiti.

He’s the one who made her.	Jupaw jupar luräna.

Don’t do it in secret.	Janiw jamasat lurañamäkiti.
You are a lovely person.	Jumax wali munat jaqiwa.

And he’s so excited.	Ukat jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He asks me all the time.	Jupax sapa kutiw jiskt’itu.
I don't quite understand why.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum amuykti.
But I don’t think so.	Ukampis janiw ukham siskti.
He shouldn't be doing that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañapäkiti.
He didn't really understand anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns cheqpachapun amuykänti.
He is still very rare in the country.	Jupax jichhakamax uka markanx wali juk’akiw jikxatasi.
And that last night.	Ukat uka qhipa arumax.

There’s something you’d love to hear.	Kuna kunas jumatakix wali askïspa.

Of course, he knew about it all along.	Chiqansa, nayratpachaw uka tuqit yatïna.

I’m not saying I won’t.	Janiw nayax janiw sañ munkti.
It’s so much worse.	Ukhama juk’ampi jan wali.
But there is nothing about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitxa utjkiti.

I want to talk to everyone about something.	Taqiniruw kuna tuqit parltʼañ munta.

But do it quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk luram.
I just thought this was cool!.	¡Jichhakiw amuyta akax wali sumawa!.
I’d rather go for a cup of coffee.	Nayax juk’amp askiwa, ukat mä café umañar sarañax wali askiwa.
That’s the worst case scenario.	Ukaw wali jan walin uñjasi.
I don’t want to work.	Janiw nayax irnaqañ munkti.
Not once, not once did he know that.	Janiw mä kutis, ni mä kutis uk yatkänti.
It was partially empty.	Ukax mä chikat ch’uqi satänwa.
He didn't say anything about her.	Jupajj janiw jupat kuns arskänti.
So it can really speed up the game.	Ukhamajj cheqapuniw uka anattʼañ jankʼak luraspa.
And that’s just what you have to do.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw lurañama.
I never wanted anyone to use this word for me.	Janipuniw khitis nayatakix aka aru apnaqañ munkti.
It was a human being.	Ukajj jaqënwa.

But now he doesn't.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukham lurkiti.

It was another long, ugly moment.	Yaqha jach’a, jan wali pachaw utjäna.
But it never works well.	Ukampis janipuniw sum irnaqkiti.

And he clearly wanted something.	Ukat qhanaw kuns munäna.
Therefore, it is not a good thing.	Ukatwa jan walïkiti.
You had to do that.	Jumax ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
I thought he was that kind of person.	Jupajj ukham jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
Just this one time.	Ukhama aka mä kuti.
But of course, that’s not really the case.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.

You’re the smallest person.	Jumax juk’amp jisk’a jaqiwa.

It’s not impossible, but it’s very, very difficult.	Janiw jan lurañjamäkiti, jan ukasti wali, wali ch’amawa.
I don't want one.	Janiw mä jukʼa munkti.
Yeah, but it’s okay.	Jïsa, ukampis walikïskiwa.
He decided that he did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw amtäna.
He didn't tell her.	Jupajj janiw jupar siskänti.
Money isn’t like that.	Qullqix janiw ukhamäkiti.
Let’s see what happens next in the future.	Jutïrin kunas jutïrin pasani uk uñjañäni.
I’ve always wanted to go there.	Nayax nayratpach uka chiqar sarañ munta.
He stayed one morning .	Jupajj mä alwaw qheparäna .

Therefore, it needs to be improved.	Ukatwa, jukʼamp sum lurañajj wakisi.

At one time, there was a moment.	Mä tiemponjja, mä jukʼa tiempow utjäna.

These things can take longer than one thinks.	Ukanakax maynix amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow pasaspa.
Nothing more can be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw jukʼamp lurañjamäkiti.
Much too much.	Walja sinti jach’a.
Not short and not big.	Janiw jisk’a ukat jan jach’a.
And money, money.	Ukat qullqi, qullqi.
He wants somewhere to go.	Jupajj kawkirus sarañapa uk muni.
He knows better than to do that.	Uk lurañat sipansa Jupaw jukʼamp sum yati.
That, it didn’t exist.	Ukax, janiw utjkänti.
But he said nothing about what happened.	Ukampis kunatï paskäna uka toqet janiw kuns siskänti.
There can be no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkaspati.
I know who I am.	Nayajj khitis uk sum yatta.
To his surprise, this was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj wal muspharäna.

There's no need to go any further.	Janiw juk'ampi sarañax wakiskiti.

That’s clearer to me, now.	Ukax nayatakix juk’amp qhanawa, jichhax.

There’s always another day.	Sapa kutiw yaqha urux utji.

No reason, really.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
There, this	Ukanjja, aka .
The timing is crucial.	Uka tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
So it pretty much goes like this.	Ukhamajj niya ukhamaw saraski.
He didn't think he really wanted to know.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun yatiñ munkaspa ukham amuykänti.

And there he goes.	Ukat ukaruw jupax saraski.

He said he didn't care.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurkti sasaw säna.
But he can’t do it alone.	Ukampis janiw sapaki uk lurkaspati.
Of course, the opposite is true.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.

And it doesn’t work.	Ukat janiw irnaqkiti.
Of course, he can do anything with anyone.	Chiqansa, khitimpis kuns luraspa.

If you want to do it, do it.	Jumatix lurañ munsta ukhaxa, lurañamawa.

So that's a valid question.	Ukhamajj uka jisktʼajj walikïskiwa.
But thanks to everyone.	Ukampis taqiniruw yuspärta.
So he gave them the truth.	Ukatwa kunatï cheqäki uk jupanakar churäna.
Is there a way to do this?.	¿Uka lurañatakix kunas utji?.
I never found this place again.	Janiw mayamps aka chiqar jikxatkti.

But he knew better than that.	Ukampis jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatïna.
He asked her what she should do.	Kunsa lurañama sasaw jisktʼäna.
So I never thought of it.	Ukhamajj janipuniw amuyirïkti.
I feel worse than anyone, myself.	Nayax khitirus juk’amp jan waliw jikxatastxa, naya pachpa.

But one remained in prison.	Ukampis mayniw carcelan qheparäna.
How does he feel about it?.	¿Kunjamsa jupajj uka toqet amuyi?.
They tend to get out quickly.	Jupanakax jank’akiw mistuñ yatipxi.
He doesn't understand you.	Jupajj janiw jumar amuykiti.

He loved everything about it.	Jupajj taqe kunwa uka toqet wal munäna.
And even less financially, of course.	Ukat jukʼamp jukʼampiw qullqi tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

But he had done a lot of bad things.	Ukampis jupajj walja jan walinak luratayna.
I know everyone here is too.	Nayax yattwa taqiniw akanx ukhamaraki.

He decided to do more research first.	Jupax nayraqat juk’amp yatxatañ lurañ amtäna.

So he finally agreed.	Ukatwa qhepat iyaw säna.

So you tell me.	Ukhamajj jumajj nayar yatiyapjjeta.
I don't understand the problem.	Nayajj janiw uka jan waltʼäwejj amuykti.
It was the way he did it.	Ukajj kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamänwa.
That was all anyone talked about.	Ukajj taqe kunaw khitis parläna.
He doesn't think he can do anything about it.	Jupajj janiw kunsa uka toqet lurañapatak amuykiti.

They’re in good shape and more importantly, they’re popular.	Jupanakax wali suma uñt’atawa ukat juk’amp wakiskiriwa, wali uñt’atawa.
And he’s willing to pay a very high price.	Ukat jupax wali jach’a qullqi churañ munaraki.
So did the other one.	Ukhamarakiw maynix luräna.
But he loves what he just said.	Ukampis kuntï jichhak siskäna uk jupajj walpun munasi.
He worked alone.	Jupax sapakiw irnaqäna.
And what isn’t.	Ukat kunas jan ukhamäki.
And he wants to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañwa munaraki.
He was the first to leave.	Jupaw nayrïr jaqejj sarjjäna.
He always says such nice things about you.	Jupax sapa kutiw jumat ukham suma arunak arsu.
For hours he wondered what he should do.	Walja horanakaw kunsa lurañapa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Because not doing it is incredible.	Kunatix jan lurañax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
But you can do something about it right now.	Ukampis jichhakiw uka tuqitxa kuns lurasma.
He could always do that.	Jupajj sapa kutiw ukham luraspäna.
In the summer it rains twice a day.	Jallu pachanx pä kutiw urux jallux puri.
And what an amazing time it all can be.	Ukat kuna muspharkañ pachas taqi kunas utjaspa.
I decided to give.	Nayax churañ amtawayta.
I realized something.	Nayax mä kuns amuyasta.
You can’t do that here.	Janiw akan ukham lurañjamäkiti.
Or where he went to school.	Jan ukajj kawkirus escuelar saräna.
Maybe one day, he’ll say that.	Inas mä urux, jupax ukham sañ muni.
I needed something more.	Nayajj jukʼamp kunaw munasïna.

He said something to her.	Jupajj jupar kuns sänwa.
He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kuns lurañwa munäna.
Winter snow, too.	Juyphi ch’uqi, ukhamaraki.
He appreciates it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak wali askit uñji.
Or it's not right.	Jan ukajj janiw walïkiti.
I really need to do it myself.	Chiqpachansa naya pachpa lurañaw wakisi.
He seemed to look worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
Let's see how useful this can be.	Kunjamsa ukajj wali askïspa uk uñjañäni.
He just didn’t have it, that’s all.	Jupax janiw ukax utjkänti, ukakiw.
Too bad it wasn’t in the past.	Sinti jan waliw nayra pachanx janiw ukhamäkänti.
It feels nice and warm.	Suma ukat junt’u jikxatasi.
That goes without saying, but we have to do it again.	Ukajj janiw sañjamäkiti, ukampis wasitatwa lurañasa.
I’m a really nice person.	Chiqpachansa wali suma jaqïtwa.
He could do that for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham luraspäna.
Where, how, where will he do it.	Kawkhansa, kunjamatsa, kawkhansa lurani.
There was something strange.	Mä muspharkañ kunaw utjäna.
He knew it, fool.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna, loqhe.

He knew the words somewhere.	Jupajj kawkhansa uka arunak yatïna.
I didn’t get a chance last year.	Nayax janiw nayrïr marax mä ch’am jikxatkti.
He had a bad night.	Jupajj jan wali arumaw pasäna.
He knew I wouldn't.	Janiw ukham lurkäti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
Just like a man does.	Kunjamtï mä chachan luraski ukhama.

That was not the case with me.	Nayampejj janiw ukhamäkänti.

But that's not the worst part.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
But no one knew that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
It’s a really good location.	Chiqpachansa wali suma uñt’atawa.
He was surprised by it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa wal muspharäna.
That’s actually .	Ukax chiqpachansa .
So that's obvious.	Ukhamajj ukajj qhanawa.
We will all do the same.	Taqeniw ukham lurañäni.
It looks too naked.	Sinti q’ala uñnaqaniwa.
He was even more shaken up.	Jupajj jukʼampiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
Someone else is better for you.	Maynix jumatakix juk’amp askiwa.
That’s the way it is right there.	Ukhamaw uka chiqanx uñjasi.
So do something about it.	Ukhamajj kuns luram.
I don’t want to now.	Jichhax janiw munkti.
I come from far, far away.	Nayax jaya, jaya chiqat jutta.
In fact, there is no time limit.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
And so this is very important and necessary.	Ukat ukhamarakiw akax wali wakiskiriwa ukat wakiskiriwa.
It was no big deal at all.	Ukajj janiw kuna jachʼa lurañas utjkänti.
But really, or better yet.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, jan ukax jukʼamp askiwa.
Tomorrow is better.	Qhipürux juk’amp askiwa.
It took two long years.	Ukatakejj pä jachʼa maraw munasïna.
I didn’t want to go inside.	Janiw mantañ munkayätti.
No, no, that’s not the case.	Janiwa, janiwa, ukaxa janiwa ukhamäkiti.
All the while, he was in deep distress.	Taqe uka tiemponjja, wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
It stayed that way for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham qheparäna.
He had seen her the day before.	Jupajj nayra uruw jupar uñjäna.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Jupajj nayat taqe kun yatiñ munäna.
This was always a problem.	Ukajj sapa kutiw mä jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.

And this is what surprises me.	Ukat akax nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.

But that is not necessary now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I want to live with him.	Nayax jupamp chikaw jakañ munta.
I came through it.	Nayax uka tuqit jutta.
But he wanted to do something wrong.	Ukampis jupajj jan walinak lurañwa munäna.
It was a really great morning.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a alwaw utjäna.
I’m sorry, I can’t have this.	Nayax llakistwa, janiw akax utjkaspati.
It’s so worth it.	Ukham wali askiwa.
I decided to play along with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw anattʼañ amtawayta.
It almost didn’t happen.	Niya janiw ukhamäkänti.
Why would he do that?.	¿Kunatsa ukham luraspäna?.
He doesn’t know yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax yatkiti.
You understand time.	Jumax tiempo amuyasta.
He never knew what happened after him.	Jupa qhepat kunas pasäna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
Which he didn't want to do.	Ukajj janiw lurañ munkänti.
He’s a good guy.	Jupax suma waynawa.

And no one said anything.	Ukat janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
Nothing will ever slow down.	Janipuniw kunas juk’ampi juk’ampi utjkaniti.
He was a slow mover.	Jupajj akham sänwa.
I told them that.	Nayaw jupanakar ukham sista.
He went home with her.	Jupajj jupamp chikaw utapar saräna.
You have been good so far.	Jumax jichhakamax wali askiwa.
Or there is just something else.	Jan ukajj yaqha ukhamakiw utji.
You know he is.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax ukhamawa.
I already feel bad about it.	Uka tuqitxa niyaw jan walin jikxatastxa.

That’s all it comes down to.	Ukax taqpach ukaruw puri.
I’m waiting a long time.	Nayax wali jaya suyt’askta.
And now everything is fine.	Ukat jichhax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
But this is even more surprising.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
But he couldn't get the words out.	Ukampis janiw uka arunak apsuñ puedkänti.
I still think it’s you.	Nayax wali amuyta jumaw sasaw amuyasta.
They had nothing, nothing.	Jupanakax janiw kunas utjkänti, janiw kunas utjkänti.
No, there was nothing like that.	Janiwa, janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.
He immediately went to bed.	Ukat jankʼakiw ikiñar sarxäna.
If you have the money.	Jumatix qullqix utjki ukhaxa.
I never expected all of this to happen.	Janipuniw ukanak taqe kunas pasañap suykayätti.
The food was excellent.	Manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa.
I know he doesn’t, not really.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
He needs to do something, and he needs to do something on his own.	Jupax kuns lurañapawa, ukat jupa pachpaw kuns lurañapa.
That’s why it happened.	Ukatwa ukham pasäna.
But he knew he had to do better than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurañapa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He did this, almost every day.	Ukhamwa luräna, niya sapa uru.
So that won't be a problem.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
That is why he wanted to talk to you.	Ukatwa jupajj jumamp parltʼañ munäna.
The money was needed immediately.	Qullqix jank'akiw munasïna.
That’s kind of nice, too.	Ukax mä kasta sumawa, ukhamaraki.
Someone has done them great harm.	Mayniw jupanakar jachʼa jan walinak lurawayi.
I want to know about him.	Jupat yatiñ munta.
Not how he wanted to go tonight.	Janiw kunjamtï jichha arumax sarañ munkäna ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing to do in the country.	Uka markanx janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Of course, I was sad.	Chiqansa, llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Jan wali, jan wali, wali jan wali.
I could have done everything right.	Nayajj taqe kunwa sum luraspäna.
He was always curious.	Jupajj sapa kutiw yatiñ munäna.
It doesn’t want to work well in hot weather.	Janiw junt’u pachanx sum irnaqañ munkiti.
He finished it all completely.	Jupajj taqe ukanak taqpach tukuyäna.
You have to be sincere and sincere.	Taqe chuymaw taqe chuyma chʼamachasiñama.
Certainly not before.	Chiqansa janiw nayrax ukhamäkänti.
And there is nothing better to do.	Ukat janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
I think that would be better.	Ukajj jukʼamp askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
He doesn't know how to use it.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ yatkiti.
It is difficult to do wrong.	Jan walinak lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
It definitely worked.	Ukajj cheqapuniw irnaqäna.
Instead, he was.	Jan ukasti, jupax ukhamänwa.
I don't know too much about it now.	Jichhajj janiw uka toqet sinti sum yatkti.
Do what you are told.	Kuntï jumax siskta uk luram.
No one thought so, but it was.	Janiw khitis ukham amuykänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
It’s always the smallest, the smallest and the last, but it never matters.	Sapa kutiw jisk’a, jisk’a ukat qhipa, ukampis janipuniw kunäkisa.
But he knew it wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
Now, but secretly.	Jichhax, ukampis jamasat.
But then that didn't matter.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
I want to know who knew.	Khitis yatïna uk yatiñ munta.
He said he was in love.	Jupax munasiñampiw jikxatasi sasaw säna.
I think that stayed with him.	Ukajj jupamp chikaw qheparäna sasaw amuyta.
Which he definitely wasn’t.	Ukax jupax chiqpachapuniw jan ukhamäkänti.
I didn’t see anyone with him.	Janiw khitirus jupamp chik uñjkti.
He said it never happened.	Jupax janipuniw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
It also feels good.	Ukhamaraki wali suma jikxatasi.

So do as you please.	Ukhamajj kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam luram.

I would love to see him.	Nayajj jupar uñjañ walpun munta.
At the time, I had no idea why.	Uka tiemponjja, kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw amuykayätti.
To be honest, the opposite is true.	Chiqpachansa, uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
You can’t do that .	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti .
I think I need to do that now.	Nayax amuyta, jichhax uk lurañaw wakisi.
He is the victim.	Jupaw uka jan walin uñjasi.

But he was still sad.	Ukampis wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
But these will be more and more common.	Ukampis ukanakajj jukʼampiw jukʼampiw utjani.
He was right on both counts.	Jupajj uka pä toqetwa cheq parläna.
He is such a good teacher.	Jupajj ukham suma yatichiriwa.
But that is a good question.	Ukampis uka jisktʼajj wali askiwa.
He is in charge of all of this.	Jupaw taqi ukanak apnaqi.
He seemed uncertain.	Jupajj jan sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
It took time, years.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasïna, walja maranakaw munasïna.
He said that wasn't right.	Ukajj janiw walïkiti sasaw säna.
Everything is clearer.	Taqi kunas juk’amp qhanawa.

You didn’t know that.	Jumax janiw uk yatkayätati.

He desperately needed a bed.	Jupajj mä ikiñ wal munäna.
It sucked big time.	Ukax jach’a pacharuw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
The bad weather stayed there for another week.	Jan wali tiempojj yaqha semanaw ukan qheparäna.
It wasn't what he had just said.	Janiw kuntï jichhak siskäna ukhamäkänti.
He couldn't do it right.	Jupajj janiw sum lurañ puedkänti.
It’s based on the language.	Ukax arut uñt’atawa.
The process took a while.	Uka lurañax mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.

Not the bad kind.	Janiw jan wali kasta.

He doesn't know when it will happen, but he knows it will.	Kunapachas pasani uk janiw yatkiti, ukampis ukajj pasani uk sum yati.

I told him not to do it.	Nayajj jan luramti sasaw sista.

Never had to do one before.	Janipuniw nayrajj mä lurañajj wakiskänti.
He’s very important to me.	Jupax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
I would have done it sooner rather than later.	Nayajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw jan lurayäta.
He was tall and imposing.	Jupajj jachʼa jachʼa ukat jachʼa jaqënwa.
He was very cautious about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
I think he’s awesome.	Nayax jupax wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyta.
I really can’t believe it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He can't have that.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkaspati.

Taking responsibility for yourself is important.	Juma pachpaw kuns lurañama, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But he says he is disappointed.	Ukampis jupax llakitaw jikxatasi sasaw saraki.
He wanted to know who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk yatiñwa munäna.
He went back to his bedroom.	Jupajj ikiñ utaparuw kuttʼjjäna.
It’s kind of, in a weird way, a gift.	Mä kasta, mä muspharkañ tuqitxa, mä regalo ukhamawa.
At the time, this was never the case.	Uka tiemponjja, janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
Or it’s pretty good.	Jan ukax wali sumawa.

You either agree or disagree.	Jumax iyaw satawa jan ukax janiw satawa.

He really wanted to make a party out of it.	Jupajj ukat mä fiesta lurañ wal munäna.
Not one night but many nights.	Janiw mä arumax utjkiti jan ukasti walja arumaw utji.
He’ll be home tomorrow.	Qhipürux utaparuw purini.

But it looked like it meant more.	Ukampis jukʼamp sañ munkaspa ukhamwa uñnaqäna.

You need to do that.	Jumax ukham lurañaw wakisi.

But that’s not all there is to it.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kunas utjkiti.

He didn't say much.	Jupajj janiw walpun arskänti.
He really loved her back.	Chiqpachansa, juparux wasitatwa munasïna.

The only question is the timing.	Uka jisktʼajj kuna horasas wakisispa ukakiw utji.

No, there was something about him, he decided.	Janiwa, kunas jupat utjäna, sasaw amtäna.
He can do things on his own.	Jupa pachpaw kuns luraspa.
And, best of all, you do well.	Ukat, taqi kunat sipansa, jumax wali sumwa lurasma.
He didn't know what he wanted from her.	Kuntï jupat munkäna uk janiw yatkänti.
That’s partly what he was.	Ukax mä chiqanx jupax ukhamänwa.
He didn't say what happened.	Janiw kunas paskäna uk arskänti.
There was nowhere to go in this regard.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kawkirus sarañax utjkänti.
Little did he tell her.	Juk’akiw jupar yatiyäna.
He didn't want to explain too much.	Jupajj janiw sinti amuytʼayañ munkänti.
They really don't know anything wrong with him.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis juparux yatipkiti.

He knows what is best for us.	Jupaw kunas jiwasatak askïspa uk sum yati.
I never did prison time.	Janipuniw carcelan tiempo lurkti.

He gave me a room.	Jupajj mä cuarto churitu.
But that is not the case .	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti .
It was actually almost too good.	Chiqpachansa niya wali sumapunïnwa.
Of course this is a bit of a challenge.	Chiqansa akax mä juk’a ch’amawa.
He was a very, very nice person.	Jupajj wali, wali suma jaqënwa.

I’m also sure it doesn’t matter.	Nayax ukhamarakiw yatxatasta, ukax janiw kunäkisa.

Something inside me.	Kunas nayan manqhan utji.

Rather, he obviously did.	Jan ukasti qhanaw ukham luräna.
He squeezed me.	Jupajj nayaruw chʼalljjtayasïna.
Of course, this is not appropriate.	Chiqansa janiw ukax askïkiti.
It was such a beautiful night.	Ukham suma arumaw utjäna.
I did not expect it to happen so quickly.	Ukham jankʼak pasañap janiw suykayätti.

The reason for this was obvious.	Ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.

But again, it wasn't.	Ukampis mayampsa janiw ukhamäkänti.

He didn't do anything in a house.	Jupajj janiw mä utan kuns lurkänti.

There was no need to hurry.	Janiw jankʼak lurañajj wakiskänti.
In fact, someone actually did.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa mayniw uk lurawayi.
The first night he didn’t notice.	Nayrïr arumax janiw amuyaskänti.
A sleepless night followed.	Uka qhepatjja, mä jan ikiñ arumaw purinïna.
So he didn't want that to happen to him.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham jupar pasañap munkänti.
A few times a day is not enough.	Mä qhawqha kuti urux janiw wakiskiti.
Well, almost alone.	Ukhama, niya sapaki.

You have to do something.	Jumaw kuns lurañama.
There is a bad thing that will happen.	Kuna jan waliw pasani.
It’s not the best, but it’s familiar.	Janiw juk’amp askïkiti, jan ukasti uñt’atawa.

Finally, he decided what to do.	Qhepatjja, kun lurañsa amtäna.
They are less likely to be hospitalized.	Jupanakax janiw sinti hospitalar mantañ yatipkiti.

I never thought he would do anything.	Janipuniw kuns lurani sasin amuyirïkti.
It doesn’t work that way here.	Janiw ukham akanx irnaqkiti.
He did it himself.	Ukjja jupa pachpaw luräna.
I really love it!.	¡Chiqpachansa walpun munasta!.
What do we have here? 	¿Kunsa jiwasajj akan utjistu?
I intend to see that.	Nayax uk uñjañ amtasta.
He knows he has to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañapawa sasaw yati.
That was a year and a quarter ago.	Ukajj mä mara mä cuarto nayraw pasäna.
So do it the way you want it.	Ukhamajj kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam lurañamawa.
Something in that moment stirred him.	Uka pachanx kunas juparux ch’allxtayäna.
That was three years ago, and it is now.	Ukajj kimsa mara nayraw pasäna, jichhajj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
Let’s see them again.	Jupanakar wasitat uñjañäni.
I’ve said it many times.	Nayax walja kutiw arsuwayta.
All of this is truly unbearable.	Taqe ukanakajj cheqapuniw jan aguantañjamäkiti.
There is a lot of value in doing this.	Uk lurañajj wali askiwa.
That’s all he’s doing right now.	Ukakiw jichhax luraski.
He wants to come home, he wants to see her.	Jupax utar puriñ muni, jupar uñjañ muni.
Yes, he wanted to talk a lot.	Jïsa, jupajj wal parlañ munäna.
You are everything he is right now.	Jumax taqi kunatix jupax jichhax utjki ukawa.
That gave him strength.	Ukaw jupar chʼam churäna.
He wants to see what happens next.	Jupax kunas jutïrin pasani uk uñjañ muni.
Overall, it feels great.	Taqi kunat sipansa, wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But it could be better.	Ukampis jukʼamp sumaw pasaspa.
I have two taxis now.	Jichhax pä taxi ukaniwa.
He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañsa wal munäna.
So it is no different.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
Also, and this is a surprise.	Ukhamaraki, ukat akax mä muspharkañawa.
And he’s with you.	Ukat jupax jumamp chika.
He has to do both.	Jupax panpachaniw lurañapa.
I personally like him a lot.	Naya pachpaw jupar wal gustitu.
I don't understand anything.	Nayajj janiw kunsa amuykti.
I feel like you’re yourself.	Nayax juma pachpaw jikxatastxa.
He does it all together.	Jupajj taqeniw uk luri.
I remember it very well.	Wali sum amtasta.
Its small but delicious.	Uka jisk’a ukampis wali suma.
Here’s why .	Akax kunatsa .
Wherever, whatever you do.	Kawkhansa, kunsa lurasma.
I don’t like this one at all.	Nayax janiw akax kuns gustkituti.
Very hot day today.	Jichhürunakanx wali junt’u uru.
Now he knows what to do.	Jichhajj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yati.
Today was not a bad day.	Jichhürunakanxa, janiw jan wali urux utjkänti.
I can't help but feel so depressed.	Janiw kuns lurirjamäkti, sinti llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I think it’s better on such a day.	Nayax amuyta, ukham urux juk’amp askiwa.
They will soon do it.	Jupanakajj niyaw lurañäni.
You have to do it both ways.	Panpachaniw uk lurañama.
Let’s take a good look at him.	Juparux wali sum uñjañäni.
Can't really stand it.	Janiw chiqpachansa uka tuqit aguantañjamäkiti.
They’re tough, and that’s good.	Jupanakax wali ch’amawa, ukax wali askiwa.
He knew exactly what I was thinking.	Jupajj kuntï nayajj amuykta uk sum yatïna.
It is surprisingly beautiful.	Ukajj muspharkañ sumawa.
In fact, he never said what he said to me.	Chiqansa, kuntï jupax nayatak siskäna uk janipuniw arskänti.
This isn’t cold weather.	Akax janiw thaya pachax utjkiti.
He would have done it, had he done it.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, uk luraspäna ukhajja.
He lives in silence.	Jupax amukiw jakasi.
Or so he said.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj säna.
I appreciate that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali askit uñjta.
They don't know what's wrong.	Jupanakajj janiw yatipkiti kunas jan walïki ukjja.
Well a few days ago for the first time.	Suma mä qawqha urunak nayrax nayrïr kutiw.
I know right from wrong.	Nayajj kunatï walïki jan walïki uk sum yatta.
But he was depressed.	Ukampis jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I want to make a decision.	Nayax mä amtar puriñ munta.
Also a great house.	Ukhamaraki mä jach’a uta.
It happened really fast for me.	Chiqpachansa jankʼakiw nayatakix pasäna.
And he walked quickly.	Ukat jupax jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
That’s what you mean.	Ukax juma sañ muni.
Of course, that was it.	Chiqansa, ukax ukhamänwa.
He hasn't been to see me in a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan nayar uñjir sarkiti.
No one told him to do it.	Janiw khitis uk luram siskänti.
I’m doing everything.	Nayax taqi kuns luraskta.
I look forward to learning about this elsewhere.	Nayax yaqha chiqan aka tuqit yatxatañ suyt’askta.
And he finally said no.	Ukat qhepatjja, janiw sasaw säna.
He really likes her, you know.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw juparux munasi, jumax yatisktawa.
But he went back again.	Ukampis jupajj wasitatwa kuttʼjjäna.
Far, far away.	Jaya, jaya.
He left about noon.	Jupajj niya chika uruw sarjjäna.
There’s a power there.	Ukanx mä ch’amaw utji.
These are called snowflakes.	Ukanakax ch’uqi satawa.
And you have to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañamawa.
Didn't like it that much.	Janiw ukham gustkänti.
You don't like me at all, as you tell yourself.	Janiw nayarojj kunjamatsa munktati, kunjamtï juma pachpa siskta ukhama.
I think it’s a person.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä jaqiwa.
But obviously this isn’t fun.	Ukampis qhanaw akax jan kusiskañawa.
You don’t really want to know.	Jumax janiw chiqpachapuni yatiñ munktati.
He reported that he was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa sasaw yatiyäna.
He didn’t talk about it, he didn’t do anything else.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit arskänti, janiw yaqha tuqit lurkänti.
I redid the whole room.	Nayax taqpach cuarto wasitat lurawayta.
He was always on the move.	Jupajj sapa kutiw sarnaqäna.
Well, it’s very old and very unknown.	Ukhama, wali nayra ukat wali jan uñt’atawa.
And that goes a long way.	Ukat ukax wali jaya pachaw saraski.
They mean nothing to me.	Jupanakax nayatakix janiw kunäkisa.
That's what he did best.	Ukaw jupajj wali sum luräna.
He’s a guy, after all.	Jupax mä waynawa, taqi kunat sipansa.
He got all the responsibility.	Jupajj taqe lurañanak katoqäna.
Now, you’re welcome.	Jichhax, jumax wali askiwa.
Not after what happened here.	Janiw kunatï akan paskäna uka qhepatjja.
There is no need to do anything.	Janiw kunas lurañax wakiskiti.
But he thought he was a good guy.	Ukampis wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
And now someone wanted to tell me again.	Ukat jichhax maynix wasitat yatiyañ munäna.
What is the best way to do the same thing.	Kunas uka pachpa lurañatakix wali askïspa.
Anything can happen here.	Aka chiqanx kunas pasaspa.
I'm so sorry the other night.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa yaqha arumax.
But I like them both.	Ukampis panpachaniw nayajj gustitu.
No, no, he says.	Janiwa, janiwa, sasaw jupax saraki.
That was not the case this morning.	Jichha alwajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And that wasn’t the case here.	Ukat aka chiqanx janiw ukhamäkänti.
All of these are .	Taqi ukanakax .
That made him the ultimate target.	Ukaw jupar qhep qhepa amtar tukuyäna.
Most of all, I love that.	Taqe kunat sipansa, uk nayajj walpun munta.
I turned down the opportunity.	Nayax uka oportunidad ukarux janiw sasaw arsuwayta.
Looks hot but we’ll see.	Uñtasi junt’u ukampis uñjañäni.
It’s a really good night.	Chiqpachansa mä suma arumaw.
Lovely, lovely place.	Munat, munat chiqa.
I know he’s a real person.	Nayax yattwa jupax chiqpach jaqiwa.
I want to know before I go.	Janïr sarkasajj yatiñ munta.
That was what scared them the most.	Ukaw jupanakar wal ajjsaräna.
That’s all we need.	Ukaw taqe kunas jiwasatak wakisi.
Much faster than he is.	Jupat sipansa jukʼamp jankʼakiw.
Very red.	Sinti wila.
Now he is a delight.	Jichhajj jupajj wali kusiskañawa.
He saw a heart.	Jupajj mä chuyma uñjäna.
But it happened very quickly.	Ukampis wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
No need to do anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns lurañajj wakiskiti.
This feels completely true.	Ukax taqpach chiqaw sasaw amuyasi.
He hit the ball well there.	Jupax ukanx wali sumaw pelot ch’allt’äna.
Not this morning.	Janiw jichha alwax utjkiti.
This was not the case in the past.	Nayrajj ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So of course he did.	Ukhamajj cheqapuniw jupajj uk luräna.
Of course, you say.	Chiqansa, jumax siwa.
They’re not like that for me.	Jupanakax janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He said he didn’t want to see her again tonight.	Jupax janiw jichha arumax wasitat uñjañ munkti sasaw säna.
Almost important.	Niya wali wakiskiriwa.
There was one of these.	Ukanjja, mä ukaw utjäna.
We are still .	Jiwasax wali .
He died a day later.	Jupajj mä uru qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
Just like he has it.	Kunjamtï jupajj utjki ukhama.
That was rare these days.	Ukax aka urunakanx juk’akiw utjäna.
Something remotely so interesting.	Kunas jaya chiqat ukham wali askïspawa.
There, he feels very comfortable.	Ukanjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
I saw the police.	Nayax policiaruw uñjta.
He gave her final advice.	Jupaw qhep qhepa ewjjtʼäna.
He looked like that.	Jupajj ukham uñnaqäna.
I think this is a really hard one.	Nayax amuyta akax chiqpachans mä ch’amawa.
He had nothing in him.	Jupajj janiw kunas jupan utjkänti.
No one really wants to say.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni sañ munkiti.
And he wants it badly.	Ukat jupax jan waliw uk muni.
It really doesn’t matter to him.	Chiqpachansa janiw juparux kuns lurkiti.
The weather leads to a wonderful winter.	Uka pachax wali muspharkañ juyphi pacharuw puri.
He got the biggest one.	Jupaw jukʼamp jachʼa katoqäna.
And you know who said that.	Ukat khitis ukham säna uk jumax yatisktawa.
He didn't really understand.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun amuyaskänti.
I don’t know that.	Nayax janiw uk yatkti.
I love how she did it.	Kunjamsa ukanak lurawayi uk walpun munasta.
Do what you do well.	Kuntï luraskta uk sum luram.
He can see for himself tomorrow.	Qhipürux jupa pachpaw uñjasispa.
This happened days ago.	Ukax urunak nayraw pasäna.
And he really meant it.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw uk sañ munäna.
What happened next .	Kunas uka qhepat pasäna .
But really, that’s your best bet.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
Very good film.	Wali suma película.
Just don't do it, she thought.	Ukhamajj jan luramti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Weird, but yeah.	Muspharkañawa, ukampis jïsa.
I’m kind of thinking.	Nayax mä juk’a amuyta.
I don't want to go to you.	Nayajj janiw jumar sarañ munkti.
But don't rush it.	Ukampis janiw jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
So the question is irrelevant.	Ukhamajj uka jisktʼajj janiw kunäkisa.
It was very shaky.	Ukajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
That’s exactly what he loves.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw juparux munasi.
The sooner the better.	Jankʼak lurasajj jukʼamp askiwa.
And it was doing that to him.	Ukat ukajj jupar ukham luraskäna.
That’s a beautiful place.	Uka mä suma chiqa.
It was a very painful experience.	Ukax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
There is an opportunity here.	Aka chiqanx mä oportunidad ukaw utji.
But then often you know.	Ukampis ukat walja kutix jumax yatisktawa.
I didn't understand it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw amuykayätti.
The time has just come.	Jichhakiw uka tiempojj purini.
I’m doing it all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw uk luraskta.
Surprisingly, it doesn’t.	Muspharkañawa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
It required action.	Ukatakejj lurañaw wakisïna.
You must never give up.	Janipuniw uk jaytañamäkiti.
Yes, you know that.	Jïsa, jumax uk yatisktawa.
But, you have to do everything.	Ukampis, jumajj taqe kunwa lurañama.
I hope he didn’t.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkänti sasaw suyt’ta.
I wish I could get out of it sooner.	Nayax ukat juk’amp jank’ak apsuñ munta.
At that time, he left for work.	Uka tiemponjja, irnaqäwir sarañatakiw sarjjäna.
Well it wasn’t, so .	Ukhamajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukhamajj .
He told them so.	Jupajj ukhamwa jupanakar säna.
Good heart, too.	Suma chuyma, ukhamaraki.
I never want to see you again.	Janipuniw mayamps jumar uñjañ munkti.
Breakfast is excellent.	Desayuno ukaxa wali sumawa.
The local man refused.	Uka markankir jaqejj janiw sasaw säna.
More than twenty, he thought.	Pä tunka jila, sasaw amuyäna.
And one day he plans to buy a house.	Ukat mä urux mä uta alañ amti.
That’s why he’s there.	Ukatwa jupax ukan jikxatasi.
There, I don't have it.	Ukanjja, janiw nayajj utjkituti.
I have no intention of doing this.	Nayajj janiw uk lurañ amtkti.
I think you like him.	Nayax amuyta, jumax juparux wali askiwa.
Too bad that wasn’t the case.	Wali jan waliw ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he couldn’t leave her.	Ukampis janiw jupar jaytañ puedkänti.
I don’t know why, I like everything.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.
It was so good, so good.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, wali sumapunïnwa.
I want to eat well.	Nayax wali sum manq’añ munta.
He shook it once.	Jupax mä kutiw ch’allxtayäna.
Anyone could have done that.	Khitis ukham luraspäna.
I went to see him last week.	Nayax pasïr semanaw jupar uñjir sarawayta.
But for everything he does, there’s a first.	Ukampis taqi kunatix luraski ukatakix nayrïr kutiw utji.
We didn't have that .	Jiwasajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
It worked immediately.	Ukajj jankʼakiw irnaqäna.
That’s a future.	Ukax mä jutïr.
No one has anything on him.	Janiw khitis juparux kunas utjkiti.
All of these were excellent or excellent.	Taqi ukanakax wali suma jan ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Janiw kunas, janiw kunas, janiw kunas utjkiti.
These will do well.	Ukanakajj sumwa lurani.
It’s all fun and interesting.	Taqi kunas kusiskañawa ukat wali askiwa.
He did it that morning.	Jupajj uka alwaw uk luräna.
Completely and utterly wrong.	Qʼala ukat qʼala jan walïki.
But it’s been around for years at this point.	Ukampis ukax walja maranakaw aka pachanx utji.
It hit everyone secretly .	Ukax taqiniruw jamasat ch'allt'äna .
He’s such a cute guy, really.	Jupax ukham munat jaqiwa, chiqpachansa.
He didn't do anything he didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jan munkäna uk lurkänti.
He wanted a car.	Jupajj mä auto munäna.
But that is always the case.	Ukampis ukajj sapa kutiw utji.
So there is no problem anywhere.	Ukhamajj janiw kawkhansa kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He said no to her.	Juparux janiw sasaw säna.
I’m so sorry, you know.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa, jumax yatisktawa.
That’s what you have here.	Ukaw jumanakan akan utji.
And he began to speak.	Ukat parlañ qalltäna.
He loved the place.	Jupajj uka cheqar walpun munasïna.
But don’t leave him alone.	Ukampis janiw jupar jaytañamäkiti.
I’m so excited, you know.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, jumax yatisktawa.
But one simple question.	Ukampis mä jisktʼajj wali chʼamakiwa.
Please tell us more.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp yatiyapjjeta.
These were much better.	Ukanakajj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
He immediately comes up with a new plan.	Ukat jankʼakiw mä machaq amtar puri.
I just, you know.	Nayax ukhamakiw, jumax yatisktawa.
Each time he struck higher.	Sapa kutiw juk’amp jach’a ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
I saw it for the first time on the plane.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw uka avión ukan uñjta.
And a good wine.	Ukat mä suma vino.
I tried my best.	Nayajj walpun chʼamachasiyäta.
He really didn’t care.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurkänti.
Yes, he said he understood.	Jïsa, uk sum amuyta sasaw säna.
But he did nothing to do so.	Ukampis uk lurañatakix janiw kuns lurkänti.
He wants to take the car.	Jupax auto apsuñ muni.
These are the	Ukanakajj .
Now he realized something was wrong.	Jichhajj kunas jan walïki uk amuyasïna.
Tell me the truth.	Chiqaw yatiyañama.
He stole food somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa manq’a lunthatasïna.
That made him feel good.	Ukaw jupar sum jikjjatasïna.
It was a quiet one.	Ukajj mä amukiw sarnaqäna.
I didn’t know how to do anything.	Janiw kunjamsa kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
To be honest, he felt the same way.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
He seemed unsure of what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk janis sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
No one really knew what it was.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kunas uk yatkänti.
He is more important .	Jupajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa .
No, there was nothing.	Janiwa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
A    .	MÄ .
He got here first.	Jupaw nayraqat aka cheqar purinïna.
No, he’s fine.	Janiwa, jupax walikïskiwa.
So that was the thing.	Ukhamajj ukajj ukhamänwa.
Actually, that was it.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ukhamänwa.
But tonight he didn't want to do that.	Ukampis jichha arumax janiw uk lurañ munkänti.
Or he thought he should.	Jan ukajj jupajj ukham lurañapawa sasaw amuyäna.
He has done good and bad things in the past.	Jupajj nayra tiemponjja, suma jan walinak lurawayi.
They have a lot of them.	Jupanakax walja ukanakaw utji.
So that doesn't work for me.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw nayatakejj askïkiti.
And he never liked it.	Ukat janipuniw juparux gustkänti.
But at least .	Ukampis mä jukʼa .
But that is where you all go!.	Ukampis ¡ukaruw jumanakajj taqenis sarapjjta!.
It’s a really big one out there.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a ukaw uka chiqanx utji.
How can one do this .	Kunjamsa mä jaqejj ukham luraspa .
He threw it all away.	Jupajj taqe ukanak jaqontäna.
And not the other way around.	Ukat janiw yaqha tuqitxa.
He’s had that silence until now.	Jupax jichhakamax uka amukiw jikxatasïna.
He died two weeks later.	Pä semana qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
He feels very strongly about it.	Uka tuqitxa jupax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
But there was no more time.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkänti.
I never wanted anything.	Janipuniw kunatsa munkayätti.
I don't really believe all that.	Nayajj janiw taqe ukanak cheqpachapun creykti.
There will be a day.	Uka urux mä uruw utjani.
He was abusing her.	Jupajj jupar jan walinak luraskäna.
Nothing more can be done.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkaspati.
He asked her something.	Jupajj kunsa jupar jisktʼäna.
Of course, there are.	Chiqpachansa, ukanakaw utji.
Not more or less.	Janiw juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
There is nothing in him.	Janiw kunas jupan utjkiti.
So it’s just that .	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw .
It’s the only thing they know very well.	Ukakiw jupanakax wali sum yatipxi.
Do nothing during that month.	Uka phaxsinx janiw kuns lurañamäkiti.
He has done much better.	Jupajj wal jukʼamp sum lurawayi.
It’s something you have when you want it.	Ukax mä kunaw kunapachatï munkta ukhax utji.

He is immediately better now.	Jichhajj jankʼakiw jupajj jukʼamp askejja.
People are the reason for everything.	Jaqinakax kunatsa taqi kunas utji.
So, here’s what that looks like.	Ukhama, akax kunjams ukax uñtasi.
He went swimming several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw umañar saräna.
The people are beautiful.	Jaqinakax wali sumawa.
He didn't like them any less.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa jupanakar jukʼamp munkänti.
They had no problem.	Jupanakajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
It was wonderful in one respect.	Mä tuqitxa wali sumapunïnwa.
Remember three things.	Kimsa lurañanak jan armasimti.
He says he knows nothing about it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit kuns yatkti sasaw saraki.
And in a much smaller way, .	Ukat mä jukʼamp jiskʼa toqetwa, .
No more coffee.	Janiw juk’ampi café utjkiti.
More and more, more and more.	Juk’ampi juk’ampi, juk’ampi juk’ampi.
Actually, it kind of works for me.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa nayatakix wali askiwa.
The crowd was overwhelmed.	Uka jaqenakajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He had always drawn strength from his work.	Jupajj nayratpachaw irnaqäwipat chʼam katoqäna.
He refused to share it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatiyañ munkänti.
And everyone knows it.	Ukat taqiniw yatipxi.
It was a very sad experience for me.	Nayatakejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I know exactly how.	Kunjamsa uk sum yatta.
Breakfast was really good.	Desayuno ukax chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
He said, she said.	Jupajj sänwa, sasaw jupajj säna.
I really think this is interesting.	Chiqpachansa akax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
It was very emotional.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
Well, someone knows something.	Ukhama, maynix kuns yati.
Because it’s still morning.	Kunatix wali alwaw.
And let me know.	Ukat yatiyapxita.
Maybe a little more or a little less.	Inas mä juk’a juk’ampi jan ukax mä juk’a juk’ampi.
So what is the reason for this?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunatsa ukajj utjaspa?.
That was pretty cool, too.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, ukhamaraki.
Why did he decide to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ amtäna.
You feel bad about it.	Uka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatasïta.
But something had to be done.	Ukampis kunas lurañaw wakisïna.
I started doing well there.	Ukan sum lurañ qalltawayta.
I know a little bit.	Nayax yattwa mä juk’a.
But he didn’t really want to.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun munkänti.
You used to be someone.	Jumax nayrax khitirus jaqïtawa.
It’s very quiet here.	Aka chiqanx wali amukiw jikxatasi.
Anyway, that’s what happened.	Kawkhansa, ukax ukhamaw pasäna.

I think he’s one of them.	Nayax amuyta, jupax mayniw sasaw amuyta.

He did not do well at home.	Jupajj janiw utan sum lurkänti.
It just goes like this.	Ukax ukhamakiw sarxi.
I didn’t have to go there again.	Janiw mayamp uka chiqar sarañax wakiskänti.

I need to do these things.	Nayax ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
I’m looking for all of these.	Nayax taqi ukanak thaqhaskta.
It’s still inside.	Wali manqhan jikxatasi.
Of course, it doesn’t matter.	Chiqansa, janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He decided to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk lurañ amtäna.
And that’s exactly what it means.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw ukax sañ muni.
Anyway, that’s right.	Kawkhansa, ukhamawa.
He spoke in a strong voice.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw arsüna.
And he didn't do anything.	Ukat janiw kuns lurkänti.
And he really doesn't know what to do with me.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kunsa nayamp lurañap yatkiti.
He’s really quite unusual.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali jan uñt’atawa.
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Inas jan utjkaspati.
But when he did, he didn't say so.	Ukampis ukham luräna ukhajja, janiw ukham siskänti.
I am doing exactly what I have always done.	Nayajj kunjamtï nayrajj lurkta ukhamarakiw luraskta.
But he must do what he set out to do.	Ukampis kuntï lurañ amtkäna uk lurañapawa.
And, you know, that would be good.	Ukat, jumax yatisktawa, ukax wali askïspawa.
You know something, she thought.	Jumax kuns yatta, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Of course the point is quite clear.	Chiqansa uka tuqitxa wali qhanawa.
It felt good, that’s all.	Wali sumaw jikxatasïna, ukakiw.
These last all day.	Ukanakax urunakpachaw utji.

I feel that way .	Nayax ukham amuyasta .
He would never do anything about it.	Jupajj janipuniw uka toqet kuns lurkaspänti.
He loved her even more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jupar munasïna.
Maybe this whole thing needs to be done.	Inas aka taqpach lurañax wakischispa.
I really didn’t want to get into it.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukar mantañ munkayätti.
I think yes it is.	Nayax amuyta jïsa ukax ukhamawa.
Surprisingly so, too.	Muspharkañawa ukhama, ukhamaraki.
But my own self.	Ukampis nayan pachpa.
And very, very strange.	Ukat wali, wali muspharkañawa.
He knows that now.	Jupajj uk jichhajj sum yati.
He’s doing a good job.	Jupax mä suma irnaqäw luraski.
But, a year later, he moved back.	Ukampis, mä mara qhepatjja, wasitatwa uka markar sarjjäna.
It’s happened a lot lately.	Aka qhipa urunakanx walpun pasäna.
And what can happen and what can happen.	Ukat kunas pasaspa ukat kunas pasaspa.
I think we all should.	Nayax amuyta taqiniw ukham lurañasa.
This was not the case before at all.	Ukajj janiw nayrajj kunjamatsa utjkänti.
He was always successful.	Jupajj sapa kutiw sum jakasïna.
Everything works for me now.	Jichhax taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.
And he wanted nothing but that.	Ukat janiw kuns munkänti, jan ukasti ukakiw munasïna.
But it is not so,	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, .
Avoid it when you can.	Kunapachatï lurañjamäki ukhajja, janiw uk lurañamäkiti.
He wanted to know everything.	Jupajj taqe kun yatiñwa munäna.
Who's who.	Khitis khitis.
What did he say.	Kunsa jupax säna.
Very not very impressive.	Wali jan sinti muspharkañawa.
Actually, he’s a good guy.	Chiqansa, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
We’ll see when we see.	Uñjañäni ukhaw uñjañäni.
He agreed to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañatakiw iyaw säna.
I never wanted to get into it.	Janipuniw ukar mantañ munkti.
So exciting, but weird at the same time.	Ukhamajj wali kusiskañawa, ukampis pachpa tiempon muspharkañawa.
He loves to stay.	Jupajj qheparañ wal muni.
What you do next is important.	Uka qhepat kuntï lurkta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
That doesn't mean we should.	Ukajj janiw uk lurañasa sañ munkiti.
He spent the whole night in the city.	Taqi arumaw uka markan sarnaqäna.
It shouldn’t be done.	Janiw lurañapäkiti.
They never know.	Jupanakax janipuniw yatipkiti.
I want to talk about that a little bit.	Uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa parltʼañ munta.
Someone knows where you are.	Maynix kawkhans jikxatasi uk yati.
He was never without.	Jupajj janipuniw jan ukajj utjkänti.
The person is nothing.	Jaqix janiw kunäkisa.
I worry about what he will do.	Kuntï jupajj lurani uka toqet llakistwa.
Or at least something like that.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa ukhama.
He doesn’t want to know anywhere.	Jupax janiw kawkirus yatiñ munkiti.
You know this is important to you.	Jumax yatisktawa akax jumatakix wakiskiriwa.
What is he supposed to do? 	¿Kunsa jupajj lurañapa?
We are individuals all the time, all the time.	Jiwasax sapa mayniw sapa kuti, taqi pachan.
In fact, that’s really all it used to be.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa ukakiw nayrax utjäna.
But there is no need to do anything wrong.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas wakiskiti.
And yes, it’s delicious.	Ukat jïsa, wali sumawa.
There is myself, and .	Ukanjja, naya pachpaw utji, ukat .
He stared at her for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow uñchʼukiskäna.

Of course, if you want.	Chiqansa, jumax munsta ukhaxa.
I wasn't sure what to do.	Kunsa lurañasa uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
I definitely think there’s something there.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukanx kunas utji sasaw amuyta.
And again yesterday.	Ukat wasitat qharüru.
It was obviously unoccupied.	Ukanjja, janiw jaqejj utjkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Something happened every night.	Sapa arumaw kunas pasäna.
But that's all he did.	Ukampis ukakiw jupajj luräna.
It doesn’t matter, .	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, .
It takes about an hour.	Ukatakejj niya mä horaw sarañapa.
Of course he told me no.	Chiqansa jupax janiw sasaw sitäna.
She gave him coffee.	Juparux café churäna.
He doesn't even want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañsa munkiti.
I wonder when that will happen.	Kunapachas ukajj pasani sasaw jisktʼasta.
I always want it.	Nayax sapa kutiw munta.
But, you can do it yourself.	Ukampis, juma pachpaw lurasma.
For this, later before .	Ukatakejj qhepat janïr .
He’s been there all day.	Jupax urunakpachaw ukan jikxatasïna.
I don't need someone like you.	Nayajj janiw jumar uñtasit jaqejj munaskiti.
He has been gone for two weeks.	Jupajj pä semanaw jan sarkiti.
It doesn’t take any time.	Janiw kuna tiempos munaskiti.
Anyway, you know what it is.	Kawkhansa, jumax yatisktawa kunas ukax.
There is no time here.	Janiw kuna pachas akan utjkiti.
Now I had to do it.	Jichhajj uk lurañaw wakisïna.

I didn’t say anything on the phone.	Janiw telefonot kuns siskti.

He thanked me for it.	Jupajj nayaruw yuspärta.
It looks very lovely.	Wali munasiñampiw uñtasi.
And that’s something you have to do.	Ukat ukax mä kunaw lurañama.
Didn’t get much sleep last night.	Janiw qhipa arumax sinti ikiñ jikxatkti.
He called a few hours ago.	Mä qawqha horanak nayraw jawsäna.
I'm sure it's true.	Nayajj cheqapuniw sista.
We don't have to do that.	Janiw jiwasajj ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
No, it doesn't matter.	Janiwa, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
It was very useful, it was.	Wali askiwa, ukhamawa.
Lunch lasted an hour.	Chika uru manq’añax mä horaw utjäna.
He was alone, as usual.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna, kunjamtï nayrax luraskäna ukhama.
It’s got a lot of energy.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
I will never do that.	Janipuniw uk lurkäti.
It felt wrong, somehow.	Jan waliw amuyasïna, kunjamatsa.
He’s not good enough for that.	Jupax janiw ukatakix askïkiti.
Here’s how you can do it.	Akax kunjams lurasma uk uñjañäni.
He died of his own accord.	Jupa pachpaw jiwjjäna.
I feel the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasta.
Like he said, no.	Kunjamtï siskäna ukhama, janiw.
This morning was a morning.	Jichha alwajj mä alwaw utjäna.

Whatever happens will happen.	Kunas utjani ukajj utjani.

He drinks a lot of coffee.	Jupax walja café umañ muni.
He was eager to help out at all costs.	Jupajj jan kunatsa yanaptʼañ wal munäna.
I ordered a ride.	Nayajj mä autot sarañatakiw mayïna.
No one will do it twice.	Janiw khitis pä kuti ukham lurkaniti.
That won't be there.	Ukajj janiw utjkaniti.
This is even more surprising.	Ukajj jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
I don’t have the money right now.	Nayax janiw jichhax uka qullqix utjkituti.
I can't find an argument for that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw mä arsuñ jikxatkti.
Or that big of a deal.	Jan ukajj ukham jachʼa.
There was no house and I didn’t have one.	Janiw utax utjkänti ukat nayax janiw utjkänti.
It totally sucked.	Ukax taqpach chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
In fact, you know, you’re a good teacher.	Chiqansa, jumax yatisktawa, jumax mä suma yatichiriwa.
Overall, the night was clear.	Taqi kunat sipansa, arumax qhanaw jikxatasïna.
He went to school a lot.	Jupajj walpun escuelar saräna.
It was something more original.	Ukajj jukʼamp nayrïr kunaw utjäna.
It was such a long time.	Ukham jaya tiempow pasäna.
To her surprise, she received a phone call a few days later.	Ukat mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa telefonot jawsäna, ukajj wal muspharäna.
I’m really excited for that.	Chiqpachansa ukatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Still not sure why there were so many people.	Wali jan sum yatkayätti kunatsa walja jaqenakajj utjäna.
But you don't have to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañamäkiti.
I think it was pretty good.	Nayax wali sumapunïnwa sasaw amuyta.
But so far that’s all they know.	Ukampis jichhakamax ukakiw jupanakax yatipxi.
But no he didn't say no.	Ukampis janiw jupajj janiw siskänti.
He really wants to do things right.	Chiqpachansa, kunsa sum lurañ muni.
He sat up comfortably.	Jupajj wali sumwa qontʼasïna.
It would be better now.	Jichhax juk’amp askïspawa.
He died a year later.	Mä mara qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
It looks very heavy.	Ukax wali llamp’u uñtatawa.
A snowflake like a snowflake.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi ukham ch’uqi ch’uqi.

He called her again.	Jupax wasitatwa jawsäna.

That was the problem.	Ukaw jan waltʼäwejj pasäna.

He went through this.	Jupajj aka toqetwa sarnaqäna.
It shouldn’t do anything.	Janiw kuns lurañapäkiti.
No one can say that.	Janiw khitis sañjamäkiti.
I thought he already knew.	Jupajj nayratpach yatkaspa ukhamwa amuyayäta.
He expected it.	Jupajj uk suyäna.
This is a little word.	Aka jisk’a aru.
And this is what stands out in this room.	Ukat akax aka cuarto ukanx wali uñt’atawa.
No, it can’t be that way.	Janiwa, janiw ukham utjkaspati.
We’re going to be very happy.	Jiwasax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
That's what he asked.	Ukaw jupajj jisktʼäna.

He looked harder now.	Jupax jichhax juk’amp ch’amampiw uñnaqäna.
But something can happen.	Ukampis kunas pasaspa.
Honestly, I never mean anything.	Chiqpachansa, janipuniw kunas sañ munkti.
I made a promise to myself that day.	Uka urux naya pachpaw mä arsuwayta.
I hope this time is good for you.	Nayax aka kutix jumatakix wali askiwa.

That’s okay for now.	Ukax jichhax walikïskiwa.
That is what he wants to know.	Ukaw jupajj yatiñ muni.
In the present day,	Jichha tiemponjja, .
He wondered how much time he had.	Qhawqha tiempos utjitu sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But you should never do that.	Ukampis janipuniw uk lurañamäkiti.
He didn't know the best words.	Jupajj wali suma arunak jan yatkänti.
But he couldn't do anything about it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
I want to do great things, really great things.	Nayax jach’a lurañanak lurañ munta, chiqpach jach’a lurañanak lurañ munta.

It looks great as a gift.	Mä regalo ukham wali suma uñtatawa.
No one wants to make a decision.	Janiw khitis mä amtar puriñ munkiti.
He just does it .	Jupax ukhamakiw luraski .
I come here all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw akan jutta.
I clearly understood.	Nayajj qhanaw amuyayäta.
Why this was the place.	Kunatsa akax uka chiqanx utjäna.
Now he was outside a university.	Jichhax mä jach’a yatiqañ utan anqan jikxatasïna.
Or a year.	Jan ukajj mä mara.
A safe bedroom.	Mä jan kuna jan waltʼäwin ikiñ uta.
I wonder how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
Never the other way around.	Janipuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
One day, one day.	Mä uru, mä uru.
I don’t know what to say about it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit kuns sañ yatkti.

I don't remember much of anything after that.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kunatsa wal amtaskti.
He knew the truth about himself.	Jupajj kunatï jupat cheqäki uk sum yatïna.
How do you feel about all of this?.	¿Kunjamsa jumajj taqe ukanak uñjasajj jikjjatasta?.
But he meant it.	Ukampis uk sañ munäna.

It’s really nothing like that.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.

I am very grateful to them.	Jupanakar walpun yuspärta.
Someone left it here.	Maynix akan jaytawayi.

You know how he felt.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams jupax jikxatasïna.
But it wasn’t inside.	Ukampis janiw manqhan utjkänti.
But he didn't say it well.	Ukampis janiw sum arskänti.
He was surprised several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw muspharäna.
I am more concerned than you are.	Nayax jumanakat sipansa jukʼamp llakistwa.
But now he sat there in silence.	Ukampis jichhajj amukiw ukan qontʼasïna.
I know everything about it.	Nayax taqi kun yattwa.
You have to push yourself too hard.	Juma pachpaw sinti chʼamachasiñama.

Of course, you don’t have to do all of that.	Chiqansa, janiw taqi ukanak lurañax wakiskiti.

I didn't do anything myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw kuns lurkti.

They really know everything.	Chiqpachansa taqi kun yatipxi.
I didn't know what to do about it.	Uka toqet kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.

But somewhere he saw her.	Ukampis kawkhansa jupar uñjäna.
It was never necessary.	Janipuniw wakiskänti.
And he’s right about it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
Things seem impossible.	Kunanakas jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw uñjasi.
I don't know exactly when he left.	Kunapachas sarjjäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
He was really nice and friendly about it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet wali suma ukat suma jaqënwa.

He knows someone will move soon.	Jupax yatiw maynix jank’akiw yaqha chiqar sarxani.
But no more baseball baseball.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp béisbol béisbol utjkänti.
Almost a stranger.	Niya mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
That’s exactly what was needed.	Uka pachpaw wakisïna.
What are we supposed to do.	¿Kunsa jiwasajj lurañasa.
I went alone.	Naya sapakiw sarawayta.
But it’s really fun .	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa .
He looks like such a little guy.	Jupax ukham jisk’a jaqir uñtatawa.

Or has done so.	Jan ukajj ukham lurawayi.

Too much room.	Sinti walja cuarto.

He’s left her.	Jupax juparux jaytawayi.
He thought he would be better suited for it.	Ukatakejj jupajj jukʼamp askïspawa sasaw amuyäna.
It seems very stupid to me.	Nayatakix wali llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
I don't know why anyone would do that.	Kunatsa khitis ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkti.
He talked a lot about you.	Jupajj jumanakat wal parläna.
He started working on it.	Uka tuqitxa irnaqañ qalltäna.
He found himself .	Jupa pachpaw jikjjatasïna .
Somehow, he didn’t think so.	Kunjamatsa, jupax janiw ukham amuykänti.
I want to do it tonight.	Jichha arumax lurañ munta.

And after that .	Ukat uka qhepatjja .

It’s interesting that there’s nothing there.	Ukax wali askiwa, janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
He thought it would do great.	Jach’a lurañanak lurani sasaw amuyäna.
And after he agreed, she said.	Ukat iyaw säna uka qhepatjja, jupajj sänwa.
I will go and see him immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw jupar uñjir sarä.

Let us make a contribution there.	Ukanjja, mä yanaptʼa lurañäni.
He felt the same way.	Jupax ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.

And, of course, it was.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ukhamänwa.

We have to do it quickly.	Jiwasax jank’akiw lurañasa.
The little snowflakes.	Uka jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He didn't want to go out.	Jupajj janiw mistuñ munkänti.
So it doesn't do anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns lurkiti.
Well obviously, this time it wasn’t.	Suma qhanawa, aka kutix janiw ukhamäkänti.
I want both at the same time.	Nayax panpachaniw mä pachan munta.
It is better to do what is right.	Kunatï walïki uk lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
Another exciting day.	Yaqha urux wali kusiskañawa.
So he got what he wanted.	Ukhamajj kuntï munkäna uk katoqäna.
I appreciate all of this.	Taqe ukanak wali askit uñjta.
And it’s always worth it.	Ukat sapa kutiw ukax wali askiwa.
I’m sorry, actually.	Nayax llakistwa, chiqpachansa.
You are a beautiful light.	Jumax mä suma qhanawa.
He didn't want to talk well.	Jupajj janiw sum parlañ munkänti.
When he didn't, he did.	Kunapachatï jan lurkäna ukhajja, jupaw luräna.
So weird but so exciting.	Ukhama muspharkañ ukampis wali kusiskañawa.
He didn't want to eat at all.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa manqʼañ munkänti.
He’s waiting for you.	Jupax suyt’aski.
But he never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw uk lurkänti.
Now there are two things to do.	Jichhax pä lurañaw utji.
So that's weird.	Ukhamajj ukajj muspharkañawa.
Winter is hard, still.	Juyphi pachax ch’amawa, wali.
At that time, somehow.	Uka tiemponjja, kunjamatsa.
Everything was in some sense.	Taqi kunas mä juk’a amuyumpiw utjäna.
I know that this is often not the case.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti, uk sum yatta.
After a few days, do so.	Mä qhawqha urunak qhepatjja, ukham lurañamawa.
So don't give up.	Ukhamajj janiw jaytañamäkiti.
I’m just as concerned.	Nayax ukhamarakiw llakista.
He was a great villain, after all.	Jupajj mä jachʼa jan wali jaqënwa, taqe kunat sipansa.
Who is he.	Khitis jupax.
He didn't have that.	Jupajj janiw ukham utjkänti.
I’ve never seen it all that much.	Janipuniw ukham taqpach uñjkti.
Three days of that.	Kimsa uruw ukat.
It does not want or need more money.	Janiw jukʼamp qollqe munkiti ni munaskiti.
Everything is quiet and still.	Taqi kunas amukiw ukat wali ch’amawa.
He’s done exactly that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayi.
But it is the.	Ukampis ukajj uka...
It really means a lot!.	¡Chiqpachansa walpun sañ muni!.
Every day, really.	Sapa uru, chiqpachansa.
And no, that’s not the reason.	Ukat janiwa, janiw ukax kunatsa ukhamäkiti.
I want to know how to go about it.	Nayax kunjams uka tuqit sarañax uk yatiñ munta.
He doesn’t know how.	Jupax kunjamatsa uk janiw yatkiti.
He was happy here.	Jupajj akan kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He loves you, you know.	Jupax jumarux wali munasiñampiw uñji, jumax yatisktawa.
I was so shaken up.	Nayajj walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He, too, moved abroad.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw yaqha markar sarjjäna.
. . . .	.
He said he wanted to see you.	Jumaruw uñjañ munta sasaw säna.
Something like him.	Jupar uñtasit kunas.
In the case of the moon, of course.	Phaxsin tuqitxa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
Rather awesome really.	Jan ukasti wali muspharkañawa chiqpachansa.
Yes, that can happen to you.	Jïsa, ukajj jumamp chikaw utjaspa.
It’s clear now, of course.	Jichhax qhanaw amuyasi, chiqpachansa.
Another night maybe.	Yaqha arumax inas.
Now it’s with me all the time.	Jichhax nayamp chikaw taqi pachaw utji.
I love them now.	Jichhajj jupanakar walpun munasta.
But let’s do it at home.	Ukampis utan lurañäni.
He says the following.	Jupax akham sasaw arsu.
You never say why.	Jumax janipuniw kunatsa ukham sista.
I know what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk sum yatta.
Do it or don't do it.	Uk luram jan ukajj jan luramti.
That’s a room.	Ukax mä cuarto.
He 's the one	Jupaw uk luri .
But I have no idea what the problem is.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk janiw amuykti.
It has nothing to do with it .	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti .
And you .	Ukat jumax .
He wanted to learn how to play the guitar.	Jupajj guitarra tocañ yatiñwa munäna.
Just another house.	Ukhama yaqha uta.
Something like that, somehow.	Kunas ukham, kunjamatsa.
He knew everything about her.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupat yatïna.
But then I kind of .	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, mä jukʼa .
A few days ago.	Mä qawqha urunak nayrax.
Which, as he says.	Ukaxa, kunjamtï jupax siski ukhama.
Not much else !.	Janiw juk'ampi !.
All of this is important, of course.	Taqi ukanakax wali wakiskiriwa, chiqpachansa.
But he never did that night.	Ukampis uka arumax janipuniw uk lurkänti.
He looked worried again.	Jupax wasitat llakitaw uñnaqäna.
He didn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns munkänti.
This took two years.	Ukatakejj pä maraw munasïna.
He rarely saw her like that.	Jupajj ukham jukʼakiw jupar uñjäna.
I don’t often get anything.	Janiw walja kutix kuns jikxatkti.
I'm saying the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw sista.
This is always a great party.	Akax sapa kutiw mä jach’a fiesta.
If there is anything .	Ukax kunas utjaspa ukhaxa .
These are not necessary.	Ukanakajj janiw wakiskiti.
What could be the result? 	¿Kunsa ukajj utjaspa?
Cracks all over the place.	Taqi chiqan ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
If you feel like you want to.	Jumatix munkta ukham amuyasta ukhaxa.
Consider what he did.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk uñjañäni.
It happened a couple of times.	Mä pä kutiw ukham pasäna.
But he was very quiet.	Ukampis wali amukiw sarnaqäna.
At least once a month.	Phaxsin mä kutis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I really didn’t expect that from you.	Chiqpachansa janiw jumanakat ukham suykayätti.
So now , . . . .	Ukhamajj jichhajj .
But no no it’s not.	Ukampis janiw janiw janiw ukhamäkiti.
They don't know about it.	Jupanakajj janiw uka toqet yatipkiti.
So it was pretty good .	Ukhamajj wali sumapunïnwa .
That did something to him.	Ukaw jupar kuns luräna.
Do some homework.	Mä juk’a tareanak lurañamawa.
Now, nobody knows.	Jichhax, janiw khitis yatkiti.
No one wanted to disagree.	Janiw khitis jan iyaw sañ munkänti.
Don’t leave him alone.	Janiw sapak jaytañamäkiti.
Everything is not necessary.	Taqi kunas janiw wakiskiti.
I used to be surprised.	Nayrajj wal muspharta.
There is no time now.	Jichhax janiw pachax utjkiti.
And that makes me very happy.	Ukat ukajj nayatakejj wali kusiskañawa.
I know he’s happy.	Nayax yattwa jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi.
This is really weird again.	Akax chiqpachans wasitat muspharkañawa.
Except he wouldn't exist.	Jan ukasti janiw jupajj utjkaspati.
In fact, there was nothing.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
They are definitely worth the money.	Jupanakax chiqpachapuniw qullqix wali askiwa.
Let's see how it improves.	Kunjamsa jukʼamp sum luraski uk uñjañäni.
Himself and myself, himself and myself.	Jupa pachpa ukat naya pachpa, jupa pachpa ukat naya pachpa.
You can do that with me.	Jumax nayamp chikaw ukham lurasma.
If he knew that.	Jupajj uk yatïna ukhajja.
And for that I am very grateful.	Ukat ukat wal yuspärta.
It started out badly.	Jan waliw qalltäna.
Don’t be like him.	Janiw jupar uñtasit lurañamäkiti.
And it’s still summer.	Ukat wali sumaw verano.
Once, a month.	Mä kutix, phaxsinx.
What does it mean to me.	Kunsa nayatakejj sañ muni.
About a year, a little more.	Niya mä mara, mä juk’a juk’ampi.
They need to do that.	Jupanakajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
He loves it there.	Jupajj ukan wal munasi.
That’s how bad it felt.	Ukhamaw jan walin jikxatasïna.
I said he did that.	Nayax jupax ukham luratayna sasaw sista.
I didn’t know otherwise.	Nayax janiw yaqha tuqit yatkayätti.
You know how you feel.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjamsa jikxatasïta.
People don’t have to do that.	Jaqinakax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Let’s see if you can do it!.	¡Uk lurasmati janicha uk uñjañäni!.
Tonight is a night.	Jichha arumax mä arumaw.
I think that’s pretty cool.	Nayax ukax wali sumaw sasaw amuyta.
He saw his first home.	Nayrïr utap uñjäna.
He said goodnight.	Jupaw suma arumax säna.
I’ve always done that.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukham lurawayta.
After that, it went faster.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Nobody likes him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkituti.
But he came alone.	Ukampis jupa sapakiw jutäna.
A single red snowflake.	Mä sapa wila ch’uqi.
But now it doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa.
It was that tall and thin man.	Ukajj uka jachʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqënwa.
He died thirty years ago.	Jupajj kimsa tunka mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
At the moment, he didn't like that.	Jichha tiemponjja, janiw ukajj jupar gustkänti.
He said that somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa ukham säna.
I mean that person.	Nayax uka jaqiruw sañ munta.
I seem to be old.	Nayax chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
I want my own things.	Naya pachpaw kunanaktï munkta ukanak munta.
I quietly like it.	Nayatakix amukiw ukax wali askiwa.
Now he joined her for the ride.	Jichhax jupax uka kayuk sarañatakix jupamp chikaw sarxäna.
But, at least .	Ukampis, mä jukʼa .
I want to see what’s next.	Kunas jutïrin utjani uk uñjañ munta.
Better not to do it.	Jan lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
What he was feeling.	Kunsa jupajj jikjjatasïna.
It did, and well.	Ukham luratayna, ukat wali suma.
So why is it .	Ukhamajj kunatsa .
The new big guys aren’t any better.	Machaq jach’a jaqinakax janiw juk’amp askïkiti.
I think it was about me.	Nayax amuyta, nayat ukhamänwa.
It will last a long time.	Ukajj jaya tiempow utjani.
I don't do it anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp uk lurkti.
Everything looks great now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali suma uñtatawa.
He never liked it much.	Janipuniw juparux sinti gustkänti.
But he asked if it was all right.	Ukampis walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼäna.
I’m still saying that.	Nayax waliw sasaw sista.
He has done this before.	Jupajj nayraw ukham lurawayi.
Or so he says.	Jan ukajj ukham siwa.
That’s really, really, all there is to it.	Ukax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa, taqi kunatix utjki ukawa.
Not the whole thing.	Janiw taqpach tuqitxa.
Last night last.	Qhipa arumax qhipürux.
He was already in you.	Jupajj niyaw jumanakan utjäna.
Everything was found there.	Taqi kunas ukan jikxatasïna.
Maybe someone bought his house.	Inas khitis utap alasïna.
He saw something there.	Ukan kuns uñjäna.
He stayed overnight.	Jupajj mä arumaw qheparäna.
Something very bad could happen to him.	Kunas wali jan waliw jupar pasaspa.
He doesn't know much about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkiti.
It’s a little difficult.	Mä juk’a ch’amawa.
Harder, softer, better.	Juk’ampi qala, juk’ampi llamp’u, juk’ampi suma.
New money is always available.	Machaq qullqix sapa kutiw utji.
How long this all lasted, no one knew.	Qhawqha tiempos taqe ukajj utjäna, janiw khitis yatkänti.
I had a lot of fun, and I was busy.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, ukat jan tiemponiw jikxatasiyäta.
Now they have this.	Jichhax jupanakax aka...
Difficult, but not impossible.	Chʼamakiwa, ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
And ultimately, I liked it.	Ukat qhepatjja, nayaruw gustitu.
He didn't do anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurkänti.
Yeah, the first time.	Jïsa, nayrïr kuti.
This is the school	Aka yatiqañ utax .
I had one last week.	Nayax mä pasïr semanaw utjäna.
I neither believe nor disbelieve.	Nayajj janiw creykti ni jan creykti.
But that is obvious.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw uñjasi.
It’s going really well.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali sum saraski.
This happened the other night.	Ukhamaw yaqha arumax pasäna.
And that’s just wrong.	Ukat ukax jan walikïskiwa.
I didn’t quite know what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa sum yatkayätti.
And one room and two rooms.	Ukat mä cuarto ukat pä cuarto.
He speaks a little too quickly.	Jupax mä juk’a sinti jank’akiw arsu.
But there was silence.	Ukampis amukiw utjäna.
No bedtime, no reason to sleep.	Janiw ikiñ pachax utjkänti, janiw kuna razonas ikiñan utjkänti.
He never knew why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
He’s having a great time.	Jupax mä jach’a pachan sarnaqaski.
Both of those were here.	Uka panpachaniw akan utjäna.
He was curious about you.	Jupajj jumat wal yatiñ munäna.
But one can’t have everything.	Ukampis maynix janiw taqi kunas utjkaspati.
But that's not the right thing to do.	Ukampis ukajj janiw askïkiti.
Of course, he wants to do that.	Chiqansa, jupax ukham lurañwa muni.
I came to them.	Nayajj jupanakar jutta.
I hope to do better on that next year.	Nayax jutir marax uka tuqit juk’amp sum lurañ suyt’askta.
But what is this .	Ukampis kunas aka .
That seemed silly now.	Ukax jichhax llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
A night at home needs a quiet night.	Utan mä arumax mä llamp’u arumaw wakisi.
He went away on his own.	Jupa pachpaw sarjjäna.
The guy really got over it.	Uka waynax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitx jikxatasïna.
The day came a little too soon.	Uka urux mä juk’a jank’akiw purini.
Much better than he is.	Jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.
You have both of them.	Panpachaniw jumanakan utji.
He hoped to know better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yatiñwa suyäna.
But then again, it doesn't.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to see it.	Jupajj uk uñjañ wal munäna.
He didn't understand all of this.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanak amuykänti.
But he saw it done.	Ukampis uk lurir uñjäna.
He always came through.	Jupax sapa kutiw uka tuqit jutäna.
It’s a bit of a snowflake.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
We’ll do it again tomorrow.	Qhipürux wasitat lurañäni.
Didn't think it was possible.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakisispa sasin amuykänti.
The money will come to you.	Qullqix jumaruw purini.
I think nobody does.	Nayax amuyta, janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
I think that is a really good thing.	Ukajj cheqpachapun wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
I decided to go swimming.	Nayax umañar sarañ amtawayta.
He did not know how long it had been.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He sees what’s going on.	Jupax kunatix utjki uk uñji.
I did that today.	Jichhüruw ukham lurawayta.
One morning he left very quickly.	Mä alwajj wali jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Nothing serious to say.	Janiw kunas wali jach’a sañjamäkiti.
Something wrong, something wrong.	Kunas jan wali, kuna jan wali.
But that was clearly not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He died three days later.	Kimsa uru qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
It doesn’t need to go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarañatak wakiskiti.
He bought time.	Jupajj tiempo alasïna.
And she’s a woman.	Ukat jupax mä warmiwa.
It doesn’t, moreover, get done.	Janiw, juk’ampi, lurañax utjkiti.
I want to get into it.	Nayajj ukaruw mantañ munta.
Or is it a ? 	¿Jan ukax?
That was the first one.	Ukaw nayraqat utjäna.
He didn't say a thing.	Jupajj janiw mä kunsa arskänti.
It took him even longer.	Ukat jukʼamp tiempow jupar pasäna.
He did that, once.	Jupax ukham luratayna, mä kutix.
Everything looks good.	Taqi kunas sum uñtatawa.
But so far it is.	Ukampis jichhakamajj ukhamawa.
Of course, it is readily available.	Chiqansa, jankʼakiw jikxatasi.
He doesn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He immediately declined.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk jan säna.
Can’t do it here.	Janiw akan lurañjamäkiti.
I just told him that.	Nayax juparux ukhamakiw sista.
A little .	Mä juk'a .
I told him he certainly could.	Nayax juparux chiqpachansa luraspawa sasaw sista.
He understood all of this very well.	Jupajj taqe ukanakat wali sumwa amuyasïna.
Do whatever you want! 	¡Kuntï munkta uk luram!
I'm still not about that.	Nayax wali jan uka tuqitxa.
He’s feeling pretty good.	Jupax wali sum jikxatasi.
I think they know what to do.	Nayax amuyta, jupanakax kuntix lurañax uk yatipxi.
Pretty much as you’d expect.	Niya kunjamtï jumax suykayäta ukhama.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa janiw yatkänti.
I think I’ll need it soon.	Nayax amuyta, jank’akiw ukax munasini.
This is really amazing.	Chiqpachansa akax muspharkañawa.
Honestly, that’s what I like.	Chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
You think you’re right.	Jumax chiqaw sasaw amuyta.
It’s a little warm.	Mä juk’a junt’u.
Now I won't do anything wrong.	Jichhajj jan nayajj jan wal lurkäti.
It’s still very difficult.	Wali ch’amawa wali ch’amawa.
He will make his own name.	Jupax pachpa sutip lurani.
He knew a little better.	Mä jukʼa sum yatïna.
You look fierce.	Jumax wali qhuru uñnaqaniwa.
I want to eat there.	Nayax ukan manq’añ munta.
But it’s really funny.	Ukampis chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
The weather was perfect and the people were wonderful.	Pachax wali sumapunïnwa ukat jaqinakax wali sumapunïnwa.
I’m fine with that house.	Nayax uka utax walikïskiwa.
He did not know how long it had been.	Uka tiempojj qhawqha tiempos pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
He was a fierce little man.	Jupajj wali qhuru jiskʼa jaqënwa.
But it doesn’t do much.	Ukampis janiw wal lurkiti.
It’s good for anyone.	Ukax khitirus wali askiwa.
He doesn’t like that.	Jupax janiw ukax askïkiti.
The last time he did, someone died.	Qhep qhepa kutin ukham lurkäna ukhajja, mayniw jiwjjäna.
It sounds cool, but it really isn’t.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He lived in silence .	Jupajj amukiw jakasïna .
It would do no real harm.	Ukajj janiw cheqpach jan walinak lurkaspänti.
I refused again.	Nayajj wasitatwa nayajj jan munkti.
He has everything here.	Jupax taqi kunaw akan utji.
No one knew anything for sure.	Janiw khitis kuns sum yatkänti.
Let us do what you say.	Kuntï jumajj siskta uk lurañäni.
I really can’t make this stuff up.	Chiqpachansa janiw aka yänak lurañjamäkiti.
He struck again.	Jupax wasitatwa ch’allt’äna.
I think that’s hard.	Nayax amuyta ukax ch’amawa.
It will arrive tomorrow.	Ukax qharüruw purini.
You don’t want to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañ munktati.
But now it seemed necessary.	Ukampis jichhajj ukham lurañajj wakisispa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
A lot of this can happen in a short amount of time.	Mä jukʼa tiemponjja, walja ukanakaw pasaspa.
He gave me a house.	Jupaw mä uta churitu.
But every day was the same.	Ukampis sapa uruw nayrjam sarnaqäna.
I think he really loves this.	Nayax amuyta jupax chiqpachans akax walpun munasi.
Or with anyone else.	Jan ukax khitimpis.
I was still enjoying myself.	Wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Doesn’t want to eat anything, alone.	Janiwa kunsa manq’añ munkiti, sapaki.
That’s a lot of fun, too.	Ukax wali kusiskañawa, ukhamaraki.
A very unusual car.	Mä wali jan uñt’at auto.
Do this twice.	Ukxa pä kuti lurañamawa.
About what you did to him.	Kuntï jupar lurapkta uka toqetwa.
A great many snowflakes.	Mä jach’a walja ch’uqi.
This is very obvious.	Ukax wali qhanaw uñjasi.
How he could have done it.	Kunjamsa jupajj luraspäna.
One person really thought.	Mä jaqix chiqpachapuniw amuyäna.
But that doesn’t require the past.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw nayra tiempox wakiskiti.
You’re amazing, really.	Jumax muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.
Too late, too late.	Sinti qhipa, wali qhipa.
I didn’t want to say anything to him.	Nayax janiw jupar kuns sañ munkti.
Like there was nothing.	Kunjamtï jan kunas utjkänti.
He never did that now.	Jichhajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
That’s what makes me happy.	Ukaw kusisit jikjjatasi.
And now, this .	Ukat jichhax, aka .
He didn't know exactly how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He wants it quietly.	Jupax amukiw munaraki.
Whatever happened to him gets to you.	Kunas juparux pasäna ukax jumaruw puri.
Or he thought it necessary.	Jan ukajj wakisispa ukhamwa amuyäna.
That is the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañaw wali askejja.
Let’s see what’s interesting.	Kunas wali askïspa uk uñjañäni.
You don’t want it here.	Jumax janiw akan munktati.
How I still want to know.	Kunjamsa wali yatiñ munta.
And yes, it is.	Ukat jïsa.
He stayed for three days.	Jupajj kimsa uruw utjäna.
But nobody wants that.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk munkiti.
So far, the house is still in good shape.	Jichhakamax uka utax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
These are every day.	Ukanakax sapa uruw utji.
So today is the day.	Ukhamajj jichhüruw uka uru.
He had always thought she was beautiful.	Jupajj wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa nayratpach amuyasïna.
I think that’s everything.	Nayax ukax taqi kunaw sasaw amuyta.
Overall it was wonderful.	Taqi kunat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa.
Except it doesn’t matter what you do.	Jan ukasti janiw kunas wakiskiti, kuns lurasma.
I love her so much and .	Nayax juparux walpun munasta ukat .
Whatever you do, do your homework.	Kun lurañsa, tareanak lurañamawa.
But, I thank two people.	Ukampis, pä jaqiruw yuspärta.
It happened once a week.	Semanan mä kutiw ukham pasäna.
He’s obviously a guy.	Jupax qhanaw mä waynax.
He will come alone.	Jupa sapakiw jutani.
It was rarely available.	Ukajj jukʼakiw utjäna.
That means only one thing.	Ukajj mä sapakiw sañ muni.
But I never said anything to him.	Ukampis janipuniw jupar kuns siskti.
I was very happy there, very happy.	Ukanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I don’t mean recently but always.	Janiw jichhak sañ munkti jan ukasti sapa kutiw sañ munta.
Don't repeat yourself.	Janiw juma pachpajj mayamp luramti.
Much bigger, actually.	Walja jach’a, chiqpachansa.
Instead, someone else walked.	Jan ukasti mayniw sarnaqäna.
It won’t last very long.	Janiw sinti jaya pachax utjkaniti.
It was our last trip together.	Ukajj qhep qhepa kutiw mayachtʼasis sarapjjta.
I needed that today.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj walpun munasïna.
But then anything can happen.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunas pasaspa.
But this, this wasn’t the case.	Ukampis aka, akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I started this last year.	Nayax aka qhipa maraw qalltawayta.
That, too, is wrong.	Ukax, ukhamarakiw jan walïkiti.
And about getting here .	Ukat aka chiqar puriñ tuqitxa .
I heard a voice.	Mä arunak istʼta.
I always think of him, or so I think of him.	Nayax sapa kutiw jupat amuyta, jan ukax jupat ukham amuyta.
I’m pretty sure he did.	Nayax wali sum yatta, jupax ukham luratayna.
You’re in a good mood.	Jumax wali sumaw jikxatastaxa.
It was all baseball.	Taqi kunas béisbol satänwa.
You guys need to do that.	Jumanakajj ukham lurañaw wakisi.
But I like it that way.	Ukampis nayatakix ukham wali askiwa.
Now that is not the case for that.	Jichhajj ukatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or he can do something.	Jan ukajj kunsa luraspa.
But there was nothing, nothing.	Ukampis janiw kunas utjkänti, janiw kunas utjkänti.
He was a wonderful character.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ sarnaqäna.
Isn't that a good thing.	¿Janit ukajj walïki.
It’s been around for a long time.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw utji.
I thought it would be a good day.	Mä urux wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
I want to know everything about him.	Jupat taqe kunsa yatiñwa munta.
You think he really doesn’t like what he’s doing.	Jumax amuyta, jupax chiqpachapuniw jan wali kuntix luraski ukxa.
It’s too little too late.	Ukax wali juk’akiw wali qhipa.
It will do what needs to be done.	Kuntï lurañajj wakiski uk lurani.
We’ll see him in a moment.	Mä juk’a pachax jupar uñjañäni.
They know the worst.	Jupanakax juk’amp jan walinak yatipxi.
I had no idea whatsoever.	Nayajj janiw kunsa amuyirïkti.
He started at home.	Jupax utaparuw qalltäna.
There were no old people there.	Ukanjja janiw nayra jaqenakajj utjkänti.
I look forward to the heat.	Nayax uka junt’u pacharuw suyt’ta.
Let me repeat that .	Uk wasitat arsuñ munta .
I really like that.	Ukajj nayatakejj walpun gustitu.
And a little bit smaller.	Ukat mä juk’a jisk’a.
I know now that he has no idea.	Jupajj janiw kunsa amuykiti, uk jichhajj yattwa.
And that, of course, is what I like.	Ukat ukax, chiqpachansa, nayatakix wali askiwa.
I saw him, the other night.	Nayax jupar uñjta, yaqha arumax.
So he knew what time it was.	Ukatwa kuna horasas uk yatïna.
He didn't want to talk about anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa parlañ munkänti.
Well, that doesn't mean anything.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj kuns sañ munkiti.
I wish it happened more often.	Nayax juk’amp kutiw ukham lurasiñap munta.
You can’t do what you want to do here.	Janiw kuntï akan lurañ munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.
My only .	Nayan sapakiw .
It takes three days.	Kimsa uruw wakisi.
I don’t care at this point.	Nayax janiw aka chiqanx kunäkisa.
Or a lot of blood.	Jan ukax walja wila.
But you have to do it.	Ukampis uk lurañamawa.
Two weeks ago .	Pä semana nayrajj .
He wouldn't do anything like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham kuns lurkaspänti.
He just loved it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw munasïna.
But who knows for sure.	Ukampis khitis chiqpachapuni yati.
There is no time limit at that time.	Uka pachanx janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
He is doing everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa luraski.
I need someone else.	Nayax yaqha jaqiruw munta.
I have said it myself many times.	Naya pachpaw walja kuti sista.
Certainly not tonight.	Chiqansa janiw jichha arumax ukhamäkiti.
You can’t do a lot of things.	Janiw walja lurañanak lurañjamäkiti.
It’s already getting more and more intense.	Nayratpach juk’amp juk’amp ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
But I want to do that.	Ukampis nayajj ukham lurañwa munta.
It started again.	Ukajj wasitatwa qalltäna.
I decided last night.	Nayax qhipa arumax amtawayta.
After all, he’s kind of a scary little guy.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupax mä juk’a axsarkañ jisk’a jaqiwa.
Who doesn’t want to do their homework.	Khitis jan tareanakap lurañ munkiti.
He’s quiet, but very friendly.	Jupax amukiw, ukampis wali suma jaqiwa.
I happen to know how to speak.	Nayax kunjams arsuñ yatta sasaw pasäna.
Here’s what you don’t know.	Akax kuntix jumax jan yatkta ukawa.
That was happening again.	Ukaw wasitat luraskäna.
He almost died twice.	Jupajj niyaw pä kuti jiwjjäna.
This doesn’t work for very long.	Ukax janiw sinti jaya pachax irnaqkiti.
That's what he thinks.	Ukhamaw jupajj amuyi.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw amuykänti.
He doesn't want to see it.	Jupajj janiw uñjañ munkiti.
Let’s see what happened there.	Ukan kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
What he was doing there.	Kuntï jupajj ukan luraskäna.
It means all of this at the same time.	Taqi ukanak mä pachan sañ muni.
I wasn't sure where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
I’m looking for something.	Nayax kuns thaqhaskta.
It’s still there.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw ukan jikxatasi.
It's a lot of fun for me.	Nayatakejj wali kusiskañawa.
He takes good care of you.	Jupajj jumat sum uñji.
Once I had myself.	Mä kutix naya pachpaw utjäna.
The location is fine.	Kawkhantï utjki ukajj walikïskiwa.
Of course, this is not a bad thing.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw jan walïkiti.
But let's see how big it is.	Ukampis kunjamsa jachʼa uk uñjañäni.
He was a great guy.	Jupajj mä jachʼa jaqënwa.
And he saw it for himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uñjäna.
He really didn't mean it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk sañ munkänti.
In that case, somehow.	Uka tuqitxa, kunjamatsa.
It’s back to that moment.	Ukax wasitat uka pacharuw puri.
Kind of weird, actually.	Mä kasta muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.
That means big money.	Ukax jach’a qullqi sañ muni.
There was no precedent for this.	Ukatakejj janiw nayrajj utjkänti.
And he couldn't do it.	Ukat janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
But I wonder how long that will last.	Ukampis ukajj qhawqha tiempos utjani sasaw jisktʼasta.
It’s time to go to bed.	Ukax ikiñ utar sarañ pachaw purini.
And indeed, it is.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
She asked him sharply.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw jupar jisktʼäna.
Instead, he was busy.	Jan ukasti, jupajj jan tiemponiw sarnaqäna.
I can't imagine what could be there.	Kunas ukan utjaspa uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
That’s exactly what happens.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunatix luraski ukax.
He is in your presence.	Jupaw jumanakan utji.
And very quickly, in fact.	Ukat wali jank’akiw, chiqpachansa.
I feel very lonely here.	Nayax akanx wali sapakiw jikxatastxa.
It's a yes or no.	Mä jïsa jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There’s no warmer weather.	Janiw juk’amp junt’u pachax utjkiti.
In fact, he was very upset.	Chiqansa, jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I never quite knew what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk janipuniw sum yatkti.
Something new was needed.	Kuna machaq lurañas wakisïna.
Canadian time limit.	Canadá markanx mä juk’a pachaw utji.
But beyond that, there was nothing.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
But he remained silent.	Ukampis jupajj amukiw qheparäna.
Of course, I would have this again.	Chiqansa, nayax wasitat akax utjaspa.
No one knows the truth now.	Jichhajj janiw khitis kunatï cheqäki uk yatkiti.
He wondered if he had ever done that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He didn’t know exactly what it was.	Jupax janiw kunas chiqpachapunix uk sum yatkänti.
He sees you three times a week.	Jupajj semanan kimsa kutiw jumar uñji.
There was nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkänti.
You thought so too.	Jumax ukhamarakiw amuyayäta.
That is still important today.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But there is a good time.	Ukampis mä suma tiempow utji.
But then winter came.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, juyphi pachaw purinïna.
It was now two years ago.	Jichhajj pä mara nayraw pasäna.
He stayed wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw qheparäna.
Everything worked as it should at the time.	Taqi kunas kunjamtï uka tiempon lurañapäkäna ukhamaw irnaqäna.
But no one had done that before.	Ukampis janiw khitis nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
He had moved to another country.	Jupajj yaqha markaruw sarjjäna.
The way he sat up.	Kunjamsa jupajj qontʼasïna.
Repeat the process.	Uka tuqitxa wasitatwa lurañama.
You understand that.	Jumax uk amuyasta.
He saw the door.	Jupax punku uñjäna.
I don’t know how to find out.	Nayax janiw kunjams yatxatañ yatkti.
And he loved her dearly.	Ukat wali munasiñampiw jupar munasïna.
It went very smoothly.	Ukax wali sumaw sarnaqäna.
But there was no one to do it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk lurañapatak utjkänti.
Everything was immediate.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw utjäna.
So that's exciting.	Ukhamajj ukajj kusiskañawa.
He wants nothing to do with me.	Jupax janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
Well, that has nothing to do with it.	Ukhama, ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He doesn't like them.	Jupanakajj janiw jupar gustkiti.
Anyway, this is the most important thing you can do.	Kawkhansa, akax wali wakiskiriwa, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
And do what you can.	Ukat kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañamawa.
I want to stay alone.	Nayax sapak qhiparañ munta.
And let's see how that happened.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk uñjañäni.
It’s such a small house.	Ukhama jisk’a uta.
In fact, he did it twice.	Chiqansa, pä kutiw ukham luräna.
He spoke to me about it.	Jupaw nayarojj uka toqet parläna.
It looks the same now.	Jichhax ukhamarakiw ukham uñtasi.
Half the school.	Chika yatiqañ uta.
I had nowhere to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkitänti.
No, no, that’s not right.	Janiwa, janiwa, ukaxa janiwa walïkiti.
He really needed help.	Jupajj cheqapuniw yanaptʼa munäna.
And no, it wasn’t two days.	Ukat janiw, janiw pä urux utjkänti.
This seems impossible so far.	Ukax jichhakamax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
I never will, he thought.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
And he has that voice.	Ukat uka aru kunaw jupan utji.
Is that really possible? 	¿Chiqapunit ukham lurañax wakisispa?
it is not true.	janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
The guy doesn’t do anything.	Uka waynax janiw kuns lurkiti.
That's rarely what you want to do.	Ukajj jukʼakiw kuntï lurañ munkta ukajja.
That wasn’t here.	Ukax janiw akan utjkänti.
Well, kind of like that.	Ukhama, mä juk’a ukhama.
He decided to give it himself.	Jupa pachpaw churañ amtäna.
He didn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa jan yatkänti.
It’s the only thing that exists.	Ukax sapa mayniw utji.
He’s a good guy, you know.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
I want to give up so much.	Nayax walpun jaytañ munta.
It wasn't what it needed to be.	Janiw kunjamtï ukajj wakiski ukhamäkänti.
So it happened very quickly.	Ukhamajj wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
And he didn't want to know about it.	Ukat janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
There will be good, there will be bad.	Sumaw utjani, jan waliw utjani.
I haven’t said that once.	Janiw mä kutis ukham siskti.
That in itself is fascinating.	Uka pachpajj wali muspharkañawa.
He wants you to do the same.	Jupajj jumajj ukham lurañwa munaraki.
That wasn't exactly what he said.	Ukajj janiw cheqpachapun siskänti.
I guess that doesn’t mean.	Nayax amuyta, ukax janiw sañ munkiti.
It quickly became apparent.	Jankʼakiw ukham amuyasïna.
Check out the results here .	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi ukjja, aka .
Isn't that the case now.	¿Janit jichhajj ukajj ukhamäki.
But it’s not all that.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
I'm not going to go there.	Nayajj janiw ukar sarkäti.
I want him to do something.	Jupaw kuns lurañapatak munta.

Everything has a place.	Taqi kunas mä chiqaw utji.
I’m feeling very tough right now.	Jichhax wali ch’amaw jikxatasi.
It wants to enter.	Ukax mantañ muni.
But really, that’s what I like.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I wonder what happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
Anyone can make amazing things.	Khitis muspharkañ yänak luraspa.
It hasn’t been that long.	Janiw ukham jaya tiempox utjkiti.
He called several times.	Walja kutiw jawsäna.
I’d like to pay more.	Nayax juk’amp qullqi churañ munta.
He said something and quickly left.	Jupajj kuns arsüna ukat jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Many times it’s like that.	Walja kutiw ukhama.
I am not one myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw mä ukhamäkti.
He felt a little harsh.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qhuru jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I see where this is going.	Ukajj kawkirus saraski uk uñjta.
It was a lonely journey.	Ukajj sapakiw sarnaqäna.
That is why it takes time.	Ukatwa tiempojj munasi.
But he couldn't focus on it right now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj uka toqet chuym churañ puedkänti.
Something is wrong here.	Kunas jan waliw akan utji.
We both have to do that.	Panpachaniw ukham lurañasa.
Now there was nothing else to do.	Jichhajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
He’s always lived there.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukan jakasïna.
There’s nothing less than that.	Janiw kunas ukat juk’amp jisk’a utjkiti.
Everything I see is not.	Taqi kunatix uñjkta ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But the process is not.	Ukampis uka lurañajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he could do what he does best.	Ukat kuntï sum lurkäna uk luraspänwa.
Maybe I'm going to do these things.	Inas ukanak lurañ amtasta.
You might, but you definitely do.	Inas ukham lurasma, ukampis chiqpachapuniw uk lurasma.
Everything is clear.	Taqi kunas qhanawa.
You’re the one who’s involved.	Jumaw uka tuqitxa.

But never do that, now.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti, jichhax.
But he said that was not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupajj säna.
And that’s it now.	Ukat ukax jichhax ukhamawa.
That’s not the case .	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti .
Do it yourself.	Juma pachpa luram.
There is no way to do that.	Ukham lurañajj janiw utjkiti.
I worry about the new brand.	Nayax machaq markat llakista.

Everything is so much fun!.	¡Taqi kunas wali kusiskañawa!.
I am very grateful to him.	Jupar walpun yuspärta.

Yes, part of him.	Jïsa, jupat mä chiqa.

He had no idea where he was going, or how long he was going.	Kawkirus sarañapa, jan ukajj qawqha tiempos sarañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Inas jan qharüru, jan ukasti niyaw.

All of these are good for me.	Taqi ukanakax nayatakix wali askiwa.

Always he was so afraid.	Sapa kutiw jupajj ukham ajjsaräna.

Let’s look at that important part.	Uka wakiskir chiqat uñjañäni.

But he probably wouldn't have done that.	Ukampis inas jan ukham lurkaspänti.

It should take about an hour.	Niya mä horaw sarañapa.
He’s the one who did it.	Jupaw luräna.
But I'm not sure why you would.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham lurasma uk janiw sum yatkti.

I didn’t have any money.	Janiw kuna qullqis utjkitänti.
So far as the day is concerned .	Jichhakamax uka urux .
But I thought that was funny.	Ukampis ukajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
He had nothing to do with it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Almost better than this.	Niya juk’amp askiwa aka tuqitxa.
He was just lying there.	Jupajj ukhamakiw ukan ikiskäna.
You can do this later.	Ukjja qhepatwa lurasma.
He took it from her.	Jupajj jupat apsüna.

He did it, not me.	Jupaw uk luräna, janiw nayajj ukham lurkänti.
He didn't know exactly where to go.	Jupajj janiw kawkirus sarañapa uk sum yatkänti.
He was just as good as you.	Jupajj jumar uñtasit wali suma jaqënwa.
Please tell me how it will happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk yatiyapjjeta.

So there was no better way to do it.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkänti.
He told me he never wanted to see me again.	Jupajj janipuniw mayamps uñjañ munkti sasaw sitäna.
I like the cafe better.	Nayatakix uka café ukanx juk’amp askiwa.
We’re both like that .	Jiwasax panpachaniw ukhama .
Tell him that there was really nothing.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkänti sasaw jupar yatiyañama.

He worked undercover for some time.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jamasat irnaqäna.
That pretty much means everything.	Ukajj niya taqe kun sañ muni.
Of course, everything is fine.	Chiqansa, taqi kunas walikïskiwa.

Very bad indeed.	Wali jan wali chiqpachansa.
He didn't know why he expected anything else.	Kunatsa yaqha ukham suyäna uk janiw yatkänti.
What you can do in this situation is obvious.	Uka jan waltʼäwin kunsa lurasma ukajj qhanawa.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Ukat janiw kunsa uka toqet lurañjamäkiti.
And he said he loved her so much.	Ukat walpun jupar munasta sasaw säna.
What had he to do with all this.	¿Kunas jupajj taqe ukanak lurañapatak utjäna.
So this is what I thought.	Ukhamajj akham sasaw amuyayäta.
He’s actually a teacher.	Jupax chiqpachansa yatichiriwa.
At least once a year.	Mä kutis sapa mara.
He told me so.	Jupax ukhamaw sasaw sitäna.

He immediately began to live on his own.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupa pachpa jakañ qalltäna.
He said he could do better than you.	Jupajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp sum lurasmati sasaw säna.
He gave her permission to do so.	Uk lurañapatakiw jupajj permiso churäna.

But that doesn't matter so far.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jichhakamax kunäkisa.
He knows nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkiti.
But there’s one thing I can’t do.	Ukampis mä kunaw utji, janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He was a lot of people.	Jupajj walja jaqënwa.
A red one.	Mä wila.
I make some coffee.	Nayax mä juk’a café lurañ yatta.
It should be done twice.	Pä kutiw lurañapa.
He never did that himself.	Jupa pachpajj janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
After all, he didn’t.	Taqi kunat sipansa, janiw ukham lurkänti.
The rainy season is almost here.	Jallu pachax niyaw purini.
Or hot water.	Jan ukax junt’u uma.
Because that’s what it is.	Kunatix ukax ukhamawa.
Now, he could do it.	Jichhajj, jupajj luraspänwa.
He did a lot of the wrong thing.	Uka jan wali luratapat walpun luräna.
This meant giving water.	Ukajj uma churañ sañ munäna.
It looked cold and hungry.	Ukax thaya ukat manq’at awtjataw uñnaqäna.
He rolled his eyes again and this time she rolled her eyes.	Jupax wasitat nayranakap ch’allxtayäna ukat aka kutix jupax nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.

And no, it doesn’t.	Ukat janiw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Of course, it took a while.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa tiempow munasïna.

This wasn’t what he wanted, not anymore.	Akax janiw jupax munkänti, janiw juk’ampi.

He took the first thing that happened to him.	Jupajj nayrïr kunatï jupar paskäna uk apsüna.
He called out to her.	Jupajj jupar jawsäna.
No one wanted to get involved.	Janiw khitis ukar mantañ munkänti.

I hope he did that.	Nayax suyt’twa jupax ukham luratayna.
He went first.	Jupaw nayraqat saräna.
It is very important to me.	Nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.

Beyond that, there is nothing.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kunas utjkiti.

A big chunk of it.	Mä jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I don’t do that, at least.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti, mä juk’a.
Or it feels helpless.	Jan ukajj jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.

I was afraid of what might happen.	Ukham lurasajj kunas pasaspa sasaw ajjsarayäta.
So I couldn't do anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
It had the basics.	Ukanjja, kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utjäna.
He could not tell her everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kun yatiyañ puedkänti.
He seemed to be the worst.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He can do anything you can imagine.	Jupajj kuntï jumajj amuyki uk luraspawa.
I’m sure he meant it was all good.	Nayax yatxatwa, jupax taqi kuns wali askiwa sañ munäna.

Of course, there isn’t.	Chiqansa, janiw utjkiti.
He could do it now, he could do it here.	Jupax jichhax luraspänwa, akan luraspa.

And, let’s see.	Ukat, uñjañäni.
It 's not like that	Ukhamwa amuyasi .
He stayed there for ten years.	Jupajj tunka maranakaw ukan qheparäna.
But he doesn't think so now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukham amuykiti.
He saw it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak uñjäna.
She said so, and he admitted it.	Jupajj ukham sänwa, jupajj uk iyaw sänwa.

There’s always a day when you really need it.	Sapa kutiw mä urux chiqpachapuni ukax wakisi.

Tomorrow, of course.	Qhipürux, chiqpachansa.
After all, it’s not.	Taqi kunat sipansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
So it’s almost always there.	Ukhamajj niya sapa kutiw ukan utji.
But he’s done the wrong thing.	Ukampis jupax jan walinak lurawayi.
If you don't want to.	Jumatix jan munsta ukhaxa.
I had no idea how he could be so bad.	Kunjamsa jupax wali jan walin uñjasispa ukxa janiw amuykayätti.
He would have done her.	Jupaw jupar luraspäna.
Interestingly enough, that.	Wali muspharkañawa, ukax.
He didn't understand them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar amuykänti.
That leaves you in one or two places.	Ukax mä jan ukax pä chiqan jaytawayi.

You know, the old cold.	Jumax yatisktawa, nayra thaya.
He can't do that anymore.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp ukham lurkaspati.
So you have to do that.	Ukhamajj ukham lurañamawa.
It’s a really rich guy.	Chiqpachansa wali qamir jaqiwa.
And I love that about it.	Ukat uka toqet walpun munasta.
I’ve only been there once.	Mä kutikiw ukar sarawayta.

But all of this is not the case.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

He has her with him.	Jupajj jupampiw utji.
It’s a really small one, very nice.	Chiqpachansa mä jisk’a, wali suma.
So that's never the case.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukajj ukhamäkiti.
That person doesn’t exist.	Uka jaqix janiw utjkiti.
When did he do that.	Kunapachas ukham luräna.
He clearly did not.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He was staring at her intensely.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
As it stands.	Kunjamtï ukajj utjki ukhama.
Time is of the essence there.	Ukanjja, tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.

But that is part of the problem.	Ukampis ukajj uka jan waltʼäwit maynïriwa.
I don't think I can stand it for long.	Janiw jaya tiempo aguantañjamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
This is exactly what happens.	Akax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
Not as much as he did.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhama.

It was relatively quick.	Ukajj mä jukʼa jankʼakiw utjäna.
But something is still troubling me.	Ukampis kunas nayatakejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
He went very quietly.	Jupajj wali amukiw sarjjäna.

Or my for that matter.	Jan ukax nayan uka tuqitxa.
I hope you do it and do it well.	Nayax suyt’twa jumax uk lurañamawa ukat sum lurañamawa.

He didn’t say anything, of course.	Jupax janiw kuns arskänti, chiqpachansa.

Or the morning after.	Jan ukajj uka qhepat alwajj.
No one really knows.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis yatkiti.
And here it is again.	Ukat akax wasitatwa.
These are not available.	Ukanakax janiw utjkiti.
Very, very cold wind.	Wali, wali thaya thaya.
No one can do all of this.	Janiw khitis taqe ukanak lurkaspati.
He wondered if he was sorry.	Jupajj llakistwa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
I’m rather surprised.	Nayax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
Today, he knows better.	Jichhürunakanjja, jupaw jukʼamp sum yati.
No one did anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet kuns lurkänti.
I disagree with almost everything he says.	Niya taqe kuntï siski ukanakajj janiw nayajj iyaw siskti.
You have to do some work.	Mä juk’a lurañanak lurañamawa.
You already feel good.	Nayratpach wali sum jikxatasïta.
I want to take it from him.	Nayax jupat apsuñ munta.
At this point I don’t know what to do.	Aka pachanx janiw kuns lurañ yatkti.
But there’s no reason for you.	Ukampis janiw kuna razonas jumatakix utjkiti.
He didn’t say two words until he got home.	Utar puriñkamax janiw pä arunak arskänti.
So I am very happy for you.	Ukhamajj jumatak wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
I think you are right about this.	Nayax amuyta jumax chiqaw aka tuqitxa.
What do you want! 	Kunsa munta!
He still loves to get out and explore though.	Jupax wali munasiñampiw mistuñ ukat yatxatañ munaraki ukampis.
It was the last thing he remembered.	Ukajj qhep qhepa amtkäna ukawa.
He didn't really understand.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun uk amuykänti.
I have no idea where it is.	Nayax janiw kawkhans ukx amuykti.
He knows how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ yati.
You, more than anything else.	Jumax, taqi kunat sipansa juk’ampi.
I was really sad right now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I didn't realize it until a week ago.	Mä semana nayrajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
I realized this recently.	Jichhakiw ukajj nayarojj amuyasïna.
That was all he knew.	Ukakiw jupajj yatïna.
I was the first to admit it.	Nayajj nayrïr kutiw uk arsuwayta.
Or he didn't want to do anything.	Jan ukajj janiw kuns lurañ munkänti.
In fact, he wasn't aware of himself at all.	Chiqansa, janiw kunjamatsa jupa pachpat amuyaskänti.
I want to see you again.	Nayax jumar wasitat uñjañ munta.
He did this for many years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw ukham luräna.
I think it’s a lot of fun.	Nayax wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyta.
I want to make one.	Nayax mä lurañ munta.
But it only happened once.	Ukampis mä kutikiw ukham pasäna.
It’s good to do it outside.	Anqan lurañax wali askiwa.
So you really feel good.	Ukhamajj cheqapuniw jumajj sum jikjjatasta.
I don’t want one.	Nayax janiw mä munkti.
I don’t really like this one.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni akax gustkituti.
He decided to take the plunge again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uka amtar puriñ amtäna.
He never really liked her.	Jupajj janipuniw cheqpachapun jupar gustkänti.
Someone had arrived before him.	Jupat nayrajj mayniw uka cheqar purinïna.
That ended the season.	Ukax uka pacharuw tukuyäna.
He was the bad guy.	Jupajj uka jan wali jaqënwa.
Some wine, what.	Mä juk’a vino, kuna.
That came first.	Ukaw nayraqat jutäna.
Today, the reality is quite the opposite.	Jichhürunakanjja, kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I need a lot of you guys.	Nayax jumanakat walpun munta.
Do whatever you want with me.	Kuntï munkta uk luram nayamp chika.
No one really wants to know.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni yatiñ munkiti.
I do not believe what you are saying.	Nayajj janiw kuntï jumajj siskta uk creykti.
The point is clear.	Uka tuqitxa qhanawa.
But there was none after that.	Ukampis janiw uka qhepat utjkänti.
And that’s the best part about it.	Ukat ukax uka tuqit wali askiwa.
All of this really happened.	Taqi ukanakax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
Something, nobody.	Kunas, janiw khitis.
You are an amazing boy.	Jumax muspharkañ waynawa.
He did this for a long time.	Walja tiempow uk luräna.
Do what you say you will.	Kuntï siskta uk luram.
I’ve done a terrible thing.	Nayax wali axsarkañ lurawayta.
He’s feeling sad.	Jupax llakitaw jikxatasi.
I am happy here so far.	Jichhakamax akan kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Or why, for that matter.	Jan ukax kunatsa, uka tuqitxa.
You can do it quickly.	Jumax jankʼakiw uk lurasma.
He really isn’t bad.	Chiqpachansa jupax janiw jan walïkiti.
It’s what he has.	Ukax kunatix jupax utjki ukawa.
This is going to be fun and a great day.	Akax kusiskañawa ukat mä jach’a uruw utjani.
It is amazing how quickly this happened.	Ukajj kunjamsa jankʼak pasäna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
But, you know what.	Ukampis, jumax yatisktawa.
But today he didn't want to do anything wrong.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
Now let’s see how this can be done.	Jichhax kunjams uka lurañax utjaspa uk uñjañäni.
I could never quite figure it out.	Janipuniw uk sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
It doesn’t really work.	Janiw chiqpachansa irnaqkiti.
He seems to be the only warm-hearted guy anywhere.	Jupa sapakiw junt’u chuymanïkaspas ukham juk’ampi, kawkhans.
But no one else can do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati.
He went to go make coffee.	Jupax café lurañ sarañatakiw saräna.
Instead, it wasn’t.	Jan ukasti, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Yes, he decides.	Jïsa, jupaw amti.
That’s what happened to me this week.	Ukaw aka semanan nayar pasäna.
As a matter of fact .	Kunjamtï cheqäki ukhama .
Of course, it is important in this respect.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa wali wakiskiriwa.
Do the same thing every time.	Sapa kutiw pachpa lurañanak lurañama.
I’m just in the moment.	Nayax uka pachanx ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.
I struggled at home.	Nayajj utar wal chʼamachasiyäta.
Nowhere in the future.	Janiw kawkhans jutïrin utjkiti.
So far it is clear to me.	Jichhakamax nayatakix qhanawa.
I see this with great sadness.	Nayax wali llakitaw uk uñjta.
I never thought of it.	Janipuniw uk amuyirïkti.
Later, he lived in a house of his own.	Qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw mä utan jakasïna.
But he could do better in the morning.	Ukampis alwajj jukʼamp sumwa luraspäna.
Everyone but me, she said.	Taqeniw nayat sipansa, sasaw jupajj säna.
I’ve very rarely done that.	Nayax wali juk’akiw ukham lurawayta.
You look so serious.	Jumax wali sinti jach’a uñnaqaniwa.
There was no secret.	Janiw kuna jamasat lurañas utjkänti.
I didn’t know about it.	Janiw uka tuqit yatkayätti.
And why shouldn't he.	Ukat kunatsa jan ukham lurañapäki.
He is, of course.	Jupax ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
That’s how he always behaves.	Ukhamaw jupax sapa kuti sarnaqaski.
That’s what threw him.	Ukaw jupar jaqontäna.
He had just moved there.	Jupajj jichhakiw ukar sarjjäna.
I have never seen a better one.	Janipuniw jukʼamp suma uñjkti.
Here’s what you did for me.	Akax kuntix nayatakix lurapkta ukawa.
He’s done work here before.	Jupax nayrax akan irnaqäw lurawayi.
He wants the food.	Jupajj uka manqʼa muni.
Somehow he already knew.	Kunjamatsa jupax nayratpach yatïna.
That was never mentioned.	Ukajj janipuniw arskänti.
I didn’t really think I could do that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykayätti.
Perhaps something more serious is needed.	Inas jukʼamp jan walinak lurañax wakischispa.
He decides for himself what is right and what is wrong.	Jupa pachpaw kunatï walïki jan walïki uk amti.
I don't believe that.	Ukjja janiw creykti.
I understand why someone always wants that.	Kunatsa maynix sapa kuti ukham munki uk sum amuyta.
I’ve done that well.	Nayax uk sum lurawayta.
He says he doesn’t.	Jupax janiw sasaw arsu.
And, it worked for me.	Ukat, nayatakix wali askiwa.
He gave her a lot of energy.	Jupaw walja chʼam churäna.
That’s why he felt so good.	Ukatwa jupax wali sum jikxatasïna.
I didn’t know how to walk.	Janiw sarnaqañ yatkayätti.
I never wanted to be like that.	Janipuniw ukham tukuñ munkti.
I’ve seen all of these.	Taqe ukanak uñjta.
That was a giant.	Ukajj mä jachʼa jaqënwa.
I am able to use it immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw ukanak apnaqañ yatta.
Who do you prefer?.	¿Khitimpis jumajj jukʼamp munasma?.
Or at least a little more.	Jan ukax mä juk’a juk’ampi.
Each one is important.	Sapa mayniw wali wakiskiriwa.
But in the end, it pays off.	Ukampis qhepatjja, ukajj wali askiwa.
I don't want to rush into it.	Nayajj janiw jankʼak ukar mantañ munkti.
And she needed him for that.	Ukat ukatakix jupaw wakisïna.
I love that so much.	Ukajj wali munasiñampiw uñjta.
Me, a couple of times.	Nayax, mä pä kuti.
He was happy with himself now.	Jupajj jichhajj jupa pachpat kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
It’s very difficult and may take you a long way to go.	Ukax wali ch’amawa ukat inas wali jaya sarañax wakischispa.
But he said more.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼampiw säna.
I listen to it a lot.	Nayajj walpun istʼta.
I am really excited about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqit wal kusista.
Once a week, he said.	Semanan mä kutiw sasaw säna.
Nobody wants anything to do with you.	Janiw khitis jumamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
You know what I mean? 	¿Kunsa nayax sañ munkta uk yattati?
That’s it for me.	Ukax nayatakix ukhamawa.
Everything is fine now.	Jichhax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
I mean all day long.	Nayax taqi uruw sañ munta.
But he doesn't do anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns lurkiti.
But he obviously doesn't understand that.	Ukampis qhanaw jupajj uk jan sum amuykiti.
And another beer.	Ukat yaqha cerveza.
I love it in bed.	Nayax ikiñan walpun munasta.
Not before that time.	Janiw uka tiempo nayrajj utjkänti.
What's more.	Kunas juk'ampi.
So let’s see what happens!.	¡Ukhamajj kunas pasani uk uñjañäni!.
I’m finally feeling good.	Nayax qhipharux wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
Nothing here seems inappropriate.	Aka chiqanx janiw kuna lurañas jan askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
Anyway, it doesn’t matter.	Kawkhansa, janiw kunäkisa.
For a moment or two he said nothing.	Mä jukʼa tiempo jan ukajj pä tiempojj janiw kuns arskänti.
The weather is pretty good at this point.	Aka pachanx pachax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He will never do that	Janipuniw ukham lurkaniti .
Do this every day.	Sapa uruw ukham lurañama.
But anyone can do two things.	Ukampis khitis pä lurañanak luraspa.
I don’t understand it all.	Janiw taqpach amuykti.
It is difficult to go there alone.	Ukar sapak sarañajj chʼamakiwa.
It was just someone talking about it.	Ukajj khitis uka toqet parläna ukakiw utjäna.
Maybe now is the time.	Inas jichhajj tiempojj purini.
The quiet room.	Uka llamp’u cuarto.
He was the worst of all.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
You’re worried now.	Jumax jichhax llakitaw jikxatastaxa.
I am very disappointed in the car.	Nayax uka autot walpun llakista.
You can do better things yourself.	Juma pachpaw jukʼamp suma lurañanak lurasma.
And he’d do a bloody good job.	Ukat jupax mä wila suma irnaqäw luraspäna.
I’m in this bed with you.	Nayax jumamp chikaw aka ikiñan jikxatastxa.
So that’s the .	Ukhamajj ukajj .
And that sucked.	Ukat ukax chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
But yeah, that happened.	Ukampis jïsa, ukaw pasäna.
Just like he was doing.	Kunjamtï jupajj luraskäna ukhama.
How do you get this .	Kunjamatsa akax jikxatasi .
Almost morning came again.	Niya alwajj wasitatwa purinïna.
Pretty cold, actually.	Suma thaya, chiqpachansa.
It doesn't do that.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurkiti.
But he’s leaving soon.	Ukampis jupax niyaw sarxani.
They make me feel very sad.	Jupanakajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
We’ll both do that.	Panpachaniw ukham lurañäni.
There was nothing else he could do.	Jupat sipansa janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
This process takes about three hours.	Uka lurañatakix niya kimsa horanakaw munasispa.
And it feels good, for the first time.	Ukat wali sumaw jikxatasi, nayrïr kuti.
And it actually felt kind of good.	Ukat chiqpachansa mä jukʼa sumaw jikxatasïna.
And maybe that’s the point.	Ukat inas ukax uka tuqitxa.
What should he do now.	¿Kunsa jichhajj lurañapa.
He walked once.	Jupax mä kutiw sarnaqäna.
That’s all you need.	Ukakiw wakisi.
But every day was wonderful.	Ukampis sapa uruw wali sumapunïnwa.
No one wants to go first.	Janiw khitis nayraqat sarañ munkiti.
Only once but he saw her.	Mä kutikiw ukampis jupar uñjäna.
Don't forget to let us know.	Jan armasimti yatiyapxita.
There’s going to be something great.	Kuna jach’a lurañas utjani.
He was the one who did it.	Jupaw ukanak luratayna.
There are no other strangers in town.	Janiw yaqha jan uñt’at jaqinakax markanx utjkiti.
It would need it again.	Ukajj wasitatwa munasispa.
He rarely admits it himself.	Jupa pachpajj jukʼakiw uk arsu.
It was exactly as he said it would be.	Ukajj kunjamtï siskäna ukhamänwa.
How you see it is how you see it.	Kunjams jumax uñjta ukax kunjams uñjta ukawa.
It always was and it always will be.	Nayratpach ukhamänwa ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
But, really, that’s not good enough.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa, ukax janiw askïkiti.
I felt very bad about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali jan waliw jikxatasiyäta.
That made them a goal.	Ukaw jupanakar mä amtar tukuyäna.
So it takes a while.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
Not very good for a day trip.	Mä uru sarañatakix janiw sinti askïkiti.
He spoke in a stern voice.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw arsüna.
I know exactly what needs to be done.	Kun lurañas wakisi uk sum yatta.
Already he knows what’s up.	Nayratpachaw jupax kunas utji uk yati.
I am very worried now.	Jichhajj walpun llakista.
I want to give it away.	Nayax churañ munta.
I can’t say that.	Janiw uk sañjamäkiti.
There is no time limit.	Ukax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
It’s not entirely like that.	Janiw taqpach ukhamäkiti.
I’ve always loved you.	Nayax sapa kutiw jumarux walpun munasta.
I think we have as well.	Nayax amuyta, jiwasax ukhamarakiw utjistu.
I did the wrong thing.	Nayajj uka jan walinak lurayäta.
I’ve always wanted to do something.	Nayax nayratpachaw kuns lurañ munta.
Or maybe that's what you want.	Jan ukajj inas ukajj jumatak munsta.
He politely agreed.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw iyaw säna.
He knew how to control me.	Jupajj kunjamsa nayar apnaqañ yatïna.
The heat doesn’t matter.	Uka junt’u pachax janiw kunäkisa.
But he said he was.	Ukampis jupajj sänwa.
He knows exactly what he needs to do.	Kun lurañas wakisi uk sum yati.
Do as you think fit.	Kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamarjam luram.
So he couldn't have done that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurkaspänti.
He was such a man.	Jupajj ukham jaqënwa.
What is there for me? 	¿Kunas nayatakix utji?
Well and good, but nothing more.	Suma ukat suma, ukampis janiw juk’ampi.
So far, the best .	Jichhakamax, wali suma .
When you know what you want.	Kunapachatï kuntï munkta uk yatkta ukhajja.
He predeceased her.	Jupaw jupat nayrajj jiwjjäna.
It spoke well of itself.	Ukajj sum arsüna.
He’s always here, too.	Jupax sapa kutiw akan jikxatasi, ukhamaraki.
And it doesn’t really.	Ukat janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
He said it could last for years.	Jupax walja maranakaw utjaspa sasaw säna.
But it was still a good idea.	Ukampis wali sumwa amuyasïna.
He said he was right.	Jupax chiqaw sasaw säna.
Not today, he told himself.	Janiw jichhürojj ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
That meant tonight.	Ukajj jichha arumaw sañ munäna.
Of course, there is nothing quite like that.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas ukham chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
But it works, he thinks.	Ukampis walikïskiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyi.
And this is .	Ukat akax .
And it took some time.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempow munasïna.
He didn't want anyone to come inside.	Jupajj janiw khitirus mantañ munkänti.
You know, for the first time.	Jumax yatisktawa, nayrïr kutiw ukham uñjta.
What is the job now?.	¿Kuna lurañas jichhax utji?.
He acts like he does this every day.	Jupax sapa uru ukham luraski ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
He went after it.	Jupajj uka qhepatwa saräna.
Also, you can do it yourself.	Ukhamaraki, juma pachpaw lurasma.
He told her to do so.	Jupajj ukham luram sasaw säna.
It wasn’t far to get home.	Utar puriñkamax janiw jaya sarañax utjkänti.
I don’t have time for that right now.	Jichhax janiw ukatakix tiempox utjkituti.
I said it would be good.	Nayax wali askïspawa sasaw sista.
You have to do it alone.	Jumax sapakiw lurañama.
I did everything by myself.	Naya sapakiw taqi kuns lurayäta.
I'm not sure what's good.	Kunas askïspa uk janiw sum yatiñ munkti.
I was just surprised, you know.	Nayax ukhamakiw muspharta, jumax yatisktawa.
I’m doing all of these things.	Nayax taqi ukanak luraskta.
Because you’re a good person.	Kunatix jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
Do it now, if you need to.	Jichhax lurañamawa, wakisispa ukhaxa.
It’s really fun to do.	Chiqpachansa lurañax wali kusiskañawa.
He was nobody like that.	Jupajj janiw khitis ukhamäkänti.
I love it when that happens.	Kunapachatï ukham luraski ukhajja, walpun gustitu.
I thought I would do that.	Ukham lurañwa amuyayäta.
And there, .	Ukat ukanjja, .
And another eye.	Ukat yaqha nayra.
And that ended beautifully.	Ukat ukax wali sumaw tukuyäna.
That didn’t exist ten years ago.	Ukax tunka mara nayrax janiw utjkänti.
We all have a role to play here.	Taqinipuniw akan lurañax utjistu.
Now he needs our help.	Jichhajj jupajj jiwasan yanaptʼa munaraki.
It’s been night after night.	Ukhamaw arumax arumax utjawayi.
Then he asked her what.	Ukat kunsa sasaw jisktʼäna.
I like that about it.	Uka tuqitxa nayatakix wali askiwa.
It was like that for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukhamänwa.
We all have a role to play.	Taqinipuniw mä lurañax utjistu.
You’ll love it in bed.	Jumax wali munasiñampiw ikiñan jikxatasïta.
But he was doing better than me all day.	Ukampis jupajj taqe uruw nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum luraskäna.
It’s nice to have someone like that.	Wali sumaw maynix ukham jikxatasïna.
I thought it was pretty stupid.	Nayax wali llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamaw amuyayäta.
He has done well all along.	Jupajj taqe tiempow sum lurawayi.
I made the best decision.	Nayax wali sum amtawayta.
Or him, for that matter.	Jan ukax jupar, uka tuqitxa.
Very, very lonely.	Wali, wali sapaki.
I feel that this is wrong.	Ukajj janiw walïkiti sasaw amuyasta.
But there is something.	Ukampis kunas utji.
You know where he’s at.	Jumax yatisktawa kawkhans jupax jikxatasi.
And he would do it again, he says.	Ukat wasitatwa luraspäna, sasaw saraki.
I just saw them recently.	Jichhakiw jupanakar uñjta.
He’s more, because it’s more than that.	Jupax juk’ampi, kunatix ukat juk’ampi.
So, let us know.	Ukhamajj, yatiyapjjeta.
And that’s pretty unusual.	Ukat ukax wali jan uñt’atawa.
This is a very popular holiday.	Akax mä fiesta ukanx wali uñt’atawa.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with doing so.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañatakix janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
But that may take years, or it may never happen.	Ukampis ukajj walja maranakaw munasispa, jan ukajj janipuniw utjkaspati.
But he didn’t want to stay.	Ukampis janiw qheparañ munkänti.
Because it was so good and it happened so fast.	Kunatix wali sumapunïnwa ukat jank’akiw pasäna.
He’s always, always nice.	Jupax sapa kutiw, sapa kutiw wali suma jaqiwa.
Now is the best time.	Jichhax wali suma pachaw purini.
And let’s see what happens next.	Ukat kunas uka qhepat pasani uk uñjañäni.
But there is no such person.	Ukampis janiw ukham jaqejj utjkiti.
But first you need to do some flying.	Ukampis nayraqat mä qhawqha avión lurañaw wakisi.
Well, so bad.	Ukhama, ukhama jan wali.
He’s kind of able to do it alone.	Jupax mä juk’a sapakiw uk lurañ yati.
No, it’s not, really.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Let's take a good look, he said.	Suma uñjañäni, sasaw jupajj säna.
There will be a man about it.	Uka tuqitxa chachax utjani.
You want something more.	Jumax juk’amp kuns munta.
I never anticipated that.	Janipuniw uk nayratpach amuyirïkti.
That’s why I love them so much.	Ukatwa jupanakar wal munasta.
I'm a very strong man.	Nayajj wali ch'amawa.
You know, the snow.	Jumax yatisktawa, ch’uqi.
He was nothing, he did nothing.	Jupajj janiw kunäkisa, jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
I’m a filmmaker.	Nayax mä película lurañ yatta.
That would take too much time.	Ukatakejj sinti tiempow munasispa.
There is no past or future.	Janiw nayra pachas ni jutïr pachas utjkiti.
Well, why, yes.	Ukhama, kunatsa, jïsa.
The person is a person.	Jaqix mä jaqiwa.
It’s hard to eat at home for that.	Ukatakix utan manq’añax ch’amawa.
He knew what was going to happen.	Jupajj kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
This is the big guy.	Akax jach’a jaqiwa.
Finally, I realized something.	Qhepatjja, kuns amuyayäta.
The reason, you know.	Uka kunatsa, jumax yatisktawa.
And certainly not for me.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He was the one who said that.	Jupaw ukham säna.
I hope there will be plenty of time to do so.	Ukham lurañatakix walja tiempow utjani sasaw suytʼaskta.
He’s the one who takes care of them.	Jupaw jupanakar uñji.
It was a very sad night.	Uka arumax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He was more afraid than anything else.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼampiw ajjsaräna.
Everything comes quickly.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw purini.

He was not himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpa ukhamäkänti.
I saw him this morning.	Jichha alwaw jupar uñjta.
That means it wasn’t midnight.	Ukax janiw chika arumax utjkänti sañ muni.
Elsewhere however.	Yaqha chiqanx ukampis.
I’ve already seen one.	Nayax nayratpach mä uñjta.
It’s a very small place for me though.	Nayatakix mä wali jisk’a chiqaw ukampis.
Everything I disagree with you.	Taqi kunas jumamp jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I think you can do that.	Nayax amuyta, jumax ukham lurasma.
Fortunately for me, it wasn’t.	Nayatakix wali askiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Still everything was fine.	Wali taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I wonder what happened to me.	Kunas nayar pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
It doesn’t work anymore.	Janiw juk’ampi irnaqkiti.
You’re right .	Jumax chiqpachapuniw .
That’s right, yes.	Ukax ukhamawa, jïsa.
A good one, if necessary.	Mä suma, wakisispa ukhaxa.
And he clearly wasn't.	Ukat qhanaw jan jupajj ukhamäkänti.
It takes half an hour to get there.	Ukar puriñkamax chika horaw munasispa.
But it will take some time.	Ukampis mä qhawqha tiempow munasini.
I never believed that.	Janipuniw uk creykti.
These are amazing! 	¡Ukanakajj wali muspharkañawa!
I don’t know what I really want to do.	Janiw nayax kuntï chiqpachapuni lurañ munkta uk yatkti.
Let me see what happens myself.	Naya pachpaw kunas pasaski uk uñjañäni.
That’s what he doesn’t do here.	Ukax kuntix jupax janiw akan lurkiti.
What a special day.	Kunjamsa mä urux wali askïspa.
And that's all there is to it.	Ukat ukakiw ukatakejj utji.
That’s the only thing that should do it.	Ukakiw ukham lurañapa.
He knows the language.	Jupax uka aru yati.
I’m the one who asked.	Nayax khitis jiskt’asta.
So you have to act fast.	Ukhamajj jankʼakiw lurañama.
Overall, he did the job well.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupax wali sumwa uka irnaqäw luräna.
And you only need one.	Ukat mä sapakiw munasispa.
He came, there was nothing to do.	Jupajj jutäna, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
So there could be one or two downsides.	Ukhamajj mä jan ukajj pä jan waliw utjaspa.
I didn’t see a thing.	Janiw mä kuns uñjkti.
But there is something necessary.	Ukampis kunas wakisi.
The question was exactly that.	Uka jisktʼajj cheqapuniw ukham säna.
There was something wrong with him.	Jupan wali jan waliw utjäna.
This is what I like .	Akax nayatakix wali askiwa .
You would be very useful.	Jumax wali askïspawa.
Today, left eye.	Jichhürunakanxa, ch’iqa nayra.
But I don’t have it yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax nayatak utjkiti.
And it was for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow ukhamänwa.
He died ten years ago.	Jupajj tunka mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
He preached all over the country.	Jupajj taqe markanwa yatiyäna.
He said everything about it.	Uka tuqitxa taqi kunwa säna.
Real big, too.	Chiqpach jach’a, ukhamaraki.
He feels unworthy.	Jupajj jan askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
At the time, I wasn't sure why.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kunatsa sum yatkayätti.
I didn't quite understand it.	Nayajj janiw uk sum amuyirïkti.
Seriously, he said.	Sinti, jupax ukham sänwa.
He didn't know why he thought anything.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa kunsa amuyäna uk yatkänti.
It’s always a good idea to do it in a safe environment.	Sapa kutiw mä jan walt’äwin lurañax wali askïspa.
Someone wants to do that .	Maynix ukham lurañ muni .
I think it looks great.	Nayax wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
But ultimately, he likes it.	Ukampis qhepatjja, jupajj wal gusti.
I love all the energy.	Nayax taqi ch’amampiw wal munasta.
Or this evening.	Jan ukax jichha jayp’ux.
I am as much as anyone can say.	Nayajj kunjamtï khitis siskta ukhama.
Which is definitely wrong.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan wali sañ muni.
What do you think of it.	Kunas jumatakix ukhama.
They don’t know if it’s okay.	Jupanakax walikïskiti janicha uk janiw yatipkiti.
That's all right.	Uka taqe kunas walikïskiwa.
He began to speak again.	Jupajj wasitatwa parlañ qalltäna.
And this is definitely not enough today.	Ukat akax chiqpachapuniw jichhürunakanx jan wakiskiti.
I think he did well tonight.	Nayax amuyta, jupax jichha arumax wali sum lurawayi.
You really don’t want to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañ munktati.
I am really looking forward to tomorrow.	Chiqpachansa qharüruw suytʼaskta.
That has nothing to do with me.	Ukax janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.
There’s still a lot of energy.	Wali ch’amampiw utji.
You felt the same way.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasïna.
Ultimately, it wasn't.	Qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
You know, that doesn’t mean who he is.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax janiw khitis jupax uk sañ munkiti.
It’s always this .	Ukax sapa kutiw aka .
A pretty good one.	Mä suma suma.
I made it as a wedding gift.	Nayajj casarasiñatak mä regalo ukham lurayäta.
And he really means it.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw uk sañ muni.
We need to do more of that.	Uk jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
I don’t know what to do.	Nayax janiw kuns lurañ yatkti.
I want to know more about it.	Uka toqet sum yatiñ munta.
I don't need it.	Nayajj janiw wakiskiti.
He could not speak our language.	Jupajj janiw jiwasan arunak parlañ puedkänti.
Surprising isn’t it?.	Muspharkañawa ¿janich ukhamäki?.
Here’s what it means.	Akax akham sañ muni.
Really great place.	Chiqpachansa jach’a chiqa.
So it was a taxi.	Ukhamajj mä taxi ukhamänwa.
I’m drinking more.	Nayax juk’amp umañ yatta.
Like when .	Kunjamtï kunapachatï .
At the time, he felt a little big.	Uka tiemponjja, mä jukʼa jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He’s a nice guy, actually.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, chiqpachansa.
I’ve obviously done it again.	Nayax qhanaw wasitat lurawayta.
That’s what he knows.	Ukax uk yati.
It’s called summer.	Ukax verano satawa.
He thought it was pretty cool.	Ukax wali sumaw sasaw amuyäna.
That’s not good, it’s not good at all.	Ukax janiw askïkiti, janiw kunas askïkiti.
But obviously, that's not what you want.	Ukampis qhanawa, janiw ukajj jumatak askïkiti.
But I don't believe it.	Ukampis nayajj janiw iyaw siskti.
But you have to do it.	Ukampis jumajj uk lurañamawa.
I don't really like that.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wal gustkituti.
That was twenty years ago.	Pä tunka mara nayrajj ukhamänwa.
He doesn’t know how to say it.	Jupax janiw kunjamsa uk sañ yatkiti.
I never knew what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janipuniw yatkayätti.
But it is often wrong.	Ukampis walja kutiw jan walïkiti.
I said it was fine.	Nayajj walikïskiwa sasaw sista.
That’s okay, too.	Ukax walikïskiwa, ukhamaraki.
I have no past.	Nayajj janiw nayra tiemponïkti.
It doesn’t work at the moment, of course.	Jichha pachanx janiw irnaqkiti, chiqpachansa.
Everything was very quick.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw utjäna.
That in itself meant nothing.	Uka pachpajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
It's never a good thing.	Janipuniw ukajj walïkiti.
He was pleasantly surprised by it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa muspharäna.
Yours is pretty simple.	Juman utjki ukax wali ch’amawa.
New this and last that.	Machaq aka ukat qhipa uka.
You’re coming to me.	Jumax nayaruw jutta.
It always works.	Ukax sapa kutiw irnaqäna.
It handles well.	Ukax sum apnaqi.
I didn’t do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
He really seems like a nice guy.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali suma jaqir uñtatawa.
There are a couple of strengths.	Ukanx mä pä ch’amaw utji.
He decided to do something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañwa amtäna.
You won’t be here.	Jumax janiw aka chiqanx utjkaniti.
That also doesn’t work.	Ukax ukhamarakiw janiw irnaqkiti.
He had no idea what time it was.	Kuna horasas uk janiw amuykänti.
I’ve seen the truth.	Nayax chiqaw uñjta.
Or someone like him.	Jan ukajj jupar uñtasit khitis.
I really loved that and great time.	Chiqpachansa ukat wali jachʼa tiempox walpun munasta.
This happened in two days.	Ukajj pä uruw pasäna.
So much more attractive.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp sumaw uñjasi.
That would do nothing.	Ukajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
A new decade.	Mä machaq tunka mara.
He thrust harder into it.	Jupajj jukʼamp chʼamampiw ukaruw jaqontäna.
Or so she told me.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj sitäna.
That’s what we have here.	Ukaw akan utjistu.
Not that it meant much.	Janiw ukajj walpun sañ munkänti.
Tomorrow could be a crucial moment.	Qhipürux wali wakiskir pachaw utjaspa.
That’s not enough for you.	Ukax janiw jumatakix wakiskiti.
But he seemed to know what was what.	Ukampis kunas kunas uk yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
There’s the low and the high.	Ukanx jisk’a ukat jach’a ukanakaw utji.
Small one however.	Jisk’a mä ukampis.
But then he started it.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jupaw qalltäna.
But I just don’t know how.	Ukampis nayax janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
He went to the hospital with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw hospitalar sarjjäna.
I have seen it with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw uk uñjta.
He lived alone, always.	Jupax sapakiw jakasïna, sapa kutiw jakasïna.
But it won't be that fast.	Ukampis janiw ukham jankʼak utjkaniti.
He’s expecting something from her.	Jupax jupat kuns suyt’aski.
I think he was excited about it.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
In fact, that’s exactly what he did.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax luräna.
In fact, he kept his eyes on me.	Chiqansa, nayranakap nayaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
I feel like it works for me.	Nayatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamaw jikxatastxa.
How long he doesn't know.	Qhawqha tiempos uk jan yatkiti.
He was a wicked little man.	Jupajj jan wali jiskʼa jaqënwa.
You know, here, with me.	Jumax yatisktawa, akan, nayamp chika.
You know who’s good for you, and who’s not.	Jumax yatisktawa khitis jumatakix askïspa, ukat khitis jan askïspa.
That’s really what he says here.	Ukhama chiqpachansa jupax akanx siwa.
It’s gorgeous, and looks amazing.	Ukax wali sumawa, ukat muspharkañ uñtatawa.
I just feel better now.	Jichhajj ukhamakiw sum jikjjatasta.
Everyone knows about it.	Taqinipuniw uka tuqit yatipxi.
Nobody wants to work there.	Janiw khitis ukan irnaqañ munkiti.
This one felt right.	Aka maynix chiqaw sasaw amuyasïna.
So something had to be done.	Ukhamajj kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
There is no reason why you should.	Kunatsa ukham lurañama ukxa janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
I realized he did that for me.	Jupax nayatakix ukham luratayna uk amuyasta.
I had to do the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw ukham lurañajj wakisïna.
While he was asleep.	Jupajj ikiskäna ukhajja.
But he knows a secret.	Ukampis jupajj mä jamasat yati.
But not if we celebrate this.	Ukampis janiw aka fiesta lurañäni ukhaxa.
What you say next is important.	Kuntï jutïrin siskta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
A great many.	Mä jach’a walja.
He refused to give her room in the house.	Jupajj janiw utar cuarto churañ munkänti.
He had no idea how, but now he knew.	Kunjamsa uk janiw amuykänti, ukampis jichhajj sum yatïna.
I think this would be perfect for that.	Nayax amuyta akax ukatakix wali askïspawa.
He didn't want to go alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak sarañ munkänti.
Can’t stand it after all.	Janiw aguantañjamäkiti taqi kunat sipansa.
I say seriously, seriously.	Nayax sinti, wali jach’a sasaw sista.
It doesn’t matter if it works or not.	Ukax walikïskiti janicha ukax janiw kunäkisa.
That's how he feels.	Ukhamaw jupajj jikjjatasi.
What happens when .	Kunas pasaspa ukat .
Here’s what we’ll do.	Akax kuntix jiwasax lurañäni.
That's something you don't want.	Ukajj mä kunaw jan munktati.
The beer is very good.	Uka cerveza ukaxa wali sumawa.
A couple of days, maybe.	Mä pä uru, inas.
The money is pretty good.	Qullqix wali sumawa.
You have a face.	Jumax mä uñnaqaniwa.
He started, and so did he.	Jupajj qalltäna, jupajj ukhamarakiw qalltäna.
I never did these things.	Janipuniw ukanak lurkti.
So I don't think that's the case.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti.
And he decides to do so.	Ukat ukham lurañ amti.
You may not want to see it properly.	Inas jan sum uñjañ munsta.
I’m not, maybe.	Janiw ukhamäkti, inas.
I really didn’t want to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk lurañ munkayätti.
There was a day.	Mä uruw utjäna.
It gets real bad, real quick.	Ukax chiqpach jan wali, chiqpach jank’akiw jikxatasi.
That doesn't mean much.	Ukajj janiw sinti sañ munkiti.
I just can’t stand it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx aguantañjamäkiti.
Something that moved.	Kunas kunas sarnaqäna.
It’s always me, me, me.	Ukax sapa kutiw naya, naya, naya.
The timing is crucial.	Uka pachax wali wakiskiriwa.
All of this seemed to make sense to me.	Taqe ukanakajj nayatakejj wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
It wasn't, but he didn't know it.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
I want someone to do something about him.	Maynix jupat kuns luraspa uk munta.
Fortunately, that’s wrong.	Wali askiwa, ukax janiw walïkiti.
I think he was devastated.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
The room itself was beautiful.	Uka cuarto pachpajj wali sumapunïnwa.
She really loves him.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasi.
It’s a very exciting time.	Uka pachax wali kusiskañawa.
There’s always something going on.	Sapa kutiw kunas pasaski.
I just wanted to say that.	Nayax ukhamakiw ukham sañ munta.
Maybe you’re right, after all.	Inas jumax sum amuyta, taqi kunat sipansa.
That is what he wants for us now.	Ukaw jupajj jichhajj jiwasatak muni.
He loved her with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar munasïna.
He thinks you’re a good guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqïtawa sasaw amuyi.
Or no one believed it.	Jan ukajj janiw khitis uk iyaw siskänti.
He said he couldn't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurirjamäkti sasaw säna.
Everything is awesome.	Taqe kunas wali muspharkañawa.
It’s really important to me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
Everything else.	Taqi kunas juk’ampi.
It gave me sleepless nights.	Ukaw jan ikiñ arumax churitu.
To be honest, he didn't know much about it.	Chiqpachansa, janiw uka tuqit sum yatkänti.
He was the one who did these things.	Jupaw ukanak luräna.
Of course it wasn’t, of course it wasn’t.	Chiqansa janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
Tell me what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiyapxita.
That means everything.	Ukax taqi kunaw sañ muni.
It was no problem for me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
It’s almost noon.	Niya chika uruw purini.
He never had a reason.	Jupajj janipuniw kuna razonas utjkänti.
I thank you very much.	Nayax jumarux walpun yuspärta.
That speaks well for itself.	Ukax jupa pachpaw wali suma arsu.
It looks worse.	Ukax juk’amp jan waliw uñtasi.
He then called two others.	Ukat yaqha pä jaqiruw jawsäna.
He committed to it.	Jupajj ukaruw arsüna.
I doubt he would.	Jupajj ukham luraspawa sasaw pächasta.
I never made any real money.	Janipuniw chiqpach qullqi jikxatkti.
Of course this is very important.	Chiqansa ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
He doesn’t understand it yet.	Jupax janiw jichhakamax amuykiti.
There is no need to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But there is nothing I want there.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukan munkta ukajj utjkiti.
Well today is the last day.	Suma jichhüruw qhipa uru.
He’s doing well.	Jupax wali sum sarnaqaski.
I didn’t expect to see anyone.	Janiw khitirus uñjañ suykayätti.
Or, all red.	Jan ukax, taqpach wila.
You absolutely do.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw ukham lurasma.
I cannot disagree.	Janiw nayajj jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I think he knew that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uk yatïna.
No one did much of anything.	Janiw khitis kuns wal lurkänti.
Your very own self.	Juman wali munat juma pachpa.
Every time someone knows something.	Sapa kutiw maynix kuns yati.
I see things more clearly now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sumwa kuns uñjta.
This year promises to be bigger and better.	Jichha marax juk’amp jach’a ukat juk’amp sumaw utjani sasaw arsuwayi.
I don’t remember you.	Janiw jumat amtaskti.
It’s rare and very common.	Ukax juk’akiw ukat wali uñt’atawa.
So far he’s been a good guy.	Jichhakamax jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
But this time it looks even worse.	Ukampis aka kutin jukʼamp jan waliw uñjasi.
He spends a lot of time with you.	Jupax jumamp chikaw walja tiempo sarnaqäna.
I think it means something else.	Nayax amuyta, ukax yaqha sañ muni.
I didn't think he would.	Janiw jupajj ukham lurañap amuykayätti.
So he won't do it.	Ukhamajj janiw uk lurkaniti.
But no, no, everything is fine.	Ukampis janiw, janiwa, taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
Maybe it’s worth eating once in a while.	Inas mä kuti manq’añax wakischispa.
That’s strange, she thought.	Ukax muspharkañawa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Of course he sees it.	Chiqansa jupax uk uñji.
I don't believe him.	Nayajj janiw jupar iyaw siskti.
No one there is good for me, or wants me, really.	Ukanx janiw khitis nayatakix askïkiti, ni munkiti, chiqpachansa.
I really feel like I can do that.	Chiqpachansa, ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
It’s hard these days, you know.	Aka urunakanx wali ch’amawa, jumax yatisktawa.
That’s how it felt.	Ukhamaw ukham amuyasïna.
I am now .	Nayax jichhax .
I certainly won’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkäti.
You know, too.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukhamaraki.
I am really grateful to him.	Chiqpachansa, juparux walpun yuspärta.
The last time he didn’t want to talk about it.	Qhipa kutix janiw uka tuqit parlañ munkänti.
He knew it for sure.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk yatïna.
It’s really really hard.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa ch’amawa.
Better to do something than do nothing.	Jan kun lurañat sipansa kun lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
He was quiet about it.	Jupajj uka toqet amukiw säna.
But that is not the case with humans.	Ukampis janiw jaqenakajj ukhamäkiti.
It seemed really interesting.	Chiqpachansa wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
There’s still a lot of it.	Ukanx waliw utji.
He shook the snowflakes.	Jupax ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’allxtayäna.
He didn't want to go too early.	Jupajj janiw sinti alwat sarañ munkänti.
I don't know anything about you.	Janiw nayajj jumanakat kunsa yatkti.
Me, I never did that.	Naya, janipuniw ukham lurkti.
So it was wonderful in that regard.	Ukhamajj uka toqetwa wali sumapunïnwa.
If not, you know who.	Ukax janiw ukhamäkiti, jumax yatisktawa khitis.
That is what you are asking.	Ukaw jumajj jisktʼasta.
There's no need to rush it.	Janiw jank'ak lurañax wakiskiti.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx juk’amp arsuñ munkti.
This is not a good thing, but it is not a bad thing.	Ukajj janiw askïkiti, jan ukasti janiw jan walïkiti.
This is not very common.	Ukax janiw sinti utjkiti.
He immediately went to the front bedroom.	Jupajj jankʼakiw nayrïr ikiñ utapar saräna.
Maybe you think it’s worth it.	Inas jumax wali askïkaspas ukham amuyasta.
So much less than him.	Ukhamajj jupat sipansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
Finally night came.	Qhepatjja, arumaw purinïna.
We’ll do it pretty well.	Jiwasax wali sum lurañäni.
So far, nothing has been done.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti.
I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.	Nayax manq’añax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
It’s a busy, exciting day.	Uka urux wali ch’amawa, wali kusiskañawa.
He finally got what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna uk qhepat katoqäna.
No one said a word in response.	Ukham lurasajj janiw khitis mä arunak arskänti.
Let’s see what’s in there.	Ukan kunas utji uk uñjañäni.
A middle ground.	Mä chika aru.
That doesn't matter what you need.	Ukajj janiw kunatï jumatak wakiski ukajj wakiskiti.
Then do it again the next day .	Ukat qhipürux wasitat lurañaw wakisi .
And he feels good about it.	Ukat jupax wali sumwa uka tuqit jikxatasi.
It wasn’t this last time.	Janiw aka qhipa pachax utjkänti.
The school didn’t care.	Yatiqañ utax janiw kuns lurkänti.
I am doubly grateful for that.	Ukax pä kutiw yuspärta.
So much the better, as it should.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa, kunjamtï lurañapäkäna ukhama.
You have to do it outside.	Anqan lurañamawa.
For you for you .	Jumatakix jumatakix .
He had always felt that way.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukham jikjjatasïna.
It is also important in terms of finances.	Ukhamaraki, qullqi tuqitxa wali wakiskiriwa.
Everything is very rough.	Taqi kunas wali qhuru.
I mean it really sounds silly to me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamaw sañ munta.
I’ve seen this before.	Nayax nayrax ukham uñjta.
I like to have lunch.	Chika uru manq’añax nayatakix wali askiwa.
The next day he phoned.	Qhipürux telefonot jawsäna.
About a year passed.	Niya mä maraw pasäna.
That's all he wants to do.	Ukajj taqe kunwa jupajj lurañ muni.
He graduated from high school.	Jupax jach’a yatiqañ utan yatiqañ tukuyäna.
He really wants to stay.	Jupajj cheqapuniw qheparañ muni.
It’s so very small.	Ukhama wali jisk’a.
A new era has arrived.	Mä machaq pachaw purini.

They don’t quite know, you know.	Jupanakax janiw sum yatipkiti, jumax yatisktawa.
That’s how food can be.	Ukhamaw manq’añax utjaspa.
This is not a bad thing.	Ukajj janiw jan walinak lurkiti.
So he will do it.	Ukhamajj uk lurani.
So then you can do the same with me.	Ukhamajj ukhamajj nayampejj ukhamarakiw lurasma.
He’s coming soon.	Jupax niyaw purini.
That was a different matter.	Ukajj yaqha toqetwa parläna.
Everyone has to do it.	Sapa mayniw lurañapa.
I'm not saying that.	Nayajj janiw ukham siskti.
Or maybe .	Jan ukajj inas .
I don't understand why he gave it to me.	Kunatsa ukham churitu uk janiw amuykti.
Yeah, it was dumb.	Jïsa, ukax amukiw jikxatasïna.
He repeated the words.	Jupajj wasitatwa uka arunak arsüna.
I want to be honest.	Nayajj taqe chuyma arsuñ munta.
Who knows for sure, except him.	Khitis chiqpachapuni yati, jan ukasti jupa.
Christmas dinner was wonderful.	Navidad manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa.
I had no idea where it was going.	Kawkirus purini uk janiw amuykayätti.
He spoke very quietly.	Jupajj wali amukiw parläna.
As fast as you can!.	¡Jank’akiw kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukhama!.
Well, it looks good.	Suma, wali suma uñtatawa.
I know a lot about these things.	Ukanakat wal yatta.
Sure enough, one day he did.	Chiqpachansa, mä urux ukhamarakiw luräna.
Something clearly needed to be done.	Kunas qhanaw lurañax wakisïna.
I didn’t anticipate that.	Nayax janiw uk nayratpach amuyirïkti.
I’m alone here.	Nayax sapakiw akan jikxatastxa.
Or at least three of them.	Jan ukax kimsa tuqitsa.
I know he wants out of here.	Nayax yattwa jupax aka chiqat mistuñ muni.
But, interestingly, it was.	Ukampis, wali muspharkañawa, ukhamänwa.
I kind of had both.	Nayax mä juk’a panpachaniw utjäna.
A little deep half going a lot.	Mä juk’a manqhan chikat sarañ walja.
I’m still stuck here.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw akan jikxatasiyäta.
No one thought it would happen.	Janiw khitis ukham pasañap amuykänti.
I will take a walk with you.	Nayajj jumamp chikaw mä jukʼa kayuk sarä.
Now let’s do two things.	Jichhax pä lurañanak lurañäni.
It was indeed a beautiful day.	Chiqansa, uka urux wali sumapunïnwa.
So pretty much it's all done.	Ukhamajj niyaw taqe ukanak lurawayi.
I know mine really did.	Nayax yattwa nayan chiqpachapuniw ukham luratayna.
I mean something secret.	Nayax kuna jamasat sañ munta.
I know how, yes.	Kunjamsa uk yattwa, jïsa.
It will be available for three days.	Kimsa uruw utjani.
But you’re the only one.	Ukampis juma sapakiw.
What and how you like it.	Kunas ukat kunjamsa jumatakix wali askïspa.
It feels really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But I didn’t do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkti.
But he wanted to go back inside.	Ukampis wasitatwa mantañ munäna.
He did something about it.	Jupajj kuns luräna.
We don’t have that opportunity at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw uka oportunidad ukax utjkiti.
He doesn’t want to come.	Janiw jutañ munkiti.
That’s really exciting.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
Not necessary here.	Janiw akanx wakiskiti.
There can never be anything.	Janipuniw kunas utjkaspati.
He will do everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa lurani.
But he doesn't understand that.	Ukampis janiw uk amuykiti.
He is a schoolteacher.	Jupax yatiqañ utan yatichiriwa.
I understood the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj sum amuyayäta.
He is doing very well himself.	Jupa pachpaw wali sum luraski.
But never wholeheartedly.	Ukampis janipuniw taqe chuyma.
He wants to give.	Jupax churañ muni.
It’s been an amazing year for that.	Ukatakix mä muspharkañ maraw utjawayi.
In fact, I think you remember a lot.	Chiqansa, jumax wal amtasta sasaw amuyta.
It doesn’t exist anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha cheqan utjkiti.
He knew how to do little things.	Jiskʼa lurañanak lurañ yatïna.
Tomorrow would be a good time for that.	Qhipürux ukatakix wali askïspawa.
He says he can’t find anything more.	Jupax janiw juk’amp kuns jikxatkti sasaw saraki.
He did it several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uk luräna.
And another and another, and dozens more.	Ukat yaqha ukat yaqha, ukat tunka tunka juk’ampi.
Somehow, he didn't quite understand.	Kunjamatsa, janiw sum amuyaskänti.
I don’t know everything about why.	Janiw kunatsa taqe kun yatkti.
I don't want to know anything about it.	Janiw uka toqet kuns yatiñ munkti.
It has been going on for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham sarnaqäna.
He gave me these books for you.	Jupaw uka libronak jumatak churitu.
There was no such time.	Uka tiempojj janiw utjkänti.
I think that was the beginning.	Ukaw qalltäna sasaw amuyta.
He did it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa ukham luräna.
He looked all himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqpach uñnaqäna.
It’s such a great school.	Ukhama jach’a yatiqañ uta.
He took it very quickly.	Jupax wali jank’akiw apsüna.
No one understands why it exists.	Janiw khitis amuykiti, kunatsa ukham utji.
I never really knew that.	Janipuniw chiqpachansa uk yatkti.
I don’t like him either.	Nayax janiw juparux gustkituti.
So he went quickly.	Ukatwa jankʼak saräna.
I never did what he wanted me to do.	Janipuniw kuntï jupajj lurañ munkäna uk lurkti.
It’s a bit of a snowflake.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’uqi satawa.
He really didn’t want to do that.	Chiqpachansa jupax janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I like everything about this.	Nayatakix taqi kunas aka tuqitx wali askiwa.
This has nothing to do with it.	Akax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
For one thing, just as he wanted.	Mä tuqitxa, kunjamtï jupax munkäna ukhama.
Now the.	Jichhax uka...
Except that everything was perfect.	Jan ukasti taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
But that was all that mattered.	Ukampis ukakiw wakisïna.
Now, you have to do yours.	Jichhax, jumax jumanakan lurañamawa.
Well, he did that.	Sumaw ukham luräna.
This is a really exciting time.	Chiqpachansa aka tiempox wali kusiskañawa.
I used to have a	Nayrajj mä .
And for a while it was.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempojj ukhamänwa.
It’s never too early to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix janipuniw wali nayrax utjkiti.
Of course, I appreciate that.	Chiqansa, uk wali askit uñjta.
Fortunately, there was no time.	Wali askiwa, janiw kuna pachas utjkänti.
And he really loved her.	Ukat chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasïna.
He couldn't stay there.	Jupajj janiw ukan qheparañ puedkänti.
Eventually, I realized it.	Qhepatjja, uk amuyayäta.
It was found for a year.	Mä maraw jikjjatasïna.
And that is just what he has.	Ukat ukajj ukhamarakiw jupajj utji.
And tell me something first.	Ukat nayraqat kuns yatiyapxita.
In the small place.	Jisk’a chiqansa.
You will feel better about it.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼamp sumwa jikxatasïta.
He’s an amazing guy, though.	Jupax mä muspharkañ jaqiwa, ukampis.
He seemed to be an old man.	Jupajj nayra jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
Tonight’s dinner is good.	Jichha arumax manq’añax wali askiwa.
And yes, it can happen.	Ukat jïsa, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
I remember a single one.	Mä sapak amtasta.
Do this at least once a day.	Urun mä kutis uk lurañamawa.
Eventually, it was.	Qhepatjja, ukhamänwa.
He wondered why.	Kunatsa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
She said yes to him.	Jupajj jïsa sasaw jupar säna.
Or the last day.	Jan ukajj qhep qhepa uru.
I said yesterday.	Nayax qharüruw sista.
I never thought he would actually do that.	Janipuniw cheqpachapun ukham lurani sasin amuyirïkti.
A man,	Mä chachajja, .
Rain, snow and cold wind.	Jallu, ch’uqi ukat thaya thaya.
He wasn't sure what to do about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kunsa lurañapa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
These are quick and easy to make as well.	Ukanakax jank’akiw ukat jank’akiw lurañax ukhamaraki.
It’s all good but that doesn’t mean it’s bad.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa ukampis ukax janiw jan waliw sañ munkiti.
So that's not it.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw.
It was all in what he said.	Kuntï siskäna ukanjja, taqe ukanakaw utjäna.
So he took care of it himself.	Ukhamajj jupa pachpaw ukanak sum uñjäna.
I’ve seen stuff like that.	Nayax ukham yänak uñjta.
But anyone can do it.	Ukampis khitis uk luraspawa.
I wanted nothing more.	Janiw jukʼamp kunsa munkayätti.
I never did, actually.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, chiqpachansa.
I thought it was .	Ukham sasaw amuyayäta .
That’s what makes it interesting.	Ukaw ukax wali askïspa.
Now you have the	Jichhajj jumajj .
I can almost feel how he feels about her.	Kunjamsa jupar uñji uk niyaw amuyasta.
I think he’s amazing.	Nayax amuyta, jupax muspharkañawa.
Almost anyone.	Niya khitis.
I have something else that is equally exciting.	Nayax yaqha kunaw utjitu ukax pachpa kusiskañawa.
I don't like that very much.	Ukajj janiw sinti gustkituti.
I did everything myself.	Naya pachpaw taqe kuns lurayäta.
Always keep it a secret.	Uka tuqitxa sapa kutiw jamasat yatiyañama.
This is kind of weird.	Akax mä kasta muspharkañawa.
It’s just so bad.	Ukhama wali jan wali.
Whatever you do.	Kunas jumax lurasma.
This is all very exciting, actually.	Akax taqpach wali kusiskañawa, chiqpachansa.
I don't see why he would.	Kunatsa ukham luraspa uk janiw uñjkti.
You are very important to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
The boy thought he knew everything.	Uka waynax taqi kun yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
You’re such a great guy.	Jumax ukham jach’a jaqiwa.
But he didn't think that would happen.	Ukampis janiw ukham pasañap amuykänti.
Maybe something else happens.	Inas yaqha kunas pasaspa.
It can’t be done .	Janiw lurañjamäkiti .
There was nothing together.	Janiw kunas mayachtʼasis utjkänti.
I don't want to see it anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp uñjañ munkti.
He’s tough, but he’s very rich.	Jupax qhuru jaqiwa, ukampis wali qamir jaqiwa.
I know how to do it.	Nayax uk lurañ yatta.
I really like what you do.	Chiqpachansa, kuntï lurapkta ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
The real me feels like this .	Chiqpach nayax ukham jikxatasi .
Or as he intended.	Jan ukajj kunjamtï jupajj amtkäna ukhama.
Do whatever you want with me.	Kuntï munkta uk nayamp luram.
Or for that matter.	Jan ukajj ukatakix.
He wanted to do it all right.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum lurañwa munäna.
It takes about an hour.	Ukax niya mä horaw puri.
I made him go.	Nayaw jupar sarañapatak lurawayta.
But it’s still a nice surprise.	Ukampis wali suma muspharkañawa.
It’s more exciting.	Juk’amp kusiskañawa.
There were two parts.	Ukanx pä chiqaw utjäna.
I knew what was going to happen there.	Ukan kunas pasani uk sum yatiyäta.
He accepted it with great sadness.	Jupajj wali llakitaw uk katoqäna.
Then, it’s even more difficult.	Ukaxa, juk’ampi ch’amawa.
And that’s exactly what ended badly the last time.	Ukat ukax chiqpachapuniw qhipa kutix jan walin tukuyäna.
Which is the only reason.	Kunatsa ukax kunatsa ukakiw utji.
Something very important is happening.	Mä wali wakiskir kunaw pasaski.
And then there was an hour.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, mä horaw utjäna.
He left to go home.	Utar sarañatakiw sarxäna.
Jiwas is a very nice guy.	Jiwasajj wali sumawa.
I think they are interesting.	Nayax jupanakax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Can’t do too badly.	Janiw sinti jan walinak lurañjamäkiti.
That seems silly, really.	Ukax llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
And that meant nothing.	Ukat ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
He looks so hot.	Jupax wali junt’u uñnaqaniwa.
Very obviously yes.	Wali qhanaw jïsa.
Looks good so far.	Jichhakamax wali suma uñtatawa.
After all, he needs one last love.	Chiqansa, jupax mä qhip qhipa munasiñampiw wakisi.
He didn't want to see it.	Jupajj janiw uñjañ munkänti.
Right now it’s not right now.	Jichhax janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
That’s not the case.	Ukax janiw ukax utjkiti.
It happened in the middle of the day.	Ukajj chika uruw pasäna.
It definitely needs to be improved.	Chiqpachansa jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisi.
Everything seemed possible.	Taqi kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I left it all to him.	Taqe ukanak jupar jaytawayta.
That seems really interesting.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
You ask so many questions.	Jumax ukham walja jiskt’asta.
I am planning a different kind of life.	Nayax yaqha kasta jakañ amtaskta.
I want a small kind of house.	Nayax mä jisk’a kasta uta munta.
He did not give his name.	Jupajj janiw sutip arskänti.
I’m worried about food.	Nayax manq’añ tuqit llakistwa.
I don’t want to buy it now.	Jichhax janiw alañ munkti.
You can do everything right.	Taqi kunsa sum lurasma.
He did it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw ukham luräna.
So he said to himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpajj säna.
It is agreed upon.	Ukax iyaw satawa.
The latter two were faster.	Uka qhipa pä jaqinakax juk’amp jank’akiw jikxatasïna.
I find this fascinating.	Nayatakix akax wali muspharkañawa.
Sure, he has one.	Chiqpachansa, jupax mayniw utji.
He lay there for three days.	Kimsa uruw ukan ikiskäna.
Bad bad bad bad bad.	Jan wali jan wali jan wali jan wali.
Now that doesn’t matter.	Jichhax ukax janiw kunäkisa.
It doesn’t matter about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunäkisa.
It worked for me in a dumb way.	Ukajj nayatakejj mä amukiw irnaqäna.
Who are you, guys? 	Khitis jumajj?
No one could speak.	Janiw khitis parlañ puedkänti.
Everything he had.	Taqi kunas jupaw utjäna.
But he didn't know anything.	Ukampis janiw kunsa yatkänti.
I don’t want to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjañ munkti.
John didn't say that.	Juanajj janiw ukham siskänti.
I’ve been doing this for half a year now.	Jichhax chika maraw ukham luraskta.
As you all have done.	Kunjamtï jumanakajj taqenis lurapkta ukhama.
He was very surprised to see this.	Uk uñjasajj walpun jupajj wal muspharäna.
It stayed for two hours.	Pä horaw qheparäna.
He hit it hard this time.	Jupax aka kutix wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
Above all, she’s a beautiful woman.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupax mä suma warmiwa.
But it doesn't look pretty.	Ukampis janiw suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
Who is the guy? 	¿Khitis ukajja?
Do things that only you can do.	Kunanaktï juma sapakiw lurañjamäki ukanak luram.
But he is your man.	Ukampis jupajj juman jaqewa.
So he called her.	Ukatwa jawsäna.
That's all you can do.	Ukakiw jumajj lurasma.
You better be here with us.	Jumax juk’amp askiwa akan nanakamp chika.
It’s all about how he does it.	Taqi kunas kunjamsa uk luraski ukawa.
But another time on this.	Ukampis yaqha pachan aka tuqitxa.
Well bad if you will.	Suma jan wali jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
I was shaking myself.	Naya pachpaw chʼalljjtayasïna.
I want to leave you alone.	Nayax juma pachpaw jaytañ munta.
But it still felt deep.	Ukampis ukajj wali chuymaw jikjjatasïna.
I am truly grateful and thankful.	Chiqpachansa walpun yuspärta ukat walpun yuspärta.
It's in a great location and at a great time.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi ukat wali suma pacharuw puri.
It sucks big though.	Ukax chuyma jach’a ukampis.
He was in deep distress.	Jupajj sinti llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
And he can do it.	Ukat jupax luraspawa.
I felt a rush.	Mä jankʼakiw mä jukʼa jikjjatasta.
I was so happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj walpun kusista.
I don't know when he will.	Jupajj kunapachas ukham lurani uk janiw yatkti.
And maybe maybe .	Ukat inas inas .
You think it’s good enough.	Jumax amuyta ukax wali askiwa.
Don’t give up .	Janiw jaytañamäkiti .
But his identity was very clear.	Ukampis khitïnsa ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
The guy is really nice.	Chiqpachansa uka waynax wali sumawa.
Something needs to be done about it.	Kunas uka tuqit lurañax wakisi.
He always refused.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jan munkänti.
I’ve done this for a long, long time.	Nayax wali jaya, jaya pachaw ukham lurawayta.
I thought this would be interesting.	Nayax akax wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
It’s always necessary.	Ukax sapa kutiw wakisi.
I don’t really know what else to say.	Janiw chiqpachapunix yaqha tuqit arsuñ yatkti.
It felt the same way for me.	Nayatakejj ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasïna.
There’s still a lot of energy.	Wali ch’amaw utji.
I know that .	Nayax uk yattwa .
He obviously wants to pay for it.	Jupax qhanaw ukatakix qullqi churañ muni.
Still feeling some light rain.	Wali mä juk’a llamp’u jallu jikxatasi.
And the worst restaurant.	Ukat juk’amp jan wali manq’añ uta.
The house is amazing and the location is even better.	Uka utax muspharkañawa ukat ukanx juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
This is even better.	Akax juk’amp askiwa.
I’ve always noticed this.	Nayax sapa kutiw uk amuyasta.
It didn’t exist in the present.	Janiw jichha tiempon utjkänti.
It may take hours to travel.	Inas walja horanak sarañajj wakischispa.
You want to improve yourself.	Juma pachpaw jukʼamp sum lurañ munta.
I have no idea why this happens.	Kunatsa ukham pasaspa uk janiw amuykti.
That’s exactly what no one can do today.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jichhürunakanxa, janiw khitis lurañjamäkiti.
I don't want to talk about it any further.	Janiw uka toqet jukʼamp parlañ munkti.
Don’t do it for me.	Janiw nayatakix uk luramti.

That’s all there is so far.	Ukakiw jichhakamax utji.
Still a snowflake.	Wali ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Nothing for me here.	Janiw kunas nayatakix akan utjkiti.
He made a real john.	Jupax mä chiqa john luratayna.
You may need to go to an important hospital .	Inas wali wakiskir hospitalar sarañajj wakischispa .
But it is more than that .	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼampiw .
And then he realized something else.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, yaqha toqetwa amuyasïna.
Everything is right.	Taqi kunas chiqaw sañ muni.
Well, it’s really good.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
That’s what it looks like now.	Jichhax ukham uñtatawa.
He said he didn't know for sure.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkti sasaw säna.
Why would anyone do that?.	¿Kunatsa khitis ukham luraspa?.
He really didn’t want to go.	Chiqpachansa janiw sarañ munkänti.
I was really surprised.	Chiqpachansa walpun muspharta.
I think I think.	Nayax amuyta amuyta.
He still lived in the city.	Jupajj wali markanwa jakasïna.
They can’t have it both ways.	Jupanakax janiw uka pä tuqitx utjkaspati.
This season has been the best so far.	Aka pachax jichhakamax wali sumawa.
I don't disagree with you.	Nayajj janiw jumamp jan iyaw siskti.
We will do it ourselves.	Jiwasajj jupa pachpaw lurañäni.
And a guy who had a whole lot of trouble.	Ukat mä waynax mä taqpach jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
It’s flat and cold.	Ukax ch’uqi ukat thaya ukhamawa.
No, he isn't.	Janiwa, janiw jupajj ukhamäkiti.
He said he couldn't do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurirjamäkti sasaw säna.
Available for quick action.	Jank’ak lurañatakiw utji.
I’m sure he knows how you feel.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax kunjams jumax amuyta uk yati.
And it really isn’t necessary.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw wakiskiti.
He didn't know what to do with himself.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupa pachpat lurañ yatkänti.
That will have nothing to do with me.	Ukajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkaniti.
There’s nothing there! 	¡Janiw kunas ukan utjkiti!
I don’t want any money.	Janiw kuna qullqis munkti.

Ten years ago today.	Tunka mara nayraw jichhürunakanxa.
I want to tell you about him.	Jupat yatiyañ wal munta.
But it took a long time.	Ukampis walja tiempow munasïna.
I don’t remember that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit amtaskti.
Not really, though.	Janiwa chiqpachansa, ukhama.
There is nothing after that.	Uka qhepatjja janiw kunas utjkiti.
Now he's hungry for food.	Jichhax jupax manq'at awtjataw jikxatasi.
He knew the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatïna.
I loved the police.	Nayajj policiaruw munasïna.
Maybe you can do the same thing now.	Inas jichhax pachpa lurañanak lurasma.
It has been bad for a long time.	Wali jaya tiempow jan walin uñjasi.
I really don’t get that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk jikxatkti.
I would definitely do it again.	Chiqpachansa wasitatwa uk lurañ munta.
But that doesn’t make for better management time.	Ukampis ukax janiw juk’amp suma apnaqañ pachax utjkiti.
You’re on your own, you’re older.	Jumax sapakiw jikxatastaxa, jilïr jaqïtawa.
I can't say for sure when that will happen.	Kunapachas ukajj pasani uk janiw cheqpachapun siskti.
I gave up everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa jaytawayta.
If that’s enough for you, that’s enough.	Ukax jumatakix walikïskiwa, ukax walikïskiwa.
That’s all right.	Ukax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
More on that to come.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼampiw jutïrin utjani.
It wasn’t in the summer.	Jallu pachanx janiw ukhamäkänti.
He will do well here.	Jupajj akan sum lurani.
I can't even figure out how to do it.	Kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janis amuytʼirjamäkti.
And so it should be.	Ukat ukhamarakiw lurañapa.
He felt something.	Jupajj kunsa jikjjatasïna.
You asked me something.	Jumax mä kuns jiskt’itu.
It wasn't, he thought.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Don't do this to them now.	Janiw jichhajj jupanakar uk luramti.

But he did it many times.	Ukampis jupajj walja kutiw ukham luräna.
I’m sorry, I have to be like you.	Nayax llakistwa, jumar uñtasit lurañamawa.
You just exist.	Jumax ukhamakiw utji.
He’s a tough guy, but he’s the reason.	Jupax wali qhuru jaqiwa, ukampis jupax kunatsa.
Many times you can do both.	Walja kutiw uka pä tuqit lurasma.
Or the year.	Jan ukax mara.
But so far it has been silent.	Ukampis jichhakamax amukiw jikxatasïna.
But of course I know that’s not the case.	Ukampis chiqpachansa nayax yattwa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was something else.	Jupajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He didn't understand now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj amuyaskänti.
This is not the worst case scenario.	Ukajj janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
Here's more .	Akax juk'ampi .
But he lived alone.	Ukampis jupa sapakiw jakasïna.
And there’s no money.	Ukat janiw qullqix utjkiti.
He meant no, he knew it.	Jupax janiw sañ munäna, jupax uk yatïna.
Great, indeed.	Jach’a, chiqpachansa.
A first for me.	Nayatakix mä nayrïr.
But let’s see what’s really going on.	Ukampis kunas chiqpachapuni pasaski uk uñjañäni.
And I was like that.	Ukat nayajj ukhamänwa.
About everything else, it is.	Taqi kuna tuqitxa, ukhamawa.
By far the coolest night.	Jaya pachaw juk’amp thaya arumax.
Time is really important.	Chiqpachansa tiempox wali wakiskiriwa.
But I don’t like anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitis nayar gustkituti.
He’s going to be the man.	Jupax uka jaqiruw saraski.
He was amazed at who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk wal muspharäna.
And next time, and next time.	Ukat jutïr kutin, ukat jutïr kutin.
And people don't like that.	Ukat jaqenakajj janiw ukajj gustkiti.
I still use it.	Nayax wali apnaqañ yatta.
He was an important person to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali wakiskir jaqënwa.
I didn't know at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw yatkayätti.
I can do it anywhere.	Nayax kawkhans uk lurasmati.
Maybe he could have done better.	Inas jukʼamp sum luraspäna.
A light hit him.	Mä qhanaw juparux ch’allxtayäna.
But he knew that wasn't enough.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wakiskiti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
It just happened there.	Ukanjja ukhamakiw pasäna.
How he was afraid.	Kunjamsa jupajj ajjsaräna.
I’m a very rough guy.	Nayax wali qhuru jaqïtwa.
She was half afraid he would.	Jupajj ukham lurani sasaw chikat ajjsaräna.
Do it consistently and with the same speed.	Sapa kutiw lurañama ukat pachpa jankʼakiw lurañama.
I didn't think so myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham amuykayätti.
You look so hot.	Jumax wali junt’u uñnaqaniwa.
So there was nothing I could do about it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas uka toqet lurañajj utjkänti.
But he does nothing about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet kuns lurkiti.
Your new self.	Juman machaq juma pachpa.
He came to a different world then her.	Jupax yaqha pacharuw jutäna ukat jupat sipansa.
He knew how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I don’t like that for some reason.	Nayatakix ukax janiw askïkiti kunatsa.
What do you think of	¿Kunas jumax .
Tell me all about it.	Taqi ukanak yatiyapxita.
Can’t say more here.	Janiw juk’amp akanx sañjamäkiti.
I haven’t seen him yet.	Janiw jichhakamax jupar uñjkti.
So it will take a while.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempow pasani.
You’ll feel better if you don’t.	Jan ukham lurasax wali sum jikxatasïta.
He’s too young for me.	Jupax nayatakix wali waynawa.
I don’t want to use it.	Nayax janiw uka apnaqañ munkti.
It’s obviously cool.	Ukax qhanaw thaya.
I don't want anything from you.	Janiw nayajj jumanakat kunsa munkti.
I have seen this many times.	Nayajj walja kutiw uk uñjta.
I don't want to eat anything.	Janiw kuns manq'añ munkti.
One means one thing.	Maynix mä sañ muni.
Time is getting shorter and shorter.	Tiempojj jukʼamp jukʼakiw utji.
And how he went abroad.	Ukat kunjamsa jupajj yaqha markar saräna.
He made a bed.	Jupax mä ikiñ luratayna.
I’m going there myself.	Naya pachpaw ukar saraskta.
This is not universal.	Ukajj janiw taqe cheqan utjkiti.
No, he didn't say all of that.	Janiwa, janiw ukanak taqe kuns siskänti.
But there is no shortage of time.	Ukampis janiw mä jukʼa tiempos utjkiti.
I'm not going to go to him.	Nayajj janiw jupar sarkäti.
A couple of days.	Mä pä uru.
And people, too, of course.	Ukat jaqinakax, ukhamaraki, chiqpachansa.
He wants to know everything.	Taqi kun yatiñ muni.
And that means everyone.	Ukat ukax taqiniruw sañ muni.
This happened only twice.	Ukajj pä kutikiw pasäna.
It’s not good for anyone.	Janiw khitirus wali askïkiti.
It’s amazing how he does it.	Kunjamsa jupax luraski ukax muspharkañawa.
That is not the case .	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti .
It’s hard and you know it.	Ukax ch’amawa ukat jumax yatisktawa.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
And maybe that's the point.	Ukat inas uka tuqitxa ukham lurañapa.
And it happened a long time ago.	Ukat nayratpachaw pasäna.
I don’t want him here.	Nayax janiw juparux akan munkti.
Everyone knows how to use it.	Taqinipuniw apnaqañ yatipxi.
And really, he didn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurkänti.
You can just do it at home.	Utan ukhamakiw lurasma.
You can do both, too.	Jumax panpachaniw lurasma, ukhamaraki.
That’s what it should do.	Ukaw ukham lurañapa.
There was no major problem.	Janiw kuna jachʼa jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I was surprised myself.	Naya pachpaw muspharta.
But he doesn't think it's pretty.	Ukampis janiw suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuykiti.
Just like we will.	Kunjamtï jiwasajj lurañäni ukhama.
In fact he almost never did.	Chiqansa niya janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
It wasn't something that happened all the time.	Janiw kunatï sapa kuti paskäna ukhamäkänti.
He said he had none.	Jupajj janiw kunas utjkituti sasaw säna.
It can be the only one.	Uka sapakiw utjaspa.
This is simply not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, jan ukasti janiw ukhamäkiti.
Either that’s good, or it’s not.	Jan ukax ukax wali askiwa, jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I never thought it would do anything really bad.	Chiqpachansa jan walinak luraspa sasaw janipuniw amuyirïkti.
I don’t need to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
A very lovely house.	Mä wali munat uta.
It feels everything deeper.	Taqi kuns juk’amp manqhan jikxatasi.
And it arrived early in the morning.	Ukat wali alwaw purinïna.
One person choked up.	Mä jaqejj chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
More on that to come!.	¡Uka tuqitx jukʼampiw jutïrin utjani!.
It suits him, of course.	Juparux wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
And it wasn't like that before.	Ukat janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
It’s really unbearable.	Chiqpachansa janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
It’s a great .	Ukax mä jach’a .
That’s really amazing.	Ukax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
There will be only one.	Mä sapakiw utjani.
I wonder what it is.	Kunas ukajj sasaw jisktʼasta.
I didn’t expect that from you.	Janiw jumanakat ukham suykayätti.
And he learned it.	Ukat jupaw yateqäna.
For once he did something right.	Mä kutikiw jupax kuns sum luratayna.
I wonder what he will do.	Kunsa jupajj lurani sasaw jisktʼasta.
It’s time to make a decision.	Mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
That was his new beginning.	Ukaw jupajj machaq qalltäna.
Such a beautiful room.	Ukham suma cuarto.
He couldn't say a word.	Jupajj janiw mä arunak parlañ puedkänti.
Things still need to be done.	Kunanakas wali lurañaw wakisi.
It is a wonderful thing .	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa .
Things are going to be fine.	Kunanakas walikïskiwa.
Which he could not have done.	Ukajj janiw jupajj lurkaspänti.
It's a fascinating question.	Mä jisktʼajj wali muspharkañawa.
He knew he would never be inside you.	Jupajj janipuniw juma manqhan utjkaniti uk sum yatïna.
Nothing good, really.	Janiw kunas askïkiti, chiqpachansa.
The winter is so cold, there’s nothing else to do.	Juyphi pachax wali ch’amawa, janiw yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
He wants to be secretive.	Jupajj jamasat lurañwa muni.
He did not say what he would do about it.	Uka jan waltʼäwit kunsa lurani uk janiw siskänti.
He doesn’t understand anything.	Jupax janiw kuns amuykiti.
He’s the first person.	Jupax nayrïr jaqiwa.
He didn’t think it was good enough for me.	Jupax janiw nayatakix askïkiti sasaw amuyäna.
It shook hot air.	Ukax junt’u thaya ch’allxtayäna.
But something came of it for me.	Ukampis nayatakix kunas ukat jutäna.
So that's what the morning is.	Ukhamajj ukajj kunaw alwajj utji.
I think people like that.	Nayax amuyta jaqinakax ukax wali askiwa.
You understand, except.	Jumax amuyasta, jan ukasti.
Overall, I’m really enjoying it.	Taqi kunat sipansa, chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
The weather was beautiful.	Suma pachax wali sumapunïnwa.
He looks thin and petite.	Jupax jisk’a ukat jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
The man was watching them.	Uka jaqejj jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
I know better than you do.	Nayajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp sum yatta.
He had seen it happen before.	Jupajj nayrajj ukham luraskäna uk uñjäna.
He went through the whole process again.	Jupajj wasitatwa taqe uka lurañanak pasäna.
Really bad, that.	Chiqpachansa jan wali, ukax.
Love it for that matter.	Munasiñampiw uka tuqitxa.
Two things can happen.	Pä kunaw pasaspa.
He tried to do things himself.	Jupa pachpaw kun lurañsa chʼamachasïna.
And yes this all really happened.	Ukat jïsa akax taqpach chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
That doesn’t mean they aren’t useful.	Ukax janiw jupanakax janiw askïkiti sañ munkiti.
A little bit, like that.	Mä juk’a, ukhama.
Do it when you want, where you want.	Kunapachatï munkta, kawkhantï munkta ukan lurañamawa.
But no one was really like that.	Ukampis janiw khitis cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
I think he will.	Jupajj ukham lurani sasaw amuyta.
He knows exactly what he wants.	Jupajj kuntï munki uk sum yati.
Or the house itself.	Jan ukajj pachpa uta.
I can’t do any more, I don’t want to do any more.	Janiw juk’amp lurañjamäkiti, janiw juk’amp lurañ munkti.
That was all there was to it.	Ukakiw ukatakejj utjäna.
It’s coming next year.	Jutïr maraw jutani.
I thought that’s what I was going to do.	Nayax ukham lurañaw sasaw amuyayäta.
It was always, always, about him.	Ukax sapa kutiw, sapa kutiw, jupat parläna.
I need some sleep.	Nayax mä juk’a ikiñ munta.
He rode carefully.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw kayuk saräna.
It was about reality.	Ukajj cheqpach toqet parläna.
He’s coming again soon.	Jupax niyaw wasitat jutani.
He understands this very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uk sum amuyi.
He definitely knows that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw uk yati.
He didn’t say anything and left the house.	Jupax janiw kuns arskänti ukat utapat sarxäna.
This here is beautiful and delicious.	Akax akanx wali suma ukat wali sumawa.
How he wanted water.	Kunjamsa uma munäna.
We died on me.	Jiwasajj nayaruw jiwjjäna.
I have nothing here.	Nayax janiw kunas akan utjkituti.
He’s very happy there.	Jupax ukanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He loved the way she was.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupajj utjäna uk wal munäna.
But tonight, no one.	Ukampis jichha arumax, janiw khitis.
It worked a few days ago.	Mä qawqha urunak nayraw irnaqäna.
There can be no secret.	Janiw kuna jamasat lurañas utjkaspati.
But he came with me.	Ukampis jupajj nayamp chikaw jutäna.
So it doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't work.	Ukhamajj janiw kawkirus sarkiti, janiw irnaqkiti.
All you can do is what you can do.	Taqi kunatix lurañjamäki ukax kuntix lurañjamäki ukawa.
They had no choice.	Jupanakajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
I usually buy the best or the best.	Nayax juk’amp suma jan ukax wali suma alañ yatta.
I can have both.	Nayax panpachaniw utjaspa.
And there will be.	Ukat utjani.
Here’s what you do.	Akax kuntix jumax lurkta ukawa.
I definitely want to buy another one.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw yaqha alañ munta.
It happened about one morning.	Ukajj niya mä alwaw pasäna.
I really didn’t know what to do with myself.	Chiqpachansa janiw naya pachpat kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
But something very strange happened.	Ukampis mä wali muspharkañ kunaw pasäna.
The same day or a few days ago.	Uka pachpa uru jan ukax mä qawqha urunak nayra.
This meant two things.	Ukajj pä toqetwa sañ munäna.
I admire him for that.	Nayax ukat juparux wali askit uñjta.
He agreed to it.	Jupajj ukaruw iyaw säna.
I’m happy for that, actually.	Nayax ukatakix kusisitaw jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
He said he would do the same.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw lurä sasaw säna.
So every time he did.	Ukhamajj sapa kutiw jupajj ukham luräna.
But weird, once.	Ukampis muspharkañawa, mä kutix.
The day after tomorrow.	Uka urux qhipürux qhipürux.
I don’t like him.	Nayax juparux janiw munkti.
He had seen it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw ukham uñjäna.
We need to do this very quickly.	Wali jankʼakiw uk lurañasa.
You can’t do something like that.	Janiw ukham kuns lurañjamäkiti.
He was very sad about it, but he did it.	Uka tuqitxa wali llakitaw jikxatasïna, ukampis uk luräna.
That is a real treat.	Ukajj cheqpach wali kusiskañawa.
In fact, she seems to be more attractive.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼamp suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.
I think it’s always nice.	Nayax amuyta sapa kutiw wali suma.
He almost certainly understands.	Jupax niya chiqpachapuniw amuyi.
Some time passed after that.	Uka qhepatjja, mä qhawqha tiempow pasäna.
I see him, every day.	Nayax jupar uñjta, sapa uru.
But also, somehow, it all works out.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw, kunjamatsa, taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
He did something very stupid.	Jupajj wali loqhe kunsa luräna.
That’s something you need.	Ukax mä kunaw jumatakix wakisi.
And we’ll see what happens .	Ukat kunas pasani uk uñjañäni .
I want to drink it.	Nayax uka umañ munta.
It would be a good idea to do so today.	Jichha tiempon ukham lurañajj wali askïspawa.
He likes that, you know.	Juparux ukham lurañax wali askiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
He was the best part of the place.	Jupax uka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
He moved here alone.	Jupax sapakiw aka chiqar sarxäna.
A bad breakfast.	Mä jan wali desayuno.
Definitely more coffee.	Chiqpachansa juk’ampi café.
I only heard of him once.	Mä kutikiw jupat istʼta.
Instead, it was.	Jan ukasti ukhamänwa.
Or well, really.	Jan ukax suma, chiqpachansa.
Maybe if you didn’t know that.	Inas jumax uk jan yatkayäta ukhaxa.
So he took them out.	Ukatwa jupanakar apsüna.
She stared at him in silence.	Jupajj amukiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
It is amazing how fast time flies.	Kunjamsa tiempojj jankʼak pasaski ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
There is a .	Ukanjja, .
And no, he doesn’t need the money.	Ukat janiwa, jupax janiw qullqix munaskiti.
I can’t stand not passing it.	Janiw jan pasañap aguantañjamäkiti.
There is a real opportunity here.	Aka chiqanx mä chiqpach oportunidad ukaw utji.
Not when it happened.	Janiw kunapachatï paskäna ukhaxa.
It was really obvious by now.	Chiqpachansa, jichhakamax qhanaw amuyasïna.
Many people do not know who he was.	Walja jaqenakajj janiw khitïnsa uk yatipkiti.
I don’t understand why.	Nayax janiw kunatsa uk amuykti.
He talked about it a lot.	Jupajj uka toqet wal parläna.
Nice and quiet.	Suma ukat amukiw.
He didn't like anything about her.	Jupajj janiw kunas jupat gustkänti.
The problem is fascinating.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj wali muspharkañawa.
And he decided not to do it.	Ukat jan uk lurañwa amtäna.
But someone did it.	Ukampis mayniw uk luratayna.
I’ve already decided.	Nayax nayratpach amtawayta.
Or I didn't know.	Jan ukajj jan yatkayätti.
It was something else again.	Ukajj wasitatwa yaqha ukhamänwa.
This is a new character.	Akax mä machaq jaqiwa.
This evening .	Jichha jayp'ux .
He was thrilled or so he thought.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna jan ukajj ukhamwa amuyäna.
I see him all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw jupar uñjta.
But that's what he wanted.	Ukampis uk jupajj munäna.
You absolutely have to do it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw lurañama.
I’m worried about myself.	Naya pachpaw llakista.
But there is still much more to improve upon.	Ukampis wali jukʼampiw jukʼamp sum lurañasa.
Ultimately, he has the responsibility.	Qhepatjja, jupaw uka lurañajj utji.
Well, we’ll do that.	Ukhama, jiwasax ukham lurañäni.
This is very difficult if you do it alone.	Ukax sapak lurasax wali ch’amawa.
It's already .	Ukajj niyaw .
He was very happy .	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna .
It seemed to fit somewhere.	Ukax kawkhans wali askïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
So do the right thing.	Ukhamajj kunatï cheqäki uk luram.
But something needs to be done.	Ukampis kuns lurañaw wakisi.
He said exactly what he said in every meeting.	Sapa tantachäwin kuntï siskäna uk sumwa arsüna.
Let’s do it again.	Wasitat lurañäni.
You want to say: .	Jumax akham sañ munta: .
For me, that’s always the moment.	Nayatakix ukax sapa kutiw uka pachanx utji.
Either or he left again.	Jan ukajj jan ukajj wasitatwa sarjjäna.
The tall man barely spoke.	Uka jachʼa jaqejj jukʼakiw parläna.
Yes of course.	Jïsa, ukhamawa.
It’s a stranger.	Ukax mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
I wanted to talk to him later.	Nayajj qhepatwa jupamp parltʼañ munta.
Also, it feels good.	Ukhamaraki, wali sumaw jikxatasi.

A nice little party.	Mä suma jisk’a fiesta.
It’s all or nothing for me.	Nayatakix taqi kunas jan ukax janiw kunas.
He agreed to go with me.	Jupajj nayamp chika sarañatakiw iyaw säna.

Now, tell me this.	Jichhax, aka yatiyapxita.
At the time, he knew everything.	Uka tiemponjja, taqe kunaw jupajj sum yatïna.

You’ve promised.	Jumaw arsuwayta.
Once every two or three days.	Mä kuti sapa pä jan ukax kimsa uru.
No one wants to tell you what to do.	Janiw khitis kuns lurañapa uk yatiyañ munkiti.
And that’s totally amazing.	Ukat ukax taqpach muspharkañawa.
This is actually very rare.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali juk’akiw utji.
It's okay that you didn't know.	Ukajj jumajj jan yatkayäta ukajj walikïskiwa.
He’s able to do a lot now.	Jupax jichhax walja lurañanak lurañ yati.
I'm thinking of it.	Nayajj ukham amuyta.
Because he said .	Kunatix jupax akham sänwa .
I feel really good today.	Chiqpachansa jichha urux wali sum jikxatastxa.
That’s the only thing you can do.	Ukakiw jumatakix wali askïspa.

He is a very nice guy .	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa .
I don't believe anything about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet kunsa creykti.
But he could not do it alone.	Ukampis janiw sapaki uk lurañ puedkänti.
But then what .	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunas .
For the first time ever.	Nayrïr kutiw utji.
That felt really good.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
I can't quite understand them.	Janiw jupanakar sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
It means everything to me.	Nayatakix taqi kun sañ muni.
I’m not like that, right now.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkti, jichhax.
And he did come.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw jutäna.
He wants to go to school with you.	Jupax jumamp chika yatiqañ utar sarañ muni.
Of course, there is a little more to it than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa mä jukʼa jukʼampiw utji.

Yes, it was that wonderful.	Jïsa, ukham wali sumapunïnwa.
The next day he came.	Qhipürux jupax jutäna.
There was one every day.	Sapa uruw maynix utjäna.
Now he could do what he had to do tonight.	Jichhajj kuntï jichha arumax lurañapäkäna uk luraspäna.
I could never do that myself.	Naya pachpajj janipuniw ukham lurirjamäkti.
He couldn't have done that.	Ukham lurasajj jupajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
It felt so sad.	Ukham llakitaw jikxatasïna.
But he was silent.	Ukampis amukiw sarnaqäna.
Or you can do something.	Jan ukajj kuns lurasma.
I needed that extra time at home.	Utan uka jukʼamp tiempow munasïna.
There’s nothing wrong with that, really.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas jan walïkiti, chiqpachansa.
He decided to go with her.	Jupampiw sarañ amtäna.
The future is good now.	Jutïr pachanx jichhax wali askiwa.

Not really, he says.	Janiw chiqpachansa, sasaw saraki.
And he always refused.	Ukat jupax sapa kutiw jan munkänti.
She certainly doesn't seem that good looking.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukham suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He wanted to control her, control her.	Jupax jupar apnaqañ munäna, juparux apnaqañ munäna.
I started eating again.	Nayax wasitat manq’añ qalltawayta.
There isn’t a great time for that.	Ukatakix janiw mä jach’a pachax utjkiti.

We have everything we need.	Taqe kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utjistu.

It never will and never will.	Janipuniw utjkaniti ukat janipuniw utjkaniti.

Do you have the same?.	¿Jumajj ukhamaraki?.
I’m both excited and sad.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa ukat llakitaw jikxatastxa.

They were separate.	Jupanakajj sapa mayniw utjäna.
He did not say how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk janiw arskänti.
But I couldn't understand why he was so afraid.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham ajjsaräna uk janiw amuykayätti.
No snowflakes, or snowflakes.	Janiw ch’uqi ch’uqi, jan ukax ch’uqi ch’uqi.
This should not be a long process.	Ukajj janiw jaya tiempo lurañapäkiti.
I’ll definitely be doing something else soon.	Chiqpachansa niyaw yaqha lurañax utjani.
You can do more or less.	Mä jukʼa jan ukajj walja lurañanak lurasma.
I never expected to get into it.	Janipuniw ukar mantañ suykayätti.
In fact, no one.	Chiqpachansa, janiw khitis.
It’s the moment you truly and completely find yourself.	Uka pachaw chiqpachapuni ukat taqpach juma pachpa jikxatasïta.
Everything that happened yesterday was still there.	Taqi kunatix qharüru luraskäna ukax wali ch’amampiw utjäna.
Whoever you are.	Khitis kunjamatsa.
I won’t go there.	Janiw uka cheqar sarkäti.
It moved very quickly.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
I just realized that.	Nayax ukhamakiw uk amuyasta.
He knows all about it.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum yati.
I knew immediately that something was wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk jankʼakiw amuyayäta.
For me, that was a wonderful experience.	Nayatakejj ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
That's what he said earlier.	Ukajj nayrajj siskäna ukawa.
I want a job.	Nayax mä irnaqäw munta.
In fact, he didn't do much.	Chiqansa, janiw sinti kuns lurkänti.
Or nobody knows.	Jan ukajj janiw khitis yatkiti.
It’s really nice and warm.	Chiqpach suma junt’u.
Do better on that next time.	Uka tuqitxa jutïr kutin jukʼamp sum lurañamawa.
And that was it.	Ukat ukajj ukhamänwa.
Not here really.	Janiw akanx chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
I don't see exactly what I want.	Nayajj janiw kuntï munkta uk sum uñjkti.
And that doesn’t really mean that.	Ukat ukax janiw chiqpachapunix ukax sañ munkiti.
It’s all very strange.	Ukax taqpach wali muspharkañawa.
Overall, a great car.	Taqi kuna, mä jach’a auto.
He could not speak at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa parlañ puedkänti.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw lurañama.
He was sleeping soundly.	Jupajj wali sum ikiskäna.
He died about three in the morning.	Ukatwa niya kimsa alwajj jiwjjäna.
Or not really at all.	Jan ukax janiw chiqpachansa janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
And that makes me really happy.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I didn’t want to get in at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa mantañ munkayätti.
But one day you know.	Ukampis mä urux jumax yatisktawa.
Someone came to me.	Mayniw nayar jutäna.
And the cold.	Ukat thaya.
I think I can’t do that.	Nayax amuyta, janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
This little house was perfect.	Aka jisk’a utax wali sumapunïnwa.
Now it’s nothing like that.	Jichhax janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
He struck twenty.	Jupax pä tunk ch’allt’äna.
Don't be afraid	Janiw uka .
And he wouldn’t leave me alone.	Ukat jupax janiw nayar jaytañ munkänti.
I don’t want to believe it.	Nayax janiw iyaw sañ munkti.
There was nothing today.	Jichhürojj janiw kunas utjkänti.
That's the latter.	Ukajj qhepatwa.
You are an adult.	Jumax mä jilïr jaqïtawa.
In fact, it happened.	Chiqansa, ukham pasäna.
A book? 	¿Mä libro?
Nothing he isn’t.	Janiw kunas jupax jan ukhamäkiti.
Now they are.	Jichhax jupanakax...
But kind of good.	Ukampis mä kasta suma.
I feel good tonight.	Jichha arumax wali sum jikxatastxa.
It’s fascinating and fascinating to me.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa ukat nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.
He was very happy to leave.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw sarjjäna.
For me, I think you'll be really happy.	Nayatakix chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta sasaw amuyta.
So, it felt good.	Ukham, wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
Maybe you should do that.	Inas jumajj ukham lurañama.
That’s how it happened.	Ukhamaw ukham pasäna.
People told me that.	Jaqenakajj uk sapjjetäna.
Let’s be completely honest here.	Aka chiqanx taqpach chiqapar uñjañäni.
But he returned almost immediately.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw uka cheqar kuttʼjjäna.
I thought it was about time.	Nayax niyaw pachax purini sasaw amuyayäta.
Now, it doesn’t exist.	Jichhax, janiw ukax utjkiti.
But why is it? 	Ukampis ¿kunatsa?
Maybe he was doing this all wrong.	Inas jupax aka tuqit taqi jan walinak luraskäna.
I don't want to do that myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
I’m alone, I’m alone.	Naya sapakiw, naya sapaki.
I'm so excited about our little .	Nayax wali kusisitaw jiwasan jisk'a .
Whoever he is, he takes good care of himself.	Khitïnsa, jupa pachpaw sum uñji.
Let’s look at that again.	Uk mayamp uñjañäni.
It feels very sad for me.	Nayatakejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I hope to see you soon.	Jankʼak uñjañ suytʼaskta.
Do what you do well.	Kuntï lurapkta uk sum lurañamawa.
He doesn't love you any more than that.	Jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munaskiti.
I don't know what will happen now.	Jichhajj kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.
To be honest, that’s not the case for me.	Chiqpachansa, ukax janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
A little bit of nothing.	Mä jisk’a jan kuna.
One day maybe more.	Mä urux inas juk’ampi.
He says he didn’t do that the other day.	Yaqha urux janiw ukham lurkti sasaw saraki.
He knew better.	Jupaw jukʼamp sum yatïna.
John did the job.	Juanajj uk luräna.
I thought that was enough .	Nayajj ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta .
I don’t remember that.	Janiw ukham amtaskti.
What's that kind of thing.	Kunas uka kasta.
And you’re good, you’re good.	Ukat jumax wali sumawa, wali sumawa.
And that in itself he appreciates.	Ukat ukax jupa pachpaw wali askit uñji.
He doesn't know exactly what time it is.	Kuna horasas uk janiw sum yatkiti.
This guy is really cool.	Aka waynax chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
I really feel bad for you.	Chiqpachansa jumatakix jan waliw jikxatastxa.
I like them better that way.	Nayajj jupanakar ukhamwa jukʼamp gustitu.
He doesn’t go to work two days a week.	Janiw pä uru irnaqäwir sarkiti.
But there was one thing .	Ukampis mä kunaw utjäna .
But it won’t be in the future.	Ukampis janiw jutïrin utjkaniti.
I know mine or.	Nayax yattwa nayan jan ukax.
It’s kind of cool.	Ukax mä kasta wali sumawa.
You can do these things.	Ukanak lurasma.
That, and some .	Uka, ukat mä qhawqha .
Time is of the essence here.	Aka chiqanx pachax wali wakiskiriwa.
There’s something, there’s something.	Kunas utji, kunas utji.
But so far it’s pretty good.	Ukampis jichhakamax wali sumawa.
He was a nice, nice guy .	Jupajj wali suma, suma jaqënwa .
She quickly looked back.	Ukat jankʼakiw wasitat uñchʼukiskäna.
He wanted to make the move.	Jupax uka sarxañ lurañ munäna.
I guess we’ll see.	Nayax uñjañäni sasaw amuyta.
There’s something there.	Kunas ukan utji.
He knew that too.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw uk yatïna.
You’re getting more and more.	Jumax juk’ampi juk’ampi.
More of those another time.	Ukanakat jukʼamp yaqha kuti.
There it is again.	Ukanx wasitatwa utji.
I can't say exactly how long.	Qhawqha tiempos uk janiw sum siskti.
A lot of things are weird.	Walja kunas muspharkañawa.
He loved to talk.	Jupajj parltʼañ wal munäna.
He didn't say his name, but he didn't say it.	Janiw sutip arskänti, ukampis janiw arskänti.
But later,	Ukampis qhepatjja, .
He said he thought it would be good for me.	Jupax nayatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta sasaw säna.
I hope so too.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw suytʼaskta.
That’s what he did, after all.	Ukhamaw jupax luratayna, taqi kunat sipansa.
Everything happened.	Taqe kunas pasäna.
That, she advised, was a pleasant surprise.	Ukajj wali suma muspharkañawa sasaw jupajj ewjjtʼäna.
He already has it all.	Jupajj niyaw taqe ukanak utji.
I’m not entirely sure how to do this.	Nayax janiw taqpach kunjams uk lurañax ukx yatkti.
I know how this guy feels.	Nayax yattwa kunjams aka waynax jikxatasi.
He’s still somewhere.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw kawkhans jikxatasi.
If they can afford to go to one.	Jupanakax mä ukar sarañatakix qullqix utjaspa ukhaxa.
He saw the wrong things.	Jupajj jan walinak uñjäna.
I just realized that problem today.	Jichhürunakan uka jan waltʼäwit jichhakiw amuyasta.
And he did it himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
I’m thinking of something.	Nayax kuns amuyta.
Sure, he could have done it.	Chiqpachansa, jupax uk luraspänwa.
Do this three times.	Kimsa kutiw ukham lurañama.
I can't say what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw siskti.
He died the other day.	Jupajj mä uruw jiwjjäna.
A really great beer.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a cerveza.
So it's now or never.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
It does it very well.	Ukjja wali sumwa luri.
There is nothing I like about it.	Ukanjja, janiw kunas nayatak askïkiti.
I think he meant it at the time.	Nayax amuyta, jupax uka pachanx uk sañ munäna.
As much as he would love to.	Kunjamtï wal munkaspa ukhama.
I didn’t say anything about him.	Janiw jupat kuns siskti.
That was two weeks ago.	Ukajj pä semana nayraw pasäna.
We needed to do that.	Jiwasax ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
Instead, he decided by force.	Jan ukasti, chʼamampiw amtäna.
He knew the best about it.	Jupaw uka toqet wali sum yatïna.
Sooner than I expected.	Suykayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp jankʼakiw.
He came, but he didn't know what to do.	Jupajj jutäna, ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
I did not know about the same thing.	Nayajj janiw uka pachpa toqet yatkayätti.
I'm going to go with you.	Nayajj jumamp chikaw sarä.
He thought he looked worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
The man didn't want him.	Uka jaqejj janiw jupar munkänti.
He definitely had something.	Jupajj cheqapuniw kunas utjäna.
So tonight will not be that night.	Ukhamajj jichha arumax janiw uka arumax utjkaniti.
I hope you do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ suyt’askta.
I prefer not to do that.	Nayajj jan uk lurañaw jukʼamp munta.
He was happier now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I rarely drink.	Nayax juk’akiw umañ yatta.
And that’s really what it comes down to.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax ukaruw puri.
It takes a lot of time to do this.	Uk lurañatakix walja tiempow munasispa.
That time is never like that.	Uka tiempojj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
And money, of course.	Ukat qullqix, chiqpachansa.
I don’t need to do that, really.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti, chiqpachansa.
Or another word.	Jan ukax yaqha aru.
It was a tiny bit better.	Ukajj mä jiskʼa jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
That was the only time he mentioned it.	Uka kutikiw uka toqet parläna.
But then there was nothing.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw kunas utjkänti.
Terrible horrible horrible.	Wali axsarkañ axsarkañ axsarkañ.
He says he’s excited to go.	Jupax wali kusisitaw sarañ munta sasaw saraki.
But, he didn't do that.	Ukampis, uk janiw jupajj lurkänti.
No one knows exactly why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
And the length of time was short.	Ukat uka jaya tiempojj mä jukʼa tiempow utjäna.
He said he didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw munkti sasaw säna.
But I have some time here.	Ukampis mä tiempow akan utjitu.
I think it was pretty quick.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali jank’akiw utjäna.
I’m going to see what’s going on.	Kunas pasaski uk uñjir sarä.
To reach him .	Jupar puriñkamax .
It was about pride.	Ukajj jachʼa jachʼa tukuñ toqetwa parläna.
That's so nice!!!.	Ukax wali sumawa!!!.
He’s been there a long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasi.
And I immediately loved it.	Ukat jankʼakiw wal munasta.
Of course, you know that.	Chiqpachansa, jumax uk yatisktawa.
But that's always where it happens.	Ukampis ukajj sapa kutiw kawkhantï pasaski.
It’s either for some reason or not.	Ukax mä kunatsa jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He didn't feel any different.	Jupajj janiw yaqha ukham amuyaskänti.
This was a film.	Akax mä película ukhamänwa.
There has never been anything like this before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham kunas utjkänti.
And he is really bad.	Ukat chiqpachansa jan wali jaqiwa.
I didn't want to come so soon.	Janiw ukham jankʼak jutañ munkayätti.
But he’s absolutely amazing.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
There is no charge to attend.	Ukar sarañatakix janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
They both know it.	Panpachaniw uk yatipxi.
You might want to talk to him directly.	Inas jupamp chika parltʼañ munsta.
And he’s always been.	Ukat jupax sapa kutiw ukham jikxatasïna.
But in this case, it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukampis aka tuqitxa, janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
What can you do now.	Jichhajj kunsa lurasma.
It began to speak again.	Ukax wasitat arsuñ qalltäna.
You want a guy like that around you.	Jumax ukham waynaruw juma jak’an munta.
What is going on here? 	¿Kunas akan pasaski?
I really want to know why.	Chiqpachansa kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
Last night .	Qhipa arumax .
So great and awesome.	Ukhama jach’a ukat wali muspharkañ.
He was gone for about a week.	Jupajj niya mä semanaw jan sarjjäna.
The sooner you can get things done, the better.	Kunanaktï jankʼak lurasma ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
That means working for us.	Ukajj jiwasatak irnaqañ sañ muni.
I’m going to get into that a little bit.	Nayax ukaruw mä juk’a mantañ munta.
It doesn’t work awesome or well.	Janiw wali muspharkañ irnaqkiti ni sum irnaqkiti.
I’ve seen him.	Nayax jupar uñjta.
You knew why.	Jumax kunatsa uk yatiyäta.
He said he couldn't do it.	Janiw uk lurirjamäkti sasaw säna.
He looked very unhappy.	Jupajj wali jan kusisit uñnaqäna.
Well, yeah, they are.	Ukhama, jïsa, jupanakax ukhamawa.
I have another beer, and he has a beer, too.	Nayax yaqha cerveza ukaniwa, ukat jupax cerveza ukaniwa, ukhamaraki.
This person doesn’t exist.	Aka jaqix janiw utjkiti.
I have no idea why, really.	Kunatsa uk janiw amuykti, chiqpachansa.
Smaller is not better.	Jiskʼa lurañajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
If you’re hungry.	Ukax manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
He said the moment was crucial.	Jupax uka pachax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw arsuwayi.
There was nothing here.	Janiw kunas akan utjkänti.
Or he didn't want to.	Jan ukajj janiw munkänti.
He’s right there in that moment.	Jupax uka pachanx chiqaw ukanx jikxatasi.
I asked one last time.	Nayax mä qhipa kutiw jiskt’asta.
One can’t do it.	Mä janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He did it the following year.	Jupajj qhepa maraw ukham luräna.
The whole time the weather was perfect.	Taqi uka tiempox pachax wali sumapunïnwa.
He knows what is right.	Jupajj kunas cheqäki uk sum yati.
He said he stayed there for an hour.	Ukanjja, mä horaw qheparäna sasaw säna.
See for yourself!.	¡Juma pachpa uñjañäni!.
It also can’t be done.	Ukhamaraki janiwa lurañjamäkiti.
Not that there was an opportunity before that.	Janiw uka nayrajj mä oportunidad utjkänti sañ munkiti.
Gentle, but delicious.	Llamp’u, ukampis wali suma.
I’m doing it all right again.	Nayax wasitat taqi ukanak sum luraskta.
Maybe I didn't know the word or something.	Inas uka aru jan ukajj kunsa jan yatkayätti.
Great red blood.	Jach’a wila wila.
But I am glad he did.	Ukampis ukham luratapat wal kusista.
He had nothing to do here.	Jupax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkänti.
I really want to do something about it.	Uka toqet kuns lurañ wal munta.
Of course, it doesn’t really matter now.	Chiqansa, jichhax janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.
He seems kind enough.	Jupajj suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
I was afraid of everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa ajjsarayäta.
He just called it.	Jupax ukhamakiw jawsäna.
The past is always there.	Nayra pachax sapa kutiw utji.
More needs to be done for this.	Ukatakix juk’amp lurañaw wakisi.
I don’t want to go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarañ munkti.
And that’s exactly what’s happening here and now.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw kunatix akan ukat jichhax luraski ukax ukhamawa.
He was a different person now.	Jichhajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
That is what you want to do.	Ukaw jumajj lurañ munta.
We’re a big.	Jiwasax mä jach’a.
He didn't mean it that well.	Jupajj janiw ukham sum sañ munkänti.
He had no idea who she was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk janiw amuykänti.
He did things himself.	Jupa pachpaw kuns luräna.
That’s what he’s okay with.	Ukax jupax walikïskiwa.
The eyes of the snowflakes.	Nayra ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Nothing works right now.	Jichhax janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
You look amazing.	Jumax muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
How I see things.	Kunjamsa nayax yänak uñjta.
Honestly, that’s really not the case.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Not you again.	Janiw jumajj mayampsa.
When, and with whom, he wasn’t sure.	Kunapachas, ukat khitimpis uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Now , the	Jichhax .
Everyone loved it.	Taqeniw ukajj munasïna.
The husband loved it.	Chachax walpun munasïna.
I feel so bad already.	Nayax wali jan waliw jikxatastxa niyaw.
There was no charge for this.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna qullqis utjkänti.
There is no charge here.	Aka chiqanx janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
Or he just had it.	Jan ukajj jupar ukhamakiw utjäna.
He really took care of it.	Chiqpachansa wali sum uñjäna.
You’re in immediate danger.	Jumax jank’akiw jan walt’äwin jikxatastaxa.
He wants to know everything that happened.	Jupajj taqe kunatï paskäna uk yatiñwa muni.
But he didn't want to do that to her.	Ukampis janiw jupamp ukham lurañ munkänti.
It is immediately .	Ukajj jankʼakiw .
But the problem went on its own.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj jupa pachpaw saräna.
Yes, he was very happy.	Jïsa, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But that’s a good thing.	Ukampis ukax walikïskiwa.
There was nothing worse to do.	Janiw jukʼamp jan walinak lurañajj utjkänti.
Twenty years later, that was not the case.	Pä tunka mara qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
But he looks happier.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp kusisit uñnaqaniwa.
She is looking forward to getting married.	Jupajj casarasiñatak wal suytʼaski.
He stayed the night.	Jupajj uka arumaw qheparäna.
So it was now or never, he thought.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I definitely don’t understand all that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw janiw taqi ukanak amuykti.
Actually pretty quick then.	Chiqansa wali jank’akiw ukat.
He’s the wrong kind of person.	Jupax jan wali kasta jaqiwa.
Now there was no reason.	Jichhajj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
There’s one for each.	Ukanx sapa mayniw maynix utji.
So far everything has been quiet.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasïna.
You’re obviously excited about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta, ukax qhanawa.
And the weather was perfect.	Ukat pachax wali sumapunïnwa.
But that was twofold.	Ukampis ukajj pä kutiw utjäna.
This is really important.	Chiqpachansa akax wali wakiskiriwa.
I knew what could happen that night.	Uka arumax kunas pasaspa uk sum yatiyäta.
He knew it for years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw uk yatïna.
I understand why I want to do this.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ munta uk sum amuyta.
It doesn’t mean a consensus.	Janiw mä amtar puriñ sañ munkiti.
The people are very friendly.	Jaqinakax wali suma jaqiwa.
But what it is doing.	Ukampis kunatï luraski ukajja.
I really don’t say that often.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham sapa kuti siskti.
That was never the case, you have to do that.	Ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti, ukham lurañamawa.
He made hot coffee.	Jupax junt’u café luratayna.
You’re in the same situation yourself.	Juma pachpaw pachpa jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
But that is not very useful.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti askïkiti.
It needs to be done well.	Suma lurañaw wakisi.
He didn't like that.	Ukham lurasajj janiw jupar gustkänti.
He’s a real nice guy, you know.	Jupax chiqpach suma jaqiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
I love what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta uk walpun munasta.
In fact, there is no need to do anything.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas lurañax wakiskiti.
Nothing could be more important than this.	Janiw kunas aka tuqitx juk’amp wakiskir tuqitx utjkaspati.
It’s exactly what you want.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kuntix jumax munkta ukhama.
And how he appreciated books.	Ukat kunjamsa libronak wali askit uñjäna.
I know, she said.	Nayax yattwa, sasaw jupax säna.
I never saw him go with anyone.	Janipuniw jupar khitimpis sarañ uñjkti.
Three at a time, one alone.	Kimsa mä kutix, maynix sapakiw.
It wanted better.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumwa munäna.
It seemed unreal.	Ukajj janis cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
You can only do this once.	Mä kutikiw uk lurasma.
These happened less than a year ago.	Ukanakax janïr mä mara nayraw pasäna.
Something felt very intense.	Kunas wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
So we have two things to do.	Ukhamajj pä lurañaw utjistu.
She wanted to do better than him.	Jupat sipansa jukʼamp sum lurañwa munäna.
He was the only one who thought of it.	Jupa sapakiw amuyäna, ukatwa ukham luräna.
But that would be a good thing, but it would be worth it.	Ukampis ukajj wali askïspawa, ukampis ukajj wali askïspawa.
I didn't understand it myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw uk amuykayätti.
You’ll be very happy.	Wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
I feel really good.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wali sum jikxatastxa.
That was probably the case.	Ukajj inas ukhamänwa.
He is my	Jupajj nayan .
I don’t know what’s coming after me.	Janiw yatkti kunas nayat qhepat jutani.
But in this case it is interesting.	Ukampis aka tuqitxa wali askiwa.
That there was none of that after all.	Ukax janiw kunas ukax utjkänti taqi kunat sipansa.
Is that all you need to do.	¿Ukax taqpach lurañax wakisispati.
Twice I knew something, but he didn’t say anything.	Pä kutiw kuns yatiyäta, ukampis janiw kuns arskänti.
Not until now it wasn’t.	Janiw jichhakamax janiw ukhamäkänti.
It is so obvious.	Ukham qhanaw uñjasi.
I don't know anything else.	Janiw kuns yatkti, juk'ampi.
He’s awesome, actually.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.
It would be better than nothing.	Jan kunas utjki ukat sipansa jukʼamp askïspawa.
It never, ever, ever works.	Janipuniw, janipuniw, janipuniw irnaqkiti.
I'm still important.	Nayajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Or it wouldn’t exist.	Jan ukax janiw utjkaspati.
He was just so moved.	Jupajj ukhamakiw chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
I said the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw säna.
I don't know anyone in prison.	Janiw khitirus carcelan uñt'kti.
I didn't realize that at the time.	Uka tiemponjja janiw uk amuykayätti.
But that happened later.	Ukampis ukajj qhepatwa pasäna.
He’s actually kind of nice.	Jupax chiqpachansa mä juk’a suma jaqiwa.
We’ll do it on the spot.	Jiwasax uka chiqan lurañäni.
And all sorts of things.	Ukat taqi kasta.
But other than that, he didn't know it.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa, janiw uk yatkänti.
I think you can too.	Nayax amuyta, jumax ukhamarakiw lurasma.
I really want it a lot.	Chiqpachansa walpun munta.
I’ve always hoped it would.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukax utjani sasaw suyt’ta.
But it's not what he wants.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jupajj munki ukhamäkiti.
Ten years ago, I don't remember anything.	Tunka mara nayrajj janiw kunatsa amtaskti.
I can make love to you.	Nayajj jumamp munasiñampiw lurasma.
Multitasking is important.	Walja lurañanak lurañax wali wakiskiriwa.
I have several times.	Nayax walja kutiw utjitu.
But not enough, it seems.	Ukampis janiw wakiskiti, ukhamaw amuyasi.
Thirty ten tens.	Kimsa tunka tunka.
How will he do this? 	¿Kunjamsa jupajj uk lurani?
So it doesn't seem like it can be done.	Ukhamajj janiw lurañjamäkaspas ukhamäkiti.
I still understand all of this.	Nayajj wali sumwa taqe ukanakat amuyasta.
It is assumed that this will always be the case.	Ukax sapa kutiw utjani sasaw amuyasi.
And it is difficult to do so.	Ukat uk lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
He takes things seriously.	Jupajj kunanaktï wali askit uñji.
You know everything about you.	Jumajj taqe kunwa jumat yatta.
Money is more important of course.	Qullqi tuqitx juk’amp wakiskiriwa chiqpachansa.
In fact, it was a regular day.	Chiqansa, ukax mä sapa uruw utjäna.
That’s all he did.	Ukakiw ukham luräna.
But this time it really feels like us.	Ukampis aka kutix chiqpachapuniw jiwasax ukham amuyasi.
Home a few days ago.	Uta mä qawqha urunak nayra.
But that one did.	Ukampis uka mayniw ukham luräna.
He was a very sincere man.	Jupajj wali taqe chuyma jaqënwa.
I don’t want to eat it, of course.	Nayax janiw manq’añ munkti, chiqpachansa.
If you need something, you let me know.	Jumax kunas munasma, jumax yatiyapxita.
The money has nothing to do with it.	Uka qullqix janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
They are all .	Jupanakajj taqeniw .
It did the job perfectly.	Ukajj wali sumwa uka trabajo luräna.
I mean now.	Nayax jichhax sañ munta.
Let’s see what you can do wrong.	Kunsa jan walinak lurasma uk uñjañäni.
This wasn’t me.	Akax janiw nayax ukhamäkänti.
A letter from me.	Nayat mä carta.
It’s a cold and windy night.	Mä thaya ukat thaya arumaw utji.
Things aren’t too bad.	Kunanakas janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
I still have every one.	Nayax wali sapa mayniw utjitu.
I’ve planned it all out.	Nayax taqi ukanak amtawayta.
Every day but today is good.	Sapa uru ukampis jichhürunakanx wali askiwa.
Just like this one!.	¡Ukhamarakiw akax ukham!.
There was more than enough time.	Uka tiempojj jukʼampiw utjäna.
Not a nice guy by any means.	Janiw mä suma waynax kuna tuqitsa.
You can do it right now.	Jichhakiw uk lurasma.
The wrong kind.	Uka jan wali kasta.
He doesn’t know exactly.	Jupax janiw sum yatkiti.
Everything scares him.	Taqi kunas juparux wal axsarayi.
I would love to see him again.	Jupar wasitat uñjañ wal munta.
Now, that’s .	Jichhax, ukax .
He asked me to his house several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw utapar sarañatak mayïtu.
He decided to do so.	Jupajj ukaruw amtäna.
Therefore, he was very surprised.	Ukatwa jupajj wal muspharäna.
I'm going to take it out tomorrow.	Nayax qharüruw ukanak apsuñ munta.
Contrary to what he said.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna ukat sipansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
The problem is that .	Uka jan waltʼäwejj .
Good but not necessary.	Suma ukampis jan wakiskiriwa.
Now it’s time to move.	Jichhax sarnaqañ pachaw purini.
There aren’t two nights.	Janiw pä arumax utjkiti.
I want to do that in the future.	Nayax jutïrin ukham lurañ munta.
They are called snowflakes.	Jupanakax ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi satawa.
We just have to do that.	Jiwasax ukhamakiw ukham lurañasa.
I need to do this soon.	Nayax jank’akiw uk lurañax wakisi.
I feel much better today.	Jichhürunakanjja, jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasta.
It was now or never, he thought.	Jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti, sasaw amuyäna.
He gave me a gift.	Jupaw mä churitu.
I want him, yeah.	Nayax juparux munta, jïsa.
Good beer that is.	Suma cerveza ukaxa.
He always seems to want to eat.	Jupax sapa kutis manq’añ munkaspa ukhamawa.
You know, like that.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukhama.
They were beautiful, they were beautiful.	Wali sumawa, wali sumawa.
You'll be fine for a while.	Mä juk'a pachax wali sumaw jikxatasïta.
I immediately said yes.	Nayajj jankʼakiw jïsa sasaw sista.
You know, about the rules.	Jumax yatisktawa, kamachinak tuqit.
A couple of times.	Mä pä kuti.
But it’s not enough.	Ukampis janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He had no way of knowing.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa yatkänti.
All of these, or nearly so.	Taqi ukanakax, jan ukax niya ukhama.
He had a good time with it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa wali sum pasäna.
But that was so long ago.	Ukampis ukham nayrajj ukhamänwa.
Let’s imitate them.	Jupanakar uñtasit lurañäni.
I personally see that well.	Naya pachpaw ukham sum uñjta.
And that lasted a long time.	Ukat ukajj walja tiempow utjäna.
I just started here.	Nayax jichhakiw akan qalltawayta.
So there is a big reason.	Ukhamajj mä jachʼa kunatsa utji.
But let’s see what happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
I think there’s still a lot of room for this.	Nayax amuyta akax wali jach’a chiqaw utji.
Here, that and so .	Akax, uka ukat ukhama .
He’s a complete stranger.	Jupax taqpach jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
He didn't have that, he realized.	Ukajj janiw jupan utjkänti, sasaw amuyasïna.
He works quietly and quickly.	Jupax amukiw jank’akiw irnaqäna.
There is nothing wrong with doing it.	Janiw kuna lurañas jan askïkiti.
I asked him what he liked best.	Ukat kunas juparux jukʼamp gusti sasaw jisktʼta.
But something isn’t right.	Ukampis kunas janiw walïkiti.
You know how these go .	Ukanakax kunjamsa saraski uk jumax yatisktawa .
He obviously didn’t want to do that.	Jupax qhanaw jan ukham lurañ munkänti.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Jupax sarañ munäna, sasaw sitäna.
I saw him there myself.	Naya pachpaw ukan jupar uñjta.
Except they’re better.	Jan ukasti jupanakax juk’amp askiwa.
It can happen to everyone.	Taqiniruw pasaspa.
But tell me about it.	Ukampis uka toqet yatiyapjjeta.
I think that’s amazing.	Nayax amuyta ukax muspharkañawa.
I didn’t know how.	Nayax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkayätti.
We'll see what's better later.	Qhepatjja, kunas jukʼamp askïspa uk uñjañäni.
Nothing needs to be done at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.
It doesn't matter what happened.	Kunatï paskäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He can do better than I can.	Jupajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa luraspa.
He’s the new rich man.	Jupax machaq qamir jaqiwa.
I’ll go anywhere with you.	Nayax jumamp chikaw kawkirus sarä.
She was thrilled, she said.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, sasaw jupajj säna.
No one knows where it will lead.	Kawkirus purini uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
And it’s really pretty.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
It was like this for a long time.	Walja tiempow ukham sarnaqäna.
But then he was a different person.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, jupajj yaqha jaqënwa.
It’s very slow and a bit long.	Ukax wali llamp’u ukat mä juk’a jaya.
That’s all I know.	Ukax taqi kunatix nayax yatkta ukawa.
So what is the problem?.	Ukhamajj ¿kuna jan waltʼäwis utji?.
He will do it tomorrow.	Qharüruw uk lurani.
But a little more needed to be done.	Ukampis mä jukʼamp lurañaw wakisïna.
He wants to make wine in the future.	Jupajj jutïrin vino lurañwa munta.
And it’s very clear.	Ukat wali qhanawa.
So we went to a hospital and .	Ukatwa mä hospitalar sarapjjta ukat .
I didn’t get anything from anyone.	Janiw khitirus kuns jikxatkti.
It was beautiful and that was it.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa ukat ukhamänwa.
I want to talk to him now.	Jichhajj jupampiw parltʼañ munta.
I am an old man who cares more than anyone can imagine.	Nayra jaqïtwa, khitis amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼampiw llakista.
I decided to quit at that point.	Uka pachan jaytañ amtawayta.
He wanted nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunsa munkänti.
I feel it again.'	Nayajj wasitatwa jikjjatasta’ sasa.
Do whatever you want with me.	Kuntï jumajj munkta uk nayamp chika luram.
We all have our own problem.	Taqeniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjistu ukajja.
Low cost isn’t always best.	Jisk’a qullqix janiw sapa kutix wali askïkiti.
The past doesn’t work that way.	Nayra pachax janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
He felt surprisingly good.	Jupajj muspharkañ wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He has to do it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk lurañapa.
They are the best way to do that.	Jupanakax ukham lurañatakix wali askiwa.
He was a man of the time.	Jupajj uka tiempon jaqënwa.
It was such a long time ago.	Ukham nayra tiempos ukhamänwa.
He controls the game.	Jupaw uka anattʼañ apnaqi.
I am looking forward to that.	Ukaruw suytʼaskta.
Let’s have some breakfast.	Mä juk’a desayuno lurañäni.
But it really was.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
Now he was on his own.	Jichhajj jupajj sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
Or at least that money.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa uka qollqe.
He’s no better.	Jupax janiw juk’amp askïkiti.
It was not something that had always happened.	Janiw kunatï nayratpach paskäna ukajj ukhamäkänti.
Eating is very difficult.	Manq’añax wali ch’amawa.
It’s our .	Ukax jiwasan .
He was surprised himself.	Jupa pachpaw wal muspharäna.
I’d like to say more about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx juk’amp arsuñ munta.
And he looked at her.	Ukat jupar uñjäna.
But it doesn’t work at all.	Ukampis janiw kunatsa irnaqkiti.
There is the.	Ukanx uka...
Still some time to go.	Wali mä juk’a pachaw sarañax utji.
I'd rather do it fast.	Nayajj jankʼak lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
It is beautiful and quiet.	Ukajj wali sumawa ukat amukiw jikjjatasi.
Of course, not many people are good at it.	Chiqansa, janiw walja jaqinakax sum lurañ yatipkiti.
So he was just lying there.	Ukhamajj ukhamakiw ikiskäna.
He looks very bad.	Jupax wali jan wali uñnaqaniwa.
He wanted some air.	Jupax mä juk’a thaya munäna.
I want to go out with him.	Nayax jupamp chikaw mistuñ munta.
Is it necessary to do something wrong?.	¿Jan walinak lurañajj wakisispati?.
There is no real money.	Janiw chiqpach qullqix utjkiti.
You were the one he finished.	Jumaw jupax tukuyäna.
He was doing a good job with her.	Jupampiw mä suma irnaqäw luraskäna.
No one is here, he said.	Janiw khitis akan utjkiti, sasaw säna.
I still have somewhere.	Nayax waliw kawkhans utjitu.
It was, it was wonderful.	Ukhamänwa, wali sumapunïnwa.
He probably wanted food.	Jupajj inas manqʼa munpachäna.
It’s best not to go there now.	Jichhax jan uka chiqar sarañax wali askiwa.
I saw nothing but blood.	Janiw kuns uñjkti jan ukasti wila.
But it almost doesn't matter.	Ukampis niyaw ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
It’s always a news moment.	Ukax sapa kutiw mä yatiyäw pachax utji.
I didn't want help.	Janiw yanaptʼa munkayätti.
So far, he has refused to comment on the matter.	Jichhakamax janiw uka tuqit kuns arsuñ munkiti.
He didn't know any more than I did.	Jupajj janiw nayat sipansa jukʼamp yatkänti.
She knew pretty much what he thought about it.	Uka toqet kunsa jupajj amuyäna uk niyaw sum yatïna.
He didn’t know how to do the real thing.	Jupax janiw kunjams chiqpach yänak lurañ yatkänti.
This is a lovely snowflake.	Akax mä munat ch’uqi satawa.
I’m not entirely surprised by this.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit taqpach muspharkayätti.
They are already .	Jupanakax niya .
We need to do this more often.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp kutiw uk lurañasa.
I have seen him before.	Nayajj jupar nayraw uñjta.
I didn't want to get involved.	Janiw nayajj ukar mantañ munkayätti.
So it doesn't work well.	Ukhamajj janiw sum lurkiti.
He told them so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham jupanakar yatiyäna.
I haven’t had a chance to do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurañatakix mä ch’am jikxatkti.
I didn't want to say any more.	Janiw jukʼamp sañ munkayätti.
He talked about it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uka toqet parläna.
But it is still going strong.	Ukampis wali chʼamampiw saraski.
I know how that feels.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
In fact, there is not a single problem.	Chiqansa, janiw mä jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Until it’s bad.	Jisk’a jan wali.
He wants to know the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk yatiñwa muni.
I’m still enjoying it.	Nayax wali kusiskañawa.
I didn't know why very well.	Janiw kunatsa wal sum yatkayätti.
No one is working.	Janiw khitis irnaqkiti.
Fortunately, that was not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj wali askiwa.
So far, no one has figured it out.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis amuykiti.
And he 's .	Ukat jupajj .
It came to him later.	Ukajj qhepatwa jupar purinïna.
This is the latter.	Akax qhipa uñtatawa.
It feels very uncomfortable.	Ukax wali jan waliw jikxatasi.
And he would do it.	Ukat jupajj uk luraspänwa.
He seemed so genuine.	Jupajj wali cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He had always wanted to go there.	Jupajj nayratpachaw ukar sarañ munäna.
I have felt this way for a long time.	Walja tiempow ukham jikjjatasta.
Don't do too much, too soon.	Janiw sinti lurañamäkiti, sinti jankʼakiw lurañama.
He couldn't do it again.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa uk lurañ puedkänti.
When he died, she died with him.	Jupajj jiwjjäna ukhajja, jupamp chikaw jiwjjäna.
And that is what he thought.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
He said yes, he did.	Jupajj jïsa, sasaw säna.
I don’t want to tell you just yet.	Janiw jichhak yatiyañ munkti.
He didn't want to say anything .	Jupajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti .
He told her this several times.	Ukjja walja kutiw jupar säna.
He meant something, something, something.	Jupax kuns sañ munäna, kunas, kunas sañ munäna.
Please let me know.	Ukhamajj nayarojj yatiyapjjeta.
But he knew how to keep a secret.	Ukampis kunjamsa mä jamasat yatiyañ yatïna.
They didn't like it at all.	Jupanakajj janiw kuns gustkänti.
I felt that way, you know.	Nayax ukham jikxatasiyäta, jumax yatisktawa.
There he was alone.	Ukanx sapakiw utjäna.

Now he could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.	Jichhajj kunjamtï munkäna uk luraspänwa, kunapachatï munkäna ukhajj luraspänwa.
There is still silence.	Wali amukiw utji.

Can’t do it of course.	Janiw lurañjamäkiti chiqpachansa.

There was every one of them.	Ukanjja sapa mayniw utjäna.
I didn't want to go out at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa mistuñ munkänti.
I have felt this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham jikjjatasta.

He listened to them and didn't want anything.	Jupanakar istʼasajj janiw kuns munkänti.
There, I feel sad.	Ukanjja, llakitaw jikjjatasta.
At any given moment he didn’t understand anything.	Kuna pachas jupax janiw kuns amuyaskänti.

That is not the case.	Ukham lurañajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or it was something else.	Jan ukajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
There is no charge for this.	Ukax janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
Another kind of.	Yaqha kasta.
There was no past, no future.	Janiw nayra pachax utjkänti, janiw jutïr pachax utjkänti.

Someone goes to the wrong house, big day or not.	Maynix jan wali utar sarxi, jach’a uru jan ukax jan.
But it really is.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
He had no idea, in the long run.	Jupajj janiw kuns amuykänti, jaya tiemponjja, janiw uk amuykänti.
He already knew it.	Jupajj niyaw yatïna.
We just can’t do that.	Jiwasax janiw ukax lurañjamäkiti.
They were very cold.	Wali wali thaya.
Honestly, it's rather surprising.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
It did just that.	Ukajj ukhamakiw luräna.
At the time, I thought she was much more attractive.	Uka tiemponjja, jupajj jukʼamp suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.

There was no hospitalization.	Ukanjja, janiw hospitalar sarañajj utjkänti.
And he likes everybody.	Ukat jupax taqiniruw gusti.
He thinks he knows everything.	Jupax taqi kun yattwa sasaw amuyi.
Of course, he doesn’t.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
Very rarely at that time.	Wali jan sinti uka tiemponjja.

He knew immediately who it was.	Khitis uk jankʼakiw yatïna.
I wonder what will happen next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani sasaw jisktʼasta.
But he still loved it.	Ukampis jupax wali munasiñampiw sarnaqäna.
It’s very clear, it’s very dark.	Wali qhanawa, wali ch’amawa.
Money or no money.	Qullqi jan ukax jan qullqi.

He has something about him that I like.	Jupax kunaw jupat utji, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I had no idea what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
And, yes, it’s delicious.	Ukat, jïsa, wali sumawa.

Not this year, of course.	Janiw jichha marax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
As it happened, no one noticed.	Kunjamtï paskäna ukhamajj janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
You have to do one or the other.	Mä jan ukax yaqha lurañaw wakisi.

He took the initiative.	Jupaw nayrïr kutix kuns luräna.
No one but you, you know that.	Janiw khitis jumat sipansa, jumajj uk yatisktawa.
I never needed to do such a thing.	Janipuniw ukham jan walinak lurañax wakiskänti.

I don’t do that at all.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa ukham lurkti.
I wonder what that was about.	Kuna tuqitsa ukajj utjäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
He gave her a cup of coffee, which she wanted.	Jupajj mä café churäna, ukajj jupajj munäna.
There will be these.	Ukanakaw utjani.

It is readily available.	Ukajj jankʼakiw jikjjatasi.
It takes money for it.	Ukatakix qullqi munaraki.
So let’s see what happened.	Ukhamajj kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
This is rather obvious.	Ukajj jukʼamp qhanawa.
And that’s all very well.	Ukat ukax taqpach wali askiwa.
But this guy was great.	Ukampis aka waynax wali sumapunïnwa.
Of course, this was not necessary at all.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw kunjamatsa wakiskänti.
He almost doesn't know any better.	Niya janiw jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
He later refused to confess to the crime.	Qhepatjja, janiw uka jan wali luratapat arsuñ munkänti.
What he’s got.	Kunas jupax jikxatasi.
bad.	qhuru.
But he doesn't understand it.	Ukampis janiw uk sum amuykiti.
I did better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurawayta.
So you don't have to do too much.	Ukhamajj janiw sinti kuns lurañajj wakiskiti.
Well that’s kind of weird.	Wali ukax mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
I personally saw that slightly faster arrival.	Naya pachpaw uka jiskʼa jukʼamp jankʼak puriñ uñjta.
Yes, of course .	Jïsa, chiqpachansa .
It doesn't take much to do.	Ukatakejj janiw walja lurañajj wakiskiti.
There is no future, no past.	Janiw jutïr pachax utjkiti, janiw nayra pachax utjkiti.
Don't do too much, do it fast.	Janiw sinti lurañamäkiti, jankʼakiw lurañama.
But there isn't much time left.	Ukampis janiw walja tiempojj utjkiti.
But I had something of my own.	Ukampis naya pachpaw kunas utjäna.
I want to take full control of that.	Nayax uka tuqit taqpach apnaqañ munta.
He was clearly enjoying the whole thing.	Jupajj taqe ukanak uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That’s nothing .	Ukax janiw kunas .
I never wanted him anyway.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa jupar munkayätti.
It doesn't matter what you want.	Kuntï munkta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
Anyway, that’s it.	Kawkhansa, ukax ukhamawa.
This had only happened once before.	Ukajj nayrajj mä kutikiw pasäna.
He loves her very much.	Juparux wali munasiñampiw uñji.
Of course, he wanted to do things right.	Chiqansa, jupax kuns sum lurañ munäna.
It is available to everyone.	Ukajj taqeniw utji.
Or almost home.	Jan ukajj niyaw utar puri.
If you want to do something, do it exactly what you want.	Kun lurañsa munsta ukhajja, kuntï munkta uk sum lurañamawa.
No, he didn't want that to happen.	Janiwa, janiw ukham pasañap munkänti.
More, more, more.	Juk’ampi, juk’ampi, juk’ampi.
I saw the best night.	Nayax wali suma arumax uñjta.
That was about twenty years ago.	Ukajj niya pä tunka mara nayraw pasäna.
And this is as it should be.	Ukat akax kunjamtï lurañapäki ukhama.
But, what’s the point.	Ukampis, kunas uka tuqitxa.
It’s a surprise .	Ukax mä muspharkañawa .
Same old, same old.	Pachpa nayra, pachpa nayra.
I don’t remember, too early.	Janiw amtaskti, wali nayra.
Everything happened very quietly.	Taqi kunas wali amukiw pasäna.
Why, I don't	Kunatsa, janiw .
But that's just what it takes.	Ukampis ukajj kunatï wakiski ukakiw wakisi.
Maybe he bought a house.	Inas mä uta alasïna.
Here’s what you need for breakfast.	Akax kunatix desayuno lurañatakix wakiski ukawa.
He knew how to behave.	Kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatïna.
The boy didn’t understand.	Uka waynax janiw amuyaskänti.
So I ask you this question.	Ukatwa aka jisktʼajj jumar jisktʼasta.
He was once a human being.	Jupajj nayrajj jaqënwa.
Let’s be honest about one thing.	Mä tuqit chiqapar uñjañäni.
He knew what he had to do here.	Jupajj kunsa akan lurañap yatïna.
A middle ground, maybe.	Mä chika chiqa, inas.
But I know exactly where everything is.	Ukampis kawkhantï taqe kunas utjki uk sum yatta.
It happened without love.	Ukajj jan munasiñampiw pasäna.
I am going to do my homework.	Nayajj tareanak lurañwa saraskta.
That's all they have.	Ukakiw jupanakajj utji.
So let's look at that now.	Ukhamajj jichhajj ukanak uñjañäni.
I wonder where he got that.	Kawkitsa uk apsüna sasaw jisktʼasta.
So do it, please.	Ukhamajj luram.
Please don’t say no to that.	Mä juk’a pachax janiw ukax janiw sañ muni.
I didn’t anticipate this, but I had to.	Nayax janiw uk nayratpach amuyirïkti, jan ukasti ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
I always tried to do the right thing.	Sapa kutiw kunatï cheqäki uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He did come to me.	Jupajj cheqapuniw nayar jutäna.
He wasn't sure why, but .	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkänti, ukampis .
It’s not bad, at all.	Janiw jan walïkiti, janipuniw.
He’s a surprise.	Jupax mä muspharkañawa.
That's what I'm fine with.	Ukajj nayajj walikïskiwa.
It is all you can do.	Ukajj taqe kuntï lurañjamäki ukawa.
One night house.	Mä arumax uta.
I want to drive.	Nayax auto apnaqañ munta.
But for me .	Ukampis nayatakejj .
I can't remember how much after that.	Uka qhepatjja, qhawqha qollqsa uk janiw amtaskti.
So you have to do everything.	Ukhamajj taqe kunsa lurañamawa.
A very good year indeed.	Mä wali suma mara chiqpachansa.
I mean myself.	Naya pachpaw sañ munta.
I wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Kunsa jupajj lurani uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
And he shook it off.	Ukat jupax ch’allxtayäna.
I want to see him a lot.	Nayax jupar wal uñjañ munta.
It has nothing to do with me now.	Jichhax janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.
But then again .	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa .
Let’s do it now.	Jichhax uk lurañäni.
You are a very cruel person.	Jumax wali qhuru jaqïtawa.
He didn't do it alone.	Jupajj janiw sapaki uk lurkänti.
It turned out to be beyond reality.	Ukajj kunatï cheqäki ukat sipansa jukʼampiw jikjjatasïna.
And it can happen anywhere.	Ukat kawkhansa pasaspa.
He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uka toqet jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
I want to talk to him again.	Nayax wasitat jupamp parltʼañ munta.
Part less, part more.	Mä chikat jisk’a, mä chikat juk’ampi.
He will do everything that needs to be done.	Jupaw taqe kuntï lurañajj wakiski uk lurani.
It had to be done.	Ukajj lurañwa wakisïna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kunas walïkiti.
And they’re real still.	Ukat jupanakax chiqpach wali.
I rarely see this used.	Nayax juk’akiw aka apnaqañ uñjta.
He’s been having a lot of fun lately.	Jupax aka qhipa urunakanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I’m so excited!.	¡Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa!.
I mean the cold part.	Nayax thaya chiqaw sañ munta.
I want to come with you.	Nayajj jumamp chik jutañ munta.
He knew better anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa jukʼamp sum yatïna.
But everything though.	Ukampis taqi kunas ukampis.
Maybe he didn't want to do that.	Inas jan ukham lurañ munpachäna.
That’s all he did.	Ukakiw jupajj luräna.
I haven’t known it in a long time.	Nayax janiw jaya pachaw ukar uñt’kti.
You know he likes it.	Jumax yatisktawa juparux gusti.
You are a very strong person.	Jumax wali qhuru jaqiwa.
Cold, it really was.	Thaya, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
But this wasn’t in the past.	Ukampis akax janiw nayra pachan utjkänti.
I don't understand him.	Nayajj janiw jupar amuykti.
He was and always has been a wonderful person.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa ukat taqe tiempojj wali suma jaqënwa.
And for two days there was nothing.	Ukat pä urux janiw kunas utjkänti.
I think a lot yes.	Nayax walpun amuyta jïsa.
And he shook it.	Ukat ukaruw chʼalljjtayasïna.
I think he loved it.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali munasiñampiw jikxatasïna.
Something else is necessary.	Yaqha kunaw wakisi.
That in itself was very telling.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw wali yatiyäna.
I had no choice but to do as he said.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti, jan ukasti kunjamtï siskäna ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
After all, that’s about it.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukaw uka tuqitxa.
I think what’s here is interesting.	Nayax amuyta, kunatix akan utjki ukax wali askiwa.
Or really nothing at all.	Jan ukax chiqpachansa janiw kunas utjkaspati.
I really think that’s it.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamawa sasaw amuyta.
Then he went home again.	Ukat wasitat utar kuttʼjjäna.
Built house three years ago.	Kimsa mara nayraw uta lurawayi.
She felt love for him when she saw him.	Jupar uñjasajj wali munasiñampiw jikjjatasïna.
Everybody knows about it, everybody knows.	Taqinipuniw uka tuqit yatipxi, taqiniw yatipxi.
I want to walk in you.	Nayax jumanakan sarnaqañ munta.
He didn't want to do that to me.	Jupajj nayarojj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
You can’t do it alone.	Janiw sapakix lurañjamäkiti.
But, no, she couldn’t tell him.	Ukampis, janiw, janiw jupar yatiyañ puedkänti.
What's the matter with you .	Kunas jumarux .
One may or may not .	Maynix inas jan ukax .
He was alone here.	Jupax sapakiw akan jikxatasïna.
There is still some truth.	Wali mä juk’a chiqaw utji.
Because if he does that.	Kunatix jupax ukham luraspa ukhaxa.
Honestly, why not.	Chiqpachansa, kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
There is nothing wrong with that .	Ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti .
These he did immediately.	Ukanakax jank’akiw lurawayi.
He really wants to help.	Chiqpachansa yanaptʼañ muni.
I’m feeling better, actually.	Nayax juk’amp sumaw jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
He asked what time it was.	Ukat kuna horasas uk jisktʼäna.
They’re pretty good about it.	Jupanakax wali sumaw uka tuqitxa.
As it always is.	Kunjamtï nayrajj ukhamäki ukhama.
The old man was a bad guy.	Uka jilïr jaqejj jan wali jaqënwa.
But one day he said it very firmly.	Ukampis mä urux wali chʼamampiw säna.
And that is unbearable.	Ukat ukajj janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
The next day was beautiful.	Qhipürux wali sumapunïnwa.
But it's hard not to.	Ukampis jan lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
I started to walk away.	Nayax sarxañ qalltawayta.
I want to reiterate that.	Uka tuqit wasitat arsuñ munta.
Good, such a good day.	Suma, ukhama suma uru.
So I don't want to do any more.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp lurañ munkti.
There’s more power to come.	Ukanx juk’amp ch’amaw jutani.
No, of course not.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa janiwa.
He did well and that was good.	Jupax wali sum luräna ukat ukax wali askiwa.
It’s a cold night.	Mä thaya arumaw.
Have you ever done that.	¿Jumajj kunapachas ukham lurayäta.
I felt very comfortable and very happy.	Nayax wali sumaw jikxatasiyäta ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I wonder who lives there now.	Jichhax khitis ukan jakasi sasaw jiskt’asta.
So good, actually.	Ukhama suma, chiqpachansa.
He had just told her about the crime.	Jupajj jichhakiw uka jan wali luratapat yatiyäna.
Instead, he talked about how he died.	Jan ukasti, kunjamsa jupajj jiwjjäna uka toqet parläna.
So he got one.	Ukhamajj jupajj mä katoqäna.
It’s all you can do.	Ukax taqi kunatix lurañjamäki ukawa.
He’s always been like that.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham jikxatasïna.
That’s what he appreciated.	Ukaw wali askit uñjäna.
How the time is going.	Kunjamsa pachax saraski.
There’s money to be made.	Kuna qullqis lurañax utji.
And he obviously decided to tell me.	Ukat qhanaw nayar yatiyañ amtäna.
He told the whole truth.	Jupajj taqe kunatï cheqäki uk sänwa.
Now for that.	Jichhax ukatakix.
I’m the first to admit it.	Nayax nayrïr iyaw sañ munta.
No one knew what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
Worse and worse and worse.	Juk’amp jan wali ukat juk’amp jan wali ukat juk’amp jan wali.
I promise, it’s good for you.	Nayax arsuwayta, jumatakix wali askiwa.
This is all good for you.	Akax taqpach jumatakix wali askiwa.
I feel the same way.	Nayax ukhamarakiw jikxatastxa.
He’ll be home tomorrow, probably around noon.	Jupax qharüruw utar purini, inas niya chika uru purini.
It’s a great little guy.	Mä jach’a jisk’a jaqiwa.
He didn't understand why he had to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
I rarely find them.	Jupanakajj jukʼakiw jikjjatasta.
He had no idea what was wrong.	Jupajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna uk janiw amuykänti.
But that is how it goes.	Ukampis ukajj kunjamsa saraski ukawa.
There was plenty of light here.	Aka chiqanx walja qhanaw utjäna.
It worked for me today.	Jichhürunakanxa nayatakix wali askiwa.
I'm not sure why?.	Nayax kunatsa?.
There’s no one quite like you.	Janiw khitis jumar uñtasit chiqpachapunix utjkiti.
Maybe it’s enough for you.	Inas jumatakix wakischispa.
He’s done well this season.	Jupax aka pachanx wali sum lurawayi.
So what is it! 	Ukhamajj ¡kunsa!
What he really wanted.	Kuntï jupajj cheqpachapun munkäna ukawa.
He seemed to be in a happy mood.	Jupajj kusisit chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
He was asleep that night.	Jupajj uka arumaw ikiskäna.
He is the most amazing person.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp muspharkañ jaqewa.
I've seen it done before.	Nayrajj ukham lurir uñjta.
But he walked alone.	Ukampis mä sapakiw sarnaqäna.
I don’t have anyone right now.	Jichhax janiw khitis utjkituti.
Definitely that kind of day.	Chiqpachansa uka kasta uru.
Well, that's not the case for me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayatakejj ukhamäkiti.
And he’s a snowflake.	Ukat jupax ch’uqi satawa.
That’s because .	Ukax kunatix .
He made the money.	Uka qullqi luratayna.
So what's here doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj kunatï akan utjki ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
The good guy is the little guy.	Suma jaqejj jiskʼa jaqewa.
I think about leaving.	Nayax sarxañ tuqit amuyta.
I don’t remember, or I don’t remember.	Janiw amtaskti, jan ukax janiw amtaskti.
He did it with great pleasure.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uk luräna.
Like he was planning something.	Kunjamtï jupax kuns amtkäna ukhama.
But it took hours.	Ukampis walja horanakaw munasïna.
He expected something else.	Jupajj yaqha toqetwa suyäna.
Or at least not for me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Crime was something else.	Jan wali lurañajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
But somehow, they often manage to get the job done.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, jupanakax walja kutiw uka irnaqäw lurañ yatipxi.
I don't know what to do with myself.	Janiw naya pachpajj kun lurañsa yatkti.
That's how he knew it.	Ukhamwa ukham yatïna.
He was left alone.	Jupa sapakiw qheparäna.
What you told me.	Kuntix jumax nayar sista.
And it’s not like that at all.	Ukat janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
No reason, nothing at all.	Janiw kunatsa, janiw kunas utjkiti.
He didn't understand anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa amuykänti.
But you can do it on your own, on your own.	Ukampis juma pachpaw uk lurasma, juma pachpaw uk lurasma.
that’s the way it is.	ukax ukhamawa.
He really wanted to know.	Chiqpachansa yatiñ munäna.
I need a letter from you.	Nayajj jumanakat mä carta munta.
Anything and everything.	Kunas ukat taqi kunas.
But he was a real nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj cheqpach suma jaqënwa.
He rarely went there.	Jupajj jukʼakiw uka cheqar saräna.
He was absolutely, amazingly right.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw, muspharkañ chiqaw säna.
He’s a good guy, he always is.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, jupax sapa kutiw ukhama.
But it still clearly does.	Ukampis wali qhanaw uk luraski.
I am not available today.	Jichhürojj janiw nayajj utjkiti.
I don’t have the money.	Nayax janiw uka qullqix utjkituti.
We are not as .	Jiwasax janiw kunjamtï .
That is not the most useful.	Ukajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
And he immediately looked around.	Ukat jankʼakiw uñchʼukiskäna.
But it is a joy to do these things.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj wali kusiskañawa.
This one did both.	Aka maynix panpachaniw luräna.
For a time he was.	Mä tiempow jupajj utjäna.
I never did, you know.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, jumax yatisktawa.
That was about a year later.	Ukajj niya mä mara qhepatwa pasäna.
He started drinking more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw umañ qalltäna.
I feel like that's what works for me.	Ukajj nayatak askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
Something's wrong there.	Kunas ukan jan walïki.
I like that better.	Nayatakix ukax juk’amp askiwa.
Both are bad, of course.	Panpachaniw jan wali, chiqansa.
But the boy was doing well.	Ukampis uka waynax wali sum sarnaqäna.
But this time I saw nothing.	Ukampis aka kutin janiw kuns uñjkti.
But he isn't right.	Ukampis jupajj janiw walïkiti.
He takes good care of you.	Jupaw jumanakat sum uñji.
We will have to do what we can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañaw wakisini.
The two words.	Uka pä aru.
It ended really well.	Chiqpachansa, ukax wali amuyumpiw tukuyäna.
And he was watching.	Ukat jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.
And these people .	Ukat uka jaqinakax .
He was in a depressed mood in the afternoon.	Jupajj tardejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
It seemed strange and foreign.	Ukajj wali muspharkañ ukat yaqha markankir jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
All of these things need to be done .	Taqi ukanak lurañaw wakisi .
He never said exactly why.	Jupajj janipuniw kunatsa uk sum siskänti.
Interestingly, he chooses not to do so.	Ukampis wali muspharkañawa, jupax janiw ukham lurañ amti.
I did nothing to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw kuns lurkti.
And it was nowhere to be found.	Ukat janiw kawkhansa ukajj utjkänti.
In fact, that’s exactly what you need to do.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw jumax lurañama.
No, not this time.	Janiwa, janiw aka kutix utjkiti.
But nothing about it before.	Ukampis janiw kunas nayrajj uka toqet utjkänti.
The morning is already hot and humid.	Alwax niyaw junt’u ukat thaya.
I guess there’s no secret here.	Nayax amuyta, janiw akanx jamasat utjkiti.
He sees it as something he wants to do.	Jupajj ukajj kuntï lurañ munkaspa ukhamwa uñji.
I decided to get the book.	Nayax uka libro apsuñ amtawayta.
I have not had a single problem.	Janiw mä jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
There’s no reason for you.	Janiw kuna razonas jumatakix utjkiti.
I think visually.	Nayax uñjañ tuqit amuyta.
He always does the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk sapa kutiw luraski.
Or someone else worked.	Jan ukajj mayniw irnaqäna.
I’ve seen it better.	Nayax juk’amp sum uñjta.
That doesn’t work yet.	Ukax janiw jichhakamax irnaqkiti.
There’s a little bit of everything here.	Aka chiqanx mä juk’a taqi kunaw utji.
I couldn't have done better.	Janiw jukʼamp sum lurirjamäkti.
Monday is a tough one.	Lunes urux wali ch’amawa.
But that's all he does.	Ukampis ukakiw jupajj luri.
He phoned in desperation.	Jupax wali llakitaw telefonot jawsäna.
I’m hungry for it.	Nayax ukatakix manq’at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
It’s a little bit of a snowflake.	Ukax mä jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
There is no time like this.	Ukham pachax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
Everything you do is transparent.	Taqi kunatix lurapkta ukax qhanawa.
I'm not saying yes.	Janiw nayajj jïsa siskti.
He sees it.	Jupajj uk uñji.
I’m definitely not.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jan ukhamäkti.
And there you have yourself.	Ukat ukanx juma pachpaw jikxatasïta.
The guy had done some film work before.	Uka waynax nayrax mä juk’a película lurañanak luratayna.
But I'm not sure what the problem is.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk janiw sum yatkti.
Nothing here for you.	Janiw kunas akan jumatakix utjkiti.
He wanted to do everything.	Taqi kun lurañ munäna.
But it will have to be done for now.	Ukampis jichhakamax lurañaw wakisini.
It rides better.	Ukax juk’amp sumaw kayuk sarxi.
It’s just like this once.	Ukhama mä kutikiw ukhama.
He had never wanted one before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj mä jukʼa munkänti.
I was nothing and no one but you.	Nayajj janiw kunas utjkänti ni khitis jumat sipansa.
I said yes to that.	Nayax uka tuqitxa jïsa sasaw sista.
We all need to do that.	Taqeniw uk lurañasa.
He said he felt good this morning.	Jupax jichha alwax wali sumaw jikxatasi sasaw säna.

Yes, he was very sincere.	Jïsa, jupajj wali taqe chuymaw sarnaqäna.

Of course, we had to.	Chiqansa, jiwasax ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
I think it will last that long.	Nayax amuyta, ukax ukham jaya pachaw utjani.
Also chop the snowflakes.	Ukhamaraki ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
First thing in the morning.	Nayrïr kunaw alwax utji.

Everything seems possible now.	Jichhax taqi kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.

A day later .	Mä uru qhepatjja .
He loved both of them.	Jupajj panpachaniw wal munasïna.
I didn’t want to talk to him.	Janiw jupamp parlañ munkayätti.
And not before you go there.	Ukat janïr uka cheqar sarkasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He looks unusual.	Jupax jan uñt’at uñnaqaniwa.
Maybe it’s enough for me.	Inas nayatakix wakischispa.
Or what he wanted.	Jan ukajj kuntï munkäna uk.
But there’s nothing for it.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukatakix utjkiti.
Always do it twice.	Sapa kutiw pä kuti lurañama.
I took you out.	Nayajj jumanakar apsüna.
Well you know what happened.	Suma jumax yatisktawa kunas pasäna.
There’s something happening.	Ukanx kunas pasaski.
But there are one or two drawbacks.	Ukampis mä jan ukajj pä jan waliw utji.
Now that’s funny.	Jichhax ukax wali muspharkañawa.
He was in love with you.	Jupajj jumamp wal munasïna.

The money comes almost immediately.	Qullqix niya jank’akiw puri.

Don't let that person control you.	Uka jaqejj janiw jumar apnaqañapatak jaytañamäkiti.

So why was he doing this.	Ukhamajj kunatsa ukham luraskäna.
Overall, they’re awesome.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupanakax wali muspharkañawa.

No amount of money is worth it.	Janiw kuna qullqis ukham askïkiti.

He will do it more often.	Jupajj jukʼampiw ukham lurani.

And it’s not available in every country.	Ukat janiw sapa markan utjkiti.

He stayed there for about two weeks.	Jupajj niya pä semanaw ukan qheparäna.

He decided to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañwa amtäna.
He didn’t know how to drive at all.	Jupax janiw kunjamatsa auto apnaqañ yatkänti.
I almost never do that.	Niya janipuniw ukham lurkti.

He wanted to see her for himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupar uñjañ munäna.
I would love to do that.	Ukham lurañajj walpun munta.
It worked the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw irnaqäna.
People are not like that.	Jaqenakajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That's what he said to her.	Ukham sasaw jupar säna.
He was genuinely surprised.	Jupajj cheqapuniw muspharäna.
It was beautiful at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, wali sumapunïnwa.
You think it’s him.	Jumax jupaw ukham amuyta.
For me, that’s what it comes down to.	Nayatakix ukax ukaruw puri.
I don’t want to do that tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw uk lurañ munkti.
Maybe one day you’ll make something out of it.	Inas mä urux ukat kuns lurasma.
But things moved quickly.	Ukampis kunanakas jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
I listened to him carefully.	Jupar sum istʼta.
It can never be repeated.	Janipuniw wasitat lurañjamäkiti.
So it went there.	Ukhamaw ukan saräna.
I don’t have time for that.	Nayax janiw ukatakix tiemponïkti.
That’s all you need.	Ukakiw jumatakix wakisi.
Nothing isn’t like that.	Janiw kunas jan ukhamäkiti.
I’m more concerned.	Nayax juk’amp llakitaw jikxatastxa.
I will never go there again.	Janipuniw mayampsa ukar sarkäti.
But people like him are important.	Ukampis jupar uñtasit jaqenakajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But let’s see how it works.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
Or rather better.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp suma sañ muni.
I think there was a place there.	Nayax amuyta, uka chiqanx mä chiqaw utjäna.
Now tell me something else.	Jichhax yaqha tuqit yatiyapxita.
He seems to not be able to rush things.	Jupax kunjamtï jan kuns jankʼak lurañjamäkiti.
In that respect this is strange.	Uka tuqitxa akax muspharkañawa.
I already feel that way.	Nayax niyaw ukham amuyasta.
So it started there.	Ukhamaw ukan qalltäna.
Don’t forget what you already know.	Kuntï nayratpach yatkayäta uk jan armasimti.
There is only one .	Ukax mä sapakiw .
He said he built a school.	Jupax mä yatiqañ uta lurawayta sasaw säna.
It loves you so much.	Ukax jumarux walpun munasi.
Now it’s time to make a decision.	Jichhax mä amtar puriñ pachaw purini.
He immediately threw it away.	Jupajj jankʼakiw ukar jaqontäna.
Someone is making a film.	Maynix mä película luraski.
I gave him permission.	Nayaw jupar permiso churta.
He got out of the car.	Jupajj autot sarjjäna.
We’ll take care of this.	Jiwasax aka tuqitx uñjañäni.
Make your own rules.	Juman kamachinak luram.
I went there recently, and I’ve been there a lot before.	Jichhakiw ukar sarawayta, ukat nayrax walpun sarawayta.
Therefore the .	Ukatwa uka .
But there are never many people.	Ukampis janipuniw walja jaqenakajj utjkiti.
But really, both ways.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, panpachaniw ukham lurañapa.
It takes about three days.	Niya kimsa uruw munasispa.
I would stay here again.	Nayax wasitat akan qhiparañ munta.
Here’s what you’re saying.	Akax kuntix jumax siskta ukawa.
He knew better, now.	Jupax juk’amp sum yatïna, jichhax.
It lasted two hours.	Ukajj pä horaw utjäna.
That still leaves two.	Ukax wali pä jaytawayi.
I hope to do so myself one day.	Naya pachpaw mä urux ukham lurañ suyaskta.
Yes, but .	Jïsa, ukampis .
Not that long afterwards.	Janiw ukham jaya tiempo qhepatjja.
In doing so, he is doing it to himself.	Ukham lurasajj jupa pachpaw uk luraski.
I started a new life.	Nayax machaq jakañ qalltawayta.
I never got a thing .	Janipuniw mä kuns jikxatkti .
But yeah, he was.	Ukampis jïsa, jupajj ukhamänwa.
So he moved to another place.	Ukatwa yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.
After that, he can take care of himself.	Uka qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw sum uñjasispa.
But you need to do it more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw uk lurañama.
He had already told her.	Nayratpachaw jupar yatiyäna.
There wasn’t any of it.	Janiw kunas ukax utjkänti.
But that will be limited.	Ukampis ukajj mä jukʼakiw utjani.
Almost, but not quite.	Niya, ukampis janiw taqpach.
There is .	Utji .
Both cost money.	Panpachaniw qullqix munasispa.
Really .	Chiqpachansa .
She was terrified of what was coming next.	Kunatï jutïrin paskäna uk uñjasajj wal ajjsaräna.
Well, at least not.	Ukhama, mä juk’a pachax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Well then that happened.	Suma ukat ukax pasäna.
He went on his own anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa jupa pachpaw saräna.
All day, all day.	Taqi uru, taqi uru.
I don’t want to repeat it here.	Janiw nayax akan wasitat arsuñ munkti.
Also, it’s better not to do it.	Ukhamaraki, jan lurañax juk’amp askiwa.
Or maybe he wanted to.	Jan ukajj inas jupajj ukham lurañ munpachäna.
Seeing this, he left her alone.	Uk uñjasajj sapak jaytawayi.
He refused to give it to her.	Jupajj janiw jupar churañ munkänti.
Also located in a good location.	Ukhamaraki mä suma chiqan jikxatasi.
And also this doesn’t last long.	Ukat ukhamaraki akax janiw jaya pachax utjkiti.
Would be nice on a cold day!.	¡Mä thaya urux wali askïspawa!.
That can happen later.	Ukajj qhepatwa pasaspa.
I don't know why.	Janiw kunatsa ukanak yatkti.
One is rarely available.	Maynix juk’akiw utji.
I have so much of him.	Nayajj jupat walpun utjitu.
But there was one.	Ukampis maynix ukhamänwa.
I, of course, understand.	Nayax, chiqpachapuniw, amuyasta.
That will take some time.	Ukajj mä jukʼa tiempow munasini.
A fool, perhaps.	Mä loqhe, inas.
In doing so.	Ukham lurasajj.
He stared at them for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
But he knows what's wrong.	Ukampis kunas jan walïki uk sum yati.
The future never matters.	Jutïr tiempojj janipuniw kunäkisa.
But it was .	Ukampis ukhamänwa .
The boy was in a state of shock.	Uka waynax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
It worked a few times.	Ukajj mä qhawqha kutiw irnaqäna.
He’s really a nice guy.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He didn't know how to talk to her.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa jupamp parltʼañ yatkänti.
he said again.	sasaw wasitat säna.
He had no idea how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
It takes time to do these things.	Ukanak lurañatakix tiempow munasispa.
We are also .	Jiwasax ukhamarakiw .
It’s very very unpopular.	Wali wali jan wali uñt’atawa.
He wanted to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa lurañ munäna.
This can be seen many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw uñjasispa.
You can do a lot more.	Jukʼamp walja lurañanak lurasma.
There is no need to do so, which is good.	Ukham lurañajj janiw wakiskiti, ukajj wali askiwa.
But it is necessary to make the present time.	Ukampis jichha tiempon utjki uka tiempo lurañatakiw wakisi.
And that seems to be a good thing.	Ukat ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
Thank you very much, above all.	Walpun yuspärta, taqi kunat sipansa.
I don't see how it could last longer.	Kunjamsa jukʼamp tiempojj utjaspa uk janiw uñjkti.
He came quietly and left sadly.	Jupax amukiw jutäna ukat llakitaw sarxäna.
There’s nothing more to do tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw kunas juk’amp lurañax utjkiti.
I don’t know yet.	Nayax janiw jichhakamax yatkti.
You have to do all of these things.	Taqi ukanak lurañamawa.
But, that's worth it.	Ukampis, ukajj wali askiwa.
No one here is on it.	Janiw khitis akanx uka tuqitx utjkiti.
That means at the same time.	Ukax pachpa pachan sañ muni.
He was almost	Jupajj niya .
This looks really, really cool.	Akax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali suma uñtatawa.
There is more to it than that.	Ukajj jukʼampiw utji.
He saw it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk uñjäna.
I didn't know any better than that.	Nayajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp yatkayätti.
So he decided a while ago.	Ukatwa mä jukʼa tiempo nayrajj uk amtäna.
The food he made.	Uka manq’a jupax luratayna.
Or anything about him.	Jan ukajj jupat kuna.
I’m a heavy drinker.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw umañ yatta.
No one knows much about him.	Janiw khitis jupat wal yatkiti.
It all looks great, but something didn’t quite feel right.	Taqi ukanakax wali sumaw uñtasi, ukampis kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
A night or two ago.	Mä arumax jan ukax pä arumaw nayrax.
He refused, so he left.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, ukatwa sarjjäna.
But it doesn’t work here.	Ukampis akanx janiw irnaqkiti.
Maybe even a room.	Inas mä cuarto ukham lurañax wakischispa.
We will be happy to do so.	Wali kusisitaw uk lurañäni.
Of course, it doesn't work that way.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
I really can't stand it anymore.	Chiqpachansa janiw jukʼamp aguantañjamäkiti.
Like you don’t care.	Kunjamtï jumax jan kuns lurkta ukhama.
He hadn't for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan ukhamäkänti.
I couldn’t afford it any other way.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa qullqix utjkitänti.
But he was doing it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham luraskäna.
Make sure it’s available.	Ukhama ukaxa utjki ukhama.
I asked him again.	Nayajj wasitatwa jupar jisktʼta.
This is exciting right now.	Akax jichhax wali kusiskañawa.
As time went on.	Kunjamtï tiempojj paskäna ukhama.
And then the moment comes to me.	Ukat uka pachax nayaruw purini.
It felt cool and comfortable.	Ukajj wali thaya ukat sumaw jikjjatasïna.
There was something here.	Aka chiqanx kunas utjäna.
Or at least knows that sort of thing.	Jan ukax mä juk’a yatiw uka kasta.
More important to this.	Ukarux juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
That something happened to you.	Uka kunas jumatakix pasäna.
Every day someone gets hurt.	Sapa uruw maynix jan walin uñjasi.
No one wants to play with me.	Janiw khitis nayamp anattʼañ munkiti.
He didn't want to get too hard on it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit sinti chʼam tukuñ munkänti.
The reality is that no one knows for sure.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw khitis sum yatkiti.

Very small but very nice.	Wali jisk’a ukampis wali sumawa.

He could do everything right.	Taqi kuns sum luraspäna.

So he threw me.	Ukatwa jupajj nayar jaqontäna.
It’s now midday.	Jichhax chika uruw purini.
Many times many.	Walja kutiw walja.
It really shook me up.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw ch’allxtayäna.
He did this several times.	Ukjja walja kutiw luräna.
Here you want to say something.	Aka chiqanx jumax kuns sañ munta.

He was always interested in baseball.	Jupax béisbol ukarux sapa kutiw chuym churäna.
But he didn't know what was going to happen now.	Ukampis kunas jichhajj pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
Yes, he didn't want to deny anything.	Jïsa, janiw kunsa jan iyaw sañ munkänti.
In doing so, the	Ukham lurasajj .
What a man truly is is what he has.	Kunatï mä jaqejj cheqpachapun utjki ukajja, kunatï jupan utjki ukawa.
He wondered where the question should go.	Uka jisktʼajj kawkirus sarañapa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But now it is.	Ukampis jichhajj ukhamawa.
I have known this for years.	Nayajj walja maranakaw uk yatta.
It was either very good.	Ukajj jan ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
You never want to do anything again.	Janipuniw mayamps kuns lurañ munktati.
In this case, no one is.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.
There is no such thing now.	Jichhax janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
That was the best feeling.	Ukaw wali sum jikjjatasïna.
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tonight.	Qharüru, qharüru, aka arumax.
He loves it here.	Jupax aka chiqanx walpun munasi.
He was excited, you know.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, uk yatisktawa.
I don’t want to pay another fee.	Nayax janiw yaqha qullqi churañ munkti.
I think he’s better that way.	Nayax amuyta, jupax ukham juk’amp askiwa.
They don’t know when.	Jupanakax kunapachas uk janiw yatipkiti.
I want to know how to do this.	Kunjamsa ukanak lurañax uk yatiñ munta.
Now was not the time.	Jichhajj janiw uka tiempojj utjkänti.
But there doesn't seem to be any problem there.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis ukan utjkaspati.
It’s a little cold.	Mä juk’a thaya.
I don't do that myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham lurkti.
Why, that’s obvious.	Kunatsa, ukax qhanawa.
He tells her to do as she says.	Kunjamtï siski ukhamarjam luram sasaw säna.

And indeed, he was.	Ukat chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamänwa.
In this respect, we are the best.	Uka tuqitxa, jiwasax wali askiwa.
He’s not going for me.	Jupax janiw nayatakix sarkiti.
But I wasn't surprised.	Ukampis janiw ukajj wal muspharkayätti.
Things are really interesting now.	Chiqpachansa kunanakas jichhax wali askiwa.
In fact, it was just one.	Chiqansa, mä sapakiw ukhamänwa.
He doesn't need that right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukajj munaskiti.
And later, he didn't.	Ukat qhepatjja, janiw ukham lurkänti.
But I have done it.	Ukampis nayajj uk lurawayta.
Let me know if you want it.	Munasmati uk yatiyapxita.
That’s very familiar to me.	Ukax nayatakix wali uñt’atawa.
That is not the case now.	Jichhajj janiw ukajj ukhamäkiti.

He is an excellent pianist.	Jupajj wali sumaw piano tocañ yati.

And every summer he feels like this.	Ukat sapa verano jupax ukham jikxatasi.
Not when the other was looking.	Janiw maynix uñchʼukiskäna ukhaxa.
Try not to do that too much.	Ukham jan sinti lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
I didn't realize it immediately.	Janiw uk jankʼak amuykayätti.
This wasn’t always the case.	Ukax janiw sapa kutix utjkänti.

And he knew what that felt like.	Ukat kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.

He says he appreciates something.	Kunas wali askit uñji sasaw saraki.

But there is no money.	Ukampis janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
That’s because it’s awesome.	Ukax kunatix wali muspharkañawa.
It’s a great way to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix wali askiwa.
I want to say the wrong thing again.	Nayax wasitat jan wali arsuñ munta.
Unless yours truly means something.	Jan ukasti jumanakan chiqpachapuniw kuns sañ muni.
In this case, the same is true.	Uka tuqitxa, pachpa chiqaw utji.
But for some reason he felt that way.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham amuyasïna.
I wasn’t expecting to see you.	Janiw jumar uñjañ suykayätti.

You’re still in the spotlight.	Jumax wali uñt’atawa.

He left her at home.	Jupax utapan jaytawayi.

One more day, but no more.	Mä urux juk’ampi, ukampis janiw juk’ampi.

After all, it comes down to what makes you feel good.	Taqi kunat sipansa, kunas sum jikxatasïta ukaruw puri.

He got it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak katoqäna.
Right there in the morning.	Uka chiqan alwax.
I haven’t gone yet.	Nayax janiw jichhakamax sarkti.
When they don’t .	Kunapachatï jupanakax jan .
That seemed so alien to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He was obviously moved.	Jupajj qhanaw chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
He was happy about it.	Jupax ukat kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Now, just tell me.	Jichhax, ukhamakiw yatiyapxita.
Just tell him this, you understand.	Juparux akax ukhamakiw yatiyañama, jumax amuyasta.
Nothing could do that.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañ puedkänti.
That's why he knows everything.	Ukatwa jupajj taqe kun yati.

He said so himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham arsüna.
But, it doesn’t really work.	Ukampis, janiw chiqpachansa irnaqkiti.
Things started going fast.	Kunatï paskäna ukajj jankʼakiw sarañ qalltäna.
Now that can last for hours.	Jichhax ukax walja horanakaw utjaspa.
He seemed kind enough.	Jupajj suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.

That’s all you had.	Ukakiw jumatakix utjäna.
Or how he felt about her, for that matter.	Jan ukajj kunjamsa jupat amuyasïna, ukatakejj.

Therefore, he moved to the country.	Ukatwa uka markar sarjjäna.
A little bit like that.	Mä juk’a ukhama.
I readily agreed to do it.	Uk lurañatakejj jankʼakiw iyaw sista.
He kept it tight.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw uñjäna.
He knew that this did not matter.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa uk jupajj sum yatïna.

He doesn’t need to.	Jupax janiw wakiskiti.

He seemed like a nice guy.	Jupajj mä suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

But he stayed too long.	Ukampis jupajj wali jaya tiempow qheparäna.
I will definitely have to do another room.	Chiqpachansa yaqha cuarto lurañaw wakisini.
I went to university here.	Nayax akan jach’a yatiqañ utar sarawayta.
How long ago and far away it all seemed.	Qhawqha pachas nayra ukat jaya taqe kunas amuyasïna.

He knew the word immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka aru yatïna.
I don’t know how to make coffee.	Janiw café lurañ yatkti.
Of course he didn't say anything.	Chiqansa janiw kuns arskänti.
Above all, I am very happy.	Taqi kunat sipansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.

But I didn’t see him today.	Ukampis jichhürunakan janiw jupar uñjkti.
It was all he was doing.	Ukajj jupa sapakiw luraskäna.
Obviously he doesn’t want to talk to us.	Qhanaw jupax janiw jiwasamp parlañ munkiti.
Which is a great time.	Kuna jach’a pachas.
But now I feel better.	Ukampis jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
That's what he said.	Ukhamajj sasaw jupajj säna.
It happened in the past and it can happen again.	Nayra tiempon pasäna ukat wasitatwa pasaspa.
Later he was disappointed.	Qhipharux jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I didn’t expect this at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk suykayätti.
She said that she didn't like it.	Ukajj janiw nayatak askïkiti sasaw jupajj säna.
What he has to do.	Kunsa jupajj lurañapa.
It’s better for it.	Ukatakix juk’amp askiwa.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Jupajj nayat taqe kun yatiñwa munäna.
I never told him that.	Janipuniw ukham jupar siskti.
He loved to drive.	Jupajj auto apnaqañ wal munäna.
I’m still definitely doing that.	Nayax wali chiqpachapuniw ukham luraskta.
He had not spoken for some time.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jan arskänti.
Or at least a little bit of time.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa tiempo.
Now he 's .	Jichhajj jupajj .
Nothing special about it.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa wali askïkiti.
There was something he said.	Ukanjja, kunaw jupajj säna.
I came to see you today.	Jichhüruw jumanakar uñjir jutta.
He did no more than that.	Jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp lurkänti.
He always was.	Jupajj nayratpach ukhamänwa.
I really doubt it.	Chiqpachansa pächastwa.
He wanted her back.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar munäna.
Not every man can have that.	Janiw sapa chachax ukham utjkaspati.
So it was now or never.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
Now there is no reason.	Jichhax janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
But the reason lies elsewhere.	Ukampis kunatsa ukajj yaqha cheqan jikjjatasi.

It’s still in a bad mood.	Wali jan walin uñjasi.
But no, not really.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw cheqpachapun ukhamäkänti.
I know a piece of meat.	Nayax mä aycha ch’uqi yatta.
He failed earlier and improved later.	Jupajj nayraw jan sum lurkänti ukat qhepatjja, jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
I really don’t remember much about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit wal amtaskti.
It was nice, but not enough.	Wali sumapunïnwa, ukampis janiw ukajj utjkänti.
He died about two years ago.	Jupajj niya pä mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
I asked him why he wouldn't.	Kunatsa jan munkaspa uk jisktʼta.
I just realized something.	Jichhakiw mä kuns amuyayäta.
I think that's the best way to do it.	Ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askïspa sasaw amuyta.
No one needs to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’s there to do the wrong thing.	Jupax jan walinak lurañatakiw ukan jikxatasi.
And people don’t know that.	Ukat jaqinakax janiw uk yatipkiti.
I can see that going really well.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali sum saraski uk uñjta.
In this case, there is nothing.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw kunas utjkiti.
He didn't understand why he felt that way.	Kunatsa ukham jikjjatasïna uk janiw amuykänti.
He was about the same size and height.	Jupajj niya pachpa jachʼa ukat pachpa jachʼa jaqënwa.
And it looks great.	Ukat wali sumaw uñtasi.
This is a good way to do that.	Ukajj ukham lurañatakejj wali askiwa.
That was it for that.	Ukatakejj ukhamänwa.
He was very sad and worried.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna ukat llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Really excited about this.	Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw aka tuqitxa.

And he decided not to do anything wrong.	Ukat jan jan walinak lurañwa amtäna.
You said that once.	Jumax mä kutix ukham sista.

Someone sees this all the time.	Maynix sapa kutiw uk uñji.
He’s got somewhere.	Jupax kawkhans jikxatasïna.
When you say one thing but mean another.	Kunapachatï mä arunak siskta ukampis yaqha arunak sañ munkta ukhajja.
Someone else will do it.	Mayniw uk lurani.
No one knows what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
It was a quarter of an hour.	Mä cuarto horaw utjäna.
He obviously knows.	Jupax qhanaw yati.
He is a high school student.	Jupax jach’a yatiqañ utan yatiqiriwa.
Or a rock, for that matter.	Jan ukax mä qala, uka tuqitxa.
He can’t do it over the phone, and he can’t do it now.	Jupax janiw telefonot lurañjamäkiti, jichhax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
But you know something strange.	Ukampis jumax mä muspharkañ yatta.
Good air, he said.	Suma thaya, sasaw säna.
Of course, we have more than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa jukʼampiw utjistu.
It could be done over the phone.	Ukajj telefonot luraspänwa.
I made them myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak lurañatak lurayäta.
Here’s what you need to do.	Akax kuna lurañas wakisispa.
He refused to admit it, but finally agreed.	Jupajj janiw uk iyaw sañ munkänti, ukampis qhepatjja iyaw sänwa.
It doesn’t work well at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw sum irnaqkiti.
A lovely day!.	¡Mä munat uru!.
But I don't like that very much.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatak wali askïkiti.
How I feel is the best thing I can do.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta ukajj taqe kunat sipansa walikïskiwa.
So you have to do it right.	Ukhamajj sum lurañamawa.
But the truth is, he doesn't know that.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajja, janiw uk yatkiti.
Now that’s unusual.	Jichhax ukax jan uñt’atawa.
That’s what the new year looks like.	Ukhamaw machaq marax uñtasi.
And he’s fine with it.	Ukat jupax walikïskiwa.

I think that’s what I’m going to do.	Nayax ukham lurañaw sasaw amuyta.
There is nothing real about the film.	Película tuqitxa janiw kunas chiqpach utjkiti.
He worked very hard.	Wali chʼamampiw irnaqäna.

Here’s what we did.	Akax kuntix lurapkta ukawa.

He certainly has it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham utji.
You need to do this at least twice.	Pä kutis ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I feel very uncomfortable.	Nayajj wali jan sum jikjjatasta.
This is not a good thing to do.	Ukax janiw sum lurañjamäkiti.
But that's not good enough for you.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jumatakejj walïkiti.
Everything moved so fast.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw sarnaqäna.
He talked about you.	Jupajj jumat parläna.
A big, cold, flat rock.	Mä jach’a, thaya, ch’uqi qala.

For me, that says it all.	Nayatakix ukax taqpach arsu.

He thought it would be no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw amuyäna.
There is nothing here .	Janiw kunas akanx utjkiti .
That's not going to happen.	Ukajj janiw lurkaspati.
Red, red, red.	Wila, wila, wila.
But he couldn’t, not at all.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti, janiw kunjamatsa.
And not now, all the time.	Ukat janiw jichhax, taqi pachan.
It did very well .	Ukajj wali sumwa luräna .
He is definitely going for it!.	¡Jupax chiqpachansa ukaruw saraski!.
I would like to suggest it myself.	Naya pachpaw uka tuqit amuytʼayañ munta.
That's how long it takes.	Ukajj qawqha tiempos munasispa.
He came to me wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw nayar jutäna.
That’s the first thing he needs to do.	Ukaw nayraqat lurañapa.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Nayax janiw aka chiqat kawkirus sarañax uk yatkti.
I didn't tell him.	Janiw nayajj jupar siskti.
That was how he felt about it.	Ukhamaw jupajj uka toqet amuyäna.
And he saw it.	Ukat uk uñjäna.

I saw an opportunity.	Mä oportunidad uñjta.
It’s time to move.	Ukax sarnaqañ pachaw purini.
But they don't talk on the phone.	Ukampis janiw telefonot parlañ yatipkiti.
One person refused to play.	Mä jaqix janiw anattʼañ munkänti.

That’s the only thing that would be good.	Ukakiw wali askïspa.

But one day it became very clear to me.	Ukampis mä urux nayatakix wali qhanaw uñjasi.
I am doing better.	Nayajj jukʼamp sum luraskta.
I never did anything.	Janipuniw kuns lurkti.
But there is nothing for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw kunas utjkiti.
He already knew it.	Jupajj niyaw sum yatïna.
So he went with her to the last bed.	Ukatwa qhep qhepa ikiñar sarañatak jupamp chik saräna.
Instead, tell everyone about it.	Jan ukasti taqiniruw uka tuqit yatiyañama.
I know it’s hard.	Nayax yattwa, ukax ch’amawa.
He just keeps going.	Jupax ukhamakiw sarnaqaski.
But he’s quiet in class.	Ukampis jupax clasen amukiw jikxatasi.
And then he started talking.	Ukat ukat parltʼañ qalltäna.
But it really is, really .	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukhamawa, chiqpachansa .
It ended very sensibly.	Ukajj wali amuyumpiw tukuyäna.
No, after all, he was right about her.	Janiwa, taqe kunat sipansa, jupajj cheqapuniw jupat parläna.
I don't want to live without you.	Janiw nayajj jan jumamp jakañ munkti.

He stared at her for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa pachaw uñchʼukiskäna.
No one expected this.	Janiw khitis uk suykayätti.
But this doesn’t matter.	Ukampis akax janiw kunas wakiskiti.

Honestly, you don’t need anything.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas munaskiti.

Or week ago.	Jan ukax semana nayra.
No, actually, tomorrow is the day.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa, qharüruw uka urux utjani.
There is no truth in this matter.	Aka tuqitxa janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
It doesn't matter now, anyhow.	Jichhajj janiw kunäkisa, kunjamatsa.
He told them he couldn’t do it.	Janiw lurirjamäkti sasaw jupanakar säna.
And do it twice.	Ukat pä kuti lurañamawa.

But he didn't want to talk about it now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
In fact, it never is.	Chiqpachansa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He wants everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kun muni.
I tried my best to keep everything to a minimum.	Taqe kunsa jan sinti lurañatakejj wal chʼamachasiyäta.
It’s weird to me, but it’s a lot of fun.	Nayatakix wali muspharkañawa, ukampis wali kusiskañawa.

So he got one himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa mä apsüna.

Tell us what you love to do the most.	Kun lurañsa jumajj jukʼamp munta uk yatiyapjjeta.

He looked at them with some concern.	Jupajj mä jukʼa llakitaw jupanakar uñjäna.
I don’t think it’s worth it.	Nayatakix janiw askïkiti.
There is no time or place.	Janiw kuna horasas ukat kawkhansa utji.

What is the problem?.	¿Kunas jan walïki?.
This must be done immediately.	Ukajj jankʼakiw lurañapa.
He felt stubborn himself.	Jupa pachpaw qala chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
It was a lovely feeling.	Ukajj wali munasiñampiw jikjjatasïna.
I want to be the last to pay this.	Nayax qhip qhipa aka qullqi churañ munta.
He seemed unattractive.	Jupajj jan suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But if you want to talk anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa parlañ munsta ukhaxa.
A bedroom, she thought.	Mä ikiñ uta, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Or not at all.	Jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Just like you and I did.	Kunjamtï jumamp nayampejj lurapkta ukhama.
But no one could manage time.	Ukampis janiw khitis tiempo apnaqañ puedkänti.
Hence, the question arises.	Ukatwa, uka jisktʼajj utji.
Everything but me.	Taqi kunas jan ukasti nayax.
He talked more and more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw parläna.
A cool car.	Mä thaya auto.
You probably ask a lot of questions.	Inas walja jisktʼanak jisktʼasta.
Twice a week is enough for me.	Semanan pä kutiw nayatakejj wakisi.
But it started early.	Ukampis nayratpachaw qalltäna.
But that doesn't matter to him.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jupajj kunäkisa.
It’s very difficult at the moment.	Jichha pachax wali ch’amawa.
That’s all you have to do.	Ukakiw lurañama.
He looks almost naked.	Jupax niya q’ala uñnaqaniwa.
Of course not, there is no such thing.	Chiqansa janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
So where does he live .	Ukhamajj kawkhansa jupajj jakasi .
It's a curious thing.	Ukajj yatiñ muni.
A little of this, a little of that.	Mä juk’a aka, mä juk’a ukat.
More needed to be done.	Jukʼamp lurañatakejj kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
I can’t find the book.	Nayax janiw uka libro jikxatkti.
There was a need to do something.	Kuna lurañas wakisïna.
But I 'm not sure	Ukampis nayajj .
But everything went quiet.	Ukampis taqe kunas amukiw sarjjäna.
He began to walk faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw sarnaqañ qalltäna.
She knew he knew it.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna uk sum yatïna.
This is all good stuff.	Akax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He felt like he couldn't do anything about it.	Jupajj uka toqet jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
I don’t want anything to happen to him.	Janiw kunas jupar pasañap munkti.
He has to do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa ukham lurañapa.
You don't have to go alone.	Janiw sapak sarañajj wakiskiti.
He is relatively quiet and passive.	Jupajj mä jukʼa amukiw ukat janiw kuns lurkiti.
We will see him at home longer.	Juparux jukʼamp tiempow utan uñjañäni.
That meant yes.	Ukajj jïsa sañ munäna.
I ask about it.	Uka toqet jisktʼasta.
But, and this very important.	Ukampis, ukat aka wali wakiskiriwa.
Now, he looked worried.	Jichhax, jupax llakitaw uñnaqäna.
You anytime.	Jumax kuna pachas.
I didn’t have any time.	Janiw kuna pachas utjkitänti.
It’s always found.	Ukax sapa kutiw jikxatasi.
You have to do that somehow.	Jumax kunjamatsa ukham lurañama.
It’s not good here.	Aka chiqanx janiw askïkiti.
I’m doing amazing.	Nayax muspharkañ luraskta.
He lives in a wonderful, rich world.	Jupax mä suma, qamir pachan jakasi.
Now that’s pretty common.	Jichhax ukax wali uñt’atawa.
Can’t do it, of course.	Janiw lurañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
This guy is a nice guy.	Aka jaqix wali suma jaqiwa.
This is the most important part.	Akax juk’amp wakiskir chiqaw sañ muni.
He sees the future with you.	Jupajj jumamp chikaw jutïr urunak uñji.
So someone saw it.	Ukhamajj mayniw uk uñjäna.
They’re all just so good.	Jupanakax taqiniw ukhamakiw wali suma.
Well, it’s very difficult, really.	Ukhama, wali ch’amawa, chiqpachansa.
Or you can do it today.	Jan ukajj jichhürunakan lurasma.
They already know about you.	Jupanakax niyaw jumat yatipxi.
Better yet, this is better.	Juk’amp askiwa, akax juk’amp askiwa.
Any brother that happened.	Kawkïr jilatatï ukham paskäna ukajja.
There is no real way to do this.	Uk lurañatakejj janiw kuna cheqpach lurañas utjkiti.
These are harder to do right.	Ukanakax chiqapar lurañax juk’amp ch’amawa.
Yes, there is nothing.	Jïsa, janiw kunas utjkiti.
He did it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk luräna.
Everyone knows something.	Taqinipuniw kuns yatipxi.
He’s an unusual guy.	Jupax mä jan uñt’at waynawa.
He kind of shook it all up.	Jupax mä juk’a taqi ukanak ch’allxtayäna.
You can do this dozens of times a night.	Ukxa tunka tunka kutiw mä arumax lurasma.
But this still doesn’t matter.	Ukampis akax waliw jan kunäkisa.
But he could have done more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw luraspäna.
I’ve seen it first hand.	Nayax nayraqat uñjta.
Why, he didn’t understand.	Kunatsa, jupax janiw amuyaskänti.
He’ll have it any time now.	Jupax jichhax kuna pachas utjani.
And boy does it look amazing.	Ukat waynax muspharkañ uñtasi.
That's bad, though.	Uka jan wali, ukhama.
You have to do something, or you have to do something.	Jumax kuns lurañamawa, jan ukax kuns lurañamawa.
He didn't say all of that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kuns siskänti.
I really don't understand that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit sum amuykti.
Someone shook him.	Mayniw juparux ch’allxtayäna.
Let’s see what can be seen from this new viewpoint.	Aka machaq uñjañ tuqitxa kunsa uñjasispa uk uñjañäni.
It took a while until then.	Uka pachax jichhakamax mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.
No, he loved her.	Janiwa, juparux walpun munäna.
Next one will be very soon!.	Jutïr maynix wali jank’akiw utjani!.
The location is great, too.	Uka chiqanx wali sumaw jikxatasi, ukhamaraki.
I saw him last night.	Qhipa arumax jupar uñjta.
I was the first to notice.	Nayaw nayraqat amuyayäta.
It's amazing that we have to do it again.	Ukajj wasitatwa lurañasa, ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
It’s an hour more.	Mä horaw juk’ampi.
He says it looks bad.	Jan wali uñtatawa sasaw saraki.
Almost arrived tomorrow.	Niya qharüruw purini.
But somehow it works.	Ukampis kunjamatsa walikïskiwa.
Now I understood the problem.	Jichhajj uka jan waltʼäwejj amuyayäta.
He asked you specifically.	Jupax jumarux chiqpachapuniw mayïna.
Things are happening all the time.	Kunanakas sapa kuti luraski.
I love to do everything.	Nayajj taqe kun lurañwa wal munta.
But he was already gone.	Ukampis jupajj niyaw sarjjäna.
Longer this time.	Aka kutix juk’amp jaya.
No, he said it wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
Make it look more attractive.	Ukajj jukʼamp suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham lurañamawa.
I’m in a bit of a hurry.	Nayax mä juk’a jank’akiw jikxatastxa.
I’ve seen the walk.	Nayax sarnaqañ uñjta.
You’re a man’s person, you know.	Jumax mä chachan jaqiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
He already knew about her but mispronounced her name.	Jupajj niyaw jupat yatïna ukampis sutip jan sum arsüna.
I repeated the process several times.	Uka lurañajj walja kutiw wasitat lurayäta.
I love when he does that.	Jupajj ukham luraski ukhajj walpun munasta.
I know immediately what.	Kunas uk jankʼakiw yatta.
I'm not sure what all that is.	Uka taqe kunas kunas uk janiw sum yatkti.
I would definitely go there again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat ukar sarañ munta.
He’s our best man.	Jupax jiwasan wali suma jaqiwa.
These three are important.	Uka kimsa tuqitxa wali wakiskiriwa.
It hasn’t always been that way.	Janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.
He came here last night.	Jupax qhipa arumaw aka chiqar jutäna.
She immediately squeezed him.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
No one knew what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
He didn't know all that.	Janiw taqe ukanak yatkänti.
There is nothing at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw kunas utjkiti.
But all of this is not good.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj janiw walïkiti.
He sees everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa uñji.
This is where you want to get to.	Akax kawkhantï jumax puriñ munkta ukawa.
I understand what he is going through.	Kuntï jupajj pasaski uk sum amuyta.
I have no intention of doing anything to you.	Nayax janiw jumanakar kuns lurañ amtkti.
He’s done well so far.	Jupax jichhakamax wali sum luratayna.
He did the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk luräna.
Really good though.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa ukampis.
I want to take the snowflakes.	Nayax uka ch’uqi ch’uqi apsuñ munta.
Never existed before.	Janipuniw nayrajj utjkänti.
I think this is okay.	Nayax amuyta akax walikïskiwa.
He feels uncomfortable.	Jupajj jan sum jikjjatasi.
No one else does it all that much.	Janiw khitis ukham taqpach lurkiti.
That told me one thing.	Ukaw mä toqet yatiyäna.
The smaller the better.	Jisk’a juk’ampi sumawa.
I hope to release this very soon.	Nayax akax wali jank’akiw apsuñ suyt’askta.
He saw this book here.	Jupax aka libro akan uñjäna.
It used to be, but it wasn't.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
In fact, she wondered where he had gone that day.	Chiqansa, kawkirus uka urux saräna sasaw jisktʼasïna.
This is obvious.	Ukajj qhanaw uñjasi.
Or so he told me.	Jan ukajj ukham sitäna.
Tell me what you know.	Kuntï yatkta ukjja, yatiyapjjeta.
Tonight was really good.	Jichha arumax chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
Today is going to be a good day.	Jichhürojj wali suma uruw utjani.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Jupajj kunas paskäna uk wal yatiñ munäna.
I’ve always liked that.	Nayatakix nayratpachaw ukax wali askïspa.
I like everything, I like it.	Nayax taqi kunas wali askiwa, wali askiwa.
He almost had to.	Jupajj niyaw ukham lurañajj wakisïna.
He does what he wants.	Kuntï munki uk luraski.
In this case, he said something.	Uka tuqitxa, jupax kuns sänwa.
Something like that can happen.	Ukham mä kunaw pasaspa.
Couldn't be in a worse place.	Janiw jukʼamp jan wali cheqan utjkaspati.
He understood this very well.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa amuyasïna.
I started taking it.	Nayax uka apsuñ qalltawayta.
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkiti.
He said he was too sorry.	Jupajj sinti llakistwa sasaw säna.
I don’t know when.	Nayax janiw kuna pachas uk yatkti.
That’s exactly what happens in this country.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw aka markanx utji.
That is absolutely nothing.	Ukajj janipuniw kunäkisa.
That was just the beginning.	Ukajj jichhakiw qalltäna.
He was in awe of her.	Jupajj jupat wal muspharäna.
He made the film and it made him.	Jupax uka película luratayna ukat ukax jupar luratayna.
Of course, both are valid.	Chiqansa, panpachaniw walikïskiti.
A spacious, comfortable room.	Mä jach’a, suma cuarto.
So many times it is not.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw jan ukhamäkiti.
He told them to.	Jupaw jupanakar säna.
He will love me very much.	Jupajj nayarojj wal munasini.
But something needs to be done.	Ukampis kun lurañaw wakisi.
You can’t do it there.	Janiw ukan lurañjamäkiti.
But this is a very uncomfortable situation.	Ukampis ukajj wali jan walin uñjasi.
It just looked ugly.	Ukajj jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But no one wants to see it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk uñjañ munkiti.
What do you think of it.	Kunsa jumax amuyta.
Of course, that would be more effective.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax jukʼamp askïspawa.
He knows exactly where everything is.	Jupajj kawkhansa taqe kunas utji uk sum yati.
He’s the one who’s done it all.	Jupaw taqe ukanak lurawayi.
He’s a great teacher.	Jupax wali jach’a yatichiriwa.
And that’s really good.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
To this day, I don't remember anything about it.	Jichhakamajj janiw uka toqet kunsa amtaskti.
He pulled hard.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw jaqontäna.
Twice, or maybe three times.	Pä kuti, jan ukax inas kimsa kuti.
Something great, he said.	Kunas jach’a, sasaw säna.
He told me with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw nayar yatiyäna.
I prefer that one.	Nayax ukaruw juk’amp munta.
I have a beer myself.	Naya pachpaw mä cerveza utjitu.
He was a very human being.	Jupajj wali jaqënwa.
And that’s not .	Ukat ukajj janiw .
I’m going to sleep.	Nayax ikiñar sarä.
It's going to be very nice.	Wali sumaw saraski.
Good, he said earnestly.	Suma, sasaw taqi chuyma säna.
That quickly ended it all.	Ukajj jankʼakiw taqe ukanak tukuyäna.
It’s not like that, either.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, jan ukax.
Now someone needs them.	Jichhax mayniw jupanakar munasi.
It leaves something for me.	Nayatakix kuns jaytawayi.
He as he said so.	Jupajj kunjamtï ukham siskäna ukhama.
It looks so beautiful.	Ukhama suma uñtatawa.
I don't understand it well.	Janiw sum amuykti.
But not above all else.	Ukampis janiw taqe kunat sipansa.
He had already died.	Jupajj nayraw jiwjjäna.
He told me exactly what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk sumwa sitäna.
One thing we have is clear.	Mä kunaw utjistu, ukax qhanawa.
You told him that.	Jumaw jupar ukham sista.
And more, and more.	Ukat juk’ampi, ukat juk’ampi.
I want to tell everyone tonight.	Jichha arumax taqiniruw yatiyañ munta.
He said it the other night.	Jupax yaqha arumax ukham arsüna.
Almost every night.	Niya sapa arumaw ukham sarnaqäna.
But why would you do that?.	Ukampis ¿kunatsa ukham lurasma?.
But he wanted to know.	Ukampis jupajj uk yatiñwa munäna.
The facts were clear.	Kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Not a nice word.	Janiw mä suma aru.
But there really is no problem.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
But that doesn't seem to work very well.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
No one can do that for us.	Janiw khitis jiwasatak uk lurkaspati.
This year promises to be the best so far!.	Jichha marax jichhakamax wali sumaw sasaw arsuwayi!.
He came with more caution.	Jupajj jukʼamp amuyumpiw jutäna.
Besides myself, no one knows.	Naya pachpat sipansa, janiw khitis yatkiti.
It’s really cool, too.	Chiqpachansa wali ch’amawa, ukhamaraki.
He said yes, eventually.	Jupajj jïsa sasaw säna, qhepatjja.
But it wasn't what he had planned.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jupajj amtkäna ukhamäkänti.
Here she is, now.	Akax jupax, jichhax.
There can never be such a thing.	Janipuniw ukham utjkaspati.
I’ve seen these things.	Nayax ukanak uñjta.
He’s depressed now.	Jupax jichhax llakitaw jikxatasi.
He obviously knows nothing about it.	Uka toqet janiw kuns yatkiti, ukajj qhanawa.
I’m still alone right now.	Jichhax wali sapakiw jikxatastxa.
You’re the best there.	Jumax ukanx wali sumawa.
One of his own perhaps.	Mä jupan pachpa inas.
You are amazing!!!!!.	Jumax muspharkañawa!!!!!.
But there was no time.	Ukampis janiw kuna horasas utjkänti.
I'm not saying it here.	Nayajj janiw akan siskti.
Things don’t work well.	Kunanakas janiw sum irnaqkiti.
He really wanted to do it.	Chiqpachansa, uk lurañwa munäna.
Either something is okay or it doesn’t work.	Jan ukax kunas walikïskiwa jan ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
It’s what he tells them.	Kunjamtï jupanakar siski ukawa.
They can’t afford it.	Jupanakax janiw qullqix utjkaspati.
That’s how it feels to me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix amuyasi.
The best time is breakfast.	Wali suma pachax desayuno ukawa.
It all looks lovely.	Taqi ukanakax wali munasiñampiw uñtasi.
It’s weird but amazing.	Ukax muspharkañawa ukampis muspharkañawa.
I knew about it well.	Uka toqet sum yatiyäta.
Is it worth it for you?.	Jumatakix wali askiwa?.
But that doesn't work for me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj walïkiti.
I hope this is useful.	Nayax suyt’twa akax wali askïspa.
Large and extremely small.	Jach’a ukat sinti jisk’a.
A year or a little more.	Mä mara jan ukax mä juk’a jila.
He knew almost exactly how she felt.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasïna uk niyaw sum yatïna.
For me, he is .	Nayatakejj jupajj .
He’s waiting outside.	Jupax anqan suyt’aski.
That happened the day before.	Ukajj nayrïr uruw pasäna.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Nayajj janiw qharürojj lurirjamäkti.
You always have some rain.	Jumax sapa kutiw mä juk’a jallu purini.
But no one out there knows about it.	Ukampis janiw khitis anqan uka toqet yatkiti.
There was no time limit.	Janiw kuna tiempos utjkänti.
Yesterday it wasn't.	Qharürojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He now decided what to do.	Jupajj jichhajj kun lurañsa amtäna.
He wants to be alone a bit.	Jupajj sapakiw mä jukʼa sarnaqañ muni.
Yours is the same.	Juman ukhamaraki.
It means talking.	Ukax parlañ sañ muni.
He didn't care why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw kuns lurkänti.
He doesn’t want to use his name.	Janiw sutip apnaqañ munkiti.
It looks as safe as new.	Machaq uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamaw jan kuna jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
I’ve been doing this for quite some time.	Nayax mä qawqha pachaw ukham lurawayta.
Whoever you are.	Khitis jumajj ukjja.
In fact, not before at all.	Chiqansa, janiw nayrax kunjamatsa.
So he stayed behind.	Ukatwa qhepat qheparäna.
Small and ugly.	Jisk’a ukat jan wali.
It says all of this truthfully.	Taqi ukanak chiqpachapuniw arsu.
No, he said he didn’t want to eat.	Janiwa, janiwa manq’añ munkiti sasaw säna.
These are very popular now.	Ukanakax jichhax wali uñt’atawa.
He wanted to know everything.	Jupajj taqe kunat yatiñwa munäna.
He doesn't mean it's a problem.	Jupax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis sañ munkiti.
He threw the stone away.	Jupajj uka qala jaqontäna.
Did it again, same.	Wasitat lurawayta, pachpa.
Whatever hours he worked.	Kuna horasas jupajj irnaqäna.
There was no time for anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañatakejj tiempojj utjkänti.
But obviously something is happening.	Ukampis qhanaw kunas pasaski.
I'm a young man.	Nayajj mä waynawa.
Nothing works for me.	Janiw kunas nayatakix irnaqkiti.
What to do next.	Kunsa jutïrin lurañama.
This is a great one.	Akax mä jach’a.
The more the better.	Uka juk’ampi juk’ampi suma.
Maybe he should go.	Inas jupajj sarañapa.
He threw himself on the bed.	Jupajj ikiñar jaqontäna.
I’ve noticed something.	Nayax mä kuns uñjta.
I really like those people.	Uka jaqenakajj nayatakejj wal gustitu.
I don't remember many more.	Janiw jukʼamp walja amtaskti.
You people can’t do it.	Jumanakax jaqinakax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I see it as a film within a film.	Mä película manqhan mä película ukham uñjta.
So maybe we are all we need.	Ukhamajj inas jiwasajj taqe kunas wakisispa.
Yeah, but that's fine.	Jïsa, ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa.
I asked again, again nothing.	Nayax wasitat jiskt’asta, wasitat janiw kunas utjkänti.
Any time now .	Kuna pachas jichhax .
I didn’t mean to tell him that.	Janiw nayax jupar ukham sañ munkayätti.
And maybe you are too.	Ukat inas jumax ukhamaraki.
They are human-like.	Jupanakax jaqir uñtatawa.
You really should do that.	Chiqpachansa, jumax ukham lurañamawa.
I don't really do that.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun ukham lurkti.
He advised that he did not.	Janiw ukham lurkti sasaw ewjjtʼäna.
He knew all about it.	Jupajj taqe ukanak sum yatïna.
You know what the future holds.	Kunanakas jutïrin utjani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
He hoped there would be none.	Jupajj janiw utjkaniti sasaw suyäna.
They really are awesome.	Chiqpachansa jupanakax wali muspharkañawa.
I realized this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk amuyayäta.
I thought it was you.	Nayajj jumajj sasaw amuyayäta.

What could I have done wrong.	¿Kunsa nayajj jan wal luraspäna.
That's why he does it.	Ukatwa jupajj uk luri.
I'm going to hurry up.	Nayajj jankʼakiw sarä.
He wondered what it was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He knew what could happen to him now.	Kunas jichhajj jupar pasaspa uk sum yatïna.
But I really like him.	Ukampis nayajj jupar wal gustitu.
I'm going to like it a lot.	Nayajj walpun gustitu.
It doesn’t matter at this point.	Aka pachanx janiw kunas wakiskiti.
I like you guys.	Nayajj jumaruw gustitu.
Everything that happens, happens now.	Taqi kunatix luraski, jichhax luraski.
Tomorrow is the day.	Qhipürux uruw purini.
He obviously can.	Jupajj qhanaw ukham luraspa.
It was excellent in that respect.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumapunïnwa.
I never want to do that again.	Janipuniw mayampsa ukham lurañ munkti.

Of course he has nothing.	Chiqansa jupax janiw kunas utjkiti.
It will be as it has always been.	Kunjamtï nayrajj paskäna ukhamarakiw utjani.
There really is no problem.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
They are beautiful but for one thing.	Jupanakax wali sumaw ukampis mä tuqitxa.
What could that mean.	Kunsa ukajj sañ munpachäna.
Maybe you do a good but not great job.	Inas jumax mä suma ukampis jan jach’a irnaqäw lurasma.
The process takes time, of course.	Uka lurañax tiempow munasispa, chiqpachansa.
After all, who ever wanted that.	Chiqansa, khitis nayrax ukham munäna.
Well, now no more.	Ukhama, jichhax janiw juk’ampi.
But, this is wrong.	Ukampis, akax janiw walïkiti.
If that sounds good to you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askïspa ukhaxa.
They’re gorgeous, actually.	Jupanakax wali sumaw uñjasi, chiqpachansa.
But all along he knew exactly what he wanted.	Ukampis taqe tiemponjja, kuntï munkäna uk sum yatïna.
But there are no rich people.	Ukampis janiw qamir jaqenakajj utjkiti.
I hope no one ever does.	Nayax suyt’twa janiw khitis janipuniw ukham lurkaspati.
It used to be ten days.	Nayrajj tunka uruw utjäna.
That is pretty obvious to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali qhanawa.
He went there quickly.	Ukaruw jankʼak saräna.
Then he asked why.	Ukat kunatsa sasaw jisktʼäna.
First time for me now also.	Nayrïr kutiw nayatakix jichhax ukhamaraki.
Everything started moving quickly.	Taqi kunas jank’akiw sarnaqañ qalltäna.
He knows the words well.	Jupajj uka arunak sum yati.
And often, it’s very difficult.	Ukat walja kutix, wali ch’amawa.
And that was all he wanted.	Ukat ukakiw jupajj munäna.
But it’s good for you and yours.	Ukampis jumatakix ukat jumatakix wali askiwa.
But it can do almost anything.	Ukampis niya taqe ukanak luraspawa.
He usually does it in the morning.	Jupax alwax lurañ yati.
This is just so beautiful.	Akax ukhamakiw wali suma.
Absolutely, this time.	Chiqpachansa, aka kutix.
The first thing .	Nayrïr kunaw .
I don’t see him much.	Janiw jupar wal uñjkti.
He had no problem with it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Of course, no one really knew what to do.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kun lurañsa yatkänti.
I think that’s the hardest part.	Nayatakix ukax wali ch’amawa.
Today was different.	Jichhürojj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He was so sorry it wasn’t.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna janiw ukhamäkiti.
He just walked so fast.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jankʼak sarnaqäna.
Good coffee, too.	Suma café, ukhamaraki.
We’re yes.	Jiwasax jïsa.
Wine, you’re a bad guy.	Vino, jumax jan wali jaqiwa.
But after that, .	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, .
It’s going to be a good night.	Mä suma arumaw utjani.
It lasted about an hour.	Niya mä horaw utjäna.
That strange voice.	Uka muspharkañ aru.
But, but .	Ukampis, ukampis .
Why, he didn’t really say.	Kunatsa, janiw chiqpachapunix siskänti.
He didn't know why now.	Kunatsa jichhajj uk janiw yatkänti.
Or because it’s hard.	Jan ukax kunatix ch’amawa.
Again he refused to answer.	Ukat wasitatwa jupajj jan arsüna.
I like it a lot .	Nayax walpun munta .
This may be seen in two ways.	Ukajj inas pä toqetwa uñjasispa.
This is actually quite surprising.	Chiqansa akax wali muspharkañawa.
That was all he knew.	Ukakiw jupajj sum yatïna.
Both of them this time.	Panpachaniw aka kutix.
Someone took care of it.	Mayniw uka tuqit sum uñjäna.
I can use all the great words.	Taqi jach’a arunak apnaqañ yatta.
You can’t do anything too serious.	Janiw kunas sinti jach’a lurañax utjkaspati.
So yeah, it’s cool.	Ukhamajj jïsa, wali sumawa.
You are the one I need.	Jumax khititix nayar munkta ukawa.
Everything is clear to me now.	Jichhax nayatakix taqi kunas qhanawa.
So he is better.	Ukhamajj jupajj jukʼamp askiwa.
No one understands them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar amuykiti.
I made him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar lurawayta.
More water.	Juk’ampi uma.
Or maybe the other way around.	Jan ukajj inas yaqha tuqitxa.
He never quite understood why.	Kunatsa uk janipuniw sum amuykänti.
It’s every .	Ukax sapa .
He did it with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw uk luräna.
He didn't want to go with her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp sarañ munkänti.
But let’s do it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk lurañäni.
We’re kind of .	Jiwasax mä kasta .
Of course, we have some work to do.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa lurañaw utjistu.
That’s kind of fun.	Ukax mä juk’a kusiskañawa.
But that’s exactly what you need to do.	Ukampis chiqpachapunix ukham lurañaw wakisi.
I didn’t see anything.	Janiw kunas uñjkti.
He just made the phone call.	Jupajj ukhamakiw telefonot jawsäna.
It was a small world.	Ukajj mä jiskʼa pachaw utjäna.
How long will it take.	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani.
That didn't mean all that.	Ukajj janiw ukanak taqe kuns sañ munkänti.
It means you shouldn’t do that.	Janiw ukham lurañamäkiti sañ muni.
And he’s happy, now.	Ukat jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi, jichhax.
Actually, I don't like it very much.	Chiqansa, janiw sinti gustkituti.
Let me know how things are going.	Kunjamsa kunas saraski uk yatiyapxita.
We need the power.	Jiwasax ch’amaw munasispa.
He started talking to me again.	Jupajj wasitatwa nayamp parlañ qalltäna.
No one knows what to make of him.	Janiw khitis kunsa jupat lurañapa uk yatkiti.
I want to do more and learn more.	Nayax juk’amp lurañ munta ukat juk’amp yatxatañ munta.
What happened to me didn't matter.	Kunatï nayar paskäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
But, it is wholehearted.	Ukampis, taqe chuymaw ukajja.
He will get there soon.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka cheqar purini.
We need something more.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp kunaw munasispa.
But you guys are beautiful.	Ukampis jumanakajj wali sumawa.
Of course, it had to be done.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
These are listed below.	Ukanakax akham uñt’atawa.
So we have to do the right thing for that.	Ukhamajj ukatakejj wali sumwa lurañasa.
A living wage, yes.	Mä jakañ qullqi, jïsa.
Of course, he didn't quite know how.	Chiqansa, kunjamsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Very good kind, too.	Wali suma kasta, ukhamaraki.
Something but nothing.	Kunas ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
I've done it all before.	Nayrajj taqe ukanak lurawayta.
It all felt so intense.	Taqi ukax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
I don't know where he is now.	Jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk janiw yatkti.
More every year.	Sapa maraw juk’ampi.
It’s less and less.	Ukax juk’akiw juk’ampi.
He couldn't go to bed.	Jupajj janiw ikiñar sarañ puedkänti.
He didn't know what it really was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj cheqpachapun uk janiw yatkänti.
That alone would be enough.	Uka sapakiw wakisispa.
He didn't want to drink alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak umañ munkänti.
How he threw it.	Kunjamsa jupajj jaqontäna.
He worked quietly.	Jupax amukiw irnaqäna.
Someone called them.	Mayniw jupanakar jawsäna.
She gave him a long ride.	Jupajj mä jachʼa kayuk churäna.
I am so happy to see you.	Jumanakar uñjasajj walpun kusista.
But he seemed to know exactly how it would turn out.	Ukampis kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk sum yatkaspa ukhamwa amuyasïna.
That’s too much of a stranger.	Ukax sinti mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
I was afraid of myself.	Naya pachpaw ajjsarayäta.
During that time you .	Uka pachanx jumax .
You can’t do everything.	Janiw taqi kuns lurañjamäkiti.
I didn't want to live with me.	Nayajj janiw nayamp jakañ munkayätti.
He could not use words.	Jupajj janiw arunak apnaqañ puedkänti.
People are known for that.	Jaqinakax ukham uñt'atawa.
It’s fast and effective.	Ukax juk’amp jaya ukat wali askiwa.
Maybe this year is enough.	Inas aka marax wakischispa.
He doesn’t really know how to go about it.	Jupax janiw chiqpachapunix kunjams uka tuqit sarañ yatkiti.
And it sneaks up on you.	Ukat ukax jumaruw jamasat purini.
I know that doesn't matter to you.	Nayajj yattwa, ukajj janiw jumatakejj kunäkisa.
And it doesn’t, of course.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Money doesn’t matter.	Qullqix janiw kunäkisa.
Maybe that's enough .	Inas ukajj wakischispa .
It is better than good.	Suma lurañat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
What's what's necessary.	Kunas kunas wakisi.
So there is no need to innovate.	Ukhamajj janiw machaq lurañajj wakiskiti.
He knows bad things about me.	Jupax nayat jan walinak yati.
Something like that .	Kunas ukham .
Later some more.	Qhipharux mä qawqha juk’ampi.
He knew he would.	Jupajj ukham lurañap yatïna.
I didn't know how to tell you.	Janiw nayajj kunjamsa jumar yatiyañ yatkayätti.
This is obvious .	Ukajj qhanaw amuyasi .
You don’t have to do anything at this point.	Aka pachanx janiw kuna lurañas jumatakix wakiskiti.
He always wants to improve.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jukʼamp sum lurañ muni.
So that's what he meant.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj sañ munäna.
That had not yet happened.	Ukajj janiw jichhakamax utjkänti.
And it can’t be that way.	Ukat janiw ukham utjkaspati.
A small country trip maybe.	Mä jisk’a markar sarañax inas.
I just don't want to see that happen.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurasiñap uñjañ munkti.
And everything else is.	Ukat taqi kunas ukhamawa.
Never give up on this.	Janipuniw aka tuqitxa jaytañamäkiti.
How do you feel about it?.	¿Kunjamsa jumajj jikjjatasta?.
Now he can do it.	Jichhax jupax luraspawa.
Things can be anything, of course.	Kunanakas kunas utjaspa, chiqpachansa.
But he means nothing to me.	Ukampis jupax janiw nayatakix kuns sañ munkiti.
He just moved to town.	Jupax jichhakiw markar sarxi.
I feel it when I need or want it.	Kunapachatï wakiski jan ukajj munkta ukhaw ukham jikjjatasta.
They are the .	Jupanakax uka .
There was no other school.	Janiw yaqha yatiqañ utax utjkänti.

He knew what would happen if he did.	Ukham luraspa ukhajja, kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.

Truth here at least.	Chiqaw akanx mä juk’a.
I don’t have that kind of money.	Nayax janiw ukham qullqix utjkituti.
Tomorrow is another day and all that.	Qhipürux yaqha uruw ukat taqi ukanak.
I think he’s an amazing person.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali muspharkañ jaqiwa.
I did not fully understand the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw sum amuykayätti.
I knew so much about him.	Nayajj jupat walpun yatiyäta.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Ukajj chʼamakiwa, ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
I'm the guy .	Nayajj uka jaqejj .
It really really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
No, it's different.	Janiwa, yaqha.
I am well aware of this.	Nayax uka tuqit sum yatta.
In fact, it was everything.	Chiqansa, taqi kunas ukhamänwa.
He quietly called her name.	Jupax amukiw sutip jawsäna.
And that is not good for us.	Ukat ukajj janiw jiwasatak walïkiti.
It was really good, too.	Chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa, ukhamaraki.
I disagree, of course.	Nayax janiw iyaw siskti, chiqpachansa.
He will never, ever, be the guy.	Jupax janipuniw, janipuniw, uka waynax utjkaniti.
Her feelings for him were obvious.	Jupajj jupat kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk qhanaw amuyasïna.
I just heard it again.	Jichhakiw wasitat istʼta.
I’m going to give it three days.	Nayax kimsa uruw churañ munta.

We just can’t do that.	Jiwasax janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
The ride is easy.	Uka kayuk sarañax wali ch’amawa.
There's such a thing.	Kuna kasta.
That’s what started it all.	Ukaw taqe kun qalltäna.
You don’t have any money.	Jumax janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
And he’s a terrible person.	Ukat jupax wali axsarkañ jaqiwa.
He came to see you three times.	Jupajj kimsa kutiw jumar uñjir jutäna.
So it would be better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askïspawa.
But, it wasn't enough.	Ukampis, janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
He wanted to know what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk yatiñwa munäna.
I want to live in that house.	Nayax uka utan jakañ munta.
I don't want to eat it.	Janiw manq'añ munkti.
Much better, in fact.	Walja suma, chiqpachansa.
You know, whatever it is, it’s funny.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunatix utjki ukax wali muspharkañawa.
Anyway, it's nice and delicious.	Kawkhansa, wali sumawa ukat wali sumawa.
At least that’s okay.	Mä juk’a pachax ukax walikïskiwa.
No, it looks awesome.	Janiwa, wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
Now, about how it felt.	Jichhax, kunjams jikxatasïna uka tuqit.
There was nothing there, not yet.	Ukanx janiw kunas utjkänti, janiw jichhakamax utjkänti.
It wasn’t in the house.	Janiw uka utan utjkänti.
He wanted that to happen.	Jupajj ukham pasañap wal munäna.
Yes, it’s more than that.	Jïsa, ukat sipansa.
I think you understand that.	Nayax amuyta, jumax uk amuyta.
You have no way of doing this .	Jumax janiw kunjamatsa aka .
He’s quiet now, at home.	Jupax jichhax amukiw jikxatasi, utan.
I think this was pretty good.	Nayax amuyta akax wali sumapunïnwa.
He wants to see you very much.	Jupajj jumar wal uñjañ muni.
But, that doesn’t mean much.	Ukampis, ukax janiw sinti sañ munkiti.
Everything one could really want is there.	Taqi kunatï maynix chiqpachapuni munkaspa ukanakaw utji.
That was a big maybe.	Ukax mä jach’a inas ukhamänwa.
Of course, not everything is like that.	Chiqansa, janiw taqi kunas ukham utjkaspati.
He never did a thing for me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayatak mä jukʼa lurkänti.
You can’t do these things.	Janiw ukanak lurañax utjkaspati.
Maybe there’s something for you.	Inas jumatakix kunas utjaspa.
He was the wrong person for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj jan wali jaqënwa.
And this is exactly what happens.	Ukat akax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
But I’m still enjoying the ride.	Ukampis uka kayuk sarañax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He felt better immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
No, he was upset.	Janiwa, jupax chuym ch’allxtayäna.
He started working.	Jupax irnaqañ qalltäna.
He’s getting better and better.	Jupax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He’s not good enough right now.	Jupax janiw jichhax askïkiti.
Of course, this is not really the case.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
Beautiful sum sum.	Suma suma suma.
You can do it very well.	Jumax wali sumaw lurasma.
I want to go home.	Nayax utar sarañ munta.
There was no problem with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
And he gave me that gift.	Ukat jupaw uka regalo churitu.
Why, he could do that every day.	Kunatsa, sapa uruw ukham luraspäna.
Don’t do too much nothing.	Janiw sinti jan kuns lurañamäkiti.
That's something I want to take away.	Ukajj mä jukʼa apsuñ munta.
The whole process will take years.	Taqi uka lurañax walja maranakaw munasini.
It doesn’t seem like it’s worth it.	Janiw ukax askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He knew how to pull it off.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk apsuñ yatïna.
But something will happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani.
This does not mean that it is the same person.	Ukajj janiw uka pachpa jaqëkaspas ukham sañ munkiti.
Nothing is ever too bad.	Janipuniw kunas sinti jan walïkiti.
But I can't quite figure it out.	Ukampis janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
You have to avoid that.	Jumax ukanak jan lurañamawa.
I think he’s a good guy.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He told me what I wanted to do.	Jupaw kun lurañsa munta uk sitäna.
Do it, do it now!.	¡Ukham luram, jichhax luram!.
He never did anything like that to me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayarojj ukham kuns lurkänti.
Beyond that area.	Uka chiqat juk’ampi.
That never happened.	Ukax janipuniw utjkänti.
He was half right.	Jupax chikat chiqaw säna.
Of course, someone has to do it.	Chiqansa, mayniw uk lurañapa.
I don’t think we need to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
It rubbed off on me.	Ukajj nayaruw chʼalljjtayasïna.
I think that’s what you want.	Nayax amuyta ukax kuntix jumax munkta ukawa.
He thought he was about to arrive.	Jupajj niyaw purini sasaw amuyäna.
A huge amount of money.	Mä jachʼa qollqe.
Don't give up that chance.	Janiw uka chʼam jaytañamäkiti.
Then repeat the process.	Ukat uka lurañanak mayamp lurañama.
I feel so quick.	Nayax ukhama jank’akiw jikxatastxa.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Jupajj janiw kunsa uka toqet lurañap yatkänti.
I really like him.	Nayax juparux chiqpachapuniw munta.
But he didn't want to leave immediately.	Ukampis janiw jankʼak sarxañ munkänti.
Another day or so.	Yaqha uru jan ukax ukhama.

It was harder in the winter.	Juyphi pachanx juk’amp ch’amaw jikxatasïna.
This took a year.	Ukatakejj mä maraw munasïna.
But it never happened to me.	Ukampis janipuniw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.
He stayed there for a decade or more.	Tunka mara jan ukajj jukʼamp maranakaw ukan qheparäna.
You want to be like that.	Jumax ukham munasma.
What can one do.	Kunas maynix luraspa.
But that was not the case today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
That’s what I’m most excited about this year.	Ukax nayatakix aka marax wali kusiskañawa.
He seems like a real good guy.	Jupajj cheqpach suma jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
Surely this is what someone wanted, he thought.	Chiqpachansa akax maynix munkäna ukawa, sasaw amuyäna.
He seems to be a different kind of person.	Jupajj yaqha kasta jaqëkaspas ukhamawa.
But then it will sneak up on you.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jumaruw jamasat jutani.
I want to go to school.	Nayax yatiqañ utar sarañ munta.
He never needs to do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
I went to see him almost every day.	Niya sapa uruw jupar uñjir sarawayta.
He was already looking at her.	Jupajj niyaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.

And that word.	Ukat uka aru.
He could do three things.	Kimsa lurañanak luraspäna.
You have to do everything you can about it.	Uka tuqitxa taqi kunsa lurañaw wakisi.
He went home early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat utar sarjjäna.

I don’t see much of that.	Ukanakat janiw sinti uñjkti.

She didn't like him all that much.	Jupajj janiw jupar taqpach gustkänti.
That’s pretty common here.	Ukax akanx wali uñt’atawa.
Today was a little sad.	Jichhürojj mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
It started to rain a little.	Mä juk’a jallu puriñ qalltäna.
He wanted to go big or go home.	Jupax jach’a sarañ jan ukax utar sarañ munäna.
There will be something for you.	Kunas jumatakix utjani.
I’ve seen both.	Nayax panpachaniw uñjta.

But thank you very much.	Ukampis jumanakajj walpun yuspärta.
I promised everyone.	Nayax taqiniruw arsuwayta.
Maybe I tried too hard.	Inas sinti chʼamachasiyäta.
But that's not why it started in the first place.	Ukampis janiw ukatwa nayrïr kutin ukajj qalltäna.
He made this film.	Jupaw aka película luratayna.
I have nothing to say about this.	Nayax janiw kuns aka tuqit arsuñ munkti.
Maybe you want to make it bigger.	Inas jumax juk’amp jach’a lurañ munsta.
I didn’t want to get on the phone.	Janiw telefonot ukar mantañ munkayätti.
At the time he didn’t realize how long.	Uka pachanx jupax janiw qawqha pachas amuyaskänti.
But that was a foreigner.	Ukampis ukajj yaqha markankir jaqënwa.
But nothing after that.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka qhepat utjkänti.
He’s the one who knows it.	Jupaw uk yattwa.
I went to see it.	Nayax uñjir sarawayta.
It really doesn’t work that way.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
Blood and that.	Wila ukat ukax.
Then someone came along.	Ukat mayniw jutäna.
That seems pretty obvious to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali qhanaw amuyasi.
He told her what had happened.	Jupaw kunas pasäna uk yatiyäna.
And winter has just arrived.	Ukat juyphi pachax jichhakiw purini.
You are the one who wants the money.	Jumax khititix qullqi munkta ukawa.
Not after what he did.	Janiw kuntï lurkäna uka qhepatjja.

There’s a huge opportunity out there.	Uka chiqanx mä jach’a oportunidad ukaw utji.

But now he was alone.	Ukampis jichhajj jupajj sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
There was nothing to do, really.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
It was very fast and very quiet.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna ukat wali amukiw sarnaqäna.
First decade ago.	Nayrïr tunka mara nayra.
But he doesn't want to talk any more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp parlañ munkiti.

But that doesn't matter to you.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jumatak wakiskiti.
But that was a good decade ago.	Ukampis ukajj tunka mara nayrajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He spoke to himself again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupa pachpa parläna.
It said what it said.	Ukajj kuntï siskäna uk sänwa.
He’s definitely there.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw utji.
Everything worked as it should.	Taqi kunas kunjamtï lurañapäki ukhamaw irnaqäna.
You know that’s wrong.	Jumax yatisktawa ukax janiw walïkiti.
Both are just as good.	Panpachaniw ukhamarakiw wali suma.
This is obviously unnecessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti, ukajj qhanawa.
After that, he wanted nothing to do with me.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkänti.
It was the real thing.	Ukajj cheqpach ukhamänwa.
This was in a strange way.	Ukajj mä muspharkañ toqetwa amuyasïna.
I think he’s awesome.	Nayax amuyta jupax wali muspharkañawa.
They’re all not right.	Taqi jupanakax janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
If you want, you can create something new.	Jumatix munsta ukhax machaq lurañanak lurasma.
You may want to attend.	Inas jumax uka tantachäwir sarañ munsta.
No one can repeat what happened here.	Kuntï akan paskäna uk janiw khitis wasitat lurkaspati.
Something wanted to go wrong.	Kunas jan walinak lurañ munäna.
Anything can happen, and it happens often.	Kunas pasaspa, ukat walja kutiw pasaspa.
And I really like him.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw juparux gustitu.
I think it’s really funny.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyta.
I was scared for the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw ajjsarayäta.
He was too excited.	Jupajj sinti kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I don’t really understand anything.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix kuns amuyta.
But then it goes further.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw saraski.
Not a bad beer.	Janiw mä jan wali cerveza.

He said everything quietly.	Jupax taqi kuns amukiw säna.
He worked really hard.	Chiqpachansa wali chʼamampiw irnaqäna.
It was the only thing he could do.	Uka sapakiw lurañ yatïna.
Of course, he never said that.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukham siskänti.
I don’t know, myself.	Nayax janiw yatkti, naya pachpa.

But it came a few times.	Ukampis mä qhawqha kutiw jutäna.
That’s obviously something that can be done.	Ukax qhanaw kunatix lurañjamäki ukhama.
He told me everything about himself.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupa pachpat yatiyäna.
You have a nothing.	Jumax mä janiw kunas utjkiti.
He seems to be fine so far.	Jupax jichhakamax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.

I don't see him any more.	Nayajj janiw jupar jukʼamp uñjkti.
Everything you can think of.	Taqi kunatix jumax amuyta.
But it really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachapunix janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s a very cool guy.	Jupax wali thaya jaqiwa.
I really hope he does.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw suyt’askta jupax ukham lurani.
He was devastated and depressed.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
And now he realized a new problem.	Ukat jichhax mä machaq jan waltʼäwit amuyasïna.
I understand the problem.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj sum amuyasta.
He didn't want to live.	Jupajj janiw jakañ munkänti.
That was not the case in the past.	Nayra tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
That really surprises me.	Ukax chiqpachansa nayatakix muspharkañawa.
It’s a little rough.	Mä juk’a qhuru.
That one was really good.	Uka maynix chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
Slightly slice the slice.	Mä juk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Not a good deal of money.	Janiw mä suma qullqis utjkiti.
Too good, in fact.	Sinti sumawa, chiqpachansa.
Do what you think is impossible.	Kuntï jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykta uk lurañamawa.
That’s a big chunk of it.	Ukax mä jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I immediately fell in love with them.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupanakar munasta.
He just threw it away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jaqontäna.
But it wasn’t real baseball.	Ukampis janiw chiqpach béisbol lurañax utjkänti.
I have said this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham arsuwayta.
He knew what the future held.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.

You're coming.	Jumaw jutta.
I knew what was going to happen next there.	Ukan qhepat kunas pasani uk sum yatiyäta.
I understand this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk sum amuyasta.
Now that’s really rare these days.	Jichhax chiqpachansa ukax aka urunakanx juk’akiw utji.
But that is an important part of the process.	Ukampis ukajj uka lurañatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
I’m doing the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw luraskta.
I saw a report yesterday.	Nayax qharüruw mä yatiyäw uñjta.
But he didn’t want that, of course.	Ukampis janiw uk munkänti, chiqpachansa.
He’s the one who says the words.	Jupaw uka arunak arsu.
These are soft or flaky.	Ukanakax llamp’u jan ukax ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Maybe it’s so bad.	Inas ukhama jan wali.
Of course, longer is longer.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp tiempow jukʼamp tiempo.
He’s amazing.	Jupax muspharkañawa.
No one wants to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañ munkiti.
Interesting, isn’t it?.	Wali muspharkañawa, ¿janich ukhamäki?.
No one really knows what happened next.	Uka qhepat kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis cheqapuni yatkiti.
He wants nothing more to do with you.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jumamp lurañ munkiti.
And he did well in that part.	Ukat jupax wali sumwa uka chiqanx luräna.
You look smaller.	Jumax juk’amp jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
You are always .	Jumax sapa kutiw .
But today, it is.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, ukhamawa.
It’s better there.	Ukanx juk’amp askiwa.
I gave up coffee last month.	Nayax pasïr phaxsinx café jaytawayta.
And that would be another stupid thing to do.	Ukat ukajj yaqha loqhe lurañaw utjaspa.
That’s the first thing he did.	Ukaw nayrïr kutix luratayna.
He had seen them before.	Jupajj nayraw jupanakar uñjäna.
But he looked happy.	Ukampis jupajj kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
Another kind of language.	Yaqha kasta aru.
I don’t know exactly where.	Janiw kawkhans uk sum yatkti.
You can’t have them.	Janiw jupanakar utjkaspati.
He wanted no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp munkänti.
Currently there isn’t one.	Jichhax janiw mä utjkiti.
I’m passionate about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali munasiñampiw uñjta.
I had a quiet breakfast.	Nayajj mä amukiw desayuno lurayäta.
I can’t believe the price.	Nayax janiw uka qullqix iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He was the first to leave.	Jupaw nayrïr kuti sarxäna.
He rode faster.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw kayuk saräna.
Something’s wrong there.	Kunas ukan jan walïkiti.
I didn’t know how to tell.	Nayax janiw kunjams yatiyañ yatkayätti.
And one that can ultimately be a very long time away.	Ukat mä ukax qhipharux wali jaya pachaw utjaspa.
Not everyone knows everything about me.	Janiw taqenis nayat taqe kun yatipkiti.
I didn’t get this though.	Nayax janiw akax jikxatkti ukampis.
It sat there comfortably for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj wali sumaw ukan qontʼasïna.
He thought she was beautiful.	Jupajj wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.

That’s how he worked.	Ukhamaw jupajj irnaqäna.
That’s not good though.	Ukax janiw askïkiti ukampis.
Fortunately, he didn't think so.	Ukampis wali askiwa, janiw jupajj ukham amuykänti.
He was a good man, he knew it.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And therefore .	Ukat ukatwa .
Anything could have done.	Kunas luraspäna.
He needed help.	Jupaw yanaptʼa munäna.
I did this but not much.	Nayax uk lurawayta ukampis janiw sinti lurkti.
Because, there is no permission.	Kunatix, janiw kuna permiso ukax utjkiti.
He seemed to know all along.	Jupajj taqe tiempo yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He came all over me.	Jupajj taqpach nayaruw jutäna.
He still drinks, but it’s okay.	Jupax wali umañ yati, ukampis walikïskiwa.
And he came from here.	Ukat jupax aka chiqat jutäna.
Very nice and unique.	Wali suma ukat jan uñt’atawa.

He’s thankful.	Jupaw yuspärta.
Nothing major needed.	Janiw kuna jachʼa lurañas wakiskiti.
He created the moment out of nothing.	Jupaw uka pachax jan kunat luratayna.
So there was nothing else to do.	Ukatwa janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
But there is a new dawn.	Ukampis mä machaq alwaw utji.
Also, a slice of snowflake.	Ukhamaraki, mä ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
We will do these things soon.	Jankʼakiw ukanak lurañäni.
Or in the morning.	Jan ukajj alwajj.

Tell me what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk yatiyapjjeta.

We will do more of the same.	Jiwasajj jukʼampiw ukham lurañanak lurañäni.
I said that the other night, too.	Nayajj yaqha arumaw ukham sista, ukhamaraki.
That was who he was afraid of.	Ukaw khitis jupar ajjsaräna.
But this is pretty funny.	Ukampis akax wali muspharkañawa.
You really don’t want to go there.	Chiqansa janiw uka chiqar sarañ munktati.
I like that they have a dinner date.	Nayatakix wali askiwa, jupanakax mä manq’añ uruw utji.
I am sure he will love it.	Jupajj wal munasini sasaw nayajj sista.
I don't have that right now.	Jichhajj janiw ukajj utjkituti.

The good thing is, he loved this.	Ukax wali askiwa, jupax akax munasïna.
And he couldn’t tell her.	Ukat janiw jupar yatiyañ puedkänti.
It’s a bit hard though.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amawa ukampis.
But it was good for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I don't want to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurañ munkti.
He had a thing about it.	Jupajj uka toqet mä kunaw utjäna.
And, well .	Ukat, wali .
Now I understand.	Jichhajj amuyasta.
But the issue is an important one.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj wali wakiskiriwa.
Much more difficult.	Walja juk’ampi ch’amawa.
I don’t remember where.	Janiw kawkirus amtaskti.
He refused again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jan iyaw säna.
It was long before all of this happened.	Taqe ukanakajj janïr paskäna ukhaw nayrajj pasäna.
Beer and wine, at least.	Cerveza ukat vino, mä juk’a.
I am glad to still see him.	Jupar wali uñjasajj wal kusista.
Mary was in love with him.	Mariajj wal munasïna.
But there's nothing better about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqit jukʼamp sum lurañax utjkiti.
I want it done soon.	Nayax jank’akiw lurasiñap munta.
This is what you’re doing.	Akax kunatix jumax luraskta ukawa.
But that is not a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw wali askïkiti.
There was no problem there.	Ukanjja janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He especially saw the air.	Jupajj jukʼampiw thaya uñjäna.
He can do what is impossible.	Kuntï jan lurañjamäki uk Jupajj luraspawa.
But I just can't figure out how.	Ukampis nayax janiw kunjamsa uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
We’ve had a lot of trouble.	Jiwasax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
People seemed interested.	Jaqinakax wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
It's a nice thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj walikïskiwa.
I don’t know the language here.	Nayax janiw akan aru yatkti.
He actually did that.	Chiqpachansa ukham luratayna.
But it’s not as good as you think.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamarjam askïkiti.
There’s a part of me that’s interesting to you.	Nayan mä chiqaw utji, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I really appreciate everyone.	Chiqpachansa taqiniruw walpun yuspärta.
Who knows what could have gone wrong .	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk khitis yati .
And yes, it wasn’t.	Ukat jïsa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
That means both.	Ukajj panpachaniw sañ muni.
Of course no one noticed.	Chiqansa janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
He really cares for her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar sum uñji.

A lovely day.	Mä munat uru.
John had a particularly bad time.	Juanajj jukʼampiw jan wali tiempon jikjjatasïna.
Something is really happening.	Kunas chiqpachapunix utji.
But he finally agreed.	Ukampis qhepatjja, iyaw sänwa.
As I am doing now.	Kunjamtï jichhajj luraskta ukhama.
But it stayed longer than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow qheparäna.
He’s not available at the moment.	Jupax janiw jichha pachanx utjkiti.
This can be very useful if you feel you need it.	Ukax wali askïspawa, jumatix ukax wakisispati sasin amuyasta ukhaxa.
That was all there was.	Ukajj taqeniw utjäna.
But most of all, it is amazing.	Ukampis taqe kunat sipansa wali muspharkañawa.
I think the bigger the better.	Nayax amuyta juk’amp jach’a ukax juk’amp askiwa.
The reason was not immediately apparent.	Kunatsa ukham luräna ukajj janiw jankʼak amuyaskänti.
There was more to it.	Ukajj jukʼampiw utjäna.
That is the part he likes best.	Uka chiqaw juparux jukʼamp gusti.
I gave him the word.	Nayaw jupar arunak churta.

A kind of snowflake.	Mä kasta ch’uqi.
Actually, it’s better for me there.	Chiqansa, ukanx nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.
I feel sad about that.	Uka tuqitxa llakitaw jikxatastxa.
There was a big heart there.	Ukanx mä jach’a chuymaw utjäna.
And he needed to do that.	Ukat jupajj ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
And this is what he did.	Ukat aka lurawayi.
No, it was different.	Janiwa, yaqha ukhamänwa.
There are more hours in the day.	Uka urux juk’amp horanakaw utji.
Don’t forget about these.	Ukanakat jan armasimti.
He’ll have something for you.	Jupax jumatakix kunas utjani.
He wanted to sleep soundly.	Jupajj wali sumwa ikiñ munäna.
I’m sure he doesn’t mean it.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax janiw uk sañ munkiti.

It’s more or less common.	Ukax juk’amp jan ukax juk’amp uñt’atawa.
And he never quite knew how.	Ukat kunjamsa uk janipuniw sum yatkänti.
One of the best of course.	Maynix wali askiwa chiqpachansa.
He cannot do that himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw ukham lurkaspati.
I want to let time pass.	Nayax tiempo pasañap jaytañ munta.
He’s somewhere.	Jupax kawkhans utji.
So I wasn't sure what I really meant.	Ukhamajj janiw kuntï cheqpachapun sañ munkta uk sum yatkayätti.
And after that, .	Ukat uka qhepatjja, .
There is nowhere to go.	Janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkiti.

So that's not the case.	Ukhamajj ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Warm and kind of weird.	Junt’u ukat mä kasta muspharkañ.

There was never any problem with that.	Janipuniw uka toqet kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.

He didn't understand why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw amuykänti.
It worked well for a long time.	Wali jaya tiempow sum irnaqäna.

He has nothing so far.	Jupajj jichhakamajj janiw kunas utjkiti.

But, it’s still important.	Ukampis, wali wakiskiriwa.
I don't think it will be a problem now.	Jichhax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw amuyta.
He rubbed his nose.	Jupax nayrax ch’allxtayäna.
There is nothing else to do.	Janiw kuna yaqha lurañas utjkiti.
So there was no problem.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
This guy only sees what he wants to see.	Aka waynax kuntix uñjañ munki ukakiw uñji.

He really went back on it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet kuttʼjjäna.

Honestly, it worked lovely.	Chiqpachansa, ukax munasiñampiw irnaqäna.

I’ve done that little bit.	Nayax uka jisk’a lurawayta.

About what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uka toqetwa.
And he didn’t like it here.	Ukat juparux janiw akanx gustkänti.

He was really hungry.	Chiqpachansa manqʼat awtjataw jikxatasïna.
Do these things.	Ukanak luram.

They don’t know any other way.	Jupanakax janiw yaqha tuqit yatipkiti.
But let’s be honest for that.	Ukampis ukatakix chiqapar uñjañäni.
It’s always costly.	Ukax sapa kutiw qullqix utji.
He asked her how she had done it.	Kunjamsa uk lurawayta sasaw jisktʼäna.
We have a week, more or less.	Mä semanaw utjistu, juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
But, this isn’t your case.	Ukampis, janiw akax jumanakan ukhamäkiti.
He saw her as a villain.	Jupajj mä jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa uñjäna.

More than anything, he needed it.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukaruw munasïna.

I want to talk to you.	Nayajj jumamp parlañ munta.
How is that possible?.	¿Kunjamatsa ukajja?.
At the time, he said no.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw sasaw säna.
He hit the first snowflake.	Jupax nayrïr ch’uqi ch’allt’äna.
Or something else needed to be done.	Jan ukajj yaqha lurañaw wakisïna.
He can make things better or worse for me.	Jupaw nayatakejj jukʼamp sum jan ukajj jukʼamp jan walinak luraspa.
Eventually, he remembered his own name.	Qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw sutip amtäna.
I’m so sorry!.	¡Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa!.
It happened to love him.	Jupar munasiñampiw pasäna.
But whatever it takes, it would be worth it.	Ukampis kunas wakisispa, ukajj wali askïspawa.
He doesn't know what to say.	Jupajj janiw kunsa parlañ yatkiti.
They’re awesome for you.	Jupanakax jumatakix wali muspharkañawa.

A happier year.	Mä jukʼamp kusisit mara.
So it's a lot.	Ukhamajj walpun.
A truly amazing day.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ uru.
That’s what you said to him.	Ukhamaw jupar säta.

This is not always the case.	Ukax janiw sapa kutix ukhamäkiti.

You are welcome here.	Jumax akanx wali askiwa.

Now this is very difficult.	Jichhax akax wali ch’amawa.
At the time, he had nothing.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kunas jupajj utjkänti.
They seem to be doable.	Jupanakax lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasi.
He left early one morning.	Mä alwaw wali alwat sarjjäna.
I feel like he has a good heart.	Jupajj suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
You are a fool.	Jumax mä loqhe jaqïtawa.
I really can’t believe it, somehow.	Chiqpachansa janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti, kunjamatsa.
No one should do this alone.	Janiw khitis sapaki uk lurañapäkiti.
Or not entirely nothing.	Jan ukajj janiw taqpach jan kunäkisa.
That is exactly what happened.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
And that was both.	Ukat ukax panpachaniw utjäna.
You’re the only one out there.	Jumax sapakiw ukan jikxatastaxa.

It was very clear.	Wali qhanawa.
And things moved very quickly.	Ukat kunanakas wali jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
In terms of usage, this can be useful.	Uka apnaqañ tuqitxa, ukax wali askïspawa.
They’re good, too.	Jupanakax wali askiwa, ukhamaraki.
But the man didn't do anything.	Ukampis uka jaqejj janiw kuns lurkänti.
Blood, a lot of blood.	Wila, walja wila.
He was constantly looking at her.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
He is the only one who knows.	Jupa sapakiw uk yati.
I didn't want him here.	Janiw nayajj jupar akan munkayätti.

Of course, you should.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañamawa.

He knows exactly what to do.	Kun lurañas uk sum yati.
There’s nothing out there.	Janiw kunas uka chiqanx utjkiti.
So you should never do that.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti.
He saw everything in her.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupar uñjäna.
Everything seemed interesting, interesting.	Taqi kunas wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa, wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But you are more important.	Ukampis jumajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
I think this is really cool.	Nayax amuyta akax chiqpachans wali sumawa.
But the house.	Ukampis uka uta.
He lived a very long time.	Wali jaya tiempow jakasïna.
He loved cigarettes.	Jupajj cigarro wal munäna.
After that, I didn't want to know any more.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkayätti.
Never had a chance at all.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa mä oportunidad utjkänti.
It’s not always in a specific location.	Janiw sapa kutix mä uñt’at chiqan utjkiti.
What is the best of each.	Kunas sapa maynix wali askïspa.
She is a woman to me.	Jupax nayatakix warmiwa.
He didn't say it himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw siskänti.
He didn't want to talk about it now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj uka toqet parlañ munkänti.
I knew exactly how it would turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk sum yatiyäta.
And maybe we should.	Ukat inas jiwasajj ukham lurañasa.
No one knows for sure how long.	Qhawqha tiempos uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
There’s a lot of poison.	Ukanx wali sumawa.
I had to do something kind of every day.	Sapa uru mä kasta lurañaw wakisïna.
I really appreciate all of this.	Chiqpachansa taqi ukanak luratapat wali askit uñjta.
Cold, it’s a cold snowflake.	Thaya, ukaxa thaya ch’uqi satawa.
You can only do it again once.	Mä kutikiw wasitat lurañax wakisispa.
There is no better way to do it.	Janiw jukʼamp suma lurañajj utjkiti.
She was afraid something like that would happen today.	Jichhürunakan ukham kunas pasaspa sasaw ajjsaräna.
But he’s really nice.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
I can't figure out how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
He didn't do much new at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw walja machaq lurañanak lurkänti.
He still refuses to leave school.	Jupax waliw yatiqañ uta jaytañ jan munkiti.
I want to do something for you.	Nayax jumatakix kuns lurañ munta.
I have no idea what’s going on during the day.	Kunas urux pasaski ukx janiw amuykti.
I think that’s a necessity.	Nayatakix ukax mä wakiskiriwa.
She is a lovely woman.	Jupax wali munat warmiwa.
We really need to do something.	Chiqpachansa kunsa lurañasa.
He rocked the house.	Jupax uta ch’allxtayäna.
Nice to see you again.	Jumanakar wasitat uñjasajj wal kusista.
Of course, not at all.	Chiqansa, janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
A beautiful, out-of-nowhere place.	Mä suma, jan kawkhansa chiqa.
Here it is again, almost.	Akax wasitatwa, niya.
Of course he didn’t notice.	Chiqansa jupax janiw amuyaskänti.

He was really surprised.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw muspharäna.
So he didn't know exactly.	Ukhamajj janiw sum yatkänti.
There is no reason to rush it.	Janiw kuna razonas jankʼak lurañatakejj utjkiti.
The weirder it is, the better.	Ukax juk’amp muspharkañawa, juk’amp askiwa.
I have several of these.	Nayax walja ukanakaw utjitu.
But he doesn’t do that.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
Fortunately, none of this happens.	Wali askiwa, janiw ukanak lurañax utjkiti.
He decides for himself.	Jupa pachpaw kunsa amti.
He never said it.	Janipuniw uk arskänti.
This year could be a bad year.	Jichha marax mä jan wali maraw utjaspa.
I understood how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk amuyayäta.
There’s speed and power.	Ukanx jank’akiw ukat ch’amaw utji.
The weather is beautiful.	Uka pachax wali sumawa.
This is what we did here.	Akax kuntix akan lurapkta ukawa.
He was such a bad guy.	Jupajj ukham jan wali jaqënwa.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Janiwa, janiw walïkiti.
But how exactly?.	Ukampis ¿kunjamsa cheqapuni?.
All of this seems doable.	Taqi ukanakax lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
He's waiting for you.	Jupaw jumar suyt'aski.
But I don't know what the problem is.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk janiw yatkti.
Then the man spoke again.	Ukat uka jaqejj wasitatwa parläna.
Either that or nothing.	Ukax jan ukax janiw kunas.
It’s not about these things.	Janiw ukanak tuqitxa ukhamäkiti.
I don’t have any money.	Nayax janiw kuna qullqis utjkituti.
But he couldn't tell her.	Ukampis janiw uk yatiyañ puedkänti.
Also, worse.	Ukhamaraki, juk’ampi jan wali.
Try to go somewhere bigger.	Jachʼa cheqar sarañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
This took three days.	Ukatakejj kimsa uruw pasäna.
That is what we need to do today.	Jichhürunakanxa ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Of course, it’s silent.	Chiqansa, ukax amukiw.
But, that’s all he told me.	Ukampis, ukakiw jupax sitäna.
And so things happened.	Ukat ukhamaw kunas pasäna.
The question is irrelevant.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw kunäkisa.
A lot, too.	Walja, ukhamaraki.
The house is quiet and quiet.	Uka utax wali ch’amawa ukat wali ch’amawa.
This is absolutely impossible.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He feels the same way about me.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw nayat amuyasi.
This isn't any better.	Ukax janiw juk'amp askïkiti.
Last night nothing worked.	Qhipa arumax janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
Remove the snowflakes from the snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
About what’s happening now.	Kunas jichhax pasaski uka tuqit.
I’m aware of all the possibilities.	Nayax taqi kunatix utjki ukanakat yatxatasta.
It gave him some time.	Ukaw jupar mä jukʼa tiempo churäna.
So yeah, that's important, he says.	Ukhamajj jïsa, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa, sasaw saraki.
I got this one and.	Nayax akax mä ukat...
This guy knows.	Aka waynax yati.
He thought he was a bad guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
This is always a problem.	Ukax sapa kutiw mä jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
I think he’s still waiting.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali suyt’aski.
And he never will.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkaniti.
You know, it’s quiet here.	Jumax yatisktawa, akanx amukiw jikxatasi.
That’s a lot of fun, isn’t it?.	Ukax wali kusiskañawa, ¿janich ukhamäki?.
How could he do that to her.	Kunjamsa jupar ukham luraspa.
He was like yesterday.	Jupajj kunjamtï qharürojj paskäna ukhamänwa.
It's funny how things can happen.	Kunjamsa kunas pasaspa ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
I think he did better, actually.	Nayax amuyta jupax juk’amp sum luratayna, chiqpachansa.
And man does that feel good.	Ukat jaqix ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
No one, right now, can say.	Janiw khitis, jichhax, sañjamäkiti.
I think that’s pretty clear now.	Nayax amuyta ukax jichhax wali qhanawa.
Let’s take a look at them.	Jupanakar uñjañäni.
That was a week ago.	Ukajj mä semana nayraw pasäna.
He thought he was great.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
He knows what it is.	Jupajj kunas ukajj uk sum yati.
You want to get into it.	Jumax ukaruw mantañ munta.
A small slice of snowflake.	Mä jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Me too, obviously.	Nayax ukhamarakiw, qhanawa.
It can’t be without it.	Janiw jan utjkaspati.
Now he looked very sad.	Jichhax jupax wali llakitaw uñnaqäna.
He never wanted anything.	Janipuniw kunas munkänti.
And he wants to know.	Ukat yatiñwa muni.
It shook her a little.	Mä juk’a ch’allxtayäna.
Instead, he did it himself.	Jan ukasti, jupaw ukham luräna.
He loved you so much.	Jupajj jumar wal munasïna.
That’s not what he likes.	Ukax janiw juparux gustkiti.
Exactly as it says.	Chiqpachansa kunjamtï siski ukhama.
Only what is necessary.	Kunatï wakiski ukakiw wakisi.
I know exactly what he told me.	Kuntï jupajj sitäna uk sum yatta.
I asked him what he wanted to do today.	Jichhürunakan kun lurañsa munki uk jisktʼta.
That’s why it really matters.	Ukatwa chiqpachapuni ukax wakisi.
Now you have to do it.	Jichhax jumax lurañamawa.
I want to give up.	Nayajj jaytañ munta.
He bought the restaurant.	Jupaw uka manqʼañ uta alasïna.
I’m not the only one talking about it.	Janiw naya sapakix uka tuqit arsuñ munkti.
He wants to be proud.	Jupajj jachʼa jachʼa tukuñ muni.
He felt a little better.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sumwa jikjjatasïna.
Anyone can do that here.	Aka chiqanx khitis ukham luraspawa.
I don't plan on buying this again.	Janiw aka mayamp alañ amtkti.
But no one really does.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpachapuni ukham lurkiti.
That’s as good for you as it is for me.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa, kunjamtï nayatakix ukhama.
He politely refused.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jan munkänti.
He decided to do it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk lurañwa amtäna.
That was the best thing for us.	Ukaw jiwasatak wali sumapunïnwa.
He desperately wanted a cigarette.	Jupajj mä cigarro wal munäna.
Maybe, he said.	Inas, sasaw jupajj säna.
What’s great about you?.	¿Kunas jumatakix wali jach’a?.
Definitely worth the money.	Chiqpachansa qullqix wali askiwa.
It is difficult to do, after all.	Uka lurañajj chʼamakiwa, taqe kunat sipansa.
And where can you do that.	Ukat kawkhansa ukanak lurasma.
There won’t be any time.	Janiw kuna pachas utjkaniti.
Now the task was wonderful.	Jichhajj uka lurañajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He never said it at the time.	Janipuniw uka tiempon arskänti.
There was nothing else like it.	Janiw kunas yaqha ukham utjkänti.
He said he doubted it.	Jupax pächastwa sasaw säna.
I don’t see it being used.	Janiw uka apnaqañ uñjkti.

He knew nothing more about it than she did.	Jupajj janiw jupat sipansa uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
These important people will not be there when you need them most.	Uka wali wakiskir jaqenakajj janiw kunapachatï jukʼamp wakiski ukhajj utjkaniti.
I know he doesn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar munaskiti, uk sum yatta.
Now he’s the guy.	Jichhax jupax uka waynawa.
The thing that matters to us.	Kunatï jiwasatak wakiski ukajja.
So he went on his own.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa saräna.
Everything is important to you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
It was a long time before that.	Uka nayrajj walja tiempow pasäna.
It’s weird but it works.	Ukax muspharkañawa ukampis wali askiwa.
Called him a couple of times.	Mä pä kutiw jupar jawsäna.
He told her several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jupar yatiyäna.
I realized this early on.	Nayajj nayratpachaw uk amuyayäta.
I want to be alone.	Naya sapakiw sarnaqañ munta.
So at the time of the .	Ukhamajj uka tiemponjja, .
But that was not the case at the time.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He just goes, goes, goes.	Jupax ukhamakiw saraski, saraski, saraski.
I guess that says something in itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw kuns sañ muni sasaw amuyta.
So I guess maybe yes.	Ukhamajj inas jïsa sasin amuyta.
Or every half hour like that.	Jan ukax sapa chika horaw ukhama.
He just did it right away.	Jupajj ukhamakiw uk luräna.
People don’t know about this beautiful country.	Jaqinakax janiw aka suma markan yatipkiti.
Well, this little one.	Ukhama, aka jisk’a.

He was a very nice guy.	Jupaw wali suma jaqënwa.

Well, no, it wasn’t.	Ukhama, janiwa, janiwa ukhamäkänti.
You know you never had to.	Janipuniw ukham lurañax wakiskänti, uk jumax yatisktawa.
To do this, you need to do two things.	Uk lurañatakix pä lurañaw wakisi.

I mean everything is like that.	Nayax taqi kunas ukhamawa sañ munta.
Please, let me know in advance.	Mä juk’a, nayraqat yatiyapxita.

He was not ignorant of it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet jan sum yatkänti.
He doesn't think he can do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykiti.
Which he refused.	Ukajj jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
I’m just there for the ride.	Nayax uka kayuk sarañatakix ukhamakiw jikxatastxa.

You need help.	Jumaw yanaptʼa munasma.
Above all this is very important.	Taqi kunat sipansa ukax wali wakiskiriwa.

But he didn't say no.	Ukampis janiw janiw siskänti.
I want that eye.	Nayax uka nayra munta.
Everyone really has something.	Chiqpachansa taqiniw kunas utji.

The money felt good.	Qullqix wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
He felt very sad about her.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jupat amuyasïna.
He obviously didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
You don’t want anything to do with him.	Janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munktati.
It will be faster.	Ukax juk’amp jank’akiw utjani.
After that, I didn't do it in any other film.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw yaqha película ukan lurkti.
It’s always money, you can never do anything about it.	Sapa kutiw qullqix utji, janipuniw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
He kind of knew that.	Jupax mä juk’a uk yatïna.
The way it actually works is quite the opposite.	Kunjamtï cheqpachapun luraski ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want to go, everywhere.	Nayax sarañ munta, taqi chiqan.
Yes, that would be really interesting.	Jïsa, ukax chiqpachapuniw wali askïspa.

That’s the way it is everywhere.	Ukhamaw taqi chiqan utji.

He said something to himself.	Jupa pachpaw kuns arsüna.
And then what happens to him .	Ukat uka qhepatjja, kunas jupat pasani .

We don’t have that kind of money.	Jiwasax janiw ukham qullqix utjkiti.
So that's not what's going on.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas pasaski ukajj ukhamäkiti.
I’m not like that at all.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkti.
I really enjoyed doing this the next day.	Chiqpachansa, uka lurañax qhipürux wali askiwa.
One word, two words, no more.	Mä aru, pä aru, janiw juk’ampi.
He shouldn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurañapäkiti.
I have heard the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw istʼta.
Mary answered the phone.	Mariajj uka telefonot jawsäna.
Which I completely agree with.	Ukjja, nayajj taqe chuymaw iyaw sista.

There’s something about him.	Jupat kunas utji.

And it actually works.	Ukat chiqpachansa walikïskiwa.
I didn’t do well that night.	Uka arumax janiw sum lurkti.
I happened to agree.	Nayax iyaw sasaw pasäna.
I think this is pretty cool.	Nayax amuyta akax wali sumawa.
Well, that's not the case right now.	Ukhamajj janiw jichhajj ukhamäkiti.
He did nothing particularly fascinating.	Jupajj janiw kunsa wali muspharkañ lurkänti.
It’s really exciting.	Chiqpachansa, wali kusiskañawa.
It seemed almost impossible.	Niya jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
He was the only one who told me anything.	Jupa sapakiw kuns yatiyäna.
In this respect, he loved it.	Uka tuqitxa, jupax walpun munasïna.
Very recently, actually.	Wali jichhakiw, chiqpachansa.
You are a coward.	Jumax mä axsarkañ jaqïtawa.
But in many ways he was a man.	Ukampis walja toqet jaqejj ukhamänwa.
That’s everyone.	Ukax taqiniw.
And he can’t help but think he doesn’t.	Ukat jupax janiw kuns lurkaspati, jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
It’s not really good.	Janiw chiqpachapunix askïkiti.
He’s leaving today.	Jupax jichhüruw sarxani.
It seems doable.	Ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
Well, it’s kind of cool.	Ukhama, mä juk’a thaya.
This has been a wonderful year.	Akax wali suma maraw utjawayi.
And some money.	Ukat mä qhawqha qullqi.
I don’t care, let’s see.	Nayax janiw kuns lurkti, uñjañäni.

I have one more thing to do.	Nayax mä juk’amp lurañaw utjitu.
The more you do, the more you want about it.	Jukʼamp lurasma ukhajja, jukʼampiw uka toqet munta.
Tell me what it is.	Kunas uk yatiyapxita.
There can be no time.	Janiw pachax utjkaspati.
He said whenever.	Jupax kunapachas sänwa.
It wasn’t, you know.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, jumax yatisktawa.
He died several hours later.	Jupajj walja horanak qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
The money to do so is not financially available.	Ukham lurañatakix qullqix janiw qullqi tuqit utjkiti.
Somehow that doesn’t matter.	Kunjamatsa ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Everyone knows it.	Taqinipuniw yatipxi.
It was long and beautiful.	Ukajj wali jaya ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
He can do that.	Jupajj ukham luraspawa.
He gave me the word.	Jupaw uka aru churitu.
Tell me that again .	Uk wasitat yatiyapjjeta .
He spoke quietly on the phone.	Jupajj telefonot amukiw parläna.
Now tell me what to do.	Jichhax kuns lurañax uk yatiyapxita.
I feel sad.	Llakitaw jikjjatasta.
Or anyone really.	Jan ukax khitis chiqpachansa.
Eventually, after that .	Qhepatjja, uka qhepatjja .
So what is the problem here.	Ukhamajj kuna jan waltʼäwis akan utji.
One of our .	Maynix jiwasan .
He was so happy, so happy.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I did that to him.	Nayaw jupar ukham lurawayta.
Maybe he can build a house somewhere.	Inas kawkhans mä uta luraspa.
He’s the one who’s done it all.	Jupaw taqe kun lurawayi.
I knew what would happen.	Kunas ukham pasani uk sum yatiyäta.
There’s no big secret.	Janiw kuna jach’a jamasat utjkiti.
There was no one about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw khitis utjkänti.
I obviously don’t.	Nayax qhanaw jan ukham lurkti.
A cold, rainy wind.	Mä thaya, jallu thaya.
This happened before.	Ukax nayraw pasäna.
And he decided to do it again.	Ukat wasitatwa uk lurañ amtäna.
He did something on his own.	Jupa pachpaw kuns luratayna.
Now this is amazing.	Jichhax akax muspharkañawa.
It’s really important today.	Chiqpachansa jichhürunakanxa wali wakiskiriwa.
There’s no time when you can’t do that.	Janiw kuna pachas jan ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He’s in such a bad mood.	Jupax ukham jan walin jikxatasi.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ukampis janiw kunas wakiskiti.
This is a woman .	Akax mä warmiwa .
I thanked him for it.	Nayajj jupar yuspärta.
I'm sorry .	Nayax wali askiwa .
He gave her a letter.	Jupajj mä carta churäna.
Or actually it is.	Jan ukax chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
But there is a problem.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utji.
They are better than me.	Jupanakajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Let’s do it again!.	¡Jichhax wasitat lurañäni!.
I’m sorry, now.	Nayax llakistwa, jichhax.
Of course, I can't do any of that right now.	Chiqansa, janiw jichhax kunas ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
He came here every day.	Jupax sapa uruw akan jutäna.
He played the piano.	Jupajj piano tocañ yatïna.
Who can do it faster.	Khitis jukʼamp jankʼak luraspa.
But he knew I could never do that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurirjamäkti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I always come through.	Nayax sapa kutiw uka tuqit jutta.
It was perfect on a cold day.	Mä thaya urux wali sumapunïnwa.
He talks a lot.	Jupax walpun arsu.
But he felt that these were the right things to do.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj walikïskiwa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Or rather, it was.	Jan ukajj, ukhamänwa.
He doesn’t know anyone.	Jupax janiw khitis yatkiti.
We have a very early morning.	Jiwasax mä wali alwaw utjistu.
I am not doing this to help you.	Janiw jumanakar yanaptʼañatakejj ukham lurkti.
He made up his mind immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kunsa lurani uk amtäna.
And he said he wanted to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañ munta sasaw säna.
One person is important.	Mä jaqix wali wakiskiriwa.
He built his own house.	Jupa pachpaw utap luratayna.
These may be useful to you.	Ukanakax jumatakix wali askïspawa.
That’s exactly what he is.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax.
But he can’t do it alone.	Ukampis janiw sapakix uk lurkaspati.
I’m going out to another world.	Nayax yaqha pacharuw mistuñ munta.
He had no idea how long it would take.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani uk janiw amuykänti.
A great old car.	Mä jach’a nayra auto.
But that takes some time.	Ukampis ukatakix mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.
I decided to take a chance.	Nayax mä ch’am apsuñ amtawayta.
It was almost too good to be true.	Niya wali sumapunïnwa.
She is so friendly and warm and loving.	Jupajj wali suma jaqewa ukat wali munasiñampiw uñji ukat wali munasiñampiw uñji.
But he is trying hard.	Ukampis jupajj wal chʼamachasiski.
I didn't seem to want it.	Nayajj janis munkaspa ukhamänwa.
I didn’t expect this of myself.	Janiw naya pachpat uk suykayätti.
He went very hard.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw saräna.
And yes, it is.	Ukat jïsa, ukhamawa.
Don’t forget to take them off.	Janiw jupanakar apsuñ armasimti.
He looks like twenty.	Jupax pä tunk ukham uñtatawa.
That is impossible to do.	Ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
We went to his place.	Jupan utjki ukaruw sarapjjta.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasta.
I think he wanted to see what would happen.	Kunas pasani uk uñjañ munäna sasaw amuyta.
I’m feeling hungry.	Nayax manq’at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
He hasn’t done this before.	Jupax janiw nayrax ukham lurkiti.
You made me feel better.	Jumaw nayar sum jikjjatasta.
Lots of all kinds.	Walja taqi kasta.
I want to live in the moment.	Nayax uka pachan jakañ munta.
He was perfect for that sort of thing.	Jupajj uka kasta lurañatakejj wali sumapunïnwa.
The real us.	Chiqpach jiwasax.
He doesn’t know where he’s going next.	Jupax janiw kawkirus jutïrin sarañapa uk yatkiti.
I guess now nobody knows.	Nayax amuyta jichhax janiw khitis yatkiti.
Yes, it was that long.	Jïsa, ukham jaya tiempow pasäna.
I can't do that right now.	Janiw jichhajj ukham lurirjamäkti.
So he didn't agree.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj iyaw siskänti.
It’s quieter here.	Aka chiqanx juk’amp amukiw jikxatasi.
It’s really very unusual.	Chiqpachansa wali jan uñt’atawa.
I didn’t tell them how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw jupanakar siskti.
Tomorrow is good for me.	Qhipürux nayatakix wali askiwa.
How do you mean it? 	¿Kunjamsa jumajj sañ munta?
John is a mischievous young man.	Juanajj jan wali lurir waynawa.
That didn't matter, she decided.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
We still have three weeks.	Wali kimsa semanaw utjistu.
He could not have done a single thing to help me.	Jupajj janiw mä sapa kunsa nayar yanaptʼañatakejj lurkaspänti.
We’ll see him tomorrow.	Qharüruw jupar uñjañäni.
They don’t have half the food.	Jupanakax janiw chikat manq’añax utjkiti.
This happened after a while.	Ukajj mä qhepatwa pasäna.
I think it can do that.	Ukham luraspa sasaw amuyta.
And, it feels really good.	Ukat, chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Still needs to be done, of course.	Wali lurañaw wakisi, chiqpachansa.
You are better than that.	Jumax ukat sipansa jukʼamp suma jaqïtawa.
And he felt that way.	Ukat jupax ukham amuyasïna.
There’s this one place.	Ukanx aka mä chiqaw utji.

No one had any idea what was coming next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw khitis amuykänti.
Or not, not at all.	Jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have no idea what he was talking about.	Kuna tuqitsa uka tuqit parläna uk janiw amuykti.
I want to use it alone.	Naya sapakiw apnaqañ munta.
It was really big and spacious.	Chiqpachansa jachʼa ukat jachʼa ukhamänwa.
A little snowflake.	Mä jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I don’t know if that’s good or not.	Nayax janiw ukax askïkiti janicha uk yatkti.
After that, you will have to do your homework.	Uka qhepatjja, tareanak lurañaw wakisini.
It knocked the air out of him.	Jupat thaya ch’allt’äna.
Of course, there is absolutely no time for that.	Chiqansa, ukatakix janiw kuna pachas tiempox utjkiti.
It’s time to move.	Yaqha chiqar sarxañ pachaw purini.
He agreed again.	Jupajj wasitatwa iyaw säna.
He gave her advice.	Jupaw jupar ewjjtʼäna.
But someone else .	Ukampis yaqha jaqejj .
Someone is the wrong person for you.	Maynix jumatakix jan wali jaqiwa.
All of these are in good shape.	Taqi ukanakax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Here and everywhere.	Aka chiqan ukat taqi chiqan.
I don’t know anything about it, really.	Nayax janiw kuns uka tuqit yatkti, chiqpachansa.
I was really devastated.	Chiqpachansa wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I actually felt good.	Chiqansa, wali sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
That is not good for you.	Ukajj jumatakejj jan walïkiti.
The same rock.	Uka pachpa qala.
I know a thing or two.	Mä jan ukajj pä kunsa yattwa.
Of course, that had nothing to do with it.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
This is not entirely bad.	Ukajj janiw taqpach jan walïkiti.
That is simply not the case today.	Ukajj jichhürunakan janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s a great guy.	Jupax mä jach’a waynawa.
We’ll do it again.	Jiwasax wasitat lurañäni.
I always want to come here.	Sapa kutiw akan jutañ munta.
In fact, he told her exactly what to do.	Chiqansa, kunsa lurañapa uk sumwa jupar yatiyäna.
That what he says will do.	Uka kuntix jupax siski ukax lurañapawa.
But he didn't say that at all.	Ukampis janiw kunjamatsa ukham siskänti.
It happened and it happened fast.	Ukaw pasäna ukat jankʼakiw pasäna.
Either that or there was no time.	Uka jan ukajj janiw tiempojj utjkänti.
It happened again, and again.	Ukax wasitatwa pasäna, ukat wasitatwa pasäna.
Really good as well.	Chiqpachansa wali suma ukhamaraki.
Always there, rarely seen.	Sapa kutiw ukanx utji, juk’akiw uñjasi.
And he didn't like it before that.	Ukat uka nayrajj janiw jupar gustkänti.
Little went too far.	Juk’akiw sinti jaya saräna.
There really was no reason.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
I’m anxiously waiting.	Nayax wali llakitaw suyt’askta.
I am so happy to see that.	Uk uñjasajj wal kusista.
I think he’s good, too.	Nayax jupax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta, ukhamaraki.
We all don’t like anything.	Taqinipuniw janiw kunas jiwasatak askïkiti.
It will arrive in the morning.	Ukajj wali alwaw purini.
I know he was asleep.	Jupajj ikiskäna uk sum yatta.
He understood her very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupar sum amuyäna.
Nothing much, maybe.	Janiw kunas sinti utjkiti, inas.
I really want to help him with it.	Chiqpachansa nayax juparux uka tuqit yanaptʼañ munta.
He’s such a lovely person.	Jupax ukham munat jaqiwa.
Instead, it does nothing to cause harm.	Jan ukasti, jan walinak lurañatakix janiw kuns lurkiti.
In a moment, he understands everything.	Mä jukʼa tiemponjja, taqe kunwa amuyi.
And a great one, too.	Ukat mä jach’a, ukhamaraki.
It’s almost as if no one knows about this place.	Niya janis khitis aka chiqat yatkaspa ukhamawa.
He’d seen her before, and he’d seen her recently.	Jupax nayraw jupar uñjäna, ukat jichhakiw uñjäna.
He took it out and admired it.	Ukat apsüna ukat wali askit uñjäna.
When he left.	Jupajj sarjjäna ukhajja.
Except he knew it wasn’t.	Jan ukasti jupax janiw ukhamäkiti uk yatïna.
It does some work.	Mä qhawqha lurañanak luraski.
I think he’s in a good place.	Nayax amuyta jupax mä suma chiqan jikxatasi.
That’s not exactly what you want.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapunix kuntix jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't really need to.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
What happened next is amazing.	Kunatï uka qhepat paskäna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
What if he can’t talk.	¿Kunas jupax jan parlañ yatkaspa ukhaxa.
He walked a little bit more.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi sarnaqäna.
One can do these things quickly.	Mä jaqejj jankʼakiw ukanak luraspa.
Last more than anything else.	Taqi kunat sipansa qhipa juk’ampi.
But don't give up on yourself.	Ukampis janiw juma pachpajj jaytañamäkiti.
Give me a week.	Mä semanaw churitu.
I don’t always get that chance.	Nayax janiw sapa kutix uka ch’am jikxatkti.
I just want to get out.	Nayax ukhamakiw mistuñ munta.
I have at least one more.	Nayajj mä jukʼampiw utjitu.
He lived in the mansion for ten years.	Jupajj tunka maranakaw uka jachʼa utan jakasïna.
He never said no.	Janipuniw janiw sasaw siskänti.
I never once thought of leaving.	Janipuniw mä kutis sarxañ amtkti.
I don't think that's a good thing.	Nayatakejj ukajj janiw walïkiti.
I don't remember much about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet wal amtaskti.
I love what you do.	Nayax kunanaktï lurapkta ukanakax walpun munasta.
There can be no amount of money.	Janiw mä qullqix utjkaspati.
That’s not a yes.	Ukax janiw mä jïsa sañ munkiti.
But this is strange.	Ukampis akax muspharkañawa.
I really don’t know for sure.	Chiqpachansa janiw sum yatkti.
And really, that doesn’t matter.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
He asked me if everything was alright.	Jupajj taqe kunas walikïskiti janicha sasaw jisktʼitäna.
He just knew that.	Jupax ukhamakiw yatïna.
Actually, that’s what I like.	Chiqansa, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
You know, it takes a lot of time.	Jumax yatisktawa, walja tiempow pasaski.
When did I ask him.	Kunapachas jupar jisktʼta.
He said he had none.	Jupax janiw kunas utjkituti sasaw säna.
No one seems to know anything about it.	Janis khitis uka toqet kuns yatkaspa ukhamawa.

It’s obviously there.	Ukax qhanaw ukanx utji.
All because of what he did.	Taqe ukanakajj kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukatwa.
It doesn’t have to do a lot of work.	Janiw walja lurañanak lurañapäkiti.
He would never do it again.	Jupajj janipuniw mayampsa uk lurkaspänti.
Recently, however, there has been one crisis after another.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, jichhakiw mä jan waltʼäwit mä jan waltʼäwejj utjawayi.
He was very aware of who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk wal sum amuyäna.

Don’t stop walking.	Janiw sarnaqañ jaytañamäkiti.
And it doesn’t work very well.	Ukat janiw sinti sum irnaqkiti.
It was there for two hours.	Pä horaw ukan utjäna.
I want to speak for myself.	Naya pachpaw arsuñ munta.
I think you really like him.	Nayax juparux chiqpachapuniw munasma sasaw amuyta.
And there is nothing wrong with either.	Ukat janiw kunas uka pä tuqit jan walïkiti.
He was gone for a week.	Jupajj mä semanaw sarjjäna.
I know everything about you.	Nayajj jumanakat taqe kunwa yatta.
But something had to be done.	Ukampis kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
He always wants the ball.	Jupax sapa kutiw pelot munaraki.
Of course, no one is.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.
Never leave her alone again.	Janiw mayampsa sapak jaytañamäkiti.

I look forward to seeing him everyday.	Jupar sapa uru uñjañ wal suyaskta.
I hope to see you there soon.	Ukan jankʼak uñjañ suyaskta.
That’s not enough for that.	Ukax janiw ukatakix wakiskiti.
That was the question that morning.	Uka alwaw uka jisktʼajj utjäna.
But then . . . .	Ukampis uka qhepatjja .
Things happened really fast.	Kunanakas chiqpachansa jankʼakiw pasäna.
You know all about it.	Jumax taqi ukanak yatisktawa.
But not everyone knows.	Ukampis taqeniw janiw yatipkiti.
I’m not saying he won’t.	Janiw nayax jupax janiw sañ munkti.
It’s going to take some time.	Mä juk’a pachaw sarañapa.
I could never do that.	Janipuniw uk lurirjamäkti.
Could this be a problem.	¿Akax kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa.
I thought he was.	Jupajj sasaw amuyayäta.
Breakfast was delicious, dinner even better.	Desayuno ukax wali sumawa, manq’añax juk’amp sumawa.
But now he is very sad.	Ukampis jichhax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
I have no problem with that.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Someone said thirty.	Maynix kimsa tunka sasaw säna.
It just gets worse.	Ukajj jukʼamp jan walikïskiwa.
Because it can’t be done.	Kunatix janiw lurañjamäkiti.
I'd rather do it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurañajj jukʼamp askejja.
Cold and warm.	Thaya ukat junt’u.
He cared for her with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar uñjäna.
But not everything he says is wrong.	Ukampis janiw taqe kuntï siski ukajj jan walïkiti.
But, no, not really.	Ukampis, janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa.
One speaks one language, the other another.	Maynix mä aru arsu, maynix yaqha arsu.
Thankfully, he did.	Jupajj ukham luräna, ukajj walpun yuspärta.
It happened last night.	Ukajj qhepa arumaw pasäna.
But a foreigner may not know so well.	Ukampis yaqha markankir jaqejj inas jan ukham sum yatkchiti.
I don’t need anything from me.	Janiw kunas nayat munaskiti.
I just came up with it.	Jichhakiw uka tuqitxa jutta.
He knew now that he would love it.	Jupajj wal munasini uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
He was staring at the boy.	Jupajj uka waynaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
I thought that was enough for me.	Nayatakejj ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
All of these things were understood.	Taqe ukanakaw amuyasïna.
He wanted me, he knew.	Jupajj nayaruw munäna, uk sum yatïna.

Yeah, someone knows that .	Jïsa, mayniw uk yati .
It happened only once.	Mä kutikiw pasäna.
But then it happened again.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa pasäna.
I’ve said it all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw uk arsuwayta.
There will be time for that later.	Ukatakejj qhepatwa tiempojj utjani.

I told him exactly what I wanted.	Kuntï munkta ukjja, cheqapuniw jupar yatiyäta.
That’s because it’s not.	Ukax kunatix janiw ukhamäkiti.
It worked fine for a while.	Mä juk’a pachax wali sum irnaqäna.
Other than that, it doesn’t matter to you.	Yaqha tuqitxa, janiw jumatakix kunäkisa.
Couldn’t take his eyes off it.	Janiw nayranakap ukat apsuñ puedkänti.
But now he was still happy.	Ukampis jichhajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He thought these were really important.	Ukanakax chiqpachansa wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyäna.
I 'm sure	Nayax yatxatwa .
He arrived early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat purinïna.
Now I know the truth.	Jichhajj kunatï cheqäki uk yattwa.
But I have no choice.	Ukampis nayajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.

As is so often the case.	Kunjamtï walja kuti luraski ukhama.
I’ve said this once before.	Nayax nayrax mä kutiw ukham sista.
I know that’s important.	Nayax yattwa ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
A brother of	Mä jilatajj .
He lives with us.	Jupajj jiwasamp chikaw jakasi.
He never said no to anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus janiw siskänti.
I’ve never done that before, you know.	Nayax janipuniw nayrax ukham lurkti, jumax yatisktawa.
I think it’s stunningly beautiful to some extent.	Nayatakix mä juk’a pachax wali muspharkañ sumawa.
There is also a.	Ukhamaraki, mä...

He refused to give it to them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar churañ munkänti.
He wanted to be able to sleep .	Jupajj ikiñ yatiñwa munäna .
A distant nothing.	Mä jaya jan kunas.

But he was still alone.	Ukampis jupajj wali sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
But you weren't like that.	Ukampis jumajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Or a lot bigger.	Jan ukax walja jach’a.
I really hoped it would.	Chiqpachansa, ukham lurañapatakiw suykayäta.
He said he never liked me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayar gustkituti sasaw säna.
I knew it was pretty good.	Nayajj wali sumwa yatiyäta.
I think it’s more obvious.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juk’amp qhanawa.
And no one else would.	Ukat janiw khitis ukham lurkaspänti.
Everything was clear.	Taqi kunas qhanaw amuyasïna.
He worked in a day school for a few years.	Mä qawqha maranakaw mä uru yatiqañ utan irnaqäna.
Now you really need to do something about this.	Jichhax chiqpachapuniw aka tuqitx kuns lurañama.
You’re the one.	Jumax’ sasaw säna.
He does this every year.	Jupajj sapa maraw uk luri.

He sat up, but said no more.	Jupajj qontʼasïna, ukampis janiw jukʼamp arskänti.
At the time, he didn't want to know about it.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw jupajj uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
It’s very common and popular.	Ukax wali uñt’atawa ukat wali uñt’atawa.
He talked about it a lot.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun parläna.
Like nothing matters.	Kunjamtï jan kunas wakiski ukhama.
You can do better.	Jumajj jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
He loved it, loved it.	Jupajj walpun munasïna, walpun munasïna.
He didn’t say anything later.	Qhipharux janiw kuns arskänti.
No no no no no no .	Janiwa janiwa janiwa janiwa janiwa janiwa .
I don’t decide what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa amtkti.

I want to give it up.	Nayax uk jaytañ munta.
I remember it very vividly.	Ukjja wali sumwa amtasta.
He doesn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’s absolutely right about it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqit arsu.
I don't know that for sure.	Nayajj janiw uk sum yatkti.
I know not this time, and the next.	Nayax yattwa jan aka kutix, ukat jutir.
I never expected that.	Janipuniw ukham suykayätti.
He wasn't sure what it was.	Jupajj kunas uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He was very aware of this.	Ukjja jupajj wali sumwa amuyäna.
He could do both.	Jupajj panpachaniw lurañ yatïna.
I can’t stand you thinking that.	Nayax janiw aguantañjamäkiti jumax ukham amuyta.
Let’s see the next sum.	Jutïr suma uñjañäni.
Now, that’s weird.	Jichhax, ukax muspharkañawa.
But it gets to you.	Ukampis jumaruw puri.
More than that, he refused to give himself permission.	Ukat sipansa, janiw jupa pachpajj permiso churañ munkänti.
He looked so good.	Jupajj wali sum uñnaqäna.
He was sleeping very quietly.	Jupax wali amukiw ikiskäna.
It’s not coffee.	Janiw café ukhamäkiti.
You tell me what he is doing.	Jumax kuns luraski uk yatiyapxita.
I’m always curious about this.	Nayax sapa kutiw aka tuqit yatxatañ munta.
Not that I was about to disagree.	Janiw nayajj niyaw jan iyaw sañ munkayätti.
He didn't want to know who he was.	Jupajj janiw khitïnsa uk yatiñ munkänti.
I thought it would be better.	Nayax juk’amp askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
He knew a lot about it.	Jupajj walpun uka toqet yatïna.
What is going on now.	Kunas jichhax saraski.
I think not at the moment.	Nayax amuyta janiw jichha pachanx utjkiti.
And he’s very quiet.	Ukat jupax wali amukiw sarnaqaski.
I want to take leave.	Nayax permiso apsuñ munta.
He doesn’t want anyone.	Jupax janiw khitirus munkiti.
The house is very well located.	Uka utax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Something hit hard.	Kunas wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
A person who is completely unknown.	Mä jaqix taqpach jan uñt’atawa.
He's the one who does it.	Jupajj uk luri.
There was nothing to do about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
There will be more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp lurañaw utjani.
You’re the only one who doesn’t know anything.	Juma sapakiw jan kuns yatkayäta.
I’ve mentioned this twice.	Nayax pä kutiw uka tuqit arsuwayta.
Now he is on his own.	Jichhax jupa pachpaw sarnaqaski.
But this really isn’t good enough.	Ukampis chiqpachansa akax janiw askïkiti.
I promise you, it’s not impossible.	Nayax arsuwayta, janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
Midnight is fine.	Chika arumax wali askiwa.

I don’t think so.	Nayatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was nothing, he told me.	Janiw kunas utjkänti, sasaw sitäna.
Therefore, the whole thing is good.	Ukatwa, taqpach lurañax wali askiwa.
I’ve given up on living.	Nayax jakañ jaytawayta.
But, let me know when.	Ukampis, kuna horasas uk yatiyapjjeta.

He was long gone.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan uka cheqan utjkänti.

It can happen for years.	Walja maranakaw ukham pasaspa.
It's all he can think of.	Ukajj taqe kunatï jupajj amuyki ukawa.
But that does nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns lurkiti.
Yes, it is better.	Jïsa, jukʼamp askiwa.
It’s also very important.	Ukhamaraki wali wakiskiriwa.
That’s really great.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali jach’a.
I like how he did it.	Kunjamsa ukanak lurawayi uk nayatakix wali askiwa.
Let me know when it will be available.	Kunapachas ukax utjani uk yatiyapxita.
In fact, I’m interested in what happens here.	Chiqansa, kunas aka chiqan pasani ukx nayatakix wali askiwa.
It can take a long time.	Walja tiempow pasaspa.
He knows, or thinks he knows, because it makes sense.	Jupax yati, jan ukax yattwa sasaw amuyi, kunatix ukax wali askiwa.
He's a very good guy.	Jupajj wali sum yati.
First time, last time, it doesn’t matter.	Nayrïr kuti, qhipa kuti, janiw kunäkisa.
These were different.	Ukanakajj yaqha ukhamänwa.

But he never was.	Ukampis janipuniw jupajj ukhamäkänti.
After what happened .	Kunatï paskäna uka qhepatjja .
He needs time .	Jupajj tiempow munasi .
He was obviously shaken up.	Jupajj qhanaw chʼalljjtayasïna.
He talked about everything.	Jupaw taqe kunat parläna.
He went to the gym.	Jupajj ukaruw sarjjäna.
He didn't say exactly why.	Kunatsa uk janiw sum siskänti.
I have had that kind of year.	Nayajj ukham maraw jikjjatasta.

Well now someone just did.	Suma jichhax maynix jichhakiw ukham lurawayi.

Beyond that, there was very little.	Ukat sipansa, wali jukʼakiw utjäna.

Too quiet actually.	Sinti amukiw chiqpachansa.

He pulled it off perfectly.	Jupajj wali sumwa apsüna.

But I've done it.	Ukampis nayajj ukham lurawayta.

That's why he knew.	Ukatwa jupajj yatïna.
He pretty much said what he wanted to do.	Jupajj niyaw kuntï lurañ munkäna uk arsüna.
He did this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham luratayna.
He looked really bad now.	Jichhajj cheqapuniw jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham uñnaqäna.
Too far, he told himself.	Sinti jaya, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
They don’t know where it is.	Jupanakax janiw kawkhans uk yatipkiti.

It never matters what anyone says.	Kuntï khitis siskäna ukajj janipuniw kunäkisa.
Well yeah, actually.	Suma jïsa, chiqpachansa.
He was surprised to see it there.	Ukan uñjasajj wal muspharäna.
Two downsides to this.	Pä jan waliw aka tuqitxa.
I still feel strongly about the country.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw uka markat jikxatastxa.
He didn't say anything for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw kuns arskänti.
Still the man didn’t speak.	Wali uka jaqix janiw arskänti.
But no one understands it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk amuykiti.
Maybe it's .	Inas ukajj .
About that, he told himself.	Uka tuqitxa, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
That’s what made him uncomfortable.	Ukaw juparux jan walin uñjäna.
That can definitely happen.	Ukajj cheqapuniw pasaspa.
That means you are.	Ukajj jumaw sañ muni.
I told him he didn’t.	Janiw ukham lurkiti sasaw jupar sista.
We won’t have it any other way.	Jiwasax janiw yaqha tuqitx utjkaniti.
A lot of times it means life in prison.	Walja kutiw carcelan jakañ sañ muni.
I don't know why he thought that.	Kunatsa ukham amuyäna uk janiw yatkti.
There was nothing inside him now.	Jichhajj janiw kunas jupan manqhan utjkänti.
His very nice snowflake.	Jupan wali suma ch’uqi.

For once he knew what he could do.	Mä kutikiw kunsa luraspa uk yatïna.

And that was it, he never did anything.	Ukat ukax ukhamänwa, janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
No one, ever, did that to him like that.	Janiw khitis, janipuniw, ukham jupar ukham lurkänti.

They’re longer, too.	Jupanakax juk’amp jaya, ukhamaraki.

This happened earlier in the morning.	Ukajj nayra alwaw pasäna.

You’re a cruel guy.	Jumax qhuru jaqïtawa.
I wanted to go out again last night.	Nayax qhipa arumax wasitat mistuñ munta.
Don't do that today.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw uk luramti.

It didn't matter how good it felt.	Kunjamsa wali sum jikjjatasïna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
Actually, not really.	Chiqansa, janiw chiqpachansa.
He was so shocked that he didn't say anything.	Jupajj wal muspharäna, janiw kuns arskänti.

Well, three, actually.	Ukhama, kimsa, chiqpachansa.
Well, that wasn't the case for me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.

I wonder who else does.	Khitis yaqha ukham luraski sasaw jisktʼasta.
He didn't do that.	Ukjja janiw jupajj lurkänti.
There is no reason, why you should.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti, kunatsa ukham lurañama.
He didn't want to do that anymore.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañ jukʼamp munkänti.
He asked her to marry him.	Jupampiw casarasiñatak mayïna.
He could never behave like that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham sarnaqañ puedkänti.
He wants to do it for a long time.	Jupajj jaya tiempow uk lurañ muni.

But he doesn't want to do that.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ munkiti.

There’s nothing around it.	Janiw kunas uka jak’an utjkiti.
I’m pretty excited about this.	Nayax aka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
What more could he want? 	¿Kunsa jukʼamp munpachäna?
And he’s passionate about it.	Ukat jupax uka tuqitx wali munasiñampiw uñji.

Or maybe this .	Jan ukajj inas aka .
I can make things out of nothing.	Nayax jan kunat yänak lurasmati.
I understood what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk sum amuyayäta.
And then it doesn't matter.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw kunäkisa.
Which, obviously, is not the case.	Ukax, qhanaw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s that kind of person.	Jupax uka kasta jaqiwa.
He did this for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham luräna.
He feels really good.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasi.

But something good came from all of this.	Ukampis taqe ukanakat mä suma kunaw jutäna.

He looks rough, she tells him.	Jupax qhuru uñnaqaniwa, sasaw juparux säna.

It doesn’t mean that to me.	Janiw nayatakix ukham sañ munkiti.
The first phase, too late.	Nayrïr phaxsinx, wali qhipürux.
He seemed like a fool.	Jupajj mä loqhe jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
Not what he wanted to see.	Janiw kuntï uñjañ munkäna ukhamäkiti.
I don't think it matters.	Nayajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
This is a little weird.	Akax mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
Faster, for one thing.	Juk’amp jaya, mä tuqitxa.
Money is urgently needed.	Qullqix jank’akiw munasispa.
Time, it seemed.	Tiempo, ukhamaw amuyasïna.
He’s the only one who doesn’t want to go.	Jupa sapakiw jan sarañ munkiti.
I know something better awaits.	Kunas jukʼamp sum suytʼaski uk sum yatta.
But that was it for me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
He could not drink.	Jupajj janiw umañ puedkänti.
Of course, he had no choice.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
And, it has been.	Ukat, ukhamarakiw utjawayi.
He didn't do that at the moment.	Jupajj janiw jichha tiempon ukham lurkänti.
I didn’t know it would be anything like that.	Janiw nayax yatkayätti ukax kunas ukham utjani.
He loved to use you.	Jupajj jumar apnaqañ wal munäna.
You almost never want it.	Niya janipuniw ukanak munktati.
I know what it takes to do that.	Ukatakejj kun lurañas wakisi uk sum yatta.
But this guy is doing it on his own.	Ukampis aka waynax jupa pachpaw uk luraski.
No you don’t have to.	Janiwa jumaxa janiwa ukhamäkti.
But there is one more thing to do.	Ukampis mä jukʼamp lurañaw utji.
But it all happened a long time ago.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
But there is more to it.	Ukampis jukʼampiw utji.
I’ve seen a lot of these.	Nayax walja ukanak uñjta.
So it's not a good thing.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj walïkiti.
I never knew when or why.	Kunapachas ni kunatsa uk janipuniw yatkti.
But that's not a bad thing.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jan walïkiti.
It’s a no and a yes.	Ukax janiw ukat jïsa sañ muni.
I want it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk munta.
But, there is no reason.	Ukampis, janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
And so are the people.	Ukat jaqinakax ukhamarakiw.
The only question was how much.	Uka jisktʼajj qhawqha qollqsa ukakiw utjäna.
Every day, you know.	Sapa uru, jumax yatisktawa.
I think he meant this.	Nayax amuyta, jupax akham sañ munäna.
Everything will be fine.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw utjani.
I have seen them many times.	Jupanakar walja kutiw uñjta.
But then he went further.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw uka cheqar sarjjäna.
Smaller is definitely more.	Jisk’a ukax chiqpachapuniw juk’ampi.
Do the right thing.	Suma lurañanak luram.
I, however, could not do it.	Nayajj ukampis janiw lurirjamäkti.
These were the things of the past.	Ukanakaw nayra tiempon utjäna.
It’s so yeah, it’s cool.	Ukax ukhama jïsa, wali sumawa.
In this case, it’s very simple.	Uka tuqitxa, wali ch’amawa.
But he’s a cool guy.	Ukampis jupax wali thaya jaqiwa.
It started out great.	Ukajj wali sumaw qalltäna.
After a while, he succeeds.	Mä jukʼa qhepatjja, jupajj sumwa luri.
In fact, there is really nothing there.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
I don’t want to see it.	Nayax janiw uñjañ munkti.
A large chunk of snow.	Mä jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He always wants in.	Jupax sapa kutiw mantañ muni.
There can be a place for this.	Ukax mä chiqaw utjaspa.
Lots of water, of course.	Walja uma, chiqpachansa.
It worked much better.	Ukajj jukʼamp sumwa irnaqäna.
And, something happened.	Ukat, kunas pasäna.
But that was something else.	Ukampis ukajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
That didn't make sense to me.	Ukajj janiw nayarojj amuykayätti.
And he could do something.	Ukat kuns luraspäna.
If all goes well.	Taqi kunas sum pasaspa ukhaxa.
And let me know how it goes.	Ukat kunjamsa saraski uk yatiyapxita.
Which is not the case.	Kunatsa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he took it out.	Ukat jupajj apsüna.
That’s fine, barely.	Ukax wali askiwa, juk’akiw.
All he needs is a storm.	Kuntï jupajj munki ukakiw mä jachʼa thaya.
Well he doesn’t know how to tell the truth.	Suma jupax janiw kunjams chiqaw sañ yatkiti.
So he left the issue here.	Ukatwa uka jan waltʼäwejj akan jaytawayi.
Once a day or ten times a day.	Mä kuti urun jan ukax tunka kuti urun.
I am extremely excited about this.	Nayax aka tuqitx sinti kusisitaw jikxatastxa.

He was very alert.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw jikjjatasïna.
It was indeed a good night.	Chiqansa, wali suma arumaw utjäna.
But in the past, it was all there.	Ukampis nayra tiemponjja, taqe ukanakaw utjäna.
Of course, I hope not.	Chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suytʼaskta.
Maybe I miss him so much.	Inas nayax jupat walpun llakista.

And you’re a bad person.	Ukat jumax jan wali jaqïtawa.

He knows how you feel.	Jupajj kunjamsa jumajj amuyasta uk sum yati.

But he would never have done that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.
He knew his job.	Jupajj lurañap sum yatïna.
Or there is something.	Jan ukajj kunas utji.
I for one take it very seriously.	Nayax mä tuqitx wali ch’amampiw uñjta.

He didn’t know anyone else.	Jupax janiw khitis ukham lurañ yatkänti.
Maybe not this harsh, but harsh.	Inas jan aka qhuru, jan ukasti qhuru.
And he decided to quit on his own.	Ukat jupa pachpaw jaytañ amtäna.
I never wanted to.	Janipuniw munkayätti.
And he left early in the morning.	Ukat wali alwat sarjjäna.
Do it now, please.	Jichhajj uk luram.
One thing he said doesn't matter.	Mä kuntï siskäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.

He made a careful decision.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw amtäna.

He didn't really know what to do with himself.	Jupajj janiw cheqapuni kunsa jupa pachpa lurañap yatkänti.
This was a shock to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj walpun muspharäna.
Always him, of course.	Sapa kutiw juparux, chiqpachansa.
But I don’t have it.	Ukampis janiw nayan utjkituti.
That was it, and he left.	Ukhamänwa, sasaw sarjjäna.
He eventually walked away from it reluctantly.	Jupajj qhepatjja, jan munasiñampiw uka toqet sarjjäna.
A little snowflake as well.	Mä jisk’a ch’uqi ukhamaraki.
No really, he did.	Janiwa chiqpachansa, jupax ukhamwa luräna.

But if you want to, that's fine.	Ukampis munsta ukhajja, walikïskiwa.
They’re better here than I am.	Jupanakax aka chiqanx nayat sipan juk’amp askiwa.
He is cruel and cruel.	Jupax qhuru ukat qhuru jaqiwa.
I want to use all the cash next time.	Nayax jutïr kutin taqpach qullqi apnaqañ munta.
I thought it wasn't.	Nayajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyayäta.
I doubt he ever felt that way.	Jupajj kunjamatsa ukham jikjjatasïna sasaw pächasta.
He began to speak immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw parlañ qalltäna.
But he always denied it.	Ukampis jupajj sapa kutiw jan arskänti.
He kept coming.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jutäna.
He spoke fluently, quietly.	Jupajj wali sumwa parläna, amukiw parläna.
Of course, he didn't know.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw uk yatkänti.
He began to speak.	Jupax parlañ qalltäna.

Anyone could do it, and you are tall and thin.	Khitis uk luraspänwa, ukat jumax jachʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqïtawa.

She rolled her eyes at him.	Juparux nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
No we don't have that.	Janiwa jiwasajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

Let’s see the next steps.	Jutïr lurañanak uñjañäni.
But he doesn’t go alone.	Ukampis janiw sapak sarkiti.
You know who.	Jumax yatisktawa khitis.
He walks at night, after all.	Jupax arumaw sarnaqäna, taqi kunat sipansa.
Twenty, thirty years.	Pä tunka, kimsa tunka mara.
I don't agree at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa iyaw siskti.
Breakfast and lunch are excellent.	Desayuno ukat chika uru manq’añax wali sumawa.
He preferred to do so.	Jupajj ukham lurañaw jukʼamp munäna.
First things first.	Nayrïr kunaw nayrïr.
I think that’s a funny part.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä chiqaw wali muspharkañawa.

In fact, he is doing better.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼamp sumwa luraski.
That was all he saw.	Ukakiw jupajj uñjäna.
It promises to be a good day.	Mä suma uruw utjani sasaw arsuwayi.
He said that it really was.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa sasaw säna.
Those two are really fun.	Chiqpachansa uka pä kusiskañawa.
But then he stayed out for a long time.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, walja tiempow anqan qheparäna.
I’m definitely not.	Nayax chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkti.
So it was all unnecessary.	Ukhamajj taqe kunas janiw wakiskänti.
Now that's pretty amazing.	Jichhajj ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
It’s the last night.	Ukax qhipa arumaw.
He said it wasn’t necessary.	Jupax janiw wakiskiti sasaw säna.
Fortunately, it’s easy to do.	Wali askiwa, ukax lurañax wali ch’amawa.

There is no good air.	Janiwa suma thaya utjkiti.

Of course he doesn’t.	Chiqansa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Well, thank you very much.	Ukhamawa, walpun yuspärta.
And, there is nothing like it.	Ukat, janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
But it is still hugely enjoyable.	Ukampis wali jachʼa kusiskañawa.

He meant it sincerely.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw ukham sañ munäna.
But then he went back again.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa kuttʼjjäna.
Alone and alone.	Sapaki ukat sapaki.
That went to the first place.	Ukaw nayrïr cheqar saräna.
He lived it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham sarnaqäna.
And there’s nothing wrong here.	Ukat aka chiqanx janiw kunas jan walïkiti.
It’s rough and nasty and very exciting.	Ukax qhuru ukat jan wali ukat wali kusiskañawa.
There’s always somewhere more to go.	Sapa kutiw kawkhans juk’amp sarañax utji.
There is time for that.	Ukatakejj tiempow utji.

He didn't say a word.	Jupajj janiw mä arunak arskänti.
But there is a lot of work to be done.	Ukampis walja lurañaw wakisi.
Of course, this is very rare.	Chiqansa, ukax wali jukʼakiw utji.
That is not what is happening.	Ukajj janiw kunas pasaski ukajja.
He came after her.	Jupajj jupar qhepatwa jutäna.
He understood the words in a new and terrifying sense.	Jupax uka arunak machaq ukat wali axsarkañ amuyumpiw amuyäna.
It looks very cool.	Ukax wali thaya uñtatawa.
I realized this immediately.	Uk jankʼakiw amuyayäta.

No one said anything bad about him.	Janiw khitis jupat jan wali arunak arskänti.

Here's what that means.	Ukajj kunsa sañ muni uk akham uñjañäni.

But that was not necessary now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukajj wakiskänti.
Overall, it’s a lot of fun.	Taqi kunat sipansa, wali kusiskañawa.

Of course there was nothing.	Chiqansa janiw kunas utjkänti.

And just do it that way.	Ukat ukhamakiw lurañama.

For all practical purposes this would be useful.	Taqi kuna lurañatakix ukax wali askïspawa.

But he issued the message.	Ukampis jupaw uka yatiyäw apsüna.
Now it’s time for a drive.	Jichhax mä auto apnaqañ pachaw purini.
Let's do it quickly.	Jankʼak lurañäni.

He’s a really nice guy.	Chiqpachansa mä suma jaqiwa.
That’s certainly the reason.	Chiqpachansa ukax kunatsa utji.
I can do no more for you.	Nayajj janiw jumatak jukʼamp lurirjamäkti.
He tried not to do it.	Jupajj jan lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
He's a nice guy.	Jupajj ukhamwa luri.
So far, it hasn't been.	Jichhakamajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to rush her.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak jupar jankʼak lurañ munkänti.
It’s surprisingly clear.	Ukax muspharkañ qhanawa.
I thought everyone knew.	Nayax taqiniw yatipxi sasaw amuyayäta.
Never mind, he says.	Janipuniw kunäkisa, sasaw saraki.
The first time? 	¿Nayrïr kuti?
He needs to have a party.	Jupajj mä fiesta lurañaw wakisi.
But there is no time for that.	Ukampis ukatakix janiw tiempox utjkiti.
Other people seem interesting.	Yaqha jaqinakax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
There were none of these people.	Janiw uka jaqenakajj utjkänti.
I don’t like this cold winter.	Nayax janiw aka thaya juyphi pachax gustkituti.
I don't do that here.	Nayajj janiw akan ukham lurkti.

And really, that was all you needed.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukakiw jumatakix wakisïna.

He’s a great guy.	Jupax wali jach’a waynawa.
That's why I feel bad.	Ukatwa jan walinak jikjjatasta.
He told me that you felt the same way.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw amuyasta sasaw sitäna.
But that can happen a lot.	Ukampis ukajj walpun pasaspa.
What was the right thing to do? 	¿Kunsa lurañajj wakisïna?
Long may it be good for you.	Jaya pachaw jumatakix wali askïspa.

That guy is not what you want him to be.	Uka waynax janiw kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.
He told me not to do it.	Jan luramti sasaw sitäna.

Nobody can make this film.	Janiw khitis aka película lurkaspati.

There will be no dinner for anyone tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw khitirus manq’añax utjkaniti.
No, he didn’t do that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham lurkänti.
He would do whatever it took.	Jupajj kunatï wakiski uk luraspänwa.
It’s very very nice.	Ukax wali wali sumawa.
I don’t know him at all, really.	Nayax janiw juparux kuns uñt’kti, chiqpachansa.

He almost did it.	Jupajj niyaw uk luräna.
Honestly, he’s fine.	Chiqpachansa, jupax walikïskiwa.
So, so rough.	Ukhama, ukhama qhuru.
He was totally moved by it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa taqe chuyma chʼalljjtayasïna.
She was looking at him again.	Ukat wasitatwa jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
You know? 	Yattati?
A pretty good one too.	Mä suma suma ukhamaraki.

You’re such a good fit there.	Jumax ukham sumaw ukan jikxatasïta.

It is a huge, important thing.	Ukajj wali jachʼa, wali wakiskiriwa.
Tell me if he is wrong.	Jupajj jan walïki uk yatiyapjjeta.
Once in a while two.	Mä kuti pä.
And really, he needs to do that.	Ukat chiqpachansa, jupax ukham lurañaw wakisi.

But then he realized it again.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa amuyasïna.
But he was very surprised.	Ukampis jupajj walpun muspharäna.
He told her now.	Jupajj jichhajj jupar yatiyäna.
You’ll always be there.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukan jikxatasïta.
You know perfectly well that’s not the case.	Jumax sum yatta ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
So don't make it that small.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham jiskʼa lurañamäkiti.
He looks very mature.	Jupax wali jilïr uñnaqaniwa.
But he couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkaspänti.
I don't want to deny it.	Nayajj janiw uk arsuñ munkti.
The dinner was delicious.	Uka manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa.
Now we need to act quickly.	Jichhajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañasa.
I didn’t tell them that.	Janiw nayax jupanakar ukham siskti.
That’s what it meant.	Ukaw sañ munäna.
That’s kind of weird actually.	Ukax mä juk’a muspharkañawa chiqpachansa.
That was it for me at the time.	Uka tiemponjja nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
Maybe he’ll get to you this evening.	Inas jupax jichhür jayp’ux jumar purini.
There are two .	Ukax pä .
I didn’t have anyone.	Janiw khitis utjkitänti.
He had a rather fierce intensity about him.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qhuru chʼamampiw jupat parläna.
She’s a great woman.	Jupax wali jach’a warmiwa.
It was about speed.	Ukajj jankʼak lurañat parläna.
But we will not do this in one way or another.	Ukampis janiw mä toqetwa uk lurañäni.
But he refused to talk to her.	Ukampis janiw jupamp parltʼañ munkänti.
All of these things are happening.	Taqe ukanakaw pasaski.
I don’t have that.	Nayax janiw ukax utjkituti.
I never liked you.	Nayajj janipuniw jumar gustkituti.
No one knows who this person is.	Janiw khitis khitis aka jaqix uk yatkiti.
He’s still got it on.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw uka tuqit jikxatasïna.
Yeah, but it’s not.	Jïsa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I can do both.	Nayax panpachaniw lurasmati.
But remember what happened last night.	Ukampis kunatï nayra arumax paskäna uk jan armasimti.
I think this is more important.	Nayatakix akax juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
He takes such good care of himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham wali sum uñjasi.
It’s going to be a good day.	Mä suma uruw sañ muni.
No one has anything like that.	Janiw khitis ukham kunas utjkiti.
Of course he can do that.	Chiqansa jupax ukham luraspawa.
Long, terrible day.	Jaya, wali axsarkañ uru.
That in itself is not good enough.	Uka pachpajj janiw askïkiti.
Now don't forget.	Jichhajj jan armasimti.
I always know exactly when.	Nayax sapa kutiw kunapachas uk sum yatta.
The first time is more fun.	Nayrïr kutix juk’amp kusiskañawa.
But that’s all firmly in the past now.	Ukampis ukax taqpach ch’amampiw nayra pachanx jichhax.
I know how to do it.	Nayax kunjams uk lurañ yatta.
I want to do it right this time.	Nayax aka kutix chiqapar lurañ munta.
I think you better tell me.	Nayax amuyta, jumax juk’amp askiwa yatiyañama.
I’m still in love with you.	Nayax jumamp wali munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
I really don’t think he is.	Chiqpachansa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
He looked at her almost sadly.	Niya llakitaw uñjäna.
I think yes, maybe.	Nayax jïsa sasaw amuyta, inas.
I want some fresh air, he said.	Mä juk’a suma thaya munta, sasaw säna.
But he didn't do that to me.	Ukampis janiw nayarojj ukham lurkänti.
Many times it is not good.	Walja kutiw jan walin uñjasi.

You already know that.	Jumax nayratpach uk yatisktawa.
That’s how it is for me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix utji.
You can actually do anything.	Chiqpachansa kunsa lurasma.
It doesn’t have anything to do with you.	Janiw kunas jumamp lurañax wakiskiti.
It’s beautiful, and it works for me.	Wali sumawa, ukat nayatakix wali askiwa.
All in all, great day.	Taqi kuna, jach’a uru.
He did everything inside.	Jupajj taqe kunwa manqhan luräna.
No one does it better than me.	Janiw khitis nayat sipan jukʼamp sum lurkiti.

I don’t want to make this stuff up.	Nayax janiw aka yänak lurañ munkti.
Much bigger than me.	Nayat sipansa juk’amp jach’a.
It took me about an hour.	Nayatakix niya mä horaw munasïna.
But there, that happened a long time ago.	Ukampis ukanjja, ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
I saw it last night.	Nayax qhipa arumaw uñjta.
It's amazing for you.	Jumatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
We’ll do it in class tomorrow.	Qhipürux clasen lurañäni.
Everyone had a place.	Sapa mayniw mä chiqaw utjäna.
The real me.	Chiqpach nayax.
The car is not good enough.	Auto ukax janiw askïkiti.
Another such food potato.	Yaqha ukham manq’añ ch’uqi.
This was obvious to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasïna.
This is very clearly not the case.	Ukax wali qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
In terms of reach, it’s a big one.	Uka puriñ tuqitxa, mä jach’a jaqiwa.
He got it after all.	Jupajj taqe kunat qhepatwa uk katoqäna.
It was much colder here.	Aka chiqanx juk’amp thaya ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
And that’s what this is.	Ukat ukax akax ukhamawa.
That means everything.	Ukajj taqe kunaw sañ muni.
You really need to do something.	Chiqpachansa kuns lurañaw wakisi.
The same is true of urgency.	Ukhamarakiw jankʼak lurañax wakisi.
Tell me all about yourself.	Taqi kunas juma pachpat yatiyapxita.
She felt that she felt good about it.	Ukham lurasajj wali sum jikjjatasïna sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He marveled at every loud noise.	Sapa jachʼa arunak istʼasajj wal muspharäna.
And we’re not like that.	Ukat jiwasax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was choked up.	Jupajj chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
It seems impossible now.	Jichhajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
But it had to be done from a distance.	Ukampis jaya toqet lurañaw wakisïna.
But there is plenty of time later for that.	Ukampis ukatakejj qhepat walja tiempow utji.
That feels good to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
Where is this going.	Kawkirus akax saraski.
So seriously good.	Ukhama sinti suma.
Now you’re still happy.	Jichhax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
But he didn't want to talk to me.	Ukampis janiw nayamp parlañ munkänti.
Cold and no rain.	Thaya ukat jan jallu.
He went with her.	Jupampiw saräna.
He wants to live here.	Jupax akan jakañ muni.
I loved doing that.	Ukham lurasajj walpun munasta.
It happened all day.	Ukajj taqe uruw pasäna.
There was too much light.	Ukanx sinti qhanaw utjäna.
But that's kind of weird.	Ukampis ukajj mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
It’s not available anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans utjkiti.
He learned a lot.	Jupajj walpun yateqäna.
The box is found.	Ukajj jikjjatasi.
I think you know better.	Jumaw jukʼamp sum yatta sasaw amuyta.
Do the things you want to do.	Kunanaktï lurañ munkta ukanak luram.
It’s not even the first time.	Janiw nayrïr kutis ukhamäkiti.
Mary thought it was important.	Mariajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyäna.
No, it’s not impossible.	Janiwa, janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
Honestly, that’s the only thing that makes sense.	Chiqpachansa, ukakiw wali askïspa.
He can't be there.	Janiw jupajj utjkaspati.
He doesn't seem to know exactly what to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañapa uk jan sum yatkaspa ukhamwa amuyasi.
Where I come from doesn't matter to me.	Kawkitsa jutta uk janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkti.
But he had one thing in mind.	Ukampis mä toqetwa jupajj amtäna.
He was shocked but a little touched by it.	Jupajj wal muspharäna ukampis uka toqetwa mä jukʼa chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
Is it really possible .	¿Chiqapunit ukham lurañax wakisispa .
I appreciate this very much.	Nayax akax wali askit uñjta.
After that, I said nothing.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kuns siskti.
Not a lot of money.	Janiw walja qullqix utjkiti.
And he made time.	Ukat jupax tiempo lurawayi.
I don’t mean it, not really.	Janiw nayax uk sañ munkti, janiw chiqpachansa.
So that was my personal opinion.	Ukhamajj naya pachpaw ukham amuyäna.
He decided not to do it.	Uk jan lurañwa amtäna.
It’s something old and something new.	Ukax kuna nayra ukat kuna machaq.
Why does everything exist.	Kunatsa taqi kunas utji.
And it happened to me.	Ukat nayaruw pasäna.
I am not sure what he meant.	Kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
I can't do that anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp ukham lurirjamäkti.
A little more, of course.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi, chiqpachansa.
So it barely felt that way.	Ukhamajj jukʼakiw ukham amuyasïna.
So he shook it a little.	Ukatwa mä jukʼa chʼalljjtayasïna.
Which he does pretty much all the time.	Ukax jupax niya sapa kutiw luraski.
It was another hot day.	Uka urux yaqha junt’u uruw utjäna.
Here’s how it turned out.	Akax kunjams jikxatasïna uk uñjañäni.
It’s either too obvious or too obscure.	Ukax wali qhanawa jan ukax wali ch’amawa.
I don’t think so tonight.	Nayax janiw jichha arumax amuyta.
I can't stand him now.	Jichhajj janiw jupar aguantañjamäkiti.
Then he started talking to me.	Ukat nayamp parltʼañ qalltäna.
So, do you think you’re interested in this .	Ukhama, ¿jumax uka tuqit yatxatañ munasmati sasaw amuyta .
I don't say about anything.	Janiw kuna tuqitsa siskti.
It was a hot mess.	Ukax mä junt’u ch’uqi satänwa.
A balanced diet is also important.	Ukhamaraki, mä suma manq’añax wali wakiskiriwa.
I did this for about a year.	Niya mä maraw ukham lurawayta.
I’m so happy to be here!.	¡Jichhax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi!.
I mean that very sincerely.	Nayax wali taqi chuymaw uk sañ munta.
I don't know how much it costs.	Janiw qhawqha qullqis munasispa uk yatkti.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ukampis jupax janiw munkiti.
There are two of them.	Ukanx pä ukaw utji.
The question was a silent one.	Uka jisktʼajj mä amukiw utjäna.
How timing was everything.	Kunjamsa tiempojj taqe kunas utjäna.
I just think of it.	Nayax ukakiw amuyta.
I don’t think he would.	Janiw nayax ukham lurkaspati sasin amuyta.
I mean that with all my heart.	Taqe chuymaw uk sañ munta.
That no one cares .	Ukax janiw khitis kuns lurkiti .
I did everything wrong.	Nayajj taqe kunwa jan wal lurayäta.
I need someone to talk to.	Nayax khitimpis parltʼañ munta.
I don’t know how it feels.	Nayax janiw kunjams jikxatasi uk yatkti.
And so he is.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj.
And that’s really all there is to it.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukakiw utji.
I like it, but it’s still weird.	Nayax wali askiwa, ukampis wali muspharkañawa.
That leaves a guy.	Ukax mä waynaruw jaytawayi.
Like I've been doing.	Kunjamtï nayajj lurkta ukhama.
Dear me, he thought she looked so small.	Munat naya, jupax wali jisk’a uñnaqaniwa sasaw amuyäna.
This was really always this little moment.	Akax chiqpachansa sapa kutiw aka jisk’a pachax utjäna.
You don’t have to replicate everything.	Janiw taqi kuns uñtasit lurañax wakiskiti.
At the moment they are.	Jichha pachanx jupanakax.
But, tell me something.	Ukampis, kuns yatiyapxita.
I thought he did it really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa uk luräna sasaw amuyayäta.
He himself often had nothing.	Jupa pachpaw walja kutix jan kunas utjkänti.
But that was never the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
That’s a really long way to go.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali jaya pachaw saraski.
It’s a woman .	Ukax mä warmiwa .
He wouldn’t do it any other way.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit lurkaspati.
Maybe sometime happening.	Inas kunapachas pasaspa.
Whoever he was.	Khitis jupax ukhamänwa.
He could never do anything.	Jupajj janipuniw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
A couple of weeks later, something happened.	Mä pä semana qhepatjja, kunas pasäna.
Or he will do something.	Jan ukajj kunsa lurani.
I really feel good about how it turned out.	Chiqpachansa kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk uñjasajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
But he didn't say much.	Ukampis janiw sinti arskänti.
Nothing is all-inclusive.	Janiw kunas taqi kunas lurañjamäkiti.
I know about it well enough.	Uka toqet sumwa yatta.
I had done enough, he thought.	Nayajj walpun lurawayta, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
It’s obvious he doesn’t like me.	Jupax janiw nayar munkiti ukax qhanawa.
It was obvious that he did not like the man.	Uka chachajj janiw jupar gustkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Or it just went away.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
I guess that's why he left her.	Ukatwa jupar jaytawayi sasaw amuyta.
Foolish, he thought.	Loqhe, sasaw amuyäna.
I drink my last cup of coffee, long since cold.	Nayax qhipa café umañ yatta, nayratpachaw thaya.
Overall, he felt good that morning.	Taqi kunat sipansa, uka alwax wali sum jikxatasïna.
So, yeah, that’s good.	Ukhama, jïsa, ukax wali askiwa.
I think he seemed like a good guy.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
Straight and short.	Chiqa ukat jisk’a.
It needed something.	Ukatakejj kunas munasïna.
Still nothing to do.	Wali janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
Not very good, really.	Janiw wali askïkiti, chiqpachansa.
You’ve always been the best.	Jumax nayratpach wali suma jaqïtawa.
But not last night.	Ukampis janiw qhipa arumax ukhamäkänti.
No, there was nothing to do.	Janiwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
Everything lasts a year.	Taqi kunas mä maraw utji.
There, it was beautiful.	Ukanjja, wali sumapunïnwa.
I just feel hot like that.	Nayax ukhamakiw junt’u jikxatastxa.
Now we have both.	Jichhax panpachaniw utjistu.
It doesn’t work anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha chiqan irnaqkiti.
He wanted to do it better.	Uk jukʼamp sum lurañ munäna.
And that’s all there is to it.	Ukat ukakiw ukax utji.
Not that again.	Janiw ukax mayampsa.
It seemed to be a nightly occurrence.	Ukajj sapa arumaw mä pasäna ukhamänwa.
I don’t want to work on it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit irnaqañ munkti.
This is what you need to do every week.	Ukax sapa semanaw ukham lurañax wakisi.
But this time we have .	Ukampis aka tiemponjja, jiwasajj .
Great that I like.	Jach’a ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas jumatakix utjkiti.
I said it was the first time.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw sasaw sista.
I have no idea where it is.	Nayax janiw kawkhans utji ukx amuykti.
He desperately wanted more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw wal munäna.
I want something unique.	Nayax mä jan uñt’at yänak munta.
And it was nothing major.	Ukat janiw kuna jachʼa lurañas utjkänti.
Gentle and uncomfortable, somehow.	Llamp’u ukat jan wali, kunjamatsa.
Another good word that.	Yaqha suma aru uka.
If you want to join the party, do so.	Uka fiestar mantañ munsta ukhajja, ukham lurañamawa.
He needed help and he knew it.	Jupajj yanaptʼa munasïna ukat uk sum yatïna.
These are readily available, which is important.	Ukanakajj jankʼakiw jikjjatasi, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But one night with him isn’t enough.	Ukampis jupamp mä arumax janiw wakiskiti.
A beautiful place, actually.	Mä suma chiqa, chiqpachansa.
In fact, in many cases it is not.	Chiqansa, walja kutix janiw ukhamäkiti.
That didn't mean that.	Ukajj janiw ukham sañ munkänti.
All of this produced negative results.	Taqe ukanakaw jan walinak apsüna.
A crisis waiting to happen.	Mä jan waltʼäwejj pasañap suytʼaski.
It’s not the most economically viable option.	Janiw qullqi tuqitx juk’amp askïkiti.
This time it got to me.	Jichha kutix nayaruw puri.
And a great one that.	Ukat mä jach’a mä uka.
It's not right now.	Jichhajj janiw walïkiti.
They are both first and foremost.	Jupanakax panpachaniw nayraqat ukat juk’ampi.
He had already done something.	Jupajj nayratpachaw kuns luratayna.
Something like that actually happened.	Chiqpachansa, ukham kunas pasäna.
And he wanted her again.	Ukat wasitatwa jupar munäna.
So he told me.	Ukatwa jupajj sapjjetäna.
And when it does .	Ukat kunapachatï ukham luraski ukhaxa .
That was what scared him the most.	Ukaw jupar wal ajjsaräna.
This is more important than you might expect.	Ukajj kunjamtï jumajj suykayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
He was always like that.	Jupajj sapa kutiw ukham sarnaqäna.
It could be better but it doesn’t seem to be good enough.	Juk’amp askïspawa ukampis janiw askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
I decided that well.	Nayax uk sum amtawayta.
And that’s why it’s wrong.	Ukat ukatwa jan walïki.
He knew what we were doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk jupajj sum yatïna.
But I wanted nothing more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkayätti.
Now, it just isn’t.	Jichhax, ukhamakiw jan ukhamäkiti.
Which, of course, is what happened.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, kunatix luraskäna ukawa.
I don’t know that for sure.	Nayax janiw uk sum yatkti.
I told him that.	Nayaw jupar uk sista.
I don't believe that at all.	Nayajj janiw uk kuns creykti.
He knew he knew it.	Jupajj uk yatïna uk sum yatïna.
He lay quietly, not saying much.	Jupax amukiw ikiskäna, janiw sinti arskänti.
He would never do that again.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa ukham lurkaspänti.
Let's see how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk uñjañäni.
He said it quietly.	Jupajj amukiw uk säna.
He loves me so much.	Jupajj nayamp walpun munasi.
But I don't have any time.	Ukampis janiw kuna tiempos utjkituti.
I decided to say sorry, sorry.	Nayax perdón, perdón sañ amtawayta.

You can do this yourself at home.	Utan juma pachpaw uk lurasma.

They know it very well.	Jupanakax wali sum yatipxi.

Three more days.	Kimsa uruw juk’ampi.
In addition to all of these.	Taqi ukanakat sipansa.
He wants to talk about me.	Jupajj nayat parlañ muni.
It’s done it for a long time.	Walja pachaw lurawayi.
He told her again today, and she was right.	Jichhüruw wasitat yatiyäna, ukat chiqaw sasaw säna.

He doesn’t want to go there.	Janiw ukar sarañ munkiti.
And that's not so bad.	Ukat ukajj janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
He does nothing during the day.	Jupajj janiw urun kunsa lurkiti.
You can’t not do that.	Janiw jan ukham lurañax utjkaspati.
But one remained.	Ukampis mayniw qheparäna.
He refuses everything.	Jupax taqi kuns janiw sañ munkiti.
But I mean that.	Ukampis nayajj uk sañ munta.
You want to live.	Jumax jakañ munta.
And nobody wants to say that.	Ukat janiw khitis ukham sañ munkiti.

Not what he wanted.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukjja.

Anywhere, of course.	Kawkhansa, chiqpachansa.

In fact, he planned this whole holiday.	Chiqansa, jupax aka taqpach fiesta amtawayi.

He said he wanted to do something.	Jupax kuns lurañ munta sasaw säna.
This is a terrible man.	Akax wali axsarkañ jaqiwa.

Here, it’s more obvious.	Akax, juk’amp qhanawa.
But he thought it would happen soon.	Ukampis niyaw ukham pasani sasaw amuyäna.
Everything looks great, he did a great job.	Taqi kunas wali suma uñtatawa, jupax mä jach’a irnaqäw lurawayi.

And it’s not impossible.	Ukat janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
But you are not like that.	Ukampis janiw jumajj ukhamäkiti.

Everything about this night is good for me.	Taqi kunas aka arumax nayatakix wali askiwa.

He played baseball, she played the piano.	Jupajj béisbol tocañ yatïna, jupajj piano tocañ yatïna.
Of course, there are no good people.	Chiqansa, janiw suma jaqinakax utjkiti.

He told her with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar yatiyäna.

To be honest, he didn’t really want to know.	Chiqpachansa, janiw chiqpachapuni yatiñ munkänti.

He’s a very nice guy and he’s very rich.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa ukat wali qamir jaqiwa.
I love tennis.	Nayax tenis ukarux walpun munasta.
But it’s almost always helpless.	Ukampis niya sapa kutiw jan kun lurañjamäkiti.

But he wanted it that way.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamwa munäna.
It spoke with great force.	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw parläna.
But he saw more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw uñjäna.
Now, let’s see here.	Jichhax, akan uñjañäni.
When he moved, he moved quickly.	Kunapachatï jupax yaqha chiqar sarxäna ukhaxa, jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.

This is very important to me right now.	Akax nayatakix jichhax wali wakiskiriwa.
One, one of a kind.	Mä, mä kasta.
I immediately saw the possibilities there.	Ukanjja, jankʼakiw kunanaktï lurañjamäki uk uñjta.
He never liked them at all.	Jupajj janipuniw kunjamatsa jupanakajj gustkänti.
I did it all over again.	Nayajj taqe ukanak wasitatwa lurayäta.
I want to come see you anyhow.	Nayax kunjamatsa jumar uñjir jutañ munta.
It was the first time he wanted to talk about it.	Nayrïr kutiw uka tuqit parltʼañ munäna.
He was going to do a good job.	Jupajj mä suma trabajo lurañwa amtäna.
She’s obviously a woman.	Jupax qhanaw warmiwa.
You’re so sorry .	Jumax wali llakitaw jikxatastaxa .

So okay, so okay.	Ukhamajj walikïskiwa, ukhamajj walikïskiwa.
So now what is it? 	Ukhamajj jichhajj ¿kunsa?
He walked around a little bit.	Mä juk’a sarnaqäna.
This was a moment of great joy.	Ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
That’s exactly what it felt like.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
It’s all good though.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa ukampis.

So far, so unusual.	Jichhakamax, ukhama jan uñt’atawa.
But let me know when it gets here.	Ukampis kunapachas aka chiqar purini uk yatiyapxita.
Two days later, he sees her again.	Pä uru qhepatjja, wasitatwa jupar uñji.
He was as nice as can be.	Jupajj kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukham suma jaqënwa.
It started to rain again.	Wasitat jallu puriñ qalltäna.
He was alone in the house.	Jupax sapakiw uka utan jikxatasïna.

This time it’s more difficult.	Jichha kutix juk’amp ch’amawa.
And that’s the ugly part of it.	Ukat ukax jan wali chiqaw uka tuqitxa.

He still said he hadn't seen it.	Jupajj janiw uñjkti sasaw wali säna.
But he wholeheartedly agreed with her.	Ukampis jupajj taqe chuymaw jupamp iyaw säna.
Or half the time.	Jan ukajj chikat tiempo.

Or, really, it’s that much fun.	Jan ukax, chiqpachansa, ukham wali kusiskañawa.
It’s looking much better.	Ukax juk’amp sumaw uñjasi.
Three years later, he asked them again.	Kimsa mara qhepatjja, wasitatwa jupanakar jisktʼäna.

Now, someone maybe.	Jichhax, maynix inas.

The next day he started regularly.	Qhipürux jupax sapa kutiw qalltäna.
Great day, tomorrow.	Jach’a uru, qharüru.

These are rare, but they are impressive.	Ukanakajj jukʼakiw utji, ukampis wali muspharkañawa.

He said he didn’t like it.	Jupax janiw gustkituti sasaw säna.
Or whatever it could be.	Jan ukajj kunanakas ukajj utjaspa.

Maybe he likes me.	Inas jupajj nayar munasispa.
I don't know how to do that.	Kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janiw yatkti.
He couldn't focus on it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet chuym churañ puedkänti.
I can tell he doesn’t really want to eat.	Jupax janiw chiqpachans manq’añ munkiti ukx yattwa.

A lot of it is about that.	Walja ukanakaw uka tuqitxa.

There seemed to be no other option.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkaspati sasaw amuyasïna.
That was something he knew.	Ukajj mä kunwa jupajj sum yatïna.
He didn't want it here.	Jupajj janiw akan munkänti.
He didn’t want to know about the car, of course.	Jupax janiw uka autot yatiñ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
Say what you want for yourself.	Juma pachpaw kuntï munkta uk sañama.
Do whatever you want.	Kuntï munkta uk lurañamawa.
Importantly, though, it's OK.	Ukampis wali wakiskiriwa, ukajj walikïskiwa.
He spoke very quietly.	Jupax wali amukiw parläna.
It rarely rains much here.	Aka chiqanx juk’akiw jallux wal puri.

He doesn't want to go to the hospital.	Jupajj janiw hospitalar sarañ munkiti.
He did it with all his heart.	Taqe chuymaw uk luräna.
But there are not many rich people.	Ukampis janiw walja qamir jaqenakajj utjkiti.
But that's all he has right now.	Ukampis jichhajj ukakiw jupajj utji.
No one said never.	Janiw khitis janipuniw siskänti.

He thought that was amusing.	Jupax ukax wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyäna.
But it’s not going to happen.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañax utjkaniti.

He knows a lot about himself.	Jupa pachpat wal sum yati.

In fact, he did very well.	Chiqansa, jupax wali sumwa luratayna.

He might do well himself.	Inas jupa pachpajj wali sum luraspa.
He seemed to be in a good mood.	Suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I saw him that night.	Uka arumaw jupar uñjta.
Very fast, actually.	Wali jaya, chiqpachansa.
But he was such a great guy.	Ukampis jupajj ukham jachʼa jaqënwa.
If you want to do something well, do it yourself.	Kuns sum lurañ munsta ukhajja, juma pachpaw uk luram.
So much better for me.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
But I love doing it.	Ukampis uk lurañajj walpun gustitu.

I don’t have any great reason.	Janiw kuna jach’a razonas utjkituti.

And he bought another one.	Ukat yaqha alasïna.
Or maybe it’s .	Jan ukajj inas ukajj .
You know, he does it every year.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax sapa maraw uk luraski.

But the ride was surprisingly smooth.	Ukampis uka autot sarañajj muspharkañ sumapunïnwa.
It’s hard, but fun.	Ukax ch’amawa, ukampis kusiskañawa.
He said it would happen soon.	Ukajj niyaw pasani sasaw säna.

So he understood that.	Ukhamajj uk jupajj amuyasïna.
He decides everything.	Jupaw taqe kunsa amti.

No one was like that.	Janiw khitis ukhamäkänti.
Today was the day and he was the day.	Jichhüruw uka urux utjäna ukat jupaw uka urux utjäna.
I don’t understand all of this.	Janiw taqe ukanak sum amuykti.
I guess that says everything for now.	Nayax amuyta ukax jichhakamax taqi kunaw sañ muni.
He’s a bit of a character.	Jupax mä juk’a jaqiwa.
One day it doesn’t.	Mä urux janiw ukhamäkiti.
He stayed behind me.	Jupajj naya qhepatwa qheparäna.
It is very important today.	Jichhürunakanxa wali wakiskiriwa.
It just started going down.	Ukax jichhakiw sarañ qalltäna.
I don’t want to get another word out of him.	Janiw jupat yaqha aru apsuñ munkti.
It was a big one.	Ukajj jachʼa jaqënwa.
It doesn’t work the first time.	Janiw nayrïr kuti irnaqkiti.
Mary is more important.	Mariajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
I don’t have a single one.	Janiw mä sapak utjkituti.
And this man gave him something more.	Ukat aka jaqix juparux juk’amp kuns churäna.
I never thought of it that way.	Nayax janipuniw ukham amuyta.
Naked naked naked blood, a lot.	Q’ala q’ala q’ala wila, walja.
Not what he really thinks.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj cheqpachapun amuyki ukhamäkiti.
Now, that’s a rich man.	Jichhax, ukax mä qamir jaqiwa.
I’d rather do the day.	Nayax uru lurañax juk’amp askiwa.
But that doesn't mean all of this is impossible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw taqe ukanakajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham sañ munkiti.
Better than nothing but not necessary.	Jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa ukampis janiw wakiskiti.

I don't want much.	Janiw walpun munkti.
He came to see them another time.	Jupajj yaqha kutiw jupanakar uñjir jutäna.
His feelings were not what he wanted.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna ukajj janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukhamäkänti.
You know everything.	Jumax taqi kun yatisktawa.
Long doesn’t mean too much too much.	Jaya pachax janiw sinti sinti jach’a sañ munkiti.
That's all there is to it.	Ukakiw ukatakejj utji.
For me, that really ended it.	Nayatakix ukax chiqpachapuniw tukuyäna.
Everything is very clear now.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali qhanaw uñjasi.
Maybe there is nothing.	Inas jan kunas utjkaspati.
Don’t make a surprise.	Janiw mä muspharkañ lurañamäkiti.
It’s really just that.	Chiqpachansa ukax ukhamakiw.
I never expected anything like this .	Janipuniw ukham kuns suykayätti .
The last joint was the night before.	Qhipa junt’u manq’añax nayrïr arumaw utjäna.
He always seemed to be in a good mood.	Jupajj sapa kutis suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But it hasn’t always been that way.	Ukampis janiw nayratpach ukhamäkänti.
To be honest, he didn't want one.	Chiqpachansa, janiw mä jukʼa munkänti.
I’m the only one who knows this, at least.	Naya sapakiw uk yatta, juk’ampi.
That problem is not current.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw jichha tiempon utjkiti.
I don't intend to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham amtkti.
No really, twice as much, a lot twice as much.	Janiwa chiqpachansa, pä kuti jila, walja pä kuti jila.
You will feel better about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatasïta.
He doesn't have to do it all himself.	Janiw jupa pachpajj taqe ukanak lurañapäkiti.
But there’s nothing to do.	Ukampis janiw kunas lurañax utjkiti.
But, on a larger scale, it’s exciting.	Ukampis, juk’amp jach’a tuqitx wali kusiskañawa.
He asked me why three.	Jupax kunatsa kimsa sasaw jiskt’itu.
But now he is in trouble .	Ukampis jichhajj jupaw jan waltʼäwin uñjasi .
Not now, but later.	Janiw jichhajj utjkiti, jan ukasti qhepatwa.
I know how to mix myself up.	Naya pachpaw mistuñ yatta.
A little bit no more.	Mä juk’a janiw juk’ampi.
Remove the snowflakes from the snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He knew the rules.	Jupax kamachinak sum yatïna.
Well now this.	Suma jichhax aka.
No one wanted to leave.	Janiw khitis sarxañ munkänti.
He knew better, but he did it anyway.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum yatïna, ukampis kunjamatsa uk luräna.
I hope it lasts a long time.	Nayax suyt’twa ukax jaya pachaw utjani.
He was very happy about it.	Jupax uka tuqit wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Maybe that’s all we need.	Inas ukakiw jiwasatak wakisispa.
He wasn't sure if that was right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw sum yatkänti.
But what he does on a regular basis is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kuntï sapa kuti luraski ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Except it wasn’t, not really.	Jan ukasti janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkänti.
Winter is a good time.	Juyphi pachax wali askiwa.
He didn't like the words.	Jupajj uka arunak janiw munkänti.
You gave me something.	Jumax kuns churitu.
Kind of big, actually.	Mä juk’a jach’a, chiqpachansa.
I'm better than you.	Nayajj jumat sipansa juk'amp sumawa.
There is something to be done here.	Aka chiqanx mä kunaw lurañax utji.
And it takes some time to do that.	Ukat uk lurañatakix mä qhawqha tiempow munasispa.
It’s almost too cautious.	Niya wali amuyumpiw uñjasi.
It very nearly worked.	Ukax wali niyaw irnaqäna.
It was clear what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He began to react immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kuns lurañ qalltäna.
People can have both.	Jaqinakax panpachaniw utjaspa.
But in doing so, he was staring at the moment.	Ukampis ukham lurasajj uka horasaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
It takes about half an hour.	Niya chika horaw sarañapa.
Or maybe now .	Jan ukajj jichhajj .
You don’t have to redo one every time.	Janiw sapa kuti mä wasitat lurañax wakiskiti.
Don't do anything to yourself.	Janiw juma pachpajj kuns luramti.
The things I do are always good.	Kunanaktï lurkta ukanakax sapa kutiw wali askïspa.
He loved it so much.	Jupajj uk wal munasïna.
I wanted to know who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk yatiñwa munta.
Something small, by the way.	Kunas jisk’a, ukhama.
Eventually, he knew what it was.	Qhepatjja, kunas uk yatïna.
Now he received a lot of money.	Jichhajj walja qollqe katoqäna.
But it really kind of is.	Ukampis chiqpachansa mä kasta ukhamawa.
No, it’s not a bad thing.	Janiwa, janiw jan walïkiti.
It seemed to be very beautiful.	Wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
There’s really nothing you can do about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
It’s really, really important.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali wakiskiriwa.
So it's amazing how it happened.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa ukajj pasäna ukajj muspharkañawa.
So he didn't want me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayar munkänti.
He looked more worried, now.	Jupax juk’amp llakitaw uñnaqäna, jichhax.
Not sure what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janiw sum yatkti.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Janiw khitis jupamp parlañ munkänti.
I am making a man.	Nayax jaqiruw luraskta.
He didn't even have to do that.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañas wakiskänti.
So, so, kind of.	Ukhama, ukhamawa, mä kasta.
It was secretive.	Ukajj jamasat sarnaqäna.

I’m barely here now.	Jichhax juk’akiw akanktxa.
And no, this is okay.	Ukat janiw, akax walikïskiwa.

And the whole next day, nothing.	Ukat taqpach qhipürux, janiw kunas utjkänti.

It was wonderful, she said.	Wali sumapunïnwa, sasaw jupajj säna.
I don’t want to leave for you.	Nayax janiw jumatakix sarxañ munkti.

This was not the case here.	Aka chiqanx janiw ukham lurañax utjkänti.
There isn’t a snack here.	Aka chiqanx janiw mä juk’a manq’añax utjkiti.
There he did more of it.	Ukanjja, jukʼampiw ukham luräna.
That’s what did the wrong thing.	Ukaw jan walinak luräna.
But you are still in pain.	Ukampis jumajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.

I really didn’t want to leave.	Chiqpachansa janiw sarxañ munkayätti.
But no one knows what to do.	Ukampis kuna lurañas wakisispa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Probably better than you think.	Inas jumax amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
He is waiting for you.	Jupajj jumaruw suytʼaski.

He started it all .	Jupaw taqe ukanak qalltäna .
And, then the villain did it again.	Ukat, ukat uka jan wali jaqix wasitat luratayna.
That was not what he wanted.	Ukajj janiw jupajj munkänti.
It’s very unusual for me.	Nayatakix wali jan uñt’atawa.
He wasn’t sure who did that.	Jupax janiw khitis ukham luratapat sum yatkänti.
Do you know how to use it? 	¿Uka apnaqañ yatta?
And the rain was wonderful.	Ukat jallux wali sumapunïnwa.
I would gladly buy him a beer.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw jupar mä cerveza alañ munta.
I don’t know why he said that.	Kunatsa ukham säna uk janiw yatkti.
I’ve been there all day.	Nayax urunakpachaw ukan jikxatasiyäta.
No one knew where he stayed.	Kawkhansa qheparäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
That was all right, he thought.	Ukajj walikïskiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
But it wasn’t always the case.	Ukampis sapa kutiw janiw ukhamäkänti.
He repeated it yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw wasitat arsüna.
And they’re beautiful.	Ukat jupanakax wali sumawa.
I want to do more and more.	Nayax juk’ampi juk’ampi lurañ munta.
That’s what I like about him.	Ukaw jupat wal gusti.

At some point, yes.	Mä qhawqha tiemponjja, jïsa.
Yes, he thought so.	Jïsa, jupajj ukhamwa amuyäna.
He did a lot of bad things.	Walja jan walinak lurawayi.
I couldn't understand how I felt when I saw him.	Jupar uñjasajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk janiw amuykayätti.
I'm doing my best.	Nayax taqi ch'amampiw luraskta.

Overall, the price is reasonable.	Taqi kunat sipansa, qullqix walikïskiwa.

He does it very well.	Jupax wali sumaw uk luri.
So maybe you need to do a few things like that.	Ukhamajj inas mä qhawqha lurañanak ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
He doesn’t exist.	Jupax janiw utjkiti.
After next week.	Jutïr semanan qhepatjja.

And for that matter .	Ukat uka tuqitxa .

He sees a silence.	Jupax mä amukiw uñji.
He thought he wanted to sleep.	Jupajj ikiñ munta sasaw amuyäna.
Overall, it’s beautiful.	Taqi kunat sipansa, wali sumawa.
But he refused to give up.	Ukampis jupajj janiw jaytañ munkänti.
This went on for years.	Ukajj walja maranakaw pasäna.

He sucked in himself.	Jupa pachpaw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
I’m sure you’re right.	Nayax chiqaw sasaw arsuwayta.
He couldn't sleep much.	Jupajj janiw sinti ikiñ puedkänti.
That is where you have to tell something.	Ukaw uka cheqan kuns yatiyañama.
That will come in a week.	Ukajj mä semana qhepatwa jutani.
And I decided to quit.	Ukat jaytañ amtawayta.
But it’s something that will happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani ukawa.
And it’s a great one, too.	Ukat mä jach’a jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
He asked me how much it would cost.	Jupajj qhawqha qollqsa munasini sasaw jisktʼitäna.
Nothing is uncertain.	Janiw kunas jan chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
You know that.'	Jumax uk yatisktawa’ sasaw säna.
This is not what anyone wanted.	Ukajj janiw khitis munkäna ukhamäkiti.
I gave him the phone.	Nayajj telefonot jupar churta.
He didn't want it any other way.	Jupajj janiw yaqha tuqitxa munkänti.
I think this is beautiful.	Nayatakix akax wali sumawa.
I think it was something.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä kunaw utjäna.
It really looks like that though.	Chiqpachansa ukhamakiw uñtasi ukampis.
Now I see what I see.	Jichhax nayax kuntix uñjkta uk uñjta.
He knew he had to do some kind of thing.	Jupajj mä kasta lurañaw wakisi uk sum yatïna.

All in all, you’re welcome!.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ¡jumax wali askiwa!.
Now now .	Jichhax jichhax .
Of course, it needs to be done, and it needs to be done quickly.	Chiqansa, lurañaw wakisi, ukat jankʼakiw lurañax wakisi.
He wants to do the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañwa muni.
That was what I needed.	Ukaw nayatakejj wakisïna.
You know, whatever.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunas.
That’s what scares this guy.	Ukaw aka waynax axsarayi.
He says it’s not like that.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw saraki.
I don’t want to do that in any way.	Nayax janiw kuna tuqitsa ukham lurañ munkti.
I don’t want to be like that.	Nayax janiw ukham sarnaqañ munkti.
Another time like this.	Yaqha pachax ukhama.

You are a human being.	Jumax mä jaqïtawa.

The same is true.	Ukhamarakiw jikxatasi.
He doesn't know who or what he is.	Jupajj janiw khitïnsa ni kunas uk yatkiti.
You don't have to.	Janiw jumanakajj wakiskiti.
He couldn't say that .	Jupajj janiw ukham sañ puedkänti .
I never went to school for it.	Janipuniw ukatakejj escuelar sarkti.
He was a man of conversation.	Jupajj parlir jaqënwa.
You have to do it twice.	Pä kuti lurañamawa.
New school, new school, bad school.	Machaq yatiqañ uta, machaq yatiqañ uta, jan wali yatiqañ uta.
He had a light.	Jupajj mä qhanaw utjäna.
But at the same time, you need to do less.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, jukʼamp jiskʼa lurañaw wakisi.
I want him all to myself.	Nayax juparux taqpach naya pachpaw munta.
I say that without malice.	Nayax jan jan wali amuyumpiw ukham sista.

He loved them more than anything.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼampiw jupanakar munasïna.

Finally, he lay quietly.	Qhepatjja, amukiw ikiskäna.
But the man was silent.	Ukampis uka jaqejj amukiw utjäna.
That’s all there is to it.	Ukax taqi kunaw utji.

It didn’t do it all alone.	Ukax janiw sapakix taqi ukanak lurkänti.

But none of that, really.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
I don't do that anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp ukham lurkti.

He never had anyone.	Jupajj janipuniw khitirus utjkänti.
He understood the urgency.	Jupajj jankʼak lurañwa amuyasïna.
I guess he was surprised to hear from me.	Nayat istʼasajj wal muspharta sasaw amuyasta.
I want to be honest here.	Nayax akan chiqapar sarnaqañ munta.
He didn't know all of that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa yatkänti.
He looks rough.	Jupax qhuru uñnaqaniwa.
Any or all of them.	Kawkïr jan ukax taqpach.
No one seemed to know where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
At the time, he thought so.	Uka tiemponjja, ukhamwa amuyäna.
Midnight after all.	Chika arumaw taqi kunat sipansa.

Either that, or he wanted to know.	Jan ukax ukax, jan ukax jupax yatiñ munäna.
I have no choice now.	Jichhajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti.

And then he would do it.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jupajj luraspänwa.

He is doing the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw luraski.
I didn't decide it myself.	Janiw naya pachpajj uk amtkti.
Let's see how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk uñjañäni.
I don't have anyone else.	Nayajj janiw yaqha jaqejj utjkituti.
There is something to be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa kuna lurañas utji.
I have never had that happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj utjkituti.
He does everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kunsa luraski.
No, he said it never mattered.	Janiwa, janipuniw kunas wakiskiti sasaw säna.
I know exactly where that is.	Ukajj kawkhansa uk sum yatta.
I’m a drinker.	Nayax umañ yatta.
As he was sleeping.	Kunjamtï jupajj ikiskäna ukhama.
And no, he’s not at all.	Ukat janiwa, jupax janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
He gave her a chance at a chance.	Jupax juparux mä ch’amampiw mä ch’am churäna.
I was told that, over and over again.	Ukham sasaw sapjjetäna, walja kutiw sapjjetäna.
But that one .	Ukampis uka maynix .
Or a little bit worse.	Jan ukax mä juk’a jan wali.
Didn't do much of anything.	Janiw kuns sinti lurkänti.
Now you’re very popular.	Jichhax jumax wali uñt’atawa.
And he worked hard.	Ukat wali chʼamampiw irnaqäna.
Why it really matters.	Kunatsa chiqpachansa ukax wakisi.
And he doesn’t want that.	Ukat janiw uk munkiti.
Just like ten years ago.	Kunjamtï tunka mara nayrajj lurkäna ukhama.
I didn't make him for you.	Janiw nayajj jupar jumatak lurkti.
He knew about it.	Jupaw uka toqet yatïna.
In fact, that’s all there ever is’.	Chiqansa, ukakiw kunapachas utji’.
So he told her.	Ukhamaw jupar yatiyäna.
And with me, too.	Ukat nayamp chika.
In fact, he openly says so.	Chiqansa, jupax qhanaw ukham arsu.
I'm looking forward to that.	Nayax uk suyt'askta.
And this isn’t your .	Ukat akax janiw jumanakan .
I was squeezed hard.	Nayajj wali chʼamampiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
Never had that for me, really.	Janipuniw ukax nayatakix utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
He doesn't ride.	Jupajj janiw kayuk sarkiti.
That all really says it.	Ukax taqpach chiqpachapuniw arsu.
He was sleeping amazingly.	Jupax muspharkañ ikiskäna.
There was nothing before.	Nayrajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
There is more to it .	Ukajj jukʼampiw utji .
And the weather is beautiful.	Ukat pachax wali sumawa.
And he couldn't do it right.	Ukat janiw sum lurañ puedkänti.
Which he certainly did.	Ukjja jupajj cheqapuniw luräna.
So he never said anything.	Ukhamajj janipuniw kuns arskänti.
But he couldn't go.	Ukampis janiw sarañ puedkänti.
Tell them every day.	Sapa uruw jupanakar sañama.
This may require doing something on your own.	Ukatakejj sapakiw kun lurañas wakisispa.
That’s what you need to do.	Ukhama lurañaw wakisi.
I would have a very interesting thing.	Nayax wali muspharkañ kunaw utjaspa.
He slammed him down.	Jupax juparux ch’allt’äna.
I never quite knew that.	Janipuniw uk sum yatkayätti.
That’s how it was for me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix utjäna.
How do you feel about it.	Kunjamsa jumajj jikjjatasta.
I want to get home.	Utar puriñ wal munta.
These seem to be very attractive.	Ukanakajj wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.
But again, nothing.	Ukampis mayampsa janiw kunas utjkiti.
And now you, of course.	Ukat jichhax jumax, chiqpachansa.
Nothing is worse.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
And that’s all in a city.	Ukat ukax mä markanx taqi kunas utji.
He knew that for sure.	Jupajj uk cheqapuniw yatïna.
I never knew what it was.	Janipuniw kunas uk yatkti.
I’ve talked about that a little bit.	Nayax uka tuqit mä juk’a arsuwayta.
You guys are the.	Jumanakajj uka...
And all the while it looks fantastic.	Ukat taqi uka pachanx wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
Or he never wanted to.	Jan ukajj janipuniw munkänti.
Or does it with someone.	Jan ukajj khitimpis luri.
It’s definitely worth the money.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw qullqix wali askiwa.
It stayed with me.	Ukajj nayamp chikaw qheparäna.
But also, whatever.	Ukampis ukhamarakiw, kunas.
So far, so real.	Jichhakamax, ukhama chiqpach.
Everything is fine though.	Taqi kunas wali sumawa ukampis.
You are a foreigner.	Jumax yaqha markankir jaqïtawa.
Everything is out of control.	Taqi kunas janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
They already know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk niyaw yatipxi.
I have done this recently.	Jichhakiw ukham lurawayta.
A simple yes or no question.	Mä jiskʼa jisktʼajj jïsa jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
There was no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañax wakiskänti.
And so are you guys.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jumanakax.
You know how this goes.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams akax saraski.
He didn't know it was going to happen.	Ukajj pasañap janiw yatkänti.
Do this, do that, do something else.	Ukham luram, ukham luram, yaqha luram luram.
And at any time.	Ukat kuna horasas wakisispa.
I know he doesn’t.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw uk lurkiti.
But these things had to be done.	Ukampis uka jan walinak lurañaw wakisïna.
Now that, it would be interesting.	Jichhax ukax, wali askïspawa.
But far, far away.	Ukampis jaya, jaya.
I know better than you know .	Nayajj jukʼamp sum yatta, jumajj yatisktawa .
Just do it .	Luram .
And the money is better.	Ukat qullqix jukʼamp sumawa.
I was excited to go to a new place.	Machaq chiqar sarañatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
So there will be no problem.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
And this is now.	Ukat akax jichhax ukhamawa.
This time they are.	Jichha kutix jupanakax ukhamawa.
What he thought he was.	Kunsa jupajj amuyäna.
That’s all it does for you.	Ukakiw jumatakix luraski.
Small, flat, flat.	Jisk’a, ch’uqi, ch’uqi.
I definitely don’t want to do that again this year.	Nayax chiqpachans janiw jichha marax wasitat ukham lurañ munkti.
Of course, not now.	Chiqansa, janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
There is nothing he can do to help.	Janiw kunas jupajj yanaptʼañatakejj lurkaspati.
Of course, that wasn't the case.	Chiqansa, janiw uka tuqitxa ukhamäkänti.
Do what you love and love.	Kuntï munkta ukat wal munkta uk luram.
He came home with us that day.	Uka urux nanakamp chikaw utar purinïna.
He left in great distress.	Jupajj wali llakitaw sarjjäna.
That’s all anyone knows.	Ukakiw khitis yati.
I always remember.	Nayax sapa kutiw amtasta.
It wasn't like that before.	Janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
He was pleasantly surprised.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw muspharäna.
You’re a human being.	Jumax jaqiwa.
But I'm not sure he did.	Ukampis jupajj ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Everything about this is beautiful.	Taqi kunas aka tuqitx wali sumawa.

They’re a bit .	Jupanakax mä juk’a .
Last chance, now or never.	Qhipa oportunidad, jichhax jan ukax janipuniw.
But it is not a good way to do this.	Ukampis uk lurañatakix janiw sum lurañjamäkiti.
Something really great .	Kunas chiqpachapuni jach'a .
He was very friendly and quiet.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, amukiw sarnaqäna.
But this isn’t the case.	Ukampis akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He will come for me next.	Jupaw jutïrin nayatak jutani.
The problem is obvious to me.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj nayatakejj qhanaw amuyasi.
The night is coming quickly.	Arumax jank’akiw purini.
But today he was very sad.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I wonder what will happen to him.	Kunas jupar pasani sasaw jisktʼasta.
He rolled his eyes at her.	Jupax juparux nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
This happened after two.	Ukajj pä qhepatwa pasäna.
Beyond that, there is nothing to do.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I have it with me now.	Jichhax nayamp chikaw utjitu.
But there’s something odd about him.	Ukampis jupat mä muspharkañ kunaw utji.
I did that a lot.	Uk walpun lurawayta.
He went to the house.	Uka utaparuw saräna.
And it wasn’t really there.	Ukat janiw chiqpachapunix utjkänti.
Do whatever you can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañamawa.
There, he does little damage.	Ukanjja, jukʼa jan walinak luri.
All those juicy snowflakes.	Taqi uka juyphi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He already knew this about himself.	Niyaw jupa pachpat uk yatïna.
He left yesterday morning .	Jupax qharüruw alwax sarxäna .
That does some work.	Ukaw mä qhawqha lurañanak luraski.
It’s like a big guy.	Jach’a jaqir uñtatawa.
I’m feeling a little better.	Nayax mä juk’a sumaw jikxatastxa.
He said a little more.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jukʼampiw säna.
I saw him tonight.	Nayax jichha arumaw jupar uñjta.
Large, but remarkably small.	Jach’a, ukampis wali muspharkañ jisk’a.
That’s how everything was.	Ukhamaw taqi kunas utjäna.
He was the bookmaker.	Jupaw libronak lurañ yatïna.
So I don’t have it.	Ukhamajj janiw nayan utjkiti.
Of course, you know what you want to get out of me.	Chiqansa, kuntï nayat apsuñ munkta uk jumax yatisktawa.
I don’t have any.	Janiw nayan utjkiti.
But it turns out that this was not necessary.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti sasaw amuyasi.
Make it what you want it to be.	Ukajj kunatï munkta ukar uñtasit lurañamawa.
He had done something.	Jupajj kunsa luratayna.
Never stop rushing.	Janipuniw jankʼak lurañ jaytañamäkiti.
Except you, of course.	Jan ukasti jumaw, chiqpachansa.
Or maybe he came again.	Jan ukajj inas wasitat jutäna.
But not all of these are necessary.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
That did the work.	Ukaw lurañanak luräna.
He has things you can do.	Jupajj kunanaktï lurañ yatkta ukanakaw utji.
I feel really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
But it seemed possible.	Ukampis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Didn't mean there was any kind of time.	Janiw kuna kasta tiempon utjkänti sañ munkänti.
A great beautiful eye.	Mä jach’a suma nayra.
I didn’t know what to do with him.	Janiw kunsa jupamp lurañ yatkayätti.
This is still a lot of individuals for you.	Akax wali walja sapa mayniw jumatakix utji.
That’s not what’s going on here.	Ukax janiw kunatix akan luraski ukax ukhamäkiti.
Yes, of course he did.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa jupaw ukham luräna.
He knew why he did it.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk sum yatïna.
So he appreciated everything we did.	Ukatwa taqe kuntï lurapkta uk jupajj wali askit uñjäna.
Himself, myself, and more myself.	Jupa pachpa, naya pachpa, ukat juk’amp naya pachpa.
Timing is of the essence at this crucial time.	Aka wali wakiskir pachanx pachax wali wakiskiriwa.
He immediately told her everything.	Ukat jankʼakiw taqe kun yatiyäna.
I don’t like you, I don’t like you.	Nayax janiw jumar munkti, nayax janiw jumar munkti.
But he won’t do it.	Ukampis janiw uk lurkaniti.
But he didn't want to talk about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet parltʼañ munkänti.
So this was the case.	Ukhamaw akax utjäna.
Let’s see if you can do that.	Uk lurasmati janicha uk uñjañäni.
I didn’t know why not.	Kunatsa jan uk janiw yatkayätti.
But it never felt that way.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham amuyaskänti.
I came to make something of myself.	Naya pachpat kuns lurañatakiw jutta.
For the first time.	Nayrïr kuti.
That went pretty well.	Ukax wali sumaw saräna.
But it took more time.	Ukampis jukʼamp tiempow munasïna.
I wanted to do that last year.	Nayax nayrïr marax ukham lurañ munta.
What was it that was.	Kunas ukajj utjäna.
You can do this quickly.	Ukjja jankʼakiw lurasma.
I think it’s good .	Nayatakix wali askiwa .
But not all of this is bad.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanakajj jan walïkiti.
He was a new man.	Jupajj machaq jaqënwa.
She immediately turned him down.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar jan iyaw säna.
So he gave it to her.	Ukatwa jupar churäna.
That's what he thought.	Ukhamaw jupajj ukham amuyäna.
It can be in itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw utjaspa.
I don’t know where this came from.	Nayax janiw kawkitsa akax uk yatkti.
There was plenty of time for that.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow utjäna.
No, it moved again.	Janiwa, ukax wasitatwa sarnaqäna.

She said no and pressed on.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna ukat chʼamachasïna.
That’s what decided it.	Ukaw uk amtäna.
I’m here every day.	Nayax sapa uruw akanktxa.

But he said nothing more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp kuns arskänti.
But, that happened a long time ago.	Ukampis, ukajj nayratpachaw pasäna.
It really doesn’t work for me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
He wants to come here.	Jupax akan jutañ muni.
So much needs to be done .	Ukhamajj walja lurañaw wakisi .
I don’t need to do this! 	¡Janiw nayax uk lurañax wakiskiti!

I don't particularly like it there.	Ukanjja, janiw nayatakejj jukʼamp gustkituti.
So he didn't want to go.	Ukhamajj janiw sarañ munkänti.
Who wants to take you out.	Khitis jumar apsuñ munki.
But it happened today.	Ukampis jichhüruw ukham pasäna.
I can’t find anything, but nothing.	Janiw kuns jikxatkti, ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
Maybe he is, too.	Inas jupax, ukhamaraki.

They make me feel good.	Jupanakajj wali sumaw jikjjatasta.

That doesn't mean there can't be one day.	Ukajj janiw mä urux janiw utjkaspati sañ munkiti.
But often things just aren’t.	Ukampis walja kutiw kunanakas jan ukhamäkiti.
Or somewhere, another snowflake.	Jan ukax kawkhans, yaqha ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I think it struck him.	Nayax amuyta, ukax juparux ch’allxtayäna.
There will be no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkaniti.
You can’t do anything about it.	Jumax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
It’s very sad, you know.	Wali llakitaw jikxatasi, jumax yatisktawa.
He didn't think anyone knew.	Jupajj janiw khitis yatkaspa ukham amuykänti.

About that, of course.	Uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.
No one can do anything to you.	Janiw khitis jumarux kuns lurkaspati.
He doesn’t want to see me.	Jupax janiw nayar uñjañ munkiti.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do now.	Jupajj janiw kuntï jichhajj lurañ munkäna uk sum yatkänti.

But the work did no more.	Ukampis uka lurañajj janiw jukʼamp lurkänti.

Then he shook it again.	Ukat wasitatwa chʼalljjtayasïna.
He did nothing to make it happen.	Jupajj janiw kuns ukham lurañatakejj lurkänti.
He is one of you.	Jupax jumanakat maynïriwa.
But these things take time.	Ukampis ukanak lurañatakejj tiempow munasispa.
They are very important.	Jupanakajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He didn't know exactly what he was going to do.	Kuntï lurani uk janiw sum yatkänti.

The timing is never bad.	Uka tiempojj janipuniw jan walïkiti.

He can't do anything.	Janiw kuns lurkaspati.
I want to know everything about you.	Nayax jumanakat taqi kun yatxatañ munta.
But he didn't know enough, he didn't know enough.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkänti, janiw sum yatkänti.
He just thinks so.	Jupax ukhamakiw amuyi.
I know in the next few days.	Nayax jutir urunakanx yatxatwa.

He knows about you	Jupaw jumat yati .
You don't have to eat there.	Janiw ukan manq'añax wakiskiti.

Timing is really important.	Tiempox chiqpachapuniw wali wakiskiriwa.
But it’s not much better than nothing.	Ukampis janiw jan kunat sipansa sinti askïkiti.
And this is how it all began.	Ukat taqe kunas akham sasaw qalltäna.
Because he can’t stand it.	Kunatix jupax janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
Very early, it could have done.	Wali nayra, ukax luraspänwa.
He never knew who would be next.	Khitis jutïrin utjani uk janipuniw yatkänti.
This is somewhat important.	Ukajj mä jukʼa wakiskiriwa.

No, he didn't do that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti.
But this is pretty cool.	Ukampis akax wali sumawa.
Let’s see how it goes today.	Jichhürunakan kunjamsa saraski uk uñjañäni.

That’s what he wants.	Ukhamaw jupax munki.
It’s all about making a good film.	Mä suma película lurañax taqi kunaw wakisi.
It’s really worth the effort.	Chiqpachansa, uka lurañax wali askiwa.
But it really doesn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkiti.
He rejects you, obviously.	Jupax jumarux janiw sasaw arsu, qhanawa.
I wonder where he is now.	Jichhajj kawkinsa jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasta.
I understand better today.	Jichhürunakanxa jukʼamp sum amuyta.
Not sure if I would buy it though.	Janiw yatkti nayax alañ munkti ukampis.
So he dropped the problem.	Ukatwa uka jan waltʼäw jaytawayi.
I plan to repeat this many times.	Walja kutiw ukham wasitat lurañ amtasta.
He wants something else, something more.	Jupax yaqha, juk’amp yänak munaraki.

You can’t do all that badly.	Janiw taqi ukanak jan walinak lurañjamäkiti.

Finally, he spoke up.	Qhepatjja, jupajj parläna.
He went with great speed.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw saräna.
It’s beautiful, it’s amazing.	Ukax wali sumawa, wali muspharkañawa.

So it doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj janiw kunäkisa.
Everything is already moving.	Taqi kunas niyaw sarnaqaski.
I’m not saying that.	Nayax ukax janiw sañ munkti.
And there is no time limit.	Ukat janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
He didn't want to talk to her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp parlañ munkänti.
But if he did, it would be really good.	Ukampis jupax ukham luraspa ukhaxa, chiqpachansa wali askïspawa.

Just the coffee.	Ukhama uka café.
Everything is very fast.	Taqi kunas wali jaya.

You have to do it, of course.	Jumax lurañamawa, chiqpachansa.

He’s hungry right now.	Jupax jichhax manq’at awtjataw jikxatasi.
No, not today.	Janiwa, janiw jichhürunakanxa.
But he knew what it was.	Ukampis kunas uk sum yatïna.
This process can take years.	Ukham lurañax walja maranakaw munasispa.
So, you know, he’s already going in the morning.	Ukhama, jumax yatisktawa, jupax niya alwaw saraski.
But that doesn't seem to work.	Ukampis ukajj janiw askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
You have all day tomorrow.	Jumax qhipürux taqpach uruw jikxatasïta.

He didn't agree with everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kunsa iyaw siskänti.
He doesn’t know any other way.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit yatkiti.
Maybe no one knows why.	Inas jan khitis kunatsa uk yatkchiti.

Eventually, he feels better.	Qhepatjja, jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasi.

But he didn't do all that much.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kunas mä jukʼa lurkänti.
And he told me he wouldn't.	Ukat janiw ukham lurkäti sasaw sitäna.
He didn't want to talk about it in detail.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum parlañ munkänti.

The first day of the meeting came early.	Tantachäwin nayrïr urux wali alwat purinïna.
He loved her more than he loved himself.	Jupa pachpat sipansa jukʼampiw jupar munasïna.
It’s definitely better!.	Chiqpachansa juk’ampi sumawa!.
Everyone likes it.	Taqiniruw gusti.
He does stuff like that all the time.	Jupax sapa kutiw ukham lurañanak luraski.
Which, in a strange way.	Ukax, mä muspharkañawa.
Now I didn't know any better.	Jichhajj janiw jukʼamp sum yatkayätti.
That was the time.	Uka tiempojj ukhamänwa.
Well, it really can’t exist.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa janiw utjkaspati.
They just exist.	Jupanakax ukhamakiw utji.
I need help with this.	Uka toqet yanaptʼa munasispa.
He welcomed her with a warm welcome.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw jupar katoqäna.
I don't need it anymore.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
They’re literally everywhere.	Jupanakax chiqpachapuniw taqi chiqan utji.
That’s how it will be with anyone.	Ukhamaw khitimpis utjani.
This month .	Aka phaxsinx .
There is certainly room for improvement there.	Chiqansa, ukanx jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
Which he refused to do.	Uk jupajj janiw sasaw säna.
It’s once you know it properly, you know everything.	Ukax mä kutix sum uñt’atawa, taqi kunas uñt’atawa.
This really surprises me.	Chiqpachansa akax nayatakix muspharkañawa.
I don't have any of that.	Nayajj janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkituti.
And here, he does it well.	Ukat akax, jupax wali sumwa.
I can't think of anything better.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp suma amuytʼirjamäkti.
It looks really amazing.	Chiqpachansa muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
There's nothing to hurry up.	Janiw kunas jank'ak lurañax utjkiti.
I’d love to have dinner with you.	Nayax jumamp chika manq’añax wali kusiskañawa.
I mean both at the same time.	Nayax panpachaniw pachpa pachan sañ munta.
Anything that matters to you.	Kunatï jumatak wakiski ukajja.
There is a good place to avoid this.	Ukham jan lurañatakix mä suma chiqaw utji.
And the day before.	Ukat uka uru nayra.
He sped away with great force.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw jankʼak sarjjäna.
Tomorrow will be a much shorter day.	Qhipürux mä juk’a jisk’a uruw utjani.
But at this point, that doesn't matter.	Ukampis aka tiemponjja, janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
It doesn’t mean there’s nothing to do right now.	Janiw jichhax kuna lurañas utjkiti sañ munkiti.
We’ll do that, somehow.	Jiwasax ukham lurañäni, kunjamatsa.
I don’t do them much.	Janiw jupanakar wal lurkti.
But now .	Ukampis jichhajj .
These things happened a year ago.	Ukanakax mä mara nayraw pasäna.
He could do whatever he wanted there.	Ukanjja, kuntï munkäna uk luraspänwa.
Now there’s a chance.	Jichhax mä ch’amaw utji.
Let’s be honest here.	Aka chiqanx chiqapar uñjañäni.
No, he didn't do anything.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
He was so glad there was no one around.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna, janiw khitis uka jak’an utjkänti.
I thought that was really good.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
It all means the same thing.	Taqi kunas mä pachpa sañ muni.
I just want to talk to you.	Nayajj jumamp sapakiw parltʼañ munta.
It’s going badly.	Ukax jan waliw saraski.
But it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis janiw kuntï munkäna ukhamäkänti.
I went to school with him.	Jupampiw escuelar sarawayta.
He has that look about him.	Jupax jupat ukham uñnaqaniwa.
Time takes time.	Tiempojj tiempow munasispa.
I was at the time, too.	Nayajj uka tiemponjja, ukhamaraki.
It took them a while for that.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow jupanakajj pasäna.
That will take a day or so.	Ukatakejj mä uru jan ukajj mä uruw pasani.
What happened here happened a while ago.	Kunatï akan paskäna ukajj mä jukʼa tiempo nayraw pasäna.
The night before the last day.	Arumax janïr qhipa uru.
The night spoke to him.	Arumax juparux arsüna.
Eventually, one or the other can happen.	Qhepatjja, mä jan ukajj mayniw pasaspa.
And now it doesn’t matter.	Ukat jichhax janiw kunäkisa.
Money is known as money.	Qullqix qullqi uñt’atawa.
I’m looking forward to drinking.	Nayax umañ wal suyaskta.
It has nothing to do with me.	Janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He thinks he’s too good for that.	Jupax ukatakix wali sumaw sasaw amuyi.
It doesn't know anything.	Ukajj janiw kunsa yatkiti.
And it’s beautiful, indeed.	Ukat wali sumawa, chiqpachansa.
So you don't want to admit it to yourself.	Ukhamajj janiw juma pachpajj uk iyaw sañ munktati.
Anyway, you better be.	Kawkhansa, jumax juk’amp askiwa.
There are a couple of times.	Ukax mä pä kutiw utji.
The crowd .	Uka walja jaqenakajj .
But as he did nothing.	Ukampis kunjamtï jupajj jan kuns lurkäna ukhama.
They are like .	Jupanakax kunjamtï .
He does almost everything well.	Niya taqe kunsa sumwa luraski.
Really good indeed.	Chiqpachansa wali suma chiqpachansa.
This can happen a lot.	Ukajj walpun pasaspa.
It was the way he looked at her.	Ukajj kunjamsa jupar uñchʼukiskäna ukawa.
I have a little problem.	Nayax mä jisk’a jan walt’äwin jikxatastxa.
I’m pretty excited, actually.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
He declined to comment on how long it would last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasani uka toqet janiw kuns arskänti.
Here are some of the.	Akax mä qawqha...
He said there would be another time.	Yaqha pachaw utjani sasaw säna.
He’s in the park.	Jupax parkin jikxatasi.
I love that about it.	Nayax uka tuqit walpun munta.
I can do it, he repeats.	Nayax uk lurasmati, sasaw wasitat saraki.
He kind of wanted to do it alone.	Jupax mä juk’a sapak lurañ munäna.
But he saw something in her.	Ukampis jupajj kunsa jupar uñjäna.
You know that, of course.	Jumax uk yatisktawa, chiqpachansa.
It is so lovely to see.	Ukhamajj wali munasiñampiw uñjasi.
I don’t know what to do from here.	Janiw nayax aka chiqat kuns lurañ yatkti.
That was what he wanted more than anything.	Ukaw jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp munäna.
That here they are.	Ukax akanx jupanakax.
A little .	Mä jukʼa .
Wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly.	Taqi chuyma, taqi chuyma.
He sucked in the air again.	Jupax wasitatwa thaya chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
But he knows that's okay.	Ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa uk jupajj sum yati.
I want to sleep there.	Nayax ukan ikiñ munta.
He spoke of her one morning.	Mä alwaw jupat parläna.
He can’t stand it anymore.	Jupax janiw juk’amp aguantañjamäkiti.
He welcomed him immediately.	Jupar jankʼakiw katoqäna.
The process is very difficult.	Uka lurañax wali ch’amawa.
No one there now.	Janiw khitis ukan jichhax utjkiti.
He couldn't stop drinking.	Jupajj janiw umañ jaytañ puedkänti.
The more obvious the lower the price.	Ukax juk’amp qhanaw juk’amp jisk’a qullqix.
I started it all.	Nayax taqi ukanak qalltawayta.
But this is now seen as impossible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti sasaw jichhajj uñjasi.
But he doesn’t care, not really.	Ukampis jupax janiw kuns amuykiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
I still didn’t understand.	Wali jan amuykayätti.
He really got there.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheqar purinïna.
And you can do whatever you want.	Ukat kuntï munkta uk lurasma.
It’s something all the same.	Ukax mä kunaw taqpach pachpa.
The man knew exactly what he had to do.	Uka jaqejj kunsa lurañapa uk sum yatïna.
I still maybe one day.	Nayax wali inas mä urux.
He could do whatever he wanted with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw kuntï munkäna uk luraspäna.
This is very obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw amuyasi.
There was very little there.	Ukanjja, wali jukʼakiw utjäna.
There’s always someone better.	Sapa kutiw maynix juk’amp suma jikxatasi.
And he kind of likes it.	Ukat juparux mä jukʼa gusti.
He didn't do all of that.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanak lurkänti.
You really need to do something about it.	Uka tuqitxa chiqpachansa kuns lurañaw wakisi.
Then he went back to bed.	Ukat wasitat ikiñar sarxäna.
Finally, he could do nothing.	Qhepatjja, janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.
I wonder what he sees there.	Kunsa ukan uñji sasaw jisktʼasta.
And as .	Ukat kunjamtï .
I mean .	Sañ munta .
What he didn't want to know.	Kuntï jupajj jan yatiñ munkäna ukawa.
It looks good, too.	Ukax wali sumaw uñtasi, ukhamaraki.
But now there is nothing there.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
That’s very important to me.	Ukax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
It really seemed impossible.	Chiqpachansa, jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I’ve never seen anyone like him.	Janipuniw jupar uñtasit khitirus uñjkti.
I feel really bad about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatastxa.
He wanted that, he realized.	Jupajj ukham munäna, sasaw amuyasïna.
You don’t want to leave me.	Jumax janiw nayar jaytañ munktati.
He’s such a person.	Jupax ukham jaqiwa.
He knew who he was now.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
He was asleep for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ikiskäna.
There is a lot of value in doing so.	Ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
In fact, that is exactly what it is.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
I’m still in love with it.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw uka tuqitxa.
You have to do something.	Jumax kuns lurañamawa.
No it doesn’t exist.	Janiwa janiwa utjkiti.
He already knows, after all.	Jupax niyaw yati, taqi kunat sipansa.
Well, it was	Ukhama, wali .
He said he still liked me.	Jupajj waliw nayar munta sasaw säna.
He felt the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw amuyäna.
But one day we will.	Ukampis mä uruw ukham lurañäni.
I want something to happen.	Nayajj kunas pasañap munta.
I want to leave him.	Jupar jaytañ munta.
And he was very surprised.	Ukat jupajj walpun muspharäna.
That's what he knew now.	Ukhamwa jichhajj yatïna.
I’m a foreigner.	Nayax yaqha markankir jaqïtwa.
As much as he can do.	Kunjamtï jupax lurañjamäki ukhama.
A good many indeed it is.	Mä suma walja chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
It’s, well, very nice.	Ukaxa, wali, wali sumawa.
It doesn’t exist and it doesn’t.	Ukax janiw utjkiti ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
And now this .	Ukat jichhax aka .
He can’t do it again.	Janiw mayampsa uk lurkaspati.
He told her not to do anything.	Kunas jan luramti sasaw säna.
He thought it was a good day.	Uka urux wali suma uruw sasaw amuyäna.
It was his only wholeheartedness.	Ukajj jupatak mä sapa taqe chuymaw utjäna.
A very interesting and interesting film .	Mä wali suma ukat wali suma película .
He did nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kuns lurkänti.
I never believed that.	Nayajj janipuniw uk creykti.
Or do something about it.	Jan ukax kuns lurañaw wakisi.
Let’s do what you want to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkta uk lurañäni.
Well, you know why.	Ukhamajj kunatsa uk yatisktawa.
No, there was no problem.	Janiwa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Which nobody noticed.	Ukax janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
I don't know what to do now.	Jichhajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
If this is needed again.	Ukax wasitat wakisispa ukhaxa.
But it doesn’t do him nothing.	Ukampis janiw jupar jan kuns lurkiti.
I thought these were beautiful.	Ukanakajj wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.
I fell in love with her immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw jupar munasta.
He loves to give.	Jupajj churañ wal muni.
I’m not sure how to go about this.	Nayax janiw kunjams aka tuqit sarañax ukx yatkti.
This has been a good week.	Akax mä suma semanaw utjawayi.
I wasn’t really expecting anyone.	Janiw chiqpachansa khitirus suykayätti.
I don’t want to see that happen.	Janiw ukham lurasiñap uñjañ munkti.
You’ll feel alone.	Jumax sapakiw jikxatasïta.
This was obvious to me.	Akax nayatakix qhanaw amuyasïna.
As big as you want it to be.	Kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhama jach’a.
That’s a lovely character.	Ukax mä munat jaqiwa.
It’s exciting and exciting and challenging.	Ukax wali kusiskañawa ukat wali kusiskañawa ukat ch’amawa.
I never knew what to make of him.	Janipuniw kunsa jupat lurañax uk yatkti.
I don’t want to give up.	Janiw jaytañ munkti.
The atmosphere feels good.	Uka pachax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
It’s amazing how everything happens at night.	Kunjamsa arumax taqi kunas pasaski ukax muspharkañawa.
But he told her.	Ukampis jupajj jupar sänwa.
But everything is still clear.	Ukampis taqe kunas wali qhanawa.
That was the last time he saw me.	Ukaw qhep qhepa kuti nayar uñjäna.
He thought this was hilarious.	Jupax akax wali kusiskañawa sasaw amuyäna.
It feels like that .	Ukax ukham jikxatasi .
Right now it’s available.	Jichhakiw utji.
Last night, he was asleep.	Qhipa arumax, jupax ikiskäna.
He was thin, thin, thin.	Jupajj jiskʼa jaqënwa, jiskʼa jaqënwa, jiskʼa jaqënwa.
He knows it, and he is devastated.	Jupajj uk sum yati, ukat wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
But so far, nothing, absolutely nothing.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw kunas utjkiti, janipuniw kunas utjkiti.
I was hoping that would happen.	Nayajj ukham lurañwa suykayäta.
He does it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk luri.
He wanted it, still.	Jupax munäna, wali.
These are very clear.	Ukanakax wali qhanawa.
He is really short .	Jupax chiqpachansa jiskʼa jaqiwa .
You are a man of justice.	Jumax chiqapar uñjir jaqiwa.
So now that was it.	Ukhamajj jichhajj ukhamänwa.
And this is not what you want.	Ukat akax janiw kuntï munkta ukhamäkiti.
It wasn't that he didn't know what to do.	Janiw kun lurañsa jan sum yatkänti.
He rarely talked about money.	Jupajj jukʼakiw qollqe toqet parläna.
This may not be possible.	Ukax inas jan lurañjamäkiti.
So it's a little more exciting.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
I think he would be the best there.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali sumaw ukanx utjaspa.
I can’t say exactly what, or when.	Janiw kunas, jan ukax kunapachas ukx sum sañjamäkiti.
That ended up being my responsibility.	Ukaw nayan lurañajatak tukuyäna.
That's when.	Ukax kunapachas.
He wanted something bigger.	Jupajj jukʼamp jachʼa kunsa munäna.
She thought that was pretty cool.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He really, really needed it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw, chiqpachansa ukax munasïna.
Nobody understands this stuff.	Janiw khitis uka yänak amuykiti.
I see how it is now.	Kunjamsa jichhajj utji uk uñjta.
Small, actually smaller.	Jisk’a, chiqpachansa juk’ampi jisk’a.
I didn’t say his name.	Janiw sutip siskti.
We all need to do this more.	Taqeniw uk jukʼamp lurañasa.
He needs to do better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurañapa.
He struck again.	Jupax wasitat ch’allt’äna.
He was eager to talk to her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
He just went so fast, that’s all.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali jaya saräna, ukakiw.
I love it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk wal munasta.
He didn’t know where to go.	Jupax janiw kawkirus sarañ yatkänti.
It definitely didn’t feel like it, but maybe .	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham amuyaskänti, ukampis inas .
He said it, but he didn't really mean it.	Jupajj uk sänwa, ukampis janiw cheqpachapun uk sañ munkänti.
Everyone needs it.	Taqeniw ukajj wakisi.
I’ve been inside for a long time.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw manqhan jikxatastxa.
He’s the one who has to do it.	Jupaw uk lurañapa.
That’s all we have to do for now.	Jichhakamax ukakiw lurañasa.
And that actually took a few years.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax mä qawqha maranakaw munasïna.
No one really knows what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk janiw khitis cheqpachapun yatkiti.
But he sees no other option.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti sasaw jupajj uñji.
You know, it’s been a tough year.	Jumax yatisktawa, mä ch’am maraw utjawayi.
There is no need to do these things.	Janipuniw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
He wanted to tell her that it didn't matter.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw jupar sañ munäna.
Well, that’s weird.	Ukhama, ukax muspharkañawa.
But I don't know what that could be.	Ukampis ukajj kunas utjaspa uk janiw yatkti.
No one does it now.	Jichhajj janiw khitis uk lurkiti.
More like a brand, really.	Mä markar uñtasit juk’ampi, chiqpachansa.
The afternoon was short.	Tardejj mä jukʼa tiempow utjäna.
I just saw this movie today.	Jichhürunakanx jichhakiw aka película uñjta.
Not so much, it seems.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, ukhamwa amuyasi.
Everything is pretty obvious after all.	Taqi kunas wali qhanaw taqi kunat sipansa.
No one knew about it.	Janiw khitis yatkänti.
But he was a bad guy.	Ukampis jupajj jan wali jaqënwa.
This made him happier.	Ukham lurasajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I want to live a lot.	Nayax walpun jakañ munta.
He knew what he wanted from her.	Jupajj kunsa jupat munäna uk sum yatïna.
The man did not give his name.	Uka jaqejj janiw sutip arskänti.
He’s a villain, he seems old.	Jupax mä jan wali jaqiwa, chuymanïkaspas ukhamawa.
Because it’s not really like that.	Kunatix janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
He is more depressed.	Jupajj jukʼamp llakitaw jikjjatasi.
This doesn't work without it.	Akax jan ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
He has to make the bed.	Jupaw ikiñ lurañapa.
I’ve had this for years.	Nayax walja maranakaw ukham jikxatastxa.
He was happy there.	Jupajj ukan kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I never wanted to come here.	Janipuniw akan jutañ munkti.
I don’t have the time.	Nayax janiw kuna pachas utjkituti.

Very quick now.	Wali jank’akiw jichhax.
He looks like that.	Jupax ukham uñnaqaniwa.
He didn't mean that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak sañ munkänti.
Honestly, it’s a fantastic university.	Chiqpachansa, mä jach’a yatiqañ utax wali muspharkañawa.
I don't know	Nayax janiw .
You know, that’s all right.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.

And now they know.	Ukat jichhax yatipxi.
Bad, or bad.	Jan wali, jan ukax jan wali.

He has to do something.	Kuns lurañapawa.
You thank me for it.	Jumax nayaruw yuspärta.

He was very welcoming.	Jupajj wali sum katoqäna.
He thought he would never do that.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham lurkaniti sasaw amuyäna.

I decided to do that.	Ukham lurañ amtawayta.

I’m very curious about it.	Nayax uka tuqit walpun yatxatañ munta.
I refuse to give them permission.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar permiso churañ munkti.
I think he’s a really nice guy.	Nayax amuyta, jupax chiqpachansa wali suma jaqiwa.
And now it comes to me.	Ukat jichhax nayaruw puri.
Husband decided to give it to me.	Chachax nayaruw uka qullqi churañ amtäna.
He said he didn’t have enough money.	Jupax janiw qullqix utjkiti sasaw säna.
You don’t want to work in the wrong place.	Janiw jan wali chiqan irnaqañ munktati.
So it can happen as well.	Ukhamajj ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
He didn't know who it was.	Jupajj khitis uk janiw yatkänti.
But you can’t do that, of course.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Now one more thing and this is very important.	Jichhax mä juk’ampi ukat akax wali wakiskiriwa.
Of course tonight.	Chiqansa jichha arumax.
Let’s be honest about it.	Uka tuqit chiqapar uñjañäni.
You don’t have to do that .	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti .
He had no idea how long he had been asleep.	Qhawqha tiempos ikiskäna uk janiw amuykänti.
New year, new me.	Machaq mara, machaq naya.
I’ve been there for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw ukanx jikxatastxa.

That’s good, at least.	Ukax wali askiwa, mä juk’a.
And so cruel.	Ukat ukhama qhuru.
It’s silently there.	Ukax amukiw ukan utji.
The real, whatever that might be, doesn’t exist.	Chiqpach, kunas ukax utjaspa, janiw utjkiti.
And he didn't like them.	Ukat jupajj janiw jupanakar gustkänti.
Or maybe he wanted to give it time.	Jan ukajj inas tiempo churañ munpachäna.
Same otherwise.	Pachpa yaqha tuqitxa.
But somehow he doesn’t.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now he could really play.	Jichhax chiqpachapuniw anattʼañ yatïna.
We didn’t have anything.	Jiwasax janiw kunas utjkänti.

After that, it happened quickly.	Uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw pasäna.
Maybe you should go the other way.	Inas yaqha tuqit sarañax wakischispa.
Just one,’ he says.	Mä sapakiw’ sasaw saraki.
That’s how he is.	Ukhamaw jupax.
I don't know exactly what he's going to do.	Kunsa lurani uk janiw sum yatkti.

So, this is pretty cool.	Ukhama, akax wali ch’amawa.
But I never did that.	Ukampis janipuniw uk lurkti.
And they gave them permission.	Ukat jupanakajj jupanakar permiso churäna.
He came from nowhere .	Jupajj jan kawkitsa jutäna .
Dinner won’t last long.	Manq’añax janiw jaya pachax utjkaniti.
Don't forget to eat something.	Janiw kuns manq'añ armasimti.
He really means well.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sum sañ muni.
I don’t remember, but .	Nayax janiw amtaskti, ukampis .
It was all or nothing for me.	Nayatakejj taqe kunas jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
He himself didn't know exactly what it was.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kunas uk sum yatkänti.
So it can't be done right now.	Ukhamajj janiw jichhajj lurañjamäkiti.
I appreciate that much about him.	Jupat ukham walpun wali askit uñjta.
So he doesn't care.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj kuns lurkiti.
But we need to do more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw lurañasa.
Yes, it really is.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
It doesn’t matter when.	Kunapachas ukax janiw kunäkisa.
It took a day for this.	Ukatakejj mä uruw munasïna.
He felt particularly stubborn.	Jupajj jukʼampiw qala chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
I didn't need that today.	Jichhürojj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
It takes about three days.	Ukax niya kimsa uruw wakisi.
That just happened to me.	Ukax nayatakix ukhamakiw pasäna.
I don’t say anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans siskti.
They didn't need to do that.	Jupanakajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
It’s really exciting.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali kusiskañawa.
No, not at all, she said.	Janiwa, janiw ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupajj säna.
Let’s do the work here.	Akan lurañanak lurañäni.
This is another one of these.	Akax yaqha ukham uñt’atawa.
But thankfully, that is very rare.	Ukampis ukajj wali jukʼakiw utji, ukajj walpun yuspärta.
Very happy to be here.	Wali kusisitaw akanx jikxatasi.
This is especially true of late.	Ukajj qhepa tiemponjja, jukʼampiw uñjasi.
I didn't know anything about him.	Janiw nayajj jupat kuns yatkayätti.
There is plenty of time later for that.	Ukatakejj qhepat walja tiempow utji.
She knew what he was thinking.	Jupajj kunsa jupajj amuyäna uk sum yatïna.
Wherever there is evil, there is he.	Kawkhantï jan wali lurañajj utjki ukanjja, jupaw utji.
Or so it seemed at the time.	Jan ukajj uka tiemponjja ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
You know, everywhere, and big.	Jumax yatisktawa, taqi chiqan, ukat jach’a.
He has that look.	Jupajj uka uñnaqaniwa.
He’s really amazing to me.	Chiqpachansa jupax nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.
I was surprised to hear how he was.	Jupan kunjamsa uk istʼasajj wal muspharta.
Or a brewery.	Jan ukajj mä cerveza lurañ uta.
Of course, he’s human.	Chiqansa, jupax jaqiwa.
It’s obvious where the money is.	Ukax qhanaw kawkhans qullqix utji.
It was kind of nice.	Mä jukʼa sumapunïnwa.
No, actually two.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa pä.
He was when he .	Jupajj kunapachatï .
Now that’s all weird.	Jichhax ukax taqpach muspharkañawa.
That happened a few days ago.	Ukajj mä qhawqha urunak nayraw pasäna.
He decided he wanted to live.	Jupax jakañ munta sasaw amtäna.
For one thing, there was no problem.	Mä tuqitxa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
It was very cold as well.	Wali thaya ukhamaraki.
We don’t, not really.	Jiwasax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
That’s what I decided to do.	Ukatakix nayax amtawayta.
Now there was nothing.	Jichhajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
Now that’s already pretty cool.	Jichhax ukax niyaw wali ch’amawa.
He started talking to me one day.	Jupajj mä uruw nayamp parltʼañ qalltäna.
One wondered how this could happen.	Mä jaqejj kunjamatsa ukham pasaspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
The question was how to do it.	Uka jisktʼajj kunjamatsa uk lurañaw utjäna.
I thought that was weird.	Nayajj ukajj muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Many people are beautiful.	Walja jaqenakajj wali sumawa.
You have a lot of hours.	Jumax walja horanakaw utji.
It almost always happened.	Niya sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
He said he didn’t do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.
And he didn't mean it.	Ukat janiw uk sañ munkänti.
It was bad and wonderful.	Ukajj jan wali ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
You know he knew it.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax uk yatïna.
And he’s an adult.	Ukat jupax jilïr jaqiwa.
And beyond me.	Ukat nayat sipansa.
Nobody does anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqitx kuns lurkiti.
I’m doing that here.	Nayax akan ukham luraskta.
He was a real bully.	Jupajj cheqpach jan walinak parlir jaqënwa.
But that doesn’t mean one will actually exist.	Ukampis janiw maynix chiqpachapuni utjani sañ munkiti.
It happened last week.	Pasïr semanan ukhamarakiw pasäna.
The process took two years.	Uka lurañatakejj pä maraw munasïna.
It happened for no reason and everything.	Jan kunatsa ukat taqe kunatsa ukham pasäna.
He came home safely.	Jupajj jan kunas paskäna ukhaw utar purinïna.
Lovely living space and a very comfortable bedroom.	Munat jakañ uta ukat mä suma suma ikiñ uta.
This is who he was.	Akax khitïnsa ukxa.
He outlived her.	Jupat sipansa jukʼampiw jakasïna.
But one thing is always there.	Ukampis mä kunaw sapa kuti utji.
So he was, unlike me.	Ukhamajj jupajj ukhamänwa, nayat sipansa.
Nothing is worth doing.	Janiw kuna lurañas askïkiti.
I was shocked to see that.	Uk uñjasajj walpun muspharta.
Now something different was needed.	Jichhajj yaqha kasta lurañaw wakisïna.
I did it all for the sake of it.	Nayax taqi ukanak lurañatakiw ukham lurayäta.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He called the same giant.	Jupax pachpa jach’a jaqiruw jawsäna.
No, that's not necessary.	Janiwa, ukajj janiw wakiskiti.
He left his house.	Jupajj utapat sarjjäna.
I know he’s tough.	Nayax yattwa jupax wali ch’amawa.
Yes, there is the unhappy part.	Jïsa, jan kusisit chiqaw utji.
Very nice, too.	Wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
Not for me though.	Janiw nayatakix ukampis.
But that is a minority.	Ukampis ukajj mä jiskʼa jaqewa.
It’s kind of weird to do that.	Ukham lurañax mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
I don't know much about him myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw jupat wal yatkti.
It worked immediately.	Ukax jank’akiw irnaqäna.
Absolutely, but it makes no sense in the current context.	Chiqpachansa, ukampis jichha pachan utjki uka tuqitxa janiw kunäkisa.
He lives well every day.	Jupax sapa uruw sum jakasi.
No money, no money.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti, janiw qullqix utjkiti.
Instead, he did it himself.	Jan ukasti jupaw ukanak luratayna.
Nothing is impossible.	Janiw kunas jan lurañjamäkiti.
That could be another possibility.	Ukajj yaqha lurañaw utjaspa.
Then something terrible happened.	Ukat mä jan waliw pasäna.
Of course, he does nothing about it.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurkiti.
I know what is coming next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk yattwa.
You know, nobody wanted to do that.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw khitis ukham lurañ munkänti.
He was quick to talk about it.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka toqet parläna.
Of course, he doesn’t know much.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw sinti yatkiti.
He thought he was a good man.	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
Quietly, of course.	Amukiw, chiqpachansa.
I don’t want to see you again.	Janiw mayamps jumar uñjañ munkti.
And he did it himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
Why was he afraid.	Kunatsa ajjsaräna.
Now that was pretty cool.	Jichhajj ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
That’s how it is in a small town.	Ukhamaw mä jisk’a markanx utji.
This is the time for me.	Aka pachax nayatakix wali askiwa.
How can a person	Kunjamsa mä jaqejj .
Of course, there was a place.	Chiqansa, mä chiqaw utjäna.
Actually, let’s look at what we have now.	Chiqansa, kunanakas jichhax utjistu uk uñjañäni.
But, obviously, that wasn’t the case.	Ukampis, qhanaw amuyasi, janiw ukhamäkänti.
So no, there was no such problem.	Ukhamajj janiw, janiw ukham jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
You really don’t need to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
I hope it will be good.	Nayax wali sumaw utjani sasaw suyt’askta.
He could not speak for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
I’ve never had a chance.	Nayax janipuniw mä ch’am jikxatkti.
He was already dreading the day.	Jupajj niyaw uka uru ajjsaräna.
And you knew nothing.	Ukat janiw kuns yatkayätati.
Of course, what happened next was the problem.	Chiqansa, kunatï uka qhepat paskäna ukanakaw jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
That’s the other place.	Uka yaqha chiqa.
We are glad your very much.	Jiwasax wali kusisitaw jumanakan wali jach’a.

Yes, but how? 	Jïsa, ukampis ¿kunjamatsa?
We drove for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempow autot sarapjjta.
It can take a week.	Mä semanaw pasaspa.
He never understood the present.	Jupajj janipuniw jichha tiempon utjki ukanak amuykänti.

I don’t know what to say to anyone.	Janiw khitirus kuns sañ yatkti.
So nice and big.	Ukhama suma ukat jach’a.
I’ve already said that.	Nayax nayratpach ukham sista.
He’s a little unusual.	Jupax mä juk’a jan uñt’atawa.
They weren’t individuals.	Jupanakax janiw sapa maynix utjkänti.
Let me know what you need!.	¡Kunanakas jumatakix wakisi uk yatiyapxita!.
I’m, you know, very excited.	Nayax, jumax yatisktawa, wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
It’s this kind of person.	Ukax aka kasta jaqiwa.

It may take a few hours.	Inas mä qawqha horanak sarañax wakischispa.
For me, it’s the same.	Nayatakix ukhamaraki.
I don’t see anyone.	Janiw khitis uñjkti.
Let’s do what’s necessary.	Kuntï wakiski uk lurañäni.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Someone told them.	Mayniw jupanakar yatiyäna.
The future was clear.	Jutïr tiempojj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I’m better off.	Nayax juk’amp askiwa.
Well thank you very much.	Suma walpun yuspärta.
I didn't know how to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañ yatkayätti.
I decided to enter.	Nayax mantañ amtawayta.
I don’t want to sleep anymore.	Janiw juk’ampi ikiñ munkti.
You will be pleasantly surprised!.	¡Jumax wali kusisitaw muspharta!.
I just wanted to ride.	Nayax ukhamakiw kayuk sarañ munta.
All the snowflakes.	Taqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
No, we won't have it.	Janiwa, janiw jiwasajj utjkaniti.
And it’s kind of fun.	Ukat mä juk’a kusiskañawa.
He didn’t make who he was.	Janiw khitïnsa uk lurkänti.
He needed some coffee.	Jupajj mä jukʼa café munasïna.
I hope he does as well or better.	Jupax ukhamarakiw jan ukax juk’amp sum lurani sasaw suyt’askta.
In fact, he did just that.	Chiqansa, jupax ukhamarakiw luräna.
That was the only thing he got.	Uka sapakiw jupajj katoqäna.
We didn’t have to do that, you know.	Janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti, jumax yatisktawa.
When it goes, it goes pretty fast.	Kunapachatï ukax sarxi ukhaxa, wali jankʼakiw sarxi.
I want to explore the area.	Nayax uka chiqat yatxatañ munta.
I drink too much coffee.	Nayax sinti café umañ yatta.
And someone appreciated it.	Ukat maynix uk wali askit uñjäna.
Everyone should go there.	Taqinipuniw uka chiqar sarañapa.
He’s a very secretive person.	Jupax wali jamasat jaqiwa.
He’s very tough as well.	Jupax wali ch’amawa ukhamaraki.
There was quite a bit of activity.	Ukanjja, mä jukʼa lurañaw utjäna.
I’m very happy to be here.	Nayax wali kusisitaw akan jikxatasiyäta.
And of course, that’s good.	Ukat chiqansa, ukax wali askiwa.
Actually, I don't think that's the case.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
Well, well, another day.	Ukhama, wali, yaqha uru.
So he walked a little faster.	Ukatwa mä jukʼa jankʼak sarnaqäna.
That in itself is not a bad thing.	Uka pachpajj janiw jan walïkiti.
Not that the task is impossible.	Janiw uka lurañajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamäkiti.
The timing is not ideal.	Uka tiempojj janiw wali askïkiti.
A few days after that, he called again.	Uka qhepat mä qhawqha urunak qhepatjja, wasitatwa jawsäna.
He was completely indifferent.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jan kuns lurañ munkänti.
Another snowflake.	Yaqha ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I have heard it myself.	Naya pachpaw uka arunak istʼta.
This could be the place.	Akax uka chiqaw utjaspa.
You are old enough for me.	Jumax nayatakix jilïr jaqïtawa.
Too soon, in fact.	Sinti jank’akiw, chiqpachansa.
I can't do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurirjamäkti.
I kind of let that go.	Nayax mä juk’a ukanak jaytawayta.
And surprisingly, there was nothing wrong with it.	Ukat muspharkañawa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis ukan utjkänti.
They don’t know how to do that.	Jupanakax janiw ukanak lurañ yatipkiti.
But you need half a day .	Ukampis chika uruw munasispa .
And so there will be more.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jukʼampiw utjani.
I saw this movie tonight.	Jichha arumax aka película uñjta.
It was a little out of shape.	Ukajj mä jukʼa jan uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But, it’s a good one.	Ukampis, mä suma.
And there is a lot of truth to that.	Ukat uka tuqitxa walja chiqaw utji.

I was shocked to see him.	Nayajj jupar uñjasajj wal muspharta.

I felt pretty good about eating breakfast.	Nayax desayuno manq’añ tuqitx wali sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
There was some work to be done.	Mä jukʼa lurañaw utjäna.
He has to do it now.	Jupax jichhax lurañapawa.
You miss him so much.	Jumax juparux walpun llakista.
No, do it now.	Janiwa, jichhajj luram.
I tell him that every week.	Sapa semanaw ukham jupar sista.
But that is not the case with me.	Ukampis janiw ukajj nayatakejj ukhamäkiti.
I’m still alone here, you know.	Nayax wali sapakiw akan jikxatastxa, jumax yatisktawa.
Here, you better this.	Akax, jumax akax juk’amp askiwa.
Not snowflakes.	Janiw ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But it’s not realistic.	Ukampis janiw cheqpach ukhamäkiti.
It is the largest and most prestigious university in the country.	Ukax jach’a ukat wali uñt’at jach’a yatiqañ utan uñt’atawa.
That's all you want to do.	Ukakiw jumajj lurañ munta.
But that’s, kind of, cool.	Ukampis ukax, mä kasta, wali sumawa.

Things were much better back then.	Uka tiemponjja, kunas jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
It will also last a long time.	Ukhamaraki jaya pachaw utjani.
It felt uncomfortable.	Ukajj jan waliw jikjjatasïna.
He refused to help.	Jupajj janiw yanaptʼañ munkänti.
I had never had anything like this before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham lurañajj utjkitänti.
And the bottom line is, there was no money.	Ukat ukax akham sañ muni, janiw qullqix utjkänti.
He couldn’t afford a beer.	Jupax janiw mä cerveza alañ puedkänti.
I’m looking forward to going with him.	Nayax jupamp chika sarañ suyt’askta.
They can’t do nothing during the day.	Jupanakax janiw urux jan kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Well, he’s good, too.	Ukhama, jupax wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
You’re in worse shape.	Jumax juk’amp jan walin jikxatastaxa.

But he was right.	Ukampis jupajj cheq parläna.

Nothing goes, really.	Janiw kunas sarkiti, chiqpachansa.

A little more, but no more.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi, ukampis janiw juk’ampi.
In fact, he loves doing it.	Chiqansa, uka lurañax juparux walpun gusti.
Well, so and so.	Ukhama, ukhama ukhamaraki.
And you can’t make a film without it.	Ukat jan ukax janiw mä película lurañjamäkiti.
I never thought it would happen.	Janipuniw ukham pasaspa sasin amuyirïkti.
There is something very, very wrong.	Kuna wali, wali jan waliw utji.
It was never the first time.	Janipuniw nayrïr kuti ukhamäkänti.
He was already coming.	Jupajj niyaw jutäna.
That’s what one of them thought.	Ukhamaw maynix amuyäna.
Everything about the area is very bad economically.	Taqi kunas qullqi tuqitx uka chiqanx wali jan waliw uñjasi.
But he doesn’t do anything alone.	Ukampis janiw sapakix kuns lurkiti.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet parltʼañ munkiti.
You don’t want to be alone.	Janiw juma sapaki sarnaqañ munktati.
It’s almost time for lunch.	Niya chika uru manq’añ pachaw purini.
The same can happen in the aftermath of such a tragedy.	Ukham jan walinak utjki uka qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
I don’t want to say anything about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx kuns sañ munkti.
He remembered that he was a good man.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa sasaw amtäna.
He wanted what you wanted.	Jupajj kuntï jumajj munkayäta uk munäna.
There is never enough money.	Janipuniw qullqix utjkiti.

Well this is kind of important.	Suma akax mä juk’a wakiskiriwa.

Tonight is very important.	Jichha arumax wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s what you’re used to seeing.	Ukax kuntix jumax uñjañ yatkta ukawa.
There will never be such people.	Janipuniw ukham jaqinakax utjkaniti.
He sat quietly, staring at me.	Jupajj amukiw qontʼasïna, nayaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
He did, and repeated.	Uk luräna, ukat mayamp arsüna.
There is no real urgency.	Janiw chiqpach jankʼak lurañax utjkiti.
The point is, it's never as bad as you think.	Uka tuqitxa, janipuniw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukham jan walïkiti.
He will one day.	Jupajj mä uruw ukham lurani.
But I understood what he meant.	Ukampis kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum amuyayäta.
He was totally satisfied that he was fine.	Jupax taqi chuymaw jikxatasïna, walikïskiwa.
I want him bad enough.	Nayax juparux jan waliw munta.
He really loved it.	Chiqpachansa jupax walpun munasïna.

It felt like a great night.	Mä jachʼa arumaw amuyasïna.
He couldn't say it himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj uk sañ puedkänti.
I really don’t know how that happened.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa ukax pasäna uk yatkti.
Or in another country.	Jan ukajj yaqha markanwa.

He was a little late.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qhepatwa ukham luraskäna.
Thank you so much and have a great day!.	¡Walpun yuspärta ukat mä jach'a uru!.
But he didn't say those words.	Ukampis janiw uka arunak arskänti.
It’s what we’ve always done.	Kuntï nayratpach lurapkta ukawa.
He hit it again.	Jupax wasitatwa ukar ch’allt’äna.
To be honest, it is no better today.	Chiqpachansa, jichhürunakanxa janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
Something almost so bad.	Kunas niya ukhama jan wali.
But you have to do it, too.	Ukampis jumajj lurañamawa, ukhamaraki.
But that’s the old.	Ukampis uka nayra.
He wants to control me.	Jupax nayar apnaqañ muni.
He’s definitely got it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukham jikxatasïna.
This was by no means noticeable before.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa nayrajj amuyaskänti.
In fact, I say it all the time.	Chiqansa, sapa kutiw ukham sista.
I don't want to live any longer.	Janiw jukʼamp jakañ munkti.
That’s when he knew.	Ukhaw jupajj yatïna.
But tonight it was.	Ukampis jichha arumax ukhamänwa.
But now he wanted to know more.	Ukampis jichhajj jukʼampiw yatiñ munäna.
I have never been there myself.	Naya pachpajj janipuniw ukar sarkti.
And seeing him again .	Ukat wasitat uñjasajj .
First time and last time.	Nayrïr kuti ukat qhipa kuti.
There is no urgency.	Janiw kuna jankʼak lurañas utjkiti.
He definitely needs to eat though.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw manq’añax wakisi ukampis.
After that, the problem began a bit.	Uka qhepatjja, uka jan waltʼäwejj mä jukʼa qalltäna.
I don’t want that to happen at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa ukham pasañap munkti.
He is nothing to me.	Jupajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa.

But let's see why that didn't happen.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham jan paskäna uk uñjañäni.
And now I’m still happy.	Ukat jichhax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
Better than nothing.	Jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
It was an intense struggle.	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw chʼamachasïna.
That has never been a good thing for me.	Ukajj janipuniw nayatakejj wali askïkiti.
There’s a lot of the latter.	Uka qhipa urunakanx walja ukanakaw utji.

But, he was like that.	Ukampis, jupajj ukhamänwa.
It doesn’t really happen that often.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham sapa kutix ukhamäkiti.
I’m afraid he’s still in pain.	Nayax axsaratwa jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
He again remained silent.	Jupajj wasitatwa jan kuns arsüna.

Everything is more important.	Taqi kunas juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
He didn't know where or why.	Jupajj kawkhansa ni kunatsa uk janiw yatkänti.
Just as you are doing now.	Kunjamtï jichhajj lurapkta ukhama.
So far, nothing has been done.	Jichhakamax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.

I appreciate it and see it’s worth it.	Nayax wali askit uñjta ukat uñjta wali askiwa.
I'm going to see him.	Nayajj jupar uñjir sarä.
Things are going quietly.	Kunanakas amukiw saraski.
He lives in the big city.	Jupax jach’a markan jakasi.
So far I can handle it pretty well.	Jichhakamax wali sum apnaqañ yatta.
There was no time to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix janiw kuna horasas utjkänti.
Except, this world is very unusual.	Jan ukasti, aka pachax wali jan uñt’atawa.
He saw her as a wonderful man, he thought .	Jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamwa uñjäna, sasaw amuyasïna .
I don’t want to say it properly.	Nayax janiw sum arsuñ munkti.
I think that’s a surprise.	Nayax amuyta ukax mä muspharkañawa.
But the reality is even more surprising.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
There is a little more to it than that.	Ukat sipansa mä jukʼa jukʼampiw utji.
I love this so much!.	¡Nayax akax walpun munasta!.
I want to do it all right.	Taqi ukanak sum lurañ munta.
This is strange, but not impossible.	Ukax muspharkañawa, ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
In fact, he had just left.	Chiqansa, jupax jichhakiw sarxäna.
They really don’t know anything.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuns yatipkiti.
You don’t want to see photos.	Janiw fotonak uñjañ munktati.
What do you know about it.	Kunas jumax yatisktawa.
About what he didn't do.	Kuntï jan lurkäna uka toqetwa.
Now he wants out.	Jichhax jupax mistuñ muni.
And it doesn’t mean anything of the sort.	Ukat janiw kunas uka kasta sañ munkiti.
It was the last thing I needed to do.	Qhep qhepa lurañanak lurañaw wakisïna.
All of this has always existed.	Taqe ukanakajj nayratpachaw utjäna.
She doesn’t want to see him.	Janiw jupar uñjañ munkiti.

What you see is not all there is.	Kuntï uñjkta ukajj janiw taqe kunas utjkiti.
He will do things extremely strange.	Jupaw kunanaktï sinti muspharkañ lurani.
He wanted to do it himself.	Jupa pachpa lurañwa munäna.
And who is that.	Ukat khitis ukajja.
One does not have the other.	Maynix janiw maynix utjkiti.
I really never expected this.	Chiqpachansa janipuniw uk suykayätti.
But maybe we can .	Ukampis inas jiwasajj .
But yes, it is.	Ukampis jïsa.
It doesn’t do a whole lot.	Janiw taqpach lurañanak lurkiti.
But most of all, long.	Ukampis taqi kunat sipansa, jaya tiempo.
It has everything you need.	Ukanx taqi kunatix wakiski ukanakaw utji.
He left a little late.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qhepatwa sarjjäna.
It seemed out of his control.	Ukajj jupar jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
The eyes of the snowflakes.	Nayra ch’uqi ch’uqi.
There was nothing much to do after that.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kunas walja lurañajj utjkänti.
But, people don’t know exactly where it is.	Ukampis, jaqinakax janiw kawkhans jikxatasi ukx sum yatipkiti.
What did you expect? 	¿Kunsa jumajj suykayäta?
He is not sure about it.	Jupajj uka toqet janiw sum amuykiti.
I recently attended such a meeting.	Jichhakiw ukham tantachäwir sarawayta.
That’s the way it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw kunjamtï lurañax wakiski ukhama.
He understood his duty.	Jupajj lurañap sum amuyäna.

I never saw it mentioned before.	Janipuniw nayrajj uka tuqit parlir uñjkti.
Therefore .	Ukatwa .
But maybe it's worth it.	Ukampis inas ukajj wakischispa.
He barely said anything.	Jupax juk’akiw kuns arsüna.
I personally come here all the time.	Naya pachpaw sapa kuti aka chiqar jutta.
But do it quietly.	Ukampis amukiw uk luram.
I always have a bed.	Nayax sapa kutiw mä ikiñan utjitu.
You can’t make this stuff up.	Jumax janiw aka yänak lurañjamäkiti.
You feel like you’re right.	Jumax ukham amuyasta.
I have done it twice now.	Jichhajj pä kutiw uk lurawayta.
I don’t remember anything like this last year.	Nayax janiw kunas pasïr marax ukham amtaskti.
But he would never do it for me.	Ukampis janipuniw nayatakejj uk lurkaspänti.
He meant to say.	Jupajj sañ munäna.
As uncomfortable as that is.	Kunjamtï ukajj jan walïki ukhama.
He might have to do that.	Jupajj inas ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
As it was done at the time.	Kunjamtï uka tiempon luraskäna ukhama.
But he didn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw ukham munkänti.
Two years ago now.	Pä mara nayraw jichhax.
I wasn’t surprised, actually.	Nayax janiw muspharkayätti, chiqpachansa.
I wanted to do something about it.	Uka toqet kuns lurañwa munta.
I’ve done this in the past.	Nayax nayra pachanx ukham lurawayta.
Two days, three days.	Pä uru, kimsa uru.
Someone should make a film about him some day.	Maynix mä urux jupat mä película lurañapawa.
Now it's okay.	Jichhajj walikïskiwa.
He said what he said.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna uk arsüna.
He repeated the word.	Jupajj uka aru wasitatwa arsüna.
And when .	Ukat kunapachatï .
Nothing is in isolation.	Janiw kunas sapakix utjkiti.
Let's see if that happens.	Ukajj pasani janicha uk uñjañäni.
That’s how things are.	Ukhamaw kunanakas utji.
I don’t like it.	Janiw nayar gustkituti.
That was wonderful, what we did.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, kuntï lurapkta ukajja.
He couldn't do that.	Ukjja jupajj janiw lurañ puedkänti.
He was a very bad guy.	Jupajj wali jan wali jaqënwa.
He was very excited about it.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uka toqet parläna.
She stared at him, almost speechless, but not quite.	Jupar uñchʼukiskäna, niyaw jan arskänti, ukampis janiw sum arskänti.
It is going as well as I expected.	Kunjamtï suykayäta ukhamarakiw sum saraski.
This is my first night here.	Akax nayrïr arumaw aka chiqan jikxatasi.
I don't know what could happen here.	Kunas akan pasaspa uk janiw yatkti.
He arrived a few days later.	Jupajj mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa purinïna.
You really shouldn’t do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.
I really didn’t expect that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham suykayätti.
Which, well, does what it says.	Kuna, wali, kuntix siski uk luraski.
One day sooner or later.	Mä urux jank’akiw jan ukax qhipürux.

But I didn’t see anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus uñjkti.
He was not like that .	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
You’re the only one who can do it.	Juma sapakiw uk lurasma.
He doesn’t want to drink last night.	Jupax janiw qhipa arumax umañ munkiti.
And it can never last long.	Ukat janipuniw jaya tiempox utjkaspati.

This guy wasn’t like that.	Aka waynax janiw ukhamäkänti.
It really sucked.	Chiqpachansa ukax chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
He surprised himself.	Jupa pachpaw muspharäna.
Whatever you do.	Kunsa jumax lurasma.
But that can have a negative impact.	Ukampis ukajj jan walinak luraspa.
It’s found every day.	Sapa uruw jikxatasi.
But I understand what you are saying.	Ukampis kuntï jumajj siskta uk sum amuyta.
I don’t do stuff like that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañanak lurkti.
Just try to do it once.	Mä kutikiw ukanak lurañatakix chʼamachasiñama.
He’s the one who has to do it.	Jupaw ukham lurañapa.
He’s a big guy, too.	Jupax jach’a jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
Because that’s what it was.	Kunatix ukax ukhamänwa.
Always excellent.	Sapa kutiw wali suma.
And someone else did later that day.	Ukat mayniw uka urux qhipürux ukham luratayna.

Also why, and more importantly, who.	Ukhamaraki kunatsa, ukat juk’amp wakiskiriwa, khitis.
And it certainly looks old.	Ukat chiqpachansa nayra uñtatawa.
That really stayed with me.	Ukajj cheqapuniw nayarojj qheparäna.
He was the guy for me.	Jupaw nayatakix uka waynax utjäna.

Someone is known.	Maynix uñt’atawa.
I suspect the latter.	Nayax qhipa tuqitx suyt’twa.
Well, so .	Ukhama, ukhama .
He looked the same way.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw uñnaqäna.
He was hungry and didn’t want to do anything.	Manq’at awtjataw jan kuns lurañ munkänti.
I am sure these will last a long time.	Ukanakajj walja tiempow utjani sasaw nayajj yatta.
He knew the place well.	Jupajj uka cheqan sum yatïna.

Or so it seems to me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj ukhamarakiw amuyasi.
The price was really good.	Chiqpachansa uka qullqix wali sumapunïnwa.
So, I’m going to say this.	Ukhama, nayax akham sañ munta.
But by now everyone knows it.	Ukampis jichhakamax taqiniw uk yatipxi.
I’m not about that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitxa.

How's that going.	Kunjamsa ukax saraski.
I think you are sad and you will be sad.	Nayax amuyta jumax llakitaw jikxatastaxa ukat llakitaw jikxatasïta.

It was beautiful there.	Ukanjja wali sumapunïnwa.
He moved in with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw jakañ qalltäna.
And here it is silent.	Ukat akanx amukiw jikxatasi.
He drove home in a car.	Jupajj mä autot utar sarjjäna.

That said it all.	Ukaw taqe ukanak arsüna.
He never said no.	Jupajj janipuniw janiw siskänti.
I think he already knows.	Nayax amuyta, jupax nayratpach yati.
I don't see how that can happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw uñjkti.
I don’t like everyone.	Nayax taqiniruw jan walin uñjta.
But he’s pretty cool.	Ukampis jupax wali sumawa.
There was a lot of energy.	Wali ch’amaw utjäna.
He was so surprised that he called.	Ukat wal muspharäna, ukatwa jawsäna.
I like it so far.	Nayax jichhakamax wali askiwa.
The moment is clear.	Uka pachax qhanaw uñjasi.
Maybe he should do that.	Inas jupax ukham lurañapa.
I gave you the letter.	Nayaw uka carta churta.
A great deal is needed.	Mä jachʼa lurañaw wakisi.
She didn't think she was very attractive.	Jupajj janiw sinti suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
He talked to her.	Jupajj jupampiw parläna.
He left feeling very sorry for her.	Jupat wali llakitaw sarjjäna.
But he didn’t want to go for it.	Ukampis janiw ukatakix sarañ munkänti.
He sees it as such.	Jupajj ukham uñji.
I don’t have time, really.	Nayax janiw tiemponïkti, chiqpachansa.
But there can only be one.	Ukampis mä sapakiw utjaspa.

He became more and more active.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jukʼamp chʼamachasïna.
That’s too hard to be true.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
And he said no.	Ukat jupax janiw sasaw säna.
It has nothing to do with me.	Janiw kunas nayamp lurañax utjkiti.

That’s what it feels like.	Ukax ukat ukham jikxatasi.
Yeah, yeah you might like that.	Jïsa, jïsa jumatakix ukax wali askïspawa.

Of course, there was a little more to it than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa mä jukʼa jukʼampiw utjäna.
And good cigar.	Ukat suma cigarro.

No one has done it yet.	Janiw khitis jichhakamax uk lurkiti.
There’s no way to do everything perfectly.	Janiw kunas taqi kuns sum lurañax utjkiti.

It’s good for everything.	Taqi kuna lurañatakix wali askiwa.

A prison in crisis.	Mä carcelan jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
Maybe you want to build a new house.	Inas jumax machaq uta lurañ munsta.
It really didn’t do anything to him.	Chiqpachansa, janiw juparux kuns lurkänti.
I went to see her the other day.	Nayax yaqha urux utaparuw uñjir sarawayta.
It was a wonderful day.	Uka urux wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
So it's not too bad right now.	Ukhamajj janiw jichhajj sinti jan walïkiti.
He spoke a lot.	Jupax walpun arsüna.

And yes, it is! 	¡Ukat jïsa!

Warm and soft.	Junt’u ukat llamp’u.
I’m going to be kind of honest.	Nayax mä juk’a chiqapar arsuñ munta.
I quickly realized that he was serious.	Jupajj sinti jan wali jaqëtap jankʼakiw amuyayäta.
But the funny thing is, he’s depressed.	Ukampis wali muspharkañawa, jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
It’s almost as if she wants him here.	Niya ukhamarakiw jupar akan munkaspa ukhama.
And he did it many times.	Ukat walja kutiw uk luraskäna.
And then it became clear.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, qhanaw amuyasïna.
I didn’t want to be like that.	Janiw ukham sarnaqañ munkayätti.

And yes, this means you.	Ukat jïsa, akax jumaruw sañ muni.

But I just wanted to say something.	Ukampis jichhakiw mä jukʼa arsuñ munta.
Don't forget that part.	Uka chiqat jan armasimti.

And you know, it actually looks really cool.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa, chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali suma uñtatawa.

That's all he'll do.	Ukakiw jupajj lurani.
He talked to her for a long time.	Jupampiw walja tiempo parläna.
But that was not the case now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukajj ukhamäkänti.
A heavy downpour is imminent.	Mä jach’a jallux niyaw purini.

One thing really stood out.	Mä kunaw chiqpachapuni amuyasïna.
But that's a bit .	Ukampis ukajj mä jukʼa .
There’s no reason why he should, really.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti kunatsa jupax ukham lurañapa, chiqpachansa.
But eventually he agreed.	Ukampis qhepatjja, jupajj iyaw sänwa.
I just understand that.	Nayax ukhamakiw amuyasta.
This marked the beginning of a new era.	Ukaw machaq tiempon qalltäna.

No one understands it better than I do.	Janiw khitis nayat sipan jukʼamp sum amuykiti.

He didn't have it.	Jupajj janiw ukajj utjkänti.
That’s not necessary here.	Ukax janiw akanx wakiskiti.
Of course there are many of them.	Chiqansa walja ukanakaw utji.

Not really in town.	Janiw chiqpachapunix markan utjkiti.
There was nothing out here.	Janiw kunas aka anqan utjkänti.
You know what he did to me.	Kuntï nayar lurkäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
So obviously he is there.	Ukhamajj qhanaw jupajj ukan utji.
I don't understand why he thinks that.	Kunatsa ukham amuyi uk janiw amuykti.
I don’t remember the night before.	Nayax janiw nayrïr arumax amtaskti.
Last year it barely did that.	Nayra marax juk’akiw ukham lurawayi.
He was himself again .	Jupajj wasitatwa jupa pachpa .
Do this every two weeks.	Sapa pä semanaw ukham lurañama.
He wanted to come so badly.	Jupax wali jan waliw jutañ munäna.
For me now there has been less and less.	Nayatakix jichhax juk’akiw juk’amp utjawayi.
And the feeling, this time, is wrong.	Ukat kunjamsa jikxatasi, aka kutix, janiw walïkiti.
In a city that’s good for me, too.	Mä markanx nayatakix wali askiwa, ukhamaraki.
I didn’t know how we were going to do it.	Kunjamsa lurañäni uk janiw yatkayätti.
After that, he wanted to do it every time.	Uka qhepatjja, sapa kutiw uk lurañ munäna.
All of this is good for me.	Taqi ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
He left today.	Jichhüruw sarjjäna.
¡That's a good thing!.	¡Ukajj wali askiwa!.
Now he spoke up.	Jichhax jupax arsüna.
There was never a problem, a problem, or a problem.	Janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti, kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti, ni kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
This happened especially later.	Ukajj qhepat jukʼampiw pasäna.
I’m doing less of myself, and more of them.	Nayax naya pachpaw juk’amp jisk’a luraskta, ukat jupanakar juk’amp luraskta.
He wanted to know exactly how she was doing.	Jupajj kunjamsa sarnaqäna uk sum yatiñ munäna.
That's a good thing, that's a good thing.	Ukajj wali askiwa, ukajj wali askiwa.
But more than that, it's fun.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, wali kusiskañawa.
So this is how it started.	Ukhamajj akham sasaw qalltäna.

I think that’s what works best for me.	Nayax amuyta, ukax nayatakix juk’amp askiwa.

But it’s called yes.	Ukampis jïsa satawa.
He said it twice.	Pä kutiw ukham säna.
Honestly, that’s good for you.	Chiqpachansa, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
What is it that.	Kunas ukax.
There was nothing to do, and everyone knows it.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, ukat taqiniw uk yatipxi.
I wish I could do it again, but not here.	Nayax wasitat lurañ munta, ukampis janiw akan lurkti.
He was surprisingly happy.	Jupajj muspharkañ kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But you know that was it.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa uk jumajj yatisktawa.
But you need to do that first.	Ukampis uk nayraqat lurañaw wakisi.
He never knew that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk yatkänti.
No one knows what might happen.	Kunas pasaspa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He was tall and thin.	Jupajj wali jachʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqënwa.

And that’s okay, too.	Ukat ukax walikïskiwa, ukhamaraki.

No, he doesn't	Janiwa, jupajj janiw .
On the contrary, it seemed helpless.	Jan ukasti, jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Now it’s time to give it a shot.	Jichhax mä ch’uqi churañ pachaw purini.
But you should never do that .	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurañamäkiti .
He wants to admit it.	Jupajj uk iyaw sañ munaraki.
I don't want to know about it.	Janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkti.
But he didn't understand where.	Ukampis kawkhansa uk janiw amuykänti.
He didn't know what to do after that.	Uka qhepatjja, kunsa lurani uk janiw yatkänti.
Well about that.	Suma uka tuqitxa.
Not all of these are available.	Janiw taqe ukanakajj utjkiti.

You, of course, know that.	Jumax, chiqpachansa, uk yatisktawa.

I don’t really mean that.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix ukham sañ munkti.
He never really meant it.	Jupajj janipuniw cheqpachapun ukham sañ munkänti.
But in many cases this is not the case.	Ukampis walja kutix janiw ukhamäkiti.
That is what I like the most.	Ukaw jukʼamp gustitu.

No one understood it except myself.	Janiw khitis amuykänti, jan ukasti naya pachpaw amuyasïna.
That’s what happens in such a country.	Ukhamaw ukham markan pasaspa.
Never really had to do that before.	Janipuniw nayrajj cheqpachapun ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
He didn't really want to.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun munkänti.
He wanted something else.	Jupajj yaqha kunsa munäna.
I did the same with mine.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw nayampejj lurawayta.
That is why he said this strange thing.	Ukatwa uka muspharkañ arunak säna.

This is truly the best of both worlds.	Chiqpachansa akax pä pachan wali sumawa.

I was amazed at the results.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk uñjasajj wal muspharta.
He’s very nice, very nice.	Jupax wali sumawa, wali sumawa.
But you have to be very careful.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw uk lurañama.
Something happened to it.	Kunas ukaruw pasäna.

It means a lot to me.	Nayatakejj ukajj walpun sañ muni.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Nayan, nayan, nayan.

He didn't want to tell her.	Jupajj janiw jupar yatiyañ munkänti.

Everything, no matter how big or small.	Taqi kuna, qawqha jach’a jisk’a.

He feels it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jikjjatasi.
He plans everything that way.	Jupax taqi kuns ukham amti.

I saw that immediately.	Ukaw jankʼak uñjta.
It’s very difficult, very unusual.	Wali ch’amawa, wali jan uñt’atawa.

It’s the best thing that’s ever happened.	Ukax wali sumawa, ukax janiw kunapachas utjkiti.
Very little is impossible.	Wali jukʼakiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
You are too too quick.	Jumax sinti sinti jank’akiw jikxatastaxa.

No one had any idea where we were going.	Kawkirus sarapjjta uk janiw khitis amuykänti.
Do everything tomorrow.	Qhipürux taqi kun lurañamawa.
Let’s see that day.	Uka uru uñjañäni.
He won't do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkaniti.
None of us are out there like that.	Janiw khitis jiwasax ukham anqan utjkiti.
He certainly saw it.	Chiqpachansa jupax uk uñjäna.
It really feels that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyasi.
He certainly will.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham lurani.
This should be done every night.	Akax sapa arumaw lurañapa.
Whatever you can do.	Kuntï lurañjamäki ukajja.
He immediately agreed with me.	Jupajj jankʼakiw nayamp iyaw säna.
Then he began to eat.	Ukat manqʼañ qalltäna.
That's when you need to get things done.	Uka tiemponjja, lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
It’s a nice place to stay.	Ukax mä suma uñt’atawa.
Don’t let that happen.	Janiw ukham pasañap jaytañamäkiti.
But, at the time, he didn't care.	Ukampis, uka tiemponjja, janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
He couldn't have been more wrong.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp jan walinak lurkaspänti.
Tell me why you want to leave.	Kunatsa sarxañ munta uk yatiyapxita.
You already do that.	Jumax nayratpach ukham lurasma.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa puedkänti.
I really like this world.	Chiqpachansa aka pachax nayatakix wali askiwa.
So there is no immediate need.	Ukhamajj janiw jankʼak wakiskiti.
You’re constantly reminding yourself of it.	Jumax sapa kutiw uk amtaskta.
That is enough for you.	Ukajj jumatakejj walikïskiwa.
He gave me water.	Uma churäna.
Except it’s only once.	Jan ukasti mä kutikiw utji.
I don't want to get into it.	Nayajj janiw ukar mantañ munkti.
But he knows that this is impossible.	Ukampis ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa jupajj sum yati.
And he couldn't have done better.	Ukat janiw jukʼamp sum lurkaspänti.
Instead, he .	Jan ukasti, jupax .
And it was, of course.	Ukat ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
And I know exactly when.	Ukat kunapachas uk sum yatta.
He talked about it, but not for long.	Jupajj uka toqet parläna, ukampis janiw jaya tiempojj ukham lurkänti.
He won’t do it.	Janiw uk lurkaniti.
But it seemed like anything could happen.	Ukampis kunas pasaspa ukhamänwa.
Not now, he told himself.	Janiw jichhajj sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
He himself has felt this way many times.	Jupa pachpajj walja kutiw ukham jikjjatasïna.
Everything is quiet now.	Jichhax taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasi.
But there’s something interesting there.	Ukampis ukanx kunas wali askiwa.
But then he moved back.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa ukar sarjjäna.
He understood the little words.	Jupajj uka jiskʼa arunak amuyasïna.
Never, never never ever.	Janipuniw, janipuniw janipuniw kunapachas.
That’s exactly what’s going to happen.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunas pasani.
I have no idea what the question is.	Kunas uka jisktʼajj uk janiw amuykti.
A few days later, it was too early.	Mä qhawqha urunak qhepatjja, wali nayrajj ukhamänwa.
After that, they .	Uka qhepatjja, jupanakajj .
It’s a lot of fun, actually.	Ukax wali kusiskañawa, chiqpachansa.
It’s good to do that again.	Ukham wasitat lurañax wali askiwa.

What do you think is the reason?.	¿Kunas jumatakix kunatsa?.
But they’re not.	Ukampis jupanakax janiw.
Nothing, too much.	Jan kuna, sinti jach’a.
He himself said that he didn’t care.	Jupa pachpaw ukax janiw nayatakix wakiskiti sasaw säna.
He asked after you.	Jupajj jumat qhepatwa jisktʼäna.
That’s because there is no more important person.	Ukax kunatix janiw juk’amp wakiskir jaqix utjkiti.
We’ll make good on that.	Jiwasax uka tuqitx sum lurañäni.

Don't forget to do this.	Uk lurañatakejj jan armasimti.
But then he said no.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw sasaw säna.
And for a while there was nothing.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw kunas utjkänti.
Well, two of them.	Ukhama, pä.

They are very, very strange.	Jupanakax wali, wali muspharkañawa.
Why, yeah, of course.	Kunatsa, jïsa, chiqpachansa.
I said it wasn't right.	Nayajj janiw walïkiti sasaw sista.
And quickly, too.	Ukat jankʼakiw, ukhamaraki.

We don't need it.	Janiw jiwasajj munaskiti.

And it just happened the other day.	Ukat nayrax mä urux ukhamakiw pasäna.

I find nothing more negative about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw jukʼamp jan walinak jikxatkti.
I didn’t tell anyone to do it.	Janiw khitirus uk luram siskti.
He wanted more than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munäna.
I don’t think so, of course.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
Thank you so much, again.	Nayax walpun yuspärta, mayamp mayamp.

He said he always wanted to live here.	Jupajj sapa kutiw akan jakañ munta sasaw säna.

He asked the questions.	Jupaw jisktʼanak jisktʼäna.
It was the first time he had received a letter from her.	Nayrïr kutiw jupat mä carta katoqäna.

So there is no other option.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkiti.
That would be really interesting.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali askïspawa.
Someone walked inside.	Mayniw uka manqhan sarnaqäna.

He didn't want to stay here alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak akan qheparañ munkänti.

Until recently, it wasn’t.	Jichhakamax janiw ukhamäkänti.

And it was true, it was delicious.	Ukat chiqaw ukhama, wali sumapunïnwa.

On the one hand, that would be good.	Mä tuqitxa, ukax wali askïspawa.
Or, for that matter, who did what to whom.	Jan ukax, uka tuqitxa, khitis khitirus kuns luräna.
There is nothing necessary for this.	Ukatakejj janiw kunas wakiskiti.
But no coffee money, no money at all.	Ukampis janiw café qullqix utjkänti, janiw kuna qullqis utjkänti.

He says his name with great affection.	Jupax wali munasiñampiw sutip arsu.

Of course, it cannot last much longer.	Chiqansa, janiw jukʼamp jaya tiempox utjkaspati.

Twenty years later.	Pä tunka mara qhepatjja.

So he walked faster.	Ukatwa jupajj jukʼamp jankʼak sarnaqäna.

He wasn't aware of it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuyaskänti.

Fortunately, he didn’t say anything.	Wali askiwa, jupax janiw kuns arskänti.
He’s doing a lousy job.	Jupax mä jan wali irnaqäw luraski.

There are no people in a room.	Mä cuarto ukanx janiw jaqinakax utjkiti.
He loved everyone.	Taqiniruw munasïna.
This is really the most important thing of all.	Chiqpachansa akax taqi kunat sipansa wali wakiskiriwa.
The man died hours later.	Uka jaqejj walja horanak qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
He finally speaks.	Jupax qhipharux arsu.
He didn’t know anything like this would happen.	Janiw kunas ukham pasañap yatkänti.
Of course, there was a reason.	Chiqansa, kunatsa ukham lurañax utjäna.
I didn't want to tell you that.	Nayajj janiw ukham yatiyañ munkayätti.
I really don’t want that to happen.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham pasañap munkti.
Really nice wine.	Chiqpachansa wali suma vino.
People know what it is.	Jaqinakax kunas ukax uk yatipxi.
He sadly leaves the scene.	Jupax llakitaw uka chiqat sarxi.
The snowflake, the snowflake.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi, ch’uqi.
And you are a criminal.	Ukat jumax mä jan wali lurir jaqïtawa.
You have to tell them.	Jumaw jupanakar yatiyañama.
He told her about his work.	Jupaw irnaqäwipat yatiyäna.
I appreciate everything about you.	Nayax jumanakat taqi kunas wali askiwa.
I don't want to talk to him, really.	Janiw jupamp parltʼañ munkti, chiqpachansa.
He needed you more.	Jupajj jumaruw jukʼamp munäna.
And you don’t have to do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañamäkiti.
I immediately said yes.	Ukat jankʼakiw jïsa sasaw sista.
My dearest brother.	Wali munat jilatajja.
It’s really funny when it happens.	Chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa kunapachatï ukax paskäna ukhaxa.
He obviously cared for her.	Jupajj jupar sum uñjäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He knew where it was.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk yatïna.
But really, you know that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, jumax uk yatisktawa.
That’s not what’s good.	Ukax janiw kunatix askïkiti.
But nothing seemed to be the case.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham amuykänti.
Here’s how it works.	Akax kunjamsa uk uñjañäni.
These are two important things for me.	Ukanakajj nayatakejj pä wakiskiriwa.
He never existed.	Jupajj janipuniw utjkänti.
But it has come very quickly so far.	Ukampis wali jankʼakiw jichhakamax purini.
The afternoon was beautiful.	Tardejj wali sumapunïnwa.
That would be a good thing if you did.	Ukham lurasajj ukajj wali askïspawa.
And he saw it.	Ukat uñjäna.
But he has to do it.	Ukampis jupax uk lurañapawa.
He never existed.	Janipuniw jupajj utjkänti.
Three of these are required.	Kimsa ukhaw munasispa.
He almost saw it.	Jupajj niyaw uk uñjäna.
It doesn’t matter to me.	Nayatakix janiw kunas wakiskiti.
It’s not much better.	Janiw juk’amp askïkiti.
Yes, that felt good.	Jïsa, ukajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
And again the next day.	Ukat qhipürux wasitatwa.
He uses it very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa ukanak apnaqi.
And this year, nothing.	Ukat aka marax, janiw kunas utjkiti.
I thought the same thing.	Nayajj uka pachpaw amuyayäta.
It took me a few years to get there.	Ukar puriñkamax mä qhawqha maranakaw munasïna.
No one knows what he would have done.	Kunsa luraspäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I can drive a day straight.	Nayax mä uru chiqaw auto apnaqañ yatta.
Before the aftermath.	Nayrajj uka qhepatjja.
Your morning is beautiful.	Juman alwajj wali sumawa.
Just like you know.	Kunjamtï jumax yatkta ukhama.
Whatever you need.	Kunas munasispa.
He could not speak for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw parlañ puedkänti.
These were not things he wanted.	Ukanakajj janiw jupar munkänti.
She’s obviously a woman.	Jupax qhanaw mä warmiwa.
Instead, we have only one.	Jan ukasti mä sapakiw utjistu.
You like that .	Jumax ukham munasmati .
I have no choice.'	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti’ sasaw säna.
I left it there.	Nayax ukan jaytawayta.
I don't need to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
Do what you want to use.	Kuntï apnaqañ munkta uk lurañamawa.
There was a reason for this .	Mä kunatsa uka lurañajj utjäna .
Let's see if that happens.	Ukajj pasani uk uñjañäni.
These are all important things.	Ukanakajj taqe kunas wali wakiskiriwa.
But, it would be worth it.	Ukampis, ukajj wali askïspawa.
He felt that there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti sasaw amuyasïna.
Whatever he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk.
And that’s exactly how it feels.	Ukat ukhamarakiw chiqpachapunix jikxatasi.
Like none of you have done.	Kunjamtï jumanakat jan khitis lurapkta ukhama.
I have no idea how he is.	Kunjamsa jupajj uk janiw amuykti.
And he’s nice to me.	Ukat jupax nayatakix wali sumawa.
That was pretty cool, yeah.	Ukax wali sumapunïnwa, jïsa.
Warm and still.	Junt’u ukat wali.
But it will happen again, one day.	Ukampis ukajj wasitatwa pasani, mä uru.
I don't know any more than you do.	Nayajj janiw jumat sipansa jukʼamp yatkti.
He had seen it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukanak uñjäna.
This will have to be done again.	Ukax wasitat lurañaw wakisini.
I really want to.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw munta.
But I don’t believe it.	Ukampis janiw creykti.
I didn’t know how to do that.	Janiw uk lurañ yatkayätti.
A lot happened so fast.	Walja kunas wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
He stayed there for about an hour.	Niya mä horaw ukan qheparäna.
I hope to be home soon, soon.	Nayax jank’akiw utar puriñ munta, jank’akiw suyt’askta.
I’ve said it all along.	Taqi pachanx ukham sasaw arsuwayta.
He felt especially old.	Jupajj jukʼampiw chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
That’s all we need to do here.	Ukakiw akan lurañax wakisi.
He called her tonight.	Jupajj jichha arumaw jupar jawsäna.
The day started out miserable.	Uka urux wali llakitaw qalltäna.
He’s a gentleman.	Jupax mä llamp’u jaqiwa.
Why not, someone asked.	¿Kunatsa jan ukhamäki, sasaw maynix jisktʼäna.
I was horrified to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj wal ajjsarayäta.
He never liked it much.	Jupajj janipuniw walpun munkänti.
I don't want to be like you.	Janiw nayajj jumar uñtasit lurañ munkti.
At the time, it was amazing.	Uka tiemponjja, wali muspharkañawa.
Only once this.	Mä kutikiw akax.
You, too, are.	Jumax, ukhamaraki.
No, it’s not a bad thing.	Janiwa, janiw kunas walïkiti.
He was immediately moved.	Jupajj jankʼakiw chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
He made the delicacy, of course.	Jupaw uka suma manq’a luratayna, chiqpachansa.
Decided to buy your own.	Juman pachpa alañ amtawayta.
Now he knows exactly what he wants.	Jichhajj kuntï munki uk sum yati.
He denied that was the case.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw arsuwayi.
But the timing is crucial.	Ukampis uka tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
He decides it doesn’t matter.	Jupax janiw kunäkisa sasaw amti.
One day I just realized this.	Mä urux jichhakiw uk amuyasta.
I told him not to do that.	Nayax juparux janiw ukham luramti sasaw sista.
The man could have done that.	Uka jaqejj ukham luraspänwa.
I want him to do that.	Nayajj jupar ukham lurañapatakiw munta.
He hoped there was no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati sasaw suyäna.
And you can do the same.	Ukat jumax ukhamarakiw ukham lurasma.
I never knew how to do it well.	Janipuniw ukanak sum lurañ yatkti.
I said they might.	Nayax jupanakax inas sasaw sista.
I didn’t want money.	Janiw qollqe munkayätti.
It’s available all day.	Taqi uruw utji.
All of this was a little disappointing.	Taqi ukanakax mä juk’a chuym ch’allxtayäna.
But he’s already in bed.	Ukampis jupax niyaw ikiñan jikxatasïna.
I was actually surprised by that.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa wal muspharta.
Everything is as you would expect.	Taqi kunas kunjamtï jumax suykayäta ukhamawa.
It makes me happier.	Ukham lurasajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He did not say how.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk janiw siskänti.
I gave it a hard time.	Nayajj wali chʼamampiw ukanak churta.
I love everything you said.	Nayax taqi kunatix jumax siskta ukanakat walpun munasta.
It gave him a bit of a surprise.	Ukaw jupar mä jukʼa muspharkañ churäna.
He decides to leave.	Jupax sarxañ amti.
He died a day later.	Jupajj mä urunak qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
It makes sense to do that from here.	Aka chiqat ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
But that doesn't seem to matter.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw amuyasi.
What are you going to do next?.	¿Kunsa jumajj jutïrin lurasma?.
Then try again.	Ukat wasitatwa chʼamachasiñama.
But not in the way you do.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumanakajj lurapkta ukhama.
I promise you that you will.	Ukham lurañamawa sasaw arsuwayta.
And obviously it’s .	Ukat qhanaw ukax .
So he decides to do what is necessary.	Ukatwa kunatï wakiski uk lurañ amti.
The timing is perfect.	Uka pachax wali askiwa.
And yes, he was afraid of himself.	Ukat jïsa, jupa pachpaw ajjsaräna.
Bigger and bigger and bigger.	Jach’a ukat jach’a ukat jach’a.
Everyone knows how to walk.	Taqinipuniw sarnaqañ yatipxi.
It moved quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
When it does everything I want it to.	Kunapachatï taqi kuntï nayax munkta uk luraski ukhaxa.
And that is difficult.	Ukat ukajj chʼamakiwa.
There are no such people.	Janiw uka jaqenakajj utjkiti.
Flat smooth, soft.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi, llamp’u.
It didn't matter that no one was there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkänti, ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
Things are better.	Kunanakas jukʼamp sumawa.
He’s the guy.	Jupax uka waynawa.
And so stupid.	Ukat ukhama llamp’u chuyma.
That’s something I’m always aware of.	Uka tuqitxa nayax sapa kutiw amuyasta.
Of course, he didn't want to leave.	Chiqansa, janiw sarxañ munkänti.
You’re almost .	Jumax niya .
There is nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis ukan utjkiti.
You know, something like that.	Jumax yatisktawa, kunas ukham.
He was small and awkward.	Jupajj jiskʼa ukat jan wali jaqënwa.
I'm never going to go.	Janipuniw sarkäti.
This guy uses amazing language.	Aka waynax muspharkañ arunak apnaqi.
So yeah of course.	Ukhamajj jïsa chiqpachansa.
He wanted something more, so he left.	Jupajj jukʼamp kunsa munäna, ukatwa sarjjäna.
The impossible happened all the time.	Jan lurañjamäki ukanakajj sapa kutiw pasäna.
He’s right next to a door.	Jupax chiqaw mä punku jak’an jikxatasi.
He was busy at the time.	Jupajj uka tiemponjja, jan tiemponiw jikjjatasïna.
He means exactly what he says.	Kuntï siski uk sum sañ muni.
I don't understand what you just said.	Kuntï jichhak siskta uk janiw amuykti.
I didn’t tell him that.	Janiw nayax jupar uk siskti.
That is even better now.	Ukajj jichhajj jukʼamp askiwa.
This guy is a great villain.	Aka waynax wali jach’a jan wali jaqiwa.
I didn't know about it.	Janiw uka toqet yatkayätti.
It’s a lot of fun!.	¡Ukax wali kusiskañawa!.
Or for nothing at all.	Jan ukajj jan kunatsa.
He barely moves during the day, really.	Jupax juk’akiw urux sarnaqäna, chiqpachansa.
I did a lot of it by myself.	Naya sapakiw walja lurañanak lurayäta.
I wonder why he did that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna sasaw jisktʼasta.
Things are looking bad so far.	Jichhakamax kunanakas jan waliw uñtasi.
I don’t really want to get into it.	Janiw chiqpachapuni ukar mantañ munkti.
I’ve been surprised by this for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw uka tuqit muspharta.
But there is something worse than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan waliw utji.
You don’t want that to happen.	Jumax janiw ukham pasañap munktati.
I don't think he ever liked me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayar gustkituti sasaw amuyta.
I don’t want anyone.	Janiw khitirus munaskiti.
He was not in bed.	Jupajj janiw ikiñan utjkänti.
And it’s the same for me.	Ukat nayatakix ukhamarakiw.
It happens every day.	Sapa uruw ukax utji.
There is no food.	Janiw manq’añax utjkiti.
That’s not one.	Ukax janiw mä.
I feel really bad about this.	Chiqpachansa aka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatastxa.
The old part, too.	Nayra chiqa, ukhamaraki.
Large and small of one kind or another.	Mä kasta jan ukax yaqha kasta jach’a ukat jisk’a.
And of course, it wasn’t.	Ukat chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
He will do so .	Jupajj ukham lurani .
Let’s see if it works this time.	Jichha kutin walikïskiti janicha uk uñjañäni.
That's what he's saying.	Ukaw jupajj siski.
And try not to do too much.	Ukat jan sinti lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
There are really two possibilities.	Chiqpachansa pä lurañaw utji.
I can't think of three.	Janiw kimsa tuqit amuytʼirjamäkti.
Overall this is a lot of fun.	Taqi kunat sipansa akax wali kusiskañawa.
Maybe two, or twenty.	Inas pä, jan ukax pä tunka.
He refused, vehemently.	Jupax janiw sasaw arsuwayi, wali ch’amampiw.
Not when he wanted it in every way.	Janiw kunapachatï taqi tuqit munkäna ukhaxa.
Does anyone know how.	¿Khitis kunjamsa uk lurañ yati.
He told them what had happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk jupanakar yatiyäna.
Everything was about him.	Taqi kunas jupat parläna.
It’s so warm.	Ukhama junt’u.
I made breakfast.	Nayax desayuno lurayäta.
He talked about it every night.	Jupajj sapa arumaw uka toqet parläna.
He says it’s harder.	Ukax juk’amp ch’amaw sasaw saraki.
He started talking about something else.	Jupax yaqha tuqit arsuñ qalltäna.
He had a bit of trouble last year.	Jupax nayrïr marax mä juk’a jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
Anything else.	Kunas yaqha tuqitxa.
Small, long left.	Jisk’a, jach’a ch’iqa.
I hope this guy likes it.	Nayax suyt’twa aka waynax wali askiwa.
He's in trouble again.	Jupax wasitat jan walt'äwin jikxatasi.
He wanted it even more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw ukanak munäna.
He didn't know how it would turn out.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
That's what's important right now.	Ukajj jichhajj wali wakiskiriwa.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Janiwa, ukax janiw askïkiti.
He walked quickly, anxiously.	Jupax jank’akiw sarnaqäna, llakitaw sarnaqäna.
In the past, this was not the case.	Nayra tiemponjja, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I think yes and no.	Nayax jïsa ukat janiw sasaw amuyta.
He was leaving now in a hurry.	Jupajj jichhajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
I make money because of what I do.	Kuntï lurawaykta ukatwa qollqe jikjjatasta.
And something just happened.	Ukat kunas jichhakiw pasäna.
He didn't want the ball.	Jupajj janiw pelot munkänti.
He saw the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk uñjäna.
Try not to do it.	Jan lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
But that’s just how he works.	Ukampis ukhamakiw jupax irnaqäna.
In fact, .	Chiqansa, .
But that seems to be a good thing.	Ukampis ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
A pretty good beer.	Mä suma suma cerveza.
Don't rush them.	Janiw jupanakar jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
You have a lot of opportunity.	Jumax walja oportunidad ukaniwa.
You know she’s a woman.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax mä warmiwa.

You seem to be interested.	Jumax wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
And that man.	Ukat uka jaqix.
I refuse to admit it.	Nayajj janiw uk iyaw sañ munkti.
Therefore, we .	Ukatwa, jiwasajj .
No! 	¡Janiwa!
nothing! 	¡janiwa!
I think its stupid to do that.	Nayax amuyta ukax loqhe ukham lurañax.
He went on for two hours.	Jupajj pä horaw uka toqet saräna.
There isn’t that much money.	Janiw uka qullqix utjkiti.
I really think that’s a good thing.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
I’m excited about the future of this season.	Nayax aka pachanx jutïr pachanx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Two, actually.	Pä, chiqpachansa.
But he did it, and he did it well.	Ukampis jupajj uk luräna, wali sumwa luräna.
He had done it before.	Jupajj nayraw uk luräna.
Another bad night in bed.	Yaqha jan wali arumaw ikiñan jikxatasïna.
And it obviously wasn’t.	Ukat qhanaw jan ukhamäkänti.
But he couldn't tell her all about it.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak yatiyañ puedkänti.
And only once, at that.	Ukat mä kutikiw, uka tiemponjja.
I've never had it.	Janipuniw jan ukax utjkituti.

I’ve done everything.	Nayax taqi kuns lurawayta.
He is essential to improvement.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum lurañatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.
But that was days ago.	Ukampis ukajj walja urunak nayraw pasäna.
He was not a perfect one.	Jupajj janiw mä jan kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
It took about half an hour.	Ukatakejj niya chika horaw munasïna.
I see one in here.	Nayax mä aka manqhan uñjta.

It’s still a pleasure.	Wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
That’s who he is now.	Ukhamaw jichhax jupax khitïnsa.
On this point, I tend to agree with him.	Uka tuqitxa, nayax jupampiw mä amtar puriñ yatta.
He was talking about you.	Jupaw jumat parläna.
But he’s in extremely bad shape.	Ukampis jupax sinti jan walin uñjasi.
There isn’t really anything or anyone here.	Aka chiqanx janiw chiqpachans kunas ni khitis utjkiti.
But ultimately it means nothing.	Ukampis qhipharux janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
He can't do that, not now.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkaspati, janiw jichhajj lurkaspati.
I hope something comes of this.	Nayax suyt’twa kunas aka tuqitx jutani.
There’s still somewhere inside the thing.	Ukanx waliw kawkhans uka yänak manqhan utji.
But that didn't mean much.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti sañ munkänti.
But he loved her even more.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼampiw jupar munasïna.
This is completely unnecessary.	Ukax taqpach jan wakiskiriwa.
I’ve been there twice.	Nayax pä kutiw sarawayta.
Too much blood, he thought.	Sinti wila, sasaw amuyäna.
He looked really good out here.	Jupajj cheqapuniw aka anqan sum uñnaqäna.
Do this to him.	Juparux aka luram.
But he knows something.	Ukampis jupajj kunsa sum yati.
But then something is wrong.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, kunas jan walïki.
But that will be more than enough for you.	Ukampis ukax jumatakix jukʼampiw utjani.
But he felt better almost immediately.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
He gave me the beer.	Jupaw uka cerveza churitu.
Do whatever you want there.	Ukan kunanaktï munkta uk luram.
I hear bad things.	Jan walinak istʼta.
A little bit of a word.	Mä jisk’a jisk’a aru.
But, you know, it’s not too bad.	Ukampis, jumax yatisktawa, janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
He was really nice to her, too.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw juparux sum uñjäna, ukhamaraki.
Every time he left.	Sapa kutiw jupax sarxäna.
Therefore,	Ukatwa, .
You’ve really got it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw jikxatastaxa.
He has always wanted you.	Jupajj nayratpachaw jumar munäna.
Red too much, too bad.	Wila sinti jach’a, sinti jan wali.

He doesn't like it very much.	Jupajj janiw sinti munaskiti.
I never refused.	Janipuniw nayajj jan munkti.
I would love to see more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp uñjañ wal munta.
Really though.	Chiqpachansa ukampis.

And so do you guys.	Ukat jumanakax ukhamaraki.
Every day! 	¡Sapa uru!
I’ll say this once.	Nayax mä kutix akham sañ munta.

But he couldn't tell the truth.	Ukampis janiw kunatï cheqäki uk arsuñ puedkänti.
No, there’s nothing there.	Janiwa, janiw kunas ukanx utjkiti.
I feel better that way.	Nayax ukham juk’amp sum jikxatastxa.
Thank you all so much!.	¡Taqiniruw walpun yuspärta!.
That means eating long and well.	Ukajj jaya tiempo ukat sum manqʼañ sañ muni.
But now he was watching them more closely.	Ukampis jichhax jukʼamp sumwa jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
I can't say what will happen now.	Jichhajj kunas pasani uk janiw siskti.
He doesn't like them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar munaskiti.

He didn’t say anything the night before.	Jupax janiw nayrïr arumax kuns arskänti.

This does not mean that there is never a problem.	Ukajj janiw janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti sañ munkiti.
It doesn’t matter, anymore.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, juk’ampi.
These are all good things.	Ukanakax taqi kunas wali askiwa.

But he didn't seem sincere.	Ukampis janiw taqe chuyma jaqëkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.

Now he knew everything.	Jichhajj jupajj taqe kunwa yatïna.
That’s what he looked like this evening.	Ukhamaw jupax jichhür jayp’ux uñnaqäna.
Nothing felt special .	Janiw kunas wali askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti .
I would definitely go again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat sarañ munta.

Except in this case.	Jan ukasti aka tuqitxa.
I really wanted to help him but I didn't know how.	Jupar yanaptʼañ wal munta ukampis kunjamsa uk janiw yatkti.

He loved her, he knew it now.	Jupax juparux walpun munasïna, jupax jichhax uk yatïna.
He waited for something to happen.	Kunas pasani sasaw suyäna.

But you’re going to be sad.	Ukampis jumax llakitaw jikxatasïta.
He wants to know something.	Jupajj kunsa yatiñ muni.

He had both.	Jupajj panpachaniw utjäna.
But it certainly seems like you can.	Ukampis chiqpachansa jumax ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
He obviously loved it.	Jupajj qhanaw uk wal munäna.

He knew his true cause.	Jupajj kunatsa cheqpach jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.

But he soon finds out.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk yati.
That was all they told me.	Ukakiw jupanakajj sapjjetäna.

That is completely wrong.	Ukajj taqe kunas janiw walïkiti.
I don't want to see that anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp ukham uñjañ munkti.

But it will be the last time.	Ukampis qhep qhepa kutiw ukham lurañapa.
I'm looking forward to seeing them.	Nayax jupanakar uñjañ suyt'askta.

Or, not much worse.	Jan ukajj, janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
Everything is new, new.	Taqi kunas machaq, machaq.

He didn't want to look like he didn't want to.	Jupajj janiw jan munkaspa ukham uñjañ munkänti.
While he was doing this.	Ukham luraskäna ukhajja.
Will leave the area tomorrow.	Qhipürux uka chiqat sarxani.

On the contrary, he actually seemed interesting .	Jan ukasti, chiqpachansa jupax wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa .

But he wasn’t with anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis utjkänti.
He didn't say much of anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns wal siskänti.

But this year there is none.	Ukampis aka marax janiw kunas utjkiti.
A week or so in the summer.	Mä semana jan ukajj mä semanaw verano urun utji.
He was so happy for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Much more much bigger.	Walja juk’ampi juk’ampi jach’a.
A little choppy, someone said something.	Mä juk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi, maynix kuns arsüna.
I don’t think it’s ever better.	Nayax jan kunapachas juk’amp askiwa sasin amuyta.
This lasted three days.	Ukajj kimsa uruw utjäna.
Or he left on his own.	Jan ukajj jupa pachpaw sarjjäna.
I enjoy doing that more.	Uk lurañajj nayatakejj jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
He stole the car.	Jupax auto lunthatasïna.

He really didn’t want to drive anywhere.	Chiqpachansa janiw kawkirus auto apnaqañ munkänti.

There is a time of poison.	Kuna pachas wali suma.

It will definitely be a year.	Chiqpachansa mä maraw utjani.
And let us do what we can to help.	Ukat yanaptʼañatakejj kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañäni.
Now that means exactly what it says.	Jichhax ukax chiqpachapuniw kuntix siski uk sañ muni.
He said he didn't want to go.	Jupajj janiw sarañ munkti sasaw säna.
And he asked himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw jisktʼäna.
He loves that kind of stuff.	Jupax uka kasta yänak walpun munasi.
Here’s what it means.	Akax kuntix sañ munki ukawa.
That was the time I had.	Uka tiempow nayatakejj utjäna.

I really don’t remember it all that much.	Chiqpachansa janiw taqpach ukham amtaskti.

You may want to eat it hot or cold.	Inas junt’u jan ukax thaya manq’añax wakischispa.
I don’t want that here.	Janiw nayax akan ukham munkti.

This was not entirely surprising.	Ukajj janiw taqpach muspharkayätti.
He bought a new house.	Jupax mä machaq uta alasïna.
Everything is kind of .	Taqi kunas mä kasta .
These will need to be done.	Ukanakajj lurañaw wakisini.
He already knew about it.	Jupajj niyaw uka toqet sum yatïna.
It is what he does.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj luraski ukawa.
He was rolling his eyes at me.	Jupajj nayaruw nayranakap uñchʼukiskäna.
You understand what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk jumajj sum amuyasta.
You know, you can do the same for me.	Jumax yatisktawa, jumax nayatakix ukhamarakiw lurasma.
But there is something strange about this.	Ukampis aka tuqitxa kunas muspharkañawa.
Doing it in winter means heavy rain or extreme cold.	Juyphi pachan lurañax wali jallu jan ukax sinti thaya sañ muni.
So somehow I feel better.	Ukhamajj kunjamatsa jukʼamp sum jikjjatasta.
He did it faster.	Jupajj jukʼamp jankʼakiw luräna.
I’m really grateful .	Chiqpachansa, nayax walpun yuspärta .
Someone is in very bad shape.	Maynix wali jan walin jikxatasi.

That is exactly what happened in this case.	Ukaw uka tuqitxa chiqpachapuniw pasäna.

That was amazing, he thought.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I didn’t want a party.	Janiw mä fiesta munkayätti.

You can’t make this kind of stuff up.	Janiw aka kasta yänak lurañjamäkiti.

But he recently bought a new house.	Ukampis jichhakiw mä machaq uta alasïna.

A little bigger than that.	Mä juk’a jach’a ukat sipansa.

It really has nothing to do with me.	Chiqansa, nayatakix janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He left too soon.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw sarjjäna.

Very happy with that.	Wali kusisitaw ukat.

He didn't want to know what was going to happen.	Jupajj janiw kunas pasani uk yatiñ munkänti.

I would love to see another one.	Yaqha uñjañ walpun munta.

He didn’t know where he was going.	Jupax janiw kawkirus puriñ yatkänti.

He thought he knew something, but he didn't know who it was.	Kunsa yattwa sasaw amuyäna, ukampis khitis uk janiw yatkänti.
You are right about the money.	Jumax chiqaw qullqi tuqitxa.

He was very impressed with her.	Jupajj jupar walpun muspharäna.

He didn’t care, he didn’t care.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkänti, janiw kuns lurkänti.

There was nothing secret about him.	Janiw kunas jupat jamasat utjkänti.

He treated her a little better.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sumwa jupar uñjäna.
I don’t want to drink.	Nayax janiw umañ munkti.
He didn't want it to happen to him.	Jupajj janiw jupar pasañap munkänti.
Admittedly, it felt a little uncomfortable.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa jan waliw jikxatasïna.
In this case, .	Uka tuqitxa, .

It was relatively quiet at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, mä jukʼa amukiw jikjjatasïna.
I don’t want to say anything to them.	Nayax janiw kuns jupanakar sañ munkti.
And now it’s almost school again.	Ukat jichhax niyaw yatiqañ utax wasitat purini.

What is the value?.	¿Kunas ukajja?.
He shook it slightly.	Jupax mä juk’a ch’allxtayäna.

There’s something fascinating about this place.	Aka chiqanx mä kunaw wali muspharkañ utji.

But he could do something.	Ukampis kuns luraspänwa.
That’s not good, it’s too obvious.	Ukax janiw askïkiti, sinti qhanawa.

In fact, that is exactly what happened in this case.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw aka tuqitxa pasäna.
The boy was very happy.	Uka waynax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I think this is not the case.	Nayax amuyta akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Of course, it really isn’t possible.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa janiw ukax lurañjamäkiti.
You can do it all next week.	Jutïr semanan taqe ukanak lurasma.

He sees this as a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa jupajj uñji.
The first reason is that it matters.	Nayraqat kunatsa ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He really didn’t want that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk munkänti.
I said it was so.	Nayax ukhamawa sasaw sista.
He does not know exactly why he came.	Jupajj kunatsa jutäna uk janiw sum yatkiti.
It lasts a couple of weeks.	Ukax mä pä semanaw utji.
You can do both.	Panpachaniw lurasma.
He’s doing a good job on his own.	Jupax sapakiw mä suma irnaqäw luraski.
I assured him that would be no problem.	Ukajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw sista.
Of course, you don’t have to go anyway.	Chiqansa, janiw kunjamatsa sarañax wakiskiti.
I didn’t understand anything.	Janiw kuns amuykayätti.
I want to live again.	Nayax wasitat jakañ munta.
And someone stole it.	Ukat mayniw lunthatasïna.
I’m going to go to town.	Nayax markar sarañ amtasta.
It’s better to act quickly.	Jank’ak lurañax wali askiwa.
Well, more and more.	Suma, juk’ampi juk’ampi.
That’s how it’s going to be.	Ukhamaw ukax utjani.
And the other is nothing.	Ukat maynix janiw kunas utjkiti.
But there was something before that.	Ukampis uka nayrajj kunas utjäna.
But today, that was not the case.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
I feel better now, thank you so much.	Jichhax juk’amp sumaw jikxatastxa, walpun yuspärta.
Now, the point is pretty clear.	Jichhax, uka tuqitx wali qhanaw uñjasi.
Sure enough, someone did.	Chiqpachansa, mayniw ukham luräna.
I know something about that.	Uka toqet mä jukʼa yatta.
So we will need something.	Ukhamajj mä kunaw jiwasatak wakisini.
I see it around you now, you know.	Jichhax juma jak’an uñjta, jumax yatisktawa.
Good day after all.	Suma uru taqi kunat sipansa.
And he understood what he was looking at.	Ukat kunas uñchʼukiskäna uk sum amuyäna.
He spoke a little more forcefully.	Jupax mä juk’a ch’amampiw arsüna.
There’s no way to do all of this.	Janiw kunas taqi ukanak lurañax utjkiti.
He was sleeping soundly.	Jupajj wali sumaw ikiskäna.
Last year it never happened.	Nayra marax janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
What he was saying was clear.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Can’t do anything else .	Janiw yaqha tuqit kuns lurkaspati .
He loved the country.	Jupajj uka markaruw munasïna.
But it happened yesterday.	Ukampis qharüruw ukham pasäna.
Nothing really good.	Janiw kunas chiqpachapunix askïkiti.
Time doesn’t do it.	Pachax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
There was room for this.	Ukham lurañatakix mä chiqaw utjäna.
Or he loves it.	Jan ukax walpun munasi.
He told me what we were doing.	Jupaw kuntï lurapkta uk sitäna.
I love it just as much.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw walpun munasta.
I don’t know what that is about.	Nayax janiw kuna tuqitsa ukax yatkti.
A long word.	Mä jaya aru.
And then tell me how it went.	Ukat ukat kunjamsa saräna uk yatiyapxita.
And he didn't say anything for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow jan kuns arskänti.
But nothing about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqitxa.
He wondered how he had treated them so well.	Kunjamsa jupanakar ukham suma uñjäna sasaw jisktʼasïna.
I really don’t mean that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk sañ munkti.
All of this is kind of unnecessary.	Taqi ukax mä juk’a jan wakiskiriwa.
It’s called money.	Ukax qullqi satawa.
Everything had a place.	Taqi kunas mä chiqaw utjäna.
Can you do that? 	¿Ukham lurasmati?
That was about three years ago.	Ukajj niya kimsa maraw pasäna.
But he didn't want to talk to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitimpis parlañ munkänti.
That leaves me alone.	Ukax nayaruw jaytawayi.
But he gave no reason as to why he refused.	Ukampis kunatsa jan iyaw säna uk janiw kunatsa arskänti.
He was asleep now.	Jupajj jichhajj ikiskäna.
And you would be the best.	Ukat jumajj wali askïspawa.
I never knew all that.	Janipuniw ukanak taqe kunsa yatkayätti.
He's a great teacher.	Jupax wali jach'a yatichiriwa.
Now it's not too bad.	Jichhajj janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
I don’t love them.	Janiw jupanakar munaskiti.
Not bad, but not good.	Janiw jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw askïkiti.
Or how that happened.	Jan ukajj kunjamsa ukajj pasäna.
Actually, that’s a bit of a challenge.	Chiqansa, ukax mä juk’a ch’amawa.
He admitted it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk iyaw säna.
It was the last thing he wanted.	Qhip qhipa kuntï jupax munkäna ukawa.
But, I have .	Ukampis, nayajj .
I’ve had it for a long time.	Nayax jaya pachaw ukham jikxatastxa.
That’s how it started.	Ukhamaw qalltäna.
Well, he decided.	Ukhamawa, sasaw jupajj amtäna.
He did not elaborate on it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum arskänti.
The way he was looking at her said so.	Kunjamsa jupar uñchʼukiskäna ukaw ukham säna.
And painfully, he knew it all too well.	Ukat sinti llakitaw uka toqet sum yatïna.
Someone struck it carefully.	Maynix wali amuyumpiw ch’allt’äna.
He thought he might do something a little wrong.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jan walinak luraspa sasaw amuyäna.
You’re so cruel to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali qhuru jaqïtawa.
Maybe one day you’ll need the money soon.	Inas mä urux qullqix jank’akiw munasispa.
But they are very obvious.	Ukampis jupanakajj wali qhanaw uñjasi.
It felt like that twice.	Ukham pä kutiw ukham amuyasïna.
He’s going to be gone soon.	Jupax niyaw sarxani.
I believe I am right.	Nayax chiqaw sasaw amuyasta.
He wanted to know all about it.	Jupajj taqe ukanak yatiñwa munäna.
We still have a few days left.	Jiwasax mä qawqha urunak waliw utjistu.
He knew he didn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj jupar gustkänti, uk sum yatïna.
So everything happened so quickly.	Ukatwa taqe kunas jankʼak pasäna.
I had a great time last night.	Qhipa arumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He never said that to anyone.	Janipuniw khitirus ukham arskänti.
I didn’t yesterday.	Nayax janiw qharürux ukham lurkti.
He had just arrived.	Jichhakiw jupajj purinïna.
That’s what this is about.	Ukaw aka tuqitxa.
And he was looking at me.	Ukat jupajj nayaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
It’s really about to rain.	Chiqpachansa niyaw jallu purini.
At the time he didn’t.	Uka pachanx jupax janiw.
People need time.	Jaqinakax tiempow munasispa.
It never feels necessary.	Janipuniw ukax wakiskiti sasaw amuyasi.
Right here and now.	Chiqaw aka chiqan ukat jichhax.
We need to act faster.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp jankʼak lurañaw wakisi.
I’ve never done that but I want to do that badly.	Janiw kunapachas ukham lurkti ukampis ukham jan walinak lurañ munta.
Maybe half a day.	Inas chika uru.
Two facts struck him.	Pä chiqaw juparux ch’allxtayäna.
It’s quietly great.	Ukax amukiw jach’a jach’a.
A real them.	Mä chiqpach jupanakax.
There will be no other opportunity.	Janiw yaqha oportunidad utjkaniti.
I’m going to leave it here.	Nayax akan jaytañ munta.
I don't do that about it.	Janiw uka tuqitxa ukham lurkti.
These people are beautiful.	Uka jaqinakax wali sumawa.
Of course, you are in a bad mood.	Chiqansa, jumax jan walin jikxatastaxa.
Now that’s not enough for snow alone.	Jichhax ukax janiw ch’uqi sapakix wakiskiti.
It’s a different kind of baseball.	Ukax yaqha kasta béisbol satawa.
This is truly unique.	Chiqpachansa ukax janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
It will take time and effort.	Ukatakejj tiempo ukat kunsa lurañaw wakisini.
It was something he had always dreamed of doing.	Kuntï jupajj nayratpach lurañ amtkäna ukawa.
And again last night.	Ukat wasitat qhipa arumax.
He repeated it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uka toqet wasitat arsüna.
That would be good, too.	Ukax wali askïspawa, ukhamaraki.
Very simple, but amazing.	Wali ch’amawa, ukampis muspharkañawa.
I don't understand that.	Janiw uk sum amuykti.
No, there isn’t anything.	Janiwa, janiw kunas utjkiti.
Great warmth, small space.	Jach’a junt’u, jisk’a chiqa.
It should be done wholeheartedly.	Ukax taqi chuymaw lurañapa.
I don’t intend to focus on that here.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit aka chiqanx chuym churañ amtkti.
And this is evident here.	Ukat aka chiqanx ukax qhanaw uñjasi.
I wonder who he is with now.	Jichhajj khitimpis jupajj utji sasaw jisktʼasta.
Lunch is twice as much.	Chika uru manq’añax pä kutiw ukhama.
Or what she told him.	Jan ukajj kuntï jupar siskäna ukjja.
I want to be very proud.	Nayax wali jach’a jach’a tukuñ munta.
And that’s always the case.	Ukat ukax sapa kutiw utji.
Of course, he can do that.	Chiqansa, jupax ukham luraspawa.
Which, of course, he appreciated.	Ukjja, cheqapuniw jupajj wali askit uñjäna.
He’s still moving.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw sarnaqaski.
That completed the process.	Ukaw uka lurañanak tukuyäna.
This is a long time in tennis.	Akax wali jaya pachaw tenis ukanx utji.
I thought this was kind of bad.	Nayax akax mä juk’a jan waliw sasaw amuyayäta.
A great wine.	Mä jach’a vino.
On the negative side, there is nothing about it.	Uka jan wali tuqitxa, janiw kunas uka tuqitxa utjkiti.
Many times he actually wanted her more.	Walja kutiw chiqpachansa juparux jukʼamp munäna.
I really want to go home immediately.	Chiqansa, jankʼakiw utar sarxañ munta.
And that’s what I find fascinating.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.
He seemed to want to say more, but he didn't.	Jupajj jukʼamp sañ munkaspa ukhamänwa, ukampis janiw arskänti.
That makes me even more upset.	Uk istʼasajj jukʼampiw llakista.
Not a certain amount of time now.	Janiw mä qhawqha tiempojj jichhajj utjkiti.
He was a genuine, good man.	Jupajj cheqpach jaqënwa, suma jaqënwa.
He was just staring at her.	Jupajj jupar sapakiw uñchʼukiskäna.
I still see the real you.	Nayax chiqpach jumax wali uñjta.
He didn't have it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak utjkänti.
When that worked well.	Kunapachatï ukax wali sum lurkäna ukhaxa.
Everything was quieter.	Taqi kunas juk’amp amukiw jikxatasïna.
Time is of the essence of all this.	Tiempojj taqe ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
This is not good, either.	Akax janiw askïkiti, ukhamaraki.
I decided to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurañ amtawayta.
I would love to do it.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw uk lurañ munta.
It was a really good night for me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali suma arumaw utjäna.
No phone charges.	Janiw telefonot qullqix utjkiti.
He seemed eager to share about her.	Jupat yatiyañ wal munkaspa ukhamänwa.
I am so sorry to hear that from him.	Jupat ukham istʼasajj walpun llakista.
That was all he wanted to take.	Ukakiw jupajj apsuñ munäna.
I thank him again.	Jupar wasitat yuspärta.
He was somehow.	Jupajj kunjamatsa ukhamänwa.
He was his own man.	Jupa pachpa jaqënwa.
And that is what happened in this case.	Ukat ukax aka tuqitxa ukhamarakiw pasäna.
There was never that time.	Janipuniw uka tiempojj utjkänti.
About a year later.	Niya mä mara qhepatwa.
So this is .	Ukhamajj aka .
So he decides not to see her again.	Ukatwa jan mayamp uñjañ amti.
I wanted to see him alone for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw jupar uñjañ munta.
Or almost flat.	Jan ukax niya ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I want to live on my own.	Naya pachpaw jakañ munta.
He didn't speak, so she stared at him.	Jan arsüna, ukatwa jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I now know why.	Kunatsa uk jichhajj yattwa.
But he also needs some help.	Ukampis mä jukʼa yanaptʼa munaraki.
Also a warm water.	Ukhamaraki mä junt’u uma.
And it’s really funny.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
A very nice word.	Mä wali suma aru.
I don’t really get it.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix jikxatkti.
Because that’s not something you can do.	Kunatix ukax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
And then the next day everything was quiet.	Ukat ukat qhipürux taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasïna.
I'm still waiting.	Nayax wali suyt'askta.
You have to do it yourself.	Juma pachpaw uka lurañama.
I definitely think this is more fun.	Chiqpachansa akax juk’amp kusiskañawa sasaw amuyta.
Now I know that for sure.	Jichhajj uk sum yatta.
You have to say it’s you.	Jumaw sasaw sañama.
Things are never like that.	Kunanakas janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
We don’t have a final product yet.	Jiwasax janiw mä qhipa yänak jichhakamax utjkiti.
Not exactly a nobody.	Janiw chiqpachapunix mä jan khitis utjkiti.
Finally, the day came when there was nothing else to do.	Qhepatjja, janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti uka uruw purinïna.
That was the case today.	Jichhürunakanjja ukhamänwa.

There are always bad guys out there.	Ukanx sapa kutiw jan wali jaqinakax utji.

The way something feels is the way it feels.	Kunjamtï kunas jikjjatasi ukajj kunjamtï jikjjatasi.
We’re definitely going to have a party.	Jiwasax chiqpachapuniw mä fiesta lurañäni.
I never really wanted to.	Janipuniw chiqpachapunix munkayätti.
Alone, of course, but okay.	Sapakiw, chiqpachansa, ukampis walikïskiwa.
Nowadays, I am doing the same thing.	Jichha tiemponjja, nayajj ukhamarakiw luraskta.
When he asked her to marry him, she agreed.	Kunapachatï jupamp casarasiñatak mayïna ukhajja, iyaw sänwa.
He did it, no, he did that.	Jupax uk luratayna, janiwa, jupax ukham luratayna.
I’ve had it for a few years now.	Jichhax mä qawqha maranakaw ukham jikxatastxa.
I am busy at the moment.	Jichha tiemponjja, jan tiemponiw jikjjatasta.
No one said you were bad.	Janiw khitis jumax jan wali jaqïtawa siskänti.
He immediately explained why he had come.	Kunatsa jutäna uk jankʼakiw yatiyäna.
But it’s exciting at the moment, it’s exciting.	Ukampis jichha pachanx wali kusiskañawa, wali kusiskañawa.
All of which is more to say.	Taqe ukanakajj jukʼamp sañ munta.
And he didn't say anything.	Ukat janiw kuns siskänti.
He definitely didn't say it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jan arskänti.
So it kind of gets to you.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa jumaruw puri.
No, it would be very useful.	Janiwa, wali askïspawa.
He’s been around for a very long time.	Jupax wali jaya pachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
He had no real idea of ​​what to do first.	Jupajj janiw kunsa nayraqat lurañapatak cheqpach amuykänti.
No one is here at noon.	Chika urux janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
At the time, he wanted to know.	Uka tiemponjja, yatiñwa munäna.
In fact, I never really had it.	Chiqansa, janipuniw chiqpachansa ukax utjkitänti.
And he asked about you.	Ukat jumat jisktʼäna.
He’s unknown.	Jupax jan uñt’atawa.
That man never existed.	Uka jaqejj janipuniw utjkänti.
He walked in the park.	Jupax parkin sarnaqäna.
Nothing is that bad.	Janiw kunas ukham jan walïkiti.
He didn't want to buy anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns alañ munkänti.
I don’t really get it.	Janiw chiqpachapunix jikxatkti.
I’ve been here all the time.	Nayax taqi pachaw akanktxa.
He is very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uñji.
He expected her to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañapawa sasaw suyäna.
And they’re him.	Ukat jupanakax juparux.
In fact, there was no problem of any kind.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna kasta jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
That person is good for me.	Uka jaqejj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
But yes, that is not the case.	Ukampis jïsa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.

He wanted to do a lot there.	Ukanjja, walpun lurañ munäna.
And maybe you should.	Ukat inas jumajj ukham lurañama.
He doesn’t work here anymore.	Jupax janiw juk’amp akan irnaqkiti.

But, still .	Ukampis, wali .
What do you need to do’.	Kun lurañas wakisispati’.
He said something very strange.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ arunak arsüna.
This is where he came from.	Akax jupaw jutäna.
But he wants nothing to do with me.	Ukampis janiw nayamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
But somehow he was.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jupajj ukhamänwa.

Well he worked here.	Sumaw jupax akan irnaqäna.
He thought he could do well in that regard.	Uka tuqitxa wali sumwa luraspa sasaw amuyäna.

I want to help him out.	Nayajj jupar yanaptʼañ munta.
No need to make a big deal about it.	Janiw uka toqet mä jachʼa lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn’t say that, of course.	Janiw jupax ukham siskänti, chiqpachansa.
It was a slow motion.	Ukhamaw amuyasïna.
Everything seemed possible.	Taqe kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Don’t give up.	Janiw jaytañamäkiti.
I really, really want to go.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa sarañ munta.
He wanted some alone time.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw munäna.
And that will never happen to you.	Ukat ukax janipuniw jumatakix utjkaniti.

He had noticed it earlier.	Jupajj nayraw uk amuyäna.

In a short period of time.	Mä jukʼa tiemponjja.
That’s actually a big surprise.	Ukax chiqpachansa mä jach’a muspharkañawa.
But that alone isn’t good enough.	Ukampis ukax sapakix janiw askïkiti.

But someone, somewhere, knows.	Ukampis mayniw, kawkhansa, yati.
He’s tough, as he should be.	Jupax wali ch’amawa, kunjamtï lurañapäki ukhama.
And for that matter .	Ukat ukatakix .

Or rather, it matters.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sum sañ muni, ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He’s a very nice guy.	Jupax wali sumaw uñji.

In fact, it feels good to do so.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax wali sumaw jikxatasi.

He didn’t know exactly where to go.	Jupax janiw kawkirus sarañapa ukx sum yatkänti.
Or he didn't do anything.	Jan ukajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
At the time, this is the best thing to do.	Uka tiemponjja, uka lurañaw wali askejja.
He’s not worth it.	Jupax janiw kunäkisa.
I think it’s pretty obvious.	Nayax wali qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
No one can have it all and do it all.	Janiw khitis taqe ukanak utjkaspati ukat taqe kunsa lurkaspati.
But it’s better in the winter.	Ukampis juyphi pachanx juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He doesn't want to see her again.	Jupajj janiw mayamp uñjañ munkiti.
So that's what happens.	Ukhamajj ukham pasaspa.
There's a time more.	Kuna pachas juk'ampi.
No, he didn't understand anything.	Janiwa, janiw kunsa amuykänti.
He didn't know why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw yatkänti.

Whether you can do that or not is beyond your control.	Ukham lurasmati janicha ukax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
But it doesn't mean anything right now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj kuns sañ munkiti.
There is no coffee for me.	Nayatakix janiw mä café utjkiti.

I don't know when that will happen.	Kunapachas ukajj pasani uk janiw yatkti.

He stole a car.	Jupajj mä auto lunthatasïna.

One day a week.	Mä semanan mä uru.
I think that’s always the case.	Nayax amuyta, ukax sapa kutiw ukhama.
Maybe someone else, too.	Inas maynix, ukhamaraki.
He couldn't do it the first time.	Jupajj janiw nayrïr kutin lurañ puedkänti.
This is really funny, actually.	Akax chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa.
You have everything there.	Jumax taqi kunaw ukan utji.
Of course, it doesn't have to be.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
Actually, I want to tell you about it.	Chiqansa, nayax uka tuqit yatiyañ munta.
But let’s do these things.	Ukampis uka jan walinak lurañäni.
But I have a job to do.	Ukampis nayatakejj mä lurañaw utji.
I think, now, now.	Nayax amuyta, jichhax, jichhax.
You don’t have to do too much.	Janiw sinti lurañax wakiskiti.
So he died on the spot.	Ukatwa uka cheqar purisajj jiwjjäna.
There is room for improvement.	Ukanjja, jukʼamp sum lurañatakiw utji.
Whoever did it.	Khitis uk luräna.
He told me he knew.	Jupax yattwa sasaw sitäna.
This is breakfast.	Akax desayuno satawa.

What you do today matters.	Kuntï jichhürunakan lurapkta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Which he denies.	Ukax jupax janiw sasaw arsuwayi.
Where he went and when he went.	Kawkirus saräna ukat kunapachas saräna.
But, it also wants to do bad things.	Ukampis, ukhamarakiw jan walinak lurañ munaraki.
I don't want to say anything more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns sañ munkti.
I listen to it almost every day.	Niya sapa uruw istʼta.
And maybe that’s what you need to do.	Ukat inas ukham lurañax wakischispa.
He started talking to her.	Jupajj jupampiw parltʼañ qalltäna.
He knows how it feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk jupajj sum yati.

Here’s my why.	Akax nayan kunatsa.
I know he will.	Jupajj ukham lurani uk yattwa.
But he barely has anything to do.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼakiw kuna lurañas utji.
I’m thankful for that.	Nayax uka tuqit yuspärta.
It was bad weather, a cold day.	Jan wali pachaw utjäna, thaya uru.

It’s time to know.	Ukax yatiñ pachaw purini.
He couldn't say or do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns siskänti ni lurañsa puedkänti.
I don't like it any more than you do.	Janiw jumanakat sipansa jukʼamp gustkituti.
He didn't say don't do it.	Jupajj janiw jan luramti siskänti.
Not a question is necessary.	Janiw mä jisktʼajj wakiskiti.
He didn't want to talk.	Janiw parlañ munkänti.
He questioned her about it in detail.	Jupajj uka toqet sumwa jupar jisktʼäna.
Of course, this is the first person.	Chiqansa, akax nayrïr jaqiwa.
It took a long time.	Walja tiempow munasïna.
He didn't want to talk for long.	Jupajj janiw jaya tiempo parlañ munkänti.
I can do it all here.	Nayax taqi ukanak aka chiqan lurasmati.
Who does he think he is? 	¿Khitis jupajj amuyi?
He really meant it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk sañ munäna.
I decided that a while ago.	Mä qhawqha tiempo nayraw ukham amtawayta.
Not yes, I don’t.	Janiwa jïsa, janiwa.
This is our kind of guy.	Akax jiwasan kasta waynawa.
You need to act quickly on this.	Uka tuqitxa jankʼakiw lurañama.
But he knows how to play the game.	Ukampis jupax kunjamsa uka anattʼañ yati.
This can happen in two ways.	Ukajj pä toqetwa pasaspa.
I don't want to help him.	Nayajj janiw jupar yanaptʼañ munkti.
But he’s silent.	Ukampis jupax amukiw jikxatasi.
It’s always you, you, you.	Ukax sapa kutiw juma, juma, juma.
I don't know how long that will last.	Ukajj qawqha tiempos pasani uk janiw yatkti.
I’m afraid for you.	Nayax jumatakix axsaratwa.
And it seems to be very pretty.	Ukat wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.
But I don't like him.	Ukampis jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
I know how good that can be.	Nayajj yattwa kunjamsa ukajj wali askïspa.
I don’t party with him.	Nayax janiw jupamp fiestar sarkti.
But that meant nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
I hope you all go.	Nayax taqiniruw sarañ suyt’askta.
He just walked away.	Jupax ukhamakiw sarnaqäna.
He was sleeping too much.	Jupajj sinti ikiskäna.
This person will almost always be the last to leave.	Aka jaqix niya sapa kutiw qhip qhipa sarxani.
There were things we all did.	Kunanaktï taqenis lurapkta ukanakaw utjäna.
But the latter has been rare lately.	Ukampis uka qhip qhipa lurañax aka qhipa urunakanx janiw sinti utjkiti.
I've never been one bit like that.	Janipuniw mä jukʼa ukhamäkti.
But I want to use it.	Ukampis ukanak apnaqañ munta.
I didn’t want to work here.	Janiw akan irnaqañ munkayätti.
But he looks awesome, which is amazing.	Ukampis jupax wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa, ukax muspharkañawa.
There he was happier.	Ukanjja, jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He will come for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jutani.
I want to live in this one.	Nayax aka maynix jakañ munta.
I’d be happy to give it.	Nayax wali kusisitaw uk churañ munta.
But he goes anyway.	Ukampis jupax kunjamatsa saraski.
And he thought that was important.	Ukat ukax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyäna.
I didn’t have to go any further.	Janiw juk’ampi sarañax wakiskänti.
They can’t do anything about it.	Jupanakax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Therefore, the whole time .	Ukatwa, taqpach tiempojj .
He felt that he would come very soon.	Jupajj wali jankʼakiw jutani sasaw amuyasïna.
He sees power and he wants it.	Jupax ch’am uñji ukat uka ch’am munaraki.
I needed time to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak lurañatakix tiempox munasïna.
But don't be a bad guy.	Ukampis janiw jan walinak lurañamäkiti.
He was watching the door carefully now.	Jupajj jichhajj punku sum uñchʼukiskäna.
It doesn’t matter what happened now.	Jichhax kunas pasäna ukax janiw kunäkisa.
It feels like this every day.	Sapa uruw ukham jikxatasi.

That doesn't mean a thing.	Ukajj janiw mä kuns sañ munkiti.
Not all nothing, of course.	Janiw taqpach jan kunas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
He told me it wasn’t good enough.	Jupax janiw askïkiti sasaw sitäna.
This is always great.	Akax sapa kutiw jach’a.

It was a terrible time.	Mä jan wali pachaw utjäna.

You think you know everything.	Jumax taqi kun yatisktawa sasaw amuyta.
And somehow, he never would.	Ukat kunjamatsa, janipuniw ukham lurkaspati.
But I never knew better.	Ukampis janipuniw jukʼamp sum yatkayätti.
Almost without much reason.	Niya jan sinti kunatsa.
I think we need to do a better job.	Nayax amuyta, juk’amp suma irnaqäw lurañaw wakisi.
It’s all interesting in some way.	Taqi kunas mä kasta tuqitx wali askiwa.
He did the work.	Jupaw uka lurañanak luräna.
Because he’s always there.	Kunatix jupax sapa kutiw ukan jikxatasi.

A man does not want everything.	Mä chachajj janiw taqe kunsa munaskiti.

There is a cafe on site.	Uka chiqanx mä café ukaw utji.

What do you want to do with that?.	¿Kunsa jumajj ukham lurañ munta?.
All of these are better.	Taqi ukanakax juk’amp askiwa.
But it will get to you.	Ukampis jumaruw purini.
I don’t want to repeat it.	Janiw nayax wasitat arsuñ munkti.
I never saw these before.	Janipuniw ukanak nayraqat uñjkti.
You tell us more about it.	Jumax uka tuqit jukʼamp yatiyapxita.
You can’t do that much.	Janiw ukham walja lurañas utjkaspati.
Nobody likes them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar gustkiti.
But somehow, no one can believe it.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, janiw khitis iyaw sañjamäkiti.
I am really passionate about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
That was the talk of the convention.	Ukaw uka jachʼa tantachäwin parläna.
That felt better.	Ukaw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasïna.
And that’s really what it means.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax sañ muni.
That means it’s individual.	Ukax sapa mayniw sañ muni.
I was really surprised that it worked.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw muspharta.
Maybe you need to eat a little, too.	Inas mä juk’a manq’añax wakischispa, ukhamaraki.
So he started walking.	Ukatwa jupajj sarnaqañ qalltäna.
Except now, of course.	Jan ukasti jichhax, chiqpachansa.
More, worse, actually.	Jila, juk’amp jan wali, chiqpachansa.
We love to do things.	Jiwasajj kunsa lurañas wal gustitu.
I really miss him and I miss him.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasta ukat llakistwa.

Everything is all good.	Taqi kunas taqi kunas wali sumawa.
And, I’m happy to do so.	Ukat, ukham lurañax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
Then, two days later, it happened.	Ukat pä uru qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I knew exactly where it came from.	Kawkitsa jutäna uk sum yatiyäta.
Everything happened before.	Taqi kunas nayraw pasäna.
He didn't want to talk about her.	Jupajj janiw jupat kunsa parlañ munkänti.
In fact, he refused to work again.	Chiqansa, wasitatwa jan irnaqañ munkänti.
I said both of them.	Nayax panpachaniw sista.
He was quiet and awkward.	Jupajj amukiw ukat jan wali jaqënwa.
But none of this .	Ukampis janiw kunas uka .
I will have it all.	Nayajj taqe ukanakaw utjani.
I don't know how to do it that well now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham sum lurañ yatkti.
He saw her immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar uñjäna.
What he says is that.	Kuntï siski ukajja.
Therefore , it is not	Ukhamajj janiw .
I want more stuff to come.	Nayax juk’amp yänak jutañ munta.
He was something other than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa yaqha ukhamänwa.
It didn’t exist before.	Janiw nayrax utjkänti.
He wants to use force.	Jupax ch’amampiw apnaqañ muni.
I said it was a day.	Nayax mä uruw sista.
So do as you please.	Ukhamajj kunjamtï munkta ukham luram.
Almost two years.	Niya pä mara.
You are a wonderful teacher.	Jumax wali suma yatichiriwa.
Or he thought he knew.	Jan ukajj jupajj yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
He’s given up on that chance.	Jupax uka ch’amampiw jaytawayi.
You’re in a big mess.	Jumax mä jach’a jan walt’äwin jikxatastaxa.
You should never do these things.	Janipuniw ukanak lurañamäkiti.
But not this afternoon.	Ukampis janiw jichha tardejj ukhamäkiti.
I did everything right.	Taqe kunsa sumwa lurayäta.
Actually, let’s be honest.	Chiqansa, chiqapar uñjañäni.
So it never matters.	Ukhamajj janipuniw kunäkisa.
I said it was fine.	Nayax walikïskiwa sasaw sista.
Do you want to be like that?.	¿Jumajj ukham munasmati?.
In fact, he really felt that way.	Chiqansa, chiqpachapuniw jupax ukham jikxatasïna.
Great, great, great.	Jach’a, jach’a, jach’a.
He was the problem.	Jupaw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
I don’t understand anything about him.	Jupat janiw kuns amuykti.
No one wanted to live there.	Janiw khitis ukan jakañ munkänti.
That was what he felt good about.	Ukaw jupajj wali sum jikjjatasïna.
And it really doesn’t.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkiti.
But now the truth is coming to you.	Ukampis jichhajj kunatï cheqäki ukajj jumaruw purini.
I’ve had it for about a week now.	Jichhax niya mä semanaw ukham jikxatastxa.
Would you like to talk to me on the phone.	¿Jumax nayamp telefonot parltʼañ munasmati.
So not really .	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun .
And I know exactly why.	Ukat kunatsa uk sum yatta.
It really doesn’t work that well.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham sum irnaqkiti.
Everything is really fascinating.	Taqi kunas chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.
He worked in two ways.	Jupajj pä toqetwa irnaqäna.
You never knew where anyone was.	Janipuniw kawkhans khitis uk yatkayätati.
And obviously it was here.	Ukat qhanaw akanx ukhamänwa.
For a long time he couldn't.	Mä jaya tiempojj janiw puedkänti.
But that was something else for me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj yaqha ukhamänwa.
He didn't do his homework.	Jupajj janiw tareanak lurkänti.
You will feel really, really fast.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jankʼakiw jikxatasïta.
So no time is needed!.	¡Ukhamajj janiw tiempojj wakiskiti!.
He hasn’t done that in years.	Jupax walja maranakaw jan ukham lurkiti.
You don’t have to go anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha chiqar sarañax wakiskiti.
I think you would like it.	Jumax munasmati sasaw amuyta.
It’s pretty much the last time.	Ukax niyaw qhipa pachanx utji.
I wonder how he feels.	Kunjamsa jupajj jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasta.
But, then something good happened.	Ukampis, ukat mä sumaw pasäna.
There isn’t much to do about the former.	Nayrïr tuqitx janiw sinti lurañax utjkiti.
He didn't want to say anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa sañ munkänti.
Everyone knows how to do that.	Taqinipuniw ukham lurañ yatipxi.
There is nothing wrong with such and such.	Ukham ukham lurañax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
That’s a real person.	Ukax chiqpach jaqiwa.
He worked for a year.	Jupax mä maraw irnaqäna.

It means living on a coin.	Ukajj mä qollqe jakañ sañ muni.
I really want to know how to do everything.	Chiqpachansa kunjamsa taqi kun lurañ yatiñ munta.
He’s got a good look.	Jupax mä suma uñnaqaniwa.
He’s the reason.	Jupaw kunatsa.
Another guy did exactly the same thing.	Yaqha waynax pachpa chiqpachapuniw luratayna.
That's what I thought.	Ukhamaw nayajj amuyayäta.
You don’t want to be that person, do you?.	Jumax janiw uka jaqir tukuñ munktati, ¿janich ukhamäki?.
But it was too late.	Ukampis wali qhepatwa.
But I don't understand your point.	Ukampis janiw jumanakan kuntï siskta uk amuykti.
He didn't really know for sure.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun sum yatkänti.
So maybe I should go now.	Ukhamaw inas jichhax sarañax wakischispa.
Someone either knows or doesn’t.	Maynix yati jan ukax janiw yatkiti.
He went every year.	Jupajj sapa maraw saräna.
It was doing quite well.	Ukajj wali sumwa luraskäna.
I really don’t know how to do it any other way.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha tuqit lurañ yatkti.
I still feel sad and depressed.	Wali llakitaw jikjjatasta ukat llakitaw jikjjatasta.
That’s how we’ll see.	Ukhamaw uñjañäni.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.
He started his car.	Jupax autop qalltäna.
That’s a terrible surprise.	Ukax wali axsarkañ muspharkañawa.

It’s hard but it’s definitely worth it.	Ch’amawa ukampis chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
There is no university.	Janiw jach’a yatiqañ utax utjkiti.
I never want that again.	Janipuniw mayampsa uk munkti.

And it’s worth every penny.	Ukat sapa qullqix wali askiwa.
He didn't know why or how.	Kunatsa ni kunjamsa uk janiw yatkänti.
He didn’t want anyone, he didn’t want anything.	Janiw khitirus munkänti, janiw kunsa munkänti.
He didn't know that.	Ukjja jupajj janiw yatkänti.
I think there is nothing.	Nayax amuyta, janiw kunas utjkiti.
Now you have to do it again.	Jichhax wasitat lurañaw wakisi.

But it kind of feels that way.	Ukampis mä juk’a ukham jikxatasi.
I prefer to do that.	Nayajj ukham lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
But that doesn't matter at all.	Ukampis ukajj janipuniw kunäkisa.
That’s the kind of guy he is.	Uka kasta waynax jupax ukhamawa.
They mean nothing to me.	Jupanakajj nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.

Well, this isn’t the case.	Ukhama, akax janiw ukhamäkiti.

For me, I want to eat more than I can take out.	Nayatakix kunanaktï apsuñ munkta ukat sipansa jukʼampiw manqʼañ munta.

Now he sees more.	Jichhax juk’amp uñji.

He threw her into it.	Jupajj ukaruw jupar jaqontäna.
It’s really amazing how effective it can be.	Chiqpachansa, kunjamsa ukax wali askïspa ukax wali muspharkañawa.

And he decided to do better.	Ukat jukʼamp sum lurañwa amtäna.
He declined to say why.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa ukham amuyki uk arskänti.

But it wasn’t there.	Ukampis janiw utjkänti.
He doesn’t understand anything, really.	Jupax janiw kuns amuykiti, chiqpachansa.
A little bit of a different kind.	Mä juk’a yaqha kasta.
Of course he doesn’t.	Chiqansa jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
They are awesome!.	¡Jupanakax wali muspharkañawa!.
And it started working, too.	Ukat ukax irnaqañ qalltäna, ukhamaraki.
Everything seemed strange and sinister.	Taqe kunas muspharkañ ukat jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
and everything else.	ukat taqi kuna.
This is very important, after all.	Akax wali wakiskiriwa, taqi kunat sipansa.
All alone in the room.	Taqi kunas sapakiw uka cuarto ukanx utji.
Now you know what you’re doing.	Jichhax jumax yatisktawa.
Both have happened many times.	Panpachaniw walja kutiw pasäna.
No one seems to know what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkaspa ukhama.
But, he said he didn't remember that.	Ukampis, janiw uk amtkti sasaw säna.
This is good, this is all good.	Akax wali askiwa, akax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
Nothing is ever good enough.	Janiw kunas kunapachas askïkiti.
These are all good things.	Ukanakajj taqe kunas wali askiwa.
Maybe they’re pretty nearly, you know.	Inas jupanakax wali niya, jumax yatisktawa.
But I didn't know exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum yatkayätti.
So he spoke up.	Ukatwa jupajj parläna.
Now I needed to do better.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisïna.
Would you like to know more?.	¿Jukʼamp yatiñ munasmati?.
He was very happy about it.	Uka tuqitxa jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Tell me more about where you come from.	Kawkitsa jutta uk juk’amp yatiyapxita.
He wanted to be very proud.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jachʼa tukuñ munäna.
Tell me where I went wrong.	Kawkhantï jan wal lurkta uk yatiyapjjeta.
Your true self.	Chiqpach juma pachpa.
We’ll see how it feels.	Jiwasax kunjams jikxatasi uk uñjañäni.
That is not even the problem.	Ukajj janiw uka jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He said it was the same day.	Uka pachpa uruw sasaw säna.
This is necessary all the time.	Ukajj taqe tiempow wakisi.
He’s more of a real guy.	Jupax juk’amp chiqpach waynawa.
I don’t know if such a one exists.	Ukham maynix utjaspa ukx janiw yatkti.
He’s a great guy there.	Jupax ukanx mä jach’a jaqiwa.
He's going to go there.	Jupajj ukaruw saraski.
I don’t intend to do that.	Janiw ukham amtkti.
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk janiw yatkti.
I know what he really thinks.	Kuntï jupajj cheqpachapun amuyki uk sum yatta.
I never saw a penny.	Janipuniw mä qullqis uñjkti.
I heard him talk about it.	Jupar uka toqet parlir istʼta.
He uses it on the police.	Jupax policiaruw ukanak apnaqi.
That and what makes it so exciting.	Ukax ukat kunatix wali kusiskañawa.
He saw the problem firsthand.	Jupajj uka jan waltʼäwejj jupa pachpaw uñjäna.
That was the whole process.	Ukhamaw taqpach lurañax utjäna.
So, really, this was pretty cool.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa, akax wali sumapunïnwa.
I did really well, actually.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa lurawayta, chiqpachansa.
It came several times.	Ukajj walja kutiw jutäna.
It did nothing for me.	Ukajj janiw kuns nayatakejj lurkänti.
No one can do this alone.	Janiw khitis sapaki uk lurkaspati.
Not yet, not now.	Janiw jichhakamax utjkiti, janiw jichhax utjkiti.
I’m going to go there.	Nayax ukaruw sarä.
Do it for him.	Jupar luram.
He’ll leave the place.	Jupax uka chiqat sarxani.
No, not really .	Janiwa, janiw chiqpachansa .
I have no idea how he got them.	Kunjamsa jupanakar katoqäna uk janiw amuykti.

And unique, he told himself.	Ukat janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
Of course, this is the only thing you want.	Chiqansa, ukax sapa mayniw munasispa.
I don't appreciate them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar askit uñjkti.
There was none, and it went quickly.	Janiw utjkänti, ukat jankʼakiw saräna.
He really didn’t want to know about it.	Chiqpachansa jupax janiw uka tuqit yatxatañ munkänti.
What happened next was even better.	Kunatï uka qhepat paskäna ukajj jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
A beautiful, rough stone.	Mä suma, qhuru qala.
Maybe you want to get in here.	Inas jumax aka tuqit mantañ munsta.
He’s just so, so nice.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali, wali suma jaqiwa.
But it will be a while.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempow utjani.
He didn’t do that here.	Aka chiqanx janiw ukham lurkänti.
There is nothing wrong with doing it during the day.	Urun tiempon lurañajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Now,  .	Jichha, .
That's what he knows best.	Ukaw jupajj wali sum yati.
My everything and I always.	Nayan taqi kunas ukat nayax sapa kutiw.
I really didn’t want to.	Chiqpachansa janiw munkayätti.
It came along quite nicely.	Ukajj wali sumwa jutäna.
There will be a nice breeze.	Ukanx mä suma thaya utjani.
That will be something to do.	Ukajj kuna lurañas utjani.
The way you are doing it is wrong.	Kunjamtï lurapkta ukajj janiw walïkiti.
He says it’s not necessary.	Jupax janiw wakiskiti sasaw saraki.
Not anywhere .	Janiw kawkhans .
But it will be longer for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj jukʼamp jaya tiempow utjani.
And he did it every day.	Ukat sapa uruw ukham luräna.
He did more than that.	Jupajj jukʼampiw luräna.
But that was all we had left.	Ukampis ukakiw jiwasatak qheparäna.
I never wanted that.	Janipuniw uk munkayätti.
Once in a while it’s worth it.	Mä kutix wali askiwa.
Such a small amount.	Ukham jisk’a qullqi.
Date  .	Uru .
But it is obvious.	Ukampis qhanaw amuyasi.
For me, maybe.	Nayatakix inas.
And it’s still unknown.	Ukat wali jan uñt’atawa.
But he didn't understand anything.	Ukampis janiw mä kunsa amuykänti.
How you feel about yourself matters.	Kunjamsa juma pachpat amuyasta ukajj wali wakiskiriwa.
So he is doubly in trouble.	Ukhamajj pä kutiw jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
Now, let’s get things straight.	Jichhax, kuns chiqapar uñjañäni.
All of these things he did.	Taqi ukanak luräna.
I have seen this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk sum uñjta.
So it's not like that at all.	Ukhamajj janiw kunjamatsa ukhamäkiti.
I’m very impressed with him.	Nayax jupat walpun muspharta.
He was happily sleeping.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw ikiskäna.
At noon she had herself.	Chika urux jupax jupa pachpaw utjäna.
I tried not to do that.	Jan ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiyäta.
He told us about it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uka toqet yatiyäna.
I think it’s worth the money.	Nayatakix uka qullqix wali askiwa.
Really, really not.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
And, it’s really good.	Ukat, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
No one wants him there.	Janiw khitis jupar ukan munkiti.
Of course .	Ukhamawa .
Not at all, not at all.	Janiw kunatsa, janiw kunatsa.
Therefore, it is understood.	Ukatwa amuyasïna.
The process is amazing.	Uka lurañajj wali muspharkañawa.
I know that very well.	Ukjja wali sum yatta.
Or whatever it may be about.	Jan ukax kuna tuqitsa ukham lurañax wakisispa.
So far that hasn’t worked.	Jichhakamax ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
It doesn't matter if he knows or not.	Jupajj yatkaspa jan ukajj jan yatkaspa ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
You know about him.	Jumajj jupat yatisktawa.
That's what I ended up with.	Ukaw nayajj tukuyäna.
He was cold and sad.	Jupajj thaya ukat llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
How he felt about it.	Kunjamsa jupax jikxatasïna.
The boy loves to eat.	Uka waynax manq’añ wal muni.
He stayed there for hours.	Jupajj walja horanakaw ukan qheparäna.
No one was home.	Janiw khitis utax utjkänti.
You can’t have the same house.	Janiw pachpa utax utjkaspati.
Of course, he said.	Chiqansa, sasaw säna.
He gave it all to me.	Jupaw taqe ukanak churitu.
No one had said that.	Janiw khitis ukham sasaw siskänti.
He lived with her.	Jupampiw jakasïna.
I think that’s exactly what you want.	Nayax amuyta, ukax chiqpachapuniw kuntix jumax munkta ukawa.
A cold night outside.	Mä thaya arumaw anqan.

And yes, tomorrow is going to be a big day.	Ukat jïsa, qharürojj wali jachʼa uruw utjani.
He’s very important.	Jupax wali wakiskiriwa.
These are obvious.	Ukanakajj qhanaw uñjasi.
And he repeated it again and again.	Ukat mayamp mayamp arsüna.
I really love this one.	Chiqpachansa aka tuqitxa walpun munasta.
I don’t know, really.	Nayax janiw yatkti, chiqpachansa.
All of these will be needed.	Taqe ukanakaw munasini.
He grunted, not knowing what to make of it all.	Jupax qhuru arsüna, janiw kuns taqi ukanak lurañap yatkänti.
Of course, he didn’t need to.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw wakiskänti.
He loved it that much.	Jupajj ukham wal munasïna.
But I’d rather not do that.	Ukampis jan ukham lurañax nayatakix wali askiwa.
These are now.	Ukanakax jichhax.
He told me there wasn’t.	Jupax janiw utjkiti sasaw sitäna.
He was a completely different person.	Jupajj taqpach yaqha jaqënwa.
But I can’t tell anyone that.	Ukampis janiw khitirus ukham sañjamäkiti.
What we did last night was .	Kuntï nayra arumax lurapkta ukax .
Everything looks tiny.	Taqi kunas jisk’a jisk’a uñtatawa.
He was a cold man.	Jupajj thaya jaqënwa.
I decided to use them here.	Nayax jupanakar akan apnaqañ amtawayta.
But that is already a problem.	Ukampis ukajj niyaw mä jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
It wasn’t that bad here.	Janiw ukham jan wali lurañax akan utjkänti.
He got what he needed.	Jupajj kunatï wakiski uk katoqäna.
But that was not the case at the time.	Ukampis uka tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
All of these are what you need.	Taqe ukanakaw munasispa.
He knew exactly why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham pasäna uk sum yatïna.
It’s funny about him.	Jupat wali muspharkañawa.
He didn't know why.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkänti.
After that, he left immediately.	Uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
He knew it was going to happen.	Ukajj pasañap yatïna.
Every day	Sapa uruw .
I went to the right.	Ukaruw sarawayta.
It’s a bit of a rough guy.	Mä juk’a qhuru jaqiwa.
So far he’s been pretty good.	Jichhakamax jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
Or he didn't think so.	Jan ukajj janiw ukham amuykänti.
I decided to do it.	Nayax uk lurañ amtawayta.
That is already happening at some point.	Ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj niyaw pasaski.
He can only exist once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw utjaspa.
But the reality was different.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
You look like a great guy.	Jumax wali jach’a jaqir uñtatawa.
I think he’s a great guy.	Nayax jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa sasaw amuyta.
He said he never said that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk siskti sasaw säna.
Which is why he’s so excited, of course.	Ukax kunatix jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
I would like to say the following.	Nayax akham arunak arsuñ munta.
He did this a little too late.	Ukjja mä jukʼa qhepatwa luräna.
This kind of thing didn’t last long.	Aka kasta lurañax janiw jaya tiempox utjkänti.
Of course he drives a lot.	Chiqansa jupax walja auto apnaqi.
No one will do it for us.	Janiw khitis jiwasatak lurkaniti.
It was after dinner.	Ukajj manqʼañ qhepatwa pasäna.
I had no choice.	Nayax janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
There was one behind him.	Jupa qhepatjja mayniw utjäna.
He said he would do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa lurani sasaw säna.
Let's see if he's okay.	Jupajj walikïskiti janicha uk uñjañäni.
Then he began to tell me how, and why.	Ukat kunjamsa, ukat kunatsa uk yatiyañ qalltäna.
What does this mean here.	Kunas akax akham sañ muni.
I hope I do that myself.	Naya pachpaw ukham lurañax suytʼta.

You know, it’s funny.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukax wali muspharkañawa.

The snowflakes are cut into pieces.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I want to go to yours.	Nayax jumanakan ukar sarañ munta.

He’s got his house.	Jupax utaparuw puri.
Always wants the last word.	Sapa kutiw qhipa aru munaraki.
He drove home.	Jupajj autot utaparuw sarjjäna.
You can do awesome stuff there.	Ukanx wali muspharkañ yänak lurasma.
I still know nothing about him.	Jichhakamajj janiw jupat kuns yatkti.
Something a little cooler then now.	Kunas mä juk’a thaya ukat jichhax.
He lived alone in this house.	Jupax sapakiw aka utan jakasïna.
That’s exciting in itself.	Ukax pachpa kusiskañawa.
He worked outside for two years.	Pä maraw anqan irnaqäna.
He is the only one who rules.	Jupa sapakiw apnaqi.
It doesn’t cost you anything.	Ukax janiw kuna qullqis jumatakix utjkiti.
Better than that place, actually.	Uka chiqat sipansa juk’amp suma, chiqpachansa.

Overall a very good day.	Taqi kunat sipansa mä wali suma uru.
But he had nowhere to go.	Ukampis janiw kawkirus sarañapatak utjkänti.
Because it’s so hard today.	Kunatix jichhürunakanx wali ch’amawa.
The same thing happened three weeks ago.	Kimsa semana nayrajj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
In terms of food though.	Manq’añ tuqitxa ukampis.
To his surprise, they were not.	Jupanakajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj wal muspharäna.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Jupax janiw ukham lurañ munkiti.
Except for one afternoon.	Jan ukasti mä tardejj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But then it doesn't work.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw walïkiti.
I really, really enjoyed my time with him.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jupamp chika tiempox wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
That’s the reason he came.	Ukaw kunatsa jupax jutäna.
You should do the same!.	¡Jumax ukhamarakiw lurañama!.
She’s an amazingly amazing woman.	Jupax wali muspharkañ muspharkañ warmiwa.
Now about this.	Jichhax aka tuqitxa.

Absolutely, I think.	Chiqpachansa, nayax amuyta.
It’s not like it is today.	Janiw jichhürunakan utjki ukhamäkiti.
But he gets one thing right.	Ukampis jupax mä kunwa chiqapar uñji.
No problem, he says.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti, sasaw saraki.

He was surprised by it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal muspharäna.
There is never a problem.	Janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I know exactly what I’m capable of.	Nayax sum yatta kuntix nayax lurañjamäki uk.

But the problem is trivial.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw kunäkisa.
I’m already saying.	Nayax niyaw sista.

This is a very big chance.	Akax mä wali jach’a ch’amawa.
Anyway, he will do it.	Kawkhansa, jupax uk lurani.
I really want to do that.	Chiqpachansa uk lurañ munta.
I am a woman myself.	Naya pachpa warmiwa.
I don’t want to tell you.	Nayax janiw yatiyañ munkti.
I didn't want to rush him.	Janiw jupar jankʼak lurañ munkayätti.
He takes care of the ball.	Jupaw pelot anattʼañ uñji.

It’s called the snow.	Ukax ch’uqi satawa.

There’s always someone there, too.	Sapa kutiw maynix ukanx, ukhamaraki.
I was still happy to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
So, this is exactly what it’s about.	Ukhama, akax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
And how I feel that way.	Ukat kunjamsa ukham jikjjatasta.
Now tell me something.	Jichhax mä kuns yatiyapxita.

But there is one little thing he wanted to do to you.	Ukampis mä jiskʼa kunaw utji, jupajj jumar lurañwa munäna.
This happened many times.	Ukham lurañajj walja kutiw pasäna.

I wasn’t the only one.	Janiw nayajj ukhamäkänti.
I started a new life today.	Jichhürunakan machaq jakañ qalltawayta.

I just made a new one.	Jichhakiw mä machaq lurawayta.

He said that it didn't matter.	Jupajj ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw säna.
I don’t however want to do this.	Nayax janiw ukampis uk lurañ munkti.
That’s what the guy did.	Ukhamaw uka waynax luratayna.
But here, and the school has been around for a few years.	Ukampis akham, ukat yatiqañ utax mä qawqha maranakaw utji.
Let me know when and where.	Kunapachas ukat kawkhansa yatiyapxita.
It is better than he is now.	Jichhajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Maybe you can do better.	Inas jumajj jukʼamp sum lurasma.
Maybe it’s not worth it.	Inas jan walinak lurañax wakiskiti.
Everything he did was successful.	Taqe kuntï lurkäna ukajj wali sumwa luräna.
I promise he will.	Jupajj uk lurani sasaw arsuwayta.
He went home to his bedroom.	Jupax utaparuw ikiñ utapar sarxäna.
Instead, he was watching intently.	Jan ukasti, wali amuyumpiw uñchʼukiskäna.
I don't like that at all.	Ukajj janiw kunjamatsa gustkiti.
You don’t think it’s good for you.	Jumax janiw jumatakix askïkiti sasaw amuyta.
No one didn’t like him.	Janiw khitis jupar jan gustkänti.
And you, with him.	Ukat jumax, jupamp chika.
You rarely do that.	Jumax jukʼakiw ukham lurasma.
I usually use both.	Nayax panpachaniw apnaqañ yatta.
He does it many times.	Walja kutiw uk luri.

But he didn't like it very much.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sinti gustkänti.
After me.	Nayan qhepatjja.
That’s exactly what happened.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunas pasäna.
But he felt good about it.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatasïna.
But the point is .	Ukampis uka tuqitxa .
And tell him yourself.	Ukat juma pachpaw jupar yatiyañama.
It doesn’t necessarily mean there will be a future.	Janiw chiqpachapunix jutïr pachax utjkaniti sañ munkiti.
And he said it with great force.	Ukat wali chʼamampiw uk säna.
It is eerily quiet.	Ukajj wali muspharkañ amukiw jikjjatasi.
It’s a great little shape.	Ukax mä jach’a jisk’a uñtatawa.
Isn’t it still cold?.	¿Janit wali thaya?.
So it feels good .	Ukhamajj wali sumaw jikjjatasi .
He thought he was terrified of everything.	Jupajj taqe kun uñjasajj walpun ajjsaräna sasaw amuyäna.
No one wants to help them.	Janiw khitis jupanakar yanaptʼañ munkiti.
The past is now.	Nayra pachax jichhax.

But it doesn’t exist yet, either.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax utjkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.

Today, there is every reason to do so.	Jichhürunakanjja, taqe kunatsa ukham lurañatakejj utji.

Rebuilding will take years.	Wasitat lurañax walja maranakaw munasini.

But there is one more thing.	Ukampis mä jukʼampiw utji.
And everything is fine.	Ukat taqe kunas walikïskiwa.
This is the case at the moment.	Akax jichha pachanx ukhamawa.
Or at least one needs to be done.	Jan ukajj mä lurañaw wakisi.

There will be no school tomorrow.	Qhipürux janiw yatiqañ utax utjkaniti.

He expected more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw suyäna.
I really hope that never happens.	Chiqpachansa, janipuniw ukham lurañax utjkaniti sasaw suytʼaskta.
Cold, slow voice.	Thaya, ch’uqi aru.
He said nothing to help her.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupar yanaptʼañatakejj siskänti.
It’s constantly moving all the time.	Ukax sapa kutiw taqi pachan sarnaqaski.
And then one day came yesterday.	Ukat ukat mä urux qharüruw puri.
Why, everyone knows what you’re doing.	Kunatsa, taqiniw kuntix lurapkta uk yatipxi.
There was something worse.	Ukanjja jukʼamp jan waliw utjäna.
He is my everything.	Jupaw nayan taqe kunat sipansa.
It’s silent.	Ukax amukiw.
I’m just going to keep going.	Nayax ukhamakiw saraskta.
They are really interesting.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I didn’t want to see them.	Janiw jupanakar uñjañ munkayätti.
He speaks very loudly.	Jupax wali jach’a arunak arsu.
In this case, it’s wrong.	Uka tuqitxa, janiw walïkiti.
He’s determined to do so.	Jupax ukaruw amti.
I want to eat both.	Panpachaniw manqʼañ munta.
Where did he get the money.	Kawkitsa uka qullqi apsüna.
I give a lot of it.	Nayax walpun churta.
Much to everyone’s surprise, it hit hard.	Taqiniruw wal muspharäna, ukax wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
There’s nothing, there’s nothing!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkiti, ¡janiw kunas utjkiti!.
I want to buy every item.	Nayax sapa yänak alañ munta.
No one knows yet.	Janiw khitis jichhakamax uk yatkiti.
A school is what happens.	Mä yatiqañ utax kunatix luraski ukawa.
You are not allowed, you are not allowed, you are not allowed.	Jumax janiw satawa, jumax janiw satawa, jumax janiw satawa.
It’s worse now, of course.	Jichhax juk’amp jan waliw, chiqpachansa.
I have promised him many times.	Nayajj walja kutiw jupar arsuwayta.
I know where we are riding.	Nayajj kawkirus kayuk sarapjjta uk yattwa.
He wanted to do these things.	Jupajj ukanak lurañwa munäna.
I don't care what you say.	Kuntï jumajj siskta ukajj janiw nayatak wakiskiti.
At the time, it seemed like a good idea.	Uka tiemponjja, wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
Large chunks of cotton wool.	Jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
And obviously not.	Ukat qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.
That really ended it for me.	Ukaw nayatakejj cheqapuniw tukuyäna.
There is a	Kunas utji .
Or, really, do it.	Jan ukax, chiqpachansa, lurañaw wakisi.
It stuck with me for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempow nayar chʼalljjtayasïna.
I have only one.	Nayax mä sapakiw utjitu.
I kind of understand why.	Kunatsa uk mä jukʼa amuyasta.
A lot happened fast.	Walja kunas jankʼakiw pasäna.
I mean almost tonight.	Nayax niya jichha arumax sañ munta.
I was very happy, yes.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta, jïsa.
I’m not that for it.	Nayax janiw ukatakix ukhamäkti.
And there’s some truth to that, yes.	Ukat ukax mä juk’a chiqaw utji, jïsa.
I don’t want to leave the country.	Janiw nayax markat sarxañ munkti.
He hit it and she hit it.	Jupax ch’allt’äna ukat jupax ch’allt’äna.
He knew nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet kunsa yatkänti.
He said he didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet yatkti sasaw säna.
So, first day of school.	Ukhama, yatiqañ utan nayrïr uru.
He likes a surprise.	Juparux mä muspharkañ lurañaw gusti.
That’s what you .	Ukax jumax .
It’s time to act on it.	Uka tuqit lurañ pachaw purini.
It just means that.	Ukajj ukhamakiw sañ muni.
Didn't really mean that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham sañ munkänti.
You must do it!.	¡Ukham lurañamawa!.
It doesn’t matter if someone doesn’t exist.	Maynix jan utjki ukax janiw wakiskiti.
Of course, all of this is good.	Chiqansa, taqi ukanakax wali askiwa.
So that was a year.	Ukhamajj ukajj mä maraw pasäna.
Would you like to do more?.	¿Jukʼamp lurañ munasmati?.
He knows more than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼampiw yati.
I know it’s very difficult.	Nayax yattwa wali ch’amawa.
That’s none of this.	Ukax janiw kunas akax utjkiti.
So far it has done very little.	Jichhakamax wali juk’akiw ukham lurawayi.
And next year again.	Ukat jutir marax wasitatwa.
I still have only one.	Nayax wali mä sapakiw utjitu.
Do this several times.	Ukjja walja kutiw lurañama.
He called a few days later.	Jupajj mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa jawsäna.
He is in love with her.	Jupajj munasiñampiw jikjjatasi.
Not more than two.	Janiw pä jila.
I understand why I want to do this.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ munta uk sum amuyasta.
But that's how he likes it.	Ukampis ukham jupajj wal gusti.
Instead, it is not	Jan ukasti, janiw .
But still something wasn't clear.	Ukampis wali kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
And that means he did it here.	Ukat ukax jupax akan luratayna sañ muni.
It kind of looks like that.	Ukax mä juk’a ukham uñtatawa.
But that is not really possible.	Ukampis ukajj janiw cheqpachapun lurañjamäkiti.
When he returned home.	Jupajj utar kuttʼjjäna ukhajja.
And he is not as curious as he used to be.	Ukat janiw nayrjamajj yatiñ munkiti.
But here's what's going on.	Ukampis aka cheqan kunanakas utji uk uñjañäni.
What is it that you .	Kunas ukajj jumanakan .
Please tell me how to do it.	Kunjams lurañax uk yatiyapxita.
But at the time, it was.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, ukhamänwa.
What finally ever.	Kunas qhipharux kunapachas.
But he was in a good mood.	Ukampis jupajj wali sumaw jikjjatasïna.
He is one of them.	Jupajj maynïriwa.
That’s absolutely true.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw chiqpachapuni.
It’s really fun and exciting.	Chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa ukat kusiskañawa.
I didn’t want that to happen.	Janiw nayax ukham lurasiñap munkayätti.
You do something new.	Jumax machaq lurañanak lurasma.
That was something I never thought of.	Ukajj janipuniw nayajj amuykayätti.
I don’t want to get into it.	Janiw ukar mantañ munkti.
It is best done while he is asleep.	Jupajj ikiskäna ukhaw ukham lurañajj wali askejja.
I didn’t want to miss it.	Janiw ukanak jaytañ munkayätti.
This thing looks like the first one.	Aka kunas nayrïr uñtatawa.
A guy is a guy.	Mä waynax mä waynawa.
And never at the same time.	Ukat janipuniw uka pachpa tiemponjja.
It took me a long time to get here.	Aka chiqar puriñkamax wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
Here’s what can happen.	Akax kunas pasaspa.
In the real world, this is not the case.	Chiqpach pachanx janiw ukhamäkiti.
One slit in the nose, the other under one eye.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi, maynix mä nayra manqhan.
It doesn’t mean anything really.	Janiw kunas chiqpachapunix sañ munkiti.
But he accepted it.	Ukampis jupajj uk iyaw sänwa.
He just walked away.	Jupax ukhamakiw sarxäna.
But I don't know about that.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa janiw yatkti.
He’s a great force.	Jupax mä jach’a ch’amawa.
So, you know, we've got that our.	Ukhama, jumax yatisktawa, jiwasax uka jiwasan...
He looks small.	Jupax jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
He told me one day.	Jupajj mä uruw sitäna.
He however refuses to use this.	Jupax ukampis janiw aka apnaqañ munkiti.
It wasn’t there in him.	Janiw jupan ukan utjkänti.
Let’s see what you know.	Kuntï yatkta uk uñjañäni.
I’m sure other people though .	Nayax yatxatwa yaqha jaqinakax ukampis .
He doesn’t do bad things though.	Jupax janiw jan walinak lurkiti ukampis.
He didn't know why he felt that way.	Kunatsa ukham jikjjatasïna uk janiw yatkänti.
He was there last night.	Jupax qhipa arumaw ukan jikxatasïna.
You need to do so quickly.	Jankʼakiw ukham lurañama.
I think that’s a good thing for me.	Nayatakix ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
The point is, someone mentioned it.	Uka tuqitxa, mayniw uka tuqit parläna.
No one knew exactly what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkänti.
I’ve been very strong about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali ch’amampiw arsuwayta.
It’s going to be a great night.	Mä jach’a arumaw saraski.
In fact, it looks good.	Chiqansa, wali suma uñtatawa.
I don't have to do it right.	Janiw nayajj sum lurañajj wakiskiti.
He still didn’t know for sure.	Jupax wali jan sum yatïna.
And he appreciated it.	Ukat wali askit uñjäna.
He saw this immediately.	Ukjja jankʼakiw uñjäna.
Because it’s interesting here.	Kunatix aka chiqanx wali askiwa.
This is my first year here.	Akax nayrïr maraw akan jikxatasi.
The question was when.	Uka jisktʼajj kunapachas sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But that doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
It arrives almost immediately.	Niya jankʼakiw purini.
However, this process may take some time.	Ukampis uka lurañatakejj mä qhawqha tiempow munasispa.
But that, there was nothing to do.	Ukampis ukajja, janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
This is hard for me.	Akax nayatakix ch’amawa.
You don’t want to know the details.	Janiw uka tuqit sum yatiñ munktati.
It is happening fast.	Ukajj jankʼakiw pasaski.
He is his own man.	Jupa pachpa jaqiwa.
There will be time for that later.	Ukatakejj qhepat tiempow utjani.
I really want to see him.	Jupar uñjañ wal munta.
He knows exactly where.	Jupajj kawkhansa uk sum yati.
He went alone.	Jupax sapakiw saräna.
There’s nothing there for me.	Nayatakix janiw kunas ukan utjkiti.
I’m trying my best here.	Nayax akanx taqi ch’amampiw ch’amachasiskta.
So he left the word.	Ukatwa uka arunak jaytawayi.
People are a lot weird.	Jaqinakax walja muspharkañawa.
I mean really really good.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali askiwa sañ munta.
It was discovered.	Ukajj jikjjatasïna.
I want to do something better.	Nayax mä juk’amp suma lurañ munta.
I didn’t think he would do that.	Ukham lurañap janiw amuyirïkti.
I know he wants to help me.	Jupajj nayar yanaptʼañ munta uk sum yatta.
But we must do it well.	Ukampis sumwa lurañasa.
A beautiful wine.	Mä suma vino.
There was no reason to do it.	Uk lurañatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
Not this month.	Janiw aka phaxsinx ukhamäkiti.
So he said he would do it again.	Ukatwa wasitat lurä sasaw säna.
He was a cold, mean man.	Jupajj thaya, jan wali jaqënwa.
No, it’s still slow.	Janiwa, wali ch’amawa.
I am eager to see what happens next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk uñjañ wal munta.
He loved them again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupanakar munasïna.
He happened to see you.	Jupaw jumar uñjasajj pasäna.
But we need to do better.	Ukampis jukʼamp sumwa lurañasa.
It’s your opportunity.	Ukax jumanakan oportunidad satawa.
I know where he is.	Nayajj kawkhansa jupajj jikjjatasi uk yattwa.
Well you do too.	Suma jumax ukhamarakiw.
An unnecessarily short week.	Mä jan wakiskir jisk’a semana.
Things are looking good.	Kunanakas wali suma uñtatawa.
He lives a very happy life.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jakasi.
Our available funds will be limited.	Jiwasan utjki uka qullqix juk’akiw utjani.
You know, like, yeah.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukhama, jïsa.
The future looks bright.	Jutïr pachax wali sumaw uñjasi.
This is not the case before.	Ukax janiw nayrax ukhamäkiti.
Another time perhaps.	Yaqha pachax inas.
There’s no time for that.	Janiw ukatakix tiempox utjkiti.
I mean all and sundry.	Nayax taqpach ukat taqpach sañ munta.
It’s still kind of weird.	Ukax wali kasta muspharkañawa.
So much tender meat.	Ukhama walja llamp’u aycha.
In fact, I started early that morning.	Chiqansa, uka alwaw wali alwat qalltawayta.
It will happen and it will happen for sure.	Ukax pasani ukat chiqpachapuniw pasani.
And that happened yesterday.	Ukat ukax qharüruw pasäna.
Don’t leave them anything.	Janiw jupanakar kuns jaytañamäkiti.
Interestingly enough, he did.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa, jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
Everything is still here.	Taqi kunas akanx wali ch’amawa.
He didn't know anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa yatkänti.
Very nice house.	Wali suma uta.
He seemed to mean something.	Jupajj kuns sañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
He asked me the question.	Jupaw jisktʼitäna.
It’s such a rich guy.	Ukhama qamir jaqiwa.
The problem was that I agreed.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj nayajj iyaw sänwa.
I wasn't even that good at it.	Nayajj janiw ukham sum lurañsa yatkayätti.
I've done that before though.	Ukanx nayrax ukham lurawayta ukampis.
I’m so excited about this.	Nayax wali kusisitaw aka tuqitx jikxatastxa.
But in the present day.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja.
He was asleep and wanted nothing.	Jupajj ikiskäna ukat janiw kuns munkänti.
It moved all over the place very quickly.	Ukajj wali jankʼakiw taqe cheqan sarnaqäna.
And I didn’t do that.	Ukat nayax janiw ukham lurkti.
Tonight he decided to do it first.	Jichha arumax jupax nayraqat lurañ amtawayi.
He’s a little guy.	Jupax mä jisk’a jaqiwa.
Very nice, though.	Wali sumawa, ukampis.
It’s exciting about that.	Uka tuqitxa wali kusiskañawa.
I can’t remember his name at the time.	Uka pachanx janiw sutip amtaskti.
He spoke to her quietly, but firmly.	Jupajj amukiw jupamp parläna, ukampis chʼamampiw parläna.
Of course he isn’t.	Chiqansa janiw jupax ukhamäkiti.
But another time.	Ukampis yaqha kuti.
But he looked serious.	Ukampis jupajj wali amuyumpiw uñnaqäna.
He knows everything about you.	Jupaw jumanakat taqe kun yati.
Almost too good.	Niya sinti suma.
I do no more or less than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan ukajj jukʼamp lurkti.

He’s the only one who can do anything with her.	Jupa sapakiw jupamp kuns luraspa.
I don’t, of course.	Nayax janiw ukham lurkti, chiqpachansa.
He needs a good time.	Jupax mä suma pacharuw munasi.
A little bit every day.	Mä juk’a sapa uru.
There was nothing to back it up.	Ukar yanaptʼañatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.
This is obviously necessary.	Ukajj qhanaw wakisi.
Which he says he refused to do.	Ukxa jupax janiw lurañ munkänti sasaw saraki.
It was almost like a villain.	Niya mä jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
But it’s not what you think it is.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkiti.
That was the real problem here.	Ukaw aka cheqan cheqpach jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
He pulled one out and watched.	Mä apsüna ukat uñchʼukiskäna.
I don’t have sleep deprivation.	Nayax janiw ikiñan jan sum uñjkti.
That would be very useful for us.	Ukajj jiwasatak wali askïspawa.

It's so beautiful, so beautiful.	Ukajj wali sumawa, wali sumawa.
I don't see how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk uñjkti.
But they don’t know yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax yatipkiti.
He didn't make a very good argument.	Jupajj janiw mä wali suma arsuñ arskänti.
I plan to take it this year.	Jichha marax uka apsuñ amtasta.
I think that’s kind of beautiful.	Nayax amuyta ukax mä kasta sumawa.

It feels better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumaw jikjjatasi.
Do it now .	Jichhax uk luram .
I want to treat everyone equally.	Taqiniruw mä chiqapar uñjañ munta.
He wasn't like that before.	Jupajj janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
But he loves it so much.	Ukampis jupajj walpun munasi.
And both of these .	Ukat uka pä tuqitxa .
This was a real morning.	Akax mä chiqpach alwaw utjäna.
I want to live somewhere else.	Nayax yaqha chiqan jakañ munta.
Much later, he started again.	Walja tiempo qhepatjja, wasitatwa qalltäna.
He took good care of it.	Jupajj sum uñjäna.
So yeah, pretty stupid.	Ukhamajj jïsa, wali loqhe.
There is no reason now.	Jichhajj janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
He himself cannot admit it.	Jupa pachpajj janiw uk iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He never had the .	Jupajj janipuniw uka .
I would buy again from here.	Nayax wasitat aka chiqat alañ munta.
And this guy.	Ukat aka waynax.

I don't know exactly what happened.	Nayajj janiw kunas paskäna uk sum yatkti.
I didn't really know.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun yatkayätti.
After that, he worked alone.	Uka qhepatjja, sapakiw irnaqäna.
That doesn't matter to you.	Ukajj janiw jumatak wakiskiti.
And he did, yes.	Ukat jupax uk luratayna, jïsa.
He died less than a week later .	Jupajj janïr mä semana qhepatwa jiwjjäna .
Let’s see what happens this year.	Jichha marax kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
I can’t find him at all.	Nayax janiw juparux kunjamatsa jikxatkti.
Thirty years ago.	Kimsa tunka mara nayra.
I think, actually.	Nayax amuyta, chiqpachansa.
Small, small heart.	Jisk’a, chuyma jisk’a.
I mean really hot.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw junt’u sañ munta.
But that really doesn’t matter.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukax janiw kunäkisa.
That’s definitely the longest so far as well.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw juk’amp jaya pachax jichhakamax ukhamaraki.
It doesn't take much effort.	Janiw sinti chʼam munaskiti.
Don't rush through this.	Janiw aka tuqitx jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
He never wanted it anyway.	Jupajj janipuniw kunjamatsa uk munkänti.
More important than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
But that was never a problem.	Ukampis ukajj janipuniw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Now it’s time to get to work.	Jichhax irnaqäwir mantañ pachaw purini.
Whatever he wants to do is fine.	Kun lurañsa munki ukajj walikïskiwa.
He says he sees nothing now.	Jichhax janiw kuns uñjkti sasaw saraki.
Well, we have a lot of those.	Ukhama, jiwasax walja ukanakaw utjistu.
What does this mean?.	¿Kunsa ukajj sañ muni?.
Do this twice a day.	Uka urux pä kutiw ukham lurañama.
Fool he wasn't.	Loqhe jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to go for it.	Jupajj janiw ukatakejj sarañ munkänti.
It’s all kind of fun.	Taqi kunas mä juk’a kusiskañawa.
It could have been disastrous.	Ukajj jan walinak luraspänwa.
She really loved him.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasïna.

I'm not sure what to do.	janiw nayajj ukhamäkiti.
I think it’s kind of fun.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä juk’a kusiskañawa.
There’s that big hole.	Uka jach’a ch’uqi utji.
Beautiful place, you know, from this distance.	Suma chiqa, jumax yatisktawa, aka jaya chiqat.
You need to do that, too.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi, ukhamaraki.
Or with you.	Jan ukajj jumamp chika.
This could happen more often than you.	Ukajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp kutiw pasaspa.
I’m just here.	Nayax ukhamakiw akanktxa.
But the process takes time.	Ukampis uka lurañatakejj tiempow munasispa.
But it’s not like that.	Ukampis janiw ukham sañjamäkiti.
This was something new.	Akax mä machaq kunaw utjäna.
I decided this was the last beer.	Nayax aka qhipa cerveza ukham amtawayta.
He did it again.	Jupax wasitat luratayna.
I like it almost every time.	Nayatakix niya sapa kutiw wali askïspa.
But nobody liked you.	Ukampis janiw khitis jumar gustkänti.
I’m so happy tonight.	Jichha arumax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
Isn’t that a .	¿Janit ukajj mä .
There were two seasons.	Ukajj pä tiempow utjäna.
That, he said, was unnecessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw jupajj säna.
It didn’t mean anything to me.	Janiw nayatakix kuns sañ munkänti.
Which means they’re still capable of doing it.	Ukax jupanakax wali ch’amampiw uk lurañ yatipxi sañ muni.
I think he’s very bright.	Nayax amuyasta jupax wali qhanawa.
But he seemed to want to do so.	Ukampis ukham lurañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
That time passed later.	Uka tiempojj qhepatwa pasäna.
You should never let it happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurañapatak jaytañamäkiti.
I think it’s a good idea.	Nayax wali suma amuyumpiw amuyta.
I love what you do here.	Kuntï akan lurapkta uk walpun munasta.
But I would say this.	Ukampis nayajj akham sañ munta.
This is another place entirely.	Akax yaqha chiqaw taqpach.
You know what works for you.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas jumatakix askïspa.
But he didn't want that for her.	Ukampis janiw ukanak jupatak munkänti.
And coffee, of course.	Ukat café, chiqpachansa.
I want to know, that’s all.	Nayax yatiñ munta, ukakiw.
He was a man’s man, she thought.	Jupax chachan jaqiwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
It wasn’t the first time.	Janiw nayrïr kutis ukhamäkänti.
He loved her dearly.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw jupar munasïna.
But he is a very nice guy.	Ukampis jupajj wali suma jaqewa.
I don’t find that unusual.	Nayax janiw ukax jan uñt’at jikxatkti.
It took about two years.	Ukatakejj niya pä maraw munasïna.
I didn’t know the time of day.	Uka urux janiw kuna horasas yatkayätti.
The man later died.	Uka chachajj qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
He said it very firmly.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw uk säna.
Or at least why he wanted to do that.	Jan ukajj kunatsa ukham lurañsa munpachäna.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Ukampis, janiw kunäkisa.
This is obviously wrong for you.	Ukajj qhanaw jumatakejj jan walïkiti.
He told her not to do anything.	Jupajj jan kuns luramti sasaw säna.
He is the one who controls them.	Jupaw jupanakar apnaqi.
He immediately saw the effect.	Ukat jankʼakiw kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk uñjäna.
I don’t know where exactly.	Janiw kawkhans cheqpach yatkti.
A new place.	Mä machaq chiqa.
But really, that doesn’t mean anything right now.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax janiw jichhax kuns sañ munkiti.
He started talking about nothing and nothing .	Jupaw jan kuna ukat kuna tuqit parltʼañ qalltäna .
Like he said, he didn't.	Kunjamtï siskäna ukhama, janiw ukham lurkänti.
And they’re a lot of fun.	Ukat jupanakax wali kusiskañawa.

He didn't know what he wanted.	Jupajj janiw kuntï munkäna uk yatkänti.

You’re a great guy.	Jumax jach’a jaqiwa.

Everything was quiet now.	Jichhax taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasïna.
Here, there is nothing.	Akax, janiw kunas utjkiti.
A spacious room.	Mä jach’a cuarto.
But there was something else to do.	Ukampis yaqha lurañaw utjäna.
Did almost nothing.	Niya janiw kuna lurañas lurkänti.
And he didn’t really care.	Ukat jupax janiw chiqpachapunix kuns lurkänti.

She didn't like him, she decided.	Jupajj janiw jupar gustkänti, sasaw amtäna.

There is no one who does that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurir jaqix utjkiti.
But that is almost impossible.	Ukampis ukajj niya chʼamakiwa.
He seems like a nice guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqir uñtatawa.
Very well he refused.	Wali sumwa jupax jan munkänti.
That can certainly happen.	Ukham lurañajj cheqapuniw pasaspa.

So you have to do it in advance.	Ukhamajj nayratpach lurañamawa.
There was no reason to be rude.	Janiw kunatsa jan walinak lurañajj wakiskänti.

He handles it very well.	Jupax wali sumaw ukanak apnaqi.

He had nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañas utjkänti.

I don't think it will last very long.	Janiw sinti jaya tiempox utjkaniti sasaw amuyta.

And now, this.	Ukat jichhax, aka.
Once a week, maybe more, maybe less.	Semanan mä kuti, inas juk’ampi, inas juk’ampi.

See the new rules here.	Machaq kamachinak aka chiqan uñjañäni.
There is no such thing.	Janiw ukham lurañajj utjkiti.
Eventually, he said, he did it wholeheartedly.	Qhepatjja, taqe chuymaw uk lurawayta sasaw jupajj säna.
It all feels strangely right.	Taqi kunas muspharkañ chiqaw sasaw amuyasi.
But he also needs help.	Ukampis jupajj yanaptʼa munaraki.

They’re pretty good actually.	Jupanakax wali sumaw chiqpachansa.
That is certainly the case here.	Ukajj cheqapuniw akan utji.

It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukax wakiskiti.
It’s already pretty impressive.	Ukax niyaw wali muspharkañawa.

It worked for a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw irnaqäna.
And once it happened the other way around.	Ukat mä kutix yaqha tuqitx ukhamarakiw pasäna.
I am glad to see that he is doing so.	Ukham luraski uk uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.

Maybe that’s nothing.	Inas ukax jan kunas utjkaspati.

He took too much.	Jupajj sinti apsüna.
Let me know later if you are able to stay.	Qhipürux yatiyapxita, jumatix qhiparañ yatta ukhaxa.

Always push yourself.	Sapa kutiw juma pachpa chʼamachasiñama.
He is working hard on it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal chʼamachasiski.
I decided to walk.	Nayax sarnaqañ amtawayta.
You know we are .	Jumax yatisktawa jiwasax .
But all of this is still simple.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj wali chʼamakiwa.
But he saw his point.	Ukampis jupajj kuntï siskäna uk sumwa uñjäna.
But that was the best part about it.	Ukampis ukajj uka toqet wali sumapunïnwa.
Better to do something about it, he thought.	Uka tuqit kuns lurañax jukʼamp askiwa, sasaw amuyäna.
I don't want to talk about it.	Janiw nayajj uka toqet parlañ munkti.
But he said nothing more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp kuns siskänti.
He wasn't like he was.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï lurkäna ukhamäkänti.
But he still called her.	Ukampis waliw jupar jawsäna.
He then lived alone and started drinking again.	Ukat sapakiw jakasïna ukat wasitatwa umañ qalltäna.
I seem to be doing that a lot at the moment.	Nayax jichha pachanx walpun ukham luraskta ukhamawa.
But let’s look at the facts.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki uk uñjañäni.
I know how to go about this.	Nayax kunjams aka tuqit sarañ yatta.
I don’t remember myself.	Janiw naya pachpat amtaskti.

I don’t know what time it is.	Janiw kuna horasas yatkti.
This can really be good for you.	Chiqpachansa ukax jumatakix wali askïspawa.
I didn't have that question.	Nayajj janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkitänti.
I didn’t say no to him.	Janiw juparux janiw siskti.
But he says that takes time.	Ukampis ukatakix tiempow munasispa sasaw saraki.
But he felt there was nothing he could do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti sasaw amuyasïna.
But he’s had a really good day.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachapuniw mä suma urux jikxatasïna.
Really, really hot.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali junt’u.
I can’t make this film.	Nayax janiw aka película lurañjamäkiti.
Or a lot of time.	Jan ukajj walja tiempo.
I never thought of anyone like that.	Janipuniw khitirus ukham amuyirïkti.

What is this unnecessary.	Kunas aka jan wakiskir.
There will be a day.	Uka uruw utjani.
What is there for me?.	¿Kunas nayatakix utji?.
But then he refused to do so.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I’ve never seen it all that much before.	Nayax janiw nayrax ukham taqpach uñjkti.
I’ve been here the whole time.	Nayax taqpach pachaw akanktxa.

You are a schoolteacher.	Jumax yatiqañ utan yatichiriwa.

He did everything himself.	Jupajj taqe kunsa jupa pachpaw luräna.
But he couldn't do anything about it.	Ukampis janiw jupajj kuns lurkaspänti.
You made me feel good.	Jumaw nayarojj sum jikjjatasta.
He accepted it immediately.	Ukajj jankʼakiw katoqäna.
I really really really want to use them.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa chiqpachapuniw jupanakar apnaqañ munta.
I find it very unpleasant.	Nayatakix wali jan waliw uñjta.
In fact, that was all there was to it.	Chiqansa, ukax taqi kunaw utjäna.
He doesn’t know what he wants.	Jupax janiw kuntï munki uk yatkiti.
And time passes quickly.	Ukat tiempojj jankʼakiw pasaski.

And he’s still hungry.	Ukat jupax wali manq’at awtjataw jikxatasi.

And he has always done so.	Ukat jupajj nayratpachaw ukham lurawayi.
I really like that one.	Chiqpachansa uka maynix nayatakix wali askiwa.
I didn't think you could do it.	Janiw jumajj uk lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykayätti.

He’s such a nice guy.	Jupax ukham wali suma jaqiwa.

Let’s take a closer look at him.	Jupat sum uñjañäni.

Or how he feels.	Jan ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi ukjja.
It was surprisingly good.	Ukajj muspharkañ sumapunïnwa.
And it’s not like that for me.	Ukat janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.

But maybe .	Ukampis inas .
But it is a good thing to do.	Ukampis uka lurañajj walikïskiwa.
He still didn't say anything though.	Jupax wali jan arskänti ukampis.
You can do bad things.	Jan walinak lurasma.
Now he spoke up.	Jichhajj jupajj arsüna.
I asked him how that could happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa sasaw jupar jisktʼta.
He walked really fast today.	Jichhürojj cheqapuniw jankʼak sarnaqäna.
He has what he wanted.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna ukaw utji.

He said quietly what was next.	Jupajj kunas jutïrin pasani uk amukiw säna.
It will be a very good year.	Wali suma maraw utjani.

But what can you do.	Ukampis kunsa lurasma.
He is a great guy .	Jupax wali jach'a jaqiwa .
In fact, I really enjoyed it.	Chiqansa, chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
But someone left the mix.	Ukampis mayniw uka mistuñ jaytawayi.
But that's not what he did.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jupajj lurkänti.
This happened a couple of times.	Ukax mä pä kutiw pasäna.
He told the police.	Jupax policiaruw yatiyäna.
I really needed to do that.	Chiqpachansa, ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
But that was separate.	Ukampis ukajj sapa mayniw utjäna.

I’m sorry but that’s it.	Nayax llakistwa ukampis ukax ukhamawa.
There are things you want to do on your own.	Kunanaktï juma pachpa lurañ munkta ukanakaw utji.
I promised you something.	Mä kun arsuwayta.
In the morning he did the same.	Alwajj ukhamarakiw luräna.
I didn’t want to give him anything.	Janiw nayax jupar kuns churañ munkayätti.
So awfully long.	Ukhama wali axsarkañ jaya.
He told me a week.	Jupajj mä semanaw sitäna.
I confessed that I did not.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw arsuwayta.
And it shouldn’t do that.	Ukat janiw ukham lurañapäkiti.
Of course, this is a necessity.	Chiqansa, ukax mä wakiskiriwa.
Or so he sees it.	Jan ukajj ukhamarakiw jupajj uñji.
Many, many times.	Walja, walja kuti.
He feels that way.	Jupajj ukham amuyasi.
I want to drink a lot of water throughout the day.	Uka urux walja uma umañ munta.
I asked him about something else.	Nayajj yaqha toqetwa jupar jisktʼta.
There was nothing but.	Janiw kunas utjkänti jan ukasti.

But you have to make the effort.	Ukampis uk lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
And the next day .	Ukat qhipürux .
A hot coin.	Mä junt’u qullqi.
Right now it’s better than nothing.	Jichhax jan kuna lurañat sipansa juk’amp askiwa.
I don’t really see how.	Janiw chiqpachansa kunjamsa uk uñjkti.
Very rarely will it be necessary.	Wali juk’akiw ukax wakisini.

Do what you can, and do it quickly.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk luram, ukat jankʼakiw luram.
This time it was better.	Aka kutix juk’amp sumaw jikxatasïna.
Long and short.	Jaya ukat jisk’a.
It just went on and on.	Ukajj ukhamakiw sarnaqäna.
He was a tall, mature man.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqënwa, jilïr jaqënwa.
But they know when they know.	Ukampis kunapachas yatipxi uk yatipxi.
It’s what he thinks.	Ukax kuntix jupax amuyki ukawa.
I’m not sure what that means, really.	Nayax janiw kuntix ukax sañ munki ukx yatkti, chiqpachansa.
A busy time.	Mä chʼam tukuñ tiempo.
He could have done it with anyone.	Jupajj khitimpis uk luraspänwa.

And I’m not saying that.	Ukat janiw ukham siskti.
I mean somewhere.	Nayax kawkhans sañ munta.
But it was that last day that he cracked up.	Ukampis uka qhep qhepa uruw jupajj chʼalljjtayasïna.
Nothing seemed better than that.	Janiw kunas ukat sipan jukʼamp askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
You’re going to the city.	Jumax markaruw saraskta.
Too many of these are not really good.	Sinti walja ukax janiw chiqpachapunix askïkiti.
And that is exactly what happened to me.	Ukat nayampejj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
But there was no such thing.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
He loves to talk about it.	Jupajj uka toqet parlañ wal muni.
That's what he always said.	Ukhamaw jupajj sapa kuti parläna.
You will be miserable that night.	Uka arumax wali llakitaw jikxatasïta.
And he’s actually a good guy.	Ukat chiqpachansa jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
So it should make a pretty penny.	Ukhamajj mä suma qollqe lurañapawa.
Maybe once, maybe twice.	Inas mä kuti, inas pä kuti lurañax wakischispa.
It doesn’t need to be repeated.	Janiw mayamp mayamp lurañax wakiskiti.
I think it was about that.	Uka toqetwa parläna sasaw amuyta.
He was tall, very thin.	Jupajj jachʼa jaqënwa, wali jiskʼa jaqënwa.
He lived alone in a large house.	Jupajj sapakiw mä jachʼa utan jakasïna.
The last day was a good one.	Qhipa urux wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
It feels like the least you can do.	Ukajj jukʼamp jiskʼa lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
Let’s see what happens between the two.	Kunas uka pä tuqitxa pasani uk uñjañäni.
That’s the way it is in this country.	Ukhamaw aka markanx utji.
He wants money.	Jupax qullqi munaraki.
No one knows better than me.	Janiw khitis nayat sipan jukʼamp sum yatkiti.
But in doing so, he almost died.	Ukampis ukham lurasajj niyaw jiwjjäna.
In one respect it is okay.	Mä tuqitxa walikïskiwa.
The other one isn’t there.	Maynix janiw utjkiti.
All of these are worthwhile.	Taqe ukanakajj wali askiwa.
But I hope not.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suytʼaskta.
And there was some truth to that.	Ukat uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa chiqaw utjäna.
If you want to do a lot, you’ll be happy.	Walja lurañ munsta ukhaxa, kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
So he did it himself.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa luräna.
That was all he wanted.	Ukakiw jupajj munäna.
But it takes a long time.	Ukampis jaya tiempow wakisi.
I think of everything.	Nayax taqi kunat amuyta.
I saw him immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupar uñjta.
In fact, I absolutely agree with that.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa chiqpachapuniw amuyasta.
It was not a problem.	Janiw mä jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
Or me for that matter.	Jan ukax nayax uka tuqitxa.

And the weather is amazing.	Ukat pachax wali muspharkañawa.
Let's see how he appreciates it.	Uka tuqitxa kunjamsa wali askit uñji uk uñjañäni.

And you’re still happy, you’re sad.	Ukat jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatastaxa, llakitaw jikxatastaxa.
So really, someone.	Ukhama chiqpachansa, maynix.
He knew something.	Jupajj kunsa yatïna.
No one really knows how much.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis qhawqha tuqitsa yatkiti.
But he doesn't know exactly.	Ukampis jupajj janiw sum yatkiti.
He barely saw her.	Jupajj jukʼakiw jupar uñjäna.
And it felt very lonely.	Ukat wali sapakiw jikxatasïna.
It refused to let go.	Ukajj janiw jaytañ munkänti.
There is no reason to do so.	Janiw kunatsa ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
You need to build a bedroom.	Mä ikiñ uta lurañaw wakisi.

But there is something better than what is currently available.	Ukampis kunatï jichha tiempon utjki ukanakat sipansa, kunas jukʼamp askiwa.

She wondered again what to do with him.	Ukat kunsa jupamp lurañapa sasaw wasitat jisktʼasïna.
Let's see how he does it.	Kunjamsa jupajj luri uk uñjañäni.
That is the real person.	Ukajj cheqpach jaqewa.
In fact, she looks amazing.	Chiqansa, jupax muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
Everyone would love to do something else.	Taqinipuniw yaqha lurañax wali munasispa.
There's no reason why it can't be done.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti, kunatsa jan ukham lurañjamäki.
He’s important, now.	Jupax wali wakiskiriwa, jichhax.
And they’re separate.	Ukat jupanakax sapa mayniw.
But he threw it at me.	Ukampis jupajj nayaruw jaqontäna.

But that made me love him even more.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj jukʼampiw jupar munasïna.
That's how he ended up.	Ukhamaw jupajj tukuyäna.

Yes, it really was that good.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa ukham sumapunïnwa.
He didn’t know what he was going to do there, really.	Jupax janiw kuns ukan lurani ukx yatkänti, chiqpachansa.

He disagreed with her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp iyaw siskänti.

Seriously something, really.	Sinti kunas, chiqpachansa.
Very nice if you want to walk around the city.	Wali sumawa, jumatix markan sarnaqañ munsta ukhaxa.

I think someone thought it would be good for me.	Nayax amuyta, maynix nayatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyäna.

There is no money here.	Aka chiqanx janiw qullqix utjkiti.
So I didn't understand that.	Ukhamajj janiw uk amuykayätti.

Yeah, that’s exactly what he got.	Jïsa, ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax jikxatasïna.
And he doesn’t know any of that.	Ukat jupax janiw kunas ukanak yatkiti.
He drove for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow autot saräna.

The last little moment is hard.	Qhipa jisk’a pachax ch’amawa.
But that’s not the case, financially.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, qullqi tuqitxa.
I was even more nervous.	Nayajj jukʼampiw ajjsarayäta.
No one at all.	Janiw khitis kunjamatsa.
He had always refused.	Jupajj nayratpachaw jan munkänti.
It’s pretty obvious they know what you’re doing.	Ukax wali qhanawa jupanakax kuntix jumax luraskta uk yatipxi.

But that will take some time.	Ukampis ukatakejj mä jukʼa tiempow munasini.

They are the right kind of person.	Jupanakax chiqa kasta jaqiwa.

All in all, it was a bad day.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jan wali uruw utjäna.

But I'm not sure how to do it.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk lurañajj uk janiw sum yatkti.
He doesn't know it, but he certainly knows it.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkiti, ukampis cheqapuniw uk yati.
It’s a nice, quiet night.	Mä suma, llamp’u arumaw.
He asked her how she knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatta sasaw jisktʼäna.
He felt very good about her.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupat amuyasïna.

And so it went on.	Ukat ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
It’s not like you can’t do that financially.	Janiw qullqi tuqit jan ukham lurañjamäkiti.

But they are important.	Ukampis jupanakajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But he would not come to her.	Ukampis janiw jupar jutañ munkänti.
He seemed reluctant to tell.	Jupajj janis yatiyañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.

You’re the only one here he works for.	Juma sapakiw akanx jupax irnaqäna.
And now .	Ukat jichhax .
Not like last year.	Janiw nayrïr marax ukhamäkiti.
But it's kind of weird.	Ukampis mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
Another thing is, you don’t need the money.	Yaqha tuqitxa, janiw uka qullqix wakiskiti.
Well done to me.	Suma lurawayta naya.

Everything is so quick and so quick.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw ukat wali jank’akiw.

Every hour, this.	Sapa horaw, akax.
Not exactly better, but better.	Janiw chiqpachapunix askïkiti, jan ukasti juk’amp askiwa.

But I have never seen one here before.	Ukampis janiw nayrajj mä akan uñjkti.
See it here .	Aka chiqan uñjañäni .
He himself did not say so.	Jupa pachpajj janiw ukham siskänti.
He just has to do it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw lurañapa.
That’s how he knew how to do it.	Ukhamaw jupax uk lurañ yatïna.
There is no real reason beyond that.	Ukat sipansa janiw kuna cheqpach razonas utjkiti.

He thought she looked bad.	Jupajj jan wali uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.

He’s an amazing teacher.	Jupax wali muspharkañ yatichiriwa.
I could never do it, you know.	Janipuniw lurirjamäkti, jumax yatisktawa.
He didn't understand that.	Jupajj uk janiw amuykayätti.
But now he was looking at something else.	Ukampis jichhajj yaqha toqetwa uñchʼukiskäna.
It is better in one way.	Mä tuqitxa jukʼamp askiwa.
Which, to me, doesn’t matter.	Ukax, nayatakix janiw kunäkisa.
He saw her as more attractive.	Jupajj jukʼamp suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa uñjäna.
Which means all of these things.	Ukax taqi ukanak sañ muni.
I didn't know how it would look myself.	Naya pachpajj kunjamsa uñjasispa uk janiw yatkayätti.

But no one told him the truth.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupar cheq siskänti.

Not any more, he said.	Janiw juk’ampi, sasaw säna.
And so on and so forth.	Ukat yaqha ukhama.

And he kind of.	Ukat jupax mä kasta.
A better person than you is better.	Jumat sipansa jukʼamp suma jaqejj jukʼamp askiwa.
And don’t forget the space under the bed.	Ukat ikiñ manqhan utjki uka chiqat jan armasimti.
I think that was the point.	Ukaw uka tuqit parläna sasaw amuyta.
It did just a little bit.	Ukajj mä jukʼakiw luräna.
There was something about it.	Kunas kunas utjäna.
It’s good but that’s it.	Wali askiwa ukampis ukakiw.

And he couldn’t keep up with her.	Ukat janiw jupamp chika sarañ puedkänti.

I tend to come out a little weak.	Nayax mä juk’a jan ch’amampiw mistuñ yatta.
One man did not do these things.	Mä jaqejj janiw uka lurañanak lurkänti.
He went a little faster.	Jupajj mä jukʼa jankʼakiw saräna.

Nothing like that can really happen again.	Janiw kunas ukham chiqpachapunix mayamp utjkaspati.

For me, this has always been the best thing about it.	Nayatakix akax nayratpachaw ukax wali askiwa.

It looks awesome!.	¡Ukax wali muspharkañ uñtatawa!.

In fact, he spoke a little earlier.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa nayraw parläna.
But for some reason.	Ukampis kunatsa.
Very early there, too.	Wali nayraw ukanx, ukhamaraki.
He didn't know how he felt about her now.	Jichhajj kunjamsa jupat jikjjatasïna uk janiw yatkänti.

He asked why, but he wasn't sure.	¿Kunatsa sasaw jisktʼäna, ukampis janiw sum yatkänti.
It is beautiful and .	Ukajj wali sumawa ukat .
I doubt he did anything wrong.	Nayax jan wali luratapat pächastwa.

As much as that is necessary.	Kunjamtï ukajj wakiski ukhama.
We like it a lot.	Jiwasajj wal gustitu.
I think you might want to know.	Nayax amuyta inas jumax yatiñ munsta.
That’s ultimately worth it.	Ukax qhipharux wali askiwa.
And he is very happy and eager to help.	Ukat wali kusisitaw ukat yanaptʼañ wal munaraki.
Well, that’s what happened this year.	Ukhama, jichha marax ukhamarakiw pasäna.
There are two facts that don’t matter.	Pä chiqaw utji, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Please, tell me a little bit.	Mä juk’a, mä juk’a yatiyapxita.
He’s a little guy.	Jupax jisk’a jaqiwa.

And he chuckled.	Ukat jupax chuym ch’allxtayäna.
But something did that .	Ukampis kunas ukham luräna .
Or do it immediately.	Jan ukajj jankʼakiw ukanak lurañama.
That definitely doesn’t work.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jan irnaqkiti.
It worked fast a week ago.	Mä semana nayrajj jankʼakiw irnaqäna.
It’s easy, but it takes some time.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, ukampis mä juk’a tiempow munasispa.
I have a car and everything I need.	Nayax mä auto ukat taqi kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utjitu.
So far, it’s pretty cool.	Jichhakamax, wali ch’amawa.
He seemed to be a very sincere man.	Wali taqe chuyma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
You have to do it the first time.	Nayrïr kutin lurañaw wakisi.
For me, it’s one.	Nayatakix mä.

I will not do this to anyone.	Nayajj janiw khitirus ukanak lurkäti.
I’m more cautious.	Nayax juk’amp amuyumpiw sarnaqañ yatta.
Tell me if you know.	Jumax yatisktawa uk yatiyapxita.
No, he wanted the truth.	Janiwa, kunatï cheqäki uk munäna.

There was nothing to eat there.	Janiw kunas ukan manq’añax utjkänti.
But I don't think it's right.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw walïkiti.
It was about money.	Ukajj qollqe toqetwa parläna.
If he did, he did nothing.	Ukham luraspa ukhajja, janiw kuns lurkänti.
They don't know his name.	Jupanakajj janiw sutip yatipkiti.
I put all that aside.	Nayax taqi ukanak mä chiqar jaytawayta.

But no one can really do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpachansa ukham lurkaspati.
I felt amazing all day.	Nayax urunakpachaw muspharkañ jikxatasiyäta.
You don’t want them anyone.	Jumax janiw jupanakar khitis munktati.
These are the things he advised.	Ukanakaw jupajj ewjjtʼäna.
It took three hours.	Ukatakejj kimsa horaw munasïna.
He was very shaken up for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj wal chʼalljjtayasïna.
He says yes to it.	Jupax jïsa sasaw saraki.
There was something he really wanted.	Kunatï jupajj wal munkäna ukajj utjäna.
He gave me a good meal.	Jupaw mä suma manqʼa churitu.

A long, terrible time that no one mentioned.	Mä jaya, jan wali tiempojj janiw khitis arskänti.
No, he didn’t really want to.	Janiwa, janiw cheqpachapun jan munkänti.
So far, it’s clear.	Jichhakamax, qhanaw amuyasi.
He realized this later.	Ukjja qhepatwa amuyasïna.

He walked in silence.	Jupajj amukiw sarnaqäna.

Don't forget this time.	Aka kutix jan armasimti.
There’s nothing I can say for you.	Janiw kunas jumatakix sañjamäkiti.
I never liked you.	Janipuniw nayajj jumar gustkituti.
It should be done clearly.	Qhanaw lurañapa.
Then he finally spoke again.	Ukat qhepatjja, wasitatwa parläna.
You can’t do it again.	Janiw mayampsa lurañjamäkiti.
He’s outside all day, all the time.	Jupax urunakpachaw anqan jikxatasi, taqi pachaw jikxatasi.
He said something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kuns säna.
He uttered a sigh of relief.	Jupax mä jach’a jach’a jach’a tukuñ arsüna.
He wondered how long he could last.	Qhawqha tiempos uka jaqejj utjaspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
It’s not all money.	Janiw taqpach qullqix utjkiti.
In fact, it looks awesome.	Chiqansa, wali muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
It is not a good thing to do.	Janiw uka lurañajj walïkiti.
It rains well, he says.	Sumaw jallu, sasaw saraki.
I can't think of anything better than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
There is always more to be found.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp jikjjatasi.
I had no choice but to .	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti, jan ukasti .
There really is no such thing.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañax utjkiti.
I don’t know what to do for him.	Janiw kunsa jupatak lurañ yatkti.
Back then, that was something else.	Uka tiemponjja, ukajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
But there’s a chance to get there.	Ukampis uka chiqar puriñkamax ch’amaw utji.
I think it’s wrong.	Nayax jan waliw sasaw amuyasta.
But what for me what.	Ukampis kunas nayatakix kunas.
It felt like morning was coming soon.	Niyaw alwajj purini sasaw amuyasïna.
I don’t want to see everything.	Janiw taqi kun uñjañ munkti.
There’s a place there, of course.	Ukanx mä chiqaw utji, chiqpachansa.
He received her without love.	Jupajj jan munasiñampiw jupar katoqäna.
Not in the morning .	Janiw alwajj ukhamäkiti .
It’s how you do it.	Kunjamsa jumax lurasma ukawa.
You know we will.	Jumax yatisktawa jiwasax uk lurañäni.
That was a good time for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj mä suma pachaw utjäna.
Somehow that didn't surprise me.	Kunjamatsa ukajj janiw muspharkayätti.
When you as you do.	Kunapachatï jumax kunjamtï lurapkta ukhama.
I feel like everything is possible.	Taqi kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
He said how he wanted to use it.	Kunjamsa ukanak apnaqañ munta sasaw säna.
If you do, you’ll enjoy eating.	Ukham lurasax manq’añax wali askiwa.
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.	Taqi chuymaw jupanakar yuspärta.
This is unbearable.	Ukajj janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
He’s the most popular.	Jupax juk’amp uñt’atawa.
I started taking care of him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjañ qalltawayta.
He knew all about it.	Jupajj uka toqet taqe kunwa yatïna.
That means it’s quick.	Ukax jank’akiw sañ muni.
Now that one is obvious to me.	Jichhax uka maynix nayatakix qhanaw uñjasi.
She is truly an amazing woman.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali muspharkañ warmiwa.
Of course, that is not the case today.	Chiqansa, jichhürunakanxa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He just feels different.	Jupajj yaqha ukhamakiw jikjjatasi.
Eventually, he has to.	Qhepatjja, jupajj lurañapawa.
He knew nothing about me.	Jupajj janiw nayat kuns yatkänti.
Nothing meant anything.	Janiw kunas kuns sañ munkänti.
So he stayed at home.	Ukatwa utan qheparäna.
There isn’t that time yet.	Janiw uka pachax utjkiti.
It’s a pretty great day.	Mä suma jach’a uru.
You may want to use a few things immediately.	Inas mä qhawqha yänak jankʼak apnaqañ munsta.
In fact, he admits that this is not the case.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw arsuwayi.
It’s done a terrible thing.	Wali axsarkañ lurawayi.
He actually started talking again.	Chiqpachansa wasitat arsuñ qalltäna.
In fact, I like to do that.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It seemed very old.	Ukajj wali chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
That’s exactly what happens.	Ukaw chiqpachapunix utji.
Like he didn't know what to do.	Kunjamtï jupajj kun lurañsa jan yatkänti.
He didn't quite understand why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum amuykänti.
I’m really, really, really worried about donating money.	Nayax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa qullqi churañ tuqitxa llakistwa.
That’s that’s all good.	Ukax ukax taqpach sumaw.
You never have to eat.	Janipuniw manq’añax wakiskiti.
And we have plenty of that.	Ukat jiwasax ukax walpun utjistu.
He died together for the first time.	Jupajj nayrïr kutiw mayachtʼasis jiwjjäna.
I want to spend some time.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw sarnaqañ munta.
I didn’t go on a book deal.	Nayax janiw mä libronak lurañ amtar sarkti.
He pulled hard, but that was it.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw jaqontäna, ukampis ukhamänwa.
I don’t think he understood.	Nayax janiw jupax amuyaskänti.
He moves every few years.	Jupax sapa mä qawqha maranakaw yaqha chiqar sarxi.
The man spoke about twice a week.	Uka jaqejj semanan niya pä kutiw parläna.
It also wants to stay small.	Ukhamarakiw jisk’a qhiparañ munaraki.
I look forward to learning more in the future.	Nayax jutïrin juk’amp yatxatañ suyt’askta.
It’s almost too big.	Niya wali jach’a uñtatawa.
He’s a really bad guy.	Chiqpachansa jan wali jaqiwa.
Your significant other.	Juman wali wakiskir yaqha.
But that is the point.	Ukampis ukajj uka toqet wali wakiskiriwa.
He came again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jutäna.
Try to avoid that.	Ukham jan lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
What happened the other night.	Kunas yaqha arumax pasäna.
And that’s all there was to it.	Ukat ukakiw ukax utjäna.
He decides to do the first one.	Jupax nayrïr lurañ amti.
You are an awesome and wonderful woman.	Jumax wali muspharkañ ukat muspharkañ warmiwa.
I never imagined the whole mess.	Janipuniw uka taqpach jan waltʼäwejj amuyirïkti.
He came with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw jutäna.
But there can be more to him.	Ukampis jukʼampiw jupajj utjaspa.
He wanted to stay in the house.	Uka utan qhiparañ munäna.
I never liked it at all.	Janipuniw kunjamatsa gustkituti.
So he bought it for me.	Ukatwa jupajj nayatak alasïna.
But there was nothing beyond that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa janiw kunas utjkänti.
The truth gets here.	Chiqaw aka chiqar puri.
Also, how long it will take.	Ukhamaraki, qawqha pachas ukax munasini.
He just likes it that way.	Jupajj ukhamakiw gusti.
Now we have to do that again.	Jichhax wasitat ukham lurañaw wakisi.
The problem was obvious.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I feel all that energy.	Taqi uka ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.
He or she said it many times.	Jupajj jan ukajj jupajj walja kutiw ukham säna.
And he told her everything.	Ukat taqi kunwa jupar yatiyäna.

He’s kind of old school like that.	Jupax mä juk’a nayra yatiqañ utan ukhama.
You have to do the right thing.	Jumajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañamawa.
I don't know who to help first.	Janiw khitirus nayraqat yanaptʼañ yatkti.
Well, until now, no one had done it.	Ukhama, jichhakamax janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
Everyone knows where this man is.	Aka jaqix kawkhans jikxatasi uk taqiniw yatipxi.
But, somehow, he wondered.	Ukampis, kunjamatsa, sasaw jisktʼasïna.
So they were like that.	Ukhamajj jupanakajj ukhamänwa.
I asked what I saw.	Kuntï uñjkta uk jisktʼta.
Or maybe I should.	Jan ukajj inas nayajj wakischispa.

You, here with me.	Jumax, akan nayamp chika.
I’m feeling very strong at the moment.	Nayax jichha pachanx wali ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.
He’s a summer man.	Jupax mä verano jaqiwa.

It’s what it says.	Kuntï siski ukawa.
If he wanted to do that, that's fine.	Ukham lurañ munäna ukhajja, walikïskiwa.
Because, it’s worth it.	Kunatix, ukax wali askiwa.

Just like he does.	Kunjamtï jupajj luraski ukhama.

Finally, he fell asleep.	Qhepatjja, ikiñar jaqontäna.
But no one really needs to.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw khitis ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
It seemed to make a comfortable bed.	Ukajj mä suma ikiñ lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
But two years later he made his own decision.	Ukampis pä mara qhepatjja, jupa pachpaw amtäna.
In this case we .	Uka tuqitxa jiwasax .
It’s amazing and beautiful.	Ukax muspharkañawa ukat wali sumawa.
He couldn't stay out of it.	Jupajj janiw ukat qheparañ puedkänti.
He has done so much for me.	Jupajj walpun nayatak lurawayi.
Whatever you do, don’t do that.	Kun lurañsa, jan ukham luramti.

Whatever though, of course.	Kunas ukampis, chiqpachansa.
It’s amazing for you.	Jumatakix wali muspharkañawa.

There was all silence.	Ukanx taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasïna.
And, yeah, that’s pretty much how we like it.	Ukat, jïsa, niya ukhamarakiw jiwasax gustitu.
So far so good, really good.	Jichhakamax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
This is an important necessity.	Ukajj mä wakiskir wakiskiriwa.
He couldn't tell anyone.	Jupajj janiw khitirus yatiyañ puedkänti.
He barely felt anything.	Jupajj jukʼakiw kuns jikjjatasïna.
It was either him or nothing.	Jupaw jan ukajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
Anyway, it still doesn't work.	Kawkhansa, wali jan irnaqkiti.
He decided to do something on his own.	Jupa pachpaw kuns lurañ amtäna.
Also, it’s a nice sight.	Ukhamaraki, wali sumawa.
I’m sure you can do better than that.	Nayax yatxatwa jumax ukat sipan juk’amp sum lurasma.

He didn't know what we were doing.	Jupajj janiw kuntï lurapkta uk yatkänti.
And he said, of course.	Ukat jupax sänwa, chiqpachansa.
But now he could do nothing.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuns lurañ puedkänti.

Which way, he doesn't know.	Kawkïr tuqitsa, janiw yatkiti.
Not a bad beer by any means.	Janiw mä jan wali cerveza kuna tuqitsa.

You need some alone time.	Mä jukʼa tiempo sapakiw munasi.
Cold is hot, hot is cold.	Thaya ukaxa junt’u, junt’u ukaxa thaya.
That’s what eventually happened.	Ukhamaw qhipharux pasäna.

He turned cautiously.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw kuttʼjjäna.
Maybe you’ll feel better in the main room anyway.	Inas jumax kunjamatsa jach’a cuarto ukanx juk’amp sum jikxatasïta.
I disagree with you.	Nayajj janiw jumamp iyaw siskti.
But not all of this was the case.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanakajj ukhamäkänti.

In the case of you.	Uka tuqitxa jumax.

He loved the place.	Jupajj uka cheqar walpun munäna.
But the process went quickly.	Ukampis uka lurañajj jankʼakiw saräna.
But he made a very important point.	Ukampis mä wali wakiskir arunak arsüna.
But it started almost immediately.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw qalltäna.
Now I see it differently.	Jichhax yaqha tuqit uñjta.
The ride is much better.	Uka autot sarañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
And he doesn’t like it, not at all.	Ukat janiw juparux gustkiti, janiw kunjamatsa gustkiti.
I have always been able to do this.	Nayajj nayratpachaw uk lurañ yatta.
The reason for this is obvious.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
Everything seemed impossible.	Taqe kunas jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
There was nothing like it.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
I feel thankful to him.	Jupar yuspärta sasaw amuyasta.

He knew it all at once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw taqe ukanak yatïna.

It’s time for both of us to leave.	Panpachaniw sarxañ pachaw purini.
I never thought this would happen now.	Jichhajj ukham pasani uk janipuniw amuykayätti.

So with him.	Ukhamajj jupamp chika.
And that wasn’t somewhere with nobody.	Ukat ukax janiw kawkhans jan khitimpis utjkänti.

And then it can happen.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
And it took some time.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempow munasïna.
You have to be really innovative.	Chiqpachansa machaq lurañanak lurañamawa.
Finally, he asked her what she had decided.	Qhepatjja, kuntï amtkäna uk jisktʼäna.
He did things exactly as you said.	Jupajj kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukhamwa kuns luräna.

He started going there every day.	Jupajj sapa uruw ukar sarañ qalltäna.

Ultimately, he couldn't do it.	Qhepatjja, janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I’ve done this twice.	Nayax pä kutiw ukham lurawayta.

And he didn’t do that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukham lurkänti.

It’s still cruel to me.	Nayatakix wali qhuru.

You know, he’s fine.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax walikïskiwa.
That’s when he started to do bad things.	Ukhaw jan walinak lurañ qalltäna.

There are no villains here.	Aka chiqanx janiw jan wali jaqinakax utjkiti.
But he meant something.	Ukampis kun sañ munäna.
He did not say anything at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kuns arskänti.
They don’t know how to be honest.	Janiw chiqapar sarnaqañ yatipkiti.
This is what surprises me.	Akax nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.

I want to know everything about you.	Nayax jumanakat taqi kun yatiñ munta.

That’s it, after all.	Ukax ukhamawa, taqi kunat sipansa.
There’s definitely something to that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa kunas utji.

Why, or why not.	Kunatsa, jan ukax kunatsa.

And then there will be more and more.	Ukat ukat qhepatjja, jukʼamp jukʼampiw utjani.
But, really, it is.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
I don't think it's a problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati sasaw amuyta.
And it is, of course, what he was supposed to do.	Ukat chiqpachansa, kuntï lurañapäkäna ukawa.
Don’t do it too many times.	Janiw walja kuti lurañamäkiti.
I know nothing about wine.	Nayajj janiw vino toqet kuns yatkti.

I'm better than that.	Nayax ukat sipan juk'amp askiwa.

It’s really a surprise.	Chiqpachansa mä muspharkañawa.
So it wasn't everywhere.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe cheqan utjkänti.
He knows what the future holds.	Kunas jutïrin utjani uk yati.
In the past, this was not the case.	Nayra tiemponjja janiw ukhamäkänti.

This one he thought would be harder.	Akax juk’amp ch’amaw sasaw amuyäna.

I really don’t, you know.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkti, jumax yatisktawa.
I wonder if he knows.	Jupajj uk yatpachati sasaw jisktʼasta.
It’s a very good chance.	Ukax wali suma ch’amawa.
Leave it to me.	Uk jaytawayta.
Of course we are not.	Chiqansa janiw jiwasax ukhamäkiti.
I was kind of very surprised.	Nayajj mä jukʼa wal muspharta.
It was silent.	Ukajj amukiw utjäna.
I don't know how that's going to happen.	Janiw kunjamsa ukajj pasani uk yatkti.
He’s definitely going for it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukatakix saraski.
Isn’t that right.	¿Janit ukhamäki.
He knew it all along, he recalled.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yatïna, sasaw amtäna.
I’m going to be very strong.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw saraskta.
I had no time for that.	Ukatakejj janiw kuna tiempos utjkitänti.
I’m very grateful for that, actually.	Nayax uka tuqitx walpun yuspärta, chiqpachansa.
Yours isn’t the case.	Juman janiw ukhamäkiti.
Better to go now.	Jichhax sarañax juk’amp askiwa.
But he didn't want to see her.	Ukampis janiw jupar uñjañ munkänti.
No, he didn't understand.	Janiwa, janiw amuyaskänti.
I really feel that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham jikxatastxa.
It only worked once.	Mä kutikiw irnaqäna.
That’s what everyone knows.	Ukham taqiniw yatipxi.
And last but probably.	Ukat qhipa ukampis inas.
So it can't be everything.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe kunas utjkaspati.
Maybe you can do that once.	Inas mä kuti ukham lurasma.
You obviously understand.	Jumax qhanaw amuyasta.
He would have done it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk luraspänwa.
I had no idea what I was really expecting.	Kuntï cheqpachapun suykayäta uk janiw amuykayätti.
I’ve always wanted to go there.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukar sarañ munta.
But he said nothing about it to anyone.	Ukampis janiw khitirus uka toqet kuns siskänti.
He needs them all the time.	Jupajj jupanakajj sapa kutiw munasi.
And it felt that way to me.	Ukat nayatakix ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
Until now, he didn’t want to do that.	Jichhakamax janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
But all of that makes sense to me.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
I like this person.	Nayax aka jaqix wali askiwa.
He never knew real life.	Jupajj janipuniw cheqpach jakañ yatkänti.
The new world needs a different kind of person.	Machaq pachax yaqha kasta jaqiruw munasi.
That’s the last thing you need to do.	Ukaw qhip qhipa lurañax wakisi.
It barely worked.	Ukajj jukʼakiw irnaqäna.
I just love him like that.	Nayax juparux ukhamakiw munasta.
I didn’t go to see it.	Janiw uñjir sarkti.
It was really nice how it came.	Chiqpachansa kunjams jutäna ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
He wasn't sure it had been that way before.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa sasaw jupajj jan sum yatkänti.
He didn't understand her feelings.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï jikjjatasi uk sum amuykänti.
Now, too much else.	Jichhax, sinti yaqha tuqitxa.
Do as he says.	Kunjamtï siskäna ukham luram.
He looked quiet.	Jupax amukiw uñnaqäna.
He didn't mean that at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa ukham sañ munkänti.
It doesn’t matter to make a good film.	Mä película sum lurañatakix janiw kunas wakiskiti.
He really wanted to talk to you.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw jumamp parltʼañ munäna.
It was a wonderful night.	Mä suma arumaw utjäna.
I wonder how long that will last.	Ukajj qhawqha tiempos utjani sasaw jisktʼasta.
This is interesting here.	Akax akanx wali askiwa.
We’ll do it alone this time.	Jiwasax aka kutix sapakiw lurañäni.
How to tell them what you do.	Kunjamsa kuntï lurkta uk jupanakar yatiyañama.
But it really didn’t matter.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukax wakiskänti.
Or something inside us.	Jan ukajj kunas jiwasan manqhan utji.
He was already in town.	Jupajj niyaw markar sarjjäna.
And it doesn’t work that way.	Ukat janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
These can be found here.	Ukanakax aka chiqan jikxatasi.

He was so happy to see you.	Jupajj jumar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He enjoyed it, he said.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna, sasaw säna.
It happened to be a good one.	Ukajj wali sumwa pasäna.
He’s had a great year.	Jupax mä jach’a maraw jikxatasïna.
He had no choice, now he knew.	Jupax janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, jichhax uk yatïna.
That wasn't there.	Ukajj janiw ukan utjkänti.
The money is still worth it.	Qullqix wali askiwa.
Everything is fun.	Taqi kunas kusiskañawa.
I didn’t think anyone would do that.	Janiw khitis ukham lurañap amuykayätti.
It was really quick.	Chiqpachansa jankʼakiw utjäna.
He never knew that well.	Jupajj janipuniw ukham sum yatkänti.
Or from me, either.	Jan ukax nayat, jan ukax.
The first one came after me.	Nayrïr jupaw nayar qhepat jutäna.
Someone do something about it.	Maynix uka tuqit kuns luraspa.
Let’s see how useful each one can be.	Kunjamsa sapa maynix wali askïspa uk uñjañäni.
He promised to do anything for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj kunsa lurä sasaw arsüna.
It’s quick, efficient and convenient.	Ukax jank’akiw, wali suma ukat wali askiwa.
It has happened before, many times.	Nayrajj ukhamänwa, walja kutiw pasäna.
He didn't want to do it himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj uk lurañ munkänti.
Yours, and so on.	Juman, ukat ukham.
That seems like a good idea.	Ukax wali askïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasi.
You will have nothing to do.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas utjkaniti.
There is definitely some space.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa chiqaw utji.
Definitely something new.	Chiqpachansa, kuna machaq lurañas wakisispa.
He has to do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw lurañapa.
But she’s a wonderful woman.	Ukampis jupax wali suma warmiwa.
But this morning .	Ukampis jichha alwajj .
There is no reason for what he did.	Kuntï lurkäna ukajj janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
This is what every country should do.	Ukax sapa markan lurañapawa.
I want the power.	Nayax ch’am munta.
I love him, he’s a great guy.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta, jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
The next two things happened.	Jutïr pachanx pä kunas pasäna.
That was all they had.	Ukakiw jupanakajj utjäna.
It never matters, it doesn’t matter.	Janipuniw kunäkisa, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
You really should do that.	Chiqpachansa ukham lurañamawa.
So I didn't know that much about him.	Ukhamajj janiw jupat ukham sum yatkayätti.
I never thought of anything.	Janipuniw kuns amuyirïkti.
I wasn't saying there was nothing wrong with it.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati sañ munkayätti.
Almost every night now, actually.	Jichhax niya sapa arumaw, chiqpachansa.
Why, he never did.	Kunatsa, janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
You know how it is.	Jumax kunjamsa uk yatisktawa.
I expected him to do that.	Nayajj ukham lurañapatakiw suykayäta.
He sped off in the car.	Jupajj autot jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
He turned around saying.	Jupajj akham sasaw kuttʼjjäna.
I’ll be the only one.	Naya sapakiw jikxatasïta.
I only plan to go out once or twice.	Mä jan ukajj pä kutikiw mistuñ amtasta.
But that takes a lot of time.	Ukampis ukatakix walja tiempow munasispa.
He didn't want to control you.	Jupajj janiw jumar apnaqañ munkänti.
Make them very happy.	Jupanakar wali kusisitaw luram.
What happens next, no one knows.	Kunas jutïrin pasani, janiw khitis yatkiti.
So good but so, so ugly.	Ukhama suma ukampis ukhama, ukhama jan wali.
But that's what he does.	Ukampis ukhamwa jupajj luri.
Anything more, he didn’t know.	Juk’ampi kunas, jupax janiw yatkänti.
He doesn't like you right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj jumar munaskiti.
I saw it myself recently.	Naya pachpaw jichhak uñjta.
Earlier in the day would have been better.	Nayra urux wali askïspawa.
He never said this.	Jupajj janipuniw akham siskänti.
It really and truly is me.	Chiqpachansa ukat chiqpachapuniw nayax.
That one was robbed.	Uka mayniw lunthatasïna.
He wanted a little bit.	Jupajj mä jukʼa munäna.
He is doing a good job of it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali sumwa luraski.
The man did the same thing.	Uka jaqejj ukhamarakiw luräna.
Not much of a day, really.	Janiw mä urux sinti, chiqpachansa.
What he did was obvious.	Kuntï lurkäna ukajja, qhanaw amuyasïna.
Why why why.	Kunatsa kunatsa kunatsa.
I don't want to help anyone.	Janiw khitirus yanaptʼañ munkti.
I was so happy to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj walpun kusista.
You know .	Yattati .
It’s not just one or two.	Janiw mä jan ukax pä sapakix utjkiti.
It feels lonely here.	Aka chiqanx sapakiw jikxatasi.
Many times more.	Walja kutiw juk’ampi.
That doesn’t go well.	Ukax janiw sum sarkiti.
That’s all we have to do here.	Aka chiqanx ukakiw lurañasa.
It promises to rain again one morning.	Mä alwax wasitat jallu purini sasaw arsuwayi.
But tonight he did.	Ukampis jichha arumaw ukham luräna.
Nothing he wanted to see here.	Janiw kunas akan uñjañ munkänti.
That’s what happened to them.	Ukaw jupanakar pasäna.
A very special day.	Mä wali wakiskir uru.
You have to work hard every day.	Sapa uruw taqe chuyma chʼamachasiñama.
He didn't care if that was right or not.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw jupajj kuns lurkänti.
I promised it would be no problem.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw arsuwayta.
He felt it was bigger.	Jupax juk’amp jach’a ukham jikxatasïna.
And so he must.	Ukat ukhamarakiw jupajj lurañapa.
But there is clarity.	Ukampis qhanaw utji.
But it seems more and more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw ukham amuyasi.
But it is better to do so.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa.
You’re always in school and that’s it.	Jumax sapa kutiw yatiqañ utan jikxatastaxa ukat ukax.
He told me to do it.	Uk luram sasaw sitäna.
He was both excited and sad.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna ukat wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
So he was asleep.	Ukatwa jupajj ikiskäna.
I plan to use it.	Nayax uka apnaqañ amtasta.
It was a very enjoyable night.	Uka arumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Honestly, he expected more than that.	Chiqpachansa, ukat sipansa jukʼampiw suyäna.
And the day came.	Ukat uka uruw purinïna.
Now this is when.	Jichhax akax kunapachas.
He wondered how he could do it.	Kunjamsa uk luraspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He told me he had the job.	Jupaw uka lurañajj utji sasaw sitäna.
Or wherever it is located.	Jan ukajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi.
That happened between you and me.	Ukajj nayamp jumamp chikaw pasäna.
He didn't think you did.	Jupajj janiw jumajj ukham amuyaskänti.
Until the little bit.	Jisk’a jisk’a jisk’a.
He was obviously passionate about it.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun munasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Let's see what he thinks.	Kunsa jupajj amuyi uk uñjañäni.
It’s definitely not you.	Chiqpachansa janiw jumax ukhamäkiti.
And she loves and wants him.	Ukat juparux walpun munasi ukat munaraki.

There’s good for you there.	Ukanx jumatakix wali askiwa.
In this case, it’s still .	Uka tuqitxa, wali .
That’s what happened this time.	Ukhamaw aka kutix pasäna.
Honestly, it hasn’t been that long.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukham jaya tiempox utjkiti.
And he told her.	Ukat jupajj jupar yatiyäna.
Too quiet, actually.	Sinti amukiw, chiqpachansa.
One night he wanted to give it his all.	Mä arumaw taqe kun churañ munäna.
I wanted to talk to you earlier.	Nayax nayrax jumamp parlañ munta.
We have something.	Jiwasax kunas utjistu.
No one seemed to know exactly what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janis khitis sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He was the one who was watching.	Jupaw uñchʼukiskäna.
He didn't want to see that happen.	Jupajj janiw ukham pasañap uñjañ munkänti.
He worked the night before, yes.	Jupax nayrïr arumaw irnaqäna, jïsa.
Two snowflakes, snowflakes, snowflakes.	Pä ch’uqi, ch’uqi, ch’uqi.
The beautiful place.	Uka suma chiqa.

He doesn’t know too much about it.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit sinti sum yatkiti.
And that just happened.	Ukat ukajj jichhakiw pasäna.
I’m always worried.	Nayax sapa kutiw llakista.

He’s doing a wonderful job.	Jupax wali suma irnaqäw luraski.
Nothing to do, he said.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, sasaw jupajj säna.
I mean the real worst.	Chiqpach juk’amp jan waliw sañ munta.
But they don't know how to do that.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa ukham lurañajj wakisispa uk yatipkiti.
Well yes, and no.	Suma jïsa, ukat janiw.
I want to know what that feels like.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk yatiñwa munta.
It’s so weird, he’s so good all over the place.	Ukhama muspharkañawa, jupax wali sumaw taqi chiqan jikxatasi.
Why do you ask the question.	Kunatsa jumajj jisktʼasta.
That’s what’s there.	Ukaw ukan utji.
He wants me to take him out.	Jupax nayan jupar apsuñ muni.
He thanked me politely.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw yuspärta.
But he happened late.	Ukampis jupajj qhepatwa pasäna.
I thought that was really, really cool.	Ukax chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Tomorrow is the big day.	Qhipürux jach'a uruw purini.
We need money immediately.	Jiwasax jank’akiw qullqix munasispa.
He’s always been honest with me.	Jupax nayratpachaw nayamp chika chiqapar sarnaqäna.
He wanted to do something big, something big and new.	Jupax mä jach’a lurañ munäna, mä jach’a ukat machaq lurañanak lurañ munäna.
He was doing it vigorously.	Jupajj uk chʼamampiw luraskäna.
Now let's see what happened.	Jichhajj kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
It’s not that it’s not.	Janiw jan ukhamäkiti.
We need to do this properly.	Uk sumwa lurañasa.
That was no, it wasn't.	Ukajj janiw, janiw ukhamäkänti.
But beyond that, people don't know.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, jaqenakajj janiw yatipkiti.
I want more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munta.
That’s all you need to do.	Ukakiw lurañax wakisi.
That is not in your interest.	Ukham lurañajj janiw jumatak askïkiti.
I never thought he could do it.	Janipuniw jupajj uk luraspawa sasin amuyirïkti.
He worked hard on it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal chʼamachasïna.
He’s a very real person.	Jupax wali chiqpach jaqiwa.
That’s all there is to it.	Ukakiw taqi kunas utji.
He left through the back door.	Jupajj qhepa punku toqetwa sarjjäna.
But again he got there before me.	Ukampis wasitatwa nayat nayrajj uka cheqar purinïna.
Instead, yes.	Jan ukasti jïsa.
But, this other person was.	Ukampis, aka yaqha jaqix ukhamänwa.
Well, it’s just one.	Ukhama, mä sapakiw.
He could do it, so he did it.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, ukatwa uk luräna.
He could have done that, but he couldn't.	Ukham lurasajj uk luraspänwa, ukampis janiw puedkänti.
He got one first.	Jupajj nayraqat mä katoqäna.
But he didn’t want to go there.	Ukampis janiw ukar sarañ munkänti.
That speaks an awful lot.	Ukax mä axsarkañ jach’a arunak arsu.
This house is perfect for you.	Aka utax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That’s what happened to me.	Ukhamaw nayatakix pasäna.
So that's a lot more fun than it could have been.	Ukhamajj ukajj kuntï lurañapäkäna ukat sipansa jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
To be honest, it took a while.	Chiqpachansa, mä jukʼa tiempow munasïna.
I didn’t go to bed.	Nayax janiw ikiñar sarkti.
I started to appreciate them.	Jupanakar wali askit uñjañ qalltawayta.

But that really isn’t enough.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukax askïkiti.
It was the first single.	Ukajj nayrïr sapakiw utjäna.
I’m going every day.	Nayax sapa uruw saraskta.
It’s a very difficult thing,.	Ukax wali ch’amawa,.
He just made it more real.	Jupax ukhamakiw juk’amp chiqpach lurawayi.
Maybe it’s a bad thing.	Inas jan walinak luraspa.
He thought he needed her three times.	Jupax kimsa kutiw munasïna sasaw amuyäna.
But he knew he never would.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham lurkaniti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I almost didn’t see him.	Niya janiw jupar uñjkti.
All kinds of things you can do.	Taqi kasta kunatix jumax lurañjamäki.

In fact, more the other way around.	Chiqansa, jukʼampiw yaqha tuqitxa.

You don’t want it there.	Jumax janiw uka chiqan munktati.

And of course, it probably doesn’t matter.	Ukat chiqansa, inas jan kunäkisa.
But today .	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja .
It is amazing how well that worked.	Ukajj kunjamsa sum irnaqäna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
I said no to that.	Nayajj uk janiw sasaw sista.
He started drinking more and more.	Jupajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw umañ qalltäna.
It’s a wonderful moment.	Uka pachax wali muspharkañawa.
But he still enjoyed doing so.	Ukampis uk lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I don’t buy into that.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit alañ munkti.
He did not know when he left.	Kunapachas sarjjäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Do it there, not here.	Ukan luram, janiw akan luramti.
He’s willing to give anyone a chance.	Jupax khitirus mä ch’am churañ munaraki.
I really didn’t know.	Chiqpachansa janiw yatkayätti.
Includes breakfast.	Ukanx desayuno ukaw utji.
Let’s do this in more detail.	Uka tuqitxa juk’ampi juk’ampi lurañäni.
I never wanted to go.	Janipuniw sarañ munkayätti.
I don't know, she thought.	Janiw yatkti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Of course, this is unbearable.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw aguantañjamäkiti.
Maybe he wanted to do it all.	Inas uka taqe kun lurañ munpachäna.
He told her about it a few days later.	Mä qhawqha urunak qhepatwa uka toqet yatiyäna.
You know, always bigger.	Jumax yatisktawa, sapa kutiw juk’amp jach’a.
Let me know as soon as possible.	Nayax jank’akiw yatiyapxita.
He didn’t know anything yet.	Jupax janiw kuns jichhakamax yatkänti.
I’m afraid to walk.	Nayax sarnaqañ axsaratwa.
It seemed too soon.	Sinti jankʼakiw ukham amuyasïna.
We will have everyone.	Jiwasax taqiniruw utjani.
I didn't say anything to him.	Nayajj janiw kunsa jupar siskti.
He’s done this before.	Jupax nayraw ukham luratayna.
He did not know the truth.	Jupajj janiw cheqpach toqet yatkänti.
What I want to do first.	Kunsa nayraqat lurañ munta.
This was the morning and the only dinner.	Akax alwaw ukat sapakiw manq’añax utjäna.

Please let me know where he is now.	Jichhax kawkhans jikxatasi uk yatiyapxita.

So nothing really happens.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas cheqpachapun utjkiti.
Now, that seemed silly.	Jichhax, ukax mä llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
But that will be the last day.	Ukampis ukajj qhep qhepa uruw utjani.
I want to use it.	Nayax ukanak apnaqañ munta.
I want to say the word.	Nayax uka aru arsuñ munta.
I gave him a pot of beer.	Nayajj mä manqʼa cerveza churta.
That would be the best thing for me.	Ukaw nayatakejj wali askïspa.
I made my coffee.	Nayax café lurawayta.
He was in a really bad place.	Jupajj cheqapuniw mä jan wali cheqan jikjjatasïna.
I understand all of this.	Taqi ukanak sum amuyta.
Something more exciting.	Kunas juk’amp kusiskañawa.

I have to say so far, it’s pretty good.	Nayax jichhakamax ukham sañ munta, wali sumawa.

So far so good!.	Jichhakamax wali suma!.
And that is even more important.	Ukat ukax jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
He never wanted me.	Jupajj janipuniw nayar munkänti.
He never said anything he didn't mean.	Janipuniw kuntï jan sañ munkäna uk arskänti.
It was the worst thing that ever happened to him.	Jupar kunatï paskäna ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp jan waliw pasäna.
I feel a little uncomfortable.	Nayajj mä jukʼa jan waliw jikjjatasta.
But he wants it.	Ukampis jupajj uk muni.
Luraña is a very important thing.	Lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
He was as bad as she was.	Jupajj jupar uñtasit jan wali jaqënwa.

I would love to go all out.	Nayatakix taqpach sarañax wali askïspawa.
Or maybe something else entirely.	Jan ukax inas yaqha tuqit taqpach lurañax wakischispa.
Don’t skip school.	Janiw escuelar jaytañamäkiti.

You know, it never happened.	Jumax yatisktawa, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

But something about it just doesn't work for me.	Ukampis uka toqet kunas janiw nayatakejj walïkiti.
He could not go himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw sarañ puedkänti.
Left, not left.	Ch’iqa, janiwa ch’iqa.
I saw the room.	Nayax uka cuarto uñjta.
And the first time was wonderful.	Ukat nayrïr kutix wali sumapunïnwa.
That's what it meant.	Ukajj sañ munäna.

That bad snowflake.	Uka jan wali ch’uqi.
No, do these things.	Janiwa, uka lurañanak luram.
I never really liked it.	Janipuniw nayatakejj wal gustkituti.
But this is not the case.	Ukampis aka tuqitxa janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
But now he is silent.	Ukampis jichhajj amukiw jikjjatasi.
If he is safe.	Jupajj jan kuna jan waltʼäwin uñjasispa ukhajja.
I don’t think so.	Nayax janiw sasaw amuyta.
I’ve definitely felt it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham jikxatasïna.
Nothing was forthcoming.	Janiw kunas jutïrin utjkänti.
I never had a problem with it.	Janipuniw uka tuqitxa kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkitänti.
It’s really impossible, of course.	Chiqpachansa janiw lurañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
That’s all it’s called.	Ukax taqi kunatix ukax satawa.
This is the room.	Akax uka cuarto satawa.
And it is better to do it well.	Ukat sum lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
It’s almost unbelievable.	Niya janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Of course, nothing is always better.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas sapa kutix jukʼamp askïkiti.
And he knew how to do it.	Ukat jupajj uk lurañwa yatïna.
Well this is where.	Suma akax kawkhans.
He never does that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurkiti.
An important new word.	Mä wakiskir machaq aru.
The ??? 	Jupa ???
He left behind a lot of stuff.	Walja yänak jaytawayi.
Do it quietly.	Amukiw uk luram.
Not of any kind.	Janiw kuna kasta.
This one does it very well.	Akax wali sumwa uk luraski.
Really, all sorts.	Chiqpachansa, taqi kasta.
You think you’re going to have a lot of fun.	Jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta sasaw amuyasta.
Tomorrow he’d do better.	Qhipürux jupax juk’amp sum luraspäna.
I want to take some of these.	Ukanakat mä qhawqha apsuñ munta.
But he started taking it more and more.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼampiw ukanak apsuñ qalltäna.
And let's do more.	Ukat jukʼamp lurañäni.
What will it be for you?.	¿Kunas jumatakix utjani?.
He wants something from me.	Jupaw nayat kuns munasi.
It really felt that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham amuyasïna.
And he began to work.	Ukat jupax irnaqañ qalltäna.
I love these a lot.	Nayax ukanak walpun munta.
Who just did it.	Khitis jichhak lurawayi.
He knew it very well.	Jupax wali sum yatïna.
They know how to control me, she said.	Jupanakax nayar apnaqañ yatipxi, sasaw jupax säna.
He was barely comfortable.	Jupajj jukʼakiw sum jikjjatasïna.
Something in him.	Kunas jupan utji.
How do you see it.	Kunjamsa uk uñjta.
Tonight was the first in a week.	Jichha arumax mä semanan nayrïr kutiw utjawayi.
Things happened quickly.	Kunanakas jankʼakiw pasäna.
It’s not a good thing for me.	Janiw nayatak askïkiti.
You are the one for me.	Jumax nayatakix ukhamawa.
He feels old.	Jupajj chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
I’m feeling better.	Nayax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
This process can take hours.	Uka lurañatakejj walja horanakaw munasispa.
He can barely speak.	Jupajj jukʼakiw parlañ yati.
Of course, this would be a good thing to do.	Chiqansa, uka lurañax wali askïspawa.
Real bad, too.	Chiqpach jan wali, ukhamaraki.
And he’s still hungry.	Ukat jupax wali manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
There’s someone out there for you.	Ukanx jumatakix mayniw utji.

He was the best thing that happened to me.	Jupaw nayatak wali suma pasäna.
It will take longer than later.	Ukajj qhepat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow pasani.
Man was no different.	Jaqix janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
And everything just worked.	Ukat taqi kunas ukhamakiw irnaqäna.
This is beautiful, he says.	Akax wali sumawa, sasaw saraki.
I’m looking for one.	Nayax mä thaqhaskta.
Now he felt the same way.	Jichhajj ukhamarakiw jupajj jikjjatasïna.
He had seen it many times before.	Jupajj nayrajj walja kutiw ukham uñjäna.
It’s still a nice sight.	Wali sumaw uñjasi.
I don’t know if you know.	Nayax janiw yatkti jumax yatisktawa.
It’s also a little weird.	Ukhamaraki mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
He has a bright future ahead of him.	Jupax jutïr pachanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
That’s what everyone knows.	Ukax taqiniw yatipxi.
That seemed to be the best thing I could do.	Ukajj nayatak wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
Maybe a.	Inas mä.
I understood that he was going to leave.	Ukat sarxañ amtkäna uk sum amuyayäta.
All in all, a very good beer.	Taqi kuna, mä wali suma cerveza.
A little bit of warmth.	Mä jisk’a jisk’a junt’u uma.
I would love to do more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp lurañajj walpun munta.
Good, he thought.	Suma, sasaw amuyäna.
He walked to the house about noon.	Jupajj niya chika uruw uka utapar kayuk saräna.
He was very serious about it.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uka toqet parläna.
He walked away in silence.	Jupajj amukiw sarjjäna.
I don’t want to go inside.	Nayax janiw mantañ munkti.
No, it was important.	Janiwa, wali wakiskiriwa.
Today, of course.	Jichhürunakanxa, chiqpachansa.
I love when he does that.	Ukham luraski ukhajj walpun munasta.
It’s every day every week every year.	Ukax sapa uru sapa semana sapa mara.
He’s always in a house in town.	Jupax sapa kutiw markan mä utapan jikxatasi.
He too had a reality.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw mä cheqpachapun utjäna.
But somehow that doesn’t work.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
Just once in a while.	Mä kutikiw sapa kuti.
She really is awesome.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali muspharkañawa.
And that snowflake.	Ukat uka ch’uqi ch’uqi.
A very good one, too.	Mä wali suma, ukhamaraki.
I for some reason, that’s fine.	Nayax kunatsa, ukax wali askiwa.

I don’t ever want that to happen.	Janiw kunapachas ukham pasañap munkti.
You know how it goes with me.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams nayamp chika saraski.
A good one, actually.	Mä suma, chiqpachansa.
I think that’s a big part of the reason why.	Nayax amuyta ukax mä jach’a chiqaw kunatix kunatsa.
He wants money.	Jupax qullqi muni.
I feel the same way, kind of.	Nayax ukhamarakiw jikxatastxa, mä kasta.
What he did do.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk.
But no, it doesn't matter.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I know how to get there.	Nayax kunjams uka chiqar puriñ yatta.
I mean research on it.	Nayax uka tuqit yatxatañ sañ munta.
For a time he was gone.	Mä tiempojj janiw jupajj utjkänti.
It was discovered almost immediately.	Ukajj niya jankʼakiw jikjjatasïna.
I see him making a decision.	Nayax juparux mä amtar puriñ uñjta.
She wanted him there with her.	Jupampiw ukan jupar munäna.
So this is an important question.	Ukhamajj uka jisktʼajj wali wakiskiriwa.
And it doesn’t, it never does.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkiti, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
Where is he at? 	¿Kawkinkis jupax?
I feel it in the morning.	Nayax alwax ukham jikxatastxa.
Do it right this time .	Jichha kutin sum lurañamawa .
That says a lot, really.	Ukax walpun sañ muni, chiqpachansa.
Not right now or.	Janiw jichhax jan ukax.
But he never knew enough about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet sum yatkänti.
But they didn't do anything.	Ukampis jupanakajj janiw kuns lurkänti.
He wanted to do the same now.	Jupajj jichhajj ukhamarakiw lurañ munäna.
He took a bite out.	Jupajj mä jukʼa apsüna.
Now that’s it.	Jichhax ukax ukhamawa.
That’s how he came about.	Ukhamaw jupax jutäna.
It would be good today, all right.	Jichhürunakanx wali askïspawa, walikïskiwa.
I love going there.	Ukar sarañajj wal gustitu.
He is still doing it himself.	Jupa pachpaw wali luraski.
He didn't really want to know.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun yatiñ munkänti.
I am worried about all of you.	Nayax taqi jumanakat llakistwa.
So far this has been the best.	Jichhakamax akax wali sumaw uñjasi.
But he said so much.	Ukampis walpun säna.
But no one, after all, knows that yet.	Ukampis janiw khitis, taqe kunat sipansa, jichhakamax uk yatkti.
This one really sucked.	Akax chiqpachapuniw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
He didn't want anyone to go with him.	Jupajj janiw khitis jupamp chik sarañ munkänti.
He didn't feel like a slight.	Jupajj janiw mä jiskʼa jaqëkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
It looks more beautiful.	Jukʼamp sumaw uñjasi.
It really needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa ukax lurañaw wakisi.
I didn't want to see him.	Nayajj janiw jupar uñjañ munkayätti.
Someone already saw them.	Maynix nayratpach jupanakar uñjäna.
He didn’t want to stay.	Jupax janiw qhiparañ munäna.
And he just walked away.	Ukat jupax ukhamakiw sarxäna.
Now, this is how it goes.	Jichhax, akax kunjams saraski.
Yesterday was another busy day.	Qhipürux yaqha ch’am tukuñ uruw utjäna.
No one knows about this place.	Janiw khitis aka chiqat yatkiti.
I am sad to see him go.	Jupar sarañ uñjasajj llakitaw jikjjatasta.
The morning came nice and bright.	Alwajj wali suma ukat qhanaw purinïna.
Not bad, he thought.	Janiw jan walïkiti, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
It felt really good, actually.	Chiqpachansa wali sumaw jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.
This is really nice.	Chiqpachansa akax wali sumawa.
Now for another reason.	Jichhax yaqha tuqitxa.
But he is a bad guy.	Ukampis jupajj jan wali jaqewa.
He wants to talk to her.	Jupampiw parltʼañ muni.
But he was really looking at it.	Ukampis jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
He was very clear about it.	Jupajj wali qhanaw uka toqet parläna.
Today was the last day.	Jichhürojj qhep qhepa uruw purinïna.
And also cold.	Ukat ukhamarakiw thaya.
It’s going really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa sarnaqaski.
But now he’s in great shape.	Ukampis jichhax jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But let's look at the small word.	Ukampis jiskʼa aru uñjañäni.
I said whenever.	Nayax kunapachas sasaw sista.
I want to drink.	Nayax umañ munta.
He asked her several questions.	Jupajj walja kutiw jisktʼäna.
Yes, he didn't want to.	Jïsa, jupajj janiw munkänti.
You don’t have to do anything with anyone.	Janiw khitimpis kunsa lurañamäkiti.
I never expected anything like this.	Janipuniw ukham kuns suykayätti.
Here’s how to do it right.	Akax kunjams chiqapar lurañax uk uñjañäni.
Money is not enough.	Qullqix janiw askïkiti.
Do that and you will be miserable.	Ukham luram ukat jumax llakitaw jikxatasïta.
A silence stole from him.	Mä amukiw juparux lunthatasïna.
How long did that feel like.	¿Qhawqha tiempos ukajj ukham amuyasïna.
And no, it can’t be.	Ukat janiw, janiw ukax utjkaspati.
You have him all the time.	Jumax juparux sapa kutiw utji.
Time, too, is of no consequence.	Tiempojj ukhamarakiw janiw kunäkisa.
Beyond the baseball about baseball part, of course.	Béisbol tuqit béisbol tuqit chiqat sipansa, chiqpachansa.
Really, really awesome film.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ película.
And it’s completely anonymous.	Ukat taqpach jan uñt’atawa.
He was serious about it.	Uka tuqitxa jupax wali amuyumpiw arsüna.
You can do two things at once.	Mä kutikiw pä lurañanak lurasma.
But that was not the case for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
I was never quite sure about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet sum yatkayätti.
And now here it is.	Ukat jichhax akham.
Sure, he can do that.	Chiqpachansa, jupax ukham luraspawa.
But he felt there was no other option.	Ukampis janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkaspati sasaw jupajj amuyasïna.
Who cares what he does.	Khitis kuntï jupajj luraski uk uñji.
But that really doesn't mean anything.	Ukampis ukajj cheqpachapun janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
Everything was for the best.	Taqi kunas wali suma lurañatakiw utjäna.
He said he needed to do that.	Ukham lurañaw wakisi sasaw säna.
And he meant it with all his heart.	Ukat taqi chuymaw uka arunak sañ munäna.
I don’t know how or why.	Kunjamsa ni kunatsa uk janiw yatkti.
I never knew who did it.	Janipuniw khitis uk lurkäna uk yatkayätti.
Once he goes to school, it’s even better.	Mä kutix yatiqañ utar sarxani ukhax juk’amp askiwa.
So it was, so it was.	Ukhamajj ukhamänwa, ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
It’s quiet a good time.	Ukax amukiw mä suma pachanx.

Because it’s quick.	Kunatix jank’akiw.
But he did everything.	Ukampis jupajj taqe kunwa luräna.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Janiw kuna jan wali lurañas nayan utjkiti.
He felt a little like that himself.	Jupa pachpaw mä jukʼa ukham jikjjatasïna.
It was just like last time.	Ukajj kunjamtï pasïr kuti lurkäna ukhamänwa.
After a few days, don't forget.	Mä qhawqha urunak qhepatjja, jan armasimti.
He didn't want to see it for himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpa uñjañ munkänti.
There and here.	Ukan ukat akan.
I want to see it there myself.	Naya pachpaw ukan uñjañ munta.
Because it’s so common.	Kunatix ukax wali uñt’atawa.

There is a stunning sense of crime.	Ukanjja, jan walinak lurañajj wali muspharkañawa.

That’s not something you need to do.	Ukax janiw kuna lurañas wakiskiti.

You have all morning.	Jumax taqpach alwaw utji.

No, it doesn’t mean that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
In fact, it never was.	Chiqansa, janipuniw kunapachas utjkänti.
It needs to be worse again.	Wasitat jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
That’s exactly where it is.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kawkhans utji.

I can do a lot of words.	Nayax walja arunak lurañ yatta.
To be honest, it happens all the time.	Chiqpachansa, sapa kutiw ukham lurañax utji.
He 's a	Jupax .

I’m going to go alone.	Naya sapakiw sarä.
And it gets better and better.	Ukat juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He did not say he remembered it all.	Jupajj janiw taqe ukanak amtaskti siskänti.
No one should do this alone.	Janiw khitis sapak uk lurañapäkiti.
But somehow, yes.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, jïsa.
Not about that or that.	Janiw uka tuqitxa ni uka tuqitxa.
You feel comfortable, you know what you’re doing.	Jumax sum jikxatasïta, kuntï luraskta uk yatisktawa.

I’m always worried about it.	Nayax sapa kutiw uka tuqit llakista.

But you can still do something new.	Ukampis jumax wali sumwa machaq lurañanak lurasma.
It works for me here.	Aka chiqanx nayatakix wali askiwa.
Bigger, that's better.	Jach'a, ukax juk'amp askiwa.
Something hit him hard, and it hit him.	Kunas wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna, ukat juparux ch’allt’äna.
It needed more light.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp qhanaw munasïna.
He never really said that.	Jupajj janipuniw cheqpachapun ukham siskänti.
I’ve never seen anything like this.	Janipuniw kuns ukham uñjkti.

And so far so good.	Ukat jichhakamax wali sumawa.
She was even more surprised to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj jukʼampiw muspharäna.
Or he tried to do so.	Jan ukajj ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
That was pretty much everything.	Ukajj niya taqe kunaw utjäna.
But he didn't tell her about it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uka toqet jupar siskänti.
It doesn't matter how he knew.	Kunjamsa yatïna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
It's not necessary anymore.	Janiw juk'ampi wakiskiti.

And for me .	Ukat nayatakix .

So far.	Sinti jaya.

But that's all you know.	Ukampis ukakiw jumajj yatta.
It scared him more than he wanted to admit.	Ukajj kuntï iyaw sañ munkäna ukat sipansa jukʼampiw jupar ajjsaräna.
No one is with you.	Janiw khitis jumamp chika.
But he wanted better than she did.	Ukampis jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa munpachäna.
It was a really small space.	Chiqpachansa mä jisk’a chiqaw utjäna.
And they’re not good enough for you.	Ukat jupanakax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.
You don’t want to go there.	Jumax janiw ukar sarañ munktati.
You do the watching.	Jumaw uñjañ lurasma.
He didn't want to go home just yet.	Jupajj janiw jichhak utar sarañ munkänti.
There is no need to do anything wrong.	Janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas wakiskiti.
But there is one big drawback.	Ukampis mä jachʼa jan waliw utji.
So that makes it even more exciting.	Ukhamajj ukajj jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
He never wanted to talk to her again.	Janipuniw mayamps jupamp parlañ munkänti.
So let me know what you think.	Ukhamajj kuntï jumajj amuykta uk yatiyapjjeta.
Everything was great, everyone needed it.	Taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa, taqiniw wakisïna.
He stayed here a week or so.	Jupajj mä semana jan ukajj mä semanaw akan qheparäna.
But it doesn’t work well.	Ukampis janiw sum lurkiti.
I didn't want to see you.	Nayajj janiw jumar uñjañ munkayätti.
Someone is definitely out there.	Maynix chiqpachapuniw uka chiqanx jikxatasi.
He hopes to do well.	Jupax sum lurañ suyt’i.
He has to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañapawa.
I started moving away.	Nayax yaqha chiqar sarxañ qalltawayta.
It went the way he wanted it to.	Kunjamtï jupax munkäna ukhamaw saräna.
It feels really good to do nothing.	Chiqpachansa jan kuns lurañaw wali suma jikxatasi.
He felt something else.	Jupajj yaqha toqetwa amuyasïna.
You'll feel better.	Jumax juk'amp sumaw jikxatasïta.
And he said it again.	Ukat jupajj wasitatwa säna.
He wanted it more than ever before.	Jupajj nayrajj jukʼampiw ukanak munäna.
He didn't say anything the whole time.	Taqi uka tiempox janiw kuns arskänti.
And one night .	Ukat mä arumax .
This was a lot.	Akax walja ukhamänwa.
But you didn’t know that, of course.	Ukampis janiw uk yatkayätati, chiqpachansa.
I need an hour.	Nayax mä horaw munta.
That’s all we need to do now.	Jichhax ukakiw lurañax wakisi.
I can't think of anything else.	Janiw yaqha amuytʼirjamäkti.
Let him do what he has to do.'	Kuntï lurañapäki uk lurañapawa’.
Two things happened exactly at the same time.	Pä kunas chiqpachapuniw pachpa pachan pasäna.
It was the little man.	Ukajj uka jiskʼa jaqënwa.
But the reality is shocking.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
He said there was nothing he could do.	Janiw kunas lurañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
I didn’t really do that.	Nayax janiw chiqpachansa uk lurkti.
That’s everything .	Ukax taqi kunas .
After that, repeat.	Uka qhepatjja, mayamp lurañamawa.
There is no such time now.	Jichhax ukham pachax janiw utjkiti.
But it goes every day or so.	Ukampis sapa uru jan ukajj niya ukhamarakiw saraski.
I thought that would be good.	Ukajj wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
That’s fine, but that’s it.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukampis ukax ukhamawa.
He wanted to live in this house.	Jupax aka utan jakañ munäna.
That really isn’t necessary.	Chiqpachansa ukax janiw wakiskiti.
And, it feels good.	Ukat, wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He doesn't go.	Jupajj janiw sarkiti.
But you are better .	Ukampis jumajj jukʼamp askiwa .
I would definitely buy them all again.	Chiqpachansa taqi ukanak wasitat alañ munta.
As if he knew exactly what was going on.	Kunas pasaski uk sum yatkaspa ukhama.
Something happened there.	Ukanjja kunas pasäna.
And it wasn’t the first time.	Ukat janiw nayrïr kuti ukhamäkänti.
I won’t ride anywhere else.	Janiw yaqha cheqar kayuk sarkäti.
Let’s do this in two ways.	Ukxa pä tuqit lurañäni.
Things though, really things.	Kunanakas ukampis, chiqpachansa kunanakas.
I’m obviously doing something wrong.	Nayax qhanaw jan walinak luraskta.
It will take some time.	Mä juk’a pachaw munasini.
The man was very knowledgeable.	Uka jaqejj wali sum yatiñ yatïna.
It was a very night.	Mä wali arumaw utjäna.
It doesn’t cost a bit.	Janiw mä juk’a qullqix utjkiti.
He accepted the responsibility.	Jupajj uka lurañanak katoqäna.
Three times more.	Kimsa kuti juk’ampi.
He meant the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk sañ munäna.
This is kind of fun, actually.	Akax mä juk’a kusiskañawa, chiqpachansa.
But there is no secret otherwise.	Ukampis janiw yaqha tuqitxa jamasat utjkiti.
And another, slightly bigger one.	Ukat yaqha, ukat sipansa mä jukʼa jachʼa.
No one knows exactly why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
It’s already visible.	Ukax niyaw uñjasi.
Well, really, no.	Ukhama, chiqpachansa, janiwa.
One can’t do that kind of stuff fast enough.	Maynix janiw uka kasta yänak jank’ak lurañjamäkiti.
Now with him.	Jichhax jupamp chika.
Tell me a year, you tell me.	Mä mara yatiyapxita, jumanakax yatiyapxita.
He looks pleased with himself.	Jupax jupa pachpat kusisit uñnaqaniwa.
He said everything and did nothing.	Jupajj taqe kunwa parläna ukat janiw kuns lurkänti.
But they’re okay.	Ukampis jupanakax walikïskiwa.
He’s a cool guy.	Jupax mä thaya jaqiwa.
Rock and more rock.	Qala ukat juk’amp qala.
That is the work we need to do together.	Uka lurañaw mayachtʼasis lurañasa.
It’s actually a good thing.	Chiqpachansa ukax walikïskiwa.
He’s decided to do it.	Jupax uka lurañ amtawayi.
Or a red wine.	Jan ukajj mä wila vino.
I came here first.	Nayax nayraqat akan jutta.
I think you can do the same thing man.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jumajj pachpa lurasma chachajja.
He passed by cautiously.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uka cheqar pasäna.
That was all he talked about.	Ukajj taqe kunaw jupajj parläna.
Hours of homework afterwards.	Uka qhepatjja, walja horanakaw tareanak lurañapa.
I thought there would always be time.	Nayax sapa kutiw tiempox utjani sasaw amuyayäta.
One doesn’t know the other.	Maynix maynix janiw yatkiti.
Eventually, I may feel differently.	Qhepatjja, inas yaqha ukham amuyasta.
One is well known and the other is less well known.	Maynix wali uñt’atawa ukat maynix juk’amp jan uñt’atawa.
You never know what will happen.	Kunas pasani uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
A new location will be available soon.	Mä machaq chiqaw niyaw utjani.
About ten years ago.	Niya tunka mara nayra.
It's funny how I remember that.	Kunjamsa uka amtaskta ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
He said he gave me strength.	Jupax ch’am churitu sasaw säna.
He is the young man.	Jupajj uka waynawa.
I make coffee at home.	Nayax utan café lurañ yatta.
I have it every morning.	Nayax sapa alwaw ukax utjitu.
But it didn't mean what you think.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jumajj amuykta uk sañ munkänti.
I thought the going word was clear.	Nayax sarañ arut qhanaw sasaw amuyayäta.
Later,	Qhepatjja, .
He had no idea, or didn't know.	Jupajj janiw kuns amuykänti, jan ukajj janiw yatkänti.
So and so and so.	Ukham ukat ukham.
Good little book.	Suma jisk’a libro.
I understand the moment.	Nayax uka pacharuw amuyasta.
I just might.	Nayax ukhamakiw inas.
Probably more, actually.	Inas juk’ampi, chiqpachansa.
You know the cost.	Jumax yatisktawa kuna qullqis utji.
Actually anything though.	Chiqansa kunas ukampis.
Bad but a little better now.	Jan wali ukampis mä juk’a juk’amp suma jichhax.
It knocked some of the air out of him.	Ukajj mä jukʼa thaya jupat jaqontäna.
Things happen fast, that's all.	Kunanakas jankʼakiw utji, ukakiw.
He wanted the best for you.	Jupajj jumatak jukʼamp sumwa munäna.
He thought he was a better person.	Jupajj jukʼamp suma jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
You see a city here.	Jumax mä markaruw aka chiqanx uñjta.
That should go somewhere.	Ukaw kawkirus sarañapa.
Therefore, this	Ukatwa aka .
I'm because.	Nayax kunatix.
I love him, for that.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta, ukatakix.
There are many of these.	Walja ukanakaw ukanak utji.
It took a big step.	Ukatakejj mä jachʼa lurañaw wakisïna.
But there is nowhere else to go.	Ukampis janiw yaqha cheqar sarañatak utjkiti.
There is no need or reason.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti ni kuna razonas utjkiti.
There he went, again he did too much.	Ukaruw saräna, wasitatwa sinti jan walinak luräna.
He was quiet during the drive.	Uka auto apnaqañ pachanx jupax amukiw jikxatasïna.
He later died.	Jupajj qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
He said something quickly.	Jankʼakiw kuns arsüna.
He said he didn’t see another door.	Jupax janiw yaqha punku uñjkti sasaw säna.
I think you’ll enjoy it.	Nayax amuyta, jumax kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
She knew everything about him then.	Uka tiemponjja, jupat taqe kunwa yatïna.
The real person is rare.	Chiqpach jaqix juk’akiw utji.
Or you can't do that.	Jan ukajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
He’s pretty bright, actually.	Jupax wali qhanawa, chiqpachansa.
I know what happened to me.	Kunas nayar pasäna uk sum yatta.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Jupajj janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkänti.
It’s the same light.	Ukax pachpa qhanawa.
They are the real reason what happened happened.	Jupanakax chiqpach kunatsa kunatix paskäna ukax pasäna.
It was as if he didn't know.	Jan yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He said no, never.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janipuniw ukhamäkiti sasaw säna.
One thing more.	Mä kunaw juk’ampi.
Because we are and .	Kunatix jiwasax ukat .

Now, there will be none.	Jichhax, janiw kunas utjkaniti.
Like you said yourself.	Kunjamtï juma pachpa siskta ukhama.
And someone says something.	Ukat maynix kuns arsu.
I’m happy doing creative stuff.	Nayax kusisitaw lurañ yänak luraskta.
No money means no housing.	Jan qullqix jan uta lurañ sañ muni.
Or I saw some still photos.	Jan ukax mä qawqha wali fotonak uñjta.
He finally started talking.	Jupax qhipharux parlañ qalltäna.
I’m so happy for you, you know.	Nayax jumatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, jumax yatisktawa.
I don’t want to walk in the rain.	Nayax janiw jallu pachan sarnaqañ munkti.
I’ve done it very hard.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw uk lurawayta.
I started on it this morning.	Jichha alwaw uka tuqit qalltawayta.
Neither of these things.	Janiw kunas uka pä tuqitxa.

I’m not going to school.	Janiw escuelar sarkäti.
You know this stuff better than I do.	Jumax aka yänak nayat sipan juk’amp sum yatta.

He doesn’t work well.	Jupax janiw sum irnaqkiti.
I won't do that here.	Janiw nayajj akan ukham lurkäti.
There will be plenty of time for that.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow utjani.
That’s how we’ll have to do that.	Ukhamaw ukham lurañax wakisini.
This is the first time in the country.	Akax nayrïr kutiw markanx utji.
Of course this was not the case.	Chiqansa akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
That could be the real problem.	Ukaw cheqpach jan waltʼäwejj utjaspa.
Something needed to be done better.	Kunas jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisïna.
But it’s all good, anyway.	Ukampis taqe kunas wali askiwa, kunjamatsa.
Do what you are passionate about.	Kuntï jumajj wal munkta uk luram.

But, this .	Ukampis, aka .

This can take some time.	Ukajj mä qhawqha tiempow utjaspa.
He knew how bad he was.	Jupajj kunjamsa jan wali jaqëtap yatïna.
He didn’t know how to walk.	Jupax janiw sarnaqañ yatkänti.
I’ve definitely done it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw lurawayta.
He’s awesome, he can do it.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa, jupax uk luraspawa.
I never thought of him.	Janipuniw jupar amuyirïkti.
About a week passed.	Niya mä semanaw pasäna.
So how do you do that.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa uk lurasma.
It doesn’t really matter.	Janiw chiqpachansa kunäkisa.
The house party.	Uka uta fiesta.
This is the most surprising to me.	Akax nayatakix juk’amp muspharkañawa.
He loved you so much.	Jupajj walpun jumar munasïna.
Never ridden it.	Janipuniw ukat kayuk sarawayta.
First day all day.	Nayrïr uru taqpach uru.
There’s also a nice restaurant here.	Ukhamarakiw mä suma manq’añ utax akanx utji.
But then he just sat there.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, ukhamakiw qontʼasïna.
But he’s what he wants.	Ukampis jupax kuntï jupax munki ukawa.
I still feel sad all day, every day.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatastxa taqi uru, sapa uru.

I’m much happier.	Nayax juk’amp kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
That’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.	Ukax nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
We have to do this many times.	Walja kutiw uk lurañasa.
A little bit of blood.	Mä juk’a wila.
I don’t know what to do.	Janiwa nayax yatkti.
And he was happy every time he did.	Ukat sapa kutiw ukham lurkäna ukhajj kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But he couldn't do everything.	Ukampis janiw taqe kun lurañ puedkänti.
I started sleeping.	Nayax ikiñ qalltawayta.
He accepted you.	Jupajj jumaruw katoqäna.
He learned the language.	Jupaw uka aru yateqäna.
I have no idea what could happen.	Nayax janiw kuns amuykti, kunas pasaspa.
He wanted to see how.	Kunjamsa uk uñjañ munäna.
He left a lot to be desired.	Jupajj wal jaytawayi.
That’s how this feels for me.	Ukhamaw akax nayatakix jikxatasi.
It might happen to me.	Inas nayatakejj ukham pasaspa.
There’s nothing like you.	Janiw kunas jumar uñtasit utjkiti.
Good or bad, that matters.	Suma jan ukax jan wali, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
Or the truth.	Jan ukax chiqa.

It’s really worth it .	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa .
It is a good place to go to school.	Uka yatiqañ utar sarañatakix wali askiwa.
It was what he told her.	Ukajj kuntï jupar siskäna ukawa.
I don’t know if anyone does.	Janiw khitis uk lurkiti janicha uk yatkti.
We’ll do it the way you do it.	Jiwasax kunjams jumax lurasma uk lurañäni.
It’s time to go out on your own.	Juma pachpa mistuñ pachaw purini.
But this is not always the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sapa kuti ukhamäkiti.
And now, for once.	Ukat jichhax, mä kutikiw.
I wonder who will come.	Khitis jutani sasaw jisktʼasta.
I didn’t have to do all that.	Janiw taqi ukanak lurañax wakiskänti.
I don’t remember that year.	Janiw uka mara amtaskti.
But it wasn't, and no one knows why.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He does everything himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqe kunsa luri.
That’s clearly what we have here.	Ukaw qhanaw akan utjistu.
I’m definitely going to do that.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukham lurañ amtasta.
There will be another time.	Yaqha pachax utjani.
Just like he was supposed to.	Kunjamtï jupajj lurañapäkäna ukhama.
He really felt that way.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham jikjjatasïna.
I think he’s still tough, wherever he is.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali ch’amawa, kawkhans jikxatasi.
Or, better yet, more of it.	Jan ukax, juk’amp askiwa, ukat juk’ampi.
There was no time limit.	Janiw mä tiempojj utjkänti.
What’s great is where you can find it.	Kunatix wali jach’a ukax kawkhans jikxatasi.
He could not eat lunch.	Jupajj janiw chika uru manqʼañ puedkänti.
Which he knows well.	Ukajj jupajj sum yati.
Very good so far.	Wali sumaw jichhakamax.
But he got what he wanted.	Ukampis kuntï munkäna uk katoqäna.
Now it’s clear he wants to leave.	Jichhax qhanaw jupax sarxañ muni.

Yes, all of these things can happen.	Jïsa, taqe ukanakaw pasaspa.
You agree with this.	Jumax uka tuqitx iyaw satawa.
But there’s really nothing you can do.	Ukampis chiqpachapunix janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
He knew what the man meant.	Kuntï uka jaqejj sañ munkäna uk sum yatïna.
This time around .	Aka kutix .
He has done a lot more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw walja lurawayi.
He said it was wonderful.	Jupajj wali sumapunïnwa sasaw säna.
He received the book.	Jupaw uka libro katoqäna.
This guy is a bad guy.	Aka jaqix jan wali jaqiwa.
It’s such a surprise in a small room.	Mä jisk’a cuarto ukanx ukham muspharkañawa.

There is no need to rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañax wakiskiti.
Really, really good.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa suma.
But every morning.	Ukampis sapa alwaw.
In fact, there is everything, really.	Chiqansa, taqi kunaw utji, chiqpachansa.
I wasn't trying to suggest it.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit amuytʼayañ munkayätti.
I didn't want to go with him.	Nayajj janiw jupamp sarañ munkayätti.
I want too many things.	Nayax sinti walja yänak munta.
The man agreed that it was.	Uka jaqejj ukhamänwa sasaw iyaw säna.
That’s exactly what we need to do.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw lurañasa.
That’s good, too.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukhamaraki.
This is one of the more common ones.	Akax mä juk’amp uñt’atawa.
And, I think that’s fine.	Ukat, nayatakix ukax walikïskiwa.
Something that wasn't there before.	Kunatï nayrajj jan utjkänti.
You know it’s cool.	Jumax yatisktawa ukax wali sumawa.

He was still hungry.	Jupax wali manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
What’s going on in this country.	Kunas aka markanx utji.
None of that, really.	Janiw kunas uka tuqitxa, chiqpachansa.

Well, baseball doesn’t like that.	Ukhama, béisbol ukax janiw ukham munkiti.
I couldn’t think of anyone but myself.	Naya pachpat sipansa janiw khitirus amuyirïkti.
But they all exist.	Ukampis taqeniw utji.
It’s actually kind of weird.	Chiqansa mä kasta muspharkañawa.

There’s no one else to do it.	Janiw khitis yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
I need some urgent help.	Mä jukʼa jankʼak yanaptʼa munta.
I couldn't understand why he didn't do it now.	Kunatsa jichhajj jan luri uk janiw amuykayätti.
There was nowhere to eat fast.	Janiw kawkhans jank’ak manq’añax utjkänti.
So he knew everything about me.	Ukatwa jupajj nayat taqe kun yatïna.
I wait for the night.	Nayax arumaw suyt’ta.
Do a good job on one or two things.	Mä jan ukax pä tuqit mä suma irnaqäw lurañamawa.
That is the best question of all.	Uka jisktʼajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.

Financially at least.	Qullqi tuqitxa mä juk’a.
It went really well.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa sarnaqäna.
It was real, but it was just that.	Ukajj cheqapuniw utjäna, ukampis ukhamakiw utjäna.
But that doesn't work.	Ukampis ukham lurasax janiw irnaqkiti.
Yeah, someone definitely knows.	Jïsa, maynix chiqpachapuniw yati.
Now I know that this is not the case.	Jichhajj yattwa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I have always loved the word.	Nayax nayratpach uka arunak walpun munasta.

It’s supposed to be bigger.	Ukax juk’amp jach’a sañ muni.
And, you know, that was it.	Ukat, jumax yatisktawa, ukax ukhamänwa.
But he never knew what happened to him.	Ukampis kunas jupat pasäna uk janipuniw yatkänti.
He knew how and when to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa ukat kunapachas lurañapa uk sum yatïna.
He had no idea what was inside.	Jupajj kunas uka manqhan utjäna uk janiw amuykänti.

But I want it obviously.	Ukampis nayajj qhanaw munta.

He wanted to work.	Jupax irnaqañ munäna.
He thought he didn’t know what it was.	Jupax janiw kunas uk yatkiti sasaw amuyäna.
Make it your own way you want.	Kunjamtï munkta uk juma pachpa luram.

He felt like he was two people.	Jupajj pä jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He needed nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunsa wakiskänti.
Fortunately, he did.	Wali askiwa, jupajj ukhamarakiw luräna.

As much as he longed for it.	Kunjamtï jupajj wal munkäna ukhama.
There’s definitely truth to that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa chiqaw utji.
But it is not enough to help.	Ukampis janiw yanaptʼañatakejj wakiskiti.

Of course, all of these things.	Chiqansa, taqi ukanak lurañaw wakisi.
Do what you think is right.	Kuntï jumax amuykta uk lurañamawa.
And that ended it for me.	Ukat ukax nayatakix tukuyäna.
Do as much as anyone can.	Kunjamtï khitis lurañjamäki ukham lurañamawa.
He could have done anything, anything.	Jupax kuns luraspänwa, kuns luraspänwa.
But there was something worse than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan waliw utjäna.
This is the best thing for you.	Akax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I still don't understand all of this.	Jichhakamajj janiw taqe ukanak amuykti.
He doesn't know what to do.	Jupajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkiti.
I wasn’t too surprised.	Janiw sinti muspharkayätti.
I wonder what happened.	Kunas pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
Not bad, but weird.	Janiw jan walïkiti, jan ukasti muspharkañawa.
I’m still quiet.	Nayax wali amukiw jikxatastxa.
I now understand why.	Kunatsa uk jichhajj amuyasta.
He gave more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw churäna.
Not what he wanted obviously.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
And what happens next.	Ukat kunas uka qhepat pasani.
He doesn’t, not really.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
That didn't seem to make sense.	Ukajj janis wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
These are very obvious.	Ukanakax wali qhanaw uñjasi.
After that, he does nothing.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kuns lurkiti.
A small, flat piece.	Mä jisk’a, ch’uqi ch’uqi.
This is often impossible.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He wanted to talk to her about it.	Jupampiw uka toqet parltʼañ munäna.
So therefore .	Ukhamajj ukhamajj .
And it took longer than later.	Ukat jukʼampiw qhepat sipansa jukʼamp tiempojj pasäna.
It’s worth a while.	Mä juk’a pachax wali askiwa.
And it’s worth it in that regard.	Ukat uka tuqitxa wali askiwa.
But that one will.	Ukampis uka mayniw ukham lurani.
I never thought .	Janipuniw amuyirïkti .
Every night he understood better.	Sapa arumaw jukʼamp sum amuyäna.
Maybe apart from himself.	Inas jupa pachpat yaqha tuqitxa.
He was determined with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw amtäna.
Is everything okay? 	¿Taqe kunas walikïskiti?
He was nobody, nobody.	Jupax janiw khitis, janiw khitis ukhamäkänti.
I’ve never been there.	Nayax janipuniw sarkti.
Thankfully, that was not the case here.	Ukajj janiw aka cheqan utjkänti, ukajj walpun yuspärta.
I don't think so myself.	Naya pachpajj janiw ukham siskti.
But it’s not bad at all.	Ukampis janiw kunjamatsa jan walïkiti.
More and more and more!.	¡Juk’ampi juk’ampi juk’ampi!.
I just don't know what it is.	Nayajj janiw kunäkisa uk sum yatkti.
But that will take a day or two.	Ukampis ukajj mä uru jan ukajj pä uruw pasani.
That’s what happened that day.	Ukaw uka urux pasäna.
Very sad about this.	Wali llakitaw aka tuqitxa.
Everything you know.	Taqi kunatix jumax yatisktawa.
He seemed to be in good shape.	Jupajj wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
All of this is impossible now.	Taqi ukanakax jichhax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
After that, it doesn't matter.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kunäkisa.
Timing was everything.	Tiempojj taqe kunaw utjäna.
He wants to make something of himself.	Jupax jupa pachpat kuns lurañ muni.
I wasn’t saying the truth at any point.	Janiw kuna horasas cheqäki uk sañ munkayätti.
It was about ten o'clock.	Niya tunka arumaw purinïna.
I want to go.	Sarañ munta.
I didn’t say anything.	Janiw nayax kuns siskti.
I know it takes time.	Nayax yattwa ukax tiempow munasi.
I don’t think it really matters now.	Jichhax janiw chiqpachapunix wakiskiti sasaw amuyta.
It’s also a good chunk.	Ukhamaraki mä suma ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Two things happened immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw pä kunas pasäna.
I didn't know about it.	Janiw nayajj ukanak yatkayätti.
Where is the rest?.	¿Kawkhans uka qhipharux utji?.
I see more life.	Nayax juk’amp jakañ uñjta.
He started walking.	Sarnaqañ qalltäna.
And that is an important question.	Ukat uka jisktʼajj wali wakiskiriwa.
I don’t want to be alone.	Janiw naya sapak sarnaqañ munkti.
We’ll see how this season goes.	Kunjamsa aka pachax saraski uk uñjañäni.
Let’s see what happens in the future.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
That’s what feels really good.	Ukaw chiqpachansa wali sum jikxatasi.
I don’t want to know, really.	Janiw yatiñ munkti, chiqpachansa.
Both are fun and challenging to do.	Panpachaniw kusiskañawa ukat lurañax ch’amawa.
It takes a lot of energy.	Mä jach’a ch’amaw wakisi.
It was again very good.	Ukax wasitat wali sumapunïnwa.
I’ll take care of that.	Nayax uka tuqit uñjañäni.
I said no, it would be better.	Nayax janiw, juk’amp askïspawa sasaw sista.
He doesn’t know anything about it.	Jupax janiw kuns uka tuqit yatkiti.
But try to make it longer.	Ukampis jukʼamp jaya tiempo lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
He was very happy to do so.	Uk lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I'm not sure what's good.	Kunas wali askïspa uk janiw sum yatkti.
This is a man who can do anything.	Akax mä jaqiwa, jupax kuns luraspawa.
This is better this season and next season.	Akax juk’amp askiwa aka pachanx ukat jutir pachanx.
He wanted to see her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar uñjañ munäna.
I have heard so much about you.	Nayajj jumanakat wal istʼta.
I want that very much.	Uk walpun munta.
But that’s exactly what can happen here.	Ukampis ukax chiqpachapuniw akanx utjaspa.
Now, that’s good enough.	Jichhax, ukax wali askiwa.
Maybe once a month.	Inas phaxsin mä kuti.
But I don’t see that.	Ukampis janiw uk uñjkti.
There are people who .	Ukanjja, jaqenakajj .
I want to know!.	¡Nayaw yatiñ munta!.
That doesn’t appeal to me.	Ukax janiw nayatakix wali askïkiti.
This can happen in one of two ways.	Ukajj pä toqetwa mä toqetwa pasaspa.
He started drinking again.	Jupax wasitat umañ qalltäna.
I’ve always wanted to say that.	Nayax nayratpachaw ukham sañ munta.
I have no idea what happened to him after that.	Uka qhepat kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
She told him the same.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jupar yatiyäna.
And there’s really nothing to do here.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
But he knew he didn't.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurkänti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I saw that thing today.	Jichhürunakanxa uka kunsa uñjta.
It’s so often pretty much everywhere.	Ukhamaw sapa kutix niya taqi chiqan utji.
I was rather surprised by this myself.	Naya pachpaw uka tuqitxa jukʼamp muspharta.
The snow, the cold.	Uka ch’uqi, thaya.
I’ve actually seen it.	Chiqpachansa uñjta.
So I don't see anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuns uñjkti.
She thought he wanted to go with her.	Jupampiw sarañ muni sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
People are important to me.	Jaqinakax nayatakix wali askiwa.
This was the first year.	Akax nayrïr maraw utjäna.
I don't like it.	Nayajj janiw gustkituti.
The first thing.	Nayrïr kuna.
You can have it too.	Jumax ukhamarakiw utjaspa.
I didn’t want to stay.	Janiw qheparañ munkayätti.
That’s amazing, she admits.	Ukax muspharkañawa, sasaw jupax arsu.
That makes me very happy.	Ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He was always willing to help.	Jupajj sapa kutiw yanaptʼañ munäna.
He means more, more, deeper.	Jupax juk’amp sañ muni, juk’amp sañ muni, juk’amp manqhan sañ muni.
They like you a lot, too.	Jupanakajj jumar wal gusti, ukhamaraki.
But it really is rare.	Ukampis chiqpachansa jukʼakiw utji.
Everything he does is amazing.	Taqi kunatix jupax luraski ukax wali muspharkañawa.
There will be no future here.	Aka chiqanx janiw jutïr pachax utjkaniti.
For the first time ever.	Nayrïr kutiw jupajj ukham luräna.
Nobody knows what they are.	Kuntï jupanakax uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I hope to do the same here.	Nayax ukhamarakiw aka chiqan lurañ suyt’askta.
He can never have the truth.	Jupajj janipuniw kunatï cheqäki ukajj utjkaspati.
The rain is coming too hard for me.	Jallux nayatakix wali ch’amampiw purini.
And now he saw them.	Ukat jichhax jupanakar uñjäna.
Maybe actually really.	Inas chiqpachansa chiqpachansa.
Now, it's better.	Jichhax, juk'amp askiwa.
It always feels bad.	Sapa kutiw jan walin uñjasi.
He’s a better person.	Jupax juk’amp suma jaqiwa.
Or pretty so and so.	Jan ukax wali suma ukham ukat ukham.
But he never said that to anyone.	Ukampis janipuniw khitirus ukham siskänti.
I thought it was the cool place.	Nayax thaya chiqaw sasaw amuyayäta.
It’s good to go for lunch.	Chika uru sarañax wali askiwa.
I drink, obviously.	Nayax umañ yatta, qhanawa.
He knew how to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañwa yatïna.
I want some clarity.	Nayax mä juk’a qhanaw munta.
He saw them from every angle.	Jupajj taqe toqetwa jupanakar uñjäna.
I am so worried about you guys.	Nayax jumanakat wal llakista.
There’s more space.	Ukanx juk’amp chiqaw utji.
I actually thought he did pretty well last night.	Chiqansa, jupax qhipa arumax wali sum lurawayi sasaw amuyayäta.
Very old school.	Wali nayra yatiqañ uta.
A strange, impossible place.	Mä muspharkañ, jan lurañjamäki uka chiqa.
But you definitely think of me first.	Ukampis jumajj nayarojj cheqapuniw nayraqat amuyta.
It really does exist.	Chiqpachansa ukaw utji.
But ultimately, it is fun.	Ukampis qhepatjja, wali kusiskañawa.
You don’t want to know enough.	Jumax janiw sum yatxatañ munktati.
One more thing about this.	Aka tuqitxa mä juk’ampi.
But he’s still happy.	Ukampis jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
I mean it’s really hard.	Chiqpachansa ch’amaw sañ munta.
Another warm day.	Yaqha junt’u uru.
The man was clearly surprised.	Uka jaqejj qhanaw muspharäna.
You’re a good guy, actually.	Jumax wali suma jaqiwa, chiqpachansa.
He went quiet and very, very quiet.	Jupax amukiw saräna ukat wali, wali amukiw saräna.
I don’t want that other room.	Janiw uka yaqha cuarto munkti.
So maybe yes.	Ukhamajj inas jïsa.
I said that’s good enough.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw sista.
But these are not the right things to do.	Ukampis ukanak lurañajj janiw walïkiti.
He finished well.	Jupajj wali sumwa tukuyäna.
I’m really looking forward to it.	Chiqpachansa nayax wali suyt’askta.
And nobody does anything.	Ukat janiw khitis kuns lurkiti.
And he has to do it again.	Ukat wasitatwa lurañapa.
In it, he said he was sorry for her feelings.	Ukanjja, kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk llakistwa sasaw säna.
Now I was terrified.	Jichhajj walpun ajjsarayäta.
I love that car.	Uka autot walpun munasta.
He saw what that would do.	Kunsa ukajj lurani uk uñjäna.
He somehow stole a book.	Jupajj kunjamatsa mä libro lunthatasïna.
It’s very long and it’s hard.	Wali jaya wali ch’amawa.
I want that too!.	¡Nayajj ukhamarakiw munta!.
These people don’t exist.	Uka jaqinakax janiw utjkiti.
That was it for me today.	Jichhürojj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
I know what’s going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk yattwa.
He said it all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk arsüna.
Again in big trouble.	Wasitat jach’a jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
I have always seen him.	Nayajj nayratpachaw jupar uñjta.
It doesn't matter who was there.	Uka cheqan khitïnsa ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
He knew everything he did.	Jupajj taqe kunsa luri uk sum yatïna.
And he didn’t know enough about her.	Ukat jupax janiw jupat sum yatkänti.
That didn't work.	Ukajj janiw lurkänti.
They don't know that.	Jupanakajj janiw uk yatipkiti.
Last night has been a long time now.	Qhipa arumax wali jaya pachaw jichhax jikxatasi.
Things can happen, but they don’t.	Kunanakas pasaspa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He had no idea where he was.	Jupajj kawkhans jikjjatasi uk janiw amuykänti.
Very little actually.	Wali jisk’a chiqpachansa.

But they know exactly what happened.	Ukampis kunas pasäna uk sum yatipxi.
And well, that’s just how it was here.	Ukat wali, ukhamakiw akanx utjäna.
He didn’t want to ride in a cab.	Jupax janiw mä taxi ukan sarnaqañ munkänti.
He really wants to talk to you.	Chiqpachansa jumamp parltʼañ muni.
Almost anything goes at that point.	Niya kunas uka pachanx saraski.
But he's still going strong.	Ukampis jupax wali chʼamampiw sarnaqaski.
He could and would do just about anything.	Jupajj niya taqe kunsa luraspänwa ukat luraspänwa.
I did all the wrong things.	Nayaw taqe jan walinak lurayäta.

There’s what you know.	Ukanx kuntix jumax yatkta ukawa.
He never said that.	Janipuniw ukham siskänti.
There was a small space.	Mä jisk’a chiqaw utjäna.
He doesn't understand it well.	Jupajj janiw sum amuykiti.
I would be surprised if there was.	Ukajj utjaspa ukhajja, wal muspharta.

Yeah, that looks great.	Jïsa, ukajj wali sumaw uñtasi.
Surprisingly, it actually worked.	Muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.

He doesn’t exist not now.	Jupax janiw utjkiti janiw jichhax utjkiti.
I am so happy for you guys.	Nayajj jumanakat wal kusista.
He was afraid of himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupajj ajjsaräna.
Almost no one noticed.	Niya janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
There’s nothing wrong with that.	Janiw kuna jan walinak lurañas utjkiti.
I want a drink myself.	Naya pachpaw mä umañ munta.
No one can deny this.	Janiw khitis uka tuqitxa jan chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
What happened to me? 	¿Kunas nayarojj pasäna?
The man didn't want anything.	Uka jaqejj janiw kunsa munkänti.
Not all people are.	Janiw taqpach jaqenakajj utjkiti.
That's what he told me.	Ukham sasaw jupajj sapjjetäna.
He’s doing it all alone.	Jupax sapakiw taqi ukanak luraski.
He didn't want to be left alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak qheparañ munkänti.
This, in my opinion, is just as bad.	Akax, nayatakix ukhamarakiw jan wali.
They have everything you need.	Jupanakajj taqe kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utji.
At the time, he didn't.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukham lurkänti.
He didn't really have a choice.	Jupajj janiw cheqapunit kuna lurañas utjkänti.

She loved him at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, jupar wal munasïna.

He was doing a job.	Jupajj mä trabajo luraskäna.
I really, really want to do that again.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa wasitat ukham lurañ munta.
Almost too much.	Niya sinti jach’a.
It only happened a couple of times.	Mä pä kutikiw ukham pasäna.

John wasn't like that.	Juanajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
And that, of course, is fine.	Ukat ukax, chiqpachansa, walikïskiwa.

But it’s not very effective.	Ukampis janiw sinti askïkiti.

But now it’s! 	¡Ukampis jichhajj!
He thought something might happen.	Kunas pasaspa sasaw amuyäna.

He does whatever he wants.	Jupajj kunjamtï munki ukhamwa luri.
Except when you do that.	Jan ukasti kunapachatï ukham lurapkta ukhaxa.
He could not have done better himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw jukʼamp sum lurkaspänti.
But it is worth the effort.	Ukampis uka lurañajj wali askiwa.
He wants to say the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw sañ munaraki.
There’s less more.	Ukanx juk’akiw juk’ampi.
He really wants to talk about me.	Chiqpachansa nayat parlañ muni.

In this respect, it is fascinating and surprising.	Uka tuqitxa, wali muspharkañawa ukat muspharkañawa.
Where did the time go.	Kawkirus uka pachax saräna.
At the time, he knew the truth.	Uka tiemponjja, kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatïna.

Bone he doesn’t know anything.	Ch’uqi jupax janiw kuns yatkiti.
It’s all good for me, you know.	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
That can do the work.	Ukaw lurañanak luraspa.

And we needed to do something about it.	Ukat uka toqet kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
I didn’t do that.	Nayax janiw uk lurkti.
And then he rolled his eyes.	Ukat ukat jupax nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.

Afterwards, he too .	Uka qhepatjja, jupajj ukhamarakiw .

Well, he doesn’t.	Ukhama, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.

He can do no more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp lurkaspati.
But there aren’t that many of our kind.	Ukampis janiw ukham walja jiwasan kasta jaqinakax utjkiti.
There’s very little light there.	Ukanx wali juk’a qhanaw utji.
They are, after all, very obvious.	Jupanakax, taqi kunat sipansa, wali qhanaw uñjasi.
He could see better now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sumwa uñjäna.

But that is one of them.	Ukampis ukajj ukanakat maynïriwa.

I was the only one who saw him.	Naya sapakiw jupar uñjta.
I mean more than that.	Nayajj jukʼamp sañ muni.
I really like him a lot.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun gustitu.

And as you said.	Ukat kunjamtï jumax siskta ukhama.

It doesn’t matter at this point.	Uka chiqanx janiw kunas wakiskiti.
So he understood it perfectly.	Ukatwa jupajj uk sum amuyäna.
I don't have that problem.	Janiw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjkituti.

He said he had no choice.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkituti sasaw säna.
They don't know everything.	Jupanakajj janiw taqe kun yatipkiti.
He refused to tell her what he had done.	Jupajj janiw kuntï lurkäna uk yatiyañ munkänti.
He did that, it’s amazing.	Jupax ukham luratayna, wali muspharkañawa.
I just can't believe it!.	¡Nayajj janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti!.
I know it’s worth it.	Nayax yattwa ukax wali askiwa.
Honestly, you’ll be better off.	Chiqpachansa, jumax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasïta.
And he’s very happy to be here.	Ukat jupax wali kusisitaw akan jikxatasïna.
It was lonely.	Ukajj sapakiw utjäna.
He didn't know what to do with her.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupat lurañ yatkänti.
Because it is, of course.	Kunatix ukhamawa, chiqpachansa.
He worked really hard at it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet wal chʼamachasïna.
But he doesn't know that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk yatkiti.
He didn't seem to know.	Jupajj janis yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
Tell them something about yourself.	Juma pachpat kunsa jupanakar yatiyañama.
He made his point, then took it up again.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna uk arsüna, ukat wasitatwa uka toqet apsüna.
He’s one of a kind.	Jupax mä kasta jaqiwa.
No one knows what to do with him.	Janiw khitis jupar kun lurañsa yatkiti.
But he did it very well.	Ukampis jupajj wali sumwa uk luräna.

It's not much better.	Janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
But I don't like that.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw ukajj askïkiti.
But that is not the case now.	Ukampis jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he asked the question.	Ukat ukham jisktʼäna.
The husband doesn’t want to.	Chachax janiw munkiti.
Now he knew his true cause.	Jichhajj kunatsa cheqpach jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
He could do nothing here.	Jupajj janiw kuns akan lurkaspänti.
He couldn't say it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ puedkänti.
No one knew what to make of him.	Janiw khitis jupat kun lurañsa yatkänti.
That’s a bit obvious.	Ukax mä juk’a qhanawa.
Never did that, myself.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, naya pachpa.
That felt good, so he repeated it.	Ukaw sum jikjjatasïna, ukatwa wasitat arsüna.
And that is what he is doing now.	Ukat uk jichhajj luraski.
He did it brilliantly.	Jupajj wali sumaw ukanak luräna.
That’s how it ended, you know.	Ukhamaw tukuyäna, jumax yatisktawa.
You always know it’s there.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukan utji uk yatta.
But to his surprise, no one wanted to know about it.	Ukampis wal muspharäna, janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkänti.
But, this is the most surprising thing to me.	Ukampis, akax nayatakix juk’amp muspharkañawa.
That meant another ride.	Ukajj yaqha kayuk sarañ sañ munäna.
Remove the snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I don’t know anything and I’m nobody.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkti ukat janiw khitis ukhamäkti.
He was the man who was so good.	Jupajj uka jaqejj wali suma jaqënwa.
Of course the dinner would be interesting.	Chiqansa uka manq’añax wali askïspawa.
I couldn't imagine what I was expecting.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
She wanted a good husband.	Jupajj mä suma chacharuw munäna.

I am not sure how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum yatkti.
Such a	Ukham mä .
But one of you must go now.	Ukampis jumanakat mayniw jichhajj sarañapa.
He’s been like this for a week.	Jupax mä semanaw ukham jikxatasi.
I always want to go.	Nayax sapa kutiw sarañ munta.
I didn’t want it much for any reason.	Janiw kunatsa walpun munkayätti.
For a while he was afraid to leave his house.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj utapat mistuñ ajjsaräna.
He was shocked now.	Jupajj jichhajj walpun muspharäna.
Someone has to do something.	Maynix kuns lurañapawa.
He happened to be the best for me!.	¡Jupax nayatakix wali sumaw pasäna!.
Let’s see what we do.	Kunsa lurañäni uk uñjañäni.
He was constantly making them better.	Sapa kutiw jupanakar jukʼamp sum luraskäna.
In fact, that is how he felt about himself.	Chiqansa, ukhamwa jupa pachpat amuyasïna.
Everything we do is important.	Taqi kunatix lurapkta ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
No money, see.	Janiw qullqix utjkiti, uñjañäni.
Or that’s the room.	Jan ukax ukax cuarto satawa.
He was silent, or sad.	Jupax amukiw jikxatasïna, jan ukax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I always make this decision.	Nayax sapa kutiw uka amtar puri.
That matters more to you than it does to me.	Ukajj jumatakejj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa, nayat sipansa.
I want to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw lurañ munta.

He knows who he is.	Jupaw khitïnsa uk sum yati.
I guess two or three times a month maybe.	Nayax pä jan ukax kimsa kutiw phaxsinx amuyasta inas.
I know you don’t want to talk about it.	Nayax yattwa jumax janiw uka tuqit parlañ munktati.
I did it myself of course.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta chiqpachansa.
He did it all to her.	Juparux taqpach luratayna.
He lived three weeks.	Jupajj kimsa semanaw jakasïna.
Well, everything was fine.	Ukhama, taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
I’ve seen the work.	Nayax irnaqäw uñjta.
So, he decided to walk.	Ukhama, jupax sarnaqañ amtäna.
You don't have to.	Janiw jumajj utjkiti.
He didn’t want anyone in the house.	Jupax janiw khitirus uka utan munkänti.
He accepted it with great enthusiasm.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw katoqäna.
I guess we'll see about that.	Nayax uka tuqit uñjañäni sasaw amuyta.
Get yourself married to the wedding.	Juma pachpaw casarasiñatak casarasiñatak jikxatasïta.
That decided the issue.	Ukaw uka jan waltʼäw amtawayi.
It just doesn’t matter.	Ukakiw janiw kunäkisa.
I just can't believe it.	Nayajj janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Yes, he thought he was home now.	Jïsa, jichhajj utaparuw sarjjäna sasaw amuyäna.
But there is urgency.	Ukampis jankʼak lurañaw utji.
That’s okay, okay.	Ukax walikïskiwa, walikïskiwa.
That looks really cool.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali sumaw uñtasi.
But you have to do it yourself.	Ukampis juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
I think it’s very common.	Nayatakix ukax wali uñt’atawa.
He, quite frankly, didn’t want to do that.	Jupax, chiqpachapuniw, jan ukham lurañ munkänti.
It won’t be long!.	¡Janiw jaya tiempox utjkaniti!.
I am very happy with him.	Nayax jupat wal kusista.
Of course, there was no reason.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.

No one knew why or how it happened.	Kunatsa ni kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
This year something happened.	Jichha marax mä kunaw utjawayi.
In fact, the current one is even better.	Chiqansa, jichha tiempon utjki ukax jukʼamp sumawa.
Both are good on their own.	Panpachaniw sapa maynix wali askiwa.
Don’t do it again.	Janiw mayampsa uk luramti.
The bad guy is nothing.	Jan wali jaqejj janiw kunäkisa.
He did indeed do it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw luräna.
I saw it a few days ago.	Mä qawqha urunak nayraw uñjta.
He does not know where or when.	Jupajj kawkhansa, kunapachas jikjjatasi uk janiw yatkiti.
They have a thing.	Jupanakax mä kunaw utji.

It looks the same.	Ukhamarakiw uñtasi.

Nothing works better.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurkiti.
He wanted to know where she was.	Jupax kawkhans jikxatasi uk yatiñ munäna.
I understood them early on and loved them dearly.	Jupanakar nayratpach amuyayäta ukat walpun jupanakar munasïna.
It looks very important.	Ukax wali wakiskir uñtatawa.
Now I want to be honest.	Jichhax chiqapar sarnaqañ munta.
Anything less .	Kunas jukʼamp jiskʼa .
Both of these things rarely happen.	Uka pä tuqitxa, jukʼakiw pasaspa.
I wonder where he got them.	Kawkitsa jupanakar apsüna sasaw jisktʼasta.
And then a week.	Ukat ukat mä semana.
He longed to see her before he left.	Janïr sarkasajj jupar uñjañ wal munäna.
Maybe I should go to another party tonight.	Inas jichha arumax yaqha fiestar sarañax wakischispa.
He’s done a lot of bad things.	Jupax walja jan walinak lurawayi.
A little, but not really.	Mä juk’a, ukampis janiw chiqpachansa.
He told her, once.	Jupax juparux sänwa, mä kutix.

But there is something.	Ukampis kunas utji ukawa.
Soft and cool.	Llamp’u ukat thaya.
It didn't feel kind.	Janiw suma chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.

He didn't understand how.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk jan amuyaskänti.
It’s going to be such a great time.	Ukax ukham jach’a pachaw utjani.
He never wanted it to happen in the first place.	Nayrïr kutin janipuniw ukham pasañap munkänti.
It takes such a long time.	Ukham jaya tiempow pasaski.
It may take a week.	Mä semanaw wakisispa.
One day it will all be worth it.	Mä urux taqi kunas wali askïspawa.
And obviously it was.	Ukat qhanaw ukhamänwa.
Build a house you’ll be happy with.	Mä uta luram, jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
But it shouldn't be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañapäkiti.
He doesn't want to do that.	Ukjja janiw lurañ munkiti.
With him I left you one of mine.	Jupampiw jumatak mä nayan jaytawayta.
Kind of a big house.	Mä kasta jach’a uta.
Because he couldn’t live like that.	Kunatix jupax janiw ukham jakañ puedkänti.
He did this once this morning.	Jupax jichha alwax mä kutiw ukham luratayna.
He's just a bad guy.	Jupajj jan walikïskiwa.
It was a wonderful time in every way.	Uka tiempojj taqe toqet wali sumapunïnwa.

You are such a genuine guy.	Jumax ukham chiqpach waynawa.

That's all he told me.	Ukakiw jupajj sitäna.
That’s obviously very, very important.	Ukax qhanaw wali, wali wakiskiriwa.
But it was like yesterday.	Ukampis qharüru ukhamänwa.
Everything was so long ago.	Taqe kunas wali nayrajj ukhamänwa.
This was our year.	Akax jiwasan maraw utjäna.
There are many of them.	Ukanjja, walja ukanakaw utji.
He was doing this almost every night, now.	Jupax niya sapa arumaw ukham luraskäna, jichhax.
What once seemed impossible now seemed possible.	Kunatï nayrajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa, jichhajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
I didn't rush him.	Janiw nayajj jupar jankʼak lurkti.

This is not a trivial matter.	Ukajj janiw mä jukʼa wakiskiti.
I don't know what his problem is.	Janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis jupajj uk yatkti.
He still hasn't done that.	Jupajj jichhakamajj janiw ukham lurkiti.

This is what it’s all about.	Akax kunatix taqi kunas utjki ukawa.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
He sees himself.	Jupa pachpaw uñjasi.
And now for the latter.	Ukat jichhax qhipa tuqitxa.
I see him once a week.	Semanan mä kutiw jupar uñjta.
So, a year, maybe two.	Ukhama, mä mara, inas pä.
How does a guy .	Kunjamsa mä chachajj .
Or the house.	Jan ukax uta.
This time and before.	Aka kutin ukat nayra.
He was very unhappy.	Jupajj wali jan kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.

You never know what’s coming next.	Kunas jutïrin utjani uk janipuniw yatkayätati.

I will never do that again.	Janipuniw mayamps ukham lurkäti.
And I don't like it.	Ukat janiw nayatakejj gustkituti.
I promise we will do that in the future.	Jutïrin ukanak lurañäni sasaw arsuwayta.
And he seemed like a nice guy.	Ukat jupajj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He made things possible.	Jupaw kunanaktï lurañjamäki ukanak luratayna.
I don’t want to leave you here alone.	Janiw nayax sapak akan jaytañ munkti.
Last evening he spent a party with us.	Qhipa jayp’ux mä fiestan nanakamp chikaw sarnaqäna.
This is always the case.	Ukax sapa kutiw ukham uñjasi.
He thought he knew.	Jupax yattwa sasaw amuyäna.
But it almost did.	Ukampis niyaw ukham lurawayi.
I’m going to the police.	Nayax policiaruw sarä.
He says he cares about you.	Jupax jumat llakistwa sasaw saraki.
He reiterated his feelings.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk wasitatwa arsüna.
I grew up here.	Nayax akan jilïr jaqïtwa.
He began to eat with great enthusiasm.	Jupax wali kusisitaw manq’añ qalltäna.
He thought nothing was wrong.	Janiw kunas jan walïkiti sasaw amuyäna.
To be honest, he really never did.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa janipuniw ukham lurkänti.
I don’t think it’s bad.	Nayax janiw jan walïkiti sasaw amuyta.
I can see how excited he is.	Kunjamsa jupajj kusisit jikjjatasi uk sum uñjta.
He loves me, but he doesn't know it.	Jupajj nayaruw munasi, ukampis janiw uk yatkiti.
I want to go somewhere.	Nayax kawkirus sarañ munta.
But it is not available now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj utjkiti.
That’s nobody, of course.	Ukax janiw khitis ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
It happened to me recently.	Jichhakiw nayarojj ukham pasäna.
He died about ten years ago.	Jupajj niya tunka mara nayraw jiwjjäna.
I’ll go there another time.	Nayax yaqha pacharuw uka chiqar sarä.
I mean amazingly bad.	Nayax muspharkañ jan waliw sañ munta.
You had no choice.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Jupajj kunjamtï munkäna ukham luraspänwa.
But someone else did.	Ukampis mayniw ukham luratayna.
He watched the timing.	Jupajj kuna horasas pasaski uk uñjäna.
But the last .	Ukampis qhepa .
There is a real sense of urgency.	Chiqpachansa, jankʼakiw lurañax utji.
He was very hungry.	Jupajj walpun jan manqʼat jikjjatasïna.
And he did it once and for all.	Ukat mä kutikiw ukham luräna.
I think that would be good for you.	Ukax jumatakix wali askïspawa sasaw amuyta.
There’s still something dark about it.	Ukanx wali ch’amaw kunas utji.
He shook her off.	Jupajj jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
Now I can’t say yes.	Jichhax janiw jïsa sañjamäkiti.
He decided to go anyway, alone.	Jupax kunjamatsa sarañ amtäna, sapaki.
It really is better together.	Chiqpachansa, mayachtʼasis jukʼamp askiwa.
It was what he loved about me.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj nayat wal munkäna ukawa.
He had no reason to do it.	Jupajj janiw kuna razonas uk lurkänti.
Now there are two.	Jichhax pä.
He wasn't sure why.	Jupajj kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
You are beautiful, yourself.	Jumax wali sumawa, juma pachpa.
I think the past is good.	Nayax amuyta nayra pachax wali askiwa.
He says he can do anything.	Kunsa luraspa sasaw saraki.
But they are not necessary.	Ukampis janiw jupanakajj wakiskiti.
And, so it goes.	Ukat, ukhamaw saraski.
But that might backfire on him.	Ukampis ukajj inas jupar jan walinak luraspa.
Almost, at least.	Niya, mä juk’a.
He decided to ride here.	Jupax aka chiqar kayuk sarañ amtäna.
But I think it's okay to do it.	Ukampis nayatakejj uk lurañajj walikïskiwa.
There was something there, all right.	Ukanx kunas utjäna, walikïskiwa.
It happened too fast.	Sinti jank’akiw pasäna.
He needed time to do what he needed to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk lurañatakiw tiempo munäna.
Do everything you can.	Taqi kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañamawa.
A lot of rain puri.	Walja jallu puri.

So much blood, so much flesh.	Ukhama walja wila, walja aycha.
That’s immature, maybe.	Ukax jan jilïr jaqiwa, inas.
And no, not everything.	Ukat janiw, janiw taqi kunas utjkiti.
This is not necessary .	Ukax janiw wakiskiti .
He asked the question .	Jupajj akham sasaw jisktʼäna .
Let’s do it in two ways.	Pä tuqit lurañäni.
But it all happened much faster than he did.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp jankʼakiw pasäna.
So far I am very impressed.	Jichhakamax walpun muspharta.
The most important thing is that .	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa, ukax .
But it wasn't what he did.	Ukampis janiw kuntï jupajj lurkäna ukhamäkänti.
The ?.	Ukax ?.
He didn't know if that was enough.	Ukajj wakisispati janicha uk janiw yatkänti.
Whatever you meant to say.	Kuntï jumajj sañ munkta ukjja.
Hence the question.	Ukatwa uka jisktʼajj utji.
Or maybe he should.	Jan ukajj inas jupajj ukham lurañapa.

He wanted to do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk lurañ munäna.
You’re the best person anyone can be.	Jumax khitirus wali suma jaqïtawa.

Something, like, like.	Kunas, ukhama, ukhama.

But he never said it.	Ukampis janipuniw arskänti.
I know you mean well, but .	Nayax yattwa jumax sum sañ munta, ukampis .
But this, he thought.	Ukampis aka, sasaw amuyäna.
Time is of the essence for this.	Ukatakejj tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s all good, though.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa, ukampis.
He died on a very similar day.	Jupajj wali ukham mä uruw jiwjjäna.

Two weeks alone.	Pä semana sapakiw sarnaqäna.
It was wonderful and ultimately wonderful.	Wali sumapunïnwa ukat qhipharux wali sumapunïnwa.
Or a book.	Jan ukajj mä libro.
It was something that stayed.	Ukajj mä kunaw qheparäna.

Remove the snowflakes.	Uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But this isn’t the case, not really.	Ukampis akax janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw chiqpachansa.
But then he was so happy.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
This is hard to avoid and very important.	Ukax jan lurañax ch’amawa ukat wali wakiskiriwa.
I didn’t know how to do this.	Janiw nayax uk lurañ yatkayätti.

He doesn’t know how.	Jupax janiw kunjamsa uk yatkiti.
Surprisingly, not for me.	Muspharkañawa, nayatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
He understood it fairly well.	Jupajj mä jukʼa sumwa uk sum amuyäna.
No one seems to have it.	Janiw khitis uka tuqitxa utjkaspati.
There’s another place there.	Ukanx yaqha chiqaw utji.
This is clearly found here.	Ukajj qhanaw akan jikjjatasi.
He definitely knew her name.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sutip yatïna.
He wanted to behave himself.	Jupa pachpaw sarnaqañ munäna.
I don't want him to do that for me.	Janiw nayatakejj ukham lurañap munkti.
Someone was in the house.	Mayniw uka utapan utjäna.
Then he saw another snowflake.	Ukat yaqha ch’uqi uñjäna.
He died shortly afterwards.	Mä qhawqha tiempo qhepatwa jiwjjäna.

No, you have to do that.	Janiwa, jumajj ukham lurañamawa.

Now he was doing that.	Jichhajj ukham luraskäna.
He has everything.	Jupax taqi kunaw utji.

He knew all about it.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sum yatïna.

When we do that again, that's fine.	Kunapachatï ukham wasitat lurañäni ukhajja, ukajj walikïskiwa.

And now, that’s good for you.	Ukat jichhax, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
She was staring at him in dismay.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Enjoy the season!.	¡Uka pachanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi!.
He has to go there.	Ukaruw sarañapa.
To be honest, I see both.	Chiqpachansa, panpachaniw ukham uñjta.

He told me it would last two weeks.	Pä semanaw ukax utjani sasaw sitäna.
So again, again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa.
But you expect the same rules.	Ukampis jumax pachpa kamachinak suyaskta.
He was always doing something.	Jupax sapa kutiw kuns luraskäna.
He said it was better in the morning.	Jupax alwax juk’amp askiwa sasaw säna.

He spent some time in jail.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow carcelan qheparäna.
He’s completely foreign, you know.	Jupax taqpach yaqha markankir jaqiwa, jumax yatisktawa.
There’s nothing he can do here, really.	Janiw kunas jupax akan lurkaspati, chiqpachansa.
He did an amazing job.	Jupajj wali muspharkañ luräna.

Very large.	Sinti jach’a.

I’m afraid they don’t exist.	Nayax axsaratwa jupanakax janiw utjkiti.
Or he should do it.	Jan ukajj lurañapawa.
I usually agree with him on that.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw uka toqet mä amtar puriñ yatta.

You’re going to create new things.	Jumax machaq yänak lurañ amtasta.

But there is such a thing.	Ukampis ukham mä kunaw utji.
Do you really think that is possible.	¿Chiqapunit ukham lurañax wakisispa sasin amuyta.
That doesn't mean it doesn't.	Ukajj janiw sañ munkiti, janiw uk sañ munkiti.
There was no time for that.	Ukatakejj janiw uka tiempojj utjkänti.
And that's pretty cool.	Ukat ukajj wali sumawa.
Someone almost rolled his eyes.	Maynix niyaw nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.

It happened about a week ago.	Niya mä semana nayraw ukham pasäna.
I am not sure how he feels about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunjamsa jikxatasi uk janiw sum yatkti.
You can’t do it tomorrow.	Qhipürux janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Someone told him.	Mayniw jupar säna.
Somehow he wanted her that much more.	Kunjamatsa juparux ukham juk’amp munäna.
Christmas is coming early!.	¡Navidad ukax wali alwat purini!.
He must have been curious.	Jupajj yatiñwa munpachäna.
He barely spoke to anyone.	Jupajj jukʼakiw khitimpis parläna.
That is what we need to do today.	Jichhürunakanx ukham lurañaw wakisi.
It’s completely silent.	Ukax taqpach amukiw.
But nothing isn’t good enough.	Ukampis janiw kunas jan askïkiti.
So it's very recent.	Ukhamajj wali jichhakiw utji.
It was a one-off.	Ukajj mä sapa kutikiw utjäna.
I’ve been very careful.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw arsuwayta.
I prefer this one.	Nayax akax juk’amp askiwa.
I won’t do it again.	Janiw mayampsa lurkäti.
It’s still kind of weird.	Wali kasta muspharkañawa.
He wanted to live as well.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw jakañ wal munäna.
I love this from him.	Nayax jupat akax walpun munasta.
I think that’s pretty bad.	Nayax ukax wali jan waliw sasaw amuyta.
But there was no one inside.	Ukampis janiw khitis uka manqhan utjkänti.
How to .	Kunjamsa .
What a beer.	Kunas mä cerveza.
Well, it doesn’t happen to me.	Ukhama, nayatakix janiw ukhamäkiti.
He already knew that.	Ukhamwa jupajj nayratpach yatïna.
Don't know what's going on.	Janiw yatkiti kunas utji.
The next day it wasn’t.	Qhipürux janiw ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to use it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak apnaqañ munkänti.
I was lonely and sad.	Nayax sapakiw jikxatasiyäta ukat llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I think of something and he says.	Nayax kuns amuyta ukat jupax siwa.
No one ever does anything wrong.	Janiw khitis kunapachas jan walinak lurkiti.
I’m going to go there.	Nayax ukaruw saraskta.
There I am alone.	Ukanjja, sapakiw jikjjatasta.
It was a great day.	Mä jach’a uru ukhamänwa.
So there will be no such thing.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurañajj utjkaniti.
Didn’t really need to do that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
Where is all this money going?.	¿Kawkirus taqi aka qullqix saraski?.
I liked it a lot.	Ukajj wal gustitu.
He said he wouldn't.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkäti sasaw säna.
I don't think so now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham amuykti.
He would make a delicious meal for some reason.	Jupajj kunatsa mä suma manqʼa luraspa.
It was a school day, after all.	Yatiqañ uruw uka urux utjäna, taqi kunat sipansa.
I've done my best.	Nayax taqi ch'amampiw lurawayta.
He studied it for a year.	Jupajj mä maraw uk yateqäna.
I didn’t have the money to do it properly.	Uk sum lurañatakix janiw qullqix utjkitänti.
This is something I never expected.	Ukajj janipuniw suykayätti.
Me, too, like that.	Naya, ukhamaraki, ukhama.
Now let’s make this more similar.	Jichhax akax juk’amp uñtasit lurañäni.
I’m in love with them.	Nayax munasiñampiw jupanakar uñjta.
Therefore, it is necessary to do bad things.	Ukatwa jan walinak lurañax wakisi.
I know you guys don't like me.	Nayajj yattwa, jumanakajj janiw nayar gustkituti.
The guy knew that.	Uka waynax uk yatïna.
It’s not the way it should be.	Janiw kunjamtï lurañapäki ukhamäkiti.
It’s so beautiful.	Ukhama sumawa.
I better hurry up, he thought.	Nayajj jankʼakiw uk lurañajj jukʼamp askejja, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
But there was never anything like that.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham kunas utjkänti.
That's fine, that's fine.	Ukajj walikïskiwa, ukajj walikïskiwa.
But there was nothing like that.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.
You are the first to do so.	Jumaw nayrïr kutix ukham lurasma.
Before, During and After .	Janïr, uka tiempon ukat uka qhepatjja .
I have promised everything.	Nayajj taqe kunwa arsuwayta.
I don’t want or need all that.	Janiw taqi ukanak munkti ni munkti.
I like them even more now.	Jichhajj jupanakajj jukʼampiw gustitu.
After all, it’s summer time.	Taqi kunat sipansa, verano pachaw purini.
But I can't remember where.	Ukampis kawkhansa uk janiw amtaskti.
Not yet, he thought.	Janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkiti, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
Not after what he had been through.	Janiw kunanaktï jupajj paskäna uka qhepatjja.
But then that wasn't necessary.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskänti.
Now he feels like a real person.	Jichhajj cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukhamaw jikjjatasi.
It’s a little something.	Mä jisk’a kuna.
I’m sure you remember.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jumax amtaskta.
I decided to talk about it later.	Qhipürux uka tuqit parltʼañ amtawayta.
There wasn’t much more to do, after all.	Janiw juk’amp lurañax utjkänti, taqi kunat sipansa.
After that, he concentrated on eating breakfast.	Uka qhepatjja, desayuno manqʼañatakejj taqe chuymaw chuym churäna.
But that can take years.	Ukampis ukatakix walja maranakaw munasispa.
They are all important.	Taqi jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
You gave me life.	Jumaw jakañ churitu.
He didn't want to stay.	Jupajj janiw qheparañ munkänti.
You have to do the best you can about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali sum lurañamawa.
I gave blood today.	Jichhüruw wila churta.
I understand why it started for you.	Kunatsa jumatakejj ukajj qalltäna uk sum amuyta.
Yes,’ he replied.	Jïsa’ sasaw jupajj säna.
I love making them.	Nayax jupanakar lurañax walpun munta.
Both should do the same thing.	Panpachaniw pachpa lurañapa.
You should never do this.	Janipuniw uk lurañamäkiti.
So yeah, you know that.	Ukhamajj jïsa, jumajj uk yatisktawa.
This is a woman who.	Akax mä warmiwa khititix.
I wonder how long it will last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani sasaw jisktʼasta.
Or, nothing at all.	Jan ukax, janiw kunas utjkiti.
But he seemed nice.	Ukampis jupajj suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He pulled for it once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw ukatakejj jaqontäna.
Maybe you can eat ten.	Inas tunka manq’añax wakischispa.
We have to do it again for a while.	Mä juk’a pachaw wasitat lurañasa.
I feel like this, now.	Nayax akax akham sasaw amuyasta, jichhax.
He wanted her yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jupar munäna.
That’s not good enough for it.	Ukax janiw ukatakix askïkiti.
He knew what was wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk sum yatïna.
But now that seems impossible.	Ukampis jichhajj ukajj janis lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
Now the other one.	Jichhax maynix.
I think it was what was nice about him.	Nayax amuyta kunatix jupat wali sumapunïnwa.
Every time he was in the house, of course.	Sapa kutiw jupax uka utapan jikxatasïna, chiqpachansa.
And the man .	Ukat uka jaqejj .
There really is no reason for all this.	Chiqansa janiw kuna razonas taqi ukanak lurañatakix utjkiti.
By now it was pretty obvious.	Jichhakamax wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
He stayed a quarter of an hour.	Jupajj mä cuarto horaw qheparäna.
It took longer to realize.	Ukajj jukʼamp jaya tiempow amuyasïna.
Of course, he already knew how.	Chiqansa, kunjamsa uk jupax nayratpach yatïna.
Of course I don’t want that.	Chiqansa janiw nayax uk munkti.
He didn't care who he was.	Jupajj khitïnsa uk janiw kuns lurkänti.
I don’t think that’s good enough.	Ukax janiw askïkiti sasaw amuyasta.
It should do what you want it to do.	Ukaw kuntï munkta uk lurañapa.
I wanted to know about it before.	Nayax nayrax uka tuqit yatiñ munta.
But most of all, it was how he saw it all.	Ukampis taqe kunat sipansa, kunjamsa jupajj taqe kunsa uñjäna ukawa.
He doesn't always like it.	Jupajj janiw sapa kuti ukham gustkiti.
There’s something in there.	Kuna kunas uka manqhan utji.
And that was pretty much everything.	Ukat ukajj niya taqe kunaw utjäna.
He struck once, hard.	Jupax mä kutiw ch’allt’äna, wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
But this is a wrong question.	Ukampis aka jisktʼajj janiw walïkiti.
He was alone in the house.	Jupajj sapakiw uka utan jikjjatasïna.
But I definitely need to do it.	Ukampis nayax chiqpachapuniw ukanak lurañax wakisi.
But there was no time for that now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukatakejj tiempojj utjkänti.
He was quite happy for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempojj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
And lots of potatoes.	Ukat walja ch’uqi.
He’ll say yes once, no twice.	Jupax mä kutiw jïsa sañ muni, pä kutiw janiw sañ muni.
I’m the same way.	Nayax ukhamarakiw.
But he made the effort to attend.	Ukampis uka tantachäwir sarañatakiw wal chʼamachasïna.
I will have to do that .	Nayajj ukham lurañaw wakisini .
She spoke to him quietly and warmly.	Jupajj amukiw ukat wali munasiñampiw jupar arsüna.
You have to make yourself feel bad.	Juma pachpaw jan walinak lurasajj jan walinak lurañama.
I went as well.	Nayax ukhamarakiw sarawayta.
There is also a nice restaurant in the area.	Ukhamarakiw mä suma manq’añ utax uka chiqanx utji.
They are not much needed.	Jupanakajj janiw sinti munaskiti.
He knew exactly where he wanted to go.	Kawkirus sarañ munäna uk sum yatïna.
I really enjoyed this place.	Chiqpachansa aka chiqanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I don’t want to live like that.	Janiw nayax ukham jakañ munkti.
I wanted to see him that very night.	Uka pachpa arumaw jupar uñjañ munta.
He sucked it up.	Jupax uka chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
And I have always done that.	Ukat nayratpachaw ukham lurawayta.
He doesn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj munaskiti.
And that doesn’t really matter.	Ukat ukax janiw chiqpachansa wakiskiti.
Honestly, you’re right.	Chiqpachansa, jumax chiqpachapuniw sista.
Let me know what happens.	Kunas pasaspa uk yatiyapxita.
It didn’t matter what time of the night it was.	Uka arumax kuna horasas utjäna ukax janiw kunäkisa.
I feel sorry for you.	Nayax jumanakat sinti llakistwa.
Very loud, very cold.	Wali jach’a, wali thaya.
You can find a little bit of everything here.	Aka chiqanx mä juk’a taqi kunaw jikxatasi.
He really didn't know what was going to happen to them.	Chiqpachansa, kunas jupanakar pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
He told me that.	Jupajj ukham sitäna.
He knew it was.	Jupajj uk yatïna.
He couldn't say yes or no.	Jupajj janiw jïsa jan ukajj janiw sañ puedkänti.
He was completely different.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa yaqha jaqënwa.
I didn’t see him.	Juparux janiw uñjkti.
I am not like that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkti.
And you’re beautiful, too.	Ukat jumax wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
He will get there.	Jupajj ukaruw purini.
¡We should do the same!.	¡Jiwasax ukhamarakiw lurañasa!.
That’s how everything happened.	Ukhamaw taqi kunas pasäna.
And here it was the quietest of the night.	Ukat akanx arumax juk’amp amukiw utjäna.
He wants to live a long time.	Jupax jaya pachaw jakañ muni.
It's really hard not to.	Chiqpachansa jan lurañax chʼamakiwa.
Now I feel that’s okay.	Jichhax ukax walikïskiwa sasaw amuyasta.
You're welcome to eat with us.	Jumax nanakamp chika manq'añax wali askiwa.
I don’t know exactly where.	Janiw kawkirus sum yatkti.
She asked him what he wanted to happen.	Ukat kunas pasañap munta sasaw jisktʼäna.
You know, you just, I can’t do this anymore.	Jumax yatisktawa, jumax ukhamakiw, janiw juk’amp akax lurañjamäkiti.
Everyone knows what these are.	Ukanakax kunas uk taqiniw yatipxi.
He needs to go less a day than you.	Jupajj jumat sipansa jukʼamp jan mä uruw sarañapa.
What happens tomorrow.	Kunas qharürojj pasani.
He seemed to genuinely want to help her.	Chiqpachansa jupar yanaptʼañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
I love him, yeah.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta, jïsa.
No one really knew anything about it .	Janiw khitis uka tuqitxa chiqpachapuni kuns yatkänti .
That’s why he watches it.	Ukatwa uk uñji.
I hope he’s right.	Nayax jupax chiqaw sasaw suyt’askta.
Until the little snowflakes.	Jisk’a jisk’a ch’uqi.
This was a good decade ago.	Akax mä suma tunka maraw nayrax utjawayi.
The guy just said that.	Uka waynax ukhamakiw säna.
I don't care who did it.	Khitis uk luräna uk janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkti.
That would be really interesting.	Ukajj cheqapuniw wali askïspa.
That was not needed now.	Ukajj janiw jichhajj wakiskänti.
He died three days ago.	Jupajj kimsa uru nayraw jiwjjäna.
Or maybe .	Jan ukasti inas .
Almost no one was there, ever.	Niya janiw khitis ukan utjkänti, janipuniw.
It’s going to be another hot day.	Yaqha junt’u uruw utjani.
I have no idea what that meant.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munkäna uk janiw amuykti.
But it often feels like it.	Ukampis walja kutiw ukham amuyasi.
Soft and smooth.	Llamp’u ukat ch’uqi.
But nobody wanted them.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupanakar munkänti.
He wants something from me.	Jupax nayat kuns muni.
I’m really not sure.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jan sum yatkti.
So they were really the first problem.	Ukhamajj jupanakajj cheqapuniw nayrïr jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.
One day he might do that.	Mä urux jupax ukham luraspa.
You can’t do what you want.	Janiw kuntï munkta uk lurañjamäkiti.
It’s what it isn’t.	Ukax kunatix jan ukhamäki ukawa.
Now the day has arrived.	Jichhajj uruw purini.
The man was right about that.	Uka jaqejj cheqapuniw ukanak arsüna.
There is no problem getting there.	Ukar puriñkamax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He doesn't want to talk to anyone.	Janiw khitimpis parlañ munkiti.
I wonder why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna sasaw jisktʼasta.
Hot, you know.	Junt’u, jumax yatisktawa.
I’m going to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ amtaskta.
Let’s see if you can do something for him.	Jupatak kuns lurasmati janicha uk uñjañäni.
It should be done quickly.	Jank’akiw lurañapa.
They were available all day.	Jupanakajj taqe uruw utjäna.
What you can do every day is better.	Kuntï sapa uru lurañjamäki ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
It’s raining hard.	Ukax jallux wali ch’amawa.
This requires careful consideration.	Ukatakejj wali amuyumpiw lurañasa.
You will find yourself again.	Jumax wasitatwa juma pachpa jikxatasïta.
Let’s see how he does it.	Kunjamsa luri uk uñjañäni.
And he did it again himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw wasitat luräna.
I thought it did.	Nayax ukham luri sasaw amuyayäta.
Very quickly though.	Wali jank’akiw ukhama.
I know myself better now.	Jichhajj naya pachpat jukʼamp sum yatta.
More and more every day.	Sapa uru juk’ampi juk’ampi.
It needed more time.	Jukʼamp tiempow munasïna.
You can do better.	Jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
So let’s take a look at that.	Ukhamajj uk uñjañäni.
I hope it’s clear now.	Jichhax qhanaw sasaw suyt’askta.
There’s something better out there.	Ukanx juk’amp sumaw utji.
People don’t know who he was, not really.	Jaqinakax janiw khitïnsa uk yatipkiti, janiw chiqpachapunix yatipkiti.
There’s no time to do it.	Janiw kuna pachas lurañax utjkiti.
I came to the scene immediately.	Nayajj jankʼakiw uka cheqar jutta.
And he is, lovely man.	Ukat jupax, munat jaqiwa.
I don't remember that well now.	Jichhajj janiw uk sum amtaskti.
But it is worth doing.	Ukampis lurañajj wali askiwa.
The breakfast is excellent.	Uka desayuno ukaxa wali sumawa.
There aren’t many people there.	Ukanx janiw walja jaqinakax utjkiti.
He has to do it.	Jupajj lurañapawa.
It was like this for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham utjäna.
He was barely looking at them.	Jupajj jukʼakiw jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
On the contrary, this is not the case.	Jan ukasti, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
He’s still in bed.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw ikiñan jikxatasi.
Because, there is nothing to do here.	Kunatix, janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
He used to be a good man.	Nayrajj wali suma jaqënwa.
Anything from all of this, perhaps.	Taqi ukanakat kunas, inas.
Not sincerely, but awesome.	Janiw taqi chuyma, jan ukasti wali muspharkañawa.
There are no people talking about it.	Janiw uka toqet parlir jaqenakajj utjkiti.
Let’s do whatever you want.	Kuntï munkta uk lurañäni.
It ended up being impossible.	Ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw tukuyäna.
He wanted to spend the night with her.	Jupampiw uka arumax qhiparañ munäna.
And he knew it was only once.	Ukat mä kutikiw utjäna, uk sum yatïna.
Except another and another and another.	Jan ukasti yaqha ukat yaqha ukat yaqha ukanakaw utji.
Three days later he died alone.	Kimsa uru qhepatjja sapakiw jiwjjäna.
But he did nothing to achieve this goal.	Ukampis uka amtar puriñkamax janiw kuns lurkänti.
I thought everything was wrong.	Taqi kunas jan waliw sasaw amuyayäta.
It is best to act quickly.	Jankʼak lurañaw wali askejja.
I’m better here.	Nayax akanx juk’amp askiwa.
He thought there was nothing wrong with it.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti sasaw amuyäna.
But it is not the .	Ukampis janiw uka .
That’s what came to me.	Ukaw nayar jutäna.
We’ll see soon enough.	Jiwasax jank’akiw uñjañäni.
I asked him why he thought that.	Kunatsa ukham amuyi sasaw jisktʼta.
It's so beautiful	Ukhama suma .
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Jïsa, ukax wali askiwa.
Well this is it.	Suma akax ukhamawa.
I don’t do that very often.	Nayax janiw sinti sapa kuti ukham lurkti.
You guys are all welcome, thank you very much.	Jumanakax taqi kunas wali askiwa, walpun yuspärta.
I want to stay here for the night.	Nayax akan arumax qhiparañ munta.
But otherwise he was.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa jupax ukhamänwa.
He doesn't want one.	Jupajj janiw mä jukʼa munkiti.
How it was everywhere.	Kunjamsa taqe cheqan utjäna.
Actually, do it.	Chiqpachansa, uk luram.
It was, several times.	Ukhamänwa, walja kutiw ukham luräna.
No one did that to him.	Janiw khitis jupar ukham lurkänti.
That was nothing to do.	Ukajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
It wasn't like that for so long.	Ukham jaya tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
So I see the same thing over and over again.	Ukhamajj sapa kutiw pachpa yänak uñjta.
But he took the drive.	Ukampis jupaw uka auto apnaqañ qalltäna.
That’s how he uses it.	Ukhamaw jupax apnaqi.
No one asked questions.	Janiw khitis jisktʼanak lurkänti.
He’s not like he used to be.	Jupax janiw nayrax ukhamäkiti.
Today, he is one of them.	Jichhürunakanjja, jupajj maynïriwa.
And of course everyone knows it.	Ukat chiqpachansa taqiniw uk yatipxi.
There are some kind of things to do.	Kuna kasta lurañas utji.
You are innovative.	Jumax machaq lurañanak lurañ yatta.
So and so and so.	Ukhama ukat ukhama.
Gave him a good job.	Mä suma irnaqäw churäna.
He said the same thing about you once.	Jupajj mä kutikiw jumat pachpa arsüna.
And then we don’t care.	Ukat ukat jiwasax janiw kunäkisa.
People will always need it.	Jaqinakax sapa kutiw munasini.
You know you have to.	Jumax yatisktawa ukham lurañama.
I worked hard every day.	Sapa uruw wal chʼamachasiyäta.
She eventually phoned the police.	Qhepatjja, policiaruw telefonot jawsäna.
Ten years, more.	Tunka mara, juk’ampi.
This time it was the first time for me.	Aka kutix nayrïr kutiw nayatakix ukham lurawayta.
This person is not needed here.	Aka jaqix janiw akan munaskiti.
He died a long time ago.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow jiwjjäna.
But don't do that.	Ukampis jan uk luramti.
So yeah, that's pretty obvious.	Ukhamajj jïsa, ukajj wali qhanawa.
The question has always been there.	Uka jisktʼajj nayratpachaw utjäna.
Anyone can do that with you.	Khitis jumamp chika ukham luraspa.
He’s doing great.	Jupax wali suma luraski.
I love how quick it is.	Nayax kunjams jank’ak luraski ukx walpun munasta.
That was all that was needed.	Ukaw taqe kunatï wakisïna.
But he spoke more forcefully.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp chʼamampiw parläna.
I’m feeling pretty good now.	Jichhax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
It wasn’t at breakfast.	Ukax janiw desayuno ukan utjkänti.
But it just happened.	Ukampis ukhamakiw pasäna.
It did it again.	Ukax wasitat lurawayi.
I’ve seen it myself.	Naya pachpaw uñjta.
The necessary moment has arrived.	Uka wakiskir pachaw purinïna.
Turns out, that’s pretty cool.	Ukhamaw jikxatasi, ukax wali sumawa.
He came to see me a few days ago.	Mä qawqha urunak nayraw nayar uñjir jutäna.
He agreed it was very unusual.	Jupax wali jan uñt’atawa sasaw iyaw säna.
I asked her not to.	Nayajj jan ukham lurañapatakiw mayïna.
There was nothing he could do.	Janiw kunas jupajj lurkänti.
He told me where and when.	Jupaw kawkhansa ukat kunapachas sitäna.
These are the best of the day.	Ukanakax urux wali askiwa.
She knew he didn't know.	Jupajj janiw uk yatkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I really like her and she is a great woman.	Chiqpachansa juparux walpun munasta ukat jupax wali jach’a warmiwa.
He knew immediately what was wrong.	Kunas jan walïki uk jankʼakiw yatïna.
And I think he feels the same way.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasi sasaw amuyta.
Tonight he needed it.	Jichha arumax jupax munasïna.
And summer is beautiful.	Ukat verano ukax wali sumawa.
Great great sum.	Jach’a jach’a suma.
Tonight is very important to me.	Jichha arumax nayatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
Of course, everything else wasn’t.	Chiqansa, taqi kunas janiw ukhamäkänti.
Then he started doing it a bit.	Ukat mä jukʼa lurañ qalltäna.
But fortunately, it’s not good anywhere.	Ukampis wali askiwa, janiw kawkirus askïkiti.
It started the day before.	Ukajj nayrïr uruw qalltäna.
Now, he’s really in trouble here.	Jichhax, chiqpachapuniw jupax akanx jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
I didn’t know about anything .	Nayax janiw kuna tuqitsa yatkayätti .
We need to act quickly.	Ukatakejj jankʼakiw kuns lurañasa.
But I don’t know what to do.	Ukampis janiw kun lurañsa yatkti.
Don’t do everything alone.	Janiw sapakix taqi kuns lurañamäkiti.
I said it was amazing in one respect.	Mä tuqitxa wali muspharkañawa sasaw sista.
He already knew enough about her.	Jupajj niyaw jupat sum yatïna.
I want to know what he has to say.	Kuntï jupajj siski uk yatiñ munta.
Well that’s good enough.	Suma ukax wali askiwa.
Only I can do better here.	Naya sapakiw akan jukʼamp sum lurasmati.
If you want to say this.	Jumatix aka tuqit sañ munsta ukhaxa.
He is more than .	Jupax juk'ampi .
He goes to two people.	Jupax pä jaqiruw sarxi.
There, he was right.	Ukanjja, cheqapuniw jupajj säna.
It was the best thing that ever happened to her.	Ukajj kunatï jupar paskäna ukanakat wali sumapunïnwa.
It would be nice to do something new, but it’s not.	Machaq lurañax wali askïspawa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He said it was very difficult.	Jupax wali ch’amawa sasaw säna.
I’ve never had that chance.	Nayax janipuniw uka ch’am jikxatkti.
To be honest, he doesn’t.	Chiqpachansa, jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
I don’t know of anything that would do that, nowadays.	Janiw kunas ukham lurañapatak yatkti, jichhürunakanxa.
He already knew.	Jupax nayratpach yatïna.
There’s nothing there for me.	Janiw kunas ukan nayatakix utjkiti.
And he didn't know why.	Ukat kunatsa uk janiw yatkänti.
This is rarer, but it can happen as well.	Ukajj jukʼamp jan waliw uñjasi, ukampis ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
You are such a beautiful person.	Jumax ukham suma jaqiwa.
Something is very wrong here.	Kunas wali jan waliw akan utji.
He didn't refuse.	Jupajj janiw jan iyaw siskänti.
Now I want to do something else.	Jichhax yaqha lurañ munta.
He was already in bed.	Jupajj niyaw ikiñan ikiskäna.
So if there is a problem, it doesn't matter.	Ukhamajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa ukhajja, janiw kunäkisa.
Or no one will do it.	Jan ukajj janiw khitis uk lurkaniti.
We will see that soon.	Uk jankʼakiw uñjañäni.
You know all the basics.	Jumax taqi kunatix wakiski ukanak yatta.
No, it's obvious.	Janiwa, qhanawa.
It was, he thought.	Ukhamänwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I hope to do so.	Ukham lurañatakiw suytʼaskta.
No, this was the case.	Janiwa, akax ukhamänwa.
It meant only one thing.	Ukajj mä sapak sañ munäna.
But then I had to do it.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, uk lurañaw wakisïna.
No, he realized.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyasïna.
He wanted an exit.	Jupajj mä mistuñ munäna.
What do you think?.	¿Kunsa jumax amuyta?.
It’s something that needs to be done.	Ukax mä kunaw lurañapa.
No reason, he told himself.	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti, sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
Maybe you can do something about him.	Inas jupat kuns lurasma.
When he reached her, he spoke immediately.	Jupar purisajj jankʼakiw parläna.
But let’s have a party.	Ukampis mä fiesta lurañäni.
He cares how he sees himself.	Kunjamsa jupa pachpa uñji uk sum uñji.
A little more maybe.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi inas.
Slightly slice the stalk of the stalk.	Mä juk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I’ve done it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak lurawayta.
Everyone needs money.	Taqinipuniw qullqix munasispa.
That’s what I call an outdoor party.	Ukax nayatakix anqan fiesta satawa.
So maybe .	Ukhamajj inas .
There is a light in the area.	Uka chiqanx mä qhanaw utji.
I’m saying that, yes.	Nayax ukham sista, jïsa.
You look a little short.	Jumax mä juk’a jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
Let's see if that works first.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk nayraqat uñjañäni.
Something different for me.	Kunas nayatakix yaqha ukhama.
He said that it was all right.	Ukajj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
I feel the same good and the same bad.	Nayax pachpa suma ukat pachpa jan waliw jikxatastxa.
He was eager to forgive.	Jupajj perdón churañ wal munäna.
And you can’t do that.	Ukat janiw uk lurañjamäkiti.
How long has he been waiting for this.	Qhawqha pachas jupax aka suyt’aski.
So, everything is fine now.	Ukhama, jichhax taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
This is not a .	Ukajj janiw mä .
But so could anyone.	Ukampis khitis ukhamarakiw luraspäna.
This, of course, is not necessary.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, janiw wakiskiti.
I’ll leave it to you.	Nayax jumaruw jaytawayta.
Let us know in advance.	Nayratpach yatiyapjjeta.
What can be done seems impossible.	Kuntï lurañjamäki ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
Today we will do the last one.	Jichhüruw qhip qhipa lurañäni.
I promised to go.	Nayax sarañ arsuwayta.
No, I don't do that.	Janiwa, janiw nayajj ukham lurkti.
I want to be in love.	Nayax munasiñampiw sarnaqañ munta.
I want more .	Nayax juk'amp munta .
That was the only thing that existed before.	Ukakiw nayrajj utjäna.
I'm hungry here.	Nayax akan manq'at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
What he needs is irrelevant.	Kuntï jupajj wakiski ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
So he did it.	Ukatwa uk luräna.
But of course he’s real.	Ukampis chiqpachansa jupax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
And it’s not the right thing to do.	Ukat janiw ukax askïkiti.
This time slower and in worse weather.	Aka kutix juk’amp llamp’u ukat juk’amp jan wali pachan.
I want to take some.	Mä juk’a apsuñ munta.
He wanted a cigarette.	Jupajj mä cigarro munäna.
I made good on that.	Nayajj uka toqet sumwa lurayäta.
I don't know where that came from.	Ukajj kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw yatkti.
This was a rather strange feeling.	Ukajj mä jukʼa muspharkañ jikjjatasïna.
They ultimately work for me.	Jupanakax qhipharux nayatakix wali askiwa.
Make yourself some coffee.	Juma pachpaw mä juk’a café lurañama.
He expected it to be so.	Jupajj ukhamwa suyäna.
Everything feels ugly and uncomfortable.	Taqi kunas jan wali ukat jan waliw jikxatasi.
What a great film.	Kunjams mä jach’a película.
To my surprise, he offered to do so.	Ukatwa ukham lurä sasaw sitäna, ukajj wal muspharta.
More here, here, and here.	Juk’ampi akan, akan, ukat akan.
But there is a less serious way to do it.	Ukampis jan sinti jan walinak lurañaw utji.
No one will have me.	Janiw khitis nayar utjkaniti.
I just came from the country.	Jichhakiw uka markat jutta.
This takes a long time.	Ukatakejj walja tiempow ukham lurañajj wakisi.
He knew exactly where and when.	Kawkhansa ukat kunapachas uk sum yatïna.
He could do a better job in the morning.	Jupajj alwajj jukʼamp sum lurañwa luraspäna.
Or that little one.	Jan ukax uka jisk’a.
Of course it is .	Chiqansa ukax .
We have three weeks.	Kimsa semanaw utjistu.
It doesn't love me anymore.	Janiw nayar jukʼamp munaskiti.
It can be useful or useful.	Ukajj wali askïspawa jan ukajj wali askïspawa.
And he refused to give permission.	Ukat janiw permiso churañ munkänti.
Everything was like that.	Taqi kunas ukhamänwa.
There was nothing in the past.	Nayra pachanx janiw kunas utjkänti.
Then came the fateful day.	Ukat uka jan wali uruw purinïna.
It couldn’t be a higher price.	Janiw juk’amp jach’a qullqix utjkaspati.
You have everything you need in the modern world.	Jichha pachanx taqi kunatix utjki ukanakaw utji.
I can't say any more.	Janiw jukʼamp sañjamäkiti.
That’s really the point here.	Ukaw aka chiqanx chiqpachapunix uka tuqitxa.
I said the wrong thing.	Nayax jan wali arunak arsuwayta.
Here's what it says:	Aka chiqanx akham siwa:
I promised to make them breakfast.	Jupanakar desayuno lurañaw sasaw arsuwayta.
We have nothing to do with it.	Jiwasax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I hope something comes of it.	Nayax suyt’twa kunas ukat jutani.
The weather is clear, the night will be fine.	Pachax wali qhanawa, arumax wali sumaw utjani.
He was a very secretive man.	Jupajj wali jamasat jaqënwa.
So very slow as well.	Ukhama wali llamp’u ukhamaraki.
But you, once they .	Ukampis jumax, mä kutix jupanakax .
He longed to see her.	Jupajj jupar uñjañ wal munäna.
Each .	Sapa .
I’m a stranger here.	Nayax akanx mä jan uñt’at jaqïtwa.
I think you know that about me.	Nayax amuyta, jumax nayat uk yatisktawa.
A different place.	Mä yaqha chiqa.
I would never do it again, ever.	Nayax janipuniw mayamps uk lurañ munkti, janipuniw.
It’s been a real good day.	Chiqpach suma uruw utjawayi.
I can’t do anything right.	Janiw kuns sum lurirjamäkti.
More about learning.	Yatiqañ tuqit juk’ampi.
I just heard about it.	Jichhakiw uk istʼta.
Not the people for that matter.	Janiw jaqinakax uka tuqitxa.
He’s already waiting.	Jupax niyaw suyt’aski.
This required a new approach.	Ukatakejj mä machaq lurañaw wakisïna.
I hope so this year.	Jichha marax ukhamarakiw suyt’ta.
You have to do this in advance.	Ukxa nayratpach lurañamawa.
I agree with that.	Nayax ukax iyaw satawa.
In fact, he felt unworthy.	Chiqansa, jan askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
And it was all wonderful.	Ukat taqe ukanakajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He threw himself at her every time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw jupar jaqontäna.
He had just decided.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk amtäna.
He’s so nice, he’s so attentive.	Jupax wali sumawa, wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
He wants to learn.	Yatiqañ muni.
Nothing else made sense.	Janiw kunas yaqha tuqitxa amuyaskänti.
In fact .	Chiqansa .
If you want to come along.	Jumatix jutañ munsta ukhaxa.
But now it was a long time or needed.	Ukampis jichhajj walja tiempow jan ukajj wakiskänti.
Do it for me.	Nayatakix uk luram.
So he worked hard.	Ukatwa jupajj wal chʼamachasïna.
Beyond that, he couldn't tell what was going to happen.	Ukat sipansa, janiw kunas pasani uk yatiñ puedkänti.
And he did it himself.	Ukat jupaw uk luräna.
That or any kind.	Uka jan ukax kuna kasta.
It doesn’t take long in this country.	Aka markanx janiw jaya pachax munaskiti.
Or somehow he thought so.	Jan ukajj kunjamatsa ukham amuyäna.
Instead, he threw it.	Jan ukasti, jupajj ukaruw jaqontäna.
I definitely have.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw utjitu.
The cross is the cross is the cross.	Ch’iqa ch’iqa ch’iqa ch’iqa.
And all this takes three years.	Ukat taqi ukanakax kimsa maraw munasispa.
But maybe there is something.	Ukampis inas kunas utjaspa.
So much the better, anyhow.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa, kunjamatsa.
Now everyone knows everything.	Jichhax taqiniw taqi kun yatipxi.
They were very important.	Wali wali wakiskiriwa.
I just didn't want to know any more.	Nayajj janiw jukʼamp yatiñ munkayätti.
But he knew he would.	Ukampis ukham lurani uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He loves old things.	Jupax nayra yänak wal munasi.
He’s in a safe place now.	Jupax jichhax mä jan kuna jan walt’äwin jikxatasi.
But it doesn't take long to do so.	Ukampis uk lurañatakix janiw walja tiempox munaskiti.
I agree with what he says.	Kuntï jupajj siski ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
I mean really big.	Chiqpachansa jach’a sañ munta.
I think you are awesome.	Nayax amuyta jumax wali muspharkañawa.
Truly an amazing person.	Chiqpachansa mä muspharkañ jaqiwa.
No one knew that’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.	Janiw khitis yatkänti ukax nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
He spoke of it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uka toqet parläna.
There’s already been some bad stuff going on.	Nayratpachaw mä qawqha jan walinak lurañax utjawayi.
I have only blood.	Nayajj wila sapakiw utjitu.
I want to see how you feel in bed.	Kunjamsa jumax ikiñan jikxatasïta uk uñjañ munta.
That would be good, too.	Ukajj wali askïspawa, ukhamaraki.
This is a new yard.	Akax mä machaq yati.
That’s all .	Ukax taqpach .
I never had a problem with it.	Janipuniw uka toqet kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkitänti.
I’m not saying don’t do it.	Janiw nayax jan luramti siskti.
I told him I knew it.	Nayax juparux yatiyätwa.
How he likes it.	Kunjamsa jupajj gusti ukjja.
I'm not sure why that was.	Ukajj kunatsa ukajj utjäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
Let me know how it is!.	¡Kunjamsa ukax utji uk yatiyapxita!.
That’s the best thing you can do.	Ukaw jumatakix wali askïspa.
Nothing really happened, he thought.	Janiw kunas chiqpachapunix utjkänti sasaw amuyäna.
He refused to come .	Jupajj janiw jutañ munkänti .
I didn't understand that.	Ukjja janiw amuykayätti.
You can’t do that, of course.	Janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He didn't know anything.	Janiw kunas uk yatkänti.
So that leaves it.	Ukhamajj ukajj jaytawayi.
This wasn’t a plane.	Akax janiw mä avión ukhamäkänti.
I really want to know what that feels like.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk wal yatiñ munta.
Nothing he already knows.	Janiw kunas jupax nayratpach yatkiti.
So strange, he thought.	Ukhama muspharkañawa, sasaw amuyäna.
And it’s beautiful, and it’s fascinating.	Ukat wali sumawa, ukat wali muspharkañawa.
What happened to you happens all the time.	Kunatï jumar paskäna ukajj sapa kutiw pasaski.
He built the door.	Jupaw punku luratayna.
He never mentioned her name.	Jupajj janipuniw sutip arskänti.
He called me something.	Jupajj kuns nayar jawsäna.
I really want to do all of this.	Taqe ukanak lurañ walpun munta.
There’s no baseball there.	Ukanx janiw béisbol ukax utjkiti.
Now he was looking .	Jichhajj jupajj uñchʼukiskäna .
And he’s beautiful, of course.	Ukat jupax wali sumawa, chiqpachansa.
But it can’t be without it.	Ukampis janiw jan utjkaspati.
So I'm not sure.	Ukhamajj nayajj janiw walïkiti.
In fact, that’s exactly what he was doing.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw jupax luraskäna.
He lived alone in a single house.	Jupajj sapakiw mä sapa utan jakasïna.
He finished it quickly, and with great satisfaction.	Jupax jank’akiw tukuyäna, ukat wali kusisitaw tukuyäna.
But he has nothing to do here.	Ukampis jupax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkiti.
It’s not bad out there.	Uka chiqanx janiw jan walïkiti.
That’s really cool.	Ukax chiqpachans wali sumawa.
It was a little long and cold.	Mä juk’a jaya ukat thaya ukhamänwa.
He spoke quietly, a little too quickly.	Jupax amukiw arsüna, mä juk’a jank’akiw arsüna.
If you want coffee, make your own coffee.	Café munsta ukhajja, juma pachpaw café lurañama.
He said yes, and that was it.	Jupajj jïsa sasaw säna, ukajj ukhamänwa.
Tonight gave him a touch.	Jichha arumaw juparux mä chuym ch’allxtayäna.
He wanted to talk to her.	Jupamp parltʼañ wal munäna.
That’s good, after all.	Ukax wali askiwa, taqi kunat sipansa.
But that doesn't mean it didn't exist.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jan utjkänti sañ munkiti.
She was beautiful but sad.	Jupajj wali sumawa ukampis llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
It looks almost beautiful.	Niya suma uñtatawa.
This should be done immediately.	Ukax jank’akiw lurañapa.
Or it just felt that way.	Jan ukajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna.
It’s almost certainly the other way around.	Niya chiqpachapuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
He didn't say all that.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kuns arskänti.
A guy soon he is.	Mä waynax jank’akiw jupax.
It felt warm and soft and real.	Ukax junt’u ukat llamp’u ukat chiqpach ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
Nothing works, nothing ever works.	Janiw kunas irnaqkiti, janipuniw kunas irnaqkiti.
Just like I said.	Kunjamtï nayax siskta ukhama.
I did the same yesterday.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw qharürojj lurawayta.
I don't have them in me.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj nayan utjkituti.
I hope things work out for you.	Nayax suyt’twa kunanakas jumatakix askïspa.
He had seen it recently.	Jupajj jichhakiw uk uñjäna.
It felt pretty much the same.	Ukajj niya ukhamarakiw amuyasïna.
Winter is almost here.	Juyphi pachax niyaw purini.
Don't do this .	Janiw uk lurañamäkiti .
In fact, it is a lot of fun.	Chiqansa, ukax wali kusiskañawa.

I see him very very clearly.	Nayax juparux wali wali qhanaw uñjta.

It worked really well.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw wali sum irnaqäna.
It went away quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
He can build a house.	Jupajj mä uta luraspawa.
So soft and very cool.	Ukhama llamp’u ukat wali thaya.
There are not two of him.	Janiw jupat pä jaqix utjkiti.

It was often a mess.	Ukajj walja kutiw mä jan waltʼäwin sarnaqäna.
There can be no more time now.	Jichhajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati.
It actually worked well yesterday.	Chiqansa, qharüruw wali sum irnaqäna.
The guy is a nice guy.	Uka chachax wali sumawa.
The box, the box, the box	Ukaxa, ukaxa, ukaxa .
So far, no one has done that.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis ukham lurkiti.
Someone just did it.	Maynix ukhamakiw luratayna.
Another amazing day.	Yaqha muspharkañ uru.
It felt really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa amuyasïna.
I had no idea who it might be.	Khitis ukajj inas uk janiw yatkayätti.
That was another week in the top spot .	Ukajj yaqha semanaw nayrïr cheqan utjäna .
This went on all night.	Ukajj taqe arumaw pasäna.
It’s a great book.	Mä jach’a libro.
He told me all about it.	Jupaw taqe ukanak yatiyäna.
I’m so sorry for the inconvenience.	Nayax wali llakistwa.
But there was a real downside.	Ukampis mä cheqpach jan waliw utjäna.
No, he did more.	Janiwa, jupajj jukʼampiw luräna.
No one thought the worst of him.	Janiw khitis jupat jukʼamp jan walinak amuykänti.
He took good care of her.	Jupaw jupar sum uñjäna.
It’s not like they’re impossible.	Janiw jupanakax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He stayed there for a long time.	Ukanjja walja tiempow qheparäna.
I didn't understand them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakar amuyirïkti.
I’ve never been like that.	Nayax janiw kunapachas ukhamäkti.
I feel like this.	Nayax akham amuyasta.
But I don't know why he does that.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw yatkti.
Something is doing this.	Kunas ukham luraski.
Of course it has to do all of that.	Chiqansa taqi ukanak lurañapawa.
This is what has always been there.	Akax kunatix nayratpach utjki ukawa.
What’s wrong with you.	Kunas jumatakix jan walïki.
It’s also found in beer.	Ukhamarakiw cerveza ukan jikxatasi.
But he has looks.	Ukampis jupajj uñnaqaniwa.
It meant good meat.	Ukajj suma aycha sañ munäna.
He is not as .	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï .
I had nothing more to do.	Janiw jukʼamp lurañajj utjkitänti.
Because he’s this cool and all.	Kunatix jupax aka thaya ukat taqpach.
Of course, all of this is pretty amazing.	Chiqansa, taqi ukanakax wali muspharkañawa.
And what a place.	Ukat kuna chiqansa.
He didn't want to give up too much.	Jupajj janiw sinti jaytañ munkänti.
But that's what happened next.	Ukampis ukakiw jutïrin pasäna.
I’m looking for them.	Nayax jupanakar thaqhaskta.
But it's hard not to.	Ukampis jan ukham lurañajj chʼamakiwa.

You don't have to	Janiw jumax .
I really think you should.	Chiqpachansa jumax ukham lurañamawa sasaw amuyta.
So he asked for what he wanted.	Ukatwa kuntï munkäna uk mayïna.
There is happy activity.	Ukanjja, kusisit lurañaw utji.
You really can’t do anything wrong.	Chiqpachansa janiw jan walinak lurañjamäkiti.
Which is an unusual time.	Kuna jan uñt’at pachas.
For the first time, someone wanted him.	Nayrïr kutiw maynix jupar munäna.

I wonder where he went.	Kawkirus saräna sasaw jisktʼasta.

That’s all I can want from him.	Ukakiw jupat munasispa.
No, things are fine.	Janiwa, kunanakas walikïskiwa.
He was very moved by it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.

Which you absolutely must.	Ukax jumax chiqpachapuniw lurañama.
Overall costs are low.	Taqi chiqan qullqix juk’akiw utji.
You’re so bright, and a bit .	Jumax wali qhanawa, ukat mä juk’a .
Or a snowflake.	Jan ukax mä ch’uqi ch’uqi.
This is him now.	Akax jupaw jichhax.
I wonder how he knew.	Kunjamsa jupajj yatïna sasaw jisktʼasta.
It needs to be done in the middle of the day.	Chika urux lurañaw wakisi.
One never does that.	Maynix janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
I really don’t know how.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa uk yatkti.
Just last night.	Ukhama qhipa arumax.
He accepted it wholeheartedly.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw uk katoqäna.
Once in a while, he was very sad.	Mä kutix wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
That didn’t happen last year.	Ukax janiw pasïr marax utjkänti.
It started to rain.	Ukax jallu puriñ qalltäna.
Really small and that's about it.	Chiqpachansa jiskʼa ukat uka tuqitxa.
I won't go far.	Janiw jaya sarkäti.
Therefore, this feature can be avoided.	Ukatwa, uka lurañax jan utjkaspati.
Eventually, he moved on.	Qhepatjja, jupajj ukaruw sarjjäna.
He had done it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uk luratayna.
I don’t see anything outside right now.	Jichhax janiw kuns anqan uñjkti.
He’s in a class by himself.	Jupax sapakiw mä clasen jikxatasi.
He saw it somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa uñjäna.
I want to know how and why this happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna, kunatsa ukham pasäna uk yatiñwa munta.
I asked him once.	Nayax mä kutiw jupar jiskt’asta.
He wholeheartedly understands.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw amuyi.
Now he could see it very clearly.	Jichhajj wali sumwa uñjäna.
Whatever you want, whatever.	Kuntix munkta, kuna.
I’m really weird.	Nayax chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
And he didn't know anything.	Ukat janiw kuns yatkänti.
None of these things go and do it yourself.	Janiw kunas ukanak sarañax ukat juma pachpa lurañamäkiti.
So there was no other option.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
It really feels that way.	Chiqpachansa ukham jikxatasi.
And it’s time to let it go.	Ukat ukanak jaytañ pachaw purini.
If something happens .	Kunas pasaspa ukhaxa .
Very soon of course.	Wali jank’akiw chiqpachansa.
I rather doubt it.	Nayajj jukʼampiw uka toqet pächasta.
Everything is already .	Taqi kunas niya .
We all went to see him.	Taqeniw jupar uñjir sarapjjta.
But he wanted more.	Ukampis jukʼampiw wal munäna.
Do whatever you want with him.	Kuntï munkta uk jupamp luram.
Definitely the place.	Chiqpachansa uka chiqa.
He said he wanted me.	Jupajj nayaruw munta sasaw säna.
Alone, always alone.	Sapaki, sapa kuti sapaki.
He told me that once, long ago.	Jupax mä kutiw ukham sitäna, nayratpachaw.
It was exceptionally good.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, jan ukasti wali sumapunïnwa.
He’s feeling good now.	Jupax jichhax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But I just don’t know how to go about it.	Ukampis nayax janiw kunjams uka tuqit sarañax uk yatkti.
And he spoke about it immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw uka toqet parläna.
I have done everything about it.	Nayajj uka toqet taqe kunwa lurawayta.
Anything can happen after that.	Uka qhepatjja, kunas pasaspa.
But he didn't say anything.	Ukampis janiw arskänti.
Yes, he felt better now.	Jïsa, jichhajj wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He was available almost every year.	Jupajj niya sapa maraw utjäna.
He wondered how she would react.	Kunjamsa jupajj lurani sasaw jisktʼasïna.
You also need to do some work.	Ukhamaraki mä juk’a lurañanak lurañaw wakisi.
Nothing, all this is nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, taqi ukanakax janiw kunas utjkiti.
You tell me the rules.	Jumax kamachinak yatiyapxita.

You don’t really want to go inside.	Jumax janiw chiqpachapunix mantañ munktati.

He was asleep for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow ikiskäna.
Lots and lots of blood.	Walja ukat walja wila.
You should never do this.	Janiw kunapachas uk lurañamäkiti.
That’s what it’s supposed to do.	Ukaw uka lurañapa.
But for me, it was definitely time.	Ukampis nayatakejj cheqapuniw tiempojj purinïna.
Of course it never works that way.	Chiqansa janipuniw ukham irnaqkiti.
I don’t want to give a damn.	Janiw mä juk’a qullqi churañ munkti.
He was somewhere.	Jupajj kawkhansa jikjjatasïna.
He expected better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa suyäna.
I want to do more and more.	Nayax juk’amp juk’amp lurañ munta.
And he took care of it.	Ukat jupajj uk sum uñjäna.
So he tried not to do that.	Ukatwa jan ukham lurañatak chʼamachasïna.
Still a bit of coffee.	Wali mä juk’a café ukaw utji.
But now it happened, just like last night.	Ukampis jichhajj ukhamarakiw pasäna, kunjamtï nayra arumax ukhama.
I mean the worst.	Nayax juk’amp jan walinak sañ munta.
He knew nothing about the country.	Jupax uka markat janiw kuns yatkänti.
He is scheduled to be admitted to the hospital tomorrow.	Jupax qharüruw hospitalar mantañ amtawayi.
It really doesn’t.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurkiti.
That is not a good thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj janiw askïkiti.
In fact, it’s pretty obvious.	Chiqansa, wali qhanawa.
That was the problem.	Ukaw uka jan waltʼäwejj utjäna.

It feels like I did something right for once.	Mä kutikiw kuns chiqapar lurawaykta ukham amuyasi.
I want to see him myself.	Naya pachpaw jupar uñjañ munta.
But he didn’t really understand anything.	Ukampis janiw chiqpachapunix kuns amuykänti.
He didn’t mean that, of course.	Jupax janiw ukham sañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
In fact, this is rather surprising.	Chiqansa, ukax jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
He didn't really do anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns lurkänti.
No, obviously not.	Janiwa, qhanaw jan ukhamäkiti.

It looks awesome, actually.	Ukax wali muspharkañ uñtatawa, chiqpachansa.
But it’s not your job.	Ukampis janiw jumanakan lurañamäkiti.
This was perfect for me.	Akax nayatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
No one said anything bad about him.	Janiw khitis jupat jan walinak arskänti.

You’re a little sleepy.	Jumax mä juk’a ikiñan jikxatastaxa.

He did this a few times.	Mä qawqha kutiw ukham luratayna.
He said he loved the film.	Nayax película ukarux walpun munasta sasaw säna.
He was watching you the whole time.	Jupajj taqe tiempow jumar uñchʼukiskäna.
It really happened that fast.	Chiqpachansa ukham jankʼakiw pasäna.
And hotter, and hotter.	Ukat juk’amp junt’u, ukat juk’amp junt’u.
He was the most important person of all.	Jupajj taqe ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskir jaqënwa.
It may take a couple of hours to get there.	Inas mä pä horanak uka cheqar sarañajj wakischispa.
He didn't think it would ever happen again.	Jupajj janiw mayamp ukham pasañap amuykänti.
And so, for about an hour.	Ukat ukhamarakiw, niya mä horaw utjäna.

Also, the box is not.	Ukhamaraki, ukaxa janiwa.

He said he didn't know much about him.	Jupat janiw wal yatkti sasaw säna.
They didn’t have the money, of course.	Jupanakax janiw uka qullqix utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
He squeezed, then squeezed again.	Jupax ch’allt’äna, ukat wasitat ch’allt’äna.
He didn't want to come.	Janiw jutañ munkänti.
I never thought of myself that way.	Janipuniw naya pachpat ukham amuyirïkti.

He didn't want to drink.	Jupajj janiw umañ munkänti.
There is nothing, but nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, jan ukasti janiw kunas utjkiti.
I’m absolutely right.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw arsuwayta.
Interestingly, that’s not what I had.	Wali muspharkañawa, janiw ukax nayatakix utjkänti.
Everything is with him.	Jupampiw taqe kunas utji.
Now it’s time for me to go out.	Jichhax nayatakix mistuñ pachaw purini.

For one thing, he says he didn't.	Mä tuqitxa, janiw uk lurkti sasaw saraki.

He’s done too much too soon.	Jupax sinti jank’akiw sinti lurawayi.

You really should do it.	Chiqpachansa uk lurañamawa.

He felt differently.	Jupajj yaqha ukhamwa jikjjatasïna.

Money, not money, that’s what I care about.	Qullqi, jan qullqi, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.

Of course whatever you want you can find it here.	Chiqansa kunatix munkta ukax aka chiqan jikxatasi.
This was not the case in the past.	Ukajj janiw nayra tiempon utjkänti.
Of course, there wasn't much time left.	Chiqansa, janiw walja tiempox utjkänti.
So that's part of the problem.	Ukhamajj uka jan waltʼäwit maynïriwa.
And that one you don’t need.	Ukat uka maynix janiw jumatakix wakiskiti.

Something is terribly wrong.	Kunas wali axsarkañ jan waliw utji.

Do this several times a week.	Semanan walja kutiw ukham lurañama.
He didn't like them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar gustkänti.
It’s definitely not what you want it to be.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.

And it happened that it was.	Ukat pasäna ukax ukhamänwa.
He was the first to publish the book.	Jupaw nayraqat uka libro apsüna.
He struggled alone.	Jupajj sapakiw chʼamachasïna.
It’s been exactly the same for me.	Nayatakix ukhamarakiw chiqpachapunix utjawayi.

So he came to see you that day.	Ukatwa uka urux jumar uñjir jutäna.
I’m pretty excited about that, actually.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
He was very cautious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uñjäna.
He’s afraid to leave the house.	Jupax utapat mistuñ axsarayi.
I have no idea why he would do that.	Kunatsa ukham luraspa uk janiw amuykti.
I wonder what the future holds.	Jutïrin kunas pasani sasaw jisktʼasta.
He uses a lot of bad language.	Jupax walja jan wali arunak apnaqi.
But other than that it feels good.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa wali sumaw jikxatasi.
So, at least, not yet.	Ukhama, mä juk’a, janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
He desperately needed a job.	Jupajj mä trabajo walpun munäna.
He died rather quietly.	Jupajj jukʼamp amukiw jiwjjäna.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx arsuñ munkti.

There is nothing you can do at that point.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
And this, of course, is how it feels.	Ukat akax, chiqpachansa, kunjams jikxatasi.

And, the same amount.	Ukat, pachpa qullqi.
You can’t do the same thing.	Janiw uka pachpa lurañjamäkiti.
So, here’s what happened.	Ukhama, akax kunas pasäna.

That doesn't mean that, he said.	Ukajj janiw ukajj sañ munkiti, sasaw jupajj säna.
And he happily agreed.	Ukat wali kusisitaw iyaw säna.
It wasn't like he did it.	Janiw kunjamtï jupajj lurkäna ukhamäkänti.
Well, no, not really.	Ukhama, janiwa, janiwa chiqpachansa.

Something new needs to be done.	Mä machaq lurañaw wakisi.

He was just surprised, that’s all.	Jupax ukhamakiw muspharäna, ukakiw.

I knew he was a foreigner.	Jupajj yaqha markankir jaqëtap yattwa.
But not a day ago.	Ukampis janiw mä uru nayrajj utjkänti.
It’s always been that way.	Nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
It wasn’t what you think it was.	Janiw kunjamtï jumax amuykta ukhamäkänti.
This was something that needed to be done.	Akax mä lurañaw wakisïna.
It was too good to deny.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, janiw uk arskänti.

I want everything to happen now.	Taqi kunas jichhax lurasiñap munta.
But he didn't want to take it.	Ukampis janiw uka apsuñ munkänti.
And that’s how to do that.	Ukat ukhamaw ukham lurañatakix.
You’ll always feel that way.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham jikxatasïta.

But that wasn't the point.	Ukampis janiw ukajj amuyaskänti.

And there was nothing to do.	Ukat janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
No one was inside at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw khitis manqhan utjkänti.
And he needed someone, anyone, to get involved.	Ukat khitis, khitis, ukar yanaptʼañapatak munäna.
A happier time.	Mä jukʼamp kusisit tiempo.
He wanted a cold drink.	Jupax mä thaya umañ munäna.
But it will take a while.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempow pasani.
A couple more days.	Mä pä urunak juk’ampi.
I want wine.	Nayax vino munta.
Why that hasn't happened yet.	Kunatsa ukax janiw jichhakamax utjkiti.
Yeah, he just let it go.	Jïsa, jupax ukhamakiw jaytawayi.
That’s what he is.	Ukax jupax ukhamawa.
He rarely goes to town.	Jupax juk’akiw markar sarxi.
He was asleep, of course.	Jupax ikiskäna, chiqpachansa.
It looks very new.	Wali machaq uñtatawa.
If you do, that's a good thing.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja, ukajj wali askiwa.

The answer is yes, okay.	Ukax jïsa satawa, walikïskiwa.

Also, it’s not always the case.	Ukhamaraki, janiw sapa kutix ukhamäkiti.
He just knew somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa ukhamakiw yatïna.
It will be separate.	Ukax sapa mayniw utjani.
He accepted both.	Jupajj panpachaniw katoqäna.
Very little warmth.	Sinti juk’a junt’u.
He loves her very much.	Jupajj jupar walpun munasi.
He advised it.	Jupaw uk ewjjtʼäna.
It happens every year.	Sapa maraw pasaski.
I didn’t know the language.	Nayax janiw uka aru yatkayätti.
You will feel awesome about yourself.	Juma pachpat wali muspharkañ jikxatasïta.
The crowd was shaken.	Uka jaqenakajj wal chʼalljjtayasïna.
I recently saw an article about it.	Jichhakiw uka tuqit mä yatiyäw uñjta.
That happened yesterday morning.	Ukajj qharüru alwaw pasäna.
He has been in a lot of pain lately.	Jupax aka qhipa urunakanx wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
That’s all he does.	Ukakiw jupajj luri.
I want to do the best, the best.	Nayax wali suma lurañ munta, wali suma.
It is important that we do so.	Wali wakiskiriwa ukham lurañasa.
But that's pretty funny .	Ukampis ukajj wali muspharkañawa .
He wanted her very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupar munäna.
Everything happens for a reason.	Taqi kunas mä kunatsa utji.
Eventually, he felt better.	Qhepatjja, jupajj sumwa jikjjatasïna.
I always felt that.	Nayajj sapa kutiw uk amuyayäta.
He needs to do something, and now.	Jupax kuns lurañapawa, ukat jichhax.
That was the last thing he expected.	Ukaw qhip qhipa suyäna.
He has practically stopped eating.	Jupajj niyaw manqʼañ jaytawayi.
So much more to come!.	¡Ukhamajj jukʼampiw jutani!.
Or this morning.	Jan ukax jichha alwax.
What happened next was more.	Kunatï uka qhepat paskäna ukajj jukʼampiw pasäna.
He was making coffee.	Jupax café luraskäna.
You have to work with him.	Jupampiw chʼamachasiñama.
Somehow, there is a reason.	Kunjamatsa, kunatsa utji.
I want something big.	Nayax mä jach’a kuns munta.
But at the time, he was silent.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, amukiw jikjjatasïna.
That’s what he does every day.	Ukhamaw sapa uru luraski.
But we will do better.	Ukampis jukʼamp sumwa lurañäni.
The dining room.	Uka manq’añ uta.
And there is no need to rush it.	Ukat janiw jankʼak lurañax wakiskiti.
It crushed him in pain.	Wali llakitaw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
It was still really nice.	Wali chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
He goes home very soon.	Jupax wali jank’akiw utar sarxi.
I didn’t say anything like that.	Janiw nayax ukham kuns siskti.
I really want that.	Ukajj walpun munta.
He was very sad, always.	Jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna, sapa kutiw ukham jikxatasïna.
I almost feel like a fool.	Niya mä loqhe jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
No one anywhere around, you know.	Janiw khitis kawkhans jak’an utjkiti, jumax yatisktawa.
There, I feel comfortable.	Ukanjja, sum jikjjatasta.
It was the best time ever.	Uka tiempojj taqe kunat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa.

But he pulled it off.	Ukampis jupaw uka toqet apsüna.
It needs to be done better.	Jukʼamp sum lurañaw wakisi.
It’s really soft and delicious.	Chiqpachansa wali llamp’u ukat wali sumawa.
So yeah, it was really good.	Ukhamajj jïsa, chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
He’s just .	Jupax ukhamakiw .
I wish I could do it today.	Jichhürunakan luraspäna ukhajja, wali askïspawa.
So that’s the bottom line .	Ukhamajj ukajj akham sañ muni .
Maybe he needs to do that.	Inas jupajj ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
You don’t have to do a lot.	Janiw walja lurañax wakiskiti.
Like a film is made.	Kunjamtï mä película luraski ukhama.
Out of nowhere, like.	Jan kawkitsa, ukhama.
He really wanted to talk to her.	Chiqpachansa jupamp parltʼañ munpachäna.
I saw a word.	Mä aru uñjta.
There’s an important gap.	Ukanx mä wakiskir ch’amaw utji.
But at the moment, things are fine.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, kunas walikïskiwa.
And that wasn't the case.	Ukat ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
There is a lot of value in doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali askïspawa.
I don’t want to give anything away yet.	Janiw jichhakamax kuns churañ munkti.
Well, it’s too late.	Ukhama, wali qhipa.
He really just wanted to sleep.	Chiqpachansa, ukhamakiw ikiñ munäna.
He does not exist by himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj utjkiti.
Would definitely go again.	Chiqpachansa wasitatwa sarañax wakisispa.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Ukham lurañ janiw munkiti.
Someone moved quickly, he thought.	Maynix jank’akiw sarnaqäna, sasaw amuyäna.
¡I don't have anything!.	¡Janiw kunas utjkituti!.
He cares about your feelings.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk sumwa uñji.
But that’s certainly not the case for you.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw jumatakix ukhamäkiti.
He’s so .	Jupax ukhama .
Call me a fool.	Nayarojj mä loqhe satawa.
I can't quite figure out how to speed it up.	Kunjamsa jankʼak lurañax uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
It felt cold.	Ukax thaya pachan jikxatasïna.
So he started again.	Ukatwa wasitat qalltäna.
Or another job.	Jan ukajj yaqha trabajo.
But, it was pretty good.	Ukampis, wali sumapunïnwa.
The less you do it, the better.	Ukham jan sinti lurasax jukʼamp askiwa.
No, he did it himself.	Janiwa, jupa pachpaw ukham luräna.
To his surprise, he was hungry.	Ukat manqʼat awtjataw jikjjatasïna, ukajj wal muspharäna.
It needs to be real.	Chiqpach lurañaw wakisi.
And do it every couple of years.	Ukat sapa pä maraw uk lurañama.

All of these things had to be done.	Taqe ukanak lurañaw wakisïna.
He’s always here waiting.	Jupax sapa kutiw akan suyt’aski.
He’s cool with me.	Jupax nayamp chikaw wali thaya.
He did well in doing so.	Ukham lurasajj sumwa luräna.
He talked about you many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jumat parläna.
Almost always hot.	Niya ukhama sapa kuti junt’u.
Here’s what happened.	Akax kunas pasäna.
And how to do it.	Ukat kunjamsa uk lurañasa.
There really wasn’t any time for that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukatakix kuna pachas utjkänti.
This school was nothing like it.	Aka yatiqañ utax janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.

He doesn't know exactly how much.	Jupajj qhawqha qollqsa uk janiw sum yatkiti.
But it came late.	Ukampis qhepatwa ukajj purinïna.
No one spoke, so he finally spoke.	Janiw khitis arskänti, ukatwa qhepat arsüna.
This is the guy	Aka waynax .
That you have to do it yourself.	Ukajj juma pachpaw uk lurañama.
He’s the one who works.	Jupaw irnaqäna.
I don't know how to improve it.	Janiw kunjamsa jukʼamp sum lurañ yatkti.
He was right about that.	Uka tuqitxa chiqaw säna.
But yeah, that was pretty good.	Ukampis jïsa, ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
But do what you can.	Ukampis kuntï lurañjamäki uk luram.
He wanted more of it.	Jupajj jukʼamp munäna.
Is that what you think? 	¿Ukhamti jumajj amuyta?
He was here for some reason.	Jupax kunatsa aka chiqan jikxatasïna.
I listened again.	Nayajj wasitatwa istʼta.
He shouldn’t make his home in there.	Janiw uka manqhan utap lurañapäkiti.
That's how long it takes.	Ukajj qawqha tiempos pasaspa.
I don’t know what any of you want.	Janiw nayax yatkti kuntix jumanakat maynix munkta ukxa.

She had found a new guy.	Jupajj mä machaq waynaruw jikjjatasïna.
You can make the best out of what you have.	Kunatï utjki ukanakat jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
He’s terribly cold.	Jupax wali axsarkañ thaya jaqiwa.
This time it wasn’t.	Aka pachanx janiw ukhamäkänti.
Finally, he decided he had to act quickly.	Qhepatjja, jankʼakiw kuns lurañapa sasaw amtäna.
I’ve had it for ten years.	Nayax tunka maraw utjitu.
It’s got a face.	Ukax mä uñnaqaniwa.
But he knows how to know.	Ukampis yatiñ yati.
Heavy, hot rain began to fall.	Jach’a, junt’u jallu ch’uqi jallu puriñ qalltäna.
That’s him.	Ukax juparux.
I have done this several times at home.	Utan walja kutiw uk lurawayta.
And there was nothing there.	Ukat uka chiqanx janiw kunas utjkänti.
So I’m looking forward to doing everything .	Ukhamajj taqe kun lurañwa suyaskta .
Every day more or less.	Sapa uru juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi.
The husband said there was none.	Chachax janiw khitis utjkiti sasaw säna.
He feels that way, yes.	Jupax ukham amuyasi, jïsa.
It doesn’t work with me.	Janiw nayamp chika irnaqkiti.
He understood her feelings.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
Now he really wanted it.	Jichhajj jupajj walpun ukanak munäna.
We wouldn't have done anything.	Jiwasajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
And that’s fine with me.	Ukat ukax nayatakix walikïskiwa.
I want to say without saying too much.	Nayax jan sinti arsuñ munta.
So it could be a surprise.	Ukhamajj mä muspharkañ lurañaw utjaspa.
It’s the best time of the year.	Uka pachanx wali sumaw jikxatasi.
In fact, he never does.	Chiqansa, janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
There is no need for that.	Ukanjja, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.

Anyway, it looks great.	Kawkhansa, wali sumaw uñjasi.
Of course he is alone.	Chiqansa jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
There he was eager to tell her.	Ukanjja, walpun jupar yatiyañ wal munäna.
I can do no more, not yet.	Janiw jukʼamp lurirjamäkti, janiw jichhakamax lurirjamäkti.
That’s fine in this one.	Ukax wali askiwa aka maynix.
It doesn’t take long.	Janiw jaya pachax wakiskiti.
We have to do that all the time.	Jiwasajj sapa kutiw ukham lurañasa.
One other thing.	Mä yaqha.
For a moment he seemed to be a good man.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
At that time, he died himself.	Uka tiemponjja, jupa pachpaw jiwjjäna.
He didn’t know why, and now he didn’t care.	Jupax janiw kunatsa uk yatkänti, jichhax janiw kuns lurkänti.
I’ve done them a lot.	Nayax jupanakar walpun lurawayta.
After that, something happened.	Uka qhepatjja, kunas utjäna.
The snow in this country.	Aka markan ch’uqi ch’uqi.
So that's fine with me.	Ukhamajj ukajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
And he never does.	Ukat janipuniw ukham lurkiti.
And then he never did anything .	Ukat uka qhepatjja janipuniw kuns lurkänti .
What he was doing there in bed with her.	Kuntï jupamp chika ukan ikiñan luraskäna.
Now he doesn't want to go.	Jichhajj janiw sarañ munkiti.
And there is no real alternative to him.	Ukat jupat sipansa janiw kuna cheqpach yaqha lurañas utjkiti.
He wanted to make something of himself.	Jupa pachpat kuns lurañwa munta.
It’s got to do it, it’s got to do it.	Ukax lurañapawa, ukax lurañapawa.
No one wanted to come.	Janiw khitis jutañ munkänti.
Now I want to eat, I want to live.	Jichhax manq’añ munta, jakañ munta.
I am not sure what causes this.	Kunas ukham luraspa uk janiw sum yatkti.
No one is in jail.	Janiw khitis carcelan utjkiti.
I almost feel like it.	Niya ukham amuyasta.
A little bit more comfortable.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi suma.
He was devastated, devastated.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
I couldn't help it, either.	Nayajj janiw kuns lurirjamäkti, ukhamaraki.
Not soft but not harsh, either.	Janiw llamp’u ukampis janiw qhuru, ukhamaraki.
This sounds impossible, but it’s not.	Ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasi, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
Almost as good as it gets.	Niya wali sumawa.
But there is nothing to do about it here.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa janiw kunas akan lurañax utjkiti.
Everything is good here.	Taqi kunas akanx wali askiwa.
Still not a word.	Wali jan mä aru.
All of this takes a lot of time, but it is important.	Taqi ukanakax walja tiempow munasispa, ukampis wali wakiskiriwa.
This is the hardest part for you.	Akax jumatakix wali ch’amawa.
He was a very caring man.	Jupajj wali sum uñjir jaqënwa.

To me, this doesn’t matter.	Nayatakix akax janiw kunäkisa.
But there’s a lot of potential here.	Ukampis aka chiqanx walja ch’amaw utji.
So like, what can you do.	Ukhamajj kunjamtï, kunsa lurasma.
He was kind of nervous about it now.	Jupajj jichhajj ukanak uñjasajj mä jukʼa jikjjatasïna.
I saw it happening.	Ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
But he said no.	Ukampis janiw sasaw säna.
But better, of course.	Ukampis jukʼamp askiwa, chiqpachansa.

I see him now two years later.	Jichhajj pä mara qhepatwa jupar uñjta.
It looks really great as well.	Chiqpachansa wali jach’a uñtatawa ukhamaraki.
It doesn’t go wholeheartedly.	Janiw taqi chuyma sarkiti.
It can be a bad day.	Uka urux jan wali uruw utjaspa.
He said he made the wine.	Jupaw uka vino lurawayta sasaw säna.
It’s interesting about that now.	Jichhax uka tuqitx wali askiwa.
We’ll do it another day.	Yaqha urux lurañäni.
Which, he willingly admits.	Ukxa, jupax taqi chuymaw iyaw sañ muni.
He refused to believe her.	Jupajj janiw jupar iyaw sañ munkänti.
He saw the boy.	Jupajj uka waynaruw uñjäna.
It doesn’t, not right now.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw jichhax ukhamäkiti.
I don’t quite know how.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk sum yatkti.

Half an hour later.	Chika horanak qhepatjja.
That’s what gave me this.	Ukaw nayar aka churitu.
Of course no one really knows what happened.	Chiqansa janiw khitis chiqpachapuni kunas paskäna uk yatkiti.

I don’t want to tell them.	Janiw jupanakar sañ munkti.

Or three of them.	Jan ukax kimsa.

He was just still sleeping.	Jupajj ukhamakiw wali ikiskäna.
He didn't want to give it up.	Jupajj janiw ukanak jaytañ munkänti.
He was brewing something.	Jupajj kuns cerveza luraskäna.
He couldn't tell her.	Jupajj janiw jupar yatiyañ puedkänti.
Let’s see what happened here.	Kunas akan pasäna uk uñjañäni.
But now he didn't know what to do.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kun lurañsa yatkänti.
This may require improvement.	Ukatakejj inas jukʼamp sum lurañajj wakischispa.
Or that’s what it sounds like, at least.	Jan ukax ukham sañ muni, mä juk’a.
Nice to see you again.	Jumar wasitat uñjasajj wal kusista.

But isn’t that right.	Ukampis ¿janich ukhamäki.
And anyone can do that.	Ukat khitis ukham luraspa.
He desperately wants to do more.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jukʼamp lurañ muni.
It’s in a class by itself.	Jupa pachpaw mä clasen jikxatasi.
He wants to do it right.	Jupajj uk sum lurañwa muni.
But one of those things is funny.	Ukampis ukanak maynix wali muspharkañawa.
I was hungry for everything this morning.	Jichha alwax taqi kunat manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
You want to see if you can do better.	Jumax uñjañ munta, ¿jumax juk’amp sum lurasmati.

If we don’t do that.	Jiwasajj jan ukham lurañäni ukhajja.
And tomorrow, we’ll see.	Ukat qharüru, uñjañäni.
I want to improve myself.	Naya pachpaw jukʼamp sum lurañ munta.
He meant something and didn’t mean anything.	Jupax kuns sañ munäna ukat janiw kuns sañ munkänti.
That doesn’t mean it has to be done again.	Ukax janiw sañ munkiti, wasitat lurañapawa.
You need a place for that.	Ukatakix mä chiqaw wakisi.
The rainy season is awesome, too.	Jallu pachax wali ch’amawa, ukhamaraki.
He was never sincere.	Jupajj janipuniw taqe chuyma arskänti.

He speaks for himself.	Jupa pachpaw arsu.

He bought it immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw alasïna.
So it’s not quite everything.	Ukhamajj janiw taqpach taqe kunas utjkiti.
I did my homework.	Tareanak lurayäta.
Tell me something terrible.	Kunas wali axsarkañ yatiyapxita.
He saw the ball well.	Jupax pelot sum uñjäna.
He shook a sigh of relief.	Jupax mä jach’a jach’a tukuñ ch’allxtayäna.
He wanted to do the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañwa munäna.
Of course he can do everything.	Chiqansa jupax taqi kuns luraspa.

After all, a beer.	Taqi kunat sipansa, mä cerveza.
You have to do it right.	Uk sum lurañamawa.
But no one noticed it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uk amuyaskänti.
Same old same old.	Pachpa nayra pachpa nayra.
There is a reason for that.	Ukatakejj kuna razonas utji.
Bad, bad, and bad.	Jan wali, jan wali, ukat jan wali.
There is only one now.	Jichhax mä sapakiw utji.
No one knew exactly what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa sum yatkänti.
He was surprised to hear those words.	Uka arunak istʼasajj wal muspharäna.
I thought, no, let’s do this.	Nayax akham amuyta, janiw, uk lurañäni.
Nothing is good for you.	Janiw kunas jumatakix askïkiti.
He wasn't sure how he felt about her.	Kunjamsa jupar uñjäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
It is better than nothing.	Ukajj jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.

That’s good, and I like it.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukat nayax wali askiwa.
He stayed like that for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham qheparäna.
Nothing, nothing, nothing .	Janiw kunas, kunas, kunas .

He said that it didn't matter.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw säna.
That’s what matters.	Ukax kunatix wakiski ukawa.
It took me a while to get there.	Ukar sarañatakix mä jukʼa tiempow munasïna.
After that, I don't remember anything.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw kuns amtaskti.

At one time or another, there was no problem.	Mä jukʼa tiempon jan ukajj yaqha tiemponjja, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.

So much work had to be done.	Ukhamajj walja lurañaw wakisïna.
Or at least not for a while.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
In fact, he did it.	Chiqpachansa, jupaw uk luratayna.
It’s good enough already.	Ukax wali askiwa niyaw.
He quietly denies this.	Jupax amukiw ukax jan iyaw sañ muni.
And he did not want to tell anyone why he was going.	Ukat kunatsa saräna uk janiw khitirus yatiyañ munkänti.
That and nothing more.	Ukax ukat janiw juk’ampi.
It didn’t want to rain.	Janiw jallu puriñ munkänti.

I am so thankful for that.	Nayajj uka toqet walpun yuspärta.
It was very curious.	Ukajj wal yatiñ munäna.

He knew so much about it.	Ukham walpun jupajj yatïna.
I still didn’t want to tell you.	Wali jan yatiyañ munkayätti.
And in fact, that’s exactly what it is.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
But at the time, it was really bad.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, cheqapuniw jan walinak luräna.
It’s just what you need.	Ukax kunatix jumatakix wakiski ukakiw.
I don’t want him to do that.	Janiw nayax ukham lurañap munkti.
I don't see why we should.	Kunatsa ukham lurañasa uk janiw uñjkti.
He said he wanted to know the details.	Jupax uka tuqit sum yatxatañ munta sasaw säna.
One problem is that I thought I was very happy for you.	Mä jan waltʼäwejj jumatak wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw amuyayäta.

He did it for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow luräna.
I know that, of course.	Nayax uk yattwa, chiqpachansa.
So that was it for me.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
And he decided to do so.	Ukat ukham sasaw amtäna.
Maybe, of sorts.	Inas, mä kasta.
But no one knows for sure who it is .	Ukampis khitis ukajj uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti .
He stayed there for a week alone.	Jupajj mä semana sapakiw ukan qheparäna.
I if you think it’s interesting.	Nayax jumatix wali askïkaspas ukham amuyasta ukhaxa.
Why do you have to do this.	Kunatsa uka lurañax utji.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with that.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis uka tuqitxa utjkiti.
How do you do it yourself? 	¿Kunjamsa jumax lurasma?
He is a great talker.	Jupajj wali jachʼa parlir jaqewa.

There is no winter there.	Ukanx janiw juyphi pachax utjkiti.
Says what he means and means what he says.	Kuntï sañ munki uk arsu ukat kuntï siski uk sañ munaraki.
He was afraid of it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa ajjsaräna.

This is what I have so far.	Akax kunatix nayax jichhakamax utjki ukawa.
So I never expected this to happen.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukham pasañap suykayätti.
It’s a great night out.	Mä jach’a arumaw utji.
He walked in bed again.	Jupax wasitatwa ikiñan sarnaqäna.

She was so happy that it was a cold morning.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj wali thaya alwaw utjäna.
This is no longer necessary.	Ukajj janiw jukʼamp wakiskiti.
Of course he didn’t know all about it.	Chiqansa jupax janiw uka tuqit taqpach yatkänti.
But there were no people here.	Ukampis janiw jaqenakajj akan utjkänti.
I never said otherwise.	Janipuniw yaqha tuqit siskti.
Here’s another surprise.	Akax yaqha muspharkañawa.
He agreed, and we went.	Jupajj iyaw sänwa, ukatwa sarapjjta.
Of course, I need more time on that.	Chiqansa, uka tuqit jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
How does it know.	Kunjamsa uk yati.
I mean other nonsense.	Nayax yaqha jan walinak sañ munta.
You are so much fun, she said.	Jumax wali kusiskañawa, sasaw jupax säna.
But he couldn't do that either.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañsa puedkänti.
He has it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanakaw utji.
No, it won't be a problem.	Janiwa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
It looks better now.	Jichhax juk’amp sumaw uñtasi.
She loved him so much for that little helplessness.	Uka jiskʼa jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa jupar wal munasïna.

There’s too much energy.	Ukanx sinti ch’amaw utji.
But that was not the issue.	Ukampis janiw ukajj uka jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
You can do bad things to yourself.	Juma pachpaw jan walinak lurasma.
And so far it hasn’t.	Ukat jichhakamax janiw ukhamäkiti.

Always do what you want.	Sapa kutiw kuntï munkta uk lurañama.
One more thing needs to be done.	Mä jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
That's what he said.	Ukham sasaw yatiyäna.

That’s right, you know.	Ukhamawa, jumax yatisktawa.
He talked about it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uka toqet parläna.

But there’s one thing that’s fascinating.	Ukampis mä chiqaw utji, ukax wali muspharkañawa.

He wasn't sure how it would get to him.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupar purini uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He’s got a lot of energy in the area.	Jupax mä jach’a ch’amampiw uka chiqanx utji.
He didn't know what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk janiw yatkänti.
I think he’s in a lot of pain.	Nayax jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasi sasaw amuyta.

Who knows what’s going on.	Khitis kunas pasaski uk yati.
Yes, he is absolutely right.	Jïsa, jupax chiqpachansa ukham siwa.

But he really didn't say anything.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kuns arskänti.

Something really happened.	Chiqpachansa kunas pasäna.
He does it with energy.	Jupajj chʼamampiw uk luri.
Not today, of course.	Janiw jichhürunakanxa, chiqpachansa.
But that was a big maybe.	Ukampis ukajj mä jachʼa inas ukhamänwa.
He’s going to be fine, and he really wants to go.	Jupax wali sum sarxani, ukat chiqpachapuniw sarañ muni.

So he knows how.	Ukhamajj kunjamsa uk sum yati.
I just feel like that, that’s all.	Nayax ukhamakiw jikxatastxa, ukakiw.
But tonight he didn't seem to be in that mood.	Ukampis jichha arumax janiw uka chuymanïkaspas ukhamäkänti.
He thought it was beautiful.	Jupajj wali sumawa sasaw amuyäna.
Thank you so much for that!.	¡Uka tuqitx walpun yuspärta!.
Something worked for once.	Kunas mä kutikiw irnaqäna.
A young man said yes.	Mä waynax jïsa sasaw säna.
What do you want? 	Kunsa munta?
He had something to do at night.	Jupajj arumaw kun lurañas utjäna.
And one of two things can happen.	Ukat pä tuqit mayniw pasaspa.
You have many good years.	Jumax walja suma maranakaw utji.

The funny thing is, that means nothing.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, ukax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
It’s a great place to stay.	Ukax mä jach’a markanx wali askiwa.
But he didn’t know what else to do.	Ukampis janiw kuns yaqha lurañap yatkänti.
John was watching intently.	Juanajj wali sumwa uñchʼukiskäna.
Breakfast is served daily in the dining room.	Desayuno ukax sapa uruw manq’añ uta manqhan manq’añax utji.

Everything shook him up a bit.	Taqi kunas juparux mä juk’a ch’allxtayäna.

No one wants to go out.	Janiw khitis mistuñ munkiti.

He was already doing it.	Jupajj niyaw ukham luraskäna.
He definitely got it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka toqet katoqäna.
He didn't know how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Do that, he said.	Ukham luram, sasaw säna.

He readily agreed to do so.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk lurañatakejj iyaw säna.
Let them know that it’s okay for you.	Jumatakix walikïskiwa sasaw jupanakar yatiyañama.

Right the first time.	Chiqa nayrïr kuti.
That’s how he learned.	Ukhamaw jupajj yateqäna.
Of course, it takes a while.	Chiqansa, mä jukʼa tiempow munasispa.

He couldn't keep up.	Jupajj janiw ukham sarnaqañ puedkänti.

I know it doesn’t work.	Nayax yattwa janiw irnaqkiti.
Well, for me at least.	Ukhama, nayatakix mä juk’a.
The question is not that necessary.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
That shook him up.	Ukaw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
It has the appearance.	Ukajj uñnaqaniwa.
But he couldn't do that tonight.	Ukampis jichha arumax janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
There’s a place that gets a little more real-world.	Mä chiqaw utji, ukax mä juk’a chiqpach pacharuw puri.
He’s okay with that.	Jupax uka tuqitx walikïskiwa.
But it doesn’t go so well here.	Ukampis akanx janiw ukham sum sarkiti.

That didn’t surprise me.	Ukaw jan muspharkayätti.
He’s been there for three weeks.	Jupax kimsa semanaw ukan jikxatasïna.
I didn't really like him.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun jupar munkayätti.
I mean I really like it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw gustitu sañ munta.
It would take a very long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow munasispa.
I loved it, so thank you very much.	Nayajj wal munasïna, ukhamajj walpun yuspärta.
So don't give up on everything.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe kunsa jaytañamäkiti.
And then he decided not to.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jan ukham lurañwa amtäna.
I can't figure out why.	Janiw kunatsa ukham amuytʼirjamäkti.
That’s what they told me.	Ukaw sapjjetäna.
I’ve seen him in town.	Nayax juparux markan uñjta.
Then we went home again.	Ukat wasitatwa utar sarapjjta.
So he said, 'It's not.	Ukatwa jupajj säna.
About who wants what, who wants it and when.	Khitis kuns muni, khitis ukat kunapachas muni uka tuqitxa.
It was a good night for me.	Uka arumax nayatakix wali askiwa.
And then things started to go wrong.	Ukat ukat kunanakas jan walinak lurañ qalltäna.
But he never really did.	Ukampis janipuniw chiqpachapunix ukham lurkänti.
It’s staying power.	Ukax qhiparañ ch’amawa.
He probably would have done that.	Jupajj inas ukham luraspäna.

And the next morning.	Ukat qhipürux alwax.
He went with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw sarjjäna.
You have to do the right thing.	Suma lurañanak lurañamawa.

No one can disagree there.	Ukanx janiw khitis jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He did something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kuns luräna.
Maybe another day.	Inas yaqha uru.
This worked for about a year.	Ukajj niya mä maraw irnaqäna.
Do this two or three times.	Pä jan ukax kimsa kutiw ukham lurañama.

Small slices of snow.	Jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.

This is a bad guy.	Akax mä jan wali jaqiwa.

And you can’t have that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukham utjkaspati.

Not naked snowflakes.	Janiw q’ala ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Which he really should have done.	Kuntï jupajj cheqpachapun lurañapäkäna.
Maybe that's why he dumped you.	Inas ukatwa jupajj jumar jaqontäna.
At least it hasn’t.	Mä juk’a pachax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Now, it doesn’t work right now.	Jichhax, janiw jichhax irnaqkiti.
Do this with great caution.	Wali amuyumpiw uk lurañama.
I still love this thing.	Nayax wali munasiñampiw uka yänak munta.
What he says resonates with me.	Kuntï siski ukajj nayatakejj wali sumwa jikjjatasi.
All this happened three years ago.	Taqi ukanakax kimsa mara nayraw pasäna.
That was the first thing he saw.	Ukaw nayrïr kutix uñjäna.
The first step is pretty obvious.	Nayrïr lurañax wali qhanawa.
In the coffee shop.	Uka café ukanx.
No one else could have done it, except me.	Janiw khitis uk lurkaspänti, jan ukasti nayat sipansa.

That’s cool, isn’t it?.	Ukax wali sumawa, ¿janich ukhamäki?.
I'm going to go the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw sarä.
You can’t do this alone.	Janiw juma sapakix uk lurañjamäkiti.
Something was like that.	Kunas ukhamänwa.
The other one was like that.	Maynix ukhamänwa.
And in terms of research.	Ukat yatxatañ tuqitxa.
But there will be a time.	Ukampis mä tiempow utjani.
This is really better than nothing.	Chiqpachansa ukax jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
You can always do more.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp lurasma.
In the real sense.	Chiqpach tuqitxa.
Not if you want to stay here.	Janiw jumatix akan qhiparañ munsta ukhaxa.
I don’t know the truth.	Janiw cheq parlañ yatkti.

The first year is crucial.	Nayrïr marax wali wakiskiriwa.
Only I could do it, he thought.	Naya sapakiw uk luraspäna, sasaw amuyäna.
And he meant it, for the first time.	Ukat jupax uk sañ munäna, nayrïr kutiw ukham sañ munäna.
There seems to be no reason for that.	Ukatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkaspati.
Finally, he spoke first.	Qhepatjja, jupaw nayraqat parläna.
There’s only that one.	Uka mä sapakiw utji.
But that was all there was to it.	Ukampis ukakiw utjäna.
He could go no further.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sarañ puedkänti.

The weather can be warm or cool.	Pachax junt’u jan ukax thaya ukhamawa.
Nothing he wouldn’t do that year.	Janiw kunas uka marax jan lurkaspänti.
He thought he did a good job.	Jupax wali suma irnaqäw luratayna sasaw amuyäna.
I very, very rarely see that.	Nayax wali, wali juk’akiw ukham uñjta.
The reason for this is obvious.	Uka tuqitxa kuna razonas utji ukax qhanawa.
To be honest, he didn’t want to.	Chiqpachansa, jupax janiw munkänti.
No one wants to see that.	Janiw khitis ukham uñjañ munkiti.
It never means anything to me.	Janipuniw nayatakix kuns sañ munkiti.
Or is it not the same? 	Jan ukajj ¿janich ukhamäki?
That didn't really surprise me.	Ukajj janiw walpun muspharkayätti.
Do good, don't do evil.	Suma luram, jan jan wal luramti.
Of course, he didn't know where.	Chiqansa, kawkitsa uk janiw yatkänti.

And there is only one.	Ukat mä sapakiw utji.
No one knows for sure what the future holds.	Jutïrin kunas utjani uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.

He didn't say anywhere, or how.	Jupajj janiw kawkhansa, ni kunjamatsa siskänti.

It doesn’t mean it’s true.	Janiw chiqaw sañ munkiti.

It was a wonderful coffee.	Ukajj mä suma café ukhamänwa.
If you do, do it with caution.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja, wali amuyumpiw uk luram.
He could do as he always did.	Jupajj kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhamwa luraspäna.
And also tell us about yourself.	Ukat ukhamarakiw juma pachpat yatiyapxita.
The time before he did a little better.	Uka pachax janïr jupax mä juk’a juk’amp sum lurawayi.
He started going there.	Jupajj ukaruw sarañ qalltäna.
Or tell me the time.	Jan ukajj kuna horasas uk yatiyañama.
I’ve done research on that sort of thing.	Nayax uka kasta tuqit yatxatañ lurawayta.
He came early.	Jupajj nayraw jutäna.

He did a lot more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw wal luräna.

So not the housekeeper .	Ukhamajj janiw uta uñjir jaqejj .
He’s there for you.	Jupax ukan utji.
He was asleep for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj ikiskäna.
Now let’s see what’s next.	Jichhax kunas jutïrin utjani uk uñjañäni.

Or it will happen soon.	Jan ukajj niyaw pasani.
And he left yesterday.	Ukat jupax qharüruw sarxäna.
I would love to see you.	Jumanakar uñjañ wal munta.
He spent the entire work day indoors.	Jupax taqpach irnaqäw uruw uta manqhan jikxatasïna.
I feel a little too sorry for him.	Jupat mä jukʼa sinti llakista.
We have both of them.	Jiwasax panpachaniw utjistu.

And now something isn’t right there.	Ukat jichhax kunas ukanx janiw askïkiti.
That’s the best thing about this.	Ukax aka tuqitx wali askiwa.
So he did something.	Ukatwa kuns luräna.
It’s an amazing red, red blood.	Ukax mä muspharkañ wila, wila wila.
Just like the last time we did it.	Kunjamtï qhep qhepa kuti lurapkta ukhama.

He’s still sleeping.	Jupax wali ikiñan jikxatasi.
Yes, he did indeed.	Jïsa, cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
But he didn't know the truth.	Ukampis janiw kunatï cheqäki uk yatkänti.
He wasn't sure why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw sum yatkänti.
We won’t be here.	Jiwasax janiw akanx utjkaniti.
But he decided to do it, you know.	Ukampis jupax uk lurañ amtäna, jumax yatisktawa.
Well, maybe three.	Ukhama, inas kimsa.

She was a lovely woman, he said.	Jupax wali munat warmiwa, sasaw säna.
It will take time, he told himself.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasini sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
He talked to her longer.	Jupampiw jukʼamp tiempo parläna.

You guys are definitely something.	Jumanakax chiqpachapuniw kunas.
He said the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw säna.
I’ve left him for a long time.	Nayax juparux jaya pachaw jaytawayta.
But things will never happen now, will they?.	Ukampis jichhajj janipuniw kunanakas utjkaniti, ¿janich ukhamäki?.
But none of the modern kind .	Ukampis janiw khitis jichha tiempon utjki uka kasta .

He doesn’t know enough about this.	Jupax janiw aka tuqit sum yatkiti.
I have things I want to do.	Nayax kunanaktï lurañ munkta ukanakaw utjitu.
I really hope you enjoyed it.	Chiqpachansa, jumanakax wali askïspawa sasaw suytʼaskta.
In fact, it is better.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp askiwa.

Three times the amount.	Kimsa kutiw uka qullqix utjäna.
Of course, he said nothing about it.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa janiw kuns arskänti.

So I wasn't expecting to see it again so soon.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham jankʼak wasitat uñjañ suykayätti.
It required a bigger time frame.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp jachʼa tiempow munasïna.
But it’s all good at this point.	Ukampis taqi kunas aka pachanx wali askiwa.
This world is fascinating.	Aka pachax wali muspharkañawa.
That alone is never really good enough.	Uka sapakix janipuniw chiqpachapunix askïkiti.
I don't believe that one person can do that.	Mä jaqejj ukham luraspa sasin janiw creykti.
Didn’t want to give him the real thing.	Janiw jupar chiqpach churañ munkänti.
There’s nothing small about it.	Janiw kunas jisk’a ukax utjkiti.
There really can’t be one.	Chiqpachansa janiw maynix utjkaspati.
Breakfast and location are acceptable.	Desayuno ukat kawkhans jikxatasi ukax walikïskiwa.
He said that was not the case.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw säna.
I liked it but never again.	Nayax wali askiwa ukampis janiw mayamps ukham lurkti.

This should not be done in a negative way.	Ukajj janiw jan walinak lurasajj lurañapäkiti.
It happened twenty years ago, too.	Pä tunka mara nayraw pasäna, ukhamaraki.
How you think matters.	Kunjamsa jumax amuyta ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
It doesn’t offer innovation.	Ukax janiw machaq lurañanak churañ munkiti.
Yes, it is still useful today.	Jïsa, jichhürunakanxa wali askiwa.
But when it’s possible .	Ukampis kunapachas ukax wakisispa ukhaxa .
Much better, he says.	Walja juk’ampi suma, sasaw saraki.
Money isn’t much good here.	Qullqix janiw akanx sinti askïkiti.
Of course, he didn't want to go into detail about it.	Chiqansa, janiw uka tuqit sum yatxatañ munkänti.
I want a cigarette.	Nayax mä cigarro munta.
He agreed now.	Jupajj jichhajj iyaw sänwa.
I don’t remember a thing.	Janiw mä kunsa amtaskti.
He decided to get the coffee into him anyway.	Jupax kunjamatsa uka café jupar mantañ amtäna.
And he was a bad guy.	Ukat jupajj jan wali jaqënwa.
It was as if he knew the truth.	Ukajj kunatï cheqäki uk yatkaspa ukhamänwa.

So it’s not all there is.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe kunas utjkiti.
You don’t want to work like that this time.	Janiw ukham aka kutix irnaqañ munktati.
He had no idea how to do that.	Jupajj kunjamsa ukham lurañapa uk janiw amuykänti.
Someone always with you.	Maynix sapa kutiw jumamp chika.
He wanted to see what I had done.	Kuntï lurawaykta uk uñjañ munäna.
He knew nothing about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns sum yatkänti.
It took some work.	Ukatakejj mä jukʼa lurañaw wakisïna.
He didn’t want one because it was so heavy and heavy.	Jupax janiw mä munkänti kunatix wali jach’a ukat llamp’u ukhamawa.

He did better the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw jukʼamp sum luräna.

All of this will take time.	Taqe ukanakajj tiempow munasini.
He is a very pleasant man.	Jupajj wali kusiskañawa.
He can do just about anything.	Jupajj niya taqe kunwa luraspa.
I want to be myself.	Naya pachpaw munta.
I don’t want to make them.	Nayax janiw jupanakar lurañ munkti.
Now I feel sad.	Jichhajj llakitaw jikjjatasta.
I love doing it, or doing it, if you will.	Nayax lurañ walpun munta, jan ukax lurañ, jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
But what I see is the opposite.	Ukampis kuntï uñjkta ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Well, if you like that sort of thing.	Suma, jumatix uka kasta yänak munsta ukhaxa.
He wanted to leave so badly.	Jupax wali jan waliw sarxañ munäna.
Financial people are amazing.	Qullqi tuqit jaqinakax muspharkañawa.
And it will do so even more.	Ukat jukʼampiw ukham lurani.
It was fun and it was worth it.	Wali kusiskañawa wali askiwa.
I thought he could take care of himself.	Jupa pachpaw sum uñjasispa sasaw amuyayäta.
No one said anything about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet kuns arskänti.
Because anything can happen.	Kunatix kunas pasaspa.
But don't let that happen.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañapatak jaytañamäkiti.
That’s what you really need.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw munasispa.
At the time, he had no idea about it.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw uka toqet kuns amuykänti.
The day is coming soon and he will love it.	Uka urux niyaw purini ukat jupax walpun munasini.
That’s because it felt great.	Ukax kunatix jach’a ukham jikxatasïna.
Time is every hour of every day.	Pachax sapa horaw sapa urux utji.

He acted like he never wanted to give up.	Janipuniw jaytañ munkaspa ukhamwa sarnaqäna.
It’s exactly what you want.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kuntix jumax munkta ukawa.
No, it's more surprising.	Janiwa, jukʼamp muspharkañawa.
There was no reason to do so.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
But I think it's better.	Ukampis nayajj jukʼamp askiwa sasaw amuyta.
He went further.	Jupajj jukʼampiw sarjjäna.
He said he wanted money.	Jupax qullqi munta sasaw säna.
Because he’s beautiful.	Kunatix jupax wali sumawa.
I thank him more than he does.	Jupat sipansa jukʼampiw jupar yuspärta.
It was a very good night.	Mä wali suma arumaw utjäna.
But no one is like that.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.

He had no idea what he was going to do next.	Uka qhepat kunsa lurani uk janiw amuykänti.
But it is better now.	Ukampis jichhajj jukʼamp sumawa.
Someone did it to you.	Mayniw jumar luratayna.

Are you a guy? 	¿Jumaxa?
To be honest, it wasn't a problem.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.

And that’s good, too.	Ukat ukax wali askiwa, ukhamaraki.

Finally, he sat quietly.	Qhepatjja, amukiw qontʼasïna.
Would you like to help? 	¿Yanaptʼañ munasmati?
He was the first man.	Jupajj nayrïr jaqënwa.

And, of course, it is.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, ukhamawa.
This often takes two hours.	Ukatakejj sapa kutiw pä horanak sarañajj wakisi.
He cannot do it on his own.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj uk lurkaspati.
But there was nowhere to go.	Ukampis janiw kawkirus sarañajj utjkänti.
And real meat.	Ukat chiqpach aycha.
It’s what it does.	Ukax kuntix luraski ukawa.
It bought them in two ways.	Ukajj pä toqetwa jupanakar alasïna.
He never thinks he is greedy.	Jupajj janipuniw qollqe chuymanïkaspas ukham amuykiti.
Better than too little.	Sinti jukʼa lurañat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
That's not a good thing for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj walïkiti.
I’m pretty sure I’m going to see it again so soon.	Nayax niyaw ukham jank’ak wasitat uñjañ amtaskta.

And he was really worried.	Ukat jupax chiqpachansa llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Of course, I don’t understand anything.	Chiqansa, janiw kuns amuykti.
It could have done more.	Ukajj jukʼampiw luraspäna.
He left early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat sarjjäna.
But really kind of stupid.	Ukampis chiqpachansa mä jukʼa loqhe.
But he hasn’t done it yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax uk lurkiti.

But he feared something else, something bigger.	Ukampis yaqha toqetwa ajjsaräna, jukʼamp jachʼa toqetwa ajjsaräna.
He needed to do what he wanted to do.	Jupajj kuntï lurañ munkäna uk lurañaw wakisïna.
So cold, so cold.	Ukhama thaya, ukhama thaya.
I think there was none.	Nayax amuyta, janiw khitis ukham utjkänti.

We’ll have more days like this.	Jiwasax juk’amp urunak ukham utjani.

There was no future here.	Aka chiqanx janiw jutïr pachax utjkänti.

But I want to say it again.	Ukampis wasitat arsuñ munta.
I’m so happy right now.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jichhax jikxatastxa.
He didn't want to know about it at all.	Jupajj janiw kunatsa uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
None at this point.	Janiw khitis aka pachanx utjkiti.
Nothing gets you there.	Janiw kunas uka chiqar puriñkamax utjkiti.

So let’s do it right.	Ukhamajj sum lurañäni.
But let's see how he sees it.	Ukampis kunjamsa jupajj uñji uk uñjañäni.
He left two weeks ago.	Jupax pä semana nayraw sarxäna.
But there really isn’t.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw utjkiti.
Something is going on.	Kunas sarnaqaski.
But he quickly threw it away.	Ukampis jankʼakiw uk jaqontäna.
Something happened to him that night.	Uka arumax kunas juparux pasäna.
He spoke harshly.	Jupax wali qhuru arunak arsüna.
No, he said all of that.	Janiwa, sasaw taqe ukanak säna.
He is the only one you know.	Jupa sapakiw jumajj yatta.

The house was still and quiet tonight.	Uka utax jichha arumax wali amukiw ukat amukiw jikxatasïna.

There is no schooling.	Janiw yatiqañ utar sarañax utjkiti.
Tell me, or don’t.	Yatiyapxita, jan ukax jan.
You can’t do it all by yourself.	Janiw juma sapakix taqi ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
That’s what made him such a success.	Ukaw jupar ukham suma irnaqäwir tukuyäna.
I started doing the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw lurañ qalltawayta.
He’s a new person.	Jupax machaq jaqiwa.
And he asked how it was.	Ukat kunjamsa uk jisktʼäna.

Of course he was happy.	Chiqansa jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna.

I was really surprised by that.	Chiqpachansa ukax walpun muspharta.
But don't do anything right now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuns luramti.
He did not want to learn any other language.	Jupajj janiw yaqha arunak yatiñ munkänti.
You mean keeping me safe.	Jumax nayar jan kuna jan walt’äwin uñjañ sañ munta.
Therefore it does not mean .	Ukatwa janiw sañ munkiti .
I don’t need to go see this.	Janiw nayax aka uñjir sarañax wakiskiti.
I guess it wasn’t always the case.	Nayax amuyta, janiw sapa kutix ukhamäkänti.
He didn't want to .	Jupajj janiw munkänti .
Let us do what is necessary, when it is necessary.	Kunatï wakiski uk lurañäni, kunapachatï wakiski ukhajj lurañäni.
And then we’ll see.	Ukat ukat uñjañäni.
It was a very good seventh.	Ukajj wali suma satänwa.

He wanted nothing to see of her.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupar uñjañ munkänti.

And it’s still cruel.	Ukat wali qhuru.
Everything feels good about it.	Taqi kunas uka tuqit wali sum jikxatasi.

Really looking forward to dinner this evening.	Chiqpachansa jichha jayp’ux manq’añ suyt’askta.
But there are two possibilities.	Ukampis pä lurañaw utjaspa.
To be honest, it was for me.	Chiqpachansa, nayatakix ukhamänwa.
And she kept her eyes on his.	Ukat nayranakap jupan nayranakap uñchʼukiskäna.
And that’s just how it’s going to be.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw utjani.
This could be two years later or longer.	Ukajj pä mara qhepatjja, jan ukajj jukʼamp tiempow pasaspa.
It almost died out.	Ukajj niyaw jiwjjäna.

They were obvious.	Jupanakajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
He wanted to say something.	Jupajj kuns sañ munäna.
I’ve just done this.	Nayax jichhakiw uk lurawayta.
He never said anything.	Janiw kunapachas kuns arskänti.
I didn’t get that chance.	Nayax janiw uka ch’am jikxatkti.
He has done everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa lurawayi.
Really, a long time.	Chiqpachansa, mä jaya tiempo.
We both have something to do.	Panpachaniw kuna lurañas utjistu.
The ride took longer than I expected.	Uka autot sarañajj suykayäta ukat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow munasïna.
But somehow it happened.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham pasäna.
I don't remember exactly when.	Kunapachas uk janiw sum amtaskti.
He did a fine job of doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali sumwa luräna.
I’ll put that aside.	Nayax ukanak mä chiqar jaytawayta.
Now I never have to do that.	Jichhajj janipuniw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’s really a good guy.	Chiqpachansa jupax mä suma jaqiwa.
I still see it there.	Nayax wali ukan uñjta.
Many things can happen.	Walja kunanakas pasaspa.
Yeah, you said that once or twice.	Jïsa, jumax mä kuti jan ukax pä kutiw ukham sista.
Except, this time it was.	Jan ukasti, aka kutix ukhamänwa.
And he was very surprised.	Ukat jupax walpun muspharäna.
He’ll be going to bed soon.	Jichhakiw ikiñar sarxani.
Or him, as he put it.	Jan ukajj jupar, kunjamtï siskäna ukhama.
Something terrible had rubbed off on him.	Kuna jan waliw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
For the first time, he looked earnest.	Nayrïr kutiw taqe chuyma uñnaqäna.
Of course, we have to do both.	Chiqansa, panpachaniw lurañasa.
No and it isn’t.	Janiwa ukat janiw ukhamäkiti.
I love baseball.	Nayax béisbol ukarux walpun munasta.
Now it was beautiful.	Jichhajj wali sumapunïnwa.
I haven’t found anyone that looks like it.	Janiw khitis ukham uñtasit jikxatkti.
So that is very rare.	Ukhamajj ukajj wali jukʼakiw amuyasi.
Because, well .	Kunatix, wali .
I think it’s really cool.	Nayax amuyta chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
He’s sad and worried.	Jupax llakitaw jikxatasi ukat llakitaw jikxatasi.
I don't know what he thought.	Kunsa jupajj amuyäna uk janiw yatkti.
He started walking around the country.	Jupajj uka markanwa sarnaqañ qalltäna.
Didn't mean that much more.	Janiw ukham jukʼamp sañ munkänti.
But I don't know.	Ukampis nayajj janiw yatipkiti.
That is all he has.	Ukajj taqe kunaw jupatak utji.
But there is more time.	Ukampis jukʼamp tiempow utji.
I have no choice but to do so.	Nayax janiw yaqha lurañax utjkituti, jan ukasti ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Soft, soft, soft.	Llamp’u, llamp’u, llamp’u.
There was a slowdown.	Ukhamwa jikjjatasïna.
There are fewer now.	Jichhax juk’akiw utji.
I think so, yes.	Nayax ukham amuyta, jïsa.
There is no why and why not.	Janiw kunatsa ukat kunatsa ukham lurkaspati.
The process is beautiful.	Uka lurañax wali sumawa.
He pulled out a letter.	Jupajj mä carta apsüna.
He loved everything about her.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupat wal munäna.
He asked her about it seriously.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uka toqet jisktʼäna.
Very nice, she said.	Wali sumawa, sasaw jupajj säna.
I did everything by myself.	Naya sapakiw taqe kuns lurayäta.
It’s always something.	Ukax sapa kutiw kunas.
He was just as afraid.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw ajjsaräna.
You really don’t want to know what’s going to happen next.	Chiqpachansa, kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw yatiñ munktati.
I want to get myself a cup of coffee.	Naya pachpaw mä café apsuñ munta.
What’s in the future.	Kunas jutïrin utjani.
Eventually, everyone will have a role to play.	Qhepatjja, taqeniw lurañajj utjani.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Ukax janiw kunas wakiskiti.
Two years of innovation.	Pä maraw machaq lurañanak lurañax wakisi.
There’s a lot of fun there.	Ukanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He says that the.	Jupax akham siwa, uka...
And he felt the same way.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïna.
This is a good guy.	Akax mä suma jaqiwa.
I want to live in the city.	Nayax markan jakañ munta.
The weekly routine is important.	Semanan lurañax wali wakiskiriwa.
He says he’s sorry.	Jupax llakistwa sasaw saraki.
He took care of the place.	Jupaw uka cheqar uñjäna.
But I don't think he could.	Ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti sasaw amuyta.
But he knew how.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I really don’t know what to do about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns uka tuqit lurañ yatkti.
But tell me about opportunity.	Ukampis oportunidad tuqit yatiyapxita.
After that, he started drinking regularly.	Uka qhepatwa sapa kuti umañ qalltäna.
About what happened next.	Kunatï uka qhepat paskäna uka toqetwa.
He learned it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk yateqäna.
But that wasn’t the case in the real world.	Ukampis chiqpach pachanx janiw ukax utjkänti.
The food was delicious!.	¡Manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa!.
I understand this little bit.	Nayax aka jisk’a amuyasta.
Don’t leave it at that.	Janiw ukham jaytañamäkiti.
I think that’s the best thing I’ve ever done.	Nayax amuyta, ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
It means real water.	Chiqpach uma sañ muni.
Don’t like this one bit.	Janiw aka mä juk’a gustkiti.
He really seemed curious.	Chiqpachansa, yatiñ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
I didn't know the truth.	Nayajj janiw cheq yatkayätti.
It was at night.	Ukajj arumaw utjäna.
And who doesn’t love that?.	Ukat ¿khitis jan ukham munaskiti?.
But that was later.	Ukampis ukajj qhepatwa.
Make yourself uncomfortable.	Juma pachpaw jan walinak lurasma uk luram.
That was pretty much the end of it.	Ukaw niyaw tukuyäna.
Now that wasn't necessary.	Jichhajj janiw ukajj wakiskänti.
But no one understood them.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupanakar amuykänti.
I just found that amazing.	Jichhakiw ukajj wali muspharkañ jikjjatasta.
That’s the yes.	Ukaw jïsa.
So far every day has been like this.	Jichhakamax sapa uruw ukham sarnaqäna.
The night is really hard.	Uka arumax chiqpachansa wali ch’amawa.
They are more manageable.	Jupanakax juk’amp apnaqañ yatipxi.
The weather is still slow.	Pachax wali ch'amawa.
They have everything in there.	Jupanakax taqi kunaw uka manqhan utji.
And not much else.	Ukat janiw sinti yaqha tuqitxa.
I know this is very common.	Nayax yattwa akax wali uñt’atawa.
That surprises me.	Ukajj nayatakejj muspharkañawa.
Obviously it feels good.	Qhanaw wali suma jikxatasi.
Or never, really.	Jan ukax janipuniw, chiqpachansa.
Everything you do is a surprise.	Taqi kunatix lurapkta ukax mä muspharkañawa.
So far there is something.	Jichhakamax kunas utji.
I think it’s interesting and fun.	Nayax wali askiwa ukat kusiskañawa sasaw amuyta.
This is the most important.	Akax juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
There is no need to do that in this case.	Uka tuqitxa janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
But for that .	Ukampis ukatakix .
No, he didn't want to see her.	Janiwa, janiw jupar uñjañ munkänti.
It wasn't what he said.	Janiw kuntï siskäna ukhamäkänti.
So the problem is pretty obvious.	Ukhamajj uka jan waltʼäwejj wali qhanawa.
It’s hard, you know.	Ch’amawa, jumax yatisktawa.
It didn’t feel like one.	Janiw mä ukham amuyaskänti.
He had such a great time.	Jupajj ukham wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
Today, however, these are not necessary.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
I know how to keep a secret.	Nayax kunjams mä jamasat yatiyañ yatta.
And it would be even better.	Ukat jukʼamp askïspawa.
That's a good thing to do.	Ukham lurasajj walikïskiwa.
I don't know exactly how long.	Janiw qhawqha tiempos chiqpachapuni yatkti.
I went before them.	Nayax jupanakar nayraw sarawayta.
Tell me what that will be.	Kunas ukajj pasani uk yatiyapjjeta.
That’s just one of them.	Ukax mä ukhamakiw.
I’m feeling pretty strongly about that right now.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali ch’amampiw jichhax jikxatastxa.
He said he didn’t really see anything.	Jupax janiw chiqpachans kuns uñjkti sasaw säna.
I want both of those.	Nayax ukanak panpachaniw munta.
He’s still in the morning.	Jupax wali alwat jikxatasi.
It’s still not well known.	Wali jan wali uñt’atawa.
And a little bit more.	Ukat mä juk’a juk’ampi.
If you want to know what that something is.	Uka kunas kunas uk yatiñ munsta ukhaxa.
But one thing he knew.	Ukampis mä kunaw jupajj yatïna.
Someone except .	Maynix jan ukax .
But he couldn't let it go.	Ukampis janiw uk jaytañ puedkänti.
He looks great.	Jupax wali jach’a uñnaqaniwa.
The worst of all .	Taqi kunat sipansa jukʼamp jan waliw .
With me today.	Jichhürojj nayamp chika.
It was a cold, miserable night.	Uka arumax wali thaya, jan wali arumaw jikxatasïna.
Therefore we must do so.	Ukatwa jiwasajj ukham lurañasa.
Clearly, he would.	Ukham luraspänwa, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
That meant playing.	Ukajj anattʼañ sañ munäna.
I really don’t understand why.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunatsa uk amuykti.
This night it wasn’t.	Aka arumax janiw ukhamäkänti.
I don’t believe them.	Janiw jupanakar creykti.
If it had done anything, he would have done something.	Ukajj kuns luraspäna ukhajja, jupajj kuns luraspänwa.
It’s kind of unique.	Ukax mä kasta jan uñt’atawa.
There is nothing I can do to help them.	Jupanakar yanaptʼañatakejj janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
I don't care what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta ukajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa.
I look forward to talking to both of you tomorrow.	Qhipürux panpachaniw parltʼañ suyaskta.
Tell everyone about it.	Taqiniruw uka tuqit yatiyañama.
But he is no different.	Ukampis jupajj janiw yaqha ukhamäkiti.
I was sad and a little sad.	Nayax llakitaw jikxatasiyäta ukat mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
I had myself that day.	Uka urux naya pachpaw utjäna.
Everything is fine here.	Aka chiqanx taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
There will be no one.	Janiw khitis utjkaniti.
I am a little unsure myself.	Naya pachpaw mä jukʼa jan sum yatta.
Don't give me a	Janiw nayarojj .
So he went alone.	Ukatwa sapaki sarnaqäna.
There is always money involved.	Uka tuqitxa sapa kutiw qullqix utji.
Winter has been around for a while now.	Juyphi pachax mä juk’a pachaw jichhax utji.
Very nice, but mature.	Wali sumawa, ukampis jilïr jaqiwa.
He was asleep.	Jupax ikiskäna.
Two or three.	Pä jan ukax kimsa.
He was just gruff.	Jupax ukhamakiw qhuru arunak arsüna.
He went away alone.	Jupa sapakiw sarxäna.
He didn't want to do it, and he knew it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañ munkänti, ukat uk sum yatïna.
He says he decided to take it now.	Jupax jichhax apsuñ amtawayta sasaw saraki.
But he was right about one thing.	Ukampis mä tuqitxa chiqaw säna.
There will be a slowdown.	Ukhamaw utjani.
It started quietly.	Ukajj amukiw qalltäna.
A week, maybe, every year.	Mä semana, inas, sapa mara.
In fact, he was rather surprised.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼampiw muspharäna.
And he was a very nice guy.	Ukat wali suma jaqënwa.
The weather is getting better.	Tiempo jukʼamp sumaw purini.
I thought he wanted to know everything and control everything.	Taqe kun yatiñ muni ukat taqe kun apnaqañ muni sasaw amuyayäta.
But I didn’t really understand.	Ukampis janiw cheqpach amuykayätti.
I’m in love with him.	Nayax juparux munasiñampiw uñjta.
You can't have a problem with me.	Janiw nayamp kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
That seems like an impossibility.	Ukax mä jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
This really needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa akax lurañaw wakisi.
But that would take a long time.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow munasispa.
He wanted to know, that’s all.	Jupax yatiñ munäna, ukakiw utjäna.
I have to do it right.	Nayax chiqapar lurañamawa.
I don’t want to hurt him.	Janiw jupar jan walinak lurañ munkti.
I don't know anything about you.	Nayajj janiw jumanakat kuns yatkti.
He’s more human than I am.	Jupax nayat sipan juk’amp jaqiwa.
But who is the question.	Ukampis khitis uka jisktʼajj utji.
Something happened tonight that he thought was impossible.	Jichha arumax kunas pasäna, ukax janiw lurañjamäkiti sasaw amuyäna.
And indeed, it happened.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamaw pasäna.
There was no problem traveling from one city to another.	Mä markat markar sarañatakix janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He did it with great love.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw uk luräna.
No really, he said yesterday.	Janiwa chiqpachansa, jupax qharüruw ukham säna.
But he is still a great man.	Ukampis wali jachʼa jaqewa.
I just can't figure you out.	Nayajj janiw jumar amuytʼirjamäkti.
In today's house.	Jichhürunakan utapan.
The old bad place.	Nayra jan wali chiqa.
There is still plenty of time.	Wali walja tiempow utji.
He loves them more than anything.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼampiw jupanakar munasi.
And it doesn’t take time.	Ukat janiw tiempox munaskiti.
I only heard them once.	Mä kutikiw jupanakar istʼta.
Do it alone, you know.	Sapakiw uk luram, jumax yatisktawa.
I think he’s worried.	Nayax amuyta jupax llakitaw jikxatasi.
So he worked for two years and went home.	Ukatwa pä mara irnaqäna ukat utaparuw sarjjäna.
Of course, he understood the danger.	Chiqansa, kuna jan waltʼäwis utjaspa uk sum amuyäna.
You do your best.	Jumax taqi ch’amampiw lurasma.

It’s really big, it’s really small.	Chiqpachansa jach’a jaqiwa, chiqpachansa jisk’a jaqiwa.
Why did this happen?'	¿Kunatsa ukham pasäna?’ sasa.
Do it now, please.	Jichhax uk luram.
You are a cruel, horrible person.	Jumax mä qhuru, wali axsarkañ jaqiwa.
He has looks, of course.	Jupax uñnaqaniwa, chiqpachansa.
Any money is worth it.	Kuna qullqis wali askiwa.
She did the housework very well.	Jupaw utan lurañanak wali sum luräna.
Perhaps he did not want to attend.	Inas uka tantachäwir jan sarañ munpachäna.
It’s surprisingly useful.	Ukax muspharkañ askiwa.
Heavier or something.	Juk’ampi llamp’u jan ukax kunas.
I thought it was better.	Nayajj jukʼamp askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
One is not necessary.	Maynix janiw wakiskiti.
You may not know about it.	Inas jumajj uka toqet jan yatkayätati.
So very, very small amount.	Ukhama wali, wali jisk’a qullqi.
Something that is true or factual.	Kunatï cheqäki jan ukajj cheqäki ukajja.
But I understand.	Ukampis amuyasta.
I’ve seen this time and time again.	Nayax aka kutiw walja kuti uñjta.
There was a lot of energy in the room.	Uka cuarto ukanx walja ch’amaw utjäna.
It’s better not to eat.	Jan manq’añax wali askiwa.
I was sad, I was sad.	Nayax llakitaw jikxatasiyäta, llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He gave it all to her.	Taqi ukanak jupar churäna.
I love doing it.	Uk lurañajj wal gustitu.
He was silent as he walked there.	Ukar sarkasajj amukiw jikjjatasïna.
He barely admitted it himself.	Jupa pachpajj jukʼakiw uk iyaw säna.
What can happen for it.	Kunas ukatakix pasaspa.
But there is a little work to be done.	Ukampis mä jukʼa lurañaw utji.
I don’t know what’s good.	Janiw kunas wali askïspa uk yatkti.
This is some guy.	Akax mä qawqha waynawa.
But she knew he didn't like it that way.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham gustkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
It was, as always, wonderful.	Ukajj kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, wali sumapunïnwa.
Good night wind.	Suma arumax thaya.
This is strongly believed to be true.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw chiqaw sasin amuyasi.
But no, he couldn't talk to anyone.	Ukampis janiw, janiw khitimpis parlañ puedkänti.
But next year or the next .	Ukampis jutïr mara jan ukajj qhepa mara .
He said he couldn’t do it.	Janiw lurañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
A man who is not right.	Mä chachar jan walïki.
Do something yourself.	Kun lurañsa juma pachpa luram.
It did nothing for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkänti.
As he himself had just done.	Kunjamtï jupa pachpajj jichhajj lurkäna ukhama.
He had done the right thing.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk luratayna.
But let's take a closer look.	Ukampis uk jukʼamp sum uñjañäni.
Except for now.	Jan ukasti jichhax.
No, not you at all.	Janiwa, janiw jumajj kunjamatsa.
Who knows what it could be?	¿Khitis yatpachati kunas ukajj utjaspa?
And, he did it carefully.	Ukat, jupax wali amuyumpiw uk luratayna.
That's not a bad thing for me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj jan walïkiti.
I know one thing for sure.	Mä toqetwa sum yatta.
It felt very bad.	Wali jan waliw amuyasïna.
But that looks bad.	Ukampis ukajj jan wali uñnaqaniwa.
These are obvious.	Ukanakajj qhanaw amuyasi.
I love the way he thought.	Kunjamsa jupajj amuyäna uk walpun munasta.
I have no idea what to do from here.	Nayax janiw kuns aka chiqat lurañ amtkti.
He didn't really mean it.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun uk sañ munkänti.
This isn’t a good thing.	Akax janiw walïkiti.
He admitted that it was.	Ukhamänwa sasaw jupajj arsüna.
Whether you want to see it or not.	Uñjañ munasmati janicha.
A delicious food festival.	Mä suma manq’añ fiesta.
No one knew how it would turn out.	Kunjamsa pasani uk janiw khitis yatkayätti.
He often stayed in bed during the cold season.	Jupajj thaya tiemponjja, sapa kutiw ikiñan qheparäna.
No one seems to know what happened.	Kunas ukajj pasäna uk janis khitis yatkaspa ukhamawa.
If he’s a good guy.	Ukaxa jupax wali suma jaqiwa.

He doesn't want anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa munkiti.
He loves me so much.	Jupajj nayat walpun munasi.
I think it works for me.	Nayax amuyta, nayatakix walikïskiwa.
After that, there was no one.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw khitis utjkänti.
He said he wanted to come.	Jupax jutañ munta sasaw säna.
Well, here’s your thing.	Ukhama, akax jumanakan kunas.
He’s so happy for me.	Jupax nayatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He asked her if she wanted a cup of coffee.	Jupajj mä café umañ munasmati sasaw jisktʼäna.
This guy decided to do the same.	Aka waynax ukhamarakiw lurañ amtäna.
I understand why he likes it so much.	Kunatsa jupar wal gusti uk sum amuyta.

You know yourself well.	Jumax juma pachpaw sum yatta.
It’s really hard, but it’s still possible.	Chiqpachansa, ukax ch’amawa, ukampis wali ch’amawa.
You will need to do two things.	Pä lurañaw wakisini.
The same people won’t be there again and again.	Pachpa jaqinakax janiw walja kuti utjkaniti.
It wasn’t the other way around.	Janiw yaqha tuqitxa ukhamäkänti.
The guy is a keeper.	Uka waynax mä uñjir jaqiwa.
He did this work for many years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw uka trabajo luräna.

Everything is as it happened.	Taqi kunas kunjamtï paskäna ukhamawa.
That’s exactly the opposite.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw yaqha tuqitxa.
The importance of each is rare.	Sapa maynix wali wakiskiriwa, ukax juk’akiw utji.
He said something.	Jupajj kunsa sänwa.
Importantly, though, he felt comfortable.	Ukampis wali wakiskiriwa, jupajj sumwa jikjjatasïna.
I know what the weather is like out there.	Nayax yattwa kunjams pachax uka chiqanx utji.
But that was too late.	Ukampis ukajj walja tiempo qhepatwa pasäna.
Tell me everything you know.	Taqi kuntix yatkta uk yatiyapxita.

Everyone is creative.	Taqinipuniw lurañanak lurañ yatipxi.

He doesn't know the truth.	Jupajj janiw kunatï cheqäki uk yatkiti.

That was all anyone did.	Ukajj taqe kunaw khitis luräna.
No, he never did that once.	Janiwa, janipuniw mä kutis ukham lurkänti.
Of course there was nothing like it.	Chiqansa janiw kunas ukham utjkänti.
It feels very real.	Wali cheqapuniw ukham jikjjatasi.

And, the next day.	Ukat, qhipürux.
They don't know what really happened.	Kunas cheqpachapun pasäna uk janiw yatipkiti.
I want to work with you.	Nayax jumamp chika irnaqañ munta.
For a long time, there was not much time.	Walja tiempojj janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
The guy is nobody.	Uka waynax janiw khitis utjkiti.
There is no way to do that.	Ukham lurañax janiw utjkiti.
But he loved her very much.	Ukampis jupajj jupar wal munäna.
In that case, anything can happen.	Uka tuqitxa, kunas pasaspa.
I am not sure about that now.	Jichhajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkti.
I did these things today.	Jichhüruw ukanak lurawayta.
He was the one who took care of me.	Jupaw nayar taqe chuyma uñjäna.
But that's not even the real problem here.	Ukampis janiw ukajj aka cheqan cheqpach jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
He could have done it, yes.	Jupajj uk luraspänwa, jïsa.
There is room for improvement.	Uka tuqitxa, jukʼamp sum lurañaw utji.
So he called them.	Ukatwa jupanakar jawsäna.
He loves her, not me.	Jupaw jupar munasi, janiw nayar munaskiti.
Already a room.	Nayraqat mä cuarto.
Of course, there was none for me.	Chiqansa, janiw nayatakix utjkänti.
That alone was wonderful.	Uka sapakix wali sumapunïnwa.
Today, not really.	Jichhürunakanxa, janiw chiqpachansa.
Well that’s not what it says or means.	Suma ukax janiw kuntix siski jan ukax sañ munkiti.
It is very clear to me what is happening.	Kunas pasaski ukajj nayatakejj wali qhanawa.
But you don’t want that.	Ukampis janiw uk munktati.
I didn’t want to make that decision.	Janiw uka amtar puriñ munkayätti.
He looked worried, but he had something else to do.	Jupax llakitaw uñnaqäna, ukampis yaqha lurañaw utjäna.
We’d have to do that.	Jiwasax ukham lurañaw wakisispa.
There is only one good person.	Mä sapakiw suma jaqejj utji.

But he doesn't always do that.	Ukampis janiw sapa kuti ukham lurkiti.
That's all you need.	Ukajj jumanakan walikïskiwa.
There is very little here.	Aka chiqanx wali juk’akiw utji.
Surprisingly, he was very upset.	Muspharkañawa, jupax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I wasn't sure what the next step would be.	Jutïr lurañajj kunas wakisispa uk janiw sum yatkayätti.
Of course there will be no problem.	Chiqansa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
I think he’s right about this.	Nayax amuyta, jupax chiqpachapuniw aka tuqitxa.
He was sleeping under the bed.	Jupax ikiñ manqhan ikiskäna.
Because that’s why this is so important.	Kunatix ukax akax wali wakiskiriwa.

Every morning, same.	Sapa alwaw, pachpa.
Wherever he went, whatever he did.	Kawkirus saräna, kunsa luräna.
I told him that before.	Nayax nayraw ukham jupar sista.

And now you feel the same way.	Ukat jichhax jumax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïta.
He is not as bad as you think he is.	Jupajj janiw kunjamtï jumajj jupat amuykta ukham jan walïkiti.
He couldn't pull it off.	Jupajj janiw ukanak apsuñ puedkänti.
But he went through with it.	Ukampis jupajj uka toqetwa pasäna.
I understand the question perfectly.	Uka jisktʼajj sumwa amuyasta.
Which he didn't have.	Ukajj janiw jupajj utjkänti.
He was just being mean.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jan walinak luraskäna.
Does labor need to be done?.	¿Trabajo lurañax wakisispati?.
We’ll make it that good.	Jiwasax ukham suma lurañäni.
But often nothing is possible.	Ukampis walja kutiw janiw kunas utjkaspati.
He immediately began to act.	Ukat jankʼakiw kuns lurañ qalltäna.
This seems impossible.	Ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw amuyasi.
I asked more questions.	Jukʼamp jisktʼanak jisktʼasta.
He stared, not understanding the word.	Jupajj uñchʼukiskäna, janiw uka aru amuykänti.
Tell me exactly what happened next.	Kunas uka qhepat pasäna uk sum yatiyapjjeta.
There was more silence after that.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼamp amukiw utjäna.
I only saw him once after that.	Uka qhepatjja, mä kutikiw jupar uñjta.
Now there’s nothing he can do for me.	Jichhax janiw kunas jupax nayatakix lurkaspati.
Like before or after that.	Kunjamtï uka nayrajj jan ukajj uka qhepat lurkäna ukhama.
Someone called the police.	Maynix policiaruw jawsäna.
So he said yes to it.	Ukatwa jupax jïsa säna.
That’s what the man meant.	Ukhamaw chachax sañ munäna.
But I do understand it well.	Ukampis nayajj sum amuyta.
I could do this all day.	Nayax urunakpachaw uk lurasmati.
Even a couple of snowflakes.	Nayraqat mä pä ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I don't really believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk cheqpachapun creykti.
He really didn't know much about anything.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kuna tuqitsa sum yatkänti.
And he treated me the same way.	Ukat jupajj nayarojj ukhamarakiw uñjäna.
That doesn't matter to anyone.	Ukajj janiw khitirus kunäkisa.
There’s still a prominent part, there’s an important part.	Wali uñt’at chiqaw utji, wali wakiskir chiqaw utji.

And you think there’s no way he knows that.	Ukat jumax akham amuyta, janiw kunjamatsa jupax uk yatkiti.

He shook the snow.	Jupax ch’uqi ch’allxtayäna.
Kind of too much.	Mä kasta sinti jach’a.
What we need is.	Kuntï jiwasajj wakiski ukajja.
He was afraid to do things alone.	Jupajj sapakiw kuns lurañ ajjsaräna.
So he accepted it.	Ukatwa jupajj katoqäna.
I wonder how he feels.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasi sasaw jisktʼasta.
But it wasn’t, for some reason.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, kunatsa.
But what is happening now is quite the opposite.	Ukampis kunatï jichhajj pasaski ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Everything seems out of control.	Taqi kunas jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
Now I am very happy about it.	Jichhajj uka toqet wal kusista.

He knew very well that she couldn’t refuse him.	Jupax wali sum yatïna, jupax janiw jupar jan iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He asked me how I knew.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk yatta sasaw jisktʼitäna.

Thank you so much for doing so.	Ukham lurasajj walpun yuspärta.
It’s hard all the time.	Taqi pachan ch’amawa.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj nayat wal munäna.
There are no coffee shops in town.	Janiw markanx café ukanakax utjkiti.
He obviously didn't want to talk.	Janiw parlañ munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I don't have them.	Nayajj janiw jupanakajj utjkituti.
I'd rather do it alone.	Naya sapakiw uk lurañajj jukʼamp askejja.
He had no idea who it was.	Jupajj janiw khitis uka jaqejj uk amuykänti.
But it was that much better.	Ukampis ukham jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
Not that old really.	Janiw uka nayra chiqpachansa.
He wanted to know two things.	Jupajj pä toqetwa yatiñ munäna.
It’s why you’re in the room.	Ukax kunatsa jumax uka cuarto ukan jikxatastaxa.
I want to say a word.	Mä aru arsuñ munta.
I’m kind of excited for that.	Nayax ukatakix mä juk’a kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But I think there is something to that.	Ukampis ukajj kunas utji sasaw amuyta.
Or rather, he did it better.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp sumwa luräna.
That’s where you need it.	Ukax kawkhans munasispa.
I know he can, .	Nayax yattwa jupax ukham luraspa, .
But it really works for me.	Ukampis chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
He found out later.	Jupajj qhepatwa ukham jikjjatasïna.
He’s already decided.	Jupax nayratpach amtawayi.
He falls asleep.	Jupax ikiñar puri.
It was nice but not that good.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
And now he’s alone.	Ukat jichhax sapakiw jikxatasi.
He is in desperate need of help.	Jupajj wal yanaptʼa muni.
You’re not really sure about it.	Jumax janiw chiqpachapuni uka tuqit sum yatkayätati.

And of course, it was.	Ukat chiqansa, ukhamänwa.
You’re already alone here.	Jumax nayratpach sapakiw akan jikxatasïta.

But what do you have, a bit about me.	Ukampis kunas jumatakix utji, nayat mä jukʼa.

He was surprised to see her.	Jupajj jupar uñjasajj wal muspharäna.
He desperately needed some water.	Jupajj mä jukʼa uma wal munäna.

That’s how much the person appreciates it.	Ukhamaw uka jaqix wali askit uñji.

It happens all the time.	Ukax sapa kutiw pasäna.
It is important to do this now.	Jichhajj uk lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
And he said it again.	Ukat wasitatwa säna.
And I started the process very carefully.	Ukat nayax wali amuyumpiw uka lurañ qalltawayta.
I don’t want that, after all.	Janiw nayax uk munkti, taqi kunat sipansa.
You’re really coming.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw jutta.
He saw them himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupanakar uñjäna.
Probably longer.	Inas jukʼamp jaya.
But he has no one.	Ukampis jupajj janiw khitis utjkiti.
But, this guy is good.	Ukampis, aka waynax wali sumawa.
Something? 	Kunsa?
I thought this would do but it doesn’t.	Nayax akax luraspawa sasaw amuyayäta ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
You are beautiful, he said.	Jumax wali sumawa, sasaw säna.
Money one always wants.	Qullqix maynix sapa kutiw munäna.
There was no time like the present.	Jichha pachax janiw kuna pachas utjkänti.
That’s what it will need.	Ukaw ukax wakisini.
Who knows where it is.	Khitis kawkitsa yati.
You don’t want to do this at the moment.	Jumax janiw jichha pachanx uk lurañ munktati.
Almost, but not quite.	Niya, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
I didn’t know where.	Janiw kawkhans uk yatkayätti.
Why is there a .	Kunatsa mä .
He’s always on time.	Jupax sapa kutiw horasapar puri.
But something bad happened.	Ukampis mä jan waliw pasäna.
It’s a bad guy.	Mä jan wali jaqiwa.
But don’t forget yourself.	Ukampis juma pachpat jan armasimti.
That’s certainly the case with this.	Chiqpachansa aka tuqitxa ukhamawa.
He already said he loved her.	Jupajj niyaw jupar munasta sasin säna.
Very small, very flat.	Wali jisk’a, wali ch’uqi.
Let’s see how he goes.	Kunjamsa jupax saraski uk uñjañäni.
About yourself, too.	Juma pachpat, ukhamaraki.
But he didn't do that now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj ukham lurkänti.
Nice and smooth.	Suma ukat ch’uqi.
I finally realized why.	Kunatsa uk qhepat amuyasta.
I want to come here.	Nayax akan jutañ munta.
No, there is no time.	Janiwa, janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
You know, this is the day.	Jumax yatisktawa, aka urux wali ch’amawa.
It seems to be.	Ukhamaw uñjasi.
He did or didn't say anything.	Jupajj kuns luräna jan ukajj janiw siskänti.
He didn't speak for a while.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow jan arskänti.
Did you never know that.	¿Janipuniw uk yatkayätati.
It’s been yours for many years.	Walja maranakaw jumanakan utji.
I’ve always done that.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurawayta.
He doesn't quite know what to do.	Kuntï lurañapäki uk janiw sum amuykiti.
To me, he’s a stranger.	Nayatakix jupax mä jan uñt’at jaqiwa.
The last evening is long.	Qhipa jayp’ux wali jaya.
He started sleeping better at night.	Jupajj arumaw jukʼamp sum ikiñ qalltäna.
How much money do you need.	Qhawqha qullqis jumatakix wakisi.
He's known for that.	Jupax ukham uñt'atawa.
That’s what I’m worried about .	Uka tuqitxa nayax llakistwa .
Well, not really, actually.	Ukhama, janiw chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
He needs to do more of it.	Jupajj jukʼampiw ukanak lurañapa.
Every last word.	Sapa qhipa aru.
So he wanted to know more about her.	Ukhamajj jupat wal yatiñ munäna.
He loved her, yes.	Jupajj jupar wal munasïna, jïsa.
Will do the same for anyone.	Khitirus ukhamarakiw lurani.
You’ve been around for a long time.	Jumax wali jaya pachaw uka chiqanx jikxatasïta.
Eventually, he fell in love with her.	Qhepatjja, jupampiw wal munasïna.
I didn't know about you for a long time.	Walja tiempow jumat jan yatkayätti.
He had no idea it would happen here.	Jupajj janiw aka cheqan ukham pasañap amuykänti.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj wal munasi.
I want something like that.	Nayax ukham kuns munta.
Breakfast is more difficult.	Desayuno ukax juk’amp ch’amawa.
I didn't want to know.	Nayajj janiw yatiñ munkayätti.
But this is awesome!!.	Ukampis akax wali muspharkañawa!!.
That's the whole thing wrong.	Ukaw taqe jan walïki ukajja.
It will be nice and smooth.	Ukax wali suma ukat wali sumaw utjani.
I love going to the park.	Nayax parkin sarañax walpun munta.
This should be done weekly or bi-weekly.	Ukax sapa semana jan ukax sapa pä semanaw lurañapa.
The beer of the.	Uka cerveza ukaxa.
He didn't want to sleep alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak ikiñ munkänti.
When did this happen.	Kunapachas ukham pasäna.
So we have all the time tomorrow.	Ukhamajj qharürojj taqe tiempow utjistu.
It’s a real fool.	Chiqpach loqhe jaqiwa.
I like them a lot.	Nayajj jupanakar wal gustitu.
I know almost nothing.	Niya janiw kuns yatkti.
No one wanted to take the opportunity.	Janiw khitis uka oportunidad apsuñ munkänti.
I feel better here.	Nayax juk’amp sumaw akan jikxatastxa.
It did a pretty good job.	Ukajj wali sumwa luräna.
He knew nothing about her.	Jupajj janiw kuns jupat yatkänti.
I like you a lot.	Nayajj jumar wal gustitu.
I enjoyed my first year.	Nayrïr marax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
It was never the other way around.	Janipuniw yaqha tuqitxa ukhamäkänti.
Home, she thought.	Uta, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
He is speeding everything up.	Jupajj taqe kunsa jankʼakiw luraski.
He acted like he didn’t care.	Jupax janis kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamaw sarnaqäna.
Only three times larger.	Kimsa kutikiw jukʼamp jachʼa.
I have no idea why or how he does it.	Kunatsa jan ukajj kunjamsa uk luraski uk janiw amuykti.
He decided to do two things.	Jupajj pä lurañanak lurañatakiw amtäna.
It takes more than that.	Ukatakejj jukʼampiw munasispa.
I had reasons not to.	Nayajj jan ukham lurañatakejj kunatsa ukham lurayäta.
It is difficult to do anything.	Kun lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
I think he’s a wonderful teacher.	Nayax amuyta jupax wali suma yatichiriwa.
He’s funny and fascinating.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa ukat wali muspharkañawa.
He looked almost happy.	Jupax niya kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
I really want to stop drinking.	Chiqpachansa umañ jaytañ munta.
And he really didn’t want to go.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw sarañ munkänti.
They have a good breakfast too.	Jupanakax mä suma desayuno ukhamaraki.
He lived there very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa ukan jakasïna.
He is doing it a lot.	Jupajj walpun uk luraski.
I really like doing it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw lurañax gustitu.
Of course, that would be a good thing.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañax wali askïspawa.
I definitely think so.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw amuyta.
He doesn’t want to work.	Jupax janiw irnaqañ munkiti.
I listen to it at least once a day.	Urun mä kutis istʼta.
Don’t make this a bad thing, because it’s not.	Janiw akax jan walïkiti, kunatix janiw ukhamäkiti.
And it really doesn’t matter.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kunäkisa.
That’s who he is now.	Ukhamaw jichhajj khitïnsa.
He was short, thin.	Jupajj jiskʼa, jiskʼa jaqënwa.
I’m sure it did.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham luratayna.
This is a light.	Akax mä qhanawa.
He very rarely does that.	Jupax wali juk’akiw ukham luraski.
He looked so small and lonely.	Jupajj wali jiskʼa ukat sapakiw uñnaqäna.
Or the last time.	Jan ukajj qhep qhepa kuti.
Not bad, he thinks.	Janiw jan walïkiti, sasaw jupax amuyi.
The morning is beautiful and quiet.	Alwax wali sumawa ukat amukiw jikxatasi.
I knew nothing about him before that.	Uka nayrajj janiw jupat kuns yatkti.
Good, but not great.	Suma, ukampis janiw jach’a jach’a.
I love this and it really got to me.	Nayax akax walpun munasta ukat chiqpachans nayaruw puri.
But he’s alone.	Ukampis jupax sapakiw jikxatasi.
Or it's okay.	Jan ukajj walikïskiwa.
That’s how it went.	Ukhamaw saräna.
That’s the only thing he has.	Uka sapakiw jupax utji.
This is obvious.	Ukax qhanaw amuyasi.
How can this happen?.	¿Kunjamatsa ukajj pasaspa?.
That’s what I want to know about it.	Ukaw uka tuqit yatiñ munta.
He loves it so much.	Jupajj wal muni.
He learned how to do it well.	Kunjamsa sum lurañ yateqäna.
In fact, I wonder if that is not the case.	Chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jisktʼasta.
He left the same day.	Jupajj uka pachpa uruw sarjjäna.
You have to build a house.	Mä uta lurañamawa.
He didn't know how long he stayed there.	Qhawqha tiempos ukan qheparäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Not big or small.	Janiw jach’a jan jisk’a.
But that's just how it is.	Ukampis ukajj ukhamakiw utji.
They already know.	Jupanakax niyaw yatipxi.
What is the area?.	¿Kunas uka chiqanx utji?.
I need some sleep, that’s all.	Nayax mä juk’a ikiñ munta, ukakiw.
Ten years later .	Tunka mara qhepatjja .
They are rare, they are very rare.	Jupanakax juk’akiw utji, jupanakax wali juk’akiw utji.
Everything is fine, he seemed to say.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa, sasaw jupax siskäna ukhama.
Money was scarce.	Qullqix juk’akiw utjäna.
I only need one.	Nayax mä sapakiw munasta.
Such an awesome day!.	¡Ukham wali muspharkañ uru!.
I’m good at the first two.	Nayax nayrïr pä tuqitx sum yatxatasta.
It’s really cool,.	Chiqpachansa wali ch’amawa,.
It wasn't what he wanted right now.	Janiw kunjamtï jichhajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
He rarely stayed too long.	Jupajj jukʼakiw sinti jaya tiempo qheparäna.
I decided to stay there for the day.	Ukan uru qhiparañ amtawayta.
I haven’t done anything yet.	Janiw jichhakamax kuns lurkti.
He knew that was not in the future.	Jupajj janiw jutïrin ukajj utjkaniti uk sum yatïna.
And very strongly about it.	Ukat wali ch’amampiw uka tuqitxa.
It would have done very well.	Wali sum luraspäna.
Everything is amazing, and .	Taqi kunas muspharkañawa, ukat .
He doesn’t have anyone.	Jupax janiw khitis utjkiti.
He gave it to her as a gift.	Jupajj ukanak mä regalo ukham jupar churäna.
But he is the only one.	Ukampis jupa sapakiw jikxatasi.
I think he didn’t want to go.	Nayax amuyta, jupax janiw sarañ munkänti.
He is the one who is in trouble.	Jupaw jan walin uñjasi.
If he wanted to.	Jupajj munäna ukhajja.
So it doesn't matter to me.	Ukhamajj janiw nayatakejj wakiskiti.
That’s what he wanted to see, too.	Ukhamaw jupax uñjañ munäna, ukhamaraki.
Last day of school.	Yatiqañ utan qhipa uru.
But it doesn't matter, it would be good.	Ukampis janiw kunäkisa, ukajj wali askïspawa.
There is no such thing.	Ukanjja, janiw ukajj utjkiti.
But it happened many times.	Ukampis walja kutiw ukham pasäna.
I think everyone knows that now.	Jichhax taqiniw uk yatipxi sasaw amuyta.
It was very quiet the whole time.	Taqi uka tiempox wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
I'm still hungry.	Nayax wali manq'at awtjataw jikxatastxa.
No one is really interesting, and for that matter.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapunix wali askïkiti, ukat uka tuqitxa.
Eventually, he says.	Qhepatjja, sasaw saraki.
He’s going to go there.	Jupax ukaruw sarxani.
Eventually, he realizes the truth.	Qhepatjja, kunatï cheqäki uk amuyasi.
I can’t say for sure right now.	Jichhax janiw chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
And most of all he’s a nice guy.	Ukat taqi kunat sipansa jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
He’d really like to see you there.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukan uñjañ munasma.
These can last for decades.	Ukanakax tunka maranakaw utjaspa.
But he didn't understand anything.	Ukampis janiw kuns amuyaskänti.
You will need one of these.	Ukanakat mayniw munasini.
Well, that’s what happened.	Ukhama, ukham pasäna.
He had just about everything.	Jupajj niya taqe kunaw utjäna.
It’s going to take some time.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw sarañapa.
Yes, he’s very happy.	Jïsa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
It doesn’t exist alone.	Janiw sapakix utjkiti.
And he couldn't do anything with her.	Ukat janiw jupamp kuns lurkaspänti.
He rarely left his home.	Jupajj jukʼakiw utapat sarjjäna.
So it's fine by me.	Ukhamajj nayat sipansa walikïskiwa.
Attendance is cautious.	Uka tantachäwir sarañax wali amuyumpiw utji.
Let’s see things how.	Kunanakas kunjamatsa uk uñjañäni.
But really anyone could do that.	Ukampis chiqpachansa khitis ukham luraspäna.
I know you don’t want to talk to me.	Nayax yattwa jumax janiw nayamp parlañ munktati.
I think it’s time to go.	Nayax sarañ pachaw purini sasaw amuyta.
Interestingly, this was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
He could have done that yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw ukham luraspäna.
I think he wants to get home.	Nayax amuyta, jupax utar puriñ muni.
So you never want that to happen.	Ukhamajj janipuniw ukham lurasiñap munktati.
Of course, other than that, it wasn't.	Chiqansa, yaqha tuqitxa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
We went very early in the morning.	Wali alwat sarapjjta.
If you want to get involved, do it.	Jumatix ukar mantañ munsta ukhax lurañamawa.
I don’t really think that’s the case for me.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
Kind of a smug word, too.	Mä kasta jach’a jach’a tukuñ aru, ukhamaraki.
Of course, it doesn’t exist here.	Chiqansa, janiw akax utjkiti.
I decided immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw amtawayta.
Small and large.	Jisk’a jisk’a ukat jach’a.
That told me two things.	Ukaw pä tuqit yatiyäna.
And he loves me more.	Ukat jupax nayaruw jukʼamp munasi.
I went alone.	Mä sapakiw sarawayta.
Heat and humidity are important.	Junt’u ukat thaya ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
He was, of course.	Jupax ukhamänwa, chiqpachansa.
It is as .	Ukajj kunjamtï .
It looks great and feels great.	Ukax wali jach’a uñtatawa ukat wali sumaw jikxatasi.
But it didn't feel pretty.	Ukampis janiw suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
That lasted two years.	Ukajj pä maraw utjäna.
It was loved badly.	Ukax jan waliw munasïna.
Everyone will have money.	Taqinipuniw qullqix utjani.
I only did it once or twice.	Mä kuti jan ukajj pä kutikiw uk lurayäta.
You do what you want to do.	Jumaw kuntï lurañ munkta uk lurasma.
Today I ride ten.	Jichhürunakanxa tunka munta.
No one knew how to help him.	Janiw khitis jupar yanaptʼañ yatkänti.
A strange, fascinating, and yet unique book.	Mä muspharkañ, wali muspharkañ, ukat ukampis jan uñt’at libro.
I’m almost at night.	Niya arumaw purini.
I don’t know why, but they don’t know.	Janiw kunatsa uk yatkti, ukampis janiw yatipkiti.
And you know what.	Ukat jumax yatisktawa kunas uk.
As usual, he was safe.	Kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I don’t know if he actually saw one.	Cheqapunit mä uñjäna janicha uk janiw yatkti.
It’s always in the same place all the time.	Ukax sapa kutiw pachpa chiqan sapa kuti utji.
That’s what happened.	Ukhamaw ukax pasäna.
I had a party.	Nayajj mä fiesta lurayäta.
Hence the following question.	Ukatwa aka jisktʼajj utji.
I finally asked him what he thought.	Qhepatjja, kunsa amuyi uk jisktʼta.
So he doesn’t .	Ukhamajj jupajj janiw .
He said he wanted to live with her again.	Ukat wasitat jupamp jakañ munta sasaw säna.
The length of time he shook her.	Kuna jaya tiempos jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
And that’s what’s hard for me.	Ukat ukax nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
Do this once a day or every other day.	Urun mä kuti jan ukax sapa pä uru ukham lurañama.
He must do so immediately.	Jankʼakiw ukham lurañapa.
He tried hard to stay home.	Jupajj utan qheparañ wal chʼamachasïna.
That's what it says.	Ukhamaw kuntï siski ukajja.
He’s just so cool.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali thaya.
And I choked myself.	Ukat naya pachpaw chʼalljjtayasïna.
Fortunately, though, it's a valid question.	Ukampis wali askiwa, uka jisktʼajj wali askiwa.
I love it and he doesn’t.	Nayax walpun munasta ukat jupax janiw walïkiti.
We will do better.	Jiwasajj jukʼamp sum lurañäni.
I really feel that sincerely.	Chiqpachansa wali taqi chuymaw ukham amuyasta.
But he didn't know exactly where to go.	Ukampis kawkirus sarañapa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
It’s pretty cool, and it’s cool, like that.	Ukax wali ch’amawa, ukat wali ch’amawa, ukhama.
And the young man.	Ukat uka waynax.
They don't really know what he did.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk janiw cheqpachapun yatipkiti.
I’m not sure how long it can last.	Nayax janiw qhawqha tiempos ukax utjaspa ukx yatkti.
It will be a little less.	Ukax mä juk’a juk’akiw utjani.
I find that to be a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa uñjta.
There will be no room here tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw mä cuarto akan utjkaniti.
Except it doesn’t work.	Jan ukasti janiw irnaqkiti.
He did nothing for me.	Jupajj janiw nayatakejj kuns lurkänti.
Wrong, everything is wrong.	Jan wali, taqi kunas jan wali.
It was all he wanted.	Ukajj taqe kuntï jupajj munkäna ukawa.
These know better.	Ukanakax jukʼamp sum yatipxi.
I’m still hungry.	Nayax wali manq’at awtjataw jikxatasiyäta.
The details are as follows:	Uka tuqitxa akham siwa:
Do it right the first time.	Nayrïr kutin sum lurañamawa.
I think you agree with me though.	Nayax amuyta jumax nayamp iyaw satawa ukampis.
This bodes well for the future.	Ukax jutïr pachax wali sumaw sañ muni.
It started out so well.	Ukham sum qalltäna.
Anyway, this is what happened.	Kawkhansa, akax kunas pasäna.
It’s a quiet place.	Ukax amukiw jikxatasi.
Let's see how that works out.	Kunjamsa ukajj jikjjatasi uk uñjañäni.
They told me no.	Jupanakajj janiw sasaw sapjjetäna.
You have to work hard to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj wal chʼamachasiñama.
We just have to, let’s be honest about it.	Jiwasax ukhamakiw lurañasa, uka tuqitx chiqapar uñjañäni.
There was one.	Mä ukaw utjäna.
But there is this question.	Ukampis aka jisktʼajj utji.
But no one knows what happened this time.	Ukampis kunas aka kutin pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
The morning is still bright.	Alwajj wali qhanawa.
An old house.	Mä nayra uta.
But no, really, this is really interesting.	Ukampis janiw, chiqpachansa, akax chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
But he is moving too fast.	Ukampis jupax wali jankʼakiw sarnaqaski.
Something’s very hot.	Kunas wali junt’u.
He feels worthy.	Jupajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasi.
Maybe too good.	Inas sinti suma.
He went back to his house.	Jupajj wasitatwa utapar kuttʼjjäna.
I like him more every time.	Nayax juparux sapa kutiw juk’amp munasta.
You absolutely have to tell him.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw jupar yatiyañama.
I would love to do that.	Ukham lurañajj nayatakejj wali askïspawa.
That's what he does with me.	Ukhamaw jupajj nayamp chika luri.
You know that means very little to me.	Jumax yatisktawa ukax nayatakix wali juk’akiw sañ muni.
Now it’s bad.	Jichhax jan wali.
That in itself is enough.	Ukajj jupa pachpajj walikïskiwa.
He didn't do that for any reason.	Janiw kunatsa ukham lurkänti.
You think everything is clear.	Jumax taqi kunas qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
I kind of let it go.	Nayax mä juk’a jaytawayta.
Now many times more.	Jichhax walja kutiw juk’ampi.
I just realized that day.	Jichhakiw uka urux amuyasta.
I thought he was perfect for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
I like that big boy a lot.	Uka jach’a waynax walpun gustitu.
Twice or more.	Pä kuti jan ukax juk’ampi.
No one had any idea what to do.	Kun lurañas wakisispa uk janiw khitis amuykänti.
I have no idea what’s next for us.	Kunas jiwasatak jutïrin utjani uk janiw amuykti.
Anything, everything, nothing.	Kunas, taqi kunas, janiw kunas.
There is no need to do anything about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurañax wakiskiti.
I don't want to say that right now.	Janiw jichhajj ukham sañ munkti.
He repeats it again and again.	Jupax wasitat wasitat arsu.
He told me what it was.	Jupaw kunas uk sitäna.
You’ll be too happy.	Jumax sinti kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
But that's OK, though.	Ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa, ukampis.
To be honest, he was a little disappointed.	Chiqpachansa, jupax mä jukʼa llakitaw jikxatasïna.
I want to buy a car soon.	Nayax jank’akiw mä auto alañ munta.
I don’t know where to ride.	Janiw kawkirus kayuk sarañ yatkti.
I only want to do it once.	Mä kutikiw uk lurañ munta.
Now do the right thing.	Jichhajj kunatï cheqäki uk lurañamawa.
You doubt me.	Jumax nayat pächasta.
Too many perhaps.	Sinti walja inas.
He was devastated, sad.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
We have a very .	Jiwasax mä wali .
He said, that’s not the point.	Jupax sänwa, janiw ukax uka tuqitxa.
It’s still beautiful today.	Jichhürunakanxa wali sumawa.
So far, no one has figured it out.	Jichhakamax janiw khitis uk amuykiti.
And a car.	Ukat mä auto.
Too lonely or something.	Sinti sapaki jan ukax kunas.
I did that, yeah.	Nayax uk lurawayta, jïsa.
And now it wasn't.	Ukat jichhajj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But we don't have it.	Ukampis janiw jiwasajj utjkiti.
That means everyone everywhere.	Ukax taqiniw taqi chiqan sañ muni.
Cold and water.	Thaya ukat uma.
Right here and here.	Chiqaw akan ukat akan.
And I can’t stand it, really.	Ukat janiw aguantañjamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
That’s more every year.	Ukax sapa maraw juk’ampi.
Therefore, it is not necessary to do so.	Ukatwa jan ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
But it’s not all you can do.	Ukampis janiw taqe kun lurañjamäkiti.
They were in a state of shock.	Jupanakajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He said he wouldn’t go far.	Janiw jaya sarkäti sasaw säna.
He’s above all else.	Jupax taqi kunat sipansa.
It hasn’t gone away yet.	Janiw jichhakamax sarkiti.
He knew it, he knew it.	Jupax uk yatïna, jupax uk yatïna.

I want to see what happens.	Kunas pasani uk uñjañ munta.
I know how to use it.	Nayajj ukanak apnaqañ yatta.
I know it’s in there somewhere.	Nayax yattwa ukax ukanx kawkhans utji.
But he didn't want to do anything wrong.	Ukampis janiw jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
I’ve been feeling that way.	Nayax ukham jikxatasiyäta.
Couldn’t have done it any other way.	Janiw yaqha tuqit lurkaspänti.
I didn’t want to deny him.	Janiw jupar jan iyaw sañ munkayätti.
It is much better in this respect.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼamp askiwa.
He was such a great guy.	Ukham jachʼa jaqënwa.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj nayar wal munäna.
Now tell me what to do tonight.	Jichhax kuns aka arumax lurañax uk yatiyapxita.
Do you know about that?.	¿Uka tuqit yattati?.
He’s the first to arrive.	Jupaw nayraqat puri.
It’s hard if you want to quit already.	Ukax ch’amawa, jumatix nayratpach jaytañ munsta ukhaxa.
He wants her to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañapatakiw muni.
And one was very bad.	Ukat maynix wali jan waliw utjäna.
Because we don’t need that, we really don’t need it.	Kunatix jiwasax janiw ukax wakiskiti, chiqpachansa janiw wakiskiti.
Now that would be interesting.	Jichhajj ukajj wali askïspawa.
Thirty years later, that is not the case.	Kimsa tunka mara qhepatjja, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He's doing something.	Jupajj kunsa luri.
I am clear about that.	Uka tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasta.
I mean that kind of stuff.	Nayax uka kasta yänak sañ munta.
We’ll see him one night.	Jiwasax mä arumaw juparux uñjañäni.
Ten dollars per week.	Tunka qullqi sapa semana.
You will feel more in love.	Jumax jukʼamp munasiñampiw jikxatasïta.
I am going again.	Nayajj wasitatwa saraskta.
Everywhere now.	Taqi tuqit jichhax.
A good eye was a gift.	Mä suma nayrax mä regalo ukhamänwa.
She thought he wanted her.	Jupaw jupar munäna sasaw amuyäna.
But we will do it soon.	Ukampis niyaw lurañäni.
Of course, this is something that needs to be done.	Chiqansa, ukax mä lurañaw wakisi.
He’s a wonderfully tough guy.	Jupax wali muspharkañ qhuru jaqiwa.
Only once is what he told me.	Mä kutikiw kuntï jupax sitäna ukawa.
I think it’s fine, whatever.	Nayax wali suma amuyta, kunas.
I like it when that happens.	Kunapachatï ukham luraski ukhajj nayatakejj wal gustitu.
And he rolled his eyes at me.	Ukat jupax nayaruw nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
It doesn’t feel bad.	Janiw jan walinak amuykiti.
And that's all he did.	Ukat ukakiw jupajj luräna.
He never existed before.	Jupajj janipuniw nayrajj utjkänti.
I still haven’t seen it.	Nayax wali jan uñjkti.
So then no one goes well with anyone.	Ukhama ukat janiw khitis khitimpis sum sarkiti.
Warm, so warm.	Junt’u, ukhama junt’u.
It’s a red giant.	Ukax mä wila jach’a jaqiwa.
I never thought anything about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet kunsa amuykayätti.
No one told him what to do.	Janiw khitis kuns lurañapatak siskänti.
Like he did some work.	Kunjamtï jupax mä jukʼa lurañanak lurkäna ukhama.
He’s slowing down.	Jupax juk’ampi juk’ampi juk’ampi.
I don't remember any more.	Janiw juk'amp amtaskti.
And if anyone saw him, .	Ukat khitis jupar uñjäna ukhajja, .
Everything is silent.	Taqi kunas amukiw utji.
I don’t know why he did that.	Janiw kunatsa ukham luräna uk yatkti.
He was really mean, and I had no choice.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jan wali jaqënwa, janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
I think this is all good.	Nayax amuyta akax taqi kunas wali askiwa.
He sees the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk uñji.

But he doesn't want to talk to her.	Ukampis janiw jupamp parltʼañ munkiti.
You’ll only get one.	Mä sapakiw jikxatasïta.
It takes a lot of time.	Walja tiempow munasispa.
I am so very happy with that.	Nayajj ukham wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He was doing worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak luraskäna.
He knew that this was not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
It seemed so mature.	Ukajj wali jilïr jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
No one really knows exactly why.	Kunatsa uk janiw khitis chiqpachapuni sum yatkiti.
He’s just so fierce.	Jupax ukhamakiw wali qhuru jaqiwa.
He needed more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munasïna.
Of course, he doesn't want to see it that way.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham uñjañ munkiti.
All kinds and many.	Taqi kasta ukat walja.
Eventually, he thought.	Qhepatjja, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
Still can't quite believe it.	Wali jan sum iyaw sañjamäkiti.
What’s going on here.	Kunas akanx utji.
That’s what the guy gave her.	Ukaw uka waynax jupar churäna.
Because, that’s all that matters.	Kunatix, ukakiw wakisi.
And he lived with her.	Ukat jupamp chikaw jakasïna.
I thought that meant something else.	Ukajj yaqha sañ muni sasaw amuyayäta.
I never knew what to do.	Janipuniw kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
This is really exciting for me.	Akax chiqpachansa nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
It’s financially difficult.	Qullqi tuqitxa wali ch’amawa.
Hers alone seemed beautiful.	Jupan sapakiw wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
He just knew how to do it.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk lurañ yatïna, ukakiw utjäna.
It’s the better of the two.	Ukax pä tuqitx juk’amp askiwa.
In fact, he loved her.	Chiqansa, juparux walpun munäna.
I never wanted to give it up.	Janipuniw uk jaytañ munkayätti.
All of these are very familiar to me.	Taqi ukanakax nayatakix wali uñt’atawa.
One day this, one day that.	Mä urux aka, mä urux uka.
He said it was big and beautiful.	Jupax jach’a ukat wali sumaw sasaw säna.
He knows he can't do it.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañjamäkiti, uk sum yati.
And there was no reason.	Ukat janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
I really do know.	Chiqpachansa yattwa.
I want to do that now.	Jichhajj ukham lurañ munta.
There is nothing, it is not good.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, janiw askïkiti.
It’s really cool, you know.	Chiqpachansa wali sumawa, jumax yatisktawa.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t.	Muspharkañawa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
Everything was grand and beautiful back then.	Uka tiemponjja, taqe kunas wali jachʼa ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
He made a good comeback.	Jupajj wali sumwa kuttʼjjäna.
Someone mentioned this injustice.	Maynix uka jan chiqapar uñjañ tuqitx arsüna.
And this is exactly what it’s about.	Ukat akax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqitxa.
Nearly a decade later, let's see where things are.	Niya tunka mara qhepatjja, kawkhansa kunas utji uk uñjañäni.
It’s time to admit something.	Kuns iyaw sañ pachaw purini.
John said that.	Juanajj uk sänwa.
But I don't mind that.	Ukampis janiw ukajj nayajj jan walïkiti.
I personally find this very strange.	Naya pachpaw ukajj wali muspharkañ jikjjatasta.
He didn’t know what all.	Jupax janiw yatkänti kunas taqi.
Not a good question enough.	Janiw mä suma jisktʼajj wakiskiti.
A very long time.	Mä wali jaya tiempo.
After all, he knew the rules.	Chiqansa, jupax kamachinak sum yatïna.
A half-cent.	Mä chikat qullqi.
It doesn't matter why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
But really, that doesn’t matter.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Bloody, ugly, but worth it.	Wila, jan wali, ukampis wali askiwa.
That’s where it’s going.	Ukaw kawkirus saraski.
There is no truth in it.	Ukanjja, kunatï cheqäki ukajj janiw utjkiti.
He didn't want to believe it.	Janiw iyaw sañ munkänti.
Small and beautiful.	Jisk’a ukat suma.
But he didn't know nearly as well.	Ukampis janiw niya ukham sum yatkänti.
I thought he wanted to quit.	Jupajj jaytañ muni sasaw amuyayäta.
I really like that a lot.	Chiqpachansa ukax walpun gustitu.
I wonder who it could be.	Khitis ukajj utjaspa sasaw jisktʼasta.
And that’s why you feel that way.	Ukat ukax kunatsa ukham jikxatastaxa.
I see the moon.	Nayax phaxsin uñjta.
I’m thinking yes.	Nayax jïsa sasaw amuyta.
He gave me a letter.	Jupajj mä carta churitu.
That is never a bad thing.	Ukajj janipuniw jan walïkiti.
I went to bed there.	Ukan ikiñar sarawayta.
I needed to do more than one thing.	Mä lurañat sipansa jukʼamp lurañaw wakisïna.
What you did to him.	Kuntï jumajj jupar lurkta ukjja.
He appreciates both.	Jupajj panpachaniw wali askit uñji.
If that’s all I care about.	Ukakiw nayatakix wali askïspa ukhaxa.
When one knows, everyone knows.	Kunapachatï maynix yati ukhaxa, taqiniw yatipxi.
That is what happened to me.	Ukhamaw nayampejj pasäna.
I’ve never had this happen before.	Nayax janiw nayrax ukham lurañax utjkitänti.
Tell me about it tonight.	Jichha arumax uka tuqit yatiyapxita.
And another year at home.	Ukat yaqha maraw utan jikxatasïna.
It’s the best thing ever.	Taqi kunat sipansa wali sumawa.
You can do both at the same time.	Panpachaniw mä pachan lurasma.
I hope tomorrow will be a little better.	Qhipürux mä juk’a sumaw utjani sasaw suyt’askta.
It’s hard for me.	Nayatakix ch’amawa.
That’s exactly what it all looks like.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw taqpach uñtasi.
And there is nothing anyone can do.	Ukat janiw kunas khitis lurkaspati.
Well he might.	Suma jupax inas.
It was all happening at the same time.	Taqi ukanak mä pachan luraskäna.
But you know, I really understand.	Ukampis jumax yatisktawa, chiqpachapuniw amuyasta.
He did mention her to me, just once.	Jupajj cheqapuniw nayarojj jupat parläna, mä kutikiw jupat parläna.
I think work is better.	Trabajo lurañajj jukʼamp askiwa sasaw amuyta.
I think you like him.	Nayax amuyta, jumax jupar munasma.
He plans to stay a few days.	Jupax mä qawqha urunak qhiparañ amti.
So not much or a problem.	Ukhamajj janiw sinti ni mä jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
We’ll do it one night.	Jiwasax mä arumaw lurañäni.
No one does anything on their own.	Janiw khitis jupa pachpa kuns lurkiti.
Which they are not.	Ukax jupanakax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But I said that was not the case.	Ukampis nayajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw sista.
I don’t want that stuff.	Nayax janiw uka yänak munkti.
It doesn’t do too much damage.	Janiw sinti jan walinak lurkiti.
Yes, he knows a lot about it.	Jïsa, jupajj uka toqet wal yati.
He wanted to know, but he didn't.	Jupajj yatiñwa munäna, ukampis janiw uk yatkänti.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Janiw kunas sañ munkiti.
They are pretty good though.	Jupanakax wali sumaw ukampis.
Or maybe he’s .	Jan ukajj inas jupajj .
But you still understand.	Ukampis jumax wali sum amuyta.
That was what it was all about.	Ukaw taqe kunas uka toqet parläna.
But you have to make the effort to do so.	Ukampis ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
He had said sincerely before.	Jupajj nayrajj taqe chuymaw säna.
Or you have to do that.	Jan ukajj jumajj ukham lurañamawa.
But he didn't, he knew it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti, jupajj uk sum yatïna.
And it always will be.	Ukat sapa kutiw utjani.

He said that .	Jupax akham sänwa .
Never, not once.	Janipuniw, janiw mä kutis ukhamäkiti.
It’s not good enough now.	Jichhax janiw askïkiti.
Of course there was nothing here.	Chiqansa janiw kunas akan utjkänti.
He can do it quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk luraspa.
It’s a snowflake.	Ukax mä ch’uqi ch’uqi satawa.
I don't like it very much.	Nayajj janiw wali askïkiti.
You’re half-starved.	Jumax chikat manq’at awtjataw jikxatastaxa.
I don't like all of that.	Nayajj janiw taqe ukanakajj gustkituti.
What is real is not impossible.	Kunatï cheqpachapun utjki ukajj janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He doesn't want her.	Jupajj janiw jupar munkiti.
They don’t know enough.	Jupanakax janiw sum yatipkiti.
And this was the best.	Ukat akax wali sumapunïnwa.
Of course you know this by now.	Chiqpachansa jumax jichhakamax uk yatisktawa.
That’s what does it for me.	Ukaw nayatakix uk luraski.
At least not like me.	Ukhamajj nayat sipansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
Today he lives that way.	Jichhürunakanxa jupax ukham jakasi.
I'm worried about that now.	Jichhax uka tuqitxa llakistwa.
He takes care of the place.	Jupaw uka cheqar uñji.
But he is still in a state of shock.	Ukampis jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasi.
I'm waiting for it.	Nayax suyt'twa.
But all of this took a long time.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj walja tiempow munasïna.
No, he didn't say that.	Janiwa, janiw ukham siskänti.
I don’t want to take it, ever again.	Janiw apsuñ munkti, janipuniw mayampsa.
It’s hard, it’s hard to do.	Ukax ch’amawa, lurañax ch’amawa.
But I do feel that way.	Ukampis nayajj ukham amuyasta.
Maybe one or two more.	Inas mä jan ukax pä juk’ampi.
And that is what is happening.	Ukat ukajj ukhamarakiw pasaski.
I think it’s both.	Nayax panpachaniw amuyta.
He’s there every single year.	Jupax sapa sapa maraw ukan utji.
He will love you.	Jupajj jumaruw munasini.
That was the best part of it all.	Ukaw taqe kunat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa.
For a long time no one said anything.	Walja tiempojj janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
I’m afraid it’s too cold.	Nayax axsaratwa wali thaya.

There was no one but me.	Janiw khitis nayat sipan utjkänti.
There is night light.	Ukanx arumax qhanaw utji.
There is no food.	Janiw manq'añax utjkiti.
He did this relatively well.	Ukjja mä jukʼa sumwa luräna.
I don’t like it, at all.	Nayatakix janiw wali askïkiti, janipuniw.
There may never be another opportunity.	Inas janipuniw yaqha oportunidad utjkaspati.
And what should you tell them? 	Ukat ¿kunsa jupanakar yatiyañama?
And it was .	Ukat ukhamänwa .
He seemed to be all human.	Jupajj taqe jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
It took time.	Tiempow wakisïna.
He agreed to all of this.	Jupajj taqe ukanak iyaw sänwa.
I could never figure it out.	Janipuniw uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
And they actually happened.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukanakaw pasäna.
He planned the first day .	Jupax nayrïr uru amtawayi .
That’s definitely the guy.	Chiqpachansa ukax uka jaqiwa.
I’m here to make this better.	Nayax akax juk’amp sum lurañatakiw akanktxa.
But he didn't want to go anywhere else.	Ukampis janiw yaqha cheqar sarañ munkänti.
I love her so much!!!.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta!!!.
One day or another.	Mä uru jan ukajj mä uru.
I want to be honest.	Nayajj cheqpach arsuñ munta.
And what he could do about it.	Ukat kunsa jupajj uka toqet luraspäna.
It was such a new morning.	Ukham machaq alwaw utjäna.
This is obvious.	Akax qhanawa.
I was surprised to hear that.	Ukham sasin istʼasajj wal muspharta.
He is not there.	Jupajj janiw ukan utjkiti.
She is a terrible woman.	Jupax wali axsarkañ warmiwa.
But he means nothing to me.	Ukampis jupajj nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
She wants to tell him everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupar yatiyañ muni.
We’ll have some good hours now.	Jichhax mä qawqha suma horanakaw utjani.
So there was no need to do anything.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna lurañas wakiskänti.
But now things are serious.	Ukampis jichhajj kunanakas wali wakiskiriwa.
Why do you want to do that?.	¿Kunatsa ukham lurañ munta?.
There are no two sides.	Janiw pä tuqit utjkiti.
Because we’ve got some .	Kunatix jiwasax mä juk’a .
He turned back to them again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupanakar kuttʼjjäna.
This really doesn’t work well.	Chiqpachansa akax janiw sum irnaqkiti.
But something had to be done.	Ukampis mä lurañaw wakisïna.
But this is a one-time thing.	Ukampis ukajj mä kutikiw lurañapa.
This has been the case in the past.	Nayrajj ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
And he gave me that permission.	Ukat jupaw uka permiso churitu.
He cannot be safe from us.	Jupajj janiw jiwasan jan kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
And it’s great.	Ukat jach’a.
Something is not working properly.	Kunas janiw sum irnaqkiti.
But it’s impossible .	Ukampis janiw lurañjamäkiti .
He knew exactly what we were going to do.	Jupajj kunsa lurañäni uk sum yatïna.
Just what he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna ukhama.
It wasn’t like we were.	Janiw jiwasajj ukhamäkänti.
He is going to be a good man.	Jupax wali suma jaqiruw saraski.
It’s surprisingly delicious!.	¡Ukax muspharkañ wali sumawa!.
I think that’s all.	Nayax ukakiw sasaw amuyta.
No one here knows who he is.	Aka chiqanx janiw khitis khitïnsa uk yatkiti.
This is one of them.	Akax mä.
These are mixed in appearance.	Ukanakax mistuñ uñnaqaniwa.
He repeatedly refused.	Jupajj walja kutiw jan munkänti.
So glad to see you.	Ukhamajj jumar uñjasajj wal kusista.
Fortunately, someone did.	Wali askiwa, maynix ukham luratayna.
Of course, he didn't know much about it.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw uka tuqit sum yatkänti.
And you need both.	Ukat panpachaniw munasispa.
You can’t have everything right now.	Jichhax janiw taqi kunas utjkaspati.
Yeah, yeah, that would be better.	Jïsa, jïsa, ukajj jukʼamp askïspawa.
Maybe one day we will.	Inas mä urux ukham lurañäni.
But everything was very quiet.	Ukampis taqe kunas wali amukiw utjäna.
What if that happens at the moment.	Kunas ukax jichha pachanx pasaspa.
There was never a question too small or too serious.	Janipuniw mä jiskʼa jan ukajj sinti jachʼa jisktʼajj utjkänti.
It doesn’t work in any way.	Janiw kuna tuqitsa irnaqkiti.
Before then, perhaps.	Janïr uka tiempon paskäna ukhajja, inas.
The guy worked hard.	Uka waynax wali ch’amampiw irnaqäna.
Someone will get to you very soon!.	¡Maynix wali jank’akiw jumar purini!.
He got what he needed.	Kuntï wakiski uk katoqäna.
We of course, you know.	Jiwasax chiqpachansa, jumax yatisktawa.
I would definitely stay again.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw wasitat qhiparañ munta.
Instead, he told her where he was.	Jan ukasti kawkinkis uk yatiyäna.
But there is a better way to do it.	Ukampis jukʼamp suma lurañaw utji.
Today, it’s different.	Jichhürunakanxa, yaqha.
He had clearly never done this before.	Jupajj janiw nayrajj uk lurkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
That never works.	Ukax janipuniw lurkiti.
He knows a lot of things.	Jupax walja yänak yati.
I love that, actually.	Nayax ukax walpun munta, chiqpachansa.
There was never a chance.	Janipuniw mä oportunidad utjkänti.
But above all, he knew it.	Ukampis taqe ukanakat sipansa, jupajj uk sum yatïna.
He went away alone.	Jupajj sapakiw sarjjäna.
He couldn't do anything.	Janiw jupajj kuns lurkaspänti.
They have nothing better to do.	Jupanakajj janiw jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkiti.
Don’t stop watching it.	Janiw uk uñjañ jaytañamäkiti.
He did it alone.	Sapakiw uk luräna.
So I guess he means it.	Ukhamajj jupajj uk sañ muni sasaw amuyta.
Why should he do that? 	¿Kunatsa ukham lurañapa?
And the implications are clear.	Ukat kuntï sañ munki ukajj qhanawa.
But now he wanted nothing more.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp munkänti.
The price is very important.	Uka qullqix wali wakiskiriwa.
Maybe twenty or thirty years.	Inas pä tunka jan ukax kimsa tunka mara.
There is another place.	Yaqha chiqaw utji.
He’s going to love this.	Jupax akax walpun munasini.
No one knows what is about to happen.	Kunas niyaw pasani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I didn’t want all of that.	Janiw ukanak taqe kunsa munkayätti.
That’s what he came for.	Ukaw jupajj jutäna.
I think that’s something.	Nayax ukax mä kunaw sasaw amuyta.
They didn't like it all that much.	Jupanakajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa gustkänti.
I saw him last week, twice.	Nayax juparux pasïr semanaw uñjta, pä kutiw uñjta.
So it's still.	Ukhamajj wali.
I’m always curious about it.	Nayax sapa kutiw uka tuqit yatxatañ munta.
About what it means .	Kunas sañ muni uka tuqitxa .
I don’t think so.	Janiw nayax ukham amuykti.
You have to do the same thing.	Uka pachpa lurañamawa.
One last cigar too.	Mä qhipa cigarro ukhamaraki.
But he wanted to know.	Ukampis uk yatiñwa munäna.
I’ve just done that.	Nayax ukhamakiw ukham lurawayta.
But he is the best of all.	Ukampis jupax taqi kunat sipansa wali suma jaqiwa.
He can do it himself.	Jupa pachpaw luraspa.

You’ll definitely get it.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw jikxatasïta.
I want to do more.	Nayax juk’amp lurañ munta.
I want some of that.	Nayax ukat mä juk’a munta.
I don’t know how to talk to you.	Janiw jumamp parlañ yatkti.
He says it’s been about a week now.	Jupax siwa, niya mä semanaw jichhax.
Will definitely do this again!.	Chiqpachansa akax wasitat lurani!.
He wanted something bigger.	Jupajj jukʼamp jachʼa lurañwa munäna.

Everything is beautiful and .	Taqi kunas wali sumawa ukat .
Like before, he was right.	Kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
The problem for me was obvious.	Nayatakejj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
There are two individuals.	Pä sapa mayniw utji.

He lives sincerely and so sincerely.	Jupajj taqe chuyma ukat ukham taqe chuymaw jakasi.
But now he wondered.	Ukampis jichhajj akham sasaw jisktʼasïna.
But no one knew where it came from.	Ukampis kawkitsa jutäna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
I really don’t want this.	Chiqpachansa janiw akax munkti.
Each of these	Sapa mayniw .
What do you think?.	¿Kuns jumax amuyta?.
Ugly and unnecessary.	Jan wali ukat jan wakiskir.
The last book.	Qhipa libro.
But first things first.	Ukampis nayrïr kunaw nayraqat utjäna.
It’s a very important time.	Mä pachanx wali wakiskiriwa.
A little bit of water.	Mä juk’a uma.
I don’t mean anyone.	Janiw khitis sañ munkti.
There isn’t one.	Janiw maynix utjkiti.
Let’s take a look at the area.	Uka chiqa uñjañäni.
And they always know better.	Ukat sapa kutiw jukʼamp sum yatipxi.
He’s known for that.	Jupax uka tuqit uñt’atawa.
Why not .	Kunatsa jan .
Of course, he has to do it.	Chiqansa, jupaw ukham lurañapa.
Now it felt different.	Jichhajj yaqha ukhamwa jikjjatasïna.
Very big and all that.	Wali jach’a ukat taqi ukanak.
But that is not the question now.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkiti.
So much water.	Ukhama walja uma.
And it’s good here.	Ukat aka chiqanx wali askiwa.
Not a good opportunity.	Janiw mä suma oportunidad utjkiti.
I know that, she thought.	Nayajj uk yattwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
The truth is he rides.	Chiqaw jupax kayuk saraski.
And kind of not.	Ukat mä kasta jan.
I started eating my first one already.	Nayax nayrïr manq’añ qalltawayta niyaw.
This means that it still exists.	Ukax wali ch’amampiw utji sañ muni.
It was a cold, windy morning.	Ukajj wali thaya, thaya alwaw utjäna.
He knew nothing about himself.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jupa pachpat yatkänti.
He had a big nothing.	Jupax mä jach’a janiw kunas utjkänti.
I just want to say this.	Nayax ukhamakiw akham sañ munta.
He doesn’t care if he doesn’t.	Jupax janiw kuns lurañ munkiti, janiw uk lurkiti.
But I know what it is.	Ukampis kunas uk sum yatta.
He watched it for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow uk uñchʼukiskäna.
But almost immediately things take a turn for the worse.	Ukampis niya jankʼakiw kunanakas jan walin uñjasi.
I decided to be more honest.	Nayax juk’amp chiqapar sarnaqañ amtawayta.
I already know everything.	Nayax niyaw taqi kun yatta.
You are in trouble .	Jumax jan walt'äwin jikxatastaxa .
This is definitely a better aircraft.	Akax chiqpachans mä juk’amp suma avión ukhamawa.
I'm better than everything else.	Nayax taqi kunat sipan juk'amp askiwa.
He didn’t feel very loyal.	Jupax janiw sinti chiqa chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
He promised to do better in the future.	Jutïrin jukʼamp sum lurañwa arsüna.
That first night alone.	Uka nayrïr arumax sapakiw.
And he doesn’t love her.	Ukat janiw jupar munaskiti.
It’s quick and delicious.	Ukax jank’akiw ukat wali sumawa.

I did all this myself.	Taqe ukanak naya pachpaw lurawayta.
Definitely not breakfast.	Chiqpachansa janiwa desayuno ukaxa utjkiti.
This is often seen.	Ukajj walja kutiw uñjasi.
I can't imagine why anyone would do that.	Kunatsa maynix ukham luraspa ukxa janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
Mary was small and petite.	Mariajj jiskʼa ukat jiskʼa jaqënwa.
Here at this place .	Aka chiqanx aka chiqanx .
I am always so grateful.	Sapa kutiw ukham yuspärta.

Maybe you can do that?	Inas jumax ukham lurasma?
But tonight’s about it .	Ukampis jichha arumax uka tuqitxa .
He tried not to do that.	Jupajj jan ukham lurañatakiw chʼamachasïna.
But I take good care of them.	Ukampis nayaw jupanakar sum uñjta.
But you’re on your own.	Ukampis jumax sapakiw jikxatastaxa.
That alone speaks for itself.	Uka sapakiw jupa pachpa arsu.
I can't quite figure out how.	Kunjamsa uk janiw sum amuytʼirjamäkti.
So many, you know.	Ukham walja, jumax yatisktawa.
And that’s just .	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw .
I still don't know why.	Kunatsa uk jichhakamajj janiw yatkti.
Of course that’s what it looks like.	Chiqansa ukax ukham uñt’atawa.
So do whatever you can.	Ukhamajj kunatï lurañjamäki uk lurañamawa.
What is it about .	Kunas uka tuqitxa .
Every single thing is worth it.	Sapa mayniw ukax wali askiwa.
That’s why it’s unbearable.	Ukatwa jan aguantañjamäkiti.
It’s also very nice as well.	Ukhamaraki wali suma ukhama.
There would be no problem with this.	Ukham lurasajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
He barely stayed here.	Jupajj jukʼakiw aka cheqan qheparäna.
And yes this is very difficult.	Ukat jïsa akax wali ch’amawa.
More than that, it is.	Ukat sipansa, jukʼampiw uka.
And more needs to be done.	Ukat jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
They had nothing to do with success.	Jupanakajj janiw sum sarnaqañ toqet kunatï utjkänti.
There was none this morning.	Jichha alwax janiw khitis utjkänti.
In the first case, .	Nayrïr tuqitxa, .
And no one knows what happened.	Ukat kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But again he did nothing.	Ukampis mayampsa janiw kuns lurkänti.
There is no time.	Janiw tiempox utjkiti.
No, he could have done what he had to do.	Janiwa, kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luraspänwa.
They just might.	Jupanakax ukhamakiw inas.
This made everyone a little upset.	Ukax taqiniruw mä juk’a chuym ch’allxtayäna.
I'm now that.	Nayax jichhax uka.
I understand all of this.	Taqe ukanak sum amuyta.
No one quite understood it.	Janiw khitis uk sum amuykänti.
But two nights, too.	Ukampis pä arumaw, ukhamaraki.
My, he didn't like that.	Nayan, jupajj janiw ukham gustkänti.
Or with anyone for that matter.	Jan ukax khitimpis uka tuqitxa.
I didn’t want to tell you.	Janiw yatiyañ munkayätti.
It was pretty good though.	Ukax wali sumapunïnwa ukampis.
I just want to see it.	Nayax ukhamakiw uñjañ munta.
There is no house.	Janiw utax utjkiti.
He’s very popular at this point.	Jupax aka pachanx wali uñt’atawa.
The what and where.	Uka kunas ukat kawkhansa.
Something bad happens to him.	Kunas jan waliw jupar pasaspa.
He did it only once.	Mä kutikiw uk luräna.
He knew she was curious.	Jupajj wal yatiñ muni uk sum yatïna.
So why would you do that?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunatsa jumajj ukham lurasma?.
We’ll make dinner.	Jiwasax manq’añanak lurañäni.
This is really cool.	Akax chiqpachapuniw wali suma.
That’s good, because this is hard to do.	Ukax wali askiwa, kunatix akax lurañax ch’amawa.
The question was unnecessary.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw wakiskänti.
But other than that .	Ukampis ukat sipansa yaqha .
Bad bad, not good bad.	Jan wali jan wali, janiw suma jan wali.
There is no need to do this.	Uk lurañajj janiw wakiskiti.
He decided to go home alone in great distress.	Ukat wali llakitaw sapaki utar sarañ amtäna.
I decided not to do anything.	Jan kun lurañwa amtawayta.
No, all of these are fine.	Janiwa, taqe ukanakajj walikïskiwa.
A bad kind of that.	Mä jan wali kasta uka.
It’s something inside you.	Ukax mä kunaw jumanakan manqhan utji.
Or the other way around.	Jan ukajj yaqha toqetwa.
He could have done it differently.	Jupajj yaqha toqetwa ukanak luraspäna.
I’m still feeling it.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw jikxatastxa.
The guy just did it.	Uka chachax ukhamakiw luratayna.
They don’t know how to talk like that.	Jupanakax janiw ukham parlañ yatipkiti.
But that is a long way off.	Ukampis ukajj wali jaya tiempow pasaski.
He also says no when she says yes.	Jupax ukhamarakiw jïsa sañ munki ukhax janiw sasaw saraki.
I think he did it immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uk luräna sasaw amuyta.
I’ve done the same thing.	Nayax ukhamarakiw lurawayta.
I’m so excited and I’m so happy.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa ukat wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
And still more than a little fun.	Ukat wali juk’ampi mä juk’a kusiskañawa.
You are a different kind of person.	Jumax yaqha kasta jaqiwa.
One cannot have it both ways.	Maynix janiw pä tuqit ukax utjkaspati.
He didn't quite understand what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw sum amuykänti.
I don’t really want to go.	Nayax janiw chiqpachans sarañ munkti.
That’s okay, it really is.	Ukax walikïskiwa, chiqpachansa ukhamawa.
No, so much better.	Janiwa, ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa.
I know that by doing so.	Ukham lurasajj uk sum yatta.
He means nothing to me now.	Jupajj jichhajj nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
Which he couldn't do.	Ukajj janiw lurañ puedkänti.
Let’s see now .	Jichhax uñjañäni .
That made everything better.	Ukaw taqi kuns sum luräna.
He declined to comment at the time.	Jupajj janiw uka tiempon kuns sañ munkänti.
This will take about half an hour.	Ukajj niya chika horaw pasani.
He is a stupid man.	Jupajj mä loqhe jaqewa.
I am glad to see the house safe.	Utar jan kuna jan waltʼäwin uñjasajj wal kusista.
For one thing, he was excited.	Mä tuqitxa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
But I ask myself.	Ukampis sasaw jisktʼasta.
That was the people.	Ukaw jaqenakajj utjäna.
So it's very quiet.	Ukhamajj wali amukiw jikjjatasi.
But then one day something happened.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, mä uruw kunas pasäna.
Three days, he said.	Kimsa uruw sasaw säna.
He took a good look at it.	Jupajj wali sumwa uk uñjäna.
Like he did, before.	Kunjamtï jupax lurkäna ukhama, nayrax.
So can anyone else.	Ukhamarakiw maynix luraspa.
He doesn't need to do that.	Jupajj janiw uk lurañajj wakiskiti.
He’s safe with us.	Jupax jiwasamp chikaw jan kuna jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
That’s what happened next.	Ukaw qhepat pasäna.
I still don't know where he is.	Wali sumwa kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk jan yatkti.
I really don’t want to tell you his name.	Chiqpachansa janiw sutip yatiyañ munkti.
He talked about her a lot.	Jupajj walpun jupat parläna.
Instead, he did something.	Jan ukasti, kuns luräna.
Whatever you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta ukjja.
If you do a good job.	Jumatix mä suma irnaqäw lurasma ukhaxa.
You know, someone who has a .	Jumax yatisktawa, maynix mä .

It’s a big one, really.	Mä jach’a jaqiwa, chiqpachansa.
I still hope this is wrong.	Nayax wali suyt’twa akax janiw walïkiti.
I know it’s not what you expected.	Nayax yattwa, janiw kunjamtï jumax suykayäta ukhamäkiti.
But he didn't realize it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw amuyaskänti.
It’s also very very hot.	Ukhamaraki wali wali junt’u.
No one knew what he was going to do next.	Janiw khitis kuns jutïrin lurañap yatkänti.
A few more days.	Mä qawqha urunak juk’ampi.

But it hasn’t happened yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax ukhamäkiti.

He told her to do it several times.	Walja kutiw uk luram sasaw säna.
And now it doesn’t work.	Ukat jichhax janiw irnaqkiti.
I told him no, snow.	Nayax juparux janiw sañ munkti, ch’uqi.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit juk’amp parlañ munkti.
I’ve loved him for a very long time.	Nayax juparux walpun munasta, wali jaya tiempo.
But not much can be done about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet wal lurañjamäkiti.
He says what he wants.	Kuntï munki uk arsu.
I never went to a class.	Janipuniw mä clasen sarkti.
I think they’re good there.	Nayax amuyta, jupanakax ukanx wali askiwa.
It is never necessary.	Janipuniw ukajj wakiskiti.
Yes, it has been that long.	Jïsa, ukham jaya tiempow utji.

It really just felt that way.	Chiqpachansa ukhamakiw jikxatasïna.
It’s so much fun!.	¡Ukhamajj wali kusiskañawa!.
Pretty new indeed.	Suma machaq chiqpachansa.
And now he wants to go at it again.	Ukat jichhax wasitat ukaruw sarañ muni.
It seemed to mean something.	Ukajj kuns sañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
Always was, always will be.	Sapa kutiw utjäna, sapa kutiw utjani.
I actually really did that.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachapuniw ukham lurawayta.
He’s right there.	Jupax chiqaw uka chiqan jikxatasi.
So no one is at home.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis utan utjkiti.
A really long one.	Chiqpachansa mä jaya tiempo.
Also, they are .	Ukhamaraki, jupanakax .
We all have them.	Taqinipuniw ukanak utjistu.
He will do it later.	Jupajj qhepatwa uk lurani.
That is almost nothing.	Ukajj niyaw jan kunäkisa.
I almost did it.	Nayajj niyaw uk lurayäta.
He saw the possibilities.	Jupax kunanaktï lurañjamäki ukanak uñjäna.
He was sleeping a little bit.	Jupajj mä jukʼa ikiskäna.
The school takes care of it all.	Yatiqañ utax taqi ukanak uñji.
So either there or something or not.	Ukhamajj uka cheqan jan ukajj kuna jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
I think maybe you probably do.	Nayax inas jumax inas ukham amuyta.
Do it well, but not too much.	Uk sum lurañamawa, ukampis janiw sinti lurañamäkiti.
I was doing the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw luraskäna.
That was the best thing that could happen.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, ukaw pasaspa.
We’ll see how it goes this time.	Kunjamsa aka kutix saraski uk uñjañäni.
I hope he’s right.	Nayax jupax chiqaw sasaw suyt’ta.
Nothing else was needed.	Janiw yaqha kunas wakiskänti.
There’s a new one every day.	Sapa uruw mä machaq utji.
We’ll see at that time.	Uka pachan uñjañäni.
Of course, it was okay.	Chiqansa, walikïskiwa.
I never got any of it.	Janipuniw ukanak jikxatkti.
There was never a us.	Janipuniw mä jiwasax utjkänti.
He had just realized that.	Jupajj jichhakiw ukham amuyasïna.
Try to make the most of it.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw chʼamachasiñama.
He finally comes home with me.	Jupax qhipharux nayamp chikaw utar puri.
I think he’s a good guy.	Nayatakix jupax wali suma jaqiwa.
I said it wasn’t too bad.	Nayax janiw sinti jan walïkiti sasaw sista.
These were two separate incidents.	Ukanakajj pä sapa mayniw pasäna.
It looks pretty simple to me.	Nayatakix wali ch’amaw uñtasi.
But, it doesn't matter.	Ukampis, janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
Big and ugly.	Jach’a ukat jan wali.
Every day was a school day.	Sapa uruw yatiqañ urux utjäna.
I didn't understand them at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw jupanakar amuykayätti.
When he did something.	Kunapachatï jupax kuns lurkäna ukhaxa.
Now he lives in secret.	Jichhajj jamasat jakasi.
He is a bad guy .	Jupajj jan wali jaqewa .
When we arrived, there was no one there.	Uka cheqar purisajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
This time he was alone.	Jichha kutix sapakiw jikxatasïna.
He said something that wasn't true.	Jupajj kunatï jan cheqäki uk sänwa.
And things tend to move a little better.	Ukat kunanakas mä jukʼa sum sarnaqañ yati.
He went with them.	Jupajj jupanakar chikaw saräna.
I am doing myself.	Nayajj nayat luraskta.
I tried my best to support it.	Ukar yanaptʼañatakejj taqe chʼamampiw chʼamachasiyäta.
It’s all about that.	Taqeniw ukajja.
I could do this day many times.	Aka urux walja kutiw luraspäna.
The coffee is easy to make.	Uka café lurañax wali ch’amawa.
He told her that.	Jupajj ukhamwa jupar säna.
He started all over again.	Jupax taqi kuns wasitat qalltäna.
There is no problem for me.	Nayatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
It’s very clear to me now.	Jichhax nayatakix wali qhanawa.
This is fine if you want to drink alone.	Ukax wali askiwa, jumatix sapak umañ munsta ukhaxa.
It arrived before everything else.	Taqi kunat nayraw purinïna.
I really have no problem with that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqitxa kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
The first meal is very difficult.	Nayrïr manq’añax wali ch’amawa.
It will be very rare.	Ukax wali juk’akiw utjani.
I made the dinner.	Nayax manq’añanak lurayäta.
But of course, it wasn’t, not really.	Ukampis chiqansa, janiw ukhamäkänti, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkänti.
The day went by so fast.	Uka urux wali jank’akiw sarxäna.
They don't know what to do.	Jupanakajj janiw kun lurañsa yatipkiti.
I love doing it.	Nayax lurañax walpun munta.
He did everything quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw taqe kun luräna.
There was nothing like it in the past.	Nayra tiemponjja, janipuniw ukham kunas utjkänti.
But, there was nothing I could do.	Ukampis, janiw kunas lurañax utjkänti.
He’s definitely got to do it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw lurañapa.
But it is a .	Ukampis ukajj mä .

That’s how I like it about that.	Ukhamaw uka tuqitxa nayatakix wali askïspa.
Of course, nothing did.	Chiqansa, janiw kunas ukham lurkänti.
He was very happy here.	Jupax akanx wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He cared for her, and she knew it.	Jupajj jupar sum uñjäna, jupajj uk sum yatïna.
But he told me he wanted it all.	Ukampis taqe ukanak munta sasaw sitäna.
Actually, no, it's better than that.	Chiqansa, janiwa, ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
This was only the first time.	Ukajj nayrïr kutikiw utjäna.
So what are we going to do?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunsa lurañäni?.
I wonder if he likes me.	Jupajj nayar gustkituti sasaw jisktʼasta.
It's still a popular one.	Ukax wali uñt'atawa.
He didn't want to do it himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpa uk lurañ munkänti.
He could have done that back then.	Uka tiemponjja, ukham luraspänwa.
What, he said .	Kunas, sasaw säna .
They’re all that important about it.	Jupanakax taqpach uka tuqitx wali wakiskiriwa.
And he means it right there.	Ukat jupax ukanx chiqpachapuniw sañ muni.
I don’t want to talk.	Janiw nayax parlañ munkti.
I’m already doing this.	Nayax nayraqat uk luraskta.
I have been here for many years.	Walja maranakaw akanktxa.
I'm coming to you.	Nayajj jumanakan ukar jutta.
Anything better than that.	Kunas ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Something felt horribly wrong.	Kunas wali axsarkañ jan waliw jikxatasïna.
I did something a little bit harder.	Nayax mä juk’a ch’amampiw kuns lurayäta.
He could have done what he said.	Jupajj kuntï siskäna uk luraspänwa.
Or very good.	Jan ukax wali suma.
He had seen it many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uñjäna.
But we have to do both.	Ukampis panpachaniw lurañasa.
I haven’t found it yet.	Nayax janiw jichhakamax jikxatkti.
He told me he knew how to handle it.	Jupax kunjams apnaqañ yati sasaw sitäna.
But you .	Ukampis jumax .
That is all very rare.	Ukajj taqe kunas wali jukʼakiw utji.
He is not worthy.	Jupajj janiw askïkiti.
He witnessed everything that happened firsthand.	Jupajj taqe kunatï paskäna uk jupa pachpaw uñjäna.
He doesn't know exactly what he just said.	Kuntï jichhak siskäna uk janiw sum yatkiti.
That is not necessary today.	Jichhürunakanxa janiw ukax wakiskiti.
He didn’t believe it, alone.	Jupax janiw iyaw siskänti, sapakiw.
Now he was looking excited.	Jichhajj wali kusisitaw uñchʼukiskäna.
I’m starting to see what he’s doing.	Nayax kuntix jupax luraski uk uñjañ qalltawayta.
Now there could be anything.	Jichhax kunas utjaspa.
No one understands.	Janiw khitis amuykiti.
I understand how I feel about them.	Jupanakar kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk amuyasta.
Too too fast is not good for you.	Sinti sinti jankʼak lurañax janiw jumatakix askïkiti.

There was money to be made.	Ukanjja qollqe lurañaw utjäna.
I did the latter.	Nayax qhip qhipa lurawayta.
But he’s not really like that.	Ukampis jupax janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
Never could, of course.	Janipuniw ukham lurañ puedkänti, chiqpachansa.
But it’s not right, it’s not.	Ukampis janiw walïkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Very little is needed now.	Jichhax wali juk’akiw wakisi.
None of this is good enough.	Janiw kunas ukax askïkiti.
How he did it, he wasn't sure.	Kunjamsa uk luräna, uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Don’t get any more slow.	Janiw juk’ampi juk’ampi.
That is not a good thing for us.	Ukajj janiw jiwasatak askïkiti.

He didn’t understand anything.	Jupax janiw kuns amuyaskänti.
Everyone knows this of course.	Taqinipuniw uk yatipxi chiqpachansa.
But all of that is fine .	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj walikïskiwa .
Not necessary here, he doesn’t.	Janiw akan wakiskiti, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
And he knew what was going to happen.	Ukat kunas pasani uk amuyasïna.
Of course he loved her.	Chiqansa jupax juparux walpun munasïna.

This is a big surprise.	Akax mä jach’a muspharkañawa.
You need very little.	Jumax wali juk’akiw munasispa.
Instead, it’s a lot of fun.	Jan ukasti, wali kusiskañawa.
He’ll do it again.	Jupax wasitat lurani.
And he left them.	Ukat jupajj jupanakar jaytawayi.
I saw what he was saying.	Nayajj kuntï siskäna uk uñjta.
What could be the problem.	Kunas uka jan waltʼäwejj utjaspa.
He knew what was going on.	Kunas pasaski uk sum yatïna.
He couldn't take his eyes off hers.	Jupajj janiw nayranakap jupan nayranakap apsuñ puedkänti.
And, somehow, he knows about you.	Ukat, kunjamatsa, jupax jumat yati.
Nobody likes everything.	Janiw khitis taqi kuns gustkiti.
Let’s see what happened last time.	Qhipa kutix kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
He looks very familiar.	Jupax wali uñt’at uñnaqaniwa.
There was never a reason before.	Nayrajj janipuniw kuna razonas utjkänti.
Yes, it happened last year.	Jïsa, pasïr maraw ukham pasäna.
There would be time, plenty of time, eventually.	Tiempow utjaspa, walja tiempow utjaspa, qhepatjja.
That did the work.	Ukaw uka lurañanak luräna.
Whoever you love.	Khitirus jumajj munasta.
That’s where everything happened.	Ukan taqe kunas pasäna.
I only see him about once a week or so.	Semanan niya mä kuti jan ukajj mä kutikiw jupar uñjta.
Of course, I said no.	Chiqansa, janiw sasaw sista.
And I am grateful that I can’t help it.	Ukat janiw kuns lurirjamäkti, ukatwa yuspärta.
Here's that and, that.	Akax uka ukat, uka.
Last year was a disappointment.	Nayra marax wali llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He paid for it.	Jupaw uka lurañatak qollqe churäna.
Of course that doesn’t mean much right now.	Chiqansa ukax janiw jichhax sinti sañ munkiti.
He went everywhere, where better.	Taqi kawkirus saräna, kawkhans juk’amp askïspa.
That’s all there really is now.	Ukakiw chiqpachapuni jichhax utji.
Now he rolled his eyes.	Jichhax jupax nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
Money is tight, time is tight.	Qullqix wali ch’amawa, pachax wali ch’amawa.
Beyond that, it worked fine.	Ukat sipansa, wali sumaw irnaqäna.
Now every eye was on him.	Jichhajj sapa nayraw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Find yourself tomorrow.	Qhipürux juma pachpaw jikxatasïta.
This money is well worth it.	Aka qullqix wali askiwa.
One is not good enough.	Maynix janiw askïkiti.
I don’t need to do that again.	Janiw nayax wasitat ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
That’s all you have to do, really.	Ukakiw lurañama, chiqpachansa.
He was the first to arrive.	Jupaw nayraqat purinïna.
Everything fascinated him.	Taqi kunas juparux chuym ch’allxtayäna.
I didn’t want it too much.	Janiw sinti munkayätti.
A terrific book.	Mä wali muspharkañ libro.
That spoke volumes.	Ukajj walpun arsüna.
I came here to study.	Nayax akham yatxatañ utar jutta.
Long, but surprisingly surprising.	Jaya, ukampis muspharkañ muspharkañawa.
So he didn't know what it was.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas uk yatkänti.
Actually that is what it does.	Chiqansa ukax kuntï luraski ukawa.
I’m hoping so, actually.	Nayax ukham suyt’askta, chiqpachansa.
I’m sure he’s still feeling it.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasi.
He just wanted more of what he wanted.	Jupajj ukhamakiw kunanaktï munkäna ukanak jukʼamp munäna.
He didn't know everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kun yatkänti.
There may be time for that later.	Ukatakejj qhepat tiempow utjaspa.
It spent a lot of time alone.	Ukajj walja tiempo sapakiw sarnaqäna.
He saw blood, lots of blood.	Jupax wila uñjäna, walja wila.
That we have a sat.	Ukax jiwasax mä sat.
Much more, actually.	Walja juk’ampi, chiqpachansa.
One thing he decided.	Mä kunaw jupajj amtäna.
You know what’s going on here.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas akanx utji.
I’m doing it myself.	Naya pachpaw luraskta.
They are clearly not this time.	Jupanakax qhanaw aka kutix janiw ukhamäkiti.
I was really surprised with myself.	Chiqpachansa naya pachpaw wal muspharta.
His definitely did.	Jupan chiqpachapuniw ukham luratayna.
Everything is very very simple.	Taqi kunas wali wali ch’amawa.
In fact, it will be the first time.	Chiqansa, nayrïr kutiw ukham lurañäni.
I’m pretty clear about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali qhanaw amuyta.
He knew exactly what she was feeling.	Jupajj kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
He didn't say it, he promised it.	Jupajj janiw uk siskänti, jan ukasti arsüna.
He loved to live.	Jupajj jakañ wal munäna.
I think he’s very rich.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali qamir jaqiwa.
You are not like that .	Jumax janiw ukhamäkiti .
No, that was not the case .	Janiwa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
I really want a house.	Chiqpachansa mä utax walpun munta.
Nothing really wrong with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas chiqpachapuni jan walïkiti.
Or immediately.	Jan ukax jank’akiw.
I really want to leave.	Nayax sarxañ walpun munta.
Later, as he did with her.	Qhepatjja, kunjamtï jupamp lurkäna ukhama.
He decides to stop working in a meeting.	Jupax mä tantachäwin irnaqañ jaytañ amti.
But he wanted to know.	Ukampis yatiñ munäna.
He went home today.	Jupajj jichhüruw utar sarjjäna.
He must be the first to do so.	Jupaw nayraqat ukanak lurañapa.
She really seems to be in good shape right now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamawa.
He was in love with her.	Jupajj jupampiw munasïna.
But there is such a thing as too much.	Ukampis sinti jachʼa ukham mä kunaw utji.
He ended up doing jail time, jail time.	Jupax carcelan tiempo, carcelan tiempo lurañ tukuyäna.
So he spoke up about it.	Ukatwa jupajj uka toqet arsüna.
Things can really work out for you.	Chiqpachansa, kunanakas jumatakix askïspawa.
I intend to be successful.	Nayax sum sarnaqañ amtasta.
He only knew one thing.	Jupajj mä sapak yatïna.
But it’s amazing that he’s doing that.	Ukampis jupax ukham luraski ukax wali muspharkañawa.
So what did he expect.	Ukhamajj kunsa jupajj suyäna.
Never good, really.	Janipuniw kunas askïkiti, chiqpachansa.
Do what you can in this moment.	Aka pachanx kuntï lurañjamäki uk luram.
He didn’t say his real name for so long.	Jupax janiw chiqpach sutip ukham jaya tiempox arskänti.
I always take good care of them.	Sapa kutiw jupanakar sum uñjta.
It lasts about half an hour.	Ukax niya chika horaw utji.
So stupid of me.	Ukhama loqhe nayat.
He doesn’t do much.	Jupax janiw walpun lurkiti.
That’s what called him.	Ukaw jupar jawsäna.
He will do what is necessary.	Jupaw kunatï wakiski uk lurani.
He pretty much knew everything.	Jupajj niyaw taqe kun yatïna.
Longer and slower.	Juk’ampi jaya ukat llamp’u.
After that, there was more light, and sooner.	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼamp qhanaw utjäna, ukat jankʼakiw utjäna.
It was the best of him.	Ukajj jupat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa.
I want everything to pass.	Nayax taqi kunas pasañap munta.
I don't need to do that.	Nayajj janiw ukanak lurañatakejj wakiskiti.
I understood why he recommended it.	Kunatsa uka cheq ewjjtʼäna uk sum amuyayäta.
You may think so, but it’s not.	Inas jumax ukham amuyasta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
He spoke all the time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw parläna.
Fortunately, however, this is not the case today.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj wali askiwa.
The man said he could actually do it.	Uka jaqix chiqpachansa luraspawa sasaw säna.
So now everything is fine.	Ukhamajj jichhajj taqe kunas walikïskiwa.
He told me these things.	Jupaw ukanak nayarojj sitäna.
He just does things like that.	Jupax ukhamakiw kuns luraski.
He gave them my location.	Jupaw kawkhansa jikjjatasta uk jupanakar churäna.
I’m doing that right now.	Nayax jichhax ukham luraskta.
Instead, you should strive to improve.	Jan ukasti jukʼamp sum lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
But now he does nothing.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw kuns lurkiti.
I think that’s important.	Nayax amuyta, ukax wali wakiskiriwa.
It can do more or less.	Ukajj jukʼampiw jan ukajj jankʼak luraspa.
He wondered what it was.	¿Kunas ukajj sasaw jisktʼasïna.
You have a year to do these things.	Ukanak lurañatakix mä maraw utji.
I did nothing more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns lurkti.
He sees it well.	Jupajj sumwa uñji.
I’m so, so glad you felt that way.	Nayax wali, wali kusisitaw jumax ukham jikxatasiyäta.
But it already looks like that.	Ukampis niyaw ukham uñtasi.
He threw it at me.	Jupajj ukanak nayaruw jaqontäna.
Sorry, he said.	Perdón, sasaw säna.
This guy is a piece of meat.	Aka waynax aycha ch’uqi satawa.
There is no such thing now.	Jichhax janiw ukax utjkiti.
That’s the reason why it exists.	Ukax kunatsa ukax utji.
In fact, it’s amazing.	Chiqansa, muspharkañawa.
Better than you, better than me.	Jumat sipan juk'amp suma, nayat sipan juk'amp suma.
He did that for me.	Jupax nayatakix ukham luratayna.
You are new to this.	Jumax aka tuqit machaq jaqiwa.
He pressed it carefully.	Wali amuyumpiw ukaruw ch’allt’äna.
He walked nearby.	Jupax uka jak’an sarnaqäna.
Much, much needs to be done around here.	Walja, walja lurañaw wakisi aka jak’an.
I don’t need that.	Nayax janiw ukax wakiskiti.
I left them with you.	Nayaw jupanakar jumamp jaytawayta.
So he was watching her.	Ukatwa jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.
But he couldn’t stay there very late at night.	Ukampis janiw sinti arumax ukan qhiparañ puedkänti.
In fact, I intend to do so.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañ amtasta.
I want to be my own person one day.	Nayax mä urux naya pachpa jaqir tukuñ munta.
I don’t see anyone cold.	Janiw khitirus thaya uñjkti.
But okay, everything is fine now.	Ukampis walikïskiwa, jichhajj taqe kunas walikïskiwa.
It’s always been there.	Nayratpachaw utjäna.
You can do the same thing.	Jumajj ukhamarakiw uk lurasma.
It really means that.	Chiqpachansa ukax sañ muni.
There’s something more there.	Ukanx kunas juk’ampi utji.
In fact, he’s very happy.	Chiqansa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
It’s been a lot of fun for me.	Nayatakix wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
This year it was okay.	Aka marax walikïskiwa.
Tomorrow could be a long day.	Qhipürux mä jach’a uruw utjaspa.
But that does everything.	Ukampis ukajj taqe kunwa luraski.
He knows exactly who that man is.	Uka jaqejj khitïnsa uk sum yati.
There, they .	Ukanjja, jupanakajj .
This is all so very foreign.	Akax taqpach ukhama wali yaqha markankir jaqiwa.
There is nothing there is nothing.	Janiw kunas utjkiti janiw kunas utjkiti.
There are many things like this.	Walja kunanakas ukham utji.
It almost never works.	Niya janipuniw irnaqkiti.
He didn't like her very much.	Jupajj janiw jupar sinti gustkänti.
There were no such people at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukham jaqenakajj utjkänti.
He looked earnest.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw uñnaqäna.
Three times a week.	Mä semanan kimsa kuti.
And he called them.	Ukat jupanakar jawsäna.
But let’s see what I’m doing.	Ukampis kuntï luraskta uk uñjañäni.
You just came from the big city.	Jumax jichhakiw jach’a markar markat jutta.
There’s nothing you can do here.	Janiw kunas jumatakix akan lurañax utjkiti.
So it’s just you and me.	Ukhamajj jumampi nayampejj ukhamakiw.
But yeah, it really was.	Ukampis jïsa, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
A piece of snowflakes.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
That’s a lot of energy.	Ukax mä jach’a ch’amawa.
I will go with him.	Nayajj jupamp chikaw sarä.
I denied that.	Nayax ukax janiw sasaw arsuwayta.
But he knew that was not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I loved seeing that.	Uk uñjasajj walpun munasta.
In fact, he did it himself.	Chiqansa, jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
I think you know where that is.	Nayax amuyta, jumax yatisktawa kawkhans ukax utji.
But it's still fun at least.	Ukampis wali kusiskañawa mä jukʼa.
I prefer to do things myself.	Naya pachpaw kuns lurañajj jukʼamp askejja.
It’s too young for me.	Nayatakix wali waynawa.
He gave it, very happy.	Jupax churäna, wali kusisitaw.
He worked there for nearly three decades.	Ukat niya kimsa tunka maranakaw ukan irnaqäna.
No one liked it.	Janiw khitis gustkänti.
Do it, and you will feel better.	Ukham luram, ukat jukʼamp sumwa jikxatasïta.
You are happy aren’t you?.	Jumax kusisitaw jikxatastaxa ¿janich ukhamäki?.
He really guards the gate.	Chiqpachansa jupaw punku uñji.
And you’re important.	Ukat jumax wali wakiskiriwa.
And many times after that.	Ukat walja kutiw uka qhepatjja.
But, he doesn’t understand anything.	Ukampis, jupax janiw kuns amuykiti.
This, or that.	Aka, jan ukax uka.
I am very grateful to him.	Jupat wal yuspärta.
Who else, who better.	Khitis yaqha, khitis juk’amp suma.
And it wasn't now.	Ukat janiw jichhajj utjkänti.
I think that’s absolutely wrong.	Nayax amuyta, ukax chiqpachapuniw jan walïkiti.
I don’t know anything about that.	Ukanakat janiw kunsa yatkti.
But he could do no more now.	Ukampis janiw jichhajj jukʼamp lurañ puedkänti.
Now it is the same	Jichhajj ukhamarakiw .
I was terrified of doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wal ajjsarayäta.
He knew what was going on.	Jupajj kunas pasaski uk sum yatïna.
I know this well also.	Nayax uk sum yatta ukhamaraki.
Thank you very much!.	¡Wali walpun yuspärta!.
There’s really no other way to do it.	Chiqpachansa janiw yaqha lurañax utjkiti.
Kind of, maybe.	Mä kasta, inas.
How he behaved, too.	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna, ukhamaraki.
I had no idea what the question could be.	Kunas uka jisktʼajj utjaspa uk janiw amuykayätti.
You need to do something.	Mä juk’a lurañaw wakisi.
Didn't expect to see it here.	Janiw akan uñjañ suykayätti.
A terrible future he didn’t want.	Mä axsarkañ jutïr pachax janiw munkänti.
He said no, never.	Jupajj janiw sasaw säna, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
He turned around immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kuttʼjjäna.
The next thing was worse.	Uka qhepatjja jukʼamp jan waliw utjäna.
Always a little .	Sapa kutiw mä jukʼa .
And very quickly .	Ukat wali jankʼakiw .
Always have and probably always will.	Sapa kutiw ukham lurawayta ukat inas ukhamarakiw utjani.
I know this is hard for you.	Nayax yattwa akax jumatakix wali ch’amawa.
Please share your love!.	¡Jan wali munasiñampiw yatiyañama!.
He politely refused to talk about his work.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw jan irnaqäwipat parlañ munkänti.
Still not good enough for me.	Wali janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
And he’s very important.	Ukat jupax wali wakiskiriwa.
You need to do that as soon as possible.	Jumax jankʼakiw ukham lurañama.
How you already feel.	Kunjamsa jumax nayratpach jikxatasïta.
He doesn't want to eat.	Jupajj janiw manqʼañ munkiti.
But one never knows.	Ukampis maynix janipuniw yatkiti.
That actually works for me.	Ukax chiqpachansa nayatakix walikïskiwa.
Not good but not bad.	Janiw askïkiti ukampis janiw jan walïkiti.
We’re known for that.	Jiwasax ukham uñt’atawa.
But there was a time that was not there.	Ukampis mä tiempow utjäna, uka tiempojj janiw utjkänti.
That was three hours ago.	Ukajj kimsa horanak nayraw pasäna.
I didn't care at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa kuns lurkti.
He never knows.	Jupajj janipuniw yatkiti.
We’ll do the work.	Jiwasax uka lurañanak lurañäni.
In fact, it is much better than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Small, for one thing.	Jisk’a, mä tuqitxa.
I don’t want to talk.	Janiw parlañ munkti.
What was happening now.	Kunatï jichhajj luraskäna ukajja.
What’s next .	Kunas jutïrin utjani .
He said it would take twenty years.	Ukatakejj pä tunka maranakaw pasani sasaw säna.
I mean that with all my heart.	Nayajj taqe chuymaw uk sañ munta.
I would love to see another job.	Nayax yaqha irnaqäw uñjañ walpun munta.
One last word.	Mä qhipa aru.
It takes all day to do this.	Uka lurañatakix taqi uruw munasispa.
That was the case a long time ago.	Ukhamaw walja tiempo nayrajj jikjjatasïna.
He had just arrived.	Jupajj jichhakiw purinïna.
A few days later, he phoned.	Mä qawqha urunak qhepatjja, telefonot jawsäna.
It didn't make sense to me.	Janiw nayarojj amuykayätti.
I mean eating food.	Nayax manq’añ manq’añ sañ munta.
That was exactly what it meant.	Ukajj cheqpachapun ukham sañ munäna.
At the time, no one knew when.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw khitis kunapachas uk yatkänti.
He didn't, he said.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti, sasaw säna.
No, he wouldn't do that.	Janiwa, janiw jupajj ukham lurkaspänti.
It needed to be done quickly.	Jankʼak lurañaw wakisïna.
We need to do the same thing here.	Jiwasajj ukhamarakiw aka cheqan lurañasa.
This is the most common.	Akax juk’amp uñt’atawa.
It's not the first time he's done this.	Janiw jupajj nayrïr kuti ukham lurkiti.
They don’t know what’s out there.	Jupanakax janiw kunas uka anqan utjki ukx yatipkiti.
No one said anything, nothing.	Janiw khitis kuns arskänti, janiw kuns arskänti.
But today, people are fine.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, jaqenakajj walikïskiwa.
I gave it to you.	Nayajj uk churta.
One night he needed it.	Mä arumaw jupajj wakisïna.
It’s called something else.	Ukax yaqha satawa.
It’s worth going there one day.	Mä urux ukar sarañax wali askiwa.
Everything was like that.	Taqe kunas ukhamänwa.
That is especially important here.	Ukajj aka cheqan jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
It took me a while to get here.	Aka chiqar puriñkamax mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.
Farther than that, actually.	Ukat sipansa juk’amp jaya, chiqpachansa.
We went there the day before the wedding.	Janïr casarasiñatak mä uruw ukar sarapjjta.
He saw his new home for the first time.	Jupax nayrïr kutiw machaq utap uñjäna.
He could do what no one else did.	Jupajj kuntï jan khitis lurkäna uk luraspänwa.
And he’s happy there.	Ukat jupax ukan kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He’s okay with this.	Jupax aka tuqitx walikïskiwa.
It’s kind of fun actually.	Mä juk’a kusiskañawa chiqpachansa.
That's what I'm saying.	Ukhamaw nayajj sista.
He wondered how long that would take.	Ukatakejj qhawqha tiempos pasani sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He knows everything.	Jupajj taqeniw yati.
They’re the most popular.	Jupanakax juk’amp uñt’atawa.
But he already knew that.	Ukampis jupajj uk nayratpach sum yatïna.
There is a lot of light.	Walja qhanaw utji.
Do what you do.	Kuntï lurkta uk luram.
Do this for me.	Nayatakix aka luram.
Or here it is.	Jan ukax akham.
Really looking forward to it again.	Chiqpachansa wasitatwa uka tuqit suytʼaskta.
It can’t happen again.	Janiw mayamp ukham lurañax utjkaspati.

I knew that would happen.	Ukham kunas pasani uk sum yatiyäta.
I mean I really understand.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw amuyasta sañ munta.
I feel a whole new energy at this point.	Aka pachanx mä machaq ch’amaw jikxatasi.
He knows how to do it when he needs it.	Jupajj kunapachatï wakiski ukhajj kunjamsa uka lurañajj wakisi uk sum yati.
Do it tomorrow.	Qhipürux uk luram.
Of course he said yes.	Chiqansa jupax jïsa sasaw säna.
Kind of bad, that.	Mä juk’a jan wali, ukax.
But I don’t think it will come to that.	Ukampis janiw ukaruw purini sasaw amuyta.
The weather has a face.	Pachax uñnaqaniwa.
He never wanted to be proud.	Jupajj janipuniw jachʼa jachʼa tukuñ munkänti.
I hope it does.	Ukhamwa sasaw suytʼta.
Well he did it.	Sumaw jupax luräna.
I told him that it had nothing to do with it.	Ukajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti sasaw sista.
How he said it.	Kunjamsa jupajj säna.
There is no time this year.	Jichha marax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
It was still early in the morning.	Wali alwat ukhamänwa.
It still doesn’t feel right.	Wali jan waliw jikxatasi.
It’s something you can do anywhere.	Ukax mä kunaw kawkhans lurasma.
Well maybe a little bit.	Suma inas mä juk’a.
He will be home later.	Jupajj qhepatwa utar purini.
Too bad he thought.	Sinti jan waliw sasaw amuyäna.
I am just as busy.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jan tiemponïkti.
I hope to see you all there.	Taqiniruw ukan uñjañ suyt’askta.
It is immediately apparent how.	Kunjamsa uk jankʼakiw amuyasi.
Do the impossible.	Uka jan lurañjamäki ukanak lurañamawa.
We should have done that a long time ago.	Walja tiempo nayraw ukham lurañasa.
Both are separate.	Panpachaniw sapa maynix utji.
That will be another year.	Ukax yaqha maraw utjani.
He used to be the first to speak.	Nayrajj jupaw nayraqat parläna.
Of course, there are.	Chiqansa, ukanakaw utji.
The weather is amazing.	Pachax wali muspharkañawa.
Which, happily, is available now.	Ukax, kusisitaw, jichhax utji.
He wants meat too.	Jupax aycha munaraki.
I’ve done all of this.	Nayaw taqe ukanak lurawayta.
I’m the only one I think.	Nayax ukakiw nayax amuyta.
This one needed some time.	Akax mä juk’a pachaw munasïna.
Why he wanted her.	Kunatsa jupar munäna.
He and .	Jupajj ukat .
He wanted it big.	Jupax jach’a munäna.
He already knew the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk niyaw yatïna.
I guess that’s okay though.	Nayax amuyta ukax walikïskiwa ukampis.
He looked like he could do it.	Jupajj lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa uñnaqäna.
Well, one would be interesting.	Ukhama, maynix wali askïspawa.
I’m not sure how to go about doing that.	Nayax janiw kunjams uka lurañatakix sarañax ukx yatkti.
John barely noticed.	Juanajj jukʼakiw amuyasïna.
I’m absolutely right.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham sista.
I don't have that question.	Nayajj janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkituti.

And the other one didn’t.	Ukat maynix janiw ukham lurkänti.
That’s pretty quick for me.	Ukax nayatakix wali jank’akiw.
Now let's see what he does.	Jichhajj kunsa luri uk uñjañäni.
But no, we and .	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, jiwasax ukat .
And then he was.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, jupajj ukhamänwa.
Two or three weeks .	Pä jan ukajj kimsa semanaw .

He needs more time.	Jupajj jukʼamp tiempow munasi.
I don’t want to see them.	Janiw jupanakar uñjañ munkti.
A few hours later, he reached a town.	Mä qawqha horanak qhepatjja, mä markaruw purinïna.
Very large snowflakes.	Wali jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
What do you think.	Kunas jumax amuyta.
I want to give him the same chance every year.	Nayax sapa maraw jupar pachpa ch’am churañ munta.
It will have everything you need.	Ukajj taqe kunatï jumatak wakiski ukanakaw utjani.
She looked happy to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
It was about saying no.	Ukajj janiw sañ munkäna uka toqetwa parläna.
It’s going to rain a lot.	Walja jallu purini.
I won’t really do it.	Nayax janiw chiqpachansa uk lurkäti.
But that's just how he talked about it all.	Ukampis ukhamakiw jupajj taqe toqet parläna.
I know he wants to tell you himself.	Jupa pachpaw jumar yatiyañ munta uk yattwa.
Those are definitely three.	Ukanakax chiqpachapuniw kimsa.
That’s all very nice.	Ukax taqpach wali sumawa.
But the other one isn’t.	Ukampis maynix janiw ukhamäkiti.
And that’s fine .	Ukat ukax wali askiwa .
These are the facts.	Ukanakax chiqaw sañ muni.
He went to his own house.	Jupajj jupan utaparuw saräna.
He could have done without it.	Jupajj jan ukajj kunsa luraspänwa.
And he didn’t want to go.	Ukat jupax janiw sarañ munkänti.
He chooses to live alone.	Jupax sapakiw jakañ amti.
I didn't have it.	Nayajj janiw utjkänti.
It feels good, actually.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
Or with him.	Jan ukajj jupamp chika.
Now, there’s a very simple one.	Jichhax, mä wali ch’amaw utji.
He appreciated it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak wali askit uñjäna.
You're a stranger.	Jumax mä jan uñt'at jaqiwa.
It doesn’t mean anything goes.	Janiw kunas sarkiti sañ munkiti.
He decided to give it a chance.	Jupax mä ch’am churañ amtäna.
See how he feels tomorrow.	Qharürojj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk uñjañäni.
That ended up being pretty much the same.	Ukajj niya ukhamarakiw tukuyäna.
Never mind, he thought.	Janipuniw kunäkisa, sasaw amuyäna.
I'm better off, too.	Nayajj jukʼamp askiwa, ukhamaraki.
Maybe something a little .	Inas kunas mä jukʼa .
Tomorrow will be a beautiful day.	Qhipürux wali suma uruw utjani.
Instead, he did just that.	Jan ukasti, jupajj ukham luräna.
Who do you think will do it?.	¿Khitis jumajj lurani sasin amuyta?.
So, there’s nothing I can do here right now.	Ukhama, janiw kunas jichhax akan lurañax utjkiti.
We’ll see later.	Uka qhepat uñjañäni.
That was sort of like that.	Ukajj mä jukʼa ukhamänwa.
He said nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kuns siskänti.
What did you think of it.	¿Kunsa jumajj amuyayäta.
But we have three .	Ukampis jiwasax kimsa .
He just does so many things well.	Jupax ukhamakiw walja lurañanak sum luraski.
And in what awkward and unnecessary place.	Ukat kuna jan wali ukat jan wakiskir chiqansa.
There was a place that was sad.	Mä chiqaw utjäna, ukax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
Earlier some money.	Nayraqat mä jukʼa qollqe.
They don't know what it is.	Jupanakajj kunas uk janiw yatipkiti.
That's what he bought.	Ukaw jupajj alasïna.
He’s very popular now.	Jupax jichhax wali uñt’atawa.
Yeah, that’s who you are.	Jïsa, ukax khitis jumatakix wali askiwa.
I thought she was handsome.	Jupajj suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
Yesterday was a hot day out there.	Qharürux uka chiqanx wali junt’u uruw utjäna.
He was a good question.	Jupajj uka jisktʼajj wali sumapunïnwa.
That’s all there really was.	Ukakiw chiqpachapunix utjäna.
Make it your own .	Juman pachpa lurañamawa .
Too much money, actually.	Sinti qullqi, chiqpachansa.
You need to do it faster.	Jukʼamp jankʼakiw lurañama.
He has done so much for us.	Jupajj walpun jiwasatak lurawayi.
This is all weird.	Akax taqpach muspharkañawa.
Except last night.	Jan ukasti qhipa arumax.
It will always take some time.	Sapa kutiw mä jukʼa tiempox munasini.
But he’s doing too much wrong.	Ukampis jupax sinti jan walinak luraski.
That’s good, maybe.	Ukax wali askiwa, inas.
I really don’t see how or why.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa jan ukax kunatsa uk uñjkti.
Would you do that.	¿Jumajj ukham lurasmati.
I want something more.	Nayax juk’amp kuns munta.
Good for you, too!.	¡Jumatakix wali askiwa, ukhamaraki!.
He knew what she thought of him.	Jupajj kunsa jupat amuyäna uk sum yatïna.
It's actually kind of interesting.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa wali askiwa.
I told him no.	Nayax juparux janiw sasaw sista.
Very nice about it.	Wali sumaw uka tuqitxa.
And he almost did it.	Ukat jupax niyaw uk luräna.
But what about that.	Ukampis kunas uka tuqitxa.
Do you better .	Jumajj jukʼamp sumti .
Yes, there are two sides to each.	Jïsa, sapa mayniw pä tuqit utji.
This feels the same for me.	Akax nayatakix ukhamarakiw jikxatasi.
He wasn't that bad about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet ukham jan walinak lurkänti.
But now he had some time.	Ukampis jichhajj mä jukʼa tiempow utjäna.
He really had nowhere to go.	Chiqpachansa janiw kawkirus sarañapatak utjkänti.
Nothing, right now, no one.	Janiw kunas, jichhax, janiw khitis utjkiti.
Well, it’s very clear.	Ukhama, wali qhanawa.
I’m amazed by him every day.	Nayax sapa uruw jupat muspharta.
He likes them very much.	Jupanakajj jupar wal gusti.
He had done this before.	Nayrajj ukham luratayna.
Let’s see where he ended up.	Kawkirus tukuyäna uk uñjañäni.
I see why now.	Kunatsa jichhajj uk uñjta.
And it happened every time.	Ukat sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
There’s everything there.	Ukanx taqi kunaw utji.
It wasn’t like he knew how to navigate this place.	Janiw jupax aka chiqan sarnaqañ yatkaspa ukhamäkänti.
I’m so worried about the cold.	Nayax wali llakitaw thaya tuqitxa.
He was barely sleeping.	Jupajj jukʼakiw ikiskäna.
But he’s busy.	Ukampis jupax jan tiemponiw jikxatasi.
He wasn't there.	Jupajj janiw ukan utjkänti.
I haven’t seen any letter.	Nayax janiw kuna carta uñjkti.
He understands this himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk sum amuyi.
One of these things is wrong.	Ukanakat mayniw jan walinak luraski.
He thought everything about her.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jupat amuyäna.
Well, you tell us first.	Ukhama, jumaw nayraqat yatiyapxita.
And there is a certain amount of space in each.	Ukat sapa mayniw mä jukʼa chiqaw utji.
Everything but me, of course.	Taqi kunat sipansa nayat sipansa, chiqpachansa.
He seemed to know.	Jupajj yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
Now, it’s funny.	Jichhax, wali muspharkañawa.
He phoned twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw telefonot jawsäna.
He knew why.	Jupax kunatsa uk yatïna.
You have to do something about it.	Uka tuqitxa jumax kuns lurañamawa.
He was no one like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham khitis utjkänti.
It was about something unimportant.	Ukajj mä jan wakiskir toqet parläna.
He had no idea what the future held.	Jutïrin kunas pasani uk janiw amuykänti.
So don't do that.	Ukhamajj jan uk luramti.
Everything looks right.	Taqi kunas chiqapar uñtatawa.
This isn’t going anywhere.	Akax janiw kawkirus sarkiti.
He does everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa luri.
It’s also a bad guy.	Ukhamaraki mä jan wali jaqiwa.
I’m going to go to university.	Nayax jach’a yatiqañ utar sarañ amtasta.
So this is not possible.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj lurañjamäkiti.
People can’t afford to move.	Jaqinakax janiw yaqha chiqar sarxañ qullqix utjkaspati.
He really didn't want her to do that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham lurañap munkänti.
Each one was necessary.	Sapa mayniw wakisïna.
No one knows what really happened to him.	Kunas chiqpachapuni jupar pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
He does things on his own.	Jupajj jupa pachpaw kuns luri.
You’ve done it yourself.	Juma pachpaw lurawayta.
I want to say something very important.	Nayax wali wakiskir arunak arsuñ munta.
That is why they are nothing.	Ukatwa jupanakajj jan kunäkisa.
It is not necessary now.	Jichhax janiw wakiskiti.
He will come on his own.	Jupa pachpaw jutani.
Somehow, it never happens.	Kunjamatsa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
With good sense of course.	Suma amuyumpiw chiqpachansa.
We are interested in this.	Jiwasax aka tuqitx wali askiwa.
Kind of cold, but otherwise okay.	Mä juk’a thaya, ukampis yaqha tuqitx walikïskiwa.
Now I never knew how he felt before.	Jichhajj janipuniw nayrajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk yatkti.
He was about my size and handsomeness.	Jupajj niya nayan jachʼa ukat suma jaqënwa.
Everything was about me.	Taqe kunas nayat parläna.
He did yesterday, actually.	Jupax qharüruw ukham luratayna, chiqpachansa.
It arrived a couple of days ago.	Mä pä urunak nayraw purinïna.
And that’s that and that.	Ukat ukax ukat uka.
I mean that’s something.	Nayax ukax mä kunaw sañ munta.
I would use this again.	Nayax akax wasitat apnaqañ munta.
I’m not going to repeat that here.	Nayax janiw ukanak akanx mayamp arsuñ munkti.
There is no rain.	Janiw jallux utjkiti.
And great, there will be something.	Ukat jach’a, kunas utjani.
Also today.	Ukhamaraki jichhürunakanxa.
He’s a really great guy.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali jach’a jaqiwa.
If you want to see it, you have to put in the effort.	Uñjañ munsta ukhaxa, ukaruw chʼamachasiñama.
It was the first time anyone had really seen him.	Ukaw nayrïr kuti khitis jupat chiqpachapuni uñjäna.
Now he wanted to ride there.	Jichhax uka chiqar kayuk sarañ munäna.
So it's very exciting for me.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj wali kusiskañawa.
There is no charge for this.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.
I didn’t expect anything.	Janiw kunas suykayätti.
You will have everything.	Jumax taqi kunaw utjani.
Someone else there told me.	Ukan yaqha jaqejj akham sasaw sitäna.
I think he’s good.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali askiwa.
But for you .	Ukampis jumatakix .
You’re either a lightweight, or you’re not.	Jumax mä llamp’u jaqiwa, jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Or someone did somehow.	Jan ukajj mayniw kunjamatsa ukham luräna.
He can get the ball from anywhere.	Jupax kawkhans pelot apsuñ yati.
As it has always been.	Kunjamtï nayratpach utjki ukhama.
But you are that person.	Ukampis jumajj uka jaqïtawa.
He said he knew it.	Jupajj uk yattwa sasaw säna.
Once a week is fine.	Semanan mä kutix walikïskiwa.
I started small.	Nayax jisk’a jisk’a qalltawayta.
It’s not all night.	Janiw taqpach arumax utjkiti.
A longer two years.	Mä juk’amp jaya pä mara.
I know what it's like.	Nayajj kunjamsa uk yattwa.
I told him goodnight.	Nayax juparux suma arumaw sista.
You mean the truth.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw sañ munta.
This does not mean doing nothing.	Ukajj janiw jan kun lurañ sañ munkiti.
He called her the day before.	Jupajj mä uru nayraw jupar jawsäna.
There is no time limit on this.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
But I don’t know yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax yatkti.
He’s known now.	Jupax jichhax uñt’atawa.
Foolish for me.	Nayatakix loqhe.
But it’s okay, really.	Ukampis walikïskiwa, chiqpachansa.
I really understand that.	Chiqpachansa nayax uk sum amuyta.
He needs to do something worse.	Jupajj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
There wasn't a whole lot to do.	Janiw taqe lurañajj utjkänti.
Too much coffee, no coffee.	Sinti café, janiw café.
He did what he was told.	Kuntï siskäna uk luräna.
He obviously can't do that anymore.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp ukham lurkaspati, ukajj qhanawa.
But nowadays it is very rare.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, wali jukʼakiw utji.
I know that's the case.	Nayajj ukham yattwa.
Well, nobody does it.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis uk lurkiti.
I don’t want to be indifferent.	Nayax janiw jan kuns lurir jaqir tukuñ munkti.
No, no one has ever done that before.	Janiwa, janiw khitis nayrajj ukham lurkänti.
Kind of bad.	Mä kasta jan wali.
He speaks the word carefully.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw uka aru arsu.
It was a terrible night.	Mä jan wali arumaw utjäna.
But nobody does anything.	Ukampis janiw khitis kuns lurkiti.
But this is a lot of fun.	Ukampis akax wali kusiskañawa.
He was the one who stole.	Jupaw lunthatasïna.
They know how to work that way.	Jupanakax ukham irnaqañ yatipxi.
I want to do that soon.	Nayax uka jank’ak lurañ munta.
He walked for a long time.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow sarnaqäna.
He started it again.	Jupaw wasitat qalltäna.
He knew exactly how she felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk sum yatïna.
He immediately felt the worst.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jukʼamp jan walinak amuyäna.
He was alone, all alone.	Jupax sapakiw jikxatasïna, taqpach sapakiw jikxatasïna.
No one else can do that for me.	Janiw khitis nayatakejj ukham lurkaspati.
Of course no one said anything.	Chiqansa janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
I’m definitely doing that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw ukham luraskta.
But that's all he does.	Ukampis ukakiw jupajj luraski.
The ride was wonderful.	Uka autot sarañajj wali sumapunïnwa.
It looks hot.	Ukax junt’u uñtatawa.
Everything is good for you .	Taqi kunas jumatakix wali askiwa .
He understood it more and more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw uk amuyäna.
Thank you all very, very much.	Taqiniruw wali, walpun yuspärta.
No one had any reason to go there.	Janiw khitis uka cheqar sarañatak kuna razonas utjkänti.
I don't think that's a good thing.	Nayatakejj janiw ukajj wali askïkiti.
But something went wrong.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis utjawayi.
You are an older woman.	Jumax mä jilïr warmiwa.
Now he decides to do it.	Jichhax lurañ amti.
She felt really good about it.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa wali sumwa jikxatasïna.
He uses it when he needs it.	Jupaw kunapachatï wakiski ukhajj apnaqi.
That’s what he thought.	Ukaw sasaw amuyäna.
Everything was flat.	Taqi kunas ch’uqi satänwa.
That’s singularly exciting to me.	Ukax sapa mayniw nayatakix wali kusiskañawa.
They have no choice, really.	Jupanakax janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
I want to see you outside.	Nayax anqan uñjañ munta.
Or whatever you think would be better.	Jan ukajj kunatï jumajj jukʼamp askïspawa sasin amuykta ukajja.
It doesn't matter what happened to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
What are you feeling.	Kunsa jumajj jikjjatasta.
I didn't know that for a moment.	Mä jukʼa tiempos janiw uk yatkayätti.
That’s not the case this year.	Ukax janiw jichha marax ukhamäkiti.
It took about two hours each time.	Sapa kutiw niya pä horanak munasïna.
So there is time to move on to the next step.	Ukhamajj jutïr cheqar sarañatakiw tiempojj utji.
This required two steps.	Ukatakejj pä lurañaw wakisïna.
I can’t stand anyone.	Janiw khitirus aguantañjamäkiti.
At that point, he could have done anything.	Uka tiemponjja, kunsa luraspäna.
He did a lot of that.	Jupajj walpun ukham luräna.
That ultimately says, not here.	Ukax qhipharux akham siwa, janiw akanx ukhamäkiti.
He said the same thing once or twice.	Mä kuti jan ukax pä kutiw pachpa arunak arsüna.
Or never again.	Jan ukajj janipuniw mayampsa.
I think this one is interesting.	Nayax amuyta akax maynix wali askiwa.
Not a lot of money in it.	Janiw walja qullqix ukan utjkiti.
That's why I like it so much.	Ukatwa nayarojj wal gustitu.
It scares them.	Jupanakar axsarayi.
You don’t have to do anything .	Janiw kuns lurañamäkiti .
He walked away with great force.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw sarjjäna.
Clearly this guy lived alone.	Qhanaw aka waynax sapakiw jakasïna.
Then one day a light came.	Ukat mä urux mä qhanaw purinïna.
I just came from there.	Nayax jichhakiw uka chiqat jutta.
How he used to behave.	Kunjamsa nayrajj sarnaqäna.
It doesn’t matter when something happens.	Ukax kuna pachas kunas pasaspa ukax janiw kunäkisa.
There is a flight at noon.	Chika urux mä avión ukaw utji.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj nayarojj walpun munasïna.
It’s such a big chunk of snow.	Ukhama jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But an important thing.	Ukampis mä wakiskir kuna.
I just got it right now.	Jichhakiw ukax jikxatasi.
He was good last night.	Jupax qhipa arumax wali suma jaqiwa.
One needs some resources for that.	Maynix ukatakix mä qawqha yänak munaraki.
Not really a good one.	Janiw chiqpachansa mä suma.
He sat down immediately.	Ukat jankʼakiw qontʼasïna.
I enjoyed the moment.	Nayax uka pachax wali sumaw uñjta.
Nobody likes you.	Janiw khitis jumar gustkiti.
It’s what I actually saw.	Kuntï cheqpachapun uñjkta ukawa.
He leaves her alone.	Jupajj sapak jaytawayi.
And there isn’t.	Ukat janiw utjkiti.
And they are very good at it.	Ukat jupanakax wali sumwa uka tuqit yatipxi.
Too bad that day not today.	Sinti jan waliw uka urux janiw jichhürunakanxa.
Maybe you want to use a long one.	Inas jumax mä jaya apnaqañ munsta.
But it’s amazing to get there.	Ukampis uka chiqat puriñkamax wali muspharkañawa.
I find that exciting.	Ukajj kusiskañawa sasaw amuyasta.
But there was one day .	Ukampis mä uruw utjäna .
I really just did something.	Chiqpachansa, jichhakiw kuns lurawayta.
Anyway, he did that.	Kawkhansa, jupax ukham luratayna.
A tiny little something.	Mä jisk’a jisk’a kuns.
And another, bigger one.	Ukat yaqha, juk’amp jach’a.
He was better than me.	Jupajj nayat sipansa jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
That's pretty cool to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj wali sumawa.
I will not harm you.	Janiw nayajj jumar jan wal lurkäti.
But it hit him hard.	Ukampis ukajj jupar walpun chʼalljjtayasïna.
He seems to be very happy about it.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatasi sasaw amuyasi.
Maybe something or nothing.	Inas kunas jan ukax janis kunas utjaspa.
He said something to her.	Jupajj mä kunsa jupar säna.
I'm okay with it.	Nayax walikïskiti.
One or two almost as good as him.	Mä jan ukax pä niya jupar uñtasit wali suma.
I like the power.	Nayatakix ch’amaw gustitu.
He didn't want to come alone.	Jupajj janiw sapak jutañ munkänti.
But he wanted to know.	Ukampis jupajj yatiñwa munäna.
So he told her about it.	Ukatwa jupajj jupar yatiyäna.
This happened about once every two weeks.	Ukajj niya pä semanan mä kutiw pasäna.
It doesn’t really work for me.	Nayatakix janiw chiqpachansa irnaqkiti.
Except it’s just now.	Jan ukasti jichhakiw utji.
The same may be necessary.	Uka pachpajj inas wakischispa.
So I don't want to do that anymore.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp ukham lurañ munkti.
It was obvious that he had his full attention on her.	Jupajj jupar taqe chuymaw chuym churäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I see real good.	Nayax chiqpach suma uñjta.
I come here every year.	Nayax sapa maraw akan jutta.

He actually did something.	Chiqpachansa jupax kuns luratayna.
And whatever it is.	Ukat kunas ukhamawa.
Honestly, it was a lot of fun.	Chiqpachansa, wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
Someone came to him.	Mayniw jupar purinïna.
An unknown thing.	Mä jan uñt’at kuna.
That's what he has for it.	Ukatakejj kunatï jupajj utjki ukawa.

Not so cold.	Janiw ukhama thaya.

What you do is more important than you know.	Kuntï lurkta ukajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa, janiw yatkayätati.
I can’t stand the sight now.	Jichhax janiw uka uñjañ aguantañjamäkiti.
Important, of course.	Wali wakiskiriwa, chiqpachansa.
It’s the latter.	Ukax qhipa uñt’atawa.
I don’t remember it happening.	Janiw ukanak pasañap amtaskti.
I didn’t understand it until now.	Janiw jichhakamax amuykayätti.
That’s really all you need.	Chiqpachansa, ukakiw jumatakix wakisispa.
I went to his place that night.	Uka arumax jupan utaparuw sarawayta.
I want to go into his house.	Nayax jupan utapar mantañ munta.

He did everything right, but that was it.	Taqi kuns sum luräna, ukampis ukakiw luräna.
And not anywhere else.	Ukat janiw kawkhansa.
Made some food.	Mä juk’a manq’a luratayna.
He himself means nothing.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kuns sañ munkiti.
He wanted out so he left.	Jupax mistuñ munäna ukatwa sarxäna.
Or he didn't act fast enough.	Jan ukajj janiw jankʼak kuns lurkänti.
He knows what the country has to offer.	Jupajj kunanakas uka markan utji uk sum yati.
Three-dimensional snowflakes.	Kimsa ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
It’s also very difficult.	Ukhamaraki wali ch’amawa.
But he said it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk sänwa.
Maybe you shouldn't do that.	Inas jan ukham lurañax wakischispa.
Not available this month.	Janiw aka phaxsinx utjkiti.
And he’s absolutely right.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw chiqaw sañ muni.
He didn't understand how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw sum amuykänti.

But really, he knew better.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, jupax jukʼamp sum yatïna.
You want to eat and eat and eat.	Jumax manq’añ munta ukat manq’añ munta ukat manq’añ munta.
I don’t know anything about him, really.	Janiw jupat kuns yatkti, chiqpachansa.

And he knew it.	Ukat uk yatïna.

I know it would be good for me.	Nayax yattwa, ukax nayatakix wali askïspawa.
But it’s still a long way to go.	Ukampis wali jaya pachaw sarañapa.
The same two snowflakes.	Uka pachpa pä ch’uqi.
He knew a lot about me.	Jupajj nayat wal yatïna.
He just feels like that for me.	Jupax nayatakix ukhamakiw jikxatasi.
So he said these words.	Ukatwa jupajj uka arunak säna.
He didn't want a thing.	Jupajj janiw mä kunsa munkänti.
But he would do anything to help anyone.	Ukampis taqe chuymaw khitirus yanaptʼañatakejj kunsa luraspäna.
In fact, that’s exactly what happened.	Chiqansa, ukax chiqpachapuniw pasäna.
Let’s see how things unfold.	Kunjamsa kunas pasaski uk uñjañäni.
Long ago he learned to play the piano.	Walja tiempo nayraw piano tocañ yatïna.
Now it’s time for that.	Jichhax uka pacharuw purini.
No one knows what the future holds.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
This house is	Aka utax .
Once in a while later.	Mä kuti qhepatjja.
He is the one who.	Jupaw uka...
You don’t have to walk a foot.	Janiw mä kayuk sarañax wakiskiti.
And, yes he is good.	Ukat, jïsa jupax wali askiwa.
I hope to come there again one day.	Mä urux wasitat ukar jutañ suyt’askta.
I prefer to do real bad things myself.	Naya pachpaw chiqpach jan walinak lurañax jukʼamp munta.
He said he knew everything better.	Jupajj taqe kunwa jukʼamp yatta sasaw säna.
These are urgently needed.	Ukanak jankʼakiw munasi.
But he said it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw uk arsüna.
You’ve got the chance.	Jumax uka ch’amampiw jikxatastaxa.
Great box, box.	Jach’a ukaxa, ukaxa.
I’m planning on staying the night with him.	Nayax jupamp chikaw uka arumax qhiparañ amtaskta.
Wine and blood.	Vino ukat wila.
The best part is that it’s unique.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax jan uñt’atawa.
A kind heart, if you will.	Mä suma chuyma, jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
I asked after him.	Nayajj jupar qhepatwa jisktʼasta.
That was clearly a nonsense.	Ukajj qhanaw mä jan wali arunak parläna.
I thought that was the best thing ever.	Ukajj taqe kunat sipansa wali sumawa sasaw amuyayäta.
He didn't want to rush it.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak lurañ munkänti.
And he gave it to her.	Ukat jupaw uk churäna.
He vehemently denied it.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw uka toqet jan iyaw säna.
He knows he is a bad guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqëtap yati.
He doesn't understand what you want.	Jupajj janiw kuntï munkta uk amuykiti.
You absolutely can.	Jumax chiqpachapuniw lurasma.
It didn’t exist at the time.	Janiw uka pachan utjkänti.
No one wanted me.	Janiw khitis nayar munkänti.
It feels so much better than doing nothing.	Ukajj jan kun lurañat sipansa wali sumaw jikjjatasi.
That this is nothing at the moment.	Uka akax janiw kunas jichha pachanx utjkiti.
Or so it seems to me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj ukhamwa uñjasi.
But he says that’s not the case.	Ukampis jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw saraki.
What a beautiful day.	Kunjamsa wali suma uru.
It’s all worth doing.	Ukax taqpach lurañax wali askiwa.
It wasn’t, of course.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, chiqpachansa.
Two things are necessary.	Pä kunaw wakisi.
I don't know how he could have done it.	Kunjamsa uk luraspäna uk janiw yatkti.
He’s a tall, thin man.	Jupax jach’a, jisk’a jaqiwa.
Today, he doesn't do that.	Jichha tiemponjja, janiw ukanak lurkiti.
I can’t find anyone.	Janiw khitirus jikxatkti.
The important thing is that this is not the case.	Ukajj wali wakiskiriwa, ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
If you don't have a permit.	Ukax janiw mä permiso ukan utjkiti.
Many people do not know anything about it.	Walja jaqenakajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatipkiti.
In a way it is.	Mä chiqanx ukhamawa.
At the time, he was very happy.	Uka tiemponjja, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But it's a very difficult time for me.	Ukampis uka tiempojj nayatakejj wali chʼamakiwa.

It was almost too good to be true.	Niya wali sumwa amuyasïna.
I don't really want to talk to him.	Janiw chiqpachapuni jupamp parltʼañ munkti.
There is no cost to attend.	Uka tantachäwir sarañatakix janiw kuna qullqis utjkiti.

I feel comfortable in the big city.	Jach’a markanx wali sumaw jikxatastxa.
Report it to the police.	Policiaruw yatiyañama.
He never wants to talk.	Jupajj janipuniw parlañ munkiti.
And he wasn’t like that.	Ukat jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
This is immediately apparent.	Ukax jank’akiw uñjasi.
I didn’t mean either way.	Janiw nayax uka pä tuqitxa sañ munkayätti.

Don’t do it alone.	Janiw sapak lurañamäkiti.
He saw it all himself.	Jupa pachpaw taqi ukanak sum uñjäna.

He was right about you.	Jupajj jumat cheqapuniw säna.
Me, I say so to myself.	Naya, naya pachpaw ukham sista.
Now he thinks he doesn't mean that.	Jichhax janiw ukham sañ munkiti sasaw amuyi.
That is certainly the case here.	Ukajj cheqapuniw aka cheqan utji.
A little more than everything else.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi taqi kunat sipansa.
He’s always done that.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukham luratayna.

Of course, you are very upset.	Chiqansa, jumax wal llakista.

And the last of you.	Ukat qhipa jumanakan.
You know what he did.	Kuntï lurkäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.

It was a great couple of years there for me.	Ukanx nayatakix mä jach’a pä maraw utjäna.
Really good, too.	Chiqpachansa wali suma, ukhamaraki.

He doesn't know what he's doing himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kunsa luri uk yatkiti.
It happened to me so often.	Nayampejj ukham sapa kutiw ukham pasäna.
The best part is that it’s hard.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax ch’amawa.
It’s definitely a great thing to do!.	¡Chiqpachansa mä jach’a lurañaw wakisi!.
And it looks really good.	Ukat chiqpachansa wali sumaw uñtasi.

And let me know how you feel.	Ukat kunjamsa jikxatasïta uk yatiyapxita.
Who knows what the problem is.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk khitis yati.
It doesn’t mean yes to everything.	Janiw taqi kuns jïsa sañ munkiti.
He goes home alone.	Jupax sapakiw utar sarxi.
He finished it himself.	Jupa pachpaw tukuyäna.
He is not sure what the future holds.	Jupajj kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw sum yatkiti.

And there is nothing he can do.	Ukat janiw kunsa jupajj lurkaspati.
There is nothing important to do.	Janiw kuna wakiskir lurañas utjkiti.

He looked both ways.	Jupajj panpachaniw uñnaqäna.
He didn't know how long.	¿Qhawqha tiempos uk jan yatkänti.
It's coming soon.	Ukajj niyaw purini.
This house is amazing.	Aka utax muspharkañawa.
He wanted to know what was what.	Kunas kunas uk yatiñ munäna.
You have to do it now.	Jichhax lurañamawa.
He usually tells the truth.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sañ yati.
On the contrary, it seems that he does not want to do so.	Jan ukasti, janis ukham lurañ munkaspa ukhamawa.
I was a little sad and a little happy.	Nayax mä juk’a llakitaw jikxatasiyäta ukat mä juk’a kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.

There were not that many people.	Janiw ukham walja jaqenakajj utjkänti.
He always has it.	Jupajj sapa kutiw ukanak utji.

So what am I waiting for.	Ukhamajj kunsa suytʼaskta.
And that’s actually fine.	Ukat ukax chiqpachansa walikïskiwa.
Things are either good or bad.	Kunanakas walikïskiwa jan ukajj janiw walïkiti.

But he wanted to do this last one.	Ukampis aka qhep qhepa lurañwa munäna.

And, today was the day.	Ukat, jichhüruw uka urux utjäna.
He’s a very small man.	Jupax wali jisk’a jaqiwa.

You will need both.	Panpachaniw munasini.

He doesn't want to do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns lurañ munkiti.
He wanted it more than he wanted it.	Jupajj kuntï munkäna ukat sipansa jukʼampiw uk munäna.
He is passionate about this.	Jupax aka tuqitx wali munasiñampiw sarnaqaski.
Let us know what you think .	Kuntï jumajj amuykta uk yatiyapjjeta .
Or did something.	Jan ukajj kuns luräna.

He was determined to do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sum lurañwa amtäna.
I told him something would happen to him.	Kunas jupar pasani sasaw sista.
I want to give everything.	Nayax taqi kuns churañ munta.
He didn't say or do anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns arskänti ni kunsa lurkänti.
He never means exactly what he says.	Jupajj janipuniw kuntï siski uk sum sañ munkiti.
You’re pretty good about it.	Jumax uka tuqitx wali sumaw jikxatastaxa.
This happened much later.	Ukajj jukʼamp qhepatwa pasäna.
You may feel that this is not for you.	Inas ukajj jan jumatak askïkaspas ukham amuyasta.
What more do you want.	Kunas jukʼamp munasma.
Never had one inside.	Janipuniw mä manqhan utjkänti.
It meant goodnight.	Ukajj suma arumaw sañ munäna.
He wanted to walk around.	Jupax uka chiqan sarnaqañ munäna.
He didn’t do anything, he didn’t say anything.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkänti, janiw kuns siskänti.
They didn’t have anything.	Jupanakax janiw kunas utjkänti.
I didn’t know how to control him.	Janiw kunjamsa jupar apnaqañ yatkayätti.
He didn't know what time it was.	Janiw kuna horasas uk yatkänti.
I have no idea where it went.	Kawkirus saräna uk janiw amuykti.
But he said he was happy to see me.	Ukampis nayar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw säna.
That’s all there is.	Ukaw taqpach utji.
It wasn't what he meant.	Janiw kuntï jupajj sañ munkäna ukhamäkänti.
He had no previous problems.	Jupajj nayrajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
This house is perfect for me.	Aka utax nayatakix wali askiwa.
Well, that’s it for me.	Ukhama, nayatakix ukhamawa.

I’ve been going all the time, of course.	Nayax sapa kutiw sarawayta, chiqpachansa.
It was still more interesting.	Wali juk’ampi sumapunïnwa.
That’s because he knows he has no choice.	Ukax kunatix jupax yatiw janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti.
I am especially worried about that.	Uka tuqitxa jukʼampiw llakista.
I think time is of the essence.	Nayax amuyta, pachax wali wakiskiriwa.
So what was the problem.	Ukhamajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna.

He loved her, nothing more.	Jupajj jupar wal munäna, janiw jukʼamp munkänti.
It took a really long time.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya tiempow sarnaqäna.

You want more clarity for yourself.	Jumax juk’amp qhanaw jumatakix munta.

And nobody did that.	Ukat janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.

Never never ever.	Janipuniw janipuniw kunapachas.
Very excited about it, too.	Wali kusisitaw uka tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
Many times he left in deep sorrow.	Walja kutiw wali llakitaw sarjjäna.
But it took many, many hours.	Ukampis walja, walja horanakaw munasïna.
It’s a little bit of a slow motion.	Mä juk’a uñtatawa.
He wondered why he didn't.	Kunatsa jan ukham lurkta sasaw jisktʼasïna.
I will never go anywhere else.	Janiw kunapachas yaqha cheqar sarkäti.

Just as he wanted it.	Kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhama.
It’s got a lot of energy to it.	Ukax mä jach’a ch’amampiw ukaruw puri.
I’m pretty happy about it.	Nayax wali kusisitaw uka tuqitxa.

Now he is depressed.	Jichhajj llakitaw jikjjatasi.
What happened last night.	Kunas qhipa arumax pasäna.
If you want it of course.	Jumatix munsta ukhaxa chiqpachansa.
He had no choice but to do so.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti, jan ukasti ukham lurañaw utjäna.
He never told her.	Jupajj janipuniw jupar siskänti.
No one really wanted to do it again.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapuni mayamp lurañ munkänti.
A little snowflake.	Mä jisk’a ch’uqi.
Beer me, and you.	Cerveza naya, ukat juma.
That meant everyone.	Ukax taqiniruw sañ munäna.
It was so obvious at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, ukham qhanaw amuyasïna.
He’s a bit of a celebrity now.	Jupax jichhax mä juk’a uñt’atawa.
That’s not really necessary.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapunix wakiskiti.
Because you do the stupid stuff.	Kunatix jumax uka loqhe lurañanak lurasma.
But that doesn't mean everything.	Ukampis ukajj janiw taqe kunas sañ munkiti.
No one knows all of this.	Janiw khitis taqi ukanak yatkiti.
Now he could do whatever he wanted.	Jichhajj kuntï munkäna uk luraspänwa.
I didn’t plan that.	Nayax janiw ukham amtkti.
I had done something.	Nayajj mä kunwa lurayäta.
What to do, and do it that way.	Kunsa lurañasa, ukat ukham lurañasa.

So that feels good .	Ukhamajj ukajj wali sumwa jikjjatasi .
But the truth is, no one knows.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajja, janiw khitis yatkiti.
He was staring at the coin.	Jupajj uka qollqe uñchʼukiskäna.
Things started like this.	Kunas ukham qalltäna.
Honestly, you can’t do that.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
And all this means nothing.	Ukat taqi ukanakax janiw kuns sañ munkiti.

Hope to see them all this week.	Taqi jupanakar aka semanan uñjañ suyt’askta.

It’s not unbearable or anything.	Janiw jan aguantañjamäkiti ni kunas.

He either loves it or he doesn't.	Jupajj wal munasi jan ukajj janiw munkiti.
Of course, he knew all too well about it.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa wali sumwa yatïna.
I’m also slowing down.	Nayax ukhamarakiw juk’ampi juk’ampi.

He took it out, and she gave it to him.	Jupajj apsüna, ukat jupajj churäna.
He’s not really like that.	Jupax janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkiti.
It is the only way to improve it.	Ukakiw jukʼamp sum lurañatakejj utjaspa.
Something inside you.	Kunas juma manqhan utjäna.

He can't do anything to me.	Jupajj janiw nayarojj kuns lurkaspati.
It always means a great meal together.	Sapa kutiw mä jachʼa manqʼa mayachtʼasis manqʼañ sañ muni.
You weren’t surprised by that.	Jumax janiw uka tuqit muspharkayätti.

Everything is silent.	Taqi kunas amukiw.

He definitely had something.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw kunas utjäna.
Someone else did it.	Mayniw uk luräna.
But it's a little less.	Ukampis mä jukʼa jukʼakiw.
He started the process.	Jupaw uka lurañ qalltäna.
It takes a lot of time to make a film.	Mä película lurañatakix walja tiempow munasispa.
It has a long lifespan.	Ukajj walja tiempow jakasi.
He knew who it was.	Jupajj khitïnsa ukajj uk sum yatïna.
He never quite understood.	Jupajj janipuniw sum amuykänti.
He didn't know why.	Jupajj kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkänti.
And he almost never did anything.	Ukat niya janipuniw kuns lurkänti.
But ultimately, that doesn't matter.	Ukampis qhepatjja, ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
Chopsticks and heart.	Ch’uqi ch’uqi ukat chuyma.

He was doing very bad things.	Jupajj wali jan walinak luraskäna.
Nobody repeats anything.	Janiw khitis kuns mayamp mayamp lurkiti.
He went with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw saräna.
The man wasn't like that.	Uka jaqejj janiw ukhamäkänti.
But I personally think so.	Ukampis naya pachpaw ukham amuyta.
I wanted to know what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna uk yatiñwa munta.
Which, of course, he doesn’t.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, jupax janiw ukham lurkiti.
He took the bad stuff out.	Jan walinak apsüna.

This was not such a problem.	Ukajj janiw ukham jan waltʼäwejj utjkänti.
But it doesn’t exist here.	Ukampis janiw aka cheqan utjkiti.
Why was he doing this.	Kunatsa ukham luraskäna.
He didn’t think he’d ever do that.	Jupax janiw kunapachas ukham lurani sasin amuykänti.
I think it’s really good.	Chiqpachansa wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Everything else’.	Taqi kuna’.
I’ve never had the night.	Janiw kunapachas arumax utjkituti.
Of course he can do that.	Chiqpachansa jupax ukham luraspa.
I want to drink that water.	Nayax uka uma umañ munta.
Now he’s really sleepy.	Jichhax jupax chiqpachapuniw ikiñan jikxatasi.
I want to see the possibilities.	Nayax kunanaktï lurañjamäki ukanak uñjañ munta.
And he spoke up.	Ukat jupajj parläna.
And we have a really nice day last week.	Ukat mä chiqpach suma uruw pasïr semanan utjistu.
He wanted it with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw munäna.
Really, things happened.	Chiqpachansa, kunanakas pasäna.
He saw exactly how it happened now.	Kunjamsa jichhajj pasäna uk sum uñjäna.
Nothing could be worse.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp jan walinak utjkaspati.
That doesn’t matter right now.	Ukax janiw jichhax kunäkisa.
But I just don't know how.	Ukampis nayajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatkti.
I thought that was good enough.	Nayax ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
I never knew what to do with myself.	Janipuniw naya pachpat kun lurañsa yatkayätti.
He’s very rare, you know.	Jupax wali juk’akiw, jumax yatisktawa.
He used to be .	Jupajj nayrajj ukhamänwa .
After that, he didn't know for sure.	Uka qhepatjja, janiw sum yatkänti.
I think that’s all we have to do.	Nayax amuyta, ukakiw lurañasa.
I’ve done a lot of it.	Nayax walpun lurawayta.
There is no reason .	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti .
And they might as well.	Ukat jupanakax inas ukhamaraki.
There is nothing more.	Janiw jukʼamp utjkiti.
He almost did that.	Jupax niyaw ukham luratayna.
Rather, it needs to be done regularly.	Jan ukasti, sapa kuti lurañaw wakisi.
I know there is day, there is night.	Nayax yattwa uruw utji, arumaw utji.
Sees it as it really is.	Kunjamtï cheqäki ukham uñji.
A little about him .	Jupat mä jukʼa .
Money speaks volumes.	Qullqix walpun arsu.
The man was already staring at her.	Uka jaqejj niyaw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
I don't quite believe that.	Nayajj janiw uk sum creykti.
He wants to do something about it.	Jupajj uka toqet kun lurañwa muni.
You don’t have to do it in every way.	Janiw taqi tuqit lurañax wakiskiti.
He’d done it once.	Jupax mä kutiw ukham luratayna.
But now, somehow, I didn’t like it very much.	Ukampis jichhax, kunjamatsa, janiw sinti gustkänti.
He thought this was supremely beautiful.	Jupax akax wali jach’a sumaw sasaw amuyäna.
So he did it again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa luräna.
I don’t remember word for word.	Janiw arut arut amtaskti.
And a scary one.	Ukat mä axsarkañ mä.
That’s how he died.	Ukhamaw jupajj jiwjjäna.
What’s there is beautiful.	Kunatix utjki ukax wali sumawa.
I let him do it.	Nayax juparux uk lurañapatakiw jaytawayta.
So he refused to come to her again.	Ukatwa wasitat jupar jutañ jan munkänti.
So he could have done it, but he didn't want to.	Ukhamajj jupajj luraspänwa, ukampis janiw munkänti.
I’ve never seen anything like him.	Janipuniw jupar uñtasit kuns uñjkti.
I don’t see much of that, really.	Nayax janiw uka tuqitx walpun uñjkti, chiqpachansa.
But there is little.	Ukampis jukʼakiw utji.
I have a little more to do with it.	Nayax mä juk’a juk’amp lurañaw uka tuqit utjitu.
But there was definitely something there.	Ukampis cheqapuniw kunas ukan utjäna.
I just want to do that.	Nayax ukhamakiw ukham lurañ munta.
Nothing seems to work so far.	Jichhakamax janiw kunas askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
He’s going with me.	Jupax nayamp chikaw saraski.
There is no minimum or maximum amount.	Janiw mä jisk’a jan ukax mä jach’a qullqix utjkiti.
But on the contrary, he was very cautious.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, jupajj wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
Or what almost happened.	Jan ukajj kunatï niyaw paskäna ukajja.
He wants to eat, yes.	Jupax manq’añ muni, jïsa.
I’m already doing that.	Nayax niyaw ukham luraskta.
That’s what made him valuable.	Ukaw jupar wali askit uñjäna.
He loves it so much.	Ukham walpun munasi.
But I’m still watching it.	Ukampis nayax wali sum uñjta.
I really don’t want to.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw jan munkti.
I saw a guy in the distance.	Mä waynaruw jaya chiqat uñjta.
If you don’t like it, that’s fine.	Jumatix jan munkta ukhax walikïskiwa.
He needs it immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw munasi.
Or it needs to be done.	Jan ukajj lurañaw wakisi.
I did it myself, obviously.	Naya pachpaw uk lurawayta, qhanawa.
That was today.	Ukax jichhüruw utjäna.
That’s how it all started.	Ukhamaw taqi kunas qalltäna.
I’m really sorry, actually.	Chiqpachansa llakistwa, chiqpachansa.
You really don’t want to work there.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukan irnaqañ munktati.
But there was more to him.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼampiw ukan utjäna.
I don't know how long it will last.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj utjani uk janiw yatkti.
In a positive way.	Mä suma tuqitxa.
I don’t know you.	Nayax janiw jumax yatkti.
I never wanted to do anything.	Janipuniw kuns lurañ munkayätti.
But that would do nothing.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
It’s certainly not a bad thing.	Chiqansa janiw jan walïkiti.
Never ever, ever.	Janipuniw kunapachas, janipuniw.
He’s fine, of course.	Jupax walikïskiwa, chiqpachansa.
He agreed and immediately went to work.	Jupajj iyaw sänwa ukat jankʼakiw irnaqäwir sarjjäna.
But he can't do it.	Ukampis janiw jupajj lurkaspati.
A little too much, actually.	Mä juk’a sinti jach’a, chiqpachansa.
I asked him why he wanted to do that.	Kunatsa ukham lurañ munta sasaw jisktʼta.
It doesn’t matter, but he knows.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, ukampis jupax yati.
The next day he did the same.	Qhipürux ukhamarakiw luratayna.
He didn't do that.	Janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.
She loves books.	Jupajj libronak wal munasi.
That was the case, he said.	Ukhamänwa sasaw jupajj säna.
But it wasn’t, it was something else.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, yaqha ukhamänwa.
There’s nothing this guy can’t do.	Janiw kunas aka waynax jan lurañjamäkiti.
That was a year ago .	Ukajj mä mara nayraw pasäna .
I’m happy about it now.	Jichhax uka tuqit kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
What is the source of the problem?.	¿Kunas uka tuqitxa?.
You know, just this one time.	Jumax yatisktawa, aka mä kutikiw.
You are everything to me.	Jumax nayatakix taqi kunas.
He never knew her full name.	Jupajj janipuniw taqpach sutip yatkänti.
I guess this isn’t really good.	Nayax amuyta akax janiw chiqpachapunix askïkiti.
These do not hold true in this case.	Ukanakax janiw aka tuqitx chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
Now I know that .	Jichhajj uk yattwa .
Tonight’s dinner is on your own.	Jichha arumax manq’añax juma pachpaw utji.
Everything the way you want it, the better.	Taqi kunas kunjamtï munkta ukhama, jukʼamp askiwa.
Because this isn’t the case.	Kunatix akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
The trouble started when he left.	Jupajj sarjjäna ukhaw jan waltʼäwejj qalltäna.
I didn’t want all of that.	Janiw taqe ukanak munkayätti.
I'm not going to town tomorrow.	Nayajj janiw qharürojj markar sarkäti.
It’s becoming more popular, too.	Ukax juk’amp uñt’atawa, ukhamaraki.
And he did it well.	Ukat uk sumwa luräna.
I don’t know all that.	Janiw taqe ukanak yatkti.
In fact, there is everything about the product.	Chiqansa, uka yänak tuqitxa taqi kunaw utji.
It’s an amazing thing to do with a book.	Mä libro lurañax wali muspharkañawa.
I am so grateful for his work.	Jupan luratapat walpun yuspärta.
He could not attend.	Jupajj janiw ukar sarañ puedkänti.

He wanted to make coffee before he left.	Jupajj janïr sarkasajj café lurañwa munäna.
Everyone knows what money is.	Taqinipuniw yatipxi kunas qullqix ukxa.
It’s been a really amazing day.	Chiqpachansa wali muspharkañ uruw utjawayi.

Or something more important.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp wakiskir kunsa lurasma.
In fact, there was a brother.	Chiqpachansa, mä jilataw utjäna.
So yeah, it's okay.	Ukhamajj jïsa, walikïskiwa.

More surprisingly, it’s really fun.	Juk’amp muspharkañawa, chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
He could have done anything.	Jupax kuns luraspänwa.

He seemed to be human.	Jupajj jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.

I really love it all.	Chiqpachansa taqi ukanak walpun munasta.
He rode hard and fast.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw ukat wali chʼamampiw kayuk saräna.
I’m more disappointed it never happened.	Nayax juk’amp llakitaw jikxatasiyäta janipuniw ukhamäkänti.

Do whatever you can.	Kuntï kuns lurañjamäki uk luram.
No, he replied, or better yet.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj säna, jan ukajj jukʼamp askiwa.
Nobody wants to see that.	Janiw khitis uk uñjañ munkiti.
But it takes years to do so.	Ukampis ukanak lurañatakejj walja maranakaw pasaski.
I definitely plan to do it again.	Chiqpachansa wasitat lurañ amtasta.
There was no such thing now.	Jichhajj janiw ukham lurañajj utjkänti.
But now there was no one there.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw khitis ukan utjkänti.
You have to do this first.	Uk nayraqat lurañamawa.

Who knew how long it would last.	Khitis qhawqha tiempos utjani uk yatïna.

And that’s because .	Ukat ukax ukhamawa kunatix .

But I didn't know how.	Ukampis kunjamsa uk janiw yatkayätti.
Of course, no one did.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis uk lurkänti.
Many times he decides to quit.	Walja kutiw jaytañ amti.

That he meant yes.	Ukax jupax jïsa sañ munäna.

You think you know, of course.	Jumax yatisktawa sasin amuyta, chiqpachansa.
But there was something more important.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp wakiskir kunaw utjäna.
I said to myself, yesterday, definitely yesterday.	Nayax naya pachpaw sista, qharüru, chiqpachapuniw qharüru.
I’d like to stay that way for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw ukham qhiparañ munta.

Nothing here was much of anything.	Janiw kunas akanx sinti kunas utjkänti.
That's a little uncomfortable.	Ukajj mä jukʼa jan walïkiti.

And then he did just that.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ukhamarakiw jupajj luräna.
This is because once they.	Ukax kunatix mä kutix jupanakax...

Everything was still, everything was quiet.	Taqi kunas wali ch’amawa, taqi kunas amukiw jikxatasïna.

He felt it early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwaw ukham jikjjatasïna.
Of course, it sucked.	Chiqansa, ukax chuyma ch’allxtayäna.

But that is important to me.	Ukampis ukajj nayatakejj wali wakiskiriwa.

There are no things that can be done.	Janiw kunanakas utjkaspati.

You are essential to the making of this book.	Aka libro lurañatakix jumanakax wali wakiskiriwa.
Of course, he can't do that.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw ukham lurkaspati.
I’m afraid that’s wrong.	Nayax axsaratwa ukax janiw walïkiti.

But he means no more than that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkiti.
He refused all of that.	Jupajj taqe ukanak janiw munkänti.
He wanted to help the bad boy.	Uka jan wali waynaruw yanaptʼañ munäna.
Whoever did it.	Khitis uk luratayna.
It’s notoriously difficult.	Ukax wali uñt’atawa ch’amawa.

Always has been, always will be.	Sapa kutiw utjawayi, sapa kutiw utjani.

This gave him many great responsibilities.	Ukaw walja jachʼa lurañanak churäna.
It was as beautiful as he was.	Ukajj jupar uñtasit wali sumapunïnwa.

But it’s only now that it’s really there.	Ukampis jichhakiw chiqpachapunix utji.
He expected more from her.	Jupajj jukʼampiw jupat suyäna.
If you want to do it, just do it.	Uk lurañ munsta ukhaxa, ukhamakiw lurañama.
But there was one thing that was wrong.	Ukampis mä jan waliw utjäna.
That is what you should strive for.	Ukaw jumatakix chʼamachasiñama.
He can do the work.	Jupaw uka lurañanak luraspa.

It is best to do it as you go.	Kunjamtï saraskta ukhamarjam lurañaw jukʼamp askejja.
But he can do both.	Ukampis panpachaniw luraspa.
I really don’t want to go that far.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka jaya chiqar sarañ munkti.
He said with great sadness.	Jupax wali llakitaw säna.

But, it’s still pretty.	Ukampis, wali sumawa.
He can do all of this.	Jupaw taqe ukanak luraspa.
Maybe ten years.	Inas tunka mara.
And he never wanted that.	Ukat janipuniw ukham munkänti.
But that is not to say.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sañjamäkiti.
He asked for nothing more.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp kunsa mayïna.
And he couldn't take his eyes off it.	Ukat janiw nayranakap ukat apsuñ puedkänti.
Except for one, smaller and smaller.	Jan ukasti mä, juk’amp jisk’a ukat jisk’a.

I’d like to know a little bit about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx mä juk’a yatxatañ munta.
This is not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
He could not tell her.	Jupajj janiw ukanak yatiyañ puedkänti.
It’s definitely cooler here now.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw juk’amp thaya akanx jichhax.
He was about to move on.	Jupajj niyaw yaqha cheqar sarañ qalltäna.
He learned by himself.	Jupa pachpaw yateqäna.

He was a robber.	Jupajj lunthatasïna.

But I didn't want to talk to him.	Ukampis janiw jupamp parltʼañ munkayätti.
He refused to give her a job.	Jupajj janiw mä trabajo churañ munkänti.
I know what that meant to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj kunsa sañ munäna uk sum yatta.

No, he didn't know exactly when.	Janiwa, kunapachas uk janiw sum yatkänti.

But I'm still happy with it.	Ukampis nayajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
But he didn't want that to happen anymore.	Ukampis janiw ukajj jukʼamp pasañap munkänti.
So he gave them to her.	Ukatwa ukanak jupar churäna.
But that doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayatakejj kunäkisa.
He’s already .	Jupax niyaw .
Not us, the plane.	Janiw jiwasax, avión.
There is an airplane.	Mä avión ukaw utji.

He finally gives up.	Jupax qhipharux jaytawayi.
You only have to do this once.	Mä kutikiw uka lurañanak lurañama.
I never said a thing about it.	Janipuniw uka toqet mä kuns siskti.
Let us see that this is an important question.	Uka jisktʼajj wali wakiskiriwa, uk uñjañäni.
Don't rush things.	Janiw kuns jankʼak lurañamäkiti.

He knows he doesn't need it.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti uk sum yati.
He chose not to do so.	Jupajj jan uk lurañwa amtäna.

That was the last thing he wanted to do.	Ukaw qhip qhipa lurañ munäna.

You are in a very uncomfortable position.	Jumax wali jan walin jikxatastaxa.

You tell yourself it doesn’t matter.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti sasaw juma pachpa sista.
I don’t want him.	Janiw jupar munkti.
Then he decided what to do.	Ukat kunsa lurani uk amtäna.
But somehow he said that.	Ukampis kunjamatsa ukham säna.
But it is definitely worth the money.	Ukampis chiqpachansa uka qullqix wali askiwa.
So much more exciting.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
Much longer time .	Walja tiempow jukʼamp tiempo .
You came early in the morning.	Jumax wali alwat jutta.
Honestly, all of this would be worth it.	Chiqpachansa, taqi ukanakax wali askïspawa.
He didn't know how long he'd been asleep.	Qhawqha tiempos ikiskäna uk janiw yatkänti.
Every day is a little better.	Sapa urux mä juk’a sumaw uñjasi.

What do you think of this.	¿Kunsa jumajj uka toqet amuyta.
It’s time to leave.	Ukax sarxañ pachaw purini.
Not a lot better, but better.	Janiw walja askïkiti, jan ukasti juk’amp sumawa.
Of course he went himself.	Chiqansa jupa pachpaw saräna.
It’s a very big character.	Mä wali jach’a jaqiwa.
He was a very nice guy, .	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, .
But this is certainly not untrue.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw ukax jan chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
He wanted that big part of her.	Jupax uka jach’a chiqaw jupar munäna.
It’s going to be a great day.	Mä jach’a uruw utjani.
But that is somewhat important.	Ukampis ukajj mä jukʼa wakiskiriwa.
I don't remember much about it.	Janiw uka toqet sinti amtaskti.
But he said much more than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa säna.
I don't particularly like it.	Nayajj janiw ukajj jukʼamp gustkituti.
Something left behind.	Kunas jaytawayi.
No, don't hurt yourself.	Janiwa, jan juma pachpajj jan walinak luramti.
And he’s a whole person.	Ukat jupax taqpach jaqiwa.
He knew exactly how the man felt.	Kunjamsa uka jaqejj jikjjatasïna uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I question everything.	Nayax taqi kuns jiskt’asta.
It was really the only thing I wanted to avoid.	Chiqpachansa, ukakiw jan lurañax sañ munäna.

So you have to tell me.	Ukhamajj jumaw nayar yatiyañama.

He loved her so much.	Juparux walpun munasïna.

It is useful in many ways.	Walja toqet wali askiwa.

But it came quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw purinïna.

If all else is necessary.	Taqi kunas wakisispa ukhaxa.
These things will happen to everyone.	Ukanakax taqiniruw pasani.
He knew something about me.	Jupajj nayat mä jukʼa yatïna.
So yeah, you can't do that.	Ukhamajj jïsa, janiw jumajj ukham lurañjamäkiti.
It is neither he nor she.	Janiw jupajj ni jupajj ukhamäkiti.
He obviously felt it.	Jupax qhanaw ukham jikxatasïna.
But, of course, it’s not.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I don't want to leave him alone.	Nayajj janiw jupar sapak jaytañ munkti.
I really want that.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk munta.
He was walking alone.	Jupajj sapakiw sarnaqäna.
But this is very unnecessary.	Ukampis ukajj wali jan wakiskiriwa.
He did not want to stay here.	Jupajj janiw akan qheparañ munkänti.
The money is amazing.	Qullqix wali muspharkañawa.
I’m going to leave.	Nayax sarxañ amtasta.
But he’s fine, fine.	Ukampis jupax walikïskiwa, walikïskiwa.
And you’re not like that.	Ukat jumax janiw ukhamäkiti.
He would make the first one the best.	Jupaw nayrïr kutin wali suma lurañapatak luraspäna.
I understand that .	Nayax uk amuyasta .

Of course, that’s pretty cool for you.	Chiqansa, ukax jumatakix wali sumawa.
Yes, he knew what was going to happen.	Jïsa, jupajj kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
He expected her to do so.	Jupajj ukham lurañapatakiw suyäna.
I felt really lonely and alone.	Chiqpachansa sapakiw jikxatasiyäta ukat sapakiw jikxatasiyäta.
So that's a very important thing to do.	Ukhamajj ukham lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
I asked him again how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk wasitat jisktʼta.
This one is one of those.	Aka maynix ukanakat maynïriwa.

And no one, really.	Ukat janiw khitis, chiqpachansa.

He told me about him.	Jupaw jupat yatiyäna.
But somehow it doesn't work well.	Ukampis kunjamatsa janiw sum irnaqkiti.
He didn't know exactly what he wanted.	Janiw kuntï munkäna uk sum yatkänti.
I mean myself.	Nayax naya pachpaw sañ munta.
I think they don’t matter.	Nayax amuyta, jupanakax janiw kunäkisa.
You will certainly feel the same way.	Chiqpachansa jumax ukhamarakiw jikxatasïta.
But I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.	Ukampis nayatakix janiw ukax askïkaspas ukham amuyasi.
It went on for a long time.	Ukajj wali jaya tiempow saräna.
He’s a man now.	Jupax jichhax mä jaqiwa.
Except you know.	Jan ukasti jumax yatisktawa.
I need to do that kind of thing.	Nayax uka kasta lurañaw wakisi.
More like a little person.	Mä jisk’a jaqir uñtasit juk’ampi.
Both will happen.	Panpachaniw pasani.
Which, of course, is good.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, wali askiwa.
Far from here.	Aka chiqat jaya.
I know you’ve got that stuff in there somewhere.	Nayax yattwa jumax uka yänak kawkhans ukan jikxatastaxa.
About what you do.	Kuntï lurapkta uka toqet.
Everything was excellent!.	¡Taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa!.
Instead, he walked around the city.	Jan ukasti, markanwa sarnaqäna.
But something told him otherwise.	Ukampis kunas juparux yaqha tuqit yatiyäna.
Too bad that’s true.	Sinti jan waliw ukax chiqpachansa.
I’m curious about this place.	Nayax aka chiqat yatxatañ munta.
He felt better about it.	Jupajj uka toqet jukʼamp sumwa jikjjatasïna.
All of this makes me feel that way.	Taqe ukanak uñjasajj ukhamwa amuyasta.
There are not many people there.	Ukanjja, janiw walja jaqenakajj utjkiti.
As it goes, it gets better.	Ukhama saraski, juk’ampi sumawa.
I felt good about that one.	Nayax uka maynix wali sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
Almost one, he said.	Niya mä, sasaw säna.
They all look terrible.	Taqi ukanakax wali axsarkañ uñnaqaniwa.
So much room.	Ukhama walja cuarto.
He is everything he is right now.	Jupax taqi kunatix jichhax utjki ukawa.
Always wants to know everything.	Sapa kutiw taqi kun yatxatañ muni.
And that rubbed off on me all day.	Ukat ukajj urunakpachaw jan walinak lurayäta.
And he saw them a bit.	Ukat jupanakar mä jukʼa uñjäna.
At one time,	Mä tiemponjja, .
It gets better and better.	Ukax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
Eventually, he did.	Qhepatjja, jupajj uk luräna.
It was a small person.	Ukajj mä jiskʼa jaqënwa.
But that doesn't happen very often.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sinti walja kutix ukhamäkiti.
Of course, something wasn't quite right.	Chiqansa, kunas janiw sum amuyaskänti.
Two years, actually.	Pä mara, chiqpachansa.
Located outside the park.	Ukax parkin anqan jikxatasi.
He appreciated a good meal.	Jupajj mä suma manqʼa wali askit uñjäna.
He wanted something different.	Jupajj yaqha toqetwa munäna.
He’s awesome, he said.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa, sasaw säna.
So he left them.	Ukatwa jupanakar jaytawayi.
And he will leave alone.	Ukat sapakiw sarxani.
No, no, he wasn’t.	Janiwa, janiwa, jupax janiw ukhamäkänti.
He is in a difficult situation.	Mä jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
How he didn’t want to do it.	Kunjamsa jupax jan lurañ munkänti.
He informed them.	Jupaw jupanakar yatiyäna.
He had seen things like this before.	Jupajj nayraw ukham jan walinak uñjäna.
He’s very very slow.	Jupax wali wali ch’amampiw sarxi.
And they’re right about that.	Ukat jupanakax chiqaw uka tuqitxa.
Tell me exactly how it all happened.	Kunjamsa taqe kunas pasäna uk sum yatiyapjjeta.
I want the real thing.	Nayax chiqpach munta.
He had no idea how long.	Jupajj qhawqha tiempos uk janiw amuykänti.
But when the whole process began, no.	Ukampis kunapachatï taqe uka lurañajj qalltäna ukhajja, janiw.
So he loves it.	Ukhamajj jupajj walpun munasi.
He had a great first year.	Jupax nayrïr marax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
And he didn't want it very much.	Ukat jupajj janiw sinti munkänti.
Now he thought he was fine.	Jichhax jupax walikïskiwa sasaw amuyäna.
I didn’t think he’d go that far.	Janiw nayax jupax ukham jaya sarañapatak amuyirïkti.
He knew exactly what had happened.	Kunas pasäna uk sum yatïna.
These often happen in bed.	Ukanakajj walja kutiw ikiñan pasaspa.
I want to do that here, too.	Nayax akan ukham lurañ munta, ukhamaraki.
He received a fee for it.	Ukatakejj mä qollqe katoqäna.
The point is, you always understand.	Uka tuqitxa, jumax sapa kutiw amuyasta.
The house said nothing.	Uka utax janiw kuns arskänti.
He hoped it would never happen again.	Janiw mayamps ukham lurasiñap suyäna.
But there wasn't much time left.	Ukampis janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
But he knew I couldn't do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurirjamäkti, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He knew that this time.	Jupajj jichha kutin uka toqet sum yatïna.
He is the only one who can do it well.	Jupa sapakiw uk sum luraspa.
It’s this and that.	Ukax aka ukat ukax.
I’m taking good care of him.	Nayax juparux sum uñjta.

Either, or not.	Jan ukajj, jan ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
That would be good for me.	Ukax nayatakix wali askïspawa.
I don’t know, what you mean.	Nayax janiw yatkti, kuntix jumax sañ munkta.
I don’t want to leave it aside.	Janiw mä chiqar jaytañ munkti.
That’s why he came here.	Ukatwa jupax aka chiqar jutäna.

He wants me to be.	Jupajj nayaruw munta.
I don’t know anything right now.	Jichhax janiw kuns yatkti.
I just have too much.	Nayax ukhamakiw sinti utjitu.
I knew there would be a lot of wind.	Walja thaya utjani uk sum yatiyäta.
I, of course, love it.	Nayax, chiqpachansa, walpun munasta.
It’s a very big yes.	Wali jach’a jïsa.
He wants everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa muni.
He loves her, he loves everyone.	Jupax juparux munaraki, taqiniruw munaraki.
Now they are .	Jichhax jupanakax .
He’s really great.	Chiqpachansa jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa.
Great big house.	Jach’a jach’a uta.
But tell us a little bit.	Ukampis mä jukʼa yatiyapjjeta.
Now, he doesn’t care.	Jichhax, jupax janiw kuns lurkiti.
I always want to get involved.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukar mantañ munta.
Never stop buying books.	Janipuniw libronak alañ jaytañamäkiti.
I really want to do more, you know.	Chiqpachansa jukʼamp lurañ munta, jumax yatisktawa.
Or that he didn't.	Jan ukajj janiw ukham lurkti sasaw säna.

It felt a little better.	Mä juk’a sumaw jikxatasïna.
These are not currently available.	Ukanakax janiw jichha pachanx utjkiti.
It wasn’t what I wanted.	Janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamäkänti.
There was no us.	Janiw jiwasajj utjkänti.
Every day is a place to go.	Sapa uruw mä chiqar sarañax utji.
Almost too cold.	Niya sinti thaya.
He’s a great character.	Jupax mä jach’a jaqiwa.
This uses water and it.	Akax uma apnaqi ukat ukax.
But he understands it.	Ukampis jupajj ukanak sumwa amuyi.
In fact, the ride was really nice.	Chiqansa, uka autot sarañax chiqpachansa wali sumapunïnwa.
I wish it happened more.	Nayax juk’amp lurasiñap munta.
Everyone knows something about that terrible night.	Sapa mayniw uka jan wali arumax kuns yatipxi.
I saw him there recently.	Jichhakiw ukan jupar uñjta.
It’s still cool, this one.	Wali ch’amawa, akax.
I’m well known in the area.	Nayax uka chiqan wali uñt’atawa.
He is unique and he has a gift.	Jupax jan uñt’atawa ukat jupax mä regalo ukaniwa.
But in his case, he made the right decision.	Ukampis jupa tuqitxa, sumwa amtäna.
I decided not to say anything.	Jan kuns arsuñ amtawayta.
That’s what it all came to.	Ukaw taqpach jutäna.
I want to go there myself.	Naya pachpaw ukar sarañ munta.
It’s been more lonely, actually.	Ukax juk’amp sapakiw utjawayi, chiqpachansa.
I think this is all fascinating.	Nayatakix akax taqi kunas wali muspharkañawa.
I am not sure why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
This is especially important in the winter.	Ukax juyphi pachanx wali wakiskiriwa.
Do everything he says.	Taqe kuntï siski uk luram.
That, that’s better.	Ukax, ukax juk’amp askiwa.
He really needs help.	Chiqpachansa yanaptʼa munasi.
And really, none of that matters.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw kunas ukax wakiskiti.
This year will be worse.	Jichha marax juk’amp jan waliw utjani.
It’s easy to do at any time of the day.	Uka urux kuna pachas lurañax wali ch’amawa.
Small and big heart.	Jisk’a ukat jach’a chuyma.
Same old.	Pachpa nayra.
This gave him .	Ukax juparux .
He didn't know much.	Jupajj janiw wal yatkänti.
Someone told him the secret.	Mayniw uka jamasat yatiyäna.
I see no reason for that.	Ukajj janiw kuna razonas uñjkti.
A few things he was able to do on his own.	Mä qawqha lurañanak jupax jupa pachpaw lurañ yatïna.
But the night is often .	Ukampis arumax walja kutiw .
He meant something to me.	Jupajj nayatakejj kunsa sañ munäna.
I’m sure it’s going to be a long, long time.	Nayax yatxatwa ukax jaya, jaya pachaw utjani.
That could be useful in the future.	Ukaw jutïrin wali askïspa.
He did it here.	Jupaw akan uk luräna.
Gave him a quiet life.	Juparux mä llamp’u jakañ churäna.
Tell me why you love him so much.	Kunatsa jupar wal munasta uk yatiyapxita.
You know how modern it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams jichha pachanx ukhama.
Now he did so carefully.	Jichhajj wali amuyumpiw ukham luräna.
But thankfully, that is not the case.	Ukampis walpun yuspärta, janiw ukhamäkiti.
I want a nice house.	Mä suma uta munta.
There is no single reason.	Janiw mä razonas utjkiti.
He can do a little something.	Jupax mä juk’a kuns luraspa.
It took about three hours.	Ukatakejj niya kimsa horaw munasïna.
I didn't mean to rush you.	Janiw nayajj jumar jankʼak lurañ munkayätti.
He’s a terrible young man.	Jupax wali axsarkañ waynawa.
I will never hurt him again.	Janipuniw mayampsa jupar jan walinak lurkäti.
Of course, he realized that he didn't really want to.	Chiqansa, janiw chiqpachapuni munkänti sasaw amuyasïna.
But I don't think so.	Ukampis janiw nayajj ukham siskti.
I care about you, you know.	Nayax jumat llakistwa, jumax yatisktawa.
Things were much better.	Kunanakas jukʼamp sumapunïnwa.
You have to do it yourself when you get home.	Utar puriñkamax juma pachpaw lurañama.
So he knew all about it.	Ukatwa jupajj taqe ukanak yatïna.
The old snowflakes.	Uka nayra ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He could not eat properly.	Jupajj janiw sum manqʼañ puedkänti.
I mean all of these things.	Nayax taqi ukanak sañ munta.
You said it yourself on the phone.	Juma pachpaw telefonot ukham sista.
There was no way to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw kunas utjkänti.
But there will be no problem.	Ukampis janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
There is no such problem.	Janiw ukham jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
Do this over and over and over again.	Ukjja walja kutiw walja kuti lurañama.
But I can't imagine what he could have done.	Ukampis kunas luraspäna uk janiw amuytʼirjamäkti.
Or another time, if you like.	Jan ukax yaqha kutix, munsta ukhax walikïskiwa.
A very long night.	Mä wali jaya arumaw.
Because that’s the only one.	Kunatix ukax sapa mayniw.
Not this time, and never again.	Janiw aka kutix, ukat janipuniw mayampsa.
Why, this wasn’t the case.	Kunatsa, akax janiw ukhamäkänti.
It really doesn’t do much.	Chiqpachansa janiw sinti lurañjamäkiti.
And you’re the only one.	Ukat juma sapakiw.
I remember it so well.	Ukham sum amtasta.
It was quickly discovered.	Ukajj jankʼakiw jikjjatasïna.
The less he knew about her, the better he knew.	Jupat jukʼamp jan sum yatïna ukhajja, jukʼamp sumwa yatïna.
He feels good about it and wants to go.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali sum jikxatasi ukat sarañ munaraki.
I thought you knew that, already.	Nayax amuyta, jumax uk yatisktawa, nayrax.
I still think you mean that.	Nayax wali amuyta jumax ukham sañ munta.
And that is definitely wrong.	Ukat ukajj cheqapuniw jan walïkiti.
That didn't matter, obviously.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa, qhanaw amuyasïna.
Actually, it’s even better.	Chiqansa, ukax juk’amp sumawa.
That works but it takes a long time.	Ukajj walikïskiwa ukampis wali jaya tiempow munasispa.
It’s known for three things.	Kimsa tuqit uñt’atawa.
I could have done it two ways.	Nayajj pä toqetwa uk luraspäna.
You don’t want to live like that.	Jumax janiw ukham jakañ munktati.

It wasn’t and he felt good about it.	Janiw ukhamäkänti ukat jupax uka tuqitx wali sum jikxatasïna.
That’s why this doesn’t work.	Ukatwa akax jan irnaqkiti.
He felt like he was nothing but a giant.	Jupajj janiw kunäkisa, jan ukasti mä jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I didn’t do much.	Janiw walpun lurkti.

And what time of day it is.	Ukat kuna horasas uka urux utji.
And on the contrary, he was very happy.	Ukat janiw ukhamäkänti, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He wants to do what is right.	Jupajj kunatï walïki uk lurañwa muni.
Of course, we have more.	Chiqansa, jiwasax jukʼampiw utjistu.

It can be very useful .	Ukax wali askïspawa .
I don't like him very much.	Jupajj janiw sinti gustkituti.
But somehow he knew.	Ukampis kunjamatsa jupajj yatïna.
What he wants to do.	Kunsa jupajj munki.

I wanted to tell him that he was important.	Jupajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw jupar sañ munta.
Everything about him was sincere.	Jupat taqe kunas taqe chuymaw utjäna.
He looked sad at me.	Jupajj nayar uñjasajj llakitaw uñnaqäna.
Eyelid short and long.	Nayra ch’iqa jisk’a ukat jach’a.

And one is very unhappy about it.	Ukat maynix uka tuqitxa wali jan kusisitaw jikxatasi.
Yeah, three of everything, too.	Jïsa, kimsa taqi kunat sipansa, ukhamaraki.
You think what you want.	Jumax kuntï munkta uk amuyta.
Let's see what he wants.	Kuntï jupajj munki uk uñjañäni.
But it’s worth it in the short term.	Ukampis mä juk’a pachanx wali askiwa.

This is known as cold sweat.	Ukax thaya ch’uqi sasin uñt’atawa.

He’s still going through it.	Jupax uka tuqitx wali ch’amampiw sarnaqaski.
Ultimately it doesn’t matter.	Qhipharux janiw ukax kunäkisa.

He knew exactly what time it was when he got there.	Ukar purisajj kuna horasas uk sum yatïna.

I have loved this game for years.	Walja maranakaw uka anattʼañ wal munta.

Well, he doesn’t, of course.	Ukhama, jupax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.

It just so happened that there was no reason.	Ukhamakiw pasäna, janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
But it turns out that this was not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti sasaw amuyasi.
I for one, am very very excited!!.	Nayax mä tuqitxa, wali wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa!!.
Of course, there would be no problem.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
I really want to do that.	Uk lurañ walpun munta.
And the snowflakes.	Ukat ch’uqi ch’uqi.
But he asked for it.	Ukampis jupajj uk mayïna.
He knew that wasn't the reason, ever.	Jupax janiw ukax kunatsa ukhamäkiti sasaw yatïna, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
It touched my whole heart.	Ukaw taqe chuyma chʼalljjtayasïna.
He needed better than that.	Jupajj ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumaw wakisïna.
Everything about it is fantastic.	Taqi kunas uka tuqitx wali muspharkañawa.
He’s the one who’s done it all.	Jupaw taqi ukanak lurawayi.
I want to get there.	Nayax ukaruw puriñ munta.
He got the job because nobody wanted him.	Jupajj janiw khitis munkänti, ukatwa uka trabajo katoqäna.
It’s pretty dark but it’s still there.	Ukax wali ch’amawa ukampis waliw utji.
I heard bad things about him.	Jupar jan walinak istʼta.
I know this doesn’t work.	Nayax yattwa akax janiw irnaqkiti.
And you look all tiny.	Ukat jumax taqpach jisk’a uñnaqaniwa.
His old self.	Jupan nayra pachpa.
I want to live well.	Nayax sum jakañ munta.
I know all this well enough.	Nayax taqi ukanak sum yatta.
All of them, at once.	Taqi jupanakax, mä kutikiw.
That’s what he was.	Ukax jupax ukhamänwa.
Three brothers.	Kimsa jila.
He had none himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw kunas utjkänti.
I repeat the question.	Uka jisktʼajj wasitatwa sista.
Glad to see that again.	Uk wasitat uñjasajj wal kusista.
I was sad, and sad.	Nayax llakitaw jikxatasiyäta, ukat llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
So let’s do that today.	Ukhamajj jichhürunakan ukham lurañäni.
Very very exciting though.	Wali wali kusiskañawa ukampis.
I expected nothing more from him.	Jupat janiw jukʼamp kuns suykayätti.
I want to know how that is.	Kunjamsa ukajj uk yatiñ munta.
Just don't do it the way you want it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunjamtï munkta ukhamarjam lurañamäkiti.
We have an hour.	Jiwasax mä horaw utjistu.
Is it necessary to do good.	¿Suma lurañax wakisispati.
There's a chance there.	Ukanx mä ch'amaw utji.
But he understood them.	Ukampis jupajj jupanakar sum amuyäna.
And he wanted to take it.	Ukat apsuñ munäna.
He was nice, quiet.	Jupax wali suma, amukiw jikxatasïna.
You're better than that.	Jumax ukat sipan juk'amp askiwa.
He said, yes, it is.	Jupax sänwa, jïsa, ukhamawa.
Available very quickly.	Wali jank’akiw utji.
A letter from him.	Jupat mä carta.
But it’s not a great way to do anyone’s eye.	Ukampis janiw khitirus nayra lurañatakix wali askïkiti.
It died quickly.	Ukajj jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
There was one thing to do.	Mä lurañaw utjäna.
It feels like you might want to talk to him.	Inas jupamp parltʼañ munsta sasaw amuyasi.
But it doesn't, and that would be nice.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj wali askïspawa.
But if anything happens to him, .	Ukampis kunas jupar pasaspa ukhajja, .
You know what happened.	Kunatï paskäna ukanakat jumajj yatisktawa.
This is what he wanted to do.	Ukajj jupajj lurañwa munäna.
He was so, very hungry.	Jupax ukhama, wali manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
I can't think for him.	Janiw jupatak amuytʼirjamäkti.
After that, it is almost nothing.	Uka qhepatjja, niyaw jan kunäkisa.
Small this time, but so, very important.	Jisk’a aka kutix, ukampis ukhama, wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s called the wind.	Ukax thaya satawa.
Let’s do the wrong thing.	Jan walinak lurañäni.
I can't think of a single one.	Janiw mä sapak amuytʼirjamäkti.
I’m all here.	Nayax taqiniw akanktxa.
Not much of one.	Janiw sinti mä.
Several times a week.	Semanan walja kuti.
Because this stupid guy.	Kunatix aka loqhe chachan.
I had no choice but to do it.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti, jan ukasti ukakiw utjäna.
I know what you mean early in the morning.	Nayax yattwa kuntix jumax wali alwat sañ munkta ukxa.
He left it completely and very happily.	Jupax taqpach ukat wali kusisitaw jaytawayi.
It’s really amazing, and it was delicious.	Chiqpachansa muspharkañawa, ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
I think he’s really cool.	Nayax amuyta jupax chiqpachapuniw wali suma jaqiwa.
That seemed kind of stupid.	Ukax mä juk’a llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
But he wasn't like that .	Ukampis jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti .
I like what he did.	Kuntï lurkäna ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
There are three downsides to this.	Uka tuqitxa kimsa jan waliw utji.
And then it wasn't the .	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw uka .
That’s weird, now.	Ukax muspharkañawa, jichhax.
But it’s not unbearable.	Ukampis janiw jan aguantañjamäkiti.
And that time.	Ukat uka tiempo.
I am about the truth.	Nayajj cheqäki uka toqetwa.
I don't know much about it.	Janiw uka toqet jukʼamp yatkti.
I feel bad about that.	Uka tuqitxa jan waliw jikxatastxa.
I want to do that for you.	Nayax jumatakix ukham lurañ munta.
He was watching the rain.	Jupajj jallu uñchʼukiskäna.
You seriously want this.	Jumax wali amuyumpiw akax munta.
He didn’t want to know, not really.	Jupax janiw yatiñ munkänti, janiw chiqpachansa.
He didn’t want to tell anyone about it.	Jupax janiw khitirus uka tuqit yatiyañ munkänti.
He looks really rough.	Jupax chiqpachansa qhuru uñnaqaniwa.
But really, it’s not very good.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, janiw sinti askïkiti.
But another thing was clear.	Ukampis yaqha tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasïna.
I don't quite understand that.	Nayajj janiw uk sum amuykti.
He said he knew nothing about the car.	Jupajj janiw uka autot kuns yatkti sasaw säna.
He was very real about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wali cheqpach jaqënwa.
Who wouldn't be in that situation.	Khitis jan ukham jan waltʼäwin uñjasispa.
There’s a lot worse out there.	Ukanx juk’amp jan waliw utji.
There is no better person.	Janiw juk’amp suma jaqix utjkiti.
But, it’s still fun.	Ukampis, wali kusiskañawa.
So he had no choice.	Ukhamajj janiw yaqha lurañajj jupan utjkänti.
He didn’t want to get into it.	Janiw ukar mantañ munkänti.
He wanted to do what was right.	Jupajj walpun kunatï cheqäki uk lurañ munäna.
Of course, this was not the case.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
Longer drives are more pleasant.	Jaya autot sarañajj jukʼamp sumawa.
I started all over again.	Nayax taqi kuns wasitat qalltawayta.
He went to bed.	Jupax ikiñar sarxäna.
It feels like the worst that can happen.	Ukajj jukʼamp jan walinak pasaspa ukhamwa amuyasi.
This is a good thing, not a bad thing.	Ukajj wali askiwa, janiw jan walïkiti.
And boy do we do something.	Ukat waynax jiwasax kuns lurañasa.
There is only one .	Ukax mä sapa .
I asked him what he should do.	Kunsa lurañapa sasaw jupar jisktʼta.
Now do more of it.	Jichhajj jukʼamp luram.
He really, really wanted her.	Jupax chiqpachansa, chiqpachapuniw juparux munäna.
It’s a little hard, but it’s a good one.	Mä juk’a ch’amawa, ukampis mä suma ch’amawa.
He lives in a small town.	Jupajj mä jiskʼa markanwa jakasi.
I really don't have much time.	Chiqansa janiw walja tiemponïkti.
But it needs to be done properly.	Ukampis sum lurañaw wakisi.
But people are amazing.	Ukampis jaqenakajj wali muspharkañawa.
But it was not available today.	Ukampis janiw jichha tiempon utjkänti.
That was just as interesting.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw wali sumapunïnwa.
Not that it's a bad thing.	Janiw ukajj jan walïkiti.
And you never know when it will happen.	Ukat kunapachas ukham pasani uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
Eventually, morning came.	Qhepatjja, alwajj walpun purinïna.
What needs to be done needs to be done.	Kunatix lurañax wakiski ukax lurañaw wakisi.
It’s rare he’ll do that.	Ukax juk’akiw jupax ukham lurani.
I feel like something is about to happen.	Kunas niyaw pasani sasaw amuyasta.
That's why it doesn't really work for me.	Ukatwa nayatakejj janiw cheqapuni askïkiti.
This is already known to happen.	Ukham lurañax nayratpach uñt’atawa.
These are the things I see every day.	Ukanakaw sapa uru uñjta.
It’s such a character.	Ukhama jaqiwa.
Well they might.	Suma jupanakax inas.
So that was today.	Ukhamajj jichhürunakan ukhamänwa.
But I understood that.	Ukampis nayajj uk sum amuyayäta.
He came to talk to me last night.	Jupax qhipa arumaw nayamp parlir jutäna.
Someone told me.	Mayniw sitäna.
It’s still time.	Ukax wali pachaw purini.
Maybe he would never do that now.	Inas jichhajj janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.
I always say that, too.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham sañ munta, ukhamaraki.
Lots of this and lots of that.	Walja aka ukat walja ukat.
But if it happens, it will.	Ukampis pasaspa ukhajja, ukhamarakiw pasaspa.
It looks great here.	Aka chiqanx wali suma uñtatawa.
But it will take time.	Ukampis tiempow munasini.
He is a tall man .	Jupajj jachʼa jaqewa .
He was alone when it happened.	Ukajj paskäna ukhajja, sapakiw jikjjatasïna.
Doesn't mean it's wrong.	Janiw ukajj jan walïkiti sañ munkiti.
There's this however.	Ukanx aka ukampis.
He felt all that way.	Jupajj taqeniw ukham jikjjatasïna.
But the direction is clear.	Ukampis kawkirus sarañapa ukajj qhanawa.
It happened that night.	Uka arumaw ukham pasäna.
He was a tiny little man.	Jupajj mä jiskʼa jiskʼa jaqënwa.
That’s not saying much, really.	Ukax janiw sinti sañ munkiti, chiqpachansa.
He told me the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw nayarojj sitäna.
But it wasn't then or there.	Ukampis janiw uka tiempon ni uka cheqan utjkänti.
After that, no .	Uka qhepatjja, janiw .
But he didn't understand that.	Ukampis jupajj uk janiw amuykänti.
So far, good, though .	Jichhakamax, wali sumawa, ukampis .
But another week .	Ukampis yaqha semanaw .
He had done that to her.	Jupajj jupar ukham luratayna.
I understand it’s hard for you.	Nayax amuyasta jumatakix ch’amawa.
This happened to me several times.	Ukajj walja kutiw nayar pasäna.
That doesn't make much sense to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw sinti askïkiti.
That’s why everything is everywhere.	Ukatwa taqi kunas taqi chiqan utji.
I don’t want coffee.	Nayax janiw café munkti.
They had more than enough.	Jupanakajj jukʼampiw utjäna.
I just feel sleepy.	Nayax ukhamakiw ikiñan jikxatastxa.
Please tell me why.	Kunatsa ukham luraski uk yatiyapxita.
It almost sucked.	Ukax niyaw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
A very kind heart.	Mä wali suma chuyma.
Never mind, he told himself.	Janipuniw kunäkisa, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
You can have both at the same time.	Panpachaniw mä pachpa tiempon utjaspa.
I’m the same.	Nayax pachpa.
So maybe you should do some.	Ukhamajj inas mä qhawqha lurañama.
He left about a week ago.	Jupajj niya mä semana nayraw sarjjäna.
I don’t know what to do here.	Janiw kuns akan lurañ yatkti.
Today was a bad night.	Jichhürojj jan wali arumaw utjäna.
Himself, but completely blank.	Jupa pachpa, ukampis taqpach ch’uqi.
I had no idea what had happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasäna uk janiw amuykayätti.
You don't have to do all of that.	Janiw taqe ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn't realize it himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw amuyaskänti.
I think maybe he does.	Inas jupax ukham luraspa sasaw amuyta.
You know it and always have.	Jumax uk yatisktawa ukat sapa kutiw ukham yatta.
He saw that she was looking.	Jupajj uñchʼukiskäna uk uñjäna.
I really don’t know about that.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka tuqit yatkti.
Yes, he did it.	Jïsa, jupaw uk luräna.
He’s in a lot of pain right now.	Jupax jichhax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
Maybe once or twice.	Inas mä kuti jan ukax pä kuti.
You know there is no such thing.	Jumax yatisktawa janiw ukham kunas utjkiti.
He threw it away.	Jupajj ukanak jaqontäna.
Where are you from?.	¿Kawkitsa jumax jikxatastaxa?.
Now he enjoys doing it part-time.	Jichhax jupax chika uru lurañax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
That time is upon us again.	Uka tiempojj wasitatwa jiwasatak purini.
It was very very early.	Wali wali alwaw utjäna.

This world is beautiful.	Aka pachax wali sumaw uñjasi.
There is nothing .	Janiw kunas utjkiti .
Three great days.	Kimsa jach’a uru.
But you are not like that.	Ukampis janiw jumanakajj ukhamäkiti.
I just can’t do it.	Nayax janiw lurañjamäkiti.
Best of all, it doesn’t cost anything.	Taqi kunat sipansa, janiw kuna qullqis munaskiti.
And it took longer before that.	Ukat uka nayrajj jukʼamp tiempow pasäna.
He didn't know how to use one.	Jupajj janiw kunjamsa mä apnaqañ yatkänti.
There is no school.	Janiw yatiqañ utax utjkiti.
No one knows exactly why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
I wasn't surprised.	Uk uñjasajj janiw muspharkayätti.
It seems almost impossible.	Niya jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamawa.
You don’t have to go to school.	Janiw escuelar sarañax wakiskiti.
No one can do anything about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw khitis kuns lurkaspati.
No party time yet.	Janiw fiesta tiempox utjkiti.
And this little cold.	Ukat aka jisk’a thaya.
It would be good to go now.	Jichhax sarañax wali askïspawa.
A great Christmas gift.	Mä jach’a navidad regalo.
Hope to see you there soon.	Ukan jankʼak uñjañ suytʼaskta.
But he said it was fine.	Ukampis jupajj walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
This one wasn’t like that.	Aka maynix janiw ukhamäkänti.
It doesn’t do anything.	Janiw ukax kuns lurkiti.
You are welcome!.	Janiw kunatsa!.
He saw the real man in him again.	Jupan utjki uka cheqpach chacharuw wasitat uñjäna.
The most important thing to do is not to do anything else.	Uka lurañax wali wakiskiriwa, janiw yaqha lurañanak lurañax wakiskiti.
And he made the mess.	Ukat jupaw uka jan waltʼäw luräna.
It was obviously reluctant.	Ukajj janiw munkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Nothing like this had ever happened before.	Janiw ukham kunas nayrajj utjkänti.
I’m sure he’ll be fine.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali sumaw jikxatasi.
He was hungry for everything.	Jupax taqi kunat manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
I couldn't do anything after that.	Uka qhepatjja janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
It’s time for something new.	Kuna machaq lurañanak lurañ pachaw purini.
An extremely long time.	Mä sinti jaya tiempo.
Junt’s red blood.	Junt’u wila wila.
No one really spoke to me.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapunix nayar arskänti.
He doesn't know that.	Jupajj janiw ukham yatkiti.
He did everything right.	Jupajj taqe kunsa sumwa luräna.
He’s the only one who knows.	Jupa sapakiw yati.

Now he said this.	Jichhajj akham sänwa.
How he lived his life.	Kunjamsa jupajj jakasïna.
Sorry, never mind.	Perdón, janipuniw kunäkisa.
He was always here.	Jupajj sapa kutiw aka cheqan utjäna.
Or, he asked.	Jan ukajj sasaw jisktʼäna.
It's funny, but .	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa, ukampis .

He has a place.	Jupax mä chiqaw utji.
Today, there was not a big one.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw mä jachʼa jaqejj utjkänti.
John loves coffee.	Juanajj café wal gusti.
That one day lasted a couple of hours.	Uka mä urux mä pä horaw pasäna.
You are the best person for me.	Jumax nayatakix wali suma jaqïtawa.
He saw exactly how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk sum uñjäna.
He told me the same thing.	Jupajj ukhamarakiw nayar yatiyäna.
He has already done a lot.	Jupajj nayratpachaw walja lurañanak lurawayi.
He decided to do it.	Jupaw uk lurañ amtäna.
What does this mean.	Kunas akax sañ muni.
So why do they like it so much?.	Ukhamajj ¿kunatsa jupanakar wal gusti?.
Things are moving fast.	Kunanakas wali chʼamampiw saraski.
But they have a .	Ukampis jupanakax mä .
Of course, on the one hand .	Chiqansa, mä tuqitxa .
He had a thing with her about two years ago.	Jupajj niya pä maraw jupamp mä kuns utjäna.
But when he did, .	Ukampis ukham luräna ukhajja, .
He doesn't want to know.	Jupajj janiw yatiñ munkiti.
For me, it’s more.	Nayatakix juk’ampi.
That was all he had.	Ukakiw jupajj utjäna.
It really matters quite a bit.	Chiqpachansa mä jukʼa wakiskiriwa.
We’ll see them tomorrow.	Qharüruw jupanakar uñjañäni.

Because that new, hot person is that new, hot person.	Kunatix uka machaq, junt’u jaqix uka machaq, junt’u jaqiwa.
This past year has been a great one.	Aka qhipa marax mä jach’a maraw utjawayi.
Nothing he understood better.	Janiw kunas jupajj jukʼamp sum amuykänti.
And it happened for a while.	Ukat mä tiempow ukham pasäna.
But you get your point.	Ukampis jumajj kuntï siskta uk sum amuyta.
A real gift, indeed.	Chiqpach regalo, chiqpachansa.
That alone is impressive.	Uka sapakix wali muspharkañawa.
No, it really was.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa ukhamänwa.
Beer is good enough.	Cerveza ukax wali askiwa.
The here and now.	Uka akan ukat jichhax.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyta.
I feel like you have to tell him that's not the case.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw jupar yatiyañama sasaw amuyasta.
He was looking in a certain direction.	Jupajj mä jukʼa toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
It’s really home now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax utaparuw puri.
That means he is fine .	Ukajj jupajj walikïskiwa sañ muni .
He sat here himself.	Jupa pachpaw akan qontʼasïna.

There’s something about him.	Jupat mä kunaw utji.
You never knew about anything.	Jumax janipuniw kuna tuqitsa yatkayätati.

And he arrived.	Ukat jupajj purinïna.

That’s what we need.	Ukaw jiwasatak wakisini.

He can't really do anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns lurkaspati.
Two short years ago.	Pä jisk’a mara nayra.
The man knew it.	Chachax uk yatïna.
But, he’s awesome.	Ukampis, jupax wali muspharkañawa.
He slammed the door hard.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw punku ch’allxtayäna.
You know he really wants to go.	Jumax yatisktawa jupax chiqpachapuniw sarañ muni.
Of course, the money is good.	Chiqansa, qullqix wali askiwa.
I doubt it, he thought.	Nayax pächastwa, sasaw jupax amuyäna.
I have one every other day.	Nayax sapa pä uruw maynix utjitu.
He still feels that way, at least.	Jupax wali ukham jikxatasi, mä juk’a.
Time really goes by so fast.	Chiqpachansa tiempox wali jankʼakiw saraski.
What it was, he didn't quite know.	Kunas ukajja, janiw sum yatkänti.
He didn't know why he said that again.	Kunatsa wasitat ukham säna uk janiw yatkänti.
You have to do this very carefully.	Ukajj wali sumwa lurañama.
And he knew what was going to happen.	Ukat kunas pasani uk sum yatïna.
He asked me to go with him.	Jupamp sarañatakiw mayïtu.
Just once, and he got there.	Mä kutikiw, ukat jupax ukaruw purinïna.
Well, this is pretty cool.	Ukhama, akax wali sumawa.
That was the great university.	Ukaw jach’a jach’a yatiqañ utax utjäna.
And frankly, that’s not good enough.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukax janiw askïkiti.

He knew these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sum yatïna.
It didn't matter to me at the time.	Nayatakejj uka tiemponjja janiw ukajj kunäkisa.
He doesn’t want to see me.	Janiw nayar uñjañ munkiti.
But there are no locations.	Ukampis janiw kawkhantï utjki ukanakajj utjkiti.
The point is, he wants to get out first.	Uka tuqitxa, jupax nayraqat mistuñ muni.
He never said anything before, never after.	Janipuniw nayrajj kuns siskänti, qhepatjja janipuniw kuns siskänti.

Something was real.	Kunas cheqpachapun utjäna.

Don’t do your homework.	Janiw tareanak lurañamäkiti.
And he would do it again.	Ukat jupajj wasitatwa ukham luraspäna.
It’s pretty obvious, after all.	Wali qhanawa, taqi kunat sipansa.
I will do better tomorrow.	Nayajj qharürojj jukʼamp sumwa lurä.
There’s nothing special about it.	Ukanx janiw kunas wali askïkiti.
Let us do as well as he did to you.	Kunjamtï jumar lurkäna uk sum lurañäni.
He felt very old.	Jupajj wali chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
No one is going to talk to you.	Janiw khitis jumamp parlir sarkiti.
I personally thought it was a good idea.	Naya pachpaw ukajj wali askïkaspas ukham amuyayäta.
He didn't like that.	Ukajj janiw jupar gustkänti.
There are so many things for you.	Walja kunaw jumatakix utji.
That is the problem.	Ukaw jan waltʼäwin uñjasi.
You’re slow, slow.	Jumax juk’ampi juk’ampi, juk’ampi juk’ampi.

I want him here with me.	Nayax juparux nayamp chikaw akan munta.
I want you to take better care of me tonight.	Jichha arumax nayar jukʼamp sum uñjañ munta.
I think it was pretty quick.	Nayax wali jank’akiw ukham luratayna sasaw amuyta.
But not in the way you think.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhama.
He talked about something else.	Jupajj yaqha toqet parläna.
I would need help.	Nayajj yanaptʼa munasispa.
He got a bit of it.	Jupajj mä jukʼa katoqäna.
I hope that happens.	Ukham lurasiñap suyt’askta.
Everything seemed to work out on this day.	Taqi kunas aka urux wali askïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
He said nothing about it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak toqet kuns siskänti.
Or stick to it.	Jan ukajj ukaruw chʼamachasiñama.
It doesn’t matter, there’s no reason to.	Janiw ukax wakiskiti, janiw kuna razonas ukax wakiskiti.
And beyond that, he was happy.	Ukat ukat sipansa, jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
I mean as little as possible.	Nayax jisk’a jisk’a sañ munta.
But I doubt I know how to do it.	Ukampis nayax pächastwa, nayax uk lurañ yatta.
I think you know what they are.	Nayax amuyta, jumax yatisktawa kunas jupanakax ukxa.
He rolled his eyes at me.	Jupax nayaruw nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.

So true and so flat.	Ukham chiqa ukat ukham ch’uqi.

He thanked her for that.	Ukatwa jupajj yuspärta.

Somewhere there is someone.	Kawkhansa mayniw utji.
I came a little late.	Nayax mä juk’a pacharuw jutta.
But not for one reason or another.	Ukampis janiw mä kunatsa ukham lurañjamäkiti.

They are a lot of fun.	Jupanakajj wali kusiskañawa.
He’d do everything right in the morning.	Jupax alwax taqi kuns sum luraspäna.
No one told him, he did it himself.	Janiw khitis juparux siskänti, jupa pachpaw uk luräna.
Who knows everything.	Khitis taqi kun yati.
It was almost like that for me.	Niya nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
It’s been a long time.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw pasäna.
Whatever we do, that’s it.	Kuns lurañäni, ukax ukhamawa.
But somehow .	Ukampis kunjamatsa .
I am very happy about these.	Ukanakat walpun kusista.
There’s no more time.	Janiw juk’ampi pachax utjkiti.
And he decided to see it for himself.	Ukat jupa pachpaw uk uñjañ amtäna.
So there is no such question.	Ukhamajj janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkiti.
I don’t know but still.	Janiw yatkti ukampis wali.
But here he is alone.	Ukampis akanx sapakiw jikxatasi.
It’s a great film.	Mä jach’a película.
Every day is a good day.	Sapa uru mä suma uru.
But now it is beautiful.	Ukampis jichhajj wali sumawa.
Let’s do what we can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañäni.
There is no reason to rush.	Janiw kunatsa jankʼak lurañajj utjkiti.
Amazingly beautiful and comfortable.	Muspharkañ suma ukat suma.
I’ve been with him before.	Nayax nayrax jupamp chikaw sarawayta.
But it can pass quickly.	Ukampis jankʼakiw pasaspa.
But he didn't want to move.	Ukampis janiw yaqha chiqar sarxañ munkänti.
But he’s a real person.	Ukampis jupax chiqpach jaqiwa.
But everyone knows something.	Ukampis taqiniw mä jukʼa yatipxi.
He’s afraid of something.	Jupax kunatsa axsarayi.
You are rich in yourself.	Juma pachpaw qamir jaqïtawa.
It’s the same person.	Ukax pachpa jaqiwa.
I don’t know a whole lot about him.	Janiw jupat taqpach yatkti.
So it’s incredible.	Ukhamajj janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Make a happy word right.	Mä kusisit arunak chiqapar lurañamawa.
We don’t need to do that.	Jiwasax janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He stayed in bed for a long time.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow ikiñan qheparäna.
And then one day it wasn’t.	Ukat ukat mä urux janiw ukhamäkänti.
Of course no one knows about it yet.	Chiqansa janiw khitis uka tuqit jichhakamax yatkiti.
He decided to go there.	Jupaw uka cheqar sarañ amtäna.
I can't think about it anymore tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw uka tuqit jukʼamp amuytʼirjamäkti.
You look like that.	Jumax ukham uñnaqaniwa.
It will come by itself .	Ukajj jupa pachpaw jutani .
It feels like the time is right for this book.	Aka libro lurañatakix tiempox walikïskiwa sasaw amuyasi.
Where was the question.	Kawkinsa uka jisktʼajj utjäna.
He doesn’t go to the party.	Jupax janiw fiestar sarkiti.
As he had done so many times.	Kunjamtï walja kutix lurkäna ukhama.
He would do anything for you.	Jupajj jumatakejj kunsa luraspäna.
He is the one who exists.	Jupaw jupajj utji.
I started that night.	Uka arumaw qalltawayta.
I asked, and waited.	Nayax jiskt’asta, ukat suyt’ta.
A cold winter night is perfect.	Mä thaya juyphi arumax wali askiwa.
It does everything wrong.	Ukajj taqe kunaw jan walinak luri.
He gave himself a shake.	Jupa pachpaw mä chʼalljjtayasïna.
John is well aware of this.	Juanajj uk sum yati.
It seems like the money is worth it.	Ukax qullqix wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
I had a great time this evening.	Jichha jayp’ux wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He never wanted to tell you.	Jupajj janipuniw jumar yatiyañ munkänti.
But there’s something surprising.	Ukampis mä kunaw muspharkañ utji.
That is something no one else can do.	Ukajj janiw khitis lurkaspati.
Of course there was nothing there.	Chiqansa janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
No one knows anything about him.	Janiw khitis jupat kuns yatkiti.
Something about this.	Kunas aka tuqitxa.
But no one did anything like that.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukham kuns lurkänti.
But I don’t know where he lives.	Ukampis janiw kawkhans jakasi uk yatkti.
Not a penny more.	Janiw mä qullqis juk’ampi.
I felt an immediate sense of excitement.	Mä jankʼakiw kusisit jikjjatasta.
He stared at the phone for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow telefonot uñchʼukiskäna.
Well, it actually happened.	Ukhamawa, chiqpachansa ukham pasäna.
There’s nothing nice about it.	Janiw kuna suma lurañas utjkiti.
I prefer that drink.	Nayax uka umañ juk’amp munta.
That doesn't matter .	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa .
He usually eats early in the morning.	Jupajj wali alwat manqʼañ yati.
That’s good, but it’s not good enough.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukampis janiw askïkiti.
And never had any problems before.	Ukat janipuniw nayrajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
I really want to talk about it.	Uka toqet parltʼañ wal munta.
Two bedrooms.	Pä ikiñ uta.
In that case, it was.	Uka tuqitxa, ukhamänwa.
They are beautiful.	Jupanakax wali sumawa.
I want to know when we are.	Kunapachas jiwasax uk yatiñ munta.
Or it doesn’t.	Jan ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he knew there was nothing he could do.	Ukampis janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati uk sum yatïna.
She is a sincere, beautiful woman.	Jupax taqi chuyma, suma warmiwa.
I know better myself.	Naya pachpaw jukʼamp sum yatta.
So he didn't say anything more for a while.	Ukatwa jupajj mä qhawqha tiempojj jan jukʼamp arskänti.
But that's how he felt.	Ukampis ukhamwa jupajj jikjjatasïna.
And that was some time ago.	Ukat ukajj mä qhawqha tiempo nayraw pasäna.
I didn't want to do that right now.	Janiw jichhajj ukham lurañ munkayätti.
The question was what.	Uka jisktʼajj kunsa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He gave it all every day.	Jupajj sapa uruw taqe ukanak churäna.
He never had any kind of problem.	Jupajj janipuniw kuna kasta jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
He said it was a bad joke.	Jupax jan wali chiqaw sasaw säna.
He hoped for another opportunity.	Jupajj yaqha oportunidad utjani sasaw suyäna.
I don’t need to go there again.	Janiw mayamps ukar sarañax wakiskiti.
It’s been two weeks now.	Ukax pä semanaw jichhax utji.
Let’s do it anywhere.	Kawkhansa lurañäni.
He really knows how to really do something.	Chiqpachansa jupax chiqpachapuniw mä kun lurañ yati.
He stayed there for quite some time and had a wonderful stay.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow ukan qheparäna, wali sumwa qheparäna.
Nothing works well.	Janiw kunas sum irnaqkiti.
And he wanted more than that.	Ukat ukat sipansa jukʼampiw jupajj munäna.
He doesn’t want it now.	Janiw jichhax munkiti.
This man is awesome.	Aka jaqix wali muspharkañawa.
But so far it has worked.	Ukampis jichhakamajj walikïskiwa.
How does it feel?.	¿Kunjamsa jikjjatasi?.
You have to work on it all the time.	Uka tuqitxa sapa kutiw chʼamachasiñama.
I decided to take a taxi.	Nayax mä taxi ukar sarañ amtawayta.
So, it’s obvious to me.	Ukhama, nayatakix qhanaw amuyasi.
I’m going to do my best to learn.	Nayax taqi ch’amampiw yatxatañ munta.
We will do the same here.	Jiwasajj ukhamarakiw aka cheqan lurañäni.
And it seemed impossible.	Ukat jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s someone who can do the job.	Ukax khititix uka irnaqäw lurañ yati ukawa.
No, it doesn’t work that way.	Janiwa, janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
So he knew it, after all.	Ukhamajj jupajj uk sum yatïna, taqe kunat sipansa.
I didn’t want to leave it at that.	Janiw nayax ukham jaytañ munkayätti.
That he’s getting better.	Ukax jupax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He doesn’t seem to know anything really.	Jupax janiw kuns chiqpachapuni yatkaspa ukhama.
He had been there so well before.	Jupajj nayrajj ukham wali sumwa ukan sarnaqäna.
I know why and how.	Kunatsa ukat kunjamsa uk sum yatta.
The New Year is coming soon.	Machaq marax niyaw purini.
He took three questions.	Jupajj kimsa jisktʼanak apsüna.
There really is nothing like it.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunas ukham utjkiti.
How many times have I asked.	Qhawqha kutis jisktʼasta.
I can't have it without it.	Nayajj janiw jan ukajj utjkaspati.
I don't really believe him.	Nayajj janiw cheqpachapun jupar creykti.
There will be a better time for it.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp suma pachaw utjani.
He doesn’t really want much about it.	Jupax janiw chiqpachans uka tuqit sinti munkiti.
That’s what he wants.	Ukaw jupajj muni.
But he spoke very well immediately.	Ukampis jankʼakiw wali sum parläna.
I thought he was a good guy.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
So far today I liked something.	Jichhakamax jichhürunakanx kunas nayatakix wali askiwa.
But is the man .	Ukampis ¿uka jaqejj .
It is important to avoid this.	Uka jan lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
It’s funny and beautiful.	Wali muspharkañawa ukat wali sumawa.
Yes, you should never do that.	Jïsa, janipuniw ukanak lurañamäkiti.
Let’s see what happens this time.	Aka kutin kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
You don’t need every one.	Janiw sapa maynix munaskiti.
But it’s difficult here.	Ukampis akanx ch’amawa.
I don’t really want to do that again.	Janiw chiqpachansa wasitat ukham lurañ munkti.
But it is difficult to do here.	Ukampis akan lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
Tell me how to do this in the real world.	Chiqpach pachanx kunjams uk lurañax uk yatiyapxita.
I don’t want him alone.	Janiw jupa sapak munkti.
It doesn’t matter .	Janiw kunas wakiskiti .
But this doesn’t really work.	Ukampis akax janiw chiqpachansa irnaqkiti.
Nothing works well in the morning room.	Janiw kunas alwax cuarto ukanx sum irnaqkiti.
But the reality is much more exciting.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj jukʼamp kusiskañawa.
Please tell us what we can do better.	Kunanaktï jukʼamp sum lurañjamäki uk yatiyapjjeta.
It’s really not worth the money.	Chiqpachansa janiw uka qullqix wakiskiti.
I don’t quite get that.	Janiw nayax uk sum jikxatkti.
It’s that much more fun.	Ukax ukham juk’amp kusiskañawa.
It gave me a chance.	Ukaw mä chʼam churitu.

I decided this myself.	Naya pachpaw uk amtawayta.
He loved her with all his heart.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw munasïna.

Where did the man go? 	¿Kawkirus uka jaqejj saräna?

But he hasn’t done anything yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax kuns lurkiti.
He didn't want to ask the question.	Jupajj janiw uka jisktʼajj lurañ munkänti.
You need someone like that.	Jumax ukham jaqiruw munasma.
But now it feels good.	Ukampis jichhax wali sumaw jikxatasi.

Everything about it is fine.	Taqi kunas uka tuqitxa walikïskiwa.

This will require more violence.	Ukatakejj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisini.
Or maybe not at all.	Jan ukajj inas jan ukham lurañajj wakischispa.
Now let’s see what happens.	Jichhax kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
You don't need anyone to do it.	Uk lurañatakejj janiw khitis munaskiti.
I don’t want to give more here.	Nayax janiw juk’amp akan churañ munkti.
We’re pretty clear on that.	Jiwasax wali qhanaw uka tuqitxa.
Still a lot of snow though.	Wali walja ch’uqi ukampis.

There was a time.	Kuna pachas utjäna.
If you want to come, let me know.	Jumatix jutañ munsta ukhax yatiyapxita.
I see it from two sides.	Nayax pä tuqit uñjta.
He thought he could do better.	Jupajj jukʼamp sumwa luraspa sasaw amuyäna.
So do this one more thing for me, he said.	Ukhamajj nayatakejj aka mä jukʼamp luram, sasaw säna.
He is fluent in many languages.	Jupajj walja arunak sum parlañ yati.
He loved it, of course.	Jupax walpun munäna, chiqpachansa.
I didn’t understand a thing.	Janiw mä kuns amuykayätti.

There was everything to eat.	Ukanjja, manqʼañatakejj taqe kunaw utjäna.
I want to mention this other thing.	Aka yaqha tuqit arsuñ munta.
I could have done it a long time ago.	Nayajj nayratpachaw uk luraspäna.
This is the learning curve.	Akax yatiqañ utar uñtatawa.
Everyone knows that, of course.	Taqinipuniw uk yatipxi, chiqpachansa.
I decided otherwise.	Nayax yaqha tuqit amtawayta.
And he would do the same.	Ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw luraspäna.
But obviously it's a valid question.	Ukampis qhanaw uka jisktʼajj walikïskiwa.
But as it happens .	Ukampis kunjamtï luraski ukhama .
There was nothing more to it than that.	Ukat sipansa janiw kunas jukʼamp utjkänti.
I don’t want to comment on this.	Nayax janiw aka tuqitx arsuñ munkti.
He did that for you.	Jupaw jumatak ukham luräna.
He loves her too.	Jupajj jupar wal munaraki.
I went to his house last night.	Nayax qhipa arumax utaparuw sarawayta.
That means wholeheartedly.	Ukax taqi chuymaw sañ muni.
You know, there’s nothing you can do about it.	Jumax yatisktawa, uka tuqitx janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Not that he didn't do anything.	Janiw jupajj jan kuns lurkänti.
I remember it a lot.	Nayax walpun amtasta.
He had no idea how long it had been.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasäna uk janiw amuykänti.

That’s not much you can do.	Ukax janiw sinti lurañjamäkiti.
There, it was.	Ukanjja, ukhamänwa.
He knew he didn't like that.	Jupajj janiw ukham gustkänti uk sum yatïna.
But there was one thing he knew.	Ukampis mä toqetwa jupajj sum yatïna.
In fact, he worked there for nearly a decade.	Chiqansa, niya tunka maranakaw ukan irnaqäna.
You know what a night feels like.	Mä arumax kunjamsa jikxatasi uk jumax yatisktawa.
I feel like a fool .	Nayajj mä loqhe jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta .
I just said that.	Nayax jichhakiw ukham sista.
That’s the first thing he sees.	Ukaw nayrïr kutix uñji.

It meant smaller.	Ukax jisk’a sañ munäna.
That was the first time he saw her.	Uka nayrïr kutiw jupar uñjäna.
Because who knows what’s inside.	Kunatix khitis yati kunatix manqhan utjki ukax.
Today, it will rain again.	Jichhürunakanxa, wasitat jallu purini.
It’s always the same.	Sapa kutiw ukhama.
In fact, it’s surprising.	Chiqansa, ukax muspharkañawa.
He didn't have much time.	Jupajj janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.

It feels great and looks great to me.	Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi ukat nayatakix wali sumaw uñtasi.

I’m okay with all of that.	Nayax taqi ukanak lurañax walikïskiwa.
No, he can do that.	Janiwa, jupajj ukham luraspawa.
He didn't know where it was.	Jupajj kawkhansa ukajj uk janiw yatkänti.
And how he walked.	Ukat kunjamsa sarnaqäna.
Don’t do it yourself.	Janiw juma pachpa luramti.

Maybe later on.	Inas qhepatjja.
But it was a long time for me.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali jaya tiempow pasäna.
That’s what he says all the time.	Ukax sapa kutiw ukham arsu.

But there will be something else to do.	Ukampis yaqha lurañaw utjani.

Or he was very happy.	Jan ukajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He will come with you.	Jupajj jumamp chikaw jutani.

But not this, of course.	Ukampis janiw akax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.

I didn’t find anything there.	Janiw kunas ukan jikxatkti.
Of course, that means the opposite.	Chiqansa, ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sañ muni.
I can't have it.	Janiw nayajj utjkaspati.
I don’t know what happens after that.	Uka qhepat kunas pasani uk janiw yatkti.

But then he saw it.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jupajj uk uñjäna.
He looked very pleased with himself.	Jupax jupa pachpat wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
He didn't want to give up who he was.	Jupajj janiw khitïnsa uk jaytañ munkänti.
You know what happened last night.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas qhipa arumax pasäna.
He really loved it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw munasïna.
I didn’t have to go anywhere.	Janiw mä chiqar sarañax wakiskänti.

He couldn’t drive anywhere now.	Jichhax janiw kawkirus auto apnaqañ puedkänti.
You’re the only one who can do that.	Juma sapakiw ukham lurasma.
He knew where he was coming from.	Jupajj kawkitsa jutani uk sum yatïna.

I’m looking after the house.	Nayax uta uñjta.
Of course, now.	Chiqansa, jichhax.
But nothing is good enough.	Ukampis janiw kunas askïkiti.
And there’s no way to prove it.	Ukat janiw kunas ukax chiqaw sañjamäkiti.

There is no one there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkiti.
It feels like a long time to me.	Nayatakix wali jaya tiempow ukham amuyasi.
At the time, he felt helpless.	Uka tiemponjja, jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
He meant something.	Jupajj kunsa sañ munäna.
But really, it was something.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, kunas ukhamänwa.
He accepted the job.	Jupajj uka trabajo iyaw sänwa.
We all went there.	Taqeniw ukaruw sarapjjta.

It’s also not about that.	Ukhamaraki janiwa uka tuqitxa.
But so far it’s not bad.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw jan walïkiti.
Old and new.	Nayra ukat machaq.
Now let’s get these straight.	Jichhax ukanak chiqapar uñjañäni.
He was doing something else.	Jupajj yaqha toqetwa luraskäna.
I have known this for a long time now.	Jichhajj walja tiempow uk yatta.
And no one noticed.	Ukat janiw khitis amuyaskänti.
What that meant.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munkäna.
I think it really was.	Chiqpachansa ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
I hope to see them here.	Jupanakar aka chiqan uñjañ suyt’askta.
Rather, the question is more obvious.	Jan ukasti, uka jisktʼajj jukʼamp qhanawa.
And another week.	Ukat yaqha semana.
Twenty types of potatoes.	Pä tunka kasta ch’uqi.
Himself or himself.	Jupa pachpa jan ukax jupa pachpa.
He knew that, yes.	Jupajj uk sum yatïna, jïsa.
That one would be good for that.	Uka maynix ukatakix wali askïspawa.
I think they’re important.	Nayax jupanakax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
And tell me the worst.	Ukat jukʼamp jan walinak yatiyapjjeta.
A good one, but so much more than that.	Mä suma, ukampis ukat sipansa juk’ampi.
Of course, immediately and .	Chiqansa, jankʼakiw ukat .
There’s always something.	Sapa kutiw kunas utji.
I saw him there.	Ukan jupar uñjta.
He just repeated the same thing at home.	Jupajj jichhakiw utapan pachpa arunak wasitat arsüna.
You know there was something.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas utjäna.
He moves into his new home.	Jupax machaq utaparuw sarxi.
It’s never everything one wants.	Janipuniw taqi kunas maynix munkiti.
He already knew it.	Jupajj niyaw uk yatïna.
Very bad, too.	Wali jan wali, ukhamaraki.
I just wanted to come out and speak up.	Nayax ukhamakiw mistuñ munta ukat arsuñ munta.
I’m not sure how good this is.	Nayax janiw kunjams akax askïspa ukx yatkti.
He came here this morning.	Jupax jichhür alwaw akan jutäna.
It terrified him more than anything else.	Ukajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼampiw jupar wal ajjsaräna.
Very comfortable and delicious.	Wali suma ukat wali suma.
I saw almost everything you could imagine.	Niya taqe kuntï jumajj amuykayäta ukanak uñjta.
I don't say anything to myself.	Janiw naya pachpajj kuns siskti.
But I think you know that.	Ukampis jumax uk yatisktawa sasaw amuyta.
I know there is something but nothing.	Nayax yattwa kunas utji ukampis janiw kunas utjkiti.
So much so that it wasn't like him.	Ukhamajj jupat sipansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
I’m sure he’s going to do great.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali jach’a lurañapawa.
But no one knew when that would happen.	Ukampis kunapachas ukham pasani uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
What you don't know.	Kuntï jan yatkta ukajja.
It’s really impossible.	Chiqpachansa janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He was afraid to do so.	Jupajj ukham lurañwa ajjsaräna.
So it was pretty much now or never.	Ukhamajj niyaw jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
That person was always there.	Uka jaqejj sapa kutiw utjäna.
I want familiar things.	Nayax uñt’at yänak munta.
And he was obviously afraid.	Ukat qhanaw ajjsaräna.
Don't let him do that.	Janiw ukham lurañapatak jaytañamäkiti.
This may take a day or two.	Ukatakejj mä uru jan ukajj pä uruw munasispa.
And he said it was a book.	Ukat mä libro sänwa.
This, and this, but not this.	Aka, ukat aka, ukampis janiw aka.
But he wasn't about to admit it.	Ukampis janiw niyaw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
But someone knows that.	Ukampis mayniw uk yati.
And it went on for years.	Ukat walja maranakaw ukham sarnaqäna.
The cold, snowy air.	Uka thaya, ch’uqi thaya.
Not like that was the case.	Janiw kunjamtï ukajj utjkänti.
We have these things.	Jiwasax ukanak utjistu.
I immediately fell in love with her.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupar munasta.
It’s slow, long.	Ukax llamp’u, jaya.
He knows all about it.	Jupaw taqe ukanak yati.
There was nothing to do.	Janiw kunas lurañax utjkänti.
Of course he thought so.	Chiqansa jupax ukham amuyäna.
I know my own limitations.	Naya pachpaw kunanaktï jan lurañjamäki uk yattwa.
And he was very happy.	Ukat jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
But there may be time for that later.	Ukampis ukatakejj qhepatwa tiempojj utjaspa.
Do this as you do.	Ukham lurañamawa kunjamtï lurapkta ukhama.
A coin, yes.	Mä qullqi, jïsa.
He desperately needed some money.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qollqe wal munäna.
No one did it better.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp sum lurkänti.
That’s all we have to do.	Ukakiw lurañasa.
But I have both.	Ukampis nayajj panpachaniw utjitu.

To my surprise, he gave me three.	Nayatakix wali muspharkañawa kimsa churitu.
But the time for that came too late.	Ukampis ukatakejj qhepatwa tiempojj utjäna.
And it has a charter.	Ukat ukax mä carta ukaniwa.
You know that's that's that's what's good.	Jumax yatisktawa uka ukax ukax ukax kuna suma.
That, after all, is good.	Ukax, taqi kunat sipansa, wali askiwa.
And it's better, too.	Ukat jukʼamp askiwa, ukhamaraki.
I could have done better than anything else.	Nayajj taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa luraspäna.
It came the other day.	Ukajj yaqha uruw purinïna.
I never had that time.	Janipuniw uka tiempojj utjkitänti.
I’m so glad you’re doing well.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa, jumax wali sum jikxatastaxa.
I want to go with you.	Nayajj jumamp chik sarañ munta.
John doesn't think so.	Juanajj janiw ukham amuykiti.
I want meat.	Nayax aycha munta.
In fact, he was the one who told me about it.	Chiqpachansa, jupaw uka tuqit yatiyäna.
I immediately realized that.	Nayajj jankʼakiw ukham amuyayäta.
That was how he saw it now.	Ukhamwa jichhajj uñjäna.
He said he was a real good kind of person.	Jupajj cheqpach suma kasta jaqënwa sasaw säna.
It's a little boy.	Ukax jisk'a waynawa.
He was the one who told me.	Jupaw khitis sitäna.
He made the right decision.	Jupajj sumwa amtäna.
At the time, I knew what you were doing for me.	Uka tiemponjja, kuntï nayatak lurapkta uk sum yatta.
He’s having a lot of fun, too.	Jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi, ukhamaraki.
He just felt it, but he didn't do anything.	Jupajj ukhamakiw jikjjatasïna, ukampis janiw kuns lurkänti.
Now, I’m going to say this.	Jichhax, nayax akham sañ munta.
That doesn't mean it wasn't.	Ukajj janiw jan ukhamäkänti sañ munkiti.
He asked me to go.	Jupajj sarañatakiw mayïtu.
Wine and beer.	Vino ukat cerveza.
He could never do that.	Jupajj janipuniw uk lurañ puedkänti.
Something about an airplane.	Mä avión tuqit kunas.
Better than anyone could have known.	Khitis yatkaspa ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.

That’s what this will be.	Ukaw akax utjani.
Things just feel so good, so true to that.	Kunas ukhamakiw wali suma jikxatasi, wali chiqaw uka tuqitxa.

A first word.	Mä nayrïr aru.
And it was especially noticeable at the time.	Ukat uka tiemponjja, jukʼampiw amuyasïna.
But this was not anticipated.	Ukampis ukajj janiw nayratpach amuyaskänti.
So we drove off.	Ukatwa autot sarapjjta.
There was something special about it.	Ukanjja, kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
But the first time around.	Ukampis nayrïr kutix janiw ukhamäkiti.
I told him that you felt good.	Jumajj wali sum jikjjatasta sasaw jupar sista.
Tomorrow is coming soon.	Qhipürux niyaw purini.
They know how to drink.	Jupanakax umañ yatipxi.
It’s hard in this world.	Aka pachanx ch’amawa.
He squeezed her passionately.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw jupar chʼalljjtayasïna.
And that’s the kind of guy he is.	Ukat uka kasta waynax jupax ukhamawa.
That’s all you have to believe.	Ukakiw jumax iyaw sañama.
I’m going to leave it to someone else.	Nayax yaqha jaqiruw jaytañ munta.
What to do about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunsa lurañasa.
He immediately asked me to do it again.	Ukat jankʼakiw wasitat lurañajatak mayïtu.
This is something which is very important.	Akax mä kunaw kunatix wali wakiskiriwa.
He didn't really know anything about her.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun jupat kuns yatkänti.
I really think he is fine.	Chiqpachansa jupax walikïskiwa sasaw amuyta.
Better than anything he has done before.	Kuntï nayrajj lurkäna ukanakat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.
He wanted to ride a little more.	Jupax mä juk’amp kayuk sarañ munäna.
But no one knows his real name.	Ukampis janiw khitis chiqpach sutip yatkiti.
He did well tonight.	Jupax jichha arumax wali sum lurawayi.
A two-hour drive takes you to the town.	Pä horanak sarañax uka markaruw puri.
I’m also still here.	Nayax ukhamarakiw wali akanktxa.
Which, frankly, is fascinating.	Ukax, chiqpachansa, wali muspharkañawa.
How about the morning .	Kunjamsa alwajj .
But it will have to be done.	Ukampis uk lurañaw wakisini.
I think that’s important as well.	Nayax amuyta ukax wali wakiskiriwa ukhamaraki.
I didn’t want to.	Janiw munkayätti.
Great food, too.	Jach’a manq’a, ukhamaraki.
But it can't last long.	Ukampis janiw jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.
He was so friendly, as always, so lovely.	Jupajj wali suma jaqënwa, kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, wal munasïna.
And he just did it.	Ukat jupax ukhamakiw lurawayi.
He’s doing everything right.	Taqi kunsa sum luraski.
What is the best way to do that.	¿Kunas ukham lurañatakejj wali askïspa.
Every day almost.	Sapa uru niya.
And time is of the essence.	Ukat tiempojj wali wakiskiriwa.
I can’t make him do that.	Janiw nayax jupar ukham lurañapatak lurirjamäkti.
He promised to do so and took the money.	Ukham luram sasaw arsüna ukat uka qollqe apsüna.
It’s a little bit about me.	Nayat mä juk’a siwa.
She loves it and it looks great on her.	Jupax walpun munasi ukat juparux wali sumaw uñtasi.
I think we’ll do a better job.	Nayax amuyta, juk’amp suma irnaqäw lurañäni.
I want to live this.	Nayax aka jakañ munta.
He wanted to go back to sleep.	Jupax wasitat ikiñar sarañ munäna.
So they bought a house.	Ukatwa jupanakajj mä uta alasïna.
He’s very unhappy.	Jupax wali jan kusisitaw jikxatasi.
What do you think ?.	¿Kuns jumax amuyta ?.
So don't do that.	Ukhamajj jan ukham lurañamäkiti.
I didn’t realize that until now.	Ukxa janiw jichhakamax amuykayätti.
People were like that.	Jaqenakajj ukhamänwa.
But that's not all there is to it.	Ukampis janiw ukajj taqe kunas utjkiti.
He was a little rough.	Jupajj mä jukʼa qhuru jaqënwa.
But he didn't do that.	Ukampis jupajj janiw uk lurkänti.
He politely rejects me.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw nayarojj jan iyaw sañ muni.
But it didn't seem possible.	Ukampis janiw ukajj lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
Of course, you can do both.	Chiqansa, jumax panpachaniw lurasma.
A lot of time with you.	Walja tiempo jumamp chika.
It’s not the right thing to do.	Janiw ukax walïkiti.
I know about these things.	Ukanakat yattwa.
Well right now.	Suma chiqaw jichhax.
Not really sure what to do about this.	Janiw chiqpachapunix kuns aka tuqit lurañax wakiskiti.
I want to get some sleep.	Nayax mä juk’a ikiñar puriñ munta.
I didn't have that.	Ukajj janiw nayan utjkänti.
I’ve been in the past.	Nayax nayrax.
These are hard to do and very difficult to do well.	Ukanakax lurañax ch’amawa ukat sum lurañax wali ch’amawa.
He hadn't done that in the first place.	Nayratpach janiw jupajj ukham lurkänti.
I am very quiet now.	Jichhajj wali amukiw jikjjatasta.
He told me to do it.	Jupaw uk luram sasaw sitäna.
And yesterday, me.	Ukat qharüru, nayax.
He felt so comfortable, right at home.	Jupax wali sumaw jikxatasïna, chiqaw utapan jikxatasïna.
A snowflake, by the way.	Mä ch’uqi ch’uqi, ukhama.
And it’s good to go now.	Ukat jichhax sarañax wali askiwa.
And that doesn't matter .	Ukat ukajj janiw kunäkisa .
I understand why he went.	Kunatsa saräna uk sum amuyasta.
It rained for two more days.	Ukat jukʼamp pä uruw jallu purinïna.
No one had anything to do with anyone.	Janiw khitis khitimpis kuna lurañas utjkänti.
He was a bit early yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw mä juk’a alwax jikxatasïna.
That’s why he came, of course.	Ukatwa jupax jutäna, chiqpachansa.
Now, that could be something.	Jichhax, ukax mä kunaw utjaspa.
People are still hungry in the country.	Jaqinakax wali manq’at awtjataw uka markanx utji.
That was never the question.	Uka jisktʼajj janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I expect him anytime.	Nayax juparux kuna pachas suyt’ta.
He thought it was real.	Chiqpachapuniw sasaw amuyäna.
It’s been a long winter this time.	Juyphi pachax wali jaya pachaw aka kutix utjawayi.
And he's still going strong.	Ukat jupax wali chʼamampiw sarnaqaski.
But there is still a good deal.	Ukampis wali sumaw utji.
How do you know that.	¿Kunjamatsa uk yatta.
He’d enjoyed having dinner with her the previous evening.	Jupax nayrïr jayp’ux jupamp manq’añax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I don’t plan for that.	Nayax janiw ukatakix amtkti.
Every year is about	Sapa maraw niya .
Which is great and far from me.	Kawkïr jach’a ukat nayatakix wali jaya.
There was nothing wrong with it, that was it.	Jan walinak lurañaw utjäna, ukajj ukhamänwa.
He already feels like a bad guy doing that.	Jupajj ukham lurasajj niyaw jan wali jaqëkaspas ukham amuyasi.
He said that many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukham säna.
It’s funny, it’s funny.	Wali muspharkañawa, wali muspharkañawa.
Now this is down to some light rain.	Jichhax akax mä juk’a llamp’u jallu pacharuw puri.
Do what you have to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luram.
I’m alone in this country.	Nayax sapakiw aka markan jikxatastxa.
This is not a good thing to do.	Uka lurañajj janiw wali askïkiti.
He was staring at an exit door.	Jupajj mä mistuñ punku uñchʼukiskäna.
He had no idea how to take care of himself.	Jupajj kunjamsa jupa pachpa uñjasispa uk janiw amuykänti.
And yes it felt bad.	Ukat jïsa jan waliw amuyasïna.
Actually, I have two options.	Chiqansa, nayatakix pä lurañaw utji.
Tomorrow is the day before.	Qharüru nayra uru.
I knew nothing about it.	Ukanakat janiw kuns yatkayätti.
I want a big party.	Nayax mä jach’a fiesta munta.
But something still clicked.	Ukampis kunas wali chʼamampiw chʼalljjtayasïna.
Eventually, he went back on it.	Qhepatjja, uka toqet wasitatwa kuttʼjjäna.
He gives me something, he wants two more.	Jupax kuns churitu, jupax pä juk’amp munaraki.
He had a bad night.	Jupajj jan wali arumaw sarnaqäna.
Yes, of course, it felt that way.	Jïsa, chiqpachansa, ukhamaw amuyasïna.
Time he did not have.	Tiempojj jupajj janiw utjkänti.
And boy does it look good.	Ukat waynax wali suma uñtatawa.
The young man was alone.	Waynax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
I started a new job.	Mä machaq irnaqäw qalltawayta.
He found out a week later.	Jupajj mä semana qhepatwa yatïna.
But you understand.	Ukampis jumax amuyasta.
He ordered a drink.	Jupajj mä umañ mayïna.
He was watching everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa uñchʼukiskäna.
How time is passing.	Kunjamsa tiempojj pasaski.
He realized something in doing so.	Ukham lurasajj kunsa amuyasïna.
Someone gave me that guitar.	Mayniw uka guitarra churitu.
But you can do so much better than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
No one mentioned that stuff.	Janiw khitis uka yänak arskänti.
Here’ he says.	Akax’ sasaw saraki.
No one wants that to happen.	Janiw khitis ukham lurasiñap munkiti.
That’s what started things.	Ukaw kuns qalltäna.
But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t, of course.	Ukampis ukax janiw ukhamäkiti sañ munkiti, chiqpachansa.
You can do it all on your own.	Taqe ukanak juma pachpaw lurasma.
But this is more likely to happen.	Ukampis ukajj jukʼampiw pasaspa.
She didn't mean him any trouble.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis jupar sañ munkänti.
It wasn’t in there.	Janiw uka manqhan utjkänti.
That’s not me at all.	Ukax janiw nayax kunjamatsa.
You want a good meal.	Jumax mä suma manq’añ munta.
Because, to me, that’s a terrible place to be.	Kunatix, nayatakix ukax mä jan wali chiqaw sañ muni.
How do you know that?.	¿Kunjamatsa uk yatta?.
There is nothing wrong with that	Ukax janiw walïkiti .
And that’s what happened to me.	Ukat ukax nayaruw pasäna.
He found out this morning.	Jupax jichha alwaw uk yatïna.
He didn't know any better than that.	Jupajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp yatkänti.
He asked her what she wanted to talk about.	Ukat kuna tuqitsa parlañ munta sasaw jisktʼäna.
He’s tough, and you didn’t like it.	Jupax wali ch’amawa, ukat janiw jumarux gustkänti.
And really, there was nowhere else to go.	Ukat chiqpachansa, janiw yaqha chiqar sarañatak utjkänti.
We’ve had to do this for a long time.	Jiwasax wali jaya pachaw ukham lurañax wakisi.
He looks the same.	Jupajj pachpa uñnaqaniwa.
He could not do so many things at the same time.	Jupajj janiw mä tiempon ukham walja lurañanak lurañ puedkänti.
He was looking at the city.	Jupajj uka markaruw uñchʼukiskäna.
The incident was no problem at all.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Flat or not flat.	Ch’uqi jan ukax jan ch’uqi.
Every week is great.	Sapa semanaw jach’a.
He didn’t exist of course.	Jupax janiw utjkänti chiqpachansa.
I don't know what you want from me.	Janiw nayajj kuntï nayat munkta uk yatkti.
I thought he was in good spirits.	Jupajj suma amuyumpiw parläna sasaw amuyayäta.
I did it myself.	Naya pachpaw uk lurayäta.
I really didn’t know much about him.	Chiqpachansa janiw jupat wal yatkayätti.
Also, and .	Ukhamaraki, ukat .
Don't rush it.	Janiw jankʼak lurañamäkiti.
It looks really far away.	Chiqpachansa wali jaya chiqat uñtatawa.
The boy was alone.	Uka waynax sapakiw jikxatasïna.
Or there’s nothing there that’s good for you.	Jan ukax janiw kunas ukanx jumatakix askïkiti.
Or this one.	Jan ukax akax.
Maybe he can do something.	Inas jupajj kuns luraspa.
Or at least a little bit.	Jan ukajj mä jukʼa.
There was nothing there now.	Jichhajj janiw kunas ukan utjkänti.
That’s not what’s wrong with that.	Ukax janiw ukax jan walïkiti.
Let's see what you can do to help him.	Jupar yanaptʼañatakejj kunsa lurasma uk uñjañäni.
And that book.	Ukat uka libro.
I mean seriously.	Nayax sinti jach’a sañ munta.
He’s nobody like that.	Jupax janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.
It’s very quiet here today.	Jichhürunakanx wali amukiw akan jikxatasi.
You’re the best person to do it.	Jumax uka lurañatakix wali suma jaqiwa.
Not too big or too small.	Janiw sinti jach’a ni sinti jisk’a.
In fact, he had already done so.	Chiqansa, jupax nayratpach ukham luraskäna.
He didn’t know where to go from here.	Jupax janiw aka chiqat kawkirus sarañ yatkänti.
Someone who.	Maynix uka...
It took a long time to get there.	Ukar puriñkamax wali jaya tiempow munasïna.
It looks bad in every way.	Taqi tuqit jan wali uñtatawa.
Too soon, he told himself.	Wali jankʼakiw sasaw jupa pachpa säna.
Instead, you can do that.	Jan ukasti jumajj ukham lurasma.
I have never seen anyone faster.	Janipuniw khitirus jukʼamp jankʼak uñjkti.
And he’ll do something wrong.	Ukat jupax kuna jan walinak lurani.
He didn’t want anyone to hurt him.	Jupax janiw khitis jupar jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
But today, everything is going well.	Ukampis jichhürunakanjja, taqe kunas wali sumwa saraski.
A homeless man of course.	Mä jan utan jaqix chiqpachansa.
And as the sister never existed.	Ukat kunjamtï kullakajj janipuniw utjkänti.
Serious work was required.	Sinti lurañaw wakisïna.
They know what is right and what is wrong.	Kunatï walïki ukat jan walïki uk sum yatipxi.
Very foreign to me.	Nayatakix wali yaqha markankir jaqiwa.
I don’t think I’m going to do that.	Janiw nayax uk lurañ amtkti.
Perhaps he would have done so.	Inas jupajj ukham luraspäna.
Always strive for greater things.	Jukʼamp jachʼa lurañanak lurañatakejj sapa kutiw chʼamachasiñama.
But it wasn't clear at any point.	Ukampis janiw kuna horasas sum amuyaskänti.
He is the last one.	Jupajj qhep qhepa jaqewa.
More snow, more snow.	Juk’ampi ch’uqi, juk’ampi ch’uqi.
The point is, they don’t know.	Uka tuqitxa, jupanakax janiw yatipkiti.
It’s been there for a long time.	Ukax wali jaya pachaw ukan utji.
It does almost everything.	Niya taqe kunwa luraski.
He left it there.	Jupax ukan jaytawayi.
He built the house.	Utar lurawayi.
You really don’t want to stay.	Chiqpachansa janiw qhiparañ munktati.
But you know, these things happen.	Ukampis jumajj yatisktawa, ukanakaw pasaski.
He’s had a great year.	Jupax wali jach’a maraw jikxatasïna.
I think it’s amazing to go there.	Nayatakix uka chiqar sarañax wali muspharkañawa.
That’s pretty amazing to me.	Ukax nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.
I let out another sigh.	Nayax yaqha jach’a jach’a tukuñ jaytawayta.
Never, ever stop using it.	Janipuniw, janipuniw apnaqañ jaytañamäkiti.
I want to know why I say that.	Kunatsa ukham sista uk yatiñ munta.
In fact, it gets better.	Chiqansa, juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He slept fast last night.	Jupax qhipa arumax wali jaya ikiskäna.
It’s nice to do it somewhere else.	Yaqha chiqan lurañax wali askiwa.
If you do it right, you’ll feel amazingly good.	Suma lurasax muspharkañ sumaw jikxatasïta.
Finally, he pulled hard.	Qhepatjja, wali chʼamampiw jaqontäna.
It really didn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukax wakiskänti.
That's what you shouldn't forget.	Ukajj jumajj jan armasimti.
He thought she looked kind of nice.	Jupajj mä jukʼa suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
I didn't quite understand it until now.	Jichhakamajj janiw uk sum amuykayätti.
Nothing works better.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum irnaqkiti.
He didn't want to rush.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak sarnaqañ munkänti.
He’s like that .	Jupax ukham .
He knew he would never do it.	Janipuniw uk lurkäti uk sum yatïna.
There’s a place for that.	Ukatakix mä chiqaw utji.
I told him I was really curious about it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uka tuqit yatxatañ munta sasaw sista.
He reluctantly agreed.	Jan munasiñampiw iyaw säna.
I’ve definitely seen it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uñjta.
It’s not like anything happens.	Janiw kunjamtï kunas luraski ukhamäkiti.
Twice as many more.	Pä kuti juk’ampi.
Of course, it didn't need to be.	Chiqansa, janiw ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
Or the word.	Jan ukax aru.
I want to walk through this.	Nayax aka tuqit sarnaqañ munta.
It was another rainy morning.	Ukajj yaqha jallu alwaw utjäna.
This was obviously not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanawa.
Also he was very surprised.	Ukhamaraki jupax wal muspharäna.
Let’s see who said what.	Khitis kuns säna uk uñjañäni.
That’s why you have to do it.	Ukatwa ukham lurañama.
I said yes of course.	Nayax chiqpachansa jïsa sasaw sista.
That’s the first time this season.	Ukax nayrïr kutiw aka pachanx utjawayi.
I really don't see how that works.	Chiqpachansa janiw kunjamsa ukax askïspa uk uñjkti.
But of course he didn’t know.	Ukampis chiqansa jupax janiw yatkänti.
But that’s not all of that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kunas ukhamäkiti.
It flows like a film.	Ukax mä película ukham jallu.
And wherever .	Ukat kawkhansa .
But he refused to abandon the idea.	Ukampis janiw uka amtar jaytañ munkänti.
As it happened, he was right.	Kunjamtï paskäna ukhama, jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
I want to withdraw money.	Nayax qullqi apsuñ munta.
The problem is not as simple as you might think.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw kunjamtï jumajj amuykta ukhamäkiti.
I don't want to get in there.	Nayajj janiw uka cheqar mantañ munkti.
Like in a week.	Kunjamtï mä semanan luraski ukhama.
I hope to get into it soon.	Nayax jank’akiw ukar mantañ suyt’askta.
You’re the guy.	Jumax uka waynawa.
And that speaks for itself.	Ukat ukax jupa pachpaw arsu.
He loved beer, but rarely drank it.	Jupajj cerveza wal munäna, ukampis jukʼakiw umañ yatïna.
I’ve decided to do so.	Nayax ukham amtawayta.
Things you can do, things you can’t do.	Kunanaktï lurañjamäki, kunanaktï jan lurañjamäki ukanak.
He understood me well.	Jupajj nayaruw sum amuyäna.
He pulled out the words.	Jupajj uka arunak apsüna.
Of course, he didn't notice.	Chiqansa, janiw amuyaskänti.
And surely there will be next time.	Ukat chiqpachansa jutïr kutin utjani.
Try to make yourself feel bad.	Juma pachpa jan walinak lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
They’re all really great to me.	Taqinipuniw chiqpachapuniw nayatakix wali jach’a.
That could take a year or so.	Ukatakejj mä mara jan ukajj mä maraw munasispa.
I just needed one.	Mä sapakiw munasïna.
So don’t do it alone.	Ukhamajj janiw sapak lurañamäkiti.
I wasn't sure why this happened.	Kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw sum amuykayätti.
I forced myself to do it.	Uka lurañatakejj naya pachpaw chʼamachasiyäta.
He’s already known.	Jupax nayratpach uñt’atawa.
Of course he says no.	Chiqansa jupax janiw sasaw arsuwayi.
He died a long time ago.	Jupajj walja tiempow jiwjjäna.
Maybe that doesn't matter.	Inas ukajj jan kunäkisa.
All of these are more important.	Taqe ukanakajj jukʼamp wakiskiriwa.
But he knows it happened, now.	Ukampis jupax yatiw ukax pasäna, jichhax.
It will be so quiet.	Ukhama amukiw utjani.
He makes the decision himself.	Jupa pachpaw uka amtar puri.
And the boy was silent.	Ukat uka waynax amukiw jikxatasïna.
It will happen to you.	Ukajj jumaruw pasani.
The problem is immediate.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj jankʼakiw utji.
When he arrives, he is alone.	Ukar purisajj sapakiw jikjjatasi.
Now may never be that time.	Jichhajj inas janipuniw uka tiempojj utjkaspati.
I feel so much better.	Nayax walpun sum jikxatastxa.
Word to anyone here.	Aru khitirus aka chiqan.
Still looks a little rough.	Wali mä juk’a qhuru uñnaqaniwa.
I never did that, I never did that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkti, janipuniw ukham lurkti.
Now is the perfect time.	Jichhajj uka tiempojj walikïskiwa.
He is very unbearable.	Jupajj wali jan aguantañjamäkiti.
People are important to you.	Jaqinakax jumatakix wali askiwa.
I don’t want to repeat it.	Nayax janiw wasitat arsuñ munkti.
He said he only wanted to use it once.	Mä kutikiw apnaqañ munta sasaw säna.
Still far alone.	Wali jaya sapaki.
Another very nice one.	Yaqha wali suma.
I’m still coming on.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw jutta.
It will happen all the time.	Ukajj sapa kutiw pasani.
I don’t think he knows.	Nayax janiw jupax yatkti.
He said he did have it.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw utjitu sasaw säna.
I think he can do it.	Nayax amuyta jupax luraspawa.
He is a man who does nothing.	Jupajj jan kuns lurir jaqewa.
We need to do this properly .	Ukajj sumwa lurañasa .
Now, there is no one here.	Jichhax, janiw khitis akan utjkiti.
He knew how to play football.	Jupajj pelot anattʼañ yatïna.
So much better, much better.	Ukhamajj jukʼamp askiwa, jukʼamp askiwa.
And so, and so one.	Ukat ukhama, ukat ukhama mä.
There he learned a lot.	Ukanjja, walpun yateqäna.
And he was obsessed with it for a while.	Ukat mä jukʼa tiempow uka toqet chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
I’m still in pain.	Nayax wali llakitaw jikxatasi.
I realize now that this was not the case for me.	Nayatakejj janiw ukhamäkänti, uk jichhajj amuyasta.
And he wanted to do that.	Ukat ukham lurañwa munäna.
It’s all about you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix ukhamawa.
Everything doesn’t work.	Taqi kunas janiw irnaqkiti.
Another bad day.	Yaqha jan wali uru.
But this will be two nights alone.	Ukampis akax pä arumaw sapakix utjani.
A beautiful place to visit.	Mä suma uñjañ chiqa.
Now, pretty much everyone knows that.	Jichhax, niya taqiniw uk yatipxi.
But he could do them just as well.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw jupanakar luraspäna.
He’s really tall and big.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw jach’a jach’a ukat jach’a jaqiwa.
In fact, that was all there was.	Chiqansa, ukakiw utjäna.
Too long, in fact.	Sinti jaya tiempo, chiqpachansa.
That’s exactly what you need to do.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunatix lurañax wakisi.
Exactly and it happened.	Chiqpachansa ukat ukhamarakiw pasäna.
He loved her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa jupar munasïna.
But it was nothing, not really.	Ukampis janiw kunas ukhamäkänti, janiw chiqpachansa ukhamäkänti.
That’s about twice that amount.	Uka qullqix niya pä kutiw utji.
I haven’t seen anyone yet.	Janiw khitirus jichhakamax uñjkti.
I would love to talk to you.	Jumampi parltʼañ wal munta.
That means all the time.	Ukajj taqe tiempo sañ muni.
No time for that here.	Ukatakix janiw tiempox akan utjkiti.
Now it’s time to act.	Jichhax lurañ pachaw purini.
I think it’s the only thing that needs to be done right.	Nayax amuyta, ukakiw chiqapar lurañax wakisi.
So that was obvious.	Ukhamajj ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
It almost feels like it.	Niya ukhamarakiw ukham amuyasi.
Money can do anything.	Qullqix kuns luraspawa.
I can do anything.	Nayax kuns lurasmati.
You look so hot there.	Jumax ukan wali junt’u uñnaqaniwa.
He was very cautious about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali amuyumpiw sarnaqäna.
In fact, it’s what you do.	Chiqansa, kuntï jumax lurasma ukawa.
He that night.	Jupa uka arumax.
They had nothing for me.	Jupanakajj janiw kunas nayatak utjkänti.
He walked away very quietly.	Jupajj wali amukiw uka cheqar sarjjäna.
I don't know how to manage that much money.	Janiw kunjamsa uka walja qollqe apnaqañ yatkti.
There is no reason but .	Janiw kuna razonas utjkiti jan ukasti .
I'd like to know more.	Jukʼamp yatiñ munasma.
You have to do it yourself, alone.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama, sapakiw lurañama.
I don’t want to use it.	Nayax janiw apnaqañ munkti.
It seemed more appropriate.	Ukax juk’amp askïkaspas ukhamaw amuyasïna.
He wondered when that would happen.	Jupajj kunapachas ukham pasaspa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
He repeated what he had said earlier.	Ukat nayrajj kuntï siskäna uk wasitatwa arsüna.
First things first.	Nayrïr kunaw nayraqat.
He agreed very reluctantly.	Jupax wali jan munasiñampiw iyaw säna.
Never a bad day, really.	Janipuniw jan wali urux utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
But he makes a wise decision.	Ukampis wali amuyumpiw mä amtar puri.
I don’t want to tell you that.	Janiw nayax ukham yatiyañ munkti.
He walked backwards.	Jupajj qhepatwa sarnaqäna.
That was what kept him from speaking.	Ukaw jan parlañ puedkänti.
It will be very nice.	Wali sumaw utjani.
Yes, he loved it.	Jïsa, jupajj wal munasïna.
Everyone needs to do that.	Taqinipuniw ukham lurañax wakisi.
I didn’t want to leave him.	Janiw jupar jaytañ munkayätti.
I didn’t go then.	Nayax janiw uka pachax sarkti.
I want a real life.	Nayax chiqpach jakañ munta.
Definitely more needs to be done.	Chiqpachansa jukʼamp lurañaw wakisi.
This is my only money.	Akax nayan sapakiw qullqix utji.
You’re pretty much alone.	Jumax niya sapakiw jikxatastaxa.
Mary did everything.	Mariajj taqe kunwa luräna.
You didn’t surprise me.	Jumax janiw nayar muspharkayätti.
This happened several times, of course.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasäna, ukhamänwa.
He saw it very well.	Jupax wali suma uñjäna.
I don’t know who I am.	Janiw khitis nayax sañ munkti.
It was a very happy moment.	Uka pachax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I don’t want that to happen to him.	Janiw jupar ukham pasañap munkti.
He is himself himself.	Jupa pachpaw jupa pachpa.
Amazing how much snow there is this year.	Muspharkañ qawqha ch’uqi ch’uqi aka marax utji.
This is really cool isn’t it?.	Akax chiqpachansa wali sumawa ¿janich ukhamäki?.
I can’t remember many more like that.	Nayax juk’amp walja ukham ukham amtaskti.
I enjoyed it and wanted to improve it.	Ukajj wal gustitu ukat jukʼamp sum lurañwa munta.
Eventually he hit the mark.	Qhipharux markaruw ch’allt’äna.
Things are not right.	Kunanakas janiw walïkiti.
So, there are two things you can do.	Ukhama, pä lurañaw utji.
And I really like that.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax nayatakix wali askiwa.
No, don't forget it.	Janiwa, uk armasimti.
I can’t do anything right now.	Jichhax janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti.
Everything is unique.	Taqi kunas jan uñt’atawa.
It cannot last long.	Janiw jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.
It’s a great place to stay.	Ukax mä jach’a uñt’atawa.
I want to know this stuff.	Nayax aka yänak yatxatañ munta.
I feel good about doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali sumwa jikjjatasta.
He did exactly what he said he would do.	Kuntï siskäna uk sumwa luräna.
It shook the house.	Ukax uta ch’allxtayäna.
And of course he is fine.	Ukat chiqansa jupax walikïskiwa.
It’s been around for many years.	Walja maranakaw utji.
Two things struck me.	Pä kunaw nayarojj walpun muspharäna.
I heard him a couple of times.	Mä pä kutiw jupar istʼta.
It’s a nice sight.	Mä suma uñtatawa.
He knew all the languages.	Jupajj taqe arunak sum yatïna.
This person knows how to live.	Aka jaqix jakañ yati.
And he didn’t know about it.	Ukat jupax janiw uka tuqit yatkänti.
Do it in the real world.	Chiqpach pachan lurañamawa.
But I didn't do anything.	Ukampis janiw nayajj kuns lurkti.
Tonight was amazing night.	Jichha arumax muspharkañ arumaw utjäna.
Except, of course.	Jan ukasti, chiqpachansa.
Not bad, but not good enough.	Janiw jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw walïkiti.
There would be nothing there.	Ukanjja, janiw kunas utjkaspati.
He chooses to do it infrequently .	Jupajj jan sapa kuti lurañwa amti .
So that's how he sees it.	Ukhamajj ukhamwa jupajj uñji.
I like to do it myself.	Naya pachpaw lurañax wal gustitu.
I’m not sure what’s going on from here.	Nayax janiw kunas aka chiqat pasaski ukx yatkti.
Every single one of them is me.	Sapa mayniw nayax.
But he was an amazing man.	Ukampis jupajj wali muspharkañ jaqënwa.
And ten more and nothing.	Ukat tunka juk’ampi ukat janiw kunas utjkiti.
This is the real thing.	Akax chiqpach uñt’atawa.
I would buy this beer again.	Nayax wasitat aka cerveza alañ munta.
And just like that he went for it.	Ukat ukhamakiw jupax ukatakix saräna.
He pulled it off pretty well.	Jupajj wali sumwa uka toqet apsüna.
He has no reason to.	Jupax janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
He took the book from me.	Jupaw uka libro nayat apsüna.
You’re the only one who knows about this, right now.	Juma sapakiw aka tuqit yatta, jichhax.
He thinks he’s in charge.	Jupax jupaw apnaqi sasaw amuyi.
He knows it well .	Jupajj uk sum yati .
He asked her what she wanted.	Ukat kuntï munkta uk jisktʼäna.
He says he doesn’t remember.	Jupax janiw amtaskti sasaw saraki.
This thing is really fun.	Aka kunas chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
Great dining room as well.	Jach’a manq’añ uta ukhamaraki.
He had no idea what could happen to him today.	Jichhürunakan kunas jupar pasaspa uk janiw amuykänti.
It’s what it means with you.	Ukax kuntix jumamp chika sañ munki ukawa.
It’s very possible that you can have both.	Panpachaniw utjaspa ukax wali ch’amawa.
So he bought a car.	Ukatwa mä auto alasïna.
Of course, he knows all about it.	Chiqansa, jupax taqi ukanak sum yati.
Tell him that you really enjoyed it.	Chiqpachansa, jumax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïta sasaw jupar sañama.
I know what happened to you.	Nayajj yattwa kunas jumanakar pasäna.
He appreciated both.	Jupajj panpachaniw wali askit uñjäna.
But no one said a word.	Ukampis janiw khitis mä arunak arskänti.
I hear almost everything.	Niya taqe kunwa istʼta.
But the man .	Ukampis uka jaqejj .
He will do it.	Jupajj uk lurani.
He longed to get home.	Jupajj utar puriñ wal munäna.
He understood why.	Kunatsa uk sum amuyäna.
He wasn't sure what to make of her.	Jupajj kunsa jupat luraspa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
There was no one else at the time.	Uka pachanx janiw yaqha jaqix utjkänti.
I don’t get this at all.	Nayax janiw akax kuns jikxatkti.
I want to give it to him.	Nayax jupar churañ munta.
He doesn't know what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa janiw yatkiti.
I see two ways to do this.	Uk lurañatakix pä lurañanak uñjta.
He arrived a little after ten in the morning.	Jupajj tunka alwat mä jukʼa qhepatwa purinïna.
I went on the phone.	Nayax telefonot sarawayta.
This is the most important thing.	Ukajj taqe kunat sipansa wali wakiskiriwa.
Of course, anyone can do that.	Chiqansa, khitis ukham luraspawa.
Everything is fine of course.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa chiqpachansa.
But something worse is happening.	Ukampis jukʼamp jan waliw pasaski.
But if he’s in trouble, she’s the one.	Ukampis jupax jan walt’äwin uñjasispa ukhax jupaw jikxatasïna.
That person can’t do it.	Uka jaqix janiw lurañjamäkiti.
It’s good for him, of course, though.	Juparux wali askiwa, chiqpachansa, ukampis.
That's what he likes.	Ukaw jupajj wal gusti.
Now he can't do anything.	Jichhax janiw kuns lurkaspati.
In this case, no.	Uka tuqitxa, janiwa.
It is better than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.
It doesn’t take long.	Ukax janiw jaya pachax munaskiti.
The weather is almost always warm and pleasant.	Pachax niya sapa kutiw junt’u ukat wali suma.
No one knows what we will do.	Kunsa lurañäni uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
As things happen.	Kunjamtï kunas pasaski ukhama.
I feel that way this morning.	Jichha alwajj ukhamwa amuyasta.
But no one will do that.	Ukampis janiw khitis ukham lurkaniti.
But there is no bedroom.	Ukampis janiw ikiñ utax utjkiti.
I’m a new person maybe I’m hoping so.	Nayax machaq jaqix inas ukham suyt’askta.
He will build a house.	Jupaw mä uta lurani.
We weren’t too surprised.	Jiwasax janiw sinti muspharkayätti.
He really wanted to take care of her.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jupar sum uñjañ munäna.
Where’s the food.	Kawkhans manq’añax utji.
He wants to get home himself.	Jupa pachpaw utapar puriñ muni.
I’m afraid of that.	Nayax ukham axsaratwa.
He was a very tall man .	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqënwa .
I love it right now.	Nayax jichhax walpun munasta.
He says everything is fine.	Jupax taqi kunas walikïskiwa sasaw saraki.
You know how much you love him.	Jumajj kunjamsa jupar munasta uk sum amuyasta.
And he immediately told her.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupar yatiyäna.
Honestly, really this is amazing.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa akax muspharkañawa.
Or worse, it needs to be done.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
I totally understand you .	Nayax jumat taqpach amuyta .
I thought that was really good.	Chiqpachansa ukax wali askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
It is the way people are.	Kunjamtï jaqenakajj utjki ukawa.
This is the yes.	Akax jïsa.
Christmas is coming soon and all that.	Navidad ukax niyaw purini ukat taqi ukanak.
That man is a great man.	Uka jaqejj mä jachʼa jaqewa.
What's going on tonight.	Kunas jichha arumax saraski.
How he behaved .	Kunjamsa jupax sarnaqäna .
He loved his new name.	Jupajj machaq sutip wal munäna.
I am very happy for you.	Jumanakat wal kusista.
But he never said he was good.	Ukampis janipuniw suma jaqïtwa siskänti.
I don’t know what to do with him now.	Jichhax janiw kuns jupamp lurañax yatkti.
At the time, it was just .	Uka tiemponjja, ukhamakiw .
These people have nothing.	Uka jaqinakax janiw kunas utjkiti.
Or really who he is anymore.	Jan ukax chiqpachansa khitis jupax juk’ampi.
There’s a big one.	Jach’a mayniw utji.
He wouldn't do it again, ever.	Jupajj janiw mayampsa uk lurkaspänti, janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti.
He always gives me cigarettes.	Jupajj sapa kuti cigarro churitu.
But why, of course, .	Ukampis kunatsa, chiqpachansa, .
But beyond that, not really.	Ukampis ukat sipansa, janiw chiqpachansa.
It’s also very exciting.	Ukhamaraki wali kusiskañawa.
No one was in the area.	Janiw khitis uka cheqan utjkänti.
Well a year later.	Suma mä mara qhepatjja.
He couldn't believe how scared he was.	Kunjamsa ajjsaräna uk janiw iyaw sañ munkänti.
I know you love her so much.	Nayax yattwa jumax juparux walpun munasma.
I don't want to talk to him.	Nayajj janiw jupamp parlañ munkti.
That guy is amazing.	Uka waynax muspharkañawa.
I think they .	Nayax amuyta jupanakax .
But nothing really happens.	Ukampis janiw kunas chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
Not as a human being would.	Janiw kunjamtï mä jaqejj lurkaspänti.
Everything is going well.	Taqi kunas wali sum saraski.
I have difficulty eating.	Nayax manq’añax ch’amawa.
That’s what he told me.	Ukhamaw jupax sitäna.
So I guess I can do that.	Ukhamajj nayajj ukanak lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyta.
Now let’s do something about it.	Jichhax kunsa uka tuqit lurañäni.
I’m older, you know.	Nayax jilïr jaqïtwa, jumax yatisktawa.
It is as it is now.	Kunjamtï jichhajj utjki ukawa.
I don’t know what’s going to happen to him.	Janiw kunas jupar pasani uk yatkti.
It looks better now.	Jichhax juk’amp sumaw uñjasi.
But he definitely feels that way to me.	Ukampis jupajj cheqapuniw nayatakejj ukham amuyasi.
He hurried to his bedroom.	Jupax jank’akiw ikiñ utapar sarxäna.
Good beer, he said.	Suma cerveza, sasaw säna.
It all turned out to be important.	Taqi kunas wali wakiskiriwa sasaw jikxatasïna.
He says almost everything.	Niya taqi ukanak arsu.
In fact, he called several times.	Chiqansa walja kutiw jawsäna.
We have something here.	Jiwasax akanx kunas utjistu.
There is no time or wrong time.	Janiw kuna pachas ni jan wali pachas utjkiti.
People are not necessary.	Jaqinakax janiw wakiskiti.
I want to go the other way.	Nayax yaqha tuqit sarañ munta.
He saw things.	Jupax yänak uñjäna.
You would be interested in this.	Jumax uka tuqitxa wali askïspawa.
Very rarely will he leave on his own.	Wali jukʼakiw jupa pachpa sarxani.
It feels like it.	Ukhama jikxatasi.
He died last year.	Jupajj pasïr maraw jiwjjäna.
And they can barely have anything.	Ukat jupanakax jukʼakiw kunas utjaspa.
Maybe there’s something here.	Inas akan kunas utjaspa.
But there’s something about you.	Ukampis jumat kunas utji.
He had nothing to do with you.	Jupajj janiw jumamp kuns lurkänti.
Him or me.	Jupar jan ukajj naya.
I want them all.	Nayax taqiniruw munta.
I don’t want to see them again.	Janiw jupanakar mayamp uñjañ munkti.
This will do me!.	¡Akax nayaruw lurani!.
You know, he really is.	Jumax yatisktawa, jupax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
It’s going to take some time.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw munasini.
That’s all that really matters.	Ukakiw chiqpachapunix wakisi.
It’s what he wants most.	Ukax kuntix jupax juk’amp munki ukawa.
I give unfair life.	Nayax jan chiqapar jakañ churta.
He is doing what he is supposed to do.	Kuntï lurañapäki uk sumwa luraski.
I don’t need to do any of that.	Nayax janiw ukanak lurañax wakiskiti.
He looks like thirty.	Jupax kimsa tunka uñnaqaniwa.
He was the one who told me.	Jupaw yatiyäna.
Almost nothing at all.	Niya janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
So why not??.	Ukhamajj kunatsa jan??.
I want you better.	Nayajj jumar jukʼamp sumwa munta.
I don't want to suggest that now.	Jichhajj janiw uk amuytʼayañ munkti.
The school with me.	Nayamp chika yatiqañ uta.
Very sad about it.	Wali llakitaw uka tuqitxa.
I want a guy like you.	Nayax jumar uñtasit mä waynaruw munta.
He was looking under his eyes.	Jupajj nayranakap manqhan uñchʼukiskäna.
That’s exactly what happened.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw utjawayi.
In fact, he wanted to do bad things.	Chiqansa, jan walinak lurañ wal munäna.
I’ve already said too much.	Nayax nayratpach sinti arsuwayta.
I’m already feeling better.	Nayax niyaw juk’amp sum jikxatasiyäta.
The same is true of the character.	Ukhamarakiw sarnaqäna.
Three bad coins.	Kimsa jan wali qullqi.
Where, how big, and kind of.	Kawkhansa, qawqha jach’a, ukat mä kasta.
And there will be a next time, he says.	Ukat jutïr kutin utjani, sasaw saraki.
I decided to do more.	Jukʼamp lurañ amtawayta.
I look forward to working on that more.	Nayax uka juk’amp irnaqañ suyt’askta.
Strange how he didn't realize it until now.	Muspharkañawa kunjamsa jichhakamax jan uk amuyaskänti.
That was the case for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj ukhamänwa.
Last night was the first time.	Qhipa arumax nayrïr kutiw utjäna.
He was afraid to sleep.	Jupajj ikiñar wal ajjsaräna.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumar walpun munasi.
He did this many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ukham luräna.
He immediately got to work.	Jupajj jankʼakiw irnaqañ qalltäna.
So there was more where that came from.	Ukhamajj kawkhantï ukajj jutäna ukajj jukʼampiw utjäna.
Yesterday was really hard for me.	Qharürux chiqpachansa nayatakix wali ch’amawa.
Tomorrow is the first thing to do.	Qhipürux nayrïr lurañaw wakisi.
He snowballs and he snores and he snores.	Jupax ch’uqi ch’uqi ukat jupax ch’uqi ch’uqi ukat jupax ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I don’t think I’m buying this.	Nayax janiw nayax aka alañ munkti.
I am quite happy with all of this.	Nayajj taqe ukanak wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Make it the way you want it.	Kunjamtï jumax munkta ukhamarjam luram.
He’s a man of few words.	Jupax mä qawqha arunak parlir jaqiwa.
I asked him what he thought.	Ukat kunsa amuyi sasaw jisktʼta.
He knew it was now or never.	Jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
still, who knows.	wali, khitis yati.
Now he’s still strong.	Jichhax jupax wali ch’amawa.
That’s why it’s not.	Ukatwa jan ukhamäkiti.
I think it’s pretty bad.	Nayax wali jan waliw sasaw amuyta.
It will be needed in the future.	Jutïr tiemponjja, ukajj munasini.
He must act quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw lurañapa.
And you can do much worse.	Ukat jukʼamp jan walinak lurasma.
Make that film.	Uka película lurañamawa.
So now this is it.	Ukhamajj jichhajj aka.
And he felt good for a long time.	Ukat walja tiempow sum jikjjatasïna.
Time flew by quickly.	Tiempojj jankʼakiw sarjjäna.
Almost no one understands.	Niya janiw khitis amuykiti.
That’s funny about this.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa aka tuqitxa.
So he was pretty good for a while.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempojj wali suma jaqënwa.
I want to take this seriously.	Nayax akax wali askit uñjañ munta.
Not good, but okay.	Janiw askïkiti, jan ukasti walikïskiwa.
I want to do well.	Nayajj sum lurañwa munta.
He didn’t do it.	Janiw uk lurkänti.
It was like there was nothing I could do.	Janis kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
It really took a long time.	Chiqpachansa, ukatakix walja tiempow munasïna.
Or he walked too fast.	Jan ukajj wali jankʼak sarnaqäna.
That’s not a bad thing, but it’s not good for me.	Ukax janiw jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
It is all he has.	Ukajj taqe kunatï jupan utjki ukawa.
A lot of time alone.	Walja tiempo sapaki.
Or he thought it wasn't about himself.	Jan ukajj janiw jupa pachpat sañ munkiti sasaw amuyäna.
He gave me the wine.	Jupaw uka vino churitu.
Really long time.	Chiqpachansa jaya tiempo.
These things happened very quickly.	Ukanakajj wali jankʼakiw pasäna.
Everything in it is power.	Taqi kunatix ukan utjki ukax ch’amawa.
You think that happened.	Jumax ukham pasäna sasaw amuyta.
Who told him that.	Khitis jupar ukham yatiyäna.
And he went yesterday.	Ukat jupax qharüruw saräna.
I’ve seen it in every country.	Nayax sapa markan uñjta.
He wants to do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañ muni.
No one but him.	Janiw khitis jupat sipansa.
Now he was watching her closely.	Jichhajj jupar wali sum uñjäna.
He went everywhere with me.	Jupajj nayamp chikaw taqe cheqar saräna.
This is our new home.	Akax jiwasan machaq utar uñtatawa.
It’s not what you want.	Janiw kuntï munkta ukhamäkiti.
But can it really happen?.	Ukampis ¿chiqapunit uka tuqit pasaspa?.
He practically warned her.	Jupajj niyaw jupar ewjjtʼäna.
I mean everything.	Nayax taqi kun sañ munta.
I always see someone else.	Nayax sapa kutiw yaqha jaqir uñjta.
So somehow.	Ukhamajj kunjamatsa.
Small or no meat.	Jisk’a jan ukax jan aycha.
I’m going to find out as soon as possible.	Nayax jank’akiw yatxatañ munta.
That was something you said.	Ukajj mä kuntï jumajj siskta ukhamänwa.
I left it there.	Ukan jaytawayta.
He's in trouble here.	Jupax akanx jan walt'äwin jikxatasi.
I love it so much.	Nayax ukat walpun munta.
Someone took care of it.	Mayniw ukanak sum uñjäna.
I don't remember much about him.	Janiw jupat jukʼamp amtaskti.
I want this year.	Nayax aka marax munta.
It’s what one can do in this situation.	Ukax kuntix maynix aka jan walt’äwin luraspa ukawa.
Something big and bad and weird.	Kunas jach’a ukat jan wali ukat muspharkañ.
That’s the adult.	Ukax jilïr jaqiwa.
They are fierce and cold.	Jupanakax wali qhuru, thaya ukhamaraki.
Everything is fine, he said.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa, sasaw säna.
If anyone does that .	Khitis ukham luraspa ukhajja .
He thought someone needed help somewhere.	Maynix kawkhans yanaptʼa munasispa sasaw amuyäna.
I hear a lot about these things.	Ukanakat walpun istʼta.
I realized this the other day.	Nayax yaqha urux uk amuyasta.
Now, there’s something.	Jichhax, kunas utji.
The person can take care of himself.	Uka jaqejj jupa pachpaw sum uñjasispa.
He stared at them for a moment.	Jupajj mä jukʼa tiempow jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna.
The same person doesn’t matter.	Pachpa jaqix janiw kunäkisa.
This one worked very well.	Akax wali sum irnaqäna.
He was eager to provide such a home .	Jupajj ukham mä uta churañ wal munäna .
But they obviously do better.	Ukampis qhanaw jukʼamp sum lurañ yatipxi.
But he decides to do so.	Ukampis ukham lurañ amti.
That lasted about a week.	Ukajj niya mä semanaw utjäna.
But he will do it.	Ukampis jupaw uk lurani.
But I didn't understand	Ukampis janiw amuykayätti .
So it's not the worst of all.	Ukhamajj janiw taqe kunat sipansa jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
The weather will be better tomorrow.	Qhipürux pachax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
The guy didn’t feel that way.	Uka waynax janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
Now is a time for the truth.	Jichhax mä pachaw chiqaw sañ muni.
He felt it wasn’t.	Jupax janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
He’s in love and she’s in love.	Jupax munasiñampiw ukat jupax wali munasiñampiw sarnaqäna.
But no one wants to know about it.	Ukampis janiw khitis uka tuqit yatiñ munkiti.
You’ll feel really good.	Chiqpachansa wali sumwa jikxatasïta.
Interestingly, though, this is not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
Heart, that’s just it.	Chuyma, ukax ukhamakiw.
I think he can do it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak luraspawa sasaw amuyta.
I think he’s mature about it.	Nayatakix jupax uka tuqitx jilïr jaqiwa.
It’s something you would do anything to avoid.	Mä kunaw jan lurañatakix kuns lurasma.
It’s one of the things he does all the time.	Ukax sapa kuti luratapat maynïriwa.
He sees a lot.	Jupax walpun uñji.
I couldn't do it for him.	Nayajj janiw jupatak uk lurirjamäkti.
Of course, it doesn’t matter.	Chiqansa, janiw kunäkisa.
She’s in bed with him there.	Jupampiw ukan ikiñan jikxatasi.
But in this other case.	Ukampis aka yaqha tuqitxa.
He called her out on it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa jupar jawsäna.
I can’t say for sure.	Janiw chiqpachapunix sañjamäkiti.
Do what you need today.	Jichhürunakan kunatï wakiski uk luram.
He remained silent for a long time.	Jupajj jaya tiempojj janiw kuns arskänti.
But he couldn't do it well.	Ukampis janiw uk sum lurañ puedkänti.
He is a young man.	Jupajj waynawa.
This is exactly what it should be.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw kunjamtï lurañax wakiski ukhama.
But he couldn't, not now.	Ukampis janiw puedkänti, janiw jichhajj ukham lurkänti.
How long does it last?.	¿Qhawqha pachas ukax utji?.
So I'm just like that.	Ukhamajj nayajj ukhamawa.
There is no way they exist.	Janiw kunjamatsa jupanakajj utjkiti.
Which is definitely not the case.	Ukax chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti.
He thought that was a good thing.	Ukajj wali askiwa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
For me this said it all.	Nayatakix akax taqi kuns arsüna.
He never wanted to walk you.	Jupajj janipuniw jumar sarnaqañ munkänti.
A chance to learn.	Yatiqañ utar sarañatakix mä ch’am.
He didn't, he said.	Jupajj janiw uk lurkänti, sasaw säna.
Now he has to do what he does best.	Jichhajj kuntï sum lurkäna uk lurañapawa.
I asked him what he wanted to do.	Kun lurañsa munta sasaw jisktʼta.
That’s actually really important.	Chiqpachansa ukax chiqpachansa wali wakiskiriwa.
But most of all .	Ukampis taqe kunat sipansa .
That, too, is not a bad thing.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw janiw jan walïkiti.
As a.	Kunjamtï mä.
Now everyone’s a lot of money.	Jichhax taqiniw walja qullqi.
Everything you see inside is like something you see inside.	Taqi kunatix manqhan uñjkta ukax mä kunaw manqhan uñjta ukhama.
And it’s midnight.	Ukat chika arumaw purini.
I came anyway.	Nayax kunjamatsa jutta.
I’m going to investigate.	Nayax yatxatañ munta.
I sincerely hope so.	Taqi chuymaw ukham suytʼaskta.
Of course, things are much better than that.	Chiqansa, kunanakas ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
I have always seen this place.	Nayax nayratpach aka chiqar uñjta.
I'm sure he hadn't done that before then.	Uka tiempon nayrajj janiw ukham lurkänti, uk sum yatta.
He drove to town.	Jupax autot markaruw saräna.
This guy doesn’t really know how to use the word.	Aka waynax janiw chiqpachansa uka aru apnaqañ yatkiti.
And I didn’t really need to.	Ukat janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañax wakiskänti.
And he welcomed them.	Ukat jupaw jupanakar katoqäna.
In fact, right now .	Chiqpachansa, jichhax .
Not long after that.	Janiw jaya tiempos uka qhepatjja.
He, at least.	Jupax, mä juk’a.
That’s the only thing that really made sense.	Ukakiw chiqpachapuni amuyasïna.
I really really loved it.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali munasiñampiw uñjta.
I was never really sure.	Janipuniw cheqpachapun sum yatkayätti.
And then he felt better.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He doesn't know exactly why.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw sum yatkiti.
He looked very cautious.	Jupax wali amuyumpiw uñnaqäna.
And then he turned back to me.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, nayaruw kuttʼjjäna.
But he certainly exists.	Ukampis cheqapuniw jupajj utji.
This is not the case, .	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti, .
He definitely said no.	Jupajj cheqapuniw janiw sasaw säna.
Well this is amazing.	Suma akax muspharkañawa.
Do this for two weeks.	Pä semanaw ukham lurañama.
It wasn’t everything.	Janiw taqe kunas utjkänti.
He knew this fact, but he didn't.	Jupajj aka cheq yatïna, ukampis janiw yatkänti.
He was even more afraid.	Jupajj jukʼampiw ajjsaräna.
He didn't say that.	Ukjja janiw jupajj siskänti.
He did not want to know his real name.	Jupajj janiw cheqpach sutip yatiñ munkänti.
I think it’s worth the money.	Nayax amuyta, qullqix wali askiwa.
There were more people there.	Ukanjja, jukʼampiw jaqenakajj utjäna.
I enjoyed the rain here in the winter.	Aka chiqanx juyphi pachanx jallux wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Nothing too deep.	Janiw kunas sinti manqhan utjkiti.
And he didn't want to do that.	Ukat janiw uka jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
He loves golf.	Jupax golf ukarux walpun munasi.
To him, he loved it.	Juparux, jupax wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
He meant it, of course.	Jupax ukham sañ munäna, chiqpachansa.
He didn't do that today.	Jichhürojj janiw ukham lurkänti.
But he can't do anything about it.	Ukampis janiw kunsa uka toqet lurkaspati.
You just can’t believe it.	Jumax janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti.
He didn’t want to work.	Jupax janiw irnaqañ munkänti.
He didn't want to admit it to himself.	Janiw jupa pachpajj uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
But he never wanted to.	Ukampis janipuniw munkänti.
I’ve been there a long time.	Nayax wali jaya pachaw ukan jikxatastxa.
It never lasts very long.	Janipuniw wali jaya tiempox utjkiti.
Let’s take a good look at him.	Jupar sum uñjañäni.
Try to avoid that anyway.	Ukham jan lurañatakejj kunjamatsa chʼamachasiñama.
Individually, of course.	Sapa mayniw, chiqpachansa.
Which is why this is so hard.	Kunatsa akax wali ch’amawa.
That’s exciting isn’t it.	Ukax wali kusiskañawa janicha.
It seemed to work for me.	Nayatakejj wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
He is not sure what to do now.	Jichhajj kunsa lurañapa uk janiw sum yatkiti.
But nothing seemed to work.	Ukampis janiw kunas askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
But, is it worth it? 	Ukampis, ¿walikïskiti?
But it works for me now.	Ukampis jichhajj nayatakejj walikïskiwa.
Very lonely.	Sinti sapaki.
It rains almost every day.	Niya sapa uruw jallux puri.
So I want to say it again.	Ukhamajj wasitatwa arsuñ munta.
English breakfast for me.	Inglés desayuno nayatakix wali askiwa.
It’s a good decision to make.	Ukax mä amtar sum lurañatakiw wakisi.
I didn't think it was very useful.	Janiw wali askïkaspas ukham amuykayätti.
And it happened later.	Ukat qhepatwa ukajj pasäna.
It always wants to come.	Ukax sapa kutiw jutañ munaraki.
It’s always cold.	Sapa kutiw thaya.
I'm not sure how that happens.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw sum yatkti.
He could do it every time.	Jupajj sapa kutiw uk luraspäna.
No adults around.	Janiw jilïr jaqinakax jak’an utjkiti.
It looks like an early winter.	Ukax mä nayrïr juyphi pachan uñtatawa.
There is nothing that I feel helpless.	Janiw kunas utjkiti, jan kuns lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
I just can't do that.	Nayajj janiw ukanak lurirjamäkti.
That’s what he .	Ukaw jupar .
I wasn't too sure where that was going.	Ukajj kawkirus sarañapa uk janiw sinti sum yatkayätti.
But that didn't surprise me.	Ukampis janiw ukajj nayatak muspharkayätti.
Someone had a problem.	Maynix mä jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
He’s a real tough guy.	Jupax chiqpach qhuru jaqiwa.
And ultimately, it’s worth it.	Ukat qhipharux, ukax wali askiwa.
Or he did it himself.	Jan ukajj jupaw ukham luräna.
You understand well, you know.	Jumax sum amuyta, jumax yatisktawa.
That’s important, but it’s important right now.	Ukax wali wakiskiriwa, ukampis jichhax wali wakiskiriwa.
That’s how the weather is.	Ukhamaw pachax utji.
And this is the weirdest thing about it.	Ukat akax uka tuqitx juk’amp muspharkañawa.
I'm alone, I'm alone.	Naya sapakiw, naya sapakiw.
Above all, though .	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukampis .
There is definitely one like that.	Chiqpachansa ukham mayniw utji.
I knew nothing about it.	Nayajj janiw uka toqet kuns yatkayätti.
There is little of that here.	Aka chiqanx ukax juk’akiw utji.
But he said he knew something about the phone.	Ukampis uka telefonot kunsa yattwa sasaw säna.
You really are a big chunk.	Chiqpachansa jumax mä jach’a ch’uqi jaqïtawa.
I don't do what you want me to do.	Nayajj janiw kunjamtï jumajj munkta ukham lurkti.
You can’t do it all in one day.	Janiw mä urux taqi ukanak lurañjamäkiti.
But, not this year.	Ukampis, janiw aka marax ukhamäkiti.
He already knew that.	Jupajj nayraw uk yatïna.
It always has to do itself.	Sapa kutiw jupa pachpa lurañapa.
It’s really fascinating to me.	Chiqpachansa nayatakix wali muspharkañawa.
He learned a language.	Jupajj mä aru yateqäna.
I saw how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk uñjta.
For a time he lived in complete solitude.	Mä tiempojj qʼala sapakiw jakasïna.
Perhaps afterwards.	Inas uka qhepatjja.
The boy looked very sad.	Uka waynax wali llakitaw uñnaqäna.
I’ve seen him there several times.	Nayax juparux walja kutiw ukan uñjta.
I wanted to take what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk apsuñ munta.
He doesn't need anything.	Jupajj janiw kunas munaskiti.
These are somewhat .	Ukanakajj mä jukʼa .
He gave me something for it.	Jupaw ukatakix kuns churitu.
That is never necessary.	Ukajj janipuniw wakiskiti.
He left behind a great deal.	Jupax wali jach’a yänak jaytawayi.
He can't do anything right.	Jupajj janiw kuns sum lurkaspati.
You are now this person.	Jumax jichhax aka jaqiwa.
He got here before me.	Jupajj nayat nayraw aka cheqar purinïna.
It's hard, but it's worth it.	Ukajj chʼamakiwa, ukampis ukajj walikïskiwa.
That looks really cool.	Ukax chiqpachansa wali suma uñtatawa.
You don’t need a new house.	Janiw machaq utax munaskiti.
I want to know both of them.	Panpachaniw uk yatiñ munta.
So he does a wonderful thing.	Ukatwa mä muspharkañ luri.
I went straight to the center.	Nayax chiqaw markarux sarawayta.
No one really knows how long it is.	Chiqpachansa qhawqha tiempos utji uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
And it arrived.	Ukat ukax purinïna.
He reported it to the police.	Jupajj policiaruw uk yatiyäna.
He didn't know exactly.	Jupajj janiw sum yatkayätti.
The process is not suitable for any other purpose.	Uka lurañajj janiw yaqha lurañatakejj askïkiti.
But he seemed to be a nice guy.	Ukampis wali suma jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
And so it is .	Ukat ukhamarakiw .
I think he is fine.	Nayajj jupajj walikïskiwa.
That got him on the spot.	Ukaw uka cheqan katoqäna.
But he loved them so much.	Ukampis jupajj jupanakar wal munasïna.
A good time will be had by all.	Mä suma tiempow taqenis utjani.
The next day he wanted to leave altogether.	Qhipürux taqpach sarxañ munäna.
I went in person this morning.	Jichha alwax jaqiruw sarawayta.
That in a way, would be good.	Ukax mä chiqanx, wali askïspawa.
What did he think he was.	¿Kunsa jupajj amuyäna.
He was a very nice guy.	Jupajj wali sumaw sarnaqäna.
No, that was probably the case.	Janiwa, ukajj inas ukhamänwa.
There will be no problem with that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
I understand what he is saying.	Nayajj kuntï siski uk sum amuyta.
But he, yeah, he knew.	Ukampis jupax, jïsa, jupax yatïna.
Interestingly, that’s what both of them understood the most.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa, ukax panpachaniw juk’amp amuyasïna.
He sees it as such.	Jupajj ukhamwa uñji.
He said all of them.	Jupajj taqeniw ukham säna.
And that’s not what I like.	Ukat ukax janiw nayatakix askïkiti.
Thank you so much, they are awesome!.	Walpun yuspärta, jupanakax wali muspharkañawa!.
Well, except for one thing.	Ukhama, jan ukasti mä kuna.
You decided everything.	Jumaw taqe kun amtawayta.
If anything happens to him .	Jupar kunas pasaspa ukhajja .
I don't need to do that now.	Jichhajj janiw ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
He didn’t want a ride.	Jupax janiw mä autot sarañ munkänti.
That’s an amazing power.	Ukax mä muspharkañ ch’amawa.
I understand you are a very nice person.	Nayax amuyasta jumax wali suma jaqiwa.
He couldn't swallow it.	Jupajj janiw uk manqʼañ puedkänti.
Time is of the essence here.	Aka chiqanx tiempox wali wakiskiriwa.
I don't know how to talk about him.	Janiw nayajj kunjamsa jupat parlañ yatkti.
It was a beautiful, beautiful day.	Uka urux wali sumapunïnwa, wali sumapunïnwa.
But he knew it wasn't.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I wanted to leave and he wanted to stay.	Nayax sarxañ munta ukat jupax qhiparañ munäna.
You know what someone thinks.	Maynix kunsa amuyi uk jumax yatisktawa.
But no, not those people.	Ukampis janiw, janiw uka jaqenakajj utjkiti.
And then he said something really weird.	Ukat ukat chiqpachansa muspharkañ arunak arsüna.
You have to be willing to do it.	Uk lurañatakejj taqe chuymaw chʼamachasiñama.
But I’m worried.	Ukampis nayax llakistwa.
He knows better than that.	Jupajj uka toqetwa jukʼamp sum yati.
That’s what’s happening.	Ukax kunas pasaski.
He advised her as follows.	Jupajj akham sasaw ewjjtʼäna.
No one wanted to talk to you.	Janiw khitis jumamp parlañ munkänti.
There was no one to go far.	Janiw khitis jaya sarañatak utjkänti.
I’ll go a little better.	Nayax mä juk’amp sum sarä.
In this case, and .	Uka tuqitxa, ukat .
Mine too, for that matter.	Nayan ukhamaraki, uka tuqitxa.
There are two things that are a bit unusual.	Pä kunaw utji, ukax mä juk’a jan uñt’atawa.
The only thing wrong with him.	Jupan jan walïki ukakiw utji.
He has her now.	Jupajj jichhajj jupampiw utji.
And he sees them.	Ukat jupanakar uñji.
Of course, we will do more than that.	Chiqansa, ukat sipansa jukʼampiw lurañäni.
How can he do that.	Kunjamsa jupajj uk luraspa.
He walked before me.	Jupajj nayat nayraw sarnaqäna.
He does it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uk luri.
I want to know a lot.	Yatiñ walpun munta.
But he did it wholeheartedly.	Ukampis taqe chuymaw uk luräna.
And when he was amazing.	Ukat kunapachatï jupajj muspharkañ lurkäna ukhajja.
Let me know how it goes for you.	Kunjamsa jumatakix saraski uk yatiyapxita.
He knew what he wanted now.	Kuntï munkäna uk jichhajj sum yatïna.
There’s a whole new world.	Ukanx mä machaq pachaw utji.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Janiw kuna lurañsa munkayätti.
In fact, it may be worth doing.	Chiqansa, inas uka lurañax wakischispa.
Here’s how to go about doing that.	Akax kunjams uka lurañatakix sarañapa.
You don't want to eat.	Janiw manqʼañ munktati.
He called her another time.	Jupajj yaqha kutiw jawsäna.
But nowadays, it is very difficult.	Ukampis jichha tiemponjja, wali chʼamakiwa.
He said he loved it.	Jupajj walpun munta sasaw säna.
An amazing gift.	Mä muspharkañ regalo.

But something was wrong with this phone.	Ukampis kuna jan waltʼäwis aka telefonot utjäna.
He didn't want to, but he wanted to.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, jan ukasti jupaw munäna.
So far I like everything about it.	Jichhakamax nayax taqi kunas uka tuqitx wali askiwa.

But it was good, it was good.	Ukampis wali sumapunïnwa, wali sumapunïnwa.

But he tried to do it himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw ukham lurañatak chʼamachasïna.
The taxi drives with him.	Taxi ukax jupamp chikaw sarnaqaski.

He was as bad as he did things.	Jupajj kunjamtï kuns lurkäna ukham jan wali jaqënwa.
He asked some important questions.	Jupajj mä qhawqha wakiskir jisktʼanak jisktʼäna.
He didn't like it all that much.	Jupajj janiw ukanak taqe kunsa gustkänti.
Therefore, the target puri.	Ukatwa, uka amtar puri.
He wanted to see inside.	Jupax manqhan uñjañ munäna.

In fact, he thinks he made the right decision.	Chiqansa, jupax sum amtawayi sasaw amuyi.
And he has a lot more time to go.	Ukat jupax jukʼamp walja tiempow sarañapa.
Nothing was like that again.	Janiw kunas mayamps ukham utjkänti.

I thought he handled this really well.	Chiqpachansa aka tuqitxa wali sum apnaqi sasaw amuyayäta.
But he didn't seem to want to do that.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañ munkaspa ukham amuyaskänti.
I think the school is good.	Nayax yatiqañ utax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
Now everything is very clear.	Jichhax taqi kunas wali qhanawa.
And here’s why.	Ukat akax kunatsa.
The time came quickly.	Uka tiempojj jankʼakiw purinïna.
I think it was.	Ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
Wherever he belongs.	Kawkhantï jupajj utjki ukanjja.
In an unknown location.	Mä jan uñt’at chiqan.
No one wants him today.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw khitis jupar munkiti.
Never more, more than once.	Janipuniw juk’ampi, mä kuti juk’ampi.
I really admire him.	Chiqpachansa juparux wali sum uñjta.
There is nothing to help.	Janiw kunas yanaptʼañatakejj utjkiti.
But that doesn't appeal to anyone.	Ukampis ukajj janiw khitirus munaskiti.
Your most amazing and beautiful.	Juman juk’ampi muspharkañ ukat suma.
And that, obviously, doesn’t work for me.	Ukat ukax, qhanaw, janiw nayatakix irnaqkiti.
Then he saw something.	Ukat mä kuns uñjäna.
Long, very long.	Jaya, wali jaya.
It was as clear as can be.	Ukajj kunjamtï lurañjamäki ukham qhanaw jikjjatasïna.
Not anymore, not now.	Janiw juk’ampi, janiw jichhax.
He’s never done this before.	Jupax janipuniw nayrax ukham lurkänti.
It’s really nice!.	¡Chiqpachansa wali sumawa!.
He wanted it more than anything else.	Taqi kunat sipansa jukʼampiw munäna.
A good guy does that.	Mä suma jaqejj uk luri.
That lasted about a year.	Ukajj niya mä maraw utjäna.
He does that to everybody, you know.	Jupax taqiniruw ukham luri, jumax yatisktawa.
You know how big they are.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams jach’a jupanakax ukxa.
I couldn’t wait to see them again.	Janiw mayamp jupanakar uñjañ suykayätti.
No one has it all.	Janiw khitis taqe ukanak utjkiti.
I don’t know about these things.	Janiw nayax ukanak yatkti.
He wanted to know everything.	Jupajj taqe kunwa yatiñ munäna.
It looks a little rough.	Ukax mä juk’a qhuru uñtatawa.
He did well there.	Ukanjja, jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
People can't do it.	Jaqenakajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
You're a great guy.	Jumax mä jach'a jaqiwa.
Both are expensive of course but not too bad.	Panpachaniw qullqix chiqpachansa ukampis janiw sinti jan walïkiti.
He refused to go to bed.	Jupajj janiw ikiñar sarañ munkänti.
He worked very hard.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw irnaqäna.
He was just here, that’s all.	Jupax akanx jichhakiw jikxatasïna, ukakiw utjäna.
He cannot stay much longer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp tiempojj utjkaspati.
But before that .	Ukampis janïr uka tiemponjja .
But something is very wrong.	Ukampis kunas wali jan walïkiti.
She died before him.	Jupat nayraw jiwjjäna.
I’ve definitely done it.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw uk lurawayta.
So it’s really exciting about that.	Ukhamajj uka tuqitxa chiqpachansa wali kusiskañawa.
I made them better.	Nayaw jupanakar jukʼamp sum lurawayta.
He was nowhere to be found.	Jupax janiw kawkhans utjkänti.
And he thought he was very grateful.	Ukat jupajj wal yuspärta sasaw amuyäna.
I really hope not.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw suytʼaskta.
Which I don’t think is right.	Ukax nayax janiw walïkiti sasaw amuyta.
That’s how things were.	Ukhamaw kunanakas utjäna.
So it used to be.	Ukhamajj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
No one knows how long that might last.	Ukajj qhawqha tiempos utjaspa uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
Just started making them.	Jichhakiw jupanakar lurañ qalltäna.
There is plenty of time to do so.	Ukham lurañatakix walja tiempow utji.
It’s going very fast.	Wali jank’akiw saraski.
Where do you know	Kawkitsa uk yatta .
I like it though, you like it.	Nayax wali askiwa ukampis, jumax wali askiwa.
So it doesn't really mean anything.	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns sañ munkiti.
Like it wasn’t happening.	Kunjamtï jan luraskäna ukhama.
Just what you said.	Kuntï jumax siskta ukhamakiw.
I don't want that to happen to you.	Nayajj janiw jumajj ukham pasañap munktati.
He wanted money from her.	Jupat qollqe munäna.
This made him even more afraid.	Ukajj jukʼampiw ajjsaräna.
Of course, he wanted more light.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼamp qhanaw munasïna.
And the bad guy will do more harm than good.	Ukat jan wali jaqix askit sipansa jukʼamp jan walinak lurani.
This can take hours .	Ukatakejj walja horanakaw munasispa .
I always think of you.	Nayax sapa kutiw jumar amuyta.

She says she wants to talk to you.	Ukat jumamp parltʼañ munta sasaw saraki.
And, yes, he was.	Ukat, jïsa, jupax ukhamänwa.
Now it’s back to me.	Jichhax nayaruw wasitat purini.
Every room in the house to make the.	Uta manqhan sapa cuarto lurañatakix uka...
No one is riding anywhere tonight.	Jichha arumax janiw khitis kawkirus kayuk sarkiti.
That was what was needed now.	Ukaw jichhajj wakisïna.
So it’s good for you.	Ukhamajj jumatakejj wali askiwa.
Now this opportunity is available to all of us.	Jichhax aka oportunidad ukax taqiniruw purini.
I don’t know, maybe something like that happens.	Janiw yatkti, inas ukham kunas pasaspa.
So he went away on his own.	Ukatwa jupa pachpa sarjjäna.
These are separate.	Ukanakajj sapa mayniw utji.
I hope I have a long life.	Nayax wali jaya jakañ suyt’askta.
In fact, there is often very little.	Chiqansa, walja kutix jukʼakiw utji.
I have no idea why not.	Kunatsa jan ukajj uk janiw amuykti.
He does not rush things.	Jupajj janiw kunsa jankʼak lurkiti.
He lived by the power of language.	Jupax aru ch’amampiw jakasïna.
Great distance	Jach'a jaya .
I really didn't want to talk.	Chiqpachansa janiw parltʼañ munkayätti.
It’s almost winter.	Niyaw juyphi pachax purini.
They don't like the way he uses it.	Jupajj kunjamsa apnaqi uk janiw jupanakajj gustkiti.
I have always done that for me.	Nayatakejj nayratpachaw ukanak lurawayta.
Therefore, he died.	Ukatwa jiwjjäna.
I never wanted one.	Janipuniw mä jukʼa munkayätti.
I don’t really want to do that.	Janiw chiqpachansa ukham lurañ munkti.
If something happens to me .	Kunas nayarojj pasaspa ukhajja .
We will do this in the future.	Ukjja, jutïrin lurañäni.
Well everything was excellent.	Wali taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
There was no future.	Jutïr tiempojj janiw utjkänti.
And he didn't understand it.	Ukat janiw uk amuykänti.
And he really loved her.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw juparux wal munasïna.

He’s a great little guy.	Jupax wali jach’a jisk’a jaqiwa.
No, that came later.	Janiwa, ukajj qhepatwa jutäna.

I always feel the need to improve and improve.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp sum lurañasa ukat jukʼamp sum lurañasa wakisi sasaw amuyasta.
That, and that’s all.	Ukax, ukat ukakiw.
That would be good as well.	Ukax wali askïspawa ukhamaraki.
He said he didn’t know what exactly he would do.	Kunsa chiqpachapuni lurani ukxa janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
It’s still a popular one by now.	Ukax jichhakamax wali uñt’atawa.
And no, it’s not impossible.	Ukat janiw, janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
He doesn’t want to, he said.	Jupax janiw munkiti, sasaw säna.
Almost a new kind of person.	Niya machaq kasta jaqiwa.
In fact, we are nothing.	Chiqpachansa, jiwasax janiw kunäkisa.

Almost the first night last day.	Niya nayrïr arumax qhipa uru.
Or, in my case, a bad guy.	Jan ukax, nayatakix, jan wali jaqiwa.
It will be a new world .	Mä machaq pachaw utjani .
But not many people know that.	Ukampis janiw walja jaqenakajj uk yatipkiti.
The first man spoke to him.	Nayrïr jaqix jupampiw parläna.
So either .	Ukhamajj jan ukajj .
Three years, less.	Kimsa mara, juk’ampi.
He had no reason to be there.	Jupajj janiw kuna razonas ukan utjkänti.
Because now .	Kunatix jichhax .
He just did that.	Jupax ukhamakiw ukham luratayna.
Good almost there.	Suma niya kuna.
A single book.	Mä sapa libro.
I still feel strongly about this country.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw aka markat jikxatastxa.

At the time, I thought that was funny.	Uka tiemponjja, ukajj wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Should do it a little faster.	Mä juk’a jank’akiw lurañapa.
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Janiw khitirus kunäkisa.
You come here on your own.	Jumax juma pachpaw akan jutta.
I didn’t really want to do anything bad to him.	Janiw chiqpachapunix jupar kuna jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.
That doesn't matter to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj janiw wakiskiti.
He did time in jail.	Jupax carcelan tiempo luratayna.
He came with love.	Jupajj munasiñampiw jutäna.
It really isn’t anything like that.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas ukhamäkiti.
That didn't mean .	Ukajj janiw sañ munkänti .
I don't mean to say that.	Janiw nayajj ukham sañ munkti.
Everyone has a moment.	Taqiniruw mä juk’a pachax utji.
He’s human again.	Jupax wasitat jaqiwa.
It’s much more difficult.	Ukax juk’ampi ch’amawa.
She doesn't want to leave him.	Jupajj janiw jupar jaytañ munkiti.
He couldn't sleep on his own.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj ikiñ puedkänti.
But I refuse to agree with that.	Ukampis nayajj janiw uka toqet iyaw sañ munkti.
Blood this time.	Wila aka kutix.
It’s a very big one.	Ukax wali jach’a.
No, I don't think so.	Janiwa, nayajj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Always, always like that.	Sapa kuti, sapa kuti ukhama.
No one knows exactly what happened.	Kunas pasäna uk janiw khitis sum yatkiti.
Yeah, you can do whatever you want.	Jïsa, kuntï munkta uk lurasma.
This time it’s faster.	Aka kutix juk’amp jank’akiw.
He knew he didn't mean it.	Jupajj janiw uk sañ munkänti, uk sum yatïna.
What you say is impossible.	Kuntï siskta ukajj janiw lurañjamäkiti.
He hoped there would be no two.	Jupajj janiw pä jaqejj utjkaniti sasaw suyäna.
I wanted to know all this stuff and do it all.	Taqi ukanak yatxatañ munta ukat taqi ukanak lurañ munta.
But one day you will feel better.	Ukampis mä urux wali sumwa jikxatasïta.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Jupajj kunsa sañ munäna uk sum yatïna.
Everything happened without me.	Taqe kunas jan nayamp chikaw pasäna.
Long too short too late.	Jaya sinti jisk’a wali qhipa.
He wanted it all.	Jupajj taqe ukanak munäna.
I didn’t want it all.	Janiw taqpach munkayätti.
Now he says he is.	Jichhax jupax siwa.
What you have done in the past does not matter.	Kuntï nayrajj lurapkta ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
That’s what I do.	Ukax kuntix nayax lurkta.
So it’s not impossible.	Ukhamajj janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
It’s almost time to get there.	Niya pacharuw purini.
In fact, he was a bit of both.	Chiqansa, jupax mä jukʼa panpachaniw jikxatasïna.
I’m sorry without that.	Nayax jan uka tuqitx llakistwa.
I don’t want to come through.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit jutañ munkti.
It’s already doing it.	Ukax niyaw luraski.
In this case you really shouldn’t do it.	Uka tuqitxa chiqpachansa janiw lurañamäkiti.
I’m the smallest person.	Nayax juk’amp jisk’a jaqïtwa.
This time it would be good.	Aka kutix wali askïspawa.
He was sad and a little sad.	Jupajj llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat mä jukʼa llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
But you’re still a good guy.	Ukampis jumax wali suma jaqïtawa.
He thought it was pretty bad.	Jupax wali jan waliw sasaw amuyäna.
He said something.	Jupax kuns arsüna.
Let’s see him again.	Jupar wasitat uñjañäni.
Always always.	Sapa kutiw sapa kuti.
He can do just about anything.	Jupajj niyaw taqe kunsa luraspa.
When he didn’t.	Kunapachatï jupax jan ukham lurkäna ukhaxa.
But he knew his name.	Ukampis jupajj sutip sum yatïna.
He said no more than that.	Ukat sipansa jukʼampiw janiw siskänti.
He didn't want to see what would happen next.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk janiw uñjañ munkänti.
Yes, you are right.	Jïsa, jumajj walikïskiwa.
I never saw the game.	Janipuniw uka anattʼañ uñjkti.

This marked the beginning of a new era.	Ukaw mä machaq tiempon qalltäna.

That didn't seem like a good idea to me.	Ukajj janiw nayatakejj wali askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
I understood what he meant.	Kuntï sañ munkäna uk sum amuyayäta.
There was no way to do that.	Janiw ukham lurañax utjkänti.
It takes no more time for that.	Ukatakejj janiw kuna tiempos jukʼamp munaskiti.
I have never seen anything so horrible.	Janipuniw ukham sinti jan walinak uñjkti.
He rode quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw kayuk saräna.
Tomorrow, he’d do something.	Qhipürux, jupax kuns luraspänwa.
He needs that from me.	Jupajj nayat ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Nothing felt special.	Janiw kunas wali askïkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
That was a good thing, it turned out.	Ukajj wali sumapunïnwa, sasaw amuyasïna.
He had no idea what was wrong.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna uk janiw amuykänti.
Worst of all, he was right.	Ukat jukʼamp jan walïki ukajja, jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
Good beer too.	Suma cerveza ukhamaraki.
I think anyone can do it.	Nayax amuyta khitis uk luraspawa.
He will have everything soon.	Jupajj jankʼakiw taqe kunsa utjani.
Who do you see? 	¿Khitirus uñjta?
But, no, it wasn’t.	Ukampis, janiwa, janiw ukhamäkänti.
It really did that for me.	Chiqpachansa, nayatakix ukham lurawayi.
A quiet night.	Mä llamp’u arumax.
He was surprised to see it.	Uk uñjasajj wal muspharäna.
These are also .	Ukanakax ukhamarakiw .
Or that’s pretty cool.	Jan ukax ukax wali sumawa.
I started on it today.	Jichhüruw uka tuqit qalltawayta.
It’s clear that it really isn’t.	Chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti, ukax qhanawa.
That’s better than me, too.	Ukax nayat sipan juk’amp sumawa, ukhamaraki.
There is a lot of fun in doing so.	Ukham lurasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasi.
I could do it night after night.	Nayajj arumaw arumaw uk luraspäna.
If there is a future.	Jutïr pachax utjani ukhaxa.
I could understand how surprised he was.	Kunjamsa jupax muspharäna uk sum amuyayäta.
I knew what to expect, of course.	Kuntï suykayäta uk sum yatiyäta, chiqpachansa.
But so far nothing has worked.	Ukampis jichhakamax janiw kunas irnaqkiti.
But there is little you can do.	Ukampis kuntï lurañjamäki ukajj jukʼakiw utji.
He is a man of conversation.	Jupajj parlir jaqewa.
So you need to do something wrong with me.	Ukhamajj nayat jan walinak lurañaw wakisi.
That is completely wrong.	Ukajj qʼala jan walikïskiwa.
I’ve had both.	Nayax panpachaniw jikxatasiyäta.
I feel better about myself.	Naya pachpaw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasta.
He thought that was unnecessary.	Ukajj janiw wakiskiti sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
It was a great night.	Mä jach’a arumaw utjäna.
But all of this took time.	Ukampis taqe ukanakajj tiempow munasïna.
He loves it that much.	Jupajj ukham wal munasi.
It’s big and intense.	Jach’a ukat wali ch’amawa.
I think that’s good for you.	Nayax amuyta ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
But it does it very well.	Ukampis wali sumwa uk luri.
He would, anyhow, do what she said.	Jupajj kunjamatsa, kuntï jupajj siskäna uk luraspänwa.
He’s obviously a good performer.	Jupax qhanaw mä suma lurir jaqiwa.
That's what he said.	Ukhamwa jupajj säna.
Definitely beyond me.	Chiqpachansa nayat sipansa.
This is the first day here.	Akax nayrïr uruw akan utji.
The school is the school.	Yatiqañ uta yatiqañ uta.
He seemed to know everything about every aspect.	Jupajj sapa toqet taqe kunsa yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
He said it didn’t matter.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti sasaw säna.
I had a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it.	Nayax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta ukat chiqpachans wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Or, maybe, three.	Jan ukax, inas, kimsa.
But I asked them to.	Ukampis nayaw jupanakar mayïna.
Which is something you don’t see often.	Kuna kunatï jan sapa kuti uñjkta ukawa.
He called home today.	Jichhüruw utar jawsäna.
There was so much silence that no one said anything.	Ukanx wali amukiw utjäna, janiw khitis kuns arskänti.
Or me, for that matter.	Jan ukax naya, uka tuqitxa.
He knows what to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa sum yati.
And, as with everything you do, you’re good at it.	Ukat, kunjamtï taqi kun lurapkta ukhama, jumax wali sum lurañ yatta.
The issue is how you perceive the situation.	Uka jan waltʼäwejj kunjamsa uka jan waltʼäwit amuyasta ukawa.
I'm very clear.	Nayajj wali qhanawa.
Everyone needs to do that.	Sapa mayniw ukham lurañax wakisi.
That would have done something.	Ukaw kuns luraspäna.
I knew how bad it could be.	Kunjamsa jan walinak luraspa uk sum yatiyäta.
This is often wrong.	Ukajj walja kutiw jan walïkiti.
I happily agreed.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw iyaw sista.
He wasn't sure what the problem was.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utjäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
He was doing it himself.	Jupa pachpaw luraskäna.
Definitely no one today.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis jichhürunakanxa.
I want to use it myself.	Naya pachpaw ukanak apnaqañ munta.
But you have to do it.	Ukampis jumaw uk lurañama.
In all honesty, not at all.	Taqi chiqansa, janiw kunjamatsa.
But that doesn't really matter.	Ukampis ukajj janiw cheqpachapun wakiskiti.
I thought it was okay.	Nayax walikïskiwa sasaw amuyayäta.
I think it will take a week.	Nayax amuyta, mä semanaw wakisispa.
How he used to see them.	Kunjamsa nayrajj jupanakar uñjäna.
I mean with that attitude.	Nayax uka amuyumpiw sañ munta.
I don’t want to be like that.	Janiw nayax ukham sarnaqañ munkti.
Of course he’s known.	Chiqansa jupax uñt’atawa.
Here’s a little .	Akax mä juk’a .
That’s not right, that’s not right.	Ukax janiw walïkiti, ukax janiw walïkiti.
I think we should do both.	Nayax amuyta, panpachaniw lurañasa.
It’s been a year now.	Mä maraw jichhax.
Lunch looks great.	Chika uru manq’añax wali suma uñtatawa.
There was nothing to do in the morning.	Alwajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkänti.
The cost will be minimal.	Uka qullqix juk’akiw utjani.
We’ll see what time it is.	Kuna horasas uk uñjañäni.
Not everything is good for me.	Janiw nayatakejj taqe kunas walïkiti.
But before that time.	Ukampis janïr uka tiemponjja.
But it does something for me.	Ukampis nayatakix kuns luraski.
I think you’ll love it.	Nayax jumax munasiñampiw jikxatasïta sasaw amuyta.
There is nothing here about that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas akan utjkiti.
You are right about that.	Jumax chiqaw uka tuqitxa.
Very exciting, of course.	Wali kusiskañawa, chiqansa.
But we cannot agree with that.	Ukampis jiwasajj janiw uka toqet iyaw sañjamäkiti.
It was doing it big time.	Ukajj wali jachʼa tiempo luraskäna.
That's how he started.	Ukhamaw jupajj qalltäna.
She loved it and loved it with all her heart.	Jupajj wal munasïna ukat taqe chuymaw munasïna.
I don't know ten.	Janiw tunka uñt'kti.
You may need to do this later.	Inas qhepat uk lurañajj wakischispa.
He did not know what would happen next.	Jupajj kunas qhepat pasani uk janiw yatkänti.
There is never anything.	Janipuniw kunas utjkiti.
It’s amazing so far.	Jichhakamax muspharkañawa.
There’s really nothing that bad about it.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukham jan wali lurañax utjkiti.
He knew how, but he couldn't do it.	Kunjamsa uk sum yatïna, ukampis janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.
I’m really enjoying the moment.	Chiqpachansa uka pachax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
They are not necessary.	Jupanakajj janiw wakiskiti.
That’s what he saw.	Ukaw jupar uñjäna.
I can't think of two.	Janiw pä tuqit amuytʼirjamäkti.
You had no idea what he was planning.	Jumajj janiw kuntï jupajj amtkäna uk yatkayätati.
Because it doesn’t really work.	Kunatix janiw chiqpachans irnaqkiti.
Then he called again.	Ukat wasitat jawsäna.
This happened a long time ago.	Ukax nayratpachaw pasäna.
No, it’s really good.	Janiwa, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
You know, people are amazing.	Jumax yatisktawa, jaqinakax muspharkañawa.
Except, things are very quiet.	Jan ukasti, kunanakas wali amukiw utji.
Extremely warm and comfortable.	Sinti junt’u ukat suma.
But he never did anything wrong about it.	Ukampis janipuniw uka toqet jan walinak lurkänti.
I didn’t do that to anyone.	Nayax janiw khitirus ukham lurkänti.
He said he didn't know about it.	Jupajj janiw ukanak yatkti sasaw säna.
And he said he didn’t know.	Ukat jupax janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
He was being rude about it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa jan walinak luraskäna.
They know a tremendous amount.	Jupanakax mä jach’a qullqi yatipxi.
I promise it with all my heart.	Taqi chuymaw arsuwayta.
I’m pretty excited about this.	Nayax aka tuqitx wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
Because money needs to be made.	Kunatix qullqix lurañaw wakisi.
I'm not sure what to do	Nayax ukat .
It would be a good idea to do so.	Ukham lurañax wali askïspawa.
But he didn't understand anything.	Ukampis janiw kunas uk amuykänti.
Maybe that would make a good film.	Inas ukax mä suma película luraspa.
She looked so happy to see him.	Jupar uñjasajj wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
That’s a big part of this, too.	Ukax mä jach’a chiqaw aka tuqitxa, ukhamaraki.
But when you get there .	Ukampis uka cheqar purisajj .
He decided to give up life.	Jupaw jakañ jaytañ amtäna.
Let’s do these things.	Uka lurañanak lurañäni.
And she couldn't talk to anyone about what had happened before.	Ukat janiw khitirus nayrajj paskäna uka toqet parlañ puedkänti.
There is nothing worse, just more.	Janiw jukʼamp jan wali lurañajj utjkiti, jan ukasti jukʼampiw utji.
It’s doing everything.	Taqi kunwa luraski.
Well it was next to go.	Sumaw jutïr sarañatak utjäna.
This is a very small snowflake.	Akax wali jisk’a ch’uqi satawa.
I like them all, actually.	Nayax taqiniruw gustitu, chiqpachansa.
I’m almost in the morning.	Niya alwaw purini.
After all I am.	Taqi kunat sipansa nayax.
He’s such a celebrity here.	Jupax akanx ukham wali uñt’atawa.
Not so now, of course.	Jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
There is a light somewhere.	Mä qhanaw kawkhans utji.
It’s going nice and smooth.	Ukax suma ukat suma saraski.
I look forward to that again.	Ukajj wasitatwa suytʼaskta.
But, there is one downside.	Ukampis, mä jan waliw utji.
It was wrong for me.	Nayatakix jan waliw utjäna.
Who and when you can do that.	Khitis ukat kunapachas ukham lurañjamäki.
I very rarely say that.	Nayax wali juk’akiw ukham sista.
They know a bit about flying, too.	Jupanakax avión tuqit mä juk’a yatipxi, ukhamaraki.
Would definitely enjoy going there.	Chiqpachansa uka chiqar sarañax wali askïspawa.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ukampis janiw munkiti.
In fact, it feels a little like that again.	Chiqansa, wasitatwa mä jukʼa ukham jikxatasi.
So I didn't want all of that to happen.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak taqe kunas pasañap munkayätti.
Like something that actually happened.	Kunjamtï mä kunatï cheqpachapun paskäna ukhama.
He was surprised by it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal muspharta.
I love them myself.	Naya pachpaw jupanakar wal munasta.
He left work to go with me.	Jupajj nayamp chik sarañatakiw irnaqäwipat sarjjäna.
He could have just done it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraspäna.
He would never do it again.	Janipuniw mayampsa uk lurkaspänti.
And all you can do is nothing.	Ukat taqe kunatï lurañjamäki ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
And one thing.	Ukat mä kuna.
He knew that very well.	Jupaw uk sum yatïna.
It wasn’t, it never was.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
I want everyone there.	Nayax taqiniruw ukan munta.
And all that wine.	Ukat taqi uka vino.
And then he was devastated.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
You don’t really know.	Jumax janiw chiqpachapunix yatkayätati.
It was completely outrageous.	Ukajj qʼala jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
It’s kind of hard to find anywhere.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amaw kawkhans jikxatasi.
And I love making coffee.	Ukat café lurañsa wal gustitu.
Its location is unknown.	Ukax kawkhans jikxatasi ukx jan uñt’atawa.
He wanted to know the truth.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk yatiñ wal munäna.
I don't know what to do	Nayajj janiw yatkti .
It’s been around for many years.	Walja maranakaw utjawayi.
But he understood why he did it.	Ukampis kunatsa ukham luräna uk jupajj sum amuyäna.
Instead he called the police.	Jan ukasti policiaruw jawsäna.
I don't know exactly when that happened.	Kunapachas ukajj pasäna uk janiw sum yatkti.
It’s a fairly recent discovery.	Ukax mä juk’a jichhakiw jikxatasi.
Everything else.	Taqi kunas.
And no one ever will.	Ukat janiw khitis janipuniw ukham lurkaniti.
He’s the one who does things.	Jupaw kuns luri.
And maybe yes.	Ukat inas jïsa.
She immediately went to the next one and made the phone call.	Ukat jankʼakiw jutïr ukar saräna ukat telefonot jawsäna.
But we have this world.	Ukampis aka pachaw utjistu.
That’s good and worth it, and it’s okay.	Ukax wali askiwa ukat wali askiwa, ukat walikïskiwa.
He never said otherwise.	Jupajj janipuniw yaqha ukham siskänti.
You feel the same way.	Jumax ukhamarakiw amuyasta.
He hasn't gone for it yet though.	Jupax janiw ukatakix jichhakamax sarkiti ukampis.
It’s very harsh about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali qhuru.
So we’re going to do that.	Ukhamajj jiwasajj ukham lurañäni.
And it was very important.	Ukat wali wakiskiriwa.
I want to know how he did it, and why.	Kunjamsa uk luräna, ukat kunatsa uk yatiñ munta.
The guy can do well.	Uka waynax sum luraspa.
Which, speaks for itself.	Ukax, jupa pachpaw arsu.
Recently when it gets bad.	Jichhakiw kunapachatï jan walin uñjasi.
So am I. I’m not.	Ukhamarakiw nayax.
You need to do more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp lurañamawa.
So you know what’s going to happen to him.	Ukhamajj kunas jupar pasani uk jumajj yatisktawa.
It’s very, very hard to do that.	Ukham lurañax wali, wali ch’amawa.
It’s been a little bit difficult.	Ukax mä juk’a ch’amaw utjawayi.
This is good for two reasons.	Ukax pä tuqit wali askiwa.
Later, he died as a result.	Qhepatjja, ukatwa jiwjjäna.
And maybe you don't know.	Ukat inas jumajj jan yatkchiti.
That's the best thing.	Ukaw wali askejja.
But he didn't think it looked out of place.	Ukampis janiw jan cheqan uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuykänti.
He loved it there.	Jupajj ukan wal munasïna.
Nothing can happen.	Janiw kunas pasaspa.
It’s also good for me in terms of learning.	Ukhamarakiw nayatakix wali askiwa yatiqañ tuqitxa.
And this time it is not.	Ukat aka tiempox janiw ukhamäkiti.
About what that could mean.	Kuntï ukajj sañ munkaspa uka toqetwa.
It’s like Nayar.	Nayar uñtatawa.
That was a yes.	Ukajj mä jïsa ukhamänwa.
It’s time to take it back.	Ukax wasitat apsuñ pachaw purini.
Both need to be done.	Panpachaniw lurañax wakisi.
I don’t want a gift.	Janiw mä regalo munkti.
If you do, there will be no problem.	Ukham lurasma ukhajja, janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti.
Doing so does not benefit individually.	Ukham lurasax janiw sapa maynix askïkiti.
He said he hadn't seen her in a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempojj janiw uñjkti sasaw säna.
I see this and that.	Nayax aka ukat uka uñjta.
One or two things are needed.	Mä jan ukajj pä kunaw wakisi.
I pretty much told him that.	Nayajj niyaw jupar ukham sista.
He was quick and sincere.	Jupajj jankʼakiw ukat taqe chuymaw parläna.
I think, every day.	Nayax amuyta, sapa uru.
All of these are well worth the money.	Taqi ukanakax qullqix wali askiwa.
I think that speaks for itself.	Nayax amuyta ukax jupa pachpaw arsu.
He died afterwards.	Jupajj uka qhepatwa jiwjjäna.
Bad, but still.	Jan wali, ukampis wali.
But I am right.	Ukampis nayajj cheqapuniw sista.
But that was not the place to go.	Ukampis ukajj janiw sarañatak utjkänti.
I didn't understand him.	Nayajj jupar janiw sum amuykayätti.
And why not, of course.	Ukat kunatsa jan ukhamäki, chiqpachansa.
The question is what to do now.	Jisktʼajj kunsa jichhajj lurañasa.
And if you want to get involved, let me know.	Ukat jumatix ukar mantañ munsta ukhax yatiyapxita.
Let's take a look at what we have.	Kunanakas utjistu uk mä jukʼa uñjañäni.
The best thing to do is to do both.	Ukax wali askiwa, panpachaniw lurañama.
He had been for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukham sarnaqäna.
Maybe that’s all he really wants.	Inas ukakiw chiqpachapuni munki.
I think this is obvious.	Nayax amuyta akax qhanawa.
That’s the biggest reason.	Uka jach’a kunatsa.
He said he didn't want them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar munkti sasaw säna.
It was as if no one knew where to go.	Janis khitis kawkirus sarañapa uk yatkaspa ukhamänwa.
It was a quiet thing to do.	Ukax mä amukiw lurañax utjäna.
When you can do something and get it done, it's beautiful.	Kunapachatï kuns lurasma ukat ukanak lurasma ukhajja, wali sumawa.
I felt very comfortable.	Nayax wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
So why should he go?' 	Ukhamajj ¿kunatsa sarañapa?’ sasa.
He didn't say anywhere.	Jupajj janiw kawkhansa siskänti.
And it feels really lonely.	Ukat chiqpachansa sapakiw jikxatasi.
So I started heading home.	Ukhamaw utar sarañ qalltawayta.
I think he would be interesting.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali askïspawa.
How do we do it ourselves.	Kunjamatsa jiwasax lurañasa.
You can’t do it yourself.	Janiw juma pachpa lurañjamäkiti.
That was the start of that.	Ukaw uka qalltäna.
I’m always with someone, really.	Nayax sapa kutiw khitimpis jikxatastxa, chiqpachansa.
I don’t know what time it is, it doesn’t matter.	Janiw kuna horasas uk yatkti, janiw kuns lurkiti.
Don't forget today.	Jichhürunakanjja, jan armasimti.
He’s really had a hard time that year.	Jupax chiqpachansa uka marax wali ch’amampiw jikxatasïna.
I hope otherwise.	Nayax suyt’twa yaqha tuqitxa.
But he was very quiet.	Ukampis jupax wali amukiw jikxatasïna.
Of course, it will last longer.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp tiempow ukax utjani.
A little longer.	Mä juk’amp jaya.
He didn't know how he knew it, but he knew it.	Kunjamsa uk yatïna uk janiw yatkänti, ukampis uk yatïna.
Clearly this doesn’t work.	Qhanaw akax janiw irnaqkiti.
They are very clear about it.	Jupanakax wali qhanaw uka tuqitxa.
Or maybe yes.	Jan ukajj inas jïsa.
The man died immediately.	Uka jaqejj jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
I have no idea where he could be.	Kawkhansa jupajj utjaspa uk janiw amuykti.
That’s rare for anyone.	Ukax khitirus juk’akiw utji.
I know he’s waiting.	Nayax yattwa jupax suyt’aski.
But you decided to take the car.	Ukampis jumax uka auto apsuñ amtawayta.
But he knew he had to do it.	Ukampis uk lurañapawa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He was the only one who wanted to do that.	Jupa sapakiw ukham lurañ munäna.
He doesn’t know words like that.	Jupax janiw ukham arunak yatkiti.
But it turned out that this didn't matter.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw amuyasïna.
She is amazing and fascinating.	Jupax muspharkañawa ukat wali muspharkañawa.
He barely had enough for a good meal.	Mä suma manqʼañatakejj jukʼakiw jupajj utjäna.
You are alone here.	Jumax sapakiw aka chiqan jikxatastaxa.
But it’s good for you.	Ukampis jumatakix wali askiwa.
But I'm still worried.	Ukampis wali llakistwa.
It’s been an amazing year for me.	Nayatakix mä muspharkañ maraw utjawayi.
I really understood that.	Chiqpachansa uk amuyayäta.
He didn't want to see it that way.	Jupajj janiw ukham uñjañ munkänti.
There was not much time for that.	Ukatakejj janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti.
Except cold, small, lonely.	Jan ukasti thaya, jisk’a, sapaki.
Every day someone wants to see him.	Sapa uruw maynix jupar uñjañ muni.
He worked quietly.	Jupajj amukiw irnaqäna.
He wanted no one to see me but himself.	Jupajj janiw khitis nayar uñjañ munkänti, jan ukasti jupaw uñjañ munäna.
I said it was true.	Chiqpachansa sasaw sista.
Except ten years later.	Jan ukasti tunka mara qhepatwa.
The snow.	Uka ch’uqi.
It feels like a long time to me.	Nayatakix wali jaya pachaw amuyasi.
He knew immediately what it was.	Kunas ukajj uk jankʼakiw yatïna.
And he wasn't sure why.	Ukat kunatsa uk janiw sum yatkänti.
Now it’s even harsher.	Jichhax juk’amp qhuru.
I look forward to it every day.	Nayax sapa uruw uk suyt’ta.
As if he were a bad guy.	Jupajj jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhama.
There is no reason why this happened to me.	Kunatsa nayarojj ukham pasäna ukajj janiw utjkiti.
I have seen this happen many times.	Ukham lurasajj walja kutiw uñjta.
But somehow, that wasn’t enough.	Ukampis kunjamatsa, ukax janiw wakiskänti.
And more needs to be done.	Ukat juk’amp lurañaw wakisi.
I asked myself.	Naya pachpaw jisktʼasta.
Do what you’ve always done, do everything you’ve ever done.	Kuntï lurawaykta uk luram, taqe kuntï lurawaykta uk luram.
It doesn’t mean people weren’t there.	Janiw jaqinakax jan utjkänti sañ munkiti.
Very popular of course.	Wali uñt’atawa chiqpachansa.
Every moment of the day.	Sapa pachaw uka urux utji.
It can take a year.	Mä maraw pasaspa.
In this respect, he is delightful.	Uka tuqitxa, jupax kusiskañawa.
Of course, we will.	Chiqansa, ukham lurañäni.
No one will be there.	Janiw khitis ukan utjkaniti.
I don't have one.	Janiw nayajj mä jukʼa utjkituti.
It really couldn't be any other way.	Chiqansa janiw yaqha tuqitxa utjkaspati.
He didn't seem human.	Jupajj janiw jaqëkaspas ukhamäkänti.
You want to build or buy a better house.	Jumax juk’amp suma uta lurañ jan ukax alañ munasma.
It’s what we do.	Ukax kuntix lurapkta ukawa.
I understand if you don’t want to work here.	Nayax amuyasta, jumatix jan akan irnaqañ munkta ukhaxa.
He told her everything.	Taqe kunwa jupar yatiyäna.
The film is a hit.	Película ukax wali uñt’atawa.
All the water.	Taqi uka uma.
But he left out one thing.	Ukampis mä toqetwa jaytawayi.
He can be very useful to you.	Jupajj jumatakejj wali askïspawa.
It was stupid, he wanted this.	Loqhe ukhamänwa, jupajj aka munäna.
Many, very early.	Walja, wali nayra.
I love it just the way it is.	Kunjamtï utjki ukhamakiw walpun munasta.
He knows the snowflakes.	Jupax ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi yati.
He knew the truth about himself.	Jupa pachpat kunatï cheqäki uk sum yatïna.
But he died that day.	Ukampis uka uruw jupajj jiwjjäna.
Things had to be repeated.	Kunanaktï mayamp mayamp lurañaw wakisïna.
Last year was pretty good.	Qhipa marax wali sumapunïnwa.
He knew what lay ahead.	Kunas jutïrin pasani uk sum yatïna.
He wanted to know where it was going.	Kawkirus purini uk yatiñwa munäna.
I promise you to do it.	Uk lurañamawa sasaw arsuwayta.
He knows the fact.	Jupajj uka cheq yati.
It really takes the same amount of time.	Chiqpachansa pachpa tiempow sarañapa.
They have no problem.	Jupanakajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
I want that word.	Nayax uka aru munta.
Maybe he was asleep.	Inas jupajj ikiskäna.
And of course, he can't.	Ukat chiqansa, janiw ukham lurkaspati.
There was nothing else to do, he said.	Janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti sasaw jupajj säna.
This requires more time alone.	Ukatakejj sapak jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
It can be treated however you want.	Ukajj kunjamtï munkta ukhamwa uñjasispa.
But he loves them just as much.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamarakiw jupanakar wal munasi.
That’s okay, absolutely nothing.	Ukax walikïskiwa, janipuniw kunas utjkiti.
Or so it seems at the time.	Jan ukajj uka tiempon ukham amuyasi.
But so far he has done everything.	Ukampis jichhakamajj taqe kunwa luräna.
Now, tell me what you didn’t do well.	Jichhax, kuntix jan sum lurapkta uk yatiyapxita.
I’m always looking for them.	Nayax sapa kutiw jupanakar thaqhaskta.
And of course, there was nothing.	Ukat chiqansa, janiw kunas utjkänti.
It’s awesome and all kinds of beautiful.	Ukax wali muspharkañawa ukat taqi kasta suma uñt’atawa.
I am sure he can do that.	Ukham luraspa sasaw nayajj yatta.
And a beer.	Ukat mä cerveza.
Better than you, maybe.	Jumat sipansa juk’amp askiwa, inas.
I’m the only one .	Nayax ukakiw .
It’s really cool, actually.	Chiqpachansa wali sumawa, chiqpachansa.
It happened a long time ago.	Walja tiempo nayraw pasäna.
But let’s see what he said.	Ukampis kuntï siskäna uk uñjañäni.
When you make a film.	Kunapachatï mä película lurapkta ukhajja.
Money is everything you need.	Qullqix taqi kunaw wakisi.
I love old stuff.	Nayax nayra yänak walpun munasta.
He said goodnight.	Jupajj suma arumaw säna.
This afternoon was very sad.	Jichha tardejj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna.
He will do this job.	Jupaw aka irnaqäw lurani.
But he was watching.	Ukampis jupajj uñchʼukiskäna.
I want money, and that’s not enough.	Nayax qullqi munta, ukat ukax janiw wakiskiti.
I know very well that you know that.	Nayax wali sum yatta, jumax uk yatisktawa.
He was the only one who really saw it.	Jupa sapakiw chiqpachapuni uñjäna.
It started to creep in again.	Ukajj wasitatwa jupar mantañ qalltäna.
How he did it is amazing.	Kunjamsa jupajj uk luräna ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
Things happening.	Kunanakas pasaspa.
The whole meal was delicious.	Taqi uka manq’añax wali sumapunïnwa.
All of this is very difficult.	Taqi ukax wali ch’amawa.
Except when he’s not.	Jan ukasti kunapachatï jupax jan ukhamäki ukhaxa.
That’s good for you, he says.	Ukax jumatakix wali askiwa, sasaw saraki.
It really takes time.	Chiqpachansa, tiempow munasispa.
It really happened to us.	Chiqpachansa jiwasax pasäna.
He was too upset to speak.	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna, janiw arskänti.
I’ve had it for about a week.	Nayax niya mä semanaw jikxatastxa.
He never knew what the problem was.	Kunas uka jan waltʼäwejj uk janipuniw yatkänti.
The holiday season is in full swing.	Fiesta pachax wali sumaw uñjasi.
He could have done it tomorrow.	Jupajj qharüruw uk luraspäna.
I don’t know if I will.	Janiw yatkti nayax lurkäti.
I want to go there with you.	Nayajj jumamp chikaw ukar sarañ munta.
Nothing is that good.	Janiw kunas ukham askïkiti.
Never mind, he said.	Janipuniw kunäkisa, sasaw säna.
That’s how he saw it for himself.	Ukhamwa jupa pachpa uñjäna.
It is shocking but wonderful.	Ukajj wali muspharkañawa ukampis wali muspharkañawa.
He says again, it’s very individual.	Jupax wasitat akham siwa, ukax wali sapa mayniw.
Also, the .	Ukhamaraki, uka .
No one told him to do that.	Janiw khitis ukham luram siskänti.

That was saying almost a little more.	Ukajj niya mä jukʼampiw parläna.
There's nothing more to do.	Janiw juk'amp lurañax utjkiti.
He wanted to see her again.	Jupajj wasitatwa uñjañ munäna.
No one seems to know for sure.	Janiw khitis sum yatkaspa ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't realize what he's done for a while.	Mä qhawqha tiempojj janiw uka luratapat amuykiti.
Because this doesn’t seem to work for me.	Kunatix akax janiw nayatakix askïkaspas ukhamäkiti.
It will happen to everyone.	Taqiniruw pasani.
I remember the incident vividly.	Uka paskäna uk sum amtaskta.
And yes it is.	Ukat jïsa ukhamawa.
He left the small town twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uka jiskʼa markat sarjjäna.
And the food is awfully fun.	Ukat manq’añax wali axsarkañ kusiskañawa.
I need to eat all the time.	Nayax sapa kutiw manq’añax wakisi.
No one, no one likes me.	Janiw khitis, janiw khitis nayar munaskiti.
And now school.	Ukat jichhax yatiqañ uta.
But he knows that is not the case.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti uk jupajj sum yati.
I’ve mentioned him before.	Nayax jupat nayraw arsuwayta.
Tell me about which one.	Kawkïr tuqitsa yatiyapxita.
He felt real.	Jupajj cheqpach jikjjatasïna.
And we have a little more inside.	Ukat mä jukʼampiw manqhan utjistu.
Here, too.	Akax, ukhamaraki.
Let me know if everything is OK.	Taqi kunas walikïskiti janicha uk yatiyapxita.
Everything is not bad.	Taqi kunas janiw jan walïkiti.
It’s good, and it’s very popular.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukat wali uñt’atawa.
So, everything but permission.	Ukhama, taqi kunas jan ukasti permiso.
He did it all over again.	Jupajj wasitatwa taqe ukanak luräna.
Nobody really liked it.	Janiw khitis chiqpachapunix gustkänti.
You clearly have yours.	Jumax qhanaw jumanakan utji.
That's how he spoke.	Ukhamaw jupajj parläna.
If the guy does it, it’s wrong.	Uka waynax uk luraspa ukhaxa, janiw walïkiti.
There is a little something about me.	Nayat mä jiskʼa kunaw utji.
I’ve done it all before.	Nayax nayrax taqi ukanak lurawayta.
If I had refused him.	Nayajj jupar jan iyaw sañ munkayäta ukhajja.
But it doesn't matter to me.	Ukampis nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
He didn't know how he felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasïna uk janiw yatkänti.
So he can't do it.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj lurkaspati.
They just know that.	Jupanakax ukhamakiw yatipxi.
Now he was the one who didn't speak.	Jichhajj jupaw jan arsüna.
I think this is .	Nayax akham amuyta .
But you want more than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼampiw munasma.
That's pretty cool, after all.	Ukajj wali sumawa, taqe kunat sipansa.
He’s exactly like that.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw ukhama.
He was a tall, tall man.	Jupajj jachʼa, jachʼa jaqënwa.
This time there was nothing.	Jichha kutix janiw kunas utjkänti.
He still leaves food behind.	Jupax wali manq’añanak jaytawayi.
The location is amazing.	Uka cheqan utjki ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
So, this is the truth.	Ukhama, akax chiqaw sañ muni.
We’re very passionate about it.	Jiwasax wali munasiñampiw uka tuqitxa.

You never knew what he was going to do.	Kunsa lurani uk janipuniw yatkayätati.
And still a whole lot.	Ukat wali mä taqpach chiqan.
I don’t want to do it again.	Janiw mayamp lurañ munkti.
Good beer, too.	Suma cerveza, ukhamaraki.
He had no idea where he went.	Jupajj kawkirus saräna uk janiw amuykänti.
He knows nothing about money.	Jupax janiw kuns qullqi tuqit yatkiti.
There was no reason not to go.	Janiw kuna razonas jan sarañapatak utjkänti.
And it took longer.	Ukat jukʼamp tiempow munasïna.

Every night we will build a new house.	Sapa arumaw mä machaq uta lurañäni.

It will be years before we move.	Janïr yaqha cheqar sarkasajj walja maranakaw pasani.

He himself left town for a while.	Jupa pachpaw mä jukʼa tiempojj markat sarjjäna.
He wants the unique.	Jupax jan uñt’at yänak munaraki.
He was very secretive about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal jamasat parläna.
So I'm happy to be there.	Ukhamajj kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
Things can never be the same again.	Janipuniw mayampsa kunanakas ukham utjkaspati.
We could have done a day in the country.	Jiwasax mä uruw markanx luraspäna.
He said it was okay.	Ukax walikïskiwa sasaw säna.
I built that beautiful house.	Nayax uka suma uta lurawayta.
You know, it’s not what you see.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw kunjamtï uñjkta ukhamäkiti.
But he really said it.	Ukampis cheqapuniw uk säna.
He needs to do more.	Jupajj jukʼamp lurañapawa.
Can’t really believe it.	Janiw chiqpachansa iyaw sañjamäkiti.
And he knew too much about her.	Ukat jupat sinti sum yatïna.
But there is something deeper.	Ukampis kunas jukʼamp manqhan utji.
They just don't know how.	Jupanakajj janiw kunjamsa uk lurañ yatipkiti.
I think he’s had a hard time.	Nayax amuyta, jupax wali ch’amaw jikxatasïna.
I think he can do anything.	Nayax amuyta, jupax kuns luraspawa.
And really, that’s how it feels.	Ukat chiqpachansa, ukhamaw jikxatasi.
Nothing has happened before.	Janiw kunas nayrax utjkiti.
See more here.	Aka chiqan juk’amp uñjañäni.
Of course, it is not necessary at all.	Chiqansa, janiw kunjamatsa wakiskiti.
Whoever did it was wonderful.	Khitis uk lurkäna ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
Nobody likes money.	Janiw khitis qullqix gustkiti.
So something had to be done.	Ukhamajj mä kun lurañaw wakisïna.
He can do more of it.	Jupajj jukʼampiw ukanak luraspa.
He doesn’t say that.	Jupax janiw uk arsu.
He was already back there.	Jupajj niyaw uka cheqar kuttʼjjäna.
I didn't want to do nothing.	Janiw nayajj jan kun lurañ munkayätti.
It was every night.	Ukajj sapa arumaw utjäna.
The day is almost here.	Uka urux niyaw purini.
This isn’t yours.	Akax janiw jumanakan utjkiti.
I don’t know how to take it seriously.	Janiw kunjamsa ukanak wali askit uñjañ yatkti.
My, my, people are amazing.	Nayan, nayan, jaqinakax muspharkañawa.
But it's still very nice.	Ukampis wali wali sumawa.
As it happens every day.	Kunjamtï sapa uru luraski ukhama.
At this point I can’t remember.	Aka pachanx janiw amtaskti.
I want to eat you.	Nayajj jumar manqʼañ munta.
Something was real.	Kunas chiqpachapuniw utjäna.
He left days later.	Jupajj urunak qhepatwa sarjjäna.
So there is more than him now.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jupat sipansa jukʼampiw utji.
But he didn't understand much.	Ukampis jupajj janiw wal amuykänti.
I love you, you know that.	Nayax jumarux walpun munasta, jumax uk yatisktawa.
I have myself now.	Nayax jichhax naya pachpaw utjitu.
This time he slammed the door.	Jichha kutix punku ch’allt’äna.
And then he couldn't sleep.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, janiw ikiñ puedkänti.
I haven’t seen all of that.	Janiw ukanak taqe kunsa uñjkti.
But in one respect it was not.	Ukampis mä tuqitxa janiw ukhamäkänti.
The future looks bright again.	Jutïr pachax wasitat wali sumaw uñtasi.
I think it’s good now.	Nayax jichhax wali askiwa sasaw amuyta.
For how long he didn’t quite know.	Qhawqha pachas jupax jan sum yatïna.
That, or money.	Uka, jan ukax qullqi.
I don't have it here.	Nayajj janiw akan utjkituti.
But he knew he had to.	Ukampis jupajj ukham lurañapawa, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
I can see that very clearly.	Ukjja wali qhanaw uñjta.
These last for a long time.	Ukanakajj walja tiempow utji.
Do it well, do it once.	Suma luram, mä kuti luram.
He may never know.	Inas janipuniw uk yatkchiti.
But that alone is not enough.	Ukampis uka sapakiw janiw walïkiti.
And, it’s a lot of fun.	Ukat, wali kusiskañawa.
He didn’t know, if anything.	Jupax janiw yatkänti, kunas ukax utjaspa ukhaxa.
Please tell me something else.	Yaqha yatiyapxita.
He left after all of you did.	Jupajj taqe jumanakajj lurapkta uka qhepatwa sarjjäna.
He lives alone.	Jupajj sapakiw jakasi.
Not the worst, but not the best.	Janiw jukʼamp jan walïkiti, ukampis janiw wali askïkiti.
He had a year.	Jupajj mä maraw utjäna.
I am in awe of you guys.	Nayajj jumanakat wal muspharta.
I still see this all the time.	Nayax akax taqi pachaw wali uñjta.
He comes here to see you every day.	Jupax sapa uruw jumar uñjir aka chiqar puri.
No one knows what happened to you.	Kunas jumamp pasäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I gave it to someone else.	Nayax yaqha jaqiruw ukanak churta.
And that was something.	Ukat ukajj mä kunaw utjäna.
He’s done just about everything.	Jupax niya taqi kuns lurawayi.
He’s cold, far away.	Jupax thaya, jaya.
Try to do it every day.	Sapa uru lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
Something much bigger.	Kunas juk’amp jach’a.
Things can get a little quick.	Kunanakas mä jukʼa jankʼakiw utjaspa.
He wanted to see it.	Jupajj uka uñjañ wal munäna.
It’s always moving and building.	Ukax sapa kutiw sarnaqaski ukat luraski.
So then this.	Ukhama ukat aka.
I know what you are doing.	Kuntï lurapkta uk sum yatta.
I think of a back room.	Nayax mä qhipa cuarto amuyta.
That’s good because, you know, it is.	Ukax wali askiwa kunatix, jumax yatisktawa, ukhamawa.
He thought he could do that.	Jupajj ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
And that's how he pulled it off, too.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj apsüna, ukhamaraki.
I mean, I'm so sorry.	Ukham sasaw sista, ukajj walpun llakista.
About how he could be.	Kunjamsa jupajj utjaspa uka toqet.
He meant it .	Jupajj uk sañ munäna .
I enjoyed this a lot.	Nayax akax wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He insisted it was impossible.	Jupajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa arsüna.
It felt like this.	Ukajj akham amuyasïna.
I look forward to each new day with him.	Jupamp chika sapa machaq uru suyt’askta.
I think it’s pretty cool.	Nayax wali ch’amawa sasaw amuyta.
Later, I saw it.	Qhepatjja, uk uñjta.
I am not your .	Nayajj janiw jumanakan .
No one mentioned the real reason.	Chiqpach kunatsa uk janiw khitis arskänti.
It’s the one that uses it.	Ukax uka apnaqi.
It’s the same today.	Jichhürunakanxa ukhamawa.
How he gave the money .	Kunjamsa jupajj uka qollqe churäna .
Very happy with how this turned out.	Wali kusisitaw kunjams akax utjawayi.
He knew it was nothing.	Jupajj janiw kunäkisa uk sum yatïna.
I guess that's why he never does.	Ukatwa janipuniw ukham lurkiti sasaw amuyta.
But it wasn't what he wanted.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï jupajj munkäna ukhamäkänti.
He had the basics.	Jupajj kunatï wakiski ukanakaw utjäna.
I decided to do these things.	Nayax ukanak lurañ amtawayta.
Had a good day today.	Jichhürunakanx mä suma uruw utjawayi.
Eventually, he learns that everything is clear.	Qhepatjja, taqe kunas qhanaw utji uk yati.
He doesn't want that stuff.	Jupajj janiw uka yänak munkiti.
He was amazed at how good it felt.	Kunjamsa ukajj wali sum jikjjatasïna uk jupajj wal muspharäna.
I don't need to do that.	Janiw nayajj ukham lurañajj wakiskiti.
You know what it is.	Jumax yatisktawa kunas ukax.
Now he doesn’t want to eat anywhere else.	Jichhax janiw yaqha chiqan manq’añ munkiti.
I want to give you one.	Mä churañ munta.
I have nothing more but myself again.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp utjkituti, jan ukasti naya pachpaw wasitat utjitu.
But he wanted to know all of this.	Ukampis taqe ukanak yatiñwa munäna.
And we’re better.	Ukat jiwasax juk’amp sumawa.
That all doesn’t matter.	Uka taqe kunas janiw kunäkisa.
But, it has always been that way for me.	Ukampis, nayatakejj ukham nayratpachaw utjäna.
And he’s all alone.	Ukat jupax taqpach sapakiw jikxatasi.
It happened to me all the time.	Nayarojj sapa kutiw pasäna.
No one knew how to use it.	Janiw khitis ukanak apnaqañ yatkänti.
But don't do anything to yourself.	Ukampis janiw juma pachpajj kunsa luramti.
That is not good for anyone.	Ukajj janiw khitirus walïkiti.
But before it was done before.	Ukampis janïr nayrajj luraskäna ukhajja.
It just keeps getting worse.	Ukax ukhamakiw juk’ampi juk’ampi.
He looks old-fashioned.	Jupax nayra pachan uñtatawa.
Let's see what he has to say.	Kuntï jupajj siski uk uñjañäni.
Now I know he is a good man.	Jichhajj wali suma jaqëtap yattwa.
He was kind of excited.	Jupajj mä jukʼa kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
He did it for her.	Jupaw jupatak luratayna.
Every day was something else.	Sapa uruw yaqha tuqit utjäna.
He was afraid many times.	Jupajj walja kutiw ajjsaräna.
He has certainly done so.	Jupajj cheqapuniw ukham lurawayi.
A word of	Mä aru .
Yes, it was everything he wanted.	Jïsa, taqe kuntï jupajj munkäna ukawa.
But, it’s really good.	Ukampis, chiqpachansa wali askiwa.
I started seeing him twice a week.	Semanan pä kutiw jupar uñjañ qalltawayta.
A dining room.	Mä manq’añ uta.
You are that person.	Jumax uka jaqïtawa.
He thought there was something wrong with me.	Jupajj kuna jan waltʼäwis utjitu sasaw amuyäna.
It’s not in the area.	Janiw uka chiqanx utjkiti.
I haven’t seen it all yet.	Janiw jichhakamax taqpach uñjkti.
You like him and he likes you.	Jumax juparux gusti ukat jupax jumarux gusti.
I prefer it as well.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jukʼamp munta.
He’s in that predicament.	Jupax uka jan walt’äwin uñjasi.
I’m extremely excited.	Nayax sinti kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He did that and it was great.	Jupax ukham luratayna ukat wali sumapunïnwa.
Also, she said.	Ukhamaraki, sasaw jupax säna.
More than half of it.	Chikat juk’ampi.
As it happened, no.	Kunjamtï paskäna ukhama, janiw.
And, that’s fine.	Ukat, ukax wali askiwa.
He was staring at the door.	Jupajj punku uñchʼukiskäna.
You were the only one who did that.	Juma sapakiw ukham lurayäta.
I thought that said something about me.	Ukajj nayat kuns säna sasaw amuyayäta.
Later, he asked her.	Qhepatjja, jupajj uk jisktʼäna.
It’s a very hot day.	Uka urux wali junt’u.
But it was a clear start.	Ukampis ukajj qhanaw qalltäna.
He is the one who handles it well.	Jupaw ukanak sum apnaqi.
But it really had to be done.	Ukampis chiqpachansa ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
I like it, this car.	Nayatakix wali askiwa, aka auto.
This is my first time coming to town.	Akax nayrïr kutiw markar jutta.
A couple of nights.	Mä pä arumax.
And money, of course.	Ukat qullqi, chiqpachansa.
So he lives alone.	Ukhamajj sapakiw jakasi.
It doesn't matter, he thought.	Janiw kunas wakiskiti, sasaw amuyäna.
He started to say that.	Jupax ukham sañ qalltäna.
I did this not too long ago.	Nayax janiw sinti nayrax ukham lurawayta.
He wanted to get there.	Jupajj ukaruw puriñ munäna.
It never means that.	Janipuniw ukham sañ munkiti.
It worked for a long time.	Ukajj walja tiempow irnaqäna.
He felt himself doing so.	Ukham lurasajj jupa pachpaw amuyasïna.
He looked so happy .	Jupajj wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna .
So far it’s pretty cool about that.	Jichhakamax uka tuqitx wali ch’amawa.
But he didn't mean that, she said.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkänti, sasaw jupajj säna.
I’m sure one would be interesting.	Nayax yatxatwa maynix wali askïspawa.
I've said that before.	Nayajj nayraw ukham sista.
I wasn't such a big thinker.	Janiw ukham jachʼa amuyirïkti.
No one did it for you.	Janiw khitis jumatakix uk lurkänti.
Better than nothing maybe, but .	Jan kunat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa inas, ukampis .
I had no idea why this would happen.	Kunatsa ukham pasaspa uk janiw amuykayätti.
I’m taking good care of that.	Nayax uka tuqit sum uñjta.
There is nothing about him.	Janiw kunas jupat utjkiti.
There was a chance, always a chance.	Mä ch’amaw utjäna, sapa kutiw mä ch’am utjäna.
He didn't want that.	Jupajj janiw ukham munkänti.
But he lives again.	Ukampis wasitatwa jakasi.
But he never wanted to believe it.	Ukampis janipuniw iyaw sañ munkänti.
But there is one thing he is wrong with.	Ukampis mä kunaw jupajj jan walïkiti.
He thinks it’s awesome.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa sasaw amuyi.
He didn't care where we went.	Jupajj kawkirus sarapjjta uk janiw kuns lurkänti.
It’s not like he is.	Janiw jupax ukhamäkiti.
And this is the most important day.	Ukat aka urux wali wakiskiriwa.
But it happened at night.	Ukampis arumaw ukham pasäna.
Except, well, everything.	Jan ukasti, wali, taqi kuna.
You can do it almost anywhere.	Niya kawkhansa ukanak lurasma.
So it wasn't very long.	Ukhamajj janiw sinti jaya tiempojj ukhamäkänti.
But nothing was current.	Ukampis janiw kunas jichha tiempon utjkänti.
It knows exactly where you are.	Ukajj kawkhansa jikjjatasta uk sum yati.
What’s great, what .	Kunas jach’a, kuna .
He had just come.	Jupajj jichhakiw jutäna.
I never want to see that again.	Janipuniw mayampsa ukham uñjañ munkti.
He’s obviously very uncomfortable.	Jupax qhanaw wali jan walin uñjasi.
I never thought something like this could happen.	Janipuniw ukham kunas pasaspa sasin amuyirïkti.
It’s going to rain now.	Jichhax jallu purini.
Probably longer than that.	Inas ukat sipansa jukʼamp jaya.
What he really wanted from her.	Kuntï jupat cheqpachapun munkäna ukjja.
I am so glad he did.	Ukham luratapat walpun kusista.
He says he wasn't.	Janiw jupajj utjkänti sasaw saraki.
And there was light.	Ukat qhanaw utjäna.
He left too early.	Jupajj wali nayraw sarjjäna.
It seemed so cold and heartless.	Ukajj wali thaya ukat jan chuymanïkaspas ukhamänwa.
I thought these were interesting.	Ukanakajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
It was not a yes or no.	Ukajj janiw mä jïsa ni janis ukhamäkänti.
And then tonight.	Ukat ukat jichha arumax.
I can’t do that again.	Nayax janiw uka wasitat lurañjamäkiti.
Just what you want and what happens.	Kunatï munkta ukat kunas pasaski ukakiw utji.
It’s just amazingly beautiful.	Ukax mä muspharkañ sumawa.
I went through it fast last night.	Nayax qhipa arumax uka tuqit jank’akiw sarawayta.
The next day you tell me.	Qhipürux jumax nayaruw yatiyäta.
I want to know the truth.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk yatiñwa munta.
He stared longer and longer.	Jupajj jukʼamp tiempow uñchʼukiskäna.
I don’t really know how.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapuni kunjamsa uk yatkti.
He died almost immediately.	Niya jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
I have seen this used myself.	Naya pachpaw aka apnaqañ uñjta.
He couldn't even do it.	Jupajj janiw ni puedkänti.
He wasn't sure about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet sum amuyaskänti.
Time goes by, and longer.	Tiempox saraski, ukat juk’amp tiempow saraski.
I expected better.	Nayajj jukʼamp sumwa suykayäta.
But I don’t want to get into it.	Ukampis janiw ukar mantañ munkti.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with it.	Chiqansa, janiw kuna jan wali lurañas utjkiti.
Maybe later one day.	Inas qhepat mä uru.
But it leaves one person, me, uncomfortable.	Ukampis mä jaqiruw jaytawayi, nayaruw jan walin uñjasi.
I hope for the rest.	Nayax qhipharux suyt’twa.
But the guy wasn’t here anywhere.	Ukampis uka waynax janiw akan kawkhans utjkänti.
Who knew what happened to him.	Khitis yatïna kunas jupat pasäna.
That period ended about ten years ago.	Uka tiempojj niya tunka maranakaw tukuyäna.
Well, it’s even more exciting!.	¡Wali, juk’ampi kusiskañawa!.
No, don't do it.	Janiwa, jan luramti.
There is a time limit.	Kuna pachas utji.
But it worked fine.	Ukampis wali sumaw irnaqäna.
But he said it was important.	Ukampis wali wakiskiriwa sasaw säna.
He’s a little better today.	Jupax jichhürunakanx mä juk’a juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
He should do it for now.	Jichhakamajj uk lurañapawa.
And he knew why.	Ukat kunatsa uk yatïna.
I think that’s the best thing about me.	Nayax amuyta, ukax nayat wali askiwa.
Let’s do what we can.	Kuntï lurañjamäki ukanak lurañäni.
Make it clear to them.	Uk sum jupanakar yatiyañama.
I just thought of something.	Nayax jichhakiw kuns amuyta.
So there is nothing wrong with that.	Ukhamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis uka toqet utjkiti.
We can’t stand it anymore.	Jiwasax janiw juk’amp aguantañjamäkiti.
It was the only one out there.	Uka sapakiw uka anqan utjäna.
I’ve seen him.	Nayaw jupar uñjta.
This has nothing to do with me.	Akax janiw nayamp kuna lurañas utjkiti.
It spoke again.	Ukajj wasitatwa parläna.
It doesn’t matter if these are acceptable or not.	Ukanakax walikïskiti janicha ukax janiw kunäkisa.
Didn't do what he did.	Janiw kuntï lurkäna uk lurkänti.
She thought he was sincere.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw jupar uñji sasaw amuyäna.
It handles better.	Ukax juk’amp sum apnaqi.
That's a lot of light.	Ukajj walja qhanawa.
The first couple of months are fine.	Nayrïr pä phaxsinx wali askiwa.
Today, that still works for me.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I think he would like this.	Nayax amuyta, juparux akax wali askïspawa.
He had never said that before.	Janipuniw nayrajj ukham siskänti.
I would love for that to happen.	Ukham lurasiñap nayatakix wali askiwa.
A day later.	Mä uru qhepatjja.

I always did that.	Nayajj sapa kutiw ukham lurayäta.
Just what you want.	Kuntï munkta ukakiw wakisi.
I want to make a film.	Nayax mä película lurañ munta.
He himself lives in such a place.	Jupa pachpaw ukham chiqan jakasi.
He wanted the phone.	Jupajj uka telefonot wal munäna.
He was obviously in a bad mood.	Jupax qhanaw jan walin jikxatasïna.
But there was one thing he knew.	Ukampis mä toqetwa jupajj yatïna.
You know what to do wrong yourself.	Juma pachpaw kuna jan walinak lurañsa yatta.
That was the day I did it.	Uka uruw ukham lurawayta.
No, he wanted to know.	Janiwa, jupajj yatiñwa munäna.

But don’t leave him alone.	Ukampis janiw sapak jaytañamäkiti.
So no one knows.	Ukhamajj janiw khitis yatkiti.
Honestly, I feel better.	Chiqpachansa, jukʼamp sum jikxatastxa.
He drove there one night.	Mä arumaw autot uka cheqar saräna.
Maybe he would have done that.	Inas ukham luraspäna.
He did it well enough.	Jupajj sumwa uk luräna.
Great day indeed.	Jach’a uru chiqpachansa.
There is no need to do anything else about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw yaqha tuqit lurañax wakiskiti.

But he was, so that was it.	Ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa, ukhamajj ukhamänwa.
I’ve been worried before.	Nayax nayrax llakistwa.
Of course, this is not the right thing to do.	Chiqansa, janiw ukax askïkiti.
Almost everything about it is good.	Uka tuqitxa niya taqi kunas wali askiwa.

Ten great little ones.	Tunka jach’a jisk’a.
You know how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
And yes, this is really cool.	Ukat jïsa, akax chiqpachans wali sumawa.
You can do it almost every night of the week.	Niya sapa arumaw semanan lurasma.
And he did it brilliantly.	Ukat jupajj wali sumwa uk luräna.
You have only one.	Jumax mä sapakiw utji.
I don't want to drink anymore.	Janiw jukʼamp umañ munkti.
Check out the photos.	Uka fotonak uñjañäni.
Who's who.	Khitis khitïnsa.
I had almost nothing to do.	Niya janiw kuna lurañas utjkitänti.
I’m nobody right now.	Nayax janiw khitis jichhax.
There is no reason why.	Janiw kunatsa ukhamäkiti.
I wasn't there.	Nayajj janiw uka cheqan utjkänti.
That’s kind of hard.	Ukax mä kasta ch’amawa.
How necessary it is.	Kunjamsa ukajj wakisi.
And he’s very good at it.	Ukat jupax uka tuqitx wali sum yati.
Then he turned back to me.	Ukat wasitatwa nayar kuttʼjjäna.
Surprisingly, he was nice to her.	Muspharkañawa, juparux wali suma uñjäna.
Which he never means.	Ukax janipuniw jupax sañ munkiti.
I have the same problem.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jan waltʼäwin jikjjatasta.
You know exactly when the money is due.	Kunapachas qullqix purini uk sum yatta.
It always gives me something.	Ukax sapa kutiw kuns churitu.
In a snowflake.	Mä ch’uqi ukan.
But he went there .	Ukampis jupajj ukaruw saräna .
I don’t want to say anything bad about him.	Janiw jupat jan walinak parlañ munkti.
I don’t know any more.	Nayax janiw juk’amp yatkti.
I know he doesn’t know.	Nayax yattwa jupax janiw yatkiti.
She didn't want a man.	Jupajj janiw mä chachar munkänti.
Well, new to me though.	Ukhama, nayatakix machaq ukhama.
You didn’t know why.	Jumax janiw kunatsa uk yatkayätati.
This was out of place.	Ukajj janiw cheqan utjkänti.
But for now.	Ukampis jichhakamax.
He doesn't want to go.	Janiw jan sarañ munkiti.
Everything is fine with you.	Taqi kunas jumatakix walikïskiwa.
But that happened very rarely.	Ukampis ukajj wali jukʼakiw pasäna.
They know when we are.	Jupanakax kunapachas jiwasax uk yatipxi.
It was that kind of time.	Uka kasta tiempojj ukhamänwa.
It won't last very long.	Janiw sinti jaya tiempojj utjkaniti.
I don’t get that at all.	Janiw uk kuns jikxatkti.
I think it’s him.	Jupaw sasaw amuyta.
I miss the house a lot, too.	Nayax utar walpun llakista, ukhamaraki.
I’ve seen them many times.	Walja kutiw jupanakar uñjta.
It’s got a weird look.	Ukax mä muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
I never saw the thing again.	Janiw mayamps uka yänak uñjkti.
But I don’t want to buy it.	Ukampis janiw alañ munkti.
He’s already planned it all out.	Jupax nayratpach taqi ukanak amtawayi.
It’s spacious, quiet and looks awesome.	Ukax jach’a, amukiw ukat wali muspharkañ uñtatawa.
That’s how this is going.	Ukhamaw akax saraski.
So you know what happened.	Ukhamajj kunas pasäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
Twice is good enough.	Pä kutix wali askiwa.
It feels relatively quiet.	Ukajj mä jukʼa amukiw jikjjatasi.
He’s been there for a long, long time.	Jupax wali jaya, jaya pachaw ukan jikxatasïna.
I told him it wasn’t necessary.	Nayax juparux janiw wakiskiti sasaw sista.
It does what it says it does.	Kuntï siski uk luraski.
He fell in love with her immediately.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupar munasïna.
He wanted to do it.	Jupajj uk lurañ wal munäna.
It needs to be done in two ways.	Pä tuqit lurañaw wakisi.
I don’t want that big of a house.	Janiw nayax uka jach’a utax munkti.
We have everything we need to do this.	Uka lurañatakix taqi kunaw utjistu.
And it was a surprise.	Ukat wal muspharäna.
He chooses to live by it.	Jupaw uka tuqit jakañ amti.
He or she is out there somewhere.	Jupax jan ukax jupax kawkhans ukan jikxatasi.
The process lasted about an hour.	Uka lurañajj niya mä horaw utjäna.
Overall, it’s amazing.	Taqi kunat sipansa, muspharkañawa.
I realize now what happened.	Kunatï paskäna uk jichhajj amuyasta.
I hope that day comes soon.	Uka urux jankʼakiw purini sasaw suytʼaskta.
I was very reluctant to leave him.	Nayajj jupar jaytañ wal jan munkti.
He takes better care of it.	Jupaw jukʼamp sum uñji.
I didn't understand it before.	Nayrajj janiw amuykayätti.
He's my	Jupax nayan .
But it was quickly realized.	Ukampis jankʼakiw amuyasïna.
I am eager to know what is next!.	¡Kunas jutïrin utjani uk yatiñ wal munta!.
He had a very sad and quiet morning.	Jupajj alwajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat amukiw jikjjatasïna.
There’s no future there.	Janiw jutïr pachax ukanx utjkiti.
This is good when you need it.	Ukax wali askiwa kunapachatï wakiski ukhaxa.
It certainly doesn’t happen to me.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayatakix ukhamäkiti.
He didn't, but he didn't want to admit it.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurkänti, ukampis janiw uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
No one knew why he did that.	Kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
That was not the question at the time.	Uka jisktʼajj janiw uka tiempon utjkänti.
He just says that.	Jupax ukhamakiw siwa.
Just once, that’s all it took.	Mä kutikiw, ukakiw wakisïna.
There is truth in it.	Ukanjja, kunatï cheqäki ukaw utji.
I was especially nervous at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, nayajj jukʼampiw ajjsarayäta.
He felt a little silly.	Jupajj mä jukʼa loqhe jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasïna.
I didn’t get a job like that.	Nayax janiw ukham irnaqäw jikxatkti.
He never did anything wrong.	Janipuniw jan walinak lurkänti.
But we don't have that.	Ukampis jiwasajj janiw ukham utjkiti.
Not that the boy knew or understood.	Janiw uka waynax yatkänti ni amuyaskänti.
But nothing was forthcoming.	Ukampis janiw kunas jutïrin utjkänti.
Finally, he went home.	Qhepatjja, utaparuw sarjjäna.
I want to do a better job.	Nayax juk’amp suma irnaqäw lurañ munta.
I love going home.	Utar sarañajj nayatakejj walpun gustitu.
You know how things are now.	Jumax yatisktawa kunjams jichhax kunas utji.
Breakfast was good but no dinner.	Desayuno ukax wali askiwa ukampis janiw manq’añax utjkänti.
Now tell me what just happened.	Jichhax kunas jichhak pasäna uk yatiyapxita.
But it wasn’t this time.	Ukampis janiw jichha kutin ukhamäkänti.
I didn’t think of anything.	Janiw nayax kuns amuyirïkti.
You’re a bigger person.	Jumax juk’amp jach’a jaqiwa.
There, almost everything seems impossible.	Ukanjja, niya taqe kunas jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa uñjasi.
Now about that.	Jichhax uka tuqitxa.
Everything is fine so far.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw jichhakamax utji.
You just don’t know.	Jumax ukhamakiw jan yatkayätati.
Or so he thinks.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jupajj amuyi.
Hence two things can happen.	Ukatwa pä kunas pasaspa.
It doesn’t, but it feels like it.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, ukampis ukham amuyasi.
It already knew that.	Ukajj nayratpachaw yatïna ukjja.
After he agreed, he went back to sleep.	Jupajj iyaw säna uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa ikiñar sarjjäna.
I don’t really want to talk about it.	Janiw chiqpachansa uka tuqit parlañ munkti.
This may take up to a week.	Ukatakejj mä semanaw munasispa.
In fact, he doesn't know anything else.	Chiqansa, janiw yaqha tuqitsa yatkiti.
So much more of the same.	Ukhama juk’ampi pachpa.
Maybe two years or so.	Inas pä mara jan ukax ukhama.
I love these books.	Nayax uka libronak walpun munasta.
He was almost always financially stable.	Jupax niya sapa kutiw qullqi tuqitx jikxatasïna.
A few times.	Mä qhawqha kuti.
That is not a good thing to do.	Uk lurañajj janiw walïkiti.
We can’t have that.	Jiwasax janiw ukham utjkaspati.
I’m sorry, it just happened.	Nayax llakistwa, ukhamakiw pasäna.
It would take more time.	Jukʼamp tiempow munasispa.
But that was completely wrong.	Ukampis ukajj taqe chuymaw jan walinak parläna.
He bought a car.	Jupajj mä auto alasïna.
I mean I’m hungry.	Nayax manq’at awtjataw sañ munta.
He left in the morning.	Jupajj alwaw sarjjäna.
But he refuses to eat this morning.	Ukampis jichha alwajj janiw manqʼañ munkiti.
Ten bedrooms.	Tunka ikiñan.
But it was as true as anything.	Ukampis kunjamtï kunas cheqäki ukhamänwa.
I want to give it to them now.	Nayax jichhax jupanakar churañ munta.
No one inside the car.	Janiw khitis auto manqhan utjkiti.
I know how I mean it.	Kunjamsa uk sañ munta uk sum yatta.
Just like he says.	Kunjamtï jupajj siski ukhama.
You can do a little or a lot.	Mä juk’a jan ukax walja lurañanak lurasma.
These are the things that will happen.	Ukanakaw pasani.
This is the rich man.	Akax qamir jaqiwa.
I asked him how he knew.	Kunjamsa uk yati sasaw jupar jisktʼta.
No one, there is.	Janiw khitis, utjkiti.
Anything seemed possible.	Kunas lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
Now it’s time to go, go, go.	Jichhax sarañ pachaw purini, sarañ, sarañ pachaw purini.
Who is as awesome as ever.	Khitis nayrjamajj wali muspharkañawa.
He started going every week.	Jupajj sapa semanaw sarañ qalltäna.
He wants more and more.	Jupajj jukʼamp jukʼampiw muni.
It was his coffee.	Ukajj jupan café satänwa.
He adamantly refused.	Jupajj janiw sasaw taqe chuyma arsüna.
I know that with all my heart now.	Jichhajj taqe chuymaw uk yatta.
I know that happened.	Ukajj pasäna uk sum yatta.
Someone else is more important.	Maynix juk’amp wakiskir jaqiwa.
But, not at all.	Ukampis, janiw kunjamatsa.
Small but comfortable.	Jisk’a ukampis suma.
There’s the same dining area.	Uka pachpa manq’añ chiqaw utji.
A couple of things here for me.	Mä pä kunaw akanx nayatakix utjitu.
It looks like a long time.	Ukax jaya pachaw uñtasi.
And no one else could do it.	Ukat janiw khitis uk lurkaspänti.
He didn't say anything, she didn't say anything.	Jupajj janiw kuns arskänti, jupajj janiw kuns siskänti.
That’s really big.	Ukax chiqpachapuniw jach’a.
I never have anything for myself.	Janipuniw nayajj kunas nayatak utjkituti.
You just do very, very well.	Jumax ukhamakiw wali, wali sum lurasma.
But there’s one thing first.	Ukampis mä kunaw nayraqat utji.

I think that person is awesome.	Nayajj uka jaqejj wali muspharkañawa.
A little expensive, but very very good.	Mä juk’a qullqi, ukampis wali wali suma.
Now she’s a woman.	Jichhax jupax mä warmiwa.
Or he didn't understand what he meant.	Jan ukajj kuntï sañ munkäna uk janiw amuykänti.
I’d like to see a lot more.	Nayax juk’amp walja uñjañ munta.
But you believe it.	Ukampis jumax uk iyaw satawa.
This year is big, big.	Jichha marax jach’a, jach’a.
He did all the work.	Jupaw taqi uka lurañanak luräna.
Just like he said he would.	Kunjamtï jupajj lurä sasin siskäna ukhama.
It doesn’t work that well.	Janiw ukham sum irnaqkiti.
I’ve always understood.	Nayax nayratpachaw amuyasta.
He’s such a guy.	Jupax ukham waynawa.
You are already .	Jumax niyaw .
I saw him last night here.	Nayax juparux qhipa arumaw akan uñjta.
Quiet and sad.	Amukiw ukat llakitaw jikxatasi.
He knows a lot about it.	Jupajj uka toqet wal yati.
I want to do something, but I don’t know what.	Nayax kuns lurañ munta, ukampis janiw kuns yatkti.
Anyone could do what you do.	Kuntï jumajj lurkta uk khitis luraspänwa.
He went back with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw kuttʼjjäna.
This isn’t a bad thing.	Akax janiw jan walïkiti.
He told me that he was completely happy at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, taqpach kusisitaw jikjjatasta sasaw sitäna.
I said it doesn't matter.	Nayajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw sista.
I think that is pretty obvious.	Ukajj wali qhanaw sasaw amuyta.
And do what you say.	Ukat kuntï jumax siskta uk luram.
Do all of this, as soon as you can.	Taqe ukanak luram, jankʼakiw ukanak luram.
It didn’t feel like it.	Janiw ukham amuyaskänti.
Overall this is good.	Taqi kunat sipansa akax wali askiwa.
So as he goes.	Ukhamajj kunjamtï jupajj saraski ukhama.
Of course this is more difficult.	Chiqansa akax juk’amp ch’amawa.
I’m hoping to have a little more to do soon.	Nayax mä juk’a juk’amp lurañanak jank’akiw utjani sasaw suyt’askta.
So he’s both.	Ukhamajj panpachaniw jupajj.
Now, with you.	Jichhax, jumamp chika.
He wants to get out of here.	Jupax aka chiqat mistuñ muni.
But it’s not that kind of night.	Ukampis janiw ukham arumax ukhamäkiti.
I am not denying that.	Janiw nayajj uk jan iyaw siskti.
Something is very difficult.	Kunas wali ch’amawa.
No one is always wrong.	Janiw khitis sapa kuti jan walïkiti.
All of this is no better.	Taqe ukanakajj janiw jukʼamp askïkiti.
Everyone has a place there.	Sapa mayniw ukanx mä chiqaw utji.
I think you’re too good for that, too.	Nayax amuyta jumax ukatakix wali sumawa, ukhamaraki.
I thought quickly.	Nayax jank'akiw amuyta.
There was a sense of inaction.	Ukanjja, mä jan kun lurañaw utjäna.
He sat there for a few moments.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow qontʼasïna.
No one doesn’t like him.	Janiw khitis jupar jan gustkiti.
I didn’t mean all that.	Janiw taqe ukanak sañ munkayätti.
I have always loved to go.	Nayax nayratpachaw sarañ walpun munta.
This is even better.	Akax juk’amp sumawa.
He watched her in silence.	Jupajj amukiw jupar uñjäna.
Everyone has something, he says.	Taqinipuniw kunas utji, sasaw saraki.
He will do it again.	Jupajj wasitatwa lurani.
Do this with as little effort as possible.	Ukxa juk’a ch’amampiw lurañama.
But, that doesn’t matter.	Ukampis, ukax janiw kunäkisa.
He admits what he did wrong.	Kuntï jan wal lurkäna uk arsu.
There was no reason to rush.	Janiw kunatsa jankʼak lurañajj utjkänti.
I didn't understand anything about it.	Ukjja janiw kunsa amuykayätti.
He obviously wanted to talk to her.	Jupajj qhanaw jupamp parltʼañ munäna.
He had no idea what it was.	Jupajj kunas ukajj uk janiw amuykänti.
He was happy all day.	Jupajj taqe uruw kusisit jikjjatasïna.
What you have done here.	Kuntï jumajj aka cheqan lurawaykta ukajja.
I have nothing better to do.	Janiw kunas jukʼamp sum lurañajj utjkituti.
He saw the car.	Jupajj uka auto uñjäna.
He’s not like that right now.	Jupax jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it was, for me anyway.	Ukampis ukhamänwa, nayatakejj kunjamatsa.
I struggled with it every day .	Sapa uruw uka toqet wal chʼamachasiyäta .
I think it’s good to do that.	Nayax amuyta, ukham lurañax wali askiwa.
Let’s do it for me this time.	Jichha kutix nayatakix lurañäni.
And he just started.	Ukat jupax jichhakiw qalltäna.
He wanted to know now.	Jupajj jichhajj yatiñwa munäna.
He could do what he did well.	Kuntï lurkäna uk sum luraspäna.
So he didn't want that to happen again.	Ukhamajj janiw jukʼamp ukham pasañap munkänti.
He didn't understand how or why.	Kunjamsa ni kunatsa uk janiw amuykänti.
And that’s it! 	¡Ukat ukax!
Of course it needs to be done.	Chiqansa lurañaw wakisi.
He started to say something.	Kuns arsuñ qalltäna.
I was just so nervous.	Nayajj ukhamakiw wal ajjsarayäta.
Fortunately that wasn’t the case.	Wali askiwa ukax janiw ukhamäkänti.
He had no immediate comment.	Jupajj janiw jankʼak kuns arskänti.
We don't have that kind of thing.	Jiwasajj janiw ukham lurañajj utjkiti.
You know how to study.	Jumax kunjams yatxatañ yatta.
That’s the kind of guy he was.	Ukhamaw jupax uka kasta waynax utjäna.
So later that summer he did.	Ukhamajj uka verano qhepatjja, ukhamwa luräna.
I hold them in high esteem.	Jupanakar wali askit uñjta.
Maybe your .	Inas jumanakan .
You are a wonder, you are.	Jumax mä muspharkañawa, jumax ukhamawa.
But that was the first time I realized it.	Ukampis ukajj nayrïr kutikiw amuyasta.
But, something is fine.	Ukampis, kunas walikïskiwa.
You’ll need it every now and then.	Jichhax sapa kutiw ukax munasini.

Twice you think.	Pä kutiw jumax amuyta.
He knows all the facts.	Jupajj taqe kuntï cheqäki uk sum yati.
So, I want to repeat myself.	Ukhama, nayax wasitat arsuñ munta.
I’m still doing that here.	Nayax waliw akanx ukham luraskta.
He almost called her.	Jupajj niyaw jupar jawsäna.
You want to talk, you want to talk.	Jumax parlañ munta, parlañ munta.
I really can’t say.	Chiqpachansa janiw siskti.
I know it’s not like that.	Janiw ukhamäkiti uk sum yatta.
This can be very beneficial for you.	Ukham lurasajj jumatakejj wali askïspawa.

No, he thought.	Janiwa, sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
I love everything about you.	Nayax jumanakat taqi kuns walpun munasta.
He doesn't think that's possible.	Jupajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykiti.
It’s so much bigger.	Ukhama wali jach’a.
The delay is very obvious.	Uka qhipharux wali qhanaw uñjasi.
He understood me.	Jupaw nayarojj amuyasïna.
No one knows if that is right.	Ukajj walikïskiti janicha uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
I say that every year.	Nayax sapa maraw ukham sista.
I didn’t know what was going to happen.	Kunas pasani uk janiw yatkayätti.
So let’s do that shit.	Ukhamajj uka jan walinak lurañäni.
He’s always been so good.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukham suma sarnaqäna.
But he can’t do the job alone.	Ukampis jupax janiw uka irnaqäw sapak lurkaspati.
In a country.	Mä markanwa.
For a time he said nothing.	Mä tiempojj janiw kuns arskänti.
He came to bed.	Jupax ikiñar jutäna.
They are really good for me.	Jupanakax chiqpachansa nayatakix wali askiwa.
Another challenge was time.	Yaqha jan waltʼäwejj tiempow utjäna.
That is what he advised.	Ukhamaw jupajj ewjjtʼäna.
But increasingly, the issue was financial.	Ukampis jukʼampiw uka jan waltʼäwejj qollqe toqet parläna.
And he acted like that.	Ukat jupax ukhamarakiw sarnaqäna.
But it is better today.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa jukʼamp askiwa.
He saw it happen.	Jupajj kunjamtï paskäna uk uñjäna.
I like to have lunch there.	Nayax uka chiqan chika uru manq’añax wali askiwa.
All over again, myself.	Taqi kunas wasitatwa, naya pachpa.
Everything is fine and everything is fine.	Taqi kunas walikïskiwa ukat taqi kunas walikïskiwa.
It’s a very big deal.	Sinti jach’a jaqiwa.
A warm water.	Mä junt’u uma.
And I don't see why he does that.	Ukat kunatsa ukham luri uk janiw uñjkti.
I knew exactly where I wanted to go.	Kawkirus sarañ munta uk sum yatiyäta.
I don't know how he could have done it.	Kunjamsa jupajj uk luraspäna uk janiw yatkti.
I did it again.	Nayajj wasitatwa ukham lurayäta.
I came to talk about it.	Nayajj uka toqet parlir jutta.
When he .	Kunapachatï jupax .
He says he doesn't know yet.	Jichhakamax janiw yatkti sasaw saraki.
I didn't want to hurt him.	Janiw nayajj jupar jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.
Each of us will do what we can.	Sapa mayniw kuntï lurañjamäki uk lurañäni.
They know everything that is going on.	Taqi kunas pasaski uk sum yatipxi.

Both of them are.	Panpachaniw jupanakax.
I’m sorry you have to rush this.	Nayax llakistwa akax jank’akiw lurañama.
That is what is needed now.	Ukaw jichhajj wakisi.
It went well on its own.	Ukax sapakiw wali sum saräna.
But he doesn't want to.	Ukampis janiw jupajj munaskiti.
A rock cold.	Mä qala thaya.
But, it’s already coming.	Ukampis, niyaw purini.
He doesn't care that these things will happen.	Ukanakajj pasani sasaw jupajj janiw kuns lurkiti.
But he knew it seemed possible.	Ukampis ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa jupajj sum yatïna.
I’ve seen it all over the country.	Nayax taqi markan uñjta.
I want to do it all the more for it.	Ukatakejj jukʼampiw uk lurañ munta.
I can’t do anything in this country.	Aka markanx janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
He learned to do what he wanted.	Kuntï munkäna uk lurañwa yateqäna.
Or it may take time to do so afterwards.	Jan ukajj uka qhepatjja, ukanak lurañatakejj tiempow munasispa.
And I have no problem with it.	Ukat janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis nayatakix utjkiti.
But time is moving on.	Ukampis tiempojj jukʼampiw saraski.
What he does is amazing.	Jupajj kuntï luraski ukajj wali muspharkañawa.
It is beautiful and delicious.	Ukajj wali suma ukat wali sumawa.

Or maybe twenty.	Jan ukax inas pä tunka.
He doesn't do anything about it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uka tuqitxa janiw kuns lurkiti.
And that’s actually the truth.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukax chiqaw sañ muni.
He never had any reason to do anything wrong.	Jupajj janipuniw kunatï jan walïki uk lurañatakejj kuna razonas utjkänti.
I know there isn’t.	Nayax yattwa janiw utjkiti.
Consider how he viewed it.	Kunjamsa jupajj uñjäna uk uñjañäni.
He was determined to do everything right.	Jupajj taqe kunwa sum lurañ amtäna.
He just quit his job.	Jupax jichhakiw irnaqañ jaytawayi.
I never expected this.	Janipuniw uk suykayätti.
It's a little weird.	Mä jukʼa muspharkañawa.
He knows these things well.	Jupajj ukanak sum yati.
He was passionate about it.	Jupajj uka toqet walpun munäna.
I barely wait.	Nayax juk’akiw suyt’ta.
So I don't like it.	Ukhamajj janiw nayar gustkituti.

How fast time flies.	Kunjamsa tiempojj jankʼak pasaski.
I really enjoyed it though!.	¡Chiqpachansa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta ukampis!.

If you want a smaller one, it is essential.	Mä jiskʼa munsta ukhajja, wali wakiskiriwa.

I’m looking forward to walking more.	Nayax juk’amp sarnaqañ suyt’askta.
But, it’s not worth doing it all over again.	Ukampis, janiw taqi ukanak wasitat lurañax askïkiti.
I've done that.	Nayajj uka toqetwa lurawayta.
Tonight was such a night.	Jichha arumax ukham arumaw utjäna.
But how long does he have?.	Ukampis ¿qhawqha tiempos jupajj utji?.
So that’s just it.	Ukhamajj ukakiw.
I've been feeling that way.	Nayajj ukham amuyasta.
Now he’s happy.	Jichhax jupax kusisitaw jikxatasi.
And now you know .	Ukat jichhax jumax yatisktawa .
It’s not like that again.	Janiw mayamp ukhamäkiti.
Really, .	Chiqpachansa, .
There’s no way you can say it’s not.	Janiw kunjamatsa janiw ukhamäkiti sañjamäkiti.
That will do it for me.	Ukaw nayatakejj lurani.
I just did things as soon as I knew how.	Kunjamsa uk yatkayäta ukhamakiw kuns lurayäta.
In fact, he really gave it to me.	Chiqansa, jupax chiqpachapuniw nayar churitu.
I know all the words well.	Nayajj taqe arunak sum yatta.
And it doesn’t really matter.	Ukat janiw chiqpachapunix kunäkisa.
I don’t think anyone did.	Nayax janiw khitis ukham lurkänti.
Today, however, this is not the case.	Ukampis jichhürunakanxa, janiw ukax askïkiti.
And it certainly looks that way.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukham uñnaqaniwa.
And things somehow look really good.	Ukat kunanakas kunjamatsa chiqpachansa wali suma uñtasi.
And he said something very strange.	Ukat jupax wali muspharkañ arunak arsüna.
I asked what time it was.	Ukat kuna horasas uk jisktʼta.
And of course, a cold beer.	Ukat chiqansa, mä thaya cerveza.
I didn’t know how to let it go.	Janiw kunjamsa uk jaytañ yatkayätti.
Both of them, actually.	Panpachaniw, chiqpachansa.
You don’t want to get involved.	Jumax janiw ukar mantañ munktati.
He didn't want any more beer.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp cerveza munkänti.
Eventually, he fell in love with me, too.	Qhepatjja, jupajj nayamp wal munasïna, ukhamaraki.
He did what he wanted to do.	Kuntï lurañ munkäna uk luräna.
And he wanted to talk to her.	Ukat jupampiw parltʼañ munäna.
I didn't know how to do anything about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa kun lurañsa janiw yatkayätti.
One thing is clear.	Mä tuqitxa qhanaw amuyasi.
So it happens so many times.	Ukhamajj ukham walja kutiw pasaspa.
I really love that.	Chiqpachansa nayax uk walpun munta.
The weather was nice and pleasant at the time .	Pachax wali suma ukat sumaw uka pachanx .
I want to go with him.	Jupampiw sarañ munta.
I’m undecided at the moment.	Nayax jichha pachanx janiw amtkti.
He’s quiet now.	Jupax jichhax amukiw jikxatasi.
He wanted a cigar more than anything.	Jupajj taqe kunat sipansa, mä cigarro wal munäna.
He hasn't done that in a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan ukham lurkiti.
So you never know.	Ukhamajj janipuniw yatkayätati.
He started this place.	Jupaw aka chiqar qalltäna.
I want an equally rich man.	Nayax mä pachpa qamir jaqiruw munta.
Or longer, maybe longer.	Jan ukajj jukʼamp jaya, inas jukʼamp jaya tiempo.
I didn't want to do that at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, janiw ukanak lurañ munkayätti.
Maybe one day, but not today.	Inas mä urux, ukampis janiw jichha urux ukhamäkiti.
It is what he has always wanted.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj nayratpach munkäna ukawa.
But he leaves her alone.	Ukampis jupajj sapak jaytawayi.
More than that, it was delicious.	Ukat sipansa, wali sumapunïnwa.
He didn’t want to tell me anything else.	Jupax janiw yaqha tuqit yatiyañ munkänti.
There’s something more.	Ukax kunas juk’ampi utji.
I know why it exists.	Kunatsa ukajj utji uk sum yatta.
He told me the local car the next day.	Jupax qhipürux uka markan autop yatiyäna.
I’m not going to do that for any reason.	Nayax janiw kunatsa ukham lurkäti.
He’s very strong about it.	Jupax wali ch’amampiw uka tuqitx arsu.
She gave me some homework to do which was nice.	Jupax mä juk’a tareanak lurañatakiw churitu ukax wali sumapunïnwa.
He’s a great guy and a teacher.	Jupax wali jach’a jaqiwa ukat yatichiriwa.
Of course he was very happy.	Chiqansa jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Janiw jan wal lurañ munkayätti.
These were the things that spoke to me.	Ukanakaw nayar parläna.
Yes, it happened again.	Jïsa, wasitatwa pasäna.
Actually, more lunch.	Chiqansa, juk’ampi chika uru.
I really can't figure it out.	Chiqpachansa janiw uk amuytʼirjamäkti.
Now it's even worse.	Jichhax juk'amp jan waliw uñjasi.
I know exactly what he is saying.	Kuntï siski uk sum yatta.
That’s how it all came.	Ukhamaw taqi kunas purinïna.
But it took years.	Ukampis walja maranakaw munasïna.
I feel good about doing good things!.	¡Suma lurañanak lurasajj wali sumaw jikjjatasta!.
He took out twenty.	Jupax pä tunk apsüna.
He’s spent a lot of time in the house, now.	Jupax walja pachaw uka utan sarnaqäna, jichhax.
You know, you can do it.	Jumax yatisktawa, jumax uk lurañ yatta.
I want that chance.	Nayax uka ch’am munta.
He has no idea how to do that.	Jupajj kunjamsa uk luraspa uk janiw amuykiti.
They look amazing.	Ukanakajj muspharkañ uñnaqaniwa.
That is already happening.	Ukajj niyaw ukham luraski.
He died soon afterwards.	Uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw jiwjjäna.
I like to ride.	Nayax kayuk sarañax wali askiwa.
He could have done what he had to do.	Jupajj kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luraspänwa.
This is the snowflake.	Akax ch’uqi satawa.
He was pretty much alone, working with me.	Jupax niya sapakiw jikxatasïna, nayamp chikaw irnaqäna.
It needs to be repeated.	Ukax wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
It will take a day or two.	Mä uru jan ukajj pä uruw pasani.
These were all excellent.	Ukanakajj taqe kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
It’s just arrived.	Ukax jichhakiw purini.
I see no reason not to do so.	Janiw kuna razonas jan ukham lurañatak uñjkti.
He is a good teacher.	Jupajj suma yatichiriwa.
I was very surprised.	Nayajj uk walpun muspharta.
Cold or hot.	Thaya jan ukax junt’u.
You don’t matter at that point.	Jumax uka pachanx janiw kunäkisa.
It was a perfect day for riding.	Uka urux kayuk sarañatakix wali sumapunïnwa.
If you have a room.	Ukaxa mä cuarto ukhamawa.
He wanted it from me.	Jupajj nayat walpun munäna.
I think he’s doing well with me.	Nayax amuyta, jupax nayamp sum sarnaqaski.
Many times over the years.	Walja maranakaw walja kuti.
I will go to him every day.	Nayajj sapa uruw jupan ukar sarä.
He began to preach very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa yatiyañ qalltäna.
I always see it in the same place.	Sapa kutiw pachpa chiqan uñjta.
There is no reason for this.	Ukajj janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
I think he wanted to see it.	Jupajj uñjañ munäna sasaw amuyta.
Too little, too little something.	Sinti jisk’a, sinti jisk’a kuna.
He’s available all day.	Jupax taqi uruw utji.
I have no idea what happened to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasäna uk janiw amuykti.
That’s the reason for the perilous time.	Ukaw kunatsa uka jan walt’äwin pachax utji.
A big, big chunk of it.	Mä jach’a, jach’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Who wants to play me tomorrow?.	¿Khitis qharürojj nayar anattʼañ muni?.
¡This is a very good one!.	¡Akax wali askiwa!.
He wants to come see you.	Jupajj jumar uñjir jutañ muni.
And that yes.	Ukat uka jïsa.
I had never thought of it that way before.	Janiw nayrajj ukham amuyirïkti.
I have no idea how he knew about me.	Kunjamsa nayat yatïna uk janiw amuykti.
No one can do that now.	Jichhax janiw khitis ukham lurkaspati.
I don't think he did.	Janiw ukham lurkänti sasaw amuyta.
You do time in jail.	Jumax carcelan tiempo lurañamawa.
He needed her to do it.	Uk lurañatakejj jupaw munasïna.
It is rare to build a new house.	Mä machaq uta lurañax jukʼakiw utji.
Breakfast may be served in the bedroom.	Desayuno ukax inas ikiñ uta manqhan manq’añax wakischispa.
Maybe he means what he says.	Inas kuntï siski uk sañ munpachäna.
No one does that really.	Janiw khitis ukham lurkiti chiqpachansa.
It’s fun, actually.	Ukax kusiskañawa, chiqpachansa.
It hit him harder.	Juparux juk’amp ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
No one here knows what happened to him.	Kunatï jupar paskäna uk janiw khitis akan yatkiti.
I told everyone.	Taqiniruw sista.
The process took three years.	Uka lurañatakejj kimsa maraw munasïna.
You will have to do it all over again.	Taqi ukanak wasitat lurañaw wakisini.
Every day there will be something new.	Sapa uruw kuna machaq lurañas utjani.
It’s Christmas Eve.	Navidad urux wali ch’amawa.
And that’s the key to all of this.	Ukat ukax taqi ukanak lurañatakix wali wakiskiriwa.
I went to every cafe in town.	Nayax markan sapa café ukar sarawayta.
Or he could have done it.	Jan ukajj luraspänwa.
He seemed to be a very tall man.	Jupajj wali jachʼa jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
This is not what I expected.	Ukajj janiw kunjamtï suykayäta ukhamäkiti.
He’s done a wonderful job.	Jupax wali suma irnaqäw lurawayi.
He has me, I don’t need him.	Jupax nayaruw utjitu, janiw juparux munaskiti.
In fact, I am very happy about it.	Chiqansa, uka tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
You know, .	Yattati, .
I mean real bad stuff.	Chiqpach jan walinak sañ munta.
We don’t have the time.	Jiwasax janiw kuna pachas utjkiti.
I know it’s not good enough yet.	Nayax yattwa janiw jichhakamax askïkiti.
This is not about money.	Ukax janiw qullqi tuqitx utjkiti.
But he’s really worried.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachansa llakitaw jikxatasi.
Too much or otherwise.	Sinti jan ukax yaqha ukhama.
But it was later.	Ukampis qhepat ukhamänwa.
Difficult, but not impossible.	Ch’amawa, ukampis janiw jan lurañjamäkiti.
I’m going to be like that too.	Nayax ukhamarakiw ukham sarnaqañ amtasta.
He knew more than I did, it turned out.	Jupax nayat sipan juk’amp yatïna, ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
And yesterday .	Ukat qharüruw .
Then I decided to leave.	Ukat sarxañ amtawayta.
It was a vibrant life.	Ukajj wali chʼamampiw jakasïna.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ukham jan wali lurañax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti.
How everything comes to him so fast.	Kunjamsa taqe kunas jupar jankʼak puri.
But, he was wonderful.	Ukampis, jupajj wali sumapunïnwa.
It has a place of its own.	Jupa pachpaw mä chiqaw utji.
I just saw this happen the other day.	Jichhakiw yaqha urux ukham luraskäna uk uñjta.
Because he’s totally doing that.	Kunatix jupax taqpach ukham luraski.
There is nothing like that.	Janiw kunas ukham lurkiti.
He used to get in three days.	Jupajj kimsa uruw ukar mantañ yatïna.
I have no idea what this is.	Nayax janiw kunas akax ukx amuykti.
Everyone means well.	Taqinipuniw sum sañ muni.
So don't forget!.	Ukhamajj ¡jan armasimti!.
He said the words.	Jupaw uka arunak säna.
The man doesn't do anything.	Chachax janiw kuns lurkiti.
I happened to be right.	Nayax chiqaw sasaw pasäna.
You’re right in the country.	Jumax chiqaw uka markan jikxatasïta.
I’ve never seen him like this.	Janipuniw jupar ukham uñjkti.
I didn't do these things.	Janiw nayajj ukanak lurkti.
So he can do anything.	Ukhamajj kuns luraspa.
It’s so understandable!.	¡Walpun amuyasi!.
In fact, he was disappointed.	Chiqansa, jupax llakitaw jikxatasïna.
He loved her right there.	Jupajj uka markanwa jupar munasïna.
But he can definitely do it all.	Ukampis jupax chiqpachapuniw taqi ukanak luraspa.
But he didn't do it the way he wanted to.	Ukampis janiw kunjamtï munkäna ukham lurkänti.
He was a little hungry.	Jupax mä juk’a manq’at awtjataw jikxatasïna.
He longed to see her again.	Jupajj wasitat uñjañ wal munäna.
And he could do it.	Ukat jupax uk luraspänwa.
And you came yesterday.	Ukat jumax qharüruw jutta.
Part of another thing.	Yaqha tuqit mä chiqa.
And he loved it.	Ukat jupajj uk walpun munäna.
He returned to it ten years later.	Tunka mara qhepatwa uka toqet kuttʼjjäna.
He shook one off.	Jupax mä ch’allxtayäna.
But that's all they have.	Ukampis ukakiw jupanakajj utji.
Of course there isn’t.	Chiqansa janiw utjkiti.
Today, that is a good thing.	Jichhürunakanjja, ukajj wali sumawa.
It was obvious that he didn't like me.	Jupajj janiw nayar gustkituti ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
All of this is obvious.	Taqi ukanakax qhanaw amuyasi.
And more needed to be done.	Ukat jukʼamp lurañaw wakisïna.
He didn’t eat breakfast this morning.	Jupax jichha alwax janiw desayuno manq’añax utjkänti.
He is doing very well now.	Jichhajj wali sum luraski.
The boy meant no problem.	Uka waynax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis sañ munkänti.
Maybe it's ??? 	Inas ukax ???
It doesn’t do much.	Janiw walpun lurkiti.
He wants to talk.	Parlañ muni.
But it will happen later.	Ukampis qhepatwa ukajj pasani.
Now or else .	Jichhax jan ukax .
Like you mean it.	Kunjamtï jumax sañ munkta ukhama.
Do this at least three times.	Kimsa kutis ukham lurañamawa.
I can’t tell you.	Nayax janiw sañjamäkiti.
That’s the kind of person.	Ukax uka kasta jaqiwa.
And if you have some time, do it again.	Ukat mä juk’a pachax utjki ukhax wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
There you have it.	Ukanjja jumaw utji.
In that respect, it’s fine.	Uka tuqitxa, walikïskiwa.
Let me know how this goes.	Kunjams akax saraski uk yatiyapxita.
He preferred it anyway.	Jupajj kunjamatsa uk jukʼamp munäna.
He can’t do anything.	Jupax janiw kuns lurkaspati.
But he never mentioned her name.	Ukampis janipuniw sutip arskänti.
So no that doesn't matter to me.	Ukhamajj janiw ukajj nayatakejj janiw kunäkisa.
It’s also very useful.	Ukhamaraki wali askiwa.
I was the last person to see him.	Nayaw qhep qhepa jaqejj jupar uñjta.
But the weather was not.	Ukampis tiempojj janiw ukhamäkänti.
Another beautiful scene.	Yaqha suma uñtatawa.
I want to be completely honest about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx taqpach chiqapar sarnaqañ munta.
I feel that way every morning.	Sapa alwaw ukham amuyasta.
The man was short and ugly.	Uka jaqejj jiskʼa jaqënwa ukat jan wali jaqënwa.
He’s on his own at the moment.	Jupax jichha pachanx sapakiw jikxatasi.
He didn’t want that and he was happy.	Jupax janiw uk munkänti ukat jupax kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He said another little thing.	Jupax yaqha jisk’a arunak arsüna.
He wasn't sure who he thought would do it.	Khitis uk lurani sasin amuyäna uk janiw sum yatkänti.
No human being can do that.	Janiw khitis jaqix ukham lurkaspati.
He knew that was the best part of him.	Ukajj jupat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa, uk jupajj sum yatïna.
He thought he would never do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurkäti sasaw amuyäna.
What no one else says is irrelevant.	Kuntï jan khitis siski ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
That's more than enough for me.	Ukajj nayatakejj jukʼampiw utji.
He’s really because he’s famous, or infamous.	Jupax chiqpachansa kunatix wali uñt’atawa, jan ukax jan wali uñt’atawa.
You want to control everything you see.	Jumax taqi kunatix uñjkta ukanak apnaqañ munta.
I wholeheartedly refused.	Nayajj taqe chuymaw jan munkti.
Well, let me know when I need to do something.	Ukhama, kunapachatï kuns lurañax wakisispa uk yatiyapxita.
Maybe two days.	Inas pä uru.
They have nothing yet.	Jupanakax janiw kunas jichhakamax utjkiti.
I was afraid of me too.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw nayar ajjsarayäta.
There is a very nice view.	Ukanx wali sumaw uñjasi.
I think maybe you should go home.	Nayax amuyta inas jumax utar sarañax wakischispa.
Not until tomorrow.	Janiw qhipürux ukhamäkiti.
But I don't remember much about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet wal amtaskti.
This is good, this is beautiful.	Akax wali askiwa, akax wali sumawa.
I never found anything.	Janipuniw kuns jikxatkti.
He worked quickly.	Jupajj jankʼakiw irnaqäna.
It was in the old town.	Ukajj nayra markanwa utjäna.
Not in a remote location.	Janiw mä jaya cheqan utjkiti.
Or whatever it may be.	Jan ukajj kunanakas utjaspa.
I especially love how it feels good.	Kunjamsa ukajj wali askïspa uk jukʼamp munasta.
I saw the opportunity.	Nayax uka oportunidad uñjta.
I’ve never seen so much water before.	Janiw nayrax ukham walja uma uñjkti.
But that is coming soon.	Ukampis ukajj niyaw purini.
But, for me .	Ukampis, nayatakejj .
I wasn’t expecting anyone to drive me.	Janiw khitirus autot sarañ suykayätti.
He did it anyway.	Jupax kunjamatsa uk luräna.
So let’s actually do that.	Ukhamajj uk cheqpachapun lurañäni.
He can do just that .	Jupajj ukhamakiw luraspa .
He certainly knew that fact.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheq yatïna.
It seemed like a bad person.	Ukajj jan wali jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
He didn’t know, he didn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkänti, janiw yatkänti.
So do it again.	Ukhamajj mayamp luram.
Anywhere faster.	Kawkhansa juk’ampi jaya.
He was unsure for a while.	Jupajj mä qhawqha tiempow jan sum yatkänti.
But she knew he didn't like it.	Ukampis jupajj janiw gustkänti uk sum yatïna.
The living space.	Uka jakañ chiqa.

He looks like he wants to say something.	Jupajj kuns sañ munkaspa ukham uñnaqaniwa.
well, that’s what it is.	suma, ukax ukhamawa.
Importantly, he did it.	Wali wakiskiriwa, jupaw uk luräna.
And so beautiful .	Ukat ukhama suma .
It feels safe, but a little weird.	Ukax jan kuna jan walt’äwin jikxatasi, ukampis mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
Please tell me the truth.	Mä juk’a chiqa yatiyapxita.
I’m going to quit.	Nayax jaytañ amtasta.
You don’t have to do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañanak lurañamäkiti.
I said there isn’t.	Nayax janiw utjkiti sasaw sista.
There is only what is.	Kunatï utjki ukakiw utji.
But he didn't want to do that either.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañsa munkänti.
Another power I have.	Yaqha ch’amaw nayan utjitu.
It’s also a bad thing.	Ukhamaraki jan wali.
That’s all we have for you right now.	Ukakiw jichhax jumatakix utjistu.
He had nothing to do, nothing to do, and nothing to do.	Jupajj janiw kuntï lurañ munkänti, jan kuns lurañ munkäna ukat jan kuns lurañ munkänti.
You are a money man.	Jumax qullqi jaqiwa.
I see her in the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jupar uñjta.

There is more work for you to do.	Jumatakejj jukʼamp lurañaw utji.
Same old food.	Pachpa nayra manq’a.
It was not very one-sided.	Ukajj janiw sinti mä cheqan utjkänti.
But there was a glimmer of light.	Ukampis mä jiskʼa qhanaw utjäna.
You may feel that the money is worth it.	Inas uka qullqix wali askïkaspas ukham amuyasta.
Thank you so much for that .	Uka tuqitxa walpun yuspärta .
I don't see a problem with that.	Janiw uka toqet mä jan waltʼäw uñjkti.
Everything else is good as well.	Taqi kunas wali askiwa ukhamaraki.
You can’t do my thing.	Jumax janiw nayan lurañjamäkiti.
I promised to marry her.	Jupampiw casarasiñatak arsuwayta.
This can be just as effective.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw wali askïspa.
No, he's a slow mover.	Janiwa, jupajj siwa.
He certainly could have avoided the latter.	Jupajj cheqapuniw qhep qhepa lurañanak jan lurkaspänti.
And a long one.	Ukat mä jaya.
Everything arrived perfectly.	Taqi kunas wali sumaw purinïna.
Now I am not saying anything that is not true.	Jichhajj janiw kunatï jan cheqäki uk siskti.
But it took a while to get going.	Ukampis mä jukʼa tiempow sarañatak munasïna.
But, always, the old ones are better.	Ukampis, sapa kuti, nayra jaqinakax juk’amp askiwa.
Thank you all so much.	Taqi jupanakar walpun yuspärta.
Very soft and smooth.	Wali llamp’u ukat suma.
He thought it wasn't.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyäna.
I will never buy this product again.	Nayax janiw mayamps aka yänak alañ munkti.
So far this has been good.	Jichhakamax akax wali askiwa.
Christmas or no Christmas.	Navidad jan ukax jan Navidad.
He had done it twice.	Jupajj pä kutiw uk luratayna.
It felt better alone.	Ukajj sapakiw jukʼamp sum jikjjatasïna.
I didn't want to know about it.	Janiw uka toqet yatiñ munkayätti.
So he did something wrong.	Ukatwa jupajj jan walinak luräna.
Where, no one knows.	Kawkitsa, janiw khitis yatkiti.
It was all he wanted, really.	Ukajj taqe kuntï jupajj munkäna ukawa, cheqapuniw ukham luräna.
It happened for many years.	Walja maranakaw ukham pasäna.
No one knows what to do.	Janiw khitis kun lurañsa yatkiti.
You do the work yourself.	Jumaw lurañanak lurasma.
It arrived beautifully.	Ukax wali sumaw purinïna.
A rebuild is required.	Mä wasitat lurañaw wakisi.
He thought he was someone else.	Jupajj yaqha jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.

I want to buy everything and everyone.	Nayax taqi kuna ukat taqiniruw alañ munta.

Or maybe you .	Jan ukajj inas jumajj .
But he has so much more.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼampiw utji.
I saw this yesterday.	Nayax qharüruw uk uñjta.
But he looked at her again and again.	Ukampis walja kutiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
He sat there for a long time.	Jupajj wali jaya tiempow ukan qontʼasïna.
Or so he thought now.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa jichhajj amuyäna.
Overall, that seemed to work for me.	Taqi kunat sipansa, ukax nayatakix wali askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
So I decided to go out on my own.	Ukatwa naya pachpa mistuñ amtawayta.
And that happens all the time.	Ukat ukajj sapa kutiw pasaspa.
This happened a few times.	Ukajj mä qhawqha kutiw pasäna.
He was not entirely right.	Jupajj janiw taqe chuyma cheq siskänti.
I hope he’s cool.	Nayax suyt’twa jupax wali ch’amawa.
How it all happened.	Kunjamsa taqe kunas pasäna.
I want to be him every day.	Nayax sapa uruw jupar tukuñ munta.
He thinks he can do it.	Uk lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa amuyi.
And, above all else .	Ukat, taqi kunat sipansa .
This will take years.	Ukatakejj walja maranakaw pasani.
But not all of this was in the future.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kunas jutïrin utjkänti.
We’ll see how and why later.	Kunjamsa ukat kunatsa uk qhepat uñjañäni.
But now they are nothing.	Ukampis jichhajj janiw jupanakajj kunäkisa.
He didn't know he could do that.	Ukham luraspa uk janiw yatkänti.
That was a little surprising.	Ukaw mä jukʼa muspharäna.
Not for me anymore.	Janiw nayatakix juk’ampi.
It is a kind of .	Ukajj mä kasta .
Ten years ago and.	Tunka maraw ukat.
I know I can take something from that.	Nayax uka tuqit kuns apsuñ yatta.
There is awesome winemaking here.	Aka chiqanx wali muspharkañ vino lurañaw utji.
I am so worried about him.	Nayajj jupat wal llakista.
It’s not like that, that’s ever.	Janiw ukax ukhamäkiti, ukax kunapachas.
Please let me know if it works.	Ukax wali askiwa sasaw yatiyapxita.
In fact, it is very rare.	Chiqansa, wali jukʼakiw.
He told me almost immediately.	Jupajj niya jankʼakiw sitäna.
It’s really like that.	Chiqpachansa ukhama.
I can’t remember his name at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw sutip amtaskti.
But it doesn’t really matter.	Ukampis janiw cheqpachapun kunäkisa.
It just happens to be.	Ukajj ukhamakiw utji.
Dinner that evening would be nice.	Uka jayp’ux manq’añax wali askïspawa.
Certainly and.	Chiqpachansa ukat.
It lay quietly inside him.	Ukajj jupan manqhan amukiw ikiskäna.
I knew nothing about it.	Ukanakat janiw kunatsa yatkayätti.
I didn’t tell him.	Nayax janiw juparux siskti.
And this is still happening to me.	Ukat akax nayatakix waliw pasaski.
And there will be something, there will be.	Ukat kunas utjani, utjani.
That doesn’t mean that.	Ukax janiw ukham sañ munkiti.
I loved that so much.	Nayax uk walpun munasta.
It has everything you could want.	Ukanjja, taqe kunatï munkta ukanakaw utji.
I did all the work.	Nayajj taqe lurañanak lurayäta.
He said it was important.	Jupax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw säna.
I know this is very difficult.	Nayax yattwa akax wali ch’amawa.
But that didn't hurt.	Ukampis ukajj janiw jan walinak lurkänti.
It has nothing to do with me now.	Jichhajj janiw nayampejj kuna lurañas utjkiti.
She rolled her eyes in excitement.	Wali kusisitaw nayranakap ch’allxtayäna.
He was right about me.	Jupajj nayat cheqapuniw parläna.
Nobody does anything right.	Janiw khitis kuns sum lurkiti.
I’ve been putting this thing off for a while.	Nayax mä juk’a pachaw aka yänak jaytawayta.
He was right there.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uka cheqan jikjjatasïna.
I told him to do it.	Nayax luram sasaw sista.
Or anywhere, for that matter.	Jan ukax kawkhans, uka tuqitxa.
One day maybe but not right now.	Mä urux inas ukampis jichhax janiw ukhamäkiti.
But it’s still winter.	Ukampis juyphi pachax wali ch’amawa.
It’s hard to do that.	Uka lurañax ch’amawa.
And an amazing one.	Ukat mä muspharkañ mä.
I said he was, but really .	Nayax jupaw sista, ukampis chiqpachansa .
And so on and so forth.	Ukat ukham ukat ukham.
And he told me they all knew.	Ukat jupax taqiniw yatipxi sasaw sitäna.
I guess that’s not what you want.	Nayax amuyta, janiw ukax kuntix jumax munkta ukhamäkiti.
He doesn't need that.	Jupajj janiw ukajj wakiskiti.
I think it’s funny.	Nayax amuyta, wali muspharkañawa.
Two days, maybe three .	Pä uru, inas kimsa uru .
I had no future.	Nayajj janiw jutïrin utjkänti.
I struggled for a while.	Mä jukʼa tiempow chʼamachasiyäta.
He saw it there himself, he says.	Jupa pachpaw ukan uñjäna, sasaw saraki.
That doesn’t mean you actually use it.	Ukax janiw chiqpachapuni apnaqañ sañ munkiti.
He wondered what could have happened to him.	Kunas jupar pasaspa sasaw amuyäna.
And that is how he felt.	Ukat ukhamwa jupajj jikjjatasïna.
I know it wasn’t necessary.	Nayax yattwa janiw ukax wakiskänti.
What's the reason.	Kunas kunatsa.
Always has and always will.	Sapa kutiw utji ukat ukhamarakiw utjani.
That’s it, that’s all it says.	Ukax ukhamawa, ukax taqpach sañ muni.
He stared, not understanding.	Jupajj uñchʼukiskäna, janiw amuykänti.
I think winter is the best time to do this.	Nayatakix juyphi pachax uka lurañatakix wali askiwa.
I never liked to do that.	Janipuniw ukham lurañajj gustkituti.
Maybe I should do it later.	Inas qhepat lurañajj wakischispa.
One day I got a letter from him.	Mä urux jupat mä carta jutäna.
I think he was sincere.	Jupajj taqe chuyma jaqënwa sasaw amuyta.
And now he can do it.	Ukat jichhax jupax luraspawa.
A week went by, and he talked about you so many times.	Mä semanaw pasäna, ukat walja kutiw jumat parläna.
Well, that’s not really much.	Ukhama, ukax janiw chiqpachapunix walïkiti.
¡That was wonderful!.	¡Ukax wali sumapunïnwa!.
She felt that this could be her.	Ukaw jupajj utjaspa sasaw jupajj amuyasïna.
I told him this.	Nayax juparux akham sasaw sista.
So I bought it once.	Ukhamajj mä kutikiw alasïna.
These he received.	Ukanak jupajj katoqäna.
He was secretive and fast.	Jupajj jamasat ukat jankʼakiw sarnaqäna.
He doesn’t want to talk about it on the phone.	Jupax janiw uka tuqit telefonot parlañ munkiti.
There is almost none.	Niya janiw utjkiti.
I had no idea how to do that.	Ukham lurañatakejj janiw amuykayätti.
He still wants to learn.	Jupax wali yatiqañ munaraki.
And he asked what it was.	Ukat kunas ukajj sasaw jisktʼäna.
It will go well tonight.	Jichha arumax wali sum sarxani.
Brothers are still important.	Jilatanakajj wali wakiskiriwa.
But while it was happening, it was still .	Ukampis ukham luraskäna ukhajja, wali .
But he knew that this was all possible.	Ukampis ukham lurañajj taqe kunas utjaspa uk jupajj sum yatïna.
Now I know about you.	Jichhajj jumat yattwa.
He didn't feel that way right now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj ukham amuyaskänti.
But here’s what I want to say.	Ukampis akham sañ munta.
And it never was.	Ukat janipuniw utjkänti.
No one said anything it was silent.	Janiw khitis kuns arskänti ukax amukiw jikxatasïna.
Something had to be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa kuns lurañaw wakisïna.
In modern times, it was.	Jichha tiemponjja, ukhamänwa.
I don't know how that works.	Kunjamsa ukajj irnaqäna uk janiw yatkti.
But he was still alone that night.	Ukampis uka arumax wali sapakiw jikxatasïna.
Or he thought he meant himself.	Jan ukajj jupa pachpaw sañ muni sasaw amuyäna.
It’s so nice, it’s so nice.	Ukhama wali sumawa, ukhama wali sumawa.
The man loved money.	Uka jaqejj qollqe wal munasïna.
And he needed more for it.	Ukat ukatakix jukʼampiw munasïna.
I want to know .	Nayax yatiñ munta .
I had no idea how I felt.	Kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk janiw kuns amuykayätti.
Very nice surprise.	Wali suma muspharkañawa.
A very good beer.	Mä wali suma cerveza.
One day you will too.	Mä urux ukhamarakiw jumax lurasma.
Also because he can do it.	Ukhamaraki kunatix jupax luraspawa.
A man she wanted.	Mä chacharuw jupax munäna.
And that’s all that happened here.	Ukat ukakiw akan pasäna.
But often they don’t know how.	Ukampis walja kutiw kunjamsa uk jan yatipkiti.
So it doesn't mean much more than that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkiti.
They have the same kind of day.	Jupanakax pachpa kasta uruw utji.
I just want one.	Mä sapakiw munta.
I felt comfortable with both.	Nayax panpachaniw sum jikxatasiyäta.
You have nothing to do here.	Jumax janiw kuna lurañas akan utjkiti.
It needs to be better.	Ukax juk’amp sumaw wakisi.
He loved me so much.	Jupajj walpun nayar munäna.
That, and away.	Uka, ukat jaya.
He doesn’t go without me.	Jupax janiw nayamp jan sarkiti.
Don’t drop out of school.	Janiw yatiqañ uta jaytañamäkiti.
It’s what you think it isn’t.	Ukax kuntix jumax amuyki ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
Because I understand what you want.	Kunatix jumax munkta uk amuyta.
There are never many people.	Janipuniw walja jaqenakajj utjkiti.
That’s something he’s never been able to tolerate.	Ukax janiw kunapachas jupax aguantañjamäkiti.
It will do just fine.	Ukajj wali sumwa lurani.
But he couldn’t let go.	Ukampis janiw jaytañ puedkänti.
Really, really weird.	Chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa muspharkañawa.
You know what he said.	Kuntï siskäna uk jumajj yatisktawa.
Are you comfortable with that.	¿Uka tuqit sumti jikxatasïta.
It felt like that.	Ukajj ukham jikjjatasïna.
Where does he meet.	Kawkhansa jupax uñt’asi.
I hope you enjoyed it.	Nayax suyt’twa jumax kusisitaw jikxatasïta.
She sat up and he did the same.	Jupajj qontʼasïna ukat jupajj ukhamarakiw qontʼasïna.
It was up to me.	Ukajj nayaruw utjäna.
He was a good speaker.	Jupajj sum parlañ yatïna.
And why should he do that.	Ukat kunatsa ukham lurañapa.
So he went and started using it.	Ukatwa saräna ukat uka apnaqañ qalltäna.
I have no idea how to do this.	Nayax janiw kunjams uk lurañax ukx amuykti.
They were still they were.	Wali wali wali.
It looks good on her and she loves it.	Juparux wali suma uñtatawa ukat jupax walpun munasi.
Definitely why not.	Chiqpachansa kunatsa jan ukhamäki.
You’re in a bit of a predicament.	Jumax mä juk’a jan walt’äwin jikxatastaxa.
No, it’s too soon.	Janiwa, wali jank’akiw.
He wanted it himself.	Jupa pachpaw uk munäna.
But it still felt good.	Ukampis wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
He was already in a bad mood.	Jupajj niyaw jan walin jikjjatasïna.
I focus on that.	Ukaruw chuym churta.
I don’t want to know about it.	Nayax janiw uka tuqit yatxatañ munkti.
I saw this for the first time last night.	Nayax nayrïr kutiw qhipa arumax uk uñjta.
I felt really strongly.	Chiqpachansa wali chʼamampiw ukham jikxatasiyäta.
He accepted the facts.	Jupajj kunatï cheqäki uk katoqäna.
That is not right for us to do.	Uk lurañajj jiwasajj janiw walïkiti.
The man didn't know.	Uka jaqejj janiw yatkänti.
Of course, he had no idea.	Chiqansa, jupax janiw kuns amuykänti.
I feel like it could take years.	Ukajj walja maranakaw munasispa sasaw amuyasta.
I know that’s hard for you.	Nayax yattwa ukax jumatakix ch’amawa.
This is beautiful, this is exciting.	Akax wali sumawa, akax wali kusiskañawa.
A little bit of a bad thing.	Mä juk’a jan wali.
So you can do that many times.	Ukhamajj walja kutiw ukham lurasma.
There is no telling what could happen.	Kunas pasaspa uk janiw sañjamäkiti.
That speed is vital.	Uka jankʼak lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Very far indeed.	Wali jaya chiqpachansa.
Let’s do something great.	Mä jach’a lurañanak lurañäni.
He came to see me again.	Jupajj wasitatwa nayar uñjir jutäna.
I do it all the time at this point.	Nayax sapa kutiw aka pachanx luraskta.
And I really can't say anything.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw kuns sañjamäkiti.
But he was a foreigner.	Ukampis jupajj yaqha markankir jaqënwa.
He talked somehow.	Jupax kunjamatsa parläna.
Not much can be done about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw sinti lurañax utjkaspati.
Of course, he was hungry.	Chiqansa, jupax manqʼat awtjataw jikxatasïna.
I didn’t want to give it up.	Janiw uk jaytañ munkayätti.
I have done the wrong thing.	Nayajj jan walinak lurawayta.
I’m going to give up a bit.	Nayax mä juk’a jaytañ munta.
Let’s see why here.	Kunatsa uk aka chiqan uñjañäni.
It really didn’t matter.	Chiqpachansa, janiw kunas wakiskänti.
Now, he’s very happy.	Jichhax, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
And the coffee here is delicious.	Ukat aka chiqan café ukax wali sumawa.
I mean that scary.	Nayax uka axsarkañ sañ munta.
And he’s definitely done it.	Ukat jupax chiqpachapuniw lurawayi.
Of course this is not the case.	Chiqansa akax janiw ukhamäkiti.
So, so quiet .	Ukhama, ukhama amukiw .
That seems to be the most useful to me.	Ukajj nayatakejj jukʼamp askïkaspas ukhamawa.
One day I saw him inside for a long time.	Mä urux juparux wali jaya pachaw manqhan uñjta.
There wasn’t a lot of money around, to be honest.	Janiw walja qullqix uka jak’an utjkänti, chiqaw sañ muni.
I think it’s important.	Nayax wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyasta.
Or so the man thought.	Jan ukajj ukhamwa uka jaqejj amuyäna.
He looks more mature.	Jupax juk’amp jilïr uñnaqaniwa.
He loved it, and he loved it more.	Jupajj walpun munäna, ukatwa jukʼamp munasïna.
I don't think so at all.	Nayajj janiw kunjamatsa ukham amuykti.
They had no one.	Jupanakajj janiw khitis utjkänti.
Someone we all love.	Maynix taqiniw munasispa.
Winter was the best of all.	Juyphi pachax taqi kunat sipansa wali sumapunïnwa.
After all there are no villains.	Taqi kunat sipansa janiw jan wali jaqinakax utjkiti.
But it is not by any means.	Ukampis janiw kuna tuqitsa ukhamäkiti.
And then immediately again.	Ukat ukat jankʼakiw wasitat.
It was a week-long thing.	Ukajj mä semanan mä kunaw utjäna.
But he never said no.	Ukampis janipuniw janiw siskänti.
I want this so bad.	Nayax akax wali jan waliw munta.
But it can never last that long.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham jaya tiempojj utjkaspati.
Let’s see this time around.	Aka pachan uñjañäni.
I don’t agree with all of them.	Janiw taqpach jupanakar iyaw siskti.
Anything but that.	Kunas jan ukax uka.
And it looks great for you, too.	Ukat jumatakix wali sumaw uñtasi, ukhamaraki.
I want him bad enough.	Nayajj jupar jan walpun munta.
A stupid word.	Mä loqhe aru.
Every time she moved, he did the same.	Sapa kutiw jupax yaqha chiqar sarxäna, jupax ukhamarakiw sarnaqäna.
I have not seen him since.	Uka qhepatjja janiw jupar uñjkti.
But that's not what you want.	Ukampis ukajj janiw kuntï munkta ukajj ukhamäkiti.
He’s always in town.	Jupax sapa kutiw markanx utji.
He started doing it.	Uk lurañwa qalltäna.
He went further.	Jupajj jukʼampiw uka cheqar saräna.
That’s right now.	Ukax jichhax.
I did that for myself.	Nayatakix ukham lurawayta.
He did and it was a good time.	Jupax ukham luratayna ukat mä suma pachaw utjäna.
This is a non-surprise.	Ukax mä jan muspharkañawa.

Everything is good for me .	Taqi kunas nayatakix wali askiwa .
And it could be even worse.	Ukat jukʼamp jan walinak lurañaw utjaspa.
I know you don’t want it there.	Nayax yattwa jumax janiw ukan munktati.
What a fool.	Kunjamsa mä loqhe.
I actually feel better than I did yesterday morning.	Chiqansa, qharüru alwat sipansa jukʼamp sum jikxatastxa.
I might agree with that.	Nayajj inas uk iyaw sista.
It’s really nice there.	Ukanx chiqpachansa wali sumawa.
Of course, it was more of a walk.	Chiqansa, ukax jukʼampiw sarnaqäna.
The night was nice and quiet.	Uka arumax wali suma ukat amukiw jikxatasïna.
It’s beautiful but unique.	Ukax wali sumawa ukampis jan uñt’atawa.
He repeated this many times.	Ukjja walja kutiw arsüna.
But no, there was something bigger than that.	Ukampis janiw, ukat sipansa jukʼamp jachʼa kunas utjäna.
Now how long ago it seemed.	Jichhajj qawqha tiempos nayrajj ukham amuyasïna.
No, no, he has none.	Janiwa, janiwa, jupax janiw khitis utjkiti.
Amazing kind of stupid.	Muspharkañ kasta loqhe.
Something really, really great.	Kunas chiqpachansa, chiqpachansa jach’a.
He didn’t know who he was.	Jupax janiw khitïnsa uk yatkänti.
So it goes by itself.	Ukhamajj jupa pachpaw saraski.
There is no age limit.	Ukanx janiw mä marax utjkiti.
Everyone likes to do that.	Taqiniruw ukham lurañax gusti.
I told him the same thing.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw jupar sista.
That is not what we need.	Ukajj janiw jiwasajj wakiskiti.
And then, too.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, ukhamaraki.
I’m definitely here.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw akanktxa.
So at least .	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa .
He couldn't quite let go.	Jupajj janiw sum jaytañ puedkänti.
I’m serious about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx wali amuyumpiw amuyta.
He’s the ultimate good guy.	Jupax qhipa suma jaqiwa.
But at the time, no one knew.	Ukampis uka tiemponjja, janiw khitis uk yatkänti.
I always want to see this place.	Nayax sapa kutiw aka chiqar uñjañ munta.
Except he doesn’t.	Jan ukasti jupax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s time to do it.	Uka lurañ pachaw purini.
Let’s see here, he said.	Akan uñjañäni, sasaw säna.
Of course he told me about me .	Chiqansa jupax nayat yatiyäna .
And that’s not what I like.	Ukat ukax janiw nayatakix wali askïkiti.
I’ve been totally fine this whole time.	Nayax aka taqpach pachanx taqpach sumaw jikxatasiyäta.
Or the year after that.	Jan ukajj uka qhepa mara.
He just agreed to it.	Jupajj ukhamakiw iyaw säna.
You never want that to happen.	Janipuniw ukham lurasiñap munktati.
Uses it for the first time.	Nayrïr kutiw apnaqi.
It’s always a great time.	Sapa kutiw mä jach’a pachax utji.
He stole the money.	Jupajj qollqe lunthatasïna.
And he’s not the only one.	Ukat janiw jupa sapakix ukham lurkiti.
I made it seem impossible.	Ukajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamwa lurayäta.
But every one is a good time.	Ukampis sapa mayniw mä suma tiempo.
I couldn't understand anything more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns amuykayätti.
That’s what it’s supposed to be.	Ukhamaw ukax sañ muni.
That's what he did best.	Ukaw jupajj jukʼamp sum luräna.
So it’s always there.	Ukhamajj sapa kutiw utji.
So now it’s a.	Ukhamajj jichhajj mä.
I have done better.	Nayajj jukʼamp sumwa lurawayta.
But many, of course, don’t.	Ukampis walja, chiqpachansa, janiw ukhamäkiti.
Somehow everything felt wrong there.	Kunjamatsa uka chiqanx taqi kunas jan waliw jikxatasïna.
He’s the one who does all of this.	Jupaw taqe ukanak luri.
I was afraid he did.	Jupajj ukham luräna sasaw ajjsarayäta.
Because it just happened.	Kunatix ukhamakiw pasäna.
That took about a week.	Ukatakejj niya mä semanaw pasäna.
He knows exactly what he wants to do.	Kun lurañsa muni uk sum yati.
So there is no need not to do it.	Ukhamajj janiw jan lurañajj wakiskiti.
I don’t think you want to do that.	Nayax janiw ukham lurañ munktati sasaw amuyta.
I’m so sorry about that.	Nayax uka tuqitx walpun llakista.
And that’s just how it is.	Ukat ukax ukhamakiw utji.
It didn’t mean anything, really.	Janiw kuns sañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
That was my first time doing that.	Ukajj nayrïr kutiw ukham lurayäta.
It looks lovely to him.	Juparux wali munasiñampiw uñtasi.
That was all he had left.	Ukajj taqe kunaw jupatak qheparäna.
I hope to find out for myself one day.	Naya pachpaw mä urux yatxatañ suyt’askta.
I can see why he likes it.	Kunatsa jupar gusti uk sum uñjta.
It’s the first time I’ve seen it.	Nayrïr kutiw ukham uñjta.
I say that all the time.	Nayajj sapa kutiw ukham sista.
They’re not, of course.	Janiw jupanakax ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
That justified him.	Ukaw juparux chiqapar uñjäna.
But, at the time .	Ukampis, uka tiemponjja .
And people .	Ukat jaqinakax .
I know exactly what that was about.	Ukajj kuna toqet parläna uk sum yatta.
The keeper knew this for a while.	Uka uñjir jaqejj mä qhawqha tiempow uk yatïna.
Yesterday was no different.	Qharürux janiw yaqha ukhamäkänti.
I said never.	Nayax janipuniw sasaw sista.
Actually, it felt like it did.	Chiqansa, ukhamaw jikxatasïna, ukhamaw jikxatasïna.
I politely said thank you and no.	Nayax wali amuyumpiw yuspärta ukat janiw sasaw sista.
I said it myself last week.	Naya pachpaw pasïr semanan ukham sista.
That’s how people are.	Ukhamaw jaqinakax utji.
Beyond that, that's not good enough.	Ukat sipansa, ukajj janiw walïkiti.
Eventually, someone told me.	Qhepatjja, mayniw ukham sitäna.
And of course, blood.	Ukat chiqansa, wila.
That happened to me very well.	Ukax nayatakix wali sumaw pasäna.
I think he’s right about that.	Nayax amuyta, jupax chiqaw uka tuqitxa.
Don’t leave it all alone.	Janiw taqpach sapak jaytañamäkiti.
So it doesn't do that.	Ukhamajj janiw ukham lurkiti.
Or, you can do it yourself.	Jan ukajj, juma pachpaw uk lurasma.
It’s not really a bad thing, you know.	Janiw chiqpachansa jan walinak lurañjamäkiti, jumax yatisktawa.
It's amazing to me.	Nayatakejj wali muspharkañawa.
Except when you want to.	Jan ukasti kunapachatï munkta ukhaxa.
But he wasn't, he was silent.	Ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti, amukiw qheparäna.
I used to cut the snowflakes.	Nayax nayrax uka ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi ch’uqi.
I’ll take it if you like.	Nayax ukanak apsuñ munta jumatix munsta ukhaxa.
And it worked the other way around.	Ukat yaqha tuqitxa ukhamarakiw irnaqäna.
And another thing entirely.	Ukat yaqha tuqit taqpach.
But I promise you something.	Ukampis mä kun arsuwayta.
He saw the words immediately.	Uka arunak jankʼakiw uñjäna.
A true gift.	Mä chiqpach regalo.
He said it was good, it was good.	Jupax wali askiwa, wali askiwa sasaw säna.
Things are looking pretty sad.	Kunanakas wali llakitaw uñjasi.
I’ve always wanted him.	Nayax juparux sapa kutiw munta.
I personally never really compared them.	Naya pachpajj janipuniw cheqpachapun jupanakar ukham uñtasit uñjkti.
That’s fine with me, but there’s at least a time limit.	Ukax nayatakix wali askiwa, ukampis mä pachas mä chiqaw utji.
Nothing felt impossible.	Janiw kunas jan lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
The procedure is as follows.	Uka lurañax akham sañ muni.
He’s a lovely, lovely person.	Jupax wali munat, munat jaqiwa.
There is nothing good about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw kunas askïkiti.

Or there is a time limit.	Jan ukajj mä tiempow utji.
Do it for yourself and do it for yourself.	Juma pachpaw uk lurañama ukat juma pachpaw lurañama.
He could not stay still, perhaps .	Jupajj janiw wali qheparañ puedkänti, inas .

I am glad that one brother was happy.	Mä jilatajj kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj wal kusista.
Not people at all.	Janiw jaqinakax kunjamatsa.

You really don’t have to do anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuns lurañax wakiskiti.
Someone is doing very well.	Maynix wali sumwa luraski.
This is a bit of a big challenge though.	Akax mä juk’a jach’a ch’amawa ukampis.
But ultimately, he couldn't do it.	Ukampis qhepatjja, janiw uk lurañ puedkänti.

This guy is good for me.	Aka waynax nayatakix wali askiwa.

Or, it’s better for you.	Jan ukax, jumatakix juk’amp askiwa.

The question is pretty obvious.	Uka jisktʼajj wali qhanawa.

All in all, nothing less or nothing more.	Taqi kunas, janiw mä kuna jisk’a jan mä kuna juk’ampi.

But nothing needs to be done about it.	Ukampis janiw kunas uka toqet lurañajj wakiskiti.
He will do what he wants, when he wants.	Jupajj kuntï munki uk lurani, kuna horasas munki uk lurani.

I can’t do it at all.	Nayax janiw kunjamatsa lurirjamäkti.

He didn't want to do the right thing.	Jupajj janiw kunatï cheqäki uk lurañ munkänti.

But then he finally agreed.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, qhepatjja iyaw sänwa.
I don’t know anything, really.	Nayax janiw kuns yatkti, chiqpachansa.
He didn’t quite know how to say it.	Jupax janiw kunjams uka arunak arsuñ sum yatkänti.
The reason for his departure became clearer.	Kunatsa sarjjäna ukajj jukʼamp qhanaw amuyasïna.
It is accepted.	Ukajj iyaw satawa.
But he knows that is wrong.	Ukampis ukajj janiw walïkiti uk jupajj sum yati.
So, yeah, a little bit.	Ukhama, jïsa, mä juk’a.
That’s how he started.	Ukhamaw jupax qalltäna.

The question was where.	Uka jisktʼajj kawkhansa sasaw jisktʼasïna.
Not tonight, not ever.	Janiw jichha arumax, janiw kunapachas.

The age is very important.	Uka marax wali wakiskiriwa.
It felt surprisingly good.	Ukax wali muspharkañ sumaw jikxatasïna.
He loved to preach.	Jupajj yatiyañ wal munäna.
No one wants to see him.	Janiw khitis jupar uñjañ munkiti.
A place I want to visit again.	Mä cheqar wasitat sarañ munkta uka cheqar.
During that time, he visited the city several times.	Uka tiemponjja, walja kutiw uka markar saräna.
I really don’t think so.	Chiqpachansa janiw nayax ukhamäkti.
I thought it was better this way.	Nayax akham juk’amp askiwa sasaw amuyayäta.

One person cannot do that.	Mä jaqejj janiw uk lurkaspati.
I am not sure what could be the problem.	Kunas uka jan waltʼäwejj utjaspa uk janiw sum yatkti.

He didn't know why.	Kunatsa uk janiw yatkänti.

Silently he rushed towards them.	Amukiw jupanakar jankʼak saräna.

No one knows how he got the job.	Kunjamsa uka trabajo katoqäna uk janiw khitis yatkiti.
But no one did anything to him.	Ukampis janiw khitis jupar kuns lurkänti.
Something or someone is amazing.	Kunas jan ukax khitis muspharkañawa.
He didn't know what time it was.	Kuna horasas uk janiw yatkänti.

About three days later, he got one.	Niya kimsa uru qhepatjja, mä jukʼa katoqäna.

He said he couldn't do anything.	Janiw kuns lurañjamäkiti sasaw säna.
No one can confirm this.	Janiw khitis ukax chiqaw sañjamäkiti.
There was no reason for this.	Ukajj janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.

No, he didn't want to do that.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw ukham lurañ munkänti.
I don’t know when to do it.	Janiw kuna pachas lurañax uk yatkti.
I think everything is hard.	Taqi kunas ch’amawa sasaw amuyta.
And if that happens, he knows it.	Ukat ukham pasani ukhajja, uk sum yati.
He must have wanted to tell you himself.	Jupa pachpaw jumar yatiyañ munpachäna.
It’s really amazing.	Chiqpachansa ukax muspharkañawa.

He thought it was worth it.	Jupajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa amuyäna.
He sat in the hospital for a week.	Jupajj mä semanaw hospitalar qontʼasïna.
The question is what to do.	Uka jisktʼajj kunsa lurañasa.
I asked if he was okay.	Nayax jiskt’asta, jupax walikïskiti janicha.

He didn't know about her at the time.	Jupajj janiw uka tiempon jupat yatkänti.
I thought that was dumb.	Nayax ukax amukiw sasaw amuyayäta.
It's doing what it's supposed to do.	Kuntï lurañapäkäna uk luraski.
He knew what he would do when he got home.	Utar purisajj kunsa lurani uk sum yatïna.
He would never have done that.	Ukjja janipuniw jupajj lurkaspänti.
And somehow, he didn't say anything to her.	Ukat kunjamatsa, janiw kunsa jupar arskänti.
It’s good for regular practice.	Sapa kuti lurañatakix wali askiwa.
It was as if no one knew anything for sure.	Janis khitis kuns sum yatkaspa ukhamänwa.

He did it more often than not.	Jupajj jukʼampiw uk luräna.

It’s really really funny.	Chiqpachansa chiqpachansa wali muspharkañawa.

In fact, I went to another one in town.	Chiqansa, markan yaqha ukar sarawayta.
It arrived discreetly and quickly.	Ukax wali amuyumpiw purinïna ukat jankʼakiw purinïna.
He never did anything wrong to her.	Jupajj janipuniw jupar jan walinak lurkänti.
I would love to use this every day.	Nayax wali kusisitaw aka sapa uru apnaqañ munta.

Something could be interesting.	Kunas wali askïspawa.

Why, I wonder? 	¿Kunatsa, sasaw jisktʼasta?
But then he immediately started doing bad things.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, jankʼakiw jan walinak lurañ qalltäna.
It happened remarkably quickly.	Ukajj wali muspharkañ jankʼakiw pasäna.
Of course, this is often a good thing.	Chiqansa, ukax walja kutiw wali askiwa.

He really wanted to stay.	Jupajj cheqapuniw qheparañ munäna.
But ultimately, there was no other option.	Ukampis qhepatjja, janiw yaqha lurañajj utjkänti.
He immediately started talking about it.	Ukat jankʼakiw uka toqet parltʼañ qalltäna.

And, sure enough, there’s that one there this morning.	Ukat, chiqpachansa, uka maynix ukanx jichha alwaw utji.
Such a practice was not available at the time.	Ukham lurañajj janiw uka tiempon utjkänti.
I’m looking forward to the flight.	Nayax uka avión ukar sarañ suyt’askta.
He was terrified of what might happen.	Kunas pasaspa uk wal ajjsaräna.
And somehow that didn’t matter.	Ukat kunjamatsa ukax janiw kunäkisa ukhamäkänti.
I think it is important to do that.	Uk lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
But the point was that the point was pretty clear.	Ukampis uka tuqitxa, uka tuqitxa wali qhanaw amuyasïna.
And you should, too.	Ukat jumax ukham lurañamawa, ukhamaraki.
He was devastated and .	Jupajj wali llakitaw jikjjatasïna ukat .
I think he was.	Jupajj ukhamänwa sasaw amuyta.
This is the world.	Aka pachax ukhamawa.
Maybe he should, after all.	Inas jupajj wakischispa, taqe kunat sipansa.
A little bit of everything, really.	Mä juk’a taqi kuna, chiqpachansa.
Bad or bad.	Jan wali jan ukax jan wali.
The snow and ice.	Uka ch’uqi ukat ch’uqi.
He didn’t want to live too much.	Janiw sinti jakañ munkänti.
I don’t make that much money.	Janiw nayax ukham qullqi jikxatkti.
A good school can make a good year.	Mä suma yatiqañ utax mä suma mara luraspawa.
It looks great and is very comfortable.	Wali suma uñtatawa ukat wali sumawa.
And it can be very useful.	Ukat wali askïspawa.
He’s doing really well, he’s awesome.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw wali sum luraski, jupax wali muspharkañawa.
Of course this is .	Chiqansa akax .
Thank you very much, but no.	Walpun yuspärta, ukampis janiw ukhamäkiti.
All this fascinated him.	Taqi ukanakax juparux chuym ch’allxtayäna.
I don’t know, maybe.	Janiw yatkti, inas.
Maybe you want to see them?.	Inas jupanakar uñjañ munasma?.
We all have it at some point.	Taqinipuniw mä juk’a pachanx utjistu.
How did it do that .	Kunjamatsa ukajj ukham luräna .
There is a lot of value in doing this.	Uk lurañajj wali wakiskiriwa.
Blood or other help may be needed.	Inas wila jan ukax yaqha yanaptʼa wakischispa.
There are two possibilities.	Pä kunaw utjaspa.
I think it’s exciting at the time.	Nayax amuyta uka pachax wali kusiskañawa.
I can never believe such a thing.	Janipuniw ukham yänak lurañax iyaw sañjamäkiti.
Big, big, too big.	Jach’a, jach’a, sinti jach’a.
It went quiet this morning.	Jichha alwajj amukiw sarjjäna.
He learned everything the hard way.	Jupajj wali chʼamampiw taqe kun yateqäna.
It’s happening to everything.	Taqi kunat pasaski.
He would do anything for me.	Jupajj nayatakejj kunsa luraspäna.
I want something .	Nayax mä kuns munta .
It doesn’t matter how things turn out for you.	Kunjamsa jumatakix kunas pasaspa ukax janiw kunäkisa.
What have you done	Kuns lurawayta .
She immediately started doing household chores.	Ukat jankʼakiw utan lurañanak lurañ qalltäna.
That was just as necessary.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw wakisïna.
It never seemed possible.	Janipuniw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
We have a more immediate task.	Mä jukʼamp jankʼak lurañaw utjistu.
In fact, he rarely said no to me.	Chiqansa, jupax jukʼakiw janiw sasaw sitäna.
And you’ve got to do a good job.	Ukat jumax mä suma irnaqäw lurañamawa.
He’s awesome, too.	Jupax wali muspharkañawa, ukhamaraki.
I haven't done anything for you.	Janiw nayajj jumatak kuns lurkti.
He stayed the whole time.	Jupajj taqe tiempow qheparäna.
He had no reason not to, of course.	Jupax janiw kuna razonas jan lurañapatak utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
I decided to leave first thing in the morning.	Nayax nayraqat alwaw sarxañ amtawayta.
I was really excited about this book.	Chiqpachansa aka libro tuqitxa wali kusisitaw jikxatasiyäta.
And if we don’t .	Ukat jan ukham lurañäni ukhaxa .
I just want it once.	Nayax mä kutikiw munta.
He obviously didn’t want to talk.	Jupax qhanaw jan parlañ munkänti.
He does not know what will happen after that.	Uka qhepatjja, kunas pasani uk janiw yatkiti.
But he can take care of himself.	Ukampis jupa pachpaw sum uñjasispa.
He said it was true.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sasaw säna.
And he was a wonderful person to me.	Ukat jupajj nayatakejj wali suma jaqënwa.
You’re the one who can do it.	Jumaw ukham lurasma.
Everything is pretty good.	Taqi kunas niya wali sumawa.
I don’t want one.	Janiw nayax mä munkti.
I’m terrified that someone .	Nayax wali axsaratwa maynix .
He is the one who controls her.	Jupaw jupar apnaqi.
That’s because they.	Ukax kunatix jupanakax.
He can do it for hours.	Jupajj walja horanakaw uk luraspa.
There will be two parts.	Ukanx pä chiqaw utjani.
Something new, more exciting.	Kunas machaq, juk’amp kusiskañawa.
Halfway ahead.	Chikat nayraqat.
But there was nothing after that.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja janiw kunas utjkänti.
But not beyond me.	Ukampis janiw nayat sipansa.
There’s nothing more to it than that.	Ukax janiw ukat sipan juk’ampi utjkiti.
I want to take care of you.	Nayajj jumanakar sum uñjañ munta.
He doesn't go to school.	Jupajj janiw escuelar sarkiti.
On the contrary, it was a good night.	Jan ukasti, suma arumaw utjäna.
He went before me.	Jupaw nayat nayrajj saräna.
If there is such a one.	Ukham maynix utjaspa ukhaxa.
Now he didn't want to know.	Jichhajj janiw yatiñ munkänti.
I did that because of it.	Nayajj ukatwa ukham lurayäta.
That would have done me.	Ukaw nayarojj luraspäna.
Now I know that is not the case.	Jichhajj janiw ukhamäkiti uk yattwa.
Don't leave it too long.	Janiw sinti jaya tiempo jaytañamäkiti.
He will not be present at every meeting.	Jupajj janiw sapa tantachäwin utjkaniti.
They are enough for me.	Jupanakax nayatakix walikïskiwa.
This happened to them three times.	Ukajj kimsa kutiw jupanakar pasäna.
He almost almost died .	Jupajj niyaw niyaw jiwjjäna .
They know too much.	Jupanakax sinti yatipxi.
He had always wanted it.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk munäna.
He didn’t want to tell them anything, of course.	Janiw jupanakar kuns yatiyañ munkänti, chiqpachansa.
Maybe one should go as directed.	Inas maynix kunjamtï siski ukhamarjam sarañapa.
So there was nothing too surprising about it.	Ukhamajj janiw kunas uka toqet sinti muspharkañ utjkänti.
That’s what made it real .	Ukaw cheqpach lurawayi .
I want more books.	Nayax juk’amp libronak munta.
It was obvious that he never would.	Janipuniw ukham lurkaspänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I’m very happy with the rest.	Uka qhipharux wali kusisitaw jikxatasi.
He thought the same thing about you at one time.	Jupajj mä tiemponjja, ukhamarakiw jumat amuyäna.
These are amazing.	Ukanakax muspharkañawa.
I’m so worried about everything.	Nayax taqi kunat walpun llakista.
Nobody, but nobody.	Janiw khitis, ukampis janiw khitis.
There will never be anyone like you.	Janipuniw jumar uñtasit khitis utjkaniti.
Everything is clear so far.	Taqi kunas qhanaw jichhakamax utji.
Red, more red.	Wila, juk’ampi wila.
That was all he could think of.	Ukakiw jupajj amuyasïna.
He takes the first step.	Jupaw nayrïr amtar puri.
But it’s okay.	Ukampis walikïskiti.
I am doing the right thing.	Nayajj kunatï cheqäki uk luraskta.
He didn’t know exactly what this man wanted.	Jupax janiw kuntï aka jaqix munkäna uk sum yatkänti.
It means you really love me .	Ukax chiqpachapuniw nayar munasta sañ muni .
None, except very few.	Janiw khitis, jan ukasti wali jukʼakiw.
It hit him hard.	Juparux wali ch’amampiw ch’allt’äna.
Soon itself again.	Mä juk’a pachax jupa pachpaw wasitat.
You don’t want to get into mine.	Jumax janiw nayan ukar mantañ munktati.
Honestly, he’s a lovely guy.	Chiqpachansa, jupax munat waynawa.
She longed to catch a glimpse of him.	Jupar mä jukʼa uñjañ wal munäna.
Let's see what happens after that.	Uka qhepatjja, kunas pasani uk uñjañäni.
But one last time.	Ukampis mä qhep qhepa kuti.
I want to know how good it is to do this.	Nayax kunjams uka lurañax wali askïspa uk yatiñ munta.
To his surprise, he loved it very much.	Ukat walpun wal munasïna, ukaw wal muspharäna.
I’m not planning next year.	Nayax janiw jutir marax amtkti.
Here’s a place.	Aka chiqan mä chiqa.
There was room for me in this world.	Aka pachanx nayatakix mä chiqaw utjäna.
He said it himself the other day.	Jupa pachpaw yaqha urux uk arsüna.
What about money.	Kunas qullqi tuqitxa.
There were not many people there.	Ukanjja, janiw walja jaqenakajj utjkänti.
But the old man knew it.	Ukampis jilïr jaqejj uk sum yatïna.
Yes, it was necessary to do so.	Jïsa, ukham lurañaw wakisïna.
There is no problem for me .	Nayatakejj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkiti .
Good, bad, bad.	Suma, jan wali, jan wali.
And, that doesn’t work.	Ukat, ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
A better word actually.	Mä juk’amp suma aru chiqpachansa.
It happened fairly quickly.	Ukajj mä jukʼa jankʼakiw pasäna.
He says he always drinks.	Jupax sapa kutiw umañ munta sasaw saraki.
He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Uka tuqitxa kunjamsa jikxatasïna ukxa janiw sum yatkänti.
He said it would be no problem.	Jupajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaniti sasaw säna.
I’m always learning or doing something.	Nayax sapa kutiw yatiqañ munta jan ukax kuns lurañ munta.
I’m not sure what .	Nayax kuntix .
It’s been a bad experience.	Jan waliw jikxatasi.
And he says it’s fine.	Ukat jupax walikïskiwa sasaw saraki.
And there’s truth to that.	Ukat ukax chiqaw utji.
It’s with me.	Nayamp chikaw utji.
For me, it wasn’t.	Nayatakix janiw ukhamäkänti.
Several times at once.	Walja kutiw mä kuti.
I can’t do very well.	Nayax janiw sinti sum lurañjamäkiti.
It seems to really suit him.	Chiqpachansa juparux wali askïkaspas ukhamawa.
I don’t remember half the time.	Janiw chikat pachax nayan amtaskti.
That alone is impressive.	Ukax sapakix wali muspharkañawa.
That was the last anyone saw of him.	Ukaw qhip qhipa kuti khitis jupar uñjäna.
The boy has been feeling this way for years.	Uka waynax walja maranakaw ukham jikxatasïna.
He needs to do it more.	Jupajj jukʼampiw uk lurañapa.
And that, is what’s so wrong with this world.	Ukat ukax, kunatix aka pachanx wali jan walïki ukawa.
There is nothing, and then .	Janiw kunas utjkiti, ukat ukat .
I didn’t go anywhere, I didn’t see anyone.	Janiw kawkirus sarkti, janiw khitirus uñjkti.
But now it’s a different time.	Ukampis jichhax yaqha pacharuw purini.
He saw her yesterday.	Jupax qharüruw jupar uñjäna.
And the more foreign the better.	Ukat jukʼamp yaqha markankir jaqenakajj jukʼamp askiwa.
You are the first person .	Jumax nayrïr jaqiwa .
That is completely unnecessary.	Ukajj taqe kunas janiw wakiskiti.
It definitely looks better now.	Chiqpachansa jichhax juk’amp suma uñtatawa.
You can do that anywhere.	Kawkhansa ukham lurasma.
You’re called the best.	Jumax wali suma satawa.
That is even more exciting! 	¡Ukajj jukʼamp kusiskañawa!
That’s all there ever was.	Ukakiw kunapachas utjäna.
There is no other house.	Janiw yaqha utax utjkiti.
It takes a very long time .	Ukatakejj wali jaya tiempow munasispa .
And he lived there alone.	Ukat sapakiw ukan jakasïna.
It’s not a yes or no.	Janiw mä jïsa jan ukax jan ukhamäkiti.
It’s all fun.	Ukax taqpach kusiskañawa.
I feel like a complete fool.	Mä qʼala loqhe jaqëkaspas ukhamwa amuyasta.
He had just moved to town.	Jupajj jichhakiw markar sarjjäna.
But obviously this is often well known.	Ukampis qhanaw ukax walja kutix wali sum uñt’atawa.
It is very clear .	Ukax wali qhanawa .
There are two things you can do.	Pä lurañaw utji.
Nothing here yet.	Janiw kunas akanx jichhakamax utjkiti.
You know that stuff.	Jumax uka yänak yatisktawa.
I’m having a bit of a hard time, actually.	Nayax mä juk’a ch’amaw jikxatasi, chiqpachansa.
Amazing, she said.	Muspharkañawa, sasaw jupax säna.
In fact, he did.	Chiqpachansa, ukham luräna.
He sees it almost every week.	Niya sapa semanaw uk uñji.
But before that, something else began.	Ukampis janïr uka tiemponjja, yaqha lurañaw qalltäna.
This is obviously wrong.	Ukax qhanaw jan walïkiti.
He never wants to spend too long in the park.	Jupax janipuniw parkin sinti jaya tiempo sarnaqañ munkiti.
And that great wind.	Ukat uka jachʼa thaya.
That’s a little bit of a character.	Ukax mä jisk’a jaqiwa.
There’s no reason why it can’t be done.	Janiw kunatsa jan lurañjamäkiti.
It’s not good for anyone.	Janiw khitirus askïkiti.
So let’s make it real.	Ukhamajj cheqpach lurañäni.
At the time of the	Uka tiemponjja .
The impossible is nothing.	Jan lurañjamäki ukajj janiw kunäkisa.
That’s why you shouldn’t do that.	Ukatwa jan ukham lurañamäkiti.
But it never happened before.	Ukampis janipuniw ukham nayrajj utjkänti.
And why or who doesn’t matter now.	Ukat kunatsa jan ukax khitis jichhax janiw kunäkisa.
He still felt that this was important.	Ukajj wali wakiskiriwa sasaw jupajj wali amuyäna.
But time doesn't work that way.	Ukampis tiempojj janiw ukham irnaqkiti.
He didn't want to get there.	Jupajj janiw uka cheqar puriñ munkänti.
I love that so much.	Nayajj ukham walpun munasta.
But quietly it wasn’t.	Ukampis amukiw janiw ukhamäkänti.
He said he didn’t know.	Jupax janiw yatkti sasaw säna.
He’s well known for it.	Jupax uka tuqit wali uñt’atawa.
That is the way it is now.	Ukhamaw jichhajj utji.
I can’t find a way to do that.	Janiw kunjamatsa uk lurañatakix jikxatkti.
No, do something with that attitude.	Janiwa, uka amuyumpiw kuns lurañama.
That may not matter, but it didn't.	Ukajj inas jan kunäkisa, ukampis janiw ukhamäkänti.
Tomorrow doesn’t matter.	Qharürux janiw kunäkisa.
He came home one day.	Jupajj mä uruw utar purinïna.
Good tennis weather.	Suma tenis pachax wali sumawa.
I didn’t know how.	Kunjamsa uk jan yatkayätti.

He was moved by it.	Jupajj uka toqetwa chuym chʼalljjtayasïna.
It reaches midday.	Chika urukamaw puri.
And that’s obviously not going to do it.	Ukat ukax qhanaw jan lurañapa.
He really wants to see her.	Chiqpachansa jupar uñjañ muni.
He’s really well known.	Jupax chiqpachansa wali uñt’atawa.
So it doesn't really matter.	Ukhamajj janiw cheqpachapun kunäkisa.
Everything is faster as well.	Taqi kunas juk’amp jank’akiw ukhamaraki.
He’s done it again.	Jupax wasitat lurawayi.

He says he wants to stay with me.	Jupax nayamp qhiparañ munta sasaw saraki.

It all comes down to me.	Taqi kunas nayaruw puri.

You don’t have to go anywhere.	Janiw kawkirus sarañax wakiskiti.
Well, everyone except myself.	Ukhama, taqiniw jan ukax naya pachpaw.

Don’t leave it to you.	Janiw jumanakar jaytañamäkiti.
No more that’s not the case.	Janiw juk’ampi ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
It’s sort of what it is.	Ukax mä juk’a kuntix utjki ukawa.
There was something else to do.	Ukanjja, yaqha lurañaw utjäna.
He definitely saw it.	Jupajj cheqapuniw uk uñjäna.
It’s rather unusual.	Ukax juk’amp jan uñt’atawa.
It happens when it happens.	Ukajj kunapachatï pasaski ukhaw pasaspa.
He said what he could do.	Jupajj kunsa luraspa uk sänwa.
However, he did not say where exactly.	Ukampis kawkhansa cheqpachapun utjäna, uk janiw siskänti.
You can do better yourself than that.	Ukat sipansa juma pachpaw jukʼamp sum lurasma.
He worked for himself.	Jupa pachpaw irnaqäna.
Now you tell me.	Jichhajj jumaw nayar yatiyäta.
Right this time.	Chiqaw aka kutix.
And that’s what I like right now.	Ukat ukax jichhax nayatakix wali askiwa.
I didn’t want to go out at all.	Janiw kunjamatsa mistuñ munkayätti.
I don't need to do that now.	Janiw jichhajj ukanak lurañajj wakiskiti.
He immediately realized himself.	Ukat jankʼakiw jupa pachpa amuyasïna.
I’m in love with you right now.	Jichhax jumamp munasiñampiw jikxatastxa.
Like he wanted to take it from her.	Kunjamtï jupat apsuñ munkäna ukhama.
I did this last night.	Nayax nayrïr arumaw ukham lurawayta.
He is not like that just yet.	Jupajj janiw jichhak ukhamäkiti.
Good for you, of course.	Jumatakix wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
I don’t want to say no to that.	Janiw ukham jan sañ munkti.
But this looks pretty good.	Ukampis akax wali sumaw uñtasi.
I wasn't too surprised.	Nayajj janiw sinti muspharkayätti.
So when he left.	Ukhamajj jupajj sarjjäna ukhajja.
Nobody likes it.	Janiw khitis gustkiti.
I don't want to talk any more.	Janiw jukʼamp parltʼañ munkti.
He did her a favor.	Jupajj jupar sum luräna.
That’s good, she said.	Ukax wali askiwa, sasaw jupax säna.
And he saw something strange.	Ukat mä jukʼa muspharkañ uñjäna.
I want better.	Nayax juk’amp sumaw munta.
I’ve always given up.	Nayax sapa kutiw jaytawayta.
I didn’t understand much until now.	Jichhakamax janiw sinti amuykayätti.
He himself did not know this.	Jupa pachpajj janiw uk yatkänti.
Also, a baseball.	Ukhamaraki, mä béisbol.
He did it himself.	Jupa pachpaw ukham luräna.
After all, he saw why he went.	Taqi kunat sipansa, jupaw kunatsa saräna uk uñjäna.
Whatever he said.	Kunas sasaw säna.
Nothing was necessary.	Janiw kunas wakiskänti.
I don’t really know how to make this stuff up.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix aka yänak lurañ yatkti.
It is difficult to do nothing.	Jan kun lurañajj chʼamakiwa.
And it was a beautiful day.	Ukat uka urux wali sumapunïnwa.
Don't forget to tell us where you came from.	Jan armasimti kawkitsa jutta uk yatiyapjjeta.
He did it all so well.	Jupaw taqe ukanak wali sum luräna.
He knows that very well.	Jupax ukham wali sum yati.
There really is no reason.	Chiqpachansa janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
I decided to give it up.	Uka jaytañ amtawayta.
One or more.	Mä jan ukax walja.
He did it for me.	Jupaw nayatak lurawayi.
It was just a matter of timing and timing.	Ukajj kuna horasas ukat kuna horasas pasäna ukakiw utjäna.
He definitely needed to do better.	Jupajj cheqapuniw jukʼamp sum lurañajj wakisïna.
It wasn’t, but it felt real.	Janiw ukhamäkänti, ukampis cheqapuniw ukham amuyasïna.
The past is amazing.	Nayra pachax wali muspharkañawa.
He wanted more, everyone wanted it from him.	Jupajj jukʼamp munäna, taqeniw jupat wal munäna.
I feel uncomfortable.	Nayajj jan sum jikjjatasta.
That’s what you have to do on the spot.	Ukax uka chiqan lurañapawa.
It’s a little bit of a snowflake.	Ukaxa mä jisk’a ch’uqi ch’uqi.
Kind of the same.	Mä juk’a juk’a pachpa.
He didn't really notice anything.	Jupajj janiw cheqpachapun kuns amuyaskänti.
That's pretty much what he said.	Ukajj niya ukhamwa jupajj säna.
Another new word.	Yaqha machaq aru.
There is no need to do this.	Janiw uk lurañajj wakiskiti.
Let me know later.	Qhipürux yatiyapxita.
I know how it will arrive.	Nayajj kunjamsa purini uk sum yatta.
And that’s what it comes down to.	Ukat ukax ukaruw puri.
No one really knows anything.	Chiqpachansa janiw khitis kuns yatkiti.
He agreed to the sight.	Uk uñjasajj iyaw sänwa.
It is silent and spacious and impressive.	Ukajj amukiw ukat jachʼa ukat wali muspharkañawa.
Remember, it was urgent.	Uk jankʼak lurañaw wakisïna, uk jan armasimti.
Or a few times.	Jan ukajj mä qhawqha kuti.
He wanted to do it more often.	Jupajj jukʼamp kutiw uk lurañ munäna.
He moved her away.	Jupaw jupar yaqha cheqar sarjjäna.
I’ve come hard and long.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw ukat jaya pachaw jutta.
He was in desperate need of help.	Jupajj yanaptʼa wal munäna.
But I don’t know about him.	Ukampis janiw jupat yatkti.
And it really takes years.	Ukat chiqpachansa walja maranakaw munasispa.
This is not the case in winter.	Juyphi pachanx janiw ukhamäkiti.
There is no time alone.	Janiw kuna pachas sapakix utjkiti.
He likes it here.	Juparux akanx wali askiwa.
Of course, one is not.	Chiqansa, maynix janiw ukhamäkiti.
I really need help.	Chiqpachansa yanaptʼa munta.
The local man refused.	Uka markankir jaqix janiw munkänti.
I’m going to say that here.	Nayax akanx ukham sañ munta.
I don’t want to do it too long.	Janiw sinti jaya tiempo lurañ munkti.
I don't want to suggest otherwise.	Janiw yaqha tuqit amuytʼayañ munkti.
There really would be no problem with that.	Chiqpachansa uka tuqitxa janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkaspati.
Something only he can do.	Kuntï jupa sapakiw luraspa.
You do well here.	Jumax akanx wali sum lurasma.
It’s all a bit weird.	Taqi kunas mä juk’a muspharkañawa.
But it was clear what was going to happen.	Ukampis kunas pasani ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Not that john.	Janiw uka john.

There will be more rain.	Juk’amp jallu pachax utjani.
Everything had to be done right.	Taqi kunas chiqapar lurañaw wakisïna.
It’s a little better financially.	Qullqi tuqitxa mä juk’a sumawa.
I’m going to just let it use it.	Nayax ukakiw jan ukax apnaqañapatak jaytañ amtasta.
So when do you .	Ukhamajj kunapachas jumajj .
Which he did very well.	Ukjja jupajj wali sumwa luräna.
But he knew nothing about it.	Ukampis janiw uka toqet kuns yatkänti.
So we need to do more about it.	Ukatwa uka toqet jukʼamp lurañasa.
There will be no charge.	Janiw kuna qullqis utjkaniti.
But it doesn’t mean that.	Ukampis janiw uk sañ munkiti.
I’m not sure if I’m going to .	Nayajj ukhamarakiw .
Money for money is good.	Qullqix qullqix wali askiwa.
When he did, the question became clear.	Ukham luräna ukhajja, uka jisktʼajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
No coffee for you.	Janiw kuna café jumatakix utjkiti.
It’s going to be a great time.	Ukax mä jach’a pacharuw purini.
He’s obviously done this before.	Jupax qhanaw nayrax ukham luratayna.
But we'll see to that.	Ukampis jiwasajj ukanak uñjañäni.
But he said he didn't want to see any more.	Ukampis janiw jukʼamp uñjañ munkti sasaw säna.
It’s definitely going to take some time.	Chiqpachansa mä juk’a pachaw sarañapa.
They don’t know how to say anything else.	Jupanakax janiw yaqha tuqit arsuñ yatipkiti.
Everything happened so fast after that.	Uka qhepatjja, taqe kunas jankʼakiw pasäna.
He learned more about it later.	Jupajj qhepatwa uka toqet jukʼamp sum yatïna.
I feel better here.	Nayax akan juk’amp sum jikxatastxa.
It is what he needs.	Ukajj kuntï jupajj wakiski ukawa.
Man isn’t that.	Jaqix janiw ukat ukhamäkiti.
That’s why I’m sorry.	Ukatwa llakista.
he called after me.	sasaw nayar qhepat jawsäna.
That was two or three years ago now.	Ukajj pä jan ukajj kimsa mara nayraw jichhajj pasäna.
Everyone is not like that.	Taqinipuniw janiw ukhamäkiti.
He was virtually nonexistent.	Jupajj niya janiw khitis utjkänti.
But he didn't know all of that.	Ukampis janiw taqe ukanak yatkänti.
He can do nothing more.	Janiw jukʼamp kuns lurkaspati.
Therefore, we will be fair.	Ukatwa, jiwasax chiqapar uñjañäni.
What do you know that he doesn't?.	¿Kunsa yatta, jupajj janiw uk yatkiti?.
I’m doing my homework.	Nayax tareanak luraskta.
He wanted to see things from a new perspective.	Jupajj machaq amuyumpiw kunsa uñjañ munäna.
He said he was really.	Chiqpachansa sasaw säna.
Maybe he wanted to say yes.	Inas jupajj jïsa sañ munpachäna.
I think it’s you.	Nayax jumaw ukham amuyta.
But the fact of the matter is .	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj .
That's how he is.	Ukhamaw jupajj utji.
He refused to agree to it.	Ukatakejj janiw jupajj iyaw sañ munkänti.
And now tell me.	Ukat jichhax yatiyapxita.
I wanted to know what she looked like.	Kunjamsa jupajj uñnaqäna uk yatiñwa munta.
He himself did not know much about it.	Jupa pachpajj janiw uka toqet sum yatkänti.
It all gets better very soon.	Taqi kunas wali jank’akiw juk’amp askïspa.
Once here it is.	Mä kutix akanx ukax ukhamawa.
He wanted to know what had happened and why.	Kunas pasäna ukat kunatsa pasäna uk yatiñwa munäna.
This is especially evident in language.	Ukax aru tuqitx juk’amp qhanaw uñjasi.
He seemed to have nothing quite to say.	Jupajj janis kunsa sum sañ munkaspa ukhamänwa.
It just looks impossible.	Ukax jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamakiw uñtasi.
You are the one you want the most.	Jumax khititix juk’amp munkta ukawa.
But I don't remember exactly.	Ukampis janiw sum amtaskti.
I can’t stand snow.	Nayax janiw ch’uqi aguantañjamäkiti.
It’s still a pretty big one.	Wali suma jach’a.
There is something to be done about it, and that is good.	Uka tuqitxa kuna lurañas utji, ukax wali askiwa.
Other than that it doesn’t.	Yaqha tuqitxa janiwa.
That was the most frightening thing.	Ukaw jukʼamp ajjsaräna.
He robbed the house.	Jupaw uka uta lunthatasïna.
And he was sad, he realized.	Ukat llakitaw jikxatasïna, sasaw amuyasïna.
This is a very important question.	Aka jisktʼajj wali wakiskiriwa.
That was all that happened at the time.	Uka tiemponjja, ukakiw pasäna.
He wanted another beer.	Jupax yaqha cerveza munäna.
That’s what someone noticed.	Ukax mayniw amuyasïna.
He started walking with us.	Jupajj nanakamp chikaw sarañ qalltäna.
Beyond that, of course.	Ukat sipansa, chiqpachansa.
He treated her very well.	Jupajj jupar wali sum uñjäna.
This means researching first.	Ukajj nayraqat yatxatañ sañ muni.
It looks like tomorrow.	Qhipürux ukham uñt’atawa.
Now that's a good thing.	Jichhajj ukajj wali askiwa.
It worked well for a long time.	Walja tiempow wali sum irnaqäna.
There’s more day than morning.	Alwat juk’amp uruw utji.
And they were pretty good.	Ukat jupanakax wali sumapunïnwa.
And a little more still.	Ukat mä juk’a juk’ampi wali.
That one is absolutely necessary.	Uka maynix chiqpachapuniw wakisi.
And they are better.	Ukat jupanakax jukʼamp askiwa.
Always thought she was beautiful.	Sapa kutiw jupax suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukham amuyasïna.
Long ago he was something else.	Walja tiempo nayrajj jupajj yaqha ukhamänwa.
There was nothing in this one.	Janiw kunas aka maynix utjkänti.
But that was an isolated incident.	Ukampis ukajj mä sapakiw pasäna.
He treated her very well.	Jupajj wali sumwa jupar uñjäna.
They don’t know how to survive.	Jupanakax janiw kunjams jakañ yatipkiti.
House and room available.	Uta ukat cuarto ukan utjki uka.
I think it’s worth doing.	Nayax amuyta, lurañax wali askiwa.
It was just what he wanted, he thought.	Kuntï munkäna ukakiw sasaw amuyäna.
It was remarkably clear.	Ukajj wali muspharkañ qhanaw amuyasïna.
But instead, he decided to use force.	Ukampis jan ukasti, chʼamampiw apnaqañ amtäna.
He knew well for it.	Ukatakejj sum yatïna.
That's when I felt that way.	Ukhaw ukham jikjjatasta.
That happened a lot, actually.	Ukax walpun pasäna, chiqpachansa.
I don’t really remember that.	Uka tuqitxa janiw chiqpach amtaskti.
The way he did it gave him life.	Kunjamsa uk luräna ukaw jakañ churäna.
Don't do it when you don't need to.	Kunapachatï jan wakiski ukhajj janiw uk lurañamäkiti.
I can't even figure it out.	Janiw nayax uka tuqit amuytʼirjamäkti.
He was curious about it.	Jupajj uka toqet yatiñ wal munäna.
I don’t want to talk to him.	Janiw jupamp parlañ munkti.
So yeah, long .	Ukhamajj jïsa, jaya .
This is especially noticeable in the middle of the day.	Ukajj chika uruw jukʼamp amuyasi.
It can happen very very quickly.	Ukax wali wali jank’akiw utjaspa.
But he finished it.	Ukampis jupaw uk tukuyäna.
He is very quiet, sad.	Jupax wali amukiw jikxatasi, llakitaw jikxatasi.
But the facts are clear.	Ukampis kunatï cheqäki ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
I'm going to hurry up .	Nayax jank'akiw .
No one wanted to talk.	Janiw khitis parlañ wal munkänti.
There is no such thing now.	Jichhajj janiw ukanak lurañajj utjkiti.
I did my homework.	Nayajj tareanak lurayäta.
He learned this early on.	Jupajj nayratpachaw uk yateqäna.
I know you feel the same way.	Nayajj yattwa, jumajj ukhamarakiw jikjjatasta.
I know you’re great.	Nayax yattwa jumax wali jach’a jaqïtawa.
Fortunately, he enjoyed it.	Ukax wali askiwa, jupax wali kusisitaw jikxatasïna.
He didn't like it himself.	Jupa pachpajj janiw ukajj gustkänti.
Overall, it was pretty good.	Taqi kunat sipansa, wali sumapunïnwa.
I really think so, yes.	Chiqpachansa nayax ukham amuyta, jïsa.
Now he needed some time to do it.	Jichhajj jupaw mä jukʼa tiempo lurañatak wakisïna.
Coming soon next time.	Jutïr kutin jankʼakiw purini.
That’s wrong, of course.	Ukax janiw walïkiti, chiqpachansa.
I didn't want to go.	Nayajj janiw sarañ munkayätti.
Time and money.	Tiempo ukat qullqi.
Of course, it is even better.	Chiqansa, ukax jukʼamp sumawa.
He can, but he won't.	Jupajj luraspawa, ukampis janiw lurkaniti.
I know everything is nothing.	Nayax yatxatwa taqi kunas janiw kunas utjkiti.
I was so happy to do that for you.	Nayajj wali kusisitaw jumatak ukham lurayäta.
People don’t matter.	Jaqinakax janiw kunäkisa.
But something new happened.	Ukampis mä machaq kunas pasäna.
I didn’t want to miss a chance.	Nayax janiw mä ch’am tukuñ munkayätti.
It’s almost too strong.	Niya wali ch’amawa.
And, it felt good.	Ukat, wali sumaw jikxatasïna.
It wanted to repeat itself.	Ukajj jupa pachpaw wasitat lurañ munäna.
I said something nice about you.	Nayax jumat mä suma aru arsuwayta.
It doesn't get any worse than that.	Janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp jan walïkiti.
I think it’s completely unusual.	Nayax amuyta, ukax taqpach jan uñt’atawa.
He understood it, but he had been reluctant to do it before.	Jupajj uk sum amuyäna, ukampis nayrajj janiw ukanak lurañ munkänti.
That’s a little more important.	Ukax mä juk’a juk’amp wakiskiriwa.
Almost everything was excellent.	Niya taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.
I'm going to see them tomorrow.	Qharüruw jupanakar uñjir sarä.
So there is no need to go there.	Ukhamajj janiw ukar sarañajj wakiskiti.
Or so it happened to me.	Jan ukajj nayatakejj ukhamarakiw pasäna.
The night of the	Uka arumax .
I know what is coming.	Kunas jutani uk sum yatta.
I see it clearly in this regard.	Uka toqet sum uñjta.
In fact, everything.	Chiqansa, taqi kunas.
This is the ultimate chance.	Akax qhipa ch’amawa.
Or so this is.	Jan ukax ukhamakiw akax.
So never .	Ukhamajj janipuniw .
He hit it pretty well though.	Jupax wali sumaw ch’allt’äna ukampis.
Consider what happened next.	Uka qhepat kunas pasäna uk uñjañäni.
And it wasn’t for me.	Ukat janiw nayatakix ukhamäkänti.
That is not the case for this.	Ukatakejj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Let's see what the problem is.	Kuna jan waltʼäwis utji uk uñjañäni.
Maybe he can do something for you.	Inas jupajj jumatak kuns luraspa.
It didn’t need water.	Janiw umamp wakiskänti.
So what, he told himself.	Ukhamajj kunas, sasaw jupa pachpajj säna.
And that you guys.	Ukat uka jumanakax.
But this isn’t a bad thing.	Ukampis akax janiw jan walïkiti.
It’s time again.	Ukax wasitatwa pachax purini.
After that, more .	Uka qhepatjja, jukʼampiw .
He immediately falls in love with her.	Jupajj jankʼakiw jupamp wal munasi.
But I was told that was not the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw sapjjetäna.
So he didn't do these things.	Ukhamajj janiw ukanak lurkänti.
That’s fine, that’s what you want to do.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax kuntix lurañ munkta ukawa.
I am your man.	Nayajj jumanakan jaqïtwa.
I can’t say for sure.	Janiw chiqapar sañjamäkiti.
School is fun.	Yatiqañ utax wali kusiskañawa.
Which is important, very important.	Kuna wakiskir, wali wakiskiriwa.
I mean money.	Nayax qullqi sañ munta.
He started doing some research on it.	Jupax uka tuqit mä juk’a yatxatañ qalltäna.
That’s okay, that’s cool.	Ukax walikïskiwa, ukax wali sumawa.
I walked to school every day.	Sapa uruw escuelar kayuk sarawayta.
So yeah, that was pretty cool.	Ukhamajj jïsa, ukajj wali sumapunïnwa.
He understood me completely.	Jupajj taqe chuymaw nayar amuyäna.
Several more days.	Walja urunak juk’ampi.
It used to be that way for me.	Nayatakejj nayrajj ukhamänwa.
But, it all happened so fast.	Ukampis, taqi kunas wali jank’akiw pasäna.
He didn't say much at all.	Jupajj janiw kunjamatsa wal siskänti.
The result is that, .	Ukax akham sañ muni, .
Try to make a new book.	Machaq libro lurañatakiw chʼamachasiñama.
He didn't want that to happen again.	Jupajj janiw mayamp ukham pasañap munkänti.
I know he can do it for me.	Nayax yattwa jupax nayatakix uk luraspawa.
That means you will need to do three things.	Ukajj kimsa lurañaw wakisini sañ muni.
Of course, no one needs to.	Chiqansa, janiw khitis ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
If he did, that's fine.	Jupajj ukham luräna ukhajja, walikïskiwa.
But, this is it.	Ukampis, akax ukhamawa.
I didn’t want to give blood.	Janiw wila churañ munkayätti.
Never, ever, thought of it.	Janipuniw, janipuniw, amuyirïkti.
And it certainly feels that way.	Ukat chiqpachansa ukhamaw jikxatasi.
I think you know about that.	Nayax amuyta jumax uka tuqit yatisktawa.
¡That feels so good!.	¡Ukax wali sumaw jikxatasi!.
He had been doing bad things for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow jan walinak luräna.
This is surprising, and fascinating.	Akax muspharkañawa, ukat wali muspharkañawa.
Such a little place.	Ukham jisk’a chiqa.
But it doesn’t have to be that extreme.	Ukampis janiw ukham sinti jan walinak lurañax wakiskiti.
You are out of time.	Jumax jan tiemponiw jikxatastaxa.
It’s very quiet, but yeah, it’s familiar.	Wali amukiw, ukampis jïsa, uñt’atawa.
The guy can do anything.	Uka waynax taqi kuns luraspawa.
I didn’t know, maybe next time!.	Nayax janiw yatkayätti, inas jutïr kutin!.
And everything else, for that matter.	Ukat taqi kuna, uka tuqitxa.
I hope he means that.	Nayax suyt’twa jupax ukham sañ muni.
No, he couldn't do anything.	Janiwa, jupajj janiw kuns lurkaspänti.
The big rain.	Uka jach’a jallu.
You know that by now.	Jumax jichhakamax uk yatisktawa.
I’m still learning.	Nayax wali yatxatañ munta.
Both of the.	Panpachaniw uka...
He thought that was a good thing.	Ukajj wali askïkaspas ukhamwa jupajj amuyäna.
It rarely did, but he did.	Jukʼakiw ukham luräna, ukampis jupajj ukham luräna.
Only one is visible.	Mä sapakiw uñjasi.
There are good and bad years.	Suma jan wali maranakaw utji.
You know, and that’s not it.	Jumax yatisktawa, ukat ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.
I'm going to talk to him now.	Jichhax jupamp parlir sarä.
So, what do you think of this.	Ukhama, ¿kunsa jumax aka tuqit amuyta.
He said he knew that.	Uk yattwa sasaw säna.
How long can it take.	Qhawqha tiempos ukajj pasaspa.
But he couldn't tell the truth.	Ukampis jupajj janiw cheq parlañ puedkänti.
So quickly,' he said.	Ukhamajj jankʼakiw’ sasaw säna.
I mean more or less.	Nayax juk’ampi jan ukax juk’ampi sañ munta.
I want to learn.	Nayax yatiqañ munta.
He didn’t say it wasn’t.	Janiw ukhamäkiti sasin janiw siskänti.
I would love to do that.	Nayax ukham lurañ walpun munta.
They’re not, that’s hard.	Jupanakax janiw ukhamäkiti, ukax ch’amawa.
You know too much already.	Jumax sinti yatisktawa niyaw.
Warm, crisp, delicious.	Junt’u, ch’uqi, suma.
Let’s see what you can do.	Kunsa lurañ yatta uk uñjañäni.

You’re so mean to me.	Jumax nayatakix wali jan wali jaqïtawa.
I don’t see anything from here.	Nayax janiw aka chiqat kuns uñjkti.
It just feels like it .	Ukax ukhamakiw jikxatasi .
I’m feeling sad right now.	Jichhax llakitaw jikxatastxa.
This can be an extremely long process.	Ukax mä sinti jaya pachaw lurañax utjaspa.
And it never goes away.	Ukat janipuniw sarkiti.
It all makes no sense to me.	Taqi kunas janiw kuna razonas nayatakix utjkiti.
He had none, really.	Jupax janiw kunas utjkänti, chiqpachansa.
Something was brewing.	Kunas cerveza luraskäna.
I want it so many times.	Nayajj walja kutiw uk munta.
He knows how to talk to you.	Jupajj kunjamsa jumamp parltʼañ yati.
On a positive note though.	Mä suma tuqitxa ukampis.
Everything looks brand new.	Taqi kunas mä machaq uñtatawa.
Still a while to go.	Wali mä juk’a pachaw sarañapa.
He’s just not feeling well.	Jupax jan walikïskiwa.
This was wonderful, he thought.	Akax wali sumapunïnwa, sasaw amuyäna.
There was no time.	Janiw pachax utjkänti.
She thought he was.	Jupajj ukham jaqënwa sasaw jupajj amuyäna.
But he doesn't exist.	Ukampis janiw jupajj utjkiti.
You can do better than him.	Jupat sipansa jukʼamp sumwa lurasma.
At this point he’s got to do it.	Aka pachanx jupax lurañapawa.
Someone who .	Maynix khititix .
Something told me this.	Kunas akham sasaw sitäna.
They, that is .	Jupanakax, ukax .
And there wasn’t.	Ukat janiw utjkänti.
But it will have to be done.	Ukampis lurañaw wakisini.
He does all the little things well.	Jupajj taqe jiskʼa lurañanak sumwa luri.
Do whatever you want tonight.	Jichha arumax kuntix munkta uk luram.
It’s not necessary for this.	Janiw akax wakiskiti.
Another challenge will be more immediate.	Yaqha jan waltʼäwejj jukʼamp jankʼakiw utjani.
I don’t know what the future holds.	Jutïrin kunas utjani uk janiw yatkti.
And as he watched, something happened.	Ukat uñchʼukiskäna ukhajja, kunas pasäna.
Such, .	Ukhama, .
I remember him very well.	Jupat wali sum amtasta.
It’s almost like .	Niya ukhamarakiw .
I just left it there.	Nayax ukhamakiw ukan jaytawayta.
It was one of a kind.	Ukajj mä kasta jaqënwa.
But I realized later.	Ukampis qhepatwa amuyasta.
Except of course.	Jan ukasti chiqpachansa.
Nothing, impossible.	Janiw kunas, jan lurañjamäkiti.
Better than anyone could have imagined.	Khitis amuyki ukat sipansa jukʼamp askiwa.
Eventually you need to do that.	Qhipharux ukham lurañaw wakisi.
Baseball is still nothing.	Béisbol ukanx waliw jan kunas utjkiti.
So I thought he was kind.	Ukhamajj suma chuymanïkaspas ukhamwa amuyayäta.
You’re in a weird situation.	Jumax mä muspharkañ jan walt’äwin jikxatastaxa.
Do nothing the first time.	Nayrïr kutix janiw kuns lurañamäkiti.
I really want to go back to sleep.	Nayax wasitat ikiñar sarañ wal munta.
It means everyday life.	Ukax sapa uru sarnaqañ sañ muni.
But it doesn’t do all of that.	Ukampis janiw ukanak taqe kuns lurkiti.
A quiet place.	Mä llamp’u chiqa.
I thought that was really stupid.	Nayax ukax chiqpachapuniw llamp’u chuymanïkaspas ukham amuyayäta.
There is no such question.	Janiw uka jisktʼajj utjkiti.
He wants two days.	Jupax pä uruw muni.
He never denied it.	Jupajj janipuniw uk arskänti.
I don’t have much time, really.	Nayax janiw walja tiemponïkti, chiqpachansa.
But he doesn't know how to say it.	Ukampis janiw kunjamsa uka arunak arsuñ yatkiti.
And then he sped off again.	Ukat uka qhepatjja, wasitatwa jankʼak sarjjäna.
But he seemed so genuine.	Ukampis jupajj wali cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
For that, it was pretty much all he said.	Ukatakejj niya taqe kuntï jupajj siskäna ukawa.
I have had no problems so far.	Jichhakamajj janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkituti.
There is certainly a great deal of room for improvement.	Chiqansa, jukʼamp sum lurañatakix mä jachʼa chiqaw utji.
You can do this better.	Jumax akax juk’amp sum lurasma.
And whatever he wants will happen to me.	Ukat kunatï jupajj munki ukajj nayaruw pasani.
But as you said .	Ukampis kunjamtï jumajj siskta ukhama .
So I don't know for sure.	Ukhamajj janiw sum yatkti.
Things are good and not good at the moment.	Jichha pachanx kunanakas wali askiwa ukat janiw askïkiti.
But there was one.	Ukampis mayniw utjäna.
And he loved me again.	Ukat jupajj wasitatwa nayar munasïna.
He accepted it.	Jupajj ukaruw katoqäna.
Like making a film.	Kunjamtï mä película lurañax wakiski ukhama.
He didn't want to talk to her here.	Jupajj janiw akan jupamp parltʼañ munkänti.
And most importantly, do it alone.	Ukat wali wakiskiriwa, sapakiw lurañama.
That’s all you needed.	Ukakiw jumatakix wakisïna.
And it came quickly.	Ukat jankʼakiw purinïna.
I want to see him inside you.	Nayax jupar juma manqhan uñjañ munta.
Really appreciate the house.	Chiqpachansa uka utax wali askiwa.
Another thing is to never, ever give up.	Yaqha tuqitxa, janipuniw, janipuniw jaytañamäkiti.
It doesn’t do anyone but me.	Janiw khitirus lurkiti jan ukasti naya.
No, this is the best.	Janiwa, akax wali askiwa.
It all started again.	Taqi kunas wasitatwa qalltäna.
But I feel very uncomfortable.	Ukampis nayatakejj wali jan waliw jikjjatasta.
That’s how he arrived.	Ukhamaw jupajj purinïna.
It didn’t really exist.	Janiw chiqpachapunix utjkänti.
Something the same, and a little bit more.	Kunas pachpa, ukat mä juk’a juk’ampi.
He didn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uka jan walinak lurañ munkänti.
I’m scared right now.	Nayax jichhax axsaratwa.
He left in distress.	Jupax llakitaw sarxäna.
No, he says.	Janiwa, sasaw saraki.
It’s not what we do.	Janiw kuntï lurapkta ukhamäkiti.
I don’t care at the moment.	Jichha pachanx janiw kuns lurkti.
I rarely did that.	Nayajj jukʼakiw uk lurayäta.
But there are many of them.	Ukampis walja ukanakaw utji.
So far, it works for me.	Jichhakamax, nayatakix wali askiwa.
He’s nice, but he doesn’t like me.	Jupax wali suma jaqiwa, ukampis janiw nayar munaskiti.
Didn't know much about it.	Janiw uka toqet wal yatkänti.
Manages time and resources.	Tiempo ukat yänak apnaqi.
This is going to be a great year.	Akax mä jach’a maraw utjani.
Almost everything works for me.	Niya taqe kunas nayatakejj wali askiwa.
I think it’s very difficult.	Nayax amuyta wali ch’amawa.
I could tell he loved it.	Jupajj wal munasïna uk amuyayäta.
And he wanted it so much that he didn't know why.	Ukat wal munäna, ukatwa kunatsa ukham luräna uk janiw yatkänti.
But that's what he really wanted.	Ukampis ukajj jupajj wal munäna.
There is very little we can do about it.	Uka tuqitxa wali jukʼakiw lurañax utjistu.
All was quiet last night.	Taqi kunas qhipa arumax amukiw jikxatasïna.
He always spoke very low.	Jupajj sapa kutiw wali jiskʼa arunak parläna.
You know how to live.	Jumax jakañ yatisktawa.
He’s either one or .	Jupax mä jan ukax .
I don’t get all that.	Janiw taqpach ukanak jikxatkti.
I think that’s good for you.	Nayax amuyta, ukax jumatakix wali askiwa.
He knew all this, and he didn’t care.	Taqi ukanak yatïna, ukat janiw kuns lurkänti.
He did not comment on it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet arskänti.
He shook off the idea.	Jupax uka amuyumpiw ch’allxtayäna.
That’s what he wanted to do as soon as possible.	Ukhamaw jupax jank’ak lurañ munäna.
So it’s a wonderful surprise.	Ukhamajj mä muspharkañ muspharkañawa.
It is best to act quickly.	Jankʼak kuns lurañaw wali askejja.
But it didn't mean anything more than that.	Ukampis janiw ukat sipansa jukʼamp sañ munkänti.
I like it better now.	Jichhajj jukʼamp sumwa gustitu.
And that came hard, too.	Ukat ukax wali ch’amampiw jutäna, ukhamaraki.
There’s nothing out there that isn’t for you.	Janiw kunas uka chiqanx jan jumatakix utjkiti.
Today, and every day.	Jichhürunakanxa, ukat sapa uru.
That is what is needed today.	Ukaw jichhürunakan wakisi.
I know he has a thing for me.	Nayax yattwa jupax nayatakix mä kunaw utji.
Quick now,' he said.	Jichhax jankʼakiw’ sasaw säna.
And he knew it, he worked.	Ukat jupax uk yatïna, jupax irnaqäna.
He was very affectionate with me.	Jupajj nayampejj wali munasiñampiw uñjäna.
That’s actually rather surprising.	Ukax chiqpachansa juk’amp muspharkañawa.
But then he walked behind it.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, uka qhepatwa sarnaqäna.
It is what you know.	Ukajj kuntï jumajj yatkta ukawa.
He wanted rules.	Jupajj kamachinak munäna.
I hope it’s cool.	Nayax suyt’twa ukax wali ch’amawa.
He could do anything there.	Ukanjja, kunsa luraspänwa.
Tell me exactly what is happening.	Kunas pasaski uk sum yatiyapxita.
And that is never a good thing.	Ukat ukajj janipuniw askïkiti.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Janiw jan walinak lurañ munkayätti.
I come here almost every day.	Niya sapa uruw akan jutta.

Something terrible happened to them.	Kuna jan waliw jupanakar pasäna.
I think it’s going to be a good time.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä suma pachaw utjani.
Both of them, too.	Panpachaniw, ukhamaraki.
I don’t have the money to do that.	Ukham lurañatakix janiw qullqix utjkituti.
He is young, but a fool.	Jupajj waynawa, ukampis mä loqhe jaqewa.
He knew it personally.	Jupajj sapa mayniw uk yatïna.
I may have .	Nayajj inas .
But it does it.	Ukampis uk luri.
So when I can do that again.	Ukhamajj kunapachatï mayamp ukham lurañjamäki ukhajja.
So there is nothing for that.	Ukhamajj ukatakix janiw kunas utjkiti.
And then he decided to say it anyway.	Ukat ukat kunjamatsa uk sañ amtäna.
And he certainly didn't want to do it now.	Ukat chiqpachansa janiw jichhax uk lurañ munkänti.
I think he’s been around for a while.	Nayax amuyta, jupax mä juk’a pachaw jikxatasïna.
He knew too well and knew it.	Jupajj wali sum yatïna ukat uk sum yatïna.
I want to use him.	Nayax jupar apnaqañ munta.
He needed to work harder.	Jupajj jukʼamp chʼamampiw lurañatak wakisïna.
He loves it with all his heart.	Jupajj ukanak taqe chuymaw munasi.
He didn’t want all that.	Jupax janiw taqi ukanak munkänti.
I’ve always done this wrong.	Nayax sapa kutiw ukham jan walinak lurawayta.
It was always a working lunch.	Ukax sapa kutiw irnaqäw chika uru manq’añax utjäna.
Or, it doesn't.	Jan ukajj, janiw ukham lurkiti.

I’m not, but there’s nothing I can do about it.	Nayax janiw ukhamäkti, ukampis janiw kunas uka tuqit lurañax utjkiti.
That is the most important thing.	Ukaw taqe kunat sipansa wali askejja.
He can't have it.	Jupajj janiw ukajj utjkaspati.
The first snowflake came.	Nayrïr ch’uqi ch’uqi jutäna.
I listened to it carefully.	Ukar sum istʼta.
It just started.	Jichhakiw qalltäna.
He used to be a teacher, a good teacher.	Jupax nayrax yatichiriwa, suma yatichiriwa.
I really want to buy something.	Nayax chiqpachapuniw kuns alañ munta.
Or, really, never.	Jan ukax, chiqpachansa, janipuniw ukhamäkiti.
As if he didn't know.	Janis yatkaspa ukhama.
But the problem refused.	Ukampis uka jan waltʼäwejj janiw munkänti.
It’s just what you do.	Ukax kuntix jumax lurkta ukhamakiw.
He thought he felt this way, sort of.	Jupax akham jikxatasi sasaw amuyäna, mä kasta.
I certainly wasn’t.	Nayax chiqpachansa janiw ukhamäkänti.
If you want to come with us .	Jumax nanakamp chika jutañ munsta ukhaxa .
He does part of the job well.	Jupax mä chikat lurañanak sum luri.
It’s a really lovely coffee.	Chiqpachansa wali munat café ukhamawa.
He kind of told her something.	Jupajj mä jukʼa kunsa jupar yatiyäna.
I could have done it.	Nayajj uk luraspänwa.
Not you really though.	Janiw jumax chiqpachapunix ukhamäkiti.
Of course he never told her.	Chiqansa janipuniw juparux siskänti.
He could not have done better.	Jupajj janiw jukʼamp sum lurkaspänti.
He was walking in the park alone.	Jupajj sapakiw uka parkin sarnaqäna.
Isn't that a fact.	¿Janit ukajj cheqäki.
That's what he loves.	Ukaw jupajj wal munasi.
I’ve seen it first hand myself.	Naya pachpaw nayraqat uñjta.
Nothing there, really.	Janiw kunas ukanx utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
He’s supposed to be good.	Jupax wali sumaw sañ muni.
Or maybe something deeper.	Jan ukajj inas jukʼamp manqhan kunas pasaspa.
No one wants to eat alone.	Janiw khitis sapak manqʼañ munkiti.
He did it late at night.	Ukjja wali arumaw luräna.
But he was still a good man.	Ukampis wali suma jaqënwa.
I was afraid no one understood any more.	Janiw khitis jukʼamp amuykiti sasaw ajjsarayäta.
And he asked a lot of questions.	Ukat jupajj wal jisktʼasïna.
He knew exactly what he wanted when he wanted it.	Kunapachatï munkäna ukhajj kunsa munäna uk sum yatïna.
So he knew it was now or never.	Ukhamajj jichhajj jan ukajj janipuniw ukhamäkiti uk sum yatïna.
He’s in love with me.	Jupax nayamp munasiñampiw sarnaqaski.
I’m so glad you love me so much.	Nayax walpun kusista, jumax nayat walpun munasta.

They’re better than that.	Jupanakax juk’amp askiwa.
I didn't quite understand it.	Nayajj janiw uk sum amuykayätti.
Things are hard for me right now.	Jichhajj nayatakejj kunanakas chʼamakiwa.
And how good it would be if he could make one.	Ukat kunjamsa jupajj mä luraspa ukhajja, wali askïspawa.
I can't believe it happened.	Ukajj paskäna uk janiw creykti.
It’s the same person.	Uka pachpa jaqiwa.
He planned it for years.	Jupajj walja maranakaw uk amtäna.
I mean this year, of course.	Nayax aka marax sañ munta, chiqpachansa.
It’s a woman.	Ukax warmiwa.
Me, very little.	Naya, wali juk’a.
I can only have it once.	Nayajj mä kutikiw utjaspa.
He never knew when and.	Jupajj janipuniw kunapachatï ukat...
Almost no one is.	Niya janiw khitis ukhamäkiti.
But we have to do this quietly.	Ukampis aka amukiw lurañasa.
He didn't know how or why it happened.	Kunjamsa ni kunatsa ukham pasäna uk janiw yatkänti.
This is about a week ago.	Ukax niya mä semana nayraw jikxatasi.
But he doesn't know everything.	Ukampis janiw taqe kun yatkiti.
I am glad to hear that he is a good man.	Jupajj suma jaqëtap istʼasajj wal kusista.
He didn't want to leave them.	Jupajj janiw jupanakar jaytañ munkänti.
The same seemed impossible.	Uka pachpajj jan lurañjamäkaspas ukhamänwa.
What happens here is rather strange.	Aka chiqanx kunatix luraski ukax juk’amp muspharkañawa.
A day or two later, I never knew.	Mä uru jan ukajj pä uru qhepatjja, janipuniw yatkti.

There’s our little thing to do first.	Ukanx jiwasan jisk’a lurañaw nayraqat utji.
He was more than happy to do it.	Jupajj uk lurasajj jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But really, it’s all worth it.	Ukampis chiqpachansa, taqi kunas wali askiwa.
No one liked him.	Janiw khitis jupar gustkänti.
He barely tried.	Jupajj jukʼakiw chʼamachasïna.

How did he know.	Kunjamsa jupax yatïna.
Its a living space.	Jupan mä jakañ chiqa.

I’ve done a little bit of everything.	Nayax mä juk’a taqi kuns lurawayta.
That’s what they know now.	Ukaw jichhax yatipxi.
So we went to the hospital.	Ukatwa hospitalar sarapjjta.
I saw him as a very handsome man.	Mä chachan wali suma uñnaqtʼanïkaspas ukhamwa uñjta.
But to do so, we must do it properly.	Ukampis ukham lurañatakejj sumwa lurañasa.
Everything has been great so far.	Jichhakamax taqi kunas wali sumapunïnwa.

But he has always been.	Ukampis jupajj nayratpachaw ukham sarnaqäna.
He could not speak now.	Jupajj janiw jichhajj parlañ puedkänti.

You're a bigger person.	Jumax juk'amp jach'a jaqiwa.
These, to me, are obvious.	Ukanakax, nayatakix qhanaw uñjasi.
Never again, never again, never again.	Janipuniw mayampsa, janipuniw mayampsa, janipuniw mayampsa.
Well, in this case, at least.	Ukhama, aka tuqitxa, mä juk’a.
Which he did well.	Ukjja jupajj sumwa luräna.
In a way he expected it.	Mä tuqitxa jupax ukham suyäna.
I’ve never been to a party like this.	Janiw kunapachas ukham fiestar sarkti.
He’s the one who wants me.	Jupaw nayar munta.
He saw her looking at them.	Jupajj jupanakar uñchʼukiskäna uk uñjäna.
He decided to go himself.	Jupa pachpaw sarañ amtäna.
It would take all night.	Taqi arumaw wakisispa.
He repeated himself several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jupa pachpa arsüna.
I started drinking beer.	Nayax cerveza umañ qalltawayta.
He’s the only one.	Jupan sapakiw utji.
It is waiting for you.	Ukajj jumaruw suytʼaski.

And it was wonderful for a while.	Ukat mä qhawqha tiempojj wali sumapunïnwa.

Of course, he was better than that.	Chiqansa, jupax ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumaw jikxatasïna.

Now it’s a good night.	Jichhax suma arumaw.

Maybe you don’t want to.	Inas jan munktati.
He knows he doesn't know everything.	Jupajj janiw taqe kun yatkiti uk sum yati.
It’s rather surprising here.	Aka chiqanx juk’amp muspharkañawa.
He doesn’t know where he is.	Jupax janiw kawkhans jikxatasi uk yatkiti.
This will happen many times.	Ukajj walja kutiw pasani.
He himself did not understand.	Jupa pachpajj janiw sum amuykänti.

You may need to attend a meeting.	Inas mä tantachäwir sarañax wakischispa.
It might have done all of that.	Inas taqe ukanak luraspäna.

But now this.	Ukampis jichhax aka.
There is no need to go.	Janiw sarañajj wakiskiti.
But that turned out not to be the case.	Ukampis ukajj janiw ukhamäkiti sasaw amuyasïna.
But it doesn’t have to be that way.	Ukampis janiw ukham lurañax wakiskiti.
He has no idea where he is.	Jupax janiw kawkhans jikxatasi ukx amuykiti.
Who will soon come again.	Khitis niyaw wasitat jutani.
But he did it last year.	Ukampis jupajj pasïr maraw uk luräna.
He never said how he did it.	Kunjamsa uk luräna uk janipuniw siskänti.
I'm not going anywhere.	Nayajj janiw kawkirus sarkti.

A bloody night.	Mä wila arumax.

Of course there wasn’t.	Chiqansa janiw ukax utjkänti.

You are a lovely young man.	Jumax wali munat waynawa.

And he had no problem.	Ukat jupax janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.

If you want to make one.	Mä lurañ munsta ukhaxa.

But very often, it’s not.	Ukampis wali walja kutiw, janiw ukhamäkiti.
He's a stranger to me.	Jupax mä jan uñt'at jaqiwa.

Now I see the truth.	Jichhajj kunatï cheqäki uk uñjta.
You don’t want to take it.	Jumax janiw uka apsuñ munktati.

And there is absolutely no reason to do anything wrong.	Ukat jan walinak lurañatakejj janiw kuna razonas utjkiti.
And we’ll do it ourselves.	Ukat jiwasax jiwasax lurañäni.
I know that’s not the case.	Nayax yattwa ukax janiw ukhamäkiti.

But he is a different person.	Ukampis jupajj yaqha jaqewa.

But I didn't want to talk.	Ukampis janiw parlañ munkayätti.
I can’t have anything on my own.	Janiw kunas naya pachpat utjkaspati.
He assured us that this was nothing.	Ukajj janiw kunäkisa sasaw jupajj sapjjetäna.

He is not all bad.	Jupajj janiw taqe jan walïkiti.

I really don’t have time for that.	Chiqpachansa janiw ukatakix tiempox utjkituti.
He’s waiting for a car.	Jupax mä auto suyt’aski.
So it kind of happened to him.	Ukhamajj mä jukʼa tiempow jupar pasäna.
As it stands now it doesn’t work.	Kunjamtï jichhax utjki ukax janiw irnaqkiti.
But do it yourself.	Ukampis juma pachpaw uk luram.

Let’s see how and why you should do this.	Kunjamsa ukat kunatsa ukham lurañama uk uñjañäni.

It’s not like that, it’s not.	Janiw ukhamäkiti, janiw ukhamäkiti.
But he thought it was.	Ukampis jupax ukhamänwa sasaw amuyäna.
We’ll do it later.	Jiwasax qhipharux lurañäni.

This is a long one.	Akax mä jaya jaqiwa.

And it looks terrible.	Ukat wali axsarkañ uñnaqaniwa.
Either of these two things can happen.	Uka pä tuqitxa mayniw utjaspa.

He’s faster though.	Jupax juk’amp jank’akiw ukampis.
No one knew how that could happen.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasaspa uk janiw khitis yatkänti.
He always wanted more.	Sapa kutiw jukʼamp munäna.
It’s a celebrity.	Ukax mä uñt’at jaqiwa.
I was just surprised .	Nayax ukhamakiw muspharta .
He worked there for a long time.	Jupajj walja tiempow ukan irnaqäna.

You want to take a good look at the area.	Uka chiqan sum uñjañ munasma.

Looks kind of weird to him.	Juparux mä juk’a muspharkañ uñtatawa.
Today, he refuses to talk about it.	Jichhürunakanjja, janiw uka toqet parlañ munkiti.
And now it’s time.	Ukat jichhax pachaw purini.
For me, it always came through.	Nayatakix sapa kutiw uka tuqit jutäna.

One day he said something very strange.	Mä urux wali muspharkañ arunak arsüna.

A recent trip to the hospital confirmed this.	Jichhakiw hospitalar sarañax uk chiqapar uñjäna.

He gave real help.	Jupajj cheqpach yanaptʼa churäna.
Honestly, I just can’t help it.	Chiqpachansa, nayax janiw kuns lurirjamäkti.
I never expected this to happen.	Ukham pasañap janipuniw suykayätti.
That’s how I want to see you again .	Ukhamwa jumar wasitat uñjañ munta .
Several times a day.	Urun walja kutiw ukham yatiyañama.
He had no idea what he was saying.	Kuntï siskäna ukajj janiw kunsa amuyaskänti.
No one wanted to know about it.	Janiw khitis uka toqet yatiñ munkänti.
It’s a little more weird.	Mä juk’a juk’ampi muspharkañawa.
You always say that.	Jumax sapa kutiw ukham sañ yatta.
He means everything to me.	Jupax nayatakix taqi kun sañ muni.
He was already looking at me.	Jupajj niyaw nayar uñchʼukiskäna.
But there was no reason to do so.	Ukampis janiw kuna razonas ukham lurañatakejj utjkänti.
It’s much more important, and exciting, than that.	Ukax juk’amp wakiskiriwa, ukat wali kusiskañawa, ukat sipansa.
I was totally miserable that day.	Uka urux taqpach llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
He wants to eat.	Jupax manq’añ muni.
That was the only thing he was right about.	Ukakiw jupajj cheq parläna.
Very soft, very soft! 	¡Wali llamp’u, wali llamp’u!
I didn't think that was possible.	Nayajj janiw ukham lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuykayätti.
Someone better than me.	Maynix nayat sipan juk’amp sumawa.
He wanted to do something.	Jupajj kun lurañwa munäna.

He’ll be inside for years to come.	Jupax walja maranakaw manqhan utjani.
I'm glad I didn't see that.	Uk jan uñjasajj wal kusista.
If he ever wanted a drink it was tonight.	Jupax kunapachas mä umañ munäna ukax jichha arumaw utjäna.
But for me, it is .	Ukampis nayatakejj ukajj .
There is no time to do more of these things.	Ukanakat jukʼamp lurañatakejj janiw tiempojj utjkiti.
And, he wants to do what is right.	Ukat, kunatï walïki uk lurañwa muni.
He’s always been such a nice guy.	Jupax nayratpachaw ukham suma waynax jikxatasïna.
I see things the same way.	Nayajj ukhamarakiw kuns uñjta.
But if we do, it will be worth it.	Ukampis ukham lurañäni ukhajja, wali askïspawa.
There’s something more.	Kunas juk’ampi utji.
He doesn't want to do that.	Jupajj janiw uka jan walinak lurañ munkiti.
And why is he alone? 	Ukat ¿kunatsa jupa sapaki?
He knows exactly what he wants to do.	Jupajj kun lurañsa muni uk sum yati.
It’s funny how things happened.	Kunjamsa kunas pasäna uk wali muspharkañawa.
That’s pretty cool, that’s pretty cool.	Ukax wali sumawa, ukax wali sumawa.
Now he’s awesome.	Jichhax jupax wali muspharkañawa.
Everything and nothing.	Taqi kunas ukat janiw kunas.
Nothing to do, really.	Janiw kuna lurañas utjkiti, chiqpachansa.
That first day in town.	Uka nayrïr urux markanx ukham jikxatasïna.
I’ve done three.	Nayax kimsa lurawayta.
That happened with us.	Ukajj nanakamp chikaw pasäna.
Definitely with me.	Chiqpachansa nayamp chika.
I didn’t say I liked him.	Janiw nayax juparux gustkituti siskti.
You always do it.	Jumax sapa kutiw uk lurasma.
He really wanted to make a good film.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw mä suma película lurañ munäna.
But I really don’t understand anything.	Ukampis chiqpachansa janiw kuns amuykti.
The people here are all for it.	Aka chiqanx jaqinakax taqiniw ukatakix utji.
It was, and he knew it.	Ukhamänwa, ukat jupajj uk sum yatïna.
Many, many.	Walja, walja.
More than that, he’s a lot of fun.	Ukat sipansa, jupax wali kusiskañawa.
Then he saw the photos.	Ukat uka fotonak uñjäna.
But you have to do what you want.	Ukampis kuntï munkta uk juma pachpaw lurañama.
I just wanted to take him out.	Naya sapakiw jupar apsuñ munta.
And he behaved well.	Ukat jupax wali sum sarnaqäna.
He doesn't want to do nothing with you.	Jupajj janiw jumamp jan kun lurañ munkiti.
It doesn’t matter what you do.	Kun lurañas janiw kunäkisa.
That was the first time he came.	Ukaw nayrïr kuti jutäna.
When you know, you know.	Kunapachatï yatkta ukhajja, yatisktawa.
He moved to the city.	Jupajj uka markaruw sarjjäna.
Or the adults .	Jan ukajj jilïr jaqenakajj .
Of course he has done well.	Chiqansa jupax wali sumwa lurawayi.
So he can't exist.	Ukhamajj janiw jupajj utjkaspati.
A man at home and still probably asleep.	Mä chachax utan ukat wali inas ikiskäna.
And let me know where he is now.	Ukat jichhax kawkhans jikxatasi uk yatiyapxita.
He lay there for a while and watched.	Mä jukʼa tiempow ukan ikiskäna ukat uñchʼukiskäna.
There', that's it.	Ukan', ukax ukhamawa.
The weather is just that.	Pachax ukhamakiw.
That fact alone sucked.	Uka chiqa sapakiw chuyma ch’allxtayäna.
It's never very early.	Janipuniw wali nayrajj utjkiti.
I guess I had to do that.	Ukham lurañaw wakisïna sasaw amuyta.
No reason why not.	Janiw kuna razonas kunatsa jan ukhamäkiti.
But something made him like that.	Ukampis kunas jupar ukham luratayna.
He did the driving.	Jupaw auto apnaqañ luräna.
I don't understand why he treated her so badly.	Kunatsa jupar jan walinak luräna uk janiw amuykti.
But they did not like what he was saying now.	Ukampis kuntï jichhajj siskäna ukajj janiw jupanakar gustkänti.
He didn't know how.	Janiw kunjamsa uk yatkänti.
This happened every hour.	Ukajj sapa horaw pasäna.
There was no reason to do this again.	Uka wasitat lurañatakix janiw kuna razonas utjkänti.
The guy was in trouble.	Uka waynax jan walt’äwin jikxatasïna.
Actually it looks strange.	Chiqansa ukax muspharkañ uñt’atawa.
There is a nice coffee shop.	Ukanx mä suma café ukaw utji.
I mean the most important stuff.	Nayax juk’amp wakiskir yänak sañ munta.
I don't like it, but it's fine.	Janiw nayatakejj gustkituti, ukampis walikïskiwa.
And it’s kind of .	Ukat mä kasta .
And what that means is this.	Ukat kuntï ukax sañ munki ukax akham sañ muni.
He wants it too.	Jupax uk munaraki.
Always, obviously, not never.	Sapa kutiw, qhanaw, janiw janipuniw ukhamäkänti.
He had things he needed to do.	Jupajj kunanaktï lurañapäkäna ukanakaw utjäna.
He died a long time ago.	Jupajj walja tiempo nayraw jiwjjäna.
You can do some work.	Mä jukʼa lurañanak lurasma.
It should do it for you.	Ukajj jumatak lurañapawa.
This was clearly not the case.	Ukajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukajj qhanaw amuyasi.
Finally, he walked away with great force.	Qhepatjja, wali chʼamampiw sarjjäna.
I did not expect this from you.	Nayajj janiw jumanakat uk suykayätti.
You don't want to suggest anything.	Jumax janiw kuna tuqitsa amuytʼayañ munktati.
And in terms of books.	Ukat libronak tuqitxa.
But I don’t see him doing that.	Ukampis janiw jupar ukham lurir uñjkti.
I know these things take time.	Ukanak lurañatakix tiempow munasispa uk sum yatta.
I thought that would be of interest to you.	Ukajj jumatak wali askïspawa sasaw amuyayäta.
Cracks all over the place.	Taqi chiqan ch’uqi ch’uqi.
He’s already decided.	Jupax niyaw amtawayi.
Not a room, of course.	Janiw mä cuarto ukhamäkiti, chiqpachansa.
It’s very rare .	Ukax wali juk’akiw .
In fact, it did.	Chiqansa, ukaw ukham luräna.
In fact, he did it himself.	Chiqansa, jupa pachpaw uk luratayna.
He loves you so much.	Jupajj jumat walpun munasi.
That’s what I think.	Ukhamaw nayax amuyta.
I know how it can happen.	Kunjamsa ukanak pasaspa uk sum yatta.
He’s not a nobody.	Jupax janiw khitis.
I like the old one.	Nayatakix nayrax wali askiwa.
I think it’s really important.	Chiqpachansa wali wakiskiriwa sasaw amuyta.
He talked like that .	Jupajj ukhamwa parläna .
It can have limited power.	Ukax mä jisk’a ch’amampiw utjaspa.
I don't know anything else to say about it.	Uka tuqitxa janiw yaqha tuqit arsuñ yatkti.
Who he was was nice.	Khitis jupajj wali suma jaqënwa.
And he said something.	Ukat kuns arsüna.
I'm going tonight.	Jichha arumax sarä.
Everything feels cold.	Taqi kunas thaya ukhamaw jikxatasi.
I want to use him.	Nayaw jupar apnaqañ munta.
I see myself doing this many times.	Naya pachpaw ukham walja kuti luraskta uk uñjta.
I want to give him that.	Nayajj jupar ukham churañ munta.
I never knew what to expect.	Kuntï suykayäta uk janipuniw yatkti.
I already realize that.	Nayax niyaw uk amuyasta.
Or the day before.	Jan ukajj nayrïr uru.
I am well aware of all of this.	Nayajj taqe ukanakat sum yatta.
I am not going to get married.	Nayajj janiw casarasiñatak sarkäti.
What he wanted.	Kuntï jupajj munkäna ukajja.
So that’s it .	Ukhamajj ukhamawa .
He wondered how that happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna sasaw jisktʼasïna.
It’s funny here.	Aka chiqanx wali muspharkañawa.
It is a beautiful thing to do.	Ukham lurañajj wali sumawa.
He looked very happy himself.	Jupa pachpajj wali kusisitaw uñnaqäna.
Don’t give up the gift.	Janiw uka regalo jaytañamäkiti.
You know, it’s funny.	Jumax yatisktawa, wali muspharkañawa.
It means the truth.	Chiqa sañ muni.
It can’t be the first time.	Janiw nayrïr pachax utjkaspati.
I want to give you a little cry.	Nayax mä jisk’a jach’a jach’a tukuñ munta.
There’s not enough time.	Janiw mä juk’a pachax utjkiti.
I love eating it.	Nayax uka manq’añax walpun munta.
But it hasn’t worked for me yet.	Ukampis janiw jichhakamax nayatakix askïkiti.
But not again for years after that.	Ukampis uka qhepatjja, walja maranakaw jan mayampsa.
Really and truly .	Chiqpachansa ukat chiqpachapuniw .
And another party.	Ukat yaqha fiesta.
That's what he got.	Ukaw jupajj katoqäna.
I think that’s pretty much everyone here.	Nayax amuyta ukax niya taqiniw akan utji.
Not what he wanted.	Janiw kuntï jupajj munkäna ukat sipansa.
We still have to make one.	Jiwasax wali ch’amampiw mä lurañasa.
But that happened in the middle of the day.	Ukampis ukajj chika uruw pasäna.
He would have no choice.	Jupajj janiw kuna lurañas utjkaspati.
He knows how it happened.	Kunjamsa ukajj pasäna uk jupajj sum yati.
He will love it.	Jupax walpun munasini.
Except he pretty much does it.	Jan ukasti jupax niya ukhamakiw luraski.
But never again.	Ukampis janipuniw mayampsa.
In this one he has a guitar, of course.	Aka maynix jupax guitarra ukaniwa, chiqpachansa.
Make them part of you.	Jupanakar jumamp chika luram.
Two days later, nothing.	Pä urunak qhepatjja, janiw kunäkisa.
Eventually, this became clear.	Qhepatjja, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
Still heavy rain, heavy rain.	Wali jach’a jallu, jach’a jallu.
He didn’t want to.	Janiw munkänti.
This is better that it’s worth it.	Akax juk’amp askiwa ukax wali askiwa.
He refused to admit it to himself.	Jupajj janiw jupa pachpajj uk iyaw sañ munkänti.
Do what he did.	Kuntï jupajj lurkäna uk luram.
But he doesn’t want to go out again.	Ukampis janiw wasitat mistuñ munkiti.
He’s a very happy man, too.	Jupax wali kusisit jaqiwa, ukhamaraki.
But now, obviously, he is.	Ukampis jichhax, qhanaw, jupax ukhamawa.
You have to do something about him.	Jupat kuns lurañamawa.
I need to tell you about this yourself.	Nayax juma pachpaw aka tuqit yatiyañama.
You don’t want to see me.	Janiw nayar uñjañ munkti.
The biggest problem was inaction.	Jachʼa jan waltʼäwejj jan kuns lurañaw utjäna.
You may need some help.	Inas mä jukʼa yanaptʼa wakischispa.
I don’t really know when.	Nayax janiw chiqpachapunix kunapachas uk yatkti.
The snow and the snow.	Ch’uqi ukat ch’uqi.
Don't do anything here.	Janiw akan kuns luramti.
He didn’t know what anyone wanted.	Jupax janiw kuntï khitis munkäna uk yatkänti.
I know, of course.	Nayax yattwa, chiqpachansa.
That’s right, he thought.	Ukhamawa, sasaw amuyäna.
I wonder about it myself.	Naya pachpaw uka toqet jisktʼasta.
But you are the only one I still remember.	Ukampis juma sapakiw wali amtaskta.
Breakfast was excellent.	Desayuno wali suma.
He said it was painfully wrong.	Ukax wali llakitaw jan waliw sasaw säna.
So we have to do it together.	Ukatwa mayachtʼasis lurañasa.
And today.	Ukat jichhürunakanxa.
The cost of doing this is .	Uka lurañatakix qullqix .
Do this while walking.	Sarkasajj uk lurañamawa.
I don’t see any reason.	Janiw kuna razonas uñjkti.
Where there is nothing, there is nothing.	Kawkhantï jan kunas utjki ukanjja, janiw kunas utjkiti.
He looked very lonely.	Jupax wali sapakiw uñnaqäna.
It doesn't matter.	Janiw ukajj kuns lurkiti.
Later that afternoon, he reported an incident.	Qhepatjja, uka tardejj mä jan waltʼäwit yatiyäna.
And he made no secret of who he was.	Ukat khitïnsa uk janiw mä jamasat yatkänti.
You don’t want to do that.	Jumax janiw ukanak lurañ munktati.
It 's a very nice	Ukax wali sumawa .
It was no problem for me.	Nayatakix janiw kuna jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
Today was another day.	Jichhürojj yaqha uruw utjäna.
He didn't feel real.	Jupajj janiw cheqpach jaqëkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
If you want to go.	Jumax sarañ munsta ukhaxa.
He talked a lot about success.	Jupajj sum sarnaqañ toqet wal parläna.
Someone kept a close eye on the night.	Maynix arumax wali sum uñjäna.
A scary one, for sure.	Mä axsarkañ mä, chiqpachansa.
So obviously he feels good about himself.	Ukhamajj qhanaw jupa pachpat wali sum jikjjatasi.
He threw it into place.	Jupajj uka cheqar jaqontäna.
It took me a while to get through it.	Uka tuqitxa mä jukʼa tiempow munasïna.
Now, for the first time, he knew how to be unhappy.	Jichhajj nayrïr kutiw jan kusisit sarnaqañ yatïna.
It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Janiw wakiskiti, janiw kunas wakiskiti.
It’s almost like that.	Niya ukhamawa.
No, but .	Janiwa, ukampis .
After all, everything is there, everywhere.	Chiqansa, taqi kunaw utji, kawkhans utji.
It can be both ways.	Panpachaniw ukax utjaspa.
He thought it was true.	Jupajj cheqapuniw sasaw amuyäna.
He couldn't let that happen.	Jupajj janiw ukham pasañap jaytañ puedkänti.
I have none, really.	Nayax janiw kunas utjkituti, chiqpachansa.
And that’s always good.	Ukat ukax sapa kutiw wali askïspa.
I’ve done very bad things.	Nayax wali jan walinak lurawayta.
He was happier than she was.	Jupajj jupat sipansa jukʼamp kusisitaw jikjjatasïna.
But one thing at a time.	Ukampis mä kutin mä kunaw utji.
I’m really enjoying it so far.	Chiqpachansa jichhakamax wali kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
He looked serious.	Jupajj wali amuyumpiw uñnaqäna.
But I can do it anyway.	Ukampis kunjamatsa uk lurasmati.
But you weren't like that.	Ukampis janiw jumajj ukhamäkänti.
But to her surprise, he didn't say anything.	Ukampis jupajj janiw kuns arskänti, ukajj wal muspharäna.
This was especially needed.	Ukajj jukʼampiw munasïna.
Another man .	Yaqha chachax .
I can’t believe it .	Janiw iyaw sañjamäkiti .
I think we absolutely have to.	Nayax amuyta, jiwasax chiqpachapuniw lurañasa.
I’m not entirely sure what that could be.	Kunas ukax utjaspa ukx janiw taqpach yatkti.
He is very careful about what he says.	Kuntï siski uk wali amuyumpiw luraski.
Or, so he thought.	Jan ukajj, ukhamwa amuyäna.
It has a whole new look.	Ukax mä machaq uñnaqaniwa.
Of course I know.	Chiqpachansa nayax yattwa.
It was obvious that he really wanted to.	Jupajj cheqapuniw munäna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
And yes, he was real.	Ukat jïsa, jupajj cheqpach jaqënwa.
He could do it later.	Jupajj qhepatwa uk luraspäna.
And that was all that was needed.	Ukat ukakiw wakisïna.
That, too, was a new piece of advice.	Ukajj ukhamarakiw mä machaq ewjjtʼäna.
The young man refused.	Uka waynax janiw iyaw siskänti.
If you are looking for the best in class.	Jumatix clasen juk’amp suma thaqhaskta ukhaxa.
I never knew that.	Janiw kunapachas uk yatkayätti.
I never thought he was that type of person.	Janipuniw jupajj uka kasta jaqëkaspas ukham amuyirïkti.
He couldn't drive home.	Jupajj janiw autot utar sarañ puedkänti.
I loved it then, and I love it now.	Uka tiemponjja, walpun munasta, jichhajj walpun munasta.
I don’t need to eat now.	Jichhax janiw manq’añax wakiskiti.
But he wanted to do that.	Ukampis ukham lurañwa munäna.
I don't want to rush you.	Janiw nayajj jumar jankʼak lurañ munkti.
He literally means every word.	Jupax chiqpachapuniw sapa arunak sañ muni.
Very nice, she says.	Wali sumawa, sasaw jupax saraki.
I won’t do anything else.	Janiw yaqha ukham lurkäti.
I mean that in a positive way.	Nayajj mä suma toqetwa uk sañ munta.
No, at least .	Janiwa, mä jukʼa .
Really and truly.	Chiqpachansa ukat chiqpachansa.
He felt better in the morning.	Jupajj alwaw wali sum jikjjatasïna.
As he said, there was more.	Kunjamtï jupajj siskäna ukajj jukʼampiw utjäna.
The coffee is excellent.	Uka café ukax wali sumawa.
I’m afraid it isn’t.	Nayax axsaratwa janiw ukhamäkiti.

She was looking at him with a lot of love.	Jupajj wali munasiñampiw jupar uñchʼukiskäna.
Also, very nice.	Ukhamaraki, wali suma.
Not too many people know that.	Janiw sinti walja jaqenakajj uk yatipkiti.
Now it’s time to do something.	Jichhax kun lurañ pachaw purini.
I still have a hard time with this.	Nayax wali ch’amampiw aka tuqitx jikxatasi.
But it is better than that.	Ukampis ukat sipansa jukʼamp sumawa.
He immediately outspoken me.	Jupajj jankʼakiw nayat sipansa jukʼamp sum arsüna.
That’s if you want him.	Ukax jumatix jupar munsta ukhaxa.
I’m rather excited about it.	Nayax uka tuqitx juk’amp kusisitaw jikxatastxa.
But the big money isn’t.	Ukampis jach’a qullqix janiw.
And he was most definitely right.	Ukat jupax jukʼamp chiqaw säna.
Twice he refused.	Pä kutiw jan munkänti.
And before too long.	Ukat janïr sinti jaya tiempo.
He wanted this.	Jupax aka munäna.
But everyone needs to do that.	Ukampis taqeniw ukham lurañajj wakisi.
But that wasn't the case for me.	Ukampis janiw nayatakejj ukhamäkänti.
It took another two weeks.	Ukatakejj yaqha pä semanaw munasïna.
There weren’t many good people.	Janiw walja suma jaqinakax utjkänti.
He is nothing now.	Jichhajj janiw jupajj kunäkisa.
He wasn't, but he was.	Jupajj janiw ukhamäkänti, ukampis jupajj ukhamänwa.
Dinner didn't take long.	Manqʼa manqʼañatakejj janiw walja tiempojj munkänti.
You shouldn’t do that.	Jumax jan uk lurañamawa.
It doesn’t have to be done.	Janiw lurañax wakiskiti.
I went to the party a while ago.	Mä juk’a pachaw uka fiestar sarawayta.
Building a house is good for you.	Uta lurañax jumatakix wali askiwa.
That lasted about ten years.	Ukajj niya tunka maranakaw utjäna.
More than twice, actually.	Pä kuti jila, chiqpachansa.
I don’t find anything strange.	Nayax janiw kuns muspharkañ jikxatkti.
It’s cold in the winter.	Juyphi pachanx wali thaya.

We have only one.	Mä sapakiw utjistu.
I doubt if I should do anything.	Kun lurañas wakisispati janicha uk pächastwa.
So it looked lovely.	Ukhamajj wali munasiñampiw uñnaqäna.
It was like two people.	Ukajj pä jaqëkaspas ukhamänwa.
They know all the languages.	Jupanakax taqi arunak yatipxi.
He immediately threw the idea away.	Jupajj jankʼakiw uka amtar jaqontäna.
He wasn't sure if it was right.	Jupajj janiw walikïskiti janicha uk sum yatkänti.
Everything is going.	Taqi kunas saraski.

It didn’t matter who was .	Janiw kunas khitis utjkänti .
I really want to know.	Chiqpachansa nayax yatiñ munta.

He loves to come.	Jupajj jutañ wal muni.
He’s had a great year.	Jupax wali suma maraw jikxatasïna.
They do not know the truth.	Kunatï cheqäki uk janiw yatipkiti.
He lives more alone.	Jupajj jukʼamp sapakiw jakasi.
You can’t do it with anyone.	Janiw khitimpis lurañjamäkiti.
It leaves you alone.	Ukax sapak jaytawayi.
He hurried to the exit.	Jupax jank’akiw mistuñ chiqar saräna.
Small, soft, too.	Jisk’a, llamp’u, ukhamaraki.
And people know stuff.	Ukat jaqinakax yänak yatipxi.
There will be plenty of time to do this.	Uk lurañatakix walja tiempow utjani.
I’m sorry, she says.	Nayax llakistwa, sasaw jupax saraki.
I was so sad tonight.	Jichha arumax wali llakitaw jikxatasiyäta.
And that’s what’s happening.	Ukat ukax ukhamarakiw pasaski.
We have wind power here.	Jiwasax thaya ch’amampiw akanx utjistu.
He lives alone.	Jupa sapakiw jakasi.
That’s how .	Ukaw kunjamsa .
But it’s still difficult.	Ukampis wali ch’amawa.
How to do it.	Kunjamsa lurañapa.
Not really, and certainly not financially.	Janiw chiqpachansa, ukat chiqpachansa janiw qullqi tuqitxa.
It 's a very nice	Ukajj wali sumawa .
I really want to give it up once and for all.	Chiqpachansa, mä kutikiw uk jaytañ munta.
And he began to do well.	Ukat jupajj sum lurañwa qalltäna.
He spent a huge amount.	Jupajj wali jachʼa qollqe apsüna.
A little heavy but it worked well.	Mä juk’a jach’a ukampis wali sum irnaqäna.
I think it will cost some money.	Nayax amuyta, ukax mä qawqha qullqis utjani.
Of course you were.	Chiqansa jumax ukhamänwa.

I was very surprised by his.	Jupan ukajj walpun muspharta.
The location is perfect for everything except the weather.	Uka chiqanx taqi kunas wali askiwa, jan ukasti pachax wali askiwa.
I mean drinking in it.	Ukan umañ sañ munta.
He didn't want much of it, anyway.	Jupajj janiw sinti ukanak munkänti, kunjamatsa.
So far, I haven’t been able to do that.	Jichhakamax janiw ukham lurañjamäkiti.
This is actually quite exciting.	Chiqansa akax wali kusiskañawa.
That’s all we have at the moment.	Ukakiw jichha tiempon utjistu.
It’s not a regular year.	Janiw sapa kuti marax utjkiti.
He was unusually quiet.	Jupax jan uñt’at amukiw jikxatasïna.
He wanted what he had.	Jupajj kunatï jupan utjki uk munäna.
And he called her several times.	Ukat walja kutiw jawsäna.
I’m going wholeheartedly.	Nayax taqi chuymaw saraskta.
Me, of sorts.	Nayax, mä kasta.
I did nothing yesterday.	Nayajj janiw qharürojj kuns lurkti.
Someone got there first.	Mayniw nayraqat uka cheqar purinïna.
He was with us the whole time.	Jupajj taqe tiempow nanakamp chika sarnaqäna.
Never, really.	Janiw kunapachas, chiqpachansa.
I love it so much!!!.	Nayax walpun munasta!!!.
I don’t want to be without him.	Janiw jupamp jan sarnaqañ munkti.
I couldn’t find the stone anywhere.	Janiw kawkhans uka qala jikxatkti.
But that wasn't even the problem.	Ukampis janiw ukajj uka jan waltʼäwis utjkänti.
It doesn’t exist in him.	Janiw jupan utjkiti.
Two or three, yes.	Pä jan ukax kimsa, jïsa.
What he says about you.	Kunsa jupajj jumat siski.
I know what it takes to do this.	Uk lurañatakix kunas wakisi uk sum yatta.
That’s never necessary.	Ukax janipuniw wakiskiti.
He bought her several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw jupar alasïna.
We’ll see tomorrow.	Qharüruw uñjañäni.
That’s amazing to me.	Ukax nayatakix muspharkañawa.
He’s definitely .	Jupax chiqpachapuniw .
I know very well how and where.	Kunjamsa ukat kawkhansa wali sum yatta.
I never liked that.	Ukajj janipuniw nayarojj gustkituti.
It was something he was obsessed with.	Ukajj jupajj walpun uñchʼukiskäna.
Now he did so with force.	Jichhajj chʼamampiw ukham luräna.
The sooner he did it, the better.	Jupajj jankʼak lurkäna ukhajja, jukʼamp askiwa.
He barely does anything.	Jupajj jukʼakiw jan kuns luri.
It was a one-off.	Ukajj mä kutikiw utjäna.
This time it was a little better.	Aka kutix mä juk’a sumaw jikxatasïna.
He didn't want that much.	Jupajj janiw ukham sinti munkänti.
He was too afraid to leave her in town.	Jupajj markan jaytañ wal ajjsaräna.
And what is that thing you do.	Ukat kunas uka kuns lurañama.
I’m going to drink it.	Nayax ukaruw umañ munta.
Let me know if you need a job.	Mä irnaqäw munasmati uk yatiyapxita.
It’s a whole time .	Ukax mä taqpach pachan .
It was a wonderful day!.	¡Uka urux wali sumapunïnwa!.
He could have done everything very well.	Jupajj taqe kunsa wali sumwa luraspäna.
You know, it’s not that bad.	Jumax yatisktawa, janiw ukham jan walïkiti.
All of these don’t work.	Taqi ukanakax janiw irnaqkiti.
How beautiful beautiful beautiful.	Kunjamsa wali suma suma suma.
I don’t really care right now.	Jichhax janiw chiqpachapunix kuns lurañ munkti.
No one is bad these days.	Aka urunakanx janiw khitis jan walïkiti.
But as always, he was right.	Ukampis kunjamtï nayrajj lurkäna ukhama, jupajj cheqapuniw säna.
Or you can do something first.	Jan ukajj nayraqat kuns lurasma.
I am so happy with the results.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi uk uñjasajj wal kusista.
Or why it happened.	Jan ukajj kunatsa ukham pasäna.
To which he said yes.	Ukax jupax jïsa sasaw säna.
I know, we were.	Nayax yattwa, jiwasax ukhamänwa.
He had looked at it several times.	Jupajj walja kutiw uka toqet uñchʼukiskäna.
He wants photos.	Jupax fotonak munaraki.
I want to buy another one.	Nayax yaqha alañ munta.
Lunch got to me today.	Chika uru manq’añax jichhürunakanx nayaruw puri.
But he is happier here.	Ukampis jupajj jukʼamp kusisitaw aka cheqan jikjjatasi.
He didn't tell her that.	Jupajj janiw uk jupar arskänti.
I'm still looking for that old one.	Nayax wali uka nayra thaqhaskta.
In fact, he already has.	Chiqansa, jupax nayratpach ukham lurawayi.
I want to go back to sleep.	Nayax wasitat ikiñar sarañ munta.
It didn’t mean that, but it was.	Janiw ukham sañ munkänti, ukampis ukhamänwa.
Wherever he went.	Kawkirus saräna.
Because there’s nothing to it.	Kunatix janiw kunas ukax utjkiti.
I saw another one this morning, actually.	Jichha alwax yaqha uñjta, chiqpachansa.
And this may be the case for me.	Ukat akax nayatakix ukhamarakiw utjaspa.
He knows that this is not the right time.	Janiw uka tiempojj walïkiti uk jupajj sum yati.
I know exactly where he is now.	Jichhajj kawkhansa jikjjatasi uk sum yatta.
This is interesting, of course.	Akax wali askiwa, chiqpachansa.
And you can definitely afford it.	Ukat chiqpachapuniw uka qullqix utjaspa.
It’s funny .	Ukax wali muspharkañawa .
But he didn't want to see the truth.	Ukampis janiw kunatï cheqäki uk uñjañ munkänti.
That’s what we have to do.	Ukaw lurañasa.
I myself did not go this time.	Naya pachpajj janiw jichha kutin sarkti.
There’s a lot of power in that alone.	Uka sapakix walja ch’amaw utji.
He must act on his own or do nothing.	Jupa pachpaw kuns lurañapa jan ukax jan kuns lurañapawa.
I see this in a negative light.	Nayax jan wali amuyumpiw uk uñjta.
But that could take years.	Ukampis ukham lurañatakejj walja maranakaw munasispa.
I want that to stay.	Nayax uka qhiparañ munta.
That was all in the past.	Ukajj taqe kunaw nayra tiempon utjäna.
Which he was willing to do.	Ukajj jupajj taqe chuymaw lurañ amtäna.
Very rarely is that much.	Wali juk’akiw ukax sinti jach’a.
He served three years.	Jupax kimsa maraw irnaqäna.
And besides, it’s none of your business.	Ukat ukat sipansa, janiw jumanakan lurañamäkiti.
It hasn't been that way for a while.	Mä qawqha tiempojj janiw ukhamäkiti.
Also a little red as well.	Ukhamaraki mä juk’a wila ukhamaraki.
I am so happy to hear that.	Uk istʼasajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasta.
He really loved the city.	Jupax chiqpachansa markarux walpun munasïna.
And of course it doesn’t matter.	Ukat chiqansa janiw kunas wakiskiti.
It’s worth it, it’s worth the money.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukax qullqix wali askiwa.
You are a fool.	Jumax mä loqhe jaqiwa.
Everything was surprisingly smooth.	Taqi kunas muspharkañ sumaw jikxatasïna.
But that was it .	Ukampis ukajj ukhamänwa .
He wants to see her alone again.	Jupajj wasitat sapak uñjañ muni.
You play the piano.	Jumax piano tocañ yatta.
He spent a lot of time away.	Walja tiempow jaya cheqan sarnaqäna.
You have a soft sleep or something.	Jumax mä llamp’u ikiñan jan ukax kunas.
Let’s see what happens to them.	Kunas jupanakar pasani uk uñjañäni.
More power to you in this case.	Juk’amp ch’amaw jumatakix aka tuqitxa.
And what did he say.	Ukat kuns säna.
I understand you better.	Nayajj jumat jukʼamp sum amuyta.
I don’t have time for all that.	Janiw taqi ukanak lurañatakix tiemponïkti.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Nayax yatxatwa jupax wali sum lurani.
The weather is good in the area today.	Jichhürunakanx uka chiqanx pachax wali askiwa.
He almost took mine.	Jupajj niyaw nayan apsüna.
I see great things.	Nayax jach’a yänak uñjta.
So, yeah, I have a great time.	Ukhama, jïsa, mä jachʼa tiempow utjitu.
Almost the same thing happened again.	Niya ukhamarakiw wasitat pasäna.
I don’t know how to do anything else.	Janiw yaqha lurañ yatkti.
That’s good, but it’s very uncomfortable.	Ukax wali askiwa, ukampis wali jan waliw uñjasi.
There’s another little thing.	Yaqha jisk’a kunas utji.
Maybe this needs to be done a little faster.	Inas akax mä juk’a jank’ak lurañax wakischispa.
But there was more to it.	Ukampis jukʼampiw uka toqet parläna.
He noticed her reactions.	Jupajj jupar uñjasajj kunjamsa kuns luri uk amuyasïna.
You think about this.	Jumax aka tuqit amuyta.
But it almost went away.	Ukampis niya ukhamakiw sarjjäna.
I know what you want.	Nayax yattwa kuntix jumax munkta uk.
A smaller kind, badly cold, but still.	Mä jisk’a kasta, jan wali thaya, ukampis wali.
I was surprised at how I felt about it.	Uka toqet kunjamsa jikjjatasta uk uñjasajj wal muspharta.
It’s really a big surprise.	Chiqpachansa mä jach’a muspharkañawa.
It is what a man did.	Kuntï mä jaqejj lurkäna ukawa.
So you have to do it for him.	Ukhamajj jupatak lurañamawa.
But he wants to do more.	Ukampis jukʼamp lurañwa muni.
He could not do it alone.	Jupajj janiw sapaki uk lurañ puedkänti.
He looks a little bigger to me every morning.	Jupax sapa alwaw nayatakix mä juk’a jach’a uñtasi.
It was almost overnight.	Niya mä arumaw pasäna.
I want to say three things.	Kimsa arunak arsuñ munta.
He squeezed it a little.	Jupax mä juk’a ch’allt’äna.
He’ll do something.	Jupaw kuns lurani.
It feels better now.	Jichhax juk’amp sumaw jikxatasi.
And he thought he had found something.	Ukat kuns jikjjatasta sasaw amuyäna.
That's what it feels like.	Ukajj kunjamsa jikjjatasi ukjja.
He was obviously excited.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jikjjatasïna, ukajj qhanaw amuyasïna.
I didn’t want to drink that water.	Janiw uka uma umañ munkayätti.
A non-cold day.	Mä jan thaya uru.
Red blood red.	Wila wila wila.
He drives an airplane.	Jupax mä avión apnaqi.
He arrived today.	Jupax jichhüruw purini.
Anything seemed better than that.	Kunas ukat sipansa jukʼamp askïkaspas ukhamänwa.
He loves soft things.	Jupax llamp’u yänak wal munasi.
I like this world a lot.	Aka pachax walpun gustitu.
There was something else to do.	Yaqha yaqha lurañaw utjäna.
If you want to use it, do so.	Uka apnaqañ munsta ukhaxa, ukham lurañamawa.
That’s the only thing he needs to do first.	Ukakiw nayraqat lurañapa.
He could not eat breakfast that morning.	Uka alwajj janiw desayuno manqʼañ puedkänti.
It won’t be overnight.	Janiw mä arumax utjkaniti.
I love doing that.	Uk lurañajj nayatakejj walpun gustitu.
A straight line.	Mä chiqa chiqa.
I want to do something.	Nayax mä kun lurañ munta.
And you know the game.	Ukat jumax uka anattʼañ yatisktawa.
Should do for a couple of days.	Mä pä uruw lurañapa.
It will be available for a while.	Ukax mä juk’a pachaw utjani.
There was not much time left .	Janiw walja tiempojj utjkänti .
I know what he has to do next.	Uka qhepat kunsa lurañapa uk nayajj yattwa.
This obviously took time.	Ukatakejj tiempow munasïna, ukajj qhanawa.
I went to the hospital twice.	Pä kutiw hospitalar sarawayta.
He didn't think about it.	Jupajj janiw uka toqet amuykänti.
I’m going to use this as a learning experience.	Nayax akax mä yatiqañ utar uñtasit apnaqañ munta.
This is very frequent.	Ukax wali sapa kutiw utji.
I look forward to more of these.	Ukanakat jukʼamp suytʼaskta.
There’s something really weird.	Chiqpachansa mä muspharkañ kunaw utji.
He is better the other way around.	Jupajj yaqha tuqitxa jukʼamp askiwa.
He was reluctant, but he did it anyway.	Jupajj janiw munkänti, ukampis kunjamatsa uk luräna.
But he wants nothing to do with her.	Ukampis janiw jupamp kuns lurañ munkiti.
What can you do?	Kunsa lurasma.
After what had happened earlier, he felt better.	Kunatï nayrajj paskäna uka qhepatjja, wali sumwa jikjjatasïna.
So very, very sad.	Ukhamajj wali, wali llakitaw jikjjatasta.
He didn't feel like he could do anything.	Jupajj janiw kunsa lurañjamäkaspas ukham amuyaskänti.
There’s something about it that he doesn’t understand.	Uka tuqitxa mä kunaw utji, jupax janiw amuykiti.
He was so happy he loved her so much.	Jupajj wali kusisitaw jupar wal munäna.
You only have to do this once.	Mä kutikiw uka lurañax lurañama.
Again, longer, longer.	Wasitat sipansa jukʼamp tiempow jukʼamp tiempo.
This was not the case before.	Ukajj janiw nayrajj ukhamäkänti.
Choose your own room.
