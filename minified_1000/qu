He’s too good not to be.	Payqa ancha allinmi mana kananpaq.
At a party.	Huk fiestapi.
I had never seen that before, so I was very surprised.	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu, chaymi anchata admirakurqani.
Something good in a bad time.	Mana allin pachapi imapas allin kaq.
He sounds worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam uyarikun.
Do the same thing.	Chaynata ruway.
He can do this job.	Payqa kay llamk’ayta ruwanman.
So proud of it.	Chayna orgulloso.
Actually, he's not a very nice guy.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa manam ancha sumaq runachu.
Just one morning.	Chayllaraqmi huk paqarin.
I couldn’t understand what was going on there.	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
You can’t say it’s ugly.	Manam millay kasqanmanta niyta atiwaqchu.
Anyway, it wasn't very good.	Imayna kaptinpas manam ancha allinchu karqa.
But you are a human being.	Ichaqa qamqa runam kanki.
It was a beautiful summer day.	Sumaq verano punchawmi karqa.
I don't want to see what's going on now.	Manam munanichu kunan imakuna kasqanmanta qawayta.
He had no idea where.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi chayta.
I mean it’s obvious.	Sut’inmi niyta munani.
I don't know what's wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
There is no point in doing almost anything.	Mana valenchu ​​yaqa imatapas ruwayqa.
A date was set.	Huk p’unchaymi churasqa karqan.
There is no reason for that.	Chaypaqqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
I’m sorry, but I’m not.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa manan.
Obviously, that would take some time.	Sut’inmi, chaypaqqa huk tiempon kanman.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
They were serious.	Paykunaqa serio karqanku.
He was there anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas chaypim karqa.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
So, really, please.	Chaymi, chiqaptapuni, ama hina kaspa.
It was a morning like this.	Kay hina paqarinmi karqa.
I would have done that.	Chaynatam ruwayman karqa.
Angry was good.	Phiñasqa allin kasqa.
Now that’s great.	Kunanqa chayqa ancha allinmi.
I can't believe it's mine.	Manam creeyta atinichu ñuqapa kasqanmantaqa.
I want to be with him more.	Astawan paywan kayta munani.
But the process continues.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
It was last year.	Qayna wata karqan.
He is a very famous man.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa runam.
It was a lonely one.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqa.
He looked at her.	Payqa qhawarisqa.
And, you know, he's right.	Hinaspa, yachanki, payqa allintam rimachkan.
A month and no more.	Huk killa hinaspa manaña.
Or a bad guy.	Utaq mana allin runa.
This or nothing.	Kay icha mana ima.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
So I had to be.	Chaymi kanay karqa.
I want to do this like him.	Pay hinam kayta ruwayta munani.
They are safe.	Paykunaqa segurom kanku.
I don't understand this.	Kaytaqa manam entiendenichu.
About an hour and a half ago.	Yaqa huk hora kuskan ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I couldn’t eat that.	Chaytaqa manan mikhuyta atirqanichu.
That is the worst thing you can do.	Chayqa aswan mana allin ruwaymi.
We can’t let this happen.	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atichwanchu.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
That wasn’t true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
It was great to have her in her home.	Ancha hatunmi karqa wasinpi paywan kayqa.
But it is not true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu.
And they were, indeed.	Hinaspa paykunaqa karqanku, cheqaqtapuni.
I don’t know if that will get the job done, but maybe it will.	Mana yachanichu chaywanqa chay llamk’ayta ruwanqachu icha manachu chayta, ichaqa ichapas chayna kanman.
That’s amazing .	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi .
But don’t let that matter.	Ichaqa ama chaytaqa imananpaschu.
That he didn’t want to understand.	Mana entiendeyta munasqanmanta.
I have a good sense of humor.	Ñuqaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
This couldn’t be more true.	Kayqa manan aswan cheqaqchu kanman.
I was really proud of him.	Cheqaqtapunin paymanta orgulloso karqani.
That is!.	¡Kaymi!.
I wanted this to be addressed as soon as possible.	Kayta usqhaylla qhawarisqa kananta munarqani.
But it is very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi.
That would certainly work.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allinta ruwanman.
That’s it.	Chayqa.
You’re probably thinking.	Yaqapaschá yuyaykunki.
I have never done this before.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
She says, these are very nice.	Payqa nin, kaykunaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I will never be able to do this right.	Manam haykapipas kayta allinta ruwayta atisaqchu.
Soon people were confused.	Pisi tiempollamantan runakunaqa pantasqa karqanku.
It knows the story you want to hear.	Uyariyta munasqayki willakuyta yachan.
Hopefully it will happen soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla pasananta.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatunmi karqa.
So he doesn't know what you look like.	Chaymi payqa mana yachanchu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqaykita.
One day I want to be that person.	Huk punchawmi chay runa kayta munani.
They are hidden people.	Paykunaqa pakasqa runakunam.
He told me to.	Paymi niwarqa.
That’s a process.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi.
It was a tragic experience.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa.
But it is not easy to do so.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chayta ruwayqa.
But not much longer.	Ichaqa manan aswan unaytachu.
What was the wrong thing?	¿Imataq mana allinchu karqa?
Now I know what it is.	Kunanmi yachani ima kasqanmanta.
Twice a week.	Semanapi iskay kutita.
Which means, it’s really bad.	Imataq niyta munan, chiqamanta mana allinchu.
Why do you want to do this?	¿Imanasqataq kayta ruwayta munanki?
The truth of the matter.	Chiqap kaq.
That’s some of the secret.	Chayqa wakin pakasqa.
Yes, it’s beautiful.	Arí, sumaqmi.
Probably because of its popularity.	Yaqapaschá chayna ancha riqsisqa kasqanmanta.
A senseless act.	Mana yuyayniyuq ruway.
Lots to do out here.	Achka ruwanapaq kaypi hawapi.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Don’t do that.	Ama chaytaqa ruwaychu.
I mean, he tried.	Niyta munani, payqa kallpachakurqanmi.
I was quite proud of it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa allintam chaymantaqa orgulloso karqani.
He tried to avoid it but there was nothing he could do.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi mana chayta ruwananpaq ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I want to tell you this.	Kayta willayta munani.
I can't find anything else.	Manam hukta tarinichu.
You knew that.	Chaytaqa yacharqanki.
He took it out.	Chayta hurqurqa.
He has no choice.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
It’s very easy.	Ancha facilmi.
You can’t tell.	Manam yachayta atiwaqchu.
I want a party.	Fiestata munani.
He has no reason to.	Payqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
It would have been great to talk more.	Ancha allinmi kanman karqan astawan rimayqa.
I really want him to be here.	Anchatam munani kaypi kananta.
You don’t want to hear this.	Kaytaqa manam uyariyta munankichu.
That is a very difficult task.	Chayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
I feel very comfortable here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam tarikuni.
So here it was.	Chaymi kaypi karqa.
More time with him.	Aswan tiempo paywan.
Please don’t overdo it.	Ama hina kaspa, ama llumpayta ruwaychu.
He spoke quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan rimarqan.
It’s not the worst.	Manam aswan mana allinchu.
Now you’re here.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkanki.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He has to do things right.	Payqa imakunatapas allintan ruwanan.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqa.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
Okay, so there is that.	Allinmi, chaymi chay kachkan.

Lots of new stuff, learning every day.	Achka musuq imakuna, sapa punchaw yachay.
We’re happy to be around.	Kusisqam kachkaniku.
What a wonderful experience.	Ima sumaqmi chayna tarikurqa.
Everyone is terrified.	Lliwmi mancharisqa kachkanku.
I don't believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creenichu.
Eventually, he did.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
It’s not worth it.	Manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I agree with that.	Chaynatam acuerdopi kani.
That’s all.	Chayllam.
This is a very sad day.	Kay punchawqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
That’s what he wanted.	Chaytan payqa munarqan.
The better the better.	Aswan allinqa aswan allinmi.
He isn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
This was a long time ago.	Kayqa unayñam karqa.
I know it is important.	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He was never here.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypichu karqan.
It was as big as me.	Chayqa ñuqa hina hatunmi karqa.
Like the right thing to do.	Allin kaq hina.
But he is afraid.	Ichaqa manchakunmi.
It was a tough day.	Chayqa sinchi sasa p’unchaymi karqan.
I don’t like to be surprised.	Manam gustanchu admirasqa kayqa.
He’s where he needed to be.	Payqa maypichus kanan karqan chaypi.
It did really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwarqa.
I have a sense of humor.	Yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Mana allinchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
Actually, that wasn't difficult.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa manam sasachu karqa.
I think that’s the most important thing.	Chayqa aswan importante kasqanmantan yuyaykuni.
He knew about her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta.
Quick and again.	Utqaylla hinaspa yapamanta.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
He didn’t do much of anything.	Payqa manan anchatachu imatapas ruwarqan.
That wouldn’t be a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu kanman.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But he knows he can’t.	Ichaqa yachanmi mana atisqanmanta.
No one has ever done that for you.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa qanpaq ruwarqanchu.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He’s just like you.	Payqa qan hinan.
I couldn’t eat it.	Manam mikuyta atirqanichu.
I wanted to deal with this as a person.	Kaytaqa runa hinam atipayta munarqani.
I can't get it right.	Manam allintachu hapiyta atiyman.
I mean a lot of things.	Anchatam niyta munani.
Today was much better.	Kunan punchawqa aswan allinmi karqa.
It’s pretty nice, actually.	Allin sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
That statement was very good.	Chay nisqa rimayqa ancha allinmi karqan.
But, it’s okay.	Ichaqa, allinmi.
Most people agreed.	Yaqa llapan runakunam chayta acuerdopi karqaku.
I didn't want to get it that tight.	Manam chayna allintachu hapiyta munarqani.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu.
It looks beautiful.	Sumaq rikchakun.
Nothing was good about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Actually he couldn’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam atirqachu.
Now, here it was again.	Kunanqa, kaypi yapamanta kasqa.
He’ll do it.	Paymi ruwanqa.
I was just there recently.	Chayllaraqmi chaypi karqani.
He wanted it the way he wanted it.	Munasqanman hinam munarqa.
But they were like that.	Ichaqa chayna karqaku.
I wasn’t there.	Manam chaypichu karqani.
I know he is.	Yachanim pay kasqanmanta.
But no one wanted to see it.	Ichaqa manan pipas rikuyta munarqanchu.
I can't believe that now.	Chaytaqa kunanqa manam creeyta atinichu.
I have done this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytam ruwarqani.
However, it is there.	Ichaqa, chaypim kachkan.
He acted foolishly.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam ruwarqa.
He said it right.	Allintam nirqa.
This is what will happen now.	Kaymi kunan kanqa.
So something is wrong.	Chaymi imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
That’s for sure.	Chayqa seguro kasqanmanta.
I know how to listen.	Yachanim uyariyta.
I can't speak now.	Kunanqa manam rimayta atinichu.
He couldn’t tell.	Payqa manam yachayta atirqachu.
It could have been lower, it could have been lower.	Aswan pisi kanman karqan, aswan pisi kanman karqan.
He was a very big guy.	Payqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
And so it would be.	Hinaspa chayna kanman.
But no I don’t know what I am.	Ichaqa manan manan yachanichu imachus kasqayta.
He never did this before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I can’t leave him.	Manam paytaqa saqiyta atiymanchu.
That was a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
It’s not that bad.	Mana chayna mana allinchu.
That’s one of the nice things about it.	Chayqa huknin sumaqmi chaymanta.
Now he couldn't walk.	Kunanqa manañam puriyta atirqachu.
It looks crazy.	Loco hinam rikchakun.
And before that, another.	Hinaspa manaraq chaymanta, huk.
I’m glad he did something at home.	Kusikuni wasinpi imatapas ruwasqanmanta.
To do that, you’re right.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq.
You know, always.	Yachanki, sapa kuti.
But! 	Ichaqa!
I wasn’t happy at all.	Manam imapipas kusisqachu karqani.
But you don’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwanki.
You’re a young man.	Wayna runam kanki.
I haven’t seen him in thirty years.	Kimsa chunka watañam mana payta rikurqanichu.
That was my thing.	Chayqa ñuqapa kaqmi karqa.
Maybe they know where he went.	Ichapas yachanku mayman risqanmanta.
He wanted to be that guy.	Payqa chay wayna kaytan munarqan.
That’s the first thing.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
There were always a lot of people there.	Sapa kutim achka runakuna chaypi karqaku.
Do it in a different way.	Huk hinata ruway.
He couldn't work.	Payqa manam llamkayta atirqachu.
He doesn’t want to go.	Payqa manam riyta munanchu.
But there was no being with him.	Ichaqa manan karqanchu paywan kayqa.
I was really excited to do it.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani chayta ruwanaypaq.
I thought this was a good thing.	Kayqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I couldn’t let him go.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu ripunanpaq.
It was bigger than him, after all.	Paymanta aswan hatunmi karqan, tukuy imamanta.
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
She looked happy.	Payqa kusisqa qhawarisqa.
No one, ever.	Mana pipas, haykapipas.
I’m tired tonight and want to sleep.	Kunan tuta sayk’usqa kachkani, puñuyta munani.
The very best of the best.	Ancha allin kaq.

That never happened.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
There really had to be something there.	Chiqamanta chaypi imapas kanan karqa.
You don’t have a sense of humor.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
He was nowhere to be found.	Payqa manam maypipas karqachu.
You are a smart girl.	Yachaysapa sipasmi kanki.

Go to the house.	Wasiman riy.
He was busy.	Payqa ocupasqa kasharqan.
Obviously that won’t happen.	Sut’inmi mana chayqa kanqachu.
He realized that.	Chaytaqa repararqanmi.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
I'm doing it right.	Allintam ruwani.
So you can do this.	Chaymi kayta ruwawaq.
A young couple.	Huk wayna casarasqa.
She was glad he didn’t.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
No, it wasn’t anyone.	Manan, pipas karqan.
It’s probably pretty good.	Yaqapaschá ancha allin.
That was a very impressive experience.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
She says no one likes her.	Payqa ninmi mana pipas gustasqanmanta.
That’s the reality.	Chayqa cheqaq kaqmi.
You can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atiwaqchu.
Otherwise it will fail.	Mana chayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
Later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepamanmi.
You’re not there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu kanki.
You can’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.
It’s been two days.	Iskay punchawmi.

No, nothing tonight.	Manan, kunan tutaqa manan imapas.
I didn’t think about anything.	Manam imapipas piensarqanichu.

That’s what we need to do.	Chaynatam ruwananchik.

Nothing is right or wrong.	Manan imapas allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
What a good guy.	Ima allin wayna.
They want to succeed like who they are.	Paykunaqa pikuna hinam allinta ruwayta munanku.
He was hungry.	Yarqaymanta kasqa.
Therefore, it is wrong.	Chayraykum pantasqa kachkan.
He wasn't there the day before.	Ñawpaq punchawqa manam chaypichu karqa.
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
That’s a very difficult thing.	Chayqa ancha sasam.
I almost certainly did.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani.
About a year passed.	Yaqa huk wata pasarqa.
But it didn’t go well.	Ichaqa mana allintachu rirqan.
I wanted to get out of there.	Chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqani.
It’s just not safe.	Chaylla mana segurochu.
It’s really good.	Chiqamanta allinmi.
That sounds great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
So he had to go to the city every day.	Chaymi sapa punchaw chay llaqtaman rinan karqa.
What was his name?	Imataq sutin karqa.
It was a very beautiful day.	Ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.
That’s what you’re going to do.	Chaytan ruwanki.

Doing well in school seems easy.	Escuelapi allinta ruwayqa facilmi rikchakun.
Learn about it.	Chaymanta yachay.
It's clear that something needs to be done about it.	Sut'inmi kachkan chaymanta imapas ruwana kasqanmanta.

It’s nice like this.	Kay hinaqa sumaqmi.

So far it has been fine.	Kunankamaqa allinmi karqa.
He really isn’t sure he can do this.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana segurochu kashan kayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
That was never true.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
Maybe it was good.	Ichapas allin karqa.
But he never did anything.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas ruwarqanchu.

So be smart.	Chaymi yachaysapa kay.

Obviously, he didn’t.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It’s okay if you don’t want to talk.	Mana rimayta munaspaqa allinmi.

You’re a very good guy.	Ancha allinmi kanki.

He seemed sad, almost sad.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa, yaqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
Ten years ago it was easy to do.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa facilmi karqa chayta ruwayqa.

And that’s it now.	Hinaspa chaymi kunanqa.
That wasn’t exactly a good thing.	Chayqa manan allintachu allin karqan.
I just wanted to leave immediately.	Chayllam chaylla lluqsiyta munarqani.
That doesn't mean that.	Chayqa manam chayna niyta munanchu.
It’s stupid.	Sonso kaymi.
He’s very unreasonable.	Payqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
So that was rather interesting.	Chaymi chayqa aswan sumaq karqa.
It didn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
I am, you know.	Ñuqaqa kani, yachanki.
I almost did it.	Yaqapaschá ruwarqani.
She looks very nice to him.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun paypaq.
Do whatever you can.	Imapas atisqaykita ruway.
Every person every day.	Sapa runa sapa punchaw.
You need to do this quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
That’s what we had to do.	Chaynatam ruwanayku karqa.
I feel really bad.	Chiqamanta mana allintachu sientekuni.
He didn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He continued to do so.	Hinallam ruwarqa.
What would be wrong with it.	Imataq mana allin kanman.
Very happy with that.	Ancha kusisqa chaywan.
No one has anything.	Manan pipas imapas kanchu.
Actually say or say.	Chiqaptaqa niy utaq niy.
In the school.	Yachay wasipi.
He thought that would be wrong.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruwayqa mana allinchu kananta.
Of course, he didn’t.	Arí, payqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
I thought about it for a few days.	Chaypin iskay kinsa p’unchay yuyaykurqani.
So it wouldn’t be that bad.	Chaymi mana chayna mana allinchu kanman.
I enjoy everything.	Tukuy imamanta kusikuni.
You can’t get any bigger than this.	Manan kaymanta aswan hatun kayta atiwaqchu.
This was a very nice tea.	Kayqa ancha sumaq chay karqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
All the time.	Tukuy pacha.
He really knew the game.	Payqa chiqaptam chay pukllayta yacharqa.
Like today.	Kunan punchaw hina.
Nothing makes any sense.	Manan imapas imapaqpas valenchu.
You weren’t here.	Manam kaypichu karqanki.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
This is going to be huge.	Kayqa hatunmi kanqa.
Don't be so stupid.	Ama chayna sonso kaychu.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
Not too difficult though.	Mana ancha sasachu ichaqa.
Obviously probably not.	Sut’inmi manapaschá.
That’s why we’re here.	Chayraykum kaypi kachkaniku.
But it’s quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan.
Cold.	Chiri.
This young patient is critically ill.	Kay wayna unqusqa sinchi unqusqa kachkan.
Probably never, actually.	Yaqapaschá mana haykapipas, chiqaptaqa.
Most of the action will be there.	Yaqa llapan ruwaymi chaypi kanqa.
I had never done anything before.	Manam haykapipas ñawpaqtaqa imatapas ruwarqanichu.
I would do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayman.
There is no such thing.	Manan chay hinaqa kanchu.
I drove home.	Wasiyman carropi rirqani.
So he did that.	Chaymi chayta ruwarqa.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki.
They were very angry.	Paykunaqa ancha phiñasqa karqanku.
That wouldn’t have been easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
He was in the morning.	Payqa paqarinmi karqa.
He doesn’t want to be like the other adults.	Payqa manan munanchu wakin kuraq runakuna hina kayta.
And that’s all it should be.	Hinaspa chaylla kanan.
Tonight is fine.	Kunan tutaqa allinmi kachkan.
He seemed very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
I'm asking.	Tapukuni.
Instead, there is.	Aswanpas kanmi.
I never wanted to, you know.	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu, yachanki.
It turned out well.	Allinmi lluqsirqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
So we can never know.	Chaymi mana haykapipas yachayta atichwanchu.
No.	Manam.
He’s the one.	Paymi kanan.
He was angry that I did that.	Chayta ruwasqaymanta phiñasqa kachkarqa.
Every single one.	Sapa sapallan.
He was really a teacher.	Chiqaptam yachachiq karqa.
He knows what he can do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruway atisqanmanta.
But it needs something.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa imatapas necesitan.
It really didn't make any sense.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
And then,	Hinaspa chaymanta,
He said it quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan nisqa.
That's good about it.	Allinmi chaymantaqa.
Adults, not so much.	Kuraq runakuna, mana anchatachu.
A couple of years.	Iskay kimsa wata.
And the next, and the next.	Hinaspa qatiqnin, hinaspa qatiqnin.
The happy thing.	Kusisqa kaq.
It was obvious why.	Sut’inmi karqan imarayku.
I know what that is like.	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta.
We have to do things right.	Imatapas allintam ruwananchik.
That was not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
That has happened before.	Chayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
Then again, maybe he is.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas payqa kanman.
That was his first thought.	Chaytan ñawpaqta yuyaykurqan.
But really, there's nothing wrong with it.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam imapas mana allinchu.
I didn’t know what to do out there.	Manam yacharqanichu chay hawapi imata ruwanayta.
I’m still doing it.	Hinallam chayta ruwachkani.
That’s what I said.	Chaynatam nirqani.
I think it should be you.	Yuyaykuni qam kanan tiyan.
Indeed, in many cases.	Cheqaqtapunin askha kutipi chhayna.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan kasharqan.
Like, very good people.	Imayna, ancha allin runakuna.
Again, that’s all.	Yapamanta, chaylla.
No, nothing like that.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinachu.
Be okay with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi kay.
He really wanted to be admired.	Payqa anchatan admirasqa kayta munarqan.
He didn’t think so, and he got hurt.	Payqa manan chayta yuyaykurqanchu, chaymi k’irisqa karqan.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
It’s a very big deal.	Ancha hatun ruwaymi.
What is this? 	¿Imataq kay?
There was nothing.	Manam imapas karqachu.
That happened today.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi pasarqa.
He said it was very important.	Paymi nirqa ancha importante kasqanmanta.
And that’s a big deal.	Hinaspa chayqa hatun ruwaymi.
I want to go.	Riyta munani.
He, however, is wrong.	Paymi ichaqa pantasqa.
It’s been like this all summer.	Tukuy verano chhayna kasqa.
He had just driven away.	Chayraqmi payqa carropi ripurqan.
He didn’t need to.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu.
But about this.	Ichaqa kaymanta.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kachkan.
They weren’t there.	Manam chaypichu karqaku.
You were really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqanki.
if there is one.	sichus kan chayqa.
Overstating the positive can be a bad thing.	Allin kaqta llumpay rimayqa mana allinmi kanman.
And he got tired of it.	Hinaspa chaymanta sayk’usqa.
But he had to do it.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanan karqan.
It’s not that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu.
He was right, you know.	Payqa allintam nirqa, yachanki.
Every crazy person is crazy.	Llapa loco runam loco.
And there he was.	Hinaspa chaypi kasqa.
This was almost always the case.	Chayqa yaqa sapa kutim karqa.
Maybe a week late.	Ichapas huk semana tardeta.
That would do it for me.	Chayqa ñuqapaq ruwanman.
Tonight, it was a wonderful night to say the least.	Kunan tuta, ancha sumaq tuta karqan niyta.
There was nothing there.	Chaypiqa manam imapas karqachu.
He’s a three-player.	Payqa kimsa pukllaqmi.
It was a good thing that he did.	Allinmi karqa chayta ruwasqanqa.
I couldn’t ask him anything.	Manam imatapas tapuyta atirqanichu.
There will be a lot of people.	Ancha achka runakunam kanqa.
That’s what someone else had to do.	Chaynatam huk runa ruwanan karqa.
I’m afraid to go out.	Manchakuni lluqsiyta.
But he’s the one.	Ichaqa payqa.
I’m the same.	Ñuqapas kani.
But, this is what it does.	Ichaqa, kaymi ruwan.
What was more than that, they had no idea.	Imataq chaymanta aswan kasqa, mana yuyayniyuqchu karqanku.
I can’t do anything about it.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu.
It was really quick and easy.	Chiqaptam utqaylla hinaspa mana sasachu karqa.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
That doesn’t mean that.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu.
It doesn’t matter who said it.	Manan imananpaschu pichus chayta nisqanqa.
And that was it.	Hinaspa chaymi karqan.
You will never be there again.	Manañam haykapipas chaypichu kanki.
I don’t need anyone.	Manam pitapas necesitasaqchu.
He refused to help her.	Payqa manan yanapayta munarqanchu.
I'm sure it will be.	Seguro kani kanqa.
But you do it.	Ichaqa qanmi ruwanki.
He wants to remember a lot.	Achkatam yuyariyta munan.
Could this be the problem.	¿Kaychu kanman chay sasachakuy.
It’s been around for a very long time.	Ancha unayñam kachkan.
But to do that, he has to do it right.	Ichaqa chayta ruwananpaqqa allintan ruwanan.
Nothing is in a hurry.	Manan imapas usqhayllachu.
Maybe he should have done it.	Ichapas payqa ruwanan karqa.
That’s how I feel.	Chaynatam sientekuni.
I didn’t know you were here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqaykita.
It was very difficult to be here.	Ancha sasam karqa kaypi kayqa.
It was very fast.	Ancha utqayllam karqa.
They want to hear it again.	Chayta yapamanta uyariyta munanku.
This was a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
They were like difficult, tough people.	Paykunaqa sasa, sinchi runakuna hinam karqaku.
I was really proud of that.	Chaywanmi cheqaqtapuni orgulloso karqani.
Everyone wants to play.	Tukuy runa pukllayta munan.
If it was him.	Sichus pay karqan chayqa.
He was as innocent as a child.	Payqa wawa hinam mana huchayoq karqa.
He seems to be fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun.
I was glad he was there.	Chaypi pay kasqanmanta kusisqa tarikurqani.
But he could not stay in the house.	Ichaqa manan chay wasipi qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
This approach is good on its own.	Kay ruwayqa sapallanmi allin.
Make a game of it.	Huk pukllayta ruway.
You think you can do anything!.	¡Imatapas ruwayta atisqaykita yuyanki!.
How long will this last?	¿Hayk’a tiempon kayqa kanqa?
They were really great.	Paykunaqa chiqap hatunmi karqaku.
You’ll find out soon enough.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan yachanki.
He never knew.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu.
You have to do the same thing.	Qampas chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
That sounds good.	Chayqa allinmi uyarikun.
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
It actually turned out really nice.	Chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi lluqsirqa.
It must be bad for me to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa mana allinmi kanan.
He was very curious about everything.	Payqa anchatam munarqa tukuy imata yachayta.
Yes, he is fine.	Arí, payqa allinmi kachkan.
Now for a while.	Kunanqa huk tiempo.
He wasn’t like her.	Manam pay hinachu karqa.
This is what it’s called.	Kaymi nisqa.
So, however, it probably won’t happen.	Chaymi ichaqa manapaschá kanqachu.
That he can handle it.	Chayta aguantayta atisqanmanta.
But he couldn't be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
So that’s it.	Chaymi chay.
He's happy, he says.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan, nispas nin.
But what will it be like?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynataq kanqa?.
But they weren’t always like that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqanku.
I really don't know why.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
You just did it right now.	Chayllaraqmi ruwarqanki.
Like anyone else.	Pipas hina.
They’re both tired.	Iskayninkum sayk’usqa kachkanku.
I don't really mean it.	Mana chiqaptachu niyta munani.
He had to be quick.	Payqa utqayllam kanan karqa.
That time.	Chay pacha.
Here it is, right here.	Kaypim kachkan.
So, however, it is not true.	Chaymi ichaqa mana cheqaqchu.
Here he is right.	Kaypiqa payqa allintam rimachkan.
Somewhere he never was.	Maypipas mana hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
Something else went wrong.	Huk imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
Better late than never!	¡Aswan allinmi tardeta mana hayk’aqpas!
You're pretty crazy, aren't you?	Qamqa allintam loco kanki, ¿aw?
I just didn’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta.
I’m here tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kaypi kachkani.
This can be the greatest success.	Kaymi aswan hatun allin ruwayqa kanman.
Something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin.
He likes it a lot.	Payqa anchatam gustan.
Don’t do anything else.	Mana ima ruwaytapas ruwaychu.
But if .	Ichaqa sichus.
Who will do it first?.	¿Pitaq ñawpaqta ruwanqa?.
I made it happen.	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwarqani.
But no one could do better.	Ichaqa manan pipas aswan allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
This was a great time.	Kaymi hatun pacha karqa.
That was a remarkable experience.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I haven’t done that, well, ever.	Manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu, allinmi, haykapipas.
I did the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwarqani.
He declined to say why.	Payqa manan munarqanchu imarayku chayta niyta.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I think you should.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanaykipaq.
Maybe he should go.	Ichapas rinan.
They want to talk to me for some reason.	Imaraykupas ñuqawan rimayta munanku.
I don’t want to live in this city.	Manam kay llaqtapi tiyayta munanichu.
That’s why he wants to come here.	Chayraykum kayman hamuyta munan.
But most people.	Ichaqa yaqa llapan runakuna.
But it’s a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwana.
It is better to be on time.	Aswan allinmi kanman tiempollanpi kayqa.
Very important person.	Ancha importante runa.
It’s no longer worth it.	Manaña imapaqpas valenchu.
And if you don’t.	Hinaspa mana chayta ruwanki chayqa.
I knew you did something else.	Yacharqanim hukta ruwasqaykita.
He couldn't think of anything.	Payqa manam imatapas yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
But it’s not the only thing.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu.
I had to do it right.	Allintam ruwanay karqa.
That’s something I don’t know for sure.	Chayqa manan allintachu yachani.
And he spoke.	Hinaspa rimarqan.
That’s how we are.	Chayna kanchik.
It’s very, very difficult.	Ancha, ancha sasam.
However, this statement is incorrect.	Ichaqa, kay nisqanqa manan allinchu.
There are some great people there.	Chaypiqa kanmi wakin hatun runakuna.
So, it was a little cold.	Chaymi, huk chikan chiri kasqa.
Not an easy task.	Mana facil ruwaychu.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
But he knows it.	Ichaqa yachanmi.
That’s what he said.	Chaynatam nirqa.
It’s going to be great.	Hatunmi kanqa.
I’m doing it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruwachkani.
Scholars disagree.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa manam chaymantaqa acuerdopichu kanku.
Me and me and me and me.	Ñuqapas ñuqapas ñuqapas ñuqapas.
Very big for me.	Ancha hatun ñuqapaq.
He never did that before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He took it out.	Chaytaqa hurqurqa.
But now, there is nothing.	Ichaqa kunanqa, manan imapas kanchu.
But you can’t wait on him.	Ichaqa manan paytaqa suyayta atiwaqchu.
If that’s what you want.	Sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
They were wicked men.	Chay runakunaqa millay runakunam karqaku.
So young man.	Chaymi wayna.
I was, too, at the time.	Ñuqapas karqani, chay pacha.
That’s so fucking beautiful.	Chayqa ancha millay sumaqmi.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It will always be there.	Sapa kutim kanqa.
Or the food.	Utaq mikhuy.
I'd rather not linger here.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaypi mana unaytachu.
But they are there.	Ichaqa chaypim kachkanku.
No, you really should.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanayki.
But no one knows how many there are.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I have never seen anything like it.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa rikurqanichu.
So you never know.	Chaymi mana haykapipas yachankichu.
I had no one to go to.	Manam pipas rinaypaq karqachu.
I’m good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kani.
I can't really be with him and do a lot of things.	Manam chiqaptachu paywan kayta hinaspa achka ruwaykunata ruwayta atiyman.
I couldn't figure out what was going on.	Manam atirqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta.
He wants to be here.	Payqa kaypi kaytam munan.
But you don’t really know how to do that.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachanki imaynatas chayta ruwawaq chayta.
That, however, he did not do.	Chaytan ichaqa mana ruwarqanchu.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
He started to fall asleep.	Puñuyta qallaykurqa.
That's not such a bad thing.	Chayqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
I never want to see that again.	Chaytaqa manañam haykapipas qawayta munanichu.
One of those a year ago.	Huknin chaymanta wata ñawpaqta.
Why does he look so sad?	¿Imanasqataq chayna llakisqa rikchakun?
He knew what was out there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay hawapi imakuna kashasqanmanta.
And then another.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk.
He's badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k'irisqa kashan.
It’s not that hard to do.	Manam chayna sasachu ruwayqa.
This is the one.	Kaymi chay.
They were really up front with me.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam ñuqawan ñawpaqpi karqaku.
Everything is excellent.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi.
But he won’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwanqachu.
Can’t see anything but money.	Mana imatapas rikuyta atinchu aswanpas qullqita.
Do your best to do it.	Tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
I don't know where one went.	Manam yachanichu mayman huknin risqanmanta.
And why not.	Hinaspa imaraykutaq mana.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I've never done that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
But he was ultimately lucky.	Ichaqa qhepa suerteyoqmi karqan.
He is always talking.	Payqa sapa kutim rimachkan.
It doesn’t matter that.	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu.
Again, not happy about it though.	Yapamanta, mana kusisqachu chaymanta ichaqa.
She would rather be alone than unhappy.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman sapallan kay mana kusisqa kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to have sex with you.	Manam munanichu qamwan puñuyta.
This is him, guys.	Kayqa paymi.
They certainly were.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin karqanku.
And we would talk.	Hinaspa rimaq kayku.
The first one is difficult.	Ñawpaq kaqmi sasa.
He was the best in everything.	Paymi tukuy imapipas aswan allinqa karqan.
This isn't great, but it's better.	Kayqa manam ancha allinchu, ichaqa aswan allinmi.
I thought it would be safer outside at night.	Tuta hawapi aswan seguro kananta yuyaykurqani.
This is not true.	Kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
She wants nothing to do with him.	Payqa manan munanchu paywan ima ruwaytapas.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
The first and only.	Ñawpaq kaq hinaspa sapallan.
It won’t be a good one.	Manam allinchu kanqa.
All night, really.	Tukuy tuta, chiqap.
So it’s just in time.	Chaymi tiempollanpi.
I hear it every day.	Sapa punchawmi uyarini.
We did well after that.	Chay qhepamanmi allinta ruwarqayku.
That’s a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi.
It doesn’t do anything for you.	Manan imatapas qanpaq ruwanchu.
We’ve done it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqayku.
I feel fast.	Utqayllam sientekuni.
He is a double-edged sword.	Payqa iskay runam.
Surprisingly it came out not bad.	Admirakuypaqmi lluqsirqa mana mana allinchu.
Now we need to get most things right.	Kunanqa yaqa llapan imakunatapas allintam ruwananchik.
But there’s no way to actually do that.	Ichaqa manan kanchu imayna cheqaqtapuni chayta ruwanapaq.
But this makes no sense.	Ichaqa kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
This is easy.	Kayqa facilmi.
That is the best way to do it.	Chayqa aswan allin ruwaymi.
It can have a negative impact on performance.	Ruwaypi mana allintachu ruwanman.
But it wasn’t just that.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu karqan.
I can hear him now.	Kunanmi paytaqa uyarini.
I thought it had to be here.	Yuyarqanim kaypi kanan kasqanmanta.
Like a child.	Wawa hina.
As before, as before.	Ñawpaq hina.
It was a bad thing.	Mana allin kaqmi karqa.
That would do the trick.	Chayqa allintam ruwanman.
He says he’s going to do it.	Ruwananpaqmi nin.
I don’t know what’s good.	Manam yachanichu ima allin kasqanmanta.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
This is going to be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanqa.
You just said it.	Chayllaraqmi nirqanki.
He will surely come.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin hamunqa.
And he was with her.	Hinan payqa paywan kasharqan.
But he didn’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
It’s bigger, you know.	Aswan hatunmi, yachanki.
I just can’t stand it.	Chaylla mana aguantayta atinichu.
Almost anyone out there.	Yaqa pipas hawapi.
So he does it.	Chaymi payqa ruwan.
Evil is dismissed as something real.	Mana allinqa imapas chiqap kaqta hinam qarqusqa kachkan.
Yeah, maybe that one.	Arí, ichapas chay huknin.
Tom told me to tell him.	Tommi niwarqa payta willanaypaq.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Iskayrayani, ichaqa ichapas.
And then he does it.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ruwan.
Everyone was like that.	Tukuy runa imayna kasqa.
You just can't say anything, you know?	Qamqa manam imatapas niyta atiwaqchu, ¿yachankichu?
He knew he was there though.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta ichaqa.
I want to win today.	Kunan punchawmi atipayta munani.
The scientists were amazing.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
One of them is not very good.	Hukninmi mana ancha allinchu.
He did it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chaytaqa ruwaq.
I will be as usual, please.	Ñuqaqa sapa kuti hinam kanqa, ama hina kaspa.
Now was the time.	Kunanmi chay tiempo karqan.
He is a handsome man.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runam.
It was like day and night.	Tuta punchaw hinam karqa.
He did everything he could to make sure everything worked out.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinan ruwarqan tukuy imapas allin kananpaq.
So tired of it.	Chaymi sayk'usqa.
I’m sorry about that.	Chaymantam llakikuni.
He barely spoke.	Payqa yaqapaschá rimaq.
Probably never.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas.
That wouldn’t be true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman.
But tell me about yourself.	Ichaqa qanmanta willaway.
Something would be good, he said.	Imapas allinmi kanman, nispa.
He couldn't hear them now.	Chaykunataqa manam kunanqa uyariyta atirqachu.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu.
It’s gone, it’s gone.	Manañan kanchu, manañan kanchu.
These won’t last long!.	¡Kaykunaqa manam unaytachu kanqa!.
I want this one.	Kayta munani.
It was taken very quickly, and very quickly.	Ancha utqaylla hapisqa, hinaspa ancha utqaylla.
Do it right, that’s what it is.	Allinta ruway, chaymi kan.
But this isn’t how it works.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu llank’ashan.
I mean, it was crazy.	Niyta munani, loco hinam karqa.
It was a great day.	Hatun punchawmi karqa.
I wanted to ask about that.	Chaymantam tapuyta munarqani.
We hadn’t talked about it before.	Manaraq chaymanta rimaq kayku.
I don’t want that.	Chaytaqa manam munanichu.
This may be useful for you.	Kayqa ichapas qampaq allin kanman.
So that’s not a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa mana allinchu.
They have a good sense of what the weather is like here.	Paykunaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku kaypi pacha imayna kasqanmanta.
I just don’t know what to do first.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imatachus ñawpaqta ruwanayta.
I can’t stand it anymore.	Manañam aguantayta atinichu.
This was now.	Kayqa kunanmi karqan.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
It's very cold.	Sinchi chiri.
Two reasons for, you know, what happened.	Iskay imarayku, yachanki, imachus pasasqanmanta.
But, so far, everything seemed pretty innocent.	Ichaqa, kunankamaqa, tukuy imapas allin mana huchayoq hinam karqa.
He didn't want her to do that.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chayta ruwananta.
First there were people.	Ñawpaqtaqa runakunam karqaku.
First of all, it doesn’t exist.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan kanchu.
I don’t know when.	Manam yachanichu haykapi.
It was very difficult.	Ancha sasam karqa.
I’m really looking forward to it.	Chiqamanta suyachkani chayta.
But this is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kayqa.
He looked familiar.	Payqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
I was there one night.	Huk tutam chaypi karqani.
Okay, here it is.	Allinmi, kaypim kachkan.
Despite the difficulty.	Sasachakuy kaptinpas.
Maybe that’s what it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan hina kanman.
That was supposed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan karqa.
Now, go do it.	Kunanqa, riy ruway.
That meant a lot to me.	Chayqa anchatam ñuqapaq karqa.
That’s a quick one.	Chayqa utqayllam.
I didn’t know what happened.	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasasqanmanta.
Anyway, he's not like the kid there.	Imayna kaptinpas, payqa manam chaypi kaq wawa hinachu.
This is the worst part.	Kaymi aswan mana allinqa.
We should do this every morning!.	¡Sapa paqarinmi kayta ruwananchik!.
He can’t stay there.	Payqa manan chaypi qhepakuyta atinchu.
No one has ever done that before.	Manan pipas chaytaqa hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He thought about it.	Chaypin yuyaykurqan.
Of course, we did.	Chiqamanta, chayta ruwarqayku.
You can never win.	Manan hayk’aqpas atipayta atiwaqchu.
That's the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allin kaqmi.
I need to be clearer.	Aswan sut’inmi kanay.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananta.
I am not sure about this.	Kaymantaqa manam allintachu yachani.
He doesn't seem right.	Payqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
I wanted the future.	Hamuq tiempotan munarqani.
So good for you!!.	Chaymi allin qampaq!!.
First, a .	Ñawpaqtaqa, huk .
He was just around the corner.	Payqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
It’s too sad to be true.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi chiqap kasqanmanta.
But everything will be fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I want that too.	Ñuqapas chaytaqa munani.
He knew there was one.	Yacharqa huk kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to be yours.	Manam qampaq kayta munarqanichu.
He’ll be here at the end of the week.	Payqa kaypi kanqa semana tukukuypi.
It was a very sad experience.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Like right now, here with you.	Kunan hina, kaypi qanwan kuska.
If you really want it, you will.	Sichus cheqaqtapuni munanki chayqa, chaytan ruwanki.
So, he’s right.	Chaymi, payqa allintam nin.
And so it is.	Hinaspa chaynata.
He noticed how I was doing.	Payqa repararqanmi imayna ruwasqayta.
The last statement is obvious.	Qhepa kaq rimayqa sut’inmi.
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
Looked at it better.	Aswan allinta qhawarisqa.
That’s not a bad thing to do.	Chayqa manan mana allin ruwaychu.
But never like this.	Ichaqa ama hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa.
Now he knew better.	Kunanqa aswan allintan yacharqan.
But one truth seems to stand out above all else.	Ichaqa huk cheqaq kaqmi tukuy imamantapas allinpaq qhawarisqa hina.
Fast and safe, that's the way to do it.	Utqaylla hinaspa seguro, chaymi chayna ruwanapaq.
I was not happy about this.	Kaymantaqa manam kusisqachu karqani.
Something told me he was there.	Imapas niwarqa chaypi kasqanmanta.
He had to continue.	Payqa hinallam kanan karqa.
It happened all the time.	Chayna kaptinqa sapa kutim pasarqa.
This event was the first of its kind.	Kay ruwayqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
But that’s it.	Ichaqa chaymi.
But that was not the case before that time.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan chay tiempo ñawpaqtaqa.
Again, a delicious treat!	Yapamanta, huk sumaq mikhuy!
Tell me how you are doing.	Willaway imayna kasqaykita.
I’m sorry about this.	Kaymanta llakikuni.
I don't know what's wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
Something to do.	Imatapas ruwana.
That’s not what he does.	Chaytaqa manam payqa ruwanchu.
I can never leave it at that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa saqiyta atiymanchu.
I wasn’t sure who to talk to first.	Manam allintachu yacharqani piwan puntata rimanaypaq.
I don’t feel very comfortable.	Manam ancha allinchu tarikuni.
It went really well.	Chiqamanta allinta rirqa.
Something very useful to do.	Imapas ancha allin ruwanapaq.
He wished it wasn't so late.	Payqa munarqanmi mana chay hina tarde kananta.
Great great great.	Hatun hatun hatun.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.
That would have been the only thing.	Chayllam kanman karqa.
You seemed happy.	Kusisqa hinam karqanki.
That was the morning.	Chayqa paqarinmi karqa.
I would like to know if that is the case or not.	Munaymanmi yachayta sichus chayna kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta.
Everyone knows that, but it would be good.	Chaytaqa llapallankum yachanku, ichaqa allinmi kanman.
And this was a daily routine.	Hinaspa kayqa sapa punchaw ruwaymi karqa.
A little sad, he went on.	Huk chhikanta llakisqa, nispas rirqa.
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
No, no, no, no.	Mana, mana, mana.
Unfortunately, that is the case.	Llakikuypaqmi chayna kasqanmantaqa.
It should get the job done.	Chayqa chay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi kanan.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
I’m going to go now.	Kunanqa risaq.
That will have to happen soon after that.	Chayqa chaymantaqa chayllaraqmi kanan kanqa.
Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
It would have been there.	Chaypin kanman karqan.
I am the only one who can do that.	Ñuqallam chaytaqa ruwayman.
I had to hurry up.	Usqhaylla ruwanay karqan.
Do it with him.	Paywan ruway.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
That may or may not be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman, manapaschá allinchu kanman.
Otherwise, do something else.	Mana chayqa hukta ruway.
We are not that good.	Manam chayna allinchu kanchik.
What’s the possibility.	Imataq kanman.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
Everyone knows everything.	Lliwmi tukuy imatapas yachanku.
He opened the door.	Payqa punkuta kicharirqa.
If it came out.	Sichus lluqsirqa.
It’s going to be huge.	Hatun hatunmi kanqa.
But it wasn’t that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
That’s just me.	Chayqa ñuqallam.
Everyone wants to do better.	Lliwmi aswan allinta ruwayta munanku.
Thus, there exists .	Chay hinaqa, kanmi .
You really were.	Chiqaptam karqanki.
Many people were injured.	Achka runakunam k'irisqa karqaku.
That is why they are so popular.	Chayraykum paykunaqa ancha riqsisqa kanku.
Do the going.	Ruway riy.
Learn the easy way.	Facil ñanta yachay.
You were with me all day.	Tukuy punchawmi ñuqawan karqanki.
He looks so great.	Payqa ancha hatunmi rikchakun.
He was a very tough guy.	Payqa ancha sinchi runam karqa.
I know better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinta yachani.
But he knew what he could do.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi ima ruway atisqanmanta.
He did everything tough.	Payqa tukuy imatam sinchita ruwarqa.
He knows he can.	Payqa yachanmi atisqanmanta.
He knew how to make money.	Payqa qullqita ruwayta yacharqa.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I can’t wait any longer.	Manañam suyayta atiymanchu.
Or somewhere else.	Utaq maypipas.
The process is very simple.	Chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
I hope no one gets hurt.	Suyachkani mana pipas k’irisqa kananta.
I don’t think you can do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atiwaqchu, nispan yuyaykuni.
The first is location.	Ñawpaq kaqmi maypi kasqanmanta.
I can’t tell you anymore.	Manañam willayta atiymanchu.
That doesn’t matter now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
Maybe too much.	Ichapas llumpayta.
Can you do something else?	¿Atiwaqchu huk ruwayta?
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I’ll do it again.	Hukmanta ruwasaq.
Even so, it is.	Chayna kaptinpas.
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanichu.
But it is not easy to act quickly.	Ichaqa manan facilchu usqhaylla imatapas ruwayqa.
These are the best.	Kaykunaqa aswan allinqa.
I had no idea how he would do it.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna ruwananta.
It would have been nice.	Sumaqmi kanman karqa.
I couldn’t sleep.	Manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
It’s not worth it.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Everything is set up.	Tukuy imapas churasqa kachkan.
He doesn’t know anything about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas imatapas yachanchu.
That’s what we did.	Chaytan ruwarqayku.
So once again.	Chaymi huk kutipi.
The guy who did the work.	Llamk’ayta ruwaq wayna.
But it was very clear that no one would want to.	Ichaqa ancha sut’inmi karqan, manan pipas munanmanchu.
There is no other purpose for it.	Manam huk imapaqpas chaypaqqa kanchu.
But first of all.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa.
But it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqa.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Ñoqaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
Sadly, that happened.	Llakikuypaqmi chay pasarqa.
He said he felt uncomfortable.	Paymi nirqa mana allintachu sientekusqanmanta.
I’ll do something like that.	Chayna imatapas ruwasaq.
They are very large.	Paykunaqa ancha hatunmi kanku.
It’s just not a good time for me.	Chaylla mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta ñuqapaq.
I was extremely tired.	Sinchi sayk’usqañan karqani.
Not that day.	Mana chay punchawchu.
And here’s the most interesting part.	Hinaspa kaypi aswan sumaq kaq.
The people you love.	Munasqayki runakuna.
Obviously it wasn’t good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
It must be a human being.	Huk runam kanan.
But it’s the second one.	Ichaqa iskay kaqmi.
Again, thank you.	Yapamanta, gracias.
From city to city.	Llaqtamanta llaqtaman.
He knew that it would be difficult for him to do so.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruway paypaq sasa kananta.
Something will have to be done about it tomorrow.	Paqarinmi chaymantaqa imatapas ruwana kanqa.
I don't understand that.	Chaytaqa manam entiendenichu.
But he wanted to know more.	Ichaqa astawan yachayta munarqa.
I look forward to hearing!.	¡Suyachkani uyariyta!.
They were really, really difficult.	Paykunaqa chiqap, chiqap sasam karqaku.
There’s some food if you want, please.	Munaspaqa kanmi wakin mikhuy, ama hina kaspa.
I can't tell you now.	Kunanqa manam willayta atiymanchu.
That wouldn’t be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanman.
I don’t know if that’s good for you.	Mana yachanichu chay qampaq allinchu icha manachu chayta.
Who’s here to stay? 	¿Pitaq kaypi kachkan?
I didn’t agree with it.	Manam acuerdopichu karqani.
He didn’t know he would.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwananta.
I’ve never seen them so scared.	Mana hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu chay hina mancharisqa kasqankuta.
The whole house.	Tukuy wasi.
That seems to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
More than that.	Aswan chaymanta.
I can't answer those.	Chaykunataqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu.
Tell him to drive better.	Aswan allinta carrota manejananpaq niy.
I felt insecure.	Manañam segurochu tarikurqani.
There was a very good, good thing he had to do.	Huk ancha allin, allin ruwaymi karqan, chaytan ruwanan karqan.
I mean, hard.	Niyta munani, sinchi.
I didn’t notice it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa repararqanichu.
He still lives there today.	Kunankamapas chaypim tiyan.
And it’s cold.	Hinaspa chiri.
Please tell me about this.	Ama hina kaspa, kaymanta willaway.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Manam chaywanqa imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.
I don’t understand how it is.	Manam entiendenichu imayna kasqanmanta.
This here, there and there.	Kay kaypi, chaypi chaypi.
And it’s such an easy thing to do.	Hinaspa chayna facil ruway.
Something.	Imapas.
Do some thinking.	Wakin yuyaymanayta ruway.
But now he had no choice.	Ichaqa kunanqa manañan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I know this is going to be a big year for me.	Yachanim kayqa hatun wata ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
He’s not good or anything.	Payqa manan allinchu nitaq imapas.
It’s so beautiful, isn’t it?	Ancha sumaqmi, ¿aw?
Instead, I was happy.	Aswanpas kusisqan karqani.
There was one thing.	Huk kaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqanichu.
This is the big problem.	Kaymi hatun sasachakuy.
Thank you, thank you.	Gracias, gracias.
Have a nice year.	Allin wata.
It wasn’t the best.	Manam aswan allinchu karqa.
It really is him.	Chiqaptam paymi.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But they were black people.	Ichaqa yana runakunam karqaku.
He’s not good at all.	Payqa manan allinchu ni imapipas.
That was a very long time ago.	Chayqa ancha unayñam karqa.
It will be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanqa.
Another great achievement.	Huk hatun ruway.
There he is!	¡Chaypin payqa kashan!
I don’t make a lot of money.	Manam achka qullqita tarinichu.
Three years ago.	Kimsa wata ñawpaqta.
He went to the scene.	Payqa chayman rirqa.
For more information, go here.	Astawan yachayta munaspaqa kayman riy.
There is something better.	Aswan allinqa kanmi.
But it was never going to be very good.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha allinchu kanan karqan.
These men were with him.	Chay runakunam paywan karqaku.
It’s easier to do now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi ruwayqa.
That’s one of the things.	Chayqa huknin kaqmi.
That doesn't make sense.	Chay nisqanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I don’t know who these people are.	Manam yachanichu pikuna kay runakuna kasqankuta.
And very sad.	Hinaspa ancha llakisqa.
It should make sense by now.	Kunankamaqa yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
Maybe he went too fast.	Ichapas payqa llumpay utqaylla rirqa.
This was a big one.	Kayqa hatunmi karqa.
You want to share them with me.	Chaykunataqa ñuqawan willayta munanki.
So it takes time.	Chaymi tiempota necesitan.
But there isn’t much time for that.	Ichaqa manan chaypaqqa askha tiempo kanchu.
It didn’t turn out well.	Mana allintachu lluqsirqa.
He certainly does.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
That was a great experience for me.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa ñuqapaq.
As if tired,	Sayk’usqa hina, .
She could tell he was angry.	Payqa repararqanmi phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
He knew how to drive.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna manejayta.
Someone says something funny.	Pipas imapas asikunapaq hinam nin.
I think he was very scared.	Yuyaykuni ancha mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
What is real is the present.	Imachus chiqap kaqmi kunan pacha.
He wanted to do it.	Payqa ruwayta munarqa.
I knew there were a lot of fast people.	Yacharqanim achka utqaylla runakuna kasqankuta.
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá karqan.
There are a lot of people there.	Chaypim achka runakuna kachkan.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Ichapas chayna hinaspa ichapas mana.
He didn’t need one.	Payqa manan hukta necesitarqanchu.
So you said it.	Chaymi nirqanki.
Very well then, that would be it.	Ancha allinmi chaymanta, chaymi kanman.
Why should it be so?	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanan.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
There is one thing.	Huk kaqmi kachkan.
Yes, that will be better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
That’s what he didn’t do.	Chaytan payqa mana ruwarqanchu.
What a job it is.	Ima ruwaymi.
I was a smart guy.	Ñuqaqa yachaysapa runam karqani.
I wasn’t happy with that.	Chaywanqa manam kusisqachu karqani.
But obviously this was wrong.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana allinchu karqan.
But it probably isn’t.	Ichaqa manapaschá.
What’s the secret.	Imataq pakasqa.
It was cold but delicious.	Chayqa chiri ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
This, however, is difficult.	Kayqa ichaqa sasam.
But even so, there was nothing he could do.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
I thought that would be it.	Chayna kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
He's really on to something.	Payqa chiqaptam imapas ruwaypi kachkan.
What a baby, what a beautiful baby.	Ima wawa, ima sumaq wawa.
But the truth is much, much worse than that.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi aswan, aswan mana allin chaymantaqa.
You really wouldn’t want to see him.	Chiqamanta mana payta rikuyta munawaqchu.
All of this is very interesting.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ancha sumaqmi.
You just have to do it.	Chaylla ruwanayki.
About two years, one week.	Yaqa iskay wata, huk semana.
I'm sure about it.	Seguro kani chaymanta.
Now, he's finally doing something.	Kunanqa, payqa tukukuypi imatapas ruwachkan.
I’m not really worried about that.	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu llakikuni.
And everyone here agrees with that.	Hinaspa kaypi llapallanku chayta acuerdopi kanku.
He’s not here.	Payqa manan kaypichu.
They know it’s better out there.	Paykunaqa yachanku chay hawapi aswan allin kasqanmanta.
I mean, he really knows what he's doing.	Niyta munani, payqa chiqaptam yachan ima ruwasqanmanta.
He knew nothing about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanchu.
We are very proud of it.	Anchatam orgulloso kayku chaymanta.
Being too slow.	Llumpay llumpay kay.
More than once, more.	Aswan huk kuti, astawan.
But that is not the case here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kaypiqa.
He knew that.	Chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
That’s a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi.
Obviously, do what you can.	Sut’inmi, atisqaykita ruway.
I’m glad I’m here.	Kusikuni kaypi kasqaymanta.
You’ll find out later.	Qhepamanmi yachanki.
I actually saw him.	Chiqamanta payta rikurqani.
Nothing seemed very important now.	Kunanqa manan imapas ancha importante hinachu karqan.
That seemed a little too easy.	Chayqa huk chikan ancha facilmi rikchakurqa.
He is not here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
I knew it was true.	Yacharqanim chiqap kasqanmanta.
Bad weather awaits in the future.	Hamuq tiempopiqa mana allin tiempon suyashan.
We pretty much agree.	Yaqa llapanpim acuerdopi kayku.
So that was pretty cool.	Chaymi chayqa ancha sumaq karqa.
That’s not the case anymore.	Chayqa manañan kanchu.
Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
He can’t see it.	Payqa manam rikuyta atinchu.
But you don’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munankichu.
That says a lot.	Chayqa achkatam nin.
You will be immediately considered.	Chaylla qhawarisqa kanki.
It was worse.	Aswan mana allinmi karqa.
He wasn't so sure he took the next step.	Payqa mana ancha segurochu qatiqnin ruwayta ruwarqa.
This really didn’t seem to make much sense.	Kayqa chiqamanta mana ancha yuyayniyuq hinachu karqa.
He wants to live in a nice house.	Payqa sumaq wasipi tiyayta munan.
I really wanted to do it.	Chiqaptam ruwayta munarqani.
They are very happy.	Paykunaqa ancha kusisqam kachkanku.
I was there for a year.	Chaypim huk wata karqani.
A few hours ago everything was fine.	Iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
An awkward moment.	Huk mana allin rato.
He was probably as big as me.	Payqa yaqapaschá ñoqa hina hatun karqan.
It's like the only thing.	Chayqa sapallan kaq hinam.
What was it like before?	¿Imaynataq karqa ñawpaqta?
He opened the window.	Payqa ventanata kicharirqa.
A few years, maybe more.	Iskay kimsa wata, ichapas aswan achkata.
But it wouldn’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
It’s the worst.	Aswan mana allinmi.
He said there was no one in the house.	Paymi nirqa wasipi mana pipas kasqanmanta.
He could never walk again.	Manañam haykapipas puriyta atirqachu.
He is not there.	Payqa manam chaypichu kachkan.
That’s the big secret.	Chayqa hatun pakasqa.
He passed away a few years ago.	Payqa iskay kinsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi wañupurqan.
To do something is to do nothing.	Imatapas ruwayqa mana imatapas ruwaymi.
Rich, intelligent, handsome.	Qhapaq, yachaysapa, sumaq rikchayniyuq.
Again, that’s me.	Yapamanta, chaymi ñuqa kani.
Maybe he doesn’t do what you do.	Ichapas mana qam hinachu ruwan.
I will do whatever it takes to make it better.	Allin kananpaqmi imatapas ruwasaq.
And please tell me.	Hinaspa ama hina kaspa willaway.
I feel good about myself.	Allintam sientekuni.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Another person.	Huk runa.
But it doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
But never this one.	Ichaqa ama hayk’aqpas kaytaqa.
That’s right, one.	Chayqa allinmi, huk.
I would be fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kayman.
It certainly happened to me.	Cheqaqtapunin ñoqawanqa chay hina karqan.
I mean the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan niyta munani.
They were no longer there.	Manañam chaypichu karqaku.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan karqan.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
He didn't know how he felt.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna sientekusqanmanta.
There are still many.	Achka hinallam kachkan.
He did, you know.	Payqa ruwarqa, yachanki.
Everything else did.	Tukuy imapas ruwarqa.
He seemed pretty hurt.	Payqa sumaq k’irisqa hinam karqa.
It will be here.	Kaypim kanqa.
But he’s not really that busy.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna ocupasqa kashan.
And if not, you know.	Hinaspa mana chayqa yachanki.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwananmanta.
There’s something useful about it.	Chaypiqa kanmi imapaqpas allin.
He walked to school every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi yachay wasiman puriq.
A teacher asked me.	Huk yachachiqmi tapuwarqa.
But that was not the case here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan kaypiqa.
They are a reality.	Paykunaqa huk cheqaq kaqmi.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Yes he does exist.	Arí payqa kanmi.
And everything looked very, very new.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas ancha, ancha musuq rikchakurqa.
Everything was going to be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanan karqa.
But I feel great.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi sientekuni.
I want to tell you that.	Chayta willayta munani.
He does it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwan.
It's much easier now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi kachkan.
Why should I do this?	¿Imanasqataq kayta ruwanay?
He thought he was hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqanmantan yuyaykurqan.
I don't know what that was about.	Manam yachanichu imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
Now, we are more beautiful.	Kunanqa, aswan sumaqmi kanchik.
There’s nothing wrong with that at all.	Manam imapas mana allinchu chaypiqa ni imapipas.
Said it was too much.	Nisqa ancha achka kasqanmanta.
Another time.	Huk pacha.
Is it still there?	¿Hinallaraqchu kachkan?
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
And that’s it.	Hinaspa chaymi.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
That stuff is pretty cool.	Chay imapas ancha sumaqmi.
Big and strong.	Hatun hinaspa sinchi.
And then there was one after that.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk karqan chaymanta.
I don’t want to talk about how to make it better.	Manam rimayta munanichu imayna aswan allin kananpaq.
No one can do it here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas atinmanchu.
But nothing seemed to do it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chayta ruwaq hinachu karqan.
I usually do that.	Yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa ruwani.
He was the one who was fired.	Paymi qarqusqa karqa.
That makes it tough.	Chayqa sinchitan ruwan.
They were both great.	Iskayninkum hatun karqaku.
But it was kind of weird.	Ichaqa huk laya admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I'm sorry, I can't do it.	Pampachaykuway, manam ruwayta atinichu.
These are the.	Kaykunaqa.
But I would be fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kayman.
That doesn’t sound right at all.	Chayqa manan allintachu uyarikun ni imapipas.
I feel so stupid.	Ancha sonso hinam tarikuni.
Do things for him on a regular basis.	Paypaq imakunatapas sapa kutilla ruway.
There are two people here.	Kaypiqa iskay runam kachkan.
This was stupidity.	Kayqa sonso kaymi karqa.
He could have done better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwayta atinman karqan.
One is the new one.	Hukninmi musuq kaq.
It was a high school thing.	Colegiopi kaqmi karqa.
I almost heard your thoughts.	Yaqapaschá uyarirqani yuyaykusqaykita.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
And being human.	Chaymanta runa kay.
But do something about it.	Ichaqa imatapas ruway.
I'm just so tired.	Chayllaraqmi llumpayta sayk'usqa kachkani.
It’s not, however.	Manam ichaqa.
In the morning,	Tutamanta, .
Of course, he didn’t.	Arí, manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
I didn’t want to be this.	Manam kayta munarqanichu.
The weather will be good today.	Kunan punchawmi allin pacha kanqa.
art.	sumaq ruway.
This is going to be a great day.	Kayqa hatun punchawmi kanqa.
He obviously didn’t.	Sut’inmi mana chayta ruwasqanqa.
I never knew what.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imatam.
It's almost like nothing.	Yaqa mana imapas kanman hinam.
How I was supposed to do it.	Imaynatan ruwanay karqan.
He said it was all right.	Allinmi nispam nirqa.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
Ready, one, two or three.	Listo, huk, iskay kimsa.
I didn’t want that.	Chaytaqa manan munarqanichu.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
Everyone was busy, but soon someone will be with him.	Lliwmi ocupasqa karqaku, ichaqa chayllam pipas paywan kanqa.
Everything was as usual.	Tukuy imapas sapa kuti hinam karqa.
I’ve been here before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypi karqani.
You know, this would be great.	Yachanki, kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I can't hold on to this anymore.	Manañam kaymantaqa hapiyta atiymanchu.
Doing the work for you.	Qampaq llamkayta ruwaspa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
There are two ways to do this.	Chaypaqqa iskay ruwaymi kan.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I thought about it for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi yuyaykurqani.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manan munanchu.
There is a big difference.	Hatun chikan kaymi kan.
It was the truth, yes.	Cheqaq kaqmi karqan, arí.
I, thank you.	Ñuqa, gracias.
I just didn’t know how to do this.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu kayta ruwayta.
You’re probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanki.
Actually, it’s a bit surprising.	Chiqaptaqa, huk chikan admirakuypaqmi.
This time it’s harder.	Kay kutipi aswan sasa.
That’s what he says.	Chaynatam nin.
Now they were vulnerable and frightened.	Kunanqa mana allin qhawarisqa, mancharisqa ima karqanku.
He would never do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
So he knew what was going on.	Chaymi payqa yacharqa imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I knew it would never work out.	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas allin kananta.
He would never do it.	Manam haykapipas ruwanmanchu.
I have a lot to say.	Achka rimanaypaq hinam kachkani.
Three months now.	Kunan kimsa killa.
Everything wasn’t right.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu karqa.
I have never seen this before.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa rikurqanichu.
They were good.	Paykunaqa allinmi karqaku.
He knows how to do the talking.	Payqa yachanmi rimayta ruwayta.
What a name.	Ima sutiyuq.
There all morning.	Chaypi tukuy paqarin.
But something else.	Ichaqa huk imapas.
You didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqankichu.
But that could take some time.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa huk tiempon kanman.
And he’s very angry.	Hinaspa payqa ancha phiñasqa.
What a wonderful first year.	Ima sumaqmi ñawpaq wata.
I never thought about it.	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
Now, if that’s what you mean, fine.	Kunanqa, sichus chayta niyta munanki chayqa, allinmi.
Maybe once or twice, and then it will work out.	Ichapas huk kutita iskay kutita, chaymantaqa allinmi kanqa.
Which was, and still is.	Imataq karqa, kunankamapas kachkan.
Very very difficult.	Ancha ancha sasa.
There is no such thing.	Chay hinaqa manan kanchu.
It’s not like I am.	Manam ñuqa hinachu.
Who got away with it like that.	Pitaq chaynata chaymanta lluqsirqa.
I wanted to say more.	Astawan niyta munarqani.
But that doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa imatapas niyta munanchu.
But in the future.	Ichaqa hamuq tiempopi.
I’m not going to do that right.	Manam allintachu chayta ruwasaq.
I mean, like good.	Niyta munani, allin hina.
Everyone knows that.	Chaytaqa tukuy runakunam yachanku.
Despite all this, he didn't really know what was going on.	Tukuy chayna kaptinpas, manam allintachu yacharqa imakuna kasqanmanta.
You are better at it than I am.	Qamqa ñuqamanta aswan allintam chaypiqa kanki.
I didn’t think much of it.	Manam anchatachu chaypi piensarqani.
But the one there was the best part.	Ichaqa chaypi kaqmi aswan allinqa karqa.
That’s a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi.
This is the time to act.	Kaymi ruwanapaq pacha.
You’re the only one.	Qamllam kanki.
So, there it was, out in the open.	Chaymi, chaypi karqan, hawapi hawapi.
He means well to me, he means well to you.	Payqa allintam niyta munan ñuqawan, payqa allintam niyta munan qamwan.
The process was easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi karqa.
It’s that easy!.	¡Chayna facilmi!.
It was a cold day.	Chiri punchawmi karqa.
It’s easy to say that.	Chaynata rimayqa facilmi.
I know his first name.	Ñawpaq sutinta yachani.
You want to do this today.	Kunan punchaw kayta ruwayta munanki.
In fact, many many times.	Chiqaptaqa, achka achka kutitam.
He was exhausted at the end of the day.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan p’unchay tukukuypi.
So he was in a difficult situation.	Chaymi sasa sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I mean seriously.	Serio niyta munani.
I would love to see more of this!.	¡Anchata munani aswan kaymanta rikuyta!.
That was the only truth.	Chayllam chiqap karqa.
With anyone, really.	Piwanpas, chiqaptapuni.
I’m not a morning person.	Manam paqarin runachu kani.
There are several things you can do.	Kanmi achka ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq.
From me, he said.	Ñoqamanta, nispa.
Everything is absurd.	Tukuy imapas mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I can’t beat it.	Manam atipayta atiymanchu.
You can’t leave it.	Manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
To the party.	Fiestaman.
I want to talk about it again.	Hukmanta rimayta munani.
Want a little bit of that?	¿Munawaqchu huk chhikanta chayta?
But it doesn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nin.
It says a lot.	Achkatam nin.
Do you agree with me?.	¿Ñoqawan acuerdopichu kanki?.
He did it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chayta ruwaq.
John wants to walk around the city.	Juanqa llaqtata puriyta munan.
He didn’t do that.	Manam chaynatachu ruwarqa.
He said it was ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam nisqa.
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinqa.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
I don’t need that this morning.	Manam kunan paqarin chaytaqa necesitasaqchu.
That was something else.	Chayqa huk imapas karqa.
It’s not difficult.	Manam sasachu.
What’s the right thing.	Imataq allin.
One day he rides his bike to school.	Huk p’unchaymi bicicletapi escuelaman rin.
He’s the one who did it.	Paymi chayta ruwarqa.
But that would mean less money for him.	Ichaqa chaywanqa pisi qolqetan paypaq kanman.
Two.	Iskay.
But that is what he had to do.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwanan karqa.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan atinchu.
I don’t have those things.	Manam chaykunataqa kanchu.
I don't remember what day it is.	Manam yuyarinichu ima punchawmi.
He is always right.	Payqa sapa kutim allinta rimachkan.
They know that.	Chaytaqa yachanku.
Now I question everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam tapukuni.
When is the best time to do this?	¿Hayk’aqmi allin kanman chayta ruwanapaq?
If that matters.	Sichus chay importante kanman chayqa.
He is indeed.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin.
Sure, why not.	Seguro, imaraykutaq mana.
I don’t like him.	Payqa manam gustawanchu.
No, no, not this guy.	Mana, mana, mana kay runachu.
Probably the latter.	Yaqapaschá kay qhepa kaq.
All this is a better person.	Tukuy kaymi aswan allin runa.
Everything a good person can be, he is.	Tukuy ima allin runa kanman, paymi.
I don’t know who that might be.	Mana yachanichu pichus chay kanman chayta.
There is a better alternative.	Aswan allin huk ruwaymi kan.
Two things about this.	Iskay imakuna kaymanta.
He had no idea how he did it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna ruwasqanmanta.
But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
I couldn’t hold him.	Manam paytaqa hapiyta atirqanichu.
He was always really nice or really ugly.	Payqa sapa kutim chiqap sumaq utaq chiqap millay karqa.
It was indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin karqan.
She realized he wasn't going anywhere.	Payqa repararqanmi mana maymanpas risqanmanta.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu ima pasananta.
Someone must be an adult.	Pipas kuraq runa kanan.
It’s hard for him.	Paypaq sinchi.
That’s right, isn’t it.	Chayqa, ¿manachu.
He couldn’t do otherwise.	Payqa manan hukta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ichapas, ichapas, ichapas.
Clearly, they are not.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu kanku.
Then, we agree.	Chaymantaqa, acuerdopi kayku.
I don't think so.	Chaytaqa mana hinam hapini.
I don't know why he didn't.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But he probably wouldn't have done anything.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana imatapas ruwanmanchu karqan.
He tried to help her.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi yanapananpaq.
That sounds really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi uyarikun.
Now it will soon be better.	Kunanqa pisi tiempollamantan aswan allin kanqa.
No, maybe it’s better not.	Manan, ichapas aswan allin kanman mana.
I had no idea what was going on.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Several times, in fact.	Achka kuti, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe it’s better to walk away.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman puriyta.
I didn’t want to hear it.	Manam uyariyta munarqanichu.
Maybe it was just that.	Ichapas chaylla karqa.
Of course, this is not easy.	Arí, kayqa manam facilchu.
I want to see it every day.	Sapa punchawmi qawayta munani.
He had no choice, not really.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
Anything less than that is a bad thing.	Chaymanta pisi imapas mana allin ruwaymi.
If this was a problem, he couldn't say.	Sichus kay sasachakuy karqan chayqa, manan niyta atirqanchu.
He didn’t mean it would be okay.	Payqa manan allinchu kanqa niyta munarqanchu.
It was a thing of the past.	Chayqa ñawpaq tiempopi kaqmi karqa.
You want to be in action.	Ruwaypi kaytam munanki.
This is pretty stupid.	Kayqa ancha sonso.
I think it will be good.	Yuyaykuni allin kanqa.
This guy seems confused.	Kay runaqa pantasqa hinam kachkan.
She looked at him quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan payta qhawarirqan.
I thought you were someone else.	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
It would be better if you didn’t.	Mana chayta ruwaptikiqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I can’t do it, man.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu, runa.
I’m the only one.	Ñuqaqa chayllam kani.
He didn’t know anymore.	Manañan yacharqanchu.
It doesn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakun.
I’m doing that.	Chaytaqa ruwani.
Please tell me.	Ama hina kaspa niy.
He wanted to stay involved.	Payqa hinallam chay ruwaypi kayta munarqa.
He couldn’t tell.	Mana willayta atirqachu.
He had better go.	Aswan allinmi karqan rinan.
And what anyone needs.	Hinaspa imatachus pipas necesitan chayta.
I didn’t go either.	Ñuqapas manam rirqanichu.
Anyway, thanks again.	Imayna kaptinpas, hukmanta gracias.
He really should be.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kanan.
Actually, I know that.	Chiqaptaqa chaytam yachani.
And he doesn’t know.	Hinaspa mana yachanchu.
I want to do this right.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwayta munani.
He never thought of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
The previous process was never like this.	Ñawpaq ruwayqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu karqan.
He tried, he really did.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi, cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
This was always a failure.	Chay ruwasqanqa sapa kutim mana allinchu karqa.
You'll probably get caught.	Yaqapaschá hap'isqa kanki.
Now he was in no position to do so.	Kunanqa manan imapipas chayta ruwananpaqqa karqanchu.
And you know that well.	Hinaspa chaytaqa allintam yachanki.
That was about two years ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Not according to any other method.	Mana huk ruwayman hinachu.
He was quick, but not fast enough.	Payqa usqhayllan karqan, ichaqa manan usqhayllachu karqan.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
Like this morning.	Kunan paqarin hina.
If you haven’t, do it now.	Mana chayta ruwarqanki chayqa, kunan ruway.
He was not very happy.	Payqa manam ancha kusisqachu tarikurqa.
He told you to do it.	Paymi chayta ruwanaykipaq nisurqanki.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan karqan.
Is there a reason you did it?	¿Kanchu imaraykupas chayta ruwarqanki?
But he kept doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam chayta ruwarqa.
They were depressed.	Paykunaqa llakisqa karqanku.
That went well enough.	Chayqa allintam rirqa.
He couldn’t help but.	Manam atirqachu mana.
But I can’t find it.	Ichaqa manan tarinichu.
I don't remember what he said.	Manam yuyarinichu ima nisqanta.
He knows how to tell a story.	Payqa huk willakuyta willayta yachan.
That’s the crazy thing.	Chayqa loco kaqmi.
I’ve heard that.	Chaytaqa uyarirqanim.
I don’t know why or when.	Manam yachanichu imarayku nitaq haykapi.
Scientists are not sure why.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa manam allintachu yachanku imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I would like to know how to solve this problem.	Kay sasachakuy allichayta yachayta munani.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
Yes, you are right there.	Arí, allintam chaypi kachkanki.
I can't wait to see it.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu qawayta.
A big problem.	Hatun sasachakuy.
He went out alone.	Payqa sapallanmi lluqsirqa.
Every bad year.	Sapa millay wata.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manan allin ruwaychu.
But there is.	Ichaqa kanmi.
There was no one.	Manan pipas karqanchu.
He died two years later.	Iskay wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
As always, she looked great.	Sapa kuti hinam ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq karqa.
He was supposed to be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanan karqa.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
You may not want that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa munankichu.
It was better there.	Chaypiqa aswan allinmi karqa.
That’s probably the most familiar to you.	Chayqa ichapas aswan riqsisqa qampaq.
The process did not work.	Chay ruwayqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
But that was not the case, he knew.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
He never wanted to do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
Everything on time.	Tukuy imapas tiempollanpi.
Crazy good that is.	Loco allin chaymi.
It turned out well.	Allintam lluqsirqa.
He didn’t know who it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pichus chay runa kasqanmanta.
I know how a person feels.	Yachanim huk runa imayna sientekusqanmanta.
He wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa.
It would be so much better.	Ancha aswan allinmi kanman.
The process would not be difficult.	Chay ruwayqa manan sasachu kanman.
Another chance, that was it.	Huk chansa, chaymi karqa.
A lot of people.	Ancha achka runakuna.
He couldn’t get over this.	Payqa manan kayta atipayta atirqanchu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
Huge difference !.	Hatun chikan kay !.
Maybe he knew what was coming.	Ichapas payqa yacharqa imakuna hamunanta.
There’s everything in there.	Chaypim tukuy imapas kachkan.
He couldn't figure out what it was.	Manas ima kasqanmanta yachayta atirqachu.
That’s what it looked like.	Chayqa rikchakurqa.
I’m sure, like me.	Seguro kani, ñuqa hina.
There have always been a few fools	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi iskay kimsa mana yuyayniyuq runakunaqa karqa
I was sad this time last year.	Qayna wata kay kutipi llakisqa karqani.
He’s crazy about me.	Payqa ñuqamanta loco kachkan.
He never thought to ask her about it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu chaymanta tapuyta.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
We didn’t talk much.	Manam anchatachu rimaq kayku.
A whole new world for me.	Huk musuq pacha ñuqapaq.
If you don’t want to, don’t do it.	Mana munaspaqa ama ruwaychu.
No, that is not true.	Manan, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I was always surprised by it.	Sapa kutim chaymanta admirakurqani.
I think everybody was happy.	Yuyaykuni llapa runa kusisqa kasqankuta.
But they are not like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanku.
The people were happy.	Runakunaqa kusisqam karqaku.
He said so quickly.	Chayna utqayllam nirqa.
And unfortunately there are people like that.	Hinaspa llakikuypaqmi kan chayna runakuna.
But it’s not easy at all.	Ichaqa manan imapipas facilchu.
That’s what I did.	Chaytan ruwarqani.
He had been here before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kaypi kasqa.
I'm serious.	Serio kachkani.
If you want to say something, say it.	Imatapas niyta munaspaqa niy.
And so, it was crazy.	Hinaspa chayna, loco karqa.
There is something else.	Huk imapas kanmi.
That was a sure thing.	Chayqa segurom karqa.
Then there is every.	Chaymantaqa kanmi sapa.
But this morning.	Ichaqa kunan paqarinmi.
It seemed like a long time ago.	Unayñam rikchakurqa.
The important thing.	Importante kaq.
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani.
This is you guys.	Kayqa qanmi kanki.
Never.	Mana hayk’aqpas.
That’s why he wants her.	Chayraykum payta munan.
No one seems to know the truth.	Manapaschá pipas cheqaq kaqta yachanchu.
What is another?.	¿Imataq huk?.
He is nobody.	Payqa manan pipas kanchu.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
This is your responsibility.	Kaymi qampa ruwanayki.
You have to do what you have to do.	Imatachus ruwanayki tiyan chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Maybe he’s the person you want.	Ichapas payqa munasqayki runa kanman.
So he did it.	Chaymi payqa ruwarqa.
I know this is wrong.	Yachanim kayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
I can’t say what will happen.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta.
Everything is too good.	Tukuy imapas llumpay allinmi.
And then it happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta pasarqa.
I mean, it's not good at all.	Niyta munani, manam allinchu ni imapipas.
And better than that, you told him.	Hinaspa chaymanta aswan allinqa, payta nirqanki.
He’ll be here.	Payqa kaypi kanqa.
But that’s a big if.	Ichaqa chayqa hatun sichus.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ichapas manam imananpaschu.
But that was all.	Ichaqa chayllam karqa.
He wasn’t there.	Manam chaypichu karqa.
I don't think he really will.	Manam piensanichu chiqaptapuni chayta ruwanqa.
No, it’s not yet.	Manan, manaraqmi.
This is great, really great.	Kayqa ancha allinmi, chiqap hatunmi.
I'll do that.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq.
Now it’s there.	Kunanqa chaypi kachkan.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
But that is not the best way to do it.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa aswan allinchu.
That is the first step.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi.
I’ll be there.	Ñoqaqa kasaq.
But it was very, very cold.	Ichaqa ancha, ancha chiri karqa.
Everyone wants some money!	¡Lliwmi wakin qullqita munanku!
But now it doesn't matter.	Kunanqa ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Very quickly.	Ancha utqaylla.
Everything you want.	Tukuy ima munasqayki.
He won’t be there now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kanqachu.
I don't know what the problem is.	Manam yachanichu ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
They certainly weren’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqanku.
He was outstanding tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam ancha allin karqa.
That is a very sad thing.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
He really, really doesn't care.	Payqa chiqaptapuni, chiqaptaqa manam imananpaschu.
A lot of people have been there for me.	Achka runakunam ñuqapaq chaypi karqaku.
They have no reason.	Paykunaqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
I am sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
Say so, anyway.	Chaynata niy, imayna kaptinpas.
He has been with me for a very long time.	Payqa ancha unayñam ñuqawan kachkan.
But ten means ten.	Ichaqa chunka niyta munan chunka.
No, it doesn’t exist.	Manan, manan kanchu.
I haven’t done that before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
Take a chance.	Huk chansa ruway.
No, he didn’t know where he was going to be.	Manan, manan yacharqanchu maypi kananta.
Same appearance.	Kikin rikchayniyuq.
She says she can’t believe it.	Payqa ninmi mana creeyta atisqanmanta.
It’s sad to say.	Llakikuypaqmi niyta.
It was good to talk to him.	Paywan rimayqa allinmi karqa.
That can be devastating.	Chayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi kanman.
No one knew exactly what to do.	Manan pipas allintachu yacharqan ima ruwananta.
Learn a new language.	Huk musuq simita yachay.
We are happy together.	Kuska kusisqam kachkaniku.
But that’s the other one.	Ichaqa chay huknin.
I didn’t see why.	Manam rikurqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I've had it for a long time.	Unayñan chayta hap'ini.
He told me that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi niwarqa.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
Obviously he didn’t do it right.	Sut’inmi mana allintachu ruwasqanmanta.
And that’s all there is to it.	Hinaspa chaylla kachkan.
Can't do it tonight.	Mana kunan tuta ruwayta atinchu.
What in the world.	Imataq kay pachapi.
Everything had to be done right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwana karqa.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Mana ima niyta munanchu.
I don't know this.	Kaytaqa manam yachanichu.
I mean, he doesn't.	Niyta munani, payqa manam.
I can’t wait to hear how it goes.	Manam suyayta atinichu imayna pasasqanmanta uyariyta.
It’s a human being.	Huk runam.
They were terrified.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
Is it just that?	¿Chayllachu?
Yes you are the one.	Arí qanmi kanki.
That’s why it was so popular.	Chayraykum ancha riqsisqa karqa.
I'm still in awe.	Hinallam mancharisqa kachkani.
I don’t like to talk about it.	Manam gustawanchu chaymanta rimayqa.
Proud, and, perhaps, foolish man.	Orgulloso, hinaspa, ichapas, mana yuyayniyuq runa.
I know he knows.	Yachanim payqa yachasqanmanta.
And he did it.	Hinan payqa ruwarqan.
You don’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munankichu.
I don’t need anything.	Manam imatapas necesitasaqchu.
I am well aware of this.	Kaymantaqa allintam yachani.
This is the really important stuff.	Kayqa cheqaq importante kaqmi.
But this was much bigger.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan hatunmi karqan.
Don’t ever do that.	Ama hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaychu.
But I don’t know why.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa.
This was taken wrong.	Kayqa pantasqa hap'isqa karqan.
But I can say this.	Ichaqa kaytan niyta atiyman.
He did everything he could for me.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinam ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
It’s okay to feel sad and depressed at times.	Allinmi kanman wakin kutipi llakisqa hinaspa llakisqa kayqa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Who knows where.	Pi yachan maypi.
He thought it was the right thing to do.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruway allin kananpaq.
This is what he did.	Kaytam ruwarqa.
He said he couldn't remember much about that night.	Chay tutamanta mana anchata yuyariyta atisqanmanta nirqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
He was truly the nicest person.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin aswan sumaq runa karqan.
He doesn’t want to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munanchu.
It certainly could not have been otherwise.	Cheqaqtapunin mana huk hinachu kanman karqan.
They were great.	Paykunaqa hatunmi karqaku.
I am disappointed in the situation.	Chayna kasqanmantam hukmanyasqa kachkani.
They are good ones.	Paykunaqa allinmi kanku.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
He kind of does this all the time.	Payqa huk laya kayta ruwan sapa kuti.
And now it’s here.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi kachkan.
Maybe he did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
This will be the best, after all.	Kaymi aswan allin kanqa, tukuy imamanta.
And too scared to say anything.	Hinaspa ancha mancharisqa imatapas niyta.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
I want you to be here with me.	Kaypi ñuqawan kanaykita munani.
But what if.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman sichus.
I know they are out there.	Yachanim hawapi kasqankuta.
He didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqa.
This is what you need to do.	Kaytam ruwanayki.
Some great, some not so great.	Wakin hatun, wakin mana chay hina hatun.
The latter did just that.	Chay qhepa kaqmi chayta ruwarqan.
He didn’t notice.	Payqa manan repararqanchu.
I felt hurt.	K’irisqa tarikurqani.
I’m happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kachkani.
He knew what it was now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan ima kasqanmanta.
You know, you’re really nice.	Yachanki, chiqap sumaqmi kanki.
On the contrary, it is not good.	Aswanpas manan allinchu.
I was very impressed.	Anchatam admirakurqani.
I would agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayman.
So that’s a big problem.	Chaymi chayqa hatun sasachakuy.
Tell me the real reason.	Willaway chiqap imarayku kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t stand it.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu.
Let's wait here one night.	Kaypi huk tuta suyasun.
So it’s not worth it.	Chaymi mana valenchu.
Today is not that day.	Kunan punchawqa manam chay punchawchu.
I don’t know how to drive.	Manam yachanichu imayna manejayta.
In fact, I am trying to do the same.	Chiqaptaqa ñuqapas chaynatam ruwanaypaq kallpanchakuchkani.
Now it doesn't matter.	Kunanqa ama imananpaschu.
Everything he was.	Tukuy imapas payqa karqa.
I thought it would be good there.	Yuyarqanim allin chaypi kananta.
He is very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kashan.
No one could understand.	Manam pipas entiendeyta atirqachu.
He is in a hurry.	Payqa usqhayllan kashan.
He certainly used to say that.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hinata rimaq.
I’m really enjoying that.	Chaytaqa anchatam kusikuni.
And then he said.	Hinaspa chaymanta nisqa.
One night really.	Huk tuta chiqap.
Maybe you weren’t there.	Ichapas mana chaypichu karqanki.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Chaypaqqa manam ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
It wasn’t difficult.	Manam sasachu karqa.
He knows what is going to happen.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna pasananta.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
So proud of him.	Chayna orgulloso paymanta.
Everything depends on it.	Tukuy imapas chaymantam kanqa.
So that’s a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa allinmi.
But no one noticed.	Ichaqa manan pipas repararqanchu.
But that is not true.	Ichaqa chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
This is not a valid statement.	Kay nisqanqa manam allinchu.
He had a great game last week.	Payqa qayna semanan hatun pukllayta ruwarqan.
I feel strongly about it.	Sinchitan chaymanta sientekuni.
So young and beautiful.	Chaymi wayna hinaspa sumaq.
She tried but could not speak.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
It’s not worth it.	Manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He was long gone.	Payqa unayñam manaña karqachu.
No one is happy.	Manan pipas kusisqachu kashan.
And the third one.	Hinaspa kimsa kaq.
She was scared, so she stayed home.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa, chaymi wasinpi qhepakurqan.
We’re serious here.	Kaypiqa serio kayku.
Someone must be a non-performer.	Pipas mana ruwaq runa kanan.
He didn’t want to stop her.	Payqa manan hark’ayta munarqanchu.
I think you might do well.	Yuyaykuni ichapas allinta ruwawaq.
Maybe it was someone.	Ichapas pi kasqa.
You go too, too.	Qampas riy.
But thank you.	Ichaqa gracias.
It didn’t go well.	Mana allintachu rirqa.
He was never quite sure why.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yacharqan imarayku chayta.
Maybe it never will be.	Ichapas mana haykapipas kanqachu.
He knew how to go there alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayman riyta yacharqa.
I couldn’t play the game.	Manam pukllayta atirqanichu.
Do you still think this is a "bad" movie?	¿Hinallaraqchu kayta "mana allin" peliculata yuyanki?
This is you that you want to be.	Kaymi kanki chay qanmi kayta munanki.
You can’t do everything.	Manan tukuy imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
It was more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi karqa.
Two are better.	Iskay aswan allin.
I hadn’t heard of it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanichu.
How you go about it is up to you.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwanaykipaqqa qanmanta kanqa.
I knew it wasn't.	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
That if he did, that would be it.	Chayta ruwaptinqa chayna kananta.
But it can’t be the only thing.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kanman.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
What went wrong?.	¿Imataq mana allintachu rirqa?.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
I didn’t hear it.	Manam uyarirqanichu.
He had no idea where he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
This seems strange.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
Not more often than not.	Mana aswan sapa kutichu.
I know that he did.	Yachanim chayna ruwasqanmanta.
He may not be able to do that with me.	Chaytaqa manapaschá ñoqawanqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
Who lives here?	¿Pitaq kaypi tiyan?
Or the adults.	Utaq kuraq runakuna.
I want alone time with you.	Qanwan sapallay tiempota munani.
The sooner you do this, the better.	Aswan utqaylla kayta ruwanki chayqa, aswan allinmi.
He’s rather right about it.	Payqa aswan allintan chaymanta riman.
That's pretty obvious.	Chayqa ancha sut'inmi.
I wanted this to happen.	Ñuqaqa kaytam munarqani.
He can do anything.	Tukuy imata ruwayta atin.
I know you don't mean it.	Yachanim mana chayta niyta munasqaykita.
But he knows the problem, at least.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay sasachakuymanta, aswanpas.
That’s what I mean.	Chayna niyta.
Which was nice.	Imataq sumaq karqa.
A week ago.	Huk semana ñawpaqta.
In fact, it is very simple.	Aswanpas ancha facilmi.
There was no one there.	Chaypiqa manam pipas karqachu.
Great.	Hatun.
That makes some sense like no one else.	Chayqa mana pipas hinam wakin yuyayniyuq.
There were three strangers in town that day.	Chay punchawmi llaqtapi kimsa mana riqsisqa runakuna karqaku.
Maybe a little bit.	Ichapas huk chikan.
It was always the next time.	Sapa kutim qatiqnin kutipi karqa.
I couldn’t sit still.	Manam tiyayta atirqanichu.
He later died.	Qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I have a better idea.	Aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I don’t know why he did this, but it looked really good.	Mana yachanichu imarayku kayta ruwarqa, ichaqa chiqamanta allin rikch’akurqa.
He wanted her to hurry.	Payqa munarqanmi usqhaylla ruwananta.
That’s what I wanted to tell you.	Chaytan willayta munarqani.
I haven’t done that yet.	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan hinachu karqan.
We’re all the same.	Llapanchismi.
Nothing is ever as good as in high school.	Colegiopi hinaqa manan imapas hayk’aqpas allinchu.
I'll do that later this week.	Chaytaqa kay semana tukuyta ruwasaq.
But you are very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi kanki.
So it’s going to be really important there.	Chaymi chaypiqa ancha importante kanqa.
I do not agree with this.	Kaytaqa manam acuerdopichu kani.
He is like everyone else.	Payqa llapa runa hinam.
No, it’s not the only thing.	Manan, manan chayllachu.
I didn’t hear it right.	Manam allintachu uyarirqani.
This is what he wanted.	Kaymi payqa munarqa.
They were the same as before.	Paykunaqa ñawpaq hinam karqaku.
Do tell me.	Ruway willaway.
Soon, it could be.	Pisi tiempollamantan, chayna kanman.
Maybe he’s crazy.	Ichapas payqa loco kachkan.
This process is currently available.	Kay ruwayqa kunanmi kachkan.
He doesn’t want a party or anything.	Payqa manan munanchu fiestata nitaq imatapas.
The first is the most common method.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan riqsisqa ruwayqa.
Do one tomorrow.	Paqarin hukta ruway.
So I’m not ready.	Chaymi mana listochu kani.
If you do, you can do things right.	Chaynata ruwaspaqa allintam imatapas ruwawaq.
But it was always there.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
I don’t know what.	Manam yachanichu imata.
There he was again.	Chaypim yapamanta kasqa.
And then he said he needed some sleep.	Hinaspa chaymanta nirqa wakin puñuyta necesitasqanmanta.
There is no one there.	Manam pipas chaypiqa kanchu.
It was hidden out there.	Chaypin hawapi pakasqa karqan.
But this is it.	Ichaqa kaymi.
This is the same person.	Kay kikin runa.
He was truly on his own now.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kunanqa sapallan kasharqan.
What did he mean by that? 	¿Ima niyta munarqa?
He was happy to be able to help her.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa payta yanapayta atisqanmanta.
I think that’s great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensani.
Another chance.	Huk chansa.
And then something strange happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk mana riqsisqa imapas pasarqa.
So it wouldn’t be much.	Chaymi mana anchatachu kanman.
I just wanted to keep going.	Hinallam riyta munarqani.
He can’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atinchu.
This would not be such a big deal.	Kayqa manam chayna hatun ruwaychu kanman.
And really, they’re great.	Hinaspa chiqap, paykunaqa hatunmi kanku.
I haven’t seen this before.	Manam kayta rikurqanichu ñawpaqta.
I had no idea where it was.	Manam piensarqanichu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
He looked at her carefully.	Payqa allinta qhawarisqa.
He never had to do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanan karqanchu.
I don't see how that would help.	Manam rikunichu chayna imayna yanapananta.
I don't like it here, you know.	Kaypiqa manam gustawanchu, yachanki.
It was really nice.	Chiqamanta sumaq karqa.
I won’t be here anymore.	Manañam kaypichu kasaq.
Obviously, he didn’t know what to do.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
Nothing could stop him.	Manam imapas harkayta atirqachu.
Then ten the same day.	Chaymanta chunka kikin punchaw.
Not a time like today.	Mana kunan pacha hina pacha.
Maybe next time!.	Ichapas hamuq kutipi!.
I want to keep doing that.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwayta munani.
Please, say so.	Ama hina kaspa, niy.
Learn a new language.	Musuq simita yachay.
We did it all this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi tukuy chayta ruwarqayku.
They were very hungry.	Paykunaqa anchatam yarqasqa karqaku.
But you’re not up to it.	Ichaqa manan chayman hinachu kanki.
Otherwise, you never know what could happen.	Mana chayqa, manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus kanman chayta.
It was very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi karqan.
Herein lies the greater problem.	Kaypim aswan hatun sasachakuy kachkan.
I can't do anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu’.
That’s a remarkable thing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
I mean, they were really tired.	Niyta munani, paykunaqa chiqamanta sayk’usqa karqanku.
We’re not there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu kachkaniku.
I hope they are recent.	Suyachkani chayllaraq kasqankuta.
He will be amazing.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi kanqa.
But this was pretty big.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
It wouldn’t be difficult.	Manam sasachu kanman.
Hardly a secret.	Yaqapaschá pakasqa hinachu.
But I want to find a way.	Ichaqa huk ñanta tariyta munani.
As a teacher.	Yachachiq hina.
In fact, that is not true.	Aswanpas chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
On a weekend.	Huk semana tukukuypi.
If you do the right thing.	Sichus allinta ruwanki chayqa.
I feel sorry for him now.	Kunanqa paymanta llakikuni.
You can’t talk about it.	Mana rimayta atiwaqchu.
I wanted to be someone.	Pipas kaytam munarqani.
Art.	Sumaq ruway.
It’s very nice, he said.	Ancha sumaqmi, nispa.
That’s all I was.	Chayllam ñuqa karqani.
You'd rather go without us.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana ñuqaykuwan riy.
What do they know?.	¿Imatataq yachanku?.
Now this is very good.	Kunanqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
He looked older than me.	Payqa ñuqamanta kuraq runam rikchakurqa.
He was immediately serious.	Payqa chayllam serio karqa.
I am a scientist.	Yachaysapa runam kani.
The worst part was, he was right.	Aswan mana allinqa karqa, payqa chiqaptam nirqa.
The latter approach is useful in this case.	Kay qhipa kaq ruwayqa allinmi kaypiqa.
It’s been a long time since then.	Chaymantaqa unayñam kachkan.
Three things happened today.	Kunan punchawmi kimsa imapas pasarqa.
That’s what it’s supposed to be.	Chaytaqa ruwana.
He has to go now.	Payqa kunanmi rinan.
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
I’m sure he did.	Seguro kani chay ruwasqanmanta.
He opened the door.	Paymi punkuta kicharirqa.
I wasn’t the only one.	Manam chayllachu karqani.
Today was a big one.	Kunan punchawqa hatunmi karqa.
In fact, it seems to be.	Aswanpas, chayna hinam kachkan.
It didn’t seem so important anymore.	Manañan ancha importante hinachu karqan.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta munarqanchu.
I'm just not sure if that's bad of me or not.	Chaylla mana segurochu kani sichus chay mana allinchu ñuqamanta icha manachu.
If you were here.	Sichus kaypi karqanki chayqa.
That was the only thing that mattered.	Chayllam imapaqpas allin karqa.
It wasn’t there.	Manam karqachu.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
The statement was ambiguous.	Chay rimayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I didn’t know what.	Manam yacharqanichu imata.
It can’t be true, it can’t be true.	Manan cheqaqchu kanman, manan cheqaqchu kanman.
It was a very serious injury.	Ancha hatun k’irisqa karqan.
This is obviously a very difficult problem.	Kayqa sut’inmi ancha sasa sasachakuy.
I don’t know how you do it.	Manam yachanichu imayna ruwasqaykita.
Please, please, please.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa.
He cannot tell her who he is.	Payqa manam willayta atinchu pi kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to eat that food.	Chay mikhunata mana mikhuyta munanichu.
He sounds like he wants to say more.	Payqa astawan niyta munanman hinam uyarikun.
I was one of them.	Ñuqaqa hukninmi karqani.
He needs it so badly.	Payqa anchatan necesitan.
But it had to be there.	Ichaqa chaypi kanan karqan.
What do you do?.	Imatataq ruwanki?.
I’m doing this.	Kayta ruwani.
Now, however, he could not.	Kunanmi ichaqa mana atirqachu.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam kachkan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kasqa.
I think you've done a fantastic job.	Yuyaykuni ancha sumaq llamk'ayta ruwasqaykita.
What is that.	Imataq chay.
Maybe a newer one.	Ichapas aswan musuq.
He knows the timing is right.	Payqa yachanmi tiempo allin kasqanmanta.
There are many people who want to help.	Chaypiqa achka runakunam yanapayta munanku.
But he didn’t know that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
Then again, it’s.	Chaymanta yapamanta.
I don't want to think about it too much either.	Ñuqapas manam anchatachu yuyaymanayta munani.
I did it twice.	Iskay kutitam ruwarqani.
It probably still exists.	Yaqapaschá kunankamapas kachkan.
This is the right time.	Kaymi allin tiempo.
I know that it is not.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
Why would you do that?.	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwawaq?.
A food true day.	Huk mikhuy chiqap p’unchaw.
How you should do it.	Imaynatataq ruwanayki.
But that’s what it does.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwan.
This was the younger one.	Kayqa sullk’a kaqmi karqan.
Now he doesn’t want to.	Kunanqa manan munanchu.
It wasn’t a pretty thing.	Manam sumaq ruwaychu karqa.
People with intelligence.	Yuyayniyuq runakuna.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
No one thought they were great.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu hatun kasqankuta.
I thought it was really good.	Chiqap allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
This is a good idea	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi
For now, that’s it.	Kunankamaqa, chaymi.
But they are not there yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chaypichu kashanku.
But it’s only recently.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi.
I know, I do, too.	Yachanim, ñuqapas.
I don't like this.	Kaytaqa manam gustawanchu.
The smartest.	Aswan yachaysapa.
Who says that?	¿Pitaq chayta nin?
Sick, sick, sick.	Unqusqa, unqusqa, unqusqa.
But, but, but.	Ichaqa, ichaqa, ichaqa.
You’re not ready yet.	Manaraqmi listochu kanki.
I still don't know for sure.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu yachani.
I learned that later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi yacharqani.
It will be much, much better.	Ancha, aswan allinmi kanqa.
Maybe it really is.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni chayna.
If you’re not happy, we’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, manan kusisqachu kayku.
He said it several times.	Achka kutitam nirqa.
He can barely see.	Payqa yaqapaschá rikuyta atin.
That’s why it’s so important.	Chayraykum ancha allin.
I couldn’t find the money to make the film.	Chay peliculata ruwanaypaqqa manan qolqeta tariyta atirqanichu.
And he said yes.	Hinan payqa arí nisqa.
One of the teachers here offered me a ride home.	Kaypi huknin yachachiqmi wasiyman carropi rinaypaq niwarqa.
But it’s probably.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá.
He wanted to be something else.	Payqa huk imapas kaytam munarqa.
Even today.	Kunankamapas.
It’s not always a good thing.	Manam sapa kutichu allin kaq.
That’s the latter.	Chayqa qhipa kaqmi.
I want to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munani.
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi.
It was a good time.	Allin tiempon karqan.
No one knew what he was doing there alone.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu chaypi sapallan ima ruwasqanmanta.
Forgive me, boy.	Pampachaykuway, wayna.
A really great guy.	Chiqap hatun runa.
I hear that every couple of days.	Chaytaqa sapa iskay kimsa punchawmi uyarini.
That’s what he did.	Chaytaqa ruwarqa.
It’s better to be that way.	Aswan allinmi chayna kayqa.
But he didn't do that.	Payqa ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It looks good.	Allinmi rikchakun.
So this is a new thing.	Chaymi kayqa musuq kaq.
I just did a couple of jobs.	Chayllaraqmi huk iskay llamkayta ruwarqani.
He didn’t want to be anywhere.	Payqa manan maypipas kayta munarqanchu.
But he never knew why, he said.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu imarayku chayta, nispa.
That’s all,’ he said.	Chayllam’, nispa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But he may not do that.	Ichaqa manapaschá chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
Have a nice day.	Qampaq allin punchaw.
You’re going to be there.	Chaypim kanki.
But it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas mana allinchu ñoqawan kashasqanmanta.
No one should do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwananchu.
You know that, you know.	Chaytaqa yachanki.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Two children.	Iskay wawa.
He is doing it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwachkan.
He didn’t know why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chayta.
I want it so much.	Anchatam munani.
I feel so lucky.	Ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni.
He was like a man.	Payqa huk runa hinam karqa.
It was a beautiful sight.	Sumaqmi karqa.
Three hours ago.	Kimsa hora ñawpaqta.
Say it’s great.	Niy ancha allinmi nispa.
Probably something is not very good.	Yaqapaschá imapas mana ancha allinchu.
And now he's hurt again.	Hinaspa kunanqa yapamanta k'irisqa.
He was probably ready for that.	Chaypaqqa yaqapaschá listo kasharqan.
I couldn't believe he was gone.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu manaña kasqanmantaqa.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.

You go, you.	Qamqa riy, qam.
We must continue to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwananchik.
I didn’t see him in action.	Manam paytaqa ruwaypi rikurqanichu.
This is outside the box.	Kayqa hawapi kachkan.
One last thing.	Huk qhipa kaq.
What does it look like.	Imataq rikchakun.
I wonder what’s easier.	Tapukuni imataq aswan facil kasqanmanta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
And if it doesn't.	Hinaspa mana chayna kaptinqa.
Then go for it.	Chaymanta riy.
But he is no longer there.	Ichaqa manañan chaypichu kashan.
He doesn’t want her to do that.	Mana chayta ruwananta munan.
I was a no-brainer.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
Nothing is easy here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas facilchu.
Good for him, man.	Allinmi paypaq, runa.
But I didn’t think this would work.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu kayqa allin kananta.
But he wouldn’t want to be left alone anywhere.	Ichaqa manan maypipas sapallan qhepakuyta munanmanchu karqan.
You seem to be nervous.	Qamqa mancharisqa hinam kanki.
I don’t like the guy.	Manam gustawanchu chay runa.
He went there very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam chayman rirqa.
So it was one of the first things he knew.	Chaymi ñawpaq yachasqanmanta huknin karqa.
Everything that was wrong, that was me.	Tukuy ima mana allin kaq, chaymi ñuqa karqani.
The process is fairly simple.	Chay ruwayqa allin facilmi.
The next sentence is a function.	Qatiqnin rimayqa huk ruwaymi.
Something about it was all wrong.	Imapas chaymanta tukuy mana allinchu karqa.
I know he knows.	Yachanim yachasqanmanta.
That sounds so simple, but it wasn’t.	Chayqa ancha facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
You don’t want to be like him.	Manan pay hina kayta munankichu.

Everyone wants to play every day.	Lliwmi sapa punchaw pukllayta munanku.

Yes, that would be a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi kanman.
But it’s pretty big.	Ichaqa allin hatunmi.
No one knows why.	Manan pipas yachanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
But no one thought of it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
Beautiful child.	Sumaq wawa.
He couldn't remember.	Payqa manam yuyariyta atirqachu.
Both of them were good.	Iskayninkum allin karqaku.

I know you know how it is.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta yachasqaykita.
He can’t answer for you.	Manan qanpaq kutichiyta atinmanchu.
He couldn't be sure.	Payqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
But things won’t stay that way for long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu imapas chhayna kanqa.
The man thinks, well.	Chay runaqa yuyaykun, allinta.
Probably next time.	Yaqapaschá qhepa kutipi.
And so they were.	Hinaspa chayna karqaku.

He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
I have said it many times.	Achka kutitam nirqani.

Anyway this may not be a good idea.	Imayna kaptinpas kayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
They have been here for three years.	Kimsa watañam kaypi kachkanku.
Can't help now.	Mana kunan yanapayta atinchu.
He just shouldn't be.	Payqa hinallam mana kanan.
No, it wasn’t anywhere.	Manan, manan maypipas karqanchu.
He was being extremely serious.	Payqa sinchi sinchitan kasharqan.
On the contrary, he was happy to be with her.	Aswanpas kusisqan kasharqan paywan kuska kasqanmanta.
Twenty years ago now.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqta kunan.
Seriously I’m here.	Serio kaypi kachkani.
How did you do it.	Imaynatataq ruwarqanki.
It looked very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
It’s that simple.	Chayna facilmi.
Worse, he couldn't.	Aswan mana allinqa, manam atirqachu.
I highly doubt that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam iskayrayani.
It was a proud moment.	Chayqa karqan orgulloso rato.
No one wants to be that person.	Manam pipas chay runa kayta munanchu.
Many are just like him.	Achka payta hinallam.
He didn’t want to know what happened.	Payqa manan imachus pasasqanmanta yachayta munarqanchu.

Both of them.	Iskayninku.
You think about the end of the year.	Wata tukukuypi yuyaykunki.
We made the food.	Mikhunata ruwarqayku.
So, it was not difficult at all.	Chaymi, manam sasachu karqa ni imapipas.
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqa.
I can't go there now.	Chaymanqa manam kunanqa riyta atiymanchu.
It was hard, hard, hard.	Sinchi, sinchi, sinchi karqan.
I can’t seem to remember his name.	Manapaschá sutinta yuyariyta atiymanchu.
He’s black.	Payqa yana.
Well, the same person.	Allin, kikin runa.
It will not be good there.	Chaypiqa manam allinchu kanqa.

You were amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi karqanki.
So he’s the one.	Chaymi payqa.
He knew what he was doing.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu.
Many many times.	Achka achka kuti.

Obviously that’s not the case here.	Sut’inmi kaypi mana chay hinachu.
He knew he wouldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana ruwananta.
I didn’t see where you did this.	Manam rikurqanichu maypi kayta ruwasqaykita.
He wasn’t there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kasqa.
He said, 'It's.	Paymi nirqa.
He had to be alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kanan karqa.
And take a walk.	Hinaspa huk puriyta ruway.

But no one could.	Ichaqa manan pipas atirqanchu.

He saw it as an opportunity.	Chaytaqa huk oportunidadta hinan qhawarirqan.
Tell me which item is your favorite.	Willaway mayqin imapas aswan munasqayki kasqanmanta.

That’s obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi.
He says why.	Paymi nin imarayku.

You’re so great!	¡Ancha hatunmi kanki!
He gave it to me.	Quwarqa.
I think that will continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa nispam piensani.
No one seems to want to do that.	Manapaschá pipas chayta ruwayta munanmanchu hina.

Okay, so maybe not.	Allinmi, chaymi ichapas mana.
But he doesn’t have to.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwananchu.
Obviously it does.	Sut’inmi chaytaqa ruwan.
We’ve had this talk before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kay rimayta ruwarqayku.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu.
He has no idea what he needs to do.	Payqa manan yuyaykunchu ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.

This was the night.	Kaymi tuta kasqa.
That’s what he does.	Chaytan payqa ruwan.
But otherwise, nothing.	Ichaqa mana chayqa, manan imapas.
This is actually quite simple.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa ancha sasam.
Not sure what this is about.	Mana segurochu imamanta kayqa.
But I didn’t see him.	Ichaqa manan paytaqa rikurqanichu.
He had been married before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi casarasqa kasqa.
All that drunk.	Tukuy chayta machasqa.
But he was fired a few weeks after that.	Ichaqa chaymanta iskay kinsa semana qhepamanmi qarqosqa karqan.

And he accepted it.	Hinan payqa chayta chaskirqan.

But this is what he could do.	Ichaqa kaytan ruwayta atinman karqan.
There is something else, or not.	Huk imapas kanmi, icha manachu.
You probably do the same thing.	Qampas yaqapaschá chayta ruwanki.

He continues to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwachkan.
He knew it beforehand.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqa.
But it’s almost not good enough.	Ichaqa yaqa mana allinchu.
Maybe he really did.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni chayta ruwarqa.
He wanted to know more.	Payqa astawan yachayta munarqa.
Maybe that’s a good thing though.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman ichaqa.
I don’t want him to know about this.	Manam munanichu kaymanta yachananta.
I'm sure it is.	Seguro kani chayna kasqanmanta.
He wanted to leave.	Payqa ripuyta munarqa.
I knew it was wrong.	Yacharqanim mana allin kasqanmanta.

Maybe just about anything for sure.	Ichapas yaqa imapas kanman seguro.
Maybe he was really sick.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni unqusqa karqa.
He certainly did that.	Chiqamanta chayta ruwarqa.
Clearly it’s not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
That’s the important thing here.	Chayqa kaypi importante kaqmi.
Good kid, though.	Allin wawa, ichaqa.
You did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqanki.

There was no reason not to do it.	Manam imaraykupas mana ruwanaypaqqa karqachu.
Go ahead, please.	Riy, ama hina kaspa.

I couldn't bear to see or hear him.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu payta qawayta, uyariyta.
But he didn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
The man said he wasn’t happy.	Chay runaqa mana kusisqachu kasqanta nirqa.
Not sure about that.	Mana chaymanta segurochu.
Still, he did it.	Chayna kaptinpas chaytam ruwarqa.
And then what.	Hinaspa chaymanta ima.
He died about two days later.	Payqa yaqa iskay p’unchay qhepamanmi wañupurqan.

I’m very, very good.	Ancha, ancha allinmi kani.

He does it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwan.
He couldn't get out.	Payqa manam lluqsiyta atirqachu.
He probably didn't want to leave.	Payqa manapaschá ripuyta munarqanchu.
He tends to walk faster in the summer.	Payqa chiri killapi aswan utqaylla puriyta munan.
It never seemed like a good day.	Manam haykapipas allin punchaw hinachu karqa.
No, really scared.	Manan, cheqaqtapuni mancharisqa.

I’m sorry that.	Llakikuni chay.
But nobody does that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I think it would have been good.	Yuyaykuni allin kanman karqan.
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa.
I couldn’t let that happen.	Manam chay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
So, he asked me.	Chaymi, nispas tapuwarqa.
Please tell me what happened.	Ama hina kaspa willaway imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He would have been married earlier.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi casarasqa kanman karqa.
We are better than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanchik.

Of course that’s not good enough.	Chiqamanta chay mana allinchu.
I’m okay with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi kachkani.
To the great house.	Hatun wasiman.
He didn't know what to do with it all.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu tukuy chaywan ima ruwananta.

You’re a human being.	Runa kanki.

It’s a good thing to do.	Allinmi chay ruwayqa.
But if he is a black man.	Ichaqa yana runa kaptinqa.
He doesn’t know anything.	Payqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
She didn't know what he meant.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima niy munasqanmanta.
It was really hard.	Chiqaptam sasa karqa.

This was crazy.	Kayqa loco hinam karqa.

He quickly left with her.	Payqa usqhayllan paywan ripurqan.
This is being you and being safe.	Kayqa qam kaymi hinaspa seguro kaymi.
It’s not easy.	Manam facilchu.
This process is very simple.	Kay ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
A good house.	Huk allin wasi.
I was fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi karqani.
He will probably be happy.	Yaqapaschá payqa kusisqa kanqa.
I don’t want to go crazy.	Manam loco kayta munanichu.
This seems about right.	Kayqa yaqa allinmi rikchakun.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
No one knows why.	Manan pipas yachanchu imarayku chayta.
Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas hatunmi karqa.
Don’t be a negative thinker.	Ama mana allin yuyayniyuq kaychu.
And then he came out.	Hinaspa chaymanta lluqsirqa.
Don't be such a child.	Ama chayna wawa kaychu.
So thanks for this.	Chaymi kaymanta gracias.
And the worst part is.	Hinaspa aswan mana allinqa.
Maybe nothing could.	Ichapas mana imapas atirqachu.
In fact, maybe really.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas chiqaptapuni.
So no one is here.	Chaymi mana pipas kaypichu kachkan.
People were outraged.	Runakunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
The best you can do.	Allinta ruway atisqaykita.
I wish it were the case.	Munaymanmi chayna kananta.
I don’t know how to do this.	Manam yachanichu kayta ruwayta.

Fortunately, it does just that.	Ancha kusisqa, chaylla chayta ruwan.
Really, really me.	Chiqap, chiqap ñuqa.
Yes, he speaks well.	Arí, payqa allintam riman.
Really, thank you.	Chiqamanta, gracias.

Now you know what you are.	Kunanmi yachanki imayna kasqaykita.

I'm not sure there's anything else.	Manam segurochu kani huk imapas kasqanmanta.
He meant to say.	Niyta munarqa.
I don’t really want to travel more time.	Manam anchatachu munani aswan pacha puriyta.
It had to be quick.	Chayqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
You can never tell.	Manan hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
It may not be ideal, but it is there.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
Who knows, maybe it works.	Pi yachan, ichapas allin kanman.
I didn’t think about it.	Manam piensarqanichu.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Mana allin kaptinqa manam mana allinqa kanchu.
I didn’t mean that in a bad way.	Manam mana allintachu chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
The last step was useless.	Qhipa ruwayqa mana imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
You are the one who is not.	Qamqa kanki chay mana kaq.
I had an idea.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
In the real world.	Chiqap pachapi.
I didn’t know when you would be.	Manam yacharqanichu haykapi kanki.
I couldn’t be like that.	Manam atirqanichu chayna kanaypaq.
Happy few people.	Kusisqa pisi runakuna.
He died later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Nothing can be easy.	Manan imapas facilchu kanman.
A while.	Huk tiempo.
Even so, it was a foolish move.	Chayna kaptinpas, mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqa.
She kept something from him.	Payqa imatapas paymanta pakasqa.
I couldn’t walk around.	Manam puriyta atirqanichu.
I'm going to go home.	Wasiyman risaq.
Anyway, thank you.	Imayna kaptinpas, gracias.
That’s a lot.	Chayqa ancha.
The result is beautiful indeed.	Chay ruwasqanqa sumaqmi cheqaqtapuni.
Wrong the first time.	Ñawpaq kutipi pantasqa.
He found himself eager to get the chance.	Payqa tarikurqa anchatam chay oportunidadta tariyta munarqa.
He can’t see it.	Mana rikuyta atinchu.
I knew that a long time ago.	Chaytaqa unayñam yacharqani.
I just want to answer.	Chaylla kutichiyta munani.
Something needs to be done about this.	Kaymantaqa imatapas ruwana.
This was the first one.	Kaymi ñawpaq kaq karqa.
He did it in a very remarkable way.	Chaytaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi ruwarqa.
He was always good to me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq allin karqa.
However, this approach is extremely uncomfortable.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa sinchi mana allinchu.
I am doing it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwachkani.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chaywan.
It doesn’t seem to do this though.	Manan kayta ruwanman hinachu ichaqa.
Many, many, more.	Achka, achka, aswan.
But it was not in time.	Ichaqa manan tiempollanpichu karqan.
He didn't notice her.	Payqa manan repararqanchu paytaqa.
He seemed happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
Hopefully it would have been good.	Munaymanmi allin kanman karqan.
But he is not the best.	Ichaqa manan payqa aswan allinchu.
It has to be really big.	Chiqap hatunmi kanan.
I didn’t want to go with him.	Manam munarqanichu paywan riyta.
He used to live here, but no longer.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim tiyaq, ichaqa manañam.
He knew he couldn’t win.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana atipayta atisqanmanta.
No one seems to know why.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imarayku kasqanmantaqa.
Make it work for you.	Allin kananpaq ruway.
This was supposed to be a good day.	Kay punchawqa allinmi kanan karqa.
That’s all.	Chaylla.
This was not a good thing to do.	Kay ruwayqa mana allinchu karqa.
Maybe that’s not the best way to do it.	Ichapas mana chay ruwayqa aswan allinchu kanman.
He was probably right.	Payqa yaqapaschá allinta rimarqan.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
He was everything he wanted.	Payqa tukuy ima munasqanman hinam karqa.
People were very serious.	Runakunaqa ancha serio karqanku.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
And.	Chaymanta.
That doesn’t make any sense.	Chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
The ugly, terrible truth.	Chay millay, manchay chiqap.
Something was good.	Imapas allinmi karqa.
He knew better than that.	Payqa aswan allintan yacharqan.
That’s how you do it.	Chaynatam ruwanki.
Everyone was happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa karqaku.
It was a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I don't feel comfortable with that.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu sientekuni.
And all this stuff can wait.	Hinaspa tukuy kay imakuna suyayta atin.
I hope he does.	Suyachkani chayta ruwananta.
I listened to it a lot.	Anchatam uyarirqani.
He didn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
I don't think that's the case.	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
But that was a big deal.	Ichaqa chayqa hatunmi karqan.
I just can’t help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atinichu.
I wanted to know how he got away with it.	Imaynatataq chaymanta lluqsirqa chayta yachayta munarqani.
He doesn’t know much about the problem.	Payqa manas anchatachu yachan chay sasachakuymanta.
The only thing that’s right.	Chaylla kaq.
That is not the case here.	Chayqa manan kaypiqa hinachu.
He looks really bad, you know.	Payqa chiqap mana allinmi rikchakun, yachanki.
You know it's true.	Yachankim chiqap kasqanmanta.
This guy is a guy.	Kay runaqa.
It can't be that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kanman.
They don’t really know what’s going on.	Paykunaqa manan allintachu yachanku imachus pasashasqanmanta.
You are a busy man.	Ocupasqa runam kanki.
That’s what black does.	Chaytan yana ruwan.
But he knew what he had to do.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
I've never heard anything like it.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa uyarirqanichu.
He was very angry about it.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa chaymanta.
That was not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.
Here the bigger means the better.	Kaypiqa aswan hatun kaptinqa aswan allinmi niyta munan.
It seems funny that that means nothing to him.	Asikunapaq hinam rikchakun chay mana imatapas paypaq nisqanmanta.
A month, maybe.	Huk killa, ichapas.
Nothing in there.	Mana imapas chaypiqa.
But of course it would.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanman.
Not sure how that happened.	Mana segurochu imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima ruwasqanmanta.
That was pretty easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
Seriously, he did a great job with me.	Serio, payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa ñuqawan.
Eventually they become friends.	Qhepamanmi amigontin kanku.
I just thought it was so funny.	Chayllam ancha asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta piensarqani.
If you don’t want to go.	Mana riyta munaspaqa.
It will do very well.	Ancha allintam ruwanqa.
He really wanted to leave.	Payqa anchatan munarqan ripuyta.
That was a process.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi karqa.
I just did that recently.	Chayllaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqani.
It would have been easier that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi kanman karqan.
So he went away.	Chaymi rirqa.
Looks like it won't be enough.	Mana chayllachu kanqa hinam rikchakun.
What did he say?	¿Imatataq nirqa?
I can't take this.	Kaytaqa manam hapiyta atiymanchu.
He knows why.	Payqa yachanmi imanasqa chayta.
But this seemed reasonable.	Ichaqa kayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
Even if that pipe is me.	Chay pipas ñuqa kaptinpas.
Now then.	Kunan chaymanta.
But you can never be too sure.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas nishuta seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
He had to go to that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi rinan karqa.
Really nice guy.	Chiqamanta sumaq runa.
If you do, you won’t be.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, manan chay hinachu kanki.
This was something more.	Kayqa aswan imapas karqa.
I was intelligent.	Ñuqaqa yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
Most of this is just set time though.	Yaqa llapan kayqa chaylla churasqa pacha ichaqa.
I thought about it.	Chaypin yuyaykurqani.
It’s not very good.	Mana ancha allinchu.
Here.	Kaypi.
So he wanted to be a bad guy.	Chaymi mana allin runa kayta munarqa.
There are	Kan
I can’t tell you now.	Mana kunan willayta atiymanchu.
At all the right times.	Tukuy allin tiempopi.

But not everything seems to be going well.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas allinchu kanman hinaqa.
It wasn’t like that.	Mana chay hinachu karqan.
He didn’t really do anything to find out.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas ruwarqan chayta yachananpaq.
We’re caught.	Hap’isqa kayku.
I want to be sure.	Seguro kayta munani.
Here is the thing.	Kaypim kachkan chay imapas.
That was the man.	Chay runam kasqa.
You probably want to know.	Yaqapaschá yachayta munanki.
And .	Chaymanta .
It’s actually pretty interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I never saw him before.	Manam haykapipas paytaqa rikurqanichu.
I don’t remember him.	Manam paytaqa yuyarinichu.
I was a little crazy.	Huk chikan loco karqani.
This is a new day.	Kayqa musuq punchawmi.
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
He knows the way.	Payqa ñanta yachan.
I’m not really sure.	Manam chiqaptachu seguro kani.
I couldn’t say what happened next.	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan niyta atirqanichu.
It was a wonderful night.	Chayqa ancha sumaq tutam karqa.
He knew that he had agreed to it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruwayman arí nisqanmanta.
In almost everything.	Yaqa tukuy imapipas.
This is a very good practice.	Kayqa ancha allin ruwaymi.
It’s very fast.	Ancha utqayllam.
One, two, three.	Huk, iskay, kimsa.
He is no longer available.	Kunanqa manañam kanchu.
You can’t do it.	Qamqa manam atiwaqchu.
Something went wrong.	Imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
It sounds very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi uyarikun.
Instead, it’s.	Aswanpas.
Experts disagree as to why.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa manam acuerdopichu kanku imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
He couldn't speak.	Payqa manam rimayta atirqachu.
If yes, do nothing.	Arí kaptinqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
I wish it was here.	Munaymanmi kaypi kananta.
That’s where you want to be.	Chayqa maypichus kayta munanki.
So it’s very real.	Chaymi ancha chiqap.
This is the one.	Kaymi huk.
Sometimes sad.	Wakin kuti llakisqa.
Everyone was busy.	Lliwmi ocupasqa karqaku.
Otherwise, it’s not bad.	Mana chayqa, mana mana allinchu.
About a month ago, now.	Yaqa huk killa ñawpaqta, kunan.
So far everything seems fine.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
I didn’t know what it was.	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
This will be faster.	Kayqa aswan utqayllam kanqa.
He can do two, three years.	Payqa iskay, kimsa wata ruwayta atin.
He can't get out of here.	Payqa manam kaymantaqa lluqsiyta atinchu.
Is there anything you can do about it?	¿Kanchu chaymanta imatapas ruwanaykipaq?
He should be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanan.
Everything was bad.	Mana allinmi karqa tukuy imapas.
According to his will.	Munasqanman hina.
Maybe, maybe more.	Ichapas, ichapas aswan achka.
I cannot stand this.	Kaytaqa manam aguantayta atinichu.
That’s a human being.	Chayqa runam.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
She felt very sad and lonely.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinaspa sapallanmi tarikurqa.
This does not exist, and perhaps never will.	Kayqa manam kanchu, ichapas mana haykapipas kanqachu.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
So here was the thing.	Chaymi kaypi karqa chay imapas.
You mean it.	Niyta munanki.
I can’t find it.	Manam tariyta atiymanchu.
Nothing was ever right.	Manam imapas haykapipas allinchu karqa.
We did not react immediately.	Chayna kaptinqa manam chayllachu imatapas ruwarqayku.
It was a very sad experience.	Chayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqan.
There was no such person.	Chayna runaqa manam karqachu.
Repeat the whole process.	Tukuy ruwayta yapamanta ruway.
And then he did it.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ruwarqa.
I want to know who did it.	Pikuna ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I have no idea what the problem could be.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima sasachakuy kanman chayta.
That was more of a learning process.	Chayqa aswan yachay ruwaymi karqan.
I know who this is.	Yachanim pi kayqa kasqanmanta.
He is the best in everything.	Payqa tukuy imapipas aswan allinmi.
I want you to join me.	Munaymanmi ñoqawan kuska kanaykita.
So he said it anyway.	Chaymi imayna kaptinpas nirqa.
It is always somewhere.	Maypipas sapa kutim kachkan.
I would like you to do that.	Munaymanmi chayta ruwanaykita.
That’s the whole truth.	Chayqa llapan cheqaq kaqmi.
He knows that.	Chaytaqa yachanmi.
That was very difficult for me.	Chayqa anchatam sasa karqa ñuqapaq.
This wasn’t the case before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan kay hinachu karqan.
And then he was gone.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manaña karqachu.
But I was fine.	Ichaqa allinmi karqani.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu chayqa.
Does it really look like that?	¿Cheqaqtachu chay hina rikch’akun?
He wasn’t supposed to be there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kanan karqan.
That’s what it’s always been.	Chayqa hayk’aqpas karqan.
He was usually successful.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim allinta ruwaq.
I’ll probably agree with you.	Yaqapaschá qanwan acuerdopi kasaq.
I couldn’t see it.	Manam rikuyta atirqanichu.
So far, no one has been able to.	Kunankamaqa manam pipas atinmanchu.
Will go there again this year.	Kay wata yapamanta chayman rinqa.
He had done it twice before.	Ñawpaqtaqa iskay kutitan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
It’s okay to want to do that.	Chayta ruwayta munaspaqa allinmi.
He was home alone with her.	Payqa sapallanmi paywan kuska wasipi kasharqan.
I never, ever thought you would.	Manam haykapipas, mana haykapipas piensarqanichu chayta ruwanaykipaqqa.
Have a nice day!	Qampaq allin punchaw!
I can barely hear that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá uyarini.
He said he wanted me to have a party.	Payqa nirqam huk fiestata ruwanaypaq munasqanmanta.
His next move was very difficult.	Qatiqnin ruwasqanqa ancha sasam karqa.
I'm sure there's nothing there.	Seguro kani chaypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
More, more about me.	Aswan, aswan ñuqamanta.
Say what you want to say.	Niy munasqaykita.
I feel like a child.	Wawa hinam tarikuni.
It couldn’t be easier!.	¡Manan aswan facilchu kanman!.
The first is the best.	Ñawpaq kaq allin kaq.
That’s what I wanted.	Chaynatam munarqani.
Three first-name characters.	Kimsa ñawpaq sutiyuq runa.
Here’s what I have.	Kaypim ñuqapa kachkan.
He must act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan.
That’s all I mean.	Chaylla niyta munani.
He can’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
Such a beautiful house.	Chayna sumaq wasi.
But maybe it’s the truth.	Ichaqa ichapas cheqaq kaq kanman.
And then it’s.	Hinaspa chaymanta.
He wanted to wait.	Payqa suyayta munarqa.
He is, in fact.	Payqa, chiqaptaqa.
He had been there a long time.	Payqa unayñan chaypi kasharqan.
They want to be fast.	Paykunaqa utqaylla kayta munanku.
We cannot take this.	Kaytaqa manam hapiyta atichwanchu.
How.	Imayna.
This is a new type of tea.	Kayqa musuq laya chay.
Now there is probably someone else living in this city.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá huk runa kay llaqtapi tiyan.
He couldn't figure out how.	Mana imayna kasqanmanta yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
Again it was him.	Yapamanta paymi karqa.
He could do well.	Payqa allintam ruwayta atinman karqa.
We lived there for no reason.	Mana imaraykupas chaypi tiyaq kayku.
Surprisingly,	Admirakuypaqmi, .
Now it’s worse.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
I’m the guy.	Ñuqam chay runa kani.
If not today, then tomorrow, that's all.	Mana kunan punchawchu chayqa, paqarin, chaylla.
But again, that will take time.	Ichaqa yapamanta, chaypaqqa tiempon kanqa.
I feel very proud.	Ancha orgulloso sientekuni.
That went well, but then not so well.	Chayqa allintam rirqa, ichaqa chaymantaqa manam chayna allinchu.
Like a world.	Huk pacha hina.
All the same, he couldn’t.	Tukuy chayna, mana atirqachu.
That’s if you want him.	Chayqa sichus payta munanki chayqa.
It’s really there.	Chiqamanta chaypi kachkan.
So far, nothing.	Kunankamaqa, mana imapas.
I am much happier about this.	Kaymantaqa aswan kusisqam kachkani.
Here is an easy thing you can do.	Kaypi huk facil ruwaymi kachkan, chaytam ruwawaq.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam imapaqpas allinchu.
There is nothing he can do.	Mana ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
He does this every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaytaqa ruwan.
You just found out.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqanki.
It depends on the weather.	Chayqa kanqa ima tiempopi kasqanmantam.
The man was crazy.	Chay runaqa loco kasqa.
Know where they are.	Maypi kasqankuta yachay.
No one is very happy.	Mana pipas ancha kusisqachu.
That was obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
I know what you want.	Yachanim ima munasqaykita.
And what do you do.	Hinaspa ima ruway.
But he knew what he had to do.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
But it would take some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempon kanan karqan.
He said he couldn't help it.	Paymi nirqa mana yanapayta atisqanmanta.
And this should be easy.	Hinaspa kayqa facilmi kanan.
It wasn’t like that anymore.	Manañan chay hinachu karqan.
Or, maybe, ever.	Utaq, ichapas, haykapipas.
I was like I was.	Ñuqaqa hinam karqani.
In most cases.	Yaqa llapanpim.
That’s a stranger.	Chayqa mana riqsisqa runam.
That had to go.	Chayqa rinan karqan.
I made a game.	Huk pukllayta ruwarqani.
I can’t believe they aren’t more popular.	Mana creeyta atiymanchu mana aswan riqsisqa kasqankuta.
That’s a difficult task.	Chaypaqqa sasa ruwaymi.
Better than this.	Aswan allin kaymanta.
I hope you enjoy it.	Suyachkani kusisqa kanaykita.
Still, he was happy.	Chayna kaptinpas kusisqam tarikurqa.
Someone was there.	Pipas kasqa.
They want to be happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqa kaytam munanku.
This is what it should be.	Kaymi kanan.
That’s a good idea.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
And he wasn’t alone, this guy.	Hinaspa mana sapallanchu kasqa, kay wayna.
He didn’t do everything right.	Payqa manam tukuy imatapas allintachu ruwarqa.
She refuses to talk about her feelings.	Payqa manan munanchu imayna sientekusqanmanta rimayta.
He can barely handle it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa hap’iyta atin.
He said he didn't remember.	Payqa manam yuyarinichu nispa.
He was there before.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaypim karqa.
Perhaps he thought so.	Yaqapaschá chayta yuyaykurqan.
One of the most numerous.	Huknin aswan achka.
He looked at it.	Chayta qhawarisqa.
Perhaps you are.	Yaqapaschá qamqa kanki.
I really, really, hope so .	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, chayta suyachkani .
Someone else does it for you.	Huk runam qampaq chayta ruwan.
That’s a good thing for me.	Chayqa allinmi ñuqapaq.
He was the one who received the most attention.	Paymi aswan allinta qhawarisqa karqan.
Go.	Riy.
Being a good teacher is essential.	Allin yachachiq kayqa ancha allinmi.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allin runam karqa.
He can barely wait.	Payqa yaqapaschá suyayta atin.
But don't forget.	Ama qunqaychu.
I didn’t want to go.	Manam riyta munarqanichu.
He was going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi kasharqan.
I want to help you.	Yanapayta munani.
Very, very ugly.	Ancha, ancha millay.
I just couldn’t believe it could be so beautiful.	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu chayna sumaq kayta atisqanmanta.
But it’s later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi.
Then great again.	Chaymanta hatun yapamanta.
He wasn’t happy or unhappy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu nitaq mana kusisqachu kasqa.
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwasqanqa allinchu karqan.
No way, no way.	Mana imayna, mana imayna.
Not the first time.	Mana ñawpaq kutichu.
But it’s not that bad.	Ichaqa manan chay hina mana allinchu.
So it was difficult.	Chaymi sasa karqa.
He realized that he could not tell her where he was.	Payqa repararqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta mana willayta atisqanmanta.
I don't know anything about it really.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu chiqaptaqa.
First of all the last one.	Ñawpaqtaqa qhipa kaq.
It happened very quickly.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
He doesn’t want to do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta munanchu.
I am still the same person.	Kunankamapas chayna runam kani.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
This is what he does.	Kaytam payqa ruwan.
And actually, it’s really nice.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, chiqap sumaqmi.
We have no idea where he was that day.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanchik maypi chay punchaw kasqanmantaqa.
It was a no-brainer.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan munanchu chayta ruwayta.
I wanted to tell you something.	Imatapas willayta munarqani.
It will be a strong one.	Sinchi kaqmi kanqa.
Don’t forget who you are.	Ama qunqaychu pi kasqaykita.
He is doing very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
I thought he would come back.	Yuyarqanim kutimunanta.
It will be good for you.	Allinmi kanqa qampaq.
That's right, there's something wrong with that.	Chayqa, chaypiqa imapas mana allinmi kachkan.
Difficult world, actually.	Sasa pacha, chiqaptaqa.
Nothing but this is it.	Mana imapas aswanpas kaymi.
Maybe you did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqanki.
Everybody wants that.	Lliwmi chaytaqa munanku.
It was the same as before.	Ñawpaqpi kaq hinallam karqa.
That happened here.	Chayqa kaypim pasarqa.
That was obviously not true.	Chay nisqanqa sut’inmi mana cheqaqchu karqan.
There was a man here.	Kaypi huk runa kasqa.
But it was easy.	Ichaqa facilmi karqa.
I really won't do that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
There is nothing like a house.	Wasi hinaqa manam kanchu.
I don’t remember it.	Manam yuyarinichu.
Nothing and everything.	Mana imapas hinaspa tukuy ima.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Payqa manam chiqaptachu chaymanta rimayta munarqa.
I’m not the only one.	Manam ñuqallachu kani.
It’s not something you have to do every day.	Manan sapa p’unchay ruwanayki hinachu.
It really wasn't a big deal.	Chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu karqa.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Chaylla mana yachanichu kaymanta mayman riyta.
He said it was useless.	Payqa nirqam mana imapaqpas kasqanmanta.
It would be easier.	Aswan facilmi kanman.
Seriously, the worst.	Serio, aswan mana allin kaq.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manan kanchu.
It didn’t take long.	Mana unaytachu ruwarqa.
I don’t want it to be me.	Manam munanichu ñuqa kananta.
But that’s not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu.
I don’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu.
Or there it is.	Utaq chaypi.
This was the first one.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqa.
He knows that to be true.	Payqa yachanmi chay cheqaq kasqanmanta.
All right, he says.	Allinmi, nispas nin.
What are you doing tonight?	¿Imatataq kunan tuta ruwachkanki?
I want to do it.	Ñoqaqa ruwayta munani.
I feel exhausted.	Sayk’usqa hinan sientekuni.
I wanted to talk to you.	Qanwan rimayta munarqani.
Very good '.	Aswan allinmi '.
I’ve heard about this.	Kaymantaqa uyarirqanim.
The house is very large.	Wasi ancha hatun.
So he doesn’t.	Chaymi payqa mana.
I was very uncomfortable.	Ancha mana allinchu karqani.
I know how this is, though.	Yachanim kay imayna kasqanmanta, ichaqa.
I couldn’t even do that.	Manam chayta ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Everything considered.	Tukuy imapas qhawarisqa.
He knows things are good.	Payqa yachanmi imapas allin kasqanmanta.
Perhaps it should have been.	Ichapas chayna kanan karqa.
He came later.	Payqa qhepamanmi hamurqan.
Be good or you’ll be next.	Allin kay icha qatiqnin kanki.
But probably not.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana.
It will be later.	Qhepamanmi kanqa.
It’s a great achievement.	Hatun ruwaymi.
I am sure you will succeed!.	¡Seguro kani allinta ruwanaykipaq!.
And he’s black.	Hinaspa payqa yana.
But it’s still that.	Ichaqa chayraqmi.
I think he is gone.	Payqa manaña kasqanmantam piensani.
But there is nothing he can do.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
He's been here a long time.	Payqa unayñam kaypi kachkan.
But I don’t think you should.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykunichu chayta ruwanaykipaq.
The same thing.	Kikin imapas.
They are not the only ones.	Paykunaqa manan chayllachu kanku.
Now, about why you are here.	Kunanqa, imarayku kaypi kachkanki chaymanta.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan.
They were infuriated by it.	Chaywanmi phiñasqa karqanku.
I really can’t understand what happened.	Chiqamanta mana entiendeyta atinichu imachus pasasqanmanta.
They were disappointed and frustrated.	Paykunaqa hukmanyasqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa karqaku.
That’s the kind of person he is.	Chayqa chayna runam.
He’s not too happy, but it’s okay.	Payqa manan ancha kusisqachu, ichaqa manan imapas kanchu.
I don’t want to be this.	Manam kayta munanichu.
But it’s no big deal.	Ichaqa manan hatun ruwaychu.
I knew that was you.	Yacharqanim chayqa qam kasqaykita.
He never made a big deal of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas hatun ruwaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It’s more like it.	Aswan rikchakun.
It was about a few years ago.	Yaqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chayna karqa.
You think you know what you want.	Munasqaykita yachasqaykita yuyanki.
I’m not the only one.	Ñuqaqa manam chayllachu.
They were very lucky.	Paykunaqa ancha suerteyoqmi karqanku.
I didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
Maybe you knew it.	Ichapas yacharqanki.
At home.	Wasipi.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I want to say a few things.	Iskay kimsa rimayta munani.
I'm black.	Yana kani.
Maybe a few years.	Ichapas iskay kimsa wata.
It’s an unknown thing.	Mana riqsisqa kaqmi.
He left the city.	Chay llaqtamanta ripurqan.
The first one is not.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana.
He didn’t think he would.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwananta.
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
He couldn't say anything else.	Manam hukta rimayta atirqachu.
I know this is a bad thing to do but anyway.	Yachanim kayqa mana allin ruway kasqanmanta ichaqa imayna kaptinpas.
That was pretty amazing, actually.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
He wanted to do this right.	Payqa kayta allinta ruwayta munarqa.
He could never tell her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa willayta atirqanchu.
It was a very great day.	Ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
But two things.	Ichaqa iskay imakuna.
I don't think so.	Manam chaytaqa piensanichu.
There’s no knowing what could happen.	Mana yachay kanchu imachus kanman chayta.
but actually, it was a good day.	ichaqa chiqaptaqa, allin punchawmi karqa.
No, it was a long time after that.	Manan, chaymantaqa unayñan karqan.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan ruwarqan.
I’m sure that time will pass quickly.	Seguro kani chay tiempo usqhaylla pasananta.
It was amazing to be there.	Admirakuypaqmi karqa chaypi kayqa.
Yes, this is it.	Arí, kaymi.
No one knows what it is.	Manam pipas yachanchu.
And it’s more than ready.	Hinaspa aswan listoña.
I’m right there.	Chaypim kachkani.
I didn’t know who they were.	Manam yacharqanichu pikuna kasqankuta.
If it’s not for me.	Mana ñuqapaq kaptinqa.
For the most part, they were.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna karqaku.
And who knows, maybe it will.	Hinaspa pi yachan, ichapas chayna kanman.
It was a very cold day.	Ancha chiri punchawmi karqa.
There is one of them.	Hukninmi kachkan.
But at least.	Ichaqa aswanpas.
Do better in school today.	Kunan punchaw yachay wasipi aswan allinta ruway.
Very easy to communicate with him.	Ancha facilmi paywan rimayqa.
There is nothing without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam imapas kanchu.
Tell her everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispa niy.
That is a bad thing to do.	Chayna ruwayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
It won’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanqa.
I couldn’t believe it.	Mana creeyta atirqanichu.
This is not a very good thing.	Kayqa manam ancha allinchu.
So, it’s very interesting.	Chaymi, ancha sumaq.
It was a very early one.	Ancha ñawpaq kaqmi karqa.
It would be a good idea for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi kanman.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Payqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
It’s beautiful!	¡Sumaqmi!
What does it look like?	¿Imaynataq rikchakun?
Why should I? 	¿Imaraykutaq ñuqa?
I felt ugly and angry.	Millay millay hinaspa phiñasqa tarikurqani.
He doesn’t do it anymore.	Manañan ruwanchu.
It meant a lot.	Anchatam niyta munarqa.
You’ll be there for three days.	Kimsa punchawmi kanki.
If it’s not bad.	Mana mana allin kaptinqa.
Do it for real this time.	Kay kutipi chiqaptapuni ruway.
Something is wrong there.	Chaypiqa imapas mana allinmi kachkan.
That’s a big one.	Chay hatunmi.
This was some time ago.	Kayqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
Wouldn’t want it any other way.	Mana huk hinata munanmanchu.
I like the people here.	Kaypi runakunaqa gustan.
We did it right.	Allintam ruwarqayku.
Now he had to do it.	Kunanqa ruwanan karqan.
Maybe it’s familiar.	Ichapas riqsisqa kachkan.
Now, what is it? 	Kunanqa, ¿imataq?
It was a human being.	Chayqa runam karqa.
This was the good thing.	Kaymi allin kaq karqa.
A year ago.	Huk wata ñawpaqta.
He has been in prison for two years.	Payqa iskay watañam carcelpi kachkan.
He’ll be happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kanqa.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Manam hatun ruway kananpaqchu piensarqani.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atiymanchu.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
I felt happy today.	Kunan punchawmi kusisqa tarikurqani.
He does this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwan.
And they were.	Hinan paykunaqa karqanku.
More than anything else.	Imamantapas astawan.
You’re a man, too.	Qampas runa.
Tell me, tell me.	Willaway, willaway.
And the other one.	Hinaspa huknin.
I don't think it's there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypi kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Paqarinmi aswan allin kayta munani.
I’m glad he’s nice to her.	Kusikuni paywan sumaq kasqanmanta.
He left a few days ago.	Payqa iskay kinsa p’unchay ñawpaqtaraqmi ripurqan.
So, you know, there it is.	Chaymi, yachanki, chaypim kachkan.
He was the most intelligent man of his day.	Payqa karqan chay tiempopi aswan yachaysapa runa.
But it’s too big.	Ichaqa sinchi hatunmi.
And now he looks less, for some reason.	Hinaspa kunanqa aswan pisi rikchayniyuq, imapaqpas.
There will be a second one.	Iskay kaqmi kanqa.
I've got this.	Kayta hap'ini.
I was probably there.	Yaqapaschá chaypiqa karqani.
I don’t seem to have much time.	Manapaschá ancha tiempoy kanchu.
She looked sad.	Payqa llakisqa qhawarisqa.
And really, wouldn’t it?.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni, ¿manachu chayna kanman?.
So that’s what we did.	Chaymi chayta ruwarqayku.
I think he is.	Payqa chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
And, of course,.	Hinaspa, sut’inmi,.
I have no idea how to do that.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynata chayta ruwanaypaq.
He said he could do it himself.	Paymi nirqa pay kikin ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I really wasn't sure if that was right or wrong.	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqani chay allin kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta.
We can’t say yes to it.	Manam arí niyta atichwanchu.
He said everything was fine at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa tukuy imapas allinmi nirqan.
I couldn’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu.
No one knows how to fix it.	Manan pipas yachanchu imayna allichayta.
Yes.	Arí.
They were too fast.	Paykunaqa llumpay utqayllam karqaku.
Was more worried about you.	Aswan llakisqa karqan qanmanta.
And no more.	Hinaspa manaña.
They were very nice.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku.
You’re a fool.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
No one knows what happened there.	Chaypi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
Please do not do such things here.	Ama hina kaspa, ama kaypi chay hina ruwaykunata ruwaychu.
I can’t get to it.	Manam chayayta atiymanchu.
Everything was fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
There really isn’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam kanchu.
But that was later.	Ichaqa chayqa qhepamanmi karqan.
I want to hear from him.	Paymanta uyariyta munani.
I was a human being.	Ñuqaqa runam karqani.
Plus, that doesn’t.	Astawan, chay mana.
I'm sure you're tired.	Seguro kani sayk'usqa kasqaykita.
I was there, too.	Ñuqapas karqani.
It didn't work out very well.	Manam ancha allintachu lluqsirqa.
I know this is the case.	Kaytaqa yachanin.
But there is more.	Ichaqa aswanpas kanmi.
He is one of the main characters.	Paymi huknin hatun runa.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Ichapas rimayta munan.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Like last time.	Qhipa kutipi hina.
I want to hear more.	Astawan uyariyta munani.
But not as bad as you, man.	Ichaqa manan qan hinachu millay, runa.
I won’t do it.	Manam ruwasaqchu.
That was a bad guy.	Chayqa millay runam karqa.
So I'm not sure what he's doing.	Chaymi mana segurochu kani ima ruwasqanmanta.
I saw it today.	Kunan punchawmi rikurqani.
What did he just say?	¿Imatataq chayllaraq nirqa?
I’m looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa suyachkani.
That would have been crazy.	Chayqa loco kaymi kanman karqan.
I mean, it’s fine.	Niyta munani, allinmi.
He knew something, but he didn't know exactly what it was.	Payqa imatapas yacharqanmi, ichaqa manan allintachu yacharqan imachus kasqanmanta.
You’ll be there, too.	Qampas kanqa.
But now there is no time.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan tiempo kanchu.
Again, not so good.	Yapamanta, mana chayna allinchu.
The process of doing so is relatively easy.	Chayta ruwanapaq ruwayqa aswan facilmi.
Nothing more than that.	Mana imapas aswanpas chaylla.
He thought this was a good thing.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kayqa allin kananpaq.
Obviously this is not true.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
But you can do it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwawaq.
Everything seemed to be there.	Tukuy imapas kanan hinam karqa.
People know that.	Runakunaqa chaytam yachanku.
It was a very cold day.	Chay punchawmi sinchi chiri karqa.
But ask him to do something more.	Ichaqa niy imatapas astawan ruwananpaq.
So who knows.	Chaymi pi yachan.
He probably won’t.	Yaqapaschá mana chayta ruwanqachu.
I loved it so much.	Anchatam munarqani.
But this was good for him.	Ichaqa kaymi paypaq allin karqa.
It will be three days.	Kimsa punchawmi kanqa.
Before anyone you then.	Manaraq pitapas qan chaymanta.
I know that means a lot to you.	Yachanim chayqa qampaq ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Beautiful thing.	Sumaq imapas.
I can’t be the only one.	Manam ñuqallachu chaytaqa ruwayman.
Maybe he’s busy.	Ichapas payqa ocupasqa kachkan.
Now do something about it.	Kunanqa imatapas ruway.
The real action is at night.	Chiqap ruwayqa tutam.
I’m a teacher.	Yachachiqmi kani.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
Do this more often.	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kuti ruway.
I know it's in there somewhere.	Yachanim maypipas chaypi kasqanmanta.
He looked great now.	Payqa kunanqa hatunmi rikchakurqa.
I was there for a while.	Huk tiempon chaypi karqani.
I mean, he says very sadly.	Niyta munani, ancha llakisqa nin.
He didn’t seem upset.	Payqa manan phiñasqa hinachu kasqa.
I never went there today.	Manam haykapipas kunan punchawqa chaymanqa rirqanichu.
I don't think I like it very much.	Manam anchatachu gustan nispam piensani.
Looked at again.	Hukmanta qhawarisqa.
It’s pretty clear what you need to do.	Allin sut’inmi ima ruwanayki kasqanmanta.
Very good indeed.	Ancha allin chiqap.
Nobody likes him.	Manan pipas paytaqa gustanchu.
I was so excited about it.	Ñuqaqa ancha kusisqam karqani.
There will be one.	Hukninmi kanqa.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
No, the other one doesn’t.	Manan, hukninmi mana.
I’ve been there recently.	Chayllaraqmi chaypiqa karqani.
She said thank you.	Payqa gracias nispas nisqa.
That’s what it does.	Chayqa ruwan.
So dark, so cold, so scared.	Ancha yana, ancha chiri, ancha mancharisqa.
But, really, it's not good.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa, manam allinchu.
But don't do anything.	Ichaqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
Tonight was his night.	Kunan tutaqa tutan karqan.
That was obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan.
And then maybe not.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manapaschá.
Now he was angry.	Kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.
You’re easy.	Facilmi kanki.
This is tough stuff.	Kayqa sinchi imapas.
It’s that simple.	Chayqa chay hina facilmi.
This did two things.	Chayqa iskay ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
I, it’s okay.	Ñuqa, allinmi.
But he wanted to.	Ichaqa munarqanmi.
Yeah, if that’s all.	Arí, sichus chaylla.
I don’t really know what happened.	Manam allintachu yachani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I don’t want to talk anymore.	Manañam rimayta munanichu.
The next morning, an afternoon.	Huknin tutamanta, huk tarde.
He is the one.	Payqa kanmi.
He will do very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwanqa.
Again, this is good.	Yapamanta, kayqa allinmi.
It’s not like he’s unhappy.	Manan mana kusisqachu hinachu.
He couldn’t understand what had happened.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
It’s not too bad.	Mana ancha mana allinchu.
It’s pretty nice, he says.	Allin sumaqmi, nispas nin.
I was very excited about this.	Kaymantaqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqani.
That was a really big deal.	Chayqa chiqap hatun ruwaymi karqa.
Then say what you want.	Chaymanta ima munasqaykita niy.
Maybe there really was something here.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni kaypi imapas karqa.
Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna kanman.
For the first time.	Ñawpaq kutita.
It went really crazy.	Chiqamanta loco rirqa.
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
I used to talk about it there.	Chaypim chaymanta rimaq kani.
I know he is a pretty nice guy.	Yachanim payqa allin sumaq runa kasqanmanta.
The colder weather.	Aswan chiri pacha.
Then, finally, finally.	Chaymanta, tukukuypi, tukukuypi.
Three hours late.	Kimsa hora tarde.
Actually, that is not exactly true.	Chiqaptaqa chay nisqanqa manam allintachu chiqap.
He knew that was the case.	Payqa chaynatam yacharqa.
He can’t have a very good second go.	Payqa manan ancha allintachu iskay kaq kutita riyta atin.
He doesn’t want much here.	Mana anchatachu kaypi munan.
I didn’t know his first name.	Manam yacharqanichu ñawpaq sutinta.
I’m glad he’ll be there with me.	Kusikuni chaypi ñuqawan kananmanta.
Yes, it is amazing.	Arí, admirakuypaqmi.
I know it’s you.	Yachanim qam kasqaykita.
But he is not like you.	Ichaqa manan qan hinachu.
He wanted to do something.	Payqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanmi.
I want to know more about this.	Kaymanta astawan yachayta munani.
I don’t want to give that up.	Manam chaytaqa saqiyta munanichu.
You want to see what happens.	Imakuna pasananta rikuyta munanki.
But you are the first.	Ichaqa qanmi ñawpaqtaqa.
He’s very good at this.	Payqa kaypiqa ancha allinmi.
But for now, it’s you.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa, qanmi kanki.
I wish you couldn’t tell.	Munaymanmi mana willayta atisqaykita.

He wanted it gone.	Payqa munarqanmi manaña kananta.
It’s probably a good thing.	Yaqapaschá allin kanman.
Thank you very much.	Ancha kusisqa gracias.
He doesn’t act like a child.	Payqa manan wawa hinachu ruwan.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.	Manam munanichu pipas k'irisqa kananta.
I didn’t know how he could handle it.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna aguantayta atisqanmanta.
I was as surprised as you were.	Ñoqapas qan hinan admirakurqani.
I’m proud of what I did!	¡Orgulloso kani ima ruwasqaymanta!
He was deported from the country.	Paymi chay nacionmanta qarqosqa karqa.
Don’t act so surprised.	Ama chhayna admirasqa ruwaychu.
But this is the first one.	Ichaqa kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
I am the only one who can do this.	Ñuqallam kayta ruwayta atiyman.
He really wanted to be there.	Payqa anchatam chaypi kayta munarqa.
No one can leave.	Manan pipas ripuyta atinmanchu.
You don’t mean that.	Manam chaytachu niyta munanki.
He didn’t think about it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
I like to do it halfway.	Kuskan ñanta ruwayta gustan.
It’s better than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan allinmi, aswan allinmi.
Now you know it.	Kunanmi yachanki.
And that’s how it should be.	Hinaspa chayna kanan.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
There was nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas karqachu.
Maybe even if it doesn’t.	Ichapas mana kaptinpas.
It’s neither here nor there.	Manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
Otherwise you’ll be doing this all night.	Mana chayqa tukuy tutan kayta ruwanki.
It means something.	Imatapas niyta munan.
When he did, it was good.	Chayta ruwaptinqa allinmi karqa.
He would have wanted to do this, once.	Payqa kayta ruwayta munanman karqan, huk kutilla.
Why are you here?	¿Imanasqataq kaypi kachkanki?
He said nothing about how it happened.	Payqa manan imatapas nirqanchu imayna pasasqanmantaqa.
It shouldn’t be, but it should be.	Manan chay hinachu kanan, ichaqa chay hinan kanan.
I know that you know that too.	Chaytaqa yachanim qampas chayta yachanki.
They are very fast.	Paykunaqa ancha utqayllam kanku.
Nobody.	Mana pipas.
So that’s kind of interesting.	Chaymi chayqa huk laya sumaq.
But things were good.	Ichaqa imapas allinmi karqa.
I know it will take longer, yes.	Yachanim aswan unayta pasananta, arí.
He came at night.	Payqa tutan hamurqan.
I was as surprised as anyone else.	Ñuqapas huk runakuna hinam admirakurqani.
Why is it taking so long?	¿Imanasqataq chayna unayta ruwachkan?
There can be nothing wrong with that.	Chaypiqa manan imapas mana allinchu kanman.
It would have been dark.	Tuta kanman karqan.
I want to tell you about it.	Chaymanta willayta munani.
That’s all that’s here.	Chayllam kaypi kachkan.
Sounds a little cold now.	Kunanqa huk chikan chiri hinam uyarikun.
He felt sad and lonely.	Payqa llakisqa hinaspa sapallanmi tarikurqa.

He was there for the guy.	Payqa chaypim karqa.
I’m a real adult.	Chiqap kuraq runam kani.
To anyone, this seemed strange.	Pimanpas kayqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
But he refused to listen.	Ichaqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu.
That’s what he thinks.	Chaytan payqa yuyaykun.
Why, we are so happy together.	Imarayku, ancha kusisqam kuska kachkaniku.
His name is everything.	Sutin tukuy ima.
I can’t help but.	Manam atiymanchu mana.
It used to be here.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim karqa.
They were happy in the city.	Chay llaqtapiqa kusisqam karqaku.
But he was angry.	Ichaqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
It should be good right?.	Allinmi kanan ¿aw?.
It just doesn't seem right.	Chaylla mana allinchu rikchakun.
I can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t have done it.	Manam atiymanchu karqa.
We are not better or worse.	Manam aswan allinchu nitaq aswan mana allinchu kanchik.

And they’re smart.	Hinaspa paykunaqa yachaysapa kanku.

If he stayed there long enough.	Sichus unayta chaypi qhepakurqan chayqa.
Such a person.	Chayna runa.
Instead, go with me.	Aswanpas ñoqawan riy.
It would take time, he knew.	Chaypaqqa tiempo kanqa, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
This was too easy.	Kayqa llumpay facilmi karqa.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa chayllam.
I didn’t really want to know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachayta munarqani.
I couldn't say why.	Manam niyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I didn't think it was.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
He needs the money.	Payqa chay qolqetan necesitan.
This is very simple.	Kayqa ancha facilmi.
You’ll be beautiful without it.	Mana chaywanqa sumaqmi kanki.
Not much here, though.	Mana anchatachu kaypi, ichaqa.
Who did this?	¿Pitaq kayta ruwarqa?
But he doesn’t seem worried.	Ichaqa manan llakisqa hinachu kashan.
He can’t get home.	Payqa manan wasiman chayayta atinchu.
But maybe this was wrong.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa mana allinchu karqa.
And the other half.	Hinaspa huknin kuskan.
He has always been recognized as a pioneer.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi riqsisqa karqan huk ñawpaq puriq hina.
He has nowhere else to go.	Payqa manan maymanpas rinanpaq kanchu.
He wants to get out.	Payqa lluqsiyta munan.
I would be happy to be.	Kusisqam kayman.
He was eager to find out what had happened.	Payqa anchatan munarqan imachus pasasqanmanta yachayta.
This happened a lot.	Kayqa achkatam pasarqa.
You can’t sleep.	Manam puñuyta atiwaqchu.
So, a lot of it.	Chaymi, achka.
What is the tenth.	Imataq chay chunka.
This is pretty crazy.	Kayqa ancha loco.
I just ask myself.	Chaylla tapukuni.
So he can be home for a while.	Chaymi huk tiempo wasinpi kanman.
I mean, a little bit, okay.	Niyta munani, huk chikan, allinmi.
You want to get faster or something.	Aswan utqaylla chayayta munanki utaq imapas.
That’s the least of it.	Chayqa chaymanta aswan pisi kaqmi.
It was a really terrible time.	Chiqamanta manchay tiempo karqa.
The intelligent one.	Chay yachaysapa kaq.
He didn’t have to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwananchu karqan.
The former spoke first.	Ñawpaq kaqmi ñawpaqta rimarqan.
Maybe two or three.	Ichapas iskay kimsa.
I don’t know how he feels about it.	Mana yachanichu chaymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.

Of course he knew.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa yacharqan.

I haven't seen him and here he is.	Manam paytaqa rikurqanichu hinaspa kaypi kachkan.
I don’t want this to happen.	Manam munanichu kay pasananta.
I don't have time to say much more.	Manam tiempoy kanchu aswan achkata rimanaypaq.
It means something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam niyta munan.
He was right all along.	Payqa tukuy tiempon allinta rimarqan.
It’s really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi.

He was about ten years younger than me.	Payqa yaqa chunka wata sullk'a karqan ñoqamanta.
Do it quickly and efficiently.	Utqaylla hinaspa allinta ruway.
I'd rather not think about it.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaypi yuyaymanayta.
You do everything now.	Kunanmi tukuy imatapas ruwanki.
Now it’s not true.	Kunanqa manan cheqaqchu.
So tell me about it.	Chaymi willaway.
It’s such a sad and tragic situation here.	Kaypiqa chayna llakikuypaqmi, llakikuypaqmi.
Everything was supposed to be wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi kanan karqa.
He had no choice, really.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, cheqaqtapunin.
It’s a better day.	Aswan allin p’unchawmi.
If it doesn’t work for you, there’s probably something wrong.	Sichus mana allinchu qanpaq chayqa, yaqapaschá imapas mana allinchu kashan.
But I want to know how to make one.	Ichaqa hukta imayna ruwayta yachayta munani.
I know the problem is with him.	Yachanim chay sasachakuy paymanta kasqanmanta.
There are no people.	Manam runakunaqa kanchu.
Why is he not happy?	¿Imanasqataq mana kusisqachu kachkan?
You can’t stay here!	¡Manan kaypi qhepakuyta atiwaqchu!
There are too many people.	Llumpay achka runakunam kachkan.
That's never the case.	Chayqa manan hayk'aqpas chay hinachu.
She does well in her household chores.	Wasinpi ima ruwaytapas ruwaspaqa allintam ruwan.
It was really too much.	Chiqamanta llumpay karqa.
That was completely wrong.	Chayqa llapanpim pantasqa karqa.
He had a very happy time.	Payqa ancha kusisqam pasarqa.
He doesn’t know.	Payqa manam yachanchu.
I need the money.	Qolqetan necesitasaq.
So it’s meant for him.	Chaymi paypaq nisqa.
That’s the name of it.	Chayqa sutinmi.
No, no, seriously.	Mana, mana, serio.
But he won’t be here for long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu kaypi kanqa.
He had no idea how.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatachus chayta.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
They are happier now.	Kunanqa aswan kusisqam kachkanku.
There are certain things you can do to improve your performance.	Kanmi wakin ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq, allinta ruwanaykipaq.
It’s never been there.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaypiqa karqanchu.
It still means something.	Hinallam imapas niyta munan.
Prettier, anyway.	Aswan sumaq, imayna kaptinpas.
I did really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwarqani.
I couldn’t stop anything.	Manam imatapas harkayta atirqanichu.
Two years later, he did it again.	Iskay wata qhepamanmi hukmanta chay hinata ruwarqan.
He doesn't agree.	Manam acuerdopichu kachkan.
You’re a good guy.	Allin runam kanki.
They are in a hurry.	Paykunaqa usqhayllan kashanku.
I never knew which one it was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu mayqin kasqanmantaqa.

But they weren't, she knew.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqanku, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
He was here before.	Paymi ñawpaqta kaypi karqa.
To be able to do so.	Chayna kananpaq.
Don’t do it!	¡Ama ruwaychu!
I’ve seen this.	Kayta rikurqani.
That's why he looks familiar.	Chayraykum payqa riqsisqa rikchakun.
I can’t get out of here.	Manam kaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
I don't want him to get hurt.	Manam munanichu k'irisqa kananta.
What if you can’t understand it for no other reason.	¿Imataq kanman sichus mana entiendeyta atiwaqchu mana huk imarayku.
It is indeed so.	Cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
I just don’t.	Ñuqaqa chaylla mana.
But that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan chay hinachu.
There are strangers.	Mana riqsisqa runakunam kan.
That’s what it was.	Chayqa chaymi karqa.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
But that was it.	Ichaqa chaymi karqan.
Spent a very long time with him.	Paywan ancha unayta pasarqa.
We enjoyed walking together.	Kuska kusisqa puriq kayku.
But tonight was not the case.	Ichaqa kunan tutaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it doesn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwan.
You disagree and that’s okay.	Mana acuerdopichu kanki hinaspa chayqa allinmi.
That was a big deal.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
Wasn’t that funny!	¡Manachu chayqa asikunapaq hina karqan!

I mean, really, it was.	Niyta munani, chiqamanta, chayna karqa.
But then I heard it right.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa allintam uyarirqani.
It was supposed to be there.	Chaypim kanan karqa.
I never want to see him.	Manam haykapipas payta rikuyta munanichu.
You better do the same.	Aswan allinmi kanman qampas chaynata ruwayqa.
Maybe it’s not there.	Ichapas mana chaypichu kachkan.
I can’t do anything else.	Manam hukta ruwayta atiymanchu.
Here it is again.	Kaypi yapamanta kachkan.
I was lucky enough.	Suerteyoqmi karqani.
He was out of town.	Payqa llaqtamanta hawapi kasqa.
That one day everything will be really good.	Chay huk punchaw tukuy imapas chiqaptapuni allin kanqa.
He wasn’t a bad guy.	Payqa manam millay runachu karqa.

He can’t stand it.	Mana aguantayta atinchu.
That’s what it did.	Chayqa ruwarqa.
Why is he angry?	¿Imanasqataq phiñasqa kachkan?
I don’t really like it.	Manam anchatachu gustan.
He didn’t know how to cope.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna atipananta.
No one can say for sure.	Manan pipas cheqaqtapuni niyta atinmanchu.
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
It is not the same as it used to be.	Manañam ñawpaqpi hinachu kachkan.
Lived at home for a year.	Huk wata wasipi tiyaq.

So it goes away.	Chaymi rin.
But it’s very simple.	Ichaqa ancha facilmi.
You've got to do that job for me.	Chay llamk'ayta ñuqapaq ruwanayki tiyan.
Isn’t it the case.	Manachu kan.
I want to know too.	Ñoqapas yachayta munani.
Everything you want.	Tukuy ima munasqaykita.
You can’t understand how that would happen.	Manan entiendeyta atiwaqchu imaynatachus chay ruway kanman chayta.
There is the action.	Chaypim ruwayqa kachkan.
In fact, the two are friends.	Aswanpas iskayninkun amigontin kanku.

Tomorrow, the first one.	Paqarin, ñawpaq kaq.

No one is thinking like that man.	Manan pipas chay runa hinachu yuyaykushan.
Now tell me about it.	Kunanqa willaway.
It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman karqan.
And he came to me.	Hinan payqa hamurqan.
With him and me.	Paywan ñuqawan.
These are good people.	Kaykunaqa allin runakunam.

He didn’t want the house to be cold.	Payqa manan munarqanchu wasi chiri kananpaq.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu.
No, it’s not.	Manam, manam.
There are a lot of people right now.	Achka runakunam kunanpacha kachkan.
The first day was the worst.	Ñawpaq p’unchaymi aswan mana allin karqan.

Not anymore of that.	Manaña chaymantaqa.
More on this next week.	Astawan kaymanta hamuq semanapi.
However, one day he goes too far.	Ichaqa, huk punchawmi llumpayta rin.
I don’t know how it happened.	Manam yachanichu imayna pasasqanmanta.
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu imata niyta.
No one knows where you are.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi kasqaykita.
He doesn’t want to leave with it.	Mana chaywanqa ripuyta munanchu.
Now he wants to make a film.	Kunanqa huk peliculata ruwayta munan.
You have been alone for far too long.	Qamqa ancha unayñam sapallayki kachkanki.
I was there for the guy.	Chaypim karqani.
That would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.	Manam munanichu pitapas k'irisqa kananta.
So it was a very good experience.	Chaymi ancha allin karqa.
Or the former.	Utaq ñawpaq.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
You are a better person.	Aswan allin runam kanki.
I don’t like it.	Manam gustanchu.
He wanted it very much.	Chaytaqa anchatam munarqa.
You have the last time.	Qamqa qhipa kutita.
He was always the one.	Paymi haykapipas chayna karqa.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Ichapas kay wata chayna kanqa.
But, we did it.	Ichaqa, ruwarqayku.
He seemed disappointed.	Payqa hukmanyasqa hinam karqa.
If anything, it was worse.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, aswan mana allinmi karqan.
Nothing here for him.	Mana imapas kaypi paypaq.
You always know where it is.	Sapa kutim yachanki maypi kasqanmanta.
If so, he would have done so earlier.	Chayna kaptinqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chayta ruwanman karqa.
Yes, he did.	Arí chaytam ruwarqa.

Here we are, right here.	Kaypim kachkaniku.
And you were alone.	Hinaspa sapallayki karqanki.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That’s what you said.	Chaytan nirqanki.
I’ve never been there before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaypiqa rirqanichu.
It’s a good thing to do.	Allintam ruwana.
I think he is for me.	Payqa ñuqapaq kasqanmantam piensani.
I couldn't get out of there fast enough.	Manam chaymantaqa utqaylla lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
And he wants to know why.	Hinaspa yachayta munan imarayku.
Two things very easy.	Iskay imakuna ancha facil.
The fewer people, the better.	Aswan pisi runakuna kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Did he ever do it.	¿Hayk’aqllapas ruwarqanchu.
This means he’s doing something right.	Kayqa niyta munan, payqa imatapas allinta ruwachkan.
That probably won’t happen.	Chayqa manapaschá kanqachu.
This is the whole truth.	Kaymi llapan cheqaq kaq.
Yes, but that was yesterday.	Arí, ichaqa chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
That’s obviously not true.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana cheqaqchu.

But it was a great experience.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It was a beautiful morning.	Sumaq paqarinmi karqa.
What about you?.	Qam ima?.
He refused to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu.
He had to be sure.	Payqa seguro kanan karqan.
It won’t be difficult.	Manam sasachu kanqa.
I knew nothing about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
Like, the real thing.	Imayna, chiqap kaq.
Maybe it was better, maybe it was worse.	Ichapas aswan allin karqa, ichapas aswan mana allin karqa.
Who did this to him.	Pitaq payta kay hinata ruwarqan.
It had been ten years now.	Kunanqa chunka watañam karqa.

He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.

More on that next time.	Astawan chaymanta hamuq kutipi.
I can’t hear it.	Manam uyariyta atiymanchu.
No one knows where he is.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
That’s a big deal.	Chayqa hatunmi.
So he did what he had to do.	Chaymi ima ruwananta ruwarqa.
He was happy with the result.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan chay ruwasqanmanta.
Now it’s not so good.	Kunanqa manaña ancha allinchu.
It won’t be there.	Manam kanqachu.
Here’s the problem with that.	Kaypi chaywan sasachakuy kachkan.
I saw it right away.	Chayllam rikurqani.
That wasn’t a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa manan allinchu karqan.
That was great, but it was just too early.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, ichaqa chayllaraqmi chayllaraq karqa.
Another sense of humor.	Huk yuyayniyuq.
He didn’t seem hurt at all.	Payqa manan imapipas k’irisqa hinachu karqan.
It’s just not that easy.	Chaylla mana chayna facilchu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Strong.	Sinchi.
I can say that's the case.	Chaynatam niyta atiyman.
He thought you meant something by that.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chaywan imatapas niyta munasqaykita.
He didn't need to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta necesitarqanchu.
Very much.	Anchatam.
You don’t know how it is.	Manan yachankichu imaynatachus chaytaqa.
Already, he wanted her again.	Ñam, yapamanta payta munarqa.
And the last one.	Hinaspa qhepa kaq.
All right, he said.	Allinmi, nispa.
You look good, right?	Allinmi rikchakunki.
It shouldn’t be too difficult.	Manan ancha sasachu kanan.
I can’t say enough about that.	Manam chaymantaqa allintachu niyta atiyman.
But no one can do that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
So, there you go.	Chaymi, chaypi rinki.

You can’t get a bad meal.	Mana allin mikhunata mana tariyta atiwaqchu.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
There was nothing he could do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
Not in the morning.	Tutamanta mana.
Even if it is difficult.	Sasa kaptinpas.
But he did it later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
I have not seen this.	Kaytaqa manam rikurqanichu.
Everyone knows that.	Chaytaqa llapallankum yachanku.
We didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqayku.
I was sure of it.	Seguro karqani.
I’m happy about that.	Chaymantam kusisqa kachkani.
Were they right?.	¿Allinchu karqanku?.
Yeah, that was something else.	Arí, chayqa huk imapas karqan.
Very bad.	Ancha mana allin.
What is the thing that needs to be done.	Imataq chay ruwana tiyan.
And today he did just that.	Hinaspa kunan punchaw chaynata ruwarqa.
Don’t make this about me.	Ama kaytaqa ñuqamanta ruwaychu.
I knew he did at one time.	Yacharqanim huk tiempopi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I am a very nice person.	Ancha sumaq runam kani.
That’s going to be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanqa.
You don’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munankichu.
Maybe you can’t.	Ichapas mana atiwaqchu.
But that’s really, really going to be bad.	Ichaqa chayqa cheqaqtapunin, cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu kanqa.
No one is worthy of that.	Chaypaqqa manam pipas valenchu.
I didn’t really hear it.	Manam chiqaptachu uyarirqani.
Here’s where he came from.	Kaypim hamurqa.
This was the case.	Kayqa karqan.
The best part is.	Aswan allinqa.
It’s better without it.	Aswan allinmi mana chaywanqa.
He said sure enough.	Payqa seguro nisqa.
It would be really awesome.	Chiqamanta manchay kanman.
He can’t sit still for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu tiyayta atin.
This is me, I am!	¡Kayqa ñuqam kani!
I think it’s worse in the morning.	Tutamanta aswan mana allin kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
He is still here today.	Kunankamapas kaypim kachkan.
He looked back at her.	Payqa qhepamanmi qhawarirqan.
But that everything is nothing.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas mana imapas kasqanmanta.
But it would never be the same at that time.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay tiempopiqa hinachu kanman.
Really, really bad.	Chiqap, chiqap mana allin.
What is the right thing to do?	¿Imatataq ruwana?
Today he did something he had never done before.	Kunan punchawmi mana haykapipas ruwasqanta ruwarqa.
They want you to succeed.	Paykunaqa allinta ruwanaykita munanku.
Say you don’t like the food.	Chay mikhunata mana munasqaykita niy.
But he said nothing.	Ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan hinachu ruwanan karqan.
People have to be there.	Runakuna chaypi kanan tiyan.
He wasn’t funny.	Payqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it.	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta saqiyta atirqanichu.
And he did, he went.	Hinaspa ruwarqa, rirqa.
I don’t know how many there are.	Manam yachanichu hayka kasqanmanta.
I was happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa tarikurqani.
He was the first to speak.	Paymi ñawpaqta rimaq.
Time for me to go too.	Tiempo ñuqapas rinaypaq.
And it was great, you know.	Hinaspa ancha allinmi karqa, yachanki.
That is a very quick process.	Chayqa ancha utqaylla ruwaymi.
All this kind of stuff.	Tukuy kay laya imakuna.
That was if.	Chayqa karqan sichus.
This is a beautiful dress.	Kayqa sumaq p’acha.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
Ill, it has been for a long time.	Unqusqa, unayñam chayna kachkan.
He couldn't answer.	Payqa manam kutichiyta atirqachu.
But it’s not here yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi kaypichu kachkan.
You weren’t there.	Manam chaypichu karqanki.
I will continue to do things.	Hinallam imatapas ruwasaq.
I didn’t want to leave.	Manam ripuyta munarqanichu.
I can work with that.	Chaywanmi llamkayta atiyman.
I just saw the movie.	Chayraqmi chay peliculata rikurqani.
Everything takes time.	Tukuy imapas tiempotan necesitan.
It was really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqa.
It doesn’t look bad.	Manam mana allinchu rikchakun.
Yes, they are there.	Arí, chaypim kachkanku.
He’ll be out there somewhere.	Payqa maypipas hawapi kanqa.
That was easy.	Chayqa facilmi karqa.
Do you know where the moon goes at night?	¿Yachankichu mayman killa tuta rin?
And then, we did it.	Hinaspa chaymanta, ruwarqayku.
Everyone was in good spirits.	Lliwmi allin yuyayniyuq karqaku.
No one ever really does.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu ruwan.
I'm really sorry.	Chiqaptam llakikuni.
He was fine with it.	Payqa allinmi karqan chaywan.
Describe the experiences.	Willay imakuna pasasqanmanta.
By doing what you want.	Munasqaykita ruwaspa.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atinichu.
I’m kind of busy.	Ñuqaqa huk laya ocupasqa kachkani.
Alright.	Allinmi.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I’m not going to do that.	Manam chaynatachu ruwasaq.
But it doesn't matter at the time.	Ichaqa manan chay tiempopiqa imananpaschu.
But something was very wrong.	Ichaqa imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
It was a great experience.	Hatunmi karqan.
It’s pretty big, actually.	Ancha hatunmi, chiqaptaqa.
It’s very nice though.	Ancha sumaqmi ichaqa.
I can’t wait to play.	Manam pukllayta suyayta atiymanchu.
It didn't happen very often.	Manam ancha sapa kutichu pasarqa.
I hope the easy people are right.	Suyachkani chay facil runakuna allin kasqankuta.
It wouldn’t be any other way.	Mana huk hinachu kanman.
Go on,’ he says.	Riy,’ nispas nin.
He was busier than ever.	Payqa aswan ocupasqa kasharqan.
Didn’t think about it again.	Mana hukmanta chaypi yuyaykurqanichu.
Surprisingly, this is not always the case.	Admirakuypaqmi, manam sapa kutichu chayna kan.
He never wants that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munanchu.
I mean, always.	Niyta munani, sapa kuti.
He didn’t want to do that, yet.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta munarqanchu, manaraqmi.
Thank you thank you thank you!.	Gracias gracias gracias!.
That’s what it is.	Chayqa chaymi.
You.	Qam.
This is a good thing.	Allinmi kayqa.
Something is wrong there.	Chaypiqa imapas mana allinmi.
If you’re really serious.	Sichus cheqaqtapuni serio kanki chayqa.
There are a lot of differences.	Achka chikan kaymi kan.
He is a	Payqa .
It was a weeknight.	Huk semana tutan karqan.
Not really, but it seemed that way.	Manam chiqaptachu, ichaqa chaynatam rikchakurqa.
I can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
So it’s considered a good thing to do.	Chaymi chay ruwayqa allinpaq qhawarisqa.
Like three times.	Kimsa kuti hina.
It would be a long time before he got over this.	Unayñan kanman kayta atipananpaq.
He is better off.	Payqa aswan allinmi kachkan.
He can't say exactly where he is.	Mana allintachu rimayta atin maypi kasqanmanta.
That wasn’t a good thing he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa mana allinchu kasqa.
I was never good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu karqani.
I don’t know how to describe what happened.	Manam yachanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta imayna willanaypaq.
Maybe he would have.	Ichapas chaytaqa ruwanman karqa.
Which was all day.	Imataq tukuy punchaw karqa.
I think nobody can.	Yuyaykuni mana pipas atinmanchu.
I learned not to ask.	Mana tapuyta yacharqani.
What was it about him?	¿Imataq paymanta karqa?
I don’t know, not really.	Manam yachanichu, manam chiqaptachu.
I'm pretty sure.	Allin segurom kachkani.
It's there, by the way.	Chaypim kachkan, chayna kaptinpas.
I thought he could do the talking.	Yuyarqanim chay rimayta ruwayta atinman.
I do it like twice a week.	Semanapi iskay kuti hinam ruwani.
The first year we did that.	Ñawpaq wata chayta ruwarqayku.
Instead, learn something about it.	Aswanpas chaymanta imatapas yachay.
And now here it is.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi.
How to make it beautiful.	Imaynatataq sumaq kananpaq.
I didn’t want to be here.	Manam kaypi kayta munarqanichu.
I can never be him.	Manam haykapipas pay kayta atiymanchu.
And tell it again.	Hinaspa yapamanta willay.
Great secret.	Hatun pakasqa.
He didn’t want to leave his car there.	Mana chaypi carronta saqiyta munarqanchu.
No one wants that!.	¡Manan pipas chaytaqa munanchu!.
Keep going.	Hinallam riy.
It is.	Kayqa.
What an early day.	Ima ñawpaq punchawmi.
That should be obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi kanan.
In the worst possible way.	Aswan mana allin ruwaypi.
He wanted to see her one last time.	Payqa huk qhepa kutitan rikuyta munarqan.
I'm sure he knows who he is.	Seguro kani pi kasqanmanta yachasqanmanta.
But there was no repetition.	Ichaqa manan yapamanta ruwayqa karqanchu.
Is it like this?	¿Kay hinachu?
That happened very easily.	Chayqa ancha facilmi pasarqa.
I do that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwani.
Often, that’s great.	Sapa kuti, chayqa ancha allinmi.
Don’t do anything.	Ama imatapas ruwaychu.
Perhaps he knew.	Yaqapaschá yacharqa.
It will come sooner rather than later.	Aswan pisi tiempollamantan hamunqa.
He'll come again tonight, she said.	Kunan tuta yapamanta hamunqa, nispas nin.
Great performance again.	Hukmanta hatun ruway.
He really wanted to leave.	Payqa anchatam munarqa ripuyta.
As usual in the morning.	Tutamanta sapa kuti hina.
They are good people.	Paykunaqa allin runakunam kanku.
I hope you figure it out.	Suyachkani chayta yuyaymanayta.
But even so.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas.
This one is much easier.	Kayqa aswan facilmi.
I really want to leave him.	Payta saqiyta anchata munani.
No one is like him.	Mana pipas pay hinachu.
And then you do it again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta ruwanki.
A lot of rich food.	Ancha achka qhapaq mikhuy.
Nothing is really good or really bad.	Manan imapas cheqaq allinchu nitaq cheqaq mana allinchu.
He’s been injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kashan.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
Why, he’s a good ten years older than you.	Imarayku, payqa allin chunka wata kuraq qammanta.
He wasn't sure how he would react.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imayna ruwananta.
He didn’t know this was happening.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kayqa pasashasqanmanta.
Then he went away.	Chaymantam rirqa.
He says he is busy.	Payqa ninmi ocupasqa kasqayta.
That would have been nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman karqa.
It’s about humanity.	Runa kaymanta riman.
Never ever, under any circumstances.	Ama hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas, imapipas.
I couldn’t let it happen again.	Manam hukmanta pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
It just has to be the same.	Chaylla kanan tiyan.
I wouldn't be here without him.	Mana pay kaptinqa manam kaypichu kayman.
It had a lot more ideas.	Aswan achka yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Not before.	Mana ñawpaqtaqa.
No, it’s not true at all.	Manan, manan cheqaqchu ni imapipas.
I’m not so sure about that and.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa seguro kani hinaspa.
And he’s tough.	Hinaspa payqa sinchi sinchi.
Isn’t this it.	Kaychu.
It's not there.	Manam chaypichu kachkan.
I wasn’t ready.	Manam listochu karqani.
And now he was terrified.	Hinaspa kunanqa mancharisqa kasqa.
Now he is doing well.	Kunanqa allintam ruwachkan.
I don’t think about it.	Manam chaypiqa piensanichu.
This is not the day.	Kayqa manam chay punchawchu.
Everyone knows you can be fast.	Lliwmi yachanku utqaylla kayta atisqaykita.
He can't stand it anymore.	Payqa manañam aguantayta atinmanchu.
But it was a great experience.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi karqan.
But he seemed happy.	Ichaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
That would be wonderful.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
And then a meal.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk mikhuy.
But you’re not really here.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kaypi kashanki.
I couldn't believe the new features.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chay musuq ruwaykunata.
Perhaps they are.	Ichapas chayna kanku.
It’s not supposed to be the only thing.	Manan chayllachu kananta.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I know this to be true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani.
Probably, he says.	Yaqapaschá, nispas nin.
This is not a human being.	Kayqa manam runachu.
He is alone.	Payqa sapallanmi.
It could be worse!	¡Aswan mana allinmi kanman!
But everything is available.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas kanmi.
That’s what I’m so excited about.	Chayqa anchatam kusikuni.
Do the worst thing you can do.	Aswan mana allin ruwasqaykita ruway.
He was never going to agree.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas acuerdopichu kanan karqan.
I’m glad he said it.	Kusikuni nisqanmanta.
What an amazing sight he is.	Ima admirakuypaqmi payqa.
Now he couldn’t hold anything.	Kunanqa manan imatapas hap’iyta atirqanchu.
I knew how to do that.	Chayta ruwaytaqa yacharqanim.
If anyone can do this.	Pipas kayta ruwayta atinman chayqa.
But it seems likely.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kanman hina.
In fact, he didn’t.	Aswanpas manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
I like it, to be honest.	Gustanmi, chiqap rimanaypaq.
This is my third time here.	Kaymi kimsa kuti kaypi kachkani.
And you are the one.	Hinaspa qamqa kachkanki.
He gave me the money.	Paymi chay qullqita quwarqa.
But he realized that she didn't feel the same way.	Ichaqa repararqanmi mana pay hinachu sientekusqanmanta.
Be here first thing tomorrow morning.	Paqarin paqarin tukuy ñawpaqta kaypi kay.
Today was going to be a really bad day.	Kunan punchawqa chiqap mana allin punchawmi kanman karqa.
I won’t be there.	Manam chaypichu kasaq.
But you certainly learn something.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas yachanki.
However, something was wrong.	Ichaqa, imapas mana allinchu karqa.
And that was all.	Hinaspa chaylla karqan.
He was the one.	Paymi karqa.
Make a statement.	Huk rimayta ruway.
I’m sure you know what that is.	Seguro yachanki imachus chay kasqanmanta.
So we had to do something.	Chaymi imatapas ruwanayku karqa.
How do you do this?.	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwana?.
You can continue if you want.	Munaspaqa hinallam ruwawaq.
One day here or there will be nothing for you.	Huk punchaw kaypi utaq chaypiqa manam imapas kanqachu qampaq.
They were so amazing.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi chaypi karqaku.
I can’t stop it.	Manam harkayta atiymanchu.
Strong weather.	Sinchi tiempo.
I tried several times.	Achka kutitam kallpanchakurqani.
But at least he noticed that it felt good.	Ichaqa aswanpas repararqanmi allin sientekusqanmanta.
He doesn’t want money.	Payqa manam qullqita munanchu.
It all sounds so stupid.	Tukuy imapas ancha sonso hinam uyarikun.
So scared of it.	Chayna mancharisqa.
Two months ago.	Iskay killa ñawpaqta.
She couldn't believe he was worried about it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu chaymanta llakisqa kashasqanmanta.
But it was difficult.	Ichaqa sasam karqa.
He didn’t want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta munarqanchu.
there is something good about it.	chaypiqa imapas allinmi kachkan.
It’s actually a big deal.	Chiqaptaqa hatun ruwaymi.
That’s pretty easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi.
What seems to be the problem?	¿Imataq chay sasachakuy kanman hina?
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
He really did that.	Chiqaptam chaytaqa ruwarqa.
Maybe he can do it.	Ichapas payqa ruwayta atinman.
So it was the best thing ever.	Chaymi aswan allinqa karqan.
Now may be the time.	Kunanqa ichapas chay tiempo kanman.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatunmi.
What a beautiful sight.	Ima sumaqmi.
Nice.	Sumaq.
There are some people to talk to him.	Kanmi wakin runakuna paywan rimayta.
I know he won't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwananta.
He was really smart about her.	Chiqaptam paymanta yachaysapa karqa.
This is not a practice.	Kayqa manam ruwaychu.
But you can do well here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa allintam ruwawaq.
I have seen it many times.	Achka kutitam rikurqani.
But at least there is something for a reason.	Ichaqa aswanpas imaraykupas imapas kanmi.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He was here last night.	Payqa qayna tutam kaypi karqa.
They certainly are.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa kanku.
Now, this process is much easier.	Kunanqa, kay ruwayqa aswan facilmi.
I just don’t think I’m in a position to do that.	Chaytaqa manapaschá chayta ruwanaypaq hinachu kani.
This was to be the final challenge.	Kaymi qhepa kaq sasachakuy kanan karqan.
I didn’t realize that before.	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa repararqanichu.
He was a bit of a loner.	Payqa huk chhikantan sapallan karqan.
And a little bit.	Hinaspa huk chikan.
That was the guy.	Chayqa karqan chay wayna.
One night he went swimming alone.	Huk tutan sapallan nadaq rirqan.
You’re really doing it the wrong way.	Chiqamanta mana allin ñanta ruwachkanki.
It certainly isn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu.
He wants to do it every day.	Sapa punchawmi chayta ruwayta munan.
I really wanted to.	Chiqaptam munarqani.
It’s a bad thing.	Mana allin kaqmi.
You’re here to stay.	Kaypi kachkanki.
Pretty sure to go away this summer.	Yaqa seguro kay verano ripunanpaq.
He was no longer a man.	Payqa manañam runachu karqa.
This seems reasonable.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam.
I think this is ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensani.
He’s very nice about it.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi chaymanta.
This thing here, that thing there.	Kay imapas kaypi, chay imapas chaypi.
I have always said that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim nirqani.
If you want to know.	Yachayta munaspaqa.
Not at all, not at all.	Manan imapipas, nitaq imapipas.
I wonder what will happen?.	Tapukuni imataq kanqa?.
No one could do anything about it.	Manam pipas imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
So it needs some restraint.	Chaymi necesitan huk chhikanta hark’ayta.
I don’t really want to talk to him.	Manam anchatachu paywan rimayta munani.
It was kind of funny, and ridiculous.	Chayqa huk laya asikunapaq hinam karqa, hinaspa asikunapaq hina.
He soon learned something else.	Pisi tiempollamantan hukta yacharqan.
Nothing, really.	Mana imapas, chiqap.
But he didn’t stay with her long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu paywan kasharqan.
But no one is perfect in everything.	Ichaqa manan pipas tukuy imapipas allintachu riman.
But that's where he started thinking.	Ichaqa chaypim yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa.
That’s it in the end though.	Chayqa tukukuypi ichaqa.
What is the right thing to do?	¿Imata ruwanapaq?
He refused to drive.	Payqa manan carrota manejayta munarqanchu.
I certainly did it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqani.
He was there that day.	Chay punchawmi chaypi karqa.
It was probably half true.	Yaqapaschá kuskan cheqaq karqan.
I’m doing that.	Chayta ruwachkani.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
I know what he wants.	Yachanim ima munasqanmanta.
Ten days to go there.	Chunka punchaw chayman rinanpaq.
But I doubt it.	Ichaqa iskayrayani.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
You mean it right.	Allintam niyta munanki.
You are better than me.	Qanmi ñoqamanta aswan allin kanki.
He had no idea that anything was wrong.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I knew exactly what he was doing.	Allintam yacharqani ima ruwasqanmanta.
I don't understand what the problem is.	Manam entiendenichu ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
He’s good, but not this good.	Payqa allinmi, ichaqa manan kay allinchu.
You seemed very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa hinan karqanki.
He’s the one.	Paymi chay.
I was happier than ever.	Aswan kusisqam karqani.
And now.	Hinaspa kunan.
But it was better than that.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Here, yes, it is.	Kaypiqa, arí.
Everything was a bit rough and ready.	Tukuy imapas huk chikan askha hinaspa listo karqan.
We are no longer good enough.	Manañam allinchu kanchik.
Yes, it wasn’t a good thing.	Arí, manan allinchu karqan.
But he says it all the time.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi chaytaqa nin.
I don't have time to do this right now.	Kunanqa manam tiempoy kanchu kayta ruwanaypaq.
Or, it should be.	Utaq, chhayna kanan.
It’s not just that.	Mana chayllachu.
I felt really sad.	Chiqamanta llakisqa tarikurqani.
This can be a difficult task.	Kayqa sasa ruwaymi kanman.
I know exactly what he means.	Allintam yachani ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I do so much for you.	Anchatam qampaq ruwani.
It’s been working for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan llank’ashan.
That is not true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
And that would be him.	Hinaspa chaymi pay kanman.
Soon he came over.	Pisi tiempollamantan chayman hamurqan.
It’s a pity.	Llakikuypaqmi.
Today is a great day.	Kunan punchawqa hatun punchawmi.
It's cold today, isn't it?	Kunan punchawmi chiri kachkan, ¿aw?
You were very good.	Ancha allinmi karqanki.
This is the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
I didn’t want to stop him.	Manam harkayta munarqanichu.
However, it may not be as effective.	Ichaqa, manapaschá chay hina allinchu kanman.
He is the truth.	Paymi cheqaq kaq.
So he looked at it.	Chaymi payqa chayta qhawarirqan.
You were told to do it.	Chayta ruwanaykipaqmi nisurqanki.
One, now.	Huknin, kunan.
But it’s not really.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu.
I was the one.	Ñuqaqa karqani.
And then there was none.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana karqachu.
Very happy for me.	Ancha kusisqa ñuqapaq.
So it will probably be a good thing.	Chaymi yaqapaschá allin kanqa.
I will never do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
Half of it is about him.	Kuskan paymanta.
He is so amazing.	Payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi.
I couldn’t seem to stop it.	Manapaschá hark’ayta atirqanichu hina.
I always wanted to know that.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yachayta munarqani.
I’m a big girl.	Hatun sipasmi kani.
Go for a walk.	Puriq riy.
That’s a cold chill.	Chayqa chiri chiri.
All this is that.	Tukuy kayqa chaymi.
I thought you wanted to hang out with me.	Yuyarqanim ñuqawan kuska kayta munasqaykita.
I thought it was really nice.	Chiqamanta sumaq kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani.
It was always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqa.
He was the wise one.	Paymi chay yachaysapa kasqa.
I’m the one who.	Ñuqaqa kani chay.
What if there is no tomorrow?	¿Imataq kanman paqarin mana kaptinqa?
He’s going to be really good.	Payqa chiqap allinmi kanqa.
Most of the time you didn't know who they were.	Yaqa llapanpim mana yacharqankichu pikuna kasqankuta.
There is nothing he can do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
You can’t wait any longer.	Manañam suyayta atiwaqchu.
In fact, it was excellent.	Aswanpas ancha allinmi karqan.
He’s a good guy.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
That’s what you said.	Chaynatam nirqanki.
And so things went wrong.	Hinaspa chaymi imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
He died shortly afterwards.	Pisi tiempollamantan wañupurqan.
I don’t see anything like that.	Chay hinaqa manan rikunichu.
I want to walk around.	Puriyta munani.
We can’t wait for it.	Manam suyayta atichwanchu.
It’s harder, right?	Aswan sasam, ¿aw?
That’s obviously not the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
You were the one.	Qanmi karqanki.
That doesn’t do it right.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
That didn't seem right.	Chayqa manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
I did that last year.	Chaytaqa qayna wata ruwarqani.
It’s not good for you.	Mana allinmi qampaq.
If so, it is not.	Chayna kaptinqa manam.
The man knows how to tell a story.	Chay runaqa huk willakuyta willayta yachan.
That's what you want to do, it's fine with me.	Chaynatam ruwayta munanki, allinmi ñuqawanqa.
These are real people.	Kaykunaqa chiqap runakunam.
No one knew what it would be like.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imayna kananta.
It sounds good and nice.	Allinmi sumaqmi uyarikun.
He was a teacher.	Paymi yachachiq kasqa.
And he’s the one.	Hinaspa payqa.
But I am happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kachkani.
He is not worth anything.	Payqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
Something would be safe, it would be home.	Imapas seguro kanman, wasi kanman.
Worried about something.	Imamantapas llakisqa.
You want to come here.	Kayman hamuyta munanki.
If you’re happy, say so.	Kusisqa kanki chayqa, chayta niy.
He said that he was.	Payqa chaynatam nirqa.
I don’t want that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa munanichu.
A sad day.	Llakisqa punchaw.
He tried, but couldn’t understand.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi, ichaqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu.
That coffee is delicious, right?	Chay kukata sumaqmi, ¿aw?
It had him for a long time.	Unayñan payta hap’irqan.
I’ll have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanay kanqa.
That would be a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi kanman.
He doesn’t know how to sit.	Payqa manan tiyayta yachanchu.
Whatever he had to do, it had to be right away.	Ima ruwanan kaptinpas chayllam kanan karqa.
He wasn't quite sure what he was going to do next.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imatachus qhepaman ruwananta.
He couldn't remember anymore.	Manañam yuyariyta atirqachu.
If you want to get there faster.	Aswan utqaylla chayman chayayta munanki chayqa.
That’s how I like it.	Chaynatam gustan.
It was a wonderful experience.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He had wanted to be for a long time.	Payqa unayñan kayta munarqan.
There is nothing we can do.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
I knew that very well.	Allintam chaytaqa yacharqani.
I know for sure.	Chiqamanta yachani.
Not like last night.	Mana qayna tuta hinachu.
Can you repeat that last sentence?	¿Atiwaqchu yapamanta chay qhepa rimayta?
Tomorrow, sure, tomorrow.	Paqarin, seguro, paqarin.
But something, maybe.	Ichaqa imapas, ichapas.
It seemed easy enough.	Chayqa facilmi rikchakurqa.
Something is very wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas ancha mana allinmi.
It’s very difficult.	Ancha sasam.
He wanted money.	Payqa qolqetan munarqan.
Someone like you.	Pipas qam hina.
This was bad, but not the worst.	Kayqa mana allinmi karqa, ichaqa manam aswan mana allinchu karqa.
This doesn't make any sense.	Kayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
This is not strictly true.	Kayqa manan sinchi cheqaqchu.
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi.
He wasn’t real.	Payqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
And now he does.	Hinaspa kunanqa ruwan.
It’s a learning process.	Yachay ruwaymi.
But I want it to happen more often than it does.	Ichaqa munani aswan askha kutita chay pasananta, chay pasasqanmantaqa.
But there is no one.	Ichaqa manan pipas kanchu.
I’m the one.	Paymi kani.
He’s not the best.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu.
So it was half a day.	Chaymi chay punchawqa kuskan punchaw karqa.
He knew how to play.	Payqa pukllayta yacharqa.
What a great success.	Ima hatun allin ruwaymi.
Is that really the case.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayta.
That’s going to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa.
This is interesting, isn’t it?	Kayqa sumaqmi, ¿aw?
Yes, he couldn’t.	Arí, manan atirqanchu.
You can’t leave.	Manam ripuyta atiwaqchu.
You’re the one.	Qanmi kanki.
He is a very wicked man.	Payqa ancha millay runam.
I really can’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atinichu.
But you know better.	Qanmi ichaqa aswan allinta yachanki.
So, not like me at all.	Chaymi, mana ñuqa hinachu ni imapipas.
But it should be soon.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi kanan.
Probably me too.	Yaqapaschá ñuqapas.
It’s a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi.
It was the best thing ever.	Chayqa karqan hayk’aqpas aswan allin kaqmi.
Everything seemed so difficult.	Tukuy imapas ancha sasa hinam karqa.
I went there last week.	Qayna semanan chayman rirqani.
Time passed by.	Tiempo pasarqa.
That sounds absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam uyarikun.
He refused to listen.	Payqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu.
He, who was	Pay, pichus karqan
This is to make things better.	Kayqa imapas allin kananpaqmi.
There wasn’t really a reason.	Manam chiqaptaqa imaraykupas karqachu.
It’s a wonderful time, indeed.	Sumaq tiempon, cheqaqtapunin.
But that goes for something out there.	Ichaqa chayqa rin imapaqpas chay hawapi.
Tell me why.	Willaway imarayku.
I didn’t want to think about being sick.	Manam unqusqa kaypi yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
That he needed it more.	Chayta astawan necesitasqanmanta.
It just looks stupid.	Sonso hinallam rikchakun.
I don’t understand anything, he said.	Manam imamantapas entiendenichu, nispas nin.
If there are people.	Runakuna kaptinqa.
I didn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwarqani.
I wasn’t sure it was right for him.	Manam segurochu karqani paypaq allin kasqanmanta.
He looked at them quickly.	Chaykunataqa usqhayllan qhawarirqan.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mana imapas kanchu.
I knew it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa yacharqanim.
He is a very intelligent man.	Payqa ancha yachaysapa runam.
He was there for the guy.	Payqa chaypi kasqa.
He said ‘probably not’.	Payqa ‘yaqapaschá mana’ nispas nisqa.
I’m afraid that’s all.	Manchakuni chaylla kasqanmanta.
There is a girl.	Huk sipasmi kachkan.
I like both of them.	Iskayninkum gustan.
So that would have been better.	Chaymi chayqa aswan allin kanman karqan.
One every day.	Sapa punchaw hukta.
That was no longer true.	Chayqa manañan cheqaqchu karqan.
And you have to do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanayki.
He was really there.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi karqa.
They are extremely good.	Paykunaqa sinchi allinmi kanku.
Next time less.	Qatiqnin kutipi aswan pisi.
You don’t know what’s going on.	Manan yachankichu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
That’s the last thing he would want.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi munanman.
That’s a good thing.	Chayqa huk allin ruwaymi.
But he's fine with that now.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi chaywanqa.
And that’s what it’s all about, you know.	Hinaspa chaymi tukuy ima, yachanki.
But, of course.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin.
We took a walk in the morning.	Tutamanta puriyta ruwarqayku.
I knew what it was like.	Yacharqanim imayna kasqanmanta.
Here is the best part.	Kaypiqa aswan allin kaqmi kachkan.
He was a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runam karqa.
I don’t want to talk about him.	Manam paymanta rimayta munanichu.
How beautiful.	Imayna sumaq.
It’s best to do it consistently.	Aswan allinqa sapa kutilla ruwaymi.
He would be fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kanman.
I really didn’t want to go.	Chiqaptaqa manam riyta munarqanichu.
We are not there.	Manam chaypichu kachkaniku.
Do that first.	Ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruway.
Beautiful house.	Sumaq wasi.
I prefer to walk at night.	Aswan allinmi tuta puriyta.
Two for you.	Iskay qampaq.
I think about that sometimes.	Chaytan wakin kutipi yuyaykuni.
I wasn’t up to it.	Manam chayman hinachu karqani.
He has a bad attitude.	Payqa mana allin yuyayniyuqmi.
I didn’t want to see any more.	Manam astawan qawayta munarqanichu.
I don’t feel comfortable.	Manam allintachu sientekuni.
I'm sorry, I don't know exactly where it is, but it's there.	Pampachaykuway, manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmanta, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
They were here, now they’re not.	Paykunaqa kaypi karqanku, kunanqa mana.
I wasn’t surprised.	Manam admirakurqanichu.
I am not so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu kani.
I didn't think so, he said.	Manam chaynatachu piensarqani, nispa.
Now, this was a really big deal.	Kunanqa, kayqa chiqap hatun ruwaymi karqa.
He was the best she knew.	Payqa aswan allinqa karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
I know it’s going to happen.	Yachanim chayna kananta.

That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
Happier than ever.	Aswan kusisqa.
I can’t imagine that.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I was a human being.	Runa karqani.
He didn’t do that right.	Payqa manan chaytaqa allintachu ruwarqan.
I'm really sorry about this.	Chiqaptam kaymantaqa llakikuni.
A very intelligent man.	Ancha yachaysapa runa.

Can you help me out.	¿Atiwaqchu yanapayta.
I didn’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.

That’s what he knew.	Chaytan payqa yacharqan.
You have done better.	Aswan allintam ruwarqanki.
And that’s a good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi.
I wasn’t sure which one it was.	Manam segurochu karqani mayqin kasqanmanta.
This is where things started to take a different shape.	Kaypim imapas huk rikchayniyuq kayta qallaykurqa.
I’m proud of you.	Orgulloso kani qanmanta.
I'm really proud of that.	Chiqaptam chaymantaqa orgulloso kani.
No they are great.	Manan paykunaqa hatunmi kanku.
He knew that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yacharqa.
I can’t comment on that.	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta atiymanchu.
Was he really in such a predicament?	¿Cheqaqtachu chayna sasachakuypi tarikurqa?
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Yuyarqanim yanapayta munasqaykita nisqaykita.
What is the second.	Imataq iskay kaq.
It’s a good thing for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi.
Where in the world is he?	¿Maypitaq kay pachapi kachkan?
But then there it was.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chaypim karqa.
I want to remember.	Yuyariyta munani.
And really do it.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni ruway.
It is better to do so.	Aswan allinmi chayta ruwayqa.
Maybe I’m the one.	Ichapas chayna kani.
It did him very well.	Ancha allintam payta ruwarqa.
He is such a good guy.	Payqa chayna allin runam.
But that is not true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu chayqa.
You may think it doesn’t matter but unfortunately, it does.	Ichapas yuyanki mana imananpaschu ichaqa llakikuypaqmi, chaymi.
I am very proud of myself.	Anchatam orgulloso kani.
He didn’t say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
I had no idea at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanichu.
He can’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
As in the past.	Ñawpaqpi hina.
He said he didn't know why.	Paymi nirqa imanasqa kasqanmanta mana yachasqanmanta.
I can’t say that it is.	Manam niyta atiymanchu chayna kasqanmanta.
He barely gave her a chance to speak.	Payqa yaqapaschá rimananpaq oportunidadta qorqan.
He did a very good job.	Ancha allintam ruwarqa.
Now he was terrified.	Kunanqa mancharisqa kasqa.
Something out there.	Imapas hawapi.
I don't remember that.	Chaytaqa manam yuyarinichu.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
If so, why didn't he say that?	Chayna kaptinqa, ¿imanasqataq mana chaynatachu nirqa?
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
Learn a new skill.	Musuq yachayta yachay.
I know better than I do.	Aswan allinta yachani.
It wasn't very busy.	Manam anchatachu ocupasqa karqa.
There was no one there.	Manam pipas chaypiqa karqachu.
I think that was the right thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
I would have been here.	Ñuqa kayman karqa.
Now go ahead.	Kunanqa riy.
I wanted to be that person.	Chay runa kaytam munarqani.
First, the length of time.	Ñawpaqtaqa, hayk’a tiempo kasqanmanta.
Everything about him was above all else.	Paymanta tukuy imapas tukuy imamanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
You made him yourself.	Paytaqa qanmi ruwarqanki.
I wish it had been harder.	Aswan sasa kanman karqan chayqa, allinmi kanman karqan.
I’m not going anywhere.	Manam maymanpas risaqchu.

Didn’t pay much attention to it.	Mana anchatachu chayta qhawarirqan.
Yes, they are here.	Arí kaypi kachkanku.
That may not be true.	Chayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
Let's hope he does it anyway.	Suyasun imayna kaptinpas chayta ruwananta.
If he doesn’t, he will be fired.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa, qarqusqa kanqa.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I’m not ready for it.	Manam listochu kani.
He didn’t know anything.	Payqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu.
He didn’t want to talk to her right away.	Manam chayllachu paywan rimayta munarqa.
Where?' 	Maypi?'
It would be better.	Aswan allin kanman.
I heard about it this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi chaymanta uyarirqani.
I didn’t know what to say.	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta.
It’s a good thing, but it’s not safe.	Allin ruwaymi ichaqa mana segurochu.

It said he was the best.	Chayqa nirqam payqa aswan allin kasqanmanta.
He knew that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yacharqa.
It’s not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu.
He had just been too good.	Payqa chayraqmi llumpay allin karqa.
But we did that three years ago.	Ichaqa kinsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chayta ruwarqayku.
So he didn’t want it right.	Chaymi payqa mana allintachu munarqan.
He has a bad attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuq.
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
But if you don’t, that’s fine.	Ichaqa mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
Don’t be worth it.	Ama imapaqpas valenchu.
But they know that.	Ichaqa chaytan yachanku.
I thought it was pretty good.	Allin allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Yes, it was an act.	Arí, chayqa ruwaymi karqan.
That was a difficult thing.	Chayqa sasam karqa.
He can’t believe it’s me.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu ñoqa kasqayta.
I really don't like doing it.	Chiqaptaqa manam gustawanchu ruwayqa.
But this is where it goes.	Ichaqa kaymi rin.
All better in the end.	Tukuy aswan allin tukukuypi.
Yes, he will be fine.	Arí, payqa allinmi kanqa.
What in the world are you doing?	¿Imatataq kay pachapi ruwachkanki?
He wanted to be this.	Payqa kaytam munarqan.
Very good performer.	Ancha allin ruwaq.
I don’t think it’s going to be that hard.	Manam yuyanichu chayna sasa kananta.
He really wanted this job.	Payqa anchatam kay llamkayta munarqa.
I wanted to be more famous.	Ñuqaqa aswan riqsisqa kaytam munarqani.
You were there for a while.	Chaypin huk rato karqanki.
There is no information.	Mana willay kanchu.
That was the first one.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq kaqmi.
He couldn’t though.	Payqa manan atirqanchu ichaqa.
I’m so, so worried.	Ñuqaqa chayna, ancha llakisqa kani.

Now the other thing.	Kunanqa huk kaq.
And how did you do it.	Hinaspa imaynatataq ruwarqanki.
If that is true.	Sichus chay cheqaq kanman chayqa.
He loves to play.	Payqa pukllayta anchata munan.
I don't really know how to do this.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
Say what you mean.	Ima niyta munasqaykita niy.
There are three of us.	Kimsa kanchik.
He probably would have done that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá ruwanman karqan.
Very very good.	Ancha ancha allin.
But he said they were not.	Ichaqa nirqanmi mana chayna kasqankuta.
In fact, he wasn't sure he wanted to find her.	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqa tariyta munasqanmanta.
You’re a bad guy.	Mana allin runa kasqaykita.
Maybe he really will.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni ruwanqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He has a wonderful mind, he says.	Payqa sumaq yuyayniyuqmi, nispas nin.
You’re very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa kanki.
He was the spokesman in the city.	Paymi llaqtapi rimaq kasqa.
They are always in the lead.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim ñawpaqpi kanku.
He probably knew that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yacharqan.
That lasted two weeks.	Chayqa iskay semanan karqan.
This makes the job efficient.	Kaymi llamkayta allinta ruwan.
No one could stop him.	Manam pipas harkayta atirqachu.
I really don't remember.	Chiqaptaqa manam yuyarinichu.
No one can do everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
That’s the only good thing.	Chaylla allin kaq.
Why not, he said.	Imanasqataq mana, nispa.
The last time.	Qhipa kuti.
Do this now!	¡Kunan kayta ruway!

That's about it though.	Chayqa chaymantam ichaqa.
I'll make a report on this soon.	Kaymanta chaylla willakuyta ruwasaq.
But it was only once.	Ichaqa huk kutillanmi karqan.
He said he would learn to cope with it.	Paymi nirqa chaywan aguantayta yachananta.
But I don’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwani.
However, you better do that.	Ichaqa, aswan allinmi chayta ruwanayki.
I knew you really wanted something like that.	Yacharqanim chayna kaqta anchata munasqaykita.
A better future.	Aswan allin hamuq pacha.
Who is the first?	¿Pitaq ñawpaqta kachkan?
The fact that it is not good.	Mana allin kasqanmanta.
He was more focused now.	Kunanqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
No one was at home.	Manam pipas wasinpi karqachu.
I don’t always want to do this.	Manam sapa kutichu kayta ruwayta munani.
I hope to work in a beauty salon.	Suyachkani sumaq kay wasipi llamkayta.
I didn’t realize how quickly the time passed.	Manam repararqanichu chay tiempo chaylla pasasqanmanta.
That was something great.	Chayqa imapas hatunmi karqa.
It’s a cause for injury.	Chayqa k’irisqa kananpaqmi.
He wants to go do something else.	Payqa huk ruwaytapas ruwananpaqmi riyta munan.
He seemed sick of this.	Payqa kaymantaqa unqusqa hinam karqa.
He goes halfway.	Payqa kuskan rin.
And it has to be somewhere.	Hinaspa maypipas kanan.
It was summer time.	Verano tiempon karqan.
But he did it better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
And so it happened.	Hinaspa chayna pasarqa.
Maybe there was nothing.	Ichapas mana imapas karqachu.
He had been there before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi karqan.
But always being uncomfortable.	Ichaqa sapa kutilla mana allin kay.
But this is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan kayqa kanchu.
Being outside was hard.	Hawapi kayqa sasam karqa.
It’s very nice outside.	Ancha sumaqmi hawapi.
I didn’t want to go anymore.	Manañam riyta munarqanichu.
He took a closer look at the car.	Payqa aswan allintan carrota qhawarirqan.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atinichu.
Nothing else.	Mana huk imapas.
You know, a stranger in a strange city.	Yachanki, mana riqsisqa llaqtapi mana riqsisqa runa.
And that’s what’s so interesting.	Hinaspa chaymi ancha sumaq.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
I can’t do any better.	Manam aswan allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
That’s not true!	¡Chayqa manan cheqaqchu!
The talk went well.	Chay rimayqa allintam rirqa.
Well! 	Allin!
And so do you.	Hinaspa qampas.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
How did you know that?	¿Imaynatataq chaynata yacharqanki?
I would love to hear the story.	Munaymanmi chay willakuyta uyariyta.

He was obviously upset.	Sut’inmi phiñasqa kasharqan.
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.

Probably the right thing to do.	Yaqapaschá allin kaq.
And now in the world.	Hinaspa kunan kay pachapi.
Please don’t do this.	Ama hina kaspa, ama kayta ruwaychu.

You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
There’s no real secret.	Manam chiqap pakasqa kanchu.
Like really hungry.	Chiqap yarqasqa hina.
I am so glad that it did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
This was a chance.	Kayqa karqan chansa.
He knew that.	Yacharqa chay.
But the other thing about it.	Ichaqa huknin kaqmi chaymanta.
That’s the real beauty.	Chayqa chiqap sumaq kaymi.
I'm sorry.	Llakikuni.
He got it right.	Payqa chaytan chaskirqan.
You’re not good enough.	Mana allinchu kanki.
Quickly, he says.	Usqhaylla, nispas nin.
That means you are human.	Chayqa runa kasqaykita niyta munan.
I was really, really happy.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta kusisqa tarikurqani.
But it’s not yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi.
He couldn’t see or hear anything.	Manas imatapas rikuyta nitaq uyariyta atirqachu.
They were all there.	Llapallankum karqaku.
Happy about it, for sure.	Kusisqa chaymanta, seguro.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ama imananpaschu.
Over there.	Chaypi.
But things were not going well.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan imapas.
He wanted to catch her.	Payqa hap’iyta munarqan.
No one knows what’s going to happen.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus kananta.
Today was a very special day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
But probably too much time.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá nishuta tiempo.
He knew it was too easy.	Payqa yacharqanmi nishuta facil kasqanmanta.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
It was cold.	Chiri kasqa.
It was ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam karqa.
That didn't go well.	Chayqa mana allintachu rirqa.
And you’re the first one.	Hinaspa qanmi kanki ñawpaq kaq.
There’s nothing there.	Chaypi mana chaypichu.
I didn't feel too good that night.	Chay tutaqa manam ancha allinchu tarikurqani.
You are still doing it.	Hinallam chayta ruwachkanki.
But too much talk is a bad thing.	Ichaqa llumpay rimayqa mana allinmi.
He’s really good.	Payqa chiqap allinmi.
But no one did that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
That would have been awesome.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi kanman karqa.
No, that it is.	Manan, kasqanmanta.
And now he looked scared.	Hinaspa kunanqa mancharisqa hina qhawarisqa.
He repeated it twice.	Chaytaqa iskay kutitam yapamanta nirqa.
He actually said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nisqa.
But before that, nothing.	Ichaqa manaraq chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa, mana imapas.
Almost never being happy.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas kusisqa kaspa.
He looks really good.	Payqa chiqap allinmi rikchakun.
You know where you want to go.	Mayman riyta munasqaykita yachanki.
He was obviously upset.	Payqa sut’inmi phiñasqa kasharqan.
I mean it's yours, she said.	Niyta munani qampa kasqanmanta, nispas nin.
He didn't know how he knew that.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta yachasqanmanta.
I had to do it right.	Allintam chaytaqa ruwanay karqa.
He wasn't supposed to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwananchu karqa.
No one else wants to say anything.	Manan huk runaqa imatapas niyta munanchu.
Surely they know better.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa aswan allinta yachanku.
I really enjoy doing it.	Chiqamanta kusikuni chayta ruwaspa.
I can't be the only person here.	Kaypiqa manam ñuqallachu runa kayta atiyman.
Not like him.	Mana pay hinachu.
He can really do anything.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwayta atin.
But there it is.	Ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
I'm' the.	Ñuqaqa' chay.
It’s good for you.	Allinmi qampaq.
Now I am sure of it.	Kunanqa segurom kachkani chaymantaqa.
Who knows why.	Pi yachan imarayku.
It’s a great one.	Hatunmi.
No one wants to get hurt.	Manan pipas k’irisqa kayta munanchu.
No, that wasn’t true.	Manan, chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
The night is like that.	Tutaqa hinam.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
Then the second one.	Chaymanta iskay kaq.
It’s not that difficult.	Manam chayna sasachu.
This way please.	Kay hinata ama hina kaspa.
I have a different opinion.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi kani.
That’s the kind of person he is.	Chayna runam payqa.
It’s a very big one.	Ancha hatunmi.
I don’t know his name.	Manam sutinta yachanichu.
This should be the case.	Kayqa kanan tiyan.
If only he hadn’t wanted so much.	Sichus mana anchatachu munanman karqan chayqa.
He knows who he is.	Payqa yachanmi pi kasqanmanta.
Two men with bad appearance.	Mana allin rikchayniyuq iskay runa.
He wanted to be rich.	Payqa qhapaq kaytan munarqan.
He was still there.	Payqa hinallam karqa.
I felt like that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinpaq hinam tarikurqani.
The truth in the end.	Chiqap kaq tukukuypi.
They never agreed on anything.	Manam haykapipas imapipas acuerdopichu karqaku.
I would like to.	Munaymanmi.
He wasn’t a human being.	Payqa manam runachu karqa.
I want to be so bad there.	Chaypim ancha millay kayta munani.
A lot of that.	Achka chaymanta.
Some things to do.	Wakin imakuna ruwanapaq.
Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allinmi.
And then one day it happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk punchaw chayna pasarqa.
That’s not so easy.	Chayqa manan ancha facilchu.
But this is what he did.	Ichaqa kaytan ruwarqan.
Now that was about half the task.	Kunanqa chayqa yaqa kuskan ruwaymi karqan.
I am not sure here.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu kani.
He really wanted to know.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yachayta munarqan.
They have always been, both of them.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqaku, iskayninku.
It’s the truth.	Chiqap kaqmi.
It wasn't that good for sure.	Manam chayna allinchu karqa seguro.
This should be better.	Kayqa aswan allinmi kanan.
I didn’t want to tell you.	Manam willayta munarqanichu.
I certainly never did.	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
But doing so well is not easy.	Ichaqa chayta allinta ruwayqa manan facilchu.
I was proud of it.	Chaywanmi orgulloso karqani.
Like many others, I am struggling.	Askha runakuna hinan sasachakuypi tarikuni.
It’s so beautiful!	¡Ancha sumaqmi!
Not these people here.	Mana kay runakuna kaypichu.
I can't talk about it, ever.	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu, haykapipas.
I didn’t want to talk.	Manam rimayta munarqanichu.
He is still a villain.	Payqa kunankamapas millay runam kachkan.
But the worst part is.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinqa.
So you know it’s good.	Chaymi yachanki allin kasqanmanta.
That was a few years ago.	Chayqa karqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He’s that good.	Payqa chay allinmi.
Now it will never happen.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
I feel certain about this.	Kaymantaqa segurom tarikuni.
That’s something you don’t want to happen to you.	Chayqa mana munankichu qanpaq pasananta.
This doesn’t seem to be the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
But next time.	Ichaqa qatiqnin kutipi.
Don’t you want to eat?	¿Manachu mikhuyta munanki?
That’s what he did.	Chaynatam ruwarqa.
I don’t remember him being drunk, either.	Manam yuyarinichu machasqa kasqanmanta, nitaq.
This is very obvious.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi.
I’ve said that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi nirqani.
He went there twice.	Payqa iskay kutitan chayman rirqan.
But do it, please.	Ichaqa chayta ruway.
You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwanki.
I’m really worried.	Chiqamanta llakisqa kachkani.
He doesn’t want to leave.	Payqa manam ripuyta munanchu.
Is this a bad person?	¿Mana allin runachu kay?
He knew it was wonderful.	Payqa yacharqanmi ancha sumaq kasqanmanta.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
What a very nice sight.	Ima ancha sumaqmi.
I was a little disappointed.	Huk chikan hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
I don’t know where.	Manam yachanichu maypi.
I really need them.	Chaykunataqa anchatam necesitasaq.
So no one knows about it.	Chaymi mana pipas chaymantaqa yachanchu.
Good morning, he repeated.	Allin p’unchaw, nispas yapamanta nisqa.
It worked out really well.	Chiqamanta allinta lluqsirqa.
I want to say thank you.	Gracias niyta munani.
This can have a negative effect on performance.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwaypi ruwanman.
Bad.	Mana allin.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I never knew why.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
You are ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam kanki.
I just don’t know what.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imata.
Yes, they were wrong.	Arí, pantasqa karqanku.
He said no, he couldn’t, it wouldn’t be right.	Payqa manan, manan atinmanchu, manan allinchu kanman nispas nisqa.
I wasn’t happy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu karqani.
Does that make any sense.	¿Chayqa imapaqpas valenchu.
I don’t like talking.	Manam rimayqa gustanchu.
But there was nothing.	Ichaqa manan imapas karqanchu.
He was a he.	Payqa huk paymi karqan.
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
Here’s what I mean.	Kaypi niyta munani.
That’s the hardest part.	Chayqa aswan sasa kaqmi.
If this sounds like you, give it a try.	Sichus kay qan hina uyarikun chayqa, huk kutita ruway.
I can’t tell you what it’s like.	Manam willayta atiymanchu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
He was arrested.	Payqa hap'isqa karqan.
I don't understand why he's here.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
Many people were unhappy.	Achka runakunam mana kusisqachu karqaku.
He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
He was really quick.	Payqa chiqaptam utqaylla karqa.
If it can be reached immediately.	Sichus chaylla chayayta atinman chayqa.
And this was such a day.	Hinaspa kayqa chayna punchawmi karqa.
That’s neither better nor worse.	Chayqa manan aswan allinchu nitaq aswan mana allinchu.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
They had an idea.	Paykunaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
To be really crazy.	Chiqaptapuni loco kananpaq.
Nothing makes any sense here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas imapaqpas valenchu.
Or anything else, really.	Utaq imapas, chiqaptapuni.
He was fired last month.	Paymi qayna killa qarqusqa karqa.
I can.	Atiyman.
In fact, it usually is.	Aswanpas, yaqa llapanpim chayna.
Maybe you have a message.	Ichapas huk willakuyta qampaq kanman.
That would be another thing.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi kanman.
He can’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
He does the work for you.	Paymi qampaq chay llamkayta ruwan.
Now he knew what that thing was.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi imachus chay imapas kasqanmanta.
You’re a crazy person.	Loco runam kanki.
This did two things.	Kayqa iskay ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
Everything should be fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanan.
But it won’t always happen.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu kanqa.
He probably did it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
That’s what they want.	Chaynatam munanku.
I really don’t know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu.
In the future.	Hamuq tiempopi.
They are that good.	Paykunaqa chayna allinmi kanku.
This isn’t nearly as much as it used to be.	Kayqa manan ñawpaqpi hinachu yaqa askha.
They are so great!	¡Ancha hatunmi kanku!
That was ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I tried really hard.	Chiqaptam kallpanchakurqani.
If this isn’t there, that’s not it.	Kay mana kaptinqa, chayqa manam.
He’s good though.	Payqa allinmi ichaqa.
Tell me this.	Kayta willaway.
Not here, though.	Mana kaypichu.
Actually there was no one.	Chiqaptaqa manam pipas karqachu.
One night.	Huk tuta.
I thought tomorrow would be fine, but not yet.	Yuyarqanim paqarin allin kananta, ichaqa manaraqmi allinchu.
I mean, that’s what I mean.	Chayta niyta munani.
And the night before.	Hinaspa ñawpaq tuta.
I couldn’t do it either.	Ñuqapas manam ruwayta atirqanichu.
I mean.	Niyta munani.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin ruwaq runam karqa.
I just thought it was a bit stupid.	Chayllam piensarqani huk rato sonso kananpaq.
That’s an unfortunate thing.	Chayqa huk llakikuypaqmi.
And one of them.	Hinaspa huknin chaymanta.
He is doing his best.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinam ruwachkan.
This is not a valid statement.	Kay nisqanqa manan allinchu.
This is a great one.	Kayqa huk hatunmi.
I know that’s the case.	Chaytaqa yachanim.
This is the really difficult part.	Kaymi chiqap sasa kaq.
Where do you think that baby might be?	¿Maypitaq chay wawa kanman nispa yuyanki?
But without that.	Ichaqa mana chaywanqa.
He was mostly alone.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim sapallan karqa.
They don’t really know what they’re in for.	Paykunaqa manan allintachu yachanku ima sasachakuypi kasqankuta.
He played tennis every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi tenispi pukllaq.
I can’t sleep.	Manam puñuyta atinichu.
I have done this many times.	Achka kutitam chaytaqa ruwarqani.
It just does it.	Chaylla ruwan.
Good food, for sure.	Allin mikhuy, seguro.
They are now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi kanku.
I think that is the way to do it.	Chayna ruwana kasqanmantam piensani.
The same person.	Kikin runa.
No, he didn’t do that.	Manan, payqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It didn’t look bad.	Manam mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
He wants to win.	Payqa atipayta munan.
That was certain for a while.	Chayqa huk rato seguro karqan.
You repeat once, twice.	Huk kuti, iskay kutita yapamanta ruwanki.
I never knew anyone had done that recently.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta chayllaraq.
Don’t do that.	Ama chayta ruwaychu.
I didn’t know he would.	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwananta.
That’s not safe but better.	Chayqa manan segurochu aswanpas aswan allinmi.
It's very cold.	Ancha chiri.
Now, everyone is happy.	Kunanqa, llapa runam kusisqa kachkan.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqaptaqa manam imananpaschu.
But no, there isn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan kanchu.
Despite everything else.	Tukuy ima kaptinpas.
He is not happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
So no one will do it.	Chaymi mana pipas ruwanqachu.
He's here somewhere, and he's in trouble.	Payqa maypipas kaypi kachkan, hinaspa sasachakuypi tarikun.
I’m afraid to sleep.	Puñuyta manchakuni.
And, say .	Hinaspa, niy .
But he spoke to her sternly.	Ichaqa sinchitan paywan rimarqan.
But that’s what he did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
He is a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runan.
I wanted to make sure that was there.	Chayqa chaypi kananpaqmi seguro kayta munarqani.
No, it wasn’t.	Manan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
He knew it was true.	Payqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kasqanmanta.
Many disagreed.	Achka mana acuerdopi karqaku.
He certainly didn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
A few months, now.	Iskay kimsa killa, kunan.
I knew what you wanted.	Yacharqanim ima munasqaykita.
I don’t agree with it.	Manam acuerdopichu kani.
Can't help but be.	Mana yanapayta atinchu mana kayta.
There is no one there.	Chaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.
I never thought he would.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chaynata ruwananta.
As a player.	Pukllaq hina.
Then one weekend, nothing.	Chaymanta huk semana tukukuypi, mana imapas.
And now here he came again.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi yapamanta hamurqan.
But he knew that the world was like that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi kay pacha chhayna kasqanta.
I still have no answer.	Kunankamapas manam kutichiyta tarinichu.
Tell me more about this city.	Kay llaqtamanta astawan willaway.
He was extremely busy.	Payqa sinchi ocupasqa kasharqan.
There he lived there.	Chaypim payqa yacharqa.
This would be huge.	Kayqa hatunmi kanman.
It’s good, it’s not bad.	Allinmi, manam mana allinchu.
He knew exactly how that felt.	Payqa allintan yacharqan chay imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Maybe it’s the case.	Ichapas kanman.
He had no idea what he would do next.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imatachus qhepaman ruwananta.
Now you are really angry.	Kunanqa chiqaptam phiñasqa kachkanki.
More instant coffee.	Aswan chaylla kukata.
He was finally home!	¡Payqa qhepamanmi wasinman kasharqan!
Perhaps he did.	Yaqapaschá payqa chayta ruwarqan.
That’s all, you’re here.	Chaylla, kaypi kachkanki.
This is the best day ever.	Kay punchawqa aswan allin punchawmi.
Something really, really, really bad.	Imapas chiqap, chiqap, chiqap mana allin.
There was no talking.	Rimayqa manam karqachu.
So that shouldn't be a big deal anyway.	Chaymi chayqa mana hatun ruwaychu kanan imayna kaptinpas.
But he is .	Ichaqa payqa .
But everything went wrong.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I don't want to take this.	Kaytaqa manam hapiyta munanichu.
It was really good.	Chiqamanta allin karqa.
But he has another idea.	Ichaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi.
Beautiful summer day	Sumaq chiri punchaw
I couldn’t be ready in time.	Manam tiempollanpi listo kayta atirqanichu.
This is absurd, you know.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi, yachanki.
So very, very good.	Chaymi ancha, ancha allin.
I never noticed, but he was right.	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu, ichaqa allintam nirqa.
I was there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chaypim karqani.
Good times, yes.	Allin pacha, arí.
But he had no idea why.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imarayku chay hina kasqanmantaqa.
It wasn’t always easy.	Manam sapa kutichu facil karqa.
I never went again.	Manañam haykapipas rirqanichu.
Like, a lot of it.	Imayna, achka.
But do it.	Ichaqa ruway.
I can’t stand it!	¡Manan aguantayta atinichu!
Maybe he doesn’t want to tell.	Ichapas mana willayta munanchu.
That is not an easy thing to do.	Chayqa manan facil ruwaychu.
This could be good for you.	Kayqa allinmi kanman qampaq.
No problem there.	Mana chaypi sasachakuy.
Clearly something is wrong here.	Sut’inmi kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kashan.
He seemed serious.	Payqa serio hinam karqa.
The process had been a very long one.	Chay ruwayqa ancha unayñam karqa.
He was in a hurry.	Payqa usqhayllan kasharqan.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
He’s right there.	Payqa chaypim kachkan.
You did it this last time.	Qanmi kay qhepa kutita ruwarqanki.
What a beautiful person you are.	Ima sumaq runam kanki.
You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwachkanki.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.	Yaqa segurom kani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
If not, well don’t.	Mana chayqa, allinmi ama.
These things cannot be prevented.	Chaykunataqa manam harkayta atichwanchu.
I haven’t heard it in a long time.	Unayñan mana uyarirqanichu.
I don’t really like swimming.	Manam nadayta anchatachu munani.
If you don’t want to.	Manachus munanki chayqa.
Again he says ‘never mind’.	Yapamanta nin ‘ama hayk’aqpas imapas’ nispa.
That means a lot.	Chayqa anchatam niyta munan.
Here is what you need to do.	Kaypim kachkan imata ruwanaykipaq.
He can’t walk around.	Mana puriyta atinchu.
If so, it’s a good thing.	Chayna kaptinqa, allinmi.
You know it to be true.	Chaytaqa yachanki cheqaq kananpaqmi.
Anything could be better than this.	Kaymantaqa imapas aswan allinmi kanman.
No one had done that before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I didn’t want to do it now.	Manam kunanqa ruwayta munarqanichu.
This isn’t true though.	Kayqa manan cheqaqchu ichaqa.
There’s not much there.	Manam anchatachu chaypiqa kan.
If you think about it, this is good.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, kayqa allinmi.
He is very angry and depressed.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa, llakisqa ima tarikun.
I don’t know who you are.	Manam yachanichu pi kasqaykita.
I absolutely agree.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam acuerdopi kani.
All	Llapan
But he didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.
There’s almost nothing to do.	Yaqa mana imapas ruwanapaq kanchu.
You’re fine, too.	Qampas allinmi kachkanki.
That’s the best part.	Chayqa aswan allin kaqmi.
What do you want to find out.	Imatataq tariyta munanki.
Maybe too many times.	Ichapas ancha achka kutita.

It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.
After that, it’s.	Chay qhepamanmi.
I need it soon.	Utqayllam necesitasaq.
They know that really, really well.	Chayta yachanku chiqamanta, chiqamanta allinta.
And again and again and again.	Hinaspa yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta.
I felt like I had to be me again.	Chay hinam hukmanta ñuqa kanaypaq hina tarikurqani.
But things are never as simple as they used to be.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ñawpaqpi hina facilchu imapas kanku.
He knew what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqanta.
There was one of them.	Hukninmi karqa.
He can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.
I want to be here.	Kaypi kayta munani.
Is it right?.	¿Allinchu?.
It will never agree!	¡Manan hayk’aqpas acuerdopichu kanqa!
He is always very happy.	Payqa sapa kutim ancha kusisqa kachkan.
That would come eventually, he knew.	Chayqa qhepamanmi hamunanta, chaytan yacharqan.
I just didn’t know.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu.
He did that for her.	Payqa chayta ruwarqa paypaq.
You’re doing what you’re supposed to do.	Imatachus ruwanaykita ruwachkanki.
There is no one here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.
You're crazy.	Loco kanki.
He wasn't there this morning.	Kunan paqarin mana chaypichu karqa.
Actually, there is nothing.	Chiqaptaqa, manam imapas kanchu.
But, this whole thing is crazy.	Ichaqa, kay tukuy imapas loco.
But that didn’t last very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu chayqa karqan.
They were lucky.	Paykunaqa suerteyoqmi karqanku.
But I didn't know he was there.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu chaypi kasqanta.
Every night would be good.	Sapa tutan allin kanman.
When was it.	Hayk’aqmi karqan.
I hope you do well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Are you okay with it.	Allinchu kachkanki.
I am a reasonable person.	Ñuqaqa allin yuyayniyuq runam kani.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kanku.
He finally came through.	Payqa tukukuypi pasarqa.
And you better.	Hinaspa qam aswan allin.
It shouldn’t be here.	Manam kaypichu kanan.
So there you are.	Chaymi chaypiqa kanki.
I have to be okay.	Allinmi kanay.
Maybe it does that.	Ichapas chayta ruwan.
I get everything in there.	Tukuy imatam chaypi hapini.
But there is one thing.	Ichaqa huk kaqmi kachkan.
He doesn’t really act like one.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu huk hina ruwan.
Eventually everything was black.	Qhepamanmi tukuy imapas yana karqan.
But he knew who he was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi pi kasqanta.
I am really looking forward to this new opportunity.	Chiqaptam suyachkani kay musuq oportunidadta.
However, that doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
It’s clearly someone else.	Sut’inmi huk runa kasqanmanta.
I mean, it’s not just me.	Niyta munani, manam ñuqallachu.
I thought about that a lot.	Chaytaqa anchatam piensarqani.
I can't get caught up in something else.	Manam huk ruwaypi hapisqa kayta atiymanchu.
I don’t want anything bad.	Mana allintam munani.
This is always the best.	Kaymi sapa kuti aswan allinqa.
This is a good idea.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
The strangest thing happened yesterday.	Aswan mana riqsisqa kaqmi qayna punchaw pasarqa.
He wanted a lot of it.	Payqa achkatam munarqa.
He can’t do this.	Mana kayta ruwayta atinchu.
But it won’t be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kanqa.
I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong.	Mana imapas mana allin kananpaqmi seguro kayta munarqani.
Very many.	Ancha achka.
There is nothing better to do.	Mana imapas aswan allin ruwayqa.
But he couldn’t do what he wanted.	Ichaqa manan munasqanman hina ruwayta atirqanchu.
He didn’t talk much about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas anchatachu rimarqan.
I don’t know what he’s going to do.	Manam yachanichu ima ruwananta.
how he longed for her to return.	imaynatas kutimunanta anchata munarqan.
And he’s the one.	Hinaspa pay.
It’s not like that anymore.	Manañan chay hinachu.
I don’t understand why it would be bad.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa mana allin kananta.
I hope you do too.	Suyachkani qampas chaynata ruwanaykipaq.
Never.	Mana haykaqpas.
It’s not easy, folks.	Manam facilchu, runakuna.
And then he failed.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana atirqachu.
And the next one.	Hinaspa qatiqnin.
I’ll do this at least.	Kayta aswanpas ruwasaq.
What could be wrong with that?.	¿Imataq mana allinchu kanman?.
Who knew you had so many.	Pitaq yacharqa chayna achka kasqaykita.
It was nothing funny.	Manam imapas asikunapaq hinachu karqa.
Very, very rich.	Ancha, ancha qhapaq.
I plan to go to university.	Hatun yachay wasiman riyta yuyaykuni.
He didn’t know how bad it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna millay kasqanmanta.
Twice as many.	Iskay kuti aswan achka.
Certainly not me.	Chiqamanta mana ñuqachu.
No one can hear it.	Manam pipas uyariyta atinchu.
He had to do it quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
But it wasn’t the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
I felt like it had to be done.	Chaytaqa ruwana hinam tarikurqani.
But there is a good way to do it.	Ichaqa kanmi allin ruway.
He certainly was.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
Who knows where next week will be.	¿Pitaq yachan hamuq semana maypi kananta.
A second second.	Huk iskay kaq iskay kaq.
No, thank you!	Manan, gracias!
I mean that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi niyta munani.
This is just like now.	Kayqa kunan hinallam.
It happened very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
He smoked hungrily.	Payqa yarqaymanta cigarrota pitaq.
Go here, guys.	Kaypi riy.
Not easy, but easier.	Mana facilchu, ichaqa aswan facilmi.
Okay, so maybe not like anyone else.	Allinmi, chaymi ichapas mana pitapas hinachu.
But here it is.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkan.
I know it's bad for me.	Yachanim ñuqapaq mana allin kasqanmanta.
New to college.	Colegiopi musuq.
If you want it, let me know.	Sichus munanki chayqa, willaway.
This was not what he wanted.	Kayqa manam munasqanman hinachu karqa.
With me in the past.	Ñawpaqpi ñuqawan.
Obviously, it does.	Sut’inmi, chaytaqa ruwan.
He wasn’t good at being alone.	Payqa manan allinchu karqan sapallan kananpaq.
He has been alone for too long.	Payqa ancha unayñam sapallan kachkan.
He wanted attention.	Payqa munarqanmi qhawarisqa kayta.
It’s too good to be true.	Ancha allinmi mana chiqap kayta atinchu.
No, this wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
You are not doing very well right now.	Kunanqa manam ancha allintachu ruwachkanki.
They are the nicest.	Paykunaqa aswan sumaqmi kanku.
That’s what you did, you learned how to speak.	Chaytan ruwarqanki, imaynatataq rimayta yacharqanki.
That’s obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
That’s what I need.	Chaytan necesitasaq.
That year.	Chay wata.
But that’s him.	Ichaqa chaymi pay.
I don't know how he did it.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I think he just didn’t know what to do.	Yuyaykuni chaylla mana yacharqanchu imata ruwananta.
We are together all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kuska kanchik.
He said he seemed scared and upset.	Paymi nirqa mancharisqa hinaspa phiñasqa hina kasqanmanta.
So that’s what it is.	Chaymi chaymi kachkan.
It was cold this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi chiri kasqa.
Of course that would be bad.	Chiqamanta chay mana allin kanman.
You already knew that.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqanki.
In fact, that’s what no one does.	Chiqaptaqa, chayta mana pipas ruwaychu.
That’s why you do it.	Chayraykum chaytaqa ruwanki.
I'm kind of excited.	Ñuqaqa huk laya kusisqam kachkani.
Tell me what happened.	Willaway imakuna pasasqanmanta.
You’ll be happier.	Aswan kusisqam kanki.
I'm really trying.	Chiqaptam kallpanchakuchkani.
In the second week.	Iskay kaq semanapi.
This has been a long time now.	Kayqa unayñam kunanqa.
It was easier after that.	Chay qhepamanmi aswan facil karqan.
Or there is going to school.	Utaq kanmi escuelaman riy.
They are no longer here.	Manañam kaypichu kanku.
It was a really hard thing to do.	Chiqamanta sasa ruway karqa.
I can’t say why.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
That’s where it’s at.	Chayqa chaypim kachkan.
I can't believe this.	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atinichu.
And then the third.	Hinaspa chaymanta kimsa kaq.
Maybe he didn't really want to know.	Ichapas mana chiqaptachu yachayta munarqa.
We had to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwananchik karqa.
He was indeed exhausted.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa sayk’usqa kasharqan.
I couldn’t work.	Manam llamkayta atirqanichu.
I never thought of it that way.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa piensarqanichu.
But it wasn’t true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
They weren’t there.	Paykunaqa manan chaypichu karqanku.
He didn’t know the truth.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu cheqaq kaqta.
You are alone, outside.	Sapallanmi kanki, hawapi.
Here you are, right here.	Kaypim kachkanki.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Manam hatun ruwaychu karqa.
Many people.	Achka runakuna.
He lives in the city.	Payqa llaqtapi tiyan.
He wanted to.	Payqa munarqanmi.
But not in a hurry.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu.
And then you are.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanki.
It will be a great day.	Hatun punchawmi kanqa.
They certainly were.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa karqanku.
He wanted to do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayta ruwayta munarqan.
What, if anything, is wrong?	¿Imataq, imapas kaptinqa, mana allinchu?
He didn't get out much.	Payqa manam anchatachu lluqsirqa.
This is a wonderful thing to do.	Kayqa ancha sumaq ruwaymi.
I know things.	Yachanim imakunatapas.
It had been like this for a long time.	Unayñan kay hina kasharqan.
It’s actually quite impressive.	Chiqaptaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi.
It’s easier that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi.
Something must be wrong there.	Chaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kanan.
He is consistently doing well.	Payqa sapa kutim allinta ruwachkan.
He knows it.	Payqa yachanmi.
In fact, no one can.	Chiqaptaqa manam pipas atinmanchu.
I'm a human being.	Runa kani.
I thought the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam piensarqani.
It can’t come out well.	Mana allintachu lluqsiyta atin.
It was very serious, really.	Ancha serio karqa, chiqaptapuni.
A really hard time, actually.	Chiqap sasa pacha, chiqaptaqa.
He left the city.	Llaqtamanta lluqsirqa.
It seemed so easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi rikchakurqa.
Then he was sure.	Chaymantam payqa seguro karqa.
I've never seen one, you know.	Manam haykapipas hukta rikurqanichu, yachanki.
There he is, he is.	Chaypin payqa kashan.
I know how bad it is right now.	Yachanim kunanpacha imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
The sick one.	Unqusqa kaq.
This is my chance to be smart.	Kaymi ñuqapa chansa yachaysapa kanaypaq.
Early morning and cold.	Tutamanta pacha, chiri ima.
The right thing will come at the right time.	Allin kaqmi allin tiempopi hamunqa.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Manan, manan allinchu.
He wasn’t supposed to do that.	Manam chayta ruwananchu karqa.
He didn’t know how to deal with that reality.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chay cheqaq kaqta imayna atipananta.
But he refused to believe it.	Ichaqa manan chayta creeyta munarqanchu.
I cannot understand this.	Kaytaqa manam entiendeyta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t look at it anymore.	Manañam qawayta atirqanichu.
Tomorrow is a great day.	Paqarinmi hatun punchaw.
Maybe not that much, but that’s all.	Ichapas mana chayllachu, ichaqa chaylla.
He wants to remain anonymous.	Payqa mana sutiyuq kaytam munan.
I know what the truth is.	Yachanim ima chiqap kasqanmanta.
He wanted to be this.	Payqa kaytan munarqan.
I just thought it was funny.	Chaytaqa asikunapaq hinallam piensarqani.
It’s a really big deal.	Chiqamanta hatun ruway.
He certainly didn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
But it won’t get any better.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu kanqa.
It could have been twenty years ago.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi kanman karqan.
I thought nothing of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu.
They were too big and hard.	Paykunaqa llumpay hatun hinaspa sinchi karqaku.
There is no time left now.	Kunanqa manañam tiempo kanchu.
This happened very quickly.	Kayqa ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
I am so happy and excited for you.	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam kachkani qampaq.
But something else.	Ichaqa imapas.
And he does it.	Hinaspa ruwan.
Yeah, it was busy.	Arí, ocupasqa karqan.
It was a year ago.	Huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Nothing.	Mana imapas.
Act like a human being.	Runa hina ruway.
I'm not going anywhere now.	Kunanqa manam maymanpas risaqchu.
Where it was supposed to be.	Maypichus kanan karqa.
Everyone needs a car now!	¡Kunanqa llapa runan carrota necesitan!
Clearly this is not correct.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan allinchu.
They know that, the villains.	Chaytaqa yachanku, chay millay runakuna.
The next day.	Paqarin punchaw.
Once.	Huk kutilla.
People still want to do things.	Runakunaqa hinallam imatapas ruwayta munanku.
Maybe he couldn’t.	Ichapas mana atirqachu.
He drove away.	Payqa carronta ripurqan.
Not much of a smile.	Mana anchatachu.
Bad mistake bad.	Mana allin pantasqa mana allin.
And here it is.	Hinaspa kaypi kachkan.
That was a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
Do you disagree? 	¿Manachu acuerdopi kanki?
But that never happened.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
Anything anyone.	Imapas pipas.
Or, you know, really early.	Utaq, yachanki, chiqap temprano.
I like this one better.	Kayqa aswan allintam gustan.
That wouldn’t be a good thing!	¡Chayqa manan allinchu kanman!
I don’t see him.	Manam paytaqa rikunichu.
I can go with that.	Chaywanmi riyta atiyman.
We don’t agree.	Manam acuerdopichu kayku.
One too many.	Huk ancha achka.
He is not speaking well.	Payqa manam allintachu rimachkan.
Of course, you know better than that.	Arí, chaymantaqa aswan allintan yachanki.
Yes he was married.	Arí payqa casarasqa kasqa.
You have to do it now, actually.	Kunanmi ruwanayki, chiqaptaqa.
Then it’s installed.	Chaymantaqa churasqa.
I worry about everything.	Tukuy imamanta llakikuni.
This was really quite easy.	Kayqa chiqaptam ancha facil karqa.
I actually think he expected that.	Chiqaptaqa piensani chayta suyasqanmanta.
This was a very easy process.	Kayqa ancha facil ruwaymi karqa.
How do you do it.	Imaynatataq ruwanki.
That was extremely serious.	Chayqa sinchi hatunmi karqan.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
Instead, he spoke first.	Aswanpas paymi ñawpaqta rimarqan.
One can do this longer.	Huk runaqa aswan unayta kayta ruwanman.
In that city.	Chay llaqtapi.
I couldn’t wait for it to finally happen.	Mana suyayta atirqanichu chay tukukuypi pasananta.
He looked at her angrily.	Payqa phiñasqa qhawarisqa.
But he didn’t think of anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
It doesn't matter here.	Kaypiqa manam imananpaschu.
I was, of course.	Ñuqaqa karqani, arí.
I can't stand this anymore.	Manañam kayta aguantayta atinichu.
Strong to say the least.	Sinchi niyta.
Not today though.	Mana kunan punchawchu ichaqa.
They know everything that is available, to anyone.	Paykunaqa yachanku tukuy ima kaqta, pimanpas.
Everyone knows what he looks like.	Lliwmi yachanku imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
The next step is to do it.	Qatiqnin ruway.
But it was good to act like an adult again.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan hukmanta kuraq runa hina ruwayqa.
No one paid much attention to him.	Manan pipas anchatachu paytaqa qhawarirqan.
Everyone was terrified.	Lliwmi mancharisqa karqaku.
I’m a human being.	Ñuqaqa runam kani.
So it’s the worst.	Chaymi aswan millay.
He knows something is wrong.	Payqa yachanmi imapas mana allintachu kasqanmanta.
It was nice here.	Kaypiqa sumaqmi karqa.
I am still there today.	Kunankamapas chaypim kachkani.
If only there had been.	Sichus kanman karqan chayqa.
I don’t want to be alone.	Manam sapallay kayta munanichu.
He knows how to tell this story.	Payqa yachanmi kay willakuyta willayta.
I had never heard of it.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu.
That’s what the girl does.	Chaytaqa sipasmi ruwan.
Concerned.	Llakisqa.
He never told the truth.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas cheqaqtachu rimarqan.
Maybe you can do the same.	Ichapas qampas chayta ruwawaq.
Yeah, that’s what it does.	Arí, chaymi chayta ruwan.
I think it could be one thing.	Huk kaqmi kanman, nispaymi.
That would be ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam kanman.
Nothing is always.	Mana imapas sapa kutichu.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ichapas achka imakuna.
I know it's a good thing.	Allintam yachani.
However, maybe there isn’t.	Ichaqa, ichapas mana kanchu.
I know it will be hard at times.	Yachanim wakin kutipi sasa kananta.
He lives alone in a large house.	Huk hatun wasipi sapallan tiyan.
Everyone wants all of these things.	Tukuy chaykunataqa tukuy runam munan.
I think that's a good thing.	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
Or, really, anyone.	Utaq, chiqaptapuni, pitapas.
I wish you were here.	Munayman kaypi kasqaykita.
Nothing wrong with it, as long as you have it once.	Mana imapas mana allinchu, sichus huk kutilla chaywan kanki.
He wanted to do everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwayta munarqa.
But things are not so simple today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan chhayna facilchu imapas kashan.
I knew better.	Aswan allintam yacharqani.
It is certainly the best.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allinqa.
So that’s crazy.	Chaymi chayqa loco.
Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.	Ichapas chayqa mana chayna mana allinchu kanman.
I couldn’t talk or anything.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu nitaq imatapas.
I had to be like him.	Pay hinam kanay karqa.
He’s doing it right.	Payqa chayta ruwachkan.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
But maybe this is really good.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa chiqaptapuni allin kanman.
He looked at her.	Payta qhawarisqa.
These were good people.	Kaykunaqa allin runakunam karqaku.
That was a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi karqa.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You know you can do this again and again and again.	Yachankim kayta ruwayta atisqaykita yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta.
He is sad and angry.	Payqa llakisqa, phiñasqa ima kashan.
People like you.	Qan hina runakuna.
Everything remains the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam kachkan.
I’ve barely seen them.	Chaykunataqa yaqapaschá rikurqani.
He died three weeks later.	Payqa kinsa semana qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Faster, and faster, and faster.	Aswan utqaylla, hinaspa aswan utqaylla, hinaspa aswan utqaylla.
He couldn't wait.	Payqa manam suyayta atirqachu.
He knew everything was going to be okay.	Payqa yacharqanmi tukuy imapas allin kananta.
I actually feel comfortable here.	Chiqaptaqa kaypiqa allintam tarikuni.
He actually wanted to talk about it this time.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kay kutipi chaymanta rimayta munarqan.
This is where it happened.	Kaypim pasarqa.
But that’s the thing.	Ichaqa chay imapas.
Today was that day.	Kunan punchawmi chay punchaw karqa.
He really knows how to drive.	Payqa chiqaptam yachan carrota manejayta.
The future looks uncertain.	Hamuq tiempopiqa mana segurochu rikchakun.
This is a process.	Kayqa huk ruwaymi.
I can’t find anything to do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas tarinichu.
I’m just waiting for it.	Chayllam suyachkani.
This is a he says yes and she says no.	Kayqa huk pay nin arí hinaspa pay nin mana.
It would be wrong not to do so.	Mana allinchu kanman mana chay ruwayqa.
You can’t believe what he says.	Manan creeyta atiwaqchu chay nisqanta.
I knew it was going to happen.	Yacharqanim chayna kananta.
I don’t have an opinion.	Manam huk yuyayniyuqchu kani.
Very good about him.	Ancha allin paymanta.
Everything is not right.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu.
Once every month.	Sapa killa huk kutita.
I knew something was wrong.	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin ruway kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t get to do that.	Manam chayta ruwanaypaq chayayta atirqanichu.
I did not know where he lived at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu maypi yachasqanmanta.
He always failed.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi mana allintachu ruwaq.
I can't remember one.	Manam hukta yuyariyta atinichu.
But it was just the beginning.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi chayllaraq karqa.
And that seems right.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
You can do two words.	Iskay simita ruwawaq.
Nobody likes it.	Manan pipas gustanchu.
I think we’ve done that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I want to get out of here.	Kaymanta lluqsiyta munani.
He is now one of them.	Payqa kunanqa hukninmi.
Nothing too bad.	Mana imapas ancha mana allinchu.
There needs to be a better way to do this.	Chaypaqqa aswan allin ruwaymi kanan.
The reason for doing so is as follows.	Chayta ruwanapaq imaraykun kay hinata.
Probably more than that.	Yaqapaschá aswan achka kanman.
He didn’t want to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
I feel very surprised.	Ancha admirasqa hinam tarikuni.
He said this is how it should be.	Paymi nirqa kayna kanan nispa.
We played the game together.	Kuska pukllayta pukllaq kayku.
I've never heard the term before, but it's good enough for me.	Manam haykapipas chay simitaqa uyarirqanichu, ichaqa allinmi ñuqapaq.
We are adults here.	Kaypiqa kuraq runakunam kanchik.
Not good, great.	Mana allinchu, hatun.
It was supposed to be now.	Kunanmi kanan karqa.
Tell me where you are.	Willaway maypi kasqaykita.
I feel so uncomfortable.	Chaynatam mana allintachu sientekuni.
It was as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam karqa.
But there is no such thing.	Ichaqa manan chay hinaqa kanchu.
Who said what.	Pitaq imata nisqa.
She was a beautiful girl.	Payqa sumaq sipasmi kasqa.
He was right about that.	Payqa allintam nirqa.
I felt very angry.	Ancha phiñasqa tarikurqani.
I think that will make a great movie.	Chayqa huk hatun peliculata ruwanqa nispan yuyaykuni.
I’m not like anyone else here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas hinachu kani.
We had to do that one night.	Chaytaqa huk tutan ruwanayku karqan.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
He knows it won’t be easy.	Payqa yachanmi mana facilchu kananta.
He wasn’t ready, he wasn’t ready.	Payqa manan listochu kasqa, manan listochu kasqa.
We can never be able to.	Manam haykapipas atichwanchu.
This could be more serious.	Kayqa aswan hatunmi kanman.
I mean it’s up to you.	Niyta munani qammanta kanqa.
He refused to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu.
The process is easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi.
I’ve wanted to play this game for a long time.	Unayñan kay pukllayta pukllayta munarqani.
He was an avid swimmer.	Payqa anchatam nadaq.
I have heard a lot about this.	Kaymantaqa achkatam uyarirqani.
Only you can do that.	Qamllam chaytaqa ruwawaq.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
He later died at a local hospital.	Chay qhepamanmi chay llaqtapi kaq hospitalpi wañupurqan.
And well, one day, it happened.	Hinaspa allinmi, huk punchaw, chayna pasarqa.
But it was a good thing.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan chayqa.
He looked miserable now.	Payqa kunanqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
And boy was he good looking.	Hinaspa wayna kasqa payqa allin qhawarisqa.
Don’t do this.	Ama kayta ruwaychu.
We are very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku.
But, you know what?	Ichaqa, ¿yachankichu?
I can't believe it.	Manam' creeyta atiymanchu.
He loved to swim.	Payqa anchatan nadayta munarqan.
It was easy, the process was simple.	Chayqa facilmi karqa, chay ruwayqa manam sasachu karqa.
Above and less stated will be better.	Hawapi chaymanta aswan pisi nisqa aswan allinqa kanqa.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin karqa.
However, that is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan allinchu.
And you’re the one.	Hinaspa qamqa kanki.
Something about him seemed familiar.	Paymanta imapas riqsisqa hinam karqa.
It’s not good for him.	Paypaq mana allin.
It was very unpleasant.	Ancha mana sumaqmi karqa.
That wouldn’t have been true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman karqan.
The man was not happy.	Chay runaqa manam kusisqachu kasqa.
These types of things.	Kay laya imakuna.
New house.	Musuq wasi.
Everything else is secondary.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaqmi.
We’re all right.	Allinmi kanchik.
He was very good to me.	Payqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq karqa.
Anything would be good.	Imapas allinmi kanman.
I was never sure what he was going to do with it.	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani chaywan ima ruwananta.
He wouldn’t want to.	Mana munanmanchu.
I'm pretty sure this is it.	Yaqa segurom kani kay kasqanmanta.
Not very happy.	Mana ancha kusisqachu.
In fact, he wasn't there.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypichu karqa.
It’s going to get things done.	Chayqa imakunatapas ruwananpaqmi.
You’ll have to do better next time.	Qatiqnin kutipi aswan allinta ruwanayki kanqa.
You want to live in that house.	Chay wasipi tiyayta munanki.
That’s all you have.	Chayllam qamqa.
I never saw it today.	Manam haykapipas kunan punchawqa rikurqanichu.
One of them looked happy.	Hukninmi kusisqa rikchakurqa.
That is! 	¡Kaymi!
He can't see things very well.	Payqa manan ancha allintachu imatapas rikuyta atin.
That’s what you want.	Chayta munasqaykita.
It doesn’t matter.	Manan imananpaschu.
We can’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atichwanchu.
Obviously nothing like him.	Sut’inmi mana imapas pay hinachu.
Do whatever you want there.	Chaypi ima munasqaykita ruway.
It was a beautiful moment.	Sumaq rato karqan.
I can’t get out.	Manam lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
That would be the first time.	Chayqa kanman karqan ñawpaq kutita.
Maybe it won’t be that bad.	Ichapas mana chayna mana allinchu kanqa.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu.
And then there was the food.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa karqan mikhuy.
I've been waiting to do that for so long.	Chayna unayñam chayta ruwanaypaq suyachkani.
I want to buy a house.	Wasi rantiyta munani.
Everything has its time and place.	Tukuy imapas kanmi tiempon, maypipas.
I do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytaqa ruwani.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu.
Make it a weekend.	Huk semana tukuyta ruway.
He wanted her to be with him.	Payqa munarqa paywan kuska kananpaq.
He knows he didn't.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Yeah, we’re serious.	Arí, serio kayku.
What is it about.	Imamantataq.
He was sad there.	Chaypi llakisqa karqa.
I don’t have the time.	Manam tiempoy kanchu.
He’s a really good guy.	Payqa chiqap allin runam.
Is anyone there?	¿Pipas chaypichu kachkan?
Something like this and this.	Imapas kay hina kay hina.
It’s the best way to do it.	Aswan allin ruwaymi.
I would be fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi kayman.
I don’t like that.	Manam chaytaqa gustanchu.
But there was one thing.	Ichaqa huk kaqmi karqa.
I know exactly how he feels.	Allintam yachani imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Cold, good.	Chiri, allin.
He is bigger than me.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi.
They seemed like good people.	Paykunaqa allin runa hinam karqaku.
I don't see that.	Manam chaytaqa rikunichu.
And so here it is.	Hinaspa chayna kaypi.
He seemed angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam karqa.
I don’t know how he did it.	Manam yachanichu imayna ruwasqanmanta.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa karqan chayllaraqmi.
But no, you know, not very often.	Ichaqa manan, yachanki, manan ancha sapa kutichu.
It’s a good thing to do.	Allin ruwaymi.
No one knew his real name.	Manan pipas cheqaq sutinta yacharqanchu.
That was the third one.	Chayqa kimsa kaqmi karqa.
I’m afraid of him.	Paytaqa manchakuni.
I don’t want to see this.	Manam kayta qawayta munanichu.
It was truly his.	Cheqaqtapunin paypaq karqan.
I thought that was the way to do it.	Chayna ruwana kasqanmantam piensarqani.
But he left every night.	Ichaqa sapa tutan ripurqan.
He would have wanted it that way.	Payqa chaynatam munanman karqa.
It’s very cold here.	Kaypiqa sinchi chiri kachkan.
I ask myself again.	Yapamanta tapukuni.
You were beautiful.	Sumaqmi karqanki.
I didn’t do that thing.	Manam chay ruwaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
I can’t stop sleeping.	Mana saqiyta atiymanchu puñuyta.
What is that supposed to do.	Imataq chay ruwanan tiyan.
Alright!	Allinmi!
He felt cold.	Payqa chiri hinam tarikurqa.
No one else.	Mana pipas hukmanta.
He didn’t seem surprised.	Payqa manan admirasqa hinachu kasqa.
He couldn’t understand.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu.
I’m a new girl.	Musuq sipasmi kani.
The second is the	Iskay kaq kaq.
It was two days.	Iskay punchawmi karqa.
But first things first.	Ichaqa ñawpaq kaq imakuna ñawpaqta.
Don’t act too quickly.	Ama usqhayllachu imatapas ruway.
It really happened.	Chiqaptam chayna pasarqa.
He said it was fine.	Payqa allin kasqanmantam nirqa.
It would be easier without it.	Mana chaywanqa aswan facilchu kanman.
And then the best thing happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta aswan allin kaq pasarqa.
But he couldn't say that.	Ichaqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.
He is not happy.	Payqa manam kusisqachu kachkan.
So he had to be nothing.	Chaymi payqa mana imapas kanan karqa.
And that would be saying something.	Hinaspa chayqa imatapas niy kanman.
I hope that’s where the.	Suyachkani chaypim chay...
Actually, do that for about three years.	Chiqaptaqa, chayta ruway yaqa kimsa wata.
Again a problem.	Yapamanta huk sasachakuy.
But I want to say this.	Ichaqa kayta niyta munani.
Say, everyone.	Niy, llapa runa.
Not yet.	Manaraq.
This is a big deal.	Kayqa hatun ruwaymi.
Otherwise, it was actually pretty interesting.	Mana chayqa, chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I didn’t feel comfortable.	Manam allintachu tarikurqani.
But he did it.	Ichaqa paymi ruwarqan.
Very happy to be here.	Ancha kusisqa kaypi kasqaymanta.
But that wouldn’t be true.	Ichaqa manan chayqa cheqaqchu kanman.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
It shouldn’t be right here.	Mana allinchu kaypi kanan.
Is that what you want.	¿Chaytachu munanki.
It never exists.	Manam haykapipas kanchu.
To the big city, at least.	Hatun llaqtaman, aswanpas.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqa.
This is almost as absurd.	Kayqa yaqa chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Ultimately, he refused to comment at all.	Qhepamanmi mana imapipas rimayta munarqanchu.
It would be rich.	Qhapaq kanman.
A date not yet set.	Manaraq churasqa p’unchaw.
He said there was a lot of truth.	Paymi nirqa achka chiqap kasqanmanta.
Busy doing it.	Ocupasqa ruway.
Yes, that was a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi karqan.
Which was something else.	Imataq huk imapas karqa.
I probably wasn’t there either.	Ñuqapas manapaschá chaypichu karqani.
It still exists today.	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
You still fail.	Hinallam mana allintachu ruwanki.
You did the right thing.	Allintam ruwarqanki.
Everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
Too much trouble.	Llumpay sasachakuy.
No, it’s more beautiful.	Manan, aswan sumaqmi.
There he wasn't there.	Chaypiqa manam chaypiqa karqachu.
So that’s what happened.	Chaymi chayna karqa.
But no one knew what to do about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu chaymanta imatapas ruwaytaqa.
I’m tired of it.	Sayk’usqa kani.
I just feel ridiculous about it.	Chaymantaqa asikunapaq hinallam tarikuni.
Now you know it here.	Kunanmi kaypi yachanki.
No, she was the nicest.	Manan, payqa aswan sumaqmi karqan.
Let’s hope so.	Chaynata suyasun.
He knew what needed to be done.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna ruwana kasqanta.
I disagree with that.	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopichu kani.
He was happy to go.	Payqa kusisqam rirqa.
Maybe they know something.	Ichapas imatapas yachanku.
He’s the one.	Payqa.
But there was no time at the time.	Ichaqa manan chay tiempopiqa tiempo karqanchu.
Yesterday was a wonderful day.	Qayna punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But tell me this.	Ichaqa kayta willaway.
It will be here tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kaypi kanqa.
Once, twice, three times.	Huk kuti, iskay kuti, kimsa kuti.
So he said that.	Chaymi chaynata nirqa.
I’m really excited about it.	Chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani chaymanta.
It obviously wouldn’t have worked out there.	Chaypiqa sut’inmi mana allinchu kanman karqan.
He was right, apparently.	Payqa allinmi karqan, yaqapaschá.
That night.	Chay tuta.
No one really knows what happened.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan imachus pasasqanmanta.
It’s surprisingly difficult.	Admirakuypaqmi sasa.
Learn to say no.	Mana niyta yachay.
He did accordingly.	Chayman hinam ruwarqa.
I thought I’d do it tonight.	Kunan tuta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykurqani.
I listened to him.	Paytaqa uyarirqanim.
I am.	Ñuqam kani.
Maybe he’s sick.	Ichapas unqusqa kachkan.
It's hard to disagree with that.	Chaywanqa sasam mana acuerdopi kayqa.
Maybe the year after that.	Ichapas chaymanta wata.
He wanted that.	Payqa chaytan munarqan.
But I don’t know what they are.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imakuna kasqankuta.
There were a lot of people there.	Chaypiqa achka runakunam karqaku.
He came here yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi kayman hamurqa.
I am a very important person in this city.	Kay llaqtapiqa ancha importante runam kani.
Please let me know if this is okay with you.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway sichus kay allinchu qanwan.
I am not doing very well right now.	Kunanqa manam ancha allintachu ruwachkani.
The wrong thing to do.	Mana allinta ruway.
Are you sure you want to do that?	¿Segurochu chayta ruwayta munanki?
But he couldn’t find a solution.	Ichaqa manan allichayta tariyta atirqanchu.
No one could figure it out.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa yachayta atirqachu.
So you did it.	Chaymi qamqa ruwarqanki.
Everything was hidden.	Tukuy imapas pakasqa kasqa.
He didn’t say much to me at all.	Payqa manan anchatachu niwarqan ni imapipas.
I would be very happy if you did.	Ancha kusisqam kayman chayta ruwaptikiqa.
He didn’t speak for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu rimarqan.
I didn't agree with that.	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopichu karqani.
I didn’t think to ask him if he wanted to come.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu hamuyta munasqanmanta tapuyta.
He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imatachus ruwananta.
I doubt he is guilty.	Huchayoq kasqanmantam iskayrayani.
I really wanted to go with him.	Chiqaptam paywan riyta munarqani.
Then there’s the.	Chaymanta chaypi.
Another chance, maybe.	Huk chansa, ichapas.
I was the only one.	Ñuqallam karqani.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas mana allinchu.
But not everyone is like that.	Ichaqa manan llapa runachu chhayna.
I said to myself now.	nispaymi kunanqa nirqani.
He didn't know why he would do such a thing.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chay hinata ruwananta.
I don’t know anymore.	Manañam yachanichu.
I'm sure there are more.	Seguro kani aswan achka kasqanmanta.
Something will happen.	Imapas kanqa.
That seemed pretty good.	Chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
I thought about playing this year.	Kay wata pukllayta yuyaykurqani.
But he still couldn’t.	Ichaqa hinallam mana atirqachu.
He was ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I want to say something here.	Kaypiqa imatapas niyta munani.
I was surprised by that.	Chaywanmi admirakurqani.
They want to hear it.	Paykunaqa uyariyta munanku.
He was today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi karqa.
I know how fast it is.	Yachanim imayna utqaylla kasqanmanta.
But then there was someone.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi pipas kasqa.
I think this will be a better one for him.	Yuyaykuni kayqa huk aswan allin kanqa paypaq.
Now he knew why.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
Nothing was certain.	Manam imapas segurochu karqa.
But I’m serious.	Ichaqa serio kashani.
So many times.	Chaymi achka kutita.
He wasn't so sure.	Payqa manam chayna segurochu karqa.
And he wants to stay three hours.	Hinaspa kinsa hora qhepakuyta munan.
It has been hidden for three years.	Kimsa watañam pakasqa kachkan.
That he was wrong about something.	Imamantapas pantasqa kasqanmanta.
He never has that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa.
Here you can instantly do this or that.	Kaypiqa chayllam kayta utaq chayta ruwawaq.
But tell me.	Ichaqa willaway.
He was a handsome man.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa.
It would be like that.	Chayna kanman.
It’s good to be ready for almost anything.	Yaqa imapaqpas listo kayqa allinmi.
I really don’t want to know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta munanichu.
This was a bit of a surprise.	Kayqa huk chikan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I didn’t go to the gym.	Manam rirqanichu.
I want to be that person.	Chay runa kaytam munani.
I really didn't have time though.	Chiqaptaqa manam tiempoy karqachu ichaqa.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munanchu.
I can’t remember his name now.	Mana kunan sutinta yuyariyta atinichu.
These people want to talk to me.	Kay runakunaqa ñuqawan rimayta munanku.
But he didn’t really want to talk to anyone.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu piwanpas rimayta munarqan.
I guess that would be up to me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta kanman, nispaymi.
A teacher was there.	Huk yachachiqmi chaypi kasqa.
No really means no.	Mana chiqaptam mana niyta munan.
It’s obvious.	Sut’inmi.
That’s the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinqa.
Maybe he can do something.	Ichapas imatapas ruwanman.
He’s not as good as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu allin.
People in the university.	Hatun yachay wasipi runakuna.
He refused to study.	Payqa manan estudiayta munarqanchu.
That was the reason.	Chayqa karqan imarayku.
I don’t want to say that, this means.	Manam munanichu chay niyta, kay niyta munan.
Maybe you know about me.	Ichapas ñuqamanta yachanki.
It's been a long time, actually.	Unayñam, chiqaptaqa.
I don’t want to be serious all the time.	Manam munanichu tukuy tiempo serio kayta.
Say so and be human.	Chaynata niy hinaspa runa kay.
It didn’t get any easier than that.	Mana chaymanta aswan facilchu karqan.
But it’s nothing.	Ichaqa manan imapas.
He does a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwan.
I don’t know what will happen next.	Manam yachanichu chaymanta imakuna kananta.
I really wish it was here.	Chiqaptam munayman kaypi kananta.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ichapas huk imapas kanman.
That’s not funny.	Chayqa manan asikunapaq hinachu.
And, there will be more.	Hinaspa, aswan achka kanqa.
He was the one.	Paymi karqan.
I need money fast.	Utqaylla qullqita necesitasaq.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
He looked a little worried.	Payqa huk chhikanta llakisqa qhawarisqa.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
That seemed amazing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
In fact, everything is better for me now.	Chiqaptaqa, kunanqa tukuy imapas aswan allinmi ñuqapaq.
Do it twice a day.	Iskay kutita ruway.
That night was the worst.	Chay tutaqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
But it’s not the easiest.	Ichaqa manan aswan facilchu.
I'm crazy.	Loco kani.
I saw him here.	Paytaqa kaypim rikurqani.
It would be good now.	Kunanqa allinmi kanman.
He wanted to, yes.	Payqa munarqa, arí.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
It was a good late afternoon.	Allinmi karqa tarde tarde.
He pretty much had an idea.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim huk yuyayniyuq karqa.
I really have no way of telling you.	Chiqaptaqa manam imayna willanaypaq kanchu.
He can't swim.	Payqa manam nadayta atinchu.
There will be a snowstorm.	Chaypim kanqa.
I’m not a human being.	Manam runachu kani.
He was ready to leave.	Ripunanpaq listoña kasharqan.
Some, actually.	Wakin, chiqaptaqa.
Are you okay now?	¿Allinchu kanki kunan?
It’s amazing today.	Kunan tiempopiqa admirakuypaqmi.
Would you like to hear it?.	¿Munawaqchu uyariyta?.
We have been here a long time, a very long time.	Unayñam kaypi kachkaniku, ancha unayñam.
The reality should be.	Chiqap kaqmi chayna kanan.
But otherwise, it looks good.	Ichaqa mana chayqa, allinmi rikchakun.
Nothing seemed amiss.	Manam imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
He was a beautiful child.	Sumaq wawa kasqa.
Things would never be the same.	Imapas mana hayk’aqpas ñawpaq hinachu kanman karqan.
He still wasn't sure about that.	Payqa manaraqmi chaymantaqa segurochu kachkarqa.
He wasn't ready for that yet.	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi listochu kasqa.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan chay ruwayqa.
I couldn’t give up.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu.
Probably not.'	Manapaschá’, nispas nin.
It’s just not here.	Chaylla mana kaypichu kachkan.
Yes, that’s it.	Arí, chaymi.
You want to know more.	Astawan yachayta munanki.
And then last year was bad.	Hinaspa chaymanta qayna wata mana allinchu karqa.
It was a very difficult time.	Chay tiempopiqa sinchi sasa tiempon karqan.
I never wanted to.	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu.
Why is it so slow?	¿Imanasqataq chayna kachkan.
The world outside the world.	Kay pacha hawapi kaq pacha.
That means he's not here.	Chayqa niyta munan mana kaypichu kasqanmanta.
I hope you do that.	Suyachkani chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I am sure that is the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam seguro kani.
Like the latter.	Chay qhipa kaq hina.
I couldn't find a solution for that.	Chaypaqqa manam huk allichayta tariyta atirqanichu.
A couple of days, that's all.	Huk iskay punchaw, chaylla.
Someone is talking.	Pipas rimachkan.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
No, it isn’t.	Manan, manan chayqa.
I'm sure it would be.	Seguro kani chayna kanman.
He now knew what was going to happen.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqa imakuna pasananta.
Now don't want to say anything.	Kunanqa ama imatapas niyta munankichu.
I don't understand what the problem is.	Manam entiendenichu ima sasachakuy kasqanmantaqa.
I know that's true for me.	Yachanim ñuqapaq chayna kasqanmanta.
It was really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
Don’t do it.	Ama ruwaychu.
There is nothing like that.	Chaytaqa manam imapas kanchu.
I'm tired of being alone.	Sayk'usqañan kashani sapallay kasqaymanta.
He had barely noticed it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa qhawarisqa.
I don’t want to stop anything.	Manam imatapas harkayta munanichu.
An easy one.	Huk facil kaq.
I was that kind of girl.	Ñuqaqa chayna sipasmi karqani.
You can do that here.	Chaytaqa kaypim ruwawaq.
That was it, at least.	Chayqa karqan, aswanpas.
No one is sure what is wrong.	Manan pipas segurochu kashan imachus mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
Who was it, anyway? 	¿Pitaq kasqa?
This would be a good way to do that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi kanman kayqa.
This means that: .	Kayqa niyta munan: .
It was one of those horrible things that happened.	Chay millay pasasqanmanta hukninmi karqa.
Where are you.	Maypitaq kachkanki.
Much, much older.	Ancha, ancha kuraq.
Whatever the weather.	Ima tiempo kaptinpas.
But it’s not what he says.	Ichaqa manan nisqanman hinachu.
That actually might not be there.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa manapaschá chaypichu kanman.
He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
Now tell me more.	Kunanqa astawan willaway.
I don’t need it.	Manam necesitasaqchu.
The strong thing.	Sinchi kaq.
I soon found out why.	Pisi tiempollamantan yacharqani imarayku chayta.
Which isn’t too bad.	Imataq mana ancha mana allinchu.
I seriously doubt he’ll be back, but who knows.	Serio iskayrayani kutimunanta, ichaqa pi yachan.
Maybe you want to sit down.	Ichapas tiyayta munanki.
This was so unlike me.	Kayqa chay hinam karqa mana ñuqa hinachu.
I couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqanichu.
He came with me.	Ñoqawanmi hamurqa.
Speaking is very difficult.	Rimayqa sinchi sasam.
That’s what he wanted.	Chaytam payqa munarqa.
Both were strangers.	Iskayninkum mana riqsisqa runakuna karqaku.
It was the best summer ever.	Chayqa karqan aswan allin verano hayk’aqpas.
He doesn’t do that now.	Kunanqa manan chaytachu ruwan.
Not a very big deal.	Mana ancha hatun ruwaychu.
This statement made no sense.	Kay rimayqa manam imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
Very nice, don’t you think?.	Ancha sumaqmi, ¿manachu yuyanki?.
That’s the big thing.	Chayqa hatun kaqmi.
You do it every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaytaqa ruwanki.
Really smart, good guy.	Chiqap yachaysapa, allin runa.
Otherwise I won’t be doing this otherwise.	Mana chayqa manan kayta ruwasaqchu mana chayqa.
Is this a good thing?.	¿Allinchu kayqa?.
That was kind of funny.	Chayqa huk laya asikunapaq hinam karqa.
Not going anywhere.	Mana maymanpas rinanpaq.
I went to live with him.	Paywan tiyaq rirqani.
I don't know how to fix this.	Manam yachanichu kayta imayna allichayta.
I didn't think that was the case.	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
I am a very easygoing person.	Ñuqaqa ancha facil puriq runam kani.
He was by no means a rich man.	Payqa manan imapipas qhapaq runachu karqan.
They don’t seem scared.	Mana mancharisqa hinachu kanku.
I could barely eat for about a year after that.	Chay qhepamanmi yaqa huk wata yaqa manaña mikhuyta atirqanichu.
You can’t wait.	Manam suyayta atiwaqchu.
The worst is out there.	Aswan mana allinqa kanmi hawapi.
You have to do everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwanayki.
This is where he once lived.	Kaypim huk kutipi yacharqa.
That’s easy though.	Chayqa ichaqa facilmi.
But maybe he doesn’t know.	Ichaqa ichapas mana yachanchu.
I can’t figure out this problem.	Manam kay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I’m not going to go.	Manam risaqchu.
Like a strong cup of coffee.	Sinchi kukata hina.
So that’s a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa allin.
I don’t believe him.	Manam paytaqa creenichu.
I can’t imagine what it’s like.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imayna kasqanmanta.
That was never a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
They are both good people.	Iskayninku allin runakuna kanku.
Repeat this three times.	Kayta kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
That was always something.	Chayqa sapa kutim imapas karqa.
To the house in the city.	Llaqtapi kaq wasiman.
Everything he said made sense.	Tukuy ima nisqanqa allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I mean, really smart.	Niyta munani, chiqap yachaysapa.
He’s not doing much right now.	Payqa manan kunanqa anchatachu ruwashan.
It wants to be less.	Aswan pisi kayta munan.
But being a better person can be a challenge.	Ichaqa aswan allin runa kayqa sasa ruwaymi kanman.
Now it doesn’t matter.	Kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
But now it’s worse.	Ichaqa kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
I don’t talk to him much about it.	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu paywan riman.
Do it for someone.	Pimanpas ruway.
He was so great at it.	Payqa ancha hatunmi karqan chaypi.
I always had something to share.	Sapa kutim imapas willanaypaq karqa.
I never knew that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
And you're the thing that's bigger.	Hinaspa qam chay imapas aswan hatun kanki.
That’s a first.	Chayqa huk ñawpaq kaqmi.
Did he really give it?	¿Cheqaqtachu chayta qorqan?
Please do what you can.	Ama hina kaspa, atisqaykita ruway.
The phrase is ambiguous.	Chay rimayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
Could it be true?.	¿Cheqaqchu kanman?.
But that's about it.	Ichaqa chaymi chaymantaqa.
That was his name.	Chayqa sutinmi karqa.
And he couldn’t find it.	Hinaspa mana tariyta atirqachu.
Neither early nor late.	Ni temprano ni tarde.
The man knows how to work.	Chay runaqa llank’ayta yachan.
I couldn’t afford a new car.	Manam mosoq carrota rantiyta atirqanichu.
The man went home.	Chay runaqa wasinman rirqa.
Not a bad guy.	Mana millay runachu.
He told you what to do.	Paymi nisurqanki imata ruwanaykipaq.
Let’s hope for the best.	Allin kaqta suyasun.
For him for him.	Paypaq paypaq.
Today marks the third day of the afternoon.	Kunan punchawmi kimsa punchaw tardeta ruwan.
In fact, it’s never on time.	Aswanpas manan hayk’aqpas tiempollanpichu.
But it hardly ever happens.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa kanchu.
Maybe less.	Ichapas aswan pisi.
The more you do that, the better you’ll get at it.	Chayta astawan ruwanki chayqa, aswan allintan chayta ruwanki.
If the name is unknown.	Sutin mana riqsisqa kaptinqa.
That’s kind of strange.	Chayqa huk mana riqsisqa laya.
But it wasn’t the first time.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq kutichu karqan.
I’m glad things happened, happened.	Kusikuni imapas pasasqanmanta, pasasqanmanta.
But he always knew.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi yacharqan.
I don’t want to leave.	Manam ripuyta munanichu.
He is still doing it.	Payqa hinallam ruwachkan.
I don’t know how to describe it.	Manam yachanichu imayna willayta.
Repeat three times a week.	Semanapi kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
Absolutely!	Aswan llapan!
Almost never.	Yaqa haykapipas.
That’s what I think.	Chaytan yuyaykuni.
This is a very difficult task.	Kayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi.
That seems pretty amazing.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
But this will be good.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi kanqa.
This is the hardest problem.	Kaymi aswan sasa sasachakuy.
I really am for him.	Chiqaptam paypaq kani.
So he says.	Chaymi nin.
We’re doing well.	Allinmi kachkaniku.
he said again and again.	nispas yapamanta nisqa.
I wanted this first.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytan munarqani.
This is a new one.	Kayqa musuq kaqmi.
And a challenge.	Hinaspa huk sasachakuy.
I couldn’t do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta atirqanichu.
If he has done so.	Sichus chayta ruwarqan chayqa.
That’s great in the long run.	Chayqa ancha allinmi qhepaman.
Now, there are two types.	Kunanqa, iskay laya kan.
He says he won’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwasaqchu nispas nin.
Now be sure.	Kunanqa seguro kay.
So much easier.	Chaymi aswan facil.
Make him leave immediately.	Chaylla ripunanpaq ruway.
He still seems to be injured.	Payqa kunankamapas k’irisqa hinan kashan.
There was no way I could be sure.	Manam imapas karqachu seguro kanaypaq.
Not sure what is best.	Mana segurochu imachus aswan allin kasqanmanta.
I didn't know it was there, that it was.	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta, chayna kasqanmantaqa.
They want to be great, they want to win.	Hatun kayta munanku, atipayta munanku.
So he was kind of busy.	Chaymi payqa huk laya ocupasqa kasqa.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa munaspaqa.
He has been there many times.	Payqa achka kutitam chayman rirqa.
I think he was happy.	Kusisqa kasqanmantam piensani.
So, give it a try.	Chaymi, huk kutipi ruway.
I wish he never did.	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas ruwananta.
I don't think he really meant it.	Manam piensanichu chiqaptapuni chayta niyta munasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, it was fine.	Llakikuypaqmi, allinmi karqa.
Most of them were drunk.	Yaqa llapallankum machasqa karqaku.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Manam kaymantaqa rimayta munanichu.
He told me he spent three months in the hospital.	Paymi niwarqa kimsa killa hospitalpi kasqanmanta.
Wasn’t it a good thing.	Manachu allin karqa.
It was cold and fast.	Chiri kasqa, utqaylla puriq.
I know you are.	Yachanim kasqaykita.
The performance was good.	Ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
He said he'd rather not.	Payqa aswan allinmi mana chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
Make it yours for you.	Qanpaq qanpaq ruway.
There’s some truth to it.	Chaypiqa kanmi wakin cheqaq kaq.
I really wanted a fast car.	Anchatam munarqani utqaylla puriq carrota.
He looks a lot like her.	Payqa anchatam rikchakun.
The man was serious.	Chay runaqa serio kasqa.
I still feel that way.	Kunankamapas chaynatam sientekuni.
He knew he was in trouble, but he had hidden the money.	Payqa yacharqanmi sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta, ichaqa chay qolqetan pakasqa.
Once a month.	Killapi huk kuti.
He tried to do something.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi imata ruwananpaq.
The second is the right one.	Iskay kaqmi allin kaq.
How long ago was that.	Hayk’a unayñan chay karqan.
Then you go.	Chaymantam rinki.
The man is beautiful.	Runaqa sumaqmi.
He had no choice. 	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu. 
It was worse in the summer.	Aswan mana allinmi karqa chiri tiempopi.
Always.	Sapa kuti.
I am very proud of where I am.	Anchatam orgulloso kani maypi kasqaymanta.
Therefore, everything is wrong.	Chayraykum tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
That would be the best way to do it.	Chayna ruwaymi aswan allinqa kanman.
Please let me know if so.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway sichus chayna kaptinqa.
This is stupidity.	Kayqa sonso kaymi.
Maybe it’s too good.	Ichapas ancha allin.
And he died.	Hinan payqa wañupurqan.
If a person.	Sichus huk runa.
Yes, he noticed that.	Arí, chaytaqa repararqanmi.
There it is!	¡Chaypin kashan!
Never heard of him, no idea who he is.	Mana hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu, mana yuyayniyuqchu pi kasqanmanta.
So, that’s going to continue.	Chaymi, chayqa hinallam kanqa.
I was a miserable person.	Llakikuypaqmi karqani.
So he was happy to be there.	Chayraykum payqa kusisqa tarikurqa.
Why is it so slow?	¿Imanasqataq chayna?
But, it’s not really.	Ichaqa, manan cheqaqtachu.
He couldn’t do his thing.	Payqa manan paypaq hinaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
It looked good.	Allinmi rikchakurqa.
I knew what he liked.	Yacharqanim ima gustasqanmanta.
He couldn’t go with anyone there.	Chaypi piwanpas manam riyta atirqachu.
I never wanted to be like that.	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu.
But it was very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
These, however, are good.	Kaykunaqa ichaqa allinmi.
This is not the case.	Kayqa manam.
He was tired the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon sayk’usqa kasharqan.
He eats every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi mikun.
Always, this one time.	Sapa kuti, kay huk kutilla.
But I don’t want to make it bigger.	Ichaqa manan aswan hatun ruwayta munanichu.
That’s what he told me.	Chaynatam niwarqa.
I thought he did a terrific job.	Yuyarqanin manchay llank’ayta ruwasqanmanta.
I want more than that.	Chaymanta astawan munani.
Maybe he knows.	Ichapas payqa yachan.
But better late than never.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi tarde mana hayk’aqpas.
I don't understand why it doesn't.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa mana chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But this is a very good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
If anything, it's actually harder.	Sichus imapas, chiqaptaqa aswan sasa.
All alone.	Tukuy sapallay.
It’s not going to be like this every day.	Manam sapa punchawchu kayna kanqa.
But no, that’s not right.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan allinchu.
This is the most difficult task.	Kayqa aswan sasa ruwaymi.
!	!
It would have been more surprising if it had been.	Aswan admirakuypaqmi kanman karqa chayna kaptinqa.
Please let me know!.	¡Ama hina kaspa, willaway!.
He wasn’t where he needed to be.	Payqa manan maypichus kanan chaypichu kasharqan.
He knew why he didn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
The night was dark.	Tutaqa yana kasqa.
Now, that’s it.	Kunanqa, chaymi.
It could be a second child, maybe a third child.	Iskay kaq wawa kanman, ichapas kimsa kaq wawa.
It’s not that good.	Mana chayna allinchu.
But that wasn’t a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa mana allinchu karqan.
Known for nothing, no one, ever.	Mana imapaqpas riqsisqa, mana pipas, haykapipas.
But that would be nice.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinqa sumaqmi kanman.
I need to do this for myself.	Kaytaqa ñuqapaq ruwanay tiyan.
Everything is working fine after that.	Chay qhepamanmi tukuy imapas allinta llank’ashan.
Ten years maybe.	Chunka wata ichapas.
Probably both happened.	Yaqapaschá iskayninku pasarqa.
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
But it is still somewhere.	Ichaqa hinallam maypipas kachkan.
I don’t know what that is.	Manam yachanichu imataq chay kasqanmantaqa.
Not the absence of anything else.	Mana huk imapas mana kasqanmanta.
Maybe you should do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanayki.
He lived alone.	Payqa sapallanmi tiyaq.
Someone important was unhappy.	Pipas importante kaqmi mana kusisqachu kasqa.
The people were very angry.	Chay runakunaqa sinchita phiñasqa karqanku.
He can learn more about that this evening.	Chaymanta kunan chisi astawan yachayta atinman.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Ichapas arí, ichapas mana.
Maybe never again.	Ichapas mana haykapipas.
I’m always a constant.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutillanmi kani.
I couldn’t let him go home.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu wasiman rinanpaq.
For now, at least.	Kunankamaqa, aswanpas.
Now that’s amazing.	Kunanqa chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
And then, there was more immediately.	Hinaspa chaymanta, karqan aswan chaylla.
He had been lucky.	Payqa suerteyoqmi kasqa.
He knew he couldn't wait any longer.	Payqa yacharqanmi manaña suyayta atisqanmanta.
You are.	Qam kanki.
So, it’s very awesome.	Chaymi, ancha manchay.
And that’s what makes him.	Hinaspa chaymi payta ruwan.
I could find nothing there.	Chaypiqa manam imatapas tariyta atirqanichu.
But he certainly did.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
So, this is not really good.	Chaymi, kayqa manam chiqap allinchu.
There was no big deal.	Manam hatun ruwayqa karqachu.
It was hard, but you will succeed.	Sasam karqa, ichaqa allintam ruwanki.
I never wanted that.	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu chaytaqa.
He wants to talk.	Payqa rimayta munan.
Or maybe a day.	Utaq huk punchaw.
I don’t live there.	Manam chaypichu yachani.
What is the probability of that?	¿Imaynataq chay kanman?
It was the coldest night of the summer.	Chayqa chiri tiempopi aswan chiri tutam karqa.
I was pretty good, actually.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi karqani, chiqaptaqa.
Yes, be colder.	Arí, aswan chiri kay.
He didn’t need to ask.	Payqa manan tapuyta necesitarqanchu.
This is my guy.	Kaymi ñuqapa runa.
Could this be the case?.	¿Kaychu kanman?.
Most of the time he wanted to get out.	Yaqa llapanpim lluqsiyta munarqa.
You’re a mentally ill person.	Yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I can’t say for sure.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman.
Still, the man kept going.	Chayna kaptinpas chay runaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
They’re just that.	Paykunaqa chaylla.
So he will do that today.	Chaymi kunan punchaw chayta ruwanqa.
This is not difficult.	Kayqa manam sasachu.
I was a bad guy.	Mana allin runam karqani.
Every day, everything, you do better.	Sapa punchaw, tukuy imatapas, aswan allinta ruwanki.
He was a great man, everywhere.	Payqa hatun runam karqa, maypipas.
He can really tell a story.	Payqa chiqaptam huk willakuyta willayta atin.
That’s what I thought.	Chaynatam piensarqani.
There is no reason for it.	Manam imaraykupas kanchu.
No, that was crazy.	Manan, chayqa loco hinan karqan.
But I couldn’t stand it.	Ichaqa manan aguantayta atirqanichu.
That would be a good thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi kanman.
It would be great.	Hatunmi kanman.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Mana imamanta aswan allin, seguro.
He was so tired after this summer.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqañan kasharqan kay verano pasasqanmanta.
And that’s what I did.	Hinaspa chayta ruwarqani.
You’re a housewife.	Wasi runa kanki.
That’s all there is to it.	Chaylla kachkan.
People were happy and excited.	Runakunaqa kusisqa, kusisqa karqanku.
I didn’t have time for that.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempoy karqachu.
This seemed strange.	Kayqa mana riqsisqa hinam karqa.
When do you want this?	¿Hayk’aqmi kayta munanki?
And then again the next night.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta qatiqnin tuta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
But if you don’t know you’re doing it right.	Ichaqa sichus mana yachankichu allinta ruwasqaykita chayqa.
I think that's a great thing.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani.
Thank you thank you thank you.	Gracias gracias gracias.
Can we take a ride?	¿Atichwanchu carropi riyta?
He had to be as real as he couldn't be.	Payqa mana atisqanman hinam chiqaptapuni kanan karqa.
That was obvious early on.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan temprano.
It was a wonderful time.	Chayqa huk sumaq tiempon karqan.
That's obvious.	Chayqa sut'inmi.
To do the real work.	Chiqap llamkayta ruwanapaq.
He said it would take too long.	Paymi nirqa llumpay tiempota pasananta.
Why he did that, no one knows now.	Imarayku chayta ruwarqa, kunanqa mana pipas yachanchu.
There is a great deal to be done.	Hatun ruwaymi kan ruwana.
I want to do the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwayta munani.
But here, here was something.	Ichaqa kaypi, kaypi imapas karqa.
And boy did it look bad.	Hinaspa wayna ruwarqan mana allinta qhawarisqa.
And one day, he does.	Hinaspa huk punchaw, payqa ruwan.
Do everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allinta ruway.
He thought there would be a few people.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi pisi runakuna kananta.
But such a person.	Ichaqa chayna runa.
By now this is obvious.	Kunankamaqa sut’inmi kayqa.
I had to be something.	Imapas kanay karqa.
But it failed too often.	Ichaqa ancha sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwarqa.
There is nothing like that.	Chay hinaqa manan imapas kanchu.
So now you said it twice.	Chaymi kunanqa iskay kutita nirqanki.
I actually attended the school.	Cheqaqtapunin chay escuelaman rirqani.
Here, however.	Kaypiqa ichaqa.
I was injured.	K'irisqa karqani.
You’re second best.	Iskay kaq aswan allin kanki.
Married three years.	Kimsa wata casarasqa.
I couldn’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atirqanichu.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu chaywan ima ruwananta.
And that’s pretty big.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha hatunmi.
ME '.	ÑUQA '.
It’s a great deal.	Huk hatun ruwaymi.
You can’t imagine.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
It was the most terrible morning.	Aswan manchay paqarinmi karqan.
Man knows he knows.	Runa yachan pay yachan.
It was great to be there.	Chaypi kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But never again.	Ichaqa ama hayk’aqpas.
If they are, great.	Sichus kanku chayqa, hatunmi.
We are not intelligent.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
But you’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kanki.
One no and one no.	Huk mana huk mana.
He did it right away.	Payqa chayllam ruwarqa.
He is the nicest person.	Payqa aswan sumaq runam.
You want to know.	Yachayta munanki.
I didn’t know you could do this.	Manam yacharqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
What is the truth.	Imataq chiqap.
This is actually not too bad.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
No one realized how important it was.	Manan pipas repararqanchu ancha importante kasqanta.
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
They both agreed.	Iskayninkum acuerdopi karqaku.
It must be something new.	Musuq kaqmi kanan.
He is not a nice guy.	Payqa manam sumaq runachu.
We cannot do that yet.	Chaytaqa manaraqmi ruwayta atichwanchu.
But now, it’s not.	Ichaqa kunanqa, manan.
He's got it right.	Allinta hapisqa.
That’s a chance there.	Chayqa chaypi huk chansa.
Easy, he says.	Facil, nispas nin.
I can’t talk too long.	Manam ancha unayta rimayta atiymanchu.
He didn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
There is a reason for this.	Chaypaqqa kanmi imaraykupas.
One per year is too much.	Huk sapa wata llumpay.
That’s what happened.	Chayqa chay pasasqanmanta.
A bad month, that was.	Mana allin killa, chayqa karqan.
But he realized that he didn't want to know.	Ichaqa repararqanmi mana yachay munasqanta.
Yes, it is.	Arí, chayna.
You’re not feeling well.	Manam allinchu kachkanki.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
Can you help me?.	¿Atiwaqchu yanapayta?.
This would have been a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
You’ve done that many times.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwarqanki.
I didn’t want to be this anymore.	Manañam kayta munarqanichu.
I really don't need this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta necesitasaqchu.
I don’t want to talk.	Manam rimayta munanichu.
It can’t be done without.	Mana atinchu mana.
I need to act quickly.	Usqhayllan imatapas ruwanay.
It’s all up to you.	Tukuy imamanta qammanta kanqa.
Why not, then.	¿Imanasqataq mana.
So it’s not yet.	Chaymi manaraq.
Yeah, it’s that simple.	Arí, chay hina facilmi.
That meant a lot.	Chayqa anchatam niyta munarqa.
I feel like everyone else.	Ñoqaqa llapa runakuna hinan sientekuni.
Not always.	Mana sapa kutichu.
Great guy.	Hatun runa.
But here, this is not a bad thing.	Ichaqa kaypiqa, kayqa manam mana allinchu.
It should be easier.	Aswan facilmi kanan.
There was no time for more.	Manam tiempo karqachu aswan achka ruwanapaq.
I certainly can.	Chiqamanta atiyman.
It looked so funny.	Ancha asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
The better you are, the greater you are.	Aswan allin kaptinqa aswan hatunmi kanki.
Today is a great day.	Kunan punchawmi hatun punchaw.
The truth is the truth.	Cheqaq kaqmi cheqaq kaq.
I never wanted to go there before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayman riyta munarqanichu.
This does nothing.	Kayqa manam imatapas ruwanchu.
I doubt anything will come of it.	Iskayrayani imapas chaymanta hamunanta.
You know you want one.	Yachanki hukta munasqaykita.
But he never said much.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas anchatachu rimarqan.
He didn’t realize it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa repararqanchu.
He never does it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
No, more than that.	Manan, chaymanta aswan.
That was probably not a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
Everything in her house is great.	Wasinpi llapa imapas ancha allinmi.
I never did anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwarqanichu.
It will never be.	Manam haykapipas kanqachu.
There is no rush to react.	Manan usqhayllachu imatapas ruwanaykipaqqa.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Kaypiqa manam imapas karqachu, manam imapas karqachu.
There is something new.	Musuq kaqmi kachkan.
School night.	Yachay wasi tuta.
There were ten of them in all.	Llapallankum chunka karqaku.

He didn’t know how to get to a new city.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu mosoq llaqtaman chayayta.
This was meant to be.	Kayqa chayna kananpaqmi karqa.
It’s really stupid.	Chiqaptam sonso.
Do everything right.	Tukuy imata allinta ruway.
In the car.	Carropi.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Payqa kunan tutan paywan kayta munarqan.
Someone knows how to do that.	Pipas yachan imaynatachus chayta ruwananta.
I can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manam ruwaymanchu.
One day it passed.	Huk punchawmi pasarqa.
He seemed worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
I don’t know the language.	Manam chay simitaqa yachanichu.
There just was nothing.	Chaylla mana imapas karqachu.
That’s what happened.	Chayta pasarqa.
The sure thing.	Chay seguro kaq.
Don’t do that again.	Chaytaqa ama hukmanta ruwaychu.
I don't understand what happened tonight.	Manam entiendenichu kunan tuta pasasqanmantaqa.
Whatever anyone would want.	Imatachus pipas munanman.
It very likely was.	Ancha yaqapaschá karqan.
I think they’re happy in the end.	Yuyaykuni tukukuypi kusisqa kasqankuta.
Go right ahead.	Allinta riy.
What is it, is it.	Imataq kachkan, kachkan.
So it’s up to you.	Chaymi qammanta kanqa.
Wasn’t that the truth.	¿Manachu chayqa cheqaq kaq karqan.
I didn't realize that.	Chaytaqa manam repararqanichu.
But no one wanted that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
You don’t know his name yet.	Manaraqmi sutinta yachankichu.
So sad, but so beautiful.	Chayna llakisqa, ichaqa ancha sumaq.
There was something new there.	Chaypim imapas musuq kasqa.
But he was the one.	Ichaqa paymi karqan.
He could not comprehend what had just happened.	Chayllaraq pasasqanmantaqa manam entiendeyta atirqachu.
And food he makes.	Hinaspa mikhuy pay ruwan.
I don’t think you can ever eat enough.	Mana hayk’aqpas allinta mikhuyta atisqaykita yuyaykuni.
That shouldn’t be there.	Chayqa manan chaypichu kanan.
That may have been gone this time.	Chayqa ichapas kay kutipi manaña karqachu.
Therefore, we took three steps.	Chayraykum kimsa ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
Actually, you’re fine.	Chiqaptaqa, allinmi kachkanki.
But I just want to go to bed.	Ichaqa chaylla puñuyta munani.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
It wouldn’t have been true.	Manan cheqaqchu kanman karqan.
I didn’t want to answer.	Manam kutichiyta munarqanichu.
All, all mine.	Tukuy, tukuy ñuqapa.

He couldn’t stop her.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atirqanchu.
Do what is right for you.	Qanpaq allin kaqta ruway.
Were you really that?	¿Cheqaqtachu chay karqanki?
Who knew, he probably did.	Pitaq yacharqa, yaqapaschá yacharqa.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu.
I knew it would be good.	Yacharqanim allin kananta.
He said that it was.	Payqa chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
Something is very wrong.	Imapas ancha mana allinmi.
Given everything he’s done.	Tukuy ima ruwasqanmanta qhawarisqa.
I don’t know, anything more.	Mana yachanichu, imapas aswan.
The best way to make this dish is.	Kay mikhunata ruwanapaq aswan allinqa.
Not me, either.	Manam ñuqapas.
This is the first one.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
No one knows anything.	Manan pipas imatapas yachanchu.
You have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki tiyan.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu karqa.
I didn’t expect it.	Manam suyarqanichu.
He needs money.	Qolqetan necesitan.
I feel like a kid again.	Hukmanta wawa hinam tarikuni.
Can't find it at the moment.	Mana tariyta atinichu kunan pacha.
So it’s such a good thing.	Chaymi chayna allinpaq.
No one will do that.	Manam pipas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
It’s pretty bad right now.	Kunanqa ancha mana allinmi.
Of course, that would be one thing.	Arí, chayqa huk kaqmi kanman.
He wouldn’t do it.	Manam ruwanmanchu.
I cannot say one thing and do another.	Manam hukta niyta hinaspa hukta ruwayta atiymanchu.
Do something you’re not comfortable with.	Imapas mana allin kasqaykita ruway.
Here, there, everywhere.	Kaypi, chaypi, maypipas.
That’s not the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu.
No one can tell you.	Manan pipas willayta atinmanchu.
Clearly this is not yet true.	Sut’inmi kayqa manaraqmi cheqaqchu.
He was the first man on the moon.	Payqa killapi ñawpaq kaq runam karqa.
He wanted to walk the earth.	Payqa kay pachapi puriyta munarqa.
He probably doesn’t.	Payqa manachá chayta ruwanchu.
That’s about right.	Chayqa yaqa allinmi.
It’s the first day.	Ñawpaq p’unchaymi.
But now you’re fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi kanki.
This is the appropriate approach.	Kaymi chayman hina ruwayqa.
He knows how to do it.	Payqa yachanmi imaynatachus chayta.
Nothing is easy.	Manan imapas facilchu.
Someone was at home.	Pipas wasinpi kasqa.
Almost but not quite.	Yaqa ichaqa mana allintachu.
A week, maybe.	Huk semana, ichapas.
I am happy now.	Kunanqa kusisqam kachkani.
I didn’t see it either.	Ñuqapas manam rikurqanichu.
Sure they are safe here.	Seguro kaypi seguro kachkanku.
Someone like that.	Pipas chayna.
He wanted to tell someone.	Payqa pimanpas willayta munarqa.
I just did it right away.	Chayllaraqmi ruwarqani.
Now, hurry up!	Kunanqa, ¡usqhaylla!
I knew everything.	Tukuy imatam yacharqani.
They were nothing like that.	Paykunaqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqanku.
It’s never been like that before.	Manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
It’s like something that makes no sense.	Mana ima yuyayniyuq imapas hinam.
That was the third step.	Chayqa kimsa kaq ruwaymi karqa.
This is as it should be.	Kayqa imayna kanan hinam.
I have no idea if he will.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani sichus pay ruwanqa.
This is a huge one.	Kayqa hatunmi.
Again, be smart about how you do this.	Yapamanta, yachaysapa kay imayna kayta ruwanki chaymanta.
I, too, have thought of this before.	Ñoqapas, ñawpaqtaraqmi kayta yuyaykurqani.
Very good looking.	Ancha allin rikchayniyuq.
But you can probably do that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwawaq.
He hardly exists.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana kanchu.
He was really nice, she said.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa, nispas nin.
He could not say why he thought so.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu imarayku chay hinata yuyaykusqanmanta.
However, then .	Ichaqa, chaymanta .
Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
I think he meant it wasn't.	Yuyaykuni mana chayna kasqanmantam niyta munarqa.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
She could tell he was nervous.	Payqa repararqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
I feel a little uncomfortable.	Huk chhikanta mana allinchu sientekuni.
I don't want him.	Manam paytaqa munanichu.
I've never done that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu chayllaraq.
Not always but sometimes.	Mana sapa kutichu aswanpas wakin kuti.
This statement would be appropriate.	Kay rimayqa allinmi kanman.
But he couldn’t remember where he was.	Ichaqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
This is really bad.	Kayqa chiqap mana allinmi.
I didn’t know where to go now.	Manam yacharqanichu kunan mayman rinaypaq.
This was the case.	Kaymi karqa.
Many pipes.	Achka pipas.
Of course, they were not.	Arí, manan chay hinachu karqanku.
In fact, it doesn't really exist at all.	Chiqaptaqa manam chiqaptaqa kanchu ni imapipas.
I knew what he was going to do.	Yacharqanim ima ruwananta.
Maybe not though.	Ichapas mana ichaqa.
He would have been here.	Payqa kaypi kanman karqan.
That would be really bad.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin kanman.
Twenty months ago.	Iskay chunka killa ñawpaqta.
It was bigger than it was.	Aswan hatunmi karqa.
I never realized that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas repararqanichu.
Tell me if you want.	Willaway sichus munanki chayqa.
But it should be soon.	Ichaqa chayllam chayna kanan.
Now, he knew he would.	Kunanqa, yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
You’re not me.	Manam ñuqachu kanki.
He thought about the problem for two weeks.	Payqa iskay semanan chay sasachakuypi yuyaykurqan.
The day could have been worse.	Chay punchawqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
I get that, too.	Ñuqapas chaytam hapini.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Ichapas mana imapas kaypichu kachkan.
That was a few months ago though.	Chayqa karqan iskay kinsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi ichaqa.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
There is less humanity.	Aswan pisi runa kaymi kachkan.
Much like me.	Anchata ñuqa hina.
He wanted to be a teacher one day.	Payqa huk punchaw yachachiq kaytam munarqa.
She could tell he was serious.	Payqa repararqanmi serio kasqanmanta.
So many new people.	Chaymi achka musuq runakuna.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Ichaqa, yachanki, chayqa allinmi.
Now it's like he's never been there.	Kunanqa mana hayk'aqpas chaypi kaq hinam.
But not everything went well.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas allinchu karqan.
In fact, he still does.	Aswanpas kunankamapas chaytan ruwan.
We used to come there all the time.	Chaymanqa tukuy tiempon hamuq kayku.
Everyone agrees on that.	Chaypiqa llapallankum acuerdopi kanku.
You are a crazy person.	Qamqa loco runam kanki.
I thought it was really stupid.	Chiqap sonso kananpaqmi piensarqani.
Last month, but whatever.	Qayna killa, ichaqa imapas.
So this food thing has to be important.	Chaymi kay mikhuy imapas importante kanan.
But they are good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanku.
And they want to leave.	Hinaspa ripuyta munanku.
He went there a lot.	Chaymanqa anchatam rirqa.
That’s what you do well.	Chaytan allinta ruwanki.
I’m always there.	Sapa kutim kani.
I was very upset about what he did.	Ancha phiñasqa tarikurqani chay ruwasqanmanta.
I can’t see it now.	Mana kunan rikuyta atinichu.
Young, old.	Wayna, kuraq.
I’m feeling happy.	Kusisqam tarikuni.
It just seemed like it.	Chayllaraqmi rikchakurqa.
In other words, he is entirely right.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, payqa llapanpim allinta rimachkan.
I am very afraid of all of this.	Tukuy chaykunataqa anchatam manchakuni.
Here, again, two things happened.	Kaypi, yapamanta, iskay imakuna pasarqa.
That didn’t happen before.	Chayqa manan ñawpaqtaqa karqanchu.
And it’s going to be crazy.	Hinaspa loco kanqa.
What a terrible thing.	Imataq manchay.
That’s what he’s doing here.	Chaytan kaypi ruwashan.
This is not a bad or bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
You know this is wrong.	Yachankim kayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
Not me, of course.	Mana ñuqachu, chiqamanta.
I didn’t want to hear it anymore.	Manañam uyariyta munarqanichu.
No, no, no, no.	Mana mana mana.
But someone else got them.	Ichaqa huk runan chaykunataqa chaskirqan.
What if that’s all.	Imataq kanman sichus chaylla.
It just doesn’t sound right.	Chaylla mana allintachu uyarikun.
Here is one of them.	Kaypi hukninmi kachkan.
He knew he could do it alone.	Payqa yacharqanmi sapallan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I know this, you know this.	Kayta yachani, kayta yachanki.
But at least as a person.	Ichaqa aswanpas runa hina.
And now I am.	Hinaspa kunan ñuqa.
He!' 	Pay!'
Still, he kept doing it.	Chayna kaptinpas hinallam ruwarqa.
This is what does the work.	Kaymi llamkayta ruwan.
That was the big thing.	Chayqa hatun kaqmi karqa.
I truly feel guilty.	Cheqaqtapunin huchayoq sientekuni.
The day before.	Huk punchaw ñawpaqta.
It was bitterly cold this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi sinchi chiri karqan.
I’m glad about that.	Chaymantam kusikuni.
A new person.	Musuq runa.
How .	Imayna .
It’s just not there.	Chaylla mana chaypichu kachkan.
I’m excited too.	Ñuqapas kusisqam kachkani.
Things are right now between you and me.	Kunanqa qanwan ñoqawanqa imapas allintan kashan.
I know where he's going.	Yachanim mayman risqanmanta.
This was not going to be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanan karqa.
Some great secrets.	Wakin hatun pakasqa.
You know a lot about it.	Anchatam yachanki.
They are huge.	Paykunaqa hatun hatunmi kanku.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
That’s a foolproof thing to do.	Chayqa mana sonso ruwaymi.
If you are one, that is.	Sichus huknin kanki chayqa, chaymi.
You want to go.	Riyta munanki.
Now it’s more than ever.	Kunanqa aswan ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
So here they are again.	Chaymi kaypi yapamanta kachkanku.
Pretend it doesn’t exist.	Mana kasqanmanta hina ruway.
This is the main building.	Kaymi hatun wasi.
That’s what it’s all about.	Chayqa tukuy imamanta rimayqa.
Something else.	Huk imapas.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan.
I was tired that day.	Chay punchawmi sayk’usqa karqani.
No one can be sure.	Manan pipas seguro kayta atinmanchu.
Not here, of course.	Mana kaypichu, sut’inmi.
Both were angry and frustrated.	Iskayninkum phiñasqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa karqaku.
I just don’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
You’re doing this.	Kayta ruwachkanki.
In the process.	Chay ruwaypi.
It really is.	Chiqaptam chayna.
Not anymore.	Manaña.
This must be done in advance.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwana.
Three o’clock in the morning.	Kimsa tutamanta.
Just very sad.	Chaylla ancha llakisqa.
He wanted to get out of there.	Payqa chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqa.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan ima ruway munasqanmanta.
He couldn't stop her.	Payqa manam harkayta atirqachu.
There are not that many people there.	Chaypiqa manam chayna achka runakunaqa kanchu.
I didn’t want to know if he could do it.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu chayta ruwayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
I didn’t mean it.	Manam ñuqaqa niyta munarqanichu.
I can’t stand it.	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu.
That he couldn’t understand.	Mana entiendeyta atisqanmanta.
Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa karqan.
He certainly knew it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yacharqan.
But that was the way it had to be done.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwana karqa.
And, yes, that was me.	Hinaspa, arí, chaymi ñuqa karqani.
I said it didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu nispaymi nirqani.
You can’t do it at home.	Wasipi mana ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I wonder what he’s thinking.	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
Obviously that would have been important today.	Sut’inmi kunan tiempopi chayqa importante kanman karqan.
We did these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwarqayku.
He is not quite here.	Payqa manam allintachu kaypi kachkan.
He doesn’t have to do anything else.	Manan huk ruwaykunata ruwananchu.
No, he wasn’t like that.	Manan, payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I'm sure he is.	Seguro kani pay kasqanmanta.
Yes! 	Arí!
even if it is.	chayna kaptinpas.
This is very difficult for me.	Kayqa ancha sasa ñuqapaq.
You need to do these things regularly.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim ruwanayki.
But he can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
And now this.	Hinaspa kunan kay.
Even if it is a mistake.	Pantasqa kaptinpas.
Everyone wants a real job.	Lliwmi munanku chiqap llamkayta.
That’s pretty obvious.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi.
I don’t really know why though.	Manam yachanichu chiqaptapuni imarayku ichaqa.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam imananpaschu.
No one was with it.	Manam pipas chaywanqa karqachu.
She knew what he was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
And so far, no one can.	Hinaspa kunankamaqa, manam pipas atinmanchu.
Who lived there.	Pikuna chaypi tiyaq.
That should be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan.
He didn’t think it was good enough.	Payqa manan allin kananpaqchu yuyaykurqan.
Yes, we can’t.	Arí, manam atichwanchu.
I don’t want to do it.	Manam munanichu ruwayta.
I wonder what that looks like.	Imaynataq chay kasqanmanta tapukuni.
Something happened, something new.	Imapas pasarqa, imapas musuq.
I can’t wait for it.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu.
It doesn’t sound right.	Mana allintachu uyarikun.
This was the best part.	Kayqa aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
He was the one who wasn’t.	Paymi mana allin ruwaq kasqa.
It’s just ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinallam.
I was kind of a big deal.	Ñuqaqa huk laya hatun ruwaymi karqani.
You’re a girl.	Qamqa sipasmi kanki.
It just happened.	Chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
That was the last thing.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi karqan.
I hope this helps someone.	Suyachkani kay pitapas yanapananta.
Seriously I do.	Serio ruwani.
I still don't know much about him.	Kunankamapas manam anchatachu paymanta yachani.
They were all like that.	Llapallankum chayna karqaku.
They want it.	Paykunaqa munanku.
It was so amazing, it was amazing.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa, admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It looks new.	Musuq rikchakun.
He couldn’t stand it.	Payqa manan aguantayta atirqanchu.
I am something else.	Ñuqaqa huk imapas kani.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I don’t care about anything.	Mana imamanta llakikuni.
No, he doesn’t.	Manan, payqa manan.
We’re very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaqmi kayku.
He told me he was scared.	Niwarqa mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
There is no chance.	Manam kanchu chansa.
But that is a good thing.	Ichaqa chay ruwasqanqa allinmi.
Why is this.	Imaraykutaq kay.
So far everything is fine.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He didn’t want to leave.	Payqa manan ripuyta munarqanchu.
And second, it's not good.	Hinaspa iskay kaq, manam allinchu.
I'm not sure it will.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kananta.
You will have to do everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwanayki kanqa.
Three days passed.	Kimsa punchawmi pasarqa.
You are beautiful.	Sumaqmi kanki.
That was me three months ago.	Chayqa ñuqa karqani kimsa killa ñawpaqta.
Other than that, this does.	Huk chaymanta, kay ruwan.
You can’t see it.	Manam qawayta atiwaqchu.
No one can do it!.	¡Manan pipas atinmanchu!.
We just have to do it.	Chaylla ruwananchik tiyan.
I’m glad that’s the case.	Kusikuni chayna kasqanmanta.
He knows he can never win.	Payqa yachanmi mana hayk’aqpas atipayta atisqanmanta.
I can't do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwaymanchu.
No, he certainly was.	Manan, payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
I think they’re great.	Yuyaykuni ancha allin kasqankuta.
But there is nothing he can do about it.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu chaymantaqa.
He is right about something.	Imamantapas payqa allintam rimachkan.
So much can go wrong.	Chaymi achka mana allinchu kanman.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus pasananta.
I haven't heard anything about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas uyarirqanichu.
It hardly seems to be there.	Yaqapaschá mana chaypichu rikchakun.
He must be ready for it.	Chaypaqqa listo kanan.
It's now or never.	Kunanqa icha mana hayk'aqpas.
I very much agree.	Anchatam acuerdopi kani.
There is another way to do it.	Huk ruwaymi kan.
He can’t help it.	Payqa manan yanapayta atinchu.
No one could catch him.	Manam pipas hapiyta atirqachu.
You can't see them.	Chaykunataqa manam rikuyta atiwaqchu.
Tell me what you think.	Willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
A week passed by.	Huk semana pasarqa.
One never knows.	Huk runaqa manan hayk'aqpas yachanchu.
But the best part was.	Ichaqa aswan allinqa karqan.
He told me.	Niwarqa.
What would happen if.	¿Imataq kanman sichus.
He didn’t, of course.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu, sut’inmi.
If so, then.	Chayna kaptinqa.
He said it took time.	Paymi nirqa tiempota pasasqanmanta.
They have the same type of mindset.	Paykunaqa kikin laya yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Whatever the case may be.	Ima kaptinpas.
Someone has to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwanan tiyan.
He is happy about something.	Payqa imamantapas kusisqam kachkan.
It was so much more interesting.	Ancha aswan sumaqmi karqa.
The latter was never the worst.	Qhepa kaqmi mana hayk’aqpas aswan mana allinchu karqan.
I think it was there.	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
Of course,.	Riki,.
You’ve never done it before.	Mana hayk’aqpas ruwasqaykita.
He’ll be fine though.	Payqa allinmi kanqa ichaqa.
And then the next day.	Hinaspa chaymanta qhepa p’unchay.
She looked at him.	Payqa payta qhawarisqa.
But he had no idea where he was.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
And then, that was it for me.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chaymi ñuqapaq karqa.
We used to do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwaq kayku.
He declined to disclose his injuries.	Payqa manan k’irisqa kasqanmanta willayta munarqanchu.
I don't believe it will happen.	Manam creenichu chayna kananta.
Sure, everything would be fine.	Seguro, tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
There was one man, however.	Huk runan ichaqa karqan.
I don't know how many days it was.	Mana yachanichu hayka punchaw kasqanmanta.
This was really nice.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
I can’t say that.	Manam chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu.
Knowledge is good to fail.	Yachay allinmi mana allinta ruwayqa.
You had a good idea there a few years ago.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi karqanki chaypi iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqta.
If you want to go, go.	Riyta munanki chayqa, riy.
The process continues to this day.	Chay ruwayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
I never thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanichu.
At least that’s all.	Aswanpas chaylla.
I thought that was my responsibility.	Chayqa ñuqapa ruwanay kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I knew it was coming.	Yacharqanim hamunanta.
That was some time ago.	Chayqa karqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He didn’t seem nervous at all.	Payqa manan imapipas mancharisqa hinachu karqan.
I can’t find it.	Manam tarinichu.
I had to be faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanay karqa.
I said he was gone.	Manañam kachkan nispaymi nirqani.
Too early, too young, too fast.	Ancha temprano, ancha wayna, ancha utqaylla.
Maybe he does that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwan.
It’s just recently.	Chayllaraqmi chayllaraq.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Do it, stupid.	Ruway, sonso.
Perhaps he was wrong.	Yaqapaschá pantasqa kasqa.
And really, most not.	Hinaspa chiqap, aswan mana.
Tom is working hard.	Tomqa sinchitan llank’ashan.
She’s really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi.
He is the greatest man in the world.	Paymi kay pachapi aswan hatun runa.
Don’t do this again.	Ama yapamanta kayta ruwaychu.
I didn’t realize you were sick.	Manam repararqanichu unqusqa kasqaykita.
The man is born.	Runaqa paqarin.
But I don’t understand it.	Ichaqa manan entiendenichu.
I did something.	Imatapas ruwarqani.
You wouldn’t want to be there.	Manam chaypi kaytaqa munawaqchu.
What a beautiful thing for you.	Ima sumaqmi qampaq.
Nothing like that.	Mana imapas chaynataqa.
That’s an awful lot of people.	Chayqa manchay achka runakunam.
I didn’t want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munarqanichu.
This is neither good nor bad.	Kayqa manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
They were strangers.	Paykunaqa mana riqsisqa runam karqaku.
It’s hard to talk.	Rimayqa sasam.
There will be a lot of people there.	Chaypim achka runakuna kanqa.
Perhaps it was what he did.	Yaqapaschá ruwasqanqa karqan.
I don't want this to ever happen.	Manam munanichu kay haykapipas pasananta.
He was serious.	Payqa serio karqan.
Not a big deal here.	Mana hatun ruwaychu kaypi.
That sounds interesting.	Chayqa sumaqmi uyarikun.
But that’s not what he wants to hear.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu uyariyta munan.
That you don’t know what you know.	Chay mana yachasqaykita imachus yachasqaykita.
One was really nice.	Hukninmi chiqap sumaq karqa.
I know he’s going to get hurt.	Yachanin k’irisqa kananta.
Maybe there was something there.	Ichapas chaypi imapas karqa.
The wise man was very angry.	Chay yachaysapa runaqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
I’m doing really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwachkani.
Very nice first time.	Ancha sumaqmi ñawpaq kutita.
It was really really hard.	Chiqaptam chiqap sasa karqa.
I was very much in the mood.	Anchatam karqani.
But that wouldn’t last very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu chayqa kanman karqan.
That was the best part.	Chayqa aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
I didn't do much more than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan achkatam ruwarqani.
After that he was alone.	Chay qhepamanmi payqa sapallan kasharqan.
I’m not there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu kachkani.
That great outdoors.	Chay hatun hawapi.
I want.	Munani.
Does it sound like you?.	¿Qan hinachu uyarikun?.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
And I did just that.	Hinaspa chaynatam ruwarqani.
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
Have a go! 	¡Huk riy!
And about half of what he knows.	Hinaspa yaqa kuskan yachasqanmanta.
New.	Musuq.
But probably not for long.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana unaytachu.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
But it was very clear.	Ichaqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
This is not like you.	Kayqa manam qam hinachu.
You’re that big of a deal.	Chay hina hatunmi kanki.
So I did it.	Chaymi ñoqaqa ruwarqani.
I still don't know what it was like.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
After that he left.	Chay qhepamanmi ripurqan.
I just couldn’t do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu.
That might do the trick.	Chayqa ichapas chayta ruwanman.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin karqa.
You are a very rich man.	Ancha qhapaq runam kanki.
He says it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa nin.
He probably wanted the best for you.	Payqa yaqapaschá paymanta aswan allin kaqta qanpaq munarqan.
He’s pretty good.	Payqa allin allinmi.
You are not a nice person.	Manam sumaq runachu kanki.
Not sure if it is.	Mana segurochu kanchu sichus chayna kasqanmanta.
But there is no reason.	Ichaqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
I didn't think it would be like this.	Manam piensarqanichu kayna kananta.
He had to be quick.	Payqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
Do this one step at a time.	Chaytaqa hukmanta hukmanta ruway.
I do it every day.	Sapa punchawmi ruwani.
They’re arrested.	Paykunaqa hap’isqa kanku.
I felt happy tonight.	Kunan tutaqa kusisqam tarikurqani.
For the time being,	Kunankamaqa,
I was kind of unsure about that.	Chaymantaqa huk laya mana segurochu karqani.
I’ve never seen him.	Mana hayk’aqpas paytaqa rikurqanichu.
I know it doesn't really matter.	Yachanim mana chiqaptachu imapas kasqanmanta.
People are scared, confused or angry.	Runakunaqa mancharisqa, pantasqa utaq phiñasqa kanku.
Things are not that simple.	Imapas manam chayna facilchu.
You’re a great guy.	Hatunmi kanki.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
I am happier now.	Kunanqa aswan kusisqam kachkani.
That means, it’s better.	Chay niyta munan, aswan allinmi.
It’s good for you.	Allinmi qanpaq.
He would rather be someone else.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman huk runa kay.
But he never said anything to her.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa imatapas nirqanchu.
I don’t want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munanichu.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam chaytaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
You probably won’t do it right.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu ruwanki.
I was here.	Kaypi karqani.
But it’s fine with me.	Ichaqa allinmi ñuqawan.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
And he said so.	Hinaspa chaynata nirqa.
I couldn’t figure out who he was.	Manam pi kasqanmanta yachayta atirqanichu.
I can’t deal with that now.	Kunanqa manan chaywanqa atipayta atiymanchu.
He needs to be home for a while.	Chayta ruwananpaqqa huk tiempon wasinpi kanan.
Okay, maybe funny.	Allinmi, ichapas asikunapaq hina.
Tomorrow will be great.	Paqarinmi hatun kanqa.
Being like this.	Kay hina kay.
He couldn’t go to school for a few days after that.	Chay qhepamanmi iskay kinsa p’unchay mana escuelaman riyta atirqanchu.
I can’t understand it.	Manam entiendeyta atinichu.
How long would it take to do something different.	Hayk’a tiempon kanman huk hinata ruwanapaq.
This was one of them.	Kayqa hukninmi karqa.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
No one was there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam pipas chaypiqa karqachu.
But again, you can’t capture everything in the real world.	Ichaqa yapamanta, manan tukuy imatapas cheqaq pachapi hap’iyta atiwaqchu.
Don't you think it's better for you.	¿Manachu yuyanki aswan allin kananpaq qampaq.
He never said it, but he is certainly proud of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa nirqanchu, ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chaymanta orgulloso kashan.
Everyone was tired.	Lliwmi sayk’usqa karqanku.
I’ve seen this before.	Kaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani.
Nothing has to go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanan.
I don't care about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imananpaschu.
I know he can't.	Yachanim mana atisqanmanta.
Why is he.	¿Imaraykutaq payqa.
You want to.	Munanki.
It’s really, really crazy.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta loco.
That was my first thought.	Chaytan ñawpaqta yuyaykurqani.
Not a smart guy, but a good guy.	Mana yachaysapa runachu, aswanpas allin runa.
Do you have any idea where he can find it?	¿Ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki maypi tariyta atisqanmanta?
It was such a big deal for me.	Chayna hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
What do you want to eat today?	¿Imatataq kunan punchaw mikuyta munanki?
That’s the hardest thing to do.	Chayqa aswan sasa ruwaymi.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Allintam yacharqani ima niyta munasqanmanta.
If so, I will do well.	Chayna kaptinqa allintam ruwasaq.
That’s all we have.	Chayllam kanchik.
That’s everyone.	Chayqa llapa runan.
Nothing always, nothing really.	Mana imapas sapa kuti, mana imapas chiqap.
He says that's not the case here.	Payqa ninmi kaypiqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
If it wasn’t then maybe it was, just recently.	Sichus mana chay hinachu karqan chayqa ichapas karqan, chayllaraq.
He couldn’t remember.	Manas yuyariyta atirqachu.
You think about something.	Imapipas yuyaykunki.
In this way.	Kay hinaqa.
But this is not the point.	Ichaqa manan kaychu aswan allinqa.
I knew he would be happy.	Yacharqanim kusisqa kananta.
That’s very much.	Chayqa ancha ancha.
We really can’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam atichwanchu.
He drove home happy	Payqa kusisqa wasinman carropi rirqa
This is the big one.	Kaymi hatun.
He probably was.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
That’s a good thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi.
It doesn’t have to be any harder than that.	Manam chaymanta aswan sasachu kanan.
He said yes to it.	Payqa arí nisqa.
To perform two functions.	Iskay ruwaykunata ruwanapaq.
Like new.	Musuq hina.
He can’t remember.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atinchu.
Tell him he’s great.	Niy payqa ancha allin kasqanmanta.
And what is this? 	Hinaspa, ¿imataq kayqa?
Just to be sure.	Chaylla seguro kananpaq.
We failed with that.	Chaywanmi mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
I don't feel that way now.	Kunanqa manam chaynatachu sientekuni.
I don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
This would never be a good thing.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
And that's why he's with her.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa paywan kachkan.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
You know, you know.	Yachankichu.
I didn’t expect him to.	Manam suyarqanichu chayta ruwananta.
She couldn't understand what he meant.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imachus niyta munasqanmanta.
One never knows.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachanchu.
Something he did wrong.	Imapas millay ruwasqanmanta.
He really had no choice.	Chiqaptaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
And that’s very important.	Hinaspa chaymi ancha importante.
I really mean everything.	Chiqamanta tukuy niyta munani.
But it will be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa.
I didn’t do anything to make it happen.	Manam imatapas ruwarqanichu chayna kananpaq.
They are very beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanku.
It certainly wasn’t easy.	Chiqamanta mana facilchu karqa.
But that will be next week.	Ichaqa chayqa hamuq semanan kanqa.
It felt cold.	Chiri hinam tarikurqa.
We disagree on that.	Chaypaqqa manan acuerdopichu kayku.
You don’t want to look too big, do you?	Manam llumpay hatun rikchayniyuq kayta munankichu, ¿aw?
Tell me where it is.	Willaway maypi kasqanmanta.
It was somewhat cold last night.	Qayna tutam wakin chiri karqa.
Not for any reason.	Mana imaraykupas.
Not a big deal.	Mana hatun ruwaychu.
Everyone is an adult.	Lliwmi kuraq runakuna.
That’s how it goes.	Chaynatam rin.
This is what it’s going to be.	Kaymi kanqa.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
Maybe if that’s the case.	Ichapas chayna kaptinqa.
It’s beautiful, but sad.	Sumaqmi, ichaqa llakikuypaqmi.
He had to go there.	Chaypim rinan karqa.
Maybe it’s much, much bigger.	Ichapas aswan, aswan hatun kanman.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Man, it was beautiful.	Runa, sumaqmi karqa.
Instead, it was very interesting.	Aswanpas ancha sumaqmi karqan.
So it’s a very difficult thing to do.	Chaymi ancha sasa ruwayqa.
Where did that come from?	¿Maymantataq chay hamurqa?
He was right though.	Payqa allintam ichaqa nirqa.
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
Every month.	Sapa killa.
He's mad about it.	Payqa chaymantam loco kachkan.
But, no one knows what will happen.	Ichaqa, manan pipas yachanchu imachus pasananta.
She said yes but no.	Payqa arí ichaqa manan nirqanchu.
I wanted to know everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata yachayta munarqani.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
It won’t do well!	¡Manan allintachu ruwanqa!
It was anything but a sure thing.	Chayqa imapas karqan aswanpas seguro kaqmi.
The urgency was to do so.	Chayta usqhaylla ruwayqa karqan.
That’s been there for a long time.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.
The important thing was the people involved.	Importante kaqmi karqan chaypi kaq runakuna.
He knew it would be important.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruway ancha importante kananta.
But there is nothing.	Ichaqa manan imapas kanchu.
He can’t tell anyone how he feels.	Payqa manan pimanpas willayta atinchu imayna sientekusqanmanta.
He actually looks great.	Payqa chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
But it’s never safe.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas segurochu.
The second man was not so good.	Iskay kaq runaqa manam chayna allinchu karqa.
He knows you are here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi kasqaykita.
They were amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi paykunaqa karqaku.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munarqa.
But it was really, really great.	Ichaqa chiqap, chiqap hatunmi karqa.
I would never do that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwaymanchu.
That’s going to be a big deal.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi kanqa.
Otherwise it would be fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi kanman.
He was there, now.	Payqa chaypi kasqa, kunanqa.
I like the process.	Chay ruwayqa gustanmi.
Sick and uncomfortable.	Unqusqa hinaspa mana allin.
It has to be that way.	Chayna kanan tiyan.
Not the most difficult.	Mana aswan sasachu.
He speaks very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam riman.
I was very proud of that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso karqani.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Unayñam mana paytaqa rikunichu.
But things remained the same.	Ichaqa imapas hinallam karqa.
He goes there all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chayman rin.
Maybe he did everything.	Ichapas payqa tukuy imatapas ruwarqa.
So maybe there’s something there.	Chaymi ichapas chaypi imapas kanman.
Better yet, bad food.	Aswan allinqa mana allin mikhuy.
If so please let me know.	Sichus chay hina kanman chayqa ama hina kaspa willaway.
He didn’t mean it.	Payqa manan chayta niyta munarqanchu.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa sapallanmi.
We are very proud of that.	Chaymantam anchata orgulloso kayku.
But with that, my, my.	Ichaqa chaywanmi, ñuqapa, ñuqapa.
I agree with you there.	Chaypim qamwan acuerdopi kachkani.
You never live with me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqawanqa yachankichu.
He had no idea where he wanted to go.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu mayman riyta munasqanmanta.
A few days passed.	Iskay kimsa punchawmi pasarqa.
He was extremely lonely.	Payqa sinchi sapallanmi kasharqan.
But there is something not quite right.	Ichaqa kanmi imapas mana allintachu.
It doesn’t mean it’s good.	Mana allinchu niyta munan.
That’s amazing though.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi ichaqa.
He couldn’t see it.	Payqa manam rikuyta atirqachu.
He certainly said that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.
It can be very frustrating.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi kanman.
Really awesome stuff.	Chiqamanta manchay imakuna.
A frightened child.	Huk mancharisqa wawa.
I knew that was the case.	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Why would he do that?	¿Imanasqataq chaynata ruwanman karqa.
It could have been me that easily.	Chayna facilmi ñuqa kayman karqa.
It wouldn’t have been right.	Manan allinchu kanman karqan.
I didn’t want to see it.	Manam qawayta munarqanichu.
That was a sad experience.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
You know people aren't that stupid.	Yachankim runakunaqa mana chayna sonso kasqankuta.
More often than not.	Aswan sapa kuti.
I always seem to do this.	Sapa kutim kayta ruwaq hina kani.
He was here last year.	Payqa qayna wata kaypi karqa.
No one is a new pipe.	Mana pipas musuq pipas.
And then home,.	Hinaspa chaymanta wasi,.
The right thing to do.	Allin kaq.
They’re right there.	Paykunaqa chaypi kachkanku.
I didn’t want to say yes.	Manam arí niyta munarqanichu.
He can’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu.
I do it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwani.
But he’s not a crazy person.	Ichaqa manan loco runachu.
He didn’t look right.	Mana allintachu qhawarisqa.
He must be crazy.	Payqa loco kanan.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
I want to talk to you about that.	Chaymantam qanwan rimayta munani.
He’s good that he wants to see her again.	Payqa allinmi hukmanta rikuyta munasqanmanta.
I want to find the money.	Chay qullqita tariyta munani.
Don’t do that anymore.	Amaña chayta ruwaychu.
Not that one time, two years ago.	Mana chay huk kutita, iskay wata ñawpaqta.
He can’t be that guy.	Payqa manan chay runachu kanman.
I know what you mean.	Yachanim ima niyta munasqaykita.
This is sometimes a no-brainer.	Kayqa wakin kuti mana yuyayniyuq kaq.
I don’t mean that in a negative way.	Manam chaytaqa mana allintachu niyta munani.
And that was the last one.	Hinaspa chaymi karqan qhepa kaq.
Urgent.	Utqaylla.
About ten months, then.	Yaqa chunka killa, chaymanta.
He felt ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam tarikurqa.
We're sure it's worse.	Seguro kayku aswan mana allin kasqanmanta.
It was a new year.	Musuq wata karqa.
I couldn't sleep tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
Every morning.	Sapa paqarin.
It means something.	Imapas niyta munan.
Not too happy about him.	Mana ancha kusisqachu paymanta.
Here are two of them.	Kaypi iskay kachkan.
He wasn't quite sure what he meant.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
It is easy to see why.	Chayna kasqanmantaqa manam sasachu.
Nothing and no one.	Mana imapas nitaq pipas.
You have to do it in order to do it right.	Chaytaqa allinta ruwanaykipaqmi ruwanayki.
I'm not quite sure how to do this.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam kayta ruwanaypaq.
He couldn't understand why she felt that way.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imarayku chhayna sientekusqanmanta.
There he was, right?	Chaypim payqa karqa.
He was like most people.	Payqa yaqa llapan runakuna hinan chay hina karqan.
It was still, if you want to know.	Hinallam karqa, yachayta munaspaqa.
I can’t believe this either!	¡Ñoqapas manan kayta creeyta atiymanchu!
Yes this is what is happening today.	Arí kaymi kunan tiempopi kachkan.
It can still be.	Hinallam kanman.
I think that’s the best way to do it.	Chayqa aswan allin ruwaymi, nispan yuyaykuni.
All right, you know.	Allinmi, yachanki.
It’s not like any other though.	Manam huk hinachu ichaqa.
Or, very often, both.	Utaq, ancha achka kutipi, iskayninku.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
A man, to be very good .	Huk runa, ancha allin kananpaq .
Anyway, it didn't matter.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam imananpaschu karqa.
I wonder if he’s hungry.	Tapukuni yarqasqa kasqanmanta.
Everything happened very quickly.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
So he quit.	Chayraykum saqirqa.
Be better than this.	Kaymanta aswan allin kay.
Find out what happened to him.	Paywan imakuna pasasqanmanta yachay.
It was a cruel time.	Chayqa millay tiempon karqan.
I don’t want to be anywhere.	Manam maypipas kayta munanichu.
It’s a very nice time.	Ancha sumaq tiempon.
I mean, right?	Niyta munani, ¿riki?
And then there’s the truth.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanmi chiqap kaq.
But it’s not all true.	Ichaqa manan llapan cheqaqchu.
And so he took a chance.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa huk oportunidadta hap’irqan.
I never believe them.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa creenichu.
But it certainly does.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
He is a teacher.	Payqa yachachiqmi.
But nothing is wrong.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana allinchu.
But he did, didn't he?'	Ichaqa, chaytan ruwarqan, ¿riki?’, nispa.
I’m glad we didn’t.	Kusikuni mana chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
But it’s so familiar.	Ichaqa chayna riqsisqa.
Still, nothing is easy.	Chayna kaptinpas manam imapas chayllachu.
Maybe now was the moment.	Ichapas kunan chay rato karqa.
But this is what did it.	Ichaqa kaymi ruwarqan.
Please, please!	Ama hina kaspa!
But he isn’t.	Ichaqa manan payqa.
I know you did what you could.	Yachanim atisqaykita ruwasqaykita.
He knows you are a very busy person.	Payqa yachanmi ancha ocupasqa runa kasqaykita.
Two very different people.	Iskay ancha chikan runakuna.
You never know.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu.
It happened three times.	Kimsa kutita pasarqa.
I didn’t know his name.	Manam sutinta yacharqanichu.
I still can't believe it.	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu.
I don’t see it.	Manam rikunichu.
I thought that was the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruway kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He didn’t think straight.	Payqa mana allintachu yuyaykurqan.
You were lucky enough.	Suerteyoqmi karqanki.
No one knows for sure.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan.
No more '.	Manaña aswan '.
It’s easy to get things done.	Imakunatapas ruwayqa facilmi.
I want to swim more.	Astawan nadayta munani.
I wish it could be me.	Munaymanmi ñuqa kayman.
He had a problem here.	Payqa kaypim huk sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Not very often.	Mana ancha sapa kutichu.
I'll probably do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwasaq.
Now do it again.	Kunanqa yapamanta ruway.
I don’t need another one.	Manam hukta necesitasaqchu.
I hadn't thought about it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
That's all they were, anyway.	Chayllam karqaku, imayna kaptinpas.
And he was the one.	Hinan payqa karqan.
Discomfort is great.	Mana allin kayqa hatunmi.
And that’s not good enough.	Hinaspa chayqa manan allinchu.
Hopefully it will come soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla hamunanta.
He could have done this.	Payqa kaytan ruwayta atinman karqan.
It’s not good to be here with you.	Kaypi qanwan kayqa manan allinchu.
I’ve done it.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani.
That was a process.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi karqan.
I still don’t understand.	Kunankamapas manam entiendenichu.
I can’t seem to figure it out.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu hina.
It looked like it used to.	Ñawpaq hinam rikchakurqa.
There is nothing that man can do.	Runaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
Sure, he looks good.	Seguro, payqa allinmi rikchakun.
I don’t want to be again.	Manam munanichu yapamanta kayta.
No one knows why.	Manam pipas yachanchu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
Tell me what.	Willay imata.
I don’t see why he should be happy.	Manam rikunichu imamanta kusisqa kananta.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu.
The last thing.	Qhipa kaq ima.
He is a hidden man.	Pakasqa runam.
New Year's Eve.	Musuq wata.
We are pretty safe.	Allin segurom kachkaniku.
And there you are.	Hinaspa chaypi kachkanki.
Things will be better next week.	Hamuq semanan imapas aswan allin kanqa.
After a while he spoke.	Huk tiempo qhepamanmi payqa rimarqan.
There are no people.	Manam kanchu runakuna.
He probably shouldn't have done anything.	Yaqapaschá mana imatapas ruwanan karqachu.
That’s for sure.	Chayqa seguro.
That’s what it’s all about.	Chayta nispa.
Where were they?.	¿Maypitaq karqanku?.
Rich, successful, famous.	Qhapaq, allin ruwaq, riqsisqa.
But obviously there was someone in the house.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chay wasipi pipas kasharqan.
But we have some ideas.	Ichaqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I heard a lot of it.	Achkatam uyarirqani.
Go to this restaurant!	¡Kay mikhuy wasiman riy!
Too late, too late, too late.	Ancha tarde, ancha tarde, ancha tarde.
Not very sure.	Mana ancha segurochu.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima munasqanmanta.
I don't think he will.	Manam piensanichu chayta ruwananta.
Or you’re the one.	Utaq qam.
Everyone is there.	Tukuy chaypi kachkanku.
And it will be so.	Hinaspa chayna kanqa.
It would be better to say yes.	Aswan allinmi kanman arí niy.
No one can know.	Manan pipas yachayta atinmanchu.
So he was the one who spoke.	Chaymi payqa rimaq.
A couple times that much, in fact.	Huk iskay kuti chay achka, chiqaptaqa.
One man, however, was not present.	Huk runam ichaqa mana chaypichu karqa.
It’s good in every way.	Tukuy imapipas allinmi.
It’s like that.	Chayman rikchakun.
He is rather right.	Payqa aswan allintam rimachkan.
I've been good for twenty years.	Iskay chunka watañam allin kani.
So you know this has to be serious.	Chaymi yachanki kayqa serio kanan kasqanmanta.
This isn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu.
There may be time for that later.	Chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo kanman.
Then here it is.	Chaymanta kaypi.
He didn’t want to wait.	Payqa manan suyayta munarqanchu.
I don't know when he'll be back.	Mana yachanichu haykapi kutimunanta.
Said he had to do something.	Nisqa imapas ruwanan kasqanmanta.
A little, terrible thing.	Huk pisi, manchay imapas.
She could tell he wanted to talk more.	Payqa repararqanmi astawan rimayta munasqanmanta.
Who else.	Pitaq huk.
What a wonderful craft! 	¡Ancha sumaq ruway!
He seemed very drunk.	Payqa ancha machasqa hinam karqa.
I want to know what they are like.	Imayna kasqankuta yachayta munani.
And there you are.	Hinaspa chaypi kanki.
I couldn’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
After that, now.	Chay qhepamanmi kunanqa.
Not always, anyway.	Mana sapa kutichu, imayna kaptinpas.
I don’t think it’s going to be a big deal.	Manam yuyanichu huk hatun ruway kananta.
That’s what’s going on.	Chayqa imapas kachkan.
So, that seems right.	Chaymi, chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
In time to be taken care of by him.	Tiempopi paymanta qhawarisqa kananpaq.
If there was anything.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa.
But they weren’t in a hurry.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu karqanku.
Of course, he wasn’t alone.	Arí, manam sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwarqa.
But then, nobody does.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, manan pipas ruwanchu.
It was all set up.	Lliwmi churasqa karqa.
There is no reason to do it here.	Kaypiqa manam imaraykupas ruwanapaq kanchu.
This was the last one.	Kaymi karqan qhepa kaq.
Yes, we did that.	Arí, chaytam ruwarqayku.
What could be better!?.	¿Imataq aswan allin kanman!?.
Be as good as you are.	Qan hina allin kay.
So I mean it.	Chaymi niyta munani.
He knew all this beforehand.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi tukuy chaykunataqa yacharqa.
He says now is a bad time.	Paymi nin kunanqa mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta.
That’s the only thing that matters.	Chayllam aswan allinqa.
I’m not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kani.
He would have been hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa kanman karqan.
I really like that.	Chayqa anchatam gustan.
That’s a clear point.	Chay nisqanqa sut’inmi.
I’m furious right now.	Kunanqa sinchitan phiñasqa kashani.
He knew they were here somewhere.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypipas kaypi kasqankuta.
And he was terrified.	Hinaspa mancharisqa kasqa.
They were subsequently acquitted.	Chay qhepamanmi mana huchayoq karqanku.
It does this well.	Kayta allinta ruwan.
But then there was none.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan karqanchu.
I didn’t hear those things.	Chaykunataqa manam uyarirqanichu.
He wanted her to know that.	Chayta yachananta munarqa.
It wasn’t a good fit for that.	Chaypaqqa manam allinchu karqa.
You don’t want to be mean.	Manam millay kayta munankichu.
He does a lot of this kind of stuff.	Payqa anchatam kayna ruwaykunata ruwan.
But nobody does it.	Ichaqa manan pipas ruwanchu.
But then everything was fine.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
You knew better.	Aswan allintam yacharqanki.
But now, here you are again.	Ichaqa kunan, kaypi yapamanta kanki.
It was a great weekend.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa semana tukuyta.
I just didn’t know how or why.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynata nitaq imarayku.
I wanted to do it tonight.	Kunan tuta ruwayta munarqani.
Nothing that never happened.	Manam imapas mana haykapipas karqachu.
This is something no one likes to do.	Kayqa manam pipas ruwayqa gustanchu.
I knew it was cold.	Yacharqanim chiri kasqanmanta.
So he was disappointed.	Chayraykum hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
Actually, it’s very, very simple.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha, ancha sasam.
Tonight's night.	Kunan punchaw tuta.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
But I heard a lot.	Ichaqa achkatam uyarirqani.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
But don’t do that.	Ichaqa ama chayta ruwaychu.
You think he’s a good guy.	Payqa allin runa kananpaqmi yuyanki.

It worked remarkably well.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi allinta ruwarqa.

Okay, a couple of things.	Allinmi, huk iskay imakuna.
I really don't want to talk about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
He wouldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
That would certainly be commendable.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allinpaq qhawarisqa kanman.
He knows everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachan.
He couldn't say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atirqachu.
Thirty years ago, maybe.	Kimsa chunka wata ñawpaqta, ichapas.
Something though this.	Imapas ichaqa kay.
I hope you did well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwasqaykita.
That was the process	Chay ruwayqa karqan
And this is it.	Hinaspa kaymi.

There was nothing he could do about it.	Chayna kaptinpas manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
So it’s strong.	Chaymi sinchi.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
You said, it sure would.	Nirqanki, seguro kanman.
Would he ever be able to do that.	¿Hayk’aqllapas chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
Many people were injured.	Achka runakunam k’irisqa karqaku.

I am doing it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwachkani.
If you have to do it.	Sichus ruwanayki kanqa chayqa.

Maybe he wanted her to know that.	Ichapas chayta yachananta munarqa.
More in practice.	Astawan ruwaypi.

It’s as simple as telling someone a story.	Chayqa huk willakuyta pimanpas willay hina facilmi.
You want to report action.	Ruway willayta munanki.

He can’t do it.	Manan ruwayta atinchu.
She is scared and worried.	Payqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima kachkan.

But it has happened before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chayna pasarqa.
Do that once in a while.	Chayta huk kutita ruway.
He was really scared.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa karqa.
But this is not a good thing to do.	Ichaqa manan allin ruwaychu kayqa.
Don’t miss this opportunity!.	¡Ama kay oportunidadta qunqaychu!.
He was comfortable with that.	Payqa chaywanqa allintam tarikurqa.

And that’s what he did.	Hinaspa chayta ruwarqan.
It depends on what works for you.	Chayqa imapas qampaq allin kasqanmantam.
They are doing well.	Allinmi kachkanku.
Who did that? 	¿Pitaq chayta ruwarqa?
I don’t really know how or why it happened.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna pasasqanmanta nitaq imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I think he can.	Yuyaykuni atisqanmanta.
Yes, you are the one.	Arí, qanmi kanki.
He looked tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa.
He went to his house.	Payqa wasinman ripurqan.
Now he knew he was doing the right thing.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi allinta ruwasqanmanta.
There was some truth here.	Kaypiqa wakin chiqap kaqmi karqa.

In fact, it is useless.	Aswanpas manan imapaqpas valenchu.

He knew it was more than that.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaymanta aswan askha kasqanmanta.
They were there today.	Kunan punchawmi chaypi karqaku.

But he can’t see it.	Ichaqa manan rikuyta atinchu.

This feature is very useful for this application.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi kay ruwanapaq.
This is a great chance.	Kayqa hatun chansa.
It doesn't seem right.	Mana allintachu rikchakun.

He couldn't see her now.	Manas kunanqa rikuyta atirqachu.

Everything, he knew, was good.	Tukuy imapas, payqa yacharqa, allin kasqanmanta.
It was never going to be good.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kanan karqa.
It’s not a performance.	Manam ruwaychu.

This, he never did.	Kaytaqa, manan hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
In fact, he wants to be caught.	Aswanpas payqa munanmi hap’isqa kayta.
He had the best luck in the world.	Payqa kay pachapi aswan allin suerteyoqmi karqan.
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu karqan.

I am trying to do it right.	Chaytaqa allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.

It couldn’t have been any other way.	Manan huk hinachu kanman karqan.
I had no idea if it was the right thing to do or not.	Manam piensarqanichu chay ruway allin kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta.
It wasn’t right for him.	Manam paypaq hinachu karqa.
He does this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwan.

I am usually there three afternoons.	Yaqa llapanpim kimsa tardeta chaypi kani.
He said he never did.	Paymi nirqa mana haykapipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
They weren’t good enough.	Paykunaqa mana allinchu karqanku.
Now the most important thing.	Kunanqa aswan importante kaqmi.
But someone had to do it.	Ichaqa pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
So please do what you can.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa, atisqaykita ruway.

The coffee was black.	Kukata yana kasqa.

That's the only truth here.	Chayllam chiqap kaypi.

He’s not happy.	Manam kusisqachu.
What are you going to do in the future?	¿Imatan hamuq tiempopi ruwanki?
We can’t ignore it.	Manam mana uyariyta atichwanchu.
Not to anyone for any reason.	Mana pimanpas imaraykupas.
I'm not so sure that's the case.	Manam chayna segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
You have to do this.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan.
He gave me the money.	Paymi qullqita quwarqa.
You did something, you’ll soon find out.	Qanmi imatapas ruwarqanki, pisi tiempollamantan yachanki.
But never longer then a month.	Ichaqa ama hayk’aqpas aswan unaytachu chaymanta huk killa.

You think you’ll be happy with it.	Chaywan kusisqa kanaykita yuyanki.
That’s the important thing.	Chayqa importante kaqmi.
But then who knows.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, ¿pitaq yachan.
I can’t understand it.	Mana entiendeyta atiymanchu.
That is why this is so important.	Chayraykum kayqa ancha allinqa.
Now  .	Kunan .
This is probably somewhat important.	Kayqa yaqapaschá huk chhikanta importante.
He can't remember his name.	Payqa manam sutinta yuyariyta atinchu.
I didn’t really know how to handle it.	Manam chiqaptachu yacharqani imayna hapiyta.
You’re one of them.	Hukninmi kanki.
And then something happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta imapas pasarqa.
I wonder about that.	Chayta tapukuni.
You don’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachankichu.
No, it’s not someone else.	Manan, manan huk runachu.
I'm really excited, actually.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani, chiqaptaqa.

I was just so excited.	Chayllam ancha kusisqa karqani.
He’s that good, people.	Payqa chayna allinmi, runakuna.
And it’s not good.	Hinaspa mana allinchu.
He certainly said no.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana nirqanchu.
I'll be there.	Chaypim kasaq.
So, that would mean everyone.	Chaymi, chayqa llapa runa niyta munanman.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan ñawpaqtaqa.
I don’t want to hear about this anymore.	Kaymantaqa manañam uyariyta munanichu.

But they were there.	Ichaqa chaypim karqaku.

He wanted to be alone.	Payqa sapallan kaytan munarqan.
So here it is today.	Chaymi kunan punchaw kaypi kachkan.
I was fine there.	Chaypiqa allinmi karqani.
I know that sounds crazy.	Yachanim chayqa loco hina uyarikun.
He seemed a little nervous.	Payqa huk chikan mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He doesn’t want to talk to me.	Payqa manan munanchu ñoqawan rimayta.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really meant it too.	Ñuqapas chiqaptam chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
Don't be too sure though.	Ama ancha segurochu ichaqa.
No surprise there.	Mana admirakuypaqmi chaypiqa.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
It won't work here.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanqa.
I was exhausted too.	Ñoqapas sayk’usqañan karqani.
That’s what she said he said.	Chaytan payqa nisqa payqa nisqa.
A treat to a weary city.	Sayk’usqa llaqtaman huk mikhuy.
Maybe he couldn’t stand it himself.	Ichapas pay kikin mana aguantayta atirqachu.
Not sure why.	Mana segurochu imarayku.
This very night.	Kay kikin tuta.
I couldn't sleep last night.	Qayna tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
And those people agreed.	Hinaspa chay runakunaqa chaywan acuerdopi karqanku.

I don’t want anyone to know, really.	Manam munanichu pipas yachananta, chiqaptaqa.
They were so great to me.	Paykunaqa ancha hatunmi karqaku ñuqapaq.
I really had no choice.	Chiqaptaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Is it a good idea to do that?.	¿Allinchu chay ruwayqa kanman?.
For being here.	Kaypi kasqaymanta.
Throughout the house.	Tukuy wasipi.
He wasn’t like he was last week.	Payqa manan qayna semana hinachu karqan.
She noticed it was cold.	Payqa repararqanmi chiri kasqanmanta.
Things were very wrong in the city.	Chay llaqtapiqa imapas sinchi mana allinmi karqa.
There are people who live there.	Chaypi tiyaq runakunaqa kanku.
She looked so nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
I didn’t do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwarqanichu.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
It was a dark night.	Yana tutam kasqa.
Maybe a little too much.	Ichapas huk chikan llumpayta.
If it looks fast, it’s fast.	Sichus usqhaylla rikch’akun chayqa, usqhayllan.
So that’s what it’s like.	Chaymi chayna kanman.
So, that was a good thing.	Chaymi, chayqa allinmi karqa.
I’ll do that if I want to.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq munaspaqa.
But this really doesn’t mean much.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kayqa manan anchatachu niyta munan.
You know when.	Yachanki haykapi.
I can’t be that smart.	Manam chayna yachaysapa kayta atiymanchu.
I'm sure that	Seguro kani chay

Again and again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
But he was expelled.	Ichaqa qarqosqa karqan.
One person can.	Huk runam atin.
He was very, very fast.	Payqa ancha, ancha utqayllam karqa.
Both were really good.	Iskayninkum chiqap allin karqaku.
I don’t want to be here.	Manam kaypi kayta munanichu.
I'll do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwasaq.
I'll keep doing it.	Hinallam ruwasaq.
So tell the whole story.	Chaymi tukuy willakuyta willay.
He wasn’t sure himself.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa pay kikin.
I want to be beautiful.	Munani sumaq kayta.
So we lived there.	Chaymi chaypi tiyaq kayku.
He left it to her.	Payqa saqirqa.

This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.
You, I didn’t do this.	Qamqa, manam ñuqachu kaytaqa ruwarqani.
I thought that was really funny.	Chayqa chiqap asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
She was so beautiful now.	Payqa kunanqa ancha sumaqmi kasqa.
Further.	Aswan.
But he didn’t really appreciate it.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa allinpaq qhawarirqan.
I really thought he was caught.	Chiqaptam piensarqani pay hapisqa kasqanmanta.
I would love to hear about this.	Kaymanta uyariyta anchata munani.
For some reason that didn’t work.	Imaraykupas chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
But obviously you should.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanayki.
We may not be able to fix it.	Manapaschá allichayta atichwanchu.
He got in trouble last year, he said.	Qayna wata sasachakuypi tarikurqa, nispa.
He was married three times.	Kimsa kutitam casarasqa karqan.
I wasn’t sure which one it was.	Manam segurochu karqani mayqin kasqanmantaqa.
I meant one of them.	Hukninmi niyta munarqani.
He never wanted that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Maybe.	Icha.
I could never know.	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu.
I don't care how bad it is.	Manam imananpaschu imayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
They are ridiculous people.	Paykunaqa asikunapaq hina runakunam.
It’s better that way.	Aswan allinmi chay hinaqa.
I was very very, very wrong.	Ancha ancha, ancha pantasqa karqani.
Things could be worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman imapas.
I know, it’s smart.	Yachanim, yachaysapa.
That’s part of what happens here.	Chayqa kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta hukninmi.

And this was just that.	Hinaspa kayqa chaylla karqa.
Find out what happened and where.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta hinaspa maypi kasqanmanta yachay.
The faster the better.	Aswan utqaylla kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Everything is wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
Unfortunately, it always is.	Llakikuypaqmi, sapa kutim chayna.
You probably won’t.	Yaqapaschá mana chaytachu ruwanki.
That’s probably it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
It’s not really bad.	Manam chiqap mana allinchu.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Manam chayna segurochu kani tukuy imamanta.
He doesn’t want to come.	Payqa manam hamuyta munanchu.
But then again maybe not.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta ichapas mana.
I've been doing that for a few years.	Chaytaqa iskay kimsa watañam ruwachkani.
She has been married twice.	Payqa iskay kutitan casarasqa kashan.
That was always there.	Chayqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
I can’t speak anymore.	Manañam rimayta atinichu.
It doesn’t mean you’re not good enough.	Manam niyta munanchu mana allinchu kasqaykita.
But then again, he was drunk.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, payqa machasqa kasqa.
That’s the biggest thing.	Chayqa aswan hatun kaqmi.
He left quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ripurqan.
He could not understand the language.	Payqa manan chay simita entiendeyta atirqanchu.
I actually know this.	Chiqaptaqa kaytam yachani.
It’s in the house somewhere.	Maypipas wasipi kachkan.
He doesn’t know that.	Payqa manan yachanchu chaytaqa.
I didn't think much of it.	Chaypiqa manam anchatachu piensarqani.
When he is depressed, he does not eat regularly.	Llakisqa kaptinqa manam sapa kutichu mikun.
You can't do anything with it.	Chaywanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
It will be strong.	Sinchi kanqa.
He better be ready.	Payqa aswan allinmi listo kay.
Of course, you don't know what time this is.	Arí, manam yachankichu mayqin hora kayqa kasqanmanta.
I don’t really want to talk about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymanta rimayta munani.
So he left her to his own devices.	Chaymi paytaqa munasqanman hina saqirqa.
He’s listening.	Payqa uyarikun.
Don’t be that person.	Ama chay runa kaychu.
But they are not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu kashanku.

I’m afraid that’s not the case.	Manchakuni mana chayna kasqanmanta.

I’m afraid that’s the problem.	Manchakuni chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Maybe it was more important.	Ichapas aswan importante karqa.
So it’s there.	Chaymi chaypi kachkan.
Repeat several times.	Achka kutita yapamanta ruway.
But I don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu.
He always had a great sense of humor.	Payqa sapa kutim ancha allin yuyayniyuq karqa.
Don’t pretend anyone ever did.	Ama hayk’aqpas pipas chayta ruwaq hinachu.
Even if it’s not very good.	Manaña ancha allinchu kaptinpas.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
He loved being outdoors.	Payqa anchatan munarqan hawapi kayta.
I don’t want to do that again either.	Ñoqapas manan hukmanta chayta ruwayta munanichu.
I don’t know how to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta yachanichu.
This is a good thing for me.	Kayqa allinmi ñuqapaq.
It really, really means it.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta niyta munan.
He’s never on time.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas tiempollanpichu.
Which is more important.	Imataq aswan importante.
You said that earlier.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaytan nirqanki.
I can’t really say yet.	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu.
He knew nothing of what had happened to him.	Payqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu paywan imachus pasasqanmanta.
If only there were more like him.	Sichus pay hina aswan askha kanman karqan chayqa.
And he was expelled.	Hinan payqa qarqosqa karqan.
Unfortunately, he's right.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa allintam riman.
And that’s what he’s doing.	Hinaspa chayta ruwachkan.
I have a very positive attitude.	Ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
But he didn’t exactly say no.	Ichaqa manan allintachu nirqan mana nispa.
Thank you, that’s great.	Gracias, chayqa ancha allinmi.
This guy wants something.	Kay runaqa imatapas munan.
This is either nothing.	Kayqa icha mana imapas.
This is so quick.	Kayqa chayna utqaylla.
Thirdly, the	Kimsa kaq.
The night walker.	Tuta puriq.
Everyone knows you're here and they know the real story.	Lliwmi yachanku kaypi kasqaykita hinaspa chiqap willakuyta yachanku.
But he kept saying it.	Ichaqa hinallam nirqa.
If anything.	Sichus imapas.
How long had it been.	Hayk’a unayñan karqan.
It never was.	Manam haykapipas karqachu.
I’ve never heard of it.	Mana hayk’aqpas uyarirqanichu.
I was one of them.	Hukninmi karqani.
Thus  .	Kayna .
He wants to win immediately.	Payqa chayllam atipayta munan.
This means two things.	Kayqa iskay ima niyta munan.
But he wanted to know.	Ichaqa yachayta munarqa.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.
To be successful, you have to be successful.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqqa allintam ruwanayki.
And then it goes.	Hinaspa chaymanta rin.
But that would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
One person was injured.	Huk runan k’irisqa karqan.
He thought about it better.	Chaytaqa aswan allintan yuyaykurqan.
But it won’t be easy to agree.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa acuerdopi kayqa.
I did the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaytam ruwarqani.
I don't know when that happened.	Manam yachanichu haykapi chayna kasqanmantaqa.
We’re so good together.	Ancha allinmi kuska kayku.
A young man.	Huk wayna.
It’s like new.	Musuq hinam.
How am I in it.	Imaynataq ñuqa chaypi kachkani.
He had no idea what to do about it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imatachus chaymanta ruwananta.
I can wait for it.	Suyayta atiyman.
Very good for you.	Ancha allin qampaq.
There were people there.	Chaypin runakuna karqan.
He is just like you and me.	Payqa qampas ñuqapas hinam.
I don’t want to hear about it.	Manam chaymanta uyariyta munanichu.
Never forget that.	Chaytaqa ama haykapipas qunqaychu.
Where is the restaurant?	¿Maypitaq chay mikhuy wasi kachkan?
I can't see that.	Chaytaqa manam qawayta atiymanchu.
He eats with it.	Chaywanmi mikun.
But it was cold.	Ichaqa chiri kasqa.
I don’t feel comfortable.	Manam allinchu tarikuni.
He didn’t want to hear this.	Kaytaqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu.
But that’s that.	Ichaqa chay chayta.
I was the only one in the car.	Ñuqallam carropi karqa.
It didn’t come easy.	Manam facilchu hamurqa.
You know, it’s really nice here.	Yachanki, kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.
All.	Llapan.
I don’t like him.	Manam paytaqa gustanchu.
Please? 	Ama hina?
Tell me why you’re here.	Willaway imanasqa kaypi kasqaykita.
He said he wasn’t quite sure.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kashasqanmanta nisqa.
I’d love to know what you think.	Anchatan munani yachayta ima yuyaykusqaykita.
So many things could have gone wrong.	Chaymi achka imapas mana allinchu kanman karqa.
I didn’t notice it.	Manam repararqanichu.
There was no one.	Manam pipas karqachu.
He doesn't want to talk.	Manam rimayta munanchu.
You don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachankichu.
Or, well, it’s.	Utaq, allinmi.
Faster, faster.	Aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla.
He says something, she says something.	Payqa imatapas nin, payqa imatapas nin.
Tell the story.	Chay willakuyta willay.
That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
He wanted her to do it.	Payqa munarqanmi chayta ruwananta.
Maybe that’s what happened here.	Ichapas chayna kaypi pasarqa.
That’s what he looked at.	Chayqa qhawarisqa.
I don’t want to be married.	Manam munanichu casarasqa kayta.
I look forward to doing that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi anchata suyachkani.
This was a very impressive experience.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I never expected today to be so hard.	Mana hayk’aqpas suyarqanichu kunan p’unchay chhayna sasa kananta.
He was tired and wanted to sleep.	Sayk’usqa kaspa puñuyta munarqa.
Other household items.	Huk wasipi kaq imakuna.
Make what you want out of this.	Kaymanta ima munasqaykita ruway.
I had no idea how he knew that.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imaynata chayta yachasqanmanta.
I didn’t see more action.	Mana aswan ruwaykunata rikurqanichu.
This doesn't sound right.	Kayqa manam allintachu uyarikun.
But the success didn’t come easily.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chay allin ruwayqa hamurqan.
Success came quickly.	Allin ruwayqa usqhayllan hamurqan.
He always wants to play.	Payqa sapa kutim pukllayta munan.
That would have been better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
But I don’t know for sure.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani.
I think someone else said it better.	Yuyaykuni huk runa aswan allinta nisqa.
I may or may not agree.	Ichapas manapaschá acuerdopichu kani.
How do you do this?	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwanki?
That’s a sad thing.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi.
Then he went out.	Chaymantam lluqsirqa.
But now he was sure.	Ichaqa kunanmi seguro kasqa.
He should be happy.	Payqa kusisqam kanan.
I hear everything.	Tukuy imatam uyarini.
I am much better now.	Kunanqa ancha allinmi kani.
It’s fine with me anyway.	Allinmi ñuqawanqa imayna kaptinpas.
And that’s a bad thing.	Hinaspa chayqa mana allinmi.
This will not do.	Kayqa manam ruwanqachu.
Maybe once in a while.	Ichapas huk kutipi.
This is true most of the time but not always.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim chiqap ichaqa manam sapa kutichu.
I usually don't really care about that.	Yaqa llapanpim chaymantaqa mana anchatachu llakikuni.
I didn’t know they were there.	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqankuta.
This is a tough one.	Kayqa sinchi sasa kaqmi.
I was fired.	Ñoqaqa qarqosqa karqani.
He had no idea how he knew that.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatas chayta yacharqan chayta.
And then the world.	Hinaspa chaymanta kay pacha.
He was great, she said.	Payqa hatunmi karqa, nispas nin.
But it seemed that way before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chayna rikchakurqa.
He has many things for you today.	Kunan punchawmi achka imakunatapas qampaq kachkan.
John was furious.	Juanqa phiñasqa kasqa.
Or, no, that’s not right.	Utaq, mana, chayqa manam allinchu.
Why would he do that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwanman.
This is a human being.	Kayqa runam.
I don’t want to see anything.	Manam imatapas qawayta munanichu.
I am very happy with that.	Chaywanmi ancha kusisqa kachkani.
So no one realized that he could figure everything out.	Chaymi mana pipas repararqanchu tukuy imatapas yuyaymanayta atisqanmanta.
I'm sorry, he says.	Pampachaykuway, nispas nin.
But everyone wants to be rich.	Ichaqa llapa runan qhapaq kayta munanku.
He wanted to know how you were doing.	Payqa imayna kasqaykita yachayta munarqa.
You don’t want to.	Manam munankichu.
If there is a	Chaypi kaptinqa .
He was very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
If all else fails, it went wrong.	Tukuy ima mana allinchu kanman chayqa, mana allintachu rirqa.
How did he do that?	¿Imaynatan chayta ruwarqan?
He seemed surprised.	Payqa admirasqa hinam karqa.
It’s a really interesting time.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq pacha.
You can't come.	Manan hamuyta atiwaqchu.
He was absent yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi mana chaypichu karqa.
And that’s what he did.	Hinaspa chayta ruwarqa.
That’s everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas.
That’s not me.	Chayqa manam ñuqachu.
Maybe someday this weekend.	Ichapas huk punchaw kay semana tukukuypi.
I wanted to believe that.	Chaynatam creeyta munarqani.
I said sure enough.	Ñuqaqa segurom nirqani.
I know, sadly.	Yachanim, llakisqa.
Many, many things.	Achka, achka imakuna.
I really wanted to say thank you.	Anchatam gracias niyta munarqani.
He was there last night.	Payqa qayna tutam chaypi karqa.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
Like anywhere else.	Maypipas hina.
And really happy.	Hinaspa chiqap kusisqa.
I want to be like him.	Pay hina kaytam munani.
Instead, he will be seriously injured.	Aswanpas sinchitan k’irisqa kanqa.
And that’s going to be huge.	Hinaspa chayqa hatunmi kanqa.
Or, sometimes, worse.	Utaq, wakin kuti, aswan mana allin.
So he can be with her.	Chaymi payqa paywan kanman.
That was too early.	Chayqa llumpay ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqa.
Do it every morning and afternoon.	Sapa paqarin, tarde ima ruway.
We agree that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam acuerdopi kayku.
He can't remember what he used to be like.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atinchu ñawpaqpi imayna kasqanmanta.
This is what we did.	Kayta ruwarqayku.
Why not?	Imanasqa mana?
Just about everyone, anyway.	Yaqa llapa runa, imayna kaptinpas.
He is a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runam.
He couldn't see her.	Payqa manam qawayta atirqachu.
He said he didn't know why.	Paymi nirqa imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta mana yachasqanmanta.
I knew where he was going.	Yacharqanim mayman risqanmanta.
We need to act quickly.	Chayllam imatapas ruwananchik.
They are usually very popular.	Yaqa llapanpim ancha riqsisqa kanku.
Now I don't know what to do.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
I’ve been here before.	Ñawpaqta kaypi karqani.
I probably never will.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas ruwasaqchu.
This is a new feature.	Kayqa huk musuq ruwaymi.
I had no idea what was going on.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want that to be me.	Manam munanichu chay ñuqa kananta.
Like last week.	Qayna semana hina.
I'd rather it not happen to him.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana paywan pasananta.
You’re not like me.	Manam ñuqa hinachu kanki.
But things are not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas.
There it was.	Chaypim karqa.
Like two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaq hina.
This is a very sad situation.	Kayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
It’s actually a wonderful thing.	Chiqaptaqa huk sumaq ruwaymi.
So it was everything.	Chaymi tukuy imapas karqa.
I can wait!.	¡Suyayta atiyman!.
That probably happened.	Chayqa yaqapaschá pasarqa.
If he couldn’t.	Sichus pay mana atirqanchu chayqa.
You have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki.
It’s almost everyone.	Yaqa llapa runam.
He was a man of the past.	Payqa huk runam karqa.
And now he was here.	Hinaspa kunanqa kaypi kasqa.
So they agree.	Chaymi paykunaqa acuerdopi kanku.
It wasn’t for anything.	Manam imapaqpas karqachu.
Very nice of him.	Ancha sumaqmi paymanta.
There was no night.	Manam tutaqa karqachu.
Everything looked great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Again, nothing major.	Yapamanta, mana imapas hatun.
Not here, anyway.	Mana kaypiqa, imayna kaptinpas.
Next time, maybe.	Qatiqnin kutipi, ichapas.
To say what he meant.	Ima nisqanta rimananpaq.
Agree with that.	Chaywan acuerdopi kay.
More like three.	Aswan kimsa hina.
And he’s with me.	Hinaspa payqa ñuqawan.
Not too bad, really.	Mana ancha mana allinchu, chiqap.
It’s not worth it.	Manam valenchu.
It is not good now.	Kunanqa manam allinchu kachkan.
He was tired and sad.	Payqa sayk’usqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
Good day.	Allin punchaw.
That doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu.
How can you not.	Imaynatataq mana.
If not, say so.	Mana chayqa, chayta niy.
But you’re the one who does it.	Ichaqa qanmi chayta ruwanki.
It’s not this!.	¡Manan kaychu!.
I think this might be the problem.	Yuyaykuni kaymi kanman chay sasachakuy.
Now that’s the problem.	Kunanqa chay sasachakuy.
He’s done this before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayta ruwarqan.
Maybe I’ll go crazy.	Ichapas loco kasaq.
I wanted to hear a word.	Huk simita uyariyta munarqani.
What is the characteristic?.	¿Imaynataq kanman?.
There must be one.	Hukninmi kanan.
So don’t be too sure about that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa ama llumpayta seguro kaychu.
Everyone wants to help him.	Lliwmi payta yanapayta munanku.
I don’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwani.
He could see nothing of this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.
He knows how to drive.	Payqa yachanmi carrota manejayta.
Maybe he was a real person.	Ichapas payqa chiqap runa karqa.
I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munani.
So it’s very sad.	Chaymi ancha llakisqa.
He went away.	Rirqa.
It’s a very good thing.	Ancha allin kaqmi.
Either way, it will be hidden.	Imayna kaptinpas, pakasqa kanqa.
You certainly exceeded his expectations.	Cheqaqtapunin suyakusqanmanta aswan allinta ruwarqanki.
Not such a big deal.	Mana chayna hatun ruwaychu.
That’s one of them.	Chayqa hukninmi.
It’s all over the top.	Tukuy hawapi hawapi.
Many people like humans.	Runa hina achka runakuna.
If so, the problem remains.	Chayna kaptinqa hinallam mana allinqa kachkan.
The man knew they were ready.	Chay runaqa allintan yacharqan listo kasqankuta.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
This year’s bigger.	Kay wata aswan hatun.
There I am here and there.	Chaypin kaypi chaypi kashani.
I could not have learned more.	Manam aswan yachayta atiymanchu karqa.
I know this is true.	Yachanim kayqa chiqap kasqanta.
But this was one of them.	Ichaqa kayqa hukninmi karqa.
He couldn't wait to see her.	Payqa manan suyayta atirqanchu payta rikuyta.
That is an important step.	Chayqa huk importante ruwaymi.
I wasn’t in a position to do anything else.	Manam huk ruwaykunata ruwanaypaq hinachu karqani.
I really want to go swimming.	Anchatan munani nadaq riyta.
That is not possible.	Chaytaqa manam atichwanchu.
He just wished he hadn't.	Chaylla mana chayta ruwananta munarqa.
You’re more of a player.	Qamqa aswan pukllaqmi kanki.
But in the winter it was miserable.	Ichaqa chiri tiempopiqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Ten days passed.	Chunka punchawmi pasarqa.
I knew he did these two or three things.	Yacharqanim kay iskay kimsa ruwaykunata ruwasqanmanta.
I’m here to stay.	Ñuqaqa kaypi kachkani.
It will be available in a short time.	Pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
They were all very tired.	Llapallankum ancha sayk’usqa karqaku.
Everyone, however, wants to be better.	Lliwmi ichaqa aswan allin kayta munanku.
He didn’t talk much.	Payqa manan anchatachu rimaq.
It’s not just that.	Manam chayllachu.
What is.	Imataq.
After all, it wasn't that bad.	Tukuy imamanta, mana chayna mana allinchu karqa.
I better make it easy for me.	Aswan allinmi ñuqapaq facil kananpaq.
He wanted to but couldn't do it.	Payqa munarqa ichaqa manam ruwayta atirqachu.
Yes, that is better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi.
If they are older, that is.	Sichus kuraq kanku chayqa, chaymi.
But now there is a problem.	Ichaqa kunanmi huk sasachakuy kachkan.
Much younger than you.	Achka sullk'a qammanta.
Maybe that’s the only good thing.	Ichapas chaylla allin kaq.
I can't talk about it tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu.
I can't quite agree with that.	Chaywanqa manam allintachu acuerdopi kayta atiyman.
He can swim very fast.	Payqa ancha utqayllam nadayta atin.
I’m still there.	Ñuqaqa chaypi hinallam kachkani.
About a week later.	Yaqa huk semana qhepamanmi.
Would you like to go for a walk?	¿Munawaqchu puriq riyta?
I'll do this.	Kayta ruwasaq.
Say it after me.	Ñoqa qhepaman niy.
Obviously they were wrong.	Sut’inmi kashan pantasqa kasqankuta.
Unlike other people.	Mana wakin runakuna hinachu.
I never heard from him again until now.	Kunankamaqa manañam haykapipas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
Every week.	Sapa semana.
A little while passed.	Huk chikan pacha pasarqa.
He said no, he couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu nispa.
And he eats her.	Hinaspa payta mikun.
He does it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chayta ruwan.
He's still really angry.	Payqa kunankamapas chiqaptam phiñasqa kachkan.
Anyway, it's.	Imayna kaptinpas.
The result should be quite nice.	Chay ruwasqanqa allin sumaqmi kanan.
Not to mention myself.	Mana ñuqamanta rimanaypaq.
He went out of the way.	Payqa lluqsirqa.
But no one knows.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu.
But he couldn’t stop her.	Ichaqa manan hark’ayta atirqanchu.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Ichapas huk punchaw, ichaqa manaraqmi.
So, that's all there is to it, really.	Chaymi, chaylla chaypi kachkan, chiqaptapuni.
You know you want to.	Yachankim munasqaykita.
Forgive me, please.	Pampachaykuway, ama hina kaspa.
I will never be ready.	Manam haykapipas listochu kasaq.
Not sure what's wrong.	Mana segurochu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I’m not going to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
But this is not true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu kayqa.
That was definitely the worst part.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin aswan mana allinqa karqan.
That’s fucking huge.	Chayqa millay hatunmi.
He was a very handsome man.	Payqa ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa.
They were all hungry and cold.	Llapallankum yarqasqa hinaspa chiri karqaku.
I won’t be here.	Manam kaypichu kasaq.
I wanted to live in that house.	Chay wasipi tiyayta munarqani.
But that doesn’t make sense.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
Here is what happened.	Kaypim kachkan imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I didn’t quite know what to say.	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima niyta.
Not sure what it is.	Mana segurochu imakuna kasqanmanta.
Maybe he’s a.	Ichapas payqa huk.
Now everyone knows.	Kunanqa llapa runam yachanku.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Manam pitapas chaynataqa riqsinichu.
It was yesterday, actually.	Qayna punchawmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
He was "very" disappointed.	Payqa "ancha" hukmanyasqa karqan.
It meant something, she was sure of it.	Imapas niyta munarqa, chaymantam payqa seguro karqa.
He knows everything about it.	Payqa tukuy imatam chaymanta yachan.
He was probably not good enough.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
And he’s him.	Hinaspa pay payta.
I'm really looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.
I had never been there before.	Manam haykapipas chaymanqa rirqanichu.
I don't know what to make of this.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
But what if it was me.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman ñuqa kaspayqa.
He wasn't here before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam kaypichu karqa.
He has been there for three years now.	Kunanqa kimsa watañam kachkan.
He was too lonely.	Payqa llumpay sapallanmi karqa.
Tonight would be a good one.	Kunan tutaqa allinmi kanman.
All right, him.	Allinmi, paytaqa.
It was every day.	Sapa punchawmi karqa.
He probably does that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwan.
A few things to keep him calm.	Huk iskay kimsa ruwaykunata mana llakisqa kananpaq.
I can't believe everything is going well for you.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu tukuy imapas qampaq allin kasqanmanta.
Again, the same thing.	Yapamanta, kikin kaq.
You can't make it without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam chayayta atiwaqchu.
So we are more conscious of that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa aswan yuyayniyuq kanchik.
I mean, it's night and day.	Niyta munani, tuta p'unchawmi.
To find out what happened and where he was.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta, maypi kasqanmanta yachananpaq.
And that's what it's all about.	Hinaspa chaymantam tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
I don't know why really.	Mana yachanichu imarayku chiqaptapuni.
There were about twenty of them.	Chay runakunaqa yaqa iskay chunka hinam karqaku.
I’ve done that a few times.	Chaytaqa iskay kinsa kutitan ruwarqani.
He is here tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam kaypi kachkan.
It doesn’t say that.	Manan chaytachu nin.
Tomorrow morning, baby.	Paqarin paqarin, wawa.
If that makes sense to you, that’s fine.	Sichus chayta ruway qanpaq allin chayqa, chayqa allinmi.
Nothing wrong, anyway.	Mana imapas mana allinchu, imayna kaptinpas.
He was rather frightened.	Payqa aswan mancharisqa kasharqan.
I think this is true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Everyone means well, but it’s hard.	Tukuy runa allinta niyta munan, ichaqa sasa.
Learn to ride a bicycle	Bicicletapi puriyta yachay
He was pretty stupid, actually.	Payqa allin sonso karqa, chiqaptaqa.
Needless to say, he was terrified.	Manañam niyta munanichu mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
They are good with that.	Chaywanmi allin kanku.
I have done it many times.	Achka kutitam ruwarqani.
This is a very easy thing to do.	Kayqa ancha facil ruwaymi.
He went through it.	Payqa chayman pasarqa.
Of course, it wasn’t.	Arí, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Now I knew better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam yacharqani.
The process was a first.	Chay ruwayqa huk ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
Who knows where the day before.	Pitaq yachan maypi ñawpaq p’unchaw kasqanmanta.
I would be depressed later.	Qhepamanmi llakisqa kayman.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa munarqanchu.
Something else caught.	Huk imapas hapisqa.
I know he can.	Yachanim atisqanmanta.
It was, in fact.	Chayqa karqan, cheqaqtapuni.
It went right away.	Chayllam rirqa.
I was sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom karqani.
Very nice indeed.	Ancha sumaq chiqap.
He will do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwanqa.
I couldn’t do that at all!	¡Manan chaytaqa ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu!
But he couldn’t wait.	Ichaqa manan suyayta atirqanchu.
Really, really good.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin.
He doesn’t want to leave.	Payqa manan munanchu ripuyta.
Why is he the one? 	¿Imaraykutaq pay?
Sure, that’s really nice.	Seguro, chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
No, it was better.	Manan, aswan allinmi karqan.
He was a strong speaker.	Payqa sinchitan rimaq karqan.
I do that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwani.
No, he doesn’t have to.	Manan, manan chaytachu ruwanan.
Two, maybe three years at most.	Iskay, ichapas kimsa wata aswan achka.
He wants to make a play.	Payqa pukllayta ruwayta munan.
He was a man like me.	Payqa ñuqa hina runam karqa.
I didn’t see it.	Manam rikurqanichu.
This was the biggest one.	Kayqa aswan hatunmi karqa.
I never had to do it.	Manam haykapipas ruwanay karqachu.
But this was really, really great.	Ichaqa kayqa chiqap, chiqap hatunmi karqa.
Most of the third season.	Yaqa llapan kimsa kaq pacha.
All right, he repeated.	Allinmi, nispas yapamanta nisqa.
I saw him for the first time.	Ñawpaq kutitan payta rikurqani.
He knows it’s good.	Yachanmi allin kasqanmanta.
That seems to mean something.	Chayqa imapas niyta munanman hina.
Do this several times a day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchaw achka kutita ruway.
Okay, you were right.	Allinmi, allintam nirqanki.
Who knows what happened.	Pi yachan ima pasasqanmanta.
We can't go anywhere today.	Kunan punchawqa manam maymanpas riyta atichwanchu.
This is the hardest part.	Kaymi aswan sasa kaq.
I wasn’t sure that was the case.	Manam segurochu karqani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe for you, he is.	Ichapas qampaq, payqa kanman.
He wants to talk to you.	Payqa qanwan rimayta munan.
They want to do it.	Paykunaqa ruwayta munanku.
Maybe you want to do something else.	Ichapas hukta ruwayta munanki.
He's right there.	Payqa allintam chaypi kachkan.
He couldn’t do it.	Mana atirqachu.
Otherwise it will be.	Mana chayqa kanqa.
He doesn’t like it, he says.	Payqa manan gustanchu, nispan nin.
That’s why he’s here.	Chayraykum payqa kaypi kachkan.
He couldn't sleep last night.	Qayna tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqachu.
I thought maybe.	Ichapas nispaymi piensarqani.
I hear it now.	Kunanmi uyarini.
But it was very much like that.	Ichaqa anchatan chhayna karqan.
He wanted to leave, now.	Payqa ripuyta munarqa, kunan.
There is a secret.	Huk pakasqa kachkan.
He is a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam.
I couldn’t believe it would happen.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna pasananta.
This would be very stupid.	Kayqa ancha sonso kaymi kanman.
Do that for yourself.	Chaytaqa qampaq ruway.
I really am.	Chiqaptam kani.
I hope this is better.	Suyachkani kayqa aswan allin kananpaq.
Nothing can go wrong now.	Kunanqa manan imapas mana allinchu kanman.
He would have to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
It was always his name.	Sapa kutim sutin karqa.
I know what you can do.	Yachanim ima ruway atisqaykita.
But that’s the name.	Ichaqa chay sutinmi.
He says he knows.	Payqa yachanim nin.
It turned out better.	Aswan allintam lluqsirqa.
It really, really does.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, ruwan.
Tell me the whole story.	Tukuy willakuyta willaway.
I love to eat two ways.	Iskay ñanta mikhuyta anchata munani.
Surely, there has to be something.	Chiqamanta, imapas kanan tiyan.
And that's what it was supposed to be.	Hinaspa chaymi chayna kanan karqa.
I’ve never seen it before.	Mana hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu.
That now is huge.	Chay kunanqa hatunmi.
That was him now.	Chayqa paymi kunan kasqa.
I don’t want him to.	Manam munanichu chayta ruwaptinqa.
But let’s wait and see.	Ichaqa suyasun.
Not really very good, but really very bad.	Mana chiqap ancha allinchu, ichaqa chiqap ancha mana allinmi.
It’s a day.	Huk punchawmi.
I want to see him.	Payta rikuyta munani.
He never wants to see that again.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta hukmanta rikuyta munanchu.
He certainly is.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
I want to go there, he says.	Chayman riyta munani, nispas nin.
I'll do that.	Chayta ruwasaq.
I really think this is going to be huge.	Chiqaptam piensani kayqa hatun kanqa.
The man is a teacher.	Chay runaqa yachachiqmi.
There is no one like him.	Pay hinaqa manam kanchu.
Do what you want to do.	Munasqaykita ruway.
He really is a great guy.	Payqa chiqaptam hatun runa.
Everything seems very serious.	Tukuy imapas ancha serio hinam.
But this would be a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi kanman.
I have done very well so far.	Kunankamaqa ancha allintam ruwarqani.
But probably no one will.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana pipas ruwanqachu.
But you go first.	Ichaqa qanmi ñawpaqta rinki.
No, it's	Manan, chayqa .
I know that is not an easy task.	Yachanim chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
The injured man is in critical condition.	Chay k’irisqa runaqa sinchitan kashan.
It sounds very good.	Ancha allinmi uyarikun.
He is an older man.	Aswan kuraq runam.
He didn’t do that anymore.	Payqa manañan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I couldn't believe it, but he was right.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu, ichaqa allintam nirqa.
This does not mean nothing.	Kayqa manam mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
I am, of course, worried about it.	Ñuqaqa, chiqamanta, chaymanta llakikuni.
Go quickly.	Usqhaylla riy.
But today he is a good man.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa payqa allin runan.
I hope that is not the case for you.	Suyachkani mana chayna kananta qampaq.
It’s good for him.	Paypaq allin.
And then he started singing.	Hinaspa chaymanta takiyta qallaykurqa.
He was probably older than me.	Payqa yaqapaschá ñoqamanta kuraq karqan.
You can’t understand it, now.	Mana entiendeyta atiwaqchu, kunanqa.
But I hope he doesn't.	Ichaqa mana chayta ruwananta suyachkani.
Maybe more than that.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan achka.
It was a beautiful evening.	Sumaq ch’isi karqan.
I can’t remember anything.	Manam imatapas yuyariyta atinichu.
I mean, seriously.	Niyta munani, serio.
All right, you said.	Allinmi, nirqanki.
To be safe.	Seguro kananpaq.
Okay, maybe not, but if only there was.	Allinmi, ichapas mana, ichaqa sichus kanman karqan chayqa.
I could not have done without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam ruwaymanchu karqa.
I want to see him, that’s all.	Payta rikuyta munani, chaylla.
I didn't think so.	Manam chaynataqa piensarqanichu.
You can't do it.	Atiwaqchu.
'I'm doing it.	'Ñuqa' ruwachkani.
Everyone was there.	Llapallankum chaypi karqaku.
She really wanted to believe him.	Payqa anchatan munarqan payta creeyta.
Okay, maybe he did.	Allinmi, ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
You can't get a job again.	Manam llamkayta hukmanta tariyta atiwaqchu.
She never got to go to summer school.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas verano escuelaman riyta atirqanchu.
This was not supposed to be a big deal.	Kayqa manam hatun ruwaychu kanan karqa.
First, ask the why question.	Ñawpaqtaqa imarayku tapuyta ruway.
I really wasn’t sure.	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqani.
That actually makes a lot of sense.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa achka yuyayniyuqmi.
I really want to know.	Chiqaptam yachayta munani.
Maybe he's injured.	Ichapas payqa k'irisqa kachkan.
There was no one here.	Manam pipas kaypi karqachu.
That’s a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi.
Everything that could ever be.	Tukuy ima hayk’aqpas kanman karqan.
And that's what this is about.	Hinaspa chaymantam kayqa rimachkan.
I’m not that person.	Manam chay runachu kani.
Very good.	Achka allin.
People were tired.	Runakunaqa sayk’usqañan karqanku.
He did it right.	Payqa allintam chayta ruwarqa.
Some people don’t.	Wakin runakunaqa manam chaynatachu.
You are very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kachkanki.
Here, everything is fresh.	Kaypiqa, tukuy imapas chayllaraqmi.
Do you want to come?.	¿Hamuyta munankichu?.
Really, anything though.	Chiqaptaqa, imapas ichaqa.
There is one thing.	Huk kaqmi.
Even so, we made the game anyway.	Chayna kaptinpas, imayna kaptinpas pukllayta ruwarqayku.
The unknown is the greatest.	Mana riqsisqa kaqmi aswan hatun kaq.
I won’t be here in the morning.	Manam tutamanta kaypichu kasaq.
I’m not happy about that.	Chaypaqqa manan kusisqachu kani.
But that didn’t happen often.	Ichaqa manan askha kutichu chayqa karqan.
But it wasn’t what he wanted.	Ichaqa manan munasqanman hinachu karqan.
And how he wants to live there.	Hinaspa imaynatas chaypi tiyayta munan chayta.
Tell him what to do.	Willay ima ruwananta.
Every day here is like the day before.	Kaypiqa sapa punchawmi ñawpaq punchaw hina.
I was never happy.	Manam haykapipas kusisqachu karqani.
That’s a lot of people.	Chayqa achka runakunam.
We are individuals.	Sapa runam kanchik.
I wanted to tell you.	Willayta munarqani.
Never really made time.	Mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqtapuni tiempota ruwarqanchu.
Unfortunately, this fails.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
A cigarette and a cigarette.	Huk cigarrota huk cigarrota.
We are usually good communicators.	Yaqa llapanpim allin rimaq runakuna kanchik.
We didn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
That was a good thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi karqa.
I felt very secure.	Ancha segurom tarikurqani.
Where do you live?	Maypitaq yachanki?
I’m thinking about this.	Kaypi yuyaykuni.
It's not that difficult really.	Manam chayna sasachu chiqaptaqa.
He was very curious.	Payqa anchatam yachayta munarqa.
Yes, that means today.	Arí, chaymi kunan punchaw niyta munan.
But it’s better.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi.
That’s the second best thing.	Chayqa iskay kaq aswan allin kaqmi.
Do it quickly and then.	Utqaylla chaymanta ruway.
He didn't look like he was hurt.	Manam k'irisqa hinachu rikchakurqa.
Were they real?.	¿Cheqaqchu karqanku?.
I mean, you know.	Niyta munani, yachanki.
That is.	Kaymi.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta yachayta munarqa.
Everything is still, now.	Tukuy imapas hinallam kachkan, kunanqa.
It's not worth it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam valenchu.
You’ll learn quickly.	Utqaylla yachanki.
That’s going to be a good day.	Chayqa allin p’unchaymi kanqa.
I don’t want to understand.	Manam entiendeyta munanichu.
Good morning, everyone.	Allin p'unchaw, llapa runa.
This coffee is very strong.	Kay kukata ancha sinchi.
The great thing is.	Hatun kaq.
They love it so much.	Chaytaqa anchatam munanku.
There is no room for that here.	Chaypaqqa manan kaypiqa kanchu.
So yeah, that’s a good thing.	Chaymi arí, chayqa allinmi.
It looks beautiful.	Sumaqmi rikchakun.
Very, very good.	Ancha, ancha allin.
Bad, bad, wrong.	Mana allin, mana allin, pantasqa.
He doesn’t speak very often.	Payqa manan ancha sapa kutichu riman.
Therefore, he will not do it.	Chayraykum mana ruwanqachu.
Here it is, baby.	Kaypi kachkan, wawa.
How do they both know.	Imaynatam iskayninku yachanku.
Someone better hurry things up.	Pipas aswan allinmi imatapas usqhaylla ruway.
The time you want.	Munasqayki pacha.
Please tell me this is not it.	Ama hina kaspa willaway mana kaychu kasqanmanta.
I never knew that until recently.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yacharqanichu, chayllaraqmi.
He stayed with me.	Ñoqawanmi qhepakurqan.
What’s the possibility	Imataq kanman
All day and most of the night.	Tukuy punchaw hinaspa yaqa llapan tuta.
This is quick.	Kayqa utqayllam.
Can anyone do that please.	¿Pipas chayta ruwayta atinmanchu ama hina kaspa.
I want him here.	Paytaqa kaypim munani.
He said, 'It's.	Payqa nisqa.
That doesn’t sound right.	Chayqa manan allinchu uyarikun.
I don’t want him to come.	Manam munanichu hamunanta.
I don't remember how many years ago.	Manam yuyarinichu hayka wata ñawpaqtaqa.
You know, something very interesting.	Yachanki, imapas ancha sumaq.
I can still do it.	Hinallam atiyman.
All those things are there.	Tukuy chay imakuna chaypi kachkan.
But that was last year.	Ichaqa chayqa karqan qayna wata.
Here, it wasn’t.	Kaypiqa, manam karqachu.
But eventually he talked to someone.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi piwanpas rimarqan.
He knows when that happens.	Payqa yachanmi haykapi chayna kasqanmanta.
I didn't see him there that night.	Chay tutaqa manam chaypiqa rikurqanichu.
He's like crazy.	Payqa loco hinam kachkan.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!.	Gracias, gracias, gracias!.
He soon failed.	Pisi tiempollamantan mana atirqanchu.
But that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan chayqa allinchu.
I can’t be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atiymanchu.
So it's a happy day.	Chaymi kusisqa punchaw.
But they are as good as not there now.	Ichaqa kunan mana chaypi hina allinmi kanku.
Not me though.	Mana ñuqachu ichaqa.
I want to be here.	Kaypi kaytam munani.
But it’s not too difficult.	Ichaqa manan ancha sasachu.
To his house.	Wasinman.
That’s what we had to do.	Chaytan ruwanayku karqan.
We are in town for the next two days.	Qatiqnin iskay punchawmi llaqtapi kachkaniku.
It was colder last night.	Qayna tutam aswan chiri karqa.
I don't know how long.	Manam yachanichu hayka unayta.
I wonder where he lives.	Maypi tiyasqanmanta tapukuni.
I’ve never heard of it.	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu.
People are hurt.	Runakunaqa k’irisqa kanku.
Do it now!	¡Kunan ruway!
I want to hear what he has to say about it.	Chaymanta ima nisqanmanta uyariyta munani.
He vehemently failed to do so.	Chaytaqa sinchitan mana ruwarqanchu.
I doubt that’s all.	Iskayrayani chaylla kasqanmanta.
This has never happened before.	Manam haykapipas kayqa karqachu.
What a year.	Ima wata.
And do it again.	Hinaspa yapamanta ruway.
I can agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayta atiyman.
He can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atinchu.
The process makes it less intense.	Chay ruwayqa manaña anchatachu sinchita ruwan.
He eats almost anything.	Yaqa imatapas mikun.
The truth was pretty simple.	Chiqap kaqmi ancha facil karqa.
This is a very big deal.	Kayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi.
Everything is the same as before.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaq hinam kachkan.
I said this last time.	Kayta qhipa kutita nirqani.
Tomorrow will be bad weather.	Paqarinmi mana allin pacha kanqa.
We are very much.	Anchatam kanchik.
And then there’s time.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanmi pacha.
Instead of the current situation.	Kunan kasqanmantaqa.
How sad it is.	Imayna llakisqa.
Wherever it is.	Maypipas kasqanmantaqa.
And we did just that.	Hinaspa chaynatam ruwarqayku.
If nothing else, that is.	Mana imapas huk kaptinqa, chaymi.
But that would be a mistake.	Ichaqa chay nisqanqa mana allinchu kanman.
I can’t leave it at that.	Manam chaynataqa saqiyta atiymanchu.
He wanted it to be real.	Payqa munarqa chiqap kananta.
He refused to answer.	Payqa manan kutichiyta munarqanchu.
I know you've been there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqaykita.
Like yours, here.	Qampa hina, kaypi.
What he said was very simple.	Imapas nisqanqa ancha sasam karqa.
That seemed so crazy.	Chayqa ancha loco hinam karqa.
But he couldn’t, not yet.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu, manaraqmi.
Otherwise it doesn’t matter.	Mana chayqa manan imananpaschu.
He wants the wrong thing.	Payqa mana allintam munan.
I couldn’t speak.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu.
It didn't work out anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas mana allintachu ruwarqa.
I know.	Yachanim.
I want to know everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata yachayta munani.
Everything goes so fast.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam rin.
He knows nothing, apparently.	Payqa manan imatapas yachanchu, yaqapaschá.
That was a difficult task.	Chayqa sasa ruwaymi karqa.
The teenager is at home.	Chay wayna sipasmi wasinpi kachkan.
It was really bad.	Chiqamanta mana allinchu karqa.
There is no one.	Manan pipas kanchu.
I hope it happens soon.	Suyachkani chaylla pasananta.
It could have been better.	Aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
Now he can't find any food here.	Kunanqa manam kaypi ima mikhunata tariyta atinchu.
I couldn’t figure out where the problem was.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu maypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Looks really good.	Chiqap allin rikchakun.
Maybe, a little bit.	Ichapas, huk chikan.
He didn’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwarqanchu.
I didn’t want to sleep.	Manam puñuyta munarqanichu.
Can you play this song?	¿Atiwaqchu kay takiyta tocayta?
I don’t ask too many questions.	Manam anchatachu tapukuni.
They were almost outcasts.	Paykunaqa yaqa qarqusqa runakunam karqaku.
Why not?' 	Imanasqa mana?'
What a happy man he is.	Ima kusisqa runam payqa.
That sounds pretty bad.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi uyarikun.
He has always been like that.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
He couldn't do anything about it.	Payqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
That would have been a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi kanman karqan.
More more more more.	Aswan aswan aswan aswan.
They weren’t like me.	Paykunaqa manan ñoqa hinachu karqanku.
You were so good!	¡Ancha allinmi karqanki!
That’s obviously not going to happen.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana kanqachu.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikuyta munarqanichu.
I want to know what’s going on.	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I would love to know why.	Anchatan munani imarayku chayta yachayta.
He’ll do it again.	Yapamanta ruwanqa.
Don’t do that, he said firmly.	Ama chayta ruwaychu, nispas sinchita nisqa.
He always seems to be injured.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi k’irisqa hina kashan.
Perhaps he should have.	Ichapas chayta ruwanan karqa.
He was glad he didn't know how to drive.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa carrota manejayta mana yachasqanmanta.
In the last week.	Kay qhipa semanapi.
He loves to play, he loves to play.	Payqa pukllayta anchata munan, pukllayta anchata munan.
This isn’t.	Kayta mana.
It's like building a house.	Chayqa huk wasi ruway hinam.
She was a good time girl.	Payqa allin tiempo sipasmi karqan.
This was a pretty big deal.	Kayqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
I was tired of it.	Chaywanmi sayk’usqa karqani.
I was very happy with that.	Chaywanmi sinchi kusisqa karqani.
Of course, he is.	Chiqamanta, payqa kachkan.
But it looks good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakun.
He thought it was too cold.	Payqa sinchi chiri kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
Now hardly anyone goes there.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá pipas chayman rin.
But do it right.	Ichaqa allinta ruway.
And ten years.	Hinaspa chunka wata.
I never knew it was that big.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna hatun kasqanmanta.
Is it a good practice?.	¿Allin ruwaychu?.
In the morning.	Kusikuni.
That’s why you can’t say anything.	Chayraykum mana ima niyta atiwaqchu.
I’m afraid this is it.	Manchakuni kay kasqanmanta.
He can't walk very well.	Payqa manam ancha allintachu puriyta atin.
Almost no one can.	Yaqa mana pipas atinmanchu.
The bigger the better.	Aswan hatun kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
That makes me feel really good.	Chayqa ancha allintam sientekuni.
So, it’s okay.	Chaymi, allinmi.
Very very much so.	Ancha ancha chayna.
I don’t know why, it just is.	Mana yachanichu imarayku, chaylla kachkan.
That’s not going to happen here.	Chayqa manan kaypiqa kanqachu.
I didn’t know that was the case.	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really want to help.	Anchatan munani yanapayta.
Okay, so it looks great.	Allinmi, chaymi ancha allinta rikchakun.
Maybe he’s right.	Ichapas payqa allinta rimachkan.
Never never never again.	Mana hayk’aqpas mana hayk’aqpas.
He could have done a lot of things today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi achka ruwaykunata ruwanman karqa.
He realized that he could speak the language better.	Repararqanmi chay simipi aswan allinta rimayta atisqanmanta.
He certainly knew that wasn’t true.	Cheqaqtapunin yacharqan chay mana cheqaq kasqanmanta.
Now, he is worried.	Kunanqa, llakisqa kachkan.
There was one there, yes.	Chaypi huk kasqa, arí.
These are great people.	Kaykunaqa hatun runakunam.
Not to do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwanapaq.
That what’s more important.	Chay imachus aswan importante.
That’s why he does this.	Chayraykum kayta ruwan.
So I was the one.	Chaymi ñoqaqa karqani.
He’s obviously not human.	Payqa sut’inmi mana runachu.
Repeat the second time.	Iskay kaq kutita yapamanta ruway.
But I couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
These were bad, bad people.	Kaykunaqa mana allin, mana allin runakunam karqaku.
I want to know what happened there.	Chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munani.
Now, that’s it.	Kunanqa, chayta.
He's always so good.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna allin.
He means it.	Payqa niyta munan.
He had to do it right.	Payqa allintan chayta ruwanan karqan.
They were very happy.	Paykunaqa ancha kusisqam karqaku.
He looked better tonight.	Payqa kunan tutan aswan allinta qhawarisqa.
I have no idea what happened.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I am sure it will be here very soon.	Seguro kani ancha utqaylla kaypi kananmanta.
That is what he had to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwanan karqan.
This seems pretty big.	Kayqa ancha hatunmi rikchakun.
You're really not bad at this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kaypiqa mana allinchu kanki.
It’s never easy.	Manam haykapipas facilchu.
Now, it’s not that simple.	Kunanqa, manan chay hina facilchu.
So that’s what this is.	Chaymi chaymi kayqa.
That was insane.	Chayqa loco hinam karqa.
That would be stupid.	Chayqa sonso kaymi kanman.
But the sooner the better.	Ichaqa aswan usqhayllan aswan allinqa.
No, he wasn’t.	Manan, payqa manan karqanchu.
He made coffee.	Payqa kukata ruwarqa.
He is just me.	Payqa ñuqallam kachkan.
We can't leave.	Manam ripuyta atichwanchu.
I love playing this game.	Kay pukllayta pukllayta anchata munani.
It’s going to be difficult.	Sasa kanqa.
He knew how to do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwayta.
In fact, there is a better truth.	Aswanpas kanmi aswan allin cheqaq kaq.
That was thirty years ago.	Chayqa karqa kimsa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
It was really, really hard.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sinchi sasa karqa.
I know it’s not me.	Yachanim mana ñuqachu kasqayta.
I would like to help you.	Munaymanmi yanapayta.
He never thought much of it, at least not seriously.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa anchatachu yuyaykurqan, aswanpas manan allintachu yuyaykurqan.
But you have to do it.	Ichaqa qanmi ruwanayki.
I'd rather he talk about what we're doing.	Aswan allinmi kanman chay ruwasqaykumanta rimananpaq.
Something isn’t very good.	Imapas mana ancha allinchu.
Great performance.	Hatun ruway.
Something just happened.	Wakin imapas chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
He looked as old as I did.	Payqa ñuqa hinam kuraq rikchakurqa.
I didn’t want to ask.	Manam tapuyta munarqanichu.
There was no point talking to him about this.	Manam imapaqpas karqachu kaymanta paywan rimayqa.
Isn’t it beautiful.	Manachu sumaq.
It gets bigger and bigger.	Aswan hatunmi aswan hatunmi.
I don’t remember why.	Manam yuyarinichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
He told me that the mansion was mine.	Paymi niwarqa chay hatun wasi ñuqapa kasqanmanta.
It was a very popular one.	Chayqa ancha riqsisqa kaqmi karqa.
He didn't look cold.	Payqa manam chiri hinachu rikchakurqa.
I don’t know if he ever realized that.	Mana yachanichu chayta hayk’aqllapas repararqanchu icha manachu chayta.
I really want him to be surprised.	Anchatam munani admirasqa kananta.
He did something wrong, not me.	Payqa mana allintam ruwarqa, manam ñuqachu.
He’s a very good player.	Payqa ancha allin pukllaqmi.
But really, there's nothing really wrong with that.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam imapas chiqap mana allinchu chaypiqa.
It should be a good day.	Allin punchawmi kanan.
Doing something is something.	Imatapas ruwayqa imapas.
What do you want to do?	¿Imatam ruwayta munanki?
I kept thinking about the problem.	Hinallam chay sasachakuypi piensarqani.
How do you do the same thing?.	¿Imaynatataq qampas chaynata ruwanki?.
So this is not a good thing.	Chaymi kayqa mana allinchu.
You may not even know it’s there.	Manapaschá yachankichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa.
It was like that.	Chayna hinam karqa.
It’s not nearly as cold as last night.	Manam qayna tuta hinachu yaqa chiri.
I was happy to be there.	Kusisqam karqani.
He looked like he could drive	Payqa carrota manejananpaq hinan kasqa
I just know it’s coming here.	Chaylla yachani kayman hamunanta.
He’s a very popular player.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa pukllaqmi.
Like twice as much.	Iskay kutita hina.
So, we are very excited.	Chaymi, ancha kusisqa kachkaniku.
Stay with us.	Ñoqaykuwan kay.
I don’t understand what he wants.	Manam entiendenichu ima munasqanmanta.
I didn’t know much about it but I knew it was nothing of the sort.	Manam anchatachu yacharqani chaymanta ichaqa yacharqanim mana imapas chayna kasqanmanta.
One more thing.	Huknin aswan.
Nothing can do nothing.	Manan imapas mana ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
Maybe he was the one.	Ichapas payqa chayna karqa.
That seemed too good to be true.	Chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa mana chiqap kananpaq.
I don’t want to do it here.	Manam kaypi ruwayta munanichu.
There was no reason.	Manam imaraykupas karqachu.
For example.	Kay hina.
How to do this?.	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwanapaq?.
But without doing anything.	Ichaqa mana imatapas ruwaspa.
I don’t do that.	Ñoqaqa manam chaytaqa ruwanchu.
But he had to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanan karqan.
Unfortunately, he wasn't there.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa manam chaypichu karqa.
I am something else entirely.	Ñuqaqa huk imapas llapanpim kani.
But he is not like other people.	Ichaqa manan huk runakuna hinachu.
Not like here.	Mana kaypi hinachu.
He would never have done that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanmanchu karqan.
You’re lucky.	Suerteyoqmi kanki.
He would have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
You keep doing it.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanki.
I never saw anyone.	Manam haykapipas pitapas rikurqanichu.
I almost can’t help it.	Yaqa mana yanapayta atinichu.
People.	Runakuna.
He said he was disappointed.	Payqa hukmanyasqa kasqanmantam nirqa.
Don’t forget to say thank you.	Ama qunqaychu gracias niyta.
So far this is what I have done.	Kunankamaqa kaytam ruwarqani.
I want to be this.	Ñuqa kaytam munani.
That, however, was not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Learn what it is like.	Imayna kasqanmanta yachay.
He can make coffee.	Payqa kukata ruwanman.
But he couldn't say that now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa chayta niyta atirqanchu.
But he always spoke.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi rimaq.
He knew a lot about her.	Payqa achkatam paymanta yacharqa.
He couldn't walk.	Payqa manam puriyta atirqachu.
Fast, and a lot.	Utqaylla, hinaspa achka.
Yes, that’s the first one.	Arí, chayqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
Thank you, man.	Gracias, runa.
He’s a good player.	Payqa allin pukllaqmi.
By doing this.	Kayta ruwaspa.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan pay ruwarqan.
Why not now?.	¿Imanasqataq kunan mana?.
This was a very special day.	Kayqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
I don’t know where it is.	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
This is for you first.	Kayqa qampaq ñawpaqta.
Tell me why you want it.	Willaway imanasqa munasqaykita.
Is it better or less.	Aswan allinchu aswan pisi.
He went with it.	Chaywanmi rirqa.
But never again.	Ichaqa manaña hayk’aqpas.
You are the problem here.	Qam kaypi sasachakuy kanki.
It took about half an hour.	Chayqa kuskan hora hinan karqan.
If nothing else .	Mana imapas huk kaptinqa .
He was almost one now.	Payqa kunanqa yaqa hukninmi kasqa.
Always do one thing at a time.	Sapa kutim hukta hukmanta ruway.
You were wrong.	Pantasqa karqanki.
I have to do this.	Kayta ruwanay tiyan.
He’s such a fun, happy person.	Payqa chhayna kusisqa, kusisqa runan.
Not good, maybe.	Mana allinchu, ichapas.
This is the most important thing.	Kaymi aswan allinqa.
He said he’d prefer that.	Chaytaqa aswan allinta munanman nispas nisqa.
But this is obvious.	Ichaqa kayqa sut’inmi.
But I really have no way to tell.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana imayna willanaypaq kanchu.
I don’t know how to help.	Manam yachanichu imaynata yanapayta.
I'm waiting.	Suyachkani.
And he thought it was all great.	Hinaspa payqa yuyaykurqan llapan hatun kananpaq.
This is the guy.	Kaymi chay runa.
I am confused as to why.	Imarayku kasqanmantam pantasqa kachkani.
That was a very good thing.	Chay hinaqa ancha allinmi karqan.
You were a great guy.	Hatunmi karqanki.
She’s a new girl.	Payqa musuq sipasmi.
I didn't think it was serious.	Manam piensarqanichu serio kananpaq.
I heard a lot about you.	Achkatam uyarirqani qammanta.
I am not so sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam chayna segurochu kani.
There was no time.	Tiempo karqanchu.
For you.	Qampaq.
How much.	Hayka.
Again, very clever.	Yapamanta, ancha yachaysapa.
There were no people anywhere.	Manam maypipas runakunaqa karqachu.
A very young one at that.	Huk ancha wayna chaypi.
So it seems.	Chaymi rikchakun.
They are the most awesome people, the best people.	Aswan manchay runakunam, aswan allin runakunam.
I thought maybe you could do something with it.	Yuyarqanim ichapas chaywan imatapas ruwawaq.
I was indeed exhausted earlier.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaqtaqa sayk’usqa karqani.
But it is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa allinmi chay ruwayqa.
But he knew he wouldn't.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
Many people are not happy.	Askha runakunaqa manan kusisqachu kashanku.
So fucking stupid.	Chaymi millay sonso.
Even though he’s home now, he’s sad.	Kunan wasipi kaptinpas, llakisqa.
Anyway, here it is.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim kachkan.
It’s amazing in every way.	Tukuy imapipas admirakuypaqmi.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Payqa manam chayna runachu karqa.
I don't care who it is.	Manam imananpaschu pi kasqanmantaqa.
But otherwise, it was no better.	Ichaqa mana chayna kaptinqa manam aswan allinchu karqa.
I want to study that.	Chayta estudiayta munani.
That went really well.	Chayqa ancha allintam rirqa.
He wasn't there.	Payqa manam chaypichu karqa.
This was very quick.	Kayqa ancha utqayllam karqa.
He was very happy about it.	Payqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan chaymanta.
It was another horrible week of school.	Huk manchay semanan karqan escuelapi.
Anything, at least.	Imapas, aswanpas.
The first morning.	Ñawpaq kaq paqarin.
This is what it sounds like.	Kaymi uyarikun.
Yes, maybe it was.	Arí, ichapas chayna karqa.
I am as busy as ever.	Ñawpaq hinam ocupasqa kachkani.
He was a great man.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
I don’t see why not.	Manam rikunichu imarayku mana.
That’s probably the most important thing.	Chayqa ichapas aswan importante kaq.
Every second day, or so.	Sapa iskay kaq punchaw, utaq chayna.
Time.	Hayka pacha.
He was eager to learn.	Payqa anchatam munarqa yachananpaq.
That’s the same thing.	Chay kikin.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Most people were unhappy.	Yaqa llapan runakunam mana kusisqachu karqaku.
He was very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi kasqa.
He allowed it to be that way.	Chayna kananpaqmi saqirqa.
You can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He sat like this many times.	Chaynatam achka kutita tiyaq.
He said he felt better.	Paymi nirqa aswan allin sientekusqanmanta.
In the carriage.	Chay carropi.
It’s easier for you.	Aswan facilmi qampaq.
Not so much anymore.	Mana anchatachu manaña.
He doesn’t know what he wants to do.	Manam yachanchu ima ruway munasqanmanta.
It’s not a good thing.	Manas allinchu.
They are very angry.	Ancha phiñasqa kachkanku.
But why is it wrong?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaraykutaq pantasqa?.
The result was spectacularly bad.	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi mana allin karqa.
It was today.	Kunanmi karqa.
This is really impressive.	Kayqa chiqap admirakuypaqmi.
The man was terrified.	Chay runaqa mancharisqa kasqa.
It would have been there for a while.	Huk rato chaypi kanman karqan.
I want to know more about that.	Chaymanta astawan yachayta munani.
More than once.	Aswan huk kuti.
Wherever you want to go, you will be there immediately.	Maymanpas riyta munaspaqa chayllam chaypi kanki.
Not doing it is stupid.	Mana ruwayqa sonso kaymi.
I probably still do.	Yaqapaschá kunankamapas chayta ruwani.
Maybe it meant something.	Ichapas imapas niyta munarqa.
And in the end, I ill wonder why.	Hinaspa tukukuypi, unqusqa tapukuni imarayku.
He knew what was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna hamunanta.
I am very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam tarikuni.
I didn't mean anything by that.	Chaywanqa manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
It goes fast.	Utqaylla rin.
And then you knew what you wanted to do.	Hinaspa chaymanta yacharqanki ima ruway munasqaykita.
He was unconscious.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kasqa.
It would have been there.	Chaypim kanman karqa.
And there it is.	Hinaspa chaypi kachkan.
I think it’s out there somewhere.	Yuyaykuni maypipas hawapi kasqanmanta.
I have it now too.	Ñoqapas kunanmi chaytaqa hap’ini.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
This is the supreme truth.	Kaymi aswan hatun cheqaq kaq.
He told me not to do anything.	Paymi niwarqa ama imatapas ruwanaypaq.
Obviously, there’s a big one though.	Sut’inmi, kanmi hatun ichaqa.
Other than that, it should be fine.	Mana chaymantaqa, allinmi kanan.
I hope you do too.	Suyachkani qampas chayta ruwanaykipaq.
Most people are like that.	Yaqa llapan runakunam chayna.
He started saying something.	Imatapas niyta qallaykurqa.
Two years later.	Iskay wata qhepamanmi.
He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chayta atipayta atirqanchu.
I didn’t see him.	Manam paytaqa rikurqanichu.
I want better.	Aswan allintam munani.
How beautiful she is.	Imayna sumaqmi pay.
He knows there is more to it than that.	Yachanmi chaymanta aswan kasqanmanta.
But at the moment, this is the worst part.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa kaymi aswan mana allinqa.
He has a lot here.	Payqa achkatam kaypi kachkan.
And then he looked at her.	Hinaspa chaymanta payta qhawarisqa.
The most important thing here is the people.	Kaypiqa aswan allinqa runakunam.
I hope at the end of the summer.	Suyachkani chiri killa tukukuypi.
Maybe one day.	Ichapas huk punchaw.
Who is.	Pitaq.
I’m not the important thing.	Manam ñuqachu kani chay importante kaq.
What is the current state of the art?	¿Imaynataq kunan pacha?
Nothing there, either.	Mana imapas chaypiqa, nitaq.
Why is he.	¿Imanasqataq payqa.
A young man, he said.	Huk wayna, nispas nin.
He couldn’t stop her now.	Payqa manan kunanqa hark’ayta atirqanchu.
He knows why he is there.	Payqa yachanmi imarayku chaypi kasqanmanta.
He wants to know how.	Payqa yachayta munan imaynatachus chayta.
After that it’s up to you.	Chay qhepamanmi qanmanta kanqa.
It could have been easier.	Aswan facilmi kanman karqa.
He couldn't say what he was saying.	Payqa manan imachus nisqanman hinaqa rimayta atirqanchu.
Then and where and.	Chaymanta hinaspa maypi hinaspa.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Yacharqanim mana allin kananta.
I mean it was good.	Allinmi kasqa niyta munani.
It was as big as the first one.	Ñawpaq kaq hina hatunmi karqa.
Something though.	Imapas ichaqa.
The best part there is this.	Chaypi aswan allinqa kaymi.
They have a bad attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
This year’s event was a great success.	Kay wata ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
You are a very nice person.	Ancha sumaq runam kanki.
She’s actually really nice.	Payqa chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi.
You’re crazy, man.	Loco kanki, runa.
He does it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwan.
You are ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam kachkanki.
I didn’t expect that.	Mana chayta suyarqanichu.
I would probably do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwayman.
It’s faster.	Aswan utqaylla.
They weren’t very happy with me.	Paykunaqa manan ancha kusisqachu karqanku ñoqawanqa.
It won’t be me.	Manam ñuqachu kasaq.
Three and a half.	Kimsa kuskan.
Almost like this.	Yaqa kay hina.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim ruwayta atisqaykita.
I didn’t really know what was going to happen.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imakuna pasananta.
That may not be a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá mana allinchu kanman.
I’m not afraid of anything.	Mana imatapas manchakuni.
Now he can't walk.	Kunanqa manam puriyta atinchu.
I didn’t want it to happen again.	Manam munarqanichu hukmanta chayna kananta.
In fact, he is one.	Aswanpas payqa hukninmi.
I want to know if that’s the case.	Chayna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I’m a good girl.	Allin sipasmi kani.
This is the new thing.	Kaymi musuq kaq.
Is everything all right?	¿Allinchu tukuy imapas?
He was the one.	Payqa karqan.
I couldn’t figure it out either.	Ñuqapas manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
Otherwise, you’re not going to do that.	Mana chayqa, manan chaytachu ruwanki.
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
We can’t wait any longer.	Manañam suyayta atichwanchu.
They are not human beings.	Manam runachu kanku.
It’s not very good.	Manam ancha allinchu.
If only she could believe him.	Sichus payta creeyta atinman chayqa.
Anywhere.	Maypipas.
I don’t know if it’s not.	Mana yachanichu icha manachu.
Now they have their minds.	Kunanqa yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
This very but he did.	Kay ancha ichaqa paymi ruwarqan.
I don't want to think about it tonight, not anymore.	Manam kunan tutaqa chaypi yuyaymanayta munanichu, manañam.
Maybe he’ll do that.	Ichapas chaynata ruwanman.
Obviously something went wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin pasasqanmanta.
But, how does it work? 	Ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq?
It was easier to never have him.	Aswan facilmi karqa mana haykapipas paywan kayqa.
I heard them all.	Llapallankum uyarirqani.
He couldn’t face the reality of his expulsion.	Payqa manan atipayta atirqanchu qarqosqa kasqanmanta cheqaq kaqta.
You know better than you do.	Qanmi aswan allinta yachanki.
I’ll be there, too.	Ñuqapas chaypim kasaq.
But it won’t be.	Ichaqa manan kanqachu.
The process is constant.	Chay ruwayqa sapa kutillanmi.
It shouldn’t go that way.	Manan chay hinachu rinan.
She said it was too cold.	Payqa nirqam llumpay chiri kasqanmanta.
Here it is, right here.	Kaypi kachkan.
I hope he doesn’t go.	Suyachkani mana rinanpaq.
I don’t know how bad it is.	Manam yachanichu imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe two months.	Ichapas iskay killa.
It made him do nothing.	Chayqa manaña imatapas ruwananpaqmi ruwarqa.
But it is not certain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu.
I know what these things are like.	Yachanim kaykunaqa imayna kasqanmanta.
It’s either good or bad.	Allinmi icha mana allinchu.
He is there now.	Payqa kunanmi chaypi kachkan.
Today he finally couldn't come.	Kunan punchawmi tukukuypi mana hamuyta atirqachu.
Maybe it will be time one day.	Ichapas huk punchaw tiempo kanman.
He hasn’t done anything yet.	Payqa manaraqmi imatapas ruwanchu.
If something is wrong, it is wrong.	Sichus imapas mana allinchu chayqa, manan allinchu.
But surely a wonderful player.	Ichaqa seguro huk sumaq pukllaq.
Isn't it really something.	Manachu chiqaptapuni imapas.
Do your best, he says.	Tukuy atisqaykita ruway, nispas nin.
That was a good speech.	Chay rimayqa allinmi karqa.
Nothing will happen to what happened in the past.	Ñawpaqpi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam imapas kanqachu.
Not bad or good.	Mana mana allinchu nitaq allinchu.
This is a complicated process.	Kayqa huk sasachakuy ruwaymi.
What is it for you?.	¿Imataq qampaq?.
It was like building a house.	Chayqa wasi ruway hinam karqa.
And it’s very early.	Hinaspa ancha temprano.
It’s really good.	Chiqamanta allin.
No new ideas.	Mana musuq yuyayniyuq.
That’s how good this is!.	¡Chayna allinmi kay chay!.
I want to help you, he said.	Yanapayta munani, nispa.
So how to do it.	Chaymi imaynatataq ruwana.
I don’t really know who they are.	Manam allintachu yachani pikuna kasqankuta.
He came here to the party.	Kayman hamurqa fiestaman.
I really want to fix that.	Chaytaqa chiqaptam allichayta munani.
But he must be alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kanan.
This is the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi.
I’m not always happy.	Mana hinam sapa kuti kusisqa kani.
No one knows what will become of him.	Manan pipas yachanchu paymanta imachus kananta.
Do a better job.	Aswan allin llamkayta ruway.
I have a very positive attitude.	Ñuqaqa ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
Maybe there’s something there.	Ichapas chaypi imapas kanman.
That will come much later.	Chayqa aswan qhepamanmi hamunqa.
It may well be very good for you.	Allinmi kanman ancha allin qampaq.
The fact of the matter is this.	Chiqap kaqmi kaymi.
But nothing was so innocuous that night.	Ichaqa manan imapas chhayna mana ima mana allinchu karqan chay tutaqa.
This is what it is.	Kayqa kanmi.
There is nothing of the kind there.	Chaypiqa manan imapas chay hinaqa kanchu.
I am absolutely sure of that.	Ñuqaqa chaymantaqa chiqaptam seguro kani.
At the time, it would have been.	Chay tiempopiqa, chayna kanman karqa.
This doesn’t make any sense.	Kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I've just been badly hurt.	Chayraqmi llumpayta k'irisqa kani.
She was a good girl.	Payqa allin sipasmi kasqa.
I don't know exactly where it is.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmanta, nispa.
I have to be there.	Chaypi kanay tiyan.
But how do you do that.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq chayta ruwanki.
But he didn’t stay there long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu chaypi qhepakurqan.
There is a.	Kanmi huk.
He never existed.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
It’s a bigger one.	Aswan hatunmi.
It is usually best to say nothing.	Yaqa llapanpim aswan allinqa mana imatapas niy.
And that’s a good thing, actually.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
I loved him, I loved this.	Payta anchata munarqani, kayta anchata munarqani.
It still doesn't have a great idea.	Kunankamapas manam hatun yuyayniyuqchu.
He is a man of tomorrow.	Payqa paqarin runam.
I did that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwaq kani.
He can't go.	Payqa manan riyta atinchu.
So tell me the truth.	Chaymi cheqaq kaqta willaway.
It went well enough.	Allintam rirqa.
He refused to talk about what happened.	Payqa manan munarqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta rimayta.
I can’t say that for sure.	Manam chaytaqa allintachu niyta atiyman.
I was set up.	Ñuqaqa churasqa karqani.
He sure looked familiar.	Payqa segurom riqsisqa rikchakurqa.
I have always thought about it.	Sapa kutim chaypi piensarqani.
He was a really good guy.	Payqa chiqaptam allin runa karqa.
Which would be nice.	Imataq sumaq kanman.
He is the best.	Paymi aswan allinqa.
This is the best part.	Kaymi aswan allin kaq.
I still have never heard of it.	Kunankamapas manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu.
Now this is the problem.	Kunanqa kaymi sasachakuy.
Say that now.	Chaynatam kunan niy.
Get the job done.	Llamkayta ruway.
All right, that’s it.	Allinmi, chaymi.
I want to say something.	Imatapas niyta munani.
I almost feel sorry for him.	Yaqapaschá paymanta llakikuni.
There was one recently.	Hukninmi karqa chayllaraq.
Yes, it is here.	Arí, kaypim kachkan.
Said it used to be beautiful.	Nisqa ñawpaq sumaq kasqanmanta.
So I’m the one.	Chaymi kani.
I don't think this is true.	Manam kayqa chiqap kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
Never has such a simple task been so difficult.	Manan hayk’aqpas chhayna sasa ruwayqa chhayna sasachu karqan.
Of course, he didn’t really want to see her.	Arí, payqa manan anchatachu rikuyta munarqan.
I’m sorry it’s cold.	Pampachaykuway chiri kasqanmanta.
That process is not yet available.	Chay ruwayqa manaraqmi kanchu.
I don’t know how he did it.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He looked like twenty.	Payqa iskay chunka hinata qhawarisqa.
Why on earth is it so difficult.	Imaraykutaq kay pachapi ancha sasa.
No, it’s not there.	Manan, manan chaypichu.
That’s sadly good.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi allin.
He knew exactly what had just happened.	Payqa allintam yacharqa chayllaraq imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I think that was him.	Chayqa pay kasqanmantam piensani.
He was sure no one thought so.	Payqa segurom karqa mana pipas chaynata piensasqanmanta.
But you can’t say the word anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chay simitaqa rimayta atiwaqchu.
I love driving a car.	Anchatan munani carrota manejayta.
A lot of things happened today.	Kunan punchawmi achka imakuna pasarqa.
He knew it would happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay pasananta.
He wouldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
It can be very difficult.	Ancha sasam kanman.
Please go here.	Ama hina kaspa kayman riy.
Even so, I will be here.	Chayna kaptinpas kaypim kasaq.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Payqa nirqam chaymanta mana imatapas yachasqanmanta.
You know what to do and what not to do.	Yachanki ima ruwanaykita, imata mana ruwanaykita.
This did some good.	Kayqa wakin allinta ruwarqa.
But, of course that means nothing to anyone.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi chayqa manan pimanpas imatapas niyta munanchu.
Yes, I was a part of it.	Arí, ñuqapas chaymanta hukninmi karqani.
Two good years.	Iskay allin wata.
Something, someone was there with him.	Imapas, pipas chaypi paywan kasqa.
I actually don't feel too good.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha allintachu sientekuni.
He cannot know anything about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yachayta atinmanchu.
He is like a very famous person.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa runa hinam kachkan.
Being here now.	Kunan kaypi kaspa.
It really wasn't bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
It doesn’t really make sense.	Manam chiqaptaqa imapaqpas valenchu.
It could have been better though.	Aswan allinmi kanman karqan ichaqa.
That’s a good thing about it.	Chayqa allinmi chaymantaqa.
Say, once a week.	Niy, semanapi huk kutita.
A few years ago.	Iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqta.
Does anyone really know.	¿Pipas chiqaptachu yachan.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.
Some other things.	Wakin huk imakuna.
He is not a morning person.	Payqa manam paqarin runachu.
Do this, don’t do that.	Kayta ruway, ama chayta ruwaychu.
Nothing was right here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
No longer a good person.	Manaña allin runa.
It’s not just me.	Manam ñuqallachu.
He wasn’t a human being.	Manam runachu karqa.
That time.	Chay kuti.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don't care how many there are.	Manam imananpaschu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
That should be the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi kanan.
I was in town every night.	Sapa tutan llaqtapi karqani.
That’s what you did.	Chaytan ruwarqanki.
But then something happened.	Ichaqa chaymantam imapas pasarqa.
He knew the weather was bad.	Payqa yacharqanmi tiempo mana allin kasqanmanta.
Yeah, he’s very, very good.	Arí, payqa ancha, ancha allinmi.
But he didn’t want to stop her.	Ichaqa manan hark’ayta munarqanchu.
He knows there aren't that many.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayna achka kasqanmanta.
But that doesn't make sense.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa imapaqpas valenchu.
I knew he meant it.	Yacharqanim chayta niyta munasqanmanta.
Sorry for being late.	Pampachaykuway tarde kasqaymanta.
It’s very good for me.	Ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
It wouldn’t have been right.	Manam allinchu kanman karqa.
He could not see them.	Chaykunataqa manam rikuyta atirqachu.
Please tell me.	Ama hina kaspa willaway.
He was drunk.	Payqa machasqa kasqa.
But where he is right now, he’s a very good player.	Ichaqa maypichus kunan kashan chaypiqa ancha allin pukllaqmi.
I can't remember anywhere else.	Mana maypipas hukmanta yuyariyta atinichu.
Little did he know the future would be like this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hamuq tiempo chhayna kananta.
He knew now.	Payqa kunanqa yacharqanmi.
He longed to be alone.	Payqa anchatan munarqan sapallan kayta.
One of them was worse.	Hukninmi aswan mana allin karqa.
All alone.	Tukuy sapallan.
That’s the next big thing.	Chayqa qatiqnin hatun kaqmi.
Or real people.	Utaq chiqap runakuna.
He said he wanted to see it again and again.	Payqa nirqam yapamanta yapamanta qawayta munasqanmanta.
I didn’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu.
The bad thing is.	Mana allin kaq.
You never knew it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu.
Disappointed now and then, for sure.	Hukmanyasqa kunan chaymanta, seguro.
I’ve been here before!	¡Ñawpaqtaqa kaypi karqani!
You might want to think about that.	Chaytaqa ichapas yuyaymanayta munanki.
You can't be here without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam kaypi kayta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t do anything!	¡Manan imatapas ruwarqanichu!
Fast and furious.	Utqaylla hinaspa phiñasqa.
I can’t stop thinking about it.	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta saqiyta atiymanchu.
That was fucking crazy.	Chayqa karqan millay loco.
He does that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwan.
I have this idea that he is happy.	Ñuqaqa kay yuyayniyuqmi kani kusisqa kasqanmanta.
There’s a chance he’ll win.	Kanmi chansa pay atipananpaq.
A man who speaks the truth.	Huk runa chiqap rimaq.
We can’t answer it.	Manam kutichiyta atichwanchu.
You’re a great guy.	Hatun runam kanki.
Who knows what.	Pi yachan imata.
That would still be a good thing.	Chayqa kunankamapas allinmi kanman.
There are three types of wealth.	Kimsa laya qhapaq kaymi kan.
So that was pretty big for me.	Chaymi chayqa ancha hatun karqa ñuqapaq.
He noticed her feelings for him.	Payqa repararqanmi paywan imayna sientekusqanmanta.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
But there was nothing he could do.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
All those people at home.	Tukuy chay runakuna wasipi.
He was great though.	Payqa hatunmi karqan ichaqa.
It would have been too much, too soon.	Llumpay, ancha utqaylla kanman karqa.
But one came out.	Ichaqa hukninmi lluqsirqa.
I won't do it again.	Manañam hukmanta ruwasaqchu.
He is the one.	Paymi.
It seemed kind of.	Chayqa rikchakurqa huk laya.
He says he’s happy.	Kusisqa kasqayta nin.
He couldn’t answer.	Payqa manan kutichiyta atirqanchu.
He didn’t want to see anyone.	Payqa manan pitapas rikuyta munarqanchu.
These people would have been better off without me.	Kay runakunaqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan mana ñoqawanqa.
I wanted to talk more.	Astawan rimayta munarqani.
I want to be better.	Munani aswan allin kayta.
If this is what you want.	Sichus kayta munanki chayqa.
Everything with you is new.	Qamwan tukuy imapas musuq kaqmi.
But then that’s the first.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chay ñawpaq kaq.
This is really hard for me.	Kayqa chiqaptam sasa ñuqapaq.
It’s been working for a long time.	Unayñan llank’ashan.
I said the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan nirqani.
A couple of years, he said.	Iskay kimsa wata, nispa.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chayqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
He is doing it well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwachkan.
Now that’s saying.	Kunanqa chay nispa.
I think that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispaymi.
he asked me, smirking.	nispa tapuwarqa.
Less than you.	Qammanta aswan pisi.
But he can do that.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanman.
I’d rather go with you.	Aswan allinmi kanman qanwan riy.
I was the next person.	Qatiqnin runam karqani.
So that’s what happened.	Chaymi chayna pasarqa.
There’s a smile on his face.	Chaypin kashan.
I still don't know who or what is to blame.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu pikuna utaq imakuna huchayoq kasqanmanta.
He needs immediate help.	Payqa usqhayllan yanapayta necesitan.
I am a new person.	Ñuqam musuq runa kani.
I did as he said.	Nisqanman hinam ruwarqani.
Do this every night for ten days.	Chaytaqa sapa tuta chunka punchaw ruway.
There really isn't any of this.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas kayqa kanchu.
We did it once.	Huk kutitam ruwarqayku.
And he’s here with us.	Hinaspa payqa kaypi kachkan ñuqaykuwan.
There he is wounded.	Chaypin k'irisqa kashan.
Once again one.	Huk kuti huk.
Every day is a new day.	Sapa punchawmi musuq punchaw.
Maybe again.	Ichapas yapamanta.
It will be the last time, the last chance.	Qhipa kuti, qhipa chansa kanqa.
There was never anyone else.	Manam haykapipas huk runaqa karqachu.
But he never really did.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
In fact, it would actually be quite simple.	Chiqaptaqa, chiqaptaqa ancha facilmi kanman.
Don’t miss this opportunity, he said.	Ama kay oportunidadta qunqaychu, nispas nisqa.
And he’s going to go.	Hinaspa payqa rinqa.
He wasn’t good enough.	Payqa manan allinchu karqan.
They disagreed.	Paykunaqa mana acuerdopichu karqanku.
You know, it was amazing.	Yachanki, admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He wouldn't have done anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas ruwanmanchu karqa.
Seriously, don’t ever do something like this.	Serio, ama hayk’aqpas kay hinata ruwaychu.
But I don’t remember anything about this.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yuyarinichu kaymanta.
One of them is mine.	Hukninmi ñuqapa.
I want it for some reason.	Imaraykupas munani.
I have no idea what’s wrong.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
That anyone can be.	Pipas kayta atisqanmanta.
Actually, it’s a bit sad.	Chiqaptaqa, huk chikan llakikuypaqmi.
He can’t do it fast enough.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu ruwayta atin.
They were here for a very long time.	Paykunaqa ancha unayñam kaypi karqaku.
He speaks alone.	Payqa sapallanmi riman.
It can be considered a giant giant.	Huk hatun hatun hina qhawarisqa kanman.
You want to be human.	Runa kayta munanki.
I learn more every day.	Sapa punchawmi astawan yachani.
I want to tackle that one day.	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi atipayta munani.
Often, but what is this supposed to do.	Sapa kuti, ichaqa imatataq kay ruwanan tiyan.
Really, really, really furious.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, chiqamanta millay phiñasqa.
Good and bad.	Allin hinaspa mana allin.
They are not there.	Paykunaqa manan chaypichu kashanku.
I can’t stop it anymore.	Manañam harkayta atinichu.
No one else does that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
That was right there.	Chayqa chaypim karqa.
Don’t be unreasonable.	Ama mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
Then a month later.	Chaymanta huk killa.
However, it is not good.	Ichaqa, mana allinmi.
If you want to have a serious conversation, do it right.	Sichus munanki huk serio rimayta, allinta ruway.
All the whole way.	Tukuy tukuy ñanta.
I still don’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manaraqmi creenichu.
I can’t think straight.	Manam allintachu yuyaymanayta atiyman.
And then that wasn’t good enough.	Hinaspa chaymanta chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
How can someone be so stupid? 	¿Imaynataq pipas chayna sonso kanman?
Who knows.	Pi yachan.
I do that a lot.	Chaytaqa anchatam ruwani.
You would, of course.	Qamqa, chiqaptam ruwawaq.
I feel the same way.	Ñuqapas chaynatam sientekuni.
Everyone knows it will never happen.	Lliwmi yachanku mana haykapipas chayna kananta.
They were arrested.	Paykunaqa hap’isqa karqanku.
It was just that.	Chayllaraqmi karqa.
It’s really always there for me.	Chiqamanta sapa kuti ñuqapaq kachkan.
What a tragedy it was.	Ima llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He just got out of there.	Chayllaraqmi chaymanta lluqsirqa.
But it’s not like this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu.
They are just that.	Paykunaqa chaylla kanku.
But I was lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi karqani.
Nobody does it.	Manan pipas ruwanchu.
The process was not difficult.	Chay ruwayqa manan sasachu karqan.
That’s what a person does.	Chaytan huk runaqa ruwan.
And one last year.	Hinaspa huk qayna wata.
He was in a state of shock.	Payqa llakisqa tarikurqa.
I’ve seen a lot of it.	Anchatam rikurqani.
He thought nothing of it.	Payqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
I’m very good at that.	Chaypiqa ancha allinmi kani.
It should be here.	Kaypi kanan tiyan.
But, he had to do something here first.	Ichaqa, kaypi ñawpaqtaqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I had a lot to do.	Achka ruwanay karqa.
The man is a great man.	Chay runaqa hatunmi.
Do it right, and you’ll do it right.	Chaytaqa allinta ruway.
But I’d rather not.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman mana.
I know these things.	Chaykunataqa yachanin.
I am very sorry about that.	Anchatam llakikuni chaymanta.
Everything was fine, everything was good.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa, tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
No one wants to stop him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta munanchu.
Have a great appearance.	Hatun rikchayniyuq kay.
It was such a good thing.	Chayna allinmi karqa.
I’m supposed to be the one.	Ñuqam chayna kanay.
I have to do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan ruwanay.
I just didn’t do it.	Chaylla mana ruwarqanichu.
Anything more here.	Imapas aswan kaypi.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Manam imatapas mikuyta atirqanichu.
He didn’t do it now.	Payqa manan kunanqa ruwarqanchu.
I think about that a lot.	Chaypiqa anchatam piensani.
I really, really did.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta ruwarqani.
So here we are.	Chaymi kaypi kachkaniku.
He didn't know what to do to help her.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta yanapananpaq.
Something will be fine.	Imapas allinmi kanqa.
But they weren’t there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu karqanku.
He has always been very talented.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ancha yachaysapa karqa.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Allintam yacharqani imakuna pasananta.
He couldn't sit still.	Mana imatapas ruwaspa tiyayta atirqachu.
Maybe he can.	Ichapas atinman.
I don’t mean exactly.	Manam allintachu niyta munani.
Instead, I was a little surprised.	Aswanpas huk chhikantan admirakurqani.
It wasn’t the same there.	Chaypin huk hinachu karqan.
Please, I'll be with you.	Ama hina kaspa, qanwan kasaq.
That wouldn’t make things worse.	Chayqa manan imatapas aswan mana allintachu ruwanman.
I never knew who he was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pi kasqanmantaqa.
He was right there.	Payqa allintam chaypiqa karqa.
It was a cold night.	Chayqa chiri tutam karqa.
No one knows how to do that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwaytaqa yachanchu.
That’s fucking good.	Chayqa millay allinmi.
Then again, you still probably don’t think it’s that funny.	Chaymanta yapamanta, kunankamapas manapaschá chay hina asikunapaq hinachu yuyaykunki.
There it was again.	Chaypim yapamanta karqa.
You can’t say that.	Manam chaytaqa rimayta atiwaqchu.
Or?.	Icha?.
You want to tell.	Willayta munanki.
Can’t do more.	Mana aswan ruwayta atinchu.
Beautiful thing.	Sumaq kaq.
It’s neither good nor bad.	Manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
I know it was for me.	Yachanim ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
He could work with it.	Chaywanmi llamkayta atinman karqa.
Just then, things went wrong.	Chaylla, imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I was extremely large.	Ñuqaqa sinchi hatunmi karqani.
No one would ever do that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
Otherwise I wouldn’t be here.	Mana chayqa manam kaypichu kayman.
That’s good about it.	Allinmi chaymanta.
That was the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi karqan.
I am there now.	Kunanqa chaypim kachkani.
But three times.	Ichaqa kinsa kutitan.

He knew no one could hear him.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana pipas uyariyta atisqanmanta.
The man was injured.	Chay runaqa k'irisqa.
This is definitely the best year for me.	Kayqa chiqamanta aswan allin wata ñuqapaq.
That was the only thing.	Chayllam karqa.
Still things weren't easy.	Hinallam imapas mana facilchu karqa.
So, that’s what we did.	Chaymi, chayta ruwarqayku.
I knew it was the only thing.	Yacharqanim chaylla kasqanmanta.
It wasn't the best, but it was good.	Manam aswan allinchu karqa, ichaqa allinmi karqa.

He didn’t think it would be a problem.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chay ruway sasachakuy kananta.
It’s okay to want what you want.	Munasqaykita munaspaqa allinmi.
No one was ever sure.	Manam pipas haykapipas segurochu karqa.

I don’t want it here.	Manam kaypichu munani.
He came here yesterday	Qayna punchawmi kayman hamurqa
No one was happy about this.	Kaymantaqa manam pipas kusisqachu tarikurqa.
I mean it’s pretty cool.	Niyta munani ancha sumaq kasqanmanta.

But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
Everything turned out great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi lluqsirqa.
How did he say that.	Imaynataq chayta nisqa.
Never, never, never.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
Now you have to do something about him.	Kunanqa paymanta imatapas ruwanayki.
I’m actually a human being.	Chiqaptaqa runam kani.
I hope it is.	Suyachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
He doesn't know who he is.	Payqa manam yachanchu pi kasqanmanta.
Ultimately he is just that.	Qhepamanmi payqa chaylla.
He knew, she knew he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, payqa yacharqanmi pay yachasqanmanta.
He did it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.

Anyway, that’s it for me.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymi ñuqapaq.
In other words, he did.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, chaynatam ruwarqa.
Again, the	Hukmanta.
However, this is still important.	Ichaqa, kayqa hinallam ancha allin.
So yeah, okay, that was a good thing.	Chaymi arí, allinmi, chayqa allinmi karqa.

I couldn’t see it.	Mana rikuyta atirqanichu.

It’s really bad right now.	Chiqap mana allinmi kunan.
He wanted to know more about her.	Payqa paymanta astawan yachayta munarqa.
I thought you knew how to be better than that.	Chaymanta aswan allin kayta yachasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
You want to be as wrong as he is.	Pay hina pantasqa kaytam munanki.
He had to be here somewhere.	Payqa maypipas kaypi kanan karqa.
He had been arrested a few times.	Payqa iskay kinsa kutitan hap’isqa karqan.
There are some people.	Wakin runakunaqa kanmi.
Or it was something.	Utaq imapas karqan.
Are you all right?' 	¿Allinchu kachkanki?’, nispa.

He was as scared as a boy.	Payqa huk wayna hinan mancharisqa kasqa.
No, that’s something.	Manan, chayqa imapas.
The man was one of a kind.	Chay runaqa huk kaqmi karqa.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
This sounds good.	Kayqa allinmi uyarikun.
I couldn’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atirqanichu.
That’s because he’s here to make that movie.	Chayqa kanqa chay peliculata ruwananpaq kaypi kasqanmanta.
That’s this three-month period.	Chayqa kay kimsa killa pacha.
So there is nothing.	Chaymi mana imapas kanchu.

But this was worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
I think he’s done well.	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqanmanta.
Fast, hard, hard.	Utqaylla, sinchita, sinchita.
I wanted to see it all.	Tukuy chayta rikuyta munarqani.
He knew that was wrong but he couldn't do anything about it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay mana allin kasqanmanta ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.

But there it is.	Ichaqa chaypiqa kanmi.
It was a very bad experience.	Ancha mana allinmi karqa.

Do you know where this is?	¿Yachankichu maypi kay kasqanmanta?
That’s as safe as it can be.	Chayqa seguro kanman hina seguro kanman.
So far it's doing really well.	Kunankamaqa chiqap allintam ruwachkan.

So, the reality.	Chaymi, chiqap kaq.

He might have been arrested.	Payqa yaqapaschá hap’isqa kanman karqan.
I don't care how long it takes.	Manam imananpaschu hayka tiempo pasasqanmantaqa.
This was a wonderful day.	Kay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It was really interesting.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq karqa.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
But that’s pretty crazy.	Ichaqa chayqa sumaq loco.
But it was worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
But it’s still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkan.
But it was too good for him.	Ichaqa llumpay allinmi karqa paypaq.
You are doing the right thing with that.	Chaywanqa allintam ruwachkanki.
He can’t stand it.	Payqa manan aguantayta atinchu.
I’m not like you.	Manam qam hinachu kani.
He couldn't figure out where he was.	Manas maypi kasqanmanta yachayta atirqachu.
I don't remember when.	Manam yuyarinichu haykapi.
But.	Ichaqa.
It is a very common practice.	Chayqa ancha riqsisqa ruwaymi.
So much of that.	Chaymi achka chaymanta.
Even so, it's too early.	Chayna kaptinpas, ancha temprano.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
Tell me what you did today.	Kunan punchaw ima ruwasqaykita willaway.
In a month.	Huk killapi.
It’s so easy now.	Kunanqa ancha facilmi.
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
They want him to be taken seriously.	Paykunaqa munanku allinta qhawarisqa kananta.
I thought about the house.	Chay wasipi yuyaykurqani.
Did you know they existed.	Yacharqankichu kasqankuta.
And how he knew that.	Hinaspa imaynatas chayta yacharqan chayta.
But it is difficult to do many things well.	Ichaqa sasam achka ruwaykunata allinta ruwayqa.
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa allinmi chayqa.
Who is this guy?	¿Pitaq kay runa?
He will never do it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu.
But we are lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kayku.
He would have loved to be here today.	Payqa anchatan munanman karqan kunan p’unchay kaypi kananpaq.
I had a girl to help.	Huk sipasmi karqan yanapanaypaq.
Not yet, not quite.	Manaraq, mana allintachu.
Someone said his name.	Pipas sutinta nisqa.
It makes no sense to you.	Manam imapaqpas kanchu qampaq.
I knew what was going to happen.	Yacharqanim ima kananta.
What was it that happened.	Imataq karqa.
Later he spoke again.	Qhepamanmi yapamanta rimarqan.
You will never have to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwanayki kanqachu.
But certainly anything can happen.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin imapas kanman.
Being put together with him.	Paywan kuska churasqa kay.
Almost a night.	Yaqa huk tuta.
This is going to be very difficult.	Kayqa ancha sasam kanqa.
You’re tired, yes.	Sayk’usqañan kashanki, arí.
Bad weather or something.	Mana allin pacha utaq imapas.
It’s like this.	Kay hinam.
No one knows why or how.	Manan pipas yachanchu imarayku nitaq imaynatachus chayta.
I won't be able to keep up with you today.	Kunan punchawqa manam qamwan kuska puriyta atisaqchu.
But it will be here soon enough.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan kaypi kanqa.
I really want to talk.	Anchatan munani rimayta.
I don’t want anything.	Manam imatapas munanichu.
This is the reality.	Kaymi chiqap kaq.
He wouldn’t be there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kanman karqan.
It's a good day for that.	Chaypaqqa allin punchawmi.
And that was about it.	Hinaspa chaymi chaymanta karqan.
They were here.	Paykunaqa kaypim karqaku.
What! 	Ima!
I saw it once or twice.	Huk kuti iskay kutitam rikurqani.
Maybe he would have done that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman karqa.
He was right the first time.	Payqa allintan rimarqan ñawpaq kutipi.
I didn’t want more than I had.	Manam ñuqapa kasqanmantaqa aswan achkata munarqanichu.
I’ve always wanted to know about this.	Kaymantaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yachayta munarqani.
He is the same person.	Payqa kikin runan.
He’s been there for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan chaypi kashan.
No one here would do that.	Kaypiqa manam pipas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
If this is the case, do so.	Kayna kaptinqa chayta ruway.
Will you join us?.	¿Ñoqaykuwan kuskachu kanki?.
Most of the people here are very nice.	Kaypi yaqa llapan runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
She really wants to be with him.	Payqa anchatam munan paywan kayta.
So this is the first step.	Chaymi kayqa ñawpaq kaq ruway.
He could never catch her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas hap’iyta atirqanchu.
He didn't need her around.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu paywan kuska kananta.
He is the richest man in this town.	Paymi kay llaqtapi aswan qhapaq runa.
But I am getting better every day.	Ichaqa sapa punchawmi aswan allinta ruwachkani.
It's kind of a mystery.	Chayqa huk laya pakasqa hinam.
This is the latter.	Kayqa qhipa kaqmi.
Better not forget that.	Aswan allinmi chayta mana qunqaychu.
But if you do nothing, nothing will happen.	Ichaqa mana imatapas ruwanki chayqa, manan imapas kanqachu.
I think you did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqaykita.
He was taller than me.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
Surely, this was a good time.	Chiqamanta, kayqa allin pacha karqa.
So we’re proud of that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa orgulloso kayku.
You certainly do.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanki.
So it will come from there.	Chaymi chaymanta hamunqa.
He knew that, if anyone knew.	Chaytaqa yacharqanmi, sichus pipas yacharqan chayqa.
He wasn't quite sure what to do now.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan kunan ima ruwananta.
Are you ready?.	¿Listochu kachkanki?.
So, there you go.	Chaymi, chaypi kanki.
He couldn't help but ask.	Payqa manam mana tapuyta atirqachu.
But everything remained the same.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.
I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
Tell me what you want.	Willaway ima munasqaykita.
I have no idea how it is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kasqanmanta.
The more he said it, the better.	Astawan chayta nisqanman hinaqa aswan allinmi karqan.
You can't get away with this.	Kaymantaqa manam lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
He is always there for me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq kachkan.
It would make a good game, this would.	Allin pukllayta ruwanman, kayqa ruwanman.
He is good enough to play this role.	Payqa allinmi kay ruwayta ruwananpaq.
She’s young and beautiful.	Payqa wayna, sumaqmi.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I tried to do things.	Imakunatapas ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
The best ever.	Aswan allin hayk’aqpas.
Not disagreeing with you there.	Mana chaypi qanwan mana acuerdopichu.
First it wasn’t true.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
Things could have been worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan imapas.
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
He is very good to me.	Payqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
I wanted money.	Qolqetan munarqani.
I really don’t know what’s best.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu imachus aswan allin kaqta.
Maybe a little less.	Ichapas huk chikan pisi.
Perhaps he had something to learn about her.	Yaqapaschá karqa paymanta imakuna yachananpaq.
In one conclusion.	Huk tukukuypi.
The bad guys are good.	Mana allin runakunaqa allinmi.
Very true.	Sinchi chiqap.
I know you can't talk about it.	Yachanim chaymanta mana rimayta atisqaykita.
This looks really nice.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
And another one a week later.	Hinaspa hukta huk semana qhepaman.
That moment.	Chay rato.
I think you've done a good job.	Allin llamk'ayta ruwasqaykita yuyani.
I’m not here to be funny.	Manam asikunapaq hinachu kaypi kachkani.
That is probably the best thing to do.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allin ruwayqa kanman.
Obviously, he doesn’t need much.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan anchatachu necesitan.
I agree but now there was a reason.	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani ichaqa kunanqa karqa imaraykupas.
This, not so much.	Kay, mana anchatachu.
They had to be.	Paykunaqa kanan karqan.
He held the door for her.	Payqa punkuta hap’irqan paypaq.
Would you like to go with me?	¿Munawaqchu ñuqawan riyta?
I don’t know if anyone got hurt.	Manam yachanichu pipas k’irisqa kasqanmantaqa.
It happened about ten years ago.	Yaqa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
I was sure something was wrong.	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
They are beautiful.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi kanku.
He did it as quickly as the first.	Chaytaqa ñawpaq kaq hina usqhayllan ruwarqan.
I don't know what time it is.	Manam yachanichu ima hora kasqanmantaqa.
Sick as a sick man.	Unqusqa hina unqusqa.
He was like a child.	Payqa wawa hinam karqa.
Is he still mad at you?	¿Hinallaraqchu qampaq phiñasqa kachkan?
I would never do that now.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqan.
Now is the time to act.	Kunanmi imatapas ruwananchikpaq tiempo.
I mean, it couldn't be worse.	Niyta munani, manam aswan mana allinchu kanman.
He didn’t want that that after all.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chay chayta tukuy imamanta.
You can’t do that now.	Kunanqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I know where they are.	Yachanim maypi kasqankuta.
The injured one.	K’irisqa kaq.
So he said it would be good.	Chaymi allin kanman nispa nirqa.
He and she together.	Paywan paywan kuska.
Very hard, but very young.	Ancha sinchi, ichaqa ancha wayna.
This is not an easy thing for me to do.	Kayqa manam facilchu ñuqapaq ruwayqa.
I want to sit down.	Tiyayta munani.
This is going to be a big deal, man.	Kayqa hatun ruwaymi kanqa, runa.
It makes no sense,’ he repeated.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu’, nispas yapamanta nisqa.
I have not seen this before.	Kaytaqa manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
This is a bad practice.	Kayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
I couldn’t do anything else.	Manam hukta ruwayta atirqanichu.
I want to talk to him today.	Kunan punchawmi paywan rimayta munani.
Three to a school.	Kimsa huk yachay wasiman.
Seriously would love to hear from you.	Serio anchata munani uyariyta qanmanta.
Now I’m not sure what happened to it.	Kunanqa manan segurochu kani imachus chaywan pasasqanmanta.
But maybe it’s that good.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna allin kanman.
Why couldn’t he do anything? 	¿Imanasqataq mana imatapas ruwayta atirqachu?
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
I’m not sure yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu kani.
A driver in a car.	Huk carropi puriq.
That is obviously wrong.	Chay ruwayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
He looked out the window.	Payqa ventanata qhawarisqa.
He asked the question.	Paymi tapurqan.
This didn't matter.	Kayqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
This is almost every day.	Kayqa yaqa sapa punchawmi.
There is indeed evil.	Cheqaqtapunin mana allinqa kan.
I’m not happy, he says.	Manam kusisqachu kani, nispas nin.
Everything about him was huge.	Paymanta tukuy imapas hatun hatunmi karqa.
He said something, but she couldn't hear him.	Imatapas nirqam, ichaqa manam uyariyta atirqachu.
I know you are faster than me.	Yachanim ñuqamanta aswan utqaylla kasqaykita.
He is fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kachkan.
I don’t know who else it might be.	Mana yachanichu pikuna huk kanman chayta.
That's already a big deal.	Chayqa ñam hatun ruwaymi.
It was a good thing he didn’t.	Allinmi karqan mana ruwasqanqa.
This man is very sick.	Kay runaqa ancha unqusqa kachkan.
It still sounds good.	Kunankamapas allinmi uyarikun.
She knew what he meant.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.	Yacharqanim mana facilchu kanman karqa.
I was really happy with it, actually.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani chaywan, chiqaptaqa.
They were both very happy.	Iskayninkum ancha kusisqa karqaku.
He didn’t really know what to expect.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imachus suyasqanmanta.
Being human is good.	Runa kayqa allinmi.
But he probably would have.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanman karqan.
What a stupid thing to do.	Ima sonso ruwaymi.
So this is what.	Chaymi kayqa ima.
Most people are not up to it.	Yaqa llapan runakunaqa manam chayman hinachu kanku.
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
One, two, many.	Huk, iskay, achka.
First time here.	Ñawpaq kuti kaypi.
He had no choice about who he was.	Payqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu pi kasqanmantaqa.
Now he had no choice.	Kunanqa manañam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
Maybe a.	Ichapas huk.
He told me things were busy.	Paymi niwarqa imapas ocupasqa kasqanmanta.
One thing was wrong.	Huk kaqmi mana allin karqa.
Maybe, it looks good.	Ichapas, allinmi rikchakun.
Like, really, really.	Imayna, chiqap, chiqap kaq.
Do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruway.
One day, though.	Huk punchawmi ichaqa.
I wasn’t good either.	Ñuqapas mana allinchu karqani.
That is as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam.
Not like this morning.	Mana kunan paqarin hinachu.
And, you know right about that.	Hinaspa, chaymantaqa allintam yachanki.
I went to talk to him.	Paywan rimaq rirqani.
I felt proud and happy.	Orgulloso hinaspa kusisqam tarikurqani.
I think this is the right thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi nispan yuyaykuni.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.
To be with me.	Ñoqawan kanaypaq.
He was exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
He did something.	Imatapas ruwarqa.
It was a great one.	Hatunmi karqa.
It wouldn’t be an easy task.	Manan facil ruwaychu kanman.
Now I think that is the case.	Kunanqa chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
He wouldn’t want this to happen.	Payqa manan munanmanchu kay hina kananta.
But they were very big about it.	Ichaqa ancha hatunmi karqanku chaymanta.
Who will be the best?	¿Pitaq aswan allin kanqa?
I’m sure this won’t be the last time.	Seguro kayqa manan qhepa kutichu kanqa.
Maybe more than that.	Ichapas aswan achka.
I had a very great day.	Ancha hatun punchawmi karqani.
All the time two.	Tukuy pacha iskay.
Actually, thank you.	Chiqaptaqa, gracias.
Otherwise you will never be able to see it.	Mana chayqa manam haykapipas qawayta atiwaqchu.
I think that's his name.	Chayqa sutinmi nispaymi piensani.
However, this approach does not seem to work.	Ichaqa manan kay ruwayqa allinchu rikch’akun.
That’s if you want to help.	Chayqa sichus yanapayta munanki chayqa.
He says it’s.	Paymi nin.
He didn’t have to do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwananchu karqan.
And it’s beautiful.	Hinaspa sumaqmi.
This could go nowhere.	Kayqa manam maymanpas riyta atirqachu.
This thing is difficult.	Kay imapas sasam.
You knew that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam yacharqanki.
It would be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman.
This is important, he says.	Kayqa ancha allinmi, nispan nin.
They were married.	Paykunaqa casarasqa karqanku.
After that, you’re on your own.	Chay qhepamanmi sapallayki kanki.
This isn’t going to be like every other time.	Kayqa mana sapa huk kuti hinachu kanqa.
But that wouldn’t always be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chayqa kanman karqan.
That’s what he had to do.	Chaytan ruwanan karqan.
This can be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I know what he thinks.	Yachanim ima piensasqanmanta.
If he’s like most everyone else, he’ll come eventually.	Sichus payqa yaqa llapan llapa runa hina kanman chayqa, qhepamanmi hamunqa.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But there was a chance.	Ichaqa huk chansa karqan.
I really need that to happen.	Anchatam necesitasaq chayna kananta.
This is by no means the only option.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas chayllachu chay ruwayqa.
He seems very sure.	Payqa ancha seguro hinam kachkan.
But it’s him.	Ichaqa paymi.
The man is a good man.	Chay runaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
It’s a very sad thing.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi.
I can certainly talk to you.	Cheqaqtapunin qanwan rimayta atiyman.
And that’s the bottom line.	Hinaspa chaymi tukuy imamantapas aswan allinqa.
I know who he is.	Yachanim pi kasqanmanta.
He had no idea who he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu pichus kasqanmanta.
I know it was too soon.	Yachanim ancha utqaylla kasqanmanta.
They want to talk about beauty.	Sumaq kaymanta rimayta munanku.
He was happy it went so well.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan ancha allinta risqanmanta.
There is no more food.	Manaña mikhuy kanchu.
He was alone there.	Chaypiqa sapallanmi karqa.
What a wonderful experience that was!	¡Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa!
He knew what he had to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
It was an amazing day.	Chay punchawqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
No one knows how many there are.	Manam pipas yachanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
Who did most of the work?	¿Pitaq yaqa llapan llamkayta ruwarqa?
I don't think this is right.	Kayqa manam allinchu kasqanmantam piensani.
I wanted to do one too.	Ñuqapas hukta ruwayta munarqani.
Better go, he says.	Aswan allinmi riy, nispas nin.
He was supposed to be a baseball player.	Payqa béisbol pukllaqmi kanan karqan.
He can’t go to the gym.	Mana riyta atinchu.
This is not a dual process.	Kayqa manam iskay ruwaychu.
If you want to contact us, that’s fine.	Sichus ñuqaykuwan rimayta munanki chayqa, allinmi.
But I don’t understand why you want to do this.	Ichaqa manan entiendenichu imaraykun kayta ruwayta munanki chayta.
But they seemed happy.	Ichaqa kusisqa hinan karqanku.
It's always a big deal.	Sapa kutim hatun ruwaymi.
I don't feel so good right now.	Kunanqa manam ancha allinchu tarikuni.
I kept going.	Hinallam rirqani.
To be accepted by me.	Ñoqa allinpaq qhawarisqa kanaypaq.
Very happy, yes.	Ancha kusisqa, arí.
That was a man.	Chayqa huk runam karqa.
He says it went well.	Payqa allintam rirqa nin.
But who needs it.	Ichaqa pitaq necesitan.
Where we are.	Maypi kanchik.
A new challenge every day.	Sapa punchaw musuq sasachakuy.
That’s why it’s here.	Chayraykum kaypi kachkan.
Here is a way to do that.	Kaypi huk ruwaymi kachkan chayta ruwanapaq.
And, anyway.	Hinaspa, imayna kaptinpas.
Again, very easy.	Yapamanta, ancha facil.
That’s the thing though.	Chayqa chay kaqmi ichaqa.
He knew he had no choice.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana ima ruwaytapas atisqanmanta.
Never heard of it, never seen it.	Mana hayk’aqpas uyarirqanichu, mana hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu.
Like, man good.	Imayna, runa allin.
But they are not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kashanku.
Not maybe then.	Mana ichapas chaymanta.
It still looks great.	Kunankamapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Say that to be true.	Chayta niy cheqaq kananpaq.
Do you think it will succeed?	¿Qanpa yuyayniykipiqa allintachu ruwanqa?
This is where I lived.	Kaypim yacharqani.
Being alone is a great thing.	Sapallan kayqa ancha allinmi.
Things went well.	Imapas allintam rirqa.
If you think about it.	Sichus yuyaykunki chayqa.
I am very proud of that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso kani.
Not at all.	Mana imapipas.
I still don't know what to do.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
I have taken this role for many years.	Achka watañam kay ruwayta hapini.
I don't see how it can be bad for you.	Manam rikunichu imaynatam mana allin kanman qampaq.
You made him do it.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi ruwarqanki.
What a time, what a time.	Ima pacha, ima pacha.
But it would be a bad thing to do.	Ichaqa mana allin ruwaymi kanman.
You may not have known that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yacharqankichu.
Do it quickly.	Usqhaylla ruway.
But he never stayed that long.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa unaytachu qhepakurqan.
I take a listen.	Huk uyariyta hap’ini.
More on that here.	Astawan chaymanta kaypi.
Don't like it.	Ama gustanchu.
These are beautiful.	Kaykunaqa sumaqmi.
That was always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
And you do that, again and again.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanki, yapamanta yapamanta.
He really couldn't do that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqachu.
Everything seemed easy.	Tukuy imapas facil hinam karqa.
I just didn’t want to.	Chayllam mana munarqanichu.
Great evil deed.	Hatun millay ruway.
So the man did as he was told.	Chaymi chay runaqa nisqanman hina ruwarqa.
I’m a player.	Pukllaqmi kani.
It just had to happen.	Chayllaraqmi chayna kanan karqa.
And the first one.	Hinaspa ñawpaq kaq.
Obviously, someone was.	Sut’inmi, pipas karqan.
He was obviously very disappointed.	Payqa sut’inmi ancha hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
It’s going to be pretty difficult.	Allin sasa kanqa.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
Everything is there.	Tukuy imapas chaypim kachkan.
I wish I knew what it was.	Munaymanmi ima kasqanmanta yachayta.
There are a lot of people.	Achka runakunam kachkan.
In fact, this is not always the case.	Chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu chayna kan.
I haven’t seen him in a long time.	Unayñan mana paytaqa rikunichu.
I thought you were right.	Ñuqaqa allintam nisqaykita piensarqani.
There was something there.	Chaypin imapas kasqa.
That says something.	Chayqa imatapas ninmi.
Don't forget anything.	Ama imatapas qunqaychu.
Everyone knows that.	Lliwmi chaytaqa yachanku.
Indeed,	Chiqamanta,
Again and then again.	Yapamanta chaymanta yapamanta.
He did what he wanted to do.	Munasqanman hinam ruwarqa.
He was happy that he did.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa chayna ruwasqanmanta.
I have been waiting for thirty years.	Kimsa chunka watañam suyachkani.
I saw a way.	Huk ñanta rikurqani.
I don’t want to give up.	Manam saqiyta munanichu.
Would you like to come?	¿Munawaqchu hamuyta?
You are a very beautiful girl.	Huk ancha sumaq sipasmi kanki.
But it’s not there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu.
It’s really great.	Chiqap hatunmi.
I did the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan ruwarqani.
What harm could it do?	¿Ima mana allintan ruwanman?
It’s a good idea.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi.
I can’t tell you enough about everything he did.	Manam allintachu willayta atiyman tukuy ima ruwasqanmanta.
I’m not happy about anything.	Manam imamantapas kusisqachu kani.
He loved being a kid.	Payqa anchatan munarqan wawa kayta.
He was always really good to me.	Payqa sapa kutim chiqap allin karqa ñuqapaq.
And everything went well.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas allinta rirqa.
He doesn’t like to help.	Payqa manan gustanchu yanapayta.
We’re good, we’re a lot of good.	Allinmi kayku, achka allinmi kayku.
He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I don’t feel comfortable right now.	Kunanqa manam allinchu tarikuni.
He couldn’t have left.	Manam ripuyta atinmanchu karqa.
If it is true.	Chiqap kaptinqa.
I think he is.	Yuyaykuni pay.
I don’t need it for that, thank you.	Manam chaypaqqa necesitasaqchu, gracias.
I meant to say that.	Chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
But maybe it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa ichapas mana chayna facilchu kanman.
If you know why, let me know.	Imarayku chayta yachanki chayqa, willaway.

It would be really new if it existed.	Chiqamanta musuq kanman sichus kanman chayqa.
He would probably do it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman.

This was a few months ago.	Kayqa karqa iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.

But he knew it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi.
That took it out of me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta hurqurqa.
I don’t feel that sick.	Manam chayna unqusqa hinachu tarikuni.
I don’t like it either.	Ñuqapas manam gustanchu.
He couldn't see anything.	Payqa manam imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.

If that’s true, great.	Sichus chay cheqaq kanman chayqa, hatunmi.

Today was a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allinmi karqa.
Do whatever you want to do.	Ima ruwaytapas ruway.
But it wasn’t going to work out.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanan karqan.
So this is how it was supposed to be.	Chaymi kayna kanan karqa.
Things went on like this for several days.	Achka punchawmi imapas chaynata pasarqa.
I think you’ll be fine.	Allinmi kanki nispaymi piensani.
But that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
He wanted to know.	Payqa yachayta munarqanmi.
The worst thing you can do.	Aswan mana allin ruway.
Maybe that would be better.	Ichapas chayqa aswan allin kanman.
But this is a really big thing.	Ichaqa kayqa chiqap hatun ima.
I can’t agree with you.	Manam acuerdopi kayta atiymanchu.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.

I knew he knew everything about me.	Yacharqanim ñuqamanta tukuy imata yachasqanmanta.

Okay, it’s bigger.	Allinmi, aswan hatun.
No, this is not true.	Manan, kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
The truth is, he was right.	Chiqap kaqmi, payqa allintam nirqa.
The boy younger than him.	Paymanta sullk’a kaq wayna.
I’m happy here.	Kaypi kusisqa kachkani.
However, it doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa, mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I think it’s true.	Chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
He doesn't know why.	Payqa manam yachanchu imanasqa chaytaqa.
That’s the process.	Chay ruway.
We’re sure he’s guilty.	Seguro kayku huchayoq kasqanmanta.
He was the handsomest man there.	Payqa chaypi aswan sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa.
Since then.	Chaymanta pacha.
It means to do.	Ruway niyta munan.
That’s what’s going to have to be done.	Chayqa ruwana kanqa.
They are ridiculous.	Paykunaqa asikunapaq hinam kanku.
Not really good.	Mana chiqap allinchu.
He can’t stay here.	Payqa manan kaypi qhepakuyta atinchu.
She can no longer hear him.	Manañam paytaqa uyariyta atinchu.
Unless otherwise specified, .	Mana huk nisqa kaptinqa, .
You are a teacher.	Qamqa yachachiqmi kanki.
I didn’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
Therefore, we must take action.	Chayraykum imatapas ruwananchik.
Do this in two steps.	Chayta iskay ruwaykunata ruway.
So, you know, he’s kind of a big deal.	Chaymi, yachanki, payqa huk laya hatun ruwaymi.
I know he is.	Yachanim payqa kasqanmanta.
There is no one like him.	Pay hinaqa manam pipas kanchu.

More than anything else?	¿Astawan imamanta?
He likes it a lot.	Paytaqa anchatam gustan.

But not always.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu.
This is a very real thing.	Kayqa ancha chiqap kaqmi.
I can do it right.	Allintam ruwayman.
But it may not mean much.	Ichaqa manapaschá anchatachu niyta munan.
We did everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqayku.
He had an idea.	Payqa huk yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Nothing can stop him now.	Kunanqa manan imapas hark’ayta atinmanchu.
He passed quickly.	Payqa utqayllam pasarqa.
I was so mad, so tired.	Ancha loco, ancha sayk’usqa karqani.
The lonely man.	Sapallan runa.
Rather then ever.	Aswanpas chaymanta hayk’aqpas.
Now I wonder what will happen.	Kunanqa imachus kanqa nispa tapukuni.
Perhaps it is recent.	Yaqapaschá chayllaraq kachkan.
I was exhausted.	Sayk’usqañan karqani.
I didn’t do that right.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu ruwarqani.
I guess the best way to do this.	Suyachkani aswan allin ruway kayta ruwanapaq.
He can be a little lonely.	Payqa huk chhikanta sapallan kayta atin.
It should be there.	Chaypim kanan.
She couldn't believe it would happen again.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu hukmanta chay pasananta.
But it’s like doing something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruway hinan.
I still think about it today.	Kunankamapas chaypim piensani.
The second step is to	Iskay kaq ruway.
We are very proud of him.	Anchatan paymanta orgulloso kayku.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima ruwasqanmanta.
I don’t want to go out with anyone.	Manam piwanpas lluqsiyta munanichu.
A lot of it’s not good.	Achka mana allinchu.
I know you are excited about it.	Yachanim chaymanta kusisqa kasqaykita.
For the most part, what he did was nothing.	Yaqa llapanpim ruwasqanqa mana imapas karqachu.
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hinaqa.
But this is what needs to be done.	Ichaqa kaytan ruwana.
You can’t beat that.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiwaqchu.
But I like it there.	Ichaqa chaypiqa gustanmi.
You, that’s it.	Qam, chaymi.
He’s never like this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu.
He decided to find out what was going on.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imachus kasqanmanta yachayta.
No, he wouldn’t do that.	Manan, manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
I really want to know.	Anchatam munani yachayta.
Every night of the week.	Semanapi sapa tuta.
They have a point of view.	Paykunaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I will never do it.	Manam haykapipas ruwasaqchu.
But he didn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwarqanchu.
But I can’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwayta atiyman.
He was proud of what he did	Payqa orgulloso karqan chay ruwasqanmanta
I don’t think so.	Manam chayna yuyayniyuqchu kani.
These are people.	Kaykunaqa runakunam.
I'll be here.	Kaypim kasaq.
I don’t want to be someone else.	Manam huk runa kayta munanichu.
So, it’s very good.	Chaymi, ancha allin.
This is not the best way.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu.
Maybe I would have done something else.	Ichapas huk ruwaytapas ruwasaq karqa.
They want it here.	Kaypim munanku.
I wasn’t sure if it was right.	Manam segurochu karqani allinchu icha manachu.
I didn’t listen to him.	Manam paytaqa uyarirqanichu.
This doesn't mean anything.	Kayqa manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
He doesn't care about that.	Payqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​chayta.
Would anyone like to tell me what happened?	¿Pipas willayta munanmanchu imakuna pasasqanmanta?
That was a little difficult.	Chayqa huk chhikantan sasa karqan.
I went to school this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi yachay wasiman rirqani.
Then, the other one.	Chaymanta, huknin.
He's been here all weekend.	Payqa tukuy semana tukuyta kaypi kachkan.
I didn’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munarqani.
He died an hour later at a hospital.	Huk hora qhepamanmi huk hospitalpi wañupurqan.
He can’t drive a car.	Payqa manan carrota manejayta atinchu.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
You are an individual.	Sapa runam kanki.
I was very excited.	Ancha kusisqam karqani.
Express your disagreement.	Mana acuerdopi kasqaykita willay.
No one knows exactly who he is.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan pichus kasqanmanta.
He’s not a terrible person.	Payqa manan manchay runachu.

Maybe someone is worse.	Ichapas pipas aswan mana allinqa.
They want that.	Chaytaqa munanku.
He's right there.	Payqa allintam chaypiqa kachkan.
I’m waiting ahead of time.	Ñawpaqtaraqmi suyachkani.
That’s what he wanted.	Chaynatam munarqa.
I didn’t want to talk to him either.	Ñoqapas manan paywan rimayta munarqanichu.
I am here this morning to tell you a story.	Kunan paqarinmi kaypi kachkani huk willakuyta willanaypaq.
Repeat the process.	Chay ruwayta yapamanta ruway.
I was very sure of it.	Ancha segurom karqani chaymanta.
She couldn't believe how scared she really was.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu cheqaqtapuni imayna mancharisqa kasqanpi.
I never knew this would happen.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kayna pasananta.
Do the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruway.
He wanted to be very famous.	Munarqa ancha riqsisqa kayta.
He can make it better.	Payqa allin kananpaqmi ruwanman.
The funny thing is, it’s easier.	Asikunapaq hinaqa, aswan facilmi.
He barely could.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana atirqanchu.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
I’ll be young with you.	Qanwan kuska wayna kasaq.
It was a very good thing to do.	Ancha allin ruwaymi karqan.
He knew he would be arrested.	Payqa yacharqanmi hap’isqa kananta.
I can’t answer it.	Manam kutichiyta atiymanchu.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
It wasn't going to last long.	Manam unaytachu kanan karqa.
So far it’s been good.	Kunankamaqa allinmi.
Now I know what he’s thinking.	Kunanqa yachanin ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
You have no idea how much.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki hayk’a kasqanmanta.
This isn’t your case.	Kayqa manan qanpa hinachu.

It’s a very good thing that it is.	Ancha allinmi chayna kananpaq.
I wish there were more out there.	Munaymanmi chay hawapi aswan achka kananpaq.
He quickly reconsidered.	Payqa usqhayllan hukmanta yuyaykurqan.
So that would have been funny.	Chaymi chayqa asikunapaq hina kanman karqan.
You’re not sure.	Mana segurochu kanki.
I thought of a new coin.	Musuq qullqita yuyaykurqani.
He was tired and hungry.	Payqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima kasqa.
I don't know what's in it.	Manam yachanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
I have no idea how he did it.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna ruwasqanmanta.
That’s what happened.	Chaynatam pasarqa.
And the week before.	Hinaspa chay semana ñawpaqtaqa.
I have no idea he didn’t want to.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani mana munasqanmanta.
I know every action.	Sapa ruwaymi yachani.
It was obvious they were worried.	Sut’inmi karqan llakisqa kasqankuta.
Maybe you have an idea.	Ichapas huk yuyayniyuq kanki.
I'll be good to you.	Allintam qampaq kasaq.
He knows he can do it.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
They want to do things.	Paykunaqa imakunatapas ruwayta munanku.
Can’t really do that right now.	Mana chiqamanta chayta ruwayta atinchu kunanpacha.
It’s not safe.	Manam segurochu kachkan.
Not quite sure.	Mana allintachu seguro.
Now it's every day.	Kunanqa sapa punchawmi.
I didn’t have that much time.	Manam chayna tiempoy karqachu.
As a result, things can go wrong.	Chayraykum imapas mana allinchu kanman.
I still couldn't see it.	Kunankamapas manam rikuyta atirqanichu.
You can't see him.	Manam paytaqa qawayta atiwaqchu.
He was obviously nervous.	Payqa sut’inmi mancharisqa kasharqan.
The first one was easy.	Ñawpaq kaqmi facil karqa.
Something doesn’t sound right.	Imapas mana allintachu uyarikun.
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
He was more than just that.	Payqa manan chayllachu karqan aswanpas.
Can you help ?.	¿Atiwaqchu yanapayta ?.
He stayed there.	Payqa chaypi qhepakurqan.
Thank you, that was nice of you.	Gracias, chayqa sumaqmi karqan qanmanta.
Make everything seem so easy.	Tukuy imata ancha facil hina kananpaq ruway.
Now, however, he is no longer there.	Kunanmi ichaqa manaña kanchu.
I know why it is.	Yachanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He has to do that or he does nothing.	Chaytan ruwanan mana chayqa manan imatapas ruwanchu.
They seemed to do that a lot.	Chaytaqa achkata ruwaq hinam karqaku.
It will come in a different way.	Huk hinam hamunqa.
Clearly he is.	Sut’inmi payqa kashan.
Nothing was the same as before.	Manan imapas ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
For some reason.	Imaraykupas.
I didn't really think this through.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani.
At least I don’t believe it.	Aswanpas manan creenichu.
He looked sick.	Unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
We can't do it here.	Kaypiqa manam ruwayta atichwanchu.
I know you are a good person.	Yachanim allin runa kasqaykita.
It was better, better.	Aswan allinmi karqan, aswan allinmi karqan.
He wasn’t a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu karqa.
It should actually be black.	Chiqaptaqa yana kanan.
It makes it easier.	Aswan facil kananpaqmi ruwan.
He certainly did his best.	Cheqaqtapunin tukuy atisqanman hina ruwarqan.
He will go with you.	Payqa qanwan kuskan rinqa.
He was such a nice guy.	Payqa chayna sumaq runam karqa.
I'd rather check it out.	Aswan allinmi kanman chayta qawayta.
Eventually I did.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqani.
He didn't look very good.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
He got drunk too, too fast.	Payqa llumpay, llumpay utqayllam machasqa.
Today is the day to do something.	Kunan punchawmi imatapas ruwananchikpaq.
It happened so fast.	Chayna utqayllam pasarqa.
He wasn't sure what happened next.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imakuna qhepaman pasasqanmanta.
That was going to be the really hard part.	Chayqa chiqap sasa kaqmi kanan karqa.
This is actually quite simple.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa ancha facilmi.
He doesn’t think about it.	Payqa manan chaypichu yuyaykun.
Who’s in the box? 	¿Pitaq chaypi kachkan?
A few years ago, that wasn’t the case.	Iskay kinsa wata ñawpaqtaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
So cold though.	Chayna chiri ichaqa.
It’s sad that this is going to happen.	Llakikuypaqmi kayna kananmanta.
He didn’t know what they were.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imakuna kasqankuta.
Good looking anyway.	Allin rikchayniyuq imayna kaptinpas.
It’s been a long time.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi.

He died a week later.	Huk semana qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
What a strange man.	Ima mana riqsisqa runa.
That’s something, he thinks.	Chayqa imapas, nispas yuyaykun.
Every year there’s bad weather or something.	Sapa wata mana allin pacha kan utaq imapas.
That did it, hard.	Chayqa ruwarqa, sinchita.
He lives here.	Kaypim tiyan.
I thought you knew.	Yachasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I wish I could stop playing this game now.	Munaymanmi kunan kay pukllayta saqiyta.
Not.	Mana.
This was the last moment on earth.	Kaymi karqan kay pachapi qhepa kaq rato.
I knew that was the case.	Chaytaqa yacharqanim.
I was a schoolteacher.	Yachay wasipi yachachiqmi karqani.
A lonely week.	Huk sapallan semana.
It’s there but it’s not.	Chaypin kashan ichaqa manan.
He looks so cold and sad.	Payqa ancha chiri llakisqa rikchakun.
Maybe someone left some food.	Ichapas pipas wakin mikuyta saqirqa.
What he meant by that.	Ima niyta munarqa.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Ichaqa chaymanta rimayta munarqa.
I can’t get out of here yet.	Manaraqmi kaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
And the third time.	Hinaspa kinsa kaq kutipi.
That is a very good thing to do.	Chayqa ancha allin ruwaymi.
And every year, it'll never be me.	Hinaspa sapa wata, mana hayk'aqpas ñuqachu kasaq.
But he is a great man.	Ichaqa hatun runam.
I'm pretty uncomfortable here.	Kaypiqa allintam mana allinchu kachkani.
He is right about that.	Payqa allintam chaymantaqa rimachkan.
Now this is it.	Kunanqa kaymi.
I know they are there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta.
But, that’s what he needs.	Ichaqa, chaytan necesitan.
But maybe there won’t be another time.	Ichaqa ichapas mana kanqachu huk kutipi.
He was a very intelligent man.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He did the right thing.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan.
Maybe it’s a good thing it’s not so bad.	Ichapas allin kanman mana chayna mana allinchu.
I don't remember anything there.	Chaypiqa manam imatapas yuyarinichu.
But there is no future, not really.	Ichaqa manan hamuq tiempo kanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
That would continue to be the case.	Chayqa hinallam kanman.
I didn’t know when or how it would happen.	Manam yacharqanichu haykapi hinaspa imayna pasananta.
It’s a good school day.	Allinmi yachay wasi punchaw.
It doesn’t matter. 	Manam imananpaschu. 
Nothing,’ he said quickly.	Mana imapas’, nispas usqhaylla nisqa.
Two years, maybe three.	Iskay wata, ichapas kimsa.
But he never did that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He always failed.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Pretending to be an everyday thing would not be easy.	Sapa punchaw imapas hina ruwayqa manam facilchu kanman.
I never gave it much thought.	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa anchatachu piensarqani.
There was no way he could do that.	Manan imapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He really wants to talk.	Payqa chiqaptam rimayta munan.
There is good practice there.	Chaypin kan allin ruway.
The less the merrier!	¡Aswan pisi kaptinqa aswan kusisqam!
I had those things.	Chaykunataqa karqani.
There were a lot of people.	Ancha achka runakunam karqaku.

You know you can.	Yachankim atisqaykita.
I can't tell you when.	Manam willayta atiymanchu haykapi.
This is certainly a feature.	Kayqa cheqaqtapunin huk ruway.
He’s still able to.	Payqa hinallam atin.
It’s about you, it’s about me.	Qammanta, ñuqamanta.
He was amazing.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.

Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas qamqa kanki.
All day long.	Tukuy punchaw.

Now hurry up!	Kunanqa usqhaylla!
But he is happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kachkan.
I thought it was funny.	Asikunapaq hina kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
It was a good way to get the job done.	Allinmi karqa chay llamkayta ruwanapaq.
Tell me what happened, he said.	Willay imakuna pasasqanmanta, nispa.
The school year will be difficult again.	Yachay wata yapamanta sasa kanqa.
I don't know if this can work.	Mana yachanichu kay llamk'ayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
It feels like home.	Wasi hinam sientekuni.

He couldn’t be serious.	Payqa manan serio kayta atirqanchu.
I mean, it does .	Niyta munani, chayta ruwan .
But you go all the way backwards.	Ichaqa tukuy ñanta qhepamanmi rinki.
That he had to take that first step and do something.	Chay ñawpaq kaq llank’ayta ruwanan kasqanmanta, imatapas ruwanan kasqanmanta.
And then, something bad happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta, imapas mana allin pasarqa.

Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi karqa.

But he didn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa nirqanchu.
I’m the one he wants.	Ñuqam pay munan.

Sad but true.	Llakisqa ichaqa chiqap.
He certainly didn’t seem worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana llakisqa hinachu karqan.
Do this several times a day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi achka kutita ruwanayki.
That said, it’s not all bad.	Chayta nispa, mana tukuy mana allinchu.
So, however, it is not a good thing.	Chaymi ichaqa mana allinchu.
He had to do it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwanan karqan.
Make the time to do it.	Tiempota ruway.
But he knew it was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
And that’s something.	Hinaspa chayqa imapas.
I don’t know what I did wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin ruwasqaymanta.
It should be clear.	Sut’inmi kanan.
Which would have been wrong.	Imataq mana allin kanman karqa.
So there’s something there.	Chaymi chaypi imapas kachkan.
Everyone was worried.	Lliwmi llakisqa karqaku.
They were so wrong.	Chayna pantasqa karqaku.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
That makes sense now.	Chayqa kunanqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
We have been here for a very long time.	Ancha unayñam kaypi kachkaniku.
They were, after all, very impressive.	Paykunaqa, tukuy imamanta, ancha admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
I want what’s real.	Munani imachus chiqap kaqta.
I want to hear that.	Chayta uyariyta munani.
Not always though.	Mana sapa kutichu ichaqa.
I’m a little worried.	Huk chikan llakisqa kachkani.
Say thank you.	Gracias niy.
I don’t say no to that word.	Manam chay simitaqa manachu.
He's been here before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kaypi karqa.
I really like this one.	Kayqa anchatam gustan.
That was it, it’s not.	Chayqa karqan, manañan.
It looks really great.	Chiqap hatunmi rikchakun.
Now, don't forget.	Kunanqa, ama qunqaychu.
It still is, actually.	Hinallam kachkan, chiqaptaqa.
No, he couldn’t remember the game.	Manan, manan chay pukllayta yuyariyta atirqanchu.
He goes well.	Payqa allintam rin.
He’s the one who speaks.	Paymi rimaq.
He just came out in the real world.	Payqa chayllaraqmi chiqap pachapi lluqsirqa.
Hurt and sad.	K’irisqa hinaspa llakisqa.
Don't ever forget.	Ama hayk'aqpas qunqaychu.
He looks very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa rikch’akun.
So, that’s a good thing.	Chaymi, chayqa allinmi.
I’m just feeling a little tired.	Chayllaraqmi huk chhikanta sayk’usqa tarikuni.
They were never human.	Paykunaqa manan hayk'aqpas runachu karqanku.
Faster and faster.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan utqaylla.
I feel better there and then.	Aswan allinta sientekuni chaypi chaymanta chaymanta.
The first one is simple.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana sasachu.
In the world.	Kay pachapi.
Please eat well.	Ama hina kaspa, allinta mikhuy.
You know this is true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachanki.
Be sure of that.	Chaytaqa seguro kay.
I don’t want to wait.	Manam suyayta munanichu.
The event went very well.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allintam rirqa.
She said, it’s great.	Payqa nisqa, ancha allinmi.
He acted like nothing was his.	Payqa mana imapas paypaq hinam ruwarqa.
But that’s just not true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu chaylla.
But it’s yours.	Ichaqa qanpa kaqmi.
I know what the problem is.	Yachanim ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I heard the story again.	Chay willakuyta hukmanta uyarirqani.
But he spoke every day.	Ichaqa sapa p’unchaymi rimaq.
Do it every day.	Sapa punchaw ruway.
Yes, he was right there.	Arí, payqa allintam chaypiqa karqa.
Eventually he does.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwan.
It was really sad.	Chiqap llakikuypaqmi karqa.
They are terrified of everything.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kachkanku.
And it’s even more beautiful.	Hinaspa aswan sumaq.
Being a teacher must be hard.	Yachachiq kayqa sasam kanan.
More about this.	Astawan kaymanta.
Everything else does.	Tukuy imapas ruwan.
One two, one two.	Huk iskay, huk iskay.
I can’t wait to do it.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu chay ruwaytaqa.
He must continue to do so.	Hinallam ruwanan.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqan.
Are you sure about this?.	¿Segurochu kanki kaymanta?.
It will be bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kanqa.
It was a good thing for me.	Allinmi karqa ñuqapaq.
They are here all the time.	Paykunaqa tukuy tiempon kaypi kashanku.
He came very often.	Payqa ancha sapa kutim hamurqa.
Then next month.	Chaymanta hamuq killapi.
There was no other way to do it.	Manam huk ruwayqa karqachu.
That's how it should go, at least.	Chaynatam rinan, aswanpas.
There is no place here.	Kaypiqa manam maypipas kanchu.
Then the third.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq.
But there was something else to do.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi karqan.
So thank you, me.	Chaymi gracias, ñoqa.
I didn’t know you were out there.	Mana yacharqanichu hawapi kasqaykita.
I sure didn’t do it.	Seguro mana ruwarqanichu.
Where have you been?	¿Maypitaq karqanki?
I think this time will be good.	Kay kuti allin kananpaqmi yuyaykuni.
I could be there all night.	Tukuy tutan chaypi kayman.
I didn’t want to sleep yet.	Manaraqmi puñuyta munarqanichu.
They are always there for me.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq kachkan.
You are a good person.	Qamqa huk allin runam kanki.
There is nothing better.	Manam aswan allinqa kanchu.
It’s not as easy as it looks.	Manan qhawarisqa hina facilchu.
No one seemed sure.	Manam pipas seguro hinachu karqa.
Go to your house.	Wasiykiman riy.
Being a mistake.	Pantasqa kay.
They seem pretty safe.	Paykunaqa allin seguro hinam kanku.
Now I want it here.	Kunanqa kaypim munani.
He is not here today.	Payqa manam kunan punchawchu kaypi kachkan.
He didn’t need that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa necesitarqanchu.
That's, well, never.	Chayqa, allinmi, mana hayk'aqpas.
A month at most.	Huk killa aswan achka.
But this is not true of the fact.	Ichaqa kayqa manan cheqaqchu kasqanmantaqa.
Does it mean that.	Chaynatachu niyta munan.
That was going to fail.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwanan karqan.
We never disagree.	Manam haykapipas mana acuerdopichu kayku.
Now do it.	Kunanqa ruway.
No one really knows.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa yachanchu.
I wasn’t there for that.	Chaypaqqa manam chaypichu karqani.
It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
That will likely happen soon.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayllaraq kanqa.
There are a lot of good people here.	Kaypiqa achka allin runakunam kachkan.
But he didn't think he would.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwananta.
He couldn't say anything.	Manas imatapas niyta atirqachu.
But that doesn’t make it a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa mana allinchu.
It will be difficult anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas sasam kanqa.
Someone asked me to tell you this.	Pipas kayta willanaypaq niwarqa.
He wanted to be with her.	Payqa paywan kaytam munarqa.
Last year’s performance.	Qayna wata ruway.
But you never know.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
Nothing to make time for.	Mana imapas tiempota ruwanapaq.
For now, anyway.	Kunankamaqa, imayna kaptinpas.
Nothing will ever be right.	Manan hayk’aqpas imapas allinchu kanqa.
He wasn't sure who did it.	Manam segurochu karqa pikuna ruwasqanmanta.
She couldn't wait for the party.	Payqa manan chay fiestata suyayta atirqanchu.
That’s a nice thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi.
This is what it looks like.	Kaymi chay rikchakun.
But I don’t think he will.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykunichu chayta ruwananta.
If you don’t want to buy it.	Mana rantiyta munaspaqa.
He doesn’t though.	Payqa manan ichaqa.
I couldn’t go anywhere.	Manam maymanpas riyta atirqanichu.
She refused to talk to him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan rimayta.
These are not available.	Manam kaykunaqa kanchu.
This was a failure.	Kayqa huk mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
He certainly couldn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana atirqanchu.
They are both good people.	Iskayninkum allin runakuna kanku.
There with you.	Chaypi qanwan kuska.
Later I learned what it was like outside.	Qhepamanmi yacharqani hawapi imayna kasqanmanta.
Please more, more.	Ama hina kaspa aswan, aswan.
He had to be.	Payqa kanan karqan.
That seems pretty simple.	Chayqa ancha facilmi rikchakun.
It wouldn’t have been easy.	Manan facilchu kanman karqan.
You can’t do better than me.	Manan atiwaqchu ñoqamanta aswan allinta ruwayta.
Probably say no.	Yaqapaschá mana niy.
The back of the house.	Wasi qhipa.
I couldn’t understand why he didn’t.	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imanasqa mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wanted to do something to stop it.	Mana chayta ruwananpaqmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
The same truth.	Kikin kaq chiqap.
But this is a big deal.	Ichaqa kayqa hatun ruwaymi.
That's where it gets tricky.	Chayqa chaypim sasachakuypi tarikun.
There is something.	Imapas kanmi.
But they’re both there.	Ichaqa iskayninkun chaypi kashanku.
That would be amazing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman.
Here are some of them.	Kaypi wakin.
Many things.	Achka imakuna.
He looked at it carefully.	Allinta qhawarisqa.
They are a lot of good.	Paykunaqa achka allinmi kanku.
It wouldn't have been that difficult.	Manam chayna sasachu kanman karqa.
This will cause a reset.	Kayqa huk kutichiyta ruwanqa.
But it’s really not that hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chhayna sasachu.
It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allinmi.
You look so pathetic!	¡Ancha llakikuypaqmi rikchakunki!
I knew you wanted time with him.	Yacharqanim paywan tiempota munasqaykita.
There is nothing like it today.	Kunan pacha hinaqa manam kanchu.
So they are the ones.	Chaymi paykunaqa kanku.
He didn’t talk much to anyone.	Payqa manan pimanpas anchatachu rimaq.
I know where he lives.	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta.
There was nothing you could do at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu karqan.
So they know what it is.	Chaymi paykunaqa yachanku ima kasqanta.
Snake, snake, snake.	Sonso, sonso, sonso.
But he doesn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwanchu.
You have to do that.	Qamqa chaytam ruwanayki.
No one is sure what comes next.	Manan pipas segurochu kashan imakuna qhepaman hamunanta.
I can’t say anything.	Manam ima niyta atiymanchu.
I don’t want to know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta munanichu.
It doesn’t seem to be good enough.	Mana allinchu kanman hina.
I know this is a good thing.	Yachanim kayqa allin kasqanmanta.
Third, each person created a background story.	Kimsa kaq, sapa runa huk qhipa willakuyta ruwarqa.
Another world, people.	Huk pacha, runakuna.
I didn't think it was any better.	Manam piensarqanichu aswan allin kananpaq.
I am an adult.	Kuraq runam kani.
However, this approach is not recommended.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
He is a new character.	Payqa huk musuq runam.
I don’t have that kind of time.	Manam chayna tiempoy kanchu.
I know there are many.	Yachanim achka kasqanmanta.
I want to be out there and play.	Munani hawapi kayta hinaspa pukllayta.
Say that again, please.	Chayta yapamanta niy, ama hina kaspa.
He had to do it, he said.	Payqa ruwanan karqan, nispas nisqa.
Maybe he was never really there.	Ichapas mana haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypichu karqa.
I don't want anyone from the city to come soon.	Manam munanichu llaqtamanta pipas chaylla hamunanta.
He had no idea how much time had passed.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu hayk’a tiempo pasasqanmantaqa.
I really want that for him.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani paypaq.
That will be a good thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi kanqa.
That is not possible to do.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atichwanchu.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa manan kayqa.
You have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanayki.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
That’s a good thing, the man said.	Chayqa allinmi, nispas nin chay runaqa.
That must be difficult.	Chayqa sasa kanan tiyan.
Again this is a good thing.	Yapamanta kayqa allinmi.
It wasn’t a bit good.	Manam huk chikan allinchu karqa.
There are two types here.	Kaypiqa iskay laya kan.
Some people were worried.	Wakin runakunam llakisqa karqaku.
I know that's something.	Chayqa imapas kasqanmantam yachani.
He knew he had no choice.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, chaytan yacharqan.
Therefore, it is.	Chayraykum.
One of them was a man.	Hukninmi karqa runa.
But this will never happen.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kayqa kanqachu.
Say that word.	Chay simita niy.
Half an hour.	Kuska hora.
It needs to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwanan.
However, it makes sense.	Ichaqa, yuyayniyuqmi.
I want to sing.	Takiyta munani.
I can't buy this.	Kaytaqa manam rantiyta atiymanchu.
Maybe, never.	Ichapas, mana haykapipas.
I said to myself.	nispaymi nirqani.
But then he did it.	Ichaqa chaymantam ruwarqa.
He still doesn't do that.	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Tell me one thing, do it.	Hukta willaway, ruway.
I can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam atiymanchu.
You’ll have him there.	Chaypim payta kanki.
But no one wanted to go.	Ichaqa manan pipas riyta munarqanchu.
And he was furious.	Hinaspa payqa sinchita phiñasqa kasharqan.
They seemed almost angry.	Paykunaqa yaqa phiñasqa hinam karqaku.
They are still there.	Paykunaqa hinallam kachkanku.
I don’t think so.	Manam yuyanichu.
Anyway, I couldn't.	Imayna kaptinpas manam atirqanichu.
All the time,' he said.	Tukuy tiempon’, nispa.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasharqan.
Once, twice, many times.	Huk kuti, iskay kuti, achka kuti.
The process was constant.	Chay ruwayqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
It looked familiar.	Chayqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
That, however, was later.	Chayqa ichaqa qhepamanmi karqan.
Know where it is.	Maypi kasqanmanta yachay.
You don’t want to know the whole story.	Manam tukuy willakuyta yachayta munankichu.
I’m proud of it actually.	Orgulloso kani chaymanta chiqaptaqa.
One of the girls was injured.	Huknin sipasmi k’irisqa kasharqan.
It was that simple.	Chay hina facilmi karqan.
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Eventually, he "learned to walk again."	Qhepamanmi "hukmanta puriyta yacharqan".
But it was never, ever true.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
Maybe there is nothing.	Ichapas mana imapas kanchu.
I hope you know that too.	Suyachkani qampas chayta yachasqaykita.
That sounds good, thank you.	Chayqa allinmi uyarikun, gracias.
That was a great man.	Chayqa hatun runam karqa.
He is always like that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna.
I didn’t see that coming.	Manam rikurqanichu chay hamunanta.
Now no one noticed.	Kunanqa manan pipas repararqanchu.
I could never find it.	Manam haykapipas tariyta atirqanichu.
This man offered me a job.	Kay runam llamkayta niwarqa.
You’ve done a lot.	Achkatam ruwarqanki.
What is this likely to be.	¿Imaynataq kayqa kanman.
And he died instantly.	Hinan chay rato wañupurqan.
That, the house.	Chay, wasi.
It’s that big of a deal.	Chayna hatunmi.
That is not a good thing to do.	Chayna ruwayqa manam allinchu.
Perhaps he was foolish.	Ichapas payqa mana yuyayniyuq karqa.
I know there is one.	Yachanim huknin kasqanmanta.
What was he supposed to do with it?.	¿Imatataq chaywan ruwanan karqa?.
I know it's hard.	Yachanim sasa kasqanmanta.
It would certainly be better not.	Chiqamanta aswan allin kanman mana.
I couldn’t see the road.	Manam ñanta rikuyta atirqanichu.
Otherwise he wouldn’t do that.	Mana chayqa manan chayta ruwanmanchu.
Here’s the man.	Kaypim runa.
There were older people there.	Chaypim kuraq runakuna karqa.
He wasn't ready to leave yet.	Payqa manaraqmi ripunanpaq listochu kasqa.
I've been doing this for twenty years.	Iskay chunka watañam kayta ruwachkani.
And then he knew what to do.	Hinaspa chaymanta yacharqa ima ruwananta.
It seemed that good.	Chayna allinmi rikchakurqa.
Yes, he has to do it.	Arí, paymi ruwanan.
I think that's pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi nispam piensani.
The good thing here.	Allin kaq kaypi.
But no one is there.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaypiqa.
I’m the only one here.	Ñuqallam kaypi kachkani.
If you want to go, go now.	Riyta munaspaqa kunan riy.
There were three.	Kimsa kasqa.
Maybe it would have been both.	Ichapas iskayninku kanman karqa.
No one really knows for that.	Chaypaqqa manam pipas chiqaptaqa yachanchu.
I haven’t seen anything like it.	Manam chaynataqa rikurqanichu.
This is actually not correct.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa manam allinchu.
I’m there again.	Hukmanta chaypi kachkani.
Of course, he couldn’t do any of that.	Chiqamanta, payqa manas chayta ima ruwayta atirqachu.
Better not, better not.	Aswan allinmi mana, aswan allinmi mana.
It had to be here somewhere.	Maypipas kaypi kanan karqa.
For the second time in a week.	Iskay kaq kutita huk semanapi.
He wanted to get out of here.	Payqa kaymanta lluqsiyta munarqan.
So he’s everywhere.	Chaymi payqa maypipas kachkan.
It was such a beautiful place.	Chhayna sumaqmi karqan.
Yes, he certainly did.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
The first is the person.	Ñawpaq kaqmi runa.
He’s been arrested.	Payqa hap’isqa kan.
It can be important.	Importante kanman.
But it doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
He’s a tough player.	Payqa sinchi pukllaqmi.
You don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachankichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
That was one thing.	Chayqa huk kaqmi karqa.
Seriously, that’s all.	Serio, chayllam.
And it’s huge.	Hinaspa hatunmi.
He looked at her sternly.	Payqa sinchita qhawarisqa.
A day doesn't matter.	Huk punchawqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
That’s why it’s so important.	Chayraykum ancha allinqa.
You can’t do that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I felt like a child.	Wawa hinam tarikurqani.
Everyone wants it.	Tukuy runa munasqanman hina.
Even if it’s me.	Ñuqa kaptinpas.
It was a very good thing to do.	Ancha allin ruwaymi karqa.
So two things.	Chaymi iskay imakuna.
This is bigger than me.	Kayqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi.
He is speaking well.	Payqa allintam rimachkan.
At least that would not be the case.	Aswanpas manan chay hinachu kanman.
This is a new year.	Kayqa musuq wata.
He certainly said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.
There will be many days.	Achka punchawmi kanqa.
Actually no, it still is.	Chiqaptaqa manam, hinallam kachkan.
But it just happened recently.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi pasarqa chayllaraq.
He was proud of what he did.	Payqa orgulloso karqan chay ruwasqanmanta.
It’s obviously the case.	Sut’inmi chay hina kasqanmanta.
As always, it was a bad one.	Sapa kuti hinam mana allin kaq karqa.
Not a new person.	Mana musuq runachu.
That’s neither here nor there.	Chayqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
He looked tired and exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa ima qhawarisqa.
I couldn’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
I want to walk in the world.	Kay pachapi puriyta munani.
In most cases, this is a good thing.	Yaqa llapanpim kayqa allin.
That means everything.	Chayqa tukuy imatam niyta munan.
More than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan achka.
I’m always right.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim.
I didn’t go with anyone.	Manam piwanpas rirqanichu.
But why are you doing that?	Ichaqa, ¿imanasqataq chaynata ruwachkanki?
I can’t wait, man.	Manam suyayta atinichu, runa.
I wonder if they mean anything to you.	Tapukunitaqmi, sichus qanpaq imapaqpas allinchu kanku.
He said he couldn't understand.	Paymi nirqa mana entiendeyta atisqanmanta.
I can't say it very well.	Manam ancha allintachu rimayta atiyman.
We have no idea whatsoever.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
I didn’t want to be one.	Manam huk kayta munarqanichu.
But today is the day.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi chay punchaw.
It never was, it never will be.	Manam haykapipas karqachu, manam haykapipas kanqachu.
We made him.	Paytaqa ruwarqayku.
I don’t know why that would happen.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kananta.
I still can't believe it.	Hinallam mana creeyta atinichu.
I know that’s the case.	Chaytaqa yachanin.
I don’t know if he’s a black man.	Mana yachanichu yana runa kasqanmanta.
So many out there don't.	Chaymi achka hawapi mana.
You’re a human being.	Qamqa runam kanki.
I want to go out more.	Astawan lluqsiyta munani.
He was busy.	Payqa ocupasqa kasqa.
He pulled out a big book.	Huk hatun librota hurqurqa.
If you really want it, let me know.	Sichus chiqaptapuni munanki chayqa, willaway.
We may have to wait a long time.	Yaqapaschá unayta suyasun.
I know too much.	Llumpay achkatam yachani.
I didn’t think about it.	Manam chaypiqa yuyaykurqanichu.
But you are a beautiful girl.	Ichaqa sumaq sipasmi kanki.
I don't want to see her again.	Manañam hukmanta rikuyta munanichu.
I didn’t know you were here, at home.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqaykita, wasipi.
But no, this was too funny.	Ichaqa manan, kayqa sinchi asikunapaq hinan karqan.
He seems very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam kachkan.
I’m kind of.	Ñuqaqa huk laya.
But let me know what you think!.	Ichaqa willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita!.
A really great house.	Chiqap hatun wasi.
I thought you wanted to know.	Yuyarqanim yachayta munasqaykita.
I’ve seen them before.	Chaykunataqa ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani.
I feel that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam sientekuni.
He thought it through.	Payqa allintan yuyaykurqan.
But there is a bigger role.	Ichaqa kanmi aswan hatun ruway.
You need to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwanayki.
Now he knew that wouldn't happen.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi chay mana pasananta.
I can't really comment right now.	Kunanqa manam chiqaptachu rimayta atiyman.
That’s something.	Chayqa imapas.
It’s very easy to do.	Ancha facilmi ruwayqa.
I didn’t know he was married.	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqanmanta.
Boy, are you good at it.	Wayna, allinchu kanki chaypi.
But he cannot speak properly.	Ichaqa manan allintachu rimayta atinman.
That’s all there is to it.	Chayllam chaypiqa kachkan.
Where did it come from?	¿Maymantataq hamurqa?
There is nothing here for you.	Kaypiqa manam imapas qampaq kanchu.
Maybe a few here and there.	Ichapas huk iskay kimsa kaypi chaypi.
I wasn’t anyone very happy.	Manam pipas ancha kusisqachu karqani.
I think this is a stupid thing to do.	Kayqa huk sonso ruway kasqanmantam piensani.
I knew it was there.	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqanmanta.
I knew he wouldn't come back.	Yacharqanim mana kutimunanta.
And this house.	Hinaspa kay wasi.
He says something.	Payqa imatapas nin.
For not doing it.	Mana ruwasqanmanta.
No one knows for sure.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
You want it very well.	Ancha allintam munanki.
Baby, it’s okay.	Wawa, allinmi.
I can't answer that.	Chaytaqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu.
Are you okay with it?	¿Allinchu kachkanki?
I've been there several times recently.	Chayllaraqmi achka kutita chayman rirqani.
So it’s a nasty thing.	Chaymi millay ima.
I am so happy to be here.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaypi kasqaymanta.
I know this won’t happen.	Yachanim kay mana pasananta.
Yeah, it’s not that good.	Arí, manam chayna allinchu.
For the time being.	Kunankamaqa.
I can’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atiymanchu.
You are now.	Kunanmi kanki.
I am deeply unhappy.	Sinchitan mana kusisqachu kashani.
He couldn’t sleep.	Payqa manan puñuyta atirqanchu.
But he does exist.	Ichaqa payqa kanmi.
Which is a very bad mistake.	Imataq ancha millay pantasqa.
Maybe he’s fired.	Ichapas qarqusqa.
He didn’t really know what was going to happen.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imachus pasananta.
I want to do something, be someone.	Imatapas ruwayta munani, pipas kayta.
That was great, it was the best thing to do.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqan, aswan allin ruwaymi karqan.
It’s a difficult task.	Sasa ruwaymi.
That may not be a good idea.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanqa.
Very good though.	Ancha allin ichaqa.
But that was the first one.	Ichaqa chaymi karqan ñawpaq kaq.
There is no humanity there.	Chaypiqa manam runa kay kanchu.
He’s a young man.	Payqa wayna.
I feel like that would be crazy.	Chayqa loco kanman hinam sientekuni.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Suyachkani hukmanta ruwayta seguro.
Thus, .	Kayna, .
There’s something there.	Chaypiqa imapas kanmi.
We have a good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
He wasn't sure why.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
It could be worse, you know.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman, yachanki.
I want to know how and why and when.	Munani yachayta imaynata hinaspa imarayku hinaspa haykapi.
What’s the weather like?	¿Imaynataq pacha?
I didn’t want to share anything about myself.	Manam imatapas ñuqamanta willayta munarqanichu.
Better and better.	Aswan allin hinaspa aswan allin.
More, more, and more.	Aswan, aswan, nispa.
This went on for an hour and a half.	Chaynatam pasarqa huk hora kuskan.
That looks pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I certainly knew where they were.	Cheqaqtapunin yacharqani maypi kasqankuta.
And what a boy he was.	Hinaspa ima wayna kasqa.
I was very curious.	Ñuqaqa anchatam yachayta munarqani.
I think he was at home.	Yuyaykuni wasinpi kasqanmanta.
Do it right this time.	Kay kutipi allinta ruway.
He sounds almost nervous.	Payqa yaqa mancharisqa hinam uyarikun.
It's going to be a great day, so it's going to be a great morning.	Chayqa hatun punchawmi kanqa, chaymi hatun paqarin kanqa.
For some reason everything happened.	Imaraykupas tukuy imapas pasasqanmanta.
Nothing to laugh about.	Mana imapas asikunapaq.
That’s a really big deal.	Chayqa chiqap hatunmi.
After that, he drove off somewhere.	Chay qhepamanmi maymanpas carropi ripurqan.
No one has ever done that before.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
But no one knew what to do.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
He’s exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kashan.
I am an out and proud person.	Ñuqaqa kani huk hawapi hinaspa orgulloso runa.
You need to do this immediately.	Chaytaqa chayllam ruwanayki.
Which means half.	Imataq kuskan niyta munan.
Here is the reason why.	Kaypim kachkan imarayku.
Probably the best this way.	Yaqapaschá kay hinaqa aswan allinqa.
But it will take some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempon kanqa.
I am sure it will be good.	Seguro kani allin kananmanta.
I’m sure he will.	Seguro kani chayta ruwananmanta.
I felt like a fool.	Sonso hinam tarikurqani.
If it’s a good one.	Allin kaptinqa.
So we did it.	Chaymi ruwarqayku.
I just couldn’t get over it.	Chaylla mana atipayta atirqanichu.
To do that, he said.	Chayta ruwananpaq.
We need to do better than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan allintam ruwananchik.
You didn’t know where you were.	Manam yacharqankichu maypi kasqaykita.
Who doesn’t?.	¿Pitaq mana?.
We played hard.	Sinchitan pukllaq kayku.
I know it's not much.	Yachanim mana ancha kasqanmanta.
There is nothing hidden.	Manam pakasqa kanchu.
And that’s what we are.	Hinaspa chayna kanchik.
So it is difficult to be sure of anything.	Chaymi imamantapas seguro kayqa sasa.
Where it will go and it does well.	Mayman rinqa hinaspa allinta ruwan.
It couldn’t be easier.	Mana aswan facilchu kanman.
You know they disagree.	Yachankim mana acuerdopi kasqankuta.
Sure, every month.	Seguro, sapa killa.
He had no idea what month it was.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu karqan ima killa kasqanmanta.
It may not be a good thing.	Manapaschá allinchu.
I meant to say.	Niyta munarqani.
Many people want to believe that it is.	Achka runakunam chayna kasqanmanta creeyta munanku.
That was about a year ago.	Chayqa yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I love that you can work.	Anchatan munani llank’ayta atisqaykita.
Tell him to leave.	Ripunanpaq niy.
I want to know it’s going to be okay.	Allinmi kananta yachayta munani.
He wanted everyone and everything to be happy.	Payqa munarqanmi llapa runa, tukuy ima kusisqa kananta.
So maybe.	Chaymi ichapas.
He couldn’t wait.	Manam suyayta atirqachu.
I didn’t see it coming.	Manam hamunanta rikurqanichu.
First time, last time.	Ñawpaq kuti, qhipa kuti.
There is something worse.	Aswan mana allinqa kanmi.
Obviously that had to be done later.	Sut’inmi chayta qhepaman ruwana karqan.
I had a lot of trouble with that.	Chaywanmi anchata sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
That was certainly something new.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mosoq karqan.
Eventually he thought.	Qhepamanmi yuyaykurqan.
I am a proud man.	Orgulloso runam kani.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan hinachu karqan.
He didn’t want to fix anything.	Payqa manañan imatapas allichayta munarqanchu.
That’s nice here.	Chayqa sumaqmi kaypi.
For the worse.	Aswan mana allinpaq.
I want to be someone.	Pipas kaytam munani.
Yes, it was there.	Arí, chaypim karqa.
That’s the way it is.	Chayna kay.
That’s the best thing!.	¡Chaymi aswan allinqa!.
He’s been living there for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi tiyashan.
And that would be three.	Hinaspa chayqa kinsa kanman.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
Could he have been able to.	¿Atinmanchu karqan.
I have a way to do this.	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa imaynatachus ruwanay tiyan.
The greater the uncertainty, the more severe the uncertainty.	Aswan hatun mana seguro kaptinqa, aswan sinchi mana seguro kayqa.
Such people are.	Chay hina runakunaqa.
He did this three times.	Chaytaqa kinsa kutitan ruwarqan.
He knew he didn't want to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana munasqanmanta.
If you did, you were fine.	Chayta ruwarqanki chayqa, allinmi karqanki.
said the man in shock.	nispas nin chay runaqa mancharisqa.
That should be easy.	Chayqa facilmi kanan.
What.	Ima.
However, that is not true.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
That doesn’t make it any better.	Chayqa manan aswan allintachu ruwan.
No one could do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
It was simple, but effective.	Chayqa facilmi karqa, ichaqa allinmi karqa.
But, it’s a house.	Ichaqa, huk wasi.
He couldn’t stand it.	Payqa manan chayta aguantayta atirqanchu.
He refused to talk.	Payqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
I will continue to do so.	Hinallam chayta ruwasaq.
But at least it was easy.	Ichaqa aswanpas facilmi karqan.
But they are not as good as humans.	Ichaqa manan runa hinachu allin kanku.
Something’s not quite right there.	Imapas mana allintachu chaypi.
I'd rather have something else.	Aswan allinmi kanman huk imatapas.
Either way, no one wants them.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam pipas chaykunataqa munanchu.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
So it never happens.	Chaymi mana haykapipas.
One knew what it was like.	Hukninmi yacharqan imayna kasqanmanta.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Ichaqa kunanmi yachanki mana chayna facilchu kasqanmanta.
You know exactly why.	Allintam yachanki imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But it won’t be the only thing.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kanqa.
But he didn’t notice.	Ichaqa manan repararqanchu.
Pretty busy though.	Allin ocupasqa ichaqa.
He couldn’t tell.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu.
He knows what he did wrong.	Payqa yachanmi mana allin ruwasqanmanta.
He hopes to find a better job.	Payqa suyanmi aswan allin llamkayta tariyta.
But then, that would be good.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chayqa allin kanman.
He can't say anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas niyta atinchu.
Too much of it is useless.	Llumpay chaymantaqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
He lives somewhere in the big city.	Maypipas hatun llaqtapi tiyan.
Everything else	Sapa imapas
They are there tonight.	Chaypin kunan tuta kashanku.
You know you shouldn’t be here.	Yachanki mana kaypi kanaykita.
This is no longer available.	Kayqa manañam kanchu.
And that’s probably for the best.	Hinaspa chayqa yaqapaschá allinpaq.
I think that was the worst moment.	Chayqa aswan mana allin kaq rato kasqanmantam piensani.
Now, if only.	Kunanqa, sichus chaylla.
I didn’t hear it anymore.	Manañam uyarirqanichu.
This should be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanan.
But everyone has it.	Ichaqa llapa runan kan.
Twenty years ago.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqta.
This is all crazy.	Kayqa tukuy loco kaymi.
After this, he probably wanted her.	Kay qhepamanmi yaqapaschá paytaqa munarqan.
He really did a great job.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin hatun llank’ayta ruwarqan.
Do what you can for him.	Paypaq atisqaykita ruway.
I felt the same way.	Ñuqapas chaynatam tarikurqani.
It was a great evening.	Hatun ch’isi karqan.
He couldn’t give up.	Payqa manam saqiyta atirqachu.
Easy is harder.	Facil nisqa aswan sasa.
Man, it was crazy.	Runa, loco kasqa.
I’m glad about it.	Kusikuni chaymanta.
I don't know how many, but a couple.	Mana yachanichu hayk'a kaqta, aswanpas huk casarasqa.
He had some great ideas.	Payqa wakin hatun yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
It’s a lot of people.	Ancha achka runakunam.
Not sure who said that first.	Mana segurochu pichus chayta ñawpaqta nirqa.
Maybe someone knows more.	Ichapas pipas astawan yachan.
Time to do the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwanapaq tiempo.
You know you’re beautiful.	Yachanki sumaq kasqaykita.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
I am yours, you are mine.	Ñuqaqa qampa kani, qamqa ñuqapa kanki.
This is useless, however.	Kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​ichaqa.
He said he was an avid swimmer.	Paymi nirqan anchata nadaq kasqanmanta.
Tell me what you can do.	Willaway ima ruway atisqaykita.
Again and again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta.
However, that will no longer work.	Ichaqa, chayqa manañan allinchu kanqa.
I am proud of that.	Chaymantam orgulloso kani.
Maybe a year.	Ichapas huk wata.
I’m really scared.	Cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa kashani.
He wanted to walk away.	Payqa puriyta munarqa.
Quick about that, right?	Utqaylla chaymanta, ¿riki?
I don't know what to do now.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
I had no idea what it was.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu karqani ima kasqanmantaqa.
I never expected it to happen.	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu chayna kananta.
I have my doubts about this.	Kaymantaqa iskayrayani.
We did very well.	Ancha allintam ruwarqayku.
A year passed by.	Huk wata pasarqa.
But it’s you.	Ichaqa qanmi.
Well.	Allin.
Looks like he did her and then he did it himself.	Rikchakun payqa payta ruwarqan chaymanta pay kikin ruwarqan.
But this wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu kanman.
What was wrong with it.	Imataq mana allin karqa.
A better me.	Huk aswan allin ñuqa.
It’s great right now.	Hatunmi kunan pacha.
This is not easy at all.	Kayqa manam facilchu ni imapipas.
The human being.	Runa kaq.
The worst part is.	Aswan mana allinqa.
He cannot find a job.	Payqa manam llamkayta tariyta atinchu.
I’m not going to be happy with that.	Manam chaywanqa kusisqachu kasaq.
I have been there many times.	Achka kutitam chayman rirqani.
It’s not unreasonable.	Manam mana yuyayniyuqchu.
It is the most important thing in the world.	Chayqa kay pachapi aswan importante kaqmi.
No one cares about that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas imananpaschu.
Yes, it’s a good one.	Arí, allinmi.
There isn’t much time.	Manam ancha tiempo kanchu.
This is a cruel thing to do.	Kayqa millay ruwaymi.
That’s part of that again.	Chayqa yapamanta chaymanta huknin.
This sounds simple, but it’s not.	Kayqa facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I'm still waiting, actually.	Hinallam suyachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I thought you were all too easy.	Llapallankum llumpay facil kasqaykita piensarqani.
I’m glad he wasn’t there.	Kusikuni mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
Again very happy with it.	Yapamanta ancha kusisqa chaywan.
I didn't think of that.	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu.
The performance is great.	Ruwayqa hatunmi.
Go, quickly.	Riy, utqaylla.
Here’s the thing.	Kaypiqa.
Less than nothing.	Mana imamanta aswan pisi.
I don’t believe that.	Manam chaytaqa creenichu.
And we did well.	Hinaspa allinta ruwarqayku.
It was not easy to talk to him.	Paywan rimayqa manam facilchu karqa.
He wanted her to be with us.	Munarqa paywan ñuqaykuwan kasqanta.
I mean it’s human.	Runa kasqanmantam niyta munani.
I really wish there was a way to do this.	Chiqaptam munani kayta ruwanapaq imayna kananta.
If that happened.	Sichus chayna pasarqa.
Not nearly as much as it should be.	Mana yaqa chay hinachu kanan hina.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan chayqa.
This is no longer so certain today.	Kayqa manañam kunan tiempopiqa chayna segurochu.
I wanted it so badly.	Sinchitan munarqani.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
Now he is afraid to do work.	Kunanqa manchakunmi llamkayta ruwayta.
He said it wouldn't work.	Payqa nirqam mana allinchu kananmanta.
She probably thought he was crazy.	Payqa yaqapaschá loco kananpaq yuyaykurqan.
I don’t know when, how or why.	Manam yachanichu haykapi, imayna hinaspa imarayku.
I did, but not quite.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manan allintachu.
It was difficult, but it was worth it.	Chayqa sasam karqa, ichaqa allinmi karqa.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
Do the latter first.	Ñawpaqtaqa qhipa kaqta ruway.
You have to keep doing it.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanayki.
He’s very good at it though.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypi ichaqa.
He certainly didn’t need to ask that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta tapuyta necesitarqanchu.
Worse than that, even more.	Aswan mana allin chaymanta, astawan.
I was ready to do something.	Imatapas ruwanaypaqmi listoña karqani.
Of course, he doesn’t have to.	Chiqamanta, mana chayta ruwananchu tiyan.
In fact, I've never seen anything like it.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas chaynataqa rikurqanichu.
He's happy, man.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan, runa.
It came out great.	Hatunmi lluqsirqa.
You said it right.	Allintam nirqanki.
I could never see that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa qawayta atirqanichu.
However, this was not a very successful process.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu karqan.
The process should be easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi kanan.
That will be the last one.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi kanqa.
Know who he is.	Pi kasqanmanta yachay.
He’s not real, he’s not there.	Payqa manan cheqaqchu, manan chaypichu.
He's going to be here for a long time.	Payqa unayñam kaypi kanqa.
It is usually very busy.	Yaqa llapanpim ancha ocupasqa kachkan.
I’m not good at being alone.	Manam allinchu kani sapallay kaypi.
Maybe that will make things better.	Ichapas chaywanqa aswan allin kanqa.
I had no idea how to tell the truth.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani imayna chiqap kaqta rimanaypaq.
Actually, maybe both.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas iskayninku.
Maybe the third.	Ichapas kimsa kaq.
Unfortunately it didn’t work out.	Llakikuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
I have heard him say that many times.	Sapa kutim uyarirqani chayna nisqanta.
I know how he feels.	Yachanim imayna sientekusqanmanta.
He was in the school.	Yachay wasipi kachkarqa.
I don't think that's going to happen today.	Manam kunan punchawchu chayna kananta yuyani.
One day the other day seemed so much.	Huk punchawmi huk punchawqa anchata rikchakurqa.
I mean are you really ready.	Niyta munani chiqaptachu listo kachkanki.
That’s really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
Nobody wants this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas munanchu.
But no, that wasn’t right.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I think that’s saying something.	Chayqa imatapas niyta munan, nispa yuyani.
I knew he would.	Yacharqanim chayna ruwananta.
I really couldn’t fix it.	Chiqaptaqa manam allichayta atirqanichu.
His success was immense.	Allin ruwasqanqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
The bad is good.	Mana allinqa allinmi.
Of course that meant he could.	Chiqamanta chaywanqa atisqanmanta niyta munarqa.
Everyone agreed that it was.	Lliwmi acuerdopi karqaku chayna kasqanmanta.
You never know.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
Can't think of much more.	Mana aswan achkata yuyaymanayta atinchu.
I still wonder if it really is.	Hinallam tapukuni sichus chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
The next step is easy.	Qatiqnin ruwayqa facilmi.
Or from here on out.	Utaq kaymanta.
He knew he couldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana atisqanmanta.
What is the secret?.	¿Imataq pakasqa?.
He wasn’t sure what his next move would be.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan qhepaman imachus ruwananmanta.
And that’s saying something.	Hinaspa chayqa imapas niyta munan.
Today is a beautiful day, isn't it?	Kunan punchawqa sumaq punchawmi, ¿aw?
He is a.	Payqa huk.
He realized what he had done.	Payqa repararqanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.
I know you want to help.	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita.
It was such a day.	Chay punchawqa chayna punchawmi karqa.
We are together every night.	Sapa tutam kuska kayku.
He sat there all day.	Tukuy punchaw chaypi tiyaq.
And he was angry.	Hinaspa payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
I’m not going to talk more about that.	Mana chaymanta aswan rimaq risaqchu.
It was a fairly regular thing to do.	Chayqa allin sapa kuti ruwaymi karqan.
Like everyone else.	Llapa runakuna hina.
I hope it doesn’t.	Suyachkani mana chayna kananpaq.
There were no two ways, he said.	Manam iskay ruwayqa karqachu, nispa.
That person was me.	Chay runaqa ñuqam karqani.
He’s a great player.	Payqa hatun pukllaqmi.
No one could say.	Manam pipas niyta atirqachu.
That was a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi karqan.
But he couldn’t do it in time.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu chay tiempopi ruwayta.
He thought it was.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay hina kananpaq.
That morning.	Chay paqarin.
Do it right anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas allinta ruway.
He's really enjoying it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi kusisqa kachkan.
I am afraid of not seeing and not understanding and not knowing.	Manchakuni mana qawayta hinaspa mana entiendeyta hinaspa mana yachayta.
You don’t want to get hurt.	Manan k’irisqa kayta munankichu.
I know it probably wasn't right.	Yachanim manapaschá allinchu karqa.
The first year of the	Ñawpaq kaq wata.
But of course that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
And, it could happen again this year.	Hinaspa, kay wata yapamanta kanman.
It shouldn’t be that difficult.	Manan chay hina sasachu kanan.
Nothing about humanity.	Mana imapas runa kaymanta.
You can do this several times, at least.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwawaq, aswanpas.
He wasn't alone, he said.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa, nispa.
He.	Pay.
But it is the truth.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi.
They are so amazing.	Paykunaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi kanku.
He had no reason to do so.	Payqa manan imaraykupas chayta ruwananpaqqa karqanchu.
He wanted to do this alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kayta ruwayta munarqan.
It was a very cold weather.	Sinchi chiri tiempon karqan.
Wrong again!	¡Hukmanta pantasqa!
I am a morning person.	Paqarin runam kani.
He wanted to drive.	Payqa carrota manejayta munarqa.
It should be about now.	Yaqa kunanmi kanan.
I am trying to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
I feel good about myself.	Allinmi sientekuni.
That’s why it’s there.	Chayraykum chaypi kachkan.
Here are some of mine.	Kaypi wakin ñuqapa kaqta.
No, he won’t do that.	Manan, manan chayta ruwanqachu.
But yeah, maybe.	Ichaqa arí, ichapas.
But you weren’t here all that time.	Ichaqa manan chay tukuy tiempopiqa kaypichu karqanki.
But I couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atirqanichu.
And that was three days ago.	Hinaspa chayqa kinsa p’unchay ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
That’s a fucking sick one.	Chayqa millay unqusqa.
Now he’s the one.	Kunanqa payqa.
It didn’t just happen.	Manam chayllachu pasarqa.
And if something goes wrong.	Hinaspa imapas mana allin kaptinqa.
She knew what he meant.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima niy munasqanmanta.
So there was one before that.	Chaymi chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa huknin karqa.
Late last year.	Qayna wata tukukuypi.
Tell a story.	Huk willakuyta willay.
There is no such thing at this time.	Kay tiempopiqa manan kanchu.
About once a month.	Killapi huk kuti hina.
That’s not the only thing.	Chayqa manan chayllachu.
But could it have been so easy.	Ichaqa, ¿chayna facilchu kanman karqa.
But this isn’t it.	Ichaqa kayqa manan.
Does this sound good?	¿Allinchu kayqa uyarikun?
That’s the biggest thing.	Chayqa aswan hatunmi.
He will make a fortune.	Payqa qhapaq kaytan ruwanqa.
So we’re really excited about that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa ancha kusisqa kachkaniku.
Explain why.	Willay imanasqa chayta.
I could go on and on.	Ñuqaqa hinallam riyta atiyman karqa.
I can never be innocent.	Manam haykapipas mana huchayoq kayta atiymanchu.
Yes, this is just for you.	Arí, kayqa qampaq hinallam.
If you think you can do it, you do it.	Sichus ruwayta atisqaykita yuyaykunki chayqa, ruwanki.
I really want to understand why.	Anchatam entiendeyta munani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He said he needed a lot of time.	Paymi nirqa achka tiempota necesitasqanmanta.
But there is no set time.	Ichaqa manan kanchu huk tiempo churasqa.
We are happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kachkaniku.
I didn’t want to talk to him.	Manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu.
I never noticed it.	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu.
But it will be fine with it.	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa chaywanqa.
Eventually you will be hungry.	Qhepamanmi yarqasqa kanki.
He played the game.	Payqa chay pukllayta pukllaq.
You think.	Yuyanki.
Something will happen, it will happen.	Imapas kanqa, kanqa.
You want to be rich.	Qhapaq kaytan munanki.
I know it wouldn't be easy.	Yachanim mana facilchu kanman.
It went a lot.	Anchatam rirqa.
I’m pretty sure I’m right.	Ñuqaqa allintam yachani.
Maybe all week.	Ichapas tukuy semanan.
I feel so lucky to be here.	Ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni kaypi kasqaymanta.
This is me, I am.	Kayqa ñuqam kani.
We really need to do good.	Chiqamanta allin kayta ruwananchik tiyan.
It’s all about you.	Tukuy ima qanmanta.
It wasn’t too difficult.	Manam ancha sasachu karqa.
It was a very good day.	Ancha allin punchawmi karqa.
I need more of that.	Aswan chayta necesitasaq.
Very, very much.	Ancha, ancha.
I had never heard of that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa uyarirqanichu.
It just seems so stupid.	Chayna sonso hinallam rikchakun.
Perhaps he was a man.	Ichapas payqa runa karqa.
So tell me this.	Chaymi kayta willaway.
There was a day for that.	Chaypaqqa huk punchawmi karqa.
But I won’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwasaqchu.
I don’t really know what he expects.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani ima suyasqanmanta.
Sick of it then.	Unqusqa chaymanta.
Better to do without it.	Aswan allinmi mana chaywan ruway.
He can be a very difficult person.	Payqa ancha sasa runam kanman.
It was supposed to be tonight.	Kunan tutam kanan karqa.
But it is not easy today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan facilchu.
I have seen this a lot.	Kaytaqa anchatam rikurqani.
He did it anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas chaytam ruwarqa.
I can't believe no one will help.	Manam creeyta atinichu mana pipas yanapananta.
But the night was more difficult.	Ichaqa tutan aswan sasa karqan.
He still wanted it so much, so much, despite everything.	Payqa hinallam anchata, llumpayta, tukuy ima kaptinpas munarqa.
However, this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, kayqa manam allinchu.
This is what he said.	Kaymi nirqa.
You know why you are like this.	Yachankim imanasqa kayna kasqaykita.
But it seems stupid.	Ichaqa sonso hinam.
He wanted to go for a walk.	Payqa puriq riyta munarqa.
Sure about it.	Seguro chaymanta.
I could be a teacher.	Yachachiq kayta atiyman.
If so, that is very sad.	Chayna kaptinqa, chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
Second, it's faster.	Iskay kaq, aswan utqayllam.
Too much to do.	Llumpay ruwanapaq.
It’s pretty good there.	Chaypiqa allin allinmi.
This was the case.	Kaymi karqan.
They were so great.	Paykunaqa ancha hatunmi karqaku.
I mean the right thing.	Allin kaqta niyta munani.
It’s better to be right.	Allin kananpaq aswan allin.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Mana imapas, mana imapas, mana imapas.
Never heard of him.	Mana hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.
That’s a good thing in the future.	Chayqa allinmi hamuq tiempopi.
I was pleasantly surprised.	Kusisqam admirakurqani.
You probably won’t do that.	Manachá chaytachu ruwanki.
But until now, this has never been the case.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
But he can do his best.	Ichaqa tukuy atisqanman hinan ruwanman.
It was the last one.	Chayqa karqan qhepa kaqmi.
And he had a couple of ideas for him.	Hinaspa huk iskay yuyayniyuq karqan paypaq.
But he wasn’t quite fast enough.	Ichaqa manan allintachu usqhaylla ruwaq.
That will do the trick for now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa allintam ruwanqa.
I just wasn’t ready.	Chayllaraqmi mana listochu karqani.
It didn’t exist before that.	Manaraq chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa karqachu.
Then he was sad.	Chaymanta llakisqa.
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan ima ruwananmanta.
Everyone is happy, very happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa, ancha kusisqa.
That practice is no longer acceptable.	Chay ruwayqa manañan allinchu.
He seemed surprised by it.	Chaywanqa admirasqa hinam karqa.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu imakuna pasananta.
I was there you know.	Chaypim karqani yachanki.
So far this sounds interesting.	Kunankamaqa kayqa sumaqmi uyarikun.
But it's nice anyway.	Ichaqa sumaqmi imayna kaptinpas.
He wanted to answer.	Payqa kutichiyta munarqan.
And this seems to be true.	Hinaspa kayqa chiqap hinam rikchakun.
I didn’t hear that.	Manam chaytaqa uyarirqanichu.
A man is a man this man.	Huk runa runa kay runa.
You have to do the right thing.	Chaypaqqa allintam ruwanayki.
He maintains his innocence.	Payqa mana huchayoq kasqanmantan nin.
They have been married for a long time.	Unayñan casarasqa kashanku.
For example? 	Kay hina?
No one knows what the future holds.	Manan pipas yachanchu qhepaman imachus pasananta.
He couldn't leave.	Payqa manam ripuyta atirqachu.
They have been here for a very long time.	Paykunaqa ancha unayñam kaypi kachkanku.
He recognized the opportunity.	Payqa repararqanmi chay oportunidadta.
I can’t not tell you.	Manam mana willayta atiymanchu.
Really good stuff, really, really good.	Chiqamanta allin kaq, chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin.
No, no it won’t be.	Manan, manan manan kanqachu.
I still want to.	Hinallam munani.
There is some truth there.	Chaypiqa kanmi wakin chiqap kaq.
He knew how to talk to her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paywan rimayta.
The result is the best way to do it, every time.	Chay ruwasqanqa aswan allin ruwaymi, sapa kuti.
Everyone was here.	Lliwmi kaypi karqaku.
I couldn’t tell you.	Manam niyta atirqanichu.
The first one is the best.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan allinqa.
I do my best, thank you.	Tukuy atisqayta ruwani, gracias.
I always imagined what it would be like.	Sapa kutim piensarqani imayna kananta.
You’ve been here before, haven’t you?	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypi karqanki, ¿aw?
I can’t do this.	Manam kayta ruwaymanchu.
Yes, many times.	Arí, achka kutitam.
There wasn’t much involved.	Manam anchatachu chaypiqa karqa.
You may not know exactly what it is like.	Ichapas mana allintachu yachanki imayna kasqanmanta.
That wasn’t that good.	Chayqa manan chhayna allinchu karqan.
He knew how to do it well.	Payqa allintam chayta ruwayta yacharqa.
I'm really afraid I don't.	Chiqaptam manchakuni mana.
We did it together.	Kuska ruwarqayku.
But it probably does.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwan.
This is what it looks like.	Kaymi rikchakun.
I hear things.	Imakunatapas uyarini.
He was a man of the house now.	Payqa kunan wasi runa kasqa.
In fact, he can probably play anything.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá imatapas pukllayta atinman.
That will do the trick.	Chayqa allintam ruwanqa.
He wasn’t alone here.	Kaypiqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
Now it’s not.	Kunanqa manan.
He has done similar things before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chayna ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
Did you really do your best, boy?	¿Cheqaqtachu tukuy atisqaykita ruwarqanki, wayna?
But it’s not like it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu.
However, this approach is not very effective.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa, tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
I was happy that he was so happy about it.	Kusisqam karqani chaymanta ancha kusisqa kasqanmanta.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu.
I don’t want to do this walk.	Manam kay puriyta ruwayta munanichu.
Everyone knows about it.	Tukuy chaymanta yachanku.
But he is right.	Ichaqa allintam rimachkan.
It’s about everything.	Tukuy imamanta riman.
All or nothing, he said.	Tukuy utaq mana imapas, nispas nisqa.
He knows you are not what he wants you to be.	Payqa yachanmi mana munasqanman hinachu kasqaykita.
I'm not sure anyone else really can.	Manam segurochu kani huk runa chiqaptapuni atisqanmanta.
No seriously, he really couldn't.	Mana serio, chiqaptaqa manam atirqachu.
This would be wonderful for him.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi paypaq kanman.
They are very beautiful.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
It makes it more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi chayta ruwan.
Actually, it’s pretty simple.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha facilmi.
That’s a .	Chayqa huk .
There it is again, yes.	Chaypin yapamanta kashan, arí.
He is mostly alone.	Yaqa llapanpim sapallan kachkan.
I can't wait to give it a go.	Manam suyayta atinichu huk kutita ruwayta.
It seems to be desirable.	Munaymanmi rikchakun.
He was angry, angry for a while now.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa, kunan huk rato phiñasqa kasqa.
Now it’s everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas.
Less, if anything.	Aswan pisi, sichus imapas.
I felt the same way you do.	Ñuqapas qampa hinam tarikurqani.
He’s lucky though.	Payqa suerteyoqmi ichaqa.
That he wanted her.	Payta munasqanmanta.
You said you were safe.	Seguro kasqaykita nirqanki.
That’s the biggest thing right now.	Chayqa kunan aswan hatun kaqmi.
I want to handle this as a good person.	Kaytaqa allin runa hinam allichayta munani.
I can do this job for you.	Kay llamkayta qampaq ruwayta atiyman.
This doesn't have to be a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu kanan.
We cannot answer that.	Chaytaqa manam kutichiyta atichwanchu.
He tried to make things better.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi imapas allin kananpaq.
Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allin.
Everything is difficult to do.	Tukuy ima ruwayqa sasam.
I can't get over this.	Kaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu.
He prefers to sleep there in the winter.	Payqa aswan allinmi chiri tiempopi chaypi puñuyta.
They seem to be afraid of him.	Paytaqa mancharisqa hinam kanku.
He couldn't sit here all day.	Payqa manam tukuy punchawchu kaypi tiyayta atirqachu.
Still, he knows it.	Chayna kaptinpas payqa yachanmi.
If anyone can help it would be great.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
What did you say, right?	¿Imatataq nirqanki?
I am the only one who can comment on this.	Ñuqallam kaymanta rimayta atin.
He did well for a while.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa huk tiempo.
It came out immediately.	Chayllam lluqsirqa.
I do this and that every day.	Sapa punchawmi kayta chayta ruwani.
He cannot eat properly.	Payqa manam allintachu mikuyta atin.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta.
And he learned to play.	Hinaspa pukllayta yacharqa.
John, thank you.	Juan, gracias.
The truth is hard.	Cheqaq kaqmi ichaqa sinchi sasa.
He sensed something was wrong.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas mana allin kashasqanmanta.
Then it happened again.	Chaymantam yapamanta pasarqa.
There is actually a third.	Chiqaptaqa kanmi kimsa kaq.
But maybe it was.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna karqa.
I wanted to be sure.	Seguro kaytam munarqani.
It’s not that simple .	Manan chay hina facilchu .
I know it is true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta.
He was a sick child.	Unqusqa wawa kasqa.
Now, it’s very important.	Kunanqa, ancha importante.
Now everyone agreed.	Kunanqa llapallankum acuerdopi karqaku.
You can’t go on like this.	Manan kay hinaqa puriyta atiwaqchu.
But it can’t be that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanman.
I’m not the only one.	Mana ñuqallachu kani.
Please don’t him please don’t him.	Ama hina kaspa ama payta ama hina kaspa ama paytaqa.
They want money.	Paykunaqa qullqita munanku.
I would love to live here.	Kaypi tiyayta anchata munani.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Payqa rantiyta munani nispas nisqa.
But it’s you.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki.
Day two was no better.	Iskay punchawqa manam aswan allinchu karqa.
However, you are doing really well.	Ichaqa, chiqap allintam ruwachkanki.
Maybe there’s something you want from me.	Ichapas ñuqamanta imapas munasqayki kachkan.
It really doesn't matter though.	Chiqaptaqa manam imananpaschu ichaqa.
Two people are injured.	Iskay runakunam k’irisqa kachkanku.
It wasn’t really a house.	Manam chiqaptachu wasi karqa.
The process was a great success.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Would you like to go to the city?	¿Munawaqchu llaqtaman riyta?
I have no idea what the problem is here.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima sasachakuy kaypi kasqanmanta.
I heard that.	Chayta uyarirqani.
He wished he hadn't.	Payqa munarqanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
That is not a good thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa manam allinchu.
That’s the one there.	Chay chaypi kaq.
I still couldn’t believe it was happening.	Manaraqmi creeyta atirqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I have been in this predicament for a long time.	Unayñan chay sasachakuypi kashani.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I’m the only one here.	Kaypiqa ñuqallam kachkani.
But he never really did.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I'm sure it doesn't.	Seguro kani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I can’t wait for tonight.	Mana kunan tuta suyayta atinichu.
He was worried about what would happen next.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan imachus qhepaman pasananta.
More impressed.	Aswan admirasqa.
He wasn’t supposed to be happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanan karqa.
Good learning!	¡Allin yachay!
But it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi.
Which is okay with me.	Imataq ñuqawanqa allin kachkan.
I don’t like it here anymore.	Kaypiqa manañam gustanchu.
It was a good thing to do.	Allin ruwaymi karqan.
But I’m serious.	Ichaqa serio kani.
This is ideal for building.	Kayqa allinmi wasi ruwanapaq.
This was something new.	Kayqa musuq kaqmi karqan.
He knows something.	Payqa imatapas yachanmi.
I’ve done all of these things.	Tukuy chaykunataqa ruwarqani.
You are here with us.	Qamqa kaypim kanki ñuqaykuwan.
I’m not that good.	Manam chayna allinchu kani.
He couldn't hear what it was.	Manam uyariyta atirqachu ima kasqanmanta.
This has been pretty interesting so far.	Kayqa kunankamaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I will do that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwasaq.
But it doesn’t really do anything.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas ruwan.
And then the week.	Hinaspa chaymanta semana.
I don’t know about that.	Manam yachanichu chaymantaqa.
But there it was again.	Ichaqa chaypim yapamanta karqa.
He was always busy.	Payqa sapa kutim ocupasqa karqa.
You have to do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwanayki.
Again, and again, and again.	Yapamanta, yapamanta, yapamanta.
Can't understand what's wrong.	Mana entiendeyta atinchu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
Yes, it’s not a good thing.	Arí, mana allinchu.
The first, however, is uncertain.	Ñawpaq kaqmi ichaqa mana segurochu.
And he stayed.	Hinaspa qhepakurqan.
I wonder if he was ever here.	Tapukuni sichus hayk'aqllapas kaypi karqanchu.
I’ve done it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqani.
Ask someone to do something.	Pitapas imatapas ruwananpaq niy.
We cannot talk about this.	Kaymantaqa manam rimayta atichwanchu.
But it is better to act quickly.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi usqhaylla ruway.
He really had to go.	Chiqaptam rinan karqa.
No, he wasn’t feeling well.	Manan, payqa manan allinchu kasharqan.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa manan kaychu.
I wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqani.
I didn’t see much of it.	Manam anchatachu rikurqani.
I knew something was wrong.	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
It was foolishness.	Mana yuyayniyuq kaymi karqa.
Probably not so well.	Yaqapaschá mana chayna allintachu.
I am trying as the next.	Qatiqnin hinam kallpanchakuchkani.
There was time for that later.	Chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo karqan.
It didn’t go well there.	Chaypin mana allintachu rirqan.
Outside of him.	Paymanta hawapi.
She was beautiful now.	Payqa kunanqa sumaqmi kasqa.
There was always something.	Imapas sapa kutim karqa.
But, again, maybe not.	Ichaqa, yapamanta, ichapas mana.
It’s not like he means anything by that.	Manan chaywanqa imatapas niyta munanmanchu hinachu.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Kunanqa manañam pukllayta munanchu ni imapipas.
If not, who knows.	Mana chayqa, pitaq yachan.
Who is doing the talking?	¿Pitaq rimayta ruwachkan?
It’s a time of intense action.	Sinchi ruway pacha.
He said goodnight.	Allin tuta nispas nisqa.
I couldn’t believe it was real.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqap kasqanmanta.
You know, like me.	Yachanki, ñuqa hina.
Where have you been? 	¿Maypitaq karqanki?
That’s been around for a long time.	Chayqa unayñan kashan.
I’m feeling hurt.	K’irisqa tarikuni.
I know what he's going to do.	Yachanim ima ruwananta.
Tell me right away.	Chaylla willaway.
I need to get some sleep.	Puñuyta necesitasaq.
Then again, maybe it should have been hard.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas sasa kanan karqa.
The action is quick.	Ruwayqa utqayllam.
He didn’t say much.	Payqa manan anchatachu rimarqan.
Do something else.	Hukta ruway.
There it is now.	Chaypim kunan kachkan.
We did it every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaytaqa ruwaq kayku.
It’s been a long time.	Unayñam.
Please tell me now.	Ama hina kaspa kunan willaway.
Everyone is a good guy.	Lliwmi allin ruwaq kanku.
He said that was a good thing.	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam nirqa.
And that’s unfortunate.	Hinaspa chayqa llakikuypaqmi.
I just didn’t want to talk to him anymore.	Chaylla manaña paywan rimayta munarqanichu.
I would have loved more coffee.	Aswan kukata anchata munani karqan.
They want to talk to you.	Paykunaqa qanwan rimayta munanku.
He is the best in this city.	Paymi kay llaqtapi aswan allinqa.
On the contrary, this is wrong.	Aswanpas kayqa manan allinchu.
It was great, as always.	Ancha allinmi karqa, sapa kuti hina.
I don’t feel good anymore.	Manañam allinchu sientekuni.
He quit, he knew it.	Payqa saqirqa, chaytam yacharqa.
I don’t know how else to describe it.	Manam yachanichu imaynata hukmanta willakuyta.
I never thought anything of it.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa imatapas piensarqanichu.
He looked at her carefully, surprised.	Payqa allinta qhawarisqa, admirasqa.
I want to tell you more about that.	Chaymanta astawan willayta munani.
I don’t know how that’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu imayna chayna kananta.
You, young man.	Qam, wayna.
He left that night.	Chay tutan ripurqan.
He did it several times.	Achka kutitam chayta ruwarqa.
We need to do better than that.	Aswan allintam chaymantaqa ruwananchik.
They are all here!	¡Llapallankum kaypi kachkanku!
I don't really think so.	Manam chiqaptachu chaynataqa piensani.
Is there anyone?	¿Pipas kanchu?
You did it yourself.	Chaytaqa qanmi ruwarqanki.
You are too good a person not to do it.	Qamqa ancha allin runam kanki mana ruwanaykipaq.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
Boy, it would be nice if there was, though.	Wayna, sumaqmi kanman sichus kanman chayqa, ichaqa.
It’s better to say nothing.	Aswan allinmi mana imatapas niy.
Instead, he tried not to.	Aswanpas kallpachakurqanmi mana chayta ruwananpaq.
He knew he didn't have to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
He didn’t do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu.
That wouldn’t work at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu kanman.
No, it doesn’t make sense.	Manan, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I’m sorry this hurt.	Pampachaykuway kay k’irisqa kasqanmanta.
I’m not the only one who thinks so.	Manam ñuqallachu chaytaqa piensani.
But the big thing is this.	Ichaqa hatun kaqmi kay.
I wasn’t really excited.	Manam chiqaptachu kusisqa karqani.
They are quick and really easy.	Paykunaqa utqaylla hinaspa chiqap facilmi.
I am the best.	Ñuqam aswan allinqa kani.
I will never be this happy.	Manam haykapipas kay hina kusisqachu kasaq.
He didn’t really know how to do it.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imaynatachus ruwananta.
But it all depends on why.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas imarayku kasqanmantam kanqa.
It’s still going on.	Hinallam kachkan.
No one can do it for you.	Manan pipas qanpaq ruwayta atinmanchu.
I don’t mean that.	Manam chaytachu niyta munani.
I want to know what happens next.	Chay qhepaman imachus pasananta yachayta munani.
That was really about it.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chaymanta karqan.
I mean something, man.	Imatapas niyta munani, runa.
Someone out there is worried.	Chay hawapi pipas llakisqa kachkan.
He won’t be there.	Payqa manan kanqachu.
The process may not be very appealing.	Chay ruwayqa manapaschá anchatachu gustan.
Scholars often disagree.	Yaqa llapanpim yachaysapa runakunaqa mana acuerdopichu kanku.
At home, at school.	Wasipi, yachay wasipi.
I don’t want to be there.	Manam chaypi kayta munanichu.
We did it successfully.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqayku.
That would be very bad.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi kanman.
Not anyone.	Manan pipas.
Before.	Ñawpaq.
Otherwise it does nothing.	Mana chayqa manan imatapas ruwanchu.
And then he.	Hinaspa chaymanta pay.
I wish it were the case.	Munaymanmi chayna kananpaq.
Him in the car.	Payta carropi.
Why do you think this happened?	¿Imanasqataq chayna pasasqanmanta yuyanki?
Many people were very happy.	Achka runakunam ancha kusisqa karqaku.
Food time.	Mikhuy pacha.
It looked sad.	Llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
I would be happy about anything.	Imamantapas kusisqa kayman.
People are stupid.	Runakunaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I learned a lot too.	Ñuqapas achkatam yacharqani.
You too .	Qampas .
Not quite yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu.
No one could hear him.	Manam pipas uyariyta atirqachu.
I really had no idea what might happen.	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani imachus kanman chayta.
I want it now.	Kunanmi munani.
Please tell me what to do.	Ama hina kaspa, imata ruwanaypaq willaway.
He’s quick.	Payqa usqhayllan.
I'm fine with that.	Allinmi kachkani chaywanqa.
It makes no sense, he says.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu, nispas nin.
And, yes, it is a real day.	Hinaspa, arí, chiqap punchawmi.
Do you have that good sense.	¿Chay allin yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
So, you can’t win!	Chaymi, ¡manan atiwaqchu atipayta!
Didn't really quit.	Mana chiqaptachu saqirqa.
I knew it was a problem.	Yacharqanim sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I know that's wrong.	Yachanim chay mana allin kasqanmanta.
Who is to blame?	¿Pitaq huchayoq kanman?
It will never be so bad.	Manam haykapipas chayna mana allinqa kanqachu.
He shouldn’t be doing it.	Manam ruwananchu.
Instead, he said nothing.	Aswanpas manan imatapas nirqanchu.
We’ve done that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqayku.
He can’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atinmanchu.
In fact, it really can be that bad.	Chiqaptaqa, chiqaptam chayna mana allin kanman.
Maybe that’s what this is about.	Ichapas chaymanta kayqa rimachkan.
This if too often a problem.	Kay sichus ancha sapa kuti huk sasachakuy.
If you’re not happy, do something about it.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, imatapas ruway.
So this is the way it is.	Chaymi kay hinaqa.
Scientists are not sure why.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa manam allintachu yachanku imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I think that is very sad.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi piensani.
Beautiful young man.	Sumaq wayna.
I hope he comes back.	Pay kutimunanta suyachkani.
But it was much, much bigger.	Ichaqa aswan, aswan hatunmi karqan.
I thought it might be yours.	Yuyarqanim qampa kanman nispa.
Can’t wait to hear from you!.	¡Mana suyayta atiymanchu qammanta uyariyta!.
I’ll be there and.	Ñuqaqa chaypi kasaq hinaspa.
I’m tired of doing things like this.	Sayk’usqañan kani kay hinata ruwaspa.
He did not say why.	Payqa manan nirqanchu imarayku chayta.
A day, a few hours.	Huk punchaw, iskay kimsa hora.
The process was amazing.	Chay ruwayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Really, really badly.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana allinta.
Now he could do nothing.	Kunanqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
There will be no second chances.	Manam iskay kaq chansa kanqachu.
Maybe they want to think about it.	Ichapas chaypi yuyaymanayta munanku.
In fact, he always was.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa sapa kutim karqa.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Allintam yacharqani ima munasqanmanta.
He has nothing.	Payqa manan imapas kanchu.
In fact, there is.	Chiqaptaqa kanmi.
She looked at him now.	Payqa kunanmi payta qhawarisqa.
I didn’t want to get caught.	Manam munarqanichu hapisqa kayta.
I’ve been here all this time.	Tukuy kay pacha kaypi karqani.
Yes this world.	Arí kay pacha.
Yes, there is.	Arí, kanmi.
The reality was very good.	Chiqap kaqmi ancha allin karqa.
So twice as much.	Chaymi iskay kutita.
He doesn’t know what’s going on.	Payqa manan yachanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
He didn’t know where to go.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu mayman riyta.
Only you can do this for me.	Qamllam kaytaqa ñuqapaq ruwawaq.
He couldn't fix it.	Payqa manam chaymanta allichayta atirqachu.
I haven’t seen it yet.	Manaraqmi rikunichu.
Having a cup of coffee with you would be nice.	Qamwan kuska huk kukata ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
I heard it was great.	Uyarirqanim ancha allin kasqanmanta.
I'm fine with being.	Allinmi kachkani kasqaymanta.
Really nice stuff.	Chiqamanta sumaq imakuna.
That would be a big deal.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi kanman.
He knew what they were like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kasqankuta.
Please go, now.	Ama hina kaspa riy, kunan.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kan.
There are a lot of people.	Achka runakunam kan.
Do it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruway.
But now it was something else.	Ichaqa kunanqa huk kaqmi karqa.
We are immigrants.	Huk llaqtamanta hamuq runakunam kanchik.
This means now.	Kayqa kunan niyta munan.
It’s a lot of action.	Ancha ruwaymi.
And say that’s it.	Hinaspa chayta niy.
He couldn’t do it happily.	Payqa manan kusisqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
A few days.	Iskay kimsa punchaw.
That’s what you do best.	Chaytan aswan allinta ruwanki.
Maybe there’s one.	Ichapas kan huk.
We can’t talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta atichwanchu.
And this is a good thing.	Hinaspa kayqa allinmi.
He was just there.	Payqa chayllaraqmi chaypi kasqa.
I mean, sure he was.	Niyta munani, seguro payqa karqan.
These are the most absurd.	Kaykunaqa aswan mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Some people love to meditate.	Wakin runakunaqa anchatam munanku yuyaymanayta.
A month later, he reconsidered.	Huk killa qhepamanmi hukmanta yuyaykurqan.
I don’t want to go there.	Manam chayman riyta munanichu.
What would happen if.	Imataq kanman sichus.
I mean this is what I mean.	Kayta niyta munani.
That would be crazy.	Chayqa loco kaymi kanman.
He was pretty sure he wasn't.	Payqa allintam seguro karqa mana kasqanmanta.
But I don’t see that happening.	Ichaqa manan rikunichu chay pasananta.
Please do it.	Ama hina kaspa ruway.
He’s better at it than I am.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan allinmi chaypiqa.
He couldn’t stop.	Mana saqiyta atirqachu.
Maybe he seemed a little nervous.	Ichapas huk rato mancharisqa hina karqa.
He couldn't understand what it was like.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imayna kasqanmanta.
The people were huge.	Chay runakunaqa hatun hatunmi karqaku.
If there isn't one thing, it's one thing.	Mana huk kaq kaptinqa huk kaqmi.
I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.
Which isn’t bad, but it’s not good.	Imataq mana mana allinchu, ichaqa mana allinchu.
I'm really tired today.	Chiqaptam kunan punchawqa sayk'usqa kachkani.
He is a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runam.
He can't speak.	Mana rimayta atinchu.
That's a crazy thing.	Chayqa huk loco hinam.
I mean, you do.	Niyta munani, qamqa ruwanki.
I'm actually looking forward to this.	Chiqaptaqa kaytam suyachkani.
He quickly left the city.	Payqa usqhayllan llaqtamanta ripurqan.
I’m a young man	Ñuqaqa wayna kani
A good man in the world.	Allin runa kay pachapi.
They’re great at that.	Paykunaqa chaypiqa hatunmi kanku.
But that is the ultimate goal.	Ichaqa chaymi qhepa kaq ruwayqa.
That's probably pretty quick.	Chayqa yaqapaschá allin utqaylla.
But he couldn’t, he knew.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu, chaytan yacharqan.
I really like it a lot.	Anchatam anchata gustan.
He really needs quality time.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin necesitan allin tiempota.
I was the person who made it happen.	Ñuqam chayna kananpaq ruwaq runa karqani.
Neither do I, man.	Ñuqapas nitaq, runa.
I wasn’t ready to go.	Manam rinaypaq listochu karqani.
It means a lot.	Anchatam niyta munan.
Maybe this was it.	Ichapas kayqa karqa.
That’s what we did.	Chayta ruwarqayku.
Can’t stand being late.	Mana tarde kayta aguantayta atinchu.
And now it’s.	Hinaspa kunanqa.
He wanted to know why.	Payqa yachayta munarqa imanasqa chayta.
I never heard of him.	Manam haykapipas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
Now everyone knows.	Kunanqa llapallankum yachanku.
We’ve been together this whole time.	Kay tukuy pacha kuska kanchik.
It’s really, really great.	Chiqap, chiqap hatunmi.
To make it bigger.	Aswan hatun kananpaq.
I have heard these things.	Chaykunataqa uyarirqanim.
It’s beautiful here.	Kaypiqa sumaqmi.
They were good people.	Paykunaqa allin runakunam karqaku.
He certainly didn’t do that.	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin mana ruwarqanchu.
I was good at it.	Allinmi karqani chaypi.
Everyone speaks.	Llapallankum riman.
He’s done it before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I was truly a happy child.	Cheqaqtapunin kusisqa wawa karqani.
I want all of that.	Tukuy chaytam munani.
It’s not a big deal.	Manam hatun ruwaychu.
But he didn’t do it very often.	Ichaqa manan ancha sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq.
So it was very nice.	Chaymi ancha sumaq karqa.
You’ve been there a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kashanki.
No, not exactly.	Manan, manan allintachu.
Low.	Pisi.
I am still waiting for an answer.	Kunankamapas kutichiyta suyachkani.
It all seems so long ago.	Tukuy imapas ancha unayñam rikchakun.
He seemed a little annoyed.	Payqa huk chhikanta phiñasqa hinan kasqa.
He was never around long enough.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas unaytachu chaypi kasharqan.
It’s like everything else.	Tukuy ima hinam.
Now he needs money.	Kunanqa qolqetan necesitan.
That same weekend.	Chay kikin semana tukukuypi.
And that’s why he was so good.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa chay hina allin karqan.
There are a lot of awesome people.	Achka manchay runakunam kachkan.
That is a reasonable statement.	Chayna nisqanqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
This process is surprisingly difficult.	Kay ruwayqa admirakuypaqmi sasa.
Perhaps he did.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
He knew what was involved.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
Would you like to see a movie?	¿Munawaqchu huk peliculata qawayta?
You are a human being.	Qamqa runa runam kanki.
The university teacher is sick.	Hatun yachay wasipi yachachiqmi unqusqa kachkan.
Anyone can be great.	Pipas hatunmi kanman.
The man could not repeat a simple sentence.	Chay runaqa manan huk facil rimayta yapamanta rimayta atirqanchu.
I could never do it again.	Manañam haykapipas ruwayta atirqanichu.
Being a good speaker.	Allin rimaq kay.
Said he was so quick and smart.	Nisqa chayna utqaylla hinaspa yachaysapa kasqanmanta.
This was a lonely one.	Kayqa sapallanmi karqa.
What would you do with it.	Imatataq ruwawaq.
But it’s not true, anymore.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu, manañan.
I always wanted to do him.	Paytaqa sapa kutilla ruwayta munarqani.
I didn’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwarqanichu.
If only he could see.	Sichus rikuyta atinman karqan chayqa.
No one wanted to do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
That’s what I had to do.	Chaynatam ruwanay karqa.
They are all sick.	Llapallankum unqusqa kachkanku.
I talked to him all the time.	Tukuy tiempon paywan rimaq kani.
I had to be something more.	Aswan imapas kanay karqa.
There, now you know.	Chaypi, kunan yachanki.
That is what I said at the time.	Chaynatam chay tiempopi nirqani.
Unfortunately he was badly injured.	Llakikuypaqmi payqa sinchita k’irisqa karqan.
But this was not the case.	Ichaqa manan kaychu karqan.
How it’s caught.	Imayna hap’isqa.
He said he didn’t.	Nirqanmi mana ruwarqanchu nispa.
You’re a great guy.	Qamqa hatun runam kanki.
It was bigger than me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kanan karqan.
He was the one who had to do it.	Paymi chayta ruwanan karqan.
It sounds easy.	Facilmi uyarikun.
But it was too soon for that.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa usqhayllan karqan.
It will be better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi kanqa.
Again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta.
There’s something here.	Kaypiqa imapas kachkan.
Actually, really good.	Chiqaptaqa, chiqap allin.
There was one thing, there was something better.	Huk kaqmi karqa, aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
He said it was yours.	Paymi nirqa qampa kasqanmanta.
I always tried to make it happen.	Sapa kutim kallpanchakurqani chayna kananpaq.
And do it right away.	Hinaspa chaylla ruway.
I wanted something more.	Astawan imatapas munarqani.
I hope nothing goes wrong.	Suyachkani mana imapas mana allin kananpaq.
This one went much better.	Kayqa aswan allintam rirqa.
That’s a tough thing.	Chayqa sinchi imapas.
He never does that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
It was a failure.	Huk mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
I hope this doesn’t work out.	Suyachkani kayqa mana allintachu ruwananta.
That will take some time.	Chaypaqqa huk tiempon kanqa.
No, he doesn't.	Manan payqa manan.
He would have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
The result was immediate.	Chay ruwasqanqa chayllam karqa.
I actually like it.	Chiqaptaqa gustanmi.
Two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaqta.
Same weekend at home.	Kikin kaq semana tukuyta wasipi.
If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.	Sichus ancha allin kanman chayqa, yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
I didn’t notice it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam repararqanichu.
There was a chance.	Chaypin huk chansa karqan.
Same every time.	Kikin sapa kuti.
Now that’s not a bad thing.	Kunanqa chayqa manan mana allinchu.
I was so crazy.	Anchatam loco karqani.
I’m nowhere to be found.	Mana maypipas kani.
I’m sorry, but that’s all.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa chayllam.
Then he’s talking about it.	Chaymantam rimachkan.
He couldn't play outside anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam hawapi pukllayta atirqachu.
I still don't understand what happened.	Kunankamapas manam entiendenichu imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I'm pretty sure it was him.	Yaqa segurom kani pay kasqanmanta.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Ichaqa manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
However, that's really not much of it.	Ichaqa, chayqa chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu chaymanta.
He does a great job at this.	Payqa kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwan.
Like many people.	Achka runakuna hina.
It was never meant to be.	Manam haykapipas chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
He was much bigger now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan hatunmi kasqa.
Like, really early.	Imayna, chiqap temprano.
I didn’t know where he was.	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
However, this may be the worst possible outcome.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chay ruwayqa aswan mana allin kanman.
I never even find him.	Manam haykapipas tarinichu nitaq paytaqa.
Go now, please.	Kunan riy, ama hina kaspa.
I've been doing this for a long time.	Unayñam kayta ruwachkani.
He agreed to be there.	Chaypi kananpaqmi arí nisqa.
This is included here.	Kayqa kaypi churasqa kachkan.
After that, I didn’t.	Chay qhepamanmi mana.
The man was angry.	Chay runaqa phiñasqa kasqa.
By doing the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwaspa.
He doesn’t want to go home!.	¡Manan wasinman riyta munanchu!.
He doesn't like anyone.	Payqa manam pitapas gustanchu.
He said you were in trouble.	Payqa nirqanmi sasachakuypi kasqaykita.
Other than that, nothing really.	Huk chaymanta, mana imapas chiqap.
Who was it.	Pitaq karqan.
Tell me what he said.	Willaway ima nisqanmanta.
And they’re stupid.	Hinaspa sonso kanku.
Obviously, he knew where they were.	Sut’inmi, payqa yacharqanmi maypi kasqankuta.
It’s nothing like it’s on the surface.	Manam imapas hawapi hinachu.
Not difficult again.	Mana sasachu yapamanta.
It was a good year.	Allinmi wata karqa.
I am really excited about this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani.
I think that is wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t stand it.	Manam aguantayta atinichu.
He’s a player.	Payqa pukllaqmi.
I know, but .	Yachanim, ichaqa .
I’m sorry you weren’t there.	Pampachaykuway mana chaypichu kasqaykita.
You know for sure.	Cheqaqtapunin yachanki.
Everything would be fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
Less than that.	Aswan pisi chaymanta.
Is it right or wrong?	Allinchu icha mana allinchu.
He doesn’t do what he says.	Manan nisqanman hinachu ruwan.
I don’t know if it was or not.	Manam yachanichu karqa icha manachu.
You don't know how many there are.	Manam yachankichu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
You’re just angry.	Chayllam phiñasqa kachkanki.
Every girl would like to be him.	Sapa sipasmi pay kayta munanman.
I knew mine was cold.	Yacharqanim ñuqapa kaq chiri kasqanmanta.
I don’t want to go.	Manam riyta munanichu.
That was the big secret.	Chayqa hatun pakasqa kaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know that either.	Ñoqapas manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
You know, the real me.	Yachanki, chiqap ñuqa.
But then, he didn’t have to.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, manan chayta ruwananchu karqan.
How he wanted her.	Imaynatachus payta munarqan.
Had a wonderful time.	Sumaq tiempota pasarqa.
I don’t know what that might be.	Mana yachanichu imachus chay kanman chayta.
He means well.	Payqa allintam niyta munan.
I’m sorry to say that.	Chayta nispaymi llakikuni.
You can do this in advance.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwawaq.
That’s all right.	Chayqa tukuy allinmi.
The result was immediately impressive.	Chay ruwasqanqa chaylla admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He knew better now.	Payqa kunanmi aswan allinta yacharqa.
It was a very sad experience.	Chayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
And that’s what you know.	Hinaspa chaytan yachanki.
If you don’t want to, you don’t.	Mana munaspaqa manam.
The man was amazing.	Chay runaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Pretty much so, anyway.	Yaqa chayna, imayna kaptinpas.
Out there somewhere.	Chay hawapi maypipas.
That sounds so simple.	Chayqa ancha facilmi uyarikun.
It’s easy to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayqa facilmi.
But there was nothing there.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaypiqa karqanchu.
It was a very difficult task.	Chayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi karqan.
It is still there today.	Chaypin kunankamapas kashan.
This is really good.	Kayqa chiqap allinmi.
No, he didn’t want to.	Manan, manan munarqanchu.
Yes, more of this, please.	Arí, aswan kaymanta, ama hina kaspa.
I wanted to be a great teacher.	Hatun yachachiq kaytam munarqani.
I'm tired and hungry.	Sayk'usqa, yarqasqa ima kani.
He knows what he’s going to do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruwananta.
What it was, is better.	Imachus karqan, aswan allinmi.
Do it he did it.	Ruway paymi ruwarqa.
I don’t want anyone to know.	Manam munanichu pipas yachananta.
Better late than never.	Aswan allinmi tardeta mana hayk’aqpas.
Most of these are things you don't want.	Yaqa llapan kaykunaqa mana munasqayki hinam.
It was one of all kinds of ideas.	Tukuy laya yuyaykusqanmanta hukninmi karqan.
Many people are difficult.	Achka runakunam sasa.
Saying what I meant.	Niyta munasqayta nispa.
And he was awesome himself, he wanted to know.	Hinaspa pay kikin manchay karqan, yachayta munarqan.
I did nothing there.	Chaypiqa manam imatapas ruwarqanichu.
I’m not there right now.	Manam kunanqa chaypichu kachkani.
But this shouldn’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu kanan.
These people.	Kay runakuna.
But if he doesn’t.	Ichaqa mana ruwaptinqa.
I just didn’t see it.	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu.
Then, one cold night.	Chaymanta, huk chiri tuta.
The first season after this.	Kay qhepaman ñawpaq kaq pacha.
He said so, every time.	Chaynatam nirqa, sapa kuti.
I have no idea who you are.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani pi kasqaykita.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?.	¿Pitaq yachan paqarin punchaw imakuna kananta?.
And then there was nothing left.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manaña imapas karqachu.
Things are much easier now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi imapas kachkan.
I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.	Manam yachanichu paqarin imakuna pasananta.
I wouldn’t do that.	Manam chaynataqa ruwaymanchu.
I want to do that more.	Chayta astawan ruwayta munani.
He told me he would not be home for a while.	Paymi niwarqa huk tiempo mana wasinpi kananta.
I can’t wait to see it.	Mana suyayta atinichu chayta rikuyta.
If they want to do it, fine.	Sichus ruwayta munanku chayqa, allinmi.
He noticed things.	Payqa imakunatapas repararqanmi.
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
He has a very good sense of humor.	Payqa ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi.
And that’s something that last year, didn’t exist.	Hinaspa chayqa imapas qayna wata, mana karqanchu.
How can I do that?	Imaynatataq chayta ruwayman.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi karqa.
However, there is a downside here.	Ichaqa, kaypiqa kanmi huk mana allin.
That’s not always true.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu cheqaq.
He was right about that.	Chaytaqa allintam nirqa.
I don't feel like I'm tired.	Manam sayk'usqa hinachu tarikuni.
That is certain now.	Chayqa kunanqa segurom kachkan.
You know this is for the best.	Yachankim kayqa allinpaq kasqanmanta.
I don’t think it’s a good thing.	Manam allin kananpaqchu piensani.
It was much easier.	Aswan facilmi karqa.
It was good but could have been better.	Allinmi karqan ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
It certainly wasn’t here.	Chiqamanta mana kaypichu karqa.
Everyone is him.	Tukuy runa pay.
No, they were really mad at me.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin ñoqawan phiñasqa karqanku.
Building was a constant.	Wasi ruwayqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
And that seems like an easy lesson.	Hinaspa chayqa facil yachay hinam.
He was a very big man everywhere.	Payqa maypipas ancha hatun runam karqa.
It didn't look like much.	Manam anchatachu rikchakurqa.
This is unfortunate.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi.
Why should you do that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwanayki.
But he couldn’t, not quite yet.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu, manaraqmi allintachu.
It is not difficult to do so.	Chayta ruwayqa manam sasachu.
In fact, there is.	Chiqaptaqa, kanmi.
I doubt he’ll come back.	Iskayrayani kutimunanta.
He was a teacher.	Payqa yachachiqmi karqan.
Again, again, again.	Yapamanta, yapamanta.
It came out again this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi yapamanta lluqsirqa.
I like it, he says.	Gustanmi, nispas nin.
I probably should do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay.
I didn’t expect that.	Manam chaynataqa suyarqanichu.
I really want you to do that.	Anchatan munani chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I’m a girl.	Ñuqaqa sipasmi kani.
Maybe he’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman.
So go big.	Chaymi hatun riy.
I couldn’t get over the fact that he was gone.	Manañan kasqanmantaqa manan atipayta atirqanichu.
I have to do what I have to do.	Imachus ruwanay tiyan chayta ruwanay tiyan.
"You can't do that, you can't leave town," he said.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu, manam llaqtamanta lluqsiyta atiwaqchu, nispas nin.
And it actually worked out well.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa allintam lluqsirqa.
Can't figure out what it is.	Mana ima kasqanmanta yuyaymanayta atinchu.
And you know this.	Hinaspa kayta yachanki.
Now, everybody knows that.	Kunanqa, llapa runam chaytaqa yachanku.
I didn’t know what it was like.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allin kaqmi karqa.
He refused to let her go.	Payqa manan munarqanchu ripunanpaq.
There was no one at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manam pipas karqachu
Very good guy.	Ancha allin runa.
I’m going to go over that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi risaq.
I’m really sorry, but .	Chiqamanta llakikuni, ichaqa .
He doesn’t care about that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
They want to get there.	Chayman chayayta munanku.
Then we did something a little different.	Chaymantaqa huk chikan imatapas ruwarqayku.
He wants to do it again, he wants another chance.	Payqa hukmanta ruwayta munan, huk oportunidadta munan.
Yes, next week.	Arí, hamuq semana.
He was the guy.	Payqa chay runam karqa.
I didn’t know about it.	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
He has been gone for about a week.	Yaqa huk semana hinam manaña kanchu.
It was bitterly cold that morning.	Chay paqarinmi sinchi chiri kasqa.
Then two things happened.	Chaymantam iskay imapas pasarqa.
He will be gone from most of his past.	Payqa manañan yaqa llapan ñawpaqpi hinachu kanqa.
You were sure, very sure.	Seguro karqanki, ancha seguro.
But there is a problem.	Ichaqa kanmi huk sasachakuy.
A very great knowledge.	Huk ancha hatun yachay.
Everything has a purpose.	Tukuy imapas kanmi imapaqpas.
Why, why, why.	Imarayku, imarayku, imarayku.
And you .	Hinaspa qamqa .

I was there, too.	Ñuqapas chaypim karqani.
Maybe too many.	Ichapas ancha achka.
However, these are not very good.	Ichaqa, kaykunaqa manan ancha allinchu.
But he thought better of it.	Ichaqa aswan allintan yuyaykurqan.
He will be fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kanqa.
Man is the whole process.	Runaqa tukuy ima ruwaymi.
It really isn't like any other.	Chiqaptaqa manam huk hinachu.
Please let me know as soon as possible.	Ama hina kaspa, usqhaylla willaway.
Me too.	Ñuqapas.
A lot of time.	Achka tiempo.
That was a huge accomplishment.	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi karqa.
Now I’m here to stay.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkani.
I sure don’t want that to happen to you.	Seguro mana munanichu qanwan chay pasananta.
And that’s the beautiful thing.	Hinaspa chaymi sumaq kaq.
They weren’t there.	Paykunaqa manam chaypichu karqaku.
But I can’t be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atinichu.
But, he kept doing it.	Ichaqa, hinallam ruwarqa.
He didn’t want the job.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chay llank’anata.
Not every day, anyway.	Mana sapa punchawchu, imayna kaptinpas.
He really wanted to go.	Payqa anchatan riyta munarqan.
Was everything ever okay?	¿Hayk’aqllapas hayk’aqllapas tukuy imapas allinchu karqan?
He wants that very much.	Chaytaqa anchatam munan.
This is a learning process.	Kayqa yachay ruwaymi.
I had an idea that might work.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi karqani, chaymi allin kanman.
I really want this.	Kaytaqa anchatam munani.
Time, that’s the problem.	Tiempo, chaymi sasachakuy.
It’s amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi.
This really happened.	Kayqa chiqaptam pasarqa.
People really take that route every.	Runakunaqa chiqaptam chay ñanta sapa.
I don’t know if anyone has refused this money before.	Mana yachanichu sichus pipas ñawpaqta kay qullqita mana munarqanchu chayta.
But I’m not sure why it’s good.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani imarayku allin kasqanmanta.
This morning was really easy.	Kay paqarinmi chiqap facil karqa.
Do what you want!	¡Munasqaykita ruway!
This is probably the best way.	Kayqa yaqapaschá aswan allinqa kanman.
Many don’t.	Achka mana.
I don’t think you should, you know.	Manam yuyanichu chayta ruwanaykita, yachanki.
He would have done it.	Ruwanman karqan.
I felt like a new person.	Musuq runa hinam tarikurqani.
This was the real him.	Kaymi karqan cheqaq pay.
But of course it doesn’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana.
I’m really glad we did.	Chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I couldn't say for sure.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman karqa.
I have only me and everything to blame.	Ñuqallam hinaspa tukuy imamanta huchayoq kani.
It is usually busy.	Yaqa llapanpim ocupasqa kachkan.
It’s cold.	Chiri kachkan.
Well hidden, whatever.	Allin pakasqa, imapas.
But no one is here.	Ichaqa manan pipas kaypiqa kanchu.
He’s a very big guy.	Payqa ancha hatunmi.
I didn’t think it through.	Manam allintachu piensarqani.
And the process continues.	Hinaspa chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
But that was a big if.	Ichaqa chayqa hatun sichus karqan.
I am just as cold as you are.	Ñuqapas qam hinam llumpay chiri kachkani.
He knew it wouldn’t happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
But there are older people.	Ichaqa kanmi kuraq runakuna.
It was actually quite nice.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That beautiful man.	Chay sumaq runa.
He knew about it.	Payqa chaymantam yacharqa.
But that was ridiculous.	Ichaqa chayqa asikunapaq hinan karqan.
I felt sick.	Unqusqa hinam tarikurqani.
This sounds familiar.	Kayqa riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
That's what happened there.	Chayqa chaypim pasarqa.
So maybe that’s what happened.	Chaymi ichapas chayna pasarqa.
Yeah why not.	Arí imaraykutaq mana.
But you don’t have to do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwanayki.
It seemed like it would be.	Chayqa kanman hinam rikchakurqa.
They were happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqam karqaku.
I don’t intend to do that.	Manam chayta ruwaytaqa yuyaykunichu.
This isn’t easy though.	Kayqa manan facilchu ichaqa.
I never thought it would be you.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu qam kananta.
It was a wonderful day.	Chay punchawqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But if there is such a thing, this is it.	Ichaqa sichus chay hina kaq kanman chayqa, kaymi.
But, yeah, I am.	Ichaqa, arí, ñuqam kani.
This is the second largest island.	Kaymi iskay kaq hatun wat'a.
I’m an adult.	Ñuqaqa kuraq runam kani.
That’s a good girl.	Chayqa allin sipasmi.
I have been there for a long time.	Unayñam chaypi kachkani.
All night sometimes.	Tukuy tuta wakin kuti.
It is very hard for me to do that.	Ancha sasam ñuqapaq chayta ruwayqa.
Everyone agreed to that.	Chaypaqqa llapallankum acuerdopi karqaku.
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
There was, first of all, the man himself.	Chaypin kasharqan, ñawpaqtaqa, kikin runa.
And you’re cold.	Hinaspa chiri kanki.
That’s not a very good thing.	Chayqa manam ancha allinchu.
He took some time.	Payqa wakin tiempotan hap’irqan.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
He wanted to live there.	Chaypi tiyayta munarqa.
I’m not too worried though.	Manam anchatachu llakikuni ichaqa.
He was so tired.	Payqa chay hina sayk’usqa kasqa.
I wonder about that.	Chaymantam tapukuni.
This didn't take very long.	Kayqa manam ancha unaytachu pasarqa.
The same, to make it easier.	Chay kikin, aswan facil kananpaq.
It wasn’t going to be easy.	Manam facilchu kanan karqa.
Better yet right now.	Aswan allinqa kunanpacha.
The process is difficult, but not difficult.	Chay ruwayqa sasam, ichaqa manam sasachu.
But the truth is he never gets what he wants.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi mana hayk’aqpas munasqanman hinachu.
It never existed.	Mana hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
They are wonderful people.	Paykunaqa sumaq runakunam kanku.
Not so sure.	Mana chayna segurochu.
Everything that’s there.	Tukuy chaypi kaq.
This is going to be a very difficult year.	Kayqa ancha sasa wata kanqa.
How to learn!.	¡Imaynatataq yachay!.
That will be very difficult.	Chayqa ancha sasam kanqa.
I was the guy who was.	Ñuqaqa chay runam karqani.
I can’t seem to help it.	Manapaschá yanapayta atiymanchu hina.
It’s obvious that he did.	Sut’inmi chay ruwasqanqa.
I can’t stop them.	Manam chaykunataqa harkayta atiymanchu.
Actually, that’s pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa ancha allinmi.
They haven’t been good for a long time.	Unayñan mana allinchu kashanku.
I couldn’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu.
A cup of coffee, please.	Huk kukata, ama hina kaspa.
But it would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi kanman.
Baby, do you really think it's that easy.	Wawa, chiqaptachu yuyanki chayna facil kananpaq.
I don’t know what they are.	Manam yachanichu imakuna kasqankuta.
I was so nervous, nervous and excited.	Ancha mancharisqa, mancharisqa, kusisqa ima karqani.
He didn’t say thank you or anything.	Payqa manan gracias nitaq imatapas nirqanchu.
They’re wonderful,’ he says.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku’, nispas nin.
It will be better.	Aswan allinmi kanqa.
The more stuff, the better.	Aswan achka imakuna kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Or, you know.	Utaq, yachanki.
In fact, nothing like him.	Chiqaptaqa, manam imapas pay hinaqa.
He doesn’t know about it yet.	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa yachanchu.
I know what's going to happen there.	Yachanim chaypi imakuna kananta.
It’s not just me.	Mana ñuqallachu.
He knew it wasn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
That’s what he did, of course.	Chaytan ruwarqan, sut’inmi.
He usually eats once a day.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim sapa punchaw huk kutilla mikun.
I don't know how many times.	Mana yachanichu hayka kutita.
And tell me about it.	Hinaspa chaymanta willaway.
Many are injured each year.	Achka sapa wata k’irisqa kanku.
That was something good.	Chayqa imapas allinmi karqa.
He’s the one who did it.	Paymi chaytaqa ruwarqan.
It’s nice to know.	Sumaqmi yachay.
He was too sure of her for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay segurom karqa paymanta.
He always spoke his mind.	Payqa sapa kutim piensasqanmanta rimaq.
This was the third step.	Kayqa kimsa kaq ruwaymi karqa.
And now they know it doesn’t exist.	Hinaspa kunan yachanku mana kasqanmanta.
So be the best at what you do.	Chaymi imatapas ruwaspaqa aswan allin kaq kay.
He doesn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwanchu.
That’s probably what you know.	Chayqa yaqapaschá yachanki.
He left this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi ripurqan.
It may not be like me, it may not be like you.	Manapaschá ñoqa hinachu kanman, manapaschá qan hinachu kanman.
He didn’t want to play with me.	Payqa manan ñoqawan pukllayta munarqanchu.
Not there or anywhere else.	Mana chaypichu nitaq maypipas.
He said he had no idea.	Payqa mana ima yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta nirqa.
What is this likely to be?	¿Imaynataq kay kanman?
It was amazing, actually.	Admirakuypaqmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
But he didn’t think so.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu yuyaykurqan.
You were certainly rude to me.	Cheqaqtapunin ñoqawanqa mana allin rimaq karqanki.
I can't find it anywhere.	Manam maypipas tarinichu.
I'm pretty sure.	Allintam seguro kani.
All in all, he's doing great.	Tukuy ima, payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
He told me where to go.	Mayman rinaypaq niwarqa.
Can’t remember his name but he’s a good player.	Mana sutinta yuyariyta atinichu ichaqa allin pukllaqmi.
I wonder what his name should be.	Tapukuni ima sutinmi kananmanta.
They’re not there.	Manam chaypichu kanku.
That, actually, was pretty easy.	Chayqa, chiqaptaqa, ancha facilmi karqa.
It may not work out.	Manapaschá allintachu ruwanqa.
I feel so bad right now.	Kunanqa ancha mana allintam sientekuni.
I don't see that.	Chaytaqa manam rikunichu.
But this one time.	Ichaqa kay huk kutilla.
Where have you been.	Maypitaq karqanki.
He is successful on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi allinta ruwan.
Who knows how many people.	Pi yachan hayka runakuna.
There was so much to do.	Ancha achka ruwaymi karqa.
The process was familiar.	Chay ruwayqa riqsisqa karqa.
Can he be able to do that? 	¿Atinmanchu chayta?
He said he had never been anywhere so good.	Payqa nirqam mana haykapipas maypipas chayna allin kasqanmanta.
If only he were.	Sichus pay kanman chayqa.
It probably doesn’t exist.	Yaqapaschá mana kanchu.
I didn’t expect him not to.	Manam suyarqanichu mana ruwananta.
No one was ready.	Manam pipas listochu karqa.
The man looked at her intently.	Chay runaqa anchatan qhawarirqan.
I don’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yachanichu.
He is the greatest man.	Paymi aswan hatun runa.
And yes, that person is me.	Hinaspa arí, chay runaqa ñuqam kani.
He was the only one.	Payqa chayllam karqa.
He didn’t say that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa nirqanchu.
Anything more than me.	Imapas aswan ñuqa.
That seems pretty good.	Chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
I know you have to.	Yachanim chayta ruwanayki kasqanmanta.
Yes, it can be very difficult.	Arí, sinchi sasa kanman.
No one is there.	Mana pipas chaypichu.
You don’t know what you’re doing? 	Manachu yachanki?
That’s the way it was.	Chayna kasqa.
That would be good for him.	Chayqa allinmi kanman paypaq.
I can’t get out of it.	Manam lluqsiyta atinichu.
I didn’t really know what.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imamanta.
He said he was angry.	Payqa phiñasqa kashasqanmantan nirqan.
Let someone know it’s okay.	Pimanpas allin kashasqanmanta willay.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinqa karqan.
It was a really big deal.	Chiqap hatun ruwaymi karqa.
He couldn't drive.	Payqa manam carrota manejayta atirqachu.
He hurried home.	Payqa usqhayllan wasinman ripurqan.
I hope it comes soon.	Suyachkani chaylla hamunanta.
That was supposed to be the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinqa kanan karqan.
If you ever do.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas.
He is a married man.	Payqa casarasqa runam.
Whatever it was, he wanted it.	Imapas chaypi kaptinqa, payqa munarqa.
He thought maybe he could.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman nispa.
I hope to see you there!.	¡Suyachkani chaypi rikuyta!.
He’s not sure what the truth is.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan imachus cheqaq kasqanmanta.
He said he couldn't work here anymore.	Payqa manañam kaypi llamkayta atisaqchu nispa.
Here’s how .	Kaypi imayna .
Now I wanted to do it.	Kunanqa ruwayta munarqani.
Everything else.	Tukuy imakuna.
Tell me about it.	Chaymanta willaway.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Of course, we’ve done this before.	Chiqamanta, kayta ñawpaqta ruwarqayku.
He was very stern.	Payqa ancha sinchitan rimarqan.
You are so great.'	Ancha hatunmi kanki’, nispa.
I have to do something with it.	Chaywanmi imatapas ruwanay.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
It will make more sense.	Aswan yuyayniyuqmi kanqa.
They know full well that they disagree.	Paykunaqa allintam yachanku mana acuerdopi kasqankuta.
It says a lot.	Achkatam riman.
He does things like this all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim kayna ruwaykunata ruwan.
Both are eager to see him.	Iskayninkum anchata munanku payta qawayta.
He wasn't going to be happy about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta kusisqachu kanan karqan.
He couldn’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atirqachu.
That was lucky.	Chayqa suerteyoqmi karqan.
Maybe the weather is right.	Ichapas tiempo allin kanman.
Something happened, happened, something happened.	Imapas pasarqa, pasarqa, imapas pasarqa.
He is not sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan.
And two people.	Hinaspa iskay runa.
He tried to stop her.	Payqa hark’ayta munarqan.
This is a beauty.	Kayqa sumaq kaymi.
He can do that.	Payqa chaytan ruwanman.
He wanted to play.	Payqa pukllayta munarqa.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Manam facil ruwaychu.
Someone will be there immediately.	Pipas chaylla chaypi kanqa.
And every day.	Hinaspa sapa punchaw.
He really doesn’t know.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana yachanchu.
Sure, he says.	Seguro, nispas nin.
No one tried to stop him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta munarqanchu.
I know exactly what happened.	Allintam yachani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
And that’s what you want.	Hinaspa chaytam munanki.
I did well with it.	Chaywanmi allinta ruwarqani.
Yes, this was the day.	Arí, kay punchawmi karqa.
If it had been that easy, she would have been here before.	Sichus chay hina facil kanman karqan chayqa, ñawpaqtaraqmi kaypi kanman karqan.
So he wasn’t happy.	Chaymi mana kusisqachu kachkarqa.
Things looked good, but they weren't.	Imapas allinmi rikchakurqa, ichaqa manam allinchu karqa.
He can't tell.	Payqa manam willayta atinchu.
He said he felt very alone.	Paymi nirqa ancha sapallan sientekusqanmanta.
I don’t want to know things.	Manam imakunatapas yachayta munanichu.
I can't work out how many there might be.	Manam llamkayta atiymanchu hayka kanman chayta.
And this is very unfortunate.	Hinaspa kayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
I really don't understand why.	Chiqaptaqa manam entiendenichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
It was a cold day.	Chay punchawqa chiri punchawmi karqa.
This is a maybe.	Kayqa huk ichapas.
It’s a nice evening.	Sumaq ch’isi.
Who did the job?	¿Pitaq chay ruwayta ruwarqa?
I don’t know if there will be tomorrow.	Mana yachanichu paqarin kanqachu icha manachu chayta.
He won’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwanqachu.
He felt too sick to help her.	Payqa llumpay unqusqa hinam tarikurqa, chaymi mana yanapayta atirqachu.
You know what what it is.	Yachanki ima ima kasqanmanta.
There is no time for that.	Chaypaqqa manan tiempo kanchu.
I was married, once.	Casarasqa karqani, huk kuti.
Not yet, at least.	Manaraqmi, aswanpas.
Not like it is today.	Mana kunan tiempopi hinachu.
I know why you are here.	Yachanim imanasqa kaypi kasqaykita.
Meaning, very bad.	Niyta munan, ancha mana allin.
Tell me again his name, first and last.	Hukmanta willaway sutinta, ñawpaqta, qhipa kaq ima.
I had no idea he was there.	Manam chaypi kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
I’ve always heard it.	Sapa kutim uyarirqani.
I don’t want you to be like that here.	Manam munanichu kaypi chayna kasqaykita.
It’s not really there.	Manam chiqaptachu chaypi kachkan.
I really can’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam atiymanchu.
What was your character like?	¿Imaynataq karqanki?
You are here, and that is what matters.	Qam kaypi kachkanki, chaymi ancha allinqa.
Some of that now.	Wakin chayta kunan.
Again, maybe he is.	Yapamanta, ichapas payqa kanman.
Probably really important.	Yaqapaschá chiqaptapuni ancha allin.
That was certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
He was not going to fail at it.	Payqa manan chaypiqa mana allintachu ruwanan karqan.
It’s been thirty years.	Kimsa chunka watañam.
It was a funny night.	Chay tutaqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I don’t know how, but he was right.	Manan yachanichu imaynatachus chayta, ichaqa allintan nirqan.
They were happy and excited.	Paykunaqa kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam karqaku.
That wasn’t really the case.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
I don't see why you would.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa chayta ruwasqaykita.
And that’s what’s available now.	Hinaspa chaymi chay kunan tarikun.
Not here, not anywhere.	Mana kaypichu, mana maypipas.
We cannot talk about it.	Chaymantaqa manam rimayta atichwanchu.
You can’t say no.	Mana niyta atiwaqchu.
I don’t know how it is.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
I had a better idea, anyway.	Aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani, imayna kaptinpas.
Everything must be ready.	Tukuy imapas listo kanan.
Like a human being.	Runa hina.
Even if it is so good.	Chayna allin kaptinpas.
Maybe something about me.	Ichapas ñuqamanta imapas.
I couldn’t figure out who this person was.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu pi kay runa kasqanmanta.
Seriously, there’s no telling what could happen.	Serio, mana willay kanchu imachus kanman chayta.
There is nothing I can do about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
A good guy.	Allin runa.
Repeat this process several times.	Kay ruwaytaqa achka kutita ruwana.
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa.
They were wrong, you know.	Paykunaqa pantasqa karqanku, yachanki.
More than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan allinqa.
Who really knows.	Pitaq chiqaptapuni yachan.
I said thank you.	Gracias nispaymi nirqani.
You seem so nervous about everything.	Tukuy imamanta ancha mancharisqa hinam kanki.
I’m still the same.	Hinallam chayna kachkani.
Once a week thereafter.	Chay qhepamanmi semanapi huk kutilla.
This is not funny.	Kayqa manam asikunapaq hinachu.
I didn’t expect it to happen.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna kananta.
So I have to be.	Chaymi ñuqa kanan.
If a.	Sichus huk.
He did that tonight.	Chaytaqa kunan tutam ruwarqa.
Here again everything went wrong.	Kaypim yapamanta tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
It was a beautiful night.	Sumaq tutam karqa.
I can’t, really.	Manam atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe one day I'll have to make one.	Ichapas huk punchaw hukta ruwanay kanqa.
I can’t do it now.	Manam kunanqa ruwaymanchu.
So I’m very nervous about it.	Chaymi anchata manchakuni chaymanta.
You can’t stay.	Manan qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
Now this house.	Kunan kay wasi.
Please don't be.	Ama kaychu.
But this guy isn’t.	Ichaqa kay runaqa manan.
He certainly wasn’t a yes man.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana arí runachu karqan.
You were serious.	Serio karqanki.
That’s a no-brainer.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
But he didn’t need to.	Ichaqa manan necesitarqanchu.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Seguro kani kutimunanta.
Okay, okay, this was good.	Allin, allin, kayqa allinmi karqa.
This is going to be a very, very interesting year.	Kayqa ancha ancha sumaq wata kanqa.
Does anyone know how to play? 	¿Pipas pukllayta yachanchu?
Do something different.	Huk chikan ruwayta ruway.
I really mean that.	Chiqamanta chayta niyta munani.
I don’t want to see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikuyta munanichu.
He was always in trouble.	Payqa sapa kutim sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Here, anywhere.	Kaypi, maypipas.
It's really not that hard to do.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna sasachu ruwayqa.
And this was now.	Hinaspa kayqa kunanmi karqan.
This was him.	Kayqa paymi karqan.
Did everything go well?	¿Allinchu tukuy imapas pasarqa?
Beautiful, beautiful house.	Sumaq, sumaq wasi.
But no more, man.	Ichaqa manañan, runa.
Maybe everything else.	Ichapas tukuy ima.
That happened about a year ago.	Chayqa pasarqa yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
The latter of these.	Kay qhipa kaq.
They are real people.	Paykunaqa chiqap runakunam.
That was certainly not true.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana cheqaqchu karqan.
I went there for an hour and a half.	Chaypim huk hora kuskan rirqani.
And this is one of them.	Hinaspa kayqa hukninmi.
I'm actually very sorry.	Chiqaptaqa anchatam llakikuni.
And he said something interesting.	Hinaspa huk sumaq kaqta nirqa.
This will happen tomorrow.	Kayqa paqarin punchawmi kanqa.
It was a good evening.	Allin ch’isi karqan.
It didn’t seem real.	Manam chiqap hinachu karqa.
Most of the time, that is up to you.	Yaqa llapanpim chayqa qammanta kanqa.
It came out amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi lluqsirqa.
Now, one last chance.	Kunanqa, huk qhipa chansa.
If so, it will be good.	Chayna kaptinqa, allinmi kanqa.
And people are.	Hinaspa runakunaqa kanku.
It’s very interesting here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.
Two, three times a week.	Iskay, kimsa kuti semanapi.
No, never again.	Manan, manaña hayk’aqpas.
What is he talking about.	Imamantataq rimachkan.
I’m glad he’s here.	Kusikuni kaypi kasqanmanta.
No, he was being ridiculous.	Manan, payqa asikunapaq hinan kasharqan.
That was three years ago.	Chayqa kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I couldn’t find one.	Mana hukta tariyta atirqanichu.
The two were a good marriage.	Iskayninkum allin casarasqa karqaku.
From the city.	Llaqtamanta.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kanchu.
I didn’t think of that.	Manam chaytaqa piensarqanichu.
But now it was fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi karqan.
But that’s easy.	Ichaqa chayqa facilmi.
But now he is gone.	Ichaqa kunanmi manaña kanchu.
Which is a very good thing.	Imataq ancha allin.
I knew where this was going.	Yacharqanim mayman kayqa risqanmanta.
To do something.	Imatapas ruwananpaq.
And the house.	Hinaspa wasi.
It gave him a sense of satisfaction.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kayta qorqan.
I really think something is wrong.	Chiqaptam imapas mana allin kasqanmanta piensani.
The tennis crowd was upset.	Tenispi kaq runakunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
Don’t go to that.	Ama chaymanqa.
He’s younger than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan sullk’a.
Very nice guy.	Ancha sumaq runa.

They weren’t good enough.	Paykunaqa manam allinchu karqaku.
We did things.	Imakunatapas ruwarqayku.
I never noticed this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa repararqanichu.
Didn't say much today.	Manam anchatachu nirqa kunan punchaw.
A world that doesn’t make any sense.	Mana imapas yuyayniyuq pacha.
He never wanted to be.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kayta munarqanchu.
I think this is the best way to do most things.	Yuyaykuni kay hina aswan allin ruwayqa yaqa llapan ruwaykunata ruwanapaq.
And do it.	Hinaspa ruway.
I know what the problem is!	¡Yachanim ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta!
It would be very useful.	Ancha allinmi kanman.
It was a very difficult task for him.	Chay ruwayqa llumpay sasam karqa paypaq.
I mean it was just so cold.	Niyta munani chaylla ancha chiri kasqanmanta.
Which is the least.	Imataq aswan pisi.
There is no certainty here.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu.
He did want to drive himself, but he refused.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin pay kikin carrota manejayta munarqan, ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
I know it could be worse.	Yachanim aswan mana allin kanman chayta.
Say it with me.	Ñoqawan niy.
I don't know if this is correct though.	Mana yachanichu sichus kay allinchu ichaqa.
I hope he knows what he’s doing.	Suyachkani ima ruwasqanmanta yachananta.
He was, of course, enjoying himself.	Payqa, chiqamanta, kusisqa kachkarqa.
Maybe they have an idea.	Ichapas huk yuyayniyuq kanku.
But no one really is.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu chhayna.
You’re beautiful, too.	Qampas sumaqmi kanki.
It’s really, really easy.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta facil.
It’s really nice.	Chiqamanta sumaqmi.
Explain why why.	Willay imarayku imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He was a big, tough, tough player.	Payqa hatun, sinchi, sinchi pukllaqmi karqan.
But there is no point in talking about it now.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kunan chaymanta rimayqa.
When do you ever know?	¿Hayk’aqmi hayk’aqllapas yachanki?
I am a good teacher.	Allin yachachiqmi kani.
But someone was there, okay.	Ichaqa pipas chaypi kasqa, allinmi.
Fewer people	Aswan pisi runakuna
More money than that.	Astawan qullqita.
He was very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi karqa.
He wasn’t a bad guy, of course.	Payqa manan millay runachu karqan, cheqaqtapunin.
This will be the last one.	Kaymi kanqa qhepa kaq.
There was nothing for it.	Chaypaqqa manam imapas karqachu.
Someone has to do it.	Pipas chayta ruwananpaqmi ruwanan.
This has to be the year.	Kayqa wata kanan tiyan.
It would be really good.	Chiqamanta allin kanman.
But that's the only downside.	Ichaqa chayllam mana allinqa.
He knew he had done it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
And so it went on.	Hinaspa chayna rirqa.
You just can’t beat it.	Chaylla mana atipayta atiwaqchu.
Not everyone knows every language.	Manan llapa runachu sapa simita yachan.
Please don’t do that again.	Ama hina kaspa, amaña chayta ruwaychu.
It should be easy.	Facilmi kanan.
Three people.	Kimsa runakuna.
Ten o'clock in the morning.	Chunka tutamanta.
It’s still not good enough.	Hinallam mana allinchu.
What is the name of the	Imataq sutin.
I probably didn’t want to know.	Manachá yachayta munarqanichu.
All right, man.	Allinmi, runa.
First day of school.	Ñawpaq p’unchaw yachay wasi.
But I don’t want him.	Ichaqa manan paytaqa munanichu.
It’s very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi.

I don’t really know how to say it.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imayna niyta.
I don’t feel that way anymore.	Manañam chaynatachu sientekuni.
It seemed like a foregone conclusion.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi rikchakurqa.
It’s certainly not an easy task.	Chiqamanta mana facil ruwaychu.
But there was something.	Ichaqa imapas karqa.
It means something is good.	Imapas allin kasqanmantam niyta munan.
Okay, more often than not.	Allinmi, aswan sapa kuti.
That’s not me anymore.	Chayqa manañam ñuqachu kani.
They were all guilty.	Llapallankum huchayoq karqaku.
One quick thing though.	Huk utqaylla kaq ichaqa.
That is all that needs to be done now.	Chayllam kunanqa ruwana.
No one wants to hear that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas uyariyta munanchu.
Been there and done that.	Chaypi kaspa chayta ruwarqani.
I think a lot of people are.	Yuyaykuni achka runakuna chayna kasqankuta.
Man, that’s great.	Runa, chayqa ancha allinmi.
No one told him to do this.	Manan pipas nirqanchu kayta ruwananpaq.
We are very happy that we did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
He had no choice but to do it.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, chaytan ruwanan karqan.
I don’t need that.	Manam chaytaqa necesitasaqchu.
You never know why.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
He was very proud of this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso karqa.
Yes, we did.	Arí ruwarqayku.
It was a set up.	Chayqa karqan huk churasqa.
No no no no no.	Mana mana mana mana mana.
That’s the last thing.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi.
This he knew.	Kaytaqa payqa yacharqanmi.
I always wanted to look good.	Sapa kutim allin rikchayniyuq kayta munarqani.
Twenty years next month.	Iskay chunka wata hamuq killapi.
Obviously this was not going to be easy.	Sut’inmi kayqa mana facilchu kanan karqan.
We are good together.	Kuska allinmi kanchik.
A great one, and you did well.	Huk hatun, hinaspa allinta ruwarqanki.
I didn’t really do it.	Manam chiqaptachu ruwarqani.
Be a part of this!.	¡Kaymanta huknin kay!.
He wants her to come home.	Payqa munanmi wasinman kutimunanta.
That was a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allin kaymi karqa.
Doing this a few times will make it easier.	Chayta iskay kinsa kutita ruwayqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
So that wasn’t supposed to be here.	Chaymi chayqa mana kaypichu kanan karqan.
And, well he shouldn’t.	Hinaspa, allinmi mana ruwananchu.
But it was clear.	Ichaqa sut’inmi karqan.
He wasn’t happy about it.	Manam chaymanta kusisqachu karqa.
It was a performance.	Chayqa ruwaymi karqan.
Maybe you’re ready, maybe you’re not.	Ichapas listoña kachkanki, ichapas mana.
Perhaps it was the present.	Yaqapaschá kunan tiempo karqan.
She said why not.	Payqa nirqam imanasqataq mana nispa.
He was a fool.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Maybe next summer?.	Ichapas hamuq verano?.
But that is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
He was caught in the act.	Payqa chay ruwaypi hap’isqa karqan.
I don't know what he thinks, what he knows and what he doesn't know.	Manam yachanichu ima piensasqanmanta, ima yachasqanmanta hinaspa mana yachasqanmanta.
I catch a lot of it.	Achkatam hapini.
You probably know why.	Yaqapaschá yachanki imarayku chayta.
More on that than that.	Astawan chaymanta.
So everything else is a go.	Chaymi tukuy imapas huk riy.
Where it was supposed to be.	Maypitaq kanan karqa.
I thought he was a really nice guy.	Chiqap sumaq runa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I have to disagree with that.	Chaywanmi mana acuerdopichu kanay.
Maybe they were outside.	Ichapas hawapi karqaku.
I just learned about it.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani.
That's a lot of good.	Chayqa achka allinmi.
Okay, he did it.	Allinmi, payqa ruwarqa.
I'm sure you look beautiful.	Seguro kani sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqaykita.
I want to hear more about that.	Chaymanta astawan uyariyta munani.
What do you want to eat?	¿Imatataq mikhuyta munanki?
Everything will happen.	Tukuy imapas kanqa.
But is he really innocent?	Ichaqa, ¿cheqaqtachu mana huchayoq?
It’s like last week.	Qayna semana hinam.
Very good.	Aswan allinmi.
The walker is a walker.	Puriq runaqa puriq runam.
Maybe say something.	Ichapas imatapas niy.
And very happy about it.	Hinaspa ancha kusisqa chaymanta.
And this one time.	Hinaspa kay huk kutipi.
But they are a few days behind schedule.	Ichaqa iskay kinsa p’unchay qhepamanmi kashanku.
He couldn't say anything.	Payqa manam imatapas niyta atirqachu.
But he knows it's early.	Ichaqa yachanmi temprano kasqanmanta.
That's why he bought this.	Chayraykum kayta rantirqa.
I want to know how he did it.	Imayna ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani.
That will come next week.	Chayqa hamuq semanan hamunqa.
There is an easier way to do it.	Aswan facil ruwaymi kan.
What is it and man?	¿Imataq hinaspa runa?
And then do something about it.	Hinaspa chaymanta imatapas ruway.
But, never mind.	Ichaqa, ama hayk’aqpas.
He wasn’t quite sure what he wanted to do next.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imatachus qhepaman ruwayta munasqanmanta.
He didn’t want to say it anymore.	Payqa manañan niyta munarqanchu.
For good, of course.	Allinpaq, sut’inmi.
This was very easy.	Kayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
And yes, she looked at him.	Hinaspa arí, payta qhawarisqa.
Anything is easy.	Imapas facilmi.
Now, the other thing.	Kunanqa, huk kaq.
This guy is good.	Kay runaqa allinmi.
Still, people seem to like it.	Chayna kaptinpas runakunaqa gustan hinam.
Obviously, it was not to be.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
Do this whole process twice a week.	Kay tukuy ruwayta iskay kutita semanapi ruwana.
He didn’t know he would know how.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna ruwaytapas yachananta.
Never quite right.	Mana hayk’aqpas allintachu.
This is yours now.	Kayqa kunanmi qanpa.
It has to be done that way.	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwana.
I didn’t want to ask at first.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam tapuyta munarqanichu.
This is a big time for me.	Kayqa hatun pacha ñuqapaq.
I don’t feel right.	Mana allintachu sientekuni.
You can’t ask him.	Manam paytaqa tapuyta atiwaqchu.
Then it was.	Chaymantam karqa.
I don't know what happened now.	Manam yachanichu kunan ima pasasqanmanta.
You said you couldn’t stand it.	Mana aguantayta atisqaykita nirqanki.
So it does that.	Chaymi chayta ruwan.
In fact, it seems to be the case.	Aswanpas chayna hinam kachkan.
Otherwise it makes no sense.	Mana chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
That’s so nice of you.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi qanmanta.
No, thank you.	Manan, gracias.
Another approach would be appropriate.	Huk ruwaymi allin kanman.
I’m very good at it.	Ancha allinmi chaypiqa kani.
However, many people may not be sure.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá askha runakuna mana segurochu kanku.
Very much this.	Anchata kay.
They are never in a hurry.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu kanku.
I hadn’t thought of that before.	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
That was a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
And that's what happened.	Hinaspa chaymi chayna karqa.
It wasn’t the day.	Manam punchawchu karqa.
This is foolish rather than foolish.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymantaqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi.
I don’t really have an opinion.	Manam chiqaptachu huk yuyayniyuq kani.
That doesn’t mean it.	Chayqa niyta munanchu.
That happened once before.	Chayqa huk kuti ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
That’s why he was there.	Chayraykum payqa chaypi karqa.
But this isn’t the worst part.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan mana allinchu.
I would love to see her there.	Anchatan munani chaypi rikuyta.
Is it right or wrong?	¿Allinchu icha manachu?
I can’t think of anything.	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atinichu.
I didn’t know what he was doing.	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna ruwasqanmanta.
Okay, if that was the case.	Allinmi, sichus chayna karqa chayqa.
There will be more tomorrow afternoon.	Paqarin tarde aswan kanqa.
You need to act quickly.	Usqhayllan imatapas ruwanayki.
If he has it.	Sichus paypaq kan chayqa.
It was a wonderful time.	Ancha sumaq tiempon karqan.
I didn’t want to leave a message.	Manam huk willakuyta saqiyta munarqanichu.
Makes a great baby gift.	Hatun wawa regalota ruwan.
Now, it seemed like the right thing to do.	Kunanqa, allin ruwayman rikchakurqa.
Yes, he is a good man.	Arí, allin runa.
It’s nice to be here with him.	Paywan kaypi kayqa sumaqmi.
But he didn't realize it.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa repararqanchu.
But, that was it.	Ichaqa, chaymi karqan.
He asked her twice what was going on, but she couldn’t answer.	Iskay kutitan tapurqan imachus pasashasqanmanta, ichaqa manan kutichiyta atirqanchu.
Not like he was worried or anything.	Mana llakisqa hinachu nitaq imapipas.
But he left very happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqan ripurqan.
Time to go.	Rinaypaq tiempo.
He is alone there.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi kachkan.
I don't really like him.'	Payqa manan anchatachu gustan’, nispa.
I want to be happy.	Kusisqa kaytam munani.
There’s something really great about that.	Chaypiqa kanmi imapas chiqap hatun.
You don't want to work there anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam chaypi llamkayta munankichu.
I can’t do anything about that.	Chaytaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atiymanchu.
Please let me know if this makes no sense.	Ama hina kaspa, kay mana yuyayniyuq kaptinqa willaway.
You’re proud of it.	Chaymantam orgulloso kanki.
Maybe it’s the same thing.	Ichapas chayna kaq kanman.
This is obviously not the case.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
This was the right thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi karqan.
When was it happening?	¿Hayk’aqmi karqan?
It’s never difficult.	Manam haykapipas sasachu.
For example .	Kay hina .
It was an easy day.	Chayqa facil punchawmi karqa.
That was probably the hardest part.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan sasa karqan.
I can’t remember it.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu.
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He tried to speak but couldn't.	Rimayta munarqa ichaqa manam atirqachu.
It didn’t happen often.	Manam sapa kutichu pasarqa.
They were happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska kusisqa karqanku.
It looked beautiful.	Sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
That is not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.
A very bad one, actually.	Ancha mana allin kaq, chiqaptaqa.
It just sort of happened.	Chaylla huk laya pasarqa.
There, that’s better.	Chaypi, chayqa aswan allinmi.
It came from almost nothing.	Yaqa mana imamanta hamurqa.
That's the 'where'	Chayqa 'maypi' nisqa.
This isn’t worth it.	Kayqa mana valenchu.
He looked at the door.	Payqa punkuta qhawarisqa.
They were very popular.	Ancha riqsisqa karqanku.
Three times a week.	Semanapi kimsa kutita.
He is as great as you are.	Payqa qan hina hatunmi.
That it was never bad for you.	Qampaq mana haykapipas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I want to be sure.	Seguro kaytam munani.
He tried to drive, but couldn’t.	Payqa carrota manejayta munarqan, ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I am going to do my best.	Tukuy atisqayta ruwanaypaqmi kachkani.
You were there for me.	Chaypim karqanki.

I hear them all the time now.	Chaykunataqa kunanqa sapa kutim uyarini.
I hope you do a better job.	Suyachkani aswan allin llamkayta ruwanaykita.
And now, he won’t do it.	Hinaspa kunanqa, manan ruwanqachu.
He had a pretty good idea.	Payqa allintan allinta yuyaykurqan.
I know you know things.	Yachanim imakunatapas yachasqaykita.
So you think you’re smarter, right?	Chaymi aswan yachaysapa kasqaykita yuyanki, ¿aw?
He is eventually arrested.	Payqa qhepamanmi hap’isqa kashan.
Last year was a wonderful year.	Qayna wata sumaq wata karqan.
How’s it going for you.	Imaynataq qampaq.
That was the first one.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqa.
It’s really interesting.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq.
What is this if this and what is that.	¿Imataq kay sichus kay hinaspa imataq chay.
I knew something was coming.	Yacharqanim imapas hamunanta.
I’m afraid to do anything.	Imatapas ruwayta manchakuni.
It must be the truth.	Chiqap kaqmi kanan.
That was not too difficult.	Chayqa manam ancha sasachu karqa.
Who wants to drive?	¿Pitaq carrota manejayta munan?
He wants to look good.	Payqa allin rikchayniyuq kaytam munan.
But it was amazing.	Ichaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It was hard to talk to him.	Paywan rimayqa sasam karqa.
That was him, too.	Chayqa paymi karqan.
Those people want to do it right now.	Chay runakunaqa kunanpacha ruwayta munanku.
That is what happened in the world.	Chaynatam kay pachapi pasarqa.
If not, let me know.	Mana chayna kaptinqa willaway.
No, there was no alternative.	Manan, manan huk ruwayqa karqanchu.
He said he was fine.	Payqa allinmi kani nisqa.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I have no idea what it is.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima kasqanmantaqa.
It was really nice though.	Chiqamanta sumaq karqa ichaqa.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
Where there is nothing.	Maypichus mana imapas kanchu.
But I don’t know for what.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imapaqpas.
I can't believe he's here.	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqanmanta.

A while anyway.	Huk rato imayna kaptinpas.
To learn more about him.	Paymanta astawan yachananpaq.
I thought it would be good.	Allin kananpaqmi piensarqani.
The process did not go well.	Chay ruwayqa manam allintachu rirqa.
They know better than they do.	Paykunaqa aswan allintam yachanku.
I won't be able to catch him.	Manam payta hapiyta atisaqchu.
He didn’t want to do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
It was really easy actually.	Chiqaptam facil karqa chiqaptaqa.
He was mad at her.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa paypaq.
He can never be a human being.	Manam haykapipas runachu kanman.
He wanted to be alone.	Payqa sapallan kaytam munarqa.
I'm sure not.	Seguro kani mana.
I still hope it goes well.	Hinallam suyachkani allinta pasananta.
I don’t want to be that person anymore.	Manañam chay runa kayta munanichu.
I didn't know when you'd be.	Mana yacharqanichu hayk'aqmi kanki.
Someone else does it.	Huk runam ruwan.
Everything would be nice.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi kanman.
In fact, he really wanted it.	Chiqaptaqa anchatam munarqa.
No one could tell.	Manam pipas yachayta atirqachu.
They want this.	Kayta munanku.
I know nothing about that.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu.
Probably a lot of time.	Yaqapaschá achka tiempo.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim atisqaykita.
I can’t speak to you.	Manam rimayta atiymanchu.
Forgive me for being him.	Pampachaykuway pay kasqanmanta.
I didn’t know that at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
It’s out there.	Chay hawapi kachkan.
You look like him.	Pay hinam rikchakunki.
He had it right.	Payqa allintan chayta hap’isqa.
He wanted to be with us.	Payqa ñuqaykuwan kuska kaytam munarqa.
So he wanted to know what was going to happen.	Chaymi payqa yachayta munarqa imakuna pasananta.
I never really thought about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
The longer it takes.	Aswan unayta.
But I’m happy now.	Ichaqa kunan kusisqa kashani.
I was there again.	Hukmanta chaypi karqani.
So you can do that.	Chaymi chaytaqa ruwawaq.
Do something that is right.	Imapas allin kaqta ruway.
Didn't want to think about it.	Mana chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqanchu.
I worry about it as much as you do.	Ñuqapas qam hinam chaymanta llakikuni.
He won’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
No one likes to be miserable.	Manan pimanpas gustanchu llakisqa kaytaqa.
He sounds strong.	Payqa sinchitan uyarikun.
He wanted to be bigger.	Payqa aswan hatun kaytam munarqa.
We disagree almost immediately.	Yaqa chayllam mana acuerdopichu kanchik.
This patient is really sick.	Kay unqusqa chiqamanta unqusqa kachkan.
I really have to do it.	Chiqaptam ruwanay.
It sounds amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi uyarikun.
And that’s me.	Hinaspa chaymi ñuqa.
Don't be afraid.	Ama kanchu.
I was lucky enough to be a part of it.	Suerteyoqmi karqani chaymanta huknin kanaypaq.
No he won’t do it.	Manan payqa manan ruwanqachu.
He wasn't there, but he knows.	Payqa manam chaypichu karqa, ichaqa yachanmi.
I can't say when.	Manam haykapi niyta atiymanchu.
But that’s what we did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqayku.
I’m not there for it.	Manam chaypichu kani.
No one could do it.	Manan pipas atirqanchu.
But that’s not going to happen.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa nispa.
He lives alone now.	Payqa kunanqa sapallanmi tiyan.
That seemed to be true.	Chayqa chiqap hinam karqa.
He wanted to know what she wanted to know.	Payqa yachayta munarqa ima yachay munasqanmanta.
It’s still mine.	Hinallam ñuqapa.
I never wanted that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa munarqanichu.
He knew there were three of them.	Payqa yacharqanmi kinsa kasqankuta.
They were like a second home to him.	Paykunaqa iskay kaq wasi hinam karqaku paypaq.
But he realized, again, that this wasn’t true.	Ichaqa repararqanmi, yapamanta, kayqa mana cheqaqchu kasqanmanta.
But do it right away.	Ichaqa chaylla ruway.
This was the best part of the night.	Kaymi tutamanta aswan allin kaq karqa.
The right person, the right time.	Allin runa, allin pacha.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imachus kananta.
He can't wait.	Mana suyayta atinchu.
And again, it’s a big event in town this weekend.	Hinaspa yapamanta, hatun ruwaymi llaqtapi kay semana tukukuypi.
I can’t imagine it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu.
Being unpopular.	Mana allin qhawarisqa kayqa.
I’m sure he didn’t.	Seguro kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I knew that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yacharqani.
Surprisingly, everything was great.	Admirakuypaqmi tukuy imapas ancha allin karqa.
There is nothing right here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu.
That’s how it is, sometimes.	Chhayna kayqa, wakin kuti.
They love the party.	Paykunaqa anchatam munanku chay fiestata.
There really is no reason.	Chiqaptaqa manam kanchu imaraykupas.
That sounds about right.	Chayqa yaqa allinmi uyarikun.
It’s a difficult thing to do.	Sasa ruway.
Is this something?	¿Kay imapas?
He had a good idea of ​​what was going on.	Payqa allintan yuyaykurqan imachus pasashasqanmanta.
Yes, that went well.	Arí, chayqa allintam pasarqa.
He is quite a handsome man.	Payqa allin sumaq rikchayniyuq runam.
They want to party.	Paykunaqa fiestata ruwayta munanku.
Everything has its time.	Tukuy imapas kanmi tiempon.
You usually want to do this.	Yaqa llapanpim kayta ruwayta munanki.
John was very angry.	Juanqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
Make listening a daily practice.	Uyariyta sapa punchaw ruway.
Another big problem.	Huk hatun sasachakuy.
No one is sure why.	Manan pipas segurochu kashan imarayku kasqanmantaqa.
I’ll do the talking.	Rimayta ruwasaq.
But eventually he was there.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi chaypi kasharqan.
And the people were angry.	Hinan runakunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
He doesn’t want to hear about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta uyariyta munanchu.
That one is mine.	Chay hukninmi ñuqapa.
He wouldn’t be like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
I want him to be.	Payta munani.
But there is no other option.	Ichaqa manan huk ruwayqa kanchu.
Can anyone do that.	Pipas chayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
This would be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanman.
He said he knew.	Payqa yachanmi nisqa.
Say a month.	Huk killa niy.
I know two games.	Iskay pukllayta yachani.
Annual.	Sapa wata.
But here we are.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkaniku.
Do a little different.	Huk chikan ruway.
But this one really does.	Ichaqa kayqa cheqaqtapunin ruwan.
I like this the best.	Kaymi aswan allinta gustan.
It looked very unattractive.	Ancha mana sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
He wasn’t there.	Payqa manan karqanchu.
All or nothing.	Tukuy utaq mana imapas.
You’re here to stay.	Kaypi kanki.
He didn’t know how much it was, or how bad it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a kasqanmanta, nitaq hayk’a millay kasqanmanta.
I'm going to talk to him.	Paywan rimaq risaq.
No one wants to talk about that fact.	Chay cheqaq kasqanmantaqa manan pipas rimayta munanchu.
Everything was good for me.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa ñuqapaq.
Thanks again, for everything.	Hukmanta gracias, tukuy imamanta.
Without it, nothing will happen.	Mana kaptinqa manam imapas kanqachu.
Maybe they’re on to something.	Ichapas imapipas kachkanku.
I'm not sure exactly why.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
As always, he knew the right thing to do.	Sapa kuti hinam, allin kaqta yacharqa.
This is the moment.	Kaymi chay rato.
Which was a good thing.	Imataq allin karqa.
That it is useless.	Mana imapaqpas kasqanmanta.
You can't answer this.	Kaytaqa manam kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
Probably for the better.	Yaqapaschá allinpaq.
I mean, we’re not sure.	Niyta munani, mana segurochu kanchik.
The other easy one.	Huknin facil kaq.
Can't help how it looks.	Mana yanapayta atinchu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
He didn’t say that.	Payqa manan chaytachu nirqan.
He wants to see it very much.	Anchatam qawayta munan.
Maybe no one was right.	Ichapas mana pipas allinchu karqa.
But it doesn’t matter anymore.	Ichaqa manañan imananpaschu.
He said he didn't like it.	Paymi nirqa mana gustasqanmanta.
He asked me what it was.	Paymi tapuwarqa imataq chay kasqanmanta.
He gave me a lot.	Achkatam quwarqa.
This is a serious one.	Kayqa sinchi hatunmi.
I know you are worried about him.	Yachanim paymanta llakisqa kasqaykita.
That everything is more beautiful.	Tukuy imapas aswan sumaq kasqanmanta.
Action information.	Ruway willay.
Do that a lot.	Chaytaqa anchata ruway.
I can never speak to it.	Manam haykapipas chaymanqa rimayta atiymanchu.
Now I wonder where he lives.	Kunanqa maypi tiyasqanmanta tapukuni.
I wish I could have.	Munaymanmi karqan chayta.
He declined to comment further.	Payqa manan munarqanchu astawan rimayta.
The people were nice.	Runakunaqa sumaqmi karqaku.
I heard it at night.	Tutan uyarirqani.
He was here to stay.	Payqa kaypi kasqa.
But then he knew what he had to do.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi yacharqan ima ruwananta.
I just thought how lucky he was to be rich.	Chaylla yuyaykurqani imayna suerteyoqmi qhapaq kasqanpi.
This coffee is very good.	Kay kukata ancha allin.
One man was in trouble.	Huk runam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
You’re going to be very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kanki.
He didn’t think of that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
If mine will do, fine.	Sichus ñuqapa ruwanqa chayqa, allinmi.
More than once, maybe.	Aswan huk kuti, ichapas.
However, it was cold.	Ichaqa, chiri kasqa.
Like this house.	Kay wasi hina.
Speaking of course does no good.	Chiqamanta rimayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
That is too much to do.	Chayqa llumpay ruwaymi.
It just came out.	Chayllaraqmi lluqsirqa.
So I wasn’t good at this.	Chaymi mana allinchu karqani kaypi.
He knew what that was like.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay imayna kasqanmanta.
But it could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allin kaq.
Coffee is good here.	Kaypiqa kukata allinmi.
Can you repeat that?	¿Atiwaqchu chayta yapamanta rimayta?
We are not happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanchik.
He probably would do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanman.
Tough.	Sasa.
And not very good, either.	Hinaspa mana ancha allinchu, nitaq.
And then the second one.	Hinaspa chaymanta iskay kaq kaq.
Ready to go.	Rinanpaq listoña.
I still don’t understand them.	Kunankamapas manam chaykunataqa entiendenichu.
He is no longer here.	Payqa manañam kaypichu kachkan.
But it will be tomorrow.	Ichaqa paqarinmi kanqa.
You can’t do it.	Manam atiwaqchu.
No one wants to talk.	Manan pipas rimayta munanchu.
I never wanted to do this.	Manam haykapipas kayta ruwaytaqa munarqanichu.
No one knows what to do.	Manan pipas yachanchu ima ruwananta.
But, maybe it is.	Ichaqa, ichapas chayna kanman.
Which was absurd, really.	Imataq mana yuyayniyuq karqa, chiqamanta.
He never really gets to talk to her though.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni paywan rimayta atinchu ichaqa.
What could be this problem.	Imataq kay sasachakuy kanman.
He was a man of cold weather.	Payqa chiri tiempopi runam karqa.
He had no idea if this thing would work.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kay imapas allinchu kanman icha manachus chayta.
This is what he wants.	Kaytam payqa munan.
You don't really want that to happen.	Manam chiqaptachu munanki chayna kananta.
He was in big trouble now.	Payqa kunanmi hatun sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
It was something.	Imapas kasqa.
He wasn’t a great guy.	Manam hatun runachu karqa.
And they got a little drunk every night.	Hinaspa sapa tuta huk chhikanta machasqa karqanku.
Then again, maybe they were.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas paykunaqa karqaku.
Maybe every moment of every day.	Ichapas sapa punchaw sapa rato.
He is fine and will be happy soon.	Payqa allinmi kashan, pisi tiempollamantan kusisqa kanqa.
That’s ten years.	Chayqa chunka wata.
That's pretty clear by now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa ancha sut'inmi.
They want you to be better than you are.	Paykunaqa munanku qanmanta aswan allin kanaykita.
Here and there.	Kaypi chaypi.
What in the world are you doing? 	¿Imatataq kay pachapi ruwachkanki?
I don’t know what it’s for.	Manam yachanichu imapaqpas.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Manachá imananpaschu.
One important thing.	Huk importante kaq.
An only child there.	Huk sapallan wawa chaypi.
That's pretty fast.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam.
It probably should have been.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanan karqa.
I don’t want to hear this.	Manam kayta uyariyta munanichu.
I know how that is.	Yachanim imayna chay kasqanmanta.
He quickly came to his senses.	Payqa usqhayllan allinta yuyaykurqan.
He was seriously uncomfortable.	Payqa sinchitan mana allinchu karqan.
This is the first step.	Kaymi ñawpaq kaq ruwayqa.
I can't figure out how to correct the error.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imayna pantasqa allichayta.
You just keep going.	Qamqa hinallam riy.
He said who he was.	Paymi nirqa pi kasqanmanta.
I did pretty well.	Allin allintam ruwarqani.
Tell me again.	Hukmanta willaway.
No, thank you, she said.	Manan, gracias, nispas nin.
The whole process was very easy.	Tukuy chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
He knew all too well the feeling.	Payqa allintan yacharqan chay sientekusqanmanta.
But there is some truth.	Ichaqa kanmi wakin cheqaq kaq.
He came to my house today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi wasiyman hamurqa.
So maybe this is one.	Chaymi ichapas kayqa huk kanman.
No one seems to know what is going on.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
So he knew how to do it.	Chaymi payqa yacharqa imayna ruwayta.
But I was happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam tarikurqani.
I know it’s good now.	Yachanim kunan allin kaqta.
Go in the middle of the night.	Kuska tutamanta riy.
He couldn't believe he could see it.	Mana creeyta atirqachu rikuyta atisqanmanta.
It doesn’t do that.	Manam chaytachu ruwan.
You are doing better.	Aswan allintam ruwachkanki.
I can't remember how many.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu hayk'a kaqta.
He said it was useless.	Payqa mana imapaqpas kashasqanmantan nirqan.
A first from him.	Paymanta huk ñawpaq kaq.
Everything was as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam karqa.
I really couldn’t stand it anymore.	Chiqaptaqa manañam aguantayta atirqanichu.
But you are a busy man.	Ichaqa ocupasqa runam kanki.
Now it’s that cold.	Kunanqa chay hina chiri.
From the night.	Tutamanta.
People want to know.	Runakunaqa yachayta munanku.
I can’t make a prediction.	Manam huk willakuyta ruwayta atiymanchu.
And this isn’t as stupid as it sounds.	Hinaspa kayqa manan uyarikun hinachu sonso hina.
And if nothing goes wrong, then it's fine.	Hinaspa mana imapas mana allin kaptinqa, chaymantaqa allinmi.
Someone left it here.	Pipas kaypi saqirqa.
It's not a day.	Mana p'unchawchu.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu.
What are you doing today?	¿Imatataq kunan punchaw ruwachkanki?
Everything was very fast.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam karqa.
These people weren’t good enough.	Kay runakunaqa mana allinchu karqanku.
He is the man who told the city first.	Paymi llaqtata ñawpaqta nisqa runa.
He never really did.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
But it took like an hour.	Ichaqa huk hora hinallam pasarqa.
Maybe it’s crazy.	Ichapas loco kanman.
That is the most important thing.	Chayqa aswan importante kaqmi.
It would be nice.	Sumaqmi kanman.
He’s big in the community.	Payqa hatunmi llaqtapi.
I couldn’t figure it out.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
It wouldn’t be true.	Manan cheqaqchu kanman.
But I’m not quite sure how to do this.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatachus kayta ruwayta.
He made such a statement.	Chayna rimayta ruwarqa.
He can’t sleep.	Payqa manam puñuyta atinchu.
He didn’t want to do his homework.	Payqa manan tareankunata ruwayta munarqanchu.
Now, that doesn’t sound too bad.	Kunanqa, chayqa manan ancha mana allinchu uyarikun.
Is it as good as this.	¿Kay hina allinchu.
I know you can't see everything.	Yachanim tukuy imata mana qawayta atisqaykita.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chay nisqanqa allinmi karqan.
I don’t like it.	Manam gustawanchu.
That has always been a problem.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi sasachakuy karqa.
I think that’s interesting.	Chayqa sumaqmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
Obviously, this event is gaining in popularity every year.	Sut’inmi, kay ruwayqa sapa wata aswan allin qhawarisqa kashan.
We are happy with how things turned out.	Kusisqam kachkaniku imayna kasqanmanta.
But he probably did.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
You have to do the action.	Ruwayta ruwanayki tiyan.
We are human beings.	Runakuna kanchik.
Two, three hours at most.	Iskay, kimsa hora aswan achka.
He couldn't see her anymore.	Payqa manañam rikuyta atirqachu.
Act like an adult.	Kuraq runa hina ruway.
It’s been around for a long time.	Unayñan kashan.
But he doesn’t want to go.	Ichaqa manan riyta munanchu.
This was supposed to be a secret.	Kayqa pakasqa kananpaqmi karqa.
Each word is a name.	Sapa rimayqa sutin.
You can’t be serious.	Manan serio kayta atiwaqchu.
That’s who the other person was.	Chayqa pichus huknin runaqa karqan.
You are the one who is.	Qamqa chay runam kanki.
It obviously makes no sense to you.	Sut’inmi qanpaq mana imapaqpas valenchu.
But I don’t feel bad.	Ichaqa manan mana allintachu sientekuni.
He wanted to say something, but he couldn't.	Imatapas niyta munarqa, ichaqa manam rimayta atirqachu.
Probably more than that.	Yaqapaschá aswan achkata.
Better go now.	Aswan allinmi kunan riy.
But I don't know what he means.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu ima nisqanta.
He doesn’t know.	Payqa manan yachanchu.
But it seems to be hidden.	Ichaqa pakasqa hinam kachkan.
I wasn’t here, last year.	Manam kaypichu karqani, qayna wata.
I think we disagree here.	Kaypiqa mana acuerdopichu kanchik, nispaymi yuyaykuni.
In other words, they were.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, chayna karqaku.
He made a fortune.	Payqa qhapaq kaytan ruwarqan.
But it’s certainly no big deal.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana hatun ruwaychu.
I don't believe it will be good.	Manam creenichu allin kananta.
But you go, you go.	Ichaqa qanmi riy.
I don’t know what they are.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqankuta.
I couldn't believe it.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
But they are no longer there.	Ichaqa manañan chaypichu kashanku.
It's very clear.	Ancha sut'inmi.
I know nothing about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu.
No, not yet anything.	Manan, manaraqmi imapas.
Maybe you want to sleep all the time.	Ichapas tukuy tiempo puñuyta munanki.
I had never seen that, before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu, ñawpaqtaqa.
And if it is unknown.	Hinaspa mana riqsisqa kaptinqa.
Maybe ten.	Ichapas chunka.
I want to know someone about it.	Chaymanta pitapas yachayta munani.
They’re really worried.	Chiqamanta llakisqa kachkanku.
Still, he kept going.	Chayna kaptinpas, payqa hinallam ruwarqa.
They weren’t very happy anymore.	Manañam ancha kusisqachu karqaku.
I need this one.	Kayta necesitasaq.
Of course, he didn’t tell you that.	Arí, manan chaytachu nisurqanki.
If he is at home, things will still happen.	Wasinpi kaptinqa hinallam imapas kanqa.
There is a great deal going on.	Hatun ruwaymi kachkan.
He was like the first one.	Payqa ñawpaq kaq hinam karqa.
Do this once, fine.	Kayta huk kutilla ruway, allin.
Not for anything.	Mana imapaqpas.
You’ve done that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqanki.
I don't know where it is.	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
You know, it’s not supposed to be like this.	Yachanki, manan kay hinachu kanan.
This is how it is.	Kay hinam kachkan.
Don't miss the game today!	¡Ama kunan punchaw pukllayta qunqaychu!
Better that than nothing.	Aswan allinmi chay mana imamantapas.
The process was a success.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.
What do you want to convey?	¿Imatataq willayta munanki?
But that was stupid.	Ichaqa chayqa sonso hinan karqan.
I’ve been there before.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaypim karqani.
You don’t know what happened to me.	Mana yachankichu imachus ñuqawan pasasqanmanta.
You have done extremely well.	Sinchi allintam ruwarqanki.
So it looks like, he says.	Chaymi rikchakun, nispas nin.
No one could say what happened.	Manan pipas niyta atirqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
Global performance is considered.	Tukuy pacha ruwaykunata qhawarisqa kanku.
Maybe he’s here.	Ichapas payqa kaypi kachkan.
That’s not a good thing to do.	Chayqa manan allin ruwaychu.
It was sad but wonderful.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
He was tired, very tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa.
Whether it’s there or not.	Chaypin kashan icha manachu.
Every person is important.	Sapa runam ancha allin.
This was going to be difficult.	Kayqa sasam kanan karqa.
I know that, now.	Chaytaqa yachanin, kunanqa.
It doesn’t make sense.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu.
He didn’t like what he said.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chay nisqanmanta.
But that’s what I mean.	Ichaqa chaytan niyta munani.
What’s the matter with you? 	¿Imataq qamwan kachkan?
I think that’s what he wanted to do.	Chaytan yuyaykuni chayta ruwayta munasqanmanta.
Which is very nice.	Imataq ancha sumaq.
Nothing does anything.	Manan imapas imatapas ruwanchu.
I want to win.	Ñuqaqa atipayta munani.
This is the whole thing.	Kaymi llapan.
But that shouldn’t be the case anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chay hinachu kanan.
Nobody does that anymore.	Manañam pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
If it is low, you will not succeed.	Pisi kaptinqa manam allintachu ruwanki.
Maybe next year.	Ichapas hamuq wata.
It was mostly summer time.	Yaqa llapanpim verano tiempo karqa.
Day and night mean nothing.	Tuta punchawqa manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
I'm tired, I'm too busy.	Sayk'usqa, llumpay ocupasqa kani.
I want to turn back time.	Tiempota qhepaman kutichiyta munani.
I look forward to seeing it!.	¡Anchatam suyachkani chayta qawayta!.
I thought it would be great.	Yuyarqanim hatun kananmanta.
He’s going to be a good player.	Payqa allin pukllaqmi kanqa.
That was considered.	Chayqa qhawarisqa karqan.
Later I learned they were.	Qhepamanmi yacharqani paykunaqa.
I had never seen any of them before.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa rikurqanichu.
Maybe it was worse than that.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan mana allin karqa.
And then that’s it.	Hinaspa chaymanta chayta.
Things could have been taken care of.	Imapas allinta qhawarisqa kanman karqan.
Who knows you’re with us.	Pi yachan ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita.
He didn’t seem too worried.	Payqa manan ancha llakisqa hinachu karqan.
They are eager to do so.	Paykunaqa anchatam chayta ruwayta munanku.
I can't be sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam seguro kayta atiymanchu.
I haven’t seen it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
It’s a great way to do it there.	Chaypi ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
They were just great.	Paykunaqa chayraqmi hatun karqanku.
Learn to play the game.	Pukllayta yachay.
You’re more beautiful.	Aswan sumaqmi kanki.
Do everything immediately.	Tukuy imatapas chaylla ruway.
I know everything about it.	Tukuy imatam yachani.
He would be the last person.	Payqa qhepa kaq runan kanman karqan.
I am really doing this.	Chiqaptam kayta ruwachkani.
Now there is.	Kunanqa kanmi.
There you are, right?	Chaypim qamqa kachkan.
He passed alone.	Sapallanmi pasarqa.
Together with him.	Paywan kuska.
He was a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq runam karqa.
There is one or more people.	Huk utaq achka runam kachkan.
It was all about which, where and how and why, why, why.	Tukuy imapas karqa mayqin, maypi hinaspa imayna hinaspa imarayku, imarayku, imarayku.
Everyone knows by now.	Kunankamaqa llapallankum yachanku.
But it might not be that bad.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay hina mana allinchu kanman.
Don’t know if that’s a good thing.	Ama yachankichu sichus chay allinchu kanman chayta.
Beauty, truth, awesomeness.	Sumaq kay, chiqap, manchay.
There is no school in the town.	Chay llaqtapiqa manam yachay wasi kanchu.
One day a guy does it.	Huk punchawmi huk wayna ruwan.
I can't say anything for now.	Kunankamaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
I mean, he's not that kind of person.	Niyta munani, payqa manam chayna runachu.
It seems like yes.	Arí hinam.
He thought he was better.	Payqa aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
He certainly didn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana ruwarqanchu.
Okay maybe do this right.	Allinmi ichapas allinta kay allinta ruway.
And this would be it.	Hinaspa kayqa kanman.
What do you think of it.	Imatataq yuyanki.
They weren’t sure why.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu karqanku imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta.
The first year’s event was a great success.	Ñawpaq wata ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
So he has to do it.	Chaymi ruwanan.
There’s someone here.	Kaypiqa pipas kachkan.
He did this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwaq.
But he couldn’t sleep.	Ichaqa manan puñuyta atirqanchu.
What that might be, he had no idea.	Imataq chay kanman, manas ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
This will never go wrong.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allinchu kanqa.
We need to make it happen.	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwananchik.
Now he knows better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam yachan.
But it was not to be so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanan karqan.
I'm really hungry.	Chiqaptam yarqasqa kachkani.

That’s a lot easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi.
The process was very simple.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha facilmi karqa.
But they are .	Ichaqa paykunaqa .
I don’t want to hear that.	Manam chayta uyariyta munanichu.
But his success was worth it.	Ichaqa allin ruwasqanqa allinmi karqan.
We’re crazy.	Loco kanchik.
He stayed there that night.	Chay tutan chaypi qhepakurqan.
I just found out about it.	Chayllaraqmi chaymantaqa yacharqani.
But there was a problem with that.	Ichaqa chaywanmi huk sasachakuy karqan.
He was a schoolteacher.	Payqa escuelapi yachachiqmi karqan.
I can't say anything about that.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
But it’s not really bad.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu millay.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
That's how long this has been going on.	Chayna unayñam kayqa kachkan.
Who wants to do the wrong thing?	¿Pitaq mana allintachu ruwayta munan?
He was sad but very tired.	Payqa llakisqa kasqa ichaqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
He doesn’t want to be miserable.	Payqa manan munanchu llakisqa kayta.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
Scientists are not sure why.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa manam allintachu yachanku imanasqa kasqanmanta.
It’s night and day.	Tuta punchawmi.
I saw it twice, actually.	Iskay kutitam rikurqani, chiqaptaqa.
I don't know where he is now.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I thought that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
It will be a good day.	Allin punchawmi kanqa.
That’s what you have to do.	Chaynatam ruwanayki.
I can’t sit still.	Manam tiyayta atiymanchu.
But no, there was no one like him.	Ichaqa manan, manan pipas pay hinachu karqan.
He was the most popular.	Paymi aswan allin qhawarisqa karqan.
You probably can’t.	Manapaschá atiwaqchu.
I don’t know that’s true.	Chayqa manan yachanichu cheqaq kananpaq.
Baby.	Wawa.
Someone had to do it.	Pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
He did not do what he said he would do.	Payqa manan nisqanman hinachu ruwarqan.
He was as sad as he was now.	Payqa kunan hina llakisqa kasharqan.
It was clear that something was up.	Sut’inmi karqan imapas kasqanmanta.
I don’t know where but somewhere.	Manam yachanichu maypi ichaqa maypipas.
Do that if you have to.	Chayta ruway sichus ruwanayki kanqa chayqa.
But it’s neither here nor there.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
He was bigger than her.	Payqa paymanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
I'm holding it right.	Allintam hapini.
Now, there I am.	Kunanqa, chaypim kachkani.
It doesn’t need much.	Manam anchatachu necesitan.
He knew it to be a fact.	Huk chiqap kananpaqmi yacharqa.
I can’t walk around.	Manam puriyta atinichu.
I’m going to be a bad person.	Mana allin runam kasaq.
I'll keep going.	Hinallam risaq.
They were afraid to go out.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa karqanku lluqsiyta.
Tonight, he couldn’t sleep.	Kay tutaqa, mana puñuyta atirqachu.
He is happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan.
Learn from it, learn from it, for sure.	Chaymanta yachay, chaymanta yachay, seguro.
He says everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispam nin.
And someone did it.	Hinaspa pipas chayta ruwarqa.
But they are very secure.	Ichaqa ancha segurom kachkanku.
The first thing you do is this.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytan ruwanki.
Things are not as bad as they were twenty years ago.	Imapas manam iskay chunka wata ñawpaqta hinachu mana allinqa.
I want him there.	Chaypim paytaqa munani.

If only there was a better one.	Sichus aswan allin kaq kanman chayqa.
They were both black.	Iskayninkum yana karqaku.
You know he can’t.	Yachanki mana atisqanmanta.
It’s a really big deal.	Chiqap hatun ruwaymi.

But it couldn’t be more than that.	Ichaqa manan chaymanta aswan askha kayta atirqanchu.
It won’t be that easy.	Manan chay hina facilchu kanqa.
The process would be really simple.	Chay ruwayqa chiqaptam mana sasachu kanman.

The old man was angry.	Chay kuraq runaqa phiñasqa kasqa.
You know you’re mine.	Yachankim ñuqapa kasqaykita.
That’s not a good thing he’s done.	Chay ruwasqanqa manan allinchu.
I don’t understand why you think everything so hard.	Mana entiendenichu imaraykun tukuy imata sinchita yuyaykunki chayta.
And then there was the final time.	Hinaspa chaymanta karqan chay qhepa kuti.
He had to be what he was supposed to be.	Payqa imachus kanan karqan chayman hinan kanan karqan.
The man was gone.	Chay runaqa manaña kasqa.
No one is here.	Mana pipas kaypichu.

In fact, he did very well.	Aswanpas ancha allintan ruwarqan.

Every morning and every night.	Sapa paqarin sapa tuta.
He doesn’t want to talk to me.	Manam ñuqawan rimayta munanchu.

But it is a very difficult task.	Ichaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
He’s the one.	Paymi kanki.
However, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Can’t do that anymore though.	Manaña chayta ruwayta atinchu ichaqa.

He wanted to know what it was.	Payqa ima kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
Yeah, yeah, that’s pretty cool.	Arí, arí, chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
He will not do it immediately.	Payqa manan chayllachu ruwanqa.
What will happen to you?	¿Imataq qanmanta kanqa?
One of them was black.	Hukninmi yana karqa.
Again too late.	Yapamanta ancha tarde.
You just have to do it, at least for now.	Chayllaraqmi ruwanayki, kunankamapas.
I don’t see how bad they are.	Manam rikunichu imayna mana allin kasqankuta.

Worse than that.	Aswan mana allin chaymanta.
This is the first morning on earth.	Kaymi kay pachapi ñawpaq paqarin.
The new one.	Musuq kaq.
Two beautiful people with bad intentions.	Mana allin yuyayniyuq iskay sumaq runakuna.
I am very much looking forward to it.	Anchatam suyachkani chayta.
Maybe it’s ugly.	Ichapas millay kanman.
That would be faster and better.	Chayqa aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan allin kanman.
Here we are again.	Kaypi yapamanta kanchik.
A funny thing happened today.	Kunan punchawmi huk asikunapaq hina pasarqa.
I really want him to come back.	Anchatan munani kutimunanta.
He took these things seriously.	Chaykunataqa allintan qhawarirqan.
He did everything right.	Payqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqa.
Something about it.	Imapas chaymanta.
Everyone was there.	Lliwmi chaypi karqaku.
Almost as scared as he was.	Yaqa pay hina mancharisqa.
But that was the best thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwaymi aswan allin karqan.
And, it’s not good.	Hinaspa, mana allinchu.
And so he did.	Hinaspa chaynata pay.
That was just the first one.	Chayqa karqan chaylla ñawpaq kaq.
That doesn’t mean it’s not there.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
We talked all the time.	Tukuy tiempon rimaq kayku.
You will succeed if you apply it.	Chaypaqqa allintam ruwanki chayman hina ruwaptikiqa.
The first night was really cold.	Ñawpaq tutaqa chiqamanta chiri karqa.
It’s not a big deal.	Manan hatun ruwaychu.
Some people are like that.	Wakin runakunaqa chhayna kanku.
We are short-sighted.	Pisi yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I want to hear everything.	Tukuy imata uyariyta munani.
That’s the hard part.	Chayqa sinchi sasa kaqmi.
He is as happy as he can be.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan atisqanman hina.

Then there is such.	Chaymantaqa kanmi chayna.
There will be nothing.	Manam imapas kanqachu.
There is a truth for you.	Kanmi huk chiqap qampaq.
Really, really smart.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta yachaysapa.

They are smart people, very smart.	Paykunaqa yachaysapa runakunam, ancha yachaysapa.

Hopefully he can.	Munaymanmi pay atisqanmanta.
Yes, it probably happened.	Arí, yaqapaschá chayna pasarqa.
I repeated this process three times.	Kay ruwayta kimsa kutita yapamanta ruwarqani.
That’s what he meant.	Chaytaqa niyta munarqa.
It’s pretty big.	Allin hatunmi.
I did it to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi ruwarqani.
I don’t really need them.	Manam chiqaptachu chaykunataqa necesitasaq.
They were the best.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi karqanku.
I thought it went pretty well.	Yuyarqanim allin allinta risqanmanta.
That wasn’t very good.	Chayqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
He can’t hold it though.	Payqa manan hap’iyta atinchu ichaqa.
Like, something about it doesn’t seem real.	Imayna, imapas chaymanta mana chiqap hinachu.
There were some smart people there.	Chaypiqa wakin yachaysapa runakunam karqaku.
He knew he couldn't do that.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I don’t see it anywhere.	Manam maypipas rikunichu.
He was so depressed that he couldn’t sleep.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan, chaymi manaña puñuyta atirqanchu.
We made the walk.	Chay puriyta ruwarqayku.
I don’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikunichu.

So, what happened next.	Chaymi, imataq chaymanta pasarqa.
That would be the worst thing you could do.	Chayqa aswan mana allin ruwaymi kanman.
Do you really want to do this?	¿Cheqaqtachu kayta ruwayta munanki?
He wasn’t easy.	Payqa manan facilchu karqan.
So, that’s about it.	Chaymi, chaymi chaymantaqa.
He realized he could be serious.	Payqa repararqanmi serio kayta atisqanmanta.
Must be very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa kanan.
He really meant it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin niyta munarqan.
The last known failure occurred late last year.	Qhipa riqsisqa mana allin ruwayqa qayna wata tukukuypi karqa.
He has been in prison for twenty years.	Payqa iskay chunka watañam carcelpi kachkan.
Repeat this process a second time.	Kay ruwayta iskay kaq kutita ruwana.
I don't believe all that stuff.	Chay tukuy chaykunataqa manam creenichu.
You will continue to do well.	Hinallam allinta ruwanki.

No one there, either.	Manam pipas chaypiqa, nitaq.

No one else like you.	Mana huk qan hinaqa.

Please do it for yourself.	Ama hina kaspa, qampaq ruway.
They were there for the guys.	Paykunaqa chaypi karqanku.

I couldn’t figure out why.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.

You’re the only one who knows.	Qamllam yachanki.

Ten years ago.	Chunka wata ñawpaqta.
That was one of them.	Chayqa hukninmi karqa.
Like the one in the classroom.	Yachay wasipi kaq hina.
I’m not a morning person at all.	Manam ni imapipas paqarin runachu kani.
I am sure there are people like that in this very hospital.	Seguro kani chayna runakuna kasqanmanta kay kikin hospitalpi.
Maybe, but that's not all.	Ichapas, ichaqa manam chayllachu.
I can do this well.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwayman.
He wasn't sure why.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That in no way agreed with me.	Chayqa manan imaraykupas ñoqawan acuerdopichu kasharqan.
That is essential for success.	Chayqa ancha allinmi allin kananpaq.
He knows it’s bad for him.	Payqa yachanmi paypaq mana allin kasqanmanta.
I never want to do anything else.	Manam haykapipas huk ruwaytaqa munanichu.
But you’ve done it.	Ichaqa qanmi chayta ruwarqanki.

He is here to stay.	Payqa kaypim kachkan.
Someone will come.	Pipas hamunqa.

He wants to see what's out there.	Payqa munanmi chay hawapi imakuna kasqanmanta qawayta.
I had a great idea.	Hatun yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
I still do it all the time.	Kunankamapas sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwani.
A man of good sense.	Allin yuyayniyuq runa.
He was very angry.	Ancha phiñasqa karqan.
I never saw him again.	Manañam haykapipas paytaqa rikurqanichu.
He is the last man.	Payqa qhipa kaq runam.
No one should do it.	Manan pipas ruwananchu.
People want to talk.	Runakunaqa rimayta munanku.
He came alone.	Payqa sapallanmi hamurqa.
He can have you later this afternoon.	Payqa kunan tarde qhepamanmi qanwan kanman.
He repeated this several times.	Chaytan askha kutita yapamanta rimarqan.
Yes, thank you	Arí, gracias .
And for now, that’s a good thing.	Hinaspa kunankamaqa, chayqa allinmi.
I knew he would.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta.
Maybe it’s not the only thing.	Ichapas mana chayllachu.
You’re not doing anything wrong.	Manam mana allintachu ruwachkanki.
You know you have to.	Yachankim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
But now it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
Yeah, he’s that good at this.	Arí, payqa chayna allinmi kay ruwaypi.

I was that it mattered.	Ñuqaqa karqani imapaqpas allin kasqanmanta.
He couldn’t work out where he was.	Payqa manan llank’ayta atirqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I really hope he does well.	Chiqamanta suyachkani allinta ruwananta.
That’s the one.	Chayqa chay.
Now he doesn’t care what happened.	Kunanqa manañan imachus pasasqanmantaqa imananpaschu.
It was a really terrible night.	Chiqamanta manchay tuta karqa.
It’s tough in your mind.	Yuyayniykipiqa sinchi sasam.
This is what I think is coming.	Kaymi hamunanta yuyani.
If he ever does.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas ruwan chayqa.

I’d rather do this than anything else.	Aswan allinmi kayta ruwayman imamantapas.
She's nice, but a little tough.	Payqa sumaqmi, ichaqa huk chikan sinchi.
That was two years ago.	Chayqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.

I have nowhere else to go.	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq kanchu.
I saw that he was at home.	Wasinpi kashasqanmantan rikurqani.
But of course, it’s not true.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, manan cheqaqchu.
It was worth mentioning that.	Chayna kasqanmanta rimayqa allinmi karqa.
He told me he was tired.	Sayk’usqa kashasqanmantan niwarqan.
He felt stupid.	Payqa sonso hinam tarikurqa.
All that young stuff.	Tukuy chay wayna imakuna.
So it won’t be there. 	Chaymi mana chaypichu kanqa. 
An all or nothing and then all over again.	Huk tukuy utaq mana imapas chaymanta tukuy yapamanta imapas.
If you’re not sure, don’t do it.	Mana segurochu kashanki chayqa, ama ruwaychu.
It was a beautiful day.	Chayqa sumaq punchawmi karqa.
It has to be one or the other.	Hukninmi utaq hukninmi kanan.
No one knew where they were.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
But there was one downside.	Ichaqa huk mana allin kaqmi karqa.
I don't know why he's so rude.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa mana allin rimaq kasqanmantaqa.
It has to be there.	Chaypi kanan tiyan.
Not good, but great.	Mana allinchu, aswanpas hatunmi.
That’s a simple fact.	Chayqa huk facil cheqaq kaqmi.
I partied like crazy.	Loco hinam fiestata ruwarqani.
But no, not really.	Ichaqa manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
This is quicker and easier.	Kayqa aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan facilmi.

They’re very serious.	Paykunaqa ancha serio kanku.
For example,	Kay hina,

I don't know him.	Manam paytaqa riqsinichu.
Something was better than being me.	Imapas aswan allinmi karqa ñuqa kaymantaqa.
That sounds ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
He is doing what he can.	Payqa atisqanman hinam ruwachkan.
Everyone wants to know about it.	Lliwmi chaymanta yachayta munanku.
He couldn’t hold it.	Payqa manan hap’iyta atirqanchu.
They don’t exist.	Paykunaqa manan kanchu.
Great man like that.	Hatun runa chayna.

There’s someone who wants to talk to you.	Chaypin pipas qanwan rimayta munan.

You were right about that.	Chaytaqa allintam nirqanki.
Everyone here is a stranger.	Kaypiqa llapa runam mana riqsisqa runa.
There was no time for that.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempo karqachu.

It was freezing cold.	Chayqa chiri chiri karqa.
I seem to have a good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuq hinam kani.
It goes well.	Allintam rin.
But no, he never could.	Ichaqa manan, mana hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.

That is a difficult task.	Chayqa sasa ruwaymi.
Good chance.	Allin chansa.
I don’t know, I don’t want to know.	Manam yachanichu, manam yachayta munanichu.
He seemed very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi rikchakurqa.
There was no better way to say it.	Manam aswan allin rimayqa karqachu.
And in trouble.	Hinaspa sasachakuypi.
He says he won’t go.	Mana risaqchu nin.
You cannot buy that kind of quality.	Chayna allin ruwaytaqa manam rantiyta atiwaqchu.
They want to get out.	Paykunaqa lluqsiyta munanku.
He is indeed present.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kashan.
I can't get out now.	Kunanqa manam lluqsiyta atinichu.
But other people.	Ichaqa huk runakuna.
That’s rather impressive, isn’t it?	Chayqa aswan admirakuypaqmi, ¿aw?
He’s a teacher here, you know.	Payqa kaypi yachachiqmi, yachanki.
He may not have been sure what to do next.	Payqa manapaschá segurochu karqan ima ruwananmanta.
I had to do this to do it.	Kayta ruwanaypaqmi ruwanay karqa.
And that was one of them.	Hinaspa chaymi huknin kaq karqa.

It must be the right thing.	Allin kaqmi kanan.
Go do what you love most.	Aswan munasqaykita ruwanaykipaq riy.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Mana pitapas rikuyta atirqanichu.
He didn’t think it would happen.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chay hina kananta.
He said he couldn't do it himself.	Paymi nirqa mana pay kikin ruwayta atisqanmanta.
But then again, who knows.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ¿pitaq yachan.
Being a real person.	Chiqap runa kay.

When is a good time to stop buying?	¿Hayk’aqmi allin tiempo kanman manaña rantiyta?
I certainly wasn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqani.

Nothing seems familiar.	Mana imapas riqsisqa hinachu.
Do what you have to do.	Imapas ruwanaykita ruway.

Two months ago it was much bigger.	Iskay killa ñawpaqtaqa aswan hatunmi karqa.

That’s why he’s going to do it.	Chayraykum payqa chayta ruwanqa.
That is no longer true.	Chayqa manañan cheqaqchu.
And now there’s no food in the house.	Hinaspa kunanqa mana mikhuy kanchu wasipi.

He expects you to be very happy.	Payqa suyanmi ancha kusisqa kanaykita.

However, it is still not good enough.	Ichaqa, kunankamapas manam allinchu.

But there’s clearly a problem.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kan huk sasachakuy.

I was already crazy.	Ñam loco karqani.
Why do you want that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta munanki.
But that's what I had to do.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwanay karqa.
It would have been obvious.	Sut’inmi kanman karqan.
He is amazing.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi.

You can do them wrong.	Chaykunataqa mana allintam ruwawaq.
There’s not much you can do about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa ruwawaq.

Probably this thing happened to him.	Yaqapaschá kay imapas paywan pasarqa.
We did it last night.	Qayna tutam ruwarqayku.
Almost there, now.	Yaqa chaypi, kunan.
He died later that evening.	Chay ch’isi qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Maybe it was better that he didn't.	Ichapas aswan allin karqa mana chay ruwasqanqa.
He would have been there for a while.	Payqa huk tiempon chaypi kanman karqan.
I do so because I care about you.	Chaynatam ruwani qammanta llakikuni.
But of course it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hina facilchu.
I’m sorry, but .	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa .
He was there for ten days.	Chunka punchawmi chaypi karqa.
Three years in the making.	Kimsa wata ruwaypi.
It seemed fine at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
I didn't know how bad he was hurt.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna millay k'irisqa kasqanmanta.
I wasn’t there.	Mana chaypichu karqani.
I don't think it will take long.	Manam piensanichu unayta pasananta.
It’s not worth it!	¡Manan imapaqpas valenchu!
It’s hard to say.	Sasa niyta.
Now, there was someone.	Kunanqa, pipas karqan.
There is no reason.	Mana imaraykupas kanchu.
If you’re not happy, say so.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, niy.
I just knew it would happen one day.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani huk punchaw chayna kananta.
I hope he comes back soon.	Suyachkani chaylla kutimunanta.
He wants you to be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanaykita munan.
Yes, he was.	Arí, payqa karqa.
He couldn't sleep.	Payqa manam puñuyta atirqachu.
It should be there.	Chaypin kanan.
I never know.	Manam haykapipas yachanichu.
Please let me know what you think about it.	Ama hina kaspa chaymanta willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
But you have to do it right away.	Ichaqa chayllam ruwanayki.
We had to do them together.	Chaykunataqa kuskan ruwanayku karqan.
If, in fact, they were there.	Sichus, chiqaptaqa, chaypi karqaku.
Soon, it will be.	Pisi tiempollamantan, kanqa.
And, in the end, it was too big for him.	Hinaspa, tukukuypi, ancha hatunmi karqan paypaq.
Well done, boy.	Allintam ruwarqanki, wayna.
He couldn’t have been happier.	Payqa manan aswan kusisqachu kanman karqan.
I kept trying.	Hinallam kallpanchakurqani.
But it was really more like this.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin aswan kay hina karqan.
Thirty years later, he did.	Kimsa chunka wata qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
I think that’s the way it is.	Chaynatam piensani.
There are no good people.	Allin runakunaqa manam kanchu.
They were really good at it.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin chaypi allin karqanku.
That was the angry thing.	Chayqa phiñasqa kasqa.
He took it as far as he could.	Atisqanman hinan chayta hap’irqan.
He said it wasn't.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
He is not a good man.	Payqa manam allin runachu.
I doubt anyone would.	Iskayrayani pipas chayta ruwananta.
It just happened to be something.	Chayllaraqmi imapas karqa.
After that, he got a leave of absence.	Chay qhepamanmi permisota chaskirqan.
This seems pretty amazing.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
It was gone, like everything else.	Manañam karqachu, tukuy imapas hina.
That would be huge.	Chayqa hatunmi kanman.
Anyone who plays this game.	Pipas kay pukllayta pukllaq.
I can’t seem to do this.	Manapaschá kayta ruwayta atiymanchu hina.
I really really am.	Chiqaptam chiqaptapuni kani.
He knew what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqanmanta.
He can’t finish it.	Payqa manam tukuyta atinchu.
But, of course, that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqan.
He couldn't get there fast enough.	Chaymanqa manam utqaylla chayayta atirqachu.
I wasn’t sure it would work.	Manam segurochu karqani allin kananta.
So, here it goes.	Chaymi, kaypi rin.
It looked very familiar.	Ancha riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Coming for the first time.	Ñawpaq kutita hamuq.
They were together last night.	Qayna tutam kuska karqaku.
Okay, tomorrow morning.	Allinmi, paqarin paqarin.
I love working outside.	Anchatan munani hawapi llank’ayta.
Like, really hard.	Imayna, chiqap sinchi.
He’s very uncomfortable.	Payqa ancha mana allinchu.
You’re the only one who did it.	Chaytaqa qamllam ruwarqanki.
I always wonder.	Sapa kutim tapukuni.
Go do it.	Riy ruway.
Three times.	Kimsa kutita.
Can’t tell what he’s thinking.	Mana willayta atinchu ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
I wanted it badly.	Mana allintam munarqani.
Do you think he is innocent?	¿Piensankichu mana huchayoq kasqanta?
Everyone was wrong.	Lliwmi pantasqa karqaku.
I know there is more to it than that.	Yachanim chaymanta aswan achka kasqanmanta.
But this is not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kayqa.
I don’t see anyone here.	Kaypiqa manam pitapas rikunichu.
I would be the first to agree with that.	Chaywanqa ñuqam puntata acuerdopi kayman.
What’s the fuck.	Imataq chay millay.
I don’t want to do it again.	Manam munanichu yapamanta ruwayta.
It was indeed the case.	Chiqaptam chayna karqa.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ichapas allin kaq kanman.
This means something is wrong.	Kayqa niyta munan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
There were too many people.	Llumpay achka runakunam karqaku.
He was afraid of that.	Chayta mancharisqa.
You’ve done it.	Qanmi chayta ruwarqanki.
I don’t care about that.	Manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
That was a difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa sasam karqa.
Soon he got his wish.	Pisi tiempollamantan munasqanta chaskirqan.
He doesn't want to leave.	Manam ripuyta munanchu.
What is the problem with this?	¿Imataq chay sasachakuypi tarikun?
They are very good.	Paykunaqa ancha allinmi kanku.
I can’t find it anywhere!	¡Manan maypipas tarinichu!
There is no such thing now.	Kunanqa manam kanchu.
I'll be a man.	Runa kasaq.
I wish I could avoid that.	Chayta mana ruwanaypaqmi munani.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu.
No one is sure.	Manan pipas segurochu.
There are a lot of smart scientists here.	Kaypiqa achka yachaysapa yachaysapa runakunam kachkan.
I thought it was pretty crazy.	Ñuqaqa ancha loco kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Very, very big.	Ancha, ancha hatun.
He has a quick mind.	Payqa usqhaylla yuyayniyuqmi.
He knew a lot of things.	Payqa anchatam yacharqa.
And now it's here again.	Hinaspa kunanqa yapamanta kaypi kachkan.
I certainly do.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwani.
That didn’t work out.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He sounds nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam uyarikun.
He did that this morning.	Chaytaqa kunan paqarinmi ruwarqa.
He just did it recently.	Payqa chayllaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
It was surprisingly true.	Admirakuypaqmi chiqap karqa.
I hope he comes back.	Suyachkani kutimunanta.
I really like just about everything.	Yaqa llapan tukuy imapas anchatam gustan.
This, at this point, was wrong.	Kayqa, kaypi, pantasqa karqa.
Black celebrity is important.	Yana riqsisqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
Now, here it is.	Kunanqa, kaypim kachkan.
That’s why he was here.	Chayraykum payqa kaypi karqa.
He can no longer walk.	Manañam puriyta atinchu.
I want this information.	Kay willayta munani.
Obviously I did that.	Sut’inmi chayta ruwarqani.
Where you want to be.	Maypichus kayta munanki.
So he came to live here.	Chaymi payqa kaypi tiyaq hamurqan.
I hope it never happens to me or anyone else.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas ñuqawan nitaq piwanpas chay pasananta.
She looked back at him.	Payqa qhepamanmi payta qhawarirqan.
We just did one last summer.	Chayraqmi qayna verano hukta ruwarqayku.
He doesn’t think straight.	Payqa mana allintachu yuyaykun.
He opened the door.	Punkuta kicharirqa.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munanichu chaymantaqa.
That one is the hardest.	Chay hukninmi aswan sasa.
I've got one here.	Kaypi hukta hap'ini.
Easy, but wrong.	Facil, ichaqa pantasqa.
There is nothing better.	Manan imapas aswan allinqa kanchu.
But please don’t.	Ichaqa ama hina kaspa.
What do you want to do with it.	¿Imatataq chaywan ruwayta munanki.
But a sad man.	Ichaqa llakisqa runa.
It never quite worked out.	Manam haykapipas allintachu lluqsirqa.
Yes, there they were again.	Arí, chaypi yapamanta karqanku.
A great one.	Huk hatun.
And here it came, here it came, here that .	Hinaspa kaypi hamurqan, kaypi hamurqan, kaypi chay .
Unfortunately, this will not happen immediately.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa manam chayllachu kanqa.
He knew everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yacharqa.
But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiymanchu.
Nobody ever does.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
It was a quick one.	Chayqa usqhayllan karqan.
I didn’t want to think about it anymore.	Manañam yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
It looked like it would do the talking.	Rimayta ruwanman hinam rikchakurqa.
And then twenty.	Hinaspa chaymanta iskay chunka.
But the people there, they know.	Ichaqa chay chaypi kaq runakunaqa, yachanku.
I thought he was crazy.	Loco kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He can be himself again.	Payqa yapamanta pay kikin kanman.
That’s the other one.	Chay hukninmi.
And he knew that.	Hinaspa chayta yacharqan.
First of all, that’s not true.	Ñawpaqtaqa, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I want to tell you what’s going to happen.	Imakuna pasananta willayta munani.
He is yours now.	Payqa kunanmi qanpa.
He wanted to hear more.	Payqa astawan uyariyta munarqa.
Please don’t try to claim them as your own.	Ama hina kaspa, ama chaykunataqa qampaq hinachu niyta munankichu.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.
I couldn't understand it.	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atirqanichu.
There is no sick child.	Manam unqusqa wawa kanchu.
I am very happy with that.	Chaywanmi anchata kusikuni.
You can’t keep up with him.	Manan paywan kuska puriyta atiwaqchu.
He couldn't say anything.	Mana imatapas niyta atirqachu.
This is one of them.	Kayqa hukninmi.
First, they .	Ñawpaqtaqa paykunaqa .
He asked me to do this.	Paymi kayta ruwanaypaq niwarqa.
I’m a fool.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He looked proud of it.	Payqa chaymanta orgulloso hina qhawarisqa.
He had no idea this was bad.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kay millay kasqanmanta.
I don't think he knew anyway.	Manam piensanichu imayna kaptinpas yachasqanmanta.
The people here are great.	Kaypi runakunaqa hatunmi.
They genuinely want to help you succeed.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin yanapayta munanku allinta ruwanaykipaq.
No past, no present, no future.	Mana ñawpaq, mana kunan, mana hamuq pacha.
It was a smart move.	Chayqa yachaysapa ruwaymi karqa.
But now he has to do too much.	Ichaqa kunanqa nishuta ruwanan kashan.
All the best!.	Llapan allin!.
No one knew exactly what was going to happen.	Manan pipas allintachu yacharqan imachus kananta.
A good two weeks went by.	Allin iskay semana pasarqa.
If you don’t, it’s probably not good for you.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa manapaschá allinchu qanpaq.
Every house, every thing.	Sapa wasi, sapa ima.
Tomorrow morning be a morning.	Paqarin paqarin huk paqarin kay.
I really was.	Chiqaptam karqani.
But it’s better to be ready.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi listo kayqa.
But it was there.	Ichaqa chaypim karqa.
So he’ll be ready to go.	Chaymi payqa rinanpaq listoña kanqa.
That means you know what you want.	Chayqa niyta munan ima munasqaykita yachasqaykita.
It’s too cold.	Llumpay chiri.
They were good, but not that good.	Paykunaqa allinmi karqanku, ichaqa manan chay hina allinchu karqanku.
I don’t really want to think this through.	Manam anchatachu kayta yuyaymanayta munani.
That’s where he wanted to be.	Chaypin payqa kayta munarqan.
I'm pretty sure he didn't.	Yaqa segurom kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I’m not really here.	Manam chiqaptachu kaypi kachkani.
I’d rather spend an evening alone.	Aswan allinmi kanman huk ch’isi sapallay kay.
I have a smile on my face.	Ñuqapas kanmi.
He is a day early.	Payqa huk punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi kachkan.
I don't want to see this, ever.	Manam kayta qawayta munanichu, haykapipas.
I’m glad he’s with me.	Kusikuni ñuqawan kasqanmanta.
I don’t want that to happen.	Manam munanichu chayna kananta.
First of all, it doesn’t matter.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imananpaschu.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Manañam imananpaschu.
He’s not like he was ten years ago.	Payqa manan chunka wata ñawpaqta hinachu.
This statement is ambiguous.	Kay rimayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
He’s a little lonely, you know.	Payqa huk chikan sapallanmi, yachanki.
Or the weather.	Utaq pacha.
That was something.	Chayqa imapas karqa.
I couldn’t bear to shop for clothes alone!	¡Manan aguantayta atirqanichu sapallay p’acha rantiyta!
Do nothing but that.	Ama imatapas ruwaychu aswanpas chaytaqa.
That’s what I thought he would do.	Chaytan ruwananta yuyaykurqani.
You have to do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwanayki.
I think it’s a learning process.	Yuyaykuni yachay ruwaymi.
I’m glad we did.	Kusikuni ruwasqaykumanta.
Nothing was supposed to be there.	Manam imapas chaypi kanan karqachu.
He couldn't help it.	Payqa manan yanapayta atinmanchu karqan.
She is a very smart girl.	Payqa ancha yachaysapa sipasmi.
He did well on the first challenge.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan ñawpaq kaq sasachakuypi.
Nothing better than that.	Mana imapas aswan allinqa.
No reason to repeat that.	Mana imaraykupas chayta yapamanta rimanaypaq.
There was always more to it.	Sapa kutim aswan achka imapas karqa.
Both were the majority.	Iskayninkum aswan achka karqaku.
At the time, that was really serious.	Chay tiempopiqa chayqa cheqaqtapunin sinchi hatun karqan.
That was much easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi karqa.
It was a good night.	Allin tutam karqa.
He seemed surprised that he was injured.	Payqa admirasqa hinam karqa k’irisqa kasqanmanta.
I know what he did.	Yachanim ima ruwasqanmanta.
Just tell me when.	Chaylla willaway haykapi.
It won’t be the last time.	Manan qhepa kutichu kanqa.
He wants it right.	Payqa allintam munan.
He couldn't tell her what to do.	Payqa manan ima ruwananta niyta atirqanchu.
I think there are two things there.	Chaypiqa iskay imakuna kasqanmantam piensani.
I know everyone is busy.	Yachanim llapallanku ocupasqa kasqankuta.
I think that is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kasharqan.
But too much is not good.	Ichaqa nishuta ruwayqa manan allinchu.
Where he wasn’t sure.	Maypichus mana segurochu kasqa.
He wasn’t like you.	Manam qam hinachu karqa.
I'm sure it will.	Seguro kani chayna kananta.
Nobody does, really.	Manam pipas ruwanchu, chiqaptaqa.
It’s a good good one.	Allin allinmi.
I don’t know for sure, and neither do you.	Manam allintachu yachani, qampas manam yachankichu.
I learned a lot there.	Chaypin anchata yacharqani.
Then this, then that.	Chaymanta kay, chaymanta chay.
A lot of action happened.	Achka ruwaymi pasarqa.
That’s what he thought he did.	Chaytan payqa yuyaykurqan ruwasqanmanta.
He knew he couldn't say no.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana niyta atisqanmanta.
Certainly not.	Cheqaqtapunin mana.
I don’t need them for anything.	Manam imapaqpas chaykunataqa necesitasaqchu.
Doing it better wouldn’t be easy.	Aswan allinta ruwayqa manan facilchu kanman.
I look forward to hearing from you again.	Suyachkani hukmanta uyariyta.
Yes, this is what he wanted.	Arí, kaymi payqa munarqa.
I know this is true.	Yachanim kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
He couldn't understand what was going on.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
I knew this thing felt funny.	Yacharqanim kay imapas asikunapaq hina sientekusqanmanta.
Of course, they are.	Chiqamanta, paykunaqa kanku.
He doesn't know why he says that.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku chayna nisqanta.
Anywhere in a city.	Maypipas huk llaqtapi.
He seemed very, very happy.	Payqa ancha, ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
That’s pretty easy.	Chayqa allin facilmi.
Were you out today?	¿Kunan punchawchu hawapi karqanki?
After some time he looked up.	Huk tiempo qhepamanmi qhawarirqan.
Just not sure what.	Chaylla mana segurochu imamanta.
I don't like it here.	Kaypiqa manam gustawanchu.
Surprisingly, nothing.	Admirakuypaqmi, mana imapas.
And then no, neither.	Hinaspa chaymanta mana, nitaq.
Is there anything else? 	¿Imapas kanchu?
Maybe it’s better than, you know, what somebody’s done before.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman, yachanki, pipas ñawpaq ruwasqanmanta.
So, he went first.	Chaymi, pay ñawpaqta rirqa.
If so, then yes.	Chayna kaptinqa, chaymantaqa arí.
That’s a good, good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, allinmi.
Or could it have been something else?	Icha, ¿huk ruwaychu kanman karqan?
I certainly learned things.	Cheqaqtapunin imakunatapas yacharqani.
Not much of this makes much sense at all.	Kaymantaqa manam anchatachu ancha yuyayniyuq ni imapipas.
Who, where, how, why, when, what.	Pikuna, maypi, imaynata, imarayku, haykapi, ima.
He will be at the party tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam chay fiestapi kanqa.
But I can’t find anything about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa tarinichu.
Have a sense of humor.	Huk yuyayniyuq kay.
That’s no longer true now.	Chayqa kunanqa manañan cheqaqchu.
It didn’t really matter.	Manam chiqaptachu imapas karqa.
Who is this guy ?	¿Pitaq kay runa ?
Better here out in the open.	Aswan allin kaypi hawapi hawapi.
I didn’t know the whole place.	Manam tukuy maypi kasqanmantaqa yacharqanichu.
It really was about something.	Chiqaptam imamantapas karqa.
There was no time for anything.	Manam imapaqpas tiempo karqachu.
I don’t really know what to say.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani ima niyta.
A little while ago.	Pisi pacha ñawpaqta.
This wasn’t true.	Kayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
It’s just been there.	Chayllaraqmi chaypi.
The process took a lot of care.	Chay ruwayqa anchatan qhawarirqan.
Year, month, day.	Wata, killa, punchaw.
But he is a very good teacher.	Ichaqa ancha allin yachachiqmi.
It wasn’t like it used to be.	Manan ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
Maybe next summer.	Ichapas hamuq verano.
He is badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa kashan.
Worse, actually.	Aswan mana allinqa, chiqaptaqa.
Okay, that’s a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi.
Less was more here.	Aswan pisi kaypi aswan karqan.
Make it better.	Aswan allinta ruway.
Why is he doing that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwachkan?
Are you sure?.	¿Segurochu kanki?.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Manam facilchu chay ruwayqa.
They’re a completely different player.	Paykunaqa huk chikan pukllaqmi kanku.
You can’t do it right away.	Manan chaylla ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Everything went well after that.	Chay qhepamanmi tukuy imapas allinta ripurqan.
There is something really wrong.	Chiqamanta mana allinqa kachkan.
Some people were scared, he said.	Wakin runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku, nispas nin.
They were there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chaypim karqaku.
I've actually never heard of it.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas chaytaqa uyarirqanichu.
It was amazing here.	Kaypiqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Everyone is there for a reason.	Lliwmi chaypi kachkanku imaraykupas.
And then it’s gone.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manaña kanchu.
Worried about him.	Paymanta llakisqa.
He wanted it so badly.	Payqa sinchitan munarqan.
I know people are scared.	Yachanim runakuna mancharisqa kasqankuta.
He had no idea how long before that.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu hayk’a tiempo ñawpaqta chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa.
I know what I am like.	Yachanim imayna kasqayta.
It’s been working for a very long time.	Ancha unayñan llank’ashan.
It’s not good really.	Manam allinchu chiqaptaqa.
He wanted more time.	Payqa aswan tiempotan munarqan.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu.
He gave it to her.	Chaytaqa paymi qorqan.
This is all very important to me.	Kay tukuy ancha importante ñuqapaq.
I want it with me.	Ñoqawanmi munani.
So he did it.	Chaymi ruwarqa.
And do it right.	Hinaspa allinta ruway.
I’d rather have a .	Aswan allinmi kanman huk .
Unfortunately, that's all it does.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayllam ruwan.
The second is the	Iskay kaq.
From here.	Kaymanta.
There are two possibilities.	Iskay ruwaymi kanman.
I am not doing this right.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu ruwachkani.
Tell me who did this.	Willaway pitaq kayta ruwarqa.
You do it, boy.	Qamqa ruwanki, wayna.
It was such a beautiful day.	Chayna sumaq punchawmi karqa.
This makes a lot of sense.	Kayqa anchatam yuyayniyuq.
It had to be both.	Iskayninkum kanan karqa.
She couldn't say how much time had passed.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu hayk’a tiempo pasasqanmantaqa.
Tom is as busy as last year.	Tomqa qayna wata hinam ocupasqa kachkan.
I don’t feel safe.	Manam segurochu tarikuni.
It’s actually quite simple.	Chiqaptaqa ancha facilmi.
I was a little surprised.	Huk chhikantan admirakurqani.
They are great ones.	Paykunaqa hatunmi kanku.
That would have made a story.	Chayqa huk willakuyta ruwanman karqan.
Maybe it was supposed to be the next day.	Ichapas paqarin punchaw kanan karqa.
But this was strongly to be taken seriously.	Ichaqa kayqa sinchitan allinpaq qhawarisqa kanan karqan.
And the people were great.	Hinan runakunaqa hatun karqanku.
And here it was.	Hinaspa kaypi kasqa.
He wants it as much as I do.	Ñoqa hinam payqa munan.
I want to ask you again here.	Kaypi yapamanta tapuyta munani.
And actually maybe that’s the problem.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa ichapas chay sasachakuy kanman.
He was very good at what he did, and he knew it.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa ruwasqanpi, chaytam yacharqa.
I want more time.	Aswan tiempotan munani.
You know where it is here.	Kaypiqa maypichus kachkan yachanki.
It looks like a secret.	Pakasqa hinam rikchakun.
I wonder why.	Tapukuni imarayku.
Here are twenty.	Kaypi iskay chunka.
It was dark.	Tuta kasqa.
He’s not happy about it.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa kusisqachu kashan.
But that’s what we have to do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwana.
Yesterday was the day.	Qayna punchawmi chay punchaw karqa.
He cannot win without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam atipayta atinmanchu.
He is sure of this.	Payqa kaymanta segurom kachkan.
And if not, they’re not.	Hinaspa mana chayqa, manan chay hinachu kanku.
I can never be this.	Manam haykapipas kayta atiymanchu.
They are still with me.	Paykunaqa kunankamapas ñoqawanmi kashanku.
Me too, actually.	Ñuqapas, chiqaptaqa.
He didn’t say that exactly, though.	Payqa manan chaytaqa allintachu nirqan, ichaqa.
They were sad and scared.	Paykunaqa llakisqa, mancharisqa ima karqanku.
I was a lonely person.	Ñuqaqa sapallay runam karqani.
No one will do it.	Manan pipas ruwanqachu.
He says he won’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwanqachu nispan nin.
It may not be right for you.	Yaqapaschá mana qampaq allinchu kanman.
Learn more about it here and here.	Chaymanta kaypi kaypi yachay.
It was a very difficult night to say the least.	Ancha sasa tutam karqa niyta.
To be non-existent.	Mana kananpaq.
Now, here it is.	Kunanqa, kaypi kachkan.
One of them was today.	Hukninmi karqa kunan punchaw.
He wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqa.
I want it so badly for the best.	Ancha mana allintam munani allin kananpaq.
And so it stayed with me.	Hinaspa chay hinaqa ñoqawan qhepakurqan.
Do it again.	Hukmanta ruway.
You were me, you were me.	Qamqa ñuqam karqanki.
I don’t know how he knows, but he does.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam yachan, ichaqa yachanmi.
But he wouldn’t mean it, he can’t say it.	Ichaqa manan niyta munanmanchu, manan niyta atinchu.
But it went well.	Ichaqa allintam rirqa.
But really, to the point.	Ichaqa chiqaptapuni, chayman hina.
All of him.	Llapan pay.
I really wonder this.	Chiqaptam kayta tapukuni.
Maybe this whole thing is crazy.	Ichapas kay tukuy imapas loco kanman.
I’m in the middle of it.	Ñuqapas chaypim kachkani.
But the process was quite impressive.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Perhaps he would have failed without one.	Ichapas mana huknin kaptinqa mana allintachu ruwanman karqa.
He was in a position to speak.	Payqa rimananpaq hinam karqa.
Happy with me.	Kusisqa ñuqawan.
I didn’t think of that.	Mana chayta yuyaykurqanichu.
She was really wonderful.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq karqa.
He seemed nervous at first.	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
I couldn't think without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
But I’m lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kani.
It’s so much easier.	Ancha aswan facilmi.
I haven’t heard much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa uyarirqani.
But he probably wouldn't have done that.	Ichaqa manapaschá chaytachu ruwanman karqan.
So, if you want to go you have to do that first.	Chaymi, riyta munanki chayqa ñawpaqta chayta ruwanayki.
I know how he thinks.	Yachanim imayna piensasqanmanta.
Maybe it was new.	Ichapas musuq karqa.
I didn’t want to though.	Manam munarqanichu ichaqa.
That was a cruel thing to do.	Chayqa millay ruwaymi karqa.
It was amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi karqa.
And he did just that.	Hinaspa chaynata ruwarqa.
In this city.	Kay llaqtapi.
Perhaps something was wrong.	Yaqapaschá imapas allinchu karqa.
But you don’t know that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yachankichu.
Eventually he succeeded.	Qhepamanmi payqa allinta ruwarqan.
Not even you.	Mana qampas.
He probably does that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá ruwan.
I almost feel like they know this.	Yaqapaschá kayta yachanku hina sientekuni.
This is obviously not true.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana cheqaqchu.
Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas chayna kanki.
He’s the one.	Payqa chay.
He is doing very well though, playful and happy.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan ichaqa, pukllaq hinaspa kusisqa.
Then I heard it.	Chaymantam uyarirqani.
Everything you can.	Tukuy ima atisqaykita.
He was really hungry, wasn’t he?	Cheqaqtapunin yarqasqa kasharqan, ¿riki?
It didn't look right.	Manam allintachu rikchakurqa.
Make it about him.	Paymanta ruway.
That’s part of it.	Chayqa chaymanta hukninmi.
He is not sure of anything anymore.	Payqa manañam imamantapas segurochu kachkan.
I really think this is going somewhere.	Chiqaptam piensani kayqa maymanpas rinanpaq.
He’s not feeling well.	Payqa manan allinchu kashan.
You have done these things well.	Chaykunataqa allintam ruwarqanki.
Happy new year!.	Sumaq musuq wata!.
We are one and the same.	Huk hinallam kanchik.
He was glad he couldn’t see her.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan mana rikuyta atisqanmanta.
A different person.	Huk chikan runa.
He repeated the process twice.	Iskay kutitam chay ruwayta yapamanta ruwarqa.
It’s something that’s yours.	Chayqa imapas qampaq kaqmi.
Can you swim?	¿Atiwaqchu nadayta?
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu karqan.
I don’t really know how it happened.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna pasasqanmanta.
Kind of ridiculous.	Imayna asikunapaq hina.
This seemed reasonable.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
We soon followed suit.	Pisi tiempollamantan chayman hina ruwarqayku.
There was no one here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas karqachu.
He knows exactly why.	Payqa allintam yachan imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Which would be so good.	Imataq chayna allin kanman.
I knew I was going to.	Ñoqaqa yacharqanim.
There is nothing between you and me.	Qamwan ñuqawanqa manam imapas kanchu.
He’s that type of player.	Payqa chay laya pukllaqmi.
Everything is good for him now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi paypaq.
This happened once a week now.	Kayqa semanapi huk kutitam kunanqa pasarqa.
I just don’t understand it.	Chaylla mana entiendenichu.
Now the process would be very fast.	Kunanqa chay ruwayqa ancha utqayllam kanman.
Everyone wants them.	Lliwmi chaykunataqa munanku.
It would be better to do so.	Aswan allinmi kanman chayta ruwayqa.
Now it’s as bad as ever.	Kunanqa ñawpaq hina mana allinmi.
This was supposed to be.	Kayqa kanan karqa.
And he was angry, very angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kasqa, ancha phiñasqa.
It’s not a good place to do that.	Chaypaqqa manam allinchu.
He’s who you want to be with.	Payqa pichus qanwan kayta munanki.
It doesn’t matter if it’s hidden or not.	Pakasqa kaptinpas mana kaptinpas manam imananpaschu.
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Ichapas mana ruwananchu.
He seemed nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
I know he is married.	Yachanim casarasqa kasqanmanta.
Now they both look the same.	Kunanqa iskayninkum huk rikchayniyuq kanku.
He wanted nothing to do with me.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu ñoqawanqa.
But then there was a problem.	Ichaqa chaymantam huk sasachakuy karqa.
This guy is so great.	Kay runaqa ancha hatunmi.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwan.
I’m a big guy.	Hatunmi kani.
But after my time.	Ichaqa tiempoy qhepamanmi.
He was no longer a child.	Payqa manañam wawa hinachu karqa.
He couldn't believe what was happening.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
Just do it right away.	Chaylla ruway.
Would it be nice if you .	Allinchu kanman sichus qan .
Worse, he was depressed.	Aswan mana allinqa, payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
Maybe a month or two.	Ichapas huk iskay killa.
I know there are more.	Yachanim aswan achka kasqanmanta.
We’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqayku.
He really has to do it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanan.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Ichapas chaymanta imatapas yachan.
It’s the best thing ever.	Aswan allin kaqmi.
I think it will be good.	Allinmi kanqa nispam piensani.
I knew this was it.	Yacharqanim kay kasqanmanta.
She couldn't remember the last time she'd been so excited.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu qhepa kutipi chhayna kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
And this is the point here.	Hinaspa kaymi kaypiqa.
He said it would never happen again.	Payqa nirqanmi manaña hukmanta chayna kananta.
This is obviously nothing of the sort.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana imapas chay hinachu.
I feel like crazy.	Loco hinam tarikuni.
Now it’s not.	Kunanqa manañam.
Therefore, it is not a good thing.	Chayraykum mana allinchu.
I don’t feel too tired this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi mana anchatachu sayk’usqa tarikuni.
He immediately got into trouble.	Chayllam chay sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Where is he now.	Maypi kunan kachkan.
I don't really think so.	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa piensani.
Some of what he said was nice on the surface.	Wakin nisqanqa sumaqmi karqan hawapi.
It seemed a very long time ago.	Ancha unayñam rikchakurqa.
Which is hard, man.	Imataq sinchi, runa.
He pretty much stopped coming.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim hamuyta saqirqa.
I don’t know who he is.	Manam yachanichu pi kasqanmanta.
Yes they are.	Arí paykunaqa kanku.
He said that it was not.	Manam chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
But if that’s the case.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinqa.
He couldn’t and wouldn’t say anything about that.	Chaymantaqa manan imatapas niyta atirqanchu nitaq niyta atinmanchu.
They were angry.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
Tell me what you mean.	Willay ima niyta munasqaykita.
Maybe there were more.	Ichapas aswan achka karqaku.
The first afternoon.	Ñawpaq tarde.
He did a very good job.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
I am so proud of him.	Anchatam orgulloso kani paymanta.
No idea how that happened.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu imaynatachus chay pasasqanmanta.
I think it just has to be here.	Yuyaykuni chaylla kaypi kananta.
He wasn’t the best.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
I hear it’s great.	Uyarini ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Me, this is me.	Ñuqa, kayqa ñuqam kani.
Not really even sure what.	Mana chiqaptachu nitaq seguro imamanta.
He desperately wanted to leave, but he couldn’t.	Payqa sinchitan ripuyta munarqan, ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I can’t see it.	Manam rikuyta atinichu.
It was the best time ever.	Chayqa aswan allin tiempon karqan.
Clearly something is wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allinchu kashan.
They are good there.	Chaypiqa allinmi kanku.
That’s not going to happen.	Chayqa manan kanqachu.
But it doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan allin ruwaychu rikch’akun.
No one does it that often.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu chhayna sapa kutilla.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Manam chaywanqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanichu.
He said, it’s you.	Payqa nisqa, qanmi.
I’m really a guy.	Cheqaqtapunin kani.
I hope that's not true.	Suyachkani chayna mana chiqap kananpaq.
There will be a black cup of coffee.	Huk yana kukata kanqa.
But that wasn’t good enough for him.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu karqan paypaq.
If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
It’s just not really good at all.	Chaylla mana chiqap allinchu ni imapipas.
We used to do that.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaytan ruwaq kayku.
You’re mine, you’re mine.	Qamqa ñuqapa kanki.
He says he needs money.	Qullqita necesitasqanmanta nin.
Therein lies the truth.	Chaypin cheqaq kaq kashan.
But it's after today.	Ichaqa kunan p'unchay qhepamanmi.
He hadn't agreed to anything yet.	Payqa manaraqmi imatapas acuerdopichu kasqa.
That doesn’t really mean anything.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas niyta munan.
So it’s very serious.	Chaymi ancha serio.
What is?.	¿Imataq?.
He really has no choice.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa manan huk ruwayta atinchu.
It’s such a good thing.	Chayna allin kaqmi.
I can’t imagine it that way.	Manam chaynataqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I was better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi karqani.
That’s obviously the truth.	Chayqa sut’inmi cheqaq kaq.
The next week I saw him again.	Qatiqnin semanan hukmanta rikurqani.
It’s not the easiest.	Manam aswan facilchu.
He was serious about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta serio karqa.
That was a long time ago though.	Chayqa unayñan ichaqa karqan.
Here he was, he was.	Kaypim payqa karqa.
I know how busy you are.	Yachanim imayna ocupasqa kasqaykita.
I'm not sure what's wrong with this.	Manam segurochu kani kaypi ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
And then he did it again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta ruwarqa.
Please do help.	Ama hina kaspa, yanapayta ruway.
I don't do that much.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu ruwani.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutim kan.
He couldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
You can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiwaqchu.
It certainly would be.	Cheqaqtapunin chayna kanman.
So, that’s true.	Chaymi, chayna chiqap.
This will be more difficult.	Kayqa aswan sasa kanqa.
I’m really, really sorry.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta llakikuni.
He never did anything right.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas allintachu ruwarqan.
Follow the instructions.	Chay nisqanman hina ruway.
Instead, he celebrates it with me.	Aswanpas chaytaqa ñoqawan kuskan fiestata ruwan.
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa unayñan karqan.
Good morning everyone.	Allin p'unchaw llapa runa.
I was immediately in trouble.	Chayllam sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
We’re not very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu chaypiqa kanchik.
Home as early as possible every night.	Wasiman sapa tuta atisqanman hina temprano.
He was not a great man.	Payqa manam hatun runachu karqa.
He knows that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yachan.
Maybe he’s the one.	Ichapas payqa.
That’s a dozen.	Chayqa huk chunka.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?	¿Imaynataq paqarin pacha kanqa?
A stranger, but a nice man.	Mana riqsisqa runa, ichaqa sumaq runa.
Learn about this.	Kaymanta yachay.
And if nothing else.	Hinaspa mana imapas kaptinqa.
Everyone has something.	Lliwmi imapas kan.
That means you can do anything.	Chayqa niyta munan imatapas ruwayta atisqaykita.
He didn’t want to hold her here against her will.	Payqa manan kaypi hap’iyta munarqanchu mana munasqanmanta.
You don’t know what they are like.	Manan yachankichu imayna kasqankuta.
He had to do this job.	Payqa kay llamk’ayta ruwanan karqa.
Where you have no idea at all.	Maypichus mana ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki ni imapipas.
The people were very happy.	Chay runakunaqa ancha kusisqam karqaku.
That was not ideal on a summer morning.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan chiri tiempopi paqarin.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa.
So I was surprised.	Chaymi admirakurqani.
If anything there was actually food there, anyway.	Sichus imapas chiqap chaypi mikhuy karqa, imayna kaptinpas.
Very he really.	Ancha pay chiqap.
Everything was there.	Tukuy imapas chaypi kasqa.
He wants to play.	Payqa pukllayta munan.
The process is very easy for a child to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi huk wawa ruwayta atin.
It was very cold last night.	Qayna tutam ancha chiri karqa.
He knew what was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus pasananta.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manam allinchu kanman.
Do what you have to do.	Ruwanaykita ruway.
Well placed.	Allin churasqa.
It was all mine.	Lliwmi ñuqapa karqa.
Tell me what you want to do.	Willaway ima ruway munasqaykita.
I really need it.	Chiqaptam necesitasaq.
He’s a lucky guy.	Payqa suerteyoqmi.
He says it’s easy to do.	Payqa ninmi chay ruwayqa facilmi nispa.
He wants to do it again.	Yapamanta ruwayta munan.
I was with someone.	Piwanpas karqani.
Now, maybe, he’d do it again.	Kunanqa, ichapas, yapamanta chayta ruwanman.
And being there.	Hinaspa chaypi kaspa.
He wasn’t sure it would be okay.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa allin kananta.
Unfortunately, it was not meant to be.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
Explain why you say so.	Willay imarayku nisqaykita.
He was a man now.	Payqa kunanmi runa kasqa.
Sure enough, one day he told me to do something.	Seguro, huk punchawmi niwarqa imatapas ruwanaypaq.
He’s not good enough yet, for that matter.	Payqa manaraqmi allinchu, chaypaqqa.
I seemed surprised.	Admirasqa hinam karqani.
I was there this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi chaypi karqani.
They are not like you.	Paykunaqa manan qan hinachu kanku.
They have been a couple for a long time now.	Paykunaqa unayñan huk casarasqa kanku kunanqa.
It won’t be that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kanqa.
One knows better.	Hukninmi aswan allinta yachan.
He said he had never been there.	Payqa nirqam mana haykapipas chayman risqanmanta.
Not a great guy.	Mana hatun runachu.
He was happy, then happy.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa, chaymanta kusisqa kasqa.
It was like everything else.	Tukuy imapas hinam karqa.
I feel comfortable in it now.	Kunanqa allintam chaypi tarikuni.
Maybe that’s how they were happy together.	Ichapas chaynata kuska kusisqa karqaku.
He was cold, very cold.	Payqa chiri, ancha chiri kasqa.
It’s not good about that.	Mana allinchu chaymantaqa.
He is a serious man.	Payqa serio runam.
She knew he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi payqa yachasqanmanta.
I was pretty sure that would happen.	Chayqa allintam seguro karqani chayna kananta.
I was so happy to be able to help her.	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani payta yanapayta atisqaymanta.
I'm listening.	Uyarini.
Now it has to be the right thing to do.	Kunanqa allin ruwaymi kanan.
He won’t do that to her.	Chaytaqa manan paytaqa ruwanqachu.
He didn’t notice her.	Payqa manan paytaqa repararqanchu.
No more people.	Manaña runakuna.
Good evening, he said.	Allin chisi, nispas nisqa.
This may not be a good idea.	Kayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
All the way through.	Tukuy ñanta.
I am, in fact, neither here nor there.	Ñuqaqa, chiqaptaqa, manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kani.

I’ve actually heard that before.	Chiqamanta chayta ñawpaqta uyarirqani.
I am very sorry.'	Anchatan llakikuni’, nispa.
There was someone.	Pipas karqa.
The people of the city seemed happy.	Chay llaqtapi runakunaqa kusisqa hinam karqaku.

Two days now.	Kunanqa iskay punchaw.
All right, baby, all right .	Allinmi, wawa, allinmi .

I saw him yesterday morning.	Qayna paqarinmi payta rikurqani.
Tell me how that is prioritized.	Willaway imaynatas chay ñawpaqpi churasqa kashan chayta.
I’m not quite ready.	Manam allintachu listo kachkani.
I agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kani.
I can’t imagine what he would do about it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu chaymanta ima ruwananta.
That is not true at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas cheqaqchu.
He can barely walk.	Yaqapaschá puriyta atin.
I’m sorry the world is cruel.	Pampachaykuway kay pacha millay kasqanmanta.
I can’t hear this stuff.	Manam kay imakunatapas uyariyta atinichu.
They are eager to do so.	Paykunaqa anchatam munanku chayta ruwayta.
That means it is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam niyta munan.
Something about this didn't seem right.	Kaymanta imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I know it's about him.	Yachanim paymanta kasqanmanta.
He was a happy man.	Payqa kusisqa runam karqa.
A singular act.	Huk sapallan ruway.
Tell me that again.	Chayta yapamanta willaway.
And you know it’s no problem.	Hinaspa yachanki mana sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
One day at that time.	Huk punchaw chay pacha.
But no one ever noticed.	Ichaqa manan pipas hayk’aqpas repararqanchu.
So it’s better, maybe.	Chaymi aswan allinqa, ichapas.
I did this wrong.	Kaytaqa mana allintam ruwarqani.
I wanted to know everything.	Tukuy imatam yachayta munarqani.
It’s never happened before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
No more than that.	Mana aswan chaymantaqa.
Everyone knows you exist.	Lliwmi yachanku kasqaykita.
Still, he kept going.	Chayna kaptinpas, payqa hinallam nirqa.
So he stayed behind.	Chaymi payqa qhepakurqan.
I am as good as you are.	Ñoqapas qan hina allinmi kani.
I’m really looking forward to playing.	Chiqamanta pukllayta suyachkani.
Now he wanted to get home.	Kunanqa wasinman chayayta munarqa.
So you have to do it right.	Chaymi allinta ruwanayki.
They were there now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi chaypi karqaku.
I was better than I was.	Ñoqaqa aswan allinmi karqan.
That’s okay, with that.	Chayqa allinmi, chaywan.
That is no longer the case today.	Kunanqa manañan chayqa kanchu.
He lives alone.	Payqa sapallanmi tiyan.
He wouldn’t agree with that.	Payqa manan chaywanqa acuerdopichu kanman.
But things were not as they used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu imapas karqan.

Do you always know the right answer?	¿Sapa kutichu yachanki allin kutichiyta?

All this time.	Tukuy kay pacha.
But no one can do that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
Being serious all the time wasn't enough.	Tukuy tiempo serio kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
I've never seen anyone with that.	Manam haykapipas pitapas chaywanqa rikurqanichu.
The best thing to do is to do something about it.	Aswan allinqa chaymanta imatapas ruwaymi.
You said something this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi imatapas nirqanki.
There was something there with me.	Chaypin imapas karqan ñoqawan.
There is a lot to do.	Achka ruwana kachkan.
He wouldn't want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munanmanchu karqan.

I wonder if this is a good thing.	Kayqa allinchu icha manachu chayta tapukuni.
If it’s here, that’s fine.	Sichus kaypi kashan chayqa, allinmi.
I’m so excited.	Anchatan kusikuni.
He's probably busy.	Payqa yaqapaschá ocupasqa kashan.
You just keep doing it there.	Qamqa chaypi hinallam ruwanki.
This, however, is in and of itself.	Kaymi ichaqa tukuy imapipas, tukuy imamantapas.
This was supposed to be easy.	Kayqa facilmi kanan karqa.
He still tried to work it out.	Payqa hinallam chayta allichayta munarqa.
He was fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kasqa.
The man is so great!	¡Chay runaqa ancha hatunmi!
And that’s a beautiful thing.	Hinaspa chayqa sumaqmi.

He wanted to do everything she wanted, but with him.	Payqa tukuy ima munasqanta ruwayta munarqa, ichaqa paywan.
Yes, you are really in trouble.	Arí, chiqaptam sasachakuypi kachkanki.
This should be done regularly.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwananchik.

He did what he had to do.	Payqa imatachus ruwana kasqanta ruwarqa.
But we are human beings.	Ichaqa runam kanchik.
But I doubt I can do this.	Ichaqa iskayrayani kayta ruway atisqaymanta.
That’s just the way it is.	Chayqa chayllaraqmi kachkan.
In doing this, he checked for injury.	Kayta ruwaspaqa, k’irisqa kasqanmanta qhawarisqa.
He can’t stay.	Payqa manan qhepakuyta atinchu.

Something is wrong, you know.	Imapas mana allinchu kachkan, yachanki.

He certainly did, and he did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan, chaymi ruwarqan.
This was going to be his.	Kayqa paypaq kanan karqa.
That won’t happen here.	Chayqa mana kaypi kanqachu.
There isn’t	Mana kanchu
Bigger and bigger.	Aswan hatun hinaspa aswan hatun.
We played, we played, we played.	Pukllaq kayku, pukllaq kayku, pukllaq kayku.
I wouldn’t be very good.	Manam ancha allinchu kayman.
I couldn’t figure that out.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I'm fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kachkani.
He’s afraid to be safe.	Payqa manchakunmi seguro kananpaq.
But it was a better thing to do.	Ichaqa aswan allin ruwaymi karqan.
I would love to see something like this every week.	Anchatan munani sapa semana kay hinata rikuyta.
That almost seemed like it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá rikchakurqa.
It's okay to be tired.	Sayk'usqa kayqa allinmi.
Second, the objects.	Iskay kaq, imakuna.
That’s right how you do it.	Chayqa allinmi imaynatataq ruwanki.
Well, what were you supposed to do? 	Allinmi, ¿imatam ruwanayki karqa?
So, you’re the one.	Chaymi, qamqa kanki.
Less is really more.	Aswan pisi chiqamanta aswan.
Maybe then he is.	Ichapas chaymantaqa payqa kanman.
I’ve always been a problem child.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi sasachakuy wawa karqani.
I can’t say he was happy about it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu chaymanta kusisqa kasqanmantaqa.
He was alone in school.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa escuelapi.
That would be easy.	Chayna kaptinqa facilmi kanman.
But perhaps that was not true.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa mana cheqaqchu karqan.
I wanted to leave.	Ripuyta munarqani.
But you knew that.	Ichaqa chaytan yacharqanki.
Maybe they were both true.	Ichapas iskayninku chiqap karqaku.
Home again, home again.	Wasi yapamanta, wasi yapamanta.
I didn’t really want to.	Manam chiqaptachu munarqani.
So far, it’s very popular.	Kunankamaqa, ancha riqsisqa.
I don't know when you'll be here.	Mana yachanichu haykapi kaypi kanki.
Obviously you want something from me.	Sut’inmi ñoqamanta imatapas munanki.
I don't know if this will be a problem.	Mana yachanichu kay sasachakuy kanqachu icha manachu chayta.
He was gone most of the day.	Payqa yaqa llapan punchawmi mana chaypichu karqa.
I probably knew it.	Yaqapaschá yacharqani.
But it’s in the city.	Ichaqa llaqtapin kashan.
I can't find it anywhere.	Mana maypipas tariyta atinichu.
He was angry, but he said nothing.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan, ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
More people, more food, coming for him.	Aswan runakuna, aswan mikhuy, paypaq hamuq.
Not sure what this means so what could it mean.	Mana segurochu ima niyta munan kay chaymi ima niyta atinman.
He looked like he was.	Payqa rikchakurqa.
What can I do about it.	Imatataq ruwayman.
I mean, really, really bad.	Niyta munani, chiqap, chiqap mana allin.
Then he got angry.	Chaymanta phiñasqa.
Most people want every new year to be better.	Yaqa llapan runakunam munanku sapa musuq wata aswan allin kananta.
First, he focused on the world.	Ñawpaqtaqa, kay pachapi astawan yuyaykurqan.
He wanted it wrong.	Payqa mana allintam munarqa.
That was a big thing for me.	Chayqa hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
Here, however, is the.	Kaypim ichaqa, chay...
And they’re good.	Hinaspa allin kanku.
He didn’t say it would be.	Manam chayna kananta nirqa.
It’s other people.	Huk runakunam.
I’m not really sure of anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imamantapas segurochu kani.
It’s never been.	Manam haykapipas.
Then along one went	Chaymanta kuska huk rirqa
He needs some time.	Payqa huk tiempotan necesitan.
He is not like the old man.	Payqa manan ñawpaq runa hinachu.
I don’t know who they are.	Manam yachanichu pikuna kasqankuta.
It looked new.	Musuq rikchakurqa.
He’s the first person to do it right.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq runa allinta ruwananpaq.
You are right in trouble.	Qamqa allintam sasachakuypi kachkanki.
I think you know.	Yuyaykuni yachasqaykita.
I tried very hard.	Anchatam kallpanchakurqani.
That’s what I do.	Chayta ruwani.
They mean you are sick.	Paykunaqa unqusqa kasqaykita niyta munan.
I know that’s the case.	Chayta yachani.
What it should be like.	Imaynataq kanan tiyan.
But he’s a little nervous.	Ichaqa huk chhikantan mancharisqa kashan.
I would have done the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwayman karqa.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan munasqanmanta.
He had no idea what was going on.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
They were wonderful people.	Paykunaqa sumaq runakunam karqaku.
Everything seems strange.	Tukuy imapas mana riqsisqa hinam rikchakun.
I was very impressed.	Sinchitan admirakurqani.
I’m just happy.	Chaylla kusikuni.
I mean it’s for me.	Niyta munani ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
I think that is the problem.	Chayqa chay sasachakuy kasqanmantam piensani.
He certainly did well.	Cheqaqtapunin allinta ruwarqan.
But it was easy to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa facilmi karqan.
He did not say why.	Payqa manan nirqanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
If not, let me know.	Mana chayqa, willaway.
They want it to be difficult.	Paykunaqa munanku sasa kananta.
So, no big deal.	Chaymi, mana hatun ruwaychu.
No one knew what had happened.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
But the reality could be worse.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi aswan mana allin kanman.
That’s never going to work.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
It was a big deal at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
I didn’t think this would be pretty.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay sumaq kananta.
I immediately know what he means.	Chayllam yachani ima nisqanmanta.
But in a new way.	Ichaqa huk mosoq hina.
This is a much bigger one.	Kayqa aswan hatunmi.
And that was stupid.	Hinaspa chayqa sonso kaymi karqan.
Yes, they are fine.	Arí, allinmi kachkanku.
The role was a huge one for him.	Chay ruwayqa ancha hatunmi karqan paypaq.
He was really here.	Payqa chiqaptam kaypi karqa.
The coffee is very cold.	Chay kukata ancha chiri.
I don't know what's better.	Manam yachanichu ima aswan allin kasqanmantaqa.
He wants it to be good for him.	Payqa munanmi paypaq allin kananpaq.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t do that.	Mana chayqa, manan chayta ruwanmanchu.
I am currently looking for a job.	Kunanqa llamkayta maskachkani.
I want to be real.	Chiqap kaytam munani.
Are you ready to go?	¿Listochu kachkanki?
I can’t do it either.	Ñuqapas manam atiymanchu.
And go for it.	Hinaspa riy.
What did he mean by that.	Imatataq niyta munarqa.
You said it before.	Ñawpaqta nirqanki.
This statement makes no sense.	Kay nisqanqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
If there is, that’s fine.	Sichus kan chayqa, allinmi.
He is from the beginning.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Now I knew I was getting there.	Kunanqa yacharqanim chayman chayayta.
So tell me a bit about yourself.	Chaymi qanmanta huk chhikanta willaway.
And tell me so.	Hinaspa chaynata willaway.
He was right, every time.	Payqa allintam nirqa, sapa kuti.
There wasn’t much time.	Manam ancha tiempo karqachu.
It’s not a good thing to talk about.	Manam allinchu rimayqa.
Funny, for sure.	Asikunapaq hina, seguro.
They were wrong.	Paykunaqa pantasqa karqanku.
Bigger than you are.	Qammanta aswan hatun.
The people are great.	Runakunaqa hatunmi.
It would be great again.	Yapamanta hatunmi kanman.
But anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas.
I had an inkling that something was wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam huk yuyayniyuq karqani.
Same here.	Kikin kaypi.
He wanted to catch it.	Hap’iyta munarqa.
I know you want it with me.	Yachanim ñuqawan munasqaykita.
This is the thing.	Kaymi imapas.
It doesn’t mean that.	Manam chaytachu niyta munan.
Who are you?	¿Pitaq kanki?
He was happy to go with her.	Payqa kusisqam paywan rirqa.
Or two weeks.	Utaq iskay semana.
The first year is harder.	Ñawpaq wata aswan sasa.
They’re not good enough.	Manam allinchu kanku.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
That is not the case today.	Chayqa manan kunan tiempopi hinachu.
I don’t know the third way.	Manam yachanichu kimsa kaq ñanta.
The sick person.	Unqusqa runa.
I didn't think it was any worse.	Manam piensarqanichu aswan mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
You can do that one day.	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi ruwawaq.
He said stop being stupid.	Payqa nirqanmi amaña sonso kayta.
What do you think will happen next?	¿Imataq chaymanta pasananta yuyanki?
I mean, they are, but then for me.	Niyta munani, paykunaqa kanku, ichaqa chaymanta ñuqapaq.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Manam yachanichu ima ruwanayta, chiqaptaqa.
That’s not true here.	Chayqa manan kaypiqa cheqaqchu.
If the latter, you do.	Kay qhipa kaq kaptinqa, qamqa ruwanki.
He seems very happy now.	Payqa kunanqa ancha kusisqa hinam kachkan.
But it didn’t come as he did.	Ichaqa manan pay hinachu hamurqan.
Easy, right?	Facil, ¿aw?
Now he knew it wasn't.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
That makes the ride even more interesting.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi chay puriyta.
I’ll probably do it.	Yaqapaschá ruwasaq.
It looked amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
Which was really nice.	Imataq chiqap sumaq karqa.
He was such a genuine person.	Payqa chayna chiqap runam karqa.
I couldn’t hear it.	Manam uyariyta atirqanichu.
Please tell me the answer.	Ama hina kaspa, kutichiyta willaway.
Or tomorrow night.	Utaq paqarin tuta.
It’s not good or bad, that’s all there is to it.	Mana allinchu nitaq mana allinchu, chaylla kachkan.
That’s a good thing,’ he says.	Chayqa allinmi’, nispas nin.
I know he has no idea.	Yachanim mana ima yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
Tell the truth.	Cheqaqtapuni willay.
Maybe I'm doing this wrong.	Ichapas kayta mana allinta ruwachkani.
Go make another one.	Hukta ruwanaykipaq riy.
He was happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kasharqan.
That wouldn’t be right.	Chay nisqanqa manan allinchu kanman.
Something is wrong there.	Chaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
The most confusing.	Aswan pantasqa.
but he cannot do so well.	ichaqa manan allintachu chaytaqa ruwayta atin.
I wish it was a little less though.	Munaymanmi chay pisi aswan pisi ichaqa.
She knew she couldn't hold out much longer.	Payqa yacharqanmi manaña aswan unaytachu aguantayta atisqanmanta.
I like to talk about anything.	Imamantapas rimayta allintam munani.

There is nothing like a house	Wasi hinaqa manam kanchu
You never know!.	¡Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu!.
Many times.	Achka kuti.
I know you can do this.	Yachanim kayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
About a month ago.	Yaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He didn’t know but he thought he would.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ichaqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananta.
Who is he, anyway? 	¿Pitaq payqa?
You don’t want to talk.	Manam rimayta munankichu.
Now he was really in trouble.	Kunanqa chiqaptam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
That doesn’t sound very sure.	Chayqa manan ancha segurochu uyarikun.
We can’t fix everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas allichayta atichwanchu.
I didn’t know you were.	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqaykita.
That’s where you think and do what’s right.	Chaypin yuyaykunki, imachus allin kaqta ruwanki.
And maybe the good thing about it.	Hinaspa ichapas chaypi allin kaq.
He wanted to sleep late but couldn’t.	Payqa tardeta puñuyta munarqan ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I don't understand it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam entiendenichu.
And that’s difficult.	Hinaspa chayqa sasa.
You know if it's.	Yachankim sichus.
There is no one here.	Kaypiqa manam pitapas kanchu.
I’m not quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
A well-known university	Allin riqsisqa hatun yachay wasi
Perhaps no one noticed.	Manapaschá pipas repararqanchu.
An easy day.	Huk facil punchaw.
But there was one thing he had to do first.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi ñawpaqtaqa ruwanan karqan.
I don't know how he did it.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam chayta ruwarqa.
You can’t, you can’t.	Manan atiwaqchu, manan atiwaqchu.
I could not answer them.	Chaykunataqa manam kutichiyta atirqanichu.
That’s all I wanted to say.	Chaylla niyta munarqani.
I'd like to hear it.	Munaymanmi uyariyta.
Otherwise, it would have been amazing.	Mana chayna kaptinqa admirakuypaqmi kanman karqa.
It’s pretty nice.	Allin sumaqmi.
I'm not sure it ever will be.	Manam segurochu kani haykapipas kananmanta.
I knew it would happen.	Yacharqanim chayna pasananta.
You’re probably really busy.	Yaqapaschá cheqaqtapuni ocupasqa kanki.
We can’t know.	Manam yachayta atichwanchu.
You here a lot.	Qam kaypi achkata.
And then a year, it happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk wata, chayna pasarqa.
It went quickly.	Chayqa utqayllam rirqa.
They were pretty dark.	Paykunaqa sumaq yana karqanku.
He wasn’t as happy as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu kusisqa karqan.
I don’t know what, but it’s bad.	Manam yachanichu ima, ichaqa mana allinmi.
I never find it.	Manam haykapipas tarinichu.
No one can do this for you.	Manan pipas kaytaqa qanpaq ruwayta atinmanchu.
He can’t sit still.	Manam tiyayta atinchu.
More on that here.	Chaymanta astawan kaypi.
I don’t want to talk to you.	Manam qamwan rimayta munanichu.
No, not really.	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
He wanted to be famous.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa kaytam anchata munarqa.
So it happened to him.	Chaymi paywan pasarqa.
It’s not anymore.	Manañam.
Someone knows everything.	Pipas tukuy imamanta yachan.
I didn’t want to be out there.	Manam chay hawapi kayta munarqanichu.
Yes, this is difficult.	Arí, kayqa sasam.
Not like you.	Mana qam hinachu.
They were nervous and excited.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, kusisqa ima karqanku.
Eventually it happened.	Qhepamanmi chay hina karqan.
They were here for something.	Paykunaqa imapaqpas kaypi karqanku.
They want it and they yearn for it.	Chaytaqa munanku hinaspa anchata munanku.
No, he couldn’t.	Manan, payqa manan atirqanchu.
Nothing is that difficult.	Manam imapas chayna sasachu.
That’s a good thing.	Chayqa allintam.
He was, after all, very busy.	Payqa, tukuy imamanta, ancha ocupasqa karqa.
I wasn’t good enough.	Manam allinchu karqani.
She is a beautiful young woman.	Payqa sumaq sipasmi.
I don't think it will happen.	Manam piensanichu chayna kananta.
Better to act quickly.	Aswan allinmi usqhaylla ruway.
He couldn't stop it.	Mana hark'ayta atirqanchu.
This is a good statement.	Kay rimayqa allinmi.
I'm sure it happened.	Seguro kani chay pasasqanmanta.
What would be the best thing?.	¿Imataq aswan allin kanman?.
Something is really wrong.	Chiqaptam imapas mana allinchu.
He does evil well.	Payqa mana allintam allinta ruwan.
I think you’ll be really happy.	Yuyaykuni chiqaptapuni kusisqa kanki.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Manam yachanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
This is what he wanted.	Kaytam payqa munarqa.
I have felt that way many times.	Achka kutitam chaynata hina tarikurqani.
I feel sorry for him.	Paymanta llakikuni.
We are not like these people.	Manam kay runakuna hinachu kanchik.
A little bit at a time.	Huk chhikanta huk kutipi.
It will never be better than this.	Manam haykapipas kaymantaqa aswan allinqa kanqachu.
Very good, and very tasty food.	Ancha allin, hinaspa ancha sumaq mikhuy.
I didn’t want to sit down.	Manam tiyayta munarqanichu.
I can’t remember what it was.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu ima kasqanmanta.
I can’t say anymore.	Manañam niyta atiymanchu.
Which is stupid.	Imataq sonso.
I'm doing pretty good.	Allin allintam ruwachkani.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
I’m really looking forward to that.	Chiqamanta chayta suyachkani.
Now that’s great!.	Kunanqa chayqa ancha allinmi!.
What was the truth? 	¿Imataq chiqap karqa?
Yes, he did notice.	Arí, payqa repararqanmi.
It still makes no sense.	Kunankamapas manam imapaqpas valenchu.
It’s better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
Okay, maybe two.	Allinmi, ichapas iskay.
I don't understand why.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
You can’t do it.	Manan atiwaqchu.
It’s about who he is.	Chayqa pi kasqanmantam.
I am so sorry about how hard it was.	Anchatam llakikuni imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
This is a regular practice.	Kayqa sapa kuti ruwaymi.
But it doesn’t matter why.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu imarayku chay ruwasqanqa.
He certainly knew better than that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaymanta aswan allinta yacharqan.
But really good people.	Ichaqa chiqap allin runakuna.
I was right ten times.	Chunka kutitam allinta nirqani.
This can’t be easy.	Kayqa manan facilchu kanman.
I’m not really like that.	Manam chiqaptachu chayna kani.
He is always doing too much.	Payqa sapa kutim llumpayta ruwachkan.
No one could remember having one.	Manam pipas yuyariyta atirqachu huknin kasqanmantaqa.
I did something right.	Imatapas allintam ruwarqani.
He was the bad guy.	Payqa mana allin kaqmi karqan.
It’s a pity!.	¡Llakikuypaqmi!.
It’s good to know, to be together like that.	Allinmi yachay, chay hinata kuska kay.
Anyway, that's it for now.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymi kunankamaqa.
He was there for a while.	Chaypim huk tiempo karqa.
Someone would like to work with you.	Pipas qamwan llamkayta munanman.
Maybe that’s true.	Ichapas chayqa chiqap kanman.
There he had her.	Chaypim paytaqa karqa.
I want this way.	Kay ñanta munani.
This was something new.	Kayqa musuq kaqmi karqa.
I want to be a new me.	Musuq ñuqa kaytam munani.
He wasn’t happy for long.	Mana unaytachu kusisqa kasqa.
He couldn’t do it anymore.	Payqa manañan atirqanchu.
He eats constantly throughout the day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi sapa kutilla mikun.
Eat a healthy diet.	Allin mikhunata mikhuy.
That’s certainly not the only thing that matters.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana chayllachu ancha importante.
But a funny thing happened.	Ichaqa huk asikunapaq hina kaqmi pasarqa.
But it’s not there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu kashan.
But for now.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa.
It seemed very familiar.	Chayqa ancha riqsisqa hinam karqa.
To anyone, to anyone.	Pimanpas, pimanpas.
He wants to know.	Payqa yachayta munan.
I didn’t know what to make of him.	Manam yacharqanichu paymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
It doesn’t sound familiar.	Manam riqsisqa hinachu uyarikun.
Was something wrong? 	¿Imapas mana allinchu karqa?
Nothing like that, ever.	Mana imapas chayna, haykapipas.
He wanted to win.	Munarqa atipayta.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Payqa manan chay hina runachu karqan.
I still don't understand why.	Kunankamapas manam entiendenichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He made an effort.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi.
I would rather do one thing at a time.	Aswan allinmi kanman hukta hukmanta ruwayqa.
We are not here for half a day.	Manam kuskan punchawchu kaypi kachkaniku.
I don’t think you do.	Manam yuyanichu chayta ruwasqaykita.
It doesn’t sound like it.	Manan chay hinachu uyarikun.
You can do two things.	Iskay ruwaykunata ruwawaq.
I don’t know what’s wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima millay kasqanmanta.
This may not yet be all-inclusive.	Kayqa manaraqmi tukuy imapaqpas allinchu kanman.
He is good for you.	Payqa allinmi qampaq.
I know that sounds rather crazy.	Yachanim chayqa aswan loco hina uyarikun.
But now he can tell.	Ichaqa kunanmi willayta atinman.
He may not do this.	Kaytaqa manapaschá ruwanmanchu.
I’m in the position.	Ñuqaqa kachkani.
This would be better.	Kayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
It doesn’t mean anything, really.	Manam imatapas niyta munanchu, chiqaptaqa.
They are like everyone else.	Paykunaqa llapa runakuna hinam kanku.
He did a great job of this last night.	Payqa qayna tutam kaymanta hatun llamkayta ruwarqa.
He had been there before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi kasqa.
And here I am now.	Hinaspa kaypi kunan kachkani.
I don't really know what that is about.	Manam anchatachu yachani imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
I treat it like a child.	Wawa hinam hapini.
It was almost amazing.	Yaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
This has happened before.	Kayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
I couldn't do it anymore, I couldn't stand it like that.	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu, manam chaynata aguantayta atirqanichu.
This still sounds overly important though.	Kayqa hinallam uyarikun llumpay importante ichaqa.
It’s beautiful.	Sumaqmi.
I saw everything.	Tukuy imatam rikurqani.
It was hard to say why he thought that was the case.	Sasam karqa imanasqa chayna kananpaq piensasqanmanta rimayqa.
So you did well today.	Chaynatam kunan punchaw allinta ruwarqanki.
He looked very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
Learn to sing.	Takiyta yachay.
I couldn’t go.	Manam riyta atirqanichu.
I knew how many months had passed.	Yacharqanim hayka killa pasasqanmanta.
I'm really tired.	Chiqaptam sayk'usqa kachkani.
If it doesn’t exist, do it.	Mana kanchu chayqa, ruway.
I actually didn’t do that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
Everybody wants everybody wants to be mindful.	Tukuy runa munanku tukuy runa munanku yuyayniyuq kayta.
He opened the book.	Chay librota kicharirqa.
The coffee was too dark.	Chay kukata llumpay yana kasqa.
It meant a lot.	Achkatam niyta munarqa.
Then he was expelled.	Chaymanta qarqusqa.
This is no big deal.	Kayqa manam hatun ruwaychu.
He lives here.	Payqa kaypim tiyan.
He wasn’t really human.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu runa karqan.
He didn’t say anything else.	Payqa manañan nirqanchu.
Maybe I am.	Ichapas kani.
Or he’s the one.	Utaq pay.
Again, doing a lot.	Yapamanta, achkata ruwaspa.
The older one, however.	Chay aswan kuraq kaqmi ichaqa.
He could not walk without one.	Mana huknin kaptinqa manam puriyta atinmanchu karqa.
It just can’t work.	Chaylla mana llamk’ayta atinchu.
It was well hidden.	Allin pakasqa kasqa.
That would be easy.	Chayqa facilmi kanman.
One of them was twenty.	Hukninmi karqa iskay chunka.
He was in the hospital all day.	Tukuy punchawmi hospitalpi karqa.
I really hope this is true.	Chiqaptam suyachkani kayqa chiqap kananpaq.
When he is sad, he is usually right.	Llakisqa kaptinqa yaqa llapanpim allinta rimachkan.
It’s not, it’s not.	Manam mana.
Tell me how it happened.	Imayna pasasqanmanta willaway.
But he didn’t want to know for sure.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachayta munarqan.
I don’t want that person to be involved in anything.	Manam munanichu chay runa imapipas chaypi kananta.
He had been in the hospital for a long time.	Payqa unayñan hospitalpi kasharqan.
She said she was a little nervous.	Payqa huk chhikanta mancharisqa kashasqanmantan nirqan.
Perhaps the best performance of the night.	Ichapas chay tutamanta aswan allin ruway.
But he couldn’t hear it.	Ichaqa manan uyariyta atirqanchu.
He couldn’t do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
It’s better not to be there.	Aswan allinmi mana chaypi kayqa.
He knew he would never come back here.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayman mana hayk’aqpas kutimunanta.
The man told me not to say anything.	Chay runam niwarqa ama imatapas rimanaypaq.
Everyone, including you.	Tukuy runa, chaymanta qam.
What a beautiful day.	Ima sumaq punchawmi.
I didn’t know you would be here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kanaykita.
Obviously, it makes no sense.	Sut’inmi, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
It could be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanman.
This is an easy and quick process.	Kayqa huk ruwaymi mana sasachu hinaspa utqaylla.
And then no.	Hinaspa chaymanta mana.
The first is this.	Ñawpaq kaqmi kay.
I used to do that.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam ruwaq kani.
They are beautiful, but very large.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi, ichaqa ancha hatunmi.
It was still going on.	Hinallam karqa.
This is the secret.	Kaymi pakasqa.
The first half was quick.	Ñawpaq kaq kuskan usqhaylla karqan.
I did that pretty much all the time, actually.	Chaytaqa yaqa sapa kutim ruwarqani, chiqaptaqa.
He certainly did in the past.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq tiempopi chayta ruwarqan.
I would be very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kayman.
Then there was nothing.	Chaymantaqa mana imapas karqachu.
He obviously doesn’t want to help.	Payqa sut’inmi mana yanapayta munanchu.
He doesn’t do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwanchu.
I think that’s it.	Chayta yuyaykuni.
I don’t feel bad.	Manam mana allintachu sientekuni.
I don’t know why or how this happened.	Mana yachanichu imarayku nitaq imaynatachus kay pasasqanmanta.
That’s going to come.	Chayqa hamunqa.
This morning, indeed.	Kunan paqarin, chiqaptapuni.
It just was a lot.	Chayllaraqmi askha karqan.
Hardly anyone knew where he lived.	Yaqapaschá pipas yacharqanchu maypi tiyasqanmanta.
You’re the one, right?	Qanmi kanki, ¿aw?
He stayed there for a while.	Chaypin huk tiempo qhepakurqan.
I spent most of the night there in the hospital.	Chaypim yaqa llapan tuta hospitalpi karqani.
He has been there for a long time.	Payqa unayñam chaypi kachkan.
Even if it’s bad, even if it’s really bad.	Mana allin kaptinpas, chiqap mana allin kaptinpas.
But he would never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
He knew what had happened to him.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus paywan pasasqanmanta.
You did it a few years ago.	Iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqanki.
That’s why it was so important.	Chayraykum ancha allin karqa.
I guess I can't get hold of it.	Ichapas manam chaymanta hapiyta atinichu.
It doesn’t mean you’re the best at it.	Manam niyta munanchu chaypi aswan allin kasqaykita.
This is of no use in the world.	Kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kay pachapi.
Probably too much.	Yaqapaschá llumpayta.
Maybe you’re a crazy person.	Ichapas huk loco kanki.
You can actually do these things.	Chaykunataqa chiqaptam ruwawaq.
He is an innocent man.	Payqa mana huchayoq runam.
We cannot be sure of anything.	Manam imamantapas seguro kayta atichwanchu.
I've never seen that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
This is not me.	Kayqa manam ñuqachu kani.
I’m here, man.	Kaypi kachkani, runa.
Night sure now.	Tuta seguro kunan.
She was an innocent girl.	Payqa mana huchayoq sipasmi karqan.
Did you know what.	Yacharqankichu imata.
I never thought it was coming.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chay hamunanta.
It was the .	Chayqa karqan chay .
That’s what he didn’t realize.	Chaytan payqa mana repararqanchu.
I think that's something I should do too.	Chayqa ñuqapas ruwanay kasqanmantam piensani.
It will come, if you want it to come.	Hamunqa, hamunanta munaspaqa.
He did as he was told.	Nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
I didn’t want to win.	Manam atipayta munarqanichu.
He knew something was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas mana allin kashasqanmanta.
He didn’t know what a big deal it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta.
I can’t walk anymore.	Manañam puriyta atinichu.
He was angry, so .	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan, chaymi .
The first day was good.	Ñawpaq p’unchawqa allinmi karqan.
I have done this several times.	Kaytaqa achka kutitam ruwarqani.
They want to play this game all the time.	Kay pukllayta tukuy pacha pukllayta munanku.
Without a shape.	Mana rikchayniyuq.
About an hour ago.	Yaqa huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi.
That’s what I was.	Chayqa karqani.
I hope nothing like this ever happens.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas kayna imapas pasananta.
Not sure how good it is.	Mana segurochu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
What is this.	Imataq kay.
Everyone had the same idea.	Lliwmi huk yuyayniyuq karqaku.
He did it very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
He is right there.	Payqa chayllam kachkan.
He did a lot of things.	Payqa achkatam ruwarqa.
I didn’t want to either.	Ñoqapas manan munarqanichu.
He was hungry.	Payqa yarqasqa kasqa.
Baby, don’t do this.	Wawa, ama kayta ruwaychu.
It’s good not bad.	Allinmi mana mana allinchu.
This was three days ago.	Kayqa kimsa punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
There was no lack of time.	Manam mana tiempo karqachu.
I think of a lot.	Yuyaykuni achkata.
There is such a thing as too late.	Chay hinaqa kanmi ancha tarde nisqa.
In fact, it doesn’t matter.	Aswanpas manan imananpaschu.
But that wasn’t the case, of course.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, cheqaqtapunin.
I am trying to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
It was midnight.	Kuska tutam karqa.
I haven’t found one yet.	Manaraqmi hukta tarinichu.
They want to make money.	Paykunaqa qullqita tariyta munanku.
They’re more contemporary.	Paykunaqa aswan kunan pacha kanku.
It’s good, it’s good.	Allinmi allin.
Unfortunately, both can be useful.	Llakikuypaqmi, iskayninkum allin kanman.
A very good player.	Ancha allin pukllaq.
He was a heavy smoker.	Payqa sinchitan cigarrota pitaq karqan.
He wasn't sure what had caused it.	Imataq chayta ruwasqanmanta manas segurochu kasqa.
I don’t really know why.	Mana chiqaptachu yachani imarayku.
What can you do there.	Imatataq chaypi ruwawaq.
That obviously didn’t go too well.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana ancha allintachu rirqan.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manam ruwayta atirqachu.
In fact, they were very present.	Aswanpas anchatan chaypi karqanku.
He began to think more carefully.	Aswan allinta yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa.
This coffee is really delicious.	Kay kukata chiqamanta sumaq.
Then again maybe not.	Chaymanta yapamanta ichapas mana.
If you don't, you're doing it wrong.	Mana chayta ruwaptikiqa mana allintam ruwachkanki.
A couple of times, maybe.	Huk iskay kutita, ichapas.
You’re so nice you don’t want to.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki mana munasqaykita.
The last person said this.	Qhepa kaq runaqa kaytan nirqan.
This is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa chhayna.
But no one can say that he knows the truth.	Ichaqa manan pipas niyta atinmanchu cheqaqta yachasqayta.
Okay, in more ways than one.	Allinmi, aswan hukmanta.
Actually, two now.	Chiqaptaqa, iskay kunan.
That’s the second step.	Chayqa iskay kaq ruwaymi.
And he knows that.	Hinaspa chayta yachan.
I was sure it was something else.	Seguro karqani huk imapas kasqanmanta.
But he did do it.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
And that was for the best.	Hinaspa chayqa allinpaq karqan.
He said good day.	Payqa allin p’unchawmi nisqa.
The process is not difficult.	Chay ruwayqa mana sasachu.
This seems great for some reason.	Kayqa imaraykupas ancha allinmi rikchakun.
No one seemed surprised.	Manam pipas admirasqa hinachu karqa.
Now he can do nothing.	Kunanqa manan imatapas ruwanmanchu.
There is such a thing.	Chayna kaqmi kachkan.
All this quick stuff.	Tukuy kay utqaylla imakuna.
It was better that someone said this.	Pipas kayta nisqanqa aswan allinmi karqan.
One thing was too many.	Huk kaqmi karqa llumpay achka.
The date and month are confused.	Mayqin p’unchaw kasqanmanta, mayqin killa kasqanmanta ima, pantasqa kanku.
I’m pretty easy going.	Ñuqaqa ancha facilmi kani.
But he was probably as funny as everyone else.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá llapa runakuna hina asikunapaq hina karqan.
You do whatever it takes to make it better.	Allin kananpaqmi imatapas ruwanki.
That’s why we are.	Chayraykum kanchik.
No one could have worked harder.	Manan pipas aswan llank’ayta atinmanchu karqan.
He wanted to know where it could be.	Payqa yachayta munarqa maypi kanman chayta.
First, there is.	Ñawpaqtaqa kanmi.
They want to talk about everything.	Tukuy imamanta rimayta munanku.
But it wasn’t the first time.	Ichaqa manan chay hinata ñawpaq kutichu karqan.
But he didn’t stay long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu qhepakurqan.
So, tell me how it feels.	Chaymi, willaway imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Probably no one does.	Yaqapaschá mana pipas chayta ruwanchu.
The man lives in the house.	Chay runaqa chay wasipi tiyan.
So then it’s not good enough.	Chaymi chaymantaqa mana allinchu.
The people who.	Chay runakuna.
I’ve heard it many times.	Achka kutitam uyarirqani.
Say what you want to someone.	Pimanpas munasqaykita niy.
They were happily together for two years.	Paykunaqa kusisqa iskay wata kuska karqanku.
I didn’t always do that.	Manam sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
I know that he will.	Yachanim chayna ruwananta.
To do otherwise is foolish.	Hukta ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi.
Last night.	Qayna tuta.
But that will never happen.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayqa kanqachu.
I think about what will happen.	Yuyaykuni imakuna pasananta.
It was about .	Chayqa karqan yaqa .
I can work hard.	Sinchitan llank’ayta atiyman.
But if it isn’t.	Ichaqa mana chayqa.
Here is the letter.	Kaypim kachkan chay cartata.
He wants to know who the person is.	Pichus chay runa kasqanta yachayta munan.
He is like clothes.	Payqa pacha hinam.
They are becoming more popular every day.	Sapa punchawmi aswan riqsisqa kachkanku.
I really do.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam.
After that, he knew nothing could stop him.	Chay qhepamanmi yacharqan mana imapas hark’ayta atisqanmanta.
I was arrested.	Hap'isqa karqani.
He wants to know everything about everything.	Tukuy imamanta tukuy imamanta yachayta munan.
He was really worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kasharqan.
It seems to do that.	Chayta ruwanman hina.
Yes, that’s what he meant.	Arí, chaytan niyta munarqan.
That there was nothing wrong with it.	Mana imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I wanted to know more.	Astawan yachayta munarqani.
That way it will be easier.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
To do with him.	Paywan ruwanapaq.
I think you know that.	Chayta yachasqaykita yuyani.
He’s very clear.	Payqa ancha sut’inmi.
He was a man of yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchaw runam karqa.
Very young and very, very sick.	Ancha wayna hinaspa ancha, ancha unqusqa.
They are at home.	Paykunaqa wasipi kachkanku.
Ten nights.	Chunka tuta.
Now is the time to act.	Kunanmi imatapas ruwana.
Anything will do, really.	Imapas ruwanqa, chiqaptapuni.
I don’t understand that.	Chaytaqa manam entiendenichu.
More than one.	Hukmanta aswan.
He lives there now.	Payqa kunan chaypi tiyan.
I should have been happy.	Kusisqam kanay karqa.
It was a stupid thing to do.	Chayqa sonso ruwaymi karqa.
Then, two things happened.	Chaymanta, iskay imakuna pasarqa.
You go so you go.	Qamqa rinki chaymi rinki.
It makes no sense, that is.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu, chaymi.
But everything went very well.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas ancha allintam rirqa.
He is always worried.	Payqa sapa kutim llakisqa kachkan.
He said he didn't.	Payqa nirqam mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But he knew there was more to it than that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaymanta aswan askha kasqanmanta.
So it should be taken more seriously.	Chaymi aswan allinpaq hapisqa kanan.
But he wanted something.	Ichaqa imatapas munarqanmi.
So say it.	Chaymi niy.
I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munanichu.
That would have happened earlier.	Chayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kanman karqa.
He’s not in a hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu.
It would be nice to be at home.	Allinmi kanman wasipi kayqa.
The second time, it went horribly wrong.	Iskay kaq kutipi, manchay pantasqa rirqa.
And he’s in trouble.	Hinaspa payqa sasachakuypi tarikun.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi.
So good, very good.	Chayna allin, ancha allin.
Don’t forget this.	Kaytaqa ama qunqaychu.
He spent two days in the hospital.	Iskay punchawmi hospitalpi karqa.
This world, black.	Kay pacha, yana.
That, perhaps, was a good thing.	Chayqa, ichapas, allin karqa.
I can't stand what happens to you.	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu qamwan imapas pasananta.
And then you.	Hinaspa chaymanta qam.
He said he felt good.	Payqa allinmi sientekusqanmanta nirqa.
But I really wanted him to.	Ichaqa anchatan munarqani chayta ruwananta.
That’s great, thank you.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, gracias.
Maybe it would be very useful.	Ichapas ancha allin kanman.
He soon learned the trade.	Pisi tiempollamantan chay llank’ayta yacharqan.
I just feel like I’m out of place.	Chaylla mana maypipas kasqayta hina sientekuni.
He was alone now.	Payqa kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
He is the richest man in the world.	Payqa kay pachapi aswan qhapaq runan.
You’d better go.	Aswan allinmi kanman riy.
Many, many times.	Achka, achka kuti.
That’s right, one by one.	Chayqa allinmi, hukmanta hukmanta.
That’s what he wants to be.	Chayqa pay kayta munan.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
He was a human being.	Payqa runan karqan.
He looks pathetic.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
There may not be enough beauty here.	Kaypiqa manapaschá allintachu sumaq kayqa kanman.
But he wanted to wait.	Ichaqa suyayta munarqa.
That’s a very smart thing to do.	Chayqa ancha yachaysapa ruwaymi.
Yes, this is going to be a weird year.	Arí, kayqa huk mana riqsisqa wata kanqa.
He was more worried about it.	Aswan llakisqa kasqa chaymanta.
I can do that right now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwayman.
I’m a teacher.	Ñuqam yachachiq kani.
I didn't want him to say more than he wanted.	Manam munarqanichu munasqanmanta aswan achkata rimananpaq.
He didn’t know what was going to happen.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kananta.
That was a good talk.	Chay rimayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
The harsh truth is that no one is safe.	Sinchi cheqaq kaqmi, manan pipas segurochu kashan.
You know where it is.	Yachankim maypi kasqanmanta.
The importance of school.	Yachay wasi ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Not like it is now.	Mana kunan hinachu.
There are all the people.	Chaypin kashan llapan runakuna.
I don’t know where to go from here.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta mayman riyta.
But there is something.	Ichaqa kanmi imapas.
It’s one of them.	Hukninmi.
He wanted to know where she was.	Payqa maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
I was no longer a human being	Manañam runachu karqani
I heard it happened here	Uyarirqanim kaypi pasasqanmanta
Everyone wants it.	Llapallankum munanku.
He continued to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
You know you are happy.	Yachankim kusisqa kasqaykita.
I feel good about everything	Tukuy imamanta allinta sientekuni
No one could stand it.	Manam pipas aguantayta atirqachu.
I think he did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I’m crazy enough to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi loco kani
One day, go for a walk.	Huk punchaw, puriq riy.
He didn’t do that, you know.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu, yachanki.
They are the bad guys.	Paykunaqa mana allin runakunam kanku.
I just couldn’t understand it	Chaylla mana entiendeyta atirqanichu
I can't imagine why	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I was ready to do it	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi listoña karqani
But he was very much like that.	Ichaqa payqa anchatan chay hina karqan.
I’m willing to do it	Chaytaqa ruwanaypaqmi listo kashani
He couldn't remember anything.	Manam imatapas yuyariyta atirqachu.
I knew he was a real person	Yacharqanim chiqap runa kasqanmanta
I mean really, really good	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin niyta munani
Tell me what you know.	Willaway ima yachasqaykita.
I didn’t realize it was this week	Manam repararqanichu kay semana kasqanmanta
He wanted to ask why.	Payqa tapuyta munarqa imanasqa chayta.
But I want to know	Ichaqa yachayta munani
He didn't have to do anything.	Payqa manam imatapas ruwananchu karqa.
It just happened right away.	Chayllaraqmi chaylla pasarqa.
He will do well.	Payqa allintam ruwanqa.
That’s a good thing for now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa allinmi.
Maybe it’s here somewhere.	Ichapas kaypi kanman maypipas.
Still not really.	Kunankamapas manam chiqaptachu.
There are two ways to do it.	Iskay ruwaymi kan.
I can’t leave it out here	Manam kay hawapi saqiyta atiymanchu
I don’t necessarily want to say this is going to happen	Manam allintachu niyta munani kayna kananta
I don’t remember anything	Manam imatapas yuyarinichu
There will be another player.	Huk pukllaqmi kanqa.
I thought that would be easy	Chayqa facilmi kananta piensarqani
I can never remember his name	Manam haykapipas sutinta yuyariyta atinichu
I know all of this is nonsense	Yachanim tukuy kaykunaqa mana yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I really didn't want to see him	Chiqaptaqa manam payta qawayta munarqanichu
I’m so sorry, not really	Anchatan llakikuni, manan cheqaqtachu
I don’t want him to fail	Manam munanichu mana allinta ruwananpaqqa
It was actually the best thing he had ever done.	Chiqaptaqa aswan allin ruwaymi karqa haykapipas ruwasqanmanta.
I know you don't mean it	Yachanim mana chayta niyta munasqaykita
I didn’t want to know more	Manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu
I didn’t want to see this	Manam kayta qawayta munarqanichu
They are too big, or too big.	Paykunaqa ancha hatunmi, utaq ancha hatunmi.
I'll be here	Kaypi kasaq
No, it doesn’t matter.	Manan, manan imananpaschu.
I learn quickly.	Utqaylla yachani.
I didn't think you were really hurt	Manam piensarqanichu chiqaptapuni k'irisqa kasqaykita
He knew exactly what he was going to do.	Payqa allintan yacharqan ima ruwananta.
That was always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
I wonder where we are	Maypi kanchik chayta tapukuni
I think so, too.	Ñuqapas chaynatam piensani.
I’m doing it hard.	Sinchitan ruwani.
I’m pretty sure he couldn’t	Yaqapaschá seguro kani mana chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta
I never want to know	Manam haykapipas yachayta munanichu
It's something that just seems so real.	Chayqa imapas ancha chiqap hinallam rikchakun.
It’s going to be a great night.	Hatun tutam kanqa.
It was ridiculously difficult.	Asikunapaq hina sasa karqa.
Now I am not so sure.	Kunanqa manam chayna segurochu kani.
I’m really looking forward to this	Chiqamanta kayta suyachkani
That’s why I listen.	Chayraykum uyarini.
I don’t want it to last that long	Mana chay unaytachu kananta munani
It will come next summer.	Hamuq chiri killapi hamunqa.
I don’t like it now	Kunanqa manam gustawanchu
I think he’s injured	Yuyaykuni k’irisqa kasqanmanta
He knows it now.	Payqa kunanmi yachan.
I felt like a new person	Musuq runa hinam tarikurqani
I think he would have been proud	Yuyaykuni orgulloso kanman karqan
I really like that guy	Chay runaqa anchatam gustan
Nothing sounds like mindfulness at all.	Mana imapas yuyayniyuq kay hinachu uyarikun ni imapipas.
Make a lot of money.	Ruway achka qullqita.
I couldn’t be happier.	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atirqanichu.
But, that doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
But he doesn’t want to stay.	Ichaqa manan qhepakuyta munanchu.
He was happy that he now had someone to talk to.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan kunan piwanpas rimananpaq kashasqanmanta.
Something's wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin.
I went there today, but no one was home	Kunan punchawmi chayman rirqani, ichaqa manam pipas wasinpi karqachu
There he began making the film	Chaypim chay peliculata ruwayta qallaykurqa
No, such a cold and beautiful person can’t be human.	Manan, chay hina chiri sumaq runaqa manan runa kayta atinmanchu.
In fact, he would never do it.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas ruwanmanchu.
I have to do things right	Imakunatapas allintam ruwanay
I wasn’t sure what he was doing now	Manam segurochu karqani kunan ima ruwasqanmanta
I didn’t know how to respond	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kutichiyta
This means that.	Kayqa niyta munan.
I didn’t really think about it at all	Manam chiqaptaqa ni imapipas piensarqanichu
That was about two weeks ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
But nothing went right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allintachu rirqan.
You know what you look like.	Yachankim imayna rikchayniyuq kasqaykita.
I thought about it carefully.	Chaytaqa allintam piensarqani.
I hope to get a lot more of this back	Suyachkani kaymanta aswan achka kutichiyta tariyta
I want to know if it’s right or not	Allinchu icha manachu chayta yachayta munani
But you can’t stay late.	Ichaqa manan tardeta qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
I want to help you	Yanapayta munani
I agreed to do it	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi arí nirqani
He said she was beautiful, and smart.	Payqa sumaqmi, hinaspa yachaysapa kasqanmantam nirqa.
He can't hold anything.	Mana imatapas hapiyta atinchu.
And he’s right.	Hinaspa payqa allinta.
I can’t stand it anymore	Manañam aguantayta atinichu
What’s the possibility.	¿Imataq kanman.
I want to be a teacher.	Yachachiq kaytam munani.
That was later on.	Chayqa karqan qhepamanmi.
You know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachanki.
I couldn’t leave him	Manam paytaqa saqiyta atirqanichu
Every day was something.	Sapa punchawmi imapas karqa.
That makes things easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi imapas.
I don’t understand anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa entiendenichu
Adults living alone.	Sapallan tiyaq kuraq runakuna.
I think it was two years ago now.	Yuyaykuni kunanqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
A year and a half ago.	Huk wata kuskan ñawpaqta.
Yes, it will be.	Arí, chaymi kanqa.
I truly feel sorry for him	Cheqaqtapunin paytaqa llakikuni
Not you and me.	Mana qamwan ñuqawanqa.
It would be a great hour.	Hatun hora kanman.
I’m waiting for him to come.	Suyachkani hamunanta.
I didn’t expect that	Manam chaytaqa suyarqanichu
I never know what he will do about it	Manam haykapipas yachanichu chaymanta ima ruwananta
That’s a good thing.	Chayqa allin kaqmi.
I’m so excited about it.	Ñuqaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I hope he's not afraid	Suyachkani mana manchakusqanmanta
Said he was.	Nisqa payqa kasqanmanta.
But that may not really be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá cheqaqtachu chhayna kanman.
So cold, so very cold.	Chayna chiri, chayna ancha chiri.
And that wouldn’t be right.	Hinaspa chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
It was a very big deal for me.	Ancha hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
If you don’t want to be there, that’s fine.	Sichus mana munankichu chaypi kayta chayqa, allinmi.
I know, it was amazing	Yachanim, admirakuypaqmi karqa
I really want to see it	Anchatam munani qawayta
I want to fix everything	Tukuy imata allichayta munani
There were two men.	Iskay runakunam karqaku.
Can you do it for yourself.	¿Atiwaqchu qampaq.
A real person.	Chiqap runa.
I know that's all he is.	Yachanim chaylla pay kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t drive.	Manam carrota manejayta atirqanichu.
I hope he's not home now	Suyachkani kunan mana wasinpi kasqanmanta
He gave her one.	Paymi hukta qorqan.
If you don't have it, you want it really bad.	Mana kanchu chayqa, chiqap mana allintam munanki.
So if something goes wrong, let me know.	Chaymi imapas mana allin kaptinqa willaway.
He will never have what he wants.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas munasqanman hinachu kanqa.
This is the truth.	Kaymi cheqaq kaq.
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanqa manañam chayna segurochu karqa.
I mean, they used to be	Niyta munani, ñawpaqtaqa chayna karqanku
I couldn't think about it again	Chaypiqa manañam hukmanta yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I think people have always been people	Yuyaykuni runakunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi runakuna kasqankuta
I’m not really worried about that	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu llakikuni
I can’t say anything	Manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu
It really said something to me.	Chiqaptam imatapas niwarqa.
I don’t care, really.	Manam imananpaschu, chiqaptaqa.
I’ve never heard of it	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu
Said.	Nisqa.
I doubt it, but maybe	Iskayrayani, ichaqa ichapas
You were happy.	Kusisqam karqanki.
He really knows stuff.	Payqa chiqaptam yachan imakunatapas.
I don’t understand it yet	Manaraqmi entiendenichu
I just wished you weren't with him	Chayllam munarqani mana paywan kasqaykita
I can’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
There is nothing like a child.	Wawa hinaqa manam imapas kanchu.
You can’t be sure.	Manan seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
There was no one anywhere yet.	Manaraqmi maypipas pipas karqachu.
I wasn’t sure you were here before	Manam segurochu karqani ñawpaqta kaypi kasqaykita
I know what you’re thinking	Yachanin imatachus yuyaykusqaykita
They were regular people	Paykunaqa sapa kutilla runakunam karqaku
I couldn't say how many times	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka kutita
I was the only one there	Ñuqallam chaypiqa karqani
That’s the name.	Chayqa sutin.
I couldn't tell which one it was	Manam yachayta atirqanichu mayqin kasqanmantaqa
There is a lot to do.	Achkatam ruwana.
A year ago this would have been amazing	Huk wata ñawpaqtaqa kayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman karqa
I tried a lot but I couldn't	Achkatam kallpanchakurqani ichaqa manam atirqanichu
I am very much looking forward to it	Anchatam suyachkani chayta
I never want to see her again	Manam haykapipas hukmanta rikuyta munanichu
Everyone was a little nervous.	Lliwmi huk chikan mancharisqa karqaku.
You’re nowhere to be found.	Mana maypipas kanki.
He knows that we did.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
Yes, he should be.	Arí, paymi kanan.
I have heard them many times	Chaykunataqa achka kutitam uyarirqani
So this should be a secret.	Chaymi kayqa pakasqa kanan.
That moment, that night.	Chay rato, chay tuta.
I can’t, for some reason	Manam atiymanchu, imaraykupas
I have to do a speech tonight.	Kunan tutam rimayta ruwanay kachkan.
I didn’t think about it	Chaypiqa manam piensarqanichu
No, not really, he says.	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu, nispas nin.
He’s fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi.
I have to do something tonight	Kunan tutaqa imatapas ruwanay kachkan
Yes, it has happened before.	Arí, ñawpaqtaraqmi chayna pasarqa.
I have to make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwanay
I can't deal with it anymore	Manañam chaywanqa atipayta atiymanchu
It’s really really awesome.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta manchay.
I knew it was not going to be easy	Yacharqanim chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kananta
There’s something here.	Kaypiqa imapas kanmi.
He's having a party.	Payqa huk fiestata ruwachkan.
I know about everything.	Tukuy imamanta yachani.
I wasn’t the only one who was surprised	Manam ñuqallachu admirakurqani
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
Now they know better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam yachanku.
So that was a challenge.	Chaymi chayqa sasachakuy karqan.
It is indeed very good.	Cheqaqtapunin ancha allin.
Not much good about it.	Mana ancha allinchu chaymanta.
A few things, actually	Iskay kimsa imakuna, chiqaptaqa
And then this happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta kayqa pasarqa.
I’m better at it.	Chaypiqa aswan allinmi kani.
You are, or you are not.	Qamqa kanki, icha manachu kanki.
I’m a guy who’s a guy.	Ñoqaqa qanmi kani.
Unfortunately, this was very difficult.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa ancha sasa karqa.
I know it won’t help	Yachanim mana yanapananta
I'll do it right away.	Chaylla ruwasaq.
I’m sure he did	Seguro kani chayta ruwasqanmanta
He is not doing his best.	Payqa manan tukuy atisqanman hinachu ruwashan.
Find out what it looks like here!.	¡Kaypi imayna kasqanmanta yachay!.
I have no idea what it is	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima kasqanmantaqa
Nothing is right anymore.	Manañam imapas allinchu.
How can such a child be.	Imaynataq chayna wawa kanman.
I have done this many times	Askha kutitan chaytaqa ruwarqani
Everything out there in nothing.	Tukuy ima hawapi mana imapipas.
He really had no choice.	Cheqaqtapunin mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I hope that doesn’t happen again	Suyachkani manaña chayna kananta
I know they are strange	Yachanim mana riqsisqa kasqankuta
I know he didn't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wasn’t ready to talk	Manam rimanaypaq listochu karqani
I feel pretty good about it now.	Kunanqa allintam chaymantaqa tarikuni.
I had nowhere else to go	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq karqachu
I didn't think things would be that bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas chayna mana allin kananta
Like at home.	Wasipi hina.
I didn’t want to do those things.	Chaykunataqa manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
Maybe he really doesn’t like me	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni mana gustawanchu
What would it have been.	Imataq kanman karqa.
Everything else.	Tukuy wakin imakuna.
Everything should be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanan.
I wasn’t ready to talk about it	Manam listochu karqani chaymanta rimanaypaq
But that didn't mean anything.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
By doing it right.	Allinta ruwaspa.
He was so happy to be able to say it.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkarqa chayta rimayta atisqanmanta.
I did, but that one failed.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa chay hukninmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He’s not very good.	Payqa manan ancha allinchu.
Some people are more pessimistic.	Wakin runakunaqa aswan mana allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I know how hard it is for you	Yachanim imayna sasa qampaq kasqanmanta
It is fairly easy to do so.	Chayta ruwayqa allin facilmi.
It’s better for me.	Aswan allinmi ñuqapaq.
There’s a second day and a second hour	Iskay kaq p’unchay, iskay kaq hora ima kan
I couldn’t think of anyone	Manam pitapas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
It was a very nice experience	Ancha sumaqmi karqan
But it may not have been good enough.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu karqan.
That’s not the best anymore.	Chayqa manañan aswan allinchu.
He wasn't here.	Payqa manam kaypichu karqa.
I don’t know, to be honest with you.	Manam yachanichu, qamwan chiqap rimanaypaq.
Like him, I knew it was true	Ñuqapas pay hinam chiqap kasqanmanta yacharqani
I couldn’t leave him.	Manam paytaqa saqiyta atirqanichu.
He would never have done that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
I was really surprised how good this was	Chiqaptam admirakurqani kay allin kasqanmanta
I had no time to tell	Manam tiempoy karqachu willanaypaq
Time may not exist.	Tiempo manapaschá kanchu.
But I wasn’t always like that	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqani
And herein lies the problem.	Hinaspa kaypi tarikun sasachakuy.
I am very proud of that	Chaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso kani
I didn’t want to be alone with him	Manam paywan sapallay kayta munarqanichu
They were probably too busy.	Paykunaqa yaqapaschá llumpay ocupasqa karqaku.
It was very, very impressive.	Ancha ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I thought that was fine with that	Chaywanqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I can do better.	Aswan allintam ruwayman.
What will be the result?.	¿Imataq kanqa?.
I’ve never seen such wisdom either	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu chhayna yachayta
In fact, it could have been worse.	Chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan.
I really want to know	Anchatam yachayta munani
This should be done once a year.	Chaytaqa sapa wata huk kutitam ruwana.
I didn't do it today.	Manam kunan punchawchu ruwarqani.
Please don’t do that.	Ama hina kaspa, ama chayta ruwaychu.
I have no idea what the problem is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta
Now I want to get this.	Kunanqa kayta hap’iyta munani.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
I really have no choice now	Chiqamanta kunanqa manaña ima ruwaytapas atinichu
This is the big day.	Kaymi hatun punchaw.
I want to do those things now	Chaykunataqa kunan ruwayta munani
I just didn’t want to hear it	Chaylla mana uyariyta munarqanichu
Please let me know what works best for you.	Ama hina kaspa, imachus qampaq aswan allin kasqanmanta willaway.
There was no time now.	Kunanqa manañam tiempo karqachu.
I know you were there last night	Yachanim qayna tuta chaypi kasqaykita
I mean, if you do, that’s fine	Niyta munani, chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi
But, this is the problem.	Ichaqa, kaymi sasachakuy.
There is no beauty there.	Chaypiqa manam sumaq kayqa kanchu.
He was genuinely excited.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kasharqan.
Okay, they have good intentions.	Allinmi, paykunaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Maybe this is a good thing.	Ichapas kayqa allin kanman.
Do the best you can.	Aswan allin kaqta ruway.
So far I haven't really been impressed	Kunankamaqa manam chiqaptachu admirakurqani
I haven’t been able to do that yet	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
Something else did.	Huk imapas ruwarqa.
Two, the characters are interesting.	Iskay, chaypi kaq runakunaqa sumaqmi.
You’re good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kanki.
I did the same thing	Chaynatam ruwarqani
I couldn’t do it for him	Manam paypaq ruwayta atirqanichu
But everything was fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
We can’t be together.	Manam kuska kayta atichwanchu.
I want to see something very soon	Ancha utqaylla imapas qawayta munani
I could never stand that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas aguantayta atirqanichu
I had him in school.	Yachay wasipi paytaqa karqani.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Mana yachanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
Me, I’m the first one.	Ñuqa, ñawpaq kaqmi kani.
I was a good guy.	Allin runam karqani.
There was nothing	Manam imapas karqachu
How about not.	Imaynataq mana.
It may not be right for you.	Manapaschá qanpaq hinachu kanman.
I have always said that.	Chaynataqa sapa kutim nirqani.
I want to be with him all the time	Tukuy tiempo paywan kayta munani
He was very drunk.	Payqa ancha machasqa kasqa.
They know what’s coming.	Paykunaqa yachanku ima hamunanta.
That’s why I’m here.	Chayraykum kaypi kachkani.
In fact, it is rather depressing.	Aswanpas aswan llakikuypaqmi.
No, after that.	Manan, chaymanta qhepaman.
I look forward to hearing from you again	Suyachkani hukmanta uyariyta
I really didn’t know anything though	Chiqaptaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu ichaqa
I still wonder if it really is	Hinallam tapukuni sichus chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta
I don’t want to go outside now.	Manam kunanqa hawaman lluqsiyta munanichu.
But something is going wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allintam ruwachkan.
I really wanted to get out.	Anchatam lluqsiyta munarqani.
I want to finish that journey	Chay puriyta tukuyta munani
Whatever you want.	Ima kaptinpas munanki.
I never thought about it	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu
According to this.	Kayman hina.
I can’t focus too much on it	Manam anchatachu chaypi yuyaymanayta atiyman
I learned that later	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi yacharqani
Now they are bigger.	Kunanqa aswan hatunmi kachkanku.
I want it to be wrong more than anything	Imamantapas aswan pantasqa kananta munani
Do a great job.	Hatun llamkayta ruway.
He is present now.	Payqa kunanmi kachkan.
I should have done something the first time	Ñawpaq kutipi imatapas ruwanay kanman karqan
I know you can hold it for you	Yachanim qampaq hapiyta atisqaykita
A man rushed to help	Huk runam chaylla yanapananpaq rirqa
But he knew nothing.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu.
I can’t do anything about it	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu
I had a lot to do yesterday	Qayna punchawmi achka ruwanay karqa
That’s what he meant one evening.	Chaytan huk ch’isi niyta munarqan.
But I heard it	Ichaqa uyarirqanim
Maybe I need to do it more often	Ichapas aswan achka kutita chayta ruwanay kanqa
It looks familiar.	Riqsisqa rikchakun.
I learned as much as I did	Ñuqapas chaynatam achkata yacharqani
I couldn’t do anything about it	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I wasn’t at all excited about it	Manam chaymantaqa ni imapipas kusisqachu karqani
I hadn’t thought of that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa yuyaykurqanichu
We really are.	Chiqaptam kanchik.
If you know anything, let me know.	Imatapas yachanki chayqa, willaway.
One person was injured.	Huk runam k’irisqa karqan.
And you do tonight.	Hinaspa kunan tuta ruwanki.
I'm looking forward to it	Anchatam suyachkani
I plan to study further.	Astawan estudiayta yuyaykuni.
I am, in fact, that person.	Ñuqaqa, chiqaptaqa, chay runam kani.
They are the ones who are.	Paykunaqa chayna kachkanku.
But I need to act quickly	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanay
Who knows though.	Pitaq yachan ichaqa.
He did really well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta ruwarqa.
A little uncertainty was good for him	Huk chikan mana seguro kaymi allin karqa paypaq
I live there sometimes too.	Ñuqapas chaypim wakin kutipi yachani.
Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas qampas kanki.
I wasn’t at all sure what was going to happen	Manam imapipas segurochu karqani imakuna pasananta
Then again, again.	Chaymanta yapamanta, yapamanta.
I couldn't eat it now	Kunanqa manam mikhuyta atirqanichu
Like a good meal.	Allin mikhuy hina.
I think that would have been great	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
I couldn't believe the time would go by so fast	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna utqaylla tiempo pasananta
I had some trouble with that	Chaywanmi wakin sasachakuypi tarikurqani
Making it more interesting.	Aswan sumaq kananpaq ruwaspa.
Then I was the one.	Chaymantam ñuqaqa karqani.
No, say no to it.	Manan, mana nispa niy.
I wonder what he’ll do now	Tapukunitaqmi kunan imatataq ruwanqa nispa
Hopefully this never happens	Munaymanmi kay mana haykapipas pasananta
I knew this was stupid	Yacharqanim kayqa sonso kasqanmanta
Nothing, nothing.	Mana imapas, mana imapas.
I’m sure we did something very important last weekend.	Seguro kani qayna semana tukukuypi imapas ancha importante ruwasqaykumanta.
But he says it right.	Ichaqa allintam nin.
I want to stay here for a while	Kaypi huk rato qhepakuyta munani
I wanted to answer that	Chaytaqa kutichiyta munarqani
This isn’t me.	Kayqa manam ñuqachu.
I can't stand to see him anymore.	Manañam aguantayta atinichu payta qawayta.
I couldn’t tell	Manam willayta atirqanichu
He could see nothing.	Payqa manan imatapas rikuyta atirqanchu.
He loves to travel.	Payqa anchatam munan puriyta.
That doesn’t mean it’s not true.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana cheqaqchu kasqanmanta.
I will be expelled.	qarqusqa kasaq.
I think you can do great things.	Yuyaykuni hatun ruwaykunata ruwayta atisqaykita.
It is in action again day and night.	Tuta punchawmi yapamanta ruwaypi kachkan.
And you’ll have fun doing it.	Hinaspa chayta ruwaspa kusisqa kanki.
He knew something was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas pasananta.
He didn’t want to ask.	Payqa manan tapuyta munarqanchu.
I don’t see what it is	Manam rikunichu ima kasqanmanta
I did a lot with it	Chaywanmi anchata ruwarqani
He probably never noticed.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas repararqanchu.
I was almost disappointed.	Yaqapaschá hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap kanman.
I always wanted to do something	Sapa kutillanmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani
I need this really badly	Chiqamanta sinchita kayta necesitasaq
By now he knew how to do it well.	Kunankamaqa allintan yacharqan chayta ruwayta.
Looks good doesn't it.	Allinmi rikchakun manachu.
I want to be there too.	Ñuqapas chaypim munani.
I’m not sure about driving	Mana segurochu kani manejayta
I knew he wanted to come	Yacharqanim hamuyta munasqanmanta
I want to know what’s in there	Chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani
Every last one.	Sapa qhipa kaq.
I’m already worried.	Ñam llakisqa kachkani.
I can't wait to quit this job	Manam suyayta atinichu kay llamkayta saqiyta
I wasn’t comfortable with it at all	Manam allintachu chaywanqa karqani ni imapipas
I didn’t want to work	Manam llamkayta munarqanichu
That’s the only thing, maybe.	Chaylla imapas, ichapas.
I had no idea what he meant	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta
I want to make a game	Huk pukllayta ruwayta munani
But there’s no chance.	Ichaqa manan kanchu chansa.
He didn’t know how much but one thing was for sure.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a kasqanmanta ichaqa huk kaqmi seguro karqan.
I can’t seem to get a hold of it	Manapaschá chaymantaqa hap’iyta atiymanchu hina
He opened the door.	Paymi kicharirqa.
I need it so much.	Anchatam necesitasaq.
So happy to be here.	Chaymi kusisqa kaypi kasqaymanta.
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinam kachkan.
He couldn't do that again.	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atirqachu.
I’ve wanted to go for a long time.	Unayñan riyta munani.
I'm going with him tonight	Kunan tutam paywan risaq
I felt drunk, anyway	Machasqa hinam tarikurqani, imayna kaptinpas
I’ll be better tomorrow.	Paqarinmi aswan allin kasaq.
I knew when you said it	Yacharqanim haykapi nisqaykita
It’s actually good.	Chiqaptaqa allinmi.
I really want that	Chaytaqa anchatam munani
I can’t talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta atinichu.
I couldn't believe it	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu
That's a new thing.	Chayqa huk musuq kaqmi.
I’m not the bad guy here	Manam kaypi millay runachu kani
He couldn’t do it now.	Payqa manan kunanqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
But things aren’t too bad here.	Ichaqa manan kaypiqa ancha mana allinchu imapas.
He died a few years later.	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I mean never to talk about it again.	Niyta munani manaña hayk’aqpas chaymanta rimanaypaq.
He had an idea.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
I’ve been thinking about it for a long time	Unayñan yuyaykushani
I didn’t want to, not yet	Manam munarqanichu, manaraqmi
I know he will be happy	Yachanim kusisqa kananta
But, here it is.	Ichaqa, kaypim kachkan.
I was with him for about two years	Yaqa iskay watañam paywan karqani
I didn’t really know what was going on	Manam allintachu yacharqani imakuna pasasqanmanta
They weren’t ready yet.	Paykunaqa manaraqmi listochu karqanku.
So then this was it.	Chaymi chaymanta kayqa karqa.
He'll come here, he says.	Kaypi hamunqa, nispas nin.
I’ve always done well	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi allinta ruwarqani
We are intelligent people.	Yachaysapa runakunam kanchik.
I'm not sure if it should.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chayna kananmanta.
I could never stand him	Manam haykapipas paytaqa aguantayta atirqanichu
I mean, somebody had to do it.	Niyta munani, pipas ruwanan karqan.
That’s what he told you.	Chaytan nisurqanki.
I never really thought about it	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu
I couldn’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
And that, yes, would be crazy.	Hinaspa chayqa, arí, loco kanman.
I didn’t want that at all.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu ni imapipas.
I just didn’t want him to be there.	Chaylla mana munarqanichu chaypi kananta.
And this doesn't seem right.	Hinaspa kayqa mana allinchu rikchakun.
I found out a few hours ago	Iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani
I can’t talk to him now	Kunanqa manan paywan rimayta atiymanchu
I didn’t see enough of them to tell you	Manam chaykunataqa allintachu rikurqani willanaypaq
I really wanted to go	Anchatam riyta munarqani
I had no idea where you were	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani maypi kasqaykita
I didn't think so	Manam chaynataqa piensarqanichu
It’s not a human being.	Manam huk runachu.
And you know what, that’s good.	Hinaspa yachanki ima, chayqa allinmi.
And he died accordingly.	Hinan chayman hina wañupurqan.
The people are terribly beautiful.	Runakunaqa manchay sumaqmi kanku.
I couldn’t go out or do anything	Manam lluqsiyta nitaq ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I knew something bad was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin pasananta
Of course, he was.	Chiqamanta, payqa karqa.
Okay, with you this afternoon.	Allinmi, kunan tarde qanwan.
Now if I could take the time.	Kunanqa sichus tiempota hap’iyta atiyman chayqa.
Many other people	Achka huk runakuna
What a young man.	Ima wayna.
It was really very uncomfortable for me.	Chiqamanta ancha mana allin karqa ñuqapaq.
This can be a complicated process.	Kayqa huk sasachakuy ruwaymi kanman.
A few years later, he actually got one	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi cheqaqtapuni hukta hap’irqan
He doesn’t.	Payqa manan.
I don’t know exactly	Manam allintachu yachani
It’s not good for you.	Manam allinchu qampaq.
I couldn't understand what it was	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
He really wanted to be there.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chaypi kayta.
Sometimes for the better though, not always.	Wakin kuti allinpaq ichaqa, mana sapa kutichu.
Maybe not anyone.	Ichapas mana pipas.
This is probably the most important part of the whole process.	Kayqa yaqapaschá llapan ruwaypi aswan importante kaq.
You will have to do something with it.	Chaywanmi imatapas ruwanayki kanqa.
It’s not safe by any means.	Manam imaraykupas segurochu.
I never noticed this	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa repararqanichu
He did very well though.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa ichaqa.
I don't know how you do it, but it doesn't matter.	Manam yachanichu imayna ruwasqaykita, ichaqa manam imananpaschu.
He wanted to help her in any way he could.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinam yanapayta munarqa.
But obviously someone was scared.	Ichaqa sut’inmi pipas mancharisqa kasharqan.
I didn’t want to see what would happen next	Manam qawayta munarqanichu chaymanta imakuna pasananta
He made things happen.	Paymi imakunatapas ruwarqan.
I didn’t want to give up	Manam saqiyta munarqanichu
I couldn't believe how quickly things happened.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chaylla imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
I would love to see you do it again	Anchatan munarqani hukmanta chayta ruwasqaykita rikuyta
He was lucky to be able to sleep.	Payqa suerteyoqmi kasqa puñuyta atisqanmanta.
I don't believe that	Chaytaqa manam creenichu
I feel kind of surprised	Imayna admirasqa hinam tarikuni
I felt a little funny about it.	Chaymantaqa huk chikan asikunapaq hinam tarikurqani.
I couldn’t sleep there	Manam chaypiqa puñuyta atiymanchu karqa
I agree with you about that.	Chayna kasqanmantam qanwan acuerdopi kani.
I am so proud of him.	Anchatan paymanta orgulloso kani.
I don't know how long it will take.	Manam yachanichu hayka tiempopi kananta.
But there is clearly a serious problem.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kashan hatun sasachakuy.
I didn’t think much of it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu chaypi yuyaykurqani
Don’t forget that.	Chaytaqa ama qunqaychu.
You won’t have to do much.	Manan anchatachu ruwanayki kanqa.
He talks about it all the time.	Chaymantaqa sapa kutim rimachkan.
I feel like such a fool	Chayna mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikuni
Without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa.
I've heard so much about you.	Anchatam uyarirqani qammanta.
The man is a stranger.	Chay runaqa mana riqsisqa runam.
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq
He’s the one I like.	Paymi gustan.
I don’t think that’s true	Manam chay chiqap kasqanmantaqa piensanichu
I want to see him again.	Hukmanta payta rikuyta munani.
There was always more.	Sapa kutim aswan achka karqa.
Really, alone.	Chiqamanta, sapallan.
I never listened to it much	Manam haykapipas anchatachu uyarirqani
That doesn’t seem right.	Chayqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
I couldn’t be with him	Manam paywan kayta atirqanichu
He knew he didn’t mean it to be that way.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chay hina kananpaqchu yuyaykusqanmanta.
He did it in a remarkable way.	Admirakuypaqmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
I wonder where he is now	Kunanqa maypi kasqanmantam tapukuni
I have been here before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim karqani.
It’s not always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna kan.
He was scared now.	Payqa kunanmi mancharisqa.
They seemed surprised.	Chaywanqa admirasqa hinam karqaku.
I was busy.	Ñuqaqa ocupasqa karqani.
I didn’t want that	Manam munarqanichu chaytaqa
To prevent it from happening.	Mana chayna kananpaq.
But there is no future there.	Ichaqa manan chaypiqa hamuq tiempo kanchu.
He’s a you know what.	Payqa huk yachanki imata.
I thought long and hard about that	Chaypin unayta sinchita yuyaykurqani
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Paqarinmi achka ruwanay kachkan
That’s what he needs.	Chaytaqa necesitan.
Follow the instructions.	Nisqanman hina ruway.
I can't believe it's mine	Manam creeyta atinichu ñuqapa kasqanmantaqa
This way it will be better.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
A lot, actually.	Achka, chiqaptaqa.
I can’t really say what it is	Manam chiqaptachu niyta atiyman ima kasqanmantaqa
It’s actually really nice here.	Chiqaptaqa kaypiqa chiqap sumaqmi.
He didn’t want those things.	Payqa manan chaykunataqa munarqanchu.
I wonder if it’s worth it	Tapukuni sichus allinchu kanman
Who.	Pi.
Here’s what you can do .	Kaypim imata ruwawaq .
This would be too fast.	Kayqa llumpay utqaylla kanman.
Repeat a few times.	Iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
That’s a stranger	Chayqa mana riqsisqa runam
Now anything goes.	Kunanqa imapas rin.
I never saw him want anything like that	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chaynata imatapas munasqanmanta
I don’t remember who he was.	Manam yuyarinichu pi kasqanmanta.
The future is secure, so it’s yours	Hamuq pacha seguro, chaymi qanpa kan
I couldn’t understand it.	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu.
I didn't think it would be that hard	Manam piensarqanichu chayna sasa kananta
I would like to see it one day	Munaymanmi huk punchaw qawayta
They were very happy.	Ancha kusisqam karqaku.
In fact, it looked great today.	Chiqaptaqa, kunan punchawqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
I wouldn’t have done it	Manam ruwaymanchu karqa
Now, do that.	Kunanqa, chayta ruway.
But he didn't have to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwananchu karqan.
So here it goes.	Chaymi kaypi rin.
That is the reality.	Chayqa chiqap kaqmi.
I really didn't want to do anything else in this process, anyway	Chiqaptaqa manam huk ruwayta munarqanichu kay ruwaypi, imayna kaptinpas
It might be big and ugly.	Yaqapaschá hatun hinaspa millay kanman.
Man must do what man must do.	Runaqa imatachus runa ruwanan tiyan chayta ruwanan tiyan.
That may not be a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu.
I wanted to go to school	Yachay wasiman riyta munarqani
I hear it but it makes no sense	Uyarini ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu
I knew he was probably tired	Yacharqanim yaqapaschá sayk’usqa kasqanmanta
I can’t be there anymore	Manañam chaypi kayta atiymanchu
I was a new person.	Musuq runam karqani.
I did it very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam chaytaqa ruwarqani.
The first day.	Ñawpaq punchaw.
I couldn’t fix him	Manam paytaqa allichayta atirqanichu
So all of this will happen this year	Chaymi tukuy kaykunaqa kay wata kanqa
I didn’t think you could do this.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
You can't answer that.	Chaytaqa manam kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
I saw him for the first time last night	Qayna tutam paytaqa puntata rikurqani
I want to work.	Llamkayta munani.
I want her to be happy with me	Munani ñuqawan kusisqa kananta
But that is not a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa mana allinchu.
I’m not exactly stupid	Manam allintachu sonso kani
I know that immediately	Chaytaqa chayllam yachani
I just saw him recently	Chayllaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani
I didn’t know exactly	Manam allintachu yacharqani
But there will never be a reason.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu imaraykupas.
I don't want to do anything fancy here	Kaypiqa manam ima sumaq ruwaytapas ruwayta munanichu
This is the process.	Kaymi chay ruwayqa.
I think it was a mistake.	Pantasqa kasqanmantam piensani.
I didn’t know about it	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
I was anything but, really	Ñuqaqa imapas karqani ichaqa, chiqaptapuni
It should be a great year.	Hatun wata kanan.
He thought he was bigger than her.	Paymanta aswan hatun kasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
I’ll be in a good mood	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kasaq
I just don’t know everything yet	Chayllaraqmi manaraq tukuy imata yachanichu
This isn’t going to be a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanqa.
I know how tired you are	Yachanim imayna sayk’usqa kasqaykita
I couldn’t leave, not yet	Manam ripuyta atirqanichu, manaraqmi
It’s not going to be real.	Manam chiqap hinachu kanqa.
I don't know who he is anymore	Manañam yachanichu pi kasqanmanta
You do what you have to do.	Imatachus ruwanayki kanqa chaytan ruwanki.
I have been waiting for a very long time	Ancha unayñam suyachkani
Maybe it was very good.	Ichapas ancha allin karqa.
I really want something new	Chiqamanta musuq kaqta munani
Maybe he wasn’t a tomorrow man.	Ichapas mana paqarin runachu karqa.
I haven’t been here in a long time	Unayñan mana kaypichu kashani
He didn't know how he hadn't noticed before.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatas ñawpaqta mana repararqanchu chayta.
Why isn’t it very good.	Imaraykutaq mana ancha allinchu.
But it’s certainly a bad thing to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin ruway.
I know that sounds silly to you, maybe	Yachanim chayqa qampaq mana yuyayniyuq hina uyarikun, ichapas
I haven’t seen him in a long time now	Kunanqa unayñan mana paytaqa rikunichu
He didn’t always do that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chayta ruwaq.
I don’t know his name	Manam sutinta yachanichu
And this process was just that.	Hinaspa kay ruwayqa chaylla karqan.
It was a seriously great year.	Serio hatun wata karqan.
I didn’t want to talk about this	Manam kaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu
He did his best.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
Good people.	Allin runakuna.
I couldn’t stand it anymore	Manañam aguantayta atirqanichu
I thought everything was better	Tukuy imapas aswan allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
Which was great, great.	Imataq ancha sumaq karqa, ancha sumaq.
I didn't mean anything by that	Chaywanqa manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu
I'll do this	Kayta ruwasaq
It was really bad.	Chiqaptam millay karqa.
I really look forward to that.	Chiqaptam chaytaqa suyachkani.
But this is not true.	Ichaqa kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I really want him to be a good person	Anchatan munani allin runa kananta
But tonight, this last time, he had to.	Ichaqa kunan tutan, kay qhepa kutipi, ruwanan karqan.
I want to ignore everything	Tukuy imata mana uyariyta munani
I’m a good guy. 	Allin runam kani. 
But about once a week, that will be fine.	Ichaqa semanapi huk kutita hina, chayqa allinmi kanqa.
I never get an answer.	Manam haykapipas kutichiyta tarinichu.
I really didn’t know that	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa yacharqanichu
There is a large building there.	Chaypin kan huk hatun wasi.
As always, everything looked strange.	Sapa kuti hinam tukuy imapas mana riqsisqa rikchakurqa.
I didn't know this before but it made perfect sense	Kaytaqa manam ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanichu ichaqa allintam yuyayniyuq karqa
I can’t wait any longer	Manañam suyayta atinichu
Everyone was very happy.	Lliwmi ancha kusisqa karqaku.
He’s there now.	Payqa kunan chaypi kachkan.
But, she was extremely nice.	Ichaqa, payqa sinchi sumaqmi karqan.
I know you are so disappointed	Yachanim chayna hukmanyasqa kasqaykita
That’s some baby.	Chayqa wakin wawa.
That will be easy for you.	Chayqa facilmi kanqa qampaq.
Instead, it’s doing something else	Aswanpas hukta ruwaymi
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
I was happy with that	Chaywanmi kusisqa karqani
I want to understand who this person is	Kay runa pi kasqanmanta entiendeyta munani
I had no idea how many there were	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani hayka kasqanmantaqa
I think they were scared more than anything	Yuyaykuni imamantapas aswan mancharisqa kasqankuta
I knew where he was going	Yacharqanim mayman risqanmanta
But he wasn’t there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu kasharqan.
It’s not too bad.	Manam ancha mana allinchu.
I feel better now.	Kunanqa allinmi sientekuni.
I still couldn't answer	Kunankamapas manam kutichiyta atirqanichu
I knew he had strong feelings for me	Yacharqanim ñuqapaq sinchi sientekusqanmanta
Certainly this time.	Chiqamanta kay kutipi.
You can’t be him.	Manan pay kayta atiwaqchu.
I don't feel comfortable with that.	Chaywanqa manam allintachu tarikuni.
I can’t do that yet.	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I think it will be good	Allinmi kanqa nispaymi piensani
You want to get that answer right.	Chay kutichiyta allinta tariyta munanki.
I wasn't supposed to be here	Manam kaypichu kanay karqa
Once installed.	Huk kutilla churasqa.
It's obviously not good enough.	Sut'inmi mana allinchu.
There was nothing really	Manam imapas karqachu chiqaptaqa
I couldn’t remember anything	Manam imatapas yuyariyta atirqanichu
I knew no one would be	Yacharqanim mana pipas kananta
Twenty years or more.	Iskay chunka wata utaq aswan.
I’m always tired, so tired	Sapa kutim sayk’usqa kani, chayna sayk’usqa
I know it took a lot of time	Yachanim achka tiempota pasasqanmanta
And that he doesn’t.	Hinaspa chayta payqa mana.
They are human beings.	Paykunaqa runakunam.
So it seems to be a good thing.	Chaymi allinpaq rikchakun.
I think that's what this is.	Chayqa kayqa kasqanmantam piensani.
He died three years later.	Payqa kinsa wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I’m really sick.	Chiqamanta unqusqa kachkani.
I can't remember when	Manam yuyariyta atinichu haykapi
I still don't know why	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta
They are not ready.	Paykunaqa manan listochu kashanku.
I can catch up later	Qhepamanmi chayayta atiyman
I never got to talk to him about it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa paywan rimayta atirqanichu
Isn't anyone very happy about it.	Manachu pipas ancha kusisqa chaymanta.
I didn’t want to anymore	Manañam munarqanichu
I didn’t want to know	Manam yachayta munarqanichu
Happy birthday.	Kusisqa punchaw.
You never know where you might hear something.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu maypi imatapas uyariyta atisqaykita.
I could never get over it again.	Manaña hayk’aqpas chayta atipayta atirqanichu.
I don't believe it will happen	Manam creenichu chayna kananta
I don’t know how to fix it.	Manam yachanichu imayna allichayta.
He thought it was fine.	Payqa allinmi nispan yuyaykurqan.
I knew you were good	Yacharqanim allin kasqaykita
A man in solitary confinement	Huk runa sapallan carcelpi
Great man, he said.	Hatun runa, nispas nisqa.
I’ll be happy to do that!.	¡Kusisqam chayta ruwasaq!.
He wanted to do no more than that.	Payqa manan chaymanta aswan ruwaytaqa munarqanchu.
I was there all the time	Tukuy tiempo chaypi karqani
If this is true.	Sichus kay cheqaq kanman chayqa.
So it would be nice.	Chaymi sumaq kanman.
Do something that matters.	Imapas importante kaqta ruway.
I want to hear from him	Paymanta uyariyta munani
I wish I could do that today	Munaymanmi kunan punchaw chayta ruwayta
I can catch up later.	Qhepamanmi chayayta atiyman.
He has to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan tiyan.
That stuff is amazing.	Chay imapas admirakuypaqmi.
I never knew that was the case	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t know how to respond	Manam imayna kutichiyta yacharqanichu
I can't imagine this	Kaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I am happy with that	Chaywanmi kusisqa kachkani
Then again, maybe not.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas mana.
I don't know why this happened.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kay pasasqanmanta.
He usually did that.	Yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa ruwaq.
That was pretty stupid.	Chayqa ancha sonso kaymi karqa.
He seemed very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam karqa.
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Yacharqanim ancha sasa kananta
Not like it used to be.	Mana ñawpaqpi hinachu.
I don’t know why he did that.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wasn’t a very nice person	Manam ancha sumaq runachu karqani
I still think so today.	Kunankamapas chaytam piensani.
I can't talk to anyone now.	Kunanqa manam piwanpas rimayta atiymanchu.
Next week has something for you for sure.	Hamuq semanapi imapas qampaq kanqa seguro.
I just didn’t see it work	Chaylla mana llamk’ayta rikurqanichu
He looked closely to see why.	Payqa allintan qhawarirqan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta yachananpaq.
It’s a big big deal.	Hatunmi hatun.
I know it will happen someday	Yachanim haykapipas chayna kananta
I couldn’t eat proper food for a week.	Huk semanan mana allin mikhunata mikhuyta atirqanichu.
You are the best.	Qamqa aswan allinqa kanki.
I can't do it faster	Manam aswan utqaylla ruwayta atiymanchu
It was never quite right.	Manam haykapipas allintachu karqa.
But most of the time it's funny.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim asikunapaq hina.
But someone else has to do it.	Ichaqa huk runam ruwanan.
He thought he must be mad.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi loco kananta.
No, there was one thing.	Manan, huk kaqmi karqan.
I have nothing to keep me busy.	Manam imapas kanchu ocupasqa kanaypaq.

Do what you think is right.	Allinta yuyaykusqaykita ruway.
Okay, well a little bit.	Allinmi, allinmi huk chikan.
Two people were seriously injured.	Iskay runakuna sinchita k’irisqa.
There are some things you can do.	Kanmi wakin ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq.
He might be the one.	Paymi kanman.
I still can't wait to talk to you every day	Kunankamapas manam suyayta atinichu sapa punchaw qamwan rimanaypaq
He speaks well.	Payqa allintam riman.
I know what this is about.	Yachanim imamanta kayqa rimachkan.
I have wished so many times	Chaynatam achka kutita munarqani
I did, a lot of it.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, achkata.
It would be very easy.	Ancha facilmi kanman.
I didn’t think it was coming	Manam yuyaykurqanichu hamunanta
But I saw a lot of him today	Ichaqa kunan p’unchaymi askha payta rikurqani
I couldn’t stay here any longer	Manañan kaypi qhepakuyta atirqanichu
I really didn't think about it	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypiqa piensarqanichu
I hope to see you one day	Suyachkani huk punchaw qawayta
Everything was there.	Tukuy imapas karqa.
You know, man.	Yachanki, runa.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ichaqa chayna hinam pasarqa.
I am a real people person.	Chiqap runakuna runam kani.
No, he didn’t want to talk.	Manan, payqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
I certainly know who you are	Cheqaqtapunin yachani pi kasqaykita
I mean this in a positive way.	Kaytaqa allintam niyta munani.
And this is something.	Hinaspa kayqa imapas.
There is nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu.
I hardly ever feel comfortable doing it	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas chayta ruwaspaqa allintachu tarikuni
He now knows what he does on a daily basis.	Payqa kunanmi yachan ima ruwasqanmanta sapa punchaw.
I know he would love to talk to you	Yachanim payqa anchata munanman karqa qanwan rimayta
But it wasn’t a secret.	Ichaqa manan pakasqa hinachu karqan.
I really feel bad about it	Chiqaptam chaymantaqa mana allintachu sientekuni
I can’t think of anything else	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I don’t know what happened to him.	Manam yachanichu paywan ima pasasqanmanta.
The man looked up.	Chay runaqa qhawarisqa.
I wonder why he’s doing this	Tapukuni imanasqataq kayta ruwachkan nispa
No, it’s never been.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas.
But that was neither true nor correct.	Ichaqa chay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu nitaq allinchu karqan.
It was me, just me.	Ñuqam karqani, ñuqallam.
They were really good.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam allin karqaku.
Needless to say this is not good.	Manañam niyta munanichu kayqa manam allinchu.
I wanted to know things	Imakunatapas yachayta munarqani
I soon learned that it was	Pisi tiempollamantan yacharqani chayna kasqanmanta
Almost.	Yaqa.
But that’s what he said.	Ichaqa chaytan nirqan.
I wasn’t nearly so sure	Manam yaqa chayna segurochu karqani
What in the world could it be?.	¿Imataq kay pachapi kanman?.
Many big celebrities were here.	Achka hatun riqsisqa runakunam kaypi karqaku.
I just know it will happen one day	Chaylla yachani huk punchaw chayna kananta
Therein lies the problem.	Chaypim sasachakuy kachkan.
I felt a little sad today.	Kunan punchawmi huk chikan llakisqa tarikurqani.
I couldn’t see anything anymore	Manañam imatapas rikuyta atirqanichu
I could never really do it	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I can't understand that	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atiymanchu
He wants to make them better.	Chaykunataqa aswan allinta ruwayta munan.
There a few in there.	Chaypi huk iskay kimsa.
I don’t mean to say	Manam niyta munanichu
That’s been a long time.	Chayqa ancha unayñam.

I had no idea how beautiful it was	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani imayna sumaq kasqanmanta
I saw the story this morning	Kunan paqarinmi chay willakuyta rikurqani
I've never had a better idea	Manam haykapipas aswan allin yuyayniyuqchu karqani
I heard that over and over again	Chaytaqa sapa kutim uyarirqani
I can't do that again	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atiymanchu
I was quite surprised	Ñuqaqa allintam admirakurqani
That’s what I’ve been thinking about all the time	Chaypin sapa kutilla yuyaykurqani
I want to talk about this.	Kaymanta rimayta munani.
It was pretty cold.	Allin chiri kasqa.
You know.	Yachankim.
I can’t believe this will happen again	Mana creeyta atiymanchu kay hukmanta pasananta
I desperately wanted to sleep.	Sinchitan puñuyta munarqani.
I wanted to tell him he was sick	Unqusqa kasqanmantam willayta munarqani
Terrified of something.	Imamantapas llumpay mancharisqa.
He's never been here.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas kaypichu.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa munanki chayqa.
I hardly feel right now	Kunanqa yaqapaschá mana allintachu sientekuni
It’s too bad for me.	Llumpay mana allinmi ñuqapaq.
I don’t understand it, really.	Manam entiendenichu, chiqaptaqa.
Without it, there is nothing.	Mana kaptinqa, manam imapas kanchu.
I mean, that's obvious	Niyta munani, chayqa sut'inmi
I can’t find it	Manam tarinichu
I couldn’t eat or sleep or anything seemed to make sense	Manam mikhuyta nitaq puñuyta atirqanichu nitaq imapas imapaqpas hinachu karqan
I actually did it.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam ruwarqani.
Now nothing else.	Kunanqa manaña imapas yapamanta.
I have never seen or heard of it	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu nitaq uyarirqanichu
I didn’t want to wait	Manam suyayta munarqanichu
You know, you know.	Yachanki, yachanki.
You don’t know exactly how much.	Mana allintachu yachanki hayk’a kasqanmanta.
They weren’t really about anything.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu imamantapas karqanku.
I didn't know about this	Kaymantaqa manam yacharqanichu
I didn’t see who it was	Manam rikurqanichu pi kasqanmanta
However, there was no one.	Ichaqa, manan pipas karqanchu.
I want to do this job	Kay llamkayta ruwayta munani
I want better, but this isn't too bad	Aswan allintam munani, ichaqa kayqa manam ancha mana allinchu
Never never again.	Mana hayk’aqpas manaña hayk’aqpas.
If not, the day after that, or the day after that.	Mana chayqa, chaymanta qhipa p’unchaw, utaq chaymanta qhipa p’unchaw.
I didn’t want to talk	Manam rimayta munarqanichu
Now it doesn't matter.	Kunanqa manam imananpaschu.
I can’t do it	Manam atiymanchu
I couldn’t believe there were other people like me	Manam creeyta atirqanichu ñuqa hina huk runakuna kasqankuta
There were real people here.	Kaypiqa chiqap runakunam karqaku.
I didn’t think about it	Manam chaypiqa piensarqanichu
He felt right at home.	Wasipi hinam tarikurqa.
I didn't know who he was at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu pi kasqanmanta.
So nice a lot of people.	Chaymi sumaq achka runakuna.
I wanted to hear this first	Kayta ñawpaqta uyariyta munarqani
Hopefully there will be time for everything to work out	Munaymanmi tiempo kanman tukuy imapas allin kananpaq
But I’m a little later, I guess.	Ichaqa aswan qhepamanmi kashani, yaqapaschá.
I knew he could and would do it	Yacharqanim chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta hinaspa ruwananta
No one wants to help here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas yanapayta munanchu.
I was never going to be a sedentary person.	Manam haykapipas tiyaq runachu kanay karqa.
If not, it’s fine.	Mana chayqa, allinmi.
I just couldn’t sit still.	Chaylla mana tiyayta atirqanichu.
I knew what to say.	Yacharqanim ima niyta.
I always wanted to know	Sapa kutim yachayta munarqani
I knew it was too good	Yacharqanim llumpay allin kasqanmanta
I don’t know why not.	Mana yachanichu imarayku mana.
I would have done anything, he said.	Imatapas ruwayman karqan, nispas nin.
He has to be ready.	Payqa listo kananpaqmi.
And do you know what he says? 	Hinaspa, ¿yachankichu ima nisqanta?
But I had a lot to do tonight	Ichaqa kunan tutan askha ruwanay karqan
said.	nisqa.
He’s doing better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwashan.
I never wanted to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu.
Can’t say enough about it.	Mana allintachu chaymanta niyta atin.
I have been here before	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim karqani
I was in something	Imapipas karqani
I want to go with you	Qanwan kuska ripuyta munani
I’m sorry that happened.	Pampachaykuway chay pasasqanmanta.
It really is never that simple.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas chayna facilchu.
But things really aren't going well.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa manam allinchu kachkan.
All the best.	Llapan allin.
A known fact	Huk riqsisqa chiqap
It sure looked that way.	Seguro chayna rikchakurqa.
I doubt he’ll come back	Iskayrayani kutimunanta
I wonder what he wants this time.	Tapukuni imatataq kay kutipi munan.
I can’t hear anything, that’s all	Manam imatapas uyariyta atinichu, chaylla
We are always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna kanchik.
But he couldn’t fix this.	Ichaqa manan kayta allichayta atirqanchu.
That doesn’t seem too difficult.	Chayqa manan ancha sasachu rikch’akun.
I can't believe what has happened	Manam creeyta atinichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
I’ve never seen that before	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu
Didn't almost anyone live there.	Manachu yaqa pipas chaypi tiyaq.
I’m afraid it’s not much	Manchakuni mana ancha kasqanmanta
I couldn't stay sane all day	Tukuy punchawmi mana yuyayniyuq kayta atirqanichu
I knew what had to be done.	Yacharqanim ima ruwana kasqanmanta.
I didn't know that happened	Chay pasasqanmantaqa manam yacharqanichu
Which isn’t, isn’t it.	Imachus mana, manachu.
I don’t know about that.	Manam chaymantaqa yachanichu.
I know I learned things here every day	Yachani yacharqani imakunatapas kaypi sapa punchaw
There was a girl.	Huk sipasmi kasqa.
I knew that right away	Chaytaqa chayllam yacharqani
I didn’t know how young he was at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan yacharqanichu hayk’a wayna kasqanmanta
I doubt it will ever come back	Iskayrayani haykapipas kutimunanta
I had to be sober	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kanay karqa
That’s what I thought	Chaynatam piensarqani
He was barely acceptable.	Payqa yaqapaschá allinpaq qhawarisqa kasqa.
I can't imagine why.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I still want to take a chance	Hinallam munani huk oportunidadta hapiyta
I couldn’t get over it	Manam chaytaqa atipayta atirqanichu
He is certainly the best.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa aswan allinqa.
I couldn’t understand why that would happen	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imanasqa chayna kananta
But they were lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi karqanku.
I still didn’t really know what was going to happen next	Chay qhepaman imachus kananta manaraqmi allintachu yacharqani
And then again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta.
He’s injured.	K’irisqa kachkan.
You were very, very happy about it.	Ancha, ancha kusisqam karqanki chaymanta.
He certainly didn’t need to tell anyone now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa mana pimanpas willayta necesitarqanchu.
Therefore , the	Chayraykum .
Fortunately, there is something better.	Ancha kusisqa, aswan allin kaqmi kan.
I very nearly didn’t	Ancha yaqa mana ruwarqanichu
I’d be sad that it happened, what a great guy.	Llakisqa kayman pasasqanmanta, ima hatun runa.
That was a great experience	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa
I don’t think he’s worth it	Ñoqaqa manam piensanichu paytaqa allinpaq hina kasqanta
I went right away.	Chayllam rirqani.
Every single day.	Sapa sapa punchaw.
The fresher the food, the better.	Aswan musuq mikhuy kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
I still don’t understand	Kunankamapas manam entiendenichu
Here and there, everywhere.	Kaypi chaypi, maypipas.
I want to be like that	Chayna kaytam munani
No, actually, that's not quite right.	Manan, chiqaptaqa, chayqa manam allintachu.
Something big and effective.	Imapas hatun hinaspa allin ruwaq.
So this is important, if true.	Chaymi kayqa ancha allin, chiqap kaptinqa.
Both were good people.	Iskayninkum allin runa karqaku.
I can’t stand it	Manam aguantayta atinichu
That was a remarkable experience	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa
I didn't know what time it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima hora kasqanmantaqa
He said he was ‘one’.	Payqa ‘huk’ kasqanmantan nirqan.
That was a year and a half ago.	Chayqa karqa wata kuskan ñawpaqtaraqmi.
It should be funny.	Asikunapaq hinam kanan.
I can make this work.	Kay llamk’ayta ruwayta atiyman.
I didn’t really want to see or talk to anyone	Manam chiqaptachu pitapas qawayta nitaq rimayta munarqani
I didn’t want to be alone	Manam sapallay kayta munarqanichu
And a nicer house.	Hinaspa aswan sumaq wasi.
I thought no one would be there	Yuyarqanim mana pipas chaypi kananta
I haven’t seen him in a long time.	Unayñan mana rikurqanichu.
I never knew what it was	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
I would be happy if that were the case	Chayna kaptinqa kusisqam kayman
But it was a tragedy.	Ichaqa huk llakikuypaqmi karqan.
If you don’t, that’s fine.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
I couldn’t remember him	Manam paytaqa yuyariyta atirqanichu
I knew there was more to it than that	Yacharqanim chaymanta aswan achka kasqanmanta
I couldn’t walk for a while	Huk tiempon mana puriyta atirqanichu
I was very much there.	Ancha chaypim karqani.
Kind of like me.	Imayna ñuqa hina.
That was quick.	Chayqa utqayllam karqa.
I am still here today.	Kunankamapas kaypim kachkani.
I know this moment is right.	Yachanim kay rato allin kasqanmanta.
I didn’t really know what to do	Manam allintachu yacharqani imata ruwanaypaq
That’s just like you.	Chayqa qam hinam.
I wish he was here now	Munaymanmi kunan kaypi kananta
That’s what it says here.	Chaytan kaypi nin.
That's a lot of people involved.	Chayqa achka runakunam chaypi kachkanku.
I knew what they were	Yacharqanim ima kasqankuta
He didn’t know she was angry.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
I knew it would be there	Yacharqanim chaypi kananta
I couldn’t be that person anymore	Manañam chay runa kayta atirqanichu
I couldn’t do that	Manam chaynataqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I don’t intend to quit	Manam saqiyta yuyaykunichu
I did something really bad to you	Chiqap mana allintam ruwarqani qamwan
It was good to be home.	Allinmi karqa wasipi kayqa.
No one knows his name.	Manan pipas sutinta yachanchu.
No, he couldn’t believe it.	Manan, manan chaytaqa creeyta atirqanchu.
I have never seen anything like it	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa rikurqanichu
I still think it is.	Kunankamapas chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I wouldn’t have done that	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa
He went faster.	Payqa aswan utqayllam rirqa.
So he wants to help as much as he can.	Chaymi payqa atisqanman hina yanapayta munan.
He’s very.	Payqa ancha.
He hasn't been here in a long time.	Unayñam mana kaypichu kachkan.
Here it is now.	Kaypi kunanmi kachkan.
He was arrested.	Payqa hap’isqa karqan.
Let's wait.	Suyasun.
I'm not sure it's right.	Manam segurochu kani allin kasqanmantaqa.
So he went away.	Chaymi payqa rirqa.
You don't know this.	Kaytaqa manam yachankichu.
That’s you, guys.	Chayqa qanmi.
He will succeed in the future.	Qhepamanmi allinta ruwanqa.
There was probably nothing he could do.	Manachá ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
You know it right.	Allintam yachanki.
I think he wants to leave.	Yuyaykuni ripuyta munan.
That is not the case today.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Allintam yacharqani imakuna pasananta
Who does that.	Pitaq chayta ruwan.
I really wish he was here now	Chiqaptam munani kunan kaypi kananta
I couldn’t let that go	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu
But perhaps this is too soon.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa llumpay utqaylla.
That’s probably a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá allin kanman.
I had no idea he was rich	Manam yuyaykurqanichu qhapaq kasqanmanta
She is afraid to ask him what is wrong.	Payqa manchakunmi ima mana allin kasqanmanta tapuyta.
I would love to hear from you!.	¡Anchatan munani qanmanta uyariyta!.
They’re right there.	Paykunaqa chaypim kachkanku.
I know what needs to be done	Yachanim ima ruwana kasqanmanta
Today I wanted to find an answer	Kunan punchawmi kutichiyta tariyta munarqani
People like me.	Ñoqa hina runakuna.
I really want that to happen	Chiqaptam munani chayna kananta
I can't quite agree with that	Chaywanqa manam allintachu acuerdopi kayta atiyman
I really couldn’t stop eating	Chiqamanta mana mikhuyta saqiyta atirqanichu
I don’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikunichu.
I had no idea anything could be this bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas kayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
Tell it three times.	Kimsa kutita willay.
I don't understand why he wants to do this.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kayta ruwayta munasqanmanta.
I didn’t really want to be alone	Manam chiqaptachu sapallay kayta munarqani
We can’t afford it.	Manam atichwanchu.
That’s a good thing you’re doing.	Chayqa allintam ruwanki.
You are a human being like me.	Qamqa ñuqa hina runam kanki.
I'd be nice.	Sumaqmi kayman.
I really didn’t want to be here anymore	Chiqaptaqa manañam kaypi kayta munarqanichu
I just didn’t know what to do	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq
I can't wait to do this	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa manam suyayta atinichu
Maybe he said something.	Ichapas imatapas nirqa.
I know that he did	Yachanim chayna ruwasqanmanta
I thought about it first	Ñawpaqtaqa chaypi yuyaykurqani
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
I wasn’t really hungry	Manam chiqaptachu yarqaymanta karqani
They are there.	Chaypim kachkanku.
I knew exactly what it was	Allintam yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
I couldn’t really agree	Manam chiqaptaqa acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu
But it's just set up.	Ichaqa chayllam churasqa kachkan.
I can’t believe it	Manam creeyta atiymanchu
I won’t do that to him	Manam paytaqa chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
I never knew his name.	Manam haykapipas sutinta yacharqanichu.
He had been unable to sleep for nearly two years.	Yaqa iskay watañam mana puñuyta atirqachu.
I couldn't do anything about them.	Chaykunataqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
It doesn’t matter, he says.	Manam imananpaschu, nispas nin.
I know you won't be angry	Yachanim mana phiñasqa kanaykita
That’s how I got this injury	Chaynatam kay k’irisqa kani
This was a very long time ago.	Kayqa ancha unayñam karqa.
I never saw him before	Manam haykapipas paytaqa rikurqanichu
It’s really up to you.	Cheqaqtapunin qanmanta kanqa.
I couldn’t let this happen	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
He was angry now.	Payqa kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.
I don’t know what’s going to happen this year.	Manam yachanichu kay wata ima kananta.
You don’t do anything very happy.	Manan ancha kusisqachu imatapas ruwanki.
Yes, very happy.	Arí, ancha kusisqa.
He is such a great guy.	Payqa chayna hatun runam.
Very scared.	Ancha mancharisqa.
I'm doing it wrong, but I don't know exactly where.	Mana allintam ruwachkani, ichaqa manam allintachu yachani maypi.
He will be happy.	Payqa kusisqam kanqa.
I don’t feel comfortable	Manam allintachu sientekuni
He said he would be gone for a week, maybe longer.	Nisqa huk semana manaña kanqachu, ichapas aswan unayta.
He really wanted to know her name.	Payqa anchatan munarqan sutinta yachayta.
Very good, very good.	Ancha allin, ancha.
I never thought of that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanichu
But no, this is the best.	Ichaqa manan, kaymi aswan allinqa.
I don’t see why not.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa mana.
One thing another day, one thing another.	Huk kaq huk punchaw, huk kaq huk.
I hadn’t heard it in so long	Chayna unayñam mana uyarirqanichu
Alright !.	Allinmi !.
I’ve heard it before	Ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanim
He doesn’t know yet.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu.
I wish you were here	Munaymanmi kaypi kasqaykita
He was very excited about it.	Payqa anchatam chaymanta kusisqa tarikurqa.
So he couldn’t find it.	Chayraykum mana tariyta atirqachu.
I know how to fix this	Kayta imayna allichayta yachani
I didn’t want to be this anymore	Manañam kayta munarqanichu
It can’t be the only thing.	Manam chayllachu kanman.
Yes, the people here want to be here badly.	Arí, kaypi kaq runakunaqa mana allintam kaypi kayta munanku.
A few months ago, he would have	Iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaqa, chayta ruwanman karqa
I still won't do that.	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
I did it recently too.	Ñoqapas chayllaraqmi ruwarqani.
Do this once or twice a week.	Chaytaqa semanapi huk kutita iskay kutita ruway.
It can’t be that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu kanman.
Who knows what he was thinking.	Pi yachan ima piensasqanmanta.
But then again, maybe not.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas mana.
A wonderful man indeed	Huk sumaq runa chiqaptapuni
So he did it for me.	Chaymi ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
He was very much like me.	Payqa anchatan ñoqa hina karqan.
I never did anything like him	Manam haykapipas pay hinaqa imatapas ruwarqanichu
Now it was almost twice as big.	Kunanqa yaqa iskay kuti aswan hatunmi kasqa.
This is no longer the best.	Kayqa manañam aswan allinchu.
When it is true, something must be done and done quickly.	Chiqap kaptinqa imatapas utqayllam ruwana hinaspa ruwana.
I have to do that one day	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi ruwanay
I couldn’t tell you yet	Manaraqmi willayta atirqanichu
It’s that simple.	Chay hina facilmi.
They don’t care how or where it is.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu imaynatachus nitaq maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I want to be sure of that.	Chayta seguro kaytam munani.
I wonder what ever happened to him?.	Tapukuni, ¿imataq haykapipas paywan pasarqa?.
I'm really looking forward to next weekend	Chiqaptam suyachkani hamuq semana tukuyta
Maybe it’s something very serious.	Ichapas ancha hatun imapas kanman.
There is a bit more to do.	Kanmi huk chikan aswan ruwanapaq.
I was pretty sure it was	Yaqapaschá seguro karqani chayna kasqanmanta
I thought it was really nice	Chiqamanta sumaq kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani
This isn’t just me.	Kayqa manam ñuqallachu.
It looks black.	Yana rikchakun.
It's too good to be true.	Ancha allinmi mana chiqap kananpaq.
Or the action.	Utaq chay ruway.
I don’t know how serious it is.	Mana yachanichu imayna serio kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t go to school	Manam yachay wasiman riyta atirqanichu
I’m fine with that.	Mana chaywanqa allinmi kachkani.
I couldn’t help but know why	Manam mana yachayta atirqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa
I never thought of that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa piensarqanichu.
I was happy to be with him	Kusisqam karqani paywan kuska kasqaymanta
It was the only right thing to do.	Chaylla allin ruwayqa karqa.
I have no idea what happened to him	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
This is ultimately useful.	Kayqa qhepamanmi allin.
Something like innocence	Imapas mana huchayoq kay hina
Probably twenty years older than him.	Yaqapaschá paymanta iskay chunka wata kuraq.
I’m always tired	Sapa kutim sayk’usqa tarikuni
He is a stranger.	Payqa huk mana riqsisqa runam.
I wasn’t sure it would always happen.	Manam segurochu karqani sapa kuti chayna kananta.
I will always be early	Sapa kutim temprano kasaq
I have no choice but to disbelieve them	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu chaykunataqa mana creeyta atiymanchu
You are a good person.	Qamqa allin runam kanki.
I can’t wait to hear from you.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu qammanta uyariyta.
This was ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
They know the only way.	Chaylla ñanta yachanku.
I hear it looks really nice	Uyarini chiqap sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta
I don't believe that.	Manam chaynataqa creenichu.
I am ready to be outside all day every day	Sapa punchawmi tukuy punchaw hawapi kanaypaq listo kachkani
I wanted to turn back time	Tiempota qhepaman kutichiyta munarqani
I was a human being	Huk runam karqani
It’s a very difficult thing to do.	Ancha sasa ruwaymi.
Not at all.	Mana aswanpas.
Tell me what you think about it.	Willaway chaymanta ima yuyaykusqaykita.
I have to be with him right now.	Kunanpacha paywan kanay tiyan.
Not like himself.	Mana pay kikin hinachu.
Clearly, this is no longer the case.	Sut’inmi kashan manaña chay hinachu.
I know you can do better	Yachanim aswan allinta ruwayta atisqaykita
I know you are not.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqaykita.
We had to do this all the time	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanayku karqa
I have seen this too many times.	Kaytaqa ancha achka kutitam rikurqani.
He knew what it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima kasqanmanta.
I have no idea why he's here	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku kaypi kasqanmanta
He will do it quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanqa.
I still haven't seen anything	Kunankamapas manam imatapas rikurqanichu
I didn’t know if it would be good one day	Manam yacharqanichu huk punchaw allin kanman icha manachu chayta
I wasn’t ready for you.	Manam qampaq listochu karqani.
I don't think he did very well.	Manam piensanichu ancha allin ruwasqanmanta.
Not again, man.	Mana yapamanta runa.
Say three days.	Kimsa punchaw niy.
But it’s not quite yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allintachu.
Where is he at?	Maypitaq payqa kachkan.
It’s going to be cold.	Chiri kanqa.
Maybe he could do it now.	Ichapas kunanqa ruwayta atinman karqa.
It would be ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam kanman.
He says nothing happened.	Payqa ninmi mana imapas pasasqanmanta.
I know you are not unreasonable	Yachanim mana mana yuyayniyuq kasqaykita
Nothing to do with it.	Mana ima ruwanapaq.
One of them stood out.	Hukninmi aswan riqsisqa karqa.
I didn’t mean it that well	Manam chaynataqa allintachu niyta munarqani
I’ll make the time.	Tiempotan ruwasaq.
I didn’t know why	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I know what he has done	Yachanim imakuna ruwasqanmanta
So it had to be that way.	Chaymi chayna kanan karqa.
I knew you were right	Yacharqanim allinta nisqaykita
It could be the worst thing.	Aswan mana allin kaqmi kanman.
I still wasn’t quite sure.	Manaraqmi allintachu seguro karqani kunankamapas.
It was a very large one.	Ancha hatunmi karqa.
It was a hard reality.	Chayqa sasa cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Even so, you never know.	Chayna kaptinpas manam haykapipas yachankichu.
He was here early.	Payqa temprano kaypi kasqa.
So he was the one.	Chaymi payqa karqan.
I really can't remember	Chiqaptaqa manam yuyariyta atinichu
I mean, of course not	Niyta munani, chiqamanta mana
I’ve wanted to tell you that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan willayta munarqani.
Good night, now.	Allin tuta, kunan.
I wanted to get a good look at it	Chaytaqa allintam qawayta munarqani
It’s better to go.	Aswan allinmi riy.
I wasn’t really sure.	Manam chiqaptachu seguro karqani.
It was about ten or thirty.	Chunka kimsa chunka hinam karqa.
Nothing too much.	Mana imapas llumpay.
We have a few ideas.	Iskay kimsa yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I hope you can be sure of that.	Suyachkani chaymanta seguro kanaykita.
I would have liked to have seen him	Munaymanmi karqan payta rikuyta
But this is a little easier.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan pisi facilmi.
I will be a teacher	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kasaq
He died an hour later.	Huk hora qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
He was supposed to be.	Paymi kanan karqa.
I didn’t hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyarirqanichu.
I know he was glad he wasn't alone	Yachanim mana sapallan kasqanmanta kusisqa kasqanmanta
That’s the thing you learned to do.	Chayqa chay ruwaymi yacharqanki ruwayta.
Sure, sure, it should be.	Seguro, seguro, chaymi kanan.
I think it is there now	Kunanqa chaypi kasqanmantam piensani
I did the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwarqani.
I couldn’t hold anything all night	Tukuy tutan mana imatapas hap’iyta atirqanichu
I think you’re not good enough	Yuyaykuni, mana allinchu kasqaykita
It wasn’t very good.	Mana ancha allinchu karqan.
I can’t be with you again	Manam hukmanta qanwan kayta atiymanchu
They were excellent.	Paykunaqa ancha allinmi karqaku.
I just made a cup of coffee	Chayllaraqmi huk kukata ruwarqani
But no one could find him.	Ichaqa manan pipas tariyta atirqanchu.
I haven’t been like that in a long time.	Unayñan mana chay hinachu kani.
But then, maybe he did.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
I don't understand what's going on here	Manam entiendenichu kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta
This man was an older man.	Kay runaqa kuraq kasqa.
I didn’t know what to say	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta
And then there they were.	Hinaspa chaymanta chaypi karqanku.
He might just do it.	Payqa ichapas chayta ruwanman.
I thought it would be here	Yuyarqanim kaypi kananta
I didn’t know it was there	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta
I can do nothing for you today	Kunan punchawqa manam imatapas qampaq ruwaymanchu
It couldn’t be more true now.	Kunanqa manan aswan cheqaqchu kanman.
So, no I don’t think you did.	Chaymi, mana mana yuyanichu chayta ruwasqaykita.
Being a new person.	Musuq runa kay.
That’s not happy.	Chayqa manan kusisqachu.
I don't know if that's the problem.	Mana yachanichu chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I didn’t really think that	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa piensarqani
Everything was secondary.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaqmi karqa.
I want to look good.	Allin rikchayniyuq kaytam munani.
Please say OK for me to do this.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta ruwanaypaqqa allinmi niy.
Maybe that would have been the only thing.	Ichapas chaylla kanman karqa.
I really thought it was you	Chiqaptam piensarqani qam kasqaykita
I knew what you wanted to do	Yacharqanim ima ruway munasqaykita
I don’t know what you’re like	Manam riqsinichu imayna kasqaykita
The whole day was great.	Tukuy punchawmi ancha allin karqa.
That was a month ago.	Chayqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I could not believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu
You don’t know how to do it right.	Manan yachankichu allinta ruwayta.
It was such a great experience.	Chayna ancha allinmi karqa.
He was so sure tonight was going to be that night.	Payqa ancha segurom karqa kunan tuta chay tuta kananta.
I really don’t see how that could have happened.	Chiqamanta mana rikunichu imaynatachus chay kanman karqa.
It shouldn't take too long, maybe three days at the most.	Mana ancha unaytachu kanan, ichapas kimsa punchaw aswan achka.
I know what it is now	Yachanim kunan ima kasqanmanta
But this is the most important thing.	Ichaqa kaymi aswan allinqa.
Can't wait to come again.	Mana suyayta atinichu yapamanta hamuyta.
Last year it was cold.	Qayna wata chiri karqa.
I thought better of it	Aswan allintan chayta yuyaykurqani
That’s going to be very difficult.	Chayqa ancha sasa kanqa.
Now I want everything	Kunanqa tukuy imatam munani

You’re like him.	Pay hinam kanki.
I know you know this.	Yachanim kayta yachasqaykita.
Beautiful as always.	Sapa kuti hina sumaq.
I failed a few times	Iskay kinsa kutitan mana allintachu ruwarqani
Just don’t do it again.	Aswanpas ama hukmanta ruwaychu.
Now he realized why.	Kunanqa repararqanmi imarayku chayta.
We made it bigger than that.	Chaymanta aswan hatunmi ruwarqayku.
Obviously I’m excited about it	Sut’inmi chaymanta kusisqa kashani
Maybe he’s unsure.	Ichapas payqa mana segurochu kachkan.
That’s what he thought.	Chaytan payqa yuyaykurqan.
Perhaps you were seriously injured.	Ichapas sinchita k’irisqa karqanki.
It’s almost ridiculous.	Yaqa asikunapaq hinam.
I wanted to be like him	Pay hina kaytam munarqani
Like many people, I am afraid.	Achka runakuna hinam manchakuni.
I wonder who that could be	Tapukuni pitaq chay kanman chayta
I didn’t want to say anything	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu
So, there’s a lot to do.	Chaymi, achka ruwana.
I don't understand that	Chaytaqa manam entiendenichu
He meant it that way.	Payqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
I learn that later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi yachani.
This sounds great.	Kayqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
He was a black man.	Payqa yana runam karqa.
And that’s where it goes.	Hinaspa chaymi chayman rin.
A great beautiful stranger	Huk hatun sumaq mana riqsisqa runa
That’s what I meant.	Chaytan niyta munarqani.
I don't understand why	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
This may not always be the case.	Manapaschá sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
I certainly do that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwani.
I don't remember why it was true	Manam yuyarinichu imarayku chiqap kasqanmantaqa
It had been a very long time.	Ancha unayñam karqa.
Here is why not.	Kaypim kachkan imarayku mana chayna kasqanmanta.
Many people don’t.	Achka runakunam mana.
A month later he left.	Huk killa qhepamanmi ripurqan.
I just wasn’t sure about him yet.	Chayllaraqmi manaraq paymanta segurochu karqani.
I know he knows	Yachanim payqa yachasqanmanta
I never knew what happened	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu ima pasasqanmantaqa
That’s a.	Chayqa huk.
He was such a good guy.	Payqa chayna allin runam karqa.
There was nothing more important than this.	Kaymanta aswan importante ruwayqa manan karqanchu.
Please.	Ama hina.
I didn’t want to talk to you	Manam qamwan rimayta munarqanichu
I never knew if it was right or wrong	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu allin kasqanmanta mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I feel so much better now though	Kunanqa ancha allintam sientekuni ichaqa
One could do worse.	Huk runaqa aswan mana allintam ruwanman.
I'm going to go right.	Allintam risaq.
I don’t care what happened.	Manan imananpaschu imachus pasasqanmantaqa.
He couldn’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atirqanchu.
But he kept coming.	Ichaqa hinallam hamurqa.
I said that the other day	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi nirqani
A couple of them.	Huk iskay kimsa.
Have a nice day!.	Qampaq allin punchaw!.
Can't work for some reason.	Mana llamk'ayta atinchu imarayku.
I’m probably crazy	Yaqapaschá loco kani
It’s like two different people.	Iskay chikan runakuna hinam.
I wasn't sure how many	Manam segurochu karqani hayka kasqanmantaqa
I know what it is	Yachanim ima kasqanmantaqa
No, not very often.	Manan, manan ancha sapa kutichu.
I knew exactly who he was	Allintam yacharqani pi kasqanmanta
Man can’t help who they are.	Runaqa manan yanapayta atinchu pi kasqankuta.
I am not sure that this is a practice.	Manam allintachu yachani kay ruway kasqanmantaqa.
He is not like you.	Payqa manan qan hinachu.
Of course, there is none today.	Arí, kunan tiempopiqa manan kanchu.
I saw nothing, nothing yet	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu, manaraqmi imatapas
I can’t remember what it was	Manam yuyariyta atinichu ima kasqanmanta
Let’s hope it doesn’t work out.	Suyasun mana allin kananta.
He immediately said no.	Chayllam mana nispa nirqa.
It was wonderful for me too.	Ñuqapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I was pretty sure of that	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqani
What will he do.	Imatataq ruwanqa.
I think you can understand	Yuyaykuni entiendeyta atisqaykita
That’s what you mean.	Chaytaqa niyta munanki.
I don't know him	Manam paytaqa riqsinichu
I couldn't be sure which one it was	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu mayqin kasqanmantaqa
It could be a week, it could be two weeks.	Huk semanan kanman, iskay semanan kanman.
I think, actually, that was the right thing to do.	Yuyaykuni, chiqaptaqa, chaymi allin ruway karqa.
He's been there a long time, he said	Unayñan chaypi kashan, nispa
I wanted him to be with me all the time	Tukuy tiempon paywan kananta munarqani
But the next day is harder.	Ichaqa paqarin punchawmi aswan sasa.
He looked half hungry.	Payqa kuskan yarqasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Everyday weather.	Sapa punchaw pacha.
This is what he did.	Kaymi ruwarqa.
I don’t want to be sad	Manam munanichu llakisqa kayta
Maybe a world.	Ichapas huk pacha.
There is no point here	Kaypiqa manam imapaqpas kanchu
You know what he wants.	Yachankim ima munasqanmanta.
This was not the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kananta
I thought that was no no.	Chayqa mana mana kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Please, this time.	Ama hina kaspa, kay kutipi.
We need to keep doing it.	Chaypaqqa hinallam ruwananchik.
I feel like you know nothing	Mana imatapas yachasqaykita hinan sientekuni
It looked at him.	Chayqa payta qhawarisqa.
I felt sad for him.	Paymanta llakisqa tarikurqani.
I really feel it.	Chiqaptam sientekuni.
I do this every morning	Sapa paqarinmi chayta ruwani
I didn't know exactly where it was	Manam allintachu yacharqani maypi kasqanmantaqa
There was no one there that night.	Chay tutaqa manam pipas karqachu.
Today was the worst.	Kunan punchawmi aswan mana allin karqa.
I am very disappointed	Anchatam hukmanyasqa kachkani
And as it should be.	Hinaspa chayna kanan hina.
You tell me what you think.	Qanmi willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
Not sure if it is.	Mana segurochu kanchu chayna kaptinqa.
I need to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanay.
I was actually really worried	Chiqaptaqa chiqaptam llakisqa karqani
Like many people, I am afraid	Achka runakuna hinam manchakuni
There is no such thing today.	Kunanqa manan chay hinaqa kanchu.
But you’re the last one.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki qhepa kaq.
I couldn’t say it was good	Manam niyta atirqanichu allin kasqanmanta
But the fact remains.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi kashan.
You should have done that a long time ago.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwanayki karqan.
I’m coming home.	Wasiman hamuq kani.
I don't want to believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu
That’s really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi.
I didn't care if he was sad	Manam imananpaschu karqa llakisqa kaptinqa
Something about him seems familiar.	Paymanta imapas riqsisqa hinam.
I didn’t know why he did that	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaynata ruwasqanmanta
He had no reason to do so.	Payqa manan imaraykupas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
But it’s not quite there.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaypi kashan.
I've never done that, ever	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu, haykapipas
I was happy that day	Chay punchawmi kusisqa tarikurqani
Maybe it will be in the morning.	Ichapas tutamanta kanqa.
So if that much is true.	Chaymi chay achka chiqap kaptinqa.
Good guy.	Allin wayna.
I am doing well here	Kaypiqa allintam ruwachkani
I don't see where the problem is.	Manam rikunichu maypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Someone else did it	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa
We just did the work.	Chayllaraqmi llamkayta ruwarqayku.
I have no idea what he did there	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani chaypi ima ruwasqanmanta
This is the best way to do it.	Kaymi aswan allin ruwayqa.
I want to sleep a lot more	Aswan achkata puñuyta munani
I didn’t expect an answer.	Manam kutichiyta suyarqanichu.
Everything in the world, everything.	Kay pachapi tukuy ima, tukuy ima.
No, it’s easier this way.	Manan, kay hinaqa aswan facilmi.
I am beautiful in every way	Tukuy imapipas sumaqmi kani
The bigger it is than this, the better.	Kaymanta aswan hatun kaptinqa, aswan allinmi.
This he obviously can’t do.	Kaytaqa payqa sut’inmi mana ruwayta atinchu.
I never knew you existed	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kasqaykita
But you have to do it right now.	Ichaqa kunanmi allinta ruwanayki.
Not like a house.	Mana wasi hina.
I wonder if it’s okay	Allinchu kasqanmanta tapukuni
I did this last night	Kaytaqa qayna tutam ruwarqani
Tell me how you can do that.	Willaway imaynatas chayta ruwawaq chayta.
I never know how to say this	Manam haykapipas kayta niyta yachanichu
He wanted to solve the problem.	Chay sasachakuy allichayta munarqa.
I am more certain.	Ñuqaqa aswan segurom kani.
They are there now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi chaypi kachkanku.
I really really like him	Paytaqa anchatam anchata gustan
I’m glad it’s wrong.	Kusikuni mana allin kasqanmanta.
Yes, such a person.	Arí, chayna runa.
I never expected it to be so easy	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu chayna facil kananta
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning	Paqarin paqarinmi puntata ruwasaq
I cannot agree with that	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopi kayta atiymanchu
I'm glad it's good	Kusisqam tarikuni allin kasqanmanta
He does, however, do well.	Payqa ichaqa allintam ruwan.
This is a one-time event.	Kayqa huk kutilla ruwaymi.
I know a lot of people will disagree with me	Yachanim achka runakuna ñuqawan mana acuerdopi kasqankuta
I wasn’t there to help	Manam chaypichu karqani yanapanaypaq
I said firmly	nispaymi sinchita nirqani
But as always, things are never that simple.	Ichaqa sapa kuti hina, manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu imapas.
I still don't believe it	Kunankamapas manam creenichu
I could not have been happier	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu karqa
I can’t do anything about that	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I am very, very happy.	Ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I was rude this morning	Kunan paqarinmi mana allin rimaq karqani
I don’t want to do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu
So yeah, it’s best not to do that.	Chaymi arí, aswan allin kanman chayta mana ruway.
Where are you?.	Maypitaq kachkanki?.
That sounds pretty serious.	Chayqa ancha serio hinam uyarikun.
I didn’t really want to talk to him now	Kunanqa manan anchatachu paywan rimayta munarqani
You’re a great girl.	Hatun sipasmi kanki.
I was not happy about this	Kaymantaqa manam kusisqachu karqani
I heard nothing about it	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas uyarirqanichu
I can’t wait to be gone from here.	Manam suyayta atinichu kaymanta manaña kasqayta.
He was just like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinallam karqa.
So beautiful, so innocent.	Ancha sumaq, ancha mana huchayoq.
At one time I was very good.	Huk tiempopiqa ancha allinmi karqani.
I had no intention of doing that	Chay ruwayqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
But I feel better	Ichaqa aswan allinmi sientekuni
This is probably a good thing.	Kayqa ichapas allin kanman.
They know where you are.	Paykunaqa yachanku maypi kasqaykita.
I mean, this is great for me	Niyta munani, kayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq
But that’s pretty much obvious.	Ichaqa chayqa yaqa sut’inmi.
That would have been too easy.	Chayqa llumpay facilmi kanman karqa.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ichapas huk chikan, ichapas achka.
I didn’t really know how to describe it	Manam allintachu yacharqani imayna willanaypaq
Everything is great.	Tukuy imapas hatunmi.
I think he was surprised	Yuyaykuni admirasqa kashasqanmanta
I wasn’t really surprised	Manam chiqaptachu admirakurqani
Person.	Runa.
He said no, it’s fine.	Payqa manan, allinmi kashan nirqan.
He said that it was not.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
I don’t have a sense of beauty	Manam sumaq kaymanta yuyayniyuqchu kani
I didn’t want to talk to anyone	Manam piwanpas rimayta munarqanichu
I’m tired and hungry too	Ñuqapas sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima kachkani
He knew this was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi kay hamunanta.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
How could it be.	Imaynataq kanman.
It means frequently.	Sapa kuti niyta munan.
He was actually quite nice.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allin sumaq runam karqa.
You want to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munanki.
But it was summer time.	Ichaqa verano tiempon karqan.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Paqarinmi allin punchaw kananmanta yuyani
I think he might do that this time	Yuyaykuni kay kutipi chayta ruwanman
I don’t want to ignore it	Manam munanichu mana uyariyta
She really wanted to share it with him but she was scared.	Payqa anchatan paywan willayta munarqan ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
I know you are new here.	Yachanim kaypi musuq kasqaykita.
Black makes such a statement.	Yana chayna rimayta ruwan.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
I was the best thing in the world	Ñoqaqa kay pachapi aswan allin kaqmi karqani
I don’t know anything about this really.	Manam imatapas kaymanta yachanichu chiqaptaqa.
A really nice guy.	Chiqap sumaq runa.
You know what.	Yachankichu imata.
He didn't know how to deal with this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kayta imayna atipananta.
I wonder what he’ll do about it	Tapukuni imatataq chaymanta ruwanqa nispa
Don’t be like that.	Ama chayna kaychu.
I had no idea what was going on	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu karqani imakuna pasasqanmanta
It happened a lot.	Achkatam pasarqa.
He can still hold on.	Hinallam hapiyta atin.
I am still overwhelmed	Hinallam llumpay llakisqa kachkani
I want him to win that.	Chayta atipananta munani.
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta
This seems pretty bad.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
He said he would do so later.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwasaq nispas nin.
I wonder if I like it	Tapukunitaqmi gustawanchu icha manachu chayta
It was certainly the challenge.	Chiqamanta chay sasachakuy karqa.
Really, I am very sorry	Chiqaptam, anchata llakikuni
He didn’t want to talk to anyone.	Payqa manan piwanpas rimayta munarqanchu.
I was excited about something	Imamantapas kusisqam karqani
I couldn’t sleep	Manam puñuyta atirqanichu
I was supposed to be the one.	Ñuqam chayna kanay karqa.
I have no idea how he feels, or what he feels about.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna sientekusqanmanta, nitaq imamantapas sientekusqanmanta.
He told me he didn’t know.	Mana yachanchu niwarqa.
I think maybe he knew	Yuyaykuni ichapas payqa yacharqa
I just didn’t know how to get out of it.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu chaymanta lluqsiyta.
I could, you know	Ñuqaqa atiyman karqan, yachanki
I’m going to do this again	Kayta yapamanta ruwasaq
I want to say thank you	Gracias niyta munani
I can’t remember it	Manam yuyariyta atinichu
It was the morning.	Paqarinmi karqa.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
That seems to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam.
I didn’t want to be this	Manam kayta munarqanichu
Being a good person doesn’t matter.	Allin runa kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I am fine	Allinmi kachkani
I know this to be true	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani
And that’s fine with that.	Hinaspa chaywanqa allinmi.
This can be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi kanman.
He is very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi.
I had no idea how to do it	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna ruwanaypaq
I didn't know it was coming	Manam yacharqanichu hamunanta, nispa
That worked out pretty well	Chayqa allintam allinta ruwarqa
I really couldn’t tell	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta atirqanichu
I have a strong feeling that something is wrong	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam anchata sientekuni
It seemed great at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
I don't know what his real name is.	Mana yachanichu ima chiqap sutin kasqanmanta.
I was so cold and so scared and so scared	Ancha chiri hinaspa ancha mancharisqa hinaspa ancha mancharisqa karqani
I couldn’t say what happened next	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan niyta atirqanichu
I wanted nothing to do with it	Manam chaywanqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanichu
That’s what I wanted to know	Chaytan yachayta munarqani
Tomorrow I will be worse	Paqarinmi aswan mana allin kasaq
I didn’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
But that is what he wants to be.	Ichaqa chayna kaytam munan.
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu pasarqa.
Then, or afterwards.	Chaymanta, icha chaymanta.
I was very happy to do so.	Ancha kusisqam karqani chayta ruwaspa.
But I don’t understand why	Ichaqa manan entiendenichu imarayku chayta
Things weren’t quite right.	Imapas manam allintachu karqa.
I’ve always been busy, too busy.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ocupasqa karqani, llumpay ocupasqa.
He was never too sure about it.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa llumpayta segurochu karqa.
It must be useful for something.	Imapaqpas allinmi kanan.
But more recent than this.	Ichaqa kaymanta aswan kunan pacha.
I wanted to know everything about him	Paymanta tukuy imata yachayta munarqani
Once you do this, that’s it.	Huk kuti kayta ruwaspaqa, chaymi.
How beautiful it is.	Imayna sumaqmi.
And then this happened	Hinaspa chaymanta kayqa pasarqa
I know exactly who he is	Pi kasqanmanta allinta yachani
Now it's like here.	Kunanqa kaypi hinam kachkan.
More than a few this time.	Aswan iskay kimsa kay kutipi.
I knew you didn't want that either	Yacharqanim qampas chayta mana munasqaykita
I’ve done that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqani.
He wanted something.	Payqa imatapas munarqanmi.
I had to be there.	Chaypim kanay karqa.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Manam yacharqanichu chaywan imata ruwanaypaq
I couldn't figure out why.	Manam imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu.
You don’t know what it’s going to be like.	Manan yachankichu imayna kananta.
He was good, but you were better.	Payqa allinmi karqan, qanmi ichaqa aswan allin karqanki.
I’m good at it.	Allinmi kani chaypi.
Or tell me what works.	Utaq willaway imakuna allin kasqanmanta.
He could barely see her.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana rikuyta atirqanchu.
But I don’t believe that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa creenichu
I used to be too	Ñuqapas haykapipas karqani
It came out looking really good.	Chiqamanta allin qhawarisqa lluqsirqa.
Strong people, really strong people.	Sinchi runakuna, chiqap sinchi runakuna.
But you can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I think that's for sure	Chayqa seguro kasqanmantam piensani
So that was nice.	Chaymi chayqa sumaq karqa.
I haven’t heard anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu
I didn’t want to give up.	Manam saqiyta munarqanichu.
I hope he never comes back	Suyachkani mana haykapipas kutimunanta
I thought it was very good	Ancha allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
He knew he never would.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayta ruwananta.
More next week.	Astawan hamuq semanapi.
I’ve done this before.	Kaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqani.
I knew about it a long time ago	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaymantaqa yacharqani
He’s not worth it.	Payqa manan valenchu.
And then you want more.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa aswan achkata munanki.
I don’t need this	Manan kaytaqa necesitasaqchu
It didn’t go badly.	Manam mana allintachu rirqa.
He is a man of truth.	Payqa chiqap rimaq runam.
Three, two, one.	Kimsa, iskay, huk.
I am a much older person now.	Kunanqa aswan kuraq runam kani.
Tell me they’re here.	Willaway kaypi kasqankuta.
Obviously he knew.	Sut’inmi payqa yacharqan.
I wasn’t the only one.	Manam ñuqallachu karqani.
I knew he did at one time	Yacharqanim huk tiempopi chayta ruwasqanmanta
Somewhere in there.	Maypipas chaypi.
You can’t come here.	Manam kayman hamuyta atiwaqchu.
I'll do everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwasaq.
I couldn’t believe it	Manam creeyta atirqanichu
He was happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa tarikurqa.
I don’t feel comfortable with that.	Manam chaywanqa allintachu sientekuni.
He looked really familiar.	Payqa chiqap riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
But not for very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu.
He told me not to talk.	Paymi niwarqa ama rimanaypaq.
Where is it located?.	Maypitaq kachkan?.
I wasn’t that person.	Ñuqaqa manam chay runachu karqani.
I hear there are too many	Uyarini ancha achka kasqankuta
I tried to block everything	Tukuy imata hark’ayta munarqani
It was very cold.	Sinchi chiri kasqa.
The man is a fool.	Chay runaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I thought about it for a long time	Chaytaqa unayñam piensarqani
I was sure of that	Chaymantaqa segurom karqani
I thought you said you were a good player	Allin pukllaqmi kasqaykita nisqaykita yuyaykurqani
I know what he’s thinking	Yachanim ima yuyaykusqanmanta
It won’t be.	Manan kanqachu.
We’re better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kayku.
He's been through a lot	Payqa achkatam pasarqa
He knew what was going on.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus pasashasqanmanta.
Then he wants to talk to you.	Chaymantam qanwan rimayta munan.
I didn’t know exactly where it was.	Manam maypi kasqanmantaqa allintachu yacharqani.
I can’t say anymore though	Manañam ichaqa niyta atiymanchu
I couldn’t have said it	Manam niyta atiymanchu karqa
And saying thank you.	Hinaspa gracias nispa.
I was tired though	Sayk’usqañan karqani ichaqa
I knew something was very wrong	Yacharqanim imapas ancha mana allin kasqanmanta
I am a lonely person	Ñuqaqa sapallay runam kani
But I can’t seem to do it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwayta atiyman hina.
I know how hard it is	Yachanim chayna sasa kasqanmanta
I couldn’t let him go	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu ripunanpaq
I was happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa karqani.
I mean the first one was good	Niyta munani ñawpaq kaq allinmi karqa
Maybe it doesn’t matter now	Ichapas kunanqa mana imananpaschu
I think tomorrow is another day.	Paqarin huk p'unchaw kananpaqmi yuyaykuni.
And very nice sometimes.	Hinaspa ancha sumaq wakin kuti.
That’s a good, very good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, ancha allinmi.
He would not have been a happy man.	Payqa manan kusisqa runachu kanman karqan.
But something else just happened.	Ichaqa huk imapas chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
But he couldn’t say.	Ichaqa manan niyta atirqanchu.
I did the same thing.	Chaynatam ruwarqani.
It won’t happen unless you act quickly.	Manan chay hinachu kanqa manachus usqhaylla imatapas ruwanki chayqa.
I don't know what happened to him	Paywan ima pasasqanmantaqa manam yachanichu
I really think you should	Chiqaptam piensani chayta ruwanaykipaq
He looked very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
I wouldn’t be able to find it	Manam tariyta atiymanchu karqa
I am trying to do better	Aswan allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani
I didn’t want him to know, not ever	Manam munarqanichu yachananta, manam haykapipas
But nothing much.	Ichaqa manan imapas anchatachu.
So there you go!.	Chaymi chaypi rinki!.
The patient will be arrested.	Unqusqa hap’isqa kanqa.
I didn't expect it to be this fast	Manam suyarqanichu kayna utqaylla kananta
The next thing is.	Qatiqnin kaqmi.
I was very impressed	Anchatam admirakurqani
Never mind, he says.	Ama hayk’aqpas, nispas nin.
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Manañam rimayta munarqanichu
I knew one was coming	Yacharqanim huknin hamunanta
That would be a mistake.	Chayna ruwayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I sure wanted to.	Seguro munarqani.
I don't know why that didn't happen.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna mana pasasqanmantaqa.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
Does it really exist???.	¿Chiqaptachu kan???.
I thought hard about it.	Sinchitan yuyaykurqani.
I cannot comment on this now	Kunanqa manam kaymantaqa rimayta atiymanchu
But that was no longer true.	Ichaqa manañan chayqa cheqaqchu karqan.
Here it is now.	Kaypi kunan kachkan.
I wanted to make sure he was right	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kayta munarqani
I spent some time with him.	Huk tiempon paywan karqani.
All right, yes.	Allinmi, arí.
It looks stupid.	Sonso hinam rikchakun.
I knew he was here	Yacharqanim kaypi kasqanmantaqa
It was an easy thing to do.	Chayqa facil ruwaymi karqa.
But it is a very difficult time.	Ichaqa ancha sasa tiempon.
Please act quickly.	Ama hina kaspa, usqhaylla ruway.
Together and happy.	Kuska hinaspa kusisqa.
I didn't think it was there	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta
I mean, tomorrow morning	Niyta munani, paqarin paqarin
I almost wish it were	Yaqapaschá chayna kananta munani
I suspect it doesn’t matter	Sospechani mana imananpaschu
I knew exactly where it was in advance	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi allinta yacharqani maypi kasqanmanta
I did, and the day seemed fresh.	Chaynatam ruwarqani, chaymi chay punchawqa chayllaraq hina karqa.
I’m actually not a very nice person.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha sumaq runachu kani.
I know what they are	Yachanim ima kasqankuta
I couldn’t stop doing this	Manam kay ruwaytaqa saqiyta atirqanichu
I feel secure about that.	Chaymantaqa segurom tarikuni.
I couldn’t let him be sad anymore	Manañam llakisqa kananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I still wanted to be with him.	Hinallam paywan kayta munarqani.
I’ve wanted it for a long time	Unayñan munarqani
This was not going to be good.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanan karqa.
I don't know why anyone would want this job.	Mana yachanichu imarayku pipas kay llamkayta munanman.
At home, anywhere.	Wasipi, maypipas.
He wasn’t always there.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu karqan.
I often wonder if there is another way	Sapa kutim tapukuni huk ruway kanchu icha manachu chayta
I've never seen him without it	Manam haykapipas mana chaywanqa rikurqanichu
He wanted her, and she had him.	Payqa munarqanmi, chaymi payta hap’irqan.
I just didn’t see what a big deal it was	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta
Maybe one day I'll have to make one	Ichapas huk punchaw hukta ruwanay kanqa
I couldn’t figure that out	Manam chaytaqa yachayta atirqanichu
But now he knew the truth.	Kunanmi ichaqa cheqaq kaqta yacharqan.
I never thought he would do so much	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna llumpayta ruwananta
So far it has been great.	Kunankamaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
What a crazy world.	Ima loco pacha.
That would certainly do that.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
He says he’s not here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan nispas nin.
But there is no time.	Ichaqa manan tiempo kanchu.
I don't know if it really is.	Mana yachanichu sichus chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
I am so glad we did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atinichu.
I didn’t want to either	Ñoqapas manan munarqanichu
I have heard it so many times	Chayna achka kutitam uyarirqani
Every day of the week.	Semanapi sapa punchaw.
I always am, I always am, I always will be	Sapa kutim kani, sapa kutim kani, sapa kutim kasaq
I think he’s tired of knowing too much.	Yuyaykuni llumpayta yachasqanmanta sayk’usqa kasqanmanta.
In fact, I’m not less minded about anything anymore	Chiqaptaqa manañam imamantapas pisi yuyayniyuqchu kani
But I couldn’t wait any longer	Ichaqa manañan suyayta atirqanichu
I was sure there was something there	Seguro karqani chaypi imapas kasqanmanta
He knows now, sort of.	Payqa kunan yachan, huk laya.
Maybe the next one.	Ichapas qatiqnin.
It is very difficult to talk now.	Ancha sasam kunan rimayqa.
That’s not going to happen here.	Chayqa manan kaypichu kanqa.
I didn’t realize you were	Manam repararqanichu chayna kasqaykita
I never really thought about it.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
He was there all day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi chaypi karqa.
I know how to play this well	Kayta pukllayta allinta yachani
And that’s the big problem.	Hinaspa chaymi hatun sasachakuy.
I want to do it again	Hukmanta ruwayta munani
Then the big deal.	Chaymanta hatun ruway.
Like a good young man.	Allin wayna hina.
It wasn’t immediate, but we had to do something.	Manam chayllachu karqa, ichaqa imatapas ruwanayku karqa.
I don’t see him	Manam paytaqa rikunichu
I can’t handle those things.	Manam chaykunataqa atiymanchu.
That was the moment.	Chayqa karqan chay rato.
Yes, you did it.	Arí, qanmi ruwarqanki.
He could not do or understand anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu nitaq entiendeyta atirqanchu.
I couldn’t stand it	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu
It’s the next day.	Paqarin punchawmi.
And things went wrong.	Hinaspa imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I know exactly who you are	Allintam yachani pi kasqaykita
I seriously had no idea where mine was	Serio mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani maypi ñuqapa kaqta
The rich man.	Qhapaq runa.
I really didn’t know why	Chiqaptaqa manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa
He knew it was devastating.	Payqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi yacharqan.
I thought about it but I meant it	Chayta yuyaykurqani ichaqa niyta munarqani
So week.	Chaymi semana.
First, there was the new building.	Ñawpaqtaqa, chay musuq wasi ruwaymi karqa.
I really didn’t do well	Chiqamanta mana allintachu ruwarqani
Here’s to me.	Kaypi ñuqawan.
But he could have done so.	Ichaqa chaynatam atinman karqa.
There is nothing about it.	Manam imapas chaymantaqa kanchu.
We are not like you.	Manam qam hinachu kayku.
All the same, he knew it was there.	Tukuy chayna, chaypi kasqanmanta yacharqa.
I didn’t really want to talk to him now.	Kunanqa manan anchatachu paywan rimayta munarqani.
I can't bear to quit again	Manam aguantayta atinichu hukmanta saqiyta
The really bad thing.	Chiqap mana allin kaq.
I need that right now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi necesitasaq.
I haven’t done that in a long time	Unayñan mana chayta ruwarqanichu
He is now the man.	Payqa kunanmi chay runa.
I didn’t want to leave it in the car	Manam carropi saqiyta munarqanichu
I didn’t think it was really for me	Manam piensarqanichu chiqaptapuni ñuqapaq hina kananpaq
I wanted to find something new	Musuq kaqta tariyta munarqani
I wonder what he’s thinking	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta
Everything was like that.	Tukuy imapas chayna kasqa.
This is the kind of thing.	Kay hina kaqmi.
I never see him again	Manañam haykapipas paytaqa rikunichu
Everything is fine with that.	Chaywanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
A real person would never do that	Cheqaq runaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu
I won't be able to do that from here	Chaytaqa manam kaymantaqa ruwayta atisaqchu
Eventually I got better at it.	Qhepamanmi chaypi aswan allinta ruwarqani.
This is a very strange thing.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi.
They really do matter.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin importante kanku.
What do you want to do about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwayta munanki?.
I want to do all the nonsense	Tukuy mana yuyayniyuq kaqta ruwayta munani
The first is about security.	Ñawpaq kaqmi seguro kaymanta.
That sure as sure was a novelty.	Chayqa seguro hina seguro karqan huk mosoq kaq.
I wouldn't be here today	Manam kunan punchawchu kaypi kayman
They love to play.	Paykunaqa anchatam pukllayta munanku.
He certainly knew that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yacharqan.
Which would be great.	Imataq ancha allin kanman.
But he didn’t know exactly.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yacharqan.
I don’t understand anything	Manam imatapas entiendenichu
I was so happy, I really wanted it	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani, anchatam munarqani
I never knew there were so many.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqanmanta.
You’re not sure.	Manam segurochu kanki.
I hope it was for you	Suyachkani qampaq kasqanmanta
He knew what he meant, but he didn't say it.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima niy munasqanmanta, ichaqa manan nirqanchu.
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I never said it right	Manam haykapipas allintachu nirqani
Every day was a great day.	Sapa punchawmi hatun punchaw karqa.
I was very stupid.	Ancha sonso karqani.
Three weeks ago.	Kimsa semana ñawpaqta.
It does a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwan.
They want him to succeed.	Paykunaqa munanku allinta ruwananta.
I didn’t do that either.	Ñuqapas manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He couldn't bear to be there anymore.	Manaña aguantayta atirqachu chaypi kayta.
He needs to do better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwanan.
In fact, they were there.	Chiqaptaqa chaypim karqaku.
I can’t imagine it	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
But I can do this	Ichaqa kaytam ruwayman
They know two things.	Paykunaqa iskay imatam yachanku.
First of all.	Ñawpaqtaqa.
I can't get away with it now	Kunanqa manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu
I just learned his name	Chayllaraqmi sutinta yacharqani
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.	Sichus llumpay allin uyarikun chayqa, yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
And that’s crazy.	Hinaspa chayqa loco.
I thought it was pretty cool.	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I hear them now.	Chaykunataqa kunanmi uyarini.
It can do a lot but nothing really good.	Achkatam ruwayta atin ichaqa manam imapas chiqap allinchu.
I wanted to do one for a while.	Hukta ruwayta munarqani huk rato.
And now this has to happen.	Hinaspa kunanqa kaymi kanan.
Know that it will happen.	Yachay chayta pasananta.
I didn’t have to act like I was disappointed	Manam hukmanyasqa hinachu ruwanay karqa
But where people are.	Ichaqa maypichus runakuna kashanku.
It’s not hard to get hold of things.	Manam sasachu imakunatapas hapiyta atin.
The result will soon be here.	Chay ruwasqanqa pisi tiempollamantan kaypi kanqa.
I hope to see you again soon	Suyachkani chaylla hukmanta rikuyta
This is what you want.	Kaytam munanki.
I was sick and tired of it	Chaywanmi unqusqa sayk’usqa karqani
Even if he doesn’t have to.	Manaña ruwanan kaptinpas.
It’s the best so far.	Kunankamaqa aswan allinmi.
You didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqankichu.
But not everything is that simple.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas chhayna facilchu.
I'm very caught up	Anchatam hapini
I never thought it would be like this	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayna kananta
But I knew it was	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta
I am very proud of that.	Chaymantam anchata orgulloso kani.
I am happy to be alone sometimes	Kusisqam kachkani wakin kuti sapallay kasqaymanta
He sounds like a kid.	Payqa huk wawa hinam uyarikun.
He did three things.	Kimsa ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
After that, nothing.	Chay qhepamanmi mana imapas.
Better than nothing.	Aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
You don’t want to know about it.	Chaymantaqa manam yachayta munankichu.
I wish I had left earlier but I didn’t	Munaymanmi karqan ñawpaqta ripuyta ichaqa manan
Even so, unhappiness is not the best option here.	Chayna kaptinpas, mana kusisqa kayqa manam kaypiqa aswan allinchu.
I hope this year is the last time	Suyachkani kay wata qhipa kuti kananpaq
I know it's ugly, though	Yachanim millay kasqanmanta, ichaqa
This was supposed to be him.	Kayqa paymi kanan karqa.
And then, yes.	Hinaspa chaymanta, arí.
I can’t see him now.	Manam kunanqa paytaqa rikuyta atinichu.
Twice in two weeks.	Iskay semanapi iskay kutita.
I know how to find him.	Payta imayna tariyta yachani.
I don't understand why I would do that	Manam entiendenichu imarayku chayta ruwanaypaqqa
I knew that very well	Chaytaqa allintam yacharqani
I’m not that kind of person.	Manam chayna runachu kani.
I know what that is like	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta
I need to do better	Aswan allinta ruwanay tiyan
I mean, they were good, everything	Niyta munani, paykunaqa allin karqanku, tukuy ima
If done right, it can be very rewarding.	Allinta ruwaspaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Everything remained the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.
I knew that meant they were here	Yacharqanim chaywanqa kaypi kasqankuta niyta munasqanmanta
I hope he doesn’t come back	Suyachkani mana kutimunanta
But this is very difficult.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha sasam.
He can't think.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinchu.
I think it worked out well	Allintam lluqsirqa nispam piensani
He’s very much his own man.	Payqa ancha kikin runan.
He was a human being. 	Payqa runam karqa. 
This is the last step.	Kayqa qhipa kaq ruwaymi.
To say what he meant	Ima nisqanta rimananpaq
There are people like that out there.	Chay hina runakunaqa kanmi hawapi.
I think you have a good idea	Allin yuyayniyuq kasqaykita yuyani
I kept thinking about the problem	Hinallam chay sasachakuypi piensarqani
I couldn’t answer	Manam kutichiyta atirqanichu
There is a good chance it will fail.	Allin chansa kanmi mana allinta ruwananpaq.
I really thought you were mad at me	Cheqaqtapunin yuyaykurqani ñoqawan phiñasqa kasqaykita
After all, it had happened once before.	Tukuy imamanta, huk kutilla ñawpaqtaqa chayna karqa.
However, there is more.	Ichaqa, aswanpas kanmi.
He and she and him.	Paywan paywan.
But this is.	Ichaqa kay.
It wasn’t really for me.	Manam chiqaptachu ñuqapaq karqa.
I didn’t know you were married, again	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqaykita, yapamanta
I couldn’t understand it	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu
I suspect that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam sospechani
But I have to do something first	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi imatapas ruwanay kachkan
I didn't think it was about him	Manam paymanta kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
That was not an easy task	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan
I know that he will	Yachanim chayna ruwananta
You know that person is a bad person.	Yachankim chay runa mana allin runa kasqanmanta.
He looked very nervous.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
You go do what you do best.	Allin ruwasqaykita ruwanaykipaq rinki.
I knew you could do it wrong	Yacharqanim mana allinta ruwayta atisqaykita
I just couldn’t let it happen	Chaylla pasananta mana saqiyta atirqanichu
I’m the only one.	Ñuqallam kachkani.
I was the next person	Qatiqnin runam karqani
But I couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu.
I didn’t want to do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu
It’s harder this time	Aswan sasa kay kutipi
It was a difficult time.	Chayqa sasa tiempon karqan.
It didn’t make it real.	Manam chiqap kananpaqchu ruwarqa.
This went rather well.	Kayqa aswan allintam pasarqa.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa.
He was certainly right.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allinta rimarqan.
I thought it was true.	Ñuqaqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He knew it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi.
But I want it right.	Ichaqa allintam munani.
But I need more time	Ichaqa aswan tiempotan necesitasaq
I almost didn’t want to leave	Yaqa manañam ripuyta munarqanichu
That was part of that.	Chayqa chaymanta hukninmi karqa.
I don’t know why he told you that.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayta nisurqanki.
There's probably a good chance it will.	Yaqapaschá allin chansa kanman chayna kananpaq.
Everyone was very tired.	Lliwmi llumpayta sayk’usqa karqaku.
Not trying to make music or doing anything.	Mana takiyta ruwayta munaspaqa nitaq imatapas ruwayta munaspaqa.
I haven’t seen it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
I think that would be interesting	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman nispam piensani
It will be easy now.	Kunanqa facilmi kanqa.
I was actually happy	Chiqaptaqa kusisqam tarikurqani
He came before anything else.	Payqa imamantapas ñawpaqtaraqmi hamurqa.
I do things right	Imatapas allintam ruwani
Please let me know what you think.	Ama hina kaspa willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Kaypiqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
But maybe the truth was he was worth it.	Ichaqa ichapas cheqaq kaq karqan payqa allinpaq qhawarisqa.
I had to do what I had to do	Imachus ruwanay kaqta ruwanay karqa
I know what you are not	Yachanim ima mana kasqaykita
It’s not the worst.	Aswan mana allinchu.
So we did that for about a year.	Chaymi chayta ruwarqayku yaqa huk wata.
I can’t do anything either	Ñoqapas manan ima ruwaytapas atinichu
But he refused to do so	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu
The second step is important.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
That seems sad.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
Time to be gone.	Tiempo manaña kananpaq.
But it’s not really working.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu llank’ashan.
I won’t do that to him	Chaytaqa manam paytaqa ruwasaqchu
I didn’t mean anything by it.	Manam chaywanqa imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
That you’re not good enough for him now.	Kunan paypaq mana allinchu kasqaykita.
There is a bad thing.	Mana allinqa kanmi.
I had no idea you were here	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kaypi kasqaykita
I can probably be happy about this	Yaqapaschá kaymanta kusisqa kayta atiyman
I don’t want to talk about it yet.	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa rimayta munanichu.
I didn’t want to hear those things	Chaykunataqa manam uyariyta munarqanichu
I just knew it felt great	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani ancha allin sientekusqanmanta
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Manam pitapas nitaq imatapas rikurqanichu
I wonder if he was ever here	Tapukuni sichus hayk'aqllapas kaypi karqanchu
He was immediately terrified.	Chaylla mancharisqa.
I wanted him all along	Tukuy tiempon paytaqa munarqani
He couldn't believe it.	Payqa manam creeyta atirqachu.
So he couldn’t win.	Chayraykum mana atipayta atirqachu.
I wasn’t in a position to talk to him	Manam paywan rimanaypaq hinachu karqani
I couldn’t do anything about it, really	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu, chiqaptaqa
Unfortunately for me.	Llakikuypaqmi ñuqapaq.
I can't remember why, but there we are.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu imarayku, ichaqa chaypim kachkaniku.
I want to have a word or two with you	Munani huk iskay simita qanwan rimayta
That won’t always be the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu kanqa.
I knew exactly what was coming	Allintam yacharqani imakuna hamunanta
Yes, it was cold.	Arí, chiri karqa.
I have no idea how he did it	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna ruwasqanmanta
If he’s not too tired.	Mana ancha sayk’usqa kaptinqa.
But someone did it.	Ichaqa pipas chaytan ruwarqan.
I like it quite a bit	Allintam gustan
I couldn’t stop walking.	Manam puriyta saqiyta atirqanichu.
I was a little nervous, that’s all	Huk chikan mancharisqa karqani, chaylla
I knew he was worried	Yacharqanim llakisqa kasqanmanta
I didn’t expect an answer.	Manam suyarqanichu kutichiyta.
This is not going to work.	Kayqa manan allintachu ruwanqa.
I really didn’t realize that at the time	Chiqaptaqa manam chaynataqa chay tiempopiqa repararqanichu
That wasn’t a human being.	Chayqa manam runachu karqa.
He knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana facilchu kananta.
He was a teacher.	Yachachiqmi karqa.
He couldn’t talk about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas rimayta atirqanchu.
And that you are.	Hinaspa chayna kasqaykita.
I didn’t know what it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I couldn’t say no at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan mana niyta atirqanichu
Nothing new about it.	Manam imapas musuq chaymantaqa.
I wasn’t too surprised	Manam anchatachu admirakurqani
A little harder than that.	Chaymanta huk chikan aswan sasa.
I have been married for three years.	Kimsa watañam casarasqa kachkani.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.	Imayna kaptinpas kunanqa manam imananpaschu.
I know there could be something better than this	Yachanim kaymanta aswan allin imapas kanman
They are not happy.	Paykunaqa manan kusisqachu kashanku.
I didn’t mean those things	Manam chaykunataqa niyta munarqanichu
I couldn't believe it was him	Manam creeyta atirqanichu pay kasqanmanta
I knew what was coming next.	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna hamunanta.
I am a man of the world	Kay pacha runam kani
I never know what he's going to do	Manam haykapipas yachanichu ima ruwananta
I think at the end of the day we did very well.	Yuyaykuni p’unchaw tukukuypi ancha allinta ruwasqaykumanta.
Do this first.	Ñawpaqtaqa kayta ruway.
And he’s great.	Hinaspa payqa hatunmi.
I know where you live	Yachanim maypi yachasqaykita
I never really thought about it either	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu
I was very curious	Anchatam yachayta munarqani
Some good, some not so good.	Wakin allin, wakin mana chayna allin.
I have a great idea now	Kunanqa hatun yuyayniyuqmi kani
He was so amazing.	Payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He knew what was going on.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I’m not sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
He did it right.	Allintam ruwarqa.
I know you want that	Yachanim chayta munasqaykita
I want it so much	Anchatam munani
I always fail.	Sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwani.
He refused to go with her.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan riyta.
I didn’t want him at all	Manam paytaqa ni imapipas munarqanichu
He was alone, as ever.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa, ñawpaq hina.
I hope so, I hope so	Chayta suyachkani, chayta suyachkani
You were a bigger person than me.	Qamqa ñuqamanta aswan hatun runam karqanki.
You know what, no.	Yachanki imata, mana.
This seems absurd.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam.
I didn’t hear or see anyone	Manam pitapas uyarirqanichu nitaq rikurqanichu
I don't see how that can be here.	Manam rikunichu imaynatam chay kaypi kanman.
I think it is wrong.	Mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t tell you how bad this feels	Manan niyta atiymanchu kay imayna mana allin sientekusqanmanta
I wasn’t really surprised by it	Manam chaywanqa anchatachu admirakurqani
I couldn’t really say	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atirqanichu
That sounds much better.	Chayqa aswan allinta uyarikun.
I didn’t see this coming	Manam rikurqanichu kay hamunanta
I am doing well now.	Kunanqa allintam ruwachkani.
I'll be there tomorrow.	Paqarin punchawmi kasaq.
I thought he would do that	Chayta ruwananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I can’t sleep, you know.	Manam puñuyta atisaqchu, yachanki.
I want to go there too	Ñuqapas chayman riyta munani
I just barely saw him at all	Chayllaraqmi yaqa mana rikurqanichu ni imapipas
I know you know how that feels	Yachanim chay imayna sientekusqanmanta yachasqaykita
Obviously I was fired	Sut’inmi qarqosqa karqani
I can't speak for very long. 	Manam ancha unayta rimayta atinichu. 
I just knew there was something here	Chaylla yacharqanim kaypi imapas kasqanmanta
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi karqa.
I couldn’t say why, really.	Manam niyta atirqanichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
Maybe he was crazy.	Ichapas payqa loco karqa.
He looks familiar.	Payqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakun.
I didn’t want to talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu
Both were well there.	Iskayninkum allinta chaypi karqaku.
I was never good at this	Manam haykapipas kaypiqa allinchu karqani
I want to be more famous.	Ñuqaqa aswan riqsisqa kaytam munani.
But you never know for sure.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yachanki.
I knew why he did it	Yacharqanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta
That day is still one.	Chay punchawqa hinallam kachkan huknin.
I was really crazy.	Cheqaqtapunin loco karqani.
I couldn’t let that happen	Manam chayna kananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I didn't do it today	Manam kunan punchawchu ruwarqani
I still can’t sleep anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manaraqmi puñuyta atinichu
You may never know	Ichapas mana haykapipas yachankichu
I didn’t want to see it that way.	Manam chaynata qawayta munarqanichu.
I was a man and something else	Runa karqani huk imapas
He can’t answer.	Payqa manan kutichiyta atinchu.
Every morning they .	Sapa paqarinmi paykunaqa .
Herein lies the problem.	Kaypim sasachakuy kachkan.
But, it’s not just that.	Ichaqa, manan chayllachu.
I just wasn’t there	Ñuqaqa mana chayllachu karqani
Not proud of it.	Mana chaymanta orgulloso.
He says he’s busy.	Payqa nin ocupasqa kashasqanmanta.
He didn’t want this.	Payqa manan kayta munarqanchu.
I can never be like you	Manam haykapipas qam hina kayta atiymanchu
He wants to be something.	Payqa imapas kaytam munan.
I’m not that person	Manam chay runachu kani
She didn’t say yes but she didn’t say no.	Payqa manan arí nirqanchu ichaqa manan mana nirqanchu.
I saw half of them.	Chaykunataqa kuskan rikurqani.
Yes, there it was again.	Arí, chaypi yapamanta karqa.
I didn’t know how to stop him from leaving	Manam yacharqanichu imaynata harkayta ripunanpaq
I still can't figure it out	Kunankamapas manam yuyaymanayta atinichu
He couldn’t be himself.	Payqa manan pay kikin kayta atirqanchu.
That will be important later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi importante kanqa.
I wasn’t ready an hour ago	Huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi mana listochu karqani
No one else can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
He knew exactly what he wanted	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima munasqanmanta
It’s going to be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanqa.
I know no one knows about this	Yachanim kaymanta mana pipas yachasqanmanta
He came to the scene.	Payqa chayman hamurqa.
I couldn't do that to him.	Chaytaqa manam paytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
I’m sorry it had to be done.	Llakikuni chayta ruwana kasqanmanta.
I know you are scared.	Yachanim mancharisqa kasqaykita.
I didn’t see that coming.	Manam chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
It’s very easy after that.	Chay qhepamanmi ancha facil.
I hope you are well.	Suyachkani allin kasqaykita.
It still sounds good	Kunankamapas allinmi uyarikun
This is absurd.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I really didn’t know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yacharqanichu.
That’s what I had to do	Chaynatam ruwanay karqa
I know it will be the only thing	Yachanim chaylla kananta
Without housing there is no future.	Mana wasi kaptinqa manam hamuq pacha kanchu.
I didn’t see him in action	Manam paytaqa ruwaypi rikurqanichu
If you’re okay with that, this is all.	Sichus chaywan allin kashanki chayqa, kaymi llapan.
It should be just that.	Chayllaraqmi kanan.
But at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopi.
I want to believe him	Payta creeyta munani
I haven't thought about it in a long time.	Unayñam chaypiqa mana piensanichu.
He said this every year.	Chaynatam sapa wata nirqa.
I didn’t know how to cope	Manam yacharqanichu imayna aguantayta
I never thought anything about it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas yuyaykurqanichu.
I’m really sorry about that	Chiqamanta llakikuni chaymanta
I hope he wins.	Suyachkani atipananta.
I know you know that	Yachanim chayta yachasqaykita
I had to be that thing	Chay imapas kanay karqa
I didn’t really know that at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaytaqa allintachu yacharqani
However, he refused.	Ichaqa, manan munarqanchu.
And now he’s gone.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña kanchu.
I was tired last night but very happy	Qayna tutan sayk’usqa karqani ichaqa ancha kusisqa
Unfortunately, it's not good.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam allinchu.
It happened over and over again.	Sapa kutim pasarqa.
I want to answer.	Kutichiyta munani.
A week ago, he didn’t know where he was	Huk semana ñawpaqtaqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta
He was a good man, and he was in trouble.	Payqa allin runam karqa, chaymi sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Therefore, it is not human.	Chayraykum mana runa hinachu.
I didn’t think of those things	Manam chaykunataqa yuyaykurqanichu
I wish you were here with me	Munaymanmi kaypi ñoqawan kasqaykita
I really didn't expect that	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa suyarqanichu
But it may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
Nervous.	Mancharisqa.
I just did it a week ago	Chayraqmi huk semana ñawpaqta ruwarqani
He was much faster.	Payqa aswan utqayllam karqa.
I’ve never seen it before	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu
I wanted to say that for some reason	Imaraykupas chayta niyta munarqani
I can’t see anyone	Manam pitapas qawayta atiymanchu
I didn’t notice him.	Manam paytaqa repararqanichu.
I am the secret you want	Munasqayki pakasqa kaqmi kani
Most people are good.	Yaqa llapan runakunam allin kanku.
I know this is not easy for you	Yachanim kayqa mana facilchu qampaq kasqanmanta
I had no idea there was so much going on	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna achka ruway kasqanmanta
I could do this all day with you	Kaytaqa tukuy punchawmi qanwan kuska ruwayman
I just can’t figure out how to do it.	Manapaschá imayna ruwanaypaqqa yuyaymanayta atinichu.
He didn’t want to stop her, it’s no use.	Payqa manan hark’ayta munarqanchu, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
That was not a good thing.	Chay nisqanqa manan allinchu karqan.
All over again.	Tukuy imamanta yapamanta.
That doesn’t sound like him.	Chayqa manan pay hinachu uyarikun.
No one would want that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa munanmanchu.
He has to do everything himself.	Tukuy imata pay kikin ruwanan tiyan.
I knew that wouldn't happen	Yacharqanim chayna mana pasananta
This was the best part.	Kaymi aswan allin kaq karqa.
He didn’t seem worried at all.	Payqa manan imapipas llakisqa hinachu karqan.
That was insane.	Chayqa loco kaymi karqa.
I was actually kind of good at it	Chiqaptaqa chaypiqa huk laya allinmi karqani
He had said something before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi imatapas nisqa.
He wanted to be the best.	Payqa munarqanmi aswan allin kayta.
I didn't know there were so many	Manam yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqanmanta
Maybe tomorrow this house will be mine.	Ichapas paqarin kay wasi ñuqapa kanqa.
I have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanay tiyan.
He’s very much like you in this way.	Payqa anchatan qan hina kay hinata.
It was truly unique.	Cheqaqtapunin mana imapas hinachu karqan.
I can do this job	Kay llamkayta ruwayta atiyman
Not always, but sometimes.	Mana sapa kutichu, aswanpas wakin kuti.
I didn’t think they were that serious	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna serio kasqankuta
I am not doing well at all.	Manam allintachu ruwachkani ni imapipas.
Maybe it was a chance.	Ichapas huk chansa karqa.
I knew better, though	Aswan allintam ichaqa yacharqani
I just found out that it was	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani chayna kasqanmanta
I am happy to have him here	Kusisqam kachkani kaypi paywan kasqaymanta
I’ve never really done it before	Manam chiqaptaqa haykapipas ruwarqanichu ñawpaqtaqa
And this seems right.	Hinaspa kayqa allinmi rikchakun.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananpaq.
I was there once too	Ñuqapas huk kutim chaypi karqani
I knew the truth.	Yacharqanim chiqap kaqta.
I know tomorrow morning	Paqarin paqarinmi yachani
Something like that, yeah.	Imapas chayna, arí.
He acts like a baseball player	Payqa béisbol pukllaq hinam ruwan
I didn’t expect an answer	Manam kutichiyta suyarqanichu
You know very well how important it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
That’s all there is to it.	Chayllam kachkan.
I think he was right	Payqa allintan rimarqan, nispan yuyaykuni
They want to be better.	Paykunaqa aswan allin kaytam munanku.
I never knew this was the case	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kayna kasqanmantaqa
She knew he wanted more from her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta astawan munasqanmanta.
I think this is true	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani
I was angry about it too	Ñoqapas chaymanta phiñasqa karqani
I wanted this to be addressed as soon as possible	Kayta usqhaylla qhawarisqa kananta munarqani
I know you have a secret.	Yachanim pakasqa kasqaykita.
I feel very comfortable	Ancha allinmi tarikuni
I did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqani.
I couldn’t give up	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu
Just outside the box.	Chaylla hawapi.
This is a great day.	Kayqa hatun punchawmi.
I didn't notice him until now	Kunankamaqa manam paytaqa repararqanichu
I would never do anything	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwaymanchu
He can’t, he can’t, he can’t.	Payqa manan atinchu, manan atinchu, manan atinchu.
I want to come with you	Qanwan kuska hamuyta munani
I thought that was you	Chayqa qanmi kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
It doesn’t make any sense to anyone.	Manam pimanpas imapaqpas valenchu.
I couldn't see anything else	Manam hukta qawayta atirqanichu
I want to say something	Imatapas niyta munani
I didn’t want to be yours	Manam qampaq kayta munarqanichu
I really couldn't tell you why	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I can’t tell you what it is	Manam willayta atinichu ima kasqanmanta
I was the real thing	Ñuqaqa chiqap kaqmi karqani
I think he should learn more about it first	Yuyaykuni ñawpaqta chaymanta astawan yachananpaq
It’s good, though.	Allinmi ichaqa.
The second time around.	Iskay kaq kutipi.
I know what’s coming	Yachanim ima hamunanta
They are scared and worried.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima kachkanku.
I was tired of it	Chaywanmi sayk’usqa karqani
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa mana allinchu rikchakun.
I almost certainly did	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani
I feel safe and secure	Allintam hinaspa segurom tarikuni
I wanted to help him	Payta yanapayta munarqani
I knew what he was going to do	Yacharqanim ima ruwananta
There they were, here we are.	Chaypim karqaku, kaypim kachkaniku.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Probably, it’s you.	Yaqapaschá, qanmi kanki.
I didn’t want to believe it	Manam creeyta munarqanichu
I have an interesting idea	Ñuqaqa huk sumaq yuyayniyuqmi kani
More than a problem.	Sasachakuymanta aswan.
I really like him as a person	Anchatan gustan huk runa hina
I really wanted that	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa munarqani
How things are going.	Imaynataq imapas kachkan.
I knew this was not going to be easy	Yacharqanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta
Or anyone, really.	Utaq pitapas, chiqaptapuni.
I need sleep, that’s all	Puñuyta necesitasaq, chaylla
There were no people.	Manam runakunaqa karqachu.
I was a very angry teenager too	Ñuqapas ancha phiñasqa wayna sipasmi karqani
I don’t know what it’s like yet	Manaraqmi yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa
However, the process would not last long.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa unaytachu kanman.
He couldn’t stand it.	Mana aguantayta atirqachu.
I wanted to know everything and everything that was going on here.	Kaypi tukuy ima kaqta, tukuy ima kaqta yachayta munarqani.
I don't know how long you'll be here.	Manam yachanichu hayka tiempo kaypi kanaykita.
Say it again.	Hukmanta niy.
If only he were with me now.	Sichus kunan ñoqawan kanman karqan chayqa.
I didn’t see it there either	Ñuqapas manam chaypiqa rikurqanichu
Several times this evening, in fact.	Achka kutita kay chisi, chiqaptaqa.
Do it if you really want to.	Chiqaptapuni munaspaqa ruway.
But then, he was an important man.	Ichaqa chaymanta, payqa importante runan karqan.
But this is the new reality.	Ichaqa kaymi mosoq cheqaq kaq.
The reason doesn’t matter.	Imarayku chayta ruwasqanqa manan imananpaschu.
The people were not happy.	Runakunaqa manam kusisqachu karqaku.
But he didn’t think about it.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
You can't tell how many there are.	Manam hayka kasqanmantaqa yachayta atiwaqchu.
I know you are mine	Yachanim ñuqapa kasqaykita
I am very sorry now	Kunanqa anchatam llakikuni
I wanted to get out of here.	Kaymanta lluqsiyta munarqani.
I really want to be here.	Anchatan munani kaypi kayta.
I don’t think that would be right.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
I knew why, too much had happened	Yacharqanim imarayku, llumpay pasasqanmanta
I didn’t know what was going on	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
Very clever indeed.	Ancha yachaysapa chiqap.
Yeah, now and then that’s it.	Arí, kunan chaymanta chaylla.
Yeah, something like that.	Arí, imapas chayna kaq.
This means you can do other things with it.	Kayqa niyta munan huk ruwaykunata chaywan ruwayta atisqaykita.
I didn’t want anyone to know what was going on here	Manam munarqanichu kaypi imakuna kasqanmanta pipas yachananta
It was wonderful to be with him again.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa hukmanta paywan kayqa.
I was better off that way	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi karqani
It’s obviously wrong.	Sut’inmi pantasqa kasqanmanta.
Now, however, it is now.	Kunanmi ichaqa kunan.
Maybe he doesn’t know what it’s like.	Ichapas mana yachanchu imayna kasqanmanta.
I never remember being arrested	Manam haykapipas yuyarinichu hapisqa kasqayta
I can’t think about it	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu chaypiqa
And never like this.	Hinaspa mana hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa.
I was immediately overwhelmed	Chayllam llumpayta admirakurqani
It was the best time of the summer.	Chayqa chiri tiempopi aswan allin tiempon karqan.
I really can’t wait for that!	¡Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta suyayta atiymanchu!
I can be there.	Chaypi kayta atiyman.
And that’s the biggest thing.	Hinaspa chaymi aswan hatun kaq.
But that was nice.	Ichaqa chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
I was there for three years	Chaypin kinsa wata karqani
They didn’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu karqanku.
This should continue.	Kayqa hinallam kanan.
I have to do it, you know	Ñuqaqa ruwanay tiyan, chayta yachanki
In fact, that was not true.	Aswanpas chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
I knew what he wanted.	Yacharqanim ima munasqanmanta.
But no, nothing.	Ichaqa manan, manan imapas.
It’s not always the best way to do it though.	Manan sapa kutichu aswan allin ruway ichaqa.
I had to do a few	Iskay kimsa ruwanay karqa
I didn’t know they were there	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqankuta
I think it makes for a richer story	Yuyaykuni aswan qhapaq willakuyta ruwan
I want to know who they are.	Pikuna kasqankuta yachayta munani.
No one wants to talk.	Manam pipas rimayta munanchu.
I can't really be with him and do a lot of things	Manam chiqaptachu paywan kayta hinaspa achka ruwaykunata ruwayta atiyman
Here’s one that doesn’t.	Kaypi huk mana chayta ruwaq.
Something is seriously wrong.	Imapas sinchi mana allinmi kachkan.
He wanted her to be disappointed.	Payqa munarqanmi hukmanyasqa kananta.
I don’t want to be any different	Manam huk hina kaytaqa munanichu
But it is a bad thing to do well in the first place.	Ichaqa mana allin ruwaymi puntata allinta ruwananchikpaq.
Many times before.	Achka kuti ñawpaqta.
It was all so absurd.	Tukuy imapas ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I didn’t really know what he wanted	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima munasqanmanta
I just wasn’t happy.	Chayllam mana kusisqachu karqani.
But it wasn’t bad.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu karqan.
I couldn’t sit there, with it, any longer	Manaña chaypi tiyayta atirqanichu, chaywan, astawan
I know what happened	Yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
I wanted to do more	Aswan ruwayta munarqani
I didn't know what it was at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
That’s the biggest thing.	Chayqa aswan hatun ruwaymi.
I can't help this anymore	Manañam kayta yanapayta atiymanchu
Then another person.	Chaymanta huk runa.
I couldn’t believe it was real	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqap kasqanmanta
I didn’t always look like this	Manam sapa kutichu kayna rikchayniyuq karqani
That was a wonderful thing to say.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan chay nisqanqa.
I hope to see him tomorrow	Paqarin payta rikuyta suyachkani
I couldn’t understand what had happened or why.	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu ima pasasqanmanta nitaq imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
You’ve done really well out there.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwarqanki chay hawapi.
I didn't realize how late it was	Manam repararqanichu hayka tarde kasqanmantaqa
You do this twice.	Chaytaqa iskay kutitam ruwanki.

This is not an easy task.	Kayqa manan facil ruwaychu.
If if if .	Sichus sichus.
He quit an hour ago.	Huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi saqirqa.
It was here, and he knew it.	Kaypim karqa, chaytam payqa yacharqa.
You know, he said.	Yachankim nirqa.
She wanted to wait for him to come back.	Payqa kutimunanta suyayta munarqa.
I wanted to be a teacher	Yachachiq kaytam munarqani
It would be better to do so now.	Aswan allinmi kanman kunan chayta ruwayqa.
I just don’t know what you’re saying you know.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imatachus yachanki nisqaykita.
I’m afraid not for very long at all	Manchakuni mana ancha unaytachu ni imapipas
I know how hard it must be for you	Yachanim imayna sasa qampaq kananta
I want to do this today	Kunan punchawmi kayta ruwanayta munani
I wonder a lot about it.	Achkatam chaymanta tapukuni.
This is crazy.	Kayqa loco.
I think that would be amazing	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman, nispan yuyaykuni
He couldn't be here.	Payqa manam kaypi kayta atirqachu.
I want to know what he’s doing out there	Chay hawapi ima ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani
A few weeks later, he said he had been arrested.	Iskay kinsa semana qhepamanmi nirqan hap’isqa kasqanmanta.
I think he was married to her	Yuyaykuni paywan casarasqa kasqanmanta
No you can’t.	Manan manan atiwaqchu.
I know this for a fact	Kaytaqa allintam yachani
But I don’t believe it.	Ichaqa manan creenichu.
I want it to be all me	Tukuy ñuqa kananta munani
He was really into it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayman haykurqan.
But he has no choice here.	Ichaqa manan kaypiqa ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
I don't know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He could never have done that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
If it’s black.	Yana chayqa.
I didn’t realize this would happen, but it’s fine	Manam repararqanichu kay pasananta, ichaqa allinmi
It can do it here though.	Kaypi ruwayta atin ichaqa.
I knew that at least.	Chaytaqa yacharqanim aswanpas.
How did he do it.	Imaynatataq ruwarqa.
Maybe they weren’t ready for me	Ichapas mana listochu karqaku ñuqapaq
I want to know the back story	Qhipa willakuyta yachayta munani
I can walk right away	Chaylla puriyta atiyman
I wanted to be sure	Seguro kaytam munarqani
I know as well as anyone.	Pipas hinam allinta yachani.
I'll be a good person	Allin runam kasaq
I am not a bad person.	Manam millay runachu kani.
I knew something like this would happen	Yacharqanim kayna imapas pasananta
He said he was very busy.	Payqa nirqam ancha ocupasqa kasqanmanta.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan karqa.
Do this regularly.	Kayta sapa kuti ruway.
I wasn’t sure if he did or not	Manam segurochu karqani chayta ruwasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta
And last night it did.	Hinaspa qayna tuta chayta ruwarqa.
I know you're not there.	Yachanim mana chaypi kasqaykita.
You just have to do it.	Chayllaraqmi ruwanayki.
About anything, he says.	Imamantapas, nispas nin.
I want to tell you.	Willayta munani.
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I want nothing to do with it	Chaywanqa manam ima ruwaytapas munanichu
I was happy that everything was fine	Kusisqam karqani tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta
But it was hard not to.	Ichaqa sasam karqa mana ruwayqa.
I repeat the action.	Ruwayta yapamanta ruwani.
I didn’t expect it to be true	Manam suyarqanichu chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I will be here for ten days or more	Kaypiqa chunka punchaw utaq aswan punchawmi kasaq
But you can’t do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I really want to win.	Anchatan munani atipayta.
I don't understand how to fix it.	Manam entiendenichu imayna allichayta.
I have a different opinion	Huk yuyayniyuqmi kani
Very, very bad.	Ancha, ancha mana allin.
It’s not difficult at all.	Manam sasachu ni imapipas.
I think this is the case	Kayna kasqanmantam piensani
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ichapas mana kanchu.
But I'm pretty sure it doesn't.	Ichaqa ancha segurom kachkani mana kasqanmanta.
But I do do that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa ruwani.
He is doing what he has to do.	Payqa imatachus ruwana kasqanta ruwachkan.
He could never get over it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta atipayta atirqanchu.
But no one can do anything about it	Ichaqa manan pipas chaypiqa imatapas ruwanmanchu
I know something went wrong that time	Yachanim chay kutipi imapas mana allin pasasqanmanta
I know what kind of person you are	Yachanim imayna runa kasqaykita
I knew exactly what he was doing	Allintam yacharqani ima ruwasqanmanta
She wants to be him.	Payqa paymi kayta munan.
I heard it three times	Kimsa kutitam uyarirqani
I hope you are not	Suyachkani mana chayna kasqaykita
I said that it was.	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqani.
I have seen this too many times before	Ñawpaqtaqa llumpay kutitam kayta rikurqani
I want to do this job.	Kay llamkayta ruwayta munani.
I saw him twice, a few weeks ago	Iskay kutitam rikurqani, iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqta
That is still not easy.	Chayqa kunankamapas manam facilchu.
I wonder what you are doing now	Tapukunitaqmi kunan imatataq ruwachkanki
This is unfortunate for me.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi ñuqapaq.
I could never really figure it out	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
He was something of a fool.	Payqa imapas mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I haven’t seen him in a long time	Unayñan mana paytaqa rikunichu
I wanted to know where he was	Maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
I'm good.	Allinmi kani.
I know what happens out there	Yachanim chay hawapi imakuna pasananta

I think it might be harder in the future	Yuyaykuni hamuq tiempopi aswan sasa kanman
I know who they are.	Yachanim pikuna kasqankuta.
I do a pretty good job.	Allin allintam ruwani.
He didn’t have to do that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan ruwanan karqanchu.
I know enough to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani
I didn’t know what that was all about	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa
Maybe it wasn’t meant to be	Ichapas mana chayna kananpaqchu karqa
I don’t remember anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yuyarinichu
I felt tired again.	Hukmanta sayk’usqa hina tarikurqani.
I know I knew what it was	Yachanim yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
I’ve done this too	Ñoqapas kaytan ruwarqani
I knew the consequences	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna kananta
I want to be married	Casarasqa kaytam munani
I couldn't resist them	Chaykunataqa manam harkayta atirqanichu
The future, the past.	Hamuq pacha, ñawpaq.
I’m almost an adult	Yaqa kuraq runam kani
I have no idea where it is	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi kasqanmanta
The doer of the	Chay ruwaq.
Perhaps, so but there is no way about this.	Ichapas, chayna ichaqa manam kanchu imayna kaymantaqa.
I just tried my best.	Chayllaraqmi kallpanchakurqani.
All over the place.	Tukuy chaypi.
I thought this was the hardest part	Kayqa aswan sasa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
More about being proud of me.	Astawan ñuqamanta orgulloso kaymanta.
I didn’t see it coming	Manam hamunanta rikurqanichu
But I do know that	Ichaqa chaytaqa yachanin
This will make the build process worse.	Kayqa ruway ñanta aswan mana allinta ruwanqa.
I can’t understand either	Ñuqapas manam entiendeyta atinichu
There really is no other word.	Chiqaptaqa manam huk rimayqa kanchu.
He's right.'	Payqa allintam rimachkan'.
I couldn’t look at him.	Manam paytaqa qawayta atirqanichu.
If it does, that’s great.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa, chayqa ancha allinmi.
I have no idea what that was about	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa
He couldn't see her anymore.	Manañam qawayta atirqachu.
I couldn’t even do that	Manam chayta ruwaytapas atirqanichu
He doesn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanchu.
At least this was a good thing.	Aswanpas kayqa allinmi karqan.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
And please don’t.	Hinaspa ama hina kaspa.
Not a difficult thing to do but he had to do it.	Mana sasa ruwaychu aswanpas ruwanan karqan.
Go somewhere but here.	Maymanpas riy mana kaypichu.
But tell me more about that.	Ichaqa chaymanta astawan willaway.
You don’t know.	Manam yachankichu.
I still can’t do it.	Kunankamapas manam atinichu.
The guy was a guy.	Chay runaqa kasqa.
I want to do this like him	Pay hinam kayta ruwayta munani
We did it, again and again.	Chayta ruwarqayku, yapamanta yapamanta.
I’m sure you never want to hear it again.	Seguro kani manaña hayk’aqpas uyariyta munankichu.
They want him to know that.	Chayta yachananta munanku.
He can’t make money.	Payqa manan qolqeta tariyta atinmanchu.
But they weren’t ready there yet.	Ichaqa chaypiqa manaraqmi listochu karqanku.
I need money today.	Kunan punchawmi qullqita necesitasaq.
I couldn't believe it	Chaykunataqa manam creeyta atirqanichu
If there is one.	Huknin kaptinqa.
But that’s what you have to do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanayki.
He knows this.	Payqa kaytam yachan.
Man, if you want to listen	Runa, uyariyta munanki chayqa
I think that's probably so bad	Chayqa ichapas chayna mana allin kasqanmanta piensani
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.
I just didn’t want to be alone all the time	Chaylla mana tukuy tiempo sapallay kayta munarqanichu
I have been here many times	Achka kutitam kaypi karqani
Thank you, she said.	Gracias, nispas nin.
I couldn’t see him.	Manam paytaqa rikuyta atirqanichu.

I mean, we’re good together	Niyta munani, kuska allin kanchik
I’ve been there for a long time now	Kunanqa unayñan chaypi kashani
I want to believe him though	Payta ichaqa creeyta munani
Very nice thing.	Ancha sumaq kaq.
It can’t be true.	Mana chiqap kayta atinchu.
I didn’t even know anything about him	Manam imatapas paymanta nitaq yacharqanichu
And someone does it.	Hinaspa pipas ruwan.
I knew something was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas pasananta
I don’t care either	Ñoqapas manan imananpaschu
Very important day.	Ancha importante punchaw.
That there is nothing else.	Mana imapas huk kasqanmanta.
I had no idea what was going on	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani imakuna pasasqanmanta
I heard it there.	Chaypim uyarirqani.
So please do tell me.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa ruway willaway.
I want it to be really quick	Munani chiqap utqaylla kananta
Maybe there are more arrests tonight	Ichapas kunan tuta aswan achka hapisqa kachkanku
I actually agree with him on that	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam paywan acuerdopi kani
I want to talk about it	Chaymanta rimayta munani
This means something.	Kayqa imapas niyta munan.
I don’t want to say his name.	Sutinta mana niyta munanichu.
Instead, a person .	Aswanpas huk runaqa .
It’s easier that way.	Aswan facilmi chayna.
I was the only adult	Ñuqallam kuraq runa karqani
Thankfully, they are very good at it.	Gracias, paykunaqa ancha allinmi chaypi.
I just wasn’t sure why.	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imarayku.
Maybe it’s better to just say it.	Ichapas allin kanman chaylla niyta.
I was really good at it	Chiqaptam chaypiqa allin karqani
I don’t understand why he did that.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I want to do something	Imatapas ruwayta munani
I feel tired and exhausted	Sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa ima sientekuni
I didn’t know anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
He was here today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi kaypi karqa.
I can't tell anyone about this	Kaymantaqa manam pimanpas willayta atiymanchu
I want to know more about him	Paymanta astawan yachayta munani
I do like a challenge	Ñuqaqa huk sasachakuy hinam ruwani
I said it wouldn’t happen.	Manam kanqachu nispaymi nirqani.
I want you to do two things	Iskay ruwaykunata ruwanaykita munani
I still do this today.	Kunankamapas kaytam ruwani.
I have anyway that	Ñuqaqa imayna kaptinpas chay
I could have done this sooner	Kaytaqa aswan utqayllam ruwayman karqa
I know where this is going	Yachanim mayman kayqa risqanmanta
There is a truth.	Cheqaq kaqmi kan.
It’s really really really hard.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta chiqamanta sinchi.
So this was it.	Chaymi kayqa karqa.
We did a lot of that.	Chaytaqa anchatam ruwarqayku.
I didn’t mean to say.	Ama niyta munarqanichu.
He shouldn’t be doing that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwananchu.
I am very sorry about this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.
I was the best at it	Ñuqam chaypiqa aswan allinqa karqani
I couldn’t remember how to say it	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imayna rimayta
I do everything for myself.	Tukuy imatam ñuqapaq ruwani.
They weren’t ready.	Paykunaqa manan listochu karqanku.
I think he was wrong	Payqa pantasqa kasqanmantam piensani
It may not mean what it says in the past.	Manapaschá ñawpaqpi nisqanman hinachu niyta munan.
I couldn’t talk to him anymore	Manañam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
I had to be the best	Aswan allin kaqmi kanay karqa
I never heard it was wrong before	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu ñawpaqtaqa pantasqa kasqanmanta
I've never heard anything like it	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa uyarirqanichu
But he wanted to.	Payqa ichaqa munarqanmi.
I think he was really sick	Chiqap unqusqa kasqanmantam piensani
I have no idea when he'll be back	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani haykapi kutimunanta
I couldn’t hear anyone	Manam pitapas uyariyta atirqanichu
He’ll be there.	Payqa chaypi kanqa.
I do it all the time, you know	Sapa kutim ruwani, yachanki
I didn’t want to tell you, but there it is.	Manam willayta munarqanichu, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
That makes me feel good.	Chayqa allintam sientekuni.
Two weeks, at most three.	Iskay semana, aswan achka kimsa.
I don't really know why.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
A few years older than me	Ñoqamanta iskay kinsa wata kuraq
That he would do it.	Chayta ruwananta.
I hope all is well	Tukuy imapas allin kananpaqmi suyachkani
The very last one.	Chay ancha qhipa kaq.
It’s not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkan.
I hope to find something special	Suyachkani imapas ancha sumaq kaqta tariyta
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan kayqa.
But I can’t remember now	Ichaqa manan kunanqa yuyariyta atinichu
If you were like some of that.	Sichus wakin chaymanta chay hina karqanki.
I didn’t want to go anywhere	Manam maymanpas riyta munarqanichu
I'm sure he thinks so.	Seguro kani chayna piensasqanmanta.
Here it wasn’t.	Kaypiqa manam karqachu.
They are both adults.	Iskayninkum kuraq runakuna kanku.
I thought he was stupid anyway	Imayna kaptinpas sonso kananpaqmi piensarqani
All right, we’re all right.	Allinmi, allinmi kayku.
I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
I would never have done that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa
I said goodnight.	Allin tuta nispaymi nirqani.
He thought that was the best thing to do.	Payqa chaylla aswan allin kasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
Please tell me what you want me to do.	Ama hina kaspa willaway ima ruwanayta munasqaykita.
I knew you would be here	Yacharqanim kaypi kanaykita
There was a good crowd.	Allin achka runakunam karqa.
But he can't get out anymore.	Ichaqa manañam lluqsiyta atinchu manañam.
I wanted to take a different route	Huk ñanta puriyta munarqani
But I’m never like that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kani
If you agree, great.	Sichus acuerdopi kanki chayqa, ancha allinmi.
I wasn’t happy anymore	Manañam kusisqachu karqani
I thought it was pretty funny	Allin asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani
I'm all over there I've ever been	Ñuqaqa tukuy chaypi kani haykapipas karqani
I could never figure out why	Manam haykapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to tell you	Manam willayta munarqanichu
I should have done that a long time ago	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwanay karqan
I don't understand what went wrong	Manam entiendenichu ima mana allin pasasqanmantaqa
This was the best thing that ever happened to him.	Kaymi aswan allinqa karqa paywan pasasqanmantaqa.
Everything makes sense now	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allin yuyayniyuqmi
No, they weren’t.	Manan, manan chay hinachu karqanku.
One of them came out.	Hukninmi lluqsirqa.
I didn’t know what it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
It had to be there.	Chaypin kanan karqan.
Maybe it never is.	Ichapas mana haykapipas kanchu.
Something was wrong, he knew.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa, chaytam yacharqa.
I had to be like him	Pay hinam kanay karqa
He can do difficult things.	Payqa sasa ruwaykunata ruwanman.
She couldn't believe how good it felt.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu imayna allin sientekusqanmanta.
I just thought he was in the city	Chayllaraqmi piensarqani chay llaqtapi kasqanmanta
I’m hoping for the best	Suyachkani allin kaqta
He had to do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayta ruwanan karqan.
But there is that.	Ichaqa kanmi chay.
I want to ask you why this is good	Tapuyta munani imaraykutaq kay allin kasqanmanta
I tried not to do that	Chayta mana ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
I do, sometimes.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, wakin kuti.
I wasn’t always like this	Manam sapa kutichu kayna karqani
I don’t want to sit here.	Manam kaypi tiyayta munanichu.
The reason for this is simple.	Imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa facilmi.
I couldn’t be happier	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atirqanichu
That was supposed to be his real name.	Chayqa chiqap sutinmi kanan karqa.
He could walk there.	Chaypim puriyta atinman karqa.
Maybe it’s up to me	Ichapas ñuqamanta kanqa
I think he’s on to something.	Yuyaykuni imapipas kashasqanmanta.
He came here to be real.	Payqa kayman hamurqa chiqap kananpaq.
I've never done that before	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
But he doesn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwanchu.
It was a really tough time	Chiqamanta sinchi pacha karqa
Then you’ll know.	Chaymantam yachanki.
Please tell me more about that.	Ama hina kaspa chaymanta astawan willaway.
What really happened.	Imakuna chiqap pasasqanmanta.
I know you're out there	Yachanim hawapi kasqaykita
You never knew when it was coming.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu haykapi hamunanta.
I was too foolish	Llumpay mana yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I am a happier person	Aswan kusisqa runam kani
I didn’t want to do it.	Manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
I can’t say the word.	Manam chay simitaqa niyta atiymanchu.
All well and good.	Tukuy allin hinaspa allin.
That’s what I want to do	Chaynatam ruwayta munani
I can’t tell you what’s going to happen	Manam willayta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta
You don’t quite know what to say.	Mana allintachu yachanki ima niyta.
I used to live here.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim tiyaq kani.
It's never anyone else.	Manam haykapipas huk runachu.
Tonight, it doesn't matter.	Kunan tutaqa, manam imananpaschu.
But I’m lucky	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kani
I really didn’t know what that meant	Chiqamanta mana yacharqanichu chay ima niyta munasqanmanta
I need more time.	Aswan tiempotan necesitasaq.
He does what he says he will do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwan.
I was so proud of myself.	Anchatam orgulloso karqani.
I think it is everything	Ñuqaqa tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensani
I felt familiar and strange	Riqsisqa hinaspa mana riqsisqa hinam tarikurqani
We can’t go out there.	Manam chaymanqa lluqsiyta atichwanchu.
I still can't believe he did it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu chay ruwasqanqa
No one is ever right or wrong.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
He knew that it was important.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruway ancha importante kasqanta.
I wanted him not to do that	Ñuqa, mana chayta ruwananta munarqani
But no, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
I don’t want to be about that	Manam chaymantaqa munanichu
They want to know more.	Paykunaqa astawan yachayta munanku.
I can’t stop him now.	Manam kunanqa harkayta atiymanchu.
The practice continues today.	Kunankamapas chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
That’s the ultimate truth.	Chayqa qhepa kaq cheqaq kaqmi.
I'm sure yours isn't.	Seguro kani qampaq kaq mana kasqanmanta.
I was there last night.	Qayna tutam chaypi karqani.
I'm doing a good job.	Allintam ruwachkani.
He was no fool, she knew.	Payqa manan sonso runachu karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
I was very surprised that he seemed to be alone	Anchatam admirakurqani sapallan hina kasqanmanta
I disagree with that	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopichu kani
Or something else.	Utaq imapas.
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwananta
I want to know everything about him	Paymanta tukuy imata yachayta munani
I really mean it this time	Chiqamanta kay kutipi chayta niyta munani
I like it a lot	Anchatam gustan
Better than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan allinqa.
I tried for two years	Iskay watañam kallpanchakurqani
That wouldn’t be true	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman
I really didn’t want to know	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta munarqanichu
I heard it all	Tukuy chayta uyarirqani
It's like learning to swim.	Chayqa nadayta yachay hinam.
I'm really sorry about that, you know	Chiqaptam chaymantaqa anchata llakikuni, yachanki
I know what he means	Yachanim ima niyta munasqanmanta
I can't think of it that way	Chaynataqa manam yuyaymanayta atinichu
I know what’s coming.	Yachanim ima hamunanta.
I was worried a	Ñuqaqa llakisqa karqani huk
I really want this	Kaytaqa anchatam munani
I don’t know what happened.	Manam yachanichu ima pasasqanmanta.
That one person had to be me.	Chay huk runam ñuqa kanan karqa.
Instead, he’s arrested.	Aswanpas hap’isqa.
That seemed a little sad.	Chayqa huk chikan llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
I can't believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atinichu
I couldn't help it either	Ñuqapas manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
It’s not right for you.	Manam qampaq hinachu.
I didn’t expect this	Manam kaytaqa suyarqanichu
It just doesn’t.	Chaylla mana.
I couldn't remember ever being happier	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu haykapipas aswan kusisqa kasqayta
And he wanted to come, she said.	Hinaspa hamuyta munarqa, nispas nin.
Still, he was happy.	Chayna kaptinpas payqa kusisqam tarikurqa.
He stayed there for a while.	Chaypin huk rato qhepakurqan.
I heard all about it	Tukuy chaymanta uyarirqani
I didn’t want to leave a message	Manam huk willakuyta saqiyta munarqanichu
Now I know everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachani.
I feel so much better.	Ancha allinmi sientekuni.
Isn’t that something? 	¿Manachu chayqa imapas?
I want to hear everything	Tukuy imata uyariyta munani
I never heard of him	Manam haykapipas paymanta uyarirqanichu
I hope he comes back soon	Suyachkani chaylla kutimunanta
It was really too much of a good thing.	Chiqamanta llumpay allin kaq karqa.
I have no idea what happened.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima pasasqanmantaqa.
I have to do the right thing, you know	Allin kaqta ruwanay tiyan, yachanki
If it is lower, do nothing.	Aswan pisi kaptinqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
I don’t know how to fix it yet.	Manaraqmi chayta allichayta yachanichu.
I feel like a real person now.	Kunanqa chiqap runa hinam tarikuni.
He’s very, very mean.	Pay ancha, ancha millay.
But I learned a lot	Ichaqa achkatam yacharqani
I thought maybe it would all work out	Yuyarqanim ichapas tukuy imapas allin kanman nispa
I didn’t want to hear this	Manam kayta uyariyta munarqanichu
But, that doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan imananpaschu.
A lot went wrong.	Achkatam mana allintachu rirqa.
I can’t deal with that now	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa atipayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t bear to hear more from him	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu paymanta astawan uyariyta
He couldn't stand it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa aguantayta atirqanchu.
He's sort of right.	Payqa huk laya allintam rimachkan.
I couldn’t leave it at that	Manam chaynataqa saqiyta atirqanichu
is available in the	nisqa tarikun.
I didn't really think it could be you	Manam chiqaptachu piensarqani qam kayta atisqaykita
Before, I did nothing to help him	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imatapas ruwarqanichu payta yanapanaypaq
I have the impression that it is really bad	Chiqap mana allin kasqanmantam yuyayniyuq kani
They are in town now.	Kunanqa llaqtapi kachkanku.
I can’t let that happen	Manam saqiyta atiymanchu chayna kananta
I had no idea you could sing like that	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani chayna takiyta atisqaykita
Eventually there would be time for him.	Qhepamanmi paypaq tiempo kanman karqan.
I really didn't want that to happen	Chiqaptaqa manam munarqanichu chayna imapas pasananta
I was hurt and angry	K’irisqa, phiñasqa ima karqani
So I think it’s better now	Chaymi kunanqa aswan allinqa, nispan yuyaykuni
I can't believe he's here	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqanmanta
I thought you might want to come too	Yuyarqanim qampas hamuyta munanki nispa
One of the biggest, in fact.	Huknin hatun, chiqaptaqa.
I had no intention of doing that	Manam chayta ruwanaypaqqa yuyaykurqanichu
And what’s more, worse, it got him.	Hinaspa imataq aswan, aswan mana allinqa, payta hap’irqan.
I thought nothing of it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
I wasn't ready for that	Chaypaqqa manam listochu karqani
But this would be too soon.	Ichaqa kayqa llumpay utqayllam kanman.
But then again.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta.
I didn't think it was serious	Manam piensarqanichu serio kananpaq
And then something very new happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta imapas ancha musuq pasarqa.
I didn’t realize how hard it was	Manam repararqanichu imayna sasa kasqanmanta
And there's one almost every day.	Hinaspa yaqa sapa punchaw huknin kan.
I couldn’t see the future	Manam hamuq tiempota qawayta atirqanichu
He did very well here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
I feel bad about this.	Kaymantaqa mana allintam sientekuni.
I couldn’t understand what was going on	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu ima pasasqanmanta
I think you’re fine.	Allinmi kanki nispan yuyaykuni.
I don’t want to know if it’s better for me.	Manam yachayta munanichu ñuqapaq aswan allin kasqanmantaqa.
I mean I really liked it.	Niyta munani chiqaptapuni gustasqanmanta.
But I didn’t realize how much	Ichaqa manan repararqanichu hayk’a kasqanmanta
You know very well it’s not.	Allinta allinta yachanki manan chay hinachu.
I have to be like everyone else	Ñoqapas llapa runakuna hinan kanay
So tired of it all.	Chaymi sayk’usqa tukuy chaymanta.
I really think he is	Chiqaptam piensani payqa chayna kasqanmanta
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
I want to do the right thing here	Kaypi allin kaqta ruwayta munani
Do it regularly.	Sapa kuti ruway.
Yes, he is.	Arí, payqa.
I knew there was a problem there, again	Yacharqanim chaypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta, yapamanta
But neither was I	Ichaqa manan ñoqapas karqanchu
I really don’t believe he will	Chiqamanta mana creenichu chayta ruwananta
I'm better at it.	Aswan allintam chaypiqa kachkani.
More about me here.	Astawan ñuqamanta kaypi.
I just never gave it much thought before that time	Chayllaraqmi mana haykapipas chaypiqa anchatachu piensarqani chay tiempo ñawpaqtaqa
That was meant to be.	Chayqa chayna kananpaqmi karqa.
I didn’t want this to happen	Manam munarqanichu kay pasananta
I couldn't tell how many there were.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I want to go to town with you today	Kunan punchawmi qanwan kuska llaqtaman riyta munani
I want to be with you	Ñoqaqa munani qanwan kuska kayta
He was a famous man.	Payqa riqsisqa runam karqa.
Better to go without it.	Aswan allinmi mana chaywan riy.
I am sure now.	Kunanqa segurom kachkani.
But I can’t resist helping	Ichaqa manan hark’ayta atiymanchu yanapayta
The value of the	Chayna kaptinqa .
I knew this wasn't going anywhere well	Yacharqanim kayqa mana maymanpas allintachu risqanmanta
I would much rather not.	Ñuqaqa anchatam aswan allinta mana.
I don't think he is though.	Manam payqa chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu ichaqa.
I have no idea how to go about this.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kaymanta rinaypaq.
What happened to that?.	¿Imataq chaywan pasarqa?.
I thought we did really well.	Yuyarqanim chiqaptapuni allinta ruwasqaykumanta.
I’m really terribly tired	Chiqamanta manchay sayk’usqa kachkani
But I can't find a good way to do this.	Ichaqa manan allin ñanta tarinichu kayta ruwanaypaq.
He knows the right answer.	Payqa yachanmi allin kutichiyta.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Like, crazy good.	Imayna, loco allin.
I know you are very busy.	Yachanim ancha ocupasqa kasqaykita.
I’m just myself.	Ñuqaqa ñuqallam kani.
You know there’s nothing.	Yachanki mana imapas kasqanmanta.
I think it's a good thing.	Allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I know you know this	Yachanim kayta yachasqaykita
He’s been waiting a long time.	Payqa unayñan suyashan.
I’ve just been so tired and overwhelmed	Chayraqmi ancha sayk’usqa, sinchita llakisqa ima kashani
This looked really interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
And for the better.	Hinaspa allinpaq.
He really wants to talk to you.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin qanwan rimayta munan.
I can leave a message	Huk willakuyta saqiyta atiyman
I want to talk to you longer	Aswan unayta qanwan rimayta munani
He refused to believe it.	Payqa manan chayta creeyta munarqanchu.
I told him exactly what he wanted to hear	Uyariyta munasqanmanta allintam nirqani
It really depends on how I am on a daily basis.	Chiqamanta sapa p’unchaw imayna kasqaymanta kanqa.
He couldn't believe there were so many.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu chhayna askha kasqankuta.
I know you would anyway	Yachanim imayna kaptinpas chayta ruwawaq
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I want to be my own person	Kikin runa kaytam munani
Tell me quickly.	Utqaylla willaway.
Everyone is great.	Tukuy runa hatunmi.
I would love to know what’s going on here	Anchatan munani kaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta
Maybe there’s a chance.	Ichapas kanman huk chansa.
Three, actually.	Kimsa, chiqaptaqa.
He was really angry.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t want this to be about me	Manam munarqanichu kay ñuqamanta kananta
Sounds like a great world.	Hatun pacha hinam uyarikun.
I never really know when that thing is coming	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachanichu haykapi chay imapas hamunanta
He knew that very well.	Payqa allintan chaytaqa yacharqan.
This whole thing is pretty amazing.	Kay tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi.
This would be surprising.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman.
I was happy at the time	Chay tiempopiqa kusisqam tarikurqani
Most people are bad people.	Yaqa llapan runakunam millay runakuna kanku.
There I thought, okay	Chaypin yuyaykurqani, allinmi
I wasn’t that person	Ñuqaqa manam chay runachu karqani
If only it were that simple.	Sichus chay hina facil kanman chayqa.
I have no idea what to do about it	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq
All of these things are available.	Tukuy kaykunaqa kanmi.
In the best possible way	Aswan allin ruwaypi
I take it you're foolish, too	Ñuqaqa qampas mana yuyayniyuq kasqaykita hapini, chaymantaqa
I wish I didn’t.	Munaymanmi mana chayta.
He doesn’t know the language.	Payqa manam chay simitaqa yachanchu.
He certainly did, he said.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan, nispa.
He wasn’t sure himself.	Payqa manan pay kikin segurochu kasqa.
An hour passed, then another.	Huk hora pasarqa, chaymanta huk hora.
Such greatness has always existed.	Chayna hatun kayqa sapa kutim karqa.
I want to get there as soon as possible	Chaymanqa usqhaylla chayayta munani
Yes, it was a great experience.	Arí, ancha allinmi karqa.
He will do well with her.	Payqa allintam ruwanqa paywan.
I didn’t want to hear it	Manam uyariyta munarqanichu
I’ll be better too	Ñoqapas aswan allinmi kasaq
I haven’t been like that in a long time	Unayñan mana chay hinachu kani
I intend to say that	Chayta niyta yuyaykuni
It’s a big difference.	Hatun chikan kaymi.
I wouldn't be here without him	Mana pay kaptinqa manam kaypichu kayman
No one here has any idea.	Kaypiqa manam pipas ima yuyayniyuqchu.
Please, please, please.	Ama hina kaspa, nispa.
I'm not sure that's a bad thing	Manam segurochu kani chay mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I want to be with him	Paywan kuska kaytam munani
This was going to be a late baby.	Kayqa huk tarde wawa kanan karqa.
The truth is that no one can be sure yet.	Cheqaq kaqmi manaraq pipas seguro kayta atinmanchu.
I don’t think so anymore.	Manañam chaynataqa piensanichu.
I didn’t mean that at all	Manam chaynataqa niyta munarqanichu ni imapipas
I did like him, a lot	Pay hinam ruwarqani, achkata
But the speech was good.	Ichaqa chay rimayqa allinmi karqan.
I mean, a chance with you	Niyta munani, huk chansa qanwan
He drove to his new home for the first time.	Payqa ñawpaq kutitam carropi rirqa musuq wasinman.
I've been waiting all day	Tukuy punchawmi suyachkani
I couldn't say how long it took	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka tiempo pasasqanmantaqa

You are doing that tonight.	Chaytaqa kunan tutam ruwachkanki.
Please let me know what is going on.	Ama hina kaspa willaway imachus pasashasqanmanta.
You can't stop it.	Manan hark'ayta atiwaqchu.
I would be.	Ñuqa kayman.
He wants to.	Payqa munanmi.
So yeah, this does exist.	Chaymi arí, kayqa kanmi.
I want to be here too	Ñuqapas kaypi kaytam munani
I can't you would do that, though	Manam atiymanchu chayta ruwawaq, ichaqa
Something very important.	Imapas ancha importante kaq.
But I did it right	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwarqani
I'm sure there will be something like that	Seguro kani chayna imapas kananmanta
I am doing so much	Ancha achkatam ruwachkani
I’m afraid of everything.	Tukuy imatam manchakuni.
No, no, there is something.	Manan, manan, imapas kanmi.
I know he's crazy about you	Yachanim qammanta loco kasqanmanta
I knew this was hard for him	Yacharqanim kayqa paypaq sasa kasqanmanta
I knew he knew the whole truth	Yacharqanim tukuy chiqap kaqta yachasqanmanta
I can't find it anywhere	Manam maypipas tarinichu
Known to be true.	Chiqap kasqanmanta riqsisqa.
I couldn’t really say.	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atirqanichu.
That’s how I do it.	Chaynatam ruwani.
He couldn't do this anymore.	Manañam kayta ruwayta atirqachu.
I couldn’t bear to live here	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu kaypi tiyayta
He left half an hour early.	Payqa kuskan hora ñawpaqtaraqmi ripurqan.
But no one could be sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas seguro kayta atirqanchu.
That doesn’t mean anything though.	Chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu ichaqa.
I’ve seen him twice before.	Ñawpaqtaqa iskay kutitan payta rikurqani.
But, he did it anyway.	Ichaqa, imayna kaptinpas chaytam ruwarqa.
Or a week.	Utaq semana.
I couldn’t believe it, a man like me	Manam creeyta atirqanichu, ñuqa hina runa
I want the timing to be good	Munani chay tiempo allin kananta
I am so sorry for what happened	Anchatan llakikuni imachus pasasqanmanta
So it’s very strong.	Chaymi ancha sinchi.
This is especially true in the summer.	Chayqa aswan allinmi chiri tiempopi.
It didn’t go very well.	Manam ancha allintachu rirqa.
He wants to do it.	Ruwayta munan.
But he could not see it.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa rikuyta atirqanchu.
He wants to go.	Payqa riyta munan.
It just came out last year.	Chayraqmi qayna wata lluqsirqa.
I found out about an hour ago	Yaqa huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi chayta yacharqani
It would have been a mistake.	Pantasqa kanman karqan.
I actually really like it	Chiqaptaqa anchatam gustan
So he does it.	Chaymi ruwan.
Yes, it’s a sure thing.	Arí, seguro kaqmi.
I didn’t know he was home	Manam yacharqanichu wasinpi kasqanmanta
I should be there tomorrow	Paqarin punchawmi chaypi kanay
I went for a good walk today.	Kunan punchawmi allinta puriq rirqani.
I would never do that	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwaymanchu
Then another one.	Chaymanta huknin.
I didn’t know that before, but it was good	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanichu, ichaqa allinmi karqan
I want you to be mine	Munani ñuqapa kanaykita
I'm not sure which one it is.	Manam segurochu kani mayqin kasqanmanta.
It made her nervous.	Chayqa mancharisqa kananpaqmi ruwarqa.
This sounds a little strange, I must say.	Kayqa huk chikan admirakuypaqmi uyarikun, niyta munani.
Rather more humanely.	Aswanpas aswan runa hina.
I couldn’t talk about it to anyone.	Manam pimanpas chaymantaqa rimayta atirqanichu.
Everything about him.	Tukuy ima paymanta.
I did that very often	Chaytaqa ancha sapa kutim ruwarqani
But this is the third time.	Ichaqa kaymi kinsa kutipi.
Whatever you have to do, do it.	Ima ruwanayki kaptinpas, ruway.
That’s all it really does.	Chaylla chiqaptapuni ruwan.
I couldn’t understand it at first.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan entiendeyta atirqanichu.
It’s okay with that.	Allinmi chaywan.
I know it makes him feel good	Yachanim chaywan allinta sientekusqanmanta
Where is it located.	Maypitaq kachkan.
He wasn't sure he could do that.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I knew it was wrong to talk to him	Yacharqanim paywan rimayqa mana allin kasqanmanta
And sick of being really sick without it.	Hinaspa unqusqa chiqap unqusqa kay mana chaywan.
In fact, this is an easy task.	Aswanpas kayqa facil ruwaymi.
I want it to be there	Chaypi kananta munani
I couldn’t see it	Manam qawayta atirqanichu
I didn't know that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantaqa manam yacharqanichu
Or is it, is it?.	Icha, ¿kanchu?.
I want you to look beautiful	Munani sumaq rikchayniyuq kanaykita
I do a few things.	Iskay kimsa ruwaykunata ruwani.
Make it important.	Importante kananpaq ruway.
I will do that more often	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kutim ruwasaq
I know it's wrong.	Yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
It means something together.	Kuska imatapas niyta munan.
I don’t like that at all.	Chayqa manan ni imapipas gustawanchu.
Someone else has to do the other job	Huk runam huknin llamkayta ruwanan
We are better than this	Kaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanchik
Something could be wrong	Imapas mana allinchu kanman
In a household.	Huk wasipi.
I want to be human again	Hukmanta runa kaytam munani
So you never know how it happens.	Chaymi mana haykapipas yachankichu imayna pasasqanmanta.
I feel better now	Kunanqa allintam sientekuni
He refused to say anything	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu
But of course everyone knows that.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa llapa runa yachanku.
It’s much easier.	Aswan facilmi.
I didn’t really know what he was going to do	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima ruwananmanta
I haven't had that in so long	Chayna unayñam mana chaytaqa tarinichu
I hope you do that	Suyachkani chayta ruwanaykipaq
However, he did.	Ichaqa, chaynatam ruwarqa.
I knew it would happen, someday	Yacharqanim chayna kananta, huk punchaw
Do you really want that?.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayta munanki?.
I’m not going to do this with anyone	Manam piwanpas kaytaqa ruwasaqchu
It sounds stupid, though.	Sonso hinam uyarikun, ichaqa.
He opened the door again.	Yapamanta punkuta kicharirqa.
The people are very nice.	Runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
I did, really.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, chiqaptapuni.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
Maybe he’s tired	Ichapas sayk’usqa kashan
I never want to do anything else	Manam haykapipas huk ruwaytaqa munanichu
Really, really, sad.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, llakisqa.
He is doing something right.	Payqa allintam imatapas ruwachkan.
I've never done anything like that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwarqanichu.
He couldn't sleep that night.	Chay tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqachu.
Good night moon.	Allin tuta killa.
But he can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chhayna ruwaytaqa atinmanchu.
Maybe he didn’t do it right away.	Ichapas mana chayllachu ruwarqa.
I have to disagree here	Kaypiqa manam acuerdopichu kanay
I wonder if they’re both okay	Tapukuni iskayninku allinchu kasqankuta
I mean yes, but that’s not all	Arí niyta munani, ichaqa manan chayllachu
I have never felt so out of place	Manam haykapipas chayna mana hinachu tarikurqani
I feel like he would be proud	Orgulloso kanman hinam tarikuni
I am still happy today	Kunankamapas kusisqam kachkani
You can’t ask anyone.	Manam pitapas tapuyta atiwaqchu.
It is safe there.	Chaypiqa segurom kachkan.
I know he is the most beautiful child in the world.	Yachanim kay pachapi aswan sumaq wawa kasqanmanta.
Too much to say.	Llumpay niyta.
I’ve seen that a half dozen times	Chayta huk kuskan chunka kutita rikurqani
I was worried all that morning	Chay tukuy paqarinmi llakisqa karqani
So now he preferred not to talk about it.	Chaymi kunanqa aswan allinpaq qhawarisqa mana chaymanta rimayta.
It's like the speaker of the week.	Chayqa semanapi rimaq hinam.
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Manam yachayta atirqanichu ima kasqanmanta
Amazing a first for me.	Admirakuypaqmi huk puntata ñuqapaq.
Don't you want that to happen.	Manachu munanki chayna kananta.
He thought it would help	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi yanapananta
He just told me.	Chayllam niwarqa.
But I can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I wasn’t the only one	Manam ñuqallachu karqani
I probably won’t do it again	Manapaschá hukmanta ruwasaqchu
I still wanted to know more.	Hinallam astawan yachayta munarqani.
It couldn’t be easier.	Manan aswan facilchu kanman.
I’ve been like this all along	Tukuy tiempon kay hina karqani
It was exactly what he wanted.	Chayqa karqa munasqanman hinam.
A little something for you	Huk chikan imapas qampaq
I couldn’t figure out what kind of stranger he was	Manam ima mana riqsisqa runa kasqanmanta yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I'm really not sure why.	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu kani imarayku.
I think he is right.	Payqa allintam rimachkan, nispaymi piensani.
I’m very, very good at it	Ancha, ancha allinmi kani chaypi
Who is that.	Pitaq chay.
I am so sorry that this is the case	Anchatam llakikuni kayna kasqanmanta
I never wanted to be serious about it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa serio kayta munarqanichu
I just saw him recently.	Chayllaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani.
It’s all right.	Lliwmi kachkan.
I did that once.	Chaytaqa huk kutim ruwarqani.
There is no point in talking about it.	Chaymanta rimayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
So we did a lot of that.	Chaymi chaytaqa achkata ruwarqayku.
I can’t sit still, anyway	Manam tiyayta atiymanchu, imayna kaptinpas
I was very stupid	Ancha sonso karqani
We're sure.	Seguro kayku.
He doesn’t think so.	Payqa manan chaytachu yuyaykun.
I want to do the right thing	Allin kaqta ruwayta munani
I was very happy with that	Chaywanmi ancha kusisqa karqani
I can't remember the first one	Ñawpaqtaqa manam yuyariyta atinichu
I couldn’t believe how successful he was	Mana creeyta atirqanichu allin ruwasqanmanta
He didn’t come here very often.	Payqa manan ancha sapa kutichu kayman hamuq.
It was hard, but we kept at it.	Sasam karqa, ichaqa hinallam ruwarqayku.
And now it would be two.	Hinaspa kunanqa iskay kanman.
Nothing new there.	Mana imapas musuq chaypiqa.
I didn’t realize that time would pass	Manam repararqanichu chay tiempo pasananta
The resident was gone, for now.	Chay tiyaq runaqa manañam karqachu, kunankamaqa.
I always thought so.	Sapa kutim chaynata piensarqani.
He wanted to ask her.	Payqa tapuyta munarqa.
Time to do what you do best.	Tiempo aswan allin ruwasqaykita ruwanaykipaq.
I think that looks good	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun nispam piensani
Things were really better.	Chiqaptam imapas aswan allin karqa.
He looks good really good.	Payqa allinmi chiqap allin rikchakun.
What’s more, you know it’s true.	Imataq aswan, yachanki chiqap kasqanmanta.
I went with it anyway	Imayna kaptinpas chaywanmi rirqani
I knew it was for me	Yacharqanim ñuqapaq kasqanmanta
I know you want this.	Yachanim kayta munasqaykita.
So they were all happy.	Chaymi llapallanku kusisqa karqaku.
We are people like him.	Pay hina runakunam kanchik.
I always like that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim gustan.
Everyone wants one.	Lliwmi hukta munanku.
I can’t really say.	Manam chiqaptachu niyta atiyman.
I know where you are	Yachanim maypi kasqaykita
And if not, why not?.	Hinaspa mana chayqa, ¿imaraykutaq mana?.
He knew he could do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I thought quickly.	Usqhaylla yuyaykurqani.
I couldn’t wait for him	Manam paytaqa suyayta atirqanichu
I am happy every day	Sapa punchawmi kusisqa kachkani
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna ruwayta.
I had to be ready, to be sure	Listo kanay karqa, seguro kanaypaq
I want to know about this happening.	Kay pasasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I hope he comes back	Suyachkani kutimunanta
I wasn’t good anywhere	Manam maypipas allinchu karqani
Not always, but always.	Mana sapa kutichu, aswanpas sapa kuti.
I still think he is gone	Hinallam piensani manaña kasqanmanta
Thank you, folks.	Gracias, runakuna.
He said, yes.	Payqa, arí nispas nisqa.
That’s why he’s.	Chayraykum payqa.
I can't do anything else	Manañam ima ruwaytapas atinichu
I thought you did something wrong or something	Yuyarqanim mana allinta ruwasqaykita utaq imapas
I know you’re doing the right thing	Yachanim allinta ruwasqaykita
You are very quick.	Qamqa ancha utqayllam kanki.
I can’t do that now	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa ruwaymanchu
I’m not happy every day	Manam sapa punchawchu kusisqa kani
I want to ask you about this	Kaymanta tapuyta munani
I wonder if it could be here	Tapukuni, kaypichu kanman nispa
Maybe he wasn’t happy	Ichapas mana kusisqachu karqa
I almost didn’t go to town	Yaqa mana llaqtaman rirqanichu
I feel so bad.	Ancha mana allintam sientekuni.
But sadly he is not alone.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi mana sapallanchu.
You are something.	Qamqa imapas kanki.
Wouldn’t that be nice?.	¿Manachu chayqa sumaq kanman?.
There he said they were not ready.	Chaypin nirqan mana listochu kasqankuta.
I doubt it.	Iskayrayani.
This is the best part here.	Kaymi kaypi aswan allin kaq.
I almost did it again	Yaqapaschá hukmanta ruwarqani
No one knows this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
He did this every night.	Chaytaqa sapa tutan ruwaq.
It doesn’t mean anything at all.	Manam imatapas niyta munanchu ni imapipas.
I never expected him to.	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu chayta ruwananta.
I think we just have to do it	Yuyaykuni chaylla ruwananchik tiyan
I couldn't bear to look at him anymore	Manañam aguantayta atirqanichu payta qawayta
I swam there every day	Chaypiqa sapa punchawmi nadaq kani
I think they’re ready now	Kunanqa listoña kasqankuta yuyaykuni
That worked out really well.	Chayqa ancha allintam lluqsirqa.
I still shouldn't be here	Kunankamapas manam kaypichu kanay
I wanted to fit in.	Chayman hina kaytam munarqani.
If you really want to.	Sichus chiqaptapuni munanki chayqa.
I’m feeling really good	Ñuqaqa chiqap allinmi kachkani
There is nothing about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kanchu.
I wasn’t ready for that yet	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi listochu karqani
I’m not good enough.	Mana allinchu kani.
They have always been there for me.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqapaq karqaku.
It didn’t go easy.	Manam facilchu pasarqa.
I saw no one, heard nothing	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu, manam imatapas uyarirqanichu
He would have to do something now.	Payqa kunanmi imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
He said he didn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu nirqan.
I want to walk there	Chaypi puriyta munani
You, me, everyone.	Qam, ñuqa, llapa runa.
They would be obvious.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi kanman.
I knew where he lived, now	Yacharqanim maypi yachasqanmanta, kunanqa
But it does the job well.	Ichaqa allintan chay llank’ayta ruwan.
I had never seen him there before	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa rikurqanichu
I can't drive anymore	Manañam carrota manejayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t say anything	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
I thought that was ugly, ugly	Chayqa millay, millay kananpaqmi piensarqani
I think you could have done better.	Yuyaykuni aswan allinta ruwawaq karqan.
I didn’t want that to be true.	Manam munarqanichu chay chiqap kananpaq.
I didn’t know you were here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqaykita
It has to be the last one.	Qhipa kaq kanan tiyan.
That couldn’t be worse.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu kanman.
Do this and that.	Kayta chayta ruway.
I want it there with me	Chaypim ñuqawan kuska munani
I know it will be good	Yachanim allin kananta
It’s like anything else.	Imapas hinam.
I think you’re one thing	Huk kaqmi kasqaykita yuyaykuni
But I can’t say	Ichaqa manan niyta atiymanchu
And I’m sorry about that.	Chaymanta llakikuni.
I couldn’t do this stuff	Manam kay imakunatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
Every day is the day.	Sapa punchawmi.
A lot of people agree with me.	Achka runakunam ñuqawan acuerdopi kanku.
They were beautiful.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi karqaku.
It should be later.	Qhepamanmi kanan.
But he kept going.	Ichaqa hinallam rirqa.
I am very happy about this.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta.
I’ll be crazy about you.	Qanmanta loco kasaq.
I didn’t see that coming	Manam chay hamunanta rikurqanichu
I had no idea he was that young.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna wayna kasqanmanta.
This went on most of the day.	Chayqa yaqa llapan punchawmi pasarqa.
However, things can go wrong.	Ichaqa, imapas mana allinchu kanman.
I listened but could not hear anyone	Uyarirqanim ichaqa manam pitapas uyariyta atirqanichu
I don't understand what's going on here.	Manam entiendenichu kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
That was a very good thing for him.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa paypaq.
She told me it was great and she was very happy.	Paymi niwarqa ancha allin hinaspa ancha kusisqa kasqanmanta.
I wonder how it will turn out	Tapukuni imaynataq kanqa nispa
I like doing that.	Chayta ruwayqa gustanmi.
Then, they had a great idea.	Chaymanta, huk hatun yuyayniyuq karqanku.
I couldn’t hear anything	Manam imatapas uyariyta atirqanichu
I already feel angry.	Ñam phiñasqa tarikuni.
That would have been the best thing to do.	Chayqa aswan allin ruwaymi kanman karqan.
However, it will be later.	Ichaqa, qhepamanmi kanqa.
I mean, everything	Niyta munani, tukuy imata
I told him he was crazy.	Loco kasqanmantam nirqani.
I don’t think of anything at all	Manam imatapas piensanichu ni imapipas
It seemed like something that mattered.	Chayqa imapas importante hinam karqa.
I never know how to fix this	Manam haykapipas yachanichu kayta imayna allichayta
That’s a very good, good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, allinmi.
I don’t want that	Manam munanichu chaytaqa
I never thought it would be me.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu ñuqa kananta.
I couldn’t sit here	Manam kaypi tiyayta atirqanichu
He couldn't hear everything.	Payqa manam tukuy imatapas uyariyta atirqachu.
It’s just too big.	Chaylla ancha hatunmi.
What’s the bad thing about it.	Imataq mana allin kaq.
And that was amazing.	Hinaspa chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I love it, too	Ñuqapas anchatam munani
I didn’t know how to ask	Manam tapuyta yacharqanichu
No one feels at home now.	Kunanqa manam pipas wasinpi hinachu kachkan.
Many people were terrified	Achka runakunam mancharisqa karqaku
He wasn’t really.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
Not a big deal, after all.	Mana hatun ruwaychu, tukuy imamanta.
I think he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
I wonder what he’ll do about it.	Tapukuni imatataq chaymanta ruwanqa nispa.
He is no longer sure of his place in the world.	Payqa manañan segurochu kashan kay pachapi maypi kasqanmanta.
I really want to do that	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta
Very often.	Ancha achka kuti.
So no one does anything to anyone.	Chaymi mana pipas pimanpas imatapas ruwanchu.
Both are extremely difficult.	Iskayninkum sinchi sasa kanku.
I know it’s going to happen	Yachanim chayna kananta
I feel like I have no idea.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikuni.
Now it was clear what had happened.	Kunanqa sut’inmi karqan imachus pasasqanmanta.
I want her to be as happy as she can be	Munani atisqanman hina kusisqa kananta
Can you beat it.	Atiwaqchu atipayta.
I’m so excited about it	Anchatam kusisqa kachkani
I know that kind of.	Yachanim chay laya.
I couldn't bear to look at him now	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu kunan payta qawayta
A few years younger than him	Paymanta iskay kimsa wata sullk’a
The first kindergarten.	Ñawpaq kaq wawa wasi.
He’s not a serious man.	Payqa manan serio runachu.
A couple of weeks ago approx.	Huk iskay semana ñawpaqta yaqa.
I knew what he was doing.	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta.
I have always thought.	Sapa kutim piensarqani.
He really wanted to talk to her today.	Payqa anchatan munarqan kunan p’unchay paywan rimayta.
I heard they were you know	Uyarirqanim kasqankuta yachanki
I need immediate help.	Chaylla yanapayta necesitasaq.
I do a lot of those things	Chaykunataqa achkatam ruwani
I was really worried about you, actually	Chiqamanta llakisqa karqani qammanta, chiqamanta
You and I, too.	Qampas ñuqapas.
Never mind how many there are.	Ama hayk’aqpas hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
Easy to make, easy to eat.	Mana sasachu ruwanapaq, mana sasachu mikhuy.
I know enough not to do that.	Chaytaqa mana ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani.
I knew it would be good	Yacharqanim allin kananta
Clearly something is very, very wrong there.	Sut’inmi chaypi imapas ancha, ancha mana allin kasqanmanta.
But I didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu.
I didn’t see anyone	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu
I couldn't remember who it was	Pi kasqanmantaqa manam yuyariyta atirqanichu
You know who you are.	Pi kasqaykita yachanki.
I wish he knew how to do it.	Munaymanmi imayna ruwayta yachananpaq.
I knew he wanted to do other things	Yacharqanim huk ruwaykunata ruwayta munasqanmanta
I’ve never seen that before.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu.
I just didn’t know what was wrong	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imachus mana allin kasqanmanta
I want to know more about this	Kaymantaqa astawan yachayta munani
He knew something was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas kananta.
I couldn't believe it would ever happen	Manam creeyta atirqanichu haykapipas chayna kananta
I’m going to be amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kasaq.
I will be there every night for ten hours	Chaypim sapa tuta chunka horasta chaypi kasaq
I'm really looking forward to it.	Chiqaptam chayta suyachkani.
Anyway, no big deal.	Imayna kaptinpas manam hatun ruwaychu.
I was still there.	Ñuqaqa hinallam karqani.
I usually do this the night before	Chaytaqa yaqa llapanpim ñawpaq tuta ruwani
I couldn’t figure that out	Manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I was so proud of him.	Anchatan paymanta orgulloso karqani.
I should be happy with that	Chaywanmi kusisqa kanay
I didn’t expect that	Chaytaqa manam suyarqanichu
There is no such thing as a statement.	Manam chayna nisqanqa kanchu.
We need to do this properly.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwananchik.
Tell me how it is for you.	Willaway imaynataq qampaq kasqanmanta.
I really don’t know what to do now	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu kunan imata ruwanayta
Now I have no choice	Kunanqa manañam ima ruwaytapas atinichu
They were very happy	Paykunaqa ancha kusisqam karqaku
I haven’t seen him in a long time	Unayñan mana rikurqanichu
I can’t wait for a night out	Manam suyayta atinichu huk tuta lluqsiyta
I cannot believe this.	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu.
He doesn’t sound good there at all.	Payqa manan allintachu chaypi uyarikun ni imapipas.
I'd rather be there if that happens.	Aswan allinmi kanman chaypi kaspa chayna kaptinqa.
Now I really hear it	Kunanqa chiqaptam uyarini
I know it was hard for him	Yachanim paypaq sasa kasqanmanta
I couldn’t figure out what was going on	Manam atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta
I didn’t want to see it	Manam qawayta munarqanichu
I can't believe anyone would do this	Manam creeyta atiymanchu pipas kayta ruwananta
Ten years easy.	Chunka wata facil.
We’ve been married for a long time now.	Unayñan casarasqa kayku kunanqa.
It’s a difficult problem	Sasa sasachakuy
I want him to know that	Chayta yachananta munani
I really think it's better.	Chiqaptam piensani aswan allin kasqanmanta.
Or tomorrow morning.	Utaq paqarin paqarin.
I didn’t want that	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu
I can’t think of it now	Manam kunanqa yuyaymanayta atinichu
Where you don’t want it to be.	Maypichus mana munankichu chaypi kananta.
Did the man look good.	Runa allinchu rikchakurqa.
With him.	Paywan.
So it was a good thing.	Chaymi allinpaq karqa.
I can’t eat anymore	Manañam mikuyta atinichu
I heard you were in town	Uyarirqanim llaqtapi kasqaykita
I probably won’t either	Ñuqapas manachá ruwasaqchu
I don’t need those things	Manam chaykunataqa necesitasaqchu
But there’s nothing here.	Ichaqa manan imapas kaypiqa kanchu.
I can’t sit here anymore	Manañam kaypi tiyayta atiymanchu
But, well, here it is.	Ichaqa, allinmi, kaypim kachkan.
More importantly, he’s the.	Aswan allinqa, payqa chay...
I felt happy.	Kusisqam tarikurqani.
I'm lucky.	Suerteyoqmi kani.
Building a school is the worst part.	Yachay wasi ruwaymi aswan mana allinqa.
I tried to do the right thing	Allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
I said, maybe tomorrow	nispaymi nirqani, ichapas paqarin
It seemed stupid, very stupid.	Sonso, ancha sonso hinam rikchakurqa.
Perhaps things should have been better now.	Ichapas kunanqa imapas allinchu kanan karqa.
No one could find it.	Manam pipas tariyta atirqachu.
I've got something.	Imatapas hap'ini.
This is obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi.
I always hope it happens	Sapa kutim suyachkani chayna kananta
It may not be the case.	Manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
I know all your thoughts in advance	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi tukuy ima yuyaykusqaykita yachani
But you are not like that person.	Ichaqa manan chay runa hinachu kanki.
Maybe a lot of it.	Ichapas achka.
I'm very proud of it	Anchatam orgulloso kani chaymanta
I can't remember where.	Maypi kasqanmantaqa manam yuyariyta atinichu.
Instead, I thought backwards.	Aswanpas qhepamanmi yuyaykurqani.
I know where it will be.	Yachanim maypi kananta.
I just wasn’t ready yet	Chayllaraqmi manaraq listochu karqani
There will be no other action.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanqachu.
I know where he is	Yachanim maypi kasqanmanta
I don’t like it now.	Kunanqa manam gustawanchu.
He obviously agreed	Payqa sut’inmi arí nisqa
That same evening.	Chay kikin chisi.
I thought maybe he was there	Yuyarqanim yaqapaschá payqa chaypi kachkarqa
It doesn’t matter anymore	Manañam imananpaschu
But, you can never predict them.	Ichaqa, manan hayk’aqpas chaykunataqa willayta atiwaqchu.
And whoever it may be.	Hinaspa pichus kanman chayta.
I want to think this through	Kayta allinta yuyaymanayta munani
A good man in this good world	Kay allin pachapi allin runa
I can’t handle that yet	Chaytaqa manaraqmi aguantayta atinichu
The oldest one will ever be.	Aswan kuraq kaqmi hayk’aqpas kanqa.
I never noticed it	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu
I don’t feel so comfortable.	Manam chayna allinchu tarikuni.
I haven’t seen anyone there in a long time	Unayñan mana pitapas chaypiqa rikunichu
Really bad weather.	Chiqap mana allin pacha.
I will certainly do it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwasaq.
I think that’s the best way	Chayqa aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykuni
What’s more, you may not know why.	Imataq aswan, manapaschá yachankichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That seems obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi rikch’akun.
So, yeah, there was something there.	Chaymi, arí, chaypi imapas karqa.
I knew he would come back	Yacharqanim kutimunanta
You are so much like me.	Qamqa anchatam ñuqa hina kanki.
That’s what he wants to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munan.
I still didn’t know anything	Kunankamapas manam imatapas yacharqanichu
Do it, baby, do it.	Ruway wawa, ruway.
I think he is handsome	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensani
To speak the language.	Chay simita rimananpaq.
I hadn’t been there in a long time	Unayñan mana chaypichu karqani
If something goes wrong.	Sichus imapas mana allinchu kanman chayqa.
I couldn’t keep up with him, but I don’t care	Manam paywan kuska puriyta atirqanichu, ichaqa manam imananpaschu
Make things right.	Imakunatapas allinta ruway.
Now, it hardly seemed right.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
The next thing is.	Qatiqnin kaq.
You’re not going to do that.	Manam chaytachu ruwanki.
Now tell me what you want.	Kunanqa willaway ima munasqaykita.
It was rather lonely.	Aswan sapallanmi karqa.
I knew what they were like	Yacharqanim imayna kasqankuta
Maybe there’s nothing there.	Ichapas chaypiqa mana imapas kanchu.
It’s not good, it’s not bad.	Manam allinchu, manam mana allinchu.
This was not difficult.	Kayqa manam sasachu karqa.
I didn’t know what to do with it.	Manam yacharqanichu chaywan imata ruwanaypaq.
I really had no choice	Chiqaptaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I almost didn’t want to find it anymore	Yaqapaschá manaña tariyta munarqanichu
At least, it’s not like this.	Aswanpas, manan kay hinachu.
I didn’t expect him to be a villain	Manam suyarqanichu millay runa kananta
I was very famous that morning	Chay paqarinmi ancha riqsisqa karqani
He said something to her.	Payqa imatapas nirqam.
I do everything hard	Tukuy imatam sinchita ruwani
I had to act immediately	Chayllam imatapas ruwanay karqa
I was stupid, very stupid	Ñuqaqa sonso karqani, ancha sonso
That’s what’s there.	Chayqa chaypi kaqmi.
I can't wait to see it next year.	Manam suyayta atinichu hamuq wata qawayta.
And now that’s it.	Hinaspa kunanqa chayna.
Don’t be crazy.	Ama loco kaychu.
I’m sorry, but he can’t.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa manan atinchu.
I want to be there.	Chaypi kaytam munani.
So that was a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa allin karqa.
I know how things are.	Yachanim imapas imayna kasqanmanta.
Probably nothing.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas.
I can’t ask that of him.	Chaytaqa manan paymanta tapuyta atiymanchu.
That would never be a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
I would love to go with you	Anchatan munani qanwan riyta
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatam munarqa.
I think my timing was bad	Yuyaykuni tiempoy mana allinchu karqan
But the truth is the truth.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi cheqaq kaq.
We are sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkaniku.
I didn't know anyone else was here	Manam yacharqanichu pipas huk kaypi kasqanmanta
He did a good job of that.	Payqa allin chayta ruwarqa.
I want to make him mine	Paytaqa ñuqapa kananpaqmi ruwayta munani
All of this is neither here nor there.	Tukuy kaykunaqa manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
That’s what I want to be for you	Chayna kaytam munani qampaq
That was the last step.	Chayqa qhepa kaq ruwaymi karqan.
I can’t have sex with you	Manam qamwan puñuyta atiymanchu
He didn’t know what to expect.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus suyasqanmanta.
I still didn't know what he was doing, what he was doing	Kunankamapas manam yacharqanichu ima ruwasqanmanta, ima ruwasqanmanta
I didn’t want money	Manam qullqita munarqanichu
I don’t know who he is.	Manam yachanichu pi kasqanmantaqa.
I just feel sorry for him	Paymanta llakikuni chaylla
I am a real person.	Chiqap runam kani.
I thought it was the latter	Chay qhepa kaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
Soon he would have no choice.	Pisi tiempollamantan manaña ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu karqan.
He couldn’t know, he didn’t care to know.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu, manan imananpaschu yachananpaq.
It didn't work out that well.	Manam chayna allintachu lluqsirqa.
And he told me so.	Hinaspa chaynata niwarqa.
I couldn't say what it was like	Manam niyta atirqanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa
He wants to get out of there.	Chaymanta lluqsiyta munan.
I didn’t know he would	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwananta
Twice the size.	Iskay kuti aswan hatun.
A very famous person.	Ancha riqsisqa runa.
I can’t sleep	Manam puñuyta atinichu
He was angry.	Payqa phiñasqa.
But I can’t help it	Ichaqa manan yanapayta atiymanchu
I think this is the right time	Kaymi allin tiempo kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
But now it was very unlikely.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha manapaschá chay hinachu karqan.
I couldn’t get to it	Manam chayayta atirqanichu
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu.
This was a good thing, he was sure.	Kayqa allinmi karqa, chaymantam seguro karqa.
I really wanted to help	Anchatam yanapayta munarqani
I wanted to know everything	Tukuy imamanta yachayta munarqani
Hopefully it never happens	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas chayna kananta
But that’s all.	Ichaqa chayllam.
It was never going to be the same.	Manan hayk’aqpas huk hinachu kanan karqan.
I am very happy with that	Chaywanmi ancha kusisqa kachkani
I can’t think anymore.	Manañam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I wanted to be older	Kuraq kaytam munarqani
But then something else happened.	Ichaqa chaymantam huk imapas pasarqa.
I could never make it happen	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaypaqqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I was a little surprised but happy.	Huk chhikantan admirakurqani ichaqa kusisqan tarikurqani.
I can't believe he's really gone	Manam creeyta atinichu chiqaptapuni manaña kasqanmantaqa
I know I can’t.	Yachanim mana atisqayta.
There is no third person.	Manam kimsa kaq runa kanchu.
I know it's not that hard for you	Yachanim mana chayna sasachu qampaq kasqanmanta
It wasn’t that good.	Manam chayna allinchu karqa.
He new knows what to do.	Payqa musuq yachan ima ruwananta.
Sick, you know.	Unqusqa, yachanki.
I just couldn’t seem to help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atirqanichu hina.
A day trip, unlike me	Huk punchaw puriq, mana ñuqa hinachu
I didn’t know if it was right	Manam yacharqanichu allinchu kasqanmantaqa
I’ve been thinking about it for a long time	Unayñan yuyaykurqani
This actually happened to me.	Kayqa chiqaptam ñuqawan pasarqa.
I didn’t really know what it was	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima kasqanmantaqa
You are here, it is there.	Qamqa kaypim kachkanki, chaypim kachkan.
This statement is obviously not true.	Kay nisqanqa sut’inmi mana cheqaqchu.
I didn’t mean it was true	Manam chiqap kasqanmantam niyta munarqani
I didn’t really want you to be there	Manam anchatachu munarqani chaypi kasqaykita
It just can’t be you.	Chaylla mana qam kayta atiwaqchu.
I knew you wanted me to be successful	Yacharqanim allin kanaypaq munasqaykita
Now I question everything	Kunanqa tukuy imatam tapukuni
Went very well.	Rirqa ancha allinta.
The best thing is just that.	Aswan allinqa chaylla.
Go! 	¡Riy!
I didn’t know you were scared	Manam yacharqanichu mancharisqa kasqaykita
I didn't see him all day	Tukuy punchawmi mana paytaqa rikurqanichu
He was there today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi chaypi karqa.
Obviously he’s working.	Sut’inmi payqa llank’ashan.
I really really don’t want to know.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta mana yachayta munanichu.
This way it was better.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi karqan.
I just never saw this or noticed this before	Chayllaraqmi mana hayk’aqpas kayta rikurqanichu nitaq kayta repararqanichu ñawpaqtaqa
glad I’m not the only one.	kusisqa mana ñuqallachu kani.
I knew what it was like	Yacharqanim imayna kasqanmanta
If not better.	Mana aswan allin kaptinqa.
It wasn’t real! 	¡Manan cheqaqchu karqan!
I thought it was funny	Ñuqaqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani
But you didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqankichu.
Is this a good thing.	¿Allinchu kayqa.
I really didn’t notice.	Chiqaptaqa manam repararqanichu.
I didn't know how long it was	Manam yacharqanichu hayka tiempo kasqanmantaqa
I couldn’t get over it.	Manam chaymantaqa atipayta atirqanichu.
I didn’t want to ask that	Manam chayta tapuyta munarqanichu
Like, really, really good.	Imayna, chiqap, chiqap allin.
But it wasn’t funny.	Ichaqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
I hope there are more to come.	Suyachkani aswan achka hamunanta.
Said he didn't know much about it.	Nirqa manam anchatachu chaymanta yachan.
I don't know why	Manam yachanichu imarayku kasqanmantaqa
And then, a funny thing happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta, huk asikunapaq kaq pasarqa.
I enjoy most of it	Yaqa llapanpim kusikuni
He didn’t know her name.	Payqa manan sutinta yacharqanchu.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinmanchu.
I am very happy with that	Chaywanmi anchata kusikuni
This is a very difficult task.	Kayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
I didn't think that was the case	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
I want to be there now	Kunanqa chaypi kaytam munani
What it is to be human	Runa kay ima kasqanmanta
I think he likes it	Payqa gustanmi nispaymi piensani
I couldn’t see any other solution.	Mana huk allichayta rikuyta atirqanichu.
I know he can do more	Yachanim aswan ruwayta atisqanmanta
So it’s a good thing.	Chaymi allinmi.
And a terrible man.	Hinaspa manchay runa.
I’m still going to be.	Hinallam kachkani.
I didn’t want to hear it anymore	Manañam uyariyta munarqanichu
So, he wanted to do it fast.	Chaymi, utqaylla ruwayta munarqa.
There you will live.	Chaypim yachanki.
I couldn’t wait to go outside	Manam suyayta atirqanichu hawaman riyta
I've never heard of this before.	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu kaymantaqa.
I hope you can’t	Suyachkani mana atisqaykita
I can't understand why	Manam entiendeyta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I know everything about him	Paymanta tukuy imata yachani
I can't wait to talk to you	Manam suyayta atiymanchu qamwan rimayta
I want to help with this	Kaypi yanapayta munani
I was just going to keep going	Ñoqaqa hinallam karqani
I had to disagree with this	Kaytaqa manam acuerdopichu kanay karqa
And we agree on that.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa acuerdopi kayku.
That it is no longer the case.	Manaña chayna kasqanmanta.
I felt good anyway	Imayna kaptinpas allintam tarikurqani
I have no idea what to do.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ruwanaypaq.
He said he didn't want one.	Payqa manam hukta munanichu nispa.
It was very nice though.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan ichaqa.
A lot of people were worried about you.	Achka runakunam llakisqa karqanki.
I want alone time with you	Qanwan sapallay tiempota munani
He learned quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan yacharqan.
He should be fired.	Payqa qarqusqa kanan.
He didn't mean anything by it.	Payqa manan chaywanqa imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
I didn’t think about anything	Manam imapipas piensarqanichu
I don’t want to drive.	Manam manejayta munanichu.
I was happy to be there	Kusisqam karqani chaypi kasqaymanta
I still have time	Hinallam tiempoy kan
I’ve done that a few times	Chaytaqa iskay kinsa kutitan ruwarqani
He would probably do that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanman.
There is nothing like it.	Manan imapas chay hinaqa kanchu.
I actually saw him last night	Qayna tutam chiqap payta rikurqani
We can't do anything tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
They want the wrong thing.	Mana allintam munanku.
No, that doesn’t make sense.	Manan, chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I want you to be with me	Ñoqaqa munani ñoqawan kanaykita
I wanted to say something, something	Imatapas, imatapas niyta munarqani
I just didn’t know how to tell it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynatachus willayta
I think he was very scared	Yuyaykuni ancha mancharisqa kasqanmanta
He never wants to talk to me again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas ñoqawan rimayta munanchu.
They were tired.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqa karqanku.
I don’t think I’m going to be famous	Manam piensanichu riqsisqa kanaypaq
An innocent morning.	Huk mana huchayoq paqarin.
And one of them is hurt.	Hinaspa hukninmi k’irisqa kashan.
But he doesn’t do that anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chayta ruwanchu.
You don’t know how he feels.	Manan yachankichu imayna sientekusqanmanta.
This was so wrong.	Kayqa chaymi mana allinchu karqa.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
But now tell me something else.	Kunanmi ichaqa hukta willaway.
Maybe a week.	Ichapas huk semana.
It really should be.	Chiqaptam kanan.
A few hours ago.	Iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqta.
It's a difficult day.	Sasa punchaw.
He is the best thing that has happened to me.	Payqa aswan allin kaqmi ñuqapaq pasasqanmanta.
No, he wanted to say.	Manan, nispas niyta munarqan.
I never thought of it that way	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa piensarqanichu
I'm going to take a walk today.	Kunan punchawmi huk puriyta ruwasaq.
It seems like anyone would do it.	Chayqa pipas ruwanman hinam.
I don’t find it to be a problem.	Manam tarinichu sasachakuy kananpaq.
I know what he can do	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta
I can’t imagine how hard it would be now.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinichu kunan imayna sasa kanman chayta.
We're not sure which one it is.	Manam segurochu kayku mayqin kasqanmantaqa.
I haven't been there in a couple of years	Iskay kimsa watañam mana chaypichu kachkani
I was so excited about it	Ñuqaqa ancha kusisqam karqani
I knew what he was doing	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta
You’ve obviously done that.	Sut’inmi chayta ruwarqanki.
That person could be out there doing stupid things.	Chay runaqa chay hawapi kanman sonso ruwaykunata ruwaspa.
Yes, he knew that.	Arí, chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
But things went wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
But you never know what’s going to happen.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus pasananta.
That's never going to happen.	Chayqa mana hayk'aqpas kanqachu.
I know what they are like	Yachanim imayna kasqankuta
I didn’t do much of anything this morning	Kunan paqarinmi mana anchatachu imatapas ruwarqani
Even if he wasn’t there with me.	Mana ñuqawan chaypi kaptinpas.
I know it's very stupid	Yachanim ancha sonso kasqanmanta
Now I know this is what he wants for me	Kunanmi yachani kayta ñuqapaq munasqanmanta
That might be what you want.	Chayqa ichapas munasqayki kanman.
And then, he was gone.	Hinaspa chaymanta, manaña karqachu.
I knew you wouldn't be here long	Yacharqanim mana unaytachu kaypi kanaykita
I knew what was going on.	Ñuqaqa yacharqanim imakuna pasasqanmanta.
It’s great to be here.	Ancha allinmi kaypi kayqa.
I really like it here	Kaypiqa anchatam gustan
I don’t know, man.	Manam yachanichu, runa.
It’s not worth it.	Mana valenchu.
I don't know how long it actually took	Manam yachanichu hayka tiempo chiqap pasasqanmanta
So that's the reality.	Chaymi chaymi chiqap kaq.
They know who they are.	Paykunaqa yachanku pikuna kasqankuta.
I didn’t want to be in school	Manam escuelapi kayta munarqanichu
I’m just so worried.	Chaylla ancha llakisqa kachkani.
I had never seen it either	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas rikurqanichu
That would have been a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan kanman karqan.
You’re just like me.	Qamqa ñuqa hinam kanki.
I know exactly what happened	Allintam yachani imakuna pasasqanmanta
I always did the right thing	Sapa kutim allin kaqta ruwaq kani
Something about what he did.	Imapas chay ruwasqanmanta.
He just couldn’t.	Chaylla mana atirqachu.
So, very much so.	Chaymi, anchata.
I know you know how it is	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta yachasqaykita
I wish it wasn’t	Mana chayna kananta munayman
It didn’t do very well.	Manam ancha allintachu ruwarqa.
I don't think that's the case	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu
I had no idea what it would be like.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna kananta.
I am a very, very mean person.	Ancha ancha millay runam kani.
I knew what he could do	Yacharqanim ima ruway atisqanmanta
It could be less.	Aswan pisi kanman.
That's how I can describe it.	Chaynatam willayta atiyman.
That man is truly the best.	Chay runaqa chiqaptam aswan allinqa.
He told me what he needed.	Paymi niwarqa imakuna necesitasqanmanta.
It wasn’t supposed to be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
I mean, you can’t answer.	Niyta munani, mana kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
Now it was still the same.	Kunanqa hinallam karqa.
That’s actually the best thing for me.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa aswan allinmi ñuqapaq.
Anything more.	Imapas aswan.
I just didn’t know why	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imarayku
He didn’t want to hear that.	Payqa manan chayta uyariyta munarqanchu.
Thanks again!!.	Yapamanta gracias!!.
I didn’t want to be that person	Manam chay runa kaytaqa munarqanichu
I didn’t know something like that would happen	Manam yacharqanichu chayna imapas pasananta
I was pretty sure no one knew much about him	Yaqa segurom karqani mana pipas paymanta anchata yachasqanmanta
Maybe he knows what he’s doing	Ichapas payqa yachan ima ruwasqanmanta
I saw him about a week ago	Yaqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani
Yes, he could not see it.	Arí, manam rikuyta atirqachu.
I never had to repeat the process either	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas chay ruwayta yapamanta ruwanay karqanchu
It could be worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman.
You’re an adult.	Kuraq runam kanki.
This is a man.	Kayqa runa.
That’s what he had to do.	Chaynatam ruwanan karqa.
Nobody likes that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas gustanchu.
He died a year later.	Huk wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
However, they are very interesting.	Ichaqa, ancha sumaqmi kanku.
I’ve been fine for a long time.	Unayñan allin kashani.
I just learned how important it is	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani ancha allin kasqanmanta
I was a good teacher.	Allin yachachiqmi karqani.
I wonder why he was here	Tapukuni imanasqataq kaypi karqa
And this is a big one.	Hinaspa kayqa hatunmi.
I was three hours ago	Kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi karqani
The person can do whatever he wants with it.	Chay runaqa munasqanman hinam chaywanqa ruwanman.
I plan to leave tomorrow	Paqarinmi ripuyta yuyaykuni
That would be easier for me.	Chayqa aswan facilmi ñuqapaq kanman.
Again, not the best day.	Yapamanta, mana aswan allin p’unchawchu.
I really, really do.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam ruwani.
I really didn’t want to go	Chiqaptaqa manam riyta munarqanichu
I never wanted that to happen	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu chayna kananta
He’d caught her before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi hap’isqa.
An .	Huk .
Obviously I want to know why.	Sut’inmi yachayta munani imarayku chayta.
I don’t know, maybe it needs more time.	Mana yachanichu, ichapas aswan tiempota necesitan.
For the most part, it was.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna karqa.
It makes a good ride a good ride.	Allin puriyta allin puriyta ruwan.
I didn’t know what it was about	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta
That wasn’t always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina karqan.
It did very, very well.	Ancha, ancha allintam ruwarqa.
And you out there with him.	Hinaspa qam chay hawapi paywan kuska.
I certainly did that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqani.
She knows he wants her.	Payqa allintam yachan payta munasqanmanta.
I couldn’t do that to him	Chaytaqa manan paytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
Maybe he could have.	Ichapas payqa atinman karqa.
But he is not like me.	Ichaqa manan ñoqa hinachu.
Not better, not worse.	Mana aswan allinchu, mana aswan mana allinchu.
He always seemed to.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi rikchakurqa.
I wanted to be wrong	Pantasqa kaytam munarqani
I did well there	Chaypiqa allintam ruwarqani
I couldn’t answer right away	Manam chaylla kutichiyta atirqanichu
Very much like him.	Ancha pay hina.
I thought that would be great	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani
He thinks he’s a tough guy.	Payqa sinchi runa kananpaqmi yuyaykun.
A good man, but he couldn't swim	Allin runa, ichaqa manam nadayta atirqachu
There was nowhere left.	Chaypiqa manañam maypipas karqachu.
I didn’t mean that or anything	Manam chaytachu nitaq imatapas niyta munarqanichu
We’ve been here a long time.	Unayñam kaypi kachkaniku.
It's the best thing that ever happened to him.	Chayqa aswan allin kaqmi paywan pasasqanmantaqa.
We’ve had some great success early on.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi wakin hatun allinta ruwarqayku.
I have no idea where it is	Manam maypi kasqanmanta yuyayniyuqchu kani
Now I have a mind to do it.	Kunanqa ruwanaypaq yuyayniyuqmi kani.
Most of what he says is sadly true.	Yaqa llapan nisqanqa llakikuypaqmi chiqap.
That would be a good thing, he said.	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispa.
I wasn’t sure it was true	Manam segurochu karqani chiqap kasqanmanta
All year round.	Tukuy wata.
Do it if you think it will work for you.	Chayta ruway sichus qanpaq allin kananta yuyaykunki chayqa.
He says nothing happened.	Paymi nin mana imapas pasasqanmanta.
Better.	Aswan allin.
I want it, you want it	Ñoqaqa munani, qanmi munanki
I couldn’t understand him	Paytaqa manam entiendeyta atirqanichu
I listened carefully	Allintam uyarirqani
And they want it.	Hinaspa paykunaqa munanku.
Maybe he went to your house afterwards	Ichapas wasiykiman rirqa chaymanta
To do otherwise would be to take too long.	Mana chayta ruwayqa llumpay unayta ruwaymi kanman.
I couldn’t let anything happen to her	Manam imatapas paywan pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I know you have to do this alone	Yachanim sapallayki kayta ruwanayki kasqanmanta
That’s why people want them anyway.	Chayraykum runakunaqa imayna kaptinpas chaykunataqa munanku.
I heard it.	Uyarirqanim.
All residential.	Tukuy tiyaq.
So do that and do it.	Chaymi chaynata ruway.
This was to be done twice a day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi iskay kutita ruwana karqa.
I didn’t hear it right	Manam allintachu uyarirqani
I had a fantastic day, actually	Ñuqaqa huk sumaq punchawmi karqani, chiqaptaqa
I know there is someone else	Yachanim huk runa kasqanmanta
That's what I really like about you	Chayqa anchatam gustan qammanta
I knew something had happened	Yacharqanim imapas pasasqanmanta
Last night was the last I saw of him	Qayna tutan qhepa kaq payta rikurqani
I can’t let it go	Manam saqiyta atiymanchu ripuyta
And it was supposed to be.	Hinaspa chayna kanan karqa.
I couldn’t understand how that happened	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imayna chay pasasqanmanta
I heard about it this morning	Kunan paqarinmi chaymanta uyarirqani
It needs a door.	Huk punkuta necesitan.
I wasn’t that surprised	Manam chaynatachu admirakurqani
If you are unsure, say so.	Mana seguro kaptinqa chayta niy.
I, however, could do nothing	Ñoqa ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I was a terrible person	Ñuqaqa manchay runam karqani
They are really enjoying themselves.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kashanku.
Do.	Ruway.
He can’t answer	Payqa manan kutichiyta atinchu
Say something new you learned.	Imatapas musuq yachasqaykita niy.
He came again.	Yapamanta hamurqa.
I didn’t want to know if he was serious	Manam yachayta munarqanichu serio kasqanmanta
Maybe, maybe not.	Ichapas, manapaschá.
Being very serious.	Ancha serio kay.
And sure enough, that.	Hinaspa seguro, chayta.
He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.
I wanted it so badly	Sinchitan munarqani
I hope nothing happens	Suyachkani mana imapas pasananta
I couldn’t do this anymore	Manañam kayta ruwayta atirqanichu
He was quick and smart.	Payqa utqaylla hinaspa yachaysapa kasqa.
But he can’t stay for very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu qhepakuyta atin.
Actually, that wasn't a bad thing.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
He's not there tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam chaypichu kachkan.
I just couldn’t sit with him	Chaylla mana paywan tiyayta atirqanichu
I really feel sad again	Chiqaptam hukmanta llakisqa tarikuni
I didn’t think he could do that.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna ruwayta atisqanmanta.
And again and again.	Hinaspa yapamanta yapamanta.
I think that's a good thing	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam piensani
I was crazy about him	Paymanta loco karqani
I don’t have time for that.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempoy kanchu.
I don’t know what that is	Manam yachanichu imataq chay kasqanmantaqa
I knew it would never work out	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas allin kananta
I won't be able to help here	Kaypiqa manam yanapayta atisaqchu
I can’t watch it anymore	Manañam qawayta atinichu
He had a very bad game today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha mana allin pukllayta ruwarqa.
I really have no idea how	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynatachus chayta
He was very badly injured.	Payqa ancha sinchitan k’irisqa karqan.
It was unfortunate, and he was right.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa, payqa allintam nirqa.
I cannot stand being alone	Sapallan kaytaqa manam aguantayta atinichu
I seem to have done well	Ñoqapas allintan ruwarqani hina
And, in fact, this is it.	Hinaspa, chiqaptaqa, kaymi.
But very quickly.	Ichaqa ancha utqaylla.
I didn’t feel like I was alone	Manam sapallay hinachu chaytaqa piensarqani
He looked tired and exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqa sayk’usqa qhawarisqa.
I can’t be nice.	Manam sumaq kayta atiymanchu.
But everything is fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
Some people at least.	Wakin runakunaqa aswanpas.
You are a very good person.	Qamqa ancha allin runam kanki.
I couldn’t be happier, really	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa
It wasn't too bad of a weekend.	Manam ancha mana allinchu karqa huk semana tukuyta.
I can’t ignore that	Chaytaqa manam mana uyariyta atiymanchu
Many people agree with you	Achka runakunam qamwan acuerdopi kanku
Obviously, that wasn’t true.	Sut’inmi, chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
It was actually nice.	Chiqaptaqa sumaqmi karqa.
We have no idea what happened.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanchik imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Anything according to that.	Imapas chayman hina.
He knew he wasn't thinking straight.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allintachu yuyaykushasqanmanta.
One day, one year, ten years	Huk punchaw, huk wata, chunka wata
That’s obviously the best.	Chayqa sut’inmi aswan allinqa.
Good is not good.	Allinqa manam allinchu.
I am happier now	Kunanqa aswan kusisqam kachkani
Too much time.	Llumpay tiempo.
I want to know more.	Astawan yachayta munani.
It happened ten years ago.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
I'm so sorry, folks	Anchatam llakikuni, runakuna
I wasn’t going anywhere so it wasn’t a big deal.	Manam maymanpas rirqanichu chaymi mana hatun ruwaychu karqa.
That was you guys.	Chayqa qanmi karqanki.
I had no idea anything was that bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
And hidden.	Hinaspa pakasqa.
I wish I could, though.	Munaymanmi, ichaqa.
I can’t imagine how it feels for you	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imayna qampaq sientekusqanmanta
I knew for certain that this was the right thing to do	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam allinta yacharqani
Boy, could he talk.	Wayna, rimayta atinmanchu karqan.
I can’t walk anymore	Manañam puriyta atinichu
I think you’ve done it here	Kaypi ruwasqaykita yuyani
Perhaps for the better.	Ichapas allinpaq.
I can’t do it any other way	Manam huk hina ruwayta atiymanchu
I thought it might be yours	Yuyarqanim ichapas qampa kanman nispa
I know how hard it is.	Yachanim chayna sasa kasqanmanta.
So a lot of action.	Chaymi achka ruway.
But that’s what came.	Ichaqa chaymi hamurqan.
I never wanted to leave	Manam haykapipas ripuyta munarqanichu
He says the truth.	Payqa chiqaptam nin.
I have no idea who he is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani pi kasqanmanta
Everyone is there.	Lliwmi chaypi kachkanku.
I didn’t see what it was	Manam rikurqanichu ima kasqanmanta
The most beautiful that.	Aswan sumaq chay.
First an hour, then two, then three.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk hora, chaymanta iskay, chaymanta kimsa.
But he will be caught.	Ichaqa hap’isqa kanqa.
Good appearance.	Allin rikchayniyuq.
Unique.	Sapa.
I couldn't see who it was	Manam qawayta atirqanichu pi kasqanmanta
It has to be in the house somewhere.	Maypipas wasipi kanan tiyan.
A lot of people were here	Achka runakunam kaypi karqaku
I was depressed there	Chaypim llakisqa karqani
I was never very good either	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas ancha allinchu karqani
I couldn't say what was in it	Manam niyta atirqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmantaqa
I want to know what is going on.	Imakuna kasqanmantam yachayta munani.
I couldn’t talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
I thought it would be good.	Allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
I didn't think about it that way.	Manam chaynataqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
But this doesn’t seem like it’s going to be easy.	Ichaqa kayqa manan facilchu kanqa hinachu.
Again, nothing wrong with that.	Yapamanta, mana ima mana allinchu chaypiqa.
Someone knows the solution.	Pipas yachan chay allichayta.
He knew it well enough.	Allintam yacharqa.
I don't remember it ever being this good.	Manam yuyarinichu haykapipas kayna allin kasqanmanta.
You know it’s me.	Yachankim ñuqa kasqayta.
I hope today is easy for you	Suyachkani kunan punchaw qampaq facil kananpaq
I don’t want it anymore.	Manañam munanichu.
I knew there was a lot.	Yacharqanim achka kasqanmanta.
I don’t want to answer right away	Manam munanichu chaylla kutichiyta
These were really good people here.	Kaykunaqa kaypi chiqap allin runakunam karqaku.
I wanted to get out of here	Kaymanta lluqsiyta munarqani
I couldn't leave it out there like that	Manam chaynataqa chay hawapi saqiyta atirqanichu
A girl opened the door	Huk sipasmi punkuta kicharirqa
I can wait longer	Aswan unayta suyayta atiyman
I was never good enough	Manam haykapipas allinchu karqani
Perhaps that is how he felt.	Yaqapaschá chayna tarikurqa.
It was his first year in high school.	Colegiopi ñawpaq kaq wata karqa.
It doesn't get any better than this.	Kaymantaqa manam aswan allinchu.
This is a difficult task.	Kayqa sasa ruwaymi.
Someone is doing it.	Pipas chayta ruwachkan.
He doesn’t know how good it is.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna allin kasqanta.
But this morning it was certain, never before.	Ichaqa kunan paqarinmi seguro karqan, mana hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa.
We’re better than this, people.	Kaymantaqa aswan allinmi kayku, runakuna.
I was late but here it was.	Tarde karqani ichaqa kaypim karqa.
He meant a lot by that.	Payqa anchatam chaywanqa niyta munarqa.
But he knew you were gone.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi manaña kasqaykita.
I was really surprised	Chiqaptam admirakurqani
I want to understand that	Chayna kasqanmantam entiendeyta munani
He was as angry as he was frightened.	Payqa mancharisqa hina phiñasqa kasqa.
I was a little disappointed	Huk chhikantan hukmanyasqa tarikurqani
I just didn’t know what you were thinking about this	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu kaypi yuyaykusqaykita
I couldn’t get over it.	Manam atipayta atirqanichu.
No one knows his real name.	Manan pipas yachanchu cheqaq sutinta.
Two, no, three people.	Iskay, mana, kimsa runa.
He was actually a good guy.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allin runam karqa.
Now he would have to do something.	Kunanqa imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
Now I do it.	Kunanqa ruwani.
I will probably always be	Yaqapaschá sapa kutilla chayna kasaq
I’ve always been like that.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutillanmi chayna karqani.
I can't take it that way	Manam chaynatachu hapiyta atiyman
So, if anything.	Chaymi, imapas kaptinqa.
I didn't realize how quickly the day passed	Manam repararqanichu chay punchaw chaylla pasasqanmanta
I wanted to be better at something, for once	Imapipas aswan allinta ruwayta munarqani, huk kutilla
I was ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam karqani.
He's really excited.	Payqa chiqaptam kusisqa kachkan.
I was the speaker.	Ñuqam rimaq karqani.
Don’t you think that’s a funny story.	¿Manachu chaytaqa asikunapaq hina willakuyta yuyanki.
I didn’t expect that	Chaytaqa manan suyarqanichu
But no one knows that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa yachanchu.
I think it's beautiful	Sumaq kasqanmantam piensani
I never heard from him again	Manam haykapipas hukmanta uyarirqanichu
I couldn’t be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu.
Being a real person is the best thing.	Chiqap runa kaymi aswan allinqa.
He's the youngest.	Payqa sullk'a kaqmi.
He knew very well.	Ancha allintam yacharqa.
Good, good, good.	Allin, allin, allin.
I don’t know what he meant	Manam yachanichu ima nisqanta
Then again, probably not.	Chaymanta yapamanta, manapaschá.
This has been going on for a long time.	Kayqa unayñam kachkan.
At least, he was pretty sure.	Aswanpas, payqa allintan seguro kasharqan.
But we did, and everything went well.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqayku, tukuy imapas allintan rirqan.
I think that is a sure thing	Chayqa huk seguro kasqanmantam piensani
But he was a tougher man.	Ichaqa payqa aswan sinchi runan karqan.
I wasn't sure why	Manam segurochu karqani imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
Again, no thanks.	Yapamanta, mana gracias.
I didn’t want to come.	Manam hamuyta munarqanichu.
I want some things	Wakin imakunatapas munani
But very, very quickly.	Ichaqa ancha, ancha utqaylla.
I thought everything was fine	Tukuy imapas allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
I tried to convince him	Payta convencechiyta munarqani
A single child.	Huk sapallan wawa.
I thought, nothing really	Yuyarqanim, manam imapas chiqaptaqa
I knew you were the one, you were the one	Yacharqanim qam chay kasqaykita, qam chay kaq kasqaykita
I wonder why he does that	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwan
She looked so nice	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa
I didn’t know you were going to do this now	Manam yacharqanichu kunan kayta ruwanaykita
He does these things well.	Chaykunataqa allintam ruwan.
I couldn’t bear to hang out with you and her	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu qanwan paywan kuska puriyta
I know you know that though	Yachanim ichaqa chayta yachasqaykita
There was nothing about the date.	Ima punchaw kasqanmantaqa manam imapas karqachu.
Maybe that’s all.	Ichapas chaylla.
I had to do the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwanay karqa.
It was very funny.	Ancha asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I’m not going to do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
Everything was new.	Tukuy imapas musuq kaqmi karqa.
If only it had been nice.	Sichus sumaq kanman karqan chayqa.
I guess I’m half human.	Suyachkani kuskan runa kasqayta.
What a beautiful man.	Ima sumaq runa.
That’s what he wanted to hear.	Chaytan payqa uyariyta munarqan.
Yes, thank you.	Arí, gracias.
It was certainly the latter.	Cheqaqtapunin chay qhepa kaq karqan.
I know what you did last year	Qayna wata ruwasqaykita yachani
But he wasn’t always drunk	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu machasqa karqan
I don’t know anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu
I didn’t think he would come back	Manam piensarqanichu kutimunanta
You never knew what was going to happen to him.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu paywan imakuna pasananta.
So by doing what he tells you to do.	Chaymi ruwanaykipaq nisqanta ruwaspa.
However, this may not be the right approach for you.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman qanpaq.
I know what they are, after all	Yachanim ima kasqankuta, tukuy imamanta
I knew you were with me every day	Yacharqanim sapa punchaw ñuqawan kasqaykita
I was very curious to see everything.	Anchatam yachayta munarqani tukuy imata qawayta.
That’s what you know.	Chaytan yachanki.
I don’t think anyone would want to	Mana pipas munanmanchu, nispaymi yuyaykuni
Not very good at that.	Mana ancha allinchu chaypi.
He certainly doesn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu ruwan.
I don’t want to wait either.	Ñuqapas manam suyayta munanichu.
I don’t really know what he’s doing.	Mana allintachu yachani ima ruwasqanmanta.
He knows that’s the way it is.	Payqa chaynatam yachan.
I want to think about this	Kaypi yuyaymanayta munani
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqa.
It was the night before.	Ñawpaq tutan karqan.
I heard what happened	Uyarirqanim ima pasasqanmanta
I wanted to know more	Astawan yachayta munarqani
I thought it was him	Pay kasqanmantam piensarqani
Nothing has ever been so simple.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu karqan.
I'm sure it's good	Seguro kani allin kasqanmanta
I was very nice	Ancha sumaqmi karqani
I couldn’t help but notice them	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu chaykunataqa mana repararqanichu
I'm sure there's nothing	Seguro kani mana imapas kasqanmanta
I know what happened.	Yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I think about being alone	Sapallan kaypi yuyaykuni
I know it's great, but who knows what might happen	Yachanim hatun kasqanmanta, ichaqa pi yachan imakuna pasananta
A lot of people were out here tonight.	Achka runakunam kunan tuta kaypi hawapi karqaku.
I couldn’t do it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam atirqanichu.
That has to be me.	Chayqa ñuqam kanan.
I am so sorry for you.	Anchatam llakikuni qammanta.
No, please.	Manan, ama.
I can’t imagine it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I heard about him yesterday	Qayna punchawmi paymanta uyarirqani
This is the big stuff.	Kaymi hatun imakuna.
Everything was bigger here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas aswan hatunmi karqa.
But it was to no avail.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​karqan.
I was the last chance	Ñuqaqa qhipa kaq chansa karqani
An object is unique or not.	Huk imapas sapallanmi icha manachu.
No one would ever want that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munanmanchu.
But it was faster.	Ichaqa aswan utqayllam karqa.
I really want to see it	Anchatam qawayta munani
Isn’t that great?.	¿Manachu chayqa ancha hatun?.
Like most things.	Yaqa llapan imakuna hina.
Unfortunately, this did not work out.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana allinchu karqa.
No, he’s not happy.	Manan, manan kusisqachu.
I am happy so far	Kunankamaqa kusisqam kachkani
We are good people here.	Kaypi allin runakunam kanchik.

I think there are three	Kimsa kasqanmantam piensani
I pretty much know that	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá yachani
I mean, of course.	Niyta munani, sut’inmi.
I think that would be a good thing	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispam piensani
Very, very sad.	Ancha, ancha llakisqa.
I don’t know what it’s like	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa
I want to eat him	Paytaqa mikhuyta munani
This could be you.	Kayqa qanmi kanman.
Now everyone has new ideas.	Kunanqa lliwmi musuq yuyayniyuq kanku.
I like it, to be honest	Gustanmi, chiqap rimanaypaq
I mean great.	Hatun niyta munani.
Someone else will do it.	Huk runam ruwanqa.
Just not sure what that would be.	Chaylla mana segurochu imachus chay kananmanta.
I didn’t know what to do for him	Manam yacharqanichu paypaq imata ruwanayta
And they’re terrified.	Hinaspa mancharisqa kachkanku.
They had some ideas.	Paykunaqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
I'm happy with how it turned out.	Kusisqam kachkani imayna kasqanmanta.
I thought it was really hard	Cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani
I thought you were someone else	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I’m thinking about it.	Chaypin yuyaykushani.
I want to be a little alone	Huk chhikanta sapallay kayta munani
Now tell me what you know.	Kunanqa willaway ima yachasqaykita.
I had to do something to prevent that from happening	Chayna mana kananpaqmi imatapas ruwanay karqa
But I can’t stop him from learning the truth	Ichaqa manan hark’ayta atiymanchu cheqaq kaqta yachananpaq
But it was probably a real rush	Ichaqa yaqapaschá cheqaq usqhaylla ruway karqan
She can’t remember the last time she was this upset.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atinchu qhepa kutipi kay hina llakisqa kashasqanmanta.
How it was there for him.	Imaynatataq paypaq chaypi kasqa.
No, not quite like this.	Manan, manan allintachu kay hinata.
I was hurt and angry.	K’irisqa, phiñasqa ima karqani.
I want to be like that.	Chayna kaytam munani.
I am not a rich man by any means	Manan imapipas qhapaq runachu kani
Second, what is the process.	Iskay kaq, ima ruwaymi.
But he didn’t do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu.
I did something today	Kunan punchawmi imatapas ruwarqani
But it doesn’t work here.	Ichaqa manan kaypiqa allinchu.
I feel so much better	Ancha allinmi sientekuni
He really wanted to be an adult.	Payqa anchatan munarqan kuraq runa kayta.
Like really bad.	Chiqap mana allin hina.
I almost wanted him to	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta munarqani
It was just that.	Chayllaraqmi karqan.
But I was glad he did	Ichaqa kusisqan karqani chayta ruwasqanmanta
I listen to it a lot now	Kunanqa anchatam uyarini
I couldn’t leave it there	Manam chaypi saqiyta atirqanichu
I wonder how it is in practice	Tapukuni imaynataq kachkan ruwaypi
I feel sorry for him	Paymanta llakikuni
That would have been about a year ago now	Chayqa yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi kunanqa kanman karqa
Like a depressed person	Huk llakisqa runa hina
I felt exhausted too	Ñuqapas sayk’usqa hinam tarikurqani
I can't believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu
A girl is with him.	Huk sipasmi paywan kachkan.
That’s how it is to get a good night’s sleep.	Chay hinaqa allin puñuyta ruwaymi.
It wasn't such a big deal.	Manam chayna hatun ruwaychu karqa.
But I don’t know what happened to it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imachus chaywan pasasqanmanta.
I wonder what he thinks that means.	Tapukunitaqmi chaywan ima niyta munasqanmanta piensasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Manam ima mana allin ruwaytapas munarqanichu.
This is what you need to do.	Kaytaqa ruwana.
I couldn’t let this happen though.	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu ichaqa.
But he probably won't.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana chayta ruwanqachu.
You’re right there.	Chaypim kachkanki.
I couldn’t get away with it, really	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atirqanichu, chiqaptapuni
The first one was immediate.	Ñawpaq kaqmi chaylla karqa.
I tried to do something	Imatapas ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
I am well aware that this is a very difficult task.	Allintam yachani kay ruwayqa ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
It was really nice but scary at the same time.	Chiqamanta sumaq karqa ichaqa manchay chay kikin pachapi.
I had everything to myself.	Ñuqaqa tukuy imatam ñuqapaq karqa.
But I still can't hear it	Ichaqa kunankamapas manam uyariyta atiymanchu
No, it’s not true.	Manan, manan cheqaqchu.
Bigger and better.	Aswan hatun hinaspa aswan allin.
Now, tell me.	Kunanqa, willaway.
You want to see everything.	Tukuy imatam qawayta munanki.
Beautiful, beautiful weather	Sumaq, sumaq pacha
He doesn’t care, really.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, cheqaqtapunin.
I didn’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
It doesn’t matter at all	Manam ni imapipas imananpaschu
Together or not.	Kuska utaq mana.
It was great to be there	Chaypi kayqa ancha allinmi karqa
I wish he never did	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas ruwananta
Now, I don’t care about that.	Kunanqa, manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
I've never seen him now	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kunanqa
You don’t know what the future holds.	Manan yachankichu hamuq tiempopi imakuna kananta.
He was supposed to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi kasqa.
You’re either there.	Qamqa icha chaypi kachkanki.
Next year, maybe.	Hamuq wata, ichapas.
I better ask myself	Aswan allinmi tapukuni
The third guy.	Kimsa kaq wayna.
I can't think about it anymore	Manañam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
Not yet, anyway.	Manaraq, imayna kaptinpas.
I certainly do like him	Cheqaqtapunin pay hina ruwani
An injury perhaps.	Huk k’irisqa ichapas.
I was either nervous or excited, or both.	Icha mancharisqa utaq kusisqa karqani, utaq iskayninku.
That was a big deal, still.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi karqan, kunankamapas.
I’ve always been like that	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqani
I didn’t know it would be so overwhelming for you	Manam yacharqanichu chayna llumpayta qampaq kananta
I really like that phrase	Chay rimayqa anchatam gustan
I have a lot of ideas.	Achka yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I want to see what it looks like	Imayna kasqanmantam qawayta munani
I think he would have done that.	Chaytaqa ruwanman karqan nispan yuyaykuni.
I thought something was wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
A nice feature	Huk sumaq ruway
I know you didn't know any better at the time	Yachanim chay tiempopi mana aswan allinta yachasqaykita
I can’t give up.	Manam saqiyta atiymanchu.
But for something else.	Ichaqa huk imapaqpas.
I plan to be at the party	Chay fiestapi kaytam yuyaykuni
And then things got better.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa imapas aswan allin karqa.
I don’t want it to be someone else	Manam munanichu huk runa kananta
I was barely on time.	Yaqapaschá tiempopi karqani.
I wasn't supposed to be happy about it	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu kanay karqa
I knew I had to be there.	Yacharqanim chaypi kanaypaq kasqanmanta.
I don’t want money	Manam qullqita munanichu
I was very lucky	Ancha suerteyoqmi karqani
Soon he can walk again.	Pisi tiempollamantan yapamanta puriyta atin.
I don’t seem to have much time	Manapaschá ancha tiempoy kanchu
We certainly agree.	Cheqaqtapunin acuerdopi kayku.
He is very happy about it.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan chaymanta.
I felt so foolish	Ñuqaqa sinchi mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqani
You are not unreasonable.	Manam mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
I love to sleep you know	Puñuyta anchata munani yachanki
He was a better man than she was.	Payqa paymanta aswan allin runan karqan.
He is a good teacher.	Payqa allin yachachiqmi.
I’m glad to be with you.	Kusikuni qanwan kasqaymanta.
He said he couldn't believe it.	Paymi nirqa mana creeyta atisqanmanta.
I wasn't so sure anymore	Manañam chayna segurochu karqani
I never want to stop watching him	Manam haykapipas payta qawayta saqiyta munanichu
It had been half time for a long time.	Unayñan kuskan tiempo karqan.
He thought quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan yuyaykurqan.
That would be the worst.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
I wasn’t sure who that person was	Manam segurochu karqani chay runa pi kasqanmantaqa
But there is another possibility.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi kanman.
The man was a great man.	Chay runaqa hatunmi kasqa.
But I can’t seem to find it again	Ichaqa manañan hukmanta tariyta atiymanchu hina
To your school.	Yachay wasiykiman.
I didn’t want to answer him	Manam paytaqa kutichiyta munarqanichu
Everything is so quick and easy.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqaylla hinaspa mana sasachu.
I just couldn’t eat it.	Chaylla mana mikhuyta atirqanichu.
I knew all about it	Chaytaqa tukuy imatam yacharqani
I will not do that here.	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwasaqchu.
That's right here.	Chayqa kaypim kachkan.
I didn’t know where to go from there.	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta mayman riyta.
I’m cold, he says.	Chiri kani, nispas nin.
Everyone knows something is wrong.	Lliwmi yachanku imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I need to do some things	Wakin ruwaykunata ruwanay tiyan
He loves to talk.	Rimayta anchata munan.
I don't see that there is a problem	Manam rikunichu huk sasachakuy kasqanmanta
I should be there for now	Kunankamaqa chaypim kanay
Tell me how it feels.	Willaway imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I can be like that	Chayna kayta atiyman
Why he would do that is beyond me either.	Imaraykun chayta ruwanman chaytaqa ñoqapas manan yachanichu.
I don’t know why.	Mana yachanichu imarayku.
If so, great.	Chayna kaptinqa, hatunmi.
He asked me everything.	Tukuy imatam tapuwarqa.
He went out, he went out.	Payqa lluqsirqa, lluqsirqa.
That nothing would happen.	Mana imapas pasananta.
I think that's his name	Chayqa sutinmi nispaymi piensani
I knew what was involved	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta
But it had to be him.	Ichaqa paymi kanan karqan.
I hear them every night	Chaykunataqa sapa tutam uyarini
I didn’t really think about that	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani
I wonder why that is.	Chaymi tapukuni imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
I mean, you want to tell someone	Niyta munani, pimanpas willayta munanki
I should have done it more often	Aswan sapa kutim ruwanay karqa
It went well, apparently.	Allintam rirqa, yaqapaschá.
Someone who speaks.	Pipas rimaq.
This is a very good first step.	Kayqa ancha allin ñawpaq ruwaymi.
He did it right	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqa
I know you are right	Yachanim allin kasqaykita
I think it should be me	Yuyaykuni ñuqa kananmanta
You are the person who is always never there.	Qamqa kanki sapa kuti mana haykapipas chaypi kaq runa.
I wish it wasn't	Munaymanmi mana chayna kaptinqa
He gave me a cigarette.	Huk cigarrota quwarqa.
Is it right or wrong.	¿Allinchu icha manachu.
Nothing worse than this.	Mana imapas kaymanta aswan mana allinqa.
I didn’t know what was wrong	Manam yacharqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
He couldn’t stand it.	Manam aguantayta atirqachu.
I’m very tired and overwhelmed	Ancha sayk’usqa, llumpay llakisqa ima kachkani
I should have done that a long time ago.	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwanay karqan.
He told her not to say anything about what happened.	Chaymi nirqa ima pasasqanmanta ama imatapas rimananpaq.
No one cares about it.	Manan pipas imananpaschu.
I think you can go now	Yuyaykuni kunan riyta atisqaykita
I can't talk about it now	Kunanqa manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
I can’t really figure it out	Manam chiqaptachu yuyaymanayta atiyman
I did everything alone	Sapallanmi tukuy imatapas ruwarqani
Really really sick.	Chiqap chiqap unqusqa.
But I didn’t want to rush into it	Ichaqa manan chayman hina usqhaylla ruwayta munarqanichu
But he could never say that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta niyta atirqanchu.
I just can’t stand it	Chaylla mana aguantayta atinichu
I never knew what it was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
I heard if there was anyone outside	Uyarirqanim hawapi pipas kaptinqa
I always have more to do.	Sapa kutim aswan achka ruwanay kan.
I said it didn’t matter	Manam imananpaschu nispaymi nirqani
Seriously, there’s nothing to do.	Serio, manan imapas ruwanapaq kanchu.
He couldn't bear to look at her.	Payqa manam aguantayta atirqachu qawayta.
He was the one who was.	Payqa paymi karqan.
And we are sick of it.	Hinaspa chaymanta unqusqa kanchik.
Now, a child.	Kunanqa, huk wawa.
Usually a year.	Yaqa llapanpim huk wata.
Then I learned about it.	Chaymantam yacharqani.
The previous evening.	Ñawpaq chisi.
I know that sounds crazy	Yachanim chayqa loco hina uyarikun
I hope it was good	Suyachkani allin kasqanmanta
He knew how the child felt.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay wawa imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I was the first to do that	Ñuqam chaytaqa puntata ruwarqani
I know you can do the job	Yachanim chay llamkayta ruwayta atisqaykita
That could have been anything.	Chayqa imapas kanman karqa.
The action is beautiful.	Ruwayqa sumaqmi.
I want someone to know	Pipas yachananta munani
People want to know what it’s like.	Runakunaqa yachayta munanku ima imayna kasqanmanta.
I couldn't believe how fast they were	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna utqaylla kasqankuta
And hid it from him.	Hinaspa pakasqa paymanta.
I don't know if this thing exists.	Mana yachanichu kay imapas kanchu icha manachu.
But it’s not really like that.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna.
And this is difficult.	Hinaspa kayqa sasa.
I knew he needed help	Yacharqanim yanapayta necesitasqanmanta
That was not true	Chay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu karqan
If so, you might want to.	Chayna kaptinqa ichapas munanki.
That wasn’t quite the case.	Chayqa manan allintachu karqan.
Tonight morning, then tonight.	Kunan tuta paqarin, chaymanta kunan tuta.
I couldn’t stand it anymore	Manañam chaytaqa aguantayta atirqanichu
Everyone is everyone.	Tukuy runa tukuy runa.
I couldn’t figure out who he was	Manam pi kasqanmanta yachayta atirqanichu
I had no idea what it was about	Manam piensarqanichu imamanta chayna kasqanmantaqa
I was always along for the ride	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim kuska karqani chay carropi rinaypaq
I was pretty good there	Chaypiqa allin allinmi karqani
It wasn’t very good.	Mana ancha allinchu karqa.
No, two things.	Manan, iskay imakuna.
So, here it is.	Chaymi, kaypi kachkan.
Do it once and for all.	Huk kutilla ruway.
I don't think that's worth it.	Chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​nispan yuyaykuni.
A sequential shape	Huk qatiqnin rikchayniyuq
I was here the first night	Ñawpaq tutan kaypi karqani
I want to hear more about this	Kaymanta astawan uyariyta munani
Nothing can do it.	Manan imapas atinchu.
I doubt that is the case	Iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta
So he’d be happy, at least.	Chaymi payqa kusisqa kanman, aswanpas.
It wasn’t really like that.	Manan cheqaqtachu chhayna karqan.
I don’t understand that	Chaytaqa manam entiendenichu
That’s this fact.	Chayqa kay chiqap kaqmi.
A good good player.	Allin allin pukllaq.
I thought he knew what you were doing.	Yuyarqanim ruwasqaykita yachasqanmanta.
But he acts quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwan.
Almost no one does.	Yaqa mana pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
It was a good night.	Huk tutaqa allinmi karqa.
But you never really know.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu yachanki.
I can't believe you made it all the way here	Manam creeyta atiymanchu kaypi tukuy ñanta ruwasqaykita
A child, he said	Huk wawa, chaytam nirqa
Well? 	Allin?
One by one, you said.	Hukmanta hukmanta, nirqanki.
I have a way to do this	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa imaynatachus ruwanay tiyan
If you don’t want to.	Mana munaspaqa.
I didn’t mean it, but it just happened	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu, ichaqa chaylla pasarqa
I wasn’t sure of anything	Manam imamantapas segurochu karqani
I never noticed that before	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa repararqanichu
He wants it to be good.	Payqa munanmi allin kananta.
He won’t do it.	Manam ruwanqachu.
I thought that was the right thing to do	Chay ruwayqa allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
If you don’t want to, then don’t.	Mana munaspaqa, chaymanta ama.
But he knew that wouldn't happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chay pasananta.
I think he gets lonely in a lonely house	Yuyaykuni sapallan wasipi sapallan tarikun
I’m sure that time will pass quickly	Seguro kani chay tiempo usqhaylla pasananta
The people are beautiful.	Runakunaqa sumaqmi.
Really, I loved it	Chiqaptam, anchatam munarqani
This could mean two things.	Kayqa iskay ruwaykunata niyta atinman.
A really bad night.	Chiqap mana allin tuta.
I feel really bad about that	Chaymantaqa anchatam mana allintachu sientekuni
Actually, it’s fine.	Chiqaptaqa, allinmi.
I don't want to talk now.	Manam kunanqa rimayta munanichu.
I was nervous all day	Tukuy punchawmi mancharisqa tarikurqani
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta.
I haven’t seen anything like it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaynataqa rikurqanichu
I can’t really say	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu
I saw that immediately	Chaytaqa chayllam rikurqani
No, he says, 'It's not.	Manan, nispas nin.
I couldn’t believe it was really mine	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqaptapuni ñuqapa kasqanmanta
More than a little bit.	Aswan huk chikan.
You know it doesn't.	Yachankim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He said that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispam nirqa.
It would be a good idea to do so.	Chayta ruwaspaqa allinmi kanman.
It’s been here for a long time.	Unayñam kaypi kachkan.
I still think about that	Chaypim kunankamapas piensani
But you are the first.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki ñawpaq kaq.
He wanted to speak quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan rimayta munarqan.
I mean, he didn’t think about it	Niyta munani, payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu
That’s better than nothing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
I have no idea what this could be	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imataq kay kanman
I couldn’t speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
He truly wants the best for you.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munan qanpaq allin kaqta.
I didn’t see much of the action	Manam anchatachu rikurqani chay ruwaytaqa
I don’t want to be alone again	Manan hukmanta sapallay kayta munanichu
I know it is true	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta
These were really really good.	Kaykunaqa chiqap chiqap allinmi karqa.
So now you are.	Chaymi kunanqa kanki.
But it’s not really a secret at all.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu pakasqa kashan ni imapipas.
I didn’t really know what it was at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan allintachu yacharqani imachus kasqanmanta
I wasn’t supposed to be there	Manam chaypichu kanay karqa
He began to tell her who he was and what he did.	Payqa pi kasqanmanta, ima ruwasqanmanta niyta qallaykurqa.
I didn’t expect that.	Manam suyarqanichu chay.
No, he doesn’t know her name.	Manan, payqa manan sutinta yachanchu.
I never knew how to drive	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imayna manejayta
I strongly disagree	Sinchitan mana acuerdopichu kani
I had to make sure it was okay	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kanay karqa
He was everything.	Payqa tukuy imapas karqa.
I mean never.	Mana hayk’aqpas niyta munani.
I can't do it, he says.	Manam atiymanchu, nispas nin.
I wish I could have.	Munaymanmi karqa.
I am very much looking forward to it happening.	Anchatam suyachkani pasananta.
So that’s the biggest thing.	Chaymi chaymi aswan hatun kaq.
I haven’t gone swimming with it yet.	Manaraqmi chaywanqa nadaq rirqanichu.
I think about that a lot	Chaytaqa anchatam piensani
Don’t be like me.	Ama ñuqa hina kaychu.
I know they are here	Yachanim kaypi kasqankuta
I know very well how good you are.	Ancha allintam yachani imayna allin kasqaykita.
I was proud of it	Chaywanmi orgulloso karqani
No, or anything like that.	Manan, nitaq imapas chay hinachu.
The truth is a truth.	Cheqaq kaqmi huk cheqaq kaq.
I know there will be a lot of people	Yachanim achka runakuna kananta
I just had no idea how beautiful it was	Chaylla mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani imayna sumaq kasqanmanta
I can’t do this anymore	Manañam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I thought the same thing	Ñuqapas chaynatam piensarqani
Two months ago at least.	Iskay killa ñawpaqtaraqmi aswanpas.
I never realized how good he looked	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu imayna allin rikchayniyuq kasqanmantaqa
Have a nice day.	Sumaq punchaw.
No one else did that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Who knew how long.	Pitaq yacharqa hayka unayta.
It’s the way the world is going to be.	Kay pacha imayna kananpaqmi.
I know what you mean	Yachanim ima niyta munasqaykita
I wasn’t sure what was going to happen	Manam segurochu karqani imapas kananmanta
I really can’t imagine	Chiqaptaqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
The night before.	Ñawpaq tuta.
That statement seemed very strange.	Chay rimayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
I didn’t want that to happen	Manam munarqanichu chayna kananta
He didn’t want to be friends with her.	Payqa manan paywan amigontin kayta munarqanchu.
I think you did a great job	Yuyaykuni ancha hatun llamkayta ruwasqaykita
The reality was different.	Chay cheqaq kaqmi huk hina karqan.
The easier it is, the better.	Aswan facil kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Strong and young.	Sinchi hinaspa wayna.
I had a pretty good idea who he was	Ñuqaqa allin allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani pi kasqanmanta
Then three, then two.	Chaymanta kimsa, chaymanta iskay.
I never want to do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaytaqa munanichu
I do that every morning	Chaytaqa sapa paqarinmi ruwani
I didn’t want him to get hurt	Manam munarqanichu k’irisqa kasqanta
I knew he was disappointed	Yacharqanim hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
That was about a year ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
That’s what happened.	Chayqa pasarqa.
We can’t do it anymore.	Manañam atichwanchu.
I can’t imagine what it’s like now.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu kunan imayna kasqanmanta.
He probably didn’t do that.	Manapaschá chaytachu ruwarqan.
I just wasn’t sure it was safe here	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani kaypi segurochu kasqanmanta
I have to do it.	Ñuqaqa ruwanay tiyan.
I am very sad and worried	Ancha llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkani
More that same morning.	Aswan chay kikin paqarin.
No one knows what he looks like.	Imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmantaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
I really want to do the right thing	Cheqaqtapunin munani allin kaqta ruwayta
No, it’s not too good to be true.	Manan, manan ancha allinchu cheqaq kananpaq.
Faster than you.	Qammanta aswan utqaylla.
Yes, he did.	Arí, chaytam ruwarqa.
Many thanks again.	Yapamanta achka gracias.
I can’t do that anymore	Manañan chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
Why, he couldn't say.	Imarayku, mana niyta atirqachu.
I still think this is the best	Kunankamapas kayqa aswan allin kananpaqmi piensani
I haven’t found it yet	Manaraqmi tarinichu
I was surprised by that	Chaywanmi admirakurqani
I am sick and worried about him.	Paymanta unqusqa llakisqa kachkani.
I’m more afraid of what he’s doing	Aswan manchakuni ima ruwasqanmanta
What it doesn’t mean.	Imatachus mana niyta munanchu chayta.
He says he doesn’t know.	Mana yachanichu nin.
He sounds kind of funny.	Payqa huk laya asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
They are not there yet.	Paykunaqa manaraqmi chaypichu kachkanku.
No one knew what that meant.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu chay ima niyta munasqanmanta.

That it is a new world.	Musuq pacha kasqanmanta.
Usually, very early in the morning.	Yaqa llapanpim, ancha tutamanta.
He is a rich man.	Payqa qhapaq runam.
It shouldn’t be this hard.	Manan kay hina sasachu kanan.
I really can't answer that	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa kutichiyta atiymanchu
He looked at her sternly.	Payqa sinchitan qhawarisqa.
I really wonder how true it is.	Chiqaptam tapukuni imayna chiqap kasqanmanta.
And in the hospital.	Hinaspa hospitalpi.
I've never seen that before	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu
I want to play with him	Paywan pukllayta munani
I didn’t know it was that bad	Manam yacharqanichu chayna millay kasqanmanta
I’ll do the leaving.	Saqiyta ruwasaq.
I never wanted to be good	Manam haykapipas allin kaytaqa munarqanichu
But tomorrow is another day.	Ichaqa paqarinmi huk punchaw.
Yeah, this is just me.	Arí, kayqa ñuqallam.
I kind of don’t.	Ñuqaqa huk laya mana.
They’re tired, depressed, and sick.	Sayk’usqa, llakisqa, unqusqa ima kanku.
And then it doesn’t.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana.
Whatever you want.	Imapas munasqaykita.
I can’t wait to go	Manam suyayta atinichu rinaypaq
He really, really said that.	Payqa chiqaptam, chiqaptam chayta nirqa.
Or that it should be.	Utaq chayna kananmanta.
Very, very wrong.	Ancha, ancha pantasqa.
But he knew his true nature.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi cheqaq imayna kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t tell anyone	Manam pimanpas willayta atirqanichu
I wanted to know it all, I wanted to understand it all	Tukuy chayta yachayta munarqani, tukuyta entiendeyta munarqani
No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I didn’t want to know who he was	Manam pi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqanichu
I can’t remember where though	Manam yuyariyta atinichu maypi ichaqa
This shouldn't be too difficult.	Kayqa manam ancha sasachu kanan.
I did as he did.	Pay hinam ruwarqani.
I really need to do some work	Chiqamanta wakin llamk’ayta ruwanay tiyan
Often, you are.	Sapa kutim, qamqa kanki.
I want you to be here with me	Kaypi ñuqawan kanaykita munani
I would be a celebrity.	Ñuqaqa riqsisqa runa kayman.
Not sure what happened there.	Mana segurochu chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I thought it was anyway	Imayna kaptinpas chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I know what will happen to him	Yachanim paymanta imakuna kananta
Please forgive me.	Ama hina kaspa pampachaykuway.
But I doubt it is	Ichaqa iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to do it again	Manam hukmanta ruwayta munarqanichu
I was always doing strange and silly things	Sapa kutim mana riqsisqa hinaspa mana yuyayniyuq ruwaykunata ruwaq kani
I have a day too	Ñoqapas huk p’unchaymi kan
Now that's the worst part.	Kunanqa chaymi aswan mana allinqa.
Maybe it was too fast.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla karqa.
I was in the hospital for three days	Kimsa punchawmi hospitalpi karqani
He said that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa nispam nirqa.
I want to get there	Chayman chayayta munani
But I’m not sure	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani
He didn’t think about it.	Payqa manan chaypichu yuyaykurqan.
Say it now.	Kunan niy.
They are both of them.	Iskayninkum kanku.
I still want to do a book about you.	Kunankamapas qanmanta librota ruwayta munani.
I said that was wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam nirqani.
Now this sounds really interesting.	Kunanqa kayqa chiqaptam sumaq uyarikun.
Great is a good one.	Hatunmi allin.
He isn’t real.	Payqa manan cheqaqchu.
I just wanted to leave here	Chaylla kaymanta ripuyta munarqani
I never want to do that.	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwaytaqa munanichu.
This is completely wrong.	Kayqa tukuy imamanta pantasqa kachkan.
Again he wanted to know why.	Yapamanta yachayta munarqa imanasqa chayta.
But okay, okay.	Ichaqa allinmi, allinmi.
I actually thought it was great.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I still want to fix it	Chaytaqa hinallam allichayta munani
I know what he would want	Yachanim imatachus munanman chayta
I knew something seemed very good	Yacharqanim imapas ancha allin hina kasqanmanta
I knew there was more	Yacharqanim aswan achka kasqanmanta
I knew there was something	Yacharqanim imapas kasqanmanta
Again, no big deal.	Yapamanta, mana hatun ruwaychu.
I never knew why that was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I knew where it would be	Yacharqanim maypi kananta
Go to another country.	Huk nacionman riy.
I feel better about myself	Aswan allintam tarikuni
Can you handle that for me ?.	¿Atiwaqchu chayta ñuqapaq manejayta ?.
I don’t have a sense of humor.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani.
So far I am not happy.	Kunankamaqa manam kusisqachu kachkani.
I want more than this	Kaymantaqa aswan achkatam munani
He was badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa kasharqan.
Do that process for a while.	Chay ruwayta huk rato ruway.
I'm sure everything will be fine	Seguro kani tukuy imapas allin kananta
I didn’t want to know anything else	Manam hukta yachayta munarqanichu
This is what happened here.	Kaymi kaypi pasarqa.
He was in serious trouble.	Payqa hatun sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Otherwise, next time.	Mana chayqa, qhipa kutipi.
To that.	Chayman.
I didn't want to think about this anymore	Manañam kaypiqa yuyaymanayta munarqanichu
I can do that later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi ruwayman.
Good night, guys.	Allin tuta.
I know there's a lot of stuff, okay	Yachanim imapas achka kasqanmanta, allinmi
I am so excited to give it a try.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani huk kutita ruwanaypaq.
Cold day.	Chiri punchaw.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus kananta.
I still wanted it too much	Hinallam llumpayta munarqani
Today he was who I was.	Kunan punchawmi pay pipas ñuqa karqani.
I'll go in the car.	Ñoqaqa carropi risaq.
I couldn’t get over it	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atirqanichu
I didn’t think he would come back	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kutimunanta
I went to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi rirqani
He didn’t want to catch her.	Payqa manan hap’iyta munarqanchu.
I want the best for you	Aswan allintam munani qampaq
New people every night, every week, and so on.	Musuq runakuna sapa tuta, sapa semana, chaymanta chaymanta.
Okay folks, we're really here.	Allinmi runakuna, chiqaptam kaypi kachkaniku.
I was a human being.	Huk runam karqani.
What a terrible day.	Ima manchay punchawmi.
I would do the same for you	Chaynatam qampaq ruwayman karqa
Never at all.	Mana hayk’aqpas ni imapipas.
I do a lot of those things.	Chaykunataqa achkatam ruwani.
I didn’t know who he was	Manam yacharqanichu pi kasqanmanta
You may have to do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanayki kanqa.
I can’t do everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas ruwaymanchu.
I wanted to be yours	Ñoqaqa qanpa kaytan munarqani
She was so beautiful, beautiful.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa, sumaqmi karqa.
I certainly used to be like that	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaqtaqa chhayna karqani
I still can't figure out what it was	Kunankamapas manam yuyaymanayta atinichu ima kasqanmanta
That should be there.	Chayqa chaypi kanan tiyan.
He felt happy, overjoyed.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa, llumpay kusisqa.
I was still unsure of what had just happened.	Hinallam mana allintachu yacharqani imakuna chayllaraq pasasqanmanta.
I think people are people.	Yuyaykuni runakunaqa runakuna kasqankuta.
Okay, no big deal.	Allinmi, manam hatun ruwaychu.
He couldn’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atirqachu.
But yeah, he's probably there.	Ichaqa arí, payqa yaqapaschá chaypi kashan.
I mean that in a better way	Chaytaqa aswan allinta niyta munani
He didn’t want this man to be with him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kay runa paywan kuska kananta.
I have a lot of work to do about it	Chaypaqqa anchatam ruwanay kachkan
I didn't think it would happen	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta
And he wanted to help.	Hinaspa yanapayta munarqa.
I know you want someone to do everything right	Yachanim pipas tukuy imata allinta ruwananta munasqaykita
I really wanted to stay with him	Cheqaqtapunin paywan qhepakuyta munarqani
I didn’t really want that.	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa munarqani.
It’s not about food safety.	Manan mikhuy allin kananpaqchu.
If you are, know this.	Chay hina kanki chayqa, kayta yachay.
He didn’t do it right	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan
I think they’re both gone.	Iskayninku manaña kasqankuta yuyani.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runakunam.
I didn’t want to be like that	Manam chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu
I don’t intend to go	Manam rinaypaq yuyaykunichu
We agree that this is not the case.	Mana chayna kasqanmantam acuerdopi kayku.
I hope you will	Suyachkani chaynata ruwanaykipaq
I know what it’s like	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta
He wasn't sure how he felt.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I couldn't really say why	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
That’s what we did.	Chaynatam ruwarqayku.
The other one is me.	Huknin ñuqa.
And the other one.	Hinaspa huknin kaq.
He was the best in every way.	Payqa tukuy imapipas aswan allinmi karqa.
And he looked angry.	Hinaspa payqa phiñasqa qhawarisqa.
But today it didn't matter.	Ichaqa kunan punchawqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
I thought it would be gone for like a year.	Yuyarqanim huk wata hina manaña kananta.
I want it very badly.	Ancha mana allintam munani.
He’s, like.	Payqa, hina.
They were quick but not slow.	Paykunaqa usqhayllan karqanku ichaqa manan usqhayllachu karqanku.
I’m not really sure about that.	Manam chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I know you are not to blame for what happened that day	Yachanim chay punchaw pasasqanmantaqa mana huchayoq kasqaykita
I want you to make sure he’s happy	Munani kusisqa kananpaq seguro kanaykita
But it would have been nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanman karqan.
A bad day was anything	Mana allin punchawqa imapas karqa
I really can't stop him now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa mana hark'ayta atiymanchu.
It didn’t seem difficult.	Manam sasachu rikchakurqa.
I was ready to do it	Chaytaqa ruwanaypaqmi listo karqani
He didn’t notice anything.	Payqa manan imatapas repararqanchu.
I can't let that happen anymore	Manañam chay pasananta saqiyta atiymanchu
I could never get out of here	Manam haykapipas kaymanta lluqsiyta atirqanichu
I know how bad you want to be	Yachanim imayna mana allinta kayta munasqaykita
I don't know exactly where it is	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmanta
I haven’t seen him in a long time	Unayñan mana paytaqa rikurqanichu
I want to hear about everything	Tukuy imamanta uyariyta munani
I have a lot to tell you	Achkatam willanaypaq kachkan
He didn’t want to know, but he knew.	Payqa manan yachayta munarqanchu, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
It never, you know, still exists	Manam haykapipas, yachanki, kunankamapas kanchu
I think quickly.	Yuyaykuni utqaylla.
I think he wanted to talk to me	Yuyaykuni ñuqawan rimayta munasqanmanta
I really wanted it right now	Anchatan munarqani kunanpacha
I may not have said it right.	Manapaschá allintachu nirqani.
He wanted this man arrested.	Payqa kay runa hap’isqa kananta munarqa.
But there was one day for me	Ichaqa huk punchawmi ñuqapaq karqa
I didn’t want to be like that anymore.	Manañam chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu.
He felt comfortable here.	Payqa kaypiqa allintam tarikurqa.
They were the ones.	Paykunaqa karqanku.
That seemed a little too good to be true.	Chayqa huk chikan ancha allinmi rikchakurqa chiqap kananpaq.
He said it was mine.	Payqa ñuqapa kasqanmantam nirqa.
There he goes again.	Chaypim yapamanta rin.
I didn't know what to do either.	Ñoqapas manan yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta, nispa.
I didn’t expect so much	Manam suyarqanichu chayna achkata
I know where he lives	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta
He's very proud of it.	Payqa anchatam chaymanta orgulloso.
A wicked man.	Huk millay runa.
But he made an effort.	Ichaqa kallpachakurqanmi.
I don’t like rudeness	Manam gustanchu mana allin rimayqa
I knew a new teacher was coming but you	Yacharqanim huk musuq yachachiq hamunanta ichaqa qam
That’s not even.	Chay nitaq.
There are many, really.	Achka kanku, chiqap.
You seem safe.	Seguro hinam kanki.
He was, perhaps, ten.	Payqa, ichapas, chunka karqan.
This is no longer a good thing.	Kayqa manañam allinchu.
I couldn’t be with anyone	Manam piwanpas kayta atirqanichu
For now, he is.	Kunankamaqa payqa.
Very good people.	Ancha allin runakuna.
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Kunan, paqarin, hamuq semana.
I don’t think that’s it.	Manam yuyanichu chaytaqa.
He looked good tonight.	Payqa kunan tutan allinta qhawarisqa.
But he is not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan.
Faster than that.	Chaymanta aswan utqaylla.
I didn’t notice it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa repararqanichu
And this is important here.	Hinaspa kayqa kaypiqa ancha allinmi.
How are they going to be.	Imaynataq paykunaqa.
A day or a week is fine, depending.	Huk punchaw utaq huk semana allinmi, chayman hina.
I'm not so sure about this	Manam chayna segurochu kani kaymanta
I never really thought of it that way	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaynataqa piensarqanichu
It was crazy.	Loco hinam karqa.
I may have to do it again	Yaqapaschá hukmanta ruwanay kanqa
I did what needed to be done.	Imatachus ruwana kaqta ruwarqani.
I could never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I have always thought about it	Sapa kutim chaypi piensarqani
But you have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintam ruwanayki.
So thank you.	Chaymi gracias.
In fact, it’s probably not worth it.	Chiqaptaqa, manapaschá chayna valenchu.
I didn’t really know what was going to happen	Manam allintachu yacharqani imakuna kananmanta
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
He said it was true.	Cheqaqtapunin nirqan.
I don’t want to go anywhere.	Manam maymanpas riyta munanichu.
It sounds better.	Aswan allinmi uyarikun.
This is just that.	Kayqa chaylla.
He was a very intelligent man.	Payqa ancha yachaysapa runam karqa.
That’s been a long time.	Chayqa unayñam.
Being the best at something.	Imapipas aswan allin kay.
I’m a pity	Llakikuypaqmi kani
It’s the truth.	Cheqaq kaqmi.
He, not so sure.	Pay, mana chayna segurochu.
So far, it has never worked out.	Kunankamaqa manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
I mean, then it just happened	Niyta munani, chaymanta chaylla pasarqa
I know something is wrong now	Yachanim kunan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
That sounds tough.	Chayqa sinchitan uyarikun.
I didn’t know he was in this city.	Manam yacharqanichu kay llaqtapi kasqanmanta.
I know you did your best	Yachanim tukuy atisqaykita ruwasqaykita
I'm very proud of it.	Anchatam orgulloso kani chaymanta.
A summer day can be beautiful	Verano punchawqa sumaqmi kanman
I don't know where he is here	Manam yachanichu maypi kaypi kasqanmanta
It was certainly the worst.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan mana allinqa karqan.
If it’s that good.	Chayna allin kaptinqa.
She really wanted to believe him.	Payqa anchatan payta creeyta munarqan.
I hope to find the right one, one day	Suyachkani allin kaqta tariyta, huk punchaw
I didn’t expect him to	Manam suyarqanichu chayta ruwananta
The moment passed.	Chay rato pasarqa.
I wanted to be happy	Kusisqa kaytam munarqani
That way it was better.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi karqan.
But it’s so wrong, so terribly wrong.	Ichaqa ancha pantasqa, ancha manchay pantasqa.
Twice too many.	Iskay kuti llumpay achka.
Pretty much everything, actually.	Yaqa tukuy ima, chiqaptaqa.
I never knew about this.	Manam haykapipas kaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
I thought that was wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I really thought something was wrong	Chiqaptam imapas mana allin kasqanmanta piensarqani
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasananta
I had no idea how it would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna pasananta
I didn’t want to study	Manam estudiayta munarqanichu
I knew he couldn't do much	Yacharqanim mana ancha ruway atisqanmanta
You don’t want to help.	Manam yanapayta munankichu.
This should take about a week but probably no longer.	Kayqa yaqa huk semana hinam kanan ichaqa manapaschá aswan unaytachu.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Yacharqanim imanasqa kasqanmanta, ichaqa manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
And then two.	Hinaspa chaymanta iskay.
Yes, I am the one.	Arí, ñuqam kani.
There was a house today.	Kunan punchawmi huk wasi karqa.
He said everything about me was so great.	Payqa nirqam tukuy ima ñuqamanta ancha hatun kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t do that	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu
I just thought you were	Chayllaraqmi piensarqani chayna kasqaykita
I don't want to believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu
It’s all here.	Tukuy kaypi kachkan.
I just didn’t know why	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imarayku chayta
I don’t really mean anything.	Mana allintachu ima niyta munani.
But he had to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I do this, every day	Kayta ruwani, sapa p’unchaw
Now this is where things get a little tricky.	Kunanqa kaypim imapas huk chikan sasachakuypi tarikun.
The darker the better.	Aswan yana kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
They were all good.	Llapallankum allin karqaku.
There was someone here.	Kaypiqa pipas kasqa.
I can’t be like that	Manam chayna kayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t understand them either	Ñoqapas manan chaykunataqa entiendeyta atirqanichu
The process was just that, a process.	Chay ruwayqa chaylla karqan, huk ruwaymi.
I didn’t make much of it	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa ruwarqani
And everything was really great.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas chiqaptapuni hatun karqa.
I can’t fix anything	Manam imatapas allichayta atiymanchu
I don’t know what that is, what it could have been.	Mana yachanichu imachus chay kasqanmanta, imachus kanman karqan chayta.
I haven't seen him in about a year	Yaqa huk watañam mana paytaqa rikunichu
Here it was, it was.	Kaypim karqa.
He had been there for a long time.	Unayñam chaypi karqa.
There was a lot to do.	Achkatam ruwana karqa.
I am not a reasonable person.	Manam yuyayniyuq runachu kani.
But one good thing.	Ichaqa huk allin kaq.
I can’t listen to that now	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa uyariyta atiymanchu
It’s a nice cold one.	Sumaq chiri kaq.
Indeed, it is.	Cheqaqtapuni.
You, baby.	Qam, wawa.
I don't believe it is.	Manam creenichu chayna kasqanmanta.
So it’s not a human being.	Chaymi mana runachu.
Okay, maybe one or two.	Allinmi, ichapas huk utaq iskay.
That’s all this guy is.	Chayllam kay runaqa.
First, I want to see what's in it	Ñawpaqtaqa imakuna chaypi kasqanmantam qawayta munani
I want to help with that	Chaypi yanapayta munani
I feel strongly about this	Kaymantaqa sinchitan sientekuni
I almost couldn’t do it	Yaqapaschá mana ruwayta atirqanichu
I want to think about it carefully	Allintam chaypi yuyaymanayta munani
It was like something.	Imapas hinam karqa.
If the process fails, I try to try something else.	Sichus chay ruway mana allintachu ruwan chayqa, huk ruwayta ruwayta munani.
But I knew what we had to do	Ichaqa yacharqanim ima ruwanayku kasqanmanta
I have no idea why that is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku chayna kasqanmanta
I thought it was good	Allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
Can’t stand it.	Mana chayta aguantayta atinchu.
I desperately wanted to say no	Sinchitan mana niyta munarqani
Not sure here.	Mana segurochu kaypi.
I have no idea where it is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi kasqanmanta
He says it’s great.	Payqa ancha allinmi nin.
As he says something.	Imatapas nisqanman hina.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Payqa allintan yacharqan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I was happy with that	Chaywanmi kusisqa tarikurqani
I want to know this	Kay yachayta munani
I haven’t heard anything in a long time	Unayñan mana imatapas uyarirqanichu
Really happy for him.	Chiqamanta kusisqa paypaq.
And that’s what he meant.	Hinaspa chaymi niyta munarqa.
Bad day, guys.	Mana allin punchaw.
I didn’t want to be with anyone all day	Manam tukuy punchawchu piwan kuska kayta munarqani
Then a new person.	Chaymanta musuq runa.
That’s why it takes so long.	Chayraykum ancha unayta.
A nice feature.	Huk sumaq ruway.
I would love to see a movie	Anchatam munani huk peliculata qawayta
I really want to talk to you	Anchatam qamwan rimayta munani
And he wanted to do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwayta munarqa.
I had to do it yesterday	Qayna punchawmi ruwanay karqa
It was never easy.	Manam haykapipas facilchu karqa.
So it was quick.	Chaymi utqaylla karqa.
I’ve seen it all before	Tukuy chaykunataqa ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani
There was no real action.	Manam chiqap ruwayqa karqachu.
I won’t be able to sleep	Manam puñuyta atisaqchu
We are still here.	Hinallam kaypi kachkaniku.
Second and more important.	Iskay kaq hinaspa aswan importante kaq.
I feel uncomfortable with that now	Chaywanmi kunanqa mana allintachu sientekuni
And if you do it this way, it’s not that hard.	Hinaspa kay hinata ruwanki chayqa, manan chay hina sasachu.
And then he did.	Hinaspa chaymanta ruwarqa.
I just really like it.	Chaylla anchata gustan.
He really didn’t know.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana yacharqanchu.
These will continue.	Chaykunataqa hinallam kanqa.
I felt very happy	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani
He told me to do it.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi nirqa.
But this is very interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
You know that’s what you know.	Chayta yachanki.
This was the reality.	Kaymi karqan cheqaq kaq.
He couldn't speak, but he didn't need to.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu, ichaqa manan necesitarqanchu.
On the contrary, it is worse.	Aswanpas aswan mana allinmi.
I know that, he knows that.	Chaytaqa yachanim, payqa chaytam yachan.
I can’t stay mad at him for long	Manam unaytachu paywan phiñasqa kayta atiyman
I don’t think so.	Manam piensanichu.
I was so uncomfortable	Ñuqaqa chayna mana allinchu karqani
You want to know more about one.	Hukmanta astawan yachayta munanki.
I will never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
I thought it was, at least.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani, aswanpas.
I can do that quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwayta atiyman.
But that he needed more sleep.	Ichaqa aswan puñuyta necesitasqanmanta.
I thought it was great.	Ancha allinmi nispan yuyaykurqani.
I think he was right.	Payqa allintan rimarqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
This is the week.	Kaymi semana.
Not yet anyway.	Manaraqmi imayna kaptinpas.
Then things got really good.	Chaymantaqa imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
I am not like a human being.	Manam runa hinachu kani.
He really wanted to believe it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin creeyta munarqan.
I can’t deal with that	Manam chaywanqa atipayta atiymanchu
You were there last night.	Qayna tutan chaypi karqanki.
You were in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa karqanki.
The third is as a married man.	Kimsa kaqmi casarasqa runa hina.
I think something else will happen	Yuyaykuni huk imapas pasananta
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don't feel so good right now	Kunanqa manam ancha allinchu tarikuni
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Pampachaykuway nispa.
No, he wasn’t sure.	Manan, payqa manan segurochu kasqa.
I know you are happy	Yachanim kusisqa kasqaykita
I wasn’t there	Manam chaypichu karqani
He doesn’t know how.	Manan yachanchu imaynatachus chayta.
Please go there.	Ama hina kaspa chayman riy.
I didn’t see or hear anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu nitaq imatapas uyarirqanichu
I actually agree with that now	Chiqamanta kunanqa chaywanqa acuerdopi kachkani
But that doesn’t necessarily mean he has to go.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa niyta atinmanchu rinan kasqanmanta.
They weren’t human.	Paykunaqa manam runachu karqaku.
She was nervous and cold.	Payqa mancharisqa, chiri ima kasqa.
A few weeks later, he said he had been arrested	Iskay kinsa semana qhepamanmi nirqan hap’isqa kasqanmanta
Boy, it was great.	Wayna, hatunmi karqa.
It was the same process.	Kikin ruwaymi karqan.
Same problem.	Kikin sasachakuy.
That would have been a disaster.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwanman karqa.
I wanted to be there early	Chaypi temprano kaytam munarqani
And don’t eat it.	Hinaspa mana mikhuy.
I'm so proud of you	Sinchi orgulloso kani
I doubt anyone will come today though	Iskayrayani kunan punchaw pipas hamunanta ichaqa
I didn’t want to do that	Manam chayta ruwaytaqa munanichu karqa
Doing a very good job.	Ancha allin llamkayta ruwaspa.
But it was never easy.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas facilchu karqan.
I had no idea you were here last night	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani qayna tuta kaypi kasqaykita
I thought, maybe.	Yuyarqanim, ichapas.
I don’t mean to say	Manam niyta munani
I was a handsome man	Ñuqaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqani
Now, not so much.	Kunanqa, mana anchatachu.
That’s what I am.	Chayna kani.
Man needs work	Runaqa llamk’ayta necesitan
I can't do this all day	Manam tukuy punchawchu kayta ruwayman
I’m still very excited	Hinallam anchata kusikuni
I couldn't do that again	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atirqanichu
I wanted this one.	Kaytaqa munarqani.
I knew this was all new to him	Yacharqanim kayqa paypaq tukuy musuq kasqanmanta
This can be very uncomfortable.	Kayqa ancha mana allinchu kanman.
I still don't remember what happened	Kunankamapas manam yuyarinichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
He wanted more.	Payqa aswan achkatam munarqa.
I didn’t know much about it	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa yacharqani
This is what he does.	Kaytaqa paymi ruwan.
I know you've been there	Yachanim chaypi kasqaykita
Now things began to make sense.	Kunanqa imapas allintam entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
This may seem strange.	Kayqa mana riqsisqa hinam kanman.
It can work very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam llamkayta atin.
I am very much looking forward to it happening	Anchatam suyachkani pasananta
He wants to know who she is.	Payqa pi kasqanmanta yachayta munan.
I can’t be happy	Manam kusisqa kayta atiymanchu
This guy is a very bad guy.	Kay runaqa ancha millay runam.
It’s funny.	Asikunapaq hina.
I don’t want to be here at all	Manam ni imapipas kaypi kayta munanichu
But he did it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwarqan.
This doesn't sound like much.	Kayqa manam ancha hinachu uyarikun.
He didn’t do very well.	Payqa manan ancha allintachu ruwarqan.
But now you act like a man.	Kunanmi ichaqa runa hina ruwanki.
I think he was excited about this	Kaymanta kusisqa kasqanmantam piensani
I was sad, excited, and a little nervous	Llakisqa, kusisqa, huk chhikanta mancharisqa ima karqani
I mean, you know where	Niyta munani, yachankichu maypi
A funny thing happened today	Kunan punchawmi huk asikunapaq hina pasarqa
Yes, there is.	Arí kanmi.
I knew what he meant.	Yacharqanim ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He said nothing like this had ever happened before.	Payqa nirqanmi ñawpaqtaqa mana imapas kay hinaqa pasasqanmanta.
I was sure it was yours	Seguro karqani qanpa kasqanmanta
But it was another day	Ichaqa huk p’unchaymi karqan
This did not go over well.	Kayqa manam allintachu pasarqa.
Maybe it will be faster.	Ichapas aswan utqaylla kanqa.
This is a very difficult one.	Kayqa ancha sasam.
I certainly never heard anything about it	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas uyarirqanichu
I was there for maybe half an hour.	Ichapas kuskan hora chaypi karqani.
But he can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
This can be good or bad.	Kayqa allin utaq mana allin kanman.
He was happy that morning.	Chay paqarinmi kusisqa kasqa.
It was really good, thank you.	Chiqap allinmi karqa, gracias.
I thought it might be too soon	Yuyarqanim ichapas ancha utqaylla kanman nispa
I hope he knows that	Chayta yachananta suyachkani
I would never do that again	Manañam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwaymanchu
I know you still are.	Yachanim kunankamapas chayna kasqaykita.
He can’t hear it.	Mana uyariyta atinchu.
I can't say for sure right now.	Kunanqa manam allintachu niyta atiyman.
I just know something is going to happen	Chaylla yachani imapas pasananta
If not now, that’s all.	Mana kunan kaptinqa, chaylla.
Maybe go with that?.	Ichapas chaywan riy?.
It certainly would have been.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina kanman karqan.
This was going to be a milestone.	Kayqa huk hatun ruwaymi kanan karqa.
Eventually I can handle it	Qhepamanmi chaytaqa manejayta atiyman
You don’t really know that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yachanki.
I knew that was the case	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta
I thought this was a little too easy	Kayqa huk chhikanta ancha facil kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I know this is very true for me.	Yachanim kayqa ñuqapaq ancha chiqap kasqanmanta.
So it’s not the worst.	Chaymi mana aswan mana allinchu.
And then, something strange happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta, imapas mana riqsisqa pasarqa.
Where were they arrested.	Maypitaq hap’isqa karqanku.
I had no reason to refuse	Manam imaraykupas mana munarqanichu
Don't want to say anything.	Ama imatapas niyta munankichu.
And they were happy for a while.	Hinaspa huk tiempo kusisqa karqanku.
I thought he seemed unsure about it.	Yuyarqanim mana seguro hinachu chaypi kasqanmanta.
I would never have done it any other way.	Manam haykapipas huk hinaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
But I knew it would happen	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kananta
Somewhere that doesn’t matter.	Maypipas chay mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I'm afraid that's the case	Manchakuni chayna kasqanta
I know nothing about this	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu
He’s very good at it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypi.
But where.	Ichaqa maypi.
He was a black man.	Payqa yana kasqa.
I want you to be with me	Munani ñoqawan kuska kanaykita
I hope all is well	Tukuy imapas allin kananta suyachkani
I don’t want that to happen here	Manam munanichu kaypi chayna kananta
But that’s not all, he said.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu, nispas nin.
I need him here with me.	Payta kaypi ñuqawan kuska necesitasaq.
He was right here.	Payqa allintam kaypi karqa.
I couldn’t help it	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu
I mean, it's obvious what it is.	Niyta munani, sut'inmi ima kasqanmanta.
He didn’t know her real name.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu cheqaq sutinta.
I wish she was with us today.	Munaymanmi kunan punchaw ñuqaykuwan kananta.
It’s not easy being me.	Manam facilchu ñuqa kayqa.
Is he glad he didn’t now.	¿Kusisqachu kunan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wanted to be somewhere but here	Maypipas kaytam munarqani mana kaypichu
I didn’t do very well.	Manam ancha allintachu ruwarqani.
I didn’t mean to say	Manam niyta munarqanichu
That was a big deal.	Chayqa hatunmi karqa.
He figured out what to do.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ima ruwananta.
I can't really see him	Manam paytaqa chiqaptachu qawayta atiyman
He wanted it, he wanted it.	Payqa munarqa, munarqa.
I know you will be very happy	Yachanim ancha kusisqa kanaykita
I can’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I’ve done it before	Ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqani
It’s all or nothing here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas utaq mana imapas.
The very last one.	Ancha qhipa kaq.
That was tomorrow though.	Chayqa paqarinmi ichaqa karqan.
I want this to be about me	Kay ñuqamanta kananta munani
I have no idea where it is.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi kasqanmanta.
One and then another.	Huk chaymanta huk.
No, he couldn’t believe it.	Manan, manan creeyta atirqanchu.
Now I know for sure.	Kunanqa allintam yachani.
I never could.	Manam haykapipas atirqanichu.
I feel bad about this	Kaymantaqa mana allintam sientekuni
I didn’t want to be like him	Manam pay hina kaytaqa munarqanichu
I’m not the person you want	Manam munasqayki runachu kani
Another big problem, actually.	Huk hatun sasachakuy, chiqaptaqa.
I didn’t really want to know more	Manam anchatachu astawan yachayta munarqani
I want to play too.	Ñuqapas pukllayta munani.
I'm happy, man.	Kusisqam kachkani, runa.
I actually saw him that night	Chiqamanta chay tuta payta rikurqani
I didn’t hear anything	Manam imatapas uyarirqanichu
Always more than that.	Sapa kuti aswan chaymanta.
Unfortunately, he could not speak.	Llakikuypaqmi mana rimayta atirqachu.
And this is yours.	Hinaspa kaymi qanpa.
But that’s what he said, and that was the last thing he did.	Ichaqa chaytan nirqan, chaymi qhepa kaq karqan.
But now I can’t seem to get it right.	Ichaqa kunanqa manañan allintachu ruwayta atiyman hina.
Building a school is the worst part	Yachay wasi ruwaymi aswan mana allinqa
I quickly think of a new way	Usqhayllan huk mosoq ñanta yuyaykuni
Everything about a few weeks ago.	Tukuy imapas yaqa iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I won’t be able to do anything	Manam ima ruwaytapas atisaqchu
I mean eating at home	Wasipi mikhuyta niyta munani
I didn’t want him to get in trouble.	Manam munarqanichu sasachakuypi kananta.
No more time.	Manaña pacha.
The third was the hardest.	Kimsa kaqmi aswan sasa karqa.
There will be.	Kanqa.
I can't let this go	Kaytaqa manam saqiyta atiymanchu
I mean, yeah.	Niyta munani, arí.
I can’t hear it anymore	Manañam uyariyta atiymanchu
Probably about a week in the future.	Yaqapaschá huk semana hina hamuq tiempopi.
One, you don't want it to be true.	Huk, manam munankichu chiqap kananta.
That is, if you do.	Chayqa, qampas chaynata ruwanki chayqa.
I wanted to share that here	Chayta kaypi willayta munarqani
Still, it is not easy to do so.	Chayna kaptinpas manam facilchu chayta ruwayqa.
I never thought of that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa piensarqanichu
You do it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruwanki.
You can fail quickly.	Utqayllam mana allintachu ruwawaq.
It just seems like a good idea.	Allin yuyayniyuq hinallam rikchakun.
More like twenty.	Aswan iskay chunka hina.
Everything will be easier then.	Tukuy imapas chaymantaqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
He couldn’t believe it was true.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu cheqaq kasqanta.
But that was secondary.	Ichaqa chayqa iskay kaqmi karqan.
Today was not the day to do that.	Kunan punchawqa manam chayta ruwanapaq punchawchu karqa.
I'm really sorry but this couldn't wait	Chiqaptam llakikuni ichaqa kayqa manam suyayta atirqachu
It just means it’s harder.	Chaylla niyta munan aswan sasa kasqanmanta.
He wanted to get out of there.	Chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqa.
I don’t want to see him	Manam munanichu payta qawayta
I think you know immediately	Yuyaykuni chay rato yachasqaykita
A man acted alone	Huk runaqa sapallanmi imatapas ruwaq
So it will be.	Chaymi kanqa.
He knew that had to happen first.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaymi ñawpaqtaqa kanan karqan.
I was really with him.	Cheqaqtapunin paywan karqani.
It was a wonderful experience, even in the city.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa, llaqtapi kaptinpas.
Instead, I was very happy	Aswanpas ancha kusisqam karqani
The third time around.	Kimsa kaq kutipi.
He doesn't talk much.	Payqa manam anchatachu riman.
Or okay, okay.	Utaq allinmi, allinmi.
I really need the money	Chiqamanta qullqita necesitasaq
Unless it’s really cold.	Mana chiqap chiri kaptinqa.
You can’t eat without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam mikuyta atiwaqchu.
They were finally here.	Paykunaqa tukukuypi kaypi karqanku.
And there it is.	Hinaspa chaypi.
He didn’t think so.	Payqa manan chaytachu yuyaykurqan.
If so, then it had to be.	Sichus chay hina kanman chayqa, chaymantaqa kanan karqan.
It’s been about two days.	Yaqa iskay punchawmi.
And this was the worst part.	Hinaspa kaymi karqan aswan mana allin kaq.
I still can't believe what happened	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
I didn’t want him to be there	Manam munarqanichu chaypi kananta
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.	Manam pay kaptinqa kunan punchawqa manam kaypichu kayman.
Now I know how bad it is	Kunanqa yachanim chayna mana allin kasqanmanta
He says it’s not the first time he’s done this.	Payqa nin manan ñawpaq kutichu kayta ruwasqanmanta.
You better be there if he does.	Aswan allinmi chaypi kanki pay ruwaptinqa.
I really want to hear from him	Anchatam paymanta uyariyta munani
I would have done the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayman karqa
There is still room for that.	Chaypaqqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
We are good people.	Allin runakunam kanchik.
This is great, you think.	Kayqa ancha allinmi, nispan yuyaykunki.
Tom could see nothing.	Tomqa manam imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.
You know he is guilty.	Yachankim huchayoq kasqanmanta.
Some residents.	Wakin tiyaq runakuna.
So he is doing well on his own.	Chaymi payqa sapallan allinta ruwachkan.
I can't get over how beautiful everything is	Tukuy imapas imayna sumaq kasqanmantaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu
I have to do it right.	Allintam ruwanay kachkan.
I was with that.	Chaywanmi karqani.
That’s what I wanted to do.	Chaytan ruwayta munarqani.
That is no longer a place to live.	Chayqa manañam kanchu huk wasipi tiyayta.
After all, why not.	Tukuy imamanta, ¿imaraykutaq mana.
A successful one, yes	Huk allin ruwaq, arí
I never noticed that	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
That’s what I meant.	Chaynatam niyta munarqani.
I lived there for a while	Chaypim huk tiempo yacharqani
This was this one.	Kayqa kaymi karqan.
I’ll need time.	Tiempotan necesitasaq.
I knew he was disappointed in me	Yacharqanim ñuqamanta hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
I don't know what he means.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He is such a wonderful person.	Payqa chayna sumaq runam.
I probably should have	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay karqan
I can’t stay there any longer	Manañan chaypi qhepakuyta atiymanchu
But it won’t be good.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
Yes, it would be great if it were true.	Arí, ancha allinmi kanman chiqap kaptinqa.
I couldn’t look at him	Manam paytaqa qawayta atirqanichu
I knew you would be	Yacharqanim qam chayna kanaykita
There is a time when you don’t want anything.	Huk tiempon kan mana imatapas munaspaqa.
Who knows, man.	Pi yachan, runa.
I really wanted to know that	Chaytaqa anchatam yachayta munarqani
I didn’t know how to fix this	Manam yacharqanichu kayta imayna allichayta
Okay, never do that.	Allinmi, chayta mana hayk’aqpas ruway.
He knows better than he does.	Payqa aswan allintam yachan.
The simplicity is overwhelming.	Chay mana sasa ruwayqa sinchi hatunmi.
So, very sickly.	Chaymi, ancha unqusqa.
Unfortunately he couldn’t do that.	Llakikuypaqmi mana chayta ruwayta atirqachu.
I can talk more next week	Hamuq semanapi astawan rimayta atiyman
I couldn’t tell who they were.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu pikuna kasqankuta.
That’s what I said the next time we did that	Chaytan nirqani qhepa kutipi chayta ruwanaykupaq
I want it half ahead of time	Kuskan ñawpaqmantaraqmi munani
I didn’t know how this could happen	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kayqa kanman chayta
Together they are him.	Kuska paymi kanku.
I heard about it yesterday	Qayna punchawmi chaymanta uyarirqani
I want to help you, he said	Yanapayta munani, nispa
I don’t know what, but it’s good.	Mana yachanichu ima, ichaqa allinmi.
This time I mean that.	Kay kutipi chayta niyta munani.
I didn’t mean this	Manam kayta niyta munarqanichu
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chayna?.
He wasn’t good for anything.	Payqa manan imapaqpas allinchu karqan.
I wanted to know more about him	Paymanta astawan yachayta munarqani
So it’s very.	Chaymi ancha.
I think he's injured.	Yuyaykuni k'irisqa kasqanmanta.
I suspect it is untrue.	Mana chiqap kasqanmantam sospechani.
I know you are right	Yachanim allinta nisqaykita
I thought tonight would be better for me	Yuyarqanim kunan tuta ñuqapaq aswan allin kananta
You're going to be injured.	K'irisqa kanki.
I just didn’t expect you home so early	Chaylla mana suyarqanichu wasiykiman chay hina temprano
I wanted to beat him, to be better	Payta atipayta munarqani, aswan allin kanaypaq
I wanted to take a closer look at this.	Kaytaqa allintam qawayta munarqani.
I made some lunch.	Wakin almuerzota ruwarqani.
I want you to be sure	Seguro kanaykita munani
I can’t go there.	Chaymanqa manam riyta atiymanchu.
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Yacharqanim kayqa chiqap mana allin kananta.
I knew almost nothing about who he was now though	Yaqa mana imatapas yacharqanichu kunan pi kasqanmanta ichaqa
I am very sorry about that	Anchatam llakikuni chaymanta
I knew it was good.	Yacharqanim allin kasqanmanta.
I didn’t realize how important they were at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan repararqanichu ancha importante kasqankuta
I didn’t want to believe him	Manam paytaqa creeyta munarqanichu
I can’t be with you anymore	Manañam qamwan kayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t believe it just happened	Mana creeyta atirqanichu chaylla chay pasasqanmanta
Nothing always.	Mana imapas sapa kuti.
He goes every year.	Payqa sapa wata rin.
There are very few people here.	Kaypiqa ancha pisi runakunam kan.
That’s really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi.
But I stopped thinking about it	Ichaqa manañan chaypi yuyaykurqanichu
He felt sad.	Llakisqa hinam tarikurqa.
And a man.	Hinaspa huk runa.
I said that it was	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqani
And that's what happened here.	Hinaspa chaymi kaypi pasarqa.
It seems every day.	Sapa punchawmi rikchakun.
I would never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
It couldn't have been easier.	Manam aswan facilchu kanman karqa.
Hopefully it will be quick.	Munayman utqaylla kananta.
I mean, very few people	Niyta munani, ancha pisi runakuna
I need to do that more often	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kutim ruwanay
But he must do it quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanan.
If not, please do.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa ruway.
But he learned quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan yacharqan.
I know how hard it is	Yachanim imayna sasa kasqanmanta
I don’t really like anyone right now	Kunanqa manan pitapas anchatachu gustan
I didn’t know where to go	Manam yacharqanichu maymanpas rinaypaq
I know he doesn't want to	Yachanim mana munasqanmanta
I want to be someone who does that	Chayta ruwaq runa kaytam munani
But he couldn’t do everything.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I just said who they were, that's all	Chayllam nirqani pikuna kasqankuta, chaylla
I just thought it was funny	Chaytaqa asikunapaq hinallam piensarqani
It’s big, it’s hard.	Hatunmi, sasam.
Perhaps you have done so.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqanki.
What a new thing.	Ima musuq kaqmi.
I just didn’t listen	Chaylla mana uyarirqanichu
I am now the happiest person in the world	Kunanqa kay pachapi aswan kusisqa runam kani
I wanted to tell you about it	Chaymanta willayta munarqani
I expect more to come	Suyachkani aswan hamunanta
He often had no choice.	Sapa kutim mana ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
In fact, everything that comes with it.	Chiqaptaqa, tukuy ima chaywan hamuq.
You don’t quite know why or how.	Mana allintachu yachanki imarayku nitaq imaynatachus chayta.
He looked at her sternly.	Payqa sinchitan qhawarirqan.
I couldn’t hold it	Manam hapiyta atirqanichu
Maybe next weekend.	Ichapas hamuq semana tukuyta.
You know a lot, right?	Anchatan yachanki, hinan.
And very smart.	Hinaspa ancha yachaysapa.
He seems very nervous.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
It was strong.	Sinchi kasqa.
I just feel tired	Chayllam sayk’usqa hina tarikuni
It all sounds so amazing.	Tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi uyarikun.
But it’s not that difficult.	Ichaqa manan chhayna sasachu.
That’s what he can do.	Chaytan payqa ruwanman.
I have been here a few times	Iskay kimsa kutitam kaypi karqani
I couldn’t be that person	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu karqa
That makes it wrong out there.	Chaywanmi chay hawapi pantasqa kachkan.
This needs immediate action.	Kayqa chaylla ruwayta necesitan.
I think you know what to do	Yuyaykuni imata ruwanaykipaq yachasqaykita
He didn't know why he was angry.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
They were usually better.	Yaqa llapanpim aswan allin karqaku.
I really thought they were better than that	Chiqaptam chaymanta aswan allin kasqankuta piensarqani
I think he is really speaking	Chiqaptam rimachkan nispaymi piensani
It means a lot, it really does.	Achkatam niyta munan, chiqaptam niyta munan.
He never agreed with me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqawanqa acuerdopichu karqa.
It was good, really good.	Allinmi karqa, chiqap allinmi karqa.
Isn't it more, he wants to ask.	Manachu aswan, tapuyta munan.
I wanted to be that person	Chay runa kaytam munarqani
It sounds obvious.	Sut’inmi uyarikun.
What did you say about it.	Imamantataq nirqanki.
I know he’s with you	Yachanin qanwan kashasqanmanta
I thought you were older	Yuyarqanim kuraq kanki nispa
I get in trouble a few times	Iskay kimsa kutitam sasachakuypi tarikuni
I think everyone knows who they are.	Yuyaykuni llapa runa yachanku pikuna kasqankuta.
I don’t want to tell you why	Manam munanichu imarayku kasqanmanta willayta
He certainly gave it to her.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa qorqan.
He took a good look at what had happened.	Payqa allintan qhawarirqan imachus pasasqanmanta.
I think that is difficult	Chayqa sasa kasqanmantam piensani
I thought this would be easy	Kayqa facilmi kananta yuyaykurqani
We did that today.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwarqayku.
He wasn’t in a hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu karqan.
He could not overcome it.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atirqachu.
It’s not me though.	Manam ñuqachu ichaqa.
He goes there twice a day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi iskay kutita chayman rin.
This will be a good thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi kanqa.
Never existed before.	Mana hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa karqanchu.
I want to ask him what his name is	Payta tapuyta munani ima sutin kasqanmanta
I wonder what he’s talking about	Tapukuni imamantataq rimachkan
It wasn’t the first time he’d tried a book	Manan ñawpaq kutichu huk librota ruwayta munarqan
I want nothing to do with him.	Manam munanichu paywan ima ruwaytapas.
I didn’t expect it to be mine	Manam suyarqanichu ñuqapa kananta
And then in the morning.	Hinaspa chaymanta tutamanta.
Now he knows better.	Kunanmi ichaqa aswan allinta yachan.
It was too good for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay allinmi karqa.
He is the one I want to do better.	Paymi aswan allinta ruwayta munani.
I mean, then .	Niyta munani, chaymanta .
I hope you did that all along	Chayta tukuy tiempo ruwasqaykita suyachkani
He is here with me now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqawan kaypi kachkan.
I know you’re scared	Yachanin mancharisqa kasqaykita
Everything seemed fine, but something was very wrong.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa, ichaqa imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
He told me to tell him he wasn't here.	Niwarqa mana kaypi kasqanmanta willanaypaq.
Really bad, actually.	Chiqamanta mana allin, chiqamanta.
I know you want to see it.	Yachanim qawayta munasqaykita.
The important thing was the people involved	Importante kaqmi karqan chaypi kaq runakuna
Not sure why that happened.	Mana segurochu imarayku chay pasasqanmanta.
I didn’t know where he lived	Manam yacharqanichu maypi yachasqanmanta
He didn’t know where or how to do it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi nitaq imayna ruwananta.
I didn't want to talk about what just happened	Chayllaraq pasasqanmantaqa manam rimayta munarqanichu
I almost saw it	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa rikurqani
I cannot believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu
Now he realized she was gone.	Kunanqa repararqanmi manaña kashasqanmanta.
He can't, he can't.	Mana atinchu, mana atinchu.
to the right.	chayman.
I'll be caught.	Hap'isqa kasaq.
They were the ones.	Chayna karqaku.
I knew it was probably nothing	Yacharqanim manapaschá imapas kasqanmanta
So the man couldn't get anything.	Chayraykum chay runaqa mana imatapas hapiyta atirqachu.
I don’t like it here anymore	Kaypiqa manañam gustawanchu
He didn’t know how else.	Payqa manan huk imayna kananta yacharqanchu.
I didn’t want that for him	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu paypaq
I knew exactly what he meant	Allintam yacharqani ima niyta munasqanmanta
I had to do it right	Allintam ruwanay karqa
I know you have to do it	Yachanim ruwanayki kasqanmanta
I will be doing this a lot	Kaytaqa anchatam ruwasaq
That is not difficult to do.	Chayqa manan sasachu ruwayqa.
That was a few weeks ago.	Chayqa karqa iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I wonder who did that	Pi chayta ruwarqa nispa tapukuni
Do whatever you want with it.	Chaywanqa munasqaykita ruway.
The right people at the right time.	Allin runakuna allin tiempopi.
But I couldn’t hear it	Ichaqa manan uyariyta atirqanichu
I pretended it wouldn't come	Mana hamunanta hinam ruwarqani
People are here to stay.	Runakuna kaypi kachkanku.
I wish he was here now.	Munaymanmi kunan kaypi kananta.
Instead of ?.	Chaymantaqa ?.
I just couldn’t take this anymore	Chaylla manaña kayta hap’iyta atirqanichu
She said it happened so fast.	Payqa nirqam chayna utqaylla pasasqanmanta.
I want to see what else is out there	Munani qawayta imakuna huk hawapi kasqanmanta
I couldn’t sleep that night	Chay tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqanichu
Tired but good.	Sayk’usqa ichaqa allin.
You can continue with it.	Chaywanqa hinallam ruwawaq.
I will be with you	Ñoqaqa qanwan kuskan kasaq
I never want to be him again.	Manañam haykapipas pay kayta munanichu.
Of course, that’s all there is to it .	Chiqamanta, chaymantaqa chaylla .
I just know what he's thinking	Chaylla yachani ima piensasqanmanta
That one was the worst.	Chay hukninmi aswan millay karqa.
They were both of them.	Iskayninkum karqaku.
I can’t deal with that now	Kunanqa manan chaywanqa atipayta atiymanchu
Why would anyone want him.	¿Imaraykutaq pipas payta munanman.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Paqarinmi ruwasaq.
He thought he could do it.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwayta atinman nispa.
Almost immediately.	Yaqa chayllaraqmi.
Then you.	Chaymanta qam.
I wish he would come over	Munaymanmi chayman hamunanta
He said, 'It's.	Payqa nirqam.
I really want to see him	Anchatam payta qawayta munani
I never saw it coming	Manam haykapipas hamunanta rikurqanichu
I know where you did it	Yachanim maypi ruwasqaykita
I didn’t know what happened	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasasqanmanta
I really need the sleep	Anchatam necesitasaq chay puñuyta
I never get that again	Manañam haykapipas chaytaqa tarinichu
So it’s very much.	Chaymi anchata.
I didn’t expect anything	Manam imatapas suyarqanichu
I didn’t want to go	Manam riyta munarqanichu
I knew what it was like	Yacharqanim chayna imayna kasqanmanta
Probably not so much.	Yaqapaschá mana anchatachu.
I knew it was going to be hard	Yacharqanim sasa kananta
No, it was much sadder than that.	Manan, chaymantaqa aswan llakikuypaqmi karqan.
I think that's a good thing	Chayqa allinpaq kasqanmantam piensani
You want money.	Qolqetan munanki.
I’m not sure it’s the right thing to do.	Manam segurochu kani allin ruway kasqanmanta.
I can’t really.	Manam chiqaptaqa atiymanchu.
I didn’t want to be alone anymore	Manañam sapallay kayta munarqanichu
I can’t understand that	Chaytaqa manan entiendeyta atiymanchu
I never thought it would happen so fast	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna utqaylla pasananta
I can't work.	Manam llamkayta atinichu.
He will be happy to do it.	Payqa kusisqam ruwanqa.
I didn’t want to go crazy	Manam loco kaytaqa munarqanichu
It was a good thing for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi karqa.
You have a lot to do.	Achka ruwanayki kachkan.
I thought about that for a while	Chaypin huk tiempo yuyaykurqani
He was such a nice guy about it.	Payqa chayna sumaq runam karqa chaymanta.
But he may have no choice.	Ichaqa manapaschá ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
This is completely wrong	Kayqa tukuy imamanta mana allinchu kachkan
I didn't think he would	Manam piensarqanichu chayta ruwananta
It seemed so easy.	Ancha facilmi rikchakurqa.
He knew what was going to happen now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan imakuna kananta.
I wasn’t thinking.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani.
He had to be there.	Payqa chaypim kanan karqa.
I feel strongly about it	Chaywanmi sinchita sientekuni
I know it’s going to be hard	Yachanim sasa kananta
I can’t really tell you what it’s like.	Mana allintachu willayta atiyman imayna kasqanmanta.
I really wanted to talk to him	Paywan rimayta anchatam munarqani
We have been friends for a long time.	Unayñan amigontin kayku.
That makes no sense at the time.	Chayqa manan chay tiempopiqa imapaqpas valenchu.
I didn’t really think about it	Chaypiqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani
I’m so excited about it!	¡Ancha kusisqam kachkani!
So tell me now.	Chaymi kunan willaway.
I mean if you want to	Munaspaqa niyta munani
If there is time.	Tiempo kaptinqa.
I didn’t want to at all	Manam ni imapipas munarqanichu
So it was.	Chaymi karqa.
Here, he says.	Kaypi, nispas nin.
Now, he couldn’t do that.	Kunanqa, manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I hear this all the time	Kaytaqa sapa kutim uyarini
I think outside.	Yuyaykuni hawapi.
It’s the first one ever.	Ñawpaq kaqmi hayk’aqpas.
I want to learn as much as you do.	Ñuqapas qam hinam yachayta munani.
I knew what had to be done	Yacharqanim ima ruwana kasqanmanta
I couldn't tell what he was thinking.	Manam willayta atirqanichu ima piensasqanmanta.
I wonder if anyone really could	Tapukunitaqmi sichus pipas chiqaptapuni atinman karqa
What’s the right thing to do.	Imataq allin kaq.
There is nothing I can do to help him	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu payta yanapanaypaq
That is a difficult thing to do.	Chaytaqa sasa ruwaymi.
I am very happy with it	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chaywan
I know you mean well	Yachanim allinta niyta munasqaykita
I’m not sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani
I can’t believe you knew all this time	Mana creeyta atiymanchu tukuy kay tiempo yachasqaykita
It got a lot out of him.	Achkatam paymanta hurqurqa.
They are really good.	Chiqaptam allin kanku.
I was ready for more.	Astawan ruwanaypaqmi listo karqani.
But he wanted to get out.	Ichaqa lluqsiyta munarqa.
He stayed there for three years.	Chaypin kinsa wata qhepakurqan.
Yes, it is good	Arí, allinmi .
Indeed, this is the case now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa chay hina kashan.
I didn’t think it would work.	Manam piensarqanichu allin kananta.
I need to do this for myself	Kaytaqa ñuqapaq ruwanay tiyan
I know the right way	Yachanim allin ñanta
You could have done the same thing.	Qampas chaynatam ruwawaq karqa.
He had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I can’t play anymore	Manañam pukllayta atinichu
They were strangers.	Mana riqsisqa runakunam karqaku.
I couldn’t get over it	Manam atipayta atirqanichu
It didn’t take long.	Manam unaytachu pasarqa.
That’s the only thing hidden.	Chayllam pakasqa kachkan.
I want to be a good person	Allin runa kaytam munani
I don’t know why anyone would be otherwise.	Mana yachanichu imaraykun pipas huk hina kanman chayta.
It really couldn't be better.	Chiqaptaqa manam aswan allinchu kanman.
I always thought it would	Sapa kutim piensarqani chayna kananta
I am not sure if he is happy or sad	Manam segurochu kani kusisqachu icha llakisqa kasqanmantaqa
I want to know more about this	Kaymanta astawan yachayta munani
I listened to them carefully.	Chaykunataqa allintam uyarirqani.
Yes, maybe.	Arí, ichapas.
I didn’t want it or want it.	Manam munarqanichu nitaq munarqanichu.
It just seems like it.	Chayllaraqmi rikchakun.
If you want this feature right now.	Sichus kunanpacha kay ruwayta munanki.
I tried to answer but it seemed too big	Kutichiyta munarqani ichaqa ancha hatunmi rikchakurqa
You’re a good young man.	Allin wayna kasqaykita.
I couldn’t say one way or another	Manam huk hinata huk hinata niyta atirqanichu
I kinda know what you mean though	Ñuqaqa huk laya yachani ima niyta munanki ichaqa
I’m not the only one	Manam ñuqallachu kani
And that someone out there is the worst.	Hinaspa chay hawapi pipas aswan mana allinqa kasqanmanta.
I never saw that coming	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chay hamunanta
I didn't realize that	Chaytaqa manam repararqanichu
I wish it was mine	Munaymanmi ñuqapa kanman
He should be here.	Payqa kaypim kanan.
I am a human being	Huk runam kani
I mean, that’s pretty important out there.	Niyta munani, chayqa ancha importante chay hawapi.
This process needs to be done in two steps, however.	Kay ruwaytaqa iskay ruwaypi ruwana tiyan, ichaqa.
Please be like that.	Ama hina kaspa chay hina kay.
He didn’t always do that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq.
I always wanted to finish my studies	Sapa kutim estudiayta tukuyta munarqani
I wasn’t ready for anything like that	Manam chayna imapaqpas listochu karqani
I know it means a lot to you	Yachanim qampaq ancha allin kasqanmanta
I think now is the right time	Yuyaykuni kunanqa allin tiempo kasqanmanta
I felt like a different person.	Huk runa hinam tarikurqani.
I know it's not that easy	Yachanim mana chayna facil kasqanmanta
Yes, that is amazing.	Arí, chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
He’s worried about everything this evening.	Payqa kay ch’isi tukuy imamanta llakisqa kachkan.
Then last night he had a letter to go home	Chaymantaqa qayna tutam huk cartata wasinman rinan karqa
This wouldn’t be right!.	¡Kayqa manam allinchu kanman!.
I know something is wrong	Yachanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
A beautiful girl can do anything	Sumaq sipasmi tukuy imatapas ruwayta atin
He wasn't ready to talk to her yet.	Payqa manaraqmi listochu kasqa paywan rimananpaq.
He would do well for her.	Payqa allintan ruwanman paypaq.
That’s how I learned in prison	Chaynatam carcelpi yacharqani
No one is right.	Manan pipas allinchu.
Looks good, sounds great.	Allinmi rikchakun, ancha allinmi uyarikun.
You couldn’t have stopped him.	Manam harkayta atiwaqchu karqa.
Instead, do something about it.	Aswanpas imatapas ruway.
Now I know this is true	Kunanqa yachanim kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta
That's why I know pretty much what's going on	Chayraykum yaqa imakuna pasasqanmanta yachani
I knew it was important	Yacharqanim ancha allin kasqanmanta
I heard it went very well	Uyarirqanim ancha allinta risqanmanta
It must be done.	Ruwaymi kanan.
That is completely wrong.	Chayqa llapanpim pantasqa kachkan.
I am not ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manam listochu kani.
I didn’t want to deal with it	Chaywanqa manam atipayta munarqanichu
That worked out fine.	Chayqa allintam lluqsirqa.
Very, very hungry.	Ancha, ancha yarqasqa.
As if happy.	Kusisqa hina.
I don't care how fast everything happens.	Manam imananpaschu imayna utqaylla tukuy imapas pasasqanmantaqa.
This is it or this is it, he says.	Kaymi icha kaymi, nispas nin.
I want to know where they are	Maypi kasqankuta yachayta munani
It's too good to be true, that's it.	Ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq, chaymi.
Otherwise, he said the patient was fine.	Mana chayqa, unqusqa allin kasqanmanta nirqa.
I couldn’t understand how anyone could sleep.	Manan entiendeyta atirqanichu imaynatas pipas puñuyta atinman chayta.
He might have been mad at me.	Payqa ichapas ñuqapaq phiñasqa kanman karqa.
I don’t know how we did that.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta ruwarqayku chayta.
This guy is crazy.	Kay runaqa loco hinam.
It wasn’t something he always wanted to do.	Manan sapa kutilla ruway munasqanman hinachu karqan.
I mean if you think about it.	Niyta munani sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
I couldn’t stop him	Manam harkayta atirqanichu
There is indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin kan.
I do it all the time	Tukuy tiempon chayta ruwani
No one knows what time it is.	Manam pipas yachanchu ima hora kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t remember what it was	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I know that, for sure.	Chaytaqa yachanim, seguro.
I knew who this guy was.	Ñoqaqa yacharqanim pi kay runa kasqanmanta.
Me, not so much.	Ñuqa, mana anchatachu.
I can't do it tonight	Kunan tutaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
He died later that year.	Chay wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
There is no such thing as a statement.	Chayna rimayqa manam kanchu.
That would be, you know, very serious.	Chayqa kanman, yachanki, ancha serio.
Most people know anyway.	Yaqa llapan runakunam imayna kaptinpas yachanku.
It’s a beauty.	Sumaq kaymi.
I’ve already said too much	Ñam llumpayta nirqani
Someone gave me that opportunity.	Pipas chay oportunidadta quwarqa.
First of all, it looks nice.	Ñawpaqtaqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
I knew what was going on.	Yacharqanim imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I think it was good	Allinmi karqan nispaymi yuyaykuni
Not anymore, tonight.	Manaña, kunan tuta.
I couldn’t sleep all night	Tukuy tutan mana puñuyta atirqanichu
Here’s the one.	Kaypi chayta.
He wanted to catch her.	Payqa payta hap’iyta munarqan.
But now it’s real easy.	Ichaqa kunanqa cheqaq facilmi.
I suspect they are not	Sospechani mana chayna kasqankuta
I'm a slow mover.	Lliwmi kani.
That was kind of a good thing.	Chayqa huk laya allin kaqmi karqa.
I agree, it's really important	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani, chiqaptam ancha allin
But it’s not very easy.	Ichaqa manan ancha facilchu.
Shouldn’t it be?.	¿Manachu kanan?.
I didn't think it was	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
I was sure of this	Kaymantaqa segurom karqani
I want to know what happens to him after that	Chay qhepamanmi paywan imachus pasananta yachayta munani
I was pretty happy	Allin kusisqam karqani
I will never need it again	Manañam haykapipas necesitasaqchu
Something just happened.	Chayllaraqmi imapas pasarqa.
It’s easier for me to get to in the morning	Aswan facilmi tutamanta chayayta atiyman
There seems to be something here.	Kaypiqa imapas kanman hinam.
But the first real first time won’t happen before this day.	Ichaqa ñawpaq chiqap ñawpaq kuti mana kanqachu manaraq kay p’unchaw.
I didn’t want it to look like that	Manam munarqanichu chay rikchayniyuq kananta
Anywhere, anywhere.	Maypipas, maypipas.
But you’re in luck.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kanki.
Whatever it is, someone wants it.	Imapas kaptinqa pipas munan.
Very good, actually.	Ancha allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
Now those two.	Kunanqa chay iskay.
I mean, you didn't really have to	Niyta munani, manam chiqaptachu ruwanayki karqa
That was true a week ago.	Chayqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi chiqap karqa.
It’s a very impressive thing.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi.
I think that would be good for him	Chayqa allinmi kanman paypaq, nispan yuyaykuni
I didn’t really hear it	Manam chiqaptachu uyarirqani
Unfortunately, that’s the worst part.	Llakikuypaqmi, chaymi aswan mana allin kaq.
I knew how he felt.	Yacharqanim imayna sientekusqanmanta.
That’s what he would have done.	Chaytan payqa ruwanman karqan.
I didn’t know his name	Manam sutinta yacharqanichu
I was last, as usual	Ñuqaqa qhipa kaqmi karqani, sapa kuti hina
I didn’t realize he was here	Manam repararqanichu kaypi kasqanmantaqa
He is constantly overthinking everything.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi tukuy imatapas nishuta yuyaykushan.
I could do this all day	Tukuy punchawmi kayta ruwayman karqa
And they know that.	Hinaspa chaytaqa yachanku.
I wish he hadn't	Munaymanmi mana chayta ruwaptinqa
If you can’t do that, .	Sichus mana chayta ruwayta atiwaqchu chayqa, .
Every day is smart.	Sapa punchawmi yachaysapa.
But now tell me.	Kunanmi ichaqa willaway.
Such is the truth.	Chay hinaqa cheqaq kaymi.
But he was lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi karqan.
I didn’t want to eat it	Manam mikhuyta munarqanichu
Some things, anyway.	Wakin imakuna, imayna kaptinpas.
Something to do, finally.	Imapas ruwanapaq, tukukuypi.
I want that to be true.	Chaytaqa munani.
I don’t see why you’d want to.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa munasqaykita.
I’m not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kani.
Do it in three steps.	Kimsa ruwaypi ruway.
I didn't want to dwell on it for long	Chaypiqa manam unaytachu yuyaymanayta munarqani
But he stayed with you.	Paymi ichaqa qanwan qhepakurqan.
Maybe I was.	Ichapas karqani.
I have to do that first	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanay
I certainly never did	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
I did what he said was right	Allin nisqanman hinam ruwarqani
This is about nothing.	Kayqa mana imamantapas.
I know what it was like in the past	Yachanim ñawpaqpi imayna kasqanmanta
I can be evil quickly	Usqhaylla millay kayman
But something more.	Ichaqa imapas aswan.
Never in that city.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay llaqtapi.
Yes, it is very good.	Arí, ancha allinmi.
I couldn't catch it in time	Manam tiempollanpi hapiyta atirqanichu
I’m not a morning person	Manam paqarin runachu kani
What was that that was.	Imataq chay karqa.
It was such a day.	Chayna punchawmi karqa.
I can’t imagine why I wouldn’t.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imarayku mana chayta ruwanaypaqqa.
I highly doubt it though	Anchatam iskayrayani ichaqa
There is no time.	Manam tiempo kanchu.
Now I want to do that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwayta munani.
Worried that something was wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmanta llakisqa.
I want to make sure you do it immediately.	Chaylla ruwanaykipaqmi seguro kayta munani.
I just couldn’t believe it was me	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu ñuqa kasqayta

This was simple but very effective.	Kayqa facilmi karqa ichaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I don’t understand it at all	Manam imapipas entiendenichu
I listened carefully, but heard nothing	Allintam uyarirqani, ichaqa manam imatapas uyarirqanichu
I guess that wouldn't be too bad	Chayqa manam ancha mana allinchu kanman, nispaymi
I know he plans to do that	Yachanim chay ruwayta yuyaykusqanmanta
Not always available.	Mana sapa kutichu tarikun.
He was the first to speak.	Paymi ñawpaqtaqa rimarqan.
Or the head.	Utaq uma.
I've never done anything like that	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwarqanichu
I was really proud of him	Cheqaqtapunin paymanta orgulloso karqani
I know what he did	Yachanim ima ruwasqanmanta
And he wants something.	Hinaspa imatapas munan.
I just haven't heard it many times	Chaylla mana achka kutita uyarirqanichu
And that’s what you did.	Hinaspa chaytan ruwarqanki.
I didn’t really want to eat.	Manam anchatachu mikhuyta munarqani.
I can be very sure that didn’t happen	Ancha seguro kayman mana chay pasasqanmanta
I’ll be here tomorrow	Paqarinmi kaypi kasaq
You really can’t do it.	Chiqaptaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Something is good, he said.	Imapas allinmi, nispa.
I really hope it does	Chiqaptam suyachkani chayna kananpaq
I knew he wasn't serious	Yacharqanim mana serio kasqanmanta
I guess the best way to do this	Suyachkani aswan allin ruway kayta ruwanapaq
I haven’t seen them before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaykunataqa rikurqanichu
All the people.	Llapan runakuna.
I love talking to you	Anchatan gustan qanwan rimayqa
Maybe he had an idea.	Ichapas huk yuyayniyuq karqa.
He wanted, perhaps, to do a lot of things.	Payqa munarqa, ichapas, achka ruwaykunata ruwayta.
I think it’s going to be nice	Yuyaykuni sumaqmi kanqa
I usually want the villain to win.	Yaqa llapanpim munani chay millay runa atipananta.
I won’t do it again.	Manam hukmanta ruwasaqchu.
I could be here for three years.	Kimsa wata kaypi kayta atiyman.
I knew what he was thinking	Yacharqanim ima piensasqanmanta
I knew it would happen, though	Yacharqanim chayna kananta, ichaqa
He said he didn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan nispa.
I am so sorry for what just happened	Anchatan llakikuni chayllaraq pasasqanmanta
I like money.	Qolqetan gustan.
I just can’t talk about it	Chaylla mana chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
I can't find this one.	Kaytaqa manam tariyta atinichu.
I mean, this is really good	Niyta munani, kayqa chiqap allinmi
I didn’t know this was a thing	Manam yacharqanichu kay imapas kasqanmanta
He is not like him today.	Payqa manan kunan tiempopi pay hinachu.
Maybe he’s scared.	Ichapas payqa mancharisqa kachkan.
That’s you.	Chay qam.
It was pretty obvious why.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan imarayku.
I can’t go again.	Manam hukmanta riyta atiymanchu.
I know what he needs	Yachanim ima necesitasqanmanta
There was no easy way to do this.	Chaypaqqa manan facil ruwayqa karqanchu.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imarayku.
It looked like he wanted to do that.	Chayta ruwayta munasqanman hinam rikchakurqa.
There, he says.	Chaypi, nispas nin.
He spoke for a while.	Payqa huk rato rimarqan.
I don’t know where he went.	Manam yachanichu mayman risqanmanta.
He was never here before.	Manam haykapipas kaypiqa karqachu.

But I’m not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu kani.
I mean, you can’t answer	Niyta munani, mana kutichiyta atiwaqchu
But at least it would be good.	Ichaqa aswanpas allinmi kanman.

Caught up with him.	Paywan hapisqa.

I couldn’t do it	Manam atirqanichu
He was furious that night.	Chay tutaqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
I’m fine with that.	Allinmi kani chaymanta.
That is still not a good thing.	Chayqa kunankamapas manam allinchu.

Everything seems to be there.	Tukuy imapas chaypi hinam kachkan.

It doesn’t do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwan.
I’m so sorry this happened	Anchatan llakikuni kay pasasqanmanta
You have no idea what he’s doing.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki ima ruwasqanmanta.
Maybe I’ll do it a while longer	Ichapas huk tiempo aswan unayta ruwasaq
Said this month.	Nisqa kay killapi.
I wanted to make sure that was there	Chayqa chaypi kananpaqmi seguro kayta munarqani
I don’t want to see it.	Manam rikuyta munanichu.
I knew you were ready to do anything	Yacharqanim imatapas ruwanaykipaq listo kasqaykita
But I do with it.	Ichaqa chaywanmi ruwani.
I couldn't believe how good it was	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna allin kasqanmanta
He doesn’t care, he does it hard.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, sinchitan ruwan.
You don’t know about it.	Manam chaymantaqa yachankichu.
There are a lot of people	Achka runakunam kan
It just means what it says.	Nisqanman hinallam niyta munan.
We are very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kanchik.
Another twenty.	Huk iskay chunka.
This was an amazing experience.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I would be very upset	Sinchi llakisqa kayman
He refused to go with her.	Payqa manan paywan riyta munarqanchu.
I am sure of that	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani
Now, there is some interesting action.	Kunanqa, wakin sumaq ruwaymi kachkan.
I sat most of the time	Yaqa llapan tiempotan tiyaq kani
Go on, man.	Riy, runa.
That’s what people are like.	Chaynatam runakunaqa kanku.
He doesn’t like to repeat himself.	Payqa manan gustanchu yapamanta rimayqa.
But it’s very much like you.	Ichaqa ancha qan hinan.
This is the first morning.	Kayqa ñawpaq paqarinmi.
He was very intelligent.	Payqa ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
But someone will do it.	Ichaqa pipas chayta ruwanqa.
I knew they were.	Yacharqanim chayna kasqankuta.
I hadn’t heard of it	Manam chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu
I was as surprised as anyone	Pipas hinam admirakurqani
But no one said anything.	Ichaqa manan pipas imatapas nirqanchu.
That did not happen today.	Chayqa manam kunan punchawchu pasarqa.
And well, it didn’t work out.	Hinaspa allinmi, mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Unfortunately, that doesn't make it easier than it sounds.	Llakikuypaqmi, chaywanqa manam facilchu kasqanmantaqa.
But I didn’t realize you did that right	Ichaqa manan repararqanichu chayta allinta ruwasqaykita
He is speaking the truth.	Payqa chiqaptam rimachkan.
I wasn’t ready for us to do that before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan listochu karqani chayta ruwanaykupaq
It’s good here.	Kaypiqa allinmi.
I wanted to be outside	Hawapi kaytam munarqani
I prefer it that way	Chaynatam aswan allinpaq hapini
There is no such thing as a person.	Manam chayna runaqa kanchu.
He was the best.	Paymi aswan allinqa karqan.
Black as the night.	Tuta hina yana.
You're doing it.	Ruwanki.
He couldn’t stop.	Manas saqiyta atirqachu.
And so quickly.	Hinaspa chayna utqaylla.
I really thought he was a nice guy	Cheqaqtapunin yuyaykurqani sumaq runa kananpaq
Unfortunately they were too late.	Llakikuypaqmi paykunaqa ancha tarde karqaku.
I didn’t want to know this	Kaytaqa manam yachayta munarqanichu
That is rather unfortunate.	Chayqa aswan llakikuypaqmi.
I really wanted to go	Sinchitan riyta munarqani
That’s something about you.	Chayqa qanmanta kaqmi.
What do you do.	Imatataq ruwanki.
Either you are or you are not.	Icha kanki icha manachu kanki.
Night and day.	Tuta punchaw.
That’s no big deal.	Chayqa manan hatun ruwaychu.
He was really very nice indeed.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq karqa chiqaptapuni.
They really weren't sure.	Paykunaqa chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqaku.
I couldn’t understand him	Manam paytaqa entiendeyta atirqanichu
It is faster than it is not.	Aswan utqayllam mana kaptinqa.
He was such a man.	Chayna runam karqa.
I hope it will be there this morning	Suyachkani kunan paqarin chaypi kananta
You can’t help that.	Chaytaqa manam yanapayta atiwaqchu.
A month later, he died	Chaymanta huk killa qhepamanmi payqa wañupurqan
I really thought he was a nice guy	Chiqaptam piensarqani sumaq runa kananpaq
I didn’t want to know anymore	Manañam yachayta munarqanichu
That’s not really the case.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu.
I don't know if there's anything out there.	Mana yachanichu chay hawapi imapas kanchu icha manachu chayta.
I wasn’t drunk enough	Manam allintachu machasqa karqani
People who are there want to be there.	Chaypi kaq runakunaqa chaypi kaytam munanku.
No one knows what’s going on.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
He couldn’t work.	Payqa manan llank’ayta atirqanchu.
A cold night.	Huk chiri tuta.
He repeats it well.	Payqa allintam yapamanta riman.
I don’t want to say why	Manam imarayku niyta munanichu
I couldn’t leave yet	Manaraqmi ripuyta atirqanichu
I have no idea what would happen.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imataq kanman chayta.
I would love to hang out with you	Anchatan munani qanwan kuska tiyayta
That meant something.	Chayqa imapas niyta munarqa.
I didn’t want him to know	Manam munarqanichu yachananta
That meant being better.	Chayqa aswan allin kaymi niyta munarqa.
I didn’t want to be good either.	Ñoqapas manan allin kayta munarqanichu.
I couldn’t wait.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu.
I knew it would happen again.	Yacharqanim hukmanta chayna kananta.
Many weren’t there	Achka mana chaypichu karqa
I can't really comment right now	Kunanqa manam chiqaptachu rimayta atiyman
He’s not alone.	Manam sapallanchu.
Being sick is not a good thing.	Unqusqa kayqa mana allinchu.
I am very proud of what we did.	Anchatam orgulloso kani ruwasqaykumanta.
I couldn’t say anything	Manam imatapas rimayta atirqanichu
You know this summer has been the hardest.	Yachanki kay verano aswan sasa kasqanmanta.
I didn’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu
Everything here is really nice.	Kaypi tukuy imapas chiqap sumaqmi.
Now I want it here	Kunanqa kaypim munani
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
He didn’t need to take it.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu chayta hap’iyta.
I never noticed, but he was right	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu, ichaqa allintam nirqa
For a while I thought he did	Huk tiempon chayta ruwasqanmanta yuyaykurqani
Otherwise not so much.	Mana chayqa mana anchatachu.
I couldn't find a solution.	Manam huk allichayta tariyta atirqanichu.
I knew he was with us	Yacharqanim ñuqaykuwan kasqanmanta
Everything happened so fast.	Tukuy imapas chayna utqayllam pasarqa.
What happened next was here.	Imataq chaymanta kasqa kaypi karqa.
Very, very cold.	Ancha, ancha chiri.
I know what works for me	Yachanim imakuna ñuqapaq allin kasqanmanta
A man can be very great.	Huk runaqa ancha hatunmi kanman.
He had no choice but to do nothing.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, aswanpas manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I feel so guilty here	Kaypiqa anchatam huchayoq sientekuni
I didn’t know you said that	Manam yacharqanichu chayna nisqaykita
But it was in a hurry.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kasharqan.
It wouldn’t be that difficult.	Manan chay hina sasachu kanman.
I’ll make the coffee	Chay kukata ruwasaq
Yes he was.	Arí payqa karqan.
Everything is amazing.	Tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi.
That is not true today.	Chayqa manan kunan tiempopiqa cheqaqchu.
I knew how tired he was	Yacharqanim imayna sayk’usqa kasqanmanta
I would make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwayman karqa
Go do better human things.	Riy aswan allin runa ruwaykunata ruway.
I don’t feel right	Mana allintachu sientekuni
They are all good.	Llapallankum allin kanku.
It’s a big deal, he said.	Hatun ruwaymi, nispas nin.
I thought the same as you	Ñoqapas qan hinan yuyaykurqani
Here it goes.	Kaypim rin.
That was a very impressive experience	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa
They were good, hard.	Paykunaqa allin, sinchi karqanku.
You’re fine, now.	Allinmi kanki, kunanqa.
I never thought about this	Manam haykapipas kaypiqa piensarqanichu
I had almost no time now	Kunanqa yaqa manañam tiempoy karqachu
He says it’s great.	Paymi nin ancha allin kasqanta.
I wasn’t sure how he planned to do that	Mana allintachu yacharqani imaynatachus chayta ruwananpaq yuyaykusqanmanta
I never care about that	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa imananpaschu
I wonder how you found out about it.	Tapukuni imaynatataq chaymanta yacharqanki.
But it was a great year.	Ichaqa hatun wata karqan.
I wanted to walk home.	Wasiyman puriyta munarqani.
I thought it was someone	Pipas kasqanmantam piensarqani
Who knows what will come of it.	Pitaq yachan chaymanta imapas hamunanta.
Anything else.	Imamantapas.
I hadn’t heard him say that in years	Achka watañam mana chayna nisqanta uyarirqanichu
That’s why you’re here.	Chayraykum kaypi kachkanki.
One of them isn’t.	Hukninmi mana.
I feel bad here	Kaypiqa mana allintam sientekuni
He really wasn’t good enough for you.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu karqan qanpaq.
Another famous one.	Huk riqsisqa.
But it certainly isn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana.
All that ugly.	Tukuy chay millay.
More than anything else.	Aswan imapas.
I’ll be so out of place here	Kaypiqa chayna mana maypipas kasaq
I really didn’t know about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
Which is the worst part.	Imataq aswan mana allinqa.
That wasn’t the only thing that happened.	Chayna kaptinqa manam chayllachu karqa.
Sure, that’s another thing.	Seguro, chayqa huk ruwaymi.
It’s so easy to make a little difference.	Ancha facilmi huk chikan chikan ruwayqa.
He just started thinking about it	Chayllaraqmi chaypi yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa
I feel so much	Anchatam sientekuni
I've heard this could be true.	Uyarirqanim kayqa chiqap kanman nispa.
I never thought he was alone.	Manam haykapipas sapallan kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
That’s why I’m a better person.	Chayraykum aswan allin runa kani.
I want to play in the world.	Kay pachapi pukllayta munani.
I can’t tell you now	Kunanqa manan willayta atiymanchu
You can’t understand it.	Manan entiendeyta atiwaqchu.
Being beautiful was not going to be easy.	Sumaq kayqa manam facilchu kanan karqa.
I didn’t see it, but it’s there	Manam rikurqanichu, ichaqa chaypim kachkan
I want to deal with it	Chaywanmi atipayta munani
He, he, he.	Pay, pay, pay.
I can’t get away with it	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu
I’m proud to be there.	Orgulloso kani chaypi kasqaymanta.
They seemed to agree with me.	Paykunaqa ñuqawan acuerdopi hinam karqaku.
I had no idea you could play like that	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani chayna pukllayta atisqaykita
I had never heard of such a thing	Manam haykapipas chayna kasqanmantaqa uyarirqanichu
So far, it’s been fine.	Kunankamaqa allinmi kachkan.
It seemed safe.	Seguro hinam rikchakurqa.
I know he means well	Yachanim allinta niyta munan
You are truly alone.	Chiqaptam sapallayki kachkanki.
So, here you are.	Chaymi, kaypi kachkanki.
He never wants to go anywhere or do anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas maymanpas riyta munanchu nitaq imatapas ruwayta munanchu.
I know you’re not mean	Yachanim mana millay kasqaykita
I want to sleep all day	Tukuy punchawmi puñuyta munani
I can do anything.	Tukuy imatam ruwayman.
I thought he would come back	Yuyarqanim kutimunanta
I think he should be happier	Yuyaykuni aswan kusisqa kananta
He seemed to do everything right.	Payqa tukuy imatapas allinta ruwaq hinam karqa.
It was sad but wonderful	Llakikuypaqmi karqa ichaqa sumaqmi karqa
They were certainly there.	Chiqamanta chaypi karqanku.
I didn’t know right away	Manam chayllachu yacharqani
I didn’t know what he was in trouble for	Manam yacharqanichu ima sasachakuypi kasqanmantaqa
Do it now, please.	Kunanmi chayta ruway.
I didn’t want to see him	Manam paytaqa qawayta munarqanichu
All these things.	Tukuy kay imakuna.
I don't know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
He had been in prison for nearly two years.	Payqa yaqa iskay watañam carcelpi karqa.
That is a very important thing today.	Chayqa kunan tiempopiqa ancha allinmi.
That really made him think hard	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sinchita yuyaykurqan
I was talking about something else.	Hukmanta rimaq kani.
It was surprisingly good.	Admirakuypaqmi allin karqa.
The first year.	Ñawpaq wata.
You’ll learn more.	Astawan yachanki.
Famous people.	Riqsisqa runakuna.
However, that will do the trick.	Ichaqa, chaymi allinta ruwanqa.
Not really doing anything.	Mana chiqaptachu imatapas ruwaspa.
Maybe I’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwasaq.
So you be a new person.	Chaymi qamqa musuq runa kay.
Everything was bad.	Lliwmi mana allin karqa.
I want to be sure	Seguro kaytam munani
They’re great about it.	Paykunaqa chaymanta hatun kanku.
There was no reason for him to do that.	Manam imaraykupas chayna ruwanan karqachu.
Yeah, maybe we should.	Arí, ichapas chayta ruwananchik.
I was at a party this evening	Kunan chisi huk fiestapi karqani
He was a big black man.	Payqa hatun yana kasqa.
I’ve seen this misbehavior before	Kay mana allin ruwaytaqa ñawpaqpi rikurqani
That will make it easier for you.	Chayqa aswan facilmi kanqa qanpaq.
I’ve always wanted to talk to you	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi qanwan rimayta munarqani
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Allintam yacharqani ima ruwananta
I was happy he was happy	Kusisqam karqani kusisqa kasqanmanta
He would be a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runam kanman.
I’m a black man.	Yana runam kani.
I don't think this is a good thing.	Manam piensanichu kayqa allin kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t see how it can be	Manam rikunichu imayna kanman chayta
I couldn’t remember his name	Manam sutinta yuyariyta atirqanichu
I couldn’t understand it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan entiendeyta atirqanichu
Yes, it was, it was.	Arí, chayna karqa.
That’s the real you.	Chayqa chiqap qamqa.
I want to be the same	Ñuqapas chayna kaytam munani
It didn’t take long	Manam unaytachu pasarqa
I don’t understand anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa entiendenichu.
They are not good enough.	Paykunaqa manan allinchu kanku.
He did it three times.	Kimsa kutitam chayta ruwarqa.
I thought, today is going to be a good day	Yuyarqanim, kunan punchawqa allin punchawmi kanqa
I don’t remember his name.	Manam sutinta yuyarinichu.
I felt angry and sad	Phiñasqa, llakisqa ima tarikurqani
So it was crazy.	Chaymi loco kasqa.
What he does here is even worse.	Kaypi ruwasqanqa aswan mana allinmi.
I couldn’t speak either	Ñuqapas manam rimayta atirqanichu
I wasn’t, no, I wasn’t.	Ñuqaqa manam karqachu, manam.
I want someone else to do it.	Huk runa ruwananta munani.
I couldn’t let that happen	Manam chay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
Otherwise, it doesn’t exist.	Mana chayqa manan kanchu.
About two hours.	Yaqa iskay hora.
This was a big deal.	Kayqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
He can’t even do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
Who was injured.	Pitaq k’irisqa karqan.
That’s why things look like.	Chayraykum imapas rikchakun.
They were rightly angry.	Paykunaqa allintam phiñasqa karqaku.
Perhaps most importantly.	Ichapas aswan allinqa.
I’ve been with someone before	Ñawpaqtaqa piwanpas karqani
Beauty is a good thing	Sumaq kayqa allinmi
I was a very tough guy	Ñuqaqa ancha sinchi runam karqani
They were nothing like this.	Paykunaqa manan imapas kay hinachu karqanku.
That thing is there.	Chay imapas chaypim kachkan.
Nothing is true.	Manan imapas cheqaqchu.
I really want to	Chiqaptam munani
I want to remember that.	Chayta yuyariyta munani.
I was really, really disappointed	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta hukmanyasqa karqani
That’s the first thing.	Chayqa ñawpaqtaqa.
I didn’t want to think about it anymore	Manañam yuyaymanayta munarqanichu
I really wanted to catch it	Anchatam hapiyta munarqani
But that one the other day was great.	Ichaqa chay huknin huk punchawqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It could have been something else.	Huk imapas kanman karqan.
How did this thing happen.	Imaynataq kay imapas pasarqa.
Every person.	Sapa runa.
I couldn't do it again	Manañam hukmanta ruwayta atirqanichu
I would talk to him later	Qhepamanmi paywan rimaq kani
I didn’t see him, here, either	Manam paytaqa rikurqanichu, kaypi, nitaq
He barely looked at her.	Payqa yaqapaschá qhawarirqan.
I don’t want to think twice about it	Manam munanichu iskay kutita yuyaymanayta
I think about the house.	Wasipi yuyaykuni.
All that kind of stuff.	Tukuy chay laya imakuna.
Another fact this time	Huk chiqap kay kutipi
That said, he was really great here.	Chayta nispa, payqa chiqaptam kaypi ancha hatun karqa.
But no one has done that today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It was a human child.	Runa wawa kasqa.
Very good, yes.	Ancha allinmi, arí.
He’s good enough for me.	Payqa allinmi ñuqapaq.
Maybe a few.	Ichapas huk iskay kimsa.
You’ll do so much better.	Ancha aswan allinta ruwanki.
And here’s the best part.	Hinaspa kaypi aswan allin kaq.
There, he said.	Chaypi, nispas nisqa.
This man meant everything to her.	Kay runaqa tukuy imatam paypaq niyta munarqa.
And there it is today.	Hinaspa chaypi kunan punchaw kachkan.
I’m not going anywhere	Manam maymanpas risaqchu
I can’t tell anyone	Manam pimanpas willayta atiymanchu
I have a better idea	Aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kani
I know you want to be alone	Yachanim sapallayki kayta munasqaykita
And twice as fast.	Hinaspa iskay kuti aswan utqaylla.
I knew he was there for me	Yacharqanim ñuqapaq chaypi kasqanmanta
I didn’t always know this	Manam sapa kutichu kayta yacharqani
It doesn’t seem right.	Mana allinmi rikchakun.
I mean, everybody knows that	Niyta munani, chaytaqa llapa runam yachanku
I am the lowest of the low	Ñoqaqa aswan pisi kaqmi kani
It didn't matter if it was bad.	Mana allin kaptinqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
Everything is right there.	Tukuy imapas chayllam kachkan.
He’s very tired now.	Kunanqa ancha sayk’usqañan kashan.
I mean, a year ago nobody wanted him.	Niyta munani, huk wata ñawpaqtaqa manam pipas paytaqa munarqanchu.
I can't focus on this right now	Kunanqa manam kaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
He’s more.	Pay astawan.
She says she’s very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi nispas nin.
Now this is really bad.	Kunanqa kayqa chiqap mana allinmi.
I had no idea what had happened	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imapas pasasqanmanta
I know it is not such an easy thing to do	Yachanim mana chayna facil ruway kasqanmanta
Go to his house.	Wasinman riy.
He did it entirely alone.	Payqa llapanpim sapallan ruwarqa.
So often this is true.	Chaymi sapa kuti kayqa chiqap.
I can barely speak	Yaqapaschá manaña rimayta atinichu
I’m sorry for what I did wrong	Mana allin ruwasqaymanta llakikuni
Nothing looked familiar.	Mana imapas riqsisqa hinachu rikchakurqa.
That was maybe, maybe, the right thing to do.	Chayqa ichapas, ichapas, allin ruway karqa.
I want him again	Hukmanta payta munani
There was good practice there.	Chaypiqa allin ruwaymi karqa.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do	Ichapas chayna allin kanman
I know you won't	Yachanim mana chayta ruwanaykipaq
I didn’t want to do it	Manam ruwayta munarqanichu
I do this once or twice a day	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi huk kutita iskay kutita ruwani
I have never been so happy	Manam haykapipas chayna kusisqachu karqani
Event.	Ruwana.
Go be human.	Riy runa kay.
Very realistic.	Ancha chiqap kaq.
I don't have any more time now.	Kunanqa manañam aswan tiempoy kanchu.
I think better than anyone expected	Pipas suyasqanmanta aswan allintam piensani
I can’t say why it’s so great, but it’s great.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imanasqa ancha hatun kasqanmanta, ichaqa ancha hatunmi.
But tonight, something was wrong.	Ichaqa kunan tutam, imapas mana allinchu karqa.
But I can’t believe he did this	Ichaqa manan creeyta atiymanchu kayta ruwasqanmanta
One day it will be there.	Huk punchawmi chaypi kanqa.
I was happy to have him	Kusisqam karqani paywan kasqaymanta
But doing so will be difficult.	Ichaqa chayta ruwaymi sasa kanqa.
I couldn’t remember	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
If something goes wrong.	Imapas mana allin kaptinqa.
I still am, actually	Hinallam kachkani, chiqaptaqa
I wasn’t happy	Manam kusisqachu tarikurqani
I'm not sure it's true	Manam segurochu kani chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I really hope you like it	Chiqamanta suyachkani chayta munasqaykita
Whatever you have to do.	Ima ruwanayki kaptinpas.
Go to another city.	Huk llaqtaman riy.
I didn’t have the time	Manam tiempoy karqachu
Thank you thank you thank you.	Gracias gracias gracias gracias.
Didn’t see that coming.	Mana chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
I think he was really scared	Yuyaykuni chiqaptapuni manchakusqanmanta
I knew this was probably not going right anywhere	Yacharqanim kayqa manapaschá maymanpas allinchu karqa
And this man was a teacher.	Hinaspa kay runaqa yachachiq kasqa.
There is no innocence.	Manam mana huchayoq kayqa kanchu.
I think it will be just that	Chaylla kanqa nispaymi piensani
Every other day for three weeks.	Sapa iskay punchawmi kimsa semana.
That was very recent.	Chayqa ancha chayllaraqmi karqa.
I thought he was very good	Payqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I knew it wasn't him	Yacharqanim mana pay kasqanmanta
I don’t feel that way	Manam chaynatachu sientekuni
He doesn't care that he got caught.	Payqa manam imananpaschu hapisqa kasqanmantaqa.
He knew that might not help.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayqa manapaschá yanapananta.
I feel better now, really	Kunanqa allintam tarikuni, chiqaptapuni
That is a daily routine.	Chayqa sapa punchaw ruwaymi.
I couldn't answer that.	Chaytaqa manam kutichiyta atirqanichu.
I have to hurry up.	Usqhaylla ruwanay tiyan.
I never thought about it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypiqa yuyaykurqanichu.
He’s a teenager now.	Payqa kunanqa wayna sipasmi.
Actually, I never did.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
I had no idea what he was going to do	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima ruwananmanta
He had things to do.	Payqa imakuna ruwanan karqan.
I may have to do something about it	Chaypaqqa ichapas imatapas ruwanay kanqa
I couldn’t tell where they really were or not	Manam yachayta atirqanichu maypi chiqap kasqankuta utaq mana kasqankuta
I felt very happy	Sinchi kusisqan tarikurqani
I told her everything would be fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispaymi nirqani
I know that's who he is	Chayqa pi kasqanmantam yachani
This is what you want.	Kaymi imakuna munasqayki.
I can never say his name	Manam haykapipas sutinta rimayta atiymanchu
I want to get out of here	Kaymanta lluqsiyta munani
I feel like a terrible person	Manchay runa hinam tarikuni
I’ve heard it many times	Achka kutitam uyarirqani
Here it was found.	Kaypim tarikurqa.
I am very happy with it	Ancha kusisqam kachkani
But that is not the case at all.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu ni imapipas.
It was really hard for me.	Chiqamanta sasa karqa ñuqapaq.
I still wasn't sure what he wanted	Hinallam mana segurochu karqani ima munasqanmanta
I was a good teacher	Ñoqaqa allin yachachiqmi karqani
It’s not good anymore.	Manaña allinchu.
Then the next, then the next.	Chaymanta qatiqnin, chaymanta qatiqnin.
It was a great achievement.	Hatun ruwaymi karqan.
A wonderful hour and a half	Huk sumaq hora kuskan
I couldn't think about it	Chaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
He got it right.	Payqa allintan chayta hap’irqan.
I sure didn’t plan to do this	Seguro mana kayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
If there is anything else.	Huk imapas kaptinqa.
But for the most part, it was.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim chayna karqa.
I’m the only one there.	Chaypiqa qamllam kachkani.
We need to do better here.	Kaypiqa aswan allintam ruwananchik.
I was ready to do anything	Tukuy imatapas ruwanaypaqmi listo karqani
Yes, and alone.	Arí, hinaspa sapallan.
That’s going to be you.	Chayqa qanmi kanqa.
I can’t think of anywhere	Manam maypi yuyaymanayta atinichu
I knew who they were	Ñoqaqa yacharqanim pikuna kasqankuta
I do, to no avail	Ñuqaqa ruwani, mana imapaqpas
I always thought there would be time	Sapa kutillanmi yuyaykurqani tiempo kananta
He is a very good teacher.	Payqa ancha allin yachachiqmi.
I don't understand the nature of things.	Manam entiendenichu imapas imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Actually, it’s not worth it.	Chiqaptaqa, manam valenchu.
They are very angry.	Paykunaqa sinchitan phiñasqa kashanku.
What is his name?.	¿Imataq sutin?.
She would be beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi kanman.
But not so well.	Ichaqa manan chay hina allintachu.
He was lucky to succeed.	Payqa suerteyoqmi karqan allinta ruwananpaq.
I had to act quickly	Usqhayllan imatapas ruwanay karqan
Like half an hour ago today.	Kunan kuskan hora ñawpaqta hina.
I want to do more	Astawan ruwayta munani
I couldn’t ignore that	Manam chaytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanichu
He is still doing it today.	Kunankamapas chaytam ruwachkan.
It doesn’t matter why.	Manan imananpaschu imarayku.
I want to be someone	Pipas kaytam munani
But he could not convince her that this was true.	Ichaqa manan convencechiyta atirqanchu kayqa cheqaq kasqanmanta.
I couldn't let this go	Kaytaqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu
A few weeks later, he was gone	Iskay kinsa semana qhepamanmi manaña karqanchu
But now he is .	Ichaqa kunanmi payqa .
That may not be the right thing to do.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
But I can’t say that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu
So, so ugly and so, so sad.	Chaymi, chayna millay hinaspa chayna, ancha llakisqa.
I feel better now.	Kunanqa allintam sientekuni.
There was something there with me	Chaypin imapas karqan ñoqawan
That’s certainly not the case here.	Chayqa seguro manan kaypichu kashan.
I can’t say who it is.	Manam niyta atiymanchu pi kasqanmantaqa.
Good for me, but how much.	Allinmi ñuqapaq, ichaqa hayka.
I thought things might be difficult	Yuyarqanim imapas sasa kanman nispa
A wonderful teacher.	Huk sumaq yachachiq.
That looked really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
So you’re the one.	Chaymi kanki.
I just couldn’t see it	Chaylla mana rikuyta atirqanichu
You knew this.	Kaytaqa yacharqanki.
I wanted to tell you first	Ñawpaqtaqa willayta munarqani
I mean you know that	Chaytaqa yachankim niyta munani
I do too, not yet	Ñuqapas ruwani, manaraqmi
I think it came out of that	Yuyaykuni chaymanta lluqsirqa
Everything went very well.	Tukuy imapas ancha allintam rirqa.
I'm not sure how long.	Manam allintachu yachani hayka unayta.
I wasn’t comfortable with that at all	Manam chaywanqa allintachu karqani ni imapipas
This may not be so good.	Kayqa manapaschá chayna allinchu kanman.
I can really do this job.	Chiqaptam kay llamkayta ruwayta atiyman.
It looks really nice.	Chiqaptam sumaq rikchakun.
I wasn’t excited to drive home	Manam kusisqachu karqani wasiyman carropi rinaypaq
The second did just that.	Iskay kaqmi chayta ruwarqa.
It’s more beautiful.	Aswan sumaqmi.
I must have seen something	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikurqani
I have to be out there	Chay hawapi kanay tiyan
They were all so innocent.	Llapallankum chayna mana huchayoq karqaku.
I couldn’t understand him.	Manam paytaqa entiendeyta atirqanichu.
That would be wonderful	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman
I really think it is.	Chiqaptam piensani chayna kasqanmanta.
I want to catch that	Chayta hap’iyta munani
I didn’t see what would happen to you	Manan rikurqanichu imachus qanwan pasananta
Married to her.	Paywan casarasqa.
I know you have to do something interesting.	Yachanim imapas sumaq kaqta ruwanayki kasqanmanta.
I knew he wouldn't come home one night	Yacharqanim huk tuta mana wasinman kutimunanta
I hadn’t thought it would happen yet	Manaraqmi piensarqanichu chayna kananta
I could do this all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kayta ruwayman karqa.
One of them is a child.	Hukninmi wawa.
Very quickly I learned to listen to that wisdom	Ancha utqayllam yacharqani chay yachayta uyariyta
Otherwise, it’s too bad.	Mana chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
It doesn't seem that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu rikchakun.
I agree that he is a good speaker	Allin rimaq kasqanmantam acuerdopi kani
I feel good, actually	Allintam sientekuni, chiqaptaqa
But not this one.	Ichaqa manan kaytaqa.
I know that it is	Yachanim chayna kasqanta
I didn’t have any other idea	Manam huk yuyayniyuqchu karqani
I couldn’t really talk	Manam chiqaptaqa rimayta atirqanichu
I wasn’t good enough	Manam allinchu karqani
I can be there for three days	Kimsa punchawmi chaypi kayman
I’m sorry about that.	Ñuqaqa chaymanta llakikuni.
It won’t be any different.	Manan huk hinachu kanqa.
I thought he was very severely injured	Yuyarqanin ancha sinchi k’irisqa kashasqanmanta
But this is useless.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kayqa.
But that’s not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu chayqa.
I didn’t want to talk about it, either.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu, nitaq.
No one will do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
I'm here.	Kaypim kachkani.
I kept trying to figure nothing out.	Sapa kutim mana imatapas yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
It would be easier if he was there.	Chaypi kaptinqa aswan facilmi kanman.
He wanted to help.	Yanapayta munarqa.
I knew he had something in mind	Yacharqanim imapipas piensasqanmanta
That was a very difficult year for me.	Chayqa anchatam sasa wata karqa ñuqapaq.
Stupid, young, me.	Sonso, wayna, ñuqa.
And, he realized he was hurt.	Hinaspa, payqa repararqanmi k’irisqa.
It wasn't supposed to be that difficult	Manam chayna sasachu kanay karqa
No one can reach it	Manam pipas chayayta atinmanchu
The food that.	Chay mikhuy chay.
I don’t really know what it is like	Manam allintachu yachani imayna kasqanmantaqa
It may not be the best option for you.	Manapaschá aswan allinchu kanman qanpaq.
Very nice indeed!.	Ancha sumaq chiqap!.
I couldn't believe he had just done that	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayllaraq chayta ruwasqanqa
I couldn’t speak or think	Manañam rimayta nitaq yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
Better than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan allin.
I never want to do that	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwaytaqa munanichu
And really like you.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni qam hina.
A new one.	Huk musuq.
I can make him mine	Paytaqa ñuqapa kananpaqmi ruwayta atiyman
This was the most important thing.	Kaymi aswan allinqa karqa.
Would you like to play?.	¿Munawaqchu pukllayta?.
Maybe half the world.	Ichapas kuskan pacha.
It happened today.	Kunan punchawmi pasarqa.
Ten, once.	Chunka, huk kuti.
If you want to hear it.	Uyariyta munaspaqa.
Here, it’s not.	Kaypi, mana.
I can’t hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyariyta atinichu.
A new day.	Musuq punchaw.
This sounds simple.	Kayqa mana sasachu uyarikun.
That was one of the teachers.	Chayqa huknin yachachiqmi karqa.
I thought it was kind of funny.	Ñuqaqa huk laya asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Now I have an idea	Kunanqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani
One girl, however, could not do such a job	Huk sipasmi ichaqa mana chay hina llank’ayta ruwayta atirqanchu
Now for the third time.	Kunanqa kimsa kaq kutipi.
I never thought it would be a baby	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu wawa kanman nispa
The first was the house.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqa wasi.
I knew something was wrong with me.	Yacharqanim ñuqamanta imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I am very, very happy	Ancha ancha kusisqam kachkani
Can't wait for the third.	Mana suyayta atinchu kimsa kaq.
They will be.	Paykunaqa kanqa.
And so on and on again.	Hinaspa chaynata yapamanta yapamanta.
I will agree with that	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kasaq
I wonder if no one thought of this before	Tapukunitaqmi ñawpaqtaqa mana pipas kayta yuyaykusqanmanta
I was me and something else, something more	Ñuqaqa karqani ñuqapas huk imapas, imapas aswan
That is,.	Kaymi,.
I can’t go on with that.	Manam chaywanqa puriyta atiymanchu.
I didn’t want him to leave	Manam payta ripuyta munarqanichu
Maybe he was both.	Ichapas payqa iskayninku karqa.
I have no idea what you mean	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima niyta munasqaykita
I felt safe about it.	Chaymantaqa segurom tarikurqani.
I can’t eat or sleep	Manam mikuyta nitaq puñuyta atinichu
I want him to succeed every time.	Sapa kuti allinta ruwananta munani.
I didn’t know what it was about	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta kasqanmantaqa
I wasn’t the only one who felt that way	Manam ñuqallachu chaynata tarikurqani
He knows where he wants to be.	Maypi kayta munasqanmanta yachan.
There, it’s a good thing.	Chaypiqa, allin ruwaymi.
I actually rode with someone.	Chiqaptam piwanpas carropi rirqani.
But that’s how you learn.	Ichaqa chaynatam yachanki.
I can’t remember his name.	Manam sutinta yuyariyta atinichu.
I felt a sense of panic	Huk mancharisqa hinam tarikurqani
Not sure what you mean by better.	Mana segurochu ima niyta munanki aswan allin nispa.
I tried to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
I can't tell anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam willayta atiymanchu
He really needs to do something about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa imatapas ruwanan.
I had to be the one.	Ñuqa kanan karqa.
No one else can do it like him.	Manan pipas pay hinaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
But, we did it.	Ichaqa, chayta ruwarqayku.
I know, but it works	Yachanim, ichaqa allintam ruwan
Nothing new about this.	Mana imapas musuq kaymanta.
I’m not going anywhere yet.	Manaraqmi maymanpas risaqchu.
Everyone is tired.	Lliwmi sayk'usqa kachkanku.
He is a real person.	Payqa chiqap runam.
I would have done the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwasaq karqa
And then man.	Hinaspa chaymanta runa.
I won’t be able to sleep any other way.	Manam huk hinaqa puñuyta atisaqchu.
How he knew this, he couldn't say.	Imaynatataq kayta yacharqa, mana niyta atirqachu.
They were both of them.	Iskayninkum karqa.
That’s going to be really interesting.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanqa.
Yes, it was early.	Arí, temprano karqan.
I thought it would be good	Allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
I hope this isn’t bad for you	Suyachkani kayqa mana mana allinchu qampaq
I don’t want that to happen	Manam munanichu chayna kananta
I guess I don’t think it should	Ichapas mana chayna kananta yuyanichu
I'll be caught	Hap'isqa kasaq
This guy is sick.	Kay runaqa unqusqa kachkan.
They are usually bad.	Yaqa llapanpim mana allinchu kanku.
I didn’t know any other way to talk to you.	Manam yacharqanichu huk ñanta qanwan rimanaypaq.
I couldn’t wait	Manam suyayta atirqanichu
Some short time.	Wakin pisi pacha.
And he would do it again.	Hinaspa hukmanta chayta ruwanman.
I was very uncomfortable	Ancha mana allinchu karqani
I didn’t go anywhere	Manam maymanpas rirqanichu
I can’t understand what it’s like	Manam entiendeyta atinichu imayna kasqanmanta
I don’t want to find them.	Manam chaykunataqa tariyta munanichu.
I hope you are better now	Suyachkani kunan aswan allin kanaykita
I never wanted all this to happen, you know	Manam haykapipas tukuy kay pasananta munarqanichu, yachanki
And so you know, it’s amazing.	Hinaspa chaymi yachanki, admirakuypaqmi.
It wasn’t very good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
He had to do something	Imatapas ruwanan karqan
That came later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi hamurqan.
A year has passed.	Huk watañam pasarqa.
I can't say exactly when	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman haykapi kasqanmantaqa
I wanted to talk to you first	Ñawpaqtaqa qanwan rimayta munarqani
Still not a big deal.	Hinallam mana hatun ruwaychu.
I would never be good again	Manañam haykapipas allinchu kayman
Funny thing about it.	Asikunapaq hina chaymanta.
He didn't do well here.	Kaypiqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
He wasn’t really mad at her.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu paywan phiñasqa kasharqan.
I did it quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwarqani.
You’re fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kachkanki.
I knew you were going to be alone	Yacharqanim sapallayki kanaykita
I have no idea what’s out there	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna hawapi kasqanmanta
But obviously this is wrong.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana allinchu.
Obviously that won’t happen, but that’s the reality.	Sut’inmi mana chayqa kanqachu, ichaqa chaymi cheqaq kaq.
We all celebrated.	Llapanchismi fiestata ruwarqayku.
But he knew better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan yacharqan.
He was not a happy speaker.	Payqa manan kusisqachu rimaq.
I know it is a big problem	Yachanim hatun sasachakuy kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to know, not really.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu, manam chiqaptachu.
I just wasn’t sure where it was	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani maypi kasqanmanta
I never realized that.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa repararqanichu.
I hope so, anyway.	Suyachkani, imayna kaptinpas.
I didn’t think he would	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayta ruwananmanta
There are two types.	Iskay laya kan.
Tell me if this makes sense.	Willaway kayqa imapaqpas valenchu ​​icha manachu chayta.
The man is afraid	Runaqa manchakunmi
Please be that great.	Ama hina kaspa, chay hina hatun kay.
I really didn’t want to be that person.	Chiqaptaqa manam chay runa kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I really did, several times	Chiqaptam ruwarqani, achka kutita
I want to tell you that	Chay willayta munani
I know who he is now	Yachanim kunan pi kasqanmanta
This turned out great.	Kayqa ancha allinmi lluqsirqa.
I just went with it	Chayllaraqmi chaywanqa rirqani
He didn’t know where they were.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
He had to do what he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa ruwanan karqan.
I never knew that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanichu
You’re better than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanki.
There is nothing here.	Manam imapas kaypichu kachkan.
I’ve heard it for a long time.	Unayñam uyarirqani.
I just don’t feel comfortable	Manapaschá allintachu tarikuni
I know why you are here	Yachanim imanasqa kaypi kasqaykita
He asked me what he could do for me.	Paymi tapuwarqa imataq ñuqapaq ruway atisqanmanta.
This would be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanman.
I’ll be together soon	Pisi tiempollamantan kuska kasaq
I have done this a few times.	Kaytaqa iskay kimsa kutitam ruwarqani.
I want to tell you about something	Imamantapas willayta munani
I was almost there anyway	Imayna kaptinpas yaqa chaypim karqani
It was a remarkable experience.	Admirakuypaqmi chayna karqa.
I didn’t know what it could be, at the time.	Manam yacharqanichu ima kanman chayta, chay tiempopi.
A chance to do well again	Allinta yapamanta ruwanapaq chansa
I knew better than this	Kaymantaqa aswan allintam yacharqani
I was worried this was going to be a problem today	Llakisqa karqani kunan punchaw kayqa sasachakuy kananmanta
That’s where he wants to be.	Chayqa maypichus kayta munan.
I knew what was going to happen.	Yacharqanim imakuna pasananta.
I think he’s been there before	Yuyaykuni ñawpaqta chaypi kasqanmanta
I can't get a job.	Manam llamkayta tariyta atiymanchu.
I have trouble with that.	Chaywanmi sasachakuypi tarikuni.
Speaking of, I’m here tonight.	Rimaq, kunan tuta kaypi kasqaymanta.
But what he did was remarkable.	Ichaqa chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Still, he couldn't.	Chayna kaptinpas, payqa manam atirqachu.
Actually, it’s worse.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan mana allinmi.
Something he never does.	Imapas mana hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
I really hope you do	Chiqamanta suyachkani chayta ruwanaykipaq
Maybe I can do this	Ichapas kayta ruwayta atiyman
But no, you’re too good.	Ichaqa manan, nishuta allinmi kanki.
Now if this sounds familiar, it must be.	Kunanqa sichus kay riqsisqa uyarikun chayqa, kanan tiyan.
Ten years later.	Chunka wata qhepamanmi.
No one thinks about that.	Chaytaqa manan pipas yuyaykunchu.
He’s the one who did these things.	Paymi chaykunataqa ruwarqa.
I've had him for a long time.	Unayñam payta hapini.
I didn’t hear it	Manam uyarirqanichu
I thought something was wrong	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I really can’t wait.	Chiqaptaqa manam suyayta atinichu.
I didn’t want to do this	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu
But he certainly is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin payqa.
It’s not worth it	Manam imapaqpas valenchu
That’s why we’re happy.	Chayraykum kusisqa kachkaniku.
I think he wanted to talk privately	Yuyaykuni sapallan rimayta munasqanmanta
The process is very interesting.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi.
He said he didn't seem happy.	Paymi nirqa mana kusisqachu hina kasqanmanta.
I had no idea it was so late	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna tarde kasqanmanta
I knew who he was.	Yacharqanim pi kasqanmanta.
Do this the night before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaq tutan ruway.
I knew they were good people	Yacharqanim allin runakuna kasqankuta
I didn’t know what it was going to be like	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kananta
I thought he was in prison	Carcelpi kasqanmantam piensarqani
I didn’t realize it was that big	Manam repararqanichu chayna hatun kasqanmanta
I thought he was very good, and very smart	Ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani, hinaspa ancha yachaysapa kasqanmanta
It’s probably that good.	Yaqapaschá chayna allin.
I haven't known him in a very long time	Ancha unayñam mana paytaqa riqsinichu
Here are the reasons why.	Kaypim kachkan imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa mana allinchu.
After all, we are smart now.	Tukuy imamanta, kunanqa yachaysapa kanchik.
And he was still, just like that.	Hinaspa payqa hinallam karqa, chayna hinallam.
They were injured.	Paykunaqa k’irisqa karqanku.
I didn’t know it was you	Manam yacharqanichu qam kasqaykita
I just couldn’t believe it	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu
I couldn’t eat anything	Manam imatapas mikuyta atirqanichu
I didn’t know what this guy was doing	Manam yacharqanichu kay runa ima ruwasqanmanta
You’re not up to it yet.	Manaraqmi chayman hinachu kanki.
He was probably there.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaypi kasharqan.
Learn something about me.	Ñoqamanta imatapas yachay.
I couldn’t sit still	Manam tiyayta atirqanichu
I’m so tired, soon it will be morning	Ancha sayk’usqañan kashani, pisi tiempollamantan paqarin kanqa
I can't be too sure	Manam anchatachu seguro kayman
That’s probably about me.	Chayqa yaqapaschá ñuqamanta.
We’re fine there.	Chaypiqa allinmi kayku.
I didn’t see much of anyone.	Manam anchatachu pitapas rikurqani.
A guy like me living there, that’s something	Chaypi tiyaq ñuqa hina wayna, chayqa imapas
All this is not so simple.	Tukuy kaykunaqa manam chayna facilchu.
It was really interesting.	Chiqaptam ancha sumaq karqa.
It shouldn’t be a good thing.	Manan allinchu kanan.
I can't believe you're here	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqaykita
He doesn’t want money.	Payqa qolqetan mana munanchu.
Maybe this, maybe that.	Ichapas kay, ichapas chay.
But he usually has to do other things.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim huk ruwaykunata ruwanan.
Maybe I don’t need one	Ichapas mana hukta necesitasaqchu
It’s actually pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi.
That's not ready yet.	Chayqa manaraqmi listochu kachkan.
I wonder what it is.	Tapukuni imatataq.
I didn't feel as tired	Manam chayna sayk'usqa hinachu tarikurqani
That’s what they want.	Chaytan paykunaqa munanku.
Please don’t do it.	Ama hina kaspa, ama ruwaychu.
I desperately wanted to sleep	Sinchitan puñuyta munarqani
I can't talk to you about this	Kaymantaqa manam qamwan rimayta atisaqchu
I really want to know why	Chiqaptam yachayta munani imanasqa kasqanmanta
What a great guy.	Ima hatun runa.
Today was a great day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I thought he was the nicest person.	Paymi aswan sumaq runa kananpaq yuyaykurqani.
There was something else.	Huk imapas karqa.
I know how to fix this.	Kayta allichayta yachani.
I probably won’t do that though.	Manachá chayta ruwasaqchu ichaqa.
You really don’t want to be out there.	Chiqamanta mana chaymanta hawapi kayta munankichu.
He was never there.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypichu karqan.
He couldn’t see it himself.	Mana kikin rikuyta atirqachu.
I suspect he had an idea	Sospechani huk yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I knew how frustrated he was	Yacharqanim imayna hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
As always, he does it anyway.	Sapa kuti hinam imayna kaptinpas ruwan.
I won’t be able to help it	Manam yanapayta atisaqchu
So he opened it.	Chaymi kicharirqa.
I couldn’t look at it anymore	Manañam qawayta atirqanichu
Why, no one knows.	Imarayku, mana pipas yachanchu.
Hope you never do that.	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas chayta ruwanaykita.
I never knew that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yacharqanichu
He was a pretty big guy.	Payqa sumaq hatun runam karqa.
I know exactly where it is	Allintam yachani maypi kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to go to a party	Manam fiestaman riyta munarqanichu
I didn’t want that.	Manam munarqanichu chaytaqa.
But this is the worst part.	Ichaqa kaymi aswan mana allinqa.
This one was the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
That statement is not appropriate.	Chay rimayqa manam allinchu.
The bad is not the good.	Mana allinqa manam allinchu.
I didn’t want to play anymore	Manañam pukllayta munarqanichu
I just can’t see it.	Chaylla mana rikuyta atinichu.
I know you want him	Yachanim payta munasqaykita
I knew what he could do.	Yacharqanim ima ruway atisqanmanta.
I think everybody’s happy.	Tukuy runa kusisqa kasqankuta yuyani.
I was very depressed	Anchatam llakisqa tarikurqani
I didn’t mean that	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu
I wonder if he’s alone	Sapallanchu kasqanmanta tapukuni
I just wanted to make sure	Chayllam seguro kayta munarqani
I had no idea it was a kid	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani huk wawa kasqanmanta
Not getting caught doing it isn’t.	Mana hap’isqa kay ruwaspa manan.
I haven’t heard that in quite some time	Allin unayñan mana chayta uyarirqanichu
I couldn’t figure out what was going on	Manam imakuna pasasqanmantaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I wasn’t that excited	Manam chayna kusisqachu karqani
Me, I don’t want to do that.	Ñuqa, mana chayta ruwayta munanichu.
I know you know this	Ñoqaqa yachanin kayta yachasqaykita
I wasn’t always sure he could do it	Manam sapa kutichu seguro karqani chay ruway atisqanmanta
He is sure of it.	Payqa segurom kachkan.
I just didn’t think about it before	Chayllaraqmi ñawpaqtaqa mana yuyaykurqanichu
I wonder what it is about me that causes it.	Tapukuni imataq ñuqamanta chayta ruwan.
I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.	Manam ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
This, he knew, would be the worst.	Kayqa, yacharqanmi, aswan mana allin kananta.
I wasn't supposed to be here.	Manam kaypichu kanay karqa.
I think he knows everything.	Yuyaykuni tukuy imata yachan.
I need to be a better person	Aswan allin runa kaytam necesitasaq
I didn’t realize this was there	Manam repararqanichu kayqa chaypi kasqanmantaqa
I thought it would be good sometimes.	Yuyarqanim wakin kutipi allin kananta.
I didn’t really think so	Manam chiqaptaqa chaynataqa piensarqanichu
I plan to do this every month	Sapa killa kayta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykuni
This was the reason why.	Kaymi karqan imarayku.
I didn’t want to tell anything about myself	Manam ñuqamanta imatapas willayta munarqanichu
Like, really good.	Imayna, chiqap allin.
That can be difficult.	Chayqa sasa kanman.
I wonder if that means anything	Chayqa imatapas niyta munanchu icha manachu chayta tapukuni
Obviously, that was no longer true.	Sut’inmi, chayqa manañan cheqaqchu karqan.
Morning, night.	Paqarin, tuta.
Not sure about this.	Mana segurochu kaymanta.
The kid who was always me.	Chay wawa, paymi sapa kuti ñuqa karqani.
I found out a week ago.	Huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani.
I’m not sure if it’s right or wrong.	Manam allintachu yachani sichus allintachu icha manachu.
I am much better now	Kunanqa aswan allinmi kani
I didn’t want to ask at first	Ñawpaqtaqa manam tapuyta munarqanichu
If you want to buy it.	Sichus rantiyta munanki chayqa.
But I wanted to.	Ichaqa munarqani.
It couldn’t be better.	Mana aswan allinchu kanman.
I have seen worse.	Aswan mana allintam rikurqani.
I have always tried	Sapa kutim kallpanchakurqani
I can’t wait any longer.	Manañam suyayta atinichu.
They are very tough.	Paykunaqa ancha sinchi kanku.
But he could see nothing.	Ichaqa manan imatapas rikuyta atirqanchu.
I can’t let that go	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atiymanchu
But you are, okay.	Ichaqa qanmi, allinmi.
I had an amazing year	Admirakuypaqmi wata karqani
We are happy about that.	Chaymantam kusisqa kachkaniku.
I couldn't help but look at it	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu mana qawayta
Today is a new day.	Kunan punchawmi musuq punchaw.
I barely remember him	Paytaqa yaqapaschá mana yuyarinichu
I didn’t know what he knew	Manam yacharqanichu ima yachasqanmanta
Everything was strangely familiar.	Tukuy imapas mana riqsisqa hinam riqsisqa karqa.
But so far it hasn’t worked out	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan
I’m the one.	Ñuqaqa chay.
If ever, certainly not.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas, cheqaqtapunin manaña.
Everything about him, really.	Tukuy ima paymanta, chiqaptapuni.
I repeated the process several times	Chay ruwaytaqa askha kutitan yapamanta ruwarqani
I don’t have the time	Manam tiempoy kanchu
He was probably injured.	Payqa yaqapaschá k’irisqa karqan.
He was supposed to be here.	Payqa kaypim kanan karqa.
The process is .	Chay ruwayqa .
So he asked me to do the job.	Chaymi chay llamkayta ruwanaypaq niwarqa.
I so didn’t mean that	Ñuqaqa chaymi mana chaynatachu niyta munarqani
But he said he was terrified.	Ichaqa llumpay mancharisqa kasqanmantam nirqa.
He left that whole thing there.	Chay tukuy imata chaypi saqirqa.
I didn’t know anyone was out there	Manam yacharqanichu pipas hawapi kasqanmanta
I knew early on that he wasn’t going with anyone	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani mana piwanpas risqanmanta
For some reason he felt nervous and anxious.	Imaraykupas mancharisqa, llakisqa ima tarikurqa.
There he goes.	Chaypim rin.
I thought it would be funny.	Asikunapaq hina kananta yuyaykurqani.
The man is a real player.	Chay runaqa chiqap pukllaqmi.
I couldn’t believe they were gone	Manam creeyta atirqanichu manaña kasqankuta
I still can't see anyone	Kunankamapas manam pitapas rikuyta atinichu
And the second one.	Hinaspa iskay kaq.
And now here we are.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi kachkaniku.
I can’t imagine what’s wrong	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa
There was no point in talking about it further.	Manam imapaqpas karqachu chaymanta astawan rimayqa.
You want to be ready to go.	Rinanpaq listo kayta munanki.
I'm looking forward to it!	¡Anchatam suyachkani!
I didn’t hear anything from him	Paytaqa manan imatapas uyarirqanichu
I never know what it is or isn't	Manam haykapipas yachanichu imataq chay utaq mana chayqa
I love him so much.	Paytaqa anchatam munani.
But if anyone wants to help that’s nice.	Ichaqa sichus pipas yanapayta munan chayqa chayqa sumaqmi.
But he thought it would be too late tomorrow.	Ichaqa paqarinmi ancha tarde kananta yuyaykurqan.
I know you're tired	Yachanim sayk'usqa kasqaykita
I couldn’t help but feel happy.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu, kusisqam tarikurqani.
Not much there.	Mana ancha chaypichu.
I know, it makes no sense	Yachanim, manam imapaqpas valenchu
This was ridiculous	Kayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa
I've been there several times recently	Chayllaraqmi achka kutita chayman rirqani
I am really doing this for you	Chiqaptam kayta ruwachkani qampaq
But I don’t know how to say it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna niyta.
He has to do it the way he wants to.	Payqa imayna munasqanman hinam ruwanan.
It totally failed him.	Chayqa paytaqa llapanpim mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Like a hidden child.	Pakasqa kaq wawa hina.
I can't stand this anymore	Manañam kayta aguantayta atiymanchu
There’s a second day and a second hour.	Iskay kaq p’unchay, iskay kaq hora ima kan.
Could not get this job.	Mana kay llamk'ayta tariyta atirqachu.
I have no control over what happened in the past	Ñawpaqpi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu
Many people were injured	Achka runakunam k’irisqa karqaku
I knew why he wanted the story	Yacharqanim imanasqa chay willakuyta munasqanmanta
But I didn’t really know	Ichaqa manan allintachu yacharqani
I never knew his name	Manam haykapipas sutinta yacharqanichu
I could say a lot more	Aswan achkatam niyta atiyman
But then some people, okay.	Ichaqa chaymanta wakin runakuna, allinmi.
No, he didn’t just want to do it.	Manan, manan chayllachu ruwayta munarqan.
I never expected it to happen	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu chayna kananta
I really think he did	Chiqaptam piensani chayna ruwasqanmanta
Describe the experience.	Willay imachus pasasqanmanta.
But something was definitely wrong.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin imapas mana allinchu karqan.
According to this,.	Kayman hinaqa,...
This should be done quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwana.
You’re the bad guy.	Qam chay millay runa.
I'm sorry, he says.	Pampachaykuway, ninmi.
I just didn’t have time.	Chaylla mana tiempoy karqanchu.
I wasn’t there, not anymore	Manam chaypichu karqani, manañam
The first is the	Ñawpaq kaq.
You are not a human being.	Manam runachu kanki.
This much he knows.	Kay achkatam payqa yachan.
I think that was his name	Chayqa sutinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
He is there with her.	Payqa chaypim kachkan paywan.
I know that he will	Ñoqaqa yachanin chayta ruwananta
It wouldn’t be easy, the man said.	Mana facilchu kanman, nispas nin chay runaqa.
It was a strong one.	Sinchi karqan.
I couldn’t believe he said yes	Manam creeyta atirqanichu arí nisqanta
I’m not the only one who does this.	Manam ñuqallachu kayta ruwani.
I mean, all the time	Niyta munani, tukuy pacha
There was a snowstorm.	Chaypi kasqa.
But there would soon be a problem.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan huk sasachakuy kanman karqan.
I think you’re ready	Ñoqaqa yuyaykuni listoña kasqaykita
Would love to see him do really well.	Munayman chiqap allinta ruwananta qawayta.
I really didn’t want to talk to anyone	Chiqaptaqa manam piwanpas rimayta munarqanichu
No, they weren’t good.	Manan, manan allinchu karqanku.
An hour or two maybe	Huk iskay hora ichapas
Great, you think.	Hatun, yuyanki.
Now you are here.	Kunanqa kaypim kachkanki.
He is happy to be himself.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan kikin kasqanmanta.
Maybe it was never meant to be.	Ichapas mana haykapipas chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
He couldn’t wait.	Payqa manan suyayta atirqanchu.
A terrible one, there	Huk manchay, chaypi
Obviously that means something	Sut’inmi chayqa imatapas niyta munan
And this week, it came out here.	Hinaspa kay semanapi, kayman lluqsirqa.
In fact, there was nothing	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas karqachu
I know you know the truth	Yachanim cheqaq kaqta yachasqaykita
I couldn’t reach it anymore.	Manañam chayayta atirqanichu.
I actually feel so much better now	Chiqaptaqa kunanqa ancha allintam tarikuni
You don't know what it was like back then.	Chay tiempopi imayna kasqanmantaqa manam yachankichu.
I think tomorrow.	Yuyaykuni paqarin.
A man like him	Pay hina runa
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
He never said that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa nirqanchu.
I was a great teacher	Huk hatun yachachiqmi karqani
And then you do it again, again and again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta ruwanki, yapamanta yapamanta.
It always takes time.	Sapa kutim tiempota necesitan.
I couldn’t walk anymore	Manañam puriyta atirqanichu
I hope you won't be there.	Suyachkani mana chaypi kanaykita.
Go, go.	Riy, riy.
I just can’t give up	Chaylla mana saqiyta atiymanchu
I really wanted them	Chaykunataqa anchatam munarqani
However, the reason for this is very simple.	Ichaqa, imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa ancha facilmi.
I didn’t realize how hard this was	Manam repararqanichu kayqa ancha sasa kasqanmanta
I didn't know what he looked like	Manam yacharqanichu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta
I just have to be me	Ñuqaqa ñuqallam kanay
Very strong thing.	Ancha sinchi kaq.
Perhaps he was right.	Yaqapaschá payqa allinta rimarqan.
He was one of them, actually.	Payqa hukninmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
He just doesn’t do it.	Payqa mana hinallam ruwan.
I didn’t want to sit there	Manam chaypi tiyayta munarqanichu
I really thought that would have been a good thing to do.	Chiqamanta piensarqani chay ruway allin kanman karqa.
There is no other way to do it.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanchu.
No past, no future.	Mana ñawpaq, mana hamuq pacha.
I can’t say for sure	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman
I think he is a good man.	Allin runa kasqanmantam piensani.
I will never do that	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwasaqchu
I had to be ahead of time	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi kanay karqa
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas riqsinichu.
I was scared and worried	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima karqani
But he still did well.	Ichaqa hinallam allinta ruwarqa.
I could be out there doing something	Chay hawapi imatapas ruwaspa kayta atiyman
I mean seriously, as a person	Serio niyta munani, runa hina
There is the world.	Chaypin kashan kay pacha.
I just didn’t know how	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynatachus chayta
I never heard from him again	Manañam haykapipas paymanta uyarirqanichu
I agree, he is doing great	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani, payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan
I didn’t know how to ignore that	Manam yacharqanichu chayta mana uyariyta
I'm sure it's good.	Seguro kani allin kasqanmanta.
But you are there now.	Ichaqa kunanmi chaypi kanki.
He was a man who got things done, who did great things.	Payqa huk runam karqa imakunatapas ruwaq, hatun ruwaykunata ruwaq.
Not today, anyway.	Mana kunan punchawchu, imayna kaptinpas.
I don’t want to do that	Chay ruwayqa manan munanichu
I’m not going to be that person	Manam chay runachu kasaq
It looked serious.	Serio hinam rikchakurqa.
I really can't answer that now.	Chiqaptaqa manam kunanqa chaytaqa kutichiyta atiymanchu.
The new future.	Musuq hamuq pacha.
This is what he meant.	Kaymi niyta munarqa.
I wasn't there the day before	Ñawpaq p'unchawqa manam chaypichu karqani
I tried to do what was right	Allin kaqta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
I don’t really know how he feels.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna sientekusqanmanta.
At least you can’t.	Aswanpas manan atiwaqchu.
I just didn’t know yet	Chayllaraqmi manaraq yacharqanichu
Perhaps the most important one.	Ichapas aswan importante kaq.
I do this all the time.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwani.
But of course he didn’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
You obviously want to be here.	Sut’inmi kaypi kayta munanki.
That’s what came out.	Chayqa lluqsirqa.
Now we are here.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkaniku.
It was the day.	P’unchaymi karqan.
He was finally home.	Payqa qhepamanmi wasinpi kasharqan.
I know this is a good person	Yachanim kayqa allin runa kasqanmanta
Where he is.	Maypichus payqa kachkan.
But there are many.	Ichaqa kanmi achka.
So, we did it.	Chaymi, ruwarqayku.
We are not sure.	Manam segurochu kanchik.
Sometimes now, at night.	Wakin kuti kunan, tuta.
I love that you want to do this	Kayta ruwayta munasqaykita anchata munani
I feel pretty good.	Allin allintam sientekuni.
I mean that’s a good thing	Chayqa allinmi niyta munani
I really hope you can too	Chiqaptam suyachkani qampas atisqaykita
That was really something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imapas karqan.
He doesn’t know much about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas anchatachu yachan.
It will be very big there.	Chaypiqa ancha hatunmi kanqa.
I just didn’t know where that would be	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu maypi chay kanman chayta
He said he wasn't.	Payqa mana kasqanmantam nirqa.
I really wanted to know what was going on	Ñoqaqa anchatan munarqani imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta
I just didn’t realize what time it was	Chayllaraqmi mana repararqanichu ima hora kasqanmanta
Yes, he certainly would.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
There is no easy way to do it.	Manan facil ruwayqa kanchu.
I knew something was wrong	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
It didn't do a good job.	Mana allintachu llamkayta ruwarqa.
I know what it’s going to be like.	Yachanim imayna kananta.
I can do some time	Huk tiempota ruwayta atiyman
I want you to want to be with me	Ñoqaqa munani ñoqawan kayta munasqaykita
And he was tired.	Hinaspa sayk'usqa kasqa.
I was there the first night	Ñawpaq tutan chaypi karqani
I can’t tell you, not yet	Manam willayta atiymanchu, manaraqmi
Not sure what’s wrong with me.	Mana segurochu imachus ñoqawan kashan chayta.
It must be hidden.	Pakasqa kanan.
I need time.	Tiempotan munani.
I couldn't deal with it anymore	Manañam chaywanqa atipayta atirqanichu
And, he is right.	Hinaspa, payqa allintam rimachkan.
Someone was here.	Pipas kaypi kasqa.
Now I can work with it	Kunanqa chaywanmi llamk’ayta atiyman
I’m good to go.	Allinmi kani rinaypaq.
There had to be a second person there.	Chaypiqa iskay kaq runam kanan karqa.
It was always cold.	Sapa kutim chiri karqa.
I listen to him.	Payta uyarini.
I think a lot of people are	Yuyaykuni achka runakuna chayna kasqankuta
Foolish, foolish young man	Mana yuyayniyuq, mana yuyayniyuq wayna
And this means two things.	Hinaspa kayqa iskay ima niyta munan.
He went well.	Payqa allintam rirqa.
He can never stand it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas aguantayta atinmanchu.
You know you have to.	Yachankim chayta ruwanaykita.
He would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanman.
I have no idea, man, he says.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani, runa, nispas nin.
You probably did what you had to do	Yaqapaschá ruwanayki kaqta ruwarqanki
That’s what you’ll have to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki kanqa.
He couldn't help it.	Payqa manam yanapayta atirqachu.
I couldn't be sure what it was.	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
It never, ever existed.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas karqachu.
They were both sure of it.	Iskayninkum chaymanta seguro karqaku.
I was crazy last night	Qayna tutam loco karqani
That is what he must do.	Chaytan payqa ruwanan.
He was an angry, angry kid.	Payqa phiñasqa, phiñasqa wawa kasqa.
I didn’t expect it to be good	Manam suyarqanichu allin kananta
He didn't look happy.	Payqa manam kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
I thought that was really interesting	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I couldn’t tell him what he was going to do	Manam niyta atirqanichu ima ruwananta
It’s a great thing.	Hatun kaqmi.
He is, however, a black man.	Payqa ichaqa yana runam.
I can’t do that again	Manan hukmanta chayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t really tell anyone	Manam pimanpas chiqaptaqa willayta atirqanichu
And later again.	Hinaspa qhepaman yapamanta.
That’s why you want to.	Chayraykum munanki.
Everything looks so grim.	Tukuy imapas ancha llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
I don’t really need it.	Manam anchatachu necesitasaq.
He was that big of a deal.	Payqa chayna hatunmi karqa.
He was alone, and he knew it.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
That obviously wasn’t the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
That’s how they know it.	Chaynatam yachanku.
I had to do something all the time	Tukuy tiempon imatapas ruwanay karqan
He can’t do anything otherwise	Manan huk hinaqa imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu
I’m the young lady.	Ñuqaqa chay sipasmi kani.
I still have never heard of it	Kunankamapas manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu
I hope to get there one day	Suyachkani huk punchaw chayman chayayta
I think that would be a good thing	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispaymi yuyaykuni
The right thing to do.	Allin kaqta.
So it won’t work for you.	Chaymi mana qampaq allinchu kanqa.
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I wouldn't be here without it	Mana chaywanqa manam kaypichu kayman
He had said that.	Payqa chaytan nisqa.
I want to answer	Kutichiyta munani
I went a bit and it was nice.	Rirqani huk chikan hinaspa sumaq karqa.
One of them thought you were human.	Hukninmi runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqan.
It never makes sense.	Manam haykapipas imapaqpas valenchu.
I really thought there was going to be something	Chiqaptam piensarqani imapas kananta
I thought about that for a while.	Chaypin huk rato yuyaykurqani.
I can’t leave him	Manam paytaqa saqiyta atiymanchu
I feel like there is a second one	Iskay kaq kasqanmantam sientekuni
Maybe she can talk to him about everything that happened.	Ichapas tukuy ima pasasqanmanta paywan rimayta atinman.
I wasn’t so happy anymore	Manañam chayna kusisqachu karqani
And then he went away.	Hinaspa chaymanta rirqa.
And, there was something else.	Hinaspa, huk imapas karqa.
I had no idea what would happen next	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna chaymanta pasananta
I didn’t mean it here but you are now	Manam kaypiqa munarqanichu ichaqa kunanmi kanki
I very much doubt that will happen now	Anchatam iskayrayani kunan chayna kananta
Panic.	Manchay.
I didn’t have much to do	Manam achka ruwanay karqachu
I know this is stupid	Yachanim kayqa sonso kasqanmanta
I still don't see anything.	Kunankamapas manam imatapas rikunichu.
A future with him there	Huk hamuq pacha paywan chaypi
Just recently at home.	Chayllaraqmi wasinpi.
Do that a lot.	Chayta achkata ruway.
He was sure something was wrong.	Payqa segurom karqa imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Whatever the case may be.	Imapas kaptinpas.
I couldn’t let this go anymore	Manañam kayta saqiyta atirqanichu
I just knew something was coming, something big	Chaylla yacharqani imapas hamunanta, imapas hatun
I wanted him to be the villain	Ñuqaqa munarqani chay millay runa kananta
Unlike the others.	Mana wakin hinachu.
But I knew better	Ichaqa aswan allintan yacharqani
There has to be something else to do	Huk ruwaymi kanan
I can't work out why	Manam llamkayta atinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I know he is, for sure	Yachanim pay kasqanmanta, seguro
I just didn’t know how to do it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta
There is a way to do this.	Chaypaqqa kanmi imayna ruwanapaq.
I'll be there or here for a while.	Chaypi utaq kaypi huk rato kasaq.
He looked right once, twice.	Huk kuti, iskay kutita allinta qhawarisqa.
I’m not so sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu seguro kani.
I couldn’t figure out why	Manam yachayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I know he didn't mean it	Yachanim mana chayta niyta munasqanmanta
I can’t go there.	Manam chaymanqa riyta atiymanchu.
I don’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu
I hear that’s the worst part	Uyarini chaymi aswan mana allin kaqta
I wish he was here right now	Munaymanmi kunanpacha kaypi kananta
I wanted to believe it so much	Anchatam creeyta munarqani
If you want to learn more.	Sichus astawan yachayta munanki chayqa.
He will probably come soon.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaylla hamunqa.
I didn't know what he looked like	Manam yacharqanichu imayna rikchayniyuq chay runa kasqanmantaqa
He is here somewhere.	Payqa kaypi maypipas kachkan.
He didn’t have to do that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwanan karqan.
He couldn't go today.	Kunan punchawqa manam riyta atirqachu.
That is, he was an ugly black man.	Chayqa, payqa millay yana runam karqa.
It was probably for the best.	Yaqapaschá allinpaq karqan.
I wish it was just that.	Chaylla kananta munayman.
I couldn’t think of anything else	Manam hukta yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I did this last year.	Kaytaqa qayna wata ruwarqani.
I want everything, you know? 	Tukuy imatam munani, yachankichu?
he says, smirking	nispas nin
So it’s true.	Chaymi chiqap kachkan.
I wouldn’t do that again	Chaytaqa manañan hukmanta ruwaymanchu
He said that's why he's here.	Nisqa chaymi kaypi kasqanmanta.
I think that was a good thing	Chayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
That was really stupid.	Chayqa chiqap sonso kaymi karqa.
I do like every other bad guy	Sapa huk mana allin runa hinam ruwani
But I don’t know how to fix it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna allichayta.
I'm not sure, it just happened so fast	Manam segurochu kani, chayllaraqmi chayna utqaylla pasarqa
Can't seem to stop it.	Mana harkayta atinchu rikchakun.
But this is, no one knew.	Ichaqa kaymi, manan pipas yacharqanchu.
I know what he means.	Yachanim ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I can't believe no one will help	Manam creeyta atinichu mana pipas yanapananta
And that obviously won’t work.	Hinaspa chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu kanqa.
But, that wasn’t the worst part.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu karqan.
I think I should tell you it’s good.	Yuyaykuni allin kasqanmanta willanaypaq.
I want to hear more	Astawan uyariyta munani
I know he was worried	Yachanim llakisqa kasqanmanta
It was a difficult day.	Sasa punchawmi karqa.
I can’t be crazy	Manam loco kayta atiymanchu
I really had nowhere else to go	Chiqaptaqa manam maymanpas rinaypaq karqachu
That was always his.	Chayqa sapa kutim paypaq karqa.
I want to understand very badly	Ancha mana allintam entiendeyta munani
I was unhappy and he knows this	Ñuqaqa mana kusisqachu karqani hinaspa payqa kayta yachan
That’s a bad thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
The reason for this is not yet fully understood.	Imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa manaraqmi allintachu yachanku.
Anywhere but here.	Maypipas mana kaypichu.
I was never very good at it	Manam haykapipas ancha allinchu karqani chaypiqa
I’m waiting for him to come	Suyachkani hamunanta
I am no longer a human being	Manañam runachu kani
I might not be able to talk to him and	Manapaschá paywan rimayta atiymanchu hinaspa
Eventually it was easy.	Qhepamanmi mana sasachu karqan.
I was happy to be around	Ñuqaqa kusisqam tarikurqani
He wanted it, he was there.	Payqa munarqa, chaypim karqa.
He can do it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwayta atinman.
I think you know that	Chayta yachasqaykita yuyani
But it is not at all certain.	Ichaqa manan imapipas segurochu.
He's crazy enough to do it.	Payqa loco hinam chayta ruwananpaq.
I couldn’t get him to do that	Manam chayta ruwananpaqqa atiymanchu karqa
And two at that.	Hinaspa iskay chaypi.
I am so glad he did well.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani allinta ruwasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to be anywhere else.	Manam maypipas kaytaqa munarqanichu.
But that might be a bit much.	Ichaqa chayqa huk chhikantan askha kanman.
I don’t understand the word no.	Manam entiendenichu mana simitaqa.
Do those simple things.	Chay facil ruwaykunata ruway.
And another, another.	Hinaspa hukta, hukta.
It has to be really big	Chiqap hatunmi kanan
He knows how to get there.	Payqa yachanmi imayna chayayta.
We are not very happy	Manam ancha kusisqachu kanchik
I should have been clearer	Aswan sut’inmi kanay karqan
I can’t be that bad to do that	Manam chayna millay kayta atiymanchu chayta ruwanaypaqqa
I’m sure this is a good thing	Seguro kani kayqa allin kasqanmanta
Both are very good.	Iskayninku ancha allin.
He assured me that everything would be fine.	Paymi niwarqa tukuy imapas allin kananmanta.
But that's okay now about that.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi kunan chaymantaqa.
He would want to get home.	Payqa wasinman chayayta munanman karqan.
I think that is very important	Chayqa ancha importante kasqanmantam piensani
No, isn’t that all.	Manan, ¿manachu chaylla.
I don’t know exactly where they are.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqankuta.
Maybe he shouldn't have done that	Ichapas mana chayta ruwananchu karqa
I did that, but not anymore	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manañam
Now he did just that.	Kunanqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
I can cope with that	Chaywanmi aguantayta atiyman
I want to know what you thought in the past	Ñawpaqpi ima yuyaykusqaykita yachayta munani
But he’s great.	Ichaqa payqa hatunmi.
This is about as easy as that.	Kayqa yaqa chayman hina facilmi.
But this moment.	Ichaqa kay rato.
It’s more interesting, he says.	Aswan sumaqmi, nispas nin.
I knew he was serious.	Yacharqanim serio kasqanmanta.
That happened in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa chayna pasarqa.
So that’s what it means.	Chaymi chay niyta munan.
He said he didn't.	Paymi nirqa mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
A married man	Casarasqa runa
Of course, that’s the first thing you learn.	Arí, chaytan ñawpaqtaqa yachanki.
I couldn't focus on this	Kaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I want to know if that’s the case	Chayna kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I think that’s what he would want.	Chaytan payqa munanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
I mean, it’s not good.	Niyta munani, manam allinchu.
I didn’t realize that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa repararqanichu
I didn’t want to go there	Manam chayman riyta munarqanichu
I suspect it is.	Sospechani chayna kasqanmanta.
I have no idea who he is or anything	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani pi kasqanmanta nitaq imamantapas
Soon that would be it.	Pisi tiempollamantan chay kanman karqan.
I was crazy hungry a little while ago	Ñuqaqa huk chikan ñawpaqtaraqmi loco yarqasqa karqani
Everything was wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
Two things happened that day.	Chay punchawmi iskay imapas pasarqa.
I never knew it was that good	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna allin kasqanmantaqa
People want to know more about him.	Runakunaqa paymanta astawan yachayta munanku.
The man did do some really good things.	Chay runaqa cheqaqtapunin wakin cheqaq allin ruwaykunata ruwarqan.
Maybe as good as you.	Ichapas qam hina allin.
Maybe he has a few ideas	Ichapas iskay kimsa yuyayniyuq kanman
He was very happy.	Payqa sinchi kusisqan kasharqan.
I feel good about myself	Allintam sientekuni
But now you’re thinking twice.	Ichaqa kunanmi iskay kutita yuyaykunki.
I loved it so much	Anchatam munarqani
I really want to know who he is	Chiqamanta yachayta munani pi kasqanmanta
I don’t know anything	Manam imatapas yachanichu
I had no idea how to do it	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani imayna ruwanaypaq
But he doesn’t think about it.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu yuyaykun.
I've got it.	Ñuqaqa hap'ini.
You want it to be here.	Kaypi kananta munanki.
I can’t tell you	Manam willayta atiymanchu
And better looking.	Hinaspa aswan allin rikchayniyuq.
I didn't think it was very important	Manam ancha importante kananpaqchu piensarqani
Maybe I won’t do it right.	Ichapas mana allintachu ruwasaq.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
I'd like to come	Munaymanmi hamuyta
Where you want it to be.	Maypichus kananta munanki.
He could never figure that out.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanchu.
That should be there.	Chayqa chaypim kanan.
I didn’t want anyone to know anything	Manam munarqanichu pipas imatapas yachananta
That will be the best.	Chayqa aswan allinqa kanqa.
I thought it was great.	Hatun kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani.
It is very difficult for me to do the work.	Ancha sasam ñuqapaq llamkayta ruwayqa.
It was great to be with him.	Ancha allinmi karqa paywan kayqa.
I’m actually a really big guy	Chiqaptaqa chiqap hatun runam kani
I can get there earlier	Chaymanqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chayayta atiyman
Rather, it is the truth.	Aswanpas cheqaq kaqmi.
I want to be in line with that.	Chayman hina kaytam munani.
He had this great idea of ​​him.	Payqa kay hatun yuyayniyuqmi karqan paymanta.
This is easy to do.	Chaytaqa ruwayqa facilmi.
By now I know what it is.	Kunankamaqa yachanin ima kasqanmanta.
I really want to do more in the future	Chiqamanta hamuq tiempopi astawan ruwayta munani
I was actually excited about it	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam kusisqa karqani
I know what is involved	Yachanim imakuna chaypi kasqanmanta
He knows what comes next.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna qhepaman hamunanta.
Yeah, not much.	Arí, mana anchatachu.
I wanted to be good.	Allin kaytam munarqani.
I can't stand them	Chaykunataqa manam aguantayta atinichu
That's better, actually	Chayqa aswan allinmi, chiqaptaqa
Thank you very much.	Ancha sumaq gracias.
But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atiymanchu.
It would be nice!.	¡Allinmi kanman!.
I was right there too.	Ñuqapas allintam chaypiqa karqani.
I had never seen any of them before	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa rikurqanichu
I can't stand it here	Kaypiqa manam aguantayta atinichu
I've been here a very long time.	Kaypiqa ancha unayñam kachkani.
I didn’t know or care what his name was	Manam yacharqanichu nitaq imananpaschu ima sutin kasqanmantaqa
They were busy.	Paykunaqa ocupasqa karqanku.
Make that journey.	Chay puriyta ruway.
Perhaps one day it will.	Yaqapaschá huk punchaw chayna kanqa.
I know you want the best for me	Yachanim ñuqapaq allin kaqta munasqaykita
It’s very ambiguous.	Ancha iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
So that could be something.	Chaymi chayqa imapas kanman.
The second step is to do something about it.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa chaymanta imatapas ruwaymi.
I still worry about you, you know	Kunankamapas qanmanta llakikuni, yachanki
I want to hear him	Payta uyariyta munani
I couldn’t do anything after that	Chay qhepamanmi mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
That sounds funny saying that	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam uyarikun chayta nispa
I really don't need one	Chiqaptaqa manam hukta necesitasaqchu
Be here now.	Kunan kaypi kay.
I don’t want to talk about the problem.	Manam sasachakuymanta rimayta munanichu.
I just get it right away	Chayllam chayta hapini
In fact, it is.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymi.
That’s really hard.	Chayqa chiqap sasam.
I want to be taken seriously	Munani allinpaq hapisqa kayta

He had been happy before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kusisqa kasqa.
We’re stupid though.	Sonso kayku ichaqa.

Everything seemed fine here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
They still weren’t sure.	Paykunaqa manaraqmi segurochu karqanku.
It may not be true.	Manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
But I really want to know	Ichaqa anchatam yachayta munani
I would like him to come back	Munaymanmi kutimunanta
I thought about it for a while	Huk tiempotan yuyaykurqani
He knows it’s more than that.	Payqa yachanmi chaymanta aswan kasqanmanta.
So I wanted to get out.	Chaymi lluqsiyta munarqani.
I thought it was very interesting	Ancha sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I couldn’t believe it was real	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I have to do that several times	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwanay
I wish he knew how to do it	Munaymanmi imayna ruwayta yachananpaq
But he didn't know exactly what it was.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yacharqan imachus kasqanmanta.
I have never been happier as a senior	Manam haykapipas aswan kusisqachu karqani kuraq kasqaymanta
You know that you are.	Yachankim chayna kasqaykita.
I really want to help	Chiqamanta yanapayta munani
But he knew something was seriously wrong.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imapas sinchi mana allin kashasqanmanta.
I mean, you had to do it.	Niyta munani, qamqa ruwanayki karqa.
I know it is important	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta
He is speaking now.	Payqa kunanmi rimachkan.
I don’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikunichu
I won’t be the only adult there	Manam ñuqallachu chaypiqa kuraq runa kasaq
I tried to do my best.	Tukuy atisqayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
But the first important fact is.	Ichaqa ñawpaq kaq importante kaq cheqaq kaqmi.
I couldn't do that here	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I was very impressed	Sinchitan admirakurqani
Why are you doing that?	Imaraykutaq chayta ruwanki.
And there we are.	Hinaspa chaypi kayku.
I wish you a pleasant journey	Munaymanmi sumaq puriyta
Easy for me.	Facil ñuqapaq.
I didn’t expect him, after all	Manam paytaqa suyarqanichu, tukuy imamanta

He'll probably be more himself tomorrow.	Payqa yaqapaschá paqarin aswan pay kikin kanqa.
Maybe never again.	Ichapas manaña haykapipas.
I didn’t see much of anyone	Manam anchatachu pitapas rikurqani
I didn’t expect that.	Manam chaytaqa suyarqanichu.
I really didn't want to go along with it	Chiqaptaqa manam chaywan kuska riyta munarqanichu
I can't resist responding	Manam kutichiyta harkayta atiymanchu
It just seemed reasonable.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinallam rikchakurqa.
I know why you did it	Yachanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqaykita
I heard that a lot	Chaytaqa anchatam uyarirqani
I won't be happy there either.	Ñuqapas manam chaypiqa kusisqachu kasaq, nispa.
They weren’t like you.	Paykunaqa manan qan hinachu karqanku.
I know what happened to him	Yachanim paywan imapas pasasqanmanta
I don’t need things now.	Kunanqa manan necesitasaqchu imakunatapas.
I mean he was really good for her	Niyta munani payqa chiqap allin karqa paypaq
You might want to check that out there.	Chaytaqa ichapas chaypi qawayta munanki.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.

Not like before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu.
I almost thought, great, he finally got it	Yaqapaschá yuyaykurqani, ancha allinmi, payqa tukukuypi chayta chaskirqan
I'm not here to talk about it	Manam kaypichu kachkani chaymanta rimanaypaq
He is extremely pathetic.	Payqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi.
I wonder how they are now	Kunan imayna kasqankuta tapukuni
I hope everyone is.	Suyachkani llapallanku chayna kasqankuta.
I think that is true	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani
I didn’t know how to do this	Manam yacharqanichu kayta ruwayta
I want to tell you something.	Imatapas willayta munani.
I wasn’t really sure what he was here to do	Manam chiqaptachu seguro karqani ima ruwananpaq kaypi kasqanmanta

He can’t be alone.	Payqa manan sapallan kayta atinchu.
I’m glad he’s happy.	Kusikuni kusisqa kasqanmanta.
So thanks for that.	Chaymi chaymanta gracias.
I wish that wasn’t the case	Munaymanmi mana chayna kananta

Two years of sadness and loneliness.	Iskay wata llakisqa, sapallay ima.

And the second year.	Hinaspa iskay kaq wata.
I can't be together every day and every night	Manam sapa punchaw hinaspa tukuy tuta kuska kayta atiymanchu

I won’t go that long	Manam chay unaytachu risaq
Then he looked happy.	Chaymanta kusisqa qhawarisqa.
I just didn’t know any other way	Chaylla mana huk ñanta yacharqanichu
This was the night.	Kayqa tutan karqan.
I can’t talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t be with that	Chaywanqa manam ñuqaqa kayta atirqanichu
I know why he is famous.	Yachanim imanasqa riqsisqa kasqanmanta.
That’s what he wanted to be.	Chayna kaytam munarqa.
I, too, wonder.	Ñuqapas, tapukuni.
I won’t be alone for long	Manam unaytachu sapallay kasaq
I don't know how anyone manages to do that.	Manam yachanichu pipas chayta ruwananpaq imayna kasqanmantaqa.
He would never want that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munanmanchu.
I feel comfortable in it now	Kunanqa allintam chaypi tarikuni
In the city.	Llaqtapi.
And he’s going.	Hinaspa payqa rin.
Now it’s better to go.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi riy.
I think he’s a terrible man	Yuyaykuni manchay runa kasqanmanta
That's what I heard yesterday	Chaynatam qayna punchaw uyarirqani
I thought it would be easier.	Aswan facilmi kananta yuyaykurqani.
Say what was supposed to happen.	Imachus kanan karqan chayta niy.
I won’t be unreasonable	Manam mana yuyayniyuqchu kasaq
Now it doesn’t exist.	Kunanqa manan kanchu.
Someone could have been hurt.	Pipas k’irisqa kanman karqan.

He was very much a loner.	Payqa anchatam sapallan runa karqa.

You can’t stay out of it.	Manan chaymanta hawapi qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.

I really mean a lot.	Chiqamanta anchata niyta munani.

No one could understand.	Manan pipas entiendeyta atirqanchu.
Worse, he wanted it to happen again.	Aswan mana allinqa, hukmanta chayna kananta munarqa.
I really didn’t want to be.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta munarqanichu.
He couldn’t wait to win.	Payqa manan atipayta suyayta atirqanchu.
I was happy to be there.	Ñuqaqa kusisqam karqani.
I, the man.	Ñuqa, chay runa.
I'm sorry, she finally said.	Pampachaykuway, nispas tukukuypi nirqa.
I was very proud of that	Chaymantam anchata orgulloso karqani
I can’t really tell you.	Manam chiqaptaqa willayta atiymanchu.
But then that has to be quick.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chayqa usqhayllan kanan.
Everything was amazing.	Tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi karqa.
The process, however, will not be easy.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa mana facilchu kanqa.
There’s no telling what it might do.	Mana willay kanchu imatachus ruwanman chayta.
Who was it, really.	Pitaq kasqa, chiqaptapuni.
I didn’t realize the problem existed	Manam repararqanichu chay sasachakuy kasqanmantaqa
I really didn’t want to talk to him	Chiqaptaqa manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu
He was here for a week.	Payqa huk semanan kaypi kasqa.
No one knew where you were.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kasqaykita.
You knew they were here.	Yacharqanki kaypi kasqankuta.
I want to tell you about it but I can’t	Chaymanta willayta munani ichaqa mana atinichu
I know this is not funny	Yachanim kayqa manam asikunapaq hinachu
I knew there were people there	Yacharqanim chaypi runakuna kasqanmanta
That’s what I think about all the time.	Chaypin sapa kutilla yuyaykuni.
In other words, he was happy.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa kusisqam tarikurqa.
Hopefully that doesn’t happen	Munaymanmi chay mana pasananta
I can’t believe a week has gone by	Mana creeyta atinichu huk semana pasasqanmanta
This was a novelty.	Kayqa huk musuq ruwaymi karqa.
I can't believe he would	Manam creeyta atinichu chayna ruwananta

Last year I was real.	Qayna wata chiqap kaqmi karqani.

A man like me.	Ñoqa hina runa.
I’ll be better off.	Aswan allinmi kasaq.
Here I am, alone, day and night	Kaypim kachkani, sapallay, tuta punchaw
I wouldn’t have done that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
I was as surprised as anyone.	Pipas hinam admirakurqani.
I mean, you were a mystery	Niyta munani, qamqa pakasqa runam karqanki
He doesn’t know any better.	Payqa manan aswan allintachu yachan.
I just couldn’t wait for something else that wasn’t safe	Chaylla mana suyayta atirqanichu huk mana seguro kaqta
That’s not a good thing though.	Chayqa manan allinchu ichaqa.
I can't deal with being the bad guy for him anymore.	Manañam atipayta atinichu paypaq mana allin runa kayqa.
I knew what worked for me	Yacharqanim imakuna ñuqapaq allin kasqanmanta
I know how to listen	Uyariyta yachani
He's one of them, she said.	Payqa hukninmi, nispas nin.
He wants to leave, he said.	Ripuyta munan, nispas nisqa.
He said there are bad people in the world, really bad people.	Paymi nirqa kay pachapi millay runakuna kan, chiqap millay runakuna.
No it wasn’t like that.	Manan manan chay hinachu karqan.
I still couldn’t believe it was happening	Manaraqmi creeyta atirqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
I hope everyone is fine	Suyachkani llapallanku allin kasqankuta
That was ridiculous	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa

I smoked a cigarette	Huk cigarrota pitaq kani
I’d like to sleep.	Puñuyta munayman.
But no one wants to do it hard.	Ichaqa manan pipas munanchu sasa ruwaytaqa.
I was the guy who was.	Ñuqam chay runa karqani.
I’m not going to do this.	Kaytaqa manam ruwasaqchu.
It’s a beautiful night.	Sumaq tutam.
I can’t find it.	Mana tariyta atinichu.
That’s what left him.	Chayqa saqirqa.

I didn’t want to be there.	Manam chaypi kaytaqa munarqanichu.

It’s bad out there right now.	Mana allinmi chay hawapi kunanpacha.
You’ll go with it.	Chaywanmi rinki.
It’s about what’s right and what’s wrong.	Imakuna allin kasqanmanta, imakuna mana allin kasqanmantam rimachkan.
Yes, he thought about it.	Arí, payqa yuyaykurqanmi.

It’s a process.	Huk ruwaymi.
I am really excited about this	Kaymantaqa anchatam kusikuni

Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kachkan.
How did you do it?.	¿Imaynatataq ruwarqanki?.
I know how and why it happened	Yachanim imayna hinaspa imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta
It takes time.	Tiempotan necesitan.
But I didn’t say that	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nirqani
I want to be a part of this	Kaymanta huknin kaytam munani
I haven’t seen anything like it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaynataqa rikurqanichu.
I didn't know this.	Kaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.

Very tired afterwards though.	Ancha sayk’usqa qhepaman ichaqa.
About three times.	Yaqa kimsa kuti.
He did the wrong thing.	Payqa mana allintam ruwarqa.

I had better go	Aswan allinmi kanman karqan rinaypaq
This is mine.	Kayqa ñuqapa.
I had no intention of doing this	Manam kayta ruwanaypaqqa piensarqanichu
I want to talk to you right now.	Kunanpacha qanwan rimayta munani.
Something about him, maybe.	Imapas paymanta, ichapas.
If it’s not good, don’t do it.	Mana allin kaptinqa ama ruwaychu.
So, you know,.	Chaymi, yachanki,.
I thought you were good at this	Kaypi allin kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
Too often incorrectly.	Ancha achka kuti mana allinta.
I thought it would be sad	Llakikuypaqmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani
He was as stupid as a child.	Payqa wawa hina sonso kasqa.
I can’t say anymore, either.	Manañam niyta atiymanchu, ñuqapas.

But forgive me.	Ichaqa pampachaykuway.

I can't stop that	Chaytaqa manam harkayta atiymanchu
And know what’s right.	Hinaspa yachay imachus allin kaqta.
Had he been alone, everything would have been much easier.	Sapallan kanman karqan chayqa, tukuy imapas aswan facilmi kanman karqan.
I thought, anyway	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim, imayna kaptinpas
I'm sure there's nothing.	Seguro kani mana imapas kasqanmanta.

To make things less easy.	Imapas mana ancha facil kananpaq.
To do more.	Astawan ruwanapaq.
I imagined what the day was like	Chay punchawqa imayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I immediately knew it was him	Chayllam yacharqani pay kasqanmanta
Humanity is not humanity.	Runa kayqa manam runachu.
Now you need to act quickly.	Kunanqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
He goes alone.	Payqa sapallanmi rin.
I don’t feel comfortable with it.	Mana chaywanqa allintachu sientekuni.
That’s all, nothing more.	Chaylla, mana imapas aswan.
He is faster than her.	Payqa paymanta aswan utqayllam.
I never realized that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa repararqanichu
I wouldn’t be happy	Manam kusisqachu kayman karqa
That would be the right person to do it.	Chayqa allin runan kanman chayta ruwananpaq.
He is no longer there.	Payqa manañam chaypichu kachkan.
I’d be there for a while	Huk tiempo chaypi kayman
That’s you guys.	Chayqa qanmi kanki.
I heard it less than an hour ago	Manaraq huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi uyarirqani
I knew what was coming.	Yacharqanim imakuna hamunanta.
It is the largest in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan hatunmi.
Unfortunately I failed	Llakikuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqani
I’ve heard it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanim.
This was now the third.	Kayqa kunanqa kimsa kaqmi karqa.
But these are important.	Ichaqa kaykunaqa ancha allinmi.
I don’t know that he did.	Mana yachanichu chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, he was.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa karqan.
I hope this happens	Suyachkani kay pasananta
He's right, but he doesn't care.	Payqa allintam nin, ichaqa manam imananpaschu.
Everyone should be.	Llapa runam kanan.
I don’t know why, really.	Mana yachanichu imarayku, chiqamanta.
That’s easy to do.	Chayqa ruwayqa facilmi.
I pretty much know what that is.	Yaqapaschá yachani imachus chay kasqanmanta.
It won’t always be this way.	Manan sapa kutichu kay hina kanqa.
He says you can't.	Payqa manam atiwaqchu nispam nin.
I was so excited about it	Anchatam kusisqa karqani
I want to be a teacher	Yachachiq kaytam munani
I can’t say anymore	Manañam niyta atiymanchu
But it will be soon.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
This made no sense at all.	Kayqa manam imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
I doubt that is the case.	Iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta.
I can do better, I can be better.	Aswan allinta ruwayta atiyman, aswan allin kayman.
Nobody likes it, nobody wants it.	Manan pipas gustanchu, manan pipas munanchu.
The man knew what he wanted.	Chay runaqa yacharqanmi ima munasqanta.
But something very strange happened.	Ichaqa imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi pasarqa.
I, unfortunately, am.	Ñuqaqa, llakikuypaqmi, chayna kani.
You don’t know what’s going to happen.	Manan yachankichu imachus kananta.
He got it right	Payqa allintan chayta hap’irqan
That was easy, he said.	Chayqa facilmi karqa, nispa.
A successful man cannot do without it.	Huk allin ruwaq runaqa manan mana chaywanqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
I wasn’t nearly as excited about this.	Manam yaqa chayna kusisqachu karqani kaymanta.
He’s better than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan allinmi.
There are a lot of people right now	Achka runakunam kunanpacha kachkan
How did it happen.	Imaynataq pasarqa.
I had no idea at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanichu
That was lucky	Chayqa suerteyoqmi karqan
I didn't see or hear anything last night	Qayna tutaqa manam imatapas rikurqanichu nitaq uyarirqanichu
I didn’t realize that	Chaytaqa manan repararqanichu
I knew he was a good guy	Yacharqanim allin runa kasqanmanta
In fact, there is nothing	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas kanchu
I can’t let that happen	Manam chay pasananta atiymanchu
And he’s doing it now.	Hinaspa payqa kunan ruwaspa.
She looks very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Everyone wants a big chunk of it.	Lliwmi munanku hatun qullqita chayta.
It meant something at the time though.	Chay tiempopiqa imapas niyta munarqa ichaqa.
It will be the best	Aswan allin kaqmi kanqa
This was certainly one of them.	Kayqa chiqamanta hukninmi karqa.
This time around.	Kay kutipi.
He didn’t really want to.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu munarqan.
I can't be sure.	Mana seguro kayta atinichu.
What is the problem.	Imataq chay sasachakuy.
I can't fix this	Kaytaqa manam allichayta atiymanchu
He couldn’t find her there.	Payqa manan chaypi tariyta atirqanchu.
More and more.	Aswan aswan.
I want to do better things.	Aswan allin ruwaykunata ruwayta munani.
I never intended to say that, though	Manam haykapipas chayta niyta yuyaykurqanichu, ichaqa
Everyone agreed with him.	Lliwmi paywan acuerdopi karqaku.
No one likes him or wants to work with him.	Manan pipas paytaqa gustanchu nitaq paywan llank’ayta munanchu.
That will matter soon enough.	Chayqa pisi tiempollamantan importante kanqa.
So he gave it to me.	Chaymi quwarqa.
I was really bad at it	Chiqaptam chaypiqa mana allinchu karqani
It’s really important.	Chiqaptam ancha allin.
I want him here with me	Payta kaypi ñuqawan kuska munani
I know they are not crazy	Yachanim mana loco kasqankuta
He was the kid.	Payqa chay wawa kasqa.
And, indeed, some of the world.	Hinaspa, chiqaptapuni, wakin pacha.
I had no idea what was going on	Manam imakuna pasasqanmantaqa ni imapipas piensarqanichu
I’m glad to be with you	Kusikuni qanwan kaspa
I thought you wanted to know	Yachayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I don’t see why that would be the case.	Manam rikunichu imarayku chayna kananta.
That was a bad thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
Unfortunately no one has done it before.	Llakikuypaqmi mana pipas ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanchu.
There were things that needed to be done.	Chaypin imakuna ruwana karqan.
I knew that, he knew that	Chaytaqa yacharqanim, payqa chaytam yacharqa
I didn’t expect it to happen	Manam suyarqanichu chayna kananta
But I want this	Ichaqa kaytam munani
It was a big deal at the time.	Chay tiempopi huk hatun ruwaymi karqan.
Now go and do what you have to do.	Kunan riy hinaspa ruwanaykita ruway.
I have not seen or witnessed this	Kaytaqa manam rikurqanichu nitaq rikurqanichu
It went big at the time.	Hatun rirqa chay pacha.
It didn’t matter now, though.	Kunanqa manan imananpaschu karqan, ichaqa.
I can’t say what it is	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmantaqa
I had to do something now	Kunanmi imatapas ruwanay karqa
I had to do it right	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanay karqa
There is no truth.	Manan kanchu cheqaq kaq.
But I don’t know how to say it	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna niyta
I know that feeling.	Yachanim chay sientekusqanmanta.
I can’t do it for him now	Kunanqa manañan paypaq ruwayta atiymanchu
It had to be the next person.	Chayqa kanan karqan qhepaman kaq runa.
He looked so great.	Payqa ancha hatunmi rikchakurqa.
I really like this one	Kayqa anchatam gustan
The next year, the player moves on from there.	Qatiqnin wata, pukllaq chaymanta hawaman rin.
He did his best.	Tukuy atisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
This is the first step.	Kaymi ñawpaq kaq ruway.
I think there are two things there	Chaypiqa iskay imakuna kasqanmantam piensani
I think that is the hardest part.	Chayqa aswan sasa kasqanmantam piensani.
If it’s good, you know that.	Allin kaptinqa chaytam yachanki.
Even if it is different.	Huk hina kaptinpas.
I think you can go home now	Yuyaykuni kunan wasiykiman atisqaykita
I was always happy alone	Sapa kutim sapallay kusisqa karqani
I couldn't remember what they looked like	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqankuta
But it looks nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
I think it would be great for you	Yuyaykuni ancha allin kanman qanpaq
I used to be a teacher, you know.	Ñawpaqtaqa yachachiqmi karqani, yachanki.
Nothing seemed to work.	Manam imapas allinpaq hinachu karqa.
It wasn’t the only thing that worked.	Manam chayllachu allin karqa.
Obviously he does.	Sut’inmi payqa chaytan ruwan.
And he was alone.	Hinaspa sapallan kasqa.
If so, let me know.	Chayna kaptinqa willaway.
He is just like a child, he is very happy.	Payqa wawa hinallam, ancha kusisqam kachkan.
I seriously doubt this	Kaymantaqa allintam iskayrayani
Yes, now .	Arí, kunanqa .
There really is no reason.	Chiqaptaqa manam imaraykupas kanchu.
I think it's beautiful.	Sumaq kasqanmantam piensani.
But the future looks bright.	Ichaqa hamuq tiempopiqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
I couldn’t sleep at all	Manam ni imapipas puñuyta atirqanichu
I couldn't remember how many years ago.	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu hayka wata ñawpaqtaqa.
I want to think about this for a while	Kaypi huk rato yuyaymanayta munani
That you can do that.	Chayna ruwayta atisqaykita.
Yes, you are very beautiful.	Arí, ancha sumaqmi kanki.
I didn’t know you knew	Manam yacharqanichu yachasqaykita
You know this would be good for me.	Yachankim kayqa ñuqapaq allin kanman.
I knew things would work out	Yacharqanim imapas allin kananta
I could never let anything happen	Manam haykapipas imapas pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I haven’t been here before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa kaypichu karqani
Perhaps it was at one time.	Ichapas huk tiempopi chayna karqa.
I knew that was funny	Chayqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam yacharqani
I was supposed to be there an hour earlier	Huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi kanay karqa
I can't think about it now	Kunanqa manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I wonder when this happened	Tapukuni haykapi kay pasasqanmanta
I'd rather not talk about it	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaymanta rimayqa
In fact, that would be a good thing.	Aswanpas chayqa allinmi kanman.
No, it’s not like that.	Manan, manan chay hinachu.
A lot went into that.	Chaypaqqa achkatam rirqa.
I had to be there	Chaypim kanay karqa
I always had to be	Sapa kutim chayna kanay karqa
I’m thinking about it	Chaypin yuyaykushani
What a foolish man.	Ima mana yuyayniyuq runa.
He said it was beautiful.	Sumaq kasqanmantam nirqa.
One day I couldn't think	Huk punchawqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I almost feel like I did.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwasqayta sientekuni.
I want to hear you say that	Chayta nisqaykita uyariyta munani
that evening.	chay chisi.
He can’t eat, he can’t sleep.	Mana mikhuyta atinchu, mana puñuyta atinchu.
There is time for that later.	Chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo kan.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
I am so excited!.	¡Ancha kusisqam kachkani!.
I want everyone here right now	Munani llapallanku kaypi kunanpacha
He never knew why he was arrested.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu imarayku hap’isqa kasqanmanta.
All the time, anywhere.	Tukuy pacha, maypipas.
I think this time will be good	Kay kuti allin kananpaqmi yuyaykuni
This wasn’t the case.	Kayqa manam karqachu.
You can do anything for ten days.	Chunka punchawmi imatapas ruwawaq.
I’m not sure anyone has.	Manam segurochu kani pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Then again, it may not be true.	Chaymanta yapamanta, manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
I’m going to do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwasaq.
That’s what it was supposed to be.	Chayna kanan karqa.
I had trouble in the car	Carropi sasachakuypi tarikurqani
Something was wrong, very wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa, ancha mana allinchu karqa.
He couldn’t find it.	Payqa manam tariyta atirqachu.
I have a lot of thoughts on this	Kaymantaqa achka yuyayniyuqmi kani
I wanted to know as much as you did	Ñoqapas qan hinan yachayta munarqani
You are a man of sound judgment.	Allin yuyayniyuq runam kanki.
I don't know why it didn't.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
That is one of many things we have done in the past.	Chayqa ñawpaqpi achka ruwasqaykumanta hukninmi.
A year ago, it was supposed to be his	Huk wata ñawpaqtaqa, paypaq kanan karqa
I can't believe so many people would be here	Manam creeyta atiymanchu achka runakuna kayman kasqankuta
I didn’t want to do that at all	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu ni imapipas
He did that today.	Kunan punchawmi chayta ruwarqa.
I can't remember where	Maypi kasqanmantaqa manam yuyariyta atinichu
I want to know what’s going on here	Kaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I thought he had a good idea	Ñuqaqa allin yuyayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I can’t do it anymore	Manañam ruwayta atiymanchu
I can't get out if that happens.	Manam lluqsiyta atiymanchu sichus chayna kaptinqa.
I almost feel sorry for him	Yaqapaschá paymanta llakikuni
I know there are a lot of good people out here	Yachanim kay hawapi achka allin runakuna kasqanmanta
In fact, there was something there.	Aswanpas chaypiqa imapas kachkarqa.
I didn’t expect to hear it tonight	Manam suyarqanichu kunan tuta uyariyta
Less often, more.	Aswan pisi kutita, astawan.
Be with us now.	Kunan ñuqaykuwan kay.
I’m so sorry this happened.	Anchatan llakikuni kay pasasqanmanta.
I knew exactly what he could do	Allintam yacharqani ima ruway atisqanmanta
I mean, everything went well.	Niyta munani, tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
Instead, it can be detrimental.	Aswanpas mana allintachu ruwanman.
I couldn't believe how good it felt	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna allin sientekusqanmanta
It was included here.	Kaypim churasqa karqa.
I don’t know how to say this.	Manam yachanichu kayta niyta.
Again, it wasn’t easy.	Yapamanta, mana facilchu karqa.
I didn’t want to, actually	Manam munarqanichu, chiqaptaqa
Getting rich is easy.	Qhapaq kayqa facilmi.
He is not happy about what has happened.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan imachus pasasqanmanta.
He is right anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas allintam rimachkan.
I’ve barely heard that	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá uyarirqani
But that was not the case at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I feel that it is	Chayna kasqanmantam sientekuni
I didn’t really know why	Manam anchatachu yacharqani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
It was cold, cold.	Chiri, chiri kasqa.
Maybe I need it anyway.	Ichapas necesitasaq imayna kaptinpas.
I always want to sleep	Sapa kutim puñuyta munani
And that was a year ago.	Hinaspa chayqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I had to take immediate action	Chayllam ima ruwaytapas ruwanay karqa
I know what I need to do	Yachanim ima ruwanayta necesitasqanmanta
He was wrong here.	Kaypiqa pantasqa kasqa.
I didn’t see any other action	Manam huk ruwaytapas rikurqanichu
I didn’t really know who he was	Manam allintachu yacharqani pi kasqanmanta
I feel so wonderful now.	Kunanqa ancha sumaqmi sientekuni.
That says something	Chayqa imatapas ninmi
This was a crazy thing for him to do.	Kayqa huk loco ruwaymi karqan, chaymi payqa ruwanan karqan.
Every two months.	Sapa iskay killa.
She was beautiful, but she wasn't.	Payqa sumaqmi karqan, ichaqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
But the truth is, almost no one really knows.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, yaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
He used to do it.	Ñawpaqtaqa paymi chayta ruwaq.
He is long gone.	Payqa unayñan manaña kanchu.
It was like every week.	Sapa semana hinam karqa.
And was this the case.	Hinaspa kaychu karqan.
The house in the city.	Llaqtapi kaq wasi.
No, it's not.	Manan, nispa.
I didn’t expect it to be	Manam suyarqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
Tomorrow night is great.	Paqarin tutaqa ancha allinmi.
And that he didn’t want to.	Hinaspa mana munasqantapas.
He is doing great today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha allinta ruwachkan.
I had no idea why	Manam piensarqanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t notice it before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam repararqanichu
I can’t do what you were in the past	Manan ñawpaqpi kasqaykita ruwayta atiymanchu
But it was supposed to be.	Ichaqa chayna kanan karqa.
He seemed very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
Never, never will be.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
That thing was huge.	Chay imapas hatunmi karqa.
I seemed so confused	Ancha pantasqa hinam karqani
So it’s very exciting.	Chaymi ancha kusisqa.
I never gave it much thought	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa anchatachu piensarqani
Everything is now.	Tukuy imapas kunanmi kachkan.
Maybe he wanted to.	Ichapas munarqa.
I had to be bigger than this	Kaymanta aswan hatunmi kanay karqa
I am really very drunk.	Chiqaptam ancha machasqa kani.
I wonder what they are	Tapukuni imakuna kasqankuta
I didn’t know he was married	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqanmanta
Go alone now.	Kunan sapallayki riy.
So for me, it’s.	Chaymi ñuqapaq.
Go home now.	Kunan wasiykiman riy.
What happened to you.	Imataq qanwan pasarqa.
Yes, there was some truth here.	Arí, kaypi wakin cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
I didn’t know who he was.	Manam yacharqanichu pi kasqanmantaqa.
I feel much better about this	Kaymantaqa aswan allintam sientekuni
I can’t be human anymore	Manañam runa kayta atiymanchu
First, find out why you are not doing anything.	Ñawpaqtaqa yachay imarayku manaña imatapas ruwasqaykita.
I just didn’t realize how much	Chaylla mana repararqanichu hayk’a kasqanmanta
Where he was last night.	Maypichus qayna tuta kasqa.
I listened a bit to make sure	Huk chhikanta uyarirqani seguro kanaypaq
But I doubt that	Ichaqa chaymantam iskayrayani
Now that’s something.	Kunanqa chayqa imapas.
I really didn’t want to answer that question	Chiqamanta mana chay tapuyta kutichiyta munarqanichu
He could do this well.	Payqa kaytan allinta ruwayta atinman karqan.
I know it's out there somewhere	Yachanim maypipas hawapi kasqanmanta
But it didn’t go too well after that.	Ichaqa manan ancha allintachu rirqan chay qhepaman.
He is right about it.	Payqa allintam chaymanta rimachkan.
He was there, he was there.	Payqa chaypi kasqa, chaypi kasqa.
I think that is what it is.	Chayqa kasqanmantam piensani.
I’ve been around for a long time	Ñuqaqa unayñam kachkani
You might as well.	Qampas ichapas.
It just might be.	Chaylla ichapas kanman.
This is a much more interesting process.	Kayqa aswan sumaq ruwaymi.
It makes a bigger amount of money.	Aswan hatun qullqita ruwan.
He knew he wanted to be with us.	Payqa yacharqanmi ñoqaykuwan kuska kayta munasqanmanta.
I was crazy, that was all	Loco karqani, chayllam karqa
I think this is the right thing to do	Kayqa allin ruwaymi nispan yuyaykuni
That was immediately appropriate.	Chayqa chayllam allin karqa.
Here's what you can do about it.	Kaypim chaymanta imata ruwawaq.
That’s not the case with this.	Chayqa manan kay hinachu.
I know what kind of people you are.	Yachanim imayna runakuna kasqaykita.
I’m looking for the truth.	Chiqap kaqta maskachkani.
I know what is in trouble	Yachanim imakuna sasachakuypi kasqanmanta
I'm sure I'm right.	Seguro kani chiqap kasqaymanta.
I wasn't sure exactly when that happened	Manam allintachu yacharqani haykapi chay pasasqanmantaqa
I really look forward to seeing this.	Chiqaptam suyachkani kayta qawayta.
Maybe there was someone there.	Ichapas chaypi pipas karqa.
He would be sadly mad.	Payqa llakisqa loco kanman.
Make sure you do it.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq hina ruway.
I was tired that day	Chay punchawmi sayk’usqa karqani
But I’m not sure who would want that	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani pichus chayta munanman chayta
I just wasn’t there.	Ñuqaqa mana chayllachu karqani.
That’s good everyone.	Chayqa allinmi llapallanku.
Maybe this will come in handy.	Ichapas kayqa allinpaq kanqa.
I didn’t really think anything of it	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
I couldn’t see or hear it now	Manam kunanqa qawayta nitaq uyariyta atirqanichu
I felt very angry	Sinchi phiñasqa tarikurqani
There was no such thing here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna imapas karqachu.
I feel great about it	Chaymantaqa anchatam sientekuni
It was like two people.	Iskay runa hinam karqa.
I didn’t see anything really bad about it	Manam chiqap mana allintachu chaypiqa rikurqani
I couldn’t believe she went with me	Manam creeyta atirqanichu ñuqawan risqanmanta
But it’s not working properly.	Ichaqa manan allintachu llank’ashan.
Funny thing, that.	Asikunapaq hina, chay.
He’s not sure how many.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I’m better off.	Aswan allinmi kani.
A beautiful day last year	Qayna wata huk sumaq punchaw
I can do everything right	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwayta atiyman
I wasn’t good at it	Manam chaypiqa allinchu karqani
Go make someone.	Riy pitapas ruwanaykipaq.
It was such a night.	Chayna tutam karqa.
He almost couldn't believe how many there were.	Yaqa mana creeyta atirqachu hayka kasqankuta.
One of these.	Huk chaymanta.
That’s what I wanted to tell you	Chaytan willayta munarqani
He likes it a lot	Paytaqa anchatam gustan
We are proud of that.	Chaymantam orgulloso kayku.
I know something is wrong	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yachani
But he didn't know what to do.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
He doesn't look very good, either.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu rikchakun, nitaq.
There is no one here.	Manam pipas kaypi kanchu.
I meant almost last night	Yaqa qayna tutam niyta munarqani
I don't disagree with that	Chaywanqa manam mana acuerdopichu kani
I knew they were stupid	Yacharqanim sonso kasqankuta
I feel so much better now	Kunanqa ancha allinmi sientekuni
I'll be ready.	Listo kasaq.
A man of the city.	Llaqtamanta runa.
They are both great.	Iskayninkum hatun kanku.
I didn’t want to sleep	Manam puñuyta munarqanichu
Do a nice job.	Sumaq llamkayta ruway.
I soon learned something else	Pisi tiempollamantan hukta yacharqani
It was very cold.	Ancha chiri kasqa.
I wanted to ask him something	Payta imatapas tapuyta munarqani
I want no one else	Ñoqaqa munani manan pitapas
No, that’s not the worst part.	Manan, chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu.
But, what do I know.	Ichaqa, imatataq yachani.
It was actually very, very easy to do.	Chiqaptaqa ancha, ancha facil ruwaymi karqa.
So yes, it is.	Chaymi arí.
I was very, very confused.	Ancha, ancha pantasqa karqani.
Don’t forget and don’t forget.	Ama qunqaychu hinaspa ama qunqaychu.
I think they’re a little worried about you	Yuyaykuni qanmanta huk chhikanta llakisqa kasqankuta
I don't like it when he does this	Kayta ruwaptinqa manam gustawanchu
We’re fine, we’re fine.	Allinmi kachkaniku, allinmi kachkaniku.
I just couldn’t stand it	Chaylla mana aguantayta atirqanichu
I think you did what you could	Yuyaykuni atisqaykita ruwasqaykita
I didn’t know that at the time	Chaytaqa manan chay tiempopiqa yacharqanichu
I mean, everything.	Niyta munani, tukuy ima.
I wonder how it is	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni
I couldn’t be there	Manam chaypi kayta atirqanichu
I can't say for sure right now	Kunanqa manam allintachu niyta atiyman
Now I knew this was mine	Kunanqa yacharqanim kayqa ñuqapa kasqanmanta
Or this week.	Utaq kay semanapi.
I have had it for many years.	Achka watañam chaywanqa kachkani.
I mean, you were great.	Niyta munani, hatunmi karqanki.
And this was a good thing.	Hinaspa kayqa allinmi karqa.
Anyway, it was a success.	Imayna kaptinpas chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
This is still going on.	Kayqa hinallam kachkan.
You are a beautiful person.	Sumaq runam kanki.
I feel better there and then	Aswan allinta sientekuni chaypi chaymanta chaymanta
I know you are with him	Yachanim paywan kasqaykita
He is not that kind of person.	Payqa manam chayna runachu.
I can't sleep anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam puñuyta atinichu
So there is no reason.	Chaymi mana imaraykupas kanchu.
A couple of years younger than him, at least	Paymanta huk iskay wata sullk’a, aswanpas
I really don't want to talk about this	Chiqaptaqa manam kaymanta rimayta munanichu
Like him.	Pay hina.
If not, don’t do it.	Mana chayna kaptinqa ama ruwaychu.
He knows how he wants it to be somewhere.	Payqa yachanmi maypipas imayna kananta munasqanmanta.
A little bit of time.	Huk chikan pacha.
I don't think that's the case now.	Kunanqa manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
I just didn’t quite know what it was	Chaylla mana allintachu yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
I have been there for a very long time	Ancha unayñam chaypi kachkani
I, however, was sure he wouldn't	Ñuqam ichaqa seguro karqani mana ruwananmanta
Maybe that’s what this is.	Ichapas chayna kayqa.
It was the last one.	Qhipa kaq karqa.
I think that's a great thing	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani
I never thought about it, but maybe	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu, ichaqa yaqapaschá
And there it is again.	Hinaspa chaypi yapamanta kachkan.
But I don’t really agree.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu acuerdopi kani.
So it is set up to fail.	Chaymi mana allinta ruwananpaq churasqa kachkan.
You wouldn’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munawaqchu.
I just know it’s a bad time	Chaylla yachani mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta
He was very much with her.	Payqa anchatan paywan kasharqan.
I felt awkward and stupid	Mana allinchu hinaspa sonso hinam tarikurqani
That’s a very, very big deal.	Chayqa ancha, ancha hatunmi.
But I knew who he was	Ichaqa yacharqanim pi kasqanmanta
That was ten years ago.	Chayqa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
It went well.	Allintam pasarqa.
Very cold last night.	Ancha chiri qayna tuta.
To the real power.	Chiqap atiyman.
And the best part is.	Hinaspa aswan allinqa.
He always did it twice.	Payqa sapa kutim iskay kutita ruwarqa.
But for now it’s good.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa allinmi.
He was happy and happy.	Payqa kusisqa kusisqa kasqa.
I didn’t see that coming	Manam rikurqanichu chay hamunanta
He didn’t take it well.	Payqa manan allintachu hap’irqan.
I didn’t want to	Manam munarqanichu
Be here for me again.	Hukmanta kaypi kay ñuqapaq.
Pretty much everything is true.	Yaqapaschá tukuy imapas chiqap kanman.
I hope someone knows what to do	Suyachkani pipas ima ruwananta yachananta
One good, three bad.	Huk allin, kimsa mana allin.
I used to do it all the time	Ñawpaqtaqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kani
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
But he refused to leave.	Ichaqa manan ripuyta munarqanchu.
I was so nervous and exhausted.	Ancha mancharisqa, sayk’usqa ima karqani.
I know you don't want to do this	Yachanim kayta ruwayta mana munasqaykita
I can’t watch it	Manam qawayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t be stupid	Manam atirqanichu sonso kayta
I didn't care if it was	Manam imananpaschu karqa sichus chayna kasqanmantaqa
I think something is strange	Imapas mana riqsisqa kasqanmantam piensani
It’s just not good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu.
They seemed happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqa hinam karqaku.
Here's one.	Kaypi huk.
After that he did most of the work.	Chay qhepamanmi yaqa llapan llank’ayta ruwarqan.
A very big problem	Ancha hatun sasachakuy
Tell me what is true and what is not.	Willaway ima chiqap kasqanmanta, ima mana kasqanmanta.
I know how he feels	Yachanim imayna sientekusqanmanta
No, it certainly is.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
It’s going to be a big deal.	Hatun ruwaymi kanqa.
I cannot agree with that.	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopi kayta atiymanchu.
She would have been wonderful	Payqa ancha sumaqmi kanman karqa
I don’t see him, not yet	Manam paytaqa rikunichu, manaraqmi
Very very strong.	Ancha ancha sinchi.
I’m not doing it right.	Manam allintachu ruwachkani.
Now I know what to do.	Kunanqa yachanin imata ruwanayta.
Almost, but not quite.	Yaqa, ichaqa mana allintachu.
The cold came out.	Chiri lluqsirqa.
I saw him many times	Askha kutitan paytaqa rikurqani
Maybe I need more time.	Ichapas aswan tiempota necesitasaq.
I couldn’t do this to him	Manam paytaqa kayta ruwayta atirqanichu
I couldn't quit now	Kunanqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu
He never said anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas nirqanchu.
I was lucky too	Ñoqapas suerteyoqmi karqani
That’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan.
But there was always something.	Ichaqa sapa kutim imapas karqa.
I was out in the world doing what I do	Ñuqaqa kay pachapi hawapi karqani ruwasqayta ruwaspa
Man, that’s huge.	Runa, chayqa hatunmi.
I think there’s something else involved	Yuyaykuni huk imapas chaypi kasqanmanta
He knew things.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakunatapas.
I didn’t realize he was there	Manam repararqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta
But thanks again.	Ichaqa hukmanta gracias.
That was pretty quick.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam karqa.
He was older than her.	Payqa paymanta kuraq kasqa.
I wasn’t sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu karqani
I do it again and again	Yapamanta yapamanta ruwani
I was very happy with how it turned out	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani imayna kasqanmanta
I have no idea what the problem is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Every other day of the week.	Semanapi sapa iskay punchaw.
I wanted to know everything about it	Chaymanta tukuy imata yachayta munarqani
He found out later.	Qhepamanmi chayta yacharqan.
There is no way for that now.	Chaypaqqa kunanqa manam imapas kanchu.
I have done this successfully.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwarqani.
These are the people who live there.	Kaykunaqa chaypi tiyaq runakunam.
It’s big, it’s big.	Hatun, hatunmi.
I didn’t want to wait.	Manam suyayta munarqanichu.
I really enjoy doing this challenge.	Anchatan kusikuni kay sasachakuy ruwaspa.
Not this, not that.	Mana kay, mana chay.
Not sure what to do about it.	Mana segurochu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
Good people there.	Allin runakuna chaypi.
But he thought better of it.	Ichaqa aswan allintan chaypi yuyaykurqan.
This was the moment.	Kaymi karqan chay rato.
This meant money.	Kayqa qullqita niyta munarqa.
It really is that simple.	Chiqaptaqa chayna facilmi.
He didn’t want the gift.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chay regalota.
But at least doing something.	Ichaqa aswanpas imatapas ruwaspa.
I mean, unless that’s not the case	Niyta munani, mana chayqa mana chayna kaptinqa
It wasn’t true at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
I don’t want to be anything.	Manam imapas kayta munanichu.
New school building.	Musuq yachay wasi.
A year or two at most	Huk utaq iskay wata aswan achka
The important thing is what happens next.	Importante kaqmi chaymanta imakuna pasananta.
That’s what I think about all the time	Chaypin sapa kutilla yuyaykuni
I didn’t want to have to do this	Manam munarqanichu kayta ruwanay kasqanmanta
Unfortunately, things aren’t that simple.	Llakikuypaqmi, imapas mana chayna facilchu.
It doesn’t make sense at all	Manam imapaqpas kanchu ni imapaqpas
Great beauty here.	Hatun sumaq kaypi.
I thought about it all along	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon yuyaykurqani
He keeps saying all this everything is great.	Payqa hinallam nin tukuy kay tukuy ima hatun kasqanmanta.
But, you probably don’t want that.	Ichaqa, manachá chaytachu munanki.
I don't know what I'm looking for here.	Mana yachanichu imatataq kaypi maskachkani.
In fact, it was a bad time.	Aswanpas mana allin tiempon karqan.
Obviously I did something wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin ruwasqayta.
I can’t do anything about anything	Manam imamantapas imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I knew what was going on	Yacharqanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
I couldn’t speak anymore	Manañam rimayta atirqanichu
He couldn’t stop her.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atinmanchu karqan.
I didn’t want to wait that long	Manam chay unaytachu suyayta munarqani
I couldn't remember if it still happened	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu kunankamapas chayna kasqanmantaqa
I want to do well here	Kaypiqa allintam ruwayta munani
I felt like a kid again	Hukmanta wawa hinam tarikurqani
I didn’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu
But don’t forget to go outside.	Ichaqa ama qunqaychu hawaman lluqsiyta.
He probably said it was.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
Being tired was the best thing.	Sayk’usqa kaymi aswan allinqa karqan.
I want to be sad, now	Llakisqa kaytam munani, kunan
I was a player, just like you	Ñuqaqa pukllaq karqani, qam hina
More funny, that.	Aswan asikunapaq, chay.
Some of this stuff is really, really good.	Wakin kay imakuna chiqap, chiqap allin.
I almost feel guilty	Yaqapaschá huchayoq sientekuni
I thought something might be wrong.	Yuyarqanim imapas mana allinchu kanman nispa.
I don’t know how.	Mana yachanichu imaynata.
It wasn’t the only thing.	Manan chayllachu karqan.
I can’t tell you everything	Manam tukuy imatapas willayta atiymanchu
I hope you think about this.	Suyachkani kaypi yuyaymanayta.
And this is very interesting.	Hinaspa kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
That he couldn’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I want to eat someone here	Kaypi pitapas mikuyta munani
I didn’t really know why he was coming	Manam chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu imanasqa hamunanta
I still think this is true.	Kunankamapas kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Everything else is a process.	Tukuy imapas huk ruwaymi.
So that's not there.	Chaymi chayqa mana chaypichu kachkan.
I can’t really say	Manam chiqaptachu niyta atiyman
He was an hour early today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi huk hora temprano karqa.
Now it will be fine.	Kunanqa allinmi kanqa.
I thought you wanted to hear it	Uyariyta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Manañam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It doesn’t mean he didn’t.	Manam niyta munanchu mana ruwasqanmanta.
I thoroughly agreed.	Ñuqaqa allintam acuerdopi karqani.
Soon I’ll need real food	Pisi tiempollamantan cheqaq mikhunata necesitasaq
He knew they were proud of him.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta orgulloso kasqankuta.
I knew there was no reason for it	Yacharqanim mana imaraykupas chayna kasqanmanta
He does this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwan.
He was right there.	Payqa chaypim kachkarqa.
He was almost always like that.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim chayna karqa.
This is the hardest hardest part.	Kayqa aswan sinchi sinchi kaqmi.
I’m cold, cold, cold.	Chiri, chiri, chiri hina chiri kani.
Anyone but me.	Pipas mana ñuqallachu.
I really don't understand	Chiqaptaqa manam entiendenichu
We can’t be this.	Manam kayta atichwanchu.
How very much.	Imayna ancha.
I have no idea what happened to him after that	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani chaymanta imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
I don't think that will happen	Manam chayna pasananta piensanichu
It just looks so nice.	Chaylla ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I feel good today, happy	Kunan punchawmi allinta sientekuni, kusisqa
That afternoon.	Chay tarde.
I thought it was all funny	Tukuy imapas asikunapaq hinam piensarqani
I couldn’t understand how you knew	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imayna yachasqaykita
So he did the right thing	Chaymi allinta ruwarqa
He was never like that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
That was always a challenge.	Chayqa sapa kutim sasachakuy karqa.
I just wasn’t sure what was going to happen	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imachus kananmanta
Many rich people.	Achka qhapaq runakuna.
It’s his thing.	Paypaq kaqmi.
It almost seems that way.	Yaqapaschá chayna rikchakun.
Maybe you’d like to do the same.	Ichapas qampas chayta ruwayta munanki.
I did the same thing	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwarqani
He has no idea how to do it.	Payqa manan yuyaykunchu imayna ruwananta.
Almost no one did.	Yaqa mana pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I like it better	Aswan allintam gustan
He knew he had a lot of pride in this town.	Payqa yacharqanmi kay llaqtapi anchata orgulloso kashasqanmanta.
I know this is true of me.	Yachanim kayqa ñuqamanta chiqap kasqanmanta.
I think it is better.	Aswan allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t help it though	Manam yanapayta atinichu ichaqa
I know better what’s important.	Aswan allintan yachani imakuna importante kasqanmanta.
Maybe you’re beyond that.	Ichapas chaymanta hawapi kachkanki.
I'm sure things will work out	Seguro kani imapas allin kananmanta
Instead, it was beautiful.	Aswanpas sumaqmi karqan.
I need someone to be there	Pitapas chaypi kananpaqmi necesitasaq
But no, it’s nice.	Ichaqa manan, sumaqmi.
They are indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin kanku.
I know that is not always easy.	Yachanim chay ruwayqa mana sapa kutichu facil kasqanmanta.
I can't stand it anymore	Manañam aguantayta atiymanchu
I can't hold it	Manam hapiyta atiymanchu
He really couldn’t say.	Chiqamanta mana niyta atirqachu.
And that’s a big one.	Hinaspa chayqa hatunmi.
But not always seriously	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu sinchita
It stayed that way for a while.	Huk tiempon chay hina qhepakurqan.
He knows so much about who he is.	Payqa anchatam yachan pi kasqanmanta.
He knew this.	Payqa kaytam yacharqa.
But he could not speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I do everything for you	Tukuy imatam qampaq ruwani
I had a good day	Allin punchawmi karqani
I always think I need to do better and do better	Sapa kutim piensani aswan allinta ruwanay hinaspa aswan allinta ruwanay kasqanmanta
But you are right now.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki kunanpacha.
I never realized how bad it was	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I wish he knew what he was capable of	Munaymanmi ima atisqanmanta yachananta
I’m fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kani.
He’s a lot like me.	Payqa anchatam ñuqa hina.
And what’s so wrong with this.	Hinaspa imataq chayna mana allinchu kaypi.
I can't believe he would do this	Manam creeyta atinichu kayta ruwananta
Which is the biggest.	Imataq aswan hatun.
Today was to be the day he would finally do it.	Kunanmi kanan karqan chay p’unchay tukukuypi ruwanan p’unchay.
I think he’s done well	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqanmanta
All, all, all.	Tukuy, tukuy, tukuy.
This is truly a new era.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa mosoq tiempo.
Maybe I can't stand this anymore.	Ichapas manañam kaytaqa aguantayta atinichu.
He went according to his will	Munasqanman hinam rirqa
I’m really very sorry for him	Chiqamanta anchata llakikuni paymanta
I wish this wasn’t the case	Munaymanmi mana kayna kananta
That really could have been something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imapas kanman karqan.
I didn’t really think about it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan allintachu chaypi yuyaykurqani
I didn’t know how to help	Manam yacharqanichu imayna yanapayta
That was two years ago now.	Chayqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan kunanqa.
He wanted it to be as easy as possible.	Payqa munarqanmi atisqanman hina facil kananta.
That’s the head.	Chayqa uma.
I hope nothing is wrong	Suyachkani mana imapas mana allinchu kasqanmanta
I have no idea how he knows how to do that	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynatam chayta ruwayta yachan
It's not nearly as good anymore.	Manañam yaqa chayna allinchu.
I can do something now to help	Kunanmi imatapas ruwayman yanapanaypaq
He barely talked to anyone.	Payqa yaqapaschá piwanpas rimaq.
I wasn’t like that at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqani
This is like a child.	Kayqa huk wawa hinam.
It’s easy to talk about.	Facilmi rimayqa.
I just had to be	Chayllaraqmi kanay karqa
I couldn't be sure it would do the job	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu chay llamkayta ruwananmanta
I want to be wherever he is	Maypi kaptinpas kaytam munani
I knew it wasn't	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
It was kind of crazy.	Chayqa huk laya loco hinam karqa.
I hope this one will be.	Kay huknin kananta suyachkani.
I just heard about it.	Chayraqmi uyarirqani.
Something was really wrong.	Chiqamanta imapas mana allinchu karqa.
Being such a kid in school.	Yachay wasipi chayna wawa kay.
Say that's it.	Chayta niy.
I still think it is	Kunankamapas chayna kasqanmantam piensani
I just can’t go home anymore	Chaylla manaña wasiman riyta atinichu
I am very worried about something	Imamantapas anchatam llakikuni
And that’s the reality.	Hinaspa chaymi cheqaq kaq.
I am very, very sorry.	Anchatam, anchatam llakikuni.
But the third refused to do so.	Ichaqa kinsa kaqmi chayta ruwayta mana munarqanchu.
You can’t buy it.	Manam rantiyta atiwaqchu.
They want to know how you are doing.	Paykunaqa imayna kasqaykita yachayta munanku.
First things first though.	Ñawpaq kaq imakuna ñawpaqta ichaqa.
I don’t want to think about it.	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta munanichu.
You are a foolish man.	Mana yuyayniyuq runam kanki.
I know he’s tired	Yachanim sayk’usqa kasqanmanta
Fortunately, that’s easy.	Ancha kusisqa, chayqa facilmi.
I never noticed that before	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa repararqanichu
What’s the right thing to do.	Imataq allin kachkan.
That’s just the thing.	Chayqa chayllaraqmi.
He stayed there overnight, as usual.	Chaypin huk tuta qhepakurqan, sapa kuti hina.
Thank you in advance.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi gracias.
It’s a good thing to talk about.	Allinmi rimayqa.
This one is the hardest.	Kay hukninmi aswan sasa.
I want to see this play out.	Kay pukllayta rikuyta munani.
I want to thank you for that	Chaymantam gracias niyta munani
But he couldn't say anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas niyta atirqanchu.
And yes that was a man for you.	Hinaspa arí chayqa karqan qanpaq runa.
In a practical way.	Huk ruwaypi.
He looked unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
It really means a lot.	Chiqamanta anchata niyta munan.
I really wanted to know	Chiqamanta yachayta munarqani
So don’t do it.	Chaymi ama ruwaychu.
He doesn’t want to get caught.	Payqa manan munanchu hap’iyta.
I did, a few years ago	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqta
Now I know how to do that.	Kunanqa yachanin imaynatachus chayta ruwanaypaq.
I've had him for a long time	Unayñam payta hapini
He’s not yet.	Payqa manaraqmi.
I couldn’t do him	Manam paytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I don’t remember what happened next.	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan yuyarinichu.
He should be but where is he.	Payqa kanan ichaqa maypitaq kachkan.
I could never make it	Manam haykapipas chayayta atirqanichu
I didn’t know what was wrong.	Manam yacharqanichu ima millay kasqanmanta.
I wanted to be me again	Hukmanta ñuqa kaytam munarqani
I was pretty sure of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqani.
Every action is important.	Sapa ruwaymi ancha allin.
I’ve done it twice now	Kunanqa iskay kutitan chayta ruwarqani
Yeah, it’s that good.	Arí, chayna allinmi.
That lasted about three days.	Chayqa yaqa kimsa punchawmi karqa.
It would actually make sense.	Chiqaptaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
I don’t remember him	Manam paytaqa yuyarinichu
That’s how he learned.	Chaynatam yacharqa.
He knew it would happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kananta.
Maybe it’s here.	Ichapas kaypi kachkan.
Who knows what the future holds.	Pitaq yachan hamuq tiempopi imakuna kananta.
But the adults.	Ichaqa hatun runakuna.
Maybe it was true that there was nothing to do.	Ichapas chiqap karqa mana ima ruwanapaq kasqanmanta.
I was sick and ill.	Unqusqa, unqusqa ima karqani.
I was never very good at it.	Manam haykapipas ancha allinchu karqani chaypiqa.
I just couldn’t understand why I	Chaylla mana entiendeyta atirqanichu imarayku ñuqa
He is nothing like that.	Payqa manan imapas chay hinachu.
I thought it was pretty cool	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I did everything right	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqani
Like most people.	Yaqa llapan runakuna hina.
I didn't know how to answer that	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu imayna kutichiyta
I thought everything was that fast	Yuyarqanim tukuy imapas chay utqaylla kasqanmanta
The truth is, no one knows for sure.	Cheqaq kaqmi, manan pipas allintachu yachan.
I really wanted to talk	Anchatam rimayta munarqani
That’s what it is.	Chayqa ima.
They were all good people.	Llapallankum allin runakuna karqaku.
He was right about it.	Payqa chiqaptam nirqa.
I hope you can do the same	Suyachkani qampas chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
She was terrified of him.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan paymanta.
That was the reality.	Chayqa karqan cheqaq kaqmi.
I wasn’t ready to talk yet	Manaraqmi rimanaypaq hinachu karqani
That would have been a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi kanman karqa.
I was extremely tired and exhausted	Sinchi sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa ima karqani
So, he, now knows.	Chaymi, pay, kunan yachan.
The process is quicker and easier.	Chay ruwayqa aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan facilmi.
I can never remember	Manam haykapipas yuyariyta atinichu
I wonder if that happens all the time.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus sapa kutilla chayna kasqanmanta.
I would like to see more.	Munaymanmi astawan qawayta.
I have to do that wrong	Chaytaqa mana allintachu ruwanay tiyan
Not me, man.	Mana ñuqachu, runa.
They’re scared, angry, and confused.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, phiñasqa, pantasqa ima kanku.
I mean we’re not together anymore	Niyta munani manaña kuskachu kanchik
I wanted to hear him	Payta uyariyta munarqani
So, he did it.	Chaymi, payqa ruwarqa.
It really makes no sense.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I was totally ready to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi tukuy imamanta listo karqani
I am not sure of anything here	Kaypiqa manam imamantapas segurochu kani
I can't answer those	Chaykunataqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu
Something happened the next day.	Paqarinmi imapas pasarqa.
That’s the most important thing.	Chaytan aswan allinqa.
I was so proud of him	Anchatan paymanta orgulloso karqani
I didn’t know where to go	Manam yacharqanichu mayman rinaypaq
It’s probably not going to be a good thing.	Manachá allinchu kanqa.
This kind of thing is nice.	Kay laya imapas sumaqmi.
I would agree with that	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayman
There was no reason for it.	Manam imaraykupas chayna kasqanmantaqa karqachu.
When, he can’t tell.	Haykapi, mana willayta atinchu.
A few other things.	Iskay kimsa imakunatapas.
This is the last time.	Kaymi qhepa kuti.
Such a sad ?.	Chayna llakisqa ?.
I, too, thought he had half a mind	Ñuqapas, kuskan yuyayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani
They probably were.	Paykunaqa yaqapaschá chayna karqaku.
I never thought something like this would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayna imapas pasananta
That’s almost .	Chayqa yaqa .
I will certainly do it.	Chiqaptam ruwasaq.
Tell me how that happened.	Imayna chay pasasqanmanta willaway.
In the past, this was not the case.	Ñawpaq tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I didn’t want it to be human	Manam munarqanichu runa kananta
I didn’t expect him	Manam paytaqa suyarqanichu
Isn’t that fucking good.	Manachu chay millay allinchu.
I wonder if he knows	Yachanchu icha manachu chayta tapukuni
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinmi.
That was ridiculous.	Chay ruwasqanqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I can’t see that happening.	Mana chay pasananta rikuyta atinichu.
They were very nice people.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaq runakunam karqaku.
Yes, he wants to be out there.	Arí, payqa munanmi chay hawapi kayta.
He is the time.	Payqa tiempon.
I hope the baby is fine	Suyachkani wawa allin kananta
I hadn't thought about it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu
It was a cold one.	Chayqa chiri karqa.
It would certainly be useful for that.	Chaypaqqa cheqaqtapunin allin kanman.
I didn’t know how to study	Manam yacharqanichu estudiayta
He says he wants to work it out with me.	Payqa ninmi ñuqawan chayta allichayta munani nispa.
The action is very important.	Ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I thought it might be with you	Yuyarqanim qamwan kanman nispa
I still didn’t know his name	Kunankamapas manam sutinta yacharqanichu
It would be obvious.	Sut’inmi kanman.
Now at home.	Kunanqa wasipi.
He looked this way and that.	Payqa kayman chayman qhawarisqa.
I couldn’t think of anything	Manam imatapas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.	Sichus mana allintachu ruwan chayqa, mana allintachu ruwan.
Man can be beautiful	Runaqa sumaqmi kanman
I know he won't be back	Yachanim mana kutimunanta
If there is anything.	Imapas kaptinqa.
I am no longer the same person.	Manañam kikin runachu kani.
A child.	Huk wawa.
There was nothing I could do about it.	Chaypaqqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
I could never finish a meal here	Manam haykapipas kaypi mikuyta tukuyta atirqanichu
He knew he would.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
I desperately wanted to see her again	Sinchitan munarqani hukmanta rikuyta
It’s like today.	Kunan hinam.
It's all about how hard it is for him.	Tukuy imapas paypaq imayna sasa kasqanmantam.
I couldn’t have done it	Manam atiymanchu karqa
This is a pretty big one.	Kayqa allin hatunmi.
That’s what I wanted for him	Chaytan paypaq munarqani
He says he's sure.	Payqa segurom nin.
I wasn’t the same person	Manam kikin runachu karqani
I thought it was better	Aswan allinpaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
These are not taken seriously.	Kaykunaqa manam allintachu hapisqa kachkan.
I want to be that kind of person.	Chayna allin runa kaytam munani.
That last one was great.	Chay qhipa kaqmi ancha allin karqa.
I’m glad he did.	Kusikuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He’s probably the one.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna.
Can't remember the other one.	Mana huknin kaqta yuyariyta atinchu.
I saw everything	Tukuy imatam rikurqani
I really want to be just that	Anchatan munani chaylla kayta
Ideally, the latter.	Aswan allinqa, kay qhipa kaq.
I can't wait to see her like that again	Manam suyayta atiymanchu hukmanta chaynata qawayta
But they weren’t.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqanku.
I knew it had to go somewhere	Yacharqanim maymanpas rinan kasqanmanta
I was good at doing bad things	Allinmi karqani millay ruwaykunata ruwanaypaq
I never really thought about that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yuyaykurqani
And trouble at some point again.	Hinaspa sasachakuy huk tiempopi yapamanta.
I thought it would be uncomfortable	Yuyarqanim mana allinchu kanman nispa
If this is the case, do not take any action.	Chayna kaptinqa ama ima ruwaytapas ruwaychu.
I can’t afford a car yet	Manaraqmi carrota rantiyta atiymanchu
I still get him there you know	Hinallam payta chaypi hapini yachanki
I’m afraid it’s going to be bad.	Manchakuni mana allin kananta.
I knew this was true	Yacharqanim kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta
You want the wrong thing.	Mana allintam munanki.
Please tell me something.	Ama hina kaspa, imatapas willaway.
I didn’t know something like this would happen	Manam yacharqanichu kayna imapas pasananta
Good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuq.
You don’t want money.	Manam qullqita munankichu.
I just don’t see that happening.	Chaylla mana rikunichu chay pasananta.
Of this I am certain	Kaymantaqa segurom kachkani
I don’t know how, not yet	Manam yachanichu imayna, manaraqmi
They are never ever true.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu.
I think that was the first	Chayqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
I'm very serious.	Ancha serio kani.
I always knew it would happen one day	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani huk punchaw chayna pasananta
I know you were in the hospital with him for a while.	Yachanim huk rato paywan hospitalpi kasqaykita.
He was really hurting.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa kasharqan.
A good one, but that’s all	Allin kaq, ichaqa chaylla
I was actually okay with that	Chiqamanta chaywanqa allinmi karqani
He was good, and that was good.	Payqa allinmi karqa, chaymi allin karqa.
He’s been doing it for a long time.	Unayñan chayta ruwashan.
I’m afraid of what’s going to happen	Manchakuni imakuna pasananta
Sure there is a lot of truth to that.	Seguro kanmi achka chiqap chaymanta.
I may never go.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas risaqchu.
I tried to say something several times	Achka kutitam imatapas niyta munarqani
But no one knows anything.	Ichaqa manan pipas imatapas yachanchu.
I really wanted to find him	Cheqaqtapunin payta tariyta munarqani
It shouldn’t be like this, but it is.	Manan kay hinachu kanan, ichaqa chay hinan.
I knew it was great	Yacharqanim hatun kasqanmanta
Go home, your house.	Wasiykiman riy, qampa wasiykiman.
I was the one.	Paymi karqani.
I couldn't say why	Manam niyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
It was actually really good.	Chiqaptaqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
I have never done anything like you	Manam haykapipas qam hinaqa ruwarqanichu
I had trouble acting like a fool	Sonso hina ruwanaypaqmi sasachakuypi tarikurqani
I know it's stupid	Yachanim sonso kasqanmanta
I wanted to get out of town	Llaqtamanta lluqsiyta munarqani
Maybe more than that sometimes.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan wakin kuti.
How does that look like.	Imaynataq chay rikchakun.
I didn’t know you were in school	Manam yacharqanichu escuelapi kasqaykita
It never seemed to matter much.	Manam haykapipas ancha importante hinachu karqa.
I doubt if she thought of it, to be honest	Iskayrayani sichus pay yuyaykurqan chayta, cheqaqta rimanaypaq
He didn’t need to be richer, after all.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu aswan qhapaq kayta, tukuy imamanta.
I can’t go on with that	Manam chaywanqa puriyta atiymanchu
But he won’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwanqachu.
He wanted to do that.	Payqa chayta ruwayta munarqan.
That’s the bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinqa.
I know what you want to do	Yachanim ima ruway munasqaykita
It was a very great night	Ancha hatun tutam karqa
I am faster than you.	Qammanta aswan utqayllam kani.
No time for you.	Mana pacha qampaq.
But he refused to answer.	Ichaqa manan kutichiyta munarqanchu.
I know what he likes	Yachanim ima gustasqanmanta
Three years.	Kimsa wata.
I can’t have that exit	Manam chay lluqsiyta atiymanchu
It is cold most of the time.	Yaqa llapanpim chiri kachkan.
To be good again.	Hukmanta allin kananpaq.
A baby you’re not in a hurry	Huk wawa mana usqhayllachu kanki
I can’t believe you can be such a villain	Manam creeyta atiymanchu chayna millay runa kayta atisqaykita
The man is a man.	Runa runa.
I wasn’t comfortable at all	Manam allintachu karqani ni imapipas
There it was, however.	Chaypim ichaqa karqa.
Everything went away.	Tukuy imapas rirqa.
Not a smoking man.	Mana pitaq runa.
He wanted to go with me, he said.	Payqa munarqa ñuqawan riyta, nispa.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu ni imapipas.
I had no idea there were so many	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani chayna achka kasqanmanta
He said he was happy.	Payqa kusisqa kashasqanmantan nirqan.
Maybe there are three.	Ichapas kimsa kanman.
It’s kind of intelligent.	Imayna yuyayniyuqmi.
That would be the last step.	Chayqa qhepa kaq ruwaymi kanman.
We will have to do this quickly.	Kayta utqaylla ruwananchik kanqa.
You know things.	Imakunatapas yachanki.
This was certainly a new development.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa mosoq ruway karqan.
I don't think it's right or wrong.	Manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kasqanmantaqa manam piensanichu.
I knew it was true	Yacharqanim chiqap kasqanmanta
Okay, actually.	Allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
I'm going to go, he says.	Risaq, nispas nin.
I couldn’t stand anything	Manam imatapas aguantayta atirqanichu
I can’t leave it there	Manam chaypi saqiyta atiymanchu
We’re not ready yet	Manaraqmi listochu kayku
A great guy.	Huk hatun runa.
I know you have done a lot	Yachanim achkata ruwasqaykita
Faster, actually.	Aswan utqaylla, chiqaptaqa.
He was in the city.	Payqa llaqtapi kasqa.
He was there, and she knew it.	Payqa chaypi kasharqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
I want to know how that is	Imayna chay kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I didn’t want anyone else to be there	Manam munarqanichu huk runa chaypi kananta
He later died in hospital.	Qhepamanmi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
This was every day.	Kayqa sapa punchawmi karqa.
I really wanted to talk to him.	Anchatam paywan rimayta munarqani.
I would love to stay there again one day	Anchatan munani huk p’unchay hukmanta chaypi qhepakuyta
He doesn’t have to be sure or agree.	Payqa manan segurochu nitaq acuerdopichu kanan.
No one could say for sure.	Manan pipas seguro niyta atirqanchu.
I didn’t mean that	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu
I was fast but it was faster	Ñuqaqa utqayllam karqani ichaqa aswan utqayllam karqa
I never expected this	Kaytaqa manam haykapipas suyarqanichu
It was an angry act.	Chayqa phiñasqa ruwaymi karqan.
I want to ask him a lot of questions	Paytaqa achkatam tapuyta munani
Unfortunately it wasn’t any better.	Llakikuypaqmi mana aswan allinchu karqan.
I know the man is guilty	Yachanim chay runa huchayoq kasqanmanta
I didn't think he wanted to talk about it	Manam piensarqanichu chaymanta rimayta munasqanmanta
Direct.	Mana pantasqa.
He didn't know what to make of this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kaymanta imata ruwananta.
Can play first, second, third.	Ñawpaq, iskay kaq, kimsa kaq pukllayta atin.
I mean, it’s not.	Niyta munani, manam.
Man cannot buy anything, anywhere	Runaqa manam imatapas, maypipas rantiyta atinchu
I didn’t plan on doing that now	Kunanqa manan chayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
I don’t think this is a problem	Manam kayqa sasachakuy kananpaqchu piensani
And, of course no one can do this for so long.	Hinaspa, sut’inmi mana pipas kayta ruwayta atinmanchu chay hina unayta.
I was really hungry at the time	Chay tiempopiqa cheqaqtapunin yarqasqa karqani
He was so funny.	Payqa ancha asikunapaq hinam karqa.
But it doesn’t matter	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu
Please give it a try.	Ama hina kaspa, huk kutita ruway.
And do your best.	Hinaspa tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
I can’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
Are you happy now?.	¿Kunanqa kusisqachu kanki?.
All day and night.	Tukuy punchaw tuta.
I want to ask you something	Imatapas tapuyta munani
I was happy to go.	Kusisqam rirqani.
School	Yachay wasi
I really couldn’t say	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atirqanichu
I can’t go anywhere.	Manam maymanpas riyta atiymanchu.
I will never do it again.	Manañam haykapipas ruwasaqchu.
He thought about how quickly things happened.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imayna usqhaylla imapas pasasqanmanta.
Another interesting thing.	Huk sumaq imapas.
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna pasananta
I always wonder where things went wrong	Sapa kutim tapukuni maypi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
It was too much for him.	Chayqa llumpay hatunmi karqa paypaq.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Manam chayna kananpaqchu piensani.
I didn’t see him	Manam paytaqa rikurqanichu
But that’s a nice thing.	Ichaqa chayqa sumaqmi.
I’m just like you, too.	Ñuqapas qam hinam kani.
Is there such a thing?.	¿Kanchu chayna kaq?.
I didn’t want you to be in trouble	Manam munarqanichu sasachakuypi kanaykita
I hope it doesn’t	Suyachkani mana chayna kananta
I’m not going to do that	Manan chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
I tried to do more.	Astawan ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
I wanted to say his name but couldn't	Sutinta rimayta munarqani ichaqa manam atirqanichu
And it was supposed to be.	Hinan kanan karqan.
I feel really bad	Chiqamanta mana allintachu sientekuni
I still wonder why we made an announcement	Kunankamapas tapukuni imarayku huk willakuyta ruwasqaykumanta
That's really all there is to it.	Chayllam chiqaptaqa chaypiqa kachkan.
I hurried home	Usqhaylla wasiman rirqani
I know what it looks like	Yachanim imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta
I want to hear it all day	Tukuy punchawmi uyariyta munani
It happened twice in the car, actually.	Iskay kutitam carropi pasarqa, chiqaptaqa.
A great child.	Huk hatun wawa.
This will be a process	Kayqa huk ruwaymi kanqa
He can’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwayta atinchu.
He was obviously drunk.	Payqa sut’inmi machasqa kasharqan.
But there was something wrong with that.	Ichaqa chaypiqa mana allinmi karqa.
I know it will go well	Yachanim allinta pasananta
He will be a great mentor to me.	Payqa hatun yachachiqmi kanqa ñuqapaq.
And that couldn’t be better here.	Hinaspa chayqa manan kaypiqa aswan allinchu kanman.
Now he can't.	Kunanqa manam atinchu.
I think everyone knows who they are	Yuyaykuni llapa runa yachanku pikuna kasqankuta
That’s how it went.	Chaynatam rirqa.
I wish him well so much	Anchatam paytaqa allinta munani
You could still do well.	Hinallam allinta ruwawaq karqa.
He said he was lonely.	Payqa sapallan kashasqanmantan nirqan.
I didn’t want to believe it.	Manam creeyta munarqanichu.
You’ll do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanki.
I know how to stop it	Yachanim imayna harkayta
That doesn’t really sound right.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu allinta uyarikun.
I’m not worthy of anything	Manam imapaqpas hinachu kani
That's a lot of it.	Chayqa achkatam chaypi kachkan.
I am very sorry about that	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni
There’s no second chance.	Manam iskay kaq chansa kanchu.
Now I was really angry	Kunanqa chiqamanta phiñasqa karqani
I think someone is sick	Pipas unqusqa kasqanmantam piensani
I would be good all the time	Tukuy tiempo allinmi kayman
I was going to do it proud	Ñoqaqa orgulloso ruwanaypaqmi karqani
I know what you want	Yachanim ima munasqaykita
I can’t ignore it	Manam mana uyariyta atiymanchu
It was a new thing.	Chayqa musuq kaqmi karqa.
If this person is important to you then .	Sichus kay runa qampaq importante chaymanta .
I wish he hadn't done this	Munaymanmi kaytaqa mana ruwaptinqa
I am a human being like you.	Ñuqapas qam hinam runa kani.
He was not here yesterday or today.	Payqa manam qayna punchawchu nitaq kunan punchawchu kaypi karqa.
But I couldn’t do anything about it	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
I have no idea what he thinks	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu ima piensasqanmanta
I knew it was there	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqanmanta
Maximize the window.	Ventanata aswan hatun ruway.
Tell me everything.	Tukuy imata willaway.
I want to be here	Kaypi kayta munani
It was the most important thing to do	Aswan importante ruwaymi karqan
I wasn’t bad, he said	Manam mana allinchu karqani, nispas nin
Glad he's gone.	Kusisqam payqa manaña kasqanmanta.
I felt like it wasn't that bad	Manam chayna mana allinchu karqa nispaymi tarikurqani
I never knew he would be like that.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna runa kananta.
I don't know what happened at that time	Chay tiempopi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam yachanichu
We have a lot of people with us.	Achka runakunam ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
I'd be fine	Allinmi kayman
I didn’t know what he meant	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta
I’m not a very good person	Manam ancha allin runachu kani
Such a good thing.	Chayna allin kaq.
I didn’t want to see that	Manam chaytaqa qawayta munarqanichu
I always thought this was bigger	Sapa kutim piensarqani kayqa aswan hatun kasqanmanta
That was not an easy task.	Chayqa manan facil ruwaychu karqan.
I can’t get out either	Ñuqapas manam lluqsiyta atinichu
You're right.	Qamqa chiqaptam.
I don’t want it to matter to me	Manam munanichu ñuqapaq importante kananpaq
He came to the table.	Payqa hamurqa.
But where is it?.	Ichaqa, ¿maypitaq kachkan?.
I wonder how he knew that	Tapukuni imaynatataq chayta yacharqa nispa
This thing is good.	Kay imapas allinmi.
I felt really uncomfortable	Chiqaptam mana allintachu tarikurqani
But he never does that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
So far it looks good though.	Kunankamaqa allinmi rikchakun ichaqa.
He wants to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munan.
That’s all there was to it	Chayllam chaypi karqa
The worst thing about that.	Chaymanta aswan mana allinqa.
I really wanted to get out of there	Anchatam munarqani chaymanta lluqsiyta
I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I didn't think there was anything wrong with that	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi imapas mana allin kasqanta
I hadn’t seen him before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa paytaqa rikurqanichu
I thought hard about that for a while	Chaypin huk tiempo sinchita yuyaykurqani
They really had no idea.	Chiqamanta mana ima yuyayniyuq karqanku.
A good and strong school.	Allin hinaspa sinchi yachay wasi.
He didn't know how much time had passed.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a tiempo pasasqanmantaqa.
I can’t talk to anyone	Manam piwanpas rimayta atinichu
He wasn’t alone in it.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chaypi kasharqan.
That means you can sleep.	Chayqa niyta munan puñuyta atisqaykita.
I still wasn’t sure what the truth was.	Manaraqmi segurochu karqani ima chiqap kasqanmantaqa.
A strong one.	Huk sinchi kaq.
I didn't do much more than that	Manam chaymantaqa aswan achkatam ruwarqani
I didn’t know he had any real intentions	Manam yacharqanichu chiqap yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I hope this is something you are ready to do	Suyachkani kayqa imapas ruwanaykipaq listo kasqaykita
I can’t do without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam ruwaymanchu.
I knew all this a long time ago	Tukuy chaykunataqa unayñam yacharqani
I want to know the truth	Cheqaq kaqta yachayta munani
Learn something new every day.	Sapa punchaw imapas musuq yachay.
It didn’t matter anymore	Manañam imananpaschu karqa
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Manam ima kasqanmantaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
He didn’t have to do that at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas chayta ruwananchu karqan.
And that makes three.	Hinaspa chaymi kimsa ruwan.
I think you’re very sad right now	Yuyaykuni kunanpacha ancha llakisqa kasqaykita
But you can’t talk.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t want anyone to know about it	Manam munarqanichu chaymanta pipas yachananta
Last night was that night.	Qayna tutaqa chay tutam karqa.
He had driven her away.	Payqa payta qarqusqa.
I doubt it very much	Anchatam iskayrayani
I didn’t want to see him.	Manam paytaqa rikuyta munarqanichu.
I can't speak now	Kunanqa manam rimayta atinichu
This was one of them	Kayqa hukninmi karqa
I didn't want to hold it that long	Manam chayna unaytachu hapiyta munarqani
He didn't really know what.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imamanta.
Maybe I can do something for you	Ichapas qampaq imatapas ruwayta atiyman
That secret is certain with me.	Chay pakasqa kaqmi ñoqawanqa seguro kashan.
I wanted to get out of there	Chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqani
I mean if you do stupid things all the time	Niyta munani sichus sapa kutilla sonso ruwaykunata ruwanki chayqa
I couldn’t believe him	Manam paytaqa creeyta atirqanichu
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Ichapas mana chayta ruwananchu.
Or about three.	Utaq yaqa kimsa.
I knew you really wanted something like that	Yacharqanim chayna kaqta anchata munasqaykita
More often than not, I feel ugly about being pretty	Aswan sapa kutim millay tarikuni sumaq rikchayniyuq kaymanta
I didn’t know anything	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu
I want to tell you everything	Tukuy imatam willayta munani
I don’t know how, but we did it right	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta, ichaqa allinta ruwarqayku
I’m pretty sure of that	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa seguro kani
That would have been nice.	Chayna kaptinqa sumaqmi kanman karqa.
Another reality.	Huk chiqap kaq.
There is nothing like that	Chay hinaqa manan imapas kanchu
That he didn’t have to do that.	Mana chayta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
Anything but what he had to do.	Imapas ichaqa ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
The other people.	Huknin runakuna.
I didn’t want to be alone again	Manam hukmanta sapallay kayta munarqanichu
I really want to do that.	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta.
It felt like a few hours in the morning.	Iskay kimsa hora tutamanta hinam tarikurqa.
I hope it’s a good night	Suyachkani allin tuta kananta
I really had no idea what he was going to do	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani ima ruwananta
I heard he wasn't there	Uyarirqanim mana chaypi kasqanmanta
I was very happy with that.	Chaywanmi ancha kusisqa karqani.
We did that last night.	Chaytaqa qayna tutam ruwarqayku.
I think that’s great	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensani
So, go ahead.	Chaymi, riy.
I know this must be hard for you	Yachanim kayqa qampaq sinchi kanan kasqanmanta
I have no idea he didn’t want to	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani mana munasqanmanta
Do what he wants you to do.	Munasqanman hina ruway.
I mean, how.	Niyta munani, imaynata.
And then he did it again frantically and quickly.	Hinaspa chaymanta hukmanta ruwarqa mancharisqa hinaspa utqaylla.
This process didn’t really do it.	Kay ruwayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
I would like this to happen	Munaymanmi kay pasananta
He’s very, very sick sometimes.	Payqa ancha, ancha unqusqa wakin kuti.
I don’t see it anywhere	Manam maypipas rikunichu
I think they were scared	Yuyaykuni mancharisqa kasqankuta
I don’t want to say it, but he’s a great guy.	Manam niyta munanichu, ichaqa hatun runam.
But I hadn’t thought of that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
The latter was the truth.	Kay qhepa kaqmi cheqaq kaq karqan.
I know what will happen	Yachanim imakuna pasananta
I mean, everybody knows about it.	Niyta munani, tukuy runa chaymanta yachanku.
I know you can't help it	Yachanim mana yanapayta atisqaykita
He looked at the money.	Payqa qullqita qhawarisqa.
No one knows who he is.	Manam pipas yachanchu pi kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Ichapas mana karqachu.
I don't know if he was afraid or worried about her	Manam yachanichu paymanta manchakusqanmanta icha llakisqa kasqanmantaqa
But that is not difficult.	Ichaqa manan sasachu chayqa.
You can’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atiwaqchu.
But, that’s what we did.	Ichaqa, chaytam ruwarqayku.
It's time.	Tiempo kan.
If so, which.	Chayna kaptinqa, mayqin.
You’re a man.	Qam runa.
It has never been this difficult.	Manam haykapipas kayna sasachu karqa.
So it’s almost like that.	Chaymi yaqa chayna.
I've never been able to do that	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I never remember it.	Manam haykapipas yuyarinichu.
He wants that to happen.	Payqa chaytam munan.
That was always the case.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqa.
It might be there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi kanman.
I want to see him again	Hukmanta payta rikuyta munani
I knew what was coming	Yacharqanim imakuna hamunanta
So, there you have it.	Chaymi, chaypiqa kanki.
Maybe half an hour.	Ichapas kuskan hora.
He, however, could be late.	Paymi ichaqa tardeta chayayta atinman karqan.
I had an unconscious mind	Mana yuyayniyuq yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I knew what that was like	Yacharqanim chay imayna kasqanmanta
Second, this is not true.	Iskay kaq, kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
Ready for anything.	Imapaqpas listoña.
A really smart kid.	Chiqap yachaysapa wawa.
I didn’t want him to know that	Manam munarqanichu chayta yachananta
He’ll be sick.	Unqusqa kanqa.
I don’t know any other way.	Manam huk ñanta yachanichu.
Or tell me something.	Utaq imatapas willaway.
It’s not such a big deal.	Manam chayna hatun ruwaychu.
We are together tonight.	Kunan tutam kuska kachkaniku.
I can’t go there anymore	Manañam chaymanqa riyta atiymanchu
I had to do it fast.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwanay karqan.
That was the first thing he learned about it.	Chaytan ñawpaqtaqa chaymanta yacharqan.
Maybe I want to help	Ichapas yanapayta munani
But then he was fired.	Ichaqa chaymantam qarqusqa karqa.
Obviously, he’s not.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan chay hinachu.
And that’s how it felt.	Hinaspa chayna tarikurqa.
It wasn't that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu karqa.
I don’t feel angry	Manam phiñasqa hinachu tarikuni
I feel so much better.	Ancha allintam sientekuni.
He was very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
I had no idea what was wrong	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
The world itself.	Kikin kay pacha.
I think you’ve done really well	Chiqamanta allinta ruwasqaykita yuyani
I didn’t want to see her again	Manam hukmanta rikuyta munarqanichu
Something really important.	Imapas chiqap importante kaq.
He was here to stay.	Payqa kaypim karqa.
The truth about that is here.	Chaymanta chiqap kaqmi kaypi kachkan.
I can’t believe it’s him	Mana creeyta atiymanchu pay kasqanmanta
He knew this was true.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa cheqaq kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t figure it out	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
He always wanted to know more.	Payqa sapa kutim astawan yachayta munarqa.
Therefore, this is not a good thing.	Chayraykum kayqa mana allinchu.
So it was there.	Chaymi chaypi karqa.
I thought you were amazing	Admirakuypaqmi kasqaykita piensarqani
Another person, someone.	Huk runa, pitapas.
It's like a process.	Chayqa huk ruway hinam.
I wasn’t quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I'll go to him tomorrow	Paqarinmi payta risaq
I didn’t want it or want it	Manam munarqanichu nitaq munarqanichu
I'm hoping this is bad	Kaytaqa mana allintam suyachkani
I hope you will do it again soon	Suyachkani chaylla yapamanta ruwanaykita
He couldn’t have been more helpful.	Payqa manan aswan yanapayta atinmanchu karqan.
He doesn’t like them.	Payqa manan chaykunataqa gustanchu.
I felt like I did.	Ñuqapas ñuqa hinam tarikurqani.
I can't believe he's gone	Manam creeyta atinichu manaña kasqanmanta
I never will either	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas ruwasaqchu
Such an approach would do just that.	Chayna ruwayqa chaynatam ruwanman.
I usually dismiss them	Yaqa llapanpim chaykunataqa mana allinpaq hapini
At night, in the morning, in the morning.	Tuta, tutamanta, tutamanta.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam allinchu karqa.
I wish I could have left	Munaymanmi karqan ripuyta
I thought it would be good there	Chaypiqa allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
I could not cope with all of this	Tukuy chaykunataqa manam atipayta atirqanichu
And that’s what he meant.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munarqa.
I am really happy to be here	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani kaypi kasqaymanta
I know exactly what needs to be done	Allintam yachani imakuna ruwana kasqanmanta
There’s a .	Chaypim kan.
I wonder if he’s alone.	Sapallanchu kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I don’t do much anymore.	Manañam anchatachu ruwani.
He did so, but without success.	Chaytan ruwarqan, ichaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
I just learned how to ride a bike	Chayraqmi bicicletapi puriyta yacharqani
Well and truly I was there	Allinmi hinaspa chiqaptam chaypi karqani
I can’t wait to hear from you	Manam suyayta atiymanchu qammanta uyariyta
I don't care where it is.	Manam maypi kasqanmantaqa imananpaschu.
I knew what was right.	Yacharqanim ima allin kasqanta.
Who could have spoken.	Pitaq rimayta atinman karqan.
The former would do well.	Ñawpaq kaqmi allinta ruwanman.
I don’t believe anything.	Manam imatapas creenichu.
I knew he was too drunk to swim	Yacharqanim llumpay machasqa kasqanmanta, chaymi mana nadayta atirqachu
I was never good anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam haykapipas allinchu karqani
Being out here.	Kay hawapi kaspa.
The first two things.	Ñawpaq kaq iskay imakuna.
I wanted to tell you something	Imatapas willayta munarqani
He was in deep distress.	Payqa sinchitan hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
Not for any reason.	Ni imaraykupas.
I had to act faster	Aswan utqayllam imatapas ruwanay karqa
I mean, yeah, everybody knows	Niyta munani, arí, tukuy runa yachanku
But I can't find a good way to do this	Ichaqa manan allin ñanta tarinichu kayta ruwanaypaq
Then again last night.	Chaymanta yapamanta qayna tuta.
A whole new world for me	Huk musuq pacha ñuqapaq
I know this is serious	Yachanim kayqa serio kasqanmanta
I was in a good mood	Allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani
Maybe it was the real thing.	Ichapas chiqap kaq karqa.
I mean it’s you.	Qam kasqaykita niyta munani.
But I want him back with me	Ichaqa munani ñoqawan kutimunanta
I never remember them anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam haykapipas chaykunataqa yuyarinichu
I wasn’t sure what his real name was	Manam segurochu karqani ima chiqap sutin kasqanmanta
I couldn’t focus on it	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I wouldn't be here without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam kaypichu kayman.
It should be a good time!.	¡Allin pacha kanan!.
I thought about that most of the night	Chaypiqa yaqa llapan tutam piensarqani
And so it went on.	Hinaspa chaynata rirqa.
Obviously, this is a difficult task.	Sut’inmi, kayqa sasa ruwaymi.
The child of the night	Tutamanta wawa
He is a wonderful man.	Payqa huk sumaq runam.
Or two or three.	Utaq iskay kimsa.
I look forward to telling the final story	Qhipa willakuyta willayta suyachkani
I couldn't do anything about it	Chaywanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
There is no such thing as.	Manam kanchu nispa.
He was young, maybe thirty.	Payqa wayna kasqa, ichapas kimsa chunka.
It won’t be easy.	Manan facilchu kanqa.
One of them has to go.	Hukninmi rinan.
It is still there today	Kunankamapas chaypim kachkan
But it wasn’t that bad.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu mana allinchu karqan.
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He’s alone.	Sapallanmi.
I knew it was coming anyway	Yacharqanim imayna kaptinpas hamunanta
These are the old people.	Kaykunaqa ñawpaq runakunam.
Something really.	Imapas chiqap.
I like it better.	Aswan allintam gustan.
No thanks or anything.	Mana gracias nitaq imapas.
He doesn’t care anymore.	Payqa manañan imananpaschu.
He said he didn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan nispas nin.
It’s not a human being.	Manam runachu.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.
That’s going to be a lot harder.	Chayqa aswan sasa kanqa.
You are part of it.	Qamqa chaymantam kanki.
I hope at the end of the summer	Suyachkani chiri killa tukukuypi
So this is part of that.	Chaymi kayqa chaymanta huknin.
I wanted to get out of there too	Ñuqapas chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqani
I was blissfully drunk all the while	Tukuy chay pacha kusisqa machasqa karqani
I knew you were unhappy	Yacharqanim mana kusisqa kasqaykita
That lasted about a month.	Chayqa yaqa huk killa hinam karqa.
I wanted to tell you about him	Paymanta willayta munarqani
I have no idea what this is about	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imamantataq kayqa rimachkan
A little scared that he shouldn't be.	Huk chikan mancharisqa mana kananmanta.
I still couldn’t figure out why.	Manaraqmi yachayta atirqanichu imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
I can’t be this person	Manam kay runa kayta atiymanchu
No one there wants to see it now.	Chaypiqa manam pipas kunanqa qawayta munanchu.
There was nothing I could do about what happened	Chay pasasqanmantaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
That who, what, why.	Chay pi, ima, imarayku.
This is good for me right now.	Kayqa allinmi ñuqapaq kunanpacha.
I feel the same way he does	Ñoqapas pay hinan sientekuni
There was a lot going on there, it seemed.	Chaypiqa achka ruwaymi karqa, chaymi rikchakurqa.
There was nothing I could do about it	Chaypaqqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
This shouldn’t be the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
In fact, he probably did.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqa.
I couldn’t be here anymore	Manañam kaypi kayta atirqanichu
And we walked together.	Hinaspa kuska puriq kayku.
Do the job of the job.	Chay llamkayta ruway.
Or that’s it.	Utaq chayta.
This is not a good thing	Kayqa manam allinchu
I think he is right	Payqa allintam rimachkan, nispaymi piensani
He didn’t know how to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta yacharqanchu.
Actually, I mean that	Chiqaptaqa chaytam niyta munani
I don’t want to know who he is.	Manam munanichu pi kasqanmanta yachayta.
They were not here tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam kaypichu karqaku.
Learn from the experience.	Chay pasasqanmanta yachay.
I want to be right	Allinmi kayta munani
I make a movie.	Huk peliculata ruwani.
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
Not anymore, he says.	Manañam, nispas nin.
From what he knows.	Yachasqanmanta.
I can't help it now	Kunanqa manam yanapayta atiymanchu
I think you’ll be happy	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kanki
It happened about once a month.	Killapi huk kutita hinam chayna pasarqa.
I immediately told him to stop being silly	Chayllam nirqani amaña mana yuyayniyuq kananpaq
I didn’t want to help	Manam yanapayta munarqanichu
There are people here.	Kaypiqa runakunam kachkan.
If he had been.	Sichus payqa karqan chayqa.
I didn't think it was that bad	Manam piensarqanichu chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
If there is nothing, there is nothing.	Mana imapas kaptinqa, manam kanchu.
And next weekend.	Hinaspa hamuq semana tukukuypi.
It came out a lot.	Anchatam lluqsirqa.
I have no idea what happened	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
I can’t let this happen	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atiymanchu
Someone had to be there for him.	Pipas paypaq chaypi kanan karqan.
Please, please.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa.
But first, a little background.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa, huk chikan ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
I didn’t listen to him	Manam paytaqa uyarirqanichu
But that’s the reality.	Ichaqa chaymi cheqaq kaq.
I didn’t hear him so he did it again	Manam uyarirqanichu chaymi hukmanta ruwarqa
But I couldn’t see it	Ichaqa manan rikuyta atirqanichu
Something was very wrong.	Imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
Now, that will do.	Kunanqa, chaymi ruwanqa.
You know how to get there.	Chayman chayayta yachanki.
Now I like this guy	Kunanqa kay runam gustan
You said that the other day.	Chaynatam huk punchaw nirqanki.
He wasn’t what he wanted.	Payqa manan munasqanman hinachu karqan.
Do the same thing again.	Chaynata yapamanta ruway.
I cannot describe this but it is amazing	Kaytaqa manam willayta atiymanchu ichaqa admirakuypaqmi
The same stupid stuff.	Chay kikin sonso imakuna.
I really want to help	Anchatam yanapayta munani
For now, maybe.	Kunankamaqa, ichapas.
I think you are too	Qampas chayna kasqaykita yuyani
Something no one can really predict.	Imapas mana pipas chiqaptapuni willayta atinchu.
I just didn’t want to talk about it	Chaylla mana chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
I know that it is not	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
In fact, they are really good.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin allin kanku.
But there is no one	Ichaqa manan pipas kanchu
He was a very good player.	Payqa ancha allin pukllaqmi karqan.
I couldn’t take it anymore	Manañan chayta hap’iyta atirqanichu
I didn’t want to stop him	Manam harkayta munarqanichu
All right, all right, he says.	Allin, allin, nispas nin.
I know exactly what it is like	Allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta
Everyone wants something.	Lliwmi imatapas munanku.
I saw it all, but I wasn’t here	Tukuy chayta rikurqani, ichaqa mana kaypichu karqani
This is the first step.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi.
I hope he is innocent.	Suyachkani mana huchayoq kananpaq.
I think that is something else	Chayqa huk imapas kasqanmantam piensani
I didn’t see him in the car	Manam paytaqa rikurqanichu chay carropi
Thirty times a month for two months.	Kimsa chunka kutita killapi iskay killa.
What is the probability?.	¿Imataq kanman?.
I can’t talk about this anymore	Manañam kaymantaqa rimayta atiymanchu
I don’t believe it now	Manam kunanqa creenichu
I always enjoyed walking	Sapa kutim kusisqa puriq kani
I wanted him to be.	Paytaqa munarqani.
I didn’t want to talk about him	Manam paymanta rimayta munarqanichu
He refused to sing it.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chayta takiyta.
I’m that good at it.	Ñuqaqa chayna allinmi kani.
Now I know this will never work	Kunanqa yachanim kayqa mana haykapipas allinta ruwananta
I didn’t really know what it was going to be like	Manam allintachu yacharqani imayna kananta
He has been there for two years now.	Kunanqa iskay watañam chaypi kachkan.
And he's sort of right.	Hinaspa payqa huk laya allintam rimachkan.
But this is worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
You need to take the easiest way.	Aswan facil ñanta ruwanayki tiyan.
There was nothing without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam imapas karqachu.
It really wasn't that bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu karqa.
Yes, he is right.	Arí, payqa allintam nin.
You are not a bad person.	Manam millay runachu kanki.
He is happier than ever.	Payqa aswan kusisqa kachkan.
I didn’t want to think about it, right now	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta munarqanichu, kunanpacha
I want to know what’s wrong with him	Paywan ima mana allin kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I haven’t been this happy in a long time	Unayñan mana kay hina kusisqachu kani
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanmi ichaqa mana chayna segurochu karqa.
I can't stand to see him anymore	Manañam aguantayta atinichu payta qawayta
I am not sure why	Manam segurochu kani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
Okay so here's the problem.	Allinmi chaymi kaypi kachkan chay sasachakuy.
I want to know more about it	Chaymanta astawan yachayta munani
You’re not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkanki.
But he was hungry.	Ichaqa yarqasqa kasqa.
I don’t have time to do this right now	Kunanqa manan tiempoy kanchu kayta ruwanaypaq
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Yuyaykuni hatun, hatun ruway kanman.
That won’t do any good.	Chayqa manan imapipas allintachu ruwanqa.
I didn’t try too hard	Manam anchatachu kallpanchakurqani
I'm just so worried.	Chayllam ancha llakisqa kachkani.
I was a little disappointed	Huk chhikantan hukmanyasqa karqani
It’s a very easy thing to do.	Ancha facil ruwaymi.
The following year.	Qatiqnin wata.
I want it like nothing else	Mana imapas hinam munani
But he knows that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa yachanmi manaña chayna kasqanmantaqa.
This is worse than anything.	Kayqa imamantapas aswan mana allinmi.
He was never there.	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa karqachu.
Learn why it is.	Imarayku chayta yachay.
I need to do this, to do it on a regular basis	Kayta ruwanay tiyan, sapa kuti ruwanaypaq
A couple of times, maybe	Huk iskay kutita, ichapas
I told him several times not to do it	Achka kutitam nirqani mana ruwananpaq
We did that really well.	Chaytaqa chiqap allintam ruwarqayku.
He was arrested now.	Payqa kunanmi hapisqa karqa.
It's really cold today.	Chiqaptam kunan punchawqa chiri kachkan.
All of them, in fact.	Llapallankum, chiqaptaqa.
That month.	Chay killa.
A pretty big crowd, for sure.	Huk sumaq hatun achka runakuna, seguro.
I never felt like I was very smart.	Manam haykapipas ancha yachaysapa hinachu tarikurqani.
I didn’t know that before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
I never got to ask.	Manam haykapipas tapuyta atirqanichu.
Everyone knows how that happens.	Lliwmi yachanku imayna chayna kasqanmanta.
It’s a very big deal about it.	Ancha hatunmi chaymanta.
Not yet at least.	Manaraqmi aswanpas.
This is the biggest problem.	Kaymi aswan hatun sasachakuy.
Why they seemed so upset.	Imaraykutaq ancha llakisqa hina karqanku.
But I never thought you would actually do that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanichu cheqaqtapuni chayta ruwanaykita
I didn’t think much of it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu yuyaykurqani
But nothing was this bad.	Ichaqa manan imapas kay hina mana allinchu karqan.
Yes, he wanted to.	Arí, payqa munarqanmi.
Things were very wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
No, he wasn’t really.	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu payqa karqan.
I can’t remember which year.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu mayqin wata.
I certainly didn’t want to.	Cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanichu.
Maybe an hour or two.	Ichapas huk utaq iskay hora.
I can’t stop it	Manam harkayta atiymanchu
I just learned that	Chayllaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani
I can't talk to anyone about this	Kaymantaqa manam piwanpas rimayta atiymanchu
Something that really makes sense.	Imapas chiqap yuyayniyuq kaq.
You probably already knew that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa yacharqanki.
I know what happened	Yachanim imapas pasasqanmanta
Very, very tired.	Ancha, ancha sayk’usqa.
How do you do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwanki.
Seriously, that’s what he says.	Serio, chaytam nin.
He's doing better, you know.	Payqa aswan allintam ruwachkan, yachanki.
No, that’s a good thing.	Manan, chayqa allinmi.
I don't remember that	Chaytaqa manam yuyarinichu
I haven’t heard from him in a long time	Unayñan mana paymanta uyarirqanichu
I know you will do this	Yachanim kayta ruwanaykita
I think he’s really hurt	Yuyaykuni chiqaptapuni k’irisqa kasqanmanta
I can't stop this anymore	Manañam kayta harkayta atiymanchu
No, not probably.	Manan, manan ichapas.
I think it would be good	Allinmi kanman nispaymi
I still feel that way	Kunankamapas chaynatam sientekuni
I knew something good would happen	Yacharqanim imapas allin pasananta
But there was nothing I could do	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
Now that makes sense.	Kunanqa chay ruwayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
Maybe you’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki.
I didn’t want to be with anyone	Manam piwanpas kaytaqa munarqanichu
I am so happy to be here	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaypi kasqaymanta
Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí, arí.
You can’t stay with me.	Manan ñoqawan qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t mean, you know, like that	Manam niyta munarqanichu, yachanki, chaynata
Several times in fact.	Achka kutita chiqaptaqa.
So he was always there.	Chaymi haykapipas chaypi karqa.
Perhaps he does.	Yaqapaschá payqa chayta ruwan.
I never heard of this before	Manam haykapipas kaymantaqa uyarirqanichu
I don’t want to be that person, anyway	Manam chay runa kayta munanichu, imayna kaptinpas
I think he was worried about me	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta llakisqa kasqanmanta
But he refused to ask.	Ichaqa manan tapuyta munarqanchu.
I can't believe it happens so fast, but it's wonderful.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu chayna utqaylla pasananta, ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
So far, it's not a good thing.	Kunankamaqa manam allinchu kachkan.
I wasn’t really there	Manam chiqaptaqa chaypichu karqani
That he was so lonely.	Chayna sapallan kasqanmanta.
I hope to go there one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw chayman riyta.
I was there, that day	Chaypim karqani, chay punchaw
I want to get a job somewhere	Maypipas llamkayta tariyta munani
I never thought much about the future.	Manam haykapipas hamuq tiempopi anchatachu piensarqani.
To be unrealistic.	Mana chiqap kananpaq.
Now? 	Kunan?
Here was a chance.	Kaypiqa huk chansa karqa.
I thought you might as well	Yuyarqanim qampas chayna kanman
It cost me about ten bucks.	Yaqa chunka qullqita quwarqa.
So he’s crazy, so you’re crazy.	Chaymi payqa loco, chaymi qamqa loco kanki.
But that’s just me.	Ichaqa chayqa ñuqallam.
You have to make a play here.	Kaypiqa huk pukllayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I actually wasn’t there	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypichu karqani
There is a third person involved.	Kimsa kaq runam chaypi kachkan.
I don't think he really knows.	Manam piensanichu chiqaptapuni yachan.
They were furious.	Paykunaqa sinchi phiñasqa karqanku.
Why can’t we play like that.	¿Imanasqataq mana chaynata pukllayta atichwanchu.
I couldn’t remember.	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu.
I felt proud that day	Chay punchawmi orgulloso tarikurqani
They have been in prison for a long time.	Unayñan carcelpi kashanku.
I am not a bad person	Manam millay runachu kani
I feel so much better now!	¡Kunanqa ancha allinmi sientekuni!
But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanayki.
I have nowhere else to go	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq kanchu
I couldn’t have done it	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu karqa
I was angry and.	Phiñasqa karqani hinaspa.
He sounds like a good guy.	Payqa allin runa hinam uyarikun.
I mean like a human being	Runa hinam niyta munani
But I don’t think so.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu yuyaykuni.
So that’s how it all came out.	Chaymi chayna tukuy imapas lluqsirqa.
I can’t wait to hear it every morning	Manam suyayta atinichu sapa paqarin uyariyta
I barely saw anything	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikurqanichu
There I am, now.	Chaypim kachkani, kunanqa.
I heard everything.	Tukuy imatam uyarirqani.
I just couldn’t do it	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu
Yes, that was twenty years ago.	Arí, chayqa iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I can't work for you	Manam qampaq llamkayta atiymanchu
But that was never the case.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
Yes, he says.	Arí nispas nin.
I don’t really know what’s going to happen.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imakuna kananta.
And then you have to do it right.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa allintam ruwanayki.
I still didn't know who he was.	Hinallam mana yacharqanichu pi kasqanmanta.
I think he didn’t want to talk anymore	Yuyaykuni manaña rimayta munasqanmanta
No, it doesn’t exist as of now.	Manan, kunan hinaqa manan kanchu.
You did it again tonight, you know.	Kunan tuta yapamanta ruwarqanki, yachanki.
He didn’t know how good it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna allin kasqanta.
I just can’t wait any longer	Chaylla manaña suyayta atinichu
I have to do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwanay.

He would never have wanted this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kayta munanmanchu karqan.
I know how smart you are	Yachanim imayna yachaysapa kasqaykita
I think, perhaps, it should be too much	Yuyaykuni, ichapas, llumpay kanan
I want to say one more person.	Huk runa astawan niyta munani.
I think it is anyway	Imayna kaptinpas kasqanmantam piensani
I still haven't done that.	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
There is nothing that such a person can do	Chayna runaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinchu
I wasn’t sure how crazy you were	Manam segurochu karqani imayna loco kasqaykita
You have to act fast.	Usqhaylla ruwanayki tiyan.
I want to know what that is	Imataq chay kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I didn’t notice him	Manam paytaqa repararqanichu
But one problem after another.	Ichaqa huk sasachakuymanta hukmanta.
I knew there was a though	Yacharqanim huk ichaqa kasqanmanta
I can't look at him anymore	Manañam paytaqa qawayta atinichu
I couldn’t see anyone	Manam pitapas rikuyta atirqanichu
He has been gone for twenty years.	Iskay chunka watañam manaña kanchu.
I never saw him want anything like that.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chaynata imatapas munasqanmanta.
But it couldn’t have been better.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu kanman karqan.
I have no idea what to do about it.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imata ruwanaypaq chaymantaqa.
I mean after all, it could always be worse	Niyta munani tukuy imamanta, sapa kuti aswan mana allin kanman
I don’t think that will happen in the future	Hamuq tiempopi mana chayna kananta yuyaykuni
I would be the wise one	Ñuqam chay yachaysapa kayman
I was so tired and hungry	Ancha sayk’usqañan karqani yarqaymanta
I want to be happy again	Hukmanta kusisqa kaytam munani
Would be better anywhere.	Maypipas aswan allinmi kanman.
No, please don’t.	Manan, ama hina kaspa.

No one wants that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas munanchu.
I couldn’t understand what was going on with him	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu paywan imakuna pasasqanmanta
A cup of coffee is fine	Huk kukata allinmi
If you think it’s funny, good for you.	Sichus asikunapaq hina kananpaq yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi qanpaq.
It’s just me ever.	Ñuqallam haykapipas.
But he never does.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
He wasn’t there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kasharqan.
I wonder how that could be he thought	Tapukuni imaynataq chay kanman pay yuyaykurqan
I am a rich man.	Ñuqaqa qhapaq runam kani.
He wasn’t like you.	Payqa manan qan hinachu karqan.
It was a very impressive experience.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I didn’t want to know more.	Manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
Being the future.	Hamuq pacha kay.
Learn to do it right and do it for yourself.	Allinta ruwayta yachay hinaspa qampaq ruway.
I have nothing really to say	Manam imatapas chiqaptapuni rimanaypaq kanchu
I wish him all the best for his success	Allin kananpaqmi tukuy allin kaqta munani
I don’t like that at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas gustanchu.
Perhaps they were.	Ichapas paykunaqa karqaku.
I have decided to do the same	Ñoqapas chaynata ruwanaypaqmi tantearuni
Foolish, like me	Mana yuyayniyuq, ñuqa hina
People know about it.	Runakunaqa chaymantam yachanku.
Tell him where it will be.	Willay maypi kananta.
The same is less than nothing and more than nothing.	Kaqmi mana imamanta aswan pisi, mana imamanta aswan.
The bigger the better.	Aswan hatunmi aswan allin.
Like a child, he was.	Huk wawa hinam, payqa karqa.
But here's why that's not true.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkan imarayku chayna mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
I don’t know him	Manam riqsinichu
Now that’s crazy.	Kunanqa chaymi loco.
You are no longer safe.	Qamqa manañam allinchu kachkanki.
You don’t know what he’s feeling tonight.	Mana yachankichu kunan tuta ima sientekusqanmanta.
I want to be angry	Phiñasqa kaytam munani
He took it seriously.	Chaytaqa allintan qhawarirqan.
This is what I mean.	Kaymi ñuqapa niyta munan.
Now, he couldn't do anything about that.	Kunanqa, manan chaytaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
It was about half an hour later.	Yaqa kuskan hora qhepamanmi karqan.
But it goes beyond that.	Ichaqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi.
I didn’t mean it that way.	Manam chaynatachu niyta munarqani.
I really hope it’s good	Chiqamanta suyachkani allin kananta
But I can’t hear it at all	Ichaqa manan imapipas uyariyta atinichu
I’ve never seen that either	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa rikurqanichu
And then some.	Hinaspa chaymanta wakin.
I didn't think much of it	Chaypiqa manam anchatachu piensarqani
So maybe you do too!.	Chaymi ichapas qampas ruwanki!.
I couldn't tell you this	Kaytaqa manam willayta atirqanichu
I can't remember now	Kunanqa manam yuyariyta atinichu
He told me that it was.	Paymi niwarqa chayna kasqanmanta.
A strange world out there.	Huk mana riqsisqa pacha chay hawapi.
At least it couldn’t be worse.	Aswanpas manan aswan mana allinchu kanman.
I think about it every night and day	Chaypin sapa tuta p’unchay yuyaykuni
No one knows what’s going to happen.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus pasananta.
I know he is lonely	Yachanim sapallan kasqanmanta
I was so glad he did this	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani kayta ruwasqanmanta
That is what man must do.	Chaytan runaqa ruwanan.
I hope he knows what he’s doing	Suyachkani ima ruwasqanmanta yachananta
I could hardly hear them	Chaykunataqa yaqapaschá mana uyariyta atirqanichu
I couldn't win like he did	Pay hinaqa manam atipayta atirqanichu
He would rather be anywhere than here.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman maypipas kaypi kaymantaqa.
Okay, he's right, that was kind of nice.	Allinmi, payqa allintam nin, chayqa huk laya sumaqmi karqa.
I think that’s a good thing	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni
It's just not worth it.	Chaylla mana valenchu ​​kayta.
He knew now that he would.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqan chayta ruwananta.
I always feel that way.	Sapa kutim chayna sientekuni.
I really don't understand.	Chiqaptaqa manam entiendenichu.
If there was ever a time.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas huk tiempo karqan chayqa.
I didn't want to play this game anymore	Manañam kay pukllayta pukllayta munarqanichu
He wouldn’t want to.	Payqa manan munanmanchu.

I couldn’t sleep anymore	Manañam puñuyta atirqanichu
That’s what you want, right.	Chaynatam munanki, ¿aw.
I want to go tomorrow	Paqarin riyta munani
I'm holding him.	Payta hapini.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
I didn’t want to play again	Manam hukmanta pukllayta munarqanichu
But no one knows what will happen.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu imachus kananta.
And do it yourself.	Hinaspa kikin ruway.
I want to know what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I can’t say where.	Manam niyta atiymanchu maypi.
I wasn’t really sure	Manam chiqaptachu seguro karqani
Everyone there was happy.	Chaypi llapallankum kusisqa karqaku.
I was wrong, like really wrong.	Pantasqa karqani, chiqap pantasqa hina.
I couldn’t let him go crazy	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu loco hina ripunanpaq
I didn’t do it now.	Manam kunanqa ruwarqanichu.
That sounds serious.	Chayqa serio hinam uyarikun.
I’ve seen that happen a few times	Chaytaqa iskay kinsa kutitan rikurqani
No one is here long.	Manam pipas unaytachu kaypi kachkan.
I never get an answer	Manam haykapipas kutichiyta tarinichu
That means duality.	Chayqa iskay kaytam niyta munan.
I could never figure out why.	Manam haykapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Not yet actually	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa
No, they didn’t agree at all.	Manan, manan ni imapipas acuerdopichu karqanku.
He meant it though.	Payqa ichaqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
You’re the one, you’re not.	Qamqa kanki, manam.
There is a way.	Kanmi huk imayna.
I don't understand what the problem is	Manam entiendenichu ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta
Yes, you know right.	Arí, allintam yachanki.
All day today, no.	Tukuy punchaw kunan punchaw, manam.
One of them wanted to ask.	Hukninmi tapuyta munarqa.
I didn’t know much about him either	Ñuqapas manam anchatachu paymanta yacharqani
That’s why he’s doing this.	Chayraykum kayta ruwachkan.
He had it a long time ago.	Payqa unayñan chayta hap’isqa.
No, it won’t be.	Manan, manan kanqachu.
I thought it was beautiful	Sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani

Someone, or whatever that may be.	Pipas, icha imapas chay kaptinpas.
Does anyone know how to do this?.	¿Pipas yachanchu kayta ruwananpaq?.
I couldn’t stop thinking about it	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta saqiyta atirqanichu

I was so surprised how busy he was	Anchatan admirakurqani imayna ocupasqa kasqanmanta
I can never play safe from it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa allinta pukllayta atiymanchu

So he looked at her.	Chaymi payqa qhawarisqa.
I wasn’t sure if it was right or wrong	Manam segurochu karqani allinchu icha mana allin kasqanmantaqa
Maybe it would have been.	Ichapas chayna kanman karqa.

The process was not that difficult.	Chay ruwayqa manan chhayna sasachu karqan.

I didn’t know it existed	Manam yacharqanichu chay kasqanmantaqa
I couldn't see why.	Manam rikurqanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
So they are very important.	Chaymi paykunaqa ancha importante kanku.
It seemed kind of familiar.	Chayqa rikchakurqa huk laya riqsisqa hina.
Tell me what’s wrong.	Willaway ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
He seemed to be like that.	Payqa chayman rikchakurqa.

But the truth is here.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi kaypi kashan.
But this is best not for long.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi mana unaytachu.

He probably had no idea what was going to happen.	Payqa manachá imachus pasananta yuyaykurqanchu.
But I couldn’t stop him	Ichaqa manan hark’ayta atirqanichu
But he was sad and sad.	Ichaqa llakisqa llakisqa kasharqan.
I felt so safe and secure	Ancha seguro hinaspa segurom tarikurqani

Great performance tonight	Kunan tuta hatun ruway
I did that the night before	Chaytaqa ñawpaq tutan ruwarqani

Who knows what will come next.	Pitaq yachan imakuna chaymanta hamunanta.
I know and hear things	Imakunatapas yachani, uyarini ima
I’m a scientist.	Yachaysapa kani.

That would be another thing though.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi kanman ichaqa.
He’s obviously.	Payqa sut’inmi.
This will continue to happen.	Kayqa hinallam kanqa.
He stayed there for two weeks.	Chaypin iskay semana qhepakurqan.
He wasn’t up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu karqan.

This is a beautiful thing.	Kayqa sumaq kaqmi.
I don't know how many days it took.	Mana yachanichu hayka punchawmi pasarqa.

Now I wasn’t so sure about that	Kunanqa manan chaymantaqa anchatachu seguro karqani

But that doesn’t make it any better.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa aswan allinchu.
I can’t really say for sure here	Manam chiqaptaqa kaypiqa chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu
I know nothing about what is right	Manam imatapas yachanichu imapas allin kasqanmantaqa

So I’m going to.	Chaymi chayman.

And then the year.	Hinaspa chaymanta wata.

It felt like the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruway hinam tarikurqa.
You’ll learn quickly.	Usqhayllan yachanki.
I know you are smart.	Yachanim yachaysapa kasqaykita.
He wanted to do more and see more and be more.	Payqa munarqa aswan ruwayta hinaspa aswan qawayta hinaspa aswan achka kayta.
I'm not sure which, actually.	Manam segurochu kani mayqin, chiqaptaqa.

That’s not true, but it doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu, ichaqa manan imananpaschu.

I wanted to talk about it	Chayta rimayta munarqani
I wasn’t there at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaypichu karqani
I couldn't stand it	Chaytaqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu
I knew you were out there	Yacharqanim chay hawapi kasqaykita
I feel better now.	Kunanqa aswan allintam tarikuni.
I can’t help but think that’s amazing	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu, chayqa admirakuypaqmi kasqanmanta
I had plenty of time yesterday	Qayna punchawmi achka tiempoy karqa
I never wanted to know	Manam haykapipas yachayta munarqanichu
A great house to be comfortable with	Huk hatun wasi allin kananpaq
But they were quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan karqanku.
I don’t need to be here	Manam kaypi kayta necesitasaqchu
I thought this is it	Kaymi nispaymi piensarqani
I just wish he wouldn’t	Munaymanmi ichaqa mana chayta ruwananta
I'm not quite sure how.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam.
A very big man, but a man	Ancha hatun runa, ichaqa runa
You're not me.	Manam ñuqachu kanki'.
I won’t be able to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta atisaqchu.
I knew we had failed	Yacharqanim mana allin ruwasqaykumanta

A few weeks later	Iskay kinsa semana qhepaman

You never know when it will happen.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu haykapi chayna kananta.
I never knew if it was day or night	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu punchaw utaq tuta kasqanmantaqa
I know he can sing	Yachanim takiyta atisqanmanta
This is who we are.	Kaymi pikuna kanchik.
I can't do anything	Manam imatapas ruwaymanchu
I wanted to be like him	Ñoqapas pay hina kaytan munarqani
He went somewhere.	Maymanpas rirqa.
The most recent one.	Aswan qhipa kaq.
This is going to be tough.	Kayqa sinchi sasa kanqa.
I can’t help it	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu
No one is sure why.	Manam pipas segurochu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I knew all of this well	Tukuy chaykunataqa allintam yacharqani
She could tell he was half-scared.	Payqa repararqanmi kuskan mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to, ever.	Manam munarqanichu, haykapipas.
It looked a lot like it.	Anchatam rikchakurqa.
And it's actually worse.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi.
It’s a big deal for you.	Hatun ruwaymi qampaq.
There had been no one for so long	Chayna unayñam mana pipas karqachu
It couldn’t be better.	Manam aswan allinchu kanman.
He knows how to play	Payqa pukllayta yachan
But if you’re like me you really want to leave.	Ichaqa ñoqa hina kanki chayqa anchatan munanki ripuyta.
But it’s a big one.	Ichaqa hatunmi.
I'm not sure.	manam segurochu kani.
I mean, there was nothing	Niyta munani, mana imapas karqachu
I didn’t want to leave	Manam ripuyta munarqanichu
It’s easier this way.	Kay hinaqa aswan facilmi.
He wouldn’t want to leave.	Payqa manan ripuyta munanmanchu.
He was a difficult guy.	Payqa sasam karqa.
I was never going to be happy	Manam haykapipas kusisqachu kanay karqa
It was like that somewhere.	Maypipas chayna karqa.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allin kaqmi karqa.
I wanted to go outside	Hawaman lluqsiyta munarqani
So that’s it.	Chaymi chaymi.
I know you are not happy	Yachanim mana kusisqachu kasqaykita
I heard he did it sometimes	Uyarirqanim wakin kutipi chayta ruwasqanmanta
I couldn’t hear anything	Manam imata uyariyta atirqanichu
He wanted to talk to me.	Payqa ñuqawan rimayta munarqa.
But I won’t do those things.	Ichaqa manan chaykunataqa ruwasaqchu.
I didn’t know it would be good	Manam yacharqanichu allin kananta
It shouldn’t be a big deal.	Mana hatun ruwaychu kanan.
If you know you’re not, you are.	Sichus yachanki mana kasqaykita chayqa, kanki.
I’ll do that later	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi ruwasaq
But we agree very well.	Ichaqa ancha allintam acuerdopi kayku.
But I can’t find it	Ichaqa manan tarinichu
But in most cases, action is important.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim ruwayqa ancha allin.
I really think that is important	Chiqaptam chaytaqa ancha allin kasqanmanta piensani
I don’t know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I wanted to be arrested	Ñuqaqa hapisqa kaytam munarqani
I know you can't understand this	Yachanim kayta mana entiendeyta atisqaykita
It was a great couple of days.	Hatun iskay p'unchawmi karqan.
That was about it.	Chayqa chaymantam karqa.
I knew he wasn't ready	Yacharqanim mana listo kasqanmanta
Beautiful guy.	Sumaq runa.
I wanted to know if there was anyone else here	Kaypi huk runa kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
I'm not sure that's the right thing to do.	Manam segurochu kani chay ruwayqa allinchu kasqanmantaqa.
He wants to eat again.	Payqa yapamanta mikhuyta munan.
I want to know who they are	Pikuna kasqankuta yachayta munani
You don’t want him to succeed.	Manan munankichu allinta ruwananta.
I don’t believe in anything like that.	Manam chayna imapipas creenichu.
I did really well, actually	Chiqaptam allinta ruwarqani, chiqaptaqa
I mean, he’s pretty cool	Niyta munani, payqa ancha sumaqmi
It was human, sort of.	Runa hinam karqa, huk laya.
There was nobody anyone.	Manam pipas pipas karqachu.
It wasn’t there anymore.	Manañam karqachu.
That was tough, really tough.	Chayqa sinchi sinchi karqan, cheqaq sinchi.
I feel like I’m there	Chaypi hinam tarikuni
I just couldn’t stand to be there anymore	Chaylla manaña aguantayta atirqanichu chaypi kanaypaq
I couldn't do anything about them	Chaykunataqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
It’s more like one.	Aswan huk hinam.
I really wanted him to be a bad guy	Anchatam munarqani mana allin runa kananta
It’s not a practice.	Mana ruwaymi.
He was the guy who did it.	Payqa chayta ruwaq wayna kasqa.
Something to get the job done.	Imapas chay llamkayta ruwananpaq.
I didn’t really mean anything by that	Manam chiqaptachu chaywanqa imatapas niyta munarqani
They were regular people.	Paykunaqa sapa kutilla runakunam karqaku.
I couldn’t tell him anything	Manam imatapas willayta atirqanichu
But it’s not too bad.	Ichaqa manan ancha mana allinchu.
I said it was okay	Allinmi nispaymi nirqani
I felt nervous for no reason	Mana imaraykupas mancharisqa tarikurqani
Everyone else was terrified.	Llapan wakin runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
This, however, is the most important.	Kaymi ichaqa aswan allinqa.
I know that's him.	Yachanim chay pay kasqanmanta.
I know everything will work out for you	Yachanim tukuy imapas qampaq allin kananta
I heard it but didn't see it, or perhaps I did.	Uyarirqanim ichaqa manam rikurqanichu, utaq yaqapaschá.
I feel like you’re going to do great things with it	Chaywanmi hatun ruwaykunata ruwanki nispaymi sientekuni
I know what happened.	Yachanim imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
A really nice little one	Chiqap sumaq pisi
I didn’t want you to do that before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan munarqanichu chayta ruwanaykita
Two years.	Iskay wata.
It was really tough	Chiqaptam sinchi karqa
But he couldn’t tell.	Ichaqa manan yachayta atirqanchu.
I could never understand them	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa entiendeyta atirqanichu
This is a really big one.	Kayqa chiqap hatunmi.
I think he did a great job	Yuyaykuni huk hatun sumaq llamkayta ruwasqanmanta
Do that thinking.	Chay yuyaymanayta ruway.
Make a few bucks.	Iskay kimsa qullqita ruway.
I had to get drunk	Machasqa kanay karqan
But, if you really want this.	Ichaqa, sichus cheqaqtapuni kayta munanki chayqa.
He couldn't say why.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
I can’t do what he says	Nisqanman hinaqa manam ruwaymanchu
I feel so much better now	Kunanqa ancha allintam sientekuni
I still can't think of anything	Kunankamapas manam imatapas yuyaymanayta atinichu
I'm not going to do it now.	Manam kunanqa ruwasaqchu’, nispa.
But there’s something there, after all.	Ichaqa chaypiqa kanmi imapas, tukuy imamanta.
But I didn’t do that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
I couldn’t win at all	Manam imapipas atipayta atirqanichu
I wonder if he knows about it.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus chaymanta yachanchu.
This, however, fails.	Kaymi ichaqa mana allintachu ruwan.
I was with you last night	Qayna tutan qanwan karqani
I can’t, or anyway not yet.	Manam atiymanchu, utaq imayna kaptinpas manaraqmi.
He never had to do it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanan karqanchu.
I didn’t really know what it was	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
This approach is probably the best.	Kay ruwayqa yaqapaschá aswan allinqa.
I know you're tired.	Yachanim sayk'usqa kasqaykita.
I couldn’t help but agree with him	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu paywan acuerdopi kayta
If anyone knows.	Pipas yachan chayqa.
I immediately said yes	Chayllam arí nirqani
I want to help him out	Payta yanapayta munani
This is now a second chance.	Kaymi kunanqa iskay kaq chansa.
More than that and more.	Aswan chaymanta aswan.
I knew this was one	Yacharqanim kay huknin kasqanmanta
I couldn’t finish it	Manam tukuyta atirqanichu
I was there last evening	Qayna chisi chaypi karqani
I didn’t do anything	Manam imatapas ruwarqanichu
This needs to be done better.	Chaytaqa aswan allintam ruwana.
You are still doing it today.	Kunankamapas chaytam ruwachkanki.
A lot of nice people got hurt for no reason.	Achka sumaq runakunam mana imaraykupas k’irisqa karqaku.
But it’s never good enough.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
It’s not a good thing.	Manan allinchu.
I doubt he ever will	Iskayrayani haykapipas ruwananmanta
I couldn’t see him anymore	Manañam rikuyta atirqanichu
Many people want that information	Achka runakunam chay willakuyta munanku
I wonder what he wants	Tapukuni imatataq munan
They are all human beings.	Llapan runakunam kanku.
I’m one of them.	Hukninmi kani.
I would just have to do it	Chayllaraqmi ruwanay kanman
So, he said.	Chaymi, nispa.
If it isn’t.	Mana kaptinqa.
I like to disagree.	Mana acuerdopi kaymi gustan.
I just didn’t know what he wanted	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu ima munasqanmanta
That was about a month ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
That’s what I meant	Chaynatam niyta munarqani
It’s really crazy.	Chiqaptam loco.
I know he really wants to see it again	Yachanim chiqaptapuni hukmanta qawayta munasqanmanta
I can't say that	Chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu
I had no idea what I was going to be like	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu karqani imayna kanaypaq
We had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayku karqan.
I feel really good about you.	Chiqamanta allinta qammanta sientekuni.
But I couldn’t do it	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu
I hope that’s the case.	Chaynatam suyachkani.
This is not a valid statement.	Kay nisqanqa mana allinchu.
I listened to him very carefully	Paytaqa ancha allintam uyarirqani
I could never know	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu
I don't like it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam gustanchu.
I will have to act immediately	Chayllam imatapas ruwanay kanqa
But he never said anything about it.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas nirqanchu.
I think it looks beautiful	Sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensani
I was sure he knew	Seguro karqani yachasqanmanta
Good child.	Allin wawa.
So this will be quick.	Chaymi kayqa utqaylla kanqa.
Easy.	Mana sasa.
I don’t think this is a good morning	Manam kayqa allin paqarin kananpaqchu yuyani
I didn’t have to act on it	Manam chayman hinachu ruwanay karqa
I have never seen anything like this in the world	Manam haykapipas kay pachapi hinaqa rikurqanichu
There, that was better.	Chaypim, chayqa aswan allin karqa.
Never at the end of this year though.	Mana hayk’aqpas kay wata tukukuypi ichaqa.
She is beautiful though.	Payqa sumaqmi ichaqa.
I’m better than that	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kani
I wasn’t ready to talk to him	Manam listochu karqani paywan rimanaypaq
I can’t play the game.	Manam pukllayta atiymanchu.
Not so much today.	Mana ancha kunan punchawchu.
So it was quite a mistake.	Chaymi allinta pantasqa.
So much learning there.	Chayna achka yachay chaypi.
Here, not so much.	Kaypi, mana anchatachu.
I don’t know if you do.	Manam yachanichu chayta ruwanki icha manachu chaytaqa.
But that won’t work.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa allinchu kanqa.
The righteous man thinks first	Allin ruwaq runaqa ñawpaqtaqa allintan yuyaykun
I had to make sure it wasn't	Mana kasqanmanta seguro kanay karqa
But, I think you’re thinking a lot	Ichaqa, anchata yuyaykusqaykita yuyaykuni
I didn't know it was included here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi churasqa kasqanmanta
I thought nothing of it	Manam imapipas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
And, he wanted to be there.	Hinaspa, chaypi kayta munarqa.
But today was a good day.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi allin punchaw karqa.
Yes, he knew that, he says.	Arí, chaytam yacharqa, nispas nin.
I'll do it tonight.	Kunan tutam ruwasaq.
That's my biggest thing.	Chayqa ñuqapa aswan hatun kaqmi.
Better than you, a lot.	Aswan allin qammanta, achka.
I doubt anyone will be there	Iskayrayani pipas chaypi kananta
I think that’s the problem now	Chayqa kunan sasachakuy kasqanmanta yuyani
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatunmi karqan.
That is probably a very difficult thing to do.	Chayqa yaqapaschá sinchi sasa ruway.
I just didn’t want to be happy anymore.	Chaylla manaña kusisqa kayta munarqanichu.
I wonder what’s wrong with him	Tapukuni imataq paywan kachkan
I can’t talk tonight	Kunan tutaqa manaña rimayta atinichu
Why is a mystery.	Imaraykutaq huk pakasqa yachay.
It was kind of nice.	Huk laya sumaqmi karqan.
I can’t believe it either	Ñoqapas manan creeyta atiymanchu
This is a very difficult one.	Kayqa sinchi sasam.
Easy is good enough.	Facil nisqa allinmi.
It was an amazing night.	Chay tutaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Obviously this is more recent.	Sut’inmi kayqa aswan qhipa pacha.
I’ll need them later	Chaykunataqa qhepamanmi necesitasaq
I know what these things are like	Yachanim kaykunaqa imayna kasqanmanta
I want to be okay with that	Chaywanqa allinmi kayta munani
I didn’t know he was coming back	Manam yacharqanichu kutimunanta
Being a human being.	Runa kay.
That was not good at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu karqan.
I want to hear more, more, more.	Aswan, aswan, aswan uyariyta munani.
Nothing could be simpler.	Manan imapas aswan facilchu kanman.
I know they are happy	Yachanim kusisqa kasqankuta
If you think about it.	Yuyanki chayqa.
I know this is true	Yachanim kay chiqap kasqanmanta
And herein lies the problem.	Hinaspa kaypi kachkan chay sasachakuy.
I want you to be better than me	Ñoqaqa munani ñoqamanta aswan allin kanaykita
Last night was better.	Qayna tutaqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I am so excited to give it a go	Ancha kusisqam kachkani huk kutita ruwanaypaq
I mean, for me.	Niyta munani, ñuqapaq.
I couldn't see this	Kaytaqa manam rikuyta atirqanichu
I don’t think you should.	Manam yuyanichu chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I knew nothing about this	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu
Not this guy.	Mana kay runachu.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Manam yachanichu chayna kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmantaqa.
But they’re caught.	Ichaqa hap’isqa kanku.
I immediately felt so frustrated	Chayllam chayna hukmanyasqa tarikurqani
I feel so sorry for him.	Paytaqa anchatam llakikuni.
I didn’t want to hear it all night	Manam tukuy tuta uyariyta munarqanichu
I didn’t want anyone to know.	Manam pipas yachananta munarqanichu.
I know he shouldn't though	Yachanim ichaqa mana ruwanan kasqanmanta
I have to be the one there	Chaypi kaqmi kanay
He’s got to do this job.	Payqa kay llamk’ayta ruwanan tiyan.
I knew one would do more time	Yacharqanim huknin aswan tiempota ruwananta
Actually, it’s a process.	Chiqaptaqa, huk ruwaymi.
I'm like a fool.	Sonso hinam kachkani.
I haven’t heard of this.	Kaytaqa manam uyarirqanichu.
I can’t help it anymore.	Manañam yanapayta atiymanchu.
It really shouldn't be that hard.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna sasachu kanan.
I knew he needed that from me	Yacharqanim chayta ñuqamanta necesitasqanmanta
So, a few.	Chaymi, huk iskay kimsa.
I knew it was going to be a difficult day	Yacharqanim sasachakuy punchaw kasqanmanta
I don’t know what he wants to do.	Manam yachanichu ima ruwayta munasqanmanta.
I was a little tired too	Ñoqapas huk chhikantan sayk’usqa karqani
I wish he was here with us	Munaymanmi kaypi ñuqaykuwan kananta
I never heard from him again after that	Chay qhepamanmi manaña hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu
It was that simple.	Chayna facilmi karqa.
I can’t hear this stuff	Manam kay imakunatapas uyariyta atinichu
I know you won't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I have no idea what’s wrong.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
Perhaps there is too much of it.	Ichapas chaypiqa ancha achka kachkan.
That’s what he says all the time now.	Chaytan kunanqa sapa kutilla nin.
The last three.	Qhipa kimsa.
I just don’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
But now.	Ichaqa kunan.
And he knew something else.	Hinaspa hukta yacharqa.
No, seriously though.	Manan, serio ichaqa.
Every day, every night, every hour.	Sapa punchaw, sapa tuta, sapa hora.
I would certainly do it.	Chiqamanta ruwayman.
No one ever knows.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yachanchu.
I know a lot of it is true	Yachanim achka chiqap kasqanmanta
It’s not good enough now.	Kunanqa manan allinchu.
I couldn’t find one	Manam hukta tariyta atirqanichu
And he was the one.	Hinaspa payqa karqan.
I couldn’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikuyta atirqanichu
I can’t do that anymore	Manañam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
I know you are a good person	Yachanim allin runa kasqaykita
That’s kind of an easy thing to do.	Chayqa huk laya facil ruwaymi.
I take it as he wants it	Munasqanman hinam hapini
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutim karqa.
I knew anyway	Imayna kaptinpas yacharqanim
Yes, he did that.	Arí, payqa chaytan ruwarqan.
That’s what he knew.	Chaytaqa payqa yacharqanmi.
I want to know their secrets	Pakasqa kasqankuta yachayta munani
It couldn’t be worse.	Manan aswan mana allinchu kanman.
I wanted to ask him something.	Payta imatapas tapuyta munarqani.
I am really looking forward to playing with him.	Chiqaptam suyachkani paywan pukllayta.
I know he did the job, but never again.	Yachanim chay llamkayta ruwasqanmanta, ichaqa manañam haykapipas.
But he was a happy man.	Ichaqa kusisqa runan karqan.
I still think about this every day.	Kunankamapas sapa punchawmi kaypi piensani.
I had no intention of doing this	Manam kayta ruwanaypaqqa yuyaykurqanichu
He said it as often as he could.	Payqa atisqanman hinan sapa kutilla chayta nisqa.
It’s better for me to help.	Aswan allinmi ñuqapaq yanapanaypaq.
I want to tell you a story.	Huk willakuyta willayta munani.
I didn’t know how to help.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna yanapayta.
The largest in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan hatun.
You are pretty sure.	Qamqa allin segurom kanki.
I haven't been here in many years	Achka watañam mana kaypichu kachkani
I couldn’t sleep either	Ñuqapas manam puñuyta atirqanichu
I heard him say good many times	Uyarirqanim achka kutita allin nispa nisqanmanta
Something was terribly wrong, but he didn’t know what it was.	Imapas sinchi mana allinchu kasqa, ichaqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
And then the next one.	Hinaspa chaymanta qatiqnin.
I didn’t know what to do here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi imata ruwanayta
He sounds disappointed.	Payqa hukmanyasqa hinam uyarikun.
Not so much this time.	Mana anchatachu kay kutipi.
I hope he doesn’t come back	Suyachkani manaña kutimunanta
Smarter than I am.	Ñoqamanta aswan yachaysapa.
I didn’t want to do anything, really	Manam imatapas ruwayta munarqanichu, chiqaptaqa
About a month.	Huk killa hina.
I wanted to know everything	Tukuy imatam yachayta munarqani
As a result, he was constantly in trouble	Chayraykum sapa kuti sasachakuypi tarikurqa
Then I know exactly where they are	Chaymantaqa allintam yachani maypi kasqankuta
He was in trouble.	Sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I know it will happen	Yachanim chayna pasananta
He is a very strong man.	Payqa sinchi sinchi runam.
Once upon a time.	Huk kutipi.
He left the message, no reply.	Willayta saqirqa, mana kutichiyta.
I just couldn’t take it all in	Chaylla mana tukuyta hap’iyta atirqanichu
This is still not good enough.	Kayqa kunankamapas mana allinchu.
I have no idea what day it is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima punchaw kasqanmantaqa
I really wanted to do the same	Ñoqapas anchatan munarqani chayta ruwayta
But it’s not the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu.
Then another.	Chaymanta huk.
But it was a bad time.	Ichaqa mana allin tiempon karqan.
I wonder what’s in it	Tapukuni imakuna chaypi kasqanmanta
Don't know if you knew that.	Mana yachankichu chayta yacharqankichu icha manachu.
It’s much bigger than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi.
Nothing more than that.	Mana imapas aswan chaymantaqa.
Now, or never.	Kunanqa, utaq haykapipas.
You’ve just been busy.	Chayraqmi ocupasqa kashanki.
People want more than that, you know.	Runakunaqa chaymanta aswan achkatam munanku, yachanki.
Sure he did that.	Seguro chayta ruwarqan.
I wonder what happened	Tapukuni imataq chay pasasqanmanta
Tired of being tired.	Sayk’usqa kaymanta sayk’usqa.
He probably couldn't hear it.	Manapaschá chaytaqa uyariyta atirqanchu.
Can you help with this? 	¿Atiwaqchu kaypi yanapayta?
They know so much about you.	Paykunaqa anchatan qanmanta yachanku.
His name is on it.	Sutinmi chaypi kachkan.
I want to be with him	Paywan kaytam munani
I know exactly what he said.	Yachanim chiqaptapuni ima nisqanmanta.
A very handsome man opened the door	Huk ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq runam punkuta kicharirqa
I’d rather not.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana.
I do it like twice a week	Semanapi iskay kuti hinam ruwani
It’s not that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu.
He was injured for a while	Payqa huk chikan pacha k'irisqa karqan
I just know that.	Chaylla yachani.
That was a great night.	Chayqa ancha hatun tutam karqa.
I knew they were great.	Yacharqanim hatun kasqankuta.
I want to be somebody instead of nobody	Mana pipas kaymantaqa pipas kaytam munani
He was so proud of me.	Payqa anchatan orgulloso karqan ñoqamanta.
He says we are fine.	Payqa allinmi kayku nin.
I thought that was the right thing to do	Chay ruwayqa allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
So please tell me.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa willaway.
And again we’re proud.	Hinaspa yapamanta orgulloso kayku.
I still didn't know who he was	Hinallam mana yacharqanichu pi kasqanmanta
I know better though	Aswan allinta yachani ichaqa
Last night was last night.	Qayna tutaqa qayna tutam karqa.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allintam rikchakurqa.
I just saw this one.	Chayraqmi kayta rikurqani.
And then he wanted to do the right thing.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa allinta ruwayta munarqa.
In anything else.	Imapipas.
I don’t want to know anymore.	Manañam yachayta munanichu.
I know you don't want to do that	Yachanim mana chayta ruwayta munasqaykita
They weren’t good enough.	Paykunaqa manan allinchu karqanku.
I really want to do the right thing	Anchatan munani allin kaqta ruwayta
He had a lot of ideas.	Achka yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Everything made so much sense.	Tukuy imapas ancha yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
A girl like you is vulnerable	Qan hina sipasmi mana allin qhawarisqa
I am truly concerned about it	Cheqaqtapunin chaymanta llakikuni
I thought twice about it	Chaypin iskay kutita yuyaykurqani
But we didn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwarqayku.
But I don't know what to do.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imatachus ruwanayta.
He said that every day.	Chaynatam sapa punchaw nirqa.
So, very angry.	Chaymi, ancha phiñasqa.
He couldn't have made anyone better.	Manam pitapas aswan allinta ruwayta atinmanchu karqa.
I couldn’t stop coming	Manam hamuyta saqiyta atirqanichu
I could never figure that out.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I never knew his real name	Manam haykapipas chiqap sutinta yacharqanichu
It’s really interesting.	Chiqaptam ancha sumaq.
I had no reason to want him	Manam imaraykupas paytaqa munarqanichu
I will be a stranger	Mana riqsisqa runam kasaq
I didn’t know how to say it	Manam yacharqanichu imayna niyta
I heard from him this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi paymanta uyarirqani.
Now we are.	Kunanqa kanchik.
Bad, bad, bad.	Mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
Or this action.	Utaq kay ruway.
I can’t watch it now	Manam kunanqa qawayta atiymanchu
Not bad, this time.	Mana mana allinchu, kay kutipi.
He’s not like that though.	Payqa manan chay hinachu ichaqa.
I really hope you never are	Chiqaptam suyachkani mana haykapipas chayna kasqaykita
But, you never know.	Ichaqa, manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
I am here to tell you	Ñoqaqa kaypim kachkani willanaypaq
I wanted to say something above.	Imatapas hawapi niyta munarqani.
I can't bear to wait for him anymore	Manañam aguantayta atinichu payta suyayta
Now I may have to.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay kanqa.
I know there is more to it than that	Yachanim chaymanta aswan achka kasqanmanta
And every morning.	Hinaspa sapa paqarin.
I would never have agreed	Manam haykapipas acuerdopichu kayman karqa
I want to think about that	Chaypim yuyaymanayta munani
I thought that was pretty safe	Chayqa allin seguro kananpaqmi piensarqani
I wonder what he did there	Chaypi imatataq ruwasqanmanta tapukuni
I’ve never been this happy either.	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas kay hina kusisqachu karqani.
A good man who does nothing wrong	Mana ima mana allin ruwaq allin runa
I am quite afraid of him.	Paytaqa allintam manchakuni.
So, that’s it.	Chaymi, chaymi.
Beautiful out there.	Sumaq chay hawapi.
You can’t do it.	Qamqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You can’t talk anymore.	Manañam rimayta atiwaqchu.
I felt like a human being	Runa hinam tarikurqani
Yeah, this is something.	Arí, kayqa imapas.
I said that might not be a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá mana allinchu kanman nispaymi nirqani.
I thought that was great	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
Yes, this is a process.	Arí, kayqa huk ruwaymi.
I know he thought he was doing the right thing.	Yachanim allinta ruwasqanpi piensasqanmanta.
You know, food.	Yachanki, mikhuy.
I can’t not do it	Manam mana ruwayta atiymanchu
Now I was sure of it	Kunanqa segurom karqani chaymanta
I really want to be like him in every way	Anchatam munani tukuy imapipas pay hina kayta
I didn’t mean this conversation	Manam kay rimayta munarqanichu
He said he didn’t.	Payqa manan nispas nisqa.
But what about everything else? 	Ichaqa, ¿tukuy imapas?
That sounds so simple, but it works.	Chayqa ancha facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa allinmi.
Both are very.	Iskayninku ancha.
First, I wanted to speed that up.	Ñawpaqtaqa chayta usqhaylla ruwayta munarqani.
This was the day.	Kay punchawmi karqa.
If there is such a thing.	Chayna imapas kaptinqa.
That is never certain.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas segurochu.
I am very happy today	Kunan punchawmi ancha kusisqa tarikuni
I can’t watch it, actually	Manam qawayta atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa
I felt lonely, scared, and depressed	Sapallanmi tarikurqani, mancharisqa hinaspa llumpay llakisqa tarikurqani
Me, it’s not that good.	Ñuqa, mana chayna allinchu.
I have to do the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwanay
Tonight is one of them	Kunan tuta kayqa hukninmi
I couldn’t hear it	Manam uyariyta atirqanichu
I have done this before	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytam ruwarqani
This was another wet day.	Kayqa huk chiri punchawmi karqa.
You just keep going now.	Qamqa kunanqa hinallam riy.
No one had ever done that before.	Chaytaqa manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
There is no one better than this.	Manan pipas kaymantaqa aswan allinqa kanchu.
I don't know how this will come about.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam kay hamunanta.
He was kind of surprised.	Payqa huk laya admirasqa kasqa.
He doesn’t know what’s in it.	Payqa manan yachanchu imakuna chaypi kashasqanmanta.
It doesn't get any easier than this.	Kaymantaqa manam aswan facilchu.
So he’s going to be there for a while.	Chaymi payqa huk tiempo chaypi kanqa.
And he caught it.	Hinaspa hap’irqan.
It sounds sad.	Llakikuypaqmi uyarikun.
And, we did it.	Hinaspa, ruwarqayku.
I mean, that would certainly make sense.	Niyta munani, chayqa chiqamanta yuyayniyuq kanman.
They’re so stupid.	Paykunaqa ancha sonso kanku.
I really feel bad for him	Cheqaqtapunin paymanta mana allintachu sientekuni
The way he did it.	Imayna ruwasqanmanta.
So it shouldn’t be easy though.	Chaymi ichaqa mana facilchu kanan.
I would always be there.	Sapa kutim chaypi kayman.
Who knows how long that will last.	¿Pitaq yachan hayka tiempo chayna kananta.
He knew it was the latter.	Payqa yacharqanmi qhepa kaq kasqanmanta.
I know he would agree	Yachanim payqa acuerdopi kananta
You can't talk about this.	Kaymantaqa manam rimayta atiwaqchu.
It’s pretty big, actually	Ancha hatunmi, chiqaptaqa
It would certainly be easier to do.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan facil ruway kanman.
I didn’t know what to do about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq
Tell me where you are.	Maypi kasqaykita willaway.
I mean, you look beautiful	Niyta munani, sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqaykita
I just didn’t know what to do	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I'm doing a lot more of that now.	Kunanqa aswan achkatam chaymanta ruwachkani.
He considered it for a while.	Huk tiempon chayta qhawarirqan.
But he is not the same person.	Ichaqa manan kaq runachu.
I couldn’t stay any longer	Manañan qhepakuyta atirqanichu
I must have the worst luck in the world	Kay pachapi aswan mana allin suerteyoqmi kanay
I never thought of a gift for her	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu paypaq huk regalota
I can tell you about everything	Tukuy imamanta willayta atiyman
That maybe this means a lot to someone.	Chayqa ichapas kayqa pimanpas anchata niyta munan.
I was so cold, so scared	Ancha chiri, ancha mancharisqa karqani
A celebrity, there	Huk riqsisqa runa, chaypi
I never acted like that guy	Manam haykapipas chay runa hinaqa ruwarqanichu
I just didn’t really know what he was doing	Chaylla mana allintachu yacharqani ima ruwasqanmanta
please, please.	ama hina kaspa.
He might, he says.	Payqa ichapas, nispas nin.
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
But I know who he is	Ichaqa pi kasqanmantam yachani
I couldn't look at it that way	Manam chaynataqa qawayta atirqanichu
I am late, very late	Tarde kani, ancha tarde
That would be a little surprising.	Chayqa huk chikan admirakuypaqmi kanman.
I can’t think of anything	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atinichu
If you think you can, you will.	Sichus atisqaykita yuyaykunki chayqa, chaytan ruwanki.
Like, really, really great.	Imayna, chiqap, chiqap hatun.
I was sure it was.	Seguro karqani chayna kasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen immediately.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chayllachu pasarqa.
I’m pretty tired.	Allin sayk’usqañan kashani.
Just tell me you’re ready.	Chaylla willaway listoña kasqaykita.
I wouldn’t do it, otherwise	Manam ruwaymanchu, mana chayqa
Now would be the time to do so.	Kunanmi kanman chayta ruwanapaq tiempo.
I decided to do the same	Ñoqapas chayta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykurqani
There were ten.	Chunka karqan.
There were not as many people as there are today.	Kunan tiempopi hina achka runakunaqa manam karqachu.
I wonder if he ever will	Tapukunitaqmi haykapipas ruwanqachu icha manachu chayta
I should have done better	Aswan allintam ruwanay karqa
But it was daytime.	Ichaqa punchawmi karqa.
So, maybe not so good.	Chaymi, ichapas mana chayna allinchu.
I have always done the job	Sapa kutim chay llamkayta ruwarqani
First, he’s right.	Ñawpaqtaqa, payqa allintam nin.
Maybe it was a human being.	Ichapas runaqa karqa.
I wanted to talk to him, but he’s not ready.	Paywan rimayta munarqani, ichaqa manan listochu kashan.
And then he looked up.	Hinaspa chaymanta qhawarisqa.
I need to do more.	Astawan ruwanaypaqmi necesitasaq.
I wanted to do the right thing with it	Chaywanmi allinta ruwayta munarqani
I haven't seen him in such a long time	Chayna unayñam mana paytaqa rikurqanichu
That’s what I want to believe.	Chaytan creeyta munani.
I was a little worried, to be honest	Huk chikan llakisqa karqani, chiqap niy
He was alone in the scene	Payqa sapallanmi karqa
So little action.	Chaymi pisi ruway.
I pretty much know what that is	Yaqapaschá yachani imachus chay kasqanmanta
This seems to be the case.	Kayqa kanman hinam.
I mean, you never know	Niyta munani, manam haykapipas yachankichu
He felt like he could do anything.	Payqa imatapas ruwayta atinman hinam tarikurqa.
I hope so, really	Suyachkani chayna kananpaq, chiqaptapuni
It was really easy actually	Chiqaptam facil karqa chiqaptaqa
You’re not ready.	Mana listochu kanki.
So there was no one.	Chaymi mana pipas karqachu.
In fact, they are pretty good.	Aswanpas allin allinmi kanku.
I was so proud of him that day	Chay punchawmi paymanta anchata orgulloso karqani
Do this for yourself.	Kaytaqa qampaq ruway.
I partied a lot.	Achkatam fiestata ruwarqani.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
He is the greatest.	Paymi aswan hatun kaq.
I just thought about it.	Chayllaraqmi yuyaykurqani.
I know that is not true	Yachanim chay mana chiqap kasqanmanta
I can’t do it yet	Manaraqmi ruwayta atinichu
I know it’s this day	Yachanim kay punchaw kasqanta
I know you don’t want to.	Yachanim mana munasqaykita.
What is it, now? 	¿Imataq kachkan, kunan?
I'm not sure which one, to be honest.	Manam segurochu kani mayqin kasqanmanta, chiqap rimanaypaq.
I didn’t have the best idea	Manam aswan allin yuyayniyuqchu karqani
He doesn’t do that now.	Manam kunanqa chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Not the first time, of course.	Mana ñawpaq kutichu, chiqamanta.
But it seems very important.	Ichaqa ancha importante hinan rikch’akun.
I think that will continue	Chayqa hinallam kanqa nispam piensani
Maybe he was too early.	Ichapas payqa ancha temprano karqa.
But there are two possibilities.	Ichaqa iskay ruwaymi kan.
No one ever refused to play with me.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas mana munarqanchu ñoqawan pukllayta.
A better world.	Aswan allin pacha.
It looks ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam rikchakun.
I really hope you can figure this out	Chiqaptam suyachkani kayta yuyaymanayta atisqaykita
I meant the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan niyta munarqani.
Now there is one thing.	Kunanqa huk kaqmi kachkan.
He knows you are here now.	Payqa yachanmi kunan kaypi kasqaykita.
I really think it is	Chiqaptam piensani chayna kasqanmanta
I suspect he desperately needs money	Sospechani qullqita anchata necesitasqanmanta
I was a little surprised	Huk chhikantan admirakurqani
Early on, at least.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi, aswanpas.
Now he has an idea.	Kunanqa huk yuyayniyuqmi.
I think it might work for you one day	Yuyaykuni huk punchaw qampaq allin kanman
I feel like tonight is the night	Kunan tuta tuta kasqanmantam sientekuni
This is going to be amazing.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi kanqa.
I haven’t done that yet	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
Even if it is sometimes bad.	Wakin kuti mana allin kaptinpas.
There is nothing better than that.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas aswan allinqa kanchu.
They were a few years older than me.	Paykunaqa ñoqamanta iskay kinsa wata kuraq karqanku.
I could never do it, that's all	Manam haykapipas ruwayta atirqanichu, chayllam
I don’t think I’m going anywhere right now	Kunanqa manan maymanpas rinaypaq yuyaykunichu
That will make the process much easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi kanqa chay ruwayqa.
I don’t see this happening.	Manam rikunichu kay pasananta.
I mean, that was wrong.	Niyta munani, chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
There was a man	Huk runan kasqa
It was three thirty.	Kimsa kimsa chunka kasqa.
This was going to be huge.	Kayqa hatunmi kachkarqa.
I always have someone with me.	Sapa kutim pitapas ñuqawan kachkan.
You didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqankichu imata ruwanaykita.
They all seemed very happy.	Llapallankum ancha kusisqa hina karqaku.
I had no idea where he was going that night	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani mayman chay tuta rinanpaq
He looked annoyed.	Payqa phiñasqa hinan qhawarisqa.
But there is a second step.	Ichaqa iskay kaq ruwaymi kan.
That’s not hard now, is it? 	Chayqa manan sasachu kunanqa, ¿riki?
I mean the car, this guy	Carrota niyta munani, kay runa
He’d worried about this before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayna kasqanmanta llakisqa.
Not sure that matters.	Mana segurochu chay importante kasqanmanta.
It really was that good.	Chiqaptam chayna allin karqa.
I really need to get some sleep	Anchatan necesitasaq huk chhikanta puñuyta
He didn't know what to expect.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima suyakusqanmanta.
I really can’t do it.	Chiqaptaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
I know exactly what you want	Allintam yachani ima munasqaykita
You could have done better!.	¡Aswan allinta ruwawaq karqan!.
I just went for a walk, that’s all	Chaylla puriq rirqani, chaylla
I just wasn’t happy	Chayllam mana kusisqachu karqani
I want him here tomorrow	Paqarin kaypi payta munani
I mean that says something	Chayqa imatapas ninmi nispaymi
I didn’t see how he was guilty of anything	Manam rikurqanichu imamantapas imayna huchayoq kasqanmantaqa
But it doesn’t have to be for you.	Ichaqa manan qanpaq hinachu kanan.
And that’s really the best part.	Hinaspa chaymi chiqaptapuni aswan allinqa.
It doesn’t do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwanchu.
I don’t know much yet	Achkatam manaraq yachani
I knew it wouldn't work though	Yacharqanim ichaqa mana allinchu kananta
He couldn't quit, he couldn't quit.	Payqa manam saqiyta atirqachu, manam saqiyta atirqachu.
Nothing will happen tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manañam imapas kanqachu.
This one does.	Kayqa ruwan.
He couldn't now anyway.	Manas kunanqa atirqachu imayna kaptinpas.
Do it today.	Kunan punchaw ruway.
This is almost likely	Kayqa yaqapaschá yaqapaschá
I had no idea you were that smart	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani chayna yachaysapa kasqaykita
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
You can’t get anywhere.	Manan maymanpas chayayta atiwaqchu.
I wanted to do this	Kayta ruwayta munarqani
Go, now.	Riy, kunan.
This one is rather interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi.
He wasn’t there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu karqa.
Don’t miss this opportunity.	Ama kay oportunidadta qunqaychu.
He didn't have to do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwananchu karqan.
And then you want that to happen really fast.	Hinaspa chaymanta munanki chay pasananta chiqaptapuni utqaylla.
I don’t want to answer anymore	Manañam kutichiyta munanichu
I’ve heard that for a long time	Unayñan chayta uyarirqani
But I didn’t think it was true	Ichaqa manan cheqaq kananpaqchu yuyaykurqani
And that’s not like me.	Hinaspa chayqa manan ñoqa hinachu.
It’s not like it used to be.	Manan ñawpaqpi hinachu.
I know that you know.	Yachanim yachasqaykita.
But then again.	Ichaqa chaymanta.
That wouldn’t be so easy.	Chayqa manan chhayna facilchu kanman.
Preferably the latter.	Aswan allinqa kay qhipa kaq.
I knew what was good	Yacharqanim ima allin kasqanmanta
I mean, they’re beautiful.	Niyta munani, sumaqmi kanku.
It can’t be any other way.	Manan huk hinachu kanman.
I thought you were older	Yuyarqanim kuraq kasqaykita
Someone does this.	Pipas kayta ruwan.
I couldn’t afford one	Manam hukta rantiyta atirqanichu
I want there to be something more than that	Munani chaymanta aswan imapas kananta
But it wasn’t fast enough.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu karqan.
I would love to work with you too	Ñuqapas anchatam munani qamwan llamkayta
Something almost there, almost ready, almost .	Imapas yaqa chaypi kaq, yaqa listo, yaqa .
I had to do this work	Kay llamk’ayta ruwanay karqa
I never want to see it	Manam haykapipas qawayta munanichu
Easier that way.	Aswan facil chay hina.
Thus.	Kayna.
I wanted to do it here	Kaypi ruwayta munarqani
After that it was kind of just that.	Chay qhepamanmi huk laya chaylla karqan.
How very much like him.	Imayna ancha pay hina.
That means action.	Chayqa ruway niyta munan.
There is no one like you.	Qan hinaqa manan kanchu.
It was just beautiful.	Chaylla sumaq karqa.
I desperately wanted to see him again	Sinchitan munarqani hukmanta payta rikuyta
There was nothing wrong with that.	Chayna kaptinqa manam allinchu karqa.
I had a better idea	Aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I know you know it's true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta yachasqaykita.
I heard from him a few hours ago, actually	Paymanta uyarirqani iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqta, chiqaptaqa
He knew what had caused this.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus kayta ruwasqanmanta.
He knows what it’s like to be with you and me.	Yachanmi imayna kasqanmanta qanwan ñoqawan kayqa.
More worried about you	Qammanta aswan llakisqa
I hadn’t thought of it that way before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaynataqa piensarqanichu
Not really there.	Mana chiqap chaypichu.
This isn’t going to work.	Kayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
It looks like.	Rikchakun.
I know mine is mine.	Yachanim ñuqapa kaqta.
I had a lot to do tomorrow	Paqarinmi achka ruwanay karqa
You are going to do the right thing.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqmi kanki.
I didn’t want to go out with him	Manam paywan lluqsiyta munarqanichu
There he began making the film.	Chaypim chay peliculata ruwayta qallaykurqa.
I am caught there.	Chaypim hapisqa kachkani.
I felt important and down to earth	Importante hinaspa kay pachapi hinam tarikurqani
Please, for me.	Ama hina kaspa, ñuqapaq.
Go three years ago.	Kimsa wata ñawpaqta riy.
There is probably no reason.	Manachá imaraykupas kanchu.
I heard they were good	Uyarirqanim allin kasqankuta
He was a terrible man.	Payqa manchay runam karqa.
I didn’t want to be here anymore	Manañam kaypi kayta munarqanichu
I haven't seen him in three years now	Kunanqa kimsa watañam mana payta rikunichu
A celebrity said something	Huk riqsisqa runam imatapas nirqa
No one wants to talk to me.	Manan pipas ñoqawan rimayta munanchu.
I can't think about it now	Kunanqa manañam yuyaymanayta atinichu
But there’s nothing I can do about it	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atiymanchu
I think that’s a great restaurant	Chayqa huk hatun mikhuy wasi kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
I wanted to be him.	Pay kaytam munarqani.
He didn’t realize it.	Payqa manan chayta repararqanchu.
I tried to do my best	Tukuy atisqayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
I wanted to make your favorite meal	Munasqayki mikhunata ruwayta munarqani
I didn’t mean that it wasn’t	Manam chaytaqa mana hinachu niyta munarqani
I can do it right, as I learned as a kid	Allinta ruwayta atiyman, imaynatachus wawa kaspa yacharqani
But perhaps the truth was the best course of action.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá cheqaq kaq aswan allin ruway karqan.
As black as possible.	Atisqanman hina yana.
I can’t say no to him	Manam paytaqa mana niyta atiymanchu
I wasn’t happy	Manam kusisqachu karqani
I knew he would never do that again	Yacharqanim manaña haykapipas chaynata ruwananta
It may be later.	Qhepamanmi kanman.
Never heard a word from him.	Mana hayk’aqpas huk simita paymanta uyarirqanichu.
This was not the case.	Kayqa manan hinachu karqan.
It sounds better.	Aswan allin uyarikun.
You can never buy it.	Manam haykapipas rantiyta atiwaqchu.
He knew it was coming.	Yacharqa hamunanta.
And this is the best.	Hinaspa kaymi aswan allinqa.
But they are still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkanku.
I thought you did	Yuyarqanim chaynata ruwasqaykita
I couldn’t let him do it again	Manam hukmanta ruwananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I don’t want it right and I don’t want it wrong.	Manam allintachu munani nitaq mana allintachu munani.
I can never do it right.	Manam haykapipas allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I didn’t expect it to be there	Manam suyarqanichu chaypi kananta
And all the time about it.	Hinaspa tukuy tiempo chaymanta.
One day he came to the house.	Huk punchawmi chay wasiman hamurqa.
I may not be able to do that	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
I knew that at least	Chaytaqa yacharqanim aswanpas
I want to be a private person	Ñuqaqa sapallay runa kayta munani
Make it happen today.	Kunan punchaw chayna kananpaq ruway.
Whatever is good for you.	Imapas qampaq allin kaq.
I always dislike it	Sapa kutim mana allinpaq hapini
I don’t have many people to talk to.	Manam achka runakuna rimanaypaq kanchu.
I saw him a few years ago	Paytaqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani
That would be better.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He probably does that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwan.
But he did it.	Ichaqa paymi chayta ruwarqan.
This was bigger than him.	Kayqa paymanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
Like, real quick.	Imayna, chiqap utqaylla.
I didn’t know who these people were.	Manam yacharqanichu pikuna kay runakuna kasqankuta.
There is no such thing here.	Kaypiqa manam kanchu.
I'm going for a walk tonight	Kunan tutam puriq risaq
will do it first.	ñawpaqtaqa ruwanqa.
But he said yes.	Ichaqa arí nisqa.
I’d rather walk away	Aswan allinmi kanman puriyta
He is a stranger.	Payqa mana riqsisqa runam.
I want to be angry about this.	Kaymanta phiñasqa kayta munani.
The bigger the better, it seems.	Aswan hatun ruwayqa aswan allinmi, rikchakun.
But he can do what he can.	Ichaqa atisqanman hinan ruwanman.
I don’t want to do anything	Manam ima ruwaytapas munanichu
Perform the following step.	Qatiqnin ruwayta ruway.
I would have to agree	Ñoqaqa acuerdopi kanay kanman
If he doesn’t agree with you, that’s fine.	Sichus payqa mana qanwan acuerdopichu kashan chayqa, allinmi.
And a great deal.	Hinaspa hatun ruway.
But he knew it was coming.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi hamunanta.
I can be the one to be.	Ñuqam kayta atiyman.
I mean, very well.	Niyta munani, ancha allinta.
There was nothing there.	Manam imapas chaypiqa karqachu.
I will never be good again.	Manañam haykapipas allinchu kasaq.
This is a lot of people.	Kayqa ancha achka runakunam.
I didn’t want to talk about it anymore	Manañam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
I can’t stop thinking about it	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta saqiyta atiymanchu
I mean, there was no point in doing that	Niyta munani, mana imapaqpas chay ruwayqa karqachu
People don’t care.	Runakunaqa manam imananpaschu.
I really do, you know	Chiqaptam ruwani, yachanki
They are proud of it.	Paykunaqa chaymantam orgulloso kanku.
Still, they were better than nothing.	Chayna kaptinpas, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi karqaku.
I was a little curious	Huk chhikantan yachayta munarqani
Maybe it will happen again.	Ichapas yapamanta chayna kanman.
I’ve long suspected why	Unayñan sospechani imarayku kasqanmanta
Hopefully, that wouldn’t be the case.	Munaymanmi, mana chayna kananta.
He knows that, now.	Chaytaqa yachanmi, kunanqa.
I couldn't stand it there	Chaypiqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu
He had always been with her.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi paywan kuska kachkarqa.
No, never that.	Manan, mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa.
You know you are.	Yachankim kasqaykita.
I am a college teacher.	Colegiopi yachachiqmi kani.
I mean, nobody knows that	Niyta munani, chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu
Maybe that’s what happened.	Ichapas chayna pasarqa.
That's like always.	Chayqa sapa kuti hinam.
I couldn't tell if he was happy or disappointed	Manam yachayta atirqanichu kusisqa icha hukmanyasqa kasqanmantaqa
Therefore he will do well.	Chayraykum allinta ruwanqa.
I don't really know if it will ever happen	Manam chiqaptachu yachani haykapipas chayna kananta
I wanted to make sure this was what you wanted	Kay munasqayki kananpaqmi seguro kayta munarqani
I saw it almost immediately	Chaytaqa yaqa chaylla hinam rikurqani
Things were not the same as before.	Imapas mana ñawpaq hinachu karqa.
I had no idea what was wrong	Manam piensarqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I'm not sure this is true.	Manam allintachu yachani kayqa chiqap kasqanmantaqa.
I cannot stand this	Kaytaqa manam aguantayta atiymanchu
I mean, well, maybe sort of	Niyta munani, allinmi, ichapas huk laya
We used to have a party.	Ñawpaqtaqa fiestata ruwaq kayku.
He has been here for the first year.	Kaypiqa ñawpaq watañam kachkan.
I would act like anyone else	Huk runa hinam ruwayman
I know you are innocent	Yachanim mana huchayoq kasqaykita
He will be very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kanqa.
Everybody wants to do that.	Lliwmi chayta ruwayta munanku.
Maybe I’m waiting longer than this	Ichapas kaymanta aswan unayta suyachkani
Some people are lucky.	Wakin runakunaqa suerteyoqmi kanku.
I had to make sure it was him	Pay kasqanmanta seguro kanay karqa
I was the crazy one.	Ñuqam chay loco karqani.
Not so sure now.	Mana chayna segurochu kunan.
Not really sure why.	Mana chiqaptachu seguro imarayku.
Yeah, that one.	Arí, chay huknin.
Then I did, but probably not	Chaymantam chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manapaschá
It's useless now.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​kunan.
Maybe there’s something to that.	Ichapas chaypiqa imapas kanman.
Everything else is something.	Tukuy imapas imapas.
But not very often.	Ichaqa manan ancha askha kutichu.
That was absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Like everyone else in this city.	Kay llaqtapi llapa runakuna hina.
I knew he was doing the right thing	Yacharqanim allinta ruwasqanmanta
I couldn’t be that bad	Manam chay millay kayta atiymanchu karqa
I walked to school with him every day	Sapa punchawmi paywan kuska escuelaman puriq kani
So far, it seems.	Kunankamaqa, rikchakun.
I can do everything right.	Tukuy imata allinta ruwayta atiyman.
This was a confused confused confused confused confused.	Kayqa karqan pantasqa pantasqa pantasqa pantasqa pantasqa.
I couldn’t talk to anyone	Manam piwanpas rimayta atirqanichu
I never wanted time to pass	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu tiempo pasananta
He died a year later	Huk wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan
He told me everything was set.	Paymi niwarqa tukuy imapas churasqa kasqanmanta.
I want to learn more about it.	Chaywanmi astawan yachayta munani.
I know what he thinks	Yachanim ima piensasqanmanta
I know you still are	Yachanim kunankamapas chayna kasqaykita
I thought you did too	Ñuqapas yuyarqanim qampas chaynata ruwasqaykita
I could not hear anyone now	Kunanqa manam pitapas uyariyta atirqanichu
So many people.	Chaymi achka runakuna.
I can’t do anything about it now	Kunanqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
That is the most important thing.	Chayqa aswan importante ruwaymi.
I always thought so	Sapa kutim chaynata piensarqani
He was very clear.	Payqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
Then you go do that.	Chaymantaqa chayta ruwanaykipaq rinki.
You foolish people! 	¡Mana yuyayniyuq runakuna!
I don’t know how he’s going to do it yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu imayna ruwananta.
I never knew he was there	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa
There, or there, or there.	Chaypi, utaq chaypi, utaq chaypi.
This feeling good again.	Kay allin sientekusqanmanta yapamanta.
So she did her best to please him.	Chaymi tukuy atisqanman hina ruwarqa paywan kusisqa kananpaq.
Yes, this is the truth.	Arí, kaymi cheqaq kaq.
He began to speak.	Paymi rimayta qallaykurqa.
For three years there was nothing.	Kimsa watañam mana imapas karqachu.
But I can’t be sure	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atiymanchu
I never went home that night, I didn’t know why	Chay tutaqa manan hayk’aqpas wasiyman rirqanichu, manan yacharqanichu imarayku
Wherever there are people.	Maypipas runakuna kasqanpi.
I really can’t hold it	Chiqaptaqa manam hapiyta atiymanchu
It’s a fact.	Huk cheqaq kaqmi.
That should be a prerequisite.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kanan.
I certainly thought about it	Cheqaqtapunin chaypi yuyaykurqani
This happened here.	Kayqa kaypim pasarqa.
They want something.	Paykunaqa imatapas munanku.
I think he is still there	Kunankamapas chaypi kasqanmantam piensani
Now, this is something like that.	Kunanqa, kayqa imapas chayna.
Three times, in fact.	Kimsa kutita, chiqaptaqa.
I tried that but it didn’t work.	Chaytan ruwarqani ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
I want you to be better, that’s all	Aswan allin kanaykita munani, chaylla
This was the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
But he’s a good guy.	Ichaqa allin runa.
Or in the middle of the night.	Utaq kuskan tuta.
But he knew it would happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chay hina kananta.
And it went out again.	Hinaspa yapamanta lluqsirqa.
It was a big black guy.	Hatun yana kasqa.
Something you want but don’t want.	Imatachus munanki ichaqa mana munankichu.
I think he was afraid	Yuyaykuni manchakusqanmanta
I just know he’s a problem	Chaylla yachani payqa sasachakuy kasqanmanta
But he is not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
I don't understand why	Manam entiendenichu imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa
He could have gotten out earlier.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi lluqsiyta atinman karqa.
But I will do it soon	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwasaq
Never, you think.	Ama hayk’aqpas, yuyaykunki.
They’re the craziest.	Paykunaqa aswan loco kanku.
He could tell they were happy.	Payqa repararqanmi kusisqa kasqankuta.
I mean, it was a great night	Niyta munani, chay tutaqa ancha allinmi karqa
I didn’t see or hear anyone.	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu nitaq uyarirqanichu.
This baby.	Kay wawa.
He lives there now.	Chaypim kunanqa tiyan.
I know what the truth is	Yachanim ima chiqap kasqanmanta
That he wasn’t going anywhere.	Mana maymanpas risqanmanta.
No one has ever done that before.	Manan pipas chaytaqa hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
I wanted to talk to you	Qanwan rimayta munarqani
I wanted to ask him how he did it	Imayna ruwasqanmanta tapuyta munarqani
They aren’t really.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu kanku.
I don’t want to sit there with him	Manam munanichu chaypi paywan tiyayta
I couldn't have been here that long	Manam chayna unaytachu kaypi kayta atiyman karqa
I really don’t know	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu
I couldn’t see anything	Manam imatapas qawayta atirqanichu
I wish things weren't so safe	Munaymanmi imapas mana chayna seguro kananta
He's obviously upset.	Payqa sut'inmi llakisqa kashan.
Lots of things to do	Achka imakuna ruwanapaq
I won’t go if it’s there	Manam risaqchu chaypi kaptinqa
Maybe he was better.	Ichapas payqa aswan allin karqa.
But I didn’t see him	Ichaqa manan paytaqa rikurqanichu
I’m not really sure, it’s a good thing	Manam chiqaptachu seguro kani, allin kaqmi
I don't think it's there.	Manam chaypi kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
I know what time it is	Yachanim ima hora kasqanmanta
I can do everything you want to be.	Tukuy ima kay munasqaykita ruwayta atiyman.
I’ve always been this way	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi kayna karqani
You can do the same thing.	Qampas chaynatam ruwawaq.
Maybe everything will work out.	Ichapas tukuy imapas allin kanman.
If it ever does.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas chayta ruwan chayqa.
He said he’d drive there once a month.	Killapi huk kutita chayman carropi risaq nispas nisqa.
The ugly truth.	Millay chiqap kaq.
I knew nothing about it	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu
I can never leave it at that	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa saqiyta atiymanchu
I don’t like it right away.	Manam chayllachu gustan.
Very black, black, really.	Ancha yana, yana, chiqap.
This is the first time	Kaymi ñawpaq kuti
I thought it would be a good year.	Allin wata kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
I was okay with it	Allinmi karqani
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwanayta
He is a terrific man.	Payqa huk manchay runam.
I know who they are now.	Yachanim kunan pikuna kasqankuta.
I still didn't want to be with anyone	Kunankamapas manam piwanpas kaytaqa munarqanichu
I am sad and depressed.	Llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkani.
But it could have been worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
I couldn’t wait for anything	Manam imatapas suyayta atirqanichu
I can’t say the name for you	Manam sutinta niyta atiymanchu qampaq
They want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munanku.
I didn’t know you could do that	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
They are still the same today.	Kunankamapas chayna kachkanku.
What a treasure it was.	Ima qhapaq kaymi karqan.
Yes, it was too good to be true.	Arí, ancha allinmi karqa chiqap kananpaq.
It should take a few days	Iskay kimsa punchawmi ruwanan
The other is the name.	Huknin sutin.
Maybe it’s because he’s younger than me	Ichapas ñuqamanta aswan sullk’a kasqanmanta
Yes, every time.	Arí, sapa kuti.
I don’t see myself doing anything better	Manam rikunichu ñuqamanta aswan allin ruwaytaqa
I have heard him say that many times now	Kunanqa askha kutitan chayta nisqanta uyarirqani
I have been alone for a long time too	Ñuqapas unayñam sapallay kachkani
I am sure that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam seguro kani
He did this, for me.	Paymi kayta ruwarqa, ñuqapaq.
I didn’t know there were so many.	Manam yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta.
She had been so sure of him that night.	Chay tutaqa anchatan seguro kasqa paymanta.
It is better not to talk about it.	Aswan allinmi chaymanta mana rimayqa.
I thought really fast	Chiqamanta utqaylla yuyaykurqani
I have no idea how he knew about it.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynatam chaymanta yacharqa.
I don’t want to sit down.	Manam tiyayta munanichu.
They were all over the place.	Paykunaqa tukuy hawapi karqanku.
I hope that it is	Suyachkani chayna kananpaq
Or where this is.	Utaq maypichus kay kachkan.
I didn’t want to go out	Manam lluqsiyta munarqanichu
Actually, that’s a good thing.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa allinmi.
All were nonsmokers.	Llapallankum mana cigarrota pitaq karqaku.
I couldn’t understand it	Manam chaytaqa entiendeyta atirqanichu
I don’t have much time	Manam ancha tiempoy kanchu
I feel comfortable here	Kaypiqa allintam tarikuni
It never even existed.	Mana hayk’aqpas nitaq karqanchu.
He can't be here.	Payqa manam kaypi kayta atinmanchu.
And, a little bit of you.	Hinaspa, huk chikan qanmanta.
Really nice guy, though	Chiqamanta sumaq runa, ichaqa
I didn’t know what to do yet	Manaraqmi yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I thought that was really cool	Chayqa chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
It was very good for me.	Ancha allinmi ñuqapaq karqa.
Repeat this a few times.	Kayta iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
But there’s nothing there.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaypiqa kanchu.
He is just like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinam.
I would like this to happen.	Munaymanmi kay pasananta.
I knew he never would	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas ruwananta
I think that’s a great statement	Yuyaykuni chay rimayqa ancha hatunmi
A little bit of me	Huk chikan ñuqamanta
I do everything I can.	Tukuy imatam ruwani.
But the man will not be there for long.	Ichaqa chay runaqa manan unaytachu chaypiqa kanqa.
I know you want to talk.	Yachanim rimayta munasqaykita.
I think about this, all the time	Kaypi yuyaykuni, sapa kuti
I couldn’t see or hear anymore	Manañam rikuyta nitaq uyariyta atirqanichu
I find myself singing all the time, everywhere	Tukuy pacha, maypipas takiyta tarikuni
I don’t understand it.	Manam entiendenichu nispa.
It has been a wonderful day so far.	Kunankamaqa ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I never wanted to give up	Manam haykapipas saqiyta munarqanichu
He said it looks good.	Allinmi rikchakun nispas nirqa.
I am a good guy	Allin ruwaq runam kani
It makes it more real.	Aswan chiqap kananpaqmi ruwan.
That nothing happened.	Mana imapas pasasqanmanta.
You're doing fine without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa allintam ruwachkanki.
I was the first person, now	Ñawpaq kaq runam karqani, kunanqa
I wanted to go again, but I couldn't	Hukmanta riyta munarqani, ichaqa manam atirqanichu
He seemed kind of worried.	Payqa huk laya llakisqa hinam karqa.
Repeat this process.	Kayta yapamanta ruway.
He’s fast and big.	Payqa utqaylla, hatunmi.
I wonder why he is doing it	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwachkan nispa
I actually thought it was good	Chiqaptaqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I feel so proud to have him	Anchatan orgulloso sientekuni paywan kasqaymanta
Tell me about everything.	Tukuy imamanta willaway.
But after that, no more.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi manaña.
No, this was nice.	Manan, kayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Something bigger than me.	Imapas ñuqamanta aswan hatun kaq.
Like the name itself, in fact.	Kikin sutin hina, chiqaptaqa.
I know it's not true.	Yachanim mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
I have decided to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi tantearuni
Unless you are currently building one.	Manachus kunan hukta ruwachkanki chayqa.
And this is what will do.	Hinaspa kaymi ruwanqa.
I wouldn't be able to see them	Manam chaykunataqa qawayta atiymanchu karqa
He seemed kind of cold, actually.	Payqa huk laya chiri hinam karqa, chiqaptaqa.
I thought there was something wrong with that.	Chaywanqa imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I don't remember what happened in the past	Ñawpaqpi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam yuyarinichu
He couldn’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don't know exactly where it is.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I have seen this many times.	Kaytaqa achka kutitam rikurqani.
I don't know if it was ever yours	Manam yachanichu haykapipas qampa kasqanmantaqa
I take it to be late, early afternoon.	Tarde kananpaqmi hapini, tarde temprano kananpaq.
The first one may not work.	Ñawpaq kaqmi manapaschá allinchu kanman.
It was as good as ever.	Ñawpaq hina allinmi karqa.
I still can't believe you did that, out here	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu chayta ruwasqaykita, kay hawapi
Ten years younger than him.	Paymanta chunka wata sullk’a.
I knew he didn't need that kind of sleep	Yacharqanim mana chayna puñuyta necesitasqanmanta
I do that very often.	Chaytaqa ancha sapa kutim ruwani.
I want you to be there.	Chaypi kanaykita munani.
But I'm glad we did.	Ichaqa kusisqam kachkani chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I can’t stop remembering him	Manam payta yuyariyta saqiyta atiymanchu
First this, then that.	Ñawpaqtaqa kayta, chaymanta chayta.
I wonder what happened	Tapukuni imataq pasarqa
So far I’ve tried to stop him	Kunankamaqa hark’ayta munarqani
Really not sure what happened this time.	Chiqamanta mana segurochu kay kutipi imachus pasasqanmanta.
I couldn't believe how many things needed to be done	Manam creeyta atirqanichu hayka imakuna ruwana kasqanmantaqa
I hope everyone has a great day	Suyachkani llapallanku hatun punchaw kananpaq
I just can’t seem to walk	Chaylla mana puriyta atiymanchu hina
I can't wait to see him tonight	Manam suyayta atinichu kunan tuta payta qawayta
Not the only one, but the important one.	Mana sapallanchu, aswanpas importante kaqmi.
I never knew, really	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu, chiqaptaqa
This is still a process.	Kayqa kunankamapas huk ruwaymi.
I probably won’t go that long	Manapaschá chay unaytachu risaq
This is a very difficult one.	Kayqa llumpay sasam.
That's about it for now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa chaymantam.
This is like it is.	Kayqa hinam.
I don’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munanichu.
Here was one of them.	Kaypiqa hukninmi karqa.
I feel uncomfortable with it	Chaywanmi mana allintachu sientekuni
Don’t you think so?.	¿Manachu chayta yuyanki?.
He just did the job.	Chayllaraqmi chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
But I’m so excited.	Ichaqa anchatam kusikuni.
I saw it there.	Chaypim rikurqani.
I know how to play the game.	Pukllayta yachani.
That’s why he did it.	Chayraykum chayta ruwarqa.
I couldn’t help it, I didn’t want to help it	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu, manam yanapayta munarqanichu
I knew what he meant	Yacharqanim ima niyta munasqanmanta
Half a year.	Kuska wata.
And she said it wasn't.	Hinaspa payqa nirqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
Now it was ten years later.	Kunanqa chunka wata qhepamanmi karqan.
I was disappointed in that	Chaywanmi hukmanyasqa tarikurqani
I talked to him about it all the time	Chaymantaqa sapa kutim paywan rimaq kani
Being outside is not such a bad thing.	Hawapi kayqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
I’ve been doing that for a long time.	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I wonder how that will turn out.	Imaynataq chay kanqa nispam tapukuni.
I heard this for the first time	Kaytaqa ñawpaq kutitam uyarirqani
The new world.	Musuq pacha.
I feel very sad and depressed	Ancha llakisqa, llakisqa ima tarikuni
I don't care where it is.	Manam imananpaschu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
He did, finally.	Payqa ruwarqa, tukukuypi.
I think it will be good	Allinmi kanqa nispam piensani
I thought he was really smart	Chiqap yachaysapa kasqanmantam piensarqani
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runakunam karqa.
They’re injured.	Paykunaqa k’irisqa kanku.
There were a good many such people there.	Allin achka chayna runakuna chaypi karqaku.
I really wanted to	Chiqaptam munarqani
I did everything right	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwarqani
If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine.	Sichus mana rimayta munankichu chayqa, allinmi.
So he had to act quickly.	Chaymi chaylla imatapas ruwanan karqa.
I do a lot of swimming	Achkatam nadayta ruwani
I still couldn't speak	Kunankamapas manam rimayta atirqanichu
This can backfire very quickly.	Kayqa ancha utqayllam kutichiyta atinman.
I don't believe he will	Manam creenichu ruwananta
Everyone knows the truth.	Lliwmi yachanku chiqap kaqta.
I hope to respond in time.	Suyachkani tiempollanpi kutichiyta.
This is the present moment.	Kaymi kunan pacha.
I really want to correct my wrongdoing early	Anchatam munani mana allin ruwasqayta temprano allichayta
I have to make the last go	Qhipa ripuyta ruwanay tiyan
Please tell me the truth.	Ama hina kaspa, cheqaq kaqta willaway.
I wouldn't be here at all	Manam kaypichu kayman ni imapipas
That actually sounds like a perfect morning.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa huk allin paqarin hinam uyarikun.
But everyone knows his name.	Ichaqa llapa runan yachanku sutinta.
He is sad and depressed	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkan
No, indeed, it is.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin, chhayna.
He doesn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwan.
I couldn't believe it was so fast	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chaylla kasqanmantaqa
I will continue to be here	Hinallam kaypi kasaq
And that’s how you’re treated.	Hinaspa chay hinata qhawarisqa kanki.
We have been unhappy for such a very long time.	Chayna ancha unayñam mana kusisqachu kachkaniku.
Better you than me.	Aswan allin qanmi ñoqamanta.

I don't have time to tell you about it	Manam tiempoy kanchu chaymanta willanaypaq
I’m sorry for all of them	Llapallankum llakikuni
Just, you were there.	Chaylla, chaypi karqanki.
He really shouldn't have done it.	Chiqaptaqa manam ruwananchu karqa.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwanayta.
You may not want that, but you are.	Manapaschá chaytaqa munankichu, ichaqa qanmi kanki.
I thought you wanted me to be happy	Yuyarqanim kusisqa kanaypaq munasqaykita
You were a human being.	Huk runam karqanki.
I didn’t know about anything yet.	Manaraqmi imamantapas yacharqanichu.
Very tired, very tired of him	Ancha sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa paymanta
It was me, and he couldn't quit there	Ñuqam karqani, chaypim mana saqiyta atirqachu
He was eager to talk.	Payqa anchatam rimayta munarqa.
Ask him to say what he thinks.	Niy ima nisqanta rimananpaq.
I want to be happy here with him	Paywan kaypi kusisqa kayta munani
Better not to have it.	Aswan allinmi mana kananpaq.
I thought it was too much	Llumpay llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani
I would do the same thing if it were me	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwasaq ñuqa kaspayqa
I didn’t think so	Manam chayna piensarqanichu
This statement was not true.	Kay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
I didn’t want to see anyone	Manam pitapas rikuyta munarqanichu
You’re the one he wants to be with.	Qanmi kanki paywan kayta munan.
Really good at that.	Chiqamanta allin chaypi.
He was remarkably successful.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi allinta ruwarqa.
That was a good thing	Chayqa allinmi karqa
I couldn’t tell	Manam yachayta atirqanichu
He knows it will never happen.	Payqa yachanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayna kananta.
I knew no one would ever do it.	Yacharqanim mana pipas haykapipas ruwananta.
I’ve seen them before	Chaykunataqa ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani
There is a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runam kachkan.
We’re together.	Kuska kanchik.
I was a schoolteacher	Yachay wasipi yachachiqmi karqani
I was just so excited	Chayllam ancha kusisqa karqani
I didn’t know what to do, or where to go	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwanayta, nitaq mayman riyta

I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
I can barely hear him.	Paytaqa yaqapaschá uyarini.
But nothing will work out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
I would have been the same	Ñuqapas chayna kanman karqa
There was something else, something that wasn’t there before.	Huk imapas kasqa, imapas ñawpaqpi mana kaq.
These are people who do just that.	Kaykunaqa chaynata ruwaq runakunam.
They are eager to do so	Paykunaqa anchatam chayta ruwayta munanku
I’m never really the best	Ñoqaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu aswan allinqa kani
I said it was right	Allintam nirqani
It’s going to be really great.	Chiqaptam hatun kanqa.
I did the one in high school	Colegiopi kaqmi ruwarqani
Maybe that’s what it is	Ichapas chayna kasqanmanta
I am here almost every day	Yaqa sapa punchawmi kaypi kachkani
I never want to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaytaqa munanichu.
I’m the stupid one.	Ñuqaqa sonso kaqmi kani.
What a beautiful child.	Ima sumaq wawa.
I want him to know.	Pay yachananta munani.
We really can't talk about anything.	Chiqaptaqa manam imamantapas rimayta atichwanchu.
I saw him twice.	Iskay kutitam paytaqa rikurqani.
I have nothing to tell you.	Manam imatapas willanaypaq kanchu.
He is a busy man.	Payqa ocupasqa runam.
I wasn’t too happy either	Ñuqapas manam ancha kusisqachu karqani
His actions at the time were good.	Chay tiempopi ruwasqanqa allinmi karqa.
It was all about him.	Paymanta tukuy imapas karqa.
I think that's what this is	Chayqa kayqa kasqanmantam piensani
I didn’t mean anything by it	Manam chaywanqa imatapas niyta munarqanichu
I don't think so anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam chaytaqa piensanichu.
I hope there is nothing from this	Suyachkani kaymanta mana imapas kananpaq
I knew it wasn't going to be easy	Yacharqanim mana facilchu kananta
If only he could talk.	Sichus rimayta atinman karqan chayqa.
But, well, he’s as crazy as she is.	Ichaqa, allinmi, payqa pay hina loco.
I think ahead tonight	Kunan tuta ñawpaqmantaraqmi yuyaykuni
I felt sick all day	Tukuy punchawmi unqusqa tarikurqani
I’m not the only one who thinks so	Manam ñuqallachu chaytaqa piensani
He was quite serious.	Payqa allintam serio karqa.
And he meant this very seriously.	Hinaspa kayta ancha serio niyta munarqa.
No one could leave.	Manam pipas ripuyta atirqachu.
I can’t believe it	Manam creeyta atinichu
I know this is yours	Yachanim kayqa qampa kasqanmanta
I didn’t really want to be here	Manam anchatachu kaypi kayta munarqani
It was opened by a black man.	Chaytaqa huk yana runam kicharirqa.
He couldn't reach her.	Payqa manam chayayta atirqachu.
I need more coffee.	Aswan kukata necesitasaq.
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna karqan.
I wanted to be human.	Runa kaytam munarqani.
She was so beautiful at the time.	Payqa chay tiempopiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
No one could beat him.	Manam pipas atipayta atirqachu.
I have to do this	Kayta ruwanay tiyan
I know exactly where he is	Ñoqaqa allintam yachani maypi kasqanmanta
I thought someone was sick	Pipas unqusqa kasqanmantam piensarqani
He wanted to play alone.	Payqa sapallan pukllayta munarqan.
Why did it take this long?.	¿Imanasqataq kay unayta pasarqa?.
I still want to be that person.	Kunankamapas chay runa kaytam munani.
I couldn’t be foolish	Manam mana yuyayniyuq kayta atirqanichu
I’ll be there shortly	Pisi tiempollamantan chaypi kasaq
If the moment is right.	Chay rato allin kaptinqa.
I just didn’t know what to say	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu ima niyta
He wasn't really sure what he was afraid of.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu seguro kasharqan imamanta manchakusqanmanta.
I wasn’t there either.	Manam ñuqapas karqachu.
That’s pretty easy to do.	Chayqa ancha facilmi ruwanapaq.
I couldn’t sit down either	Ñuqapas manam tiyayta atirqanichu
It was sort of, you know.	Chayqa karqa huk laya, yachanki.
But much later than this.	Ichaqa aswan qhepamanmi kaymanta.
He did what he wanted to do.	Payqa munasqanman hinam ruwarqa.
Go ahead and do that.	Riy chayta ruwanaykipaq.
It’s better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi.
I wasn’t quite ready	Manam allintachu listo karqani
This week here, that week there.	Kay semana kaypi, chay semana chaypi.
It was always both.	Sapa kutim iskayninku karqa.
I think they are real now.	Yuyaykuni kunanqa chiqap kasqankuta.
Someone had to be there.	Pipas chaypi kanan karqa.
I wasn’t very good at it	Manam ancha allinchu karqani
He’s a good teacher, you know.	Payqa allin yachachiqmi, yachanki.
He wants to be like you.	Payqa qan hina kaytan munan.
He wanted to talk now.	Payqa kunan rimayta munarqa.
But he knew he was there.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t know this existed	Manam yacharqanichu kayqa kasqanmanta
He could never do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
I really, really mean it	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta niyta munani
I strongly disagree.	Ñuqaqa anchatam mana acuerdopichu kani.
Now I’ve seen the future more often	Kunanqa aswan askha kutitan hamuq tiempota rikurqani
I can have an opinion	Huk yuyayniyuq kayta atiyman
But everyone was disappointed.	Ichaqa llapallankum hukmanyasqa karqaku.
I have no idea where, or if, they are.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi, utaq sichus, kasqankuta.
I don’t know if you had to do that.	Mana yachanichu sichus chayta ruwanayki karqan chayta.
Now I was here alone about two hours ago	Kunanqa yaqa iskay hora ñawpaqtaraqmi sapallay kaypi karqani
I didn’t want to be here	Manam kaypi kayta munarqanichu
I don’t want to be like him	Manam pay hina kaytaqa munanichu
I wonder what happened to him	Tapukuni imataq paywan pasarqa
I wanted to see where he was.	Maypi kasqanmantam qawayta munarqani.
I didn’t want this to happen again	Manam munarqanichu hukmanta kay pasananta
I don’t know where he wants to go with that.	Mana yachanichu mayman chaywan riyta munasqanmanta.
I don’t have much time.	Manam ancha tiempoy kanchu.
I tried to do things	Imakunatapas ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
But that’s what he wanted.	Ichaqa chaytan payqa munarqan.
Does anyone know how to fix this problem?.	¿Pipas yachanchu kay sasachakuy allichayta?.
I can work on it.	Llamkayta atiyman.
I was there two years ago	Iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi karqani
I felt like he was mine	Payqa ñuqapa hinam tarikurqani
I can't see that happening	Manam chay pasananta qawayta atiymanchu
It’s the first step.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi.
I didn’t mean it that way	Manam chaynatachu niyta munarqani
There really is.	Chiqaptam kan.
Every night.	Sapa tuta.
I didn’t want to believe this was real	Manam creeyta munarqanichu kayqa chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I couldn’t say any more.	Manam astawan rimayta atirqanichu.
There is no time for it.	Mana tiempon kanchu.
Where it was supposed to be.	Maypichus kanan karqan.
I will never do anything	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwasaqchu
I want to do this right.	Kayta allinta ruwayta munani.
He’s as fucking good as anyone.	Payqa pi runa hinam millay allin.
If you can’t see it, don’t know what to say.	Sichus mana rikuyta atiwaqchu chayqa, ama yachankichu imatachus niyta.
He would be great.	Payqa hatunmi kanman.
I expect greatness	Hatun kaytam suyachkani
They were all right.	Allinmi karqanku.
This has happened many times.	Achka kutitam chayna pasarqa.
But that would be too soon.	Ichaqa chayqa nishuta usqhayllan kanman.
I can’t see him or anyone else.	Manam payta nitaq pitapas qawayta atiymanchu.
Maybe she went out with him.	Ichapas payqa paywan kuska lluqsirqa.
I just had a crazy idea	Chayllaraqmi huk loco yuyayniyuq karqani
He is no longer there.	Manañam chaypichu kachkan.
This happened recently.	Kayqa chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
There never is, not really.	Manam haykapipas kanchu, manam chiqaptaqa.
I wasn’t sure of anything anymore	Manañam imamantapas segurochu karqani
Every summer month.	Sapa chiri killapi.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chaytaqa ancha sumaqmi nispaymi piensarqani.
That is not true.	Chay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu.
Nobody wants those things.	Manan pipas chaykunataqa munanchu.
Anyone knows what happened.	Pipas yachanmi chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But how do I do this?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq kayta ruwasaq?.
No it isn’t like that.	Manan manan chay hinachu.
I didn’t want to leave him	Manam payta saqiyta munarqanichu
I think that was the worst part	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
And what a day it was.	Hinaspa ima punchawmi karqa.
We are not together.	Manam kuskachu kanchik.
I mean, no, not at all	Niyta munani, mana, ni imapipas
Being very good.	Ancha allin kay.
Don’t be like that.	Ama chay hinaqa kaychu.
I feel pretty good, actually	Allin allintam sientekuni, chiqaptaqa
I feel strongly about it.	Sinchitan sientekuni.
I don’t find it that way	Manam chaynataqa tarinichu
And not here.	Hinaspa mana kaypichu.
As fast as he can.	Atisqanman hina utqaylla.
I want to stay.	Qhepakuyta munani.
That’s what this is about.	Chaymantam kayqa rimachkan.
I am something else entirely	Ñuqaqa huk imapas llapanpim kani
He’s too big for you.	Payqa ancha hatunmi qampaq.
But it is not so sure.	Ichaqa manan chay hina segurochu.
He’s not sure he can.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan atisqanmanta.
It doesn’t always do that.	Manan sapa kutichu chayta ruwan.
Again, it wasn't very good.	Yapamanta, mana ancha allinchu karqa.
You need to do this step.	Kay llamk’ayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I have an early morning	Ñuqaqa kanmi huk temprano paqarin
He couldn't do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqachu chaymanta.
He can't leave.	Payqa manam ripuyta atinchu.
I didn’t really want to leave	Manam chiqaptachu ripuyta munarqani
I don't hear it very well here	Kaypiqa manam ancha allintachu uyarini
He wants nothing to do with me.	Payqa manan munanchu ñoqawan ima ruwaytapas.
Describe how great they are.	Willay imayna hatun kasqankuta.
Every fucking place.	Sapa millay maypi.
This would rather be good.	Kayqa aswan allinmi kanman allin kay.
But maybe.	Ichaqa ichapas.
That’s a good boy.	Chayqa allin wayna.
He did something wrong, and he knew it.	Payqa mana allintam ruwarqa, chaytam yacharqa.
I know you are very happy	Yachanim ancha kusisqa kasqaykita
That was probably the case at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
So it happened again.	Chaymi yapamanta pasarqa.
He noticed it.	Payqa repararqanmi.
He doesn’t care, not anymore.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, manañan.
Here's the thing, though.	Kaypim kachkan chay imapas, ichaqa.
I’m really happy to be here now	Chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani kunan kaypi kasqaymanta
I’d be that guy.	Ñuqa chay runa kayman.
He doesn’t care, of course.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, sut’inmi.
I wanted to know who this person was	Kay runa pi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
I couldn’t sleep, at all	Manam puñuyta atirqanichu, ni imapipas
I still think that's funny	Kunankamapas chaytaqa asikunapaq hinam piensani
And that’s what this is.	Hinaspa chaymi kay.
Anything good is a good thing.	Imapas allin ruwayqa allin ruwaymi.
I couldn't say how long	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka unayta
He couldn't wait for the news.	Manas chay willayta suyayta atirqachu.
He doesn’t want her in jail.	Manam munanchu carcelpi kananta.
I was like him, too.	Ñuqapas pay hinam karqani.
Since then, nothing.	Chaymanta pacha, mana imapas.
He was more than happy about it.	Payqa aswan kusisqan kasharqan chaymanta.
I want to know everything	Tukuy imata yachayta munani
He knew how to do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwayta.
I didn’t want to be rude	Manam mana allin rimaq hina kayta munarqanichu
That was the hard part.	Chayqa sinchi kaqmi karqan.
Unfortunately, this has been true for longer now.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa kunanqa aswan unayñam chiqap.
tell me.	willaway.
He is the best.	Payqa aswan allinmi.
I don’t want to stop it	Manam harkayta munanichu
I am happy to have him here.	Kusisqam kachkani kaypi paywan kasqaymanta.
One, at least.	Huk, aswanpas.
I really want to know.	Chiqamanta yachayta munani.
That’s what he wanted to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munarqan.
Ten years or something.	Chunka wata utaq imapas.
In the present tense.	Kay kunan pachapi.
Now don’t be foolish.	Kunanqa ama mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
I never did, anyway.	Manam haykapipas ruwarqanichu, imayna kaptinpas.
Perhaps he asked her to do so.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwananpaq nirqan.
I didn’t think anything like that would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna imapas pasananta
I think a lot of people are tired	Yuyaykuni achka runakuna sayk’usqa kasqankuta
I was a lot like you at the time	Chay tiempopiqa anchatan qan hina karqani
I never knew why	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I couldn’t bear to be so utterly alone	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu chayna tukuy imamanta sapallay kayta
You are always there for me.	Qamqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq kachkanki.
I wasn’t that surprised.	Manam chaynatachu admirakurqani.
Now he didn’t want to do it for her.	Kunanqa manañan paypaq ruwayta munarqanchu.
I certainly wouldn’t do that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta ruwaymanchu.
I didn’t know what to do about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanayta
I wasn’t sure where the house was	Manam segurochu karqani maypi wasi kasqanmantaqa
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
I couldn't stand it now	Kunanqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu
He knew why.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
I can’t tell you that yet	Chaytaqa manaraqmi willayta atiymanchu
They were ten of them.	Paykunaqa chunka karqanku.
But no one could leave.	Ichaqa manan pipas ripuyta atirqanchu.
What happened next, did.	Imataq chaymanta pasarqa, ruwarqa.
I don't see this.	Manam kayta rikunichu.
I had no time to do anything	Manam tiempoy karqachu imatapas ruwanaypaq
I can’t tell you.	Manam yachayta atinichu.
I wonder why he was here last night	Tapukuni imaraykutaq qayna tuta kaypi karqa
So now you know what happened.	Chaymi kunan yachanki imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I’m not sure about anything	Manam imamantapas segurochu kani
I have some really good ideas too	Ñuqapas wakin chiqap allin yuyayniyuqmi kani
I was cold, wet and miserable	Chiri, chiri, llakisqa ima karqani
He was a cigarette smoker.	Payqa cigarrota pitaq.
I think that would be the right thing to do	Chayqa allin ruwaymi kanman nispaymi piensani
So it took a while.	Chaymi huk rato pasarqa.
Didn't do very well with it.	Mana ancha allintachu ruwarqan chaywan.
I was pretty sure anyway	Imayna kaptinpas yaqa segurom karqani
That is why everything is confused here.	Chayraykum kaypi tukuy imapas pantasqa kachkan.
I won't be able to see where I am	Manam maypi kasqayta qawayta atisaqchu
He was happy to do so.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa chayta ruwaspa.
It’s not good for anyone.	Mana pimanpas allinchu.
He can’t sit in the front.	Payqa manan ñawpaqpi tiyayta atinchu.
The difficult moment.	Sasa kaq rato.
They are the best!!.	Paykunaqa aswan allin kanku!!.
Again, it’s just a matter of time.	Yapamanta, chayqa tiempollamantan.
Don’t know what’s wrong.	Ama yachankichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
They know it well.	Paykunaqa allintam yachanku.
I thought this would be good	Kayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi nirqani
But there is the problem.	Ichaqa kanmi chay sasachakuy.
I thought you were better than this	Kaymanta aswan allin kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I should have been happy	Kusisqam kanay karqa
I know you can't do that	Yachanim mana chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
I can't remember when.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu haykapi.
Everything was as described.	Tukuy imapas nisqa hinam karqa.
I didn’t know what he meant.	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta rimayta munasqanmanta.
I knew you didn't know where he lived	Yacharqanim maypi yachasqanmanta mana yachasqaykita
I didn’t want to see him	Manam payta qawayta munarqanichu
You have to do all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
He couldn't believe it.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqachu.
So everything went wrong	Chaymi tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa
I knew this was important	Yacharqanim kayqa ancha allin kasqanmanta
I wasn’t sure.	Manam segurochu karqani.
I want to, he says	Munani, nispas nin
I know it's hard for you	Yachanim qampaq sasa kasqanmanta
Can't really say why.	Mana chiqaptachu niyta atin imarayku.
I tried to catch him but I couldn’t	Payta hap’iyta munarqani ichaqa manan atirqanichu
I thought it was really great	Chiqap hatun kasqanmantam piensarqani
But he knows something.	Ichaqa imatapas yachanmi.
How can I do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwayman.
In fact, this can be quite serious.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa ancha hatunmi kanman.
It doesn’t exist now.	Manam kunanqa kanchu.
He’s good at it.	Payqa allinmi chaypiqa.
I don’t know why I feel better.	Manam yachanichu imanasqataq allinta sientekuni.
And he said this.	Hinaspa kayna nisqa.
And that’s very, very serious.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha ancha serio.
People, they don’t.	Runakunaqa, manam.
You know, it was really hard.	Yachanki, chiqaptam sasa karqa.
I really don't care about that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
That wasn’t a good thing	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa
That’s a very difficult thing.	Chayqa llumpay sasam.
He certainly couldn’t do that here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi mana chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
I didn't know there was more	Manam yacharqanichu aswan achka kasqanmanta
I couldn’t bear to be around him	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu paywan kuska kayta
I wonder about it a lot	Anchatam chaymanta tapukuni
Everyone is here.	Lliwmi kaypi kachkanku.
I have no idea what it could be	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima kanman chayta
I said okay and everything is fine.	Allinmi nispaymi nirqani tukuy imapas allinmi nispa.
He is mine, mine, mine.	Payqa ñuqapa, ñuqapa, ñuqapa.
I wasn’t comfortable there	Chaypiqa manam allinchu karqani
I think you know exactly what this is.	Yuyaykuni allinta yachanki imachus kay kasqanmanta.
It’s actually not bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam mana allinchu.
I look forward to hearing back.	Suyachkani kutichiyta uyariyta.
We’re great at that.	Chaypiqa hatunmi kayku.
Maybe that’s actually beauty.	Ichapas chayqa chiqaptaqa sumaq kay.
Twenty years ago, it was.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa, chayna karqa.
The more people there are, the more they want.	Aswan achka runakuna kaptinqa aswan achkatam munanku.
But there was no place for it.	Ichaqa manan chaypaqqa maypipas karqanchu.
To do that, it’s.	Chayta ruwanapaq.
It was obvious I wanted to	Sut’inmi karqan munasqayta
More and more.	Astawan astawan.
I don't really worry about that.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu llakikuni.
And you know, it wasn’t half bad.	Hinaspa yachanki, manan kuskan mana allinchu karqan.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
But it really is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin.
At first I didn’t know what to do	Ñawpaqtaqa manan yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
This doesn't do it.	Kayqa manam ruwanchu.
I have to do it right	Allinta ruwanay tiyan
And that’s what we did.	Hinaspa chaytaqa ruwarqayku.
I can’t wait to get out of there	Manam suyayta atinichu chaymanta lluqsiyta
He wants to answer.	Kutichiyta munan.
I was never quite right.	Manam haykapipas allintachu karqani.
Let me know if it works for you.	Qampaq allin kaptinqa willaway.
That’s not what I meant.	Manam chaytachu niyta munarqani.
I know there is someone out there for me	Yachanim chay hawapi pipas ñuqapaq kasqanmanta
He is rightly angry.	Payqa allintam phiñasqa kachkan.
I didn’t expect it to be difficult	Manam suyarqanichu sasa kananta
I thought that was a good thing.	Chayqa allin kananpaqmi piensarqani.
It was such a process.	Chayna ruwaymi karqa.
Great man, he said	Hatun runa, nispas nisqa
It’s so beautiful.	Chayna sumaq.
A month or two ago.	Killa iskay killa ñawpaqta.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chay ruwaytaqa munanichu.
It means something more.	Aswan imatapas niyta munan.
I didn’t really know about that	Chaymantaqa manam allintachu yacharqani
You can’t do that right.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu ruwawaq.
He opened it up.	Payqa kicharirqa.
But that may not be easy.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manapaschá facilchu kanman.
Of course, it’s not good.	Chiqamanta, mana allinchu.
I can’t quit now	Manam kunanqa saqiyta atiymanchu
A first, that’s for sure	Huk ñawpaq, chayqa seguro
I have no idea what happened	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
He’s like a big kid.	Payqa hatun wawa hinam.
I hope he does well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwananta.
But this will do the job.	Ichaqa kaymi chay llamkayta ruwanqa.
I want nothing to do with it	Manam munanichu chaywanqa ima ruwaytapas
He’s great, but they don’t know any better.	Payqa hatunmi, ichaqa manan aswan allintachu yachanku.
Everything was cold.	Lliwmi chiri karqa.
But there was no one, really.	Ichaqa manan pipas karqanchu, cheqaqtapuni.
I wasn’t good at this	Manam kaypiqa allinchu karqani
But this was supposed to be such a big deal.	Ichaqa kayqa chhayna hatun ruwaymi kanan karqan.
I need a good story this morning anyway	Kunan paqarin imayna kaptinpas allin willakuyta necesitasaq
I was like the sure thing.	Ñuqaqa seguro kaq hinam karqani.
I felt familiar somewhere	Maypipas riqsisqa hinam karqani
I was sure something was wrong	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin kananpaq
I didn’t want to be with him	Manam paywan kayta munarqanichu
That was the first challenging step.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq kaq sasa ruwaymi.
I knew it wasn't his real name	Yacharqanim mana chiqap sutin kasqanmanta
Certainly the most famous building.	Chiqamanta aswan riqsisqa wasi.
I want a good night sleep	Allin tuta puñuyta munani
It was hard not to be.	Sasam karqa mana chayna kayqa.
I don’t see who it is.	Manam rikunichu pi kasqanmanta.
But something went wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allintam pasarqa.
He was much more eloquent.	Payqa aswan allintan rimaq.
I saw him many times	Askha kutitan payta rikurqani
A wonderful man, indeed	Huk sumaq runa, chiqaptapuni
I wasn’t ready to be me	Manam listochu karqani ñoqa kanaypaq
Being good is not good.	Allin kayqa manam allinchu.
Make them for yourself.	Chaykunataqa qampaq ruway.
I’ve heard that	Chaytaqa uyarirqanim
I know there is so much for you.	Yachanim ancha achkata qampaq kasqanmanta.
We are fine tonight.	Kunan tutaqa allinmi kachkaniku.
I couldn’t say or do anything.	Manam imatapas niyta nitaq ruwayta atirqanichu.
I actually like this one better.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa aswan allintam gustan.
He would love to do it again.	Payqa anchatan munanman yapamanta ruwayta.
I didn’t do it right	Manam allintachu ruwarqani
I can’t leave it at that	Manam chaynataqa saqiyta atiymanchu
I wasn’t good either	Ñuqapas mana allinchu karqani
And, it probably is.	Hinaspa, yaqapaschá kanman.
I feel better this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi allinta sientekuni.
It will still do nothing.	Hinallam mana imatapas ruwanqachu.
But one person doesn’t.	Ichaqa huk runam mana.
I am a teacher, after all.	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kani, tukuy imamanta.
I can't work, sleep, or think.	Manam llamkayta, puñuyta, yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I don’t know who he is	Manam yachanichu pi kasqanmanta
He knows a way.	Payqa huk ñanta yachan.
And this process continues.	Hinaspa kay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
Eventually, it probably will.	Qhepamanmi yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
I can do that tomorrow	Chaytaqa paqarinmi ruwayman
I wanted to go out tonight	Kunan tuta lluqsiyta munarqani
Tell me a bit about that.	Chaymanta huk chhikanta willaway.
It's really quick.	Chiqaptam utqaylla.
I repeated this process three times	Kay ruwayta kimsa kutita yapamanta ruwarqani
He meant something himself.	Kikin imatapas niyta munarqa.
He looked like he wanted to.	Payqa munasqanman hinam rikchakurqa.
I didn’t want to eat	Manam mikuyta munarqanichu
The day passed by.	Chay punchawqa pasarqa.
I just can’t help it	Chaylla mana yanapayta atinichu
I feel like a new person now	Kunanqa musuq runa hinam tarikuni
Boy, that’s a real thing.	Wayna, chayqa chiqap imapas.
I know who they are now	Yachanim kunan pikuna kasqankuta
I can't stand it, man	Manam aguantayta atinichu, runa
I can’t answer if you are.	Mana kutichiyta atiymanchu sichus kanki chayqa.
I couldn’t be with him anymore	Manañam paywan kayta atirqanichu
That someone was me.	Chay pipas ñuqa karqani.
Find out how here.	Kaypi yachay imaynatachus chayta.
Yes, he can do that.	Arí, chaytan payqa ruwanman.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan ima ruwananta.
It would have been a summer evening.	Chayqa kanman karqan verano ch’isi.
He is easy to do.	Payqa facilmi chayta ruwayqa.
He’s been out there for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chay hawapi kashan.
I know that's really bad.	Yachanim chayqa chiqap mana allin kasqanmanta.
Nothing should be done in a hurry.	Manan imatapas usqhayllachu ruwana.
But I never did, like now	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwarqanichu, kunan hina
I hope to live there	Chaypi tiyayta suyachkani
Where there is more.	Maypichus astawan kachkan.
That would be the last thing.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi kanman.
I couldn’t hold it anymore	Manañam hapiyta atirqanichu
But he doesn’t think that’s the case.	Ichaqa manan chhayna kananpaqchu yuyaykun.
You are truly alone	Chiqaptam sapallayki kachkanki
Not scared or anything.	Mana mancharisqa nitaq ima.
I wasn’t happy with that	Chaywanqa manam kusisqachu karqani
That’s not a bad thing	Chayqa manan mana allinchu
There are three again.	Yapamanta kimsa kan.
But the fact remains.	Ichaqa chay cheqaq kaqmi kashan.
He thinks he needs to spend more time with you.	Payqa piensanmi qanwan astawan tiempota pasananta.
It always seems to be.	Sapa kutim yaqapaschá chayna.
I really want to know.	Anchatan munani yachayta.
I didn’t realize what he meant	Manam repararqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta
Yes, he is here.	Arí, payqa kaypim kachkan.
I didn’t think it was good enough	Manam allin kananpaqchu piensarqani
But everyone is very busy.	Ichaqa llapa runan ancha ocupasqa kashanku.
He did not go easy.	Payqa manam facilchu rirqa.
You’re doing really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwanki.
You certainly know that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yachanki.
You’re going to do this.	Qamqa kaytam ruwanki.
I really didn’t want him to know that	Cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanichu chayta yachananta
He can’t find anything.	Mana imatapas tariyta atinchu.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu.
I wasn’t sure he would	Manam segurochu karqani chayta ruwananmanta
He later died at the hospital.	Qhepamanmi chay hospitalpi wañupurqan.
I couldn’t wait for anything.	Manam imatapas suyayta atirqanichu.
I didn’t want to tell if it wasn’t good enough.	Manam willayta munarqanichu mana allin kaptinqa.
I mean, really bad.	Niyta munani, chiqap mana allin.
I fell in love with you that moment	Chay rato qanwan anchata munarqani
But how do you just do it.	Ichaqa imaynatataq chaylla ruwanki.
I want to make sure it's okay	Allin kasqanmanta seguro kaytam munani
Better go and learn.	Aswan allinmi riy hinaspa yachay.
It was too bad, too good.	Llumpay mana allin, allin kaqmi karqa.
I can probably say that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa niyta atiyman.
I was the one who did it	Ñuqam chayta ruwaq kani
I feel great.	Hatunmi sientekuni.
That’s what he thought.	Chaytan yuyaykurqan.
I still really want to see the movie.	Kunankamapas anchatam munani chay peliculata qawayta.
That lasted about ten years.	Chayqa chunka wata hinan karqan.
I know I am not the only one.	Yachanim mana ñuqallachu kasqayta.
I thought you were supposed to be here.	Yuyarqanim kaypi kanaykita.
Does it get any better than that?.	¿Chaymanta aswan allintachu tarikun?.
He is not the only one.	Payqa manan chayllachu.
I hope he comes home soon	Suyachkani chaylla wasinman kutimunanta
It’s not easy to do.	Manam facilchu ruwayqa.
I never wanted to go out	Manam haykapipas lluqsiyta munarqanichu
I couldn't get out of there fast enough	Manam chaymantaqa utqaylla lluqsiyta atirqanichu
I thought it was there	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensarqani
I think you’re crazy	Yuyaykuni loco kasqaykita
I don’t know where to go from here.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta mayman rinaypaq.
But there was one important thing.	Ichaqa huk importante kaqmi karqan.
I didn't think of that	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu
She glanced at him quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan payta qhawarirqan.
He did it very well	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqa
Maybe no one ever will.	Ichapas mana pipas haykapipas ruwanqachu.
I didn't know how many people there were	Manam yacharqanichu hayka runakuna kasqanmantaqa
I really have no idea how long that will last	Cheqaqtapunin mana yuyaykunichu hayk’a tiempo chay kananta
I think this is the problem	Kaymi chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
But I won’t be here	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kasaq
I’m one of them, too	Ñuqapas huk kaqmi kani
I don’t want to see him	Payta rikuyta mana munanichu
It’s just out there.	Chaylla chay hawapi kachkan.
Don’t overdo it.	Ama llumpayta ruwaychu.
Twice as fast.	Iskay kuti aswan utqaylla.
He didn’t really want to talk.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu rimayta munarqan.
I don’t know at all.	Manam ni imapipas yachanichu.
That meant you were the inferior	Chayqa niyta munarqa qanmi aswan pisi kasqaykita
I went there twice.	Iskay kutitam chayman rirqani.
There's a chance this could be true.	Kanmi chansa kayqa chiqap kanman.
Probably nothing.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas kanchu.
I wanted to talk more	Astawan rimayta munarqani
What is this?.	Imataq kay?.
I’m hurt as a human being	Runa hinam k’irisqa kani
Therefore, the first method is the worst.	Chayraykum ñawpaq ruwayqa aswan mana allinqa.
Not one, many.	Mana huk, achka.
He is a wise man.	Payqa yachaysapa runam.
I knew he liked to sing	Yacharqanim takiyta gustasqanmanta
That will be the worst.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
I did a bad job	Mana allintam ruwarqani
I had to act immediately.	Chayllam imatapas ruwanay karqa.
I couldn’t leave.	Manam ripuyta atirqanichu.
I wanted to eat him	Payta mikhuyta munarqani
I didn’t know what to say to anyone	Manam yacharqanichu pimanpas ima niyta
There was no time.	Manam tiempo karqachu.
That’s me, guys.	Chayqa ñuqam kani.
He had no intention of going.	Payqa manan riyta yuyaykurqanchu.
And that's if you get caught.	Hinaspa chayqa sichus hap'isqa kanki chayqa.
So we did a few different things.	Chaymi huk chikan chikan ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
One of them is very difficult.	Huknin kaqmi ancha sasa.
I am a stranger here	Kaypiqa mana riqsisqa runam kani
I don't know what's wrong	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I was never sure why	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I have no idea what just happened	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna chayllaraq pasasqanmantaqa
I can be very stupid.	Ancha sonso kayta atiyman.
He does, how.	Payqa ruwan, imaynatataq.
I know you want to help	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita
You really want to.	Chiqaptam munanki.
It was good to be known somewhere.	Maypipas riqsisqa kayqa allinmi karqa.
I haven’t tried this yet.	Manaraqmi kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
Learn more here.	Astawan kaypi yachay.
You have to do this for me.	Kaytaqa ñuqapaq ruwanayki tiyan.
I thought it was great there	Chaypiqa hatun kasqanmantam piensarqani
Okay, everything is fine.	Allinmi, tukuy imapas allinmi.
Then there are two things to do.	Chaymantaqa iskay ruwaymi kan.
No chance again.	Manaña chansa yapamanta.
Maybe I'm out for a while	Ichapas huk tiempo hawapi kachkani
But I probably should	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay
But no, not really.	Ichaqa manan, cheqaqtachu.
I can’t believe how stupid you are	Mana creeyta atiymanchu imayna sonso kasqaykita
Everything will be fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa
I knew you were gone.	Yacharqanim manaña kasqaykita.
Then a second one.	Chaymanta huk iskay kaq.
I’ve always wanted to know about it	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaymanta yachayta munarqani
But it just happened.	Ichaqa chayllam pasarqa.
Little did he know it would be the last.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu qhepa kaq kananta.
I am so proud of him	Anchatan paymanta orgulloso kani
I was very happy too	Ñuqapas ancha kusisqam karqani
The next season.	Qatiqnin pacha.
He can’t be serious.	Payqa manan serio kayta atinchu.
I really, really, am	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam, kani
I knew this would probably take some time	Yacharqanim kayqa yaqapaschá huk tiempota pasananta
I was amazed at how beautiful he looked	Chayna sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam admirakurqani
Hopefully the weather will be nice.	Munaymanmi pacha sumaq kananta.
If he had done this, if he had done that.	Sichus kayta ruwanman karqan, sichus chayta ruwanman karqan chayqa.
There they were.	Chaypim paykunaqa karqaku.
Yes, beautiful and good.	Arí, sumaq hinaspa allin.
I want to be that person	Chay runa kaytam munani
I always wanted to do other things	Sapa kutim huk ruwaykunata ruwayta munarqani
Wonderful.	Aswan sumaq.
Most of the time, it makes no sense.	Yaqa llapanpim mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I wasn’t the only one who felt that way.	Manam ñuqallachu chaynata tarikurqani.
I didn't really think this through	Kaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani
I thought you wanted this.	Kayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I said you’re crazy.	Loco kanki nispaymi nirqani.
He seemed very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa hinam karqa.
I don’t know, really.	Manam yachanichu, chiqaptaqa.
But one thing happened first.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi ñawpaqtaqa karqan.
I can’t help but feel a little disappointed	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu huk chikan hukmanyasqa tarikuni
I can't wait for that.	Chaytaqa manam suyayta atiymanchu.
If there is one.	Sichus kan chayqa.
Maybe he did it.	Ichapas pay chayta ruwarqa.
I know that you do.	Yachanim chaynata ruwasqaykita.
This is kind of interesting.	Kayqa huk laya sumaqmi.
I couldn’t think anymore.	Manañam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I really can't imagine him	Chiqaptaqa manam paytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I mean, everybody wants to do it.	Niyta munani, llapa runa ruwayta munanku.
Maybe it was true.	Ichapas chiqap karqa.
I’m so angry, hurt and confused	Ancha phiñasqa, k’irisqa, pantasqa ima kani
I wasn't ready to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa manam listochu karqani
I have a great mind and I am smart.	Ñuqaqa hatun yuyayniyuqmi kani hinaspa yachaysapa kani.
I didn’t want to be too mean	Manam ancha millay kayta munarqanichu
No one had any idea.	Manam pipas yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
He’s a little different.	Payqa huk chikan.
I knew that was wrong	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam yacharqani
I want to be like you	Ñoqapas qan hina kaytan munani
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kananta.
But he will do it one night.	Ichaqa huk tutam ruwanqa.
And that meant something.	Hinaspa chaymi imatapas niyta munarqa.
Said no one, ever.	Nisqa mana pipas, haykapipas.
He couldn’t believe it, he didn’t want to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu, manan creeyta munarqanchu.
Everyone is outside.	Lliwmi hawapi kachkanku.
I can’t watch it now.	Manam kunanqa qawayta atiymanchu.
I can’t quit now.	Manam kunanqa saqiyta atiymanchu.
I don’t think so.	Manam chaynataqa piensanichu.
I didn’t expect to see it	Manam suyarqanichu qawayta
Wherever that was, I was here	Maypipas chay kaptinqa kaypim karqani
Maybe it’s good for you.	Ichapas qampaq allin kanman.
I don't understand why he's alone	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa sapallan kasqanmanta
This, in fact, makes good sense.	Kayqa, chiqaptaqa, allin yuyayniyuqmi.
We did it right	Allintam ruwarqayku
I can’t hear him.	Manam paytaqa uyariyta atinichu.
I didn’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munarqanichu.
That's how I do I'm waiting for it to come.	Chaynatam ruwani hamunanta suyachkani.
But I didn’t want to	Ichaqa manan munarqanichu
I love talking a lot about everything	Tukuy imamanta anchata rimayta anchata munani
Everything is very fast.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam.
I couldn’t do it	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu
I am so sorry that this is the case.	Anchatam llakikuni kayna kasqanmanta.
I’m a little different.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan chikan kani.
A new challenge.	Huk musuq sasachakuy.
Nothing else can do it.	Manan imapas huk ruwayqa atinmanchu.
Obviously, this isn’t true.	Sut’inmi, kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I couldn’t leave now	Manam kunanqa ripuyta atirqanichu
But there was no reason.	Ichaqa manan imaraykupas karqanchu.
A year went by, then two.	Huk wata pasarqa, chaymanta iskay.
Happy to do that.	Kusisqa chayta ruwaspa.
I feel so lucky that way	Chay hinaqa ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni
Now that was interesting.	Kunanqa chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
The rich people.	Qhapaq runakuna.
I wanted to believe him	Payta creeyta munarqani
Great! 	Hatun!
you think.	yuyanki.
You’re rich.	Qhapaq kanki.
It’s too good to be true.	Ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq.
I really don't know why.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imarayku.
There were so many people there.	Chaypiqa ancha achka runakunam karqaku.
Who knows what will happen.	Pi yachan imapas pasananta.
Please, please	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa
And so it was.	Hinaspa chayna karqa.
You don’t know about anything.	Manam imamantapas yachankichu.
I mean	Niyta munani
I can’t believe he would	Mana creeyta atinichu chayta ruwananta
I didn’t think of that	Manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu
I can’t believe how beautiful you are	Mana creeyta atiymanchu imayna sumaq kasqaykita
Perhaps there was no time	Ichapas mana tiempo karqachu
And this is the core problem.	Hinaspa kaymi uma sasachakuy.
I couldn’t tell before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam willayta atirqanichu
Maybe it’s nice in the summer.	Ichapas chiri killapi sumaq kanman.
You probably want to be more than one.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta aswan askha kayta munanki.
I was there, you know	Chaypim karqani, yachanki
He can't talk now.	Mana kunan rimayta atinchu.
I really wanted to do it	Chiqaptam ruwayta munarqani
After a few moments he left	Iskay kinsa rato qhepamanmi ripurqan
I have never been able to do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa atirqanichu
I don't think he knew exactly what was going to happen.	Manam piensanichu allinta yacharqa imakuna pasananta.
While this is well known, it is completely wrong.	Kayqa ancha riqsisqa kaptinpas, llapanpim pantasqa kachkan.
It was all me.	Lliwmi ñuqa karqani.
This thing is amazing.	Kay imapas admirakuypaqmi.
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time	Unayñan kaypi yuyaykushani
Here is the action.	Kaypim ruwayqa kachkan.
It sounds nice.	Sumaqmi uyarikun.
He quickly took the city	Usqhayllan llaqtata hap’irqan
I can’t focus on that.	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
He wanted to be with her.	Payqa paywan kaytan munarqan.
You weren’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqanki.
I was never able to figure out the true nature of it	Manam haykapipas chiqap imayna kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu
It all felt so strange.	Tukuy imapas ancha mana riqsisqa hinam tarikurqa.
I couldn’t wait any longer	Manañam suyayta atirqanichu
I had to be tired	Sayk’usqa kanay karqan
I never knew there were so many	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta
And you’re me.	Hinaspa qamqa ñuqa kanki.
The process was very quick and efficient.	Chay ruwayqa ancha utqaylla hinaspa allin karqa.
Not nearly ready.	Mana yaqa listochu.
But not to anyone.	Ichaqa manan pimanpas.
I want you to be there	Chaypi kanaykita munani
I wanted to do everything I could to make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi tukuy imatapas ruwayta munarqani
I tried several times	Achka kutitam kallpanchakurqani
Maybe too much.	Ichapas anchata.
But it’s beautiful really.	Ichaqa sumaqmi cheqaqtapuni.
It makes for a better story.	Aswan allin willakuyta ruwan.
Many people are not good.	Achka runakunam mana allin.
I don’t know now.	Manam kunanqa yachanichu.
Then it happened.	Chaymantam pasarqa.
I just didn’t see how	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu imaynatachus chayta
Later, he.	Qhepamanmi pay.
I always knew when he was with her	Sapa kutim yacharqani haykapi paywan kasqanmanta
There was nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
You want to, but you have to do that first.	Munanki, ichaqa ñawpaqta chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I had no idea this happened	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasasqanmanta
I tend to agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayta munani.
I couldn’t bear to hang out with you and her.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu qanwan paywan kuska puriyta.
And here we are.	Hinaspa kaypi kachkaniku.
I think it will be good	Yuyaykuni allin kanqa
I certainly never expected that	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa suyarqanichu
So far that has been the most.	Kunankamaqa chaymi aswan achka karqa.
I still couldn't figure it out.	Kunankamapas manam yachayta atirqanichu.
I really don't know what.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imatam.
But there is no such easy way to do this.	Ichaqa manan kanchu hina facil ruway kayta ruwanapaq.
Being more reckless than that.	Chaymanta aswan mana yuyayniyuq kay.
This is a good thing though.	Kayqa allinmi ichaqa.
I have an idea where he might be	Ñuqaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani maypi payqa kanman
I didn’t expect anything to happen	Manam suyarqanichu imapas pasananta
I wonder how he feels now	Tapukunitaqmi kunan imayna sientekusqanmanta
You have no idea how to do everything.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki imaynatachus tukuy imata ruwanaykipaq.
He is a very serious man.	Payqa ancha serio runam.
He was nice to anyone.	Payqa piwanpas sumaqmi karqa.
I didn’t think of that either	Ñuqapas manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu
Can't wait to see her again.	Mana suyayta atinichu hukmanta payta rikuyta.
I wonder if it does	Tapukunitaqmi sichus chayta ruwan
I don’t want it to be any other way	Manam munanichu huk hina kananta
It went well for a while.	Huk tiempo allintam rirqa.
That would not have been easy.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
I think the fewer people, the better	Yuyaykuni aswan pisi runakuna kaptinqa aswan allinmi
Tell me something.	Imatapas willay.
I think he is a good man	Allin runa kasqanmantam piensani
He says he’s not sure.	Payqa mana segurochu kani nin.
But at least, it’s fine.	Ichaqa aswanpas, allinmi.
I am who I should be.	Ñuqam kani pichus kanan.
I didn't think he could keep up	Manam piensarqanichu chayman hina ruwayta atisqanmanta
An interesting new challenge.	Huk sumaq musuq sasachakuy.
I know what he wants to do	Yachanim ima ruway munasqanmanta
I was tired and frustrated	Sayk’usqa, hukmanyasqa ima tarikurqani
If you don’t, things will get worse.	Mana chayta ruwaptikiqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
He looked at the door.	Payqa punkuta qhawarirqan.
He was terribly frightened.	Payqa manchay mancharisqa kasqa.
I can’t let this chance pass	Manam kay chansa pasananta saqiyta atiymanchu
He spent the night in jail.	Chay tutan carcelpi qhepakurqan.
I wanted to be there.	Chaypi kaytam munarqani.
He was really good.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allin karqan.
But it’s much older.	Ichaqa ancha kuraq.
Yes, that was what it was supposed to be.	Arí, chaymi kanan karqa.
No, no one at all.	Manan, manan pipas ni imapipas.
He doesn’t look like much.	Payqa manan anchatachu rikch’akun.
I can't imagine how he's going to do that	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imaynatam chayta ruwanqa
Hard to say, no one really knows for sure.	Sasa niyta, mana pipas chiqaptapuni yachanchu seguro.
He was like a big kid.	Payqa hatun wawa hinam karqa.
There was nothing I could do about it	Chaymantaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I'm going to do that.	Chayta ruwasaq risaq.
She was really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
It should be serious.	Serio kanan.
Eventually I went there	Qhepamanmi chayman rirqani
This is so much better.	Kayqa ancha aswan allinmi.
It is still very fast.	Hinallam ancha utqaylla kachkan.
It was a bit different from everything else.	Tukuy imamanta huk chikan kasqa.
I feel better now	Kunanqa allinmi tarikuni
I didn’t know at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu
The result was a very successful one.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha allinmi karqa.
If you think about it, it will be good why.	Sichus yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi kanqa imarayku.
So, there it was.	Chaymi, chaypi kasqa.
And again, again.	Hinaspa yapamanta, yapamanta.
I couldn’t figure out what	Manam imamanta yachayta atirqanichu
But why is that the case?	Ichaqa, ¿imanasqataq chayna kaptinqa.
That didn’t mean there was nothing here.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu kaypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
He told me it meant so much.	Paymi niwarqa ancha achka niyta munasqanmanta.
I agree with you there	Chaypim qamwan acuerdopi kachkani
So much for being alone.	Anchata sapallan kasqaymanta.
I didn’t intend to do this	Manam kayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
I think he was a year younger than me	Yuyaykuni huk wata sullk’a karqan ñoqamanta
I can’t remember why	Manam yuyariyta atinichu imanasqa chaytaqa
He couldn't let go of what he knew.	Payqa manam saqiyta atirqachu yachasqanmanta.
You know it’s going to happen.	Yachankim chayna kananta.
I was worried about it all day	Tukuy punchawmi chaymanta llakisqa tarikurqani
Everything exists twice.	Tukuy imapas iskay kutitam kan.
I have never been able to block a door	Manam haykapipas huk punkuta harkayta atirqanichu
Everything but nothing.	Tukuy imapas ichaqa mana ima.
He’s not really there.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kashan.
He couldn’t be human.	Payqa manam runa kayta atirqachu.
After that, I thought about it	Chay qhepamanmi allinta yuyaykurqani
She was such a girl.	Payqa chayna sipasmi karqa.
I didn't know you looked like that	Manam yacharqanichu chayna rikchayniyuq kasqaykita
I would love to remember him	Anchatam munani payta yuyariyta
This is not easy	Kayqa manam facilchu
He is happy now.	Payqa kunan kusisqa kachkan.
I think something bad happened	Yuyaykuni huk mana allin kaq pasasqanmanta
Later this year.	Kay wata tukukuypi.
I really hope you might want to	Chiqamanta suyachkani ichapas chayta munanki
It’s a strong crowd.	Sinchi achka runakunam.
Everything worked out fine.	Tukuy imapas allintam lluqsirqa.
I can’t find it in town	Manam llaqtapi tarinichu
They want to have lunch afterwards.	Chay qhepamanmi almuerzota mikuyta munanku.
If so, he could not see it.	Chayna kaptinqa manam qawayta atirqachu.
Yes, be quick.	Arí, usqhaylla kay.
Once and a half, in fact.	Huk kuti kuskan, chiqaptaqa.
I wasn’t quite sure what I was going to do this morning	Manam allintachu yacharqani kunan paqarin imata ruwanayta
I want to see him tomorrow	Paqarinmi payta rikuyta munani
I wish it was me, though	Munaymanmi ñuqa kayta, ichaqa
He is not there now.	Kunanqa manam chaypichu kachkan.
They are not like that at all.	Paykunaqa manan chay hinachu kanku ni imapipas.
I wanted something more	Astawan imatapas munarqani
Head injuries are another thing	Uma k’irisqa kayqa huk imapas
It looked really great.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq rikchakurqa.
I just can’t answer	Chaylla mana kutichiyta atiymanchu
He didn’t ask much about this	Payqa manan anchatachu kaymanta tapurqan
I didn’t know how to do it	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta
That was the first and most important thing.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq kaq, aswan importante kaq.
He actually wanted this thing bad.	Payqa chiqaptaqa kay imapas mana allintam munarqa.
I want to be happy	Kusisqa kaytam munani
I wanted to hear from him all week	Tukuy semanan paymanta uyariyta munarqani
I thought it was very real	Ancha chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani
I never realized why	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu imarayku kasqayta
I can’t do that for you	Manan chaytaqa qanpaq ruwaymanchu
To talk to him.	Paywan rimananpaq.
I want to be there too	Ñuqapas chaypim munani
But you have to do something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi ruwanayki.
I mean it’s just not there.	Niyta munani chaylla mana chaypichu kachkan.
He couldn't tell that.	Mana chayta willayta atirqachu.
And being sure.	Hinaspa seguro kaspa.
Why are we the ones.	¿Imanasqataq kanchik.
I just haven’t found it yet	Chayllaraqmi manaraq tarinichu
I mean, really be with him	Niyta munani, chiqaptapuni paywan kay
Hopefully, it will be.	Munaymanmi, chayna kananta.
A few days ago.	Iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi.
You think you’re doing the right thing.	Allinta ruwasqaykita yuyanki.
I just couldn’t sleep	Chaylla mana puñuyta atirqanichu
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
I did this walk all day	Tukuy punchawmi kay puriyta ruwarqani
I didn’t want to know what was going on	Manam imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munarqanichu
I would be fine now	Kunanqa allinmi kayman
I didn’t do that either	Ñoqapas manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
That’s the second thing.	Chayqa iskay kaq kaqmi.
I didn’t do anything to tell anyone	Manam imatapas ruwarqanichu pimanpas willanaypaq
It felt like nothing.	Mana imapas hinam tarikurqa.
And then it goes again and again and again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta rin.
I wish it happened again last year	Qayna wata yapamanta kananta munayman
You know you did it.	Yachankim chayta ruwasqaykita.
But I don’t like it	Ichaqa manan gustawanchu
And then he knew.	Hinaspa chaymanta yacharqa.
Nothing to that.	Mana imapas chaymanqa.
I can do this well	Kaytaqa allintam ruwayman
You know, big deal.	Yachanki, hatun ruway.
This would be a good thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi kanman.
This was more of a building project than anything else.	Kayqa aswan huk wasi ruwaymi karqan imamantapas.
I didn’t want to know any more	Manañam astawan yachayta munarqanichu
I feel more comfortable with him	Aswan allintam sientekuni paywan kuska
That would have been the case.	Chayna kanman karqa.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki tiyan.
I don’t know anyone here	Kaypiqa manam pitapas riqsinichu
That’s really important here.	Chayqa kaypiqa ancha allinmi.
It sits there, all right.	Chaypim tiyan, allinmi.
Obviously that wasn’t the case here.	Sut’inmi kaypi mana chay hinachu karqan.
This is all a process.	Kayqa tukuy imapas huk ruwaymi.
Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later	Munaymanmi aswan utqaylla kananta aswan tarde kananpaq
I’m not like him.	Manam pay hinachu kani.
Such a nice guy.	Chayna sumaq runa.
I'll do it today.	Kunanmi ruwasaq.
How clever.	Imayna yachaysapa.
I tried to do a good job	Allin llamkayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
So that’s all.	Chaymi chaymi llapan.
I would love to live there.	Chaypi tiyayta anchata munani.
He looks serious.	Payqa serio hinam rikchakun.
I know exactly what he thinks	Allintam yachani ima piensasqanmanta
There is one important thing to do	Huk importante ruwaymi kan
No higher education.	Mana hatun yachay wasipi yachay.
He did it that night.	Chay tutam chayta ruwarqa.
That would be the coffee.	Chayqa kanman karqan chay kukata.
He likes money.	Payqa qolqetan gustan.
I feel very bad about it.	Ancha mana allintam chaymantaqa sientekuni.
I learned so much from him, him and me	Paymanta, paymanta ñuqamanta ima, anchata yacharqani
That was always the worst part.	Chayqa sapa kutim aswan mana allinqa karqa.
I hope all is well with you	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananpaq qampaq
Maybe I was a little mean	Ichapas huk chikan millay karqani
I knew he meant it	Yacharqanim chayna niyta munasqanmanta
The first night.	Ñawpaq kaq tuta.
I thought that was really interesting	Chaytaqa ancha sumaqmi nispaymi piensarqani
I want him to come home.	Munani wasinman kutimunanta.
I still didn't know how to get out of it	Kunankamapas manam chaymanta lluqsiyta yacharqanichu
But there is no such thing there.	Ichaqa manan chaypiqa chay hinaqa kanchu.
I saw him this morning	Kunan paqarinmi payta rikurqani
You can't stop them.	Chaykunataqa manam harkayta atiwaqchu.
I doubt it’s that important	Iskayrayani chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta
He could never find her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas tariyta atirqanchu.
I did that most of the day.	Chaytaqa yaqa tukuy punchawmi ruwarqani.
But then I heard it right	Ichaqa chaymantaqa allintam uyarirqani
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Manan facil ruwaychu.
I knew you were there or lived there	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqaykita utaq chaypi yachasqaykita
I hear it every day	Sapa punchawmi uyarini
It was a terrible time.	Manchay tiempota pasarqa.
That may not be true.	Chayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu.
He knew though.	Payqa yacharqanmi ichaqa.
He knew the story well.	Payqa allintam yacharqa chay willakuyta.
He may be right but wrong.	Payqa allinmi kanman ichaqa pantasqa.
And so here it was.	Hinaspa chayna kaypi karqa.
I can’t let that happen.	Manam chayna kananta saqiyta atiymanchu.
I didn’t want him to come with me	Manam munarqanichu ñuqawan hamunanta
I was very sure.	Ancha segurom karqani.
This seems almost unlikely.	Kayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu kanman hina.
It would be wonderful to do so.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
I know you have always wanted to go there	Yachanim chayman riyta haykapipas munasqaykita
I didn’t expect that at all	Manam chaytaqa imapipas suyarqanichu
I wish he was here with me right now	Munaymanmi kunanpacha kaypi ñuqawan kananta
I want to do this right	Kaytaqa allintam ruwayta munani
I'm not sure what's wrong	Manam segurochu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta
Yes, it was great.	Arí, hatunmi karqa.
A true man does what he has to do	Cheqaq runaqa imachus ruwananta ruwan
That’s what we had to do first.	Chaytan ñawpaqtaqa ruwanayku karqan.
I know what night.	Yachanim ima tuta.
And this morning.	Hinaspa kunan paqarin.
I can't imagine what's wrong	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa
He said it wasn't.	Payqa nirqam mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He is with her now.	Payqa kunanmi paywan kachkan.
I wonder how he did it	Tapukuni imaynatataq chayta ruwarqa
Otherwise, it makes no sense.	Mana chayna kaptinqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I have no idea who he is	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu pi kasqanmanta
This thing did it.	Kay imapas ruwarqa.
You can’t afford to fail.	Manan atiwaqchu mana allinta ruwanaykipaqqa.
We used it for a great evening meal.	Chaywanmi hatun ch’isi mikhunata ruwaq kayku.
I can't catch it yet	Manaraqmi hap'iyta atinichu
I know it’s not right	Yachanim mana allin kasqanta
Looks like someone might be fired.	Pipas qarqusqa kanman hinam rikchakun.
I kept learning.	Hinallam yacharqani.
The last one.	Qhipa kaq.
Or everything else.	Utaq tukuy imapas.
I know that for a fact	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin yachani
And he’s there.	Hinaspa payqa chaypi kachkan.
How true, now.	Imayna chiqap, kunan.
I couldn't think of anything that night	Chay tutaqa manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
The second one was good.	Iskay kaqmi allin karqa.
I want her to be happy again	Munani hukmanta kusisqa kananta
Every hour of every day.	Sapa hora sapa punchaw.
You know that, man.	Chaytaqa yachanki, runa.
You can’t stop it.	Manam harkayta atiwaqchu.
I knew they were all players	Yacharqanim llapallanku pukllaq kasqankuta
There was nothing that could have made this better.	Manam imapas karqachu kayta aswan allinta ruwananpaqqa.
I feel good, that’s all	Allinmi sientekuni, chaylla
You can’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I think you just have to do it	Chaylla ruwanayki kasqanmantam piensani
He was happy now, very happy.	Payqa kunan kusisqa kasqa, ancha kusisqa.
He knows it’s your favorite.	Payqa yachanmi aswan munasqayki kasqanmanta.
It was really hard	Chiqaptam sasa karqa
That would be later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi kanman.
I am your wisdom	Ñuqam kani yachaysapa kasqaykita
He was about it.	Payqa chaymantam kachkarqa.
Indeed, that was once the case.	Cheqaqtapunin huk kutipi chhayna karqan.
I didn’t realize it was such a problem	Manam repararqanichu chayna sasachakuy kasqanmanta
I want it to be a good time	Munani allin tiempo kananta
I just couldn’t tell	Chaylla mana willayta atirqanichu
I know what they are like.	Yachanim imayna kasqankuta.
I didn’t know it was him	Manam yacharqanichu pay kasqanmanta
There were people.	Runakunam karqa.
He may not want to listen.	Manapaschá uyariyta munanmanchu.
He is here with me now.	Kunan ñuqawan kaypi kachkan.
I couldn’t imagine what was involved	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta
But I really wanted to see it	Ichaqa anchatam qawayta munarqani
But it certainly isn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu.
I had to get busy again	Hukmanta ocupasqa kanay karqa
I couldn’t understand why things were happening	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imarayku imapas kasqanmanta
Maybe two, three years ago.	Ichapas iskay, kimsa wata ñawpaqta.
He can't walk without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa manam puriyta atinmanchu.
That was about two years ago.	Chayqa yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I didn’t want to end up like him	Manam pay hinachu tukuyta munarqani
You are going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanaykipaqmi rinki.
He had considered it now.	Payqa kunanmi chayta qhawarisqa.
Then I wanted to ask him	Chaymantam payta tapuyta munarqani
I almost didn’t see it	Yaqapaschá mana rikurqanichu
That was difficult, very difficult.	Chayqa sasa karqa, ancha sasa.
I didn’t see this coming at all	Manam rikurqanichu kay hamunanta ni imapipas
I was exhausted too	Ñoqapas sayk’usqañan karqani
No one ever does that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
And that’s what it means.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munan.
That would probably mean he was gone.	Chaywanqa yaqapaschá manaña kasqanmanta niyta munanman.
And then do it again.	Hinaspa chaymanta hukmanta ruway.
Saying this.	Kayta nispa.
I want to be positive	Allin yuyayniyuq kaytam munani
I can, you know that	Ñuqaqa atiyman, chaytaqa yachanki
I thought he was handsome	Ñuqaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I wanted to do the truth	Chiqap kaqta ruwayta munarqani
He was the last one.	Payqa qhepa kaqmi karqan.
I can’t do anything about that.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t remember him not being there	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu mana chaypi kasqanmanta
He knew he was under arrest.	Payqa yacharqanmi hap’isqa kasqanmanta.
I knew you meant it	Yacharqanim chayna nisqaykita
I didn’t know how to walk	Manam puriyta yacharqanichu
It’s better than being there.	Aswan allinmi chaypi kaymantaqa.
One way and another way.	Huk hinata huk hinata.
Unfortunately he couldn't ask.	Llakikuypaqmi mana tapuyta atirqachu.
Really really excited.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta kusisqa.
That shouldn’t be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Maybe, maybe so, I should do better next time	Ichapas, ichapas chaynata, hamuq kutipi aswan allinta ruwanay
That is, .	Kaymi, .
It sounds ridiculous now, but it was very serious at the time.	Kunanqa asikunapaq hinam uyarikun, ichaqa chay tiempopiqa ancha serio karqa.
We're kind of busy here.	Kaypiqa huk laya ocupasqa kachkaniku.
I knew it all along	Tukuy tiempon chaytaqa yacharqani
I don’t know what it is	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
I thought about it all day and all night	Tukuy punchawmi tukuy tutan chaypi piensarqani
In fact, he was no longer sure of anything.	Aswanpas manañan imamantapas segurochu kasharqan.
So this is what it’s going to be like.	Chaymi kayna kanqa.
I did the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwarqani
He certainly will though.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ichaqa ruwanqa.
Please let me know if you've ever been at a party.	Ama hina kaspa, willay sichus hayk'aqllapas huk fiestapi karqanki.
No one said it would be easy.	Manan pipas nirqanchu facil kananta.
Two very large men.	Iskay ancha hatun runa.
I can’t remember anything	Manam imatapas yuyariyta atinichu
I couldn’t ask him why	Manam tapuyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
You really should do that.	Chiqamanta chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
This would be almost too good to be true.	Kayqa yaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I want to be better	Aswan allin kaytam munani
I mean by this, we did last night	Kaymanta niyta munani, qayna tuta ruwasqaykumanta
I’m not sure what the big deal is	Manam segurochu kani ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta
Or he did, once.	Utaq ruwarqan, huk kuti.
I knew this would happen	Yacharqanim kay pasananta
The truth was more interesting.	Cheqaq kaqmi aswan sumaq karqan.
I can make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwayman
Tell me a story.	Huk willakuyta willaway.
They were really nice.	Paykunaqa chiqap sumaqmi karqaku.
I don’t know what.	Mana yachanichu imata.
He’s going to be a player.	Payqa pukllaqmi kanqa.
I haven’t found it yet.	Manaraqmi tarinichu.
By doing that.	Chayta ruwaspa.
I didn’t know he was here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta
He was the innovator.	Paymi chay mosoq kaqta ruwaq.
I will not do that here	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwasaqchu
And do it hard.	Hinaspa sinchita ruway.
And then he is.	Hinaspa chaymanta payqa.
I know when to say no	Yachanim haykapi mana niyta
A learning day.	Huk yachay punchaw.
But I didn’t want you to get hurt.	Ichaqa manan munarqanichu k’irisqa kanaykita.
If he wanted to be a kid, fine.	Sichus wawa kayta munarqan chayqa, allinmi.
Now I want to know everything	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachayta munani
I want it like crazy	Loco hinam munani
Tom would never be good enough.	Tomqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
I can't think about that right now	Chaypiqa manam kunanqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I didn’t feel guilty.	Manam huchayoq hinachu tarikurqani.
I didn’t know what to make of this	Manam yacharqanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq
You cannot leave them out.	Chaykunataqa manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
I almost want him to	Yaqapaschá munani chayta ruwananta
He provided a way.	Paymi huk ñanta qorqan.
Soon you will be speechless.	Pisi tiempollamantan manaña rimayta atiwaqchu.
I almost can't stand being here anymore	Yaqa manañam kaypi kayta aguantayta atinichu
They are both sick.	Iskayninkum unqusqa kachkanku.
That will be more obvious.	Chayqa aswan sut’inmi kanqa.
I did the whole process again.	Tukuy chay ruwayta yapamanta ruwarqani.
I never did anything like him	Manam haykapipas pay hinaqa ruwarqanichu
I wanted to be human	Runa kaytam munarqani
Each and every day.	Sapa punchaw hinaspa sapa punchaw.
This will not come often.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu hamunqa.
I hope you enjoy it	Suyachkani kusisqa kanaykita
That doesn’t really make me feel good.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu allinta sientekuni.
The man who.	Chay runa.
I can’t say what will happen	Manam niyta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta
It was the first one.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
But I really can’t comment on that	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
I have an idea of ​​what happened	Ñuqaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani imakuna pasasqanmanta
It just doesn’t make any sense to me.	Chaylla mana ima yuyayniyuqchu ñuqapaq.
I already agree.	Ñam acuerdopi kani.
I’m not in it right now.	Manam kunanqa chaypichu kachkani.
He is afraid to do anything.	Payqa manchakunmi ima ruwaytapas.
I didn’t see it all being good	Manam rikurqanichu tukuy imapas allin kananpaq
Can't let that happen.	Mana chay pasananta saqiyta atinchu.
I wasn't sure which one it was	Manam allintachu yacharqani mayqin kasqanmantaqa
It can be serious.	Serio kanman.
He can't hold it, really.	Payqa manam hapiyta atinchu, chiqaptaqa.
I almost didn’t want to	Yaqapaschá mana munarqanichu
I was terrified the whole time	Tukuy tiempon mancharisqa karqani
New people.	Musuq runakuna.
Nothing really big.	Mana imapas chiqap hatun.
But he didn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
He was alright though.	Payqa allinmi karqan ichaqa.
I want to be at home.	Wasipi kaytam munani.
I would love to know what it’s like	Anchatan munani imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
He passed last year.	Payqa qayna wata pasarqa.
He wanted her to succeed.	Payqa munarqanmi allinta ruwananta.
But now he is in trouble.	Ichaqa kunanmi sasachakuypi tarikun.
I'm lucky	Suerteyoqmi kani
I don't mean anything by that.	Chaywanqa manam imatapas niyta munanichu.
Soon it won’t be so bad.	Pisi tiempollamantan manaña chhayna mana allinchu kanqa.
But not yet, yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi, kunankamapas.
I was with him all day	Tukuy punchawmi paywan karqani
It is a very important thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I thought it was sad	Llakikuypaqmi nispaymi piensarqani
I could not have been happier.	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu karqa.
I think this could be it	Kaymi kanman, nispaymi yuyaykuni
He thinks things through.	Payqa imakunatapas allintan yuyaykun.
This should be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanan.
I am, of course, worried about it	Ñuqaqa, chiqamanta, chaymanta llakikuni
Things were really good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinmi karqa.
But no, seriously.	Ichaqa manan, serio.
This was a fairly innovative approach.	Kayqa allin musuq ruwaymi karqa.
But that makes no sense.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa imapaqpas valenchu.
I don’t feel too comfortable	Manam llumpay allinchu tarikuni
I’m a bad person.	Mana allin runam kani.
I was happier than ever	Aswan kusisqam karqani
I meant it right.	Allintam niyta munarqani.
I have no idea what’s in there	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna chaypi kasqanmanta
I didn’t know how to do it or what to say	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta nitaq ima niyta
But you did it.	Ichaqa qanmi ruwarqanki.
Maybe you want to make a movie or something.	Ichapas huk peliculata ruwayta munanki utaq imatapas.
I’m a good guy	Allin runam kani
I know she is beautiful, and handsome	Yachanim sumaq kasqanmanta, hinaspa sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta
I knew how he felt	Yacharqanim imayna sientekusqanmanta
I never knew that before.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa yacharqanichu.
I always wanted to be a builder, you know	Sapa kutim wasi ruwaq kayta munarqani, chaytaqa yachanki
I did and then he started thinking	Chaynatam ruwarqani chaymantam yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa
I wonder why he did that	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa nispa
I can’t tell what he wants	Manam willayta atinichu ima munasqanmanta
I did that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwaq kani.
I didn’t feel guilty	Manam huchayoq hinachu tarikurqani
I want to know all about it	Tukuy chayta yachayta munani
In fact, it’s like you are.	Chiqaptaqa qampas hinam.
Not not how.	Mana mana imayna.
Never done it before.	Mana hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanchu.
Soon enough, yes.	Pisi tiempollamantan, arí.
I want her to be happy	Kusisqa kananpaqmi munani
I wasn’t really hungry	Manam chiqaptachu yarqasqa karqani
There’s a.	Chaypin huk.
Very realistic looking.	Ancha chiqap rikchayniyuq.
I want to help you do that.	Chayta ruwanaykipaqmi yanapayta munani.
I really can’t believe it	Cheqaqtapunin mana creeyta atiymanchu
The truth was, it had to be.	Chiqap kaqmi karqa, chayna kanan karqa.
Not sure what he needs.	Mana segurochu ima necesitasqanmanta.
I doubt it very much.	Anchatam iskayrayani.
That’s what you think about all the time.	Chaytan sapa kutilla yuyaykunki.
I knew who they were	Yacharqanim pikuna kasqankuta
I don’t feel happy.	Manam kusisqachu tarikuni.
This is often a good thing.	Kayqa achka kutipi allinmi.
Do something better.	Imatapas aswan allinta ruway.
But now it’s easier.	Ichaqa kunanqa aswan facilmi.
I think I’ll say his name	Sutinta niyta yuyaykuni
I am a much older person now	Kunanqa aswan kuraq runam kani
More, actually.	Aswan, chiqaptaqa.
I know this is not going to be easy	Yachanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta
I really hope not	Chiqaptam suyachkani mana
They are all older than you.	Llapallankum qammanta aswan kuraq kanku.
And they want to go.	Hinaspa riyta munanku.
There will be someone else next month.	Hamuq killapi huk runa kanqa.
But it failed miserably.	Ichaqa sinchitan mana allintachu ruwarqan.
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him	Manam pay kaptinqa kunan punchawqa manam kaypichu kayman
She would never be alone again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu kanman karqan.
I know how hard this is	Yachanim kay imayna sasa kasqanmanta
I feel really bad about it	Chiqamanta mana allintachu chaymanta sientekuni
I still couldn't get out	Hinallam mana lluqsiyta atirqanichu
She was such a good girl.	Payqa chayna allin sipasmi karqa.
I knew this was going to be bad	Yacharqanim kayqa mana allin kananta
I’m sorry about that	Chaywanmi llakikuni
One can never be sure.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas seguro kayta atinmanchu.
I just don’t know.	Chaylla mana yachanichu.
I could be wrong about everything	Tukuy imamanta pantasqa kayman
He sure didn’t need another cup of coffee.	Payqa seguro mana huk kukata necesitarqanchu.
It should be easy after all.	Tukuy imamanta facilmi kanan.
I didn't want anyone to get hurt	Manam munarqanichu pipas k'irisqa kananta
That would be a very good thing	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman
I almost can't stand it anymore	Yaqa manañam chaytaqa aguantayta atinichu
I know they are here somewhere	Yachanim maypipas kaypi kasqankuta
No, this is not a good thing.	Manan, kayqa manan allinchu.
I saw him a while ago.	Paytaqa huk rato ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani.
It’s going to be nice.	Sumaqmi kanqa.
Probably more than one.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta aswan achka.
But of course that wasn’t true.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
But of course it wasn’t, not yet.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana karqanchu, manaraqmi.
I’m glad it’s mine.	Kusikuni ñuqapa kasqanmanta.
I couldn't do without it	Manam mana chayna kasqanmantaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I just heard what he thought	Chayraqmi uyarirqani ima piensasqanmanta
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
I was here to stay.	Ñuqaqa kaypim karqani.
It certainly can be.	Cheqaqtapunin kanman.
I am afraid of things, a lot of things	Imakunatapas manchakuni, achka imakunatapas
It doesn’t do that.	Manam chaynataqa ruwanchu.
I know where this is	Yachanim maypi kay kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to do anything worse for him	Manam paypaq aswan mana allin ruwaytaqa munarqanichu
As black as possible	Atisqanman hina yana
This was not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
I’m a young man.	Ñuqaqa wayna kani.
I'm sure you know what it's like.	Seguro yachanki imayna kasqanmanta.
I’m sorry, but you’re human.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa runam kanki.
There was a day like this.	Huk punchawmi karqa kayna.
I never wanted to be like him.	Manam haykapipas pay hina kaytaqa munarqanichu.
He can do better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwanman.
It can mean everything.	Tukuy imatam niyta atinman.
Even if it is not so good.	Chayna mana allin kaptinpas.
So this is sick.	Chaymi kayqa unqusqa kachkan.
I think there is something here.	Kaypiqa imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
I loved him so much	Paytaqa anchatam munarqani
I didn’t have the time.	Manam tiempoy karqachu.
I, however, see nothing wrong with this.	Ñoqa ichaqa manan rikunichu kaypi mana allin ruwasqayta.
But we did it.	Ichaqa chayta ruwarqayku.
I am not sure how long it will take	Manam segurochu kani hayka tiempo pasananta
A good guy.	Huk allin runa.
Anywhere, doing something.	Maypipas, imatapas ruwaspa.
I knew it was late, too late	Yacharqanim tarde kasqanmanta, ancha tarde kasqanmanta
This happened three times.	Kimsa kutitam chayna pasarqa.
He didn't mean that.	Mana chaynatachu niyta munarqa.
I know where the school is	Yachanim maypi yachay wasi kasqanmanta
I’m not the one.	Manam ñuqachu kani.
I wanted to remember this	Kayta yuyariyta munarqani
There are no adults.	Manam kuraq runakunaqa kanchu.
I certainly thought about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaypi yuyaykurqani.
Really good.	Chiqap allin.
You know he couldn't do this.	Yachankim mana kayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqa.
Everything he had to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanan karqa.
I like him too you know	Ñuqapas paytaqa gustan yachanki
He is here now.	Payqa kunanmi kaypi kachkan.
I am not a rich man	Manam qhapaq runachu kani
That’s when it happened.	Chayqa hayk’aqmi karqan.
I want to know if that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam yachayta munani
I was worried about you, that’s all	Qanmanta llakisqa karqani, chaylla
I never have time to do anything	Manam haykapipas tiempoy kanchu imatapas ruwanaypaq
He gave me a song.	Takiyta quwarqa.
Something was better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi karqa mana imamantapas.
I don’t do it right	Manam allintachu ruwani
Which is great.	Imataq hatun.
Maybe, this time.	Ichapas, kay kutipi.
And there you are	Hinaspa chaypiqa kanki
Obviously I’m crazy	Sut’inmi kani loco
I wanted to see how funny it was	Chayna asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam qawayta munarqani
I didn’t think anything of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
They are intelligent people.	Paykunaqa yuyayniyuq runakunam.
I didn't want to answer.	Ñuqaqa manam kutichiyta munarqanichu.
Something out there, and it did.	Imapas hawapi, hinaspa ruwarqa.
A villain, yes.	Huk millay runa, arí.
I don’t have to pretend I’m okay here.	Manam kaypiqa allin hinachu kanay.
I almost thought you were him	Yaqapaschá pay kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I wonder if it’s okay.	Allinchu kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I was just there recently	Chayllaraqmi chaypi karqani
Today I felt as much for him as for you	Kunan punchawmi paypaq hina qampaq hina tarikurqani
Says he did, sure.	Nin chayta ruwarqan, seguro.
I knew this was going to be ugly	Yacharqanim kayqa millay kananta
I couldn't take the chance	Manam chay oportunidadta hapiyta atirqanichu
Like the real thing.	Chiqap kaq hina.
I wanted to do the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayta munarqani
I had no idea what lay ahead	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu karqani imakuna ñawpaqpi kananta
I know you can hear me.	Yachanim uyariyta atisqaykita.
Another wonderful day though	Huk sumaq punchaw ichaqa
I couldn’t do anything else	Manañam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
She could tell he wanted it.	Payqa repararqanmi chayta munasqanmanta.
That usually goes very, very wrong.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim ancha, ancha mana allintachu rin.
It wasn’t me anymore.	Manañam ñuqachu karqani.
But it is one of them.	Ichaqa hukninmi.
I don’t know what it is yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to work.	Manam llamkayta munanichu.
They are good ones.	Allinmi kanku.
No one could say that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas niyta atirqachu.
I didn’t know where he was	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqanmanta
He was very good at it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypiqa karqa.
In fact, you were better before.	Aswanpas, ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi karqanki.
Can’t do anything to fix it quickly.	Mana imatapas ruwayta atinchu usqhaylla allichayta.
He was having a very great day.	Payqa ancha hatun punchawmi kachkarqa.
It should be alone.	Sapallan kanan.
That was a year ago.	Chayqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I mean, nobody knows that.	Niyta munani, chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
And tonight it was.	Hinaspa kunan tutaqa karqan.
I most definitely do.	Ñuqaqa aswan chiqaptam ruwani.
I’m not a good person.	Manam allin runachu kani.
And he couldn’t help it.	Hinaspa mana yanapayta atirqachu.
No one can ever know.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yachayta atinmanchu.
Learn more each and every day.	Sapa punchaw hinaspa sapa punchaw astawan yachay.
I may not be ready	Manapaschá listochu kashani
No idea, but it was there.	Mana yuyayniyuq, ichaqa chaypim karqa.
They all agree.	Llapallankum acuerdopi kachkanku.
Probably not quite yet.	Yaqapaschá manaraq allintachu.
I never really heard it	Manam haykapipas allintachu uyarirqani
He says he didn't do that.	Payqa manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu nispam nin.
I mean yes, but not that	Arí niyta munani, ichaqa manan chaytachu
I didn’t want to see them.	Manam chaykunataqa qawayta munarqanichu.
I heard nothing could stop him.	Uyarirqanim mana imapas harkayta atinmanchu.
I feel rather foolish	Aswan mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikuni
We can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atichwanchu.
I plan to do that this afternoon	Chaytaqa kunan tardeta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykuni
Where was it located.	Maypitaq kasqa.
Why did he feel that way?	¿Imanasqataq chaynata tarikurqa.
I want to believe him though	Payta creeyta munani ichaqa
It won’t be any less safe.	Manan aswan pisi segurochu kanqa.
He said it wasn't right.	Payqa manam allinchu nispam nirqa.
But they were beautiful, indeed.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqanku, cheqaqtapunin.
I think that's really cool.	Chayqa chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensani.
I couldn’t say no to him	Manam paytaqa mana niyta atirqanichu
I knew he was scared	Yacharqanim mancharisqa kasqanmanta
I think he’s been sad for a long time	Yuyaykuni unayñan llakisqa kashan
I’m not going to do this right.	Manam allintachu kayta ruwasaq.
I couldn’t study there	Chaypiqa manam estudiayta atirqanichu
That means, it’s very good.	Chayqa, ancha allinmi niyta munan.
He doesn’t want to tell.	Manam willayta munanchu.
I will always be here.	Sapa kutim kaypi kasaq.
It was never bad.	Manam haykapipas mana allinchu karqa.
I don’t care what it is.	Manam imananpaschu ima kasqanmantaqa.
Everyone wants to go.	Lliwmi riyta munanku.
I knew exactly what he meant, but it didn't matter	Allintam yacharqani ima niyta munasqanmanta, ichaqa manam imananpaschu karqa
I can play here	Kaypi pukllayta atiyman
That was never really the case.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu karqan.
Do what you do man.	Ruway ruwasqaykita runa.
Now I know how foolish and wrong they are	Kunanqa yachanim imayna mana yuyayniyuq hinaspa pantasqa kasqankuta
He wants her there.	Chaypi payta munan.
I am how to be real	Ñuqaqa kani imayna chiqap kanaypaq
As frustrated and angry as anyone.	Pipas hina hukmanyasqa hinaspa phiñasqa.
That’s him.	Chayqa paymi.
I haven’t done this before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa kaytaqa ruwarqanichu
I didn’t really know what it was	Manam chiqaptachu yacharqani ima kasqanmantaqa
I wanted those things.	Chaykunataqa munarqani.
They are like other people.	Paykunaqa huk runakuna hinam kanku.
Sure there were a lot of people.	Seguro achka runakunam karqaku.
Everything looks nice.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi rikchakun.
I can't think about that	Chaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I suspect it might not be there	Sospechani manapaschá chaypichu kanman
Was he sure of it? 	¿Segurochu karqan chaymanta?
Learn more here.	Kaypi yachay.
I never thought he would come here	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayman hamunanta
She didn't need to ask him what he wanted.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu ima munasqanmanta tapuyta.
And that’s the injury.	Hinaspa chay k’irisqa.
He can’t figure it out.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atinchu.
Can you believe it?.	¿Creeyta atiwaqchu?.
I never saw that happen	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chayna pasananta
Someone else has to do it.	Chaytaqa huk runam ruwanan.
I thought he did some really good stuff	Yuyarqanim wakin chiqap allin ruwaykunata ruwasqanmanta
Quick and easy.	Utqaylla hinaspa mana sasachu.
This is the best, easiest, and most important thing.	Kayqa aswan allin, facil, importante ima.
I knew that for sure	Chaytaqa seguro hinam yacharqani
Say how you do it.	Imaynatataq ruwanki nispa niy.
What could be the problem ?.	¿Imataq chay sasachakuy kanman ?.
I didn’t want to see it all	Manam tukuy chaykunataqa qawayta munarqanichu
There was a secret there.	Chaypiqa huk pakasqa kaqmi karqa.
This was a girl.	Kayqa huk sipasmi kasqa.
I will continue to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwasaq.
I just couldn't figure it out	Chayllam mana yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I wanted to think about it.	Chaymantam yuyaymanayta munarqani.
I just couldn’t understand what was going on.	Chaylla mana entiendeyta atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta.
So that’s not going to be a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa mana allinchu kanqa.
I still haven't seen anyone	Kunankamapas manam pitapas rikurqanichu
That’s why it’s always there.	Chayraykum sapa kutilla kachkan.
I used to do that	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam ruwaq kani
I want this thing to have a name.	Kay imapas sutiyuq kananta munani.
I know it will not be easy	Yachanim chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kananta
I repeated this a few times	Chaytaqa iskay kinsa kutitan yapamanta ruwarqani

I want to sing too	Ñuqapas takiyta munani
I did not expect this	Kaytaqa manam suyarqanichu
She was such a great girl.	Payqa chayna hatun sipasmi karqa.
I didn’t want to	Manam munanichu karqa
I am truly in the world.	Cheqaqtapunin kay pachapi kashani.
I can’t eat anymore.	Manañam mikuyta atinichu.
I was sure something bad had happened.	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin pasasqanmanta.
I feel good about it.	Chaywanmi allinta sientekuni.
I wasn’t the only one who wanted to go outside	Manam ñuqallachu hawaman lluqsiyta munarqani
Everyone knows what is going to happen.	Llapallankum yachanku imakuna pasananta.
I can never catch it	Manam haykapipas hapiyta atiymanchu
He really wants a top ten though.	Payqa chiqaptam munan chunka puntata ichaqa.
I knew he would	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta
But I couldn’t do it now	Ichaqa manan kunanqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I am that simple.	Chayna facilmi kani.
I just learned that.	Chayraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani.
I know everything about the past two weeks	Tukuy imatam yachani kay iskay semana pasasqanmanta
Here's one that would be better.	Kaypi hukninmi aswan allin kanman.
We were talking.	Rimaq kayku.
I didn't see much of that	Chaymantaqa manam anchatachu rikurqani
So, it’s like this.	Chaymi, kayna.
It will take time for that.	Chaypaqqa tiempon kanqa.
I really want to tell you that.	Chayta willayta anchata munani.
It could have been more head, but that’s no big deal.	Aswan uma kanman karqan, ichaqa chayqa manan hatun ruwaychu.
I couldn’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I was nervous and scared	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima karqani
I know this stuff is hard for you	Yachanim kay imapas qampaq sasa kasqanmanta
Soon I will be very big	Pisi tiempollamantan ancha hatun kasaq
So it was very intense.	Chaymi ancha sinchi karqa.
But things went well.	Ichaqa allinmi imapas pasarqa.
Every night, if you want.	Sapa tuta, munaspaqa.
I didn’t see it anywhere	Manam maypipas rikurqanichu
I know it will help.	Yachanim yanapananta.
I have been here for two days	Iskay punchawmi kaypi kachkani
What was there in it.	Imataq chaypi karqa.
Ten good, ten bad.	Chunka allin, chunka mana allin.
If you don’t, never mind.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, ama hayk’aqpas imananpaschu.
Yes, it’s difficult.	Arí, sasam.
It looked like a house.	Wasiman rikchakurqa.
I have no idea what time it is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima hora kasqanmantaqa
I actually thought about sharing this	Chiqamanta kayta willayta yuyaykurqani
I have seen it all the time	Sapa kutim chaytaqa rikurqani
No, I can’t, I can do that.	Manam, mana atiymanchu, chaytaqa ruwayman.
I can’t tell you what he did	Manam willayta atiymanchu ima ruwasqanmanta
I don't think it is	Mana chayna kasqanmantam piensani
No, it’s not like him.	Manan, manan pay hinachu.
I know what will happen.	Yachanim imakuna pasananta.
That will be better for him.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanqa paypaq.
But you’ll have to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki kanqa.
Now I want you to be with me	Kunanqa munani ñoqawan kuska kanaykita
He was nervous tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam mancharisqa kasqa.
One who doesn’t.	Huk mana ruwaq.
I’m sure it’s very easy though.	Seguro kani ancha facil kasqanmanta ichaqa.
There was nothing I could do	Mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
Maybe something else.	Ichapas huk imapas.
I can’t wait to do it this summer!.	¡Manan suyayta atinichu kay verano ruwanaypaq!.
And here it is, man.	Hinaspa kaypi kachkan, runa.
I just didn't know how long it would take	Chayllaraqmi mana yacharqanichu hayka tiempopi kananta
It’s really easy to do.	Chiqamanta ruwayqa facilmi.
I mean, nothing.	Niyta munani, mana imapas.
He didn’t know it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu.
Okay, maybe this isn’t too hard.	Allinmi, ichapas kayqa mana ancha sasachu kanman.
I'm proud of you.	Orgulloso kani.
I can say that word now	Chay simitaqa kunanmi niyta atiyman
Could be really wrong.	Chiqamanta pantasqa kanman.
It’s not like every day.	Manam sapa punchaw hinachu.
I’ll do that for you if you want	Munaspaqa chaytan qanpaq ruwasaq
People aren’t sure about me.	Runakunaqa manan ñoqamanta segurochu kashanku.
This happened three times.	Chayqa kimsa kutitam pasarqa.
I feel better about myself	Aswan allintam sientekuni
One of the greatest ever.	Huknin aswan hatun hayk’aqpas.
So many people want to know what you know now.	Chaymi achka runakuna kunan yachasqaykita yachayta munanku.
I did it right	Allintam ruwarqani
I wouldn’t do that, you know.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu, yachanki.
I didn’t really want to study	Manam anchatachu estudiayta munarqani
I didn’t want to see him anymore	Manañam payta qawayta munarqanichu
If you really don't want to.	Sichus chiqaptapuni mana munankichu.
One month, don’t forget.	Huk killa, ama qunqaychu.
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Unayñan chayta ruwayta munani.
That really means something.	Chayqa chiqaptam imatapas niyta munan.
I’m sure he didn’t say that	Seguro kani mana chayta nisqanmanta
But it’s not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu.
I know what we have to do now	Yachanim kunan ima ruwananchik kasqanmanta
Probably not.	Yaqapaschá mana.
I have no idea what the truth is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani ima chiqap kasqanmantaqa
Such a simple thing.	Chayna facil kaq.
There is a very quick way to do this.	Chaypaqqa ancha utqayllam ruwana.
I still knew almost nothing about him, really.	Hinallam yaqa mana imatapas paymanta yacharqanichu, chiqaptapuni.
Boy, was it good.	Wayna, ¿allinchu karqan.
So this was the first one.	Chaymi kayqa ñawpaq kaq karqa.
I would love to win this	Kayta atipayta anchata munani
I didn’t know how to tell what was wrong	Manam yacharqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta imayna willayta
I wasn’t surprised, boy	Manam admirakurqanichu, wayna
I turned him down three times.	Kimsa kutitam paytaqa mana munarqanichu.
I know this is a bad time	Yachanim kayqa mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta
He knew he would never come back.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas kutimunanta.
He had some ideas.	Payqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I can't wait to drive	Manam suyayta atinichu carrota manejayta
I am not a bad person	Manam mana allin runachu kani
I never expected this	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa suyarqanichu
I feel like a kid again	Hukmanta wawa hinam tarikuni

He’s just like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinallam.
I want to know what the situation is like today	Kunan pacha imayna kasqanmantam yachayta munani
I already like him a lot	Ñam paytaqa anchata gustan
That wouldn’t be difficult.	Chayqa manan sasachu kanman.
Even if there is nothing else.	Mana imapas kaptinpas.
He certainly won’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana ruwanqachu.
I am looking forward to them.	Chaykunataqa anchatam suyachkani.
I couldn't believe it took so long	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chay achka tiempo pasasqanmanta
Certainly it could be worse.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan millay kanman.
It just means you don’t know right now.	Chaylla niyta munan kunanpacha mana yachasqaykita.
Most of the day last week.	Yaqa llapan punchawmi qayna semana.
Thus, it is certainly current.	Chay hinaqa, cheqaqtapunin kunan tiempopi kashan.
Like a day.	Huk punchaw hina.
I know you know something	Yachanim imatapas yachasqaykita
I can’t say who it is.	Manam pi kasqanmanta niyta atiymanchu.
And here it was.	Hinaspa kaypi karqan.
But he was right.	Ichaqa allintan rimarqan.
It’s been here for a very long time.	Ancha unayñam kaypi kachkan.
I plan to do this every other day.	Chaytaqa sapa iskay punchawmi ruwanaypaq yuyaykuni.
I truly feel sorry for him	Cheqaqtapunin paymanta llakikuni
I wasn’t that kind of person	Manam chayna runachu karqani
So it must be for some reason.	Chaymi imaraykupas kanan.
It doesn’t matter to anyone anymore	Manañam pimanpas imananpaschu
He looked crazy.	Payqa loco hinam rikchakurqa.
This man did most of what he wanted.	Kay runaqa yaqa llapan munasqanman hinam ruwarqa.
There is something everywhere.	Maypipas imapas kanmi.
I have no idea who that might be	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu pichus chay kanman chayta

Seriously how can that every be good.	Serio imaynataq chay sapa allin kanman.
I'm so tired of it.	Sinchi sayk'usqañan kashani.
But this is what he wanted.	Ichaqa kaytan munarqan.

I wasn’t sure he wanted to hear it	Manam segurochu karqani uyariyta munasqanmanta
I was hurt too, after all	Ñuqapas k’irisqa karqani, tukuy imamanta
I felt comfortable there.	Chaypiqa allintam tarikurqani.
No one is sure what to make of it.	Manan pipas segurochu kashan imatachus chaymanta ruwananta.
I don’t worry about it that much	Manam chaynatachu llakikuni
It didn't take very long.	Manam ancha unaytachu pasarqa.

I didn’t want to ask	Manam tapuyta munarqanichu

But someone else did.	Ichaqa huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
I honestly didn't expect it to be you	Ñuqaqa chiqaptaqa manam suyarqanichu qam kanki
I didn’t want to be anywhere else	Manam maypipas kaytaqa munarqanichu
I never saw him either	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa rikurqanichu
He is the same person.	Payqa kikin runam.
Everything was so easy, so quick.	Tukuy imapas ancha facilmi karqa, ancha utqaylla.
But now he had to do something.	Ichaqa kunanmi imatapas ruwanan karqa.
I was actually surprised at how fast he felt.	Cheqaqtapunin admirakurqani imayna usqhaylla sientekusqanmanta.
I want to do something that matters	Imapas importante kaqta ruwayta munani
I didn’t really want that	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa munarqani

After that, who knows.	Chay qhepamanmi pi yachan.

No, it’s not like saying the word.	Manan, manan simita nisqa hinachu.
Why not? 	Imanasqa mana?
It turned out really nice.	Chiqamanta sumaq lluqsirqa.
A man wants to sleep.	Huk runam puñuyta munan.
He was a very mysterious man	Payqa ancha pakasqa runam karqa
I wonder why they are here	Tapukuni imaraykutaq kaypi kachkanku
Please, you have to do it.	Ama hina kaspa, qanmi ruwanayki.
There is nothing better than this.	Kaymantaqa manam imapas aswan allinqa kanchu.
One is a lonely failure.	Hukninmi sapallan mana allin ruway.
But how about.	Ichaqa imayna.
I was happy to agree with that	Chaywanqa kusisqam tarikurqani chayta acuerdopi kanaypaq
I know he would have wanted you to	Yachanim payqa munanman karqa chayna kasqaykita
Anywhere from here.	Maypipas kaymanta.
I didn’t mean nothing by that	Manam chaywanqa mana imatapas niyta munarqanichu
I was tired and angry	Sayk’usqa, phiñasqa ima karqani
I wanted to believe them	Chaykunataqa creeyta munarqani
I want to be something	Imapas kaytam munani
I just couldn’t help it	Chaylla mana yanapayta atirqanichu
But of course you can.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwawaq.
I feel better than anything	Imamantapas aswan allinmi sientekuni
One of them must be him.	Hukninmi pay kanan.
That’s not always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
He seemed too surprised to hear her.	Payqa llumpay admirasqa hinam karqa, chaymi mana uyariyta atirqachu.
He can’t stand it.	Manam aguantayta atinmanchu.
I really hope he doesn’t	Chiqamanta suyachkani mana chayta ruwananta
It was an easy thing to do.	Chayqa huk facil ruwaymi karqa.
But it certainly could have been worse.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin aswan mana allinqa kanman karqan.
I need him, so very, very much	Payta necesitasaq, chaymi ancha, anchata
I think that's what you mean	Chaynatam nisqaykita piensani
Go anywhere, but on the tongue.	Maymanpas riy, ichaqa simipi.
I’m not a pretty person	Manam sumaq rikchayniyuq runachu kani
I can't ignore this anymore	Manañam kayta mana uyariyta atiymanchu
Things could not have gone any better.	Manam aswan allintachu imapas kanman karqa.
I can’t see it yet.	Manaraqmi rikuyta atinichu.
I have no idea what he’s going to do	Manam ima yuyayniyuqmi kani ima ruwananta
He was tired now.	Kunanqa sayk’usqañan kasqa.
I want to hear all about it tomorrow	Paqarin tukuy chaymanta uyariyta munani
I know it's stupid.	Yachanim sonso kasqanmanta.
I know it will be here	Yachanim kaypi kananta
But the future is bright.	Ichaqa hamuq tiempopiqa sumaqmi kanqa.
I knew he would be unhappy.	Yacharqanim mana kusisqa kananta.
I know this is hard.	Yachanim kayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
That lasted about three years.	Chayqa kinsa wata hinan karqan.
I’m really going to go.	Chiqaptam risaq.
I think it would be a great, great thing	Yuyaykuni hatun, hatun ruway kanman
That’s what it means.	Chaytan niyta munan.
The strong one, he is.	Sinchi kaq, payqa.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it should be.	Mana imapas allinchu, mana imapas kanan hinachu.
So that’s the big one.	Chaymi chaymi hatun.
Great man, great man	Hatun runa, hatun runa
I know you are worried	Yachanim llakisqa kasqaykita
Being an adult.	Kuraq runa kay.
I want to get out faster	Aswan utqaylla lluqsiyta munani
That was a bad thing he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa mana allinmi karqa.
I have no idea where it is	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi kasqanmantaqa
No, you can’t.	Manan, manan atiwaqchu.
I think it went well	Allintam rirqa nispaymi piensani
I was sure there was more	Seguro karqani aswan achka kasqanmanta
I hope you are.	Suyachkani chayna kasqaykita.
Everything wrong, I do everything	Tukuy ima mana allinta, tukuy imata ruwani
It’s not what he wants.	Mana munasqanman hinachu.
I need a little sleep now.	Kunanqa pisi puñuyta necesitasaq.
He will certainly be better now.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kunanqa aswan allin kanqa.
He wants something.	Imatapas munan.
The first came last year.	Ñawpaq kaqmi qayna wata hamurqan.
She could tell he was very serious.	Payqa repararqanmi ancha serio kasqanmanta.
I’m sorry, too.	Ñuqapas pampachaykuway.
It wasn’t bad, it was really good.	Manam mana allinchu karqa, chiqap allinmi karqa.
That’s what I did to him	Chaytan paytaqa ruwarqani
I am doing a lot more now	Kunanqa aswan achkatam ruwachkani
I hope you are	Suyachkani chayna kasqaykita
The best part, actually.	Aswan allin kaq, chiqaptaqa.
He couldn't come out here.	Payqa manam kayman lluqsiyta atinmanchu karqa.
He wants to, you know.	Payqa munan, yachanki.
I didn’t want to hear anything from him	Manam imatapas paymanta uyariyta munarqanichu
I always thought you were too	Sapa kutim piensarqani qampas chayna kasqaykita
I couldn’t let that go.	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu.
These are extremely useful.	Kaykunaqa sinchi allinmi.
All the way, baby.	Tukuy ñanta, wawa.
He wouldn’t want to know.	Payqa manam yachayta munanmanchu.
And a good day.	Hinaspa allin punchaw.
That would make him happier.	Chayqa aswan kusisqan kanman.
I need you tonight	Kunan tutam necesitasaq
I shouldn’t be here.	Manam kaypichu kanay.
I knew when it happened	Yacharqanim haykapi chayna kasqanmanta
Otherwise I wouldn’t do it.	Mana chayqa manan ruwaymanchu.
It’s not really a big deal.	Manam chiqaptaqa hatun ruwaychu.
I couldn't stand it.	Chaytaqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu.
I felt so silly	Chayna mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqani
I didn’t want to sit or play	Manam tiyayta nitaq pukllayta munarqanichu
I probably would have done that	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwayman karqan
I'm serious.	Serio kani.
It wouldn’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanman.
I can’t do that	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
For doing the deed.	Chay ruwayta ruwasqanmanta.
Yes, they were very happy.	Arí, paykunaqa ancha kusisqam karqaku.
I had no real idea where	Manam chiqap yuyayniyuqchu karqani maypi
It won’t do anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas ruwanqachu.
Tired of being fired.	Sayk’usqa kaymanta qarqusqa kaymanta.
He realized that no one wanted to do that	Payqa repararqanmi mana pipas chayta ruwayta munasqanmanta
But it’s probably cold.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chiri.
I knew that a long time ago	Chaytaqa unayñam yacharqani
Probably me.	Yaqapaschá ñuqa.
I didn't see him anywhere that day	Chay punchawqa manam maypipas rikurqanichu
It’s really, really hard.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sinchi.
I could have done well here	Kaypiqa allintam ruwayman karqa
After all, they were actually in it together.	Tukuy imamanta, chiqamanta kuska chaypi karqanku.
But here, there may be a strange thing.	Ichaqa kaypiqa, huk mana riqsisqa kaqmi kanman.
If you don’t, don’t do it.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, ama ruwaychu.
I was lucky that he was very drunk	Suerteyoqmi karqani ancha machasqa kasqanmanta
Not yet, but soon enough.	Manaraqmi, ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan.
I was the one who was wrong	Ñuqam pantasqa karqani
This is the bad thing.	Kaymi mana allin kaq.
I want to get a good look at that location	Chay maypi kasqanmantam allinta qawayta munani
Things might not be right.	Imapas manapaschá allinchu kanman.
He had to do this.	Kayta ruwanan karqan.
I’m sure he did.	Seguro kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He came to this place.	Payqa kayman hamurqa.
There is real action.	Chiqap ruwaymi kachkan.
I just didn’t realize how much time went by	Chayllaraqmi mana repararqanichu imayna tiempo pasasqanmanta
You certainly know something.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas yachanki.
I wasn't supposed to be there, really	Manam chaypichu kanay karqa, chiqaptaqa
And he looked at her.	Hinaspa qhawarisqa.
It could have been worse, you know.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan, yachanki.
Now that would be anything!.	Kunanqa chayqa imapas kanman!.
Once a week or once a month.	Semanapi huk kuti utaq killapi huk kuti.
Now I know what to do	Kunanqa yachanin imata ruwanayta
This sounds very sad.	Kayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi uyarikun.
I knew in advance what had happened and what would happen	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani imakuna pasasqanmanta, imakuna pasananta
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Yacharqanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta.
How that might be he didn't know, but he knew.	Imayna chay kanman chaytaqa manan yacharqanchu, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
He doesn't know what you look like yet.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqaykita.
I still won’t go.	kunankamapas manam risaqchu.
I really want a cup of coffee	Anchatam munani huk kukata
They were hurt and scared.	Paykunaqa k’irisqa, mancharisqa ima karqanku.
I really want to support that	Chaytaqa anchatam yanapayta munani
I know he said that	Yachanim chayna nisqanmanta
Everything just seemed to go together better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinta kuska puriq hinallam karqa.
You want to pay close attention to them.	Chaykunataqa allintam qawayta munanki.
The best person.	Aswan allin runa.
Here are a few.	Kaypi huk iskay kimsa.
That’s where I’m thinking about it.	Chaypin allinta yuyaykushani.
I just couldn’t figure out where or why	Chayllam mana yachayta atirqanichu maypi nitaq imanasqa kasqayta
I'm not going to go very long	Manam ancha unaytachu risaq
Yes, I do, too.	Arí, ñuqapas.
And he wanted to see her again.	Hinaspa hukmanta rikuyta munarqa.
Even if it is less.	Aswan pisi kaptinpas.
I want to make sure it’s just that	Chaylla kasqanmanta seguro kayta munani
We did everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwarqayku.
I want to be that stupid	Chayna sonso kaytam munani
I don’t know what to say	Manam yachanichu ima niyta
I thought he did a really great job.	Yuyarqanim chiqap hatun llamkayta ruwasqanmanta.
It’s really wrong, actually.	Chiqamanta pantasqa, chiqamanta.
It’s not the only thing though.	Mana chayllachu ichaqa.
Otherwise he had a bleak future.	Mana chayqa mana allin hamuq tiempon karqan.
I want to find something real	Imapas chiqap kaqta tariyta munani
This is what happened to me.	Kay hinam ñuqawanqa karqa.
I feel so sad, so unhappy	Ancha llakisqa, ancha mana kusisqa sientekuni
He realized that he knew that wouldn't happen.	Payqa repararqanmi chay mana pasananta yachasqanmanta.
He doesn't want that to happen.	Manam chayna kananpaqchu munan.
But that is useless.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​chayqa.
I mean it makes sense.	Yuyayniyuqmi niyta munani.
Everything will be fine.	Lliwmi allin kanqa.
I don’t want to know anything	Manam imatapas yachayta munanichu
I felt good, actually	Allinmi tarikurqani, chiqaptaqa
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa llumpay sumaq runam karqa.
Everything is overwhelming.	Tukuy imapas sinchi hatunmi.
I can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiymanchu.
I could not answer them	Chaykunataqa manam kutichiyta atirqanichu
Maybe it was now.	Ichapas kunan tiempo karqa.
In fact, it’s pretty big.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha hatun.
Do it every year.	Sapa wata ruway.
I can’t imagine who it could be	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu pichus kanman chayta
Is that what I ask for you	Chaytachu qampaq tapukuni
I know how hard it is for you today	Yachanim kunan punchaw qampaq imayna sinchi kasqanmanta
A lot of things are great.	Achka imapas hatunmi.
Rather, it is a routine.	Aswanpas sapa kutilla ruwaymi.
Things are not as they used to be.	Imapas manam ñawpaqpi hinachu kachkan.
So, this is a good thing.	Chaymi, kayqa allinmi.
I’m not going to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwasaqchu.
I probably didn’t do that	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
I tried to block it all out, no more	Tukuy chayta hark’ayta munarqani, manaña
Learn more here .	Astawan kaypi yachay .
I used to be a happy person.	Ñawpaqtaqa kusisqa runam karqani.
Never heard of this before.	Mana hayk’aqpas kaymanta uyarirqanichu.
You can’t do that	Chaytaqa manam atiwaqchu
I know you know better than that.	Yachanim chaymanta aswan allinta yachasqaykita.
Angry at me.	Ñoqamanta phiñasqa.
I couldn’t do this	Manam kaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
Right now that’s you.	Kunanpacha chayqa qanmi kanki.
I didn't think it was really pretty	Manam piensarqanichu chiqap sumaq rikchayniyuq kananpaq
I was the only one who knew it was coming	Ñuqallam yacharqani chay hamunanta
You don’t really know anything yet.	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa imatapas yachankichu.
I knew it would be good one day	Yacharqanim huk punchaw allin kananpaq
I mean, it’s really good	Niyta munani, chiqap allinmi
I don’t know where it is	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmanta
I knew things were worth it	Yacharqanim imapas allinpaq kasqanmanta
I’m not happy though.	Manam kusisqachu kani ichaqa.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Chaywanqa manam ima ruwaytapas munarqanichu.
He’s been gone for a long time.	Unayñan manaña kanchu.
I want to know more	Astawan yachayta munani
That says something, actually.	Chayqa imatapas nin, chiqaptaqa.
I spent most of the night there in the hospital	Chaypim yaqa llapan tuta hospitalpi karqani
But today there is a constant.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa kanmi huk sapa kutilla.
Repeat after me.	Ñoqa qhepaman yapamanta ruway.
I had an idea last night	Qayna tutam huk yuyayniyuq karqani
She is very afraid of not being with me.	Payqa ancha manchakunmi mana ñoqawan kasqanmanta.
And then he knew.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yacharqa.
I need an answer on what's wrong with that	Chaypi ima mana allin kasqanmanta kutichiyta necesitasaq
That's really what it's all about.	Chayqa chiqaptam tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
I never knew why.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
But he doesn't do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwanchu.
Who knows what will happen.	Pi yachan imakuna pasananta.
But it’s not as bad as it gets.	Ichaqa manan millay hinachu.
I am very happy indeed	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chiqaptapuni
There is a man there.	Chaypim huk runa kachkan.
Slightly uncomfortably, perhaps .	Pisi mana allintachu, ichapas .
It looks good now.	Kunanqa allinmi rikchakun.
I wouldn’t want to talk to him.	Manam paywan rimayta munanmanchu.
You said you wished it was gone.	Qanmi nirqanki manaña kananta munasqaykita.
I wouldn't be here long	Manam unaytachu kaypi kayman karqa
I still don’t know.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu.
He could not cope without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam aguantayta atirqachu.
The truth is, he didn’t really know.	Cheqaq kaqmi, payqa manan allintachu yacharqan.
That’s not this.	Chay mana kay.
You know you can do it.	Yachankim chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
So here they are.	Chaymi kaypi kachkanku.
I didn't think it would be a problem	Manam piensarqanichu sasachakuy kananta
He couldn't hold it.	Mana hapiyta atirqachu.
There’s everything there.	Chaypin tukuy imapas kan.
I could be a teacher	Yachachiq kayta atiyman
That would have been really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanman karqa.
I didn’t expect that to be really good	Manam suyarqanichu chay chiqap allin kananta
That wasn’t always the case	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina karqan
I didn’t hear it anymore.	Manaña uyarirqanichu.
I’m sure that means nothing	Seguro kani chaywanqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu
What you know, you know.	Imatachus yachanki, yachanki.
I’d love to know your thoughts	Anchatan munani yuyaykusqaykita yachayta
There’s that.	Chaypi chaymanta.
They were all excellent.	Llapallankum ancha allin karqa.
Two to go.	Iskay rinanpaq.
But, unfortunately, this is not the case.	Ichaqa, llakikuypaqmi, manan chay hinachu.
I didn't think it would happen	Manam piensarqanichu chayna pasananta
I know that doesn't make much sense	Yachanim chay mana ancha yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I know he doesn't feel that way	Yachanim mana chaynatachu sientekusqanmanta
This is a good thing for you to do.	Kayqa allinmi qampaq ruwanaykipaq.
I get that, but he wanted to be bigger than you	Chaytan hap’ini, ichaqa payqa munarqanmi qanmanta aswan hatun kayta
I don't know how to fix the problem.	Manam yachanichu chay sasachakuy allichayta.
I know why he did it.	Yachanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That's pretty quick, but it really looks like it.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam, ichaqa chiqaptam chayman rikchakun.
Now, he knew why.	Kunanqa, payqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
I would do the same!	¡Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayman!
I knew how badly he wanted to be taken for granted	Yacharqanim imayna mana allinpaq hapisqa kayta munasqanmanta
What’s going to happen? 	¿Imataq kanqa?
He really likes it, actually	Paytaqa anchatam gustan, chiqaptaqa
I need some help.	Wakin yanapayta necesitasaq.
Maybe you’re on to something.	Ichapas imapipas kachkanki.
He didn’t want to see her again.	Manas hukmanta rikuyta munarqanchu.
It looks like it could be.	Chayqa kanman hinam rikchakun.
I’m so angry and upset.	Ancha phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kani.
I didn't know what to do	Manañam ima ruwanayta yacharqanichu
I tend to find that as the next challenge.	Ñuqaqa chayta tariyta munani qatiqnin sasachakuy hina.
That’s obviously up to him.	Chayqa sut’inmi paymanta kanqa.
He knows they are there.	Payqa yachanmi chaypi kasqankuta.
She didn’t know who he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pi kasqanmanta.
I didn’t really know who he was	Manam allintachu yacharqani pi kasqanmantaqa
He wants her to be successful.	Payqa munanmi allin kananpaq.
And that’s all.	Hinaspa chaylla.
He came on a bicycle.	Payqa bicicletapi hamurqa.
This is it, you think.	Kaymi, nispan yuyaykunki.
I am just as tired now as you are	Ñoqapas kunanqa qan hinan ancha sayk'usqa kashani
I want him to come back	Munani kutimunanta
He can’t leave anything behind	Manam imatapas saqiyta atinmanchu
Maybe you did, but maybe not.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqanki, ichaqa manapaschá.
I wanted to ask you something.	Imatapas tapuyta munarqani.
Now, tell me about him.	Kunanqa, paymanta willaway.
He can’t stop it.	Mana harkayta atinchu.
Such a beautiful child.	Chayna sumaq wawa.
You figure out another way.	Huk ñanta yuyaykunki.
I mean really sad	Chiqamanta llakisqa niyta munani
I don’t know how to get there.	Manam yachanichu chayman chayayta.
Now it’s faster.	Kunanqa aswan utqaylla.
He knows where you are.	Maypi kasqaykita yachan.
I could never stay mad at anyone for long	Manam haykapipas piwanpas unayta phiñasqa kayta atirqanichu
And so, you may not want to see this stuff.	Hinaspa chayna, manapaschá kay imakunatapas qawayta munankichu.
The night was fine.	Tutaqa allinmi karqa.
I didn’t really know why	Manam chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I was ready to do anything	Ñoqaqa tukuy imatapas ruwanaypaqmi listo karqani
I’m a scared person.	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa runam kani.
I think that’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan, nispan yuyaykuni.
I thought he was happy	Kusisqa kasqanmantam piensarqani
I felt happy and happy about something	Imamantapas kusisqam kusisqam tarikurqani
I couldn’t understand why	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I’m afraid it won’t be enough	Manchakuni mana chayllachu kananta
I need a good night’s sleep	Allin tuta puñuyta necesitasaq
He wanted to ask her why.	Payqa imarayku chayta tapuyta munarqa.
So, it’s not a good thing.	Chaymi, mana allinchu.
He did everything wrong.	Payqa tukuy imatam mana allinta ruwarqa.
Okay, it makes a lot of sense.	Allinmi, achka yuyayniyuq.
I really mean listening.	Chiqamanta uyariyta niyta munani.
I knew it was better than that	Yacharqanim chaymanta aswan allin kasqanmanta
You don’t know what you’re going to do next.	Manan yachankichu imatachus qhepaman ruwanaykita.
I don’t remember what happened next	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan yuyarinichu
I can’t leave you here	Manam kaypi saqiyta atiymanchu
They were, of course, proud of it.	Paykunaqa, cheqaqtapunin chaymanta orgulloso karqanku.
I'm not sure how you can do that.	Manam segurochu kani imaynatam chayta ruwawaq.
I stopped listening too, to be honest.	Ñoqapas manañan uyarirqanichu, cheqaqta rimanaypaq.
Anywhere in practice.	Maypipas ruwaypi.
You know, he, but it’s better.	Yachanki, pay, ichaqa aswan allinmi.
This was last week.	Kayqa qayna semanan karqan.
I didn’t expect what happened next	Chay qhepaman imachus kananta manan suyarqanichu
I don't know what to do	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq
This is the next step.	Kaymi qatiqnin ruwayqa.
He won't do it now.	Kunanqa manañam ruwanqachu.
I almost wished he hadn’t	Yaqapaschá mana chayta ruwananta munarqani
Don’t do these things.	Ama chaykunataqa ruwaychu.
I had to do that first	Ñawpaqtaqa chaytam ruwanay karqa
I don’t like it anywhere	Manam maypipas gustanchu
And, now that we’ve done that difficult thing.	Hinaspa, kunan chay sasa ruwayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I know how to swim	Nadayta yachani
I think he is right.	Yuyaykuni, payqa allintam rimachkan.
We cannot ignore them.	Chaykunataqa manam mana uyariyta atichwanchu.
It wasn’t like it is today.	Manam kunan tiempopi hinachu karqa.
It would have been nice	Sumaqmi kanman karqa
However, such an approach is uncertain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu chay hina ruwayqa.
It's like a world out here, anyway.	Kay hawapi huk pacha hinam, imayna kaptinpas.
I had never heard of it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu
I’m really not there yet.	Chiqamanta manaraq chaypichu kachkani.
I have been there, twice	Chaypim karqani, iskay kutita
Once a week.	Semanapi huk kuti.
They were neither good nor bad.	Paykunaqa manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu karqanku.
This is not taken seriously.	Kayqa manam allintachu hapisqa.
But we had to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanayku karqan.
I have no idea where, or if, they are	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi, utaq sichus, kasqankuta
I want to eat	Mikhuyta munani
I have no idea if that is the case or not.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani chayna kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta.
Or two of them.	Utaq iskay.
I don’t want to play there.	Chaypi pukllayta mana munanichu.
I still worry about it.	Kunankamapas chaymantam llakikuni.
Happy for you, surprised though	Kusisqam qampaq, admirasqa ichaqa
But that is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa.
You look so amazing.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakunki.
I wanted to do things right	Allintam imatapas ruwayta munarqani
I can't believe it's you	Manam creeyta atinichu qam kasqaykita
Everything was outside.	Tukuy imapas hawapi kasqa.
It was me and not me.	Ñuqam karqani manam ñuqachu.
But he's still not sure it's right.	Ichaqa hinallam mana segurochu kachkan allin kasqanmanta.
I immediately knew what it was	Chayllam yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
I don’t remember what it was.	Manam yuyarinichu ima kasqanmanta.
I almost got hurt.	Yaqapaschá k’irisqa karqani.
Now he was alone.	Kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
I’m a good guy.	Allin runam kani.

So there is.	Chaymi kan.
I knew what was coming next	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna hamunanta
I am very sorry, but that is what needs to be done now.	Anchatam llakikuni, ichaqa chaytam kunan ruwana.
That was about half of what he needed.	Chayqa karqa yaqa kuskan necesitasqanmanta.
This is really hard to do.	Kayqa chiqaptam sasa ruwayqa.
If there is a time.	Sichus kan huk kuti.
I didn’t think I was sure who it was	Manam yuyaykurqanichu pi kasqanmanta seguro kanaypaq
So there you are.	Chaymi chaypi kanki.
Maybe, one day.	Ichapas, huk punchaw.
But this is a real chance for you.	Ichaqa kayqa chiqap chansa qampaq.
Three, three.	Kimsa, kimsa.
I want you to be better.	Munani aswan allin kanaykita.
He is now a man.	Payqa kunanmi runa.
I can’t do this anymore.	Manañam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I mean almost nowhere	Yaqa mana maypipas niyta munani
Do this regularly throughout the day.	Chaytaqa tukuy punchaw sapa kuti ruway.
It was very stupid of me.	Ancha sonso kaymi karqa ñuqamanta.
He told me so, more than once.	Chaynatam niwarqa, aswan achka kutita.
I always said it was	Sapa kutim nirqani chayna kasqanmanta
This was a good idea.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Know that it needs work.	Yachay llamkayta necesitasqanmanta.
I know that makes no sense	Yachanim chayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu
That’s really nice of me.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqamanta.
I am anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas kani.
A real person.	Huk chiqap runa.
A month, maybe longer	Huk killa, ichapas aswan unayta
There are three types.	Kimsa laya kan.
What to do with it.	Imatataq chaywan ruwana.
I went to a school there	Chaypim huk escuelaman rirqani
He is a very interesting person.	Payqa ancha sumaq yuyayniyuq runam.
But there was never anything there.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypiqa imapas karqanchu.
I don’t know what they are	Manam yachanichu imakuna kasqankuta
That’s neither here nor there at the moment.	Chayqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kunan tiempopi.
I mean, he says very sadly	Niyta munani, ancha llakisqa nin
I did a lot of wrong things	Achka mana allintam ruwarqani
But I still wasn’t quite sure what to do	Ichaqa manaraqmi allintachu yacharqani imata ruwanaypaq
But this is who I am.	Ichaqa kaymi ñoqaqa kani.
I didn’t know what to say about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta ima niyta
Soon he was there.	Pisi tiempollamantan chaypi kasharqan.
I feel better about what happened	Chay pasasqanmantaqa aswan allinmi tarikuni
I can't believe how much he did in that house.	Manam creeyta atinichu chay wasipi hayka ruwasqanmanta.
He is a happy man.	Payqa kusisqa runam.
He did it a long time ago.	Payqa unayñan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I was such a fool	Ñuqaqa chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi karqani
They used to be like that.	Ñawpaqtaqa chhayna karqanku.
It was after that.	Chay qhepamanmi karqan.
You can’t understand it.	Qamqa manam entiendeyta atiwaqchu.
It was never really me.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa ñuqachu karqani.
He really did a great job	Payqa cheqaqtapunin hatun llank’ayta ruwarqan
So maybe that was it.	Chaymi ichapas chayna karqa.
I want to know what other awesome things he’s done	Yachayta munani ima huk manchay ruwaykunata ruwasqanmanta
But I was too good at this	Ichaqa kaypiqa llumpay allinmi karqani
That was me, too.	Chayqa ñuqam karqani.
It was getting bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kachkarqa.
I really have no idea why it does this	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku kayta ruwan
Bigger than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan hatun.
I was never sure I was doing it	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani ruwasqaymanta
I know what's wrong	Yachanim ima mana allin kasqanmanta
It wasn’t easy being with me	Manam facilchu karqa ñuqawan kayqa
Maybe an hour.	Ichapas huk hora.
I don't need it tonight	Kunan tutaqa manam necesitasaqchu
I just feel so so tired	Chaylla ancha ancha sayk’usqa sientekuni
That’s what I do.	Chaytan ruwani.
This one goes really fast.	Kayqa chiqap utqayllam rin.
A different approach may not.	Huk hina ruwayqa manapaschá.
I'm always waiting	Sapa kutim suyachkani
This isn’t the first time.	Kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu.
I don’t want to have to do it again.	Manam munanichu hukmanta ruwanay kasqanmanta.
I mean, he was great	Niyta munani, payqa hatunmi karqa
I would have done that	Chaynatam ruwayman karqa
I still refused to believe it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta munarqanichu
Yes, it was so good that it was unreal.	Arí, ancha allinmi karqan, chaymi mana cheqaqchu karqan.
I'm busy right now anyway.	Kunanqa imayna kaptinpas ocupasqa kachkani.
I feel almost sane now	Kunanqa yaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi tarikuni
I want to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayta munani.
He didn’t want anything.	Payqa manan imatapas munarqanchu.
I don't understand what to do.	Manam entiendenichu imata ruwanaypaq.
I didn’t really want to know.	Mana chiqaptachu yachayta munarqani.
Actually two things.	Chiqaptaqa iskay imakuna.
I have a lot to do today.	Kunan punchawmi achka ruwanay kachkan.
Don’t want that.	Ama chayta munankichu.
I said that’s good enough for me.	Chayqa allinmi ñuqapaq nispaymi nirqani.
I'm a little worried about that.	Chaymantam huk chikan llakisqa kachkani.
Obviously he was really great.	Sut’inmi payqa cheqaqtapuni hatun karqan.
I think about that at least	Chaypiqa yaqapaschá piensani
He knows the truth.	Payqa yachanmi cheqaq kaqta.
It wasn’t that good anymore.	Manañam chayna allinchu karqa.
Repeat if desired.	Munaspaqa yapamanta ruway.
I was with him that day.	Chay punchawmi paywan karqani.
But that will be the case in the future.	Ichaqa chay hinan hamuq tiempopi kanqa.
I can't believe he's sad	Mana creeyta atinichu llakisqa kasqanmanta
But you won’t always succeed.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwanki.
I know a lot more.	Aswan achkatam yachani.
It can never really be man	Mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu kanman runa
I had not heard of these before	Chaykunataqa manam ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanichu
To help him out.	Payta yanapananpaq.
But I didn’t know what to do	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I hope it will be there	Suyachkani chaypi kananta
I can’t do it for you	Manam qampaq ruwayta atiymanchu
I know something is wrong with him	Yachanim imapas mana allin paywan kasqanmanta
You don’t know where you are.	Manam yachankichu maypi kasqaykita.
I know he wants the best for me	Yachanim allin kaqta ñuqapaq munasqanmanta
I can't stop watching	Manam qawayta saqiyta atiymanchu
I'm sure he is	Seguro kani pay kasqanmanta
That's too soon to say for sure.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam seguro niyta.
I think he wanted to do the right thing	Yuyaykuni allin kaqta ruwayta munasqanmanta
I was scared, scared, and furious	Mancharisqa, mancharisqa, sinchi phiñasqa ima karqani
I wanted to be like that.	Chayna kaytam munarqani.
He certainly could have done better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allinta ruwayta atinman karqan.
This is a good thing	Kayqa allinmi
I didn’t want to play	Manam pukllayta munarqanichu
I immediately knew what was going on	Chayllam yacharqani imakuna pasasqanmanta
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna pasananta
It doesn't matter anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam imananpaschu.
I agree that that is important	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam acuerdopi kani
You may be seriously injured.	Ichapas sinchita k'irisqa kanki.
I never really thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa piensarqanichu chayna kananta
This was not what it was supposed to be.	Kayqa manam kanan hinachu karqa.
I didn’t want to say anything about it	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta munarqanichu
So far it has been great.	Kunankamaqa hatunmi karqa.
He is always here.	Payqa sapa kutim kaypi kachkan.
I listened really well	Cheqaqtapunin allinta uyarirqani
I know you can do anything	Yachanim imatapas ruwayta atisqaykita
You didn’t quite know yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yacharqanki.
I want some time alone with you	Munani huk chikan tiempota sapallay qanwan
I was sick that day	Chay punchawmi unqusqa karqani
I'm sure it will	Seguro kani chayna kananta
I’ll be fine without it	Mana chaywanqa allinmi kasaq
This happened recently.	Kaymi pasarqa chayllaraq.
Tired of that.	Sayk’usqa chaymanta.
Not good, but better.	Mana allinchu, aswanpas aswan allinmi.
The last one is the most important.	Qhepa kaqmi aswan importante.
I had to do something human	Runa hina kaqta ruwanay karqan
The one that wasn’t injured.	Mana k’irisqa kaq.
I didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Manañan paywan rimayta munarqanichu
But he told me, no.	Ichaqa niwarqanmi, manan.
He can’t stop her from doing it, I don’t know why.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atinchu chayta ruwananpaq, manan yachanichu imarayku.
He looked very serious.	Payqa ancha serio hinam rikchakurqa.
One of them, at least.	Hukninmi, aswanpas.
He made the walk.	Payqa puriyta ruwarqa.
I did it three times last week.	Qayna semanan kinsa kutita ruwarqani.
But I couldn’t say that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa niyta atirqanichu
But who could that person be?.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq chay runa kanman?.
I think it’s very important that you do it for him	Yuyaykuni ancha importante kaqta paypaq ruwasqaykita
They are human beings.	Paykunaqa runam kanku.
I wasn't ready and he knew that	Manam listochu karqani chaytam payqa yacharqa
It’s just not here.	Chaylla mana kaypichu.
Maybe there’s something for you	Ichapas qampaq imapas kanman
And then they learn.	Hinaspa chaymanta yachanku.
I was put on all the time	Tukuy tiempon churasqa karqani
This was a few years ago.	Kayqa karqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I was pretty proud of what we did there	Allin orgulloso karqani chaypi ruwasqaykumanta
That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
This is probably the best.	Kayqa yaqapaschá aswan allinqa.
Almost like a stranger, a stranger.	Yaqa mana riqsisqa, mana riqsisqa runa hina.
I was there early as usual	Sapa kuti hinam chaypi temprano karqani
This was very bad.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
I wonder who that person is	Tapukuni pitaq chay runa kasqanmanta
First, I’ll make some coffee right away.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaylla kukata ruwasaq.
They are great people	Paykunaqa hatun runakunam
I think there is some truth to this.	Kaypiqa wakin chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
He is doing very well though.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan ichaqa.
I was crazy about it	Ñuqaqa chaymanta loco karqani
I was a black man.	Yana runam karqani.
I certainly learned things	Cheqaqtapunin imakunatapas yacharqani
I didn't think you were drunk	Manam piensarqanichu machasqa kasqaykita
It’s just not there anymore.	Chaylla manaña chaypichu kachkan.
But this will not be so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kayqa kanqa.
I know it very well.	Ancha allintam yachani.
Something is very wrong.	Imapas ancha mana allinmi kachkan.
I did that yesterday and the day before	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi hinaspa ñawpaq punchawmi ruwarqani
Not like me, though.	Mana ñuqa hinachu.
But he’ll be there again tonight.	Ichaqa kunan tutan yapamanta chaypi kanqa.
I can’t focus on that	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I really wasn’t sure	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqani
I didn’t want that	Chaytaqa manan munarqanichu
Here’s what I need to do	Kaypiqa imakuna ruwanay tiyan
I didn't know what time of day it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima hora punchaw kasqanmantaqa
Maybe twenty people.	Ichapas iskay chunka runakuna.
And three of them.	Hinaspa kimsa.
I heard it was really good but hard.	Uyarirqanim chiqap allin kasqanmanta ichaqa sasa kasqanmanta.
I really want to be just that.	Anchatan munani chaylla kayta.
I can’t do everything for you	Manan tukuy imatapas qanpaq ruwaymanchu
I thought that was the case	Chayqa chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
But again, he’s right, and that’s a problem.	Ichaqa yapamanta, payqa allintan nin, chaymi huk sasachakuy.
I’m from him.	Ñuqa paymanta.
He will be a great success.	Payqa hatun allin ruwaymi kanqa.
I want to work together	Kuska llamkayta munani
I can't remember them.	Chaykunataqa manam yuyariyta atinichu.
I don’t want to be here	Manam kaypi kayta munanichu
Tell me now.	Kunan willaway.
Maybe a little too soon.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha utqaylla.
I feel lonely and sad	Sapallan llakisqa tarikuni
No, that wasn’t all that mattered.	Manan, manan chayllachu importante karqan.
I’m asking this.	Kayta tapukuni.
If it does, that’s fine.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa, allinmi.
It really is that bad.	Chiqaptam chayna mana allinqa.
He doesn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I still know where you live	Kunankamapas yachanim maypi yachasqaykita
I can't wait to buy it again	Manam suyayta atinichu hukmanta rantiyta
I didn't think anything would be that bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas chayna mana allin kananpaq
He was too good at this.	Payqa llumpay allinmi karqa kaypi.
I have not seen beauty until now	Kunankamaqa manam sumaq kaytaqa rikurqanichu
You will have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintan ruwanayki kanqa.
I didn’t know he was here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta.
He said he hoped to come.	Hamuyta suyakusqanmanta nirqa.
I know you would do just about anything for him	Yachanim paypaq yaqa tukuy imatapas ruwanaykita
I wonder what it is	Tapukuni imataq kasqanmanta
This left him unable to speak.	Chaywanmi manaña rimayta atirqachu.
It’s night.	Tutan kashan.
Still, it would be nice to talk more.	Chayna kaptinpas, sumaqmi kanman astawan rimayqa.
I saw him there this morning	Kunan paqarinmi chaypi rikurqani
Most people are like me.	Yaqa llapan runakunam ñuqa hina kanku.
I had to make sure it was perfect	Mana pantasqa kananpaqmi seguro kanay karqa
He was the best.	Payqa aswan allinmi karqan.
I don’t think about it	Manam chaypiqa piensanichu
You never knew it.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yacharqankichu.
I just hope no one comes	Chaylla suyachkani mana pipas hamunanta
I didn’t think anyone would get hurt	Manam yuyaykurqanichu pipas k’irisqa kananta
There is no reason.	Imaraykupas mana kanchu.
I knew what it could be	Yacharqanim ima kanman chayta
I have to ask a big question	Hatun tapuyta ruwanay tiyan
So he said that could be the problem.	Chaymi chay sasachakuy kanman nispam nirqa.
I wanted to know what was out there	Chay hawapi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
I was very surprised and disappointed	Ancha admirasqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa tarikurqani
I knew where he lived	Yacharqanim maypi yachasqanmanta
He didn’t want to be part of it.	Payqa manan chay ruwaypi kayta munarqanchu.
That doesn't matter, though.	Chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​ichaqa.
As great as he was, he never succeeded.	Hatun kaptinpas, manam haykapipas atirqachu.
He was there every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi chaypi karqa.
To know that he can do something.	Imatapas ruwayta atisqanmanta yachananpaq.
No one can imagine that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atinmanchu.
I’m not going to go	Manam risaqchu kani
I didn’t know there were so many	Manam yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta
I almost can’t believe it	Yaqa mana creeyta atinichu
I hope things work out for you	Suyachkani imapas allin kananpaq qampaq
He was the best ever.	Payqa aswan allinqa karqan.
I didn’t know that	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu
I am very happy with how it turned out	Ancha kusisqam tarikuni imayna kasqanmanta
Now I really want to know	Kunanqa anchatam yachayta munani
I won’t do that to him again	Manañan chaytaqa paytaqa ruwasaqchu
He was all over the place.	Payqa lliwmi kasqa.
I knew it was the only thing	Yacharqanim chaylla kasqanmanta
I hear about it every day	Sapa punchawmi chaymanta uyarini
He knows he is in dire straits.	Payqa yachanmi sinchi sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
I have no idea, man, he says	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani, runa, nispas nin
I know you can't see it	Yachanim mana rikuyta atisqaykita
I wasn’t really a gamer	Manam chiqaptachu pukllaq runa karqani
Three times today, wrong again.	Kunan punchaw kimsa kutita, yapamanta pantasqa.
I didn’t think it was good enough.	Manam allin kananpaqchu piensarqani.
He wasn’t a nobody.	Payqa manam pipas karqachu.
It was early but sure.	Chayqa temprano karqan ichaqa seguro.
I barely did anything	Yaqapaschá mana imatapas ruwarqanichu
Yes, it's been a long time.	Arí, ancha unayñam.
But why should it be so?	Ichaqa, ¿imaraykutaq chayna kanan.
There he did it again.	Chaypin hukmanta ruwarqan.
There is no house now.	Wasi kunan mana kanchu.
I had to do the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwanay karqa
However, that was no longer the case.	Ichaqa, chayqa manañan karqanchu.
I never thought of those things.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa piensarqanichu.
This is impossible to do.	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atichwanchu.
The man was actually there.	Chay runaqa cheqaqtapunin chaypiqa karqan.
He can’t tell.	Mana willayta atinchu.
No, boy, that’s not right.	Manan, wayna, chayqa manan allinchu.
He didn't know how to do it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna ruwananta.
I am the last of him	Paymanta qhepa kaqmi kani
and.	chaymanta.
I wanted to talk to you first.	Ñawpaqtaqa qanwan rimayta munarqani.
But I never heard of him	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu
I wanted to be smart	Yachaysapa kaytam munarqani
I wanted to do it all again and again	Tukuy chayta yapamanta yapamanta ruwayta munarqani
It didn’t seem right.	Mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
There is nothing one can do	Huk runaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu
This fast, in this car.	Kay utqaylla, kay carropi.
He talks, he talks, he talks.	Riman riman riman.
I can't tell what type it is	Manam ima laya kasqanmantaqa yachayta atinichu
But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqan.
I did that for two and a half years.	Chaytaqa iskay wata kuskan ruwarqani.
I said the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam nirqani
There is nothing I can do about this	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
How does that sound?.	¿Imaynataq chay uyarikun?.
But he quickly tried to do it again.	Ichaqa usqhayllan chayta yapamanta ruwayta munarqan.
Almost this.	Yaqa kay.
The result was just like him.	Chay ruwasqanqa pay hinam karqa.
I couldn’t talk about anything	Manam imamantapas rimayta atirqanichu
I think you’re right	Allinmi kasqaykita yuyaykuni
He keeps talking about it.	Chaymantaqa hinallam rimachkan.
A year of uncertainty can’t be easy	Huk wata mana seguro kayqa manan facilchu kanman
I am still excited about it	Kunankamapas chaymantam kusisqa kachkani
Saying things, maybe.	Imakunatapas nispa, ichapas.
I didn’t know anything about it really	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanichu chiqaptaqa
I will do everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwasaq.
I didn’t know you were there	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqaykita
I'm good at this actually	Ñuqaqa kaypi allintam kani chiqaptaqa
I was a sick person, really sick	Unqusqa runam karqani, chiqap unqusqa
I had no time to do anything.	Manam tiempoy karqachu imatapas ruwanaypaq.
I can't stand it now	Kunanqa manañam aguantayta atiymanchu
It doesn’t make much sense.	Mana ancha yuyayniyuqchu.
I won't be here much longer	Manañam aswan unaytachu kaypi kasaq
I won’t have anywhere else to go	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq kanqachu
I can’t do that now	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa ruwaymanchu
It doesn’t seem right.	Mana allinchu rikchakun.
Yes, that is a very good thing.	Arí, chayqa ancha allinmi.
I had no one to talk to	Manam piwanpas rimanaypaq karqachu
It may not make sense.	Manapaschá imapaqpas valenchu.
I was the only one who got caught	Ñuqallam hapisqa karqani
I mean, they’re famous.	Chayta niyta munani, paykunaqa riqsisqa kanku.
Not you and me.	Mana qamwan ñuqawan.
And it’s very large.	Hinaspa ancha hatun.
No, not really, but it probably was	Manam, manam chiqaptachu, ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa
He didn't need this now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kayta necesitarqanchu.
I really didn't want to have this conversation with him	Chiqaptaqa manam munarqanichu paywan kay rimayta
Take a ride with me.	Ñoqawan kuska huk carropi riy.
Almost everything else.	Yaqa tukuy imamanta.
Now I want to get this	Kunanqa kayta hap’iyta munani
Hopefully it never comes back	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas kutimunanta
It is doing the latter.	Kay qhipa kaqta ruwachkan.
I am still sure of that.	Kunankamapas chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
Wherever that is.	Maypipas chayna kaptinpas.
I can't believe how fast the time has gone	Manam creeyta atinichu chay tiempo chaylla pasasqanmanta
He was banished to the city.	Payta llaqtaman qarqusqa.
They were there last night.	Qayna tutam chaypi karqaku.
He is a difficult man.	Payqa sasa runam.
Which was mine.	Imataq ñuqapa karqa.
Who was it that was.	Pitaq chayna karqa.
You are a real people person.	Chiqap runakuna runam kanki.
I have no idea what’s wrong	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna mana allin kasqanmanta
I am trying very hard.	Anchatam kallpanchakuchkani.
I was almost surprised	Yaqapaschá admirakurqani
He was seriously outnumbered.	Payqa sinchitan aswan askha karqan.
This is not good, that is not good.	Kayqa manam allinchu, chayqa manam allinchu.
He was already in trouble.	Payqa ñam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
There is nothing I can do here	Kaypiqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I said that’s a good thing	Chayqa allinmi nispaymi nirqani
I’m really in trouble	Cheqaqtapunin sasachakuypi kashani
I think they are gone now	Kunanqa manaña kasqankuta yuyani
I didn’t know what was going to happen.	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna pasananta.
I thought that was interesting	Chayqa sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
Be mindful of it.	Chaypi yuyayniyuq kay.
I said that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi nirqani.
But tell me something first.	Ichaqa ñawpaqta imatapas willaway.
I actually haven't seen that	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa rikurqanichu
I can talk about that now.	Chaymantaqa kunanmi rimayta atiyman.
I couldn’t think fast enough.	Manam utqaylla yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
It’s probably not a good thing.	Yaqapaschá mana allinchu.
I didn’t see it happen	Manam rikurqanichu chay pasananta
I mean, he's not here anymore	Niyta munani, manañam kaypichu kachkan
I mean, I'm not sure.	Niyta munani, nispa.
He never thought twice about it.	Mana hayk’aqpas iskay kutita yuyaykurqanchu.
But I thought about it every day	Ichaqa sapa p’unchaymi chaypi yuyaykurqani
He was the one who was.	Paymi karqan chay kaq.
Now I don’t feel good about this	Kunanqa manan allintachu sientekuni kaymanta
I didn’t want tonight to be a bad one	Manam munarqanichu kunan tuta mana allin kananpaq
I can't believe you're here.	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqaykita.
So things were wrong, really wrong.	Chaymi imapas mana allin karqa, chiqap mana allin.
I can't think about this.	Kaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I didn’t really know what else happened	Manam allintachu yacharqani imakuna huk pasasqanmanta
I wanted to see everything	Tukuy imatam qawayta munarqani
He would have done that now.	Kunanqa chayta ruwanman karqan.
I really want to help	Chiqaptam yanapayta munani
Like himself.	Imayna pay kikin.
I just feel that way	Chayllaraqmi chayna sientekuni
I can't believe no one wants to buy this	Manam creeyta atinichu mana pipas kayta rantiyta munasqanmanta
If you know more, let me know.	Astawan yachanki chayqa, willaway.
I wouldn't do it anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam ruwaymanchu
I can't take it that way.	Manam chaynatachu hapiyta atiyman.
I hope there will be new people there	Suyachkani chaypi musuq runakuna kananta
I was brighter in the future	Hamuq tiempopiqa aswan sumaqmi karqani
I have time to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi tiempoy kan
I don’t remember his name.	Manam yuyarinichu sutinta.
I had been alone for a long time before that	Chay ñawpaqtaqa unayñan sapallay karqani
He did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqa.
I couldn't figure out why he would want to see it.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu imanasqa qawayta munanman karqa chayta.
I’ve done these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwarqani.
I still can't believe he's actually here	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu chiqaptapuni kaypi kasqanmanta
I didn’t know who you were	Manam yacharqanichu pi kasqaykita
I know you want more	Yachanim astawan munasqaykita
I want to work there	Chaypi llamk’ayta munani
It’s been a tough week.	Sinchi semanan karqan.
Did that this time, not good.	Chayta ruwarqa kay kutipi, mana allinchu.
I’ll be with him this one time.	Kay huk kutilla paywan kasaq.
Not only that, but.	Mana chayllachu, aswanpas.
That it is true.	Chiqap kasqanmanta.
Now he was scared again.	Kunanqa yapamanta mancharisqa.
Instead, I feel like it would have been.	Aswanpas kanman karqan hinan sientekuni.
Very important person	Ancha importante runa
This is how it should be.	Kay hinam kanan.
I could have done better maybe	Aswan allinta ruwayman karqan ichapas
I had no idea he lived here	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kaypi yachasqanmanta
I didn’t do that right.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu ruwarqani.
I didn’t mean that.	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu.
What are we.	Imataq kanchik.
Once a week is fine.	Semanapi huk kuti allinmi.
I had no choice, not anymore	Manañam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu, manañam
I just thought maybe you could	Chayllaraqmi yuyaykurqani ichapas chayta ruwawaq
He never did it.	Mana hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
He was terrified.	Payqa sinchita mancharisqa kasharqan.
And really, it's not too hard.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, manam ancha sasachu.
But that’s not working right now.	Ichaqa chayqa manan kunanqa allintachu llank’ashan.
I didn’t expect this to happen	Manam suyarqanichu kayna kananta
I didn’t want it to be unsafe.	Manam munarqanichu mana seguro kananta.
I wanted to be there	Chaypi kaytam munarqani
It seems easier that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi rikchakun.
I always thought you were too good for me	Sapa kutim piensarqani ñuqapaq llumpay allin kasqaykita
Okay, this is better.	Allinmi, kayqa aswan allinmi.
I’m anything but that	Ñuqaqa imapas kani ichaqa chaymanta
And that seems rather stupid.	Hinaspa chayqa aswan sonso hinam.
He is still very happy.	Payqa hinallam llumpayta kusisqa kachkan.
I take them seriously.	Chaykunataqa allintam hapini.
I knew what he wanted	Yacharqanim ima munasqanmanta
I’ve been there several times	Askha kutitan chayman rirqani
I feel very uncomfortable with that	Chaywanqa anchatam mana allintachu sientekuni
I knew this all along	Kaytaqa tukuy tiempon yacharqani
We have no idea this is going to happen.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanchik kay pasananta.
I can't say it's true	Manam niyta atiymanchu chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I knew he could wait	Yacharqanim suyayta atisqanmanta
To be able to.	Allin kananpaq.
He died a few hours later.	Payqa iskay kinsa hora qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I mean this all happened so fast	Niyta munani kayqa tukuy imapas chayna utqaylla pasasqanmanta
There is a present.	Kunanmi kan.
I never saw it coming.	Mana hayk’aqpas hamunanta rikurqanichu.
I have tried so hard, for so long	Anchatam kallpanchakurqani, ancha unayñam
I can’t understand it	Manam entiendeyta atiymanchu
I hear just about everything	Yaqa tukuy imatam uyarini
I wanted to make sure you were okay	Allin kasqaykita seguro kaytam munarqani
Considered out of nowhere.	Mana maypipas kasqanmanta qhawarisqa.
Nothing is alone there.	Chaypiqa manam imapas sapallanchu.
I want him to succeed and do better	Munani allinta ruwananta, aswan allinta ruwananta ima
We were always together.	Sapa kutim kuska kaq kayku.
I didn't want to leave it out here that long	Manam chayna unaytachu kay hawapi saqiyta munarqani
Many of us are like that.	Achka runakunam chayna kanchik.
I don’t understand it yet.	Manaraqmi entiendenichu.
You’re just yourself.	Qamqa qamllam kanki.
I wanted to be like you	Ñoqapas qan hinan kayta munarqani
I don't care who it is	Manam imananpaschu pi kasqanmantaqa
I couldn't sleep last night	Qayna tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqanichu
You know what you are.	Yachankim ima kasqaykita.
This is a one-off.	Kay huk kutilla.
It doesn’t matter here.	Kaypiqa manan imananpaschu.
Like two weeks ago.	Iskay semana ñawpaqta hina.
I couldn’t ignore that	Chaytaqa manan mana uyariyta atirqanichu
I know you are here.	Yachanim kaypi kasqaykita.
He had a good time.	Payqa allintam pasarqa.
That meant everything.	Chayqa tukuy imatam niyta munarqa.
I had to do what he said this morning	Kunan paqarin nisqanman hinam ruwanay karqa
Anyway, he knows.	Imayna kaptinpas, payqa yachanmi.
I am everything too	Ñuqapas tukuy imapas kani
I haven't seen him in about two years	Yaqa iskay watañam mana rikurqanichu
That was his name.	Chayqa sutinmi kasqa.
I can't say for sure if that's the case.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman sichus chayna kasqanmantaqa.
You’re not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kanki.
He looked rather sick.	Payqa aswan unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
So, it was very good.	Chaymi, ancha allin karqa.
I wanted that for a while last year.	Chaytaqa qayna wata huk tiempon munarqani.
There is nothing wrong with that	Manam imapas kanchu
Sure, today is not that day.	Seguro, kunan punchawqa manam chay punchawchu.
I wouldn’t be able to sleep either	Ñuqapas manam puñuyta atiymanchu karqa
But if you were.	Ichaqa sichus karqanki chayqa.
I think today is a good day	Yuyaykuni kunan p’unchay allin p’unchay kananpaq
It was a very special day.	Chayqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
I didn’t know what he was going to do about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta ima ruwananta
I didn’t want to talk anymore.	Manañam rimayta munarqanichu.
I learned that one night	Chaytaqa huk tutam yacharqani
I think you’ve done better.	Yuyaykuni aswan allinta ruwasqaykita.
He may not agree.	Manapaschá acuerdopichu kanman.
I am the prisoner, after all	Ñuqam kani carcelpi kaq, tukuy imamanta
You may have to do this several times.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá askha kutita ruwanayki kanqa.
I knew this would come one day	Yacharqanim kay huk punchaw hamunanta
I know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachani.
He couldn’t say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta atirqanchu.
I didn’t want to get home	Manam wasiyman chayayta munarqanichu
I mean he's doing this on purpose, though	Niyta munani kayta munasqanman hina ruwachkan, ichaqa
I didn’t really want anything	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas munarqanichu
So, say thank you.	Chaymi, gracias niy.
I can do this all day like nothing else	Kayta tukuy punchaw ruwayta atiyman mana imapas hinachu
I didn’t know at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu.
So, here they are!.	Chaymi, kaypi kachkanku!.
That made it twice as good	Chaywanmi iskay kuti aswan allin karqa
I can't believe this exists	Manam creeyta atiymanchu kay kasqanmantaqa
This is not a duplication.	Kayqa manam iskay kuti ruwaychu.
I just do it right away.	Chayllam ruwani.
I can never go anywhere without it	Mana chaywanqa manam haykapipas maymanpas riyta atiymanchu
I really need him.	Paytaqa anchatam necesitasaq.
I am so proud of you.	Anchatam orgulloso kani qammanta.
These are very interesting.	Kaykunaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I’d love to hear about it	Chaymanta uyariyta anchata munani
I wanted to ask you	Tapuyta munarqani
I want to help him out.	Payta yanapayta munani.
He must be the one.	Payqa kanan tiyan.
I couldn't believe it was him.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu pay kasqanmanta.
I just know they’re not together	Chaylla yachani mana kuskachu kasqankuta
I can't buy that	Chaytaqa manam rantiyta atiymanchu
I had no idea how true it would be	Manam piensarqanichu imayna chiqap kananta
I don't see why this is so difficult.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa kay ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
It was the day before he left.	Chayqa karqan ripunanpaq ñawpaq p’unchaymi.
They really want to do the right thing.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam munanku allin kaqta ruwayta.
I want to get home.	Wasiman chayayta munani.
I never thought he would	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chaynata ruwananta
I wish that wasn’t the case.	Munaymanmi mana chayna kananta.
What should he do?.	¿Imatan ruwanan?.
And that would be a good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi kanman.
You're prolonging this bad stuff.	Kay mana allin kaqta unayta ruwachkanki.
Be strong right now.	Kunanpacha sinchita kay.
And that's what he did here.	Hinaspa chaytam kaypi ruwarqa.
I can’t believe the guy was that stupid	Mana creeyta atiymanchu chay wayna chay sonso kasqanmanta
I heard about it a long time ago	Unayñam chaymantaqa uyarirqani
I was sad this time last year	Qayna wata kay kutipi llakisqa karqani
There was nothing I could do about it.	Chaytaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Not to anyone.	Mana pimanpas.
He says they are nice people.	Payqa sumaq runakuna kasqankuta nin.
I had no intention of doing that either	Ñoqapas manan chayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
It’s nice to talk to him about it.	Paywan chaymanta rimayqa sumaqmi.
You can certainly do that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwawaq.
But it just happened	Ichaqa chayllam pasarqa
I was sure he was going to be disappointed.	Seguro karqani hukmanyasqa kananta.
I’m looking forward to a good cup of coffee	Allin kukata suyachkani
This is the real world.	Kaymi chiqap pacha.
Maybe not anymore, not like before.	Ichapas manaña, mana ñawpaq hinachu.
Eventually he can walk again	Qhepamanmi yapamanta puriyta atin
I was tired this morning	Kunan paqarinmi sayk’usqa karqani
Experts often disagree.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa sapa kutim mana acuerdopichu kanku.
It was a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
He doesn’t know how to answer the question.	Payqa manan yachanchu tapuyta imayna kutichiyta.
I do it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruwani.
I probably saw him once or twice in town	Yaqapaschá huk kutita iskay kutita llaqtapi rikurqani
I don’t mean to say nothing like that.	Manam chaynataqa mana imatapas niyta munanichu.
I’ll probably go there	Yaqapaschá chayman risaq
I don’t want to say why.	Manam imarayku niyta munanichu.
I can't find the reason.	Manam tarinichu imarayku kasqanmanta.
I hope you like it	Suyachkani munasqaykita
Really excited about it.	Chiqamanta kusisqa chaymanta.
I’m not up to it.	Manam chayman hinachu kachkani.
I know this is all new	Yachanim kayqa tukuy ima musuq kasqanmanta
That, of course, is up to you.	Chayqa, chiqamanta, qammanta kanqa.
I had an idea that might work	Huk yuyayniyuqmi karqani, chaymi allin kanman
I didn’t want to see what would happen next.	Manam qawayta munarqanichu chaymanta imakuna pasananta.
It's very cold	Sinchi chiri
I mean, he talks about it every day	Niyta munani, sapa punchawmi chaymanta riman
If there is one.	Huk kaptinqa.
I really wanted it now	Kunanqa anchatam munani karqa
Clearly there’s something here.	Sut’inmi kaypi imapas kan.
I didn’t want to answer	Manam kutichiyta munarqanichu
Nothing will happen about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imapas kanqachu.
This is a great deal…	Kayqa huk hatun ruwaymi...
What is the problem.	Imataq sasachakuy.
I didn’t expect it to be that easy	Manam suyarqanichu chayna facil kananta
No one will ever do that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
I doubt there is more	Iskayrayani aswan kasqanmanta
Someone else is doing better.	Huk runam aswan allinta ruwachkan.
Now there is a third.	Kunanqa kimsa kaqmi kachkan.
This is what you can do.	Kaytam qamqa ruwawaq.
This morning was very bad.	Kunan paqarinmi ancha mana allin karqa.
Enough.	Achka.
That's the only thing that really needs to be done.	Chayllam chiqaptapuni ruwanapaq.
I hadn’t seen him before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan paytaqa rikurqanichu
I feel really bad about this	Chiqamanta mana allintachu kaymanta sientekuni
He went to teach.	Payqa yachachiqmi rirqa.
A black one, there	Huk yana kaq, chaypi
I’m the people.	Ñuqam kani runakuna.
That’s now caught.	Chay kunan hap’isqa.
You are doing a great job.	Anchatam ruwachkanki.
That’s what it does.	Chayqa chayta ruwan.
I always felt happy.	Sapa kutim kusisqa tarikurqani.
He wanted to get home.	Payqa wasinman chayayta munarqa.
You know that kind of thing.	Yachanki chay laya.
This can't last long	Kayqa manam unaytachu kanman
That’s a very good thing for me.	Chayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
But there has been this much before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayna achka karqa.
I mean, nobody.	Niyta munani, mana pipas.
It’s a nice thing to do.	Sumaqmi chayta ruwayqa.
And now, finally, it was here.	Hinaspa kunan, tukukuypi, kaypi karqan.
I don’t want to see it	Manam qawayta munanichu
There is no place for that.	Chaypaqqa manan maypipas kanchu.
It happened really fast.	Chiqaptam utqaylla pasarqa.
He said there were three of them.	Nisqa kimsa kasqankuta.
But I can’t stay there for very long	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu chaypi qhepakuyta atiyman
That shouldn’t be difficult.	Chayqa manan sasachu kanan.
I can’t think straight or think straight	Manam allintachu yuyaymanayta nitaq allinta yuyaymanayta atiyman
I feel silly and ridiculous	Mana yuyayniyuq, asikunapaq hinam tarikuni
I’m just that.	Ñuqaqa chaylla.
I figured it would be easy	Chay ruwayqa mana sasachu kananta yuyaykurqani
Just in time.	Tiempollanpi.
A terrible one, actually	Huk manchay, chiqaptaqa
There was no such thing as this.	Manam kay hinaqa karqachu.
Thank you, maybe.	Gracias, ichapas.
He couldn't wait any longer.	Manañam suyayta atirqachu.
However, it looks nice so that's great.	Ichaqa, sumaqmi rikchakun chaymi ancha allin.
I could never play like him	Manam haykapipas pay hinaqa pukllayta atiymanchu karqa
I couldn't sleep now	Kunanqa manañam puñuyta atirqanichu
But it wasn’t like that	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan
I'll do that.	Chaynatam ruwasaq.
I’m sure he’s never been there	Seguro kani mana hayk’aqpas chayman risqanmanta
That’s easy, but not easy.	Chayqa facilmi, ichaqa manan facilchu.
He didn’t know how to do it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta ruwananpaq.
I never noticed them.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa repararqanichu.
I can’t come now	Manam kunanqa hamuyta atiymanchu
He could make time.	Payqa tiempotan ruwayta atinman karqan.
I have a lot of thoughts on this.	Kaymantaqa achka yuyayniyuqmi kani.
You think you can, but you can’t.	Atisqaykita yuyaykunki, ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
I really didn’t know what to do	Chiqamanta mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I wasn't sure at first	Ñawpaqtaqa manam segurochu karqani
You want to, though.	Munanki ichaqa.
I can't believe anyone would do that	Manam creeyta atinichu pipas chayta ruwananta
Very nearly, anyway.	Ancha yaqa, imayna kaptinpas.
I knew what this was about	Yacharqanim imamanta kayqa kasqanmanta
I had a good idea of ​​what he was thinking	Allintam yuyaykurqani ima piensasqanmanta
Now he really wants one.	Kunanqa chiqaptam hukta munan.
She looks amazing.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
It’s not quite there yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu chaypiqa kachkan.
So I said, okay.	Chaymi nirqani, allinmi nispa.
It just seemed like the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruway hinallam rikchakurqa.
But it was hard, hard.	Ichaqa sasa, sasam karqa.
He is the one who is yours.	Paymi qampaq kaq.
I haven’t seen anything like it	Manam chaynataqa rikurqanichu
She may not always like him	Manapaschá sapa kutichu paytaqa gustan
I was really worried.	Chiqaptam llakisqa karqani.
Eventually I will do something big	Qhepamanmi hatun ruwayta ruwasaq
I want him to come back with you, too	Ñoqapas munani qanwan kutimunanta, nispa
I hope he is not disappointed.	Suyachkani mana hukmanyasqa kananpaq.
I thought it was funny	Asikunapaq hina kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
Not sure about that.	Mana seguro kanchu chaymanta.
He can’t do anything otherwise.	Manan huk hinaqa imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
He will be very proud of me.	Payqa anchatam orgulloso kanqa ñuqamanta.
I'm still kind of annoyed	Hinallam huk laya phiñasqa kachkani
There was never a reason	Manam haykapipas imaraykupas karqachu
I didn't think he had to go there	Manam piensarqanichu chayman rinan kasqanmanta
I feel so tired	Sinchi sayk’usqa hinan sientekuni
I probably like it a lot	Yaqapaschá anchata gustan
I really didn’t know much	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu yacharqani
Some quick action.	Wakin utqaylla ruway.
But he’s certainly not a bad guy.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana millay runachu.
But he wouldn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munanmanchu.
I was a little hard on you this morning	Kunan paqarinmi huk chhikanta sinchita qanpaq karqani
I never saw him again	Manañam paytaqa rikurqanichu
This is bad, but not a new bad.	Kayqa mana allinchu, ichaqa manam musuq mana allinchu.
He certainly knew that.	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin yacharqan.
He really, really was.	Payqa chiqaptam, chiqaptam karqa.
He must do what he wants.	Munasqanman hinam ruwanan.
Things will get a little more interesting here.	Kaypiqa imapas aswan sumaqmi kanqa.
I know you’re terribly busy	Yachanin manchay ocupasqa kasqaykita
Clearly, he could never do that.	Sut’inmi kashan mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atisqanmanta.
It’s going to be really good.	Chiqap allinmi kanqa.
Glad it was okay.	Kusisqa allin kasqanmanta.
I didn’t realize he was doing that	Chayta ruwasqanqa manan repararqanichu
Three.	Kimsa.
That’s the best thing.	Chaymi aswan allinqa.
But you have to do things.	Ichaqa imakunatapas ruwanaykipaqmi ruwanayki.
That’s what I wanted to do with it.	Chaytaqa chayta ruwayta munarqani chaywan.
But everyone knows what happened back then.	Ichaqa llapa runan yachanku chay tiempopi imachus pasasqanmanta.
Make it so that it is.	Chayna kananpaq ruway.
I immediately thought it was a good idea	Chayllam piensarqani allin yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I hope that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam suyachkani
He will have a good time of it.	Payqa allin tiempotan chaymanta kanqa.
I wasn’t happy, I mean	Manam kusisqachu karqani, niyta munani
Maybe you’re okay with that.	Ichapas chaywanqa allinta kachkanki.
That was a very surprising experience for me.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa ñuqapaq.
But I am very happy about this	Ichaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta
I’ve actually been there	Chiqaptaqa chaypim karqani
One, nothing stupid.	Huk, mana imapas sonso.
The next time around.	Qatiqnin kutipi.
I couldn't say why	Manam niyta atiymanchu karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t want to believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munarqanichu
Everything is good again.	Tukuy imapas yapamanta allinmi.
He knew that now.	Chaytaqa kunanqa yacharqanmi.
You’re also a pipe.	Qampas pipas.
I couldn’t let him get hurt	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu k’irisqa kananta
At least, that’s what it should be.	Aswanpas, chaymi kanan.
Do it right this time	Kay kutipi allinta ruway
If it isn’t, I don’t want it	Mana chayna kaptinqa manam munanichu
I just couldn’t see it.	Chaylla mana rikuyta atirqanichu.
He’s done it before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqan.
Maybe it’s not that bad.	Ichapas mana chayna mana allinchu.
Now, however, there was nothing left.	Kunanmi ichaqa manaña imapas karqachu.
I can't say anything about that	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu
I can't say anything for now	Kunankamaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu
We had to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanayku karqa.
They were very nice to us.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku ñuqaykuwan.
That’s how things should be done.	Chaynatam imatapas ruwana.
Maybe someone is home.	Ichapas pipas wasinpi kanman.
I am very, very sorry	Anchatam llumpayta llakikuni
But tomorrow night.	Ichaqa paqarin tuta.
They’re crazy.	Paykunaqa loco kanku.
You will certainly do it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwanki.
A really, really nice guy	Chiqap, chiqap sumaq runa
I do these things all the time	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim ruwani
It was sad, very sad.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa, ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I didn’t see that.	Manam chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
I thought you’d be fine	Allinmi kanki nispaymi yuyaykurqani
That was this guy.	Chayqa kay runam karqa.
I mean, it’s not the process	Niyta munani, mana chay ruwaychu
The process itself is not easy.	Kikin ruwayqa manan facilchu.
The bad is the bad.	Mana allinqa mana allinmi.
I think you know where	Yuyaykuni maypi yachasqaykita
It doesn’t matter now, though.	Kunanqa manan imananpaschu, ichaqa.
I don’t quite agree	Manam allintachu acuerdopi kani
I would love to live there	Chaypi tiyayta anchata munani
That’s what he wants.	Chaytan munan.
He was so very happy.	Payqa chayna ancha kusisqam karqa.
I really wanted that	Chaytaqa anchatam munarqani
I want to find the money	Chay qullqita tariyta munani
I am so excited to do this	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kayta ruwanaypaq
I hope it happens again	Suyachkani hukmanta pasananta
We’re all right.	Allinmi kayku.
I’m not here, very truly	Manam kaypichu kachkani, ancha chiqap
I thought it would be good	Allinmi kananta yuyaykurqani
That was stupid.	Chayqa sonso kaymi karqa.
You are not a good person.	Manam allin runachu kanki.
He may never have been here.	Payqa manapaschá hayk’aqpas kaypichu karqan.
I know why it went that way	Yachanim imanasqa chaynata rirqa
I never knew he was sick	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu unqusqa kasqanmantaqa
He couldn't see her, but then he didn't need to.	Payqa manan rikuyta atirqanchu, ichaqa chaymantaqa manan necesitarqanchu.
A few weeks ago	Iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqta
I can't tell you about this anymore	Manañam kaymantaqa willayta atiymanchu
Everything was set up perfectly.	Tukuy imapas allintam churasqa karqa.
I always thought it was, anyway	Sapa kutim piensarqani chayna kasqanmanta, imayna kaptinpas
This is what makes this process so fast.	Kaymi kay ruwayqa ancha utqaylla.
I wanted to see him after that	Chay qhepamanmi payta rikuyta munarqani
That wasn’t the right thing to do.	Chayqa manan allinchu kasharqan.
But not in everyday language.	Ichaqa manan sapa p’unchay simipi hinachu.
He didn’t want to go.	Payqa manan riyta munarqanchu.
I always wanted to see that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim qawayta munarqani.
I am anything but a yes person.	Ñuqaqa imapas kani aswanpas arí runam kani.
The truth was harder.	Cheqaq kaqmi aswan sasa karqan.
If you are truthful.	Sichus chiqap kanki.
We are not so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu kanchik.
I’ve always been like that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqani.
You are an important person.	Qamqa huk importante runam kanki.
I don’t see him most of the evening	Yaqa llapan ch’isi mana paytaqa rikunichu
That will happen tomorrow though.	Chayqa paqarinmi kanqa ichaqa.
I think you’re right.	Yuyaykuni allinta nisqaykita.
I know you can remember what that looked like	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta yuyariyta atisqaykita
I want to buy a car.	Huk carrota rantiyta munani.
Very unlike me.	Ancha mana ñuqa hinachu.
The problem of the hidden.	Pakasqa kaqta sasachakuy.
I saw no answer there	Chaypiqa manam kutichiyta rikurqanichu
No one wanted them.	Manan pipas chaykunataqa munarqanchu.
That sounds easy.	Chayqa facilmi uyarikun.
Now I was here.	Kunanqa kaypim karqani.
It certainly won’t be.	Chiqamanta mana kanqachu.
I wonder what I did wrong.	Tapukuni ima mana allinta ruwasqayta.
Probably a .	Yaqapaschá huk .
A slight chance, but better than nothing.	Huk pisi chansa, ichaqa aswan allin mana imamantapas.
I could see no other way	Manam huk ñanta rikuyta atirqanichu
I or my own.	Ñuqa icha ñuqapa.
He seemed a little nervous.	Huk chikan mancharisqa hinam karqa.
I thought this might be it.	Kaymi kanman nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
They are both happy.	Iskayninkum kusisqa kachkanku.
I now feel much better about what is happening now	Kunanqa aswan allintam sientekuni kunan imakuna pasasqanmanta
He wants to talk to you.	Paymi qanwan rimayta munan.
I could never let that happen	Manam haykapipas chayna kananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I was pretty miserable	Ñuqaqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqani
This was a very big deal for me.	Kayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi karqa ñuqapaq.
You better do what’s right.	Aswan allinta ruwanki imachus allin kaqta.
I could never get used to it	Manam haykapipas chaymanqa yachayta atirqanichu
I wasn’t always there for you	Manam sapa kutichu qampaq karqani
That's the only thing we're really very concerned about.	Chayllam chiqaptapuni ancha llakisqa kanchik.
I had to redo it twice	Iskay kutitam yapamanta ruwanay karqa
Yes, every other week.	Arí, sapa iskay semana.
So here it is.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan.
I think about it all the time.	Sapa kutim chayta piensani.
But then, something else happened.	Ichaqa chaymanta, huk imapas pasarqa.
He had a very quick mind.	Payqa ancha utqaylla yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I was completely caught up	Lliwmi hapisqa karqani
Even if it’s not good.	Mana allin kaptinpas.
I think that's what it's all about	Chayqa tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensani
He had a better idea.	Payqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I didn't think you could handle it	Manam piensarqanichu chayta aguantayta atisqaykita
But I kind of doubt it.	Ichaqa huk laya iskayrayani.
That’s a core feature.	Chayqa huk uma ruwaymi.
I want to get out of here as soon as possible.	Kaymanta usqhaylla lluqsiyta munani.
This is a great set up.	Kayqa hatun churasqa.
This will be easy.	Kayqa facilmi kanqa.
I am very anxious to do better	Anchatan llakikuni aswan allinta ruwanaypaq
There was a lot to do	Achkatam ruwana karqa
I can’t really say.	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu.
I want her to be better than him.	Munani paymanta aswan allin kananta.
One so scary she would do anything to keep it a secret.	Huk ancha manchay payqa imatapas ruwanman pakasqa kananpaq.
That’s set up.	Chayqa churasqa kachkan.
Better than anything else first.	Aswan allin imamantapas ñawpaqtaqa.
Be truly happy.	Cheqaqtapuni kusisqa kay.
I'm not going to make a big deal out of this	Kaymantaqa manam hatun ruwaytaqa ruwasaqchu
I’m the second girl saying.	Ñuqaqa iskay kaq sipasmi kani nispa.
I’ve thought about this for a long time	Unayñan kaypi yuyaykurqani
I couldn't figure out what was going on	Manam atirqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta
I didn't think he was going to be scared	Manam piensarqanichu mancharisqa kananta
But here are some things you can do.	Ichaqa kaypi wakin ruwaykunata ruwawaq.
He was too quick for her.	Payqa ancha utqayllam paypaq karqa.
I’m not the only one.	Manam chayllachu kani.
I think it should be.	Yuyaykuni chayna kananta.
It was time to act.	Ruwanapaq tiempon karqan.
A few hours ago I couldn't speak	Iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi mana rimayta atirqanichu
I was the one.	Ñuqam karqani.
I was disappointed and frustrated.	Chaywanmi hukmanyasqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
It must be injured.	K’irisqa kanan tiyan.
I doubt much will come of it.	Iskayrayani chaymanta achka hamunanta.
I couldn’t figure out how to do it	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imaynata chayta ruwanaypaq
I wanted to be someone else	Huk runa kaytam munarqani
I was tired, so, very tired	Sayk’usqa karqani, chaymi, ancha sayk’usqa
I have so much to do	Anchatam ruwanay kachkan
I think it turned out for the best though	Yuyaykuni allinpaq lluqsirqa ichaqa
I'm not so sure this is the case	Manam chayna segurochu kani kayna kasqanmanta
One no longer really knows who one is.	Huk runaqa manañam chiqaptachu yachan pi kasqanmanta.
I know what happens out there	Yachanim chay hawapi imakuna pasasqanmanta
I mean, you were there	Niyta munani, chaypi karqanki
They are great, they were great.	Paykunaqa hatunmi kanku, hatunmi karqaku.
That will soon be gone.	Chayqa pisi tiempollamantan manaña kanqachu.
He didn’t need to say more.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu astawan niyta.
There are no innocent people.	Manam mana huchayoq runakunaqa kanchu.
However, he was too tired to think about it further.	Ichaqa, ancha sayk’usqañan kasharqan, manan chaypi astawan yuyaykurqanchu.
Most people were constantly caught up in what was and what was.	Yaqa llapan runakunam sapa kutilla hapisqa karqaku imakuna kasqanmanta hinaspa imakuna kasqanmanta.
Everything is bigger than me.	Tukuy imapas ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi.
I’ve never been able to beat a game of it!.	¡Manan hayk’aqpas chaymanta huk pukllayta atipayta atirqanichu!.
He’s done it for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chayta ruwarqan.
But it’s okay.	Ichaqa allinmi kachkan.
But he might, one day.	Ichaqa payqa, huk p’unchaymi chayta ruwanman.
I want to do that	Chayta ruwayta munani
There is nothing you can do about it.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu chaymantaqa.
I am, yes, I am.	Ñuqaqa kani, arí.
I knew what we had to do	Yacharqanim ima ruwanayku kasqanmanta
I tried to do that	Chaytaqa ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
If it’s a mistake, it’s fine.	Pantasqa kaptinqa allinmi.
It’s not good though.	Manam allinchu ichaqa.
I’m just not sure.	Chaylla mana segurochu kani.
I sure hope it sure happens for me	Seguro suyachkani seguro ñuqapaq pasananta
Not sure that’s true.	Mana segurochu chay cheqaq kasqanmanta.
He’s not there.	Payqa manan chaypichu.
But he refused to speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
He is the best of it.	Paymi chaymantaqa aswan allinqa.
Some stranger.	Wakin mana riqsisqa runa.
I know where they are	Yachanim maypi kasqankuta
I was alone last night	Qayna tutam sapallay karqani
It’s a very sensible thing to do.	Ancha yuyayniyuq ruwaymi.
That’s just me though.	Chayqa ñuqallam ichaqa.
I didn't expect it today	Kunan punchawqa manam suyarqanichu
I was probably tired	Yaqapaschá sayk’usqa karqani
There was this strange night.	Chaypim kay mana riqsisqa tutaqa karqa.
He might want to buy it.	Yaqapaschá rantiyta munanman.
I wish things weren't like this	Munaymanmi imapas mana kayna kaptinqa
I don't think he lives there.	Manam piensanichu chaypi tiyasqanmanta.
They seem happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqa hinam kanku.
I can't imagine this.	Kaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
I didn’t know what to say at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan yacharqanichu ima niyta
I knew it wouldn't happen	Yacharqanim mana chayna pasananta
I can't be tired	Manam sayk'usqa kayta atiymanchu
Same thing again.	Kikin kaq yapamanta.
He wanted to go.	Paymi riyta munarqa.
I am a teacher.	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kani.
He was fine with it.	Payqa allinmi chaywanqa karqa.
It was something that needed to be done.	Chayqa ruwanapaq hinam karqa.
I always knew this was coming	Sapa kutim yacharqani kay hamunanta
But what is the probability?	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman?
Good morning people.	Allin punchaw runakuna.
There was some process involved.	Chaypaqqa wakin ruwaymi karqan.
It’s immediately caught.	Chaylla hap’isqa.
I just couldn’t go.	Chaylla mana riyta atirqanichu.
That’s that, that’s that.	Chay chay, chay chay.
I’m really tired now	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa sayk’usqa kashani
He looked nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Of course yes, he says.	Chiqamanta arí, nispas nin.
Someone has to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwanan.
I wonder how you do it	Imaynatataq ruwanki chayta tapukuni
Bad, bad problem.	Mana allin, mana allin sasachakuy.
Do, do, do, do.	Ruway, ruway, ruway.
I wanted to know who he was	Pi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
In most cases, this is a good thing.	Yaqa llapanpim chayqa allin.
One hour, two hours, three hours.	Huk hora, iskay hora, kimsa hora.
You know, you're a lot like me.	Yachankichu, ancha ñuqa hinam kanki.
Maybe several times.	Ichapas achka kutita.
I couldn’t bear to stay any longer	Manañan aguantayta atirqanichu qhepakuyta
They are all disappointed.	Llapallankum hukmanyasqa kachkanku.
This has been the case all along.	Kaymi tukuy tiempo karqan.
But that may not be the case.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I saw it for the first time	Ñawpaq kutitam rikurqani
I couldn't be offended by that	Chaywanqa manam phiñasqa kayta atirqanichu
But there is a positive.	Ichaqa kanmi allin kaq.
I couldn’t resist them	Chaykunataqa manan hark’ayta atirqanichu
What’s strong.	Imataq sinchi.
He did this for a while.	Huk tiempon chayta ruwarqan.
I have an idea of ​​what happened	Imakuna pasasqanmanta huk yuyayniyuqmi kani
I want to do the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayta munani
It's like nothing else.	Mana imapas huk hinam.
But here was something wrong.	Ichaqa kaypiqa imapas mana allinmi karqa.
A cold cold day.	Chiri chiri punchaw.
Said he needed an early night.	Nisqa huk tuta temprano necesitasqanmanta.
Maybe in the near future, but certainly not yet.	Ichapas chayllaraq hamuq tiempopi, ichaqa seguro manaraqmi.
There was a lot of action.	Achka ruwaymi karqa.
He knew now that he didn’t want to stop her.	Payqa kunanqa yacharqanmi mana hark’ayta munasqanta.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.	Imayna kaptinpas, kunanqa manam imananpaschu.
So far everything has been fine.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
And that was all in the last month.	Hinaspa chaylla karqan qhepa killapi.
I can't be sure here	Kaypiqa manam seguro kayta atiymanchu
That’s what’s available.	Chayqa tarikun.
We talked every few days.	Sapa iskay kimsa punchawmi rimaq kayku.
Very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaq.
I wasn’t bad at it	Manam mana allinchu karqani
I know you have a lot to do.	Yachanim achka ruwanayki kasqanmanta.
Everyone knows you’re there.	Lliwmi yachanku chaypi kasqaykita.
He’s crazy about you.	Payqa qammanta loco kachkan.
I know something is going to happen	Yachanim imapas kananta
I really wish it was different.	Chiqaptam munani huk hina kananta.
How can I do it.	Imaynatataq ruwayman.
I never wanted to play with him	Manam haykapipas paywan pukllayta munarqanichu
I didn’t want to be there	Manam chaypi kaytaqa munarqanichu
I didn’t hear him properly	Manam allintachu paytaqa uyarirqani
Can we do this? 	¿Atichwanchu kayta ruwayta?
I knew you were there	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqaykita
That's something, anyway.	Chayqa imapas, imayna kaptinpas.
Repeat and repeat.	Yapamanta ruway hinaspa yapamanta ruway.
I just know that person is trouble	Chaylla yachani chay runaqa sasachakuy kasqanmanta
So far I am not happy	Kunankamaqa manam kusisqachu kachkani
I think we did well there.	Chaypi allinta ruwasqaykumanta yuyaykuni.
I couldn’t not have this	Manan mana kaytaqa atiymanchu karqan
Sorry, kid, I can’t help it.	Pampachaykuway, wawa, mana yanapayta atinichu.
They are nothing like that.	Paykunaqa manan imapas chay hinachu kanku.
I should have done that earlier	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanay karqa
Maybe you do too.	Ichapas qampas ruwanki.
I was here a few times as a kid	Wawa kaspayqa iskay kimsa kutitam kaypi karqani
I thought that would be a good thing	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani
That’s what he did for me.	Chaytam ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
He cannot speak or think like a human.	Manam rimayta atinchu, nitaq runa hina yuyaymanayta atinchu.
First, duplicate the previous path.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñawpaq ñanta iskay kutita ruway.
I was really sad and worried	Chiqaptam llakisqa hinaspa llakisqa karqani
He couldn't hear anything.	Payqa manam imatapas uyariyta atirqachu.
They are not real.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqchu kanku.
He couldn’t see anyone.	Payqa manan pitapas rikuyta atirqanchu.
It’s really hard.	Chiqaptam sinchi sasa.
I know that he is.	Yachanim payqa chayna kasqanmanta.
A beautiful-looking man.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq runa.
Again, a no.	Yapamanta, huk mana.
He’s not good enough for you.	Payqa manan allinchu qanpaq.
There is a good reason for this	Chaypaqqa allinmi .
I just didn’t know that was the case	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
But he can’t say yes.	Ichaqa manan arí niyta atinchu.
It has been there for so long.	Chayna unayñam chaypi kachkan.
That would be him.	Chayqa paymi kanman.
I can't say that's right.	Chayqa manam allinchu niyta atiymanchu.
Now the next thing.	Kunanqa qatiqnin kaq.
I didn’t expect an answer	Manam suyarqanichu kutichiyta
He wouldn’t be what he is now.	Payqa manan kunan hinachu kanman karqan.
I can’t imagine who the second person might be	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu pi iskay kaq runa kanman chayta
I hope he gets caught	Suyachkani hapisqa kananta
He knew it well enough.	Payqa allintam yacharqa.
I want you wherever you are	Maypi kasqaykita munani
I thought it was very interesting.	Ancha sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
He can’t quite figure this out.	Payqa manan kaymantaqa allintachu entiendeyta atin.
He’s just that.	Payqa chaylla.
The day went well.	Chay punchawqa allintam pasarqa.
It’s easier to do it once.	Huk kutilla ruwayqa aswan facilmi.
But nobody really knew much about him.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu paymanta anchata yacharqan.
It may not be anymore.	Manapaschá manaña kanqachu.
He said it was wonderful.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha sumaqmi kasqanmanta nirqa.
I know who these people are	Yachanim pikuna kay runakuna kasqankuta
I know where they are now.	Yachanim kunan maypi kasqankuta.
I want to go home and	Munani wasiyman riyta hinaspa
Wasn’t it there.	Chaypichu kasqa.
I couldn't believe this existed	Manam creeyta atirqanichu kay kasqanmantaqa
It was too fast, too fast.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam karqa, ancha utqayllam karqa.
It’s the most beautiful thing.	Aswan sumaq kaqmi.
Someone had to do it	Pipas chayta ruwanan karqan
I wasn’t like a lot of people	Manam achka runakuna hinachu karqani
I knew it was coming	Yacharqanim chay hamunanta
We can’t say it.	Manam niyta atichwanchu.
I know you know what happened	Yachanin imachus pasasqanmanta yachasqaykita
That’s going to be huge.	Chayqa hatunmi kanqa.
This is where he was really happy.	Kaypim chiqap kusisqa karqa.
So it will do it.	Chaymi ruwanqa.
I know it wouldn't have been easy.	Yachanim mana facilchu kanman karqa.
That’s what this is.	Chayqa kaymi.
I can't stand it now.	Kunanqa manañam aguantayta atiymanchu.
I hope I have a better idea than you	Suyachkani qammanta aswan allin yuyayniyuq kayta
All that stuff if.	Tukuy chay ima sichus.
I didn’t know what to say or do	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta nitaq imatapas ruwanaypaq
I can't tell what he thinks	Manam willayta atinichu ima piensasqanmanta
They are so confused.	Chayna pantasqa kachkanku.
I knew it was the day	Yacharqanim chay punchaw kasqanmanta
I knew what was involved.	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
People want that.	Runakunaqa chaytam munanku.
A man with a name.	Runa sutiyuq runa.
I saw him last week.	Qayna semanan payta rikurqani.
Or here, one.	Utaq kaypi, huk.
Like regular people.	Sapa kuti runakuna hina.
The results would be surprising.	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi kanman.
I mean, sure he could do nice	Niyta munani, seguro payqa sumaq ruwayta atinman
I didn’t think like the people there	Manam chaypi kaq runakuna hinachu piensarqani
And that was today.	Hinaspa chayqa kunan p’unchaymi karqan.
These are easy to make at home.	Chaykunataqa manan wasipi ruway sasachu.
It was a big man thing.	Chayqa hatun runa kaqmi karqa.
I don't remember what day it was	Manam yuyarinichu ima punchaw kasqanmantaqa
I hope you're not too mad at him	Suyachkani mana ancha phiñasqa kasqaykita paywan
Not quite, anyway.	Mana allintachu, imayna kaptinpas.
Today was supposed to be a good day.	Kunan punchawmi allin punchaw kanan karqa.
He recognized the problem.	Payqa repararqanmi chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
But I would never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
That was three years ago.	Chayqa kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
The two of them.	Chay iskay.
I never saw him tonight	Manam haykapipas kunan tutaqa rikurqanichu
I can't wait to see it	Manam suyayta atiymanchu qawayta
I couldn’t leave it here	Manam kaypi saqiyta atirqanichu
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqa.
The process continues to this day	Chay ruwayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan
It used to be easy to talk to him.	Ñawpaqtaqa facilmi karqa paywan rimayqa.
I thought you were here	Yuyarqanim kaypi kanki nispa
You figure out another way	Huk ñanta yuyaykunki
I thought you wanted him to know	Yuyarqanim yachananta munanki nispa
No, no, before.	Mana, mana, ñawpaq.
Do what you have to do.	Ruway imatachus ruwanaykita.
Doesn't seem like much, does it.	Mana anchatachu rikchakun, ¿aw.
I didn’t see that.	Chaytaqa manam rikurqanichu.
This is what happened.	Kaymi pasarqa.
I didn’t want to see him	Manam paytaqa rikuyta munarqanichu
Maybe they always were	Ichapas paykunaqa sapa kutim chayna karqaku
I never thought of that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu
No, seriously, she is.	Manan, serio, payqa.
I can’t speak now	Manam kunanqa rimayta atiymanchu
I don’t understand that	Chaytaqa manan entiendenichu
Maybe I want to do that	Ichapas chayta ruwayta munani
I know why you did it today	Yachanim imanasqa kunan punchaw ruwasqaykita
You learned a new word today.	Kunan punchawmi huk musuq simita yacharqanki.
I really want to do that	Anchatan munani chayta ruwanaypaq
I feel so much better now.	Kunanqa ancha allintam sientekuni.
I really have to do something	Chiqaptam imatapas ruwanay
I knew it was too easy	Yacharqanim llumpay facil kasqanmanta
I know they are home somewhere.	Yachanim maypipas wasipi kasqankuta.
I learn to do everyday things	Sapa punchaw ruwaykunata ruwayta yachani
He knew he was in trouble, but he didn't care.	Payqa yacharqanmi sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta, ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Don’t be stupid.	Ama sonso kaychu.
I just knew who you were	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani pi kasqaykita
I mean what he meant in the past	Ñawpaqpi ima niyta munasqanmanta niyta munani
He thought he was the worst person in the world.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kay pachapi aswan millay runa kananpaq.
I didn’t realize it was wrong	Manam repararqanichu mana allin kasqanmantaqa
This isn’t the case.	Kayqa manan kanchu.
That was probably the biggest.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan hatun karqan.
I can’t be that stupid	Manam chayna sonso kayta atiymanchu
I can’t tell you anymore.	Manañam willayta atinichu.
I really hope you can do that	Chiqamanta suyachkani chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
I had a lot of good ideas, but nothing worked.	Achka allin yuyayniyuqmi kani, ichaqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Maybe I’ll have to do it again	Ichapas hukmanta ruwanay kanqa
I found out a week ago	Huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani
I thought that was a pretty good move	Chayqa allin allin ruway kasqanmantam piensarqani
He was a very difficult man.	Payqa ancha sasa runam karqa.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chayta ruwaytaqa munanichu.
She said no thanks.	Payqa manan gracias nispas nisqa.
It wasn't supposed to be such a big deal.	Manam chayna hatun ruwaychu kanan karqa.
Learn something else about it.	Chaymanta hukta yachay.
I never saw him again	Manañam haykapipas paytaqa rikurqanichu
That’s a girl.	Chayqa sipasmi.
I just saw it.	Chayraqmi rikurqani.
Maybe too soon.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla.
I couldn’t get to it	Chaymanqa manam chayayta atirqanichu
That couldn't be overcome.	Chayqa manam atipayta atirqachu.
No one can do anything about it.	Manan pipas imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
I want that as much as you do	Chaytaqa qan hinan munani
I can hear him now.	Paytaqa kunanmi uyarini.
The best thing anyone can do is be a teacher.	Pipas aswan allinqa yachachiq kaymi.
I wasn’t sure how long this would last	Manam segurochu karqani hayka tiempo kayqa kananmanta
I felt a little sad	Huk chhikantan llakisqa tarikurqani
I have no idea, actually	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani, chiqaptaqa
So that’s what he’s talking about.	Chaymi chaymanta rimachkan.
I can’t do that	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atiymanchu
I want to catch up now	Kunanqa hap’iyta munani
Unfortunately he can’t say that.	Llakikuypaqmi mana chayta rimayta atinchu.
He says yes to it.	Payqa arí nispas nin.
To go with him.	Paywan ripunanpaq.
I couldn't bear to look at him	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu payta qawayta
I still couldn't believe it was him	Hinallam mana creeyta atirqanichu pay kasqanmanta
What an amazing place to be.	Ima admirakuypaqmi chaypi kayqa.
I would like to leave.	Munaymanmi ripuyta.
He knew it was the right time.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay tiempo allin kasqanmanta.
More on that please.	Astawan chaymanta ama hina kaspa.
It’s actually amazing.	Chiqaptaqa admirakuypaqmi.
It’s not good, but it’s good.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa allinmi.
It goes very fast.	Ancha utqayllam rin.
I don’t want money.	Manam qullqita munanichu.
And then, nothing.	Hinaspa chaymanta, mana imapas.
A beautiful night.	Huk sumaq tuta.
I want to know why	Imarayku kasqanmanta yachayta munani
He almost refused.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana munarqanchu.
I’ll have to hurry up.	Usqhaylla ruwanay kanqa.
No one was anywhere.	Manam pipas maypipas karqachu.
Something doesn't seem right.	Imapas mana allintachu rikchakun.
A good little while, actually	Allin pisi pacha, chiqaptaqa
It’s one thing to be good.	Huk kaqmi allin kayqa.
And here he found himself.	Hinaspa kaypi tarikurqa.
Not a stupid kid	Mana sonso kaq wawa
Please say yes to it.	Ama hina kaspa, arí niy.
They’ve been with me for a long time.	Unayñan ñoqawan kashanku.
I didn't care that it was	Manam imananpaschu karqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
I’m crazy though	Ñuqam ichaqa loco kani
Now he couldn’t leave at all.	Kunanqa manan imapipas ripuyta atirqanchu.
He was a very strange man.	Payqa ancha mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
And, before.	Hinaspa, ñawpaq.
Now this is interesting.	Kunanqa kayqa sumaqmi.
I saw it at school, here	Yachay wasipi rikurqani, kaypi
People are nice, anyway.	Runakunaqa sumaqmi, imayna kaptinpas.
So it was a very difficult time	Chaymi ancha sasa tiempo karqa
It's actually not too bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
So it was easy.	Chaymi facil karqa.
I can’t do this now	Kunanqa manan kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
We are not like a second ago.	Manam huk iskay kaq ñawpaqta hinachu kanchik.
I don't know exactly.	Mana allintachu yachani.
I think we need to do this.	Kayta ruwananchik kasqanmanta yuyani.
Are they not there.	Manachu chaypichu kanku.
Maybe he really means it.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni niyta munan.
That’s what he did.	Chaynatam payqa ruwarqa.
I'm sure he is.	Seguro kani payqa kasqanmanta.
The night is young.	Tutaqa wayna.
But now it looks amazing.	Ichaqa kunanqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
So it’s good.	Chaymi allin.
He wanted everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam munarqa.
It was great in the big city.	Hatun llaqtapiqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Good sense though.	Allin yuyayniyuq ichaqa.
Sure, that’s a good thing.	Seguro, chayqa allinmi.
I don’t really think you mean sick of it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaywan unqusqa niyta munasqaykita yuyani.
I didn't have much to say about it	Manam anchatachu chaymanta rimanaypaq karqa
I can't wait to work	Manam llamkayta suyayta atinichu
I couldn’t walk all the way	Manam tukuyta puriyta atirqanichu
I had to make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwanay karqa
I couldn't figure out where it was	Manam maypi kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu
I know that is unbearable	Yachanim chayna ruwayqa mana aguantayta atisqanmanta
He knew how difficult it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna sasa ruway kasqanmanta.
That was pretty safe.	Chayqa ancha segurom karqa.
I am pretty sure of that	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro kani
Mine was always the hardest	Ñoqaqa sapa kutim aswan sasa karqa
There’s a .	Chaypin kan.
I really wanted to be with him	Paywan kaytam anchata munarqani
I couldn’t get over it yet	Manaraqmi chaywanqa tukuyta atirqanichu
I felt like I was there.	Chaypi hinam tarikurqani.
Like the last one.	Qhepa kaq hina.
Yes, they were.	Arí, chayna karqaku.
And boy was it such a day.	Hinaspa wayna chayna punchawmi karqa.
The first one failed.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana atirqanchu.
I can't believe he's gone	Manam creeyta atinichu manaña kasqanmantaqa
But I’ve never been able to get one	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas hukta hap’iyta atirqanichu
I really wish this didn't happen	Chiqaptam munayman kay mana pasananta
And the night you were arrested.	Hinaspa chay tuta hap’isqa kasqaykita.
He was the best man that was.	Payqa aswan allin runan karqan chaymi karqan.
Now he is the one.	Kunanqa paymi kan.
I really wanted to know what happened next	Anchatan munarqani chaymanta imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta
No he didn’t do it.	Manan payqa manan ruwarqanchu.
And then he began to explain why.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa imanasqa kasqanmanta willayta qallaykurqa.
I think very often.	Ancha sapa kutim piensani.
We’re fine,’ he says.	Allinmi kachkaniku’, nispas nin.
I’m genuinely nervous for the first time	Cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa kashani ñawpaq kutita
That is a very difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa llumpay sasam.
I know he meant nothing by that	Yachanim chaywanqa mana imatapas niyta munasqanmanta
I couldn't take this anymore	Manañam kayta hapiyta atirqanichu
I've never done that before	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu chayllaraq
Yes, yes you are.	Arí, arí qamqa kanki.
I don’t feel comfortable doing that	Chayta ruwaspaqa manan allintachu sientekuni
No one could see anything.	Manan pipas imatapas rikuyta atirqanchu.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Chaylla mana creeyta munarqanichu
I wasn’t surprised by that	Chaywanqa manam admirakurqanichu
There is no other way to do it.	Manam huk ruwayqa kanchu.
I finally did last year.	Qhepamanmi qayna wata chayta ruwarqani.
So very, very tired.	Chaymi ancha, ancha sayk’usqa.
I highly doubt he will come though	Ñuqaqa anchatam iskayrayani payqa hamunanta ichaqa
I wasn’t very happy.	Manam ancha kusisqachu karqani.
I have no idea what’s in there.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna chaypi kasqanmanta.
I never knew who was there	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pikuna chaypi kasqankuta
She was nicer than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder what ever happened to him	Tapukunitaqmi ima haykapipas paywan pasasqanmanta
If he couldn’t do it right, he wouldn’t do anything.	Sichus mana allinta ruwayta atinmanchu chayqa manan imatapas ruwanmanchu.
If true, it wasn’t good.	Chiqap kaptinqa manam allinchu karqa.
I don’t remember anything.	Manam imatapas yuyarinichu.
I knew it was me, always me	Yacharqanim ñuqa kasqayta, sapa kuti ñuqa
I didn’t know when or how it would happen	Manam yacharqanichu haykapi hinaspa imayna pasananta
If not, it would be fine.	Mana chayna kaptinqa, allinmi kanman.
So it’s a very good thing.	Chaymi ancha allin.
I often wonder what he is doing now.	Sapa kutim tapukuni kunan ima ruwasqanmanta.
Everything is fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi
I couldn’t go there	Manam chayman riyta atirqanichu
Great for me.	Hatun ñuqapaq.
Everything else.	Tukuy imapas.
I didn’t know how to stop her from everything	Manam yacharqanichu tukuy imamanta imayna harkayta
Man, that would be great.	Runa, chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I would love to see him do it again	Anchatan munani hukmanta ruwasqanta rikuyta
It would be after that.	Chay qhepamanmi kanman karqan.
And what it looks like today.	Hinaspa kunan punchaw imayna kasqanmanta.
If he doesn’t.	Mana ruwaptinqa.
No big secret though.	Mana hatun pakasqa ichaqa.
This was a very special day	Kayqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa
It seemed familiar.	Chayqa riqsisqa hinam karqa.
No, I will never do it again	Manam, manañam haykapipas ruwasaqchu
That’s a secret.	Chayqa pakasqa.
I am so glad that I am	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqaymanta
More than anything else.	Aswan tukuy imamanta.
You’re going to be happy.	Kusisqam kanki.
I can't see it like mine yet	Manaraqmi ñuqapa hinaqa qawayta atinichu
For about an hour.	Huk hora hina.
And that wouldn’t be too bad, would it?.	Hinaspa chayqa manan ancha mana allinchu kanman, ¿aw?.
I said he was a great player	Ñuqaqa hatun pukllaqmi nispaymi nirqani
Who knew what was going on.	Pitaq yacharqan imachus pasashasqanmanta.
I know it is not easy for you	Yachanim qampaq mana facilchu kasqanmanta
And then he was angry.	Hinaspa chaymanta phiñasqa kasqa.
He couldn’t go on like that.	Payqa manan chay hinata puriyta atirqanchu.
I never wanted to	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu
Thirty-three.	Chunka kimsa chunka.
I am very proud of what we have accomplished	Anchatam orgulloso kani ima ruwasqaykumanta
But everything else.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas.
All of these were found to be significant.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ancha riqsisqa tarikurqa.
I think you should do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I didn't realize he was there	Manam repararqanichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa
He was a morning man.	Payqa paqarin runam karqa.
I won’t do anything for you	Manan imatapas qanpaq ruwasaqchu
If so, where.	Chayna kaptinqa maypi.
I saw that he was at home	Wasinpi kashasqanmantan rikurqani
I wonder what that is all about	Tapukuni imamantataq chay kasqanmanta
Obviously someone didn’t want it for some reason.	Sut’inmi pipas mana munarqanchu imaraykupas.
So everything should be fine.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allin kanan.
It's been a long time indeed	Ancha unayñam chiqaptapuni
I want it to be just that	Munani chaylla kananta
I didn’t have much time	Manam ancha tiempoy karqachu
I don’t want to help.	Manam yanapayta munanichu.
I hope that it is.	Suyachkani chayna kananpaq.
I didn’t know who these people were	Manam yacharqanichu pikuna kay runakuna kasqankuta
It probably wouldn’t be better.	Manachá aswan allinchu kanman.
This should be a good practice.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi kanan.
He wants her to be successful	Payqa munanmi allin kananpaq
Too bad he's not here anyway.	Llakikuypaqmi payqa mana kaypichu kachkan chayna kaptinpas.
But they know it’s there.	Ichaqa chaypi kashasqanmantan yachanku.
I don’t know what, really.	Mana yachanichu imata, chiqaptapuni.
He was always there.	Sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
I would never do anything	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwaymanchu karqa
I think he realized it was me	Yuyaykuni, payqa repararqanmi ñoqa kasqayta
As always, he probably doesn’t know.	Sapa kuti hina, payqa manapaschá yachanchu.
I mean, something happened today	Niyta munani, kunan punchaw imapas pasarqa
A year younger than him	Paymanta huk wata sullk’a
That was the first time.	Chayqa ñawpaq kutim karqa.
I can never say how many.	Manam haykapipas niyta atiymanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
This was supposed to be.	Kayqa kanan karqan.
And it was always worse.	Hinaspa sapa kuti aswan mana allin karqan.
I really want to tell you that	Chaytaqa anchatam willayta munani
I would like to be a very famous person	Munaymanmi ancha riqsisqa runa kayta
I know that and that is important	Chaytaqa yachanim chaymi ancha allinqa
I didn’t hear that.	Mana chayta uyarirqanichu.
I didn't think he could do this	Manam piensarqanichu kayta ruway atisqanmanta
I can’t let that happen	Manam chay pasananta saqiyta atiymanchu
This doesn’t mean ‘nice to do’.	Kayqa manan niyta munanchu ‘sumaq ruway’.
I didn’t know things	Manam imakunatapas yacharqanichu
Not everything went smoothly.	Manam tukuy imapas allintachu rirqa.
I don’t have anyone to talk to.	Manam piwanpas rimanaypaq kanchu.
First of all, about me.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñuqamanta.
I thought maybe someone was sick or something	Yuyarqanim ichapas pipas unqusqa utaq imapas
And go now.	Hinaspa kunan riy.
I saw him three days ago	Kimsa punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani
It’s not too difficult.	Manam ancha sasachu.
Now I really wanted a cigarette	Kunanqa anchatam munarqani cigarrota
Not sure where he went wrong.	Mana segurochu maypi pantasqa kasqanmanta.
It would have been really bad.	Chiqamanta mana allinchu kanman karqa.
How am I going to do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwasaq.
He finally looked at her.	Qhepamanmi qhawarirqan payta.
Man, but more.	Runa, ichaqa aswan.
I was always the smart one	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim chay yachaysapa karqani
And I'm very tired.	Hinaspa ancha sayk'usqa kachkani.
But no one is good enough.	Ichaqa manan pipas allinchu.
He knew he was in trouble that day.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay p’unchay sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
I can’t really tell you yet	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa willayta atiymanchu
There was no chance.	Manam chansa karqachu.
I’m pretty tired of it	Chaywanmi allinta sayk’usqa kashani
I was lucky that he was there	Suerteyoqmi karqani chaypi kasqanmanta
I'm very stupid.	Ancha sonso kani.
It's been ten days so far.	Kunankamaqa chunka p'unchawmi.
I don't want to see what's going on now	Manam munanichu kunan imakuna kasqanmanta qawayta
He wants to do it for her again.	Payqa hukmanta paypaq ruwayta munan.
So far, he hasn’t done that.	Kunankamaqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I mean, if you’re not ready yet.	Niyta munani, sichus manaraq listochu kanki chayqa.
He wants things to be as they should be.	Payqa munanmi imapas imayna kanan hina kananta.
They want to work.	Paykunaqa llamkayta munanku.
He never had any choice.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I know how busy you are	Yachanim imayna ocupasqa kasqaykita
I want to know what’s going on	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I barely saw him	Yaqapaschá paytaqa rikurqani
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana imatapas ruwanaykita.
Not then, anyway.	Mana chaymanta, imayna kaptinpas.
I still can't figure it out	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atinichu
But you’re still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkanki.
It’s not a good day for me.	Manam allin punchawchu ñuqapaq.
I wanted to know who it was	Pichus chay kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
All right, this is it.	Allinmi, kaymi.
I couldn't believe he was serious	Manam creeyta atirqanichu serio kasqanmanta
I'm doing the work.	Llamk'ayta ruwachkani.
I don’t mean it that way.	Manam chaynatachu niyta munani.
I had to do something	Imapas ruwanay karqa
Which was good for me.	Imataq ñuqapaq allin karqa.
It’s better than that.	Aswan allinmi chaymantaqa.
I was immediately surprised.	Chayllam admirakurqani.
I want to know exactly where you are	Maypi kasqaykita allinta yachayta munani
I really thought this was above and beyond	Chiqaptam piensarqani kayqa hawapi hinaspa hawapi kasqanmanta
But I know better	Ichaqa aswan allintan yachani
I mean, seriously great	Niyta munani, serio hatun
These are smart people.	Kaykunaqa yachaysapa runakunam.
That is usually not a good thing.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim mana allinchu.
He's not sure yet.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kachkan.
I always learn something	Sapa kutim imatapas yachani
I didn’t think much of it	Manam anchatachu chaypi piensarqani
I had no choice but to be with him	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu paywan kuska kayta
It was a crazy night.	Chayqa loco tutam karqa.
I don’t remember being young	Manam yuyarinichu wayna kasqaymanta
I could never figure out what that thing was	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu ima chay imapas kasqanmantaqa
He just got out of there	Chaylla chaymanta lluqsirqa
I won't be here much longer	Manam aswan unaytachu kaypi kasaq
A true type.	Huk chiqap laya.
Neither one nor that.	Ni huk nitaq chaymantaqa.
Well, a lot of it.	Allinmi, achka.
He’s better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi.
He stayed there a few months and died.	Chaypin iskay kinsa killa qhepakurqan, hinan wañupurqan.
That will happen very soon.	Chayqa ancha pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
I think that’s the way it is	Chaynatam piensani
That means you’re out of town.	Chayqa llaqtamanta hawapi kasqaykita niyta munan.
I didn’t see any other way	Manam huk ñanta rikurqanichu
He said, he's right, you know.	Payqa nisqa, payqa allintam rimachkan, yachanki.
It is either one or the other.	Hukninmi icha hukninmi.
That’s kind of amazing.	Chayqa huk laya admirakuypaqmi.
You know what you want.	Yachankim ima munasqaykita.
It’s better to be a good person.	Aswan allinmi allin runa kay.
I didn’t hear those things.	Chaykunataqa mana uyarirqanichu.
I saw him a few weeks ago	Paytaqa iskay kinsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani
This is what he gave me.	Kaytam quwarqa.
That he’s sure.	Chayqa payqa seguro kasqanmanta.
I really wasn’t a good person	Cheqaqtapunin mana allin runachu karqani
I don’t want to put up with it anymore	Manañam aguantayta munanichu
I am very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
Very, very good	Ancha, ancha allin .
I’ll be a good guy.	Allin wayna kasaq.
I wasn’t happy about it	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu karqani
I hear it all the time	Tukuy tiempon chayta uyarini
I could have gotten there sooner	Chaymanqa aswan utqayllam chayayta atiyman karqa
I have no idea what happened	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna pasasqanmanta
I am sure he will do well.	Payqa allintam ruwananmanta seguro kani.
This means a lot to me.	Kayqa anchatam ñuqapaq niyta munan.
I thought it was everything.	Tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I’ll probably go home	Yaqapaschá wasiyman risaq
I can’t imagine that	Manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I can’t answer now	Manam kunanqa kutichiyta atiymanchu
Three different people.	Kimsa chikan runakuna.
It took me a year to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi huk wata pasarqa.
They were like that.	Paykunaqa hinam karqaku.
I thought that was a good moment	Chayqa allin rato kasqanmantam piensarqani
It’s really not difficult.	Chiqaptaqa manam sasachu.
He left something behind.	Payqa imatapas saqirqa.
I still couldn't believe he was with me	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atirqanichu ñuqawan kasqanmanta
Maybe that will be easier for you to do.	Ichapas chay ruwayqa qampaq aswan facil kanqa.
I knew he didn't want to be there	Yacharqanim mana chaypi kayta munasqanmanta
I am trying to make it better	Aswan allin kananpaqmi kallpanchakuchkani
I can't look at him now	Manam kunanqa paytaqa qawayta atiymanchu
I really, really like him	Paytaqa anchatam, anchata gustan
I almost, almost, didn’t hear it	Yaqa, yaqa, mana uyarirqanichu
But not so fast.	Ichaqa manan chay hina usqhayllachu.
Now they are.	Kunanqa paykunaqa kanku.
I don't think it's out there anywhere.	Manam maypipas hawapi kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
So there were two.	Chaymi iskay kasqa.
Father, father, father.	Ama, ama, ama.
I wasn’t in a position to do anything	Manam imatapas ruwanaypaq hinachu karqani
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa karqan hina.
Please let me know if you are interested.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway sichus munanki chayqa.
If nothing else goes wrong.	Mana imapas mana allin kaptinqa.
This is how I do it, actually	Kay hinam ruwani, chiqaptaqa
I can do that some time later	Chaytaqa huk tiempo qhepamanmi ruwayman
I don’t want to go there again	Manam yapamanta chayman riyta munanichu
This process didn’t really do it	Kay ruwayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan
Everything will be great.	Tukuy imapas hatunmi kanqa.
I am doing better.	Aswan allintam ruwachkani.
Very large house.	Ancha hatun wasi.
I had never heard him say that before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan uyarirqanichu chayta nisqanta
He doesn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykunchu.
He didn't quite know how to say it.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imayna niyta.
He probably didn't do that.	Payqa manapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I may not have said it right	Manapaschá allintachu nirqani
Be where you’re happiest.	Maypichus aswan kusisqa kashanki chaypi kay.
And then the next step is.	Hinaspa chaymanta qhipa kaq ruwayqa.
So we are.	Chaymi kanchik.
I cannot say what it will be like	Imayna kanqa chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu
Many people were there	Achka runakunam chaypi karqaku
I didn’t know who he was	Manam yacharqanichu pi kasqanmantaqa
All very quickly.	Tukuy ancha utqaylla.
I had no idea what would happen	Manam piensarqanichu imakuna pasananta
Yes, yes, yes	Arí, arí, arí .
I am very much about that.	Ñuqaqa chaymantaqa anchatam kani.
I wouldn’t have done anything	Manam imatapas ruwaymanchu karqa
It’s always the same.	Sapa kutim chayna.
But it’s easier.	Ichaqa aswan facilmi.
She is extremely beautiful.	Payqa sinchi sumaqmi.
That’s how I want it to be here.	Chaynatam munani kaypi kananta.
And he’s serious.	Hinaspa payqa serio.
I didn't really want to see it anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam anchatachu qawayta munarqani
But now he couldn’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan atirqanchu.
I still said it very well.	Kunankamapas ancha allintam nirqani.
He did something about it.	Payqa imatapas ruwarqa.
He was very happy with me.	Payqa ancha kusisqam ñuqawan karqa.
You can’t say it.	Manan niyta atiwaqchu.
All kinds of things.	Tukuy laya imakuna.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little bit.	Ichapas achka, ichapas huk chikan.
I couldn't sleep anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam puñuyta atirqanichu
I never wanted you to get hurt	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu k'irisqa kanaykita
I thought you would.	Yuyarqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I was sure it was him	Seguro karqani pay kasqanmanta
He doesn’t sound surprised.	Payqa manan admirasqa hinachu uyarikun.
Let’s hope it doesn’t.	Suyasun mana chayna kananta.
For some reason then.	Imaraykupas chaymanta.
I can’t sleep either.	Ñuqapas manam puñuyta atinichu.
So we have to do something about it.	Chaymi chaymantaqa imatapas ruwananchik.
Every evening, he sat there.	Sapa ch’isi, chaypi tiyaq kasqa.
He really wanted to talk to her.	Payqa anchatan paywan rimayta munarqan.
That was a secret.	Chayqa pakasqa kasqa.
I didn’t see how he could	Manam rikurqanichu imayna atisqanmanta
The earlier the better.	Aswan ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi.
And then there’s it? 	Hinaspa chaymanta?
It’s not today.	Manam kunan punchawchu.
It won’t be easy for you.	Manam facilchu kanqa qampaq.
This, of course, makes good sense.	Kayqa, chiqamanta, allin yuyayniyuq.
Again, it was two months after that.	Yapamanta, iskay killa chaymanta karqan.
To know that he is at home.	Wasinpi kasqanmanta yachananpaq.
I don’t need that long	Manam chayna unaytachu necesitasaq
Something interesting happened today.	Kunan punchawmi huk sumaq kaq pasarqa.
I know it wouldn't be easy	Yachanim mana facilchu kanman
But they are here somewhere.	Ichaqa maypipas kaypim kachkanku.
I can't say enough about that	Chaytaqa manam allintachu rimayta atiyman
So now it’s.	Chaymi kunanqa.
I have nothing to say about that.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas rimanaypaq kanchu.
He knew he was stupid.	Payqa yacharqanmi sonso kasqanmanta.
I want to be there for you.	Chaypi kaytam munani qampaq.
This is a really quick process.	Kayqa chiqap utqaylla ruwaymi.
I didn’t know if he was happy or not	Manam yacharqanichu kusisqachu icha manachu
It wasn’t the case.	Manan chay hinachu karqan.
You certainly do.	Qamqa chiqaptam ruwanki.
It’s the scariest thing.	Aswan manchay kaqmi.
I'm always alone, really alone	Sapa kutim sapallay kani, chiqaptapuni sapallay
I wonder why that is	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta
It was no longer useful	Manañam imapaqpas karqachu
I don’t know what, still	Manam yachanichu imata, kunankamapas
For better, or for worse.	Allinpaq, utaq mana allinpaq.
I’m really excited.	Chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani.
I didn’t know why he did it	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta
I just kind of found myself here	Chayllaraqmi kaypi huk laya tarikurqani
I'm not sure that's a bad thing.	Manam segurochu kani chay mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
There is no time for that.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempo kanchu.
I hadn’t heard that in a long time	Unayñan chaytaqa manaña uyarirqanichu
I want to do that one night.	Chayta huk tuta ruwayta munani.
I didn’t know what he was saying	Manam yacharqanichu ima nisqanmanta
I was married to myself.	Ñuqam casarasqa karqani.
I really didn’t know what to say	Chiqamanta mana yacharqanichu ima niyta
I think this is the best.	Kaymi aswan allin kananpaq yuyaykuni.
It really makes a lot of sense.	Chiqamanta anchata yuyayniyuq.
I hope there is nothing from this.	Suyachkani kaymanta mana imapas kananpaq.
I think I’d better talk to you	Yuyaykuni aswan allin kanman qanwan rimayta
I wish that happened more often	Aswan sapa kuti chayna kananta munayman
I really wanted to understand more	Cheqaqtapunin munarqani aswan entiendeyta
I hear them all the time	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim uyarini
I barely knew what it was	Yaqapaschá yacharqani ima kasqanmanta
We are two people.	Iskay runam kanchik.
That would just be me.	Chayqa ñuqallam kanman.
I’m the ultimate nice guy	Ñuqaqa kani chay qhipa sumaq runa
I don’t want to do anything else.	Manam huk ruwaytaqa munanichu.
I don’t think about it either	Ñoqapas manan chaymantaqa yuyaykunichu
Then I can do it twice.	Chaymantaqa iskay kutitam ruwayta atiyman.
I’m doing that right now	Kunanqa chayta ruwachkani
So he wanted to talk to me.	Chayraykum payqa ñuqawan rimayta munarqa.
Maybe something new every week.	Ichapas sapa semana musuq imapas.
I can't help with that	Chaypiqa manam yanapayta atiymanchu
It has to be great.	Hatun kanan tiyan.
It has never been easier.	Manam haykapipas aswan facilchu karqa.
He probably needs the money.	Payqa yaqapaschá chay qolqeta necesitan.
I think it would do great good	Yuyaykuni hatun allinta ruwanman
What are you doing here for so long? 	¿Imatataq kaypi unayta ruwanki?
How did you say it.	Imaynatataq nirqanki.
I am very sorry about that	Chaymantam anchata llakikuni
This says a lot.	Kayqa achkatam nin.
He never took it long.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas unaytachu hap’irqan.
I am not sure why	Manam segurochu kani imarayku kasqanmantaqa
Maybe it was two in the morning.	Ichapas iskay hora tutamanta karqa.
I just didn’t quite know what to do about it	Chaylla mana allintachu yacharqani chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq
He couldn't ask that.	Chaytaqa manam tapuyta atirqachu.
No, it’s better not.	Manan, aswan allinmi mana.
I didn’t mean you were	Manam niyta munarqanichu chayna kasqaykita
But it wouldn’t be a good idea.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
She was something, a real beauty.	Payqa imapas karqa, chiqap sumaq kaymi karqa.
All the traveling people.	Tukuy puriq runakuna.
Once or twice, maybe more.	Huk kuti iskay kuti, ichapas aswan achkata.
To know what to do.	Ima ruwananta yachananpaq.
So now a lot of time has passed.	Chaymi kunanqa ancha tiempota pasarqa.
He’s probably the first person.	Payqa yaqapaschá ñawpaq runa.
He was sad and worried.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa kasqa.
And after that, he would have liked it.	Hinaspa chayta qhepaman, payqa munanman karqan.
If you know, you know.	Yachanki chayqa, yachanki.
He knows the consequences.	Payqa yachanmi chaymanta imakuna kananta.
I was fine with that	Chaywanqa allinmi karqani
He’s good at it.	Payqa allinmi chaypi.
I’m very proud of what I’ve done	Anchatan orgulloso kani chay ruwasqaymanta
Everyone doing a great job.	Tukuy runa hatun ruwayta ruwaspa.
Because I am.	Ñoqa kasqaymanta.
I didn't know he was ever in prison	Manam yacharqanichu haykapipas carcelpi kasqanmantaqa
There I kind of decided to do it.	Chaypin huk hinata yuyaykurqani chayta ruwanaypaq.
Go, young man.	Riy, wayna.
Not if he can wait.	Mana sichus suyayta atinman chayqa.
Now I have to do this	Kunanqa kayta ruwanay tiyan
I can come there every day	Sapa punchawmi chayman hamuyta atiyman
He wanted to.	Payqa munarqa.
He wanted to know who it was.	Payqa pichus chay runa kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
I felt like a mistake.	Pantasqa hinam tarikurqani.
I couldn’t be either	Ñuqapas manam kayta atirqanichu
I never noticed how attractive she was	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantaqa
Better than nothing.	Mana imamanta aswan allinqa.
It does the job.	Chay llamk’ayta ruwan.
I can’t talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
I couldn’t ignore him	Manam paytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanichu
The man declined to be identified.	Chay runaqa manan pichus kasqanmanta willayta munarqanchu.
I always want to see it	Sapa kutim qawayta munani
But of course it’s not.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
I heard it, still	Uyarirqanim, hinallam
I couldn’t find it	Manam tariyta atirqanichu
I couldn’t see him yet	Manaraqmi paytaqa rikuyta atirqanichu
I hear it’s good, it’s great.	Uyarini allin kasqanmanta, ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Everything is not good for you.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu qampaq.
But it will come soon.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi hamunqa.
I couldn't tell you that.	Chaytaqa manam willayta atirqanichu.
I heard something	Imatapas uyarirqanim
Perhaps he should have.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanan karqan.
I’m glad this is the case.	Kusikuni kayna kaptinqa.
He was there but couldn’t see her.	Chaypin kasharqan ichaqa manan rikuyta atirqanchu.
Not here, anyway.	Mana kaypichu, imayna kaptinpas.
Otherwise I would be here sooner	Mana chayqa aswan utqayllam kaypi kayman karqa
I cannot say this enough	Kaytaqa manam allintachu niyta atiyman
He says he wants the job.	Paymi nin chay llamkayta munani.
I'm sure I'm proud of him	Seguro kani paymanta orgulloso kani
Wouldn’t that really be better?!.	¿Manachu chayqa chiqaptapuni aswan allin kanman?!.
This was just another one.	Kayqa huk hinallam karqa.
Now tell me what happened.	Kunanqa willaway imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I thought that was stupid.	Chaytaqa sonso kananpaqmi piensarqani.
I actually think he expected that	Chiqaptaqa piensani chayta suyasqanmanta
A year or two.	Huk utaq iskay wata.
I almost feel good again	Yaqapaschá hukmanta allinta sientekuni
I’m exhausted now, but it was worth it	Kunanqa sayk’usqañan kashani, ichaqa allinmi karqan
But that can be counterproductive.	Ichaqa chaymi mana allintachu ruwanman.
They were all black.	Llapallankum yana karqaku.
I'm actually happy	Chiqaptaqa kusisqam kachkani
In fact, he probably did.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
Yes, it’s all there.	Arí, tukuy chaypi kachkan.
As usual, I was alone	Sapa kuti hinam sapallay karqani
No, that sounds stupid.	Manan, chayqa sonso hinan uyarikun.
I don't think I'm going to do that	Manam chayta ruwanaypaqqa piensanichu
But we have a pretty good idea.	Ichaqa allin allin yuyayniyuqmi kayku.
I can’t do anything like that	Manam chaynataqa imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I know he wants to tell himself	Yachanim pay kikin willayta munasqanmanta
It’s good to be here.	Allinmi kaypi kayqa.
There is no good idea.	Manam kanchu allin yuyayniyuq.
I still can't talk about it	Kunankamapas manam chaymanta rimayta atinichu
He couldn't do that.	Payqa manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqachu.
It was not as popular as it could have been.	Manam atisqanman hinachu ancha riqsisqa karqa.
He’s going to be worse.	Payqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
I have no idea if that is true.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani sichus chay chiqap kasqanmantaqa.
I didn’t do those things	Manam chaykunataqa ruwarqanichu
Beautiful afternoon.	Sumaq tarde.
That there is a bigger problem.	Aswan hatun sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I love your opinion.	Anchatan munani yuyaykusqaykita.
But I couldn’t believe it	Ichaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu
It would be nice if you didn’t want to say why.	Allinmi kanman mana imarayku niyta munaspaqa.
That is certainly the case.	Chayqa segurom kachkan.
I'm still not sure why	Kunankamapas manam segurochu kani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I don’t want to be here anymore	Manañam kayta munanichu
You want to be there.	Chaypi kaytam munanki.
I didn't know it before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam yacharqanichu
I still wasn’t too sure	Hinallam mana ancha segurochu karqani
I can’t seem to help it	Manapaschá yanapayta atiymanchu hina
I couldn’t see it anywhere	Manam maypipas rikuyta atirqanichu
I want to leave him for good	Payta allinpaq saqiyta munani
He asked about you.	Paymi qanmanta tapurqan.
Less, anyway.	Aswan pisi, imayna kaptinpas.
He wants to go with you.	Qanwan riyta munan.
It was a small task.	Chayqa pisi ruwaymi karqa.
But it was really hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa karqan.
I can’t wait!!.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu!!.
It’s really very sad.	Chiqamanta ancha llakisqa.
I was just in the car	Chayllaraqmi chay carropi karqani
They weren’t happy, they were happy.	Paykunaqa mana kusisqachu karqanku, aswanpas kusisqa karqanku.
He was really very.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha karqa.
They obviously want to make it right.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi chayta allinta ruwayta munanku.
And you want to talk about how it is.	Hinaspa imayna kasqanmanta rimayta munanki.
Either that, or worse.	Icha chay, icha aswan mana allin.
But it was still there.	Ichaqa hinallam karqa.
He didn’t want to seem nervous.	Payqa manan mancharisqa hina kayta munarqanchu.
They know what it’s like.	Paykunaqa yachanku imayna kasqanmanta.
That would certainly be a good thing.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allin kanman.
Or me, anyway.	Utaq ñuqa, imayna kaptinpas.
But I know you’ll do the best you can	Ichaqa yachanin aswan allin kaqta ruwanaykita
I want it to be at least	Munani aswanpas kananta
No one could do that.	Manam pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqachu.
Otherwise she was no longer alone to him.	Mana chayqa manañan sapallanchu karqan paypaq.
That was supposed to be funny.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam kanan karqa.
I may not be able to do that	Manapaschá chayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I have said this over and over again.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim nirqani.
I can’t say what it is	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmanta
I am feeling much better now	Kunanqa ancha allinmi kachkani
And then again and again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta yapamanta.
I’ll do that again.	Chaytaqa yapamanta ruwasaq.
I think she needs him	Yuyaykuni payta necesitasqanmanta
He is not a bad guy.	Payqa manam millay runachu.
I was fine, too.	Ñuqapas allinmi karqani.
I could never figure that out	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
One sounds good.	Hukninmi allinta uyarikun.
I had no idea you were in town	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani llaqtapi kasqaykita
I think it would have been	Chayna kanman karqa nispam piensani
The other one.	Huknin.
I thought it would be bad	Yuyarqanim mana allinchu kananmanta
They were all right.	Allinmi karqaku.
I can't speak immediately	Manam chaylla rimayta atinichu
I just thought it would be nice	Chayllaraqmi yuyaykurqani sumaq kanman nispa
He thought he would be alone.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi sapallan kananta.
She knew exactly what he was thinking.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima piensasqanmanta.
First, there was the dress.	Ñawpaqtaqa, chaypiqa karqan p’acha.
I’m not sure why it’s so important to him.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa paypaq ancha importante kasqanmanta.
I saw that now	Chaytaqa kunanmi rikurqani
I really want to work	Anchatan munani llank’ayta
I knew this very well	Kaytaqa allintam yacharqani
That and then there.	Chay chaymanta chaypi.
I couldn't help it, he was right	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu, payqa allintam niwarqa
It’s bigger, bigger, bigger.	Aswan hatunmi, aswan hatunmi, aswan hatunmi.
He couldn't really play.	Payqa manam chiqaptaqa pukllayta atirqachu.
I wouldn’t be guilty	Manam huchayoq hinachu kayman
But I knew there was more to it than that	Ichaqa yacharqanim chaymanta aswan achka kasqanmanta
I haven't seen anything like that in so long	Chayna unayñam mana chaynata rikurqanichu
He goes again.	Yapamanta rin.
I’m serious about this	Kaymantaqa serio kani
The sooner the better.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin.
I feel the same way, as I do	Ñuqapas chaynatam sientekuni, ñuqa hina
I need some money.	Wakin qullqita necesitasaq.
She knew he was scared.	Payqa yacharqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
I know what this is.	Yachanim ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
He thought he was a tough kid.	Sinchi wawa kasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
Instead, I was a little surprised	Aswanpas huk chhikantan admirakurqani
Nothing is certain.	Manan imapas segurochu.
I want to sleep now	Kunanqa puñuyta munani
I can’t remember what happened	Manam yuyariyta atinichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
I had no idea who was there	Manam yuyaykurqanichu pikuna chaypi kasqankuta
But it was clear what he meant.	Ichaqa sut’inmi karqan imachus nisqanmanta.
All very human.	Tukuy ancha runa.
Actually you know better.	Chiqaptaqa qamqa aswan allintam yachanki.
He was pretty sure of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqa.
I had never been there before	Manam haykapipas chaymanqa rirqanichu
He was the one who didn’t.	Paymi karqan mana.
I need something, man	Imatapas necesitasaq, runa
I’m right there too.	Ñuqapas allintam chaypiqa kani.
He didn’t say anything.	Payqa manan nirqanchu.
I just wasn’t sure what happened to cause it	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imachus chayta ruwananpaq pasasqanmanta
I knew it probably was	Yacharqanim yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta
Do it a couple of times.	Huk iskay kutita ruway.
I thought that was a good thing	Chayqa allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
But I may not need one.	Ichaqa manapaschá hukta necesitasaqchu.
I didn’t want him to be alone	Manam munarqanichu sapallan kananta
I am happier every day	Sapa punchawmi astawan kusisqa tarikuni
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa qanmi ruwanayki.
I think you have to do that	Chayta ruwanayki tiyan, nispa yuyani
What is the best thing.	Imataq aswan allinqa.
There is indeed.	Chiqamanta kan.
I don't see the problem with this	Manam rikunichu kaymanta ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta
I know the consequences	Yachanim chaymanta imakuna pasananta
I wasn’t quite ready for that	Chaypaqqa manan allintachu listo karqani
So much to go home to.	Ancha achkata wasiyman rinaypaq.
The night is good.	Tutaqa allinmi.
I’m lucky he didn’t.	Suerteyoqmi kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wasn’t quite sure why	Manam allintachu yacharqani imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
I would have that tomorrow	Chaytaqa paqarinmi kanman
I just couldn’t speak	Chaylla mana rimayta atirqanichu
I do the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaytam ruwani.
I knew it was going to be bad	Yacharqanim mana allin kananta
And today was that day.	Hinaspa kunan punchaw chay punchaw karqa.
I don’t know if it’s going to be tonight.	Mana yachanichu kunan tuta kananta.
I’m a housewife	Wasi runa kani
Maybe I’ll be somewhere	Ichapas ñuqapas maypipas kasaq
I didn’t listen to him much.	Manam anchatachu paytaqa uyarirqani.
I think that’s what I want	Yuyaykuni chay munasqayta
I think that’s a pretty big deal	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi nispan yuyaykuni
I wanted to know, too	Ñoqapas yachayta munarqani
Whether he can support it is what really matters.	Chayta yanapayta atinmanchu icha manachu chaytam aswan allinqa.
I’ll probably never be able to eat again.	Yaqapaschá manaña hayk’aqpas mikhuyta atisaqchu.
I like it, too.	Ñuqapas gustanmi.
Conduct.	Allin kay.
I couldn’t wait to be alone	Manam suyayta atirqanichu sapallay kanaypaq
I still don’t know.	Kunankamaqa manam yachanichu.
I knew he was devastated	Yacharqanim sinchi hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
But that was not the case, neither there nor here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, manan chaypichu nitaq kaypichu.
I really should have done that	Chiqaptam chayta ruwanay karqa
Yes, everything was fine.	Arí, tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He always knows.	Payqa sapa kutim yachan.
He was, you know.	Payqa karqan, yachanki.
He’s very good about it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaymanta.
He came out very happy.	Ancha kusisqa lluqsirqa.
This is a very bad thing.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi.
Now I am the only one.	Kunanqa ñuqallam kachkani.
For now, there is nothing we can do.	Kunankamaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
I didn’t know there was someone else here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi huk runa kasqanmanta
He wasn’t happy being married, you know.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kasharqan casarasqa kasqanmanta, chaytan yachanki.
He didn’t know what was wrong with him.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus paywan kashasqanmanta.
It’s amazing how wrong this is.	Admirakuypaqmi kayqa ancha pantasqa kasqanmanta.
He looked sad, guilty, and a little nervous.	Payqa llakisqa, huchayoq, huk chhikanta mancharisqa ima qhawarisqa.
I just didn’t see it	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder where he is	Maypi kasqanmantam tapukuni
I thought you were the smart one	Yuyarqanim qam chay yachaysapa kasqaykita
I didn’t know what was in it	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta
I was right, she was really nice	Allintam nirqani, payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa
I have no idea where it is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi kasqanmanta.
I thought no one would know what it was	Yuyarqanim mana pipas yachananta ima kasqanmanta
Now that's up to him.	Kunanqa chaymi paymanta kanqa.
I wasn’t sure why he felt so bad right away	Manam segurochu karqani imanasqataq chay rato mana allin sientekusqanmanta
I wanted to know more about him.	Paymanta astawan yachayta munarqani.
Not doing it for any reason is wrong.	Imaraykupas mana ruwayqa mana allinchu.
Hopefully it will be okay.	Munaymanmi allin kananpaq.
It’s not there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu kachkan.
It just sort of does it	Chaylla huk laya ruwan
I knew it, too.	Ñuqapas yacharqanim.
You can't justify that.	Manam chaytaqa allinpaq hapiyta atiwaqchu.
I always thought he was a great guy	Sapa kutim piensarqani hatun runa kananpaq
Don't be so stupid and unattractive.	Ama chayna sonso hinaspa mana sumaq rikchayniyuq kaychu.
No, he certainly did things.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin payqa imakunatapas ruwarqan.
To win again.	Hukmanta atipananpaq.
I just couldn’t do anything about it	Chaylla mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
I know exactly where it is	Maypi kasqanmanta allinta yachani
The angry man was injured	Chay phiñasqa runa k’irisqa karqan
And that’s the other one.	Hinaspa chay huknin.
Yes, he could not buy it.	Arí, manam rantiyta atirqachu.
What would the baby be like? 	¿Imaynataq kanman chay wawa?
One day you will find out.	Huk punchawmi qampas chaytaqa yachanki.
But that was before.	Ichaqa chayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
He said, yes, indeed.	Payqa nisqa, arí, chiqaptam.
I doubt that’s half of it	Iskayrayani chay kuskan kasqanmanta
I couldn't stay out for long	Manam unaytachu lluqsiyta atiyman karqa
It’s hard to do this.	Sasa kay ruway.
I can't remember a time when it happened	Manam yuyariyta atinichu huk tiempota, chay pasasqanmantaqa
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Ichapas allin, ichapas mana allin.
I didn’t think to ask	Manam tapuyta yuyaykurqanichu
Maybe that was too hard.	Ichapas chayqa llumpay sinchi karqa.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa sichus munanki chayqa.
It was too cold.	Chayqa llumpay chiri karqa.
Eventually maybe, but not yet.	Qhepamanmi ichapas, ichaqa manaraqmi.
But I couldn’t figure out what was so funny	Ichaqa manan yachayta atirqanichu imachus ancha asikunapaq kasqanmanta
Everything looks great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
And you know what.	Hinaspa yachankichu.
It’s not ready yet.	Manaraqmi listochu kachkan.
I was the lowest of the low	Ñoqaqa aswan pisi kaqmi karqani
I didn’t know how to tell it	Manam yacharqanichu imayna willayta
There he thought for a long time.	Chaypin unayta allinta yuyaykurqan.
But it was very large.	Ichaqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
I can’t ride a bike	Manam bicicletapi puriyta atinichu
I thought of him as such.	Paytaqa chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I am very, very happy	Ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani
I knew who this guy was	Ñoqaqa yacharqanim pi kay runa kasqanmanta
He realized he knew nothing about her.	Payqa repararqanmi paymanta mana imatapas yachasqanmanta.
He caught on to it quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan chayta hap’irqan.
I’ve seen it many times	Askha kutitan chaytaqa rikurqani
I’m not sure, but maybe.	Manam segurochu kani, ichaqa ichapas.
He was always there alone.	Payqa sapa kutim sapallan chaypi karqa.
That was always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim karqa.
I want to be that sure.	Chayna seguro kaytam munani.
If not, it would be fine	Mana chayna kaptinqa, allinmi kanman
Obviously, he agreed.	Sut’inmi, payqa arí nisqa.
I thought it would be hard for you.	Yuyarqanim sasa kanman qampaq.
I wanted to be him again	Hukmanta pay kayta munarqani
This was a good thing for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi karqa kayqa.
I’m not here right now.	Manam kunanqa kaypichu kachkani.
I know you do too.	Ñoqaqa yachanim qampas chayta ruwasqaykita.
I never expected that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa suyarqanichu
It makes the job better.	Llamk’ayta aswan allinta ruwan.
I thought it was more interesting	Aswan sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I do know that though	Chaytaqa yachanim ichaqa
I really wanted to do that	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwayta munarqani
I didn’t want to hear it again	Manam hukmanta uyariyta munarqanichu
Now I know it's wrong.	Kunanqa yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
But I didn’t think it would be like tonight	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu kunan tuta hina kananta
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Manam segurochu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I have no idea how to do that.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna chayta ruwanaypaq.
I want it to be quick	Utqaylla kananta munani
We did some work there.	Chaypin wakin llank’ayta ruwarqayku.
Nothing good to do.	Mana ima allinta ruwanapaq.
I know getting fired is really hard	Yachanim qarqusqa kayqa chiqap sasa kasqanmanta
I knew it would happen one day	Yacharqanim huk punchaw chayna kananta
I know exactly where you are	Ñoqaqa allintam yachani maypi kasqaykita
I know how to play it	Chayta pukllayta yachani
The one like me.	Ñoqa hina kaq.
All so fast.	Tukuy chayna utqaylla.
Now he was tired and hungry.	Kunanqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima kasqa.
I really wanted to think about it	Anchatam chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqani
He knew who he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi pi kasqanmanta.
The sooner the better, really.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin, chiqap.
No one ever noticed anything.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas imatapas repararqanchu.
I knew how to handle them	Chaykunataqa allintam yacharqani imayna manejayta
But it may not be working properly.	Ichaqa manapaschá allintachu llank’ashan.
We are so proud of you.	Anchatam orgulloso kayku qammanta.
I can’t stay in the city	Manan llaqtapi qhepakuyta atiymanchu
He's not a bad guy, really.	Payqa manam millay runachu, chiqaptaqa.
I want to know what it is	Ima kasqanmanta yachayta munani
That doesn't mean he's right.	Chaywanqa manam allintachu rimachkan.
Then sometimes.	Chaymanta wakin kuti.
Really nice performance	Chiqap sumaq ruway
I didn’t think much of this before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan anchatachu kaypi yuyaykurqani
If there really isn't anyone else.	Sichus chiqaptapuni mana huk runa kaptinqa.
He really wanted to work.	Payqa anchatam llamkayta munarqa.
We did things together.	Kuska imatapas ruwarqayku.
I'll be fine	Allinmi kasaq
I wish I could go there soon.	Munaymanmi chayman riyta chaylla.
I’m the only one who knows.	Ñuqallam yachani.
I couldn’t stop talking	Manam rimayta saqiyta atirqanichu
That was obvious to him now.	Chayqa kunanqa sut’inmi karqan paypaq.
I don’t need those things.	Manam chaykunataqa necesitasaqchu.
I didn’t think it would work	Manam piensarqanichu allin kananta
I was like a wounded man	Ñoqaqa k’irisqa runa hinan karqani
I didn’t know that was the case	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
And a year.	Hinaspa huk wata.
Maybe as many as ten.	Ichapas chunka hina.
I'm a beautiful person.	Sumaqmi kani.
I had no idea you were married to him	Manam yuyaykurqanichu paywan casarasqa kasqaykita
I want to be a better person	Aswan allin runa kaytam munani
I want to talk about this	Kaymanta rimayta munani
He looked hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa qhawarisqa.
I mean really really badly.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta mana allinta niyta munani.
I didn’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yacharqani.
I know everything will be fine	Yachanim tukuy imapas allin kananta
I had a different idea	Huk chikan yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I want to work for a while	Huk rato llamkayta munani
I seriously doubt he will	Sinchitan iskayrayani chayta ruwananta
I’ve wanted to be a teacher for a long time	Unayñan huk yachachiq kayta munarqani
I wasn’t sure at first.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan segurochu karqani.
He was glad he didn’t have to.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan mana ruwanan kasqanmanta.
I still couldn't figure it out	Kunankamapas manam yachayta atirqanichu
But there is a way to avoid this.	Ichaqa kanmi imayna mana chayna kananpaq.
You know, seriously.	Yachanki, serio.
I recently did a story about him	Chayllaraqmi paymanta huk willakuyta ruwarqani
I wish this was me	Munayman karqan ñoqa kayqa
Better now.	Aswan allin kunan.
Now I did it.	Kunanqa ruwarqani.
We are not ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manam listochu kachkaniku.
I didn’t want to do anything	Manam ima ruwaytapas munarqanichu
He never intended to live with her	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas paywan tiyayta yuyaykurqanchu
I haven’t seen him yet	Manaraqmi paytaqa rikurqanichu
It’s never been as true as it is now.	Manan hayk’aqpas kunan hina cheqaqchu karqan.
This was here, now.	Kayqa kaypim karqa, kunanqa.
I wouldn't disagree with that	Chaywanqa manam mana acuerdopichu kayman
I knew something was seriously wrong	Yacharqanim imapas hatun mana allin kasqanmanta
It’s like it should be.	Imayna kanan hinam.
I think about it every night and day.	Chaypin sapa tuta p’unchay yuyaykuni.
He seems to be in shock.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
I’ve seen that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi rikurqani.
I was sure something bad had happened	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin pasasqanmanta
I was truly surprised	Cheqaqtapunin admirakurqani
I feel so lucky that way.	Chay hinaqa ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni.
This should be easy.	Kayqa facilmi kanan.
Nothing like that here.	Mana imapas chayna kaypi.
That was a wonderful experience for me.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa ñuqapaq.
It wasn't set up very well.	Manam ancha allintachu churasqa karqa.
They all live there.	Chaypim llapallanku yachanku.
Otherwise, nothing is wrong.	Mana chayqa, mana imapas mana allinchu.
I’ve seen it many times before	Ñawpaqtaqa askha kutitan rikurqani
He didn’t know how.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta.
I had heard of them, but not really listened to them	Chaykunataqa uyarirqanim, ichaqa manam chiqaptachu uyarirqani
You will be happier and happier.	Aswan kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam kanki.
I can’t wait to go to school	Manam suyayta atinichu yachay wasiman riyta
I think he’s worried.	Yuyaykuni llakisqa kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t want that to be as bad as it once was.	Manam munarqanichu chay huk kuti hina mana allin kananta.
I couldn’t figure out how and why	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imayna hinaspa imanasqa kasqanmanta
Worst time perhaps.	Aswan mana allin pacha ichapas.
You know you can’t.	Yachanki mana atisqaykita.
Great man, good man	Hatun runa, allin runa
So, if nothing else.	Chaymi, mana imapas huk kaptinqa.
I feel sure he will do well.	Seguro sientekuni allinta ruwananta.
But there is something you can do.	Ichaqa kanmi imatapas ruwanaykipaq.
I fear a terrible and	Manchakuni huk manchay hinaspa
It sounds crazy.	Loco hinam uyarikun.
I’m not too sure	Manam anchatachu seguro kani
But that is not the case now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa allinchu chayqa.
I hope no one gets hurt	Suyachkani mana pipas k’irisqa kananta
You look familiar.	Riqsisqa rikchakunki.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu.
I still think positively	Kunankamapas allintam piensani
And that was a very difficult thing to do.	Hinaspa chaymi ancha sasa ruwayqa karqa.
People want a lot of it.	Runakunaqa achkatam munanku.
I couldn’t think ahead	Manam ñawpaqpi yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
If you want to try something new.	Imatapas musuq kaqta ruwayta munaspaqa.
I can’t remember now	Manam kunanqa yuyariyta atinichu
You can't work.	Manam llamkayta atiwaqchu.
Let’s hope that’s what you want.	Suyasun chayta munasqaykita.
I know it can’t be me	Yachanim mana ñuqa kayta atiymanchu
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.
But I know what happened	Ichaqa yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
A real chance almost	Huk chiqap chansa yaqa
That obviously won’t work.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu kanqa.
I mean, it was just that	Niyta munani, chaylla karqa
I hope you are okay and not mad at me	Suyachkani allin kasqaykita hinaspa mana ñuqawan phiñasqa kasqaykita
I’m not sure though.	Manam segurochu kani ichaqa.
You know you can do the job.	Yachankim chay llamkayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
He's out here.	Payqa kaypi hawapi kachkan.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta munanichu.
So that’s a very good thing.	Chaymi chayqa ancha allin.
I am doing that right now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwachkani.
I know there are two ways to do this	Yachanim iskay ruway kasqanmanta kayta ruwanapaq
I thought it didn't matter	Manam imananpaschu kasqanmantam piensarqani
I still don't believe it happened.	Kunankamapas manam creenichu chayna kasqanmanta.
Nothing is the same as before.	Mana imapas ñawpaq hinachu.
So, however, it will be difficult.	Chaymi ichaqa sasa kanqa.
Then again, that’s all there is to it.	Chaymanta yapamanta, chaylla kachkan.
Please tell me what to do.	Ama hina kaspa willaway imatachus ruwanaykita.
The first one did it.	Ñawpaq kaqmi chayta ruwarqa.
If you do, proceed to the next step.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, qatiqnin ruwayman riy.
I can’t find it either	Ñuqapas manam tarinichu
He still can't walk.	Kunankamapas manam puriyta atinchu.
I wanted to talk to him	Paywan rimayta munarqani
I wanted to be the first	Ñawpaq kaq kaytam munarqani
A few days, maybe more	Iskay kimsa punchaw, ichapas aswan achkata
It’s not like the night before.	Manan ñawpaq tutan hinachu.
I was ready for something	Imapas ruwanaypaqmi listoña karqani
I know how hard it is	Yachanim imayna sinchi sasa kasqanmanta
I wasn’t at all sure it was	Manam ni imapipas segurochu karqani chayna kasqanmanta
Actually, it doesn’t.	Chiqaptaqa, manam.
I couldn't get out of here fast enough	Manam kaymanta utqaylla lluqsiyta atirqanichu
He’s just bigger than that.	Payqa chaylla aswan hatunmi.
He doesn’t know exactly where he is.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan maypi kashasqanmanta.
I didn't think much of this	Kaypiqa manam anchatachu piensarqani
You’re doing it, you’re doing it right.	Ruwachkanki, allintam ruwachkanki.
I didn’t think you would actually do it	Manam piensarqanichu chiqaptapuni ruwanaykita
I didn’t really want a car anyway	Manam anchatachu munarqani imayna kaptinpas huk carrota
Of this I am certain.	Kaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
You know, how do you do that? 	Yachanki, ¿imaynatataq chayta ruwanki?
Not sure why though.	Mana segurochu imarayku ichaqa.
I’m glad it was true at the time	Kusikuni chay tiempopi cheqaq kasqanmanta
This is where he should be.	Kaypim payqa kanan.
He says no, everything is fine.	Payqa manan, tukuy imapas allinmi nin.
I think that's pretty interesting	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi nispam piensani
He is a very wicked man.	Payqa ancha millay runa.
And he began to work.	Hinaspa llamkayta qallaykurqa.
I want something.	Imatapas munani.
I didn’t want to drive	Manam carrota manejayta munarqanichu
I couldn’t seem to stop it	Manapaschá hark’ayta atirqanichu hina
But no, he wanted to play with me.	Ichaqa manam, ñuqawan pukllayta munarqa.
But nothing like that.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinaqa.
He continued to go.	Hinallam rirqa.
I don't know what's worse	Manam yachanichu ima aswan mana allin kasqanmantaqa
People seemed very happy for some reason.	Runakunaqa imaraykupas ancha kusisqa hinam karqaku.
This is a big time for me	Kayqa hatun pacha ñuqapaq
It was awfully difficult.	Ancha millay sasa karqa.
I really have no idea what to do for him	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu kani imatachus paypaq ruwanay tiyan
I thought someone was sick.	Pipas unqusqa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
This is more about me.	Kayqa aswan ñuqamanta kaqmi.
I was the only one there.	Ñuqallam chaypiqa karqani.
I hope to be there more often	Suyachkani aswan sapa kuti chaypi kayta
That was the most important thing.	Chayqa aswan importante kaqmi karqan.
I’m better when he’s with me	Paywan kaptinqa aswan allinmi kani
I didn’t want to do anything wrong	Manam ima mana allin ruwaytapas munarqanichu
I know better than I do.	Aswan allintam yachani.
Everyone was tired and frustrated.	Lliwmi sayk’usqa, hukmanyasqa ima karqanku.
I hope today was better	Suyachkani kunan punchaw aswan allin kasqanmanta
It’s like learning a language as an adult.	Kuraq runa kaspa huk simita yachay hinam.
I want to see him	Payta rikuyta munani
It’s just something .	Chayqa imapas chaylla .
He knows how hard it is for you.	Payqa yachanmi qanpaq sasa kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t remember his name.	Manam sutinta yuyariyta atirqanichu.
He knows he’s doing the right thing.	Payqa yachanmi allin ruwasqanmanta.
I want to know if it’s right or not.	Allinchu icha manachu chayta yachayta munani.
But no one could find him there.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaypi tariyta atirqanchu.
If so, proceed to the next step.	Chayna kaptinqa qatiqnin ruwayman riy.
He was very nice to her.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi paywan karqa.
There is a factual truth here.	Kaypiqa kanmi chiqap kaq chiqap.
You want her to be happy.	Munanki kusisqa kananta.
If it’s not too bad.	Mana ancha mana allin kaptinqa.
Okay, maybe every week.	Allinmi, ichapas sapa semana.
It sounds good.	Allinmi uyarikun.
I want to make sure it's good	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kayta munani
We are so happy that he did!.	¡Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku chay ruwasqanmanta!.
He wouldn’t do it, you know.	Manam ruwanmanchu, yachanki.
I didn’t see much of him	Manam anchatachu paytaqa rikurqani
I didn’t want to come here	Manam kayman hamuyta munarqanichu
I didn't know why he wanted to see it	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa qawayta munasqanmanta
The younger one spoke first.	Sullk’a kaqmi ñawpaqta rimarqan.
I thought so a while ago	Huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi chaynata piensarqani
I couldn’t get away with it.	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
That’s what you had to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki karqan.
It just wasn’t there.	Chayllam mana karqachu.
I want to remember what it was like.	Imayna kasqanmantam yuyariyta munani.
I have no reason to support him	Manam imaraykupas payta yanapanaypaq kanchu
We can’t stop it.	Manam harkayta atichwanchu.
He can’t overcome that.	Mana chayta atipayta atinchu.
And that will make for a better movie.	Hinaspa chaymi aswan allin peliculata ruwanqa.
That was two years ago.	Chayqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Now I am happy to be here with him	Kunanqa kusisqam kachkani kaypi paywan kasqaymanta
He was the first to do so.	Paymi puntata chayta ruwarqa.
I think that’s what you want	Yuyaykuni chaynata munasqaykita
I’m going to do the same thing	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwasaq
I could sit here all day	Tukuy punchawmi kaypi tiyayta atiyman
I couldn’t bear to be alone	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu sapallay kayta
I wanted to find him.	Payta tariyta munarqani.
He is such a wonderful person.	Payqa chhayna sumaq runan.
I catch it fairly quickly.	Allin utqayllam hapini.
I'm not that happy about it	Manam chayna kusisqachu kani chaymantaqa
I could have done a lot worse	Aswan mana allintam ruwayta atiyman karqa
I haven’t seen him yet	Manaraqmi paytaqa rikunichu
Your very favorite child	Anchata munasqayki wawa
I still have no idea where it went	Kunankamapas manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani mayman risqanmanta
That was a good thing for him.	Chayqa allinmi karqa paypaq.
I don’t know who was more scared, me or that.	Mana yachanichu pichus aswan mancharisqa karqa, ñuqa utaq chay.
Now you have the most important thing to do.	Kunanqa aswan importante ruwanayki kashan.
I never knew what happened with it	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chaywan ima pasasqanmantaqa
And then, it happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chayna pasarqa.
This is never easy.	Kayqa manam haykapipas facilchu.
I knew what needed to be done	Yacharqanim imakuna ruwana kasqanmanta
A young man, really.	Huk wayna, chiqaptapuni.
That’s probably a good thing	Chayqa yaqapaschá allin kasqanmanta
This thing is pretty easy.	Kay imapas ancha facilmi.
You don’t know if you don’t.	Mana yachankichu icha manachu chayta.
I knew they were scared	Yacharqanim mancharisqa kasqankuta
I don't remember where he lived.	Manam yuyarinichu maypi tiyasqanmanta.
We’re wrong.	Pantasqa kayku.
He’s got this.	Payqa kaytan hap’irqan.
It’s not like that.	Manan hinachu.
Then a week later.	Chaymanta huk semana.
I was there the whole time	Chaypin tukuy tiempo karqani
I doubt what the truth is	Iskayrayani ima chiqap kasqanmanta
I still wonder why he didn't	Hinallam tapukuni imanasqataq mana chayna ruwasqanmanta
He makes it about being here.	Payqa kaypi kasqanmantam ruwan.
About a year.	Yaqa huk wata.
Everyone wants more.	Lliwmi aswan achkata munanku.
Everything is beautiful there.	Chaypiqa tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
I wanted to be alone	Sapallan kaytam munarqani
I can’t go to school	Manam yachay wasiman riyta atinichu
I didn’t want you to be disappointed	Manam munarqanichu hukmanyasqa kanaykita
Sure enough, he said.	Seguro, nispas nisqa.
I wish it could be me	Munaymanmi ñuqa kayman
This looks very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Be happy when you’re alone.	Sapallan kaspa kusisqa kay.
Cold now, but almost pleasantly cold.	Kunanqa chiri, ichaqa yaqa sumaq chiri.
I couldn’t get away with it	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atirqanichu
I just have it for you though	Ñuqaqa chayllaraqmi qampaq kachkan ichaqa
Twice that much.	Iskay kuti chay achka.
If so, you should do the same.	Chayna kaptinqa, qampas chaynatam ruwanayki.
If that happens again.	Sichus hukmanta chhayna kanman chayqa.
I am so happy to have you.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani qamwan kasqaymanta.
He couldn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.
I actually had no idea he was here	Chiqaptaqa manam piensarqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta
I can’t be sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kayman
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa kasqa.
But he was right.	Ichaqa allintan chaytaqa nirqan.
Unfortunately, he suffered an injury late in the season.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa huk k'irisqa karqan chay pacha tukukuypi.
I wasn’t always an adult	Manam sapa kutichu kuraq runa karqani
Tell me about him.	Paymanta willaway.
Of course, you never know when it will happen.	Arí, manam haykapipas yachankichu haykapi chayna pasananta.
He doesn’t have to do it alone.	Manam sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwanan.
But I couldn’t find that one answer	Ichaqa manan chay huk kutichiyta tariyta atirqanichu
I didn't think it was of any use to me.	Manam piensarqanichu imapaqpas ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
Now he wasn’t so sure.	Kunanqa manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.
You are or you are not.	Qamqa kanki icha mana.
Now, you do it.	Kunanqa, qanmi ruwanki.
Which is the truth.	Imataq chiqap kaq.
They were never like that.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqanku.
All terribly familiar.	Tukuy manchay riqsisqa.
I still really worry about that.	Chaymantaqa kunankamapas chiqaptam llakikuni.
I probably couldn’t anyway	Manachá imayna kaptinpas atirqanichu
Much more than you.	Qammanta aswan achka.
Then he did it.	Chaymantam chayta ruwarqa.
I can’t do that to him	Manam paytaqa chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
I knew he was going, that's all	Yacharqanim risqanmanta, chayllam
I heard that over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim uyarirqani.
No one could ever be the first.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas ñawpaq kaq kayta atinmanchu karqan.
I don't mean anything by that	Chaywanqa manam imatapas niyta munanichu
I couldn’t deal with it all any other way	Manam huk hinaqa tukuy chaykunataqa atipayta atirqanichu
He was there for about an hour.	Huk hora hinam chaypi karqa.
I have no idea what this is about.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imamantataq kayqa rimachkan.
That’s what he’s doing.	Chaytan payqa ruwashan.
Everything was easy.	Tukuy imapas facilmi karqa.
That happened all the time.	Chayqa sapa kutim pasarqa.
I know where you live, after all	Yachanim maypi yachasqaykita, tukuy imamanta
I haven’t noticed it yet	Manam kunankamapas repararqanichu
Half of anything.	Imamantapas kuskan.
Must be thirty years ago.	Kimsa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi kanan.
I had no idea how long it would last	Manam yuyaykurqanichu hayka tiempo chayna kananta
I knew he was happy	Yacharqanim kusisqa kasqanmanta
I think that is wrong	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani
He was a good speaker.	Paymi allinta rimaq karqan.
It just wasn’t difficult.	Chaylla mana sasachu karqa.
What did he do.	Imatataq ruwarqa.
I said this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytam nirqani.
In many cases, this difficult statement is appropriate.	Achka kutipi kay sasa rimayqa allinmi.
He said this, she said that.	Payqa kayta nisqa, paymi chayta nisqa.
Everything, then.	Tukuy, chaymanta.
I feel like this is my time now	Kunanqa kay tiempoy hinam tarikuni
I think it looks good	Allinmi rikchakun nispam piensani
Nothing had gone wrong yet.	Manaraqmi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
But I do know that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa yachanin.
He doesn’t seem overly concerned.	Payqa manan llumpay llakisqa hinachu.
I plan to find out what that is	Chayqa ima kasqanmanta yachayta yuyaykuni
Now, everyone can do better.	Kunanqa, llapa runan aswan allinta ruwayta atinman.
I feel like a new person	Musuq runa hinam tarikuni
I'm sure it's better for him.	Seguro kani paypaq aswan allin kasqanmanta.
Now I couldn’t bear another word	Kunanqa manan huk rimayta aguantayta atirqanichu
I was busy this morning too	Ñuqapas kunan paqarinmi ocupasqa karqani
You are doing so much for me here.	Kaypiqa anchatam ñuqapaq ruwachkanki.
I'm doing something wrong.	Mana allintam ruwachkani.
I can’t believe you do that every night	Mana creeyta atiymanchu sapa tuta chayta ruwasqaykita
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa karqan.
I know what works for you	Yachanim imakuna qampaq allin kasqanmanta
I’m glad he did	Kusikuni chay ruwasqanmanta
I wonder where he was last night	Qayna tuta maypi kasqanmanta tapukuni
I think you can deal with this	Kayta atipayta atisqaykita yuyani
You are so much of it.	Qamqa anchatam chaymantaqa kanki.
That’s what he does best.	Chaytan payqa aswan allinta ruwan.
I couldn’t cope anymore	Manañam atipayta atirqanichu
I wanted to be here	Kaypi kaytam munarqani
I think someone did something to him.	Yuyaykuni pipas paywan imatapas ruwasqanmanta.
I was so nervous, nervous and excited	Ancha mancharisqa, mancharisqa, kusisqa ima karqani
He seems happy there.	Chaypiqa kusisqa hinam kachkan.
It doesn’t mean it’s good.	Manam niyta munanchu allin kasqanmantaqa.
He knew he had to act quickly.	Payqa yacharqanmi usqhaylla imatapas ruwananta.
A very strange evening, this was	Ancha mana riqsisqa ch’isi, kayqa karqan
He’s a solo player.	Payqa sapallan pukllaqmi.
One of them has to go	Hukninmi rinan
I can't stand it, you have no idea	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu, manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki
So, that means it.	Chaymi, chayqa niyta munan.
I know what happened there	Yachanim chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta
I can’t get anyone	Manam pitapas hapiyta atiymanchu
You are the only one there.	Chaypiqa qamllam kachkanki.
I don’t feel comfortable	Manam allinchu tarikuni
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanman.
I just don’t know what to say.	Chaylla mana yachanichu ima niyta.
That was always the real me.	Chayqa sapa kutim chiqap ñuqa karqani.
I’m afraid that’s not the case	Manchakuni mana chayna kasqanmanta
I don’t want that to happen to you	Manam munanichu qamwan chayna pasananta
But that is not the only way to do it.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu chay ruwayqa.
I was just, you know	Ñuqaqa karqani chaylla, yachanki
I was really busy	Chiqaptam ocupasqa karqani
There are.	Kan.
He did, however, do so.	Paymi ichaqa chayta ruwarqan.
I hope it won't be too late	Suyachkani mana ancha tarde kananta
I was very, very confused	Ancha, ancha pantasqa karqani
You can do that right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwawaq.
That means he is.	Chayqa paymi niyta munan.
The really important thing.	Chiqap importante kaq.
I think that’s a wonderful thing to do.	Chayqa ancha sumaq ruwaymi nispan yuyaykuni.
I think he wants to talk to you	Yuyaykuni qanwan rimayta munasqanmanta
I have always been a loner	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi sapallay runa karqani
I know, right?	Yachanim, ¿aw.
I don't know when that happened	Manam yachanichu haykapi chay pasasqanmantaqa
He really is something.	Payqa chiqaptam imapas.
I hope, you are very happy here.	Suyachkani, kaypi ancha kusisqa kasqaykita.
It gave me an opportunity to help.	Chayqa huk oportunidadta quwarqa yanapanaypaq.
I was really happy and excited about it.	Chiqaptam kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa karqani chaymanta.
And that he wasn't alone.	Hinaspa mana sapallan kasqanmanta.
That’s probably what you need to do.	Chayqa yaqapaschá ruwanayki kanqa.
But he's still not sure what's wrong with that.	Ichaqa kunankamapas manan segurochu kashan imachus chaymanta mana allin kasqanmanta.
I mean for the first time	Ñawpaq kutita niyta munani
Like late at night.	Tuta tarde hina.
Even if it wasn’t, maybe it would have been.	Manaña chayna kaptinpas, ichapas chayna kanman karqa.
Cold cold night.	Chiri chiri tuta.
And then the first year.	Hinaspa chaymanta ñawpaq wata.
A lot of time	Ancha achka tiempo
I know this now.	Kaytaqa kunanmi yachani.
Night after night.	Tutamanta tutamanta.
They will be the best.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
I couldn't bear to watch.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu qawayta.
I can’t stand it, not yet.	Manam aguantayta atinichu, manaraqmi.
He can’t play anymore.	Manañam pukllayta atinchu.
It was two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I didn’t want to do it outside	Manam hawapi ruwayta munarqanichu
In a dressing gown.	Huk p’achapi.
I know how to deal with this	Kayta imayna atipayta yachani
This approach is good on its own	Kay ruwayqa sapallanmi allin
Now I can finally tell you.	Kunanqa tukukuypi willayta atiyman.
I didn’t want him to come back	Manam munarqanichu kutimunanta
I was supposed to be there for two weeks	Iskay semanan chaypi kanay karqan
So this is very important.	Chaymi kayqa ancha allinqa.
You’re going to go home.	Wasiykiman rinki.
I had no idea what happened	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
This, again, is huge.	Kayqa, yapamanta, hatunmi.
He never wanted to talk to me.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ñoqawan rimayta munarqanchu.
Now I could barely see it.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá manaña rikuyta atirqanichu.
I wanted to make sure nothing went wrong	Mana imapas mana allin kananpaqmi seguro kayta munarqani
It's not.	Manachu.
A few days, a few months, maybe a year	Iskay kimsa punchaw, iskay kimsa killa, ichapas huk wata
I know it's not true	Yachanim mana chiqap kasqanmanta
That still seems a little unrealistic.	Chayqa kunankamapas huk chikan mana chiqap hinam kachkan.
He wasn’t up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu kasharqan.
As much as he can.	Atisqanman hina.
He has been an adult for a long time.	Payqa unayñan kuraq runa kashan.
I couldn't have said another word	Manam huk simitaqa niyta atiymanchu karqa
He learned a language.	Huk simita yacharqan.
I didn’t expect to talk to him	Manam suyarqanichu paywan rimayta
Unfortunately, he was right.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa allintam nirqa.
They are there at the moment.	Paykunaqa kunan pacha chaypi kachkanku.
Most people, however.	Yaqa llapan runakunam ichaqa.
I really don’t know what to do	Cheqaqtapunin mana yachanichu imatachus ruwanayta
No one said that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa nirqanchu.
Second, it makes no sense.	Iskay kaq, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
Now you do it yourself.	Kunanqa qanmi ruwanki.
Again man, it was such a time.	Yapamanta runa, chayna pacha karqa.
I cannot say that now	Kunanqa manam chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu
I don't remember anything about this	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas yuyarinichu
Here’s what it says.	Kaypim nisqa.
He said as much as he could.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinam nirqa.
They know you’re there.	Paykunaqa yachanku chaypi kasqaykita.
I always wanted to know more	Sapa kutim astawan yachayta munarqani
I mean, no one is here	Niyta munani, manam pipas kaypichu kachkan
I really wanted to go with him	Cheqaqtapunin paywan riyta munarqani
Maybe it’s for the best.	Ichapas allinpaq kanman.
But I didn’t expect him to be gone for so long	Ichaqa manan suyarqanichu chay hina unayta manaña kananta
I wanted to leave quickly	Usqhaylla ripuyta munarqani
About me, this time.	Ñoqamanta, kay kutipi.
In fact, the result is good.	Chiqaptaqa, chay ruwasqanqa allinmi.
In fact, this person is nowhere to be found.	Chiqaptaqa kay runaqa manam maypipas kanchu.
I never knew why	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
It won’t be that difficult.	Manam chayna sasachu kanqa.
But I didn’t want that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanichu
Everyone will come along fine.	Lliwmi allinta hamunqa.
It never made sense until now	Manam haykapipas kunankamaqa imapaqpas karqachu
I know they are out here	Yachanim kay hawapi kasqankuta
I know this is going to be hard but do this	Yachanim kayqa sasa kanqa ichaqa kayta ruway
He was worried about her.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan paymanta.
It’s been such a long time.	Chayna unayñam pasarqa.
It was a really bad winter.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin chiri tiempo karqan.
That is not the case here.	Chayqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
I can't imagine why this happened	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imanasqa chayna pasasqanmantaqa
This thing was huge.	Kay imapas hatunmi karqa.
So maybe it’s a good thing.	Chaymi ichapas allin kanman.
I wasn’t sure if he was mad or surprised	Manam segurochu karqani loco kasqanmanta utaq admirasqa kasqanmanta
Now he looked at her.	Kunanqa payta qhawarisqa.
So this is a good one.	Chaymi kayqa allin.
I didn’t hear that word very often	Chay simitaqa manan ancha sapa kutichu uyarirqani
It’s not that I don’t like him or like him	Manam paytaqa mana gustawanchu nitaq gustanchu
I am currently looking for a job	Kunanqa llamkayta maskachkani
He knew it was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
I know what he's going to do	Yachanim ima ruwananta
But then, you can never tell.	Ichaqa chaymanta, mana hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
I knew he thought about it	Yacharqanim chaypi piensasqanmanta
You just have to do it.	Chaylla ruwanayki tiyan.
Obviously that will take time.	Sut’inmi chaypaqqa tiempo kanqa.
He’s the guy.	Paymi chay runa.
I can’t wait for anyone	Manam pitapas suyayta atiymanchu
He didn’t know who this man was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pichus kay runa kasqanmanta.
I know they are there	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta
Thank you people.	Gracias runakuna.
But I never did that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
I didn't do that very well	Chaytaqa manam ancha allintachu ruwarqani
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan karqan.
I didn’t see anything or anyone	Manam imatapas nitaq pitapas rikurqanichu
And that’s why we are.	Hinaspa chayraykum kanchik.
I don’t want anything else.	Manam hukta munanichu.
He hasn’t done that in a long time.	Unayñan mana chaytaqa ruwanchu.
No, they are not good.	Manan, manan allinchu kanku.
It may not be yours.	Manapaschá qanpa hinachu kanman.
He was a little something.	Payqa huk chikan imapas kasqa.
I can’t figure out what it is.	Manam ima kasqanmantaqa yuyaymanayta atinichu.
There's not much anyone can do about it.	Manam anchatachu pipas chaymantaqa ruwayta atinman.
It could be one of them.	Hukninmi kanman.
I didn’t expect that	Manam suyarqanichu chay
I didn’t do well, not really	Manam allintachu ruwarqani, manam chiqaptachu
I’m not going to do that anymore	Manañam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
The best way to say it is no, you don’t have to	Aswan allin rimayqa manan, manan chaytachu ruwanayki
Yes, something must be done.	Arí, imatapas ruwana.
I saw it clearly	Allintam rikurqani
This is not a good practice.	Kayqa manam allin ruwaychu.
It didn't matter anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam imananpaschu karqa.
He knew they were gone but he didn't know where they were.	Payqa yacharqanmi manaña kasqankuta ichaqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
Something sensible happened.	Imapas allin yuyayniyuqmi pasarqa.
The latter is the best.	Chay qhepa kaqmi aswan allinqa.
He didn't want her to do this.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kayta ruwananta.
I don’t want to know	Manam yachayta munanichu
This is the whole process.	Kaymi llapan ruway.
I didn’t always think so	Manam sapa kutichu chaynataqa piensarqani
That will come in handy later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi allin kanqa.
That’s what he did right.	Chaytan allinta ruwarqan.
That may not be easy.	Chayqa manapaschá facilchu kanman.
I want to know more about him too.	Ñuqapas paymanta astawan yachayta munani.
I didn’t really know what happened	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima pasasqanmanta
At least a lot of it.	Aswanpas achka.
I wonder how you found out about it	Tapukuni imaynatataq chaymanta yacharqanki
Now maybe a little busy.	Kunanqa ichapas huk chhikanta ocupasqa kanman.
He probably looks ugly now.	Payqa yaqapaschá kunanqa millay rikch’akun.
I know you did tonight.	Yachanim kunan tuta ruwasqaykita.
I hope it will be.	Suyachkani chayna kananta.
He knows I want him.	Payqa yachanmi munasqayta.
I want every quick fix.	Sapa utqaylla allichayta munani.
And it will have to do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanan kanqa.
Funny how that.	Asikunapaq hina imayna chay.
This will make everything easier!.	Chaywanmi tukuy imapas aswan facil kanqa!.
I never knew what it was like.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
I know exactly how he feels	Allintam yachani imayna sientekusqanmanta
He told me to talk to you anyway.	Paymi niwarqa imayna kaptinpas qanwan rimanaypaq.
I really want to help him	Cheqaqtapunin payta yanapayta munani
I couldn't wait to see what would happen next	Manam suyayta atirqanichu chaymanta imakuna kananmanta qawayta
Again, great performance.	Yapamanta, hatun ruway.
I know they are.	Yachanim kasqankuta.
But I knew it wasn't	Ichaqa yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
I was pleasantly surprised	Kusisqam admirakurqani
I can’t do this	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
It was supposed to be great.	Hatunmi kanan karqa.
That’s a big deal for you.	Chayqa hatunmi qampaq.
There was never any of that.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa karqachu.
Now you are like who you are.	Kunanqa pikuna hinam kanki.
Don’t forget to do this.	Ama qunqaychu kay ruwayta.
However, there is one major difference that will be important to you.	Ichaqa, huk hatun chikan kaymi qampaq ancha allin kanqa.
So he can do that.	Chaymi chayta ruwanman.
I tried really hard.	Ñuqaqa anchatam kallpanchakurqani.
I think about that a lot	Chaymantaqa anchatam piensani
They are part of it.	Paykunaqa chaymanta hukninmi kanku.
An important person.	Huk importante runa.
No one knows everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imamanta yachanchu.
I knew what was important to me	Yacharqanim imakuna ñuqapaq ancha allin kasqanmanta
But no one seemed offended.	Ichaqa manan pipas phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
I mean, like never before	Niyta munani, mana hayk’aqpas hina
It doesn’t matter that	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu
I still want that.	Chaytaqa hinallam munani.
They are both really tough people though.	Iskayninkum chiqap sinchi runakuna ichaqa.
I haven't seen that before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam chaynataqa rikurqanichu
Yes, very very rich.	Arí, ancha ancha qhapaq.
I just wanted to sleep	Chayllam puñuyta munarqani
I want to be here faster	Aswan utqaylla kaypi munani
I do him very well	Ancha allintam ruwani paytaqa
He decided to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
Maybe he was there.	Ichapas chaypi karqa.
So it’s not easy to do.	Chaymi mana facilchu ruwayqa.
It’s a simple task that makes it so rewarding.	Sasa ruwaymi ancha allin kananpaq ruwan.
I immediately thought better of it.	Chayllam aswan allinta chaypi piensarqani.
if not, tell me.	mana chayqa willaway.
I thought he was crazy	Loco kananpaqmi piensarqani
But it just seemed too hard.	Ichaqa llumpay sinchi hinallam rikchakurqa.
Which is kind of awesome.	Imataq huk laya manchay.
I didn’t know he was in town	Manam yacharqanichu llaqtapi kasqanmantaqa
I have no idea what this is	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima kayqa kasqanmanta
Now he is almost always there	Kunanqa yaqa sapa kutim chaypi kachkan
I know a lot about this	Kaymantaqa achkatam yachani
That’s it now.	Chayqa kunanqa.
But of course you do.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanki.
He was right!.	¡Allintam nirqa!.
I couldn’t seem to stop myself from doing it	Manapaschá chayta ruwanaypaqqa hark’ayta atirqanichu
You’re not going to be happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanki.
Now he couldn't do it anymore.	Kunanqa manañam atirqachu.
I wonder what that is all about.	Tapukuni imamantataq chay kasqanmanta.
It may not be right for you.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman qanpaq.
I know you’re tired	Yachanim sayk’usqa kasqaykita
I really didn’t want to go out	Chiqaptaqa manam lluqsiyta munarqanichu
I was terrified of everything	Tukuy imamanta mancharisqa karqani
I don't worry too much.	Manam anchatachu llakikuni.
I desperately need to not do this	Sinchitan necesitasaq kayta mana ruwanaypaq
He allowed it to happen.	Payqa chaytam saqirqa.
I want to go with him here	Munani kaypi paywan ripuyta
It’s a very bad thing to do.	Ancha mana allin ruwaymi.
That’s it, he says.	Chayqa, nispas nin.
I would have loved more coffee	Aswan kukata anchata munani karqan
It’s just so hard so hard so hard.	Chaylla ancha sinchi ancha sinchi ancha sinchi.
I can’t find anything	Manam imatapas tarinichu
That’s about it.	Chayqa chaymanta.
I can’t help it again	Manan hukmanta yanapayta atiymanchu
I knew it was a big deal	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kasqanmanta
And this is pretty big though.	Hinaspa kayqa ancha hatun ichaqa.
It was the first day of high school.	Chayqa karqan colegiopi ñawpaq kaq p’unchaymi.
What a smart kid.	Ima yachaysapa wawa.
I don't feel comfortable at all here	Kaypiqa manam imapipas allintachu tarikuni
It was a wonderful time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Maybe he didn’t really want to.	Ichapas mana chiqaptachu munarqa.
That’s pretty tough.	Chayqa ancha sinchi.
I would love to talk to you	Munaymanmi qanwan rimayta
But for some reason he does.	Ichaqa imaraykupas chaytan ruwan.
I had things to do last night	Qayna tutam imakuna ruwanay karqa
I couldn’t imagine how he did it	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imayna ruwasqanmanta
He wanted to find her.	Payta tariyta munarqa.
I really wish he wouldn't	Chiqaptam munani mana chayta ruwananta
I have never felt unhappy	Manam haykapipas mana kusisqachu tarikurqani
I can’t do the talking	Manam rimayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I know you want that too	Yachanim qampas chayta munasqaykita
It doesn’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwanchu.
Probably not, but you’re in luck.	Manapaschá, ichaqa suerteyoqmi kanki.
I think it worked out well	Allintam lluqsirqa yuyani
He knew how she felt.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I have to do it right	Allintam ruwanay
I don't know what's wrong	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
A bad nasty problem.	Mana allin millay sasachakuy.
I was young and.	Ñuqaqa wayna karqani hinaspa.
It can’t be that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu kanman.
That’s why you’re sad.	Chayraykum llakisqa kachkanki.
I couldn’t think of anything else to do.	Manam huk ruwaypi yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I look forward to hearing back	Suyachkani kutichiyta uyariyta
He went there a lot	Chaymanqa anchatam rirqa
I love playing with him	Paywan pukllayta anchata munani
I hope to tell you everything in due course	Tukuy imata tiempollanpi willayta suyachkani
I don’t think it should be people	Manam piensanichu runakuna kananta
I was a year ago.	Huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqani.
I would have liked to have seen it	Munayman karqan chayta rikuyta
Here’s another one.	Kaypi huk kaq.
I can't find anything there.	Chaypiqa manam imatapas tarinichu.
He really wanted to talk.	Payqa chiqaptam rimayta munarqa.
I don’t think anything of it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensanichu
I'm fine, he says.	Allinmi kani, nispas nin.
Anywhere in the world, and beyond.	Maypipas kay pachapi, chaymanta hawapi.
I couldn’t do it anymore	Manañan ruwayta atirqanichu
I didn’t want to do that	Manam chayta ruwaytaqa munarqanichu
So angry if not.	Chaymi phiñasqa mana chayqa.
He said everything was going to be fine.	Payqa tukuy imapas allinmi kananta nirqa.
It could have been that easy.	Chayna facilmi kanman karqa.
I don’t know how else to describe the feeling.	Mana yachanichu imaynata hukmanta willayta chay sientekusqanmanta.
I can’t say exactly what it is	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman ima kasqanmantaqa
I wanted to be with him tonight	Kunan tutam paywan kayta munarqani
I don't think that would be a problem, but you never know.	Manam piensanichu chayqa sasachakuy kananta, ichaqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
I couldn’t speak or think	Manam rimayta nitaq yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
I wanted him very badly.	Ancha mana allintam paytaqa munarqani.
So knowledge.	Chaymi yachay.
I just wasn’t sure about him yet	Chayllaraqmi manaraq paymanta segurochu karqani
That’s what he knows.	Chayta payqa yachan.
He thought it was great.	Hatun kasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
Now he doesn't care about anything.	Kunanqa manam imamantapas imananpaschu.
He can’t understand anything.	Mana imatapas entiendeyta atinchu.
I was here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi karqani.
And this he seemed to do well.	Hinaspa kayta payqa allinta ruwananpaq hina karqan.
I didn’t know that was the case	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
But he knew what was going on.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imachus pasashasqanmanta.
It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
It was there that he decided to make the film.	Chaypin chay peliculata ruwananpaq yuyaykurqan.
I always wanted to do that	Sapa kutim chayta ruwayta munarqani
I didn't care what it was	Manam imananpaschu karqa ima kasqanmantaqa
I am usually like that.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna kani.
I think it’s good for you	Yuyaykuni qampaq allin kasqanmanta
I couldn't disagree there	Chaypiqa manam mana acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu
I knew it was you.	Yacharqanim qam kasqaykita.
I know you know who he is	Yachanim pi kasqanmanta yachasqaykita
I would be very happy	Ancha kusisqam kayman
I meant to say it would be fine	Allinmi kanqa nispaymi niyta munarqani
We are not that unreasonable.	Manam chayna mana yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
I would love to go there one day	Anchatan munani huk p’unchay chayman riyta
No first, second or second.	Mana ñawpaq, iskay kaq nitaq iskay kaq.
He does it for many days.	Achka punchawmi ruwan.
Whatever was on the surface was not human.	Imapas hawapi kaptinpas manam runachu karqa.
I can’t talk about it yet	Manaraqmi chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
The most difficult task.	Aswan sasa ruway.
I can’t bear to think about it	Manam aguantayta atinichu chaypi yuyaymanayta
He knows better.	Aswan allintam yachan.
I didn't know that, actually	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu, chiqaptaqa
What’s not.	Imataq mana.
I don't have much to do now	Kunanqa manam anchatachu ruwanay kachkan
I just didn’t know that was the story you wanted	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu chay willakuyta munasqaykita
He’s not the happiest I’ve ever been here.	Payqa manan aswan kusisqachu kaypi kasqaymanta.
But it was more good than bad.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi karqan mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
He won't do anything about this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas ruwanqachu.
This does two things.	Kayqa iskay ruwaykunata ruwan.
I think it’s a good idea	Yuyaykuni allin yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I heard it here.	Kaypi uyarirqani.
I wanted to get it right	Chaytaqa allintam hapiyta munarqani
I really hope someone can tell	Chiqamanta suyachkani pipas willayta atinman
I still couldn't see it	Kunankamapas manam rikuyta atirqanichu
I didn't notice him until now.	Kunankamaqa manam paytaqa repararqanichu.
I think maybe it was me	Yuyaykuni ichapas ñuqa karqani
Nothing whatsoever for you.	Mana imapas qampaq imapas.
That’s a difficult thing.	Chayqa sasam.
But, of course it’s not.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
Difficult to tell.	Sasa willay.
That sounds like him.	Chayqa pay hinam uyarikun.
I just couldn’t believe it was you	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu qan kasqaykita
I think he’s going to be successful	Yuyaykuni allin ruwaq kananta
It was beautiful at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sumaqmi karqa.
Obviously this wasn’t the first time.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu karqan.
I wonder if anyone knows of such a thing	Tapukunitaqmi sichus pipas yachan chayna kasqanmanta
Not as bad as you though.	Mana qam hina mana allinchu ichaqa.
He was a really great teacher.	Payqa chiqaptam hatun yachachiq karqa.
He had long since ceased to be the same man.	Payqa unayñan manaña kikin runachu karqan.
Twenty weeks with him, twenty weeks without him.	Iskay chunka semana paywan, iskay chunka semana mana paywan.
I may never do anything	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas imatapas ruwasaqchu
Everything was crazy.	Tukuy imapas loco hinam karqa.
I never thought of that!.	¡Manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu!.
I didn’t really know what he meant.	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima niyta munasqanmanta.
Now, you are again this time.	Kunanqa, kay kutipi yapamanta kanki.
Then, if you want to leave, that’s fine.	Chaymanta, ripuyta munanki chayqa, allinmi.
A week here and there	Huk semana kaypi chaypi
I can't believe how fast this summer has gone	Mana creeyta atinichu kay verano imayna utqaylla risqanmanta
I didn’t know what this was about	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta kayqa kasqanmanta
In fact, everything was fine.	Chiqaptaqa, tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I can’t do it all for you	Manam tukuyta ruwayta atiymanchu qampaq
I think there were a few people.	Iskay kimsa runakuna kasqanmantam piensani.
I couldn’t wait to be alone.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu sapallay kanaypaq.
He didn’t know what was wrong.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus mana allin kashasqanmanta.
I still don’t believe that	Chaytaqa manaraqmi creenichu
But he knew that would not be the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
If you have to do that.	Chayta ruwanayki kaptinqa.
So it’s not too bad.	Chaymi mana ancha mana allinchu.
He thought he needed it.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta necesitasqanmanta.
I feel the same way you do	Ñoqapas qan hinan sientekuni
I always wonder what happened to him	Sapa kutim tapukuni imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
I was always playing.	Sapa kutim pukllaq kani.
Why are you so good.	¿Imanasqataq ancha allin kanki.
Tell me what it looks like.	Willaway imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
I thought so at the time	Chay tiempopiqa chaynatam piensarqani
He couldn't get out of my place.	Manam maypi kasqaymanta lluqsiyta atirqachu.
I didn't think you wanted more	Manam piensarqanichu aswan achkata munasqaykita
That was a while ago though.	Chayqa karqan huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi ichaqa.
I’ve seen it many times before.	Ñawpaqtaqa askha kutitan rikurqani.
We are very proud of that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso kayku.
I probably did the same thing	Ñuqapas yaqapaschá chaynata ruwarqani
Maybe you’ll succeed, maybe you won’t.	Ichapas allinta ruwanki, ichapas mana.
Very difficult to do well.	Ancha sasa allinta ruwanapaq.
I know exactly what he can do.	Allintam yachani ima ruway atisqanmanta.
A couple of days, he said	Iskay kimsa punchaw, nispas nin
I wanted to talk to you about something	Imamantapas qanwan rimayta munarqani
I didn’t know what was going on in the world	Manam yacharqanichu kay pachapi imakuna pasasqanmanta
I never heard anything	Manam haykapipas imatapas uyarirqanichu
I feel very bad about it	Ancha mana allintam chaymantaqa sientekuni
I had no idea he was there	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa
It was difficult and uncomfortable.	Sasa hinaspa mana allinchu karqa.
It seemed to do the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwaq hinam karqa.
He is bigger than me now.	Kunanqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi.
He was something else, man.	Payqa huk imapas kasqa, runa.
I was a good teacher	Allin yachachiqmi karqani
But I am sure of it.	Ichaqa segurom kachkani.
This is the one.	Kayqa kaymi.
Tell me how you like it.	Imayna munasqaykita willaway.
It’s actually rather sad.	Chiqaptaqa aswan llakikuypaqmi.
I hope to hear from you soon	Suyachkani chaylla uyariyta
I did that too but I can't anymore	Ñuqapas chaytam ruwarqani ichaqa manañam atinichu
But it may not be right for you.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman qanpaq.
But no, it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hina facilchu.
Who, it always is.	Pikuna, sapa kuti kan.
He couldn’t deal with that now.	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa atipayta atirqanchu.
I have always been with him	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi paywan kuska kani
That’s not the case.	Chay hinaqa manan chay hinachu.
I thought he was you	Payqa qanmi kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
Perhaps he was a bad speaker.	Ichapas payqa mana allin rimaq karqa.
His second reaction was even more impressive	Iskay kaq ruwasqanqa aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa
I want to know how she feels about it.	Chaywanmi imayna sientekusqanmanta yachayta munani.
I knew he would do his best.	Yacharqanim tukuy atisqanman hina ruwananta.
Who is with me?.	¿Pitaq ñuqawan kachkan?.
I know it will be great	Yachanim hatun kananmanta
I strongly think it will do well.	Sinchitan yuyaykuni allinta ruwanqa.
I knew the house meant a lot to him	Yacharqanim chay wasi paypaq ancha allin kasqanmanta
I'm holding the money.	Qolqetan hap'ini.
Accordingly, he was appointed	Chayman hinam payqa churasqa karqa
I can’t seem to do anything about it now	Kunanqa manapaschá imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu hina
I was supposed to be here	Kaypim kanay karqa
It’s in the process.	Ruwaypi kachkan.
I’m afraid he wants to do something	Manchakuni imatapas ruwayta munasqanmanta
I just couldn't figure him out	Chayllam mana paytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
He doesn’t like to get hurt.	Payqa manan gustanchu k’irisqa kayqa.
They are not good.	Mana allinchu kanku.
He says he’s hurt.	Payqa ninmi k’irisqa kasqanmanta.
I want to hear about this	Kaymanta uyariyta munani
I want something more	Aswan imatapas munani
He came again last week.	Payqa qayna semanan yapamanta hamurqan.
I want it all the time	Tukuy tiempon chayta munani
That just seems evil.	Chayqa millay hinallam rikchakun.
And the next time.	Hinaspa qatiqnin kutipi.
I didn’t know it was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kananta
It’s not like everything should be.	Manan tukuy imapas kanan hinachu.
It was always this or that.	Sapa kutim kay utaq chay karqa.
I can’t say exactly what it is.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman ima kasqanmantaqa.
It was a great success!.	¡Hatun allin ruwaymi karqan!.
A new challenge.	Musuq sasachakuy.
He is a wicked man	Payqa millay runam
But it hasn’t worked out so far.	Ichaqa manan kunankamaqa allintachu ruwarqan.
I, however, knew better	Ñuqam ichaqa aswan allinta yacharqani
It is very cold there.	Chaypiqa llumpay chiri kachkan.
I can’t tell you anything	Manam imatapas willayta atiymanchu
This was much easier.	Kayqa aswan facilmi karqa.
Unfortunately, it’s lonely.	Llakikuypaqmi, sapallanmi.
I think he wanted to have sex with me	Yuyaykuni ñuqawan puñuyta munasqanmanta
That is nowhere to be found.	Chayqa manan maypipas kanchu.
I can't leave that to anyone	Chaytaqa manam pitapas saqiyta atiymanchu
He was great, actually.	Payqa hatunmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
I had things to do last night.	Qayna tutam imakuna ruwanay karqa.
I don’t care who he is or what he is.	Manam imananpaschu pi kasqanmanta, ima kasqanmanta.
The day will be like the night.	Punchawqa tuta hinam kanqa.
I meant head, of course	Uma niyta munarqani, chiqamanta
I didn’t want this job anymore	Manañam kay llamkayta munarqanichu
I wanted to know more about it.	Chaymanta astawan yachayta munarqani.
This was no longer an option.	Kayqa manañam huk ruwaychu karqa.
Something is better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
I can't believe you did that, for me	Manam creeyta atiymanchu chayta ruwasqaykita, ñuqapaq
I was immediately surprised	Chayllam admirakurqani
I felt foolish and alone	Mana yuyayniyuq hinaspa sapallay hinam tarikurqani
It wasn’t funny.	Manam asikunapaq hinachu karqa.
I didn’t want to quit again	Manam hukmanta saqiyta munarqanichu
I know you are in big trouble right now	Yachanim kunan hatun sasachakuypi kasqaykita
I still can't believe it	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa creeyta atinichu
I have never been so happy.	Manam haykapipas chayna kusisqachu karqani.
They want something.	Imatapas munanku.
You always want more.	Sapa kutim aswan achkata munanki.
I knew immediately that he was drunk	Chayllam yacharqani machasqa kasqanmanta
I want to get drunk and sleep	Machasqa kayta, puñuyta ima munani
I hope it works for you	Suyachkani qampaq allin kananpaq
He knew very well what to do, how much to do.	Payqa ancha allintam yacharqa ima ruwananta, hayka ruwananta.
It doesn’t matter if you do that.	Chayta ruwayqa manan imananpaschu.
He wasn’t the last time.	Payqa manan qhepa kutichu karqan.
I didn’t do that right	Chaytaqa manam allintachu ruwarqani
I want to know what makes it	Imataq ruwan chayta yachayta munani
There is no one like me.	Manam pipas ñuqa hinaqa kanchu.
I was very surprised today	Kunan punchawmi anchata admirakurqani
It turned out really well though.	Chiqamanta allinta lluqsirqa ichaqa.
It has its own ideas.	Kikin yuyayniyuqmi.
He is so tired he can barely walk.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqañan kashan, yaqapaschá puriyta atin.
I can’t eat it.	Manam mikuyta atinichu.
I know it’s going to go wrong	Yachanim mana allin pasananta
One to three times.	Hukmanta kimsa kutita.
I feel something wrong	Imapas mana allintam sientekuni
I really wanted him to be there	Chiqaptam munarqani chaypi kananta
He was the best man in the world.	Payqa kay pachapi aswan allin runan karqan.
But, though.	Ichaqa, ichaqa.
I had every intention of doing it	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa tukuy yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I want to know what they are like	Imayna kasqankuta yachayta munani
He realized why.	Payqa repararqanmi imarayku chayta.
I didn’t really see him at all anymore	Manañam chiqaptaqa ni imapipas rikurqanichu
I know you want to be there	Yachanim chaypi kayta munasqaykita
I want to do the right thing.	Munani chay allin ruwayta.
Now they are probably the majority.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá paykunaqa aswan askha runakuna kanku.
But it’s really, really good to be here.	Ichaqa chiqap, chiqap allin kaypi kayqa.
I can’t say that for sure	Manam chaytaqa allintachu niyta atiyman
I mean no, he doesn't	Niyta munani manam, payqa manam
I want to be there to help	Chaypi kaytam munani yanapanaypaq
He knew how to play this well.	Payqa allintam yacharqa kayta pukllayta.
I just didn’t expect that from anyone.	Chayllaraqmi mana pitapas chaytaqa suyarqanichu.
He didn’t want me here.	Payqa manan kaypichu munarqani.
I didn't think it would be so fast	Manam piensarqanichu chayna utqaylla kananta
I thought to myself.	nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
This guy isn’t.	Kay runaqa manam.
This is not what he should do.	Kayqa manam ruwananchu.
More about him.	Astawan paymanta.
He never acted in haste.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu imatapas ruwarqan.
He was really tired.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sayk’usqa kasharqan.
I did a very good job	Ancha allintam ruwarqani
I hope to hear from you one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw uyariyta.
All too often.	Tukuy ancha achka kuti.
But that would never work.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayqa allinchu kanman.
Both lived at home.	Iskayninku wasipi tiyaq.
But it’s not easy at all	Ichaqa manan imapipas facilchu
He knows what matters most.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna aswan allin kaqta.
I won't be able to get away without it	Mana chaywanqa manam lluqsiyta atisaqchu
I know about it.	Chaymantam yachani.
I know it now.	Kunanmi yachani.
But that was not what he wanted now.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu kunanqa munarqan.
I wouldn’t do it again	Manam yapamanta ruwaymanchu
I can’t pretend that nothing happened like you did	Manam qam hinaqa mana imapas pasasqanmantaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
You’ve done a great job.	Anchatan ruwarqanki.
This can't go on.	Kayqa manam puriyta atinchu.
And this one.	Hinaspa kay huknin.
Where the problem lies.	Maypichus chay sasachakuy kachkan.
He couldn’t tell how many there were.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu hayk’a kasqankuta.
And this does it quickly.	Hinaspa kayqa usqhayllan ruwan.
I just know what happened	Chaylla yachani imapas pasasqanmanta
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.	Ichapas imatapas mana allintachu ruwachkani.
I knew he wanted it	Yacharqanim chayta munasqanmanta
New to you and you are new to me.	Musuq qampaq hinaspa musuq kanki ñuqapaq.
I can’t remember what they look like now	Manam yuyariyta atinichu kunan imayna kasqankuta
I don't have time to do it again	Manam tiempoy kanchu hukmanta chayta ruwanaypaq
It makes no sense here.	Kaypiqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He didn’t want her to get hurt.	Payqa manan munarqanchu k’irisqa kananta.
That was the really, really best part.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know he was in this city	Manam yacharqanichu kay llaqtapi kasqanmanta
He stayed there for three years	Chaypin kinsa wata qhepakurqan
I am a first year teacher	Ñawpaq wata yachachiqmi kani
Don’t do that, man.	Ama chayta ruwaychu, runa.
But there has to be something else to do.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi kanan.
I didn't mean that, not really	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu, manam chiqaptachu
That wasn’t like him.	Chayqa manan pay hinachu karqan.
What is the right thing to do.	Imatataq ruwananchik.
I didn't, but he can't be alone	Manam ruwarqanichu, ichaqa manam sapallan kayta atinchu
I knew something like that was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna imapas kananmanta
I think maybe he knows where he’s going	Yuyaykuni ichapas payqa yachan mayman risqanmanta
I didn’t know he was sick	Manam yacharqanichu unqusqa kasqanmanta
I really wanted to leave	Anchatam munarqani ripuyta
I didn’t expect that at all	Chaytaqa manan imapipas suyarqanichu
He knew who he meant.	Payqa yacharqanmi pikuna niyta munasqanmanta.
I didn’t realize it would happen	Manam repararqanichu chayna pasananta
I never thought it would be that bad	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
That said about twice where it should be.	Chayta nispa yaqa iskay kuti maypichus kanan chaypi.
I want it to be mine	Munani ñuqapa kananta
A world where everything was easy and safe	Huk pacha maypichus tukuy imapas facil hinaspa seguro karqa
It might be a good thing.	Yaqapaschá allinpaq kanman.
If this is nowhere to be found, please let me know.	Sichus kay mana maypipas kanchu chayqa, ama hina kaspa, willaway.
He's doing really well.	Payqa chiqap allintam ruwachkan.
And now that’s not all.	Hinaspa kunanqa mana chayllachu.
I knew it would be soon	Yacharqanim chaylla kananta
Nothing funny about it.	Mana imapas asikunapaq hinachu chaymanta.
But what was it like.	Ichaqa imaynataq kasqa.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
A terrible one.	Huk manchay.
I didn’t realize what	Manam repararqanichu imata
I can’t understand someone like that	Manam chayna pitapas entiendeyta atiymanchu
That, however, was not the case	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan
I didn’t want to know that	Manam chayta yachayta munarqanichu
This is a new approach.	Kayqa musuq ruwaymi.
She was a real girl.	Chiqap sipasmi karqa.
Right now, maybe.	Kunanpacha, ichapas.
A few days after that	Iskay kimsa punchaw chaymanta
Nothing is unique here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas sapallanchu.
I feel really bad	Chiqamanta mana allinchu sientekuni
If something isn't 'that bad', let me know how it is.	Sichus imapas mana ‘chayna mana allinchu’ kaptinqa, willaway imayna kasqanmanta.
Instead, do this.	Aswanpas kayta ruway.
That really did it.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwarqa.
I didn’t want to be there at first	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaypi kayta munarqanichu
Not sure what's going on here.	Mana segurochu kaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
It was easy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa facilmi karqa.
The future.	Hamuq pacha.
I was there that night	Chay tutam chaypi karqani
There is a very big deal going on	Ancha hatun ruwaymi kachkan
I want you to be consistent	Chayman hina kanaykita munani
This will be a one-stop shop.	Kayqa huk kaq ruwaymi kanqa.
But no more of that.	Ichaqa manañan chaymantaqa.
I knew why.	Yacharqanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Not really.	Manam chiqaptaqa.
I can't work	Manam llamkayta atiymanchu
I know that you are	Yachanim chayna kasqaykita
He doesn't have time to do that.	Chaypaqqa manan tiempon kanchu chayta ruwananpaqqa.
I haven't been here in many years	Achka watañam mana kaypichu karqani
I didn't notice them	Chaykunataqa manam repararqanichu
He never did anything alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallan imatapas ruwarqanchu.
You can never be sure.	Manan hayk’aqpas seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
I wonder what it is about me that causes it	Tapukuni imataq ñuqamanta chayta ruwan
I’m not going to be good	Manam allinchu kasaq
I don’t care how good it is.	Manam imananpaschu imayna allin kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
You don't know what to make of him really.	Mana yachankichu imatataq paymanta ruwanaykita chiqaptapuni.
I thought it was the only thing	Chaylla kananpaqmi piensarqani
A little bit of time	Huk chikan pacha
He is with us tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
That guy is crazy.	Chay runaqa loco.
I do that all the time	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon ruwani
And so it is.	Hinaspa chayna.
I really don't know anything about anything.	Chiqaptaqa manam imamantapas imatapas yachanichu.
Very nice guy	Ancha sumaq wayna
I'll do it here	Kaypim ruwasaq
It is important to do two things a week.	Ancha allinmi kanman semanapi iskay ruwaykunata ruwayqa.
He will do that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi ruwanqa.
I had no idea what would happen next.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chaymanta imakuna kananmanta.
It makes more sense than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi.
That would be a good thing.	Chaywanqa allinmi kanman.
We made them a few months ago.	Chaykunataqa iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqayku.
I can’t say anything	Manam imata niyta atiymanchu
But I didn’t do much	Ichaqa manan anchatachu ruwarqani
But it will be easier.	Ichaqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
I mean, they’re there.	Niyta munani, chaypi kachkanku.
Maybe they were hungry.	Ichapas yarqasqa karqaku.
I can’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
But you know what, he’s a nice guy.	Ichaqa yachanki imata, payqa sumaq runam.
I didn't realize this	Kaytaqa manam repararqanichu
In the morning and in the evening.	Tutamanta, ch’isi ima.
I never wanted to be this famous	Manam haykapipas kayna riqsisqa kaytaqa munarqanichu
This is so good this thing!.	¡Kayqa ancha allinmi kay imapas!.
I had every intention.	Tukuy yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
I know it will never happen.	Yachanim mana haykapipas chayna kananta.
I probably did these things	Yaqapaschá chaykunataqa ruwarqani
I was very good at it.	Chaypiqa ancha allinmi karqani.
I knew he could never afford another.	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas hukta rantiyta atinanmanta.
You don’t think about it.	Manam chaypiqa piensankichu.
I am very happy and happy now	Kunanqa ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam kachkani
I was crazy.	Loco karqani.
I thought he was pretty handsome	Allin sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani
But this one wanted the worst of me.	Ichaqa kayqa ñoqamanta aswan mana allintan munarqan.
I really didn’t want to	Chiqaptaqa manam munarqanichu
Summer night.	Verano tuta.
He didn't know how he knew this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatas kayta yacharqan chayta.
I hear it quickly.	Usqhaylla uyarini.
I wonder who left it there	Tapukuni pitaq chaypi saqirqa
I was very proud of that	Chaywanmi anchata orgulloso karqani
He was an older man.	Kuraq runam karqa.
I don’t want to talk about this anymore	Kaymantaqa manañam rimayta munanichu
I may never be able to do that	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
This is what you are.	Kaymi kanki.
I feel like everything is mine	Tukuy imapas ñuqapa hinam tarikuni
There is someone here for you.	Kaypiqa kanmi huk runa qampaq.
But I feel happy	Ichaqa kusisqan sientekuni
That was rather simple.	Chay nisqanqa aswan facilmi karqan.
Not bad really.	Mana mana allinchu chiqap.
I never want to see him again	Manañam haykapipas payta qawayta munanichu
He doesn’t know.	Manam yachanchu.
I could certainly do it out there	Chiqamanta chay hawapi ruwayta atiyman karqa
I want to go outside	Hawaman lluqsiyta munani
Maybe this is for the best.	Ichapas kayqa allinpaq kanman.
I still don't understand that	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa entiendenichu
I don't remember what happened today	Kunan punchaw imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam yuyarinichu
There should be more people here.	Kaypiqa aswan achka runakunam kanan.
Maybe it was for the better.	Ichapas allinpaq karqa.
I couldn’t wait either	Ñuqapas manam suyayta atirqanichu
I am a very positive person.	Ancha allin yuyayniyuq runam kani.
I’m going to do this again.	Kayta yapamanta ruwasaq.
I can't be hurt	Manam k'irisqa kayta atiymanchu
But I don’t think he could do that	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu, nispaymi yuyaykuni
You know what day it is.	Yachanki ima punchawmi chay punchaw kasqanmanta.
Maybe someone was there.	Ichapas pipas chaypi karqa.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
There was probably someone there.	Chaypiqa yaqapaschá pipas karqa.
It takes a lot of it.	Achkatam necesitan.
I should never have agreed to this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa acuerdopichu kanay karqa.
I knew that was the case for me	Yacharqanim ñuqapaq chayna kasqanmanta
It turned out really nice.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq lluqsirqa.
Repeat twice more.	Iskay kutita yapamanta ruway.
I couldn’t let that happen	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu chayna kananta
So this has to be something else.	Chaymi kayqa huk imapas kanan.
I was very surprised by that.	Chaywanmi anchata admirakurqani.
He didn't want to talk again	Payqa manan yapamanta rimayta munarqanchu
Clearly, he could never do that	Sut’inmi kashan mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atisqanmanta
I could not have been happier with it	Manam chaywanqa aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu karqa
I didn’t think it was that good	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna allin kasqanmantaqa
But then something happened today.	Ichaqa chaymanta kunan punchaw imapas pasarqa.
But he was caught.	Ichaqa hap'isqa karqan.
No, it’s okay.	Manan, allinmi.
Something about him was wrong.	Paymanta imapas mana allinchu karqa.
The coldest day.	Aswan chiri punchaw.
He wasn’t there.	Payqa manam karqachu.
Which is uncertain.	Imataq mana segurochu.
He had to do what he said he would do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwanan karqa.
I couldn't stand it, and he knew it	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu, payqa chaytam yacharqa
Nice people, they are.	Sumaq runakuna, paykunaqa kanku.
I wasn’t very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu karqani chaypiqa.
This one time.	Kay huk kuti.
I’m glad it’s the latter.	Kusikuni qhipa kaq kasqanmanta.
This, he said.	Kayta, nispa.
In fact, he didn’t care anymore	Aswanpas manañan imananpaschu karqan
I was excited about this	Kaymantaqa kusisqam tarikurqani
I know you are always there for me	Yachanim sapa kuti ñuqapaq kasqaykita
I wonder if anyone was there	Pipas chaypi kasqanmantam tapukuni
I couldn’t say the word	Manam chay simitaqa niyta atirqanichu
I didn't think it was worth it	Manam piensarqanichu allinpaq kasqanmanta
He can’t, really.	Payqa manan atinchu, cheqaqtapuni.
We haven’t done much in a long time.	Unayñan mana anchatachu ruwarqayku.
It’s a wonderful way to do a book	Ancha sumaq ruwaymi librota ruwanapaq
I wonder how he feels	Tapukuni imayna sientekusqanmanta
I often have that problem	Sapa kutim chay sasachakuypi tarikuni
The same two.	Kikin iskay.
I knew there was something.	Imapas kasqanmantam yacharqani.
Let me know if it’s right.	Allin kaptinqa willaway.
I would love some help.	Anchatan munani wakin yanapayta.
I can’t eat anything	Manam imatapas mikuyta atinichu
There was no one to do it.	Manam pipas ruwananpaqqa karqachu.
He opened the front door.	Payqa ñawpaq kaq punkuta kicharirqa.
Without any sense of humor.	Mana ima yuyayniyuq.
Instead, it wasn’t good enough.	Aswanpas mana allinchu karqan.
I didn’t think this would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasananta
Or a human being.	Utaq huk runa.
Always a bad thing to do.	Sapa kuti mana allin ruway.
In the best possible way.	Aswan allin ruwaypi.
What are you going to do? 	¿Imatan ruwanki?
Both were excellent.	Iskayninkum ancha allin karqaku.
One by one, he said.	Hukmanta hukmanta, nispas nin.
I haven’t seen it yet	Manaraqmi rikurqanichu
I would not have done this	Kaytaqa manam ruwaymanchu karqa
A big deal a few weeks ago, less so now.	Huk hatun ruway iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqta, aswan pisi kunan.
That was obvious really.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan cheqaqtapuni.
Here they are again.	Kaypi yapamanta kachkanku.
But again, all this fails.	Ichaqa yapamanta, tukuy kaykunaqa mana allintachu ruwan.
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise.	Mana chayqa, mana chayqa, mana chayqa.
Maybe no one wants to do it wrong	Ichapas mana pipas mana allinta ruwayta munanmanchu
There is no past, no future.	Manam kanchu ñawpaq, mana hamuq pacha.
It was funny, he just isn't.	Asikunapaq hinam karqa, payqa manam chayllachu.
He can do that.	Payqa chayta ruwanman.
You don't know if it's there.	Chaypi kasqanmantaqa manam yachankichu.
I did it a few times	Iskay kimsa kutitam ruwarqani
He knew he would be there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kananta.
I think we should make a statement about it	Yuyaykuni chaymanta huk willakuyta ruwananchikpaq
He knows how to play well.	Payqa allintam pukllayta yachan.
He’s a really good player.	Payqa chiqap allin pukllaqmi.
But it was a very long time ago.	Ichaqa ancha unayñan karqan.
He was a very tough guy	Payqa ancha sinchi runam karqa
I want to tell you more about this problem.	Kay sasachakuymanta astawan willayta munani.
Both were arrested.	Iskayninkum hapisqa karqaku.
I want to know how and why he did it	Imaynatas chayta ruwasqanmanta, imarayku ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani
It was supposed to be the only thing.	Chayllam kanan karqa.
He left a year ago.	Payqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi ripurqan.
Good practice today.	Kunan pacha allin ruway.
I can’t eat or sleep.	Manam mikuyta nitaq puñuyta atinichu.
I want to talk about it again	Hukmanta rimayta munani
I didn’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
So, if you don't want that job, fine.	Chaymi, mana chay llamkayta munankichu chayqa, allinmi.
I want to know who this person is	Kay runa pi kasqanmanta yachayta munani
Everything, I want more to come	Tukuy ima, aswan achka hamunanta munani
So, it was kind of crazy.	Chaymi, huk laya loco hina karqa.
I haven’t been there in a long time	Unayñan mana chaypichu kashani
I barely know who he is	Yaqapaschá yachani pi kasqanmanta
But that’s not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa allinchu.
Big, crazy kid.	Hatun, loco wawa.
But if there is ever someone else, you better let me know now.	Ichaqa sichus hayk’aqllapas huk runa kanman chayqa, aswan allinmi kunan willaway.
I hope it will be for him	Suyachkani paypaq chayna kananta
And that was a good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi karqa.
And the one in the hospital.	Hinaspa hospitalpi kaq.
Everyone is wrong.	Lliwmi pantasqa kanku.
But these people.	Ichaqa kay runakuna.
I'm pretty good.	Allin allinmi kani.
He doesn’t know why.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku.
In fact, this is unfortunately not always the case.	Chiqaptaqa, kayqa llakikuypaqmi mana sapa kutichu.
Unfortunately, that was too good to be true.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa ancha allinmi karqan, chaymi mana cheqaqchu karqan.
I want to understand who this person is.	Kay runa pi kasqanmanta entiendeyta munani.
I wanted so badly to believe he was tired	Anchatam creeyta munarqani sayk’usqa kasqanpi
I am well aware of this	Kaymantaqa allintam yachani
What’s that.	Imataq chayta.
I mean, that wasn’t just me	Niyta munani, chayqa mana ñuqallachu karqani
That means if you want to be better.	Chayta niyta munan sichus aswan allin kayta munanki chayqa.
He most definitely does not.	Payqa aswan sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwan.
That made it twice as good.	Chaywanmi iskay kuti aswan allin karqa.
I couldn’t sleep after that	Chay qhepamanmi manaña puñuyta atirqanichu
After all, nothing was certain.	Tukuy imamanta, mana imapas segurochu karqa.
They were not that good.	Paykunaqa manam chayna allinchu karqaku.
But, who knows.	Ichaqa, pi yachan.
I can’t find that.	Chaytaqa manam tarinichu.
He couldn't see any more.	Manas astawan rikuyta atirqachu.
Otherwise, it will not happen.	Mana chayna kaptinqa manam kanqachu.
And then this now.	Hinaspa chaymanta kunan kay.
This was probably the first failure.	Kayqa yaqapaschá ñawpaq kaq mana allin ruway karqa.
I thought it was great	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani
That is the best way to do it.	Chay ruwayqa aswan allinmi.
I didn’t realize it was this week.	Manam repararqanichu kay semana kasqanmanta.
I wanted to see him, today	Payta rikuyta munarqani, kunan punchaw
I had to do some	Wakin ruwanay karqan
But I never knew what it was	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanichu imachus kasqanmanta
There was no one there anymore.	Manañam pipas chaypiqa karqachu.
I didn’t want money.	Manam qullqita munarqanichu.
How you deal with it and all that.	Imaynatachus chaywan ruwanki chaymanta tukuy chaywan.
I wasn’t sure what time it was.	Manam segurochu karqani ima hora kasqanmantaqa.
No one wanted to take it.	Manan pipas chayta hap’iyta munarqanchu.
That one is me.	Chay hukninmi ñoqa.
Maybe that’s it.	Ichapas chay.
Yeah, this kind of makes sense.	Arí, kayqa huk laya yuyayniyuqmi.
I didn’t know that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanichu
These happy people.	Kay kusisqa runakuna.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman chayqa.
I knew it wasn't that good for me	Yacharqanim mana chayna allin ñuqapaq kasqanmanta
I want to know what he’s doing	Ima ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani
He says he's so busy he can't get out.	Payqa ninmi chayna ocupasqa kasqanmanta mana lluqsiyta atinchu.
It was just as he had said.	Nisqanman hinam karqa.
And why he can’t wait.	Hinaspa imaraykun mana suyayta atinchu.
Therefore, it does not work well.	Chayraykum mana allintachu ruwan.
He really doesn’t know how to do that	Chiqamanta mana chayta ruwanaypaq yachanchu
I know when someone is real	Pipas haykapi chiqap kasqanmantam yachani
It will be soon enough.	Aswan pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
I know about this.	Kaymantaqa yachanim.
It really depends on who the bad boy is.	Cheqaqtapunin kanqa pichus chay millay wayna kasqanmanta.
I wish that was the journey for me.	Munaymanmi chayna puriyta ñuqapaq.
I can’t remember what happened	Manam yuyariyta atinichu ima pasasqanmanta
I have been here for a very long time.	Ancha unayñam kaypi kachkani.
It will continue to be.	Hinallam kanqa.
I wanted to do this and do it again	Kayta ruwayta hinaspa hukmanta ruwayta munarqani
But they seemed very happy and happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa hinam karqaku.
He does the work for you	Paymi qampaq chay llamkayta ruwan
He had been with her for about a year	Yaqa huk watañam paywan karqa
Actually, do ten of that.	Chiqaptaqa, chayta chunka ruway.
I couldn’t believe it either	Ñoqapas manan creeyta atirqanichu
That’s the process.	Chayqa chay ruwaymi.
I think it’s the best thing to do	Yuyaykuni aswan allin ruway kasqanmanta
Sadly sadly.	Llakisqa llakisqa.
I like it when he does that.	Chayta ruwaptinqa gustanmi.
I thought you might as well.	Yuyarqanim qampas chayna kanman.
I wanted to see if you were okay	Allinchu kasqaykita qawayta munarqani
I wasn't a stranger here, he said	Kaypiqa manam mana riqsisqa runachu karqani, nispa
He knew better than that.	Payqa aswan allintam yacharqa.
He can't see her.	Manam paytaqa qawayta atinmanchu.
Maybe he said it a couple of times before.	Ichapas huk iskay kutita ñawpaqta nirqa.
I just felt uncomfortable	Chayllam mana allinchu tarikurqani
I never knew anyone had done that recently	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta chayllaraq
I did the same thing, twice in fact	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwarqani, chiqaptaqa iskay kutitam
I used to be uncomfortable.	Ñawpaqtaqa manañam allinchu karqani.
He went right away.	Payqa chayllaraqmi rirqa.
I listened to them carefully	Chaykunataqa allintam uyarirqani
I always wanted to leave	Sapa kutim ripuyta munarqani
I don't think it's worth it.	Manam valenchu ​​nispam piensani.
I think that's something I should do too	Chayqa ñuqapas ruwanay kasqanmantam piensani
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu karqan.
I thought it was going to happen	Yuyarqanim chayna kananmanta
I have done this walk twice before.	Ñawpaqtaqa iskay kutitam kay puriyta ruwarqani.
That was certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
Two good, yeah, yeah.	Iskay allin, arí, arí.
I don’t know that you can do that.	Mana yachanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
He says he wants to talk to you.	Paymi nin qanwan rimayta munani nispa.
He never did it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
It’s easy to do that.	Chayta ruwayqa facilmi.
The day is beautiful.	Chay punchawqa sumaqmi.
I thought it was a good thing	Allinpaq kananpaqmi chaytaqa yuyaykurqani
You really are.	Chiqaptam qamqa kanki.
It’s a beautiful thing.	Sumaq kaq imapas.
I didn’t want to be in the present anymore	Manañam kunan pachapi kayta munarqanichu
I want to be there when you do.	Chayta ruwaptikiqa chaypi kaytam munani.
I want to play with you	Qanwan pukllayta munani
I knew it wasn't true	Yacharqanim mana chiqap kasqanmanta
I couldn’t bear to be home with him	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu paywan wasipi kanaypaq
I can’t ask you about that yet	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa tapuyta atiymanchu
I can’t let that happen	Manam chayna kananta saqiyta atiymanchu
That told you they were something.	Chayqa nisurqanki imapas kasqankuta.
It didn't seem so good now.	Kunanqa manam chayna allinchu rikchakurqa.
What would be easier?.	¿Imataq aswan facil kanman?.
But I didn’t know he would	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu chayta ruwananta
Maybe we should do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwananchik.
I want to say that.	Munani chayta niyta.
I’ll be in the front.	Ñawpaqpi kasaq.
I still didn't know if it was right	Kunankamapas manam yacharqanichu allinchu kasqanmantaqa
It will be yours eventually.	Qanpa kaqmi kanqa qhepaman.
I knew something was wrong now	Yacharqanim kunan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
I’ll do that as soon as possible.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwasaq.
I was out there maybe an hour.	Chay hawapi karqani ichapas huk hora.
I didn’t expect that answer	Manam chay kutichiyta suyarqanichu
He knew he didn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He looked sick.	Payqa unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
It was really, really nice.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sumaq karqa.
I was surprised at how it looked	Imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam admirakurqani
I don’t plan on sitting here much longer	Manam aswan unaytachu kaypi tiyayta yuyaykuni
I don’t really need it	Manam chiqaptachu necesitasaq
I was just there at the time	Chay tiempopiqa chayllaraqmi chaypi karqani
And then someone else.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk runa.
I was like you in school, you know	Ñoqapas qan hinan karqani escuelapi, yachanki
Not sure this is good.	Mana segurochu kay allin kasqanmanta.
I thought this was too cruel	Kayqa llumpay millay kasqanmantam piensarqani
Things began to go wrong.	Imapas mana allintam puriyta qallaykurqa.
You really want to do something.	Chiqaptam imatapas ruwayta munanki.
He does what he says he will do.	Ruwasaq nisqanman hinam ruwan.
I didn’t know why it was so hard for me	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chayna sasa ñuqapaq kasqanmanta
I was sure it was true	Seguro karqani cheqaq kasqanmanta
This is probably not the best way to do it.	Kayqa manachá allinchu kanman chayta ruwanapaq.
That would be a bit much for him, okay.	Chayqa huk chikan achka kanman paypaq, allinmi.
He doesn’t know what that might be.	Payqa manan yachanchu imachus chay kanman chayta.
I can’t help it under any circumstances	Manam ima kaptinpas yanapayta atiymanchu
I know you did something with him	Yachanim paywan imatapas ruwasqaykita
I thought this was a secret	Kayqa pakasqa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I should have been clearer.	Aswan sut’inmi kanay karqan.
I almost feel like a different person	Yaqa huk runa hinam tarikuni
I can’t imagine why it would be bad	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imanasqa mana allin kananta
You said don’t.	Qanmi nirqanki ama nispa.
He knew immediately.	Payqa chayllam yacharqa.
They are very easy.	Paykunaqa ancha facilmi kanku.
I’m glad I did	Kusikuni chayta ruwasqaymanta
So it was really hard.	Chaymi chiqap sasa karqa.
I can't do it now	Kunanqa manam atiymanchu
Of course, that is not true.	Arí, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I couldn’t get a job anywhere	Manam maypipas llamkayta tariyta atirqanichu
It’s really, really good.	Chiqap, chiqap allinmi.
However, that is not yet the case.	Ichaqa, chayqa manaraqmi kanchu.
That’s not what I meant really	Manam chaytachu niyta munarqani chiqaptaqa
I'm going to go, he said.	Risaq, nispa.
We did everything on time.	Tukuy imatam tiempollanpi ruwarqayku.
I think that’s what he meant	Chaytan niyta munarqan, nispan yuyaykuni
He was just arrested again a few months ago.	Chayraqmi iskay kinsa killa ñawpaqta yapamanta hap’isqa karqan.
I wonder where they are	Maypi kasqankuta tapukuni
Maybe, maybe he knew anyway.	Ichapas, ichapas imayna kaptinpas yacharqa.
I know when he was angry	Yachanim haykapi phiñasqa kasqanmanta
At least, maybe.	Aswanpas, ichapas.
I certainly heard something about it	Cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa imatapas uyarirqani
Maybe in the world.	Ichapas kay pachapi.
It doesn’t matter, we’re here.	Manam imananpaschu, kaypim kachkaniku.
I didn’t really know about that.	Chaymantaqa manam allintachu yacharqani.
They were arrested, of course.	Paykunaqa hap’isqa karqanku, chiqamanta.
It was supposed to be good.	Allinmi kanan karqa.
I thought it would be bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kananta yuyaykurqani.
But he didn’t live there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu yacharqan.
I can't seem to understand this.	Kaytaqa manam entiendeyta atiymanchu hina.
I must be the only one you want	Ñuqallam qampa munasqayki kanay
He wanted nothing to do with this.	Payqa manan kaypiqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.
So what a great achievement.	Chaymi ima hatun ruwaymi.
I couldn't say those things	Chaykunataqa manam niyta atirqanichu
Which is by no means a bad thing.	Imataq mana imaraykupas mana allinchu.
He wanted to talk yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi rimayta munarqa.
I never wanted to be that kind of person	Manam haykapipas chayna runa kaytaqa munarqanichu
I am very happy about this	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta
I'm probably making a lot out of nothing	Yaqapaschá mana imamantapas achkata ruwachkani
He certainly knew what to do.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yacharqan imatapas ruwananpaq.
People want easy and fast.	Runakunaqa munanku facil hinaspa utqaylla.
I did, but that one failed	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa chay hukninmi mana allintachu ruwarqa
I was him.	Paytaqa karqani.
Then he began to fix it.	Chaymantam allichayta qallaykurqa.
He was a very good baseball player	Payqa ancha allin béisbol pukllaqmi karqan
I really want to get home	Wasiyman chayayta anchata munani
Or to anyone else.	Utaq pimanpas.
I couldn’t seem to find it	Manas tariyta atirqanichu hina
Very stupid, that.	Ancha sonso, chay.
What was supposed to happen.	Imataq kanan karqa.
I was surprised by it, actually	Chaywanmi admirakurqani, chiqaptaqa
I thought about it too	Ñuqapas chaypim piensarqani
As much as he can about it.	Atisqanman hina chaymanta.
Be happy, be beautiful.	Kusisqa kay, sumaq kay.
I felt happier	Aswan kusisqam tarikurqani
He wouldn’t have wanted to.	Manam munanmanchu karqa.
Maybe he would have been arrested.	Ichapas hapisqa kanman karqa.
I mean, there was nothing wrong with it	Niyta munani, mana ima mana allinchu karqa
I think he wants to reach out	Yuyaykuni chayayta munasqanmanta
But you’ve done it before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqanki.
There are such people.	Chayna runakunaqa kanmi.
We just didn’t do it right.	Chaylla mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
Now I knew who he was	Kunanqa yacharqanim pi kasqanmanta
It was a really terrible time	Chiqamanta manchay tiempo karqa
I’ll probably go	Yaqapaschá risaq
A big and fast one	Huk hatun hinaspa utqaylla
Tell the secret.	Willay pakasqa kaqta.
I almost want it	Yaqapaschá munani chayta
I’ve heard it for a long time	Unayñan uyarirqani
I was so happy and excited about it	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam chaymanta karqani
I do that well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwani.
I didn’t know how to get there	Manam yacharqanichu imayna chayayta
He is very happy to be here.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan kaypi kasqanmanta.
He refused to eat anything.	Payqa manan imatapas mikhuyta munarqanchu.
I will certainly do so.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwasaq.
I never wanted it for anything	Manam haykapipas imapaqpas munarqanichu
I wasn’t very happy	Manam ancha kusisqachu tarikurqani
I want to be last.	Qhipa kayta munani.
But it wouldn't be difficult.	Ichaqa manan sasachu kanman chayqa.
I wonder why this is happening.	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq kayna kasqanmanta.
But it didn’t really matter.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu importante karqan.
I couldn’t remember it at all	Manam imapipas yuyariyta atirqanichu
I do that again here.	Ñuqa kaypi yapamanta chayta ruwani.
I hope he doesn't get hurt	Suyachkani mana k'irisqa kananpaq
Otherwise everything was better.	Mana chayqa tukuy imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
It looked pretty nice.	Allin sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
I never saw him again.	Manañam paytaqa rikurqanichu.
She didn't know what to make of him.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu paymanta ima ruwananta.
I can’t imagine it that way	Manam chaynataqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
Not sure how to go from here.	Mana segurochu imaynatachus kaymanta riyta.
He couldn't understand why.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Strong man.	Sinchi runa.
He felt very, very sick.	Payqa ancha, ancha unqusqa hinam tarikurqa.
I was really angry	Cheqaqtapunin phiñasqa karqani
I don't care if it's someone else.	Manam imananpaschu huk runa kasqanmantaqa.
I can’t be there.	Manam chaypiqa kayta atiymanchu.
I could never stand it	Manam haykapipas aguantayta atirqanichu
Everyone was outside.	Lliwmi hawapi karqaku.
I feel angrier than anything	Imamantapas aswan phiñasqa sientekuni
And that’s all, you know.	Hinaspa chaylla, yachanki.
This was not like yesterday.	Kayqa manam qayna punchaw hinachu karqa.
That was the worst thing I could do.	Chayqa aswan mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
This is the type.	Kay laya.
I didn’t want to hear that	Manam chayta uyariyta munarqanichu
It’s a nice evening	Sumaq ch’isi
I can’t talk about anything.	Manam imamantapas rimayta atiymanchu.
I don’t plan on doing that now	Kunanqa manan chayta ruwayta yuyaykunichu
Maybe I should do it anyway	Ichapas imayna kaptinpas ruwanay kanman
You are, anyway.	Qamqa kanki, imayna kaptinpas.
I will do everything for you.	Tukuy imatam qampaq ruwasaq.
I couldn’t get out	Manam lluqsiyta atirqanichu
I was glad he was there.	Chaypi kasqanmantam kusisqa tarikurqani.
But, no, he won’t.	Ichaqa, manan, manan ruwanqachu.
I knew what was going to happen	Yacharqanim imakuna pasananta
He’s a big time player.	Payqa hatun pacha pukllaqmi.
And it would be thirty tomorrow.	Hinaspa paqarin kimsa chunka kanman.
Said he wasn't sure.	Nisqa mana segurochu kasqanmanta.
I mean, yeah, good for him	Niyta munani, arí, allin paypaq
You’re the morning.	Qam chay paqarin.
You know who you are.	Yachankim pi kasqaykita.
I was about half human	Yaqa kuskan runam karqani
The best way to say it is no, you don’t have to.	Aswan allin rimayqa manan, manan chaytachu ruwanayki.
He now knew why.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqa imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I can't deal with being the bad guy for him anymore	Manañam atipayta atinichu paypaq mana allin runa kayqa
I don’t see any point in it at all	Manam imapaqpas chaymantaqa rikunichu ni imapipas
It was the same thing.	Chayna kaqmi karqa.
I never knew he could do this	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqanmanta
You do that all the time.	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon ruwanki.
Repeat for success.	Allin kananpaq yapamanta ruway.
I know she is really afraid of him	Yachanim chiqaptapuni payta manchakusqanmanta
For the first time in the world.	Ñawpaq kuti kay pachapi.
I can agree with that	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayta atiyman
I can’t seem to remember his name	Manapaschá sutinta yuyariyta atiymanchu
I want to live here	Kaypi tiyayta munani
Two different people.	Iskay chikan runakuna.
Was glad I was here.	Kusisqa karqan kaypi kasqaymanta.
I know you know that.	Yachanim chayta yachasqaykita.
I feel really safe now	Kunanqa cheqaqtapunin seguro sientekuni
A year ago, he was human	Huk wata ñawpaqta, payqa runa kasqa
About an hour.	Yaqa huk hora.
I knew this was coming for a long time	Unayñan yacharqani kayqa hamunanta
What is the characteristic? 	¿Imataq kachkan?
That’s, it’s not yet.	Chayqa, manaraqmi.
I do, I did, I feel good with him, with him	Ñuqaqa ruwani, ruwarqani, allinta sientekuni paywan, paywan kuska
It’s the same day.	Chay kikin punchawmi.
I wanted to catch him	Payta hap’iyta munarqani
He’s sick.	Unqusqa kachkan.
He will do it with you.	Ruwanqa qanwan.
He can't wait.	Manam suyayta atinchu.
At least I think it is	Aswanpas chayna kasqanmantam piensani
He didn’t refuse.	Payqa manan mana munarqanchu.
You know, this is pretty big.	Yachanki, kayqa ancha hatunmi.
But no one thought about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaypi yuyaykurqanchu.
I still feel like I'm not ready.	Kunankamapas manaraq listo hinam tarikuni.
I’m a little tired now	Kunanqa huk chhikantan sayk’usqa kashani
I don’t remember how it happened before	Manam yuyarinichu ñawpaqta imayna pasasqanmanta
I'm not really quite sure how to go about this.	Manam chiqaptachu allinta yachani imaynatam kaymanta risaq.
I want to buy that.	Chayta rantiyta munani.
He must do this properly.	Kayta allinta ruwanan tiyan.
Here are the people.	Kaypi runakuna.
I had to act like an adult	Kuraq runa hinam imatapas ruwanay karqa
But obviously he has to be smart.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kashan yachaysapa kananta.
No one could have found it.	Manam pipas tariyta atinmanchu karqa.
I hear him every day, every night	Paytaqa sapa punchawmi, sapa tutam uyarini
I knew it was too much	Yacharqanim llumpay kasqanmanta
But of course, they weren’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqanku.
You better do it wrong.	Aswan allintam mana allinta ruwanayki.
Two days ago.	Iskay punchaw ñawpaqta.
I was supposed to be the one	Ñuqam chayna kanay karqa
I knew it was going to be mine	Yacharqanim ñuqapaq kananta
I had no idea what that was about	Manam piensarqanichu imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t know what was going on	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam ima mana allinchu karqa.
He couldn’t stay out.	Payqa manan hawapi qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
He looked just like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinam rikchakurqa.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
I want to know the truth about myself	Ñoqaqa ñoqamanta cheqaq kaqta yachayta munani
Know what you mean.	Yachay ima niy munasqaykita.
It was a summer afternoon.	Chayqa karqan verano tarde.
I'm not sure what the problem is, here.	Manam segurochu kani ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta, kaypi.
I don’t think that’s true anymore	Chayqa manañan cheqaqchu, nispan yuyaykuni
I wonder what they want	Tapukuni imatataq munanku
I thought it was silly.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuq kananpaqmi piensarqani.
I hope it’s a wonderful school year	Suyachkani sumaq yachay wata kananpaq
I couldn’t remember what	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imamanta
He is not like a man.	Payqa manan runa hinachu.
I want to hear all about it	Tukuy chaymanta uyariyta munani
I tried a lot but I couldn't.	Achkatam kallpanchakurqani ichaqa manam atirqanichu.
I shouldn’t be here	Manam kaypichu kanay
I desperately wanted to know what he was thinking	Sinchitan munarqani ima yuyaykusqanmanta yachayta
I couldn’t talk or anything	Manam rimayta atirqanichu nitaq imatapas
I can’t say who it is	Manam niyta atiymanchu pi kasqanmanta
I wasn’t nearly ready for that	Chaypaqqa manan yaqa listochu karqani
Not too sure why.	Mana ancha segurochu imarayku.
I still don't see him	Kunankamapas manam paytaqa rikunichu
I think that was the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
Who is the best person.	Pitaq aswan allin runa.
He didn’t ask much about this.	Payqa manan anchatachu kaymanta tapurqan.
I think this is a learning process.	Kayqa yachay ruwaymi nispam yuyani.
I don’t like talking about it.	Manam gustanchu chaymanta rimayqa.
You can never be too early.	Manan hayk’aqpas nishuta temprano kayta atiwaqchu.
Nothing for that matter.	Mana imapas chaypaqqa.
You can never be.	Manan hayk’aqpas kayta atiwaqchu.
Unfortunately there aren’t more like him.	Llakikuypaqmi mana pay hina aswan kanchu.
I think it’s a mistake.	Yuyaykuni pantasqa kasqanmanta.
It had been worse for a long time.	Unayñan aswan mana allinqa karqan.
I have no idea what happened next	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan yuyaykunichu
In fact, in fact, they were probably half an hour late.	Chiqaptaqa, chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá kuskan hora tardeta karqaku.
A good guy	Huk allin runa
He wanted me home.	Payqa wasiyman munarqa.
But that's it for now.	Ichaqa chaymi kunankamaqa.
He wasn’t sure where he learned the language.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan maypi chay simita yachasqanmanta.
Do you mean to say? 	¿Niyta munankichu?
He had been with her for ten years	Chunka watañam paywan karqa
Soon he entered the house.	Pisi tiempollamantan chay wasiman haykurqan.
All day long, you just are.	Tukuy punchawmi, chaylla kanki.
Both want to learn more.	Iskayninkum astawan yachayta munanku.

It’s not even.	Manam nitaq.
I knew it was him	Yacharqanim pay kasqanmanta
I was a young woman.	Ñuqaqa sipasmi karqani.
I don’t see who it is	Manam rikunichu pi kasqanmanta
It’s going to come along well.	Allinmi hamunqa.
No, this is more serious.	Manan, kayqa aswan hatunmi.
I knew you were better off without me	Yacharqanim mana ñuqawanqa aswan allin kasqaykita
I have to make it happen	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwanay kachkan
To be there for him.	Paypaq chaypi kananpaq.
Here’s how to do it.	Kaypi imayna ruwanapaq.
The night was better.	Tutaqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I'd rather not have to	Aswan allinmi kanman mana ruwanay kasqanmanta
He wanted to talk to her.	Paywan rimayta munarqa.
One at a time, or both together.	Hukmanta hukmanta, utaq iskayninku kuska.
I mean, you can’t beat it	Niyta munani, mana atipayta atiwaqchu
There was nothing there anyway	Imayna kaptinpas chaypiqa manam imapas karqachu
I wish you were here more	Astawan kaypi kasqaykita munayman
But he's not sure where he is now.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kunan maypi kasqanmanta.
I hope that doesn’t happen	Suyachkani chay mana pasananta
There was nothing at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam imapas karqachu.
What do you think will happen?.	¿Imataq pasananta yuyanki?.
I didn’t know it was going to be a problem	Manam yacharqanichu sasachakuy kananta
He thought about it for a while.	Chaypin huk rato yuyaykurqan.
He did that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi ruwarqa.
In most cases this is true.	Yaqa llapanpim kayqa chiqap.
I actually mean that seriously	Chiqaptaqa chaytam serio niyta munani
I certainly didn’t want to	Cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanichu
He had never been there.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypiqa karqanchu.
I'll do it now, that's all.	Kunanmi ruwasaq, chaylla.
They seemed to be doing pretty well.	Paykunaqa allin allinta ruwaq hinam karqaku.
He goes everywhere.	Payqa maymanpas rin.
Not like before, at least.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu, aswanpas.
I'm always too busy, for anything	Sapa kutim ancha ocupasqa kani, imapaqpas
I want to do things	Imakunatapas ruwayta munani
I can’t speak to you	Manam rimayta atiymanchu
I think that’s not right right now	Yuyaykuni chayqa manan allinchu kunanpacha
I just thought it would be nice	Chayllam piensarqani sumaq kananta
I think three every morning should be about fine	Yuyaykuni kimsa sapa paqarin yaqa allin kanan
This process is a milestone.	Kay ruwayqa huk hatun ruwaymi.
I tried to do the same thing	Ñuqapas chaynata ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani
One day, the same night.	Huk punchaw, kikin tuta.
Everything went wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
That’s about right, he thinks.	Chayqa yaqa allinmi, nispas yuyaykun.
I couldn't remember what he said	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu ima nisqanta
I was nervous and excited	Mancharisqa hinaspa kusisqam tarikurqani
Intelligent, rich.	Yuyayniyuq, qhapaq.
It’s a tough task, obviously.	Sinchi ruwaymi, sut’inmi.
You can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atiwaqchu.
He was angry that he had done so well.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan chhayna allin ruwasqanmanta.
I still want to see what happens.	Hinallam imakuna pasananta qawayta munani.
I can't do anything about it now	Kunanqa manam chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
It just sounds right.	Chaylla uyarikun.
This is the adult head.	Kaymi hatun runa uma.
No one knows what it is.	Manan pipas yachanchu.
I usually did that.	Yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
I'm not sure exactly why	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
We cannot do anything without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
I knew he wouldn't be out of his mind much longer	Yacharqanim manaña aswan unaytachu mana yuyayniyuq kananta
I did them all the time	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim ruwarqani
Or something else.	Utaq huk imatapas.
Good practice here.	Kaypi allin ruway.
Everything is here.	Tukuy imakuna kaypi kachkan.
I didn’t know this was hard for him.	Manam yacharqanichu kayqa paypaq sasa kasqanmanta.
He was fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi karqa.
One can never tell.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas willayta atinmanchu.
I knew it was all there was, it was very fast	Yacharqanim tukuy ima kasqanmanta, ancha utqaylla kasqanmanta
A new and fresh type	Huk musuq hinaspa musuq laya
It usually does a better job.	Yaqa llapanpim aswan allin llamkayta ruwan.
I thought that was crazy.	Chayqa loco kananpaqmi piensarqani.
They are not that good.	Paykunaqa manan chay hina allinchu kanku.
Now I know for sure	Kunanqa allintam yachani
He can't fix it.	Payqa manam allichayta atinchu.
If that sounds crazy, it kind of is.	Sichus chay loco hina uyarikun chayqa, huk laya hinan.
I thought you wanted this	Kayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani
That something will be there.	Chay imapas chaypi kanqa.
It doesn't really look like it.	Mana chiqaptachu rikchakun.
I would never be able to see it again	Manañam haykapipas chayta qawayta atiymanchu karqa
Here is the future.	Kaypiqa hamuq punchawmi kachkan.
If it is there.	Sichus chaypi kashan chayqa.
I mean, you look fine with that	Niyta munani, chaywanqa allintam rikchakunki
Everything else came second.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaqmi hamurqa.
I still can't find him	Kunankamaqa manam paytaqa tarinichu
I didn’t want to rush him	Manam paytaqa utqaylla puriyta munarqanichu
I didn’t want anyone to know	Manam munarqanichu pipas yachananta
I had to be there with him.	Chaypim paywan kanay karqa.
I regret what I did in the past	Ñawpaqpi ruwasqaymanta llakikuni
They know what’s next.	Paykunaqa yachanku ima qatiqnin kasqanmanta.
He couldn’t stand it anymore.	Manañam aguantayta atirqachu.
He is always there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi kachkan.
There were two options.	Chayna kaptinqa iskay ruwaymi karqa.
I can’t wait, actually	Manam suyayta atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa
Now he couldn't go.	Kunanqa manañam riyta atirqachu.
I am inclined to agree.	Ñuqapas chaytam acuerdopi kayta munani.
They weren’t happy.	Paykunaqa manan kusisqachu karqanku.
I have said that many times	Chaynatam achka kutipi nirqani
He continues to do so.	Hinallam chaynata ruwan.
Probably very happy.	Yaqapaschá ancha kusisqa.
He did much better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwarqan.
They don’t know exactly yet.	Paykunaqa manaraqmi allintachu yachanku.
Absolutely.	Aswan llapan.
I know it's wrong	Yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta
I don’t care who it is.	Manam imananpaschu pi kasqanmanta.
I don’t have that idea	Manam chay yuyayniyuqchu kani
I don't think it is.	Manam piensanichu chaytaqa.
I, too often, find myself out here alone.	Ñuqa, ancha sapa kuti, sapallay kay hawapi tarikuni.
I feel so terribly sad	Ancha manchay llakisqa sientekuni
I knew what he was thinking.	Yacharqanim ima piensasqanmanta.
We have been together for ten years now.	Kunanqa chunka watañam kuska kachkaniku.
I agree with you about that	Chayna kasqanmantam qanwan acuerdopi kani
You were right, it was the right thing to do.	Allinmi karqanki, allin ruwaymi karqan.
We are very excited about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkaniku.
This way, then that way.	Kay hinata, chaymanta chay hinata.
It's too fast anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ancha utqayllam.
I don’t know about that	Manam yachanichu chaymantaqa
It’s not really like that .	Manan cheqaqtachu chhayna kashan .
I know it means a lot to him	Yachanim paypaq ancha allin kasqanmanta
You know exactly what he does.	Qamqa allintam yachanki ima ruwasqanmanta.
I was walking around the house	Wasipi puriq kani
I couldn’t let anything happen to her.	Manam imatapas paywan pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
All the time in the world.	Tukuy pacha kay pachapi.
I can work with that	Chaywanmi llamkayta atiyman
But most of the time they know it.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa yachanku.
That’s what he said.	Chaynatam payqa nirqa.
Or the moon.	Utaq killa.
I hope that is the case	Chayna kananpaqmi suyachkani
I can’t really say yet	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu
I thought he did it all the time	Yuyarqanim sapa kutilla chayta ruwasqanmanta
I wanted to be a good person	Allin runa kaytam munarqani
All of these are good things.	Tukuy kaykunaqa allinmi.
That’s if he’s at home.	Chayqa wasinpi kaptinqa.
There seems to be many, one no one wants another.	Achka hinam kanku, huk mana pipas hukta munanchu.
I couldn’t stand it	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu karqa
An easy one, perhaps.	Huk facil kaq, ichapas.
I actually don't like instant coffee.	Chiqaptaqa manam gustanchu chaylla kukata.
But that’s not really a problem.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa sasachakuy.
I could never understand that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas entiendeyta atirqanichu
I wasn’t sure what it was	Manam segurochu karqani ima kasqanmantaqa
I want to get there as soon as possible	Chaymanqa utqaylla chayayta munani
Someone not very well known.	Pipas mana ancha riqsisqa.
One would rather not think about it.	Huk runaqa aswan allinmi kanman mana chaypi yuyaymanayta.
I think that was the right thing to do	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
I didn’t know where you were	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqaykita
I know what they are.	Yachanim ima kasqankuta.
This is the day.	Kaymi chay punchaw.
That thing is huge.	Chay imapas hatunmi.
This is still a process	Kayqa kunankamapas huk ruwaymi
He couldn't hold it.	Payqa manam hapiyta atirqachu.
It just has to go.	Chayllaraqmi rinan.
I didn’t want to be fired	Manam qarqusqa kayta munarqanichu
He always says and does the right thing.	Payqa sapa kutim allin kaqta nin hinaspa ruwan.
Indeed, he came very frequently.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ancha sapa kutilla hamurqan.
But he did the best he could.	Ichaqa atisqanman hinan allinta ruwarqan.
They were early.	Paykunaqa temprano karqanku.
I’m sorry about that	Chaymantam llakikuni
I feel lonely, very sad and very sad	Sapallanmi tarikuni, ancha llakisqa hinaspa ancha llakisqa tarikuni
I always knew you were great	Sapa kutim yacharqani hatun kasqaykita
But these people are fine, unfortunately.	Ichaqa kay runakunaqa allinmi, llakikuypaqmi.
I know this is not good for her.	Yachanim kayqa mana allinchu paypaq.
Say what you want.	Ima munasqaykita niy.
He couldn't hear anything.	Payqa manan imatapas uyariyta atirqanchu.
With it, he can do whatever he wants.	Chaywanmi ima munasqantapas ruwayta atin.
I knew there was something about you	Yacharqanim qammanta imapas kasqanmanta
Many weren’t there.	Achka mana chaypichu karqa.
I had to be the bigger person there	Chaypiqa aswan hatun runam kanay karqa
I don't understand why.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I was the only child	Ñuqallam wawa karqani
Better address this now	Aswan allinmi kanman kunan kayta allichayta
But now he is not so sure.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan chhayna segurochu kashan.
I look forward to speaking with you.	Suyachkani qamwan rimayta.
I always worry about him	Sapa kutim paymanta llakikuni
I always know when the time is right	Sapa kutim yachani haykapi chay tiempo allin kasqanmanta
Like anything else.	Imapas hina.
You want him to.	Payta munanki.
But it was a very bad thing.	Ichaqa sinchi mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
I knew where this was going	Yacharqanim mayman kayqa risqanmanta
I haven’t done much with it since though	Chaymanta pacha mana anchatachu ruwarqani chaywan ichaqa
He didn’t know enough about her yet.	Payqa manaraqmi allintachu yacharqan paymanta.
Before, anyway, he wanted to tell.	Manaraq, imayna kaptinpas, willayta munarqa.
That’s when it happened	Chayqa hayk’aqmi karqan
I know it’s important to him	Yachanim paypaq ancha allin kasqanta
So sick of him.	Chayna unqusqa paymanta.
To be great.	Hatun kananpaq.
I know how you do it	Yachanim imayna ruwasqaykita
This is not very easy.	Kayqa manam ancha facilchu.
Maybe one day I'll need it	Ichapas huk punchaw necesitasaq
I'm waiting	Suyachkani
Probably next week again.	Yaqapaschá hamuq semanapi yapamanta kanqa.
Anyway, that's what we did.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaytam ruwarqayku.
But this is not certain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kayqa.
I can’t be this this for you	Manan kay kayta atiymanchu qanpaq
Why do you think this thing is better.	Imaraykutaq kay imapas aswan allin kananpaq yuyanki.
It’s probably there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi kachkan.
People younger than me.	Ñoqamanta sullk’a runakuna.
That’s the bad guy.	Chay millay runa.
I know what this is about	Yachanim imamanta kayqa rimachkan
Such people have no sense.	Chayna runakunaqa manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanku.
But you’re doing the right thing.	Ichaqa allintan ruwanki.
I know a way.	Huk ñanta yachani.
I’ve done that successfully before	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi allinta ruwarqani
I didn’t know what was worse	Manam yacharqanichu ima aswan mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I thought you were cold	Yuyarqanim chiri kanki nispa
Being your own person.	Kikin runa kay.
I said that without any thought	Chaytaqa mana ima yuyayniyuqmi nirqani
He knows they are scared.	Payqa yachanmi mancharisqa kasqankuta.
He wants to know if it’s true.	Payqa yachayta munan chiqap kasqanmanta.
I hold that it is not.	Mana chayna kasqanmantam hapini.
It couldn’t have been better.	Mana aswan allinchu kanman karqan.
It did the job.	Llamk’ayta ruwarqa.
I can't say exactly when.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman haykapi kasqanmantaqa.
That’s not right now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa allinchu.
But he obviously thought so.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chay hinata yuyaykurqan.
Maybe this evening.	Ichapas kunan chisi.
He has to do a job	Huk llamkayta ruwanan
If so, it’s nice.	Chayna kaptinqa, sumaqmi.
All the better.	Tukuy aswan allin.
I thought that was a pretty good move.	Chayqa allin allin ruway kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Not every day.	Mana sapa punchawchu.
I had a hard time last year	Qayna wata sasachakuypi tarikurqani
We are not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanchik.
I've never been able to work that hard	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa llamkayta atirqanichu
But there is no such thing as this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinaqa kanchu.
Yes, it does.	Arí chaytam ruwan.
I thought you knew how to be better than that	Chaymanta aswan allin kayta yachasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I wasn't quick enough for you	Manam qampaq hinachu utqaylla karqani
I need food right now	Kunanpacha mikhunata necesitasaq
I can’t stop it or stop it	Manan hark’ayta atiymanchu nitaq hark’ayta atiymanchu
You are a very nice person	Ancha sumaq runam kanki
It’s the best part there.	Chaypi aswan allin kaqmi.
Whatever it is that.	Ima kaptinpas chay.
But it would be easier.	Ichaqa aswan facilmi kanman.
I just found out that it was.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani chayna kasqanmanta.
So it’s all about it.	Chaymi tukuy imamanta.
I know this can be a difficult time	Yachanim kayqa sasa tiempo kanman
I’m fine with that.	Allinmi kani chaywan.
That month.	Chay killapi.
Then this happened.	Chaymantam kayqa karqa.
That’s what he did right	Chaytan allinta ruwarqan
I've actually never seen it before.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas rikurqanichu ñawpaqtaqa.
He can be sure of that.	Payqa chaymanta seguro kanman.
I should have been happy here	Kaypiqa kusisqam kanay karqa
I think he is the one	Paymi chaytaqa yuyaykuni
Maybe he couldn’t, not yet.	Ichapas mana atirqachu, manaraqmi.
I can't get over how much we did today	Manam atipayta atiymanchu kunan punchaw hayka ruwasqaykumanta
I want to help with that	Chayta yanapayta munani
Now it makes a lot more sense.	Kunanqa aswan achka yuyayniyuqmi.
Not much for him there.	Mana anchatachu paypaq chaypi.
I mean, you were great	Niyta munani, hatunmi karqanki
I'm doing a good job	Allintam ruwachkani
I couldn't do it anymore, I couldn't stand it like that	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu, manam chaynata aguantayta atirqanichu
What do you want from me?.	¿Imatataq ñuqamanta munanki?.
I plan to find him	Payta tariyta yuyaykuni
He doesn’t know why he thought that.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku chayta yuyaykusqanmanta.
I don't know where, but it's here somewhere	Manam yachanichu maypi, ichaqa maypipas kaypim kachkan
Nothing for you there.	Mana imapas qampaq chaypiqa.
That’s all it really does	Chaylla chiqaptapuni ruwan
It’s just going to be.	Chayllam kanqa.
I wanted to know why he did it	Imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
What did he do with it.	¿Imatataq ruwarqa.
He was almost happy here.	Kaypiqa yaqa kusisqa kasqa.
It has a lot of ideas.	Achka yuyayniyuqmi.
He looks fresh and fit.	Payqa musuq hinaspa allin rikchakun.
He was like crazy.	Payqa loco hinam karqa.
I am fine accordingly	Ñuqaqa chayman hina allinmi kani
It was a very big deal	Ancha hatun ruwaymi karqa
Don’t do this to him.	Ama kaytaqa paytaqa ruwaychu.
But this is the future.	Ichaqa kaymi hamuq tiempopi.
I feel like a bad person	Mana allin runa hinam tarikuni
Now creating a new role.	Kunan musuq ruwayta ruwaspa.
But I’m not like you.	Ichaqa manan qan hinachu kani.
No means no.	Mana niyta munan mana.
This is as big as anything else can hold.	Kayqa huk imapas hapiyta atisqanman hina hatunmi.
This way it’s better.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi.
I have to be good now.	Kunanmi allin kanay.
It’s really great.	Chiqamanta hatunmi.
I had no idea what would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna pasananta
Beautiful cold night.	Sumaq chiri tuta.
Even if there is, it may not be the best.	Kaptinpas manapaschá aswan allinchu kanman.
I couldn’t do anything about it, unfortunately	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu chaymantaqa, llakikuypaqmi
Not today, not today.	Mana kunan punchawchu.
I know he is a good man	Yachanim allin runa kasqanta
I can’t stay with you	Manan qanwan qhepakuyta atiymanchu
Is he worth it.	¿Payqa valenchu.
There was no one or nothing	Manam pipas nitaq imapas karqachu
It was always like this.	Sapa kutim kayna karqa.
You can’t do this.	Manan kayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Anyway, this is what happened.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaymi pasarqa.
And very, very quickly.	Hinaspa ancha, ancha utqaylla.
Someone was there.	Pipas chaypi kasqa.
I know you've been hurt in the past	Yachanin ñawpaqpi k'irisqa kasqaykita
You will want to study them later.	Chaykunataqa qhepamanmi estudiayta munanki.
He was very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqachu kasqa.
This was too much for him tonight.	Kayqa kunan tutan paypaq nishuta karqan.
A few weeks ago.	Iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqta.
I found myself here.	Kaypi tarikurqani.
That was, like.	Chayqa karqan, hina.
I mean, it’s right	Allintam niyta munani
What am I doing wrong? 	¿Imatataq mana allinta ruwachkani?
I didn't think about it that way	Manam chaynataqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu
He does the job.	Paymi chay llamkayta ruwan.
He is a stranger again.	Payqa hukmanta mana riqsisqa runam.
It’s pretty big without being too big.	Sumaq hatunmi mana ancha hatun kaspa.
I had no idea what he was doing	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima ruwasqanmanta
Tonight, if you will.	Kunan tuta, munaspaqa.
I know you don't mean anything	Yachanim mana imatapas niyta munasqaykita
No, you know.	Manan, yachanki.
It was clear that this was never going to happen.	Sut’inmi karqan kayqa mana hayk’aqpas pasananta.
It will be there soon enough.	Pisi tiempollamantan chaypi kanqa.
He couldn’t finish the job.	Mana llamkayta tukuyta atirqachu.
I never wished anything but the best for you	Manam haykapipas imatapas munarqanichu aswan allin kaqta qampaq
I want to swim every day	Sapa punchawmi nadayta munani
He doesn’t know where he is.	Payqa manan yachanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t mean it, but it happened	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu, ichaqa chaynatam pasarqa
I did, but it wasn’t enough.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manan chayllachu karqan.
You’ll be there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kanki.
He told me not to go.	Paymi niwarqa ama rinaypaq.
Once, twice, then again.	Huk kuti, iskay kuti, chaymanta yapamanta.
The famous speaker.	Chay riqsisqa rimaq.
Here's a good meal!.	Kaypi allin mikun!.
I was sure it wasn’t going to work	Seguro karqani mana allinchu kananmanta
You know that as well as anyone.	Chaytaqa pipas hina allintam yachanki.
I can’t be like that anymore	Manañam chayna kayta atiymanchu
Please let me know if it is correct.	Ama hina kaspa, allin kasqanmanta willaway.
Some time ago.	Wakin pacha ñawpaqta.
The man did it.	Chay runam chayta ruwarqa.
A little like mine last week	Huk chikan ñuqapa qayna semana hina
This could be one of them.	Kayqa hukninmi kanman.
I knew he was tired	Yacharqanim sayk’usqa kasqanmanta
And then one did.	Hinaspa chaymanta huknin ruwarqa.
That was last week.	Chayqa qayna semanan karqan.
I always listen carefully	Sapa kutim allinta uyarini
He didn’t know you were there.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chaypi kasqaykita.
So far, nothing much good.	Kunankamaqa, mana imapas ancha allinchu.
At the party.	Fiestapi.
There he is, he is. 	Chaypin payqa kashan. 
That’s what this is.	Chayqa kayqa.
They are a.	Paykunaqa huk.
Maybe not today.	Ichapas mana kunan punchawchu.
Maybe no one is there.	Ichapas mana pipas chaypichu kachkan.
I was never happy	Manam haykapipas kusisqachu karqani
He is almost human.	Payqa yaqa runam.
But you know, who knows.	Ichaqa yachanki, pitaq yachan.
I want to go with you	Qanwan riyta munani
I couldn’t get to it.	Manam chayman chayayta atirqanichu.
Tonight is one of them.	Kunan tuta kayqa hukninmi.
I heard a thing or two	Huk iskay imatapas uyarirqanim
I do not agree with this	Kaytaqa manam acuerdopichu kani
But things could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman imapas.
There we are, again.	Chaypim kachkaniku, yapamanta.
I hope to be like him one day	Suyachkani huk punchaw pay hina kayta
I doubt he can sleep right now though	Iskayrayani kunanpacha puñuyta atinman ichaqa
I want to make things better	Imakunatapas aswan allin kananpaqmi ruwayta munani
I had to be sure it would be okay.	Seguro kanay karqan allin kananta.
This wasn't too bad though.	Kayqa manam ancha mana allinchu karqa ichaqa.
They have the same ideas.	Paykunaqa kikin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I’m not quite sure when	Manam allintachu yachani haykapi
You are pretty sure.	Qamqa allin segurom kachkanki.
He’ll be the one.	Payqa kanqa.
Not disappointed, not disappointed.	Mana hukmanyasqa, mana hukmanyasqa.
Otherwise, don’t do it.	Mana chayqa, ama ruwaychu.
So it’s a good thing.	Chaymi allin kaq.
That’s why I have to be fired.	Chayraykum qarqusqa kanay.
I've been doing it for ten years	Chunka watañam chayta ruwachkani
I was a teacher myself	Ñuqapas yachachiq kani
He was a great man.	Huk hatun runam karqa.
But it is a fact.	Ichaqa huk cheqaq kaqmi.
That was surprisingly good.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi allin karqa.
Night on earth.	Kay pachapi tuta.
And so, you have to do something.	Hinaspa chayna, imatapas ruwanayki.
I feel the same way	Ñuqapas chaynatam sientekuni
I had to do this to do it	Kayta ruwanaypaqmi ruwanay karqa
I never want to stop you	Manam haykapipas harkayta munanichu
It’s very good for you.	Ancha allinmi qampaq.
There are a few.	Kanmi huk iskay kimsa.
He can't stop it now.	Manam kunanqa harkayta atinchu.
It did him a lot of good	Achka allintam payta ruwarqa
Now it was ten.	Kunanqa chunka kasqa.
But that is a difficult practical task.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa sasa ruwaypi ruwaymi.
I wasn’t good enough	Ñuqaqa mana allinchu karqani
Explain why you did it.	Willay imarayku ruwasqaykita.
I'm not going to do that tonight	Manam kunan tutaqa chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
I had never heard of him being so upset	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu chayna llakisqa kasqanmantaqa
But everything was so amazing.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I thought it was pretty funny	Ñuqaqa ancha asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani
I can’t say what it’s like	Manam niyta atiymanchu imayna kasqanmantaqa
I’m proud to have played a part in it.	Orgulloso kani chaypi huk ruwayta ruwasqaymanta.
Sure anything in the world.	Seguro imapas kay pachapi.
I can’t do anything right	Manam imatapas allinta ruwayta atiymanchu

They really want to win.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam atipayta munanku.
You have no idea what happened.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki imachus pasasqanmanta.
I couldn’t remember where it was.	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
I can’t be sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa seguro kayta atiymanchu
This morning would be a good time.	Kunan paqarinmi allin tiempo kanman.
I want to go now.	Kunanqa riyta munani.
I can’t wait to do it again!	¡Manan suyayta atiymanchu hukmanta ruwanaypaq!
I am very happy now.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kunanqa.
Maybe he knows now	Ichapas kunan yachan
There should be more people.	Aswan achka runakunam kanan.
But it’s a human being.	Ichaqa runan.
I can’t speak either	Ñuqapas manam rimayta atiymanchu
I don’t care about that	Manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu
But it would be the former.	Ichaqa ñawpaq kaqmi kanman.
You can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atiwaqchu.
I do, but this is very difficult	Ñuqaqa ruwani, ichaqa kayqa ancha sasam
I think that’s going to be great for him	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanqa paypaq, nispan yuyaykuni
I won't be here all summer	Manam kaypichu kasaq tukuy chiri killapi
But he strongly refused.	Ichaqa sinchitan mana munarqanchu.
It looks very much like it.	Anchatam rikchakun.
I couldn’t get anywhere near it	Manam maymanpas chayman chayayta atirqanichu
It would be so much easier.	Ancha aswan facilmi kanman.
I knew they were here	Yacharqanim kaypi kasqankuta
Maybe this was one of them.	Ichapas kayqa huknin karqa.
I thought that was the case.	Chayqa chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I don’t want to believe in anything.	Manam imapipas creeyta munanichu.
I mean that all the time	Chaytaqa sapa kutim niyta munani
Two weeks, maybe.	Iskay semana, ichapas.
I’ll be crazy too.	Ñuqapas loco kasaq.
That thing, however, was not there.	Chay imapas ichaqa manan karqanchu.
But I knew what it was	Ichaqa yacharqanim ima kasqanmanta
You’re not going to be there.	Manam chaypichu kanki.
He was very intelligent.	Payqa ancha yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I can’t really say why	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
Almost never really.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas chiqaptaqa.
I couldn’t eat yet	Manaraqmi mikuyta atirqanichu
I just didn’t know what it was	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
He was the same player.	Payqa kikin pukllaqmi karqan.
A lot of people really aren’t happy about this.	Achka runakuna chiqap mana kusisqachu kaymanta.
I’ll be sure of that	Ñuqaqa chaymanta seguro kasaq
I was tired, so very, very tired	Sayk’usqa karqani, chaymi ancha, ancha sayk’usqa karqani
I didn’t think it could get any worse.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu aswan mana allin kananta.
I never wanted to know.	Manam haykapipas yachayta munarqanichu.
So it should be good.	Chaymi allin kanan.
I hope you did well	Suyachkani allinta ruwasqaykita
I want to know it’s going to be okay	Allinmi kananta yachayta munani
It can’t be that hard.	Mana chay sinchi kayta atinchu.
So it will do some good there.	Chaymi chaypi wakin allinta ruwanqa.
I know how hard it is	Yachanim sinchi sasa kasqanmanta
Never, ever.	Mana hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas.
I can work everything together for good	Tukuy imata kuska allinpaq llamk’ayta atiyman
He’s going to come.	Paymi hamunqa.
He talked a lot.	Payqa achkatam rimaq.
I was sure there was no more	Seguro karqani manaña aswan kasqanmanta
I really have no choice	Chiqaptaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu
That’s obviously the case here.	Chayqa sut’inmi kaypi kashan.
You know that from me.	Chaytaqa ñoqamanta yachanki.
I wanted to ask her again	Hukmanta tapuyta munarqani
Otherwise it would have been better	Mana chayqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan
You look amazing!.	¡Admirakuypaqmi rikchakunki!.
I want to hear it all	Tukuy chayta uyariyta munani
But they are beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanku.
Soon again again.	Pisi tiempollamantan yapamanta.
I can’t be that smart	Manam chayna yachaysapa kayta atiymanchu
I made a cup of coffee	Huk kukata ruwarqani
A man scared and angry	Huk runa mancharisqa, phiñasqa ima
Do it without doing anything.	Mana imatapas ruwaspa ruway.
I’m not really ready.	Manam chiqaptachu listo kachkani.
I can do it tomorrow	Paqarin punchawmi ruwayta atiyman
I can’t talk to anyone about it	Manam chaymantaqa piwanpas rimayta atiymanchu
I can’t wait for it!.	¡Manan suyayta atiymanchu!.
But he could not understand it.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa entiendeyta atirqanchu.
I know there is no better way	Yachanim mana aswan allinqa kasqanmanta
I thought things were good	Imapas allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
And I saw it.	Hinan chayta rikurqani.
I said it was sad	Llakikuypaqmi nispaymi nirqani
I really want to live here.	Chiqamanta kaypi tiyayta munani.
I couldn’t stop talking about you	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu qammanta rimayta
He was hungry.	Payqa yarqaymanta kasqa.
I didn’t want to talk to him either	Ñoqapas manan paywan rimayta munarqanichu
So it’s going to come.	Chaymi hamunqa.
I knew there was something there	Yacharqanim imapas chaypi kasqanmanta
I know you want to see it	Yachanim qawayta munasqaykita
He is, indeed he is.	Payqa kanmi, cheqaqtapunin kan.
It sounds very unpleasant.	Ancha mana sumaqmi uyarikun.
I can't find a way to fix it.	Manam tarinichu imayna allichayta.
He didn’t quite know why.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imarayku.
I couldn’t tell you about it	Manam chaymantaqa willayta atirqanichu
I can't take this	Kaytaqa manam hapiyta atiymanchu
I wasn't sure which one it was.	Manam allintachu yacharqani mayqin kasqanmantaqa.
I never knew they were real	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chiqap kasqankuta
I don't know what's wrong anymore.	Manañam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I could never give up	Manam haykapipas saqiyta atirqanichu
I still don’t see it	Kunankamapas manam rikunichu
I wish I knew where he is now	Munaymanmi kunan maypi kasqanmanta yachayta
I was tired of that feeling	Sayk’usqañan karqani chay sientekusqanmanta
He was such a great guy.	Payqa chayna hatun runam karqa.
After some time.	Huk tiempo qhepaman.
I’m really scared.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa kachkani.
This is doubly so.	Kayqa iskay kutita chayman rikchakun.
I'm so sick and tired of it.	Ancha unqusqa, sayk'usqa ima kani chaymanta.
I really want to be like that	Chiqaptam munani chayna kayta
I meant it yesterday	Qayna punchawmi niyta munarqani
He wasn't sure of anything anymore.	Manañam imamantapas segurochu kasqa.
I wonder who in the world he is	Tapukunitaqmi kay pachapi pi kasqanmanta
I’m not very good at it	Manam ancha allinchu kani
It was too, too fast.	Llumpay, ancha utqayllam karqa.
It was very quick and fast	Ancha utqaylla hinaspa utqayllam karqa
He didn’t know what was going on.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
I want this house to be yours and mine	Kay wasi qampaq, ñuqapaq ima kananta munani
I want to wait a while	Huk rato suyayta munani
It will be a new world.	Mosoq pacha kanqa.
He couldn’t do anything right.	Payqa manan imatapas allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He was going to do it.	Payqa chayta ruwananpaqmi kasqa.
I was immediately disappointed.	Chayllam hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
That’s the only thing.	Chaylla imapas.
I thought it would be good	Allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
That’s why these people are here.	Chayraykum kay runakunaqa kaypi kachkan.
But there will be a day.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi kanqa.
I had never heard of that before	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu
I had no idea what it was	Manam piensarqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t know how good you were.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna allin kasqaykita.
I can’t believe you didn’t	Manam creeyta atiymanchu mana ruwasqaykita
I didn't really think you were serious before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam chiqaptachu piensarqani serio kasqaykita
I knew this was coming.	Yacharqanim kay hamunanta.
Very sad indeed.	Ancha llakisqa chiqap.
I never wanted someone like this	Manam haykapipas kayna pitapas munarqanichu
He doesn’t say that.	Payqa manan chaytachu nin.
Do it now.	Kunan ruway.
I think they were hungry	Yuyaykuni yarqasqa kasqankuta
I'll go again.	Yapamanta risaq.
I couldn’t remember why	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
Which was very interesting.	Imataq ancha sumaq karqa.
I want to be good at something	Imapipas allin kaytam munani
I couldn't tell him anything anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam imatapas willayta atirqanichu
I know, you could have done better	Yachanim, aswan allintam ruwawaq karqa
One would like to believe that it is	Runaqa chhayna kasqanpi creeyta munanman
No one wants to talk about it.	Manam pipas chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
I never meant to say that	Manam haykapipas chaynata niyta munarqanichu
But it looked good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Yes, everything.	Arí, tukuy imapas.
I just couldn’t tell.	Chaylla mana yachayta atirqanichu.
I really do, you know.	Chiqaptam ruwani, yachanki.
He said he felt good.	Paymi nirqa allinta sientekusqanmanta.
I know there are more	Yachanim aswan achka kasqanmanta
I feel so much better now.	Kunanqa ancha allintam tarikuni.
Therefore, they are.	Chayraykum paykunaqa.
I felt frustrated and sad	Hukmanyasqa hinaspa llakisqa tarikurqani
Now they are available.	Kunanqa paykunaqa kanmi.
If you are, say so.	Sichus kanki chayqa, niy.
Being one of everything in the world.	Kay pachapi tukuy imamanta huk kay.
No, not at all.	Manan, manan ni imapipas.
Unless, of course, that someone is you.	Mana chayqa, sut’inmi, chay pipas qan kanki chayqa.
This is what he does all the time.	Chay ruwasqanqa sapa kutillanmi.
Humanity is better off with it now.	Runa kayqa aswan allinmi kunan chaywan.
That’s what he told me.	Chayta niwarqa.
It was a perfect evening.	Chayqa karqan allin ch’isi.
Maybe it’s just that.	Ichapas chaylla kanman.
I had no time for anything	Manam imapaqpas tiempoy karqachu
But I knew what he meant	Ichaqa yacharqanim ima niyta munasqanmanta
In a way, this is a good thing.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, kayqa allinmi.
I think of this.	Kayta yuyaykuni.
He doesn’t have to do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwananchu.
You’re going to be fine, he says.	Allinmi kanki, nispas nin.
He’s anything but that.	Payqa imapas ichaqa chaymanta.
I take that as a yes.	Chaytaqa arí hinam hapini.
I had no idea he felt that way	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chhayna sientekusqanmanta
It doesn’t matter, man.	Manam imananpaschu, runa.
This could be me.	Kayqa ñuqam kanman.
I knew something bad was going to happen this morning	Yacharqanim kunan paqarin imapas mana allin pasananta
I actually have that as a problem	Chiqaptaqa chaytam sasachakuy hina kani
I never wanted to do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu
It takes a lot sometimes, really.	Achkatam necesitan wakin kuti, chiqaptam.
These are the first.	Kaykunaqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
I haven’t been for two years	Iskay watañam mana rirqanichu
He was the first one.	Payqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
I don’t know how it happened	Manam yachanichu imayna pasasqanmanta
I was there most of the day.	Yaqa tukuy punchaw chaypi karqani.
We did it one night.	Huk tutan chayta ruwarqayku.
I need more but I can’t find it anywhere.	Astawan necesitasaq ichaqa manan maypipas tarinichu.
Nothing easy about it.	Mana imapas facilchu chaymanta.
He can’t see it, of course.	Payqa manan rikuyta atinchu, sut’inmi.
I really wanted to leave.	Anchatam ripuyta munarqani.
I knew it wouldn't happen soon	Yacharqanim mana chayllachu pasananta
I probably thought things were right here	Kaypiqa yaqapaschá imapas allin kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani
So here’s how it is.	Chaymi kaypi imayna kasqanmanta.
A drunk person does not know that this is the case	Machasqa runaqa manam yachanchu chayna kasqanmanta
I didn’t really know what they were like	Manam allintachu yacharqani imayna kasqankuta
I really wish this wouldn't happen.	Chiqaptam munani kay mana pasananta.
He doesn’t deserve to be in jail.	Payqa manan carcelpi kananpaq hinachu.
I still think I like him	Hinallam piensani pay gustasqanmanta
I think he feels guilty	Yuyaykuni huchayoq sientekusqanmanta
I can't understand what he says half the time.	Manam entiendeyta atinichu kuskan kutipi ima nisqanmanta.
I can’t answer anything	Manam imatapas kutichiyta atiymanchu
I really couldn't be happier	Chiqaptaqa manam aswan kusisqachu kayman karqa
I definitely agreed.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam arí nirqani.
I was really, really stupid.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam sonso karqani.
Yes, it can be.	Arí chayna kanman.
I did a lot of wrong things.	Achka mana allintam ruwarqani.
I have no idea who he is	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani pi kasqanmantaqa
Yes, he was alone.	Arí, sapallanmi karqa.
He should be long gone.	Payqa unayñan kanan.
I had no reason to do that.	Manam imaraykupas chayta ruwanaypaqqa karqachu.
This whole time.	Kay tukuy pacha.
I don't do much here.	Kaypiqa manam anchatachu ruwani.
Which would be terrible.	Imataq manchay kanman.
You have no idea it happened.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki chay pasasqanmanta.
No, this wouldn’t be right.	Manan, kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
They were happy with it.	Chaywanmi kusisqa karqanku.
I always wanted to do more than that	Sapa kutim chaymanta astawan ruwayta munarqani
Not really me, anyway.	Mana chiqap ñuqachu, imayna kaptinpas.
I never saw it coming.	Manam haykapipas hamunanta rikurqanichu.
I wanted to know what he was doing	Chay ruwasqanmanta yachayta munarqani
I don’t know how else to describe the feeling	Mana yachanichu imaynata hukmanta willayta chay sientekusqanmanta
He gave me everything.	Tukuy imatam quwarqa.
It’s not good, but it’s not really bad, either.	Manan allinchu, ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu mana allinchu, nitaq.
He knows how to do what he wants.	Payqa yachanmi munasqanman hina ruwayta.
I can't believe you are	Manam creeyta atiymanchu chayna kasqaykita
The process took a week.	Chay ruwayqa huk semanan karqan.
Very.	Ancha.
I know he wants to play	Yachanim pukllayta munasqanmanta
Probably too soon.	Yaqapaschá ancha utqaylla.
Which is good really.	Imataq allinmi chiqaptapuni.
I didn't think it was	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
You are amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanki.
I thought it would be time	Tiempo kananta yuyaykurqani
I don’t see it anymore.	Manañam rikunichu.
I have to be happy.	Kusisqam kanay.
Yes, it was a bad night.	Arí, mana allin tutam karqa.
I still know it today.	Kunankamapas yachanim.
I knew it would happen	Yacharqanim chayna pasananta
It’s cold out here.	Kay hawapi chiri.
Not the first time, at least.	Mana ñawpaq kutichu, aswanpas.
I knew it was going for good	Yacharqanim allinpaq risqanmanta
There is no point in it.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​chaypiqa.
He was tired of it.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan chaymanta.
That would be a foolish thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi kanman.
Even if it’s not that funny.	Mana chayna asikunapaq kaptinpas.
I always wanted to be alone	Sapa kutim sapallay kayta munarqani
I always wanted to be with him more	Sapa kutim astawan paywan kayta munarqani
I should have done this a long time ago	Kaytaqa unayñam ruwanay karqa
I probably wouldn’t go anyway	Manachá imayna kaptinpas risaqchu
I did what anyone could	Pipas atisqanman hinam ruwarqani
I don’t see this letter.	Manam kay cartata rikunichu.
I’m glad it’s good.	Kusikuni allin kasqanmanta.
I don't want that either	Ñoqapas manan munanichu chaytaqa, nispa
Not well-regarded.	Mana allin qhawarisqa.
I hadn’t been there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu karqani.
We are now.	Kunanmi kanchik.
But it wasn’t difficult.	Ichaqa manan sasachu karqan.
That didn't work out.	Chayqa mana allintachu lluqsirqa.
There will be nothing left.	Manañam imapas kanqachu.
It’s never a good thing.	Manam haykapipas allinchu.
I never wanted to do that.	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwaytaqa munarqanichu.
He wanted to tell her everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam willayta munarqa.
For the first time for him.	Ñawpaq kutita paypaq.
I couldn’t let that moment just happen	Manam chay rato chaylla pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
I know you really do like him	Yachanim chiqaptapuni pay hina ruwasqaykita
I know you want it to be different.	Yachanim huk hina kananta munasqaykita.
I had this idea that he was probably scared	Kay yuyayniyuqmi karqani, yaqapaschá mancharisqa kasqanmanta
I can’t beat him.	Manam paytaqa atipayta atiymanchu.
I doubt it happened that night	Iskayrayani chay tuta pasasqanmanta
I could never say that	Manam haykapipas chayta niyta atirqanichu
No one can tell you this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas willayta atinmanchu.
I want to be with you longer	Aswan unayta qanwan kayta munani
Instead, he walked home alone.	Aswanpas sapallanmi wasinman puriq.
Otherwise, it’s great.	Mana chayqa, ancha allinmi.
I wonder who the newcomer might be.	Tapukuni pitaq kanman chay musuq hamuq.
It’s not easy, this is for sure.	Manam facilchu, kayqa segurom.
I haven’t felt this good in a very long time	Ancha unayñan mana kay allintachu sientekuni

Today that pipe me.	Kunan punchaw chay pipas ñuqa.

What are they like.	Imaynataq kanku.
I’m not ready for that yet	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi listochu kani
Whatever your appearance is.	Imayna rikchayniyuq kanki.
They’re not here.	Manam kaypichu kachkanku.
Easy to say, very hard to do.	Facil niyta, ancha sasa ruway.
I hadn’t heard of it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanichu
It’s okay with me.	Ñuqawanqa allinmi.
I can’t tell you how good it is for him	Manam niyta atiymanchu paypaq imayna allin kasqanmanta
I have no idea where to go from here	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani kaymanta mayman rinaypaq
A few months, at least	Iskay kimsa killa, aswanpas
I couldn’t think of anything.	Manam imatapas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I heard someone say.	Pipas nisqanta uyarirqani.
I was happy for no reason.	Mana imaraykupas kusisqam karqani.
What is this about.	Imamantataq kay.
He just passed away.	Payqa chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
I never want to leave	Manam haykapipas ripuyta munanichu
However, it is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, manan allinchu.
The hidden secret.	Chay pakasqa pakasqa kaqta.
It happened recently.	Chayllaraqmi chayta pasarqa.
I am very sorry about this	Kaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni
This is certainly a good thing.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa allin.
I just didn’t want to talk	Chaylla mana rimayta munarqanichu
I didn’t know what to do or say	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwanayta nitaq ima niyta
Then another, then another, then another.	Chaymanta huk, chaymanta huk, chaymanta huk.
It’s a very difficult month	Ancha sasa killa
Happily not.	Kusisqam mana.
I couldn’t see where I was going	Manam rikurqanichu mayman rinaypaq

No, no, not really.	Manan, manan, cheqaqtachu.
Then again and again.	Chaymanta yapamanta yapamanta.
I am very sorry to say	Anchatam llakikuni niyta
He was not alone here.	Kaypiqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
I doubt this is the case in the summer	Iskayrayani kay hina kasqanmanta chiri killapi
No, he does exist.	Manan, payqa kanmi.
I didn’t listen to him much	Manam anchatachu paytaqa uyarirqani
He refused though.	Payqa manan munarqanchu ichaqa.
I’ve always been very serious	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ancha serio karqani
A lot of black.	Achka yana.
This night time.	Kay tuta pacha.

People there that.	Runakuna chaypi chay.
You said it.	Qanmi nirqanki.
This is a very common practice.	Kayqa ancha riqsisqa ruwaymi.
So far, everything has been fine so far.	Kunankamaqa kunankamaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I don’t think that was easy	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan, nispaymi yuyaykuni
Probably, maybe.	Yaqapaschá, ichapas.
I thought it would be good	Allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani
I wasn’t the nicest person	Manam aswan sumaq runachu karqani
I couldn't take it	Manam chaytaqa hapiyta atirqanichu
I really enjoy doing it	Chiqamanta kusikuni chayta ruwaspa
Really good design and does what it’s supposed to do.	Chiqamanta allin ruway hinaspa ruwan imatachus ruwanan tiyan.
But nobody said you can’t do this.	Ichaqa manan pipas nirqanchu kaytaqa manan ruwayta atiwaqchu nispa.
I could never tell	Manam haykapipas willayta atirqanichu
Don’t ever be that person.	Ama hayk’aqpas chay runa hina kaychu.

I overdid everything	Tukuy imatam llumpayta ruwarqani
I want to be him.	Pay kaytam munani.
But he doesn't know anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
I never knew who they were	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pikuna kasqankuta
So that’s the one.	Chaymi chaymi chay.
But that was three weeks ago.	Ichaqa chayqa kinsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
He doesn’t like it.	Payqa manam gustanchu.
I feel so happy and excited	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam tarikuni
I can’t be that person	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu
What is the world.	Imataq kay pacha.

I mean, how was he	Niyta munani, imaynataq payqa karqa
Of course, he knows every answer.	Arí, payqa yachanmi sapa kutichiyta.

So he’s there.	Chaymi payqa chaypi kachkan.
I want to know who he is	Pi kasqanmanta yachayta munani
But that’s not all it does.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu chayta ruwan.
It’s really hard.	Chiqaptam sasa.
Everything other than that was really good.	Tukuy imapas huk chaymanta chay chiqap allin karqa.
I don't want to see this, ever	Manam kayta qawayta munanichu, haykapipas
What do you do though anyway.	Imatataq ruwanki ichaqa imayna kaptinpas.

That he wouldn’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwananmanta.
I can usually do that	Yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa ruwayman
It’s not beauty.	Manam sumaq kaychu.
I'm so tired and hungry.	Ancha sayk'usqa, yarqasqa ima kani.
But it’s not that funny	Ichaqa manan chay hina asikunapaq hinachu
I can do better	Aswan allintam ruwayman
I think he was disappointed in me	Piensani ñoqamanta hukmanyasqa kasqanpi
I can’t go anymore	Manañam riyta atiymanchu
And herein lies the problem.	Hinaspa kaypim kachkan chay sasachakuy.
Be nice otherwise.	Sumaq kay mana chayqa.
They know it’s going to happen.	Chayna kananta yachanku.
Okay, today was a black day.	Allinmi, kunan punchawqa yana punchawmi karqa.
I know this is the best thing for me	Yachanim kayqa ñuqapaq aswan allin kasqanmanta
I was happy there	Chaypiqa kusisqam tarikurqani
I want this as badly as you do	Kaytaqa qan hina mana allintan munani
I had no intention of being serious with anyone	Manam piwanpas serio kayta yuyaykurqanichu
I didn’t want to sing all night, anyway	Manam tukuy tuta takiyta munarqanichu, imayna kaptinpas
I have always thought this	Kaytaqa sapa kutim piensarqani
It shouldn’t be too difficult, he said.	Manam ancha sasachu kanan, nispas nin.
He didn't know what it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to play anymore.	Manañam pukllayta munarqanichu.
I doubt anyone has.	Iskayrayani pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I can’t do anything else	Manam hukta ruwayta atiymanchu
We are two smart people here.	Kaypiqa iskay yachaysapa runakunam kayku.
I do it every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaytaqa ruwani.
Most of the summer.	Yaqa llapan chiri killa.
I just didn’t want to know about it.	Chaylla mana chaymanta yachayta munarqanichu.
One of them will be yours.	Hukninmi qampaq kanqa.
He did this several times.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwarqan.
I felt a little silly	Huk chikan mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqani
Three thirty in the morning.	Kimsa kimsa chunka tutamanta.
I am looking forward to time with him	Ñuqaqa anchatam suyachkani paywan tiempota
Maybe for a long time.	Ichapas unayta.
I’ll be here all night	Tukuy tutan kaypi kasaq
And it was very nice.	Hinaspa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But there is one.	Ichaqa hukninmi kan.
Maybe like you.	Ichapas qam hina.
He does this a few times a day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi iskay kimsa kutita ruwan.
He knows he has to go.	Payqa yachanmi rinan kasqanmanta.
But now he can’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan atinchu.
This makes some sense.	Kayqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi.
He was quite the man.	Payqa allintam chay runa karqa.
There is.	Kanmi.
I can’t say what it is.	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmantaqa.
But that’s pretty much it.	Ichaqa chayqa yaqa hinan.
But it was today.	Ichaqa kunan p’unchaymi karqan.
He can’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
I was really on my own now	Chiqaptam kunanqa sapallay karqani
Let’s wait a little longer.	Huk chhikanta suyasun.
I still don't feel right	Kunankamapas manam allintachu sientekuni
He immediately left.	Chaylla saqirqa.
He is here with us every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi kaypi ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
I wish you were here with me now	Munaymanmi kunan kaypi ñoqawan kasqaykita
Okay, they were good.	Allinmi, paykunaqa allinmi karqaku.
I’m glad he’s here	Kusikuni kaypi kasqanmanta
That would have been huge.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi kanman karqa.
But he knew it well.	Ichaqa allintan yacharqan.
The people were angry.	Chay runakunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
I am so happy for you.	Anchatam kusikuni qampaq.
So it’s known.	Chaymi riqsisqa.
I didn’t know who was which	Manam yacharqanichu pi mayqin kasqanmanta
I wish I could talk to him	Munaymanmi karqa paywan rimayta
I hadn't thought about it until now	Kunankamaqa manam chaypiqa piensarqanichu
It’s not going to get any worse than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan mana allinchu kanqa.
Maybe he’s ready to face it.	Ichapas payqa listoña kachkan chayta atipananpaq.
He wanted to tell her.	Payqa willayta munarqa.
And then more, more more more.	Hinaspa chaymanta aswan, aswan aswan aswan.
I think that’s not an easy thing to do	Chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
Everything seemed to be in order.	Tukuy imapas allinpaq hinam karqa.
I was happy with you here	Kaypi qanwan kuska kusisqa karqani
He looked back.	Qhepamanmi qhawarirqan.
I had no idea what it was	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu karqani ima kasqanmantaqa
Everyone looks so nice.	Lliwmi ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq.
This was the great chance.	Kaymi karqan hatun chansa.
It’s a good thing for me.	Allinmi ñuqapaq.
I’m just like him, too.	Ñuqapas pay hinam kani.
You want work from me you do here.	Munanki llamk’ayta ñuqamanta qam kaypi ruway.
Maybe I should do it again and again	Ichapas yapamanta yapamanta ruwanay kanman
I was fine with it.	Ñuqaqa allinmi karqani.
I didn’t want to go out there	Manam chayman lluqsiyta munarqanichu
I think he’ll be fine now	Kunanqa allinmi kanqa, nispan yuyaykuni
I might have an idea	Ichapas huk yuyayniyuq kayman
This is not a good practice.	Kay ruwayqa manam allinchu.
I am like a different person now.	Kunanqa huk runa hinam kani.
I couldn’t hear it anymore	Manañam uyariyta atirqanichu
Instead, he kept going.	Aswanpas payqa hinallam rirqa.
After all, they’re human.	Tukuy imamanta, paykunaqa runa kanku.

There was none after that.	Chay qhepamanmi mana karqanchu.
Obviously, he was right.	Sut’inmi, payqa allintan rimarqan.
I thought you couldn’t	Mana atisqaykita yuyaykurqani
I don’t know what it is yet	Manaraqmi yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
Not sure about that.	Mana segurochu chaymanta.
That's very probably true.	Chayqa ancha ichapas chiqap kanman.
I didn’t really know whether to be happy or sad	Manam allintachu yacharqani kusisqa utaq llakisqa kanaypaq
I don’t see why it wouldn’t work.	Manam rikunichu imarayku mana allinchu kanman chayta.
That is why I think they are friends	Chayraykum amigontin kasqankuta piensani
I hope, you are very happy here	Suyachkani, kaypi ancha kusisqa kasqaykita
Maybe you want to check it out.	Ichapas qawayta munanki.
I think you’re doing the right thing.	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqaykita.
I know it won't happen though.	Yachanim ichaqa mana pasananta.
It would have been great.	Hatunmi kanman karqa.
I feel good about it	Chaywanmi allinta sientekuni
I, however, want to play this	Ñuqam ichaqa kayta pukllayta munani
I know you want to do that	Yachanim chayta ruwayta munasqaykita
I heard the name of one of his men	Uyarirqanim huknin runan sutinta
I think that’s the best way to do that.	Yuyaykuni chay ruwayqa aswan allin kanman chayta ruwanapaq.
I didn’t see any other way.	Manam huk ñanta rikurqanichu.
I think about how crazy this is	Kay imayna loco kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
I knew he wouldn't	Yacharqanim mana chayta ruwananta
Maybe he’s sick.	Ichapas payqa unqusqa.
I couldn’t hear anything else	Manañam imatapas uyariyta atirqanichu
I would love to know where it is	Anchatan munani maypi kasqanmanta yachayta
This seems good, but it is not good.	Kayqa allinmi rikchakun, ichaqa manam allinchu.
What is true today was true last week.	Kunan punchaw chiqap kaqmi qayna semana chiqap karqa.
Can't walk, you know.	Mana puriyta atinchu, yachanki.
I know it's mine	Yachanim ñuqapa kasqanmanta
So, yes,.	Chaymi, arí,.
He was there to do the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi chaypi karqa.
But it’s clear what he’s saying.	Ichaqa sut’inmi imachus nisqanmanta.
I don’t want to be guilty	Manam munanichu huchayoq kasqayta
And that’s just me.	Hinaspa chayqa ñuqallam.
This he could not do.	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atirqachu.
I am inclined to agree	Ñuqapas chaytam acuerdopi kayta munani
It was not worth it.	Manam chay ruwayqa valenchu ​​karqa.
In this very house.	Kay kikin wasipi.
I went to the back.	Qhepamanmi rirqani.
I mean, he does it all the time.	Niyta munani, payqa tukuy tiempon chayta ruwan.
I can’t leave the money	Manam qullqita saqiyta atiymanchu
You're not really that scared.	Manam chiqaptachu chayna mancharisqa kachkanki.
Really, really late.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta tarde.
I wonder where that might be	Maypitaq chay kanman chayta tapukuni
I mean, what had to be done, had to be done.	Niyta munani, imachus ruwana karqa, ruwana karqa.
But I did it right.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwarqani.
She never wanted him.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa munarqanchu.
There is nothing we can do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atichwanchu.
But you may not want to try too many new things.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana munankichu askha mosoq ruwaykunata ruwayta.
Everything will be fine for you here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa qampaq.
Yes, it is a great success.	Arí, hatun allin ruwaymi.
But he was there.	Ichaqa paymi chaypi kasharqan.
He is very quick.	Payqa ancha utqayllam.
I was very good at it	Chaypiqa ancha allinmi karqani
He is like a house.	Payqa wasi hinam.
And we’re angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kayku.
Not so sure what's so funny.	Mana ancha segurochu imakuna ancha asikunapaq kasqanmanta.
And it was very, very difficult.	Hinaspa ancha, ancha sasa karqa.
I couldn’t see where	Manam rikuyta atirqanichu maypi
I have done this several times.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwarqani.
And he's right.	Hinaspa payqa allintam nin.
There's no one here, he said.	Kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu, nispas nisqa.
I was in a hurry.	Ñuqaqa utqayllam karqani.
He knew things.	Payqa imakunatapas yacharqanmi.
He sounds strange.	Payqa mana riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
First, you can do this in advance.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayta ruwawaq.
It won’t be here.	Manam kaypichu kanqa.
I didn’t really think this through	Kaytaqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani
I wasn’t good for anything	Manam imapaqpas allinchu karqani
But here it is very difficult.	Ichaqa kaypiqa ancha sasam.
Soon you will be with him.	Pisi tiempollamantan paywan kanki.
I couldn't ignore that	Chaytaqa manam mana uyariyta atirqanichu
It’s been a couple of years.	Iskay kimsa watañam.
Maybe I can do that	Ichapas chayta ruwayta atiyman
But please don’t be.	Ichaqa ama hina kaspa ama kaychu.
But now they are very good.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha allinmi kanku.
More on this please.	Astawan kaymanta ama hina kaspa.
I can't do this now	Kunanqa manam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
He started going every night.	Payqa sapa tutam riyta qallaykurqa.
I couldn’t resist it anymore	Manañan chayta hark’ayta atirqanichu
They have always been.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqaku.
I can’t be this, it won’t be	Manam kayta atiymanchu, manam kanqachu
I wonder what happens next	Chay qhepamanmi imachus kanqa nispa tapukuni
Yes, he thinks.	Arí, payqa yuyaykun.
He was in deep distress at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
Maybe he knew.	Ichapas yacharqa.
He told her not to do it.	Mana ruwananpaq nisqa.
It was the big guy from the night before.	Chay hatun runam karqa ñawpaq tutamanta.
And act accordingly.	Hinaspa chayman hina ruway.
I know he is good at what he does	Yachanim ruwasqanpi allin kasqanmanta
Let me know if there is a better way to do it.	Aswan allin ruway kaptinqa willaway.
I used to do this too.	Ñuqapas kaytam ruwaq kani.
First of all, it’s the name.	Ñawpaqtaqa, sutinmi.
But everyone knows it.	Ichaqa llapallankum yachanku.
I wish it wasn't.	Munaymanmi mana chayna kaptinqa.
But, here is the problem.	Ichaqa, kaypim sasachakuy kachkan.
And it sure did the job.	Hinaspa seguro chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
I know nothing about that	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu
He couldn’t walk.	Payqa manan puriyta atirqanchu.
In fact it happened all the time.	Chiqaptaqa sapa kutim pasarqa.
Be proud and be happy!.	¡Orgulloso kay hinaspa kusisqa kay!.
But one could never be sure.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas huk runaqa seguro kayta atirqanchu.
Three nights this week, three nights a week ago.	Kimsa tuta kay semanapi, kimsa tuta semana ñawpaqta.
He must act quickly to do so.	Chaypaqqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan.
I didn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu.
Perhaps other people are.	Yaqapaschá huk runakunaqa chayna.
Whether that will happen is nobody knows.	Chayna kanqa icha manachu chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
But it was more than one.	Ichaqa hukmanta aswan hatunmi karqan.
In fact, he didn’t think about what he was doing.	Aswanpas, manan yuyaykurqanchu chay ruwasqanpi.
I didn’t do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwarqani.
Yes, he wanted to do that.	Arí, chayta ruwayta munarqa.
But then a funny thing happened.	Ichaqa chaymantam huk asikunapaq kaq pasarqa.
I am very serious about this	Kaymantaqa anchatam serio kani
The result was remarkable	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi karqa
He just said it tonight.	Chayllaraqmi kunan tuta nisqa.
I have two opinions.	Iskay yuyayniyuqmi kani.
This seems a little out there.	Kayqa huk chhikanta hawaman rikch’akun.
No one thinks anything of it.	Manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas yuyaykunchu.
Yes, you do it.	Arí, qanmi ruwanki.
He is, of course, known for everything.	Payqa, chiqamanta, tukuy imamanta riqsisqa kachkan.
I’m so excited	Anchatan kusikuni
And then we did it again, again and again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta ruwarqayku, yapamanta yapamanta.
Boy, that thing is huge.	Wayna, chay imapas hatunmi.
He didn’t do it right.	Mana allintam ruwarqa.
I have done this several times	Kaytaqa achka kutitam ruwarqani
It’s not the way he says it is.	Manam imayna nisqanman hinachu.
By doing something.	Imatapas ruwaspa.
I can’t really do much else	Manam chiqaptaqa huk achkata ruwayta atiymanchu
I know how to play the game	Pukllayta yachani
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka.
I had no idea what had happened to him	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
Which could be a problem.	Imataq sasachakuy kanman.
I certainly wasn’t happy	Cheqaqtapunin mana kusisqachu karqani
Learn from me.	Ñoqamanta yachay.
I didn’t want to talk about this anymore	Manañam kaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu
I doubt anyone said that	Iskayrayani pipas chayna nisqanmanta
This requires mindfulness.	Kayqa yuyayniyuq kayta munan.
She refused to see him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu payta rikuyta.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Allinmi kanman, mana allinchu kanman.
I was a very lonely person	Ancha sapallan runam karqani
Or so he said.	Utaq chaynatam nirqa.
Explain why the recent events occurred.	Willay imanasqa chayllaraq imapas pasasqanmanta.
I know how it happened	Yachanim imayna pasasqanmanta
Man, but he wasn’t there.	Runa, ichaqa manan chaypichu karqan.
Something is great.	Imapas hatunmi.
I had no idea he did most of it	Manam yuyaykurqanichu yaqa llapan ruwasqanmanta
He had it with him the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chayta paywan kasharqan.
I could have done one.	Ñuqaqa hukta ruwayta atiyman karqan.
But I’m worse off	Ichaqa aswan mana allinchu kani
I don’t want to know that	Manam chayta yachayta munanichu
I can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t do it anymore	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu
But he knew how she felt.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I know what you will do with it	Yachanim chaywan imata ruwanaykita
I want to do the next one	Qatiqnin ruwayta munani
I can talk to you later	Qhepamanmi qanwan rimayta atiyman
He meant something by it.	Chaywanmi imatapas niyta munarqa.
Here it is again.	Kaypim yapamanta kachkan.
I can do a lot for you.	Achkatam qampaq ruwayta atiyman.
He seriously doesn’t know who he is.	Payqa serio mana yachanchu pi kasqanmanta.
Very, very happy.	Ancha, ancha kusisqa.
It couldn’t be worse.	Mana aswan mana allinchu kanman.
So far I am a terrible person.	Kunankamaqa manchay runam kani.
The following week.	Qatiqnin semanapi.
I thought he did some really good stuff.	Yuyarqanim wakin chiqap allin ruwaykunata ruwasqanmanta.
Better food, better everything.	Aswan allin mikhuy, aswan allin tukuy ima.
For some reason, that makes me feel better.	Imaraykupas chaywanqa aswan allintam sientekuni.
He was a man who had to do something.	Payqa huk runan karqan, paymi imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I want to learn another language	Huk simita yachayta munani
I was one of them	Huk kaqmi karqani
I know you are better than this	Yachanim kaymanta aswan allin kasqaykita
I’m exhausted by now.	Kunankamaqa sayk’usqañan kashani.
Wealth itself takes time.	Kikin qhapaq kayqa tiempon.
But I couldn’t sleep	Ichaqa manan puñuyta atirqanichu
Three days a week.	Semanapi kimsa punchaw.
Not today, not ever.	Mana kunan punchawchu, mana haykapipas.
I will act like a good man	Allin runa hinam ruwasaq
Do something about it.	Imatapas ruway.
I know she can handle him.	Yachanim payta aguantayta atisqanmanta.
I just know that you are	Chaylla yachani chayna kasqaykita
In fact, this is not always the case.	Chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu chayna.
Tell me what you don’t know.	Mana yachasqaykita willaway.
He talked to her all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim paywan rimaq.
Bad and bad.	Mana allin hinaspa mana allin.
I certainly can’t.	Chiqamanta mana atiymanchu.
I foolishly wanted it	Mana yuyayniyuqmi chaytaqa munarqani
Pretty silly act	Allin mana yuyayniyuq ruway
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqawan karqa.
Maybe it’s not a good thing.	Ichapas mana allinchu kanman.
One is easy.	Hukninmi facil.
I can't watch this	Kaytaqa manam qawayta atiymanchu
I don't remember what the problem was	Manam yuyarinichu ima sasachakuy kasqanmantaqa
He wants to be there.	Payqa chaypi kaytam munan.
I could barely see it	Yaqa mana rikuyta atirqanichu
After that is the truth.	Chay qhepamanmi cheqaq kaq.
I have no idea how to do this.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
And he was angry.	Hinan payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t really want to go there	Manam anchatachu chayman riyta munarqani
I can't wait to do it again	Manam suyayta atinichu hukmanta ruwanaypaq
We need to do the right thing here.	Kaypiqa allintam ruwananchik.
It seemed too late for that.	Chaypaqqa ancha tarde hinam karqa.
I wasn’t that person	Manam chay runachu karqani
These are serious people.	Kaykunaqa serio runakunam.
He has been around for a year now.	Kunanqa huk watañam kachkan.
I couldn't wait to talk to you	Manam suyayta atirqanichu qamwan rimanaypaq
That would have been stupid.	Chayqa sonso kaymi kanman karqa.
But he’s such a young man.	Ichaqa chay hina wayna.
I don’t really see it.	Manam chiqaptaqa rikunichu.
I knew everything was going to be hard, really, really hard.	Yacharqanim tukuy imapas sasa kananta, chiqaptapuni, chiqap sasa kananta.
Man, it’s been a long time.	Runa, unayñam.
Everyone but himself.	Llapa runa ichaqa pay kikin.
When everything is great, there is nothing.	Tukuy ima hatun kaptinqa manam imapas kanchu.
Nothing major though.	Mana imapas hatun ichaqa.
He said he knew it was wrong but he continued.	Paymi nirqa mana allin kasqanmanta yachasqanmanta ichaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
I would love to stay a night	Anchatan munani huk tuta qhepakuyta
This is not meant to be.	Kayqa manam chayna kananpaqchu.
I need him to do that again.	Chayta hukmanta ruwananpaqmi necesitasaq.
But they may not know exactly.	Ichaqa manapaschá allintachu yachanku.
But I'm fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kachkani.
Fortunately, like yesterday.	Ancha kusisqa, qayna punchaw hina.
I just never thought about it, you know	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas chaypi yuyaykurqanichu, yachanki
I couldn’t tell who he was	Manam yachayta atirqanichu pi kasqanmanta
I never expected it to be here	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu kaypi kananta
I didn’t want anything	Manam imatapas munarqanichu
I couldn't sleep for three nights	Kimsa tutam mana puñuyta atirqanichu
And a great guy at that.	Hinaspa huk hatun wayna chaypi.
I didn’t really do anything	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas ruwarqanichu
I never realized that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas repararqanichu
He wants to be happy.	Kusisqa kayta munan.
It’s not the first time he’s done this.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kayta ruwasqanqa.
I made the coffee.	Chay kukata ruwarqani.
I’m really, really happy for you.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani qampaq.
It’s more intense.	Aswan sinchi.
I said something today	Kunan punchawmi imatapas nirqani
So, it’s very sad.	Chaymi, ancha llakisqa.
I was never sure what he expected me to do	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani ima ruwanayta suyasqanmanta
He wasn’t going to do it any other way.	Payqa manan huk hinachu ruwanan karqan.
He died a few years later	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan
I feel so much better now.	Kunanqa ancha allinmi sientekuni.
I knew he had done this many times before.	Yacharqanim ñawpaqta achka kutita kayta ruwasqanmanta.
I don’t know what happened here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
It just sort of does it.	Chaylla huk laya ruwan.
Nothing like that was true.	Chay hinaqa manan imapas cheqaqchu karqan.
Until now, I didn't know why	Kunankamaqa manam yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
This was when.	Kayqa karqan hayk’aqmi.
I really need to do something about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa imatapas ruwanay.
I know you know where it is	Yachanim maypi kasqanmanta yachasqaykita
Everyone in the city.	Llaqtapi llapa runakuna.
No, I won’t do it at all	Manam, manam ni imapipas ruwasaqchu
This does a few things.	Kayqa iskay kimsa ruwaykunata ruwan.
I want to tell you something	Imatapas willayta munani
I thought you wanted to know	Yuyarqanim yachayta munasqaykita
Everyone doesn’t even know about this.	Yachan nitaq kaymanta llapa runa.
That may not be true	Chay nisqanqa manapaschá allinchu kanman
This doesn’t make sense yet.	Kayqa manaraqmi imapaqpas valenchu.
It would be nice to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayqa sumaqmi kanman.
He was tired, very tired.	Sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
I don’t see that for anything.	Manam imapaqpas chaynataqa rikunichu.
He must have been in despair.	Payqa yaqapaschá hukmanyasqa kachkarqa.
I immediately saw what he meant	Chayllam rikurqani ima niy munasqanmanta
He says what he wants.	Ima munasqanman hinam nin.
And he’s crazy about you.	Hinaspa payqa qanmanta loco kashan.
I never saw this coming	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kay hamunanta
He couldn’t see it.	Mana rikuyta atirqachu.
He knew exactly who he wanted.	Payqa allintam yacharqa pikuna munasqanmanta.
It’s not that good.	Chayna mana allinchu.
I had to do something faster, something	Imatapas aswan utqayllam ruwanay karqa, imatapas
I cannot tell you how this is	Kay imayna kasqanmantaqa manam willayta atiymanchu
That was a very sad experience.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I thought that was the best way to go	Chayqa aswan allin kananpaqmi piensarqani
I never wanted him to know	Manam haykapipas yachananta munarqanichu
I did everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqani.
Man, it was so great.	Runa, ancha hatunmi karqa.
I don’t think so	Chaynataqa manam piensanichu
And he did, twice.	Hinaspa ruwarqa, iskay kutita.
But he didn’t say anything without a reason.	Ichaqa manan mana imaraykupas imatapas nirqanchu.
I wonder what the problem is.	Tapukuni ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I wonder what’s wrong	Imataq mana allin kasqanmanta tapukuni
But this is really good.	Ichaqa kayqa cheqaqtapunin allin.
I thought about it	Chaypin yuyaykurqani
He never made a big deal out of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa hatun ruwaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I wanted him in jail	Carcelpi kananpaqmi munarqani
I like nice people.	Sumaq runakunam gustan.
He took them off immediately.	Chaykunataqa chaylla hurqurqa.
Maybe it was a school year.	Ichapas yachay wata karqa.
And with him.	Hinaspa paywan kuska.
I didn't know what to say or do	Manañam yacharqanichu ima niyta nitaq ima ruwanayta
It will be a good idea.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kanqa.
I just know it’s good	Chaylla yachani allin kasqanmanta
And, really, what could be better than that?.	Hinaspa, chiqaptapuni, ¿imataq chaymanta aswan allin kanman?.
I don’t really want to be there.	Manam chiqaptachu chaypi kayta munani.
I was very happy	Sinchi kusisqan karqani
I can’t figure out the problem.	Manam chay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
But it was that simple	Ichaqa chay hina facilmi karqan
I never want to leave!	¡Manan hayk’aqpas ripuyta munanichu!
I don’t want to go with you on this.	Manam munanichu kaymantaqa qanwan kuska riyta.
But this has never happened before.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa karqanchu.
I can be someone else	Huk runa kayta atiyman
I still haven't felt that comfortable	Kunankamapas manam chayna allinchu tarikurqani
But that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
I could never find out who he was	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu pi kasqanmantaqa
I thought it probably was	Yuyarqanim yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta
I didn’t think so, but we had to do something	Manam chaynatachu piensarqani, ichaqa imatapas ruwanayku karqa
I did this night after night	Kaytaqa tutamanta tutan ruwarqani
Certainly not this.	Chiqamanta mana kaychu.
I’m not good at it.	Manam allinchu kani chaypiqa.
Nothing, maybe.	Mana imapas, ichapas.
This means that the.	Kayqa niyta munan, chay.
I am now.	Kunanqa kani.
Now that's more like it.	Kunanqa chaymi aswan rikchakun.
That’s never a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu.
But he can’t do it fast enough.	Ichaqa manan atinchu usqhaylla ruwayta.
I do that all the time	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwani
It was sad, like a scared child.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa, mancharisqa wawa hina.
I couldn’t stand that	Chaytaqa manan aguantayta atirqanichu
I was better at this	Kaytaqa aswan allinmi karqani
I can barely hear him.	Yaqapaschá paytaqa uyarini.
I wanted to be in the front.	Ñuqaqa ñawpaqpi kaytam munarqani.
I didn’t think of anything	Manam imatapas piensarqanichu
In most cases, that is good enough.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna allinqa.
I was a bit like you	Ñuqapas qam hinam huk chikan karqani
They are like new.	Musuq hinam kanku.
So he went away.	Chaymi payqa ripurqan.
It wasn't easy but he did it.	Manam facilchu karqa ichaqa paymi chayta ruwarqa.
And he meant it, at the time.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munarqan, chay tiempopi.
If she could have done that, she would have been married before now.	Sichus chayta ruwayta atinman karqan chayqa, kunan ñawpaqtaraqmi casarasqa kanman karqan.
I really wanted to help	Anchatam munarqani yanapayta
You know what you know.	Yachankim yachasqaykita.
They’ve been here before.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqta kaypi karqanku.
I was cold, scared and confused	Chiri, mancharisqa, pantasqa ima karqani
But it was a better time.	Ichaqa aswan allin tiempon karqan.
They are not like that.	Paykunaqa manan chay hinachu kanku.
I’m doing the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwachkani.
I can’t see it, I can’t hear it	Manam rikunichu, mana uyariyta atinichu
I really didn't want to talk about it	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
Yes, he really did say that.	Arí, chiqaptam chaytaqa nirqa.
I can’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
Do what you want, fine.	Munasqaykita ruway, allinmi.
So, it looked like this.	Chaymi, kayna rikchakurqa.
No, he didn’t want to.	Manan, payqa manan munarqanchu.
I can't remember now	Kunanqa manañam yuyariyta atinichu
I would love to go for a ride	Anchatan munani huk carropi riyta
Last night I knew something was wrong.	Qayna tutan yacharqani imapas sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
I couldn't bear to watch it anyway.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu chayta qawayta imayna kaptinpas.
A strange celebrity.	Huk mana riqsisqa riqsisqa runa.
What a beautiful sight!.	¡Ima sumaqmi!.
How do you know if a guy is mad at you.	Imaynatataq yachanki huk wayna qamwan phiñasqa kasqanmanta.
It’s probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanqa.
He wants to act on it, right now.	Payqa chayman hina ruwayta munan, kunanpacha.
I think he was scared	Yuyaykuni mancharisqa kashasqanmanta
Both were true.	Iskayninkum chiqap karqaku.
It doesn’t make any sense to anyone	Manam pimanpas imapaqpas valenchu
I know how badly he wants it	Yachanim imayna millay munasqanmanta
I knew it wasn’t going to happen	Yacharqanim mana chayna kananta
Now he does it all the time.	Kunanqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwan.
You really are something.	Chiqaptam imapas kanki.
Someone needs to do something with him now.	Pipas kunanmi paywan imatapas ruwanan.
I wonder if anyone knows of such a thing.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus pipas yachan chayna kasqanmanta.
It almost never happened.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
I didn’t mean that.	Manam chaynataqa niyta munarqanichu.
I couldn’t hear it at all	Manam imapipas uyariyta atirqanichu
I can’t tell you what they are like	Manam willayta atiymanchu imayna kasqankuta
I was a part of everything.	Tukuy imamanta hukninmi karqani.
He is not here now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kaypichu kashan.
The problem with this ending.	Kay tukukuypi sasachakuy.
I didn't know what, but nothing was right here	Manam yacharqanichu imata, ichaqa kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa
I was sure that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam seguro karqani
I can answer now.	Kunanmi kutichiyta atiyman.
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka kanman.
I am very serious about this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam serio kani.
The big difference.	Hatun chikan kay.
I do it three times a week	Semanapi kimsa kutitam ruwani
I do it differently about half the time	Huk hinam yaqa kuskan kutipi ruwani
And you think about it.	Hinaspa chaypi yuyaykunki.
I want to be yours	Ñoqaqa munani qanpa kayta
Maybe he could have.	Ichapas atinman karqa.
There were people here.	Kaypiqa runakunam karqaku.
Everything is so confusing.	Tukuy imapas chayna pantasqa kachkan.
So I need some help.	Chaymi wakin yanapayta necesitasaq.
Almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchaw.
New less.	Musuq pisi.
If he does as bad as last week, he.	Sichus qayna semana hina mana allinta ruwan chayqa, pay.
I mean that every day	Chayqa sapa punchawmi niyta munani
He’s so there though.	Payqa chayna chaypi kachkan ichaqa.
That’s for you.	Chayqa qampaq.
He couldn’t talk to her.	Payqa manan paywan rimayta atirqanchu.
I can’t, anyway.	Manam atiymanchu, imayna kaptinpas.
I do everything for myself	Tukuy imatam ñuqapaq ruwani
Ultimately it’s up to you.	Qhepamanmi qanmanta kanqa.
I don’t really care about myself	Manam chiqaptachu ñuqamanta llakikuni
I can’t find any solution	Manam ima allichayta tarinichu
But he wants to make sure he does.	Ichaqa chayta ruwananpaqmi seguro kayta munan.
The people were great.	Runakunaqa hatunmi karqaku.
I don’t have time for that	Chaypaqqa manam tiempoy kanchu
He doesn’t like it.	Payqa manan gustanchu.
Therefore, it does not exist.	Chayraykum mana kanchu.
Maybe he’s happy here.	Ichapas kaypi kusisqa kachkan.
Yes, three weeks.	Arí, kimsa semana.
I thought you were safe	Ñuqaqa seguro kasqaykita piensarqani
I know they have him in jail	Yachanim payta carcelpi kasqankuta
So, however, this was not always the case.	Chaymi ichaqa mana sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I want to get home first	Ñawpaqtaqa wasinman chayayta munani
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t	Manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu
I know you want me to be happy	Yachanim kusisqa kanaypaq munasqaykita
I have no idea about this	Kaymantaqa manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani
The thing is as bad as it can be.	Chay imapas mana allinqa atisqanman hinam.
What a day it is.	Ima punchawmi.
I can't stop watching him	Manam payta qawayta saqiyta atiymanchu
I couldn’t see the road	Manam ñanta rikuyta atirqanichu
Please tell me what you can.	Ama hina kaspa, imatachus atisqaykita willaway.
It’s best to do the hard part first	Aswan allinmi kanman sasa kaqta ñawpaqta ruway
There’s something after that.	Chay qhepamanmi imapas kan.
I want to know more here	Kaypi astawan yachayta munani
I have not seen this before	Kaytaqa manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
I still can't figure out what happened though	Kunankamapas manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imakuna pasasqanmanta ichaqa
I mean that in a positive way.	Chaytaqa allin kaqta hinam niyta munani.
I have to be like everyone else.	Ñoqapas llapa runakuna hinan kanay.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chaynatachu ruwayta munani.
I didn’t really think about it at all	Manam chiqaptaqa chaypiqa piensarqanichu ni imapipas
Please, don’t be this.	Ama hina kaspa, ama kaychu.
I didn't want to believe them	Chaykunataqa manam creeyta munarqanichu
It really wasn't difficult.	Chiqaptaqa manam sasachu karqa.
I've done that before	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam ruwarqani
You don’t have to rush it.	Manan usqhayllachu ruwanayki.
He went quickly.	Payqa utqayllam rirqa.
But it’s another morning.	Ichaqa huk paqarinmi.
You have a chance.	Qamqa kanmi chansa.
I haven’t done that in a long time	Unayñan mana chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
Maybe, maybe, maybe .	Ichapas, ichapas, ichapas .
Then, do it again.	Chaymanta, yapamanta ruway.
I can't stand to hear it anymore	Manañam aguantayta atinichu uyariyta
I know a way we can do that	Yachanim huk ñanta chayta ruwanaykupaq
I'm sorry, I don't.	Pampachaykuway, manam, nispa.
But what was his he could not say.	Ichaqa imataq paypaq karqan mana niyta atirqanchu.
I was immediately struck by the size of everything	Chayllam admirakurqani tukuy ima hatun kasqanmanta
So very, very wrong.	Chaymi ancha, ancha pantasqa.
This is the hard part.	Kaymi sinchi kaq.
I know why he has to go	Yachanim imanasqa rinan kasqanmanta
I'll do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruwasaq.
He is the only one.	Payqa chayllam.
Now it was a real beauty.	Kunanqa chiqap sumaq kaymi karqa.
I think it’s up to you	Yuyaykuni qanmanta kanqa
He was the best player there.	Payqa chaypi kaq aswan allin pukllaqmi karqan.
One of them said.	Hukninmi nirqa.
Yes it is very good.	Arí ancha allin.
And he did this.	Hinaspa kayta ruwarqa.
But it looks really good.	Ichaqa cheqaq allinmi rikch’akun.
I’m the only one there.	Ñuqallam kani chaypiqa.
I can’t tell you about it	Manam chaymantaqa willayta atiymanchu
I never made that about my personality	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu imayna runa kasqaymanta
This was a seriously great moment.	Kayqa karqan sinchi hatun pacha.
What a terrible thing.	Ima manchay imapas.
He couldn't say that.	Payqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.
Then I made a game of it	Chaymantam huk pukllayta ruwarqani
I know this won't be a problem.	Yachanim kayqa mana sasachakuy kananta.
Probably too many.	Yaqapaschá ancha achka.
I can’t do that	Manan chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
This is neither here nor there.	Kayqa manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
I know this would be wrong	Yachanim kayqa mana allinchu kanman
It’s like there’s something.	Imapas kanman hina.
I heard this a few years ago	Kaytaqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi uyarirqani
Seriously would love to hear from you	Serio anchata munani uyariyta qanmanta
However, doing things will not work.	Ichaqa, imakunatapas ruwayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
I never realized that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa repararqanichu.
I have to be the one.	Ñuqaqa kanay tiyan.
That’s pretty interesting, actually.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
I hope you’re hungry	Suyachkani yarqasqa kasqaykita
I worry, every day for you	Llakikuni, sapa punchaw qampaq
He's doing that a lot tonight.	Chaytaqa kunan tutam anchata ruwachkan.
In fact, if you do, you may not be able to.	Aswanpas chayta ruwanki chayqa, yaqapaschá manaña atiwaqchu.
This has been going on for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina ruwayqa kashan.
I wonder when it will be.	Tapukuni haykapi kanqa nispa.
I think you could have done better	Yuyaykuni aswan allinta ruwawaq karqan
The first is set in the present.	Ñawpaq kaqmi kunan tiempopi churasqa kashan.
I wanted to be happy with him	Paywan kusisqa kaytam munarqani
That’s how it should be.	Chayna kanan.
The process is remarkable.	Chay ruwayqa admirakuypaqmi.
I was lucky enough to be a part of it	Suerteyoqmi karqani chaymanta huknin kanaypaq
I really want to win	Anchatan munani atipayta
I hear it all day, every day	Tukuy punchawmi, sapa punchawmi uyarini
I really can't remember anything	Chiqaptaqa manam imatapas yuyariyta atinichu
And they’re great.	Hinaspa hatun kanku.
These are regular people.	Kaykunaqa sapa kuti runakunam.
I really wanted a good time together tonight	Anchatam munarqani kunan tuta kuska allin tiempota
I don’t understand it	Manam entiendenichu
Maybe something happened.	Ichapas imapas pasarqa.
He'll never do that.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
But they are much larger.	Ichaqa aswan hatunmi kanku.
You’re really not like him.	Chiqaptaqa manam pay hinachu kanki.
He was proud of me.	Payqa orgulloso karqan ñoqamanta.
I wanted to be him	Pay kaytam munarqani
And, it would be pretty good.	Hinaspa, allin allinmi kanman.
It was a cold morning.	Chiri paqarinmi karqa.
They were human beings.	Paykunaqa runakunam karqaku.
Very well, perhaps.	Ancha allinmi, ichapas.
That is, in the past.	Chayqa, ñawpaqpi.
I wasn’t sure what would happen next	Manam segurochu karqani chaymanta imakuna pasananta
He couldn’t do anything else.	Payqa manan huk ruwayta atirqanchu.
I didn’t want to see anything	Manam imatapas qawayta munarqanichu
But it was the right thing to do.	Ichaqa allin ruwaymi karqan.
Follow the steps outlined above.	Chay hawapi nisqanman hina ruway.
Great, he said.	Hatun, nispa.
That’s what I finally figured out	Chaytan qhepaman yuyaykurqani
Otherwise, whatever.	Mana chayqa, imapas.
I couldn't deal with that	Chaywanqa manam atipayta atirqanichu
I was everybody else	Ñuqaqa tukuy runam karqani
But nobody knew much.	Ichaqa manan pipas anchatachu yacharqan.
He didn’t want that.	Chaytaqa manan munarqanchu.
I thought maybe he did it on purpose	Yuyarqanim yaqapaschá chaytaqa munasqanman hina ruwasqanmanta
But then why should he do that.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, ¿imaraykutaq chayta ruwanan tiyan.
Nothing really unique.	Mana imapas chiqap sapallanchu.
Find out who they are today.	Kunan tiempopi pikuna kasqankuta yachay.
Yes that’s a good thing.	Arí chayqa allinmi.
I want to, but it’s not here	Munani, ichaqa manan kaypichu
The people are good.	Runakunaqa allin kanku.
I love it there	Chaypiqa anchatam munani
I can't stand it now	Kunanqa manam aguantayta atinichu
I mean that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim niyta munani.
You know something.	Imatapas yachanki.

The result is immediate.	Chay ruwasqanqa chayllam.
I was set up to fail	Mana allinta ruwanaypaqmi churasqa karqani
I will never be able to stand it	Manam haykapipas aguantayta atisaqchu
But I’m not quite sure how to do that.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatachus chayta ruwanaypaq.
I wanted to eat alone today	Kunan punchawmi sapallay mikuyta munarqani
But I never see him	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa rikunichu
I think this is it for me	Kaymi ñuqapaq kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
He knows about me.	Payqa yachanmi ñoqamanta.
I thought that was great	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani
I can't remember when it was posted.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu haykapi churasqa kasqanmanta.
I didn’t see a way out of it	Manam rikurqanichu chaymanta lluqsiyta
I want to make sure that nothing like that happens here.	Kaypiqa mana imapas chayna kananpaqmi seguro kayta munani.
He said he didn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu nispan nisqa.
You are the only one.	Qamqa chayllam kanki.
I really wanted it to fail	Anchatan munarqani mana allintachu ruwananta
This was the hidden secret.	Kaymi pakasqa pakasqa kasqa.
I am an everyday person	Sapa punchaw runam kani
I think you’re crazy.	Yuyaykuni loco kasqaykita.
I mean, this all seems so simple	Niyta munani, kayqa tukuy imapas ancha facilmi rikchakun
What does he know.	Imatataq yachan.
He said that over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim nirqa.
But there was something there.	Ichaqa chaypim imapas karqa.
I certainly never will	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwasaqchu
So it was the best way to make it work.	Chaymi aswan allinqa karqan chay allin kananpaq.
I know you are one of them.	Yachanim huknin kasqaykita.
The truth is, no one knows.	Cheqaq kaqmi, manan pipas yachanchu.
I haven’t done enough yet	Manaraqmi allintachu ruwarqani
I never want to be alone	Manam haykapipas sapallay kayta munanichu
I still think he is older he says	Hinallam piensani kuraq kasqanmanta chaytam nin
They have such a mindset.	Paykunaqa chayna yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I knew he never would.	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas ruwananta.
But now, there’s nothing there.	Ichaqa kunanqa, manan imapas chaypiqa kanchu.
And that’s why this is so important.	Hinaspa chaymi kayqa ancha importante.
More than half an hour ago, in fact.	Aswan kuskan hora ñawpaqta, chiqaptaqa.
Now tell me the truth.	Kunanqa cheqaq kaqta willaway.
Maybe I’ll agree with you	Ichapas qanwan acuerdopi kasaq
But if you can’t do that here, then.	Ichaqa sichus mana chayta ruwayta atiwaqchu kaypi, hinaqa.
I don’t want it anymore	Manañam munanichu
At this point I was quickly tired.	Kaypiqa usqhayllan sayk’usqa karqani.
I don’t know what happened before.	Manam yachanichu ñawpaqta imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I thought maybe you could have.	Yuyarqanim ichapas chayta ruwawaq karqa.
I had an idea where it might be.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi karqani maypi kanman chayta.
Learn to swim.	Nadayta yachay.
I was sure it was	Seguro karqani chayna kasqanmanta
And where was he now.	Hinaspa maypitaq kunan kasqa.
I wish he wouldn’t do that.	Chayta mana ruwananta munani.
He doesn’t care, though.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, ichaqa.
Here is how it went.	Kaypim imayna rirqa.
He did this many times.	Achka kutitam chaytaqa ruwarqa.
I would like to talk	Munaymanmi rimayta
Now I am sorry now	Kunanqa kunanmi llakikuni
I didn't feel well that day	Chay punchawqa manam allinchu tarikurqani
I really want to be like that	Chayna kaytam anchata munani
This was now.	Kayqa kunanmi karqa.
I wanted to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munarqani.
He is alone	Payqa sapallanmi
Everything is fine, thank you.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, gracias.
That should certainly be the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kanan.
So tell me what happened.	Chaymi willaway imataq pasasqanmanta.
I couldn’t let him win	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu atipananta
I'll do that right away.	Chaytaqa chayllam ruwasaq.
He was ambivalent.	Payqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
You don't want to here.	Kaypiqa manam munankichu.
I thought we should take a walk or something.	Yuyarqanim huk puriyta utaq imatapas ruwanaykupaq.
People were terrified.	Runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
Maybe people were scared.	Ichapas runakunaqa mancharisqa karqaku.
I wish he wasn't there	Munaymanmi mana chaypi kaptinqa
It was really cold.	Chiqamanta chiri karqa.
I worry about everything	Tukuy imamanta llakikuni
I can't stop anything	Manan imatapas hark'ayta atiymanchu
I can’t say that’s the case this time.	Mana niyta atiymanchu kay kutipi chayna kasqanmanta.
Or he lives here.	Utaq kaypi tiyan.
It’s not like it’s coming.	Mana hamuq hinachu.
Tell me something.	Imatapas willaway.
He is not here now.	Kunanqa manañam kaypichu kachkan.
I know you can help him.	Yachanim payta yanapayta atisqaykita.
They are not here.	Paykunaqa manan kaypichu kashanku.
I knew he wanted out	Yacharqanim lluqsiyta munasqanmanta
I couldn't tell if he was nervous, nervous or excited	Manam yachayta atirqanichu mancharisqa, mancharisqa utaq kusisqa kasqanmanta
I want to get out faster.	Aswan utqaylla lluqsiyta munani.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kashan.
I want to know everything too	Ñoqapas tukuy imatapas yachayta munani
Every last one is great.	Sapa qhipa kaq hatunmi.
I wish I knew what it was like	Munaymanmi imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
I didn't think it was very good	Manam ancha allin kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
I didn’t do anything either	Ñoqapas manan imatapas ruwarqanichu
I never agreed with that	Manam haykapipas chaywanqa acuerdopichu karqani
I wish it was that easy	Munaymanmi chayna facil kananpaq
But I could never get over it	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas atipayta atirqanichu
Repeat ten times.	Chunka kutita yapamanta ruway.
I think he didn’t want to go	Yuyaykuni mana riyta munasqanmanta
I didn’t want to not tell you	Manam mana willayta munarqanichu
I knew you would do it again	Yacharqanim hukmanta ruwanaykita
Can't say more.	Mana astawan niyta atinchu.
Maybe he knows something.	Ichapas payqa imatapas yachan.
I mean, he wanted to know why	Niyta munani, payqa yachayta munarqan imarayku chayta
I don't remember anything being said	Manam yuyarinichu imapas nisqa kasqanmantaqa
I couldn't bear to watch	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu qawayta
This is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa.
I was excited and nervous	Kusisqa, mancharisqa ima karqani
I won’t be able to see anything	Manam imatapas rikuyta atisaqchu
I was sure of that now.	Chaymantaqa kunanqa segurom karqani.
We played together.	Kuska pukllaq kayku.
I know how to find it	Yachanim imayna tariyta
But I couldn’t do it yet	Ichaqa manaraqmi ruwayta atirqanichu
The way he did it was amazing	Imayna ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi karqa
It was a tragic experience	Llakikuypaqmi karqa
I don’t know how to say it.	Manam yachanichu imayna niyta.
But that’s what he meant.	Ichaqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
I know you want to talk	Yachanim rimayta munasqaykita
Like sick people.	Unqusqa runakuna hina.
I want to know things	Imakunatapas yachayta munani
It was a great night.	Chay tutaqa ancha allinmi karqa.

Man, they’re beautiful.	Runa, sumaqmi kanku.
One of them is ugly.	Hukninmi millay.
One of them was thirty.	Hukninmi karqa kimsa chunka.
It was better for a while after that.	Chay qhepamanmi huk tiempo aswan allin karqan.
I’m sick of being here.	Kaypi kasqaymanta unqusqa kachkani.
I just did it right away	Chayllam chaytaqa ruwarqani
I’m not quite sure why this would be.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqataq kayna kanman.
I felt as happy as a child	Wawa hinam kusisqa tarikurqani
I hope it goes well for you.	Suyachkani allinta qampaq rinanpaq.
He’s a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq runam.
You said that’s what you said.	Chaytaqa nirqanki.
But I’ve never seen that before.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
Being great at something else.	Huk ruwaypi hatun kay.
I didn’t know it would be like this	Manam yacharqanichu kayna kananta
I can’t stand it either	Ñuqapas manam aguantayta atinichu
That’s the great thing about me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta hatun kaqmi.
I thought of the story.	Chay willayta yuyaykurqani.
I wonder how he does that	Imaynatataq chayta ruwan nispa tapukuni
I know how to play this game.	Kay pukllayta pukllayta yachani.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa manachá allinchu.
I wonder where he lives	Maypi tiyasqanmanta tapukuni
They seem to be very familiar.	Paykunaqa ancha riqsisqa hinam kanku.
It just looks like he has to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan hinallam rikchakun.
I don’t feel very well.	Manam ancha allintachu sientekuni.
I wanted all the money	Llapa qolqetan munarqani
I know that is not the case now	Yachanim kunanqa mana chayna kasqanmanta
I look forward to finding out how it is	Suyachkani imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
I saw him, that last night	Payta rikurqani, chay qayna tuta
He shouldn't be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan.
He didn’t really want to.	Payqa manan anchatachu munarqan.
He was a real person.	Payqa chiqap runam karqa.
Those two things for sure.	Chay iskay imakuna seguro kasqanmanta.
I thought you could take a look at him.	Yuyarqanim payta huk qawayta atisqaykita.
I can’t wait to hear it	Manam suyayta atiymanchu uyariyta
And so true.	Hinaspa chayna chiqap.
I mean, he probably doesn’t	Niyta munani, payqa manachá chayta ruwanchu
But it looked nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
As in the past.	Ñawpaq tiempopi hina.
In fact, he didn’t.	Aswanpas manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I have an idea here	Kaypiqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani
A teacher was there	Huk yachachiqmi chaypi kasqa
I'm not very good anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam ancha allinchu kani.
I thought I’d tell you later	Qhepamanmi willanaypaq yuyaykurqani
The man is going.	Chay runaqa rin.
One of these is the.	Hukninmi chay.
But he didn't want to hear anything about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa uyariyta munarqanchu.
Maybe I will too.	Ichapas ñuqapas chayta ruwasaq.
I knew you could make it	Yacharqanim chayayta atisqaykita
I don’t care what happens to you anymore	Manañan imananpaschu imachus qanwan pasananta
It’s actually rather interesting.	Chiqaptaqa aswan sumaqmi.
I almost couldn’t believe it	Yaqapaschá mana creeyta atirqanichu
He doesn’t want to hear it.	Manam uyariyta munanchu.
She’s probably tired of him.	Payqa yaqapaschá paymanta sayk’usqa kashan.
Today is not a good day.	Kunan punchaw mana allinchu.
I didn't think it would ever be this bad	Manam piensarqanichu haykapipas kayna millay kananta
It says what it is.	Ima kasqanmantam nin.
But I really don’t understand how to do it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana entiendenichu imayna ruwanayta.
I knew he wasn't crazy	Yacharqanim mana loco kasqanmanta
He never thought he would actually do it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu cheqaqtapuni chayta ruwananta.
That would mean a whole new world.	Chayqa huk musuq pacha niyta munanman.
I can’t do anything else	Manañam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
If you wanted to, you probably couldn’t, anyway.	Munaspaqa manachá atiwaqchu, imayna kaptinpas.
That’s all, really.	Chaylla, chiqap.
It means well to you, very well, that kind of thing.	Allintam niyta munan qampaq, ancha allinmi, chayna kaq.
I couldn’t figure him out	Manam paytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu
Caught.	Hap'isqa.
Everything had to be great.	Tukuy imapas hatunmi kanan karqa.
It should be done immediately.	Chaylla ruwana.
I thought it was bad	Mana allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I never knew it would happen this fast	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kay utqaylla pasananta
I have felt that way many times	Achka kutitam chaynata hina tarikurqani
It seemed like no one else did.	Mana pipas chayta ruwaq hinam karqa.
That’s why I did it.	Chayraykum chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I do that pretty much all the time.	Chaytaqa yaqa sapa kutim ruwani.
That’s why I’m happy.	Chayraykum kusisqa kachkani.
I never wanted to be like that	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu
He was scared, this.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa, kayqa.
But in a better way.	Ichaqa aswan allin ruwaypi.
I really can't sleep with you tonight	Chiqaptaqa manam kunan tutaqa qamwan puñuyta atiymanchu
They were expelled	Paykunaqa qarqosqa karqanku
I know you want to too	Yachanim qampas munasqaykita
It’s not like that.	Mana hinachu.
I suspect he wants to be arrested	Sospechani hapisqa kayta munasqanmanta
He barely makes it.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana chayayta atinchu.
No, not everyone does.	Manan, llapa runan mana.
But it doesn't matter now.	Ama kunanqa imananpaschu.
I was good at tennis	Ñuqaqa tenispi allintam karqani
I'm sure he didn't go there	Seguro kani chayman mana risqanmanta
I haven’t seen this before.	Manaraq kayta rikurqanichu.
Boy, and he got it.	Wayna, hinaspa chayta hap’irqan.
That’s all, please.	Chaylla, ama hina kaspa.
He could be here now.	Payqa kunan kaypi kanman.
I don’t want to do that again	Manam hukmanta chayta ruwayta munanichu
He doesn’t want to fix them.	Manam chaykunataqa allichayta munanchu.
I want to believe that.	Chaytaqa creeyta munani.
But unfortunately, it's not that simple.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi, manam chayna facilchu.
Do something, if you have to.	Imatapas ruway, ruwanayki kaptinqa.
I didn’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu.
That’s what makes him so unique.	Chayqa chaymi mana pay hinachu.
I want to talk to him after that	Chay qhepamanmi paywan rimayta munani
Join us right now!.	¡Kunanpacha ñuqaykuwan kuska!.
Anyone can have a bad attitude.	Pipas mana allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
The first was the weather.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan pacha.
You will be very happy and disappointed.	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa kanki.
They know everything.	Paykunaqa tukuy imatam yachanku.
The truth is, he will never be happy.	Cheqaq kaqmi, payqa manan hayk’aqpas kusisqachu kanqa.
I can't work on it now.	Kunanqa manañam chaypi llamk'ayta atiymanchu.
I never thought about it, really	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu, chiqaptaqa
Maybe you are, maybe you’re not.	Ichapas kanki, ichapas mana.
It just can’t do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atinchu.
He knows how to play.	Payqa pukllayta yachan.
I will always do it.	Sapa kutim ruwasaq.
As always, I want to be better.	Sapa kuti hinam aswan allin kayta munani.
I know you can do the same	Yachanim qampas chaynata ruwayta atisqaykita
I can’t stop talking	Manam rimayta saqiyta atiymanchu
I couldn’t let anything happen to him	Manam atirqanichu imapas paywan pasananta
He probably wasn’t here.	Manapaschá kaypichu karqan.
Or next year.	Utaq hamuq wata.
A man who is out of place	Mana maypi kasqanpi kaq runa
And, it just happened.	Hinaspa, chaylla pasarqa.
I just couldn’t see anything	Chaylla mana imatapas rikuyta atirqanichu
He was worried the kid was here.	Payqa llakisqa kasqa chay wawa kaypi kasqanmanta.
That was about a week and a half ago.	Chayqa karqan yaqa huk semana kuskan ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I thought he was gone	Manaña kasqanmantam piensarqani
I knew it was mine.	Yacharqanim ñuqapa kasqanmanta.
I don’t know that for sure at all	Chaytaqa manan imapipas allintachu yachani
Please tell me how to do it, if you know.	Ama hina kaspa, imayna ruwanayta willaway, yachanki chayqa.
I doubt this is true.	Iskayrayani kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
Again, we are human.	Yapamanta, runa kanchik.
I was surprised by the results	Chayna kasqanmantam admirakurqani
I had a party that night	Chay tutan huk fiestata ruwarqani
I did something quickly	Imatapas usqhayllan ruwarqani
That’s why coffee.	Chayraykum kukata.
That would be a good thing	Chaywanqa allinmi kanman
I feel so happy and great	Sinchi kusisqa hinaspa hatunmi sientekuni
It wasn't that hard to do.	Manam chayna sasachu karqa ruwayqa.
They want to get with me.	Paykunaqa ñuqawan chayayta munanku.
He can go as he pleases.	Munasqanman hinam riyta atin.
I've seen it that way before	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam rikurqani
That’s longer.	Chayqa aswan unayta.
Really dark stuff there.	Chiqamanta yana imakuna chaypi.
I think he’s planning to talk to you	Yuyaykuni qanwan rimayta yuyaykushan
But the truth did.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi chayta ruwarqan.
I just can’t stand what happened to her	Chaylla mana aguantayta atinichu imachus paywan pasasqanmanta
I think that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispam piensani.
I just didn’t know what to do about it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanayta
It was the perfect set up.	Chayqa karqan allin churasqa churasqa.
I’m hurt and frustrated	K’irisqa, hukmanyasqa ima tarikuni
He certainly could.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa atinman karqan.
In most cases, this is not a good thing.	Yaqa llapanpim chayqa mana allinchu.
I wonder who it might be	Pitaq kanman chayta tapukuni
A man like him.	Pay hina runa.
He realized they weren’t right.	Payqa repararqanmi mana allinchu kasqankuta.
I can't tell you now	Kunanqa manam willayta atiymanchu
He never, ever, ever did .	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu .
I wasn't sure how that happened	Manam segurochu karqani imaynatam chayna kasqanmantaqa
Know everything about it.	Tukuy imata yachay.
I would have to do it	Ñuqaqa ruwanay kanman karqan
I just didn’t expect to find anyone here.	Chaylla mana suyarqanichu kaypi pitapas tariyta.
Being the best you can be.	Aswan allin kaq kay.
I probably don’t like it.	Manapaschá gustawanchu.
I very nearly didn’t.	Ancha yaqa mana ruwarqanichu.
I don't know how to handle it.	Manam yachanichu imayna hapiyta.
I’m a very nice guy.	Ancha sumaqmi kani.
That will never happen.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
I hope to fix it soon	Suyachkani chaylla allichayta
That would seem to do it.	Chayqa ruwanman hinam kanman.
I still can't believe it, really.	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu, chiqaptapuni.
We have to do something.	Imapas ruwananchik.
I’m not sure he knows	Manam segurochu kani yachasqanmanta
So that’s the first big thing.	Chaymi chaymi ñawpaq hatun kaq.
Ready, set, go!.	¡Listo, churasqa, riy!.
This would make the process much easier.	Chaywanqa chay ruwayqa aswan facilmi kanman.
But he finds himself alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi tarikun.
Be a good person, of course.	Allin runa kay, chiqamanta.
Tell me what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta willaway.
I didn’t really know what was going on	Manam allintachu yacharqani imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
He knows what is right and what is wrong.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna allin kasqanmanta, imakuna mana allin kasqanmanta.
I really want to know	Chiqamanta yachayta munani
I have no idea why or how or anything.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku nitaq imayna nitaq imamantapas.
I heard just about everything	Yaqa tukuy imatam uyarirqani
I continued to be surprised	Hinallam admirakurqani
More on this here.	Astawan kaymanta kaypi.
Go for it to be difficult.	Sasa kananpaq riy.
I was really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani.
Twenty times not.	Iskay chunka kuti mana.
But a letter would have been nice	Ichaqa huk cartata sumaqmi kanman karqan
That’s the only one.	Chay sapallan.
I know all about it	Tukuy chaymanta yachani
I look forward to this process.	Kay ruwayta suyachkani.
In the last month.	Qhipa killapi.
I know who you are.	Yachanim pi kasqaykita.
That was about three hours ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi.
I’m going to have to be serious	Ñuqaqa serio kanay kanqa
I wasn’t quite sure why	Manam allintachu yacharqani imanasqa kasqanmanta
Yes, this is a good thing.	Arí, kayqa allinmi.
It no longer felt cold.	Manañam chiri hinachu tarikurqa.
He was now fired.	Paymi kunan qarqosqa karqan.
Being unconscious.	Mana yuyayniyuq kay.
I question everything	Tukuy imatam tapukuni
I want to get right there	Chaymanqa allintam chayayta munani
If it is otherwise.	Huk hina kaptinqa.
Eventually it was too much for him to see.	Qhepamanmi nishuta karqan, manan rikuyta atirqanchu.
It has to be the first one.	Ñawpaq kaqmi kanan.
Tomorrow will be better.	Paqarinmi aswan allin kanqa.
So there’s a lot to do.	Chaymi achka ruwana.
If he doesn’t do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwaptinqa.
There is a lot of disagreement.	Achka mana acuerdopichu kachkan.
It’s very, very difficult.	Ancha ancha sasam.
I think that would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
But it should be easy.	Ichaqa facilmi kanan.
I don’t want to hear it again.	Manam hukmanta uyariyta munanichu.
It still exists today	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkan
There was so much going on	Chaypiqa ancha achka ruwaymi karqa
It’s easier but not.	Aswan facilmi ichaqa mana.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Ichapas paqarin tuta.
One of them had to do something.	Hukninmi imatapas ruwanan karqa.
I didn’t quite know what to say	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima niyta
I couldn’t keep up with it	Manam chayman hina ruwayta atiymanchu karqa
I just can't find a job	Chaylla mana llamkayta tarinichu
I think they’re happy	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kasqankuta
I was the youngest	Sullk'a kaqmi karqani
Three for sure.	Kimsa seguro.
I’ve seen myself do this a lot	Kayta anchata ruwasqayta rikurqani
He wanted to know about her.	Payqa paymanta yachayta munarqan.
This will create a window.	Kayqa huk ventanata ruwanqa.
There and there.	Chaypi chaypi.
All right, great.	Allinmi, hatun.
And there was nothing good about it.	Hinaspa chaypiqa mana allinchu karqa.
This is nowhere near a bad thing.	Kayqa manam maypipas mana allinchu.
But then, he never could.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, manan hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
I don’t understand him	Manam paytaqa entiendenichu
I thought this would be good	Kay allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
Now to make the food.	Kunanqa mikhunata ruwanapaq.
He can't remember why he didn't say anything at the time.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atinchu imaraykun chay tiempopi mana imatapas nirqanchu.
If you want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munaspaqa.
I didn’t mean you didn’t	Manam niyta munarqanichu mana chaynata ruwasqaykita
You can’t do that.	Manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I can't do that here	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwaymanchu
I can’t talk to him yet.	Manaraqmi paywan rimayta atinichu.
So you’re not doing it right.	Chaymi mana allintachu ruwanki.
This doesn’t sound right.	Kayqa mana allintachu uyarikun.
So, if that’s the case.	Chaymi, chayna kaptinqa.
I couldn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikuyta atirqanichu.
This would be a good thing if it was right.	Kayqa allinmi kanman allin kaptinqa.
I am doing a lot now	Kunanqa achkatam ruwachkani
He says he’ll be fine, but he knows.	Allinmi kanqa nispas nin, ichaqa yachanmi.
It was supposed to be a good day.	Allin punchawmi kanan karqa.
I know exactly how that feels	Chayqa allintam yachani imayna sientekusqanmanta
They're tired of it.	Paykunaqa sayk'usqañan kashanku.
Man, that sounds good.	Runa, chayqa allinmi uyarikun.
Please let me know what you think.	Ama hina kaspa ima yuyaykusqaykita willaway.
Sounds like him.	Pay hinam uyarikun.
I can't really comment on that	Chaymantaqa manam chiqaptachu rimayta atiyman
It makes no sense at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He's got it right.	Payqa chayta allinta hap'isqa.
I fear that happens many times.	Manchakuni achka kutipi chay pasananta.
And that’s a very good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha allinmi.
Maybe both are true	Ichapas iskayninku chiqap kasqankuta
It was a good thing to do.	Allin ruwaymi karqa.
I, I’m alone.	Ñuqa, ñuqa sapallay.
I just found out what happened	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani imakuna pasasqanmanta
It doesn’t exist in time.	Manan tiempopiqa kanchu.
But I knew it would happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kananta.
Accordingly, he was appointed.	Chayman hinam payqa churasqa karqa.
I never realized what a good person you were	Manam haykapipas repararqanichu ima allin runa kasqaykita
I am so glad that it did	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqanmanta
The process was huge.	Chay ruwayqa hatunmi karqa.
I really mean it this time.	Chiqamanta kay kutipi chayta niyta munani.
Perhaps but that is not an important feature.	Ichapas ichaqa chayqa manam huk importante ruwaychu.
I mean, please.	Niyta munani, ama hina kaspa.
He wants to be where the real action is.	Payqa maypichus chiqap ruway kachkan chaypi kaytam munan.
So, we have to do it.	Chaymi, ruwananchik.
I have no idea how that happened.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
This can be a very difficult task.	Kayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi kanman.
But make him proud.	Ichaqa orgulloso kananpaq ruway.
I was really alone	Chiqaptam sapallay karqani
I didn't think he would come here right away	Manam chayllachu piensarqani kayman hamunanta
And they know that.	Hinaspa chayta yachanku.
I want to know what happened here	Kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munani
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Payqa manan imatapas paywan ruwayta munarqanchu.
I might too, one day	Ñuqapas ichapas, huk punchaw
Maybe you were a lot like me.	Ichapas qampas anchata ñuqa hina karqanki.
I can't wait to be with her	Manam suyayta atinichu paywan kuska kayta
Someone looked out.	Pipas hawaman qhawarisqa.
But now it looks very bad.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
He was a great man, a great man.	Payqa hatun runam karqa, hatun runam karqa.
Where it went wrong.	Maypichus mana allintachu rirqa.
They are bad people.	Mana allin runakunam kanku.
Now I know what you mean	Kunanqa yachanin ima niyta munasqaykita
I was sure it would be good	Seguro karqani allin kananmanta
I’m really going to go	Chiqaptam risaq
I can tell you more tomorrow	Paqarinmi astawan willayta atiyman
I have three people with me	Kimsa runam ñuqawan kachkan
Other than that, he was fine.	Mana chaymantaqa, payqa allinmi karqa.
A seriously injured man.	Sinchi k’irisqa runa.
I know this is not always the case	Yachanim kayqa manam sapa kutichu chayna kasqanmanta
I do better without it	Mana chaywanqa aswan allintam ruwani
I hear it all the time	Sapa kutim uyarini
Present or future tense.	Kunan pacha utaq hamuq pacha.
Like he never wanted to.	Mana hayk’aqpas munasqanman hina.
This is probably the easy one.	Kayqa yaqapaschá facil kaq.
I don't need that now	Chaypaqqa manam kunanqa necesitasaqchu
I couldn’t stay with him anymore	Manañan paywan qhepakuyta atirqanichu
I think about that a lot.	Chaymantaqa anchatam piensani.
But it was very sad.	Ichaqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I can’t watch it anymore.	Manañam qawayta atinichu.
I just found out he was injured	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani k’irisqa kashasqanmanta
I didn't know how many people there were.	Manam yacharqanichu hayka runakuna kasqanmantaqa.
It is wrong to do otherwise.	Mana allinchu huk hinata ruway.
And that would be great.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Maybe he wants to see it, maybe he doesn't.	Ichapas qawayta munanman, manapaschá.
I wanted to know if that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam yachayta munarqani
He’s, he’s.	Payqa, payqa.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
Do this, do that.	Kayta ruway, chayta ruway.
The morning is very cold.	Paqarin ancha chiri.
At any given time.	Mayqin pachapi.
He is not alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kachkan.
I hadn’t seen him there before.	Chaypiqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
Of course.	Riki.
I can’t find it	Manam tariyta atiymanchu
I can't stand to see you like this anymore	Manañam aguantayta atinichu kayna qawayta
I doubt that’s all	Iskayrayani chaylla kasqanmanta
That's the only time I'm really disappointed	Chayllam chiqaptapuni hukmanyasqa tarikuni
He wasn’t sure he would do anything happy, ever.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan kusisqa imatapas ruwananmanta, hayk’aqpas.
So, that’s it.	Chaymi, chayna.
I’ve always been here.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi kaypi karqani.
Not sure if this is correct.	Mana segurochu kayqa allinchu icha manachu.
You think it’s real.	Chiqap kananpaqmi yuyanki.
I just thought of something.	Chayraqmi imapipas yuyaykurqani.
He can't do it.	Payqa manam ruwayta atinmanchu.
You want to do something.	Imatapas ruwayta munanki.
But that’s good for him.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi paypaq.
I didn’t realize how many people were like that	Manam repararqanichu hayka runakuna chayna kasqanmantaqa
Really know this.	Chiqamanta kayta yachay.
He's doing really well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta ruwachkan.
If not larger.	Mana aswan hatun kaptinqa.
But say what.	Ichaqa niy imata.
I wish it were the case.	Munayman chayna kananpaq.
But, and a big but, it will be.	Ichaqa, hinaspa hatun ichaqa, kanqa.
He doesn’t do that anymore.	Payqa manañan chayta ruwanchu.
I didn’t think about it.	Chaypiqa manam piensarqanichu.
I didn't think it would be that hard really	Manam piensarqanichu chayna sasa kananta chiqaptapuni
Me too, he says.	Ñuqapas, nispas nin.
It shouldn’t be there.	Mana chaypichu kanan.
This was a novelty	Kayqa huk musuq kaqmi karqa
I can't remember when that was	Manam yuyariyta atinichu haykapi chay kasqanmantaqa
You can’t tell.	Manam willayta atiwaqchu.
There is someone.	Pipas kanmi.
I just knew he would	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani chayta ruwananta
And really black.	Hinaspa chiqap yana.
This guy is going to be a great guy.	Kay runaqa hatun runam kanqa.
Any year, or ten years.	Mayqin wata, icha chunka wata.
In fact, one day he will.	Aswanpas, huk punchawmi chayta ruwanqa.
I think he liked it a lot	Yuyaykuni anchata gustasqanmanta
He has to be there.	Payqa chaypim kanan.
Here’s one, here’s another.	Kaypi huk, kaypi huk.
But that won’t be a good thing.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanqa.
I feel better now, I feel better	Kunanqa allintam tarikuni, aswan allintam tarikuni
That shouldn’t be that hard.	Chayqa manan chhayna sasachu kanan.
And that’s what he meant.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munarqan.
He thought it best not to do so.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi mana chayta ruwayqa aswan allin kananpaq.
I did something right	Imatapas allintam ruwarqani
I don’t see why that would be the case.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa chayna kananta.
I would disagree with that	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopichu kayman
Here's how you can too.	Kaypi imaynatam qampas ruwawaq.
You mean to do it.	Chayta ruwanaykipaqmi niyta munanki.
I couldn't stand them	Chaykunataqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu
I know it’s recent	Yachanin chayllaraq kashasqanmanta
I can't hold it anymore	Manañam hapiyta atiymanchu
In fact, it’s great.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allinmi.
I fear the worst thing that could ever happen tomorrow	Manchakuni aswan mana allin kaq paqarin haykapipas pasananta
I know this is the best thing for me.	Yachanim kayqa ñuqapaq aswan allin kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t do that to him.	Chaytaqa manan paytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
I guess I can't get hold of it	Ichapas manam chaymanta hapiyta atinichu
A few times actually	Iskay kimsa kutita chiqaptaqa
Not so sure he did.	Mana ancha segurochu kani chay ruwasqanmanta.
It was certainly bigger.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan hatun karqan.
For example,.	Kay hina,.
I was the best one.	Ñuqam allin kaq karqani.
For a while no one said anything.	Huk tiempon mana pipas imatapas nirqanchu.
What did I do with it? 	¿Imatam ruwarqani?
'nothing'.	'mana imapas'.
He was badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa karqan.
I never wanted to do this either	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas kayta ruwayta munarqanichu
I’ve been there a long time	Unayñan chaypi kashani
I didn’t think it could get any worse	Manam yuyaykurqanichu aswan mana allin kananta
I know you are up to the task	Yachanim chay ruwayman hina kasqaykita
I am a good young man now.	Kunanqa allin wayna kani.
Maybe you know something, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas imatapas yachanki, ichapas mana yachankichu.
I don't think it ever will	Manam piensanichu haykapipas chayna kananta
It was a great day.	Hatun p’unchaymi karqan.
I haven't seen him in years	Achka watañam mana paytaqa rikurqanichu
Some truth there, you know.	Chaypi wakin chiqap kaqta, yachanki.
And that’s exactly what we did.	Hinaspa chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqayku.
But of course that will never happen.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana hayk’aqpas chayqa kanqachu.
The act itself does not matter.	Kikin ruwayqa manam imananpaschu.
But you learned quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan yacharqanki.
Nothing was right anymore.	Manañam imapas allinchu karqa.
That’s more.	Chayqa aswan.
I think that would be a good thing	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispaymi
Why is it.	Imaraykutaq.
Two people were injured	Iskay runakunam k’irisqa karqanku
There was no reason he should have.	Manan imaraykupas chayta ruwanan karqanchu.
That he was a very strong man.	Ancha sinchi runa kasqanmanta.
He got out of there as soon as he could.	Atisqanman hinam chaymanta lluqsirqa.
I had to have that positive attitude.	Chay allin yuyayniyuqmi kanay karqa.
I know you can do this	Yachanim kayta ruwayta atisqaykita
I think he’s young	Yuyaykuni wayna kashasqanmanta
The adults are not here.	Kuraq runakunaqa manam kaypichu kachkanku.
Now, there is something here.	Kunanqa, kaypiqa imapas kanmi.
I can't believe they're really mine	Manam creeyta atinichu chiqaptapuni ñuqapa kasqankuta
But people disagreed with me.	Ichaqa manan ñoqawanqa runakunaqa acuerdopichu karqanku.
I was lucky there.	Chaypiqa suerteyoqmi karqani.
She thought maybe it was the man	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ichapas chay runa kanman nispa
I was very happy.	Sinchi kusisqan karqani.
I can’t do that to him	Chaytaqa manam paytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu
Actually, maybe not.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas mana.
I don't see anything there.	Chaypiqa manam imatapas rikunichu.
Perhaps he is right.	Yaqapaschá payqa allinta rimachkan.
I mean one.	Niyta munani huk.
I just didn’t know how he was going to do it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imayna ruwananta
That was about right.	Chayqa yaqa allinmi karqa.
Now that is a great thing to do, but it is a difficult thing to do.	Kunanqa chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi, ichaqa sasa ruwaymi.
So happy for you.	Chaymi kusisqa qanpaq.
I am a very important person	Ancha importante runan kani
He doesn’t want to talk to you.	Payqa manan qanwan rimayta munanchu.
Either.	Utaq.
You want to know, okay.	Yachayta munanki, allinmi.
It is better to do so.	Aswan allinmi chay hinata ruwayqa.
I can't do anything about them.	Chaykunataqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu.
That’s you and me, now.	Chayqa qamwan ñuqawan, kunanqa.
And that’s what I am.	Hinaspa chaymi ñoqaqa kani.
So, that was interesting.	Chaymi, chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
This one thing, no.	Kay huknin kaq, mana.
That’s all there was to it.	Chayllam chaypi karqa.
This was the first problem.	Kaymi ñawpaq sasachakuy karqan.
I need something more	Astawan imatapas necesitasaq
I can’t deal with it now	Kunanqa manan chayta atipayta atiymanchu
I didn’t want to have sex with him	Manam paywan puñuyta munarqanichu
I know you will do your best	Yachanin tukuy atisqaykita ruwanaykipaq
How does he know that.	Imaynataq chayta yachan.
I wasn't really too sure about this	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu kaymanta seguro karqani
I did nothing there	Chaypiqa manan ima ruwaytapas ruwarqanichu
It could be very bad, it could be good.	Ancha mana allin kanman, allin kanman.
Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayqa mana allinchu karqa.
He knows that, but he doesn’t know how.	Chaytaqa yachan, ichaqa manan yachanchu imaynatachus chayta yachan.
I wonder why that is, now.	Tapukuni imaraykutaq chayna kasqanmanta, kunanqa.
Something you have to do for me.	Imapas ñuqapaq ruwanayki.
I just know he’s angry	Chaylla yachani phiñasqa kasqanmanta
He had no idea what was in it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imakuna chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I wanted to see what it was like	Imayna kasqanmantam qawayta munarqani
He knew what was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus kananta.
But no one knew exactly what it was.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yacharqan imachus kasqanmanta.
I think that’s huge	Chayqa hatunmi nispaymi yuyaykuni
That's how he wants to work with me.	Chaynatam ñuqawan llamkayta munan.
He asked me the question.	Paymi tapuwarqa.
Everyone is very angry now	Kunanqa llapa runam ancha phiñasqa kachkan
The wise man.	Chay yachaysapa runa.
But it’s a human being	Ichaqa huk runa
I want to go with that	Chaywanmi riyta munani
I can’t believe it’s true	Manan creeyta atiymanchu cheqaq kasqanta
I thought this was strange	Kayqa mana riqsisqa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
So this is it.	Chaymi kayqa.
I can’t hear anything	Manam imatapas uyariyta atinichu
I want to see something very soon.	Ancha utqaylla imapas qawayta munani.
I had a bad attitude	Mana allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani
I thought something was very, very wrong	Imapas ancha, ancha mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
It wasn’t funny	Manam asikunapaq hinachu karqa
But this is never, ever true.	Ichaqa kayqa manan hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu.
I knew he knew more.	Yacharqanim astawan yachasqanmanta.
I don’t want any better.	Manam aswan allinqa munanichu.
He could do nothing for her.	Manam imatapas paypaq ruwayta atirqachu.
He knows what you look like.	Payqa yachanmi imayna rikchayniyuq kasqaykita.
I wasn’t sure what he meant	Mana segurochu karqani ima niyta munasqanmanta
It felt like a mistake.	Chayqa pantasqa hinam tarikurqa.
We cannot find him.	Paytaqa manam tariyta atichwanchu.
I’m really looking forward to the challenge	Chiqamanta suyachkani chay sasachakuy
I was just so tired	Chayllam ancha sayk’usqa karqani
One with him.	Huknin paywan.
I think you can say yes	Yuyaykuni arí niyta atisqaykita
Someone said something.	Pipas imatapas nisqa.
I mean nothing happened.	Niyta munani mana imapas pasasqanmanta.
You’re the guy.	Qanmi kanki chay runa.
This is where the mistake lies.	Kaypim pantasqa kachkan.
It's like being there again.	Hukmanta chaypi kay hinam.
He said he wanted to talk.	Rimayta munan nispa.
I knew what was going on there	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta
Obviously this takes some practice.	Sut’inmi kayqa wakin ruwayta munan.
I couldn’t walk fast enough	Manam utqaylla puriyta atirqanichu
I really hope he’s not mad at me	Chiqamanta suyachkani mana ñuqawan phiñasqa kananta
I've always been a little bit like that	Sapa kutim huk chikan chayna karqani
Why was it happening? 	¿Imanasqataq chayna kachkarqa?
That’s pretty big.	Chayqa allin hatunmi.
I can't stand being alone, you know that	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu sapallay kayta, chaytaqa yachanki
He looked really crazy.	Payqa chiqap loco hinam rikchakurqa.
Isn’t that the only thing.	Manachu chaylla.
Sure he does.	Seguro payqa ruwan.
I couldn’t wait to get out there	Manam suyayta atirqanichu chaypi lluqsiyta
The teacher is wrong.	Yachachiqmi pantasqa.
I thought so, anyway	Chaynatam piensarqani, imayna kaptinpas
I wasn’t really happy about it	Manam chiqap kusisqachu karqani chaymanta
He is not the right person for you.	Payqa manam qampaq hinachu.
That’s what he thought of her.	Chaytan paymanta yuyaykurqan.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allin.
I couldn't do that to him	Chaytaqa manam paytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I found out about this half an hour ago	Kaymantaqa kuskan hora ñawpaqtaraqmi yacharqani
I hope to sleep well	Suyachkani allinta puñuyta
I hope he isn’t mad at me	Suyachkani mana ñuqawan phiñasqa kananta
I didn’t want to go to another school	Manam huk yachay wasiman riyta munarqanichu
I was with him every day	Sapa punchawmi paywan karqani
I really mean it.	Chiqaptam niyta munani.
Both of them are.	Iskayninkum.
I really want to get a better job	Chiqaptam munani aswan allin llamkayta tariyta
I can't handle everything	Manan tukuy imatapas hap'iyta atiymanchu
It’s not like any other.	Manam huk hinachu.
! 	!
I said yes and he went from there	Arí nispaymi chaymanta rirqa
I’m a good player.	Allin pukllaqmi kani.
No one is sure.	Mana pipas segurochu.
I couldn’t believe this would happen again	Mana creeyta atirqanichu kay hukmanta pasananta
This is very important to me.	Kayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
I haven’t seen it here yet, not yet	Manaraqmi kaypi rikunichu, manaraqmi
I want it all to myself this morning	Kunan paqarin tukuyta ñuqapaq munani
You’re doing something.	Imatapas ruwachkanki.
I used to teach it	Chaytaqa yachachiq kani
I am still the same today	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkani
I hope it is, there	Suyachkani chayna kasqanmanta, chaypi
I couldn’t remember what happened	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
I saw it very truly	Ancha chiqaptam rikurqani
I know you are not happy here	Yachanim kaypi mana kusisqachu kasqaykita
I can't sleep tonight	Kunan tutaqa manam puñuyta atinichu
I had no idea if it was day or night	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani sichus punchaw utaq tuta kasqanmanta
He was very serious.	Payqa ancha serio karqan.
But it probably should be.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna kanan.
I don't know when that will happen.	Manam yachanichu haykapi chayna kananta.
I kept trying, but nothing worked	Hinallam kallpanchakurqani, ichaqa manam imapas allinchu karqa
I do, of course.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, chiqamanta.
I didn’t hear or see anything	Manam imatapas uyarirqanichu nitaq rikurqanichu
He just got out of there	Chayllaraqmi chaymanta lluqsirqa
That was certainly appreciated.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allinpaq qhawarisqa karqan.
Now I was serious.	Kunanqa serio karqani.
I want it bad, but it can't be good	Mana allintam munani, ichaqa manam allinchu kanman
I wasn't sure about this	Kaymantaqa manam segurochu karqani
In fact, twice before.	Chiqamanta, iskay kuti ñawpaqta.
I was very happy, to be honest	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani, chiqap kaptinqa
Very cold and .	Ancha chiri hinaspa .
It wasn’t the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu karqa.
I know it won't be easy	Yachanim mana facilchu kananta
I haven’t heard of him	Manam paymanta uyarirqanichu
He must continue to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanan.
But I don’t know why	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku
I knew this was coming	Yacharqanim kay hamunanta
I know what he wants to do	Yachanim ima ruwaytapas munasqanmanta
It makes sense of everything.	Tukuy imamanta yuyayniyuqmi.
I’m so hurt	Anchatan k’irisqa kashani
I couldn’t tell either	Ñuqapas manam willayta atirqanichu
The first thing he had to do.	Ñawpaq kaq imatachus ruwanan karqan.
I just didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Chaylla manaña paywan rimayta munarqanichu
I really want to go.	Anchatan munani riyta.
I can sit with you, if you want	Qanwan tiyayta atiyman, munaspaqa
That 's a big deal	Chayqa hatunmi .
I should have done better.	Aswan allintam ruwanay karqa.
He never said much about it being so.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas anchatachu rimarqan chhayna kasqanmantaqa.
Or three people.	Utaq kimsa runakuna.
You play every other night out here.	Kay hawapi sapa iskay tuta pukllayta ruwanki.
Someone to make a statement.	Pipas willakuyta ruwananpaq.
I wish you were there	Chaypi kasqaykita munayman
I did the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan ruwarqan.
That’s probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá kanman.
I very much hope he does	Anchatam suyachkani chayta ruwananpaq
That wasn’t such a bad thing.	Chayqa manan chhayna mana allinchu karqan.
It’s not really about who’s the best.	Manam chiqaptachu pikuna aswan allin kasqanmanta rimachkan.
I didn’t expect it	Manam suyarqanichu
It will be the best thing ever	Aswan allin kaqmi kanqa haykapipas
But that was a very long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha unayñan karqan.
I thought that would be nice	Chaywanqa sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I think he’s going there now	Yuyaykuni kunan chayman risqanmanta
That's nice anyway	Chayqa sumaqmi imayna kaptinpas
He didn’t know she was there.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I feel so stupid right now.	Kunanqa ancha sonso hinam tarikuni.
I know he did what he wanted	Yachanim munasqanman hina ruwasqanmanta
So he immediately started walking towards it.	Chaymi chaylla chayman puriyta qallaykurqa.
I thought there was more	Aswan achka kasqanmantam piensarqani
That would be a little too sad.	Chayqa huk chikan ancha llakikuypaqmi kanman.
You’ve done this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytan ruwarqanki.
I repeat the process	Chay ruwayta yapamanta ruwani
I didn’t want to see anyone now	Manam kunanqa pitapas rikuyta munarqanichu
Like he’d never lived there.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaypi tiyaq hina.
I can’t help it, really	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa
I have to make lunch	Almuerzota ruwanay tiyan
I’m actually very, very hungry	Chiqamanta ancha, ancha yarqasqa kani
This probably has another name since it’s so easy.	Kayqa ichapas huk sutiyuq kanman ancha facil kasqanmanta pacha.
I do well with that	Chaywanmi allinta ruwani
Never thought of doing anything else.	Mana hayk’aqpas huk ruwayta yuyaykurqanchu.
Maybe I like this one	Ichapas kayta gustan
Now I can stop this silly job	Kunanqa kay mana yuyayniyuq llamk’ayta saqiyta atiyman
He was there first, that morning.	Payqa ñawpaqta chaypi karqan, chay paqarin.
Maybe they were too busy with me	Ichapas ñuqawan llumpay ocupasqa karqaku
It was that simple	Chay hina facilmi karqan
All right, whatever.	Allinmi, imapas.
But he’s here with me again tonight.	Ichaqa kunan tutan yapamanta kaypi kashan ñoqawan.
All this wonderful knowledge.	Tukuy kay sumaq yachay.
I had to make sure it was real	Chiqap kasqanmantam seguro kanay karqa
I couldn’t tell who he was.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu pi kasqanmanta.
He had to be crazy.	Payqa loco kanan karqan.
I can't understand why	Manam entiendeyta atinichu imanasqa chaytaqa
I am a teacher, after all	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kani, tukuy imamanta
I didn’t want to walk anymore	Manañam puriyta munarqanichu
He wasn’t here yet.	Payqa manaraqmi kaypichu karqan.
I knew he wasn't coming	Yacharqanim manaña hamunanta
If only he could get outside.	Sichus hawaman lluqsiyta atinman karqan chayqa.
I hadn’t thought of this	Kaytaqa manam yuyaykurqanichu
He didn't care about that.	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
It seems so stupid though	Chayna sonso hinam ichaqa
This is actually a good thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi.
I want to know about this happening	Kay pasasqanmanta yachayta munani
He was never like this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu karqan.
I couldn’t let him go home	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu wasiman rinanpaq
This process was the best.	Kay ruwayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Something stupid, really.	Imapas sonso, chiqap.
I don't see anything here	Kaypiqa manam imatapas rikunichu
So proud to have done that.	Chaymi orgulloso chayta ruwasqaymanta.
But at least I knew you existed	Ichaqa yaqapaschá yacharqani kasqaykita
I mean, he’s a really good guy	Niyta munani, payqa chiqap allin runam
One thing is for sure.	Huk kaqmi seguro.
It's pretty obvious.	Allin sut'inmi.
I haven't seen him in many years, you know	Achka watañam mana rikurqanichu, yachanki
He is well aware of the consequences.	Payqa allintam yachan chay ruwasqanmanta imakuna pasananta.
I couldn’t understand what it was	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu ima kasqanmanta
That was how he was sure.	Chaynatam payqa seguro karqa.
Right now, it's just not there yet.	Kunanqa, chaylla manaraq chaypichu kachkan.
I can't remember where it was	Manañam yuyariyta atinichu maypi kasqanmanta
Obviously I was very wrong	Sut’inmi ancha pantasqa kasqayta
First, they are much larger.	Ñawpaqtaqa, aswan hatunmi kanku.
I know about everything	Tukuy imamanta yachani
A very useful knowledge	Huk ancha allin yachay
I was there that day	Chay punchawmi chaypi karqani
I couldn’t believe he would do that	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna ruwananta
In fact, we didn’t talk much about anything.	Aswanpas manan imamantapas anchatachu rimaq kayku.
This is exclusion itself.	Kayqa kikin qarqusqa kaymi.
It was rather unfortunate.	Aswan llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I want to do it here	Kaypi ruwayta munani
I knew it was foolish	Yacharqanim mana yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta
I was actually kind of surprised that it happened.	Chiqaptaqa huk laya admirasqa karqani chay pasasqanmanta.
There was this whole crazy thing.	Kay tukuy loco kaqmi karqa.
Tomorrow if you want.	Paqarin munaspaqa.
This was the most important thing.	Kaymi aswan allinqa karqan.
I couldn’t help but wonder why	Manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I’ve seen it before	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaytaqa rikurqani
I wonder what they want from him	Tapukuni imataq paymanta munanku
Now you can do that.	Kunanqa chaynatam ruwawaq.
Okay, that seems pretty bad.	Allinmi, chayqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
I had no idea what was going on	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
But that doesn’t matter, after all.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu, tukuy imamanta.
Maybe just in time.	Ichapas tiempollanpi.
After that, it’s no big deal.	Chay qhepamanmi mana hatun ruwaychu.
I don’t know much about it.	Manam anchatachu yachani.
If you want to do it, do it.	Ruwayta munanki chayqa, ruway.
The first thing we did.	Ñawpaq kaqmi ruwarqayku.
I am such a person.	Chayna runam kani.
This wasn’t the case.	Manan kaychu karqan.
It’s a really nice night	Chiqamanta sumaq tuta
So he went there.	Chaymi chayman rirqa.
And that it just didn’t feel right.	Hinaspa chaylla mana allintachu sientekusqanmanta.
It really doesn’t make sense here anymore	Chiqaptaqa manañam kaypiqa imapaqpas valenchu
I can’t be good or bad	Manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kayman
Do what you want to do.	Ruway munasqaykita ruway.
It’s better than good.	Aswan allinmi allin kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t help it either	Ñoqapas manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu
There is nothing there for you.	Chaypiqa manam imapas qampaq kanchu.
And go big.	Hinaspa hatun riy.
Maybe he wouldn’t do that.	Ichapas mana chayta ruwanmanchu.
Which isn’t a bad thing.	Imataq mana mana allinchu.
I could have done that very easily too	Ñuqapas ancha facilmi chaytaqa ruwayman karqa
Does that make sense?.	¿Chayqa imapaqpas allinchu?.
I thought about that for a while	Chaypin huk rato yuyaykurqani
I didn’t know the language	Manam chay simitaqa yacharqanichu
I didn’t want to remember	Manam yuyariyta munarqanichu
You are doing a very good job.	Ancha allintam ruwachkanki.
That was about an hour ago.	Chayqa yaqa huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
The first two.	Ñawpaq kaq iskay.
I don’t really know what’s going to happen.	Manam allintachu yachani imakuna pasananta.
You do this, he says.	Kayta ruwanki, nispas nin.
It does many things well.	Achka ruwaykunata allinta ruwan.
It seemed like it would help.	Yanapananpaq hinam rikchakurqa.
I’ll need it later	Qhepamanmi necesitasaq
I don't know why	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I knew what this was	Yacharqanim ima kayqa kasqanmanta
I shouldn’t be happy	Manam kusisqachu kanay
I tried to remember everything, but I couldn't	Tukuy imatam yuyariyta munarqani, ichaqa manam atirqanichu
I saw that coming.	Chay hamunanta rikurqani.
This is very.	Kayqa ancha.
Or something out here.	Utaq imapas kay hawapi.
Nothing makes sense.	Imapas manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I was drunk that night too.	Ñoqapas chay tutan machasqa karqani.
I still don't know how it happened.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imayna pasasqanmanta.
I can do it after that	Chay qhepamanmi ruwayta atiyman
He wants something.	Payqa imatapas munanmi.
Say you want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munasqaykita niy.
You were always too good for me.	Sapa kutim ñuqapaq llumpay allin karqanki.
I really think this will help	Chiqaptam piensani kayqa yanapananta
Isn’t that the truth.	¿Manachu chayqa cheqaq kaq.
I want everything to be okay	Tukuy imapas allin kananta munani
If only he were here.	Sichus kaypi kanman karqan chayqa.
I do things like he does	Pay hinam imatapas ruwani
I could do that all day	Chaytaqa tukuy punchawmi ruwayman karqa
We did some things.	Wakin ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
Yes, maybe it is.	Arí, ichapas chayna kanman.
I think that's part of it.	Chayqa chaymanta kasqanmantam piensani.
It’s better this way.	Aswan allinmi kay hinaqa.
For the most part, it was easy.	Yaqa llapanpim mana sasachu karqa.
Obviously that’s not what I wanted	Sut’inmi mana chaytachu munarqani
That’s the last step.	Chayqa qhipa kaq ruwaymi.
It’s intelligent.	Yuyayniyuqmi.
So far I am doing pretty well.	Kunankamaqa allintam ruwachkani.
It was a few years later.	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi karqan.
And this is it.	Hinaspa kay.
Yes, wrongdoing can be good.	Arí, mana allin ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
I had no idea he was coming here	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kayman hamunanta
She was a beautiful young woman.	Payqa sumaq sipasmi karqan.
People are human beings.	Runakunaqa runam.
I really didn’t know	Chiqaptaqa manam yacharqanichu
It's really quite a big crowd here.	Chiqaptam kaypiqa ancha hatun achka runakuna.
Problems at home.	Wasipi sasachakuy.
But he didn’t mean it.	Ichaqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
Perhaps there was nothing he could do	Ichapas mana ima ruwaytapas atirqachu
I didn’t think it was coming	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chay hamunanta
Does anyone know how to do this.	¿Pipas yachanchu kayta ruwanapaq imayna kasqanmanta.
But it will be good	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa
I’m sure you’ll agree with me on that.	Seguro kani chaymanta ñuqawan acuerdopi kanki.
All day, every day.	Tukuy punchaw, sapa punchaw.
I think he’s happy.	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
He did just that.	Payqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
So this is rich.	Chaymi kayqa qhapaq.
Not in the school.	Yachay wasipi mana.
But it’s worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi.
I’m not sure why he did that.	Manam segurochu kani imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I anticipate that it might be more difficult	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yuyaykuni aswan sasa kanman chayta
I couldn’t do anything else	Manam hukta ruwayta atirqanichu
I know too much	Llumpay achkatam yachani
I have been waiting for a year	Huk watañam suyachkani
He has a great mind.	Payqa hatun yuyayniyuqmi.
But I never knew that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yacharqanichu
We had to do this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanayku karqa.
I couldn’t let this happen again	Manam hukmanta kay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu
It was a crazy time.	Chayqa loco tiempon karqan.
He didn’t want to think about anything.	Payqa manan imatapas yuyaymanayta munarqanchu.
I do that so very well	Chayna ancha allintam chaytaqa ruwani
He is there, here.	Payqa chaypim kachkan, kaypi.
It’s not easy.	Manan facilchu.
Something just happened.	Imapas chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
I thought that was too much	Chayqa llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani
But I want to know a little bit	Ichaqa huk chhikantan yachayta munani
I wasn’t ready for that	Chaypaqqa manan listochu karqani
I was sick and worried about you	Qanmanta unqusqa llakisqa karqani
You will do it today.	Kunan punchawmi ruwanki.
I didn’t know what he meant.	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I wanted to capture it all	Tukuy chayta hap’iyta munarqani
And he was very busy at the time.	Hinaspa chay tiempopiqa ancha ocupasqa kasharqan.
No, it wasn’t.	Manan, manan karqanchu.
I wasn’t there anymore.	Manañam karqani.
I love being with you	Anchatan gustan qanwan kayqa
And that was really good, actually.	Hinaspa chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
I couldn't get home tonight	Kunan tutaqa manam wasiyman chayayta atirqanichu
More about me.	Astawan ñuqamanta.

They had nowhere to go.	Manam maymanpas rinanpaq hinachu karqaku.
Find out what that is.	Imataq chay kasqanmanta yachay.
There are ten so far.	Kunankamaqa chunka kan.
If he did, it was too bad.	Sichus chayta ruwarqan chayqa, nishuta mana allinmi karqan.
He was a wise man.	Payqa yachaysapa runam karqa.
I made quick work of it	Chaywanmi utqaylla llamkayta ruwarqani
I know he wants me to	Yachanim chayta ruwanayta munasqanmanta
I’m sure he’d agree	Seguro kani payqa acuerdopi kananta
But it’s been a very long time.	Ichaqa ancha unayñan.
Not sure of it.	Mana segurochu.
They are very good people.	Paykunaqa ancha allin runakunam.
I always have time constraints.	Sapa kutim tiempo sasachakuypi tarikuni.
I was happy to be there.	Chaypim kusisqa tarikurqani.
He was twice married.	Payqa iskay kutitan casarasqa karqan.
That’s how I can do it	Chaynatam ruwayman
They want to talk all the time.	Tukuy tiempo rimayta munanku.
I’m not sure about that yet.	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
But that didn't matter.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu karqan.
Two years later, he was uncertain.	Iskay wata qhepamanmi manaña segurochu karqan.
Unfortunately, there is nothing.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam imapas kanchu.
Just once, that was a very long time ago.	Huk kutilla, chayqa ancha unayñan karqan.
I said thank you but no thank you	Gracias nispaymi nirqani ichaqa manam gracias nispa
I was just there.	Chayraqmi karqani.
All right, there you go.	Allinmi, chaypi rinki.
I couldn't remember when it was	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu haykapi kasqanmanta
I often wonder what he is doing now	Sapa kutim tapukuni kunan ima ruwasqanmanta
I knew that all along	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon yacharqani
I have never been there before	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa rirqanichu
I think he was worried about me	Yuyaykuni ñoqamanta llakisqa kashasqanmanta
It just sort of happened	Chaylla huk laya pasarqa
It's not ready.	Manam listochu kachkan.
That wasn’t always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I wanted to ask if.	Tapuyta munarqani sichus.
But here it is.	Ichaqa kaypi.
I didn’t know what was wrong	Manam ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa yacharqanichu
I’m very good at this	Kaypiqa ancha allinmi kani
I couldn’t go anywhere	Manam maymanpas riyta atirqanichu
He sensed it had to be someone else.	Payqa repararqanmi huk runa kananta.
I couldn't believe he actually did this	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqaptapuni kayta ruwasqanpi
I still don't know why.	Manam kunankamapas yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really couldn't believe it.	Chiqaptaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
I probably don’t agree with anyone about everything.	Manachá piwanpas acuerdopichu kani tukuy imamanta.
I’m afraid of everything	Tukuy imatam manchakuni
Yes, it is there.	Arí, chaypim kachkan.
Very much.	Anchata.
Now he realized that this was not the case.	Kunanqa repararqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want him to come back.	Manam munarqanichu kutimunanta.
Many walking wounded.	Achka puriq k’irisqa.
But I never did that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu
No, three times.	Manan, kinsa kutita.
I was, however, glad he wasn't here now.	Ñuqam ichaqa kusisqa karqani kunan mana kaypi kasqanmanta.
I’m afraid of that guy for something	Chay wayna imapaqpas manchakuni
That he wasn't there that night.	Chay tuta mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
You can never know.	Manam haykapipas yachayta atiwaqchu.
The first is multitasking.	Ñawpaq kaqmi achka ruwaykunata ruway.
Now was the moment.	Kunanqa chay rato karqan.
I don’t know about being drunk.	Manam yachanichu machasqa kaymanta.
This was a good while ago.	Kayqa allin tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
This was not an accomplishment.	Kayqa manam huk ruwaychu karqa.
Not that long.	Mana chay unaytachu.
It was about three o'clock in the morning.	Chayqa kimsa hora tutamanta hinam karqa.
I saw the future	Hamuq tiempotan rikurqani
It’s actually really good.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta allin.
I feel really sad and uncomfortable, actually	Chiqamanta llakisqa, mana allinta ima sientekuni, chiqamanta
I didn’t know how to do that	Manam chayta ruwayta yacharqanichu
A couple of months at most	Huk iskay killa aswan achka
Little else was wrong with that.	Chaymanta pisi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I didn’t do much of it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu chaytaqa ruwarqani
You really think nothing can be too bad.	Chiqamanta yuyanki mana imapas llumpay mana allinchu kanman.
Older than you	Qammanta aswan kuraq
And the baby.	Hinaspa wawa.
Twice.	Iskay kuti.
I would be so happy and not so stupid	Ancha kusisqam kayman hinaspa mana ancha sonso kayman
Maybe he can’t hear or understand.	Ichapas mana uyariyta nitaq entiendeyta atinchu.
But he knew, in fact, that it was nothing more.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi, cheqaqtapuni, mana imapas aswan kasqanmanta.
I'll do it right	Allintam ruwasaq
I’ve never been there.	Manam haykapipas rirqanichu.
But then he didn't think so.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
He's got it right.	Payqa allintam hapisqa.
Say that it needs to be done.	Niy chayta ruwana kasqanmanta.
I wasn’t a nice person	Manam sumaq runachu karqani
He’s actually the best.	Payqa chiqaptaqa aswan allinmi.
I would be a human being	Huk runam kayman
But that would take some action.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa wakin ruwaymi kanman.
I didn’t have much to tell you	Manam anchatachu willanaypaq karqa
I can't sit here all day	Manam tukuy punchaw kaypi tiyayta atiymanchu
He can't go.	Payqa manam riyta atinchu.
I don’t know what the fuck they are.	Mana yachanichu ima millay kasqankuta.
The worst thing in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan mana allin kaq.
I'm tired of it.	Sayk'usqañan kashani.
He was quick.	Payqa utqayllam karqa.
I can’t sleep anymore	Manañam puñuyta atinichu
Most people know that.	Chaytaqa yaqa llapan runakunam yachanku.
Probably the largest and most beautiful in the world.	Yaqapaschá kay pachapi aswan hatun, aswan sumaq rikchayniyuq.
Once upon a time, a year .	Huk kutipi, huk wata .
I knew that right away.	Chaytaqa chayllam yacharqani.
I mean it wasn’t like him	Niyta munani mana pay hinachu karqan
I mean are you really ready	Niyta munani chiqaptachu listo kachkanki
I don’t really feel very comfortable.	Manam chiqaptaqa ancha allinchu tarikuni.
You’re happy to be there.	Kusisqam kachkanki.
I know this is going to happen	Yachanim kayqa kananta
This would be wrong to say.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman niyta.
This was actually a good thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi karqa.
I didn’t want to say any more.	Manañam astawan rimayta munarqanichu.
Maybe in an ideal world.	Ichapas huk allin pachapi chayna kanman.
It was a miserable day.	Chay punchawqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
That’s what it is.	Chayqa kanmi.
So this week, there's more.	Chaymi kay semanapi, aswan achka kachkan.
The people were not happy	Runakunaqa manam kusisqachu karqaku
And that’s how it was supposed to be.	Hinaspa chhayna kanan karqan.
Or last night or tomorrow night.	Utaq qayna tuta utaq paqarin tuta.
Everyone knows how to play.	Tukuy runa pukllayta yachanku.
I don’t know anything, I didn’t do anything	Manam imatapas yachanichu, manam imatapas ruwarqanichu
He wasn’t sure he liked it.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan gustasqanmanta.
I can't imagine what this is about	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imamanta kayqa kasqanmanta
I wish I could talk every night	Munaymanmi sapa tuta rimayta
It’s now.	Kunanmi.
Obviously that means something.	Sut’inmi chayqa imatapas niyta munan.
She wanted to look pretty today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi sumaq rikchayniyuq kayta munarqa.
It wasn’t like it is now.	Manam kunan hinachu karqa.
I would love to see it	Anchatam munani chayta qawayta
No one knew he was here.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu kaypi kashasqanmanta.
It was going to be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanan karqa.
That’s the beauty.	Chayqa sumaq kaymi.
I can't do that from here.	Chaytaqa manam kaymantaqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
I can’t always do that	Manam sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwayman
They were pretty confused.	Paykunaqa sumaq pantasqa karqanku.
I didn’t want to think things through	Manam imatapas allinta yuyaymanayta munarqanichu
I didn’t see it anymore to pretend	Manañam rikurqanichu hina ruwanaypaq
That's what one of them said.	Chayqa hukninmi nirqa.
I wonder if he knows how beautiful it is	Tapukuni sichus yachan imayna sumaq kasqanmanta
I wasn’t surprised	Manam admirakurqanichu
I have no idea what he did there.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani chaypi ima ruwasqanmanta.
I’ve seen it before.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaytaqa rikurqani.
I was early enough.	Ñuqaqa temprano karqani.
I was one of them	Hukninmi karqani
It’s not like anywhere else.	Manam maypi hinachu kachkan.
I was very impressed	Ñuqaqa anchatam admirakurqani
Maybe you can do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwawaq.
He tried to make it work.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi chayta allinta ruwananpaq.
I’m not good enough for you	Manam qampaq allinchu kani
I haven’t seen that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
Black or something black.	Yana utaq imapas yana.
More like a twentieth more.	Aswan iskay chunka kaq hina aswan.
I hope he was okay with her	Suyachkani paywan allin kasqanmanta
He is a man of good sense.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuq runam.
You never know what the weather is going to be like.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imayna tiempo kananta.
I just had to make sure it wasn't going to be me	Chayllaraqmi seguro kanay karqa mana ñuqachu kananmanta
I'd be caught.	Hap'isqa kayman.
A year ago it would have been easy	Huk wata ñawpaqtaqa facilmi kanman karqa
He wants to play badly.	Mana allinta pukllayta munan.
I mean, really crazy.	Niyta munani, chiqap loco.
The man is right.	Chay runaqa allintam rimachkan.
And that’s very difficult.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha sasa.
He was angry and hurt.	Payqa phiñasqa, k’irisqa kasqa.
It just didn’t go well.	Chaylla mana allintachu rirqa.
I need to be better than that	Chaymanta aswan allin kaytam necesitasaq
I know you want to have sex with me	Yachanim ñuqawan puñuyta munasqaykita
It would mean something.	Imapas niyta munanman.
But I couldn’t tell you that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa willayta atirqanichu
I couldn't disagree more	Manam aswan mana acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu
I just thought, you know .	Chaylla yuyaykurqani, yachanki .
That this house really will be people like.	Chay kay wasi chiqap kanqa runakuna imayna.
I thought you wanted to be alone	Yuyarqanim sapallayki kayta munasqaykita
I hope it’s something good for me	Suyachkani imapas allin kaqta ñuqapaq kananpaq
So far I’ve been easy	Kunankamaqa facilmi karqani
Not much, anymore.	Mana anchatachu, manaña.
It was the girl.	Chay sipasmi karqan.

I want to be human again.	Hukmanta runa kaytam munani.

He had to be here soon or he would never be able to go.	Usqhaylla kaypi kanan karqan mana chayqa manan hayk’aqpas riyta atinmanchu.
I didn't expect it to be so fast	Manam suyarqanichu chayna utqaylla kananta

I wanted to ask about that	Chaymantam tapuyta munarqani
I don't remember his name anymore	Manañam sutinta yuyarinichu
They are not	Paykunaqa manan .
I don’t know why, or ever.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa, nitaq haykapipas.
He’s not who he told you he was.	Payqa manan pichus nisurqanki hinachu.
I think that’s got to be a good thing	Chayqa allin kaqmi kanan, nispaymi yuyaykuni
I know you had a rough couple of years	Yachanim iskay kimsa wata sasachakuypi kasqaykita
I don't know if you know this.	Mana yachanichu kayta yachanki icha manachu.
A few hours later, he was unable to speak.	Iskay kinsa hora qhepamanmi manaña rimayta atirqanchu.
This required urgency.	Chaypaqqa usqhayllan ruwana karqan.
I didn’t think you could do this	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqaykita
I am very happy and very proud.	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa ancha orgulloso kani.
He is happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kachkan.

He was angry about something.	Payqa imamantapas phiñasqa kasqa.
It was a great opportunity for that.	Chaypaqqa ancha allinmi karqa.

I was as surprised as he was	Ñuqapas pay hinam admirakurqani
But they are not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kanku.
But no one wanted to come.	Ichaqa manan pipas hamuyta munarqanchu.

That’s the way it is.	Chayqa hinam.
But it wouldn’t be much longer.	Ichaqa manan aswan unaytachu kanman.

It is likely that this person will be attractive and attractive.	Yaqapaschá kay runaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq hinaspa sumaq rikchayniyuq kanqa.

Sounds like a little bit.	Huk chikan hinam uyarikun.

It’s not a good day.	Mana allin punchawchu.
I want to believe that.	Chayta creeyta munani.
I don’t want to be here either.	Ñuqapas manam kaypi kayta munanichu.
I thought that said a lot.	Chayqa achkatam nirqa nispaymi piensarqani.
Describe the characteristics.	Imayna kasqanmanta willay.
Everyone knows that is not true.	Lliwmi yachanku chay mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
That wasn’t the worst part.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu karqan.
I don’t know how.	Manam yachanichu imaynata.
You don’t really know.	Mana chiqaptachu yachanki.
But he couldn’t eat it.	Ichaqa manan mikhuyta atirqanchu.
Looks good, boy.	Allinmi rikchakun, wayna.
I wasn’t so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu karqani.
Too much, too fast.	Ancha achka, ancha utqaylla.

Everything he said was good.	Tukuy ima nisqanqa allinmi karqan.

That’s the way it is now.	Chay hinallam kunanqa kachkan.

In fact, it would be easy to do so.	Aswanpas chayta ruwayqa facilmi kanman.

So it should be.	Chaymi kanan.
I wanted to ask you something	Imatapas tapuyta munarqani
I said in surprise	nispaymi admirasqa nirqani
But I don’t know why	Ichaqa manan imarayku chaytaqa yachanichu
He walked every morning.	Sapa paqarin puriq.

It’s really a lesson in humanity.	Chiqaptam runa kaymanta yachay.
First year in high school.	Colegiopi ñawpaq wata.
He says you did great.	Paymi nin hatun ruwasqaykita.

Many people were concerned about it	Achka runakunam chaymanta llakisqa karqaku
This is what he told me.	Kaytam niwarqa.

He is not alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu.
That’ll do it.	Chayqa ruwanqa.

I want to, it’s still.	Munani, hinallam.
That’s like here, like here.	Chayqa kaypi hina, kaypi hina.
I wanted to talk to someone	Piwanpas rimayta munarqani
I am still waiting for a job	Hinallam suyachkani huk llamkayta
But tonight he wasn't sure.	Ichaqa kunan tutaqa manan segurochu kasharqan.
But it’s not this guy.	Ichaqa manan kay runachu.
Actually, this is not good.	Chiqaptaqa, kayqa manam allinchu.
I still can't find the solution.	Hinallam mana tariyta atinichu chay allichayta.
I want him to do something outside	Munani hawapi imatapas ruwananta
I don't understand the word here	Kaypiqa manam chay simitaqa entiendenichu
This is everyone.	Kayqa llapa runam.
I know who you are now	Yachanim kunan pi kasqaykita
I knew what you wanted	Yacharqanim ima munasqaykita
There’s someone there.	Chaypim pipas kachkan.
Another school, once.	Huk yachay wasi, huk kuti.
Whether it’s good or not.	Allin kaptinpas mana kaptinpas.
All that beauty.	Tukuy chay sumaq kay.
He couldn't sit still.	Payqa manam tiyayta atirqachu.
But he died last year.	Ichaqa qayna wata wañupurqan.
I haven’t seen that before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaytaqa rikurqanichu
People are there for it.	Runakuna chaypi kachkanku.
But he must act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan.
I think, the sooner, the better	Yuyaykuni, aswan utqaylla, aswan allin
I just know it’s going to be good	Chaylla yachani allin kananta
No one knew for sure.	Manan pipas allintachu yacharqan.
I never thought this day would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kay punchaw pasananta
I knew it would be like this	Yacharqanim kayna kananta
Obviously, he’s been there before.	Sut’inmi, payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi karqan.
He has to do it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwanan.
I can’t do him	Paytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
I didn’t really know what it was called	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima sutiyuq kasqanmanta
He had a history of failure.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi mana allintachu ruwaq.
We hardly ever spoke.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas rimaq kayku.
I was rather annoyed	Ñuqaqa aswan phiñasqa karqani
That.	Chay.
I knew there was no one else here	Yacharqanim kaypiqa mana huk runa kasqanmanta
I really hope you’re nice there	Chiqamanta suyachkani chaypi sumaq kasqaykita
That will be difficult.	Chayqa sasam kanqa.
Time, it seemed.	Pacha, chayman rikchakurqa.
I don’t know everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas yachanichu.
I’m not good enough for anything.	Manam imapaqpas allinchu kani.
Not a real person.	Mana chiqap runachu.
I thought, sure this guy was there	Yuyarqanim, seguro kay runaqa chaypi kasqanmanta
There was a lot of it.	Chaypin askha karqan.
I just couldn’t find it.	Chaylla mana tariyta atirqanichu.
I still couldn't believe it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atirqanichu
I don’t want to be there.	Manam chaypiqa munanichu.
This same hour.	Kay kikin hora.
And then there’s it.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa.
But there is no point in doing so.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​chayta ruwayqa.
I didn’t know where to go.	Manam yacharqanichu maypi rinaypaq.
There or not.	Chaypi utaq mana.
Maybe both are true.	Ichapas iskayninku chiqap kanman.
I had no idea this was bad	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kay mana allin kasqanmanta
I felt good that he was real	Allinmi tarikurqani pay chiqap kasqanmanta
I know what you are like.	Ñoqaqa yachanim imayna kasqaykita.
I still can’t seem to get over it	Kunankamapas manapaschá chayta atipayta atiymanchu hina
And it should do so.	Hinaspa chaynatam ruwanan.
I couldn't tell anyone about this	Kaymantaqa manam pimanpas willayta atirqanichu
It happened one night.	Huk tutam pasarqa.
I have been this person for the past ten years.	Kay chunka watañam kay runa kani.
There is really no reason for this.	Chiqaptaqa manam imaraykupas kayqa kanchu.
But, you’re in luck.	Ichaqa, suerteyoqmi kanki.
This has happened many times.	Achka kutitam kayqa pasarqa.
That made sense	Chayqa yuyayniyuqmi karqa
I mean, really great stuff	Niyta munani, chiqap hatun imakuna
They are the bad guys.	Paykunaqa mana allin runakunam.
I have many, many ideas now	Kunanqa achka, achka yuyayniyuqmi kani
It just means you have to do it right.	Chaylla niyta munan allinta ruwanayki tiyan.
I had no idea where to go from here	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kaymanta mayman rinaypaq
But I didn’t expect an answer	Ichaqa manan kutichiyta suyarqanichu
I wish I could stop playing this game now	Munaymanmi kunan kay pukllayta saqiyta
I think everything is fine	Tukuy imapas allin kasqanmantam piensani
He did well there.	Chaypiqa allintam ruwarqa.
Okay, but it needs to be bigger.	Allinmi, ichaqa aswan hatunmi kanan.
But he didn’t do it right away.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu ruwarqan.
But, maybe not.	Ichaqa, ichapas mana.
I've never been here, this bad	Manam haykapipas kaypichu karqani, kay millay
Wasn't there no one there.	Manachu chaypiqa mana pipas karqachu.
He did very well here.	Kaypiqa anchatam allinta ruwarqa.
And do that again.	Hinaspa chayta yapamanta ruway.
It was a stupid thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa sonso ruwaymi karqan.
I'm very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kani.
But I didn’t want to talk to him	Ichaqa manan paywan rimayta munarqanichu
You can't do it now.	Kunanqa manam atiwaqchu.
In fact, the process should be very simple.	Aswanpas chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi kanan.
I’m glad this happened.	Kusikuni kay pasasqanmanta.
He didn’t want it to be easy.	Payqa manan facilchu kananta munarqan.
I didn’t know he could sing so well	Manam yacharqanichu chayna allinta takiyta atisqanmanta
Okay, do this.	Allinmi, kayta ruway.
He continued to learn.	Payqa hinallam yacharqa.
I can't seem to get it right.	Mana allintachu hap'iyta atiyman hina.
It would have made everything better.	Chayqa tukuy imatam aswan allinta ruwanman karqa.
Again, that’s a good thing.	Yapamanta, chayqa allinmi.
But things could soon be in the past.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan ñawpaq tiempopi imapas kanman.
I didn’t really want him here	Manam anchatachu kaypi paytaqa munarqani
I really have no idea why.	Chiqamanta mana ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku.
I think that is very important.	Chayqa ancha importante kasqanmantam piensani.
I feel good again this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi yapamanta allinta sientekuni.
I know it was for me	Yachanim ñuqapaq kasqanmanta
I knew exactly what to say and when to say it	Allintam yacharqani ima niyta, haykapi niyta
Now you want to do it there again.	Kunanqa hukmanta chaypi ruwayta munanki.
I said that a few months ago	Chaytaqa iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi nirqani
I’m the only one there.	Chaypiqa ñuqallam kachkani.
I don’t have it.	Manam ñuqaqa kanchu.
I knew this was not true	Yacharqanim kayqa mana chiqap kasqanmanta
We are a good many people.	Allin achka runakunam kanchik.
I am sure it will be good	Seguro kani allin kananmanta
And now here you are.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi kanki.
I never thought I would do that	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaypaqqa piensarqanichu
There’s nothing like that.	Chaytaqa manan imapas kanchu.
He seemed surprised.	Payqa admirasqa hinan kasqa.
Pretty big, so that was it.	Allin hatunmi, chaymi chay karqa.
This is too fast.	Kayqa ancha utqayllam.
That will be very important later on.	Chayqa qhepamanmi ancha importante kanqa.
I thought that was sad	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi piensarqani
I was a good girl.	Allin sipasmi karqani.
Perhaps we are.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanchik.
I wasn’t sure it was safe to talk to him	Manam segurochu karqani paywan rimanaypaq allin kasqanmantaqa
I didn’t know where to go first	Manam yacharqanichu mayman puntata rinaypaq
I feel very very happy right now	Ancha ancha kusisqam tarikuni kunanpacha
That may be the case for you.	Chayna kanman qampaq.
He can't stand it.	Payqa manam aguantayta atinchu.
So the first one is.	Chaymi ñawpaq kaq.
I can hear him well	Paytaqa allintam uyarini
I thought it would be as hard as it could be	Chayqa atisqanman hina sasa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I never really wanted it	Manam haykapipas anchatachu munarqani
But they were very, very good at it.	Ichaqa ancha, ancha allinmi chaypi karqanku.
Not much he can do about it.	Mana anchatachu chaymanta ruwayta atin.
I know you do this	Yachanim kayna ruwasqaykita
I didn't see that ever happening	Manam rikurqanichu chay haykapipas pasananta
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.	Manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu.
I don’t like it at all	Manam ni imapipas gustanchu
I'm not sure anyone really knows.	Manam segurochu kani pipas chiqaptapuni yachasqanmanta.
We are sick.	Unqusqa kanchik.
I’m boy crazy.	Ñuqaqa wayna loco kani.
I’ve been thinking about that for a while.	Chaypin huk tiempo yuyaykushani.
Those people mattered, at least.	Chay runakuna importante karqanku, aswanpas.
I never thought it wasn't very good	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu mana ancha allin kasqanmantaqa
That was a milestone.	Chayqa huk hatun ruwaymi karqan.
I haven’t heard that	Manam chaynataqa uyarirqanichu
It wasn’t supposed to be this hard, but, who knows.	Manan kay sasachu kanan karqan, ichaqa, pi yachan.
I am not sure how many.	Manam segurochu kani hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I don't understand why it doesn't	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa mana chayna kasqanmantaqa
So it was really about having a mindset	Chaymi chiqaptapuni huk yuyayniyuq kaymanta karqa
But, this is better.	Ichaqa, kayqa aswan allinmi.
I probably don’t want to	Manapaschá munanichu
No, you can’t go there.	Manan, manan chaymanqa riyta atiwaqchu.
I’ve barely heard that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá uyarirqani.
We have those things,’ he says.	Chaykunataqa kanmi’, nispas nin.
Why was that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna karqa?.
They were something.	Paykunaqa imapas karqaku.
I want to do something that I want to get on with	Imatapas ruwayta munani, chaywanmi puriyta munani
I couldn’t speak, I didn’t want to speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu, manam rimayta munarqanichu
Very confusing.	Ancha pantasqa.
What could be better?!.	¿Imataq aswan allin kanman?!.
I don’t know what happened	Manam yachanichu ima pasasqanmanta
I want to be there for you	Chaypi kaytam munani qampaq
Someone should be at home.	Pipas wasipi kanan.
I knew it was no big deal.	Ñuqaqa yacharqanim mana hatun ruway kasqanmanta.
So far we have done well.	Kunankamaqa allintam ruwarqayku.
We talked every day.	Sapa punchawmi rimaq kayku.
Of course, he didn’t know she was there.	Arí, manan yacharqanchu chaypi kashasqanmanta.
However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu kay ruwayqa kan.
I can’t watch it anymore	Manañam qawayta atiymanchu
Today is hard for me.	Kunan punchawqa sasam ñuqapaq.
I didn’t know what it was about you	Manan yacharqanichu imachus qanmanta kasqaykita
But maybe he did.	Ichaqa ichapas chaykunataqa ruwarqa.
I’ve wanted to be here for a long time, she said	Unayñan kayta munarqani, nispas nin
I’m a great guy.	Hatun runam kani.
I know exactly what is wrong	Allintam yachani ima mana allin kasqanmanta
I always had something to share	Sapa kutim imapas willanaypaq karqa
No reason for that to happen.	Mana imaraykupas chayna kananpaq.
There was no one like him.	Pay hinaqa manam pipas karqachu.
I can’t wait much longer	Manam aswan unayta suyayta atiymanchu
He was sick and injured.	Payqa unqusqa, k’irisqa ima kasqa.
I thought it would be me	Yuyarqanim ñuqa kasaq nispa
He really likes it, actually.	Paytaqa anchatam gustan, chiqaptaqa.
That says everything about him.	Chayqa paymanta tukuy imatam nin.
There were supposed to be three.	Kimsa kanan karqa.
I won’t do anything at all	Manam imatapas ruwasaqchu ni imapipas
I am truly a human being	Chiqaptam huk runa kani
Would that really be so difficult?.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayqa ancha sasa kanman?.
This guy is going.	Kay runaqa rin.
Something like that, it was very difficult.	Imapas chayna, ancha sasa karqa.
It wasn’t well hidden.	Manam allintachu pakasqa karqa.
I want to go with you though .	Ñoqaqa munani qanwan riyta ichaqa .
I'll be there this afternoon	Kunan tarde chaypi kasaq
I will be doing this very soon	Ancha utqayllam kayta ruwasaq
I was a great guy.	Hatunmi karqani.
She was the smart girl.	Payqa chay yachaysapa sipasmi kasqa.
I couldn't get them	Manam chaykunataqa hapiyta atirqanichu
I thought it would happen at some point, though	Yuyarqanim huk kutipi chayna kananta, ichaqa
To succeed, you have to succeed.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqqa mana allintam ruwanayki.
I hope he does one day	Suyachkani huk punchaw ruwananta
But that would be stupid.	Ichaqa chayqa sonso kaymi kanman.
He couldn't think.	Mana yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
He was better than this, better than that.	Payqa kaymanta aswan allin, chaymanta aswan allin karqan.
I can’t imagine what’s going on	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imakuna kasqanmanta
That’s kind of a big deal.	Chayqa huk laya hatun kaqmi.
I’m here,’ he says.	Ñuqaqa kaypi kani’, nispas nin.
Two days, two nights.	Iskay punchaw, iskay tuta.
That’s probably not right with me.	Chayqa ichapas ñuqawanqa mana allinchu kachkan.
I can do better	Aswan allinta ruwayta atiyman
He left her behind.	Payta saqirqa.
I still can't believe it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu
Yes, he can’t.	Arí, manan atinchu.
Performance performance performance.	Ruway ruway ruway ruway.
For the worst.	Mana allinpaq.
He certainly wasn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqan.
It wasn’t there now.	Manam kunanqa karqachu.
No, that could have been yesterday.	Manan, chayqa qayna p’unchaymi kanman karqan.
I want to get out of this town	Kay llaqtamanta lluqsiyta munani
I continued to be surprised.	Hinallam admirakurqani.
Probably not that long.	Manapaschá chay unaytachu.
Otherwise I wouldn’t be here	Mana chayqa manam kaypichu kayman
I couldn’t ask him now	Manam kunanqa tapuyta atirqanichu
Of course, the night would be better.	Arí, tutaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I hope he is not sick.	Suyachkani mana unqusqa kananpaq.
I mean, yeah .	Niyta munani, arí .
The result was obvious.	Chay ruwasqanqa sut’inmi karqan.
I didn’t expect a ride.	Mana huk puriyta suyarqanichu.
I can’t believe how easy this is	Mana creeyta atiymanchu kay imayna facil kasqanmanta
I have an opinion.	Ñuqaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I know he is set	Yachanim payqa churasqa kasqanmanta
He couldn't say anything.	Manas niyta atirqachu.
That was the biggest thing.	Chayqa aswan hatunmi karqa.
I doubt it ever will	Iskayrayani haykapipas chayna kananta
He's been here about two years.	Payqa yaqa iskay watañam kaypi kachkan.
I thought it was great	Ancha allinmi nispan yuyaykurqani
It was going to be a really great night.	Chiqap hatun tutam kanan karqa.
That was the hour.	Chayqa karqan chay hora.
He usually did that.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim chayta ruwaq.
This is the movie you want to see.	Kaymi chay peliculata qawayta munasqayki.
I know you probably have to do something	Yachanim yaqapaschá imapas ruwanayki kasqanmanta
I can remember something as simple as that	Chayna facil kaqta yuyariyta atiyman
I didn’t know that much about it	Manam chaynataqa yacharqanichu chaymantaqa
I will never do it	Manam haykapipas ruwasaqchu
I couldn’t do that	Chaytaqa manam atirqanichu
A real person would never do that.	Cheqaq runaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
I’m excited about what it can do	Kusikuni imakuna ruway atisqanmanta
This is finally the.	Kaymi tukukuypi chay.
I thought it might be something else	Yuyarqanim huk imapas kanman nispa
I’m, like, excited.	Ñuqaqa, hina, kusisqam kachkani.
Unfortunately it didn't work out too well.	Llakikuypaqmi mana ancha allintachu lluqsirqa.
I wonder why he did that	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa
I didn’t see or hear anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu nitaq uyarirqanichu
He couldn’t hear her properly.	Payqa manan allintachu uyariyta atinman karqan.
he received it a year later.	huk wata qhepamanmi chaskirqan.
He knew for sure now.	Payqa kunanqa allintam yacharqa.
Either you have to do something, or you have to do something.	Icha imatapas ruwanayki, icha imatapas ruwanayki.
I thought about it too.	Ñuqapas chaypim piensarqani.
But then again, that would be all.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, chaylla kanman.
I am nothing like you either	Ñuqapas manam imapas qam hinachu kani
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu.
That may be the case, but not immediately.	Chhayna kanman, ichaqa manan usqhayllachu.
No one likes to do that.	Chay ruwayqa manam pipas gustanchu.
I didn’t see anything else.	Manam hukta rikurqanichu.
I think this will be good	Kayqa allinmi kanqa nispan yuyaykuni
I wish he would do it more often	Munaymanmi aswan sapa kuti ruwananta
I know that would be wonderful for you	Yachanim chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman qampaq
I won't do it again	Manañam hukmanta ruwasaqchu
I probably don’t like it	Manapaschá gustawanchu
Yes, that would be better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I can’t do anything else like that	Manam hukta chaynataqa ruwayta atiymanchu
I didn’t know what to do with him	Manam yacharqanichu paywan ima ruwanayta
After all, it’s.	Tukuy imamanta.
It really doesn't do anything.	Chiqaptaqa manam imatapas ruwanchu.
I sure hope so.	Seguro suyachkani chayta.
I want to be that person too	Ñuqapas chay runa kaytam munani
That might work for you.	Chayqa yaqapaschá qanpaq allin kanman.
I never thought anything of it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa imatapas piensarqanichu
I feel happy again.	Hukmanta kusisqa tarikuni.

Some people may be mean.	Yaqapaschá wakin runakunaqa millay kanku.
Really, I am very sorry.	Chiqaptam, anchata llakikuni.

That’s the simple truth.	Chayqa chay facil cheqaq kaqmi.
I’m really looking forward to seeing more of her	Chiqamanta suyachkani astawan paymanta rikuyta
That’s where I thought, though	Chaypin ichaqa yuyaykurqani
And he spent the night in the house.	Hinaspa chay wasipi tuta qhepakurqan.
I didn’t think it was a bad thing	Manam mana allin ruway kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
And then it’s like that.	Hinaspa chaymanta chayna.
I thought that was a good thing	Chayqa allinpaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
Two days a week.	Semanapi iskay punchaw.
But that is not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu.
It’s actually easy.	Chiqaptaqa facilmi.
I want to talk to him	Paywan rimayta munani
That was pretty funny.	Chayqa ancha asikunapaq hinam karqa.
They are truly the best.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin aswan allin kanku.
He didn't know what to make of it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chaymanta ima ruwananta.
I know you don’t	Yachanim mana ruwasqaykita
I’m obviously angry.	Sut’inmi phiñasqa kashani.
He meant well.	Payqa allintam niyta munarqa.
Please tell me what is wrong.	Ama hina kaspa, ima mana allin kasqanmanta willaway.
I can probably believe that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa creeyta atiyman.
He was a man of great intelligence.	Payqa hatun yuyayniyuq runam karqa.
I think that was his name.	Chayqa sutinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
I didn’t want to go to this school	Manam kay yachay wasiman riyta munarqanichu
I am so proud of him	Anchatam orgulloso kani paymanta
And he looked at it.	Hinaspa chayta qhawarisqa.
I could have done worse	Aswan mana allintam ruwayman karqa
He can do well.	Payqa allintam ruwanman.
I knew what that one thing was going to be	Yacharqanim chay huk imapas ima kananta
Now they are everywhere.	Kunanqa maypipas kachkanku.
I have two thoughts about that	Chaymantaqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi kani
I had never heard of such a thing happening.	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu chayna pasasqanmantaqa.
I would love to see him again	Anchatan munani hukmanta payta rikuyta
So he has to do it.	Chaymi payqa ruwanan.
I just thought it was so funny	Chayllam ancha asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta piensarqani
I said no, I didn't.	Manam nispaymi nirqani.
I really didn’t want to believe it	Cheqaqtapunin mana creeyta munarqanichu
I didn’t want to take that chance	Manam chay oportunidadta hapiyta munarqanichu
I still wasn't happy about it.	Kunankamapas manam kusisqachu karqani chaymantaqa.
I am very happily married.	Ancha kusisqam casarasqa kachkani.
I tried to think about it but couldn't	Chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqani ichaqa manam atirqanichu
I used to come here all the time	Sapa kutim kayman hamuq kani
I was never sure.	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani.
I saw it twice.	Iskay kutitam rikurqani.
Now I don't know what to say.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu ima niyta.
There is nothing good about it.	Manam imapas allinqa kanchu.
I know how to get there	Chayman chayayta yachani
I take them seriously	Chaykunataqa allintam hapini
I want you to be happy, always	Munani kusisqa kanaykita, sapa kuti
Now I can anywhere anywhere.	Kunanqa maypipas maypipas maypipas atiyman.
I thought you couldn't be from here.	Yuyarqanim mana kaymanta kayta atisqaykita.
That would have been easy.	Chayqa facilmi kanman karqa.

I don’t know if anyone got hurt	Manam yachanichu pipas k’irisqa kasqanmantaqa

Young! 	Wayna!
All this stuff is pretty cool.	Tukuy kay imapas ancha sumaqmi.

I wasn’t sure it was the right thing to do	Manam segurochu karqani allin ruway kasqanmanta
But it would never have happened.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kanman karqan.
I wasn’t sure he ever was	Manam segurochu karqani haykapipas kasqanmantaqa
So very much indeed.	Chaymi anchata chiqaptapuni.
Nothing would be right.	Manan imapas allinchu kanman.
The first day is the hardest.	Ñawpaq p’unchaymi aswan sasa.
I have no idea what this could be.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imataq kay kanman.
I didn’t see this coming.	Manam rikurqanichu kay hamunanta.
He didn’t say anything.	Payqa manan imatataq nirqanchu.
But I didn’t know what to do about it	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu chaymanta imatachus ruwanayta
That’s what’s with him.	Chayqa paywan kaqmi.
That doesn’t sound like much.	Chayqa manan ancha hinachu uyarikun.
He wanted him arrested.	Payqa munarqanmi hap’isqa kananta.
I'm sure he knew something wasn't quite right.	Seguro kani yachasqanmanta imapas mana allintachu kasqanmanta.
He loves it so much.	Payqa anchatam munan.
I did something new and strange.	Musuq, mana riqsisqa imatapas ruwarqani.

I couldn’t see it.	Manam qawayta atirqanichu.
I didn’t really want to eat	Manam anchatachu mikhuyta munarqani
He had no choice really.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu cheqaqtapuni.
I didn’t really know what he meant	Manam allintachu yacharqani ima niyta munasqanmanta
He must go with you.	Payqa qanwan kuskan rinan.

I didn’t know there was such a thing	Manam yacharqanichu chayna imapas kasqanmantaqa
To make things better.	Imapas allin kananpaq.

Or he was too young.	Utaq ancha wayna kasqa.
I thought he was crazy.	Loco kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
I was sure we did	Seguro karqani chayta ruwasqaykumanta
I didn’t want to do that	Manam chaynata ruwaytaqa munarqanichu
So go for it, and that’s it.	Chaymi riy, hinaspa chaylla.
I went to talk to you, but you weren’t there	Qanwan rimaq rirqani, ichaqa manan chaypichu karqanki
Some, more.	Wakin, astawan.
I can wait so long	Chayna unayta suyayta atiyman
That would speed up the process.	Chayqa usqhayllan chay ruwayta ruwanman.
One go, one go.	Huk riy, huk riy.
That’s not like you.	Chayqa manan qan hinachu.
I didn’t want to talk about it, but it seemed funny	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu, ichaqa asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa
He didn’t need this.	Payqa manan kayta necesitarqanchu.
I didn’t really know how much time went by	Manam allintachu yacharqani tiempo pasasqanmanta
I was a little busy there for a while	Chaypin huk rato huk chhikanta ocupasqa karqani
I was so proud of what I did	Anchatan orgulloso karqani chay ruwasqaymanta
He was a little nervous.	Payqa huk chhikantan mancharisqa kasharqan.
I couldn't stand schoolwork anymore	Manañam escuelapi llamkayta aguantayta atirqanichu
This is the chance.	Kaymi chansa.
He gladly accepted it.	Payqa kusisqan chaskirqan.
I hope this is easy	Suyachkani kayqa mana sasachu kananta
That was a wonderful thing to do.	Chayqa huk sumaq ruwaymi karqan.
I know how many there are.	Yachanim hayka kasqanmanta.
I doubt anyone wants to tackle it	Iskayrayani pipas chayta atipayta munasqanmanta
Half of it is good.	Kuskan allinmi.
But now he knew better.	Ichaqa kunanmi aswan allinta yacharqan.
He was the third.	Payqa kimsa kaqmi karqa.
Very, very true.	Ancha, ancha chiqap.
It was a really, really hard time for me.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sasa pacha karqa ñuqapaq.
But he did what he said he would do.	Ichaqa nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
Now I have to do something	Kunanmi ima ruwanay kachkan
I don’t want it any other way	Manam huk hinachu munani
You are not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanki.
I can’t wait for it	Manam suyayta atiymanchu
They are new every morning.	Sapa paqarinmi musuq kanku.
But I didn’t think about it	Ichaqa manan chaypiqa yuyaykurqanichu
A strong never the less	Huk sinchi mana hayk’aqpas pisi
There is nothing wrong with that.	Chaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu.
I cannot say at this point	Kaypiqa manam niyta atiymanchu
But now I have a problem.	Ichaqa kunanmi huk sasachakuypi tarikuni.
I really wanted to see it again	Anchatam munarqani hukmanta qawayta
I can't believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu.
That was a big deal	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi karqa
However, in the world.	Ichaqa, kay pachapi.
If nothing else happens.	Mana imapas chayna kaptinqa.
I could not bear this	Kaytaqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu
He wants to be better	Payqa aswan allin kaytam munan
I don't remember how many	Manam yuyarinichu hayka kasqanmantaqa
It can’t be the only thing.	Manan chayllachu kanman.
I wanted it to be quick	Usqhaylla kananta munarqani
I always knew that	Sapa kutim chaytaqa yacharqani
That’s not so easy .	Chayqa manan chay hina facilchu .
I wanted to do the same	Ñuqapas chaynatam munarqani
I couldn't play it.	Chaytaqa manam pukllayta atirqanichu.
He played with us all the time.	Tukuy tiempon ñoqaykuwan pukllaq.
The latter, however, is the best course of action.	Chay qhepa kaqmi ichaqa aswan allin ruwayqa.
I was probably a little uncomfortable	Yaqapaschá huk chhikanta mana allinchu karqani
Probably probably.	Yaqapaschá yaqapaschá.
So we both had a go.	Chaymi iskayninku huk riyta ruwarqayku.
It will take about two days.	Yaqa iskay punchawmi kanqa.
In fact, he was.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa karqa.
I take it every other day.	Sapa iskay punchawmi hapini.
However, it is absurd.	Ichaqa, mana yuyayniyuqmi.
And then there we are.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa chaypi kachkaniku.
And everything will just happen.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas chaylla kanqa.
I didn't have time for that	Chaypaqqa manañam tiempoy karqachu
He does it right away.	Payqa chayllam ruwan.
I just couldn’t say no.	Chaylla mana niyta atirqanichu.
It was a difficult year.	Sasa wata karqa.
This isn’t going to happen.	Kayqa manam kanqachu.
These are incomprehensible.	Chaykunataqa manam entiendeyta atichwanchu.
I wanted to know about him	Paymanta yachayta munarqani
This is what he loves to do.	Kaytam payqa anchata munan ruwayta.
I wonder where he is	Maypi kasqanmanta tapukuni
That’s not always as easy as it sounds.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu uyarikun hina facil.
He had done this many times before.	Ñawpaqtaqa askha kutitan chayta ruwarqan.
I was sure he was disappointed in me	Seguro karqani ñoqamanta hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
I mean, he’s never, ever been that way with me.	Niyta munani, payqa manan hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan ñoqawanqa.
I was as happy as I could be	Atiyman hinam kusisqa karqani
I probably should anyway	Yaqapaschá imayna kaptinpas ruwanay
I’m doing the same thing	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwachkani
But I knew it wasn’t going to happen	Ichaqa yacharqanim mana chayna kananta
I have seen it all.	Tukuy chaytam rikurqani.
I know what this is going to be like	Yachanim kay imayna kananta
I never wanted to for any reason	Manam haykapipas imaraykupas munarqanichu
I know very well what will happen	Ancha allintam yachani imakuna pasananta
I have been doing this for many years	Achka watañam chayta ruwachkani
But I think it's people	Ichaqa piensani runakuna kasqanmanta
I mean, this was it.	Niyta munani, kayqa karqan.
Two things, actually.	Iskay imakuna, chiqaptaqa.
I know it's that quick	Yachanim chay utqaylla kasqanmanta
It looks so much better now.	Kunanqa ancha aswan allinmi rikchakun.
All the first.	Tukuy ñawpaq.
I can’t think of anything else to do	Manam huk ruwaypi yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I don’t really know much about it.	Manam chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa anchatachu yachani.
Stop making it about you.	Amaña qanmanta ruwaychu.
It will be very difficult for you.	Ancha sasa kanqa qampaq.
I hope I never see more.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas astawan qawayta.
I feel like this is the right time	Kaymi allin tiempo kananpaq hinam tarikuni
I’m fine with this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kachkani.
I can’t imagine him	Manam paytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
There is nothing worse.	Manam imapas aswan mana allinqa kanchu.
I knew he wanted to see what was wrong	Yacharqanim ima mana allin kasqanmanta qawayta munasqanmanta
I just couldn’t wait.	Chaylla mana suyayta atirqanichu.
No, seriously, do this.	Manan, serio, kayta ruway.
Don't know anything about it.	Ama imatapas chaymantaqa yachankichu.
But they were serious.	Ichaqa serio karqanku.
I was angry and sad	Ñoqaqa phiñasqa, llakisqa ima karqani
Sure, everyone is.	Seguro, llapa runam chayna.
Next time, next time.	Qatiqnin kutipi, qatiqnin kutipi.
I want to be like you.	Ñoqapas qan hina kaytan munani.
People are people are people.	Runakunaqa runakunam runakuna.
I want to be like him	Pay hina kaytam munani
Yes, that is you.	Arí, chayqa qanmi kanki.
You are a human being.	Huk runam kanki.
More angry than ever.	Aswan phiñasqa.
It doesn’t matter where.	Manam imananpaschu maypi.
You obviously don’t know anything about it.	Sut’inmi chaymantaqa mana imatapas yachankichu.
You’re the one.	Qamqa paymi kanki.
I know this is hard for you right now	Yachanim kunanpacha kayqa sasa qampaq kasqanmanta
That shouldn’t be that difficult.	Chayqa manan chay hina sasachu kanan.
I can’t be sick	Manam unqusqa kayta atiymanchu
I couldn't wait to see him	Manam suyayta atirqanichu payta qawayta
If anything, you were useless.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, mana imapaqpas hinan karqanki.
No he wouldn’t do that.	Manan payqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
I still want all the best.	Hinallam munani tukuy ima allin kaqta.
It’s just always there.	Chaylla sapa kuti chaypi kachkan.
I don't see anything it looks like at all	Manam imatapas rikunichu ni imapipas rikchakun
I can’t wait to tell you about it	Manam suyayta atiymanchu chaymanta willanaypaq
I didn’t know either	Ñoqapas manan yacharqanichu
Not sure what could have gone wrong.	Mana segurochu imachus mana allin kanman karqan chayta.
I feel like he’s really happy	Chiqap kusisqa kasqanmantam sientekuni
Now he wants more and more and more.	Kunanqa astawan astawan astawan munan.
What just happened.	Imataq chayllaraq pasarqa.
It was too, too crazy.	Llumpay, llumpay loco hinam karqa.
I can’t wait that long	Manam chay unayta suyayta atiymanchu
That’s the wisdom.	Chayqa yachaysapa kaymi.
But after a while he spoke again.	Ichaqa huk rato qhepamanmi hukmanta rimarqan.
You look busy.	Ocupasqa hinam rikchakunki.
I knew exactly what he was going to do tonight	Allintam yacharqani kunan tuta ima ruwananta
But that was a long time ago	Ichaqa chayqa unayñan karqan
I didn’t see him here tonight	Manam kunan tutaqa kaypi rikurqanichu
I certainly knew where they were	Cheqaqtapunin yacharqani maypi kasqankuta
I need to be more secure	Aswan seguro kanay tiyan
I can't stand it anymore	Manañam chaytaqa aguantayta atinichu
I wonder if he’s happy.	Kusisqa kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I couldn’t let him do that	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu chayta ruwananpaq
I didn’t want to tell you anything	Manam imatapas willayta munarqanichu
I certainly would do that	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwayman
That seemed absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
But that was the most important thing.	Ichaqa chay ruwaymi aswan importante karqan.
I doubt he went there	Iskayrayani chayman risqanmanta
He certainly said that	Cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan
I was a little surprised but happy	Huk chhikantan admirakurqani ichaqa kusisqan karqani
Things were still wrong.	Hinallam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I still saw him	Paytaqa hinallam rikurqani
It was with that.	Chaywanmi karqa.
I hope they are right	Suyachkani allin kasqankuta
I saw him last night.	Qayna tutam payta rikurqani.
I probably never will	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas ruwasaqchu
I couldn't understand what he wanted from me	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imatam ñuqamanta munasqanmanta
I am the person on the outside	Ñuqam kani hawapi kaq runa
I really didn’t notice	Chiqaptaqa manam repararqanichu
He was in the hospital for a week.	Payqa huk semanan hospitalpi kasharqan.
I couldn't understand it	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atirqanichu
You were the last one.	Qanmi karqanki qhepa kaq.
You seem to be a beautiful person.	Sumaq runa hinam kanki.
I didn’t know what he meant.	Manam yacharqanichu imapas niyta munasqanmanta.
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runan karqan.
Everything was really good.	Tukuy imapas chiqap allinmi karqa.
I don’t want that.	Manam munanichu chaytaqa.
I was so tired last night	Qayna tutam ancha sayk’usqa karqani
I thought maybe.	Yuyarqanim ichapas.
Where there are no adults.	Maypichus mana kuraq runakuna kanchu.
That wasn’t good out there tonight.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan kunan tuta hawapi.
I thought everything was fine	Tukuy imapas allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
He really likes it, for sure	Paytaqa anchatam gustan, seguro
I pretend it's not very attractive	Mana ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq hinam ruwani
I am the person who is.	Ñuqaqa chay runam kani.
I'm sorry, he repeated.	Pampachaykuway, nispas yapamanta nisqa.
And he went away.	Hinaspa rirqa.
I really didn’t want to be	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta munarqanichu
I soon found out why	Pisi tiempollamantan yacharqani imarayku chayta
I am always me.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim ñuqa kani.
I wasn’t a bad guy, really	Manam millay runachu karqani, chiqaptaqa
I didn’t really want that	Chaytaqa manan anchatachu munarqani
You can’t catch it.	Manam hapiyta atiwaqchu.
He couldn’t stay here now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kaypi qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
I always have something to say	Sapa kutim imapas rimanaypaq kan
I couldn’t stand it anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa aguantayta atirqanichu.
This can be a more difficult task.	Kayqa aswan sasa ruwaymi kanman.
He had to make it happen.	Payqa chayta ruwananpaqmi ruwanan karqan.
I thought this was something else	Kayqa huk imapas kasqanmantam piensarqani
Where it was.	Maypichus kasqa.
But at least I did	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani
I want to know exactly what happened	Imakuna pasasqanmanta allinta yachayta munani
It really is.	Chiqaptam kachkan.
Night and day really.	Tuta punchaw chiqaptapuni.
What is it about him? 	¿Imataq paymanta?
is he everyone? 	payqa llapa runachu?
I knew they weren't for me	Yacharqanim mana ñuqapaq kasqankuta
I'll keep going	Hinallam risaq
I knew he had a lot of talent	Yacharqanim achka yachaysapa kasqanmanta
I didn’t know what he was thinking	Manam yacharqanichu ima piensasqanmanta
There is nothing I can do here.	Kaypiqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
And that would be it.	Hinaspa chaylla kanman.
A year later, another	Huk wata qhepamanmi huk
This night was the worst night ever.	Kay tutaqa aswan mana allin tutam karqa.
It would have been great.	Hatunmi kanman karqan.
That was something, at least.	Chayqa imapas karqa, aswanpas.
There was no one like him.	Manam pipas pay hinaqa karqachu.
I could not believe this.	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
Actually it was just me	Chiqaptaqa ñuqallam karqani
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manam allin ruwaychu.
I knew exactly what he was thinking	Allintam yacharqani ima piensasqanmanta
I can't say that.	Chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu.
Probably nothing, but he couldn't be sure.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas, ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
I thought there was something	Imapas kasqanmantam piensarqani
One good often two	Huk allin sapa kuti iskay
Everything is fine with me.	Tukuy imapas allinmi ñuqawanqa.
Almost last night.	Yaqa qayna tuta.
A man with many names.	Achka sutiyuq runa.
That was two years ago.	Chayqa iskay wata ñawpaqta.
I saw nothing of that	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas rikurqanichu
This is fine so far.	Kayqa kunankamaqa allinmi.
Where was he now?.	¿Maypitaq kunan karqa?.
I want to go to university	Hatun yachay wasiman riyta munani
He was a cold one.	Payqa chiri kasqa.
They are here to stay.	Paykunaqa kaypim kachkanku.
It turned out pretty well.	Allin allintam lluqsirqa.
I’ve done that before too	Ñoqapas ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqani
I had always had to do that on my own	Chaytaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi sapallay ruwanay karqa
Bigger and faster.	Aswan hatun hinaspa aswan utqaylla.
I think you can see that this is true	Yuyaykuni kay cheqaq kasqanmanta rikuyta atisqaykita
I hope you decide to do good things with it	Suyachkani chaywan allin ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq yuyaykusqaykita
I really should have done this last night	Chiqaptam kayta ruwanay karqa qayna tuta
Maybe I can do something for you.	Ichapas qampaq imatapas ruwayta atiyman.
I do two things very well	Iskay ruwaykunata ancha allinta ruwani
Tomorrow there again.	Paqarin chaypi yapamanta.
I didn’t have time for that	Chaypaqqa manam tiempoy karqachu
As before, again.	Ñawpaq hina, yapamanta.
I have never seen anything like him	Pay hinaqa manam haykapipas rikurqanichu
He did it for me.	Paymi ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
I don’t want to stop it.	Manam harkayta munanichu.
I thought it was pretty good	Allin allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I am late one day.	Huk punchawmi tarde kachkani.
He does what he doesn't want to do	Payqa mana munasqanman hinam ruwan
Like everything else.	Tukuy ima hina.
I can’t think of anything else to do	Manam huk ruwaytapas yuyaymanayta atinichu
But the process was quick.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa usqhayllan karqan.
I'm not sure he knows what it is today.	Manam segurochu kani kunan tiempopi ima kasqanmanta yachasqanmanta.
I was too stupid.	Llumpay sonso karqani.
There were a lot of people.	Achka runakunam karqaku.
The patient refused these procedures.	Chay unqusqa mana munarqanchu kay ruwaykunata.
He opened it again.	Hukmanta kicharirqa.
Do this immediately.	Chaytaqa chaylla ruway.
But he would have done that.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanman karqan.
I was so glad he was home	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani wasinpi kasqanmanta
I don't believe this.	Kaytaqa manam creenichu.
It was a really nice day.	Chiqap sumaq punchawmi karqa.
Both are foolish.	Iskayninkum mana yuyayniyuq kanku.
I was sure he was going to be disappointed	Seguro karqani hukmanyasqa kananta
Not not not not.	Mana mana mana mana.
I can’t do that for you.	Manan chaytaqa qanpaq ruwaymanchu.
I want to do more of that.	Chaymanta astawan ruwayta munani.
I didn’t know what he wanted from me	Manam yacharqanichu imata ñuqamanta munasqanmanta
It’s rather unfortunate.	Aswan llakikuypaqmi.
I thought it would be bad, but it wasn’t	Yuyarqanin mana allinchu kananta, ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan
He can’t handle it anymore.	Manaña chayta atipayta atinchu.
The same moment.	Chay kikin rato.
I was pretty sure of that	Yaqapaschá chaymanta seguro karqani
They are not, however.	Paykunaqa manan ichaqa.
But that wouldn't matter.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu kanman.
That’s what I said.	Chaytan nirqani.
I didn't notice until now	Kunankamaqa manam repararqanichu
So it’s great.	Chaymi hatun.
But it's always really good.	Ichaqa sapa kutim chiqaptapuni allin.
I hope it will be soon	Suyachkani chaylla kananta
I just can't bear to think about it, really.	Chaylla mana aguantayta atinichu chaypi yuyaymanayta, chiqaptaqa.
But now he was happy about it.	Kunanmi ichaqa chaymanta kusisqa kasharqan.
It would be a good meal tomorrow.	Paqarin allin mikhuy kanman.
Good guy, that guy.	Allin runa, chay runa.
I didn't think he knew that	Manam piensarqanichu chayta yachananta
He probably didn't do that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I know you can do well	Yachanim allinta ruwayta atisqaykita
I was really tired pretty early though.	Chiqaptam sayk’usqa karqani ancha temprano ichaqa.
It will be past or present.	Ñawpaq utaq kunan kanqa.
They were now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi karqanku.
I really want to.	anchatam munani.
You can do it right.	Allintam ruwawaq.
I don’t care what happens at this end	Manam imananpaschu kay tukukuypi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa
But I’ll never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
I didn’t know how to do it	Manam imayna ruwaytapas yacharqanichu
No one knows everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas yachanchu.
If it doesn’t work for you, let me know.	Mana qampaq allin kaptinqa willaway.
I can’t really make sense of anything	Manam chiqaptachu imamantapas allinta entiendeyta atiyman
I never knew it would happen so fast	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna utqaylla pasananta
I was, after all, a good boy	Ñuqaqa karqani, tukuy imamanta, allin wayna
I can’t get to it.	Manam chaymanqa chayayta atinichu.
Another fact this time.	Huk chiqap kay kutipi.
Now he wasn't sure.	Kunanqa manañam segurochu kasqa.
I didn’t realize it was	Manam repararqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
You are a wise man.	Qamqa yachaysapa runam kanki.
Hopefully things will work out one way or another.	Munaymanmi imapas huk utaq huk hina allin kananta.
I have no idea what happened to him.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta.
I just don’t know what it’s like yet.	Chayllaraqmi manaraq yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
I’m going at the end of next month	Hamuq killa tukukuypi risaq
You never knew what he was going to do.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu ima ruwananta.
Okay, now do it again.	Allinmi, kunanqa yapamanta ruway.
But it should be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanan.
No you can’t do it.	Manan manan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But he said nothing to help her.	Ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu yanapananpaq.
Regardless of the type of food.	Imayna mikhuy kaptinpas.
Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas ancha hatunmi karqa.
And so no, we’re fine.	Hinaspa chaymi mana, allinmi kayku.
So it shouldn't be that difficult.	Chaymi mana chayna sasachu kanan.
I wanted to be someone	Pipas kaytam munarqani
I couldn’t tell you that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa willayta atirqanichu
I have a couple of ideas as to what might happen	Ñuqaqa huk iskay yuyayniyuqmi kani imachus kanman chaymanta
I know you can do it	Yachanim ruwayta atisqaykita
This is a good boy.	Kayqa allin wayna.
That’s what that means.	Chayqa chay niyta munan.
Then, it was outside.	Chaymanta, hawapi kasqa.
It was pretty good.	Allin allinmi karqa.
There is nothing anywhere.	Manan imapas maypipas kanchu.
I felt like I was there	Chaypi hinam tarikurqani
They live there.	Chaypim yachanku.
I certainly played a part in it	Cheqaqtapunin chaypi huk ruwayta ruwarqani
I’m good at that.	Chaypiqa allinmi kani.
I need to do this quickly	Kayta utqaylla ruwanay tiyan
It was really, really good.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin karqa.
I was no longer the same person	Manañam kikin runachu karqani
Knowledge of nothing.	Mana imamantapas yachay.
I didn’t hear about anything	Manam imamantapas uyarirqanichu
I can't answer now	Kunanqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu
That was it, actually.	Chayqa karqa, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe he is.	Ichapas payqa kachkan.
And he’s like that.	Hinaspa payqa chayna.
In fact, it was better that way.	Aswanpas chay hinaqa aswan allinmi karqan.
He wasn’t sure what.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa imamanta.
Is that a good thing.	¿Allinchu chay.
Most of the time it worked for me.	Yaqa llapanpim ñuqapaq allin karqa.
Tell me about it.	Chayta willay.
I was very happy that day.	Chay punchawqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqani.
He wasn’t quite himself.	Payqa manan allintachu pay kikin karqan.
I can't get away with it anymore	Manañam chaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu
I was really busy too	Chiqaptam ñuqapas ocupasqa karqani
I was sure he was there.	Seguro karqani chaypi kasqanmanta.
I really want to go.	Anchatam riyta munani.
Plenty of other things, sure, but not this.	Askha huk imakuna, seguro, ichaqa manan kaychu.
But do it quickly.	Ichaqa usqhaylla ruway.
And that’s, you know, the best part.	Hinaspa chayqa, yachanki, aswan allin kaqmi.
I know he won't be here tonight	Yachanim kunan tuta mana kaypi kananta
If you do, please let me know.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, ama hina kaspa willaway.
I knew exactly where it would be	Allintam yacharqani maypi kananta
He had been there for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kasharqan.
I know exactly what happened here	Kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta allinta yachani
I can’t sing at all	Manam ni imapipas takiyta atinichu
I want you to be mine again	Munani hukmanta ñuqapa kanaykita
It was rather ridiculous.	Aswanpas asikunapaq hinan karqan.
This sounds like a sensible approach.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuq ruway hinam uyarikun.
It would be better to do so now	Aswan allinmi kanman kunan chayta ruwayqa
I want to talk to you	Qanwan rimayta munani
One could be wrong.	Hukninmi pantasqa kanman.
Things are going well.	Imapas allintam rin.
I don’t want to think about it anymore	Manañam chaypi yuyaymanayta munanichu
One person wants to.	Huk runaqa munan.
Maybe it’s you.	Ichapas qam kanki.
No one has agreed to do that, yet.	Manam pipas chayta ruwananpaqqa acuerdopichu kachkan, kunankamapas.
I’m sure it won’t do well	Seguro kani mana allintachu ruwananta
He felt comfortable.	Payqa allintam tarikurqa.
We didn't talk much now.	Kunanqa manam anchatachu rimaq kayku.
They seemed perfectly happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska allin kusisqa hinam karqaku.
He wasn’t sure of anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas segurochu kasqa.
I hope to be there tomorrow	Paqarin chaypi kayta suyachkani
You are going to have to do something about it.	Chaypaqqa imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi kachkanki.
I can't get that anywhere.	Chaytaqa manam maypipas chayayta atiymanchu.
I have never seen anything like this in the world.	Manam haykapipas kay pachapi hinaqa rikurqanichu.
I know they are out there	Yachanim hawapi kasqankuta
I know you won't do anything about it	Yachanim chaymanta mana imatapas ruwanaykita
I didn’t say that exactly	Manam chaytaqa allintachu nirqani
I know it doesn't really matter	Yachanim mana chiqaptachu imapas kasqanmanta
No telling what he can do, where he will go.	Mana willay ima ruwayta atisqanmanta, mayman rinqa.
This is a good and bad thing.	Kayqa allin mana allin kaqmi.
He was the first one.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq karqa.
I didn’t know how to ask	Manam yacharqanichu imayna tapuyta
Yes, it is very difficult.	Arí, ancha sasam.
But it may or may not be enough.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá manapaschá allinchu.
I just know you’re wrong	Chaylla yachani pantasqa kasqaykita
He knew that he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaytaqa.
I knew why he was here	Yacharqanim imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta
Happy, actually.	Kusisqa, chiqaptaqa.
Do it for yourself.	Qanpaq ruway.
I was just surprised.	Chayllaraqmi admirakurqani.
How’s it going there.	Imaynataq chaypi.
I want him to be his own person.	Pay kikin runa kananta munani.
You're a quick person, or aren't you.	Qamqa utqaylla runam kanki, icha manachu.
This was the last step.	Kaymi karqan qhepa kaq ruway.
I couldn’t sit still	Manañam tiyayta atirqanichu
I don't know where the problem is, everything seems fine.	Manam yachanichu maypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta, tukuy imapas allin hinam kachkan.
I know all of that well	Tukuy chaytaqa allintam yachani
If so, it happened really fast.	Chayna kaptinqa, chiqap utqayllam pasarqa.
The second day of the month.	Iskay kaq p’unchaw.
I’m not there for you.	Manam chaypichu kachkani.
He said he felt safe there.	Paymi nirqa chaypi seguro sientekusqanmanta.
Three times crazy, yes.	Kimsa kuti loco, arí.
I really think so.	Chiqaptam chaynata piensani.
I knew what he had to say.	Yacharqanim ima rimananpaq kasqanmanta.
I’m sure it will help	Seguro kani yanapananta
Why or not.	Imarayku icha mana.
I wasn’t sure he was hurt.	Manam segurochu karqani k’irisqa kasqanmantaqa.
He looked pathetic.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
One person at a time.	Huk runa huk kutipi.
I, you know, didn’t quite know how to come	Ñuqaqa, yachanki, mana allintachu yacharqani imayna hamuyta
This turned out well.	Kayqa allintam lluqsirqa.
I want to see him every day	Sapa punchawmi payta qawayta munani
I know it can be hard	Yachanim sasa kanman chayta
Is this the case.	¿Kaychu.
Never, really.	Mana hayk’aqpas, chiqaptaqa.
I just agreed with him	Chayllaraqmi paywan acuerdopi karqani
This result was found.	Kay ruwaymi tarikurqa.
I mean, you know, they were both.	Niyta munani, yachanki, iskayninku karqanku.
I know what he wants	Yachanim ima munasqanmanta
I am a man like you	Ñoqapas qan hina runan kani
And you want to stay, you want to.	Hinaspa qhepakuyta munanki, munanki.
I want to go there.	Chayman riyta munani.
He is truly gone.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin manaña kanchu.
I can’t believe how wonderful this is	Mana creeyta atiymanchu kay imayna sumaq kasqanmanta
People seemed very smart.	Runakunaqa ancha yachaysapa hinam karqaku.
I had no idea what time it was	Manam piensarqanichu ima tiempo kasqanmantaqa
This will be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanqa.
Most of the time it works.	Yaqa llapanpim allinta ruwan.
I am doing that right now	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwachkani
Perhaps, too much.	Ichapas, llumpay.
He's here, man.	Payqa kaypim kachkan, runa.
Very very nice.	Ancha ancha sumaq.
I don’t want to give up	Manam saqiyta munanichu
I was still, so everything was fine	Ñuqaqa hinallam karqani, chaymi tukuy imapas allin karqa
Maybe you have a different idea.	Ichapas huk chikan yuyayniyuq kanki.
Don't forget this.	Ama kayta qunqaychu.
I just didn’t realize how sick I was	Chaylla mana repararqanichu imayna unqusqa kasqayta
Very good weather.	Ancha allin pacha.
It was that big of a deal.	Chayna hatunmi karqa.
I wasn’t always successful	Manam sapa kutichu allinta ruwaq kani
He looked tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa hinan karqan.
I can’t go now	Manam kunanqa riyta atiymanchu
And yes, I mean it too.	Hinaspa arí, ñuqapas niyta munan.
I wasn’t sure how badly he was hurt last night	Manam segurochu karqani qayna tuta imayna sinchita k’irisqa kasqanmanta
I do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwani.
I mean, somebody had to do it	Niyta munani, pipas ruwanan karqan
I can’t think about nothing now	Manam kunanqa mana imapipas yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I agree that he is a good man	Ñuqaqa allin runa kasqanmantam acuerdopi kani
I’m not sure what happened there, but whatever.	Manam segurochu kani chaypi ima pasasqanmanta, ichaqa imapas.
I didn't know what to say anyway	Imayna kaptinpas manam ima niyta yacharqanichu
Anyway, it shouldn't be here.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam kaypichu kanan.
Everyone knows that by now.	Kunankamaqa llapallankum chaytaqa yachanku.
I didn’t really know about it	Manam chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
I am confused about everything	Tukuy imamanta pantasqa kachkani
He's a great guy doing a great job.	Payqa hatun runam hatun llamkayta ruwaspa.
I’m for him.	Ñuqa paypaq.
I never wanted to be with him.	Manam haykapipas paywan kaytaqa munarqanichu.
The worst time ever.	Aswan mana allin pacha.
Like tonight’s.	Kunan tuta kaq hina.
But it was a very sad day.	Ichaqa chay punchawqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I’ll be there all weekend	Tukuy semana tukuyta chaypi kasaq
He said he was the worst person ever.	Payqa aswan mana allin runa kasqanmantam nisqa.
You never want to say, you know, this is it.	Manan hayk’aqpas niyta munankichu, yachanki, kaymi nispa.
I was a new person in the world	Ñoqaqa kay pachapi mosoq runan karqani
I went there for about an hour one day	Huk punchawmi huk hora hina chayman rirqani
Nothing more than that, really.	Mana imapas aswan chaymanta, chiqaptapuni.

But it was about that.	Ichaqa chaymantam karqa.
I didn't think that was the case at all	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu ni imapipas
I hope to get there one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw chayman chayayta.
You are now an adult.	Kunanqa kuraq runam kanki.
Learn what he did.	Ima ruwasqanmanta yachay.
I can’t stand it	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu
In fact, he never did.	Aswanpas manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I want to be a better person.	Aswan allin runa kaytam munani.
It really seems like anything.	Chiqaptapuni imapas kaptinpas rikchakun.
I think nothing will happen tonight, but very soon	Kunan tuta mana imapas pasananta yuyani, ichaqa ancha utqaylla
He thought this was ridiculous.	Payqa kayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I really wanted him to	Cheqaqtapunin munarqani chayta ruwananta
There is nothing better.	Manam imapas aswan allinqa.
You’re the one who’s me.	Qamqa ñuqam kanki.
I don’t want to believe it	Manam creeyta munanichu
I couldn’t figure out why	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I'm going to go there today	Kunanmi chayman risaq
It was sure about it.	Seguro karqan chaymanta.
I never heard why	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I always knew when it was you	Sapa kutim yacharqani haykapi qam kasqaykita
Maybe it doesn't and that's why it still exists.	Ichapas mana chayta ruwanchu chaymi kunankamapas kachkan.
I didn't know this, well	Kaytaqa manam yacharqanichu, allinta
I just don’t quite know.	Chaylla mana allintachu yachani.
I knew it was a problem	Yacharqanim sasachakuy kasqanmanta
But he realized she wanted to come.	Ichaqa repararqanmi hamuyta munasqanmanta.
I'm not sure that's the case	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa
That wasn’t difficult at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas sasachu karqan.
I can’t think of anything else	Manam hukta yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
I really meant it too	Ñuqapas chiqaptam chaytaqa niyta munarqani
Today was a very good day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha allin punchawmi karqa.
And here they are.	Hinaspa kaypi kachkanku.
To do that, in the right way.	Chayta ruwanapaq, allin ruwaypi.
I doubt we’ll do that	Iskayrayani chayta ruwanaykupaq
Great truth.	Hatun chiqap.
But then it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan imananpaschu.
I couldn't look at them anymore	Chaykunataqa manañam qawayta atirqanichu
He cannot speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atinchu.
I hadn’t thought about it yet	Manaraqmi chaypiqa yuyaykurqanichu
I mean, this could be for the best	Niyta munani, kayqa allinpaq kanman
You're actually not very good at it.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha allinchu chaypiqa kanki.
I was truly alone now	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa sapallay karqani
Now I know it was a one-off, not an if.	Kunanqa yachanim huk kutilla kasqanmanta, manam sichus.
I really wanted to be like that	Anchatam chayna kayta munarqani
He knows it isn’t.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I’m not there for you	Manam chaypichu kachkani
I'm still here.	Hinallam kaypi kachkani.
Good guy, good guy	Allin runa, allin runa
He had to do that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanan karqa.
But you know better.	Ichaqa qanmi aswan allinta yachanki.
Maybe he really felt bad about what happened.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni mana allintachu tarikurqa chay pasasqanmanta.
I want to talk more about this	Kaymanta astawan rimayta munani
There is no such thing as an individual.	Sapa runa hinaqa manan kanchu.
For everything he’s done.	Tukuy ima ruwasqanmanta.
I'll do that tonight	Chaytaqa kunan tutam ruwasaq
They are very good.	Ancha allinmi kanku.
I will certainly do so.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwasaq.
I saw the story about it	Chaymanta willakuyta rikurqani
I was really excited	Cheqaqtapunin kusisqa karqani
I wasn’t sure you were right	Manam segurochu karqani chiqap kasqaykita
I had to be ready too	Ñoqapas listo kanay karqan
I thought now would be a good time	Yuyarqanim kunanqa allin tiempo kanman nispa
They were very happy for a while.	Paykunaqa huk tiempon ancha kusisqa karqanku.
It looks really bad.	Chiqaptam mana allin rikchakun.
I feel good about this	Kaymantaqa allintam sientekuni
I never thought this would ever come from him.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayqa haykapipas paymanta hamunanta.
There are important people.	Kanmi importante runakuna.
I had to act quickly	Chaypaqqa usqhayllan ruwanay karqan
They want to talk, talk, talk.	Paykunaqa rimayta, rimayta, rimayta ima munanku.
So it was really about having a mindset.	Chaymi chiqaptapuni huk yuyayniyuq kaymanta karqa.
I want to know how she feels about it	Chaywanmi imayna sientekusqanmanta yachayta munani
I can't stand to hear it anymore.	Manañam aguantayta atinichu uyariyta.
I’m not going to go now	Manam kunanqa risaqchu
These people are still there.	Chay runakunaqa hinallam kachkan.
I can't do this again	Kaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atiymanchu
She was very sad and very scared.	Payqa ancha llakisqa, ancha mancharisqa ima kasqa.
Harder, faster	Aswan sinchi, aswan utqaylla
He doesn’t want to do it.	Payqa manan ruwayta munanchu.
I actually feel better	Chiqaptaqa allintam sientekuni
Tell me more about this.	Kaymanta astawan willaway.
Done.	Ñam.
I want to work again, to get better	Hukmanta llamk’ayta munani, allin kanaypaq
I never want to do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu
I felt comfortable here	Kaypiqa allintam tarikurqani
I knew you would.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I don’t really think about it much anymore	Chiqaptaqa manañam anchatachu chaypi piensani
There was so much going on.	Chaypiqa ancha achka ruwaymi karqa.
Maybe someone did it.	Ichapas pipas chayta ruwarqa.
I can’t think about it	Manam chaymantaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu
Today was a very cold day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha chiri punchawmi karqa.
He wished he’d never heard of it.	Payqa munarqanmi mana hayk’aqpas uyariyta.
I have a lot to do	Achka ruwanay kachkan
I really wanted to but I couldn’t	Anchatam munarqani ichaqa manam atirqanichu
No, it’s worse than that.	Manan, chaymanta aswan mana allinqa.
It had to be cold and hard.	Chiri, sinchi kanan karqa.
That it just can’t be true.	Chaylla mana chiqap kayta atisqanmanta.
Are you with me?.	¿Ñoqawan kuskachu kanki?.
But I will go to him tomorrow	Paqarinmi ichaqa payta risaq
It was a bad thing.	Mana allinmi karqa.
But lucky to be there today.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kunan p’unchay chaypi kayqa.
And he stayed there.	Hinan chaypi qhepakurqan.
And there I am.	Hinaspa chaypi kachkani.
I mean, it’s a big deal	Niyta munani, hatun ruwaymi
I was the only one who was scared	Ñuqallam mancharisqa karqani
It’s actually quite difficult to do.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
But for now, that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa allinmi chayqa.
I was a great guy.	Ñuqaqa hatun runam karqani.
I was pretty sure he was disappointed	Yaqa segurom karqani hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta
This is the best way to do this.	Kaymi aswan allinqa chayta ruwanapaq.
I’m there again.	Yapamanta chaypi kachkani.
We are real people.	Chiqap runakunam kanchik.
I thought a lot about that	Chaypin anchata yuyaykurqani
But it doesn’t matter what he’s doing now.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu kunan ruwasqanqa.
I am a professor at a university	Ñuqaqa huk hatun yachay wasipi yachachiqmi kani
I’m glad there’s one.	Kusikuni huk kasqanmanta.
I haven’t seen what it is, yet	Manaraqmi rikurqanichu ima kasqanmanta, manaraqmi
This is a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi.
You want to find things.	Imakunatapas tariyta munanki.
So easy for me.	Chaymi facil ñuqapaq.
I didn’t want to remember that	Chaytaqa manam yuyariyta munarqanichu
I can't stand that stuff	Manam aguantayta atinichu chay imakunatapas
I want to know what the problem is.	Ima sasachakuy kasqanmantam yachayta munani.
I want to know if they’re right	Allinchu kasqankuta yachayta munani
I always do it for him anyway	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwani imayna kaptinpas paypaq
I drove home around midnight	Kuska tuta hinam wasiyman carropi rirqani
Many people want to see it.	Achka runakunam chayta qawayta munanku.
I don’t want to walk the path	Manam munanichu ñanta puriyta
I never thought it was that big.	Manam haykapipas chayna hatun kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
Everyone is very angry now.	Kunanqa llapa runam ancha phiñasqa kachkan.
But the man later died.	Ichaqa chay runaqa qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
He was exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqañan karqan.
You are no longer that person.	Manañam chay runachu kanki.
I’ve been around for a long time	Unayñan kashani
He was always there for her.	Payqa sapa kutim paypaq karqa.
That one time.	Chay huk kutilla.
I wanted to know if it was.	Chayna kasqanta yachayta munarqani.
This is not difficult.	Kayqa mana sasachu.
Here's one here.	Kaypi huk kaypi kachkan.
Bad ugly ugly.	Mana allin millay millay.
He couldn't stand it.	Chaytaqa manam aguantayta atirqachu.
I really need to do better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allin ruwanay kashan.
I have to do it twice.	Iskay kutitam ruwanay.
Maybe you can’t talk	Ichapas mana rimayta atiwaqchu
I want to understand	Entiendeyta munani
I thought she would come back with him	Paywan kuska kutimunanta yuyaykurqani
That’s a very difficult thing.	Chayqa sinchi sasam.
There is no time for that now.	Chaypaqqa manan tiempo kanchu kunanqa.
I didn't think about it that way	Manam chaynataqa chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
She never wanted to see him again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas payta rikuyta munarqanchu.
I know this is hard	Yachanim kayqa sasa kasqanmanta
I couldn’t believe that	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu
I’m one of them.	Ñuqaqa hukninmi kani.
I can’t be here all the time	Manam tukuy tiempo kaypi kayta atiymanchu
I’m not good enough anymore	Manañam allinchu kani
I’m a city walker	Llaqtapi puriq kani
I couldn't watch this anymore	Manañam kayta qawayta atirqanichu
It is very difficult now.	Kunanqa sinchi sasam.
He had so many ideas.	Payqa ancha achka yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
The task was ridiculously large.	Chay ruwayqa asikunapaq hina hatunmi karqa.
Yes, they are.	Arí, paykunaqa kanku.
I don't understand what happened.	Manam entiendenichu ima pasasqanmantaqa.
That’s what he does all the time.	Chaytan payqa sapa kutilla ruwan.
And, why is it? 	Hinaspa, ¿imarayku?
I want to go tomorrow.	Paqarin riyta munani.
I really wanted to talk about something	Anchatam imamantapas rimayta munarqani
I would love to see you there!.	¡Anchatan munani chaypi rikuyta!.
I don't think there's anyone else here.	Manam piensanichu kaypiqa huk runa kasqanmantaqa.
But he couldn't believe it.	Ichaqa manan chayta creeyta atirqanchu.
I want to talk all night	Tukuy tuta rimayta munani
Don’t know what it is.	Ama yachankichu ima kasqanmanta.
Do the first step.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwayta ruway.
Maybe I don’t like it	Ichapas mana gustawanchu
It’s obvious.	Sut’inmi kashan.
There is nothing left now.	Kunanqa manañam imapas kanchu.
I didn’t realize that until now	Chaytaqa manan kunankamaqa repararqanichu
I can't find anything, so go.	Manam imatapas tarinichu, chaymi riy.
He knows what he’s doing.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.
I didn’t want him to be there.	Manam munarqanichu chaypi kananta.
I didn't think it would be there	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi kananta
I want him to be an adult one day	Munani huk punchaw hatun runa kananpaq
I never want to go.	Manam haykapipas riyta munanichu.
I knew that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam yacharqani
Now, it looks like he wants to talk more.	Kunanqa, aswan rimayta munanman hinam rikchakun.
You were the cold one.	Qanmi chiri karqanki.
I need to do that now	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanay
Maybe he should have been.	Ichapas payqa kanan karqa.
But I'd rather get out of there.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman chaymanta lluqsiyta.
But I think it’s going to be great	Ichaqa hatun kananta yuyaykuni
I might have to do something about it	Chaypaqqa ichapas imatapas ruwanay kanman
I didn’t want to think about it	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqanichu
It was good though.	Allinmi ichaqa karqa.
I always thought this was it	Sapa kutim piensarqani kayna kasqanmanta
I don't disagree that much	Manam chayna mana acuerdopichu kani
Sounds like a challenge.	Huk sasachakuy hinam uyarikun.
I said it would be fine	Allinmi kanqa nispaymi nirqani
That would have to do.	Chayqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
I don’t want to talk to anyone about it.	Manam piwanpas chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It’s an amazing thing.	Admirakuypaqmi imapas.
And that’s the thing.	Hinaspa chay imapas.
I think we’ve done this before.	Ñawpaqta kayta ruwasqaykumanta yuyani.
I will definitely do it again	Cheqaqtapunin yapamanta ruwasaq
He carefully retrieved every letter.	Payqa allintam sapa cartata hurqurqa.
Very cold, very difficult.	Ancha chiri, ancha sasa.
I feel like I do, but there they are.	Ñuqapas hinam tarikuni, ichaqa chaypim kachkanku.
I am still confused.	Hinallam pantasqa kachkani.
Now you’re thinking clearly.	Kunanqa allinta yuyaykunki.
So he didn’t do it right.	Chayraykum payqa mana allintachu ruwarqa.
This should be easier.	Kayqa aswan facilmi kanan.
Man what say.	Runa ima niy.
Okay, okay, once and a half.	Allinmi, allinmi, huk kuti kuskan.
Please, hurry up.	Ama hina kaspa, usqhaylla.
But that’s all.	Ichaqa chaylla.
This statement makes no sense.	Kay rimayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
So long alone.	Chayna unayta sapallan.
I feel sorry for him.	Paymanta llakisqa tarikuni.
That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
There is nothing for it.	Manam imapas chaypaqqa kanchu.
He didn't have to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwanan karqachu.
What happened to that.	Imataq chaywan pasarqa.
Good people, both of them.	Allin runakuna, iskayninku.
It sounds simple, but it is surprisingly difficult to do.	Chayqa facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa admirakuypaqmi sasa ruway.
I like that better.	Chayqa aswan allintam gustan.
There is so much to do!	¡Achka ruwana kachkan!
It’s sad really.	Llakikuypaqmi chiqaptapuni.
One is more than nothing.	Hukninmi mana imamanta aswan achka.
I could never say that.	Manam haykapipas chayta niyta atirqanichu.
Nothing big, big.	Mana imapas hatun, hatun.
Maybe once a month, twice at most.	Ichapas killapi huk kutita, iskay kutita aswan achkata.
Not three times.	Mana kimsa kutichu.
Is everything all right? 	¿Allinchu tukuy imapas?
What is the right thing to do?	¿Imatan ruwanayki?
It wasn’t that difficult.	Manam chayna sasachu karqa.
I’m really still tired	Chiqaptam kunankamapas sayk’usqa kachkani
He didn't do that well.	Manam allintachu chaynata ruwarqa.
But don’t do it.	Ichaqa ama ruwaychu.
Now, the second one.	Kunanqa, iskay kaq.
He can’t wait any longer.	Manaña suyayta atinchu.
He can do things on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi imatapas ruwanman.
He said he was fine.	Payqa allinmi nispas nisqa.
You think he’s a.	Qamqa yuyanki payqa huk.
He said he would be right back though.	Nisqa chaylla kutimunanta ichaqa.
Either that or he knows nothing.	Icha chayta icha mana imatapas yachanchu.
I don’t like coffee.	Manam kukata gustanchu.
Who are the foolish.	Mana yuyayniyuq pikuna.
I saw his name somewhere.	Maypipas sutinta rikurqani.
Be more punctual.	Astawan tiempollanpi kay.
I’m not sure you would.	Manam segurochu kani chayta ruwanaykipaq.
Sure, he was a very big man.	Seguro, payqa ancha hatun runam karqa.
Worse, there’s a great deal more he could do.	Aswan mana allinqa, kanmi hatun ruway aswan ruwayta atinman.
He can’t stop it.	Mana saqiyta atinchu.
I wish you were here with you right now.	Munaymanmi kunanpacha kaypi qanwan kasqaykita.
Maybe we should have done that.	Ichapas chayta ruwananchik karqa.
Yours.	Qampa.
I can’t do things.	Manam imakunatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
Or the adults.	Utaq hatun runakuna.
And maybe it’s better.	Hinaspa ichapas aswan allin kanman.
It was really quite easy.	Chiqamanta ancha facil karqa.
He is out of town tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam llaqtamanta hawapi kachkan.
Then he had to be sure.	Chaymantaqa segurom kanan karqa.
I had this problem all along.	Tukuy tiempon kay sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
You said it very well.	Ancha allintam nirqanki.
I’d probably be the first one.	Yaqapaschá ñawpaq kaq kayman.
This is a good practice.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi.
I can't stop it.	Manan hark'ayta atiymanchu.
Something happened, it happened.	Imapas pasarqa, pasarqa.
Nor do I need help.	Nitaq yanapayta necesitasaqchu.
They often don't.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim mana.
Someone has to do it.	Pipas ruwanan tiyan.
I am so sorry this happened.	Anchatam llakikuni kay pasasqanmanta.
He obviously doesn’t exist.	Payqa sut’inmi mana kanchu.
I knew this had to go.	Yacharqanim kayqa rinan kasqanmanta.
Of course this was considered.	Chiqamanta kayqa qhawarisqa karqa.
I think so, but I’m not sure.	Chaytan yuyaykuni, ichaqa manan segurochu.
So, that’s a no, then.	Chaymi, chayqa huk mana, chaymantaqa.
I didn’t think it was right.	Mana allintachu yuyaykurqani.
That’s a very good thing for you.	Chayqa ancha allinmi qampaq.
One knows how to cope.	Huk runaqa yachanmi imayna atipananta.
It’s sad, but it’s there.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
I doubt it ever happened now.	Iskayrayani kunan haykapipas chayna kasqanmanta.
No one, but no one, was there.	Manam pipas, ichaqa manam pipas, chaypiqa karqachu.
Yes, this is a very good thing.	Arí, kayqa ancha allinmi.
Many people are like that.	Achka runakunam chayna kanku.
Sure I do.	Seguro ruwani.
Perhaps they were.	Ichapas chayna karqaku.
Perhaps it will be useful.	Ichapas allinpaq kanqa.
This is not too difficult.	Kayqa manam ancha sasachu.
They don’t really know what it’s like now.	Paykunaqa manan allintachu yachanku kunan imayna kasqanmanta.
So far I am very happy.	Kunankamaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
He shouldn’t be here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kanan.
He has been in the city for three years.	Llaqtapiqa kimsa watañam.
But he had to go on.	Ichaqa hinallam rinan karqa.
This is kinda crazy.	Kayqa huk laya loco.
He couldn't say anything else.	Manañam niyta atirqachu.
I'm that quick.	Ñuqaqa chayna utqaylla.
You can’t do this.	Manan kaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He came to town a few weeks ago.	Payqa iskay kinsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi llaqtaman hamurqan.
Don’t be so serious.	Ama chayna serio kaychu.
So it was very difficult.	Chaymi sinchi sasa karqa.
But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
But it would be nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanman.
I couldn’t be happier.	Manan aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu.
Another day, another challenge.	Huk punchaw, huk sasachakuy.
Everyone knows what happened.	Lliwmi yachanku imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He knew it wouldn't take long.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana unaytachu pasananta.
What happened to him.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He is still very human.	Payqa kunankamapas ancha runam.
I just had to do it.	Chayllaraqmi ruwanay karqa.
It really is that important.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina importante.
You knew nothing about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqankichu.
He couldn't think.	Payqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
He shouldn’t have had to.	Payqa manan chayta ruwananchu kanman karqan.
I wonder what’s in it.	Tapukuni imataq chaypi kachkan.
There is beauty here.	Kaypiqa sumaq kaymi kachkan.
You know not to do that.	Yachankim mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I am very, very happy with it.	Ancha ancha kusisqam kachkani chaywan.
I thought it was really great.	Chiqap hatun kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I couldn’t stop talking about you.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu qammanta rimayta.
Despite everything, he pulled it off.	Tukuy ima kaptinpas, chaytam hurqurqa.
He is very hurt and sad.	Payqa ancha k’irisqa, llakisqa ima kashan.
It would have been later.	Qhepamanmi kanman karqan.
It’s unthinkable.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi.

They are beautiful people.	Paykunaqa sumaq runakunam.
I mean, probably.	Niyta munani, yaqapaschá.
He didn't want to see her.	Payqa manan payta rikuyta munarqanchu.
Now he couldn't do anything about it.	Kunanqa manan chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
Maybe he wants one now.	Ichapas kunan hukta munan.
This probably doesn't have to happen every day.	Kayqa manachá sapa punchawchu kanan.
I don't understand why this is happening.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kayna kasqanmanta.
There is no time anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam tiempo kanchu.
He does something	Imatapas ruwan .
It took about a week.	Huk semana hinam pasarqa.
He probably was.	Payqa yaqapaschá karqan.
I think, anyway.	Yuyaykuni, imayna kaptinpas.
If he has not already done so.	Sichus manaraq ruwarqanchu chayqa.
It would be nice if you did.	Allinmi kanman chayta ruwaptikiqa.
I could have done a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwayman karqa.
Black black black.	Tuta yana yana.
I think that was the first step.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
I was a player.	Ñuqaqa pukllaqmi karqani.
He tried to catch her, but couldn’t.	Payqa hap’iyta munarqan, ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I’m listening to it, too.	Ñuqapas uyarini.
He doesn’t have to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwananchu.
He’s not alone.	Manan sapallanchu.
I think it was good for him.	Paypaq allin kasqanmantam piensani.
So it would be a good time.	Chaymi allin tiempo kanman.
I'm doing better now, really.	Kunanqa aswan allintam ruwachkani, chiqaptapuni.
Lots of cold, wet weather.	Achka chiri, chiri pacha.
He knew there was a problem.	Payqa yacharqanmi huk sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Now, go ahead.	Kunanqa, riy.
It’s been a long time since it mattered.	Unayñan imapaqpas allin kasqanmanta.
They want to do the right thing.	Paykunaqa allintam ruwayta munanku.
It was meant to be that way.	Chayna kananpaqmi karqa.
Not the first time, either.	Mana ñawpaq kutichu, nitaq.
Everyone knows you're hurting.	Lliwmi yachanku k'irisqa kasqaykita.
He gave way.	Payqa ñanta qorqan.
You are a very good guy.	Qamqa ancha allinmi kanki.
Obviously you’re not ready.	Sut’inmi mana listochu kashanki.
He is right here.	Kaypiqa allintam rimachkan.
I really don't believe that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa creenichu.
As usual, it wasn't.	Sapa kuti hinam mana karqachu.
He wanted to get out.	Payqa lluqsiyta munarqa.
What do you do about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwanki?.
He was with me last night.	Payqa qayna tutam ñuqawan karqa.
I don’t want to go alone.	Manam sapallay riyta munanichu.
A lot in fact.	Achka chiqaptaqa.
But we are sure that will not happen.	Ichaqa segurom kachkaniku chayna mana kananmanta.
Something always does, you know.	Imapas sapa kutim ruwan, yachanki.
He couldn't see her yet.	Payqa manaraqmi rikuyta atirqachu.
So be good.	Chaymi allin kay.
That’s something I always enjoy.	Chayqa sapa kutim kusikuni.
He just did it right away.	Chayllaraqmi ruwarqa.
But things were funny.	Ichaqa imapas asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I have never been there before.	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa rirqanichu.
It just all that didn't mean much.	Chaylla tukuy chay mana anchatachu niyta munarqa.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen.	Yacharqanim mana chayna kananta.
I’m happy to be around.	Kusisqam kachkani.
I'm not that happy about it.	Manam chayna kusisqachu kani chaymantaqa.
But he’s not sure where he is now .	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan kunan maypi kasqanmanta .
Now then, I do sometimes.	Kunanqa chaymanta, wakin kutipi ruwani.
He was a lonely man.	Payqa sapallan runam karqa.
Maybe it was a few nights ago.	Ichapas iskay kimsa tutamanta karqa.
I would be very busy.	Ancha ocupasqa kayman.
The present time period.	Kunan pacha pacha.
It’s not the best.	Mana aswan allinchu.
He wanted to talk again.	Hukmanta rimayta munarqa.
Now it makes more sense.	Kunanqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi.
Something there, maybe.	Imapas chaypi, ichapas.
Second, he loves to play the game.	Iskay kaq, payqa anchatam munan pukllayta pukllayta.
It looks very strange.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
It wasn’t too bad there.	Mana ancha mana allinchu karqan chaypi.
It looks really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
Whatever it is, do it immediately!.	Imapas kaptinpas, ¡chaylla ruway!.
What was, was.	Imataq karqa, karqa.
He was a mysterious man.	Payqa pakasqa runam karqa.
So say why and do better.	Chaymi imarayku niy hinaspa aswan allinta ruway.
But this wasn’t right.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu kasharqan.
Young, but beautiful.	Wayna, ichaqa sumaq.
I don’t know his real name.	Manam yachanichu chiqap sutinta.
So don’t do that.	Chaymi ama chaytaqa ruwaychu.
He looked up, hurt.	Payqa qhawarisqa, k’irisqa.
people are eager to learn.	runakunaqa anchatam munanku yachayta.
Maybe you know why.	Ichapas yachanki imanasqa kasqanmanta.
There was something there.	Chaypim imapas karqa.
He’s really sick.	Chiqamanta unqusqa kachkan.
This can't last long.	Kayqa manam unaytachu kanman.
They are all ready.	Llapallankum listo kachkanku.
I've got it .	Ñuqaqa chayta hap'ini.
He knew how good it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna allin kasqanta.
It makes more sense.	Aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi.
Why is this wrong.	Imaraykutaq kay pantasqa kachkan.
I take it for what it is.	Ima kasqanmantam hapini.
I was really serious.	Cheqaqtapunin serio karqani.
He couldn’t believe how easy it was.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu imayna facil kasqanta.
He didn't know what he was saying.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima nisqanta.
You’re right, you’re right.	Qamqa allintam kachkanki.
There has to be a better way to do it.	Aswan allin ruwaymi kanan.
I did it, again and again.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, yapamanta yapamanta.
He said it every week.	Payqa sapa semanan chayta nisqa.
There was never anything there.	Chaypiqa manam haykapipas imapas karqachu.
He couldn't hear her.	Payqa manam uyariyta atirqachu.
I don’t know what happened there.	Manam yachanichu chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Herein lies the problem.	Kaypim kachkan chay sasachakuy.
You are amazing.	Qamqa admirakuypaqmi kanki.
More than nothing else.	Mana imamanta aswan achka.
I think that is unfortunate.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi piensani.
Where did this come from.	Maymantataq kayqa hamurqa.
He looked like he always did.	Payqa sapa kuti hinam rikchakurqa.
It’s not me.	Manam ñuqachu.
That, however, is not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
But this was winter.	Ichaqa kayqa chiri tiempon karqan.
I'm, I'm.	Ñuqa, nispa.
But perhaps this was not always the case.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
This would have to do.	Kayqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
You’re not good enough.	Manam allinchu kanki.
He thought better of it.	Payqa aswan allintan chaypi yuyaykurqan.
He probably needs it.	Yaqapaschá necesitan.
Every time something like that happened.	Sapa kutim chayna imapas pasarqa.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqan.
Again, this is not difficult.	Yapamanta, kayqa manam sasachu.
No one was sure why.	Manam pipas segurochu karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
All of this above.	Tukuy kay hawapi.
I think that was huge.	Chayqa hatunmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
It probably would have been better outside.	Yaqapaschá aswan allin kanman karqan hawapi.
And next year won’t be any better.	Hinaspa hamuq wata mana aswan allinchu kanqa.
That doesn’t seem like me.	Chayqa manan ñoqa hinachu rikch’akun.
Now, be honest.	Kunanqa, chiqap kay.
Anyway, he was never there.	Imayna kaptinpas, payqa manam haykapipas chaypiqa karqachu.
You make the first payment.	Ñawpaq kaq qullqita ruwanki.
At least that’s what I like.	Aswanpas chaytan gustan.
He was angry, hurt and angry.	Payqa phiñasqa, k’irisqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
No one knows yet who will return.	Manaraqmi pipas yachanchu pikuna kutimunanta.
I do, anyway.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, imayna kaptinpas.
I still don't really get it.	Kunankamapas manam chiqaptachu hapini.
But seriously, that’s crazy.	Ichaqa serio, chayqa loco.
Know that you are doing the best you can.	Yachay atisqaykita allinta ruwasqaykita.
You can’t do any better.	Manan aswan allinta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He told me to do my best for you.	Paymi niwarqa tukuy atisqaykita qampaq ruwanaypaq.
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Ichapas paqarin chisi.
Obviously, he did.	Sut’inmi, chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I wanted to be here.	Kaypi kaytam munarqani.
But it's obviously wrong.	Ichaqa sut'inmi mana allinchu.
I never expected the big things of the past.	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu ñawpaq tiempopi hatun ruwaykunata.
Don’t do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwaychu.
This was no big deal.	Kayqa manam hatun ruwaychu karqa.
I shouldn't have him here.	Manam paytaqa kaypichu kanay karqa.
Not easy, never easy.	Mana facilchu, mana haykapipas facilchu.
Man, that stuff is good.	Runa, chay imapas allinmi.
You know, it’s funny.	Yachanki, asikunapaq hina.
Thank you again.	Yapamanta gracias.
I absolutely agree.	Ñuqaqa allintam acuerdopi kani.
I had never done that before, so it was good.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu, chaymi allin karqa.
I know they are not mine.	Yachanim mana ñuqapa kasqankuta.
There was some action.	Wakin ruwaymi karqan.
Two weeks ago.	Iskay semana ñawpaqta.
I wish you wouldn’t.	Munayman mana ruwanaykita.
Maybe he really doesn't want to leave.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni mana munanmanchu ripuyta.
More like a smile.	Aswan hina.
Obviously he really was.	Sut’inmi cheqaqtapuni payqa karqan.
So this is a big one.	Chaymi kayqa hatun.
I didn’t want to leave the city.	Manam chay llaqtamanta lluqsiyta munarqanichu.
I could never understand that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas entiendeyta atirqanichu.
But things are better now.	Ichaqa kunanqa aswan allinmi imapas.
But this is what does it.	Ichaqa kaymi chayta ruwan.
I knew you wanted to hear about it.	Yacharqanim chaymanta uyariyta munasqaykita.
He couldn’t have done it.	Payqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
Anyway, thanks for that.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymanta gracias.
So we have to do the right thing.	Chaymi allinta ruwananchik.
I was so glad he knew.	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani pay yachasqanmanta.
No one would want to be human.	Manan pipas runa hina kayta munanmanchu.
Better not.	Aswan allinmi mana.
I want to go again.	Hukmanta riyta munani.
So it’s very difficult.	Chaymi sinchi sasa.
Yes, but you have to do it right.	Arí, ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwanayki.
I think you’ll be very happy.	Yuyaykuni ancha kusisqa kanki.
And then he immediately knew exactly what he was going to do.	Hinaspa chaymanta chay rato allinta yacharqan ima ruwananta.
I’m with someone.	Piwanpas kachkani.
But it was very difficult.	Ichaqa llumpay sasam karqa.
I am so happy to be able to share this.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kayta willayta atisqaymanta.
But today there was none.	Ichaqa kunan punchawqa manam karqachu.
That’s the worst thing about him but you never know.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi paymanta ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
He knew .	Payqa yacharqanmi .
He told me to do it again.	Paymi niwarqa hukmanta ruwanaykupaq.
It was really nice.	Chiqaptam sumaq karqa.
Now here is a problem.	Kunanqa kaypi huk sasachakuy kachkan.
I don’t understand how much happens.	Manam entiendenichu imayna achka pasasqanmanta.
We cannot do without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam ruwayta atichwanchu.
I think he’ll never know the truth.	Yuyaykuni cheqaq kaqta mana hayk’aqpas yachananta.
I am really sad today.	Chiqaptam kunan punchaw llakisqa kachkani.
I'm sure it exists.	Seguro kani kasqanmanta.
Of course, it’s not that simple.	Arí, manan chay hina facilchu.
That’s what you’re doing.	Chaytachu ruwachkanki.
I don't really know what the problem is.	Manam allintachu yachani ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Something was seriously wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas sinchi mana allinmi karqa.
I was there for the guy.	Ñuqaqa chaypim karqani.
They want you to do what you used to do.	Paykunaqa munanku ñawpaqpi hina ruwanaykita.
This is what you really mean to me.	Kaymi chiqaptapuni ñuqapaq niyta munanki.
I can’t stand to be anywhere for long.	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu maypipas unayta kaytaqa.
But he refused, of course.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu, cheqaqtapunin.
All more than one.	Llapan hukmanta aswan.
They are in the school.	Yachay wasipi kachkanku.
I’m not really good.	Manam chiqap allinchu kani.
But it’s all good.	Ichaqa llapan allin.
It’s very much out there.	Anchatam hawapi kachkan.
I want to hear about it.	Chaymanta uyariyta munani.
He was eager to help.	Payqa anchatan munarqan imapipas yanapayta.
Maybe he’s sick.	Ichapas payqa unqusqa kachkan.
He wanted to tell her that.	Chayta willayta munarqa.
It’s there, of course.	Chaypin kashan, sut’inmi.
No, not really, but it probably was.	Manam, manam chiqaptachu, ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
But then, maybe he was.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas payqa karqan.
You don’t know why.	Mana yachankichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But he didn’t want to tell her, not yet.	Ichaqa manan willayta munarqanchu, manaraqmi.
Or a child.	Utaq huk wawa.
I was absolutely stupid about everything.	Ñuqaqa tukuy imamanta chiqaptam sonso karqani.
I know it’s me.	Yachanim ñuqa kasqayta.
If you can’t see it on your own, it’s too bad.	Sichus sapallayki mana rikuyta atiwaqchu chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
I know you are not.	Yachanim mana kasqaykita.
And so they are sometimes.	Hinaspa chayna kanku wakin kuti.
That’s the safest thing to do.	Chayqa aswan seguro ruwaymi.
I felt like he was mine.	Payqa ñuqapa hinam tarikurqani.
Maybe it actually was.	Ichapas chiqaptaqa chayna karqa.
No one goes alone.	Manam pipas sapallanchu rin.
But he went with it.	Ichaqa chaywanmi rirqa.
Unfortunately it didn't go so well.	Llakikuypaqmi mana chayna allintachu rirqa.
Have a different mindset.	Huk chikan yuyayniyuq kay.
First, have an appearance.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk rikchayniyuq kay.
I need to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwanay.
Yes, it looked great there.	Arí, chaypiqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Usually during the week.	Yaqa llapanpim semanapi.
He was so much more than me.	Payqa anchatan ñoqamanta aswan askha karqan.
I couldn’t get out fast enough.	Manam utqaylla lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
So that’s going to be huge.	Chaymi chayqa hatun kanqa.
I’m all excited about it.	Llapallankum kusikuni.
However, it is not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu.
Probably both of them.	Yaqapaschá iskayninku.
He would love to know.	Payqa anchatam munanman yachayta.
That was nothing human.	Chayqa manan imapas runachu karqan.
Much better than me.	Ancha aswan allin ñuqamanta.
But something is better than nothing.	Ichaqa imapas aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
He stayed hard.	Payqa sinchitan qhepakurqan.
I know exactly what it is like.	Allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta.
I never knew what happened with it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chaywan ima pasasqanmantaqa.
But at the moment, he has no choice.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
I don't know how to fix this problem.	Manam yachanichu kay sasachakuy allichayta.
Everyone knows this is true.	Lliwmi yachanku kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
He had to, he always did.	Payqa ruwanan karqan, sapa kutillanmi ruwaq.
So it’s hard.	Chaymi sasa.
This is all about making things better.	Kayqa tukuy imapas allin kananpaqmi.
What to do next, he had no idea.	Chaymanta ima ruwananta, manas ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
One is the weather.	Hukninmi pacha.
It looks like nothing.	Mana imapas hinam rikchakun.
He had never done that before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay ruwaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I didn’t want him.	Manam paytaqa munarqanichu.
He knew very well.	Payqa ancha allintam yacharqa.
I want him fired.	Munani qarqusqa kananpaq.
He said he had to do the right thing.	Paymi nirqa allin kaqta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
Now here is why.	Kunanqa kaypim kachkan imarayku.
This day really went by really fast.	Kay punchawqa chiqaptam pasarqa chiqap utqaylla.
It was truly amazing.	Chiqamanta admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Like last month.	Qayna killa hina.
That’s all, it’s not this.	Chaylla, mana kaychu.
Not happy the second time around.	Mana kusisqachu iskay kaq kutipi.
He has always been this way.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kayna karqa.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Manam, mikuyta munan, nispas nin.
Everyone was unafraid.	Lliwmi mana mancharisqa karqaku.
I did a bad job.	Mana allintam ruwarqani.
That's the next big thing.	Chayqa qatiqnin hatun kaqmi.
Hopefully he gets over it soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla chayta atipananta.
That seems innocent.	Chayqa mana huchayoq hinam.
I didn’t go, though.	Ñuqam ichaqa mana rirqanichu.
I’m glad he did so well.	Kusikuni ancha allinta ruwasqanmanta.
Don't know if this is one.	Ama yachankichu kay huknin kasqanmanta.
Young, really nice.	Wayna, chiqap sumaq.
Not exactly two people together.	Manam allintachu iskay runakuna kuska.
And a big deal tonight.	Hinaspa kunan tuta hatun ruway.
Nobody knows how.	Manan pipas yachanchu imaynatachus chayta.
The man is the head.	Runaqa uma.
She was horrified at the thought.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan chay yuyaykusqanmanta.
I’m sure it’s great.	Seguro kani ancha allin kasqanmanta.
And being good.	Hinaspa allin kay.
I feel proud of myself.	Ñuqaqa orgulloso hinam tarikuni.
And even when it’s there.	Hinaspa chaypi kaptinpas.
You are who you are.	Qanmi kanki pi kasqaykita.
They are happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqam kachkanku.
But what a job it is.	Ichaqa ima ruwaymi.
Maybe you just want him.	Ichapas chaylla payta munanki.
There is no point in doing otherwise.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​huk hina ruwayqa.
This is what he is.	Kaymi payqa.
And actually, it’s very difficult.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, ancha sasa.
You usually can't do that.	Yaqa llapanpim mana chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
There it is, time.	Chaypin kashan, pacha.
People are people.	Runakunaqa runakunam.
He died of his injuries later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepamanmi k’irisqa kasqanmanta wañupurqan.
Not here though.	Mana kaypichu ichaqa.
I am here now.	Kunanqa kaypim kachkani.
But he probably did.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
He really wanted to talk to you.	Payqa anchatan qanwan rimayta munarqan.
You can't tell me about that.	Chaymantaqa manam willayta atiwaqchu.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out.	Llakikuypaqmi mana allinchu karqa.
They were very happy with it.	Chaywanqa ancha kusisqam karqaku.
Preferably someone else.	Aswan allinqa huk runam.
I mean, a lot.	Niyta munani, achkata.
Unfortunately, he has no choice.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
You don't know it's there anymore.	Manañam yachankichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa.
I really want to see it.	Anchatam qawayta munani.
This was the reality.	Kaymi chiqap kaq karqa.
He was the one for me.	Paymi ñuqapaq kaq karqa.
Okay, maybe not.	Allinmi, ichapas mana.
That’s really important.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ancha importante.
Probably won’t be though.	Yaqapaschá mana kanqachu ichaqa.
He looked too tired to say anything.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa mana imatapas rimananpaq.
He doesn't want to leave.	Payqa manam lluqsiyta munanchu.
They are the very.	Paykunaqa chay ancha.
But first of all, yes.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa arí.
It’s better to talk about you.	Aswan allinmi qanmanta rimayqa.
I didn’t know any other way to do it.	Manam huk ñanta yacharqanichu chayta ruwanaypaq.
And maybe it does.	Hinaspa ichapas chayna kanman.
He goes last night.	Qayna tutan rin.
I could never be this.	Manam haykapipas kayta atiymanchu karqa.
Maybe he couldn’t talk to you.	Ichapas mana qamwan rimayta atirqachu.
Go do what you do with it.	Riy chaywan ruwasqaykita ruway.
I was better off.	Aswan allinmi karqani.
He’s more afraid of you than he is.	Payqa aswan manchakunmi qanmanta paymanta.
But the process was not agreed.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa mana acuerdopichu karqan.
The man is really there.	Chay runaqa chiqaptam chaypi kachkan.
Fast, fast, fast.	Utqaylla, utqaylla, utqaylla.
Whether it’s good or bad.	Allin kaptinpas mana allin kaptinpas.
It’s been about three years.	Yaqa kimsa watañam.
But I can’t find it.	Ichaqa manan tariyta atinichu.
That was two months ago.	Chayqa iskay killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I knew this was the case.	Kaytaqa yacharqanim.
If he ever did that.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas chayta ruwarqan chayqa.
He wanted to be a success.	Payqa allin ruwaq kaytan munarqan.
Now it’s you.	Kunanqa qanmi kanki.
Ten times.	Chunka kutita.
It’s really easy.	Chiqamanta facilmi.
Therefore, speeding up this work is desirable.	Chayraykum kay llamkayta utqaylla ruwayqa munan.
But you keep doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam ruwanki.
I want things to be better.	Munani imapas aswan allin kananpaq.
That was the other day.	Chayqa huk punchawmi karqa.
Now, say it.	Kunanqa, niy.
Then, there’s a problem.	Chaymanta, kan huk sasachakuy.
It’s the craziest thing in the world.	Chayqa kay pachapi aswan loco kaqmi.
He sounds drunk.	Payqa machasqa hinam uyarikun.
Not a bad guy.	Mana millay runa.
He’s in something.	Payqa imapipas kachkan.
I can't work that way.	Chaynataqa manam llamkayta atiymanchu.
I can do a lot with it.	Chaywanmi achkata ruwayman.
I’ve done that.	Ñuqaqa chayta ruwarqani.
You don’t want to make a statement about yourself.	Manan munankichu qanmanta willakuyta ruwayta.
I have no idea what he’s doing.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima ruwasqanmanta.
He really does a job.	Payqa chiqaptam huk llamkayta ruwan.
And be like that.	Hinaspa chayna kay.
This year’s end.	Kay wata tukuy.
It was a great experience!.	¡Ancha allinmi karqa!.
Instead, we are here.	Aswanpas kaypim kachkaniku.
The man is very good at home.	Chay runaqa wasinpi ancha allinmi.
In this world or in the future.	Kay pachapi utaq hamuq pachapi.
But happy this time, really.	Ichaqa kusisqa kay kutipi, cheqaqtapuni.
John, who lived there.	Juan, chaypi tiyaq.
Learn how for you.	Yachay imaynatachus qampaq.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
I don’t want to help him.	Manam payta yanapayta munanichu.
But I can’t wait.	Ichaqa manan suyayta atiymanchu.
I didn’t want to hear about it.	Mana chaymanta uyariyta munarqanichu.
We pretty much agree on that.	Chaypiqa yaqapaschá acuerdopi kayku.
I know that must be difficult.	Yachanim chayqa sasa kananta.
Do it for me, please, she says.	Ruway ñuqapaq, ama hina kaspa, nispas nin.
He would be like that.	Payqa chayna kanman.
You want it so much.	Anchatam munanki.
But you can’t tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta atiwaqchu.
He doesn’t know who you are yet.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu pi kasqaykita.
That’s the only thing that can happen.	Chayllam kanman.
Before that, actually.	Manaraq chaymanta, chiqaptaqa.
He still wasn't sure who it was.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasharqan pichus chay kasqanmanta.
But everything went well.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allintam pasarqa.
Let me know if you want to know more.	Astawan yachayta munaspaqa willaway.
He really should.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanan.
I know what it is.	Yachanim imata.
People love to talk.	Runakunaqa anchatam munanku rimayta.
But only once.	Ichaqa huk kutilla.
Seriously this is me.	Serio kaymi kachkani.
I can't imagine why she once feared him.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinichu imarayku huk kutipi payta manchakusqanmanta.
I would have done the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwasaq karqa.
There had to be someone else.	Huk runam kanan karqa.
I wonder if this will be good.	Tapukuni sichus kay allin kanqa.
They are the real thing.	Paykunaqa chiqap kaqmi.
There is some truth to this.	Kaypiqa kanmi wakin chiqap kaq.
Nothing could stop him here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas harkayta atirqachu.
But that wasn’t a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
It would probably be very useful.	Yaqapaschá ancha allin kanman.
I’m real quick.	Chiqap utqayllam kani.
But, actually, this was better.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa, kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
But he couldn’t fix it.	Ichaqa manan allichayta atirqanchu.
This is humanity.	Kayqa runa kaymi.
They were human beings.	Paykunaqa runam karqaku.
This is what I want.	Kaytam munani.
But for now, he can do what he can.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa atisqanman hinan ruwanman.
But it’s better than nothing.	Ichaqa mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
Like, really late.	Imayna, chiqap tarde.
So ridiculously handsome.	Chaymi asikunapaq hina sumaq rikchayniyuq.
What you think you’re going to do.	Imatachus ruwanaykita yuyanki.
You’d think he’d be proud.	Payqa orgulloso kananpaqmi yuyaykunki.
But for now she longed to see him.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa anchatan munarqan payta rikuyta.
I still can't believe anyone would do that.	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu pipas chayta ruwananta.
The man doesn’t do that.	Chay runaqa manam chaytaqa ruwanchu.
If the .	Sichus chay.
Obviously, you’re the one.	Sut’inmi, qanmi kanki chay runaqa.
I don't think it is.	Manam piensanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
He looked really good, despite his size.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta rikchakurqa, hatun kaptinpas.
More on that, please.	Astawan chaymanta, ama hina kaspa.
I hadn’t heard that before.	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa uyarirqanichu.
Now everything went well.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
He wouldn’t be able to walk.	Payqa manan puriyta atinmanchu karqan.
You know everything.	Tukuy imatam yachanki.
I can’t think of a good way not to help.	Manam allintachu yuyaymanayta atiyman mana yanapanaypaq.
He barely knew how to talk.	Payqa yaqapaschá rimayta yacharqan.
We did a different thing.	Huk chikan ruwayta ruwarqayku.
I know it is not such an easy thing to do.	Yachanim mana chayna facil ruway kasqanmanta.
But ‘this’ was wrong.	Ichaqa ‘kayqa’ mana allinmi karqan.
Some, not so much.	Wakin, mana anchatachu.
That should usually do it.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim ruwanan.
I said it was okay.	Allinmi nispaymi nirqani.
I know it's that stupid.	Yachanim chayna sonso kasqanmanta.
He’s good, but not that good.	Payqa allinmi, ichaqa manan chay hina allinchu.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Manañam chayna segurochu kani.
We’re right there.	Chaypim kachkaniku.
I am so glad he did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chay ruwasqanmanta.
The reason for that is this.	Chaypaqqa kaymi.
It’s best not to say too much.	Aswan allinmi mana llumpayta niy.
But of course he couldn’t hold it.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana hap’iyta atirqanchu.
There is no point in that.	Chaypaqqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I know he will do it.	Yachanim chayta ruwananta.
But there will be something.	Ichaqa kanqa imapas.
But, who knows.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq yachan.
So cold all night.	Chayna chiri tukuy tuta.
In this house.	Kay wasipi.
They are not there.	Paykunaqa mana chaypichu kachkanku.
I don’t remember when.	Manam yuyarinichu haykapi.
He probably thought it was better than it actually was.	Payqa yaqapaschá yuyaykurqan cheqaq kasqanmantaqa aswan allin kananpaq.
If you don’t succeed, that’s fine.	Sichus mana allintachu ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
He doesn’t know about me.	Payqa manan ñoqamanta yachanchu.
Anyway, here I am.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim kachkani.
Home.	Wasi.
And that’s what he did.	Hinaspa chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
I think that looks better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi rikchakun nispam piensani.
Actually, less than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymanta aswan pisi.
They know it’s going to be bad.	Paykunaqa yachanku mana allin kananta.
To do it twice.	Iskay kutita ruwanapaq.
So he said, 'It's.	Chaymi payqa nirqa.
But that was something.	Ichaqa chayqa imapas karqan.
After that, the last one.	Chay qhepamanmi qhepa kaq.
It wasn’t meant to be.	Manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
Now he really knows.	Kunanqa cheqaqtapunin yachan.
If not, please let me know.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa willaway.
He did a very bad job.	Ancha mana allintam ruwarqa.
And this moment.	Hinaspa kay rato.
But nothing was wrong.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana allinchu karqan.
It would be nice if that was easier than harder.	Allinmi kanman sichus chay aswan facil kanman aswan sasa.
Certainly it could be anywhere.	Chiqamanta maypipas kanman.
No one wanted to do anything.	Manan pipas ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.

This is an easy one.	Kayqa huk facilmi.
I knew it was now or never.	Yacharqanim kunan utaq mana haykapipas kasqanmanta.
It was a good day.	Chayqa allin punchawmi karqa.
Everything was ridiculous.	Tukuy imapas asikunapaq hinam karqa.
But this was a bad thing.	Ichaqa kayqa mana allinmi karqa.
I was just there.	Chayllaraqmi karqani.

This is an easy thing to do.	Kayqa facil ruwaymi.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Mana kunan punchawchu chayqa, paqarin.
That was me, too.	Chayqa ñuqapas karqani.
Most of the time they were drunk.	Yaqa llapanpim machasqa karqaku.
No one wanted to be the speaker.	Manan pipas munarqanchu chay rimaq kayta.
That would make everything better.	Chayqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwanman.
It was a good thing he did.	Allinmi karqan chayta ruwasqanqa.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manan millay ruwaychu.
It wasn’t so true.	Manan chhayna cheqaqchu karqan.
But no one said that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa nirqanchu.
You are a rich man.	Qamqa qhapaq runam kanki.
You’ll know better.	Aswan allinta yachanki.
But he never seems to get around to doing so.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta ruwananpaqqa puriq hinachu.
It won’t always be that way.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanqa.
Then one after that.	Chaymanta huk chaymanta.
Do this job.	Kay llamkayta ruway.
I thought he was sick.	Unqusqa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
How do you plan to do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwanaykipaq yuyaykunki.
People, it’s not like that.	Runakuna, mana chaynatachu.
I want something a little different.	Huk chikan imatapas munani.
I do it every night.	Sapa tutan chaytaqa ruwani.
But I think it would be great.	Ichaqa piensani ancha allinmi kanman.
That’s what he told me, himself.	Chaytan niwarqan, pay kikin.
I don’t know which one it is.	Manam yachanichu mayqin kasqanmantaqa.
The first is the second.	Ñawpaq kaq iskay kaq.
So what’s new.	Chaymi ima musuq.
He didn’t, he certainly didn’t.	Payqa manan ruwarqanchu, cheqaqtapunin mana ruwarqanchu.
It went faster.	Aswan utqayllam rirqa.
I have never experienced such beauty in an hour drive.	Manam haykapipas huk hora carropi chayna sumaq kaytaqa rikurqanichu.
It makes it easier.	Aswan facilmi chayta ruwan.
You can’t get that anywhere else.	Chaytaqa manan maypipas chayayta atiwaqchu.
She said things could be worse.	Payqa nirqanmi imapas aswan mana allin kanman nispa.
He is the truth.	Paymi chiqap kaq.
I may not be able to help you with everything.	Manapaschá tukuy imamantapas yanapayta atiymanchu.
Say each word.	Sapa simita niy.
There this was.	Chaypim kayqa karqa.
He had no idea where he was going.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu mayman rinanpaq.
I just found out it happened.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqani chay pasasqanmanta.
I can't quite figure this out.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu yuyaymanayta atiyman.
All right, tell me.	Allinmi, willaway.
We are not good enough for you.	Manam allinchu kayku qampaq.
Another interesting thing.	Huk sumaq kaq.
He had no idea why.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imarayku chayta.
I always like to be sure.	Sapa kutim gustan seguro kayta.
You’re serious.	Qamqa serio kanki.
But then, he would do it.	Ichaqa chaymanta, payqa ruwanman karqan.
No one is not like him.	Manan pipas mana pay hinachu.
But people are not easy.	Ichaqa runakunaqa manan facilchu kanku.
Evening meal.	Ch’isi mikhuy.
However, he does have some things working for him.	Ichaqa, payqa kanmi wakin imakuna paypaq llank’ashan.
I know it’s not.	Yachanim mana.
But if it isn’t.	Ichaqa mana chayna kaptinqa.
I just couldn’t do what I was supposed to do.	Chaylla mana ruwanaypaq ruwayta atirqanichu.
He’s got it.	Chayta hap’isqa.
He couldn’t stop her, she said.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atirqanchu, nispas nin.
But I had no idea at the time.	Ichaqa manan chay tiempopiqa imatapas yuyaykurqanichu.
It was very difficult man.	Ancha sasam karqa runa.
This cannot be said.	Kaytaqa manam niyta atichwanchu.
Yes, he really wanted to be with her.	Arí, payqa anchatan paywan kayta munarqan.
You are here with me.	Qamqa kaypim kachkanki ñuqawan.
But he wants her to know what is going to happen.	Ichaqa munanmi imakuna pasananta yachananta.
I'd be injured.	K'irisqa kayman.
You’re right there.	Allinmi chaypi kanki.
They were very good people.	Ancha allin runakunam karqaku.
So it could be again.	Chaymi hukmanta kanman.
It cannot be more than one.	Mana hukmanta aswan kayta atinchu.
He had to be consistent.	Payqa chayman hinam kanan karqa.
But he was never able to find a job.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas llank’anata tariyta atirqanchu.
There is, however,.	Kanmi ichaqa,.
The first time he was in the hospital for three months.	Ñawpaq kutipi kimsa killa hospitalpi karqa.
That would be the third.	Chayqa kinsa kaqmi kanman.
I can’t say anything.	Manam imata niyta atiymanchu.
That’s something else.	Chayqa huk imapas.
That was the right thing to do.	Chayqa allinmi karqan chayta ruwanapaq.
It sounds ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
But it wouldn’t have worked.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman karqan.
Maybe you’re crazy.	Ichapas loco kanki.
It wasn’t like anything else.	Manam huk hinachu karqa.
Much, much harder to actually do.	Aswan, aswan sasa chiqap ruwayqa.
I don’t care about anything.	Manam imananpaschu imamantapas.
Sad people want other people to be sad.	Llakisqa runakunaqa munanku huk runakuna llakisqa kananta.
That’s the people.	Chayqa runakunam.
One person was injured.	Huk runa k’irisqa.
Let’s hope it’s the latter.	Suyasun qhepa kaq kananta.
That could be tomorrow.	Chayqa paqarinmi kanman.
From another country.	Huk llaqtamanta.
That means he knows stuff.	Chayqa niyta munan, payqa yachanmi imakunatapas.
I was supposed to be here.	Kaypim kanay karqa.
Maybe it was him.	Ichapas pay karqa.
I don’t know if anything will help.	Mana yachanichu imapas yanapananta.
The day is cold.	P’unchawqa chiri.
Almost hard and cold.	Yaqa sinchi hinaspa chiri.
But it is not!.	Ichaqa manan!.
I really can’t wait for that!.	¡Chiqaptaqa mana chayta suyayta atiymanchu!.
However, there were a few people.	Ichaqa, iskay kimsa runakunam karqa.
I can't answer that.	Chaymantaqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu.
What is? 	¿Imataq?
They're huge, you know.	Paykunaqa hatun hatunmi, yachanki.
Great teacher.	Hatun yachachiq.
Maybe one day there will be some real knowledge.	Ichapas huk punchaw wakin chiqap yachay kanqa.
I would have done the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayman karqa.
And that’s what you do every month.	Hinaspa chaytaqa sapa killa ruwanki.
But don’t do it again.	Ichaqa ama hukmanta ruwaychu.
He never said what it was.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas nirqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
They were the big one.	Paykunaqa hatun kaqmi karqaku.
He wanted to leave like the best.	Payqa aswan allin kaq hinam ripuyta munarqa.
Adults every year.	Kuraq runakuna sapa wata.
It’s the people.	Runakunam.
We have done this several times.	Chaytaqa achka kutitam ruwarqayku.
I think that makes it worse.	Chaymi aswan mana allinta ruwan, nispan yuyaykuni.
He wasn't very good anyway.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu karqa imayna kaptinpas.
But this is not the best way.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan allinchu.
Then two, then three.	Chaymanta iskay, chaymanta kimsa.
This will need to be done quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwana kanqa.
One night in the city.	Huk tuta llaqtapi.
I'm still hoping someone does, but someone other than me.	Hinallam suyachkani pipas chayta ruwananta, ichaqa pipas mana ñuqa kananta.
Unless he can remember more.	Manachus astawan yuyariyta atinman chayqa.
He’s the best in his position.	Payqa aswan allinmi maypi kasqanpi.
He probably didn't.	Yaqapaschá mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
However, this can be a very difficult task.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi kanman.
I mean, yes, I do.	Arí niyta munani.
You are welcome.	Imamanta.
And that’s what it did.	Hinaspa chaymi chayta ruwarqa.
She knew he was married.	Payqa yacharqanmi casarasqa kasqanmanta.
I was just so tired.	Chayllam ancha sayk’usqa karqani.

This is available here.	Kayqa kaypi tarikun.
There is no time today.	Kunan punchawqa manam tiempo kanchu.

Maybe I can do this.	Ichapas kayta ruwayta atiyman.
One year.	Huk wata.
Enormous.	Hatun hatun.
But be quick.	Ichaqa usqhaylla kay.
He never knew anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas yacharqanchu.
There is nothing he can do.	Chaypiqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
I don’t know how to do anything else.	Manam hukta ruwayta yachanichu.
It’s huge, actually.	Hatunmi, chiqaptaqa.
He said nothing was ever too much trouble.	Paymi nirqa mana imapas haykapipas llumpay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it won’t happen.	Mana chayqa manan kanqachu.
Perhaps he can find out.	Yaqapaschá chayta yachayta atinman.
One of them stayed with us for a while.	Hukninmi huk tiempo ñoqaykuwan qhepakurqan.
I sure want him to, you know.	Seguro munani chayta ruwananta, yachanki.
You will soon learn these things.	Chaykunataqa pisi tiempollamantan yachanki.

I never felt like I was ready.	Manam haykapipas listo hinachu tarikurqani.
He can’t believe that’s the case.	Payqa manan creeyta atinmanchu chhayna kasqanpi.
That will be easy.	Chayqa facilmi kanqa.
That would be really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanman.
So, was the next best thing.	Chaymi, karqan qatiqnin aswan allin kaq.
Perhaps he should do so.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanan.
He'd rather have them here.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman kaypi chaykunataqa.
It’s accordingly.	Chayman hinam.
How do they.	Imaynatataq paykunaqa.
I can’t say anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
Thank you, we are very happy.	Gracias, ancha kusisqam kachkaniku.

Don’t do that again.	Ama hukmanta chayta ruwaychu.

He knew what what it was.	Yacharqa ima ima kasqanmanta.
Makes a good evening meal.	Allin ch’isi mikhunata ruwan.
And that’s really hard.	Hinaspa chayqa chiqap sasa.
He did this for a year.	Chaytam huk wata ruwarqa.
You can’t go yet.	Manaraqmi riyta atiwaqchu.
It could be tonight.	Kunan tuta kanman.

Yes, you should do that.	Arí, chaytam ruwanayki.
I am not worth anything.	Ñoqaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He couldn't have known this was wrong.	Payqa manan yachayta atinmanchu karqan kayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
He was crazy.	Payqa loco kasqa.

This cannot be true.	Kayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman.
If you think it works for you, give it a try.	Sichus qanpaq allin kanman nispa yuyaykunki chayqa, huk kutilla ruway.

I wanted to reach that big.	Chay hatun chayayta munarqani.
So that’s a difficult thing.	Chaymi chayqa sasa.
I think we’ve done that.	Chayta ruwasqaykumanta yuyaykuni.
Like every human being.	Sapa runa hinam.
Two people were seriously injured.	Iskay runakunam sinchita k’irisqa karqanku.
I can't work.	Manam llamkayta atiymanchu.
Such a statement is always in the same context.	Chayna rimayqa sapa kutim chayna kasqanpi.
He gave it to me.	Paymi quwarqa.
He thought you should.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwanaykipaq.
It will do something funny.	Asikunapaq hina ima ruwanqa.
He still couldn't believe it.	Payqa manaraqmi creeyta atirqachu.
In the city at least.	Llaqtapi aswanpas.
I knew what he wanted to do.	Yacharqanim ima ruway munasqanmanta.
He won’t be ready.	Payqa manan listochu kanqa.
Yes, that means you.	Arí, chayqa qanmi niyta munan.
It doesn’t really sound like a difficult task.	Manam chiqaptaqa sasa ruway hinachu uyarikun.
Now there is something.	Kunanqa imapas kanmi.
But it may not work.	Ichaqa manapaschá allintachu ruwanman.
We don’t have a good sense of humor.	Manam allin yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
I haven’t done it before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanichu.
I did it a lot back then.	Chay tiempopiqa anchatam chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
But it is not an easy task.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chay ruwayqa.
Home again, now.	Wasiman yapamanta, kunan.
He wanted to understand now.	Payqa kunanmi entiendeyta munarqa.
If you want one.	Sichus hukta munanki chayqa.
Two or three dozen or so.	Iskay kimsa chunka hina.
That was before anything else.	Chayqa karqa imamantapas ñawpaqtaraqmi.
There he goes to school.	Chaypim payqa yachay wasiman rin.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Chaytaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
Not sure anything went wrong.	Mana segurochu imapas mana allinchu risqanmanta.
I don’t know why some people don’t like it.	Mana yachanichu imarayku wakin runakuna mana gustanchu.
I wasn’t sure who that person was.	Manam segurochu karqani chay runa pi kasqanmantaqa.
He said he felt set up.	Paymi nirqa churasqa hina sientekusqanmanta.
No, never quite, he says.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas allintachu, nispas nin.
There was action there.	Chaypi ruwaymi karqan.
This is a core function.	Kayqa huk uma ruwaymi.
And he thinks.	Hinaspa yuyaykun.
These are adults.	Kaykunaqa kuraq runakunam.
He was a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq wayna karqa.
But he probably doesn't want a solution.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana munanchu huk allichayta.
He died three hours later.	Kinsa hora qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Everything about him was difficult.	Paymanta tukuy imapas sasam karqa.
He was a little disappointed.	Payqa huk chhikantan hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
And then came the next day.	Hinaspa chaymanta hamurqan qhepa p’unchay.
Everyone knows this.	Kaytaqa llapallankum yachanku.
Maybe two things.	Ichapas iskay imakuna.
And this is interesting.	Hinaspa kayqa sumaqmi.
But it didn’t work out before.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa allinchu karqan.
At the right time.	Allin tiempopi.
I'll be with you later.	Qhepamanmi qanwan kuska kasaq.
I think he likes it.	Payqa gustanmi nispaymi piensani.
We cannot stop it now.	Kunanqa manam harkayta atichwanchu.
Today it was me.	Kunan punchawmi ñuqa karqani.
Tell me where he went.	Mayman risqanmanta willaway.
I can't find it now.	Mana kunan tariyta atinichu.
He couldn't have said that.	Manam chaytaqa niyta atinmanchu karqa.
That’s how he came here.	Chaynatam kayman hamurqa.
If you know a better way, go there.	Aswan allin ñanta yachanki chayqa, chayman riy.
That is not the case now.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
Two weeks later, no one did.	Iskay semana qhepamanmi mana pipas ruwarqanchu.
I couldn’t believe he would do that.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna ruwananta.
It was a wonderful event.	Ancha sumaq ruwaymi karqan.
Later, he did so.	Qhepamanmi chaytaqa ruwarqan.
In the same house.	Kikin wasipi.
I couldn’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikuyta atirqanichu.
I don’t mean to say.	Ama niyta munanichu.
Something that isn’t said.	Imapas mana nisqa.
I didn’t know what he was doing there.	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi ima ruwasqanmanta.
Some people are fine with it.	Wakin runakunaqa allinmi chaywanqa.
I would love to know how to do it.	Anchatan munani imayna ruwanayta yachayta.
I saw that immediately.	Chaytaqa chayllam rikurqani.
It was released today.	Kunan punchawmi lluqsirqa.
That is a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
That’s your thing.	Chayqa qampaq kaqmi.
That’s what he did last year.	Chaytan qayna wata ruwarqan.
This is a real chance.	Kayqa chiqap chansa.
This is what it is.	Kaymi ima.
It’s sad, but it’s the truth.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi.
But it should be pretty easy.	Ichaqa allin facilmi kanan.
Unfortunately, this type of behavior makes things worse.	Llakikuypaqmi kay laya ruwayqa aswan mana allinta ruwan.
It seems better that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi rikchakun.
It just wasn't safe.	Chaylla mana segurochu karqa.
We went everywhere together.	Kuska maypipas puriq kayku.
I don't know why this happened.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna pasasqanmantaqa.
I was there one evening.	Huk chisi chaypi karqani.
Having no idea why he was here or what he was supposed to do.	Mana ima yuyayniyuq kaspa imarayku kaypi kasqanmanta nitaq imata ruwananmanta.
But the name did.	Ichaqa sutinmi chaynata ruwarqa.
A lot, maybe.	Achka, ichapas.
And there he was.	Hinaspa chaypim payqa karqa.
Anything would be better than this.	Imapas kaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
So, it’s not that bad.	Chaymi, mana chayna mana allinchu.
It looked awfully good.	Manchay allinmi rikchakurqa.
Now this one.	Kunanqa kay huknin.
He couldn’t stand it anymore.	Manaña aguantayta atirqachu.
Still, that is what had to be done.	Chayna kaptinpas chaynatam ruwana karqa.
You can't quit now.	Kunanqa manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
He didn’t want the hurt to happen again.	Payqa manañan chay k’irisqa kananta munarqanchu.
He knew it was early, but he couldn’t wait any longer.	Payqa yacharqanmi temprano kashasqanmanta, ichaqa manañan suyayta atirqanchu.
So far, it makes no sense.	Kunankamaqa, mana imapaqpas valenchu.
And being black.	Chaymanta yana kay.
That’s, it’s not.	Chayqa, mana.
It does a good job.	Allinta ruwan.
Please join us!.	¡Ama hina kaspa, ñuqaykuwan kuska!.
The best one out there.	Chay hawapi aswan allin kaq.
I really have no idea what happened.	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu kani imachus pasasqanmanta.
Better hurry up.	Aswan allinmi kanman utqaylla.
If you are sick.	Sichus unqusqa kanki chayqa.
He told me that many times.	Payqa askha kutitan chayta niwarqan.
Soon everything in the world will be better.	Pisi tiempollamantan kay pachapi tukuy imapas allin kanman.
Ten years or more.	Chunka wata utaq aswan.
And he looked again.	Hinaspa yapamanta qhawarisqa.
I knew it wasn't what he wanted.	Yacharqanim mana munasqanman hina kasqanmanta.
All good with me.	Tukuy allin ñuqawan.
Time many people don't have.	Tiempo achka runakuna mana kanchu.
That went pretty fast.	Chayqa ancha utqayllam rirqa.
He has done this before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqan.
I knew where everything was, it was crazy.	Yacharqanim maypi tukuy imapas kasqanmanta, loco kasqa.
But I’m not quite sure how to do that.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatas chayta ruwasaq chayta.
In most cases, this is true.	Yaqa llapanpim chayqa chiqap.
Everything was so, so cold.	Tukuy imapas chayna, ancha chiri karqa.
You know like the future.	Hamuq pacha hina yachanki.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chaymantaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
I could have done another answer.	Huk kutichiyta ruwayman karqan.
But it never worked out.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
Not just that, anywhere.	Mana chayllachu, maypipas.
No one knew what was going to happen.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus pasananta.
We have been together for two years.	Iskay watañam kuska kachkaniku.
Then again, who knows.	Chaymanta yapamanta, pi yachan.
There was nothing else wrong.	Manam imapas huk mana allinchu karqa.
It’s not the next day.	Manam paqarin punchawchu.
Where is he anyway.	Maypitaq kachkan imayna kaptinpas.
Otherwise it looked great.	Mana chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
So that’s what he felt like.	Chaymi chayna tarikurqa.
I was very proud of that.	Chaymantam anchata orgulloso karqani.
Maybe I can help.	Ichapas yanapayta atiyman.
No, it’s not even.	Manan, manan nitaq.
They’re both there, both real.	Iskayninku chaypi kachkanku, iskayninku chiqap.
A second first.	Huk iskay kaq ñawpaqta.
It’s not safe.	Manam segurochu.
You think you want to see that.	Chayta rikuyta munasqaykita yuyanki.
And actually, it made real sense.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, chiqap yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Now this would be wrong.	Kunanqa kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
But this isn’t the case, man.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu, runa.
I hope he doesn’t.	Suyachkani mana chayta ruwananta.
This is going to go well.	Kayqa allintam rinqa.
Tell me more about it.	Astawan willaway.
This shouldn’t be a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanan.
I knew he was in trouble.	Yacharqanim sasachakuypi kasqanmanta.
They both know it’s not that easy.	Iskayninku yachanku mana chay hina facilchu kasqanmanta.
However, it is still there.	Ichaqa, hinallam kachkan.
Insurance.	Seguro.
I don't want to buy a second house.	Manañam iskay kaq wasi rantiyta munanichu.
That’s what we did lately.	Chaytan ruwarqayku qhepa tiempopi.
Know what the weather will do.	Tiempo ima ruwananta yachay.
And everywhere else.	Hinaspa maypipas.
He obviously doesn’t want to see it.	Sut’inmi mana rikuyta munanchu.
I feel a lot better.	Allintam aswan allinta sientekuni.
To make an adjustment.	Huk allichayta ruwanapaq.
I’m glad it didn’t work out.	Kusikuni mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
I don’t know where to go.	Manam yachanichu mayman rinaypaq.
Clearly this is not the case.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan chay hinachu.
And he went there.	Hinaspa chayman rirqa.
He was great, but not good enough.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqan, ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
That’s pretty crazy.	Chayqa ancha loco.
So he went from there.	Chaymi chaymanta rirqa.
No, it wasn’t good.	Manan, manan allinchu karqan.
I didn’t listen either.	Ñoqapas manan uyarirqanichu.
He didn't know what that might be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus chay kanman chayta.
I want to be married.	Casarasqa kaytam munani.
And that again twice.	Hinaspa chayta yapamanta iskay kutita.
If so, it will happen very quickly.	Chayna kaptinqa ancha utqayllam kanqa.
This one, alone.	Kay huk, sapallan.
He could not say these things.	Chaykunataqa manam rimayta atirqachu.
If not, something is wrong.	Mana chayna kaptinqa, imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
Good as new.	Musuq hina allin.
It felt disappointing.	Chayqa hukmanyasqa hinam tarikurqa.
All the while.	Tukuy chay pacha.
That doesn’t work well.	Chayqa manan allintachu ruwan.
Now he couldn't do anything right.	Kunanqa manañam imatapas allinta ruwayta atirqachu.
So he did it all over again.	Chaymi tukuy imatapas hukmanta ruwarqa.
He decided to drive.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi carropi rinanpaq.
You know this, you know.	Kaytaqa yachanki.
Everyone was bad.	Lliwmi mana allin karqaku.
That wasn’t really for you.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu qanpaq karqan.
I did my best that day.	Chay punchawmi tukuy atisqayta ruwarqani.
I really don’t know what else to say about that.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu imatataq chaymanta astawan niyta.
I don't understand what happened.	Manam entiendenichu ima pasasqanmanta.
I don’t plan on going out tonight.	Manam kunan tuta lluqsiyta yuyaykunichu.
That would be a tragedy.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi kanman.
This was not going to be easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu kanan karqa.
I’m sure he wants you to be happy.	Seguro kani kusisqa kanaykita munasqanmanta.
It doesn’t get any worse than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan mana allinchu.
Someone gave it to me.	Pipas quwarqa.
But the truth is bigger.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi aswan hatun.
This will do it.	Kayqa ruwanqa.
I would love to see her happy.	Anchatam munani kusisqa qawayta.
But you never knew.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqankichu.
But the truth was, they were good.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi karqan, paykunaqa allinmi karqanku.
And no one to help.	Hinaspa mana pipas yanapananpaq.
It’s a difference, you know.	Huk chikan kaymi, yachanki.
I’m the one who did it.	Ñuqam chaytaqa ruwarqani.
But I did it a long time ago.	Ichaqa unayñan chayta ruwarqani.
Nothing that big.	Mana imapas chay hatun.
Ten.	Chunka.
But so far nothing has worked out.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan imapas allinchu.
He can do this.	Payqa kaytan ruwayta atin.
He's proud of it.	Payqa chaymantam orgulloso kachkan.
Always, always, someone else was there.	Sapa kuti, sapa kuti, huk runa chaypi karqa.
He couldn't have said anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta atinmanchu karqan.
I’m here every night.	Sapa tutam kaypi kachkani.
Some good ideas.	Wakin allin yuyayniyuq.
But it just happened.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi chayna pasarqa.
I didn’t see it and.	Manam rikurqanichu hinaspa.
It’s nice to do it once though.	Sumaqmi huk kutilla ruway ichaqa.
I had no idea you were in town.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani llaqtapi kasqaykita.
These things will have to be done.	Chaykunataqa ruwana kanqa.
He knew the story.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay willakuyta.
But it’s never enough.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayllachu.
Who knows though.	Pi yachan ichaqa.
We did that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwarqayku.
He is as good as anyone.	Payqa pimanpas hina allinmi.
I really don’t know what to do now.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu kunan imata ruwanayta.
Who knows, it might be.	Pi yachan, chayna kanman.
I did, and I do.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, ruwani ima.
It was a cold day.	Huk chiri punchawmi karqa.
This failure was frequent.	Chay mana ruwayqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
But this one will take longer.	Ichaqa kaymi aswan unayta kanqa.
That’s stupidity.	Chayqa sonso kaymi.
Very good sense of humor.	Ancha allin yuyayniyuq.
Nothing is ever that simple.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu kanman.
I was with him every day.	Sapa punchawmi paywan karqani.
I was very happy with what we did.	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani ima ruwasqaykumanta.
So, please .	Chaymi, ama hina kaspa .
But that’s what he had to do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanan karqan.
Very much indeed.	Ancha achka chiqap.
So much of the time.	Chayna achka tiempo.
This is a bad night.	Kayqa mana allin tutam.
It was fairly easy to do.	Chay ruwayqa allin facilmi karqa.
That kind of just happened.	Chayqa huk laya chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
I want to know why.	Imaraykutaq chayta yachayta munani.
That means they are serious people.	Chayqa niyta munan serio runakuna kasqankuta.
Yes, it probably is.	Arí, yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
He would be good alone.	Payqa sapallanmi allin kanman.
He doesn’t care now.	Payqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
So there it was, the future.	Chaymi chaypi karqan, hamuq pacha.
It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
He wasn’t so sure.	Payqa manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.
He never said that.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa nirqanchu.
Nice, that’s nice.	Sumaq, chayqa sumaqmi.
But here is the best part.	Ichaqa kaypim aswan allin kaq kachkan.
He really, really wanted to win.	Payqa chiqaptam, chiqaptam atipayta munarqa.
Now I am sorry now.	Kunanqa kunanmi llakikuni.
That would have been the worst of all.	Chayqa tukuy imamantapas aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
He keeps going.	Payqa hinallam rin.
For the first time, anywhere in the world.	Ñawpaq kutita, maypipas kay pachapi.
He had no choice, what would happen to him.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, imachus paywan pasananta.
But the man said nothing.	Ichaqa chay runaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
I’m really very sorry.	Chiqamanta anchata llakikuni.
He can’t do this again.	Payqa manan hukmanta kayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
I never thought you would.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayta ruwanaykipaqqa.
Why why why why.	Imarayku imarayku imarayku.
I don’t know how to do it.	Manam yachanichu imayna ruwayta.
He knows how to solve every problem.	Payqa yachanmi sapa sasachakuy allichayta.
I listened, I listened.	Uyarirqanim, uyarirqanim.
He didn’t know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
What is this like.	Imaynataq kayqa.
I want to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwayta munani.
He certainly knew what he was thinking.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yacharqan ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
There isn’t, actually.	Manam kanchu, chiqaptaqa.
I thought everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Know this as a fact.	Kayta yachay huk chiqap kaqta hina.
Not that that would happen.	Mana chay pasananta.
Repeatedly saying.	Yapamanta nispa.
But no one really knows everything.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu tukuy imatapas yachan.
That would be unrealistic.	Chayqa mana cheqaqchu kanman.
That's not too bad.	Chayqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
It actually looks like it used to.	Chiqaptaqa ñawpaq hinam rikchakun.
Here, no one is.	Kaypi, mana pipas.
It was certainly more interesting.	Chiqamanta aswan sumaq karqa.
Very soon now, someone will.	Ancha pisi tiempollamantan kunanqa, pipas ruwanqa.
I wonder if you were happy and if you are happy now.	Tapukuni, kusisqachu karqanki, kunan kusisqachu kanki.
I really need to do this.	Chiqamanta kayta ruwanaypaq necesitasaq.
Yes,’ he says.	Arí,’ nispas nin.
There was no set time.	Manam churasqa hora karqachu.
I don't want to do that again.	Manañam hukmanta chayta ruwayta munanichu.
I heard this one.	Kayta uyarirqani.
He said it as a challenge.	Chaytaqa huk sasachakuy hinam nirqa.
That’s a thing with me.	Chayqa ñuqawanqa imapas.
He did nothing to make her leave.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu ripunanpaq.
That’s it, he said.	Chayqa, nispa.
And there you are.	Hinaspa chaypiqa kanki.
He thought it was funny.	Asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
He has many ideas.	Payqa achka yuyayniyuqmi.
Very soon I found out what that thing was.	Ancha pisi tiempollamantan yacharqani imachus chay imapas kasqanmanta.
I mean, really.	Niyta munani, chiqaptapuni.
I really don’t want to.	Chiqaptaqa manam munanichu.
I don’t know if it’s right or not.	Manam yachanichu allinchu icha manachu chayta.
Nothing much happened.	Manam imapas anchatachu pasarqa.
Being that person.	Chay runa kay.
Happy, but scared.	Kusisqa, ichaqa mancharisqa.
Maybe nothing at all.	Ichapas mana imapas.
That’s a very good thing to say.	Chayqa ancha allin nisqa.
I'll be in a hurry.	Utqaylla kasaq.
I said early on that this year, this is it.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi nirqani kay wata, kaymi.
I can get home.	Wasiyman chayayta atiyman.
Two days to go.	Iskay punchawmi rinanpaq.
It doesn’t look right.	Manam allintachu rikchakun.
That day passed.	Chay punchawmi pasarqa.
If you don’t know, say so.	Mana yachankichu chayqa, niy.
It was such a time.	Chay hina tiempon karqan.
I said yes to it.	Arí nispaymi nirqani.
He did not come to the house long.	Mana unaytachu chay wasiman hamurqa.
It’s not very useful for anything.	Manam ancha allinchu imapaqpas.
But tell me something else.	Ichaqa hukta willaway.
We’re pretty good, but we’re not good enough.	Allin allinmi kayku, ichaqa manan allinchu kayku.
We can't say for sure right now.	Kunanqa manam chiqaptaqa rimayta atichwanchu.
That’s the crowd.	Chayqa chay achka runakuna.
Not so easy when drunk.	Mana chayna facilchu machasqa kaptinqa.
It’s harder to do that now.	Aswan sasa chayta ruway kunan.
I was curious about it.	Chaywanmi yachayta munarqani.
A few months ago.	Iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqta.
But then we are better now.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa kunanmi aswan allin kayku.
That’s why you did it.	Chayraykum chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
I never wanted to play with him.	Manam haykapipas paywan pukllayta munarqanichu.
But there is one.	Ichaqa kanmi huk.
Anyway, someone did it.	Imayna kaptinpas, pipas ruwarqa.
You are .	Qam kanki .
He knows how to eat.	Payqa mikhunata yachan.
I made them a while ago.	Chaykunataqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqani.
Anyway, maybe that's what this was about.	Imayna kaptinpas, ichapas chaymanta kayqa karqa.
Everything is very .	Tukuy imapas ancha .
He left a few hours ago.	Payqa iskay kinsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi ripurqan.
I didn’t know what to make of him either.	Ñoqapas manan yacharqanichu paymanta imatachus ruwanayta.
He’s not alone out there.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chay hawapi.
I like that one.	Chaytaqa gustan.
I hardly see anything.	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikunichu.
I want to eat this food.	Kay mikhunata mikhuyta munani.
He did what he could.	Payqa atisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
But he never did anything about it.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas ruwarqanchu.
He learned everything there.	Chaypi tukuy imata yacharqa.
There was a girl who was really big.	Huk sipasmi kasqa, chaymi chiqap hatun karqa.
Don't ever do that.	Ama hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwaychu.
? 	?
Do something else.	Huk ruwayta ruway.
He knows you’re not up to it.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayman hinachu kasqaykita.
It had been quite a long time.	Allin unayñan karqan.
But what was it like that.	Ichaqa imataq karqan chay hina.
No one knew who had done it.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu pichus chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I don’t think you’re right.	Mana allinchu kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
And that’s what it was.	Hinaspa chayna kasqa.
It just seemed like the thing to do.	Chayqa ruwanapaq hinallam rikchakurqa.
But to be there.	Ichaqa chaypi kananpaq.
All easy going people.	Tukuy facil puriq runakuna.
He certainly wouldn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta ruwanmanchu.
Surely he has better things to do.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa aswan allin ruwaykunata ruwanan.
Maybe it’s not that good.	Ichapas mana chayna allinchu.
He never wanted to, really.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas munarqanchu, cheqaqtapuni.
But it’s hard, boy.	Ichaqa sasam, wayna.
Don’t do it!.	¡Ama ruwaychu!.
He was so beautiful, so great.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa, ancha hatunmi karqa.
You will do worse.	Aswan mana allintam ruwanki.
They know exactly what is going on.	Paykunaqa allintan yachanku imachus pasashasqanmanta.
He certainly knew the truth, if anyone knew it.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa cheqaq kaqta yacharqan, sichus pipas yacharqan chayqa.
Not here, not there.	Mana kaypichu, nitaq chaypichu.
We need to repeat the game.	Pukllayta yapamanta ruwananchik tiyan.
It’s not the best.	Manan aswan allinchu.
Not sure why, but it was quick.	Mana segurochu imarayku, ichaqa usqhayllan karqan.
I didn’t go anywhere.	Manam maymanpas rirqanichu.
I feel comfortable here.	Kaypiqa allintam tarikuni.
I couldn’t ask him.	Manam tapuyta atirqanichu.
I am sure of that now.	Chaymantaqa kunanqa segurom kachkani.
The best thing to do is to do that.	Aswan allinqa chay ruwaymi.
You want it to be yours.	Munanki qampaq kananta.
But it would be nice.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman.
He obviously wasn’t.	Payqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
And that’s a bit of time.	Hinaspa chayqa huk chikan tiempo.
So, thank you.	Chaymi, gracias.
I’m such a mean girl.	Chayna millay sipasmi kani.
This is not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facil ruwaychu.
they don’t know exactly where they are, not yet.	mana allintachu yachanku maypi kasqankuta, manaraqmi.
I would like you to come too.	Munaymanmi qampas hamuyta.
He was extremely happy with her.	Payqa sinchitan kusisqa kasharqan paywan.
He’s tired, hungry, alone.	Payqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa, sapallan.
These are available.	Chaykunataqa kanmi.
It’s best to do the hard part first.	Aswan allinmi kanman sasa kaqta ñawpaqta ruway.
Now .	Kunan .
No one, he said.	Mana pipas, nispa.
I couldn’t do it that day.	Chay punchawqa manam atirqanichu.
I don’t know him.	Manam riqsinichu.
There was nothing worse.	Manam imapas aswan mana allinqa karqachu.
These people were all in the past.	Chay runakunaqa llapallankum ñawpaqpi karqaku.
But not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypiqa.
He was home the day before.	Ñawpaq p’unchaymi wasinpi kasharqan.
That person would be good.	Chay runaqa allinmi kanman.
I want to do it.	Ruwayta munani.
Very, very ugly.	Ancha ancha millay.
I think that’s what he did.	Yuyaykuni chay ruwasqanmanta.
I never heard from him again.	Manañam haykapipas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
So it’s the biggest.	Chaymi aswan hatun.
We disagree on whether that is wrong or not.	Chayqa mana allinchu icha manachu chaymantaqa manam acuerdopichu kayku.
He was a pipeline.	Payqa pipas kasqa.
He really doesn’t like it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana gustanchu.
I still want to fix it.	Chaytaqa hinallam allichayta munani.
Why would that be the case?	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanman.
Unfortunately, this is where it went.	Llakikuypaqmi kayman rirqa.
That you’re here.	Chay kaypi kasqaykita.
And it will be.	Hinaspa kanqa.
Maybe that would have happened next.	Ichapas chaymantaqa chayna kanman karqa.
This guy is a human being.	Kay runaqa runam.
I’m going to talk to him now.	Kunanqa paywan rimaq risaq.
I never want to see her again.	Manam haykapipas hukmanta rikuyta munanichu.
There's a big crowd.	Hatun achka runakunam kachkan.
I hadn’t seen him before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan paytaqa rikurqanichu.
It didn’t really matter until now.	Kunankamaqa manan cheqaqtachu importante karqan.
He has to do a lot.	Achkatam ruwanan.
I can't stand it now.	Kunanqa manam aguantayta atinichu.
But he was probably the last.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá payqa qhepa kaq karqan.
That’s what we used to do in the past. 	Chayqa ñawpaqpi puriq kayku. 
Nothing is right.	Manam imapas allinchu.
It won’t be that way.	Manan chay hinaqa kanqachu.
It was good though.	Allinmi karqan ichaqa.
There is nothing he can do.	Mana ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
That’s pretty much it actually.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chiqaptaqa.
I still don't know how to fix this problem.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu kay sasachakuy allichayta.
Now that could have been anything.	Kunanqa chayqa imapas kanman karqan.
I have just decided to do something else.	Chayraqmi hukta ruwanaypaq tantearuni.
He didn’t want to hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu munarqan.
And for him.	Hinaspa paypaq.
This talk was very good.	Kay rimayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
If you do, you do.	Sichus ruwanki chayqa, ruwanki.
I was very much like that.	Anchatam chayna karqani.
Now, this isn’t everyone, of course.	Kunanqa, kayqa manan llapa runachu, sut’inmi.
Another difference this time.	Huk chikan kay kutipi.
I don’t agree with that.	Manam chaywanqa acuerdopichu kani.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, mana.
The lonely traveler.	Sapallan puriq.
He wasn't sure why, but he knew.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
You know, it’s very intense.	Yachanki, ancha sinchi.
Go quickly, please.	Usqhaylla riy, ama hina kaspa.
She couldn't remember the last time she felt so happy.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu qhepa kutipi chhayna kusisqa sientekusqanmanta.
He couldn't buy it.	Payqa manam rantiyta atirqachu.
It wasn’t really him.	Manam chiqaptachu pay karqa.
That will be the reality.	Chayqa kanqa chiqap kaqmi.
You think this would be easy.	Qamqa yuyanki kayqa facilmi kanman.
This is like this is like this.	Kay hina kay hina.
Perhaps the worst part.	Ichapas aswan mana allinqa.
But he is doing well.	Ichaqa allintam ruwachkan.
The bad me is me all the time.	Mana allin ñuqaqa ñuqam tukuy tiempo.
They are actually very nice people.	Paykunaqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaq runakunam kanku.
It wouldn’t be very easy.	Manan ancha facilchu kanman.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.	Gracias, gracias, gracias.
And it came out great.	Hinaspa hatun lluqsirqa.
Today he did just that.	Kunan punchawmi chaynata ruwarqa.
And before that.	Hinaspa manaraq chaymanta.
But he couldn’t go.	Ichaqa manan riyta atirqanchu.
But this time do two things.	Ichaqa kay kutipi iskay ruwaykunata ruway.
He's been through a lot.	Payqa achkatam pasarqa.
I never thought of this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa piensarqanichu.
Now, it won’t be.	Kunanqa, manan kanqachu.
He wanted to be outside.	Payqa hawapi kaytam munarqa.
Still bad though.	Hinallam mana allin ichaqa.
I could never speak properly.	Manam haykapipas allinta rimayta atirqanichu.
Someone but me.	Pipas mana ñuqachu.
That shouldn’t be true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanan.
He didn’t think straight.	Payqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqan.
I’m not going to go easy.	Manam facilchu risaq.
That’s what he could do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta atinman karqan.
Which is so nice about you.	Imataq ancha sumaq qammanta.
But that will take time.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa tiempon kanqa.
I can’t do it at all.	Manam imapipas ruwaymanchu.
It was good here.	Kaypiqa allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t what he wanted.	Manam munasqanman hinachu karqa.
Probably mistaken about him.	Yaqapaschá paymanta pantasqa.
It was very, very good.	Ancha, ancha allinmi karqa.
But it would be very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
Is this a good idea? 	¿Allinchu kanman kayqa?
It will be a good thing for you.	Allin ruwaymi kanqa qanpaq.
He never wanted to do that again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
So he probably did the right thing.	Chaymi yaqapaschá allin kaqta ruwarqa.
It really should be.	Chiqamanta kanan tiyan.
He thinks this is a good thing.	Payqa piensanmi kayqa allin kananpaq.
It should be a nice afternoon!.	¡Sumaq tarde kanan!.
John wasn’t there.	Juanqa manam chaypichu karqa.
Actually he was.	Chiqaptaqa payqa karqa.
He seemed very disappointed.	Payqa ancha hukmanyasqa hinam karqa.
That was not the case at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas chay hinachu karqan.
I don't feel safe here anymore.	Kaypiqa manañam segurochu tarikuni.
You’re a mentally ill person.	Qamqa yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I said maybe.	nispaymi nirqani ichapas.
He gets better and better.	Payqa aswan allintan aswan allinta ruwan.
It looks really sad now.	Kunanqa chiqap llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
He wanted to know why.	Payqa imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
A good set up.	Huk allin churasqa.
It was a really hard time for me.	Chiqamanta sasa tiempo karqa ñuqapaq.
Maybe this was it.	Ichapas kaymi karqa.
Most things look ridiculous.	Yaqa llapan imapas asikunapaq hinam rikchakun.
I thought it was better.	Aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
Not real food.	Mana chiqap mikhuy.
But that is no longer true.	Ichaqa manañan chayqa cheqaqchu.
It came out pretty easy.	Chayqa lluqsirqa ancha facilmi.
Two more than enough.	Iskay aswan achka.
It was supposed to be here.	Kaypi kanan karqa.
You can’t leave that out.	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
He hasn’t been like that all summer.	Payqa manan chay hinachu tukuy verano.
Go ahead, do it.	Riy, ruway.
If you don’t, who will?.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, ¿pitaq ruwanqa?.
Said he couldn't get out of there fast enough.	Nisqa mana chaymanta utqaylla lluqsiyta atisqanmanta.
All, all too soon.	Tukuy, tukuy ancha utqaylla.
I almost did that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqani.
It's a difficult time.	Sasa pacha.
That was me, now.	Chayqa ñuqam karqani, kunanqa.
But, it wasn’t fast enough.	Ichaqa, manan usqhayllachu karqan.
I really doubt it.	Chiqaptam iskayrayani.
So many people were injured.	Chaymi askha runakuna k’irisqa karqanku.
He was a very serious minded man.	Payqa ancha serio yuyayniyuq runam karqa.
Who are we?	Pikuna kanchik.
The nature of the problem.	Sasachakuy imayna kasqanmanta.
I didn’t know how to play before now.	Manaraq kunan pukllayta yacharqani.
Tonight is the worst.	Kunan tutaqa aswan mana allinmi.
You can’t go to the gym.	Manan riyta atiwaqchu.
I feel uncomfortable with it.	Chaywanmi mana allintachu sientekuni.
It was very clear.	Ancha sut'inmi karqan.
Yes, there it is.	Arí, chaypi.
It was there indeed.	Chaypim chiqaptapuni karqa.
Sure enough not.	Seguro mana.
He opened them up.	Chaykunataqa kicharirqa.
She seems like a nice girl.	Payqa sumaq sipasmi rikchakun.
They both lived together.	Iskayninku kuska tiyaq.
It’s going to be a nice thing.	Sumaq imapas kanqa.
This is kind of a tough one.	Kayqa huk laya sinchi kaqmi.
It will be good again.	Yapamanta allinmi kanqa.
He doesn’t want to play outside.	Payqa manan hawapi pukllayta munanchu.
Here's a chance.	Kaypi huk chansa kachkan.
I don't remember why.	Manañam yuyarinichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
And that’s all that means.	Hinaspa chaylla chaylla niyta munan.
He was a man like himself.	Pay hina runam karqa.
No, no, that’s a good thing.	Manan, manan, chayqa allinmi.
We have actually been here for almost a year.	Chiqaptaqa yaqa huk watañam kaypi kachkaniku.
So, however, it was.	Chaymi ichaqa karqan.
That sounds crazy.	Chayqa loco hinam uyarikun.
I was very proud of that.	Chaywanmi anchata orgulloso karqani.
If this sounds like you, you’re welcome.	Sichus kay qan hina uyarikun chayqa, allinmi kashanki.
And so did I.	Hinaspa ñuqapas.
He seems to get drunk fast.	Payqa utqaylla machasqa hinam kachkan.
So people looked like that.	Chaymi runakunaqa chayna rikchayniyuq karqaku.
In fact, it actually exists.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin kashan.
It would be a horrible thing to do.	Millay ruwaymi kanman.
Why should that be easy?.	¿Imanasqataq chayqa facil kanan?.
Man, that was a hard day.	Runa, chayqa sasa punchawmi karqa.
He has some ideas.	Payqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi.
People were horrified that he did something like this.	Runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku kay hina ruwasqanmanta.
Being an adult is not difficult.	Kuraq runa kayqa manam sasachu.
That would certainly be too much.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin nishuta kanman.
Being something yourself.	Kikin imapas kay.
That was yesterday.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
Sure, he wanted to be friends with her.	Seguro, payqa munarqanmi paywan amigontin kayta.
Nothing means much anymore.	Manaña imapas anchatachu niyta munan.
I know I did mine.	Yachanim ñuqapa ruwasqayta.
Now it’s not so good.	Kunanqa manan chay hina allinchu.
If something goes wrong, let me know.	Imapas mana allin kaptinqa willaway.
He was furious now.	Kunanqa sinchita phiñasqa kasqa.
That wouldn’t be too difficult.	Chayqa manan ancha sasachu kanman.
He was fired later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepamanmi qarqosqa karqan.
I was really a new person with him.	Chiqaptam paywan musuq runa karqani.
Time again yesterday.	Qayna punchaw yapamanta pacha.
About ten hours.	Chunka hora hina.
What does it look like?.	¿Imaynataq rikchakun?.
Outside of that.	Chay hawapi.
He's always real, always serious, always tough.	Payqa sapa kutim chiqap, sapa kuti serio, sapa kuti sinchi.
Such an approach is unique.	Chayna ruwayqa sapallanmi.
He’s a unique, talented player.	Payqa sapallan, yachaysapa pukllaqmi.
It should be done in advance.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ruwana.
I think he is funny.	Payqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensani.
Anyway, he's right.	Imayna kaptinpas, payqa chiqaptam nin.
I have seen this over and over again.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim rikurqani.
This is a quick process.	Kayqa utqaylla ruwaymi.
Actually, that happened pretty fast.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
Yes, he is amazing.	Arí, payqa admirakuypaqmi.
But he was afraid.	Ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
He thought things would work out.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imapas allin kananta.
That it is a beauty.	Sumaq kay kasqanmanta.
He's doing something.	Imatapas ruwachkan.
Anyone have an interesting idea, please.	Pipas huk sumaq yuyayniyuq, ama hina kaspa.
You learn faster.	Aswan utqayllam yachanki.
But it’s good for him.	Ichaqa allinmi paypaq.
Important person.	Importante runa.
You want to do the right thing for him.	Paypaq allinta ruwayta munanki.
To have him there.	Payta chaypi kananpaq.
If there is a sequel.	Sichus qatiqnin kanman chayqa.
She’s such a serious girl.	Payqa chayna serio sipasmi.
There’s nothing wrong with me.	Manam imapas ñuqawanqa kanchu.
I probably knew that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa yacharqani.
I can't do that again.	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atiymanchu.
It’s not the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu.
But he wasn't that childlike.	Ichaqa manan chay hina wawa hinachu karqan.
We have done all this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa tukuy kaytam ruwarqayku.
But you are, well .	Ichaqa qanmi, allinmi .
And then he did something.	Hinaspa chaymanta imatapas ruwarqa.
I hope you did.	Suyachkani chayta ruwasqaykita.
I am very happy.	Sinchi kusisqam kachkani.
There was a time.	Huk tiempon karqan.
He had to go now.	Payqa kunanmi rinan karqa.
Not everyone is like that.	Manan llapa runachu chhayna kanku.
That's how things happened.	Chaynatam imapas pasasqanmanta.
And work she did!.	Hinaspa llamkayta payqa ruwarqa!.
Maybe it wasn't that bad what he did to me.	Ichapas mana chayna mana allinchu karqa ñuqawan ruwasqanqa.
He speaks strongly.	Payqa sinchitan riman.
It’s not a good idea to do that.	Mana allinchu chayta ruwanapaq.
I had no intention of doing that.	Manam chayta ruwaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
This morning.	Kunan paqarin.
I can’t speak now.	Manam kunanqa rimayta atiymanchu.
The process will be immediate.	Chay ruwayqa chaylla kanqa.
If you are innocent, you can do that.	Mana huchayoq kanki chayqa, chaytan ruwawaq.
He may be alone.	Sapallanmi kanman.
She is a happy girl.	Payqa kusisqa sipasmi.
Maybe they know everything about you.	Ichapas qammanta tukuy imata yachanku.
So don’t do that.	Chaymi ama chayta ruwaychu.
Not like that, at least.	Mana chay hinachu, aswanpas.
We can’t see it.	Manam qawayta atichwanchu.
Said he wasn’t feeling all that good.	Nisqa mana chay tukuy allintachu sientekusqanmanta.
But he doesn’t think it’s funny.	Ichaqa manan asikunapaq hinachu kasqanpi yuyaykun.
So they’re here.	Chaymi paykunaqa kaypi kachkanku.
That's not a big deal.	Chayqa manam hatun ruwaychu.
What he was supposed to do.	Ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
He always refuses.	Payqa sapa kutim mana munanchu.
It was a very day.	Ancha punchawmi karqa.
People were crazy.	Runakunaqa loco karqanku.
I feel uncomfortable all the time.	Tukuy tiempon mana allintachu sientekuni.
But he still felt very depressed.	Ichaqa hinallam llumpay llakisqa tarikurqa.
He's kind of a stranger.	Payqa huk laya mana riqsisqa runam.
He’s just that.	Payqa chayraqmi.
I'll do another one but I don't know when.	Hukta ruwasaq ichaqa manan yachanichu hayk'aqmi.
Not doing is not doing.	Mana ruwayqa manam ruwaychu.
If it is the case.	Sichus chayna kaptinqa.
And then everything was finally ready.	Hinaspa chaymanta tukuy imapas tukukuypi listoña kasqa.
Now, and don't.	Kunanqa, hinaspa ama.
The truth can be ugly.	Cheqaq kaqmi millay kanman.
I think that is a real thing.	Chayqa chiqap imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
Can you fix that?.	¿Atiwaqchu chayta allichayta?.
It had to be all or nothing.	Lliwmi kanan karqa utaq mana imapas kanan karqa.
He was hurt real bad.	Payqa k’irisqa karqan cheqaq millay.
Nothing was certain there.	Chaypiqa manam imapas segurochu karqa.
A little man sad.	Huk pisi runa llakisqa.
They were all great.	Llapallankum hatun karqaku.
It’s not going to be a big deal.	Manam hatun ruwaychu kanqa.
But there was a man there.	Ichaqa huk runam chaypi kachkarqa.
But something was terribly, terribly wrong.	Ichaqa imapas manchay, manchay mana allinchu kasqa.
But it’s okay, probably.	Ichaqa allinmi kashan, yaqapaschá.
He was much happier.	Payqa aswan kusisqam karqa.
It’s who you really are.	Chayqa pichus cheqaqtapuni kanki.
I want to do it all.	Tukuy chayta ruwayta munani.
But this night was great.	Ichaqa kay tutaqa ancha allinmi karqan.
He did so quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan chayta ruwarqan.
I mean, that's almost a stranger.	Chayqa yaqa mana riqsisqa runa kasqanmantam niyta munani.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa manachá allinchu kanman.
He can do much better than that.	Payqa chaymantaqa aswan allintam ruwayta atin.
He’s terribly tall.	Payqa manchay hatunmi.
That cold, that terrible cold.	Chay chiri, chay manchay chiri.
They are with me.	Paykunaqa ñoqawanmi kashanku.
Everyone is sad and worried.	Lliwmi llakisqa, llakisqa ima kanku.
Now, however, there was no time.	Kunanmi ichaqa manaña tiempo karqanchu.
Here, there was nothing.	Kaypiqa, manam imapas karqachu.
This was the man.	Kay runam karqa.
I take that very seriously.	Chaytaqa anchatam serio kani.
Like the people.	Runakuna hina.
I saw him yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi payta rikurqani.
That's probably the easiest way.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan facil kanman.
And the next one.	Hinaspa hamuq.
He is not doing so well.	Payqa manam chayna allintachu ruwachkan.
The man is doing well.	Chay runaqa allintam ruwachkan.
But he could hear nothing.	Ichaqa manan imatapas uyariyta atirqanchu.
So he spent a lot of time alone.	Chayraykum payqa achka tiempota sapallan pasarqa.
But I want to.	Ichaqa munani.
But what happened next is a mystery.	Ichaqa chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan pipas yachanchu.
But, this needs a lot more work.	Ichaqa, kayqa aswan achka llamk’ayta necesitan.
He probably didn't do that.	Payqa manapaschá chaytachu ruwarqan.
I still saw him.	Paytaqa hinallam rikurqani.
Maybe two, three times a month.	Ichapas iskay kuti, kimsa kuti killapi.
And he was happy.	Hinaspa kusisqa karqan.
And, he knew he had to do it soon.	Hinaspa, payqa yacharqanmi usqhaylla ruwananta.
But after this, nothing is too difficult.	Ichaqa kay qhepamanmi mana imapas nishuta sasachu.
It’s nice to be together.	Kuska kayqa sumaqmi.
So, he’s the one.	Chaymi, payqa.
I didn’t want to see him.	Manam payta qawayta munarqanichu.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I'm afraid that way, almost.	Chaynatam manchakuni, yaqa.
He was usually right.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim allinta rimaq.
Sad and depressed.	Llakisqa hinaspa llakisqa.
I can’t bear to do it.	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu ruwayta.
I can't understand that.	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atiymanchu.
Two fronts, two backs.	Iskay ñawpaq, iskay qhipa.
Nothing is more certain.	Manan imapas aswan segurochu.
In the process of doing.	Ruway ruwaypi.
You have to do something, and do something else.	Imatapas ruwanayki, hinaspa huk ruwayta ruwanayki.
He thought about it but refused.	Chaypin yuyaykurqan ichaqa mana munarqanchu.
That was thirty years ago.	Chayqa kimsa chunka watañam karqa.
Maybe, something else.	Ichapas, huk imapas.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa chaylla.
I thought it was good.	Allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Doesn’t it matter.	¿Imananpaschu.
But now he was himself again.	Kunanmi ichaqa yapamanta pay kikin kasqa.
I hope this is not the case.	Suyachkani kayqa mana chayna kananpaq.
It’s never been like this before.	Mana hayk’aqpas kay hinachu karqan.
People are .	Runakunaqa .
Scared for some reason.	Imaraykupas mancharisqa.
The first one was the hardest.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan sasa karqa.
This year makes no sense.	Kay wata mana imapaqpas valenchu.
If not the first time.	Mana ñawpaq kutipi kaptinqa.
Disapproved or approved.	Mana allinpaq qhawarisqa utaq allinpaq qhawarisqa.
I'm pretty good now, thank you.	Kunanqa allin allinmi kachkani, gracias.
Maybe, you know how to do this.	Ichapas, kayta ruwayta yachanki.
I think that would be interesting.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
It should be unnamed.	Mana sutiyuq kanan.
That will never happen.	Chayqa manam haykapipas kanqachu.
Two, at least.	Iskay, aswanpas.
Now you know everything about me.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachanki ñuqamanta.
Unless they know what it is.	Manachus yachanku imachus kasqanmanta.
This is where you want to be.	Kaypim maypi kayta munanki.
I obviously didn’t.	Ñuqaqa sut’inmi mana ruwarqanichu.
However, the latter is incorrect.	Ichaqa, qhipa kaq nisqanqa mana allinchu.
Be in the present tense.	Kunan pachapi kay.
I know you want to.	Yachanim munasqaykita.
There was never a reason.	Manam haykapipas imaraykupas karqachu.
He wants everything faster and faster.	Payqa munan tukuy imatapas aswan utqaylla aswan utqaylla.
I didn’t see it right away.	Manam chayllachu rikurqani.
I think that's about right.	Chayqa yaqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
That’s really all he said.	Cheqaqtapunin chaylla nisqa.
However, last night .	Ichaqa, qayna tuta .
The real problem.	Chiqap sasachakuy.
We can no longer help the community.	Manañam llaqtata yanapayta atichwanchu.
I probably like it a lot.	Yaqapaschá anchata gustan.
He sure has been through a lot.	Payqa segurom achkata pasarqa.
I hurried to his house.	Utqayllam wasinman rirqani.
That was a big deal.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi karqan.
Be with him.	Paywan kay.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kanmi.
Then an hour later he was there again.	Hinan huk hora qhepaman hukmanta chaypi kasharqan.
I wasn’t up to it, really.	Ñuqaqa mana chayman hinachu karqani, chiqaptapuni.
It’s such a good thing to do.	Chayna allin ruwaymi.
But he knew that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
Yes, she is a girl.	Arí, payqa sipasmi.
I just, really .	Ñuqaqa chaylla, chiqaptapuni .
I really can't say, for sure.	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atiymanchu, seguro.
This is not correct now.	Kayqa kunanqa manan allinchu.
I can’t stop them anymore.	Manañam chaykunataqa harkayta atiymanchu.
There had to be something else.	Huk imapas kanan karqa.
I don’t need help with that.	Chaypaqqa manan yanapayta necesitasaqchu.
But it is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintam ruwana.
He was that good to me.	Payqa chayna allinmi ñuqapaq karqa.
And they’re very nice.	Hinaspa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
It was just great.	Chaylla hatunmi karqa.
Something new somewhere.	Imapas maypipas musuq.
In fact, it was secondary.	Aswanpas iskay kaqmi karqan.
I want to play this game more often.	Kay pukllayta aswan sapa kuti pukllayta munani.
I can't stand that.	Chaytaqa manam aguantayta atiymanchu.
He was very happy today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha kusisqa tarikurqa.
However, that is not the case.	Ichaqa, manan chay hina ruwaychu.
Still, it was just that.	Chayna kaptinpas chayllam karqa.
He looks really stupid if he does.	Chiqap sonso hinam rikchakun chayta ruwaptinqa.
I couldn’t hold it anymore.	Manañam hapiyta atirqanichu.
This is the .	Kaymi chay .
He knew this was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa mana allin kasqanta.
Unfortunately, there isn't.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam kanchu.
Okay, great catch.	Allinmi, hatun hapisqa.
Fortunately, that’s not quite right.	Ancha kusisqa, chayqa manan allintachu.
So cold, so angry.	Ancha chiri, ancha phiñasqa.
He told me to tell him.	Paymi niwarqa willanaypaq.
But that is usually the case.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim chayna kanman.
Everything is just that.	Tukuy imapas chayllam.
But he couldn’t leave yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi ripuyta atirqachu.
He was lonely and half crazy.	Payqa sapallanmi puriq hinaspa kuskan loco.
It can’t be all that bad.	Mana tukuy chay mana allin kayta atinchu.
I don’t think about that.	Chaypiqa manam piensanichu.
There they are again.	Chaypim yapamanta kachkanku.
Unfortunately it didn't always work out that way.	Llakikuypaqmi mana sapa kutichu chaynata lluqsirqa.
I can’t imagine!.	¡Manan yuyaymanayta atiymanchu!.
Now he tells her to do something.	Kunanqa imatapas ruwananpaqmi nin.
And this is wrong.	Hinaspa kayqa mana allinmi.
No one knew who they were.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu pikuna kasqankuta.
By that I mean, .	Chaywanmi niyta munani, .
Same time.	Kikin pacha.
Unfortunately, that wasn't really the case.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chiqaptachu chayna karqa.
Maybe so well.	Ichapas chayna allinta.
That seems to always be the case.	Chayqa sapa kutilla hinam.
And that he would be back soon.	Hinaspa chaylla kutimunanta.
I have no idea about that.	Chaymantaqa manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani.
That was not a good thing to do.	Chayna ruwayqa manam allinchu karqa.
That’s where it needs to be.	Chayqa maypichus kanan tiyan.
But I did it.	Ichaqa ruwarqani.
Something was there.	Imapas chaypi kasqa.
That’s how it should be done.	Chaynatam ruwana.
But I’ve never been so happy.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina kusisqachu karqani.
He was no longer there.	Payqa manañam chaypichu karqa.
But maybe it was better now.	Ichaqa ichapas kunanqa aswan allin karqa.
Many people eat it.	Achka runakunam mikun.
I didn’t expect it to be that good.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna allin kananta.
There is a lot of action.	Achka ruwaymi kan.
He is the greatest.	Payqa aswan hatunmi.
Maybe more than that.	Ichapas aswan achkata.
Bad morning.	Mana allin paqarin.
I really, really am.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam kani.
Fortunately, it is very easy to do this.	Ancha kusisqa, ancha facilmi kayta ruwayqa.
Very nice looking set, as always.	Ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq churasqa, sapa kuti hina.
You need to do it more often.	Aswan sapa kutim ruwanayki.
Now, that was amazing.	Kunanqa, chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Something must be done quickly.	Imatapas usqhayllan ruwana.
Everything looked ready to go.	Tukuy imapas rinanpaq listo hinam rikchakurqa.
He obviously didn’t know she was married.	Sut’inmi mana yacharqanchu casarasqa kashasqanmanta.
I just want more than this.	Ñuqa ichaqa kaymanta aswan achkatam munani.
He's sure of it.	Payqa segurom chaymanta.
Strangers try to hold the door.	Mana riqsisqa runakunaqa punkuta hap’iyta munanku.
Okay, now is the time.	Allinmi, kunanmi chay tiempo.
I thought something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
It wasn’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
Scared of what he didn’t know.	Mana yachasqanmanta mancharisqa.
I would always be alone.	Sapa kutim sapallay kayman.
He couldn’t believe it was okay.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu allin kasqanta.
Forgive me if you want.	Munaspaqa pampachaykuway.
The man seemed happier.	Chay runaqa aswan kusisqa hinam karqa.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He is a good man in every way.	Payqa tukuy imapipas allin runam.
It could very well be good for you.	Ancha allinmi qampaq allin kanman.
But it was always about time.	Ichaqa sapa kutim yaqa tiempo karqa.
Adults are adults.	Kuraq runakunaqa kuraq runakunam.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruwaymi kanman.
You know why you are here.	Yachankim imanasqa kaypi kasqaykita.
Where this is.	Maypichus kay.
No, he didn't need one.	Manan, manan hukta necesitarqanchu, nispa.
And they want it.	Hinaspa munanku.
That you want to be.	Chay kayta munasqaykita.
Something had to happen.	Imapas kanan karqa.
I wish he wouldn't.	Munaymanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
What is it, he says.	Imataq, nispas nin.
Building a house is difficult.	Wasi ruwayqa sasam.
That’s a no-brainer.	Chayqa mana imapas kaqmi.
It’s almost like he’s scared.	Yaqapaschá mancharisqa hina.
Probably no one will.	Yaqapaschá mana pipas ruwanqachu.
I’m not happy this happened.	Manam kusisqachu kani kay pasasqanmanta.
I don’t quite know how to say it yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yachani imaynata rimanaypaq.
This was an absurd afternoon.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq tarde karqa.
There is no reason for it.	Manan imaraykupas kanchu.
He thinks alone.	Payqa sapallanmi yuyaykun.
But, that’s all.	Ichaqa, chayllam.
It should be very easy for you.	Ancha facilmi kanan qampaq.
Tomorrow, will be a better day.	Paqarin, aswan allin punchawmi kanqa.
It was really, really hard.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sinchi sinchi karqa.
Sure, you'll be busy.	Seguro, ocupasqa kanki.
One is always frustrated.	Huk runaqa sapa kutim hukmanyasqa tarikun.
No, you know.	Manam, yachanki.
It’s still confusing.	Hinallam pantasqa kachkan.
Married well and good.	Casarasqa allin hinaspa allin.
Maybe too long.	Ichapas ancha unayta.
Everything is fine .	Tukuy imapas allinmi .
He probably never will.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
Ultimately, he fails.	Qhepamanmi ichaqa mana allintachu ruwan.
Evil means something.	Mana allinqa imapas niyta munan.
He said that it was.	Payqa nirqam chayna kasqanmanta.
These people were amazing.	Chay runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
But nothing like that happened.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
Everything at the wrong time.	Tukuy ima mana allin pachapi.
Let’s hope that happens.	Suyasun chayna kananta.
I didn’t know who he was.	Manam yacharqanichu pi kasqanmanta.
I know, it's ridiculous.	Yachanim, asikunapaq hinam.
He said that to me in a good way.	Payqa allin hinam chaynata niwarqa.
And that will be it.	Hinaspa chaymi kanqa.
I was very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi karqani.
I never want to talk about him.	Manam haykapipas paymanta rimayta munanichu.
You don’t want it here.	Manam kaypichu munanki.
So he never made a purchase.	Chaymi payqa mana hayk'aqpas rantiyta ruwarqanchu.
Very well placed.	Ancha allin churasqa.
I knew he would make a third.	Yacharqanim kimsa kaq ruwananta.
I thought it would really do something you didn't know.	Yuyarqanim mana yachasqaykita chiqaptapuni ruwananta.
Yeah, it’s really nice.	Arí, chiqap sumaqmi.
He wasn't sure he wanted to remember.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan yuyariyta munasqanmanta.
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinpaq hinam karqa.
Whatever it is.	Imapas kaspa.
I don’t like it either.	Ñuqapas manam gustawanchu.
And you know that.	Hinaspa chayta yachanki.
I'm never good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kani.
He was too tired, too sick.	Payqa llumpay sayk’usqa, llumpay unqusqa.
For the most part, he succeeded.	Yaqa llapanpim allinta ruwarqa.
But no one knows for sure who will win.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan pikuna atipananta.
Go for everything else.	Tukuy imapaqpas riy.
I feel good, really.	Allintam sientekuni, chiqaptapuni.
I know everything you mean.	Tukuy ima niy munasqaykita yachani.
He knows that it can be.	Payqa yachanmi chhayna kanman chayta.
But this is the last time.	Ichaqa kaymi qhepa kuti.
We have a sense of humor.	Yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I mean, not the best.	Niyta munani, mana aswan allinchu.
But they become fast friends.	Ichaqa usqhayllan amigontin kanku.
I don’t make money.	Manam qullqita tarinichu.
He knew no one else would.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana pipas chayta ruwananta.
But never today.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kunan tiempopiqa.
It is too soon for that.	Chaypaqqa ancha utqayllam.
Happy birthday, everyone.	Kusisqa p'unchaw, llapa runa.
But I don’t have the time.	Ichaqa manan tiempoy kanchu.
Good night all.	Allin tuta tukuy.
But you were caught.	Ichaqa hap'isqa karqanki.
I was actually very good to myself.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi karqani ñuqapaq.
First, the .	Ñawpaqtaqa, .
It's amazing how fast that can happen.	Admirakuypaqmi imayna utqaylla chay pasananta.
Unfortunately, anyone can do this.	Llakikuypaqmi, pipas kayta ruwayta atinman.
Tell them you don’t know what it is.	Willay ima kasqanmanta mana yachasqaykita.
Everything was wrong.	Lliwmi mana allinchu karqa.
First, it must exist.	Ñawpaqtaqa kanan tiyan.
You are here again.	Qamqa yapamanta kaypi kachkanki.
And then nothing else.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana imapas.
And he’s sick.	Hinaspa payqa unqusqa kachkan.
Seriously, go now.	Serio, kunan riy.
And that was nice.	Hinaspa chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Otherwise, everything makes no sense.	Mana chayqa, tukuy imapas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
But it never was.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
This statement is not always true.	Kay nisqanqa manam sapa kutichu chiqap.
He would be fine, as always.	Payqa allinmi kanman, sapa kuti hina.
And that’s what he does.	Hinaspa chaytan ruwan.
It was such a quick and efficient process.	Chayna utqaylla hinaspa allin ruwaymi karqa.
He hurried off to find out for himself.	Payqa usqhayllan ripurqan pay kikin chayta yachananpaq.
So it’s more worrying.	Chaymi aswan llakisqa.
Indeed, it often is.	Cheqaqtapunin sapa kutilla chhayna.
There’s probably something about someone doing it.	Yaqapaschá imapas kanman pipas chayta ruwananpaq.
Instead, that’s all that matters.	Aswanpas chaylla ancha allinqa.
That's why I'm going to be a better player.	Chayraykum aswan allin pukllaq kasaq.
There was a problem.	Chaypim sasachakuy karqa.
Why are you here.	Imaraykutaq kaypi kachkanki.
He said it will probably be this week.	Paymi nirqa yaqapaschá kay semanapi kanqa nispa.
I think you’re a good person.	Allin runa kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
It is still the truth.	Kunankamapas cheqaq kaqmi.
But he doesn’t seem happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu rikch’akun.
Very good, very happy.	Ancha allin, ancha kusisqa.
The second method is better.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa aswan allinmi.
He had wanted it for a very long time.	Payqa ancha unayñan chayta munarqan.
A few things.	Iskay kimsa imakuna.
He pretended they were not.	Mana kasqankuta hinam ruwarqa.
Instead, it is failing rapidly.	Aswanpas usqhayllan mana allintachu ruwashan.
But it’s very difficult.	Ichaqa ancha sasam.
That’s all there is to it now.	Chayllam kunanqa kachkan.
First, he says that.	Ñawpaqtaqa, payqa ninmi chay.
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqan chaymantaqa.
He was supposed to be happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kanan karqa.
You said it today.	Kunanmi nirqanki.
That was neither here nor there.	Chayqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu karqan.
At night he couldn't remember sleeping better.	Tuta mana yuyariyta atirqachu aswan allin puñuyta.
Maybe it was always time.	Ichapas sapa kuti tiempo karqa.
It means in advance.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi niyta munan.
I won’t always be there.	Manam sapa kutichu chaypi kasaq.
You don’t think about it.	Chaypiqa manam piensankichu.
Like the same time.	Kikin pacha hina.
But he didn’t want to tell, and he couldn’t tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta munarqanchu, nitaq willayta atirqanchu.
No one is here yet.	Manaraqmi pipas kaypichu kachkan.
They want to be where the action is.	Paykunaqa maypichus ruway kachkan chaypi kayta munanku.
So, it’s that stupid.	Chaymi, chayna sonso.
That was two nights.	Chayqa iskay tutam karqa.
There was nothing really there.	Chaypiqa manam imapas chiqaptaqa karqachu.
It was a summer day.	Chayqa chiri killa punchawmi karqa.
He was a man after all.	Payqa runan karqan tukuy imamanta.
I couldn’t remember anything.	Manañam imatapas yuyariyta atirqanichu.
No one knows about it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa yachanchu.
He is here to help.	Payqa kaypi kachkan yanapananpaq.
I want to hear what kind of person you are.	Imayna runa kasqaykita uyariyta munani.
I would love to do more things.	Anchatam munani aswan achka ruwaykunata ruwayta.
I want to go there too.	Ñuqapas chayman riyta munani.
Everything goes.	Tukuy imapas rin.
Not much though.	Mana anchatachu ichaqa.
He did something hurtful that night.	Chay tutan k’irisqa imatapas ruwarqan.
So tired of it.	Chaymi sayk’usqa chaymanta.
Perhaps he was too crazy not to.	Yaqapaschá llumpay loco karqa mana chayta ruwananpaq.
It happened three times.	Kimsa kutitam pasarqa.
However, this is usually not the case.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim kayqa mana allinchu.
He refused to believe that it was for him.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu chay paypaq kasqanmanta.
They are worried about it.	Chaywanmi llakisqa kachkanku.
A very tired man.	Ancha sayk’usqa runa.
So it happened.	Chaymi pasarqa.
They don’t know any better.	Paykunaqa manan aswan allintachu yachanku.
You think that would be easier, but it’s not.	Yuyanki chayqa aswan facilmi kanman, ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
People want everything to be fast.	Runakunaqa tukuy imapas utqaylla kananta munanku.
This was a man.	Kayqa huk runam karqa.
It can be strong.	Sinchi kanman.
But if you think about it, that’s fine.	Ichaqa chayta yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
He doesn’t always do that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwan.
No, he’s himself.	Manan, pay kikin.
It must be really serious.	Chiqaptam serio kanan.
I hear them all the time.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim uyarini.
Said it was night tonight.	Nisqa kunan tuta tuta kasqanmanta.
He still wanted to.	Payqa hinallam munarqa.
But he knew something.	Ichaqa imatapas yacharqanmi.
It was freezing cold but she was amazing.	Chiri chiri karqa ichaqa payqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Now that means something.	Kunanqa chaymi imapas niyta munan.
Again, this makes good sense.	Yapamanta, kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
An important night.	Huk importante tuta.
We disagree on this point.	Kaypiqa manan acuerdopichu kayku.
Soon you will be with us.	Pisi tiempollamantan ñoqaykuwan kuska kanki.
I feel happier.	Aswan kusisqam tarikuni.
I don't really like that.	Chayqa manam anchatachu gustan.
That means a happier you!.	Chayqa niyta munan huk aswan kusisqa qan!.
I wanted to be so bad out there.	Chay hawapi ancha millay kayta munarqani.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allin kasqa.
He was pretty drunk.	Payqa sumaq machasqa kasqa.
I really wanted to ask the most important question.	Anchatan munarqani aswan importante kaqta tapuyta.
That will be the right thing to do for you.	Chayqa kanqa qampaq allin ruwaymi.
One or two at least.	Huk utaq iskay aswanpas.
He didn’t mean that.	Manam chaytachu niyta munarqa.
That’s kind of not like him.	Chayqa huk laya mana pay hinachu.
Such lack of seriousness.	Chayna mana serio kay.
It was cold, bitter cold and black.	Chayqa chiri, sinchi chiri, yana ima kasqa.
He seems very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam kachkan.
Maybe you'll get hurt.	Ichapas k'irisqa kanki.
People are the ones.	Runakunaqa kanku.
I feel amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi sientekuni.
But I didn’t see him with anyone.	Ichaqa manan piwanpas rikurqanichu.
He had a few ideas.	Payqa iskay kimsa yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
The process was not difficult at all.	Chay ruwayqa manan imapipas sasachu karqan.
Then there is time.	Chaymantaqa kanmi tiempo.
But of course that’s not true at all.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayqa manan cheqaqchu ni imapipas.
That is a very impressive thing.	Chayqa sinchi admirakuypaqmi.
He was never real.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
Very scared of it.	Ancha mancharisqa chaymanta.
I can’t sing either.	Ñuqapas manam takiyta atiymanchu.
He now joins me to talk more about this.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqawan kuska kaymanta astawan rimanaypaq.
Everything was secure.	Tukuy imapas segurom karqa.
I don't understand why.	Manam entiendenichu imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Needless to say, it was.	Manañam niyta munanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
You never knew how someone would react.	Manan hayk’aqpas yacharqankichu pipas imayna ruwananta.
I’m glad I’m part of this process.	Kusikuni kay ruwaypi kasqaymanta.
Someone here in desperate need of help.	Kaypi pipas anchata yanapayta necesitasqanmanta.
But one last thing.	Ichaqa huk qhepa kaq.
That says it doesn’t exist.	Chayqa ninmi mana kanchu nispa.
I didn’t see how serious it could be.	Manam rikurqanichu imayna serio kanman chayta.
Go, go, go.	Riy, riy, riy.
Someone knows something.	Pipas imatapas yachan.
A better man, if you will.	Aswan allin runa, munaspaqa.
I had never heard of that before.	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu.
There was a young man.	Huk wayna kasqa.
He had got everything wrong.	Payqa tukuy imatam mana allintachu hapisqa.
I can’t remember why, really.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu imarayku, chiqaptaqa.
You're crazy, man.	Qam loco, runa.
I’m very good at a challenge.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi kani huk sasachakuypi.
Yes, you know.	Arí, yachanki.
Everything should be better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinmi kanan.
It really has no choice.	Chiqamanta mana ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
It was something devastating.	Chayqa imapas sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He was nowhere to be found.	Manam maypipas karqachu.
In fact, I couldn’t stand it anymore.	Aswanpas manañan chayta aguantayta atirqanichu.
He was a great re-teacher.	Payqa anchatam yapamanta yachachiq karqa.
There’s no reason he’s happy about it.	Manan imaraykupas kusisqachu kashan chaytaqa.
Sometimes.	Wakin kuti.
I’m not even sure it’s right.	Manam segurochu kani nitaq allin kasqanmanta.
Can't seem to find a purchase anywhere.	Mana maypipas rantiyta tariyta atinchu hina.
It depends on the number.	Chayqa hayk’a kasqanmantan kanqa.
He looked at her carefully.	Payqa allintan qhawarirqan.
It looks real.	Chiqap rikchakun.
Now, maybe that’s a good thing.	Kunanqa, ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
I feel like a stranger, I feel like a wanderer.	Mana riqsisqa runa hinam tarikuni, puriq hinam tarikuni.
No it may not be the case.	Manan manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
What could be better than that?.	¿Imataq chaymanta aswan allin kanman?.
No one knows anything about it.	Manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas yachanchu.
Early afternoon.	Tarde temprano.
Yes, that is not a good thing.	Arí, chayqa manam allinchu.
After that, he repeatedly refused.	Chay qhepamanmi ichaqa sapa kutilla mana munarqanchu.
I think you’re a busy busy person.	Yuyaykuni ocupasqa ocupasqa runa kasqaykita.
This was mostly good.	Kayqa yaqa llapanpim allin karqa.
I hope he never finds out.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas chayta yachananta.
Then there’s time.	Chaymantaqa kanmi pacha.
But it was unfortunate.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I know that’s the case.	Chayna kasqanmantaqa yachanim.
It’s good to do it sometimes.	Wakin kutipi ruwayqa allinmi.
But it can be good.	Ichaqa allintan kanman.
I feel very happy.	Llumpay kusisqam tarikuni.
Nothing is ever good enough.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas allinchu.
If you think about it, it would be good.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi kanman.
This statement was never true.	Kay nisqanqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
Black man.	Yana runa.
It’s good, it’s very good.	Allinmi ancha allin.
Eventually you will.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwanki.
Great for you.	Hatun qampaq.
He was afraid of it.	Chayman mancharisqa.
They always are.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim kanku.
I want to see that city.	Chay llaqtata rikuyta munani.
Let’s hope it’s okay.	Suyasun allin kananpaq.
That should be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanan.
But it's clear.	Ichaqa sut'inmi.
Now he was terrified.	Kunanqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
That’s what happened after that.	Chay qhepamanmi chay hina karqan.
He stayed behind.	Payqa qhepamanmi qhepakurqan.
And he looks good.	Hinaspa allin rikchayniyuq.
I knew very well what it was like.	Ancha allintam yacharqani imayna kasqanmanta.
This is obviously quite.	Kayqa sut’inmi allinta.
In fact, the best black .	Chiqaptaqa, aswan allin yana .
I am okay with it now.	Kunanqa allinmi kachkani chaywan.
There is beauty in everything.	Tukuy imapipas sumaq kaymi kan.
A lot of things are good.	Achka imapas allinmi.
He wanted to get out of it, all of it.	Payqa chaymanta lluqsiyta munarqan, tukuy chaymanta.
It came a long time ago.	Unayñan hamurqan.
You know what you did wrong.	Yachankim ima mana allin ruwasqaykita.
He must be sure.	Payqa segurom kanan.
I couldn’t agree.	Manam acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu.
Now, he is right.	Kunanqa, payqa allintam rimachkan.
But it always seems to work.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi allinpaq rikch’akun.
He seemed to agree.	Payqa acuerdopi hinam karqa.
He’s the nicest thing here.	Payqa kaypiqa aswan sumaqmi.
True, but hidden.	Chiqap, ichaqa pakasqa.
No one knows but you.	Manan pipas yachanchu aswanpas qanmi.
I wanted to know about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta yachayta munarqani.
I’m actually really happy with it.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani chaywan.
He certainly would.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
Do a great job this week.	Kay semanapi hatun llamkayta ruway.
Said they were together.	Nisqa kuska kasqankuta.
Everyone was very sad.	Lliwmi ancha llakisqa karqaku.
I was immediately angry.	Chayllam phiñasqa karqani.
He wasn’t supposed to be.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
He is a very busy man.	Payqa ancha ocupasqa runam.
He is happy about it.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan chaymanta.
No, it’s too big.	Manan, ancha hatun.
But then, it was meant to be.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chayna kananpaqmi karqa.
No one could see it.	Manam pipas rikuyta atirqachu.
I don't remember.	Yuyarinichu.
But the truth was, she didn’t want him to.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi karqan, manan munarqanchu chayta ruwananta.
I haven’t noticed it yet.	Manam kunankamapas repararqanichu.
They’re not there.	Paykunaqa mana chaypichu kanku.
Man means man.	Runaqa runa niyta munan.
I don’t believe they exist.	Manam creenichu kasqankuta.
If so, go with it.	Chayna kaptinqa chaywan riy.
I don't really want to do that.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu ruwayta munani.
Or opened it for the first time.	Utaq ñawpaq kutita kicharirqa.
You don’t know what it’s like here.	Mana yachankichu kaypi imayna kasqanmanta.
You have to do it right.	Allintam ruwanayki.
She can’t believe she doesn’t like the dress.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu chay p’acha mana gustasqanmanta.
I hope we can do that.	Suyachkani chayta ruwanaykupaq.
It wasn’t good at all.	Manam allinchu karqa ni imapipas.
Certainly with you.	Chiqamanta qamwan.
Everyone knows that, and it's always there.	Chaytaqa llapallankum yachanku, chaymi sapa kutilla kachkan.
No, no, not even.	Mana, mana, mana nitaq.
There, as usual, was no one.	Chaypiqa, sapa kuti hina, manam pipas karqachu.
I had no time to say anything.	Manam tiempoy karqachu imatapas rimanaypaq.
He bought it.	Chaytaqa rantirqa.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
This thing is.	Kay imapas.
So, here you are.	Chaymi, kaypi kanki.
He was the one who was guilty.	Paymi huchayoq karqan.
He had no idea how he felt now.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kunan imayna sientekusqanmanta.
It felt so, so confusing.	Chayna, ancha pantasqa hinam tarikurqa.
Half today, half tomorrow.	Kunan punchaw kuskan, paqarin kuskan.
Maybe more things.	Ichapas aswan imakunatapas.
That’s not just me.	Chayqa mana ñuqallachu.
I really want you to be here.	Chiqamanta kaypi kanaykita munani.
He didn't really know what to do.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan ima ruwananta.
Who knows why he didn’t.	¿Pitaq yachan imanasqa mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He knew what he was going to do today.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan p’unchay ima ruwananta.
I think that’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa nispan yuyaykuni.
At first, no one noticed.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan pipas repararqanchu.
He’s obviously not sure.	Sut’inmi mana segurochu kashan.
He wanted to think.	Yuyaymanayta munarqa.
But, he didn’t do that.	Ichaqa, manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Great people, actually.	Hatun runakuna, chiqaptaqa.
And do that quickly.	Hinaspa chayta usqhaylla ruway.
It is important to speak in a modern way.	Ancha allinmi kunan tiempopi hina rimayqa.
This seems a bit absurd.	Kayqa huk chikan mana yuyayniyuq hinam.
It is not difficult to do.	Manam sasachu ruwayqa.
He was, after all, a man now.	Payqa, tukuy imamanta, kunan runa karqa.
This turned out a little better.	Kayqa aswan pisi allintam lluqsirqa.
I still can't figure it out.	Kunankamapas manam yuyaymanayta atinichu.
You have said that many times.	Chaynataqa achka kutitam nirqanki.
Learn to be a good person again.	Allin runa kayta yapamanta yachay.
No one seems to know what that could have been.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imachus chay kanman karqan chayta.
Actually, it’s better.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan allinmi.
We are married adults.	Casarasqa kuraq runakunam kanchik.
So don't miss this opportunity.	Chaymi kay oportunidadta ama qunqaychu.
It would have been wonderful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman karqa.
He just went, and pretty fast.	Payqa chaylla rirqa, hinaspa allin utqaylla.
You can't sit here for ten days.	Manam kaypiqa chunka punchawchu tiyayta atiwaqchu.
Like me, he thinks.	Ñoqa hina, payqa yuyaykun.
The man looked amused.	Chay runaqa kusisqa qhawarisqa.
Not really sure.	Mana chiqap segurochu.
This one was proud, but tired.	Kayqa orgulloso karqan, ichaqa sayk’usqa.
But it wasn’t very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
We have a pretty good idea of ​​where it is.	Allin allin yuyayniyuqmi kayku maypi kasqanmanta.
I am a stranger here, after all.	Kaypiqa mana riqsisqa runam kani, tukuy imamanta.
I’m glad he is.	Kusikuni pay kasqanmanta.
So that’s a challenge.	Chaymi chayqa huk sasachakuy.
I should have done that a long time ago.	Unayñam chaytaqa ruwanay karqa.
Make them strong.	Chaykunataqa sinchita ruway.
He was alone in his very big house.	Ancha hatun wasinpi sapallan kasqa.
I have always been yours.	Ñoqaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi qampaq karqani.
They were the worst people there.	Paykunaqa chaypiqa aswan mana allin runakunam karqaku.
Don’t do this and do that.	Ama kayta ruwaspa chayta ruwaychu.
But maybe out there.	Ichaqa ichapas chay hawapi.
They’re probably.	Paykunaqa ichapas.
He wasn’t intelligent.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
Yes, he does exist.	Arí, payqa kanmi.
But he seemed very happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
Another bad thing.	Huk mana allin ruway.
Not quite, really.	Mana allintachu, chiqaptapuni.
But something else about that.	Ichaqa huk imapas chaymantaqa.
But it seemed fine at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
So it is now.	Chaymi kunanqa kachkan.
If he was very angry.	Sichus ancha phiñasqa karqan chayqa.
I’m excited about that too.	Ñuqapas chaymantaqa kusisqam kachkani.
This was an important one.	Kayqa importante kaqmi karqa.
However, this is not always such a success.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina allin ruwayqa.
Disappointed but not surprised.	Hukmanyasqa ichaqa mana admirasqa.
We are here today.	Kunanmi kaypi kachkaniku.
Now about that.	Kunanqa chaymanta.
Or, something like that.	Utaq, imapas chayna.
But he can't do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwanmanchu.
So I thought about it.	Chaymi chayta yuyaykurqani.
It should do everything you want it to do.	Tukuy ima munasqaykita ruwanan tiyan.
Maybe he really likes it.	Ichapas payqa anchata gustan.
I’m sorry.’ He was disappointed.	Pampachaykuway’, nispas hukmanyasqa.
I am very excited about this.	Kaymantaqa ancha kusisqam tarikuni.
He wanted to tell her, but he thought better of it.	Willayta munarqan, ichaqa aswan allinta yuyaykurqan.
And that’s really the case.	Hinaspa chaymi chiqaptapuni chayna.
It can be pretty difficult.	Allin sasa kanman.
Then this problem happened.	Chaymanta kay sasachakuy pasarqa.
I don’t know, but maybe you do.	Manam yachanichu, ichaqa ichapas yachanki.
But who knows.	Ichaqa pitaq yachan.
And so that’s what we did.	Hinaspa chaymi chayta ruwarqayku.
But it wasn’t good enough.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kasqa.
He’s anything though.	Payqa imapas ichaqa.
I never really did it.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa ruwarqanichu.
I thought he would.	Yuyarqanim chayna ruwananta.
He never talked much about it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa anchatachu rimarqan.
He smoked more often.	Payqa aswan achka kutitam cigarrota pitaq.
It’s almost too easy.	Yaqa ancha facilmi.
He had one last thing to do.	Payqa huk qhepa ruwanan karqan.
A few years ago now.	Iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqta kunan.
Maybe lower, or higher.	Ichapas aswan pisi, utaq aswan hatun.
It doesn’t mean it won’t.	Manam niyta munanchu mana kanqachu.
We have no idea what to do.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanchik ima ruwananchikpaq.
They’re worried about it.	Paykunaqa chaymanta llakisqa kachkanku.
No one was sure what was going on.	Manam pipas segurochu karqa imakuna kasqanmantaqa.
The process was very easy.	Chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
Really good food.	Chiqamanta allin mikhuy.
It's really crazy how true it is.	Chiqaptam loco imayna chiqap kasqanmanta.
He is a very strange man.	Payqa ancha mana riqsisqa runam.
But I feel good about it.	Ichaqa allintam sientekuni.
Why, this is amazing.	Imarayku, kayqa admirakuypaqmi.
As always, alone.	Sapa kuti hina, sapallan.
He’s a little too excited.	Payqa huk chhikantan nishuta kusisqa kashan.
He was crazy about her.	Payqa paymanta loco kasqa.
Well, you can't.	Allinmi, manam atiwaqchu.
I don't want to hear that again.	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta uyariyta munanichu.
I was always very smart.	Sapa kutim ancha yachaysapa karqani.
He doesn’t go to school with you.	Manan qanwan kuskachu escuelaman rin.
The massive multiplayer.	Chay hatun achka pukllaq.
However, the process would not take much longer.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa aswan unaytachu kanman.
So it’s almost a person.	Chaymi yaqa huk runa.
It was actually amazing.	Chiqaptaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I can play with it.	Chaywanmi pukllayta atiyman.
But then there is never.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan hayk’aqpas kanchu.
Know who you are not.	Yachay pichus mana kasqaykita.
I can’t really imagine why.	Manam chiqaptachu yuyaymanayta atiyman imarayku.
He was always positive.	Payqa sapa kutim allin yuyayniyuq karqa.
I still have never seen anything like it.	Kunankamapas manam haykapipas chaynataqa rikurqanichu.
That would be me.	Chayqa ñuqam kayman.
But I’m good at it.	Ichaqa allinmi kani chaypi.
He wants it to happen.	Payqa munanmi chayna kananta.
So it’s sad.	Chaymi llakisqa.
I wanted to walk with you.	Ñuqapas qamwan kuska puriyta munarqani.
I don’t want that for you.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu qampaq.
It looks like this.	Rikchakun kay hina.
I just found out last week for sure.	Chayraqmi qayna semana yacharqani seguro.
Maybe he's injured.	Ichapas k'irisqa kachkan.
He still couldn't believe it.	Hinallam mana creeyta atirqachu.
And in the world.	Hinaspa kay pachapi.
So, that’s great.	Chaymi, chayqa ancha allinmi.
Can't really get away with it.	Mana chiqaptachu lluqsiyta atin.
Very reluctant for him to do so.	Ancha mana munanchu payqa chayta ruwananpaq.
It's like one after another after another.	Hukmanta hukmanta hukmanta hinam.
They are not as bad as humans.	Manan runakuna hinachu millay kanku.
I never have the time.	Manam haykapipas tiempoy kanchu.
But he knew that was not the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chhayna kasqanmanta.
They know the secret.	Paykunaqa yachanku pakasqa kaqta.
This morning she did her best to find out.	Kunan paqarinmi tukuy atisqanman hina ruwarqa chayta yachananpaq.
I am a mysterious person.	Ñuqaqa pakasqa runam kani.
They were all bad.	Llapallankum mana allin karqaku.
Never, maybe.	Mana hayk’aqpas, ichapas.
He was the youngest.	Payqa aswan sullk’a kaqmi karqan.
That’s the second thing.	Chayqa iskay kaqmi.
Next is the university.	Chay qhepamanmi kan hatun yachay wasi.
People usually don’t.	Runakunaqa yaqa llapanpim mana.
Maybe it was the worst part.	Ichapas aswan mana allin kaq karqa.
She thought he was.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi pay chay hina kananpaq.
He did everything he said he would do.	Payqa tukuy ima nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
It was a good thing.	Allin kaqmi karqa.
It’s much easier than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan facilmi.
I don’t disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopichu kani.
Both were excellent and contemporary.	Iskayninkum ancha allin hinaspa chay tiempopi hina karqaku.
I feel happy and proud.	Kusisqa hinaspa orgulloso sientekuni.
But that is why you are here.	Ichaqa chayraykum kaypi kachkanki.
He was always out in the country.	Payqa sapa kutim llaqtaman hawapi kaq.
I can’t ignore that.	Chaytaqa manam mana uyariyta atiymanchu.
So there will be time for that.	Chaymi chaypaqqa tiempo kanqa.
He knows where he is.	Payqa yachan maypi kasqanmanta.
Beautiful, as always.	Sumaq, sapa kuti hina.
He probably knew everything.	Payqa yaqapaschá tukuy imatapas yacharqan.
Maybe he knows better.	Ichapas pay aswan allinta yachan.
Again it was good.	Yapamanta allinmi karqa.
Would it have been true.	¿Cheqaqchu kanman karqan.
One of them will be good.	Hukninmi allin kanqa.
Yes, he said yes.	Arí, payqa arí nisqa.
But that wasn’t the case, not quite.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, manan allintachu.
He looked sad, he looked sad.	Payqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa, llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Easier to do then you might think.	Aswan facil ruway chaymanta ichapas yuyaykunki.
You never know who will actually be successful.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu pichus cheqaqtapuni allin ruwaq kananta.
But that night was the worst.	Ichaqa chay tutan aswan mana allin karqan.
He was home for a week.	Payqa huk semanan wasinpi kasharqan.
This was supposed to be the big one.	Kaymi hatun kaq kanan karqa.
That is always the hardest part.	Chayqa sapa kutim aswan sasa ruwayqa.
It is no longer useful.	Manañan imapaqpas valenchu.
The world is a man.	Kay pacha runa.
He meant this.	Payqa kaytan niyta munarqan.
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatan munarqan.
He is a .	Payqa huk .
He did not immediately announce it.	Payqa manan chayllachu chayta willarqan.
In fact, they already are.	Chiqaptaqa, ñam chayna kachkanku.
And it looked like that.	Hinaspa chayna rikchakurqa.
I can’t ignore that.	Manam chaytaqa mana uyariyta atiymanchu.
He was not like the old man.	Payqa manan ñawpaq runa hinachu karqan.
Where did he get that thing? 	¿Maymantataq chay imatapas hurqurqa?
I had no one to talk to.	Manam pipas rimanaypaq karqachu.
Yes, it should be.	Arí, chayna kanan tiyan.
I was a little tired too.	Ñoqapas huk chhikantan sayk’usqa karqani.
Please share this with me.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta willay.
It was obviously massive.	Sut’inmi karqan hatun hatun kashasqanmanta.
Been here a few times.	Kaypi karqani huk iskay kimsa kutita.
He knows what’s best for him.	Payqa yachanmi imachus paypaq allin kaqta.
What is the probability of that? 	¿Imaynataq chay kanman?
Huge huge difference.	Hatun hatun chikan kay.
They are probably the same.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanku.
I am very disappointed.	Anchatam hukmanyasqa kachkani.
Looks nice for a while but not for long.	Sumaq rikchakun huk rato ichaqa mana unaytachu.
The same thing happened a lot.	Chayna kaqmi achkata pasarqa.
No, of course you do.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwanki.
I think they’re happy.	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kasqankuta.
He is no longer there now.	Kunanqa manaña chaypichu.
Doing one is absurd.	Hukta ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
It was cold, very cold.	Chiri kasqa, ancha chiri.
He knows though.	Payqa yachanmi ichaqa.
It is easy to avoid.	Chaytaqa mana ruwaymi facilmi.
That’s the most beautiful girl in the world.	Chayqa kay pachapi aswan sumaq sipasmi.
That’s great, so thank you for that.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, chaymi chaymanta gracias.
I’m the only one who doesn’t feel right.	Ñuqallam mana allintachu sientekuni.
This will not work.	Kayqa manam allintachu ruwanqa.
So many stupid people.	Chayna achka sonso runakuna.
Usually, but not always.	Yaqa llapanpim, ichaqa manam sapa kutichu.
And really cold.	Hinaspa chiqap chiri.
And they both seemed happy.	Hinaspa iskayninku kusisqa hina karqanku.
So they both agree.	Chaymi iskayninku acuerdopi kanku.
Maybe there are more.	Ichapas aswan achka kanman.
I’m kind of worried.	Ñuqaqa huk laya llakisqa kachkani.
I think he probably did.	Yuyaykuni yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
It does a lot of things.	Anchatam ruwan.
He says okay, tell me what you know.	Payqa allinmi, willaway ima yachasqaykita nispa.
Don’t forget!.	¡Ama qunqaychu!.
So this was after all.	Chaymi kayqa karqan tukuy imamanta.
The first deals with wealth.	Ñawpaq kaqmi riman qhapaq kaymanta.
Do your best for him.	Paypaq tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
But the truth is, no one really knows.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
It was always very cold.	Sapa kutim ancha chiri karqa.
It’s a new thing.	Musuq kaqmi.
I know you are doing better.	Yachanim aswan allinta ruwasqaykita.
I quickly thought back.	Usqhayllan qhepaman yuyaykurqani.
It was ridiculous now.	Kunanqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
Obviously many were injured.	Sut’inmi askha k’irisqa karqanku.
And he went away.	Hinan payqa ripurqan.
I'm not so sure it will.	Manam chayna segurochu kani chayna kananta.
But maybe you're doing something else.	Ichaqa ichapas hukta ruwachkanki.
He didn’t want to be here.	Payqa manan kaypi kayta munarqanchu.
The right thing to do is the right thing to do.	Allin ruwayqa allin ruwaymi.
I am like you, at the moment.	Ñuqaqa qam hinam kani, kunan pacha.
If not, it’s fine .	Mana chayqa, allinmi .
Why thank you.	Imaraykutaq gracias.
I wasn’t good enough.	Mana allinchu karqani.
That’s all he knew.	Chayllam payqa yacharqa.
And this, several times a day.	Hinaspa kay, sapa punchaw achka kutita.
There were always crowds.	Sapa kutim achka runakunaqa karqaku.
Everyone was sick and scared.	Lliwmi unqusqa mancharisqa karqaku.
Things are not right, not right at all.	Imapas manam allinchu, manam allinchu ni imapipas.
Really fast paced.	Chiqap utqaylla puriq.
Now it's clear.	Kunanqa sut'inmi.
What a teacher he is.	Ima yachachiqmi payqa.
They were travelers.	Paykunaqa puriq runakunam karqaku.
That goes from being the most popular.	Chayqa aswan riqsisqa kasqanmantam rin.
He’ll be so proud of you.	Payqa ancha orgulloso kanqa qanmanta.
I know that you are.	Yachanim qam chayna kasqaykita.
That was the hard part.	Chayqa sasa kaqmi karqa.
I did a bit of everything.	Tukuy imamanta huk chhikanta ruwarqani.
To make a statement.	Huk rimayta ruwanapaq.
All well and happy.	Tukuy allin hinaspa kusisqa.
That’s the thing .	Chayqa chaymi .
He always wants to have sex with her.	Payqa sapa kutim munan paywan puñuyta.
The crowd is amazing.	Chay achka runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi.
How does he know so much.	Imaynatataq yachan achkata.
He did an amazing job.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi llamkayta ruwarqa.
They are good for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi kanku.
To do what you don’t want to do.	Mana munasqaykita ruwanaykipaq.
But it is not	Ichaqa manan chayqa .
And that went wrong.	Hinaspa chaymi mana allintachu rirqa.
I’m not really a talkative person.	Manam chiqaptachu rimaq runa kani.
Unfortunately, there is no baseball.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam kanchu béisbol.
They know exactly what that is.	Paykunaqa allintan yachanku imachus chay kasqanmanta.
And this looks really nice.	Hinaspa kayqa chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
Okay, so he was quick.	Allinmi, chaymi payqa utqaylla karqa.
They’re all crazy.	Llapallankum loco kanku.
About thirty times more.	Yaqa kimsa chunka kuti aswan achka.
If he is right.	Sichus payqa allin kashan chayqa.
I couldn't wait to see it.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu qawayta.
He made no reply.	Payqa manan huk kutichiyta ruwarqanchu.
This is how, why.	Kayna imayna, imarayku.
He said he didn't know much more than that.	Payqa nirqam chaymanta aswan achkata mana yachasqayta.
No, that would have been so easy.	Manan, chayqa ancha facilmi kanman karqan.
They’re the ones who don’t.	Paykunaqa chay mana.
They all look so nice.	Llapallankum ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq kanku.
But obviously it does.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chay ruwasqanqa.
This won’t do it anymore.	Kayqa manañam ruwanqachu.
Nice, but cold.	Sumaq, ichaqa chiri.
I actually don’t do that much anymore.	Chiqaptaqa manañam anchatachu chaytaqa ruwani.
I know he is not happy with you.	Yachanim qanwan mana kusisqa kasqanta.
There was coffee.	Chaypim kukata kasqa.
Very likely I did.	Ancha yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqani.
But one day he will!.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi ruwanqa!.
They weren’t unhappy.	Paykunaqa manan mana kusisqachu karqanku.
No one is really happy.	Mana pipas chiqap kusisqachu.
It is still the same practice today.	Kunankamapas chayna ruwaymi kachkan.
It just doesn’t make any sense.	Chaylla mana ima yuyayniyuqchu.
They know the food.	Paykunaqa yachanku chay mikhunata.
But he didn’t really do it.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
He always looked pretty good.	Payqa sapa kutim allin allin rikchakurqa.
Wherever you want to go.	Maymanpas riy munasqayki.
I don't think it would do anyone much good.	Manam pitapas ancha allintachu ruwanman nispam piensani.
But the process is really not that difficult.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chay ruwayqa mana chhayna sasachu.
He sensed something was terribly wrong.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas manchay mana allin kasqanmanta.
The process, however, was difficult.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa sasa karqa.
I have to agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kanay.
It can be a little rich.	Huk chikan qhapaq kanman.
Everyone has an opinion on this.	Tukuy runam kaymanta huk yuyayniyuq kanku.
But this is really the first.	Ichaqa kayqa cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq kaq.
If you’re good, you’re good.	Sichus allin kanki chayqa, allinmi kanki.
He can’t stop her.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atinmanchu.
That’s how I’m good.	Chay hinaqa allinmi kani.
I mean, it’s right.	Allintam niyta munani.
It will be unique to you.	Chayqa qampaq sapallan kanqa.
At least, actually.	Aswanpas, chiqaptaqa.
Yes, some people are better.	Arí, wakin runakunaqa aswan allinmi.
No, he wasn't sure about her.	Manan, payqa manan paymanta segurochu kasharqan.
Really ugly stuff.	Chiqamanta millay imakuna.
If you really want to know.	Sichus chiqaptapuni yachayta munanki.
I couldn’t answer happily.	Manam atirqanichu kusisqa kutichiyta.
But about this another time.	Ichaqa kaymanta huk kutipi.
After all this time, you did.	Tukuy chay tiempo qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqanki.
He wasn't very good, and he knew it.	Payqa manan ancha allinchu karqan, chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
Someone will be there.	Pipas chaypi kanqa.
He died in hospital later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepamanmi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
Easy couldn’t be this.	Facil mana kayta atirqachu.
I don’t know if he managed in the end.	Mana yachanichu sichus tukukuypi atirqanchu icha manachu chayta.
He was there for a reason.	Payqa imaraykupas chaypi kasqanmantam karqa.
I really wanted to do the same.	Ñoqapas anchatan munarqani chayta ruwayta.
And you know, it probably was.	Hinaspa yachanki, yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
I knew he could be fast.	Yacharqanim utqaylla kayta atisqanmanta.
But then, no idea.	Ichaqa chaymanta, mana yuyayniyuq.
But how do you do it.	Ichaqa imaynatataq ruway.
Maybe you know something.	Ichapas imatapas yachanki.
About half an hour later.	Yaqa kuskan hora qhepamanmi.
You do everything on your own.	Tukuy imatam sapallayki ruwanki.
You’re drunk.	Machasqa kanki.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan atiwaqchu.
He knew what he was going to do next.	Payqa yacharqanmi qhepaman ima ruwananta.
Now they were both angry.	Kunanqa iskayninkum phiñasqa karqaku.
I had no idea what this could be.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani ima kay kanman chaymanta.
We’ve just been drunk together.	Chayllaraqmi kuska machasqa kayku.
Here the two disagree.	Kaypiqa iskayninku mana acuerdopichu kanku.
I don’t need to be anywhere else.	Manam maypipas kaytaqa necesitasaqchu.
Yes, two years.	Arí, iskay wata.
The wise man.	Chay yachaysapa.
Even if it is true.	Chiqap kaptinpas.
She is a smart, accomplished young woman.	Payqa allin yachaysapa, allin ruwaq sipasmi.
Can you do it.	¿Atiwaqchu.
I can't remember his name now.	Kunanqa manam sutinta yuyarinichu.
True or false.	Chiqap utaq mana chiqap.
That, after all, is what it is.	Chayqa, tukuy imamanta, chayna kasqanmanta.
But he wasn’t a good teacher.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachachiq.
Not so yet now.	Mana chay hinaqa manaraq kunan.
He is no longer useful or useful.	Payqa manañan allinchu nitaq imapaqpas valenchu.
There were a lot of people.	Ancha achka runakunam karqa.
Tonight should be his night.	Kunan tutaqa tutan kanan.
I couldn’t leave alone.	Manam sapallan ripuyta atirqanichu.
I know really well.	Chiqaptam allinta yachani.
All fast food.	Tukuy utqaylla mikhuy.
Everyone can eat this.	Kaytaqa lliwmi mikuyta atin.
It wouldn’t be right on my part.	Mana allinchu kanman ñuqamanta.
A single person.	Huk sapallan runa.
If this sounds familiar, it should.	Sichus kay riqsisqa hina uyarikun chayqa, kanan tiyan.
That can be very frustrating.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi kanman.
There never is, really.	Manam haykapipas kanchu, chiqaptaqa.
There is no point in it.	Manam imapaqpas kanchu.
He is very curious.	Payqa anchatam yachayta munan.
But you’re still doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam ruwachkanki.
I should have done it sooner.	Chaytaqa aswan utqayllam ruwanay karqa.
And despite everything else, he made it better.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas allin kaptinpas aswan allinta ruwarqa.
I do this again and again.	Kaytaqa yapamanta yapamanta ruwani.
I had never seen him before that night.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay tuta ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
That’s what I wanted to do again.	Chayqa hukmanta ruwayta munarqani.
It still is, for that matter.	Hinallam kachkan, chaypaqqa.
It's day, it's night.	P'unchawmi, tutan.
I don't think you'll ever do that.	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaykipaqqa piensanichu.
No one seems to know why.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
He still wasn't sure.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasqa.
He seemed hungry.	Yarqasqa hinam karqa.
No, that’s not going to work.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
That will be tomorrow.	Chayqa paqarinmi kanqa.
I hope it comes soon.	Suyachkani utqaylla hamunanta.
However, he had a strange idea about it.	Ichaqa, chaymantaqa huk mana riqsisqa yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Such an approach is not unique.	Chayna ruwayqa manam sapallanchu.
He was probably sick of it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaywan unqusqa.
Now he knows the truth.	Kunanqa cheqaq kaqta yachan.
I’m going to make this movie.	Kay peliculata ruwasaq.
He was the same as before.	Payqa ñawpaqpi hinam karqa.
He came right away.	Payqa chayllam hamurqa.
Probably for the worst.	Yaqapaschá aswan mana allinpaq.
I can’t tell you yet.	Manaraqmi willayta atinichu.
He was the worst.	Paymi aswan millay karqan.
I’m just thinking about how wonderful it would be.	Chayraqmi yuyaykushani imayna sumaq kanman chayta.
He is here every three days.	Payqa sapa kimsa punchawmi kaypi kachkan.
I don’t like doing anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayqa gustanchu.
He knows he can’t rush things.	Payqa yachanmi mana usqhayllachu imatapas ruwananta.
Everything about it is secondary.	Tukuy imapas chaymantaqa iskay kaqmi.
Yeah, okay, sure.	Arí, allinmi, seguro.
Sure, I can do that.	Seguro, chayta ruwayta atiyman.
That's never going to happen.	Chayqa manan hayk'aqpas kanqachu.
Really worried about that.	Chiqamanta chaymanta llakisqa.
I at least.	Ñuqaqa aswanpas.
The process was really easy and quick.	Chay ruwayqa chiqaptam facil hinaspa utqaylla karqa.
But it’s a mistake.	Ichaqa pantasqa kashan.
But that won’t always be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanqa.
They are not better than you.	Paykunaqa manan qanmanta aswan allinchu kanku.
This was the first time here.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq kuti kaypi.
That means you are really good.	Chayqa niyta munan chiqap allin kasqaykita.
The coffee was gone.	Chay kukata manaña kasqa.
Perhaps that was the case here.	Yaqapaschá kaypiqa chayna karqa.
I know what to say.	Yachanim ima niyta.
All the studying, you know .	Tukuy estudiayta, yachanki .
You may not know that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yachankichu.
But it wasn’t an easy task.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chay ruwayqa karqan.
He couldn't see anyone.	Payqa manam pitapas rikuyta atirqachu.
This is the pinnacle of all modern practice.	Kayqa llapa kunan pacha ruwaypi aswan hatunmi.
Both are extremely talented.	Iskayninkum llumpay yachaysapa kanku.
And that was really nice.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
The anonymity was great.	Mana riqsisqa kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He said it was a beautiful day.	Payqa sumaq punchaw kananpaqmi nirqa.
Describe whether it is correct or not.	Allinchu icha manachu chayta willay.
A man came out.	Huk runam lluqsirqa.
He was a bit early.	Payqa huk chhikantan temprano karqan.
Do what you want, when you want.	Munasqaykita ruway, munasqayki pacha.
He doesn’t really want that.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa munan.
There’s one last thing.	Huk qhepa kaqmi kan.
They seem awesome.	Paykunaqa manchay hinam kanku.
But this wasn’t unique.	Ichaqa kayqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
I need help with something.	Imapipas yanapayta necesitasaq.
You knew that’s it.	Chayta yacharqanki.
I mean, we can't go now.	Niyta munani, kunanqa manam riyta atichwanchu.
They want you to be sad.	Paykunaqa munanku llakisqa kanaykita.
I hear you’re good.	Uyarini allin kasqaykita.
More days passed.	Aswan punchawmi pasarqa.
It’s a really good one.	Chiqamanta allin kaq.
Of course, there are other things.	Arí, huk imakunatapas kanmi.
I’m proud, you know.	Orgulloso kani, yachanki.
Go tell someone.	Riy pimanpas willay.
He left it there.	Chaypim saqirqa.
This is what they want.	Kaytam munanku.
But he wasn’t alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
With that, he went out.	Chayta nispas lluqsirqa.
He looked tired and sad.	Payqa sayk’usqa, llakisqa ima qhawarisqa.
I wanted to be alone.	Sapallan kaytam munarqani.
I just want to be together properly for once.	Huk kutilla allinta kuska kayta munani.
Now there's one every other day.	Kunanqa sapa iskay p'unchawmi huk kan.
This is fairly obvious.	Kayqa allin sut’inmi.
It’s not good for some reason.	Imaraykupas mana allinchu.
Now he wants to talk.	Kunanqa rimayta munan.
But it is better to act quickly.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman usqhaylla ruwayqa.
Not quite, but almost.	Mana allintachu, aswanpas yaqa.
And that’s what it is.	Hinaspa chaymi chay.
I thought this was a good thing.	Kayqa allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
I knew this very well.	Kaytaqa allintam yacharqani.
I can’t have another opinion.	Manam huk yuyayniyuq kayta atiymanchu.
That would never be a bad thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas huk mana allinchu kanman.
They were unlucky.	Paykunaqa mana suerteyoqmi karqanku.
Tomorrow night, it could be a new moon.	Paqarin tuta, musuq killa kanman.
He looked very upset about something.	Payqa imamantapas anchata phiñasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
The first step is the most difficult.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwayqa aswan sasa ruwaymi.
Or it was something.	Utaq imapas karqa.
If anything he looked almost happy.	Sichus imapas yaqa kusisqa qhawarisqa.
Clearly, though, this is not the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana chay hinachu kasqanta.
He didn’t think it would be the last.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chay qhepa kaq kananta.
He was very sure.	Payqa ancha segurom karqa.
So I didn’t want to be here.	Chaymi mana kaypi kayta munarqanichu.
That is never a good thing.	Chayqa manam haykapipas allinchu.
But that would take all day.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa tukuy p’unchaymi kanman.
There just wasn’t time.	Chaylla mana tiempo karqachu.
He doesn't seem to want to talk.	Payqa manapaschá rimayta munanchu hina.
I hope it's not too bad.	Suyachkani mana ancha mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
Twenty hours there, twenty hours ago.	Iskay chunka hora chaypi, iskay chunka hora ñawpaq.
I want to find him.	Payta tariyta munani.
So it had to be something else.	Chaymi huk imapas kanan karqa.
Nobody cares anymore.	Manañam pipas imananpaschu.
I didn’t expect it to be that big.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna hatun kananta.
I don’t want him to know.	Manam munanichu yachananta.
One, one, one.	Huk, huk, huk.
He really wanted to be.	Payqa anchatan kayta munarqan.
They are all busy.	Llapallankum ocupasqa kachkanku.
It was stupid and foolish.	Chayqa sonso, mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I’m sure no one has any idea.	Seguro kani mana pipas yuyayniyuq.
Being sick is not all bad.	Unqusqa kayqa manam tukuy mana allinchu.
You know, you finally learned how to do that.	Yachanki, chayta ruwaytaqa tukukuypi yacharqanki.
I hear those things, all right.	Chaykunataqa uyarini, allinmi.
This is a unique one.	Kayqa sapallanmi.
It looks very interesting.	Ancha munaymanmi rikchakun.
I didn’t realize it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan repararqanichu.
I thought you were sick.	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim unqusqa kasqaykita.
And yes, they are here.	Hinaspa arí, kaypi kachkanku.
Sure, that’s what he said.	Seguro, chaytan nisqa.
Everything was there.	Tukuy imapas chaypi kaqmi karqa.
There, that was the truth.	Chaypin, chaymi cheqaq kaq karqan.
It’s very hard to tell anything.	Ancha sasam imapas willayta.
I am just as upset as you are.	Ñuqapas qam hinam llakisqa kachkani.
The latter, however, may be more interesting.	Kay qhepa kaqmi ichaqa aswan sumaq kanman.
Other than that, you’ll be fine.	Huk chaymanta, allinmi kanki.
He’s really nice in that.	Payqa chaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.
But for some reason you can’t.	Ichaqa imaraykupas manan atiwaqchu.
But he was such a man.	Ichaqa chayna runam karqa.
I mean, it's one, anyway.	Niyta munani, hukninmi, imayna kaptinpas.
So happy for him.	Chayna kusisqa paypaq.
It seems irrelevant here.	Kaypiqa mana imapaqpas kanman hinam.
So he didn’t say much.	Chaymi payqa mana anchatachu rimarqan.
This guy is a tough, tough player.	Kay runaqa sinchi, sinchi pukllaqmi.
We did well here.	Kaypiqa allintam ruwarqayku.
And now there was no one.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña pipas karqanchu.
We are fine there.	Chaypiqa allinmi kachkaniku.
He wasn’t childlike at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas wawa hinachu karqan.
No matter who it is.	Pipas kaptinpas.
One of the things was more mysterious.	Huknin imapas aswan pakasqa kaqmi karqa.
I am a human being.	Runa runam kani.
I am very unhappy.	Ancha mana kusisqam kachkani.
They want to be good, they want to be great.	Allin kaytam munanku, hatun kaytam munanku.
I want to be a good person.	Allin runa kaytam munani.
I'll do it a few hours early.	Iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwasaq.
This is doubly bad.	Kayqa iskay kutita mana allinchu.
So again, it’s.	Chaymi yapamanta.
He said that to me in the car.	Chaynatam niwarqa carropi.
Learn how to think.	Imayna yuyaymanayta yachay.
He knows he’s thinking seriously about this.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi allinta yuyaykusqanmanta.
There are three, he said.	Kimsa kan, nispa.
It’s ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam.
Unless someone else is known.	Mana chayqa huk runa riqsisqa kaptinqa.
Nothing, not even anyone.	Mana imapas, nitaq pipas.
He's actually second.	Payqa chiqaptaqa iskay kaqmi.
In a completely different way.	Huk chikan chikan ruwaypi.
It’s always cold.	Sapa kutim chiri.
I didn’t want to know anymore.	Manañam yachayta munarqanichu.
Maybe it will do well.	Ichapas allinta ruwanman.
He was like a child.	Payqa wawa hina kasharqan.
But the truth is, they are not.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, manan chay hinachu kanku.
Where it was located.	Maypi tarikurqa.
But it does nothing with it.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa imatapas ruwanchu.
You can certainly do that if you want to.	Munaspaqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwawaq.
Okay, maybe not that much.	Allinmi, ichapas mana chaynatachu.
I was always a teacher.	Sapa kutim yachachiq kani.
Really, really excited.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta kusisqa.
You’re right there.	Qamqa chaypim kachkanki.
But it was you .	Ichaqa qanmi karqanki .
Next year, maybe, maybe not.	Hamuq wata, ichapas, manapaschá.
You want to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwayta munanki.
He was happy with that.	Chaywanmi payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
He is the truth.	Payqa cheqaq kaqmi.
I didn’t know what to do here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi imata ruwanayta.
That would be a bad thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin ruwaymi kanman.
He began to think about the future.	Payqa hamuq tiempopi yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa.
And, sure, it’s all good.	Hinaspa, seguro, tukuy imapas allinmi.
But they are still not sure.	Ichaqa manaraqmi segurochu kanku.
But the worst part was that night.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinqa karqan chay tutan.
It is ridiculously wrong.	Asikunapaq hinam pantasqa kachkan.
That can be very difficult to do.	Chaytaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi kanman.
One was once young.	Hukninmi huk kutilla wayna karqan.
Surprisingly, it sounds so simple.	Admirakuypaqmi, ancha facilmi uyarikun.
And that’s all he thought about.	Hinaspa chaymi llapan yuyaykusqanmanta.
But so far this is not the case.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan chay hinachu.
I never feel safe.	Manam haykapipas segurochu tarikuni.
And if he doesn’t.	Hinaspa mana ruwaptinqa.
Don't get tired of it.	Ama chaywanqa sayk'usqa kaychu.
I really want to catch it.	Anchatam munani hapiyta.
Now he knew better.	Kunanqa allintam yacharqa.
I know you want me to talk more about it.	Yachanim chaymanta astawan rimanaypaq munasqaykita.
I didn’t hear it very well.	Manam ancha allintachu uyarirqani.
No one else though.	Mana pipas huk ichaqa.
It’s such a crazy thing.	Chayna loco kaqmi.
It looks like a nice restaurant.	Sumaq mikhuy wasiman rikch’akun.
The people are here.	Runakunaqa kaypim kachkan.
It's an hour early.	Huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi kachkan.
Repeat these steps a few times.	Kay ruwaykunata iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
You want to prevent that from happening.	Chayna kananpaqmi harkayta munanki.
That’s how I know about him.	Chaynatam paymanta yachani.
I really don't want to be alone now.	Chiqaptaqa manam kunanqa sapallay kayta munanichu.
No one wants to live there.	Manan pipas chaypi tiyayta munanchu.
As an adult.	Kuraq runa hina.
Sure, he was terrified.	Seguro, payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
Nobody had to do it.	Manan pipas ruwananchu karqan.
That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
It could have been almost anything.	Yaqa imapas kanman karqa.
Too much, too good.	Ancha achka, ancha allin.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munarqanichu.
What am I going to do? 	¿Imatataq ruwasaq?
He would be here anyway.	Payqa kaypi kanman imayna kaptinpas.
Why is that???.	¿Imaraykutaq chayna???.
But I didn’t think it would be this soon.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu kay usqhaylla kananta.
It would be nice, but it’s not enough.	Allinmi kanman, ichaqa manan chayllachu.
Know exactly where you are at all times.	Tukuy tiempo maypi kasqaykita allinta yachay.
He left injured that night.	Chay tutan k’irisqa ripurqan.
I don’t want to talk about anything like that.	Manam chayna imamantapas rimayta munanichu.
That’s good, good.	Chay allinmi, allinmi.
I think you’ll be happy.	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kanki.
I want to see it very badly.	Ancha mana allintam qawayta munani.
And then came the worst.	Hinaspa chaymanta hamurqan aswan mana allin kaq.
Please, please, please .	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa .
We had to do it every day every day.	Sapa punchawmi sapa punchaw ruwanayku karqa.
I want to be wrong.	Pantasqa kaytam munani.
It’s more difficult than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan sasa.
The worst of the night.	Tutamanta aswan mana allin.
I’ve been there a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kashani.
I really thought it would be good.	Chiqaptam piensarqani allin kananta.
Almost a man.	Yaqa huk runa.
This is a real thing.	Kayqa chiqap imapas.
If so, this was it.	Chayna kaptinqa kaymi karqa.
I sure am sorry about that.	Seguro llakikuni chaymanta.
This will be more interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi kanqa.
I really didn’t know what to do with it.	Chiqamanta mana yacharqanichu chaywan imata ruwanayta.
I think that’s what it means.	Chaytan niyta munan, nispan yuyaykuni.
Something real and familiar.	Imapas chiqap hinaspa riqsisqa.
That makes the story even more interesting.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi chay willakuyta.
It just doesn't work.	Chayllam mana allintachu ruwan.
It just seems ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinallam rikchakun.
Couldn't ride a bike.	Mana bicicletapi puriyta atirqachu.
I didn’t see it happen.	Manam rikurqanichu chay pasananta.
I don’t know how young I was.	Manam yachanichu imayna wayna kasqaymanta.
This can't be such a bad thing.	Kayqa manam chayna mana allinchu kanman.
I didn’t always hear it.	Manam sapa kutichu uyarirqani.
Something more important.	Imapas aswan importante kaq.
That’s the important thing, to build a new building.	Chayqa importante kaqmi, mosoq wasi ruwanapaq.
It’s not really that hard.	Manam chiqaptaqa chayna sasachu.
It was a little crazy.	Huk chikan loco karqan.
Everyone's tired and hungry.	Lliwmi sayk'usqa, yarqasqa ima.
Very, very fast.	Ancha, ancha utqaylla.
It used to be great.	Ñawpaqtaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I’m this guy.	Ñuqaqa kaymi kani.
Maybe tonight will be the second time?.	Ichapas kunan tuta iskay kaq kuti kanqa?.
We need to make it bigger.	Chaytaqa aswan hatunmi ruwananchik.
I know he’s not happy with me anymore.	Yachanin manaña ñoqawan kusisqachu kashasqanmanta.
Don’t do that!.	¡Ama chayta ruwaychu!.
Which sounds good.	Imataq allin uyarikun.
I have something to tell you one day.	Huk punchawmi imatapas willanaypaq kachkan.
I really really do.	Chiqaptam chiqaptapuni ruwani.
I don’t remember him at all.	Manam paytaqa ni imapipas yuyarinichu.
He declined to comment earlier.	Payqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rimayta munarqanchu.
Again, not good enough.	Yapamanta, mana allinchu.
It was really important.	Cheqaqtapunin ancha importante karqan.
I can’t be like that.	Manam chayna kayta atiymanchu.
I wanted to play more.	Astawan pukllayta munarqani.
But he said it over and over again.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi nisqa.
That’s why he’s sick.	Chayraykum unqusqa kachkan.
He knew they weren’t.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kasqankuta.
No, maybe not the best.	Manan, ichapas mana aswan allinchu.
But someone had to do it.	Ichaqa pipas ruwanan karqan.
As usual, it’s.	Sapa kuti hina.
Now he always seemed sad.	Kunanqa sapa kutim llakisqa hina karqa.
But he didn’t really talk about it.	Ichaqa manan chaymantaqa allintachu rimarqan.
Now he looked sad.	Kunanqa llakisqa qhawarisqa.
There goes your last wish.	Chaypin rin qhepa munasqayki.
Like you, really.	Imayna qam hina, chiqaptapuni.
He may not do that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
The next step was better.	Qatiqnin ruwayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
He was a house man.	Wasi runa kasqa.
It’s not that hard, after all.	Manan chay hina sasachu, tukuy imamanta.
I didn’t want to believe him.	Manam paytaqa creeyta munarqanichu.
They seem unimpressed.	Mana admirasqa hinam kanku.
There were many such.	Achka chayna karqa.
They want to do better.	Paykunaqa aswan allinta ruwayta munanku.
They were always busy.	Paykunaqa sapa kutillanmi ocupasqa karqanku.
It’s not the worst.	Manan aswan mana allinchu.
You can't leave now.	Kunanqa manam ripuyta atiwaqchu.
I can't find another word.	Manam huk rimayta tarinichu.
I don’t want to make much of it.	Manam anchatachu chaymanta ruwayta munani.
The first is the most common.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan riqsisqa.
Very nice, very nice.	Ancha sumaq, ancha sumaq.
He did things on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi imatapas ruwaq.
We had a party.	Huk fiestata ruwarqayku.
But he knows it well.	Ichaqa allintan chayta yachan.
He loves to work hard.	Payqa anchatam llamkayta munan.
It would be the only human thing to do.	Chaylla runa hina ruwaymi kanman.
He always knew what she was thinking.	Payqa sapa kutim yacharqa ima piensasqanmanta.
I smoked a cigarette.	Huk cigarrota pitaq kani.
They want to be there.	Paykunaqa chaypi kaytam munanku.
But we weren’t very successful.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu allinta ruwarqayku.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun kayqa.
Not quite yet, at least.	Manaraqmi allintachu, aswanpas.
This is obviously always the case.	Kayqa sut’inmi sapa kutilla.
I didn’t see anything, really.	Mana imatapas rikurqanichu, chiqaptaqa.
I saw him twice.	Iskay kutitam payta rikurqani.
I didn’t have a very high opinion of his intelligence.	Manam ancha hatun yuyayniyuqchu karqani yachaysapa kasqanmanta.
What, who knows.	Ima, pi yachan.
I sure didn’t do that.	Seguro mana chayta ruwarqanichu.
I made my way into town.	Llaqtamanmi ñanta ruwarqani.
However, this is not a very effective approach.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu.
It was like that, he knew.	Chay hina kasqa, payqa yacharqanmi.
He couldn't say why.	Manam niyta atirqachu imarayku.
I’m just right there.	Ñuqaqa chayllam kachkani.
But soon that will be no more.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan chayqa manaña kanqachu.
She didn't know what he was thinking.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
Maybe you’ll do the same.	Ichapas qampas chayta ruwanki.
But by no means is that enough.	Ichaqa manan imaraykupas chayllachu.
It just happened, that's all.	Chayllaraqmi pasarqa, chayllam.
You can't do that anywhere else.	Chaytaqa manam maypipas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But nothing like this.	Ichaqa manan imapas kay hinaqa.
This was a few nights ago.	Kayqa iskay kimsa tuta ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
There are many such that.	Kanmi achka chayna chay.
But if it has to be, it has to be.	Ichaqa sichus chay hina kanan chayqa, chay hina kanan.
But it’s nice so it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa sumaqmi chaymi mana imananpaschu.
He wasn’t like anyone else.	Payqa manan huk hinachu karqan.
Everything was so amazing.	Tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It was supposed to be me.	Ñuqam kanan karqa.
This makes sense, but it’s hard to do.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi, ichaqa sasa ruwaymi.
It’s actually quite interesting to do.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi ruwayqa.
Yes, one is useless without the other.	Arí, hukninmi mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​huknin mana kaptinqa.
You don’t have to do something you don’t have to do.	Manan mana ruwanaykipaq hinachu ruwanayki.
He stayed home as long as he could.	Atisqanman hina wasipi qhepakurqan.
It was a good year!.	¡Allin wata karqan!.
But I learned a lot.	Ichaqa achkatam yacharqani.
In fact, the sooner you learn how to do it, the better.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan utqaylla chay ruwayta yachanki chayqa, aswan allinmi.
I doubt if it ever will be.	Iskayrayani sichus hayk’aqllapas kanqa chayta.
This was nowhere near him.	Kayqa manam karqachu maypipas paytaqa.
So far it makes no sense.	Kunankamaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I can’t see the way.	Manam ñanta rikunichu.
If anything, it’s worse.	Sichus imapas kanman chayqa, aswan mana allinmi.
I need someone here.	Kaypi pitapas necesitasaq.
But then there will be safety.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa kanqa seguro kaymi.
Maybe half of it.	Ichapas chaymanta kuskan.
Not if it’s.	Manam sichus.
About being older.	Kuraq kaymanta.
They were ridiculous.	Paykunaqa asikunapaq hinam karqaku.
It was like two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaq hinam karqa.
I mean, it’s okay .	Ñuqaqa, allinmi .
But he is alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi.
Therefore, it is best to do it on your own.	Chayraykum allin kanman sapallayki ruwanayki.
He couldn’t answer or work on anything.	Payqa manan kutichiyta atirqanchu nitaq imapipas llank’ayta atirqanchu.
He was worried all night.	Tukuy tutan llakisqa kasharqan.
I look forward to better results.	Aswan allin ruwaykunata suyachkani.
He was eager to learn more.	Payqa anchatam munarqa astawan yachayta.
If not please let me know.	Mana chayqa ama hina kaspa willaway.
I know what he fears.	Yachanim ima manchakusqanmanta.
Funniest thing ever.	Aswan asikunapaq kaq imapas haykapipas.
Eventually, you do something.	Qhepamanmi ichaqa imatapas ruwanki.
I was actually happy to talk to him.	Chiqaptaqa kusisqam karqani paywan rimanaypaq.
I want to believe it will help him.	Creeyta munani payta yanapananta.
Anyway, this feature seems to work.	Imayna kaptinpas, kay ruwayqa allinmi rikchakun.
Maybe you don’t know it’s such a problem.	Ichapas mana yachankichu chayna sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
They were huge.	Paykunaqa hatun hatunmi karqaku.
He was a crazy man.	Loco runam karqa.
Playing with me, they were.	Ñoqawan pukllaq, paykunaqa karqanku.
This is how it felt.	Kay hinam tarikurqa.
Tom couldn't wait.	Tomqa manam suyayta atirqachu.
Now he’s angry and frustrated.	Kunanqa phiñasqa, hukmanyasqa ima.
Why yes, yes it does.	Imaraykutaq arí, arí chayta ruwan.
I plan to do that tomorrow.	Paqarin chayta ruwayta yuyaykuni.
It would have been him.	Paymi kanman karqan.
No secrets in this house.	Mana pakasqa kay wasipi.
No one wants that to happen.	Manam pipas munanchu chayna kananta.
Clearly this was not the case.	Sut’inmi kashan mana chay hinachu karqan.
And then there’s food.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanmi mikhuy.
John, that was me.	Juan, chaymi ñuqa karqani.
I knew the consequences.	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna kananta.
Now here is where the evil lies.	Kunanqa kaypim mana allinqa kachkan.
An hour passed.	Huk hora pasarqa.
It doesn’t do anything at all.	Manam imatapas ruwanchu ni imapipas.
I feel so much.	Anchatam sientekuni.
I couldn’t not do it.	Manam mana ruwayta atirqanichu.
It’s hidden from everything.	Tukuy imamanta pakasqa kachkan.
He’s sick of it.	Payqa chaywan unqusqa.
He says yes to it.	Payqa arí nin.
Yes, they were busy.	Arí, paykunaqa ocupasqa karqanku.
Everything about him seemed so possessed.	Paymanta tukuy imapas chayna hapisqa hinam karqa.
But that's all there is to it.	Ichaqa chayllam chaypiqa kachkan.
More than one celebrity, really.	Aswan huk riqsisqa, chiqap.
No one here knows how to do it.	Kaypiqa manam pipas ruwayta yachanchu.
And what’s it all about.	Hinaspa imamantataq tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
Now that’s a thing of the past.	Kunanqa chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
He was the man.	Payqa chay runan karqan.
Rather, this person is meant to be human.	Aswanpas kay runaqa runa kananpaqmi.
I can say this.	Kayta niyta atiyman.
In a prison cell.	Huk carcelpi.
I didn’t want to deal with it.	Chaywanqa manam atipayta munarqanichu.
He knew he needed help.	Payqa yacharqanmi yanapayta necesitasqanmanta.
Everyone wants to answer.	Lliwmi munanku kutichiyta.
Not a human being.	Mana runa.
So, that was it.	Chaymi, chaymi karqa.
Tell me the story, please.	Chay willakuyta willaway, nispa.
This will always happen.	Kayqa sapa kutillanmi kanqa.
But it certainly didn’t work out.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu karqan.
He did it all the time in high school.	Payqa sapa kutim colegiopi chayta ruwaq.
I don’t see a big deal.	Manam hatun ruwaytaqa rikunichu.
He can't be arrested.	Payqa manan hap'isqa kayta atinmanchu.
He wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chaymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Not much there is.	Mana anchatachu chaypiqa.
And finally.	Hinaspa tukukuypi.
Maybe he’s smarter.	Ichapas pay aswan yachaysapa.
This is the last one, man.	Kaymi qhipa kaq, runa.
Now is the reality.	Kunanmi chiqap kaq.
It’s sad, but it’s safer.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa aswan seguro.
That’s the stupid thing.	Chayqa sonso kaqmi.
Be more secure like this.	Aswan seguro kay hina.
Something about the city.	Imapas llaqtamanta.
I feel tired and exhausted.	Sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa ima sientekuni.
I don't know how to answer that.	Chaytaqa manam imayna kutichiyta yachanichu.
But no, he wanted to wait.	Ichaqa manan, suyayta munarqan.
They are not like people here.	Paykunaqa manan runakuna hinachu kaypi.
So he stayed with me.	Chaymi payqa ñoqawan qhepakurqan.
Nothing like that existed before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imapas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
He was under arrest.	Payqa hap’isqa kasharqan.
It would be foolish not to do so.	Mana chayta ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kanman.
I seem to be disappointed.	Hukmanyasqa hinam kani.
You're not ready.	Manam listochu kachkanki.
It was almost funny, but not quite.	Yaqa asikunapaq hinam karqa, ichaqa manam allintachu.
Not worth the chance to do it at home.	Mana valenchu ​​wasipi ruwanapaq chansa.
This is what we need to do.	Kaymi imatapas ruwananchikpaq.
Not alone, alone.	Mana sapallanchu, sapallan.
If it was good, great.	Sichus allin karqan chayqa, ancha allinmi.
So, act fast.	Chaymi, usqhaylla ruway.
He wasn’t like that, though.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan, ichaqa.
Maybe it was too much.	Ichapas llumpay karqa.
That was the best moment.	Chayqa aswan allin kaq rato karqan.
To find out where he was going and why.	Mayman risqanmanta, imarayku risqanmanta yachananpaq.
He never did, and probably never will.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu, manapaschá hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
We all did it together.	Llapanchismi chaytaqa kuska ruwarqayku.
I always wanted to do something.	Sapa kutillanmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
He was all that mattered.	Paymi tukuy imapas importante karqan.
It went on for about a year.	Yaqa huk wata hinam chayna karqa.
You, with me.	Qam, ñuqawan.
It’s really no big deal.	Chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu.
Bad or good.	Mana allinta utaq allinta.
I’m sure he’ll be back later.	Seguro kani qhepaman kutimunanta.
Maybe, but probably not.	Ichapas, ichaqa manapaschá.
So it’s about being tired.	Chaymi sayk’usqa kaymanta.
He is here, the man of the night.	Payqa kaypi kachkan, chay tutamanta kaq runa.
No one is happy, but no one can do anything about it.	Manan pipas kusisqachu, ichaqa manan pipas imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
I think that’s all he’ll do.	Chaylla ruwananta yuyaykuni.
I should be very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kanay.
I know it is not easy.	Yachanim mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
He was disappointed.	Chaywanmi hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
I don’t like him.	Manam paytaqa gustawanchu.
So beyond all the newness.	Chaymi tukuy musuq kaymanta hawaman.
I wasn’t there, after all.	Manam chaypichu karqani, tukuy imamanta.
He may never do that.	Payqa manapaschá hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
He is not alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu.
Many days, he said.	Achka punchawmi, nispa.
And he got the last job.	Hinaspa qhepa llank’ayta chaskirqan.
That could be all night.	Chayqa tukuy tutan kanman.
It can do two things here.	Kaypiqa iskay ruwaykunata ruwayta atin.
He stayed there for about a year.	Chaypin yaqa huk wata qhepakurqan.
He was terrified at night.	Payqa tutan mancharisqa kasharqan.
That uncertainty is unique.	Chay mana seguro kayqa manan chay hinaqa kanchu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Chaypiqa manam imapas mana allinqa kanchu.
Of course, you might want to do that, but anyway.	Ichaqa, ichapas chayta ruwayta munanki, ichaqa imayna kaptinpas.
Everyone was sad and happy.	Lliwmi llakisqa hinaspa kusisqa karqaku.
You're going home.	Wasiman rinki.
They are all together all the time.	Llapallankum tukuy tiempo kuska kachkanku.
It sounds very funny.	Ancha asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
Never mind anything.	Mana hayk’aqpas imapas.
What a wonderful idea she has.	Ima sumaq yuyayniyuqmi payqa.
He doesn't want to hear that.	Chaytaqa manam uyariyta munanchu.
Better than this, he’s a great teacher.	Kaymanta aswan allinqa, payqa hatun yachachiqmi.
He always had his way.	Payqa sapa kutim imayna munasqanman hina karqa.
But after that moment, it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa chay rato qhepamanmi mana imananpaschu.
I really want to talk about this.	Kaymanta rimayta anchata munani.
That was a very easy thing to do.	Chayqa ancha facil ruwaymi karqa.
It could have been anyone, anywhere.	Pipas, maypipas kanman karqan.
He said there was nothing wrong.	Paymi nirqa mana imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
People are foolish everywhere.	Runakunaqa maypipas mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
That’s just like him.	Chayqa pay hinallam.
These are the latter.	Kaykunaqa qhepa kaqmi.
That is not that difficult.	Chayqa manam chayna sasachu.
What else would be wrong?.	¿Imataq huk mana allin kanman?.
I want to walk too.	Ñuqapas puriyta munani.
Actually he did well.	Chiqaptaqa allintam ruwarqa.
Extremely unpopular.	Sinchi mana allin qhawarisqa.
He doesn’t want to hold anything back.	Payqa manan imatapas hark’ayta munanchu.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Achka ruwaymi kachkan.
This was as tough as the last.	Kayqa qhipa kaq hina sinchi sasa karqan.
It wasn’t good anywhere.	Mana maypipas allinchu karqa.
I'll do it later.	Qhepamanmi ruwasaq.
He knew a lot.	Payqa achkatam yacharqa.
That would be more interesting.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi kanman.
I think he is in trouble.	Sasachakuypi kasqanmantam piensani.
Probably never.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas.
How and why is difficult to determine.	Imaynata hinaspa imanasqa kasqanmantam sasa yachay.
Performance usually does.	Ruwayqa yaqa llapanpim ruwan.
So, it had to be that one.	Chaymi, chay huknin kanan karqa.
Very nicely said.	Ancha sumaq nisqa.
It was the way he wanted it.	Imayna munasqanman hinam karqa.
I suspect maybe you do.	Sospechani ichapas chayta ruwanki.
It would be good there.	Chaypiqa allinmi kanman.
That was last night.	Chayqa qayna tutam karqa.
What a misconduct.	Ima mana allin ruwaymi.
Privacy and outdoors at school.	Yachay wasipi sapallay hinaspa hawapi kay.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmanta.
I know exactly what it is.	Allintam yachani ima kasqanmanta.
But the good thing.	Ichaqa allin kaq.
He is not unhappy.	Payqa manan mana kusisqachu kashan.
I would love to take the job.	Anchatam munani chay llamkayta hapiyta.
He was nobody at the time.	Payqa chay tiempopiqa mana pipas karqanchu.
So it had to be.	Chaymi kanan karqa.
It’s a big deal here.	Kaypiqa hatunmi.
I wasn’t happy to say the least.	Manam kusisqachu karqani niyta.
The biggest one? 	¿Hatun kaq?
He seemed genuinely concerned.	Payqa chiqap llakisqa hinam karqa.
I just did those things.	Chaykunataqa chayllaraqmi ruwarqani.
I plan to be there.	Chaypi kaytam yuyaykuni.
If he did well, well and good.	Sichus allinta ruwarqa chayqa, allinmi hinaspa allin.
This is a beautiful evening.	Kayqa sumaq chisi.
I didn't think he would, no.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna ruwananta, manam.
And he’s excited, he’s nervous.	Hinaspa payqa kusisqa kachkan, mancharisqa kachkan.
Do it, please.	Ruway, ama hina kaspa.
I heard it twice.	Iskay kutitam uyarirqani.
The evacuees were devastated.	Chay qarqusqa runakunaqa anchatam llakisqa karqaku.
Very stupid, very bad.	Ancha sonso, ancha mana allin.
He doesn't want to talk.	Payqa manam rimayta munanchu.
It was a dress, sort of.	Chayqa karqan huk p’acha, huk laya.
All together now.	Tukuy kuska kunan.
He knew it all along.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chaytaqa yacharqan.
He knows it well enough.	Payqa allintam yachan.
Difficult and confusing like this.	Kay hina sasa hinaspa pantasqa.
No one is disagreeing.	Manan pipas mana acuerdopichu kashan.
It’s a morning.	Huk paqarinmi.
Unlike the first one.	Mana ñawpaq kaq hinachu.
I was everything.	Ñuqaqa tukuy imapas karqani.
But maybe it was that good.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna allin karqa.
I think that's crazy.	Chayqa loco kasqanmantam piensani.
So probably not anymore.	Chaymi yaqapaschá manaña.
Pretend it’s no big deal.	Mana hatun ruwaychu hina ruway.
A good teacher.	Allin yachachiq.
He really wanted out.	Payqa chiqaptam lluqsiyta munarqa.
This would be a good thing, but probably not.	Kayqa allinmi kanman, ichaqa manapaschá.
Perhaps it was at that time.	Yaqapaschá chay tiempopi karqan.
Everyone is very good.	Lliwmi ancha allin kanku.
I never saw anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas rikurqanichu.
No one knows what that is.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus chay kasqanmantaqa.
But it’s still not good enough.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allinchu.
I didn't do that today.	Kunan punchawqa manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
It happened yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi pasarqa.
No, he couldn’t.	Manan, manan atirqanchu.
You know exactly what that is.	Allintam yachanki chay ima kasqanmanta.
Sure you are.	Seguro qanmi kanki.
It was the one there.	Chaypi kaqmi karqa.
This one went much faster.	Kayqa aswan utqayllam rirqa.
This will have to be done.	Kayqa ruwana kanqa.
He wasn't really as excited about it as everyone else.	Manam chiqaptachu llapa runakuna hina chaywan kusisqa karqa.
There were three people.	Kimsa runakunam karqaku.
I can’t be sure.	Manam segurochu kanman.
You weren’t there that long.	Mana chay unaytachu chaypi karqanki.
But no one wants anyone to really know anything.	Ichaqa manan pipas munanchu pipas cheqaqtapuni imatapas yachananta.
I look forward to finding out who you are.	Suyachkani pi kasqaykita yachayta.
I can’t remember what.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu imata.
I am now the most popular person here.	Kunanqa kaypi aswan riqsisqa runam kani.
You know the way home from here.	Kaymanta wasiman ñanta yachanki.
I just don’t know what.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imamanta.
I just like him ridiculously.	Payqa asikunapaq hinallam gustan.
I hope something new comes along.	Suyachkani imapas musuq hamunanta.
He did a great job at it.	Payqa ancha allintam chaypi ruwarqa.
But not for too long.	Ichaqa ama llumpay unaytachu.
That doesn’t seem to be a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman hina.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu.
That I was so scared.	Anchata mancharisqa kasqaymanta.
He seemed kind of glad to be in jail.	Payqa huk laya kusisqa hinam karqa carcelpi kasqanmanta.
I would be annoyed.	Ñuqaqa phiñasqa kayman.
But this is certainly not true.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kayqa mana cheqaqchu.
But some people may not.	Ichaqa wakin runakunaqa manapaschá.
You’re a good guy.	Qamqa allinmi kanki.
I did it once before.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk kutitam ruwarqani.
But this is anything but simple.	Ichaqa kayqa imapas ichaqa facilmi.
No, he’s not here.	Manan, payqa manan kaypichu kashan.
I do, a lot.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, anchata.
He said it wasn’t true.	Payqa nirqanmi mana cheqaqchu kasqanmanta.
No he wasn’t.	Manan payqa manan karqanchu.
Now this is .	Kunanqa kayta .
Make it act differently.	Huk hina ruwananpaq ruway.
This undermines a good job.	Chaywanmi allin llamkayta mana allintachu ruwan.
But one last thing.	Ichaqa huk qhepa kaq imapas.
Some people sure want to make it funny.	Wakin runakunaqa seguro ruwayta munanku asikunapaq hina.
Don't ever.	Ama hayk'aqpas.
Two weeks today.	Iskay semana kunan punchaw.
He's right that it won't be easy.	Payqa allintam nin mana facilchu kanqa nispa.
He is included there.	Payqa chaypim churasqa kachkan.
He is a real person.	Payqa cheqaq runan.
And thank you, after all.	Hinaspa gracias, tukuy imamanta.
It is still there today.	Kunankamapas chaypim kachkan.
I don’t know his full name.	Manam tukuy sutinta yachanichu.
I had to redo it twice.	Iskay kutitam yapamanta ruwanay karqa.
However, yesterday was a good day for me.	Ichaqa, qayna punchawmi allin punchaw karqa ñuqapaq.
Please, please go.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa riy.
He died a short time later.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan wañupurqan.
I can't figure out the problem.	Manam chay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta atinichu.
It wasn’t there yesterday.	Manam qayna punchawqa karqachu.
I don't know what he means by that.	Manam yachanichu chaywan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
But what a tragedy for him.	Ichaqa ima llakikuypaqmi paypaq ruwasqanqa.
Really, really hard.	Chiqap, chiqap sasachakuy.
Do what you know to be true.	Cheqaq kasqanmanta yachasqaykita ruway.
Something better always came.	Imapas aswan allinqa sapa kutim hamurqa.
Even if everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allin hina kaptinpas.
But he really shouldn’t have done it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana ruwananchu karqan.
But he doesn’t seem unhappy.	Ichaqa manan mana kusisqachu rikch’akun.
It was supposed to be really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi kanan karqa.
But you are one of them.	Ichaqa hukninmi kanki.
Ask him to speak.	Rimananpaq niy.
I'm happy with how it turned out, really.	Kusisqam kachkani imayna kasqanmanta, chiqaptapuni.
It’s a tough thing to do.	Sinchi ruwaymi.
Instead of	Aswanpas .
This is not like the one above.	Kayqa manan hawapi kaq hinachu.
That is what an adult should do.	Chaytan kuraq runaqa ruwanan.
Actually, it was good.	Chiqaptaqa, allinmi karqa.
Every morning, at least.	Sapa paqarin, aswanpas.
He seemed terribly upset.	Payqa manchay llakisqa hinam karqa.
He was terrified.	Payqa sinchitan mancharisqa kasharqan.
However, in the present	Ichaqa, kunan tiempopi .
He knew this wasn't good for him.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa mana paypaq allinchu kasqanmanta.
And they were accordingly.	Hinan chayman hina karqanku.
You learned something new.	Musuq kaqta yacharqanki.
He will be happy with me.	Payqa ñoqawanmi kusisqa kanqa.
That wasn’t always to be, however.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu kanan karqan ichaqa.
Multiple steps are often required.	Sapa kutim achka ruwaykunata ruwana.
There has to be one somewhere.	Maypipas hukninmi kanan.
No idea what’s important.	Mana yuyayniyuq imachus importante kasqanmanta.
You have no idea where you are.	Mana ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki maypi kasqaykita.
I hope it’s better now.	Suyachkani kunan aswan allin kananpaq.
Like a real person.	Chiqap runa hina.
He’d do something a bit different.	Payqa huk chikan imatapas ruwanman.
But he really knows what he wants.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin yachan ima munasqanta.
She’s a busy, busy girl.	Payqa ocupasqa, ocupasqa sipasmi.
I can't figure out how to do this.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
I can't believe that.	Chaypiqa manam creeyta atiymanchu.
You did what you did.	Qanmi ruwasqaykita ruwarqanki.
Perhaps it was him.	Yaqapaschá pay karqan.
He didn’t make the door.	Payqa manan punkuta ruwarqanchu.
He did it right.	Payqa allintan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
But they weren’t happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu karqanku.
So he says, 'It's.	Chaymi payqa nin.
After all, he learned an awful lot.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa manchay achkata yacharqa.
But he had done this before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayna ruwaytaqa ruwarqa.
It was actually harder.	Chiqamanta aswan sinchi karqa.
I don't want to go now.	Kunanqa manam riyta munanichu.
She couldn't understand what he meant.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu ima niyta munasqanmanta.
That way it is safer.	Chay hinaqa aswan segurom.
I never have a mind.	Manam haykapipas yuyayniyuqchu kani.
I really want to know.	Anchatam yachayta munani.
You should do it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruwanayki.
It must be a difficult task.	Sasa ruwaymi kanan.
He was supposed to be.	Paymi kanan karqan.
He died about a year later.	Payqa yaqa huk wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
It used to be very simple.	Ñawpaqtaqa ancha facilmi karqa.
So please, no one has done it before.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa, pipas ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanchu.
But not at all.	Ichaqa manan ni imapipas.
He said he would be in the car.	Carropi kananta nisqa.
They seem serious.	Paykunaqa serio hinam kanku.
That’s probably there.	Chayqa ichapas chaypi kachkan.
I know what you mean.	Yachanim imamanta rimayta munasqaykita.
They are very confused.	Ancha pantasqa yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I’m sorry something went wrong.	Pampachaykuway imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
You know you want to see it.	Yachankim qawayta munasqaykita.
It came along well.	Allintam hamurqa.
This is not a new day.	Kayqa manam musuq punchawchu.
I didn't know that.	Ñuqaqa manam chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi kanman.
I really want to fix this.	Kaytaqa anchatam allichayta munani.
That went on for about two decades.	Chayqa iskay chunka wata hinam pasarqa.
And that was it.	Hinaspa chayna karqa.
I’d like to talk more about it.	Astawan chaymanta rimayta munayman.
He finally took things seriously.	Payqa qhepamanmi imatapas allinpaq qhawarisqa.
He took it twice.	Payqa iskay kutita hap’irqan.
He would really like to see her again.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munanman hukmanta payta rikuyta.
It was like an inhuman being.	Mana runa hinam karqa.
This isn’t the best though.	Kayqa manan aswan allinchu ichaqa.
Something that doesn’t make sense.	Imapas mana yuyayniyuq kaq.
After all, he was a great guy.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa hatun runam karqa.
So far, very happy.	Kunankamaqa, ancha kusisqa.
He would never be the same again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kanman karqan.
So it should be great.	Chaymi hatun kanan.
They always want more.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim aswan achkata munanku.
It’s not a good thing at all.	Manan imapipas allin ruwaychu.
This is going to be very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi kanqa.
A week later he never wanted to see her again.	Huk semana qhepamanmi manaña hayk’aqpas rikuyta munarqanchu.
Maybe not so well, but well.	Ichapas mana chayna allintachu, ichaqa allinta.
He wouldn’t want this.	Payqa manan kayta munanmanchu.
Tell them you’re there.	Chaypi kasqaykita willay.
You want to know if it is.	Chayna kasqanta yachayta munanki.
You’re not happy either.	Qampas mana kusisqachu kanki.
They were there yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi chaypi karqaku.
Now it is here.	Kunanqa kaypim kachkan.
Speaker, it doesn’t matter.	Rimaq, manam imapaqpas valenchu.
Everything was fine there.	Chaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He didn’t mean it.	Payqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
The most terrible.	Aswan manchay.
I always want to be a part of something.	Sapa kutim munani huk ruwaypi kayta.
This would make a confusing statement, of course.	Kayqa huk pantasqa rimayta ruwanman, sut’inmi.
This is the important part.	Kaymi ancha allin kaq.
He can’t ask, he can’t tell, he can’t talk .	Mana tapuyta atinchu, mana willayta atinchu, mana rimayta atinchu .
You can’t stay ahead.	Manan ñawpaqpi qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
Worse, you actually did.	Aswan mana allinqa, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqanki.
He was scared, now, a little scared.	Payqa mancharisqa, kunan, huk chhikanta mancharisqa.
I heard all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta uyarirqani.
I want you to be with me.	Ñoqaqa munani ñoqawan kanaykita.
It didn’t have to be that easy.	Chaypaqqa manan chayllachu kanan karqan.
He knew everything about me.	Payqa tukuy imatam ñuqamanta yacharqa.
However, it doesn’t.	Ichaqa, manan chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I love learning to listen.	Anchatam munani uyariyta yachayta.
I agree that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam acuerdopi kani.
Instead, it got worse.	Aswanpas aswan mana allinmi karqan.
They know he has no name.	Paykunaqa yachanku mana sutiyuq kasqanmanta.
He was very quick.	Payqa ancha utqayllam karqa.
I still couldn't hear anything.	Kunankamapas manam imatapas uyariyta atirqanichu.
He didn’t want other people to know he was here.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kaypi kashasqanmanta huk runakuna yachananta.
But it wasn’t really.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
No it’s not good.	Manam manam allinchu.
Day the way you want it.	Punchaw imayna munasqaykita.
It’s been around for a long time.	Unayñam kachkan.
I catch it there.	Chaypim hapini.
Second, it makes no sense.	Iskay kaq, manam imapaqpas valenchu.
that’s what he needs.	chaytan necesitan.
I certainly can.	Cheqaqtapunin atiyman.
He doesn’t do that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I want to be sick.	Unqusqa kaytam munani.
He wasn’t there before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaypichu karqan.
But he knew it was true.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kasqanmanta.
Probably someone else.	Yaqapaschá huk runa.
But you know that.	Ichaqa chaytan yachanki.
The key to this is action.	Chaypaqqa ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
I will be happy to do these things.	Chaykunataqa kusisqam ruwasaq.
I didn’t want to answer to anyone.	Manam pimanpas kutichiyta munarqanichu.
Do a good job please.	Allin llamkayta ruway ama hina kaspa.
That’s why he was here.	Chayraykum kaypi karqa.
He needs the money.	Qullqita necesitan.
I like all those people.	Tukuy chay runakunaqa gustan.
I didn’t go well.	Mana allintachu rirqani.
So maybe they’re not that good.	Chaymi ichapas mana chayna allinchu kanku.
Not sure how important it is.	Mana segurochu imayna importante kasqanmanta.
He wasn't quite sure.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan.
He kind of lived out there.	Payqa huk laya chay hawapi tiyaq.
He had to do something about it.	Payqa chaymanta imatapas ruwanan karqan.
And that worked out fine.	Hinaspa chayqa allintam lluqsirqa.
First of all, we are human beings.	Ñawpaqtaqa runakunam kanchik.
Everyone is married.	Lliwmi casarasqa kachkanku.
I really hope it helps you.	Chiqamanta suyachkani qampaq yanapananta.
He looked annoyed if anything.	Payqa phiñasqa qhawarisqa sichus imapas karqan chayqa.
I am as happy as I can be.	Atiyman hinam kusisqa kachkani.
Sick all the time.	Tukuy pacha unqusqa.
It was a very bad experience.	Ancha mana allinmi karqan.
Then again, it might not work.	Chaymanta yapamanta, manapaschá allinchu kanman.
I was in the school.	Yachay wasipi karqani.
I couldn’t answer.	Manam kutichiyta atirqanichu.
This whole thing was horribly wrong.	Kay tukuy imapas manchay mana allinchu karqa.
I am still proud of it.	Kunankamapas chaymantam orgulloso kachkani.
He knew a lot about the city.	Payqa anchatam chay llaqtamanta yacharqa.
Everyone here knows that.	Chaytaqa kaypiqa llapallankum yachanku.
I was the one who did it.	Ñuqam chayta ruwaq kani.
But he didn’t know about it.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan yacharqanchu.
But it may have happened.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna pasarqa.
So he might not do that now.	Chaymi kunanqa manapaschá chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
The most terrifying thing.	Aswan manchay kaq.
Two hours later we did it again.	Iskay hora qhepamanmi hukmanta ruwarqayku.
In fact, he was sure he would.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa segurom karqa chayna ruwananmanta.
What does that mean.	Imataq chay niyta munan.
This is the hardest part.	Kaymi aswan sasa ruwayqa.
I’m thinking and thinking about it.	Chaypin yuyaykushani, yuyaykushani ima.
To this house.	Kay wasiman.
And it just happened.	Hinaspa chaylla pasarqa.
This is just me though.	Kayqa ñuqallam ichaqa.
We’re probably hungry.	Yaqapaschá yarqasqa kayku.
Everyone was very talented.	Lliwmi ancha yachaysapa karqaku.
And that’s really hard.	Hinaspa chayqa cheqaqtapunin sasa.
Like, really sick.	Imayna, chiqap unqusqa.
But it’s not entirely true.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapipas cheqaqchu.
He had no reason to find it.	Payqa manan imaraykupas chaytaqa tariyta atirqanchu.
That’s what it should be.	Chayqa kanan.
Nothing, either.	Mana imapas, nitaq.
I always did that.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwaq kani.
Which is kind of funny.	Imataq huk laya asikunapaq hina.
He wasn't sure how he felt about her.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan paymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.
New every year.	Sapa wata musuq.
I’m sorry about everything that’s happened.	Llakikuni tukuy imakuna pasasqanmanta.
They know it’s funny.	Paykunaqa yachanku asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta.
From here though, things were pretty simple.	Kaymanta ichaqa, imapas ancha facilmi karqa.
A girl sometimes goes as far as she can.	Huk sipasmi wakin kuti atisqanman hina rin.
As bad as the other.	Huknin hina mana allin.
Hopefully someone will be wise enough to do it right.	Munaymanmi pipas yachaysapa kayta allinta ruwananta.
But no one said much.	Ichaqa manan pipas anchatachu rimarqan.
It just never seems to work out.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas allintachu ruwanman hina.
He’s not doing that though.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwashan ichaqa.
I can’t find anything.	Manam imatapas tarinichu.
So know what you can do.	Chaymi atisqaykita yachay.
A mystery, really.	Huk pakasqa yachay, chiqap.
No one at all.	Mana pipas ni imapipas.
Being there was easier.	Chaypi kayqa aswan facilmi karqa.
I thought it was true.	Cheqaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
Very, very smart.	Ancha, ancha yachaysapa.
I just had a better idea.	Chayllaraqmi aswan allin yuyayniyuq karqani.
People like you are ridiculous.	Qan hina runakunaqa asikunapaq hinan kanku.
There is no one here at all.	Kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu ni imapipas.
Now, isn’t that interesting.	Kunanqa, ¿manachu chay sumaq.
It will remain a secret, a secret.	Chayqa pakasqa, pakasqa hinallam kanqa.
But he wasn’t human.	Ichaqa manan runa hinachu karqan.
And so, that was it.	Hinaspa chaymi, chay hina karqan.
They are better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi kanku.
Two hours, then.	Iskay hora, chaymanta.
That crazy house.	Chay loco wasi.
It’s such a tough, tough thing.	Chayna sinchi, sinchi kaqmi.
I was soon exhausted.	Pisi tiempollamantan sayk’usqa karqani.
He did very well out there.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa chay hawapi.
But that wasn’t the case this week.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan kay semanapi.
He didn’t want to sleep.	Payqa manan puñuyta munarqanchu.
He was never alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu karqan.
I saw this in action recently.	Kaytaqa chayllaraqmi ruwaypi rikurqani.
That’s a new thing to do.	Chayqa musuq ruwaymi.
The angrier the better.	Aswan phiñasqa kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
He had been in the hospital for almost two years.	Payqa yaqa iskay watañam hospitalpi karqa.
I’m really bad at it.	Chiqap mana allinchu kani chaypi.
We always did that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kayku.
It’s always the same.	Sapa kutillanmi.
That wasn’t what he wanted.	Chayqa mana munasqanman hinachu kasqa.
A true player.	Chiqap pukllaq.
Be a better player.	Aswan allin pukllaq kay.
No one, really, was good.	Manam pipas, chiqaptaqa, allinchu karqa.
Okay, here it is now.	Allinmi, kaypi kunan kachkan.
With it, he could do whatever he wanted.	Chaywanqa munasqanman hinam ruwayta atinman karqa.
I know this will work.	Yachanim kayqa allinta ruwananta.
He would have been great.	Payqa hatunmi kanman karqa.
It really couldn't be easier.	Chiqaptaqa manam aswan facilchu kanman.
So, that happened so fast.	Chaymi, chayna utqaylla chay pasarqa.
There was always a reason.	Sapa kutim imaraykupas karqa.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Chaywanqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
But now everything was fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqan.
He was extremely excited.	Payqa sinchitan kusisqa kasharqan.
He probably wouldn't have wanted that at all.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ni imapipas munanmanchu karqan.
You know where you are.	Yachankim maypi kasqaykita.
He didn’t really act on it.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chayman hina ruwarqan.
Night after night everyone.	Tuta tuta tukuy runa.
But there is nothing, no one.	Ichaqa manan imapas kanchu, manan pipas.
Something about it looked familiar.	Imapas chaymantaqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He is very angry and very frustrated.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa, ancha hukmanyasqa ima kachkan.
But he is the truth.	Ichaqa paymi cheqaq kaq.
Big, very ugly.	Hatun, sinchi millay.
Not much of anything.	Mana ancha imapas.
Faster and better.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan allin.
He looked too scared to speak.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa mana rimananpaq.
This is the best way to do it.	Kayqa aswan allin ruwaymi.
Where are you now?.	¿Maypitaq kunan kachkanki?.
I mean, he’s pretty cool.	Niyta munani, payqa ancha sumaqmi.
You’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki.
Go to the school.	Yachay wasiman riy.
He has to be here.	Payqa kaypi kanan tiyan.
It just happened one day.	Chayllaraqmi huk punchaw pasarqa.
I’m just so excited.	Chayllam ancha kusisqa kachkani.
Maybe next summer.	Ichapas hamuq chiri killapi.
That means losing focus.	Chayqa manaña yuyayniyuq kayta munan.
It would be great insurance.	Hatun seguro kanman.
These were, in fact, a good thing to do.	Kaykunaqa, allin ruwanapaq hinam karqa.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymanta rimayta munarqanchu.
And now he's gone.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña chaypichu kachkan.
That’s something, all right.	Chayqa imapas, allinmi.
He didn't seem disappointed.	Payqa manam hukmanyasqa hinachu karqa.
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Tukuy imapas mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
Surprisingly, this does not seem easy.	Admirakuypaqmi kayqa mana facilchu rikchakun.
That’s not strictly true.	Chayqa manan sinchi cheqaqchu.
He probably had that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá karqan.
A short time ago.	Pisi pacha ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He immediately wished he wouldn't.	Chayllam mana chayta ruwananta munarqa.
Practice mindfulness and presence.	Yuyayniyuq kayta, chaypi kayta ima ruway.
They both want it.	Iskayninkum munanku.
He's probably with her.	Payqa yaqapaschá paywan kachkan.
That has always worked for me.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqapaq allin karqa.
Clearly something was wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
I can’t find it now though.	Kunanqa manan tarinichu ichaqa.
I knew that all along.	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon yacharqani.
He knew exactly where he was.	Payqa allintan yacharqan maypi kashasqanmanta.
This is ambiguous.	Kayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
He would have had to go to town.	Chaypaqqa llaqtamanmi rinan kanman karqan.
But no, that wasn’t true.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
He left everything behind.	Payqa tukuy imatam saqirqa.
Then the other two.	Chaymanta wakin iskay.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
I'm not doing too badly.	Manam ancha mana allintachu ruwachkani.
I thought it was actually great.	Yuyarqanim chiqaptaqa ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Someone had to do something.	Pipas imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He must be tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa kanan.
And this is what everyone wants.	Hinaspa kayta llapa runa munanku.
He did enter the house.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chay wasiman haykurqan.
Why, that sounds absurd.	Imarayku, chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi uyarikun.
I hope it works for you.	Suyachkani qampaq allin kananpaq.
He wouldn’t want to eat anything.	Payqa manan imatapas mikhuyta munanmanchu.
Anything, anyway.	Imapas, imayna kaptinpas.
No, this was the worst.	Manan, kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
He didn’t want to leave.	Mana ripuyta munarqanchu.
How about here.	Imayna kaypi.
There is no point in doing the same work twice.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​iskay kutita chay llamkayta ruwayqa.
It was as bad as anything.	Imapas hinam mana allinchu karqa.
That’s the simple truth.	Chayqa facil cheqaq kaqmi.
That’s the first easy one.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaq facilmi.
But this was easy.	Ichaqa kayqa facilmi karqa.
He had to be ready.	Payqa listo kanan karqan.
This probably happened last month.	Kayqa yaqapaschá qayna killapi pasarqa.
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chaypi kasharqan.
How can it be ugly.	Imaynataq millay kanman.
I know, in fact, that it is not.	Yachanim, chiqaptaqa, mana chayna kasqanmanta.
What’s the answer?.	¿Imaynataq chaymanta?.
Not that day, at least.	Mana chay punchawchu, aswanpas.
If he does.	Sichus pay ruwan.
He knew how important it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruway ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Like, really really.	Imayna, chiqap chiqap.
What can you do to make things better?.	¿Imatan ruwawaq imakunatapas allinta ruwanaykipaq?.
He was going to do this job.	Payqa kay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi karqa.
I don’t know how to do this.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus kayta ruwanaypaq.
It could be me, he says.	Ñuqam kanman, nispas nin.
Not sure what happened.	Mana segurochu imakuna pasasqanmanta.
This was yesterday.	Kayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
I had barely thought of that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá yuyaykurqani.
I want to find my .	Ñuqaqa tariyta munani ñuqapa .
It probably doesn’t exist.	Manapaschá kanchu.
It was a tough three weeks.	Kimsa semanan sinchi sasa karqan.
Actually, it’s easy.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa facilmi.
He has never been happy yet.	Payqa manaraqmi haykapipas kusisqachu kachkan.
It really did, one day here.	Chiqaptam ruwarqa, huk punchaw kaypi.
Everything seems to never happen.	Tukuy imapas mana haykapipas kanman hinam.
It’s just like now.	Kunan hinallam.
But there is a purpose to it.	Ichaqa kanmi imapaqpas chay ruwayqa.
We probably did that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqayku.
Please, like this.	Ama hina kaspa, kay hinata.
That’s what you are.	Chaytaqa qanmi kanki.
I can't say anything now.	Kunanqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
He doesn’t want to be good.	Payqa manam allin kayta munanchu.
It wouldn’t be that good.	Manan chay hina allinchu kanman.
I feel proud of myself.	Orgulloso sientekuni.
They love to watch the game.	Paykunaqa anchatam munanku pukllayta qawayta.
I feel lucky.	Suerteyoqmi sientekuni.
I don’t know where.	Mana yachanichu maypi.
Just say it and do it and don't be anything to it.	Chaylla niy hinaspa ruway hinaspa ama imapas chayman kaychu.
Of course, he knew nothing.	Arí, payqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu.
But I can’t figure out how.	Ichaqa manan yuyaymanayta atinichu imaynatachus chayta.
Very bad, actually.	Ancha mana allin, chiqaptaqa.
She told him not to talk to her again.	Payqa nirqanmi manaña hukmanta paywan rimananpaq.
He is always out of place.	Payqa sapa kutim mana maypipas kasqanpi tarikun.
He wants to do that.	Payqa chayta ruwayta munan.
This was really stupid.	Kayqa chiqap sonso karqa.
And the other thing is, people agree.	Hinaspa huknin kaqmi, runakunaqa acuerdopi kanku.
But it wasn’t a big deal.	Ichaqa manan hatun ruwaychu karqan.
I still have not been able to solve this problem.	Kunankamapas manam kay sasachakuy allichayta atirqanichu.
I shouldn’t be happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanay.
I don’t see it, but it’s good.	Manam rikunichu, ichaqa allinmi.
Whatever the truth.	Ima chiqap kaptinpas.
He was devastated and depressed.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa, llakisqa ima kasharqan.
I have half a mind to tell you.	Kuskan yuyayniyuqmi kani willanaypaq.
She’s so beautiful to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqapaq.
If all this sounds confusing, that’s fine.	Sichus tukuy kay pantasqa hina uyarikun chayqa, allinmi.
A few hours.	Iskay kimsa hora.
I was very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi karqani.
He was never a man.	Manam haykapipas runachu karqa.
But, then again, maybe not.	Ichaqa, chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas mana.
People are eager to learn more.	Runakunaqa anchatam munanku astawan yachayta.
It went faster, and faster.	Aswan utqayllam rirqa, hinaspa aswan utqaylla.
So far, this has been some practice.	Kunankamaqa, kayqa wakin ruwaymi karqan.
I did that a while ago.	Chaytaqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqani.
No idea whatsoever there.	Mana ima yuyayniyuq chaypi.
Yes, you do, too.	Arí qampas.
He just didn’t do anything.	Chaylla mana imatapas ruwarqanchu.
People are not worth it.	Runakunaqa manan valenchu.
Yes, it would be.	Arí, chayna kanman.
I worry every day.	Sapa punchawmi llakikuni.
I'm not quite sure what that is about.	Manam allintachu yachani imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
He didn’t want to drive alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu carropi puriyta munarqan.
I really want to see it.	Anchatam munani qawayta.
But I don't think this will work.	Ichaqa manan piensanichu kayqa allinta ruwananta.
That was surprisingly inappropriate.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi mana allinchu karqa.
I truly mean it.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta niyta munani.
Someone was wrong.	Pipas pantasqa kasqa.
I didn’t think this would happen.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasananta.
But he knew, he knew.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi, yacharqanmi.
So for now, at least, you can be sure of me.	Chaymi kunankamaqa, aswanpas, ñuqamanta seguro kanki.
A year later, he failed again.	Huk wata qhepamanmi hukmanta mana allintachu ruwarqan.
There were two things there.	Chaypin iskay imakuna kasqa.
I thought it was pretty funny.	Ñuqaqa ancha asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Like every other year.	Sapa iskay wata hina.
There has to be time.	Tiempo kanan tiyan.
If someone doesn’t like me, that’s fine.	Sichus pipas mana gustawanchu chayqa, allinmi.
So then this was it.	Chaymi chaymanta kayqa karqan.
I look forward to seeing it again.	Suyachkani hukmanta qawayta.
Obviously that didn’t matter.	Sut’inmi karqan chayqa manan imananpaschu.
Today was the worst.	Kunan punchawqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
He was a stupid guy.	Payqa sonso runam karqa.
No one is sane, anyway.	Mana pipas allin yuyayniyuqchu, imayna kaptinpas.
This one is more difficult.	Kayqa aswan sasa.
A good one, yes.	Huk allin, arí.
Everything seemed terribly serious.	Tukuy imapas manchay serio hinam rikchakurqa.
Actually he was right.	Chiqaptaqa payqa allintam nirqa.
But he doesn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu munan.
He’s fast, very fast.	Payqa utqaylla, ancha utqaylla.
I like to be busy all the time.	Tukuy tiempo ocupasqa kaymi gustan.
He lives there.	Payqa chaypim tiyan.
I don’t know if you can tell.	Mana yachanichu willayta atisqaykita.
Good evening to you.	Allin chisi qampaq.
That gave him a bit of time.	Chayqa huk chikan tiempotan qorqan.
Probably more than me.	Yaqapaschá ñuqamanta aswan achka.
Maybe he isn’t right.	Ichapas payqa mana allinchu kachkan.
So here it is ?.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan ?.
And for no reason whatsoever.	Hinaspa mana imaraykupas imaraykupas.
It’s a good cold night.	Allin chiri tutan.
He had been mad at her before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi paywan phiñasqa kasqa.
I am really afraid to take anything here.	Chiqaptam manchakuni kaypi imatapas hapiyta.
I don’t, I can’t, do it.	Manam, mana atiymanchu, ruwayta.
Maybe it’s something in the past.	Ichapas ñawpaqpi imapas kanman.
No one could see into it.	Manam pipas chaymanqa rikuyta atirqachu.
I'm in a hurry.	Ñuqaqa utqayllam kachkani.
It had to be something big.	Imapas hatunmi kanan karqa.
It means to do or do.	Ruway utaq ruway niyta munan.
He didn't want to wait to find out more.	Payqa manan suyayta munarqanchu astawan yachananpaq.
I thought that was great.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He bought it.	Paymi rantirqa.
People who are too intelligent.	Llumpay yuyayniyuq runakuna.
But we did it right.	Ichaqa allintan chayta ruwarqayku.
He knows how the world is about him.	Payqa yachanmi kay pacha imayna paymanta kasqanmanta.
I was just outside a while ago.	Chayllaraqmi hawapi karqani huk rato ñawpaqta.
He never talked much about anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imamantapas anchatachu rimarqan.
He wasn’t always like that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
So maybe that’s the best thing to do.	Chaymi ichapas chay ruwayqa aswan allin kanman.
I feel very comfortable too.	Ñuqapas ancha allinmi tarikuni.
Perhaps he wanted to do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwayta munarqan.
You are a beauty.	Sumaq kaymi kanki.
A difference of this, a difference of that.	Huk chikan kaymanta, huk chikan chaymanta.
But you don’t know how wrong you are.	Ichaqa manan yachankichu imayna pantasqa kasqaykita.
I just don’t see how.	Chaylla mana rikunichu imaynatachus chayta.
And make real money.	Hinaspa chiqap qullqita ruway.
So you can do all of that.	Chaymi tukuy chaykunataqa ruwawaq.
I don't see how he could do that.	Manam rikunichu imaynatam chayta ruwayta atinman karqa.
There is a lot of foolishness.	Achka mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kachkan.
But they were all good.	Ichaqa llapallankum allin karqaku.
I don’t know how he feels about her.	Manam yachanichu paymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I want to see it very soon.	Ancha utqaylla qawayta munani.
He has a great overall sense of humor.	Payqa hatun tukuy yuyayniyuqmi.
He did it right.	Chaytaqa allintan ruwarqan.
But this is absurd.	Ichaqa kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
He is here this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi kaypi kachkan.
I just know that you are.	Chaylla yachani chayna kasqaykita.
Maybe he couldn’t say anything.	Ichapas mana imatapas niyta atirqachu.
And now, go ahead.	Hinaspa kunan, riy.
It’s like you’re not here.	Mana kaypichu kanki hinam.
Really, really low.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta pisi.
I think this is a good thing.	Kayqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
Everyone knows that.	Llapallankum chayta yachanku.
Probably there were no other people.	Yaqapaschá huk runakunaqa karqanchu.
It was no longer useful.	Manañan imapaqpas hinachu karqan.
And then there it was.	Hinaspa chaymanta chaypi karqan.
That meant the next morning.	Chayqa paqarin paqarinmi niyta munarqa.
I never knew how to do it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imayna ruwaytaqa.
At the time, he did just that.	Chay tiempopiqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
It’s that amazing.	Chayna admirakuypaqmi.
It was like a night.	Huk tuta hinam karqa.
I just saw it like a month ago.	Chayraqmi huk killa ñawpaqta hina rikurqani.
There is one above.	Hukninmi kan hawapi.
There is nothing like that.	Manan imapas chay hinachu.
You were really, really nice.	Chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi karqanki.
These are foolish people.	Kaykunaqa mana yuyayniyuq runakunam.
He certainly thought about what he was doing.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa yuyaykurqan chay ruwasqanpi.
Then again, that didn’t mean much in the end.	Chaymanta yapamanta, chayqa manan anchatachu niyta munarqan tukukuypi.
You do the job.	Qanmi chayta ruwayta ruwanki.
It probably wasn’t true.	Manapaschá cheqaqchu karqan.
She is very young.	Payqa ancha sipasmi.
Another great first.	Huk hatun ñawpaq.
Therefore, they were expelled.	Chayraykum qarqusqa karqaku.
I thought that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinpaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He did it all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwarqa.
Like that night.	Chay tutamanta hina.
He wanted her to do it again.	Payqa munarqanmi hukmanta chayta ruwananta.
It enhances your personality.	Chayqa aswan allintan ruwan imayna runa kasqaykita.
About ten days ago.	Yaqa chunka punchaw ñawpaqta.
I mean, he really wanted her.	Niyta munani, payqa anchatam payta munarqa.
He thinks about it, but not for long.	Chaypin yuyaykun, ichaqa manan unaytachu.
Everything just happened.	Tukuy imapas chayllam pasarqa.
You'll do well, well.	Allintam ruwanki, allinta.
He can’t be here for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu kaypi kanman.
The process needs to be repeated.	Chay ruwayqa kuti kutita ruwana tiyan.
I was always too cold, too cold.	Sapa kutim llumpay chiri, llumpay chiri karqani.
I seem to have been really surprised.	Chiqaptam admirakurqani hina.
This seems to be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi rikchakun.
Always and often.	Sapa kuti hinaspa sapa kuti.
It wasn't the only first.	Manam chayllachu ñawpaq kaq karqa.
This statement makes no sense.	Kay nisqanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
One makes another.	Hukninmi hukta ruwan.
Folks, this is huge.	Runakuna, kayqa hatunmi.
The second one.	Chay iskay kaq.
I wonder what’s wrong.	Imataq mana allin kasqanmanta tapukuni.
But here it may not be so difficult.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manapaschá chayna sasachu kanman.
All day, evening.	Tukuy punchaw, chisi.
I don’t have to agree.	Manam acuerdopichu kanay.
I never thought it would be that hard.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna sasa kananta.
But how lonely.	Ichaqa imayna sapallan.
Probably, he never could.	Yaqapaschá, mana hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
I'm still not sure it's right.	Hinallam mana segurochu kani allin kasqanmanta.
Very nice people.	Ancha sumaq runakuna.
You know what you have to do.	Yachanki ima ruwanaykita.
So there had to be something else there.	Chaymi chaypi huk imapas kanan karqa.
Don’t do regular things.	Mana sapa kuti ruwaykunata ruwaychu.
That's all, really.	Chayllam, chiqaptapuni.
I probably wouldn’t do that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
Very great indeed.	Ancha hatun chiqap.
He knew how to live, but he didn’t want to stay.	Payqa tiyayta yacharqanmi, ichaqa manan chaypi qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
The first approach is almost always likely to fail.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwayqa yaqa llapanpim mana allinta ruwananpaq hina kachkan.
She realized what he was thinking.	Payqa repararqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
But no one ever did.	Ichaqa manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
That’s me again.	Chayqa ñuqa yapamanta.
I’m human, at least.	Runa kani, aswanpas.
I mean, it's not good.	Mana allintam niyta munani.
One of them is a cigarette smoker.	Hukninmi cigarrota pitaq.
In fact, it probably was.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
I’m a housewife.	Wasi runa kani.
More often than not, anyway.	Aswan sapa kuti, imayna kaptinpas.
I have to disagree with that.	Chaypiqa manam acuerdopichu kanay.
The truth always does.	Cheqaq kaqmi sapa kutilla chayta ruwan.
I wonder what he thinks.	Tapukunitaqmi ima piensasqanmanta.
Yes, something was wrong.	Arí, imapas mana allinchu karqa.
This was the simple truth.	Kaymi karqan chay facil cheqaq kaq.
This he can never do here.	Kaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypiqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
They were always there.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim chaypi karqaku.
Can’t stand him.	Mana aguantayta atinchu payta.
It’s funny, it’s childish.	Asikunapaq hinam, wawa hinam.
I had to do everything on my own.	Tukuy imatam sapallay ruwanay karqa.
He had to do all the work.	Tukuy ruwaykunata ruwanan karqan.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinmi karqa.
They are always very fast.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim ancha utqaylla kanku.
Of course, this was easier.	Chiqamanta, kayqa aswan facil karqa.
This was madness.	Kayqa loco kaymi karqa.
They are beautiful, everything is beautiful.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi, tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Before, he was no longer alone.	Ñawpaqtaqa manañam sapallanchu karqa.
All right, right.	Tukuy allin.
That’s how he knows.	Chaynatam yachan.
We have to do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwananchik.
But it certainly was.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chay hinaqa karqan.
I couldn’t hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyariyta atirqanichu.
I can’t be with you.	Manan qanwan kayta atiymanchu.
He really was something.	Payqa chiqaptam imapas karqa.
I couldn’t afford one now.	Kunanqa manan hukta rantiyta atirqanichu.
But I was always too much of me.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi nishuta ñoqamanta karqani.
So that’s something.	Chaymi chayqa imapas.
Nothing, nothing .	Mana imapas, mana imapas .
Everything is good about it.	Tukuy imapas allinmi chaymanta.
Don't forget to tell us.	Ama qunqaychu willayta.
We have a little secret here.	Kaypiqa huk chikan pakasqa kachkaniku.
Again, this is unfortunate.	Yapamanta kayqa llakikuypaqmi.
They're not ready yet.	Manaraqmi listochu kachkanku.
I am a busy person.	Ocupasqa runam kani.
He didn’t know, he wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu, manan segurochu karqan.
Now it’s just you.	Kunanqa qamllam kachkan.
Maybe it will be better in the morning.	Ichapas tutamanta aswan allin kanqa.
It should have the same name as before.	Ñawpaq hina sutin kanan.
Very, very happy about it.	Ancha, ancha kusisqa chaymanta.
As a last resort.	Qhipa kaq ruway hina.
Just about anything with you a lot.	Yaqa imapas qamwan achka.
The success is uncertain.	Chay allin ruwayqa mana segurochu.
He wasn’t quite right.	Payqa manan allintachu karqan.
No one seemed to be like that.	Manam pipas chayna hinachu karqa.
He did it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwarqa.
A little while.	Huk pisi pacha.
I haven’t heard back from him yet.	Manaraqmi paymanta kutichiyta uyarirqanichu.
You're never sure.	Manam haykapipas segurochu kanki.
But that's what you had to do.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwanayki karqa.
Too much not to laugh at.	Ancha achka mana asikunapaq.
Very happy indeed.	Ancha kusisqa chiqap.
Looked at in the city.	Chay llaqtapi qhawarisqa.
So he was terrified.	Chaymi mancharisqa kasqa.
But it was like nothing.	Ichaqa mana imapas hinam karqa.
They looked sad.	Paykunaqa llakisqa qhawarisqa karqanku.
I learn a lot almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi achkata yachani.
It can be every week.	Sapa semanan kanman.
We did it last year.	Qayna wata ruwarqayku.
it will do it.	chaymi ruwanqa.
I want more and more.	Aswan achkatam munani.
I can’t get over that.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu.
A little after midnight.	Kuska tutamanta huk chhikanta.
Very happy, actually.	Ancha kusisqa, chiqaptaqa.
Here they were.	Kaypim karqaku.
Again we disagree.	Hukmanta mana acuerdopichu kayku.
That’s probably not the case.	Chayqa manapaschá.
You’re bigger than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi kanki.
Nothing he could remember, that is.	Mana imapas yuyariyta atisqanmanta, chaymi.
So it was there.	Chaymi chaypi kasqa.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Mana yachanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
It was too homely.	Chayqa llumpay wasipi kaqmi karqa.
Surprisingly, they almost seemed happy about it.	Admirakuypaqmi yaqa kusisqa hina karqaku chaymanta.
Anyway, it was fine.	Imayna kaptinpas, allinmi karqa.
Maybe it’s a little different.	Ichapas huk chikan kanman.
They are, after all, adults.	Paykunaqa, tukuy imamanta, kuraq runakuna kanku.
I was happy!.	¡Kusisqam karqani!.
By doing the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwaspa.
About half the time.	Yaqa kuskan pacha.
But it’s really easy.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin facil.
It wasn’t very good to be drunk at home.	Mana ancha allinchu karqan wasipi machasqa kay.
Everyone is here.	Lliwmi kaypi kachkan.
Sorry for the late hour.	Pampachaykuway chay hora tarde kasqanmanta.
It was a bad day.	Millay punchawmi karqa.
And if anyone has trouble with it.	Hinaspa sichus pipas chaywan sasachakuypi tarikun chayqa.
He’s been here a long time.	Payqa unayñan kaypi kashan.
For the most part, he was successful.	Yaqa llapanpim payqa allinta ruwarqa.
Thus, of course, it is not.	Chay hinaqa, sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu.
I want him to be proud.	Munani orgulloso kananta.
The man is no more.	Chay runaqa manañam kanchu.
The last day.	Qhepa p’unchay.
Nothing ever does.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
That you are.	Chay qam kasqaykita.
That’s why they’re here.	Chayraykum kaypi kachkanku.
He would never have wanted to.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas munanmanchu karqan.
I like anything and everything.	Imapas tukuy imapas gustanmi.
You are very very beautiful.	Ancha ancha sumaqmi kanki.
That’s all I have.	Chayllam ñuqapa kaq.
Everything was very easy to do.	Tukuy imapas ruwayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
He really wanted her to be successful.	Payqa anchatan munarqan allin kananpaq.
Everything was very sad.	Tukuy imapas ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
That’s a guy.	Chayqa huk wayna.
It would be cold all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chiri kanman.
He really knows stuff!.	¡Payqa chiqaptam yachan imakunatapas!.
I don’t mean much.	Manam anchatachu niyta munani.
A couple of months at most.	Huk iskay killa aswan achka.
But they are not unhappy.	Ichaqa manan mana kusisqachu kanku.
That’s what I like.	Chayqa gustanmi.
That’s why this is all so great.	Chayraykum kayqa tukuy ancha hatun.
I wanted to live here.	Kaypi tiyayta munarqani.
It actually happened to me once.	Chiqaptaqa huk kutim ñuqawan pasarqa.
He knew tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam yacharqa.
The best thing to do is to do nothing.	Aswan allinqa, mana imatapas ruwaymi.
It’s available all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kachkan.
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Paymi niwarqa ñuqawan rimayta munasqanmanta.
He almost never did.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
She was nicer without it.	Payqa aswan sumaqmi karqan mana chaywanqa.
I didn’t want the fame or the recognition.	Manam munarqanichu chay riqsisqa kayta nitaq chay riqsisqa kayta.
I can’t talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta atiymanchu.
You have a terrible appearance.	Qanmi kanki manchay rikchayniyuq.
He sounds crazy.	Payqa loco hinam uyarikun.
What a lot of people.	Ima achka runakuna.
Very nice cold.	Ancha sumaq chiri.
He told me that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi niwarqa.
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwayta munarqani.
I’m sick of myself.	Ñuqamanta unqusqa kachkani.
I know that to be true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani.
But of course, that’s not always the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, manan sapa kutichu chay hinaqa.
But, that's just enough.	Ichaqa, chayllaraqmi chaylla.
Happy or sad.	Kusisqa utaq llakisqa.
Not sure what it looks like yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu imayna kasqanmanta.
And at the time it was.	Hinaspa chay tiempopiqa chayna karqa.
He says there is nothing.	Payqa ninmi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
It’s all very serious.	Tukuy imapas ancha serio.
If anything he was the nicest.	Sichus imapas payqa aswan sumaqmi karqan.
I think that's ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam nispaymi piensani.
And a strong player.	Hinaspa huk sinchi pukllaq.
This is an interesting idea.	Kayqa sumaq yuyayniyuqmi.
He must act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan.
Really fast.	Chiqap utqaylla.
I don’t want to stop being that person.	Manam chay runa kayta saqiyta munanichu.
But you do it now.	Ichaqa kunanmi ruwanki.
And he was great.	Hinaspa payqa hatunmi kasqa.
At the end of the meal.	Mikhuy tukukuypi.
That just happened.	Chayqa chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
After that, the world.	Chay qhepamanmi kay pacha.
He had no idea how he was going to do it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna ruwananta.
It depends on a lot of things.	Chayqa achka ima kasqanmantam.
This has always worked for me.	Kayqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq allin karqa.
You were very serious before.	Ñawpaqtaqa ancha serio karqanki.
It just doesn’t get any easier than that.	Chaylla mana chaymanta aswan facilchu kanman.
You know it’s wrong, anyway.	Yachanki mana allin kasqanmanta, imayna kaptinpas.
If he is, it is him.	Pay kaptinqa, paymi.
I could never stand it.	Manam haykapipas aguantayta atirqanichu.
Not sure how it is.	Mana segurochu imaynatachus chayta.
He seemed fine with it.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa chaywanqa.
The second worst.	Iskay kaq aswan mana allin.
It’s actually worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymanta aswan mana allinmi.
Everything was black.	Tukuy imapas yana kasqa.
This is a really good thing to do.	Kayqa chiqap allin ruwaymi.
In fact, he barely looked at her.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá paytaqa qhawarisqa.
I’m really hungry.	Cheqaqtapunin yarqasqa kashani.
I am happier than ever.	Aswan kusisqam kachkani.
I can hear it.	Uyariyta atiyman.
I mean, it might not be what it used to be.	Niyta munani, manapaschá ñawpaqpi hinachu kanman.
It was amazing there.	Chaypiqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
This is obviously ridiculous.	Kayqa sut’inmi asikunapaq hina.
He agreed with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kasqa.
It would be amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanman.
I still know where he is.	Kunankamapas yachanim maypi kasqanmanta.
This would be easier, he said.	Kayqa aswan facilmi kanman, nispan nirqa.
Very bad for you.	Ancha mana allin qampaq.
I did that every week.	Chaytaqa sapa semanan ruwaq kani.
Everyone wants to actually be with you.	Lliwmi munanku chiqaptaqa qamwan kayta.
Worse, he looked sick.	Aswan mana allinqa, unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
This is not going to be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanqa.
That’s not everyone.	Chayqa manam llapa runachu.
But we disagree with that statement.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu kayku chay nisqanman hinaqa.
I'm not sure why that would be.	Manam segurochu kani imarayku chayna kanman.
Hidden three.	Pakasqa kimsa.
Second, third, .	Iskay kaq, kimsa kaq, .
It looks really funny.	Chiqaptam asikunapaq hina rikchakun.
He wanted to know what he was going to do.	Ima ruwananta yachayta munarqa.
He’s obviously very disappointed.	Payqa sut’inmi ancha hukmanyasqa kashan.
I can’t be happy.	Manam kusisqa kayta atiymanchu.
Here, he was wrong.	Kaypiqa, pantasqa kasqa.
We are very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kanchik.
Once, once and for all.	Huk kuti, huk kutilla.
No one ever thought of doing that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwananpaqqa hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu.
This one did the most.	Kaymi aswan achkata ruwarqa.
Today, however, it is not.	Kunan punchawmi ichaqa mana.
Yeah, that’s pretty cool.	Arí, chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I have to get the action right.	Ruwayta allinta ruwanay tiyan.
Two this week.	Iskay kay semanapi.
A very young man.	Huk ancha wayna.
It was very difficult to talk to him.	Paywan rimayqa ancha sasam karqa.
That was a bad thing to do.	Chayqa karqan mana allin ruwaymi.
It speaks volumes.	Anchatam riman.
That it never existed.	Mana hayk’aqpas kasqanmanta.
But obviously, that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kashan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
If he is hidden, he is not alone.	Pakasqa kaptinqa manam sapallanchu.
No one could work there.	Chaypiqa manan pipas llank’ayta atirqanchu.
Now the good thing.	Kunanqa allin kaq.
He thought a lot.	Payqa anchatan yuyaykurqan.
He looked lonely.	Payqa sapallanmi rikchakurqa.
I never knew his real name.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chiqap sutinta.
The man was found.	Chay runaqa tarikurqa.
Maybe that’s what it means.	Ichapas chayta niyta munan.
And what else.	Hinaspa imatataq.
Anyway, that's me for now.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymi ñuqaqa kunankamaqa.
Actually, it’s pretty cool.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha sumaqmi.
I know you are really busy.	Yachanim chiqaptapuni ocupasqa kasqaykita.
it turned out well.	allintam lluqsirqa.
However, it is better than nothing.	Ichaqa, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
He knew he was right.	Payqa yacharqanmi allin kasqanmanta.
You want something from me.	Ñoqamanta imatapas munanki.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kani chaywan.
They readily agreed.	Paykunaqa chayllam acuerdopi karqaku.
He was supposed to be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanan karqan.
He must continue to exist.	Payqa hinallam kanan.
Today was not that day.	Kunan punchawqa manam chay punchawchu karqa.
But then, it fails.	Ichaqa chaymanta, mana allintachu ruwan.
And me, despite everything.	Hinaspa ñuqapas, tukuy ima kaptinpas.
He wouldn’t have been a human being.	Manan runachu kanman karqan.
This is bigger than him.	Kayqa paymanta aswan hatunmi.
How can this be?.	¿Imaynataq kay kanman?.
They weren’t like me, after all.	Paykunaqa manan ñoqa hinachu karqanku, tukuy imamanta.
They are neither here nor there.	Paykunaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kashanku.
But now it wasn’t right.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan allinchu karqan.
We are always busy with that.	Chaywanqa sapa kutim ocupasqa kachkaniku.
He knows the way well.	Payqa allintam yachan chay ñanta.
He spent two weeks in the hospital.	Iskay semanan hospitalpi qhepakurqan.
He's really excited.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha kusisqa kachkan.
Today, however, this is no longer true.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manañan chayqa cheqaqchu.
Please learn about this.	Ama hina kaspa kaymanta yachay.
He was obviously excited.	Payqa sut’inmi kusisqa kasharqan.
He refused to talk for a week.	Payqa huk semanan mana rimayta munarqanchu.
I have been here for a year now.	Kunanqa huk watañam kaypi kachkani.
I can’t do well in that.	Manam chaypiqa allintachu ruwayman.
Both are intelligent.	Iskayninkum allin yuyayniyuq kanku.
But it can’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
Yeah, it’s okay, it’s okay.	Arí, allinmi, allinmi.
It may not mean anything.	Manapaschá imatapas niyta munanchu.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Mana kunan punchawchu chayqa, paqarinmi.
But he didn't seem angry.	Ichaqa manan phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
It was the most important next step for him.	Chayqa karqan aswan importante qatiqnin ruwaymi paypaq.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kasqa.
He did great things with it.	Chaywanmi hatun ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
I can't seem to get this working.	Kay llamk'ayta mana tariyta atiymanchu hina.
He didn’t need them.	Payqa manan chaykunataqa necesitarqanchu.
It was nothing like the first one.	Chayqa manan imapas ñawpaq kaq hinachu karqan.
You were great tonight.	Kunan tutaqa ancha allinmi karqanki.
Not quite sure what to do though.	Mana allintachu yachani imata ruwanaypaq ichaqa.
He couldn’t figure out anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yachayta atirqanchu.
He was always with her in the hospital.	Payqa sapa kutim paywan kuska hospitalpi karqa.
That’s like you and me.	Chayqa qampas ñuqapas hinam.
Here he did very well.	Kaypi payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
Just can’t find what’s wrong.	Chaylla mana tariyta atinchu ima mana allin kaqta.
He was truly the greatest speaker of his day.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chay tiempopi aswan hatun rimaq karqan.
I couldn't find it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam tariyta atirqanichu.
I thought it would be good.	Allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
That, he realized, would be a bigger problem.	Chayqa, repararqanmi aswan hatun sasachakuy kananta.
And then who knew what to do with it.	Hinaspa chaymanta pi yacharqa ima ruwananta chaywan.
There is no moon.	Manam killa kanchu.
Be happy together.	Kuska kusisqa kay.
He didn’t think about that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
I’m busy here.	Kaypiqa ocupasqa kachkani.
The important thing in everything.	Tukuy imapipas chay importante kaq.
He can't get out.	Payqa manam lluqsiyta atinchu.
At least it seems to be, every week.	Aswanpas kanman hinam, sapa semana.
With no one at all, really.	Mana piwanpas ni imapipas, chiqaptaqa.
But last night.	Ichaqa qayna tutan.
It is indeed current.	Cheqaqtapunin kunan tiempopi kashan.
But he was drunk.	Ichaqa machasqa kasqa.
Beautiful looking, as always.	Sumaq qhawarisqa, sapa kuti hina.
I think he’s tired.	Sayk’usqa kashasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
Anyway, there you are.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaypim kachkanki.
It’s really, really bad.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana allinchu.
The important stuff is the best.	Importante kaqmi aswan allinqa.
I just didn’t want to believe it.	Chayllam mana creeyta munarqanichu.
I wish he was.	Munaymanmi payqa.
He might not be there.	Manapaschá chaypichu kanman.
That’s a very, very big deal.	Chayqa ancha ancha hatunmi.
He was an older man.	Payqa kuraq runan karqan.
That would be really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanman.
Eat better than that.	Chaymanta aswan allinta mikhuy.
He knew exactly what he was going to do.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima ruwananta.
Once it's here, things will be interesting.	Huk kuti kaypi kaptinqa, imapas sumaqmi kanqa.
But he didn’t tell you that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nisurqanki.
He doesn’t know how good he is.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
I know enough to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani.
Well, that’s what he did.	Chayqa, chaytam ruwarqa.
A child is here.	Huk wawa kaypi kachkan.
It just had nowhere to go.	Chayllaraqmi mana maymanpas rinanpaq kasqa.
Not yet there.	Manaraq chaypichu.
I learned more and more about myself.	Astawan astawan ñuqamanta yacharqani.
He was not alone in prison.	Manam sapallanchu carcelpi karqa.
I don’t want him to be unhappy.	Manam munanichu mana kusisqa kananta.
He never could .	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas atirqanchu.
Where he wants to.	Maypichus munasqanman hina.
He is like the first child.	Payqa ñawpaq kaq wawa hinam.
Why it’s so important.	Imaraykutaq ancha allin.
This is the whole thing.	Kaymi tukuy ima.
But that meant he had to go right here.	Ichaqa chaymi niyta munarqa kayman allinta rinan kasqanmanta.
And, it continues.	Hinaspa, hinallam kachkan.
He knew it wasn’t true.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana cheqaq kasqanmanta.
I don’t want to be sad.	Manam munanichu llakisqa kayta.
I can tell you the real, hard truth.	Chiqap, sinchi chiqaptam niyta atiyman.
He can't stop it.	Mana hark'ayta atinchu.
Where he could be himself.	Maypichus pay kikin kayta atinman karqan.
It's like it never existed.	Mana hayk'aqpas karqan hinan.
But that’s not exactly true.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allintachu cheqaq.
I mean, this is huge.	Niyta munani, kayqa hatunmi.
Something bad, something beautiful.	Imapas mana allin, imapas sumaq.
I feel ready.	Listo hinam tarikuni.
That statement makes good sense.	Chay rimayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
I wanted to be something too.	Ñuqapas imapas kaytam munarqani.
So he seemed real serious about it.	Chaymi payqa chiqap serio hina karqa chaymanta.
They were all about me.	Lliwmi ñuqamanta karqaku.
He didn't know what he was afraid of.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima manchakusqanmanta.
That didn’t feel right.	Chayqa mana allintachu tarikurqa.
You knew that, you knew it early on.	Chaytaqa yacharqanki, ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqanki.
He was always there for me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq karqa.
The bad guy.	Mana allin runa.
He was exhausted afterwards.	Chay qhepamanmi sayk’usqa kasharqan.
I’m not waiting that long.	Manam chay unaytachu suyachkani.
You know he can't.	Yachankim mana atisqanmanta.
If they were happy before, they were happy now.	Sichus ñawpaqta kusisqa karqanku chayqa, kunanmi kusisqa karqanku.
Everything is just how it is.	Tukuy imapas chaylla imayna kasqanmanta.
Worst of all, it was never the same.	Aswan mana allinqa, manan hayk’aqpas huk hinachu karqan.
I know he has a name.	Yachanim sutiyuq kasqanmanta.
I had never heard of such things.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa uyarirqanichu.
And, we are prompt and on time.	Hinaspa, usqhaylla hinaspa tiempollanpi kayku.
A little angry.	Huk chikan phiñasqa.
It certainly wouldn’t be me.	Chiqamanta mana ñuqachu kanman.
I think everyone is guilty of this.	Kaypiqa llapallanku huchayoq kasqankuta yuyaykuni.
This went well for a while.	Kayqa huk pacha allintam rirqa.
I can't think about it now.	Kunanqa manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
Man, you know that.	Runa, chayta yachanki.
Perhaps this is acceptable.	Ichapas kayqa allinpaq hapisqa kanman.
When you do that, do it right.	Chayta ruwaspaqa allinta ruway.
A few hours, actually.	Iskay kimsa hora, chiqaptaqa.
That, however, does not seem to be the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
Someone more famous than me.	Pipas ñuqamanta aswan riqsisqa.
Okay, okay, very good.	Allinmi, allinmi, ancha allinmi.
That was yesterday, this is today.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa, kayqa kunan punchawmi.
He’s not there, you know.	Payqa manan chaypichu kashan, yachanki.
They know how to play.	Paykunaqa pukllayta yachanku.
I don’t want to see you tonight.	Manam kunan tuta rikuyta munanichu.
All innocent acting, everything.	Tukuy mana huchayoq ruway, tukuy ima.
He is the one I like best.	Paymi aswan allinta gustan.
Many people disagreed.	Achka runakunam mana acuerdopichu karqaku.
A lot of people there.	Achka runakuna chaypi.
He can't stand it.	Chaytaqa manam aguantayta atinchu.
However, this process is not always so simple.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina facilchu.
Always wrong.	Sapa kuti pantasqa.
Everything was very easy.	Tukuy imapas ancha facilmi karqa.
There is no reason why it should be.	Manam kanchu imaraykupas chayna kananta.
But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa manan munarqanchu.
One day, he succeeded.	Huk punchawmi, payqa allinta ruwarqa.
You have no idea how that worked out for me.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanki imaynatam ñuqapaq chayna kasqanmanta.
They are not happy.	Paykunaqa manam kusisqachu kanku.
Is this a feature? 	¿Kayqa huk ruwaychu?
He’s that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi.
He would be really crazy.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin loco kanman.
He thought he would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananta.
He probably didn't care.	Payqa manapaschá imananpaschu karqan.
And that’s what .	Hinaspa chaymi .
Don’t do something you can’t do.	Ama mana ruwanaykipaq hina ruwaychu.
I don’t remember anyone living there.	Manam yuyarinichu chaypi tiyaq pitapas.
Okay, it sounds good.	Allinmi, allinmi uyarikun.
Maybe we need to do something else.	Ichapas huk ruwaytapas ruwananchik kanqa.
I saw him tonight.	Kunan tutam payta rikurqani.
I just listened to it.	Chaylla uyarirqani.
Maybe they know the real story.	Ichapas paykunaqa chiqap willakuyta yachanku.
It’s not always the case.	Manan sapa kutichu kan.
So, three people.	Chaymi, kimsa runakuna.
Say thanks but no thanks.	Gracias nispa ichaqa mana gracias nispa niy.
I couldn’t do that now.	Manam kunanqa chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
I can’t understand why.	Mana entiendeyta atinichu imarayku.
Now he had to act quickly.	Kunanqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
That will be of some importance later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi wakin importante kanqa.
I wouldn’t be happy there.	Chaypiqa manam kusisqachu kayman.
I’m very good at it.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi kani chaypi.
We’ve all done him a terrible disservice.	Llapanchismi paytaqa sinchita mana allinta ruwarqayku.
Surely he would have.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa chayta ruwanman karqan.
He always did it.	Payqa sapa kutim ruwarqa.
Two years, more.	Iskay wata, astawan.
I was always ready.	Sapa kutim listo karqani.
Obviously I don’t want to do this.	Sut’inmi mana kayta ruwayta munanichu.
There is nothing I can do now.	Kunanqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu.
That was one of them.	Chayqa huknin kaqmi karqa.
But it won’t be that easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hinaqa facilchu kanqa.
It was the second time that morning.	Chay paqarinmi iskay kaq kuti karqa.
That’s what people want to hear.	Chaytan runakunaqa uyariyta munanku.
You think you are great things.	Hatun imakuna kasqaykita yuyanki.
She looked hard at him.	Payqa sinchitan payta qhawarirqan.
You can’t predict that.	Chaytaqa manan willayta atiwaqchu.
He was happy and happy.	Payqa kusisqa kusisqa kasharqan.
Boy, that’s what you want.	Wayna, chaymi munanki.
Or next month.	Utaq hamuq killapi.
I would like to have a chat with you please.	Munayman huk rimayta qanwan ama hina kaspa.
It would be a beautiful thing.	Sumaq kaqmi kanman.
That was one of mine.	Chayqa huknin ñuqapa kaqmi karqa.
Easy but wrong.	Facil ichaqa pantasqa.
I know what he can do.	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta.
And why now.	Hinaspa imarayku kunan.
He has to do the right thing.	Payqa allintam ruwanan.
I hope he comes back one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw kutimunanta.
I mean, he has no choice.	Niyta munani, payqa manam ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
It’s good enough for you.	Allinmi qampaq hina.
It's cold out there this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi chay hawapi chiri kachkan.
Something had to be done, and quickly.	Imapas ruwana karqa, hinaspa utqaylla.
It would be a good idea to do so.	Allinmi kanman chayta ruwayqa.
It will be very difficult for me.	Ancha sasam kanqa ñuqapaq.
Seriously this time.	Serio kay kutipi.
So you can do it anywhere.	Chaymi maypipas ruwawaq.
She knew what he was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus yuyaykusqanmanta.
He was the one who was rejected.	Paymi mana allinpaq qhawarisqa karqan.
I’m not unreasonable.	Manam mana yuyayniyuqchu kani.
But it doesn’t make it as effective as coffee.	Ichaqa manan kukata hinachu aswan allinta ruwan.
But he is happier alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi aswan kusisqa.
Doesn't sound very good.	Mana ancha allintachu uyarikun.
Why is that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanman?.
We must do it now.	Kunanmi ruwananchik.
Man, he was beautiful.	Runa, payqa sumaqmi karqa.
He spent about two years there.	Chaypim yaqa iskay wata pasarqa.
So, please don’t do that.	Chaymi, ama hina kaspa ama chayta ruwaychu.
This way and that way.	Kay hinata chay hinata.
Describe it in a positive way.	Chayta allinta willay.
I want to know.	Yachayta munani.
It looks very anonymous.	Ancha mana sutiyuq rikchakun.
I’m not going to disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopichu kasaq.
Not there, there.	Mana chaypichu, chaypi.
I wonder what caused it.	Imataq chayta ruwarqa nispa tapukuni.
Now he just did it.	Kunanqa chaylla ruwarqa.
He talked about it almost every day.	Payqa yaqa sapa punchawmi chaymanta rimaq.
They are very nice people.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaq runakunam kanku.
Many were subsequently deported.	Chay qhepamanmi askha runakuna qarqosqa karqanku.
We were three cyclists.	Kimsa bicicletapi puriq kayku.
I hear it all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chayta uyarini.
Yes, that’s the possibility.	Arí, chaymi kanman.
I’d be arrested.	Ñoqaqa hap’isqa kayman.
Things are much better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi imapas kachkan.
Yes almost this happened.	Arí yaqa kaymi pasarqa.
He would have to do something about it.	Chaypaqqa imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
Hungry, then really hungry.	Yarqasqa, chaymanta chiqap yarqasqa.
Maybe you know a lot.	Ichapas achkata yachanki.
That is the greatest good.	Chayqa aswan hatun allin kaqmi.
But that may not be the case.	Ichaqa chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
You want to buy it.	Chaytaqa rantiyta munanki.
One day he did it.	Huk punchawmi chayta ruwarqa.
He couldn’t know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yachayta atirqanchu.
He was usually pretty good.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim allin allin ruwaq karqa.
He seems really sad.	Chiqap llakisqa hinam kachkan.
No one seems to know what happened.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imachus pasasqanmantaqa.
Nothing wrong at all.	Mana imapas mana allinchu ni imapipas.
Otherwise, it is not good.	Mana chayna kaptinqa mana allinchu.
You knew you couldn’t.	Yacharqanki mana atisqaykita.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allintam.
This is useless at all.	Kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​ni imapipas.
But it is the lowest point.	Ichaqa aswan pisi kaqmi.
Perhaps you are doing the same.	Yaqapaschá qampas chaynata ruwachkanki.
Don't know when they're good.	Ama yachankichu haykapi allin kasqankuta.
As an individual, you want to be the best you can be.	Sapa runa hinaqa, aswan allin kaytam munanki.
We had a really fun time doing it.	Chiqamanta kusisqa tiempota ruwarqayku ruwaspa.
Last time, man.	Qhipa kuti, runa.
That was like a lot of people.	Chayqa achka runakuna hinam karqa.
If you think about this, that’s fine.	Kaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
Please, he says.	Ama hina kaspa, nispas nin.
It’s a hard reality.	Sasa chiqap kaqmi.
It was dismissed.	Chayqa qarqusqa karqa.
But you may not succeed.	Ichaqa manapaschá allintachu ruwawaq.
You are the best!.	¡Qanmi aswan allin kanki!.
This was the problem.	Kaymi karqan chay sasachakuy.
And then it came.	Hinaspa chaymanta hamurqa.
Happy doing the job.	Kusisqa llamkayta ruwaspa.
So, so, so good.	Chaymi, chayna, chayna allin.
Everything is fine there.	Chaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He can’t understand it.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atinchu.
I don’t want to hear anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas uyariyta munanichu.
No and be honest.	Mana hinaspa chiqap rimaq kay.
That’s between you and me.	Chayqa qamwan ñuqawan.
First of all, she looked great.	Ñawpaqtaqa, payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
This is actually him.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa paymi.
Yes, there are quite a few.	Arí, kanmi ancha achka.
But he couldn't ignore it now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa mana uyariyta atirqanchu.
Something wrong there.	Imapas mana allin chaypi.
He wants to stop it as much as anyone.	Payqa pi runa hinam chayta harkayta munan.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwanan kasqanmanta.
He could not find them now.	Kunanqa manan chaykunataqa tariyta atirqanchu.
But this was a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi karqa.
I think about it a lot.	Ñuqaqa anchata yuyaykuni.
And so now that’s it.	Hinaspa chaymi kunanqa chay.
For the most part, there was nothing.	Yaqa llapanpim mana imapas karqachu.
I do like him.	Pay hinam ruwani.
It was clearly too much for him.	Sut’inmi karqan paypaq nishuta.
Sure, there have been.	Seguro, kanmi karqan.
He’s really .	Payqa chiqaptam .
Each new item should be within its capabilities.	Sapa musuq imapas atisqanman hinam kanan.
He was drunk and very angry.	Payqa machasqa hinaspa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
Something not to do.	Imapas mana ruwana.
Yes, but not always.	Arí, ichaqa manan sapa kutichu.
I’m like a bad cold.	Mana allin chiri hinam kani.
He’s a black man.	Yana runam.
Now that’s it.	Kunanqa chay.
I am always ready.	Sapa kutim listo kachkani.
Almost all the time, actually.	Yaqa tukuy tiempo, chiqaptaqa.
It is always thoroughly up to date.	Sapa kutim allinta kunan tiempopi kachkan.
I don’t like it at all.	Manam ni imapipas gustanchu.
Couldn’t be more wrong.	Mana aswan pantasqa kayta atinmanchu.
He did not know what happened next.	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan yacharqanchu.
I’m not good at all.	Manam allinchu kani ni imapipas.
Beautiful looking, very nice looking.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq, ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq.
He kept asking me about her.	Payqa sapa kutim paymanta tapuwarqa.
We are there tonight.	Kunan tuta chaypi kanchik.
He is the best at it.	Paymi chaypi aswan allinqa.
These people may not be happy anymore.	Chay runakunaqa yaqapaschá manaña kusisqachu kanku.
Of course, you would.	Chiqamanta, qamqa ruwawaq.
He will do it immediately.	Payqa chayllam ruwanqa.
They are always there for you.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim qampaq kachkan.
I didn’t listen to him.	Paytaqa mana uyarirqanichu.
Where there are people.	Maypichus runakuna kan.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqan kasharqan.
He knew it was for the best.	Payqa yacharqanmi allinpaq kasqanmanta.
He can't hold it.	Payqa manam hapiyta atinchu.
It probably should be.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanan.
They were very good people.	Paykunaqa ancha allin runakunam karqaku.
It wasn't always that easy.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna facil karqa.
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Manam segurochu kani ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
That would be the next step.	Chayqa qatiqnin ruwaymi kanman.
Now tell the truth.	Kunanqa cheqaq kaqta willay.
I think he’s a wonderful player.	Yuyaykuni payqa sumaq pukllaqmi.
And, like me, he always had a good time.	Hinaspa, ñuqa hina, payqa sapa kuti allinta pasarqa.
But today it's easy.	Ichaqa kunan punchawqa facilmi.
Everyone wants to do something with you.	Lliwmi qamwan imatapas ruwayta munan.
Such a beautiful day.	Chayna sumaq punchaw.
So he’s happy with that.	Chaymi chaywan kusisqa kachkan.
Instead, things went terribly wrong.	Aswanpas imapas llumpay mana allinchu karqa.
It doesn’t matter what it is.	Imapas kaptinpas manam imananpaschu.
There are two people.	Iskay runam kachkan.
He looked enormous, out of this world.	Payqa hatun hatunmi rikchakurqa, mana kay pachapi hinachu.
No, make it a very good thing.	Manan, chaytaqa ancha allinpaq ruway.
It was the last day of school.	Chayqa karqan escuelapi qhepa p’unchaymi.
I don't want to play again today.	Kunan punchawqa manam yapamanta pukllayta munanichu.
No, tonight was his night.	Manan, kunan tutaqa tutan karqan.
He spent a night in jail.	Huk tutam carcelpi karqa.
This same beauty.	Kay kikin sumaq kay.
And now, here you are.	Hinaspa kunan, kaypi kachkanki.
He was never right.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu rimarqan.
Can you believe it?' 	¿Creeyta atiwaqchu?’, nispa.
That is why he speaks abusively.	Chayraykum millay rimayta riman.
They are not good enough.	Paykunaqa mana allinchu kanku.
I know he was disappointed.	Yachanim hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta.
So, you never knew.	Chaymi, mana haykapipas yacharqankichu.
I can talk to him more than that.	Chaymanta astawan paywan rimayta atiyman.
This is what he wanted.	Kaymi munarqa.
Always, and immediately.	Sapa kuti, hinaspa chaylla.
The less said, the better.	Aswan pisi nisqa kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
He meant everything to me.	Payqa tukuy imatam ñuqapaq niyta munarqa.
It will do that.	Chayta ruwanqa.
And it’s very wrong.	Hinaspa ancha pantasqa.
The action sounds like it.	Chay ruwayqa uyarikun hinam.
He never exists.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kanchu.
Even if there is someone else there.	Chaypi huk runa kaptinpas.
It’s not there.	Mana chaypichu.
I didn’t want to know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta munarqanichu.
It’s really all here.	Chiqamanta tukuy kaypi kachkan.
No, nothing like that.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinaqa.
But it’s fine if you don’t.	Ichaqa allinmi mana chayta ruwanki chayqa.
I am still looking for work.	Kunankamapas llamkayta maskachkani.
But what he did was huge.	Ichaqa chay ruwasqanqa ancha hatunmi karqan.
I am sure he is well known.	Allin riqsisqa kasqanmantam seguro kani.
So both will be considered together.	Chaymi iskayninku kuska qhawarisqa kanqa.
He had no idea what was coming.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus hamunanta.
At first, I didn't want to tell you.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam willayta munarqanichu.
Maybe I’m in trouble.	Ichapas sasachakuypi tarikuni.
Like black.	Yana hina.
Now , the	Kunanqa .
I thought, maybe .	Yuyarqanim, ichapas .
I didn’t want to have sex with her again.	Manam hukmanta paywan puñuyta munarqanichu.
And we had to do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanayku karqan.
We have some of the greatest minds in the world.	Kay pachapi wakin hatun yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
Maybe it was better that way.	Ichapas chayna aswan allin karqa.
Know your limitations.	Yachay imakuna mana atisqaykita.
No, thank you no.	Manan, gracias mana.
I know you’re doing the right thing.	Yachanim allinta ruwasqaykita.
Who came up with this?.	¿Pitaq kayta yuyaykurqan?.
Everyone is happy and cheerful.	Llapallankum kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa kanku.
First, the negative.	Ñawpaqtaqa, mana allin kaq.
You don’t think so.	Manam chaynatachu yuyanki.
It’s better to have a positive attitude.	Aswan allinmi allin yuyayniyuq kay.
This is a great way to do that.	Kayqa ancha allinmi chayta ruwanapaq.
He knew what he expected to find.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima tariyta suyasqanmanta.
But tonight wouldn’t work.	Ichaqa kunan tutaqa manan allinchu kanman.
Of course, he thought he would.	Arí, payqa piensaranmi chayta ruwananta.
No one thinks you’re funny.	Manan pipas piensanchu asikunapaq hina kasqaykita.
It was about two years ago.	Yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He was exhausted but he couldn’t sleep.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan ichaqa manan puñuyta atirqanchu.
I never knew it was that good.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna allin kasqanmantaqa.
It’s so much more interesting.	Ancha aswan sumaqmi.
He couldn't understand how she did it.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imaynatas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
The process was mostly successful.	Chay ruwayqa yaqa llapanpim allin karqa.
It was very good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I can’t drive a car.	Manam carrota manejayta atinichu.
I can't believe he's serious.	Mana creeyta atinichu payqa serio kasqanmanta.
Hopefully this will help someone in the future.	Munaymanmi kayqa hamuq tiempopi pitapas yanapananta.
But you really want to do something.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwayta munanki.
He certainly did that.	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
He knew her name.	Payqa yacharqanmi sutinta.
I don’t want to get there again.	Manam munanichu hukmanta chayman chayayta.
I don’t know when.	Mana yachanichu haykapi.
Another very good thing.	Huk ancha allin ruway.
And he came to my house, how many times.	Hinaspa wasiyman hamurqan, hayk'a kutita.
So, okay, there you go.	Chaymi, allinmi, chaypi rinki.
That is, almost nothing.	Chayqa, yaqa mana imapas.
Once a teacher, always a teacher.	Huk kuti yachachiq, sapa kuti yachachiq.
And a lot of people want that.	Hinaspa achka runakuna chayta munanku.
No, it was really good.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin allin karqan.
It’s surprisingly more inaction.	Admirakuypaqmi aswan mana ruwaychu.
He looked uninjured.	Payqa mana k’irisqa hinan qhawarisqa.
You're not really here.	Manam chiqaptachu kaypi kachkanki.
I have decided to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi tantearuni.
I'd be so crazy.	Ancha loco kayman.
They were all exhausted.	Llapallankum sayk’usqa karqaku.
But no more of that now.	Ichaqa manaña chaymantaqa kunanqa.
Don’t, please don’t do that.	Ama, ama hina kaspa, chaytaqa ruwaychu.
So true, so true.	Chayna chiqap, chayna chiqap.
But I didn’t think much of it.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu yuyaykurqani.
It was crazy.	Loco kasqa.
I just don’t know why.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imarayku.
This type of thing.	Kay laya kaq.
I think it is a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruway kasqanmantam piensani.
I know what kind of person you are.	Yachanim imayna runa kasqaykita.
I’m afraid it’s me.	Manchakuni ñuqa kasqayta.
I've never really seen that happen.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa rikurqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Will it be easy, no.	Facilchu kanqa, mana.
Maybe I’ll go.	Ichapas risaq.
Some people don’t care.	Wakin runakunaqa manam imananpaschu.
This was a great moment.	Kayqa hatun rato karqan.
Maybe it could be worse.	Ichapas aswan mana allin kanman.
I don’t want to be in this house.	Manam kay wasipi kayta munanichu.
Almost every night.	Yaqa sapa tuta.
He was here, he was there.	Payqa kaypim karqa, chaypim karqa.
Either it always does or sometimes it doesn’t.	Icha sapa kuti ruwan utaq wakin kuti mana.
So you can do something with it.	Chaymi chaywanqa imatapas ruwawaq.
There was no real conversation with me.	Manam chiqap rimayqa karqachu ñuqawanqa.
Repeat the process again.	Hukmanta yapamanta ruway.
Don’t be so foolish.	Ama chayna mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
He was very impressive indeed.	Payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa chiqaptapuni.
He was the one who spoke.	Paymi rimaq karqan.
I had a wonderful day.	Ancha sumaq punchawmi karqani.
Can't wait, or .	Mana suyayta atinchu, utaq .
I don’t want you to be there.	Manam munanichu chaypi kanaykita.
So it probably isn’t.	Chaymi manapaschá.
Less than like me.	Aswan pisi ñuqa hina kasqanmanta.
He knew where they were.	Maypi kasqankuta yacharqa.
He'd probably be there all day and maybe longer.	Payqa yaqapaschá tukuy punchaw chaypi kanman hinaspa ichapas aswan unayta.
Probably about everything.	Yaqapaschá tukuy imamanta.
I’m not sure how I did it.	Manam segurochu kani imayna ruwasqaymanta.
He needs something.	Imatapas necesitan.
I’m fine with it.	Ñoqaqa allinmi kachkan.
It should be amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanan.
Will this be the case?.	¿Kaychu kanqa?.
So, we had a party.	Chaymi, huk fiestata ruwarqayku.
I felt proud of myself.	Orgulloso hinam tarikurqani.
Both are very good.	Iskayninku ancha allinmi.
This was not like him.	Kayqa manam pay hinachu karqa.
No one can stop him, no one can stop him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta atinmanchu, manan pipas hark’ayta atinmanchu.
Yes, he knew it.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi.
It just went away.	Chayllaraqmi rirqa.
I agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kachkani.
He doesn’t want to know that.	Manam chayta yachayta munanchu.
I didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqani.
He really wanted to be with her.	Payqa anchatam paywan kuska kayta munarqa.
He is here with me.	Payqa kaypim kachkan ñuqawan.
What is he after all? 	¿Imataq payqa tukuy imamanta?
He's been through this before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayta pasarqa.
I could have been a teacher.	Yachachiq kayman karqan.
A crazy guy.	Huk loco runa.
He tried to do it all night.	Chaytaqa tukuy tutan ruwayta munarqa.
It doesn’t have to be true.	Manan cheqaqchu kanan.
This is the most common failure.	Kayqa aswan riqsisqa mana allin ruwaymi.
In his own house.	Kikin wasinpi.
The process is very clear.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sut’inmi.
That’s a good thing for him.	Chayqa allinmi paypaq.
Stop trying to solve the problem.	Amaña chay sasachakuy allichayta munankichu.
Do you have any ideas?.	¿Ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki?.
He is no longer good for you.	Payqa manañan qanpaq allinchu.
I feel great about it.	Chaymantaqa anchatam sientekuni.
He was excited about something.	Payqa imamantapas kusisqan kasharqan.
One beautiful, one black.	Huk sumaq, huk yana.
That’s really sad.	Chayqa chiqap llakikuypaqmi.
Accordingly, he can do whatever he wants.	Chayman hinam munasqanman hina ruwayta atinman.
All the time, all the time, all the time.	Tukuy pacha, tukuy pacha, tukuy pacha.
But, now it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa, kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
But no one seemed hurt.	Ichaqa manan pipas k’irisqa hinachu karqan.
That will come later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi hamunqa.
But not for long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu.
What a handsome young man.	Ima sumaq rikchayniyuq wayna.
It’s one of the best.	Huknin aswan allin kaqmi.
maybe.	ichapas.
The former are happier.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan kusisqa kanku.
He did give her a chance, a chance.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin huk oportunidadta qorqan, huk oportunidadta.
That did the wrong thing.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwarqa.
Ultimately, this proved untrue.	Qhepamanmi kayqa mana cheqaqchu karqan.
So far he was right.	Kunankamaqa allintam nirqa.
He is the sure one.	Payqa seguro kaqmi.
That something should be yours.	Chay imapas qampaq kanan.
This is probably the biggest one.	Kayqa yaqapaschá aswan hatun kaq.
But one day.	Ichaqa huk punchaw.
He looked away for a long time.	Payqa maymanpas unayta qhawarisqa.
Never mind that, there wasn’t.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaymanta, manan karqanchu.
Worse, he was alone.	Aswan mana allinqa, payqa sapallanmi karqa.
Nothing was easy anymore.	Manañam imapas facilchu karqa.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allintam.
I don’t want to believe that.	Manam chaytaqa creeyta munanichu.
That’s the only thing that matters.	Chayllam ancha allinqa.
He wanted to talk to me anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas ñuqawan rimayta munarqa.
I know it won’t happen.	Yachanim mana chayna kananta.
First the easy one.	Ñawpaqtaqa chay facil kaq.
Well, good for you.	Allin, allin qampaq.
He couldn’t see it yet.	Manaraqmi rikuyta atirqachu.
He probably made the swim.	Yaqapaschá chay nadayta ruwarqa.
Stupid of me, but it was there.	Sonso ñuqamanta, ichaqa chaypim karqa.
So if you want to.	Chaymi munaspaqa.
You know it didn't go well.	Yachankim mana allintachu pasasqanmanta.
But he was caught.	Ichaqa payqa hap’isqa karqan.
So be there for it.	Chaymi chaypi kay.
He does it many times.	Achka kutitam ruwan.
It means everyone.	Tukuy runa niyta munan.
Can’t wait to hear it!.	¡Mana suyayta atiymanchu uyariyta!.
So far, nothing.	Kunankamaqa manam imapas.
Who do you want to be.	Pi kayta munanki.
I so didn't want to do this.	Ñuqaqa chaymi mana kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
I’ll do the work, good work.	Llamk’ayta ruwasaq, allin llamk’ayta.
No one could beat this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas atipayta atirqachu.
Very intelligent people.	Ancha yachaysapa runakuna.
That should be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanan.
Please do this for me.	Ama hina kaspa kayta ruway.
We sat there all night.	Tukuy tutan chaypi tiyaq kayku.
People have no idea.	Runakunaqa manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanku.
He was a big guy there.	Payqa chaypi hatun runam karqa.
This afternoon, in fact.	Kunan tarde, chiqaptaqa.
He always talked about her.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi paymanta rimaq.
Don’t do strict tasks.	Ama sinchita ruwaykunata ruwaychu.
He wants more money.	Payqa aswan qolqetan munan.
I didn’t really know what to say about it either.	Ñoqapas manan allintachu yacharqani chaymanta ima niyta.
I thought that was funny.	Chayqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I can't imagine why.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I know this may not be easy for you.	Yachanim kayqa mana facilchu kanman qampaq.
So it’s wonderful to be with him.	Chaymi paywan kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I hope you can find it one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw tariyta atisqaykita.
I am really very sorry about this.	Chiqaptam anchata llakikuni kaymanta.
He was very frightened.	Ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
Go, he seems to say.	Riy, nispas nin hina.
People seem happy.	Runakunaqa kusisqa hinam kanku.
He is here one day, there another day.	Payqa huk punchawmi kaypi kachkan, chaypi huk punchaw.
He knew he was a man.	Payqa yacharqanmi runa kasqanta.
It actually makes some sense.	Chiqaptaqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi.
You know how smart he is.	Yachankim imayna yachaysapa kasqanmanta.
I think it would have been great.	Yuyaykuni hatunmi kanman karqan.
I really like the guy.	Anchatam gustan chay runa.
There is nowhere, nowhere.	Mana maypipas, maypipas kanchu.
Didn't say much all the work.	Mana anchatachu tukuy llamkayta nirqa.
But that is not the only failure.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu chay mana allin ruwayqa.
In other words, this doesn't matter.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, kayqa manam imananpaschu.
That was the only thing that worked.	Chayllam allinpaq karqa.
Maybe it’s not always easy.	Ichapas mana sapa kutichu facilchu.
It’s bigger than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan hatunmi.
Things would have been good.	Imapas allinmi kanman karqa.
Once, then again.	Huk kuti, chaymanta yapamanta.
But first, a fact.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa, huk cheqaq kaq.
There's there's there.	Chaypi chaypi chaypi.
But so far, no one has.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He knew that a few years ago.	Chaytaqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi yacharqa.
The whole school.	Tukuy yachay wasi.
Almost scared, even more.	Yaqa mancharisqa, astawan.
Actually, that sounds different.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa huk hinam uyarikun.
But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwaymanchu.
That’s not true anymore.	Chayqa manañan cheqaqtachu.
I am not sure either.	Ñuqapas manam segurochu kani.
Or three weeks.	Utaq kimsa semana.
Unfortunately, the truth is not so simple.	Llakikuypaqmi, chiqap kayqa manam chayna facilchu.
They are something else entirely.	Paykunaqa huk imapas llapanpim.
Yes, yes he knew what he was going to do now.	Arí, arí payqa yacharqanmi kunan ima ruwananta.
But that is too easy.	Ichaqa chayqa nishuta facilmi.
He looked at that fact.	Chay cheqaq kaqta qhawarisqa.
But it wasn’t all he could do.	Ichaqa manan tukuy atisqanman hinachu karqan.
Maybe it was better here.	Ichapas kaypiqa aswan allin karqa.
I felt very unhappy.	Ancha mana kusisqam tarikurqani.
I wonder what he wants.	Tapukuni imatataq munan.
There is nothing else to say.	Manam imapas huk rimayqa kanchu.
He wasn't sure who he was.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan pi kasqanmanta.
I thought this would be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanman nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
There was no humanity.	Manam runa kayqa karqachu.
And he knew everything about everything.	Hinaspa tukuy imamanta tukuy imatapas yacharqa.
This is a huge positive.	Kayqa hatun allinmi.
Here, again, we disagree.	Kaypiqa, yapamanta, mana acuerdopichu kayku.
It doesn't look like much.	Mana anchatachu rikchakun.
I just can’t find it.	Chaylla mana tarinichu.
I am feeling much better now.	Kunanqa ancha allinmi kachkani.
He is certainly guilty.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin huchayoq.
Now go, please.	Kunanqa riy, ama hina kaspa.
Of course, we are better off without it.	Arí, mana chaywanqa aswan allinmi kanchik.
That’s the only thing that matters.	Chayllam imapaqpas allinqa.
He can’t sleep.	Payqa manan puñuyta atinchu.
Tell me about yourself.	Qanmanta willaway.
Now, that was familiar.	Kunanqa, chayqa riqsisqa karqa.
It’s all so absurd.	Tukuy imapas ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I was drunk that night.	Chay tutam machasqa karqani.
He wants me to do this thing.	Payqa munanmi kay ruwayta ruwanaypaq.
I wanted to live there.	Chaypi tiyayta munarqani.
That would be crazy.	Chayqa loco hinam kanman.
He looked rather angry.	Payqa aswan phiñasqa hinan qhawarisqa.
It was a wonderful week.	Sumaq semanan karqan.
This can be a very good thing to do.	Kayqa ancha allin ruwaymi kanman.
Now, here is the first interesting fact.	Kunanqa, kaypi ñawpaq kaq sumaq chiqap kachkan.
I want to prevent this.	Kayta harkayta munani.
I mean that in all seriousness.	Chayta tukuy serio kaypi niyta munani.
There’s something there.	Imapas chaypi kachkan.
The people are.	Chay runakunaqa.
He doesn’t want anything.	Payqa manan imatapas munanchu.
But he can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atinchu.
We walked all night.	Tukuy tutan puriq kayku.
Maybe as long as ten years.	Ichapas chunka wata hina unayta.
Maybe you can’t talk.	Ichapas mana rimayta atiwaqchu.
He wants to go in the car.	Payqa carropi riyta munan.
I would rather be in prison.	Aswan allinmi kanman karqa carcelpi kay.
I know how to handle him.	Payta imayna manejayta yachani.
Yes, he is a good guy.	Arí, payqa allinmi.
He asked me to repeat it.	Chayta yapamanta rimanaypaq niwarqa.
Unless he did it.	Manachus pay ruwarqan.
He told me he was a teacher.	Paymi niwarqa yachachiq kasqanmanta.
Instead, make a statement.	Aswanpas huk willakuyta ruway.
I can’t let this happen.	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atiymanchu.
I’m proud of this.	Kaymantaqa orgulloso kani.
But it wasn’t always bad.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu millay karqan.
I wonder who it might be.	Pitaq kanman chayta tapukuni.
She told me she was fine.	Payqa niwarqanmi allin kashasqanmanta.
Which sounds awful.	Imataq millay uyarikun.
If there is another person.	Huk runa kaptinqa.
They were tonight.	Paykunaqa kunan tutam karqaku.
It said he couldn't wait that long.	Chayqa nirqam mana chayna unayta suyayta atisqanmanta.
But it was a very short time.	Ichaqa ancha pisi tiempon karqan.
You are really doing a great job.	Chiqaptam hatun llamkayta ruwachkanki.
They're not quite there.	Paykunaqa mana ancha chaypichu kachkanku.
Everyone was fine.	Lliwmi allin karqaku.
Not yet, maybe never.	Manaraqmi, ichapas mana haykapipas.
Might make it easier to catch.	Ichapas aswan facil hapiyta ruwanman.
I saw him more than once, you know.	Aswan huk kutitam paytaqa rikurqani, yachanki.
It’s always the day.	Sapa kutim punchaw.
I’m not quite sure why this happened.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqataq kay pasasqanmantaqa.
Now I want to.	Kunanqa munani.
New like me.	Musuq ñuqa hina.
I do it all the time.	Sapa kutim ruwani.
And there he was,.	Hinaspa chaypi kasqa,.
They’ve been around for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan kashanku.
He is a prisoner.	Payqa carcelpi kaqmi.
That would have been the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi kanman karqan.
She was a homey girl.	Payqa wasi hina sipasmi karqan.
Ready playing pair.	Listo pukllaq iskay.
Not being nervous or scared.	Mana mancharisqa nitaq mancharisqa kay.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Ichapas qayna punchaw karqa.
But that is a very good statement.	Ichaqa chay rimayqa ancha allinmi.
But not as much as he can.	Ichaqa manan atisqanman hinachu.
Will go again this week.	Kay semanapi yapamanta rinqa.
You look good there.	Chaypim allinta rikchakunki.
He couldn't go.	Payqa manam riyta atirqachu.
A simple phrase would have worked.	Huk facil rimayqa allinmi kanman karqan.
Yeah, he’s a pretty good guy.	Arí, payqa allin allin runam.
She is a very lonely girl now.	Kunanqa ancha sapallan sipasmi.
This may not have gone over too well.	Kayqa manapaschá llumpay allintachu pasarqa.
I didn’t want to go there.	Manam chayman riyta munarqanichu.
They are always here.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim kaypi kachkanku.
He didn’t want to get hurt again.	Payqa manan hukmanta k’irisqa kayta munarqanchu.
We have always done that.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwarqayku.
That’s a terrible thing to do.	Chayqa manchay ruwaymi.
He knew he couldn’t stay.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana qhepakuyta atisqanmanta.
I don’t think like crazy.	Manam loco hinachu piensani.
But it wasn’t going to be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
Now you are probably a celebrity.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá huk riqsisqa runa kanki.
He didn’t know any better.	Payqa manan aswan allintachu yacharqan.
We have been together for ten years.	Chunka watañam kuska kachkaniku.
And he was fired.	Hinaspa payqa qarqusqa karqan.
That did a lot for him.	Chayqa anchatan payta ruwarqan.
But that would be a great way to do it.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
There were some really good people there.	Chaypiqa wakin chiqap allin runakunam karqa.
This had to be done quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwana karqan.
Now he's glad he didn't.	Kunanqa kusisqam kachkan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
It doesn’t matter that much.	Manam chaynataqa imananpaschu.
I don’t know that for sure.	Chaytaqa manan cheqaqtachu yachani.
He said he hoped everything would be fine.	Paymi nirqa tukuy imapas allin kananta suyakusqanmanta.
There are so many people.	Ancha achka runakunam kachkan.
I wish it had more shape.	Aswan rikchayniyuq kananta munayman.
What a good nice guy.	Ima allinta sumaq runa.
I wanted to be angry.	Phiñasqa kaytam munarqani.
I was exhausted now.	Kunanqa sayk’usqañan karqani.
Maybe it was good for him.	Ichapas allin karqa paypaq.
I really don’t know anymore.	Chiqaptaqa manañam yachanichu.
No one knew before.	Manan pipas ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanchu.
They’ve been around for a long time.	Paykunaqa unayñan kashanku.
This is where it came from.	Kayqa chaymantam hamurqa.
To the house.	Chay wasiman.
Everyone seems happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa hina kanku.
Every former player.	Sapa ñawpaq pukllaq.
This actually may not be easy for you.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa manapaschá facilchu kanman qampaq.
That was as much as he could say about it.	Chayqa chaymanta niyta atisqanman hinam karqa.
Everyone wants to see it.	Llapallankum chayta qawayta munanku.
Being an individual.	Sapa runa kay.
And again, and again, and again.	Hinaspa yapamanta, yapamanta, yapamanta.
Like, you know, man.	Imayna, yachanki, runa.
I never thought it would be so popular.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu ancha riqsisqa kananta.
But he couldn’t take the time.	Ichaqa manan tiempota hap’iyta atirqanchu.
Anyway, here goes.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim rin.
Unfortunately, he seemed happy.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
He knew it now.	Payqa kunanmi chaytaqa yacharqan.
That is all day every day.	Chayqa tukuy punchaw sapa punchawmi.
That should be lonely.	Chayqa sapallanmi kanan.
You can’t walk into it.	Manam chaymanqa puriyta atiwaqchu.
Not so ambiguous.	Mana chayna iskay yuyayniyuqchu.
I want to do the right thing.	Allinta ruwayta munani.
But much more is hard to do.	Ichaqa aswan achka ruwaymi sasa.
Who did that, he says.	Pitaq chayta ruwarqa, nispas nin.
He said he was not alone.	Payqa mana sapallanchu kasqanmanta nirqa.
He didn’t think anything wrong.	Payqa manan imatapas mana allintachu yuyaykurqan.
Seems like such a chance.	Chayna chansa hinam rikchakun.
Something very new to him.	Imapas ancha musuq paypaq.
Really, really .	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta .
How sad, really.	Imayna llakisqa, chiqap.
If it works, you keep doing it.	Allin kaptinqa, hinallam ruwachkanki.
It's faster, now.	Aswan utqayllam, kunanqa.
They were afraid of him.	Payta mancharisqa karqanku.
Two or three, actually.	Iskay kimsa, chiqaptaqa.
Several times each night.	Sapa tuta achka kutita.
I still want that today.	Kunankamapas chaytam munani.
Speaking well is a vital part of the process.	Allinta rimayqa ancha allin ruwaymi.
Making a good sound is hard.	Allin uyariyta ruwayqa sasam.
But there is room for improvement.	Ichaqa kanmi allinta ruwanapaq.
And you are mine.	Hinaspa qamqa ñuqapa kanki.
Something about him looks familiar.	Paymanta imapas riqsisqa hinam rikchakun.
Clearly this is not the case here.	Sut’inmi kaypiqa manan chay hinachu.
So stop being stupid.	Chaymi amaña sonso kaychu.
For the third time.	Kimsa kaq kutita.
It doesn’t get any easier than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan facilchu.
He had a bad day.	Mana allin punchawmi payqa pasarqa.
Who, why, how.	Pi, imarayku, imayna.
Something beautiful, silly.	Imapas sumaq, mana yuyayniyuq.
Tell them all the reasons why you can’t believe it anymore.	Willay tukuy imarayku manaña creeyta atisqaykita.
Now don’t forget that.	Kunanqa ama chayta qunqaychu.
There was no one or anything there.	Manam pipas nitaq imapas chaypiqa karqachu.
Tell me what you can.	Imapas atisqaykita willaway.
This is a two-step process.	Kayqa iskay ruwaymi.
I don't know for sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam allintachu yachani.
You couldn't say why.	Manam niyta atiwaqchu karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
They were all innocent.	Llapallankum mana huchayoq karqaku.
It wasn’t like any other.	Mana huk hinachu karqan.
That’s not a bad thing!.	¡Chayqa manam mana allinchu!.
He seemed certain.	Payqa seguro hinam karqa.
Where are they now?.	¿Maypitaq kunan kachkanku?.
It’s getting colder.	Aswan chiri kachkan.
That's easy, maybe, but it's not easy.	Chayqa facilmi, ichapas, ichaqa manam facilchu.
And then, okay.	Hinaspa chaymanta, allinmi.
So stupid, so stupid.	Chayna sonso, chayna sonso.
I would love to learn how to do that.	Chayta ruwayta yachayta anchata munani.
I've always been here.	Sapa kutim kaypi karqani.
So that’s a cruel thing to do.	Chaymi chayqa huk millay ruway.
I don’t see the car.	Manam carrota rikunichu.
I never really know.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachanichu.
It’s been a long time though.	Unayñan ichaqa.
Everything is unique.	Tukuy imapas sapallanmi.
It’s just not a very nice feature.	Chaylla mana ancha sumaq ruwaychu.
Not bad, really.	Mana mana allinchu, chiqamanta.
It was the second week.	Iskay kaq semanan karqan.
He felt drunk.	Payqa machasqa hinam tarikurqa.
He was good in the end.	Payqa allinmi karqan tukukuypi.
But he decided to do it.	Ichaqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananpaq.
But he gave it away.	Ichaqa chaytan qorqan.
Obviously, he didn’t need a letter.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan cartata necesitarqanchu.
Yes, it’s not a good thing.	Arí, manam allinchu.
I can’t do it again.	Manam hukmanta ruwayta atiymanchu.
He's fine here.	Payqa kaypi allinmi kachkan.
You want to go there.	Chayman riyta munanki.
I didn’t always do that.	Manam sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwarqani.
No, just don’t do anything.	Manan, aswanpas ama imatapas ruwaychu.
Anything anything, man.	Imapas imapas, runa.
He just opened the door.	Chayllaraqmi punkuta kicharirqa.
Nothing is certain here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas segurochu.
But that’s not true at all.	Ichaqa manan chayqa cheqaqchu ni imapipas.
We’re injured.	K’irisqa kayku.
He will be here soon.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan kaypi kanqa.
I don’t feel like me.	Manam ñuqa hinachu sientekuni.
This is obviously very very bad.	Kayqa sut’inmi ancha ancha mana allin.
But today was more difficult.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi aswan sasa karqa.
He talks about things being nice or easy.	Payqa riman imakuna sumaq utaq facil kasqanmanta.
He came with me.	Paymi ñuqawan kuska hamurqa.
I do a lot of saying no.	Achkatam ruwani mana nispa.
Please join us!!!.	Ama hina kaspa, ñuqaykuwan kuska!!!.
They are great people.	Hatun runakunam.
You go, now.	Qamqa riy, kunan.
I knew there would be more.	Yacharqanim aswan achka kananta.
Then it’s too late.	Chaymanta ancha tarde.
Do it accordingly.	Chayman hina ruway.
He's a little funny, you know.	Payqa huk chikan asikunapaq hinam kachkan, yachanki.
The result is a huge one.	Chay ruwasqanqa huk hatunmi.
You don’t think straight.	Manan allintachu yuyaykunki.
I don't always have them.	Manam sapa kutichu chaykunataqa hapini.
You know he never really knew it right.	Yachanki mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqtapuni allinta yachasqanmanta.
I know why you are mad.	Yachanim imanasqa loco kasqaykita.
Yeah, that’s pretty absurd.	Arí, chayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I couldn’t get out of here.	Manam kaymanta lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
I do something.	Imatapas ruwani.
Happy, but angry.	Kusisqa, ichaqa phiñasqa.
I always want to win.	Sapa kutim atipayta munani.
I love real food.	Ñuqaqa anchatam munani chiqap mikuyta.
That was too bad.	Chayqa sinchi mana allinchu karqan.
I mean, it’s pretty big.	Niyta munani, ancha hatunmi.
He is, of course.	Paymi, allinmi.
I didn’t want it to happen again.	Manam munarqanichu hukmanta chay pasananta.
Faster, faster, faster.	Aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla.
He doesn't want to walk.	Payqa manam puriyta munanchu.
I do things right.	Imakunatapas allintam ruwani.
This is the first one.	Kaymi ñawpaq kaq.
And, most importantly, he knows how to get there.	Hinaspa, aswan allinqa, chayman chayayta yachan.
He could not grasp the new reality.	Payqa manan mosoq cheqaq kaqta hap’iyta atirqanchu.
Again, and again and again.	Yapamanta, yapamanta yapamanta.
But it may not be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
They were always there.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim karqaku.
That seems to me.	Chayqa ñuqapaq hinam.
That sure was fast.	Chayqa seguro karqan usqhaylla.
So it’s a little uncomfortable.	Chaymi huk chikan mana allinchu.
I don’t know how that’s possible.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chay kanman chayta.
He was always with us.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqaykuwan karqa.
It’s not the best, but it will do just fine.	Manan aswan allinchu, ichaqa allintan ruwanqa.
Maybe it was the time.	Ichapas chay tiempo karqa.
It can be a while.	Huk rato kanman.
I wasn’t a good person.	Manam allin runachu karqani.
I never want to give up, ever.	Manam haykapipas saqiyta munanichu, haykapipas.
I certainly did my best.	Cheqaqtapunin tukuy atisqayta ruwarqani.
And, in fact, you could have done better.	Hinaspa, chiqaptaqa, aswan allintam ruwawaq karqa.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutim chaypi kachkan.
Can't wait for this.	Mana kayta suyayta atinchu.
What a wonderful thing to do.	Ima sumaq ruwaymi.
He always wants to do things right.	Payqa sapa kutim imatapas allinta ruwayta munan.
It would have been a tragedy.	Llakikuypaqmi kanman karqa.
All by yourself.	Tukuy sapallayki.
And then he was out.	Hinaspa chaymanta payqa hawapi kasqa.
Now here they were.	Kunanqa kaypim karqaku.
Now it’s easy.	Kunanqa facilmi.
I know you're out there.	Yachanim hawapi kasqaykita.
The result seemed amazing.	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
He was a good teacher.	Payqa allin yachachiqmi karqan.
I don’t seem to remember, well, anything really.	Manam yuyarinichu hina, allinmi, imapas chiqaptaqa.
In fact, most of the time it was.	Aswanpas yaqa llapanpim chayna karqa.
He wanted it as much as she did.	Payqa pay hinan chaytaqa munarqan.
I see no reason why it shouldn't.	Manam imaraykupas rikunichu mana chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But I refuse to believe that this is the case.	Ichaqa manan creeyta munanichu kay hina kasqanmanta.
It was really, really great.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam hatun karqa.
Now I wasn’t sure about that.	Kunanqa manañan chaymantaqa segurochu karqani.
And now it’s not.	Hinaspa kunanqa mana.
Yes, he did.	Arí chaynatam ruwarqa.
Everyone wants to know how it happened.	Lliwmi yachayta munanku imayna pasasqanmanta.
I wish he wouldn’t do anything.	Munaymanmi mana imatapas ruwananta.
This way, please .	Kay hinaqa, ama hina kaspa .
There was no better way to do that.	Chaytaqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
I think it's better for me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqapaq aswan allin kasqanmantam piensani.
So this guy really had nowhere to go.	Chaymi kay runaqa chiqaptapuni mana maymanpas rinanpaq karqachu.
It looked like a .	Chayqa rikchakurqa huk .
The only uncertainty is how many.	Chaylla mana seguro kaqmi hayka kasqanmanta.
I don't think I'm going to do that.	Manam chayta ruwanaypaqqa piensanichu.
I mean happy and sad.	Kusisqa, llakisqa ima niyta munani.
The process was not difficult.	Chay ruwayqa mana sasachu karqa.
He had to do this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanan karqa.
Here, at least.	Kaypi, aswanpas.
And the night.	Hinaspa tuta.
That’s a great moment, man.	Chayqa hatun rato, runa.
It is hard to do anything positive about it.	Chaymanta imapas allin kaqta ruwayqa sasam.
You can’t tell anyone.	Manan pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.
He didn’t need time.	Payqa manan tiempota necesitarqanchu.
That obviously wasn’t going to work.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu kanan karqan.
That phrase seems very good.	Chay rimayqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
All right, good night.	Allinmi, allin tuta.
Nowhere, nowhere, seemed safe.	Mana maypipas, mana maypipas, seguro hinachu karqan.
A little lonely world.	Huk chikan sapallan pacha.
I didn’t know why.	Mana yacharqanichu imarayku.
He’s not doing that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwashan.
Maybe it was all true.	Ichapas tukuy imapas chiqap karqa.
This action was very foolish.	Kay ruwayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
They are intelligent.	Paykunaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
He was a bit older than me.	Payqa ñoqamanta huk chhikantan kuraq karqan.
Being human is very difficult.	Runa kayqa ancha sasa.
He can’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atinchu.
I didn’t want to buy it, either.	Manam rantiyta munarqanichu, nitaq.
But, then again, maybe it is.	Ichaqa, chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas chayna kanman.
If there is one, let me know.	Huknin kaptinqa willaway.
There was nothing worse than a man.	Manam imapas aswan mana allinqa karqachu huk runaqa.
I do everything wrong.	Tukuy imatam mana allinta ruwani.
All of this sounds great.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
Never like that.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa.
He wants to do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi ruwayta munan.
He couldn't swim.	Payqa manam nadayta atirqachu.
I still think he can do it.	Hinallam piensani ruwayta atisqanmanta.
What a tough task.	Ima sinchi ruwaymi.
In fact, there is something that is not.	Aswanpas kanmi imapas mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He was the one who was hidden.	Paymi pakasqa kasqa.
However, this is the worst case scenario.	Ichaqa, kaymi aswan mana allin ruwayqa.
So there 's	Chaymi chaypi .
I'll be an injury.	Huk k'irisqa kasaq.
This made him uncomfortable.	Chaywanmi mana allintachu tarikurqa.
I know it sounds crazy.	Yachanim loco hina uyarikun.
So that had to go.	Chaymi chayqa rinan karqa.
To the house.	Wasiman.
If there is.	Sichus kan.
Everyone would be better off.	Lliwmi aswan allin kanman.
But you are doing very well.	Ichaqa ancha allintam ruwachkanki.
A great thing happened.	Huk hatun ruwaymi pasarqa.
I didn’t want that to happen.	Manam munarqanichu chay pasananta.
And okay, that's about it.	Hinaspa allinmi, chaymantam.
Please let me know what you think.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
More and more about being happy.	Aswan aswan kusisqa kaymanta.
I am bad at everything.	Tukuy imapipas mana allinmi kani.
I’m glad we did.	Kusikuni chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
Clearly this was the case.	Sut’inmi kayqa karqan.
Indeed, he probably was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa yaqapaschá karqan.
Most people want to work.	Yaqa llapan runakunam llamkayta munanku.
It was really nice to be here.	Chiqamanta kaypi kayqa sumaq karqa.
He went through it.	Paymi chayta pasarqa.
Unfortunately he is right.	Llakikuypaqmi payqa allinta rimachkan.
But yeah, it was nice.	Ichaqa arí, sumaqmi karqa.
No one knows what's going on there.	Manam pipas yachanchu chaypi ima kasqanmantaqa.
So he had to go.	Chaymi payqa rinan karqa.
I certainly don’t want that again.	Cheqaqtapunin manaña chaytaqa munanichu yapamanta.
He knew everything now.	Payqa kunanmi tukuy imatapas yacharqa.
And then, there was none.	Hinaspa chaymanta, mana karqachu.
This needs to be done very carefully.	Kaytaqa ancha allintam ruwana.
There are many people living there.	Chaypiqa achka runakunam yachanku.
We certainly did.	Chiqamanta ruwarqayku.
That’s the moon.	Chayqa killa.
I feel so lucky now.	Kunanqa ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni.
He did it every time.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwarqa.
He couldn’t help it.	Payqa manan yanapayta atirqanchu.
This is very absurd.	Kayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
First of all, it’s kind of bad.	Ñawpaqtaqa, huk laya mana allinmi.
This sounds like it could be serious.	Kayqa serio kanman hinam uyarikun.
He obviously agreed.	Payqa sut’inmi arí nisqa.
That’s why he came.	Chayraykum payqa hamurqa.
He didn’t know what it would be like.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna kananta.
go! 	riy!
all day long.	tukuy punchaw.
That was not true.	Chay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
But he doesn’t always do that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chayta ruwan.
What he did later that day.	Chay p’unchay qhepaman ima ruwasqanmanta.
He wanted to be nothing.	Payqa mana imapas kaytam munarqa.
The fact that he was there.	Chaypi kasqanmanta.
I feel very, very sad and guilty.	Ancha, ancha llakisqa, huchayoq ima sientekuni.
It 's good for you	Allinmi qampaq .
He is not sure yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu kachkan.
And that last night.	Hinaspa chay qhepa tuta.
Nobody likes it yet.	Manaraqmi pipas gustanchu.
Less intelligent people.	Aswan pisi yuyayniyuq runakuna.
Maybe a little too big, sometimes.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha hatun, wakin kuti.
That is why everything happened.	Chayraykum tukuy imapas pasarqa.
This is the one for me.	Kayqa ñuqapaq kaqmi.
But it’s just me.	Ichaqa ñuqallam.
Now he did just that.	Kunanqa chaytam ruwarqa.
He wants to do her all night.	Tukuy tutan payta ruwayta munan.
He told me that many times.	Chaynatam achka kutita niwarqa.
I know that doesn't make much sense.	Yachanim chay mana ancha yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
He was never very good at it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha allinchu chaypiqa karqan.
But this wasn’t the worst part.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan mana allinchu karqan.
Big maybe there, though.	Hatun ichapas chaypi, ichaqa.
I have nothing to do with this.	Kaypiqa manam ima ruwaytapas tarinichu.
I was never a morning person.	Manam haykapipas paqarin runachu karqani.
But that was not so easy.	Ichaqa chayqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan.
Yes, it’s as good as the first one.	Arí, ñawpaq kaq hina allinmi.
He couldn't get there.	Chaymanqa manam chayayta atirqachu.
That’s something, right?.	Chayqa imapas, ¿aw?.
He doesn’t look bad.	Payqa manan mana allinchu rikch’akun.
Sure, be sure.	Seguro, seguro kay.
He said that a long time ago.	Payqa unayñan chayta nirqan.
Instead, he did nothing.	Aswanpas manan imatapas ruwarqanchu.
Yes, we are.	Arí kanchik.
This process is constant.	Kay ruwayqa sapa kutim kachkan.
I thought it was safer.	Aswan seguro kananpaqmi piensarqani.
It was like one, two, three times.	Chayqa huk, iskay, kimsa kutita hinallam karqa.
He wants to go fast.	Utqaylla riyta munan.
He said they looked strange.	Payqa nirqam mana riqsisqa rikchayniyuq kasqankuta.
Nothing, really.	Mana imapas, chiqaptaqa.
He can’t say no.	Payqa manan mana niyta atinchu.
I'm not really hurt, you know.	Manam chiqaptachu k'irisqa kani, yachanki.
Someone had to be like that.	Pipas chayna kanan karqa.
This was not going to be easy at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas facilchu kanan karqan.
On the contrary, it is neither good nor bad.	Aswanpas manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
But then they seemed sure.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa seguro hinam karqaku.
I was a very angry teenager too.	Ñuqapas ancha phiñasqa wayna sipasmi karqani.
I didn’t always know that.	Manam sapa kutichu chaytaqa yacharqani.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqan.
More beautiful than you.	Qammanta aswan sumaq.
I'm sure, then.	Seguro kani, chaymanta.
Not yet a human being.	Manaraq runachu.
I don’t need to talk to you.	Manan necesitasaqchu qanwan rimayta.
So many unhappy people you have.	Chaymi achka mana kusisqa runakuna kanki.
Otherwise it would be bigger.	Mana chayqa aswan hatunmi kanman.
He was not quite at home.	Payqa manan allintachu wasinpi kasharqan.
We cannot be sure of that.	Chaymantaqa manam seguro kayta atichwanchu.
They were all married.	Llapallankum casarasqa karqaku.
It came to be mine.	Chayqa ñuqapa kananpaqmi hamurqa.
I am still frustrated.	Hinallam hukmanyasqa kachkani.
I didn’t do well there.	Chaypiqa manam allintachu ruwarqani.
It worked out surprisingly well.	Admirakuypaqmi allinta lluqsirqa.
But he wasn't sure he could do it.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Hopefully it will come next time.	Munaymanmi hamuq kutipi hamunanta.
So it’s nothing.	Chaymi mana imapas.
One of them was last week.	Hukninmi karqa qayna semana.
Does anyone know why? 	¿Pipas yachanchu imarayku?
It’s so easy for you.	Ancha facilmi qampaq.
They were like human beings.	Paykunaqa runa hinam karqaku.
Last looked at.	Qhipa kutita qhawarisqa.
Maybe a little too happy.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha kusisqa.
Faster and maybe meaner.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa ichapas aswan millay.
Both of them were guilty.	Iskayninkum huchayoq karqaku.
Worse when frightened or injured.	Aswan mana allin mancharisqa utaq k’irisqa kaspa.
A terrible night two weeks ago.	Huk manchay tuta iskay semana ñawpaqta.
And you’ll just have to do it.	Hinaspa chaylla ruwanayki kanqa.
About three hours.	Yaqa kimsa hora.
That’s humanity.	Chayqa runa kaymi.
It didn't work out too well in the end.	Mana ancha allintachu lluqsirqa tukukuypi.
It was a man.	Runa kasqa.
At the time, that was everything.	Chay tiempopiqa chaymi tukuy imapas karqa.
Maybe the second one.	Ichapas iskay kaq.
A little bit of reality.	Huk chikan chiqap kaq.
So far, not bad.	Kunankamaqa, mana mana allinchu.
I thought you were up to the task.	Yuyarqanim chay ruwayman hina kasqaykita.
It will usually be there.	Yaqa llapanpim chaypi kanqa.
They are all angry.	Llapallankum phiñasqa kanku.
This was the real man himself.	Kayqa kikin chiqap runam karqa.
Very good speed.	Ancha allin utqaylla.
I mean very well.	Ancha allintam niyta munani.
It was going to be a beautiful night.	Sumaq tutam kanan karqa.
Maybe a day, maybe two.	Ichapas huk punchaw, ichapas iskay.
So far, it’s not good enough.	Kunankamaqa manam allinchu.
Now you want the best song ever.	Kunanqa munanki aswan allin takiyta hayk’aqpas.
Everyone wants him.	Lliwmi paytaqa munanku.
Maybe he doesn’t want to.	Ichapas mana munanchu.
There are never two things you can do.	Manam haykapipas iskay ruwayqa kanchu.
It was not the best day.	Manam aswan allin punchawchu karqa.
I always tried to do my best.	Sapa kutim kallpanchakurqani tukuy atisqayta ruwanaypaq.
This can be a misguided approach.	Kayqa pantasqa ruwaymi kanman.
That was rather surprising.	Chayqa aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
That’s what he did, though.	Chaytan ichaqa ruwarqan.
Everything I have to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanay tiyan.
If he does not act quickly.	Mana usqhayllachu imatapas ruwan chayqa.
Everyone was outside.	Lliwmi hawapi karqa.
Rude people will continue to be rude.	Mana allin rimaq runakunaqa hinallam mana allin rimaq kanqa.
That action wasn’t here, though.	Chay ruwayqa manan kaypichu karqan, ichaqa.
Everyone knows this about me.	Kaytaqa lliwmi yachanku ñuqamanta.
There's that one new.	Chaypim chay huk musuq.
He probably likes it.	Payqa yaqapaschá gustan.
But it was quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan karqan.
Now, that would be bad.	Kunanqa, chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
I feel great this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi ancha allinta sientekuni.
As a result, both were expelled.	Chayraykum iskayninku qarqusqa karqaku.
He seemed almost pleased.	Payqa yaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
What is to be done about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwana?.
Now, however, it is not.	Kunanmi ichaqa mana.
It's all about who's the best.	Tukuy imapas pikuna aswan allin kasqanmantam.
Like, really good.	Imayna, chiqap allinmi.
I really want to see him.	Anchatam munani payta qawayta.
But, no, he’s right.	Ichaqa, manan, payqa allintan nin.
He can’t say what he wants.	Manam ima munasqantapas niyta atinchu.
He couldn't win without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam atipayta atirqachu.
Then you do it.	Chaymantaqa ruwanki.
You may not be able to do anything.	Yaqapaschá mana ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
That he was.	Pay kasqanmanta.
Being a teacher.	Yachachiq kay.
He is right, he knows it.	Payqa allintam nin, chaytaqa yachanmi.
He knows where he is.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kasqanmanta.
He can’t hold it.	Payqa manan hap’iyta atinchu.
Very very large.	Ancha ancha hatun.
Okay so maybe not yet.	Allinmi chaymi ichapas manaraq.
No .	Manam .
Otherwise, it would be fine.	Mana chayna kaptinqa allinmi kanman.
We don’t look like we used to.	Manam ñawpaqpi hinachu rikchayniyuq kanchik.
Both the same process.	Iskayninku kikin ruway.
I was a year younger than you.	Ñuqaqa huk wata sullk'a karqani qammanta.
It’s crazy, it’s terribly cold.	Loco, manchay chiri hina.
But yeah, sure.	Ichaqa arí, seguro.
I wonder what would have caused it.	Tapukuni imataq chayta ruwanman karqa.
Maybe he wanted someone more.	Ichapas munarqa pipas aswan achka kananpaq.
I’m not ready to be out in the world.	Manam listochu kani kay pachapi hawapi kanaypaq.
Something happened, man.	Imapas pasarqa, runa.
They are quick good.	Paykunaqa utqaylla allinmi.
I immediately know exactly what he is doing.	Chayllam allinta yachani imakuna ruwasqanmanta.
Be happy all the time.	Tukuy tiempopi kusisqa kay.
Is it really that important?.	¿Cheqaqtachu chay hina importante?.
For the most part, both were present.	Yaqa llapanpim iskayninku chaypi karqaku.
I want to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwayta munani.
But he knew he would, someday.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta, hayk’aqllapas.
They were wonderful in every way.	Tukuy imapipas ancha sumaqmi karqaku.
That seemed very unlikely.	Chayqa ancha manapaschá hinachu karqan.
I know he didn't mean it.	Yachanim mana chaynatachu niyta munasqanmanta.
I’ve known that for a long time.	Unayñan chaytaqa yachani.
I need to be more mindful of that too.	Ñuqapas chaymanta aswan yuyayniyuq kanay tiyan.
So things don't seem very serious.	Chaymi imapas mana ancha serio hinachu.
I can’t quit again.	Manam hukmanta saqiyta atiymanchu.
She was pretty sure of his condition.	Payqa yaqapaschá seguro kasharqan imayna kasqanmanta.
There was something about it that made sense.	Chaypiqa imapas allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He is a he.	Payqa huk paymi.
It doesn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwan.
Many people agree with me on that.	Chaymantaqa achka runakunam ñuqawan acuerdopi kanku.
But he knew the truth as well as ever.	Ichaqa ñawpaq hinan cheqaq kaqta allinta yacharqan.
That’s what you had to do.	Chaynatam ruwanayki karqa.
He says he didn’t.	Payqa ninmi mana ruwasqanmanta.
I thought it was something like that.	Ñuqaqa chayna imapas kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He is worried about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta llakisqa kachkan.
But it will come.	Ichaqa hamunqa.
He probably shouldn't have done that.	Payqa manachá chaytachu ruwanan karqan.
I know this as well as anyone.	Kaytaqa pipas hinam yachani.
In many cases.	Achka kutipi.
He’s been there a long time.	Payqa unayñan chaypi kashan.
Do this regularly.	Chaytaqa sapa kuti ruway.
About two o'clock in the morning.	Iskay tutamanta hina.
That’s a bad thing for you.	Chayqa mana allinmi qampaq.
One day it went on all morning.	Huk punchawmi tukuy paqarin pasarqa.
But he did do it.	Ichaqa payqa chaytan ruwarqan.
I had to be there with him.	Chaypim paywan kuska kanay karqa.
Very disappointed today.	Ancha hukmanyasqa kunan punchaw.
Really, really drunk.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta machasqa.
I didn’t know what to do about it.	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanayta.
Therefore, there is no such practice.	Chayraykum mana chayna ruwayqa kanchu.
It’s better not to know.	Aswan allinmi mana yachay.
Something was wrong there.	Chaypin imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
I had to do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan ruwanay karqan.
I look forward to helping out next year!.	¡Hamuq wata yanapayta suyachkani!.
No reason, really.	Mana imaraykupas, chiqaptaqa.
Of course, that is not easy.	Cheqaqtapunin chayqa, manan facilchu.
She is a teenager.	Payqa wayna sipasmi.
It’s better than it is.	Aswan allinmi imayna kasqanmantaqa.
It's a very big day for me.	Ancha hatun punchawmi ñuqapaq.
That would be great thanks.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman gracias.
One person can do that.	Huk runaqa chayta ruwanman.
I could have done it quick.	Usqhaylla ruwayta atiyman karqan.
Here is something else.	Kaypi huk imapas kachkan.
It is very good at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha allinmi.
I couldn’t think of anything else.	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
This was not true at all.	Kayqa manan imapipas cheqaqchu karqan.
Not good for you.	Mana allin qampaq.
I can see it that day.	Chay punchawmi qawayta atiyman.
But then he had an idea.	Ichaqa chaymantam huk yuyayniyuq karqa.
A couple of times.	Iskay kimsa kutita.
He really likes it.	Paytaqa cheqaqtapunin gustan.
The result was not the best.	Chay ruwayqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
I can’t talk for long.	Mana unayta rimayta atinichu.
This should be really good.	Kayqa chiqap allinmi kanan.
Yeah, that sounds good.	Arí, chayqa allintam uyarikun.
And there he goes.	Hinaspa chayman rin.
I think it is that good.	Chayna allin kasqanmantam piensani.
He sort of disagreed with it.	Payqa huk laya mana acuerdopichu karqan chaywan.
This is surprisingly important.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi ancha allin.
There may not be time soon.	Manapaschá chayllachu tiempo kanqa.
Not much there, of course.	Mana ancha chaypichu, sut’inmi.
The hardest thing in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan sasa kaq.
In fact, we both did.	Aswanpas iskayninkun chayta ruwarqayku.
I had to keep doing the job.	Chay llamkayta hinallam ruwanay karqa.
But he can’t do it alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwayta atinman.
You know you’re there.	Yachanki chaypi kasqaykita.
What a crazy year.	Ima loco wata.
No one seemed hungry anymore.	Manañam pipas yarqasqa hinachu karqa.
But he didn’t know where he was.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I still like it today.	Kunankamapas gustanmi.
He was the best.	Payqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Not sure what to do.	Mana segurochu ima ruwananmanta.
Monday last, they were.	Lunes qayna punchaw, paykunaqa karqaku.
I've always been there.	Sapa kutim chaypiqa karqani.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kashan.
I am not happy today.	Kunan punchawqa manam kusisqachu kachkani.
That one was just that.	Chay hukninmi chaylla karqa.
Not good really.	Mana allinchu chiqaptaqa.
This was a fairly easy process.	Kayqa allin facil ruwaymi karqa.
I have many, many ideas.	Achka, achka yuyayniyuqmi kani.
Of course, that wasn’t all.	Chiqamanta, mana chayllachu karqa.
I couldn’t sit with that.	Chaywanqa manam tiyayta atirqanichu.
A week passed, then two, then a month.	Huk semana pasarqa, chaymanta iskay, chaymanta huk killa.
A man who .	Huk runa, pichus .
It is not difficult to do in this day and age.	Kay tiempopiqa manam sasa ruwaychu.
That’s what went on.	Chayqa rirqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi karqan.
I'm actually kind of excited about it.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam huk laya kusisqa kachkani.
Something bigger than me.	Imapas ñuqamanta aswan hatun.

They were actually very nice to me though.	Paykunaqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku ñuqapaq ichaqa.
He said that a lot.	Chaytaqa anchatam nirqa.
He didn't seem very happy.	Payqa manam ancha kusisqachu rikchakurqa.

He couldn’t say that.	Payqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.
Maybe it was the best thing to do.	Ichapas aswan allin ruway karqa.
It was all day long.	Tukuy punchawmi karqa.
He needed no convincing.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu convencechiyta.
Just saying that.	Chaylla nispa.

Most of the time I feel tired and exhausted.	Yaqa llapanpim sayk’usqa hinaspa sayk’usqa tarikuni.

I wanted to get home.	Wasiyman chayayta munarqani.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu chhayna kan.

In fact, she was a very nice girl.	Aswanpas payqa ancha sumaq sipasmi karqan.

This was a terrible thing to do.	Kayqa manchay ruwaymi karqan.
I just saw him.	Chayraqmi paytaqa rikurqani.
I had always wanted to go there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayman riyta munarqani.
It’s already useless.	Ñam mana imapaqpas valenchu.
But, he was confused about how to do it.	Ichaqa, payqa pantasqa kasharqan imaynatachus chayta ruwananpaq.
Not three days.	Mana kimsa punchawchu.
He said he was proud of me.	Payqa nirqam ñuqamanta orgulloso kasqanmanta.

The process was quite impressive.	Chay ruwayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
But he didn’t want to, he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu, manan atirqanchu.
That was the way to do it.	Chayqa chay ruwanapaq hinam karqa.

He said he wanted something more.	Aswan imatapas munasqanmanta nirqa.
I’m great, he’s great.	Ñuqaqa hatunmi kani, payqa hatunmi.

Folks, this happened.	Runakuna, kaymi pasarqa.
Such a foolish act.	Chayna mana yuyayniyuq ruway.

He didn’t think about it at all.	Chaytaqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
I never really wanted to make it.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni chayayta munarqanichu.
It was a terrible idea.	Manchay yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
You need to do a good job with it.	Chaywanmi allin llamkayta ruwanayki.

And then he started talking.	Hinaspa chaymanta rimayta qallaykurqa.
He knew how to play.	Payqa yacharqanmi pukllayta.

Quickly caught up.	Utqaylla hapisqa.

And do it alone.	Hinaspa sapallayki ruway.
It was indeed.	Chiqaptam karqa.
But a very, very rich man.	Ichaqa ancha ancha qhapaq runa.
It’s a great way to do that.	Chaypaqqa ancha allinmi.
It was better to act innocent.	Aswan allinmi karqan mana huchayoq runa hina ruwayqa.
I know exactly what this is.	Allintam yachani ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
Nothing like last time.	Mana imapas qhipa kuti hinachu.
He knew he was here somewhere.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypipas kaypi kashasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, that didn't work out.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
Surely he would have done some things by now.	Chiqamanta kunankamaqa wakin ruwaykunata ruwanman karqa.
Or in the car.	Utaq carropi.
Why should this be so hard?.	¿Imanasqataq kayqa ancha sasa kanan?.

Then he does better.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinta ruwan.
If there are people outside.	Hawapi runakuna kaptinqa.

A lot of people, man.	Achka runakuna, runa.
Most importantly, stay positive.	Aswan allinqa, allin yuyayniyuq kay.
He looked rather unhappy.	Payqa aswan mana kusisqam rikchakurqa.
The toughest one.	Aswan sinchi kaq.
This would need to be repeated soon.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan yapamanta ruwana kanman.
There was one strange thing.	Huk mana riqsisqa kaqmi karqa.
Yesterday, really good performance.	Qayna punchaw, chiqap allin ruway.
You can't do that here.	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You know exactly why he is here.	Qamqa allintam yachanki imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
Something happened yesterday.	Imapas qayna punchaw pasarqa.
I didn’t want to do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta munarqanichu.
He didn’t want to play with her.	Payqa manan paywan pukllayta munarqanchu.
That would really do it.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwanman.
Yeah, that was the best thing that ever happened.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi karqan, chaymi aswan allin karqan.
I like them all.	Llapallankum gustan.
I thought it looked very nice.	Ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
They are no longer there.	Manañam chaypichu kachkanku.
Beautiful, he says.	Sumaq, nispas nin.
I hope so for you.	Chaynatam suyachkani qampaq.
The process should not take too long.	Chay ruwayqa manan ancha unaytachu ruwana.
Maybe that wasn’t good enough of him.	Ichapas chayqa mana allinchu karqa paymanta.
Someone opened the door.	Pipas punkuta kicharirqa.
He wanted to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwayta munarqa.
Know what time it is anywhere in the world.	Maypipas kay pachapi ima hora kasqanmanta yachay.
But, it’s not.	Ichaqa, manañam.
I just can’t remember why.	Chaylla mana yuyariyta atinichu imarayku chayta.
It said something about his personality.	Chayqa imatapas nirqam imayna runa kasqanmanta.
It does a lot of things.	Achka ruwaykunata ruwan.
I think it’s a good thing.	Allinmi kashasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
These will be very useful.	Kaykunaqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
I want someone.	Pitapas munani.
But perhaps he was on to something.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá imapipas kasharqan.
Or very early in the morning.	Utaq ancha tutamanta.
We can never do that again.	Manañam haykapipas chaynataqa atichwanchu.
That just sort of goes with it.	Chayqa chaylla huk laya rin chaywan kuska.
He couldn't get away with it.	Payqa manam chayna lluqsiyta atirqachu.
This goes without saying, but we need to do it again.	Kayqa mana niyta munanchu, ichaqa yapamanta ruwananchik tiyan.
It tells you that you are great.	Chaywanmi hatun kasqaykita yachanki.
I am really famous.	Chiqaptam ancha riqsisqa kani.
Here’s the first one.	Kaypi ñawpaq kaq.
It wasn't a big deal, he said.	Manam hatun ruwaychu karqa, nispa.
But, not everything went his way.	Ichaqa, manan tukuy imapas munasqanman hinachu rirqan.
He would soon do so.	Pisi tiempollamantan chayta ruwanan karqan.
Now you might want to see if it works.	Kunanqa ichapas qawayta munanki allinchu icha manachu chayta.
He was completely alone.	Payqa llapanpim sapallan karqa.
I just don’t know where to go from here.	Chaylla mana yachanichu kaymanta mayman rinaypaq.
It looks more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi rikchakun.
About three in the morning.	Yaqa kimsa tutamanta.
I know that is not true.	Yachanim chay mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
Why would he do that?.	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwanman?.
The latter is what did it for me.	Kay qhipa kaq ruwaymi ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
They were probably all scared.	Yaqapaschá llapallanku mancharisqa karqanku.
Both of them were bad.	Iskayninkum mana allinchu karqaku.
I don't think it's such a good thing to do.	Manam chayna allin ruwaytaqa piensanichu.
But this is not true.	Ichaqa manan kayqa cheqaqchu.
But no one knew.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu.
There may be three.	Kimsa kanman.
There he was now.	Chaypim kunan kasqa.
The guy is a guy.	Chay runaqa.
This is easy and quick to do.	Kayqa facilmi hinaspa utqaylla ruwaymi.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Payqa tukuy imatam ñuqamanta yachayta munarqa.
No, no, that you’re not.	Manan, manan, chay mana kasqaykita.
Like, ever.	Imayna, hayk’aqpas.
Everyone is there.	Llapallankum chaypi kachkanku.
But this is not true at all.	Ichaqa manan ni imapipas kayqa cheqaqchu.
I don’t want it now.	Manam kunanqa munanichu.
But obviously, it’s better not.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, aswan allinmi mana.
But they weren’t the only ones.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu karqanku.
But it won’t do anything.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas ruwanqachu.
Not sure which yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu mayqin kasqanmanta.
He knew he would win.	Payqa yacharqanmi atipananta.
That was the bare minimum.	Chayqa karqan aswan pisi kaqmi.
But at the time, nobody knew this thing existed.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan pipas yacharqanchu kay imapas kasqanmanta.
They were, as always, concerned.	Paykunaqa, sapa kuti hina, llakisqa karqanku.
But it looked great.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
But he knew he could do better than that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaymanta aswan allinta ruwananta.
Later is better.	Qhepamanmi aswan allin.
That’s why he wanted to talk to you.	Chayraykum payqa qamwan rimayta munarqa.
One of them is terrified.	Hukninmi mancharisqa kachkan.
He knew he couldn’t stay there long.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi mana unayta qhepakuyta atisqanmanta.
I thought you were funny.	Asikunapaq hina kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
It was all very sad, really.	Tukuy imapas ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa, chiqaptapuni.
As usual, I was alone.	Sapa kuti hinam sapallay karqani.
It was a really great morning.	Chiqaptam hatun paqarin karqa.
Sure you can’t do it if that’s not true.	Seguro mana ruwayta atiwaqchu sichus chay mana cheqaqchu kanman chayqa.
You can never ever tell.	Manan hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
He was all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon karqan.
But it is very fast.	Ichaqa ancha utqayllam.
He couldn’t go at all.	Mana imapipas riyta atirqachu.
But he is not like that man.	Ichaqa manan chay runa hinachu.
It doesn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwan.
He was almost angry.	Payqa yaqa phiñasqa kasqa.
No, it wouldn’t be true.	Manan, manan cheqaqchu kanman.
No, it was nothing of the sort.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
One day, one day.	Huk punchaw, huk punchaw.
But failure is not failure.	Ichaqa mana allin ruwayqa manan mana allin ruwaychu.
He wanted nothing to do with it.	Manam munarqanchu ima ruwaytapas chaywanqa.
I mean, there was a time like that.	Niyta munani, huk pacha karqan chay hina.
Maybe it doesn’t feel right.	Ichapas mana allinchu tarikun.
The latter statement is not true.	Kay qhepa rimayqa manan cheqaqchu.
That’s why it happened.	Chayraykum chayna pasarqa.
But if you don’t, it’s no big deal.	Ichaqa mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, manan hatun ruwaychu.
You know that he is.	Yachankim payqa chayna kasqanmanta.
I already feel bad about it.	Ñam chaymantaqa mana allintachu sientekuni.
I can do everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwayman.
He thought about it many times.	Chaypin askha kutita yuyaykurqan.
At least I have to be there.	Aswanpas chaypim kanay.
He's about it.	Payqa chaymantam kachkan.
I know it doesn't, not really.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta, manam chiqaptachu.
About an hour later he was ready to leave.	Huk hora hina qhepamanmi ripunanpaq listoña kasharqan.
Maybe that’s the best way.	Ichapas chayna kaptinqa aswan allinqa.
I need to be faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanay.
It’s a very serious thing to do.	Ancha serio ruwaymi.
Not so much anymore.	Manaña chaynatachu.
He was not a good man.	Payqa manan allin runachu karqan.
I am doing so much.	Ancha achkatam ruwachkani.
I don’t think it should be.	Mana chayna kananta yuyani.
The stranger is the one.	Chay mana riqsisqa runaqa.
I certainly would be.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam chayna kayman.
There and went so fast.	Chaypi hinaspa rirqa chayna utqaylla.
It's really not that bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
I was such a fool.	Chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
We were always there together.	Sapa kutim chaypi kuska kaq kayku.
What should have happened is simple.	Imachus kanan karqan chayqa facilmi.
This can be very awkward at a party.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi kanman huk fiestapi.
That should be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanan.
They were both wonderful people.	Iskayninkum sumaq runakuna karqaku.
Easier hard problem.	Aswan facil sinchi sasachakuy.
But then he didn’t need to.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan necesitarqanchu.
I'll be happy.	Kusisqam kasaq.
But he doesn't want to listen.	Ichaqa manan uyariyta munanchu.
Probably for better attention.	Yaqapaschá aswan allin qhawarisqa kananpaq.
Certainly better than one over the other.	Chiqamanta aswan allin hukmanta hukmanta.
I want to know about him.	Paymanta yachayta munani.
He knew a strange amount.	Payqa huk mana riqsisqa achkatam yacharqa.
That probably doesn’t seem right though.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu rikch’akun ichaqa.
He made the announcement.	Paymi chay willakuyta ruwarqan.
You know how it feels.	Yachankim imayna sientekusqanmanta.
So he couldn’t see it.	Chaymi mana rikuyta atirqachu.
Therein lies a problem.	Chaypin huk sasachakuy kashan.
A beautiful one.	Huk sumaq.
Obviously, he didn’t.	Sut’inmi kashan, manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
Not an adult.	Mana kuraq runachu.
I think that would have made more sense.	Chayqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
Funny, this world.	Asikunapaq, kay pacha.
I’m sorry, you can’t be this.	Pampachaykuway, manam kayta atiwaqchu.
I am not so sure about that now.	Kunanqa manam chaymantaqa chayna segurochu kani.
Do what you say you do.	Ruwasqaykita nisqaykita ruway.
I think this is the right thing to do.	Kaymi allin kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
No one thought it would happen, but it did.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu chay hina kananta, ichaqa yuyaykurqanmi.
He was obviously wrong.	Payqa sut’inmi pantasqa kasharqan.
I couldn’t say or do anything to make it better.	Manam imatapas niyta nitaq ruwayta atirqanichu allin kananpaq.
He knew what I wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqayta.
That is very easy to do.	Chayqa ancha facilmi ruwayqa.
They are the people themselves.	Chaypaqqa kikin runakunam kanku.
I’m worried about everything.	Tukuy imamanta llakisqa kachkani.
I hope it works out for you.	Munaymanmi qampaq allin kananta.
All these people.	Tukuy kay runakuna.
He didn’t want to know.	Payqa manan yachayta munarqanchu.
I would have liked to have seen him.	Payta rikuyta munayman karqan.
It still worked out well.	Hinallam allin lluqsirqa.
At the time, I couldn’t understand why.	Chay tiempopiqa manan entiendeyta atirqanichu imarayku chaytaqa.
I'm like a few others, here.	Ñuqaqa huk iskay kimsa runakuna hinam kani, kaypi.
Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna kanqa.
He's been kicked out.	Payta qarqusqa.
I’ve already been there.	Ñam chaypiqa karqani.
He can’t be sure.	Payqa manan seguro kayta atinchu.
He has to keep doing things.	Payqa hinallam imatapas ruwanan.
It is above all else.	Tukuy imamanta aswan hatunmi.
This is what I want to think about.	Kaypim yuyaymanayta munani.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Mana allin, mana allin, ancha millay.
I'm sure there is one.	Seguro kani huk kasqanmanta.
What a strong man.	Ima sinchi runa.
But he said it right away.	Ichaqa chayllam nirqa.
You’ve been there a long time.	Unayñan chaypi karqanki.
Hopefully, it does well.	Munaymanmi, allinta ruwan.
But this should be a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi kanan.
A person can do something wrong.	Runaqa imapipas mana allintam ruwanman.
They were fast, so fast.	Paykunaqa utqayllam karqaku, chayna utqaylla.
This is a very bad thing.	Kayqa sinchi mana allinchu.
Someone who is the best for you.	Pipas qampaq aswan allin kaq.
It feels extremely cold.	Chayqa sinchi chiri hinam tarikun.
They are the largest.	Paykunaqa aswan hatunmi kanku.
I think you’re very unreasonable.	Yuyaykuni ancha mana yuyayniyuq kasqaykita.
Everyone was very happy.	Llapallankum ancha kusisqa karqaku.
Most people want to be good people.	Yaqa llapan runakunam munanku allin runa kayta.
It was very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
All right, you’re all right.	Allinmi, allinmi kanki.
But he is a man.	Ichaqa payqa huk runam.
They’re angry and tired.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa, sayk’usqa ima kanku.
This is a new low.	Kayqa musuq pisi.
And he’s smart.	Hinaspa payqa yachaysapa.
People looked cold and angry.	Runakunaqa chiri, phiñasqa ima qhawarisqa karqanku.
So he was angry with her.	Chaymi paywan phiñasqa.
I saw that for a week.	Chaytaqa huk semanan rikurqani.
There was a new teacher.	Huk musuq yachachiqmi kasqa.
He can do this tough.	Payqa kayta sinchitan ruwanman.
That’s what this is all about.	Chaymantam kayqa tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
In fact, he seems impersonal.	Aswanpas payqa mana runa hinan rikch’akun.
You didn’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yacharqankichu.
This makes sense, this.	Kayqa yuyayniyuq, kayqa.
He didn’t want to hear this.	Payqa manan kayta uyariyta munarqanchu.
There was something though.	Imapas karqan ichaqa.
This was a sad situation.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He looked like he was in a hurry.	Payqa utqaylla puriq hinam rikchakurqa.
He found himself getting the job done right.	Ruwayta allinta ruwananpaqmi tarikurqa.
Okay, do something.	Allinmi, imatapas ruway.
He is such a wonderful teacher.	Payqa chhayna sumaq yachachiqmi.
They were just so fast.	Paykunaqa chaylla ancha utqayllam karqaku.
She looked amazing.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
I was disappointed in that.	Chaywanmi hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
Saying his name.	Sutinta nispa.
I mean, how could he.	Niyta munani, imaynataq payqa atinman karqan.
It is well hidden.	Allintam pakasqa kachkan.
But the night is the worst.	Ichaqa tutan aswan mana allinqa.
He wasn’t sure he could do this.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan kayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He said that was wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam nirqa.
He can do it today if he wants to.	Munaspaqa kunan punchawmi ruwayta atinman.
Nor is this the only one.	Nitaq kay sapallanchu.
Be there or .	Chaypi kay utaq .
All right, all right .	Allinmi, allinmi .
These three are amazing.	Kay kimsa runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi.
He just seemed really angry.	Payqa chiqap phiñasqa hinallam rikchakurqa.
Do nothing about what happened.	Imapas pasasqanmantaqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
Sooner rather than later.	Aswan utqaylla mana.
You know, for me.	Yachanki, ñuqapaq.
I will always be with you.	Tukuy tiempon qanwan kasaq.
But this was not true.	Ichaqa kayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
He will be at home tomorrow.	Paqarinmi wasinpi kanqa.
It’s not good at all.	Mana allinchu ni imapipas.
One must be wrong.	Hukninmi pantasqa kanan.
They are	Chaykunataqa .
I know you are worried.	Yachanim llakisqa kasqaykita.
I never had to do one.	Manam haykapipas hukta ruwanay karqachu.
Please do your best.	Ama hina kaspa, tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
Therefore,	Chaymi, .
I really can't believe this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta creeyta atinichu.
He is quite the man.	Payqa allintam chay runa.
I can’t fix it.	Manam allichayta atiymanchu.
Here, there isn’t.	Kaypiqa, manam kanchu.
But he says he was disappointed.	Ichaqa ninmi hukmanyasqa kasqayta.
I just don’t know how.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta.
That was the hardest part.	Chayqa aswan sasa kaqmi karqa.
This had nothing to do with it.	Kayqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
About a year ago.	Yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He really wanted to celebrate it.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chaymanta fiestata ruwayta.
It’s always new.	Sapa kutim musuq.
I wasn’t very happy anymore.	Manañam ancha kusisqachu karqani.
All this seems very primitive.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ancha ñawpaqmantaraqmi rikchakun.
Terrible, terrible things.	Manchay, manchay imakuna.
He soon learned how wrong he was.	Pisi tiempollamantan yacharqan imayna pantasqa kasqanmanta.
That’s how you know.	Chaynatam yachanki.
This is never a good thing.	Kayqa manam haykapipas allinchu.
I’m going to have to.	Ñuqam kanan.
That person is guilty.	Chay runam huchayoq.
There were two steps to this.	Chaypaqqa iskay ruwaymi karqan.
Do what you want with him, but don’t.	Paywan munasqaykita ruway, ichaqa ama chay hinachu.
Anyway, here are the people who were there that night.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim kachkan chay tuta chaypi kaq runakuna.
What a foolish young fool.	Ima mana yuyayniyuq wayna sonso.
Maybe a great or not great person.	Ichapas hatun utaq mana hatun runa.
He came right away.	Chayllam payqa hamurqa.
He would be the first.	Payqa ñawpaq kaqmi kanman.
That's not me being unsure.	Chayqa manam ñuqa mana segurochu kani.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
There was something there.	Chaypin imapas karqan.
Yes, that was how it was supposed to be now.	Arí, chayna kunanmi kanan karqa.
She had always been his.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi paypaq karqan.
Maybe it’s me, too.	Ichapas ñuqapas kanman.
Obviously, you’re not.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu kanki.
Nothing less than certainty would do.	Mana imapas aswan pisi seguro kaymantaqa ruwanmanchu.
He talked a lot about this.	Payqa anchatan kaymanta rimarqan.
I can live here.	Kaypi tiyayta atiyman.
This man was great.	Kay runaqa hatunmi karqa.
But it doesn’t have to be here or there.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kanan.
Why couldn’t she be mine.	¿Imanasqataq mana ñuqapa kayta atirqachu.
He can sit comfortably.	Payqa allintam tiyayta atin.
He wants an immediate answer.	Payqa chaylla kutichiyta munan.
Not alone, anyway.	Mana sapallanchu, imayna kaptinpas.
I am really worried.	Chiqaptam llakisqa kachkani.
I know why that is.	Yachanim imanasqa chaytaqa.
It must be done today.	Kunan punchawmi ruwana.
But then maybe it is.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa ichapas chayna kanman.
At the time, this was unprecedented.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas chay ruwayqa karqanchu.
But you were lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi karqanki.
That meant you were someone.	Chayqa niyta munarqa pipas kasqaykita.
I don't know where the problem might be.	Manam yachanichu maypi chay sasachakuy kanman chayta.
All night, all morning.	Tukuy tuta, tukuy tutamanta.
I’m the last one.	Ñoqaqa qhepa kaqmi kani.
I would like to see more of him.	Munayman astawan paymanta rikuyta.
But it was something on the outside.	Ichaqa hawapi kaqmi karqa.
It can mean so much that it really means nothing.	Anchatan niyta atinman, chaymi cheqaqtapuni mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
He would be a rich man.	Payqa qhapaq runan kanman.
The truth is, he did.	Chiqap kaqmi, paymi chayta ruwarqa.
Maybe he does now.	Ichapas kunanqa ruwan.
He said it never happened.	Paymi nirqa mana haykapipas chayna kasqanmanta.
Great food.	Hatun mikhuy.
He knew he was in trouble.	Payqa yacharqanmi sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
Do something there.	Chaypi imatapas ruway.
But a year later he did.	Ichaqa huk wata qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
I plan to buy more.	Astawan rantiyta yuyaykuni.
But soon, it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan, manan imananpaschu.
Tomorrow night.	Paqarin tutam.
Eat too much.	Mikhuy llumpay.
You don’t always do it fast.	Manan sapa kutichu usqhaylla ruwanki.
He didn't want to say much.	Payqa manam anchatachu rimayta munarqa.
But he seemed unharmed.	Ichaqa mana ima k’irisqa hinan karqan.
Maybe there’s more to come.	Ichapas aswan hamuq kanman.
I just don’t know what it is.	Chaylla mana yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
Like in another world.	Huk pachapi hina.
Which is absurd, really.	Imataq mana yuyayniyuq, chiqamanta.
It is here all the time.	Kaypim tukuy tiempo kachkan.
He wasn't sure what good he was doing.	Ima allin ruwasqanmanta manas segurochu kasqa.
This is a bad moment.	Kayqa mana allin rato.
He can’t do anything with it.	Payqa manan chaywanqa imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
This seems to be the first important one.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq importante hinam.
Even if yours is more secretive.	Qampa kaq aswan pakasqa kaptinpas.
Once three.	Huk kuti kimsa.
Being injured.	K'irisqa kay.
It was fine with me.	Allinmi karqa ñuqawanqa.
Everything else fails.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu ruwan.
After that, well .	Chay qhepamanmi, allinmi .
I don't feel comfortable with that.	Chaywanqa manam allintachu sientekuni.
He did that here.	Chaytaqa kaypim ruwarqa.
There is no time for that.	Chaypaqqa manan tiempon kanchu.
Instead, it will be larger.	Aswanpas aswan hatunmi kanqa.
That’s really a big problem.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin hatun sasachakuy.
I think this is very true.	Kayqa ancha chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Excess .	Aswan achka .
No, it’s better than that.	Manan, chaymanta aswan allinqa.
Ten days.	Chunka punchaw.
I feel good about this.	Kaymantaqa allintam sientekuni.
But he doesn’t think so.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu yuyaykun.
He couldn’t make money.	Mana qullqita tariyta atirqachu.
Maybe you’re not good enough either.	Ichapas qampas mana allinchu kanki.
Both are always there.	Iskayninkum sapa kutilla chaypi kachkanku.
Something is very difficult.	Imapas sinchi sasam.
In fact, it was the easiest thing in the world.	Aswanpas kay pachapi aswan facil kaqmi karqan.
He has always been here.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kaypi karqa.
Beautifully hidden.	Sumaq pakasqa.
He wants a party all the time.	Tukuy pacha fiestata munan.
That doesn’t sound right.	Chayqa manan allintachu uyarikun.
I agree this is hard though.	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani kayqa sinchi ichaqa.
But that sounds good.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi uyarikun.
He said that it was not.	Paymi nirqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
Now, that’s not going to happen.	Kunanqa, chayqa manan kanqachu.
So it was a really big deal.	Chaymi chiqap hatun ruway karqa.
And you have a .	Hinaspa qamqa huk .
He may not have been up to it, but he did.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayman hinachu karqan, ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
I don’t believe in it at all.	Manam ni imapipas creenichu.
Of course, he knew what he was thinking.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
I was in the same predicament as you.	Ñuqapas qam hinam sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
And then beauty.	Hinaspa chaymanta sumaq kay.
Pretty good food.	Sumaq allin mikhuy.
Obviously I’m a crazy person.	Sut’inmi loco runa kani.
Too bad he couldn’t finish it.	Llakikuypaqmi mana tukuyta atisqanmanta.
We did really, really well.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allinta ruwarqayku.
I’m not quite sure what happens next.	Manam allintachu yachani imakuna chaymanta pasananta.
Learn more about it.	Chaymanta astawan yachay.
One last step.	Huk qhipa kaq ruway.
It would be there.	Chaypin kanman.
I thought it was the future.	Hamuq kaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
He wouldn't want that now.	Mana chayta munanmanchu kunanqa.
It’s always.	Sapa kutim.
How did he get it right.	Imaynatataq allinta hurqurqa.
It is almost always the case.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna.
It would be very quick.	Ancha usqhayllan kanman.
I learned a lot more.	Aswan achkatam yacharqani.
They were better, maybe.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi karqanku, ichapas.
We can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atichwanchu.
Of course, he knew that was funny.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi chayqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta.
But that’s the world.	Ichaqa chaymi kay pacha.
Or the lowest one.	Utaq aswan pisi kaq.
Now there is nothing.	Kunanqa manam imapas kanchu.
I don’t think it will be bad again now.	Manam kunanqa yapamanta mana allin kananta yuyanichu.
So it’s better for you.	Chaymi aswan allin qampaq.
Maybe he doesn’t care.	Ichapas payqa mana imananpaschu.
I wasn’t nearly ready.	Manam yaqa listochu karqani.
Maybe they’re scared.	Ichapas mancharisqa kachkanku.
That’s the guy.	Chayqa chay runa.
He never agrees with me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqawanqa acuerdopichu kachkan.
As people, that’s not true.	Runakuna hinaqa, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
Maybe he couldn’t understand.	Ichapas mana entiendeyta atirqachu.
It’s not the only thing that’s popular.	Manam chayllachu ancha riqsisqa.
They are not together.	Manam kuskachu kanku.
He told me to go first.	Paymi niwarqa puntata rinaypaq.
I know what it means.	Yachanim ima niyta munan.
That was a few years ago now.	Chayqa karqa kunan iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
It seems rather sad.	Aswan llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
I’m pretty uncomfortable.	Ñuqaqa ancha mana allinchu kani.
Instead, he wants to talk to me.	Aswanpas ñoqawan rimayta munan.
I feel silly and ridiculous.	Mana yuyayniyuq, asikunapaq hinam tarikuni.
We did a lot together.	Kuska achkatam ruwarqayku.
It happened to me all the time.	Sapa kutim ñuqawanqa pasarqa.
He had no idea.	Manas ima yuyayniyuqchu kasqa.
He is not here at the moment.	Payqa manan kunan tiempopiqa kaypichu kashan.
After all, that was the old first.	Tukuy imamanta, chaymi ñawpaq ñawpaq kaq karqan.
No one really knows what’s going to happen.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan imachus kananta.
And tell it.	Hinaspa willay.
That’s a very good guy.	Chayqa ancha allin runa.
And everything is very fast.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas ancha utqaylla.
We did a lot of good things.	Achka allintam ruwarqayku.
That is, it means bad.	Chayqa, mana allin niyta munan.
It’s a senseless thing.	Mana yuyayniyuq ima.
As a result, he was very happy and excited.	Chayraykum payqa ancha kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa tarikurqa.
Best doesn’t mean good though.	Aswan allinqa ichaqa manan allinchu niyta munan.
You do it every day anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas sapa punchawmi ruwanki.
I know this is the new me.	Yachanim kayqa musuq ñuqa kasqanmanta.
So much happened.	Ancha achkatam pasarqa.
Most things, in fact.	Yaqa llapan imakuna, chiqaptaqa.
Beautiful head.	Sumaq uma.
He was involved in the whole process.	Payqa tukuy chay ruwaypi tarikurqa.
He seriously didn't say that.	Payqa serio mana chaytachu nirqa.
I can do a lot of things.	Achkatam ruwayman.
That’s what’s said here.	Chayqa kaypi nisqa.
She couldn’t stand it, but it was okay.	Payqa manan aguantayta atirqanchu, ichaqa allinmi karqan.
I couldn't work yet.	Manaraqmi llamkayta atirqanichu.
And that’s doubly funny.	Hinaspa chayqa iskay kutita asikunapaq.
That's all it ever was.	Chayllam haykapipas karqa.
I mean, he’s a teacher.	Niyta munani, payqa yachachiqmi.
You can do whatever you want with it.	Chaywanmi munasqaykita ruwawaq.
I'm sure that's what did it.	Seguro kani chaymi chayta ruwarqa.
He couldn't stay here with her, he couldn't.	Payqa manan kaypi paywan qhepakuyta atirqanchu, manan atirqanchu.
He is at home with you.	Payqa qanwan kuskan wasipi kashan.
I don’t have much intelligence.	Manam ancha yuyayniyuqchu kani.
He has always wanted to be a designer.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi munarqa imapas ruwaq runa kayta.
I feel sicker and sicker.	Aswan unqusqa, aswan unqusqa ima sientekuni.
A few other things.	Huk iskay kimsa imakunatapas.
I really, really will.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam ruwasaq.
He knew it was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi hamunanta.
He never needed anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas necesitarqanchu.
You're so stupid.	Ancha sonso kanki.
But he was certainly more than anxious to do so.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwananpaqqa aswan llakisqa kasharqan.
The moment where you want the best.	Chay rato maypichus aswan allinta munanki.
Don’t be a bad guy.	Ama mana allinchu kay.
That’s almost crazy.	Chayqa yaqa loco kaymi.
I’m not going to agree.	Manam acuerdopichu kasaq.
Less than an hour, anyway.	Manaraq huk hora, imayna kaptinpas.
The most beautiful thing in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan sumaq kaq.
The truth is, they are not.	Cheqaq kaqmi, manan chay hinachu kanku.
You’re really curious about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa anchata yachayta munanki.
Maybe he can wait.	Ichapas suyayta atinman.
He spends a lot of time thinking about it.	Payqa askha tiempotan chaypi yuyaykushan.
He doesn’t know how to do it.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna ruwananta.
Are you not in anything.	¿Manachu imapipas kanki.
I know you will do this.	Yachanim kayta ruwanaykita.
I thought it was beautiful.	Sumaq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
He wanted it to be that way.	Chayna kananpaqmi munarqa.
Wealth means prestige.	Qhapaq kayqa allinpaq qhawarisqa kaytan.
That’s not always a good thing to do.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu allin ruway.
But that won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chayqa kanqachu.
I’m going to talk to him today.	Kunanmi paywan rimaq risaq.
So he did this.	Chaymi kayta ruwarqa.
It doesn’t do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwanchu.
He has done this walk before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kay puriyta ruwarqa.
But what he said about me wasn’t true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu karqan ñoqamanta nisqanqa.
He had always been there.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi kasqa.
Yes, yes, that will be better.	Arí, arí, chayqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
He was alone here.	Payqa sapallanmi kaypi kasqa.
This would be the only chance.	Kaymi kanman sapallan chansa.
Please don’t let that mean that it is.	Ama hina kaspa, ama chaytaqa chayna kasqanmanta niyta munanchu.
It is still the same today.	Kunankamapas chayna hinallam kachkan.
Plus, here’s the real beauty.	Astawan, kaypi chiqap sumaq kay kachkan.
That would have been so easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi kanman karqa.
But that’s what I did.	Ichaqa chaytam ruwarqani.
It was almost nice actually.	Yaqa sumaqmi karqa chiqaptaqa.
Tomorrow is here.	Paqarinmi kaypi kachkan.
I really, really want to live here.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta kaypi tiyayta munani.
A large black.	Huk hatun yana.
This is the possibility.	Kaymi kanman.
Anyway I think tomorrow.	Imayna kaptinpas paqarinmi yuyani.
I need help now.	Kunanmi yanapayta necesitasaq.
He was black, sadly sick.	Payqa yana, llakisqa unqusqa.
That wasn’t funny.	Chayqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
Maybe she can talk to him.	Ichapas paywan rimayta atinman.
He’s not really a villain.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu millay runa.
If you want to see it, you better hurry.	Sichus rikuyta munanki chayqa, aswan allinmi usqhaylla ruway.
But most people can talk.	Ichaqa yaqa llapa runan rimayta yachanku.
He didn’t take much convincing.	Payqa manan anchatachu convencechiyta hap’irqan.
This is a human being.	Kayqa huk runam.
If it is there, you are fine.	Chaypi kaptinqa allinmi kachkanki.
I love talking to you.	Anchatan gustan qanwan rimayqa.
He wants to talk.	Rimayta munan.
And, after all, you’ll do well.	Hinaspa, tukuy imamanta, allinta ruwanki.
He was a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runa kasqa.
She didn't know what he wanted from her.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imatachus paymanta munasqanmanta.
Everything here is mine.	Kaypi tukuy imapas ñuqapa.
At this point, he couldn’t tell.	Kaypiqa, mana yachayta atirqachu.
This was very unlike him.	Kayqa ancha mana pay hinachu karqa.
Still, he had to be there.	Chayna kaptinpas chaypim kanan karqa.
It looked like you, too.	Qampas hinam rikchakurqa.
And here’s another one.	Hinaspa kaypi huk.
Hopefully someone else can help with this.	Munaymanmi huk runa kaypi yanapananta.
I’m not good at it all the time.	Manam allinchu kani chaypi sapa kutilla.
This would be the first time.	Kayqa ñawpaq kutim kanman.
He was absolutely amazing in every way.	Payqa tukuy imapipas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
You don’t have to pretend to be something you’re not.	Manan imapas mana kasqaykita hinachu ruwanayki.
But he knows things.	Ichaqa payqa yachan imakunatapas.
You want to be a better person.	Aswan allin runa kaytam munanki.
Not crazy in the past.	Mana loco ñawpaqpi.
He really wanted to get out, he really did.	Payqa anchatam lluqsiyta munarqa, chiqaptam lluqsirqa.
Next year, yes.	Hamuq wata, arí.
I haven’t felt very well in a long time.	Unayñan mana ancha allintachu sientekuni.
They are just like me.	Paykunaqa ñuqa hinam kanku.
I didn’t listen to much.	Manam anchatachu uyarirqani.
I know he can do it.	Yachanim chay ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Not all there is.	Mana tukuy chaypichu.
Actually, he probably wasn’t sure.	Chiqaptaqa manapaschá segurochu karqa.
He was a very, very nice man.	Payqa ancha, ancha sumaq runam karqa.
I can’t say why.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That night he told me you didn’t know.	Chay tutam niwarqa mana yachasqaykita.
I wasn’t very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu karqani.
I didn’t notice either.	Ñuqapas manam repararqanichu.
It was crazy, if you think about it.	Loco karqan, sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
I had never heard of this before.	Kaytaqa manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu.
And it was actually a big deal.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
That’s how I am ugly.	Chay hinam kani millay.
There’s something there.	Chaypim imapas kachkan.
Not always, but not always.	Mana sapa kutichu, ichaqa mana sapa kutichu.
It was nothing like this.	Manan imapas kay hinachu karqan.
This is better for you.	Kayqa aswan allinmi qampaq.
Most people agree on that.	Yaqa llapa runakunam chaymantaqa acuerdopi kanku.
So without doing that.	Chaymi mana chayta ruwaspa.
We sat there twice a day.	Sapa punchawmi iskay kutita chaypi tiyaq kayku.
This is actually pretty simple.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allin sasam.
This is the important thing.	Kaymi chay importante kaq.
A cup of coffee.	Huk kukata kukata.
You can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiwaqchu.
It’s very difficult for you.	Ancha sasam qampaq.
But that's the other one.	Ichaqa chaymi huknin kaq.
Do you know where it is? 	¿Yachankichu maypi kasqanmanta?
He was always very sure that he knew better.	Payqa sapa kutim ancha seguro karqa aswan allinta yachasqanmanta.
He told me he was sick himself.	Pay kikin unqusqa kasqanmantam niwarqa.
Eventually you will learn this new language.	Qhepamanmi kay mosoq simita yachanki.
She’s beautiful and good.	Payqa sumaqmi, allinmi.
No, no, it’s okay.	Manan, manan, allinmi.
I'll most certainly do this again.	Aswan seguro kayta ruwasaq yapamanta.
That seems like a long time ago now.	Chayqa kunanqa unayñan rikch’akun.
I don’t think that’s true.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu, nispan yuyaykuni.
He was really very nice though.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq karqa ichaqa.
I’m doing a bad job.	Mana allintam ruwani.
Repeat this over and over again.	Chayta yapamanta yapamanta ruway.
Maybe a little happy.	Ichapas huk chikan kusisqa.
So, by two o’clock you’re ready.	Chaymi, iskay horaskama listoña kasqaykita.
They are no longer happy.	Paykunaqa manañam kusisqachu kanku.
You don’t know what kind.	Mana yachankichu ima laya.
But what if he doesn't.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman mana chayta ruwaptinqa.
Here is the most important thing.	Kaypiqa aswan importante kaqmi kachkan.
And that was a bad thing to do.	Hinaspa chayqa mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
I hope you can do well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwayta atisqaykita.
Anything, everything.	Imapas, tukuy imapas.
Sure enough, someone actually did.	Seguro, cheqaqtapunin pipas chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I thought he was a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
That’s a whole different process.	Chayqa huk chikan ruwaymi.
So that gave me half the game.	Chaymi chaymi kuskan pukllayta quwarqa.
Everything will be as usual, actually.	Tukuy imapas sapa kuti hinam kanqa, chiqaptaqa.
Tell me everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata willaway.
Yes or no.	Arí icha mana.
What is he so scared of.	Imamantataq ancha mancharisqa kachkan.
She is a very beautiful young woman.	Payqa ancha sumaq sipasmi.
Everything about him looked tired.	Paymanta tukuy imapas sayk’usqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Midnight in the morning.	Kuska tutamanta.
What’s wrong with that.	Imataq mana allin.
Every day was like every other day.	Sapa punchawmi sapa iskay punchaw hina karqa.
That one, that one.	Chay huknin, chay huk.
It was such a beautiful night.	Chayna sumaq tutam karqa.
I didn't expect it to be so fast.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna utqaylla kananta.
That meant it.	Chayqa niyta munarqa.
But that is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chayqa kanchu.
Maybe this, really.	Ichapas kay, chiqap.
So be real about it.	Chaymi chaymanta chiqap kay.
And now, here you are, unscathed.	Hinaspa kunan, kaypi kashanki, mana ima k’irisqa.
No one knows what that might be about.	Imamantataq chay kanman chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
He wasn't the bad guy.	Payqa manam chay millay runachu karqa.
So, you know .	Chaymi, yachanki .
I would have to disagree there.	Chaypiqa mana acuerdopichu kanay kanman.
He knew he would help her.	Payqa yacharqanmi yanapananta.
No one was ever serious.	Manam haykapipas pipas serio karqachu.
He stayed with us for a while.	Payqa huk tiempon ñoqaykuwan qhepakurqan.
I am a very lonely person.	Ancha sapallan runam kani.
It makes more sense.	Aswan yuyayniyuqmi.
But this was so much more than that.	Ichaqa kayqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi karqan.
He’s the last man now.	Payqa kunanmi qhepa kaq runa.
He knows that it is.	Payqa yachanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
He did come.	Payqa chiqaptam hamurqa.
I would like to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munayman.
I want to think about that.	Chaypin yuyaymanayta munani.
You’d never want to say anything.	Manan hayk’aqpas imatapas niyta munawaqchu.
It’s really good for you.	Chiqaptam allin qampaq.
I always knew all of them.	Llapallankum sapa kutilla yacharqani.
He wasn’t alone in this.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kaypi karqan.
It should be something you need to do.	Chayna kaptinqa imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi kanan.
He was so tired of being alone, and alone.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa sapallan kasqanmanta, hinaspa sapallan kasqanmanta.
He’s the one I thought of.	Paymi yuyaykurqani.
I think that's pretty much it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmantaqa piensani.
He wouldn’t be able to hear her.	Payqa manan uyariyta atinmanchu karqan.
He adapted well.	Payqa allintan chayman hina ruwarqan.
I don’t want to sit there.	Manam chaypi tiyayta munanichu.
But no one knows exactly how much is safer.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan hayk’a aswan seguro kasqanmanta.
I know you are right.	Yachanim allinta nisqaykita.
It’s not like that.	Manan chay hinachu.
Or, or, or.	Utaq, utaq, utaq.
Good morning, everyone.	Allin punchaw, llapallanku.
I was no longer the same person.	Manañam kikin runachu karqani.
He said I was cold all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chiri kasqayta nirqa.
Happy with everything.	Tukuy imamanta kusisqa.
If there had been.	Sichus karqan chayqa.
He was obviously too upset.	Payqa sut’inmi nishuta phiñasqa kasharqan.
Probably something else.	Yaqapaschá huk imapas.
This was a scared kid.	Kayqa mancharisqa wawa kasqa.
I hear it once.	Huk kutitam uyarini.
He is not ready.	Payqa manan listochu kashan.
He was never truly happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaq kusisqachu karqan.
Every day, more.	Sapa punchaw, astawan.
No one wants to see it.	Manam pipas qawayta munanchu.
Another great success.	Huk hatun allin ruway.
Monday is not a good day for me.	Lunes punchawqa manam allinchu ñuqapaq.
To keep him busy.	Ocupasqa kananpaq.
I did well there.	Chaypin allinta ruwarqani.
Yes, it is, of course.	Arí, allinmi, nispa.
That sounds extremely difficult.	Chayqa sinchi sasa uyarikun.
You said it all before.	Ñawpaqtaqa tukuy chaytan nirqanki.
Everything is miserable.	Tukuy imapas llakikuypaqmi.
There is nothing like this.	Kay hinaqa manan imapas kanchu.
Now actually do it.	Kunanqa chiqaptapuni ruway.
It was wonderful here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Probably the best way to go.	Yaqapaschá aswan allinqa kanman.
You’re the best, baby!.	¡Qanmi aswan allin kanki, wawa!.
Hopefully, this is where I’m going.	Munaymanmi, kaymi mayman rinaypaq.
There is no third party.	Manam kimsa kaq kanchu.
And in the morning.	Hinaspa tutamanta.
It sounds absurd.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi uyarikun.
But he's not sure he's there alone.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan sapallan chaypi kasqanmanta.
One hour, then two.	Huk hora, chaymanta iskay.
He never needed it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas necesitarqanchu.
He said nothing about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa nirqanchu.
They are too fast.	Paykunaqa llumpay utqayllam kanku.
Okay, once again.	Allinmi, huk kutipi.
You can’t say it doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu niyta atiwaqchu.
Again, not sure why.	Yapamanta, mana segurochu imarayku.
How could he not.	Imaynataq mana atinmanchu karqa.
More than once, in fact.	Aswan huk kuti, chiqaptaqa.
Does anyone have any thoughts on this ?.	¿Pipas kaymanta yuyayniyuqchu ?.
He probably went with her.	Yaqapaschá paywan kuska rirqa.
The second is the	Iskay kaqmi.
Tired, more tired than he is.	Sayk’usqa, paymanta aswan sayk’usqa.
Sure you were right.	Seguro allinmi karqanki.
It’s very unpleasant,’ he says.	Ancha mana sumaqmi’, nispas nin.
Both very rich, both very successful.	Iskayninku ancha qhapaq, iskayninku ancha allin ruwaq.
I know that is hard.	Yachanim chayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
No one knows where you are now.	Manan pipas yachanchu kunan maypi kasqaykita.
The first night is miserable.	Ñawpaq tutaqa llakikuypaqmi.
Not a good head day.	Mana allin uma p’unchawchu.
Now is the time.	Kunanmi chay tiempo.
But he couldn’t hold one now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa hukta hap’iyta atirqanchu.
They are not true.	Mana chiqap kasqankuta.
This would be very obvious.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi kanman.
It is confused about everything.	Tukuy imamanta pantasqa kachkan.
I feel really lonely.	Chiqamanta sapallay sientekuni.
You were a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runam karqanki.
This is a kind of.	Kayqa huk laya.
He will be there.	Payqa chaypim kanqa.
If so, please let me know.	Chayna kaptinqa, willaway.
The men were tired and hungry.	Chay runakunaqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima karqanku.
It was a really special day.	Chay punchawqa chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
He's serious about it.	Payqa chaymantam serio kachkan.
We’re strongly invested in this.	Kaypiqa sinchitan churasqa kayku.
I think this is great.	Kayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi yuyaykuni.
But that would speed up the process.	Ichaqa chaywanqa usqhayllan chayta ruwanman.
I feel sorry for him if that’s the case.	Paymanta llakikuni sichus chayna kaptinqa.
But it had to be tomorrow.	Ichaqa paqarinmi kanan karqan.
He never thought anything would come of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu chaymanta imapas hamunanta.
He is a depressed man.	Payqa llakisqa runam.
I think he’s the nicest person in the world.	Yuyaykuni payqa kay pachapi aswan sumaq runa kasqanmanta.
It really had no idea.	Chiqamanta mana ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
It is still not enough.	Kunankamapas manam chayllachu.
Maybe you haven’t been there yet.	Ichapas manaraq chaypichu karqanki.
And if so, good for you.	Hinaspa chayna kaptinqa, allinmi qampaq.
You cannot tell this to anyone.	Kaytaqa manam pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.
I didn't, either, for that matter.	Ñuqapas manam ruwarqanichu, chaypaqqa.
There are some, however.	Wakin ichaqa kanmi.
He knows what what is.	Payqa yachanmi ima ima kasqanmanta.
We did that a long time ago.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwarqayku.
I didn’t see him at all.	Manam paytaqa ni imapipas rikurqanichu.
This gave me a funny sense of disappointment.	Kaymi huk asikunapaq hina hukmanyasqa kayta quwarqa.
But you can never tell.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
So it’s very stupid.	Chaymi ancha sonso.
If anything, it was great.	Imapas kaptinqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I couldn't figure this out.	Kaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun wayna kasqa.
You, at least.	Qam, aswanpas.
Me more than you, he said.	Ñuqa aswan qammanta, nispas nisqa.
Not just that, for sure.	Mana chayllachu, seguro.
And, every morning after that.	Hinaspa, sapa paqarin chaymanta.
Today we have to do it in the past.	Kunan tiempopiqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ruwananchik.
Everything felt right.	Tukuy imapas allinpaq hinam tarikurqa.
It was obviously good.	Sut’inmi allin karqan.
Happiness is a good thing.	Kusisqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
He said it was good for you.	Paymi nirqa qampaq allin kasqanmanta.
How things should be.	Imaynataq imapas kanan.
This man never did anything right.	Kay runaqa manam haykapipas allintachu imatapas ruwarqa.
That will be the most important thing.	Chayqa aswan importante kaqmi kanqa.
I feel great about it.	Chaywanmi anchata sientekuni.
To make sure it’s right.	Allin kasqanmanta seguro kananpaq.
And he went in there.	Hinan payqa chayman haykurqan.
Surprisingly, he's pretty much right.	Admirakuypaqmi, payqa yaqa allintam rimachkan.
No one could have stopped it.	Manan pipas chaytaqa hark’ayta atinmanchu karqan.
Teacher in the school.	Yachay wasipi yachachiq.
No, it will be safer.	Manan, aswan seguro kanqa.
He loves to talk.	Payqa anchatam munan rimayta.
But for the most part, everything worked out.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim tukuy imapas allin karqa.
That kind of thing.	Chay laya kaq.
You know what you want to do and why.	Yachankim ima ruway munasqaykita hinaspa imanasqa.
Now he is the one.	Kunanqa paymi kachkan.
There will be a lot of people there.	Chaypin askha runakuna kanqa.
One, two, three hours	Huk, iskay, kimsa pacha .
I didn’t do that either.	Ñoqapas manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He couldn’t understand.	Mana entiendeyta atirqachu.
Perhaps he did.	Yaqapaschá chaynata ruwarqa.
Own house.	Kikin wasi.
Where is the wrong?.	¿Maypitaq mana allin?.
They are angry and scared.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
I was willing to do just about anything.	Yaqa tukuy imatapas ruwanaypaqmi listo karqani.
So then it’s.	Chaymi chaymantaqa.
It’s surprisingly easy to do.	Admirakuypaqmi facil ruwayqa.
But seriously, people.	Ichaqa serio, runakuna.
He wanted to talk about it.	Payqa chaymanta rimayta munarqa.
Nothing at all here.	Mana imapas kaypiqa.
He said he didn't want to quit.	Paymi nirqa mana saqiyta munasqanmanta.
Whether he was serious or not, he was right.	Serio kaptinpas mana serio kaptinpas allintam rimaq.
They want to be safe.	Paykunaqa munanku seguro kayta.
I never wanted to see it again.	Manam haykapipas hukmanta qawayta munarqanichu.

But he can't drive.	Ichaqa manan carrota manejayta atinchu.
Now the.	Kunanqa chay...
They are all smart.	Llapallankum yachaysapa kanku.
It would be better not to.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chayta ruwayqa.

They will never adapt.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayman hinachu kanqa.
It’s not good but it’s there.	Manam allinchu ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
You’ll be fine for now.	Kunankamaqa allinmi kanki.
He seemed very impressed by the result.	Payqa ancha admirasqa hinam karqa chay ruwasqanmanta.
It’s not me.	Mana ñuqachu.
Good, better, better.	Allin, aswan allin, aswan allin.
Anyone has a chance to be here.	Pipas kanmi chansa kaypi kananpaq.
I know not to talk about it.	Chaymanta mana rimayta yachani.
They were there the whole time.	Paykunaqa tukuy tiempon chaypi karqanku.

He never said it would be easy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas nirqanchu facil kananta.
I would like him back, please.	Munaymanmi kutimunanta, ama hina kaspa.
Tonight could be better.	Kunan tutaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I never thought he would do anything.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu ima ruwaytapas ruwananpaqqa.
Happy week ahead.	Kusisqa semana hamuq.
He refused to come.	Payqa manas hamuyta munarqanchu.
He knows he will.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwananta.
Now everyone is here.	Kunanqa llapa runam kaypi kachkan.
He was happy there.	Chaypim kusisqa kasqa.
People are not there yet.	Runakunaqa manaraqmi chaypichu kachkanku.
Either you were the real thing or you weren't.	Icha qam chiqap kaq karqanki icha manachu karqanki.
There is more, however.	Aswanpas kanmi ichaqa.
All the best .	Llapan allin .
Yes, he went through it.	Arí, payqa chaynatam pasarqa.
So he couldn’t do it.	Chayraykum mana ruwayta atirqachu.
He will be very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
He always did this to her.	Chaynataqa sapa kutim paytaqa ruwaq.
I don’t think about who I am.	Manam pi kaypichu piensani.
Almost a head less than you.	Yaqa huk uma aswan pisi qammanta.
They are the only ones.	Paykunaqa chayllaraqmi kanku.
I can’t be like this again.	Manan hukmanta kay hina kayta atiymanchu.
Anything less is in trouble.	Imapas aswan pisi kaqmi sasachakuypi tarikun.
No one was there anyway.	Manam pipas chaypichu karqa imayna kaptinpas.
We’re really, really good at it.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin kayku chaypi.
He wants to get home, he wants to see her.	Payqa wasinman chayayta munan, payta rikuyta munan.
But it’s still beautiful.	Ichaqa kunankamapas sumaqmi.
They were all proud.	Llapallankum orgulloso karqaku.
Yes, he really wanted to talk.	Arí, payqa anchatam rimayta munarqa.
He with you, I’m sure.	Pay qanwan, seguro kani.
I like being alone.	Sapallan kaymi gustan.
You want to remember that.	Chayta yuyariyta munanki.

Man always wants more.	Runaqa sapa kutim aswan achkata munan.
I don’t think about anything.	Manam imapipas piensanichu.
It’s better to be smart.	Aswan allinmi yachaysapa kay.
Just saying, be nice to her.	Chaylla nispa, paywan sumaq kay.
This is what came out.	Kaymi lluqsirqa.
That seems to be the case.	Chayqa kanan hinam.
If this is you, you’re in luck.	Sichus kay qan kanki chayqa, suerteyoqmi kanki.
But he was worried.	Ichaqa llakisqa kasharqan.
One is always on if the other is on.	Hukninmi sapa kuti llank’ashan sichus huknin llank’ashan chayqa.
You know how it is.	Yachankim imayna kasqanmanta.
That’s nice, but it won’t work.	Chayqa sumaqmi, ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
I take that seriously.	Chaytaqa allintam hapini.
The more, the merrier.	Aswan achka kaptinqa, aswan kusisqam.
We are always positive.	Sapa kutim allin yuyayniyuq kanchik.
You were there and then you weren’t.	Chaypi karqanki chaymanta mana.
Anyway, what do you do.	Imayna kaptinpas, imatataq ruwanki.
Maybe too seriously.	Ichapas ancha serio.
I am very happy with all of them.	Llapallankum anchata kusikuni.
I can't really stand it.	Manam chiqaptachu chayta aguantayta atiyman.
They’re tough, and that’s a good thing.	Paykunaqa sinchi kanku, chayqa allinmi.
You don’t know how to fix it.	Mana yachankichu imayna allichayta.
And rightly so.	Hinaspa allinta.
That's ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam.
That wouldn’t have been right.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman karqan.
He was a guy, after all.	Payqa huk wayna karqan, tukuy imamanta.
Now say something.	Kunanqa imatapas niy.
And now someone wanted to tell him again.	Hinaspa kunanqa pipas yapamanta willayta munarqa.
I shouldn't be here, I'm not sure.	Manam kaypichu kanay, manam segurochu.
Maybe it’s too nice.	Ichapas ancha sumaq.
I was a little excited.	Huk chhikantan kusisqa karqani.
A good tired one.	Huk allin sayk’usqa.
He probably knew why he was here.	Yaqapaschá yacharqan imarayku kaypi kasqanmanta.
Which is kind of good, maybe not a big deal.	Imataq huk laya allin, ichapas mana hatun ruwaychu.
It just didn’t work out that way.	Chaylla mana chaynatachu lluqsirqa.
But he thinks right.	Ichaqa allintan yuyaykun.
That’s the best part about it.	Chayqa chaymanta aswan allin kaqmi.
A few hours later he looked up.	Iskay kinsa hora qhepamanmi qhawarirqan.
This means you are.	Kayqa qanmi niyta munan.
The first one, anyway.	Ñawpaq kaq, imayna kaptinpas.
No one told him to do it.	Manan pipas nirqanchu chayta ruwananpaq.
This, in fact, happened.	Kayqa, chiqaptaqa, pasarqa.
And he knows it.	Hinaspa yachan.
But he didn't want to deal with it at the time.	Ichaqa manan chay tiempopiqa chayta atipayta munarqanchu.
The night is cold.	Tuta chiri.
That was before last summer.	Chayqa karqan qayna verano wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
More like two weeks.	Aswan iskay semana hina.
He said he was fine, fine.	Payqa allinmi, allinmi nispas nisqa.
I couldn’t quit fast enough.	Manam utqaylla saqiyta atirqanichu.
So we made a story.	Chaymi huk willakuyta ruwarqayku.
Today, was not a bad day.	Kunan punchaw, manam mana allin punchawchu karqa.
I can't help but feel overwhelmed.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atinichu llumpay hukmanyasqa tarikuni.
It’s by no means the next step.	Manan imaraykupas qatiqnin ruwaychu.
Maybe he’s right, maybe he’s not.	Ichapas payqa allinta rimachkan, manapaschá.
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chay rimayta munarqanichu.
I take a second cup of coffee, as before.	Iskay kaq kukata hap’ini, ñawpaq hina.
Everything is in the making.	Tukuy imapas ruwaypi kachkan.
I am a very bad person.	Ancha millay runam kani.
He always came in the morning.	Payqa sapa kutim tutamanta hamuq.
That’s how it felt.	Chayna hinam tarikurqa.
Like, the real thing.	Imayna, chiqap imapas.
That’s what you think.	Chaynatam yuyanki.
Better that way.	Aswan allin chay hina.
Do it wrong more than once.	Aswan kutita mana allinta ruway.
That’s what he’s thinking.	Chaytan payqa yuyaykushan.
It was sad really.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa chiqaptapuni.
This presented him with a problem.	Chaywanmi huk sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Now it's finally here.	Kunanqa tukukuypi kaypi kachkan.
I'm very quick.	Ancha utqayllam kani.
You don’t really want to know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachayta munanki.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manan facil ruwaychu karqan.
How does he know.	Imaynatataq yachan.
It was exhausted.	Chayqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
He knew that beforehand.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqa.
Yeah, sure .	Arí, seguro .
Tom doesn’t care anymore.	Tomqa manañan imananpaschu.
I am so sorry for a night out.	Anchatam llakikuni huk tutamanta.
He had never felt so alone.	Manam haykapipas chayna sapallanchu tarikurqa.
No, no, he says.	Manan, manan, nispas nin.
Ten years passed.	Chunka wata pasarqa.
I couldn’t do it either.	Ñuqapas manam atirqanichu.
You are your own person.	Kikin runam kanki.
He didn’t want to hold anything back.	Payqa manan imatapas hark’ayta munarqanchu.
He couldn’t wait.	Mana suyayta atirqachu.
I will never do this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
Say it’s okay.	Allinmi kasqanmanta niy.
It will never happen in the future.	Hamuq tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
He is proud to be black.	Payqa yana kasqanmantan orgulloso kashan.
But what is good.	Ichaqa imataq allin.
Yeah, that’s like you.	Arí, chayqa qan hinan.
I am the next step.	Ñuqam qatiqnin ruwayqa kani.
But it certainly looks like it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayman rikch’akun.
He always wants her with him.	Payqa sapa kutim munan paywan.
Okay, he didn't have to.	Allinmi, payqa manam chaytaqa ruwananchu karqa.
You can’t get away with it.	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
Black people are really black people.	Yana runakunaqa chiqap yana runakunam.
If so, he knows everything about it.	Chayna kaptinqa tukuy imatam yachan chaymanta.
Not for anything or anywhere.	Mana imapaqpas nitaq maypipas.
Why no one knows.	Imaraykutaq mana pipas yachanchu.
I can't figure out the problem.	Manam atinichu chay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta.
It won’t be a good one.	Mana allinchu kanqa.
He knows that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachan.
He does great success there.	Chaypin hatun allinta ruwan.
But I’m not sure it’s right.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani allin kasqanmanta.
He's out there alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chay hawapi kachkan.
He immediately started making money.	Chayllam qullqita tariyta qallaykurqa.
Nobody really wants to say.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa niyta munanchu.
He just seemed like he was going to help.	Payqa yanapananpaq hinallam rikchakurqa.
I don’t have much to tell you.	Manam anchatachu willanaypaq kanki.
I don’t know about that.	Chaytaqa manam yachanichu.
I would never do that now.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chayna facilchu.
One black, ugly.	Huknin yana, millay.
But of course, if that’s what you want.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, sichus chay munasqayki kanman chayqa.
Something like that.	Imapas chayna kaq.
It probably happens all the time.	Yaqapaschá sapa kutilla chayna kanman.
He really doesn’t care.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana imananpaschu.
He is really very talented.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha yachaysapa.
But he won’t be happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu kanqa.
I wish you wouldn't.	Munaymanmi mana chayta ruwanaykita.
That backfired terribly.	Chayqa sinchitan mana allintachu ruwarqan.
That was a good time to go.	Chayqa allinmi karqan ripunanpaq.
I want to play this game.	Kay pukllayta pukllayta munani.
She is handsome, athletic, and smart.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq, pukllaq, yachaysapa ima.
It didn't look like anything familiar.	Manam imapas riqsisqa hinachu rikchakurqa.
Unfortunately, they weren’t edible.	Llakikuypaqmi, paykunaqa mana mikhuy hinachu karqanku.
She was beautiful, yes.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, arí.
I just didn’t know he was serious.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu serio kasqanmanta.
Let’s wait and see what happens there.	Suyasun chaypi imakuna pasananta.
He had never been like that before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa chay hinachu karqan.
So now you know this.	Chaymi kunan kayta yachanki.
But and you always know.	Ichaqa hinaspa sapa kuti yachanki.
I'm doing it all the time.	Sapa kutim ruwachkani.
Hopefully this will be the case this year.	Munaymanmi kay wata chayna kananta.
He knew full well there was nothing he could do.	Payqa allintan yacharqan mana ima ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Have no idea who he is.	Mana yuyayniyuq kaychu pi kasqanmanta.
I saw that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi rikurqani.
It’s nice of him.	Sumaqmi paymanta.
Like, really bad, so this was a tough one.	Imayna, chiqap mana allin, chaymi kayqa huk sinchi karqa.
Was very disappointed in the outcome.	Ancha hukmanyasqa karqan chay tukukuypi.
It’s not that difficult.	Mana chayna sasachu.
He tried to be positive about it.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi chaymanta allinta rimananpaq.
Unknown treasure.	Mana riqsisqa qhapaq kay.
I could never have done it that long.	Manam haykapipas chayna unayta ruwaymanchu karqa.
Instead, do it now.	Aswanpas kunan ruway.
I suspect he didn’t.	Sospechani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wanted to go to school and become a teacher.	Yachay wasiman riyta, yachachiq kayta ima munarqani.
I never want to see it.	Manam haykapipas qawayta munanichu.
I didn’t see those things.	Chaykunataqa manam rikurqanichu.
It was a performance.	Ruwaymi karqan.
That’s the thing.	Chay kaqmi.
Unfortunately, it was a bad one.	Llakikuypaqmi, mana allin kaqmi karqa.
We can’t find it.	Manam tariyta atichwanchu.
He did it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwarqa.
I make the time.	Tiempotan ruwani.
Now, man.	Kunanqa, runa.
I want to get out of there as soon as possible.	Aswan utqaylla chaymanta lluqsiyta munani.
Describe everything.	Tukuy imamanta willay.
It's the best it's ever looked at.	Aswan allinmi hayk'aqpas qhawarisqa.
So he couldn’t sleep.	Chaymi mana puñuyta atirqachu.
That's always a good thing.	Chayqa sapa kutim allin kaq.
Where did everything go wrong? 	¿Maypitaq tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa?
The whole process can be very quick.	Tukuy ruwayqa ancha utqaylla kanman.
They agree perfectly.	Paykunaqa allintam acuerdopi kanku.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta.
There are several important steps you need to take.	Kanmi achka importante ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq.
He does this all the time.	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon ruwan.
Yeah, maybe you can just do it.	Arí, ichapas chaylla ruwawaq.
Then an hour.	Chaymanta huk hora.
Everything can go wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintam ruwanman.
He probably didn't know exactly what to do.	Payqa manapaschá allintachu yacharqan ima ruwananta.
I can barely sleep.	Yaqapaschá mana puñuyta atinichu.
It had to be there.	Chaypi kanan karqa.
It was easy than that.	Chayna kasqanmantaqa facilmi karqa.
Being human is beautiful.	Runa kayqa sumaqmi.
But that would be better.	Ichaqa chay ruwasqanqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He went swimming again and again.	Payqa yapamanta yapamanta nadaq rirqa.
I haven’t found the way yet.	Manaraqmi ñanta tarinichu.
Now go to the restaurant.	Kunanqa chay mikhuy wasiman riy.
I would never, ever do that to anyone.	Manam haykapipas, mana haykapipas pitapas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
He’s such a player.	Payqa chayna pukllaqmi.
I was beautiful.	Sumaqmi karqani.
Can you stop it? 	¿Atiwaqchu hark’ayta?
I was drunk last night.	Qayna tutam machasqa karqani.
I mean, seriously, awesome.	Niyta munani, serio, manchay.
Hungry and scared.	Yarqasqa mancharisqa.
That it’s ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta.
No, he’s fine.	Manan, payqa allinmi kashan.
If you don’t want it right, that’s fine.	Sichus mana allintachu munanki chayqa, allinmi.
This is the third time.	Kaymi kimsa kaq kuti.
Wasn’t that the case? 	¿Manachu chayna karqa?
And now they were together.	Hinaspa kunanqa kuska karqanku.
I mean, maybe.	Niyta munani, ichapas.
This was a regular practice.	Kayqa sapa kuti ruwaymi karqa.
He could never do it.	Manam haykapipas ruwayta atirqachu.
He probably needs it, but he never thinks about it.	Yaqapaschá necesitan, ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypiqa yuyaykunchu.
And this was pretty big.	Hinaspa kayqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
This guy is a good baseball player.	Kay runaqa allin béisbol pukllaqmi.
Learn what he wants.	Munasqanmanta yachay.
Faster than him.	Paymanta aswan utqaylla.
This is all great.	Kayqa tukuy hatunmi.
I mean, it just can’t be.	Niyta munani, mana chayllachu kanman.
I know it’s here, somewhere.	Yachanin kaypi kashasqanmanta, maypipas.
He said he didn’t want to see her again tonight.	Payqa kunan tuta manaña rikuyta munanichu nispas nisqa.
It was always just that.	Sapa kutim chaylla karqa.
Very much like you.	Anchata qam hina.
He can’t eat it all.	Mana tukuyta mikhuyta atinchu.
But he wouldn’t do it tonight.	Ichaqa manan kunan tutaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
I think you don’t know.	Yuyaykuni mana yachasqaykita.
He was as good as ever.	Payqa ñawpaq hina allinmi karqan.
He says he doesn’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas yachanchu chaymanta nin.
No more coffee.	Manaña kukata.
I want to know how it is.	Imayna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
What actually happened, was this.	Imachus chiqamanta karqa, kay karqa.
I really hope he doesn’t come back.	Chiqamanta suyachkani mana kutimunanta.
That’s probably .	Chayqa yaqapaschá .
But he says it right.	Ichaqa allintan nin.
It wasn’t always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu karqa.
No one is happy with that.	Chaywanqa manam pipas kusisqachu kachkan.
That’s crazy fast.	Chayqa loco utqaylla.
I can’t help but do it.	Manam mana ruwaymanchu.
It was beautiful, really beautiful.	Sumaqmi karqa, chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
He was worried about his failure.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan mana allin ruwasqanmanta.
He made a speech.	Huk rimayta ruwarqa.
But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
Something can be absurd.	Imapas mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Nothing about this is good, at all.	Kaymantaqa manam imapas allinchu, ni imapipas.
Nobody, nobody, nobody.	Mana pipas, mana pipas, ni pipas.
But you know something.	Ichaqa qanmi imatapas yachanki.
He says he won’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwasaqchu nispas nin.
If there is a successor.	Sichus kan huk qatiqnin.
The whole process is quick and easy.	Tukuy ruwayqa utqaylla, mana sasachu.
I hope things work out for you.	Suyachkani imapas allin kananta qampaq.
He sure is terrified.	Seguro mancharisqa kashan.
But it’s always the case.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi.
Don’t do anything too hard.	Mana imatapas llumpay sinchita ruway.
I don’t want to be long.	Manam unaytachu munani.
He could say thank you.	Payqa gracias niyta atinman karqan.
It can be as black as black.	Yana hina yana kanman.
That morning he did.	Chay paqarinmi chayta ruwarqa.
The process, however, was not very successful.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa mana ancha allinchu karqan.
Please, that’s all.	Ama hina kaspa, chaylla.
He can’t say this, he can’t be this crazy.	Payqa manan kayta niyta atinmanchu, manan kay loco kayta atinmanchu.
Okay but not happy.	Allinmi ichaqa mana kusisqachu.
I don't remember why.	Manañam yuyarinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Being funny enough.	Asikunapaq hina kaspa.
And so on every day.	Hinaspa chayna sapa punchaw.
I couldn’t go anywhere, I couldn’t do anything.	Manam maymanpas riyta atirqanichu, imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
Make it something you can do.	Imapas ruwanaykipaq hina ruway.
Beauty is beautiful.	Sumaq kayqa sumaqmi.
He will always be there.	Payqa sapa kutim kanqa.
I know it still exists.	Yachanim kunankamapas kasqanmanta.
He said it was no big deal.	Paymi nirqa chay ruwayqa mana hatun ruwaychu kasqanmanta.
John where.	Juan maypi.
Or a bad weather.	Utaq mana allin pacha.
He said he didn't.	Nirqanmi mana nispa.
It could be the worst thing you can do.	Aswan mana allin ruwaymi kanman.
Then he began to speak.	Chaymantam rimayta qallaykurqa.
I don’t want to be serious.	Manam munanichu serio kayta.
Like the first time.	Ñawpaq kutipi hina.
That looked good on him.	Chayqa allintan qhawarirqan.
It’s really quite funny.	Chiqaptam ancha asikunapaq.
It would be better, anyway.	Aswan allinmi kanman, imayna kaptinpas.
I’m glad, you know.	Kusikuni, yachanki.
They’re good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kanku.
I won’t be able to drive.	Manam carrota manejayta atisaqchu.
But he knows, really.	Ichaqa yachanmi, cheqaqtapuni.
But they are not there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu kashanku.
It was very childlike.	Ancha wawa hinam karqa.
He was not a strong man.	Payqa manam sinchi runachu karqa.
She was excited and wanted to share it with me.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan, chaymi ñoqawan willayta munarqan.
Maybe it’s safe here.	Ichapas kaypi seguro kanman.
That’s what he would have done.	Chaytan ruwanman karqan.
Please tell me more.	Ama hina kaspa, astawan willaway.
These people are insecure.	Kay runakunaqa mana segurochu kanku.
I’m, you know.	Ñuqaqa, yachanki.
Here is what the truth is.	Kaypim kachkan ima chiqap kasqanmanta.
And he stayed there.	Hinaspa chaypi qhepakurqan.
If so, please let me know.	Sichus kan chayqa, ama hina kaspa willaway.
There are a lot of good people there.	Chaypiqa achka allin runakunam kachkan.
However, he is right.	Ichaqa, payqa allintam riman.
I’m thinking about it.	Ñuqaqa yuyani.
Eat a delicious meal.	Sumaq mikhunata mikhuy.
He could not understand why he had been arrested.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imarayku hap’isqa kasqanmanta.
There is no doubt about it.	Mana iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
That’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinpaq.
It was an easier time.	Chayqa aswan facil tiempon karqan.
I want to be that good.	Chayna allin kaytam munani.
He seemed to be speaking.	Payqa rimaq hinam kachkarqa.
But then he didn't want to understand why.	Ichaqa manan chaymantaqa entiendeyta munarqanchu imarayku chayta.
He would be very good at it.	Payqa ancha allinmi kanman chaypi.
That does it, actually.	Chayqa ruwan, chiqaptaqa.
But it was the latter.	Ichaqa qhepa kaqmi karqan.
He can be happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kayta atinman.
And he was happy with that.	Hinaspa chaywan kusisqa kasharqan.
He died two weeks later.	Iskay semana qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I saw that play.	Chay pukllayta rikurqani.
So that’s it.	Chaymi chaylla.
There is a man.	Huk runam kachkan.
They’re not.	Paykunaqa manan.
That was really hard.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa karqan.
If you do, you will always be happy.	Chayta ruwaspaqa sapa kutim kusisqa kanki.
Some of these though.	Wakin chayna kaptinpas.
Actually no, that's not right.	Chiqaptaqa manam, chayqa manam allinchu.
I couldn't ignore it anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanichu.
It’s very nice to me.	Ancha sumaqmi ñuqapaq.
I really think this is for the better.	Chiqaptam piensani kayqa allinpaq kasqanmanta.
I know who those people are.	Yachanim pikuna chay runakuna kasqankuta.
I know it’s sort of.	Yachanim huk laya.
But he didn’t really want to.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu munarqan.
It doesn’t have to be one way or the other.	Manan huk hinachu nitaq huk hinachu kanan.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa llumpay allin runam karqa.
But now, here you are.	Ichaqa kunan, kaypi kanki.
I didn’t really know what to do.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imata ruwanaypaq.
But many people.	Ichaqa achka runakuna.
Anyway, that's what happened.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymi pasarqa.
The night was very cold.	Tutaqa sinchi chiri kasqa.
He had just been overwhelmed.	Payqa chayllaraqmi llumpay llakisqa karqa.
Here’s the first one .	Kaypi ñawpaq kaq .
And tell me.	Hinaspa willaway.
But, of course, that’s not all.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin mana chayllachu.
Strong performance.	Sinchi ruway.
But that was too easy.	Ichaqa chayqa llumpay facilmi karqa.
Say you want to learn something new.	Musuq yachayta munasqaykita niy.
It won’t be too bad.	Manam ancha mana allinchu kanqa.
There he was, himself.	Chaypim payqa karqa, kikin.
For all the good he has done.	Tukuy allin ruwasqanmanta.
I know how you are.	Yachanim imayna kasqaykita.
I still know what it was like.	Kunankamapas yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
Nothing or nowhere was right.	Manam imapas nitaq maypipas allinchu karqa.
And twice before then.	Hinaspa iskay kutita manaraq chaymanta.
I was really upset tonight.	Kunan tutaqa anchatam llakisqa karqani.
I would like to talk.	Munaymanmi rimayta.
he says, he says.	nispas nin, nispa.
But he didn’t say it.	Ichaqa manan nirqanchu.
More like him.	Aswan pay hina.
I can’t find a good solution.	Manam allin allichayta tarinichu.
I never wanted it for anything.	Manam haykapipas imapaqpas munarqanichu.
He’s never a real person.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaq runachu.
That day will be another day.	Chay punchawmi kanqa huk punchawmi kanqa.
So this makes sense.	Chaymi kayqa allin yuyayniyuq.
I did this in a funny way.	Kaytaqa ruwarqani asikunapaq hinam.
They were black.	Paykunaqa yana karqanku.
He made things happen.	Paymi imakunatapas ruwarqa.
I'm looking for all of that.	Tukuy chayta maskachkani.
It looks like yours.	Qampa hinam rikchakun.
They weren’t sure he was coming.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu karqanku hamunanta.
So you’re going to do it.	Chaymi qamqa ruwanki.
Yes, that’s a week.	Arí, chayqa huk semanan.
That he feels so strongly about this.	Kaymanta ancha sinchita sientekusqanmanta.
He probably knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yaqapaschá ima ruwananta yacharqan.
Two unfortunate things happened.	Iskay llakikuypaqmi pasarqa.
Two people were not good enough.	Iskay runakunaqa manam allinchu karqaku.
Doing a lot of silly things.	Achka mana yuyayniyuq ruwaykunata ruwaspa.
He was literally speechless.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana rimayta atirqanchu.
You want a	Munanki huk .
Not just that, anyway.	Mana chayllachu, imayna kaptinpas.
Not the first time, not the last time.	Mana ñawpaq kutichu, mana qhipa kutichu.
I really wish that wasn't the case.	Chiqaptam munani mana chayna kananta.
If only he were here.	Sichus pay kaypi kanman chayqa.
However, nothing worked.	Ichaqa, manan imapas allinchu karqan.
Out there, somewhere.	Chay hawapi, maypipas.
Nothing less true.	Manan imapas pisi cheqaqchu.
That no longer seems true.	Chayqa manañan cheqaqchu rikch’akun.
They are always tough.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim sinchi sasa kanku.
I am doing it as usual.	Ñuqaqa sapa kuti hinam ruwachkani.
But he will do what he has to do.	Ichaqa imatachus ruwananta ruwanqa.
I am truly sorry.	Cheqaqtapunin llakikuni.
Why is this the case.	¿Imanasqataq kayqa.
She’s a good girl with lots of ideas.	Payqa allin sipasmi, achka yuyayniyuq.
He should have been responsible for the injury.	Chay k’irisqa kasqanmantan huchayoq kanan karqan.
I found it very difficult to say much about anything.	Ancha sasam tarikurqani imamantapas achkata rimayqa.
Maybe a month, maybe longer.	Ichapas huk killa, ichapas aswan unayta.
I know, now, why you say that.	Yachanim, kunan, imanasqa chayta nisqaykita.
He would never do anything about it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas ruwanmanchu.
This happened and that.	Kayqa pasarqa chaymanta chay.
This was not too difficult.	Kayqa manam ancha sasachu karqa.
Nice and uncertain.	Sumaq hinaspa mana seguro.
No one seemed to be hurt.	Manas pipas k’irisqa hinachu karqan.
The more you do something, the easier it will be.	Imatapas astawan ruwaspaqa facilmi kanqa.
But that was not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
And, you know, that would be good.	Hinaspa, yachanki, chayqa allinmi kanman.
That’s not a good thing anymore.	Chayqa manañan allinchu.
Surprisingly, he was fine.	Admirakuypaqmi, payqa allinmi karqa.
I wonder if there will be anything else.	Huk imapas kanqachu icha manachu chayta tapukuni.
I’m here, he’s there.	Ñuqaqa kaypi kachkani, payqa chaypi kachkan.
The villain, of course.	Chay millay runaqa, sut’inmi.
He doesn’t have to be alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kanan.
I heard it all.	Tukuy chayta uyarirqani.
A problem there.	Chaypi huk sasachakuy.
To make more money.	Aswan qullqita ruwanapaq.
I knew it all along.	Tukuy tiempon chaytaqa yacharqani.
But how to do that.	Ichaqa imaynatataq chayta ruwana.
He doesn’t know how that works.	Payqa manan yachanchu imaynatachus chay ruwasqanqa.
He wanted to leave as soon as possible.	Payqa usqhayllan ripuyta munarqan.
Everything is fine with me now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi ñuqapaq kachkan.
Instead,	Aswanpas, .
This is not going to be easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu kanqa.
He was too big.	Payqa llumpay hatunmi karqa.
This is certainly important.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa ancha importante.
It’s a big deal, kid.	Hatun ruwaymi, wawa.
Nothing crazy about it.	Mana imapas chaypiqa loco.
He would do well, he certainly would.	Payqa allintan ruwanman, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
He is probably in trouble.	Payqa yaqapaschá sasachakuypi tarikun.
I am no longer that person.	Manañam chay runachu kani.
Sick of him.	Paymanta unqusqa.
Then be sure of everything.	Chaymanta tukuy imamanta seguro kay.
Rich and young.	Qhapaq hinaspa wayna.
About being young.	Wayna kaymanta.
I would have been there.	Chaypim kayman karqa.
There had to be one.	Hukninmi kanan karqa.
Whoever is anyone.	Pichus pipas.
Something said.	Imapas nisqa.
This was a new process.	Kayqa musuq ruwaymi karqa.
But unfortunately, it's not very good.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi, manam ancha allinchu.
Probably, there is.	Yaqapaschá, kan.
That is really hard.	Chay ruwasqanqa cheqaqtapunin sasa.
He can get out now.	Payqa kunanmi lluqsiyta atin.
Both of those are pretty bad.	Chay iskayninkun allin millay kanku.
He was a crazy man.	Payqa loco runam karqa.
I can hardly do that.	Chaytaqa sinchitan ruwayta atiyman.
They are never sure.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas segurochu kanku.
Beauty though.	Sumaq kay ichaqa.
But he can’t stay.	Ichaqa manan qhepakuyta atinchu.
We will have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwananchik kanqa.
Sure, if you will.	Seguro, sichus munanki chayqa.
Yes he was angry, but crazy no.	Arí payqa phiñasqa, ichaqa loco manan.
But that he couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa mana ruway atisqanmanta.
But that’s never a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu.
And it’s morning again.	Hinaspa yapamanta paqarin.
But not doing it right.	Ichaqa mana allintachu ruwaspa.
I was really excited.	Cheqaqtapunin kusisqa karqani.
No one could, including him.	Manan pipas atirqanchu, paywan kuska.
This would be the last, at least.	Kayqa qhipa kaq kanman, aswanpas.
I just learned something about myself.	Chayllaraqmi ñoqamanta imatapas yacharqani.
There he was, as always.	Chaypim payqa karqa, sapa kuti hina.
It doesn't matter,	Manam imananpaschu, .
We partied hard.	Sinchitan fiestata ruwaq kayku.
He said he didn't know.	Paymi nirqa mana yachasqayta.
It's there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kachkan.
How will it come today.	Kunan punchaw imaynataq hamunqa.
It started to look interesting.	Chayqa sumaq rikchayniyuq kaytam qallaykurqa.
I have my doubts here.	Kaypiqa iskayrayani.
Not so good this month though.	Mana ancha allinchu kay killapi ichaqa.
No, he’s never alone.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu.
I wouldn’t have needed it.	Manam necesitasaqchu karqa.
A lot of bad things.	Achka mana allin.
No, they certainly are.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin kanku.
It’s actually worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi.
I wonder when that will happen.	Tapukuni haykapi chay kanqa nispa.
Not a rich man.	Mana qhapaq runachu.
But that was me.	Ichaqa chaymi ñoqa karqani.
He is very tired.	Payqa sinchitan sayk’usqa kashan.
Even if it never happened.	Mana haykapipas chayna kaptinpas.
He was there most of the night.	Payqa yaqa llapan tutam chaypi karqa.
He talks about you all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon qanmanta riman.
In fact, the lower the better.	Aswanpas aswan pisi kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
I had to do it now.	Kunanmi ruwanay karqa.
I will be for sure!.	¡Cheqaqtapunin kasaq!.
It was very hard you know.	Ancha sasa karqan yachanki.
He can’t sleep there.	Manam chaypiqa puñuyta atinchu.
I never, ever thought this would happen.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas piensarqanichu kayna kananta.
A lot of pipes, actually.	Achka pipas, chiqaptaqa.
He was alone, as always.	Payqa sapallanmi karqan, sapa kuti hina.
He was alone at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sapallanmi kasqa.
She wants everything for him.	Payqa tukuy imatam munan paypaq.
No, it’s not worth it.	Manan, manan valenchu.
Something else than madness.	Huk imapas loco kaymantaqa.
There were some nice people there.	Chaypi wakin sumaq runakuna kasqa.
That’s what you think.	Chaytan yuyaykunki.
Someone to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwananpaq.
I want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munani.
But he was alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi karqan.
It was actually fine.	Chiqaptaqa allintam karqa.
He was obviously impressed.	Sut’inmi payqa admirasqa kasharqan.
I was really hurt.	Chiqamanta k’irisqa karqani.
So, that’s it, that’s it.	Chaymi, chayna, chayna.
If you’re big, you’re big.	Hatun kanki chayqa, hatunmi kanki.
So we did it for a while.	Chaymi huk tiempo ruwarqayku.
He loves to linger.	Payqa anchatan munan unayta qhepakuyta.
I really, really want to.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta munani.
No one could help him.	Manan pipas yanapayta atirqanchu.
And be angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kay.
He walked around the city all night.	Tukuy tutan llaqtata puriq.
He tells her to go.	Payqa riy nispas nin.
He was barely human.	Payqa yaqapaschá runa hina kasqa.
Where it would have been.	Maypichus kanman karqan.
Go there this weekend.	Kay semana tukukuypi chayman riy.
And, of course, they’re anything but.	Hinaspa, sut’inmi, paykunaqa imapas ichaqa.
He didn’t say much.	Payqa manan anchatachu nisqa.
One, then two, then three.	Huk, chaymanta iskay, chaymanta kimsa.
What is the right thing to do? 	¿Imatan ruwanan?
Three and you failed.	Kimsa hinaspa mana allintachu ruwarqanki.
He agreed to do so.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi arí nisqa.
Of course, not everything is good.	Arí, manam tukuy imapas allinchu.
It really is that quick.	Chiqaptam chayna utqaylla.
It was as cold as ice.	Chayqa chiri hina chiri karqa.
He was never without it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas mana chaywanqa karqanchu.
He had to do something.	Imapas ruwanan karqa.
He was out there.	Payqa chay hawapi kasqa.
There was one this morning.	Kunan paqarin huk karqan.
That all seems a long time ago now.	Chay tukuy imapas kunanqa unayñam rikchakun.
He doesn’t think he’s bigger than that.	Payqa manan chaymanta aswan hatun kananpaqmi yuyaykun.
So much goodness.	Chayna achka allin kay.
He died a year later.	Payqa huk wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I really wanted it to be a secret.	Anchatam munarqani pakasqa kananta.
About what it really means.	Imachus cheqaqtapuni niyta munan chaymanta.
Afterwards he said he was tired.	Chay qhepamanmi nirqan sayk’usqa kasqayta.
If not next year, then the year.	Mana hamuq wata kaptinqa, chaymanta wata.
More and more people want to know about it.	Aswan achka runakunam chaymanta yachayta munanku.
They are like that.	Paykunaqa hinam kanku.
So that’s not a good thing.	Chaymi chay nisqanqa mana allinchu.
Here's how you do it.	Kaypi imaynatam ruwanki.
I never really noticed it before.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa repararqanichu ñawpaqtaqa.
Maybe I have a problem.	Ichapas huk sasachakuypi tarikuni.
But, of course, everything went wrong.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi, tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqan.
Now he knew where he was.	Kunanqa maypi kasqanmantam yacharqa.
You mean yes to it.	Arí niyta munanki.
Everyone is confused.	Lliwmi pantasqa kachkanku.
It’s not good, it’s not bad.	Mana allinchu, mana mana allinchu.
Will he do anything?.	¿Imatapas ruwanqachu?.
A very good one, at least for now.	Huk ancha allin kaq, kunankamapas.
He really wants to do things right.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munan imatapas allinta ruwayta.
It wouldn’t be true.	Mana cheqaqchu kanman.
I mean the immediate game.	Chaylla pukllayta niyta munani.
It’s not always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu.
Tell me when you are ready.	Willaway haykapi listoña kasqaykita.
It went well, alright.	Allintam rirqa, allinmi.
I’m not this guy.	Manam kay runachu kani.
So, it’s very important.	Chaymi, ancha importante.
He doesn't have to do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwananchu.
Not yet .	Manaraq .
I’m not good again.	Hukmanta mana allinchu kani.
This happened every single day, always.	Kayqa sapa sapa punchawmi karqa, sapa kutim.
According to the action.	Ruwayman hina.
One of them has to do it.	Hukninmi ruwanan.
I feel good about this too.	Ñuqapas kaymantaqa allintam sientekuni.
And that’s what’s good for you.	Hinaspa chaymi qampaq allinqa.
What will happen will happen.	Imataq kanqa kanqa.
He couldn't stand it.	Payqa manam aguantayta atirqachu.
And you’re stupid.	Hinaspa sonso kanki.
He realized he was hurt.	Payqa repararqanmi k’irisqa kashasqanmanta.
I am so excited to give it a go.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani huk kutita ruwanaypaq.
No one can say it.	Mana pi niyta atinchu.
This doesn’t mean you can’t be rich and successful.	Kayqa manan niyta munanchu mana qhapaq kayta atisqaykita, allin ruwaq kayta atisqaykita.
Sure, you know you’re a good teacher.	Seguro, yachanki allin yachachiq kasqaykita.
He went to school a lot.	Payqa achkatam yachay wasiman rirqa.
I am now a married man.	Kunanqa casarasqa runam kani.
Even in the worst case scenario.	Aswan mana allin kaptinpas.
That played no part.	Chayqa manan ima ruwaytapas ruwarqanchu.
He was a child again.	Payqa yapamanta wawa kasqa.
You didn’t seem nervous, she said.	Manas mancharisqa hinachu karqanki, nispas nin.
Later he said maybe he knows.	Qhepamanmi nirqan ichapas yachan nispa.
It was a very sad experience.	Chayqa llumpay llakikuypaqmi karqa.
It truly is everywhere.	Cheqaqtapunin maypipas kashan.
Be good to him.	Paywan allin kay.
Otherwise it was a really, really nice day.	Mana chayqa chiqap, chiqap sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I am so excited for that.	Chaypaqqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani.
It’s great for him.	Paypaq hatunmi.
Everything in it.	Tukuy ima chaypi kaq.
He wanted to go, awesome.	Payqa riyta munarqa, manchay.
He knows where he’s going.	Payqa yachanmi mayman risqanmanta.
But now maybe he won’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa ichapas mana ruwanqachu.
Or as a big one.	Utaq hatun hina.
He’s been arrested.	Payqa hap’isqa kashan.
Maybe more than he needs.	Ichapas necesitasqanmanta aswan achkata.
You, you don't	Qamqa, manam .
That’s a good thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa allinmi.
I still want to know the answer.	Kunankamapas chay kutichiyta yachayta munani.
This process is easy and quick.	Kay ruwayqa mana sasachu, utqaylla ima.
No one ever did, unless they knew the story.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu, manachus chay willakuyta yacharqan chayqa.
I would love to learn to sound like this.	Anchatan munani kay hinata uyariyta yachayta.
Then it’s kind of.	Chaymantaqa huk laya.
Never not what the future holds.	Mana hayk’aqpas mana imachus hamuq tiempo kanqa chayta.
We should have done it last year.	Qayna wata ruwananchik karqa.
This is a fairly difficult task.	Kayqa allin sasa ruwaymi.
You have a wonderful idea.	Qamqa huk sumaq yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I really want that to happen.	Chiqaptam munani chayna kananta.
This is where I disagree.	Kaypim mana acuerdopichu kachkani.
They are all human beings.	Llapallankum runa kanku.
He talks about her all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim paymanta riman.
But never do it.	Ichaqa ama hayk’aqpas ruwaychu.
He still can't sleep.	Hinallam mana puñuyta atinchu.
So, this is very important.	Chaymi, kayqa ancha importante.
I can’t remember anymore.	Manañam yuyariyta atinichu.
He was much bigger than he is now.	Payqa kunan kasqanmantaqa aswan hatunmi karqa.
Not happy with it.	Mana kusisqachu.
I know, it makes no sense.	Yachanim, manam imapaqpas valenchu.
It must be a mistake.	Pantasqa kanan tiyan.
This is very important if you want to understand language.	Chayqa ancha allinmi simita entiendeyta munaspaqa.
Things may not be right.	Manapaschá imapas allinchu kanman.
Unfortunately, this is not always true.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa manam sapa kutichu chiqap.
And thanks for last night.	Hinaspa qayna tutamanta gracias.
Things are as usual here.	Kaypiqa imapas sapa kuti hinam kachkan.
He couldn’t understand that.	Chaytan mana entiendeyta atirqanchu.
And people know things.	Hinaspa runakunaqa yachanku imakunatapas.
But of course this is not the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana chay hinachu.
ME? 	ÑUQA?
I know there is nothing there.	Yachanim chaypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
There has to be something else to do.	Huk ruwaymi kanan.
I want to see him come here.	Kayman hamunanta rikuyta munani.
She knew the truth about him.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta cheqaq kaqta.
He wouldn’t have wanted to.	Payqa manan munanmanchu karqan.
This is something that needs to be done.	Kaytaqa ruwana tiyan.
I’m really confused about what should happen.	Chiqamanta pantasqa kachkani chaymanta imachus kanan tiyan.
However, he is right.	Ichaqa, allintam nin.
Don’t be those people.	Ama chay runakunaqa kaychu.
He seemed to fit the bill.	Payqa chayman hinam rikchakurqa.
He’s planning to do it now.	Kunan ruwayta yuyaykushan.
These things cannot be left out.	Chaykunataqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
Without it, this could be pretty disastrous.	Mana chaywanqa kayqa allintam mana allintachu ruwanman.
So he said it was good.	Chaymi allin kasqanmanta nirqa.
If anyone could do the job, it was him.	Sichus pipas chay llank’ayta ruwayta atinman chayqa, paymi karqan.
But no, it’s great.	Ichaqa manan, hatunmi.
He is the best of the best.	Payqa aswan allin kaqmi.
Eventually, but not yet.	Qhepamanmi, ichaqa manaraqmi.
You just did it again.	Chayllaraqmi hukmanta ruwarqanki.
Or a year.	Utaq huk wata.
I wonder how that happened.	Tapukuni imaynataq chay pasasqanmanta.
I had never seen that before.	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
It was just, more than hungry.	Chaylla, yarqaymanta aswan karqa.
I wonder what that is.	Tapukuni imataq chay kasqanmanta.
But only you know that.	Ichaqa qamllam chaytaqa yachanki.
Sure it is now.	Seguro kunanmi kachkan.
I don't understand these things.	Chaykunataqa manam entiendenichu.
And now is a good time.	Hinaspa kunanqa allin tiempo.
I don't think it's that funny.	Manam chayna asikunapaq hinachu hapini.
He probably has a reason for it.	Payqa yaqapaschá imaraykupas chayta ruwananpaq.
Not good, but effective.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa allin ruwaq.
He was lonely and almost depressed.	Payqa sapallanmi kasharqan, yaqapaschá llakisqa kasharqan.
I thought that would be great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
However, that is neither here nor there.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
I’m not here anymore.	Manañam kaypichu kachkani.
They are really very good.	Chiqaptam ancha allin kanku.
I made them this morning.	Chaykunataqa kunan paqarinmi ruwarqani.
They really know everything.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin tukuy imatapas yachanku.
It’s going to be pretty good.	Allin allinmi kanqa.
This is kind of a big deal.	Kayqa huk laya hatun ruwaymi.
He is very short-sighted.	Payqa ancha pisi yuyayniyuqmi.
In a way, that was amazing.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
You just did it on time.	Chayllaraqmi tiempollanpi ruwarqanki.
There really is no time.	Chiqaptaqa manam tiempo kanchu.
He should be here by now.	Payqa kunankamaqa kaypim kanan.
But thankfully, tonight he was.	Ichaqa gracias, kunan tutaqa paymi karqan.
Now something is wrong.	Kunanqa imapas mana allinmi.
He does everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwan.
They are mine.	Paykunaqa ñuqapa kaqmi.
It has been about two years now.	Kunanqa yaqa iskay watañam.
What a crazy day.	Ima loco punchawmi.
Sure would do well.	Seguro allinta ruwanman.
He’s a lot like you.	Payqa anchatan qan hina.
To be happy.	Kusisqa kananpaq.
That’s right there.	Chayqa chaypi allinmi.
Which requires some action at the moment.	Imataq kunan pacha wakin ruwayta munan.
But I don’t see it.	Ichaqa manan rikunichu.
I don't remember his name anymore.	Manañam sutinta yuyarinichu.
He never needed it.	Mana hayk’aqpas necesitarqanchu.
Must agree with him there.	Chaypi paywan acuerdopi kanan tiyan.
And he's right about that.	Hinaspa payqa chaymantaqa allintam rimachkan.
But he had to do something right.	Ichaqa allintan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I probably won’t have time.	Manachá tiempoy kanqachu.
That you’re not alone.	Mana sapallayki kasqaykita.
I didn’t know what to do about it.	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
I feel sorry for him, really.	Paymanta llakikuni, chiqamanta.
That means something is wrong.	Chayqa niyta munan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
That’s a good thing.	Chay nisqanqa allinmi.
There is no villain.	Manam millay runa kanchu.
I want to do big things, really big things.	Hatun ruwaykunata ruwayta munani, chiqap hatun ruwaykunata.
Probably the easiest way to do it.	Yaqapaschá aswan facil ruwayqa kanman.
The first is time.	Ñawpaq kaqmi tiempo.
That sounds much better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi uyarikun.
That’s obviously not the case here.	Chayqa sut’inmi kaypi mana chay hinachu.
I felt lonely.	Sapallanmi tarikurqani.
It was a beauty.	Sumaq kaymi karqa.
I don’t know what to say about this.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta ima niyta.
You wouldn’t want that.	Manam munawaqchu chaytaqa.
Some people really are.	Wakin runakunaqa cheqaqtapunin chhayna kanku.
Never saw him before this afternoon.	Mana hayk’aqpas kunan tarde ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
I know how hard it is here.	Yachanim kaypi imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
Repeat these steps.	Kay ruwaykunata yapamanta ruway.
Why would he do that?	¿Imaraykutaq chayta ruwanman.
I would love to be one.	Anchatan munani huknin kayta.
Almost a stranger.	Yaqa mana riqsisqa runa.
If not this year, then the next.	Mana kay wata kaptinqa, chaymanta hamuq.
That’s pretty amazing.	Chayqa allin admirakuypaqmi.
Now I am in hiding.	Kunanqa pakasqa kachkani.
He wants to tell you something.	Imatapas willayta munan.
You’re the one.	Qamqa kaymi kanki.
There is a man of good sense there.	Chaypiqa kanmi allin yuyayniyuq runa.
Strong, vicious man.	Sinchi, millay runa.
Not yet.	Mana manaraq.
You are, sometimes.	Qamqa kanki, wakin kuti.
You still don't know why there are so many people.	Hinallam mana yachankichu imanasqa achka runakuna kasqanmanta.
Of this, if nothing else, he was certain.	Kaymantaqa, mana imapas kaptinqa, payqa segurom karqa.
But don't do this.	Ama ichaqa kayta ruwaychu.
I’ve seen it all along.	Tukuy tiempon chaytaqa rikurqani.
It was good for him to be alone.	Pay sapallan kaptinqa allinmi karqa.
Black people are human beings.	Yana runakunaqa runam.
He found himself.	Payqa tarikurqa.
He knows your thoughts.	Payqa yachanmi yuyaykusqaykita.
So, you think about this horrible future.	Chaymi, kay manchay hamuq tiempopi yuyaykunki.
Something is terribly wrong.	Imapas manchay mana allinchu.
Every night was a chance.	Sapa tutam huk chansa karqa.
Be the first!.	¡Ñawpaq kaq kay!.
There is no set.	Manam kanchu churasqa.
That was probably the best thing ever.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allin karqan.
So he said, 'It's.	Chaymi payqa nisqa.
You go first this time.	Qamqa kay kutipi puntata rinki.
I'm not sure anymore either.	Ñuqapas manañam segurochu kani.
I’d love to be there with you.	Chaypi qanwan kuska kayta anchata munani.
But that is not true.	Ichaqa manan chayqa cheqaqchu.
I feel a lot too.	Ñuqapas anchatam sientekuni.
He is afraid to go outside.	Payqa manchakunmi hawaman lluqsiyta.
That was totally fine.	Chayqa llapanpim allin karqa.
You want it like you do now.	Kunan hinam munanki.
And after that.	Hinaspa chay qhepaman.
I really couldn’t figure it out.	Chiqaptaqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
But that doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He had been out for a long time.	Payqa unayñan hawapi kasharqan.
But the process was not difficult.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan sasachu karqan.
He seems happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam kachkan.
You know, like before.	Yachanki, ñawpaq hina.
No one seemed seriously hurt.	Manan pipas sinchita k’irisqa hinachu karqan.
All right, all right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi, allinmi.
He was happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kasharqan.
But maybe he will.	Ichaqa ichapas chayta ruwanqa.
It didn't matter if he was ready or not.	Manam imananpaschu karqa listoña kaptinpas mana kaptinpas.
I think that's what it says.	Chayqa chaytam nin nispaymi piensani.
He could have done it very hard.	Payqa ancha sinchitan ruwayta atinman karqan.
Here it is for you always.	Kaypi kachkan qampaq sapa kuti.
So I wanted to know.	Chayraykum yachayta munarqani.
Some other people are.	Wakin huk runakunam.
But it’s hard, to be here.	Ichaqa sasam, kaypi kayqa.
But really, no.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin, manan.
One is fast, or rather, not that.	Hukninmi utqaylla, utaq aswan allinta, mana chay.
I’m the last one.	Qhepa kaqmi kani.
They’re obviously tired.	Sut’inmi sayk’usqa kasqankuta.
I don’t know why anyone would do that.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa pipas chayta ruwanmanchu.
He allowed her to do so.	Chaynata ruwananpaqmi saqirqa.
I’m fine with that, he said.	Chaywanqa allinmi kani nispa.
I want to do it tonight.	Kunan tuta ruwayta munani.
He said he was too happy to say.	Paymi nirqa llumpay kusisqa kasqanmanta rimananpaq.
Why did he do this.	Imaraykutaq kayta ruwarqa.
If you have to do this, you will.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan chayqa, ruwanki.
He pretends to be sad.	Llakisqa hinam ruwan.
They are wicked people.	Paykunaqa millay runakunam kanku.
Yes, we really did this.	Arí, chiqaptam kayta ruwarqayku.
He is still not happy.	Payqa kunankamapas manam kusisqachu kachkan.
And, indeed, it was.	Hinaspa, cheqaqtapuni, karqan.
Being a child is hard.	Wawa kayqa sasam.
We must act quickly.	Usqhaylla ruwananchik tiyan.
These were wonderful people.	Kaykunaqa sumaq runakunam karqaku.
I could hardly say anything.	Manapaschá imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
Maybe he never could.	Ichapas mana haykapipas atinmanchu karqa.
It’s like a problem child.	Chayqa sasachakuy wawa hinam.
I think it will be good for him.	Yuyaykuni paypaq allin kanqa.
It would be like a child.	Wawa hina kanman.
I don't like this.	Kayqa manam gustawanchu.
It seemed like yesterday, but it had been so long ago.	Qayna punchaw hinam karqa, ichaqa ancha unayñam karqa.
He had always considered himself superior to her.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi paymanta aswan allinpaq qhawarisqa.
He realized what was going on.	Payqa repararqanmi imachus kasqanta.
He used to do that.	Payqa chaytan ruwaq.
Go and do that.	Riy chayta ruway.
It is better to do the right thing.	Aswan allinmi allin kaqta ruway.
Maybe it’s more accurate.	Ichapas aswan chiqap kanman.
Really, really bad.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana allin.
She could tell he was unhappy.	Payqa repararqanmi mana kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
It can be all day long.	Tukuy punchawmi kanman.
That was a girl.	Chayqa sipasmi kasqa.
He wasn't sure he could do that.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruway atisqanmanta.
I’m thinking hard.	Sinchitan yuyaykushani.
It is there in everything.	Tukuy imapipas chaypim kachkan.
It’s pretty big here.	Kaypiqa ancha hatunmi.
He seemed very easily disappointed.	Payqa ancha facilmi hukmanyasqa hina karqa.
I saw the game there.	Chaypi pukllayta rikurqani.
He wants to ask you something.	Payqa imatapas tapuyta munan.
That may not be strictly true, but it doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manapaschá sinchi cheqaqchu kanman, ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Okay, that’s easy.	Allinmi, chayqa facilmi.
I was early as usual.	Sapa kuti hinam temprano karqani.
I don’t want you to be with me.	Manam munanichu ñuqawan kanaykita.
Now, it better be quick.	Kunanqa, aswan allinmi utqaylla.
He said he wanted to see it.	Nirqam qawayta munani nispa.
Obviously I was very wrong.	Sut’inmi ancha pantasqa kasqayta.
What's the deal with that.	Imataq chaywanqa kachkan.
Was he there?.	¿Chaypichu karqa?.
He couldn’t eat it.	Payqa manam mikuyta atirqachu.
Now there are two options.	Kunanqa iskay ruwaymi kachkan.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Allinmi kanman, mana allinmi kanman.
People are tired of it.	Runakunaqa sayk’usqañan kashanku.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwayta atinchu.
This is the last chance to succeed.	Kaymi qhipa kaq chansa allinta ruwanapaq.
Learn all you can.	Tukuy atisqaykita yachay.
I’m all yours.	Lliwmi qampa kani.
If he didn't, he did her.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa, payta ruwarqa.
But he can’t tell you much about that one.	Ichaqa manan chay hukmanta anchata willayta atinchu.
If you want something nice, don’t do it.	Sumaq kaqta munanki chayqa, ama ruwaychu.
You can’t do that again.	Manam chaytaqa yapamanta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You think you can do what you want.	Munasqaykita ruwayta atisqaykita yuyanki.
He said it anyway.	Chaytaqa imayna kaptinpas nirqam.
The second is crazier.	Iskay kaq aswan loco.
Probably more like a month.	Yaqapaschá huk killa hina aswan.
He can no longer grasp what he wants to know.	Manañan yachay munasqanta hap’iyta atinchu.
You can't find a barrier.	Manan hark'ayta tariyta atiwaqchu.
But it was always there.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
I'd rather talk to someone.	Aswan allinmi kanman piwanpas rimayta.
Do the best thing first.	Ñawpaqtaqa aswan allin kaqta ruway.
I know that in many cases it is not.	Yachanim achka kutipi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
They were good enough.	Paykunaqa allinmi karqanku.
I wish it was all the time.	Munaymanmi tukuy tiempo kananta.
Now, here’s another thing.	Kunanqa, kaypi huk kaq.
This guy is angry.	Kay runaqa phiñasqa kachkan.
But that’s the thing.	Ichaqa chaymi chay.
Maybe he was smart about why I did it.	Ichapas payqa yachaysapa karqa imarayku ruwasqaymanta.
I really, really need money.	Ancha, anchatam qullqita necesitasaq.
I don’t know how to play this.	Kayta pukllayta mana yachanichu.
Three days after that.	Kimsa punchaw chaymanta.
And that’s all it will be this evening.	Hinaspa chaylla kanqa kunan ch’isi.
Two black men.	Iskay yana runakuna.
I do it very often.	Ancha sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwani.
So they were there this time.	Chaymi paykunaqa kay kutipi chaypi karqaku.
Every day, in fact.	Sapa punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
I know you are not happy.	Yachanim mana kusisqachu kasqaykita.
Can't really figure it out.	Mana chiqaptachu yuyaymanayta atin.
He died a month later.	Huk killa qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
He was a great villain, after all.	Payqa hatun millay runan karqan, tukuy imamanta.
It was home, sort of.	Wasi karqan, huk laya.
Something like him.	Pay hina imapas.
I have lived here for a long time.	Unayñam kaypi yachani.
They were together day and night.	Paykunaqa tuta punchawmi kuska karqaku.
So, this is a very big deal.	Chaymi, kayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi.
That sounds like a lot.	Chayqa achka hinam uyarikun.
And he looked at her.	Hinan payta qhawarirqan.
He was one of the guys.	Paymi huknin wayna kasqa.
However, he is willing.	Ichaqa, payqa munasqanman hinam.
Whoever it is.	Pi kaptinpas.
It’s all right.	Lliwmi.
There you go.	Chaypim rinki.
This doesn’t work well.	Kayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
He couldn't be black, she said.	Payqa manam yana kayta atirqachu, nispas nin.
So there isn’t.	Chaymi mana kanchu.
I mean they’re really good.	Chiqamanta allin kasqankuta niyta munani.
Now of course, of course.	Kunanqa sut’inmi, sut’inmi.
One night maybe.	Huk tuta ichapas.
He knew everything about her.	Payqa tukuy imatam yacharqa paymanta.
But that night he never did.	Ichaqa chay tutaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He’s the one who does it.	Payqa chaytan ruwan.
He knew everything about her.	Payqa tukuy imatam paymanta yacharqa.
He looked sad again.	Hukmanta llakisqa qhawarisqa.
You can no longer be sure what will happen.	Manañan seguro kayta atiwaqchu imachus pasananta.
Something like that, anyway.	Imapas chayna, imayna kaptinpas.
He looked so funny.	Payqa ancha asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
That approach is not appropriate in this application.	Chay ruwayqa manan allinchu kay ruwaypi.
Be the first to be.	Ñawpaq kaq kay.
So again, thank you.	Chaymi yapamanta, gracias.
This, he opened.	Kayta, kicharirqa.
It must be alone.	Sapallanmi kanan.
Same and same, same and same.	Kikin hinaspa kikin, kikin hinaspa kikin.
You learned one very important thing.	Huk ancha importante kaqmi yacharqanki.
If he knew that.	Sichus chayta yacharqan chayqa.
You are less than nothing.	Mana imamanta pisi kanki.
It was probably too easy.	Yaqapaschá llumpay facil karqa.
This process was successful.	Kay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
I mean, anyone.	Niyta munani, pitapas.
Anything anything I don’t want anymore.	Imapas imatapas manañam munanichu.
They are afraid.	Paykunaqa manchakunmi.
And sad for me.	Hinaspa llakisqa ñuqapaq.
It was just how to do it.	Imaynatachus ruwana chaylla karqa.
He was very angry with her.	Payqa llumpay phiñasqa kasqa paywan.
Do or don’t do it.	Ruway utaq mana ruway.
No one should have any doubts about this.	Kaymantaqa manam pipas iskay yuyayniyuqchu kanan.
By doing everything accordingly.	Tukuy chayman hina ruwaspa.
What is the probability? 	¿Imataq kanman?
Let’s hope that happens.	Suyasun chayna kananpaq.
This process is anything but quick.	Kay ruwayqa imapas ichaqa utqaylla.
Maybe this was the first time.	Ichapas kayqa ñawpaq kuti karqa.
That is, unless you’re me.	Chayqa, manachus ñuqa kanki chayqa.
Everything looks great now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas ancha allinmi rikchakun.
Everything is good for you.	Tukuy imapas allinmi qampaq.
I just couldn’t quit.	Chaylla mana saqiyta atirqanichu.
He wants to tell the good news.	Allin willakuyta willayta munan.
We all had it.	Llapanchismi karqan.
He has done things like this before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kayna ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
Maybe someone bought a house.	Ichapas pipas wasinta rantirqa.
He wasn't like everyone else, she knew.	Payqa manan llapa runakuna hinachu karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
Maybe it wasn’t meant to be.	Ichapas mana chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
Or so he says.	Utaq chaynatam nin.
And if so, how does he do that?.	Hinaspa chayna kaptinqa, ¿imaynatataq chayta ruwan?.
He looked at something though.	Payqa imatapas qhawarisqa ichaqa.
It didn't matter what it was.	Imapas kaptinpas manam imananpaschu karqa.
Maybe there was a bit of truth in that.	Ichapas chaypi huk chikan chiqap kaq karqa.
He knew how to find it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna tariyta.
I really didn't expect that from you.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa suyarqanichu qammanta.
Here is where a young man got into trouble.	Kaypim huk wayna sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I know he was happy.	Yachanim kusisqa kasqanmanta.
No one can see him.	Paytaqa manam pipas qawayta atinchu.
So he doesn’t do anything.	Chaymi payqa mana imatapas ruwanchu.
So, now .	Chaymi, kunanqa .
I don't know how to express myself.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam rimanaypaq.
But no no no.	Ichaqa manan manan mana.
It went faster after that.	Chay qhepamanmi aswan usqhaylla rirqan.
This was supposed to be a good day.	Kayqa allin punchawmi kanan karqa.
But he came alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi hamurqa.
Go home, maybe.	Wasiykiman riy, ichapas.
Now, no one knows.	Kunanqa, manam pipas yachanchu.
But it seems to sit there for a while.	Ichaqa huk rato chaypi tiyaq hina.
You can do better than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan allintam ruwawaq.
Two years have passed.	Iskay watañam pasarqa.
He’s busy but he says yes.	Payqa ocupasqa kashan ichaqa arí nin.
Not bad, but kind of silly.	Mana mana allinchu, ichaqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam.
I was very happy.	Llumpay kusisqam karqani.
He probably doesn’t.	Payqa manapaschá.
So that would have been it.	Chaymi chayqa kanman karqan.
That was a very difficult task.	Chayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi karqa.
Now he was half ready for the ride.	Kunanqa payqa kuskan kasharqan chay carropi rinanpaq.
But, please .	Ichaqa, ama hina kaspa .
It was probably a very difficult one.	Yaqapaschá sinchi sasa kaq.
Clearly it was.	Sut’inmi chay hina karqan.
Where there are two, there will soon be three.	Maypichus iskay kashan chaypiqa pisi tiempollamantan kinsa kanqa.
Safer and faster.	Aswan seguro hinaspa aswan utqaylla.
Maybe he will, someday.	Ichapas ruwanman, huk punchaw.
Or I’ll do it.	Utaq ruwasaq.
I want it to be here.	Kaypi kananta munani.
If, of course, it really is that simple.	Sichus, sut’inmi, cheqaqtapuni chay hina facil kanman chayqa.
Nothing makes sense, that is.	Mana imapas yuyayniyuq, chaymi.
It was no big deal at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hatun ruwaychu karqan.
In fact, it was very large.	Aswanpas ancha hatunmi karqan.
He is right that he did.	Payqa allinmi chayta ruwasqanqa.
Learn about him.	Paymanta yachay.
She had never been this happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hina kusisqachu karqan.
How did I figure out how to do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwanaypaq yuyaykurqani.
Together all the time.	Tukuy tiempopi kuska.
But he died rather quickly.	Ichaqa aswanpas usqhayllan wañupurqan.
Now, that sounds pretty amazing.	Kunanqa, chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi uyarikun.
It was early afternoon.	Chayqa karqa tarde temprano.
You think we didn’t do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwasqaykumanta yuyanki.
But there was a second one.	Ichaqa iskay kaqmi karqan.
I saw him immediately.	Chayllam paytaqa rikurqani.
I can't be here all day.	Manam tukuy punchaw kaypi kayta atiymanchu.
He was drunk, anyway.	Payqa machasqa kasqa, imayna kaptinpas.
It makes no sense at all.	Mana ima yuyayniyuqchu ni imapipas.
But this is a new era.	Ichaqa kaymi mosoq tiempo.
I want to get this right.	Kayta allinta hap’iyta munani.
We did this again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta kayta ruwarqayku.
Now to do this.	Kunanqa kayta ruwananpaq.
He is doing very well.	Ancha allintam ruwachkan.
But of course he was there.	Ichaqa sut’inmi payqa chaypi kasharqan.
That worked out fine.	Chayqa allintam ruwarqa.
It looks like they might be.	Paykunaqa kanman hinam rikchakun.
He really wanted to know about you.	Payqa anchatan qanmanta yachayta munarqan.
I know he did what he wanted.	Yachanim munasqanman hina ruwasqanmanta.
It would have been evil.	Millay kanman karqan.
I don’t believe it either.	Ñuqapas manam creenichu.
Every day was so fresh.	Sapa punchawmi ancha musuq karqa.
It’s better for you.	Aswan allinmi qampaq.
He would love to see this.	Payqa anchatan munanman kayta rikuyta.
This was a pretty bad move.	Kayqa allin mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
You never really know.	Qamqa manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachankichu.
And he couldn’t walk.	Hinaspa mana puriyta atirqachu.
That’s what he could have been.	Chaytan payqa kanman karqan.
I’ll make you some coffee.	Kukata ruwasaq.
You don’t want to overdo it.	Manam munankichu llumpayta.
The result was a very interesting one.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He seemed very busy.	Payqa ancha ocupasqa hinam karqa.
I think it’s up to me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta kasqanmanta.
It was easy all night.	Tukuy tutan facil karqan.
He had a lot of it.	Payqa achkatam karqa.
Once, a month.	Huk kuti, killapi.
Fortunately, that’s pretty easy.	Ancha kusisqa, chayqa ancha facilmi.
he must be the present.	paymi kanan.
This doesn’t make much sense.	Kayqa mana ancha yuyayniyuqchu.
It wasn’t always going to be easy.	Manan sapa kutichu facil kanman karqan.
Or out of town.	Utaq llaqtamanta hawapi.
He’s not good at it.	Payqa manan allinchu chaypiqa.
What a beautiful young man.	Ima sumaq wayna.
I couldn’t wait to sleep.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu puñuyta.
You don’t want him to come back.	Manam munankichu kutimunanta.
That happened one night.	Chayqa huk tutam pasarqa.
This is not good for anything.	Kayqa mana imamantapas allinchu.
I think that’s interesting.	Chayqa sumaqmi nispaymi yuyaykuni.
It was posted yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi churasqa karqa.
Seriously, just don’t do it.	Serio, chaylla ama ruwaychu.
He said he wasn't there.	Paymi nirqa mana chaypichu kasqanmanta.
All this is good.	Tukuy kayqa allinmi.
Yes, for the first time.	Arí, ñawpaq kutita.
So forgive me, please.	Chaymi pampachaykuway, ama hina kaspa.
We can’t let it go.	Manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
No one knew anything for sure.	Manan pipas imatapas allintachu yacharqan.
He left about half an hour early.	Payqa yaqa kuskan hora ñawpaqtaraqmi lluqsirqa.
I was a very rich man.	Ancha qhapaq runam karqani.
You can't actually make this stuff up.	Chiqaptaqa manam kay imakunatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You will soon learn that this is the best way to do it.	Pisi tiempollamantan yachanki chay ruway aswan allin kasqanmanta.
Dozens of people.	Chunka chunka runakuna.
So much worse for you.	Chaymi aswan mana allin qampaq.
You weren’t there with me at all.	Manam ñuqawanqa chaypichu karqanki ni imapipas.
I hope to do this better next year then.	Suyachkani aswan allinta ruwayta kayta hamuq wata chaymanta.
Quickly get somewhere to go.	Utqaylla mayman rinanpaq.
I couldn’t find it.	Mana tariyta atirqanichu.
He said I didn't, but maybe.	Payqa nirqam mana ruwasqayta, ichaqa ichapas.
You are drunk and crazy day and night.	Tuta punchawmi machasqa hinaspa loco kanki.
Bigger than you, boy.	Qammanta aswan hatun, wayna.
Now you are a traveler.	Kunanqa puriq runam kanki.
You don’t have to rush it.	Manan usqhayllachu chaytaqa ruwanayki.
There is plenty of time for this.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon kan.
He couldn't say no.	Payqa manan mana niyta atinmanchu karqan.
Tonight is the night.	Kunan tutaqa tutan.
There is a precedent for this.	Chaypaqqa kanmi ñawpaq kaq.
I think he’s the best in the world.	Paymi kay pachapi aswan allin kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
But something had to happen.	Ichaqa imapas kanan karqan.
But they were very much together.	Ichaqa anchatam kuska karqaku.
You've wronged him, he's hurt and angry.	Payta mana allinta ruwarqanki, payqa k'irisqa, phiñasqa ima kachkan.
Perhaps there is some truth to it.	Yaqapaschá chaypiqa kan wakin cheqaq kaq.
But he wasn’t ready.	Ichaqa manan listochu kasharqan.
Do what you want! 	¡Munasqaykita ruway!
It almost means he’s ready.	Yaqapaschá listoña kashasqanmanta niyta munan.
There is nothing left, no longer, worth doing.	Manañam kanchu, manaña, ruwanapaq hinachu.
He really thought about it a lot.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaypi anchata yuyaykurqan.
Something ugly, something ugly.	Imapas millay, imapas millay.
He still wants that.	Chaytaqa kunankamapas munanmi.
Now it's a daily routine.	Kunanqa sapa p'unchaw ruwaymi.
He can’t afford the money.	Payqa manan qolqeta atinchu.
He’d do it all night.	Tukuy tutan chayta ruwanman.
Happy, happy doing.	Kusisqa, kusisqa ruway.
I’m sure he’s a tough guy.	Seguro kani sinchi runa kasqanmanta.
They were probably crazy after all.	Paykunaqa yaqapaschá loco karqanku tukuy imamanta.
Maybe no one else does.	Ichapas mana pipas chayta ruwanchu.
There's a chance it's not true.	Kanmi chansa mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
he said, smirking.	nispas nisqa.
I’m a human being too.	Ñuqapas runam kani.
I hope it was good.	Suyachkani allin kasqanmanta.
Nothing went right.	Manam imapas allintachu rirqa.
I did it today.	Kunan punchawmi ruwarqani.
And repeat in action.	Hinaspa ruwaypi yapamanta ruway.
You can’t hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyariyta atiwaqchu.
And you’re the one.	Hinaspa qanmi kanki.
I wish we could do that.	Munaymanmi chayta ruwanaykupaq.
I didn't feel comfortable there.	Chaypiqa manam allintachu tarikurqani.
Can't really remember.	Mana chiqaptachu yuyariyta atin.
Sure, it’s readily available.	Seguro, chaylla tarikun.
This is terribly wrong.	Kayqa manchay pantasqa kachkan.
He died a day later.	Huk p’unchay qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
She didn't want to talk to him or see him now.	Payqa manan kunanqa paywan rimayta nitaq rikuyta munarqanchu.
I don’t like anyone anymore.	Manañam pitapas gustanchu.
That is often the best.	Sapa kutim chaymi aswan allinqa.
If you think it will help.	Sichus yuyanki yanapananta.
A real trouble maker.	Chiqap sasachakuy ruwaq.
He didn't know how long that moment was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a tiempo chay rato kasqanmanta.
But this would not be the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He couldn’t wait to find out the truth.	Payqa manan suyayta atirqanchu cheqaq kaqta yachananpaq.
He’s good for her.	Payqa allinmi paypaq.
I’m sure it’s home.	Wasi kasqanmanta seguro kani.
Probably an hour.	Yaqapaschá huk hora.
So go talk to him.	Chaymi riy paywan rimayta.
That’s part of who he is.	Chayqa pi kasqanmanta hukninmi.
But he didn’t do much.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu ruwarqan.
I am proud of that too.	Ñuqapas chaymantam orgulloso kachkani.
I think that’s the biggest thing.	Chaytaqa aswan hatunmi kani.
I think they know what the process is.	Yuyaykuni paykunaqa yachanku ima ruway kasqanmanta.
He was happy the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon kusisqa kasharqan.
We are better off.	Aswan allinmi kanchik.
He was worried that something might go wrong.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan imapas mana allinchu kanman chaymanta.
He seemed very upset that I was there.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam karqa chaypi kasqaymanta.
Otherwise it means nothing.	Mana chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
He said he was fine.	Payqa allinmi kashasqanmanta nisqa.
Okay, so here it is.	Allinmi, chaymi kaypi kachkan.
He didn’t seem to do much of anything.	Mana anchatachu imatapas ruwaq hina karqan.
You this is the new new thing now.	Qam kayqa kunan musuq musuq kaqmi.
You don’t want to do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta munankichu.
And yes, it is.	Hinaspa arí.
He was there for three days.	Payqa kimsa punchawmi karqa.
He was so hungry.	Chayna yarqasqa kasqa.
But nobody wants that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa munanchu.
But you did the right thing.	Ichaqa allintan ruwarqanki.
I wish you were here.	Munaymanmi kaypi kasqaykita.
Do this twice.	Kayta iskay kutita ruway.
But there is a way to do it.	Ichaqa kanmi imayna ruwanapaq.
Yes, this would be a big one.	Arí, kayqa hatunmi kanman.
He is a wise and capable man.	Payqa yachaysapa, allin ruwaq runam.
The future was very uncertain.	Hamuq tiempopiqa ancha mana segurochu karqan.
A very good last meal.	Ancha allin qhipa mikhuy.
I was so worried about what we did the night before.	Ancha llakisqa karqani chay ñawpaq tuta ruwasqaykumanta.
But now, for some reason, he couldn’t stop her.	Ichaqa kunanqa imaraykupas manan hark’ayta atirqanchu.
But then, maybe not.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas mana.
It makes the game better.	Chayqa pukllayta aswan allinta ruwan.
He was angry and scared.	Payqa phiñasqa mancharisqa ima kasqa.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
That’s the only thing that needs to happen.	Chayllam imapas kanan.
I prefer to eat there.	Aswan allinmi chaypi mikhuyta.
They both looked so beautiful, happy.	Iskayninkum ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq karqaku, kusisqa.
Now he has to do things right.	Kunanmi imapas allinta ruwanan.
But he knew he couldn't.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana atisqanmanta.
I can’t hear it.	Manam uyariyta atinichu.
Now it’s never.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas.
He was a really good guy.	Payqa chiqap allin runam karqa.
Too late, too late.	Ancha tarde, ancha tarde.
This is it, folks.	Kaymi, runakuna.
This is what makes him happy.	Kaymi kusisqa tarikun.
I’m not really one type of person.	Manam chiqaptaqa huk laya runachu kani.
Best time ever.	Aswan allin tiempo hayk’aqpas.
Then last year happened.	Chaymanta qayna wata pasarqa.
Tom knew that.	Tomqa chaytan yacharqan.
But he could never help it.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yanapayta atirqanchu.
You want to be like that, okay.	Chayna kaytam munanki, allinmi.
I know there would be many.	Yachanim achka kanman nispa.
I actually thought this all along.	Chiqaptaqa kaytam tukuy tiempo piensarqani.
Everything is well laid out.	Tukuy imapas allintam churasqa kachkan.
How does he do it?	Imaynatataq payqa?
Yes, it’s probably.	Arí, yaqapaschá.
But you’ll do better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan ruwanki.
It was supposed to be beautiful.	Sumaqmi kanan karqa.
The best thing was to do it.	Aswan allinqa karqan chayta ruwaymi.
Such a smart kid.	Chayna yachaysapa wawa.
Now go, baby.	Kunanqa riy, wawa.
I don’t know yet.	Manaraq yachanichu.
This is actually not good at all.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa manam allinchu ni imapipas.
This is a good first step.	Kayqa allin ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi.
So, there it is.	Chaymi, chaypi kachkan.
Tell me something about it.	Chaymanta imatapas willaway.
I was happy there, very happy.	Chaypi kusisqa karqani, ancha kusisqa.
The truth is the worst.	Cheqaq kaqmi aswan mana allinqa.
But everyone is terrified.	Ichaqa llapa runan mancharisqa kashanku.
It is no longer true in this day and age.	Kay tiempopiqa manañan cheqaqchu.
I can’t do that now.	Manam kunanqa chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
He didn’t quite know how.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imaynatachus chayta.
If he did, that’s fine.	Sichus chayta ruwarqan chayqa, allinmi.
Not sure what he means here.	Mana segurochu kaypi ima niyta munan.
This whole thing was wrong.	Kay tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I'm looking for something.	Imatapas maskachkani.
He is always with me.	Sapa kutim ñuqawan kachkan.
But that’s what you want.	Ichaqa chaytan munanki.
But here’s everything you need to know.	Ichaqa kaypi tukuy ima yachasqaykita yachanki.
He needs money.	Payqa qolqetan necesitan.
I didn’t expect you to be pretty.	Manam suyarqanichu sumaq rikchayniyuq kanaykita.
I did that a while ago.	Chaytaqa huk rato ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqani.
But it will still be there.	Ichaqa hinallam kanqa.
I would like him to come back.	Munaymanmi kutimunanta.
I think that's what it's all about.	Chayqa tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensani.
No one ever does that.	Manam pipas haykapipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
No, it wasn’t.	Manan manan karqanchu.
He wanted to see the city.	Chay llaqtata rikuyta munarqa.
So today is the day.	Chaymi kunan punchawqa chay punchaw.
He looked to the future.	Payqa hamuq tiempotan qhawarirqan.
That’s one of the best things.	Chayqa huknin aswan allin kaqmi.
And this was a big one.	Hinaspa kayqa hatunmi karqa.
I know he will speak well.	Yachanim allinta rimananpaq.
He couldn’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atinmanchu karqan.
He had no idea what it was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
He didn’t want to see her.	Payqa manan rikuyta munarqanchu.
But it’s ridiculous.	Ichaqa asikunapaq hinam.
It was the next big thing.	Chayqa qhepa kaq hatun kaqmi karqan.
Being a good judge.	Allin yuyayniyuq kay.
But it was a beautiful day all said.	Ichaqa sumaq p’unchaymi karqan llapan nisqa.
He was there alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi kasqa.
You probably want to be sure.	Yaqapaschá seguro kayta munanki.
I had to do this right.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwanay karqa.
He must always be ready to act.	Payqa sapa kutim listo kanan imatapas ruwananpaq.
At this point you might want to reconsider.	Kaypiqa ichapas hukmanta yuyaymanayta munanki.
He wants to help.	Payqa yanapayta munan.
It's still something else that's still out there.	Hinallam huk imapas chayraqmi hawapi kachkan.
To do the job.	Ruwanapaq.
He could never stop her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas hark’ayta atirqanchu.
Yes the latter.	Arí qhipa.
Not always true.	Mana sapa kutichu chiqap.
I'm pretty sure he did the right thing.	Yaqa segurom kani allinta ruwasqanmanta.
Everything was baseball.	Tukuy imapas béisbol nisqa karqan.
You can't do it here.	Kaypiqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
So crazy good.	Chaymi loco allin.
He seemed unfazed.	Payqa mana mancharisqa hinam karqa.
Or, rather, that he didn’t.	Utaq, aswan allinta, mana ruwasqanmanta.
I just don’t know how to do this.	Chaylla mana yachanichu kayta ruwayta.
I don’t feel that good.	Manam chayna allintachu sientekuni.
I always think it was him, or her.	Sapa kutim piensani pay kasqanmanta, utaq paymanta.
Yes, they were both there.	Arí, iskayninkum chaypi karqaku.
That fact is irrelevant.	Chay cheqaq kaqmi mana imapaqpas valenchu.
One hour, please hurry.	Huk hora, ama hina kaspa usqhaylla.
That’s a quick one.	Chayqa usqhayllan.
I just want to do that again.	Chayta hukmanta ruwayta munani chaylla.
But in doing so, he made a discovery.	Ichaqa chayta ruwaspan huk tariyta ruwarqan.
It happened once a week.	Semanapi huk kutitam chayna pasarqa.
Please don’t forget this.	Ama hina kaspa, ama kayta qunqaychu.
He will come alone.	Payqa sapallanmi hamunqa.
But then he drove off.	Ichaqa chaymantam carronta rirqa.
That’s a nice thing to do.	Chayqa sumaq ruwaymi.
He always did this right.	Payqa sapa kutim kayta allinta ruwarqa.
Who doesn’t want to do their homework.	Pitaq mana tareankunata ruwayta munanchu.
No one could have predicted the atrocities.	Manan pipas willayta atinmanchu karqan chay mana allin ruwaykunata.
I feel tired of it all.	Tukuy chaymanta sayk’usqa sientekuni.
But it's very clear.	Ichaqa ancha sut'inmi.
There must be a hidden treasure there.	Chaypiqa pakasqa qhapaq kaymi kanan.
He's obviously a guy.	Payqa sut'inmi huk wayna.
For the sake of things in the world.	Kay pachapi imapas allin kananpaq.
Beautiful evening.	Sumaq ch'isi.
He realized that he was fine.	Payqa repararqanmi allin kashasqanmanta.
Isn’t that right.	Manachu chayna.
I tried to be a little realistic.	Huk chikan chiqap kananpaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
That would be better than this.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman kaymantaqa.
He couldn't understand.	Payqa manam entiendeyta atirqachu.
But there was nothing, nothing.	Ichaqa manan imapas karqanchu, manan imapas karqanchu.
She was a party girl.	Payqa fiestapi sipasmi karqan.
Now everything feels strange.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas mana riqsisqa hinam tarikun.
I saw him, one night.	Payta rikurqani, huk tuta.
The first sentence is slightly more ambiguous.	Ñawpaq rimayqa aswan pisi iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
That’s the best way to say thank you.	Chayqa aswan allinmi gracias niyta.
He can no longer act like anyone else.	Manañan huk runa hina ruwayta atinchu.
He was furious.	Payqa sinchitan phiñasqa kasharqan.
And he was hungry.	Hinan payqa yarqaymanta kasharqan.
Perhaps it would have been better otherwise.	Ichapas mana chayna kaptinqa aswan allin kanman karqa.
He was crazy, really crazy.	Payqa loco kasqa, chiqap loco.
But who really knows.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq chiqaptapuni yachan.
Yeah, that’s good.	Arí, chay allin.
I wish that happened more often.	Aswan sapa kuti chayna kananta munayman.
If not, please let me know!.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa willaway!.
Both are wrong.	Iskayninkum pantasqa kachkanku.
He is doing everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwachkan.
They were all in the present.	Llapallankum kunan tiempopi karqaku.
It was always with me.	Sapa kutim ñuqawanqa karqa.
He always said he could handle it.	Payqa sapa kutim nirqa chayta aguantayta atisqanmanta.
That’s what he approved of.	Chaytan payqa allinpaq qhawarirqan.
In fact, he didn’t say much at all.	Aswanpas manan anchatachu rimarqan ni imapipas.
All good deeds and recognition in the world.	Tukuy allin ruway, riqsisqa kay pachapi.
Unfortunately, it was to be.	Llakikuypaqmi chayna kanan karqa.
In fact, he probably took it seriously.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá chayta allinpaq qhawarirqan.
I don’t like it anymore.	Manañam gustanchu.
Everything will be great.	Lliwmi hatun kanqa.
Everything was never right.	Tukuy imapas manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
Now that’s not all.	Kunanqa manan chayllachu.
And then he does it again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta ruwan.
In the other prison.	Huknin carcelpi.
They were here a few days ago.	Iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi kaypi karqaku.
And, maybe he did.	Hinaspa, ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
Not sure there is but who knows.	Mana segurochu kan ichaqa pi yachan.
Then, anyway.	Chaymanta, imayna kaptinpas.
One is the first one.	Hukninmi ñawpaq kaq.
He couldn’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikuyta atirqachu.
I want to be arrested.	Ñuqaqa hapisqa kaytam munani.
He doesn't want to eat anything, alone.	Mana imatapas mikuyta munanchu, sapallan.
It was such a simple thing, after all.	Chayna facil kaqmi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
Tougher crowd there.	Aswan sinchi achka runakuna chaypi.
I thought it was a wonderful summer.	Yuyarqanin sumaq verano kananpaq.
I want to know everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imatapas yachayta munani.
Obviously this can be difficult.	Sut’inmi chay ruwayqa sasa kanman.
I know now that he doesn't think about anything.	Kunanmi yachani mana imapipas piensasqanmanta.
Yes, it would have been great.	Arí, ancha allinmi kanman karqa.
But he has to do it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwanan.
You’re not good enough yet.	Manaraqmi allinchu kanki.
But it’s okay.	Ichaqa allinmi kashan.
This is very important today.	Kunan tiempopiqa ancha allinmi kayqa.
But now it seemed almost like he was.	Ichaqa kunanqa yaqapaschá payqa kanman hina karqan.
That was kind of cold, all right.	Chayqa chiri hinam karqa, allinmi.
It’s really up to you.	Chiqamanta qammanta kanqa.
He’s afraid to ask.	Payqa manchakunmi tapuyta.
Perform the following steps.	Kay ruwaykunata ruway.
I can sing the song.	Takiyta atiyman.
He is very upset.	Payqa anchatam llakisqa kachkan.
A yes or no.	Huk arí icha mana.
He was always, always busy.	Payqa sapa kutim, sapa kutim ocupasqa karqa.
One of them may be right for you.	Hukninmi qampaq hina kanman.
That was you, that’s you.	Chay hina karqan qan, chay hina qan.
Instead, he was devastated.	Aswanpas payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
I don’t want to hear that talk.	Manam chay rimayta uyariyta munanichu.
He didn't really know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa allintachu yacharqan.
I mean, it was great.	Niyta munani, hatunmi karqan.
School.	Yachay wasi.
First, what it isn’t.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ima mana kasqanmanta.
She asked sternly.	Payqa sinchitan tapurqan.
Many people want to do it.	Askha runakunaqa ruwayta munanku.
However, this is a realistic process.	Ichaqa, kayqa chiqap ruwaymi.
That is something that needs to be done.	Chayqa hinallam ruwana.
I’m kind of proud of that.	Chaymantaqa huk laya orgulloso kani.
You are a beautiful girl.	Sumaq sipasmi kanki.
I had to be sober.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kanay karqa.
No one can do it any other way.	Manan pipas huk hinaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
And it was really great.	Hinaspa chiqap hatunmi karqa.
I can’t imagine what might be involved.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu chaypi imakuna kanman chayta.
He’s a great baseball player.	Payqa hatun béisbol pukllaqmi.
I’m a human being.	Ñuqam runa kani.
I know it won’t happen.	Yachanim mana pasananta.
He said you know.	Payqa yachanki nispam nirqa.
Almost there! 	Yaqa chaypi!
So we have to act accordingly.	Chaymi chayman hina ruwananchik.
He now knew what he had to do.	Payqa kunanqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
There was nothing better.	Manam imapas aswan allinqa karqachu.
Then it went wrong.	Chaymantam mana allintachu rirqa.
Everything was fast.	Tukuy imapas utqayllam karqa.
But not everything is good.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas allinchu.
You’re right here.	Kaypiqa allinmi kachkanki.
I wanted to be immediate.	Chaylla kaytam munarqani.
He stayed one night.	Payqa huk tutan qhepakurqan.
Canada a little bit.	Canadá huk chikan.
You didn’t seem scared.	Mana mancharisqa hinachu karqanki.
Why did he do that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa.
But if he thought that, it was wrong.	Ichaqa sichus chayta yuyaykurqan chayqa, manan allinchu karqan.
It is the best thing in the world.	Kay pachapi imamantapas aswan allinmi.
Yes, you are beautiful.	Arí, sumaqmi kanki.
It wasn't good enough, he knew.	Manam allinchu karqa, chaytam yacharqa.
Maybe next week.	Ichapas hamuq semanapi.
He was the easiest man.	Payqa aswan facil runan karqan.
I'm sure it's better that way.	Seguro kani chayna aswan allin kasqanmanta.
I know better now.	Kunanqa aswan allintam yachani.
He was really crazy.	Payqa chiqaptam loco karqa.
it’s not safe.	mana segurochu.
I am who I am.	Ñuqaqa kani pichus kani.
Unfortunately you don’t know that yet.	Llakikuypaqmi manaraq chayta yachankichu.
What a terrible thing to do.	Ima manchay ruwaymi.
But I didn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nirqani.
Isn’t it now.	Manachu kunanqa.
But now something told me there was a problem.	Ichaqa kunanmi imapas niwarqa huk sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I’m not going to go there.	Manam chaymanqa risaqchu.
I need him to do something.	Imatapas ruwananpaqmi necesitasaq.
And another difficult day.	Hinaspa huk sasa punchaw.
Everything is good, here.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, kaypi.
There’s some tea in there.	Chaypin kashan wakin chayta.
This is a bad idea.	Kayqa mana allin yuyayniyuq kaymi.
It just happened too fast.	Chayllaraqmi llumpay utqaylla pasarqa.
Like last year.	Qayna wata hina.
I don’t like it or dislike it.	Manam gustanchu nitaq mana gustanchu.
In fact, he did it twice.	Aswanpas iskay kutitan chayta ruwarqan.
They are angry and frustrated.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa, hukmanyasqa ima kanku.
And he was very frightened.	Hinaspa ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
I had nowhere else to go.	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq karqachu.
It’s hard to do that.	Chayta ruwayqa sasam.
He’s a nice guy, you know.	Payqa sumaq runam, yachanki.
I really want to quit.	Anchatam munani saqiyta.
No, no, that's not good.	Mana, mana, chayqa mana allinchu.
I wasn’t really hungry.	Manam chiqaptachu yarqasqa karqani.
Now more and more people are aware of it.	Kunanqa aswan achka runakunam chaytaqa yachanku.
A year without him.	Huk wata mana paywan.
He felt very ill.	Payqa ancha unqusqa hinam tarikurqa.
That crazy fool.	Chay loco sonso.
This was a very successful process.	Kaymi karqan ancha allin ruway.
This is actually not too difficult to do.	Kayqa chiqamanta mana ancha sasa ruwaychu.
But no longer there at all.	Ichaqa manaña chaypichu ni imapipas.
He wasn't supposed to be there.	Payqa manam chaypichu kanan karqa.
Never needed anything.	Mana hayk’aqpas imatapas necesitarqanchu.
But I didn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munarqanichu.
I was fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi karqani.
So I’ll be terribly speechless.	Chaymi manchay mana rimaq kasaq.
Good, good guy.	Allin, allin runa.
Which is really great.	Imataq chiqap hatun.
He didn’t know how to drive.	Payqa manan carrota manejayta yacharqanchu.
That would obviously be very difficult.	Chay ruwayqa sut’inmi ancha sasa kanman.
He’s being looked at.	Payqa qhawarisqa kashan.
But you are the best.	Ichaqa qanmi aswan allinqa.
Yes, that hurt so badly.	Arí, chaymi sinchita k’irisqa karqan.
So you can’t come with me.	Chaymi mana ñoqawanqa hamuyta atiwaqchu.
We did it again tonight.	Kunan tutam yapamanta ruwarqayku.
There are no more people.	Manañam runakunaqa kanchu.
He died three years later.	Kinsa wata qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
You know what those two are like.	Yachankim chay iskay imayna kasqankuta.
And that’s it for now.	Hinaspa chaymi kunankamaqa.
He seemed proud of it.	Payqa chaymantaqa orgulloso hinam karqa.
By doing his best.	Tukuy atisqanman hina ruwaspa.
It has never been so easy.	Manam haykapipas chayna facilchu karqa.
But too much of it is so bad.	Ichaqa llumpay chaymantaqa chayna mana allinmi.
It looks better, but it's hard to do.	Aswan allin rikchayniyuq, ichaqa sasa ruwanapaq.
This is the worst part of the night.	Kayqa tutamanta aswan mana allin kaqmi.
Not too difficult, but very useful.	Mana ancha sasachu, aswanpas ancha allinmi.
Everything is set up.	Tukuy ima churasqa kachkan.
Else .	Mana chayqa .
Clearly, this was not the case.	Sut’inmi kashan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Now it's clearer.	Kunanqa aswan sut'inmi.
But that's all for now.	Ichaqa chayllam kunankamaqa.
He’s the one who did it.	Paymi ruwarqa.
He walked home.	Payqa wasinman puriq.
They are not like you or me.	Paykunaqa manan qan hinachu nitaq ñoqa hinachu kanku.
But things went wrong.	Ichaqa mana allintam imapas pasarqa.
You know the speed.	Chay utqaylla kaqta yachanki.
I wanted more from him.	Aswan achkatam paymanta munarqani.
But it was too fast.	Ichaqa llumpay utqayllam karqa.
This one was easy.	Kayqa facilmi karqa.
He could hardly have gone.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana riyta atinmanchu karqan.
So very, very cold.	Chaymi ancha, ancha chiri.
He knew it would be good one day.	Payqa yacharqanmi huk p’unchay allin kananta.
Hard to tell really.	Sasa willay chiqaptapuni.
Today we are a modern man.	Kunanqa kunan pacha runam kanchik.
You can do this later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi ruwawaq.
I hope the latter makes sense to you.	Suyachkani kay qhipa kaq qampaq yuyayniyuq kananta.
The best people in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan allin runakuna.
Yes, one of him.	Arí, paymanta huknin.
But I’m not sure why you would do this.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani imaraykun kayta ruwawaq chayta.
It would be nice one day.	Sumaqmi kanman huk punchaw.
Again, this is something you almost never want to do.	Yapamanta, kayqa yaqa mana hayk’aqpas ruwayta munankichu.
I know the way from here.	Kaymanta ñanta yachani.
But perhaps this was better.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kayqa aswan allin karqan.
Couldn’t be happier.	Manan aswan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu.
This shouldn't be that difficult.	Kayqa manam chayna sasachu kanan.
You have a	Qamqa huk .
He was always ahead of his ideas.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi ñawpaqpi karqan imachus yuyaykusqanmanta.
I've never heard of this before.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa uyarirqanichu.
They may not always be there.	Manapaschá sapa kutichu chaypiqa kanku.
It all felt so confusing.	Tukuy imapas ancha pantasqa hinam tarikurqa.
He was exhausted.	Sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
I don’t always know why.	Manam sapa kutichu yachani imanasqa chaytaqa.
You can no longer be a teacher.	Manañam yachachiq kayta atiwaqchu.
But this was a big one.	Ichaqa kayqa hatunmi karqa.
I did something stupid last night.	Qayna tutan huk sonso ruwayta ruwarqani.
He looks much better.	Payqa aswan allinmi rikchakun.
He was unlucky.	Payqa mana suerteyoqmi kasqa.
Learn if it’s not easier for you.	Yachay mana aswan facilchu kanki chayqa.
The last day of the process.	Ruway qhipa p’unchaw.
Unlike today.	Mana kunan punchaw hinaqa.
If, that is, they want to help.	Sichus, chaymi, paykunaqa yanapayta munanku chayqa.
He can sleep here.	Payqa kaypim puñuyta atin.
I want to make a lot of coffee.	Achka kukata ruwayta munani.
So far, this statement is valid.	Kunankamaqa kay rimayqa allinmi.
They want you to succeed.	Paykunaqa munanku allinta ruwasqaykita.
He doesn’t talk much about her.	Payqa manan anchatachu paymanta riman.
Something that’s not there.	Imapas mana chaypi kaq.
The strong man.	Chay sinchi runa.
I’m holding the money.	Qolqetan hap’ini.
It would be hard to overstate its importance.	Sasam kanman ancha allin kasqanmanta llumpayta rimayqa.
One, that is.	Huknin, chaymi.
It wasn’t a good idea.	Manam allin yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
He is a very rich man.	Payqa ancha qhapaq runam.
Maybe it’s unreasonable and maybe it’s not.	Ichapas mana yuyayniyuq kanman manapaschá.
Tom might be able to do that.	Tomqa ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman.
He didn't have to do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwanan karqa.
He didn’t really say that.	Chaytaqa manan cheqaqtachu nirqan.
It’s very difficult now.	Ancha sasam kunanqa.
You want to help.	Yanapayta munanki.
That would not have been difficult.	Chay ruwayqa manan sasachu kanman karqan.
No, that sounds good.	Manan, chayqa allinmi uyarikun.
But it wasn’t supposed to be that hard.	Ichaqa manan chay hina sasachu kanan karqan.
That will be ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam kanqa.

She could tell he was disappointed.	Payqa repararqanmi hukmanyasqa kashasqanmanta.
So much to do, so little time to do.	Ancha achka ruwanapaq, pisi tiempo ruwanapaq.
Everything beyond that.	Tukuy chaymanta hawapi.
It was better all injury considered.	Aswan allinmi karqan llapan k’irisqa qhawarisqa.
Obviously this is too much.	Sut’inmi kayqa nishuta.
Maybe both of them.	Ichapas iskayninku.
Something that is real.	Imapas chiqap kaqmi.
Quick, quick thinking.	Utqaylla, utqaylla yuyayniyuq.
But that wouldn’t be like him.	Ichaqa chayqa manan pay hinachu kanman.
And indeed indeed.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni.
But it is nowhere to be found.	Ichaqa manan maypipas kanchu.
He still smoked cigarettes.	Payqa hinallam cigarrota pitaq.
He was scared, yes.	Payqa mancharisqa, arí.
I said the truth.	Cheqaqtapunin nirqani.
I wonder what ever happened to him.	Tapukunitaqmi ima haykapipas paywan pasasqanmanta.
But it’s like that every day.	Ichaqa sapa p’unchaymi chhayna kashan.
I think about it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa piensani.
Go on, give it a try.	Riy, huk kutita ruway.
So yeah, it was nice.	Chaymi arí, sumaqmi karqa.
You never know that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
He can’t be here much longer.	Payqa manan aswan unaytachu kaypi kanman.

But one day, it won't work out.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi, mana allinchu kanqa.
The traveling people.	Chay puriq runakuna.
Someone’s going to get hurt.	Pipas k’irisqa kanqa.
You can’t tell.	Manan yachayta atiwaqchu.
He was very tired, he said.	Ancha sayk’usqa kasqa, nispas nin.
I hope you learned something.	Suyachkani imatapas yachasqaykita.
They were very much together.	Paykunaqa anchatam kuska karqaku.
Yeah, it’s not good at all.	Arí, mana allinchu ni imapipas.
Like being a child.	Wawa kay hina.
And he’s here with me.	Hinaspa payqa kaypi ñuqawan kachkan.
It’s been out there for a long time.	Unayñan chay hawapi kashan.
That was not so easy though.	Chayqa karqan manan chay hina facilchu ichaqa.
You are the best person in the world.	Qamqa kay pachapi aswan allin runam kanki.
I really hope you do.	Chiqamanta suyachkani chayta ruwanaykipaq.
If it weren't for him, it would be someone else.	Mana pay kaptinqa huk runam kanman.
So, that day.	Chaymi, chay punchaw.
I know how to do what is right.	Allin kaqta ruwayta yachani.
The greatest you can do.	Aswan hatun ruway atisqaykita.
Yes, it is not.	Arí, manam hinachu.
He always talked about you.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi qanmanta rimaq.
Nothing went together.	Manam imapas kuskachu rirqa.
Needless to say, it doesn't.	Manañam niyta munanichu mana chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But that is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chay ruwayqa.
Better not to do it out here, anyway.	Aswan allinmi kay hawapi mana ruway, imayna kaptinpas.
I know you can get there.	Yachanim chayman chayayta atisqaykita.
Of course, this was not always the case.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
Being a lonely person.	Sapallan runa kay.
This was completely wrong.	Kayqa tukuy imamanta mana allinchu karqa.
It could have been something.	Imapas kanman karqan.
It will be easier.	Aswan facilmi kanqa.
I came up with another way to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi huk ruwaytapas yuyaykurqani.
Yes, that was a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi karqa.
And it was a great day.	Hinaspa chay punchawqa hatun punchawmi karqa.
I wish it wasn’t.	Mana chayna kananta munayman.
I'm fine actually.	Allinmi kani chiqaptaqa.
But I thought it was very strange.	Ichaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi chaytaqa piensarqani.
He was here, and that was all.	Payqa kaypim karqa, chayllam karqa.
He was outside the box.	Payqa hawapi kasqa.
I didn’t think about that.	Chaypiqa manan yuyaykurqanichu.
Maybe you want to talk about it.	Ichapas chaymanta rimayta munanki.
This wasn’t like him, she said.	Kayqa manan pay hinachu karqan, nispas nin.
He was quick and fast.	Payqa usqhayllan usqhaylla ruwaq.
I think that's smart.	Chayqa yachaysapa kasqanmantam piensani.
A girl, however, was there.	Huk sipasmi ichaqa chaypi kasharqan.
Went over there again.	Yapamanta chay hawaman rirqa.
This is really, really bad.	Kayqa chiqap, chiqap mana allinmi.
I still didn’t want to leave.	Kunankamapas manam ripuyta munarqanichu.
Very good, actually.	Ancha allin, chiqaptaqa.
And everything else.	Hinaspa tukuy imatapas.
I think he has no choice.	Yuyaykuni mana ima ruwaytapas atisqanmanta.
I was so stupid.	Ñuqaqa ancha sonso karqani.
If you do this, stop doing this.	Kayta ruwanki chayqa, amaña kayta ruwaychu.
The oldest was thirty.	Kuraq kaqmi karqa kimsa chunka.
I hear that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim uyarini.
He looked better.	Payqa aswan allinta qhawarisqa.
It is pointless to pretend.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​hina ruwayqa.
It’s really me.	Chiqaptam ñuqa kani.
It's doing pretty much what it should be.	Yaqa imayna kanan hinam ruwachkan.
This is a very big deal for him.	Kayqa ancha hatunmi paypaq.
He let it be there.	Chaypi kananta saqirqa.
It’s not like people.	Manan runakuna hinachu.
But it’s a big deal.	Ichaqa hatun ruwaymi.
But, if he was gone.	Ichaqa, sichus payqa manaña karqanchu chayqa.
I didn’t listen either.	Ñuqapas mana uyarirqanichu.
He is not the man in the past.	Manam ñawpaqpi kaq runachu.

He didn’t want to go there.	Payqa manan chaymanqa riyta munarqanchu.
Tell me when.	Willaway haykapi.
There was no truer statement.	Aswan chiqap rimayqa manam karqachu.
It didn’t work out that way.	Manam chaynatachu lluqsirqa.
It will probably have to be big.	Yaqapaschá hatun kanan kanqa.
He could find nothing.	Payqa manan imatapas tariyta atirqanchu.
They’re not really married.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu casarasqa kanku.
I never knew that.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
I wish it was.	Munaymanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
If you do, everything will be fine.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
In fact, everything is great.	Aswanpas tukuy imapas ancha allinmi.
It was such an amazing experience.	Chayna admirakuypaqmi karqa.
You’ll be looked at more severely.	Aswan sinchi qhawarisqa kanki.
That means things can actually be good.	Chayqa niyta munan, chiqamanta imapas allin kanman.
And that’s the first one.	Hinaspa chay ñawpaq kaq.
That shouldn't be too difficult.	Chayqa manam ancha sasachu kanan.
You don’t know where it is.	Manan yachankichu maypi kashasqanmanta.
He had to do something right.	Payqa allintan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Otherwise he was alone in the house.	Mana chayqa sapallanmi chay wasipi kasqa.
He is the	Payqa chay .
What’s the matter with it.	¿Imataq chaymanta.
Three weeks later he died.	Kinsa semana qhepamanmi payqa wañupurqan.

He knows it’s wrong.	Payqa yachanmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
That was always going to happen.	Chayqa sapa kutillanmi kanan karqan.
Nothing here in town.	Mana imapas kaypi llaqtapi.
Now same problem again.	Kunanqa kikin sasachakuy yapamanta.
He wants to find it.	Payqa tariyta munan.
I know how to drive.	Yachanim imayna manejayta.
They know you know the truth.	Paykunaqa yachanku cheqaq kaqta yachasqaykita.
People were driven out.	Runakunaqa qarqusqa karqanku.
I wonder where he is now.	Kunanqa maypi kasqanmantam tapukuni.
But this doesn’t mean it won’t happen.	Ichaqa kayqa manan niyta munanchu mana kanqachu.
He knows nothing about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yachanchu.
But there's one thing he can't do.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi mana ruwayta atinchu.
It wouldn’t be much.	Manam anchatachu kanman.
Good morning, good evening.	Allin p’unchaw, allin ch’isi.
To make it more injurious.	Aswan k’irisqa kananpaq.
That’s right, yes.	Chayqa arí.

He couldn’t find a buyer.	Manas rantiyta tariyta atirqachu.
So it’s for you.	Chaymi qanpaq kashan.

It was a very sad day.	Chay punchawqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
It was a long day ago.	Chay punchawqa unayñam karqa.
He wanted to leave but couldn't.	Ripuyta munarqa ichaqa manam atirqachu.
He’s not doing exactly the hard work.	Payqa manan allintachu sasa llank’ayta ruwashan.
Very ugly indeed.	Ancha millay chiqap.
But it won’t be a big deal.	Ichaqa manan hatun ruwaychu kanqa.
He knew what she was feeling.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima sientekusqanmanta.
But how about every day.	Ichaqa imaynatataq sapa punchaw.
Of course, this would be optional.	Arí, kayqa munasqanman hinam kanman.
I’m sure you’re tired.	Seguro sayk’usqañan kashanki.
Why, they obviously know.	Imarayku, sut’inmi yachanku.

And he couldn’t.	Hinan payqa mana atirqanchu.
Everything he had to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.

And then something else happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk imapas pasarqa.
Don’t do it right away.	Mana chaylla ruway.
He told me he never wanted to see her again.	Paymi niwarqa manaña haykapipas rikuyta munasqanmanta.
Not so much with me.	Mana anchatachu ñuqawan.
I always knew that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa yacharqani.
It’s probably not a bad thing.	Manapaschá mana allinchu.
She was as beautiful as you are.	Payqa qan hina sumaqmi karqan.
He's a little unsure.	Payqa huk chikan mana segurochu kachkan.
Tell me how it’s going to be.	Imayna kananta willaway.
Or he told me.	Utaq niwarqa.
He’s actually a teacher.	Payqa chiqaptaqa yachachiqmi.
Please, please do so.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa, chay hinata ruway.
He has always been there.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi karqa.

I couldn’t do anything about it.	Mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Which is the second biggest.	Imataq iskay kaq hatun.

It means everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi niyta munan.
And that is the biggest problem today.	Hinaspa chaymi kunan tiempopi aswan hatun sasachakuy.
He was a lot of people.	Payqa achka runam karqa.
It should be done twice.	Iskay kutitam ruwanan.

Now that’s how it was.	Kunanqa chayna kasqa.
What’s more, again there was no one.	Imataq aswan, yapamanta mana pipas karqan.

I wanted to be a teacher.	Yachachiq kaytam munarqani.
He is intensely involved.	Payqa sinchitan chaypi kashan.
And now he’s not the worse for it.	Hinaspa kunanqa manan chaypaqqa aswan mana allinchu.
But I knew better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan yacharqani.
Tomorrow is the best day.	Paqarin punchawmi aswan allinqa.
So you never know how that happens.	Chaymi mana haykapipas yachankichu imayna chayna kasqanmantaqa.
It looked cold and hungry.	Chayqa chiri yarqasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
And then, he.	Hinaspa chaymanta, pay.
It was sad and miserable.	Llakikuypaqmi hinaspa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
So, for goodness sake.	Chaymi, allin kananpaq.
No one’s been caught.	Mana pipas hap’isqa.
That was supposed to be the year.	Chayqa wata kanan karqa.
That unfortunately failed.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He felt so stupid.	Payqa ancha sonso hinam tarikurqa.
He didn't seem to be there.	Manas chaypichu rikchakurqa.
Maybe one night.	Ichapas huk tuta.
They were always constant.	Sapa kutim sapa kutilla chayna karqaku.
After all, he was there.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa chaypi kachkarqa.
There is no time for that.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempon kanchu.

Beauty is in the process.	Sumaq kayqa ruwaypi kachkan.
Nothing new, either.	Mana imapas musuq, nitaq.
That's when it happened.	Chayqa hayk'aqmi karqan.
He didn’t need this, anymore.	Kaytaqa manan necesitarqanchu, manañan.

However, it was good.	Ichaqa, allinmi karqan.
But no one said it was.	Ichaqa manan pipas nirqanchu chhayna kasqanmantaqa.
I mean, sure.	Niyta munani, seguro.
I mean, is it better than that?.	Niyta munani, chaymanta aswan allinchu?.
This is not beauty.	Kayqa manam sumaq kaychu.
Probably less than that.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa aswan pisi.
You’re doing it right.	Qamqa chayta ruwachkanki.
Ten years from now you wish you had.	Chunka wata qhepamanmi munanki chayta ruwanaykita.
Why did it take so long.	¿Imanasqataq chayna unayta pasarqa.

But perhaps someone left.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá pipas ripurqan.
They were really pretty good.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam allin allin karqaku.
He doesn’t want to catch it.	Payqa manam hapiyta munanchu.
Maybe they are both.	Ichapas iskayninku kanku.
He did a lot of that.	Payqa achkatam chayta ruwarqa.
Everyone except me.	Llapallankum mana ñuqallachu.
Maybe it always was.	Ichapas sapa kuti chayna karqa.
Maybe both together.	Ichapas iskayninku kuska.
I was very proud of this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam orgulloso karqani.
He was always like this.	Payqa sapa kutim kayna karqa.
I know he likes her.	Yachanim pay gustasqanmanta.
You always want this.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim munanki.
That way it’s better.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi.
But this is not too difficult.	Ichaqa manan sinchi sasachu kayqa.
Without it, he is not yet human.	Mana chaywanqa manaraqmi runachu.
It doesn’t seem difficult.	Manam sasa hinachu.
He stayed there for a long time.	Chaypin unayta qhepakurqan.
He was the first to go.	Paymi ñawpaqtaqa rirqa.
You want to buy a cup of coffee.	Huk kukata rantiyta munanki.

I thought he was a great and successful man.	Payqa hatun hinaspa allin ruwaq runa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Yes, they were there again.	Arí, hukmanta chaypi karqanku.
One injury, maybe two.	Huk k’irisqa, ichapas iskay.
In a way, this could be a good thing.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, kayqa allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t tell her everything.	Payqa manan tukuy imatapas willayta atirqanchu.
He was right, and she knew it.	Payqa allintan rimarqan, payqa chaytan yacharqan.
I'm sure it's all for the best.	Seguro kani tukuy imata allinpaq kasqanmanta.
Several times, and probably.	Achka kuti, hinaspa yaqapaschá.
He is a teacher there.	Payqa chaypi yachachiqmi.
That is certainly a good thing.	Cheqaqtapunin chayqa allinpaq qhawarisqa.
Maybe he’s drunk.	Ichapas payqa machasqa kachkan.
I don't want to be serious here.	Kaypiqa manam serio rimayta munanichu.
It was night, so he was drunk.	Tuta kasqa, chaymi machasqa kasqa.
It’s very unreasonable.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Okay, not always serious.	Allinmi, manam sapa kutichu serio.

Rather than being alone.	Aswan sapallan kasqanmantaqa.
This is what really matters.	Kaymi chiqaptapuni ancha allinqa.
Do the truth.	Chiqap kaqta ruway.
So it’s almost always there.	Chaymi yaqa sapa kuti chaypi kachkan.
You know what everyone else is like.	Yachankim llapa runa imayna kasqankuta.
He thinks about it every night.	Chaypin sapa tuta yuyaykun.
I don’t know why this would be a good thing.	Mana yachanichu imaraykutaq kayqa allin kanman.
Tomorrow, for sure.	Paqarin, seguro.
I always knew you would.	Sapa kutim yacharqani chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I just couldn’t help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atirqanichu.
He was a big deal.	Payqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
But you’re lucky, unlike me.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kanki, manan ñoqa hinachu.
It’s really, really hard.	Chiqap, chiqap sasam.
I couldn’t tell before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam willayta atirqanichu.
But that was three years ago.	Ichaqa chayqa kinsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I'm looking for it all the time.	Tukuy pacha maskachkani.

I can do things very, very quickly.	Ancha ancha utqayllam imatapas ruwayman.
That’s a pretty big if.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi sichus.
To no one's surprise, it didn't work out.	Mana pimanpas admirakuypaqmi, manam allintachu lluqsirqa.

But really everything.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapuni tukuy ima.
Don't sound like a real person.	Ama chiqap runa hinachu chayqa uyarikun.
Everyone was disappointed.	Lliwmi hukmanyasqa karqaku.
He can do it now, he can do it here.	Payqa kunan ruwayta atinman, kaypi ruwayta atinman.
He is indeed a very rich man.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ancha qhapaq runa.
One and a half hours.	Huk pacha kuskan.
He’ll be here now.	Payqa kunan kaypi kanqa.
It’s working there, though.	Chaypin ichaqa llank’ashan.
So that’s what you do.	Chaymi chayta ruwanki.
If so, we should apply what he says.	Chayna kaptinqa chayna nisqanman hinam ruwananchik.
In fact, he’s anything but.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa imapas ichaqa.
You know, adults are so foolish.	Yachanki, kuraq runakunaqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He can make him.	Paymi payta ruwanman.
They learn very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam yachanku.
But it seems like it should be.	Ichaqa chayna kanan hinam.

So, pretty much everything about it.	Chaymi, yaqa tukuy ima chaymanta.
That’s what it does.	Chaynatam ruwan.
Many wicked people in the world.	Achka millay runakuna kay pachapi.
But we disagree.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu kayku.
It goes right away.	Chaylla rin.
In fact, you may be doing it a great disservice.	Chiqaptaqa ichapas hatun mana allinta ruwachkanki.
I intend to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykuni.
Older than you.	Qammanta aswan kuraq.
So thank you very much for that.	Chaymi anchata gracias chaymanta.
Almost as good as new.	Yaqa musuq hina allin.
But he probably didn't.	Ichaqa manapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I knew it would be there.	Yacharqanim chaypi kananta.
He can’t do that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
So, it took a while.	Chaymi, huk rato pasarqa.
But it's probably not worth it.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana valenchu.
That’s me and you.	Chayqa ñuqapas qampas.
And the head.	Hinaspa uma.
I’ll do that for you.	Chayta ruwasaq qampaq.
That’s the person talking.	Chayqa runam rimachkan.
He does it better.	Paymi aswan allinta ruwan.
I don’t think you can stand it long.	Mana unaytachu aguantayta atisqaykita yuyaykuni.
Here’s a letter from him.	Kaypi huk cartata paymanta.
I didn’t want to be sober.	Manam munarqanichu allin yuyayniyuq kayta.
But it was much bigger.	Ichaqa aswan hatunmi karqan.
He could never succeed.	Manan hayk’aqpas allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
What a great achievement.	Ima hatun ruwaymi.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Seguro kani allinmi kanqa.
A year smarter.	Huk wata aswan yachaysapa.
It’s not just me, it’s just me, it’s just me.	Manam ñuqallachu, ñuqallachu, ñuqallachu.
He didn’t notice them.	Payqa manan chaykunataqa repararqanchu.
I couldn’t have done that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu karqa.
This is by no means certain.	Kayqa manan imapipas segurochu.
Instead, he said.	Aswanpas nirqanmi.
But nowhere is this true.	Ichaqa manan maypipas kayqa cheqaqchu.
This doesn't seem too bad.	Kayqa manam ancha mana allinchu rikchakun.
I had to be serious.	Serio kanay karqa.
I was serious.	Serio karqani.
And so, much richer.	Hinaspa chayna, ancha aswan qhapaq.
I’m hungrier than ever.	Aswan yarqasqa kani.
There is no man.	Runaqa manam kanchu.
When did he do it.	Hayk'aqmi ruwarqan.
That has always been the case.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
He obviously didn’t.	Payqa sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
You are always right on time with me.	Sapa kutim ñuqawanqa tiempopi allinta kanki.
He did somewhat well.	Payqa huk chhikantan allinta ruwarqan.
If this evening.	Sichus kunan ch’isi.
I didn’t do that at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
I really wanted to buy it.	Anchatam rantiyta munarqani.
This seems to be the least active.	Kayqa aswan pisi ruwaq hinam.
It’s actually really bad.	Chiqaptaqa chiqap mana allinmi.
You want to be happy with him.	Paywan kaspa kusisqa kaytam munanki.
It was something like him.	Pay hina imapas karqa.
But you were always disappointed.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi hukmanyasqa karqanki.
She was excited to go to school with him.	Payqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan paywan kuska escuelaman rinanpaq.
Now go,’ he says.	Kunanqa riy’, nispas nin.
I mean, it’s overwhelming to be there.	Niyta munani, chaypi kayqa sinchi hatunmi.
He couldn’t understand why.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imarayku chayta.
No one wants to get hurt themselves.	Manan pipas munanchu kikin k’irisqa kananta.
He does what he wants.	Munasqanman hinam ruwan.
What do you want! 	Imatataq munanki!
Now go, go, go.	Kunanqa riy, riy.
Stop being unreasonable.	Amaña mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
But you know, you really have to.	Ichaqa yachanki, cheqaqtapunin ruwanayki.
You’re going to be sad.	Llakisqa kanki.
In about two weeks.	Iskay semanapi hina.
But then things started happening.	Ichaqa chaymantam imapas pasananta qallaykurqa.
It was a few hours ago now.	Kunanqa iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
That was the truth.	Chay cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Goodness, he meant.	Allin kay, niyta munarqa.
You’re the only one.	Qamllam kachkanki.
I hope you do this and succeed.	Suyachkani kayta ruwanaykipaq hinaspa allinta ruwanaykipaq.
I think it would have been wrong.	Yuyaykuni mana allinchu kanman karqan.
We’re busy.	Ocupasqa kayku.
This is extremely uncertain.	Kayqa sinchi mana segurochu.
No, he was hungry.	Manan, yarqaymanta kasharqan.
I am with him all day.	Tukuy punchawmi paywan kachkani.
I feel like that’s the way it is.	Chayna hinam tarikuni.
It’s the same as before.	Ñawpaq hinam.
But perhaps he took them a little too seriously.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaykunataqa huk chhikanta nishuta allinta hap’irqan.
He will always succeed.	Payqa sapa kutim allinta ruwanqa.
He has to go home soon.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan wasiyman rinan.
I couldn’t understand it.	Manam chaytaqa entiendeyta atirqanichu.
Who could have been himself.	Pitaq pay kikin kanman karqan.
I like it now.	Kunanqa gustanmi.
He had never looked intently there.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypiqa allintachu qhawarisqa.
I know I have some not-so-pretty looks to do.	Yachanim wakin mana ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq kayta ruwanaypaq.
However, it was better than nothing.	Ichaqa, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi karqa.
That’s the name of it.	Chayna sutinmi.
This plays a major role.	Kaymi hatun ruwayta ruwan.
Two people, actually.	Iskay runakuna, chiqaptaqa.
These turned out great.	Kaykunaqa ancha allinmi lluqsirqa.
I've been out here all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kay hawapi kachkani.
After that, he lost track of her.	Chay qhepamanmi manaña paytaqa repararqanchu.
Then it’s right or wrong.	Chaymantaqa allinmi icha manachu.
How can this man be so evil.	¿Imaynataq kay runa chayna millay kanman.
It was crazy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa loco hinam karqa.
I didn’t expect anything.	Manam imatapas suyarqanichu.
It just can't work.	Chaylla mana llamk'ayta atinchu.
You’re not doing it right.	Manam allintachu ruwanki.
Here’s what he’s talking about.	Kaypim rimachkan.
I still have a lot to do.	Kunankamapas achkatam ruwanay kachkan.
Same time every day.	Sapa punchaw kikin pacha.
Instead of .	Chaymantaqa .
And this can be very difficult.	Hinaspa kayqa ancha sasa kanman.
You, more than anything.	Qam, imamantapas aswan achka.
Therefore, he cannot speak.	Chayraykum mana rimayta atinchu.
You are beautiful, as always.	Sumaqmi kanki, sapa kuti hina.
I have no idea where it is.	Manam maypi kasqanmanta yuyayniyuqchu kani.
I’m not here for that.	Manam chaymantaqa kaypichu kachkani.
He knows how to do it.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwayta.
It seems like a long time ago.	Unayñam rikchakun.
One was human, perhaps the last.	Hukninmi karqan runa, yaqapaschá qhepa kaq.
But, you know.	Ichaqa, yachanki.
This was obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
It seemed so absurd.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi rikchakurqa.
The teacher is no longer.	Yachachiq manaña.
Do whatever you want with me.	Ñoqawan ima munasqaykita ruway.
Seriously, like nothing else.	Serio, mana imapas hina.
And this makes sense.	Hinaspa kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
Here, we made one.	Kaypi, hukta ruwarqayku.
But he’s pretty smart.	Ichaqa allin yachaysapa.
But it’s not that difficult.	Ichaqa manan chay hina sasachu.
Here’s a little bit about me.	Kaypi huk chikan ñuqamanta kachkan.
Things would be easier.	Imapas aswan facilmi kanman.
He eats something.	Imatapas mikun.
We are fine here.	Kaypiqa allinmi kachkaniku.
Something I never owned.	Imapas mana haykapipas ñuqapa kaq.
That’s it, it’s not.	Chayqa, manañam.
Maybe it’s hidden.	Ichapas pakasqa kanman.
Okay, he was human.	Allinmi, payqa runam karqa.
So it’s pretty crazy.	Chaymi ancha loco.
I am, in fact, just like you.	Ñuqapas, chiqaptaqa, qam hinam kani.
But there was no later.	Ichaqa manan karqanchu qhepaman.
It doesn’t matter if you do this.	Kayta ruwayqa manam imananpaschu.
That shouldn’t be too difficult.	Chayqa manan sinchi sasachu kanan.
It didn’t matter if he was innocent or guilty.	Manam imananpaschu karqa mana huchayoq kaptinpas huchayoq kaptinpas.
But first, it was a process.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa huk ruwaymi karqan.
Now it seems very real that something is wrong.	Kunanqa ancha chiqap hinam imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe you learn a new language or something.	Ichapas huk musuq simita utaq imatapas yachanki.
They are beautiful though.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi ichaqa.
He came to my house first.	Paymi ñawpaqta wasiyman hamurqan.
Insurance is important.	Seguro nisqa ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
Tom was excellent.	Tomqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He always talked about who was to blame.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi rimaq pichus huchayoq kasqanmanta.
No one can do everything.	Manan pipas tukuyta ruwayta atinmanchu.
Obviously, both would be wrong.	Sut’inmi, iskayninku mana allinchu kanman.
And then I’d be young.	Hinaspa chaymanta wayna kayman.
All day and all night.	Tukuy punchaw hinaspa tukuy tuta.
Today should be easy.	Kunan punchawqa facilmi kanan.
He wasn’t there yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chaypichu kasqa.
Please let me know if this is useful.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway sichus kayqa allin kanman chayqa.
And here it is again.	Hinaspa kaypi yapamanta.
So, it’s harder.	Chaymi, aswan sasa.
But, of course, that’s just not going to work.	Ichaqa, chiqamanta, chaylla mana allinchu kanqa.
Most of the time you are.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna kanki.
I could have a story, if I wanted to.	Huk willakuyta hap’iyta atiyman, munaspaqa.
Unlike regular people.	Mana sapa kuti runakuna hinachu.
I won’t be all day.	Manam tukuy punchawchu kasaq.
That came earlier.	Chayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi hamurqa.
There was something he had to do.	Chaypim ima ruwanan karqa.
One of them has a bad attitude.	Hukninmi mana allin yuyayniyuq.
Maybe maybe maybe.	Ichapas ichapas ichapas.
He took them very seriously.	Chaykunataqa anchatan allinta qhawarirqan.
Yes, they know everything here.	Arí, kaypi tukuy imata yachanku.
Tell me what you’re about.	Willaway imamanta kasqaykita.
So far I am happy here.	Kunankamaqa kaypim kusisqa kachkani.
Beautiful, beautiful!' 	¡Sumaq, sumaq!’, nispa.
He wants the food.	Payqa chay mikhunata munan.
She knew he was drunk.	Payqa yacharqanmi machasqa kashasqanmanta.
But no one can do it.	Ichaqa manan pipas atinmanchu.
Proud of him.	Paymanta orgulloso.
Timing is important.	Allin tiempopi ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
But here, it’s cold.	Ichaqa kaypi, chiri.
But it’s very good.	Ichaqa ancha allin.
I found out late one night.	Huk tutan tardeta chayta yacharqani.
I knew he could.	Yacharqanim atisqanmanta.
Angry himself, he did.	Kikin phiñasqa, chaytan ruwarqan.
In fact, it’s.	Chiqaptaqa.
This is actually easy.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa facilmi.
So he went all afternoon, .	Chaymi tukuy tarde rirqa, .
No one is alone.	Manan pipas sapallanchu.
That wasn’t true though.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan ichaqa.
It is available here.	Kaypi tarikun.
Talking to him is not easy.	Paywan rimayqa manan facilchu.
I am older than you.	Ñuqaqa qammanta aswan kuraq kani.
I could never understand it.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa entiendeyta atirqanichu.
I've always been like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqani.
I mean really, really sick.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta unqusqa niyta munani.
He’s mine again.	Payqa yapamanta ñuqapa.
But this may not be the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
The most beautiful thing.	Aswan sumaq kaq.
I don't feel good about this.	Kaymantaqa manam allintachu sientekuni.
Unlike her, he wasn't so sure.	Payqa manan pay hinachu karqan, manan chhayna segurochu karqan.
If so, it would be good.	Chayna kaptinqa allinmi kanman.
I didn’t know about this.	Manam kaymanta yacharqanichu.
Soon it could be tomorrow.	Pisi tiempollamantan paqarin kanman.
He wanted nothing more than that.	Payqa manan imatapas munarqanchu aswanpas chaymantaqa.
They weren’t funny.	Paykunaqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqanku.
He wanted to eat and walk.	Mikhuyta, puriyta ima munarqa.
He said once a week.	Semanapi huk kutitam nirqa.
I would be very sad to be	Sinchi llakisqa kayman kay .
This statement is not true.	Kay nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu.
So no one is alone.	Chaymi mana pipas sapallanchu.
He could sleep in tomorrow.	Payqa paqarinmi puñuyta atinman karqan.
I heard it loudly.	Sinchitan uyarirqani.
It’s great to seem unafraid.	Mana mancharisqa hina kayqa hatunmi.
Do something tomorrow.	Paqarin imatapas ruway.
He is doing his best.	Payqa tukuy atisqanman hinan ruwashan.
I’ll be fine though.	Allinmi kasaq ichaqa.
I mean, this morning.	Niyta munani, kunan paqarin.
I can’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atiymanchu.
But the process was not so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan chay ruwayqa.
What, not anyone.	Ima, mana pi.
Good or bad.	Allin utaq mana allin.
I really have no idea.	Chiqaptaqa manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani.
But it’s not like this, no.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu, manan.
Isn’t that all that matters?.	¿Manachu chaylla importante?.
He realized something was wrong.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas mana allin kasqanta.
It was so much better.	Ancha aswan allinmi karqa.
I’m fast, but not like him.	Ñoqaqa usqhayllan kani, ichaqa manan pay hinachu.
If you ever want to.	Sichus hayk'aqllapas munanki chayqa.
Everything was, like, set up.	Tukuy imapas karqa, imayna, churasqa.
That was pretty amazing about it.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa chaymanta.
You be there, now.	Qamqa chaypi kay, kunanqa.
It looked bad, alright .	Mana allinmi rikchakurqa, allinmi .
So maybe you’ll have him next year.	Chaymi ichapas hamuq wata paywan kanki.
They were insane.	Paykunaqa loco karqanku.
But unlike many others.	Ichaqa manan askha runakuna hinachu.
Nothing about being tough.	Mana imapas sinchi kaymanta.
But it could very well be true.	Ichaqa ancha allintan cheqaq kanman.
I didn’t know how to walk.	Manam puriyta yacharqanichu.
I never thought much about it.	Manam haykapipas anchatachu chaymantaqa piensarqani.
I never want to be like that.	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munanichu.
Otherwise, don’t do anything.	Mana chayqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
He realized how good he was with her.	Payqa repararqanmi paywan ancha allin kasqanta.
He loves to play.	Payqa anchatam munan pukllayta.
Go home in the afternoon.	Wasiman tardeta riy.
You cannot understand him.	Paytaqa manam entiendeyta atiwaqchu.
There was nothing I could have done.	Manam ima ruwaytapas atiymanchu karqa.
You know what I mean? 	Yachankichu imata niyta munani?
No one is like that.	Manan pipas chay hinachu.
That’s it for me.	Chayqa ñuqapaq.
Can’t wait to hear it.	Mana suyayta atinchu uyariyta.
And that’s where everything came out.	Hinaspa chaypi tukuy imapas lluqsirqa.
I mean all day long.	Tukuy punchaw niyta munani.
Smarter, more mysterious.	Aswan yachaysapa, aswan pakasqa.
Okay, that sounds good.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi uyarikun.
But it was unfortunate.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi karqan.
I’m not sure what year it was.	Manam allintachu yachani ima wata kasqanmanta.
Maybe I don't get it right.	Ichapas mana allintachu hapini.
That sounds good, but it won’t work.	Chayqa allinmi uyarikun, ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
It had been a very long time.	Ancha unayñan kasqa.
Please let me know you are okay.	Ama hina kaspa, allin kasqaykita willaway.
He couldn’t wait to get home.	Payqa manan suyayta atirqanchu wasinman chayayta.
He was very childlike.	Payqa ancha wawa hinam karqa.
And therein lies the secret.	Hinaspa chaypim kachkan pakasqa kaq.
I have, a couple of times.	Ñuqaqa kanmi, huk iskay kutita.
This is of no use now.	Kunanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kayqa.
He is a wise and intelligent man.	Payqa yachaysapa, yachaysapa runam.
I couldn’t be alone.	Manam sapallay kayta atirqanichu.
These activities .	Kay ruwaykunata .
I have always been me.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñoqaqa karqani.
He can’t let that happen.	Mana chay pasananta atinchu.
Now he said it all the time.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempon chayta nisqa.
I don't really like this.	Kayqa manam anchatachu gustan.
Which is the easiest way to do that.	Imataq aswan facil chayta ruwanapaq.
But not in a car together, now.	Ichaqa manan huk carropi kuskachu, kunanqa.
Anywhere, it doesn’t matter.	Maypipas, manam imananpaschu.
What’s the answer to that? 	¿Imataq chaymanta?
He realized he had no choice.	Payqa repararqanmi mana ima ruwaytapas atisqanmanta.
Most certainly, and .	Astawan seguro, hinaspa .
I like doing it outside.	Hawapi ruwayta gustan.
Now, not everyone agrees, and that’s okay.	Kunanqa, manan llapa runachu chaywanqa acuerdopi kashanku, chayqa allinmi.
This is how it came about.	Kay hinam hamurqa.
I am a lonely person.	Ñuqaqa sapallay runam kani.
Go anywhere, anywhere, late.	Maymanpas, maymanpas, tardeta riy.
I may not be happy about it.	Manapaschá chaymantaqa kusisqachu kasaq.
But there was still nothing.	Ichaqa hinallam mana imapas karqachu.
Doing it right is not difficult.	Allinta ruwayqa manan sasachu.
I saw him there.	Chaypim paytaqa rikurqani.
Something like that, he thinks.	Imapas chayna, nispas yuyaykun.
Anything less than that.	Imapas aswan pisi kaq.
There were many evictions.	Chaypin askha runakuna qarqosqa karqanku.
But then, he was there.	Ichaqa chaymanta, payqa chaypi kasqa.
Here, in this house, here we are.	Kaypi, kay wasipi, kaypi kanchik.
But this is not true at all.	Ichaqa kayqa manan cheqaqchu ni imapipas.
What wasn’t right.	Imataq mana allinchu karqa.
Preferably in a hospital.	Aswan allinmi huk hospitalpi.
It was a wonderful experience here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi pasarqa.
He should be in jail.	Paymi carcelpi kanan.
That’s what it says.	Chayqa ninmi.
It’s not easy.	Mana facilchu.
This was a difficult one.	Kayqa sasam karqa.
I hope to talk soon.	Suyachkani chaylla rimayta.
But you can’t be human now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa runa kayta atiwaqchu.
Maybe it’s not easy.	Ichapas mana facilchu kanman.
He was always alone.	Payqa sapa kutim sapallan karqa.
He had no intention of answering it.	Payqa manan chayta kutichiyta yuyaykurqanchu.
He had to go alone.	Payqa sapallanmi rinan karqa.
Almost everything that could go wrong, went wrong.	Yaqa tukuy imapas mana allintachu rinanpaq, mana allintachu rirqa.
Not to do with you.	Mana qamwan ruwanapaq.
It has always been so.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna karqan.
Man, he’s amazing.	Runa, payqa admirakuypaqmi.
That’s what people want.	Chaytan runakunaqa munanku.
I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.	Unqusqa hinaspa sayk’usqa karqani unqusqa hinaspa sayk’usqa kasqaymanta.
You’re just that.	Chayllaraqmi kanki.
Okay, so I wasn’t the only one.	Allinmi, chaymi mana ñuqallachu karqani.
Do it a lot.	Anchata ruway.
We did some great things out there.	Chay hawapi wakin hatun ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
But I’ll probably go.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá risaq.
I do it there.	Chaypim ruwani.
No one wants anything to do with you.	Manan pipas munanchu qanwan ima ruwaytapas.
But no one can do it.	Ichaqa manan pipas ruwayta atinmanchu.
Now you want to talk.	Kunanqa rimayta munanki.
That is a very sad thing.	Chayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi.
He is not like other people.	Payqa manan huk runakuna hinachu.
He was, himself.	Payqa karqan, pay kikin.
You can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Being a human being.	Huk runa kay.
All for the best, but it was amazing.	Tukuy ima allinpaq, ichaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
This is not true at all.	Kayqa manan cheqaqchu ni imapipas.
Of course, it’s much better there now.	Arí, kunanqa aswan allintan chaypiqa kashan.
That’s what I had to do.	Chaytan ruwanay karqan.
He was a very lonely man.	Payqa ancha sapallan runam karqa.
She said, what do you want.	Payqa nisqa, imatataq munanki.
It probably sounds too good to be true.	Yaqapaschá ancha allin uyarikun.
Sure, now.	Seguro, sasa.
What should he do now.	Imatataq kunan ruwanan.
But now you know better.	Ichaqa kunanmi aswan allinta yachanki.
I can't wait here.	Kaypiqa manam suyayta atiymanchu.
No one wants to go first.	Manan pipas ñawpaqtaqa riyta munanchu.
It’s really for the better.	Chiqaptam allinpaq.
Not well, at least.	Mana allintachu, aswanpas.
They were all busy.	Llapallankum mana ocupasqa karqaku.
But I like it that way.	Ichaqa chaynatam gustan.
This is an important step in the process.	Kayqa ancha allinmi chay ruwaypi.
He never said he did.	Mana hayk’aqpas nirqanchu chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I tried to speak with it.	Chaywanmi rimanaypaq kallpanchakurqani.
I am also very quick.	Ñuqapas ancha utqayllam kani.
Seriously, these never.	Serio, kaykunaqa mana hayk’aqpas.
But don’t learn to do that.	Ichaqa ama chayta ruwayta yachankichu.
This guy was a guy.	Kay runaqa kasqa.
No one thought anyone would ever come here.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu kayman hayk’aqllapas pipas hamunanta.
Perhaps, he is gone now.	Ichapas, kunanqa manaña kanchu.
It will be better.	Aswan allinqa kanqa.
There he wanted to ask something.	Chaypim imapas tapuyta munarqa.
He was obviously ready to leave.	Payqa sut’inmi ripunanpaq listoña kasharqan.
I know what needs to be done.	Yachanim ima ruwana kasqanmanta.
Now, this week, this month, this year.	Kunan, kay semana, kay killa, kay wata.
He already knows what’s going on.	Ñam yachan imapas kasqanmanta.
I am very sorry now.	Kunanqa anchatam llakikuni.
I still live there today.	Kunankamapas chaypim yachani.
Please what can go wrong.	Ama hina kaspa imataq mana allin kanman.
The first one is just that.	Ñawpaq kaqmi chaylla.
And immediately scared.	Hinaspa chaylla mancharisqa.
I mean swimming in it.	Chaypi nadayta niyta munani.
Actually, that’s amazing.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
Otherwise, this is a nice set up.	Mana chayqa, kayqa sumaq churasqa.
It’s not exactly that.	Manam allintachu chayna.
Before humanity.	Runa kaymanta ñawpaqtaraqmi.
The day went badly.	Chay punchawqa mana allintam rirqa.
However, this may not always be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
I have always wanted to do something.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
It was still not good enough.	Hinallam mana allinchu karqa.
He realized it was night.	Payqa repararqanmi tuta kasqanmanta.
No way to do it.	Mana imayna ruwanapaq.
He was the first to do so.	Chaypaqqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
Yes, it is very beautiful.	Arí, ancha sumaqmi.
But you don’t want to be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypi kayta munankichu.
He knows exactly what he is going to do.	Allintam yachan ima ruwananta.
The truth is the last thing they want to hear.	Cheqaq kaqmi qhepa kaq uyariyta munanku.
It is of no value to you.	Manam imapaqpas valenchu ​​qampaq.
Maybe they don't really know what's out there.	Ichapas mana chiqaptachu yachanku imakuna huk hawapi kasqanmanta.
But he’s a pretty good player.	Ichaqa payqa allin allin pukllaqmi.
Someone with a sense of humor.	Pipas yuyayniyuq.
On top of all that stuff.	Tukuy chay imakuna hawapi.
So it was a really nice time.	Chaymi chiqap sumaq tiempo karqa.
I was really stupid.	Chiqaptam sonso karqani.
He was not alone in this.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kaypi karqa.
That meant tonight.	Chayqa kunan tuta niyta munarqa.
This will tell you what the problem is.	Chaywanmi yachanki ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
But it’s good, he thinks.	Ichaqa allinmi, nispas yuyaykun.
So I couldn’t help it.	Chayraykum mana yanapayta atirqanichu.
It’s not good yet, but it’s better.	Manaraqmi allinchu, ichaqa aswan allinmi.
He didn’t do the actual singing, though.	Payqa manan ruwarqanchu cheqaq takiyta, ichaqa.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Ichapas kayqa hatun imapas kanman.
I'm sorry, go ahead.	Pampachaykuway, riy.
This approach sounds confusing.	Kay ruwayqa pantasqa hinam uyarikun.
If you don’t know what it is, you should.	Mana yachankichu ima kasqanmanta chayqa, chaytan ruwanayki.
Guilty, that was it.	Huchayoq, chaymi karqan.
In fact, they are both there twice.	Aswanpas iskayninkun iskay kutita chaypi kashanku.
My time, do that.	Tiempoy, chayta ruway.
This didn’t exist ten years ago.	Kayqa chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa manas karqachu.
It could be worse than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
It was the best thing ever.	Chayqa karqan aswan allin kaqmi.
That is certainly difficult.	Cheqaqtapunin chayqa sasa.
Anything in the world.	Kay pachapi imapas.
So far he seemed innocent.	Kunankamaqa mana huchayoq hinam karqa.
Something caught in time.	Tiempopi hap’isqa imapas.
You don’t want to see it.	Mana rikuyta munankichu.
Don’t pretend it is.	Ama chayna kasqanta hina ruwaychu.
He’s always, always good.	Payqa sapa kuti, sapa kuti allin.
Yes, it does.	Arí, chaytam ruwan.
And there it was.	Hinaspa chaypiqa karqan.
He always agreed with her.	Payqa sapa kutim paywan acuerdopi karqa.
Who wants to do that?.	¿Pitaq chayta ruwayta munan?.
Perhaps he had the right idea.	Yaqapaschá payqa allinta yuyaykurqan.
You said it in the funniest way possible.	Aswan asikunapaq hinam nirqanki.
So he can’t do that.	Chaymi payqa mana chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
It’s very lonely here.	Kaypiqa ancha sapallanmi tarikun.
He was such a man.	Payqa chayna runam karqa.
No one could agree.	Manan pipas acuerdopi kayta atirqanchu.
I think black would be better.	Yuyaykuni yana aswan allin kanman.
He didn’t want another win.	Payqa manan huk atipayta munarqanchu.
He knows there is no one here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi mana pipas kasqanmanta.
I am very proud to be a part of it.	Anchatam orgulloso kani chaypi kasqaymanta.
You’ve always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqanki.
In fact, maybe it should for all reasons.	Chiqamanta, ichapas tukuy imarayku chayna kanan tiyan.
I didn’t hear anything.	Mana imatapas uyarirqanichu.
It was the cold hard truth.	Chayqa karqan chiri sinchi cheqaq kaq.
He is a very lonely man.	Payqa ancha sapallan runam.
You are the third one.	Qamqa kimsa kaqmi kanki.
What’s wrong with me? 	¿Imataq ñuqawan kachkan?
He didn’t tell me that, someone else did.	Payqa manan chaytachu niwarqan, huk runan niwarqan.
They seemed disappointed.	Paykunaqa hukmanyasqa hinam karqaku.
I don't agree that this is always right.	Manam acuerdopichu kani sapa kuti kayna allin kasqanmanta.
Very clever, indeed.	Ancha yachaysapa, chiqaptapuni.
But that would be better.	Ichaqa chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
Something didn't seem right.	Imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I’m just not very good at it.	Chaylla mana ancha allinchu kani chaypi.
I did everything alone.	Sapallanmi tukuy imatapas ruwarqani.
He acted like he did it every day.	Payqa sapa p’unchaymi chayta ruwan hinata ruwarqan.
And this is .	Hinaspa kayqa .
And it took a while.	Hinaspa huk rato pasarqa.
I mean, yeah, they are.	Niyta munani, arí, paykunaqa kanku.
He’s a good idea.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I never would have been able to.	Manam haykapipas atiymanchu karqa.
I really wanted that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munarqani.
I’m doing all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruwachkani.
Now that’s going to be a big deal.	Kunanqa chayqa hatun ruwaymi kanqa.
He didn’t think much of it.	Payqa manan anchatachu chaypi yuyaykurqan.
He had no idea about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamantapas mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Obviously, that will be better this month.	Sut’inmi, chayqa kay killapi aswan allin kanqa.
Maybe, once upon a time, they were people.	Ichapas, huk kutipi, paykunaqa runakuna karqaku.
But there is no such person.	Ichaqa manan chhayna runaqa kanchu.
That statement is not true.	Chay rimayqa manan cheqaqchu.
He couldn't tell.	Payqa manam willayta atirqachu.
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa unayñan chayqa karqan.
So, it’s so confusing.	Chaymi, chayna pantasqa.
Here is the truth.	Kaypim chiqap kaq kachkan.
That, it seems, is yes.	Chayqa, arí hinam.
We agree quite a bit.	Allintam acuerdopi kayku.
The most popular nightclub in town.	Llaqtapi aswan riqsisqa tuta wasi.
He said he felt alone here.	Kaypi sapallan sientekusqanmanta nirqa.
But that is not certain.	Ichaqa manan chayqa segurochu.
It was like a school coming to your school.	Chayqa karqan huk yachay wasiykiman hamuq hina.
Anywhere is better than here.	Maypipas aswan allinmi kaymantaqa.
Some very so.	Wakin ancha chayna.
That one thing I am.	Chay huk kaqmi ñoqaqa kani.
It was very nice but cold.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa ichaqa chiri.
Tell them all about it.	Tukuy chayta willay.
Really, too many.	Chiqamanta, ancha achka.
A stranger, a nice man, but a real man.	Huk mana riqsisqa runa, sumaq runa, ichaqa chiqap runa.
How are you, what have you done?.	Imaynataq kachkanki, imatataq ruwarqanki?.
I don't really know how he did it.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imaynatam chayta ruwasqanmanta.
First, know what you need to do.	Ñawpaqtaqa yachay imatachus ruwanaykita.
The truth is more important.	Cheqaq kaqmi aswan importante.
It’s a cold morning.	Chiri paqarinmi.
This stuff is great.	Kay imapas ancha allinmi.
I am very, very happy.	Ñuqaqa ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I wanted to be the last one.	Qhipa kaq kaytam munarqani.
You can do that if you want.	Munaspaqa chaynatam ruwawaq.
But that was .	Ichaqa chayqa karqan .
They were there immediately.	Chayllam chaypi karqaku.
But it seemed to be the case.	Ichaqa chayna kanan hinam karqa.
It wasn’t there or anything.	Manam karqachu nitaq imapas.
He was furious with her, after all.	Payqa sinchitan phiñasqa paywan, tukuy imamanta.
He was very worried about her, she said.	Payqa anchatam llakisqa paymanta, nispas nin.
It was as simple as it could be.	Chayqa atisqanman hina facilmi karqa.
There would always be something about him.	Chaypiqa sapa kutim imapas paymanta kanman.
Then you will have to do better.	Chaymantaqa astawan allinta ruwanayki kanqa.
Very, very lonely.	Ancha, ancha sapallan.
Now he has a good sense of humor.	Kunanqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
I’m here in the same way.	Ñuqapas chaynatam kaypi kachkani.
This is like a real haunted house.	Kayqa chiqap mancharisqa wasi hinam.
To do it right.	Allinta ruwanapaq.
I don’t know where to go.	Manam yachanichu mayman riyta.
This was the first step.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq kaq ruway.
He will be something more, something beyond that.	Payqa kanqa imapas aswan, imapas chaymanta aswan.
That's almost likely.	Chayqa yaqapaschá yaqapaschá kanman.
It’s not always good.	Manam sapa kutichu allin.
I'm doing fine thank you.	Allintam ruwachkani gracias.
Take a swim.	Huk nadayta ruway.
Please let me know.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway.
He was almost twice as big.	Payqa yaqa iskay kuti hatunmi karqa.
And he would do it again, he said.	Hinaspa hukmanta ruwanman karqan, nispas nin.
But it wasn’t like it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
A lot of people were really there.	Achka runakunam chiqaptapuni chaypi karqaku.
I think you can do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwawaq.
Somewhere, said the man.	Maypipas, nispas nin chay runaqa.
I disagree with you about everything.	Tukuy imamanta mana acuerdopichu kani qamwan.
But last night it looked like that.	Ichaqa qayna tutam chayna rikchakurqa.
Yes, it is ridiculous.	Arí, asikunapaq hinam.
This statement is very important to me.	Kay rimayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
Sick day.	Unqusqa punchaw.
This is all good stuff.	Kay tukuy imapas allinmi.
He started talking again.	Hukmanta rimayta qallaykurqa.
I think it might be.	Yuyaykuni chayna kanman.
Okay, you can do this.	Allinmi, kaytam ruwawaq.
I want to talk to you.	Qanwan rimayta munani.
I'm not sure if that would be better.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chay aswan allin kanman chayta.
You really don't want to do this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta ruwayta munankichu.
What a good day it is.	Ima punchawmi allin.
One of them will have to do it.	Hukninmi chayta ruwanan kanqa.
Second, they are irrational.	Iskay kaq, mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
He couldn’t be more upset.	Payqa manan aswan llakisqa kayta atirqanchu.
It’s hard to eat at home for that.	Chaypaqqa wasipi mikhuy sasa.
But that’s what’s going to happen.	Ichaqa chaymi kanqa.
Later that evening.	Chay ch’isi qhepamanmi.
However, they are not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu kanku.
Then he has to be alone.	Chaymantaqa sapallan kanan tiyan.
There are many at that time.	Chay pacha achka.
About a month or so.	Yaqa huk killa hinam.
It was like a married couple.	Chayqa karqa casarasqa hinam.
You want something more.	Astawan imatapas munanki.
This is a great guy.	Kayqa hatun runam.
Maybe he was alone here.	Ichapas kaypi sapallan karqa.
I think about college.	Colegiopi yuyaykuni.
Please tell me what to do.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway imata ruwanaypaq.
Yes, he said.	Arí nispa.
She was beautiful, for sure.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, seguro.
He would be a player.	Payqa pukllaqmi kanman.
And it’s almost there.	Hinaspa yaqa chaypi kachkan.
But it almost never worked out.	Ichaqa yaqa mana hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
You want to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwayta munanki.
Everything will come soon.	Tukuy imapas chaylla hamunqa.
But it’s hard.	Ichaqa sasam.
But it would be very useful.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
He got all excited about it.	Payqa chaymanta tukuy kusisqa tarikurqa.
He knows there is nowhere for him now.	Payqa yachanmi kunanqa manaña maypipas paypaq kasqanmanta.
You’re alone in yourself.	Sapallanmi kanki.
He must be pretty drunk, though.	Payqa sumaq machasqa kanan, ichaqa.
That’s not to say it’s wrong.	Chayqa manan pantasqa kananpaqchu.
It’s so amazing! 	¡Ancha admirakuypaqmi!
I don't know what you really want to do.	Manam yachanichu imatam chiqaptapuni ruwayta munanki.
He knew it would be the last.	Payqa yacharqanmi qhepa kaq kananta.
Okay, maybe .	Allinmi, ichapas .
We’re here together.	Kuska kaypi kanchik.
He knew he was there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kasqanmanta.
We did things right.	Allintam imatapas ruwarqayku.
Someone, something else was here.	Pipas, huk imapas kaypi karqa.
The latter of these.	Chay qhipa kaq.
Not happy, either.	Mana kusisqachu, nitaq.
I really want to convince one.	Chiqaptam hukta convencechiyta munani.
It just has to be.	Chayllam kanan.
There was nothing all that time.	Chay tukuy tiempopiqa manan imapas karqanchu.
So do it right away.	Chaymi chaylla ruway.
He is ready to be that way.	Payqa chhayna kananpaqmi listo kashan.
You have to do it really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwanayki tiyan.
So please say why that might be.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa niy imarayku chayna kanman chayta.
Or this evening.	Utaq kunan ch’isi.
You wouldn’t want that, would you?.	Manam chaytaqa munawaqchu, ¿aw?.
Otherwise it can really go make one.	Mana chayqa chiqaptam riyta atinman hukta ruway.
Sure you did that.	Seguro chayta ruwarqanki.
I want to catch that.	Chayta hapiyta munani.
I didn’t know how long it would take.	Manam yacharqanichu hayka tiempo pasananta.
That’s pretty much what it says.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayta nin.
I need them soon.	Chaykunataqa usqhayllan necesitasaq.
I couldn't do that before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
It's not all that bad, anyway.	Manam tukuy chay mana allinchu, imayna kaptinpas.
He asked me the right question.	Payqa allintam tapuwarqa.
I saw him this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi paytaqa rikurqani.
It probably doesn’t make sense.	Yaqapaschá mana imapaqpas valenchu.
They are second and third.	Iskay kaq, kimsa kaq ima kanku.
I was a great player.	Hatun pukllaqmi karqani.
A lot of me.	Achka ñuqamanta.
Obviously I've done it again.	Sut'inmi hukmanta ruwarqani.
It was the most unreal thing.	Chayqa aswan mana cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
It was like, you know, like .	Chayqa karqan hina, yachanki, hina .
The truth was he wasn't sure he was going to be good.	Chiqap kaqmi karqa payqa manam segurochu karqa allin kananta.
Maybe the world.	Ichapas kay pacha.
But it may not be true.	Ichaqa manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
Often this .	Sapa kutim kay .
And that meant it.	Hinaspa chay niyta munarqa.
He was never alone here.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallan kaypi karqanchu.
Seriously, that's what he said.	Serio, chaytam nirqa.
Proceed to the next step.	Qatiqnin ruwayman riy.
I am really afraid to drive this car.	Chiqaptam manchakuni kay carrota manejayta.
These are great things.	Kaykunaqa hatunmi.
It's kind of reluctant.	Chayqa imayna mana munasqanman hinam.
He was there, but he wasn't there.	Payqa chaypim karqa, ichaqa manam chaypichu karqa.
He couldn't be ready for her, not yet.	Payqa manan paypaq listo kayta atirqanchu, manaraqmi.
I mean, the world.	Niyta munani, kay pacha.
He is one of the best.	Payqa huknin allin runam.
No, he was angry.	Manan, payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
It always worked out.	Sapa kutim allinta lluqsirqa.
Every action is important.	Sapa ruwaymi importante.
This is not such a big deal.	Kayqa manam chayna hatun ruwaychu.
Someone wants to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwayta munan.
I can’t figure out how to get here.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imaynata kayman rinaypaq.
He was a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runan karqan.
I feel like I want to.	Munaymanmi sientekuni.
That night to the house.	Chay tuta wasiman.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Pampachaykuway chay sasachakuymanta.
Obviously it wouldn’t have been anyone else.	Sut’inmi mana huk runachu kanman karqan.
I suspect there are many.	Sospechani achka kasqanmanta.
Three good, one bad.	Kimsa allin, huk mana allin.
That’s not right, it’s not right at all.	Chayqa manan allinchu, manan allinchu ni imapipas.
But obviously, this isn’t what’s best for you.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, manan kayqa aswan allinchu qanpaq.
But I don’t agree.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu kani.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu.
It’s amazing isn’t it?.	Admirakuypaqmi manachu?.
Now I hear it coming.	Kunanmi uyarini hamunanta.
That he can buy it.	Chayqa rantiyta atisqanmanta.
It looked great here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
You probably can’t do it now.	Manachá kunanqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
For goodness sake, anyway.	Allinpaq, imayna kaptinpas.
He is afraid though.	Payqa manchakunmi ichaqa.
But he’s a young player.	Ichaqa payqa wayna pukllaqmi.
I want to be sure of that.	Chaymanta seguro kaytam munani.
If there’s nothing wrong with him, all the better.	Sichus mana imapas paywan mana allinchu chayqa, aswan allinmi.
That’s going to be crazy.	Chayqa loco kanqa.
I wanted to be sure of him.	Paymanta seguro kaytam munarqani.
there, good people.	chaypi, allin runakuna.
He tried but failed.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I need to do that more often.	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kutim ruwanay.
Certainly, it made sense.	Chiqamanta, allin yuyayniyuq karqa.
It really is a house now.	Chiqaptam kunanqa wasi kachkan.
He doesn’t know how to say this.	Payqa manan yachanchu kayta niyta.
So there are two things to do.	Chaymi iskay ruway kan.
I made him do the hard work.	Sinchi llank’ayta ruwananpaqmi payta ruwarqani.
Who, and really enjoyed themselves.	Pikuna, hinaspa chiqaptapuni kusisqa karqaku.
Certainly it could be worse.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan mana allinqa kanman.
That's probably the worst part.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan mana allinqa kanman.
You know, here, with me.	Yachanki, kaypi, ñuqawan.
I’m glad it’s only once.	Kusikuni huk kutilla kasqanmanta.
She looks really nice.	Payqa chiqaptam sumaq rikchakun.
It made it very sad.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi ruwarqa.
He was looking so funny.	Payqa ancha asikunapaq hinam kachkarqa.
He’s always been proud of me.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqamanta orgulloso karqan.
He was nobody and nothing.	Payqa manan pipas nitaq imapas karqanchu.
I don’t want him to come home.	Manam munanichu wasiman kutimunanta.
No one is there.	Mana pipas chaypiqa.
He looked at her a few times.	Payqa iskay kinsa kutitan qhawarirqan.
I know this very well.	Kaytaqa anchatam yachani.
I can’t swim.	Manam nadayta atinichu.
She's terrified he knows too much.	Payqa mancharisqa kachkan payqa llumpayta yachan.
So he’s alone.	Chaymi payqa sapallan.
That's about it.	Chayqa chaymantam kachkan.
This stuff is very, very important.	Kay imapas ancha, ancha importante.
It was a wonderful night.	Chay tutaqa ancha sumaq tutam karqa.
I wanted to stay there with him all night.	Tukuy tutan chaypi paywan qhepakuyta munarqani.
And be happy.	Hinaspa kusisqa kay.
I know he can do better.	Yachanim payqa aswan allinta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
But he knows a secret.	Ichaqa huk pakasqa kaqta yachan.
He had no idea what time it was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu ima tiempo kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t say anything.	Manam imatapas rimayta atirqanichu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinqa.
Everything looked the same as before.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaq hinam rikchakurqa.
I don't really know why.	Manam anchatachu yachani imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
In fact, it could be the second.	Chiqaptaqa, iskay kaqmi kanman.
But the truth is, he didn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
The new decade.	Musuq chunka wata.
And boy are we glad he did.	Hinaspa wayna kusisqa kayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But I'm not sure how to do that.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani imaynata chayta ruwanaypaq.
He was never much of a morning person.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha paqarin runachu karqan.
I want to be happier.	Aswan kusisqa kaytam munani.
Maybe it wasn’t right.	Ichapas mana allinchu karqa.
It’s been someone for a long time.	Unayñan pipas karqan.
I’m not ready for that yet.	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi listochu kani.
He knew now.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqa.
He better be there.	Payqa aswan allinmi chaypi kananpaq.
It’s good for me here.	Kaypiqa allinmi ñuqapaq.
You alone are the greatest in the world.	Qamllam kay pachapi aswan hatun kanki.
He knew how to work a party.	Payqa yacharqanmi huk fiestapi llank’ayta.
He couldn't say those things.	Chaykunataqa manam niyta atirqachu.
That’s what they want you to do.	Chaytan paykunaqa munanku ruwanaykita.
You don’t know who he is.	Manam yachankichu pi kasqanmantaqa.
I just know that they are.	Chaylla yachani chayna kasqankuta.
Two days passed.	Iskay punchawmi pasarqa.
That way it’s more interesting.	Chay hinaqa aswan sumaqmi.
He seemed rather annoyed.	Payqa aswan phiñasqa hinam karqa.
I feel like you’re not happy here.	Kaypiqa mana kusisqachu kasqaykita sientekuni.
That was nice of him.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa paymanta.
But he didn't know what it was now.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu kunan imachus kasqanmanta.
I'm not so sure.	Manam ancha segurochu kani.
A week ago they were strangers.	Huk semana ñawpaqtaqa mana riqsisqa runakunam karqaku.
He was exhausted after the day.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan chay p’unchay qhepaman.
She looked so amazing.	Payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
He couldn't say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta atirqanchu.
Being there.	Chaypi kay.
I don’t quite know the way.	Manam allintachu yachani chay ñanta.
It’s very difficult for me.	Ancha sasam ñuqapaq kachkan.
He was pretty sure he was safe by now.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan kunankamaqa seguro kashasqanmanta.
But the third is the big one.	Ichaqa kimsa kaq hatunmi.
Needless to say, it does.	Manañam niyta munanichu, chaytam ruwan.
It wasn’t all that difficult.	Manam tukuy chay sasachu karqa.
Newer this and the latest that.	Aswan musuq kay chaymanta qhipa kaq chay.
He is that good to me.	Payqa chaynatam ñuqapaq allin.
And then came the third act.	Hinaspa chaymanta hamurqan kinsa kaq ruway.
But this sounds a lot tougher.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan sinchitan uyarikun.
He didn’t know it wasn’t me.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu mana ñoqa kasqayta.
It won’t be easy for you.	Mana qampaq facilchu kanqa.
That would be a shallow accomplishment.	Chayqa mana ancha hatun ruwaymi kanman.
He felt very uncomfortable.	Payqa ancha mana allintachu tarikurqa.
I want to be arrested.	Hap'isqa kaytam munani.
You probably don't want to look at it properly.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu qawayta munanki.
It doesn’t seem very real now.	Kunanqa manan ancha cheqaqchu rikch’akun.
I couldn't bear to hear any more.	Manañam aguantayta atirqanichu astawan uyariyta.
I really didn’t want to do that.	Chiqamanta mana chayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
You probably know about it.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa yachanki.
I couldn't figure that out.	Chaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
So it’s very wrong.	Chaymi ancha pantasqa.
So glad it was included.	Chaymi kusisqa chay churasqa kasqanmanta.
And this is how he plans to do it.	Hinaspa kay hinata ruwayta yuyaykushan.
It should be so and so.	Chayna hinaspa chayna kanan.
He is the most beautiful.	Payqa aswan sumaqmi.
But we are happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kachkaniku.
It would have been amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanman karqa.
He said that this was wrong.	Chay ruwasqanqa mana allin kasqanmantam nirqa.
That doesn’t mean much.	Chayqa manan anchatachu niyta munan.
But this doesn’t seem to be the best option.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan allinchu rikch’akun.
You know who is the best for you and who is the worst.	Yachankim pikuna qampaq aswan allin kasqanmanta, pikuna mana allin kasqanmanta.
He seems almost depressed.	Yaqa llakisqa hinam kachkan.
He did everything he could to make me happy.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwarqa kusisqa kanaypaq.
But she was a smart girl.	Ichaqa yachaysapa sipasmi kasqa.
They were immigrants.	Paykunaqa huk llaqtamanta hamuq runakunam karqaku.
He knows things.	Payqa imakunatapas yachanmi.
That is a feat that would be amazing.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi, chayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman.
He had no idea how, but now he was sure.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatachus chayta, kunanmi ichaqa seguro kasharqan.
I mean, say one person couldn’t stand it.	Niyta munani, niy huk runa mana aguantayta atirqachu.
Everyone knows about it.	Lliwmi chaymantaqa yachanku.
No one wants to work there.	Manam pipas chaypi llamkayta munanchu.
All very happy.	Tukuy ancha kusisqa.
He didn’t want to go alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu riyta munarqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa huk allin kaqmi karqa.
And it looks like that.	Hinaspa chayna rikchakun.
He knows exactly what they are.	Payqa allintam yachan imakuna kasqankuta.
However, there is disagreement as to why.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu kanku imarayku chay hina kasqanmanta.
That is what it is still going to be.	Chayqa kunankamapas chayna kananpaqmi.
What if .	Imataq kanman sichus .
He may be from the past.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kanman.
If you want to be disappointed and sad.	Sichus munanki hukmanyasqa hinaspa llakisqa kayta.
In fact, you know this well.	Chiqaptaqa, kaytam allinta yachanki.
Not good, anyway.	Mana allinchu, imayna kaptinpas.
It should be big enough for you.	Qampaq hina hatunmi kanan.
I don’t worry too much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa llakikuni.
He seems really happy.	Payqa chiqap kusisqa hinam kachkan.
Many important people.	Achka importante runakuna.
He was really unsure about this.	Payqa chiqaptam mana segurochu karqa kaymanta.
I feel the same way you do.	Ñoqapas qan hinan sientekuni.
A few days, maybe.	Iskay kimsa punchaw, ichapas.
He had no idea how to swim.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna nadayta.
Yes, you do that.	Arí, qanmi chayta ruwanki.
If he doesn’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa.
We always have to fail.	Sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwananchik.
So you did that first.	Chaymi ñawpaqta chayta ruwarqanki.
No one knows what to do when that happens.	Chayna kaptinqa manam pipas yachanchu ima ruwananta.
More than one person, that got away.	Aswan huk runa, chaymi lluqsirqa.
I cannot stand this.	Kaytaqa manam aguantayta atiymanchu.
I’ll be here all the time.	Tukuy tiempo kaypi kasaq.
That was very recent.	Chayqa ancha chayllaraqmi chayna karqa.
I know how difficult it is.	Yachanim chay ruwayqa ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
He had nothing, no one, nowhere to go.	Payqa manan imapas karqanchu, manan pipas karqanchu, mana maymanpas rinanpaq.
Is that too difficult?.	¿Chay ancha sasachu?.
That’s the idea.	Chay yuyayniyuq.
I wanted to be happy.	Kusisqa kaytam munarqani.
It was that sure.	Chayna segurom karqa.
So it was nice to talk to him.	Chaymi sumaq karqa paywan rimayqa.
I’m now.	Ñuqaqa kunanqa.
I can’t get to it.	Manam chayman chayayta atiymanchu.
I feel very comfortable.	Ancha allinmi tarikuni.
I wouldn’t disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopichu kayman.
He’s the one who did these things.	Paymi chaykunataqa ruwarqan.
They know the language.	Paykunaqa yachanku chay rimayta.
Maybe it’s with him.	Ichapas paywan kanman.
Everything is too much.	Tukuy imapas llumpayta.
But this is the real world.	Ichaqa kaymi cheqaq pacha.
So, it is safe.	Chaymi, seguro kachkan.
He was a nice guy so far.	Kunankamaqa sumaq runam karqa.
He said you knew about it, too.	Payqa nirqam qampas chaymanta yachasqaykita, nispa.
He was already a better man.	Payqa ñam aswan allin runan karqa.
It was truly wonderful.	Cheqaqtapunin ancha sumaq karqan.
He knew everything was fine now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunanqa tukuy imapas allin kashasqanmanta.
I don’t need it again.	Manam hukmanta necesitasaqchu.
I don’t want you to be alone.	Manam munanichu sapallayki kanaykita.
He didn’t come alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu hamurqa.
This is actually very good.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi.
If it isn’t, it’s not.	Mana kaptinqa manam.
This seems worse.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi rikchakun.
Being a great person.	Hatun runa kay.
I don’t like uncertainty.	Manam gustanchu mana seguro kayqa.
Maybe that’s the case now.	Ichapas kunanqa chayna kanman.
I never thought of that.	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas piensarqanichu.
If it’s the former, it’s doing it wrong.	Ñawpaq kaq kaptinqa, mana allintachu ruwachkan.
This seemed to be one of them.	Kayqa hukninmi rikchakurqa.
Be happy anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas kusisqa kay.
Very wrong of me.	Ancha pantasqa ñuqamanta.
It was the most recent one.	Chayqa karqan aswan qhepa kaqmi.
He really knew.	Payqa chiqaptam yacharqa.
Sure he is.	Seguro payqa.
This is what it’s all about.	Kaymi tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
And that’s something stupid to do.	Hinaspa chayqa imapas sonso ruwaymi.
I wish someone would do something about him.	Munayman pipas paymanta imatapas ruwananta.
Fortunately that is not a good thing.	Ancha kusisqam chayqa manam allinchu.
It was always me, me, me.	Sapa kutim ñuqa, ñuqa, ñuqa karqani.
He didn't have to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwanan karqachu.
You are so unhappy.	Chayna mana kusisqam kanki.
I'm pretty sure he did.	Yaqa segurom kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
In more of a way.	Aswan huk hina.
Every day there was something new and interesting.	Sapa punchawmi huk musuq sumaq kaq karqa.
But he’s probably tired of her.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá paymanta sayk’usqa kashan.
Now will be the time.	Kunanmi chay tiempo kanqa.
But, you want to do that.	Ichaqa, chayta ruwayta munanki.
But that was not true.	Ichaqa manan chayqa cheqaqchu karqan.
So it’s not like him.	Chaymi mana pay hinachu.
Eventually he learned something else.	Qhepamanmi hukta yacharqan.
However, he’s great as a villain.	Ichaqa, payqa hatunmi millay runa hina.
Perhaps he wanted to avoid being alone.	Ichapas payqa mana sapallan kayta munarqa.
Ridiculously not bad.	Asikunapaq hina mana millay.
Then tell them well.	Chaymanta allinta willay.
That’s what it sounds like.	Chay hinam uyarikun.
But it’s his name.	Ichaqa sutinmi.
I hear it’s nice.	Uyarini sumaq.
They don’t know any better, you do.	Paykunaqa manan aswan allintachu yachanku, qanmi yachanki.
And now here you are.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi kachkanki.
It seemed really good.	Chiqap allin hinam karqa.
He probably won’t.	Yaqapaschá mana ruwanqachu.
So it was a wonderful time.	Chaymi ancha sumaq tiempo karqa.
It’s working there.	Chaypin llank’ashan.
And he did something.	Hinaspa imapas ruwarqa.
I would be set up.	Ñuqaqa churasqa kayman.
I want to be positive.	Ñuqaqa allin yuyayniyuq kayta munani.
He doesn’t think about it anymore.	Manaña chaypiqa yuyaykunchu.
She is a young woman.	Payqa huk sipasmi.
Who really knows, but him.	Pitaq chiqaptapuni yachan, ichaqa pay.
But he was very wrong.	Ichaqa anchatan pantasqa.
Doing a lot of things there.	Chaypi achka ruwaykunata ruwaspa.
He finally looked up.	Payqa tukukuypi qhawarisqa.
But that would be crazy.	Ichaqa chayqa loco kaymi kanman.
I am neither here nor there.	Manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kachkani.
He could have been one of them.	Payqa hukninmi kanman karqa.
This will make it easier.	Chayta ruwaspaqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
So what a great deal.	Chaymi ima hatun ruway.
But this guy.	Ichaqa kay runa.
Unfortunately he’s evil.	Llakikuypaqmi payqa millay.
I was cold, wet and miserable.	Chiri, chiri, llakisqa ima karqani.
I didn’t want to see that disappointment.	Manam chay hukmanyasqa kayta qawayta munarqanichu.
It’s really really tough.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta sinchi.
The big one was hungry.	Hatun kaqmi yarqaymanta kasqa.
This last feature is quite impressive.	Kay qhipa kaq ruwayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi.
There is no time left.	Manañam tiempo kanchu.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam sapa kutichu chayna kan.
Maybe he gave me one.	Ichapas hukta quwarqa.
Otherwise it is not a real process.	Mana chayqa manam chiqap ruwaychu.
Nothing else.	Manaña imapas.
This was completely fine.	Kayqa llapanpim allin karqa.
This meant that.	Kayqa niyta munarqa.
Now it’s not so easy.	Kunanqa manan chay hina facilchu.
A man came along.	Huk runam hamurqa.
Nobody did much of anything.	Manam pipas anchatachu imatapas ruwarqa.
And he's sick, anyway.	Hinaspa payqa unqusqa kachkan, imayna kaptinpas.
Like me, once upon a time.	Ñoqa hina, huk kuti.
They were icy cold.	Paykunaqa chiri chiri hinam karqaku.
I wanted to be so wrong.	Chayna ancha pantasqa kaytam munarqani.
He can do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwanman.
That way you’re not good enough.	Chay hinaqa manan allinchu kanki.
I thought nothing of it.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas piensarqanichu.
Yes, it’s a bad thing.	Arí, mana allinmi.
Me, never mind.	Ñuqa, mana haykapipas.
And then, there’s the truth.	Hinaspa chaymanta, kanmi chiqap kaq.
This makes the process more interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaq ruwayta ruwan.
He wants to sing again.	Payqa munanmi hukmanta takiyta.
I’d rather be alone.	Aswan allinmi kanman sapallan kay.
I’m actually not a good person.	Chiqaptaqa manam allin runachu kani.
I know he wants to get out of here.	Yachanim kaymanta lluqsiyta munasqanmanta.
I know he is.	Yachanim payqa.
Here again one last time.	Kaypiqa yapamanta huk qhipa kuti.
He made a double take.	Payqa iskay kutita hap’iyta ruwarqan.
It will do that then.	Chayta ruwanqa chaymanta.
They are much bigger than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi kanku.
He did it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq.
I didn't think he would.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna ruwananta.
Too much of everything.	Tukuy imamanta llumpay.
Nothing is certain.	Manam imapas segurochu kachkan.
But no, no, everything is fine.	Ichaqa manan, manan, tukuy imapas allinmi.
I will do anything and everything for you.	Imatapas, tukuy imatapas qampaq ruwasaq.
But it worked out fine.	Ichaqa allintam lluqsirqa.
We are very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kayku.
You’re not there, either.	Manam chaypichu kanki, nitaq.
That seemed nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Here or there.	Kaypi utaq chaypi.
We did the final steps.	Qhipa kaq ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
Not anywhere else.	Mana maypipas.
You know where the problem is.	Yachankim maypi chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Here is the main point.	Kaypim aswan allinqa kachkan.
He might want to come along with it.	Payqa ichapas chaywan kuska hamuyta munanman.
That’s how he eats.	Chaynatam mikun.
It was amazing to be there.	Chaypi kayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
No, I couldn’t do that.	Manan, manan chayta ruwayta atirqanichu.
And that’s why I wanted to stay.	Hinaspa chaymi qhepakuyta munarqani.
Great success.	Hatun allin ruway.
I don’t think anything of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensanichu.
I am absolutely sure of this.	Kaymantaqa chiqaptam seguro kani.
And every day is new.	Hinaspa sapa punchaw musuq.
Unfortunately it must be true.	Llakikuypaqmi chiqap kanan.
Today, he cannot make good on his failure.	Kunan tiempopiqa manan allintachu ruwayta atinman mana allin ruwasqanmanta.
The younger man was with him.	Sullk’a runaqa paywan kuskan kasqa.
A new world will come.	Musuq pacha hamunqa.
You cannot see the next step.	Qatiqnin ruwaytaqa manam qawayta atiwaqchu.
Not yesterday, longer.	Mana qayna punchawchu, aswan unayta.
In fact, he still is.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa hinallam kachkan.
He’s bad for you.	Payqa mana allinmi qampaq.
It may not be the same person.	Manapaschá kikin runachu kanman.
For some reason I couldn't sleep.	Imaraykupas manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
That's why I got in trouble, actually.	Chayraykum sasachakuypi tarikurqani, chiqaptaqa.
Neither bad nor good.	Ni mana allinchu nitaq allinchu.
Do it outside.	Hawapi ruway.
It wasn’t just that.	Mana chayllachu karqa.
For you for you	Qampaq qampaq .
Almost everything.	Yaqa tukuy ima.
He wants to be sure.	Payqa seguro kaytam munan.
I couldn’t find anything.	Mana imatapas tariyta atirqanichu.
If not today, that's all.	Mana kunan punchaw kaptinqa, chaylla.
No one knows that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
Now is the only chance.	Kunanqa sapallanmi chansa.
Again, it was nice.	Yapamanta, sumaqmi karqa.
Otherwise it was obvious what would happen.	Mana chayqa sut’inmi karqan imachus pasananta.
It sure wasn’t like him.	Seguro mana pay hinachu karqan.
Almost a year passed.	Yaqa huk watañam pasarqa.
No, it can’t be that way.	Manan, manan chay hinachu kanman.
He wanted to, but he couldn't.	Munarqa, ichaqa manam atirqachu.
I hope someone can help.	Suyachkani pipas yanapananta.
That’s a pretty easy thing to do.	Chayqa allin facil ruwaymi.
It was a cold winter day.	Chay punchawqa chiri chiri punchawmi karqa.
He’s a nice guy, very talented.	Payqa sumaq wayna, ancha yachaysapa.
Sure, sure, that’s all in the past now.	Seguro, seguro, chay tukuy ima ñawpaqpi kunan.
That’s double thanks.	Chayqa iskay kutita gracias nispa.
She was certainly enjoying herself.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
I think that’s a very difficult thing to do.	Yuyaykuni chay ruwayqa ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
But he had a lot to do that day.	Ichaqa chay punchawmi achka ruwanan karqa.
Then strangers again.	Chaymanta mana riqsisqa runakuna yapamanta.
I am absolutely sure.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam seguro kani.
Repeat each time for success.	Sapa kuti yapamanta ruway allin kananpaq.
Perhaps one of them was.	Yaqapaschá huknin chayna karqa.
Speed ​​or something like that.	Utqaylla utaq chayna kaq.
I knew what it was like, yes.	Yacharqanim imayna kasqanmanta, arí.
He can’t do anything else.	Manam hukta ruwayta atinchu.
He was a wicked man.	Payqa millay runam karqa.
No one thought it would happen.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu chay hina kananta.
I don’t want to be that person.	Manam chay runa kayta munanichu.
I know I did mine for sure.	Yachanim ñuqapa seguro ruwasqayta.
Maybe that was just this.	Ichapas chaylla kay karqa.
He doesn’t want to come.	Mana hamuyta munanchu.
But I always wanted to know.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi yachayta munarqani.
For some reason he always wanted to go.	Imaraykupas payqa sapa kutim riyta munarqa.
But this seemed fine.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Hopefully this helps.	Munaymanmi kay yanapananta.
But I didn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwarqanichu.
Yes, he was alone.	Arí, payqa sapallanmi karqa.
Okay, it looks good.	Allinmi, allinmi rikchakun.
It was his real name.	Chiqap sutinmi karqa.
He is doing very well on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi ancha allinta ruwachkan.
Know the story you want to tell.	Willayta munasqayki willakuyta yachay.
But it wasn't too bad yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi llumpay mana allinchu karqa.
The easy half.	Chay facil kuskan.
It’s just that the timing isn’t right for me.	Chaylla chay tiempo mana allinchu ñuqapaq.
I feel even more stupid now.	Kunanqa aswan sonso hinam tarikuni.
He just did it again.	Chayllaraqmi yapamanta ruwarqa.
Not much happened after that.	Chaymantaqa manam anchatachu pasarqa.
I do, yes, I do.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, arí.
You were never going to succeed.	Manam haykapipas allintachu ruwanayki karqa.
I don’t want to hear another word about this thing.	Manam kay imamanta huk rimayta uyariyta munanichu.
Action is not action.	Ruwayqa manam ruwaychu.
You really can’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atiwaqchu.
We have a lot of ideas.	Achka yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I never really knew.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu.
I love working with all of them.	Llapallankum llamkayta anchata munani.
Never what he wanted me to do.	Mana hayk’aqpas imatachus ruwanayta munasqanman hinachu.
Someone speaks.	Pipas riman.
One that is everything you could ever want and more.	Hukninmi tukuy ima haykapipas munasqayki hinaspa aswan achka.
Tomorrow would be a good day for that.	Chaypaqqa paqarinmi allin punchaw kanman.
This was a chance.	Kayqa huk chansa karqa.
He did this over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwarqan.
Okay, it probably won’t work.	Allinmi, manapaschá allintachu ruwanqa.
You can't get away with anything now.	Kunanqa manam imamantapas lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
I mean, no, you know.	Niyta munani, mana, yachanki.
Everything is wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allin.
Now, you have to do it for yourself.	Kunanqa, qampaq ruwanayki tiyan.
And then the next, then the next.	Hinaspa chaymanta qatiqnin, chaymanta qatiqnin.
Nothing will get any easier.	Manan imapas aswan facilchu kanqa.
Of course she refused.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana munarqanchu.
Everything will be fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
He took it out so fast.	Chayna utqayllam hurqurqa.
I don't think it's the best, not the only one.	Manam piensanichu aswan allin kananpaq, manam chayllachu.
He wouldn’t do that, of course.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu, sut’inmi.
I don’t want to see it.	Manam munanichu qawayta.
If you have to do something, do it now.	Imatapas ruwanayki kaptinqa kunan ruway.
People disagree.	Runakunaqa mana acuerdopichu kanku.
He was easy to be around.	Payqa facilmi karqa paywan kayqa.
He didn’t want to come.	Payqa manan hamuyta munarqanchu.
You will do well here.	Kaypiqa allintam ruwanki.
I don’t know everything about anything.	Manam imamantapas tukuy imatapas yachanichu.
I don’t want to know anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas yachayta munanichu.
A lot, in fact.	Anchata, chiqaptaqa.
They know now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi yachanku.
It wouldn’t be too good not to do it.	Mana ancha allinchu kanman mana ruwanaykipaqqa.
He did it with me.	Ñoqawanmi ruwarqa.
So that’s not.	Chaymi chaymi mana.
I don't see why he would.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa chayta ruwananta.
Go ahead and do that.	Riy, chayta ruway.
Nothing fails like success.	Manan imapas allin ruway hinaqa mana allintachu ruwan.
So it’s very bad.	Chaymi ancha mana allin.
He couldn’t understand it.	Chaytaqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu.
About a year ago, now.	Yaqa huk wata ñawpaqta, kunanqa.
So not sure what it is anymore.	Chaymi manaña segurochu imakuna kasqanmanta.
This is crazy stuff.	Kayqa loco kaymi.
He wasn't sure what to make of it.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chaymanta ima ruwananta.
This should take fewer steps.	Kayqa aswan pisi ruwaykunata ruwanan tiyan.
He wasn’t there yet.	Payqa manaraqmi karqachu.
He wanted it.	Payqa munarqanmi chayta.
I never thought he would.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna ruwananta.
Now he was in a pretty good mood.	Kunanqa allin allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
What he does is very bad.	Imatapas ruwan chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
I don’t know that for sure at all.	Chaytaqa manan imapipas allintachu yachani.
But something strange happened.	Ichaqa imapas admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I can fix food.	Mikhunata allichayta atiyman.
They weren’t here, after all.	Paykunaqa manan kaypichu karqanku, tukuy imamanta.
But he had to do something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
The drunk man was fine.	Chay machasqa runaqa allinmi kasqa.
And she’s a beautiful girl.	Hinaspa payqa sumaq sipasmi.
Of course, things could be worse.	Arí, imapas aswan mana allinmi kanman.
First, a .	Ñawpaqtaqa huk .
One of them wasn’t sure.	Hukninmi mana segurochu kasqa.
And so it was for a while.	Hinaspa chayna karqa huk tiempo.
Sorry for what he had done.	Llakisqa ima ruwasqanmanta.
Here is the current version.	Kaypi kunan kaq laya kachkan.
He says it’s for me.	Payqa ninmi ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
He soon left.	Pisi tiempollamantan ripurqan.
And he did it well.	Hinaspa allinta ruwarqan.
She was a beautiful, beautiful girl.	Payqa sumaq, sumaq sipasmi karqan.
I said it yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi nirqani.
He was there to help.	Payqa chaypim karqa yanapananpaq.
Not everyone is like this, unfortunately.	Manan llapa runachu kay hina kanku, llakikuypaqmi.
But I like the name.	Ichaqa sutinmi gustan.
Everything seemed fine, he said.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa, nispas nin.
I knew what was going to happen there.	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna pasananta.
Nothing was ever together.	Manam imapas haykapipas kuskachu karqa.
I don’t want to see it anymore.	Manañam qawayta munanichu.
But things went well.	Ichaqa allintam imapas pasarqa.
If it is that big.	Chayna hatun kaptinqa.
So, it means nothing.	Chaymi, mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
You are such a great guy.	Chayna hatunmi kanki.
It makes a statement.	Huk rimayta ruwan.
It just didn't seem right.	Chaylla mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
So, that’s what we did.	Chaymi, chaytam ruwarqayku.
Now that doesn’t matter.	Kunanqa manan chayqa imananpaschu.
He can’t hear it.	Payqa mana uyariyta atinchu.
No one ever wanted that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
It must be so great!.	¡Ancha hatunmi kanan!.
I've been doing it for half a year now.	Kunanqa kuskan watañam ruwachkani.
But he may not be able to.	Ichaqa manapaschá atinmanchu.
That’s what I’m afraid of.	Chaynatam manchakuni.
But this is ambiguous.	Ichaqa kayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
I’m sorry it wasn’t right.	Pampachaykuway mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
At least he was anything but.	Aswanpas payqa imapas karqan ichaqa.
No one could speak.	Manam pipas rimayta atirqachu.
Scared that something was really wrong.	Chiqamanta imapas mana allin kasqanmanta mancharisqa.
I am no longer human at all.	Manañam runachu kani ni imapipas.
Then it happened.	Chaymantam chayna pasarqa.
It could be two weeks.	Iskay semanan kanman.
But there is one big problem.	Ichaqa kanmi huk hatun sasachakuy.
I never did, for sure.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu, segurom.
There was some truth there.	Chaypiqa wakin cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
This was the chance.	Kaymi karqan chansa.
I don’t want to buy it now.	Manam kunanqa rantiyta munanichu.
You can do everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwawaq.
We really have to do it.	Chiqaptam ruwananchik.
Too much to hide.	Ancha achka pakasqa kananpaq.
That seems really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi rikchakun.
No one wants to be here.	Manam pipas kaypi kayta munanchu.
I don’t see him coming back.	Manam rikunichu kutimunanta.
Now, whether I can do it, I’m not sure.	Kunanqa, ruwayta atiymanchu icha manachu, mana segurochu kani.
I have known this for a long time.	Kaytaqa unayñam yachani.
So if you are serious about this have a go.	Chaymi sichus kaymanta serio kanki chayqa huk riy.
This whole thing is very interesting.	Kay tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi.
I don’t think you know.	Mana yachasqaykita yuyani.
And then it makes no sense.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
It may be useful later.	Qhepamanmi allin kanman.
I hear there are good people.	Uyarini allin runakuna kasqanmanta.
It was the perfect timing.	Chayqa karqan mana pantasqa tiempo.
It seemed all ridiculous.	Chayqa tukuy asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
Now I don't know what to do.	Kunanqa manañam yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
They were very hungry.	Paykunaqa llumpay yarqasqa karqaku.
I want to tell you what I mean.	Ima niyta munasqayta willayta munani.
Beautiful, beautiful person.	Sumaq, sumaq runa.
This, however, would be a serious mistake.	Kaymi ichaqa sinchi pantasqa kanman.
But he didn't know what it was.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu imatachus chayta.
If you want to leave, you should.	Ripuyta munanki chayqa, chaytan ruwanayki.
I felt drunk.	Machasqa hinam tarikurqani.
He can’t seem to get it.	Manapaschá chayta hap’iyta atinmanchu hina.
You better be here with us.	Aswan allinmi kanki kaypi ñuqaykuwan.
He’s not a stupid guy.	Payqa manan sonso runachu.
It doesn’t sound like it.	Mana hinachu uyarikun.
I don't know if he ever will.	Mana yachanichu hayk'aqllapas chayta ruwanqachu icha manachu chayta.
But it had to be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanan karqan.
He always wants to catch up.	Payqa sapa kutim hapiyta munan.
He took a cigarette, she took another.	Payqa huk cigarrota hap’irqan, payqa hukta hap’irqan.
These are difficult things to do.	Chaykunataqa sasa ruwaymi.
That’s a first.	Chayqa huk ñawpaq kaq.
This has been going on for a very long time.	Kayqa ancha unayñam kachkan.
Maybe you know it.	Ichapas yachanki.
You look ridiculous, he says.	Asikunapaq hinam rikchakunki, nispas nin.
There was a young man there.	Chaypim huk wayna kasqa.
So nothing wrong with that.	Chaymi mana ima mana allinchu chaypiqa.
This is a good first step.	Kayqa allin ñawpaq ruwaymi.
I’ve been thinking about it all night.	Tukuy tutan chaypi yuyaykushani.
Here, everything was as it should be.	Kaypiqa, tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam karqa.
I feel kind of stupid right now.	Kunanqa huk laya sonso hinam tarikuni.
This isn’t really about him.	Kayqa manan cheqaqtachu paymanta.
But about this at another time.	Ichaqa kaymanta huk tiempopi.
But there are some.	Ichaqa kanmi wakin.
Who are you, guys? 	¿Pitaq qam?
But someone has to do it.	Ichaqa pipas chayta ruwanan.
And then an hour.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk hora.
He couldn't believe it.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
The classroom activity is important.	Yachay wasipi ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
He knows you can.	Payqa yachanmi atisqaykita.
Worst restaurant ever.	Aswan mana allin mikhuy wasi hayk’aqpas.
There is nothing worse.	Manam aswan mana allinqa kanchu.
They are not sure.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu kanku.
You act sick.	Unqusqa hinam ruwanki.
I'm just so proud of you.	Chayllam ancha orgulloso kani qammanta.
He always refused.	Payqa sapa kutim mana munarqanchu.
That statement is ambiguous.	Chay nisqanqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
Bad bad wrong wrong bad.	Mana allin mana allin pantasqa mana allin.
Yes, this happened.	Arí, kayqa pasarqa.
After that he left.	Chay qhepamanmi payqa ripurqan.
Know what you want, and do it.	Ima munasqaykita yachay, hinaspa ruway.
One can barely buy it.	Huk runaqa yaqapaschá rantiyta atinman.
I thought about it almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi chaypi piensarqani.
I am looking for this information.	Kay willayta maskachkani.
He said he wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashasqanmanta nirqan.
Why would anyone do that?.	¿Imanasqataq pipas chayta ruwanman?.
That’s probably going to happen.	Chayqa yaqapaschá kanqa.
I tried very hard not to say anything.	Anchatam kallpanchakurqani mana imatapas rimanaypaq.
He decided not to say anything.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi mana imatapas rimananpaq.
I don’t want to stop talking about this.	Manañam kaymantaqa manaña rimayta munanichu.
To be like him.	Pay hina kananpaq.
Said he was busy.	Nisqa ocupasqa kasqanmanta.
That’s the greatness.	Chayqa hatun kaymi.
He seems to be angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam kachkan.
Now fast, boy.	Kunanqa usqhaylla, wayna.
But he knew who they were.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi pikuna kasqankuta.
He had no idea why he was here.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imarayku kaypi kasqanmanta.
That’s all there is for now.	Chayllam kunankamaqa kachkan.
He would certainly be good.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allin kanman.
I was two people.	Iskay runam karqani.
Both are arrested.	Iskayninkum hapisqa kanku.
Don’t be too stupid about it.	Ama chaymantaqa llumpay sonso kaychu.
It’s a constant process.	Chayqa sapa kutilla puriq ruwaymi.
I don't understand why that would happen.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa chayna kananta.

I couldn’t come.	Manam hamuyta atirqanichu.
So here’s what.	Chaymi kaypi ima.
He was the baby.	Paymi chay wawa kasqa.
That is what almost anyone can do today.	Chaytan kunan tiempopiqa yaqapaschá pipas ruwayta atin.
And he wanted to see her.	Hinaspa payta rikuyta munarqa.
There’s nothing wrong with that! 	¡Manan imapas chaypiqa!
I don’t remember that.	Manam chaymantaqa yuyarinichu.
Can't let that happen again.	Mana chayta yapamanta pasananta saqiyta atinchu.
He probably couldn’t.	Manachá atirqachu.
He wanted to be new.	Payqa musuq kaytam munarqa.
Difficulty performing familiar tasks.	Riqsisqa ruwaykunata sasa ruway.
He is so much more than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi.
One said.	Huk nisqa.
He was one, he was sure of it.	Payqa hukninmi karqa, payqa segurom karqa chaymanta.
He wants things to be nice.	Payqa munanmi imapas sumaq kananta.
There was no better way to do it.	Manam aswan allin ruwayqa karqachu.
He’s obviously tired.	Payqa sut’inmi sayk’usqa kashan.
And maybe he was one, there.	Hinaspa ichapas payqa huknin karqa, chaypi.
Still, he wanted to know more.	Chayna kaptinpas astawan yachayta munarqa.
Above all, you have to act accordingly.	Tukuy imamantapas chayman hinam ruwanayki.
This has always been difficult for me.	Kayqa sapa kutim sasa karqa ñuqapaq.
You will soon learn how to do this.	Pisi tiempollamantan yachanki imaynatas chayta ruwawaq chayta.
Ten years ago now.	Chunka wata ñawpaqta kunan.
One of them came to my school.	Hukninmi yachay wasiyman hamurqa.
Not there, then there.	Mana chaypichu, chaymantaqa chaypi.
He does things right.	Payqa allintam imatapas ruwan.
It was like this.	Kay hinam karqa.
When he did, it looked so easy.	Chayta ruwaptinqa ancha facilmi rikchakurqa.
I hope it works out for him.	Suyachkani paypaq allin kananpaq.
Okay, more than a little.	Allinmi, aswan huk chikan.
Not too bad, actually.	Mana ancha mana allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
Things looked really good.	Imapas chiqap allinmi rikchakurqa.
It is something that is better or worse.	Imapas aswan allin utaq mana allin kaqmi.
Obviously they are not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu kanku.
He was probably the only one there.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaypiqa sapallan kasharqan.
I will make him mine.	Paytaqa ñuqapaq ruwasaq.
He is not a real person.	Payqa manam chiqap runachu.
That’s what I want.	Chaynatam munani.
I would love to hear this.	Kayta uyariyta anchata munani.
Later, rather later, in the car.	Qhepamanmi, aswan qhepaman, carropi.
And the sooner the better.	Hinaspa aswan utqaylla aswan allinqa.
It’s been bad for a very long time.	Ancha unayñan mana allinchu.
Now tell me.	Kunanqa niy.
I doubt he was alone.	Iskayrayani sapallan kasqanmanta.
What a great, great player he was.	Ima hatun, hatun pukllaqmi karqan.
So, here you go.	Chaymi, kaypi riy.
I hear it two or three times a day, every day.	Uyarini iskay kimsa kutita sapa punchaw, sapa punchaw.
That was by no means a success.	Chayqa manan imaraykupas huk allin ruwaychu karqan.
After all, it seems.	Tukuy imamanta, rikchakun.
This was a good thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi karqa.
So I had an idea.	Chaymi huk yuyayniyuq karqani.
This was a strange thing.	Kayqa mana riqsisqa kaqmi karqa.
I couldn't do anything without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
Or a year.	Utaq wata.
Great, actually.	Hatun, chiqaptaqa.
And again, no.	Hinaspa yapamanta, mana.
That’s not the worst part.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu.
This is more .	Kayqa aswan .
So far it has been so good.	Kunankamaqa chayna allinmi karqa.
I don’t want to play this game.	Kay pukllayta mana pukllayta munanichu.
This all sounds familiar.	Kay tukuy imapas riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
Something is seriously wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas sinchi hatun mana allinmi kachkan.
A first for me.	Huk ñawpaq kaq ñuqapaq.
And there was the beauty thing.	Hinaspa chaypi kasqa sumaq kay kaq.
I haven’t seen him in a long time.	Unayñan paytaqa manaña rikunichu.
He was in deep distress.	Payqa sinchitan llakisqa kasharqan.
He will do well here.	Payqa allintam kaypi ruwanqa.
You can’t get out.	Manam lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
I can’t seem to figure out how to do that.	Manapaschá chayta ruwanaypaqqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu hina.
Then every month.	Chaymanta sapa killa.
The third, however.	Kimsa kaq, ichaqa.
That's all really.	Chayllam chiqaptaqa.
Here, for you.	Kaypi, qampaq.
You’re just there.	Chayllaraqmi kachkanki.
He knows where this thing is.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kay imapas kasqanmanta.
That’s where we disagree.	Chaypin mana acuerdopichu kayku.
I can’t wait though.	Manam suyayta atinichu ichaqa.
That would have been wonderful.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman karqa.
This doesn't seem right though.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun ichaqa.
I didn’t know how true this was.	Manam yacharqanichu kay imayna chiqap kasqanmanta.
No, he’s great.	Manan, payqa hatunmi.
Two months went by, nothing.	Iskay killa pasarqa, mana imapas.
So far, however, this has not worked.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan chay ruwasqanqa allinchu.
Now you are mine.	Kunanqa ñuqapa kanki.
Again, happy birthday.	Yapamanta, kusisqa p'unchaw.
First of all, this is not true.	Ñawpaqtaqa, kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
Not to be.	Mana kananpaqchu.
Do what you need to do to succeed.	Allinta ruwanaykipaq imatachus ruwanaykita ruway.
I don’t want to tell this story.	Manam kay willakuyta willayta munanichu.
They’re beautiful, rich and elegant.	Paykunaqa sumaq, qhapaq, sumaq rikch’ayniyuq ima kanku.
That’s it, everything.	Chayqa, tukuy ima.
I didn’t know at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan yacharqanichu.
Once he did a bigger job.	Huk kutipi aswan hatun llamk’ayta ruwarqan.
That is his real name, his only name.	Chayqa chiqap sutinmi, sapallan sutinmi.
The task will not be easy, however.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu kanqa ichaqa.
You think you’re very smart.	Ancha yachaysapa kasqaykita yuyanki.
This was not always the case.	Kayqa manam sapa kuti hinachu karqa.
I was that girl.	Ñuqaqa chay sipasmi karqani.
And the next time, and the next time.	Hinaspa qatiqnin kutipi, hinaspa qatiqnin kutipi.
That’s who he wanted to be.	Chayqa pi kaytan munarqan.
I want to ask you something.	Imatapas tapuyta munani.
But nobody likes it.	Ichaqa manan pipas gustanchu.
He wanted to continue his studies.	Payqa hinallam estudiayta munarqa.
People like that, you never know.	Chayna runakunaqa, manam haykapipas yachankichu.
I’m not happy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu kani.
Maybe he could have done better.	Ichapas aswan allinta ruwanman karqa.
But he knew that wasn’t the only thing.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chaylla kasqanta.
I can’t find any solution.	Manam ima allichayta tarinichu.
Everyone has their own responsibilities.	Sapa runam ima ruwanan kan.
Was he really the one.	¿Cheqaqtachu payqa karqan.
What are you doing.	Imataq kanki.
Tell me all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta willaway.
I haven’t seen him yet.	Manaraqmi paytaqa rikurqanichu.
No, no, nothing like that.	Manan, manan, manan imapas chay hinaqa.
Repeatedly and at the same speed.	Sapa kuti hinaspa kaq utqaylla ruway.
Like in the school.	Yachay wasipi hina.
It’s a lonely thing to do.	Chayqa sapallan ruwaymi.
The way it is.	Imayna kasqanmanta.
You are a wicked man.	Qamqa millay runam kanki.
It wasn't meant to be serious at all.	Manam imapipas serio kananpaqchu karqa.
They certainly agree and .	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin acuerdopi kanku hinaspa .
I wanted to get this right.	Kayta allinta tariyta munarqani.
But he knew everything was ready for him.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi tukuy imapas paypaq listo kashasqanmanta.
I used to be that person.	Ñawpaqtaqa chay runam karqani.
He wants to get rid of me.	Payqa ñuqamanta lluqsiyta munan.
This he, of course, could not do.	Kaytaqa payqa, chiqamanta, mana ruwayta atirqachu.
It’s a beautiful thing.	Sumaq kasqanmanta.
She knew he wanted to tell her.	Payqa yacharqanmi willayta munasqanmanta.
The winter that followed was fine.	Chay qhepamanmi chiri tiempopiqa allin karqan.
Even if it’s nothing funny, it’s tough.	Manaña imapas asikunapaq kaptinpas, sinchi sasam.
That’s how he looked at it.	Chay hinata qhawarisqa.
The bad guy may not.	Mana allin runaqa manapaschá.
All day at home.	Tukuy punchaw wasipi.
Maybe it’s a year.	Ichapas huk wata kanman.
I don’t want to be alone anymore.	Manañam sapallay kayta munanichu.
He says he needs someone to talk to.	Paymi nin piwanpas rimananpaq necesitasqanmanta.
He felt tired all day.	Tukuy punchawmi sayk’usqa hina tarikurqa.
But he couldn’t walk.	Ichaqa manan puriyta atirqanchu.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina karqan.
Man is very happy.	Runa ancha kusisqa.
It's obviously cold.	Sut'inmi chiri.
I don’t want to eat anything.	Manam imatapas mikuyta munanichu.
He was an older man.	Payqa kuraq runam karqa.
One means something else.	Hukninmi hukta niyta munan.
It won’t be bad.	Manam mana allinchu kanqa.
But this doesn't seem like an easy task.	Ichaqa kayqa mana facil ruwaychu rikchakun.
That’s a big if though.	Chayqa hatun sichus ichaqa.
He can’t, he never will.	Payqa manan atinchu, manan hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu.
Today, however, this is not the case.	Kunan tiempopiqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Not yet as it is.	Manaraq hinachu.
So that’s where we are now.	Chaymi kunan chaypi kachkaniku.
You were you were a teacher.	Qamqa karqanki yachachiqmi karqanki.
But that was the worst part.	Ichaqa chaymi aswan mana allinqa karqan.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manan allinchu.
He wants to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munan.
And that means everyone.	Hinaspa chay niyta munan llapa runa.
People didn’t agree with him.	Runakunaqa manan paywan acuerdopichu karqanku.
Again no one can answer.	Yapamanta mana pipas kutichiyta atinmanchu.
You’re the one.	Qamqa kanki.
It’s the present.	Kunanmi kanan.
And then go again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta riy.
Indeed, he is.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa.
Every day I learn some strange new truth.	Sapa punchawmi yachani wakin mana riqsisqa musuq chiqap kaqta.
That was the right thing to do.	Chayqa karqan allin ruwaymi.
That was probably so good.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayna allin karqa.
However, you are also human.	Ichaqa, qampas runam kanki.
Two, no more.	Iskay, manaña.
Three o'clock in the afternoon.	Kimsa tarde.
Not good at all, really.	Mana imapipas allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
You never know what might happen.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu imakuna pasananta.
He didn't seem all that upset.	Payqa manan chay hina phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
Probably there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi.
You know, but young.	Yachanki, ichaqa wayna.
There was nothing anyone could have done.	Manam imatapas pipas ruwayta atinmanchu karqa.
That seems to be the case though.	Chayqa kanman hinam ichaqa.
So maybe he’ll be at it again.	Chaymi ichapas hukmanta chaypi kanman.
Yes, that’s a bad thing.	Arí, chayqa mana allinmi.
It was great for me too.	Ñuqapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Or the tenth.	Utaq chunka kaq.
This, it seems, is a rather difficult task.	Kayqa, aswan sasa ruwaymi rikchakun.
Obviously not.	Sut'inmi mana.
It's almost always funny.	Yaqa sapa kutim asikunapaq hina.
He looks like he couldn't be happier.	Payqa manapaschá aswan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu hinam rikchakun.
And that’s pretty cool.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha chiri.
This went very well.	Kayqa ancha allintam pasarqa.
Needless to say, that would be huge.	Manañam niyta munanichu, chayqa ancha hatunmi kanman.
At one time it was fine.	Huk tiempopiqa allinmi karqa.
The people are amazing, really, really nice people.	Runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi, chiqap, chiqap sumaq runakunam.
It’s not that it’s not true.	Manan mana cheqaqchu.
He wanted to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi munarqa.
Perhaps in the context of the time.	Ichapas chay tiempopi chayna kasqanpi.
No one knew what had happened.	Manan pipas imachus pasasqanmantaqa yacharqanchu.
I would never, ever, do that.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas, chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
There is a third person.	Kimsa kaq runam kachkan.
That doesn’t mean they’re bad.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana allinchu kasqankuta.
More sick first.	Aswan unqusqa ñawpaqta.
Yes, everyone knows that.	Arí, chaytaqa llapallankum yachanku.
It would be easy.	Facilmi kanman.
More to come on that!.	¡Astawan chaymanta hamunqa!.
I really can't stand it.	Chiqaptaqa manam aguantayta atinichu.
People are never happy.	Runakunaqa manan hayk’aqpas kusisqachu kanku.
He is always tired.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi sayk’usqa kashan.
Do that and let me know if it works.	Chayta ruway hinaspa willaway sichus allin kanman chayqa.
A couple of days.	Huk iskay punchaw.
Maybe someone else.	Ichapas huk runa.
She was a great girl.	Payqa hatun sipasmi karqan.
Always more and more unrealistic.	Sapa kuti aswan aswan mana chiqap kaq.
Many were black.	Achka yana karqanku.
I hope you are safe where you are.	Suyachkani maypichus kachkanki chaypi seguro kasqaykita.
But these two.	Ichaqa kay iskay.
I feel very sad.	Anchatam llakisqa tarikuni.
I don't understand how anyone could have done that.	Manam entiendenichu imaynatam pipas chayta ruwanman karqa.
I was very disappointed.	Sinchitan hukmanyasqa karqani.
Really bad, that.	Chiqamanta millay, chay.
I can’t do more, I don’t want to do anything else.	Manam aswan ruwayta atiymanchu, manañam imatapas ruwayta munanichu.
I felt like I had no idea.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqani.
It just had to happen.	Chayllaraqmi kanan karqa.
He said he wasn’t sure yet.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kashasqanmanta nisqa.
Stop doing all that stuff.	Amaña tukuy chayta ruwaychu.
I wonder what it is.	Imataq kasqanmanta tapukuni.
Everything went easy and fast.	Tukuy imapas facilmi hinaspa utqayllam rirqa.
He will be long gone now.	Payqa unayñan kunanqa manaña kanqachu.
That is something he would not have done.	Chaytan payqa mana ruwanmanchu karqan.
He is not a real person.	Payqa manan cheqaq runachu.
Maybe this weekend.	Ichapas kay semana tukukuypi.
Something is good.	Imapas allinmi.
I have a feeling something is wrong.	Ñuqaqa imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu karqan.
Or well, really.	Utaq allin, chiqap.
A few here.	Huk iskay kimsa kaypi.
No, that would be wrong.	Manan, chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
He looked a little hurt.	Payqa huk chhikanta k’irisqa qhawarisqa.
It couldn't be easier actually.	Mana aswan facilchu kanman chiqaptaqa.
Nasty, nasty people.	Millay, millay runakuna.
How’s this for you.	Imaynataq kayqa qampaq.
He knows what he wants.	Payqa yachanmi ima munasqanmanta.
Or the house itself.	Utaq kikin wasi.
This, however, is not the best.	Kaymi ichaqa mana aswan allinchu.
I did a lot of good things.	Achka allintam ruwarqani.
Very likely it won’t.	Ancha yaqapaschá mana kanqachu.
So it seemed very bad.	Chaymi sinchi mana allin hina karqan.
But then he had nowhere else to go.	Chaymantam ichaqa manaña maymanpas rinanpaq karqachu.
Probably a few times.	Yaqapaschá iskay kinsa kutita.
He is the first.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq.
Sorry I’m a little late.	Pampachaykuway huk chikan tarde kasqaymanta.
You have an idea.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
Very, very bad thing.	Ancha ancha mana allin kaq.
It’s not unreasonable.	Mana mana yuyayniyuqchu.
Of course, he doesn’t plan to.	Arí, manan chayta ruwayta yuyaykunchu.
I thought we should.	Yuyarqanim chayta ruwananchikpaq.
Be a really smart person.	Chiqap yachaysapa runa kay.
No one knew how that would work.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imaynatachus chay ruway kananta.
Thank you thank you!!!.	Gracias gracias!!!.
That's amazing that it is.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi kasqanmanta.
They were there.	Chaypin karqanku.
That was a process.	Chay ruwayqa huk ruwaymi karqan.
Nothing could be more difficult.	Manan imapas aswan sasachu kanman.
He’s got it right.	Allinta hap’isqa.
That’s better for me.	Chayqa aswan allinmi ñuqapaq.
He will come again soon.	Payqa usqhayllan yapamanta hamunqa.
And that’s what they want.	Hinaspa chaytam munanku.
He will be in the hospital for a while.	Payqa huk tiempo hospitalpi kanqa.
I can't think about that right now.	Chaypiqa manam kunanqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
But he came with me.	Paymi ichaqa ñoqawan kuska hamurqan.
But tonight, no one.	Ichaqa kunan tutan, mana pipas.
Everyone was happy.	Llapallankum kusisqa karqaku.
So far, this rumor seems interesting.	Kunankamaqa kay rimayqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
No one does anything.	Manan pipas imatapas ruwanchu.
Who was it supposed to be.	Pitaq kanan karqa.
He was so tired, so so, so tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa, ancha ancha, ancha sayk’usqa.
It will come next year.	Hamuq wata hamunqa.
I want to buy the best or the best.	Aswan allin kaqta utaq aswan allin kaqta rantiyta munani.
That speaks volumes.	Chayqa anchatam riman.
Nothing will happen immediately.	Manam imapas chayllachu kanqa.
You’re probably hungry.	Yaqapaschá yarqasqa kashanki.
Yeah, well, maybe it was.	Arí, allinmi, ichapas chayna karqa.
I do like this job.	Kay llamkayta hinam ruwani.
But he knew it was wrong.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
And so much more.	Hinaspa aswan achkata.
I don’t like being cold.	Manam gustawanchu chiri kayqa.
Okay, he doesn't want to see it.	Allinmi, payqa manam rikuyta munanchu.
Much, much worse.	Aswan, aswan mana allinmi.
Is that a good or bad thing? 	¿Allinchu icha manachu chay?
Anyway, it worked out fine.	Imayna kaptinpas, allinmi lluqsirqa.
Maybe it was for me.	Ichapas ñuqapaq hina karqa.
Everything was fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqan.
I wanted to speed up the process.	Chay ruwayta usqhaylla ruwayta munarqani.
I was lucky to be there.	Suerteyoqmi karqani chaypi kasqaymanta.
We need to do this very quickly.	Chaytaqa ancha utqayllam ruwananchik.
But nothing less true.	Ichaqa manan imapas pisi cheqaqchu.
I wish I could.	Munaymanmi chaynata.
He looks really hurt.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa rikch’akun.
It was just ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinallam karqa.
Do it with us.	Ruway ñuqaykuwan kuska.
Can’t say enough about him.	Mana allintachu paymanta niyta atin.
It’s something you have to do.	Chayqa imapas ruwanaykipaqmi.
But we kept doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam ruwarqayku.
Indeed, he would be lonely.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa sapallan kanman.
He can handle her now.	Payqa kunanmi paytaqa manejayta atinman.
It was like mine.	Chayqa ñuqapa kaq hinam karqa.
It is rather devastating.	Aswanpas sinchi llakikuypaqmi.
But this is now.	Ichaqa kunanmi kayqa.
Okay, that was it.	Allinmi, chaymi karqa.
Nothing about it can remind him of home.	Manan imapas chaymantaqa wasinta yuyariyta atinmanchu.
All the time, nothing.	Tukuy pacha, mana imapas.
Each person is important.	Sapa runam ancha importante.
He was really worried about it, but he did it.	Payqa sinchitan llakisqa kasharqan chaymanta, ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
He would do well.	Allintan ruwanman.
You were the only one.	Qamllam karqanki.
Maybe he’s not here.	Ichapas payqa mana kaypichu kachkan.
It’s not like that.	Mana chay hinachu.
This evening.	Kunan chisi.
What do they want.	Imatataq munanku.
You want to say what you think here.	Kaypi yuyaykusqaykita niyta munanki.
I hear it’s very popular.	Uyarini ancha riqsisqa kasqanmanta.
Now he could do his thing tonight.	Kunanqa kunan tutan ruwananta ruwanman karqan.
I think you’re the best.	Ñoqaqa yuyaykuni qanmi aswan allin kasqaykita.
It will be very difficult.	Ancha sasam kanqa.
Yes, it was that good.	Arí, chayna allinmi karqa.
Nonsense, but true.	Mana yuyayniyuq, ichaqa chiqap.
You were alone.	Sapallanmi karqanki.
It was a man who came twice.	Chayqa iskay kutita hamuq runam karqa.
I can’t help him.	Manam paytaqa yanapayta atiymanchu.
I feel confused.	Pantasqa tarikuni.
The man was not very happy.	Chay runaqa manam ancha kusisqachu kasqa.
He can't bear it not happening.	Manam aguantayta atinchu mana pasananta.
This guy isn’t good enough.	Kay runaqa manam allinchu.
Both are well hidden.	Iskayninku allin pakasqa.
The truth is that it is important.	Chiqap kaqmi ancha allin kasqanmanta.
No one can do this.	Manan pipas kaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
I would have never done that either.	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
Then he talks about it.	Chaymantam riman.
It’s really absurd.	Chiqaptam mana yuyayniyuq.
It was so easy at one time.	Huk tiempopiqa ancha facilmi karqa.
This is a new character.	Kayqa musuq runam.
This seemed as good as anywhere.	Kayqa maypipas hina allinmi rikchakurqa.
I learned later.	Qhepamanmi yacharqani.
So do the right thing.	Chaymi allin kaqta ruway.
But you have to do something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruwanayki.
They want to eat.	Mikhuyta munanku.
We are stupid.	Sonso kanchik.
It’s not always a bad thing.	Manam sapa kutichu mana allinqa.
He wants to walk to school with you.	Payqa munanmi qanwan kuska yachay wasiman puriyta.
They were the real thing.	Paykunaqa cheqaq kaqmi karqanku.
You absolutely have to.	Qamqa chiqaptam ruwanayki.
I’m a pretty tough guy.	Ñuqaqa allin sinchi runam kani.
I don’t want to repeat it.	Manam yapamanta rimayta munanichu.
Learn how it is here.	Imayna kasqanmanta kaypi yachay.
You are a beautiful girl.	Qamqa sumaq sipasmi kanki.
But it’s about him.	Ichaqa paymanta.
I couldn't understand them.	Chaykunataqa manam entiendeyta atirqanichu.
All good there.	Tukuy allin chaypi.
I’m okay with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi kani.
Everything would be so easy.	Tukuy imapas ancha facilmi kanman.
Now, tell me this.	Kunanqa, kayta willaway.
So far, it looks great.	Kunankamaqa, ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
He was in the form of a man.	Payqa runa hinam kachkarqa.
Everything there was amazing.	Chaypi tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi karqa.
If you don’t, you really, really should.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, chiqamanta, chiqamanta ruwanayki tiyan.
They are both adults, after all.	Iskayninkum kuraq runakuna, tukuy imamanta.
Maybe it was me.	Ichapas ñuqa karqani.
All the evil things.	Tukuy millay kaq.
He says so, himself.	Chaynatam nin, kikin kikin.
I have no belief in that at all.	Chaypiqa manam imapipas creenichu.
But he couldn’t do this alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
But we’re okay with that.	Ichaqa chaywanqa allinmi kayku.
This is not always the case.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna kan.
He was just like you.	Payqa qan hinan karqan.
I actually feel better today.	Cheqaqtapunin kunan p’unchay allinta sientekuni.
If that were the case.	Sichus chayna kanman karqa.
Anyone out there knows you are real.	Chay hawapi pipas yachan chiqap kasqaykita.
Available for the first time.	Ñawpaq kutita tarikun.
And now, he’s gone.	Hinaspa kunanqa, payqa manañan kanchu.
He said he would be there.	Chaypi kasaq nispas nisqa.
Go do something great.	Riy ima hatun ruwaytapas.
You can’t answer that.	Manan chaytaqa kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
I really didn't see it coming.	Chiqaptaqa manam hamunanta rikurqanichu.
But then something.	Ichaqa chaymanta imapas.
I’m not there anymore.	Manañam ñuqaqa kanchu.
I am a man with a bad name.	Huk runam kani mana allin sutiyuq.
After that, it was always lower.	Chay qhepamanmi sapa kutilla aswan pisi karqan.
I can’t wait for him to know.	Manam suyayta atiymanchu yachananta.
Something was really wrong.	Imapas chiqaptam mana allinchu karqa.
He is not alone.	Sapallanmi mana kanchu.
Perhaps that is not a good thing.	Yaqapaschá chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
No idea, but there it is.	Mana yuyayniyuq, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
This one was the one.	Kay hukninmi karqa.
It was very nice of him.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa paymanta.
Maybe they were sick of it.	Ichapas chaywan unqusqa karqaku.
That is not good at all.	Chayqa manam allinchu ni imapipas.
It will take a while.	Huk tiempon kanqa.
I suspect it is not.	Sospechani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He should be happy, but he’s not.	Payqa kusisqa kanan, ichaqa manan.
You can’t go from there.	Manam chaymantaqa riyta atiwaqchu.
Everything is very interesting.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi.
It’s an amazing evening.	Admirakuypaqmi chisi.
I know you will do a great job with it.	Yachanim chaywan hatun llamkayta ruwanaykita.
We seem to be ready.	Listo hinam kachkaniku.
I can't see those things.	Chaykunataqa manam qawayta atiymanchu.
He was originally a .	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa huk .
So far, it’s the saddest part.	Kunankamaqa aswan llakikuypaqmi.
It’s cold outside tonight.	Kunan tutaqa hawapi chiri kachkan.
There was someone every day.	Sapa punchawmi pipas karqa.
He was gone the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon manaña karqanchu.
In the difficult situation.	Sasachakuypi.
In the same prison.	Chay kikin carcelpi.
They were very secure.	Paykunaqa ancha segurom karqaku.
It happened pretty quickly.	Chayqa allin utqayllam pasarqa.
This isn’t the case.	Manam kayqa kanchu.
There are a lot of unhappy people.	Achka mana kusisqa runakunam kachkan.
It was such a disappointment.	Chayna hukmanyasqa karqa.
I’m not sure what happens next.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna chaymanta pasananta.
They all agreed.	Llapallankum acuerdopi karqaku.
Which is the first one.	Imataq ñawpaq kaq.
He wants to win here.	Payqa kaypi atipayta munan.
But this was not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kayqa karqan.
He acted quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwarqan.
It had to be strong.	Sinchi kanan karqan.
They were obvious.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi karqanku.
Here he was not sure.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu karqa.
I can't remember that.	Manam chaynataqa yuyariyta atinichu.
What happened to him.	Paywan ima pasasqanmanta.
He can't hold it.	Mana hapiyta atinchu.
That’s not what he did for that.	Chaypaqqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
That’s what he does.	Chaytan pay ruwan.
No one did it right.	Manam pipas allintachu ruwarqa.
I knew this before.	Kaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi yacharqani.
Now they are now.	Kunanqa kunanmi kachkanku.
I’m sure you agree with that.	Seguro kani chaywan acuerdopi kasqaykita.
And then he had to stop pretending.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manañam hinachu ruwanan karqa.
So today was that day.	Chaymi kunan punchaw chay punchaw karqa.
I'm sure it will all be up tomorrow.	Seguro kani paqarin tukuy imapas kanqa.
If anything, he had a bad attitude.	Imapas kaptinqa mana allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He spoke rapidly, in earnest.	Payqa usqhayllan rimarqan, sinchi llakisqa.
Perhaps he will be gone.	Ichapas payqa manaña kanqachu.
Okay, how about this.	Allinmi, imaynataq kayqa.
I had this wonderful idea.	Kay sumaq yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
That’s just the way it is.	Chayqa chay hinallam.
It’s just not enough.	Chaylla mana chayllachu.
No one and all.	Mana pipas hinaspa llapan.
A scientist.	Huk yachaysapa runa.
And good there you are, great.	Hinaspa allin chaypi kanki, ancha allin.
It was funny, really.	Asikunapaq hinam karqa, chiqaptapuni.
He hasn’t been here that long really.	Payqa manan chay unaytachu kaypi kashan cheqaqtapuni.
It was a good year.	Allin wata kasqa.
Unfortunately, you weren't there.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chaypichu karqanki.
He didn’t have to do anything about it.	Chaypaqqa manan imatapas ruwanan karqanchu.
Otherwise, he will be expelled.	Mana chayna kaptinqa qarqusqa kanqa.
I have seen it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa rikurqani.
He was a driving instructor.	Payqa yachachiqmi carrota manejayta.
Nothing ever could.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
I was here all night.	Tukuy tutan kaypi karqani.
He wanted you to be as happy as he was.	Payqa munarqanmi pay hina kusisqa kanaykita.
I do the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwani.
You were very happy.	Ancha kusisqam karqanki.
If that wouldn’t work, it would.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman chayqa, allinmi kanman.
Can't bear to wait, you know.	Mana aguantayta atinchu suyayta, yachanki.
You are nothing like him.	Qamqa manam imapas pay hinachu kanki.
That would be huge.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi kanman.
Obviously he is.	Sut’inmi payqa.
These people have always existed.	Kay runakunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
Of course, it wasn’t easy.	Arí, manan facilchu karqan.
I want to get them terribly bad.	Chaykunataqa manchay mana allintam hapiyta munani.
Things weren’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu imapas chhayna karqan.
People are hungry and hungry.	Runakunaqa yarqaymanta, yarqaymanta.
But this is rather unfortunate.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan llakikuypaqmi.
Or no one knows.	Utaq mana pi yachanchu.
It was safe there.	Chaypin seguro karqan.
There is no one here.	Manam pipas kaypichu kachkan.
But not in solitude.	Ichaqa manan sapallan kaypichu.
This one time, please.	Kay huk kutilla, ama hina kaspa.
Do better than that next time.	Chaymanta aswan allinta ruway hamuq kutipi.
Yes, that sounds great.	Arí, chayqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
We are together every day.	Sapa punchawmi kuska kayku.
This is bad, bad, bad.	Kayqa mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
I am usually very anxious.	Yaqa llapanpim anchata llakikuni.
Otherwise, you won't be able to walk.	Mana chayqa, manañam puriyta atiwaqchu.
And she’s a tough girl.	Hinaspa payqa sinchi sipasmi.
Or this time around.	Utaq kay kutipi.
That was some time ago.	Chayqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
Can you please tell me how to do it.	¿Atiwaqchu ama hina kaspa willaway imayna ruwanaypaq.
That is true in most cases.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim chiqap.
It’s a bad idea.	Mana allin yuyayniyuqmi.
The one with the most original ideas.	Aswan ñawpaq yuyayniyuq kaq.
And then again and again.	Hinaspa hukmanta hukmanta.
I know he can do it.	Yachanim chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
And it’s true.	Hinaspa chiqap.
Like home and all that.	Wasi hina chay tukuy ima.
He couldn’t speak at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas rimayta atirqanchu.
He looked very sad.	Payqa ancha llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
There was nothing today.	Kunan punchawqa manam imapas karqachu.
He is not alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kashan.
It looked rather interesting, and it was.	Aswan sumaqmi rikchakurqa, chaymi karqa.
No, something was terribly wrong.	Manan, imapas manchay mana allinchu karqan.
I still think about that often.	Chaypiqa kunankamapas sapa kutim piensani.
But one day you will know.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi yachanki.
I am, this time.	Ñuqaqa kani, kay kutipi.
You are always late.	Sapa kutim tarde kanki.
But it was just more, like, awesome.	Ichaqa chaylla karqan aswan, hina, manchay.
Maybe you should do the same.	Ichapas qampas chaynata ruwanayki.
It’s a beautiful thing.	Sumaq kaqmi.
But then again, who knows what happened.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ¿pitaq yachan imachus pasasqanmanta.
I am a happy person.	Kusisqa runam kani.
But, why is it? 	Ichaqa, ¿imarayku?
Now there was all the time in the world.	Kunanqa kay pachapi tukuy tiempo karqan.
Then, the third.	Chaymanta, kimsa kaq.
There’s a good chance everything will work out.	Allin chansa kan tukuy imapas allin kananpaq.
Yes, he will do it.	Arí, ruwanqa.
The last one is the actual date.	Qhipa kaqmi chiqap p’unchaw.
This moment, if you will.	Kay rato, munaspaqa.
Something like half an hour.	Imapas kuskan hora hina.
It’s good for you to say that.	Allinmi qampaq chayna rimayqa.
I’m not happy with it.	Manam kusisqachu kachkani.
I feel good tonight.	Kunan tutaqa allintam tarikuni.
I don’t know what’s going to happen now.	Manam yachanichu kunan imakuna pasananta.
He knew something was wrong, very wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas mana allin kashasqanmanta, ancha mana allin kashasqanmanta.
I really feel bad for you.	Chiqamanta mana allintachu sientekuni qampaq.
He doesn't know exactly what time it is.	Payqa manam allintachu yachan ima hora kasqanmantaqa.
This guy is really good.	Kay runaqa chiqap allinmi.
What's in it.	Imataq chaypi kachkan.
He wanted to tell her.	Willayta munarqa.
I'm in a ridiculous state.	Asikunapaq hinam kachkani.
They’re not there yet.	Manaraqmi chaypichu kanku.
But what is it.	Ichaqa imataq.
Handsome, athletic, popular.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq, pukllaq, ancha riqsisqa.
This can actually be a bad thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa mana allinmi kanman.
Who knows what the future holds?.	¿Pitaq yachan hamuq tiempopi imakuna kananta?.
Two, they’re stupid.	Iskay, paykunaqa sonso kanku.
Great for you!.	¡Hatun qampaq!.
But how can this be.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynataq kay kanman.
I can’t stop him anymore.	Manañam paytaqa manaña harkayta atiymanchu.
Don’t be stupid, don’t act out.	Ama sonso kaychu, ama hawapi ruwaychu.
I would be higher than that.	Ñoqaqa chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi kanman.
I still think about it a lot.	Kunankamapas anchatam chaypi piensani.
He can do a lot of things.	Achkatam ruwayta atin.
There it is again.	Chaypin yapamanta kashan.
But that is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu chay ruwasqanqa.
That can be a difficult task.	Chayqa sasa ruwaymi kanman.
It looks like a	Rikchakun huk .
But eventually .	Ichaqa qhepamanmi .
It certainly could have been easier.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan facil kanman karqan.
Everyone knows why.	Lliwmi yachanku imarayku chayna kasqanta.
Worse, he doesn't know what to do.	Aswan mana allinqa, manam yachanchu ima ruwananta.
There are some, whatever.	Kanmi wakin, imapas.
I don’t know what to say about that.	Manam yachanichu chaymanta ima niyta.
They're not bad, actually.	Paykunaqa manam mana allinchu kanku, chiqaptaqa.
I know something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yachani.
And he’s now with me to talk about it.	Hinaspa payqa kunan ñuqawan kuska chaymanta rimanaypaq.
That’s what he did, after all.	Chaytan ruwarqan, tukuy imamanta.
That’s kind of nice.	Chayqa huk laya sumaqmi.
I act quickly.	Utqayllam imatapas ruwani.
Now is the time for that.	Kunanmi chayna tiempo.
I would love to do it again.	Munaymanmi yapamanta ruwayta.
Thus he is by no means alone.	Chay hinaqa manan imapipas sapallanchu.
He looked at everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta qhawarisqa.
But worse than that.	Ichaqa chaymanta aswan mana allinqa.
More worried than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan llakisqa.
He does it well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwan.
I'm okay with that, if it's you.	Chaywanqa allinmi kachkani, qam kanki chayqa.
So, we have to do it.	Chaymi, ruwananchik tiyan.
That, and a few .	Chayqa, hinaspa huk iskay kimsa .
People with ideas, most of the time.	Yuyayniyuq runakuna, aswan achka kutipi.
And he did it himself.	Hinaspa pay kikin ruwarqa.
I’m sure he’s proud of you.	Seguro kani qanmanta orgulloso kasqanmanta.
He couldn’t sleep.	Mana puñuyta atirqachu.
Maybe something like that works for you.	Ichapas chayna imapas qampaq allin kanman.
He was a good, good man .	Payqa allin, allin runan karqan .
But he doesn’t want to tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta munanchu.
I wasn’t good at this.	Manam kaypi allintachu karqani.
He looked almost sad.	Yaqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
We can’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta atichwanchu.
He had always been alone.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi sapallan karqa.
Clearly, he meant nothing to her.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan imatapas paypaq niyta munarqanchu.
He couldn’t be that bad.	Payqa manan chay hina millay kayta atirqanchu.
We are happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa kayku.
We don’t disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopichu kayku.
Otherwise, I don’t know what to do.	Mana chayqa, manan yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
Less food, means more hunger.	Aswan pisi mikhuy, aswan yarqaymanta niyta munan.
He really was something.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin imapas karqan.
What he did was huge.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha hatunmi karqan.
But that will never happen.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa kanqachu.
That was a good thing he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa allinmi karqan.
It could have been tomorrow.	Paqarin kanman karqan.
You can’t be here.	Manam kaypi kayta atiwaqchu.
So they were in the hospital.	Chayraykum hospitalpi karqaku.
You’ve been here a long time.	Unayñam kaypi kachkanki.
Sounds like today.	Kunan punchaw hinam uyarikun.
Everyone was very happy including me, too.	Lliwmi ancha kusisqa karqaku ñuqapas, ñuqapas.
Do the right things.	Allin ruwaykunata ruway.
His daily routine was simple.	Sapa punchaw ruwasqanqa facilmi karqa.
Nothing is like that now.	Kunanqa manan imapas chay hinachu.
Otherwise, of course, he wouldn’t be there.	Mana chayqa, sut’inmi, mana chaypichu kanman.
So, he could go anywhere.	Chaymi, maymanpas riyta atinman karqa.
They were people.	Runakuna karqanku.
Yeah, sorry about that.	Arí, chaymanta pampachaykuway.
But he does it all the time.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi chayta ruwan.
Which was true, really true.	Imataq chiqap karqa, chiqap chiqap.
It wouldn’t have been easy.	Manam facilchu kanman karqa.
Probably a lot of things.	Yaqapaschá achka imakuna.
Insurance should be insurance.	Seguro nisqa seguro kanan.
He would love to talk.	Payqa anchatam munanman rimayta.
Isn’t it beautiful?.	¿Manachu sumaq?.
He knew he was there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta.
Or in another language.	Utaq huk simipi.
Beautiful looking, as always.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq, sapa kuti hina.
Now is the time!.	¡Kunanmi chay tiempo!.
That it should be there.	Chaypi kananta.
Good day to you.	Allin punchaw qampaq.
Every morning was bad.	Sapa paqarinmi mana allinchu karqa.
I want to hear this.	Kayta uyariyta munani.
I would rather not do it.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana ruwayqa.
In fact it’s all him.	Chiqaptaqa tukuy paymi.
This was a short time ago.	Kayqa karqan pisi tiempollamantan.
He was the best there.	Chaypiqa paymi aswan allinqa karqa.
I wish it was here.	Munaymanmi kaypi kanman.
But nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaymantaqa.
Terrible, terrible, terrible.	Manchay manchay manchay.
He says he would love to go.	Payqa anchatam munanman riyta nin.
However, this he did not do.	Ichaqa, kaytan mana ruwarqanchu.
I’m not a strong person.	Manam sinchi runachu kani.
No one knows exactly why.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan imarayku chaytaqa.
However, this was not the reality.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa cheqaqchu karqan.
I really can't solve this problem.	Chiqaptaqa manam kay sasachakuy allichayta atiymanchu.
He was obviously excited.	Sut’inmi payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
Everything was pretty good.	Tukuy imapas allin allinmi karqa.
That’s it for now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa.
Maybe it’s too fast.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla kasqanmanta.
Both are very difficult.	Iskayninkum ancha sasa.
He said that they were.	Payqa nirqam chayna kasqankuta.
You can’t focus on that.	Chaymanqa manam yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
They are all yours.	Llapallankum qampaq kanku.
Not always, of course.	Mana sapa kutichu, chiqamanta.
Yes it should be.	Arí chayna kanan tiyan.
And, it’s not funny.	Hinaspa, mana asikunapaq hinachu.
Oh, thank you.	Aw, gracias.
Maybe you want to be honest with him.	Ichapas paywan chiqap rimayta munanki.
This was not the first time.	Kayqa manam ñawpaq kutichu karqa.
So, these two are now like him or something.	Chaymi, kay iskay kunanqa pay hina utaq imapas.
What a child.	Ima wawa.
I was pretty sure of that.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa seguro karqani.
It cost me almost everything.	Yaqa tukuy imatam qullqita quwarqa.
But something else happened that day.	Ichaqa chay punchawmi huk imapas pasarqa.
He didn’t look right.	Payqa manan allintachu qhawarisqa.
Never too hungry.	Ama hayk’aqpas ancha yarqaymanta.
What are you doing now.	Imatataq kunan ruwanki.
After all, you did, once.	Tukuy imamanta, qam ruwarqanki, huk kuti.
I want to be this.	Munani kayta.
But, first things first.	Ichaqa, ñawpaq kaq imakuna ñawpaqta.
I'll go quickly.	Usqhaylla risaq.
The patient is severe.	Unqusqa sinchi.
He looked very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqam rikchakurqa.
It won’t come easy.	Manam facilchu hamunqa.
This is something unfamiliar to me.	Kayqa mana ñuqapaq riqsisqa kaqmi.
It looked sad now.	Kunanqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
No one could get away with it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa lluqsiyta atirqachu.
I didn't want to come so fast.	Manam chayna utqaylla hamuyta munarqanichu.
I did that, but not anymore.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manañam.
I know that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi yachani.
The sooner you take action, the better.	Aswan utqaylla ima ruwaytapas ruwanki chayqa, aswan allinmi.
It was very unreasonable of me.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa ñuqamanta.
Which looks good, actually.	Imataq allin rikchakun, chiqaptaqa.
It went well.	Allinmi rirqa.
What’s going on here? 	¿Imataq kaypi kachkan?
I really want to know why.	Chiqamanta yachayta munani imarayku.
She was as nervous as both of them.	Payqa iskayninku hinan mancharisqa kasharqan.
It’s more interesting, actually.	Aswan sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
That meant he wouldn't want to talk about it.	Chayqa niyta munarqa manam chaymanta rimayta munanmanchu.
There was never a chance.	Manam haykapipas chansa karqachu.
He can’t figure out what he wants.	Payqa manan yuyaymanayta atinchu ima munasqantapas.
It’s just terrible.	Chaylla manchay.
It is a continuing process.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwana.
He was probably a man like himself.	Payqa yaqapaschá pay hina runa karqan.
He doesn’t sound nervous.	Mana mancharisqa hinachu uyarikun.
That makes it really, really out there.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap hawapi ruwan.
But I’m so glad he did.	Ichaqa anchatan kusikuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Then three months.	Chaymanta kimsa killa.
He goes home.	Wasiman rin.
It is still a beautiful day.	Kunankamapas sumaq punchawmi.
I hope you can work things out.	Suyachkani imatapas allichayta atisqaykita.
A year ago, it wasn’t real.	Huk wata ñawpaqtaqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
Then do what you want.	Chaymanta ruway munasqaykita.
I was in trouble there.	Chaypim sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
He took him out.	Payta hurqurqa.
So it had to be all or nothing.	Chaymi llapan utaq mana imapas kanan karqa.
He is not up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu kashan.
This guy doesn’t exist.	Kay runaqa manam kanchu.
I don’t understand why, really.	Manam entiendenichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
He knew now what was wrong.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqa ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
He knows what is true.	Payqa yachanmi ima cheqaq kasqanta.
But there’s nothing of the sort here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan imapas chay hinaqa kanchu.
Everything is fine, everything is good.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, tukuy imapas allinmi.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispaymi yuyaykuni.
But not much yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi anchatachu.
You can’t say that.	Manan chaytaqa niyta atiwaqchu.
He didn’t travel much anymore, he said.	Manaña anchatachu puriq, nispas nin.
In fact, it was recent.	Aswanpas chayllaraqmi karqan.
That usually does it.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim chayta ruwan.
He started talking too much about being married.	Payqa casarasqa kasqanmantam llumpayta rimayta qallaykurqa.
I really wanted to eat it.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta mikhuyta munarqani.
She didn't need him.	Payqa manan paytaqa necesitarqanchu.
He was a known villain.	Payqa riqsisqa millay runam karqa.
It didn't matter about anything.	Manam imamantapas imananpaschu karqa.
He didn't really mean that.	Payqa manan allintachu chay hinata niyta munarqan.
He’s not alone in this, either.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kaypi, nitaq.
Which is the third big.	Imataq kimsa kaq hatun.
It’s very unpleasant.	Ancha mana sumaqmi.
You look amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi rikchakunki.
He couldn’t pretend not to.	Payqa manan mana hinachu ruwayta atirqanchu.
He did what he didn’t want to do.	Paymi mana munasqanta ruwarqa.
Go with me, guys.	Ñoqawan riy.
And then, you can’t give up.	Hinaspa chaymanta, mana saqiyta atiwaqchu.
He's very badly injured.	Payqa ancha sinchitan k'irisqa kashan.
Unfortunately, this had to happen.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa kanan karqa.
Good boy, one.	Allin wayna, huk.
He’s still very, very easy.	Payqa kunankamapas ancha, ancha facilmi.
Probably that’s all.	Yaqapaschá chaylla.
I'm not exactly sure where he's been recently.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi chayllaraq kasqanmanta.
I had to do something.	Imapas ruwanay karqa.
He looks very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam rikchakun.
We must do it right.	Allintam ruwananchik.
Strong as he is.	Pay hina sinchi.
You can't stop this.	Kaytaqa manam harkayta atiwaqchu.
I had to do it twice.	Iskay kutitam ruwanay karqa.
He’s a really good guy, you know.	Payqa chiqap allin runam, yachanki.
He still wants to.	Payqa hinallam munan.
Do what’s important.	Importante kaqta ruway.
There is nothing left, nothing.	Manañam imapas kanchu, manañam.
Seriously you are a wonderful person.	Serio qanmi kanki huk sumaq runa.
Not likely to be the case.	Manan chay hinachu kanman yaqapaschá.
You are a handsome man.	Qamqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runam kanki.
Just like today.	Imayna kunan punchaw hina.
He is nowhere to be found.	Payqa manan maypipas kanchu.
The next step will be the success itself.	Qatiqnin ruwayqa kanqa kikin allin ruwaymi.
All very nice people.	Tukuy ancha sumaq runakuna.
So he found himself with her.	Chaymi paywan kuska tarikurqa.
He was the second.	Paymi iskay kaq karqa.
That’s the whole world.	Chayqa tukuy kay pacha.
But now it makes no sense.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I couldn't bear to watch it.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu chayta qawayta.
Tom knew where he was.	Tomqa yacharqanmi maypi kasqanmanta.
What a day, what a day.	Ima punchaw, ima punchaw.
It was probably a child.	Yaqapaschá huk wawa karqa.
They were all good people.	Llapallankum allin runa karqaku.
But that was about a week ago.	Ichaqa yaqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi chayqa karqan.
You did very, very well.	Ancha ancha allintam ruwarqanki.
He wanted me to do better than him.	Payqa munarqanmi paymanta aswan allinta ruwanayta.
It may not always have been, but it is now.	Manapaschá sapa kutichu chayna karqa, kunanmi ichaqa chayna kachkan.
I know, he says.	Yachanim, nispas nin.
I want him to leave.	Munani pay ripunanpaq.
He was a player.	Payqa pukllaqmi karqan.
But it was too soon for me.	Ichaqa llumpay utqayllam ñuqapaq karqa.
You’ll be recognized here.	Kaypi riqsisqa kanki.
That was a very difficult thing to do.	Chayqa ancha sasam karqa.
I’m really scared, you know.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa kachkani, yachanki.
You and me, again.	Qampas ñuqapas, yapamanta.
Now he had no reason to.	Kunanqa manan imaraykupas chayta ruwanan karqanchu.
That’s my man.	Chayqa ñuqapa runa.
Learn to get there.	Chayman chayayta yachay.
You really did it.	Chiqaptam ruwarqanki.
I couldn’t let this happen.	Manam kay pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
But he was always there.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi chaypi kasharqan.
I don’t know anyone else.	Manam hukta riqsinichu.
I'm sure it was true this time.	Seguro kani kay kutipi chiqap kasqanmanta.
I'm really excited about it.	Chiqaptam chaywanqa ancha kusisqa kachkani.
He doesn’t mean anything by it.	Payqa manan chaywanqa imatapas niyta munanchu.
Unfortunately, he no longer exists.	Llakikuypaqmi manaña kanchu.
Of course, he was never much into it.	Arí, payqa manan hayk’aqpas anchatachu chaypiqa karqan.
I want to get out.	Lluqsiyta munani.
The teacher, however, was not happy.	Chay yachachiqmi ichaqa mana kusisqachu kasqa.
I'm still not sure.	Kunankamapas manam segurochu kani.
No, that statement may not be true.	Manan, chay rimayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu.
A few years ago, maybe longer.	Iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqta, ichapas aswan unayta.
You may not agree.	Manapaschá acuerdopichu kanki.
Now wouldn’t be the first time.	Kunanqa manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
It certainly would be.	Chiqaptam chayna kanman.
A man wants to be like himself.	Huk runaqa kikin hinam chayna runa kayta munan.
I don’t like that.	Chayqa manan gustanchu.
Perhaps you will too.	Yaqapaschá qampas.
I feel really good.	Chiqap allintam sientekuni.
He’s the youngest.	Payqa sullk’a kaqmi.
I didn’t think about it.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu.
Now, you probably want to be alone.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá sapallayki kayta munanki.
I don't want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu.
Yes, it will be very good.	Arí, ancha allinmi kanqa.
I didn’t expect it to be him.	Manam suyarqanichu pay kananta.
This was the first step here.	Kaypi kayqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi karqan.
But if you think about it, this is pointless.	Ichaqa chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kayqa.
He thinks he’s young, but he’s not.	Payqa wayna kananpaqmi yuyaykun, ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Twice, in fact.	Iskay kutita, chiqaptaqa.
But it probably was.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá karqan.
People here are cold and depressed.	Kaypi runakunaqa chiri, llakisqa ima kanku.
One problem after another.	Huk sasachakuymanta hukmanta.
It just wouldn’t be right.	Chaylla mana allinchu kanman.
Everyone was safe.	Lliwmi seguro karqaku.
But this way it’s okay.	Ichaqa kay hinaqa allinmi.
I feel a bit tired.	Huk chhikanta sayk’usqa sientekuni.
He couldn't believe he didn't want to.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu mana munasqanta.
Alone with him.	Paywan sapallan.
Yes, it’s unreasonable.	Arí, mana yuyayniyuqmi.
But it’s not what he wants.	Ichaqa manan munasqanman hinachu.
I don’t remember anything less than ten years ago.	Manaraq chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa imatapas yuyarinichu.
However, this is actually not always a good thing.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu kayqa allin.
I’m not really anything.	Manam chiqaptachu imapas kani.
That’s very unlike you.	Chayqa ancha mana qam hinachu.
I’ve always wanted it too much.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi llumpayta munarqani.
And then he's gone.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manañam kanchu.
It was, after all, a lonely day.	Chayqa, tukuy imamanta, sapallan p’unchawmi karqan.
I’d be angry.	Phiñasqa kayman.
I couldn’t stop coming.	Manam hamuyta saqiyta atirqanichu.
I’m smart with that.	Chaywanmi yachaysapa kani.
And, yes, that includes me.	Hinaspa, arí, chaypim ñuqapas kachkan.
And he did better with it.	Hinaspa payqa aswan allinta ruwarqa chaywan.
Please do tell me.	Ama hina kaspa, ruway willaway.
He is very difficult.	Payqa ancha sasam.
I know it was the right thing to do.	Yachanim chayna ruwasqanqa allin kasqanmanta.
But that one did.	Ichaqa chay hukninmi ruwarqa.
A very bad mistake.	Ancha millay pantasqa.
The truth is, he did.	Chiqap kaqmi, payqa chaytam ruwarqa.
He says things to her.	Payqa imakunatapas ninmi.
He was like an unreal person.	Mana chiqap runa hinam karqa.
You want to be safe.	Seguro kaytam munanki.
I want to know about it.	Chaymanta yachayta munani.
If it’s not a good one.	Mana allin kaptinqa.
Me, too, he said.	Ñoqapas, nispa.
Better to do something with it.	Aswan allinmi chaywan imatapas ruway.
I don’t know anything, anymore.	Manañam imatapas yachanichu, manañam.
He's pretty amazing, really.	Payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi, chiqaptapuni.
It would be better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi kanman.
I didn’t realize that at the time.	Chaytaqa manan chay tiempopiqa repararqanichu.
But it was after that.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi karqan.
He’s actually kind of nice.	Payqa chiqaptaqa huk laya sumaqmi.
I was, all right.	Ñuqaqa karqani, allinmi.
Home a few days ago.	Wasi iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqta.
What is three.	Imataq kimsa.
I knew what was going to happen that night.	Yacharqanim chay tuta imakuna pasananta.
I do that a lot.	Achkatam chayta ruwani.
I mean it’s mine.	Niyta munani ñuqapa kasqanmanta.
So go this weekend.	Chaymi kay semana tukuyta riy.
I never thought it would be easy.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chay ruwayqa facil kananta.
This wasn’t me.	Kayqa manam ñuqachu karqani.
He was very, very human.	Payqa ancha, ancha runam karqa.
With it was a letter.	Chaywanmi huk cartata kasqa.
I think these are amazing.	Kaykunaqa admirakuypaqmi nispam piensani.
I just didn’t know how.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynatachus chayta.
He looked at her blankly.	Payqa mana imatapas ruwaspa qhawarisqa.
You can't get there from here.	Kaymantaqa manam chaymanqa chayayta atiwaqchu.
It had been like that for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina kasqa.
And very nice indeed.	Hinaspa ancha sumaq chiqap.
Like he doesn’t think.	Mana yuyayniyuq hina.
That would have been a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman karqa.
They were sure it was too good.	Paykunaqa segurom karqaku llumpay allin kasqanmanta.
And say it.	Hinaspa niy.
I wanted to hear the good.	Allin kaqta uyariyta munarqani.
That it just happened.	Chaylla chayna pasasqanmanta.
More stupid than I am.	Aswan sonso ñuqamanta.
I don't think you can do anything else.	Manam piensanichu hukta ruwayta atisqaykita.
I don’t do them any other way.	Manan huk hinachu chaykunataqa ruwani.
It was a really hard day.	Chiqap sasa punchawmi karqa.
Maybe know everything about something.	Ichapas imamantapas tukuy imata yachay.
All of this doesn’t matter.	Tukuy kaykunaqa manam imananpaschu.
I would love to see it again.	Anchatan munani hukmanta rikuyta.
This is a milestone in this process.	Kayqa huk hatun ruwaymi kay ruwaypi.
People will be people.	Runakunaqa runakunam kanqa.
But these are no longer available.	Ichaqa kaykunaqa manañan kanchu.
But he was right.	Ichaqa allintan niwarqan.
The first one is wrong.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana allinchu.
That was about a week ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Not really looking forward to that.	Mana chiqaptachu chayta suyachkani.
Otherwise, they are fired.	Mana chayqa, qarqusqa kanku.
He is one of the most .	Payqa hukninmi aswan .
He told me to go home immediately.	Paymi niwarqa chaylla wasiyman rinaypaq.
That’s why he was so popular.	Chayraykum payqa ancha riqsisqa karqa.
It meant so much to be recognized by him.	Paymanta allinpaq qhawarisqa kayqa anchatan niyta munarqan.
Every day but today was good.	Sapa punchawmi ichaqa kunan punchawmi allin karqa.
Maybe you don’t want to hear that.	Ichapas chayta mana uyariyta munankichu.
Now, .	Kunanqa, .
If not, you’ll find out soon enough.	Mana chayqa, usqhayllan yachanki.
That’s what he always was.	Chayqa payqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
I still really want to work.	Kunankamapas anchatam llamkayta munani.
Surely he would have done it now, but he didn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa ruwanman karqan, ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
You can do the following steps.	Kay ruwaykunata ruwawaq.
She’s a party girl.	Payqa fiestapi sipasmi.
It did the job well.	Chayqa allintam chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
But this doesn’t ring true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu kayqa uyarikun.
That was really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
He wanted to leave, she told me.	Payqa ripuyta munarqa, nispas niwarqa.
And he looked at it.	Hinaspa chayta qhawarirqan.
He was very happy, he said.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa, nispa.
Don’t do it any other way.	Ama huk hinata ruwaychu.
But something isn’t right.	Ichaqa imapas manam allinchu.
I thought maybe you knew.	Yuyarqanim ichapas yachasqaykita.
He stayed fine for the next three months.	Payqa kinsa killa qhepamanmi allinta qhepakurqan.
He seemed almost sad.	Yaqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
But tell me about it.	Ichaqa chaymanta willaway.
The important thing is, the right people were here.	Importante kaqmi, allin runakuna kaypi karqaku.
Hopefully that means something to you.	Munaymanmi chayqa imapas qampaq niyta munan.
With that, you do that.	Chaywanqa, chayta ruwanki.
It was good, very good.	Allinmi karqa, ancha allinmi karqa.
But the teenager did it.	Ichaqa chay wayna sipasmi chayta ruwarqan.
Not two nights.	Mana iskay tuta.
He was not to be alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kanan karqan.
But they want to.	Ichaqa munanku.
That’s probably the next best thing.	Chayqa ichapas qatiqnin aswan allin kaq.
But he learns quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan yachan.
I want him, yes.	Paytaqa munani, arí.
I felt like the only person.	Chaylla runa hinam tarikurqani.
They are ambivalent.	Paykunaqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
It looked as good as new.	Musuq hina allinmi rikchakurqa.
I do that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwani.
She had no intention of going anywhere with him.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu paywan kuska maymanpas riyta.
Maybe I can do this.	Ichapas kayta ruwayman.
That’s why they were all there.	Chayraykum llapallanku chaypi karqaku.
It was difficult about this.	Kaymantaqa sasa karqa.
He will probably do it.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanqa.
He’s good at that.	Payqa allinmi chayna.
But he knows it won’t come.	Ichaqa yachanmi mana hamunanta.
This again is absurd.	Kayqa yapamanta mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I really wish you were harder.	Chiqaptam munani aswan sasa kanaykita.
He went through it all right.	Chaytaqa allintam pasarqa.
I can talk there.	Chaypi rimayta atiyman.
He'll do it tomorrow.	Paqarinmi ruwanqa.
Surely someone knew about this.	Cheqaqtapunin pipas kaymanta yacharqan.
He knew it was true.	Payqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kasqanta.
So there’s a big reason why.	Chaymi kan hatun imarayku.
I couldn't think of anything that night.	Chay tutaqa manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
Now, however, he was afraid.	Kunanmi ichaqa mancharisqa kasqa.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
But that seems to be the case.	Ichaqa chayqa kanman hinan.
No one would ever want it after all.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas munanmanchu tukuy imamantapas.
I think there is a great truth here.	Kaypiqa hatun chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
I tried again and again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta yapamanta kallpanchakurqani.
He always did the right thing.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi allin kaqta ruwaq.
Ten days late.	Chunka punchaw tarde.
It can really go away.	Chiqamanta ripuyta atin.
Out of town, not so much.	Llaqtamanta hawapi, mana anchatachu.
I know you are in a very difficult situation.	Yachanim ancha sasachakuypi kasqaykita.
I want to talk to him now.	Kunanmi paywan rimayta munani.
Maybe it’s me.	Ichapas ñuqaqa kanman.
I think that will be great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanqa nispam piensani.
He went with me.	Paymi ñuqawan rirqa.
Seriously, it just happened.	Serio, chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
I'm not sure why this happened.	Manam segurochu kani imanasqa kay pasasqanmanta.
He is no longer good.	Payqa manañam allinchu.
I am from nowhere.	Ñuqaqa mana maypipas kasqanmantam kani.
It was a month of learning.	Yachay killa karqan.
It was everything that night.	Chay tutaqa tukuy imapas kasqa.
It’s not like you.	Manan qan hinachu.
One day, maybe.	Huk punchaw, ichapas.
Do whatever you want with me.	Ruway munasqaykita ñuqawan.
You may not know much about something.	Imamantapas manapaschá anchatachu yachanki.
What is the	Imataq chay .
It was difficult to speak.	Sasam karqa rimayqa.
It’s the latter kind of thing.	Chayqa qhipa kaq laya kaqmi.
I still feel bad about that.	Chaywanqa kunankamapas mana allintam sientekuni.
If it’s true, that is.	Sichus cheqaq kanman chayqa, chaymi.
He should do this regularly.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwanan.
I am smarter than all of them.	Llapallankum aswan yachaysapa kani.
He is a wicked man.	Payqa millay runam.
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa nispa.
I really really want to say that.	Anchatam anchata munani chayta niyta.
If you don’t want to go there.	Mana chayman riyta munaspaqa.
Go if you want to.	Munaspaqa riy.
No one can stop it.	Manan pipas chaytaqa hark'ayta atinmanchu.
All goodness came out of it.	Tukuy allin kaymi chaymanta lluqsirqa.
But he was very instructive.	Ichaqa ancha yachachiqmi karqa.
It’s still true of me, actually.	Hinallam chiqap ñuqamanta, chiqaptaqa.
I think it’s going to be out there for a while.	Yuyaykuni huk rato hawapi kananta.
Now he knows you’re there.	Kunanqa yachanmi chaypi kasqaykita.
He opened it up.	Chayta kicharirqa.
Repetition is important.	Yapamanta rimayqa ancha allinmi.
He said he would be back soon.	Chaylla kutimunanta nirqa.
But it certainly was.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
He was always uncomfortable, always tired.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allinchu karqa, sapa kutim sayk’usqa karqa.
He had never done that before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu ñawpaqtaqa.
That’s not a difficult thing.	Chayqa manam sasachu.
Unfortunately he was too big.	Llakikuypaqmi payqa ancha hatun karqa.
He looks very bad.	Payqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
He was in the house for two weeks.	Payqa iskay semanan chay wasipi kasharqan.
It seemed so long ago.	Chayna unayñam rikchakurqa.
He had a good day.	Payqa allin punchawmi karqa.
And he could be mean.	Hinaspa payqa millay kayta atinman karqan.
Whatever you want.	Imatachus munanki.
And then, they were together at that time.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chay pacha kuska karqanku.
But that wasn’t the only hidden treasure.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu pakasqa qhapaq kayqa karqan.
They are almost	Paykunaqa yaqa .
We need to do it more often.	Aswan sapa kutim ruwananchik.
No one is here, he said.	Mana pipas kaypichu, nispa.
Maybe it will be.	Ichapas kanqa.
I will always be there to help.	Sapa kutim chaypi kasaq yanapanaypaq.
If you don't, someone else might.	Mana chayta ruwaptikiqa huk runam ruwanman.
Truth be told it seemed very good.	Chiqap rimayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
I didn’t want to do it either.	Ñuqapas manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
They are depressed people.	Paykunaqa llakisqa runakunam kanku.
I’m not quite there yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu chaypi kachkani.
So, it was great.	Chayna, ancha allinmi karqa.
There was one of them.	Hukninmi kasqa.
Great, great, great player.	Hatun, hatun, hatun pukllaq.
Sounds like a good thing.	Allin kaq hinam uyarikun.
I was really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqani.
It's ready to go to its new home.	Musuq wasinman rinanpaq listoña kachkan.
Yes it is not good.	Arí mana allinmi.
I want you to be unhappy.	Mana kusisqa kanaykita munani.
This is a daily routine.	Kayqa sapa punchawmi sapa punchaw ruway.
But I’ll be fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kasaq.
I’m angry with you.	Ñuqaqa phiñasqa kani.
It was really quick.	Chiqaptam utqaylla karqa.
I just have to do it.	Chaylla ruwanay tiyan.
It’s not that easy.	Mana chayna facilchu.
In fact, it should be soon.	Chiqaptaqa, chayllaraqmi kanan.
He seemed unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqa hinam karqa.
We did it several times very well.	Achka kutitam ruwarqayku ancha allinta.
I want to look pretty.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq kaytam munani.
He is tired but happy.	Payqa sayk’usqa ichaqa kusisqan kashan.
He didn’t seem worried.	Payqa manan llakisqa hinachu karqan.
The adults were terrified.	Kuraq runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
Good night to you.	Allin tuta qanpaq.
He wasn’t alone in his insecurities.	Payqa manan sapallanchu mana seguro kasharqan.
The responsibility is enormous.	Chay ruwayqa ancha hatunmi.
So far, he has nothing to say about it.	Kunankamaqa manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta munanchu.
No one wants that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa munanchu.
Instead, it will be.	Aswanpas kanqa.
Less evil.	Aswan pisi millay.
Couldn't sleep much afterwards.	Mana anchata puñuyta atirqachu chaymanta.
But for now, he will do well.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa allintam ruwanqa.
They were half too popular.	Paykunaqa kuskan ancha allin qhawarisqa karqanku.
Have a nice year.	Sumaq wata.
There are a lot of great people here.	Kaypiqa achka hatun runakunam kachkan.
And he wants her back here.	Hinaspa kayman kutimunanta munan.
He said yes, that's right.	Payqa arí, chaytam nirqa.
Yes, the man.	Arí, chay runa.
I’m a very big guy.	Ancha hatunmi kani.
But you probably think so.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yuyaykunki.
I wanted him there.	Chaypim payta munarqani.
Something about you.	Imapas qammanta.
Don’t do too much, too fast.	Ama anchata, ancha utqaylla ruwaychu.
He couldn’t do that again.	Chaytaqa manañan hukmanta ruwayta atirqanchu.
But they’re not.	Ichaqa paykunaqa.
They were last year.	Paykunaqa qayna wata karqanku.
And he’s angry.	Hinaspa payqa phiñasqa kashan.
And if not him, then someone else, some unknown.	Hinaspa mana pay kaptinqa, chaymanta huk runa, wakin mana riqsisqa.
I was the first one to be there.	Ñuqam puntata chaypi kaq karqani.
In fact, he couldn't wait.	Chiqaptaqa, manam suyayta atirqachu.
I don’t know where yet.	Manaraq maypi yachanichu.
I immediately said yes.	Chayllam arí nirqani.
As a result, you will become even more frustrated.	Chayraykum astawan hukmanyasqa kanki.
A couple of times.	Huk iskay kutita.
I didn’t want to say it anymore.	Manañam niyta munarqanichu.
It really should be better.	Chiqaptam aswan allin kanan.
I know exactly how that feels.	Allintam yachani imayna chayna kasqanmanta.
They were no happier than they had been the first time.	Paykunaqa manan aswan kusisqachu karqanku ñawpaq kutipi hinaqa.
You weren’t here that morning.	Chay paqarinmi mana kaypichu karqanki.
He wouldn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munanmanchu.
This is quick.	Kayqa utqaylla.
Everything is all over the place.	Tukuy imapas lliwmi kachkan.
That seems absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam.
Future time, now .	Hamuq tiempo, kunan .
He wanted things.	Payqa imakunatapas munarqanmi.
Everyone knows they are ridiculous.	Lliwmi yachanku asikunapaq hina kasqankuta.
Yes, that’s what he said.	Arí, chaytam nirqa.
All together now.	Llapallanku kuska kunan.
I wasn’t too sure about anything.	Manam anchatachu imamantapas seguro karqani.
This is the whole problem.	Kaymi llapan sasachakuy.
They are very intelligent people.	Paykunaqa ancha yachaysapa runakunam kanku.
I could have been there all along.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi kayman karqan.
Black told me who you were.	Yana niwarqa pi kasqaykita.
Like everyone else.	Llapa runa hina.
What a tragedy that would be.	Ima llakikuypaqmi chayqa kanman.
He was alone here.	Kaypiqa sapallanmi karqa.
Man is hungry all day long.	Runaqa tukuy punchawmi yarqasqa kachkan.
Both were depressed.	Iskayninkum llakisqa karqaku.
This isn’t me! 	¡Kayqa manam ñuqachu!
Tell me how that happened.	Willaway imaynataq chay pasasqanmanta.
It will be fine later.	Qhepamanmi allin kanqa.
You don’t want that to happen.	Manam munankichu chayna kananta.
He thought it was quick.	Payqa usqhayllan kananpaq yuyaykurqan.
I don’t think so, anyway.	Manam yuyanichu, imayna kaptinpas.
In fact, it is very large.	Aswanpas ancha hatunmi.
This he knew very well.	Kayqa ancha allintam yacharqa.
Now he could do as he pleased, as he pleased.	Kunanqa munasqanman hina ruwayta atinman karqan, munasqanman hina.
But, everything is fine.	Ichaqa, tukuy imapas allinmi.
As good as ever.	Ñawpaq hina allin.
I can’t say more about that.	Mana chaymanta astawan rimayta atinichu.
But he refused to listen to it.	Ichaqa manan chayta uyariyta munarqanchu.
He knows when it will happen.	Payqa yachanmi haykapi pasananta.
I would love for someone to do that.	Anchatan munani pipas chayta ruwananta.
No future, no past.	Mana hamuq pacha, mana ñawpaq.
That was always really nice.	Chayqa sapa kutim chiqap sumaq karqa.
He will always come.	Payqa sapa kutim hamunqa.
Don’t do too much, too fast.	Ama llumpayta ruwaychu, llumpay utqaylla.
The other man, however, was in a hurry.	Huknin runaqa ichaqa usqhayllan kasqa.
He was the first person to do something.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq runa imatapas ruwarqa.
There is, always.	Kanmi, sapa kuti.
Of course it would be.	Chiqamanta chayqa kanman.
For what he is doing now.	Kunan ruwasqanmanta.
And boy did it ever work.	Hinaspa wayna ruwarqan hayk’aqpas llank’ayta.
Everyone is either bad, or happy.	Lliwmi icha mana allinchu, utaq kusisqa.
That has never happened before.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
There is no yesterday.	Qayna punchawqa manam kanchu.
That can be hard to do on your own.	Chayqa sasa kanman sapallayki ruwayqa.
He needs help big time.	Payqa necesitan yanapayta hatun tiempo.
Perhaps you have done so.	Ichapas qampas chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
He wanted it to happen.	Payqa munarqanmi chayna kananta.
Lots of coffee.	Achka kukata.
Indeed he was.	Chiqaptam pay karqa.
I’ll do that again.	Chayta yapamanta ruwasaq.
It certainly can.	Chiqamanta atin.
I often feel that way.	Chaynatam achka kutipi tarikuni.
No, it’s not a bad thing.	Manan, manan mana allinchu.
Okay, here’s how to do it.	Allinmi, kaypi imayna ruwana.
This is the right thing to do.	Kaymi allin ruwayqa.
Not only that, you’re not good enough.	Mana chayllachu, mana allinchu kanki.
Almost say.	Yaqa niy.
They are a treasure.	Paykunaqa huk qhapaq kaymi.
I want to see him happy.	Payta kusisqa rikuyta munani.
You’re not a bad guy.	Manam mana allinchu kanki.
You know you don’t have to do home improvements.	Yachanki mana wasi allichayta ruwanaykita.
Go there, guys.	Chayman riy.
They have always been there.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi karqaku.
He told me he needed the money.	Paymi niwarqa chay qullqita necesitasqanmanta.
Of course, it doesn’t always work.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwan.
He looked unconcerned.	Payqa mana llakisqa qhawarisqa.
But it probably isn’t.	Ichaqa manapaschá hinachu.
This is no longer the case.	Manañan chay hinachu kayqa.
It doesn't seem like a big deal.	Manam hatun hinachu rikchakun.
I don’t agree with that statement.	Chay nisqanqa manan acuerdopichu kani.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus paywan pasasqanmanta.
Maybe you don’t want to talk.	Ichapas mana rimayta munankichu.
I’d better go.	Aswan allinmi risaq.
The wicked know this.	Chaytaqa millay runakunam yachanku.
But it may not be enough.	Ichaqa manapaschá chayllachu kanman.
It would be great to talk for a while.	Ancha allinmi kanman huk rato rimayqa.
Unfortunately, this is the reality.	Llakikuypaqmi, kaymi cheqaq kaq.
You can’t go there.	Chaymanqa manam riyta atiwaqchu.
But it was going to be a beautiful day.	Ichaqa sumaq p’unchaymi kanan karqan.
The process is much easier.	Chay ruwayqa aswan facilmi.
The second person.	Iskay kaq runa.
And then that all went away.	Hinaspa chaymanta chay tukuy ripurqan.
I barely heard him.	Yaqapaschá paytaqa mana uyarirqanichu.
This was such a moment.	Kayqa chhayna rato karqan.
I feel better every day.	Sapa punchawmi allinta sientekuni.
It makes about as much sense as anything else.	Yaqa imapas hina yuyayniyuqmi.
We are fine here.	Kaypiqa allintam kachkaniku.
I know it's stupid of me.	Yachanim ñuqamanta sonso kasqanmanta.
Those people want to talk.	Chay runakunaqa rimayta munanku.
The future is secure.	Hamuq pacha seguro.
I mean, we did that.	Niyta munani, chayta ruwarqayku.
They want it all tomorrow.	Paqarinmi tukuy chayta munanku.
It was nice to talk to him.	Paywan rimayqa sumaqmi karqa.
A week, maybe sooner.	Huk semana, ichapas aswan utqaylla.
With it, he does what he wants.	Chaywanqa munasqanman hinam ruwan.
That’s all it means.	Chaylla niyta munan.
You need to make a play here.	Kaypi huk pukllayta ruwanayki tiyan.
No, actually.	Manam, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe a few months.	Ichapas iskay kimsa killa.
And after all.	Hinaspa tukuy imamanta.
That was really going to happen.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kanan karqan.
And, yes, it’s beautiful.	Hinaspa, arí, sumaq.
He knew immediately who it was.	Payqa chayllam yacharqa pi kasqanmanta.
There he was depressed.	Chaypi llakisqa tarikurqa.
It’s obviously too fast.	Sut’inmi ancha utqaylla.
It won’t always happen.	Manam sapa kutichu kanqa.
Anyway, that was here.	Imayna kaptinpas, chayqa kaypim karqa.
Strong man, very proud.	Sinchi runa, ancha orgulloso.
He’s really nice to me.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi ñuqapaq.
Better he’s there than me.	Aswan allin paymi chaypi ñoqamanta.
Was it always.	¿Sapa kutichu karqan.
That may be a problem.	Chayqa ichapas huk sasachakuy kanman.
They were all great walkers.	Llapallankum hatun puriq runakuna karqaku.
He waits for the opportunity.	Payqa suyanmi chay oportunidadta.
That would be foolish.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kanman.
But it takes money.	Ichaqa qolqetan necesitan.
I had no one to talk to.	Manam piwanpas rimanaypaq karqachu.
I was excited, anxious and ready.	Kusisqa, llakisqa, listo ima karqani.
I never wanted to anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam haykapipas munarqanichu.
There was no point in being sick.	Unqusqa kayqa manam imapaqpas karqachu.
I mean everything.	Tukuy niyta munani.
He was a very famous man.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa runam karqa.

John seemed happier.	Juanqa aswan kusisqa hinam karqa.
Don’t do that.	Mana chaynatachu ruway.
There is nothing like it anywhere else.	Manan maypipas chay hinaqa kanchu.
They seemed happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska kusisqa hinam karqaku.
He was sick of it, actually.	Payqa chaymanta unqusqa karqa, chiqaptaqa.
Bad, bad looking.	Mana allin, mana allin rikchayniyuq.
They are constant so far.	Paykunaqa kunankamaqa sapa kutim kanku.
Yes, he knows a lot.	Arí, payqa achkatam yachan.
John a short time ago.	Juanqa pisi tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi.
That’s what came out of it.	Chayqa chaymanta lluqsirqa.
He was the first to do so.	Paymi ñawpaqta chayta ruwarqan.
Maybe they were, there.	Ichapas paykunaqa karqaku, chaypi.
Where the good people.	Maypichus allin runakunaqa.
I think there is someone in the house.	Wasipi pipas kasqanmantam piensani.
I’m not quite sure who this one is.	Manam allintachu yachani pi kay huknin kasqanmanta.
It is the largest in the world.	Chayqa kay pachapi aswan hatunmi.
I’ve always wanted to eat one.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi hukta mikhuyta munarqani.
He wasn't quite sure what he was thinking.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
I think there’s something out there.	Yuyaykuni chay hawapi imapas kasqanmanta.
I’m obviously very tired.	Sut’inmi ancha sayk’usqa kashani.
If he is guilty.	Sichus huchayoq kanman chayqa.
You really, really can’t.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana atiwaqchu.
Maybe he wanted it too much too soon.	Ichapas payqa llumpayta llumpay utqaylla munarqa.
It’s all out there.	Tukuy chay hawapi kachkan.
It is readily available.	Chayqa chayllam tarikun.
How can you make it better.	¿Imaynatataq aswan allinta ruwawaq.
So here is what happened.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan imakuna pasasqanmanta.
It’s more obvious.	Aswan sut’inmi.
You know, that’s huge.	Yachanki, chayqa hatunmi.
But this guy was good.	Ichaqa kay runaqa allinmi kasqa.
Maybe something happened to him.	Ichapas imapas paywan pasarqa.

He can’t be happy.	Payqa manan kusisqa kayta atinchu.
He would be the real thing.	Payqa cheqaq kaqmi kanman.
He had no idea what such a thing was like.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chhayna ruway imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Better this thing.	Aswan allinmi kay imapas.
But he was lucky.	Ichaqa suerteyoqmi kasqa.
I repeated the process.	Chay ruwayta yapamanta ruwarqani.
But that is always a set-up.	Ichaqa chayqa sapa kutillanmi churasqa kashan.
A half-truth, perhaps.	Huk kuskan chiqap, ichapas.
I know where everything is though.	Yachanim maypi tukuy imapas kasqanmanta ichaqa.
Anyway, that's it.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymi.
That is, over and over again.	Chayqa, kuti kutita.
I couldn’t wait any longer.	Manam aswan suyayta atirqanichu.
That would be pretty amazing.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi kanman.

I didn’t expect it to happen again, but why not.	Manam suyarqanichu hukmanta chayna kananta, ichaqa imanasqataq mana.
I’ve seen a lot of it.	Achkatam rikurqani.
There, you always fail.	Chaypiqa, sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwanki.
That was about two decades ago.	Chayqa yaqa iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
You can't ignore that.	Chaytaqa manam mana uyariyta atiwaqchu.

Not me anyway.	Mana ñuqa imayna kaptinpas.
And this is as it should be.	Hinaspa kayqa imayna kanan hinam.
More, more, more.	Aswan, aswan, aswan.
First of all, the weather.	Ñawpaqtaqa pacha.
Perhaps, yes.	Ichapas, arí.
And then there are people.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanmi runakuna.
I wonder why he’s here.	Tapukuni imaraykutaq kaypi kachkan.
I really wanted to be with you.	Ñoqaqa anchatan munarqani qanwan kuska kayta.
The person will be dismissed.	Chay runaqa qarqusqa kanqa.
Less food.	Pisi mikhuy.
You won’t be here long.	Mana unaytachu kaypi kanki.
But that is out of the question here.	Ichaqa chaymanta rimayqa manan kaypiqa kanchu.
He always said that.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chay hinata rimaq.
I feel so lucky to be a part of it.	Ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni chaymanta huknin kasqaymanta.
So do it.	Chaymi ruway.
There is nothing like a good man.	Manam imapas kanchu allin runa hinaqa.
You had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki karqan.
It’s not good at anything.	Manan imapipas allinchu.
This is the best part of the process.	Kaymi chay ruwaypi aswan allin ruway.
Not bad, at all.	Mana mana allinchu, ni imapipas.
I can't fix this.	Kaytaqa manam allichayta atiymanchu.
Don’t make a big deal of it.	Ama hatun ruwaytaqa ruwaychu.
Yes, he had to do it.	Arí, chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
That’s probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayna.
He really wanted to know.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa yachayta munarqan.
I need more of that.	Astawan chaymanta necesitasaq.
He will do everything he has to do.	Paymi tukuy ima ruwananta ruwanqa.
It was all so very sad.	Tukuy chayna ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He made her leave.	Ripunanpaq ruwarqa.
It’s really easy to do this.	Chiqamanta kayta ruwayqa facilmi.
The people of the city were not happy.	Chay llaqtapi runakunaqa manam kusisqachu karqaku.
At the end of everything.	Tukuy ima tukukuypi.
That was less than a month ago.	Chayqa karqan manaraq huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
He will come this afternoon, at two o'clock.	Payqa kunan tarde hamunqa, iskay horasta.
I wasn’t sure what he was going to do.	Manam segurochu karqani ima ruwananmanta.
About a month.	Yaqa huk killa.
If so, the	Chayna kaptinqa, .
He wasn't sure how he felt about this.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan kaymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.
This is obviously a daily occurrence.	Kayqa sut’inmi sapa p’unchay ruway.
He couldn't do it, he couldn't do it.	Payqa manam ruwayta atirqachu, manam ruwayta atirqachu.
Not sure if it's good or not.	Mana segurochu sichus allinchu mana.
But we’re not so sure.	Ichaqa manan chay hina segurochu kayku.

Just in time as always.	Sapa kuti hina tiempollanpi.
He no longer seemed frightened or angry.	Manaña mancharisqa nitaq phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
He was not alone in this.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwarqan.
If you know it.	Yachanki chayqa.
That’s all they are.	Chayllam paykunaqa kanku.
It wouldn’t be right for you.	Manam qampaq allinchu kanman.
That’s not true though.	Chayqa manan cheqaqchu ichaqa.
But no one knew where he was.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
He wasn't sure why, but .	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta, ichaqa .
It was almost funny.	Yaqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
A nightclub.	Huk tuta wasi.
He was the best of the best.	Payqa aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
He cannot be fired.	Payqa manam qarqusqa kayta atinchu.
There is some uncertainty.	Wakin mana seguro kaymi kan.
He is the bad guy.	Paymi mana allin runa.
It was cold, indeed.	Chiri, chiqamanta karqa.
Forgive me, baby.	Pampachaykuway wawa.
But it wasn’t quite big enough.	Ichaqa manan allintachu hatun karqan.
It’s always in the morning.	Sapa kutim tutamanta.

You are a very strong person.	Qamqa ancha sinchi runam kanki.
Nothing else really.	Mana imapas huk chiqaptaqa.
I don’t understand him.	Manam paytaqa entiendenichu.
But everything else though.	Ichaqa tukuy ima ichaqa.
Perhaps he wished he hadn't.	Yaqapaschá mana chayta ruwananta munarqa.
However, this certainly wasn’t it.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin mana kaychu karqan.
Anyone, anyway.	Pipas, imayna kaptinpas.
But he knew he was good in trouble.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi sasachakuypi allin kashasqanmanta.
He was pathetic.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He speaks quickly.	Payqa utqayllam riman.
So he can’t go for a walk.	Chaymi mana puriq riyta atinmanchu.
He was the best at it anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas chaypiqa aswan allinmi karqa.
He didn’t get it right.	Payqa manan allintachu hap’isqa.
Is that the right thing to do? 	¿Chaytachu?
I want to get out of me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqamanta lluqsiyta munani.
Why it should be, he had no idea.	Imaraykutaq chayna kanan, manas ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
He must be here somewhere.	Payqa maypipas kaypi kanan.
I wonder why?.	Tapukuni imarayku?.
Worse, worse, worse.	Aswan mana allin, aswan mana allin, aswan mana allin.
But I don’t feel like it.	Ichaqa manan chayman hinachu sientekuni.
That’s all he says.	Chayllam nin.
Yes, tell me about it.	Arí, chaymanta willaway.
You can tell he is a very nice person.	Ancha sumaq runa kasqanmantam yachanki.
That’s what he should be.	Chaytan payqa kanan.
It had to be him, no one else.	Paymi kanan karqan, manan pipas.
He was one of them.	Payqa hukninmi karqa.
He did well and that was good.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa chaymi allin karqa.
Not like yesterday.	Mana qayna punchaw hinachu.
And it just came out.	Hinaspa chayllaraq lluqsirqa.
Now I wonder who lives there.	Kunanqa pikuna chaypi tiyan chayta tapukuni.
I don't think it will happen any time soon.	Manam piensanichu chaylla pasananta.
More intensely than that.	Chaymanta aswan sinchita.
That was almost ridiculously easy.	Chayqa yaqa asikunapaq hina facilmi karqa.
That's the worst day ever.	Chayqa aswan mana allin p'unchawmi.

And all, will be good in the end.	Hinaspa llapan, tukukuypi allin kanqa.
It was always both.	Sapa kutim iskayninku karqaku.
You are the truth.	Qanmi kanki cheqaq kaq.
Without it there really is nothing.	Mana chaywanqa chiqaptaqa manam imapas kanchu.
And then he said, thank you.	Hinaspa chaymanta nisqa, gracias nispa.
Yes, it’s bigger now.	Arí, kunanqa aswan hatunmi.
But, no, he couldn’t tell.	Ichaqa, manan, manan willayta atirqanchu.
There is something very singular here.	Kaypiqa imapas ancha sapallanmi kachkan.
What is your .	Imataq qampaq .
This one went badly.	Kayqa mana allintachu rirqa.
And do it wrong.	Hinaspa mana allinta ruway.
He was the set up.	Payqa chay churasqa karqan.
And he said, All is well.	Hinan payqa nirqan: Allinmi, nispa.
Everybody knows about it, everybody.	Lliwmi chaymanta yachanku, llapallanku.
Nobody talks about it much.	Manan pipas anchatachu riman.
I certainly disagree.	Cheqaqtapunin mana acuerdopichu kani.
I couldn’t imagine why that would happen.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imanasqa chayna kananta.
I would never be ready.	Manam haykapipas listochu kayman.
He didn’t know how long it would take.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a tiempo chay ruway kananta.
I want to be recognized.	Munani riqsisqa kayta.
I no longer get the error message.	Manañam pantasqa willayta tarinichu.
This is in no way right or true.	Kayqa manan imapipas allinchu nitaq cheqaqchu.
But this remained.	Ichaqa kaymi qhepakurqan.
You know why that is.	Yachankim imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But there is still something going on.	Ichaqa hinallam imapas kachkan.
Why not, of course.	Imaraykutaq mana, chiqamanta.
Make a coin.	Huk qullqita ruway.
It is not worth anything	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​.
It’s not like anything should be.	Mana imapas kanan hinachu.
He did these things immediately.	Chaykunataqa chaylla ruwarqa.
He is eager to help.	Payqa anchatam yanapayta munan.
I feel so good, actually.	Ancha allintam tarikuni, chiqaptaqa.
They were great about it.	Paykunaqa chaymantaqa ancha allinmi karqaku.
What is everyone.	Imataq llapa runa.
He can’t do it alone.	Mana sapallan ruwayta atinchu.
The man seemed to be in good spirits.	Chay runaqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
I want to capture the truth.	Chiqap kaqta hapiyta munani.
So far, it hasn’t.	Kunankamaqa manam.
I wasn’t immediately surprised.	Manam chayllachu admirakurqani.
Then I’ll do that.	Chaymantam chayta ruwasaq.
No he’s never alone.	Mana mana hayk’aqpas sapallanchu.
And then, the greatest man in the world.	Hinaspa chaymanta, kay pachapi aswan hatun runa.
He couldn't remember anything.	Payqa manam imatapas yuyariyta atirqachu.
It’s such a sad thing.	Chayna llakikuypaqmi.
We are fine with that.	Chaywanqa allintam kachkaniku.
So it’s almost instantaneous.	Chaymi yaqa chaylla.

Now there is no one.	Kunanqa manam pipas kanchu.
Maybe he didn’t do it right.	Ichapas mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He vehemently refused.	Payqa sinchitan mana munarqanchu.
If not specified.	Mana nisqa kaptinqa.
There is always a nice crowd.	Sapa kutim sumaq achka runakuna kan.
Nothing is that simple.	Manan imapas chay hina facilchu.
I think he made a mistake there.	Chaypi pantasqa kasqanmantam piensani.
What’s wrong with that.	Imataq mana allinchu chaypi.
If anything, it was too serious.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, nishuta serio karqan.
He was so happy today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha kusisqa karqa.
It wasn’t bad at all.	Manam mana allinchu karqa ni imapipas.
The speech is good.	Rimayqa allinmi.
I just know that the truth is good.	Chaylla yachani cheqaq kaq allin kasqanta.
I was there that morning.	Chay paqarinmi chaypi karqani.
Learn, again and again.	Yachay, yapamanta yapamanta.
She looks great today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq.
He knew you were in trouble.	Payqa yacharqanmi sasachakuypi kasqaykita.
Maybe it’s for you.	Ichapas qampaq.
Not which way.	Mana mayqin ñanta.
If he wanted to know, that’s fine.	Sichus yachayta munarqan chayqa, allinmi.
No one ever needed help .	Manan pipas hayk'aqpas yanapayta necesitarqanchu.
Does anyone know which one it is?.	¿Pipas yachanchu mayqin kasqanmanta?.
After all, unlike real people.	Tukuy imamanta, mana chiqap runakuna hinachu.
I wasn’t unhappy.	Manam mana kusisqachu karqani.
I wouldn’t do anything like that.	Manam chaynataqa imatapas ruwaymanchu.
But he is a lonely man.	Ichaqa sapallan runa.
But it was great.	Ichaqa hatunmi karqan.
So thank you!.	Chaymi gracias!.
That 's what it 's like	Chayqa kanman .
One good, one bad.	Huk allin, huk mana allin.
There is no why, no how.	Manam kanchu imarayku, manam kanchu imayna.
No one had any reason to think so.	Manan pipas imaraykupas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
I had a great swim.	Hatun nadayta ruwarqani.
I am a school teacher.	Yachay wasipi yachachiqmi kani.
And now he couldn't stop thinking about it.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña chaypi yuyaymanayta saqiyta atirqachu.
So anything here makes no sense.	Chaymi kaypi imapas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
How did you know that.	¿Imaynatataq chayta yacharqanki.
He said he was fine.	Payqa allinmi kani nispa.
Maybe it’s better not.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman mana.
This one was the hardest.	Kay hukninmi aswan sasa karqa.
You probably were.	Yaqapaschá karqanki.
It sounds too crazy now.	Kunanqa llumpay loco hinam uyarikun.
It was against his will.	Mana munasqanman hinam karqa.
That 's the only thing	Chayqa chayllam .
He said he was doing it.	Payqa nirqam chaytam ruwachkani nispa.
Repetition is good.	Yapamanta rimayqa allinmi.
He sounds angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam uyarikun.
Today is not me day.	Kunan punchawqa manam ñuqa punchawchu.
It is not the	Manam chay .
I was at the end of the day.	Ñuqaqa p’unchaw tukukuypi karqani.
He almost seems happy to be there.	Yaqapaschá kusisqa hina kashan chaypi kasqanmanta.
It was always that simple.	Sapa kutim chayna facil karqa.
But I’m not quite happy with that.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa allintachu kusisqa kashani.
He wants to be a part of it.	Payqa chaymanta huknin kaytam munan.
Tell me about how we did it.	Imayna ruwasqaykumanta willaway.
Maybe it’s somewhere.	Ichapas maypipas kanman.
Everything was simple and easy back then.	Chay tiempopiqa tukuy imapas facilmi hinaspa facilmi karqa.
that is, the	chaymi.
No one could say for sure.	Manan pipas cheqaqtapuni niyta atirqanchu.
He couldn't tell that.	Chaytaqa manam yachayta atirqachu.
Anything is everything.	Imapas tukuy ima.
If something goes wrong, it will do the right thing.	Imapas mana allin kaptinqa allintam ruwanqa.
But, he’s good at it.	Ichaqa, payqa allinmi chaypi.
Maybe something went wrong.	Ichapas imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kashan.
Not a big deal at all.	Mana hatun ruwaychu ni imapipas.
Really scared this would happen.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa kay pasananta.
And these people.	Hinaspa kay runakunaqa.
I think the immediate next step is for me.	Yuyaykuni chaylla qatiqnin ruwayqa ñuqapaq.
This is the best restaurant in town.	Kaymi llaqtapi aswan allin mikhuy wasi.
Maybe he’s in the hospital.	Ichapas hospitalpi kachkan.
In fact, I actually did.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin ruwarqani.
But he will have to do it for now.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa ruwanan kanqa.
I'm not sure what the problem is though.	Manam segurochu kani ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta ichaqa.
There is nothing here for you.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu qampaq.
That’s where he wants to be.	Chayqa maypichus kayta munan chaypi.
I couldn’t believe it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
Like all the time.	Tukuy pacha hina.
But you always knew he was out there somewhere.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi yacharqanki maypipas hawapi kashasqanmanta.
That’s all for once.	Chaylla huk kutilla.
That had to be a little silly.	Chayqa huk chikan mana yuyayniyuqmi kanan karqa.
But if he were, he would have done so.	Ichaqa sichus pay kanman chayqa, hinan ruwanman karqan.
There is a way to do that, but not here.	Chaypaqqa kanmi huk ruway, ichaqa mana kaypichu.
It will be fine for now.	Kunankamaqa allinmi kanqa.
But then he can do better.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa aswan allintan ruwanman.
The task does not seem easy.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu rikch’akun.
Otherwise or whatever.	Mana chayqa icha ima.
Maybe he could, there.	Ichapas payqa atinman karqa, chaypi.
Young, beautiful, carefree.	Wayna, sumaq, mana llakisqa.
He always does the right thing.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi allin kaqta ruwan.
He really wanted to do this stupid thing.	Kay sonso imatapas ruwayqa chiqaptam munarqa.
Someone else there.	Huk runa chaypi.
The people outside really had no idea.	Hawapi kaq runakunaqa chiqaptam mana ima yuyayniyuq karqaku.
It will probably be the last.	Yaqapaschá qhepa kaq kanqa.
This makes a great meal.	Kayqa ancha allin mikhunata ruwan.
I could never stand it.'	Manam haykapipas aguantayta atirqanichu’.
In fact, this is not always the case.	Aswanpas manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
What we are you are.	Imataq kayku qampas kanki.
Very easy to do.	Ancha facil ruway.
Now they are here.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkanku.
He was me, at least.	Payqa ñuqam karqani, aswanpas.
And then it seemed more like home.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa aswan wasiman rikchakurqa.
Now it should be clear why.	Kunanqa sut’in kanan imarayku chayta.
You are the one who does the right thing.	Qanmi kanki allin kaqta ruwaq.
This is a historical fact.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
He wanted to believe it.	Chayta creeyta munarqa.
She said no one wanted to see her.	Payqa nirqam mana pipas qawayta munasqanmanta.
But that was three nights ago.	Ichaqa chayqa kinsa tuta ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
He noticed other things.	Huk imakunatapas repararqanmi.
I want to know why.	Yachayta munani imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
And you were alone in it.	Hinaspa chaypi sapallayki karqanki.
Yes, you certainly do.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin ruwanki.
Let me know if this is good.	Kay allin kaptinqa willaway.
He seemed pretty good.	Payqa allin allin hinam karqa.
Tell me why again.	Willaway imarayku chayna kasqanmanta yapamanta.
Even if it isn’t.	Mana chayna kaptinpas.
No one will ever do that.	Manam pipas haykapipas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
They’re obvious.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi kanku.
He was such a strange man.	Payqa chayna mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
Maybe you would and maybe you wouldn’t.	Ichapas chayta ruwawaq hinaspa ichapas mana.
He was terribly ill.	Manchay unqusqa kasqa.
Obviously it’s crazy.	Sut’inmi chayqa loco.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa nispa.
There were no other people.	Manam huk runakunaqa karqachu.
It failed spectacularly.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He died an hour later at a local hospital.	Huk hora qhepamanmi chay llaqtapi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
On the first night.	Ñawpaq kaq tutamanta.
He probably doesn't think it's worth it.	Payqa manachá imapaqpas valenchu ​​chaytaqa yuyaykunchu.
No chance now.	Mana chansa kunan.
No one was right.	Manam pipas allinchu karqa.
I really don't understand this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta entiendenichu.
I know what he means.	Yachanim ima niy munasqanmanta.
Can't understand why.	Mana entiendeyta atinchu imarayku kasqanmanta.
That just can’t work.	Chayqa manan llank’ayta atinchu.
But, great performance.	Ichaqa, hatun ruway.
That’s what they want to do, you know.	Chaytan paykunaqa ruwayta munanku, yachanki.
He came every year.	Sapa wata hamurqa.
He doesn’t want to fix it.	Manam allichayta munanchu.
Milly is a good time.	Millay allin pacha.
He figured out how to win.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imaynata atipananpaq.
Which sounds good.	Imataq allinta uyarikun.
Please let me know if you know anything.	Ama hina kaspa, imatapas yachasqaykita willaway.
If not, then .	Mana chayqa, chaymantaqa .
It was easy for him to do.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqqa facilmi karqa.
It doesn’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Something was wrong, he said.	Imapas mana allinchu kasqa, nispa.
That’s really hard.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sasa.
He seemed almost frightened.	Yaqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
What a wonderful mind.	Ima sumaq yuyayniyuq runa.
They weren’t always like that.	Paykunaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqanku.
Everything is so great.	Tukuy imapas ancha hatunmi.
So he left it.	Chaymi saqirqa.
He is very much involved.	Payqa anchatam chaypi kachkan.
It was in the summer.	Chayqa karqan verano killapin.
Maybe for me.	Ichapas ñuqapaq.
Please do that.	Ama hina kaspa chayta ruway.
He looked ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
The best thing is the second one.	Aswan allinqa iskay kaqmi.
But there is nothing for it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaypaqqa kanchu.
So tell me.	Chaymi willay.
This certainly does.	Kayqa cheqaqtapunin ruwan.
Can you just do it.	¿Atiwaqchu chaylla.
But there was nothing inhuman about it.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana runa hinachu chaypiqa karqan.
Some people disagree with me on this.	Wakin runakunaqa manan ñoqawanqa acuerdopichu kanku kaymanta.
He knew what was best for him.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus paypaq allin kasqanta.
He knew he could.	Payqa yacharqanmi atisqanmanta.
This thing is huge.	Kay imapas hatunmi.
Very nice job.	Ancha sumaq ruway.
You want him to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwananta munanki.
Everyone better be good.	Llapa runa aswan allin allin kay.
They are sad and scared.	Paykunaqa llakisqa, mancharisqa ima kanku.
A new chance.	Musuq chansa.
He pulled it off well the second time.	Payqa iskay kaq kutipi allintam hurqurqa.
The most difficult part.	Aswan sasa kaq.
Now here’s the interesting part.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkan chay sumaq kaq.
I couldn't say why.	Manam niyta atirqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
Yes, it is one of mine.	Arí, ñuqapa hukninmi.
A very big deal.	Ancha hatun ruway.
Can you tell me.	¿Atiwaqchu willayta.
Maybe he can see at night.	Ichapas tuta qawayta atinman.
Tomorrow will not be the same as today.	Paqarin punchawqa manam kunan punchaw hinachu kanqa.
It won’t stay that way much longer.	Manan aswan unaytachu chhayna kanqa.
You were right, he is a nice guy.	Allintam nirqanki, payqa sumaq runam.
That was how he felt now.	Chaynatam kunanqa tarikurqa.
So far, it doesn’t exist.	Kunankamaqa manam kanchu.
I'm sure it means nothing at all.	Seguro kani mana imatapas niyta munanchu ni imapipas.
I think he was really sick.	Chiqap unqusqa kasqanmantam piensani.
It seems obvious.	Sut’inmi rikch’akun.
It’s terribly amazing.	Manchay admirakuypaqmi.
I didn’t want to hear those things.	Chaykunataqa manam uyariyta munarqanichu.
No, three times now.	Manan, kunan kinsa kutita.
But it was good for him.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan paypaq.
He is not comfortable with it.	Payqa manan chaywanqa allintachu tarikun.
That sounds really, really, really nice.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi uyarikun.
We are no longer together.	Manañam kuskachu kanchik.
That was almost a decade ago now.	Chayqa yaqa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi kunanqa karqa.
Describe the characteristics.	Chayna kasqanmanta willay.
Did he just say that.	¿Chayllachu nirqa.
So the man is a man after all.	Chaymi chay runaqa runa tukuy imamanta.
That one is the best.	Chay hukninmi aswan allinqa.
He was the first to do so.	Paymi ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruwarqan.
You cannot ignore them.	Chaykunataqa manam mana uyariyta atiwaqchu.
I hear it right.	Allintam uyarini.
John was a happy man.	Juanqa kusisqa runam karqa.
She knew the baby was there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay wawa chaypi kashasqanmanta.
He looked a little crazy.	Payqa huk chikan loco hinam rikchakurqa.
Okay, well that could be true.	Allinmi, allinmi chayqa chiqap kanman.
That was kind of sad, really.	Chayqa huk laya llakikuypaqmi karqa, chiqaptapuni.
That was two days ago.	Chayqa iskay punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He was nobody, he said.	Payqa manam pipas karqachu, nispa.
Now it will be.	Kunanqa kanqa.
But you don’t know how to respond.	Ichaqa manan yachankichu imayna kutichiyta.
I kind of wish she did though.	Ñuqaqa huk laya munayman payqa ichaqa.
Maybe, he finally said.	Ichapas, nispas tukukuypi nisqa.
It didn’t go well at all, at all.	Manam allintachu rirqa ni imapipas, ni imapipas.
I have no idea who he is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani pi kasqanmanta.
He can’t get over it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa atipayta atinchu.
Maybe they were real.	Ichapas paykunaqa chiqap karqaku.
And this one a year ago.	Hinaspa kay huknin wata ñawpaqta.
So the sinner could wait.	Chaymi huchayoq runaqa suyayta atinman karqan.
It might be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanman.
He was a big drunk.	Payqa hatun machasqa kasqa.
Everyone talks about this.	Tukuy runa kaymanta riman.
Everyone wants it to happen.	Lliwmi munanku chayna kananta.
All in all, it wouldn't have been easy.	Tukuy ima, mana facilchu kanman karqa.
He allowed it to happen.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi saqirqa.
I think maybe he is.	Yuyaykuni ichapas payqa kanman.
It was a cold winter night.	Chayqa chiri chiri tutam karqa.
And it could very well be.	Hinaspa ancha allintam kanman.
And they were like him.	Hinan paykunaqa pay hina karqanku.
Surprisingly, he did.	Admirakuypaqmi, chaytaqa ruwarqa.
I thought that might be the case.	Chayna kanman nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
If this is the case, it’s wonderful.	Sichus kay kanman chayqa, sumaqmi.
That was obviously ridiculous.	Chayqa sut’inmi asikunapaq hina karqan.
This was probably the clever evil.	Kayqa ichapas chay allin yuyayniyuq millay karqa.
He wanted to study his methods carefully.	Payqa allintan estudiayta munarqan imayna ruwasqanmanta.
Not with anyone.	Mana piwanpas.
It would be faster and safer.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan seguro kanman.
For what he has done.	Imakunatapas ruwasqanmanta.
However, it is very, very difficult to do.	Ichaqa, ancha, ancha sasa ruwaymi.
He didn’t want to be an adult.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kuraq runa kayta.
Hopefully, you will soon.	Munaymanmi, pisi tiempollamantan chayta ruwanki.
I am really disappointed.	Chiqaptam hukmanyasqa kachkani.
He would never do such a horrible thing.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina millay ruwaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
I can’t imagine why.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinichu imarayku.
I can’t do with that.	Chaywanqa manam atiymanchu.
It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
How’s this going to be.	Imaynataq kay.
Rather like people.	Aswanpas runakuna hina.
You know, hungry.	Yachanki, yarqaymanta.
Go through that again.	Chayta yapamanta riy.
It's almost like that.	Yaqa chayna kasqanmantam rimachkan.
They want to be like him.	Pay hina kaytam munanku.
He did a wonderful job.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi ruwarqa.
He really was that funny.	Payqa chiqaptam chayna asikunapaq karqa.
Then three years, nothing.	Chaymanta kimsa wata, mana imapas.
You are the secret.	Qanmi kanki pakasqa kaq.
I want to hear all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta uyariyta munani.
This thing is a first.	Kay imapas ñawpaq kaqmi.
Know that it will happen.	Yachay chay pasananta.
He’s great, you know.	Payqa hatunmi, yachanki.
But what a player he is.	Ichaqa ima pukllaqmi.
He knew it well enough.	Payqa allintan yacharqan.
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Unayñan chayta ruwayta munarqani.
The truth is too much.	Cheqaq kaqmi nishuta.
But it wasn’t right for him to say that.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan chayta nisqanqa.
But that’s not all, folks.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu, runakuna.
Be with it.	Chaywan kay.
I feel like a new person.	Musuq runa hinam tarikuni.
He probably will.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanqa.
Happy birthday, baby.	Kusisqa p'unchaw, wawa.
He wants to be human.	Payqa runa kaytam munan.
You want him to know you’re there.	Chaypi kasqaykita yachananta munanki.
I'm glad he's there.	Kusisqam kachkani chaypi kasqanmanta.
This is, please.	Kayqa, ama hina kaspa.
It could be one, anyway.	Hukninmi kanman, imayna kaptinpas.
Now, he was a man of one mind.	Kunanqa, huk yuyayniyuq runam karqa.
Nothing but black.	Mana imapas aswanpas yana.
About one per week and a half.	Yaqa huk sapa semana kuskan.
So that would have been a big deal.	Chaymi chayqa huk hatun ruway kanman karqan.
No, really, anyway.	Mana, chiqap, imayna kaptinpas.
That’s probably not a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu.
It didn’t happen right away, but it happened.	Manam chayllachu pasarqa, ichaqa pasarqa.
There was the cause of the problem.	Chaypin kasharqan imarayku chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Everyone is a good person.	Tukuy allin runa.
He seemed really disappointed.	Payqa chiqaptam hukmanyasqa hina karqa.
I'm fine with that for now.	Chaywanqa kunankamaqa allinmi kachkani.
He couldn't believe he was doing it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu chayta ruwasqanta.
It’s not like a big deal.	Manan hatun ruway hinachu.
The worst was, in the morning.	Aswan mana allinqa karqa, tutamanta.
It seemed a little absurd.	Huk chikan mana yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
Someone really has to do it.	Pipas chiqaptam ruwanan.
They were obviously scared.	Sut’inmi karqan mancharisqa kasqankuta.
I don’t know how anyone can be so mean.	Mana yachanichu imaynatataq pipas chhayna millay kanman chayta.
Do the hard things.	Sinchi ruwaykunata ruway.
I can talk about it.	Rimayta atiyman.
Actually, it was great.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allinmi karqa.
Here he was mostly successful.	Kaypiqa yaqa llapanpim allinta ruwarqa.
I didn’t feel like I was ready.	Manam listochu hina tarikurqani.
It was so easy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha facilmi karqa.
This goes beyond that.	Kayqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi.
Yes, the truth.	Arí, chiqap kaq.
He did it again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta ruwarqa.
That alone is nothing.	Chayqa sapallanmi mana imapas.
I didn’t mean to say he wasn’t good enough.	Manam paytaqa mana allinchu niyta munarqanichu.
But what is to be done about it?.	Ichaqa, ¿imatam chaymanta ruwana?.
Everything really went very well.	Chiqaptam tukuy imapas ancha allinta rirqa.
This would be about right.	Kayqa yaqa allinmi kanman.
But he never wanted to know about it.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymanta yachayta munarqanchu.
He wasn't sure what to expect.	Manam segurochu karqa ima suyasqanmanta.
He knows what it’s like.	Payqa yachanmi imayna kasqanmanta.
Very nice, indeed.	Ancha sumaq, chiqap.
It wasn’t good to be out there.	Chay hawapi kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
It's really hard not to.	Chiqaptam sasa mana chayna kaptinqa.
But you got lucky there.	Ichaqa chaypi suerteyoqmi karqanki.
An hour passed and then two.	Huk hora pasarqa chaymanta iskay.
He thinks a lot about you.	Payqa anchatan qanmanta yuyaykun.
However, it was good.	Ichaqa, allinmi karqa.
He asked me why.	Paymi tapuwarqa imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He is easy to talk to.	Paywan rimayqa facilmi.
No, it was a man.	Manan, huk runan karqan.
He knows very well.	Payqa ancha allintam yachan.
It’s OK to disagree.	Mana acuerdopi kayqa allinmi.
There’s no real precedent for it.	Manam chiqap ñawpaq kaq kanchu chaypaqqa.
He couldn't see her anywhere.	Manas maypipas rikuyta atirqachu.
Everything I didn’t know.	Tukuy imapas mana yacharqanichu.
That’s my thing.	Chayqa ñuqapa imapas.
Yes, we are clear.	Arí, sut'inmi kayku.
I thought you wanted to have sex with me.	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim ñuqawan puñuyta munasqaykita.
I really want to talk to it.	Anchatan munani chaywan rimayta.
It should be pretty obvious why.	Allin sut’inmi kanan imarayku.
They were too intelligent for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
For a while he said nothing.	Huk tiempon mana imatapas nirqanchu.
There was uncertainty.	Mana seguro kaymi karqa.
You know where things are.	Yachankim maypi imapas kasqanmanta.
He repeats this a few times.	Kayta iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta ruwan.
It’s just not worth it.	Chaylla mana valenchu.
I won’t be good enough for you.	Manam qampaq allinchu kasaq.
But this wouldn’t be a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman kayqa.
This cannot be allowed.	Kaytaqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
Like the one above.	Hawapi kaq hina.
Wherever it is.	Maypi kaptinpas.
Excuse me what? 	Pampachaykuway imata?
He doesn't do this now.	Kunanqa manam kayta ruwanchu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allintachu.
But this is not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu kayqa.
It’s better difficult.	Aswan allinmi sasa.
That’s his great success.	Chaymi hatun allin ruwasqanqa.
That was no big deal.	Chayqa manan hatun ruwaychu karqan.
Good morning, he says.	Allin p’unchaw, nispas nin.
That was kind of hard.	Chayqa huk laya sasam karqa.
It’s a different idea.	Huk yuyayniyuqmi.
Performance would be better.	Ruwayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
If it doesn’t, it’s foolish.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa, mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I soon saw that this would not happen.	Pisi tiempollamantan rikurqani chay mana pasananta.
Why, of course.	Imarayku, chiqamanta.
So it’s not that easy.	Chaymi mana chayna facilchu.
It was hidden there all along.	Chaypin tukuy tiempo pakasqa.
Someone predicted that some time ago.	Pipas chayta willarqan huk tiempo ñawpaqta.
I think, actually, he was.	Yuyaykuni, cheqaqtapuni, payqa karqan.
He stayed there for about two weeks.	Payqa yaqa iskay semanan chaypi qhepakurqan.
There was no time for that, anyway.	Chaypaqqa manam tiempo karqachu, imayna kaptinpas.
This man was a fool.	Kay runaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Very good practice.	Ancha allin ruway.
That lasted about a year.	Chayqa yaqa huk wata hinam karqa.
But they’re not getting any worse.	Ichaqa manan aswan mana allinchu kashanku.
It’s not a process.	Manam huk ruwaychu.
This was certainly the case here.	Kaypiqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
Surprisingly, it was insane.	Admirakuypaqmi, loco hinam karqa.
I couldn’t eat much this morning.	Kunan paqarin mana anchata mikhuyta atirqanichu.
They were always there for me.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq karqaku.
I was here one evening.	Huk chisi kaypi karqani.
No one seems to be home.	Mana pipas wasinman rikchakun.
Now he knew better.	Kunanqa allintan yacharqan.
The patient is no longer.	Unqusqa manaña.
Maybe he should be.	Ichapas payqa kanan.
But something else.	Ichaqa imapas huk kaq.
He seemed really bothered by it.	Chiqaptam chaywan llakisqa hina karqa.
But it must be quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kanan.
That was about a few weeks ago.	Chayqa karqan yaqa iskay kinsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
They are great people.	Paykunaqa hatun runakunam kanku.
He was like a mad man.	Payqa loco runa hinam karqa.
And they really, really mean that this time.	Hinaspa chayta chiqap, chiqaptapuni kay kutipi niyta munanku.
I thought I’d say.	Niyta yuyaykurqani.
That’s how I know about it.	Chaynatam chaymantaqa yachani.
It’s wrong about everything.	Tukuy imamanta pantasqa.
He will do it.	Paymi chaytaqa ruwanqa.
He knew the man was there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay runa chaypi kashasqanmanta.
He was a man of good character.	Payqa allin ruwaq runan karqan.
It wasn’t too bad.	Mana ancha mana allinchu karqan.
The worst part is being alone.	Aswan mana allinqa sapallay kaymi.
Something to help him.	Imapas payta yanapananpaq.
No idea what happened.	Mana yuyayniyuq imachus pasasqanmanta.
There’s no real problem with that.	Manam chiqap sasachakuy kanchu chaypiqa.
That’s what you were like.	Chay hinam karqanki.
But then maybe they were.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa ichapas chayna karqaku.
He is very excited about this.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kaymanta kachkan.
I think people are scared.	Runakuna mancharisqa kasqankuta yuyani.
Anything could be, could be.	Imapas kanman, kanman.
He genuinely wants to help.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yanapayta munan.
I was there for a while.	Huk rato chaypi karqani.
But he is not like her.	Ichaqa manan pay hinachu.
I am busy all day.	Tukuy punchawmi ocupasqa kachkani.
Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin pay karqan.
I’m not very happy.	Manam ancha kusisqachu kani.
We really can’t buy anyone.	Chiqaptaqa manam pitapas rantiyta atichwanchu.
He said it was twenty.	Payqa iskay chunka kasqanmantam nirqa.
No more, and he would have seemed scared.	Manaña, hinaspa mancharisqa hina kanman karqan.
You’re something.	Imapas kanki.
There are some great people.	Wakin hatun runakunam kan.
He probably wasn't sure how he was going to do it.	Payqa manapaschá segurochu karqan imayna ruwananta.
She planned to become a schoolteacher.	Payqa escuelapi yachachiq kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
He wants a lot of things.	Payqa achkatam munan.
This statement again.	Kay rimayta yapamanta.
He, hurt and sad.	Pay, k’irisqa hinaspa llakisqa.
But he seemed fine with it.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakurqa chaywanqa.
I want to understand this better.	Kaytaqa aswan allinta entiendeyta munani.
No idea about it.	Mana yuyayniyuq chaymanta.
Otherwise maybe better not.	Mana chayqa ichapas aswan allin mana.
First, if indeed he existed in the past.	Ñawpaqta, sichus cheqaqtapuni payqa ñawpaq tiempopi karqan chayqa.
I just can't figure it out.	Ichapas manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atinichu.
Unfortunately this thing is no longer available.	Llakikuypaqmi kay imapas manaña kanchu.
He seems to have an idea.	Payqa huk yuyayniyuq hinam kachkan.
It was wonderful to be tired.	Sayk’usqa kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqan.
Very unreasonable of me.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi ñuqamanta.
We cannot do that without not doing it.	Chaytaqa mana mana ruwaspaqa manam ruwayta atichwanchu.
There had to be something.	Imapas kanan karqan.
This feature was posted about a month ago.	Kay ruwayqa yaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi churasqa karqan.
The best thing I’ve ever done.	Aswan allin ruwasqaymanta.
He was tired, as always.	Sayk’usqañan kasqa, sapa kuti hina.
I didn’t know how to respond.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kutichiyta.
He couldn't think about it.	Payqa manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
That happened every day.	Chayqa sapa punchawmi pasarqa.
He wanted to know where she was.	Payqa maypi kasqanmantam yachayta munarqa.
That’s pretty young.	Chayqa ancha wayna.
Now he knew what he had to do.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
This is very .	Kayqa ancha .
He cannot fail to do good works.	Manan allin ruwaykunata mana ruwayta atinmanchu.
He’s very tired.	Sinchita sayk’usqa.
Let's hope he does a great job.	Suyasun hatun llamkayta ruwananta.
After all, something is better than nothing.	Tukuy imamanta, imapas aswan allinqa mana imamantapas.
But still, still.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas, chayna kaptinpas.
They are the majority.	Paykunaqa aswan achka runakunam kanku.
But where else.	Ichaqa maypi hukmanta.
It was sad if true.	Chiqap kaptinqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I know it will happen one day.	Yachanim huk punchaw chayna pasananta.
He thinks it is.	Payqa piensanmi chayna kananpaq.
They’re there.	Chaypin kashanku.
But the friendship was probably as good, if not better.	Ichaqa amigontin kayqa yaqapaschá allin karqan, mana chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
It is not good for you in that city.	Chay llaqtapiqa manam allinchu qampaq.
He would continue to be.	Payqa hinallam kanman.
It does nothing but do it right.	Manan imapas ruwanchu aswanpas allinta ruwaymi.
About a month, actually.	Yaqa huk killa, chiqaptaqa.
He was still being himself.	Payqa hinallam pay kikin kachkarqa.
I don’t really know exactly what happened.	Manam chiqaptachu allinta yachani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
This one takes some thought.	Kay hukninmi wakin yuyaymanayta munan.
He loves to be famous.	Payqa anchatam munan riqsisqa kayta.
However, this thing is pretty cool.	Ichaqa, kay imapas ancha sumaqmi.
John has no idea why.	Juanqa manan yuyaykunchu imarayku chayta.
He was with us the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon ñoqaykuwan karqan.
Then who.	Chaymantaqa pikuna.
Never, really.	Mana hayk’aqpas, chiqaptapuni.
It looks sad now.	Kunanqa llakikuypaqmi rikchakun.
He wanted her to stop.	Payqa munarqanmi manaña chayta ruwananta.
Everything seemed confusing.	Tukuy imapas pantasqa hinam karqa.
Don't forget these things.	Chaykunataqa ama qunqaychu.
She’s beautiful, this is her.	Payqa sumaqmi, kaymi.
So many times.	Chaymi achka kutipi.
It’s a double-edged sword.	Iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
They always seem hungry.	Sapa kuti yarqasqa hinam kanku.
Now that’s a good thing to do.	Kunanqa chay ruwayqa allinmi.
He said he was very disappointed.	Paymi nirqa ancha hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta.
Please tell me something else.	Ama hina kaspa, hukta willaway.
And less successful.	Hinaspa aswan pisi allin ruwaq.
I had always wanted to know what that would look like.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yachayta munarqani imaynataq chay kanman chayta.
And how to do things right.	Hinaspa imaynatataq imatapas allinta ruwanan.
This is very unlike him.	Kayqa ancha mana pay hinachu.
Three at most.	Kimsa aswan achka.
He says there is something new about it.	Paymi nin chaypi imapas mosoq kasqanta.
And he stayed there.	Hinan payqa chaypi qhepakurqan.
Everyone always wants more.	Lliwmi sapa kutilla aswan achkata munanku.
That’s probably not what you really mean.	Manachá chaytachu cheqaqtapuni niyta munanki.
I don’t understand the way.	Manam entiendenichu ñanta.
You don’t know how to fix him.	Mana yachankichu imaynatachus payta allichayta.
It was such an easy thing to do.	Chayna facil ruwaymi karqa.
All those wonderful people.	Tukuy chay sumaq runakuna.
There is the thing.	Chaypim kachkan chay imapas.
I’ll be happy anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas kusisqam kasaq.
He couldn't sit here.	Payqa manam kaypi tiyayta atirqachu.
I didn’t want to eat or sleep.	Manam mikuyta nitaq puñuyta munarqanichu.
I am a happily married man.	Kusisqa casarasqa runam kani.
Of course, that might not be so good.	Arí, chayqa manapaschá chhayna allinchu kanman.
I almost feel good again.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta allinta sientekuni.
This can be very strange.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi kanman.
At night, you know.	Tutan, yachanki.
He couldn't pretend to be nervous here.	Payqa manan kaypiqa mancharisqa hina kayta atirqanchu.
Everything happened quickly.	Tukuy imapas utqayllam pasarqa.
Everyone is very, very nervous.	Lliwmi ancha, ancha mancharisqa kachkanku.
He’s already there.	Payqa ñam kachkan.
The bigger the problem, the better.	Aswan hatun sasachakuy kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
This is not so unlikely.	Kayqa manan chhayna mana hinachu.
I'm pretty sure.	Yaqapaschá seguro kani.
Do you know how?.	¿Yachankichu imaynata?.
And he went inside.	Hinan payqa haykurqan.
For low speed.	Pisi utqaylla ruwanapaq.
It’s quick, it’s great.	Usqhaylla, ancha allinmi.
That is, a lot of people.	Chayqa, achka runakunam.
I'm doing something.	Imatapas ruwachkani.
It would have been crazy not to.	Mana ruwayqa loco kanman karqan.
He says, of course, he does.	Payqa ninmi, sut’inmi, chaytan ruwan.
They’re out there.	Paykunaqa hawapi kachkanku.
He couldn’t, of course.	Mana atirqachu, sut’inmi.
He knew how to take it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna hap’iyta.
Really ugly.	Chiqap millay.
He is very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
But he is sad and worried.	Ichaqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kashan.
I need you to do some things.	Wakin ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaqmi necesitasaq.
And therein lies this problem.	Hinaspa chaypim kachkan kay sasachakuy.
This thing is bigger than, well, anything else.	Kay imapas aswan hatunmi, allinmi, imamantapas.
That’s the first injury.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaq k’irisqa kaymi.
A little disappointed, but not angry.	Huk chikan hukmanyasqa, ichaqa mana phiñasqa.
He was very angry.	Ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
And the biggest guy.	Hinaspa aswan hatun wayna.
He couldn't ignore that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanchu.
Can't say what it is.	Mana ima kasqanmanta niyta atinchu.
But still, that seemed easy.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas, chayqa facilmi rikchakurqa.
They were all this year.	Paykunaqa llapallankum kay wata karqaku.
But it certainly can be.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kanman.
Alright!' 	Allinmi!'
Probably anything really.	Yaqapaschá imapas chiqaptaqa.
Not before, not now, never.	Mana ñawpaq, mana kunan, mana hayk’aqpas.
Probably being tired.	Yaqapaschá sayk’usqa kay.
So that’s a little different.	Chaymi chayqa huk chikan chikan.
But perhaps it was the best.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá aswan allinqa karqan.
All of these things.	Tukuy kaykunaqa.
And he had to do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanan karqan.
He looks foolish.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam rikchakun.
She didn’t want him.	Payqa manan paytaqa munarqanchu.
If you know about it.	Chaymanta yachanki chayqa.
Don’t be so worried.	Ama chayna llakisqa kaychu.
He is the one you think he is.	Paymi chayna kasqanmanta yuyanki.
I don’t want to do this tonight.	Manam kunan tutaqa kayta ruwayta munanichu.
Now again, again.	Kunanqa yapamanta.
But she is very nice.	Ichaqa payqa ancha sumaqmi.
You have to do it accordingly.	Chayman hinam ruwanayki.
He didn’t want to stay anywhere.	Payqa manan maypipas qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
In the future, yes.	Hamuq tiempopiqa, arí.
But then, he was angry.	Ichaqa chaymanta, phiñasqa kasharqan.
Seriously, not happy.	Serio, mana kusisqachu.
I don’t understand it now.	Manam kunanqa entiendenichu.
So he was fired.	Chaymi payqa qarqosqa karqan.
So he went there.	Chaymi chaypi rirqa.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
He’s already done it.	Payqa ñam chayta ruwarqa.
Now this makes no sense.	Kunanqa kayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
You better not do that.	Aswan allinmi mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
Both are depressed.	Iskayninkum llakisqa kachkanku.
He does it alone anyway.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwan imayna kaptinpas.
But yes, he did.	Ichaqa arí, chaytan ruwarqan.
Maybe a few months, maybe a year.	Ichapas iskay kimsa killa, ichapas huk wata.
And now a baby.	Hinaspa kunan huk wawa.
I thought it might be up to me.	Yuyarqanim ñuqamanta kanman nispa.
That’s a bad guy.	Chayqa mana allin runa.
You actually have an idea about it.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam huk yuyayniyuq kanki.
It’s the only thing.	Chaylla kaqmi.
A foolish act.	Huk mana yuyayniyuq ruway.
He looked unsure.	Payqa mana seguro hinam rikchakurqa.
I still don't know why.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
They sure seemed innocent.	Paykunaqa seguro hinan mana huchayoq hina karqanku.
This failure requires a response.	Kay mana ruwayqa kutichiyta munan.
He is always with you.	Payqa tukuy tiempon qanwan kashan.
That’s a good thing, man.	Chayqa allinmi, runa.
Not good, but it could have been worse.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
They are intelligent people.	Yachaysapa runakunam.
It’s sure to get bigger and bigger every year.	Seguro sapa wata aswan hatun aswan hatun kanqa.
I always fail.	Sapa kutim mana allinta ruwani.
He is still a mystery.	Payqa kunankamapas mana riqsisqa runam kachkan.
This guy is crazy.	Kay runaqa loco.
A couple of months.	Iskay kimsa killa.
He got a lot out of it.	Payqa achkatam chaymanta hurqurqa.
It was too soon for that.	Chaypaqqa ancha utqayllam karqa.
I wasn’t ready to go home.	Manam wasiyman rinaypaq hinachu karqani.
A nonsense, perhaps.	Huk mana yuyayniyuq, ichapas.
Here he succeeds rather well.	Kaypiqa aswan allintam allinta ruwan.
So he was a human being.	Chaymi payqa runa kasqa.
Hopefully, so here it is.	Munaymanmi, chaymi kaypi kachkan.
I wasn’t here.	Manam kaypichu karqani.
I don't want to repeat myself here.	Kaypiqa manam yapamanta rimayta munanichu.
I really don’t want to finish.	Chiqaptaqa manam tukuyta munanichu.
He wanted to know what it was like.	Payqa yachayta munarqa imayna chay kasqanta.
All day, all day long.	Tukuy punchaw, tukuy punchaw.
Please be quick.	Ama hina kaspa, usqhaylla kay.
Good for a few laughs.	Allinmi iskay kimsa asikunapaq.
So it was a good day.	Chaymi allin punchaw karqa.
I couldn’t really do anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
And, in many cases, you don't know.	Hinaspa, achka kutipi, mana yachankichu.
I always did, then.	Sapa kutim ruwarqani, chaymanta.
It’s been about three days.	Yaqa kimsa punchawmi.
I want to fix it.	Munani allichayta.
He probably won’t be here.	Payqa manachá kaypichu kanqa.
All black and larger.	Tukuy yana chaymanta aswan hatun.
He never did anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas ruwarqanchu.
The best part was that it wasn't too hard yet.	Aswan allin kaqmi karqa, manaraqmi sinchi sasachu karqa.
I can’t stay with you.	Manan qanwan qhepakuyta atiymanchu.
He was happy with that.	Chaywanqa kusisqam tarikurqa.
He knew better, now.	Payqa aswan allintam yacharqa, kunanqa.
I don’t think you can fix it here.	Manam kaypiqa allichayta atisqaykita yuyanichu.
Yes, but .	Arí, ichaqa .
They were all sick.	Llapallankum unqusqa karqaku.
We all did it.	Llapallankum ruwarqayku.
There is a precedent.	Huk ñawpaqmantaraqmi kan.
Humanity is hurt.	Runa kayqa k’irisqa kachkan.
Now it’s your turn.	Kunanqa qampaq.
That’s what he said.	Chayta nisqanmanta.
Unfortunately, we can't.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam atichwanchu.
That is more likely to be true than not.	Chayqa yaqapaschá cheqaq kanman mana cheqaqchu kasqanmantaqa.
That would be fine no matter what.	Chayqa allinmi kanman manaña imapas kaptinpas.
I hope to do the same one day.	Ñuqapas huk punchaw chayta ruwayta suyachkani.
But there was someone.	Ichaqa pipas karqan.
That’s it, that’s it.	Chayqa, chayllam.
So now there were a lot of people there.	Chaymi kunanqa achka runakuna chaypi karqaku.
He probably can't say that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa niyta atinmanchu.
I mean, you .	Niyta munani, qam .
He had looked at her before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi qhawarisqa.
He was lucky not to be fired.	Payqa suerteyoqmi karqan mana qarqosqa kananpaq.
This is a bad thing, not a good thing.	Kayqa mana allin ruwaymi, manam allin ruwaychu.
It will be helpful to do this in two ways.	Iskay ruwaypi chayta ruwayqa allinmi kanqa.
It could be a problem.	Huk sasachakuy kanman.
However, it will be good.	Ichaqa, allinmi kanqa.
Looks like it's safe.	Seguro hinam rikchakun.
Maybe better at that than here.	Ichapas chaypi aswan allin kaymantaqa.
It was a beautiful discomfort.	Chayqa sumaq mana allin kaymi karqa.
That doesn’t sound too difficult.	Chayqa manan ancha sasachu uyarikun.
He hadn’t been like that in a long time.	Payqa unayñan mana chay hinachu kasqa.
They are really great.	Paykunaqa chiqap hatunmi kanku.
He didn’t need anyone.	Payqa manan pitapas necesitarqanchu.
I really can't stand it anymore.	Chiqaptaqa manañam aguantayta atinichu.
I hear it again.	Hukmanta uyarini.
He is no longer there.	Payqa manañan kanchu.
It just sort of happened.	Chayllaraqmi huk laya pasarqa.
These were at least people.	Kaykunaqa aswanpas runakunam karqaku.
Can you handle it?' 	¿Atiwaqchu atipayta?’, nispa.
This is not unique.	Kayqa manam sapallanchu.
I couldn’t be sure of anything.	Manam imamantapas seguro kayta atirqanichu.
Why, that’s absurd.	Imarayku, chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
But no, it’s not.	Ichaqa manan, manan.
I didn't know how to answer that.	Chaytaqa manam imayna kutichiyta yacharqanichu.
They are not as good as they were a year ago.	Paykunaqa manan huk wata ñawpaqta hinachu allin kanku.
That’s a good thing folks.	Chayqa allinmi runakuna.
Happy people.	Kusisqa runakuna.
There’s that in it.	Chaypin chay kashan.
If so, that’s it.	Chayna kaptinqa chayllam.
He was a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqaptam sumaq runa karqa.
He then wants to tell it.	Payqa chaymanta chayta willayta munan.
I didn’t see anything.	Mana imatapas rikurqanichu.
But he knows something is wrong.	Ichaqa yachanmi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
The man was pathetic.	Chay runaqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Do all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruway.
You can do a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwawaq.
I am a sad person.	Llakisqa runam kani.
What had to happen, had to happen.	Imachus kanan karqan, kanan karqan.
All those people there.	Llapan chay runakuna chaypi.
It sounds at night.	Tuta uyarikun.
He was a heavy smoker.	Payqa sinchitan cigarrota pitaq.
I don't see how it can be any longer.	Manam rikunichu imaynatam aswan unayta kanman chayta.
This looks really, really good.	Kayqa chiqap, chiqap allin rikchakun.
I was the first to do that.	Ñuqam chaytaqa puntata ruwarqani.
He barely looked at her.	Payqa yaqapaschá qhawarisqa.
He knew that was not true.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay mana cheqaq kasqanmanta.
I agree with that too.	Ñuqapas chaytam acuerdopi kani.
He looks kind of like.	Payqa rikchakun huk laya.
No one's ever done that.	Manan pipas hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Nobody wants to play with me.	Manam pipas ñuqawan pukllayta munanchu.
And he does it well.	Hinaspa allinta ruwan.
I am very excited about this.	Kaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
So he thought of this a while ago.	Chaymi huk rato ñawpaqta kayta yuyaykurqan.
In fact, they’re rather unattractive.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa aswan mana sumaqmi kanku.
He tried to help her, but he couldn’t.	Payqa yanapayta munarqanmi, ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
That's good .	Chayqa allinmi .
But I knew it was right.	Ichaqa allintan yacharqani.
That was a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi karqa ichaqa.
No one is sure what the truth is.	Manan pipas segurochu kashan imachus cheqaq kasqanmantaqa.
It was almost always.	Yaqa sapa kutim karqan.
It’s still not good enough.	Kunankamapas manam allinchu.
In that beautiful house.	Chay sumaq wasipi.
That didn't work out too well.	Chayqa manam ancha allintachu lluqsirqa.
A couple of nights ago.	Huk iskay tuta ñawpaqta.
Both were foolish.	Iskayninkum mana yuyayniyuq karqaku.
It was a very nervous night.	Ancha mancharisqa tutan karqan.
Well, if that’s what they really want.	Allinmi, sichus chayta cheqaqtapuni munanku chayqa.
He did this several times.	Chaytan askha kutita ruwarqan.
Who let him do that.	Pitaq chayta ruwananpaq saqirqa.
Many times many.	Achka kuti achka.
People all like him.	Runakunaqa llapallankum paytaqa gustan.
I want it yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi munani.
Here they were both.	Kaypim iskayninku karqaku.
But he didn't know what was going to happen now.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu kunan imachus kananta.
They were not very happy.	Paykunaqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqaku.
And then you can be sure.	Hinaspa chaymanta seguro kanki.
But it is now available.	Ichaqa kunanmi kashan.
I couldn’t sing.	Manam takiyta atirqanichu.
That’s not untrue this summer.	Chayqa manan mana cheqaqchu kay chiri killapi.
I didn’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu.
I want to ask him.	Payta tapuyta munani.
There was something here.	Kaypiqa imapas karqa.
That wouldn’t be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
I was just sure.	Chayllaraqmi seguro karqani.
Happy weekend!.	¡Kusisqa semana tukuyta!.
Just like last time.	Qayna kutipi hina.
But it just happened.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
I can’t leave again.	Manam hukmanta ripuyta atiymanchu.
But that wouldn’t work.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa allinchu kanman.
It’s been like that for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina kashan.
He would have to do it.	Payqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
Something that happened to you.	Imapas qanwan pasasqanmanta.
They’re crazy about him.	Paymanta loco kanku.
It’s been a really tough week.	Chiqamanta sasa semana karqa.
That’s like maybe.	Chayqa ichapas hina.
I didn’t want to be alone.	Manam sapallay kayta munarqanichu.
Maybe you want to think about something else, if that's the case.	Ichapas huk ruwaypi yuyaymanayta munanki, chayna kaptinqa.
It’s not hard to buy something no more.	Manam sasachu imapas rantiyta atinchu manaña aswan.
But you may not really want that.	Ichaqa manapaschá chaytaqa anchatachu munanki.
He couldn’t get hold of things.	Payqa manan imakunatapas hap’iyta atirqanchu.
I wanted to be alone.	Ñoqaqa sapallay kaytam munarqani.
You are considered extremely unlikely.	Sinchi mana allinpaq qhawarisqa kanki.
Someone else will have to do it.	Huk runam ruwanan kanqa.
I know this may not be easy.	Yachanim kayqa manapaschá facilchu kanman.
And so you've ever been.	Hinaspa chay hinaqa hayk'aqpas karqanki.
You never want to do anything again.	Manañam haykapipas imatapas ruwayta munankichu.
But he wants to get out.	Ichaqa lluqsiyta munan.
If he didn't, he continued.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa hinallam nirqa.
So there is a big problem here.	Chaymi kaypi hatun sasachakuy kachkan.
Can't think of anything else.	Mana hukta yuyaymanayta atinchu.
But he's a reasonable person, actually.	Ichaqa payqa allin yuyayniyuq runam, chiqaptaqa.
Of course, that wasn’t always the case.	Chiqamanta, chay ruwayqa manas sapa kutichu karqa.
He was uncomfortably upset.	Payqa mana allintachu llakisqa kasharqan.
Things will be easier.	Imapas aswan facilmi kanqa.
It was anything but a solo act.	Chayqa imapas karqan, aswanpas sapallan ruwaymi karqan.
But it was easier.	Ichaqa aswan facilmi karqan.
He told her to do what he said.	Nisqanman hina ruwananpaqmi nirqa.
Soon it would be better.	Pisi tiempollamantan aswan allin kanman.
Eat more and more.	Astawan mikhuy.
Yesterday, tomorrow, tonight.	Qayna, paqarin, kay tuta.
To almost get caught.	Yaqa hap’isqa kananpaq.
Being a child is not easy.	Wawa kayqa manan facilchu.
I'm pretty sure that's the problem.	Yaqa segurom kani chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
It must be recognized.	Riqsisqa kanan.
He said he did not do this.	Payqa nirqam mana kayta ruwasqayta.
Very smart, right?.	Ancha yachaysapa, ¿aw?.
Why, of course.	Imarayku, sut'inmi.
Lots of ideas there.	Achka yuyayniyuq chaypi.
You don’t know what to ask.	Manam yachankichu imata tapuyta.
Probably still does.	Yaqapaschá kunankamapas ruwan.
Let me know if you want to.	Munaspaqa willaway.
Did you know anything about him.	¿Imatapas paymanta yacharqankichu.
But that is not the case now though.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kunan ichaqa.
Now it wasn’t good enough.	Kunanqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s harder, not better.	Aswan sasa, mana aswan allinchu.
He looked at his house.	Wasinta qhawarisqa.
He was always going to be there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi kanan karqa.
They seemed rather sad and angry.	Paykunaqa aswan llakisqa hinaspa phiñasqa hinam karqaku.
So be sure of it.	Chaymi seguro kay.
Everyone is serious.	Lliwmi serio kanku.
He failed miserably.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Saying I'm sorry.	Pampachaykuway niyta.
There is no point in doing this.	Kayta ruwayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
You can’t have it now.	Kunanqa manan chayta tariyta atiwaqchu.
For the sake of that thing.	Chay imapas allin kananpaq.
I was so excited to do this.	Ancha kusisqam tarikurqani kayta ruwanaypaq.
Afternoon, a weekday.	Tarde, huk semana punchaw.
Again, this can be good or bad.	Yapamanta, kayqa allin utaq mana allin kanman.
It’s probably safe.	Yaqapaschá seguro kashan.
It wasn’t the last time.	Manas qhipa kutichu karqa.
One of them was fired.	Hukninmi qarqusqa karqa.
He always wants to be good.	Payqa sapa kutim allin kayta munan.
I didn’t expect to see it.	Manam suyarqanichu qawayta.
But maybe that would have been everything.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa tukuy imapas kanman karqan.
If you think you can do better, do it.	Sichus aswan allinta ruwayta atisqaykita yuyaykunki chayqa, ruway.
There is nothing you can do here.	Kaypiqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That’s it, at least.	Chayqa, aswanpas.
How do you tell me.	Imaynatataq willaway.
It was often absent.	Sapa kutim mana karqachu.
You can't think about this.	Kaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
He spoke sternly.	Payqa sinchitan rimarqan.
It may be very difficult.	Ichapas sinchi sasa kanman.
He put a lot of thought into it.	Payqa anchatan yuyaykurqan chay ruwaypi.
That person should be.	Chay runa kanan.
He was sad and depressed.	Payqa llakisqa, sinchi llakisqa ima kasqa.
It looks very, very nice.	Ancha ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
It was a great time.	Hatun tiempon karqan.
I feel like a terrible person.	Manchay runa hinam tarikuni.
Maybe this is true.	Ichapas kayqa chiqap kanman.
I don’t want to walk away from it at all.	Manam chaymantaqa puriyta munanichu ni imapipas.
And indeed, we agree that it is.	Hinaspa chiqap, acuerdopi kayku chayna kasqanmanta.
The patient.	Unqusqa.
He could have done it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayta ruwayta atinman karqan.
No, it was no longer useful.	Manan, manañan imapaqpas allinchu karqan.
Do the things and activities you love.	Munasqayki ruwaykunata, ruwaykunata ima ruway.
He always wanted to sleep.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi puñuyta munarqan.
He refused to understand.	Payqa manan entiendeyta munarqanchu.
Now he can’t stop walking.	Kunanqa manaña puriyta saqiyta atinchu.
That's it, thanks!.	Chayllam, gracias!.
Very beautiful, awesome, awesome!!!.	Ancha sumaq, manchay, manchay!!!.
I want to make some money.	Wakin qullqita tariyta munani.
And he was in a state of shock.	Hinan payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
The lowest, actually.	Aswan pisi kaq, chiqaptaqa.
But this is the latter.	Ichaqa kay qhepa kaqmi.
Most people have no idea.	Yaqa llapan runakunam mana ima yuyayniyuqchu kanku.
As good as the first.	Ñawpaq kaq hina allin ruway.
It wasn’t a real day.	Manam chiqap punchawchu karqa.
He didn’t want to remember.	Payqa manan yuyariyta munarqanchu.
Three days and three nights.	Kimsa punchaw kimsa tuta.
Run the game.	Ruway pukllayta.
I am always on time.	Sapa kutim tiempollanpi kachkani.
And it would do that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanman.
But the truth is.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaq.
Know who they are.	Pikuna kasqankuta yachay.
He couldn’t remember anyone ever saying that.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu hayk’aqpas pipas chayta nisqanmanta.
So, this is part of that.	Chaymi, kayqa chaymanta hukninmi.
I think maybe one is angry.	Yuyaykuni ichapas huk phiñasqa kanman.
People are not happy.	Runakunaqa manam kusisqachu kanku.
Maybe you knew that.	Ichapas chayta yacharqanki.
Like this time around.	Kay kutipi hina.
It’s the worst thing I can do.	Aswan mana allin ruwaymi ñuqapaq.
This guy is a good guy.	Kay runaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
You always think everything can wait.	Sapa kutim yuyanki tukuy imapas suyayta atinman.
Why, we cannot say.	Imarayku, mana niyta atichwanchu.
He knew better anyway.	Payqa aswan allintam yacharqa imayna kaptinpas.
No one here could have done that.	Kaypiqa manam pipas chaynataqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqa.
He can’t wait.	Payqa manan suyayta atinchu.
I knew he would pass on this story.	Yacharqanim kay willakuyta pasananta.
This one went on.	Kayqa rirqa.
Not me, not yet.	Manam ñuqachu, manaraqmi.
He can’t sleep.	Manam puñuyta atinchu.
I hope you do well in school.	Yachay wasipi allinta ruwanaykipaqmi suyachkani.
I didn't think it was.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kaptinqa.
Young, unmarried.	Wayna, mana casarasqa.
You said that the other night.	Chaynatam huk tuta nirqanki.
But it’s been around for a long time.	Ichaqa unayñan kashan.
He died three months later.	Payqa kinsa killa qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
I thought it was there.	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I thought it would be more like there.	Aswan chaypi hina kananta yuyaykurqani.
You don't look like a mistake.	Manam pantasqa hinachu rikchakunki.
I mean, he's alone in it.	Niyta munani, payqa sapallanmi chaypi kachkan.
So not much here.	Chaymi mana anchatachu kaypi.
The next step is obvious.	Chay qatiqnin ruwayqa sut’inmi.
However, it’s not really working.	Ichaqa, manan cheqaqtachu llank’ashan.
This would be a one-time event.	Kayqa huk kutilla ruwaymi kanman.
People were people.	Runakunaqa runakunam karqaku.
That means you can believe just about anything.	Chayqa niyta munan yaqa tukuy imapipas creeyta atisqaykita.
What is this likely to be? 	¿Imaynataq kay kanman?
But he would be half.	Ichaqa payqa kuskan kanman.
He was excited about it.	Payqa chaymanta kusisqa kasqa.
Of course, this is not easy.	Arí, kayqa manan facilchu.
I think now is the right time.	Yuyaykuni kunanqa allin pacha kasqanmanta.
It may take three days.	Kimsa punchawmi kanman.
He says it was just in time.	Payqa ninmi tiempollanpi chayna kasqanmanta.
He thought of something.	Payqa imapipas yuyaykurqanmi.
She is a black, very beautiful girl.	Payqa yana, ancha sumaq sipasmi.
That is why he knows everything.	Chayraykum payqa tukuy imatapas yachan.
I hope we don’t have to.	Suyachkani manaña chayta ruwanaykupaq.
You’ll think about it later.	Qhepamanmi chaypi yuyaykunki.
I’m tired of it.	Sayk’usqañan kashani.
So, accordingly.	Chaymi, chayman hina.
I was there one day.	Huk punchawmi karqani.
Nothing could do that.	Manam imapas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqachu.
But you go really fast.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin usqhaylla rinki.
Then he went outside.	Chaymantam hawaman lluqsirqa.
In fact, it is probably the best.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá aswan allinqa.
But they are not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanku.
That was all you had.	Chayllam qampaq karqa.
He couldn't be there, at home.	Payqa manam chaypi kayta atirqachu, wasipi.
And he said to me, yes.	Hinaspa niwarqa, arí.
I guess that's the only problem.	Suyachkani chaylla sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
So that was a challenge.	Chaymi chayqa sasachakuy karqa.
I'm really new at this.	Chiqaptam musuq kani kaypi.
And there’s something there.	Hinaspa chaypiqa imapas kachkan.
What you have done to me, what you have done.	Imatachus ñuqawan ruwasqaykita, imatachus ruwasqaykita.
And now he was.	Hinaspa kunanqa payqa karqan.
I didn’t want to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
I saw this once before.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk kutitam kayta rikurqani.
He’s been injured for quite some time.	Payqa allin unayñam k’irisqa kasqanmanta.
It was amazing, really amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi karqa, chiqap admirakuypaqmi karqa.
that’s what he wants.	chaynatam munan.
Go for a walk with me.	Riy ñuqawan puriq.
If you think that, you’re really crazy.	Sichus chayta yuyaykunki chayqa, cheqaqtapunin loco kanki.
She knows he wants her to.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwananta munasqanmanta.
Everything was a process.	Tukuy imapas huk ruwaymi karqa.
I immediately agreed to do so.	Chayllam chayta ruwanaypaq arí nirqani.
I never knew why he was there.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa chaypi kasqanmanta.
The most frightened.	Aswan mancharisqa.
I thought I would never go to school again.	Yuyarqanim manaña haykapipas escuelaman rinaypaq.
A man opened the door.	Huk runam punkuta kicharirqa.
I wanted to answer.	Kutichiyta munarqani.
I can’t watch it.	Manam qawayta atiymanchu.
The responsibility is much larger.	Chay ruwayqa aswan hatunmi.
Makes a great gift.	Hatun regalota ruwan.
To be beautiful.	Sumaq kananpaq.
He always did what he wanted.	Payqa sapa kutim munasqanman hina ruwaq.
This, at least, is easy.	Kayqa, aswanpas, facilmi.
So that means people are stupid.	Chaymi chayqa niyta munan runakunaqa sonso kasqankuta.
I'm kind of proud of you, actually.	Ñuqaqa huk laya orgulloso kani qammanta, chiqaptaqa.
It just wasn't set up properly.	Chaylla mana allintachu churasqa karqa.
No, you, if you want to.	Manan, qan, munaspaqa.
So that’s a problem.	Chaymi chayqa sasachakuy.
That would be the best thing to do.	Chayqa aswan allin ruwaymi kanman.
Great appearance.	Hatun rikchayniyuq.
Like, really, really happy.	Imayna, chiqap, chiqap kusisqa.
That is a difficult task, however.	Chayqa sasa ruwaymi ichaqa.
And here was a chance.	Hinaspa kaypi huk chansa karqan.
I still don’t see it.	Kunankamapas manam rikunichu.
I couldn’t stop with that.	Chaywanqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu.
I really can’t tell you.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atiymanchu.
I still thought nothing of it.	Kunankamapas manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu.
We talked about anything and everything.	Imamantapas tukuy imamantapas rimaq kayku.
That is why it is my responsibility to talk about it.	Chayraykum ñuqapa ruwanay kachkan chaymanta rimanaypaq.
He was a good guy, he said.	Payqa allinmi kasqa, nispa.
He’s a good player though.	Payqa allin pukllaqmi ichaqa.
There they are, night after night.	Chaypim kachkanku, tutamanta tuta.
If anything, he’s .	Sichus imapas kanman chayqa, payqa .
They are here every day.	Sapa punchawmi kaypi kachkanku.
I do this fairly often.	Kaytaqa allin sapa kutim ruwani.
I am outside most of the day.	Yaqa tukuy punchawmi hawapi kachkani.
I want to get here.	Kayman chayayta munani.
I could do it all over again.	Tukuy chayta hukmanta ruwayman.
One of them spoke to you.	Hukninmi qanwan rimarqan.
This is a constant process.	Kayqa sapa kutilla ruwaymi.
That’s easier for me.	Chayqa aswan facilmi ñuqapaq.
But it was good to talk about him.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa paymanta rimayqa.
He’s great at that.	Payqa chaypiqa hatunmi.
Forgive me, yes .	Pampachaykuway, arí .
Never thought to ask where.	Mana hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu maypi tapuyta.
Maybe doing nothing was a good thing.	Ichapas mana imatapas ruwayqa allinpaq karqa.
That was really easy.	Chayqa chiqap facilmi karqa.
I know what it takes to do that.	Yachanim chay ruwanapaq imakuna ruwana kasqanmanta.
We’re lucky that we did.	Suerteyoqmi kayku chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
You’ll find out later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi yachanki.
You can’t walk away.	Mana puriyta atiwaqchu.
The evil man.	Millay runa.
Being the current one.	Kunan kaq kay.
More never, less often.	Aswan mana hayk’aqpas, aswan pisi sapa kuti.
Once a villain, always a villain.	Huk kuti millay runa, sapa kuti millay runa.
Hungry, hungry.	Yarqaymanta, yarqaymanta.
Human, or at least human-like.	Runa, utaq aswanpas runa hina.
He had to act very quickly.	Payqa ancha utqayllam imatapas ruwanan karqa.
It looked like it would work.	Chayqa allinta ruwanman hinam rikchakurqa.
You’ll be better off than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanki.
I would be very present for that.	Chaypaqqa anchatam chaypi kayman.
He has to be there.	Payqa chaypi kanan tiyan.
I don’t want to be too serious.	Manam munanichu llumpayta serio kayta.

You’re doing it.	Chaytaqa ruwachkanki.
No one was that good.	Manan pipas chay hina allinchu karqan.
I would love to be out there.	Anchatam munani chay hawapi kayta.
The process fails.	Chay ruwayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
No, he was nobody.	Manan, payqa manan pipas karqanchu.
I knew how to fix it.	Yacharqanim imayna allichayta.
Half of the half.	Kuska kuskan.
He can’t get away with it now.	Manam kunanqa chaymanta lluqsiyta atinchu.
However, everyone is guilty of it.	Ichaqa, chaypiqa llapallankum huchayoq kanku.
I'd rather not.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chayna kananpaq.
He was angry the last time.	Payqa qhipa kutipi phiñasqa kasqa.
But in the summer.	Ichaqa verano killapin.
Otherwise, it would be bad.	Mana chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
I mean, yeah, sort of.	Niyta munani, arí, huk laya.
Not all wealth is available.	Manan llapa qhapaq kaychu tarikun.
Maybe he can make it.	Ichapas payqa chayayta atinman.
A man who has been exiled from another country.	Huk llaqtamanta qarqusqa runa.
He had no choice but to accept it.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, aswanpas chaytan chaskirqan.
Yes, he is as impressed as you are.	Arí, payqa qan hina admirasqa kashan.
I didn’t think much of it.	Manam anchatachu piensarqani.
Not here, he wanted to say.	Mana kaypichu, nispas niyta munarqa.
Yes, this is one.	Arí, kaymi huk.
I went to high school here.	Kaypi hatun yachay wasiman rirqani.
I think it’s better this way.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi yuyaykuni.
I still haven't been able to watch the movie.	Kunankamapas manam chay peliculata qawayta atirqanichu.
He may not want to do that.	Manapaschá chayta ruwayta munanmanchu.
I'm not sure it ever will.	Manam segurochu kani haykapipas chayna kananta.
No one could reach it.	Manam pipas chaymanqa chayayta atirqachu.
He’s finally happy.	Payqa tukukuypi kusisqa kachkan.
And that was pretty much it.	Hinaspa chaymi yaqa chayna karqa.
I didn't see it today though.	Kunan punchawmi ichaqa mana rikurqanichu.
Say it won’t work.	Mana allinchu kanqa nispa niy.
But it was neither here nor there.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu karqan.
This is often an unhappy situation.	Kayqa sapa kutim mana kusisqachu tarikun.
We made a homey meal.	Wasipi hina mikhunata ruwarqayku.
It will be ready soon.	Pisi tiempollamantan listoña kanqa.
It’s all very sad.	Tukuy imapas ancha llakikuypaqmi.
That’s a great thing.	Chayqa hatun imapas.
Without that, everything went wrong.	Chay mana allin kaptinqa tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
That was so hard not having you.	Chayqa ancha sasa karqan qanwan mana kayqa.
This is how it was supposed to be.	Kay hinam kanan karqa.
So, he says, he is.	Chaymi, nispas nin.
I might as well.	Ñuqapas ichapas.
I look forward to talking to you again tomorrow.	Suyachkani paqarin hukmanta qamwan rimayta.
I really want nothing.	Mana imatapas anchatam munani.
The sooner you do this the better.	Aswan utqaylla kayta ruwanki chayqa aswan allinmi.
It’s the best way to do that.	Chaypaqqa aswan allinmi.
He doesn’t want to be misunderstood.	Payqa manan mana allintachu entiendeyta munan.
I know you are not mad at me.	Yachanim mana ñuqawan phiñasqa kasqaykita.
He was a stupid guy.	Payqa sonso kasqa.
An innocent young man.	Mana huchayoq wayna.
Less people, more time.	Aswan pisi runakuna, aswan tiempo.
What a great time.	Ima hatun pacha.
This process happened several times.	Kay ruwayqa achka kutitam pasarqa.
I can’t do it any other way.	Manam huk hina ruwayta atiymanchu.
It was the stranger.	Chay mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
Everyone was frustrated and angry.	Lliwmi hukmanyasqa hinaspa phiñasqa karqaku.
I still really do.	Kunankamapas chiqaptam ruwani.
That’s what he meant.	Chaytan niyta munarqan.
I think that’s the best way to do it.	Chayqa aswan allin ruwaymi kanman nispan yuyaykuni.
There was only one thing to do.	Chayllam ruwana karqa.
And so he’s gone.	Hinaspa chayna payqa manaña kanchu.
But I don’t care who he is.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu pi kasqanmantaqa.
The wicked people! 	¡Millay runakuna!
I’m afraid not for very long at all.	Manchakuni mana ancha unaytachu ni imapipas.
Do it anywhere in the world.	Chaytaqa maypipas kay pachapi ruway.
I hope he did.	Suyachkani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
It’s there for something.	Imapaqpas kanmi.
No, it’s really bad.	Mana, chiqap mana allinchu.
But this doesn’t work well.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allintachu ruwan.
It's really not that hard.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna sasachu.
Thank you, that’s wonderful.	Gracias, chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
It’s harder now, there you go.	Aswan sasa kunan, chaypi rinki.
I'm looking for something more.	Aswan imatapas maskachkani.
But it’s busy.	Ichaqa ocupasqa kashan.
I want to play the game.	Pukllayta munani.
Wrong, how wrong it was.	Pantasqa, imayna pantasqa kasqa.
I knew nothing about what had happened.	Chay pasasqanmantaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
Surely now was the time for him to say something.	Cheqaqtapunin kunan tiempo karqan imatapas rimananpaq.
But it’s not good for you.	Ichaqa manan allinchu qanpaq.
It’s more hidden.	Aswan pakasqa kachkan.
I thought it was pretty safe.	Allin seguro kananpaqmi piensarqani.
I think of it as a challenge.	Chaytaqa huk sasachakuy hinam piensani.
But it was never true.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
I don’t hear it right.	Manam allintachu uyarini.
Maybe one day he will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayta ruwanman.
I haven’t done this in a long time.	Unayñan mana kayta ruwarqanichu.
He is usually smart.	Yaqa llapanpim yachaysapa.
Bigger than me, anyway.	Aswan hatun ñuqamanta, imayna kaptinpas.
They were prison giants.	Paykunaqa carcelpi hatun runakunam karqaku.
I wasn’t good enough for that.	Manam chaypaqqa allinchu karqani.
Anywhere, it always would have been.	Maypipas, sapa kutim chayna kanman karqa.
Nothing can go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanman.
It looked sad.	Chayqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Everything meant no more than one thing.	Tukuy imapas mana hukmanta aswan niyta munarqa.
Where the problem is not included.	Sasachakuy mana churasqa kasqanpi.
But you didn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwarqanki.
There was nothing funny about it, after all.	Manam imapas asikunapaq karqachu, tukuy imamanta.
Everything was great, at the time.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi karqa, chay tiempopiqa.
That’s the main thing here.	Chayqa kaypiqa aswan hatun ruwaymi.
It’s midnight.	Kuska tutam kachkan.
And you’re lucky he is.	Hinaspa suerteyoqmi kanki payqa.
And this other person.	Hinaspa kay huknin runa.
This came from the past.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi hamurqan.
Couldn’t be happier!.	¡Manan aswan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu!.
He didn't look like much.	Payqa manam anchatachu rikchakurqa.
I'm really excited about this.	Chiqaptam anchata kusikuni kaymanta.
It was a cruel thing to do.	Chayqa huk millay ruwaymi karqa.
He kind of wished he wouldn't.	Payqa huk laya munarqa mana chayta ruwananta.
So far we agree.	Kunankamaqa acuerdopi kayku.
And, yes, sad.	Hinaspa, arí, llakisqa.
Yeah, it’s not a bad thing.	Arí, manam mana allinchu.
Where? 	Maypi?
That they are both.	Chay iskayninku kasqankuta.
Tom was right, after all.	Tomqa allintan rimarqan, tukuy imamanta.
It is very easy to do.	Ancha facilmi ruwayqa.
He was already like that.	Payqa ñam chayna kasqa.
He obviously knows.	Payqa sut’inmi yachan.
You’re not doing it right.	Mana allintachu ruwachkanki.
It wouldn’t have been good.	Mana allinchu kanman karqan.
So it should be the best.	Chaymi aswan allinqa kanan.
But how come I don’t know.	Ichaqa imaynatataq mana yachanichu.
It was a pretty easy thing to do.	Chayqa huk allin facil ruwaymi karqa.
In fact, this would be better.	Aswanpas kayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He reported that he had done well.	Paymi willarqan allinta ruwasqanmanta.
He doesn’t care what it is.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imachus kasqanmantaqa.
He learned to drive a second time.	Iskay kaq kutipi carrota manejayta yacharqa.
People are hurting.	Runakunaqa k’irisqa kashanku.
So the guy said.	Chaymi chay runaqa nisqa.
Someone that.	Pipas chayta.
Everything is fine in this ending though.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kay tukukuypi ichaqa.
Hopefully this isn't a big deal for you.	Munaymanmi kayqa mana hatun ruwaychu qampaq.
When you say one thing and mean another.	Hukta nispa hukta niyta munaspaqa.

Please say something.	Ama hina kaspa imatapas niy.
Really, really sad.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta llakisqa.
He was pretty sure.	Payqa yaqapaschá seguro kasharqan.
It's still not that bad.	Kunankamapas manam chayna mana allinchu.
Several days passed.	Achka punchawmi pasarqa.
You’re doing well.	Allinmi kachkanki.
He was tired and hungry.	Payqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa kasqa.
Maybe you do, too.	Ichapas qampas.
Which was fine with him.	Imataq allin karqa paywan.
Which is all right.	Imataq tukuy allin kachkan.
These are terrible people.	Kaykunaqa manchay runakunam.
If it can work, he said.	Llank’ayta atinmanchu chayqa nispa.
That’s a duality.	Chayqa iskay kaymi.
So go tell me who you are.	Chaymi riy, willaway pi kasqaykita.
He left her here as a foolish child.	Mana yuyayniyuq wawa kaypi saqirqa.
He came three days later.	Payqa kinsa p’unchay qhepamanmi hamurqan.
I was part of it.	Ñuqaqa chaymantam karqani.
Share your thoughts.	Imayna yuyaykusqaykita willay.
No one can stop it.	Manan pipas hark'ayta atinmanchu.
How about this	Imaynataq kay .
And very, very smart.	Hinaspa ancha, ancha yachaysapa.
But not together, no.	Ichaqa manan kuskachu, manan.
I’m doing better.	Aswan allinta ruwachkani.
It depends on how good it is.	Imayna allin kasqanmantam kanqa.
He didn’t say many funny things.	Payqa manan askha asikunapaq hinachu rimaq.
It really goes there!.	¡Cheqaqtapunin chayman rin!.
It was the first of its kind.	Chayqa karqan chay hina ñawpaq kaqmi.
Forgive me, great man.	Pampachaykuway, hatun runa.
I couldn’t bear to leave it to anyone but you know that.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu pimanpas saqiyta ichaqa qam chayta yachanki.
It’s not really a big deal.	Manam chiqap hatun ruwaychu.
Perhaps this evening.	Ichapas kay chisi pachapi.
It gets lonely, sometimes.	Sapallanmi tarikun, wakin kuti.
But doing so is another matter.	Ichaqa chayta ruwayqa huk ruwaymi.
I never did nothing.	Manam haykapipas mana imatapas ruwarqanichu.
Be comfortable with him.	Paywan allinta kay.
No, he’s not the only one wrong.	Manan, manan sapallanchu pantasqa.
Some of this, some of that.	Wakin kay, wakin chaymanta.
So, if you know.	Chaymi, yachanki chayqa.
Maybe he doesn’t want to say anything.	Ichapas mana imatapas rimayta munanmanchu.
One was quick to react.	Hukninmi chaylla imatapas ruwaq.
Today was a wonderful day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
If not worse.	Mana aswan mana allin kaptinqa.
I know, it’s hard.	Yachanim, sasam.
Maybe this summer.	Ichapas kay chiri killapi.
No, of course, it will be tomorrow.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin, paqarin p’unchay kanqa.
The result was a failure.	Chay ruwasqanqa manan atirqanchu.
That’s a really important thing.	Chayqa ancha importante kaqmi.
Therefore, the process takes a long time.	Chayraykum chay ruwayqa unayta ruwana.
And do it twice.	Hinaspa iskay kutita ruway.
She really wanted to be with him.	Payqa anchatan munarqan paywan kayta.
Sure enough, he wanted to ask.	Seguro, payqa tapuyta munarqa.
That's like being crazy.	Chayqa loco kay hinam.
There’s almost nothing he won’t do.	Yaqa mana imapas kanchu mana ruwananpaqqa.
Everyone should be protected.	Sapa runam pakasqa kanan.
I felt uncomfortable with it.	Chaywanmi mana allintachu tarikurqani.
I didn’t want to hear any more.	Manam astawan uyariyta munarqanichu.
Sorry, it's not ready.	Pampachaykuway, manam listochu kachkan.
Goodness knows why.	Allin kayqa yachanmi imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That’s not the best way.	Chayqa manan aswan allinchu.
Would you like to tell me more about it ?.	¿Chaymanta astawan willayta munankichu ?.
It is a good thing to do.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwana.
So that was the big thing.	Chaymi chay hatun kaq karqa.
But he couldn’t, not at all.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu, manan ni imapipas.
So they know it.	Chaymi paykunaqa yachanku.
I can’t remember why.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
What you’re doing now.	Kunan ruwasqaykita.
But this was not a man.	Ichaqa kayqa manam runachu karqa.
Please do this for me.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta ruway.
He really wants to be.	Payqa anchatam kayta munan.
There was nothing anyone could do.	Manam imatapas pipas ruway atirqachu.
But this is completely wrong.	Ichaqa kayqa llapanpim pantasqa kachkan.
Surely this man can do better than that.	Cheqaqtapunin kay runaqa chaymanta aswan allinta ruwayta atinman.
He looks very sad and sick.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinaspa unqusqa hinam rikchakun.
That there’s never been anyone else.	Mana hayk’aqpas huk runa kasqanmanta.
Something big black.	Imapas hatun yana.
Everyone was crazy.	Lliwmi loco karqa.
Worse, he wasn't alone.	Aswan mana allinqa, manam sapallanchu karqa.
Anyway, now there is someone.	Imayna kaptinpas, kunanqa pipas kanmi.
I’ll go, well, with anyone.	Risaq, allinmi, piwanpas.
It’s easier to be tough.	Aswan facilmi sinchi kayqa.
All summer went by.	Tukuy verano pasarqa.
He has an idea.	Payqa huk yuyayniyuqmi.
They were both happy.	Iskayninkum kusisqa karqaku.
Outside the world.	Kay pacha hawapi.
Whatever he wants.	Ima munasqantapas.
He was not happy.	Payqa manam kusisqachu tarikurqa.
Actually it is not enough.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayllachu.
It is day and night.	Chayqa tuta punchawmi.
He said he could not tolerate such behavior.	Paymi nirqa chayna ruwaykunata mana aguantayta atisqanmanta.
I don’t want to dwell on it too much.	Manam munanichu chaypi llumpayta yuyaymanayta.
I was always the best.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim aswan allin karqani.
A performance every night.	Sapa tutan huk ruway.
However, this may not be the right approach.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay ruwayqa allinchu kanman.
I didn’t see anyone.	Mana pitapas rikurqanichu.
He is out there with me every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi ñuqawan hawapi kachkan.
I'm sorry, I don't.	Pampachaykuway, manam.
But that would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I'll do better.	Aswan allintam ruwasaq.
The human half.	Runa kuskan.
Yeah, and eat, that’s fine.	Arí, hinaspa mikhuy, chayqa allinmi.
They want the final answer.	Paykunaqa qhipa kutichiyta munanku.
He wanted to get a job, he said.	Payqa llamkayta tariyta munarqa, nispa.
Yeah, they’re tough, okay.	Arí, paykunaqa sinchi kanku, allinmi.
It’s not good people, it’s not good.	Mana allinchu runakuna, mana allinchu.
He tried, but failed.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi, ichaqa mana allintachu ruwarqan.
Do this regularly.	Chaytaqa sapa kutilla ruway.
This does what it’s supposed to do.	Kayqa ruwanan kaqta ruwan.
That 's yours	Chayqa qampa .
I need to be better and smarter.	Aswan allin, aswan yachaysapa kanay.
And now everything is fine again.	Hinaspa kunanqa tukuy imapas yapamanta allinmi.
But it could have been.	Ichaqa chayna kanman karqa.
But the food is terrible.	Ichaqa mikhuy manchay.
This will probably take about a month.	Chaypaqqa yaqapaschá huk killa hina kanqa.
There would have been three.	Kimsa kanman karqa.
I didn't think he could.	Manam piensarqanichu atisqanmanta.
It was a month ago.	Huk killa kasqa.
This is not unreasonable.	Kayqa manam mana yuyayniyuqchu.
Maybe he won’t.	Ichapas mana ruwanqachu.
Most of the time, it was wrong.	Yaqa llapanpim mana allinchu karqa.
You still look ugly.	Hinallam millay rikchakunki.
I still want things.	Hinallam imakunatapas munani.
No one was sure.	Manam pipas segurochu karqa.
Like most of the time.	Yaqa llapan tiempopi hina.
No one could understand that.	Chaytan mana pipas entiendeyta atirqanchu.
It’s not like it’s for me.	Mana ñuqapaq hinachu.
Everyone needs it.	Sapa runam necesitan.
I hope you did better.	Suyachkani aswan allin ruwasqaykita.
This is posted .	Kayqa churasqa kachkan .
They know how to play well.	Paykunaqa allinta pukllayta yachanku.
A knowledge, a true knowledge.	Huk yachay, chiqap yachay.
Still, it is difficult.	Chayna kaptinpas sasam.
It’s beautiful, it’s very beautiful.	Sumaqmi, ancha sumaqmi.
He looked very uncomfortable.	Payqa ancha mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I think it’s there.	Yuyaykuni chaypi kasqanmanta.
I have no idea what happened at the time.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani chay tiempopi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
They weren’t the best.	Paykunaqa manan aswan allinchu karqanku.
I’m not really going there.	Manam chiqaptachu chaymanqa risaq.
Maybe you want to check it out.	Ichapas chayta qawayta munanki.
No house, no house, no.	Mana wasi, mana wasi, mana.
Either you knew that or you didn’t.	Icha chayta yacharqanki icha mana.
Many great people.	Achka hatun runakuna.
All over there somewhere.	Tukuy chaypi maypipas.
He didn’t want to be disappointed.	Payqa manan munarqanchu hukmanyasqa kayta.
This is such crazy stuff.	Kayqa chayna loco kaymi.
He certainly spoke the truth.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin cheqaqta rimarqan.
Maybe it’s not difficult.	Ichapas mana sasachu kanman.
The coffee was cold.	Chay kukata chiri kasqa.
I was too hard for you one day.	Huk punchawmi llumpayta sinchita qampaq karqani.
But one expects the task to be more difficult.	Ichaqa huk runaqa suyanmi chay ruwayqa aswan sasa kananta.
I always wanted more.	Sapa kutim aswan achkata munarqani.
In fact, it probably is.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chayna.
He shouldn’t be in a hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu kanan.
And man, was it hard.	Hinaspa runa, sasachu karqa.
Now he is doing better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam ruwachkan.
I’m angry and upset.	Phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kani.
That means being positive.	Chayqa niyta munan allin yuyayniyuq kaymi.
He went anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas rirqa.
He was scared and angry.	Payqa mancharisqa, phiñasqa ima kasharqan.
They are a big deal.	Paykunaqa hatun ruwaymi kanku.
What happened to me.	Imataq ñuqawan pasarqa.
He wanted to buy time.	Tiempota rantiyta munarqa.
He didn't need that to happen.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu chayna kananta.
That's an important thing.	Chayqa huk importante kaqmi.
What is the wrong thing?.	¿Imataq mana allin?.
I really don't know much about him.	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu paymanta yachani.
Maybe for the better.	Ichapas aswan allin kananpaq.
This is the third morning.	Kaymi kimsa kaq paqarin.
They are all foolish.	Llapallankum mana yuyayniyuq kanku.
He knew the language well.	Payqa allintan yacharqan chay simita.
They were first and second.	Paykunaqa ñawpaq kaq, iskay kaq ima karqanku.
You just want to do it.	Chaylla ruwayta munanki.
Like a big problem.	Hatun sasachakuy hina.
But this was better.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
I can't understand why.	Manam entiendeyta atinichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
You know what they look like.	Yachankim imayna rikchayniyuq kasqankuta.
I really want to stay.	Anchatan munani qhepakuyta.
You’ll be there for two days.	Iskay punchawmi kanki.
I didn’t want to be that person.	Manam chay runa kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I thought you wanted to know.	Yachayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I was pretty sure it wasn’t.	Yaqapaschá seguro karqani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I wanted to look pretty.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq kaytam munarqani.
I don't want to make too much out of this.	Kaymantaqa manam anchatachu ruwayta munani.
A week went by, then two.	Huk semana pasarqa, chaymanta iskay.
Yes, that quickly.	Arí, chayta usqhaylla.
But that’s not what he’s thinking here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu chayta yuyaykushan.
No, baby, you’re fine.	Manan, wawa, allinmi kashanki.
It should have been by now.	Kunankamaqa kanan karqan.
There’s seriousness.	Chaypin kashan serio.
Don't do anything now.	Kunanqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
There is a lot going on here.	Kaypiqa achka ruwaymi kachkan.
But no, it was there.	Ichaqa manam, chaypim karqa.
Everyone was ready.	Lliwmi listo karqaku.
Can you do better?.	¿Atiwaqchu aswan allinta ruwayta?.
Unfortunately, this is not unique.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa manam sapallanchu.
He seems surprised.	Payqa admirasqa hinam kachkan.
But if you want to talk anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas rimayta munaspaqa.
No one needed to say anything.	Manan pipas imatapas niyta necesitarqanchu.
I’m worried he’s out there, hurt.	Llakisqa kachkani hawapi kasqanmanta, k’irisqa.
This whole thing.	Kay tukuy imapas.
That was kind of surprising.	Chayqa huk laya admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It should be like the other one.	Huknin hinam kanan.
I don't care if he can catch it or not.	Manam imananpaschu hapiyta atinmanchu icha manachu.
Otherwise everything seems fine.	Mana chayqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
It was a very bad thing to do.	Ancha mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
It’s very cold here.	Kaypiqa ancha chiri.
Yes, they were sad and worried.	Arí, paykunaqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima karqanku.
Sure sure sure.	Seguro seguro seguro.
I am very happy with that.	Chaywanqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
All easy going.	Tukuy facil puriq.
Obviously, he’s doing a terrific job of it.	Sut’inmi, payqa manchay llank’ayta ruwashan chaymanta.
And black people.	Chaymanta yana runakuna.
Now, at least, he didn’t have to pretend.	Kunanqa, aswanpas, manañan hinachu ruwanan karqan.
It should have been so easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi kanan karqa.
It just was more than this.	Chayllam kaymanta aswan achka karqa.
I have a real sense of humor.	Ñuqaqa chiqap yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He had to keep doing it.	Payqa hinallam ruwanan karqa.
I just didn't think about it.	Chayllam mana piensarqanichu.
He was supposed to be rich and evil.	Payqa qhapaq, millay runa kanan karqan.
You seem to be fine.	Allintam rikchakunki.
But it really doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana imananpaschu.
And what about you? 	Hinaspa, ¿imataq qanmanta?
But it’s bigger.	Ichaqa aswan hatun.
But he does it well.	Ichaqa allintam chaytaqa ruwan.
It looked really good.	Chiqap allinmi rikchakurqa.
More intelligent.	Aswan yuyayniyuq.
He thought he might try to convince her otherwise.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi huk hinata convencechiyta munanman nispa.
These are the ones.	Chaykunataqa.
There are many people here.	Kaypim achka runakuna tarikun.
Yeah, and then some.	Arí, chaymanta wakin.
But one fine day things will go wrong.	Ichaqa huk sumaq punchawmi imapas mana allinchu kanqa.
It was better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi karqa.
Maybe the second would be better.	Ichapas iskay kaq aswan allin kanman.
Who knows, it could have just been a bad day.	Pi yachan, chayllaraqmi mana allin punchaw kanman karqa.
He went outside.	Payqa hawaman lluqsirqa.
You don’t know what it’s like.	Manan yachankichu imayna kasqanta.
He was expelled.	Payqa qarqusqa karqan.
Everything but me.	Tukuy imapas mana ñuqallachu.
But that would be a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi kanman.
Once again, at least.	Huk kutipi, aswanpas.
This behavior can rather be seen as absurd.	Kay ruwayqa aswanpas mana yuyayniyuq hina qhawarisqa kanman.
That was the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
Anyway, he could never say no.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam haykapipas mana niyta atirqachu.
That’s the best thing here.	Chayqa kaypiqa aswan allinmi.
That may come in handy later.	Chayqa qhepamanmi allin kanman.
He wants to know.	Yachayta munan.
Everything went wrong, and it still does.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa, kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
He was pretty sure he knew it.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan chayta yachasqanmanta.
It’s very, very good.	Ancha ancha allinmi.
That’s going to be me.	Chayqa ñuqa kasaq.
He was tired the night before.	Payqa ñawpaq tutan sayk’usqa kasqa.
You do this dozens of times every night.	Chaytaqa sapa tutan chunka chunka kutita ruwanki.
That’s where I thought, though.	Chaypin ichaqa yuyaykurqani.
But it will have to be late.	Ichaqa tarde kanan kanqa.
Now he is not so sure.	Kunanqa manañam chayna segurochu kachkan.
This is not good though.	Kayqa manam allinchu ichaqa.
This meant yes.	Kayqa arí niyta munarqa.
He doesn’t need to go alone.	Manan sapallanchu riyta necesitan.
I was there yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi chaypi karqani.
And that’s the worst part.	Hinaspa chayqa aswan mana allinmi.
It’s like nothing else.	Mana imapas kanman hina.
That’s not always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
But, and this important.	Ichaqa, hinaspa kay importante.
I’m doing amazing things.	Admirakuypaqmi ruwachkani.
It doesn’t mean it’s not true.	Manam niyta munanchu mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
But it still has to be.	Ichaqa chayraqmi kanan.
Better yet, this was better.	Aswan allinmi, kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Maybe ten years.	Ichapas chunka wata.
The sad man.	Llakisqa runa.
He is no longer a mature man.	Payqa manañam yuyayniyuq runachu.
It means they really know how to play the game.	Niyta munan paykunaqa chiqamanta yachanku pukllayta pukllayta.
No, he said, it wasn’t.	Manan, nispas nin, manan chay hinachu karqan.
You go for a bike ride.	Bicicletapi puriq rinki.
The first two weeks were tough.	Ñawpaq iskay semanan sinchi sasa karqan.
That, at least, he would agree.	Chayqa, aswanpas, payqa acuerdopi kanman.
Why, he had no idea.	Imarayku, mana ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
There is no nice word.	Manam sumaq rimayqa kanchu.
That would make sense.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
He did that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwarqa.
I thought about a lot of things.	Achkatam piensarqani.
If they weren’t ready for him.	Manachus paypaq listo karqanku chayqa.
Not sure why.	Mana segurochu imarayku kasqanmanta.
I haven't seen him in such a long time.	Chayna unayñam mana paytaqa rikunichu.
That something needs to be done.	Imapas ruwana kasqanmanta.
If it is true, it is not.	Chiqap kaptinqa, manam.
I did a lot this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi anchata ruwarqani.
The simpler the better.	Aswan facilmi aswan allin.
No, I loved him.	Manan, paytaqa anchatan munarqani.
There we are in the car.	Chaypim carropi kachkaniku.
He was fired today.	Kunan punchawmi qarqusqa karqa.
It was always you too.	Sapa kutim qampas karqanki.
A truly mysterious man.	Chiqap pakasqa runa.
Bigger and better things to come.	Aswan hatun aswan allin imakuna hamuq.
I always want more.	Sapa kutim aswan achkata munani.
I think you can do that.	Chayta ruwayta atisqaykita yuyaykuni.
He could have been there today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi chaypi kanman karqa.
Unfortunately they were all busy.	Llakikuypaqmi llapallanku ocupasqa karqaku.
But again, he's wrong about that.	Ichaqa yapamanta, chaymantaqa pantasqa kachkan.
You don’t know who they are.	Mana yachankichu pikuna kasqankuta.
I don’t know if you know that.	Mana yachanichu chayta yachankichu icha manachu.
It wasn’t always this way.	Manam sapa kutichu kayna karqa.
No one knew what was going on.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus pasashasqanmanta.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I am still excited about it.	Kunankamapas chaymantam kusisqa kachkani.
That makes no sense now.	Chayqa kunanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He was from another country and lived in another city.	Payqa huk llaqtamanta kaspa huk llaqtapi tiyaq.
He was alone, very lonely.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa, sinchi sapallanmi kasqa.
That makes me feel a little better.	Chaywanmi huk chhikanta allinta sientekuni.
It’s really good though.	Chiqamanta allinmi ichaqa.
He was a pretty bad guy.	Payqa allin millay runam karqa.
But he didn't think so.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
But it was clear he wouldn’t, he wouldn’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi karqan mana ruwananchu, manan ruwanqachu.
It never existed before.	Manam haykapipas ñawpaqtaqa karqachu.
He was unhappily married.	Payqa mana kusisqachu casarasqa karqan.
More disappointed.	Aswan hukmanyasqa.
Here are a few things to do.	Kaypi huk iskay kimsa ruwaykunata ruwanapaq kachkan.
He didn’t seem worried.	Payqa manan llakisqa hinachu kasqa.
The more, the easier.	Aswan achka kaptinqa, aswan facilmi.
Today was a good day.	Kunan punchawmi allin punchaw karqa.
Humanity sounds like what it sounds like.	Runa kayqa imayna uyarikun hinam uyarikun.
This did not happen immediately.	Kayqa manam chayllachu pasarqa.
But this was about three years ago.	Ichaqa yaqa kinsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi kayqa karqan.
It was two weeks.	Iskay semanan karqan.
I'm a bit surprised.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan admirasqa kachkani.
They were fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi karqaku.
It’s tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kachkan.
I saw it last night.	Qayna tuta rikurqani.
Probably very important.	Yaqapaschá ancha importante.
The first step is the best.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
I really care about you.	Chiqaptam qammanta llakikuni.
I really mean that.	Chaytaqa chiqaptam niyta munani.
Otherwise, it’s pretty bad.	Mana chayqa, ancha mana allinchu.
I do it too.	Ñuqapas ruwani.
I immediately know what it is.	Chayllam yachani ima kasqanmanta.
One, and together.	Huk, hinaspa kuska.
Today will be the best day.	Kunan punchawmi aswan allin punchaw kanqa.
Being a good person.	Allin ruwaq runa kay.
He says he doesn’t.	Payqa manan nispas nin.
He was very, very, drunk.	Payqa ancha, ancha, machasqa kasqa.
I don’t know if he can imagine such a thing.	Mana yachanichu chayna kaqta yuyaymanayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
Yeah, that’s what this is about.	Arí, chaymantam kayqa.
John, to leave.	Juan, ripunanpaq.
Making it better.	Aswan allinta ruwaspa.
You are a sad person.	Llakisqa runam kanki.
But then, you always did.	Ichaqa chaymanta, sapa kutim ruwarqanki.
You can’t talk about it.	Manam rimayta atiwaqchu.
Of course, they’re both good.	Chiqamanta, iskayninku allin kanku.
But I want to be real.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaytan munani.
No one can hear him.	Manan pipas paytaqa uyariyta atinmanchu.
They always want to do the hard way.	Sapa kutim sasa ñanta ruwayta munanku.
It was very high speed.	Ancha hatun utqayllam karqa.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munanchu.
But this should be the last resort.	Ichaqa kayqa qhepa kaq ruwaymi kanan.
So, forgive me.	Chaymi, pampachaykuway.
I never thought he was serious.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu serio kasqanmanta.
This is nice, but not very good.	Kayqa sumaqmi, ichaqa manam ancha allinchu.
Yes, do that.	Arí, chayta ruway.
This stuff is really good.	Kay imapas chiqap allinmi.
I still can't remember anything about it.	Kunankamapas manam chaymantaqa imatapas yuyariyta atinichu.
Here it is, now.	Kaypim kachkan, kunanqa.
Thank you, someone else.	Gracias, huk runa.
The big man was sad, really sad.	Chay hatun runaqa llakisqa kasqa, chiqap llakisqa.
He can’t do it there.	Mana chaypi ruwayta atinchu.
They are so beautiful.	Chayna sumaqmi kanku.
Then he started playing well.	Chaymantam allinta pukllayta qallaykurqa.
You know, it’s going to be nice.	Yachanki, sumaqmi kanqa.
You really don’t want to do that.	Chiqamanta mana chayta ruwayta munankichu.
There was nothing, no one.	Manam imapas karqachu, manam pipas karqachu.
He knows where everything is.	Payqa yachanmi maypi tukuy imapas kasqanmanta.
He is a great teacher.	Payqa hatun yachachiqmi.
They have the best ideas.	Paykunaqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
And this is the quickest way to do this work.	Hinaspa kaymi aswan utqaylla kay llamkayta ruwanapaq.
He was good enough for her.	Payqa allinmi karqan paypaq.
He is depressed now.	Payqa kunanmi llakisqa kachkan.
This isn’t a bad thing, it’s a good thing.	Kayqa manan mana allinchu, aswanpas allin ruwaymi.
Nobody wants to see that.	Chaytaqa manan pipas rikuyta munanchu.
He obviously doesn’t know anything about this.	Sut’inmi kaymanta mana imatapas yachanchu.
Being a follower.	Qatiqnin kay.
He was not alone at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
Maybe a few months.	Ichapas iskay kimsa killa kanman.
I couldn't do this now.	Kunanqa manam kayta ruwayta atirqanichu.
Tonight at home.	Kay tuta wasipi.
It was surprisingly not very successful.	Admirakuypaqmi mana ancha allinchu karqa.
I pretty much knew it was going to be bad.	Yaqapaschá yacharqani mana allin kananta.
Doesn’t it do that.	Chaytachu ruwan.
Twice, maybe three times.	Iskay kutita, ichapas kimsa kutita.
This really seems pretty easy.	Kayqa chiqaptam ancha facil hina rikchakun.
I couldn’t walk anymore.	Manañam puriyta atirqanichu.
It was difficult, very difficult.	Sasa karqa, ancha sasa.
Something wanted to look good.	Imapas allin rikchayniyuq kayta munarqa.
I really like it.	Chiqaptam gustan.
Anyway, there was a man with three names.	Imayna kaptinpas, kimsa sutiyuq runam karqa.
Out in the world.	Kay pachapi hawapi.
He seemed hungry.	Payqa yarqasqa hinam karqa.
He knew what he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi yachasqanmanta.
Like coffee or something.	Kukata utaq imapaqpas hina.
It was a process.	Huk ruwaymi karqan.
Now I was sure of it.	Kunanqa segurom karqani chaymanta.
Two people were with us.	Iskay runakunam ñuqaykuwan kuska karqaku.
Who is younger than him.	Pitaq paymanta sullk'a.
He had been gone too long.	Payqa llumpay unayñam rirqa.
He was probably there the whole time.	Payqa yaqapaschá tukuy tiempo chaypi kasqa.
Maybe more tired, that’s all.	Ichapas aswan sayk’usqa, chaylla.
That’s tomorrow.	Chayqa paqarinmi.
I am really glad to be here.	Chiqaptam kusikuni kaypi kasqaymanta.
Ten tens of thousands.	Chunka chunka.
That’s what I thought.	Chaytan yuyaykurqani.
He told me exactly what he wanted me to do.	Payqa allintam niwarqa ima ruwanay munasqanmanta.
Almost every day, in fact.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
It looks very good.	Ancha allinmi rikchakun.
Not an easy truth.	Mana facil chiqap kaptinqa.
But right now.	Ichaqa kunanpacha.
This happened almost every night.	Yaqa sapa tutam kayna karqa.
But why would you do that?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaraykutaq chayta ruwawaq?.
I didn’t know where to go.	Manam yacharqanichu mayman rinaypaq.
If you agree.	Sichus acuerdopi kanki chayqa.
You’re good at it.	Allinmi kanki chaypi.
He wanted to get out of here.	Payqa kaymanta lluqsiyta munarqa.
All except him.	Llapallankum paymanta mana.
So it worked out kind of well.	Chaymi huk laya allinta lluqsirqa.
Probably not, you know.	Manapaschá, yachanki.
I first saw him here.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim paytaqa rikurqani.
Not even, either.	Manam nitaq, nitaq.
About three years.	Yaqa kimsa wata.
But that wasn’t all he could do.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu ruwayta atinman karqan.
It makes the game more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi pukllayta ruwan.
I hope this will be great.	Suyachkani kay hatun kananta.
It seemed like it would be easy.	Chayqa facilmi kanman hinam karqa.
I was alone in myself.	Sapallanmi karqani.
He couldn’t be better.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu kanman.
I don’t know what’s wrong with the process.	Mana yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta chay ruwaypi.
That certainly seemed to be the case now.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kunanqa kanman hina karqan.
He really wanted to.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munarqan.
Can't remember which.	Mana yuyariyta atinchu mayqin.
Is it right for you?.	¿Allinchu qampaq?.
I have no reason to do it three times.	Manam imaraykupas kimsa kutita ruwanaypaqqa kanchu.
The bad thing here, though, is pretty bad.	Kaypi mana allinqa ichaqa ancha mana allinmi.
I want to sing more.	Astawan takiyta munani.
One of them, anyway.	Hukninmi, imayna kaptinpas.
He didn’t want to be with her.	Payqa manan paywan kayta munarqanchu.
It will be very soon.	Ancha utqayllam kanqa.
I knew this fact all too well.	Kay chiqaptaqa allintam yacharqani.
So, that’s really good.	Chaymi, chayqa chiqap allinmi.
He doesn’t care why.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imarayku chaytaqa.
This is all that, and something else.	Kaymi tukuy chay, huk imapas.
It is a very quick and easy process.	Chayqa ancha utqaylla hinaspa facil ruwaymi.
I will continue to be here.	Kaypiqa hinallam kasaq.
I’ve been around for a long time.	Ñuqaqa unayñam kachkani.
Something important had just happened.	Chayraqmi imapas importante kaq pasarqa.
The man was nobody.	Chay runaqa manam pipas karqachu.
Who are you.	Pitaq kanki.
That’s what I did.	Chayta ruwarqani.
I ask myself that question.	Chaynatam tapukuni.
They’re serious.	Paykunaqa serio kanku.
I want someone to come home to me.	Munani pipas wasiyman kutimunanta.
Today is not a good day.	Kunan punchawqa manam allin punchawchu.
I thought the world would be outraged.	Kay pacha runakuna phiñasqa kananta yuyaykurqani.
So it’s the best.	Chaymi aswan allin.
If it’s good, it would be good.	Allin kaptinqa allinmi kanman.
I wanted to play it again.	Chaytaqa hukmanta tocayta munarqani.
Black, black, black.	Yana, yana, yana.
They are beautiful people.	Paykunaqa sumaq runam kanku.
It goes fast, folks.	Utqaylla rin, runakuna.
While this is certainly useful, it can be very difficult.	Kayqa chiqamanta allin kaptinpas, ancha sasa kanman.
He did it again, same.	Yapamanta ruwarqa, kikin.
Do you know yours?.	¿Qanpa kaqta yachankichu?.
He sounds pathetic.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi uyarikun.
Uncertainty is the new reality.	Mana seguro kaymi mosoq cheqaq kaq.
I mean, seriously .	Niyta munani, serio .
I’m not ready to go now.	Kunanqa manan listochu kashani rinaypaq.
The youngest was ten.	Sullk'a kaqmi chunka karqan.
But, something though.	Ichaqa, imapas ichaqa.
Great things all.	Hatun imakuna tukuy.
And so we did the deed.	Hinaspa chaymi chay ruwayta ruwarqayku.
And this time he means it.	Hinaspa kay kutipi chayta niyta munan.
He didn’t want to hear the truth.	Payqa manan cheqaq kaqta uyariyta munarqanchu.
He is a fool.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
They want to be.	Paykunaqa kayta munanku.
It means not worried.	Mana llakisqa niyta munan.
It would be easy to be here all day.	Facilmi kanman tukuy punchaw kaypi kayqa.
Of course, you should.	Chiqamanta, qamqa ruwanayki tiyan.
You seemed disappointed.	Hukmanyasqa hinam karqanki.
Why does he want to sleep in his own house.	Imaraykutaq kikin wasinpi puñuyta munan.
He seemed quite surprised by it.	Payqa chaywanqa ancha admirasqa hinam karqa.
So this is a problem.	Chaymi kayqa sasachakuy.
He didn’t have to do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwananchu karqan.
The last one did it for me.	Qhipa kaqmi ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
But that's all for now.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa chayllam.
We didn’t have to do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwanayku karqa.
Why, we have no idea.	Imarayku, mana yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
That’s next year.	Chayqa hamuq wata.
The phrase is as hard as food.	Chay rimayqa mikhuy hina sinchi sasa.
These can be difficult to do.	Chaykunataqa sasa ruwaymi kanman.
They are human-like.	Paykunaqa runa hinam kanku.
And then it was bigger the third year.	Hinaspa chaymanta aswan hatun karqan kinsa kaq wata.
That’s why he does it.	Chayraykum chayta ruwan.
He never thought he would.	Mana hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwananta.
There is a first.	Ñawpaq kaqmi kan.
This is a wonderful thing to do.	Kayqa sumaq ruwaymi.
I don’t know how to do that.	Manam yachanichu chayta ruwaytaqa.
But he refused this time.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu kay kutipi.
But he can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.
But three years later, there was a problem.	Ichaqa kinsa wata qhepamanmi sasachakuy karqan.
It says it all really.	Tukuy chayta nin chiqaptapuni.
Many people know that.	Achka runakunam chayta yachanku.
He seems to be a confused man.	Payqa pantasqa runa hinam.
That is always very difficult.	Chayqa sapa kutim ancha sasa.
Still able to drive daily.	Hinallam sapa punchaw carrota manejayta atin.
So then it’s.	Chaymi chaymanta.
I'm fine thank you.	Allinmi kachkani gracias.
Even if it is a human being.	Runa kaptinpas.
No one is ever happy doing that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas kusisqachu chayta ruwaspaqa.
He will probably go.	Yaqapaschá payqa rinqa.
Neither better nor worse.	Ni aswan allinchu nitaq aswan mana allinchu.
He certainly has a lot of wealth in his house.	Cheqaqtapunin askha qhapaq kay wasinpi kashan.
He did nothing for twenty years.	Iskay chunka wata mana imatapas ruwarqanchu.
It was very human-like.	Ancha runa hinam karqa.
Here’s how we did it.	Kaypi imaynatachus ruwarqayku.
It wasn't the worst.	Manam aswan mana allinchu karqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
Eventually, he got what he wanted.	Qhepamanmi munasqanta chaskirqan.
I thought you would.	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim qamqa.
I am truly concerned about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymanta llakikuni.
I couldn’t understand that.	Chaytaqa manan entiendeyta atirqanichu.
He thought of doing other things.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi huk ruwaykunata ruwananpaq.
That’s right, three.	Chayqa allinmi, kimsa.
He said that to me once.	Chaynatam huk kutipi niwarqa.
I never knew this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa yacharqanichu.
I would agree with that.	Ñoqapas chaytan acuerdopi kasaq.
That's really funny.	Chayqa chiqap asikunapaq hinam.
I was so foolish.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
He obviously can.	Payqa sut’inmi atin.
But that doesn't work.	Ichaqa chaymi mana allintachu ruwan.
A good first step.	Allin ñawpaq kaq ruway.
But it doesn’t always mean that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chayta niyta munan.
Otherwise you'll never know.	Mana chayqa manan hayk'aqpas yachankichu.
I think he knows what he’s going to do.	Yuyaykuni ima ruwananta yachan.
He eats it at night.	Chaytaqa tutan mikun.
But he didn’t say anything about what I did.	Ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu ruwasqaymanta.
But he always knew what he wanted.	Ichaqa tukuy tiempon yacharqan ima munasqanta.
That means that the .	Chayqa niyta munan, chay .
Of course not, they’re human.	Chiqamanta mana, paykunaqa runa kanku.
If the process is right for you.	Sichus chay ruway qanpaq allin kanman chayqa.
He was drunk.	Paymi machasqa kasqa.
But now he was alone.	Ichaqa kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
They are great though in one way.	Paykunaqa ancha allinmi ichaqa huk ruwaypi.
The first person, on the other hand, is frustrated all the time.	Ñawpaq kaq runan ichaqa tukuy tiempopi hukmanyasqa kashan.
He was angry and drunk.	Payqa phiñasqa, machasqa ima kasqa.
I thought that was more time.	Chayqa aswan tiempo kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Surely someone wanted to be first.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaqtaqa pipas kayta munarqan.
So, now it’s not.	Chaymi, kunanqa manaña.
But you don’t really know that.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaytaqa yachanki.
It will be the same as before.	Ñawpaqpi hinam kanqa.
Do whatever you want with it.	Chaywan ima munasqaykita ruway.
I never want to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu.
Something bigger than he expected went wrong.	Suyasqanmanta aswan hatun imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I mean, a sure thing.	Niyta munani, huk seguro kaq.
Maybe you do a good but not great job.	Ichapas huk allin ichaqa mana hatun llamkayta ruwanki.
They want to be happy.	Paykunaqa munanku kusisqa kayta.
He couldn’t remember.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu.
All night long.	Tukuy tuta.
After that, however	Chay qhepamanmi ichaqa .
It sounds so easy.	Ancha facilmi uyarikun.
I hope no one ever does.	Suyachkani mana pipas haykapipas chayta ruwananpaq.
It was such a big deal.	Chayna hatun ruwaymi karqa.
So he may not be there for long.	Chaymi manapaschá chaypiqa unaytachu kanman.
In fact, there is nothing.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas kanchu.
Everything began to speed up.	Tukuy imapas utqaylla puriyta qallaykurqa.
And a lot of times, it's very difficult.	Hinaspa achka kutipi, ancha sasa.
He was very sad that it wasn't.	Payqa anchatam llakisqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He was that quick.	Payqa chayna utqayllam karqa.
You are not the person you used to be.	Qamqa manam ñawpaqpi kaq runachu kanki.
It’s the first one.	Ñawpaq kaqmi.
That was not to be, however.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan ichaqa.
Why are you gone.	Imaraykutaq manaña kanki.
That was really, really nice.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
I want to catch him.	Payta hapiyta munani.
He knows he’ll do it in the morning.	Payqa yachanmi tutamanta ruwananta.
Certainly, this time.	Chiqamanta, kay kutipi.
Maybe he was there.	Ichapas payqa chaypi karqa.
So you did that.	Chaymi chayta ruwarqanki.
About ten hours.	Yaqa chunka pacha.
I just couldn't stop him.	Chayllam mana harkayta atirqanichu.
And if it is a child .	Hinaspa huk wawa kaptinqa .
He’s nice to me.	Payqa sumaqmi ñuqawan.
It will be a wonderful night.	Ancha sumaq tutam kanqa.
I’ve never seen them before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaykunataqa rikurqanichu.
He was not in a position to do anything else.	Payqa manan huk ruwaykunata ruwananpaq hinachu kasharqan.
But, but .	Ichaqa, ichaqa .
either.	utaq.
But if it is good.	Ichaqa allin kaptinqa.
But they were very hungry.	Ichaqa sinchi yarqasqa karqanku.
Tell me more about that.	Chaymanta astawan willaway.
He didn't know why now.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku kunanqa.
It seems a very long time ago.	Ancha unayñam rikchakun.
I'll be here.	Kaypi kasaq.
Both of them this time.	Iskayninku kay kutipi.
Nothing can be too serious.	Mana imapas ancha serio kayta atinchu.
However, it goes beyond that in practice.	Ichaqa, chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi rin ruwaypi.
Perhaps he did not want to understand.	Yaqapaschá payqa mana entiendeyta munarqanchu.
After all, there is so much going on.	Tukuy imamanta, ancha hatun ruwaymi kachkan.
No, that’s the other one.	Manan, chay huknin.
I just didn’t notice.	Chaylla mana repararqanichu.
I don't care about that anymore.	Manañam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
I’m not the best.	Manam aswan allinchu kani.
He’s the one who does it.	Paymi chayta ruwan.
It wasn’t there yet.	Manaraqmi karqachu.
A lot of talking is one thing.	Achka rimayqa huk ruwaymi.
It was actually pretty amazing.	Chiqaptaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know how to tell it.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna willayta.
Sure enough, that’s it.	Seguro, chaymi.
That way it wasn’t supposed to be.	Chay hinaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
Tell me if it’s good or not.	Willaway allinchu icha manachu chayta.
A few years later it happened.	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi chay hina karqan.
There is nothing but you.	Manan imapas kanchu aswanpas qanmi.
He looked at the book.	Chay librota qhawarisqa.
He didn’t want to be there.	Payqa manan chaypi kayta munarqanchu.
I know he won't.	Yachanim mana ruwananta.
He wasn’t sure about her anymore.	Paymanta manaña segurochu karqan.
That was absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
It came out two weeks ago.	Iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi lluqsirqa.
At this point it’s up to you what you do with it.	Kaypiqa qammanta kanqa imatachus chaywan ruwanki chayta.
You wouldn’t want it for anyone.	Manam pimanpas munawaqchu.
But it’s worth it for that.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa allinmi.
It means don’t do that.	Chaytaqa ama ruwaychu niyta munan.
No one knows what to make of him.	Manan pipas yachanchu paymanta ima ruwananta.
And he's happy, now.	Hinaspa kusisqa kachkan, kunanqa.
Someone knows it exists.	Pipas yachanmi kasqanmanta.
Now it makes no sense.	Kunanqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
He wasn't sure he did.	Payqa manan segurochu karqan chay ruwasqanmanta.
Every year less.	Sapa wata pisi.
There he was quite happy.	Chaypin payqa allinta kusisqa kasharqan.
I don't know where he is now.	Manam yachanichu kunan maypi kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta atirqanichu.
You can’t tell him.	Manan paytaqa willayta atiwaqchu.
I don’t understand either.	Ñuqapas manam entiendenichu.
It was always about me.	Sapa kutim ñuqamanta karqa.
That is a very bad thing to do.	Chayqa sinchi mana allin ruwaymi.
Now everything is clear.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas sut'inmi.
That should be pretty obvious.	Chayqa allin sut’inmi kanan.
And he did that very well.	Hinaspa chayta ruwarqan ancha allinta.
I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.	Unayñan kayta yuyaykushani.
He looks familiar, like ever.	Payqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakun, ñawpaq hina.
Like, thirty or something.	Imayna, kimsa chunka utaq imapas.
Probably not, but maybe.	Manapaschá, ichaqa ichapas.
And that’s what you do.	Hinaspa chayta ruwanki.
That’s a man.	Chayqa runa.
You did as he said or else.	Nisqanman hinam ruwarqanki mana chayqa.
It’s never been this hard before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hina sasachu karqan.
Something but nothing.	Imapas ichaqa mana imapas.
You want to get out there.	Chayman lluqsiyta munanki.
But he knew where he was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
We cannot give up now.	Kunanqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
Too many unknowns.	Ancha achka mana riqsisqa.
A truly intelligent man.	Chiqap yachaysapa runa.
Soon he will be something better.	Pisi tiempollamantan payqa imapas aswan allin kanqa.
Eat it, if you want.	Mikhuy, munaspaqa.
This was going to be nice.	Kayqa sumaqmi kachkarqa.
He’s not doing enough.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwashan.
And then there were three.	Hinaspa chaymanta kimsa kasqa.
How about you?.	¿Imaynataq qam?.
But something else happened.	Ichaqa huk imapas pasarqa.
I think he is a great guy.	Payqa hatun runa kasqanmantam piensani.
Why did it look familiar.	¿Imanasqataq riqsisqa rikchakurqa.
Something .	Imapas .
Of course, it’s not always that simple.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu chay hina facilchu.
It had to be bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kanan karqan.
I don't care what he's going to do.	Manam imananpaschu imakuna ruwananmanta.
They were immediate.	Paykunaqa chayllam karqaku.
Maybe that’s what they want.	Ichapas chayta munanku.
He must be an adult.	Payqa kuraq runam kanan.
He doesn’t do well.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwan.
Unfortunately, we didn't do so well.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam chayna allintachu ruwarqayku.
Who isn’t there.	Pitaq mana chaypichu.
That must have been a difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa yaqapaschá ancha sasa karqa.
It was a really great time.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq pacha karqa.
This went well enough.	Kayqa allintam pasarqa.
I know people are busy.	Yachanim runakuna ocupasqa kasqankuta.
Yes, he is a beautiful man.	Arí, payqa sumaq runam.
Of course of course not.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta mana.
I couldn’t leave it at that.	Manam chaynataqa saqiyta atirqanichu.
It will be something icy.	Chayqa kanqa imapas chiri chiri hinam.
It’s not bad or bad.	Manan mana allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
I can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atinichu.
There is no nice and easy way to do it.	Manam kanchu sumaq hinaspa facil ruway ruwanapaq.
What ever it should do.	Ima hayk’aqpas chayta ruwanan.
He doesn’t really know how to go from here.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yachan imaynatachus kaymanta riyta.
But worried about you.	Ichaqa qanmanta llakisqa.
That would have been stupid.	Chayqa sonso kaymi kanman karqan.
It is now available here.	Kunanqa kaypi tarikun.
It’s hidden.	Pakasqa kachkan.
An hour or two, at least.	Huk iskay hora, aswanpas.
But it had to be clear.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kanan karqan.
He will probably do something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas ruwanqa.
I just heard it again.	Chayllaraqmi hukmanta uyarirqani.
Deportation could follow.	Chay qhepamanmi kanman huk nacionmanta qarqosqa kay.
He looked up now.	Payqa kunanqa qhawarisqa.
Then another, then another.	Chaymanta huk, chaymanta huk.
It’s just so beautiful.	Chaylla ancha sumaqmi.
No, it shouldn’t be.	Manan, manan chay hinachu kanan.
You want to see it more than once.	Aswan huk kutitam qawayta munanki.
But, he didn’t need to.	Ichaqa, manan necesitarqanchu.
What’s more, you knew.	Imataq aswan, yacharqanki.
It was there the whole time.	Chaypin tukuy tiempo karqan.
Rather like clothes.	Aswanpas pacha hina.
I am not sure if that is correct.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chay allin kasqanmanta.
He seemed really happy.	Payqa chiqap kusisqa hinam karqa.
He will never, ever, be that person.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas, chay runaqa kanqachu.
But is that really true?.	Ichaqa, ¿cheqaqchu chay?.
That was everything, really.	Chayqa tukuy imapas karqa, chiqaptaqa.
Now, how he feels.	Kunanqa, imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Why, he could do this every day.	Imarayku, sapa p’unchaw kayta ruwayta atinman karqa.
He doesn’t, you know.	Payqa manan, yachanki.
It didn’t seem to be much good anymore.	Manaña ancha allinchu kanman hina karqan.
He would love for that to happen.	Payqa anchatan munanman chay pasananta.
Rude! 	Millay!
The best thing to do is to do it regularly.	Aswan allinqa sapa kuti ruwaymi.
For almost anything.	Yaqa imapaqpas.
I mean, sort of.	Niyta munani, huk laya.
I want to live in that house.	Chay wasipi tiyayta munani.
I don’t want to eat.	Manam mikuyta munanichu.
I probably know.	Yaqapaschá yachani.
To do nothing is to do nothing.	Mana imatapas ruwaspaqa mana imatapas ruwaymi.
Instead, it will be very useful.	Aswanpas ancha allinmi kanqa.
And he wanted to get home.	Hinaspa wasinman chayayta munarqa.
He really didn’t know how to do it.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa manas yacharqanchu imayna ruwananta.
So maybe it was for the best.	Chaymi ichapas allinpaq karqa.
He thought he would speak again.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi hukmanta rimananpaq.
I hope next week will be better.	Hamuq semana aswan allin kananta suyachkani.
That should be wonderful.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanan.
So that’s what he meant.	Chaymi chayta niyta munarqa.
It could be worse though.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman ichaqa.
He's really sick.	Payqa chiqaptam unqusqa kachkan.
There are a lot of people here.	Kaypiqa achka runakunam kachkan.
I'll have to be more mindful of that.	Chaymantaqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi kanay kanqa.
But he knew exactly what it would be like.	Ichaqa allintan yacharqan imayna kananta.
I’m going to be a bad guy.	Ñuqaqa millay runam kasaq.
And all that sort of thing.	Hinaspa llapan chay hina.
It was really crazy.	Chiqaptam loco karqa.
Don’t be too passive.	Ama sinchita mana imatapas ruwaychu.
You know you're overtired sometimes.	Yachanki wakin kutipi llumpay sayk'usqa kasqaykita.
This evil good guy.	Kay millay allin ruwaq.
He looked again, quickly.	Hukmanta qhawarisqa, usqhaylla.
So, however, it goes.	Chaymi ichaqa rin.
You know it's a good thing.	Qamqa allintam yachanki.
He knows he has something coming for him.	Payqa yachanmi imapas paypaq hamunanta.
I have never, ever seen it.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas rikurqanichu.
I thought that was wrong.	Ñuqaqa chaytam mana allintachu piensarqani.
You are really worried.	Qamqa chiqaptam llakisqa kachkanki.
I don’t want to remember them.	Manam chaykunataqa yuyariyta munanichu.
That was the easiest thing to do.	Chayqa karqan aswan facil ruwaymi.
Perhaps it came voluntarily.	Yaqapaschá munasqanman hina hamurqan.
I’m fine with that if you are.	Allinmi kani chaywan sichus kanki chayqa.
And then, here’s one for you.	Hinaspa chaymanta, kaypi huk qampaq.
There is a process.	Chay ruwayqa kanmi.
I don't agree with that.	Chaytaqa manam acuerdopichu kani.
That was a big maybe.	Chayqa hatun ichapas karqa.
But it was good, doing so.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan, hina ruwaspa.
Yes, a wise man.	Arí, yachaysapa runa.
Now he knows what it is.	Kunanmi ichaqa yachan ima kasqanta.
I want to do more, I want to learn more.	Astawan ruwayta munani, astawan yachayta munani.
I wanted to see this all the way through.	Kayta tukuy ñanta rikuyta munarqani.
He said he wanted the truth.	Payqa nirqam chiqap kaqta munasqanmanta.
I can't sleep now.	Kunanqa manam puñuyta atinichu.
He was a bad person to me.	Payqa mana allin runam karqa ñuqapaq.
And one morning.	Hinaspa huk paqarin.
Maybe there’s something for you.	Ichapas qampaq imapas kanman.
One of them still exists.	Hukninmi kunankamapas kachkan.
Everything was miserable.	Tukuy imapas llakikuypaqmi karqa.
That would be a good and effective thing to do.	Chayqa allin hinaspa allin ruwaymi kanman.
I’ve seen it all before.	Ñawpaqta tukuy chayta rikurqani.
Maybe he wanted to help.	Ichapas yanapayta munarqa.
Maybe it’s something similar.	Ichapas chayna kaq imapas kanman.
He thought about it every day.	Chaypin sapa p’unchay yuyaykurqan.
There was actually a third person involved.	Chiqamanta kimsa kaq runa chaypi kachkarqa.
I want to go home.	Wasiman riyta munani.
He was with me with me, all the time.	Payqa ñoqawanmi karqan ñoqawan kuska, tukuy tiempopi.
He seemed very rich.	Payqa ancha qhapaq hinam karqa.
There's a guy.	Chaypi kaq.
I want to let it be like this.	Kayna kananpaqmi saqiyta munani.
I don’t want to see any more.	Manam astawan qawayta munanichu.
There really is no room for confusion here.	Chiqaptaqa manam kaypiqa kanchu pantasqa kananpaq.
Never anything too bad.	Ama hayk’aqpas imapas ancha mana allinqa.
Obviously, it’s not.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu.
He said that he did.	Payqa nirqam chayna ruwasqanmanta.
He knew her name yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi sutinta riqsisqa.
He started working.	Payqa llamkayta qallaykurqa.
He is not well now.	Payqa kunanqa manam allinchu.
I was extremely tired and hungry.	Sinchi sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima karqani.
But you can’t drive yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi carrota manejayta atiwaqchu.
I can’t just leave.	Manam chayllachu ripuyta atiyman.
I’m that quick.	Chayna utqayllam kani.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Paymi niwarqa ima ruway munasqanmanta.
He wants to tell her that he is not afraid.	Mana manchakusqanmanta willayta munan.
Do it, do it now!.	Ruway, kunan ruway!.
I didn’t think anything of it, you know.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yuyaykurqanichu, yachanki.
He didn’t need the money.	Payqa manan chay qolqeta necesitarqanchu.
I can walk around.	Puriyta atiyman.
What happened next, he had no idea.	Chay qhepaman imachus kananta, manan yuyaykurqanchu.
He must be foolish.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
A lot, all the time.	Achka, tukuy pacha.
It certainly would do.	Chiqamanta ruwanman.
I’m glad I was there.	Kusikuni chaypi kasqaymanta.
He knows when it is best.	Payqa yachanmi haykapi aswan allin kasqanmanta.
Surely everything would be fine now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa tukuy imapas allin kanman.
And they’re angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kashanku.
This guy did it.	Kay runaqa ruwarqa.
I mean, the second one.	Niyta munani, iskay kaq.
I’m just angry.	Chayllam phiñasqa kachkani.
I'm really trying here.	Chiqaptam kaypi kallpanchakuchkani.
He never needed a car.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas carrota necesitarqanchu.
Like, great great.	Imayna, hatun hatun.
Something you might want to check out.	Imapas ichapas qawayta munanki.
That would have been the.	Chayqa kanman karqan chay.
I wanted to go to school.	Yachay wasiman riyta munarqani.
Either he goes or you go.	Icha pay rin icha qam rinki.
He passed away.	Payqa pasarqa.
I know how lonely you are.	Yachanim imayna sapallayki kasqaykita.
I can’t do this.	Manam kaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
It’s not really very good.	Manam chiqaptachu ancha allin.
You are the one who wants the money.	Qanmi kanki chay qullqita munanki.
I just never heard of it.	Chayllaraqmi mana haykapipas uyarirqanichu.
Now it’s a lot bigger.	Kunanqa aswan hatunmi.
I was a teacher.	Ñuqa yachachiqmi karqani.
Like all the wrong things.	Tukuy mana allin hina.
If then .	Sichus chaymanta.
All morning at home.	Tukuy tutamanta wasipi.
Which is up to you.	Imataq qammanta kanqa.
He made this movie.	Paymi kay peliculata ruwarqan.
Maybe you want to do something bigger.	Ichapas aswan hatun ruwayta munanki.
Tell me what you want to talk about.	Willaway imamanta rimayta munanki.
The first ten years ago.	Ñawpaq kaq chunka wata ñawpaqta.
I think he knew.	Yuyaykuni payqa yacharqanmi.
Obviously that’s not going to work.	Sut’inmi chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
Now he had no choice.	Kunanqa manañan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
That was today.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi karqa.
But ultimately he failed.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi mana atirqanchu.
And, he didn’t do that.	Hinaspa, manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He could have been better.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
They weren’t really like that.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna karqanku.
So that had to be the case in the first place.	Chaymi ñawpaqtaqa chayna kanan karqa.
That was just that.	Chayqa chayraqmi karqan.
No one ever knew it was me.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu ñoqa kasqayta.
Repeat the process one or more times.	Huk kutita utaq achka kutita chay ruwayta yapamanta ruway.
I wish it wasn't.	Munaymanmi mana chayna kaptinpas.
Can't work maybe.	Mana llamk'ayta atinchu ichapas.
I know that’s a good thing.	Chaytaqa allintan yachani.
If he can’t, it’s too bad.	Mana atinchu chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
He couldn't do anything right.	Payqa manam imatapas allinta ruwayta atirqachu.
He’s a house boy.	Payqa wasi wayna.
But I’m happy in the car.	Ichaqa kusisqa kashani chay carropi.
Not here or anywhere else.	Mana kaypichu nitaq maypipas.
This never happened before.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
It’s part of being human.	Runa kaymanta hukninmi.
It can’t be done.	Manam atinmanchu.
It is best to act innocently.	Aswan allinqa mana huchayoq ruwaymi.
For about ten years.	Yaqa chunka wata.
He was drunk and depressed.	Payqa machasqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
Like, very much.	Imayna, ancha.
This was probably a very good thing.	Kayqa yaqapaschá ancha allin karqa.
He knew who they were.	Payqa yacharqanmi pikuna kasqankuta.
That was insane.	Chayqa loco kaymi karqan.
Or at least sometimes.	Utaq aswan pisi wakin kuti.
I had to do that.	Ñuqaqa chaytam ruwanay karqa.
He said he was constantly sick and depressed.	Paymi nirqa sapa kuti unqusqa hinaspa llakisqa kasqanmanta.
That’s your thing.	Chayqa qampa kaqmi.
He told the story well.	Payqa allintan willarqan.
He thinks he's ready.	Payqa piensanmi listoña kashasqanmanta.
After all, someone has to do it.	Tukuy imamanta, pipas ruwanan tiyan.
Good learning!.	¡Allin yachay!.
He didn’t know what his real name was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima cheqaq sutin kasqanmanta.
He prefers to stay at home.	Payqa aswan allinmi wasinpi qhepakuyta.
This statement makes no sense.	Kay nisqanqa manan imapaqpas allinchu.
But, it looks good.	Ichaqa, allinmi rikchakun.
This was going to be the last chance.	Kayqa qhipa kaq chansa kanan karqa.
Much smarter now.	Aswan yachaysapa kunan.
I’m holding it.	Ñuqaqa hapini.
That’s kind of what goes.	Chayqa huk laya imapas rin.
It’s a good day.	Allin punchawmi.
He knew what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqantapas.
One didn’t do it right away.	Hukninmi mana chayllachu ruwarqa.
But that’s what some guy did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan wakin wayna.
I hope he doesn't get hurt.	Suyachkani mana k'irisqa kananpaq.
But that was crazy.	Ichaqa chayqa loco hinan karqan.
That would be very mysterious.	Chayqa ancha pakasqa kanman.
You do it all the time.	Qamqa sapa kutim ruwanki.
I sure hope he does.	Seguro suyachkani chayta ruwananpaq.
That’s probably the single biggest thing.	Chayqa ichapas sapallan aswan hatun kaq.
For something else.	Huk imapaqpas.
That’s a good player.	Chayqa allin pukllaqmi.
Despite a famous celebrity, it wasn't easy.	Huk riqsisqa riqsisqa kaptinpas, manam facilchu karqa.
I hardly remember him.	Manapaschá paytaqa yuyarinichu.
I think you want that.	Chayta munasqaykita yuyani.
It’s not easy, in this city.	Manam facilchu, kay llaqtapi.
Better to be sure.	Aswan allinmi seguro kay.
Tell me again how it happened.	Hukmanta willaway imayna pasasqanmanta.
Always there, always ready.	Sapa kutim chaypi karqa, sapa kutim listo karqa.
I never did that again.	Manañam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwarqanichu.
They have always existed.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqaku.
It’s always something.	Sapa kutim imapas.
There is a process.	Huk ruwaymi kachkan.
But everything would be fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
And he's alone.	Hinaspa payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
I didn't see much of that.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu rikurqani.
Do better next time.	Qatiqnin kutipi aswan allinta ruway.
He's too quick for you.	Payqa ancha utqayllam qampaq.
It’s all beautiful.	Tukuy sumaqmi.
They seem to agree.	Paykunaqa acuerdopi hinam kachkanku.
It can do three things.	Kimsa ruwaykunata ruwanman.
Everything felt so fresh and new.	Tukuy imapas ancha musuq hinaspa musuq hinam karqa.
Most people are like that.	Yaqa llapan runakunam chayna kanku.
He wanted to go big or go home.	Payqa hatun riyta utaq wasinman riyta munarqa.
I want to fix something.	Imatapas allichayta munani.
But it wasn’t easy to do.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan chayta ruwayqa.
I thought everything was that fast.	Yuyarqanim tukuy imapas chay utqaylla kasqanmanta.
Say no to things.	Imakunatapas mana niy.
Yes, it certainly does.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
I wish you were here with us.	Munaymanmi kaypi ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita.
Plus, it’s a tough time here now.	Astawan, kunan kaypi huk sinchi pacha.
I just thought about what kind of person he was.	Chayllaraqmi yuyaykurqani imayna runa hina kasqanmanta.
Maybe he can do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman.
Maybe all over the house.	Ichapas tukuy wasipi.
He may never do that.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
But that was a good decade ago.	Ichaqa chayqa allin chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I mean now, you know, today.	Niyta munani kunan, yachanki, kunan punchaw.
Another patient, perhaps.	Huknin unqusqa, ichapas.
Action, however, is the most important thing.	Ruwaymi ichaqa aswan allinqa.
There is nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas kanchu.
You know how bad it is.	Yachankim chayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
People are so funny.	Runakunaqa ancha asikunapaq hinam kanku.
He doesn't want to figure this out.	Payqa manam kayta yuyaymanayta munanchu.
No, not at all.	Manan, manan imapipas.
Maybe you want to go there.	Ichapas chayman riyta munanki.
No, it’s not.	Manan manan.
All morning, all afternoon.	Tukuy paqarin, tukuy tarde.
I wanted to win so hard.	Ancha sinchitan atipayta munarqani.
I was so happy and so proud.	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa ancha orgulloso karqani.
You can't hear it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam uyariyta atiwaqchu.
This would have been the case.	Kaymi kanman karqan.
Don’t forget to eat.	Ama mikhuyta qunqaychu.
He knew everything about me.	Payqa tukuy imatam yacharqa ñuqamanta.
And now I don’t know what to say.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña yachanichu ima niyta.
He can't do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
They love to do it, actually.	Paykunaqa anchatam munanku chayta ruwayta, chiqaptaqa.
But it is not difficult to do.	Ichaqa manan sasa ruwaychu.
Probably all year round.	Yaqapaschá tukuy wata.
This could be you.	Kaytaqa qanmi kanman.
Not sure where and when.	Mana segurochu maypi haykapi.
I have said this many times.	Achka kutitam kayta nirqani.
They are all here.	Llapallankum kaypi kachkanku.
But it was very bad.	Ichaqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
That was actually great.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s not going to be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanqa.
Maybe no one does.	Ichapas mana pipas ruwanchu.
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqan.
Do this.	Ruway kay.
Actually, at least.	Chiqaptaqa, aswanpas.
But he came a few times.	Ichaqa iskay kinsa kutitan hamurqan.
Hidden like a child.	Wawa hina pakasqa.
Yes this will happen, as far as it can.	Arí kayqa kanqa, atisqanman hina.
Not a huge difference.	Mana hatun chikan kaychu.
He wanted to do something wrong.	Imapas mana allinta ruwayta munarqa.
He always walked first.	Payqa sapa kutim puntata puriq.
He was, however, recently appointed.	Payqa ichaqa chayllaraqmi churasqa karqa.
And a week.	Hinaspa huk semana.
Be like him.	Pay hina kay.
I wish he didn't mean anything to me.	Munaymanmi pay mana ñuqapaq imapaqpas kananta.
But he won’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
I never really thought it was too cold.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa piensarqanichu llumpay chiri kasqanmantaqa.
Everyone is sitting there.	Chaypin llapa runa tiyashan.
But probably not like you.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana qan hinachu.
It’s all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta.
There was never anything.	Manam haykapipas imapas karqachu.
I’m doing it too.	Ñuqapas ruwachkani.
It’s been a very long time, now.	Ancha unayñam, kunanqa.
That’s why he’s there.	Chayraykum payqa chaypi kachkan.
Maybe it’s that bad.	Ichapas chayna mana allin.
She was as wounded as he was.	Payqa pay hinan k’irisqa kasqa.
Not now .	Kunan manam .
He knew how to do it right away.	Chaylla ruwayta yacharqa.
Someone was right in trouble.	Pipas allintam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
You do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwanki.
But here you are.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkanki.
I didn’t want him to be alone.	Manam munarqanichu sapallan kananta.
He looked much better.	Payqa aswan allinmi rikchakurqa.
And then he’s a great player.	Hinaspa chaymanta payqa hatun pukllaqmi.
Then it doesn't matter.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas imananpaschu.
Scientists are well aware of this.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa allintam yachanku chayta.
Everything is so amazing.	Tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi.
But, be a good person.	Ichaqa, allin runa kay.
I saw a story yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi huk willakuyta rikurqani.
But he didn’t want to, really.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu, cheqaqtapuni.
People are ridiculous.	Runakunaqa asikunapaq hinam.
That’s what he then decided to do with me.	Chaytan chaymantaqa yuyaykurqan ñoqawan ruwayta.
I couldn't believe it was happening.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
He was a good player, he’s a great guy.	Payqa allin pukllaqmi karqan, payqa hatun runan.
And he did very well out there.	Hinaspa ancha allinta ruwarqa chay hawapi.
He is not the best, probably the worst.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu, yaqapaschá aswan mana allinqa.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manañan.
Good morning good morning.	Allin p'unchaw allin p'unchaw.
Now this is something.	Kunanqa kayqa imapas.
They seem depressed.	Paykunaqa llakisqa hinam kanku.
I don't know exactly where it is.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmanta.
Better like this, actually.	Aswan allin kay hina, chiqaptaqa.
I've never done that to anyone.	Manam haykapipas pitapas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
Something is wrong with that.	Imapas chaypiqa manam allinchu.
I am, to be honest.	Ñuqaqa kani, chiqap rimanaypaq.
But he was sure of that now.	Ichaqa chaytan kunanqa seguro kasharqan.
That’s what they were.	Chaynatam paykunaqa karqaku.
Not as hungry as usual.	Mana sapa kuti hina yarqaymanta.
So it was a very difficult time.	Chaymi ancha sasa tiempo karqa.
Great, thank you.	Hatun, gracias.
I can’t do it all.	Manam tukuyta ruwayta atiymanchu.
But tell me why.	Ichaqa willaway imarayku.
This is what he knew.	Kaytam payqa yacharqa.
This was true madness.	Kayqa chiqap loco kaymi karqa.
He can't remember anyone.	Payqa manam pitapas yuyariyta atinchu.
Man that’s great.	Runa chaymi ancha allin.
And then at home.	Hinaspa chaymanta wasipi.
Such a pluralism cannot be ambiguous.	Chayna achka rimayqa manam iskay yuyayniyuqchu kanman.
He does everything right.	Tukuy imata allinta ruwan.
Not everyone knows everything about me.	Manan llapa runachu ñoqamanta tukuy imatapas yachanku.
He was a good man, she knew.	Payqa allin runan karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
I can do great things.	Hatun ruwaykunata ruwayman.
It’s available now.	Kunanmi kachkan.
Now, we’re crazy.	Kunanqa, loco kayku.
He hadn’t looked much all morning.	Payqa manan anchatachu tukuy paqarin qhawarisqa.
I didn’t want it to be real.	Manam munarqanichu chiqap kananta.
Anything can do that.	Imapas chayta ruwanman.
I did but not much.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani ichaqa manam anchatachu.
But he repeatedly refused.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi mana munarqanchu.
I just didn’t know how to tell it.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynatachus willayta.
Usually twice a week.	Yaqa llapanpim semanapi iskay kutita.
He and .	Payqa hinaspa .
No one seemed willing to agree.	Manan pipas chaywan acuerdopi kayta munasqanman hinachu karqan.
You always have your .	Qamqa sapa kutim qampaq .
Now, however, it is.	Kunanmi ichaqa chayna.
He wants nothing to do with you.	Payqa manan munanchu qanwan ima ruwaytapas.
He did not refuse to repair the house.	Payqa manan mana munarqanchu chay wasi allichayta.
He barely noticed it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa qhawarirqan.
If that’s okay with you.	Sichus chay allinchu qanwan.
People want this.	Runakunaqa kaytam munanku.
That wouldn’t be the case.	Chayqa manan hinachu kanman.
But you can’t sit there.	Ichaqa manan chaypi tiyayta atiwaqchu.
They are foolish.	Paykunaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I thought this would be an easy task.	Kayqa huk facil ruwaymi kananta yuyaykurqani.
It might not be so bad now.	Manapaschá kunanqa chhayna mana allinchu kanman.
And that would have been a stupid thing to do.	Hinaspa chayqa huk sonso ruwaymi kanman karqan.
Or in the morning.	Utaq tutamanta.
I still really want him back.	Hinallam anchata munani kutimunanta.
I do well with that.	Chaywanmi allinta ruwani.
Real people, and a real restaurant.	Chiqap runakuna, hinaspa chiqap mikhuy wasi.
Find out where the problem is.	Maypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta yachay.
He knew what it was like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kasqanmanta.
He came to my house.	Payqa wasiyman hamurqa.
But that was the summer.	Ichaqa chaymi karqan verano.
I feel very sad.	Sinchi llakisqa sientekuni.
You still can’t do it now.	Kunanqa manaraqmi atiwaqchu.
He seemed overwhelmed.	Payqa llumpay llakisqa hinam tarikurqa.
You are usually alone.	Yaqa llapanpim sapallayki kanki.
But he soon caught on.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan chayta hap’irqan.
Obviously there’s nothing without it.	Sut’inmi mana imapas kanchu mana chaywanqa.
It was amazing at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He is a cold man.	Payqa chiri runam.
I’m better now, he says.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi kani, nispas nin.
Such a wise man.	Chayna yachaysapa runa.
You want it to happen again.	Munanki yapamanta chayna kananta.
I wish it was me.	Munaymanmi karqan ñoqa kayqa.
The process will be easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi kanqa.

Go and do it.	Riy hinaspa ruway.
Yes, it is amazing there.	Arí, chaypiqa admirakuypaqmi.
I really, really did.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam ruwarqani.
So true in every respect.	Chaymi tukuy imapipas chiqap.
The process is difficult.	Chay ruwayqa sasam.
Never ever again.	Mana hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas.
It sounds ridiculous now.	Kunanqa asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
Know the real truth.	Cheqaq cheqaq kaqta yachay.
There is no other way you can do that.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanchu chayta ruwanaykipaq.

I'm fine, I just went to town.	Allinmi kachkani, chayllaraqmi llaqtaman rirqani.
Tell me what it means.	Willaway ima niyta munasqanmanta.

I mean, he's doing a lot.	Niyta munani, payqa achkatam ruwachkan.
I'd rather collaborate with you here.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaypi qanwan kuska llamk'ayta.
You were in a hurry.	Utqayllam karqanki.
But here is the funny thing.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkan asikunapaq kaq.
I don't really know why that is.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
This is a milestone.	Kayqa huk hatun ruwaymi.
No, it’s the other one.	Manan, huknin.
He sounds good.	Payqa allintam uyarikun.

Looks good as new.	Musuq hina allinmi rikchakun.
But someone was there.	Ichaqa pipas chaypi kasqa.
You weren't here in the summer.	Manam kaypichu karqanki chiri killapi.
The truth is there.	Cheqaq kaqmi chaypi kashan.
But it was very, very difficult.	Ichaqa ancha, ancha sasam karqa.
He took an important help.	Huk importante yanapayta hap’irqan.
He was happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kasqa.
I mean every night.	Sapa tutan niyta munani.
I want it to be black.	Yana kananta munani.
It just never worked out.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
Anyway one other learn.	Imayna kaptinpas huk huk yachay.
I seriously can’t believe this.	Serio mana creeyta atinichu kayta.
He did all of this.	Paymi tukuy chayta ruwarqa.
Is that really the case though.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayna ichaqa.
It’s really sad out there.	Chiqap llakikuypaqmi chay hawapi.
I know he is home.	Yachanim wasinpi kasqanmanta.
And, okay .	Hinaspa, allinmi .
But, we agree on that.	Ichaqa, chaymantaqa acuerdopi kayku.
I’m really sorry.	Chiqamanta llakikuni.
Such a statement is not well-thought-out.	Chhayna rimayqa manan allintachu yuyaykushan.
I want to be me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqa kayta munani.
Not better or worse.	Mana aswan allinchu nitaq aswan mana allinchu.
But the basic problem remains.	Ichaqa chay sasachakuy aswan allinqa hinallam kachkan.
All over the city.	Tukuy llaqtapi.
This is your insurance.	Kaymi qampaq seguro.
It just turned out badly.	Chayllaraqmi mana allinta lluqsirqa.
The first was the most recent.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan aswan qhepa kaq.
That’s what it sounds like.	Chaynatam uyarikun.
This is not that difficult.	Kayqa manam chayna sasachu.
But he had no idea how to do it.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatachus ruwananta.
I don’t know the right answer.	Manam yachanichu allin kutichiyta.
I can’t let this happen.	Manam atiymanchu kay pasananta.
But soon he was in the spotlight.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan payqa allinta qhawarisqa karqan.
It’s the best part of everything.	Tukuy imamanta aswan allin kaqmi.
If you know the answer.	Sichus yachanki chayqa.
I don't remember where.	Maypi kasqanmantaqa manam yuyarinichu.
And really now.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni kunan.
That’s kind of hard though.	Chayqa huk laya sasa ichaqa.
They are outside now.	Kunanqa hawapi kachkanku.
That was two weeks ago.	Chayqa iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
It certainly wouldn’t be the first time.	Chiqamanta mana ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
That’s last month.	Chayqa qayna killa.
Probably very tired.	Yaqapaschá ancha sayk’usqa.
It’s more stupid.	Aswan sonso.
There is nothing unique about it.	Chaypiqa manam imapas sapallan kanchu.
In fact, he actually did.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
Or a headdress.	Utaq uma p’acha.
This almost always happened.	Chayqa yaqa sapa kutim pasarqa.
An older man.	Huk kuraq runa.
Now, that was easy.	Kunanqa, chayqa facilmi karqa.
That was the way it was at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chayna hinam karqa.
It's too big so fast.	Ancha hatunmi chayna utqaylla.
Stop acting like you.	Amaña qan hina ruwaychu.
Great stuff here.	Hatun imakuna kaypi.
You don’t really know what he’s going to do next.	Mana allintachu yachanki imatachus qhepaman ruwananta.
I mean, it’s a big deal.	Niyta munani, hatun ruwaymi.
They were all there for him.	Llapallankum chaypi karqaku paypaq.
This happened a month ago.	Kayqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
Better the former than that.	Aswan allinmi chaymanta ñawpaq kaq.
That means both of them.	Chayqa iskayninku niyta munan.
Now he was a nice guy.	Kunanqa huk sumaq wayna kasqa.
Two months later he was.	Iskay killa qhepamanmi payqa karqan.
Another great achievement indeed.	Huk hatun ruway chiqap.
Everyone is involved in the process.	Lliwmi chay ruwaypi kachkanku.
Surely tomorrow would be better.	Cheqaqtapunin paqarin p’unchay aswan allin kanman.
Yes, as a matter of fact.	Arí, chiqap hina.
Hopefully, one day, I will find him.	Munaymanmi, huk punchaw, payta tariyta.
These are strangers.	Kaykunaqa mana riqsisqa runakunam.
I'm sure it doesn't mean that.	Seguro kani mana chayta niyta munanchu.
He can be a bit of a villain.	Payqa huk chikan millay runam kanman.
And this he did.	Hinaspa kayta ruwarqan.
It would certainly be easier.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan facil kanman.
No, it was a process.	Manan, huk ruwaymi karqan.
It can be as simple as that.	Chay hina facilmi kanman.
Repeat a few times.	Iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta niy.
I find that unfortunate.	Chaytaqa llakikuypaqmi hapini.
That’s a really good thing to do.	Chayqa cheqaq allin ruwaymi.
She could tell he was a little disappointed.	Payqa repararqanmi huk chhikanta hukmanyasqa kashasqanmanta.
But if you do that.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanki chayqa.
He didn’t know how to be serious.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatas serio kayta.
And then there was.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa karqan.
I wasn’t the only one who had this problem.	Manam ñuqallachu kay sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
It’s really, really cold.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta chiri kachkan.
I will not do that here.	Kaypiqa manam chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
I don’t have time before that.	Manaraq chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa tiempoy kanchu.
But they are no longer the best.	Ichaqa manañan aswan allinchu kanku.
They were tired and hungry.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima karqanku.
But we are smarter people.	Ichaqa aswan yachaysapa runakunam kanchik.
Maybe this is the best way.	Ichapas kayna aswan allin kanman.
They want to hear from you.	Paykunaqa qanmanta uyariyta munanku.
But this is too soon.	Ichaqa kayqa llumpay utqayllam.
This is what we are.	Kaymi kanchik.
But after some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempo qhepamanmi.
It’s really something that bad.	Chiqaptam imapas chayna mana allinqa.
He can no longer speak.	Manaña rimayta atinchu.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta rimayta munarqanchu.
Everything about him is wrong.	Paymanta tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
I actually like it better there.	Chiqaptaqa chaypiqa aswan allintam gustan.
He probably would have.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman karqan.
Don’t do that anymore!.	¡Amaña chayta ruwaychu!.
I really want that to happen.	Anchatam munani chayna kananta.
Of course, do that.	Chiqamanta, chayta ruway.
He was tired, to be honest.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasqa, cheqaqta rimananpaq.
Something known in something.	Imapas imapipas riqsisqa.
Both were excellent.	Iskayninkum ancha allin karqa.
Yes, that seems like a foregone conclusion.	Arí, chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi rikchakun.
He didn’t have to do those things.	Payqa manan chaykunataqa ruwananchu karqan.
He wasn’t much of a talker.	Payqa manan ancha rimaq runachu karqan.
Then again, he usually did.	Chaymanta yapamanta, payqa yaqa llapanpim ruwaq.
I really need to go.	Chiqamanta riyta necesitasaq.
There is not much you can do about this.	Kaymantaqa manam anchatachu ruwawaq.
That should be obvious by now.	Chayqa kunankamaqa sut’inmi kanan.
I’m sorry about that.	Chaywanmi llakikuni.
This day was not a good one.	Kay punchawqa manam allinchu karqa.
He was here yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi kaypi karqa.
So, do it.	Chaymi, ruway.
That’s a crazy talker.	Chayqa loco rimaq.
But maybe this was better.	Ichaqa ichapas kayna aswan allin karqa.
Why it seemed so familiar.	Imaraykutaq ancha riqsisqa rikchakurqa.
Do something that is worthwhile.	Imapas allinpaq kaqta ruway.
So tell me, and you will know.	Chay hinaqa, willaway, hinan yachanki.
They are childish and funny.	Paykunaqa wawa hina, asikunapaq hinam kanku.
We don’t always agree.	Manan sapa kutichu acuerdopi kayku.
The human race.	Runa laya.
First of all, that’s not true .	Ñawpaqtaqa, chayqa manan cheqaqchu .
I thought it would be quick.	Usqhaylla kananta yuyaykurqani.
It’s really not good enough.	Chiqaptam mana allinchu.
Nothing could be more real.	Manan imapas aswan cheqaqchu kanman.
This is not a duplicate.	Kayqa manam iskay kutichu.
It still doesn’t exist.	Kunankamapas manam kanchu.
Everything is pretty clear.	Tukuy imapas allin sut’inmi.
Unknown, unknown.	Mana riqsisqa, mana riqsisqa.
I could never come.	Manam haykapipas hamuyta atirqanichu.
He was so stupid.	Payqa ancha sonso kasqa.
He said he was a strange child.	Payqa mana riqsisqa wawa kasqanmantam nirqa.
It’s really not good at all.	Chiqaptaqa manam allinchu ni imapipas.
I think it’s better that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi yuyaykuni.
Yes, it was funny.	Arí, asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I have more than enough too.	Ñuqapas aswan achkatam hapini.
He's always serious.	Payqa sapa kutim serio kachkan.
They are doing great.	Paykunaqa hatun ruwaypi kachkanku.
It’s here and it’s there.	Kaypi kachkan chaymanta chaypi kachkan.
I didn’t know which one it was.	Manam yacharqanichu mayqin kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t think it will happen.	Manam yuyanichu chayna kananta.
I need everything from him.	Paymanta tukuy imatam necesitasaq.
You can do that in an amazing way.	Chaytaqa admirakuypaqmi ruwawaq.
They are anything but.	Paykunaqa imapas ichaqa.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa mana kanchu.
But he knew, of course.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi, cheqaqtapunin.
It would have continued.	Chayqa hinallam kanman karqa.
You were the best.	Aswan allinmi karqanki.
People are not.	Runakunaqa manam.
Funny for you that is.	Asikunapaq hina qampaq chaymi.
And then there was me.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ñuqa karqani.
However, this isn’t your situation.	Ichaqa, manan kayqa qanpa hinachu.
He knew full well that nothing could stop this.	Payqa allintam yacharqa mana imapas kayta harkayta atisqanmanta.
He should have been glad he felt so guilty.	Payqa kusisqa kanan karqan chhayna huchayoq sientekusqanmanta.
This seemed to be true.	Kayqa chiqap hinam karqa.
What he wants to do.	Ima munasqanmanta.
We can’t leave it there.	Manam chaypiqa saqiyta atichwanchu.
I do like you though.	Ñuqaqa qampaq hinam ichaqa.
What is he doing outside? 	¿Imatataq hawapi ruwachkan?
They want to leave.	Paykunaqa ripuyta munanku.
But not everyone is.	Ichaqa manan llapa runachu.
He can’t talk at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas rimayta atinchu.
But man, it was just so good.	Ichaqa runa, chaylla ancha allinmi karqa.
He was supposed to be playing with her.	Payqa paywan pukllaqmi kanan karqa.
Doing something well is a lot of work.	Imatapas allinta ruwayqa achka ruwaymi.
He did these things alone.	Chaykunataqa sapallanmi ruwarqa.
It didn't seem very good to talk.	Mana ancha allinchu rikchakurqa rimayqa.
I am well aware that this is not easy.	Allintam yachani kayqa mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
I never see him again.	Manañam haykapipas paytaqa rikunichu.
It’s a really terrible day.	Chiqamanta manchay p’unchaw.
I want it to be there.	Chaypi kananta munani.
Someone knew too much about him.	Pipas paymanta llumpayta yacharqa.
Which is unthinkable.	Imataq mana yuyayniyuq.
Again, it could be wrong.	Yapamanta, pantasqa kanman.
This is certainly the worst.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa aswan mana allinqa.
Now he tried to do what was right.	Kunanqa kallpachakurqanmi allin ruwaykunata ruwananpaq.
That would be a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
He knew exactly what was going to happen.	Payqa allintam yacharqa imakuna pasananta.
That was quite something.	Chayqa ancha imapas karqa.
This all makes a lot more sense.	Kay tukuy imapas aswan achka yuyayniyuqmi kachkan.
But the second was better.	Ichaqa iskay kaqmi aswan allin karqa.
They want you to be like everyone else.	Paykunaqa munanku llapa runakuna hina kanaykita.
So now it's working.	Chaymi kunanqa llank'ashan.
He was very happy that day.	Chay punchawqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqa.
Mindfulness is not difficult.	Yuyayniyuq kayqa manam sasachu.
I was the most admired person in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan admirasqa runam karqani.
Sure, he was great.	Seguro, payqa hatunmi karqa.
Something had to go wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanan karqa.
Obviously, that wasn’t the case.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Again, nothing wrong.	Yapamanta, mana imapas mana allinchu.
It’s not easy being him.	Manan facilchu pay kayqa.
Yes, the last person.	Arí, qhipa kaq runa.
Please tell me how it is.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway imayna kasqanmanta.
He is not so sure.	Payqa manan chay hina segurochu kashan.
It was such a difficult task.	Chayna sasa ruwaymi karqa.
One of them is an adult.	Hukninmi hatun runa.
Have a better attitude.	Aswan allin yuyayniyuq kay.
I really couldn’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu.
That might be the worst thing you can do.	Chay ruwayqa yaqapaschá aswan mana allinqa kanman.
That was the only way we walked all afternoon.	Chayllam tukuy tarde puriq kayku.
Monday will be a new day.	Lunes punchawmi musuq punchaw kanqa.
Nothing can ever do that.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
It was a very big day for me.	Ancha hatun punchawmi karqa ñuqapaq.
But he could not come.	Ichaqa manam hamuyta atirqachu.
Make more money with us.	Aswan achka qullqita ñuqaykuwan ruway.
I'm waiting for the message.	Willayta suyachkani.
To be good again.	Yapamanta allin kananpaq.
In fact, he probably would.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman.
He goes to my school.	Yachay wasiyman rin.
I was supposed to be a teacher.	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kanay karqa.
It should be like that now, but it wasn’t.	Kunanqa chhayna kanan, ichaqa manan karqanchu.
He didn’t say it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan nirqanchu.
He has always existed.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
And then if you’re older.	Hinaspa chaymanta sichus kuraq kanki chayqa.
I didn’t want it here.	Manam kaypiqa munarqanichu.
Otherwise, it was better.	Mana chayna kaptinqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Otherwise, it won’t be.	Mana chayqa, manan kanqachu.
We are new people.	Musuq runakunam kanchik.
I don't think he'll be disappointed.	Manam piensanichu hukmanyasqa kananta.
He thought a lot about you.	Payqa anchatan qanmanta yuyaykurqan.
I was a teacher.	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi karqani.
With all that.	Tukuy chaywan.
Something very secretive.	Imapas ancha pakasqa.
If not, it was fine.	Mana kaptinqa allinmi karqa.
Now the truth is here.	Kunanqa cheqaq kaqmi kaypi kashan.
No one would agree.	Manan pipas acuerdopichu kanman.
Here you are right now.	Kaypim kunan kachkanki.
Maybe that’s the secret.	Ichapas chay pakasqa kachkan.
I really can't believe it, at all.	Chiqaptaqa manam creeyta atinichu, ni imapipas.
So far, he hasn’t been able to.	Kunankamaqa manam atirqachu.
I was cold, very cold.	Chiri karqani, ancha chiri.
He wants to work.	Payqa llamkayta munan.
I hope everyone is fine.	Suyachkani llapallanku allin kasqankuta.
It means you are guilty.	Huchayoq kasqaykita niyta munan.
He knew one was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi huknin hamunanta.
But the house.	Ichaqa wasi.
This, however, is not a good thing.	Kayqa ichaqa manan allinchu.
It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t.	Manam imananpaschu, manañam.
He is very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kachkan.
It just can’t be done.	Chaylla mana atinchu.
So busy now.	Chaymi kunan ocupasqa.
This was indeed overwhelming.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa sinchi hatun karqan.
I know that makes no sense.	Yachanim chayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
He's hurt, hurt, sad.	Payqa k'irisqa, k'irisqa, llakisqa.
But this is what it should be.	Ichaqa kaymi kanan.
It’s hard to talk about this.	Kaymanta rimayqa sasam.
He was being ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam kachkarqa.
I was here every day.	Sapa punchawmi kaypi karqani.
They weren’t always there.	Manan sapa kutichu karqanku.
A man began to sing.	Huk runam takiyta qallaykurqa.
No one will have to do it alone.	Manan pipas sapallanchu ruwanan kanqa.
The best thing to do was to act quickly.	Chaylla ruwaymi aswan allinqa karqa.
And, this process will be a very good one.	Hinaspa, kay ruwayqa kanqa huk ancha allin.
Almost immediately.	Yaqa chaylla.
That’s right, people.	Chayqa, runakuna.
He is an adult.	Payqa kuraq runam.
He knows what he’s going to do.	Yachan ima ruwananta.
But he knew the way well.	Ichaqa allintam chay ñanta yacharqa.
It’s really not good enough.	Chiqaptaqa manam allinchu.
Everyone is guilty.	Lliwmi huchayoq kanku.
And then he was angry.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa phiñasqa karqan.
So, if nothing else .	Chaymi, mana imapas kaptinqa .
It’s like a child.	Chayqa wawa hinam.
Everything came out of it.	Tukuy ima chaymanta lluqsirqa.
But it is not enough	Ichaqa manan chayllachu .
He wants it to be better.	Payqa munanmi aswan allin kananta.
I will never be able to sleep here.	Kaypiqa manam haykapipas puñuyta atisaqchu.
Everything seemed very, very good.	Tukuy imapas ancha allin, ancha allin hinam rikchakurqa.
Someone could be here, hidden.	Pipas kaypi kanman, pakasqa.
But there’s something serious about this.	Ichaqa kanmi sinchita kaymantaqa.
I didn’t want to know any more about it.	Chaymantaqa manañam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
But, here we are.	Ichaqa, kaypim kachkaniku.
He still kind of does it all the time.	Hinallam huk laya ruwan sapa kuti.
I like this guy.	Kay runam gustan.
He looks very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam rikchakun.
Everything happened so fast.	Tukuy imapas chayna utqayllam karqa.
That everyone is safer now.	Kunanqa llapallanku aswan seguro kasqankuta.
And they were fine.	Hinan paykunaqa allin karqanku.
Yes, it is a practice.	Arí, chaytaqa ruwaymi.
They were too fast for me.	Paykunaqa llumpay utqayllam ñuqapaq karqa.
He gave me a job to do for him.	Paymi huk llamkayta quwarqa paypaq ruwanaypaq.
What is happening now.	Kunan imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He didn’t always do that, anymore.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq, manañan.
That means there is a reality.	Chayqa niyta munan huk chiqap kasqanmanta.
And now, here we are again.	Hinaspa kunan, kaypi yapamanta kayku.
There it was, the truth.	Chaypin kasqa, cheqaq kaq.
He seemed a bit surprised by her reaction.	Payqa huk chhikantan admirasqa hina karqan chay ruwasqanmanta.
It’s beautiful there.	Chaypiqa sumaqmi.
One is the action.	Hukninmi ruway.
So yeah, it’s important, he says.	Chaymi arí, importante, nispas nin.
But it really does matter.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin importante.
Now here’s the hard part.	Kunanqa kaypi sinchi kaq.
That may never happen.	Chayqa manapaschá hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
So, it’s very smart.	Chaymi, ancha yachaysapa.
It’s a really, really nice thing to do.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sumaq ruway.
This was rather stupid it was crazy.	Kayqa aswan sonso karqan loco karqan.
Actually, he was right.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa allintam nirqa.
That's obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut'inmi mana allinchu.
The better it is, the better.	Allin kaptinqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
But you know it well.	Ichaqa allintan yachanki.
He’s better than that.	Payqa chaymantaqa aswan allinmi.
Everything is happy.	Tukuy imapas kusisqam kachkan.
First of all, it’s beautiful.	Ñawpaqtaqa sumaqmi.
A new baby.	Musuq wawa.
They were extremely cold.	Paykunaqa sinchi chiri karqanku.
In fact, he was no longer feeling well.	Aswanpas manañan allinchu kasharqan.
I knew what it would be like.	Yacharqanim imayna kananta.
Crazy man.	Loco runa.
There is no easy way to do this.	Chaypaqqa manan facil ruwayqa kanchu.
But you can’t stay.	Ichaqa manan qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
He was the player, he said.	Paymi pukllaq karqan, nispa.
There is no better way to do it.	Manan aswan allin ruwayqa kanchu.
I had no reason to do the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwanaypaqqa manam imaraykupas karqachu.
But it’s really good.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin allin.
He couldn't say it.	Payqa manam niyta atirqachu.
I’m not a rich man, you know.	Manam qhapaq runachu kani, yachanki.
Everything will be according to his will.	Tukuy imapas ima munasqanman hinam kanqa.
All right that way, maybe.	Allinmi chayna, ichapas.
At least not at all.	Aswanpas manan imapipas.
He was lucky, he knew.	Payqa suerteyoqmi karqan, chaytan yacharqan.
But he doesn’t want to be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypi kayta munanchu.
I didn't want to work there anymore.	Manañam chaypi llamkayta munarqanichu.
You want to, too.	Qampas munanki.
I hope you mean something else.	Suyachkani hukta niyta munanki.
We really need to do something.	Chiqaptam imatapas ruwananchik.
But there was nothing of the sort.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
They want the world to be that much bigger.	Paykunaqa munanku kay pacha chay aswan hatun kananta.
I was with him the whole time.	Tukuy tiempon paywan karqani.
You are a part of me.	Qamqa ñuqapa hukninmi kanki.
He didn’t do much new work during that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan askha mosoq llank’ayta ruwarqanchu.
It won’t happen unless you do.	Manan kanqachu manachus chayta ruwawaq chayqa.
He seems like a nice guy.	Sumaq runa hinam rikchakun.
Something will come of it.	Imapas chaymanta hamunqa.
This process is not difficult.	Kay ruwayqa mana sasachu.
The first was speed.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan usqhaylla.
Everyone is guilty.	Llapa runan huchayoq.
It shouldn’t be a good thing.	Manam allinchu kanan.
Everything at the same time.	Tukuy imapas kikin pachapi.
Other than that, things worked out.	Mana chaymantaqa, imapas allintam lluqsirqa.
That’s what he does and he does what’s right.	Chaytan ruwan allin kaqta ruwan.
Here’s about it .	Kaypiqa chaymanta .
He doesn’t want to be alone.	Payqa manam sapallan kayta munanchu.
So he wasn’t sure.	Chaymi payqa mana segurochu kasqa.
But I’ve got that.	Ichaqa chaytan hap’ini.
I think he expected that.	Chayta suyakusqanmanta yuyaykuni.
A man who needs to win, never does.	Huk runa atipayta necesitan, mana hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
That’s not a good thing anymore.	Chayqa manañam allinchu.
So that’s it.	Chaymi chayna.
I did all of that wrong.	Tukuy chaykunataqa mana allintachu ruwarqani.
He had nothing to do with that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
But it was probably a lot.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá askha karqan.
However, it’s not quite.	Ichaqa, manan allintachu.
He recently faced a similar challenge.	Chayllaraqmi chayna sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I'm injured.	K'irisqa kani.
Maybe it was there all along.	Ichapas tukuy tiempo chaypi karqa.
How could he do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwanman karqa.
Please do the right thing.	Ama hina kaspa, allin kaqta ruway.
I look forward to hearing more.	Astawan uyariyta suyachkani.
I can’t even do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwaytapas atiymanchu.
It’s not good at all.	Manam allinchu ni imapipas.
Not then and there.	Mana chaymanta chaypichu.
He died afterwards.	Chay qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
So many that it's not worth it.	Ancha achka chaymi mana valenchu.
Not sure what he means by that.	Mana segurochu chaywan ima niyta munan.
But he couldn't tell her that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa willayta atirqanchu.
One night after another was bad.	Huk tutamanta huk tutan mana allinchu karqan.
That or nothing.	Chayqa icha mana imapas.
Important, if true.	Importante, sichus chiqap kaptinqa.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa atiymanchu.
No one, right now, can say.	Mana pipas, kunanpacha, niyta atinchu.
He was such a tough guy.	Payqa chayna sinchi runam karqa.
But, that’s all he told me.	Ichaqa, chayllam niwarqa.
I don’t know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
Actually, it’s not very good.	Chiqaptaqa, mana ancha allinchu.
Then a third time.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq kutipi.
It was pretty crazy here.	Kaypiqa ancha loco karqa.
But it doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun chay ruwayqa.
I'm a little busy.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan ocupasqa kachkani.
And so you said yes.	Hinaspa chaymi arí nirqanki.
I wasn't ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manam listochu karqani.
Above all else.	Tukuy imamanta aswan hatun.
Obviously this is so.	Sut’inmi kayqa chhayna kasqanmanta.
Another great player.	Huk hatun pukllaq.
This means the former.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq niyta munan.
Good is good, bad is bad.	Allinmi allin, mana allinqa mana allinmi.
Mary was always beautiful.	Mariaqa sapa kutim sumaq rikchayniyuq karqa.
This guy knows it.	Kay runaqa yachanmi.
He thought it was ugly.	Payqa piensaranmi millay kananpaq.
He thought he was a great man.	Payqa hatun runa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
Not a big deal all day.	Mana hatun ruwaychu tukuy punchaw.
He knows what it’s all about.	Payqa yachanmi imamanta kasqanmanta.
I don't know what to do about it.	Manam yachanichu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
I want to do other things.	Huk ruwaykunata ruwayta munani.
Now, at least.	Kunanqa, aswan pisi.
One looked very familiar.	Hukninmi ancha riqsisqa rikchakurqa.
Seriously, he's a good guy.	Serio, payqa allin runam.
I want to stay with you, tonight.	Qanwan qhepakuyta munani, kunan tuta.
One this year, maybe.	Huknin kay wata, ichapas kanman.
This will have to be quick.	Kayqa utqaylla kanan kanqa.
I am, of course.	Ñuqapas kani, sut’inmi.
So he went himself.	Chaymi pay kikin rirqa.
It's all about what's important to you.	Tukuy imapas qampaq imakuna ancha allin kasqanmantam.
There, that’s a good guy.	Chaypi, chayqa allin runa.
He couldn’t find it.	Payqa manan tariyta atirqanchu.
I just don’t know what the problem could be.	Chaylla mana yachanichu ima sasachakuy kanman chayta.
I actually thought that was the problem.	Chiqaptaqa chay sasachakuy kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I’m ready to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi listo kashani.
Now you never can.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas atiwaqchu.
He was very tired.	Payqa llumpay sayk’usqa kasqa.
I thought about that all the time.	Chaypiqa sapa kutim piensarqani.
The process had to be repeated twice.	Chay ruwayqa iskay kutita ruwana karqa.
That was the only thing that mattered.	Chayllam ancha allin karqa.
Sure it would be wrong.	Seguro pantasqa kanman.
He probably knows by now.	Yaqapaschá kunankamaqa yachan.
He’s been right this whole time.	Payqa kay tukuy tiempon allinta rimarqan.
Everything worked out really well.	Tukuy imapas chiqap allintam lluqsirqa.
Which is the truth.	Imataq chiqap kasqanmanta.
I don’t like that.	Chayqa manam gustanchu.
The one that came first.	Chay ñawpaqta hamuq.
I can't work properly.	Mana allintachu llamk'ayta atiyman.
Now you have to do it.	Kunanqa ruwanayki tiyan.
Perhaps he is right about that.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa allinta rimachkan.
It would be the unknown.	Chay mana riqsisqa kaqmi kanman.
That was a week ago.	Chayqa karqan huk semana ñawpaqta.
All the time.	Tukuy tiempopi.
I couldn’t resist that.	Chaytaqa manan hark’ayta atirqanichu.
He was quite clear.	Payqa allin sut’inmi karqan.
If you know what you need to do, do it.	Ima ruwanaykita yachanki chayqa, ruway.
I didn’t disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopichu karqani.
Happy birthday early.	Kusisqa p'unchaw temprano.
It’s easy there.	Chaypiqa facilmi.
I used to be a very good teacher.	Ñawpaqtaqa ancha allintam yachachiq kani.
That’s a difficult thing to do, after all.	Chayqa sasa ruwaymi, tukuy imamanta.
Nothing could take it.	Manan imapas chaytaqa hap’iyta atirqanchu.
I know exactly how it is.	Yachanim allinta imayna kasqanmanta.
One, two, three weeks.	Huk, iskay, kimsa semana.
I never did anything to him.	Manam haykapipas paytaqa imatapas ruwarqanichu.
It was somewhere.	Maypipas kasqa.
There was nothing like that.	Chay hinaqa manan imapas karqanchu.
But nothing seems right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu rikchakun.
You are doing the right thing here.	Kaypiqa allintam ruwachkanki.
So you probably think yes.	Chaymi yaqapaschá arí nispa yuyaykunki.
This process would still continue.	Kay ruwayqa kunankamapas hinallam kanman karqa.
The truth was far worse.	Cheqaq kaqmi aswan millay karqan.
I didn't know it existed until now.	Kunankamaqa manam yacharqanichu kasqanmantaqa.
I am such a great person.	Chayna hatun runam kani.
Of course, he knew what he needed to do.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta necesitasqanmanta.
I will never be like you.	Manam haykapipas qam hinachu kasaq.
Unique .	Sapa .
I know .	Yachanim .
It will probably be all day.	Yaqapaschá tukuy punchaw kanqa.
Other than that, who knows.	Huk chaymanta, pi yachan.
So at that time	Chaymi chay tiempopi .
I want him to know this about me.	Kayta ñuqamanta yachananta munani.
He thought about how he did it.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imayna ruwasqanpi.
We are already in serious trouble.	Ñam hatun sasachakuypi kachkaniku.
This was not always a good thing.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu allin karqa.
Yes, that was him.	Arí, chaymi pay karqa.
What do you think is the biggest thing?.	¿Imataq aswan hatun kasqanmanta yuyanki?.
I was tired all day.	Tukuy punchawmi sayk’usqa karqani.
He doesn’t know what to do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas yachanchu.
Now that will be the priority.	Kunanqa chaymi ñawpaqpi kanqa.
A year and a half.	Huk wata kuskan.
He desperately wanted a cigarette.	Payqa sinchitan munarqan cigarrota.
It will be a good thing.	Allin kaqmi kanqa.
That’s the hard part.	Chayqa sasa kaqmi.
He knows he is a child.	Payqa yachanmi wawa kasqanmanta.
Maybe, he says.	Ichapas, nispas nin.
Now he’s the man.	Kunanqa paymi chay runa.
I always did that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
That seemed reasonable.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
He doesn’t want to work that hard.	Payqa manan chay hinata llank’ayta munanchu.
But it’s better now than nothing.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kunan mana imamantapas.
All right, thank you.	Allinmi, gracias.
Being unknown.	Mana riqsisqa kay.
Less than ten days, in fact.	Manaraq chunka p’unchawchu, chiqaptaqa.
Things did not go well.	Imapas manam allintachu rirqa.
He wanted to be arrested.	Payqa hapisqa kaytam munarqa.
I’m proud of that.	Chaywanmi orgulloso kani.
He couldn't remember ever being so hungry.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu hayk’aqpas chay hina yarqasqa kashasqanmanta.
But you don’t want to hear that.	Ichaqa manan chayta uyariyta munankichu.
He didn’t say that exactly.	Payqa manan chayta allintachu nisqa.
This one really can.	Kayqa chiqaptam atinman.
I can walk there.	Chaypi puriyta atiyman.
I feel great now.	Kunanqa hatunmi sientekuni.
Cold, sad, lonely.	Chiri, llakisqa, sapallan.
Not really.	Mana chiqaptaqa.
I'm really sorry about this.	Chiqaptam llakikuni kaymanta.
The two were friends.	Iskayninkum amigontin karqaku.
There was a problem.	Chaypin huk sasachakuy karqan.
He wanted to sleep but couldn't.	Puñuyta munarqa ichaqa manam puñuyta atirqachu.
I am something though.	Ñuqaqa imapas kani ichaqa.
This is just ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinallam.
Can't be long now.	Mana unaytachu kunanqa kanman.
And a lot of other people, it sounds like.	Hinaspa achka huk runakuna, chayna uyarikun.
And actually here you are.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa kaypi kachkanki.
I mean everything is like that.	Tukuy imapas chayna kasqanmantam niyta munani.
But you, however .	Ichaqa qanmi ichaqa .
You are the greatest.	Qamqa aswan hatunmi kanki.
This means something is wrong.	Kayqa imapas mana allin kasqanmantam niyta munan.
He may say one thing and do another.	Ichapas hukta nispan hukta ruwanman.
But he really got into it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayman haykurqan.
He was sick.	Unqusqa kasqa.
Everyone, however .	Tukuy runa ichaqa .
This is then absurd.	Kayqa chaymantaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
It was meant to be.	Chayqa karqan chay hina kananpaqmi.
I knew you would be happy.	Yacharqanim kusisqa kanaykita.
Go, another go.	Riy, huk riy.
I’ll make a story.	Huk willakuyta ruwasaq.
He knew what this was about.	Payqa yacharqanmi imamanta kayqa kasqanmanta.
I never saw that not happening.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chayna mana pasananta.
There was no point in doing so.	Manañam imapaqpas chay ruwayqa karqachu.
I ask myself very often.	Ancha sapa kutim tapukuni.
I know how bad it is.	Yachanim imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
That will be the hardest part.	Chayqa aswan sasa kaqmi kanqa.
I have no reason to do that.	Manam imaraykupas chayta ruwanaypaqqa kanchu.
He’ll do it.	Payqa ruwanqa.
But of course that’s not true.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I wonder who is better.	Tapukuni pitaq aswan allinqa.
I’m not going to go there.	Manam chayman risaqchu.
Late again, baby.	Tarde yapamanta, wawa.
I'm actually proud of it.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam orgulloso kani.
Yes, he looked a little annoyed.	Arí, huk chikan phiñasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
That’s nice, man.	Chayqa sumaqmi, runa.
How does he.	Imaynatataq payqa.
First of all, they’re great.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ancha sumaqmi kanku.
It’s just very difficult.	Chaylla ancha sasa.
They are, here and there.	Paykunaqa kanku, kaypi chaypi.
Maybe even though it is.	Ichapas chayna kaptinpas.
It was, several times.	Chayqa karqan, askha kutita.
Being here without him wasn't good enough.	Mana paywan kaypi kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
He was deported later that year.	Chay wata qhepamanmi nacionmanta qarqosqa karqan.
It may be true.	Chiqap kanman.
Everything is uncertain.	Tukuy imapas mana segurochu.
But it's all very simple.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas ancha facilmi.
All very well and good.	Tukuy ancha allin hinaspa allin.
I couldn't take the chance.	Manam chay oportunidadta hapiyta atirqanichu.
They really were.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam karqaku.
He doesn’t live there.	Payqa manam chaypichu tiyan.
Probably never at all.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas ni imapipas.
They are good people.	Allinmi kanku runakuna.
It should be the next step.	Qatiqnin ruwaymi kanan.
A month ago.	Huk killa ñawpaqta.
That was later on.	Chayqa qhepamanmi karqan.
I think you know who this is.	Yuyaykuni pichus kay kasqanmanta yachasqaykita.
Now, he said.	Kunanqa, nispas nisqa.
Glad to be here.	Kusisqa kaypi kasqaymanta.
It wasn't the safest.	Manam aswan segurochu karqa.
Yes, indeed many.	Arí, chiqaptam achka.
One player did it.	Huk pukllaqmi chayta ruwarqan.
It will be faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanqa.
Something harmful, actually.	Imapas mana allin ruwaq, chiqaptaqa.
I want to walk, anywhere.	Puriyta munani, maymanpas.
Yeah, that would be really nice.	Arí, chayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanman.
We are such people.	Chayna runakunam kanchik.
I think he is crazy.	Loco kasqanmantam piensani.
Not sure what where they are.	Mana segurochu imatachus maypi kasqankuta.
When you think about it, it’s kind of crazy.	Chayta yuyaykunki chayqa, huk laya loco hinan.
He had been around for a long time.	Payqa unayñan kasqa.
It just did and did.	Chayllaraqmi chayta ruwarqa hinaspa ruwarqa.
I could never give up.	Manam haykapipas saqiyta atiymanchu karqa.
He’s too good for her.	Payqa ancha allinmi paypaq.
He’s fine with that.	Payqa allinmi chayta.
There is nothing he can do to help her.	Manan ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu yanapananpaq.
Tell me that again.	Chayta hukmanta willaway.
Better yet, do it right.	Aswan allinqa allinta ruway.
I want to see this game through.	Kay pukllayta tukuyta rikuyta munani.
One could not say that.	Huk runaqa manan chaytaqa rimayta atirqanchu.
I mean, if you want to.	Niyta munani, munaspaqa.
Usually both, alternately.	Yaqa llapanpim iskayninku, hukmanta hukmanta.
Not this guy anyway.	Mana kay runachu imayna kaptinpas.
Everyone knows it.	Llapallankum yachanku.
No one quite for whatever reason.	Manan pipas allintachu imaraykupas.
Yeah, something like that.	Arí, imapas chayna.
And then what will happen to him.	Hinaspa chaymanta imataq paywan kanqa.
Yes, almost every day.	Arí, yaqa sapa punchaw.
But you are a newcomer.	Ichaqa chayllaraq hamuq runam kanki.
But this is what matters.	Ichaqa kaymi importante.
He's really proud of you.	Payqa chiqaptam qammanta orgulloso kachkan.
What ever happened to him?.	¿Imataq haykapipas paywan pasarqa?.
I wanted to play this year.	Kay wata pukllayta munarqani.
I saw this today.	Kunanmi kayta rikurqani.
It’s been about a year.	Yaqa huk watañam.
He couldn't go anywhere.	Payqa manam maymanpas riyta atirqachu.
Not like he’s drunk.	Mana machasqa hinachu.
They are very angry.	Paykunaqa sinchi phiñasqa kashanku.
Some people are	Wakin runakunaqa .
Don’t ever do no.	Ama hayk’aqpas ruwaychu mana.
This man was very drunk.	Kay runaqa ancha machasqa kasqa.
Perhaps it does.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwan.
And that, perhaps, is a good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa, yaqapaschá, allin kaq.
I didn’t know what to do next.	Manam yacharqanichu qatiqnin ruwayta.
I couldn’t believe he might not.	Manapaschá creeyta atirqanichu manapaschá chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
This sounds interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi uyarikun.
But he didn’t say no.	Ichaqa manan nirqanchu mana nispa.
This was as it should be.	Kayqa imayna kanan hinam karqa.
He talked a lot about his feelings.	Payqa anchatan rimaq imachus sientekusqanmanta.
Everything will be better, tomorrow.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinmi kanqa, paqarin.
Why do you want someone else to be.	¿Imanasqataq munanki huk runa kananta.
Sure, they want to know.	Seguro, paykunaqa yachayta munanku.
You want to tell that story.	Chay willayta willayta munanki.
Ten years ago, maybe.	Chunka wata ñawpaqta, ichapas.
If you know, or not.	Sichus yachanki, icha mana.
Two for him, two for her.	Iskay paypaq, iskay paypaq.
He looked unimpressed.	Payqa mana admirasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
But such talk is useless.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​kay hina rimayqa.
I know that probably sounds strange.	Yachanim chayqa ichapas mana riqsisqa hina uyarikun.
I wonder how that would have happened.	Tapukuni imaynataq chay kanman karqa.
He looked outside.	Payqa hawaman qhawarisqa.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
That's bigger than what happened to him.	Chayqa aswan hatunmi paywan pasasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to leave you here.	Manam kaypi saqiyta munanichu.
He was never bad.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allinchu karqan.
It was a cold winter day.	Chayqa chiri chiri punchawmi karqa.
But if that’s true, it’s a pretty big deal.	Ichaqa sichus chay cheqaq kanman chayqa, sinchi hatun ruwaymi.
Today is amazing.	Kunan punchawqa admirakuypaqmi.
He would be angry.	Payqa phiñasqa kanman.
Actually, it was worse.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan mana allinmi karqa.
One of the girls goes.	Huknin sipasmi rin.
That he knew he was innocent.	Mana huchayoq kasqanmanta yachasqanmanta.
I can’t stop walking.	Manam puriyta saqiyta atiymanchu.
It is really important to say that he is too human.	Chiqaptam ancha allin llumpay runa kasqanmanta rimayqa.
It almost seemed like he wanted to play.	Yaqapaschá pukllayta munanman hina karqa.
It’s not the easiest.	Manan aswan facilchu.
You need to do them regularly.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutillanmi ruwanayki.
But he probably had no choice.	Ichaqa manapaschá ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
That would be a bad thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I still don’t know yet.	Kunankamapas manaraqmi yachanichu.
This is the biggest thing.	Kaymi aswan hatun kaq.
It's not really worth it.	Mana valenchu ​​chiqaptapuni.
You said ten o’clock.	Chunka horasta nirqanki.
I found it very difficult to do so.	Ancha sasam tarikurqani chayta ruwayqa.
It's not that bad here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
Or anyone really.	Utaq pipas chiqaptapuni.
Later, .	Qhepamanmi, .
He sounds devastated.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa hinan uyarikun.
If not, you have to do it.	Mana chayqa, ruwanayki tiyan.
But? 	Ichaqa?
There weren’t many people.	Manam achka runakunaqa karqachu.
But I don’t see that that’s the case.	Ichaqa manan rikunichu chay hina kasqanmantaqa.
A child from the city.	Llaqtamanta huk wawa.
And maybe that time.	Hinaspa ichapas chay pacha.
He had them early on.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaykunataqa hap’irqan.
He couldn't bear to hear it.	Manas aguantayta atirqachu chayta uyariyta.
I intend to do it right.	Allinta ruwayta yuyaykuni.
He looked sad and angry.	Payqa llakisqa, phiñasqa qhawarisqa.
And it’s actually good.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa allinmi.
I didn't do well that night.	Chay tutaqa manam allintachu ruwarqani.
They were very good at it.	Paykunaqa ancha allintam chaypi karqaku.
I’m always like this.	Sapa kutim kayna kani.
You were intelligent.	Yuyayniyuqmi karqanki.
They were stupid people.	Paykunaqa mana yuyayniyuq runakunam karqaku.
There would be food anywhere.	Maypipas mikhuy kanman.
There’s no big secret.	Manam hatun pakasqa kanchu.
Or, he did that.	Utaq, chayta ruwarqa.
I really think he was scared.	Chiqaptam piensani mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
He was in a car.	Payqa huk carropi kasharqan.
What is so wrong about him? 	¿Imataq paymanta ancha mana allin?
Beautiful and more beautiful.	Sumaq hinaspa aswan sumaq.
They were so sure.	Paykunaqa chayna segurom karqaku.
It’s a good thing for him.	Paypaq allin ruway.
I don’t want to be speechless either.	Ñoqapas manan mana rimaq kayta munanichu.
It’s been around for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan kashan.
He doesn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munanchu.
Now this is amazing.	Kunanqa kayqa admirakuypaqmi.
Do it with it.	Chaywan ruway.
He is not uncertain about that.	Chaymantaqa manam mana segurochu kachkan.
It may not be right for you.	Manapaschá qampaq allinchu kanman.
He didn’t speak well.	Payqa manan allintachu rimarqan.
I have no idea where the problem is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Forgive me, now.	Pampachaykuway, kunan.
That can never work.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas llank’ayta atinmanchu.
This is really sad.	Kayqa chiqap llakikuypaqmi.
He came here every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi kayman hamurqa.
I can't hold it that long.	Manam chayna unaytachu hapiyta atiyman.
But that doesn’t always have to be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanan.
Who can do it faster.	Pitaq aswan utqaylla ruwayta atinman.
But he knew he could never do that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
A lot of things.	Achka imapas.
But there is something wrong.	Ichaqa kanmi imapas mana allin.
Today is the day.	Kunan punchawmi chay punchaw.
But he can’t hold it.	Ichaqa manan hap’iyta atinmanchu.
That meant, nothing, really.	Chayqa niyta munarqa, mana imapas, chiqaptapuni.
He seemed terribly worried about something.	Payqa imamantapas manchay llakisqa hinam karqa.
And he was barely arrested.	Hinan payqa yaqapaschá hap’isqa kasharqan.
That’s what’s interesting about that.	Chayqa chaymantaqa sumaqmi.
It wasn’t, you know.	Manam karqachu, yachanki.
So something is wrong here.	Chaymi kaypi imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
He was so happy, so happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa, ancha kusisqa kasqa.
So it’s not like you.	Chaymi mana qan hinachu.
It will be pretty easy.	Allin facilmi kanqa.
Tell me what it is.	Willaway ima kasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, that's all there is to it.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayllam kachkan.
Maybe once or twice.	Ichapas huk kutilla iskay kutilla.
They want to be happy here.	Kaypiqa kusisqa kayta munanku.
Say yourself again.	Hukmanta niy imayna kasqaykita.
You know, this was there.	Yachanki, kayqa chaypim karqa.
He was very much like you.	Payqa anchatan qan hina karqan.
You are or you are not.	Qamqa kanki icha manachu kanki.
But he was pretty sure.	Ichaqa payqa allintan seguro kasqa.
As if something is terribly, terribly wrong.	Imapas manchay, manchay mana allinchu kanman hina.
Yes, that's obvious.	Arí, chayqa sut'inmi.
Obviously, this wouldn’t work.	Sut’inmi, kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
That’s why you do what you do.	Chayraykum ruwasqaykita ruwanki.
That would not have worked at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu kanman karqan.
So that’s all morning.	Chaymi chayqa tukuy paqarin.
The bad guys.	Mana allin runakuna.
He is no longer sure what the truth is.	Payqa manañan segurochu kashan imachus cheqaq kasqanmantaqa.
I made him that way.	Paytaqa chayna kananpaqmi ruwarqani.
I want to say thank you again.	Hukmanta gracias niyta munani.
You knew nothing about this a month ago.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas huk killa ñawpaqtaqa yacharqankichu.
They are all very fast and accurate.	Llapallankum ancha utqaylla hinaspa chiqap.
Actually, it was pretty interesting.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Yes, it was that long ago.	Arí, chayna unayñam karqa.
But it takes some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempotan necesitan.
Do that tomorrow night.	Paqarin tuta chayta ruway.
He says he’s not there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kashan nispas nin.
He was surprised and disappointed.	Payqa admirasqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
He would then do it.	Payqa chaymantaqa ruwanman karqan.
Do these things.	Chay ruwaykunata ruway.
If he had left.	Sichus pay ripurqan chayqa.
You really are him.	Chiqaptam pay kanki.
But then, somewhere went wrong.	Ichaqa chaymanta, maypipas mana allinchu karqan.
It’s not this.	Mana kaychu.
I’ve thought that way for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina yuyaykuni.
To learn immediately.	Chaylla yachananpaq.
Otherwise, the process is quite simple.	Mana chayqa, chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
I think maybe he knew.	Yuyaykuni ichapas payqa yacharqa.
Yes, everything is fine.	Arí, tukuy imapas allinmi.
I just kept going.	Ñuqaqa hinallam rirqani.
Everyone knows all of this.	Tukuy chaykunataqa lliwmi yachanku.
I haven’t been there in a long time.	Unayñan mana chaypichu kashani.
He’s a crazy guy.	Payqa loco runam.
What is a new one.	Imataq huk musuq.
Everyone wanted to hear it.	Llapallankum uyariyta munarqa.
Why it’s not difficult.	Imaraykutaq mana sasachu.
Please note that we are not.	Ama hina kaspa, manan chay hinachu kayku.
So, not quite yet.	Chaymi, manaraq allintachu.
This man is no more.	Kay runaqa manañam kanchu.
I just went to it.	Chayllaraqmi rirqani.
He talks about this a lot.	Payqa anchatam kaymanta riman.
Tomorrow is the best for me.	Paqarinmi ñuqapaq aswan allinqa.
How do you mean it? 	¿Imaynatataq niyta munanki?
He hasn’t done it before.	Payqa manan ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanchu.
Not often, you know, but very often.	Mana sapa kutichu, yachanki, ichaqa ancha sapa kuti.
I love to talk.	Rimayta anchata munani.
No, they were the real thing.	Manan, paykunaqa cheqaq kaqmi karqanku.
I want to play that.	Chayta pukllayta munani.
No one seems disappointed.	Manan pipas hukmanyasqa hinachu.
They were great people.	Paykunaqa hatun runakunam karqaku.
And they were glad we did.	Hinaspa kusisqa karqanku chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
One is speed.	Hukninmi utqaylla.
He said he wanted to do that.	Paymi nirqa chayna ruwayta munasqanmanta.
That was a good thing he said.	Chay nisqanqa allinmi karqan.
I’ll be fine here.	Kaypiqa allinmi kasaq.
He wasn't there before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam chaypichu karqa.
However, he did not receive much for this success.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu chaskirqan chay allin ruwasqanmanta.
I know how to tell.	Willayta yachani.
What a lonely hour.	Ima sapallan hora.
The success was remarkable.	Chay allin ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I really do this way.	Chiqaptam kay hinata ruwani.
He doesn’t know where he’s going next.	Payqa manan yachanchu qhepaman mayman rinanpaq.
I think nobody knows for now.	Yuyaykuni kunankamaqa manan pipas yachanchu.
I knew that beforehand.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani.
Does anyone know of a solution?.	¿Pipas huk allichayta yachanchu?.
By doing it again.	Hukmanta ruwaspa.
So it’s always like this.	Chaymi sapa kuti kayna.
But it wasn’t like the old days.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq tiempo hinachu karqan.
It was probably too good.	Yaqapaschá llumpay allin karqa.
He knew he had time.	Payqa yacharqanmi tiempon kashasqanmanta.
But right now, this is really bad.	Ichaqa kunanpacha, kayqa chiqamanta mana allinchu.
Maybe he said he did.	Ichapas chayna ruwasqanmanta nirqa.
I couldn’t eat it.	Manam mikhuyta atirqanichu.
I couldn’t eat anymore.	Manañan mikhuyta atirqanichu.
I hope you never do.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas ruwanaykipaq.
It sounds strange.	Mana riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
Still not that big of a deal.	Hinallam mana chay hatun ruwaychu.
It’s easy to talk.	Rimayqa facilmi.
This is not a complicated process at all.	Kayqa manam huk sasachakuy ruwaychu ni imapipas.
Then you will be very good.	Chaymantaqa ancha allinmi kanki.
But he can’t do it alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwanman.
It makes it better.	Chaytaqa aswan allinta ruwan.
Big problem now for you.	Hatun sasachakuy kunan qampaq.
It’s a very nice thing to do.	Ancha sumaq ruwaymi.
Everything is always a maybe.	Tukuy imapas sapa kutim huk ichapas.
I think it feels better.	Yuyaykuni aswan allinta sientekusqanmanta.
So, that's a problem here, here.	Chaymi, chaymi kaypi, kaypi huk sasachakuy.
Do what you have to do.	Ruway imatachus ruwanayki tiyan.
He wants to hear what he says.	Chay nisqanta uyariyta munan.
What is the right thing to do? 	¿Imata ruwanapaq?
A good boy in school.	Yachay wasipi allin wayna.
That seemed to be some great.	Chayqa wakin hatun hinam karqa.
No one had any idea what would happen next.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu qhepaman imakuna kananta.
He really wanted it to be that way.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina kananta munarqan.
In fact, there’s probably time for that.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chaypaqqa tiempo kan.
I thought he was here.	Kaypi kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I’ll be there all morning.	Tukuy paqarin chaypi kasaq.
It’s not good for you.	Mana allinchu qampaq.
I’m sure it wouldn’t have been easy.	Seguro kani mana facilchu kanman karqan.
But it’s a human being.	Ichaqa huk runa.
Not so much, maybe.	Mana anchatachu, ichapas.
He wanted to do this well.	Payqa allintam kayta ruwayta munarqa.
But here, there was no one.	Ichaqa kaypiqa, manam pipas karqachu.
He is always late, late, late.	Payqa sapa kutim tarde, tarde, tarde.
They are always important.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim importante kanku.
I knew someone was coming.	Yacharqanim pipas hamunanta.
I want you to succeed.	Ñoqaqa munani allinta ruwanaykita.
If he can handle it properly.	Sichus allinta manejayta atinman chayqa.
I don’t know anything about it, really.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu, chiqaptaqa.
I was really devastated.	Chiqamanta sinchi llakisqa tarikurqani.
That seemed like a good thing.	Chayqa allinpaq hinam rikchakurqa.
He realized it wouldn’t work.	Payqa repararqanmi mana allinchu kananta.
And that was the best part.	Hinaspa chaymi aswan allinqa karqa.
He would have angrily refused.	Payqa phiñasqa mana munanmanchu karqan.
You can’t help it anymore.	Manañam yanapayta atiwaqchu.
But it wasn’t really serious.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu serio karqan.
I know too much where you are.	Ñuqaqa anchatam yachani maypi kasqaykita.
The fact that it happened.	Chay pasasqanmanta.
I know a thing or two.	Huk iskay imatapas yachanim.
Can't think of anything, really.	Mana imatapas yuyaymanayta atinchu, chiqaptapuni.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun wayna.
But he may not want to see it.	Ichaqa manapaschá rikuyta munanmanchu.
The current process will be easy.	Kunan ruwayqa facilmi kanqa.
He cannot speak or hear.	Payqa manan rimayta nitaq uyariyta atinchu.
It’s not a good thing.	Manam imapaqpas allinchu.
This was the hardest part of this with him.	Kaymi paywan kaypi aswan sasa karqa.
I’m afraid of failure.	Manchakuni mana allinta ruwayta.
He looked as carefree as ever.	Payqa ñawpaq hinam mana llakisqa rikchakurqa.
I can’t do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I am always very late one day.	Sapa kutim huk punchaw ancha tarde kani.
I didn’t live anywhere else.	Manam maypipas yacharqanichu.
And he's fine.	Hinaspa payqa allinmi kachkan.
Go home, now.	Wasiykiman riy, kunan.
They were all very tough.	Llapallankum ancha sinchi karqaku.
Now he can’t talk.	Kunanqa manaña rimayta atinchu.
It seemed like a big secret.	Chayqa hatun pakasqa hinam karqa.
He tried not to.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi mana chhayna kananpaq.
Unfortunately he is not here.	Llakikuypaqmi mana kaypichu kachkan.
It does a few things.	Iskay kimsa ruwaykunata ruwan.
And if so, I would love to hear about it.	Hinaspa chayna kaptinqa, anchatam munani chaymanta uyariyta.
Something to make things better.	Imapas aswan allinta ruwanapaq.
This is not a good practice.	Kay ruwayqa mana allinchu.
If you know a better way, let me know.	Aswan allin ñanta yachanki chayqa, willaway.
I still do it all the time.	Kunankamapas sapa kutim ruwani.
Don’t know about it.	Ama chaymantaqa yachankichu.
Please forgive me.	Ama hina kaspa, pampachaykuway.
Here it was, now, unsaid.	Kaypim karqa, kunan, mana nisqa.
They were both furious.	Iskayninkum sinchita phiñasqa karqaku.
He didn’t think that was the case.	Payqa manan chhayna kananpaqchu yuyaykurqan.
I could never do it.	Manam haykapipas ruwayta atirqanichu.
He couldn’t see her.	Payqa manan rikuyta atirqanchu.
I can't work like that person.	Manam chay runa hinaqa llamkayta atiymanchu.
You know all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta yachanki.
You've always done it.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
He was truly insane.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin loco kasqa.
The first is speed and simplicity.	Ñawpaq kaqmi usqhaylla ruway, mana sasa ruway ima.
He can’t hear it.	Payqa mana uyariyta atinmanchu.
It happened again, again.	Yapamanta pasarqa, yapamanta.
If not, then no.	Mana kaptinqa, chaymantaqa manam.
Maybe that’s a good thing in that sense.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman chayman hina.
He couldn't stop her anymore.	Manañam harkayta atirqachu.
Maybe you need to do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanayki kanqa.
Most of the time, it was very difficult.	Yaqa llapanpim sinchi sasa karqa.
Can’t afford one.	Mana hukta rantiyta atinchu.
They are so much better than me.	Paykunaqa anchatam ñuqamanta aswan allin kanku.
He does though.	Payqa ruwan ichaqa.
He never said no.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas mana nirqanchu.
They want to walk.	Paykunaqa puriyta munanku.
It looked so safe.	Ancha seguro rikchakurqa.
He is a wonderful teacher.	Payqa sumaq yachachiqmi.
Day two went very well.	Iskay punchawqa ancha allintam rirqa.
There were not many people here.	Kaypiqa manam achka runakunaqa karqachu.
This seems like something he won't talk about.	Kaymi rikchakun mana rimananpaq hina.
I wonder who it is.	Pi kasqanmanta tapukuni.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t always succeed.	Manan imananpaschu mana sapa kutichu allinta ruwanki chayqa.
He drove at night.	Payqa tutan carropi puriq.
Everything seemed so real.	Tukuy imapas ancha chiqap hinam karqa.
I'll go right away.	Chayllam risaq.
As much as he wants to hear.	Uyariyta munasqanman hina.
It seemed unreal.	Mana chiqap hinam karqa.
He would never do that again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
You were willing to do anything.	Tukuy imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi listo karqanki.
He opened it up.	Payqa chayta kicharirqa.
No one seems to know anything about it.	Manapaschá pipas chaymantaqa imatapas yachanchu.
I couldn’t learn his name.	Manam sutinta yachayta atirqanichu.
That’s what he needs.	Chaytan necesitan.
It just didn't make much sense.	Chaylla mana ancha yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
It doesn’t mean he’s serious.	Manam niyta munanchu serio kasqanmanta.
But you were really great.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin hatun karqanki.
They know something is wrong, very, very wrong.	Paykunaqa yachanku imapas mana allin kasqanmanta, ancha, ancha mana allin kasqanmanta.
I hope he would have been proud.	Suyachkani orgulloso kanman karqa.
It does everything it’s supposed to do, it can stop it.	Tukuy ima ruwanan kaqta ruwan, hark’ayta atin.
At least you didn’t.	Aswanpas manan chaytachu ruwarqanki.
Unfortunately there wasn’t.	Llakikuypaqmi mana karqachu.
Three adults, one child.	Kimsa kuraq runakuna, huk wawa.
He asked me if everything was OK.	Paymi tapuwarqa tukuy imapas allinchu icha manachu chayta.
And maybe that’s a good thing.	Hinaspa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
Every person here is like that.	Sapa runa kaypi chayna.
But that negative comment is not true.	Ichaqa chay mana allin rimayqa manan cheqaqchu.
I am really alone.	Chiqaptam sapallay kachkani.
Two hours there.	Iskay hora chaypi.
A couple of things, actually.	Huk iskay imakuna, chiqaptaqa.
I was there for him the whole time too.	Ñoqapas tukuy tiempon paypaq karqani.
He should be the best.	Paymi aswan allinqa kanan.
Tell me you’re ready.	Willaway listoña kasqaykita.
Where is this located.	Maypitaq kayqa kachkan.
He's the best ever.	Payqa aswan allinmi hayk'aqpas.
That wasn’t going to be the only thing.	Chayqa manan chayllachu kanan karqan.
It almost didn't matter.	Yaqa manañam imananpaschu karqa.
But we had to do something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruwanayku karqan.
I am a terrible person.	Ñuqaqa manchay runam kani.
But, no, not really.	Ichaqa, manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
Everything is better and better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinqa aswan allinqa.
I knew you were.	Yacharqanim chayna kasqaykita.
That’s not like him.	Chayqa manan pay hinachu.
He wouldn't do it again.	Payqa manañan hukmanta chayta ruwanqachu karqan.
It’s so important, every day.	Anchatan importante, sapa p’unchay.
They are all excellent.	Llapallankum ancha allin.
These are very simple.	Kaykunaqa ancha facilmi.
I know it is very important.	Yachanim ancha importante kasqanmanta.
Ideally, that would be the case.	Aswan allinqa chayna kanman.
He vehemently disagrees.	Payqa sinchitan mana acuerdopichu kashan.
Meaning he knew he was coming here.	Niyta munan payqa yacharqanmi kayman hamunanta.
He had second thoughts.	Payqa iskay kaq yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
Beautiful month.	Sumaq killa.
The first is for good.	Ñawpaq kaqmi allinpaq.
This is perhaps the best.	Kayqa ichapas aswan allinqa.
He no longer knows who he is.	Manañam yachanchu pi kasqanmanta.
I think it's a really, really big problem.	Chiqap, chiqap hatun sasachakuy kasqanmantam piensani.
Tell the story.	Willayta willay.
Instead, it fails spectacularly.	Aswanpas admirakuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwan.
There will be time for that later.	Chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo kanqa.
He just had to do it.	Payqa chayllaraqmi ruwanan karqa.
I mean, that was part of that.	Niyta munani, chayqa chaymanta hukninmi karqa.
The wicked are like that.	Millay runakunaqa chayna kanku.
And if not, what else.	Hinaspa mana chayqa, imataq kanman.
Prettier, actually.	Aswan sumaq, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe he shouldn't have done that.	Ichapas mana chayta ruwananchu karqa.
Such a move would be foolish.	Chayna ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Beautiful and ugly.	Sumaq hinaspa millay.
They all seem worried.	Llapallankum llakisqa hina kanku.
He was a lonely man.	Payqa sapallanmi puriq.
I don’t think you should be.	Manam yuyanichu chayna kanaykita.
He could not understand this.	Payqa manan kayta entiendeyta atirqanchu.
Now I know the truth now.	Kunanqa kunanmi cheqaq kaqta yachani.
You don’t know how he does it, really.	Mana yachankichu imayna ruwasqanmanta, chiqaptapuni.
He was happy, almost happy.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa, yaqa kusisqa.
It was really tough.	Chiqaptam sinchi karqa.
He really wanted to leave.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ripuyta munarqan.
He was not supposed to be happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kanan karqan.
No no no no no no.	Mana mana mana mana mana mana.
He never said no to anyone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas pimanpas mana nirqanchu.
I never did, you know.	Manam haykapipas ruwarqanichu, yachanki.
That’s the reason why.	Chayqa chayraykum.
Nobody likes it.	Manam pipas gustanchu.
Who is really making money.	Pitaq chiqaptapuni qullqita ruwachkan.
She looks really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
But this is crazy.	Ichaqa kayqa loco.
But it is of no use there.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​chaypiqa.
It's all too long ago.	Tukuy imapas ancha unayñam.
This seems woefully inadequate.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi mana allinchu rikchakun.
It was so nice!.	¡Ancha sumaqmi karqa!.
Insanely well.	Loco hina allinta.
He doesn’t know you’re here.	Payqa manan yachanchu kaypi kasqaykita.
Obviously this makes no sense.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He knew a lot about it.	Payqa anchatam chaymanta yacharqa.
There is no point in repeating that.	Chayta yapamanta rimayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I can be this.	Ñuqaqa kayta atiyman.
He’s not going to be happy about this.	Payqa manan kaymantaqa kusisqachu kanqa.
In fact, you may not be able to buy it.	Aswanpas manapaschá rantiyta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t expect you to be.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna kanaykita.
She’s a girl.	Payqa sipasmi.
He was there three times.	Payqa kimsa kutim chaypi karqa.
One of them is thirty.	Hukninmi kimsa chunka nisqa.
Until now, this was probably not enough.	Kunankamaqa yaqapaschá kayqa mana allinchu karqan.
He knows where you are.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kasqaykita.
But after that.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi.
Thank you thank you thank you!!!!.	Gracias gracias gracias gracias!!!!.
Sad, sad, sad.	Llakisqa, llakisqa, llakisqa.
Here’s the new one.	Kaypi musuq kachkan.
One says one thing, the other says another.	Hukninmi hukta nin, hukninmi hukta nin.
Not sure why this happened.	Mana segurochu imarayku kay pasasqanmanta.
But something will happen.	Ichaqa imapas kanqa.
Something else happened.	Huk imapas pasarqa.
You live here, with me.	Kaypim yachanki, ñuqawan kuska.
He knew he was next.	Payqa yacharqanmi qatiqnin kasqanmanta.
And then that was it.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa chayna karqa.
Do it in a different way.	Huk hina ruway.
I don’t think it was there.	Manam yuyaykunichu chaypi kasqanmanta.
Now things go.	Kunanmi imapas rin.
One last, one last.	Huk qhipa kaq, huk qhipa kaq.
You don’t know what he did to become so rich.	Manan yachankichu imatan ruwarqan chay hina qhapaq kananpaq.
He always knows.	Sapa kutim yachan.
They are extremely beautiful.	Paykunaqa sinchi sumaqmi kanku.
I’m tired too.	Ñoqapas sayk’usqañan kashani.
I want to win this.	Kayta atipayta munani.
Eventually he succeeds.	Qhepamanmi allinta ruwan.
Three days, at most.	Kimsa punchaw, aswan achka.
In something new.	Imapipas musuq kasqanpi.
Maybe it’s there.	Ichapas chaypi kanman.
I was pretty sure.	Allin segurom karqani.
I have to be great.	Hatunmi kanay.
Know what it is you want to do.	Yachay ima ruway munasqayki kasqanmanta.
I was fine with that.	Chaywanqa allintam karqani.
If he can convince her.	Sichus convencechiyta atinman chayqa.
I don't know that to be true.	Chaytaqa manam yachanichu chiqap kananpaq.
And then we did that.	Hinaspa chaymanta chayta ruwarqayku.
But it has to be one or the other.	Ichaqa hukninmi utaq hukninmi kanan.
You,’ he says.	Qamqa,’ nispas nin.
It was a strange thing.	Chayqa mana riqsisqa kaqmi karqa.
Mary’s reaction is severe.	Mariaq ruwasqanqa sinchitan.
Is it right or wrong?.	¿Allinchu icha manachu?.
It won't last very long, at all events.	Mana ancha unaytachu kanqa, tukuy imapipas.
He doesn’t want no one.	Payqa manam mana pitapas munanchu.
I don’t have them yet.	Manaraqmi chaykunataqa kanchu.
But he was very lonely.	Ichaqa sinchitan sapallan kasharqan.
And that’s pretty bad.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
But you weren’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqanki.
But one is more important.	Ichaqa hukninmi aswan allinqa.
Still not sure why this happened.	Manaraqmi segurochu imanasqa chay pasasqanmanta.
Another great meal.	Huk hatun mikhuy.
I know everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata yachani.
I'm glad no one got hurt.	Kusikuni mana pipas k'irisqa kasqanmanta.
You tell me what he did.	Qanmi willaway ima ruwasqanmanta.
In fact, you can’t come.	Aswanpas manan hamuyta atiwaqchu.
Now, that’s amazing.	Kunanqa, chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
The man was really scared.	Chay runaqa cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa kasharqan.
I wonder if he knows how to talk.	Tapukuni sichus rimayta yachanchu.
I have to do it right.	Allinta ruwanay tiyan.
This is what it does.	Kaymi ruwan.
He wanted to do everything.	Payqa tukuy ima ruwaytapas munarqanmi.
He is here alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kaypi kachkan.
That’s a beautiful world.	Chayqa sumaq kay pacha.
Maybe this is you.	Ichapas kayqa qam kanki.
But he must be a good man.	Ichaqa allin runam kanan.
That would have been childish.	Chayqa wawa hina kanman karqan.
He got it right out of him.	Payqa allintam paymanta hurqurqa.
He is, however.	Paymi ichaqa.
Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw kanqa.
He was a man, after all.	Payqa runan karqan, tukuy imamanta.
The result is a very interesting one.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha sumaqmi.
Probably, never ever will be.	Yaqapaschá, mana hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
I couldn’t find a job.	Manam llamkayta tariyta atirqanichu.
He wasn't sure what it was.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imachus kasqanmanta.
He began to understand now.	Payqa kunanmi entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
So he’s just that.	Chaymi payqa chaylla.
It may or may not be important.	Importante kanman manapaschá.
He was stupid and that was that.	Payqa sonso karqan chaymi chay karqan.
I’m sorry.	Llakisqa kani.
She tries to stop him.	Payqa payta hark’ayta munan.
And then, okay .	Hinaspa chaymanta, allinmi .
That was a beautiful girl.	Chayqa sumaq sipasmi kasqa.
He was always like that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
It was supposed to be a new day.	Musuq punchawmi kanan karqa.
Not sure though.	Mana segurochu ichaqa.
Can we be successful.	¿Allin kayta atichwanchu.
I always get someone.	Sapa kutim pitapas hapini.
This is loneliness.	Kayqa sapallan kaymi.
And tonight.	Hinaspa kunan tuta.
But this is actually not correct.	Ichaqa kayqa chiqaptaqa manam allinchu.
Maybe it really was too easy.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni llumpay facil karqa.
It’s cold here.	Kaypiqa chiri kachkan.
It’s safer there.	Chaypin aswan seguro kashan.
It’s amazing how easy it is.	Admirakuypaqmi imayna facil kasqanmanta.
He loves to play.	Payqa anchatam pukllayta munan.
I was truly there for him.	Cheqaqtapunin paypaq chaypi karqani.
I know all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta yachani.
Every girl does that.	Sapa sipasmi chayta ruwan.
Later he said nothing.	Qhepamanmi mana imatapas nirqanchu.
He is truly successful.	Cheqaqtapunin allin ruwaq.
However, it actually greatly speeds up the process.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa anchatam chay ruwayta utqaylla ruwan.
Being on time.	Tiempollanpi kay.
Truth almost never exists.	Cheqaq kaqmi yaqa mana hayk’aqpas kanchu.
Just, you know, do the right thing.	Chaylla, yachanki, allin kaqta ruway.
I never expected that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa suyarqanichu.
Yes, things got better last night.	Arí, qayna tutam imapas aswan allin karqa.
There is an easier way to do this.	Chaypaqqa aswan facil ruwaymi kan.
It’s useless for anything.	Mana imapaqpas allinmi.
Learn another language.	Huk simita yachay.
But you will need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanayki kanqa.
I wanted to see if that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam qawayta munarqani.
Tell me anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas willaway.
But not so much right now.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu kunanpacha.
Not a bad thing.	Mana mana allintachu.
I didn’t do that at all.	Manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu ni imapipas.
I always ask first.	Sapa kutim ñawpaqta tapukuni.
This is something.	Kayqa imapas.
He is like everyone else.	Payqa llapa runakuna hinan chay hinaqa.
This is certainly not easy.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa mana facilchu.
Yes, everything is fine here.	Arí, kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He's obviously wrong.	Payqa sut'inmi pantasqa kashan.
They are well known people.	Paykunaqa allintam riqsisqa runakuna kanku.
Fortunately, there is no one here.	Ancha kusisqa kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.
That was going to be a challenge every week.	Chayqa sapa semanan sasachakuy kanan karqan.
He declined to give his name.	Payqa manan sutinta willayta munarqanchu.
Man, talking to you is great.	Runa, qanwan rimayqa ancha hatunmi.
I always want to be human.	Sapa kutim runa kayta munani.
That’s the only thing that would be good.	Chayllam allin kanman.
That’s where I’m at.	Chayqa chaypim kachkani.
He can talk here or anywhere.	Kaypi utaq maypipas rimayta atin.
Fast and efficient.	Utqaylla hinaspa allinta.
He is a wonderful and talented man.	Payqa ancha sumaq hinaspa yachaysapa runam.
He really likes it, anyway.	Paytaqa anchatam gustan, imayna kaptinpas.
Probably not the first time.	Manapaschá ñawpaq kutichu.
Something has to be right.	Imapas allinmi kanan.
I didn’t know what type it was.	Manam yacharqanichu ima laya kasqanmanta.
Really, really bad stuff.	Chiqap, chiqap mana allin kaq.
There is this great uncertainty now.	Kunanqa kay hatun mana seguro kaymi kachkan.
It was really quite funny.	Chiqaptam ancha asikunapaq karqa.
It’s going to be good you know.	Allinmi kanqa yachanki.
So they are terrified.	Chaymi paykunaqa mancharisqa kachkanku.
Even more impressive are the people themselves.	Aswan admirakuypaqmi kikin runakuna.
It’s good to know about you.	Allinmi qanmanta yachay.
Not' now, anyway.	Mana' kunan, imayna kaptinpas.
But everywhere else they were bigger.	Ichaqa maypipas aswan hatunmi karqanku.
He’s very good at it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypiqa.
Eventually you will find out why.	Qhepamanmi yachanki imarayku chayta.
He pretty much said what he wanted to do.	Payqa yaqapaschá ima ruway munasqantapas nirqan.
What a great thing.	Ima hatunmi.
They were bigger people.	Paykunaqa aswan hatun runakunam karqaku.
Yes, it’s better.	Arí, aswan allinmi.
But that's all in the past.	Ichaqa chayllam ñawpaq tiempopi.
He's never done anything.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas imatapas ruwarqanchu.
Same type of thing.	Kikin laya kaq.
But, you can never tell.	Ichaqa, manan hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
That is the key to success.	Chayqa allin kananpaqmi aswan allinqa.
Unfortunately, he can't.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam atinmanchu.
But he is still in trouble.	Ichaqa hinallam payqa sasachakuypi tarikun.
That’s what I learned.	Chaytan yacharqani.
I'm trying to be real with him.	Paywan chiqap kananpaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
He was intelligent.	Yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
They are not really considered.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu qhawarisqa kanku.
It was like, .	Chayqa karqan hina, .
I mean, it’s a crazy time now.	Niyta munani, kunanqa loco pacha.
I don't think it's true.	Mana chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Maybe it will fail again.	Ichapas hukmanta mana allintachu ruwanman.
And in fact, it continues.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, hinallam kachkan.
He hadn’t been here in a long time.	Unayñan mana kaypichu kasqa.
But no, that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But that didn’t make it untrue.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa mana cheqaqchu karqan.
It looks like that, anyway.	Chayman rikchakun, imayna kaptinpas.
It’s too bad, you can’t.	Llumpay mana allinmi, manam atiwaqchu.
Why is that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna?.
To the school.	Yachay wasiman.
Crazy, actually.	Loco, chiqaptaqa.
He was probably thirty years older.	Payqa yaqapaschá kinsa chunka wata kuraq karqan.
No one has ever been like this with me.	Manan hayk'aqpas pipas kay hinaqa ñoqawanqa karqanchu.
And it looks beautiful.	Hinaspa sumaq rikchayniyuq.
This is huge, man.	Kayqa hatunmi, runa.
So he knew it.	Chaymi payqa yacharqa.
It will never succeed.	Manam haykapipas allintachu ruwanqa.
But one hopes this is not always the case.	Ichaqa huk runaqa suyanmi mana sapa kutichu chayna kananta.
That was about three years ago.	Chayqa karqa yaqa kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
How are you still doing?.	¿Imaynataq kunankamapas kanki?.
And then there’s a little bit.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kanmi huk chikan.
You're not that clever.	Manam chayna allin yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
That means you are.	Chayqa qanmi niyta munan.
It was all true.	Lliwmi chiqap karqa.
So, it was a nice moment.	Chaymi, sumaq rato karqa.
I sure won’t do it.	Seguro mana ruwasaqchu.
Can’t wait to hear from you!.	¡Manan suyayta atiymanchu qanmanta uyariyta!.
Nothing was going to go wrong.	Manam imapas mana allinchu kanan karqa.
Not very good, anyway.	Mana ancha allinchu, imayna kaptinpas.
That would be easy to do.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi kanman.
I wish you were here with me now.	Munaymanmi kunan kaypi ñoqawan kasqaykita.
I know a lot of things.	Achkatam yachani.
And that was it, he never did anything.	Hinaspa chaymi karqan, manan hayk’aqpas imatapas ruwarqanchu.
He seemed more frightened than angry.	Payqa aswan mancharisqa hinan karqan phiñasqa kasqanmantaqa.
It’s always there.	Chaypim sapa kuti kachkan.
And here’s the thing, right .	Hinaspa kaypi kachkan chay imapas, ¿aw .
He was very happy to do so.	Ancha kusisqam chaynata ruwarqa.
I wanted it all along.	Ñoqaqa tukuy tiempon munarqani.
But this can be answered very easily.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha facilmi kutichiyta atinman.
You do everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwanki.
I'll never be able to.	Manam haykapipas atisaqchu.
You can’t go halfway.	Manam kuskan ñanta riyta atiwaqchu.
There will probably be more than one.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta aswan kanqa.
I’ve never heard anything.	Mana hayk’aqpas imatapas uyarirqanichu.
I need the money.	Qullqita necesitasaq.
Just, just .	Chaylla, chaylla .
What he did to her.	Paywan ima ruwasqanmanta.
He would have to do this very quickly.	Payqa kayta ancha utqaylla ruwanan kanman karqa.
The following step is important.	Kay qatiqnin ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
The result was fairly simple.	Chay ruwasqanqa allin facilmi karqa.
That’s because he didn’t do it right.	Chayqa mana allinta ruwasqanmanta.
He wants to do well in school.	Yachay wasipi allinta ruwayta munan.
He was always going to be her.	Payqa sapa kutim pay kanan karqa.
They are irrational.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
But it was worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
And tomorrow was a big day for him, he knew.	Hinaspa paqarin hatun punchaw karqa paypaq, yacharqa.
You’re new in town.	Llaqtapi musuq kanki.
He’s unhappy, very unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu, ancha mana kusisqachu.
But the people were angry.	Ichaqa chay runakunaqa phiñasqa karqanku.
Like the third time.	Kimsa kaq kuti hina.
The youngest of him.	Paymanta aswan sullk’a kaq.
I certainly had to.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanay karqan.
He knew it was important.	Payqa yacharqanmi ancha importante kasqanta.
He wanted a win from her, maybe.	Payqa munarqanmi paymanta huk atipayta, ichapas.
But this he did not do.	Ichaqa kaytan mana ruwarqanchu.
You weren’t not.	Manan manachu karqanki.
People are obviously upset about it.	Runakunaqa sut’inmi chaymanta phiñasqa kashanku.
He knew this was it.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa kasqanmanta.
Not sure if someone else did it or not.	Mana segurochu kanchu huk runa ruwasqanmanta utaq mana.
It’s usually a good thing.	Yaqa llapanpim allin ruway.
I know what it takes to do that.	Yachanim chay ruwanapaq imakuna ruwananta.
He knows what I am like.	Payqa yachanmi imayna kasqayta.
Two or three, yes.	Iskay kimsa, arí.
That’s why he went there.	Chayraykum chayman rirqa.
He doesn’t do anything.	Payqa manam imatapas ruwanchu.
But if you think it’s too much .	Ichaqa sichus yuyaykunki chayqa nishuta .
But no one knows what you’re going to be like.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu imayna kanaykita.
A very nice one.	Ancha sumaq huknin.
Where is the problem or am I doing it wrong.	Maypitaq sasachakuy kachkan icha mana allintachu ruwani.
He knows that is not true.	Payqa yachanmi chay nisqanqa mana cheqaqtachu kasqanmanta.
I have seen that a lot.	Chaytaqa achkatam rikurqani.
There must be someone there.	Chaypi pipas kanan.
If not so stupid.	Mana chayna sonso kaptinqa.
It means no, and yes.	Niyta munan mana, arí ima.
And about him.	Hinaspa paymanta.
I had no idea what to talk to him about.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imamanta paywan rimanaypaq.
These were the first.	Kaykunaqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
Here’s the really hard part.	Kaypi chiqap sinchi kaq.
In fact, it’s faster.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan utqayllam.
Nothing crazy about it.	Mana imapas loco chaymanta.
In this process.	Kay ruwaypi.
But I can't do it.	Ñoqa ichaqa manan atiymanchu.
Unfortunately this is not the best.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa manam aswan allinchu.
Not safe for sure.	Mana segurochu seguro.
People are nice, or not.	Runakunaqa sumaqmi kanku, icha manachu.
Do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchaw ruway.
He knows it’s not true.	Payqa yachanmi mana cheqaq kasqanmanta.
Yes, he was right.	Arí, payqa allintam nirqa.
Instead, say something else.	Aswanpas hukta niy.
It’s like night and day.	Tuta punchaw hinam.
He is probably doing better at home.	Payqa yaqapaschá wasinpi aswan allinta ruwashan.
It was the best thing ever.	Chayqa karqa tukuy imamanta aswan allin kaqmi.
I'm actually really excited.	Chiqaptaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani.
Okay, and don't forget.	Allinmi, hinaspa ama qunqaychu.
He wouldn’t be here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kanman.
Nowhere near crazy.	Mana maypipas loco hinachu.
He could no longer hold a job.	Payqa manañan llank’anata hap’iyta atirqanchu.
That's all that matters now.	Chayllam kunanqa ancha allinqa.
She thought he was serious right away.	Payqa piensaranmi chay rato serio kananpaq.
I kept trying not to talk to him.	Hinallam kallpanchakurqani paywan mana rimanaypaq.
Not much, either.	Mana anchatachu, nitaq.
He seemed drunk.	Payqa machasqa hinam karqa.
If all goes well, you do.	Tukuy imapas allin kaptinqa, chaytam ruwanki.
I wanted to go out again last night.	Qayna tutam yapamanta lluqsiyta munarqani.
It had been a year.	Huk watañam karqa.
He was really good.	Payqa chiqaptam allin karqa.
You stupid boy.	Qan sonso wayna.
No one, ever, had done that to him.	Manan pipas, hayk’aqpas, chaytaqa paytaqa ruwarqanchu.
There he said he had not.	Chaypin nirqan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He hopes to see her again.	Payqa suyanmi hukmanta rikuyta.
All of which he will do.	Tukuy chayta payqa ruwanqa.
But that one time.	Ichaqa chay huk kutilla.
He can’t remember ever wanting something so bad.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atinchu hayk’aqpas chay hina millay imatapas munasqanmanta.
Time, it seemed.	Tiempo, rikchakurqa.
I know that language.	Chay simitaqa yachanin.
It’s not there anymore.	Manam chaypichu kachkan manañam.
What happened to him.	Imataq paywan pasarqa.
That’s what you want to do.	Chayqa munasqayki ruwaymi.
This thing was awkwardly big.	Kay imapas mana allin hatunmi karqa.
You want him, yes.	Payta munanki, arí.
I am really happy now.	Kunanqa chiqap kusisqam kachkani.
This is, this is so great.	Kayqa, kayqa ancha hatunmi.
I saw him a lot.	Paytaqa achkatam rikurqani.
But he doesn’t want to do it.	Ichaqa manan munanchu ruwayta.
Yes, with that.	Arí, chaywan.
I wanted to come before this.	Kaymanta ñawpaqta hamuyta munarqani.
Who was it ?.	¿Pitaq kasqa ?.
I really didn't think about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
This, of course, is not the case.	Kayqa, sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu.
It never seemed to work.	Manam haykapipas allinpaq hinachu karqa.
Better for him there.	Aswan allinmi paypaq chaypi.
I couldn’t get ahold of anything.	Manam imamantapas hapiyta atirqanichu.
Maybe he’s guilty.	Ichapas payqa huchayoq kanman.
They are not good enough.	Paykunaqa manam allinchu kanku.
Maybe something will work out.	Ichapas imapas allin kanman.
I was very surprised that it would happen.	Anchatam admirakurqani chayna kananmanta.
He is such a man.	Payqa chayna runam.
It’s been here all week.	Tukuy semana kaypi kachkan.
So many things.	Chaymi achka imakuna.
You’re a good guy.	Qam allin runa.
I thought it was always going to happen.	Yuyarqanim sapa kuti chayna kananta.
Everyone knows where he is now.	Lliwmi yachanku kunan maypi kasqanmanta.
He's a little like that.	Payqa huk chikan chayna kachkan.
To the new house.	Musuq wasiman.
As real as anything.	Imapas hina chiqap kaq.
Who knew what was out there.	Pitaq yacharqa imakuna hawapi kasqanmanta.
Everyone is great and everything is great.	Tukuy runa hatunmi tukuy imapas hatunmi.
I know he hoped for something better.	Yachanim imapas aswan allin suyakusqanmanta.
But it doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas allinchu.
In fact, he had no choice.	Chiqaptaqa, manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu chayta ruwayta.
But they are not the only ones.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kanku.
This was the most common.	Kaymi aswan achka karqa.
Then he was expelled.	Chaymanta qarqosqa karqan.
There is nothing we can do here.	Kaypiqa manam ima ruwaytapas atichwanchu.
It’s really, really awesome.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta manchay.
This is about right.	Kayqa yaqa allinmi.
I never know when and why.	Manam haykapipas yachanichu haykapi hinaspa imanasqa.
But unfortunately.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi.
But he would never have done that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
He didn’t feel comfortable that day.	Chay punchawqa manam allinchu tarikurqa.
Maybe there isn't.	Icha kanchu.
Just tell me how it feels.	Chaylla imayna sientekusqanmanta willaway.
But this is a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi.
He refused to talk to her, to see her.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan rimayta, payta rikuyta.
Every day, you know.	Sapa punchawmi, yachanki.
That guy is crazy .	Chay runaqa loco .
Obviously there’s a problem here.	Sut’inmi kaypi sasachakuy kashan.
However, there is no reason.	Ichaqa, manan imaraykupas kanchu.
Unfortunately, that is not a good thing.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa manam allinchu.
In fact, it’s the newest.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan musuq kaqmi.
Both were expelled.	Iskayninkum qarqusqa karqaku.
I wanted to see him every day.	Sapa punchawmi payta qawayta munarqani.
Things worked out with that.	Chaywanmi imapas allin karqa.
Nothing ever exists.	Manam imapas haykapipas kanchu.
It just won’t be good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu kanqa.
Much more than that.	Aswan achka chaymanta.
If it does that.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa.
If it’s the right one.	Allin kaq kaptinqa.
He wanted what he wanted.	Payqa munarqanmi munasqanta.
That was never going to be easy.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas facilchu kanan karqan.
I couldn’t get out.	Manam lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
And really good at that.	Hinaspa chiqap allin chaypi.
Yes, he was angry.	Arí, payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
Yeah, there's really nothing to it.	Arí, chiqaptaqa manam imapas chaypiqa kanchu.
Do that now.	Chaytaqa kunan ruway.
I have a much better idea now.	Kunanqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
Please let me know what you think about it.	Ama hina kaspa, chaymanta ima yuyaykusqaykita willaway.
He seems to be hungry all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempo yarqasqa hinam kachkan.
Will it be a good idea?.	¿Allinchu kanqa?.
It’s faster.	Aswan utqayllam.
This was supposed to be too easy.	Kayqa llumpay facilmi kanan karqa.
There you will be happy.	Chaypin kusisqa kanki.
You make the announcement.	Qanmi chay willakuyta ruwanki.
It was always you.	Sapa kutim qam karqanki.
Now I want him here.	Kunanqa kaypi payta munani.
You can't stop it outside.	Manan hawapi hark'ayta atiwaqchu.
That’s the easiest thing to do.	Chayqa aswan facil ruwaymi.
That one person is you.	Chay huk runaqa qanmi kanki.
Faster and better.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan allinmi.
He knew how to get a win.	Payqa yacharqanmi imaynatas huk atipayta tariyta.
Not like him at all.	Mana pay hinachu ni imapipas.
You just did it right away.	Chayllaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
But it’s not really funny.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu asikunapaq hina.
If you do, then it would be good.	Sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa, chaymantaqa allinmi kanman.
But that was just in the past.	Ichaqa chayllam ñawpaq tiempopi karqa.
The process went well.	Chay ruwayqa allintam rirqa.
Of course, he knew he wasn't alone.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi mana sapallan kasqanmanta.
But the evil was wrong.	Ichaqa chay millay ruwaymi mana allinchu karqan.
I can’t think of anything else.	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
The man was mine.	Runaqa ñuqapa karqa.
Unfortunately it really isn’t.	Llakikuypaqmi cheqaqtapuni manachu.
That was the only thing that mattered.	Chayllam aswan allinqa karqa.
He was the most recent.	Payqa aswan qhepa kaqmi karqan.
And you look beautiful.	Hinaspa sumaq rikchayniyuq kanki.
I want to travel more.	Astawan puriyta munani.
Everyone was on bikes.	Lliwmi bicicletapi karqaku.
It will probably fail.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu ruwanqa.
He was the nicest thing.	Payqa aswan sumaq kaqmi karqan.
In fact, they’re the worst.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa aswan mana allinmi kanku.
Nothing like that will happen.	Manam imapas chayna kaptinqa kanqachu.
But it’s okay if you want to.	Ichaqa munaspaqa allinmi.
He couldn't get it right again.	Manas yapamanta allinta hapiyta atirqachu.
There are some bad guys out there.	Chaypiqa kanmi wakin mana allin runakuna.
So with that, there you go.	Chaymi chaywanqa, chaypi rinki.
He knows how to play very well.	Payqa ancha allintam pukllayta yachan.
We did really well that night.	Chay tutaqa ancha allintam ruwarqayku.
First of all, for me.	Ñawpaqtaqa ñuqapaq.
Several days ago.	Achka punchaw ñawpaqta.
But it is no longer true.	Ichaqa manañan cheqaqchu.
I think I won’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwanaypaqmi yuyaykuni.
He can be alone all day.	Tukuy punchawmi sapallan kanman.
They were always two.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim iskay karqaku.
And that actually makes more sense.	Hinaspa chaymi chiqaptaqa aswan yuyayniyuq.
And do it quickly.	Hinaspa usqhaylla ruway.
It should be there immediately.	Chayllam chaypi kanan.
It was actually a beautiful night.	Chiqaptaqa sumaq tutam karqa.
I didn’t see him coming back.	Manam kutimunanta rikurqanichu.
It just couldn't be true.	Chaylla mana chiqap kayta atirqachu.
Maybe it was something else.	Ichapas huk imapas karqa.
And you’re evil.	Hinaspa millay kanki.
I think you agree with that.	Chaywanqa acuerdopi kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
It should be bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kanan.
They were like this.	Kay hinam karqaku.
She refused and tried to drive away.	Payqa manan munarqanchu, chaymi carronta ripuyta munarqan.
We’ve always done that.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ruwarqayku.
Nice thing about you.	Sumaq imapas qammanta.
He has a set mind.	Payqa huk churasqa yuyayniyuqmi.
You probably always want some money.	Yaqapaschá sapa kutilla wakin qolqeta munanki.
More challenging to do what you want.	Aswan sasachakuy munasqaykita ruwanaykipaq.
And so now, here it is.	Hinaspa chayna kunan, kaypi kachkan.
I think it will be good.	Allinmi kanqa nispaymi piensani.
He sounds ridiculous.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
Maybe it’s okay.	Ichapas allinmi kachkan.
It was pretty good, actually.	Allin allinmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
It can be more frequent or more severe.	Aswan sapa kuti utaq aswan sinchi kanman.
It wouldn’t have been difficult.	Manam sasachu kanman karqa.
This continues throughout the night.	Chayqa tukuy tutam hinallam kachkan.
However, this practice is rapidly being discredited.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa usqhayllan mana allinpaq qhawarisqa kashan.
Anything would be better than that.	Imapas chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He kept coming.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi hamuq.
Not sure what to say about that.	Mana segurochu chaymanta ima niyta.
I don’t want to think about it anymore.	Manañam chaypi yuyaymanayta munanichu.
He was, maybe that morning.	Payqa karqan, ichapas chay paqarin.
I really hope someone can help.	Chiqamanta suyachkani pipas yanapananta.
He is clearly in trouble.	Sut’inmi kashan sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
Everything is fine with me.	Tukuy imapas allinmi ñuqawan.
Maybe I’m too skeptical.	Ichapas llumpayta iskayrayani.
There was almost nothing there.	Chaypiqa yaqa mana imapas karqachu.
A year, maybe.	Huk wata, ichapas.
No one needed this at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan pipas kayta necesitarqanchu.
Went well for me.	Rirqa allinta ñuqapaq.
I hope he knows that.	Chayta yachananta suyachkani.
And that’s a very sad fact.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi chiqap.
He loved to think.	Payqa anchatam munarqa yuyaymanayta.
This was absurd.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
This is obviously a big problem.	Kayqa sut’inmi hatun sasachakuy.
I am fine now.	Kunanqa allintam kachkani.
Foolishness could not believe it.	Mana yuyayniyuq kayqa manam creeyta atirqachu.
It’s all there.	Tukuy chaypi kachkan.
That’s pretty absurd.	Chayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
And all those important people were very smart.	Hinaspa chay llapa importante runakunaqa ancha yachaysapa karqanku.
Crazy, I’m angry.	Loco, phiñasqa kani.
You are always with me in the truth.	Cheqaq kaypi tukuy tiempon ñoqawan kashanki.
Good maybe, but certainly not the best.	Allin ichapas, ichaqa seguro mana aswan allinchu.
I'm afraid of getting caught.	Manchakuni hapisqa kayta.
It was actually very good.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He sounds very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam uyarikun.
He’s a very talented player.	Payqa ancha yachaysapa pukllaqmi.
He did not know what language they were in.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima simipi kasqankuta.
Crazy, crazy time.	Loco, loco pacha.
He had to be drunk.	Payqa machasqa kanan karqan.
Maybe every week one is more realistic for you.	Ichapas sapa semana huk aswan chiqap kanman qampaq.
Beautiful, isn’t it ?.	Sumaq, ¿manachu ?.
No matter how unpleasant it is.	Imayna mana sumaq kaptinpas.
He said it was worse than he expected.	Payqa nirqam suyasqanmanta aswan mana allin kasqanmanta.
It went over so well.	Chayna allintam pasarqa.
It’s all you.	Tukuy qanmi kanki.
He wanted to ask her.	Payta tapuyta munarqa.
Hopefully that will happen now.	Munaymanmi kunan chayna kananta.
There is nothing else like it!.	¡Manan imapas huk hinaqa kanchu!.
But he didn't know that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa manan yacharqanchu.
I'm actually not happy about this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kusisqachu kani kaymanta.
That’s really amazing.	Chayqa chiqap admirakuypaqmi.
What a good idea you have.	Ima allin yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I listened anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas uyarirqanim.
I’m out of here!.	¡Kaymanta hawapi kachkani!.
Of course, no one was there.	Arí, manam pipas chaypiqa karqachu.
I mean crazy.	Loco niyta munani.
Fortunately, the process is easy.	Ancha kusisqa, chay ruwayqa facilmi.
I'm trying anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas kallpanchakuchkani.
This time for good, again.	Kay kutipi allinpaq, yapamanta.
I'm glad that's the case.	Kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
So I do everything.	Chaymi tukuy imatapas ruwani.
To my house.	Wasiyman.
It should be a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi kanan.
I can’t keep up with you.	Manam qanwan kuska puriyta atiymanchu.
There is a better way to do it.	Aswan allin ruwaymi kan.
There will be a day.	Huk punchawmi kanqa.
Now there was something else.	Kunanqa huk kaqmi karqa.
It’s still there.	Hinallam chaypi kachkan.
Great head.	Hatun uma.
I mean, maybe it is.	Niyta munani, ichapas chayna kanman.
He wanted everything to work out for him.	Payqa munarqanmi tukuy imapas paypaq allin kananta.
You can never do that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Be a good person first.	Ñawpaqtaqa allin runa kay.
The first is the first.	Ñawpaq kaqmi ñawpaq kaq.
It was a bad day.	Mana allin punchawmi karqa.
And then one day he was gone.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk punchaw manaña karqachu.
Twenty, thirty years.	Iskay chunka, kimsa chunka wata.
He looked sad and worried.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa qhawarisqa.
I don’t agree at all.	Manam ni imapipas acuerdopichu kani.
Do what you need to do to succeed.	Chay ruwaypi allinta ruwanaykipaq imatachus ruwanaykita ruway.
Therefore , the	Chaymi chay .
This was adulthood.	Kayqa karqan kuraq runa kaymi.
It went on all night.	Tukuy tutam pasarqa.
Of this he is rather certain.	Kaymantaqa payqa aswan segurom kachkan.
Yes, very sad.	Arí, ancha llakisqa.
He is the second worst character.	Paymi iskay kaq aswan millay runa.
I can’t remember everything.	Manam tukuyta yuyariyta atinichu.
Less than two weeks later, he did.	Manaraq iskay semana qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
This is actually a good thing to do.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allin ruwaymi.
And that’s what he did.	Hinaspa chaytam ruwarqa.
He's actually doing better.	Payqa chiqaptaqa aswan allintam ruwachkan.
In fact, he's a little crazy.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa huk chikan loco hinam kachkan.
Be assured that it is not.	Seguro kay mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But then he spent a lot of time outdoors.	Ichaqa chaymantam achka tiempota hawapi pasarqa.
He said it really was.	Paymi nirqa chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
It wasn’t like home.	Manam wasi hinachu karqa.
He was never happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kusisqachu karqan.
It doesn't look like it should be this difficult.	Manam kayna sasa kanan hinachu rikchakun.
Yes, he does that.	Arí, payqa chaytan ruwan.
Yeah, it’s that simple.	Arí, chayna facilmi.
I know I really do.	Yachanim ñuqaqa chiqaptam ruwani.
It was very very good.	Ancha ancha allinmi karqa.
That was last night.	Chayqa qayna tutam.
So it is not very good to talk immediately.	Chaymi chaylla rimayqa mana ancha allinchu.
I think it’s going to be good.	Allinmi kananta yuyani.
So that’s what I was there for.	Chaymi chaymi ñoqa chaypi karqani.
He said he shouldn't.	Payqa manam ruwananchu nispam nirqa.
I’m sure that would work.	Seguro kani chaywanqa allin kanman.
Make a good meal.	Allin mikhunata ruway.
He is the one who is doing this.	Paymi kayta ruwachkan.
This was the third year in a row.	Kayqa kimsa kaq watañam karqa.
Maybe not anymore.	Ichapas manaña.
Someone started singing.	Pipas takiyta qallaykurqa.
You couldn't have said that a year ago.	Huk wata ñawpaqtaqa manam chaytaqa niyta atiwaqchu.
But nothing is true.	Ichaqa manan imapas cheqaqchu.
So it was good to be fired.	Chaymi qarqusqa kayqa allin karqa.
I still refused.	Hinallam mana munarqanichu.
Either you want it or you don’t.	Icha munanki utaq mana munankichu.
But I’m not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani.
Who knows how we did it.	Pi yachan imayna ruwasqaykumanta.
Instead, it means this.	Aswanpas kaytan niyta munan.
They were adults.	Paykunaqa kuraq runakunam karqaku.
Together with you.	Qamwan kuska.
I hear a lot of it.	Achkatam uyarini.
This was rather interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
I feel overwhelmed.	Llumpay llakisqa hinam tarikuni.
But at the time, they seemed wrong.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa pantasqa hinan karqanku.
I still feel so funny about my relationship with him.	Kunankamapas ancha asikunapaq hinam tarikuni paywan imayna kasqaymanta.
Proud to be there.	Orgulloso chaypi kasqaymanta.
Yes, this really happened.	Arí, kayqa chiqaptam pasarqa.
That's like half the problem.	Chayqa kuskan sasachakuy hinam.
I thought that was you.	Chayqa qanmi kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
It went very fast.	Ancha utqayllam rirqa.
It was a ridiculous thing to do.	Chayqa asikunapaq hina ruwaymi karqa.
In fact, several times.	Chiqaptaqa, achka kutita.
I can't find any information.	Mana ima willayta tarinichu.
He did well in it.	Payqa allintan chaypi ruwarqan.
They obviously know it hasn’t happened yet.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi yachanku manaraq chay pasasqanmanta.
I don’t know any more to tell you.	Manam astawan willanaypaq yachanichu.
I think so, anyway.	Chaynatam piensani, imayna kaptinpas.
It’s still stupid.	Hinallam sonso kachkan.
So they are not very good.	Chaymi paykunaqa mana ancha allinchu kanku.
Maybe it’s me.	Ichapas ñuqa kani.
Everything I’ve done.	Tukuy ima ruwasqaymanta.
But he was neither here nor there at the time.	Ichaqa manan chay tiempopiqa kaypichu nitaq chaypichu karqan.
He is quite happy.	Payqa allintan kusisqa kashan.
He didn't seem right.	Payqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
He said it would never happen.	Paymi nirqa mana haykapipas chayna kananmanta.
I couldn’t say what it was.	Manam niyta atirqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
Every night he was gone.	Sapa tutan manaña karqanchu.
But you have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwanayki.
But he didn't need this now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa kayta necesitarqanchu.
He sounds like a disappointed kid.	Payqa hukmanyasqa wawa hinam uyarikun.
It’s almost not worth it.	Yaqa mana valenchu.
It really is all about you.	Cheqaqtapunin qanmanta tukuy imapas.
But no one wants to hear that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaykunataqa uyariyta munanchu.
Now, there is no one.	Kunanqa, manam pipas kanchu.
Another drunken night.	Huk machasqa tuta.
Here we are, now.	Kaypim kachkaniku, kunanqa.
This process takes time.	Chay ruwayqa tiempotan necesitan.
He never thought it would be like this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu kay hina kananta.
I was always on the outside.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim aswan hawapi karqani.
Instead, he felt frustrated and sad.	Aswanpas hukmanyasqa hinaspa llakisqa tarikurqa.
In other words, he did.	Huk nisqanman hinaqa, chaytam ruwarqa.
I will do this as I do.	Kaytaqa ñuqa hinam ruwasaq.
It was something beyond that.	Chayqa karqan imapas chaymanta aswan hatunmi.
Here, this how you do that.	Kaypi, kay imaynata chayta ruwanki.
Okay, so tell me.	Allinmi, chaymi willaway.
It’s amazing, right.	Admirakuypaqmi, ¿aw.
He could be here tomorrow.	Payqa paqarinmi kaypi kanman.
Then I had nowhere else to go.	Chaymantaqa manañam maymanpas rinaypaq karqachu.
And that’s what this is all about.	Hinaspa chaymi kay tukuy imamanta.
Actually, this is pretty simple.	Chiqaptaqa, kayqa ancha facilmi.
Then there is another thing.	Chaymantaqa huk kaqmi kachkan.
Maybe they’re smart.	Ichapas paykunaqa yachaysapa kanku.
If someone wants to do something on their own, that’s fine.	Sichus pipas sapallan imatapas ruwayta munan chayqa, allinmi.
I like it quickly.	Utqaylla gustan.
Even if it’s not cold outside.	Mana hawapi chiri kaptinpas.
Not anymore, anyway.	Manaña, imayna kaptinpas.
I think most people know this.	Yuyaykuni yaqa llapan runakuna kayta yachanku.
He knew immediately that it was too easy.	Payqa chayllam yacharqa chay ruwayqa llumpay facil kasqanmanta.
This would be the time to do that.	Kaymi chayta ruwanapaq tiempo kanman.
I want to be alone.	Sapallan kaytam munani.
He knew what it would be like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kananta.
No one should be ready for that.	Manan pipas chaypaqqa listochu kanan.
I’m not going to do that.	Manam chaynataqa ruwasaqchu.
This is a two-step process.	Kayqa iskay ruwaykunata ruwana.
No one really knew that.	Chaytaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yacharqan.
It was obvious that it wasn’t right.	Sut’inmi karqan mana allinchu kashasqanmanta.
And that’s what he wanted.	Hinaspa chaytan payqa munarqan.
I went with it.	Chaywanmi rirqani.
He should have done that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanan karqa.
This was the hardest for me.	Kaymi aswan sasa ñuqapaq karqa.
Things should be interesting here.	Kaypiqa imapas sumaqmi kanan.
That was something amazing.	Chayqa imapas admirakuypaqmi karqa.
And, maybe, a little scared.	Hinaspa, ichapas, huk chikan mancharisqa.
This has always been the case.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
It just makes no sense.	Chaylla mana imapaqpas valenchu.
It hasn’t been like that for a long time.	Unayñan mana chay hinachu.
Most of them were not busy.	Yaqa llapallankum mana ocupasqa karqaku.
It really makes sense.	Chiqamanta yuyayniyuq.
It seems absurd.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi rikchakun.
We did him two weeks ago.	Iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi paytaqa ruwarqayku.
Be yourself anywhere, everywhere, in everything and everything.	Maypipas, maypipas, tukuy imapipas imapipas qampaq kay.
No thanks to him.	Mana gracias paymanta.
Either that, or he doesn’t exist.	Icha chay, icha payqa mana kanchu.
So people are constant.	Chaymi runakunaqa sapa kutilla kanku.
He was much easier than that.	Payqa chaymantaqa aswan facilmi karqa.
This thing here.	Kay imapas kaypi.
I am truly sorry for you.	Cheqaqtapunin qanmanta llakikuni.
You are no longer a bad person.	Manañam millay runachu kanki.
Maybe you can’t see it.	Ichapas mana qawayta atiwaqchu.
That was all there was now.	Chayllam kunanqa karqa.
But that’s the other one.	Ichaqa chay huknin kaq.
Now he was the one.	Kunanqa payqa karqan.
This process does.	Kay ruwayqa ruwan.
Probably better late at night.	Yaqapaschá tarde tutamanta aswan allin kanman.
Everyone wants to be safe.	Lliwmi munanku seguro kayta.
Now, he wasn’t so sure.	Kunanqa, manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.
But I can’t grasp how to fix it.	Ichaqa manan hap’iyta atiymanchu imayna allichayta.
I just can’t get over it.	Chaylla mana atipayta atiymanchu.
I’m not the only one.	Ñuqaqa manam chayllachu kani.
I don’t want to hear anything.	Manam munanichu imatapas uyariyta.
Tomorrow is a day.	Paqarin huk punchaw.
Yes, that was about two years ago.	Arí, chayqa yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I can't find a way to do it.	Manam tarinichu imayna ruwanaypaq.
Maybe it won’t last long.	Ichapas mana unaytachu kanman.
Then he’s the one.	Chaymantam payqa.
This is very, very difficult.	Kayqa ancha, ancha sasam.
I knew anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas yacharqanim.
But then that’s it.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chay.
Everything you have to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanayki tiyan.
Other than that, it could have been anyone.	Mana chaymantaqa, pipas kanman karqan.
I hear the walking.	Puriyta uyarini.
You, not like that.	Qam, mana chaynatachu.
He’s so ridiculously good.	Payqa ancha asikunapaq hina allinmi.
Not always, at least.	Mana sapa kutichu, aswanpas.
I want him to succeed.	Munani allinta ruwananta.
I thought I wouldn’t.	Mana nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
He seemed to be in good spirits.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
He wants to do better.	Aswan allin ruwaymi munan.
Anyone could have done that.	Pipas chaynatam ruwanman karqa.
Later that year, he didn’t.	Chay wata qhepamanmi mana.
That was him now, that was him now for sure.	Chayqa paymi karqan kunan, chaymi pay karqan kunan seguro.
That was supposed to be him.	Chayqa paymi kanan karqa.
You can't, anyway.	Manam atiwaqchu, imayna kaptinpas.
Like a human being.	Huk runa hina.
He does it to the best of his ability.	Chaytaqa atisqanman hinan ruwan.
There is the same ???.	Chaypi kikin ???.
This is how it will be.	Kay hinam kanqa.
He knew the language better.	Payqa aswan allintan yacharqan chay simita.
So we can have no idea about that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa mana ima yuyayniyuq kayta atichwanchu.
I think he knows better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinta yachan, nispan yuyaykuni.
There was something better than being alone.	Sapallan kaymantaqa imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
He knew exactly where he was.	Payqa allintam yacharqa maypi kasqanmanta.
But now, who knows.	Ichaqa kunan, ¿pitaq yachan.
Then next week.	Chaymanta hamuq semana.
I'm afraid I won't.	Manchakuni mana.
Not really a big deal.	Mana chiqap hatun ruwaychu.
He's something else, that one.	Payqa huk imapas, chay hukninmi.
A quick one.	Huk utqaylla.
Everyone wants it all.	Lliwmi tukuy chayta munanku.
It is not easy or worthwhile anyway.	Mana facilchu nitaq valenchu ​​imayna kaptinpas.
All day, all night.	Tukuy punchaw, tukuy tuta.
I want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munani.
Yes, right now.	Arí, kunanpacha.
Not easy to do, for sure.	Mana facilchu ruway, seguro.
But if I probably don’t, I’ll do this.	Ichaqa manapaschá chayta ruwasaqchu chayqa, kayta ruwasaq.
You just knew you were in trouble.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqanki sasachakuypi kasqaykita.
It was a tough day.	Chay punchawqa sinchi sasa punchawmi karqa.
Of course, there wasn’t.	Chiqamanta, manas karqachu.
It was actually much bigger than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi karqa.
But that’s not all yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chayllachu.
And it's out there.	Hinaspa chay hawapi kachkan.
But it’s probably true.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá cheqaq.
I’m quick, you know.	Utqayllam kani, yachanki.
It was a little lonely.	Chayqa huk chikan sapallanmi karqa.
Do everything that no one else has to do.	Tukuy imata ruway, mana pipas ruwanan kaqta.
It doesn't really mean.	Mana chiqaptapuni niyta munan.
Every day of the week there is something new to do.	Semanapi sapa punchawmi imapas musuq ruwanapaq kachkan.
But we are happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kanchik.
He is here at home now.	Payqa kunanmi kaypi wasipi kachkan.
I don't care about that either.	Ñuqapas manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
The man is so, very busy.	Chay runaqa chhayna, ancha ocupasqa.
Three times a fool.	Kimsa kutita huk sonso.
No one knows who they are.	Manan pipas yachanchu pikuna kasqankuta.
Nothing was that simple.	Manam imapas chayna facilchu karqa.
How was it going to be.	Imaynataq karqa.
This was very very easy.	Kayqa ancha ancha facilmi karqa.
She would have preferred to be alone with him.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan paywan sapallan kayta.
And then go to a party.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk fiestaman riy.
But yeah, it’s crazy.	Ichaqa arí, loco.
I’m going to know.	Ñuqa yachanki.
It wasn’t easy at all.	Manam ni imapipas facilchu karqa.
I need to do this again very, very soon.	Kaytaqa ancha, ancha utqayllam yapamanta ruwanay.
Perhaps, too difficult.	Ichapas, ancha sasa.
Two, three years ago.	Iskay, kimsa wata ñawpaq.
But then they were smart about it.	Ichaqa chaymantam chaymanta yachaysapa karqaku.
He was serious though.	Payqa ichaqa serio karqan.
It would be foolish to be offended by it.	Chaywan phiñasqa kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
I probably can’t find it.	Manapaschá tarinichu.
This would be great if you wanted to.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman munaspaqa.
That is not a good thing.	Chay nisqanqa manam allinchu.
You know, if he did that.	Yachanki, sichus pay chayta ruwarqan chayqa.
He’s almost.	Payqa yaqa.
And they want to talk about this.	Hinaspa kaymanta rimayta munanku.
Maybe he'll never be ready.	Ichapas mana haykapipas listochu kanman.
If not one year, ten years.	Mana huk wata kaptinqa, chunka wata.
So he should know.	Chaymi payqa yachananta.
But, yeah, maybe.	Ichaqa, arí, ichapas.
He still does that today.	Kunankamapas chaytam ruwan.
One was tired of everything, and so it was.	Hukninmi tukuy imamanta sayk’usqa karqan, hinan karqan.
And again nothing.	Hinaspa yapamanta mana imapas.
They are good people.	Allin runakunam.
He realized that.	Payqa chayta repararqanmi.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kananmanta.
There is a beauty here.	Kaypiqa kanmi huk sumaq kay.
He didn’t want to do her in a hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu payta ruwayta munarqan.
That’s the uncertainty.	Chayqa mana seguro kaymi.
It will certainly be better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allin kanqa.
I have no idea how to be in that world.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna chay pachapi kanaypaq.
In your opinion.	¿Qanpa yuyayniykipiqa.
He had an idea now.	Payqa kunanmi huk yuyayniyuq karqan.
And he with her, at the time.	Hinaspa payqa paywan kuska, chay tiempopi.
They were really excited.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam kusisqa karqaku.
I didn't do that here.	Kaypiqa manam chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
A first, really.	Huk ñawpaq, chiqap.
Everything would go wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu puriq.
Hopefully he will do better.	Munaymanmi aswan allinta ruwananpaq.
That would mean this.	Chayqa kaymi niyta munanman.
That made it better.	Chayqa aswan allintam ruwarqa.
I thought you were a nice person.	Sumaq runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I feel really good actually.	Chiqaptam allinta sientekuni chiqaptaqa.
Then he will come here.	Chaymantaqa kayman hamunqa.
Then he will go.	Chaymantaqa rinqa.
You were so good at it.	Chayna allintam chaypiqa karqanki.
Outside.	Hawapi.
I’m not sure when a better night would be.	Manam segurochu kani haykapi aswan allin tuta kanman.
He was not a stupid man.	Payqa manam sonso runachu karqa.
He wasn’t a nice guy.	Payqa manam sumaq runachu karqa.
Yes, you do.	Arí, qamqa ruwanki.
This is pretty ridiculous.	Kayqa ancha asikunapaq hinam.
I don’t disagree at all.	Manam imapipas mana acuerdopichu kani.
And that was a big one.	Hinaspa chayqa hatunmi karqa.
He’s probably a guy.	Payqa yaqapaschá huk wayna kanman.
You can’t predict that.	Manan chaytaqa willayta atiwaqchu.
He seemed very, very happy.	Payqa ancha, ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
There he wanted her.	Chaypin payqa payta munarqan.
I’m sure it’s going to be great.	Seguro kani ancha hatun kananmanta.
Very, very impressed.	Ancha, ancha admirasqa.
Would it be here.	¿Kaypichu kanman.
But the harsh reality was that this was not the case.	Ichaqa chay sinchi cheqaq kaqmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
He told me not to do it.	Niwarqa ama ruwanaypaq.
He couldn't remember what it looked like.	Manas yuyariyta atirqachu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
What went wrong.	Imataq mana allintachu rirqa.
I’m drunk, boy.	Machasqa kani, wayna.
His good point was very clear.	Allin nisqanqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
It’s a very difficult thing to do.	Ancha sasa ruway.
Tell them what will happen.	Imakuna pasananta niy.
What was the solution? 	¿Imatataq ruwana karqa?
I don't remember this.	Kaymantaqa manam yuyarinichu.
He tried not to.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi mana chayta ruwananpaq.
He said he was right.	Payqa allintam chayta ruwasqanqa nirqa.
I'm more certain about it.	Aswan segurom kani chaymanta.
He certainly didn’t say that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu nisqa.
But he refused to listen.	Ichaqa manañan uyariyta munarqanchu.
A really good one.	Chiqap allin kaq.
But there was nothing he could do now.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu kunanqa.
I meant nice.	Sumaqmi niyta munarqani.
I couldn’t see it anywhere.	Manam maypipas rikuyta atirqanichu.
One of the .	Hukninmi chay .
He wished it had never been his.	Payqa munarqanmi mana hayk’aqpas paypaq kananta.
I was the third one.	Ñuqaqa kimsa kaqmi karqani.
He looked back in anger.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa qhepaman qhawarirqan.
No one can make this movie.	Mana pipas kay peliculata ruwayta atinmanchu.
If not, soon enough.	Mana chayqa, pisi tiempollamantan.
You did everything right, first.	Tukuy allintam ruwarqanki, ñawpaqtaqa.
I can’t wait to go.	Manam suyayta atinichu rinaypaq.
He has to do what he wants.	Payqa munasqanman hinan imatapas ruwanan.
He probably did just that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqa.
Indeed, he still is.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa kunankamapas kashan.
It’s very, very nice.	Ancha ancha sumaqmi.
You're not sure anymore.	Manañam segurochu kanki.
I don’t know him, actually.	Manam paytaqa riqsinichu, chiqaptaqa.
I want everything that is mine.	Tukuy imatam ñuqapa kaqta munani.
You know very well that it is not.	Allintam yachanki mana chayna kasqanmanta.
There’s really awesome stuff out there.	Chiqamanta manchay imakuna kan chay hawapi.
He knows what is coming.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna hamunanta.
So, it’s pretty bad.	Chaymi, ancha millay.
This is the really hard time.	Kaymi chiqap sasa pacha.
It allowed him to be human.	Chayqa runa kananpaqmi saqirqa.
No one was happy about it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa kusisqachu tarikurqa.
Nothing about me.	Mana imapas ñuqamanta.
A wise man.	Yachaysapa runa.
He wants to find her.	Payta tariyta munan.
This is the highest form of humanity.	Kaymi aswan hatun runa kayqa.
I mean, it might be early, but .	Niyta munani, ichapas temprano kanman, ichaqa .
That did the job.	Chayqa chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
Once again two.	Huk kuti iskay.
It’s a good thing here.	Kaypiqa allinmi kachkan.
He needed to act faster.	Aswan utqayllam imatapas ruwanan karqa.
Who is not good for him.	Pichus paypaq mana allinchu.
That's how fast.	Chay hina utqaylla.
I couldn’t really help anyone.	Manam chiqaptaqa pitapas yanapayta atirqanichu.
I’m better at it.	Aswan allinmi kani chaypi.
I’ll be together soon.	Pisi tiempollamantan kuska kasaq.
I can’t tell you.	Mana willayta atiymanchu.
People, many people.	Runakuna, achka runakuna.
Who makes a gift.	Pichus huk regalota ruwan.
For what I have done wrong.	Mana allin ruwasqaymanta.
You know? 	Yachankim?
I was a little disappointed.	Huk chhikantan hukmanyasqa karqani.
Here he did remarkably well.	Kaypiqa admirakuypaqmi allinta ruwarqa.
He doesn’t, really.	Payqa manan, cheqaqtachu.
Maybe it was there, after all.	Ichapas chaypi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
He’s not like me at all.	Payqa manan ñoqa hinachu ni imapipas.
Otherwise he wouldn’t have done that otherwise.	Mana chayqa manan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan mana chayqa.
He can’t understand it.	Mana entiendeyta atinchu.
No, he didn’t do that.	Manan, manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He doesn't want to hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyariyta munanchu.
He quickly caught up to her.	Payqa usqhayllan payta hap’irqan.
It will be about two years.	Iskay wata hinam kanqa.
They were tired and exhausted.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa karqanku.
You will have to do so.	Chaynatam ruwanayki kanqa.
He couldn't do anything today.	Payqa kunan punchawqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
Don’t really want to.	Ama chiqaptachu munanki.
Man, this was good.	Runa, kayqa allinmi karqa.
No one knows who this person is yet.	Manaraqmi pipas yachanchu pi kay runa kasqanmanta.
So, it would be great.	Chayna, ancha allin kanman.
He says it should be hidden.	Pakasqa kanan kasqanmanta nin.
But things are no longer right here.	Ichaqa manañan kaypiqa allinchu kashan.
That, they know.	Chaytaqa, yachanku.
All of this is from the past.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
He really doesn't.	Payqa chiqaptam mana.
So go there immediately.	Chaymi chaylla chayman riy.
He barely has time to talk.	Payqa yaqapaschá tiempon kan rimananpaq.
But he refused to talk to her.	Ichaqa manan paywan rimayta munarqanchu.
He quickly went outside.	Payqa utqayllam hawaman lluqsirqa.
It means it was a good day.	Niyta munan allin punchaw kasqanmanta.
Now I want to know.	Kunanqa yachayta munani.
I don't want to think about this.	Kaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta munanichu.
Yes, but it’s not.	Arí, ichaqa manan.
Not bad but not all that good either.	Mana mana allinchu ichaqa mana tukuy chay allinchu nitaq.
They’re getting tired very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam sayk’usqa kachkanku.
I mean, never.	Niyta munani, mana hayk’aqpas.
But they are the real thing.	Ichaqa paykunaqa cheqaq kaqmi kanku.
You can't think about it.	Chaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
That’s just like you.	Chayqa qam hinallam.
I can’t do this stuff.	Manam kay imakunatapas ruwaymanchu.
Great black house.	Hatun yana wasi.
But there, that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa chaypiqa, chayqa unayñan karqan.
One said he did it every other time.	Hukninmi nirqa sapa iskay kutipi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Yesterday,	Qayna pacha, .
You are a human being.	Runa runam kanki.
I think you do it all the time.	Yuyaykuni tukuy tiempo chayta ruwanki.
It’s really, really nice.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta sumaqmi.
But I didn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
Both are important.	Iskayninkum ancha allin.
You can really do anything.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwawaq.
It was a foolish act.	Mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqa.
There is no one like him.	Manan pipas chay hinaqa kanchu.
The man was good.	Runa allinmi karqa.
He looked as serious.	Payqa qhawarisqa hina serio hina.
He's very tired, very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk'usqa, ancha sayk'usqa.
I saw it last night.	Qayna tutam rikurqani.
You can’t get to that point.	Chaymanqa manam chayayta atiwaqchu.
I really can't remember.	Chiqaptaqa manam yuyariyta atinichu.
It was a beautiful, beautiful day.	Sumaq, sumaq punchawmi karqa.
The real kind.	Chiqap laya.
I think it will help a lot.	Yuyaykuni anchata yanapananta.
They were a lot of great.	Achka hatunmi karqaku.
There is no beauty in it.	Mana sumaq kaymi chaypi kachkan.
I think we need to do this.	Kayta ruwananchik tiyan, nispa yuyani.
I know it is very good and very true.	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta hinaspa ancha chiqap kasqanmanta.
Too many, one after another.	Ancha achka, hukmanta hukmanta.
I was a scientist.	Yachaysapa runam karqani.
That’s all he said.	Chayllam nisqa.
That will be next week.	Chayqa hamuq semanan kanqa.
She is sad and lonely.	Payqa llakisqa, sapallanmi.
It was a cold, wet morning.	Chayqa chiri, chiri paqarinmi karqa.
Tired for some reason, very tired.	Imaraykupas sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa.
And that’s what this is.	Hinaspa chaymi kayqa.
The worst thing here would be speed.	Kaypiqa aswan mana allinqa utqaylla ruwaymi kanman.
I didn’t do those things.	Manam chaykunataqa ruwarqanichu.
I think maybe the whole world knows about this.	Yuyaykuni ichapas kaymanta tukuy pacha yachanku.
Happy baseball season!.	¡Kusisqa pacha béisbol!.
But, maybe not always.	Ichaqa, ichapas mana sapa kutichu.
He can’t afford the money.	Mana qullqita atinchu.
I can’t do that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
Hopefully it will be soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla kananta.
Alright? 	Allinmi?
Okay, so that was not an easy task.	Allinmi, chaymi chay ruwayqa mana facilchu karqa.
He wants to live here.	Payqa kaypi tiyayta munan.
There is nowhere to be found.	Mana maypipas kanchu.
Would you like to know why?	¿Imarayku chayta yachayta munankichu.
The process is not difficult.	Chay ruwayqa manan sasachu.
I know, maybe it sounds silly.	Yachanim, ichapas mana yuyayniyuq hina uyarikun.
I didn't mean that, not really.	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu, manam chiqaptachu.
You obviously don’t.	Sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwanki.
He was much bigger than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi karqa.
That has always been true.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chiqap karqa.
Maybe you’ll get hurt.	Ichapas k’irisqa kanki.
I can't hold it anymore.	Manañam hapiyta atinichu.
I don’t think that’s a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allin kananpaqchu yuyaykuni.
But there’s plenty of time for that later.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa askha tiempon kan qhepaman.
This went on for about a week, maybe two.	Kayqa yaqa huk semana hinam karqa, ichapas iskay semana.
I couldn’t see anything, I couldn’t hear anyone.	Manam imatapas rikuyta atirqanichu, manam pitapas uyarirqanichu.
I’m sure he can fix it.	Seguro kani chayta allichayta atisqanmanta.
You know, it really wasn't a big deal.	Yachanki, chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu karqa.
Why are they.	¿Imanasqataq kanku.
But he refused to talk to me.	Ichaqa manan ñoqawan rimayta munarqanchu.
I am very much afraid of that.	Chaytaqa anchatam manchakuni.
There is a chance.	Kanmi chansa.
I couldn’t wait either.	Ñuqapas manam suyayta atirqanichu.
I did everything wrong.	Tukuy imatam mana allinta ruwarqani.
If so, you should do the same.	Chayna kaptinqa qampas chaynatam ruwanayki.
He knew who it was going to be.	Payqa yacharqanmi pichus kananta.
I did the right thing.	Ñuqaqa allintam ruwarqani.
So that was a big one for me.	Chaymi chayqa hatun karqa ñuqapaq.
I wanted to talk to someone.	Piwanpas rimayta munarqani.
She knew he knew what she was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta yachasqanmanta.
He was indeed very happy.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ancha kusisqa kasharqan.
He said he needed help.	Paymi nirqa yanapayta necesitasqanmanta.
And that's all there really is.	Hinaspa chayllam chiqaptaqa kachkan.
It was said yes.	Arí nisqa karqan.
He tried to stop her.	Payqa hark’ayta munarqanmi.
What are you doing.	Imatataq ruwachkanki.
I can't stand it now.	Kunanqa manam aguantayta atiymanchu.
But he didn’t say how it was or anything.	Ichaqa manan nirqanchu imayna kasqanmanta nitaq imatapas.
I have a .	Ñuqaqa huk .
He was hidden away.	Payqa pakasqa kasqa.
A head injury will do though.	Uma k’irisqa ichaqa ruwanqa.
I was indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin karqani.
But if he is.	Ichaqa sichus payqa kanman chayqa.
I didn’t do anything to tell anyone.	Manam imatapas ruwarqanichu pimanpas willanaypaq.
I was sure tomorrow would be better.	Seguro karqani paqarin aswan allin kananta.
But most of the time, it doesn't work.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim mana allintachu.
He was very short-sighted.	Payqa ancha pisi yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
That will totally fail.	Chayqa llapanpim mana allintachu ruwanqa.
It didn't look very good.	Manam ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
This is very clearly not the case.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
Maybe he did it very badly.	Ichapas ancha mana allinta ruwarqa.
It’s easy to repeat.	Yapamanta ruwayqa facilmi.
I never seemed to do it twice.	Manam haykapipas iskay kutita chaynata ruwaq hinachu karqani.
I could barely hear him.	Paytaqa yaqapaschá uyarirqani.
I never knew it would fail.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu mana allinta ruwananpaqqa.
This is really the right thing to do.	Kaymi chiqaptapuni allin ruwayqa.
Then there are people.	Chaymantaqa kanmi runakuna.
Not sure what he means.	Mana segurochu ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He told me he wanted to talk about something.	Paymi niwarqa imamantapas rimayta munasqanmanta.
One of them was with us yesterday.	Hukninmi qayna punchaw ñuqaykuwan karqa.
It wouldn’t be good at all.	Manan imapipas allinchu kanman.
But he still wanted to play.	Ichaqa hinallam pukllayta munarqa.
That’s all it means.	Chayllam niyta munan.
You really have to do something.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwanayki.
It wasn’t good of me.	Mana allinchu karqan ñoqamanta.
Could that really be the case.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayna kanman.
Clearly something is going on here.	Sut’inmi kaypi imapas pasashasqanmanta.
I was faster than I was.	Aswan utqayllam karqani.
It will be innocence.	Chayqa kanqa mana huchayoq kaymi.
And again, humanity.	Hinaspa yapamanta, runa kay.
This couldn't be better.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu kanman.
Go with us, guys.	Riy ñuqaykuwan.
Of course, it wasn't that easy.	Arí, manam chayna facilchu karqa.
Eventually I wanted to say something about him.	Qhepamanmi paymanta imatapas niyta munarqani.
That was a lousy day.	Chayqa millay p’unchaymi karqan.
That was the reality.	Chayqa chiqap kaqmi karqa.
I can be better here.	Kaypiqa aswan allintam kayta atiyman.
I think it's just that.	Chaylla kasqanmantam piensani.
I don't think he will.	Manam piensanichu chaynata ruwananta.
I want to hear and learn.	Uyariyta, yachayta ima munani.
He was the one who spoke about it.	Paymi chaymanta rimaq.
He couldn’t get out.	Mana lluqsiyta atirqachu.
It’s certainly not good enough.	Cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu.
If you want to be happy, you will be happy.	Kusisqa kayta munaspaqa, kusisqam kanki.
But proudly, no.	Ichaqa orgulloso, manan.
It was better than beautiful.	Sumaq kasqanmantaqa aswan allinmi karqa.
And so the challenge came.	Hinaspa chaynatam chay sasachakuy hamurqa.
It is still doing well.	Hinallam allinta ruwachkan.
There is action.	Ruwaymi kan.
But he didn’t say much.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu rimarqan.
But this cannot do it.	Ichaqa manan kayqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
You are here today.	Kunanmi kaypi kachkanki.
I was sure of that.	Chaymantam seguro karqani.
One person couldn’t say anything.	Huk runaqa manan imatapas rimayta atirqanchu.
Go be something else.	Riy huk imapas kay.
First, he said he would come home.	Ñawpaqtaqa wasinman kutimunanta nirqa.
Perhaps he will have to do it now.	Yaqapaschá kunanqa ruwanan kanqa.
No one knew where he was.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
Okay, that’s great.	Allinmi, chayqa ancha allinmi.
All of him.	Tukuy payta.
He took the initiative.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi imatapas ruwarqan.
It was a very nice place.	Chaypiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But there is something that can work.	Ichaqa kanmi imapas allin kanman.
He’s feeling depressed.	Payqa llakisqa tarikun.
Not even if it’s true.	Manam chiqap kaptinpas.
So I was very busy.	Chaymi ancha ocupasqa karqani.
It’s not good enough now.	Kunanqa mana allinchu.
He obviously doesn't want that.	Sut'inmi mana munanchu chayta.
But there is sometimes a misstep.	Ichaqa kanmi wakin kuti pantasqa ruway.
I have no idea where he lives.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani maypi yachasqanmanta.
There is no tomorrow.	Manam paqarin kanchu.
Soon something else would happen, something better.	Pisi tiempollamantan huk imapas kanan karqan, aswan allin kaqmi.
But nothing is as good as the real thing.	Ichaqa manan imapas cheqaq kaq hinaqa allinchu.
No, there was nothing he could do.	Manan, manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
That’s what I want to answer.	Chayqa kutichiyta munani.
The process was a great one.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqan.
That lasted about a week.	Chayqa huk semana hinam karqa.
You were told it was no big deal.	Nisurqanki mana hatun ruwaychu kasqanmanta.
But that was pretty serious.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha sinchi hatunmi karqan.
They are hidden, hidden.	Paykunaqa pakasqa, pakasqa.
I am rather busy at the moment.	Aswan ocupasqa kachkani kunan pacha.
And that's all there is to it.	Hinaspa chaylla chaypiqa kachkan.
It’s sad, so, very sad.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayna, ancha llakikuypaqmi.
It was hard not being there.	Chaypi mana kayqa sasam karqa.
I could really tell.	Chiqamanta willayta atiyman karqa.
However, he is happy now.	Ichaqa, kunanqa kusisqam kachkan.
He wanted her to help him in some way.	Payqa munarqanmi imapipas yanapananta.
We can never get them.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa tariyta atichwanchu.
I guess something is wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman nispaymi suyachkani.
If not tonight.	Mana kunan tuta kaptinqa.
he said a little nervously.	nispas huk chhikanta mancharisqa nisqa.
You don't know what they are here.	Kaypiqa manam yachankichu imakuna kasqankuta.
I am quite happy about that.	Chaymantaqa allintam kusisqa kachkani.
I'm really, really proud of that.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam chaymanta orgulloso kani.
If you want to be someone, do something.	Pipas kayta munaspaqa imatapas ruway.
But I’m the only one.	Ichaqa ñuqallam kani.
About a year later, he was reinstated.	Yaqa huk wata qhepamanmi hukmanta churasqa karqan.
I don’t really know how to respond to that.	Chaymanqa manan allintachu yachani imayna kutichiyta.
I really don’t want to tell the story of this.	Chiqamanta mana munanichu kayta willayta willayta.
At least I didn’t do that.	Aswanpas manan chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
But, tell me something.	Ichaqa, imatapas willaway.
Maybe he doesn’t.	Ichapas payqa mana.
Something black and scary.	Imapas yana manchay.
If you don’t agree with that, that’s fine.	Mana chaywan acuerdopichu kanki chayqa, allinmi.
He realized he couldn’t stop her.	Payqa repararqanmi mana hark’ayta atisqanmanta.
There was no other reason.	Manam huk imaraykupas karqachu.
But in this day and age.	Ichaqa kay tiempopiqa.
He will be like a good guy.	Allin ruwaq hinam kanqa.
Yes, very much so.	Arí, anchata.
You are the same person.	Qamqa kikin runam kanki.
Now is the time to learn.	Kunanmi yachay pacha.
This would be foolish.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kanman.
It was a tough week, a tough day.	Chayqa karqan sinchi semanan, sinchi p’unchaymi karqan.
That's still pretty great, though.	Chayqa hinallam ancha hatun, ichaqa.
But there is nothing like home.	Ichaqa wasi hinaqa manan kanchu.
Never mind that.	Ama hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
At the time, he was angry that this was the case.	Chay tiempopiqa phiñasqa kasharqan chhayna kasqanmanta.
This would not be an easy task.	Kayqa manan facil ruwaychu kanman.
That turned out not too bad.	Chayqa mana ancha mana allinchu lluqsirqa.
They are not like other people.	Paykunaqa manan huk runakuna hinachu kanku.
Perhaps he meant in the future.	Ichapas hamuq tiempopi niyta munarqa.
But it is such a thing.	Ichaqa chay hina kaqmi.
It had to be done properly.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwana karqa.
It could be better but it doesn’t seem right.	Aswan allinmi kanman ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
I have made the right decision.	Chaytaqa allintam tantearuni.
Tell me how to do this right.	Kayta allinta ruwanaypaq willaway.
You know how and where too well.	Imaynata, maypi llumpay allinta yachanki.
But it was a bit awkward.	Ichaqa huk chhikantan mana allinchu karqan.
He was too good to be true.	Payqa llumpay allinmi karqa.
He will certainly do it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanqa.
You have done these things.	Chaykunataqa qanmi ruwarqanki.
He's probably got it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta hap'irqan.
But this is the first one.	Ichaqa kaymi ñawpaq kaq.
I still couldn't remember anything.	Kunankamapas manam imatapas yuyariyta atirqanichu.
Someone had to be better than that.	Pipas chaymanta aswan allin kanan karqa.
But it’s okay if you don’t want to.	Ichaqa mana munaspaqa allinmi.
Not a bad time.	Mana millay pacha.
He thought he would do most of the talking.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi yaqa llapan rimayta ruwananta.
This is ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinam.
He didn’t know how to drive.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna manejayta.
This made everything easier.	Chaywanmi tukuy imapas aswan facil karqa.
And if he does that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwaptinqa.
They are worthless.	Paykunaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
It took about a year.	Yaqa huk wata hinam pasarqa.
It’s a wonderful place to be.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi chaypi kayqa.
You are a stranger.	Qamqa mana riqsisqa runam kanki.
If true, this makes no sense.	Chiqap kaptinqa, kayqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.	Ichapas payqa kachkan, manapaschá.
No, not that, he said firmly.	Manan, manan chaytachu, nispas sinchita nisqa.
Maybe not so much.	Ichapas mana anchatachu.
Now, that’s not all.	Kunanqa, mana chayllachu.
He doesn’t know like any other.	Payqa manan huk hinachu yachan.
I don't know this for sure.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu yachani.
At one time, this was the largest crowd.	Huk tiempopiqa kayqa aswan achka runakunam karqa.
I don't believe this at all.	Kaytaqa manam imapipas creenichu.
Hopefully, it will be nice.	Munaymanmi, sumaqmi kanqa.
Know who you want to talk to.	Piwan rimayta munasqaykita yachay.
People are like that.	Runakunaqa chhayna kanku.
Or two things.	Utaq iskay imapas.
Nothing like him.	Mana imapas pay hinaqa.
Very very, I'm really sorry.	Ancha ancha, chiqaptam llakikuni.
Everyone was mad at him.	Lliwmi paywan phiñasqa karqaku.
Still maybe.	Hinallam ichapas.
It was probably that good.	Yaqapaschá chayna allin karqa.
And it happened again.	Hinaspa yapamanta pasarqa.
Probably the second one.	Yaqapaschá iskay kaq.
Everything is evil.	Tukuy ima millay.
He wouldn't do that anymore.	Payqa manañan chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
Yes, they know what he does.	Arí, paykunaqa yachanku ima ruwasqanmanta.
The problem since then.	Chaymanta pacha sasachakuy.
That was some of the best.	Chayqa wakin aswan allinmi karqa.
I feel better than anything.	Imamantapas aswan allinmi sientekuni.
I’m still exhausted.	Hinallam sayk’usqa kachkani.
It was always busy.	Sapa kutim ocupasqa karqa.
And then ten years.	Hinaspa chaymanta chunka wata.
He never knows anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas yachanchu.
He said he was one of them.	Paymi nirqa huknin kasqanmanta.
The child sometimes says no.	Wawa wakin mana nin.
He knew that very well.	Payqa allintam chayta yacharqa.
She said she couldn't sleep.	Payqa nirqam manaña puñuyta atisqanmanta.
Black people are black.	Yana runakunaqa yana kanku.
I'll be here for a long time.	Unayñam kaypi kasaq.
Just don’t be here.	Chaylla ama kaypi kaychu.
But then you knew that, of course.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chaytan yacharqanki, sut’inmi.
She knew he knew it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta yachasqanmanta.
Now it is useless.	Kunanqa manañan imapaqpas valenchu.
More to come each week!.	¡Astawan sapa semana hamunqa!.
People are no longer human.	Runakunaqa manañam runa kaychu.
He thinks they are real.	Payqa piensanmi cheqaq kasqankuta.
He had to do something today.	Kunan punchawmi imatapas ruwanan karqa.
He went crazy.	Payqa loco hinam rirqa.
You didn’t just do it.	Manam chayllachu chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
But he knew it was too good.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi nishuta allin kasqanmanta.
I almost never got to see him.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas payta rikuyta atirqanichu.
It was all him.	Lliwmi pay karqa.
If that’s all there is to it.	Sichus chaylla kanman chayqa.
Now now that.	Kunanqa kunan chayta.
I didn’t really want to go out into the city.	Manam chiqaptachu llaqtaman lluqsiyta munarqani.
It’s truly amazing.	Chiqamanta admirakuypaqmi.
I'm still eager to give it a go.	Hinallam anchata munani huk kutita ruwayta.
They were all really good.	Llapallankum chiqap allin karqaku.
You do things to make things better.	Imapas allinta ruwanaykipaqmi imatapas ruwanki.
But no one can help him.	Ichaqa manan pipas yanapayta atinmanchu.
That’s it, nothing.	Chayqa, mana imapas.
The process is surprisingly difficult.	Chay ruwayqa admirakuypaqmi sasa.
I wasn’t sure at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu karqani.
Do this several times.	Achka kutita chayta ruway.
That was a good thing he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa allinmi karqa.
He didn’t want to see anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rikuyta munarqanchu.
They are right there.	Paykunaqa allintam chaypiqa kanku.
He was there, after all.	Payqa chaypim karqa, tukuy imamanta.
But that’s what you said.	Ichaqa chaytan nirqanki.
He doesn’t want to go there.	Mana chayman riyta munanchu.
Now I am very sad and doubtful.	Kunanqa anchatam llakikuni hinaspa iskayrayani.
He wanted to be home.	Payqa wasinpi kaytam munarqa.
He wants to sit down.	Tiyayta munan.
What could be the problem.	Imataq kanman chay sasachakuy.
They are, after all, irrational.	Paykunaqa, tukuy imamanta, mana yuyayniyuq kanku.
He does it well.	Payqa allintam chaytaqa ruwan.
Really, it couldn’t be worse than this.	Chiqamanta, mana kaymanta astawan mana allinchu kanman.
I said it was right.	Allintam nirqani.
If it is, of course.	Sichus kashan chayqa, cheqaqtapunin.
You never really know.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachankichu.
Anywhere, actually.	Maypipas, chiqaptaqa.
And she said this happens all the time.	Hinaspa payqa nirqa kayqa tukuy tiempo pasasqanmanta.
Who is he.	Pitaq payqa.
It was a strange night.	Chayqa huk mana riqsisqa tutam karqa.
I’m waiting for something to happen.	Suyachkani imapas pasananta.
He said he wanted to do something.	Paymi nirqa imatapas ruwayta munasqanmanta.
This is a terrible man.	Kayqa manchay runam.
He wasn’t happy about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta kusisqachu kasharqan.
I still couldn’t understand it.	Kunankamapas manam entiendeyta atirqanichu.
He seemed fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Then he had to act accordingly.	Chay qhepamanmi chayman hina ruwanan karqan.
Nice but stupid.	Sumaq ichaqa sonso.
So he started driving.	Chayraykum payqa carrota manejayta qallaykurqa.
There are bad people.	Mana allin runakunaqa kanmi.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaqmi.
What a beautiful experience that was.	Ima sumaqmi chayqa karqa.
That is a much more difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa aswan sasa ruwaymi.
I wanted to play it.	Chayta pukllayta munarqani.
He was tired and angry.	Payqa sayk’usqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
It was a stranger.	Chayqa mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
Here’s everything.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas kachkan.
But the first must be alone.	Ichaqa ñawpaq kaqmi sapallan kanan.
I really hope he does.	Chiqaptam suyachkani chayta ruwananta.
Last night not doing well.	Qayna tuta mana allinta ruwaspa.
Then how many months.	Chaymanta hayka killa.
Very likely he did.	Ancha yaqapaschá chaynata ruwarqa.
But he did nothing.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas ruwarqanchu.
It’s the last one in town.	Llaqtapi qhipa kaqmi.
You want to be consistent.	Chayman hina kayta munanki.
He was strong about this.	Payqa sinchitan kaymanta rimarqan.
Nothing is terribly wrong.	Mana imapas manchay mana allinchu.
Someone with a bad attitude.	Pipas mana allin yuyayniyuq.
He wants to talk about me.	Payqa ñuqamanta rimayta munan.
In fact, they’re both great.	Chiqaptaqa, iskayninkum ancha allin.
It was another one again.	Yapamanta hukninmi karqa.
And this is all.	Hinaspa kaymi llapan.
Know where they are at all times.	Maypi kasqankuta tukuy tiempo yachay.
But the reality was harder.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi aswan sasa karqan.
The immediacy was important.	Chaylla ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Everyone was rich.	Lliwmi qhapaq karqaku.
This is truly food season.	Kayqa chiqamanta mikhuy pacha.
The truth was, he didn't really want to know.	Chiqap kaqmi karqa, payqa manam chiqaptachu yachayta munarqa.
He might do something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas ruwanman.
After all, he was extremely drunk.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa sinchi machasqa kasqa.
Like everything else.	Tukuy imapas hina.
Almost too much.	Yaqa llumpay.
I knew it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanim.
You certainly did this time.	Cheqaqtapunin kay kutipi ruwarqanki.
That seemed so wrong.	Chayqa ancha pantasqa hinam karqa.
Now, that’s not true.	Kunanqa, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
And alone.	Hinaspa sapallan.
Find out why this happened.	Imarayku chay pasasqanmanta yachay.
Crazy people are like who.	Loco runakunaqa pikuna hinam kanku.
What’s the matter with it.	Imataq chaymanta.
I pretty much do that now.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwani.
This made a lot of sense.	Kayqa anchatam yuyayniyuq karqa.
Unless, for sure, this weekend.	Mana chayqa, seguro, kay semana tukukuypi.
He is afraid to be alone with me.	Payqa manchakunmi ñoqawan sapallan kayta.
If this all seems familiar, it should.	Sichus kay tukuy riqsisqa hina rikchakun chayqa, kanan tiyan.
Like, a lot of it.	Imayna, achka chaymanta.
I'm probably the one.	Yaqapaschá chayna kani.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Payqa allintan yacharqan ima ruwasqanmanta.
I was the first to do it.	Ñuqam puntata ruwarqani.
However, it really is very easy to do.	Ichaqa, chiqaptam ancha facil ruwayqa.
Disappointed, but not surprised.	Hukmanyasqa, ichaqa mana admirasqa.
I probably want to be a teacher.	Yaqapaschá yachachiq kayta munani.
So this is a tough time.	Chaymi kayqa sinchi sasa pacha.
Even if he is not there.	Manaña chaypi kaptinpas.
It worked for me accordingly.	Chayman hinam ñuqapaq allin karqa.
There really are no good people.	Chiqaptaqa manam allin runakunaqa kanchu.
But this man needs to be important.	Ichaqa kay runaqa importante kaytan necesitan.
Three days at most.	Kimsa punchaw aswan achka.
That this man could believe that, about me.	Chayta kay runa creeyta atisqanmanta, ñuqamanta.
It’s a great man.	Hatunmi runa.
He’d been caught.	Payqa hap’isqa kasqa.
The only one, in fact.	Chay sapallan, chiqaptaqa.
I know what it is as a player.	Yachanim pukllaq hina ima kasqanmanta.
I'm not sure there is one.	Manam segurochu kani huk kasqanmanta.
Then he seemed almost happy.	Chaymantaqa yaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
I am a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runam kani.
That day is today.	Chay punchawqa kunan punchawmi.
Maybe you think he’s sick.	Ichapas unqusqa kasqanmanta yuyanki.
He shared some of his thoughts.	Paymi willarqan wakin yuyaykusqanmanta.
That didn’t seem like a problem.	Chayqa manan sasachakuy hinachu karqan.
If it weren't for me, he'd be a worse person.	Mana ñuqa kaspayqa aswan mana allin runam kanman.
That’s easy, very easy.	Chayqa facilmi, ancha facilmi.
I always wanted to quit.	Sapa kutim saqiyta munarqani.
He had to do it again several times.	Achka kutitam yapamanta ruwanan karqa.
This wasn’t always the case.	Kayqa manan sapa kuti hinachu karqan.
I was always, always cold.	Sapa kuti, sapa kuti chiri karqani.
It was safer.	Aswan segurom karqa.
First of all, it’s time.	Ñawpaqtaqa tiempon.
He couldn’t see his house.	Manas wasinta rikuyta atirqachu.
I guess I thought so.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa piensarqani.
Therefore,	Chay hinaqa, .
You were drunk.	Machasqa karqanki.
Not nearly as good.	Mana yaqa allinchu.
I'm pretty sure it's black.	Yana kasqanmantaqa allintam yachani.
After all, he was a teacher.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa yachachiq karqa.
Great, happy with that.	Hatun, kusisqa chaywan.
And people here are hungry.	Hinaspa kaypi runakunaqa yarqasqa kachkanku.
Some of what he couldn’t find, he could work out.	Wakin mana tariyta atisqanmanta, payqa llamk’ayta atinman karqan.
Sorry, but there it is.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
This morning, early, first thing.	Kunan paqarin, temprano, ñawpaq kaq.
Perhaps he was in trouble.	Yaqapaschá sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
That statement is certainly valid.	Chay nisqanqa cheqaqtapunin allinpaq qhawarisqa.
Now something doesn’t feel right.	Kunanqa imapas mana allintachu sientekuni.
I heard a story recently.	Chayllaraqmi huk willakuyta uyarirqani.
After all, he was an adult.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa kuraq runa karqa.
He was a man, a child.	Payqa runa, wawa kasqa.
I was in the country about a month ago.	Yaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi chay nacionpi karqani.
That is usually a good thing.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim allin kaq.
It is not yet	Manaraqmi .
Every action can be useful.	Sapa ruwaymi allin kanman.
It seemed very stupid.	Ancha sonso hinam karqa.
He was effectively dismissed.	Payqa allintam qarqusqa karqa.
They’re new here.	Paykunaqa kaypi musuq kanku.
That was a one-off.	Chayqa huk kutilla karqan.
Something should be easy and repeatable.	Imapas facilmi kanan hinaspa yapamanta ruwana.
That’s not going to work though.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa ichaqa.
Worse than the night before.	Ñawpaq tutamanta aswan mana allin.
About every three weeks.	Yaqa sapa kimsa semana.
But it wouldn’t be true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu kanman.
It would be the only thing.	Chaylla kanman.
Again, maybe it is.	Yapamanta, ichapas chayna kanman.
I’m afraid to leave.	Manchakuni ripuyta.
This sounds very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi uyarikun.
It must be amazing!.	¡Admirakuypaqmi kanan!.
I didn’t notice that at all.	Chaytaqa manan repararqanichu ni imapipas.
Learn what it is.	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachay.
This, however, is a good thing.	Kayqa ichaqa allinmi.
Yes, they were stupid.	Arí, paykunaqa sonso karqanku.
She’s much nicer now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan sumaqmi.
It’s all good though.	Tukuy allinmi ichaqa.
But I like it.	Ichaqa gustanmi.
I know, that's it.	Yachanim, chayta.
But you’ve been with me for a long time.	Ichaqa unayñan ñoqawan kashanki.
Both are safe.	Iskayninkum seguro kachkanku.
it is.	kayqa.
He didn't go out all day.	Payqa manam tukuy punchawchu lluqsirqa.
He never wanted to know.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yachayta munarqanchu.
He maintained that he could not see it.	Payqa hinallam nirqa mana qawayta atisqanmanta.
I don’t know how to describe it.	Manan yachanichu imaynatachus willayta.
It will be amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanqa.
No one likes to be caught.	Manan pimanpas gustanchu hap’isqa kayta.
So you can’t buy it.	Chaymi mana rantiyta atiwaqchu.
In most cases, that would be enough.	Yaqa llapanpim chaylla kanman.
The first time he wanted to talk about it.	Ñawpaq kutipi chaymanta rimayta munarqa.
This is really interesting.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
He is by no means alone in this.	Payqa manan imapipas sapallanchu chaypiqa.
He was alone in the house.	Payqa sapallanmi chay wasipi kasqa.
It’s harder this time.	Aswan sasa kay kutipi.
Man, all very human.	Runa, tukuy ancha runa.
Maybe it’s almost likely.	Ichapas yaqapaschá kanman.
I think you know what it is.	Yuyaykuni ima kasqanmanta yachasqaykita.
He was probably older than her.	Payqa yaqapaschá paymanta kuraq karqan.
Everyone was with him.	Lliwmi paywan karqaku.
You’re going to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanki.
I just thought it was a beautiful dress.	Chayllaraqmi piensarqani sumaq pacha kasqanmanta.
Anyone have any other ideas?.	¿Pipas huk yuyayniyuqchu?.
This makes no sense.	Kayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Maybe that’s what it’s all about.	Ichapas chayna tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
This is the one here.	Kay kaypi kaq.
We have three ideas.	Kimsa yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
But if you do, you do.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanki chayqa, ruwanki.
I wasn't ready before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam listochu karqani.
Early and often, day and night.	Temprano hinaspa sapa kuti, tuta punchaw.
I was one of them.	Huk kaqmi karqani.
So, tell me .	Chaymi, willaway .
That is once every year.	Chayqa sapa wata huk kutim.
This guy was serious.	Kay runaqa serio kasqa.
Ultimately, this was not the case.	Qhepamanmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
If you do things a certain way, things are fine.	Sichus imatapas wakin hinata ruwanki chayqa, imapas allinmi.
That is .	Kaymi .
I feel very secure here.	Kaypiqa ancha segurom tarikuni.
But this is short-sighted.	Ichaqa kayqa pisi yuyayniyuqmi.
Anything could be better.	Imapas aswan allinmi kanman.
He certainly couldn’t have done anything else.	Cheqaqtapunin mana allintachu hukta ruwayta atinman karqan.
This should be good!.	¡Kayqa allinmi kanan!.
I wonder what his name is.	Ima sutinmi nispa tapukuni.
You were a wonderful teacher.	Ancha sumaq yachachiqmi karqanki.
I suspect it did.	Sospechani chay ruwasqanmanta.
The sooner the better.	Aswan utqaylla ruwaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Many people are in prison.	Achka runakunam carcelpi kachkan.
You knew that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yacharqanki.
I can't wait to see what happens.	Mana suyayta atinichu imachus pasananta qawayta.
It looked uncertain.	Mana segurochu rikchakurqa.
Which looks nicer.	Imataq aswan sumaq rikch’akun.
So I’ll do it.	Chaymi ruwasaq.
He couldn’t understand it at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas entiendeyta atirqanchu.
You know it's wrong.	Yachankim mana allin kasqanmanta.
And right now.	Hinaspa kunanpacha.
She knows she looks beautiful.	Payqa yachanmi sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
I'm not sure if it's too much.	Manam segurochu kani sichus ancha achka kasqanmanta.
Yes, go ahead.	Arí, riy.
It seems silly, actually.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam rikchakun, chiqaptaqa.
I didn’t have that in mind.	Manam chayna yuyayniyuqchu karqani.
Easier than this.	Kaymanta aswan facil.
Tell me quickly.	Usqhaylla willay.
Not my own.	Mana ñuqapa.
Fresh, delicious food.	Musuq, sumaq mikhuy.
I’m not the bad guy here.	Manam kaypi millay runachu kani.
I can’t think of it now.	Manam kunanqa yuyaymanayta atinichu.
This has happened many times.	Achka kutim chayna pasarqa.
If anything happens.	Sichus imapas kanman chayqa.
That is why this happened.	Chayraykum kayqa pasarqa.
That’s all they were.	Chayqa chayllam karqaku.
Who knows, maybe he is.	Pi yachan, ichapas payqa.
That may not be too difficult.	Chayqa manapaschá ancha sasachu.
This was a wonderful night.	Kayqa ancha sumaq tutam karqa.
That, and .	Chayqa, hinaspa .
I never felt comfortable in it.	Manam haykapipas allintachu chaypiqa tarikurqani.
He could get away with it.	Payqa chaymanta lluqsiyta atinman karqa.
He seems to be drunk.	Payqa machasqa hinam kachkan.
Great day, tomorrow.	Hatun punchaw, paqarin.
But it hardly makes any sense.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana imapaqpas valenchu.
A serious one.	Huk serio kaq.
But it sure is here somewhere.	Ichaqa seguro kaypi maypipas kachkan.
He was truly his.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin paypaq karqan.
You decide to do nothing.	Mana imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi yuyaykunki.
He wasn't sure he would.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwananmanta.
A house.	Huk wasi.
Know where you can help.	Maypi yanapayta atisqaykita yachay.
That was too much stuff for me.	Chayqa karqa ñuqapaq llumpay achka kaqmi.
I am not a stupid person.	Manam mana yuyayniyuq runachu kani.
That’s something interesting.	Chayqa imapas sumaqmi.
He didn’t talk much to anyone anymore.	Manañam pimanpas anchatachu rimaq.
I would love to know that.	Chayta yachayta anchata munani.
And it does that.	Hinaspa chayta ruwan.
Do it again if you want.	Munaspaqa hukmanta ruway.
To do so would be extremely foolish.	Chayta ruwayqa llumpay mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
That is usually the case.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim chayna.
So this is the day.	Chaymi kay punchawqa.
Make it so'.	Chayna kananpaq ruway'.
He gave me permission to do so.	Chaynata ruwanaypaqmi permisota quwarqa.
He was really human.	Payqa chiqaptam runa karqa.
He was right, it was great.	Payqa allintam nirqa, ancha allinmi karqa.
He never does anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas ruwanchu.
Maybe this has something to do with it.	Ichapas kayqa chaywan kuska kanman.
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqapaq karqa.
I feel tired of it.	Chaywanmi sayk’usqa sientekuni.
We certainly did that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqayku.
I can do this job.	Kay llamkayta ruwayta atiyman.
A new me.	Huk musuq ñuqa.
They are really out there.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam hawapi kachkanku.
But he couldn’t be serious.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu serio kayta.
I’m more intelligent.	Ñuqaqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi kani.
But he never could.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
Not such a bad guy, at all.	Mana chayna millay runachu, ni imapipas.
Nobody really wants to get away with anything.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa imamantapas lluqsiyta munanchu.
Maybe we can’t.	Ichapas mana atichwanchu.
But he had a great time with it.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi chaywanqa karqa.
I don’t know anyone.	Manam pitapas riqsinichu.
He was certainly new.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mosoq karqan.
I just wanted to tell you.	Chayllam willayta munarqani.
Most of the time it would have been.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna kanman karqa.
He’s a nice guy and all.	Payqa sumaq runam hinaspa llapan.
It wasn’t loneliness that mattered.	Manan sapallan kaychu importante karqan.
I should have done that earlier.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanay karqa.
It's happened here before.	Kaypiqa ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
He was very tough.	Payqa ancha sinchitan karqan.
I hope all is well.	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananpaq.
No one disagreed.	Manam pipas mana acuerdopichu karqa.
But he would not be able to speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atinmanchu karqan.
You want to remember.	Yuyariyta munanki.
He was sure of it now.	Payqa kunanmi chaymanta seguro kasqa.
It would be wrong not to do so.	Mana chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I wouldn't do it again.	Manañam hukmanta ruwaymanchu karqa.
He would be better.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman.
Yeah, okay, thank you.	Arí, allinmi, gracias.
But I'm sure it's wrong.	Ichaqa segurom kani mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
With the exception of most things.	Yaqa llapan imapas mana kaptinqa.
He was like that.	Payqa chayna hinam karqa.
He certainly didn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
That’s the time.	Chay tiempon.
But he didn’t want to hear that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu uyariyta munarqan.
Here is a first step.	Kaypi huk ñawpaq kaq ruway kachkan.
He checked once, checked twice to make sure.	Huk kutita qhawarisqa, iskay kutita qhawarisqa seguro kananpaq.
But he was such a great man.	Ichaqa chhayna hatun runan karqan.
Or was, once upon a time.	Utaq karqan, huk kuti.
I’m ready to succeed.	Allinta ruwanaypaqmi listo kashani.
That there was no one out there.	Chay hawapi mana pipas kasqanmanta.
Obviously I wanted to be there.	Sut’inmi chaypi kayta munarqani.
That’s what he decided to do as soon as possible.	Chaytan usqhaylla ruwananpaq yuyaykurqan.
He still wasn't sure why.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu yacharqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I want you to be with me.	Munani ñoqawan kuska kanaykita.
It was the biggest, but not the only one.	Aswan hatunmi karqan, ichaqa manan sapallanchu.
In doing so, we made an important discovery.	Chayta ruwaspan huk importante tariyta ruwarqayku.
That was the first day.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq p’unchaymi.
Hopefully it was good.	Munaymanmi allin kasqanmanta.
I am always alone.	Sapa kutim sapallay kachkani.
Like, really new.	Imayna, chiqap musuq.
I saw him that night.	Chay tutan payta rikurqani.
That’s who he used to be.	Chayqa pichus ñawpaqtaqa karqan.
He can't hold it anymore.	Manañam hapiyta atinchu.
I could have grabbed a cup of coffee.	Huk kukata hap’iyta atiyman karqan.
But this is easy.	Ichaqa kayqa facilmi.
Here, or here.	Kaypi, icha kaypi.
They seemed happy with it.	Chaywanqa kusisqa hinam karqaku.
It’s ridiculously large.	Asikunapaq hina hatunmi.
He knows what to do in a crisis.	Payqa yachanmi sasachakuypi ima ruwananta.
He is hidden there.	Payqa chaypi pakasqa kachkan.
Again, nothing wrong.	Yapamanta, mana ima mana allinchu.
I couldn’t go to school.	Manam escuelaman riyta atirqanichu.
I don’t feel comfortable.	Mana allinchu sientekuni.
The night is cold and cold.	Tutaqa chiri, chiri.
I am an everyday person.	Sapa punchaw runam kani.
It means a lot.	Achkatam niyta munan.
This, he says.	Kayta, nispas nin.
Yes, he knows where he is.	Arí, maypi kasqanmantam yachan.
He was a great guy.	Hatun runam karqa.
Now that was a good guy.	Kunanqa chayqa allin runan kasqa.
It's safer, for you.	Aswan segurom, qampaq.
Would love to stay at her place again.	Munaymanmi hukmanta wasinpi qhepakuyta.
It’s really, really nice.	Chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi.
Probably there was none of that.	Manapaschá chaymantaqa karqanchu.
She’s the youngest child, the only girl.	Payqa sullk’a wawa, sapallan sipasmi.
I was busy, but busy in a good way.	Ocupasqa karqani, ichaqa allintam ocupasqa karqani.
Here is a letter.	Kaypi huk cartata kachkan.
Man, what a day.	Runa, ima punchaw.
About being alone.	Sapallan kaymanta.
And it’s about me.	Hinaspa ñuqamanta.
And the worst part.	Hinaspa aswan mana allin kaq.
Today was the day he was.	Kunan punchawmi punchaw karqa paymi karqa.
It wouldn’t be a bad thing.	Mana mana allinchu kanman.
It’s not good in every way.	Tukuy imapipas mana allinchu.
It was better this way.	Aswan allinmi karqan kay hinaqa.
I never have until now.	Manam haykapipas kunankamaqa kanchu.
The world right now.	Kay pacha kunanpacha.
And more of my time than anything else.	Hinaspa aswan achka tiempoy imamantapas.
I almost wanted to go.	Yaqapaschá riyta munarqani.
It should be faster.	Aswan utqaylla kanan tiyan.
I am not in a position to tell you.	Manam willanaypaq hinachu kachkani.
But he can’t sleep.	Ichaqa manan puñuyta atinchu.
She was terribly beautiful.	Payqa manchay sumaqmi karqa.
That evil world.	Chay millay pacha.
Otherwise, try this step.	Mana chayqa, kay ruwayta ruway.
He knew exactly what it was.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima kasqanmanta.
Couldn’t stop listening!.	¡Mana uyariyta saqiyta atirqachu!.
It’s not like this secret.	Manan kay pakasqa hinachu.
I’m not quite old enough.	Manam allintachu kuraq kani.
I am so sorry for being late.	Anchatam llakikuni tarde kasqaymanta.
He knew how that felt.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay imayna sientekusqanmanta.
Here is a stranger.	Kaypiqa huk mana riqsisqa runam kachkan.
It just kind of came out of him.	Chaylla huk laya lluqsirqa paymanta.
I am better than you.	Ñoqaqa qanmanta aswan allinmi kani.
It wasn’t quite there yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu karqa.
Please let me know if this is useful.	Ama hina kaspa, willaway sichus kay allin kanman chayqa.
Everyone has their own preferences.	Sapa runam ima munasqanman hina kan.
He should have been very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kanan karqa.
That’s what he told me.	Chaytan payqa willarqan.
I almost saw it.	Yaqapaschá rikurqani.
But here it is not.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan.
Faster than me, even.	Aswan utqaylla ñuqamanta, astawan.
That's how I agree with him.	Chaynatam paywan acuerdopi kani.
You never know who’s going to win it.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu pichus chayta atipananta.
It really has to go.	Chiqamanta rinan tiyan.
There was a man there.	Chaypin huk runa kasqa.
He’s a terrific player.	Payqa manchay pukllaqmi.
That will be a tragedy.	Chayqa llakikuypaqmi kanqa.
I don’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munani.
No one could ever know.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yachayta atinmanchu karqan.
Speed ​​may not be as effective as it used to be.	Utqaylla ruwayqa manapaschá ñawpaqpi hinachu allin kanman.
Go big or go home.	Hatun riy utaq wasiykiman riy.
He was not a stranger.	Payqa manam mana riqsisqa runachu karqa.
Now forgive me.	Kunanqa pampachaykuway.
Now, that’s a rich man.	Kunanqa, chayqa qhapaq runa.
He has to conform like everyone else.	Payqa llapa runakuna hinam chayman hina ruwanan.
It was great to be home.	Ancha allinmi karqa wasipi kayqa.
He loves to watch.	Payqa anchatam munan qawayta.
I really didn’t want to leave.	Chiqaptaqa manam ripuyta munarqanichu.
It was always there.	Sapa kutim karqa.
Which doesn’t mean it’s wrong.	Imataq mana pantasqa kasqanmanta niyta munanchu.
But that’s the main thing.	Ichaqa chaymi aswan allinqa.
Actually that’s all.	Chiqaptaqa chayllam.
I was there that night.	Chay tutam chaypi karqani.
Everything is not very good.	Tukuy imapas manam ancha allinchu.
That’s what it says.	Chaytan nin.
One can never know.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachayta atinmanchu.
It was too difficult for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay sasam karqa.
I do these things all the time.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim ruwani.
The real secret.	Chiqap pakasqa.
You can’t ignore that.	Manan chaytaqa mana uyariyta atiwaqchu.
I know something is very wrong.	Yachanim imapas ancha mana allin kasqanmanta.
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Manam millay ruwaychu karqa.
Not me, then some time.	Manam ñuqachu, chaymanta wakin pacha.
This is good for you.	Kayqa allinmi qampaq.
Not as good, but almost.	Mana allin hinachu, aswanpas yaqa.
He couldn't again, not today.	Manas yapamanta atirqachu, mana kunan p'unchawchu.
All right, now.	Allinmi, kunanqa.
He went for a walk.	Puriq rirqa.
He talked to her every other day.	Payqa sapa iskay punchawmi paywan rimaq.
That’s what I like about him.	Chayqa paymanta gustanmi.
They were me.	Paykunaqa ñuqam karqani.
They're here so he couldn't find them.	Paykunaqa kaypi kachkanku chaymi mana tariyta atirqachu.
He sprang into action quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwayman haykurqan.
You’re a good girl.	Allin sipasmi kanki.
He seemed a little more worried, now.	Payqa aswan pisi llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa, kunanqa.
Yes, it was three weeks ago.	Arí, kimsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He knew they were both tired.	Payqa yacharqanmi iskayninku sayk’usqa kasqankuta.
I had to do something and quickly.	Imatapas ruwanay karqan hinaspa usqhaylla.
Again we disagree.	Yapamanta mana acuerdopichu kayku.
It just seemed silly.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinallam rikchakurqa.
It still looked great.	Hinallam ancha sumaq rikchakurqa.
I'm the youngest.	Sullk'a kaqmi kani.
He told me who to talk to.	Paymi niwarqa piwan rimanaypaq.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Manan pipas paywan rimayta munarqanchu.
And then there’s me.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ñuqapas kachkani.
But what in the world.	Ichaqa imataq kay pachapi.
He was faster than me.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan utqayllam karqa.
I want to know who he is.	Pi kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I don’t feel bad about it at all.	Manam imapipas chaymantaqa mana allintachu sientekuni.
It’s hidden here.	Kaypiqa pakasqa kachkan.
They are crazy beautiful.	Paykunaqa loco sumaqmi kanku.
Outside, he said.	Hawapi, nispa.
I found out a year ago.	Huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani.
He didn’t seem worried about it.	Manas chaymanta llakisqa hinachu kasqa.
But really, people.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapuni, runakuna.
Obviously he left in a big hurry.	Sut’inmi hatun usqhaylla ripurqan.
Obviously something is wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Is it really?.	¿Cheqaqtachu?.
They are all wicked.	Llapallankum millay kanku.
They’re not very human, but they’re pretty nice.	Paykunaqa manan ancha runachu, ichaqa allin sumaqmi kanku.
It’s obviously better that way.	Sut’inmi aswan allin chay hinaqa.
This is a sensible approach.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuq ruwaymi.
He likes it well enough.	Paytaqa allintam gustan.
Scientists are people.	Yachaysapa runakunaqa runakunam.
That’s pretty much the same as adults.	Chayqa yaqapaschá kuraq runakuna hina.
Let me know if you want to work.	Llamkayta munaspaqa willaway.
You can’t, boy.	Mana atiwaqchu, wayna.
It was good, he says.	Allinmi karqa, nispas nin.
It was actually quite interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He said it again yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi yapamanta nirqa.
I don’t know why he said that.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna nisqanta.
But it’s amazing.	Ichaqa admirakuypaqmi.
I'm there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kachkani.
He wanted to, but he wasn’t quite ready.	Payqa munarqanmi, ichaqa manan allintachu listo kasharqan.
It is .	Kayqa .
I'm not quite sure how to go about it.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam chayman risaq.
That was twenty years ago, maybe.	Chayqa iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa, ichapas.
I can do better today.	Kunan punchawmi aswan allinta ruwayta atiyman.
I have been there many times.	Achka kutim chaypi karqani.
Everything is well laid out.	Tukuy imapas allinta churasqa.
I hope this is not true.	Suyachkani kayqa mana chiqap kananpaq.
These must be done in advance.	Chaykunataqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwana.
I’m probably here now.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá kaypi kachkani.
Maybe it’s best to go.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman riy.
He knew he wanted her.	Payqa yacharqanmi payta munasqanta.
That was a very good thing to do.	Chayqa ancha allin ruwaymi karqa.
I'll do it for you.	Qampaq ruwasaq.
He is a part of this.	Payqa kaymanta hukninmi.
Why did he come here.	Imaraykutaq kayman hamurqa.
I didn’t think of that.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
Not much to do.	Mana ancha ruwaychu.
He is with us now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
Unfortunately, but it always failed.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwarqa.
There is not much you can do about it.	Chaypaqqa manam anchatachu ruwawaq.
Now I am ready to do that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwanaypaqmi kachkani.
There is a greater good in it.	Aswan hatun allinmi chaypi kachkan.
He talks about it a lot.	Payqa anchatam chaymanta riman.
No, that’s serious.	Manan, chayqa serio hinan.
Like all these other people.	Tukuy kay wakin runakuna hina.
He was a stranger.	Payqa mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
Yes, he is great.	Arí, payqa hatunmi.
Maybe a child.	Ichapas huk wawa.
That’s why it’s ridiculous.	Chayraykum asikunapaq hina.
And just the third one.	Hinaspa chayllaraq kinsa kaq.
One of them stayed there.	Hukninmi chaypi qhepakurqan.
They were there.	Paykunaqa chaypim karqaku.
I know you know how to do this.	Yachanin kay ruwayta yachasqaykita.
But that’s yours.	Ichaqa chaymi qanpa.
That was not what he wanted.	Chayqa manam munasqanman hinachu karqa.
That doesn't make sense.	Chay ruwasqanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He wasn't sure anyone did.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
This made a statement.	Kaymi huk willakuyta ruwarqa.
The time of the injury.	Chay pacha k’irisqa.
Now things looked familiar.	Kunanqa imapas riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
So here’s a guy.	Chaymi kaypi huk wayna.
He’s not crazy.	Payqa manan loco hinachu.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwaytapas ruwananta.
And last summer you were there again.	Hinaspa qayna verano chaypi yapamanta karqanki.
It’s not good, and you’re not good either.	Manam allinchu, qampas manam allinchu kanki.
This is a serious misconduct.	Kayqa hatun mana allin ruwaymi.
But now it was.	Ichaqa kunanmi chayna karqa.
He had to do that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi ruwanan karqa.
What he did with it.	Chaywan ima ruwasqanmanta.
Where he is known.	Maypichus pay riqsisqa kachkan.
Better yet, do it for yourself.	Aswan allinqa, qampaq ruway.
Go all the way.	Tukuy ñanta riy.
You can’t buy anything.	Manam imatapas rantiyta atiwaqchu.
If you know what you want now, that’s great.	Kunan munasqaykita yachanki chayqa, ancha allinmi.
Then three weeks.	Chaymanta kimsa semana.
He knew it was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kasqanta.
This one did, for the first time.	Kayqa ruwarqan, ñawpaq kutita.
I couldn’t get over it.	Manam chaytaqa atipayta atirqanichu.
There is purpose here.	Kaypiqa kanmi imapaqpas.
I tried twice.	Iskay kutitam kallpanchakurqani.
Maybe it’s somewhere.	Ichapas maypipas kachkan.
I never had to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwanay karqachu.
I need it so badly.	Ancha mana allintam necesitasaq.
He couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqachu.
It almost always is.	Yaqa sapa kutim kan.
I don’t want to have to do that.	Manam munanichu chayta ruwanay kasqanmantaqa.
This is especially true in a simple manner.	Chayqa aswan allinmi mana sasa ruwaypi.
I've never done that with anyone.	Manam haykapipas piwanpas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He’s where he wants to be.	Payqa maypichus kayta munan chaypi kachkan.
It was obvious.	Sut’inmi karqan.
But not doing it very well.	Ichaqa mana ancha allintachu ruwaspa.
It is usually about cause and effect.	Yaqa llapanpim imarayku kasqanmanta hinaspa imapas kasqanmanta rimachkan.
A beautiful day.	Huk sumaq punchaw.
You can make them the day before.	Chaykunataqa huk punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwawaq.
Somewhere, maybe he could.	Maypipas, ichapas atinman karqa.
I'll never need it.	Manam haykapipas necesitasaqchu.
There was always something.	Sapa kutim imapas karqa.
I think it might be good for you.	Yuyaykuni, qampaq allin kanman.
He really wanted to believe it.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chayta creeyta.
But she was afraid of him.	Ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan paymanta.
He could do quite well there.	Chaypiqa allintam allinta ruwayta atinman karqa.
The new one isn’t.	Musuq kaqmi mana.
I don’t have it either.	Manam ñuqapas kanchu.
They are really talented people.	Paykunaqa chiqap yachaysapa runakunam kanku.
I’ll be there tomorrow.	Paqarinmi chaypi kasaq.
He thought like a boy, alone.	Payqa wayna hina, sapallanmi yuyaykurqan.
That is why they are so good at it.	Chayraykum paykunaqa chay ruwaypi ancha allin kanku.
It sure looks like it though.	Seguro rikchakun chayman hina ichaqa.
The first cold.	Ñawpaq kaq chiri.
People may disagree, but that’s what I think.	Runakunaqa manapaschá acuerdopichu kanku, ichaqa chaytan ñoqaqa yuyaykuni.
I want to do like you.	Qan hina ruwayta munani.
Maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing.	Ichapas mana allin kaqta maskachkani.
I don’t want to do it either.	Manam ñuqapas ruwayta munanichu.
He is not the same person.	Payqa manam kikin runachu.
A beautiful evening.	Huk sumaq ch'isi.
He never knew what happened.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
You are something much, much bigger.	Qamqa imapas ancha, aswan hatunmi kanki.
The best in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan allin.
I feel safe.	Seguro hinam tarikuni.
Do something to improve your performance.	Imatapas ruway aswan allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Please tell me, please.	Ama hina kaspa willaway, ama hina kaspa.
I can’t do that now.	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa ruwaymanchu.
A couple of black people.	Iskay kimsa yana runakuna.
He said he was a man of sound judgment.	Payqa nirqam allin yuyayniyuq runa kasqanmanta.
It was great to have him all that time.	Ancha allinmi karqa chay tukuy tiempo paywan kayqa.
So everything is fine.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allin kachkan.
I've been here all week.	Tukuy semana kaypi kachkani.
I mean, why not?.	Niyta munani, ¿imaraykutaq mana?.
It’s actually worse.	Chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi.
He certainly said that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa nirqan.
I can't do anything else.	Manañam ima ruwaytapas atinichu.
It may not be the only thing.	Manapaschá chayllachu kanman.
For some reason this is never a good thing.	Imaraykupas kayqa manam haykapipas allinchu.
But he could not remember doing so.	Ichaqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu chayta ruwasqanta.
It was quite a crowd.	Chayqa ancha achka runakunam karqa.
But maybe you know? 	Ichaqa, ¿yaqapaschá yachanki?
Maybe he couldn’t walk.	Ichapas mana puriyta atirqachu.
Why, of course it is.	Imarayku, sut’inmi chayna.
He knew he would act accordingly.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayman hina ruwananta.
I don't know how he can stand it.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam aguantayta atinman.
Otherwise, it doesn’t do anything.	Mana chayqa manan ima ruwaytapas ruwanchu.
Tell me what the date is.	Willay ima punchawmi.
That’s a big deal.	Chayqa huk hatun ruwaymi.
But we’re not sure anymore.	Ichaqa manañan segurochu kayku.
He would rather not.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman mana chayta ruwasqanqa.
He thought that was all.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chaylla kasqanmanta.
Newer this time around.	Aswan musuq kay kutipi.
I can certainly talk to him.	Cheqaqtapunin paywan rimayta atiyman.
I don’t want to be like that.	Manam munanichu chayna kayta.
However, I think it is true.	Ichaqa, chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Once again after that.	Huk kutipi chaymanta.
Yes, that would do it.	Arí, chaymi ruwanman.
Either that, or he wanted to know.	Icha chayta, icha payqa yachayta munarqa.
I wonder if he’s scared.	Tapukunitaqmi mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
And that’s all he said.	Hinaspa chaylla nisqa.
I need real food.	Chiqap mikhunata necesitasaq.
More than one, actually.	Aswan hukmanta, chiqaptaqa.
I couldn't believe how easy it was.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna facil kasqanmanta.
We are great.	Hatunmi kanchik.
This could be that one.	Kaymi chay huknin kanman.
More than one thing, in every way.	Hukmanta aswan imapas, tukuy imapipas.
But it just happened.	Ichaqa chaylla pasarqa.
I thought he could but maybe he couldn't.	Yuyarqanim payqa atinman ichaqa ichapas mana atirqachu.
But he was scared.	Ichaqa mancharisqa.
Here, in the city.	Kaypi, llaqtapi.
He couldn’t say no.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu.
That includes some great stuff.	Chayqa wakin hatun imakunatapas chaypim kachkan.
Yesterday was the second time.	Qayna punchawmi iskay kaq kuti karqa.
I got into trouble with that.	Chaywanmi sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
I'll do one.	Hukta ruwasaq.
I want him all to myself.	Payta tukuyta ñuqapaq munani.
They are intelligent.	Paykunaqa yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
He quickly dismissed them.	Payqa usqhayllan chaykunataqa manaña ruwarqanchu.
No one can stop him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta atinmanchu.
It didn't take that long.	Manam chayna unaytachu pasarqa.
I'm really proud of this.	Chiqaptam orgulloso kani kaymanta.
This was very, very difficult.	Kayqa ancha ancha sasam karqa.
It was a beautiful summer morning.	Huk sumaq verano paqarinmi karqan.
He never did that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
I want to be happy and content.	Munani kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa kayta.
Will do it again for sure.	Hukmanta ruwanqa seguro.
But at the time he was.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa paymi karqan.
I can do more.	Astawan ruwayta atiyman.
I did that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqani.
He is more of a morning person.	Payqa aswan paqarin runam.
It was a good night.	Chay tutaqa allinmi karqa.
You make a little minor adjustment.	Huk chikan pisi allichayta ruwanki.
I know you’re hungry.	Yachanim yarqasqa kasqaykita.
This is a little good.	Kayqa huk chikan allinmi.
It has to be done right the first time.	Ñawpaq kutipi allinta ruwana tiyan.
So, there is a little difference here.	Chaymi, kaypiqa huk chikan chikan kachkan.
You were out for a while.	Huk rato hawapi karqanki.
Of course, of course not.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana.
He died a few hours later at a hospital.	Payqa iskay kinsa hora qhepamanmi huk hospitalpi wañupurqan.
That’s what I’m going to do.	Chaytan ruwasaq nispa.
I thought for sure with that.	Chaywanmi seguro piensarqani.
But it is not difficult to do so.	Ichaqa manan sasachu chayta ruwayqa.
This allows him to do whatever he wants.	Chaywanmi munasqanman hina ruwayta atin.
Not sure how it happened.	Mana segurochu imayna pasasqanmanta.
Then he began to work harder.	Chaymantam aswan sasa llamkayta qallaykurqa.
We need to continue to improve it.	Chaytaqa hinallam allinta ruwananchik.
Now there was no one left.	Kunanqa manañam pipas karqachu.
And this, that, this.	Hinaspa kay, chay, kay.
No one could do it.	Manam pipas atirqachu.
Not such an easy thing to do.	Mana chayna facil ruwaychu.
Obviously, it’s too late.	Sut’inmi, ancha tarde.
Fast, very fast.	Utqaylla, ancha utqaylla.
But he was totally serious.	Ichaqa payqa tukuy imamanta serio karqan.
Was that always the case? 	¿Sapa kutichu chhayna karqan?
Unfortunately, this almost never worked out.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa yaqa mana haykapipas allinchu karqa.
And here it was again.	Hinaspa kaypi yapamanta kasqa.
I'd rather have him out there.	Aswan allinmi kanman payta chay hawapi kananpaq.
But it will be later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi kanqa.
These two were very tough people.	Chay iskay runakunaqa ancha sinchi runakunam karqaku.
I'm always really tired.	Sapa kutim chiqap sayk'usqa kani.
The best thing you’ve ever wanted.	Aswan allin kaqta hayk’aqpas munasqaykita.
But more importantly, it’s a big deal.	Ichaqa aswan allinqa hatun ruwaymi.
I am a traveler.	Ñuqaqa huk puriq runam kani.
He now really knows what he wants.	Payqa kunanqa cheqaqtapunin yachan ima munasqanmanta.
But it’s really hard to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa ruwayqa.
That one, however .	Chay hukninmi ichaqa .
She couldn't understand what had happened to her.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imachus paywan pasasqanmanta.
One of them was hunger.	Hukninmi karqa yarqaymanta.
They were still there.	Paykunaqa hinallam karqaku.
He wasn't sure why he was there.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imarayku chaypi kasqanmanta.
I immediately went there.	Chayllam chayman rirqani.
Young man, you are beautiful.	Wayna, sumaqmi kanki.
She said she felt uncomfortable.	Payqa mana allinchu sientekusqanmanta nirqa.
Now I have no choice.	Kunanqa manañam ima ruwaytapas atinichu.
Being a future human being.	Hamuq pacha runa kay.
I can’t stay here with you.	Manan kaypiqa qanwan qhepakuyta atiymanchu.
He is not that good.	Payqa manam chayna allinchu.
They want to be caught.	Paykunaqa hapisqa kaytam munanku.
It went very well.	Ancha allintam rirqa.
The first was that he could work.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan llank’ayta atisqanmanta.
Else, .	Mana chayqa, .
Like ten years ago.	Chunka wata ñawpaqta hina.
He couldn't tell her anything, not yet.	Manas imatapas willayta atirqachu, manaraqmi.
They probably agreed with that.	Chaywanmi yaqapaschá acuerdopi karqanku.
I hear it all the time.	Sapa kutim uyarini.
Everyone is everything.	Tukuy runa tukuy ima.
What is the most important thing.	Imataq aswan ñawpaqpi kachkan.
First, he was a human being.	Ñawpaqtaqa runam karqa.
It didn’t do much of anything.	Manam anchatachu imatapas ruwarqa.
I hesitate to be absolutely sure about it.	Iskayrayani chaymanta tukuy imamanta seguro kanaypaq.
That’s what he’s doing.	Chaytan ruwashan.
This is part of that.	Kayqa chaymanta hukninmi.
You know, again.	Yachanki, yapamanta.
But, as always.	Ichaqa, sapa kuti hina.
He was fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi kasqa.
He is doing everything on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi tukuy imata ruwachkan.
Not as bad as you are.	Mana qam hinachu sinchi millay.
I saw that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi rikurqani.
There is something you can do about it.	Chaypaqqa kanmi imatapas ruwanaykipaq.
No one wants to know.	Manam pipas yachayta munanchu.
More often than not, I feel ugly about being pretty.	Aswan sapa kutim millay tarikuni sumaq rikchayniyuq kaymanta.
A foolish young man.	Mana yuyayniyuq wayna.
Do it consistently and consistently.	Sapa kutilla ruway hinaspa sapa kutilla ruway.
As now, he will be human.	Kunan hina, payqa runa kanqa.
I know better, you know .	Aswan allinta yachani, yachanki .
I couldn’t say that anymore.	Manañan chayta niyta atirqanichu.
I wonder about this.	Kaymanta tapukuni.
He seems to be alone in the world.	Payqa sapallan hinam kay pachapi.
You know exactly where it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki maypi kasqanmanta.
He said goodnight.	Payqa allin tuta nispas nisqa.
It was who he was supposed to be.	Chayqa karqan pichus kanan karqan.
It was the most wonderful day!.	¡Aswan sumaq punchawmi karqa!.
Unless it was me or that.	Manachus ñuqa utaq chay karqani chayqa.
Repeat this again and again.	Kayta yapamanta yapamanta ruway.
The task would never be so difficult again.	Chay ruwayqa manañan hayk’aqpas chay hina sasachu kanman karqan.
You tell me what happened.	Qanmi willaway imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I feel strongly about doing this.	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa sinchitan sientekuni.
I know where that is.	Yachanim maypi chay kasqanmanta.
Tough time, really.	Sinchi pacha, chiqap.
And now he was angry.	Hinaspa kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.
I hope the best for him.	Suyachkani aswan allin kaqta paypaq.
But I’m not sure he did.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Actually I do.	Chiqaptaqa ruwani.
But that was not the truth.	Ichaqa manan chay cheqaqchu karqan.
Everything about this is beautiful.	Kaymanta tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Do the work again.	Yapamanta llamkayta ruway.
I didn’t want to eat it.	Manam mikhuyta munarqanichu.
I didn’t want him to win.	Manam munarqanichu atipananta.
I know how to swim.	Nadayta yachani.
I want to go outside.	Hawaman lluqsiyta munani.
But now it is very difficult.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha sasam.
The truth is, there is no such person.	Chiqap kaqmi, manam chayna runaqa kanchu.
I think that was last summer.	Chayqa qayna verano kasqanmantam piensani.
Tom couldn't believe it.	Tomqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
That’s not good you know.	Chayqa manan allinchu yachanki.
You know it's there.	Yachankim chaypi kasqanmanta.
That’s exactly what he did.	Chaytan payqa cheqaqtapuni ruwarqan.
What does he eat.	Ima mikun.
No, it was the same person.	Manan, kikin runan karqan.
Scared but ready.	Mancharisqa ichaqa listo.
It was terribly cold.	Ancha millay chiri karqa.
Before or after.	Ñawpaq utaq qhipa.
I have to be me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqa kanan tiyan.
Not good about it, anyway.	Mana allinchu chaymanta, imayna kaptinpas.
Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it.	Llakikuypaqmi chaymantaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
But if you can’t talk about it, you can’t.	Ichaqa manan chaymanta rimayta atiwaqchu chayqa, manan atiwaqchu.
This is the best way.	Kaytaqa aswan allinmi.
This may not be so simple.	Kayqa manapaschá chayna facilchu kanman.
As always, .	Sapa kuti hina, .
Not just that, either.	Mana chayllachu, nitaq.
And then, again, probably not.	Hinaspa chaymanta, yapamanta, manapaschá.
He could never say so much.	Chayna achkatam mana haykapipas niyta atirqachu.
But he couldn't go.	Ichaqa manam riyta atirqachu.
They disagreed about that.	Chaymantaqa manam acuerdopichu karqaku.
But it wasn’t really very funny.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu ancha asikunapaq hina karqan.
The key is to do something alone.	Chaypaqqa sapallan imatapas ruwaymi.
This, folks, is why the world is awesome.	Kay, runakuna, imaraykutaq kay pacha manchay kachkan.
And with me.	Hinaspa ñuqawan.
That’s what I’m looking forward to.	Chaytam suyachkani.
It was the best thing in the world.	Chayqa kay pachapi aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
Before, there was nothing.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam imapas karqachu.
And here it is now.	Hinaspa kaypi kunan kachkan.
You said it didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu nispam nirqanki.
You've been doing it all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chayta ruwachkanki.
He still wasn't sure.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasharqan.
I just said something about it.	Chayllaraqmi chaymantaqa imatapas nirqani.
There’s nothing worse.	Manan imapas aswan mana allinqa.
Surely everyone will come.	Cheqaqtapunin llapa runa hamunqa.
And so do you.	Hinaspa chaynata qam.
He was wrong about it.	Payqa pantasqa kasqa chaymanta.
Everything is nice though.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi ichaqa.
It didn’t exist before.	Manaraqmi ñawpaqtaqa karqanchu.
But for some reason about a week ago.	Ichaqa imaraykupas yaqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
This was not the case today.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Do this, do that, do something else.	Kayta ruway, chayta ruway, hukta ruway.
Hidden people.	Pakasqa runakuna.
Do what you want, what you want.	Munasqaykita, munasqaykita ruway.
People are there.	Runakunaqa kachkanku.
that was his name.	chaymi sutin karqa.
He left looking very sad.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa hinan ripurqan.
Tell me things.	Imakunatapas willaway.
I just did that recently.	Chaytaqa chayllaraqmi ruwarqani.
Tomorrow, you’ll be useless.	Paqarin, mana imapaqpas kanki.
And he was so crazy.	Hinaspa payqa ancha loco kasqa.
And they mean it.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munanku.
But you wouldn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munawaqchu.
He talked about it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chaymanta rimaq.
This is not like him.	Kayqa manam pay hinachu.
Maybe you want to see him.	Ichapas payta qawayta munanki.
Something really great.	Imapas chiqap hatun.
They’re kind of.	Paykunaqa huk laya.
Now, tell me where you are.	Kunanqa, willaway maypi kasqaykita.
Yes, he was too easy.	Arí, payqa llumpay facilmi karqa.
Actually no, it will be long gone.	Chiqaptaqa manam, unayñam manaña kanqachu.
Unlike, maybe not as much as here.	Mana hinachu, ichapas mana kaypi hinachu.
So he would do that all the time.	Chaymi chayta ruwanman sapa kutilla.
He took a good look at her.	Payqa allintan payta qhawarirqan.
I sure don’t want to do that again this year.	Seguro mana munanichu chayta ruwayta kay wata yapamanta.
This was a new low.	Kayqa musuq pisi karqa.
So much trouble.	Chayna achka sasachakuy.
That failed last time.	Chayqa qhipa kutipi mana atirqachu.
I did a lot of that.	Chaytaqa anchatam ruwarqani.
It was almost immediate.	Yaqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
Last chance, now or never.	Qhipa chansa, kunan utaq mana hayk’aqpas.
He went to his house.	Wasinman rirqa.
Now he stayed home all this time.	Kunanqa tukuy chay tiempon wasinpi qhepakurqan.
He knew he was in the hospital.	Payqa yacharqanmi hospitalpi kashasqanmanta.
But he was busy today.	Ichaqa kunan p’unchaymi ocupasqa kasharqan.
I wonder what will happen to him.	Tapukunitaqmi imataq paywan kanqa nispa.
It was ridiculous, he knew.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa, chaytam yacharqa.
The first time.	Ñawpaq kuti.
It went pretty well.	Allin allintam rirqa.
It was two later.	Iskay qhepamanmi karqan.
That’s all there is to it today.	Chayllam kunan punchawqa.
It’s not here though.	Manam kaypichu ichaqa.
I didn’t know why not.	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa mana chaytaqa.
Angry and angry.	Phiñasqa hinaspa phiñasqa.
I wasn’t quite ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manan allintachu listo karqani.
He wasn't going to be here long.	Payqa manan unaytachu kaypi kanan karqan.
That does a couple of things.	Chayqa huk iskay ruwaykunata ruwan.
Maybe there was no reason.	Ichapas mana imaraykupas karqachu.
Something isn’t there.	Imapas mana chaypichu.
There is always something else to do.	Sapa kutim huk ruway kachkan.
You can never be a terrible person.	Manan hayk’aqpas manchay runa kayta atiwaqchu.
That was fine, but it worked.	Chayqa allinmi karqa, ichaqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
He died a month later.	Payqa huk killa qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
But most importantly, do what you love.	Ichaqa aswan allinqa, munasqaykita ruway.
I feel better about myself.	Aswan allintam tarikuni.
He was there the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chaypi kasharqan.
You don’t know who you are.	Manan yachankichu pichus kasqaykita.
It’s not even worth it.	Manan ni imapaqpas valenchu.
I know what it is.	Yachanim imakuna kasqanmanta.
It’s all good to have me here.	Tukuy ima allinmi kaypi ñuqawan kayqa.
Not a big deal though.	Mana hatun ruwaychu ichaqa.
Never mind that.	Ama hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa.
I thought you wouldn’t.	Mana chayta ruwanaykipaqmi yuyaykurqani.
So he did the job.	Chaymi llamkayta ruwarqa.
I don’t agree with it.	Mana acuerdopichu kani.
If he had to go.	Sichus pay rinan karqan chayqa.
I want to play it again and again.	Chaytaqa yapamanta yapamanta tocayta munani.
But he’s too busy and tired.	Ichaqa nishuta ocupasqa, sayk’usqa ima kashan.
Then again, you may never want to leave.	Chaymanta yapamanta, manapaschá hayk’aqpas ripuyta munankichu.
First time home.	Ñawpaq kuti wasiman.
I didn’t see how anyone couldn’t be this.	Mana rikurqanichu imaynatachus pipas mana kayta atirqanchu.
The thing about you.	Qanmanta kaq.
So it’s very easy to do.	Chaymi ancha facil ruwayqa.
Whether he can or not.	¿Atinmanchu icha manachu.
The greatest truth of all.	Tukuy imamanta aswan hatun chiqap.
He’s afraid of it.	Payqa manchakunmi.
I know how to do it.	Yachanim imayna ruwayta.
I don't really like it there.	Chaypiqa manam anchatachu gustan.
That was obvious, of course.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan, cheqaqtapunin.
I feel really great.	Chiqamanta anchata sientekuni.
I didn’t know what to do with him.	Manam yacharqanichu paywan ima ruwanayta.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Manam yachanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
This was what this was.	Kaymi karqan kayqa.
I don’t want to do this walk again.	Manam hukmanta kay puriyta ruwayta munanichu.
He was a newness.	Payqa musuq kaymi karqa.
So anyway, there it is all.	Chaymi imayna kaptinpas, chaypim tukuy ima kachkan.
I can't handle it right now anyway.	Manam kunanqa allintachu manejayta atiyman imayna kaptinpas.
Same, same, more same.	Kikin, kikin, aswan kikin.
And that’s what he was so scared of.	Hinaspa chaymi anchata mancharisqa.
He is always there.	Payqa sapa kutim kachkan.
It will be summer time.	Verano tiempo kanqa.
I mean, it was here.	Niyta munani, kaypim karqa.
He knew he could succeed.	Payqa yacharqanmi allinta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Yes, that would be obvious.	Arí, chayqa sut’inmi kanman.
He never did anything to anyone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas pitapas imatapas ruwarqanchu.
This is a.	Kayqa huk.
I wasn’t always this great, you know.	Manam sapa kutichu kay hatun karqani, yachanki.
He’s better than me in that car, actually.	Payqa aswan allinmi ñuqamanta chay carropi, chiqaptaqa.
I certainly did that.	Chiqaptam chaytaqa ruwarqani.
Fast, but very accurate.	Utqaylla, ichaqa ancha chiqap.
I knew that that night.	Chay tutaqa chaynatam yacharqani.
He wants to come here.	Payqa kayman hamuyta munan.
I’m better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kani.
He certainly didn’t need her to rush things.	Cheqaqtapunin mana necesitarqanchu imatapas usqhaylla ruwananta.
He had no idea anyone knew.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu pipas yachasqanmanta.
I am here every day.	Sapa punchawmi kaypi kachkani.
But he could say nothing more.	Ichaqa manan imatapas astawan rimayta atirqanchu.
But, that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa, chayqa unayñan karqan.
This made him feel sad.	Chaywanmi llakisqa tarikurqa.
But it happened today.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi pasarqa.
Unfortunately, this is often true.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa sapa kutim chiqap.
I don't agree you know.	Manam acuerdopichu kani yachasqaykita.
This is very shortsighted.	Kayqa ancha pisi yuyayniyuqmi.
Humans are like that.	Runakunaqa chayna kanchik.
I wish I could have done this last year.	Munaymanmi kayta qayna wata ruwayman karqan.
But he’s not alone here.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kaypi kashan.
It was cold and wet.	Chayqa chiri, chiri ima kasqa.
I mean, what do I mean.	Niyta munani, imatataq niyta munani.
No, it’s very nice.	Manan, ancha sumaqmi.
This wasn’t good enough for him.	Kayqa manan allinchu karqan paypaq.
Of course, they were.	Chiqamanta, paykunaqa karqanku.
Yes, he was good.	Arí, payqa allinmi kasqa.
This is doubly crazy.	Kayqa iskay kutita loco.
You are always very busy.	Sapa kutim ancha ocupasqa kanki.
I’m a very human person.	Ñuqaqa ancha runam kani.
That's a while ago.	Chayqa huk rato ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Now, the food.	Kunanqa, mikhuy.
But he certainly didn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
They are wrong.	Paykunaqa pantasqa kachkanku.
It probably doesn’t matter.	Manapaschá imananpaschu.
Now we are together for the first time.	Kunanqa ñawpaq kutitam kuska kachkaniku.
But now he couldn’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa manañan atirqanchu.
And somebody has to do it.	Hinaspa wakin runaqa ruwanan.
It would be better for you.	Aswan allinmi kanman qampaq.
It’s not that easy to be me.	Manam chayna facilchu ñuqa kayqa.
There are such people.	Chayna runakunam kan.
Otherwise, you will fail.	Mana chayqa, mana allintachu ruwanki.
But no one could hear him.	Ichaqa manan pipas uyariyta atirqanchu.
There is nothing like this.	Manan imapas kay hinaqa kanchu.
There was plenty of time for that.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon karqan.
We cannot know whether this will happen.	Chayna kananta mana yachayta atichwanchu.
He doesn’t want to see her.	Payqa manan munanchu rikuyta.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu chayqa.
He began to help her.	Paymi yanapayta qallaykurqa.
But it’s not much better than nothing.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu mana imamantapas.
Usually someone twice a week.	Yaqa llapanpim semanapi iskay kutipi pipas.
He noticed her.	Payqa repararqanmi payta.
And then we did, pretty much.	Hinaspa chaymanta ruwarqayku, yaqapaschá.
He never knew who would be next.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu pikuna qhepaman kananta.
Now it makes no sense.	Kunanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
That was always what he wanted.	Chayqa sapa kutim munasqanman hina karqa.
He wanted to talk.	Payqa rimayta munarqanmi.
He did great things the year before.	Chay wata ñawpaqtaqa hatun ruwaykunata ruwarqan.
I’m not a real person.	Manam chiqap runachu kani.
We had a party that night.	Chay tutan fiestata ruwarqayku.
He wants to win every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi atipayta munan.
The very great thing'	Ancha hatun kaq'.
Pretending nothing was wrong, everything was fine.	Mana imapas mana allinchu hina ruwayqa, tukuy imapas allinmi karqan.
He hopes it won't happen immediately.	Payqa suyanmi mana chayllachu kananta.
So, you do what you want with it.	Chaymi, chaywan ima munasqaykita ruwanki.
But for some reason he couldn't say that.	Ichaqa imaraykupas manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.
That should be difficult.	Chayqa sasam kanan.
We have no idea what will happen.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanchik imakuna pasananta.
He has something.	Payqa imapas kanmi.
Such a beautiful, strong, strong man.	Chayna sumaq, sinchi, sinchi runa.
Terribly sad, you know.	Manchay llakisqa, yachanki.
It doesn’t mean anything, really.	Mana ima niyta munanchu, chiqamanta.
Maybe it should be me.	Ichapas ñuqa kanan.
They are human beings, after all.	Paykunaqa runan kanku, tukuy imamanta.
He always knew how hard it was.	Payqa sapa kutim yacharqa imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
And then the adult.	Hinaspa chaymanta hatun runa.
I still don't like it.	Kunankamapas manam gustanchu.
I want to know about everything.	Tukuy imamanta yachayta munani.
Hard to say how new it is.	Sasa niy imayna musuq kasqanmanta.
He is one of them.	Payqa hukninmi.
What was that about.	Imamantataq chay karqa.
Maybe it will come in handy.	Ichapas allinpaq hamunqa.
He was the real thing.	Payqa cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Almost no one knows why anymore.	Yaqapaschá manaña pipas yachanchu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
It had to be somewhere.	Maypipas kanan karqa.
You'll be all day tomorrow.	Paqarin tukuy punchawmi kanki.
About two or three were injured.	Yaqa iskay kimsa hinam k’irisqa karqaku.
But I never saw him.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa rikurqanichu.
I plan to repeat this several times.	Askha kutita kayta yapamanta ruwayta yuyaykuni.
This made it go better.	Kaymi aswan allinta rinanpaq ruwarqa.
So it doesn’t matter.	Chaymi mana imananpaschu.
Sure enough, he got it.	Seguro, payqa chaytan chaskirqan.
He was very tired and cold.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa, chiri ima kasqa.
It was about three months ago.	Yaqa kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
Please make your way there now.	Ama hina kaspa kunan chayman ñanta ruway.
Here it is again for your convenience.	Kaypi yapamanta kachkan qampaq allin kananpaq.
That kind of stuff.	Chay laya imakuna.
You are a human being.	Qamqa huk runam kanki.
You are always with him or me.	Sapa kutim paywan utaq ñuqawan kanki.
They always know how to do it.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim yachanku imayna ruwayta.
Less than one.	Hukmanta pisi.
Never is anyone else.	Mana hayk’aqpas huk runaqa.
It’s better there.	Aswan allinmi chaypiqa.
I don't want to see him do this.	Manam munanichu kayna ruwasqanta qawayta.
Now he was alone in the house.	Kunanqa sapallanmi chay wasipi kasqa.
He doesn’t want to.	Manam munanchu.
Probably never again.	Yaqapaschá manaña hayk’aqpas.
Maybe it was just a little quick.	Ichapas chayllaraq huk chikan utqaylla karqa.
So this statement makes no sense.	Chaymi kay nisqanqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Do something here.	Kaypi imatapas ruway.
He told me it would be better.	Paymi niwarqa aswan allin kananta.
But it looks very familiar.	Ichaqa ancha riqsisqa hinam rikchakun.
That this is true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
That is always a good thing.	Sapa kutim chayqa allin kaq.
But he knew what it was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imachus kasqanta.
It can always be the case.	Sapa kutim chayna kanman.
Probably the name, who they were, that they were there.	Yaqapaschá sutin, pikuna karqanku, chaypi kasqankuta.
No one really knew anything.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu imatapas yacharqan.
It is still a beautiful day.	Kunankamapas sumaq punchawmi kachkan.
Everything is handled perfectly.	Tukuy imapas allintam hapisqa kachkan.
I want to be positive.	Allin yuyayniyuq kaytam munani.
It’s probably the same.	Yaqapaschá chayna.
You, in fact.	Qamqa, chiqaptaqa.
I can’t say that.	Manam chaytaqa rimayta atiymanchu.
I would be bigger.	Aswan hatunmi kayman.
I didn’t know it was going to be a problem.	Manam yacharqanichu sasachakuy kananta.
He was really hurt.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa karqan.
There was someone there.	Chaypim pipas karqa.
I’m pretty sure of that.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa seguro kani.
It obviously doesn’t.	Sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwan.
She had him here now.	Payqa kunan kaypi payta hap’irqan.
Funny coming from him.	Asikunapaq hina paymanta hamuq.
It can be bad, it can be good.	Mana allin kanman, allin kanman.
He’s crazy, crazy, stupid.	Payqa loco, loco, sonso.
One year, then another year.	Huk wata, chaymanta huk wata.
I’m not there for you.	Manam chaypichu kani.
It was almost always the best.	Yaqa sapa kutim aswan allin kaq karqa.
I’m always hungry and tired.	Sapa kutim yarqaymanta sayk’usqa kani.
He looked a little nervous.	Payqa huk chhikanta mancharisqa qhawarisqa.
I wanted everything.	Tukuy imatam munarqani.
There is no last word.	Qhipa rimayqa manam kanchu.
So yes, I don’t.	Chaymi arí, mana.
I want the money.	Qolqetan munani.
We did some strange things.	Wakin mana riqsisqa ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
It’s really the best!.	¡Chiqamanta aswan allin!.
It was the same girl.	Chay kikin sipasmi kasqa.
But it would have been later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi kanman karqan.
You want to do it right.	Allintam ruwayta munanki.
Yes, that’s what you did.	Arí, chaymi ruwarqanki.
Everything is wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinmi.
People are very ambitious.	Runakunaqa anchatam imatapas ruwayta munanku.
It would be nice to be outside.	Allinmi kanman hawapi kayqa.
He really wanted that for her.	Payqa anchatan chayta paypaq munarqan.
But this is not the whole truth.	Ichaqa manan kayqa llapan cheqaqchu.
It was really, really awesome.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta manchay karqa.
This seems less effective.	Kayqa mana ancha allin ruwaq hinam.
I know that you are.	Yachanim chayna kasqaykita.
Be smart, man.	Yuyayniyuq kay, runa.
Tell them all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta willay.
But sad is good.	Ichaqa llakisqa allinmi.
It's a little hard to say now.	Kunanqa huk chikan sasam niyta.
That’s what he didn’t want.	Chaytan payqa mana munarqanchu.
No, he doesn’t care.	Manan, payqa manan imananpaschu.
Things were not right after all.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa tukuy imamanta.
Is that a good thing?.	¿Chayqa allinchu?.
He said the same thing again.	Chaynatam yapamanta nirqa.
He told me he was ready.	Payqa niwarqanmi listo kashasqanmanta.
It is the right thing to do.	Allin kaqta ruwaymi.
It doesn’t go well.	Mana allintachu rin.
He was lucky to win.	Payqa suerteyoqmi karqan atipananpaq.
But it was the way it was.	Ichaqa chayna hinam karqa.
There is really nothing to this.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas kaymantaqa kanchu.
It will be like a day.	Chayqa huk punchaw hinam kanqa.
But this came along.	Ichaqa kaymi hamurqan.
So, there’s something bigger.	Chaymi, aswan hatunmi kan.
Night before and after.	Tuta ñawpaq qhipa.
The first settler.	Ñawpaq tiyaq runa.
So the more the better.	Chaymi aswan achka kaptinqa aswan allinqa.
That meant he liked her.	Chayqa niyta munarqa pay gustasqanmanta.
He wasn’t good enough.	Payqa manan allinchu kasqa.
And now it doesn’t matter.	Hinaspa kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
Very, very angry.	Ancha ancha phiñasqa.
I thought that would be easy.	Chayqa facilmi kananta piensarqani.
He couldn’t take it.	Payqa manan chayta hap’iyta atirqanchu.
This is a great one to make from scratch.	Kayqa hatunmi mana imamanta ruwanapaq.
I know you’re not good enough.	Yachanim mana allin kasqaykita.
That’s what he wants.	Chaynatam payqa munan.
That’s the new thing.	Chayqa musuq kaqmi.
Please send a .	Ama hina kaspa huk .
You’re either there or you’re not.	Chaypin kashanki icha manachu.
That’s something .	Chayqa imapas .
Thanks great guy!.	Gracias hatun runa!.
I thought that was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
We don’t always agree.	Manam sapa kutichu acuerdopi kanchik.
And it’s one of them.	Hinaspa hukninmi.
They are all wrong.	Llapallankum pantasqa kachkanku.
That doesn’t know anything.	Chayqa mana imatapas yachanchu.
But there is something worse.	Ichaqa kanmi aswan mana allinqa.
And so, that’s a good thing.	Hinaspa chayna, chayqa allinmi.
It’s probably me.	Yaqapaschá ñoqaqa kani.
And then it wasn't, at least outside.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana karqachu, aswanpas hawapi.
Either way, it would be better.	Imayna kaptinpas, aswan allinmi kanman.
He is a very depressed man.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa runan.
I was, after all, human.	Ñuqaqa karqani, tukuy imamanta, runa.
Now that is unfortunate.	Kunanqa chayqa llakikuypaqmi.
Soon you will be doing it on your own.	Pisi tiempollamantan sapallayki chayta ruwanki.
I wish it never happened.	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas kananpaq.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
Obviously, it is .	Sut’inmi kashan, chaymi .
Being that way.	Chayna kaspa.
An older building, then.	Huk kuraq wasi, chaymanta.
Really good actually.	Chiqamanta allin chiqamanta.
And a good teacher.	Hinaspa allin yachachiq.
That’s what I did this year.	Chaytan kay wata ruwarqani.
Here, it’s not.	Kaypiqa, mana.
Is it right or wrong?.	¿Allinchu icha mana allinchu?.
He was lucky, she knew.	Payqa suerteyoqmi karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
That’s a very sad thing! 	¡Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi!
I'm really proud of it.	Chiqaptam chaymanta orgulloso kani.
So evil can barely walk.	Chaymi mana allinqa yaqapaschá puriyta atin.
This is beyond what anyone could ever imagine.	Kayqa pipas hayk’aqpas yuyaykusqanmanta aswan hatunmi.
They are the	Paykunaqa chay .
I thought he must be home.	Yuyarqanim wasinpi kananta.
It does just about everything right.	Yaqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwan.
He wanted to say that but he couldn't.	Chayta niyta munarqa ichaqa manam atirqachu.
It’s just like him.	Pay hinallam.
I don’t know which year.	Mana yachanichu mayqin wata.
It’s just, you know .	Chaylla, yachanki .
Really good people.	Chiqap allin runakuna.
And then, nothing for a year.	Hinaspa chaymanta, mana imapas huk wata.
Not like you, anyway.	Mana qam hinachu, imayna kaptinpas.
He was certainly wrong.	Cheqaqtapunin pantasqa rimarqan.
I'm still happy, actually.	Kunankamapas kusisqam kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe it needs a new fix.	Ichapas huk musuq allichayta necesitan.
And then the day before.	Hinaspa chaymanta ñawpaq p’unchaw.
He said something about it being a bad day.	Payqa imatapas nirqam mana allin punchaw kasqanmanta.
He couldn't hold it.	Manas hap'iyta atirqanchu.
Therein lies the first problem.	Chaypin kashan ñawpaq kaq sasachakuy.
Nothing to hurry up.	Mana imapas utqaylla kananpaq.
No one can tell the truth.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu rimayta atinman.
What did you do with it.	Imatataq ruwarqanki.
That sounds like a nice thing to do.	Chayqa sumaq ruway hinam uyarikun.
Probably hard, say .	Yaqapaschá sasa, niy .
You always know what the current version is.	Sapa kuti yachanki ima kunan kaq laya kasqanmanta.
However, that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.	Ichaqa, chayqa manas maymanpas rinanpaq hinachu.
But that should be the reality.	Ichaqa chaymi cheqaq kaq kanan.
Someone was here, he said.	Pipas kaypi kasqa, nispas nin.
That happened on its own.	Chayqa sapallanmi pasarqa.
I still don't feel great enough.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu hatun sientekuni.
I’ll be serious now.	Kunanqa serio kasaq.
Faster and faster.	Aswan utqaylla aswan utqaylla.
What's with it.	Imataq chaywan kachkan.
Say the first thing.	Ñawpaq kaqta niy.
There is always someone who does it better.	Sapa kutim kan pipas aswan allin ruwaq.
It was something like that.	Chayqa imapas chayna kaqmi karqa.
That was the worst part of it.	Chayqa chaymanta aswan mana allin kaqmi karqa.
The greater good.	Aswan hatun allin.
Scarier, perhaps.	Aswan manchay, ichapas.
That’s what we had to do.	Chaynatam ruwananchik karqa.
I need this today.	Kunan punchawmi kayta necesitasaq.
I think this sounds like a good one.	Ñuqaqa piensani kayqa allin hina uyarikun.
We cannot fix everything today.	Kunan punchawqa manam tukuy imatapas allichayta atichwanchu.
He wanted to do some solo work.	Payqa wakin sapallan llamk’ayta ruwayta munarqan.
I would do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayman.
And one today.	Hinaspa huk kunan punchaw.
I don’t know for sure right now.	Kunanqa manan allintachu yachani.
He couldn’t remember.	Manam yuyariyta atirqachu.
So we walked and talked together.	Chaymi kuska puriq kayku rimaq kayku.
He said it would be another time.	Huk kutipi kananta nirqa.
But he didn’t buy it well.	Ichaqa manan allintachu rantirqan.
Maybe they’re there, maybe they’re not.	Ichapas chaypi kachkanku, ichapas mana.
And this, he does better.	Hinaspa kay, payqa aswan allinta ruwan.
Which was a very big deal.	Imataq ancha hatun karqa.
He no longer looked down on her.	Payqa manañan mana allintachu qhawarirqan.
The man was clearly disappointed.	Chay runaqa sut’inmi hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
So that’s the way it is.	Chaymi chhayna kashan.
But you can’t ignore that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa mana uyariyta atiwaqchu.
Here are some…	Kaypi wakin...
I was always busy.	Sapa kutim ocupasqa karqani.
But he knows it’s good.	Ichaqa yachanmi allin kasqanmanta.
Everything about it.	Tukuy ima kasqanmanta.
But, he is here.	Ichaqa, payqa kaypim kachkan.
No one there now.	Mana pipas chaypi kunanqa.
It’s not good, yes.	Mana allinmi, arí.
There has to be someone else on the bike.	Bicicletapi huk runa kanan.
I really think he needs it.	Chiqaptam piensani necesitasqanmanta.
I wanted to sleep there.	Chaypi puñuyta munarqani.
It was a morning all about him.	Chayqa karqan huk paqarinmi paymanta tukuy imamanta rimaq.
He can't stand it anymore.	Payqa manañam aguantayta atinchu.
But this he could not know.	Ichaqa kaytan mana yachayta atirqanchu.
Everything was fine here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I thought it was really funny.	Chiqap asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
The people there were very nice.	Chaypi tiyaq runakunaqa ancha allinmi karqanku.
Maybe it happened, maybe not.	Ichapas chayna pasarqa, manapaschá.
This is one of our most popular features.	Kayqa hukninmi aswan riqsisqa ruwasqaykumanta.
That’s going to happen.	Chayqa rin.
I am really excited about it.	Ñuqaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani chaymanta.
Still, he was depressed.	Chayna kaptinpas llakisqa kachkarqa.
Not most of the time, but always.	Mana yaqa llapan kutichu, aswanpas sapa kuti.
So do something about it.	Chaymi imatapas ruway.
That’s the wrong thing.	Chayqa pantasqa kaqmi.
So far you have done well.	Kunankamaqa allintam ruwarqanki.
I feel really bad about this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam mana allintachu sientekuni.
There are people who do that.	Chayta ruwaq runakunam kan.
Time for something.	Imapaqpas pacha.
I have never seen anything like him.	Pay hinaqa manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
Pretty crazy, but crazy.	Allin loco, ichaqa loco.
Unfortunately, he did so too early.	Llakikuypaqmi, llumpay temprano chayta ruwarqa.
If not, then he doesn't really do anything.	Mana chayqa, chaymantaqa manam chiqaptaqa imatapas ruwanchu.
It’s totally wrong.	Tukuy imamanta mana allinchu.
It came alone, again and again.	Sapallanmi hamurqa, yapamanta yapamanta.
Things are better now.	Kunanqa imapas aswan allinmi.
No one could see him.	Manam pipas paytaqa rikuyta atirqachu.
Even if that’s something that isn’t much.	Chayqa imapas mana ancha kaptinpas.
It’s better than one.	Hukmanta aswan allinmi.
He told her not to do anything.	Imapas mana ruwananpaqmi nisqa.
There are a lot of things that can go wrong.	Kanmi achka imakuna mana allinchu kanman.
That’s what he knew now.	Chaynatam kunanqa yacharqa.
Which is a bad guy.	Imataq mana allin ruwaq.
He knew who he was now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan pi kasqanmanta.
One of them might be as follows.	Hukninmi kanman kay hina.
But the name is good.	Ichaqa sutinmi allin.
I am going to do very well.	Ancha allinta ruwanaypaqmi kachkani.
Ultimately, he had no choice.	Qhepamanmi mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I mean .	Niyta munani .
Kind of like all this.	Huk laya tukuy kay hina.
Such a no-brainer.	Chayna mana yuyayniyuq.
Yes, that was a great experience.	Arí, chayqa ancha allinmi karqan.
That’s all, it’s okay .	Chaylla, allinmi .
There is nothing absurd here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana yuyayniyuqchu.
But I could never find the right time.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allin tiempota tariyta atirqanichu.
He doesn’t want to be alone.	Payqa manan munanchu sapallan kayta.
It certainly takes action.	Chaypaqqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwana.
He didn’t know how to do it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna ruwayta.
What, we have no idea.	Ima, mana yuyayniyuqchu kanchik.
That seemed to make the most sense.	Chayqa aswan allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
Last night he was scared.	Qayna tutan mancharisqa kasharqan.
And, man, he's out there.	Hinaspa, runa, payqa hawapi kachkan.
No, it wasn’t bad at all.	Manan, manan imapipas mana allinchu karqan.
You’re a human being, all right.	Qamqa runam kanki, allinmi.
This was the first time.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq kuti.
That's crazy.	Chay loco.
Or do something else.	Utaq imatapas ruway.
I’ve already been here.	Ñam kaypi karqani.
This is very, very good.	Kayqa ancha, ancha allinmi.
Good, intelligent people.	Allin, yuyayniyuq runakuna.
I saw nothing all day.	Tukuy punchawmi mana imatapas rikurqanichu.
He did not know how to solve the problem.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chay sasachakuy allichayta.
They were eventually acquitted.	Qhepamanmi mana huchayoq karqanku.
He can’t do it again.	Manam yapamanta ruwaytaqa atinmanchu.
That wasn’t nearly enough.	Chayqa manan yaqa allinchu karqan.
Now I don’t know what to do.	Kunanqa manan yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
She is eager to find out who he is.	Payqa anchatam munan pi kasqanmanta yachayta.
I’ll be with him shortly.	Pisi tiempollamantan paywan kasaq.
I can do one thing.	Hukta ruwayta atiyman.
Now do what you have to do.	Kunanqa ruwanaykita ruway.
We don’t agree on anything.	Manam imapipas acuerdopichu kayku.
That was a terrible failure.	Chayqa manchay mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
I don’t want that to happen.	Manam munanichu chayna pasananta.
They all had to be.	Llapallankum kanan karqa.
But we did it accordingly.	Ichaqa chayman hina ruwarqayku.
He was a baseball player.	Payqa béisbol nisqapi pukllaqmi karqan.
He was not in a position to speak.	Payqa manan rimananpaq hinachu karqan.
He wanted it, very much.	Payqa munarqanmi, anchata.
But no, it had to be better than that.	Ichaqa manan, chaymanta aswan allin kanan karqan.
Of course, it wasn’t the only thing.	Arí, manan chayllachu karqan.
I look forward to playing it again.	Suyachkani hukmanta tocayta.
Now it’s the only truth.	Kunanqa sapallanmi chiqap.
So now it was.	Chaymi kunanqa karqa.
But I'm pretty sure he's in town.	Ichaqa allintam seguro kani llaqtapi kasqanmanta.
That doesn’t always have to be the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu kanan.
Say, black people.	Niy, yana runakuna.
He was happy to have someone.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan pipas kasqanmanta.
Someone with low intelligence.	Pipas pisi yuyayniyuq.
That’s really, really fast.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap utqaylla.
Actually, that’s not good enough.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa manam allinchu.
He was hurt, badly.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqa, sinchita.
It is faster and faster.	Aswan utqaylla hinaspa aswan utqayllam.
No past, present, or future.	Mana ñawpaq, kunan, hamuq pacha.
He wants a future with me.	Payqa munanmi hamuq tiempopi ñoqawan.
But everything is clear.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas sut’inmi.
Maybe he’s not ready.	Ichapas mana listochu kachkan.
He was so crazy.	Payqa ancha loco kasqa.
I can’t say his name.	Manam sutinta niyta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t wait that long.	Manam chay unayta suyayta atirqanichu.
But I don’t know what this could be.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imachus kay kanman chayta.
But it may be too much time .	Ichaqa yaqapaschá nishuta tiempo kanman .
So here’s what I have.	Chaymi kaypi ñuqapa kachkan.
No one does it now.	Kunanqa manam pipas ruwanchu.
He looked at the money.	Chay qullqita qhawarisqa.
He quickly goes to speak.	Payqa usqhayllan rimananpaq rin.
But it wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa manan chayman hinachu karqan.
He asked me about me.	Paymi tapuwarqa ñuqamanta.
I heard it at home.	Wasipi uyarirqani.
We’ve always done that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaytaqa ruwarqayku.
Here it is not.	Kaypiqa manam.
She desperately wanted to talk to him again.	Payqa sinchitan munarqan hukmanta paywan rimayta.
He certainly was more than enough.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin aswan askha karqan.
And most people, or many people anyway.	Hinaspa yaqa llapan runakuna, utaq achka runakuna imayna kaptinpas.
There it looked like this.	Chaypim kayna rikchakurqa.
And you want to.	Hinaspa munanki.
He knew he couldn't stand it with her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paywan mana aguantayta atisqanmanta.
Somewhere almost.	Maypipas yaqa.
He was probably as bad as a man could be.	Payqa yaqapaschá huk runaqa atisqanman hina millay karqan.
Not worth my time.	Mana tiempoy valenchu.
It didn’t really look like it, but maybe .	Manam chiqaptachu chayna rikchakurqa, ichaqa ichapas .
He said so, but he didn’t really mean it.	Chaytan nirqan, ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa munarqan.
It wouldn’t be the only thing.	Mana chayllachu kanman.
The black one.	Chay yana kaq.
I know this language.	Kay simitaqa yachanin.
No one else, who is better.	Mana pi huk, pi aswan allin.
I don't think it would be right.	Mana allinchu kanman nispaymi piensani.
He didn’t really want to go, he had no intention of going.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu riyta munarqan, manan yuyaykurqanchu rinanpaq.
You know, they know .	Yachanki, paykunaqa yachanku .
I mean it just wasn't there.	Niyta munani chaylla mana chaypichu karqa.
Of course, this is neither here nor there.	Arí, kayqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
I’m not exactly happy.	Manam allintachu kusisqa kachkani.
I thought he was drunk.	Machasqa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
A month, he said.	Huk killa, nispa.
It sounds very good.	Ancha allin uyarikun.
Don’t ever want to come here.	Ama hayk’aqpas kayman hamuyta munanichu.
I want to be with you all the time.	Tukuy tiempo qanwan kayta munani.
But you need to act now.	Ichaqa kunanmi imatapas ruwanayki.
And that’s a good thing, for sure.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi, seguro.
So stop doing that.	Chaymi amaña chayta ruwaychu.
But it wouldn’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanman.
I took a nap.	Huk puñuyta ruwarqani.
He wanted to be friends.	Payqa amigontin kaytan munarqan.
He probably won’t do that.	Payqa manachá chayta ruwanqachu.
If so, you want to quit.	Chayna kaptinqa saqiyta munanki.
The process continues.	Chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
He was happy there.	Chaypin kusisqa kasharqan.
He seemed happy with that.	Chaywanqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
Strong, he meant.	Sinchi, niyta munarqa.
It’s going to be good, it’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa, allinmi kanqa.
That should make for a very cold weekend.	Chayqa huk semana tukuyta ancha chiri kananpaqmi ruwanan.
I thought of it all.	Tukuy chayta yuyaykurqani.
It’s very uncomfortable there.	Ancha mana allinmi chaypiqa.
This makes certain things more efficient.	Chaywanmi wakin ruwaykunata aswan allinta ruwan.
Yes you have to do that.	Arí chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Learn to do nothing.	Mana imatapas ruwaspa ruwayta yachay.
I made coffee with it.	Chaywanmi kukata ruwarqani.
Some people disagree.	Wakin runakunaqa manam acuerdopichu kanku.
Now they are two different things.	Kunanqa iskay chikan imakuna kanku.
I could never walk.	Manam haykapipas puriyta atirqanichu.
You may not know that.	Chaytaqa manapaschá yachankichu.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan mana imananpaschu.
He never quite knew where he was.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yacharqan maypi kashasqanmanta.
I know almost exactly.	Yaqa allintam yachani.
Other than that we are the same player.	Huk chaymantaqa kikin pukllaqmi kanchik.
If he were successful, he wouldn’t do that.	Sichus allinta ruwanman chayqa, manan chayta ruwanmanchu.
It won’t work there now.	Kunanqa manan chaypiqa allinchu kanqa.
It wasn’t good at all.	Manam imapipas allinchu karqa.
I can speak again.	Hukmanta rimayta atiyman.
That means being all human.	Chayqa llapan runa kaymi niyta munan.
I'm not quite sure how to go about this.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam kaymanta risaq.
Now, it’s time.	Kunanqa, pacha.
I am so happy to be a part of it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chaymanta huknin kasqaymanta.
Maybe it was the baby.	Ichapas chay wawa karqa.
Fortunately, there is a simple way to do this.	Ancha kusisqa, kanmi huk sasa ruway kayta ruwanapaq.
I have no idea how we did it.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna ruwasqaykumanta.
That’s something you may not be able to do.	Chayqa manapaschá ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He may never want to go alone.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas sapallan riyta munanmanchu.
Can't say exactly what, or when.	Mana allintachu niyta atin ima, utaq haykapi.
Now, he thinks.	Kunanqa, payqa yuyaykun.
So it’s ridiculous.	Chaymi asikunapaq hina.
This means, you’ll be happier.	Kayqa niyta munan, aswan kusisqa kanki.
But then it would be the same person.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa kikin runan kanman.
You want to make sure you’re okay.	Allin kasqaykita seguro kayta munanki.
Very fast now.	Ancha utqaylla kunan.
I think this is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
Learn what it is.	Ima kasqanmanta yachay.
He could not understand such actions.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu chhayna ruwaykunata.
He couldn't ignore this.	Payqa manan kayta mana uyariyta atirqanchu.
You said it wrong above.	Hawapi mana allintachu nirqanki.
And this is the good thing.	Hinaspa kaymi allinqa.
Being there and being a part of it.	Chaypi kaspa chaymanta huknin kaspa.
Doing so will not be easy.	Chayta ruwayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
I really hope all is well with you.	Chiqamanta suyachkani tukuy ima allin kananpaq qampaq.
He thought he never would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi mana hayk’aqpas ruwananta.
He always wanted to know how she felt.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna sientekusqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
It’s not available anywhere.	Manan maypipas kanchu.
Not good, or not.	Mana allin, icha mana.
I could never understand it.	Manam haykapipas entiendeyta atirqanichu.
It was a foolish thing to do.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqa.
Something big is happening, something important.	Imapas hatun ruwaymi kachkan, imapas ancha allin kaq.
Do you know why that is.	Yachankichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
It took some action.	Wakin ruwayta hap’irqan.
And now they know.	Hinaspa kunanqa yachanku.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manan yacharqanichu.
One was unoccupied.	Hukninmi mana ocupasqa karqa.
Something was terribly wrong in this city.	Imapas manchay mana allinchu karqa kay llaqtapi.
He didn’t want to put up with it.	Payqa manan aguantayta munarqanchu.
He went out to do some things.	Payqa wakin ruwaykunata ruwananpaqmi lluqsirqa.
Be more like him.	Astawan pay hina kay.
Never very good at it though.	Mana hayk’aqpas ancha allintachu chaypi ichaqa.
So, it’s a good walk.	Chaymi, allin puriq.
But what the truth was out there now.	Ichaqa ima cheqaq kaqmi kunanqa hawapi kasharqan.
All now a first.	Tukuy kunan huk ñawpaq kaq.
He knew what she wanted from him.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatachus paymanta munasqanmanta.
And it finally happened this summer.	Hinaspa kay verano tukukuypi pasarqa.
About two weeks ago.	Yaqa iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Something to make him go.	Imapas payta rinanpaq.
I know you are innocent.	Yachanim mana huchayoq kasqaykita.
So, it doesn't seem right.	Chaymi, mana allinchu rikchakun.
This was his man.	Kaymi runan kasqa.
There’s someone here, including me.	Kaypi pipas kachkan, ñuqapas.
Everything is everything.	Tukuy imapas tukuy imapas.
If anyone knows, please let me know.	Pipas yachan chayqa willaway.
We just had to do too much.	Chayllaraqmi llumpayta ruwanayku karqa.
He looked kind of familiar.	Payqa huk laya riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He'd never do that.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqan.
That seems stupid.	Chayqa sonso hinam rikchakun.
He can’t be real.	Payqa manan cheqaq kayta atinmanchu.
This isn’t the case.	Kayqa manam kanchu.
I almost wanted to.	Yaqapaschá munarqani.
First, it can be very difficult.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ancha sasa ruwaymi kanman.
But no one wanted to say anything about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
I can’t bear to hear it.	Manam aguantayta atinichu uyariyta.
He had always been in trouble.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I should have done that immediately.	Chaytaqa chayllam ruwanay kanman karqa.
very many.	ancha achka.
Kind of tired, actually.	Imayna sayk’usqa, chiqamanta.
But the world.	Ichaqa kay pacha.
All terrible people.	Tukuy manchay runakuna.
It doesn’t matter, it never matters.	Manan imananpaschu, manan hayk’aqpas imananpaschu.
I know you did your best.	Yachanim tukuy atisqaykita ruwasqaykita.
I'm cold, tired and depressed.	Chiri, sayk'usqa, llakisqa ima kani.
I can't see it like mine yet.	Manaraqmi ñuqapa hinaqa qawayta atinichu.
Not that bad at all.	Mana chayna mana allinchu ni imapipas.
He was tired, but he still didn't want to sleep.	Sayk'usqa kasqa, ichaqa manaraqmi puñuyta munarqanchu.
New year, new me.	Musuq wata, musuq ñuqa.
You can never be me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqa kayta atiwaqchu.
He probably knew something was going to happen to him.	Yaqapaschá yacharqa imapas paywan pasananta.
After all, these people are really nice.	Tukuy imamanta, kay runakunaqa chiqamanta sumaq kanku.
Now that’s crazy.	Kunanqa chayqa loco.
I can't imagine what's wrong.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I wanted to believe that.	Chayta creeyta munarqani.
But you can’t do that, of course.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu, cheqaqtapunin.
And you’re young.	Hinaspa wayna kanki.
You will have a year to succeed.	Huk wata kanqa allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Unfortunately this was not exactly true.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana allintachu chiqap karqa.
He was very sick.	Payqa ancha unqusqa kasqa.
He probably said it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa nirqan.
There were about ten of them.	Chunka hinam karqaku.
What are you going to do about it.	Imatataq ruwanki chaymanta.
I can’t be sure what he’s going to do.	Manam seguro kayta atiymanchu ima ruwananmanta.
But this will not work.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allintachu ruwanqa.
Again, this needs to be done quickly.	Yapamanta, kayta usqhaylla ruwana tiyan.
So he was her teacher.	Chaymi payqa paypaq yachachiq.
There will be a lot to do.	Achka ruwana kanqa.
Very important, very important.	Ancha importante, ancha importante.
On a bicycle.	Huk bicicletapi.
Do it first thing tomorrow morning.	Paqarin paqarin ñawpaqta ruway.
Of course it doesn’t mean this will be easy.	Chiqamanta mana niyta munanchu kayqa facil kanqa.
So, this is good stuff.	Chaymi, kayqa allin imapas.
They seemed very happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska ancha kusisqa hinam karqaku.
However, it is important to have a positive attitude.	Ichaqa, ancha allinmi allin yuyayniyuq kayqa.
No, not really.	Manam, manam chiqaptachu.
So they’re never real.	Chaymi mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu kanku.
But he did nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa ruwarqanchu.
But then again.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa.
I take that as a challenge.	Chaytaqa huk sasachakuy hinam hapini.
I learned a lot from it.	Chaywanmi achkata yacharqani.
So he was there.	Chaymi payqa chaypi kasqa.
No one seems happier.	Manan pipas aswan kusisqachu rikch’akun.
You can’t catch it either.	Qampas manam hapiyta atiwaqchu.
I really need help.	Anchatan necesitasaq yanapayta.
A child, yes.	Huk wawa, arí.
It’s all up to you.	Lliwmi qammanta kanqa.
So you are safe and sound, after all.	Chaymi seguro hinaspa allin kanki, tukuy imamanta.
You’re doing a very good job.	Ancha allintam ruwanki.
I went that long before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi unayta rirqani.
Please don't say no.	Ama hina kaspa, mana niy.
But it’s not always like this.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu kay hinata.
Almost never being out here of him.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas kaypi paymanta hawapi kasqanmanta.
You were the only one.	Qamqa chayllam karqanki.
Not doing his homework.	Tareankunata mana ruwaspa.
After all, he is human.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa runam.
Rather itself another world.	Aswanpas kikin huk pacha.
No one is easy.	Manan pipas facilchu.
It's not as easy as it seems, you know.	Manam rikchakun hinachu facilchu, yachanki.
I know the solution.	Yachanim chay allichayta.
I know it's not that popular.	Yachanim mana chayna ancha riqsisqa kasqanmanta.
That's how it should be.	Chayna kanan tiyan, nispa.
Everyone seems a little tired.	Lliwmi huk chhikanta sayk’usqa hina kanku.
That was a few days ago.	Chayqa iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
Three months.	Kimsa killa.
It doesn’t matter when.	Manam imananpaschu haykapi.
One teacher is gone.	Huk yachachiqmi manaña kanchu.
They were obviously not good enough.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqanku.
This, perhaps, he says.	Kayta, ichapas, nispas nin.
That sounds like me.	Chayqa ñuqa hinam uyarikun.
They weren’t like him.	Paykunaqa manan pay hinachu karqanku.
If you want to do that, you can probably do that.	Chayta ruwayta munaspaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwawaq.
He wasn't sure what he was himself.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imachus pay kikin kasqanmanta.
He really means well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta niyta munan.
Yes, on the weekend.	Arí, semana tukukuypi.
But first, a little about how.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa, huk chikan imayna kasqanmanta.
But he didn't want to say anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
No, much, much more than that.	Manan, aswan, askha aswan chaymanta.
You can’t convince him.	Manam convencechiyta atiwaqchu.
I don’t want to do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta munanichu.
But it’s easy.	Ichaqa facilmi.
But it was this morning.	Ichaqa kunan paqarinmi karqan.
That happened one day.	Chayqa huk punchawmi pasarqa.
He never seems to do it again.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yapamanta ruwaq hinachu.
But he can’t and won’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu nitaq ruwanqachu.
It was, indeed, a man.	Chayqa karqan, cheqaqtapunin huk runa.
I’m going to go home too.	Ñuqapas wasiyman risaq.
Everything was black again.	Tukuy imapas yapamanta yana kasqa.
Can’t remember the way.	Mana ñanta yuyariyta atinchu.
Not bad there.	Mana mana allinchu chaypi.
That will come later this evening.	Chayqa kunan ch’isi qhepamanmi hamunqa.
The man had a complete sense of humor.	Chay runaqa tukuy imamanta yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqan.
He is talking about it now.	Payqa kunanmi chaymanta rimachkan.
Not half bad.	Mana kuskan mana allinchu.
Now there was nothing left.	Kunanqa manañam imapas karqachu.
One day he started talking to me.	Huk punchawmi ñuqawan rimayta qallaykurqa.
So he doesn’t care.	Chaymi payqa mana imananpaschu.
The following weekend.	Qatiqnin semana tukuyta.
Goodness knows why, but they want to.	Allin kayqa yachanmi imanasqa chayta, ichaqa munanku.
And it actually would be better here.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa kaypiqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t work out what it was.	Payqa manan llank’ayta atirqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
He seemed uncertain.	Payqa mana seguro hinam karqa.
That’s what it means to be human.	Chayqa runa kayqa niyta munan.
You know one is easily caught.	Yachanki huknin facil hapisqa kasqanmanta.
No, that would be great.	Manan, chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
But we’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kayku.
He did nothing with it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaywanqa ruwarqanchu.
He doesn't want anyone to live here.	Payqa manam munanchu kaypi pipas yachananta.
I don’t want that to happen again.	Manam munanichu hukmanta chayna kananta.
Everything else is secondary and irrelevant.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaqmi, mana imapaqpas kaqmi.
He’s young, smart, and angry.	Payqa wayna, yachaysapa, phiñasqa ima.
What should be the process.	Imataq kanan chay ruway.
It’s okay to be a little late.	Allinmi huk chikan tarde kayqa.
There’s plenty of time for that later.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon kan qhepaman.
But this is surprising.	Ichaqa kayqa admirakuypaqmi.
Maybe they really were.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni karqaku.
I can do them very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam chaykunataqa ruwayman.
Everything for me.	Tukuy ima ñuqapaq.
This has happened many times.	Chayqa achka kutitam pasarqa.
The first is uncertainty.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana seguro kay.
I have some really good ideas too.	Ñuqapas wakin chiqap allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He knew he wasn’t under arrest.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hap’isqa kashasqanmanta.
It’s me all the time.	Tukuy tiempon ñoqa kani.
I thought he wouldn’t.	Mana chayta ruwananta yuyaykurqani.
He’s me, guys.	Payqa ñuqam.
All morning home.	Tukuy tutamanta wasiman.
This is not a new practice.	Kayqa manam musuq ruwaychu.
But one thing is constant.	Ichaqa huk kaqmi sapa kutilla.
It doesn’t seem familiar.	Mana riqsisqa hinachu.
It happened for no reason at all.	Chayqa mana imaraykupas, tukuy imaraykupas pasarqa.
It’s not being intelligent.	Manam yuyayniyuq kaychu.
Or maybe the tenth.	Utaq ichapas chunka kaq.
You are now a married man.	Kunanqa casarasqa runam kanki.
That is a wonderful thing to do.	Chayqa ancha sumaq ruwaymi.
He can’t take that chance.	Payqa manan chay oportunidadta hap’iyta atinchu.
They are a difficult task.	Sasa ruwaymi kanku.
Baby, everything was good for you.	Wawa, tukuy imapas allinmi qampaq karqa.
He didn’t need anything.	Payqa manan imatapas necesitarqanchu.
The result would be worse than disappointment.	Chay ruwasqanqa aswan mana allinmi kanman hukmanyasqa kasqanmantaqa.
So about a decade.	Chaymi yaqa chunka wata.
Perhaps someone would speak.	Yaqapaschá pipas rimaq.
I know he is tough.	Yachanim payqa sinchi kasqanmanta.
Of course, there is the unhappy truth.	Arí, kanmi mana kusisqa cheqaq kaq.
No idea what that might be.	Mana yuyayniyuq imachus chay kanman chayta.
Such an approach is somewhat surprising.	Chayna ruwayqa huk rato admirakuypaqmi.
Maybe it meant something and maybe it didn’t.	Ichapas imapas niyta munarqa ichapas mana.
They were amazing.	Paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
Happy and sad.	Kusisqa llakisqa.
But that didn’t work out.	Ichaqa chaytaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
But you look beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi rikchakunki.
This was, and still is, really hard for me.	Kayqa karqa, kunankamapas, chiqap sasa ñuqapaq.
And happy, almost.	Hinaspa kusisqa, yaqa.
Not sure if this is a bug or a feature.	Mana segurochu kayqa huk pantasqa icha huk ruwana kasqanmanta.
He says!.	Payqa nin!.
I am doing that here.	Chaytaqa kaypim ruwachkani.
I can't find a way to do that.	Manam tarinichu imaynata chayta ruwanaypaq.
I don’t really want to think about it right now.	Manam kunanqa allintachu chaypi yuyaymanayta munani.
It’s not me, actually.	Manam ñuqachu kani, chiqaptaqa.
I mean, that’s not going to happen.	Niyta munani, chayqa manan kanqachu.
What is the best way to do that.	Imataq aswan allin ruway chayta ruwanapaq.
I am good for nothing.	Mana imapaqpas allinmi kani.
Many people are good.	Achka runakunaqa allinmi.
Instead, it’s probably the wrong thing to do.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá mana allinta ruwayqa.
He can’t do nothing.	Manan mana ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
Which was something else to do.	Imataq huk ruwana karqa.
Or a child.	Utaq wawa.
He would always be there for me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqapaq kanman karqa.
He would be fine in jail.	Payqa allinmi kanman carcelpi.
He was quick to talk about it.	Payqa usqhayllan chaymanta rimarqan.
It’s all mine.	Lliwmi ñuqapa.
It just sounds so good.	Chaylla ancha allinmi uyarikun.
Very quick and easy to avoid.	Ancha utqaylla hinaspa facilmi mana chayna kananpaq.
I think it’s better to go.	Yuyaykuni aswan allinmi riy.
It always has a different shape.	Sapa kutim huk rikchayniyuq.
Very happy here.	Ancha kusisqa kaypi.
The day had not yet gone well.	Chay punchawqa manaraqmi allintachu pasarqa.
It was difficult to speak.	Rimayqa sasam karqa.
He said there were really many.	Paymi nirqa chiqap achka kasqankuta.
If there is time.	Sichus kan tiempo chayqa.
However, this may not always be the case.	Ichaqa, kayqa manapaschá sapa kutichu kanman.
I can't find a way to fix this.	Kayta imayna allichayta mana tarinichu.
Okay, never mind.	Allinmi, mana hayk’aqpas.
I want it to be safe.	Mana imanasqa kananpaqmi munani.
He was in deep depression at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sinchitan hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
Do more with it.	Chaywan astawan ruway.
You act like you are not married.	Mana casarasqa hinam ruwanki.
I mean, it was hard not to.	Niyta munani, mana ruwayqa sasa karqa.
The greatest teacher in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan hatun yachachiq.
I wanted to hear everything.	Tukuy imata uyariyta munarqani.
He told me he was home.	Paymi niwarqa wasinpi kashasqanmanta.
There’s a way to do that, you know.	Chaypaqqa kanmi imayna ruwanapaq, yachanki.
I saw this coming.	Kay hamunanta rikurqani.
Don’t do this anymore.	Amaña kayta ruwaychu.
I just want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munani chaylla.
In fact, he doesn’t know much.	Aswanpas payqa manan anchatachu yachan.
I don’t feel right now.	Kunanqa mana allintachu sientekuni.
What if everyone had the.	Imataq kanman sichus llapa runa chay...
It’s an important task.	Importante ruwaymi.
The black stranger was not there.	Chay yana mana riqsisqa runaqa manam chaypichu kasqa.
Yes, but how? 	Arí, ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq?
Then another time.	Chaymanta huk pacha.
I don’t know what to say to anyone.	Manam yachanichu pimanpas ima niyta.
And you want him.	Hinaspa payta munanki.
The last hour.	Qhipa kaq hora.
They’re exhausted.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqañan kashanku.
I hear this all the time.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim uyarini.
The worst part was one thing.	Aswan mana allinqa huk kaqmi karqa.
Tell me one fact.	Huk chiqap kaqta willaway.
That’s what he said.	Chay nisqa.
I don’t want to see it again.	Manam hukmanta rikuyta munanichu.
They certainly are.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin kanku.
I don’t want to see it properly.	Manam allintachu qawayta munani.
It should be more serious, he thinks.	Aswan serio kanan, nispan yuyaykun.
He didn’t know she was here.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kaypi kashasqanmanta.
And then, .	Hinaspa chaymantaqa, .
This is a very bad thing.	Kayqa ancha mana allinchu.
I had no idea you could play like that.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani chayna pukllayta atisqaykita.
They’re not the fastest, but they’re fast.	Paykunaqa manan aswan usqhayllachu kanku, ichaqa usqhayllan kanku.
That was the saddest part.	Chayqa aswan llakikuypaqmi karqa.
That is why people are stupid.	Chayraykum runakunaqa mana yuyayniyuq kanku.
He was scared for some reason.	Imaraykupas mancharisqa kasqa.
Now that was great.	Kunanqa chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It didn’t make much sense.	Manam ancha yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
So yeah, he's right.	Chaymi arí, payqa chiqaptam rimachkan.
He is here but not here.	Payqa kaypi kachkan ichaqa manam kaypichu.
Wouldn’t that be nice.	Manachu chayqa sumaq kanqa.
He’s obviously doing well.	Sut’inmi allinta ruwashan.
I’m not the only one who knows this.	Manam ñuqallachu kayta yachani.
I’ll do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwasaq.
He was his name.	Payqa sutin karqan.
The next one should be.	Qatiqnin kanan.
And it was like that for a while.	Hinaspa huk rato chay hina karqan.
Not as difficult as it is now.	Mana kunan hinachu ancha sasa.
Forgive me for being foolish.	Pampachaykuway mana yuyayniyuq kasqayta.
He could not do that now.	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa ruwayta atirqachu.
That’s a tough thing to do.	Chayqa sinchi ruwaymi.
It’s fairly easy to do at home.	Wasipi ruwayqa allin facilmi.
But it’s not as great there.	Ichaqa manan chaypi hinachu hatun.
But this isn’t the first time.	Ichaqa kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu.
He said over and over again this happened.	Paymi nirqa yapamanta yapamanta kayqa pasasqanmanta.
But he was not such a man.	Ichaqa manan chay hina runachu karqan.
I know he wanted a better answer.	Yachanim aswan allin kutichiyta munasqanmanta.
Being so great.	Chayna hatun kay.
I didn’t know you could do that.	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
He was fired a year later.	Huk wata qhepamanmi qarqosqa karqan.
He didn’t want to sleep anymore.	Manaña puñuyta munarqanchu.
I don’t want this to happen tonight.	Manam munanichu kunan tuta kayna kananta.
I know you are not happy right now.	Yachanim kunan mana kusisqachu kasqaykita.
It should be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanan.
It will be easier for you.	Aswan facilmi kanqa qanpaq.
Seriously, no secret.	Serio, mana pakasqa.
That was going to be difficult.	Chayqa sasam kanan karqa.
He was like a celebrity here.	Payqa kaypi huk riqsisqa runa hinam karqa.
Now he was like a man.	Kunanqa huk runa hinam karqa.
So he does this.	Chaymi kayta ruwan.
Something is very, very wrong.	Imapas ancha, ancha mana allinchu kachkan.
He was fiercely reluctant to do anything.	Payqa sinchitan mana munarqanchu imatapas ruwayta.
I get that, okay.	Chaytaqa hap’ini, allinmi.
Sadly, that is what happened.	Llakikuypaqmi chayna pasarqa.
And actually, it was amazing.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I can't do that now.	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
I knew he would anyway.	Yacharqanim imayna kaptinpas chayna ruwananta.
I’m doing this now.	Kunanmi kayta ruwani.
That’s it, though.	Chayqa ichaqa.
But it doesn’t seem so simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu rikch’akun.
We didn’t do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwarqayku.
Learn how to work hard.	Yachay imaynatas sinchita llank’ayta.
Maybe not, after all.	Ichapas mana, tukuy imamanta.
I thought he could be great.	Yuyarqanim hatun kayta atinman nispa.
Here was the third.	Kaypiqa kimsa kaqmi karqa.
I was very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqani.
This is not a bad guy.	Kayqa manam millay runachu.
No one could find the right answer.	Manan pipas tariyta atirqanchu allin kutichiyta.
Maybe the best one.	Ichapas aswan allin kaq.
If you want to stay with me, you probably should.	Sichus ñoqawan qhepakuyta munanki chayqa, yaqapaschá chayta ruwanayki.
No, unfortunately not.	Manan, llakikuypaqmi mana.
Too much of it, somewhere.	Llumpay chaymanta, maypipas.
Unfortunately, that is the case.	Llakikuypaqmi chayna kasqanmanta.
It didn't matter what he said.	Manam imananpaschu karqa ima nisqanqa.
He wanted to see what she looked like.	Payqa imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam qawayta munarqa.
This is what I want.	Kaymi ñuqapa munani.
I don’t really worry about anything.	Manam imamantapas anchatachu llakikuni.
then again the.	chaymanta yapamanta chay.
It’s always so good.	Sapa kutim chayna allin.
I, nobody.	Ñuqa, mana pipas.
Things were much better then.	Chay tiempopiqa imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
He said that it was.	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
He refused to help her.	Payqa manan munarqanchu yanapayta.
It would be huge.	Hatun hatunmi kanman.
I was scared and worried.	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima karqani.
Everyone will be better off.	Lliwmi aswan allin kanqa.
Many people want to be famous.	Achka runakunam munanku riqsisqa kayta.
All so true.	Tukuy chayna chiqap.
Which was fine with him.	Imataq paywan allin karqa.
I don’t mean anything by that.	Manam chaywanqa imatapas niyta munanichu.
If you think about it, it’s obvious.	Chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa sut’inmi.
He can be serious though.	Payqa ichaqa serio kaytan atinman.
He will have to do it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwanan kanqa.
Very cold but very nice.	Ancha chiri ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I'm not sure what he would have done with it.	Manam segurochu kani imatam chaywan ruwanman karqa.
No, do it now.	Manan, kunan ruway.
Tonight was so silly.	Kunan tutaqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He could not hear them.	Chaykunataqa manam uyariyta atirqachu.
So it doesn't seem right.	Chaymi mana allintachu rikchakun.
You are the worse off.	Qamqa aswan mana allinmi kachkanki.
That he would be disappointed in her.	Paywan hukmanyasqa kananta.
I don't know .	Manam yachanichu .
This is what it means.	Kayta niyta munan.
That means being human.	Chayqa runa kay niyta munan.
Who knows, maybe it wasn’t.	Pi yachan, ichapas mana karqachu.
I want everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam munani.
He’d said it before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi nisqa.
That’s where he excels.	Chaypin payqa aswan allinqa.
He must be me.	Payqa ñuqam kanan.
Something almost as bad.	Imapas yaqa chayna mana allin.
There were some really good people here.	Kaypiqa wakin chiqap allin runakunam karqa.
A lot of people want a lot of money.	Achka runakunam achka qullqita munanku.
So you may not be able to do that.	Chaymi manapaschá chayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
The man is amazing.	Chay runaqa admirakuypaqmi.
You may not think of it as a skill.	Manapaschá chaytaqa huk yachay hinachu yuyaykunki.
I mean, he is.	Paymi niyta munani.
I wanted to be like him.	Pay hina kaytam munarqani.
It was a beautiful night.	Chay tutaqa sumaqmi karqa.
He still doesn’t know why he did it.	Kunankamapas manam yachanchu imanasqa chay ruwasqanta.
This was going to be very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi kanan karqa.
But it was a year later.	Ichaqa huk wata qhepamanmi karqan.
I want him badly.	Paytaqa mana allintam munani.
Maybe that thing is me.	Ichapas chay imapas ñuqa kani.
He can’t sit still.	Payqa manan tiyayta atinchu.
It certainly never was.	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
Now it was worse though.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinmi karqan ichaqa.
Two nights later.	Iskay tutamanta.
It’s not ambiguous.	Manam iskay yuyayniyuqchu.
There will never be such people.	Manan hayk’aqpas chay hina runakunaqa kanqachu.
I still knew it.	Kunankamapas yacharqanim.
To keep things safe.	Imapas mana imanasqa kananpaq.
You’re wrong.	Pantasqa kanki.
And then he took a good look.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa allinta qhawarisqa.
I really don't know how it happened.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imayna pasasqanmanta.
I don’t think about it anymore.	Manañam piensanichu.
Now he was finally ready.	Kunanqa qhepamanmi listoña kasharqan.
Yes, that’s all.	Arí, chayllam.
How it should be.	Imaynataq kanan.
Not together, anyway.	Mana kuskachu, imayna kaptinpas.
It was a late summer afternoon.	Chayqa karqan verano tarde tarde.
He won’t be good enough to talk about me.	Payqa manan allinchu kanqa ñoqamanta rimananpaq.
Yeah, this sounds crazy.	Arí, kayqa loco hinam uyarikun.
The result was a beautiful one.	Chay ruwasqanqa sumaqmi karqan.
Things were very difficult.	Imapas ancha sasam karqa.
But, the good thing.	Ichaqa, allin kaq.
Then he was.	Chaymantam payqa karqa.
He really can’t stop it.	Chiqamanta mana hark’ayta atinchu.
This approach is certainly not the best.	Kay ruwayqa chiqamanta mana aswan allinchu.
It’s too bad.	Llumpay mana allinmi.
Maybe next year will be better.	Ichapas hamuq wata aswan allin kanqa.
But he did not act alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu imatapas ruwarqan.
It seems so long ago.	Chayna unayñam rikchakun.
I doubt that.	Chaymantam iskayrayani.
He didn’t stay long.	Payqa manan unaytachu qhepakurqan.
But I didn’t see that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
But now, the problem.	Ichaqa kunan, sasachakuy.
You can’t tell anyone what to do.	Manan pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu ima ruwananta.
Say you are innocent.	Mana huchayoq kasqaykita niy.
A year later.	Huk wata qhepamanmi.
Like, really like him.	Imayna, chiqap pay hina.
He went through it badly.	Payqa mana allintam chaymanta pasarqa.
This must be absurd.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
But he didn't seem to have much to say.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu rimananpaq hina karqan.
I was very excited about this.	Kaymantaqa ancha kusisqam karqani.
He is just what he wants to be.	Payqa munasqanman hinallam kachkan.
He will do it one day.	Payqa huk punchawmi ruwanqa.
All the time now.	Tukuy pacha kunan.
He may be fired.	Ichapas qarqusqa kanman.
That's about a month.	Chayqa yaqa huk killa hinam.
You know, good for him.	Yachanki, paypaq allin.
If you think so, let me know.	Sichus chayta yuyaykunki chayqa, willaway.
It’s terribly uncomfortable out there.	Manchay mana allinchu hawapi.
You think quickly.	Usqhaylla yuyaykunki.
That’s going to be good for me.	Chayqa ñuqapaq allin kanqa.
Maybe this would have been a good thing.	Ichapas kayqa allin kanman karqa.
I mean really big.	Chiqamanta hatun niyta munani.
I know, people know.	Yachanim, runakunaqa yachanku.
Which is a good thing, a very good thing.	Imataq allin kaq, ancha allin kaq.
First and last time.	Ñawpaq kaq, qhipa kaq kuti.
You may not disagree.	Manapaschá mana acuerdopichu kanki.
So he was the one.	Chaymi payqa karqa.
He can’t walk like he used to.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu puriyta atin.
It’s a girl.	Huk sipasmi.
He wants to be the best person he can be.	Payqa munanmi aswan allin runa kayta.
No one knows where he is now.	Manam pipas yachanchu kunan maypi kasqanmantaqa.
And now he's very happy.	Hinaspa kunanqa ancha kusisqa kachkan.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan.
He was truly a lunatic.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin huk loco karqan.
He couldn't hold it from her.	Mana paymanta hapiyta atirqachu.
I never actually saw it.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa rikurqanichu.
But he is with me.	Paymi ichaqa ñoqawan kashan.
Of course, it wasn’t meant to be.	Arí, manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
Obviously, a challenge.	Sut’inmi, huk sasachakuy.
I am looking forward to working now.	Kunanqa anchatam suyachkani llamkayta.
But tonight it was.	Ichaqa kunan tutan karqan.
Maybe that’s me.	Ichapas chayqa ñuqa kani.
Not anymore, if they ever were.	Manañan, sichus hayk’aqllapas karqanku chayqa.
It’s not this.	Manan kaychu.
Actually that’s a good thing.	Chiqaptaqa chayqa allinmi.
He would always be with her.	Payqa sapa kutim paywan kanman.
That was wrong, he says.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqa, nispas nin.
I’m afraid he’s very angry.	Manchakuni ancha phiñasqa kasqanmanta.
It will probably be better.	Yaqapaschá aswan allin kanqa.
I don't know now.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu.
He wants everyone to do something like him.	Payqa munanmi llapa runa pay hina imatapas ruwananta.
It was too soon for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay utqayllam karqa.
It hardly seemed to exist at all.	Yaqapaschá ni imapipas kanman hinachu karqan.
No, it was surprisingly bad.	Manan, admirasqa mana allintachu karqan.
Now there was no reason.	Kunanqa manañan imaraykupas karqanchu.
They really are like this.	Chiqaptam kayna kachkanku.
That way it was better for him.	Chay hinaqa aswan allinmi karqan paypaq.
They were tired, cold and hungry.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqa, chiri, yarqasqa ima karqanku.
He didn’t know where or why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi nitaq imarayku.
No, it doesn’t exist yet.	Manan, manaraqmi kanchu.
He didn't know why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta.
But this would never happen, he knew.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kayqa kanqachu, chaytan yacharqan.
Everything is sad and miserable.	Tukuy imapas llakikuypaqmi, llakikuypaqmi.
I can’t sit still for long.	Manam unaytachu tiyayta atiyman.
I’m a teenager.	Ñuqaqa wayna sipasmi kani.
You never think about it.	Manam haykapipas piensankichu.
This is seriously so easy.	Kayqa serio ancha facilmi.
Not today not.	Mana kunan punchawchu mana.
But there is a reason.	Ichaqa kanmi imarayku.
Actually, that's what you mean.	Chiqaptaqa chaytam niyta munanki.
This means great information.	Kayqa hatun willayta niyta munan.
I can’t stand the food.	Mikhunata mana aguantayta atinichu.
Less than nothing, actually.	Aswan pisi mana imamanta, chiqaptaqa.
But this is not a disagreement.	Ichaqa manan kayqa mana acuerdopichu kashan.
But it’s always wrong.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi mana allinchu.
But he wants to know the truth.	Ichaqa cheqaqta yachayta munan.
Not quite right.	Mana allintachu.
He certainly had it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta hap’irqan.
It could be three weeks.	Kimsa semanan kanman.
And last night.	Hinaspa qayna tuta.
That doesn’t exist now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa kanchu.
He doesn’t want to see her.	Mana payta rikuyta munanchu.
That was almost always the case.	Yaqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
Then something went wrong.	Chaymanta imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I am alone here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi sapallay kachkani.
He was as big as you, but crazy.	Payqa qan hina hatunmi karqan, ichaqa loco.
He might be able to do that.	Payqa ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman.
House this week.	Wasi kay semanapi.
So be reasonable.	Chaymi allin yuyayniyuq kay.
But remember, we can't get out of here.	Ichaqa ama qunqaychu, manam kaymanta lluqsiyta atichwanchu.
One of them is for me.	Hukninmi ñuqapaq.
The reason for this is simple.	Chayna kasqanmanta imaraykupas manam sasachu.
Probably someone knows.	Yaqapaschá pipas yachan.
I want to do it all right.	Tukuy chayta allinta ruwayta munani.
Often this can be a problem.	Sapa kutim chayqa sasachakuy kanman.
He prefers to be alone.	Payqa aswan allinmi sapallan kayta.
Everyone was hungry, scared and confused.	Lliwmi yarqasqa, mancharisqa, pantasqa ima karqaku.
Now he wants to get out.	Kunanqa lluqsiyta munan.
Here it is here.	Kaypi kaypi kachkan.
He didn't spend long.	Payqa manam unaytachu pasarqa.
And that’s not a good thing.	Hinaspa chayqa mana allinchu.
No one really has any idea.	Chiqaptaqa manam pipas ima yuyayniyuqchu.
A black child.	Huk yana wawa.
He knows where they are.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kasqankuta.
And he told me.	Hinan niwarqan.
And who it was.	Hinaspa pichus karqan.
One of them is missing.	Hukninmi mana kanchu.
But one might make a better song.	Ichaqa hukninmi aswan allin takiyta ruwanman.
It really needs that.	Chiqamanta chayta necesitan.
He always makes a good play.	Payqa sapa kutim allin pukllayta ruwan.
Bad, bad, bad day.	Mana allin, mana allin, mana allin punchaw.
He knew there was nothing for him.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana imapas paypaq kasqanmanta.
But that is not the case today.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kunan tiempopiqa.
That's the next best thing.	Chayqa qatiqnin aswan allin kaqmi.
What does it say in it.	Imatataq chaypi nin.
They were fairly disappointed.	Paykunaqa allintam hukmanyasqa karqaku.
He cannot be like that.	Payqa manan chay hina kayta atinmanchu.
He could not do this.	Payqa manam kayta ruwayta atirqachu.
That was the first one.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
You have a lot of ideas.	Achka yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
He couldn't do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atirqachu.
He was a very wicked man.	Payqa ancha millay runam karqa.
But it was a good thing.	Ichaqa huk allin ruwaymi karqan.
I doubt he ever thought he would.	Iskayrayani haykapipas chayta ruwananpaq yuyaykusqanmanta.
I’m not quite sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa allintachu seguro kani.
I couldn’t form a sentence.	Manam huk rimayta ruwayta atirqanichu.
Nothing more than one.	Mana imapas aswan huk.
I don’t know what’s going to happen here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi ima pasananta.
But he thought it would help.	Ichaqa piensaranmi chaywan yanapananta.
He seemed unfazed.	Payqa mana mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
You know that as well as anyone.	Chaytaqa pi runa hinam yachanki.
He's not stupid.	Mana sonso pay.
You are a smart, smart girl.	Qamqa yachaysapa, yachaysapa sipasmi kanki.
I thought better of it.	Aswan allinta yuyaykurqani chaymanta.
Very good said.	Ancha allin nisqa.
But everything just happened.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
But, people aren’t sure where it is.	Ichaqa, runakunaqa manan segurochu kanku maypi kasqanmanta.
But I knew it all along.	Ichaqa tukuy tiempon chaytaqa yacharqani.
I feel bad without it.	Mana chaywanqa mana allintachu sientekuni.
Probably not enough.	Yaqapaschá mana chayllachu.
They are all very tired.	Llapallankum ancha sayk’usqa kachkanku.
Yes, I am, I am.	Arí, ñuqam kani, nispa.
I was so proud of myself.	Anchatam orgulloso karqani ñuqamanta.
Everything for no reason.	Tukuy imapas mana imaraykupas.
Some things, sure.	Wakin imakuna, seguro.
Not sure what happened here.	Mana segurochu kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He can’t tell.	Payqa manan willayta atinchu.
However, he was.	Ichaqa, payqa karqan.
Not really that often.	Mana chiqaptaqa chayna sapa kutichu.
But the best part is easy.	Ichaqa aswan allinqa facilmi.
I actually never expected this.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas kayta suyarqanichu.
In his failure to do so.	Mana ruwasqanpi.
They want it to be that way.	Chayna kasqanta munanku.
But yes, it is.	Ichaqa arí.
It was going to be amazing.	Admirakuypaqmi kanan karqa.
I've done it twice now.	Kunanqa iskay kutitam ruwarqani.
Not really my thing to be honest.	Mana chiqaptachu ñuqapa imapas chiqap rimanaypaq.
He meant to say.	Payqa niyta munarqa.
Here’s a little bit about it.	Kaypi huk chikan chaymanta.
I am not as smart as you are.	Manam qam hinachu yachaysapa kani.
But of course it was very real.	Ichaqa sut’inmi ancha cheqaq karqan.
He had to do it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwanan karqan.
Someone should make a movie about him one day.	Pipas huk punchawmi paymanta peliculata ruwanan.
Everything looks the same as before.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaq hinam rikchakun.
The hidden one, the other hidden, the other self.	Pakasqa huknin, huknin pakasqa, huknin kikin.
He probably said something.	Payqa yaqapaschá imatapas nisqa.
He was here now.	Payqa kunan kaypi kasqa.
So the more, the merrier.	Chaymi aswan achka kaptinqa, aswan kusisqa.
He was a terribly secretive man, you know.	Payqa manchay pakasqa runan karqan, yachanki.
Even so, it is important.	Chayna kaptinpas ancha allinmi.
I have no idea how he knows how to do that.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynatam chayta ruwayta yachan.
Okay, he was crazy.	Allinmi, payqa loco kasqa.
I hope you can do the same.	Suyachkani qampas chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
But it still means something, though .	Ichaqa hinallam imapas niyta munan, ichaqa .
Then I felt funny.	Chaymantaqa asikunapaq hinam tarikurqani.
One like me.	Huk ñuqa hina.
I wasn’t surprised, really.	Manam admirakurqanichu, chiqaptapuni.
Surely this couldn’t be harder.	Chiqamanta kayqa mana aswan sasachu kanman.
This, however, is not a good thing.	Kaymi ichaqa mana allinchu.
Two days, three days.	Iskay punchaw, kimsa punchaw.
But he couldn’t get there.	Ichaqa manan chayayta atirqanchu.
That was it, that was it.	Chayqa karqan, chaymi karqan.
This isn’t good though.	Kayqa manan allinchu ichaqa.
More than one step needs to be taken.	Aswan huk ruwaykunata ruwana tiyan.
As in the time of the.	Chay tiempopi hina.
Black head.	Yana uma.
And then things went wrong.	Hinaspa chaymanta imapas mana allinchu karqa.
Two years ago now.	Iskay wata ñawpaqta kunan.
Now he was gone.	Kunanqa manañam karqachu.
It’s actually cold.	Chiqaptaqa chiri kachkan.
It’s not something that’s easy.	Manam imapas chayllachu.
He knew the language.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay simita.
That was not the case.	Chay nisqanqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Hope you do it sooner.	Munaymanmi aswan utqaylla ruwasqaykita.
I would make it happen.	Chayna kananpaqmi ruwayman karqa.
I would be a bad guy.	Mana allin runam kayman.
Maybe he eats too much, maybe he doesn’t.	Ichapas llumpayta mikun, manapaschá.
Time for him to learn.	Pay yachananpaq tiempo.
But I don’t see anyone.	Ichaqa manan pitapas rikunichu.
Now I’m on to something else.	Kunanqa huk imapipas kachkani.
And several times since then.	Hinaspa chaymanta pacha achka kutita.
I think everyone wants a good job.	Yuyaykuni llapa runa allin llamkayta munanku.
I couldn’t understand why.	Manam entiendeyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
This is rather unfortunate.	Kayqa aswan llakikuypaqmi.
You can’t believe how awesome it is.	Mana creeyta atiwaqchu imayna manchay kasqanta.
This was the last time it would be like that.	Kaymi karqan qhepa kutipi chhayna kanan.
Like the night before.	Ñawpaq tuta hina.
Is there anything else.	¿Imapas kanchu.
I was never able to work it out.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa allichayta atirqanichu.
A different world, a very different world.	Chikan pacha, ancha chikan pacha.
If you do this.	Kayta ruwanki chayqa.
That is difficult now.	Chayqa kunanqa sasam.
But now everything is fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
You know that he will.	Yachankim chayna ruwananta.
But they know it.	Ichaqa yachanku.
That will be a good thing.	Chaywanqa allinmi kanqa.
He was clearly disappointed.	Sut’inmi hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
This guy wasn’t there.	Kay runaqa manam karqachu.
I almost saw it.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa rikurqani.
But, unfortunately, this will never happen.	Ichaqa, llakikuypaqmi, kayqa manam haykapipas kanqachu.
Everything is easier.	Tukuy imapas aswan facilmi.
Really nice.	Chiqap sumaq.
And therein lies the problem.	Hinaspa chaypim kachkan chay sasachakuy.
The riches would have been everyone.	Qhapaq kaykunaqa llapa runan kanman karqan.
I think you’re sad and frustrated.	Yuyaykuni llakisqa, hukmanyasqa ima kasqaykita.
He was there for a reason.	Payqa imaraykupas chaypim karqa.
And at the time, that was a pretty big deal.	Hinaspa chay tiempopiqa chayqa ancha hatunmi karqan.
He said it was only once.	Huk kutilla kasqanmantam nirqa.
This was a really tough year.	Kayqa chiqap sasa wata karqa.
I have seen too many.	Llumpay achkatam rikurqani.
I really didn't expect that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa suyarqanichu.
It is a process, but not an easy one.	Chayqa huk ruwaymi, ichaqa manan facilchu.
It was another cold winter day.	Huk chiri chiri punchawmi karqa.
I doubt anyone has.	Iskayrayani pipas chayna kasqanmanta.
I hadn’t heard of it.	Manam chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu.
But I can't work.	Ichaqa manan llank'ayta atinichu.
But by now everyone knows that.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa llapallankum chaytaqa yachanku.
This is a nice guy.	Kay sumaq runa.
But, he couldn’t have done that.	Ichaqa, manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
It was beautiful there.	Chaypiqa sumaqmi karqa.
You can’t stand him.	Paytaqa manam aguantayta atiwaqchu.
I don’t see how that’s going to happen.	Manam rikunichu imayna chay pasananta.
But he has no intention of leaving.	Ichaqa manan ripuyta yuyaykunchu.
They were inhuman.	Paykunaqa mana runa hinam karqaku.
Learn to be happy every day.	Sapa punchaw kusisqa kayta yachay.
He said all of that.	Tukuy chaytam nirqa.
That makes more sense.	Chayqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi.
That is, to do it right.	Chayqa, allinta ruwanapaq.
So you will be disappointed all the time.	Chaymi tukuy tiempo hukmanyasqa kanki.
But there it is! 	Ichaqa chaypi!
It was okay to be uncomfortable.	Allinmi karqa mana allin kayqa.
And again two months.	Hinaspa yapamanta iskay killa.
You’re fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kanki.
I’ll be there today.	Kunanmi chaypi kasaq.
It wouldn’t have been very good for him.	Manan ancha allinchu kanman karqan paypaq.
Maybe he should.	Ichapas payqa ruwanan.
I never though.	Manam haykapipas ichaqa.
The minimum is weekly.	Aswan pisi kaqmi sapa semana.
It’s not a great way to do it later.	Manan ancha allinchu qhepaman ruwayqa.
They seemed worried.	Paykunaqa llakisqa hinam karqaku.
Something to do this weekend.	Imapas kay semana tukukuypi ruwanapaq.
They are horrible, evil people.	Paykunaqa manchay, millay runakunam.
But I don’t have time, really.	Ichaqa manan tiempoy kanchu, cheqaqtapuni.
He left feeling very sorry for her.	Paymanta sinchi llakisqa ripurqan.
This should be good for you.	Kayqa qampaq allin kanan tiyan.
I have no idea how that happened.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna chay kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe it never was.	Ichapas mana haykapipas karqachu.
It seemed easier.	Aswan facilmi rikchakurqa.
I can't do the work.	Manam llamkayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
Perhaps they were happy.	Ichapas kusisqa karqaku.
Nowhere ever.	Mana maypipas hayk’aqpas.
I didn’t know where to go.	Manam yacharqanichu maymanpas rinaypaq.
He said he just felt better.	Nisqa chaylla allinta sientekusqanmanta.
But it’s now.	Ichaqa kunanmi.
I want to see him tomorrow.	Paqarin payta rikuyta munani.
Like, ridiculous.	Imayna, asikunapaq hina.
Go there!.	¡Chayman riy!.
And he just told me.	Hinaspa chayllaraq niwarqa.
He had to be tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa kanan karqan.
Great knowledge.	Hatun yachay.
You’ll probably do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanki.
I mean, all the time.	Niyta munani, sapa kutilla.
But this is never always the case.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas sapa kutichu chay hinaqa.
Not really, that’s what he did.	Manan cheqaqtachu, chaytan ruwarqan.
Maybe not.	Ichapas mana.
I don’t always do it right.	Manam sapa kutichu allinta ruwani.
So don’t forget.	Chaymi ama qunqaychu.
I talked to him every day.	Sapa punchawmi paywan rimaq kani.
I don’t have a great idea.	Manam hatun yuyayniyuqchu kani.
He thought hard.	Payqa sinchitan yuyaykurqan.
I wish you weren’t.	Mana chayna kasqaykita munayman.
It almost seems like he wants her here.	Yaqapaschá kaypi payta munanman hina.
It’s a strong thing.	Sinchi kaqmi.
But tonight he was alone.	Ichaqa kunan tutan sapallan kasharqan.
He knew he was a villain.	Payqa yacharqanmi millay runa kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to be like that.	Manam chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I still ignored them.	Hinallam chaykunataqa mana uyarirqanichu.
He pleaded guilty.	Paymi huchayoq kasqanmanta nirqa.
You can’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yachayta atiwaqchu.
It was really good.	Chiqap allinmi karqa.
I felt almost human.	Yaqa runa hinam tarikurqani.
The last step is the last step.	Qhipa ruwayqa qhipa ruwaymi.
You do what you have to do.	Imachus ruwanayki kaqta ruwanki.
He had to do it to someone.	Pimanpas ruwanan karqan.
And it worked out very well.	Hinaspa ancha allintam lluqsirqa.
In the new city.	Musuq llaqtapi.
He did it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqan.
No one has done that yet.	Manaraqmi pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I am not very good at this.	Kaypiqa manam ancha allinchu kani.
You want to do this.	Kayta ruwayta munanki.
That was the old days.	Chayqa ñawpaq tiempon karqan.
I know what a good person you are.	Yachanim ima allin runa kasqaykita.
Obviously he was.	Sut’inmi payqa karqan.
Do what you have to do.	Imatachus ruwana kaqta ruway.
Every girl can.	Sapa sipasmi atin.
But it had to be you.	Ichaqa qanmi kanan karqan.
Only I can solve the problem.	Ñuqallam chay sasachakuy allichayta atiyman.
That’s the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi.
For quick action.	Usqhaylla ruwanapaq.
I actually don’t know how to sing.	Chiqaptaqa manam takiyta yachanichu.
And, well, that’s it.	Hinaspa, allinmi, chaymi.
He is not there yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chaypichu kachkan.
He just told me.	Chayraqmi niwarqa.
But he refused, not like this.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu, manan kay hinachu.
Maybe he wanted it to be that way.	Ichapas chayna kananta munarqa.
That would be the case in most cases.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna kanman.
That’s the wrong thing, as always.	Chayqa pantasqa kaqmi, sapa kuti hina.
But that was yesterday.	Ichaqa chayqa qayna p’unchaymi karqan.
I thought that was kind of funny.	Chayqa huk laya asikunapaq hina kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He would not have been happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kanman karqan.
I didn’t want him there with me.	Manam munarqanichu chaypi ñuqawan kananta.
He’s never done a movie before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas huk peliculata ruwarqanchu.
It can't work.	Mana llamk'ayta atinchu.
This doesn't sound like you.	Kayqa manam qam hinachu uyarikun.
We had a game that night.	Chay tutan huk pukllayta ruwarqayku.
And you know, it actually looks really nice.	Hinaspa yachanki, chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
He wants to be great.	Payqa hatun kaytam munan.
I know that's stupid.	Yachanim chayqa sonso kasqanmanta.
Maybe you want to build a new home.	Ichapas musuq wasi ruwayta munanki.
Like a school or something.	Yachay wasi hina utaq imapas.
If he was right.	Sichus payqa allinta rimarqan chayqa.
It doesn’t mean that.	Mana niyta munan.
It was increasingly clear that this was not the case.	Aswan sut’inmi karqan mana chhayna kasqanmanta.
I don't see this.	Kaytaqa manam rikunichu.
That’s where you plan that last step.	Chaypin chay qhepa kaq ruwayta yuyaykunki.
I did very well too.	Ñuqapas ancha allintam ruwarqani.
It’s surprisingly better.	Admirakuypaqmi aswan allinqa.
I could not have been any better.	Manam aswan allinchu kaytaqa atiymanchu karqa.
Anything better .	Imapas aswan allinmi .
You will never be unhappy.	Manam haykapipas mana kusisqachu kanki.
I am really proud of him.	Chiqaptam paymanta orgulloso kani.
I know exactly where it is.	Maypi kasqanmanta allinta yachani.
It could have been faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanman karqa.
He said it was fine, maybe he would.	Allinmi nispas nisqa, ichapas chayta ruwanman.
That wasn’t a problem.	Chayqa manam sasachu karqa.
It’s great you’re there.	Ancha allinmi chaypi kanki.
A difficult man, but a good man.	Sasa runa, ichaqa allin runa.
But a handsome young man.	Ichaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq wayna.
Do it now!.	¡Kunan ruway!.
He is safe here.	Payqa kaypim seguro kachkan.
I think this is the right thing to do.	Kayqa allin ruwaymi, nispan yuyaykuni.
I know you don't want to remember.	Yachanim mana yuyariyta munasqaykita.
This would be very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
I wasn't quite alone either.	Ñuqapas manam allintachu sapallay karqani.
Busy all morning.	Tukuy paqarin ocupasqa.
I’m not sure if this is correct.	Manam allintachu yachani kayqa allinchu icha manachu.
One day he went out.	Huk punchawmi payqa lluqsirqa.
Here, right now.	Kaypi, kunanpacha.
In fact, he did so after the third.	Aswanpas kinsa kaq qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
There’s no reason, really.	Manam imaraykupas kanchu, chiqaptapuni.
Find out what he wants.	Ima munasqanmanta yachay.
That wouldn’t be like me.	Chayqa manan ñoqa hinachu kanman.
But eventually he agreed.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi payqa arí nisqa.
But this is sort of .	Ichaqa kayqa huk laya .
He was not unhappy with me.	Payqa manam ñuqawanqa mana kusisqachu karqa.
He knew so much.	Payqa ancha achkatam yacharqa.
However, this does not always work.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay ruwayqa allinpaq.
But it doesn’t seem to do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwaq hinachu.
Who wants to be with me?.	¿Pitaq ñuqawan kuska kayta munan?.
That was the morning man, this was him.	Chayqa karqan paqarin runa, kaymi pay karqan.
I have always thought so.	Ñoqaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna piensarqani.
All that nasty time.	Tukuy chay millay pacha.
It shouldn’t be like that anymore.	Manañan chay hinachu kanan.
He doesn’t want to walk or do anything.	Mana puriyta munanchu nitaq ima ruwaytapas munanchu.
People are very.	Runakunaqa ancha.
Not that bad really.	Mana chayna mana allinchu chiqaptaqa.
But no one could sit down.	Ichaqa manan pipas tiyayta atirqanchu.
Blacks are consistently the least likely to be married.	Yana runakunaqa sapa kutim aswan pisi casarasqa kanku.
But the other one, yes.	Ichaqa hukninmi, arí.
Maybe he’s better though.	Ichapas payqa aswan allin kanman ichaqa.
I want to talk to someone.	Piwanpas rimayta munani.
Sorry, that was me.	Pampachaykuway, chaymi ñuqa karqani.
He would have loved to come here.	Payqa anchatan munanman karqan kayman hamuyta.
Both are in good practice.	Iskayninku allin ruwaypi kanku.
He has to do what he can.	Payqa atisqanman hinan ruwanan.
I don't understand how that happened.	Manam entiendenichu imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
I know what’s coming too.	Ñuqapas yachanim ima hamunanta.
All the time, as a matter of fact.	Tukuy pacha, chiqap hina.
I barely knew the word.	Chay simitaqa yaqapaschá yacharqani.
He was such a handsome man.	Payqa chayna sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa.
Baby, this is great.	Wawa, kayqa ancha allinmi.
But it was a bad thing to do.	Ichaqa mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
He said it twice.	Iskay kutitam chayta nirqa.
One night I went home with him.	Huk tutam paywan kuska wasiyman rirqani.
I don’t want to know this.	Kaytaqa manam yachayta munanichu.
He is not up to it yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chayman hinachu kachkan.
No one would ever do it, either.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas ruwanmanchu, nitaq.
Not at all, again.	Mana imapipas, yapamanta.
He couldn't say much.	Achkatam mana niyta atirqachu.
They don’t really want to do that.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayta ruwayta munanku.
He doesn't know what to do.	Manam yachanchu ima ruwananta.
But never him.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas paytaqa.
He says he has no idea.	Payqa mana ima yuyayniyuq kasqayta nin.
But if you do that.	Ichaqa sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa.
I was mostly alone.	Yaqa llapanpim sapallay karqani.
I know what day this is.	Yachanim ima punchawmi kay kasqanmanta.
So that would be very difficult.	Chaymi chayqa ancha sasa kanman.
He has so much for me.	Payqa ancha achkatam ñuqapaq kachkan.
And you do it again.	Hinaspa yapamanta ruwanki.
I get it, you're busy.	Chayta hapini, qamqa ocupasqa kachkanki.
I do, however, have an opinion.	Ñuqaqa ichaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He knew he was right, this time.	Payqa yacharqanmi allin kashasqanmanta, kay kutipi.
Without doing anything with it.	Mana chaywan imatapas ruwaspaqa.
Nothing was right there.	Chaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
It was the way he wanted to do it.	Chayqa karqan imayna ruway munasqanman hinan.
He never knew that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
No, it was actually in the house.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chay wasipi karqan.
It’s bigger than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan hatunmi.
You are the nicest person.	Qamqa aswan sumaq runam kanki.
Older than him, more.	Paymanta kuraq, astawan.
If you want to make money, that’s pretty easy.	Qullqita tariyta munanki chayqa, chayqa ancha facilmi.
After that, he wanted to do it all the time.	Chay qhepamanmi tukuy tiempo ruwayta munarqan.
And that’s the process.	Hinaspa chay ruway.
Who is a maker.	Pitaq huk ruwaq.
This is rather surprising.	Kayqa aswan admirakuypaqmi.
He was never able to find a suitable home.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas allin wasi tariyta atirqanchu.
But he cannot fix it many times.	Ichaqa manan askha kutita allichayta atinmanchu.
I am like a human being.	Huk runa hinam kani.
But that must be done first.	Ichaqa chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwana.
It was never just enough.	Manan hayk’aqpas chayllachu karqan.
It just, well, happened.	Chaylla, allinmi, pasarqa.
You are pretty safe here.	Kaypiqa allintam seguro kachkanki.
This was foolishness.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi karqa.
He can’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwayta atinman.
No, he can't	Manan, manan atinchu .
There is hardly anything there.	Chaypiqa yaqapaschá imapas kanchu.
He did it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas ruwarqa.
I never really had to.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaytaqa ruwanay karqachu.
I had a bad attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
The first one wanted the easy way out.	Ñawpaq kaqmi munarqa chay facil lluqsiyta.
He was sad and depressed.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkarqa.
I want to do something.	Imatapas ruwayta munani.
I can always be with you.	Sapa kutim qanwan kayta atiyman.
But it has always been so.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna.
I was quite surprised at what happened.	Allintam admirakurqani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I always wanted to win.	Sapa kutim atipayta munarqani.
But never again.	Ichaqa ama hayk'aqpas.
He knows the feeling all too well.	Payqa allintan yachan chay sientekusqanmanta.
Real black with that.	Chiqap yana chaywan.
But he had no idea where.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi chayta.
How could that be.	Imaynataq chay kanman.
Something happened with it.	Chaywanmi imapas pasarqa.
The action is good.	Ruwayqa allinmi.
It’s all right there.	Allinmi chaypi.
But, .	Ichaqa, .
Then half that.	Chaymanta kuskan chayta.
Goodness is better than greatness.	Allin kayqa aswan allinmi hatun kaymantaqa.
He told her to be there.	Chaypi kananpaq nirqa.
If they’re worried, you’re worried.	Sichus llakisqa kashanku chayqa, qanmi llakisqa kashanki.
That he probably doesn’t know I exist.	Chayqa manapaschá yachanchu kasqaymanta.
The world.	Kay pacha.
It was crazy to do this.	Kayta ruwayqa loco hinam karqa.
But he refused to tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta munarqanchu.
You may not know how, why, or what.	Manapaschá yachankichu imaynata, imanasqa, imamantapas.
Please don't ever do that.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwaychu.
I don’t remember what.	Manam yuyarinichu imata.
Now is the time, the easy time to do that.	Kunanmi tiempo, chayta ruwanapaq facil tiempo.
In fact, they are both.	Aswanpas iskayninkun kanku.
It would have been very bad.	Ancha mana allinchu kanman karqan.
That’s why he’s so scared.	Chayraykum payqa ancha mancharisqa kachkan.
He's really doing this.	Payqa chiqaptam kayta ruwachkan.
We can’t go there.	Chaymanqa manam riyta atichwanchu.
He couldn’t stand it.	Manas aguantayta atirqachu.
Very sorry for him.	Ancha llakisqa paymanta.
I know you know you can.	Yachanim atisqaykita yachasqaykita.
Yes, it is very difficult.	Arí, sinchi sasam.
So he said the strange thing.	Chayraykum chay mana riqsisqa rimayta nirqa.
I am not having a happy day.	Manam kusisqa punchawchu kachkani.
Sure will do.	Seguro ruwanqa.
Nothing wrong with that.	Mana imapas mana allinchu chaypiqa.
For some reason you did it.	Imaraykupas qanmi ruwarqanki.
Then, no more.	Chaymanta, manaña.
I don’t know what would cause it.	Mana yachanichu imachus chayta ruwanman chayta.
You are very intelligent.	Ancha yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
It's all about what it is.	Chayqa tukuy ima kasqanmantam.
There, now it’s better.	Chaypi, kunanqa aswan allinmi.
You, you can’t.	Qamqa, mana atiwaqchu.
It will be good for sure.	Allinmi kanqa seguro.
This should be a nightly thing.	Kayqa sapa tuta imapas kanan.
He is the most difficult person in the world.	Paymi kay pachapi aswan sasa runa.
What you can do.	Ima atisqaykita.
He immediately agreed with me.	Payqa chayllam ñuqawan acuerdopi karqa.
One, two, three	Huk, iskay, kimsa .
I’d rather not know for sure.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana seguro yachayta.
It wasn’t good twice.	Mana allinchu karqan iskay kutita.
Yes, it’s a beautiful night.	Arí, sumaq tutam.
A famous person said so.	Huk riqsisqa runam chaynata nirqa.
Were they ready?.	¿Listochu karqanku?.
I felt pretty safe.	Allin segurom tarikurqani.
I couldn’t fix it.	Manam allichayta atirqanichu.
Which is kind of easy.	Imataq huk laya facil.
Just don’t do it here.	Chaylla ama kaypi ruwaychu.
I will do so much for you.	Anchatam qampaq ruwasaq.
He was so tired of pretending.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqañan kasharqan hina ruwaspa.
There was something very real about it.	Chaypin ancha cheqaq kaq karqan.
I didn’t know how to do it or what to say.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta nitaq ima niyta.
Instead, one of them does.	Aswanpas hukninmi chayta ruwan.
Better now.	Aswan allinta kunan.
He recently visited the city.	Payqa chayllaraqmi chay llaqtaman rirqa.
He's going to be fine.	Payqa allintam rinqa.
I don’t know how to respond.	Manam yachanichu imayna kutichiyta.
I don’t want to know about it.	Manam chaymanta yachayta munanichu.
It was horribly cold.	Millay chiri karqa.
And if that’s the case.	Hinaspa chayna kaptinqa.
I think it does a great job in the community.	Yuyaykuni hatun llamkayta ruwan llaqtapi.
I'm not sure if that's what you really mean.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chayta chiqaptapuni niyta munanki.
He never really wanted that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa cheqaqtachu munarqan.
I’m really tired.	Chiqamanta sayk’usqa kachkani.
He had to do that.	Payqa chaynatam ruwanan karqa.
If there is no reason.	Mana imaraykupas kaptinqa.
We talked, maybe not often, but we talked.	Rimaq kayku, ichapas mana sapa kutichu, ichaqa rimaq kayku.
And the first year.	Hinaspa ñawpaq wata.
This is where he excelled.	Kaypim payqa allinta ruwarqa.
He knew he could do better.	Payqa yacharqanmi aswan allinta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
This tenth house.	Kay chunka wasi.
That was twice as good.	Chayqa iskay kuti aswan allinmi karqan.
That wasn’t always a good thing now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa sapa kutichu allin karqan.
This man needs a party like no one else.	Kay runaqa manan pipas hinachu fiestata necesitan.
An unknown person.	Mana riqsisqa runa.
There was almost always someone talking.	Yaqa sapa kutim pipas chaypi rimaq karqa.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan atinmanchu.
So now you want to know more.	Chaymi kunanqa astawan yachayta munanki.
But he couldn’t, not quite.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu, manan allintachu.
That’s stupid, man.	Chayqa sonso, runa.
They were obviously very tired.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi ancha sayk’usqa karqanku.
That was probably the best part.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allinqa karqan.
You know how to play the game.	Pukllayta yachanki.
It makes a good story, that’s all.	Allin willakuyta ruwan, chaylla.
He didn’t want to tell her.	Payqa manan willayta munarqanchu.
I barely saw it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas yaqapaschá rikurqani.
That may be true.	Chayqa ichapas chiqap kanman.
Black is good for you.	Yana qampaq allin.
Maybe it was something, maybe not.	Ichapas imapas karqa, manapaschá.
Terribly, terribly sick.	Manchay, manchay unqusqa.
Tell me why you want to leave.	Willaway imanasqa ripuyta munanki.
Repeat, same process.	Yapamanta ruway, kikin ruway.
It was really time.	Chiqaptam tiempo karqa.
And then it will happen.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa chayna kanqa.
He obviously didn’t want to.	Payqa sut’inmi mana munarqanchu.
I did this two months ago.	Kaytaqa iskay killa ñawpaqta ruwarqani.
Not only that, it’s the most beautiful thing.	Mana chayllachu, aswan sumaq kaqmi.
If so, you will continue.	Chayna kaptinqa hinallam kanki.
She wants to buy things for him.	Payqa munanmi imakunatapas paypaq rantiyta.
Here the evil is greater.	Kaypiqa mana allinqa aswan hatunmi.
So we are really excited about that.	Chaymi chaymantaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkaniku.
But that was tomorrow.	Ichaqa chayqa paqarinmi karqan.
But you are a better person than I am.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki ñoqamanta aswan allin runa.
Two, if you will.	Iskay, munaspaqa.
I can do that pretty well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwayta atiyman.
You know what people are like.	Yachankim runakuna imayna kasqankuta.
But it wasn’t like it is today.	Ichaqa manan kunan tiempo hinaqa karqanchu.
Some other night of this.	Wakin huk tuta kaymanta.
And he had an idea, a better one.	Hinaspa huk yuyayniyuq karqan, aswan allin yuyayniyuq.
And that was it, really.	Hinaspa chaymi karqan, cheqaqtapuni.
Maybe not a great guy.	Ichapas mana hatun runachu.
No one wants to see it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa qawayta munanchu.
It wasn’t really me.	Manam chiqaptaqa ñuqachu karqani.
Then again, maybe it should.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas chayna kanan.
Okay, no, it won't.	Allinmi, manam, manam ruwanqachu.
I do things all the time.	Sapa kutim imakunatapas ruwani.
Instead, it can be harmful.	Aswanpas mana allintan ruwanman.
He knew he wasn't supposed to be here.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana kaypi kananta.
But there is something good about it.	Ichaqa chaypiqa imapas allinmi kachkan.
In most cases, they are.	Yaqa llapanpim chayna kanku.
Maybe you’ll know right away.	Ichapas chaylla yachanki.
I love to learn things.	Imakunatapas yachayta anchata munani.
Maybe this will be the time.	Ichapas kay tiempo kanqa.
Never, never never.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas mana hayk’aqpas.
That has been going on for too long.	Chayqa llumpay unayñam kachkan.
You know how to do that.	Chayta ruwayta yachanki.
He really couldn't see why.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana rikuyta atirqanchu imarayku chayta ruwananpaq.
I didn’t expect to learn anything new about myself.	Manam suyarqanichu ñuqamanta imapas musuq yachayta.
But it probably will be.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kanqa.
Yes, he wants to do the right thing.	Arí, payqa allintam ruwayta munan.
He can't learn.	Payqa manam yachayta atinchu.
This man, or one like him.	Kay runa, utaq pay hina huk.
They seem pretty happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska allin kusisqa hinam kanku.
He knew it wasn't enough.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayllachu kasqanmanta.
It’s been two years now.	Kunanqa iskay watañam.
I mean, okay .	Niyta munani, allinmi .
Tomorrow should be a good day.	Paqarin punchawmi allin punchaw kanan.
He wasn’t a bad guy.	Payqa manan mana allinchu karqan.
I can’t sing it.	Manam takiyta atiymanchu.
No one could figure this out.	Kaytaqa manam pipas yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
They're ever so nice.	Paykunaqa hayk'aqpas ancha sumaqmi kanku.
They were never very happy.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha kusisqachu karqanku.
I don’t hear enough about it.	Manam chaymantaqa allintachu uyarini.
It sounds really awesome.	Chiqamanta manchay uyarikun.
It’s not the only thing there.	Manam chayllachu chaypiqa kachkan.
Everything has to go first.	Tukuy ima ñawpaqpi rinan tiyan.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	Payqa allintam yachan ima ruwasqanmanta.
Too much time passed.	Llumpay tiempo pasarqa.
I'm already.	Ñam kani.
What will be the reason?.	¿Imataq kanqa imarayku?.
Maybe that's stupid but there it is.	Ichapas chayqa sonso ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
I thought he would always be with me.	Yuyarqanin payqa sapa kutilla ñoqawan kananta.
I’ve heard that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi uyarirqani.
It seemed like something worthwhile.	Chayqa imapas allinpaq hinam karqa.
He tried to answer but couldn't.	Payqa kutichiyta munarqan ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
In fact, it seems kind of funny.	Chiqaptaqa, huk laya asikunapaq hinam rikchakun.
I was the insecure one.	Mana seguro kaqmi karqani.
Someone had to do all of that.	Tukuy chaykunataqa pipas ruwanan karqa.
After that they .	Chay qhepamanmi paykunaqa .
But it was a big if.	Ichaqa hatun sichus karqan.
We can’t get anywhere.	Manam maymanpas chayayta atichwanchu.
He is now a strange, cold thing.	Payqa kunanqa huk mana riqsisqa, chiri kaqmi.
He has a beautiful mind.	Payqa sumaq yuyayniyuqmi.
But one this was for sure.	Ichaqa huk kayqa seguro karqan.
Can you help me out? 	¿Atiwaqchu yanapayta?
For the most part, I am happy.	Yaqa llapanpim kusisqa kachkani.
I’m glad what happened.	Kusikuni imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I can’t say no either.	Ñuqapas manam mana niyta atiymanchu.
I can’t imagine.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinichu.
And you have to do something.	Hinaspa imatapas ruwanayki.
Whoever doesn’t do it right.	Pichus mana allinta ruwaq.
But then he said no.	Ichaqa chaymantam nirqa mana nispa.
This was the third one, but I don't care.	Kayqa kimsa kaqmi karqa, ichaqa manam imananpaschu.
Then maybe every other day.	Chaymantaqa ichapas sapa iskay punchaw.
So very young.	Chaymi ancha wayna.
There, there it is again.	Chaypi, chaypi yapamanta kachkan.
You don’t know, do you? 	Manachu yachanki, ¿aw?
I can't listen to the movie anymore.	Manañam chay peliculata uyariyta atinichu.
I was too busy for too long.	Ancha unayta llumpay ocupasqa karqani.
One of them was more aggressive.	Hukninmi aswan sinchita rimaq.
He said it was too much for him.	Payqa nirqanmi paypaq llumpay kasqanmanta.
Or a little sad.	Utaq huk chhikanta llakisqa.
You know all that.	Tukuy chayta yachanki.
He knew you weren’t human.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana runa kasqaykita.
This was bad, very bad.	Kayqa mana allinmi karqa, ancha mana allinmi karqa.
They were like travelers.	Paykunaqa puriq runakuna hinam karqaku.
He was sober all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi allin yuyayniyuq karqan.
Maybe he could have prevented it.	Ichapas harkayta atinman karqa.
He thought the problem would pass.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay sasachakuy pasananta.
I would love to have a chat with you.	Munaymanmi qamwan huk rimayta ruwayta.
I don't feel bad about it anymore at all.	Manañam chaymantaqa mana allintachu sientekuni ni imapipas.
So it has to be something like that.	Chaymi chayna imapas kanan.
I do things.	Imakunatapas ruwani.
It wasn't like him at all.	Manam pay hinachu karqa ni imapipas.
They are very, very nice.	Paykunaqa ancha, ancha sumaqmi kanku.
Do it without it.	Mana chaywan ruway.
He told me the right thing.	Payqa allintam niwarqa.
Tell me what you did.	Willaway ima ruwasqaykita.
Learn what it takes to do that.	Chayta ruwanapaq imakuna ruwananta yachay.
Probably better than me.	Yaqapaschá ñoqamanta aswan allinqa.
One was the other.	Hukninmi karqa huknin.
I do it many times!.	¡Achka kutim ruwani!.
Hardest ever.	Aswan sasa hayk’aqpas.
Every young person is.	Sapa wayna sipasmi.
But that’s what we did.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwarqayku.
I know it would have been hard.	Yachanim sasa kanman karqa.
There seems to be a lot to do.	Achka ruwanapaq hinam kachkan.
He wasn't sure he was right.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan allin kasqanmanta.
Instead, I enjoy it.	Aswanpas kusikuni.
No, he won’t go alone.	Manan, manan sapallanchu rinqa.
I probably did, yes.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani, arí.
This is where he gets a little tricky now.	Kaypim kunanqa huk chikan sasachakuypi tarikun.
Yes, but not a bit like yesterday.	Arí, ichaqa manan qayna p’unchay hinachu huk chhikanta.
But the next step is not there.	Ichaqa qatiqnin ruwayqa manan chaypichu kashan.
That would be really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi kanman.
They were very simple.	Paykunaqa ancha facilmi karqaku.
It was a great moment.	Hatun rato karqan.
That’s about everything.	Chayqa tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
We are very excited about this.	Kaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkaniku.
I feel really good about this.	Kaymantaqa chiqap allintam sientekuni.
Twenty years if you want.	Munaspaqa iskay chunka wata.
Now he can't walk.	Kunanqa manañam puriyta atinchu.
That’s pretty much me, too.	Chayqa yaqa ñuqapas.
He is the world.	Paymi kay pacha.
It’s the biggest in town.	Llaqtapi aswan hatunmi.
I thought you should, anyway.	Yuyarqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq, imayna kaptinpas.
One did his best.	Hukninmi tukuy atisqanman hina ruwarqa.
That’s what I like too.	Chayqa ñuqapas gustanmi.
It looked like a big city.	Chayqa hatun llaqtamanmi rikchakurqa.
The school of the future.	Hamuq pacha yachay wasi.
It was really bad.	Chiqap mana allinmi karqa.
I think that’s the way it is.	Chayna kananpaqmi piensani.
No one has ever been able to defeat him.	Manan pipas hayk'aqpas paytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.
This event was a big deal last year.	Kay ruwayqa qayna wata hatun ruwaymi karqan.
He wanted it, and he had to do it.	Payqa munarqanmi, chaytan ruwanan karqan.
More people were arrested.	Aswan achka runakunam hapisqa karqaku.
But some people are eager to work there.	Ichaqa wakin runakunaqa anchatam munanku chaypi llamkayta.
This is the letter.	Kaymi chay cartata.
But then they always are.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa sapa kutillanmi kanku.
It seemed fine with that.	Chaywanqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
But it has always been so.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
Very disappointed it didn’t work out.	Ancha hukmanyasqa mana allintachu ruwarqa.
I’ve got that, all the way.	Chayta hap’ini, tukuy ñanta.
So, don’t forget.	Chaymi, ama qunqaychu.
In fact, there is no one.	Chiqaptaqa manam pipas kanchu.
But, then, it was always there.	Ichaqa, chaymantaqa, ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
He seemed worried about what to do next.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa ima ruwananmanta.
You don’t want it right.	Mana allintachu munanki.
A handsome young man.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq wayna.
But this is not an easy task.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manan facil ruwaychu.
That should be pretty easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi kanan.
We had a party for him yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi paypaq fiestata ruwarqayku.
What's with that this year.	Imataq chaywan kay wata kachkan.
One person, two people.	Huk runa, iskay runa.
I don't know if it will happen anymore.	Manaña yachanichu kananmanta.
But he still found himself.	Ichaqa hinallam tarikurqa.
No, this would never be a good thing.	Manan, kayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
Innovation is innovation.	Musuq ruwayqa musuq ruwaymi.
I was happy to be around.	Ñuqaqa kusisqam tarikurqani.
You can't do much about it.	Chaymantaqa manam anchatachu ruwawaq.
And again, that’s people.	Hinaspa yapamanta, chaymi runakuna.
He doesn't want to see it.	Payqa manam qawayta munanchu.
I'm really looking forward to this.	Chiqaptam kayta suyachkani.
I'd rather not talk about this at all.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaymanta mana imapipas rimayqa.
But this is the second time.	Ichaqa kaymi iskay kaq kutipi.
That’s these people.	Chayqa kay runakuna.
You know what this is about.	Yachankim imamanta kayqa rimachkan.
It’s easier now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi.
There should be little action after that.	Chay qhepamanmi pisi ruway kanan.
But no one else can.	Ichaqa manan huk runaqa atinmanchu.
I will no longer be there to help.	Manañam chaypichu kasaq yanapanaypaq.
Every single moment of it.	Sapa sapa rato chaymanta.
This is simple, but not easy.	Kayqa facilmi, ichaqa manam facilchu.
In the house.	Chay wasipi.
But this is too broad.	Ichaqa kayqa llumpay hatunmi.
This last man is the greatest.	Kay qhepa kaq runaqa aswan hatunmi.
The famous one.	Chay riqsisqa kaq.
This process is in two steps.	Kay ruwayqa iskay ruwaypi kachkan.
I am a terrible, terrible person.	Ñuqaqa manchay, manchay runam kani.
Strong and ready.	Sinchi hinaspa listo.
Twenty years later.	Iskay chunka wata qhepamanmi.
No one is happy about that.	Chaymantaqa manam pipas kusisqachu kachkan.
But, okay .	Ichaqa, allinmi .
The second day is the worst.	Iskay kaq punchawmi aswan mana allinqa.
You're obviously angry.	Sut'inmi phiñasqa kashanki.
It’s been a long time.	Ancha unayñam.
I couldn’t say why.	Manam imarayku niyta atirqanichu.
Who is it that he is.	Pi kasqanmanta.
It’s just, you know, for you.	Chaylla, yachanki, qampaq.
Yeah, he thought maybe.	Arí, yuyaykurqanmi ichapas.
That's the most immediate thing to do.	Chayqa aswan chaylla ruwaymi.
That, of course, is wrong.	Chayqa, sut’inmi, mana allinchu.
It’s really neither here nor there.	Chiqaptaqa manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
This seems stupid.	Kayqa sonso hinam.
It’s like a crazy house there.	Chaypiqa loco wasi hinam.
He certainly knew the way.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ñanta yacharqan.
I just didn’t know why.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imarayku chayta.
That's why he was faster.	Chayraykum payqa aswan utqaylla karqa.
Maybe he was being unreasonable.	Ichapas payqa mana yuyayniyuq kachkarqa.
I don’t think it will happen again.	Manam yapamanta chayna kananta yuyanichu.
But that’s not really going to work.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa allin kanqa.
That’s why we’re there.	Chayraykum chaypi kanchik.
This isn't too bad.	Kayqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
He may have done it.	Payqa ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
I knew what I had to do.	Yacharqanim ima ruwanayta.
Ultimately it’s up to him.	Qhepamanmi paymanta kanqa.
He was a wonderful teacher.	Payqa sumaq yachachiqmi karqan.
I won’t do the talking.	Manam rimayta ruwasaqchu.
The one with the second opinion.	Iskay kaq yuyayniyuq kaq.
No, that’s not quite right.	Manan, chayqa manan allintachu.
Who knows what happened out there.	Pi yachan chay hawapi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I wasn’t that excited before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chayna kusisqachu karqani.
He might have been.	Payqa ichapas chayna kanman karqa.
I still feel really bad about it.	Kunankamapas chaymantaqa anchatam mana allintachu sientekuni.
Whatever, you know.	Imapas, yachanki.
A new process.	Huk musuq ruway.
Now he does that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwan.
It looks really nice.	Chiqamanta sumaq qhawarisqa.
There are two such methods.	Chayna iskay ruwaymi kan.
Every day will not be like this.	Sapa punchawmi mana kay hinachu kanqa.
I mean, it could have been him.	Niyta munani, paymi kanman karqan.
But he wants to do it.	Ichaqa munanmi chayta ruwayta.
This is just so ridiculous.	Kayqa ancha asikunapaq hinallam.
This seems to be very confusing.	Kayqa ancha pantasqa hinam kachkan.
Maybe that’s too much.	Ichapas chayqa ancha achka kanman.
Yes, you do, too.	Arí, qampas.
Sometimes but not always.	Wakin kuti ichaqa mana sapa kutichu.
Now, there are two options.	Kunanqa, iskay ruwaymi kan.
Maybe more people were there.	Ichapas aswan achka runakuna chaypi karqaku.
Hopefully you won't have to do that too often though.	Munaymanmi mana ancha sapa kutichu chayta ruwanaykipaq ichaqa.
It wasn't difficult, actually.	Manam sasachu karqa, chiqaptaqa.
However, it would be great.	Ichaqa, ancha allinmi kanman.
He was terribly nice about it.	Payqa manchay sumaqmi karqan chaymanta.
At least, probably.	Aswanpas, yaqapaschá.
I can't wait to play it again.	Manam suyayta atinichu hukmanta tocayta.
That wasn’t always a bad thing.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu mana allinchu karqan.
Glad it worked for you!!!.	Kusisqam kachkani qampaq allin kasqanmanta!!!.
He wouldn’t have done that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwanmanchu karqa.
Maybe you’re smart.	Ichapas yachaysapa kanki.
We are always hungry.	Sapa kutim yarqaymanta kayku.
He did just that.	Payqa chaytam ruwarqa.
I doubt he knows.	Iskayrayani yachasqanmanta.
He gave it to her.	Paymi chayta qorqan.
I don’t want to hear any more.	Manam astawan uyariyta munanichu.
It doesn’t mean much.	Mana anchatachu niyta munan.
Everything you really need to do.	Tukuy ima chiqamanta ruwanayki tiyan.
That makes sense of you.	Chayqa yuyayniyuqmi qammanta.
It’s too intelligent.	Llumpay yuyayniyuqmi.
It really wasn't that hard.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna sasachu karqa.
I don’t know why anyone would do that.	Mana yachanichu imanasqa pipas chayta ruwanman.
So then it makes no sense.	Chaymi chaymantaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I would like to come here.	Kayman hamuyta munayman.
So people are very important.	Chaymi runakunaqa ancha importante kanku.
I want to be the best in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan allin kaytam munani.
The bad is the bad.	Mana allinqa mana allinchu.
Nothing,’ he says.	Mana imapas’, nispas nin.
He certainly couldn’t do that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa mana atirqanchu.
I feel really good about it.	Chiqamanta allinta sientekuni chaymanta.
I do everything very quickly.	Tukuy imatam ancha utqaylla ruwani.
He couldn’t make it.	Manas chaymanqa chayayta atirqachu.
I am trying to do the right thing here.	Kaypiqa allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
He tried to be loud.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi sinchita rimananpaq.
I think there married now.	Yuyaykuni chaypi casarasqa kunan.
Go with him.	Paywan riy.
I was just disappointed.	Chayllaraqmi hukmanyasqa karqani.
He couldn't sit still.	Payqa manam maypipas tiyayta atirqachu.
But there is some wisdom.	Ichaqa kanmi wakin yachay.
Trying to think about it would be worse.	Chaypi yuyaymanayta munaspaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
It will be a terrible thing to do.	Manchay millay ruwaymi kanqa.
The first is to be a reasonable person.	Ñawpaq kaqmi allin yuyayniyuq runa kay.
They were never here.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypichu karqanku.
Bruised, bruised, bruised.	K’irisqa, k’irisqa, k’irisqa ima.
He was very happy.	Ancha kusisqa kasqa.
It will be a sad experience.	Llakikuypaqmi kanqa.
So they were good.	Chaymi paykunaqa allin karqanku.
He looked tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa qhawarisqa.
But that may not have been the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay hinachu karqan.
You are so, so, so stupid.	Qamqa chayna, chayna, ancha sonso kanki.
Clearly, something had to be done, and quickly.	Sut’inmi, imapas ruwana karqan, hinaspa usqhaylla ruwana karqan.
He really didn’t think straight.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana allintachu yuyaykurqan.
It’s that interesting, it’s .	Chayna sumaqmi, chayqa .
I'm just not really sure how.	Chaylla mana chiqaptachu seguro kani imayna kasqanmanta.
Maybe there was nothing about it.	Ichapas chaymantaqa mana imapas karqachu.
This was a beautiful summer.	Kayqa karqan sumaq chiri tiempo.
Therefore you will do well.	Chayraykum allinta ruwanki.
I want to make sure things are going to be okay.	Allinmi kanqa imapas pasasqanmanta seguro kaytam munani.
That’s how we used to talk.	Chaynatam rimaq kayku.
But he later refused to do so.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi mana chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqan.
This was the ultimate evil.	Kaymi karqan qhepa millay ruway.
Here’s how it looks.	Kaypi imayna kasqanmanta.
No, he said, 'It's not.	Manan, nispas nisqa.
Isn’t it?' 	¿Manachu?’, nispa.
First, something happened.	Ñawpaqtaqa imapas pasarqa.
They are both married.	Iskayninkum casarasqa kachkanku.
That went on most of the morning.	Chayqa yaqa llapan paqarinmi pasarqa.
We don’t have a name.	Mana sutiyuq kayku.
So we had to do it.	Chaymi ruwanayku karqa.
I’d love to hear your thoughts.	Anchatan munani uyariyta yuyaykusqaykita.
Explain why this is important to you.	Willay imanasqa chay ruway qampaq ancha allin kasqanmanta.
And do it again tomorrow.	Hinaspa paqarin yapamanta ruway.
You are the best out there.	Qamqa chay hawapi aswan allinqa kanki.
I can’t understand why not.	Mana entiendeyta atinichu imarayku mana chayta.
But, of course you know it.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yachanki.
What should I do.	Imatataq ruwanay.
Perhaps he was.	Yaqapaschá payqa karqan.
And now it’s here.	Hinaspa kunanqa kaypi kachkan.
He knew what they were.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna kasqankuta.
I’m not unhappy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa mana kusisqachu kani.
That was very clear tonight.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan kunan tuta.
It was probably mine.	Yaqapaschá ñuqapa karqa.
You can’t drive a car.	Manam carrota manejayta atiwaqchu.
One by one now.	Hukmanta hukmanta kunan.
I know that’s the way it is.	Ñuqaqa chaynatam yachani.
Craziness is not a good thing.	Loco kayqa manam allinchu.
It wasn't really that cold that day.	Chay punchawqa manam chiqaptachu chayna chiri karqa.
That was a partial reality.	Chayqa huk chikan cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Here we are, folks.	Kaypi kachkaniku, runakuna.
At least, sometimes.	Aswanpas, wakin kuti.
A beautiful newcomer like you.	Qan hina sumaq musuq hamuq.
This should be absurdly fast.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq utqaylla kanan tiyan.
But this is what he will do.	Ichaqa kaytan ruwanqa.
I am glad to be a teacher.	Kusikuni yachachiq kasqaymanta.
I sure don’t want that to happen.	Seguro mana munanichu chayna kananta.
But that’s not the worst part of it.	Ichaqa manan chaypaqqa aswan mana allinqa.
So much easier to do things.	Chaymi aswan facil imatapas ruway.
And that everything would happen.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas pasananta.
But things will work out.	Ichaqa imapas allinmi kanqa.
He finally speaks.	Payqa tukukuypi riman.
He knew nothing like that would happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chay hina imapas pasananta.
I can’t bear to think about it.	Manam aguantayta atinichu chaypi yuyaymanayta.
This approach is popular but ineffective.	Kay ruwayqa ancha riqsisqa ichaqa mana allinchu.
This is convenient, fast and seamless.	Kayqa allinmi, utqaylla hinaspa mana pantasqa.
That was difficult to do.	Chaytaqa sasam karqa.
It was obvious I wanted to.	Sut’inmi karqan munasqayta.
No. He can't see now.	Mana kunanqa mana rikuyta atinchu.
It was rather obvious.	Aswanpas sut’inmi karqan.
There are two ways to do this.	Chaypaqqa iskay ruwaymi kanman.
But I think it’s going to be nice like this.	Ichaqa kay hinaqa sumaqmi kanqa, nispan yuyaykuni.
Where do you want it.	Maypitaq munanki.
Do what you can.	Ruway atisqaykita.
Not as bad as being scared or angry.	Mana mana allinchu mancharisqa utaq phiñasqa hina.
If that doesn’t work, try something else.	Chay mana allin kaptinqa hukta ruway.
But act quickly.	Ichaqa chaylla imatapas ruway.
I'm just not sure what.	Chaylla mana segurochu kani imamanta.
I mean after all, it could always be worse.	Niyta munani tukuy imamanta, sapa kuti aswan mana allin kanman.
Not better than not.	Mana aswan allinchu mana.
I still am, actually.	Hinallam kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I couldn’t ignore that.	Chaytaqa manan mana uyariyta atirqanichu.
The man things.	Chay runa imakuna.
He would be there now.	Payqa kunanmi chaypi kanman.
It will probably be good.	Yaqapaschá allin kanqa.
He’s not feeling well.	Payqa mana allintachu tarikun.
He can’t say that.	Payqa manan chayta niyta atinmanchu.
You know that it is.	Yachankim chayna kasqanmanta.
We’re there together.	Kuska chaypi kanchik.
Maybe he will, someday.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman, huk punchaw.
It’s not like this new one.	Manam kay musuq hinachu.
But here they were.	Ichaqa kaypim karqaku.
This would be a very unwise thing to do.	Kayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi kanman.
But he noticed it.	Ichaqa repararqanmi.
I hope he will be very happy.	Suyachkani ancha kusisqa kananta.
Maybe it was the smartest thing.	Ichapas aswan yachaysapa kaq karqa.
I feel nervous all the time.	Tukuy tiempon mancharisqa sientekuni.
Another person is not good.	Huk runa mana allin.
This never worked out well.	Kayqa manam haykapipas allintachu lluqsirqa.
But this was not true.	Ichaqa manan kayqa cheqaqchu karqan.
It’s just ridiculous, that’s all.	Asikunapaq hinallam, chayllam.
No one to be there for you.	Mana pipas chaypi qampaq kananpaq.
I didn’t see it.	Mana rikurqanichu.
He seemed to stop talking.	Payqa manaña rimananpaq hinam karqa.
It sounds so absurd.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi uyarikun.
They want to win now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi atipayta munanku.
It was an easier time.	Aswan facil tiempon karqan.
But I can’t believe it.	Ichaqa manan creeyta atinichu.
Not sure if this is a bug or something else.	Mana segurochu kayqa huk pantasqa icha huk imapas.
But don’t forget the coffee.	Ichaqa ama qunqaychu chay kukata.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Mana yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
You made him to do it.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi payta ruwarqanki.
One cannot stop him.	Huk runaqa manan hark’ayta atinmanchu.
You are a man who lives in the world.	Kay pachapi tiyaq runam kanki.
But this was by no means a scholar.	Ichaqa kayqa manan imapipas yachaysapa runachu karqan.
He was caught wrong.	Payqa mana allintachu hap’isqa karqan.
I really don’t know what to make of it.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu imatachus chaymanta ruwanayta.
I think he did a great job.	Yuyaykuni hatun llamkayta ruwasqanmanta.
I have a better idea than that.	Ñuqaqa chaymantaqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I was the bad guy.	Ñuqam mana allin kaq karqani.
It’s all for you.	Lliwmi qampaq.
It was a terribly lonely time.	Chayqa karqan manchay sapallan pacha.
And he looks hungry.	Hinaspa yarqaymanta rikchakun.
He opened a back door and opened it.	Huk qhipa punkuta kicharirqa, kicharirqa.
That person can do that.	Chay runaqa chayta ruwanman.
Don’t be irrelevant.	Ama mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Tell me quickly.	Usqhaylla willaway.
You want to be positive.	Allin yuyayniyuq kaytam munanki.
Such disagreement is acceptable.	Chayna mana acuerdopi kayqa allinmi.
Obviously, it can’t be safe.	Sut’inmi, manan segurochu kanman.
But that is a very bad thing to do.	Ichaqa chayna ruwayqa ancha mana allinmi.
That’s all there is to do here.	Chayllam kaypi ruwana.
Probably the worst part.	Yaqapaschá aswan mana allinqa.
No, nothing much.	Manan, manan imapas anchatachu.
He did extremely well.	Payqa sinchi allintan ruwarqan.
He couldn’t have spoken properly.	Payqa manan allintachu rimayta atinman karqan.
At first he didn’t really want to see her.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan anchatachu payta rikuyta munarqan.
That’s the action.	Chayqa ruwaymi.
What’s more, he was cold.	Imataq aswan, payqa chiri kasqa.
One day it will happen.	Huk punchawmi chayna kanqa.
That’s what he planned to do with it.	Chaytan payqa chaywan ruwayta yuyaykurqan.
I’m very intelligent.	Ancha yuyayniyuqmi kani.
And obviously that's what he's done.	Hinaspa sut'inmi chay ruwasqanqa.
There seems to be a lot of confusion.	Achka pantasqa hinam kachkan.
Bigger and bigger and bigger.	Aswan hatun hinaspa aswan hatun hinaspa aswan hatun.
It can’t be that bad, for sure.	Manan chay hina mana allinchu kanman, seguro.
We did a lot of it.	Achkatam ruwarqayku.
There are a lot of good people out there.	Achka allin runakunam chaypi kachkan.
Obviously, they weren’t happy.	Sut’inmi, paykunaqa manan kusisqachu karqanku.
But it was a huge undertaking.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi karqan.
It wasn’t terribly bad or anything.	Manam manchay mana allinchu karqa nitaq imapas.
He wasn’t sure.	Manam segurochu karqa.
At the time, this seemed ridiculous.	Chay tiempopiqa kayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
And that’s hard to do.	Hinaspa chayta ruwayqa sasa.
But if you’re scared.	Ichaqa mancharisqa kashanki chayqa.
He never really wanted it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas anchatachu munarqan.
It would not be very appropriate to discuss this here.	Kaypiqa mana ancha allinchu kanman kaymanta rimayqa.
Does anyone know how to do it.	¿Pipas yachanchu imayna ruwayta.
Maybe not always.	Ichapas mana sapa kutichu.
But that is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa allinmi.
There was no repeat performance that night.	Chay tutaqa manam yapamanta ruwayqa karqachu.
Greater results.	Aswan hatun ruwaykunata.
I didn't have time to do much more than that.	Manam tiempoy karqachu chaymanta aswan achkata ruwanaypaq.
But he is happy most of the time.	Ichaqa yaqa tukuy tiempon kusisqa kashan.
I couldn’t do that either.	Ñoqapas manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
Not only that, maybe a day or two longer.	Mana chayllachu, ichapas huk utaq iskay punchaw aswan unayta.
He got away with it that way.	Payqa chaynatam chaymanta lluqsirqa.
There is nothing left here.	Kaypiqa manañam imapas kanchu.
Do the simplest thing.	Aswan sasa kaqta ruway.
At least it looks brand new.	Aswanpas musuq hinam rikchakun.
But you did the right thing.	Ichaqa allintam ruwarqanki.
Instead, he refused to leave.	Aswanpas manan ripuyta munarqanchu.
You are almost .	Qamqa yaqa .
You know, something like that.	Yachanki, imapas chayna.
Maybe it’s better.	Ichapas aswan allinqa kanman.
So don’t be too long.	Chaymi ama unaytachu.
It is very, very soon to say.	Ancha ancha utqayllam niyta.
It’s available all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kan.
He talked about it every night.	Sapa tutan chaymanta rimaq.
Nothing wrong, nothing was wrong.	Manam imapas mana allinchu, manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I hope you can bear it here.	Suyachkani kaypi aguantayta atisqaykita.
He looked rather tired.	Payqa aswan sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa.
You will never be me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqachu kanki.
Of course, you do.	Chiqamanta, qamqa ruwanki.
They have known this for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñam yachanku.
You had a lot to do.	Achkatam ruwanaykipaq karqa.
I don't know how else to figure this out.	Manam yachanichu imaynata hukmanta kayta yuyaymanayta.
The other type.	Huknin laya.
Would you like to have that.	¿Munawaqchu chayta.
He thought he was better than her.	Payqa paymanta aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
But that would be a better approach.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I would be happier if I was there.	Aswan kusisqa kayman chaypi kaspayqa.
There has to be something else.	Huk imapas kanan.
I focus on doing my best.	Tukuy atisqayta ruwaypi yuyaykuni.
I’m happier that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan kusisqan kashani.
Instead, he looked at it carefully.	Aswanpas allintan qhawarirqan.
But you didn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nirqanki.
You know, it's not that bad.	Yachanki, manam chayna mana allinchu.
It’s better than here if you do that.	Aswan allinmi kaymanta chayta ruwaspaqa.
That’s your thing.	Chayqa qampa imapas.
Larger than the city.	Llaqtamanta aswan hatun.
I saw one here.	Kaypi hukta rikurqani.
The sicker the sicker.	Aswan unqusqa aswan unqusqa.
Very excited.	Ancha kusisqa.
It makes a lonely way.	Sapallan ñanta ruwan.
That’s what he is now.	Chayqa kunanmi payqa.
I didn’t know about it.	Mana chaymanta yacharqanichu.
And he would be, eventually.	Hinaspa payqa kanman, qhepaman.
No no no no better than that.	Mana mana mana mana chaymanta aswan allin.
That was, it was good.	Chayqa karqa, allinmi karqa.
These people are wicked people.	Kay runakunaqa millay runakunam.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Payqa manan segurochu karqan munasqanmanta.
I wonder why he did that.	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa.
It’s okay with him.	Allinmi paywan.
Maybe a little drunk.	Ichapas huk chikan machasqa.
He’s probably.	Payqa yaqapaschá.
Not eating outside.	Mana hawapi mikhuy.
It’s there every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaypi kachkan.
He would always be out there.	Payqa sapa kutim hawapi kanman.
Two, actually.	Iskay, chiqaptaqa.
Of course, nothing like that.	Arí, manan imapas chay hinachu.
He began to think.	Payqa yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa.
And they’re crazy.	Hinaspa paykunaqa loco kanku.
One of them anyway.	Hukninmi imayna kaptinpas.
Anything other than that action.	Imapas mana chay ruwaychu.
I really think that is important.	Chiqaptam chayqa ancha allin kasqanmanta piensani.
I can find no mention of it anywhere.	Manam maypipas chaymanta rimayta tarinichu.
I mean, you're a nice guy.	Niyta munani, qamqa sumaq runam kanki.
But it makes no sense now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imapaqpas valenchu.
I would have to agree.	Ñoqaqa acuerdopi kanay kanman.
Maybe it was foolishness.	Ichapas mana yuyayniyuq kay karqa.
He couldn't say how.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu imaynatachus chayta.
For a while, anyway, it was.	Huk rato, imayna kaptinpas, chayna kasqa.
I'm really not good at this.	Chiqaptam kaypiqa mana allinchu kani.
But there was one thing, one thing .	Ichaqa huk kaqmi karqa, huk kaqmi .
Maybe two, twenty.	Ichapas iskay, iskay chunka.
I couldn’t figure out how to do it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imayna ruwanaypaq.
It’s not the best, you know.	Manam aswan allinchu, yachanki.
He spoke of you.	Paymi qanmanta rimarqan.
This guy is a big villain.	Kay runaqa hatun millay runam.
You better be successful.	Aswan allinmi kanman allinta ruwanaykipaq.
They were all excellent.	Llapallankum ancha allin karqaku.
It really is that good.	Chiqaptam chayna allinqa.
I do, actually.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, chiqaptaqa.
You don’t want this.	Manam kayta munankichu.
That seems pretty bad.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
They want to be smarter.	Paykunaqa aswan yachaysapa kaytam munanku.
Next year, maybe, if all goes well.	Hamuq wata, ichapas, tukuy imapas allin kaptinqa.
The lowest in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan pisi kaq.
It may not be the case.	Manapaschá hinachu kanman.
We took a walk.	Huk puriyta ruwarqayku.
He told her to come there.	Chayman hamunanta nisqa.
And that’s the man.	Hinaspa chay runa.
So, however, it may not be a good idea.	Chaymi ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
You’re the last person to do that.	Qanmi kanki qhepa kaq runa chayta ruwanayki.
About three in the afternoon.	Yaqa kimsa tarde.
Maybe it’s for me.	Ichapas ñuqapaq kanman.
But he could not tell the truth.	Ichaqa manan cheqaq kaqta willayta atirqanchu.
You want to ask this, that, everything.	Kayta, chayta, tukuy imatapas tapuyta munanki.
Daily! 	¡Sapa punchaw!
That’s what he is.	Chay payqa.
He knew it was too big.	Payqa yacharqanmi ancha hatun kasqanmanta.
I know how hard this is.	Yachanim kay imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
I feel safe and secure.	Allintam hinaspa segurom tarikuni.
Anyway, here you go.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim rinki.
I hope something comes of this.	Suyachkani kaymanta imapas hamunanta.
I can't bear to think about it for very long.	Manam aguantayta atinichu ancha unayta chaypi yuyaymanayta.
He did very well and excelled in every way.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa, tukuy imapipas allintam ruwarqa.
I don’t want to be difficult here.	Manam kaypiqa sasa kayta munanichu.
The man did nothing to help her.	Chay runaqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu payta yanapananpaq.
You’re not going to be like that.	Manan chay hinachu kanki.
Something is very difficult for you.	Imapas ancha sasam qampaq.
He was a very depressed man.	Payqa ancha llakisqa runam karqa.
I feel less tired.	Aswan pisi sayk’usqa sientekuni.
It’s hard to overstate that.	Chayta llumpayta rimayqa sasam.
Not at all! 	¡Manan!
not! 	mana!
You know he's a he.	Yachankim payqa huk pay kasqanmanta.
They were so nice, which made everything better.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku, chaymi tukuy imatapas aswan allinta ruwarqa.
Not wrong, angry.	Mana pantasqa, phiñasqa.
So you want to work.	Chaymi llamkayta munanki.
I have to be the strong one.	Sinchi kaqmi kanay.
Nothing will ever quite do that.	Manam imapas haykapipas chaytaqa allintachu ruwanqa.
This is probably where you are.	Kayqa yaqapaschá maypichus kashanki.
He really thought of everything.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin tukuy imamanta yuyaykurqan.
To be someone very important to him.	Paypaq ancha importante runa kananpaq.
Maybe in the future.	Ichapas hamuq tiempopi.
But he knows things.	Ichaqa yachanmi imakunatapas.
But then something goes wrong.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa imapas mana allinchu.
And something just happened.	Hinaspa imapas chayllaraq pasarqa.
I’m located there.	Chaypim tarikuni.
Maybe that’s what he meant.	Ichapas chayta niyta munarqa.
It didn't look right, not right at all.	Manam allintachu rikchakurqa, manam allinchu ni imapipas.
Hopefully next year will be better.	Munaymanmi hamuq wata aswan allin kananta.
You can’t be this.	Manam qamqa kayta atiwaqchu.
Man, he’s a good player.	Runa, payqa allin pukllaqmi.
He can’t do it.	Manam atinchu.
Maybe that mattered, maybe not.	Ichapas chayqa importante karqa, manapaschá.
They know that the world is something real.	Paykunaqa yachanku kay pacha imapas chiqap kasqanmanta.
There is really nothing and no one here.	Kaypiqa manam chiqaptachu imapas nitaq pipas.
That sounds a little crazy.	Chayqa huk chikan loco hinam uyarikun.
I thought the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan yuyaykurqani.
I don’t know, sadly.	Manam yachanichu, llakisqa.
Who is this guy? 	¿Pitaq kay runa?
Now he was angry, scared and devastated.	Kunanqa phiñasqa, mancharisqa, sinchi llakisqa ima kasqa.
That’s why he was famous.	Chayraykum payqa riqsisqa karqa.
But it’s not terribly true.	Ichaqa manan manchay cheqaqchu.
Now it was sad.	Kunanqa llakikuypaqmi karqan.
I don’t think this is a good thing.	Manam kayqa allin kananpaqchu yuyani.
A lot of things are beautiful.	Achka imapas sumaqmi.
We did that a few times.	Chaytaqa iskay kinsa kutitan ruwarqayku.
They were scared and frightened.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima karqanku.
Tell someone what you want.	Pimanpas munasqaykita willay.
But someone will come to it.	Ichaqa pipas chayman hamunqa.
He is a better man than I am.	Payqa ñoqamanta aswan allin runan.
It doesn’t matter about anything.	Manan imananpaschu imamantapas.
What are these things.	Imataq kaykunaqa.
Can't remember what it is now.	Mana yuyariyta atinchu kunan ima kasqanmanta.
She was very, very nice.	Payqa ancha, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It is very easy to do this.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
I’ve hardly ever heard of him.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
You know what is important.	Yachankim imakuna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
That seems reasonable.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam.
But it’s really a very difficult thing to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin ancha sasa ruway.
You’re tired of it.	Qamqa sayk’usqa kanki.
That was really good for me.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi ñuqapaq karqa.
One makes a memory.	Hukninmi yuyariyta ruwan.
Good as new said.	Musuq hina allin nisqa.
He doesn’t need much.	Payqa manan anchatachu necesitan.
He always couldn't answer.	Payqa sapa kutim mana kutichiyta atinmanchu karqa.
You may be a good or bad speaker.	Ichapas allin utaq mana allin rimaq kanki.
I didn’t hear it right.	Mana allintachu uyarirqani.
He will soon be hungry.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan yarqasqa kanqa.
Maybe an hour or two would be fine.	Ichapas huk iskay hora allin kanman.
I can’t say what will happen now.	Manam niyta atiymanchu kunan imakuna pasananta.
He is eventually arrested.	Qhepamanmi hap’isqa kashan.
I would love to see more of this.	Munaymanmi kaymanta astawan qawayta.
Everything for you.	Tukuy ima qampaq.
That means eating well for a long time.	Chayqa unayta allinta mikhuyta niyta munan.
We talked most of the day.	Yaqa llapan punchawmi rimaq kayku.
There is one though.	Chaypin kan huk ichaqa.
I wanted to talk to him this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi paywan rimayta munarqani.
I think I’m trying to stop him.	Payta hark’ayta munasqayta yuyaykuni.
Somewhere like that.	Maypipas chayna.
It's almost ridiculous to have that stuff.	Yaqa asikunapaq hinam chay imapas kananpaq.
But that is only the first time.	Ichaqa chaytaqa ñawpaq kutillanmi.
He is in a state of unconsciousness.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kachkan.
He died very hard.	Payqa ancha sinchitan wañupurqan.
That was pretty much the worst part.	Chayqa yaqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
It happened once before.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk kutim pasarqa.
And now this is it.	Hinaspa kunanqa kayqa kachkan.
They are three in number.	Paykunaqa kimsa kanku.
He barely speaks.	Payqa yaqapaschá riman.
But that didn’t mean much.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa anchatachu niyta munarqan.
I can't imagine why, but there it is.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinichu imarayku, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
I went twice.	Iskay kutitam rirqani.
Easy, that one.	Facil, chay huknin.
He seemed so happy tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
First of all, it’s not true.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan cheqaqchu.
Do this for about a month.	Chaytaqa huk killa hinata ruway.
The youngest one still does.	Sullk’a kaqmi kunankamapas chayta ruwan.
Many, many people.	Achka, achka runakuna.
Maybe he was stupid.	Ichapas payqa sonso karqa.
In this problem.	Kay sasachakuypi.
No, he said, it had to be.	Manan, nispas nin, chaymi kanan karqan.
Which seems to be the case here.	Imataq kaypiqa kanman hina.
It would be very unpleasant.	Ancha mana allinchu kanman.
One by one, one by one.	Huk hukmanta.
So, it was true.	Chaymi, chiqap karqa.
They may not always be the most effective.	Manapaschá chayllachu aswan allin ruwaq kanku.
Obviously it’s not good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu.
I saw no one, heard nothing.	Mana pitapas rikurqanichu, mana imatapas uyarirqanichu.
Why this some practice.	Imaraykutaq kay wakin ruway.
I couldn’t sleep that night.	Chay tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
Now it’s up to you.	Kunanqa qanmanta.
Not me, not anyone.	Mana ñuqachu, mana pipas.
He could not bear them.	Chaykunataqa manam aguantayta atirqachu.
Maybe tomorrow will be a good day.	Ichapas paqarin allin punchaw kanman.
It has always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi karqa.
You don’t know yet.	Qamqa manaraqmi yachankichu.
But he went away.	Ichaqa rirqa.
Isn't it ?.	¿Manachu ?.
I thought about it carefully.	Chaypin allinta yuyaykurqani.
If so, here it is again.	Chayna kaptinqa kaypim yapamanta kachkan.
Is that a good thing to do, or is there a better way.	Allinchu chay ruway, icha aswan allin ruwaychu kan.
This is the problem here.	Kaymi kaypi sasachakuy.
He will make things work.	Payqa imatapas allinta ruwananpaqmi ruwanqa.
Probably really hard to know.	Yaqapaschá chiqaptapuni sasa yachay.
I have no idea what happened to it.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna chaywan pasasqanmanta.
Maybe a .	Ichapas huk .
The nicest people in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan sumaq runakuna.
I didn’t want to talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta munarqanichu.
He was very clearly alone.	Payqa ancha sut’inmi sapallan kasharqan.
Perhaps he knew.	Yaqapaschá payqa yacharqa.
That’s not going to work.	Chayqa manan allintachu ruwanqa.
He wants to know something.	Payqa imatapas yachayta munan.
He knows exactly what he means.	Payqa allintan yachan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He wants to believe that’s all there is to it.	Chaylla kasqanpi creeyta munan.
No one knows where.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi.
He can’t walk.	Payqa manan puriyta atinchu.
I immediately felt happy.	Chayllam kusisqa tarikurqani.
I feel so lucky to have him.	Ancha suerteyoqmi sientekuni paywan kasqaymanta.
Everything is fresh and new.	Tukuy ima musuq, musuq.
It probably should be.	Yaqapaschá kanan.
He seemed disappointed in me.	Payqa hukmanyasqa hinam karqa ñuqamanta.
But you’re crazy.	Ichaqa loco kanki.
That's all, that's it.	Chaylla, chaymi.
But you still agree that it doesn't.	Ichaqa hinallam acuerdopi kanki mana chayna kasqanmanta.
It should be a good practice.	Allin ruwaymi kanan.
Can’t do it, man.	Mana ruwayta atinchu, runa.
Some of the other people.	Wakin wakin runakuna.
This was the first major event.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq hatun ruway.
I am bigger than you.	Qammanta aswan hatunmi kani.
It was a good thing, he said.	Allinmi karqa, nispa.
That’s it again and again.	Chayqa hukmanta yapamanta.
I was fine, sort of.	Ñuqaqa allintam karqani, huk laya.
He wishes it never happened.	Payqa munanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayna kananta.
He is busy today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ocupasqa kachkan.
Anyway, that's about him.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaymantam payqa.
Make that the first step.	Chayta ñawpaq kaq ruway.
I was happy too.	Ñuqapas kusisqam tarikurqani.
And then came a moment of truth.	Hinaspa chaymanta hamurqan huk rato cheqaq kaq.
He will do what he says he will do.	Nisqanman hinallam ruwanqa.
Some more coffee would be useful here.	Wakin aswan kukata kaypi allin kanman.
So much is out there.	Chaymi achka kachkan hawapi.
That certainly does.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ruwan.
But something else is at work.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi llank’ashan.
Bigger is better though.	Hatunmi aswan allin ichaqa.
I really didn’t want to be alone.	Chiqaptaqa manam sapallay kayta munarqanichu.
You’ve always done that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwarqanki.
Obviously it should be.	Sut’inmi chay hina kanan.
They were so good.	Chayna allin karqaku.
I couldn’t speak anymore.	Manañam rimayta atirqanichu.
I could not bear this.	Kaytaqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu.
Hopefully it would be better.	Munaymanmi aswan allin kanman.
No one seemed drunk yet.	Manaraqmi pipas machasqa hinachu karqa.
This was a very sad experience.	Kayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
But it will be difficult.	Ichaqa sasam kanqa.
Everything seemed as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam rikchakurqa.
Did a little bit of work.	Huk chikan llamkayta ruwarqa.
That needs to happen now.	Chayqa kunanmi kanan.
I really, really hope this happens.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam suyachkani kay pasananta.
And that’s what he is.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa.
That makes me feel better.	Chayqa aswan allintam sientekuni.
That will make it better.	Chaywanmi allin kanqa.
He almost always did.	Yaqa sapa kutim chayta ruwaq.
He was left alone, at home.	Payqa sapallanmi qhepakurqan, wasipi.
He died in hospital a few hours later.	Payqa iskay kinsa hora qhepamanmi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
Everything was a process in one way or another.	Tukuy imapas huk utaq huk ruwaypi huk ruwaymi karqa.
But then again, maybe he did.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
It doesn’t mean it should be for you.	Manam niyta munanchu qampaq chayna kananta.
That’s the first one.	Chayqa ñawpaq.
It is wrong to harm another.	Hukta mana allinta ruwayqa manam allinchu.
So no one cares.	Chayraykum mana pipas imananpaschu.
All this ugliness.	Tukuy kay millay kay.
Most of the time, anyway.	Yaqa llapanpim, imayna kaptinpas.
And he was angry about it.	Hinan chaymanta phiñasqa kasharqan.
But he never will.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu.
I think a few people were surprised.	Yuyaykuni huk iskay kimsa runakuna admirasqa kasqankuta.
I’m really worried about you.	Chiqamanta llakisqa kachkani qammanta.
I just didn’t want to hear it.	Chaylla mana uyariyta munarqanichu.
Very happy about it.	Ancha kusisqa chaymanta.
I think it was a very difficult time.	Yuyaykuni ancha sasa tiempo kasqanmanta.
Now he will do well.	Kunanqa allintam ruwanqa.
He knew he could do this.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
But he wouldn’t want me to.	Ichaqa manan munanmanchu karqan chayta ruwanayta.
That is a bad thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
Now I feel it.	Kunanqa sientekuni.
I will continue to be here.	Hinallam kaypi kasaq.
In most cases, it is almost .	Yaqa llapanpim yaqa .
I'm not quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
After all, he had an idea.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa yuyayniyuq karqa.
But, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa, manan sapa kutichu chay hinaqa.
He said he didn't want to go.	Payqa nirqam mana riyta munasqanmanta.
Building.	Hatun wasi.
He did a great job with it.	Chaywanmi hatun llamkayta ruwarqa.
Will it ever be.	¿Hayk'aqllapas.
I feel confused about everything.	Tukuy imamanta mana yuyayniyuq tarikuni.
He’s not good enough for you.	Payqa manan qanpaq allinchu.
Everything is so simple.	Tukuy imapas ancha facilmi.
Like everything else in town.	Llaqtapi tukuy imakuna hina.
This sounds reasonable.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi uyarikun.
You don't know anything well.	Manam imatapas allintachu yachanki.
Yes, you should do that.	Arí, chaytaqa ruwanayki.
This process has been going on for a long time.	Kay ruwayqa unayñam kachkan.
Everyone was there.	Tukuy chaypi karqanku.
So smart, so innocent.	Ancha yachaysapa, chayna mana huchayoq.
That there was no one there.	Chaypi mana pipas kasqanmanta.
Because I’m alone.	Sapallan kasqaymanta.
Perhaps he will fail.	Ichapas payqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
An hour ago.	Huk hora ñawpaqta.
Everything is kind of .	Tukuy imapas huk laya .
If, in fact, it meant anything.	Sichus, chiqaptaqa, imapas niyta munarqa.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaymanta seguro kasharqan.
They are good though.	Paykunaqa allinmi kanku ichaqa.
He’s a really big deal.	Payqa chiqap hatun ruwaymi.
He was gone all day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi manaña karqachu.
That would have been quick.	Chayqa usqhayllan kanman karqan.
I don’t want that here.	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa munanichu.
Not sure, not sure.	Mana segurochu, mana segurochu.
I can’t get over it.	Manam chaymantaqa atipayta atiymanchu.
A little too sure.	Huk chikan ancha seguro.
He wants to be this.	Payqa kaytam munan.
I will do this again and again.	Kaytaqa yapamanta yapamanta ruwasaq.
But I don’t like it.	Ichaqa manan gustanchu.
I couldn't stand much more.	Manam aswan achkata aguantayta atirqanichu.
Now he does about it.	Kunanmi chaymantaqa ruwan.
You were there one night.	Qamqa huk tutam chaypi karqanki.
Forgive me again.	Hukmanta pampachaykuway.
For the sake of the future.	Hamuq pacha allin kananpaq.
He didn’t need or want it.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu nitaq munarqanchu.
He was very happy for me.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa ñuqapaq.
Perhaps more importantly.	Ichapas aswan importante.
That’s what he said.	Chaytaqa nirqa.
I wasn't happy about it either.	Ñuqapas manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu karqani.
I didn’t do it in time.	Chaytaqa manan tiempollanpichu ruwarqani.
That and do it.	Chayqa hinaspa ruway.
Ideally it would be bigger.	Allinmi kanman aswan hatun.
Money was the most important thing.	Qolqetan aswan importante karqan.
He doesn't know what time it is.	Payqa manam yachanchu ima hora kasqanmantaqa.
No one could figure it out.	Manam pipas chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
So, a human being.	Chaymi, huk runa.
Eventually you will do what you can to succeed.	Qhepamanmi atisqaykita ruwanki allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Nothing seemed much better about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
I'd be married.	Casarasqa kayman.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu chaytaqa ruwarqan.
And that’s what did it for me.	Hinaspa chaymi ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
And, well, me.	Hinaspa, allinmi, ñuqa.
Most of the time, it was bad.	Yaqa llapanpim mana allin kaq.
He didn’t say much of anything.	Payqa manan imatapas anchatachu rimarqan.
John wanted nothing to do with it.	Juanqa manan chaypiqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.
He said no, not exactly.	Payqa manan nirqanchu, manan allintachu.
I didn’t want another party.	Manam huk fiestata munarqanichu.
But here he had no choice.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
That was always the case.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
It’s good for once.	Huk kutilla allin.
Everyone was cold.	Lliwmi chiri karqaku.
He never seemed mean or malicious.	Manam haykapipas millay nitaq mana allin ruwaq hinachu karqa.
Everyone looked at him.	Tukuy payta qhawarisqa.
But then he didn’t need it anymore.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manañan necesitarqanchu.
He is the one who makes things happen.	Paymi imakunatapas ruwan.
On a bicycle.	Bicicletapi.
I'm sure no one is.	Seguro kani mana pipas kasqanmanta.
We pretty much sat outside all the time.	Yaqapaschá tukuy tiempo hawapi tiyaq kayku.
I can’t wait that long.	Manam chay unayta suyayta atiymanchu.
He was colder than that, always refused.	Payqa aswan chiri karqan chaymanta, sapa kuti mana munarqanchu.
I can’t share this information with anyone.	Kay willayta mana pimanpas willayta atiymanchu.
He did it faster.	Payqa aswan utqayllam ruwarqa.
I hope to do some things better.	Suyachkani wakin ruwaykunata aswan allinta ruwayta.
And he’s terrified.	Hinaspa mancharisqa kachkan.
He treated her better.	Payqa aswan allintan paytaqa qhawarirqan.
He didn’t know it was wrong.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu mana allinchu kashasqanmanta.
It is hard to overstate the importance of this.	Chay ancha allin kasqanmantaqa sasam llumpayta rimayqa.
So, very tired.	Chaymi, ancha sayk’usqa.
I can probably fix it.	Yaqapaschá allichayta atiyman.
Everything was too fast.	Tukuy imapas llumpay utqayllam karqa.
This is not the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu.
Happy and joyful, often.	Kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa, achka kutipi.
Man you did well.	Runa allinta ruwarqanki.
Not really sure what's wrong with that.	Mana chiqap segurochu chaypi ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t want to live there.	Payqa manan munanchu chaypi tiyayta.
Then he came, happy as always.	Chaymantam hamurqa, sapa kuti hina kusisqa.
There it is again.	Chaypim yapamanta kachkan.
And he was worried about her.	Hinaspa payqa paymanta llakisqa kasqa.
So tell me about it.	Chaymi chaymanta willaway.
Do it or not.	Ruway icha mana.
The night would be great.	Tutaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
But that doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa chayqa manan kanchu.
Being alone is good.	Sapallan kayqa allinmi.
Yes, this is now a thing.	Arí, kayqa kunanmi imapas.
And these are not .	Hinaspa kaykunaqa manan .
No, that’s tomorrow afternoon.	Manan, chayqa paqarin tarde.
Everyone has an opinion.	Lliwmi huk yuyayniyuq kanku.
Black on the outside.	Hawapi yana.
That was twenty years ago.	Chayqa iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I didn’t want to give up coffee.	Manam kukata saqiyta munarqanichu.
Be faster, be first, important.	Aswan utqaylla kay, ñawpaq kay, importante.
In fact it is one of them.	Chiqaptaqa hukninmi.
We are usually very nice people.	Yaqa llapanpim ancha sumaq runakuna kanchik.
I haven’t been here in a long time.	Unayñan mana kaypichu kashani.
And here’s another one.	Hinaspa kaypi huk kaq.
But it doesn't matter if that's the case or not.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas mana kaptinpas manam imananpaschu.
That wasn’t certain.	Chayqa manan segurochu karqan.
He looked sad, proud and hurt.	Payqa llakisqa, orgulloso, k’irisqa ima qhawarisqa.
I knew what it would be like for you.	Ñoqaqa yacharqanim qampaq imayna kananta.
That could have been just you.	Chayqa qamllam kanman karqa.
We do not disagree here.	Kaypiqa manam mana acuerdopichu kayku.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
He seemed happy, she said.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa, nispas nin.
I really don’t know what to say!.	¡Chiqaptaqa mana yachanichu ima niyta!.
That is why he is depressed.	Chayraykum payqa llakisqa kachkan.
Being a bigger person.	Aswan hatun runa kay.
Now he knew he would.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
This statement is obviously wrong.	Kay nisqanqa sut’inmi pantasqa kashan.
I know this for a fact.	Kaytaqa chiqaptam yachani.
Today it is about three times larger.	Kunanqa yaqa kimsa kuti aswan hatunmi.
He was tired, after all.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan, tukuy imamanta.
I barely saw anything.	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikurqanichu.
There’s the reason why.	Chaypin kashan imarayku.
And happy to be who he is.	Hinaspa kusisqa pi kasqanmanta.
You are like a wise man.	Yachaysapa runa hinam kanki.
Hopefully, it will happen sooner.	Munaymanmi, aswan utqaylla chayna kananta.
This was quite a process.	Kayqa ancha ruwaymi karqa.
But he never said that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa nirqanchu.
He was such a fool.	Payqa chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
What was it that happened?.	¿Imataq karqa?.
I really wanted to go.	Anchatam riyta munarqani.
We do not disagree with this statement.	Kay nisqanqa manam mana acuerdopichu kayku.
How miserable you are!.	¡Imayna llakikuypaqmi kanki!.
Almost like he was never there.	Yaqa mana hayk’aqpas chaypi kaq hina.
A few months ago we did well.	Iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaqa allintam ruwarqayku.
Every so often, for sure.	Sapa kuti, seguro.
And maybe that’s not so bad in the end.	Hinaspa ichapas chayqa mana chayna mana allinchu kanman tukukuypi.
It’s such a good thing to do.	Chay hina allin ruwaymi.
But this thing.	Ichaqa kay imapas.
And all morning and night.	Hinaspa tukuy paqarin tuta.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allin runam.
He wanted it, now.	Payqa munarqa, kunanqa.
Maybe this makes sense.	Ichapas kayqa allin yuyayniyuq kanman.
It’s easy to get confused.	Facilmi pantasqa kayqa.
I’m sure this will happen.	Seguro kani kay pasananta.
But you can’t do it fast enough.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu chaytaqa ruwawaq.
It’s not bad, it’s just not very good, either.	Manam mana allinchu, chaylla mana ancha allinchu, nitaq.
It makes no sense, of course.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu, sut’inmi.
I’m glad if you’re safe and comfortable there.	Kusikuni sichus chaypi seguro hinaspa allin kanki chayqa.
But what if it was him.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman pay kaptinqa.
But that is not true.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa cheqaqchu.
It still is, it always will be.	Hinallam kachkan, sapa kutim kanqa.
And in doing so.	Hinaspa chayta ruwaspa.
I couldn’t sit with it.	Manam chaywanqa tiyayta atirqanichu.
You know very well.	Ancha allintam yachanki.
I'm fine with it.	Ñuqaqa allintam kachkani.
Second, it’s amazing.	Iskay kaq, admirakuypaqmi.
It’s easier but it’s the right thing to do.	Aswan facilmi ichaqa allin ruwaymi.
that wouldn’t be a good thing.	chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
So that was a big deal.	Chaymi chayqa hatun ruway karqan.
It’s me, after all.	Ñuqam kani, tukuy imamanta.
But they were not human.	Ichaqa manan runa hinachu karqanku.
He immediately knew what it was.	Payqa chayllam yacharqa ima kasqanmanta.
This means immediately.	Kayqa chayllam niyta munan.
Then there they are.	Chaymanta chaypi kachkanku.
So he came up with this.	Chaymi payqa kayta yuyaykurqan.
I think it would be wrong.	Yuyaykuni mana allinchu kanman.
What’s with me.	Imataq ñuqawan kachkan.
But I never heard of it.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa uyarirqanichu.
That man is a crazy man.	Chay runaqa loco runam.
Now I’m kind of waiting for someone.	Kunanqa huk laya pitapas suyachkani.
The injury.	Chay k'irisqa.
If so, it is very simple.	Sichus chay hina kanman chayqa, ancha facilmi.
No, it’s a lot.	Mana, achka.
Yes, it will be.	Arí kanqa.
It was really difficult.	Chiqamanta sasa karqa.
Crazy, man.	Loco, runa.
Certainly safer in most cases.	Chiqamanta aswan seguro aswan achka kutipi.
He could probably convince her.	Yaqapaschá convencechiyta atinman karqa.
First of all, it’s huge.	Ñawpaqtaqa hatunmi.
Not that big of a deal.	Mana chay hatun ruwaychu.
In fact, it’s worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi.
It was very lonely.	Ancha sapallanmi karqa.
I have always been.	Sapa kutim karqani.
In whatever he does well.	Imapas allin ruwasqanpi.
But we are here now.	Ichaqa kunanmi kaypi kachkaniku.
This guy, though.	Kay runam ichaqa.
And we’re busy.	Hinaspa ocupasqa kayku.
An injury or injury.	Huk k’irisqa utaq k’irisqa.
It’s the craziest thing.	Aswan loco kaqmi.
I wonder what happened to him.	Tapukuni imataq paywan pasarqa.
So he’ll be out there.	Chaymi payqa hawapi kanqa.
Everyone was very thoughtful.	Lliwmi ancha yuyayniyuq karqaku.
He does a pretty good job on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi allin allin llamkayta ruwan.
And this time for good.	Hinaspa kay kutipi allinpaq.
Maybe someone here.	Ichapas kaypi pipas.
He was never anyone else.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas huk runachu karqan.
I plan to go to the city.	Llaqtaman riyta yuyaykuni.
That’s what he put on.	Chayqa pay churasqa.
He didn’t want to be older.	Payqa manan kuraq kayta munarqanchu.
This seemed unpleasant.	Kayqa mana sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
You never really know where you are.	Manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu yachanki maypi kasqaykita.
He spoke highly of you.	Payqa anchatan qanmanta rimarqan.
Tell me everything you.	Tukuy imata willaway qam.
A regular practice.	Sapa kuti ruwanapaq ruway.
I already can't wait for next year.	Ñam hamuq wata suyayta atinichu.
If you don’t, you’re not.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, manan chay hinachu kanki.
No one is really bad and no one is really good.	Mana pipas chiqap mana allinchu nitaq pipas chiqap allinchu.
Tell me where I am in the world.	Kay pachapi maypi kasqayta willaway.
And now it will be.	Hinaspa kunanqa kanqa.
The easy half, and it wasn't that easy.	Chay facil kuskan, hinaspa mana chayna facilchu karqa.
So very very very bad.	Chaymi ancha ancha ancha mana allin.
I can’t be him.	Manam pay kayta atiymanchu.
The whole process.	Tukuy ruway.
In fact, everything is very simple.	Aswanpas tukuy imapas ancha facilmi.
I’m afraid it’s the latter though.	Manchakuni chay qhipa kaqta ichaqa.
Last night, it was tough.	Qayna tutam, sinchi sasa karqa.
I wonder what time it is.	Tapukuni ima hora kasqanmanta.
One day I was very sad.	Huk punchawmi anchata llakisqa tarikurqani.
I’m not good or bad.	Manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kani.
I almost can't handle this here.	Yaqa mana kaypi kayta hap'iyta atiymanchu.
It was all the time.	Tukuy tiempon karqan.
Things began to make sense.	Imapas allinta entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
It was rather surprising.	Aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He does a good job.	Payqa allintan ruwan.
It will be alone.	Sapallanmi kanqa.
I didn’t actually see him.	Manam chiqaptaqa paytaqa rikurqanichu.
Do this process once a month.	Kay ruwaytaqa killapi huk kutita ruway.
I know how sad you are.	Yachanim imayna llakisqa kasqaykita.
You can do all that next week.	Chayta tukuyta ruwawaq hamuq semanapi.
This was a big deal.	Kayqa hatun ruwaymi karqan.
This is not such a process.	Kayqa manam chayna ruwaychu.
I hear you’re married.	Uyarini casarasqa kasqaykita.
The first person on the moon.	Killapi ñawpaq kaq runa.
He's a little nervous.	Payqa huk chikan mancharisqa kachkan.
One sure thing.	Huk seguro kaq.
And that was the last time.	Hinaspa chaymi karqan qhepa kuti.
Not such a good thing to do.	Mana chayna allin ruwaychu.
He wanted to talk.	Payqa rimayta munarqa.
He wanted to go out like before.	Ñawpaq hina lluqsiyta munarqan.
Maybe it’s too big.	Ichapas sinchi hatun kanman.
That was very sad for him.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa paypaq.
Maybe I don’t like it.	Ichapas mana gustawanchu.
It doesn’t seem to be the case.	Manam chayna kanman hinachu.
If this is the case.	Sichus kay hina kanman chayqa.
Not going home.	Mana wasiman riy.
I never thought of it that way, actually.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa piensarqanichu, chiqaptaqa.
Alone in the world.	Kay pachapi sapallan.
He couldn't find anything for me.	Payqa manam imatapas ñuqapaq tariyta atirqachu.
But it wasn’t like it is now.	Ichaqa manan kunan hinachu karqan.
I can't wait to talk to him.	Manam suyayta atinichu paywan rimayta.
That's all there is to it.	Chayllam chaymantaqa kachkan.
I mean, there’s no reason to do that.	Niyta munani, mana imaraykupas kanchu chayta ruwanapaq.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Allintam yacharqa ima munasqanmanta.
It would be worse today.	Kunan tiempopiqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
It seemed safer.	Aswan seguro hinam karqa.
This was the man he was supposed to be.	Kaymi karqan chay runa kanan karqan.
Or what time it is.	Utaq ima hora.
You want to be important.	Munanki importante kayta.
He had no idea where he belonged.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi paypaq kasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it’s easy.	Mana chayqa, facilmi.
Don’t pretend you don’t know why.	Ama imarayku mana yachasqaykita hina ruwaychu.
He certainly refused.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanchu.
He's really worried.	Payqa chiqaptam llakisqa kachkan.
I don’t like being like this.	Manam gustawanchu kayna kayqa.
I feel like he’s really happy.	Chiqap kusisqa kasqanmantam sientekuni.
You can’t get anywhere fast enough.	Mana maymanpas utqaylla chayayta atiwaqchu.
One day I want to do that.	Huk punchawmi chayta ruwayta munani.

But nothing less certain.	Ichaqa manan imapas pisi segurochu.
I was the only child.	Ñuqallam wawa karqani.
It really is a big deal.	Chiqaptam hatun ruwaymi.
That can be a daunting task.	Chayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi kanman.
As in the present day.	Kunan tiempopi hina.
These people were probably not good enough.	Chay runakunaqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqanku.
I didn’t do anything like that.	Manam chaynataqa imatapas ruwarqanichu.
He would be very proud of me now.	Payqa kunanqa anchatam ñuqamanta orgulloso kanman.
This here I am.	Kay kaypi ñuqa kani.
We agree on that.	Chaymantaqa acuerdopi kayku.
After all, this is a great day.	Tukuy imamanta, kayqa hatun p’unchawmi.
And then tell me how it went.	Hinaspa chaymanta willaway imayna risqanmanta.
It was as good as new.	Musuq hina allinmi karqa.
That is why they are in prison now.	Chayraykum kunanqa carcelpi kachkanku.
He does this thing.	Payqa kaytan ruwan.
These people really want it.	Kay runakunaqa chiqaptam munanku.
And then he said it all.	Hinaspa chaymanta tukuyta nirqa.
But I think it should be him.	Ichaqa paymi kanan nispaymi yuyaykuni.
We did it once or twice.	Huk kuti iskay kutitam ruwarqayku.
And really, it doesn't matter.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa, manam imananpaschu.
I have such a good many ideas.	Chay hina allin achka yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I might have been, too.	Ñuqapas ichapas chayna karqani.
I was, like.	Ñuqaqa karqani, imayna.
I really didn’t mean that.	Chiqamanta mana chayta niyta munarqanichu.
I had an interesting talk today.	Kunan punchawmi huk sumaq rimayta ruwarqani.
That was like three.	Chayqa kimsa hinam karqa.
He wanted to be here.	Payqa kaypi kaytam munarqa.
It looks like this.	Kayman rikchakun.
I was there last night, actually.	Qayna tutam chaypi karqani, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe a little annoyed with me.	Ichapas ñuqawan huk chikan phiñasqa.
Of course, he didn’t need much convincing.	Arí, manan necesitarqanchu anchata convencechiyta.
We did very well here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwarqayku.
They want more and more.	Aswan achkatam munanku.
You will want to learn more later.	Qhepamanmi astawan yachayta munanki.
Do it again, again.	Yapamanta ruway, yapamanta.
Doing one was wrong.	Hukta ruwayqa mana allinchu karqa.
I didn’t know much about anything.	Manam imamantapas anchatachu yacharqani.
There’s something familiar about it.	Chaypiqa kanmi imapas riqsisqa.
Surely someone did.	Cheqaqtapunin pipas chayta ruwarqan.
That was obvious from his reaction.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan imayna ruwasqanmanta.
Tired, many times.	Sayk’usqa, achka kuti.
Have a nice day after all.	Sumaq punchaw tukuy imamanta.
But this is a bad thing.	Ichaqa kayqa mana allinmi.
I learn something about it.	Chaymantam imatapas yachani.
I want to walk again.	Hukmanta puriyta munani.
Not like any other.	Mana huk hinachu.
I know who the kid is.	Yachanim pichus chay wawa kasqanmanta.
But things aren’t always so simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas sapa kuti.
He hurried into his house.	Usqhayllan wasinman haykurqan.
Make it uncomfortable for him.	Paypaq mana allin kananpaq ruway.
The process performs the following steps.	Chay ruwayqa kay ruwaykunata ruwan.
I probably went the night before.	Yaqapaschá ñawpaq tuta rirqani.
But it happened yesterday.	Ichaqa qayna punchawmi pasarqa.
But you have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintan chaytaqa ruwanayki.
He wasn’t here.	Manam kaypichu karqa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Chaywanqa manam imapas kanchu.
That lasted about ten days.	Chayqa yaqa chunka punchawmi karqa.
I knew this was coming.	Kay hamunanta yacharqanim.
He could probably fall asleep sooner.	Payqa yaqapaschá usqhaylla puñuyta atinman karqan.
It was probably somewhere.	Yaqapaschá maypipas karqan.
Third chance.	Kimsa kaq chansa.
That’s the worst part.	Chaymi aswan mana allinqa.
Now it's not too bad.	Kunanqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
I don’t even want to see it.	Manam nitaq qawayta munanichu.
The patient may be unconscious.	Unqusqa mana yuyayniyuq kanman.
I've never done it but I want it just as bad.	Manam haykapipas ruwarqanichu ichaqa chayna mana allintam munani.
He seems very happy today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha kusisqa rikchakun.
It’s a great idea.	Hatun yuyayniyuqmi.
In a carriage.	Huk carropi.
I'd be here later.	Qhepamanmi kayman.
But these people are not like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kay runakunaqa.
Instead, tell me there.	Aswanpas chaypi willaway.
That’s the thing about here.	Chayqa kaymanta kaqmi.
I wasn’t yesterday.	Manam qayna punchawchu karqani.
However, my	Ichaqa, ñuqapa .
I’ve been around for a long time.	Unayñan kashani.
On the contrary, it is not.	Aswanpas manan chay hinachu.
Perhaps the latter failed.	Yaqapaschá chay qhepa kaq mana allintachu ruwarqan.
You can’t be someone else.	Manan huk runa kayta atiwaqchu.
Maybe the day before.	Ichapas ñawpaq punchaw.
Say you want money.	Qullqita munanki niy.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe never.	Ichapas paqarin, ichapas mana haykapipas.
He wanted to know all about it.	Payqa tukuy chaymanta yachayta munarqa.
This in no way means that there is a problem right now.	Kayqa manan imapipas niyta munanchu kunanpacha sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
And this is how it should be.	Hinaspa kayna kanan.
I didn’t do that there.	Manam chaypichu chaytaqa ruwarqani.
The man was outside.	Chay runaqa hawapi kasqa.
And, yes, he is the one.	Hinaspa, arí, paymi chay.
I can’t listen to that.	Chaytaqa manam uyariyta atiymanchu.
It was too easy.	Chayqa llumpay facilmi karqa.
Maybe half a day.	Ichapas kuskan punchaw.
But it was never going to work out.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanan karqan.
He wasn't ready to face it.	Payqa manan listochu kasharqan chayta atipananpaq.
Something he had always wanted to do.	Imapas ñawpaqmantaraqmi ruwayta munarqa.
And again last night.	Hinaspa yapamanta qayna tuta.
He was always out of me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqamanta lluqsirqa.
I had a great time last night.	Qayna tutam ancha kusisqa karqani.
I do it all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chaytaqa ruwani.
It was too big for that.	Chaypaqqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
I thought about it a bit.	Huk chhikanta yuyaykurqani.
I don’t want to see him.	Manam munanichu payta qawayta.
That was probably cold.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chiri karqa.
He’s a great, like, player.	Payqa hatun, hina, pukllaqmi.
This is the most important time.	Kaymi aswan importante tiempo.
That’s why everything happened so fast.	Chayraykum tukuy imapas chaylla pasarqa.
Maybe it’s an easy one.	Ichapas huk facil kaq kanman.
I think he was scared.	Yuyaykuni mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
But he did better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan ruwarqan.
This was a big one, still.	Kayqa hatunmi karqa, kunankamapas.
Everything was wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He told me to do that.	Chaynata ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
This was me in the world.	Kaymi karqani kay pachapi.
In fact, he said it.	Aswanpas chaytan nirqan.
No real problem there.	Mana chiqap sasachakuy chaypiqa.
I’ll be the last one.	Qhipa kaqmi kasaq.
You know in the past.	Ñawpaqpi yachanki.
I mean hungry for success.	Allin kananpaq yarqaymanta niyta munani.
In fact, it wasn’t.	Aswanpas manan chay hinachu karqan.
I mean really hungry.	Chiqamanta yarqaymanta niyta munani.
You want to buy time.	Tiempota rantiyta munanki.
I want to understand.	Entiendeyta munani.
That was the hard part.	Chayqa sinchi sasa kaqmi karqa.
He was really hungry.	Cheqaqtapunin yarqaymanta kasharqan.
I think this is pretty big.	Kayqa ancha hatun kasqanmantam piensani.
That wasn’t the best.	Chayqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
If, of course, he can.	Sichus, sut’inmi, atinman chayqa.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manan facilchu.
He certainly appreciated that.	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin allinpaq qhawarirqan.
That is one of his successes.	Chayqa allin ruwasqanmanta hukninmi.
I don’t think anywhere near right.	Manam maypipas allintachu piensani.
No one knows where it will go.	Mayman rinqa chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
Great, great, trouble.	Hatun, hatun, sasachakuy.
Everything is secondary, he thinks.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaqmi, nispan yuyaykun.
I'm really busy.	Chiqaptam ocupasqa kachkani.
Not for very long.	Mana ancha unaytachu.
He seemed happy tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
He was the	Paymi karqan .
I don’t feel safe at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu tarikuni.
What a process though.	Ima ruwaymi ichaqa.
I’ve been here a long time.	Unayñam kaypi kachkani.
Now he is afraid of it.	Kunanqa manchakunmi chayta.
I couldn’t eat them.	Manam chaykunataqa mikuyta atirqanichu.
That has always been acceptable.	Chayqa tukuy tiempon allinpaq qhawarisqa.
He doesn’t sound confused at all.	Payqa manan imapipas pantasqa hinachu uyarikun.
It’s not anywhere anywhere.	Manam maypipas maypipas kanchu.
He repeated this several times.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan hukmanta rimarqan.
What a night that was.	Ima tutam chay tutaqa karqa.
I know something is wrong.	Yachanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Like, really easy.	Imayna, chiqap facil.
No, there is nothing.	Manan, manan imapas kanchu.
This complicated things.	Chaywanmi imapas sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
Then he is the first.	Chaymantaqa paymi ñawpaq kaq.
But he is alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kachkan.
Here’s how you find out.	Kaypi imaynatam yachanki.
I don’t really get it.	Manam chiqaptachu hapini.
Great, great man.	Hatun, hatun runa.
So it would be from here.	Chaymi kaymanta pacha kanman.
I don’t want to dwell on that here.	Manam kaypichu chaypi yuyaymanayta munani.
There he learned the language.	Chaypim chay simita yacharqa.
I thought this was kind of ugly.	Kayqa huk laya millay kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
Would it be that bad?.	¿Chayna mana allinchu kanman?.
It was a whole process.	Chayqa huk tukuy ruwaymi karqan.
The house needs repairs.	Wasi allichayta necesitan.
Then you really have to do something about it.	Chaymantaqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwanayki.
I had no idea, man.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani, runa.
This is not good, either.	Kayqa manam allinchu, nitaq.
This is what the man said.	Kaymi chay runaqa nisqa.
He was here, but he was gone.	Payqa kaypim karqa, ichaqa manañam karqachu.
Say that you are.	Qam kasqaykita niy.
So far, I'm fine.	Kunankamaqa allinmi kachkani.
I feel frustrated every day.	Sapa punchawmi hukmanyasqa tarikuni.
This was what it was all about.	Kaymi karqan tukuy imamanta.
They weren’t very good.	Paykunaqa manan ancha allinchu karqanku.
It was a really great night for me.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq tuta karqa ñuqapaq.
He knew ahead of time what was best for him.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqa imakuna paypaq allin kasqanmanta.
That's the safest thing.	Chayqa aswan seguro kaqmi.
He’s cold, you’re cold.	Payqa chiri, qamqa chiri.
He was his own man.	Payqa kikin runan karqan.
So this is it.	Chaymi kay.
I won’t have to do it.	Manam ruwanay kanqachu.
Anyway, one day he was gone.	Imayna kaptinpas, huk punchawmi manaña karqachu.
About a year later.	Yaqa huk wata qhepamanmi.
He was one anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas hukninmi karqa.
It doesn’t look like much.	Manam anchatachu rikchakun.
Tell us what we need to do.	Willay imata ruwanayku kasqanmanta.
Now I know why.	Kunanqa yachanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Everything will be as it should be.	Tukuy imapas kanan hinam kanqa.
The lower the better.	Aswan pisi kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
I didn’t know how to fix it.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna allichayta.
Perhaps he has lost his mind.	Ichapas manaña yuyayniyuqchu.
Said something to someone a while ago.	Imatapas huk rato pimanpas nisqa.
It makes the game more realistic.	Pukllayta aswan chiqap kaqta ruwan.
No, it would be nice.	Manan, allinmi kanman.
I'm still waiting.	Hinallam suyachkani.
He has been like that for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chhayna kashan.
He had no real idea what to do first.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yuyaykurqan imatachus ñawpaqta ruwananta.
So, it cost me so much.	Chayna, ancha achkatam qullqita quwarqa.
Success was essential to success.	Allin ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa allin ruway kananpaq.
That was the reality.	Chayqa cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
They want something from me.	Paykunaqa ñuqamanta imatapas munanku.
So he was very scared.	Chaymi ancha mancharisqa.
Probably later.	Yaqapaschá qhepaman.
I never really wanted to.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni munarqanichu.
I almost didn't realize it.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa repararqanichu.
Make him leave.	Ripunanpaq ruway.
Lonely, sure, but good.	Sapallan, seguro, ichaqa allinmi.
He wanted to be admired.	Payqa admirasqa kaytan munarqan.
He wasn't sure he could do it again.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan hukmanta chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Otherwise, it looks amazing!.	Mana chayqa, ¡admirakuypaqmi rikchakun!.
He thought he could make good on that.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chaymanta allinta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He couldn't remember why.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu imarayku chayta.
But he wants nothing to do with me.	Ichaqa manan munanchu ñoqawan ima ruwaytapas.
Beautiful stuff really, beautiful.	Sumaq imapas chiqap, sumaq.
She was glad he was gone.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa manaña kasqanmanta.
At least it’s good.	Aswanpas allinmi.
One should not do that.	Huk runaqa manan chaytaqa ruwananchu.
He's never done that.	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Can’t wait to make another one.	Mana suyayta atinchu hukta ruwayta.
You learn better in the city.	Llaqtapiqa aswan allinta yachanki.
But it was a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi karqa.
It will be a very difficult time.	Ancha sasa tiempon kanqa.
That must be him.	Chayqa paymi kanan.
Nothing is that bad.	Manam imapas chayna mana allinchu.
You were here before.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypi karqanki.
No one said you were ugly.	Manan pipas nirqanchu millay kasqaykita.
He did this, no, he did that.	Payqa kaytan ruwarqan, manan, chaytan ruwarqan.
They want to know.	Paykunaqa yachayta munanku.
But he was alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kasqa.
But he hasn’t thought about it yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chaypichu yuyaykushan.
He didn’t want her to know.	Payqa manan munarqanchu yachananta.
How do you want to fix it.	Imaynatataq allichayta munanki.
I intend to fix that.	Chayta allichayta yuyaykuni.
No, he didn’t know where they were.	Manan, manan yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
He's already talking to her.	Payqa ñam paywan rimachkan.
I really, really want to go.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta riyta munani.
A beautiful man.	Huk sumaq runa.
He wanted some time alone.	Payqa sapallanmi huk tiempota munarqan.
And how beautiful it is.	Hinaspa imayna sumaqmi.
So he wasn’t sure what to do.	Chaymi payqa mana ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
He is a wonderful man, always has been.	Payqa sumaq runam, sapa kutim karqa.
You’ll think about it.	Chaypin yuyaykunki.
Where is the problem.	Maypitaq chay sasachakuy kachkan.
However, this doesn’t have to be a big deal, either.	Ichaqa, kayqa manan hatun ruwaychu kanan, nitaq.
He thought he was trapped.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi hap’isqa kashasqanmanta.
This isn’t always as easy as it sounds, however.	Kayqa manan sapa kutichu uyarikun hina facilchu, ichaqa.
That's what I do now.	Kunanqa chaynatam ruwani.
The process is completely confidential.	Chay ruwayqa tukuy imamanta pakasqa kachkan.
I can’t leave you here.	Manam kaypi saqiyta atiymanchu.
There were two people.	Iskay runakunam karqa.
This makes most of the sense.	Kayqa yaqa llapan yuyayniyuqmi.
I'm waiting for the answer.	Suyachkani kutichiyta.
The process went poorly.	Chay ruwayqa mana allintachu rirqa.
It’s there, I mean it’s good.	Chaypin kashan, allinmi niyta munani.
He is not a good good guy.	Payqa manam allin allin runachu.
He was wrong about that.	Chaywanmi pantasqa karqa.
He couldn’t resist it.	Payqa manan chayta hark’ayta atirqanchu.
What was the wrong thing? 	¿Imataq mana allinchu karqa?
That will probably be will be true.	Chayqa ichapas kanqa chiqap kanqa.
Do this as follows.	Kay hinata ruway.
I don’t know much about anything anymore.	Manañam imamantapas anchatachu yachani.
But you always do, always.	Ichaqa sapa kutim ruwanki, sapa kuti.
Maybe drunk or sick or something.	Ichapas machasqa utaq unqusqa utaq imapas.
Like the other villain.	Huknin millay runa hina.
He has no reason not to.	Payqa manan imaraykupas kanchu mana chayta ruwananpaqqa.
Everyone here was honest.	Kaypiqa llapallankum chiqap rimaq karqaku.
That man never existed.	Chay runaqa manan hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
But yes, that is not the case.	Ichaqa arí, chayqa manan hinachu.
No, it’s tomorrow.	Manan, paqarin p’unchay.
Couldn’t afford coffee.	Mana kukata rantiyta atirqachu.
I’m here all the time.	Tukuy tiempon kaypi kashani.
And man, man.	Hinaspa runa, runa.
You have no idea how good that is .	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanki imayna allin chayna .
We are never really ready.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni listochu kanchik.
I like that person.	Chay runam gustan.
He looked unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu qhawarisqa.
Bigger now.	Aswan hatun kunan.
He's not really sure yet.	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa segurochu kachkan.
He couldn’t finish it.	Manas tukuyta atirqachu.
That he needed her.	Payta necesitasqanmanta.
I can’t talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu.
Eat regularly.	Sapa kutilla mikhuy.
I really, really want to catch him.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta payta hap’iyta munani.
Then, go there.	Chaymanta, chayman riy.
The ultimate summer season.	Chay qhipa kaq verano pacha.
He was, himself, the kid.	Payqa, pay kikin, chay wawa karqa.
They were all on bikes.	Llapallankum bicicletapi karqaku.
Nothing seemed real.	Manam imapas chiqap hinachu karqa.
I said the right thing.	nispaymi allinta nirqani.
Tell him what he will do next.	Chay qhepaman imata ruwananta willay.
I wonder why this was hidden there.	Tapukuni imaraykutaq kayqa chaypi pakasqa karqa.
He can’t have it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa hap’iyta atinmanchu.
That’s your best bet.	Chayqa qampa aswan allin kaqmi.
I feel very angry.	Sinchi phiñasqa sientekuni.
That’s all I know.	Chayllam yachani.
But someone, somewhere, knows.	Ichaqa pipas, maypipas, yachanmi.
Tonight was his, finally.	Kunan tutaqa paypaq karqan, tukukuypi.
But he wasn't sure about that.	Ichaqa manan chaymanta segurochu karqan.
So, that was amazing.	Chaymi, chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Don’t be less intelligent.	Ama pisi yuyayniyuq kaychu.
You mean something silly.	Mana yuyayniyuq ima niyta munanki.
He could hear nothing of what had happened.	Chay pasasqanmantaqa manam imatapas uyariyta atirqachu.
He felt uncomfortable.	Payqa mana allinchu hinam tarikurqa.
That that is not true.	Chayqa mana cheqaqchu kasqanmanta.
For him, for him.	Paypaq, paypaq.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa mana allinchu.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqan.
I know that, for sure.	Chaytaqa yachanin, seguro.
One day someone told me.	Huk punchawmi huk runa niwarqa.
He doesn’t do much.	Payqa manan anchatachu ruwan.
The good, the bad and the really ugly.	Allin kaq, mana allin kaq hinaspa chiqap millay kaq.
He cannot reach that point.	Chaymanqa manam chayayta atinmanchu.
It was better then.	Chay tiempopiqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I don’t know if he can play evil.	Mana yachanichu millay pukllayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
Now everything was very clear.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas ancha sut’inmi karqan.
One two, one two	Huk iskay, huk iskay .
It’s better that way.	Chayna aswan allinmi.
Maybe this is all good.	Ichapas kay tukuy imapas allin kanman.
I feel safer.	Aswan seguro sientekuni.
They are not human.	Paykunaqa manan runa hinachu kanku.
It was this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi karqa.
Both are wrong.	Iskayninkum pantasqa kanku.
I’m the one out there.	Ñuqaqa kani chay hawapi kaq.
I know this is not true.	Yachanim kayqa mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
But it won’t be that difficult.	Ichaqa manan chay hina sasachu kanqa.
I don’t know anywhere well.	Manam maypipas allintachu yachani.
He had to be there, somewhere.	Payqa chaypi kanan karqan, maypipas.
Why, there is nothing there! 	¡Imanasqataq, chaypiqa manam imapas kanchu!
Lots of ridiculous success.	Achka asikunapaq allin ruway.
He couldn't take this anymore.	Manañam kayta hapiyta atirqachu.
I went to high school there.	Chaypim hatun yachay wasiman rirqani.
I'm not that good at it.	Ñuqaqa manam chayna allinchu kani chaypiqa.
He was with me.	Payqa ñoqawanmi kasharqan.
Each object knows what type it is.	Sapa imapas yachan ima laya kasqanmanta.
They were always here on weekends.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim kaypi karqaku semana tukuyta.
It’s just, really .	Chaylla, chiqap .
He doesn’t want to see her again.	Payqa manañan hukmanta rikuyta munanchu.
He still seemed to.	Payqa hinallam rikchakurqa.
This didn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
Or anyone else.	Utaq pitapas.
You just did something.	Chayllaraqmi imatapas ruwarqanki.
There is no point in trying to sleep.	Puñuyta munaspaqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I have two thoughts about that.	Chaymantaqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi kani.
So that one came out.	Chaymi chay huk lluqsirqa.
The process will be.	Chay ruwayqa kanqa.
That would make a lot more sense.	Chayqa aswan achka yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
I hope they are right.	Suyachkani allin kasqankuta.
I hope all is well.	Tukuy imapas allin kananta suyachkani.
He realized he wasn't expecting this.	Payqa repararqanmi kayta mana suyasqanmanta.
In fact, it would be very useful.	Aswanpas ancha allinmi kanman.
That means there is something there.	Chayqa chaypi imapas kasqanmantam niyta munan.
I wanted to do it.	Ñuqaqa ruwayta munarqani.
Now he wanted her to.	Kunanqa munarqanmi chayta ruwananta.
Maybe it’s worse.	Ichapas aswan millay kanman.
The result was a beautiful one.	Chay ruwasqanqa sumaqmi karqa.
I want to fix this.	Kayta allichayta munani.
But that was better.	Ichaqa chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
But no one could do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
We are adults.	Kuraq runakunam kanchik.
This doesn't sound right.	Kayqa manam allinchu uyarikun.
The first was the night before.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan ñawpaq tuta.
That’s the future.	Chayqa hamuq pacha.
I can go, if I want to.	Riyta atiyman, munaspaqa.
He must do the right thing.	Chaypaqqa allintam ruwanan.
A lot of knowledge.	Achka yachay.
No coffee for me.	Mana kukata ñuqapaq.
I’ve heard this before.	Kaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi uyarirqani.
But they are not easy at all.	Ichaqa manan imapipas facilchu kanku.
They are very nice to us.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqaykuwan.
That would have been me.	Chayqa ñuqam kanman karqa.
It was a bit intense.	Huk chhikantan sinchi karqan.
Wouldn’t that be difficult.	Manachu chay sasa kanman.
I think it’s black.	Yuyaykuni yana kasqanmanta.
But it doesn’t mean anything now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imatapas niyta munanchu.
Can’t remember things.	Mana imakunatapas yuyariyta atinchu.
Alright .	Allinmi .
But what a man.	Ichaqa ima runa.
So you better get it right.	Chaymi aswan allin kanman allinta ruwanaykipaq.
I hear it almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi uyarini.
I don't know when that will happen yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu haykapi chay kananta.
It was great to be with us.	Ancha allinmi karqa ñuqaykuwan kayqa.
I don't believe he ever will.	Manam creenichu haykapipas ruwananta.
This is first and foremost.	Kayqa ñawpaqtaqa ñawpaqpi kachkan.
I didn’t really know how or why.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imaynata nitaq imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
They weren’t like everyone else.	Paykunaqa manan llapa runakuna hinachu karqanku.
I know when to go.	Yachanim haykapi rinaypaq.
This was a man who did things.	Kayqa imatapas ruwaq runam karqa.
What we have done in the past.	Ñawpaqpi ima ruwasqaykumanta.
He would never, ever do this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas kayta ruwanmanchu karqan.
That’s what it is? 	Chayqa, ¿imataq?
For now, it remains a mystery.	Kunankamaqa pakasqa hinam kachkan.
I can’t leave him.	Paytaqa manam saqiyta atiymanchu.
They were not happy about it.	Chaywanmi mana kusisqachu karqaku.
No idea about me.	Mana yuyayniyuq ñuqamanta.
He was always very serious.	Payqa sapa kutim ancha serio karqa.
Another player, perhaps.	Huk pukllaq, ichapas.
It says a lot.	Anchatam nin.
But he probably has no choice.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
I think he did the whole story.	Yuyaykuni paymi tukuy willakuyta ruwarqan.
Repeat that, again and again.	Chayta yapamanta ruway, yapamanta yapamanta.
Maybe this can wait.	Ichapas kayqa suyayta atinman.
I don’t really know what it is yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yachani ima kasqanmanta.
Please do better here.	Ama hina kaspa kaypi aswan allinta ruway.
This is my why.	Kaymi ñuqapa imarayku.
It was originally posted here.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypi churasqa karqan.
The guy first.	Chay wayna ñawpaqta.
I feel like a bit more of an adult now.	Kunanqa huk chikan aswan hatun runa hinam tarikuni.
We agree with that.	Chaywanmi acuerdopi kayku.
Why didn’t you say that.	¿Imanasqataq mana chaynatachu nirqanki.
Both are very large.	Iskayninku ancha hatun.
This is the easiest way to do it.	Kaymi aswan facil ruwayqa.
He knows how she feels.	Payqa yachanmi imayna sientekusqanmanta.
People are amazing.	Runakunaqa admirakuypaqmi.
nope.	manam.
He probably didn’t think so.	Manapaschá chaytachu yuyaykurqan.
We are here to make that happen.	Chayna kananpaqmi kaypi kachkaniku.
Without overdoing it.	Mana llumpayta ruwaspa.
And then along with it.	Hinaspa chaymanta kuska chaywan kuska.
But he was always right.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi allinta rimaq.
But he knew it had to be true.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kananta.
But I wasn’t as vulnerable as others.	Ichaqa manan wakin hinachu sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
I know he was very upset.	Yachanim ancha llakisqa kasqanmanta.
Please let me know if this is correct.	Ama hina kaspa, kay allin kaptinqa willaway.
It’s not someone else, it’s just you.	Manam huk runachu, qamllam.
Less than a decade later.	Manaraq chunka wata qhepamanmi.
He couldn’t say or do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta nitaq ruwayta atirqanchu.
He didn’t do this.	Kaytaqa manan ruwarqanchu.
Maybe it would have been good.	Ichapas allin kanman karqa.
He didn’t say don’t do it.	Payqa manan nirqanchu ama ruwanaykipaq.
Maybe that will be better.	Ichapas chayqa aswan allin kanqa.
That everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta.
In fact, this is the first.	Aswanpas kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
He happily agreed.	Payqa kusisqa arí nisqa.
He knew what kind of person he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna runa kasqanmanta.
It looks very confusing.	Ancha pantasqa rikchakun.
And he does that job very well.	Hinaspa chay llamkayta ancha allinta ruwan.
He told me it wasn't right.	Paymi niwarqa mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
Do something positive with it.	Chaywan imapas allin kaqta ruway.
He wanted to know about her.	Payqa paymanta yachayta munarqa.
But he knows how to play.	Ichaqa yachan pukllayta.
The people here are wonderful.	Kaypi runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi.
I barely saw him again.	Yaqapaschá manaña paytaqa rikurqanichu.
She says thank you.	Payqa gracias nispas nin.
As if he meant well.	Allinta niyta munanman hina.
It came out very well.	Ancha allinta lluqsirqa.
I can’t think about it.	Manam chaymantaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
Something could be great.	Imapas hatunmi kanman.
Do whatever works for you.	Imapas qampaq allin kaqta ruway.
I’m afraid that’s the case.	Manchakuni chayna kasqanmanta.
But I don’t like it.	Ichaqa manan gustawanchu.
Not much of anything else.	Mana ancha imamantapas.
I have no idea how this happened.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kay pasasqanmanta.
It looked the same as before.	Ñawpaq hina kaqmi rikchakurqa.
I can do all of that here.	Tukuy chaykunataqa kaypi ruwayman.
He really meant it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta niyta munarqan.
I'm always afraid, for no reason.	Sapa kutim manchakuni, mana imaraykupas.
He’s good with me.	Payqa allinmi ñuqawan.
I know how good it is.	Yachanim imayna allin kasqanmanta.
I just couldn't imagine what it was like.	Chayllam mana yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
This is a really big deal.	Kayqa chiqamanta hatun ruwaymi.
It wasn’t the only thing he did.	Manam chayllachu chaytaqa ruwarqa.
Happy doing, everyone!.	¡Kusisqa ruway, llapa runa!.
So he was, but he wasn’t happy.	Chaymi payqa karqan, ichaqa manan kusisqachu kasharqan.
It’s always you, you, you.	Sapa kutim qam, qam, qam.
He was glad he liked it.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan gustasqanmanta.
That wouldn’t have been a big deal.	Chayqa mana hatun ruwaychu kanman karqan.
Maybe it works, but then again maybe not.	Ichapas allin kanman, ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta manapaschá.
Not a big deal, he said.	Mana hatun ruwaychu, nispa.
Nobody likes those things.	Chaykunataqa manam pipas gustanchu.
This is the process.	Kay ruwayqa.
This should be the latter.	Kayqa qhipa kaqmi kanan.
Yes, there is a reason.	Arí, kanmi imaraykupas.
But today was even funnier.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi aswan asikunapaq hina karqa.
They are really bad guys.	Paykunaqa chiqap millay runakunam.
A better idea is here.	Huk aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi kaypi kachkan.
But that is why he is in serious trouble.	Ichaqa chayraykum sinchi sasachakuypi tarikun.
The reason is obvious.	Imarayku chay ruwasqanqa sut’inmi.
He could never sit still.	Manam haykapipas tiyayta atirqachu.
This was not easy at all.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa ni imapipas.
So much to say here.	Ancha achkata kaypi niyta.
But he is a good man.	Ichaqa allin runam.
This means that if.	Kayqa niyta munan sichus.
I am as impressed as you are.	Ñoqapas qan hinan admirasqa kashani.
And, you’ll have fun doing it.	Hinaspa, chayta ruwaspa kusisqa kanki.
I wonder where he is.	Maypi kasqanmanta tapukuni.
But the truth is, it may not.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
Very good, that's all.	Ancha allinmi, chayllam.
Please don't	Ama hina kaspa, ama .
And that’s it.	Hinaspa chayta.
But then they were great.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa ancha allinmi karqanku.
No one paid much attention to him.	Manan pipas paytaqa anchatachu qhawarirqan.
Today was not a good day.	Kunan punchawqa manam allin punchawchu karqa.
They were devastated.	Paykunaqa sinchi llakisqa karqanku.
He was very, very angry.	Payqa ancha, ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
But nothing that .	Ichaqa manan imapas chay .
But that was the only good thing.	Ichaqa chayllam allin karqa.
What do you want to be?.	¿Imataq kayta munanki?.
I like all that stuff quite a bit.	Tukuy chay imapas allintam gustan.
I didn’t always succeed.	Manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwarqani.
I didn’t want to work here.	Manam kaypi llamkayta munarqanichu.
Everyone is hungry, everyone eats.	Lliwmi yarqaymanta, llapallanku mikun.
In fact, he’d be very, very good at it.	Chiqamanta, payqa ancha, ancha allin kanman chaypi.
It just stopped doing it.	Chayllam manaña ruwaychu karqa.
I think you can.	Yuyaykuni atisqaykita.
Or thought he knew.	Utaq yachasqanmanta yuyaykurqan.
He couldn’t bear to think about doing anything else.	Payqa manan aguantayta atirqanchu huk ruwaypi yuyaymanayta.
If he’s there, great, good for him.	Sichus chaypi kashan chayqa, hatun, allin paypaq.
He wanted to ask her a lot.	Anchatam tapuyta munarqa.
It was a real beauty.	Chiqap sumaq kaymi karqa.
It’s nice to talk about everything.	Tukuy imamanta rimayqa sumaqmi.
He knew what people were like.	Payqa yacharqanmi runakuna imayna kasqankuta.
Who are you?.	Pitaq kanki?.
Who did this.	Pitaq kayta ruwarqa.
He was happier there.	Chaypiqa aswan kusisqam karqa.
He will be a long time coming.	Payqa unayñan hamunqa.
But he goes anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas rin.
He couldn’t say it.	Manam niyta atirqachu.
I didn’t know this yet.	Kaytaqa manaraqmi yacharqanichu.
The second child.	Iskay kaq wawa.
Much, worse, in fact.	Ancha, aswan mana allin, chiqaptaqa.
He realized it was coming too soon.	Payqa repararqanmi nishuta usqhaylla hamunanta.
He still couldn't win.	Hinallam mana atipayta atirqachu.
This can do a number of things.	Kayqa achka ruwaykunata ruwanman.
Maybe he did it there.	Ichapas chaypi ruwarqa.
He is feeling guilty and sad.	Payqa huchayoq, llakisqa ima kashan.
This should be fine.	Kayqa allintam kanan.
All that’s good.	Tukuy chay allin.
That’s my thing.	Chayqa ñuqapa kaqmi.
He was like a man like me.	Payqa ñuqa hina runa hinam karqa.
Great to be there.	Hatun chaypi kayqa.
Everything happened before.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
They’re really, really good.	Paykunaqa chiqap, chiqap allinmi kanku.
The next one.	Qatiqnin.
He was there every few weeks.	Payqa sapa iskay kinsa semanan chaypi kaq.
But you were there too.	Ichaqa qampas chaypim karqanki.
I don’t want to be that kind of person.	Manam munanichu chayna runa kaytaqa.
I wish you could talk to me.	Munaymanmi ñoqawan rimayta atisqaykita.
I wanted to be a child.	Wawa kaytam munarqani.
He is the man of yesterday, the first.	Payqa qayna punchaw runam, ñawpaq kaqmi.
Unless he does something wrong.	Manachus pay mana allinta ruwaptinqa.
About two years.	Yaqa iskay wata.
You are a good teacher.	Allin yachachiqmi kanki.
It can’t be anyone else.	Manam huk runachu kanman.
I mean, thank you .	Niyta munani, gracias .
If that all sounds a bit ridiculous, it is.	Sichus chay llapan huk chhikanta asikunapaq hina uyarikun chayqa, chay hinan.
He couldn’t have done otherwise.	Payqa manan hukta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
That is a very difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi.
The same person as before.	Ñawpaq hina kaq runa.
Now it will come ten years later.	Kunanqa chunka wata qhepamanmi hamunqa.
Or a young man.	Utaq huk wayna.
It was an awkward moment.	Huk mana allin rato karqan.
I’m waiting for you, too.	Ñuqapas suyachkani.
This really speeds things up a lot.	Kayqa chiqaptam imakunatapas ancha utqaylla ruwan.
I was kind of the same.	Ñuqapas huk laya karqani.
No one noticed what they were.	Manan pipas repararqanchu imachus kasqankuta.
You think you know everything.	Tukuy imata yachasqaykita yuyanki.
But this was still the case.	Ichaqa kayqa hinallam karqa.
It seems to be more mysterious.	Aswan pakasqa hinam kachkan.
I knew he knew her name.	Yacharqanim sutinta yachasqanmanta.
He is neither good nor bad.	Payqa manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
So that’s pretty easy to do.	Chaymi chay ruwayqa ancha facil.
I said firmly.	nispaymi sinchita nirqani.
I did everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwarqani.
So he started walking.	Chaymi payqa puriyta qallaykurqa.
That’s a very sick girl there.	Chayqa chaypi ancha unqusqa sipasmi.
I don’t know him now.	Manam kunanqa riqsinichu.
He just went for a walk, you know.	Chaylla puriq rirqa, yachanki.
This would not be too difficult.	Kayqa manam ancha sasachu kanman.
That was rather ridiculous.	Chayqa aswan asikunapaq hinam karqa.
And then he did what he didn't do much.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana ancha ruwasqanta ruwarqa.
That’s a big deal!.	¡Chayqa hatun ruwaymi!.
Maybe that would be interesting.	Ichapas chayqa sumaq kanman.
That was a few years ago.	Chayqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
We’re just that.	Chaylla kanchik.
Everyone had a purpose.	Lliwmi imapaqpas karqaku.
That is not the case.	Chay ruwayqa manan chay hinachu.
I thought that was fine.	Chaytaqa allinmi nirqani.
I know it can work.	Yachanim llamkayta atisqanmanta.
Being here now.	Kaypi kunan kaspa.
Almost ten years passed.	Yaqa chunka watañam pasarqa.
I mean, well.	Niyta munani, allinta.
And isn’t it funny.	Hinaspa manachu asikunapaq hina.
It should have been that easy.	Chayna facilmi kanan karqa.
He wasn’t a good guy.	Payqa manam allin runachu karqa.
I don’t remember being young.	Manam yuyarinichu wayna kasqaymanta.
You are still doing it.	Qamqa hinallam ruwachkanki.
You mean a lot to me, you know.	Qamqa anchatam ñuqapaq niyta munanki, yachanki.
He knew he couldn’t take it alone.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana sapallan chayta hap’iyta atisqanmanta.
I just don’t get to do that.	Manapaschá chayta ruwanaypaqqa tarinichu.
That’s not really .	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu .
But you’re not like this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu kanki.
But a great house.	Ichaqa huk hatun wasi.
Everything that was there.	Tukuy imapas chaypi kaq.
There is this	Chaypin kay .
You're tired of it.	Sayk'usqañan kashanki.

But so far it has not worked.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manam allinchu karqa.
Everyone seems happy.	Tukuy kusisqa hinam kachkan.
But I couldn’t leave.	Ichaqa manan ripuyta atirqanichu.
That was very sad for me.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa ñuqapaq.
I certainly didn’t want that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chaytachu munarqani.
You never knew where anyone was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu maypi pipas kasqanmantaqa.
Is it stupidity? 	¿Sonso kaychu?
I’m sorry for being human.	Runa kasqaymanta llakikuni.
That’s a world.	Chayqa huk pacha.
You want that money.	Chay qullqita munanki.
He is the day at home.	Wasipi p'unchawmi paymi.
Better than nothing though.	Aswan allin mana imamanta ichaqa.
He can’t figure out what it is.	Payqa manan yuyaymanayta atinchu ima kasqanmanta.
Older, yes, maybe sadder.	Kuraq, arí, ichapas aswan llakisqa.
So far it’s pretty interesting.	Kunankamaqa ancha sumaqmi.
It was a wonderful night.	Chay tutaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Do the simplest thing first thing in the morning.	Aswan sasa kaqta ruway ñawpaqta tutamanta.
People have been comfortable with it for a long time.	Unayñan runakunaqa chaywanqa allinta kashanku.
I’m a child.	Ñuqam wawa kani.
Everything is in the present.	Lliwmi kunan tiempopi kachkan.

I’m not unhappy.	Manam mana kusisqachu kani.
But please do that.	Ichaqa ama hina kaspa chayta ruway.
Try something new every month.	Sapa killa imapas musuq kaqta ruway.
I think he might not agree with you.	Yuyaykuni manapaschá qanwan acuerdopichu kanman.
Instead, he did just that.	Aswanpas chaytan ruwarqan.
That’s a real person.	Chayqa chiqap runam.
It is quite cold there.	Chaypiqa allintam chiri kachkan.
But, then something good happened.	Ichaqa, chaymantam imapas allin pasarqa.
There is no insurance.	Manam seguro kanchu.
It’s funny to me.	Asikunapaq hina ñuqapaq.
He did this every morning.	Chaytaqa sapa paqarinmi ruwaq.
He knew they were in big trouble.	Payqa yacharqanmi hatun sasachakuypi kasqankuta.
That night a different moon.	Chay tuta huk chikan killa.
To make one of them.	Huknin ruwananpaq.

He’s not always there.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaypi kashan.
Not the tenth.	Mana chunka kaq.
Not there though.	Mana chaypichu ichaqa.
That it is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
But he didn’t want to see the truth.	Ichaqa manan cheqaq kaqta rikuyta munarqanchu.
Often they are in the world.	Sapa kutim paykunaqa kay pachapi kachkanku.
They want someone to make everything better.	Paykunaqa munanku pipas tukuy imata aswan allinta ruwananta.
I can’t really swim.	Manam chiqaptaqa nadayta atiymanchu.
And make it ready.	Hinaspa listo ruway.
I wonder how it is.	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni.
It could be very useful in the future.	Hamuq tiempopiqa ancha allinmi kanman.
All of this is rather interesting.	Tukuy kaykunaqa aswan sumaqmi.
I never want to be again.	Manañam haykapipas kayta munanichu.
I didn’t want to tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta munarqanichu.
It means everything.	Tukuy ima niyta munan.
Such a clever, successful act.	Chayna yachaysapa, allin ruway.
He is truly alone.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sapallan kashan.
You can’t walk away.	Manam puriyta atiwaqchu.
Easy to say, hard to do.	Facil niyta, sasa ruway.
He does well with it.	Chaywanmi allinta ruwan.
Seriously, he said.	Serio nisqa.
He wasn’t like me, not at all.	Payqa manan ñoqa hinachu karqan, manan imapipas.
That’s what I thought.	Chaytan ñoqaqa yuyaykurqani.
Otherwise, they’re easy.	Mana chayqa, paykunaqa facilmi kanku.
You don’t want to be that person, do you?.	Mana chay runa kayta munankichu, ¿aw?.
This guy is less.	Kay runaqa aswan pisi.
You’re a young person, you can’t give up.	Wayna runam kanki, manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
Everything was still, everything.	Tukuy imapas hinallam karqa, tukuy imapas.
It was a nice big black one.	Sumaq hatun yana kasqa.
But he will be the one.	Ichaqa paymi kanqa.
He knew exactly how she felt.	Payqa allintan yacharqan imayna sientekusqanmanta.
This thing is serious.	Kay imapas serio.
Tell this story well.	Kay willakuyta allinta willay.
But there is, now.	Ichaqa kanmi, kunanqa.
He was a handsome man, after all.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa, tukuy imamanta.
I was a nobody.	Ñuqaqa mana pipas karqani.
He was worried about being put down.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan churasqa kananmanta.
He noticed the timing.	Payqa repararqanmi chay tiempota.
I don’t want to go to school.	Manam yachay wasiman riyta munanichu.
So it was a bad thing.	Chaymi mana allin karqa.
You’re going to go now.	Kunanmi rinki.
About how hard it can be.	Imayna sasa kanman chaymanta.
It would have been nice to have him.	Allinmi kanman karqa paywan kayqa.
That wasn’t the case at all.	Chayqa manan ni imapipas karqanchu.
He was always early.	Payqa sapa kutim temprano karqa.
You are such a person.	Chayna runam kanki.
More difficult that way, for sure.	Aswan sasa chay hinaqa, seguro.
I thought he was as smart as I was.	Ñuqaqa ñuqa hina yachaysapa kananpaqmi piensarqani.
They were amazing.	Paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Obviously he’s very unhappy.	Sut’inmi payqa ancha mana kusisqachu kashan.
I know it can’t be me.	Yachanim mana ñuqa kayta atiymanchu.
Great man here now.	Hatun runa kaypi kunan.
I didn’t really want a car anyway.	Manam anchatachu munarqani imayna kaptinpas huk carrota.
I know he means well.	Yachanim allinta niyta munan.
A few months, a year maybe.	Iskay kimsa killa, huk wata ichapas.
Not yet anyone.	Manaraqmi pipas.
They are all over the house.	Tukuy wasipi kachkanku.
This should do just fine.	Kayqa allintam ruwanan.
I will be more realistic.	Aswan chiqap yuyayniyuqmi kasaq.
I have no idea why not, but you can't.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku mana, ichaqa manam atiwaqchu.
I wanted to be pretty for you.	Qampaq sumaq rikchayniyuq kaytam munarqani.
He didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manan yacharqanchu.
There is a morning.	Paqarinmi kan.
Tired, but happy.	Sayk’usqa, ichaqa kusisqa.
Now we have to do it again.	Kunanqa yapamanta ruwananchik tiyan.
He’s not always like that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
He isn’t feeling well.	Payqa manam allinchu kachkan.
You know it’s there.	Yachanki chaypi kashasqanmanta.
Yes, it’s that time again.	Arí, chay tiempon yapamanta.
It would have been time.	Tiempo kanman karqan.
If anyone is to blame, it’s me.	Pipas huchayoq kaptinqa ñuqam kani.
If you think about it, this is a good thing.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi kayqa.
You’re angry and scared.	Phiñasqa, mancharisqa ima kanki.
I need to do that better.	Chaytaqa aswan allintam ruwanay.
Anywhere but here.	Maypipas ichaqa kaypi.
He was almost angry and cold.	Yaqapaschá phiñasqa, chiri hina kasqa.
I would love to learn how to do everything.	Anchatam munani tukuy ima ruwayta yachayta.
I didn’t think it would work for me.	Manam piensarqanichu ñuqapaq allin kananta.
But that may not be the case now.	Ichaqa kunanqa manañan chay hinachu kanman.
There wasn’t, he said.	Manam karqachu, nispa.
First and foremost truth.	Ñawpaq kaq, qhepa kaq cheqaq kaq.
People are hurting all the time.	Runakunaqa sapa kutim k’irisqa kachkanku.
It is difficult but certainly worth it.	Sasam ichaqa segurom allinpaq.
And that was really good.	Hinaspa chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
They were cold and angry.	Paykunaqa chiri, phiñasqa karqanku.
That means no reason.	Chayqa mana imaraykupas niyta munan.
Another problem at the time.	Huk sasachakuy chay tiempopi.
But he doesn’t want those things.	Ichaqa manan chaykunataqa munanchu.
And always.	Hinaspa sapa kuti.
An hour late.	Huk hora tarde.
He didn’t know why or how.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku nitaq imaynatachus chayta.

That's always the worst time.	Chayqa sapa kutim aswan mana allin pacha.

I know this is important.	Yachanim kayqa ancha allin kasqanmanta.
You did well there.	Chaypin allinta ruwarqanki.
I am very, very sorry.	Anchatam llumpayta llakikuni.
It really wasn't too bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha mana allinchu karqa.

Ultimately it’s up to you to take action.	Qhepamanmi qanmanta kanqa imakunatapas ruwanaykipaq.
So that will do it.	Chaymi chaymi ruwanqa.
Not too bad there.	Mana ancha mana allinchu chaypi.
Stupid, stupid me.	Sonso, sonso ñuqa.

They may not agree.	Manapaschá acuerdopichu kanku.
Sorry, was all he said.	Pampachaykuway, chayllam nirqa.
The strangest thing.	Aswan mana riqsisqa kaq.

At least there’s that.	Aswanpas kanmi chaymanta.

Tell me here tomorrow.	Paqarin kaypi willaway.

That would never do.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanmanchu.
He may have been insecure before but not anymore.	Payqa yaqapaschá ñawpaqtaqa mana segurochu karqan ichaqa manañan.
I knew ahead of time, but I never did it.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani, ichaqa manam haykapipas ruwarqanichu.
What he knew all along.	Tukuy tiempo yachasqanmanta.
Maybe so, maybe not.	Ichapas chayna, ichapas mana.
I did it alone.	Sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqani.
But they eventually agreed.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi acuerdopi karqanku.
There's a house.	Chaypi wasi.
One of them is black.	Hukninmi yana.
Now the next one.	Kunanqa qatiqnin.
Anything you want.	Imapas munasqayki.
That ugly black.	Chay millay yana.
Not so unreasonable.	Mana chayna mana yuyayniyuqchu.
Not so lonely anymore.	Manaña chayna sapallanchu.
We had a lot of success that way.	Chaynatam achka allinta ruwarqayku.
All of them were considered good.	Llapallankum allinpaq hapisqa karqaku.
He’s always there.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi.
He was not happy with me.	Payqa manam ñuqawanqa kusisqachu karqa.
She didn't know how to say what she was feeling.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus sientekusqanmanta imayna niyta.
He was going to celebrate next month.	Payqa hamuq killapin fiestata ruwanan karqan.
It was an evil beauty.	Huk millay sumaq kaymi karqan.
I don’t want you to be like him.	Manam munanichu pay hina kanaykita.
I doubt it, unfortunately.	Iskayrayani, llakikuypaqmi.
Now he had to go.	Kunanqa rinan karqan.
We have more people with us.	Aswan achka runakunam ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
But it wasn’t there.	Ichaqa manan karqanchu.
I never felt happy.	Manam haykapipas kusisqachu tarikurqani.
Even so, maybe that's all.	Chayna kaptinpas ichapas chaylla kanman.
He was better than this.	Paymi kaymanta aswan allin karqa.
He’s good to be around.	Payqa allinmi paywan kayqa.
Here’s the other one.	Kaypi huknin kaq.
I really think it should.	Chiqaptam piensani chayna kananta.
It was almost entirely his.	Yaqa llapanpim paypaq karqa.
Be quick, but don’t rush.	Usqhaylla ruway, ichaqa ama usqhaylla ruwaychu.
Now we had to do better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam ruwanayku karqa.
It’s not easy to be sure.	Manam facilchu seguro kayqa.
I really had no one to talk to.	Chiqaptaqa manam piwanpas rimanaypaq karqachu.
I really wanted this.	Kaytaqa anchatam munarqani.
In a car, in the morning.	Huk carropi, tutamanta.
That’s me now.	Chayqa ñuqam kunanqa.
So he knows the job.	Chaymi payqa chay llamkayta yachan.
You're doing the right thing, but you know it.	Allintam ruwachkanki, ichaqa chaytam yachanki.
I'm trying to be nice to you.	Qamwan allinta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
He must have been disappointed.	Payqa yaqapaschá hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
I really know exactly what he means by that.	Chiqaptam allinta yachani chaywan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He came here to the house.	Kayman hamurqa chay wasiman.
All of them, however, were amazing.	Llapallanku ichaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Maybe it’s about that.	Ichapas chaymantaqa.
I want to learn the job.	Chay llamk’ayta yachayta munani.
Find out what really matters to you and why.	Yachay imakuna chiqaptapuni qampaq ancha allin kasqanmanta hinaspa imanasqa kasqanmanta.
No one knows how he did it.	Manan pipas yachanchu imaynatachus chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That he couldn’t find it.	Mana tariyta atisqanmanta.
Then I’m there.	Chaymantaqa ñuqaqa kachkani.
They're probably almost, you know.	Paykunaqa yaqapaschá yaqapaschá, yachanki.
But I couldn’t be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanichu.
How to know the truth.	Imayna chiqap yachay.
He got tired quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan sayk’usqa.
But things were not to be so simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas kanan karqan.
Now, that sounds strange.	Kunanqa, chayqa mana riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
That was two and a half years ago.	Chayqa iskay wata kuskan ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
He wasn't really sure.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu seguro kasharqan.
But even so, it is not easy.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas manam facilchu.
Really bad, actually.	Chiqap mana allin, chiqaptaqa.
Like the other one.	Huknin hina.
It was funny really.	Asikunapaq hinam karqa chiqaptapuni.
I just know there are a lot of them.	Chaylla yachani achka kasqankuta.
and everything else.	hinaspa tukuy imatapas.
One day he was gone.	Huk punchawmi manaña chaypichu karqa.
Tell me where I went wrong.	Maypi mana allin ruwasqayta willaway.
Angry and angry.	Phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima.
I didn’t know it could be like this.	Manam yacharqanichu kayna kanman chayta.
He’s a great guy there.	Payqa chaypi hatun runam.
This isn't really a big deal.	Kayqa manam chiqap hatun ruwaychu.
All this time he knew everything about me.	Tukuy kay tiempopiqa tukuy imatam yacharqa ñuqamanta.
He is the most genuine person.	Payqa aswan chiqap runam.
But I wanted to talk to you.	Ichaqa qanwan rimayta munarqani.
Don’t do anything yet.	Manaraq imatapas ruwaychu.
This is the best, after all.	Kaymi aswan allinqa, tukuy imamanta.
It wasn’t bad at all!!!.	Manam mana allinchu karqa ni imapipas!!!.
He is not yet a man.	Payqa manaraqmi runachu.
You have a strong sense of humor.	Qamqa sinchi yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
So much to keep it a secret.	Chaymi anchata pakasqa kananpaq.
I couldn’t tell you anything for sure.	Manam imatapas chiqaptaqa willayta atirqanichu.
But I doubt it is.	Ichaqa iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta.
Of course, he knew nothing about me.	Arí, payqa manan imatapas ñoqamanta yacharqanchu.
Tell me, now.	Willaway, kunan.
It came again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta hamurqa.
That was probably about it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chaymanta karqan.
I think they look nice.	Yuyaykuni sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqankuta.
Everything will be fine here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
How could he stop talking about it.	Imaynatataq chaymanta manaña rimayta atirqachu.
It won’t be in the future.	Hamuq tiempopiqa manan kanqachu.
Maybe they were both mine anyway.	Ichapas iskayninku ñuqapa karqaku imayna kaptinpas.
But it was a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.
He is very quick and quick.	Payqa ancha utqaylla hinaspa utqayllam.
I really couldn’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam atirqanichu.
He can be sure, all right.	Payqa seguro kanman, allinmi.
I did really well, actually.	Chiqaptam allinta ruwarqani, chiqaptaqa.
You today, me tomorrow.	Qam kunan punchaw, ñuqa paqarin.
Again, there was nothing.	Yapamanta, mana imapas karqachu.
But it was pretty amazing.	Ichaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Unfortunately, it’s fine.	Llakikuypaqmi, allinmi.
I always wanted to do this.	Sapa kutim kayta ruwayta munarqani.
He wants two things.	Payqa iskay imatam munan.
He said he was very proud of what I did.	Paymi nirqa ruwasqaymanta ancha orgulloso kasqanmanta.
So everything seems to be in order.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allinpaq hina kachkan.
One would be the injured person.	Hukninmi kanman k’irisqa runa.
Maybe this isn’t such a bad thing.	Ichapas kayqa mana chayna mana allinchu kanman.
No, not really .	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu .
She wasn't quite ready to be alone with him.	Payqa manan allintachu listo kasharqan paywan sapallan kananpaq.
He would do this.	Payqa kaytan ruwanman.
This is doing a lot.	Kayqa achkatam ruwachkan.
He really wants me to go.	Payqa anchatam munan rinaypaq.
That's why you made this journey.	Chayraykum kay puriyta ruwarqanki.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manam allinchu ruwayqa.
Everything is here.	Tukuy imapas kaypi kachkan.
I did the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwarqa.
That was the whole process.	Chayqa karqan llapan ruwaymi.
And they’re both terrified.	Hinaspa iskayninku mancharisqa kanku.
I just thought you’d be happy.	Chayllaraqmi yuyaykurqani kusisqa kanaykita.
That practice, however, was virtually non-existent.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa yaqa manaña karqanchu.
Are they right.	¿Allinchu kanku.
Now,  .	Kunan, .
That’s where he’s good.	Chaypim payqa allin.
There wasn't, so it went fast.	Manam karqachu, chaymi utqaylla rirqa.
I really didn’t want to.	Chiqaptaqa manam munarqanichu.
However, it wasn’t a good one.	Ichaqa, manan allinchu karqan.
That always made everything worse.	Chayqa sapa kutim tukuy imata aswan mana allinta ruwaq.
Where with me.	Maypichus ñuqawan.
A beautiful world.	Huk sumaq pacha.
Tell him what you think of him.	Paymanta ima yuyaykusqaykita willay.
This requires clarity.	Chaypaqqa sut’inmi kanan.
That would be a big problem later on.	Chayqa qhepamanmi hatun sasachakuy kanman karqan.
More than one, perhaps.	Hukmanta aswan, ichapas.
It’s a cold night outside.	Hawapi chiri tuta.
I don’t want him to be there.	Manam munanichu chaypi kananta.
But this is as it should be.	Ichaqa kayqa imayna kanan hinan.
But right now, he's scared.	Ichaqa kunanpacha, mancharisqa kachkan.
I’m not sure how or why.	Manam segurochu kani imayna nitaq imarayku.
But he does not know that this is the case.	Ichaqa manan yachanchu chhayna kasqanmantaqa.
I pretend they are not.	Mana kasqankuta hinam ruwani.
And then we did something.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa imatapas ruwarqayku.
He spoke with it.	Chaywanmi rimarqan.
I want to fix this for good.	Kayta allinpaq allichayta munani.
The first is unique.	Ñawpaq kaqmi sapallan.
I don’t know how, really.	Mana yachanichu imayna, chiqaptapuni.
After that, he was alone again.	Chay qhepamanmi hukmanta sapallan kasharqan.
I wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu tarikurqani.
But he seems very depressed.	Ichaqa llumpay llakisqa hinam kachkan.
So, the easier it is to eat, the better.	Chaymi, aswan facil mikhuy kaptinqa, aswan allinmi.
Not anywhere anywhere.	Mana maypipas maypipas.
You have many, many ideas.	Achka, achka yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I will never agree to that.	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas acuerdopichu kasaq.
I don’t intend to come this way again.	Manam kay ñanta yapamanta hamuyta yuyaykunichu.
He sounds tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa hinan uyarikun.
That makes me feel a little better.	Chayqa huk chhikantan allinta sientekuni.
I know you can be better.	Yachanim aswan allin kayta atisqaykita.
He was cold and sad.	Payqa chiri, llakisqa kasqa.
The older person should be taller.	Kuraq runaqa aswan hatunmi kanan.
And now he was out there, somewhere.	Hinaspa kunanqa chay hawapi kasqa, maypipas.
But it can certainly do some good.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin wakin allin ruwaykunata ruwayta atinman.
He refused to believe that it was.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu chay hina kasqanta.
It just happened, nothing happened.	Chayllam pasarqa, manam imapas karqachu.
Nothing too difficult.	Mana imapas ancha sasachu.
But most of the time, no.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim, manam.
It’s a really great piece.	Chiqamanta hatun kuska.
But here we are more certain.	Ichaqa kaypiqa aswan segurom kachkaniku.
But they are happy.	Ichaqa kusisqan kashanku.
What was it for him? 	¿Imataq paypaq karqa?
That’s the one thing.	Chayqa chay huk kaqmi.
But you probably did.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqanki.
Sure, he was worried about everything.	Seguro, payqa tukuy imamanta llakisqa kasharqan.
I wasn’t happy, you know.	Manam kusisqachu karqani, yachanki.
And yes, that’s about it.	Hinaspa arí, chaymantam.
Okay, maybe he would.	Allinmi, ichapas payqa ruwanman.
They were so foolish.	Paykunaqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
I mean, he’s a really good player.	Niyta munani, payqa chiqap allin pukllaqmi.
Of course .	Riki .
It doesn’t always have to be this way.	Manan sapa kutichu kay hina kanan.
He doesn’t have to do something this big.	Payqa manan kay hina hatun ruwaytaqa ruwananchu.
It’s all true.	Lliwmi chiqap.
I know that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam yachani.
They were so, so good.	Paykunaqa chayna, ancha allin karqaku.
No one said he did.	Manan pipas nirqanchu chay ruwasqanmanta.
And, it’s really good.	Hinaspa, chiqap allinmi.
Nobody wants it there.	Manan pipas chaypiqa munanchu.
He was the greatest good.	Paymi aswan hatun allin kaq karqan.
He was too quick.	Payqa llumpay utqayllam karqa.
A traveling man.	Huk puriq runa.
Now there was no one left.	Kunanqa manañam pipas kanchu karqa.
Once again, then.	Huk kutipi, chaymanta.
Not a human being.	Mana huk runachu.
I wish we hadn’t done that.	Mana chayta ruwanayku kanman karqan chayqa, allinmi kanman karqan.
He'd better not repeat it again.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana hukmanta yapamanta ruwananpaq.
Do you know where it is? 	¿Maypi kasqanmanta yachankichu?
He was action.	Payqa ruwaymi karqan.
I wasn’t the same person.	Manam kikin runachu karqani.
I have to do that.	Ñuqaqa chaytam ruwanay.
Learn how to fix it, then go for it.	Imayna allichayta yachay, chaymanta riy.
He told me it was mine.	Paymi niwarqa ñuqapa kasqanmanta.
I just never saw him, that’s all.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas paytaqa rikurqanichu, chaylla.
But I don’t like to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwaychu gustan.
I tried not to do that.	Mana chayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
I didn’t really know that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yacharqani.
Me, too, maybe.	Ñuqapas, ichapas.
He really can’t help it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana yanapayta atinchu.
He was hard to talk to.	Payqa sasam karqa rimayta.
To be truthful.	Chiqap kananpaq.
Repeat this step a few times.	Kay ruwayta iskay kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
He said he wanted a second chance.	Paymi nirqa iskay kaq oportunidadta munasqanmanta.
He spoke almost harshly.	Payqa yaqa sinchitan rimarqan.
I had to keep going.	Hinallam kanay karqa.
This process can really mean something.	Kay ruwayqa chiqamanta ima niyta atinman.
He told me there was no one.	Paymi niwarqa mana pipas kasqanmanta.
He knew what that would look like.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay imayna kananta.
What you did last night.	Qayna tuta ruwasqaykita.
You're going to be caught.	Hap'isqa kanki.
So he was worried about it.	Chaymi chaymanta llakisqa tarikurqa.
And one of them is making a movie.	Hinaspa hukninmi peliculata ruwachkan.
The first went well.	Ñawpaq kaqmi allinta rirqa.
And black people know that.	Hinaspa yana runakuna chayta yachanku.
Maybe that was stupid of me.	Ichapas chayqa ñuqapaq sonso kay karqa.
Most importantly, .	Aswan allinqa, .
He was a cold man.	Payqa chiri runam karqa.
It really is that simple!.	¡Chiqaptaqa chayna facilmi!.
I mean, anybody that could be, you know.	Niyta munani, pipas chay kanman, yachanki.
I hope he doesn’t.	Suyachkani mana ruwananta.
Not sure why that is.	Mana segurochu imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
Anyway, everything is fine now.	Imayna kaptinpas, kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He didn’t have to do anything he didn’t want to do.	Payqa manan ima mana munasqantapas ruwananchu karqan.
Strong but understated.	Sinchi ichaqa mana allin qhawarisqa.
But no, that’s not true.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
He always seemed so alone.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna sapallan rikchakurqa.
I'm making a game.	Huk pukllayta ruwachkani.
Too much of everything.	Llumpay tukuy ima.
And please do it soon.	Hinaspa ama hina kaspa, usqhaylla ruway.
He knew they were scared.	Payqa yacharqanmi mancharisqa kasqankuta.
That didn’t mean he couldn’t do it again.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu manaña hukmanta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I look forward to being here today.	Kunan punchaw kaypi kaytam suyachkani.
That he could believe it.	Chayqa creeyta atisqanmanta.
But this man was so amazing.	Ichaqa kay runaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I feel as bad about it as you do.	Ñoqapas qan hinan mana allintachu chaymanta sientekuni.
This statement is incorrect.	Kay rimayqa mana allinchu.
You know what you want to do.	Yachankim ima ruway munasqaykita.
It was a great experience, but a very difficult day.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, ichaqa ancha sasa punchawmi karqa.
Yes, people want to believe that.	Arí, runakunaqa chaytan creeyta munanku.
But it was still a bad day.	Ichaqa hinallam mana allin punchaw karqa.
I never wanted this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I was all right.	Ñuqaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqani.
He knew he needed sleep.	Payqa yacharqanmi puñuyta necesitasqanmanta.
He did this every day.	Chaynatam sapa punchaw ruwarqa.
He did all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruwarqa.
He won’t do it again.	Manam yapamanta ruwanqachu.
It's been around for about a year.	Yaqa huk watañam kachkan.
This, however, does.	Kaymi ichaqa ruwan.
So far, nothing has worked out.	Kunankamaqa manam imapas allinchu.
He should have done it a month earlier.	Chaytaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanan karqa.
But that would be ridiculous.	Ichaqa chayqa asikunapaq hinam kanman.
It was clear what was going to happen.	Sut’inmi karqan imachus pasananta.
I really hope it’s good.	Chiqamanta suyachkani allin kananta.
I'm pretty involved.	Ñuqaqa allintam chaypiqa kani.
I’m older than you.	Qammanta kuraq kani.
This guy was a guy.	Kay runaqa karqan.
But, then something looked really interesting.	Ichaqa, chaymanta imapas chiqap sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
They are always rich.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim qhapaq kanku.
It would be a good idea.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
I would do the same thing.	Ñuqapas chaynatam ruwayman.
He had no intention of finding out why.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imarayku chayta yachananpaq.
I never did that though.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwarqanichu ichaqa.
Maybe this is actually true.	Ichapas kayqa chiqap chiqap kanman.
He always had to go first.	Payqa sapa kutim puntata rinan karqa.
He’s the one they want.	Paymi munanku.
Please do it now.	Ama hina kaspa kunan ruway.
Actually doing things.	Chiqaptaqa imakunatapas ruwaspa.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam puriq.
Ten thirty in the morning.	Chunka kimsa chunka tutamanta.
But perhaps that was a mistake.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chay ruwasqanqa mana allinchu karqan.
It’s a mistake.	Pantasqa kachkan.
This is beauty, that is beauty.	Kayqa sumaq kaymi, chaymi sumaq kay.
You are the fastest.	Qamqa aswan utqayllam kanki.
Such a nice man, so to go.	Chayna sumaq runa, chayna rinanpaq.
But then it’s not good enough.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa mana allinchu.
He knew he could get it.	Payqa yacharqanmi hap’iyta atisqanmanta.
I am a man who has done nothing wrong.	Mana ima mana allin ruwaq runam kani.
How did this happen.	Imaynataq kayqa pasarqa.
I am really very sorry.	Chiqaptam anchata llakikuni.
He wanted to tell her something that would be good.	Payqa allin kananpaqmi imatapas willayta munarqa.
I feel fine so far.	Kunankamaqa allinmi tarikuni.
We cannot leave him.	Paytaqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
But there’s nothing really new about it.	Ichaqa manan imapas cheqaq mosoq chaypiqa kanchu.
This is a good thing to do.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwana.
Find out why it is unknown.	Yachay imanasqa mana riqsisqa kasqanmanta.
Like me, he’s never been here.	Ñoqa hina, manan hayk’aqpas kaypi karqanchu.
Maybe a few more than that.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan iskay kimsa.
What is the right thing to do.	Imatataq ruwana.
I can’t wait to make this dish again.	Mana suyayta atinichu kay mikhunata yapamanta ruwanaypaq.
The process is anything but simple.	Chay ruwayqa imapas ichaqa facilmi.
He wasn't there every day.	Payqa manam sapa punchawchu chaypi karqa.
So that’s just kind of there.	Chaymi chaylla huk laya chaypi.
You just have to keep doing it.	Qamqa hinallam ruwanayki.
We are really excited about this.	Chiqaptam kaymanta kusisqa kachkaniku.
You are absolutely insane.	Qamqa chiqaptam loco kanki.
So much about this.	Chaymi achka kaymanta.
Now about this.	Kunanqa kaymanta.
I had a really bad year last year.	Qayna wata chiqap mana allin wata karqani.
That was completely easy.	Chayqa llapanpim facil karqa.
But I couldn’t find it.	Ichaqa manan tariyta atirqanichu.
All right, you're .	Allinmi, qamqa .
The stranger was tired.	Chay mana riqsisqa runaqa sayk’usqa kasqa.
I can't figure out how to contact him.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imaynatam paywan rimayta.
I can get there.	Chayman chayayta atiyman.
He does not know what he will do next.	Payqa manan yachanchu qhepaman ima ruwananta.
For some reason he seemed rather irritated.	Imaraykupas aswan phiñasqa hinam karqa.
Prettier than that, really.	Aswan sumaq chaymanta, chiqap.
I know you're doing this.	Yachanim kayta ruwasqaykita.
You were too good today.	Kunan punchawmi llumpay allin karqanki.
I never knew anything about it.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa imatapas yacharqanichu.
I did not expect this.	Kaytaqa manam suyarqanichu.
What did it mean he was disappointed.	Imatataq niyta munarqa hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta.
You have a great idea.	Hatun yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
That’s a good thing, he says.	Chayqa allinmi, nispas nin.
All good people.	Tukuy allin runakuna.
A few days, a week, maybe two.	Iskay kimsa punchaw, huk semana, ichapas iskay.
Now tell me something.	Kunanqa imatapas willaway.
This is the ultimate truth.	Kaymi qhepa kaq cheqaq kaq.
He was great in every way.	Payqa tukuy imapipas hatunmi karqa.
There is one thing there.	Chaypiqa huk kaqmi kachkan.
For whatever reason that happened.	Imaraykupas chay pasasqanmanta.
Maybe he’ll be here tonight.	Ichapas kunan tuta kaypi kanqa.
He wanted to know what she looked like.	Payqa ima rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam yachayta munarqa.
There were two main events.	Iskay hatun ruwaymi karqan.
Dozens, everywhere.	Chunka chunka, maypipas.
One of them was a stranger to me.	Hukninmi mana riqsisqay karqa.
We had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayku karqa.
That’s still the best.	Chayqa kunankamapas aswan allinqa.
Probably will be later.	Yaqapaschá qhepaman kanqa.
I really want to do it.	Chiqamanta ruwayta munani.
Why does it take so much time.	¿Imanasqataq chay ruwayqa ancha tiempota necesitan.
This is going to be huge for me.	Kayqa ancha hatunmi kanqa ñuqapaq.
No one can believe it.	Manan pipas creeyta atinmanchu.
No, he’s not alone.	Manan, manan sapallanchu.
Not all that well.	Mana tukuy chay allintachu.
That could have been a good story.	Chayqa allintam willakuyta atinman karqa.
So, it takes a lot of time.	Chaymi, achka tiempota necesitan.
You are there, but you are not there.	Qamqa chaypim kachkanki, ichaqa manam chaypichu kachkanki.
You can’t tell.	Mana yachayta atiwaqchu.
Eventually he agreed to do so.	Qhepamanmi chayta ruwananpaq arí nisqa.
And one day this world.	Hinaspa huk punchaw kay pacha.
It's good, it's good, it's good.	Allinmi allinmi allin.
But then this was it.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa kaymi karqan.
Maybe those people were.	Ichapas chay runakunaqa karqa.
He looked fine, which was good.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa, chayqa allinmi karqa.
He is my	Payqa ñuqapa .
That’s what we are like as humans.	Chayqa runakuna hinam kanchik.
He’s not here, though .	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan, ichaqa .
He does it many times.	Achka kutitam chayta ruwan.
They certainly know that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yachanku.
I'm pretty good, actually.	Allin allinmi kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I’m not sure what to do.	Ñuqapas chayna kani.
Every day is a moment.	Sapa punchawmi huk rato.
Being as you are now does nothing for you.	Kunan hina kayqa manan imatapas ruwanchu qanpaq.
He was nothing like that.	Payqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
Unfortunately, however,	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi, .
But there's a little something he wants you to do.	Ichaqa kanmi huk chikan imapas ruwanaykita munan.
We need to do a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwananchik.
He didn’t want to buy anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rantiyta munarqanchu.
He couldn’t sit down at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas tiyayta atirqanchu.
More every day.	Aswan sapa punchaw.
Like really angry.	Chiqap phiñasqa hina.
Too big for no good.	Mana allinpaq ancha hatun.
I wasn’t the only one.	Manam ñuqallachu karqa.
You may never know how many there are.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas yachankichu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
That would be better anyway.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman imayna kaptinpas.
I think it should be good on its own.	Yuyaykuni sapallan allin kananta.
Something like that anyway.	Imapas chayna imayna kaptinpas.
He probably didn't know that.	Payqa manapaschá chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
You have the feeling that it’s not right for you.	Mana qampaq allinchu kasqanmanta yuyayniyuq kanki.
Everyone looked beautiful.	Lliwmi sumaq rikchayniyuq karqaku.
This thing is really amazing.	Kay imapas chiqap admirakuypaqmi.
Know what you want, know why you want it.	Yachay ima munasqaykita, yachay imarayku munasqaykita.
So tell it well.	Chaymi allinta willay.
This isn't the worst though.	Kayqa manam aswan mana allinchu ichaqa.
It was a good morning.	Allin paqarinmi karqa.
I thought it was great.	Hatun kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
So I wanted to know when he would be back.	Chaymi haykapi kutimunanta yachayta munarqani.
He wants to think about it as much as he can.	Atisqanman hinam chaypi yuyaymanayta munan.
Therefore, he was unable to work.	Chayraykum manaña llamkayta atirqachu.
I was tired of being alone at home all the time.	Wasipi sapa kuti sapallay kasqaymanta sayk’usqa karqani.
But the people were good.	Ichaqa runakunaqa allinmi karqanku.
I don’t want to do this though.	Manam ichaqa kayta ruwayta munanichu.
And that says a lot.	Hinaspa chayqa achkatam nin.
And then, three were really real.	Hinaspa chaymanta, kimsa chiqap chiqap karqaku.
You probably have a reason.	Yaqapaschá imaraykupas kanki.
It was the simple truth.	Chayqa karqan facil cheqaq kaqmi.
However, this may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa, manapaschá allinchu kanman kayqa.
He’s a terribly proud man.	Payqa manchay orgulloso runan.
But no, he was alone.	Ichaqa manan, payqa sapallanmi kasharqan.
So it seemed worse.	Chaymi aswan millay hina karqan.
He didn't know why he hadn't thought of it before.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaraykun ñawpaqta mana yuyaykurqanchu chayta.
It doesn’t really mean that there is a future.	Manam chiqaptachu niyta munan hamuq tiempo kasqanmantaqa.
We are not here to make things better.	Manam kaypichu kachkaniku imapas allin kananpaq.
If there is, great.	Sichus kan chayqa, hatunmi.
I just wasn’t ready.	Chaylla mana listochu karqani.
One, as easy as two .	Huk, iskay hina facil .
If anyone has a sense of humor.	Pipas yuyayniyuq kaptinqa.
Not at all.	Mana ni imapipas.
Then he began to work.	Chaymantam llamkayta qallaykurqa.
I don't need one here.	Kaypiqa manam hukta necesitasaqchu.
Two years outside.	Iskay wata hawapi.
Every day was another challenge.	Sapa punchawmi hukmanta huk sasachakuy karqa.
Go somewhere else.	Maymanpas riy.
Today, he has every reason to do so.	Kunan tiempopiqa tukuy imaraykun chayta ruwananpaqqa kan.
He told me not to mention his name.	Chaymi niwarqa sutinta mana rimanaypaq.
I really hope it never ever happens.	Chiqaptam suyachkani mana haykapipas haykapipas pasananta.
A little silly, but .	Huk chhikanta sonso, ichaqa .
I feel stupid now.	Kunanqa sonso hinam tarikuni.
He’s not ready yet.	Payqa manaraqmi listochu kashan.
Of course, it had to be.	Chiqamanta, chayna kanan karqa.
I’m not too sure yet.	Manaraqmi ancha segurochu kani.
She realized he was crazy.	Payqa repararqanmi loco kasqanmanta.
That doesn’t make sense.	Chayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
But the coffee was good.	Ichaqa chay kukata allinmi kasqa.
For some reason it was very easy for me.	Imaraykupas ancha facilmi karqa ñuqapaq.
Maybe it won’t work.	Ichapas mana allinchu kanqa.
And then the other day is yesterday.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk punchawqa qayna punchawmi.
And this is every.	Hinaspa kayqa sapa.
I felt safe.	Seguro hinam tarikurqani.
But I couldn’t figure it out.	Ichaqa manan chayta yachayta atirqanichu.
He is in everything.	Paymi tukuy imapipas.
No one could believe it, no one.	Manan pipas creeyta atirqanchu, manan pipas.
They were terrified and devastated.	Paykunaqa llumpay mancharisqa, llumpay llakisqa karqaku.
I didn’t know how this could happen.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kayqa kanman chayta.
And that couldn’t be more true here.	Hinaspa chayqa manan kaypiqa aswan cheqaqchu kanman.
He couldn't hear any more.	Manas astawan uyariyta atirqachu.
But yeah, that’s the reality.	Ichaqa arí, chaymi cheqaq kaq.
She seemed attractive.	Payqa munaymanmi rikchakurqa.
Tomorrow is not school.	Paqarin mana yachay wasi.
I want to buy a new car.	Musuq carrota rantiyta munani.
They were both more than ready.	Iskayninkum aswan listoña karqaku.
He was always cold.	Payqa sapa kutim chiri karqa.
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam karqa.
You know that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yachanki.
I really couldn’t say.	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atirqanichu.
He still looks like it.	Payqa hinallam rikchakun.
He says he likes working there.	Paymi nin chaypi llamkayta gustasqanmanta.
And then three times.	Hinaspa chaymanta kimsa kutita.
Now he can sleep like crazy.	Kunanqa loco hinam puñuyta atin.
Eventually he looked back.	Qhepamanmi qhepaman qhawarirqan.
But not yet, no.	Ichaqa manaraqmi, manan.
But it was such a first.	Ichaqa chay hina ñawpaq kaqmi karqan.
How do you know? 	¿Imaynatataq yachanki?
I was so excited.	Llumpay kusisqam tarikurqani.
The one that was going to leave.	Ripunanpaq kaq.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa karqanchu.
They were lucky, indeed.	Paykunaqa suerteyoqmi karqanku, cheqaqtapunin.
It’s not good here.	Kaypiqa mana allinchu.
I just wanted everything.	Chayllam tukuy imatapas munarqani.
Everything was good, but it could have been better.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa, ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman karqa.
But I don’t know why.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku.
Maybe I'll never fit in again, actually.	Ichapas manaña haykapipas chayman hinachu kasaq, chiqaptaqa.
However, it didn’t come well.	Ichaqa, manan allintachu hamurqan.
Now you are like me.	Kunanqa ñuqa hinam kanki.
Be more confidential.	Aswan pakasqa kay.
I want to be better.	Aswan allin kaytam munani.
He did many of these things.	Chaykunataqa achkatam ruwarqa.
No one knows yet.	Manaraqmi pipas yachanchu.
That’s what we have to do.	Chayqa chaytam ruwana.
You cannot understand that.	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atiwaqchu.
I want to work with it more.	Chaywanmi astawan llamkayta munani.
If yes, do so.	Arí nisqa kaptinqa chayta ruway.
Here, . . . .	Kaypiqa, .
So this is something else.	Chaymi kayqa huk imapas.
And there’s some truth to that, yes.	Hinaspa chaypiqa kanmi wakin chiqap, arí.
Most people, in fact.	Yaqa llapan runakuna, chiqaptaqa.
Intelligent, very serious.	Yachaysapa, ancha serio.
Everyone is good at something.	Lliwmi imapipas allin kanku.
To make it more efficient.	Aswan allinta ruwanapaq.
I mean tonight.	Kunan tutamanta niyta munani.
A man, people.	Huk runa, runakuna.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chaytaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
He seems a little sad again.	Hukmanta huk chikan llakisqa hinam kachkan.
At least, he was anything but.	Aswanpas, payqa imapas karqan ichaqa.
It was difficult.	Sasa karqan.
How could he not.	Imaynataq mana atirqachu.
And innocent.	Hinaspa mana huchayoq.
Would you like to do more?.	¿Astawan ruwayta munankichu?.
So he lost his hearing.	Chayraykum manaña uyariyta atirqachu.
I know how hard it is.	Yachanim ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
That’s not what this is at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas kayqa.
It could still be worse.	Kunankamapas aswan mana allinmi kanman.
It just seems harder and harder.	Aswan sasa aswan sasa hinallam rikchakun.
He was pretty good.	Payqa allin allinmi karqa.
It means that the thing is always there.	Chayqa ninmi chay imapas sapa kuti kasqanmanta.
I hear it better.	Aswan allintam uyarini.
And again next year.	Hinaspa yapamanta hamuq wata.
I'm so glad he's here today.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kunan punchaw kaypi kasqanmanta.
He came very, very impressed.	Ancha ancha admirasqa hamurqa.
I can’t speak for you.	Manam qampaq rimayta atiymanchu.
I hope everything works out for him.	Suyachkani tukuy imapas paypaq allin kananpaq.
He wanted to be better.	Payqa aswan allin kaytan munarqan.
Please tell me how to do it.	Ama hina kaspa, imayna ruwanaypaq willaway.
I don’t really know what to say about that.	Manam allintachu yachani chaymanta ima niyta.
What is that your	Imataq chay qampa .
I didn’t want to be bad again.	Manam yapamanta mana allin kayta munarqanichu.
Other than that, he was easy.	Mana chaymantaqa, payqa facilmi karqa.
And anyway there I am.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas chaypim kachkani.
The success was even more impressive.	Chay allin ruwasqanqa aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He couldn't remember what it was now.	Manas kunan ima kasqanmanta yuyariyta atirqachu.
There were certainly many.	Cheqaqtapunin askha karqan.
Please do so!.	Ama hina kaspa, chaynata ruway!.
But I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu chaymanta chay hatun kananta.
But now he is fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi kashan.
I know he doesn't really like it.	Yachanim mana anchatachu gustasqanmanta.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa mana allinchu kanman.
But things went a bit wrong.	Ichaqa imapas huk chhikantan mana allintachu rirqan.
He was no longer a man.	Manañam runachu karqa.
I feel all of them.	Llapallankum sientekuni.
You want to hear that.	Chayta uyariyta munanki.
He would be foolish.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Someone could have been very, very hurt.	Pipas ancha, ancha k’irisqa kanman karqan.
Yes, he thinks it belongs to him.	Arí, payqa piensanmi paypaq kananpaq.
But he got it.	Ichaqa chaytan chaskirqan.
That was twenty years ago, about the same time.	Chayqa iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa, yaqa chayna tiempopi.
No one really thinks about it.	Chaypiqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yuyaykun.
You’re the only one who does it.	Qamllam ruwanki.
To be nothing.	Mana imapas kananpaq.
It was good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa allinmi karqa.
I didn’t want to be mean anymore.	Manañam millay kayta munarqanichu.
We need to do these things properly.	Chaykunataqa allintam ruwananchik.
Who knows what the future holds?.	¿Pitaq yachan hamuq tiempopi imakuna pasananta?.
And you will have a better mind and a better mind.	Hinaspa aswan allin yuyayniyuq hinaspa aswan allin yuyayniyuq kanki.
He wants to know the truth.	Payqa munanmi cheqaq kaqta yachayta.
This is one of the hardest things to do.	Kayqa hukninmi aswan sasa ruwaymi.
I mean, it is.	Niyta munani, kachkan.
That can be as tough as it gets for you.	Chayqa qanpaq hina sinchi sasa kanman.
I don’t get that.	Manam chaytaqa tarinichu.
Now he thinks he’ll never win.	Kunanqa mana hayk’aqpas atipananta yuyaykun.
The sad one.	Llakisqa kaq.
But it doesn’t work out.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwan.
I don't hear that very often.	Chaytaqa manam ancha sapa kutichu uyarini.
Maybe you didn’t know.	Ichapas mana yacharqankichu.
But then it’s not bad at all.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan mana allinchu ni imapipas.
That means someone is here.	Chayqa niyta munan pipas kaypi kasqanmanta.
That’s an easy thing to do.	Chayqa facil ruwaymi.
He made a big deal out of it.	Paymi chaymanta hatun ruwayta ruwarqan.
And that’s what it’s worth.	Hinaspa chaymi chayman hina.
He does everything and does everything well.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwan, tukuy imatapas allintam ruwan.
And it went well.	Hinaspa allinta rirqa.
Pretend you haven’t done it.	Mana ruwasqaykita hina ruway.
I don’t have to do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwanay.
He knew how to win.	Payqa yacharqanmi atipayta.
That all seemed a little too familiar.	Chay tukuy imapas huk chikan ancha riqsisqa hinam karqa.
And, then, there is time.	Hinaspa, chaymanta, kanmi pacha.
There is much, much faster processing speed.	Aswan, aswan utqaylla ruway utqaylla kan.
Otherwise, it is not	Mana chayqa, manan .
It was great for that.	Chaypaqqa hatunmi karqa.
That was great, that was good.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, chayqa allinmi karqa.
At the time, no one knew who they were.	Chay tiempopiqa manan pipas yacharqanchu pikuna kasqankuta.
He didn't really mean it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaynata niyta munarqa.
He was probably as surprised as she was.	Payqa yaqapaschá pay hina admirasqa kasharqan.
This is a time for action.	Kayqa ruwanapaq tiempon.
So yeah that’s really it.	Chaymi arí chaymi chiqaptapuni.
And he’s angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kashan.
It just wasn’t there.	Chaylla mana chaypichu karqa.
He was a terrible secret.	Payqa manchay pakasqa kasqa.
I can’t do those things.	Manam chaykunataqa ruwaymanchu.
It is important to speak here.	Kaypi rimayqa ancha allinmi.
We cannot ignore that.	Chaytaqa manam mana uyariyta atichwanchu.
Married .	Casarasqa .
Sure, he did, but it wasn’t good enough.	Chiqamanta, payqa ruwarqan, ichaqa mana allinchu karqa.
I just don’t like it.	Chaylla mana gustawanchu.
Really really really.	Chiqap chiqap chiqap.
Learn, you know, what it’s like.	Yachay, yachanki, imayna kasqanmanta.
I really really need to do that.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta chay ruwayta necesitasaq.
And it goes further back.	Hinaspa aswan qhepamanmi rin.
It’s the same thing.	Chayna hinam kachkan.
But then something really didn't make me happy.	Ichaqa chaymanta imapas chiqaptam mana kusisqachu tarikurqani.
Lonely like me.	Ñoqa hina sapallan.
You’ve done a great job on this before.	Kaymantaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi hatun ruwayta ruwarqanki.
It had been a long time now.	Unayñan kunanqa karqan.
John, he knew.	Juan, payqa yacharqanmi.
I was pretty drunk that night.	Chay tutaqa allintam machasqa karqani.
After that, this happened.	Chay qhepamanmi kay hina karqan.
But we have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintam ruwananchik.
He didn’t seem as tired as he was yesterday.	Qayna punchaw hinam mana sayk’usqa hinachu karqa.
He was good at baseball.	Payqa allinmi karqan béisbol nisqapi.
One, however, must come first.	Hukninmi ichaqa ñawpaqpi kanan.
He’s a very good guy.	Payqa llumpay allinmi.
What came out was big and intense.	Imachus lluqsirqa hatun, sinchi karqa.
They've been here all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi kaypi kachkanku.
He began to remember.	Yuyariyta qallaykurqa.
You know, like, yeah.	Yachanki, hina, arí.
One of the biggest.	Huknin hatun.
You can never do that again.	Chaytaqa manañan hayk’aqpas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That won’t happen unless you do.	Chayqa manan kanqachu, manachus chayta ruwawaq chayqa.
Can’t imagine what the problem could be.	Mana yuyaymanayta atinchu ima sasachakuy kanman chayta.
Nothing was going to be right.	Manam imapas allinchu kanan karqa.
This didn't seem realistic.	Kayqa manam chiqap hinachu karqa.
So he asked her to do it again.	Chaymi hukmanta ruwananpaq nirqa.
He was a cold, mean man.	Payqa chiri, mana allin runam karqa.
There are angry people here.	Kaypiqa phiñasqa runakunam kachkan.
This was a real morning.	Kaymi karqa huk chiqap paqarin.
I am eager to see what lies ahead.	Anchatam munani imakuna ñawpaqpi kananta qawayta.
You know how to fix it.	Yachankim imayna allichayta.
Eat some food.	Wakin mikhunata mikhuy.
I wasn’t that good either.	Ñuqapas manam chayna allinchu karqani.
I wonder what it is.	Tapukuni ima kasqanmanta.
This is not what it used to be.	Kayqa manam ñawpaq hinachu.
The night was finally safe.	Chay tutaqa qhepamanmi seguro kasharqan.
Perhaps he knew that.	Yaqapaschá chayta yacharqa.
I know how smart you are.	Yachanim imayna yachaysapa kasqaykita.
I really wish he would do it more often.	Chiqaptam munani aswan sapa kuti chayta ruwananta.
Nothing half an hour, an hour.	Mana imapas kuskan hora, huk hora.
No, things went a bit wrong here.	Manan, kaypiqa imapas huk chhikantan mana allintachu rirqan.
A very big problem.	Ancha hatun sasachakuy.
I don’t want to be that real.	Manam chayna chiqap kayta munanichu.
Not difficult at all.	Mana sasachu ni imapipas.
That was older than me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta aswan kuraq karqa.
But this is more difficult.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan sasam.
Maybe now was the time.	Ichapas kunanqa chay tiempo karqa.
We can’t be that way.	Manam chayna kayta atichwanchu.
I couldn’t understand it.	Mana entiendeyta atirqanichu.
It’s not like, fast or anything.	Mana hinachu, usqhayllachu nitaq imapas.
And it’s not bad.	Hinaspa mana mana allinchu.
Everything is the best thing to do.	Tukuy imapas ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
Obviously you should.	Sut’inmi chayta ruwanayki.
Unfortunately, this is the case.	Llakikuypaqmi kayna kachkan.
Maybe you were a little angry.	Ichapas pisi phiñasqa karqanki.
You just want to keep going.	Qamqa hinallam puriyta munanki.
He says this because he doesn’t want to.	Kaytaqa ninmi mana munasqanmanta.
People are hurt.	Runakuna k’irisqa kanku.
This approach is wrong, and maybe that’s all.	Kay ruwayqa mana allinchu, ichapas chaylla.
Almost too good.	Yaqa ancha allin.
But on another occasion.	Ichaqa huk kutipi.
He had a great mind.	Payqa hatun yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
And, there was time.	Hinaspa, tiempo karqan.
But he is a wise man.	Ichaqa yachaysapa runam.
If you want to leave, this is the time.	Ripuyta munanki chayqa, kaymi chay tiempo.
That’s what he said, at the time.	Chayta nirqa, chay pacha.
So yeah, pretty stupid.	Chaymi arí, sumaq sonso.
I didn’t really know.	Manam chiqaptachu yacharqani.
He never had the .	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay .
And this guy is.	Hinaspa kay runaqa.
I hope to work sooner.	Suyachkani aswan utqaylla llamkayta.
We agree quite a bit on that.	Chaymantaqa allintam acuerdopi kachkaniku.
No one knows about this.	Kaymantaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
He wants to be alone.	Sapallan kayta munan.
I want to be good.	Allin kaytam munani.
They are very nice now.	Kunanqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
But it would be good if it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman allin kaptinqa.
First of all, there is the novelty of everything.	Ñawpaqtaqa tukuy imamanta musuq kaymi kan.
I am so excited about this challenge.	Ñuqaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani kay sasachakuymanta.
I mean really really good.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta allin niyta munani.
He went alone.	Payqa sapallanmi rirqa.
They are very nice.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Someone opened it up.	Pipas chayta kicharirqa.
I know he wants to help.	Yachanim yanapayta munasqanmanta.
Now and always.	Kunan hinaspa sapa kuti.
Here's another thing to do.	Kaypi huk ruwaymi kachkan.
If you’re stupid, you’re stupid.	Sonso kanki chayqa, sonso kanki.
That way it would be easier.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi kanman.
But then, he runs into a problem.	Ichaqa chaymanta, huk sasachakuypi tarikun.
Maybe he was never really there.	Ichapas mana haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypiqa karqachu.
I’ve had that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan hap’ini.
You may not be so sure now.	Kunanqa manapaschá chayna segurochu kanki.
Humanity is not.	Runa kayqa manam.
He didn’t know what it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imatachus chayta.
Other than that, at least.	Mana chaymantaqa, aswanpas.
I think it’s great now.	Yuyaykuni kunanqa hatunmi.
You can’t say anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa ima niyta atiwaqchu.
That’s never been the case.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas chay ruwayqa karqanchu.
Anyway, unfortunately.	Imayna kaptinpas, llakikuypaqmi.
That left one needs more.	Chayqa saqirqa huk aswan necesitan.
They were expelled.	Paykunaqa qarqosqa karqanku.
And that was yesterday.	Hinaspa chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
I felt cold.	Chiri hinam tarikurqani.
There is nothing he can do.	Manan ima ruwaytapas atinmanchu.
He knows it's a bad time.	Payqa yachanmi mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta.
I know where he is now.	Yachanim kunan maypi kasqanmanta.
And eventually they were fired.	Hinaspa qhepamanmi qarqosqa karqanku.
No one can say that.	Manan pipas niyta atinmanchu.
Everything sounds infamous.	Tukuy imapas mana allin riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
That still seems good.	Chayqa kunankamapas allinmi rikchakun.
It’s really ugly.	Chiqamanta millay.
So he was here almost every day.	Chaymi yaqa sapa punchaw kaypi karqa.
There is no man this morning.	Kay paqarin runaqa manam kanchu.
I wanted to think about it.	Chaypin yuyaymanayta munarqani.
I mean, it’s great.	Niyta munani, ancha allinmi.
He was more angry than angry.	Payqa aswan phiñasqa kasqa phiñasqa kasqanmantaqa.
They all had a good time.	Llapallankum allin tiempopi karqaku.
They were very large.	Ancha hatunmi karqaku.
I can't find him anyway.	Manam payta tariyta atinichu imayna kaptinpas.
Thirty years ago.	Kimsa chunka wata ñawpaqta.
I hope it helps someone one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw pitapas yanapananta.
But then he seemed very happy.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
Do other things in another place.	Huk ruwaykunata huk maypi ruway.
I can’t sit still.	Manam tiyayta atinichu.
It didn’t do very well.	Mana ancha allintachu ruwarqan.
He got it pretty bad, probably .	Payqa sinchi mana allintan hap’irqan, yaqapaschá .
He’s there for you.	Payqa chaypi kachkan.
But he was the future.	Ichaqa paymi karqan hamuq tiempopi.
But first, you really have to do it.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanayki.
So I was the one.	Chaymi ñuqa karqani.
And he did, yes.	Hinaspa payqa ruwarqan, arí.
I am now an adult.	Kunanqa kuraq runam kani.
He died less than a week later.	Manaraq huk semana qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Sad and frustrated.	Llakisqa hinaspa hukmanyasqa.
I think that's kind of nice.	Chayqa huk laya sumaqmi nispam piensani.
We really didn’t do much.	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu ruwarqayku.
I don’t see how.	Manam rikunichu imaynata.
I don't want to be alone now.	Kunanqa manam sapallay kayta munanichu.

First, second, third.	Ñawpaq kaq, iskay kaq, kimsa kaq.
All right, go ahead.	Allinmi, riy.
But it really wasn’t too hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana ancha sasachu karqan.
It’s cold today.	Kunan punchawqa chiri.
He really had to do this.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kayta ruwanan karqan.
There was something hidden here.	Kaypiqa imapas pakasqa kasqa.
I still really like it.	Kunankamapas anchatam gustan.
He is never alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manan mana allinchu.
Young, scared and hurt.	Wayna, mancharisqa, k’irisqa ima.
I am as guilty of this as anyone.	Kaymantaqa pi runa hinam huchayoq kani.
However, there was one thing.	Ichaqa, huk kaqmi karqa.
You know it’s not like that.	Yachanki mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He knew they were too late.	Payqa yacharqanmi nishuta tarde kasqankuta.
Two problems with that.	Iskay sasachakuy chaywan.
If that’s the right thing to do.	Chay allin kaptinqa.
But that really doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayqa mana imananpaschu.
You’ve probably done it yourself.	Qampas yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
It would be good for me.	Allinmi kanman ñuqapaq.
He angrily refuses.	Payqa phiñasqa mana munanchu.
But they are not always the best.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu aswan allinqa kanku.
Then how many days.	Chaymanta hayka punchaw.
It would have been a bad thing.	Mana allintam ruwanman karqa.
It looks like a party there.	Chaypi huk fiestaman rikchakun.
No idea he wasn't.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi payqa mana karqachu.
That’s who he was.	Chayqa pichus karqan.
That went on for a month and a month.	Chayqa huk killa killa hinam karqa.
He can’t eat anything.	Payqa manan imatapas mikhuyta atinchu.
I never expected it to become so popular.	Manam haykapipas suyarqanichu chayna riqsisqa kananta.
The latter, however, is not a bad thing.	Chay qhepa kaqmi ichaqa manan mana allinchu.
But there’s a guy.	Ichaqa kanmi huk wayna.
All right, folks.	Allinmi, runakuna.
I can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
It’s time tonight.	Kunan tuta pacha kan.
Not like a big deal.	Mana hatun ruway hinachu.
But you know right away.	Ichaqa chayllam yachanki.
it’s not me.	mana ñuqachu.
I’ll do everything you want.	Tukuy ima munasqaykita ruwasaq.
He knew why.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku kasqanmanta.
But the process takes time.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa tiempotan necesitan.
Okay, okay, whatever.	Allinmi, allinmi, imapas.
Yes, it is about that.	Arí, chaymantam rimachkan.
Not being the best.	Mana aswan allin kay.
Now, it’s working again.	Kunanqa, yapamanta llank’ashan.
He said it strongly.	Sinchitan chayta nisqa.
But now everything was bigger.	Ichaqa kunanqa tukuy imapas aswan hatunmi kasqa.
State exactly what you want.	Ima munasqaykita allinta willay.
I wanted to be outside.	Hawapi kaytam munarqani.
But, it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa, manan imananpaschu.
But it’s not true here.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu kaypi.
He says he doesn't know how to answer the question.	Paymi nin mana yachanchu tapuyta kutichiyta.
That’s, it’s not.	Chayqa, manam.
You can’t buy it anywhere else.	Manan maypipas rantiyta atiwaqchu.
I knew how to get away with it too.	Ñuqapas chaymanta lluqsiyta yacharqanim.
Isn’t that the other.	Manachu chay huk.
She sure is beautiful though.	Payqa seguro sumaqmi ichaqa.
That gave me three days.	Chayqa kimsa punchawmi quwarqa.
Always, any of this, everything.	Sapa kuti, mayqin kaymanta, tukuy imamanta.
I wanted to be alone for a while.	Huk rato sapallay kaytam munarqani.
That wouldn’t be right at the moment.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman kunan tiempopi.
One day he would do it.	Huk punchawmi chayta ruwanman karqa.
It wasn't a disagreement.	Manam mana acuerdopichu karqa.
This process is incorrect.	Kay ruwayqa pantasqa kachkan.
No one knew how to find him.	Manan pipas payta tariyta yacharqanchu.
There was nothing like him here.	Kaypiqa manam pay hinaqa karqachu.
He says it happened more than once.	Paymi nin aswan huk kutilla chay pasasqanmanta.
Everything seemed innocent.	Tukuy imapas mana huchayoq hinam rikchakurqa.
Obviously it’s going to be good.	Sut’inmi allin kanqa.
Most of the time you fail.	Yaqa llapanpim mana allintachu ruwanki.
If he is sure.	Sichus payqa seguro kashan chayqa.
But he was always there.	Ichaqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
In fact, he had no idea how to do it.	Aswanpas manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatachus ruwananta.
It’s not easy to do.	Mana facilchu ruway.
It’s really important.	Chiqamanta ancha allin.
He told her not to do anything.	Paymi nirqa ama imatapas ruwananpaq.
Tomorrow will be worse.	Paqarinmi aswan mana allin kanqa.
Nothing was safe or secure.	Manam imapas segurochu nitaq segurochu karqa.
You are the tough one here.	Qamqa kaypi sinchi kaqmi kanki.
It really wasn't easy.	Chiqaptaqa manam facilchu karqa.
It would be so beautiful.	Chayna sumaqmi kanman.
Those two things would be a big deal.	Chay iskay ruwayqa hatun ruwaymi kanman.
We have no idea what it looks like.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kanchik imayna kasqanmanta.
But he couldn’t be anywhere.	Ichaqa manan maypipas kayta atirqanchu.
We were always busy.	Sapa kutim ocupasqa kaq kayku.
It’s not too bad, but it’s not up to par.	Manam ancha mana allinchu, ichaqa manam chayman hinachu.
He can be whatever he wants.	Payqa munasqanman hinam kanman.
John was a bad guy.	Juanqa mana allin runam karqa.
I think this will happen next year.	Hamuq wata kayqa kanqa nispan yuyaykuni.
He was set up.	Payqa churasqa karqan.
He was tired.	Sayk’usqa kasqa.
Either that statement is right or wrong.	Icha chay rimayqa allinchu icha mana allinchu.
Now you, please.	Kunanqa qam, ama hina kaspa.
But don't forget now.	Ama kunanqa qunqaychu.
You’re fine now.	Kunanqa allintam kanki.
Things that don’t belong to you.	Mana qampaq kaq imakuna.
They were tough.	Paykunaqa sinchitan karqanku.
You’re still in shock.	Hinallam mancharisqa kachkanki.
Beautiful man, couldn’t be nicer.	Sumaq runa, mana aswan sumaq kayta atinmanchu.
Anyway, there it is.	Imayna kaptinpas, chaypim kachkan.
You never want to sit there.	Manam haykapipas chaypi tiyayta munankichu.
She said no, he said yes.	Payqa manan nisqa, payqa arí nisqa.
They want the best and most efficient work.	Paykunaqa munanku aswan allin hinaspa allin llamkayta.
But this is what you mean.	Ichaqa kaytan niyta munanki.
Harder for you, boy.	Aswan sasa qampaq, wayna.
I want it set up for me.	Munani ñuqapaq churasqa kananta.
But this is a new day.	Ichaqa kayqa mosoq p’unchaymi.
There's no one who's ever done that.	Manan kanchu hayk'aqpas chayta ruwaq runaqa.
Please, that would have been nice.	Ama hina kaspa, chayqa sumaqmi kanman karqan.
But it is probably difficult.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá sasa.
Maybe you think this is stupid.	Ichapas kayqa sonso kananpaq yuyanki.
He certainly would have.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwanman karqan.
That’s easy to do.	Chayna ruwayqa facilmi.
It was the only chance.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqan chansa.
Maybe like a house all day.	Ichapas tukuy punchaw wasi hina.
For making the film.	Chay peliculata ruwasqanmanta.
I’m glad he’s there.	Kusikuni chaypi kasqanmanta.
So, that’s how scared.	Chaymi, chayna mancharisqa.
He said who they were.	Nisqa pikuna kasqankuta.
Know that this is true.	Kay chiqap kasqanmanta yachay.
This was a great experience for me.	Kayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq karqa.
But they know a lot.	Ichaqa anchatan yachanku.
He still wasn't sure it was true.	Payqa hinallam mana segurochu karqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
His own child.	Kikin wawa.
He had a tough day yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi sinchi punchaw karqa.
Like he doesn’t live with us.	Mana ñuqaykuwan tiyaq hina.
He did well, he did well.	Allintam ruwarqa, allintam ruwarqa.
There it was.	Chaypim chay karqa.
It’s a much more difficult task.	Aswan sasa ruwaymi.
His real name.	Chiqap sutin.
You just can’t seem to help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atiwaqchu hina.
It’s been a terrible week.	Manchay semanan karqan.
Stop being so foolish.	Amaña chayna mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
It’s terrible, it’s terrible, it’s not good.	Manchay, manchay, mana allinchu.
I didn’t want to quit, you know.	Mana saqiyta munarqanichu, yachanki.
I wasn’t happy or unhappy about it.	Mana kusisqachu nitaq mana kusisqachu chaytaqa ruwarqani.
He can’t go on like this.	Payqa manan kay hinaqa puriyta atinchu.
One of them had to go.	Hukninmi rinan karqa.
That’s it, that’s everything.	Chayqa, chaymi tukuy ima.
But it doesn’t matter to me now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu ñoqawanqa.
About three and a half years.	Yaqa kimsa wata kuskan.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas munarqanichu.
For the most part, you were successful.	Yaqa llapanpim allin ruwaq karqanki.
That’s obviously not good for you.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu qanpaq.
It means a lot to be here.	Kaypi kayqa anchatam niyta munan.
I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep.	Manam mikuyta atirqanichu, manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
I know that doesn't sound like much.	Yachanim chayqa mana ancha hinachu uyarikun.
He knew why she was so happy.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku ancha kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
It repeats itself over and over again.	Sapa kutim yapamanta riman.
Nothing will ever be right.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
Know who he is.	Pichus kasqanmanta yachay.
Many of us are drunk.	Achka runakunam machasqa kanchik.
I cannot be like that here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna kayta atiymanchu.
Be here or there.	Kayman utaq chayman kay.
There was no precedent.	Manam ñawpaq rimayqa karqachu.
It was wonderful to be with him.	Paywan kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Who is important.	Pichus importante kaq.
Do one thing each evening.	Sapa ch’isi huk ruwayta ruway.
They are always there.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim chaypi kachkanku.
Really really not happy about this.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta mana kusisqachu kaymanta.
He would have done this.	Payqa kaytan ruwanman karqan.
About a month or so.	Yaqa huk killa hina.
Starving at home.	Wasipi yarqaymanta.
I mean, it was kinda funny.	Niyta munani, huk rato asikunapaq hina karqan.
We’re here every year.	Sapa wata kaypi kayku.
He seemed worried about her.	Payqa paymanta llakisqa hinam karqa.
You never want to be outside.	Manam haykapipas hawapi kaytaqa munankichu.
He can do whatever he wants.	Payqa munasqanman hinan ruwanman.
That’s what he did to her.	Chaytan paytaqa ruwarqan.
I don’t really know what to do.	Manam allintachu yachani imata ruwanaypaq.
No one to help him.	Mana pipas yanapananpaq.
It still is, really.	Hinallam kachkan, chiqaptapuni.
That’s what you do to him.	Chaytan paytaqa ruwanki.
It lasted about a year.	Huk wata hinam karqa.
That’s going to be pretty big.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi kanqa.
We didn’t really talk much .	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu rimaq kayku .
Maybe not yet.	Ichapas manaraq.
So they’re there.	Chaymi paykunaqa chaypi kachkanku.
I think that was wrong.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqan, nispaymi yuyaykuni.
So far it is a daily routine.	Kunankamaqa sapa punchaw ruwaymi.
I don’t want to see it again.	Manam hukmanta qawayta munanichu.
Obviously, it’s you.	Sut’inmi, qanmi kanki.
Most certainly so.	Aswan seguro chay hina.
We are not good at everything.	Tukuy imatam mana allinchu kanchik.
Some really, really bad.	Wakin chiqap, chiqap mana allin.
You want to leave.	Ripuyta munanki.
He repeats it again and again.	Hukmanta hukmanta iskay kutita ruwan.
I mean, it was a ridiculous thing to do.	Niyta munani, asikunapaq hina ruwaymi karqan.
I’m the only one.	Ñuqallam.
If there was one last.	Sichus huk qhipa kaq karqan chayqa.
He sounds like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinam uyarikun.
The man seemed fine, indeed.	Chay runaqa allinmi rikchakurqa, chiqaptapuni.
Yes, they were all there.	Arí, chaypim llapallanku karqaku.
That was thoroughly inappropriate.	Chayqa allintam mana allinchu karqa.
And we’re lucky to have him with us.	Hinaspa suerteyoqmi kayku pay ñoqaykuwan kasqanmanta.
Like, very nice.	Imayna, ancha sumaq.
I want to work there.	Chaypi llamk'ayta munani.
Such busy people.	Chayna ocupasqa runakuna.
That's great, actually.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
I can't answer that.	Chaytaqa manam kutichiyta atinichu.
No one could have stopped him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta atinmanchu karqan.
No time, no time, no time.	Mana pacha, mana pacha, mana pacha.
That is part of what happens.	Chayqa imapas pasasqanmanta hukninmi.
Bad month, actually.	Mana allin killa, chiqaptaqa.
I like that though.	Chayqa ichaqa gustanmi.
He said it should be easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi kananta nirqa.
You can’t answer those now.	Chaykunataqa manan kunanqa kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
Then he was angry.	Chaymantaqa phiñasqa kaq.
I can’t say no to him.	Manam paytaqa mana niyta atiymanchu.
Maybe twenty.	Ichapas iskay chunka.
They are no longer good.	Manañam allinchu kanku.
It was a very bad experience.	Llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
People are hungry, tired and scared.	Runakunaqa yarqasqa, sayk’usqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
This was not a playful character.	Kayqa manam pukllaq runachu karqa.
But it was a really good day.	Ichaqa cheqaq allin p’unchaymi karqan.
He was the next man.	Paymi qatiqnin runa kasqa.
I don’t really know what this is.	Manam allintachu yachani ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
He’s really thinking about it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaypi yuyaykushan.
You can be sure that is not the case now.	Chayqa kunan mana chayna kasqanmantam seguro kanki.
It’s not for you anymore.	Manañam qampaq.
Not sure what to make of this.	Mana segurochu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
Yes it was me.	Arí ñuqam karqani.
So do it early.	Chaymi temprano ruway.
As a scientist.	Yachaysapa hina.
He was very foolish.	Payqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
That meant a big man.	Chayqa hatun runa niyta munarqa.
With me, right now.	Ñoqawan, kunanpacha.
I thought that was great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
Happy afternoon to you.	Kusisqa tarde p'unchaw qampaq.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.	Arí, arí, imapas.
I didn’t really know what it was like.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imayna kasqanmantaqa.
He would be fine if he were.	Payqa allinmi kanman chayqa.
And eventually, yes.	Hinaspa qhepaman, arí.
He was just like me.	Payqa ñuqa hinam karqa.
It probably wasn’t.	Manapaschá karqachu.
He doesn’t always know.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu yachan.
He wasn’t always the happiest kid.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu aswan kusisqa wawa karqan.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Payqa manam chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
I was pretty good, he was better.	Ñuqaqa allin allinmi karqani, payqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Now he didn’t need another.	Kunanqa manañan hukta necesitarqanchu.
I don't think this will really do it.	Manam piensanichu kayqa chiqaptapuni ruwananta.
Yes, he lived there.	Arí, chaypi tiyaq.
Obviously something happened.	Sut’inmi imapas pasasqanmanta.
Once a week, maybe more, maybe less.	Semanapi huk kuti, ichapas aswan, ichapas aswan pisi.
They don’t really mean anything.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas niyta munanku.
But you probably know that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachanki.
I know I’m going to go here.	Yachanim kayman riyta.
And he smoked three cigarettes.	Hinaspa kimsa cigarrota pitaq.
I didn’t think he would be that kind of person.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna runa kananta.
I’ll do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chayta ruwasaq.
I want to play this again and again.	Kayta yapamanta yapamanta pukllayta munani.
He said he couldn’t find it.	Mana tariyta atisqayta nisqa.
All right, everybody.	Allinmi, llapa runa.
Take action now!.	¡Kunanpacha imatapas ruway!.
A world that’s never been the same.	Mana hayk’aqpas kaq pacha.
It doesn’t sound right.	Mana allinchu uyarikun.
I can’t deal with that.	Manam chaywanqa atipayta atiymanchu.
You go everywhere and everywhere.	Tukuy maymanpas maymanpas rinki.
And now, this.	Hinaspa kunan, kay.
I can’t do that to him.	Manam paytaqa chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
He wanted it so much.	Anchatam munarqa.
It does everything very quickly in a hurry.	Tukuy imatam ruwan ancha utqaylla utqaylla.
I wanted to talk about it.	Chayta rimayta munarqani.
Indeed, they were outnumbered.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa aswan askha karqanku.
I think he wasn’t happy.	Yuyaykuni mana kusisqachu kasqanmanta.
That was the best part though.	Chayqa aswan allin kaqmi karqan ichaqa.
She knew she would never be herself again.	Payqa yacharqanmi manaña hayk’aqpas pay kikin kananta.
This wasn’t like him.	Kayqa manan pay hinachu karqan.
He got in trouble a few times.	Iskay kimsa kutitam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
But does he seem tired?.	Ichaqa, ¿sayk’usqa hinachu kashan?.
He was always twice as smart as me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqamanta iskay kuti aswan yachaysapa karqa.
Yes, rather late.	Arí, aswan tarde.
But things are thoroughly wrong here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa allintan mana allinchu kashan.
Yes, he is right.	Arí, payqa allintam rimachkan.
He can’t believe what happened.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
That may not be the case for that.	Chaypaqqa manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
It was a great day for me.	Chay punchawqa hatun punchawmi karqa ñuqapaq.
This is serious!.	¡Kayqa serio!.
He never knew how to be alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu sapallan kayta.
Which is true for you.	Imataq chiqap qampaq.
He looks very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
But I want to know why.	Ichaqa imarayku chayna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
A while outside of this.	Huk rato hawapi kaymanta.
It’s probably easier this way.	Yaqapaschá kay hinaqa aswan facil kanman.
Uncertainty is the future.	Mana chiqap kaqmi hamuq pacha.
There was a child there.	Chaypin huk wawa kasqa.
Please tell me how to do it.	Ama hina kaspa, imaynatachus ruwanayta willaway.
But then he refused.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan munarqanchu.
But again, it wasn’t supposed to be that easy.	Ichaqa yapamanta, manan chay hina facilchu kanan karqan.
Obviously, you’re right.	Sut’inmi, allintan nirqanki.
I wonder what it is.	Tapukuni imataq kasqanmanta.
It wasn't going to be that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu kanan karqa.
You can't have them.	Manan chaykunataqa hap'iyta atiwaqchu.
That is what all of this is about.	Chaymantam tukuy kaykunaqa rimachkan.
This he soon received.	Kaytaqa pisi tiempollamantan chaskirqan.
He was me, I was.	Payqa ñuqam karqani.
They are here, somewhere.	Paykunaqa kaypim kachkanku, maypipas.
He is happy now.	Payqa kunanqa kusisqam kachkan.
But this is very simple.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha facilmi.
That happened this morning.	Chayqa kunan paqarinmi pasarqa.
That it wasn’t me.	Mana ñuqachu kasqayta.
That happened a few weeks ago.	Chayqa pasarqa iskay kimsa semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Not sure how it could be better.	Mana segurochu imayna aswan allin kanman.
It’s not the first time, you know.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu, yachanki.
All right, go with him.	Allinmi, paywan kuska riy.
A man, he says.	Huk runa, nispas nin.
Nothing like being at home.	Mana imapas wasipi kay hinaqa.
He didn’t want anything to go wrong.	Payqa manan imapas mana allinchu kananta munarqan.
He knew he wanted to play.	Payqa yacharqanmi pukllayta munasqanmanta.
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imarayku.
This is unfortunate, but important.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa ancha allinmi.
He was there alone with her all day.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi tukuy punchaw paywan karqa.
I wouldn’t do that to anyone.	Manam pitapas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
But there’s this interesting thing, this one thing.	Ichaqa kanmi kay sumaq kaq, kay huk kaq.
Everything was well hidden.	Tukuy imapas allin pakasqa kasqa.
He has been here for a very long time.	Payqa ancha unayñam kaypi kachkan.
Half an hour late.	Kuska hora tarde.
I really want to.	Chiqamanta munani.
And here he looks good.	Hinaspa kaypi payqa allinta rikchakun.
He probably didn’t do that.	Payqa manachá chaytachu ruwarqan.
He does that here.	Chaytaqa kaypim ruwan.
They were wrong, somehow.	Paykunaqa pantasqa karqanku, imaynatachus.
So it’s not easy.	Chaymi mana facilchu.
That seemed unlikely.	Chayqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
Unfortunately, it's not always that simple.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam sapa kutichu chayna facilchu.
But he kept doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
It looks like it will be very useful.	Ancha allin kananpaqmi rikchakun.
It will be a very interesting year.	Ancha sumaq wata kanqa.
Lots of things, maybe.	Achka imakuna, ichapas.
It couldn't have gone any better.	Manam aswan allinqa riyta atinmanchu karqa.
Unfortunately, this cost me the game.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa pukllayta qullqita quwarqa.
There are bad people out there.	Chaypim kan mana allin runakuna.
It could be in the near future.	Pisi tiempollamantan kanman.
I can't see her again.	Manañam hukmanta rikuyta atinichu.
He really had to do it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanan karqan.
Now they are great.	Kunanqa hatunmi kanku.
And that’s what he wanted to do.	Hinaspa chayta ruwayta munarqan.
The success will be remarkable.	Chay allin ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi kanqa.
That stuff isn’t right.	Chay imapas manam allinchu.
A few days, a week at the most.	Iskay kimsa punchaw, huk semana aswan achka.
Here at his home.	Kaypi wasinpi.
But if it does.	Ichaqa sichus chayta ruwan chayqa.
I’ve been worried all evening.	Tukuy chisi llakisqa kachkani.
It’s a short process.	Huk pisi ruwaymi.
No one can arrest him.	Manan pipas paytaqa hap'iyta atinmanchu.
Perhaps it happened for some reason.	Yaqapaschá imaraykupas chayna pasarqa.
So that was very important.	Chaymi chayqa ancha importante karqan.
But he seemed very comfortable and happy.	Ichaqa ancha allin hinaspa kusisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
I can’t sit here.	Manam kaypi tiyayta atiymanchu.
It caught him in the act.	Chay ruwaypi payta hap’irqan.
It will be better for you.	Aswan allinmi kanqa qampaq.
The first one is beautiful.	Ñawpaq kaqmi sumaq.
Two years passed.	Iskay wata pasarqa.
Man, he’s good.	Runa, pay allin.
Some of the best people in the world.	Kay pachapi wakin allin runakuna.
These people are.	Kay runakunaqa.
They are all human beings.	Llapallankum runakuna.
Is that really possible?.	¿Cheqaqchu chayqa kanman?.
I certainly lost sight of it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa manaña repararqanichu.
But he can’t think.	Ichaqa manan yuyaymanayta atinchu.
You are a schoolteacher.	Yachay wasipi yachachiqmi kanki.
They seemed to be good.	Paykunaqa allin kanman hinam karqaku.

I agree, it should be done properly.	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani, allinta ruwana.
I’m sick, sick, sick.	Unqusqa, unqusqa, unqusqa kani.
He’s still talking.	Payqa hinallam rimachkan.
Man all wrong.	Runa tukuy pantasqa.
And nothing else.	Hinaspa manaña imapas.
If something went wrong she didn't want him to be there.	Sichus imapas mana allinchu karqan chayqa manan munarqanchu pay chaypi kananta.
I actually like that one.	Chiqaptaqa chay hukninmi gustan.
I didn't think you could do that.	Manam piensarqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
It’s better than it is.	Aswan allin kasqanmanta.
That’s a terrible time.	Chayqa manchay tiempon.
It will be the day.	Chay punchawmi kanqa.
Some very nice ones.	Wakin ancha sumaq.
Two things, actually.	Iskay imapas, chiqaptaqa.
Fortunately, it’s easier.	Ancha kusisqa kayqa aswan facilmi.
Not the best, but not the worst.	Manan aswan allinchu, ichaqa manan aswan mana allinchu.
What is wrong with me?.	¿Imataq ñuqawan kachkan?.
And then he was terrified.	Hinaspa chaymanta mancharisqa kasqa.
Therein lies the truth.	Chaypin kashan cheqaq kaq.
It’s where it’s supposed to be.	Maypichus kanan chaypi kachkan.
It was never going to be that easy.	Manam haykapipas chayna facilchu kanan karqa.
I'm so sorry, but it's me.	Anchatam llakikuni, ichaqa ñuqam kani.
I do that all the time.	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon ruwani.
He’s not a bad guy, though.	Payqa manan millay runachu, ichaqa.
I tried to meditate for a week.	Huk semana yuyaymanayta munarqani.
What is the best way to do this.	Imataq aswan allin kayta ruwanapaq.
One of them actually does.	Hukninmi chiqaptapuni ruwan.
Maybe we should have done it once, maybe twice.	Ichapas huk kutita ruwanayku karqa, ichapas iskay kutita.
He loves to talk about it.	Payqa anchatam munan chaymanta rimayta.
That’s what he always says.	Chaynatam sapa kuti riman.
I mean somewhere.	Maypipas niyta munani.
Maybe yes, maybe not.	Ichapas arí, ichapas mana.
We need to do it more often.	Aswan achka kutitam ruwananchik.
A few people know why.	Iskay kimsa runakunam yachanku imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
And he’s actually pretty good.	Hinaspa payqa chiqaptaqa allin allinmi.
So it should make good money.	Chaymi allin qullqita ruwanan.
He lived alone in a mansion.	Payqa sapallanmi huk hatun wasipi tiyaq.
He thought he would never know.	Payqa mana hayk’aqpas yachananta yuyaykurqan.
This says it all.	Kaymi tukuyta nin.
We’re well placed.	Allinta churasqa kayku.
Everything that goes on there.	Tukuy chaypi puriq.
I couldn’t get home.	Manam wasiyman chayayta atirqanichu.
He’s been here long enough to know this.	Payqa unayñan kaypi kashan kayta yachananpaq.
He came every week.	Payqa sapa semanan hamurqan.
Now that is not true.	Kunanqa manan chayqa cheqaqchu.
And this was certainly the best.	Hinaspa kayqa cheqaqtapunin aswan allin karqan.
We did it again, everyone.	Yapamanta ruwarqayku, llapallanku.
This can't wait.	Kayqa manam suyayta atinchu.
I’m almost happy.	Yaqa kusisqam kachkani.
The man looked worried.	Chay runaqa llakisqa qhawarisqa.
I felt uncomfortable this morning.	Kunan paqarin mana allinchu tarikurqani.
I want to go for a walk.	Puriq riyta munani.
But that is not true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chay rimayqa.
He was really quick today.	Payqa chiqaptam kunan punchawqa utqaylla karqa.
He’s fine with that.	Payqa allinmi chaywanqa.
He obviously wasn’t happy at all.	Payqa sut’inmi mana imapipas kusisqachu kasqa.
This person says I was a bad kid.	Kay runaqa mana allin wawa kasqayta nin.
He doesn’t know what he wants.	Manam yachanchu ima munasqanmanta.
But what a set up.	Ichaqa ima churasqa.
But everything is good and bad.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi mana allinchu.
That's all there was today.	Chayllam kunan punchawqa karqa.
One day is another day.	Huk p'unchawqa huk p'unchawmi.
Take a walk around.	Huk puriyta ruway.
I just feel it.	Chayllam sientekuni.
Maybe that was for the best.	Ichapas chayqa allinpaq karqa.
Needless to say, he wasn't happy.	Manañam niyta munanichu mana kusisqachu kasqanmanta.
At least it shouldn’t be.	Aswanpas manan chay hinachu kanan.
He really can't go anywhere.	Chiqaptaqa manam maymanpas riyta atinmanchu.
I couldn’t ignore that.	Manam chaytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanichu.
I did, several times.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, achka kutita.
If that happens, it won't last long.	Chayna kaptinqa manam unaytachu kanqa.
It’s not worth it at all.	Manan imapipas valenchu.
Nothing could withstand them.	Manam imapas chaykunataqa aguantayta atirqachu.
I don’t really care for him.	Manam anchatachu paytaqa llakikuni.
You knew what to do with it.	Chaywan imata ruwanaykipaqmi yacharqanki.
Better than nothing right now.	Kunanpacha mana imamantapas aswan allinqa.
It didn't take long, it was surprisingly easy.	Mana unaytachu pasarqa, admirakuypaqmi facil karqa.
I still know almost nothing about it.	Kunankamapas yaqa mana imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu.
But it’s not like it is now.	Ichaqa manan kunan hinachu.
Yes, then.	Arí, chaymanta.
She didn't need him now.	Kunanqa manañan paytaqa necesitarqanchu.
I’ve seen it before.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi rikurqani.
But this is a very bad thing to do.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha mana allin ruwaymi.
It has not been a very good day so far.	Kunankamaqa manam ancha allin punchawchu karqa.
I was happy to be here.	Kusisqam karqani kaypi kasqaymanta.
No, but seriously.	Manan, ichaqa serio.
But things are better than they are now.	Ichaqa imapas aswan allinmi kunan imayna kasqanmantaqa.
There are new people in town.	Llaqtapiqa musuq runakunam kachkan.
She’s beautiful, actually.	Payqa sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
I was, at the time, anyway.	Ñuqaqa karqani, chay pacha, imayna kaptinpas.
But this is just me.	Ichaqa kayqa ñuqallam.
He wanted to, all along.	Payqa munarqanmi, tukuy tiempo.
Go to the city.	Llaqtaman riy.
I don't understand why.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to answer.	Manam kutichiyta munanichu.
He didn’t take it seriously.	Payqa manan allintachu qhawarirqan.
Maybe there’s an insurance policy.	Ichapas kanman huk seguro.
If this is serious, this person needs help.	Sichus kay hatun kanman chayqa, kay runaqa yanapayta necesitan.
Yes, it certainly is.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
What you can do about him.	Paymanta ruway atisqaykita.
There was no other word.	Manam huk rimayqa karqachu.
Maybe he should have gone.	Ichapas rinan karqa.
Being hungry is being human.	Yarqasqa kayqa runa kaymi.
Now he’s injured.	Kunanqa k’irisqa kashan.
You’re pretty sure it’s going to be the latter.	Yaqapaschá seguro kanki chay qhepa kaq kananmanta.
I mean, thank you.	Niyta munani, gracias.
If you’re willing to do a lot, then enjoy it.	Sichus munanki askha ruwayta, hinaqa kusisqa kay.
And there was some truth in that.	Hinaspa chaypiqa wakin cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Both were the best.	Iskayninkum aswan allin karqaku.
No one knew they were there together.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu kuska chaypi kasqankuta.
Now I’m sorry.	Kunanqa llakikuni.
It speaks all the way.	Tukuy ñanta riman.
This is extremely impressive.	Kayqa sinchi admirakuypaqmi.
More on this, please.	Astawan kaymanta, ama hina kaspa.
Yet he is still there.	Chayna kaptinpas payqa hinallam kachkan.
And then things are easier.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa imapas aswan facilmi.
Not a terribly popular feature.	Mana manchay riqsisqa ruwaychu.
Yeah, why not.	Arí, imaraykutaq mana.
It seems to be a serious mistake.	Sinchi pantasqa hinam kachkan.
One day he was there.	Huk punchawmi chaypi karqa.
But he can’t take the chance.	Ichaqa manan atinchu chay oportunidadta hap’iyta.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Manañan imananpaschu.
So this should go well.	Chaymi kayqa allinta rinan.
He agrees to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi arí nin.
How do I do this?.	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwasaq?.
He is present today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi kachkan.
He wasn’t always right.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu allinta rimaq.
But it wouldn’t be fast enough.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu kanman.
He knew something.	Payqa imatapas yacharqanmi.
That’s why he was there.	Chayraykum chaypi karqa.
He couldn’t overcome it.	Manam atipayta atirqachu.
He looked harder.	Aswan sinchita qhawarisqa.
Today is a very special day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha sumaq punchawmi.
He can’t answer.	Payqa manan kutichiyta atinmanchu.
This guy is one of them.	Kay runaqa hukninmi.
This, at least, was a success.	Kayqa, aswanpas, allinmi karqan.
It was a tough year.	Chayqa sinchi sinchi wata karqan.
That’s not difficult though.	Chayqa manan sasachu ichaqa.
There isn’t much time.	Mana ancha tiempo kanchu.
He sounds so easy.	Payqa ancha facilmi uyarikun.
I'd be fine.	Allinmi kayman.
I was a happy person.	Kusisqa runam karqani.
I enjoy everything about you.	Tukuy ima qanmanta kusikuni.
But he's not sure he can.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan atisqanmanta.
We did very well, you and me.	Ancha allintam ruwarqayku, qampas ñuqapas.
He can’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikuyta atinchu.
Not the worst thing in the world, he thinks.	Mana aswan mana allinchu kay pachapi, nispan yuyaykun.
He’s silly and playful.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi, pukllaqmi.
Everything was so amazing here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It looked very large.	Ancha hatunmi rikchakurqa.
But, what can you do.	Ichaqa, imatataq ruwawaq.
It makes it that much better.	Chayna aswan allintam ruwan.
If anything, he was happy.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, payqa kusisqan kasharqan.
And then it happened again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta pasarqa.
He was very much with her.	Payqa anchatam paywan kuska puriq.
Maybe not as much as before.	Ichapas mana ñawpaq hinachu.
If something seems wrong, it probably is.	Imapas mana allin hina kaptinqa yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
I was stupid, very stupid.	Ñuqaqa sonso karqani, ancha sonso.
I’m sure these must be somewhere.	Seguro kani kaykunaqa maypipas kananmanta.
Many, many more people.	Achka, achka aswan runakuna.
He thought it right.	Payqa allintan chayta yuyaykurqan.
But then he was never really a party guy.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu fiestapi kaq wayna karqan.
You know where that is.	Yachankim maypi chay kasqanmanta.
I wouldn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanmanchu.
He'll be back soon, he knows.	Chaylla kutimunanta, nispas yachan.
I really want to know what's wrong.	Chiqaptam yachayta munani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I wish I could stop talking.	Munaymanmi manaña rimayta.
I’m so furious.	Sinchi phiñasqa kashani.
Go make another one.	Riy hukta ruwanaykipaq.
They were as stupid as you.	Paykunaqa qan hina sonso karqanku.
I do a little bit.	Ñuqaqa huk chhikanta ruwani.
He looked better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi rikchakurqa.
But maybe this is too hard.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa llumpay sasa kanman.
They were strong, overwhelming people.	Sinchi llumpay runakunam karqaku.
And he was in despair.	Hinan payqa hukmanyasqa kasharqan.
It’s not the only thing about it.	Mana chayllachu chaymanta.
Everyone seems sick.	Lliwmi unqusqa hina.
This, however, does not seem to be the case.	Kayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
It can’t be fixed.	Mana allichayta atinchu.
I never had to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwanay karqachu.
But he wasn’t quite there.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaypi kasharqan.
But he says that’s not always the case.	Ichaqa nin manan sapa kutichu chhayna kasqanmanta.
Obviously it does .	Sut'inmi chaytaqa ruwan.
Two days later he did.	Iskay p’unchay qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqan.
Two days now like that.	Iskay punchaw kunan chayna.
I mean, it has to be.	Niyta munani, kanan tiyan.
I want to help with something.	Imapipas yanapayta munani.
I can well be this.	Allintam kayta atiyman.
But it just seems to be the case.	Ichaqa chayna kanan hinallam.
People get hurt all the time.	Sapa kutim runakunaqa k’irisqa kanku.
Yes, it was well placed.	Arí, allintam churasqa karqa.
Angry that I was sad.	Llakisqa kasqaymanta phiñasqa.
He was anything but good.	Payqa imapas karqan ichaqa allinmi karqan.
This thing does everything.	Kay imapas tukuy imatam ruwan.
I never knew there was such a problem.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Otherwise they’re just that.	Mana chayqa paykunaqa chaylla.
Everything was too easy.	Tukuy imapas llumpay facilmi karqa.
Something strange happened this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi imapas mana riqsisqa pasarqa.
So you don’t want to talk.	Chaymi mana rimayta munankichu.
That seems pretty crazy.	Chayqa ancha loco hinam.
Okay then anyway.	Allinmi chaymanta imayna kaptinpas.
And one last thing.	Hinaspa huk qhepa kaq.
That was a very difficult thing.	Chayqa llumpay sasam karqa.
He knew the way well.	Payqa allintam ñanta yacharqa.
I hope someone knows why.	Suyachkani pipas yachananta imanasqa kasqanmanta.
It felt quite familiar.	Allin riqsisqa hinam tarikurqa.
I thought you could do that.	Yuyarqanim chaytaqa ruwawaq.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy ima yachayta munarqa.
And that it was there.	Hinaspa chaypi kasqanmanta.
Hopefully, today wouldn't be that day.	Munaymanmi, kunan punchaw mana chay punchawchu kanman.
I'm still not quite sure about this.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu kaymanta seguro kani.
I can’t stop eating.	Manam mikhuyta saqiyta atiymanchu.
He really wanted to fix it.	Payqa anchatan chayta allichayta munarqan.
And he wanted to know.	Hinaspa yachayta munarqa.
That came a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan hamurqan.
No, you’re fine.	Manan, allinmi kashanki.
Tea and coffee in the morning.	Tutamanta chayta, kukata ima.
What smart people they are.	Ima yachaysapa runakunam kanku.
It probably depends on the circumstances.	Yaqapaschá imapas pasasqanmanta kanqa.
He’s too nice to do that.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi chay hinata ruwananpaq.
If he has one.	Sichus payqa hukta.
And if it’s not.	Hinaspa mana chayqa.
It’s sad what happened here.	Llakikuypaqmi kaypi pasasqanmanta.
And now that’s it.	Hinaspa kunanqa chaymi.
I don’t know exactly yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yachani.
The most common thing to do is to be a restaurateur.	Aswan ruwayqa huk mikhunata ruwaq kaymi.
If only he could get home.	Sichus wasinman chayayta atinman karqan chayqa.
I don’t want to be like that all the time.	Manam tukuy tiempo chayna kaytaqa munanichu.
One day it will be yours.	Huk punchawmi qampa kanqa.
And then, there you were.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chaypi karqanki.
And then he wasn't alone.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana sapallanchu karqa.
I don't feel good about this at all.	Kaymantaqa manam allintachu sientekuni ni imapipas.
Sounds like me.	Ñuqa hinam uyarikun.
They are yours now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi qanpa kanku.
So that would be true.	Chaymi chayqa cheqaq kanman.
You don’t know what it is.	Manam yachankichu ima kasqanmanta.
You’ll be there all week.	Tukuy semana chaypi kanki.
But they were just that.	Ichaqa chayllam karqaku.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allintachu karqa.
But it takes time.	Ichaqa tiempotan necesitan.
I could not fix this and make it better.	Kaytaqa manam allichayta atirqanichu hinaspa aswan allinta ruwayta atirqanichu.
So many things to do.	Ancha achka imakuna ruwanapaq.
And last night he knew something was wrong.	Hinaspa qayna tuta imapas mana allin kasqanmanta yacharqa.
Probably you, but it’s nice.	Yaqapaschá qan, ichaqa sumaqmi.
And this is yours.	Hinaspa kayqa qanpa.
Let me know if you want to see it.	Chayta qawayta munaspaqa willaway.
But it wouldn’t have been enough.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kanman karqan.
So I wanted to know.	Chaymi yachayta munarqani.
And it should be there.	Hinaspa chaypi kanan.
For goodness sake, this time.	Allinpaq, kay kutipi.
It’s rather absurd.	Aswan mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Be there for him.	Paypaq chaypi kay.
Surely he was to be a regular man.	Chiqamanta payqa sapa kuti runa kanan karqa.
He did well last night.	Qayna tutam allinta ruwarqa.
And I like that.	Hinaspa chayta gustan.
So it made the road not so lonely.	Chaymi ñanta mana chayna sapallan kananpaq ruwarqa.
He could never see her again.	Manañam haykapipas rikuyta atirqachu.
He spoke briefly.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan rimarqan.
That says it all.	Chayqa tukuy imatam nin.
Or late people.	Utaq tarde runakuna.
Not yet anyway,’ he says.	Manaraqmi imayna kaptinpas’, nispas nin.
No one could stop him.	Manan pipas hark’ayta atirqanchu.
I can’t ignore it.	Manam mana uyariyta atiymanchu.
But everyone is hungry.	Ichaqa llapa runan yarqasqa kashan.
I can’t imagine how you did it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imayna ruwasqaykita.
He drove for a while.	Payqa huk rato carropi rirqa.
I really didn’t want that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
And so it went on.	Hinaspa chaynatam rirqa.
For good this time.	Allinpaq kay kutipi.
Maybe the weather isn’t right.	Ichapas pacha mana allinchu.
Yes, that’s a long time ago.	Arí, chayqa unayñan.
If only that were the case.	Sichus chay hina kanman karqan chayqa.
Almost there now.	Yaqa chaypi kunan.
He certainly couldn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana atirqanchu.
It doesn’t need much.	Mana anchatachu necesitan.
Please let me know how you did it.	Ama hina kaspa willaway imayna ruwasqaykita.
That’s a really big deal.	Chayqa chiqap hatun ruwaymi.
He came to talk to me.	Payqa hamurqa ñuqawan rimananpaq.
But things have to stay the same.	Ichaqa imapas hinallam kanan.
He kept refusing.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi mana munarqanchu.
Maybe the man did the right thing.	Ichapas chay runaqa allinta ruwarqa.
He was in prison several times.	Achka kutim carcelpi karqa.
There will be no one there.	Chaypiqa manam pipas kanqachu.
Hopefully it will be very soon.	Munaymanmi ancha utqaylla kananta.
But obviously, man can do better.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, runaqa aswan allinta ruwayta atinman.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi.
He looked almost ridiculous.	Payqa yaqa asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
You’re the one.	Qamqa kanmi.
He doesn’t know it, but he certainly does.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yachanchu, ichaqa cheqaqtapunin yachan.
He could have been fired so quickly.	Chayna utqayllam qarqusqa kanman karqa.
No one wants to be unhappy or sad.	Manan pipas munanchu mana kusisqa kayta nitaq llakisqa kayta.
I mean, do what you gotta do.	Niyta munani, imatachus ruwanaykita ruway.
He was very hungry.	Payqa sinchi yarqasqa kasharqan.
He was a bit annoyed.	Payqa huk rato phiñasqa karqan.
I wanted to do better for him.	Paypaq aswan allinta ruwayta munarqani.
I can't drive without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam carrota manejayta atiymanchu.
He might not want to come.	Manapaschá hamuyta munanmanchu.
That’s a baby.	Chayqa wawa.
So maybe not.	Chaymi ichapas mana.
He sounds like a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runa hinam uyarikun.
But it seemed confusing, uncertain.	Ichaqa pantasqa hinam karqa, mana segurochu karqa.
Everything seems very safe and secure.	Tukuy imapas ancha seguro hinaspa seguro hinam kachkan.
I mean, really drunk.	Niyta munani, chiqap machasqa.
You know how some people are.	Yachanki imayna wakin runakuna kasqankuta.
This is where he was good.	Kaypim payqa allin karqa.
It happened three times today.	Kunan punchawmi kimsa kutita pasarqa.
It didn’t go well at all.	Manam allintachu rirqa ni imapipas.
Something else will come.	Huk imapas hamunqa.
Who, what, and why.	Pi, ima, imarayku ima.
If you want to join me, that would be fantastic.	Sichus ñuqawan kuska kayta munanki chayqa, chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
I'm sure someone will help.	Seguro kani pipas yanapananta.
These are actually quite interesting.	Kaykunaqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi.
That’s the beauty in it.	Chayqa chaypi kaq sumaq kaymi.
You knew better.	Aswan allintan yacharqanki.
And it speaks to a great many above.	Hinaspa riman huk hatun achka hawapi.
But now he knows what he wants.	Ichaqa kunanmi yachan ima munasqanmanta.
So, he knew it.	Chaymi, payqa yacharqa.
I'm seriously surprised.	Serio admirasqa kachkani.
He always did well.	Sapa kutim allinta ruwarqa.
It was left by the last occupant.	Chaytaqa qhipa tiyaq runam saqirqa.
I still felt happy.	Hinallam kusisqa tarikurqani.
Otherwise, it should be.	Mana chayqa, kanan tiyan.
That’s about as good as it gets.	Chayqa yaqa chayna allinmi chayman hina.
He knew now why he was here.	Payqa kunanmi yacharqa imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t find a good answer.	Manam allin kutichiyta tariyta atirqanichu.
But it’s nice to be around him.	Ichaqa sumaqmi paywan kuska kayqa.
Every hour, this is it.	Sapa hora, kaymi.
That is the secret to success.	Chayqa allinta ruwanapaq pakasqa kaqmi.
I don't know who's wrong here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi pikuna pantasqa kasqanmanta.
So there is no point in talking about it again.	Chaymi mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​hukmanta rimayqa.
There were no black people.	Manam yana runakunaqa karqachu.
Not really good, but better.	Mana chiqap allinchu, ichaqa aswan allin.
He didn't want to have a bad conversation with her.	Payqa manan paywan mana allin rimayta munarqanchu.
I just don’t know what to do anymore.	Chaylla manaña yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
It is new almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi musuq kachkan.
This was such a simple thing, it was funny.	Kayqa chayna facil kaqmi karqa, asikunapaq hinam karqa.
The hardest part is doing it.	Aswan sasa ruwayqa chayta ruwaymi.
I still want to buy something.	Hinallam imatapas rantiyta munani.
That's how they want to see the movie.	Chaynatam chay peliculata qawayta munanku.
I'm sure he's tired.	Seguro kani sayk'usqa kasqanmanta.
Sure, it’s a big deal.	Seguro, hatun ruwaymi.
And he began to speak.	Hinaspa rimayta qallaykurqa.
I haven’t found that yet.	Chaytaqa manaraqmi tarinichu.
I think about what it would be for me.	Yuyaykuni imachus ñuqapaq kanman chayta.
I never said it right there.	Manam haykapipas allintachu chaypiqa nirqani.
Something is wrong here, something is very, very wrong.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan, imapas ancha, ancha mana allinchu.
That sounds familiar.	Chayqa riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
Anyway, no big deal.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam hatun ruwaychu.
It’s not that easy.	Mana chayna chayllachu.
And worried about it.	Hinaspa chaymanta llakisqa.
I’m very good with that.	Chaywanqa ancha allinmi kani.
I wanted to know when.	Hayk’aqmi yachayta munarqani.
Both were immediately arrested.	Iskayninkum chaylla hapisqa karqaku.
He would be at home.	Payqa wasinpi kanman.
She refuses to have sex with him.	Payqa manan munanchu paywan puñuyta.
Like every day.	Sapa punchaw hina.
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqawan kachkarqa.
I would never be able to sleep.	Manam haykapipas puñuyta atiymanchu karqa.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu ruwasqanqa.
It was a more humane thing to do.	Chayqa aswan runa hina ruwaymi karqan.
Not like last year.	Mana qayna wata hinachu.
Wanted to ask about it, immediately.	Munarqa tapuyta chaymanta, chaylla.
He’s such a funny guy.	Payqa chhayna asikunapaq hina runan.
This happened, but it doesn't mean anything.	Kayqa pasarqa, ichaqa manam imapaqpas niyta munanchu.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.	Manam mana allinchu karqa, ichaqa manam allinchu karqa.
I would love to hear from you.	Anchatan munani qanmanta uyariyta.
If not this time, next time.	Mana kay kutipi kaptinqa, huk kutipi.
That he would do the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwananta.
It was like a day.	Huk punchaw hinam karqa.
Still the worst night ever.	Kunankamapas aswan mana allin tutam.
You learn every day.	Sapa punchawmi yachanki.
At least less.	Aswanpas aswan pisi.
It's there anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas chaypim kachkan.
He may not be able to walk away from the problem.	Manapaschá chay sasachakuymanta puriyta atinchu.
He just has to do it.	Payqa chayllaraqmi ruwanan.
That's what he knew he could do.	Chaynatam yacharqa ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Not anymore, he said.	Manañam, nispa.
He still wasn't sure how he felt.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasqa imayna sientekusqanmanta.
No big difference there.	Mana hatun chikan kay chaypi.
Nothing ever seemed to work.	Manam imapas haykapipas allinpaq hinachu karqa.
This guy can’t win.	Kay runaqa manam atipayta atinchu.
Strong, strong, strong.	Sinchi, sinchi, sinchi.
I heard that a lot.	Chaytaqa anchatam uyarirqani.
Yeah, that’s him.	Arí, chaymi pay.
He was the greatest that ever did it.	Payqa aswan hatunmi chayta ruwaq.
He needs that.	Payqa chaytan necesitan.
If so, then .	Chayna kaptinqa, chaymanta .
In fact, it's not like him at all.	Chiqaptaqa manam pay hinachu ni imapipas.
They are very intelligent people.	Ancha yachaysapa runakunam kan.
But she is a good girl.	Ichaqa allin sipasmi.
He glanced at the door in horror again.	Hukmanta mancharisqa punkuta qhawarisqa.
This is what I mean.	Kaymi niyta munani.
It has to be done together.	Kuska ruwana tiyan.
He looks really good now.	Payqa kunanqa chiqap allinmi rikchakun.
I can never, you know.	Manam haykapipas atiymanchu, yachanki.
He died in hospital a month later.	Huk killa qhepamanmi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
Clearly he wasn’t happy.	Sut’inmi mana kusisqachu kasharqan.
At the time, no one thought they were good enough.	Chay tiempopiqa manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu allin kasqankuta.
How to do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwana.
I still can't understand it.	Kunankamapas manam entiendeyta atinichu.
Nothing else.	Mana imapas huk.
There is truth in that.	Chaypiqa kanmi cheqaq kaq.
You can't do anything now.	Kunanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Preferably someone better than you.	Aswan allinqa qanmanta aswan allin runa.
It would be that simple.	Chayna facilmi kanman.
That’s just where it’s at.	Chayqa maypichus kachkan chaylla.
It will be very good for me.	Ancha allinmi kanqa ñuqapaq.
That’s why this is so important.	Chayraykum kayqa ancha allin.
They will be good.	Paykunaqa allinmi kanqa.
But he knew it would be bad.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana allin kananta.
And a lot of people, they were there.	Hinaspa achka runakuna, chaypi karqaku.
His subsequent actions with it are irrelevant.	Chaywan qhepaman ruwasqanqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
This was going to be ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinam kachkarqa.
It’s good but that’s all.	Allinmi ichaqa chayllam.
That doesn’t mean it’s great, though.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu ancha allin kasqanmanta, ichaqa.
Of course, better is better.	Arí, aswan allinqa aswan allinmi.
I won’t be able to go there.	Manam chayman riyta atisaqchu.
This means a lot.	Kayqa anchatam niyta munan.
I was in a good mood.	Ñuqaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
He’s angry, frustrated, hurt.	Payqa phiñasqa, hukmanyasqa, k’irisqa.
Then to the school.	Chaymanta yachay wasiman.
I still want to work.	Hinallam llamkayta munani.
From this they were well hidden.	Kaymantaqa allintam pakasqa karqaku.
This is a whole process.	Kayqa tukuy ima ruwaymi.
Glad to be outside.	Kusisqa hawapi kasqanmanta.
It’s not quite hard enough.	Manam allintachu sinchita.
It just meant what it said, nothing else.	Chayqa nisqanman hinallam niyta munarqa, manam imatapas.
I have always tried many times.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim achka kutita kallpanchakurqani.
He knew so much.	Chayna achkatam payqa yacharqa.
I just didn’t want him to be here.	Chaylla mana munarqanichu kaypi kananta.
This is not always the case.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu chayna.
That would be absurd.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Not too bad but not too good.	Mana ancha mana allinchu ichaqa mana ancha allinchu.
The people were very angry.	Runakunaqa sinchita phiñasqa karqanku.
I want to fix that.	Chayta allichayta munani.
He was the one who was disappointed.	Paymi hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
Again, kind of sad.	Yapamanta, imayna llakisqa.
You don’t seem to want to tell me.	Manas willayta munawaqchu hina.
And like you.	Hinaspa qan hina.
Whatever you can do.	Imapas atisqaykita.
I think we’ve done well.	Allinta ruwasqaykumanta yuyaykuni.
I want him here if not.	Payta kaypi munani sichus mana chayqa.
Well, it’s not.	Allinmi mana.
But it didn’t last that long.	Ichaqa manan chay unaytachu karqan.
I want to say everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata niyta munani.
That wouldn’t do anyone any good.	Chayqa manan pitapas allintachu ruwanman.
What to do with it.	Imakuna ruwanapaq.
It was actually quite sad.	Chiqaptaqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Where as you are not.	Maypi hina mana kanki.
I mean, he’s amazing.	Niyta munani, payqa admirakuypaqmi.
She’s a tough girl.	Payqa sinchi sipasmi.
And then year, then year.	Hinaspa chaymanta wata, chaymanta wata.
It just won’t happen.	Chaylla mana kanqachu.
Here is where they are now.	Kaypi kunan maypi kachkanku.
I’m a bad boy.	Mana allin wayna kashani.
I thought it was more like ten.	Aswan chunka hina kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
He had an idea of ​​how he was going to do it.	Payqa huk yuyayniyuqmi karqan imayna ruwananmanta.
They know that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yachanku.
I am not good enough for you now.	Kunanqa manam qampaq allinchu kani.
Mary was a real person.	Mariaqa chiqap runam karqa.
I’m not sure, you know, what he really does.	Manam segurochu kani, yachanki, chiqaptapuni ima ruwasqanmanta.
He wants to play it.	Payqa chayta tocayta munan.
He was probably there that night.	Yaqapaschá chay tuta chaypi kachkarqa.
It was ten years ago.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chay tiempo karqan.
Almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi.
That makes me feel insecure.	Chaywanmi mana segurochu sientekuni.
A really, really good guy.	Chiqap, chiqap allin runa.
Yes, he had to do this.	Arí, payqa kaytan ruwanan karqan.
That means an outlet every time.	Chayqa niyta munan sapa kuti huk lluqsiyta.
So maybe next time.	Chaymi ichapas hamuq kutipi.
He knew exactly who he was.	Payqa allintam yacharqa pi kasqanmanta.
Anything else may not.	Huk imapas manapaschá.
Perhaps at school.	Yaqapaschá escuelapi.
But they are so wrong.	Ichaqa chhayna pantasqa kashanku.
He was always hungry.	Payqa sapa kutim yarqaymanta kachkarqa.
I think she is beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi nispam yuyani.
He was a little crazy.	Payqa huk chhikanta loco kasqa.
So, you never know.	Chaymi, mana haykapipas yachankichu.
It began to make sense.	Chayqa allinta entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
Yes they are very nice.	Arí ancha sumaqmi kanku.
I can’t remember everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas yuyariyta atinichu.
I need that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi necesitasaq.
This is not always true.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu chiqap.
I know this is something special for you.	Yachanim kayqa qampaq imapas ancha allin kasqanmanta.
This is very important for food safety.	Kayqa ancha allinmi mikhuy allin kananpaq.
No, he couldn’t do this.	Manan, manan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He wasn’t as sure as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu seguro kasharqan.
And then do it again.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta ruway.
But the result was obvious.	Ichaqa chay ruwasqanqa sut’inmi karqan.
This one, however, gets a little tricky.	Kaymi ichaqa huk chhikanta sasachakuypi tarikun.
I will never be an adult.	Manam haykapipas hatun runachu kasaq.
So they are as good as ever.	Chaymi paykunaqa ñawpaq hina allin kanku.
It wasn’t as popular as the first season.	Chayqa mana ñawpaq kaq pacha hinachu ancha allin qhawarisqa karqan.
He told me to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
So now, go ahead.	Chaymi kunan, riy.
You have to do everything on your own.	Tukuy imatam sapallayki ruwanayki.
We did that here.	Chaytaqa kaypim ruwarqayku.
He’s the one who lives here.	Paymi kaypi tiyaq.
One day I will make another one.	Huk punchawmi hukta ruwasaq.
Unfortunately it happened last year.	Llakikuypaqmi qayna wata pasarqa.
People always wanted to hear about it.	Runakunaqa sapa kutim chaymanta uyariyta munarqa.
He did the right thing the whole time.	Payqa tukuy chay tiempotan allinta ruwarqan.
Now he is not sure.	Kunanqa manañam segurochu kachkan.
Just not quite this second.	Chaylla mana allintachu kay iskay kaq.
There is a wonderful time.	Chaypin kashan sumaq tiempo.
Someone older than me.	Pipas ñuqamanta kuraq kaq.
Say the second is not true.	Iskay kaq mana chiqap kasqanmanta niy.
The man has been through so much.	Chay runaqa ancha achkatam pasarqa.
I’m going at the end of next month.	Hamuq killa tukukuypi risaq.
He doesn't know what to do.	Mana yachanchu ima ruwananta.
What do you want to do here.	Imatataq kaypi ruwayta munanki.
He is in the forefront.	Payqa ñawpaqpi kachkan.
We are all proud of you.	Llapanchismi orgulloso kayku qanmanta.
Actually, he's still not so sure about it.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa manaraqmi chaymantaqa chayna segurochu kachkan.
One of them plays baseball.	Hukninmi béisbol pukllaq.
I don’t know how to talk to him.	Manam yachanichu paywan rimayta.
Perhaps he should have done it immediately.	Yaqapaschá chaylla ruwanan karqa.
He probably didn't care.	Manapaschá payqa imananpaschu karqan.
That, he couldn’t do.	Chaytaqa, manam ruwayta atirqachu.
No one thought it would be easy.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu chay ruway facil kananta.
He did get a ride.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin huk carrota hap’irqan.
He looked like a foolish young man.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuq wayna hinam rikchakurqa.
And this is what we did.	Hinaspa kayta ruwarqayku.
But he is not such a person.	Ichaqa manan chhayna runachu.
But it was rather unreal.	Ichaqa aswan mana cheqaqchu karqan.
He doesn’t sound crazy.	Payqa manan loco hinachu uyarikun.
The person who doesn’t do the job.	Chay llamkayta mana ruwaq runa.
This wasn't very safe.	Kayqa mana ancha segurochu karqa.
Here,’ he says.	Kaypi,’ nispas nin.
All very sad.	Tukuy ancha llakisqa.
But he’d been hurt before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi k’irisqa kasqa.
I really don't know what to say.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu ima niyta.
And this was it.	Hinaspa kaymi karqan.
I didn’t know how to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta yacharqanichu.
It worked out for about two years.	Yaqa iskay wata allintam lluqsirqa.
It’s actually a process.	Chiqaptaqa huk ruwaymi.
But that was two years ago.	Ichaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chayqa karqan.
If you want out, go for it.	Sichus lluqsiyta munanki chayqa, riy.
It’s a terrible thing to do.	Manchay ruwaymi.
However, there are no people anywhere.	Ichaqa, manan maypipas runakunaqa kanchu.
And anyway, it's like home.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas, wasi hinam.
It was hard, very hard.	Sinchi karqan, ancha sinchi.
I thought he would agree with me.	Yuyarqanim ñuqawan acuerdopi kananta.
I've always done them that way.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim chaynata ruwarqani.
Almost a reality.	Yaqa huk chiqap kaq.
Nothing was easy.	Manan imapas facilchu karqan.
It’s a sad thing that happened.	Llakikuypaqmi imapas pasasqanmanta.
Now, all alone, again.	Kunanqa, llapan sapallan, yapamanta.
He didn’t look right now.	Kunanqa mana allintachu qhawarisqa.
Maybe you can do exactly what you want.	Ichapas allinta ruwawaq munasqaykita.
I’m so happy to be here.	Ancha kusisqa kani kaypi kasqaymanta.
I can't wait to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa manam suyayta atiymanchu.
Don’t you want to be this.	Manachu kayta munanki.
He’s not alone, of course.	Mana pay sapallanchu, chiqamanta.
What he said about it.	Ima nisqanmanta.
It’s rather sad actually.	Aswan llakikuypaqmi chiqaptaqa.
That’s a beautiful girl.	Chayqa sumaq sipasmi.
I know what that thing is.	Yachanim ima chay imapas kasqanmanta.
There is nothing there.	Chaypiqa manam kanchu.
They may or may not.	Paykunaqa ichapas manapaschá.
I am a teacher.	Ñuqaqa yachachiqmi kani.
Everyone is in the world.	Lliwmi kay pachapi kachkanku.
Maybe it’s ambiguous.	Ichapas iskay yuyayniyuq kanman.
That you are the same.	Chay kikin kasqaykita.
You knew a though was coming.	Yacharqanki huk ichaqa hamunanta.
But he couldn’t bear to be alone.	Ichaqa manan aguantayta atirqanchu sapallan kayta.
But I think you are amazing.	Ichaqa admirakuypaqmi kasqaykita piensani.
I mean, seriously, it would be better.	Niyta munani, serio, aswan allinmi kanman.
And here they are now.	Hinaspa kaypi kunan kachkanku.
We're pretty safe here.	Kaypiqa allin segurom kachkaniku.
He was the one who did the talking.	Paymi rimayta ruwaq.
Great black man.	Hatun yana runa.
And it was just, like, really fucking bad.	Hinaspa chaylla karqa, hina, chiqap millay millay.
I couldn't remember what they looked like.	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu imayna rikchayniyuq kasqankuta.
I feel ugly and sad.	Millay, llakisqa sientekuni.
I thought it might be too much for you.	Yuyarqanim ichapas qampaq llumpay kanman nispa.
I can get on with it.	Chaywanmi puriyta atiyman.
I doubt it's anything new, unfortunately.	Iskayrayani imapas musuq kasqanmanta, llakikuypaqmi.
It was a bad, bad thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin, mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
He wanted to be sober.	Payqa allin yuyayniyuq kaytam munarqan.
They were indeed great.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa hatun karqanku.
In fact, it can be severely detrimental.	Aswanpas sinchitan mana allintachu ruwanman.
Nothing more, nothing less .	Mana imapas aswan, mana imapas pisi .
About half as fast.	Yaqa kuskan utqaylla.
I still haven't been able to find a job.	Kunankamapas manam llamkayta tariyta atirqanichu.
Again, almost too easy.	Yapamanta, yaqa ancha facil.
He doesn’t know anything.	Payqa manam imatapas yachanchu.
I knew it was a good thing.	Allintam yacharqani.
I was so excited.	Chayna kusisqam karqani.
He was always wrong.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi mana allintachu yuyaykurqan.
I always wanted him.	Paytaqa sapa kutim munarqani.
I was him too, alone.	Ñuqapas paymi karqani, sapallay.
Do it for him.	Paypaq ruway.
There are a lot of them.	Chaypiqa kanmi achka.
It’s okay to be angry.	Allinmi phiñasqa kayqa.
He is doing the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwachkan.
Some good, some bad.	Wakin allin, wakin mana allin.
It may or may not be true.	Cheqaq kaqmi kanman manapaschá.
But that’s what you do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanki.
I am all this.	Tukuy kaymi kani.
But they were always very angry.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi sinchita phiñasqa karqanku.
This is one of the main things we do.	Kaymi huknin hatun ruwasqaykumanta.
Obviously it doesn’t do well.	Sut’inmi mana allintachu ruwan.
It would be better, that is.	Aswan allinmi kanman, chaymi.
I'm going to be very busy today, not going anywhere.	Kunan punchawmi ancha ocupasqa kasaq, manam maymanpas risaqchu.
I was the people.	Ñuqam runakuna karqani.
But, but, but .	Ichaqa, ichaqa, ichaqa .
She told me she did.	Payqa niwarqanmi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
No, it's better tomorrow.	Manan, aswan allinqa paqarin p'unchaymi.
He could say nothing more.	Payqa manañan imatapas astawan niyta atirqanchu.
Please be nicer.	Ama hina kaspa, aswan sumaq kay.
There are half a dozen of them.	Chaypin kuskan chunka kanku.
They don’t care what it looks like.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Anyone can do this, anyone.	Pipas kayta ruwayta atinman, pipas.
But I can’t sing any other way.	Ichaqa manan huk hinata takiyta atiymanchu.
It’s not a big deal, he said.	Manam hatun ruwaychu, nispas nin.
He was a happy, nice, nice guy.	Payqa kusisqa, sumaq, sumaq runam karqa.
She decided to move in with him.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi paywan tiyaq riyta.
No one is born a smoker.	Manan pipas cigarrota pitaq hinachu paqarin.
That’s a mistake.	Chayta pantasqa.
I have to be in the front.	Ñawpaqpi kanay tiyan.
It would have been nice.	Allinmi kanman karqa.
I don't want to see that again.	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta qawayta munanichu.
And then this whole thing.	Hinaspa chaymanta kay tukuy ima.
He may never want to leave.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas ripuyta munanmanchu.
I think maybe he’s right.	Yuyaykuni ichapas payqa allinta rimachkan.
It was so nice to be alone.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa sapallay kayqa.
But it’s useful for something like this.	Ichaqa kay hina imapaqpas allinmi.
This is all interesting.	Kayqa tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Everyone is eager for the next game.	Lliwmi anchata munanku qatiqnin pukllayta.
He was nervous and scared, he said.	Payqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima kasqa, nispa.
He seemed as sane as I was.	Payqa ñuqa hina allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
You can’t understand it.	Mana entiendeyta atiwaqchu.
About half a dozen.	Yaqa kuskan chunka.
You are probably doing a great job.	Yaqapaschá hatun llamkayta ruwachkanki.
Before that, more.	Manaraq chaymanta, astawan.
It was probably the worst.	Yaqapaschá aswan mana allinqa karqan.
I am not as good as that man.	Manam chay runa hinachu allin ruwaq kani.
We are very happy about that.	Ancha kusisqam kanchik chaymanta.
But not at all.	Ichaqa manan imapipas.
But it's still pretty funny.	Ichaqa hinallam ancha asikunapaq hina.
In fact, the man is beautiful.	Chiqaptaqa, chay runaqa sumaqmi.
I know why you did it.	Yachanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqaykita.
He wasn’t a nobody.	Payqa mana pipas kasqa.
There is such a thing as	Chay hinaqa kanmi .
Here are two things you can do that you want.	Kaypi iskay ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq kachkan munasqaykita.
But he says he’s not going anywhere.	Ichaqa ninmi mana maymanpas rinanpaq.
He had no idea who it was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu pichus chay runa kasqanmanta.
Can't afford one right now.	Mana kunanpacha hukta rantiyta atinchu.
He seemed quite rich.	Payqa allin qhapaq hinam karqa.
He wouldn’t be difficult.	Payqa manan sasachu kanman.
I am a morning person, yes.	Paqarin runam kani, arí.
Now, finish quickly.	Kunanqa, usqhaylla tukuy.
It could be less, it could be more.	Aswan pisi kanman, aswan achka kanman.
They are great people.	Paykunaqa hatun runakunam.
It’s better than what it is.	Aswan allinmi ima kasqanmantaqa.
We’re that much smarter.	Chayna aswan yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I can’t do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
He was sure it was one.	Payqa segurom karqa huknin kasqanmanta.
Didn't really leave him.	Mana chiqaptachu payta saqirqa.
But they weren’t good enough.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqanku.
He noticed the feeling.	Payqa repararqanmi chay sientekusqanmanta.
Yes, there will be time.	Arí, tiempon kanqa.
He would be alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kanman.
Maybe he’s human.	Ichapas payqa runa.
Wealth is not a bad thing.	Qhapaq kayqa manan mana allinchu.
He's tired all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon sayk'usqa kashan.
It's already a bit there.	Ñam huk chikan chaypi kachkan.
People want that.	Runakuna chayta munanku.
And the second time around.	Hinaspa iskay kaq kutipi.
He doesn’t know why now.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku kunanqa.
He is no longer there.	Payqa manañam kanchu.
First, he refuses to do so.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan munanchu chayta ruwayta.
he wanted to know.	nispas yachayta munarqa.
It really didn’t mean much to me.	Chiqamanta mana anchatachu ñuqapaq niyta munarqani.
I want this here.	Kayta kaypi munani.
Anything he says would be wrong.	Imapas nisqanqa mana allinchu kanman.
Maybe a month.	Ichapas huk killa.
I want to be out there.	Chay hawapi kaytam munani.
It’s better here.	Kaypiqa aswan allinmi.
They were out there, doing something.	Paykunaqa hawapi karqanku, imatapas ruwaspa.
I think it means two things.	Yuyaykuni iskay ima niyta munan.
He’s got two cups of coffee.	Iskay kukata hap’isqa.
I've got his name.	Sutinta hap'ini.
Smart, that kid.	Yachaysapa, chay wawa.
I know you are happy.	Yachanim kusisqa kasqaykita.
I think this often, very often.	Kayta sapa kuti, ancha sapa kuti yuyani.
And there’s something there.	Hinaspa chaypiqa imapas kanmi.
One person again.	Huk runa yapamanta.
So he has to do it again.	Chaymi hukmanta ruwanan.
It was always good.	Sapa kutim allin karqa.
It would be another thing to do.	Huk ruwaymi kanman.
You're not really cold.	Manam chiqaptachu chiri kanki.
I really wanted to help.	Anchatam yanapayta munarqani.
You could party all summer long.	Tukuy verano fiestata ruwawaq.
He's that quick.	Payqa chayna utqayllam.
Unfortunately, maybe not.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichapas mana.
He is here though.	Payqa kaypim kachkan ichaqa.
It’s a sad night.	Llakisqa tutan.
From what he did.	Ruwasqanmanta.
This didn’t make sense.	Kayqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqan.
But that argument was mostly wrong.	Ichaqa chay rimayqa yaqa llapanpim pantasqa karqa.
I act like a fool.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam ruwani.
And that’s amazing.	Hinaspa chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
I felt a little excited.	Huk chhikanta kusisqa tarikurqani.
There are two people there.	Chaypiqa iskay runam kachkan.
Not the guy.	Mana chay runachu.
He knew he had to go.	Payqa yacharqanmi rinan kasqanmanta.
He couldn’t find another car.	Payqa manan huk carrota tariyta atirqanchu.
That's what you do.	Chayqa imatam ruwanki.
That’s the only thing I’m really worried about.	Chayllam anchata llakikuni.
And doing well at that.	Hinaspa allinta ruwaspa chaypi.
He said he didn’t want to see her again.	Nirqanmi manaña hukmanta rikuyta munasqanmanta.
However, this is absurd.	Ichaqa, kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi.
But you did amazingly well.	Ichaqa admirakuypaqmi allinta ruwarqanki.
He was really good at it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi allin karqa.
He's not there to buy it.	Payqa manan chaypichu chayta rantinanpaq.
He should be fired tonight.	Kunan tutam qarqusqa kanan.
He was always there in the past.	Payqa ñawpaq tiempopiqa sapa kutillanmi karqan.
That would do it, sure.	Chayqa ruwanman, seguro.
I thought that was true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani.
If you’re someone else, probably not.	Sichus huk runa kanki chayqa, yaqapaschá mana.
And then the summer.	Hinaspa chaymanta chiri killa.
Often.	Yaqa sapa kuti.
There’s the chance.	Chaypin kashan chansa.
But then everything went wrong.	Ichaqa chaymantam tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
It just can’t get any better than this.	Chaylla mana kaymanta aswan allintachu tariyta atin.
What happened was tragic.	Imapas pasarqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
But he knew he couldn't handle it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta mana aguantayta atisqanmanta.
But don’t do this unless you have a reason to.	Ichaqa ama kayta ruwaychu manachus imaraykupas chayta ruwanaykipaq.
They were both hungry.	Iskayninkum yarqasqa karqaku.
That was no longer a good thing.	Chayqa manañam allinchu karqa.
Soon you will be there.	Pisi tiempollamantan chaypi kanki.
Still not sure.	Hinallam mana segurochu.
I'm having a party tonight.	Kunan tutam fiestata ruwachkani.
Everything seemed fine again.	Tukuy imapas yapamanta allinmi rikchakurqa.
It would be crazy.	Loco kaymi kanman.
Make it strong.	Sinchita ruway.
He did not stay idle for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu mana imatapas ruwaspa qhepakurqan.
He noticed their characteristics.	Payqa repararqanmi imayna kasqankuta.
Why both of them.	¿Imanasqataq iskayninku.
You are really sick.	Chiqamanta unqusqa kachkanki.
Weather is bad.	Tiempo mana allin.
Yeah, that’s me.	Arí, chaymi ñuqa kani.
Better chance.	Aswan allin chansa.
I’ve been there a lot.	Achkatam chaypi karqani.
He had a really good idea about this.	Payqa kaymanta chiqap allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
And he would do that.	Hinaspa payqa chayta ruwanman.
But no one knows exactly what happened.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan imachus pasasqanmanta.
And how he left and why he left.	Hinaspa imaynatas ripurqan, imaraykutaq ripurqan chayta.
Unfortunately, there is not much we can do about it.	Llakikuypaqmi, chaymantaqa manam anchatachu ruwananchik.
Sorry if it's early.	Pampachaykuway temprano kaptinqa.
And then how he meant it.	Hinaspa chaymanta imaynatataq niyta munasqanmanta.
It’s not good for me.	Mana allinchu ñuqapaq.
It was the best thing ever.	Chay tiempopiqa aswan allin kaqmi karqa.
He will do well there.	Chaypiqa allintam ruwanqa.
Someone could be out here.	Pipas kay hawapi kanman.
I felt comfortable here.	Kaypiqa allintam tarikurqani.
I’m all about this stuff.	Ñuqaqa tukuy kay imamanta kani.
Something about him is wrong.	Paymanta imapas mana allinchu.
They are obviously better than him.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi paymanta aswan allin kasqankuta.
You still can’t.	Kunankamapas manam atiwaqchu.
He just looked like a regular person.	Sapa kuti runa hinallam rikchakurqa.
Would that be too difficult?.	¿Chayqa ancha sasachu kanman?.
Man, that’s amazing.	Runa, chayqa admirakuypaqmi.
Now go, go.	Kunan riy, riy.
But he disagrees.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu kashan.
I didn’t want to know anything about him.	Manam paymanta imatapas yachayta munarqanichu.
Which is here anyway.	Imataq kaypi kachkan imayna kaptinpas.
He knew he wasn’t a good teacher.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin yachachiq kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t speak yet.	Manaraqmi rimayta atirqanichu.
Maybe that’s all though.	Ichapas chaylla ichaqa.
But that’s what they know how to do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwayta yachanku.
He’s very good like that.	Payqa ancha allinmi chayna.
You have to do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwanayki tiyan.
I wanted to hear that.	Chayta uyariyta munarqani.
Anyone have an idea of ​​what can go wrong.	Pipas huk yuyayniyuqmi imakuna mana allinchu kanman.
I am still looking for him.	Paytaqa kunankamapas maskachkani.
Say something else.	Huk imatapas niy.
Do something unreasonable.	Mana yuyayniyuq ima ruway.
It won’t go the way it wants to.	Manam munasqanman hinachu rinqa.
He was nowhere or nothing.	Payqa manan maypipas nitaq imapas karqanchu.
About twenty people were there.	Yaqa iskay chunka runakunam chaypi karqaku.
If he had to do it.	Sichus pay ruwanan karqan chayqa.
And that’s really nice.	Hinaspa chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
It’s not a good thing to do though.	Mana allin ruwaychu ichaqa.
He was a wonderful teacher.	Payqa ancha sumaq yachachiqmi karqa.
So, be strong.	Chaymi, sinchita kay.
No reason not to immediately.	Mana imaraykupas mana chaylla kananpaq.
But he couldn’t turn back time.	Ichaqa manan tiempota qhepaman kutichiyta atirqanchu.
I couldn’t tell either.	Ñuqapas manam willayta atirqanichu.
He hadn’t agreed.	Payqa manan acuerdopichu kasqa.
He could not dwell in the past.	Payqa manan ñawpaq tiempopi tiyayta atirqanchu.
You know who you want to talk to.	Yachankim piwan rimayta munasqaykita.
He doesn’t know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yachanchu.
It can’t be safe, and .	Manam segurochu kanman, hinaspa .
Of course, he couldn't say that.	Arí, manam chaytaqa niyta atirqachu.
So, that’s okay.	Chaymi, chaymi allinta.
He wanted to be where the weather was good.	Maypichus allin tiempo karqan chaypiqa kaytan munarqan.
You are mentally reckless.	Yuyayniykipiqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
This is not possible.	Kaytaqa manam atichwanchu.
The latter unless otherwise specified.	Qhipa kaq mana huk nisqa kaptinqa.
You're not really going to get hurt.	Manam chiqaptachu k'irisqa kanki.
Then, tell me .	Chaymanta, willaway .
Otherwise a .	Mana chayqa huk .
He had just made a mistake.	Payqa chayraqmi pantasqa.
I was always alone.	Sapa kutim sapallay karqani.
This is what this is all about.	Kaymi kayqa tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
He knew he couldn’t do it there.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chaypi ruway atisqanmanta.
That’s pretty big for me right now.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi ñuqapaq kunanpacha.
He was a new man.	Payqa musuq runam karqa.
I think that’s too much.	Ñuqaqa chayta llumpayta yuyani.
And you do stuff.	Hinaspa qamqa imakunatapas ruwanki.
He probably didn't want that.	Payqa manapaschá chaytaqa munarqanchu.
I hope always.	Suyachkani sapa kuti.
You can never take it too hard.	Manam haykapipas sinchita hapiyta atiwaqchu.
In fact, he spoke a little too early.	Aswanpas huk chhikantan nishuta temprano rimarqan.
I can’t fix him.	Manam paytaqa allichayta atiymanchu.
The process, however, is pointless.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
We're tired and busy.	Sayk'usqa, ocupasqa ima kayku.
Yes, it probably was.	Arí, yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
And that he couldn’t do that.	Hinaspa chayta mana ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Where did you do it.	Maypitaq ruwarqanki.
I’ve seen it often before.	Ñawpaqtaqa sapa kutillanmi rikurqani.
But for some reason.	Ichaqa imaraykupas.
It is indeed the truth.	Cheqaqtapunin cheqaq kaq.
I wish something would happen.	Munaymanmi imapas pasananta.
If it isn’t, it doesn’t.	Mana kaptinqa manam ruwanchu.
Just not, you know, really happy.	Chaylla mana, yachanki, chiqap kusisqa.
But he knew what he was thinking.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
Yeah, that’s easy.	Arí, chayqa facilmi.
I really didn’t want to think about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
Yes, thank you, thank you.	Arí, gracias, gracias.
And, you know, it’s hard.	Hinaspa, yachanki, sasa.
Learning in an uncertain world.	Mana seguro pachapi yachay.
But that is the next step.	Ichaqa chaymi qatiqnin ruwayqa.
I want to do it faster.	Aswan utqaylla ruwayta munani.
Maybe he knew this.	Ichapas kayta yacharqa.
And that sounds great.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
You know where they are.	Yachankim maypi kasqankuta.
Preferably the beautiful one.	Aswan allinqa sumaq kaq.
This is a really big deal.	Kayqa chiqap hatun ruwaymi.
He wouldn’t have wanted to take it.	Payqa manan munanmanchu karqan chayta hap’iyta.
It wasn’t that hard for me.	Manam chayna sasachu karqa ñuqapaq.
That is doing the wrong thing.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwachkan.
Everything went wrong from there.	Tukuy imapas chaymanta mana allintachu rirqa.
Now he wants to know who you are.	Kunanqa yachayta munan pi kasqaykita.
Explain why this is important.	Willay imanasqa chay ruway ancha allin kasqanmanta.
John has to go tomorrow.	Juanqa paqarinmi rinan.
I think it’s coming this week.	Yuyaykuni kay semana hamunanta.
The two men were terrified.	Chay iskay runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
But nothing was ever so good.	Ichaqa manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina allinchu karqan.
He couldn't say no but he couldn't say yes.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu ichaqa manan arí niyta atirqanchu.
You can’t win with me.	Manan ñoqawanqa atipayta atiwaqchu.
Don't forget him.	Ama qunqaychu paytaqa.
This just sounds ridiculous.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinallam uyarikun.
I don’t want to be famous.	Manam munanichu riqsisqa kayta.
Do what you know how to do.	Yachasqaykita ruway.
Yes, he knew that.	Arí, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
But it’s night.	Ichaqa tutan.
Without doing so.	Mana chayta ruwaspa.
A few days ago.	Iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqta.
Be a little uncomfortable.	Huk rato mana allinchu kay.
There have always been good people.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi allin runakunaqa karqan.
I probably think so.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa piensani.
As fast, but faster.	Utqaylla hina, ichaqa aswan utqaylla.
Tell me what he did.	Willaway ima ruwasqanmanta.
He wants to know what’s wrong.	Ima mana allin kasqanmanta yachayta munan.
Maybe something happened to him.	Ichapas paywan imapas pasarqa.
No one knows exactly why yet.	Manaraqmi pipas allintachu yachan imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
It was hard to be sure.	Sasam karqa seguro kayqa.
One and then the other.	Huknin chaymanta huknin.
I'm sorry about it, but it's there.	Llakikuni chaymanta, ichaqa chaypim kachkan.
I thought it was amazing, he was great.	Admirakuypaqmi piensarqani, payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It was a beautiful experience.	Sumaqmi karqan.
You are doing a lot.	Achkatam ruwachkanki.
He said he had to do it.	Payqa nisqa, paymi ruwanan nispa.
I doubt it was bad.	Iskayrayani mana allin kasqanmanta.
It’s not good anymore.	Manañam allinchu.
He didn’t want to end up alone and crazy.	Payqa manan sapallanchu, loco hinachu tukuyta munarqan.
They know everything about you.	Paykunaqa tukuy imatam qammanta yachanku.
However, there is a strange thing here.	Ichaqa, kaypiqa huk mana riqsisqa kaqmi kachkan.
He looked funny though.	Payqa asikunapaq hinam ichaqa rikchakurqa.
Everything went on for about an hour.	Tukuy imapas huk hora hinam rirqa.
It was a really hard time.	Chiqamanta sasa tiempo karqa.
Please, please let me know.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa willaway.
And, anyway .	Hinaspa, imayna kaptinpas .
That almost never means.	Chayqa yaqa mana hayk’aqpas niyta munan.
And do it again, and do it again.	Hinaspa yapamanta ruway, hinaspa yapamanta ruway.
Probably never will be.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
Maybe all the time.	Ichapas tukuy tiempo.
This is where people want to be.	Kaypim runakunaqa kayta munanku.
It tried, it really did.	Chayqa kallpachakurqanmi, cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
If you know, tell me.	Yachanki chayqa willaway.
We had to make a movie.	Huk peliculata ruwanayku karqan.
And again not at all like him at all.	Hinaspa yapamanta mana imapipas pay hinachu ni imapipas.
That’s all he is.	Chayllam payqa kachkan.
I never went again after that.	Chaymantaqa manañam hukmanta rirqanichu.
You’re happier now.	Kunanqa aswan kusisqan kanki.
There is a need to do the right thing.	Chaypaqqa allintam ruwananchik.
No time for that.	Mana pacha chaymanta.
So there’s nothing like being there.	Chaymi chaypi kay hinaqa mana imapas kanchu.
If you want something else, let me know.	Huk imatapas munanki chayqa, willaway.
I know something is coming.	Yachanim imapas hamunanta.
This one was mine.	Kayqa ñuqapa kaqmi karqa.
Something left him.	Imapas paytaqa saqirqa.
There was no reason, ever, for it not to be true.	Manam imaraykupas karqachu, haykapipas, mana chiqap kananpaq.
Maybe he wanted to be with her.	Ichapas payqa paywan kuska kayta munarqa.
The people there, anyway.	Chaypi kaq runakuna, imayna kaptinpas.
But if you do, that’s fine.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
He says yes to it.	Payqa arí nispam nin.
So he was tough, like that.	Chaymi payqa sinchi millay karqan, chay hinata.
Or, better yet, ten years.	Utaq, aswan allinqa, chunka wata.
But what made it happen.	Ichaqa imataq chayta ruwarqa.
Here it is and this is it.	Kaypi kachkan hinaspa kaymi.
And now he’s .	Hinaspa kunanqa payqa .
He didn't know if he would, but he didn't know.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwananta icha manachus chayta, ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap kasqanmanta.
A lot of time.	Achka pacha.
In most cases, probably not.	Yaqa llapanpim manapaschá.
Two and a half years.	Iskay wata kuskan.
They had a great early precedent for that.	Paykunaqa chaypaqqa hatun ñawpaq ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
I mean, you look ridiculous.	Niyta munani, asikunapaq hinam rikchakunki.
That will take more time.	Chayqa aswan tiempon kanqa.
We have been like that for many years.	Achka watañam chayna kanchik.
I really like it!.	¡Chiqamanta gustan!.
Now I don’t know what to say.	Kunanqa manan yachanichu ima niyta.
That, however, would be a bad thing.	Chaywanmi ichaqa mana allinchu kanman.
For now, of course.	Kunankamaqa, sut’inmi.
This thing is very safe.	Kay imapas ancha segurom.
Everything was set up for him.	Lliwmi paypaq churasqa karqa.
These people are ridiculous.	Kay runakunaqa asikunapaq hinam kanku.
He couldn’t ignore it anymore.	Manañan chaytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanchu.
He was busy as usual.	Payqa sapa kuti hinam ocupasqa karqa.
I did it in a ridiculous way.	Asikunapaq hinam ruwarqani.
He can’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikuyta atinchu.
Pretty, yes, but familiar.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq, arí, ichaqa riqsisqa.
I mean maybe, maybe it was a chance.	Niyta munani ichapas, ichapas huk chansa karqa.
He felt so foolish.	Payqa ancha mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqa.
But anything is anything for me.	Ichaqa imapas imapas ñuqapaq.
But that makes him happier.	Chaywanmi ichaqa aswan kusisqa tarikun.
Most of the time I feel crazy.	Yaqa llapanpim loco hina tarikuni.
You do these things.	Chaykunataqa ruwanki.
But no one can really do that.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtapuni chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
He knows it doesn’t fit.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayman hinachu kasqanmanta.
Obviously alone if there is one.	Sut’inmi sapallan sichus kan chayqa.
It was a wonderful time.	Chayqa ancha sumaq tiempon karqan.
I felt rather stupid.	Aswan sonso hinam tarikurqani.
He had just started riding a bike.	Chayraqmi bicicletapi puriyta qallaykurqa.
I thought he did a wonderful job.	Yuyarqanin sumaq llank’ayta ruwasqanmanta.
It would be great to pretend.	Ancha allinmi kanman hina ruwayqa.
He will probably do better things.	Yaqapaschá aswan allin ruwaykunata ruwanqa.
Great first date.	Hatun ñawpaq p’unchaw.
I don’t want to see everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas qawayta munanichu.
I don’t know what to do for him.	Manam yachanichu paypaq imata ruwanaypaq.
But here I am, I am.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkani.
He can be a very bad guy.	Payqa ancha millay runam kanman.
I would have been, once.	Ñuqa kayman karqa, huk kuti.
Many unknowns.	Mana riqsisqa achka.
He can never help her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yanapayta atinmanchu.
And then another one.	Hinaspa chaymanta huknin.
Know what’s going to happen.	Yachay imakuna pasananta.
I thought it was mine.	Ñuqaqa ñuqapa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He is always too busy.	Payqa sapa kutim llumpay ocupasqa kachkan.
I fear disappointment.	Hukmanyasqa kaytam manchakuni.
There is no chance of that.	Chaypaqqa manan kanchu chansa.
So that was his real name.	Chaymi chaymi karqan cheqaq sutin.
Anyway, it's better than it is.	Imayna kaptinpas, aswan allinmi kasqanmantaqa.
He loved to sing.	Payqa anchatam takiyta munarqa.
He couldn't believe what had happened.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
You were a wonderful person.	Qamqa ancha sumaq runam karqanki.
They were great about it.	Paykunaqa chaymanta hatunmi karqaku.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chayna kaptinqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
Let 's wait	Suyasun .
I was exhausted tonight.	Kunan tutaqa sayk’usqañan karqani.
I hope it’s true.	Suyachkani chiqap kananta.
The process, however, is not foolproof.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa mana sonso hinachu.
Nothing to tell you about myself.	Mana imapas ñuqamanta willanaypaq.
Something you can’t do either.	Imapas qampas mana ruway atisqaykita.
You can’t do it again.	Manan hukmanta atiwaqchu.
Last night was pretty amazing.	Qayna tutaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
But he had no idea who they were.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu pikuna kasqankuta.
He shouldn’t be like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
That wasn’t funny at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
I think he’s in trouble.	Yuyaykuni sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
I know, easy for me to say.	Yachanim, facilmi ñuqapaq niyta.
You either do this or you don’t.	Kayta ruwanki icha mana.
They’re a little nervous about him now.	Kunanqa huk chhikantan paymanta mancharisqa kashanku.
They agreed, but barely.	Paykunaqa acuerdopi karqanku, ichaqa yaqapaschá.
I think something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
Even if it’s kind of true.	Huk laya chiqap kaptinpas.
Eventually he has to.	Qhepamanmi payqa ruwanan.
You are there, no one else.	Qanmi kan, manan pipas.
Much, worse.	Ancha, aswan mana allin.
He knew nothing about me.	Payqa manan imatapas ñoqamanta yacharqanchu.
He failed twice.	Iskay kutitam mana allintachu ruwarqa.
We are reasonable people here.	Kaypiqa allin yuyayniyuq runakunam kanchik.
Today is the third day.	Kunan punchawmi kimsa punchaw.
I couldn’t sit down, I couldn’t eat.	Manam tiyayta atirqanichu, manam mikuyta atirqanichu.
But again, it’s not true.	Ichaqa yapamanta, manan cheqaqchu.
I am a beautiful person.	Sumaq runam kani.
Everything else is wrong .	Tukuy imapas mana allinmi .
I didn’t know why I was sad.	Manam yacharqanichu imarayku llakisqa kasqayta.
I, however, want to play this.	Ñuqam ichaqa kayta pukllayta munani.
It was nice to be there again.	Chaypi yapamanta kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
That’s a long-standing thing.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Now it is not difficult.	Kunanqa manañam sasachu.
I knew it right away.	Chayllam yacharqani.
But, you knew where you were.	Ichaqa, maypi kasqaykita yacharqanki.
Maybe it’s all those things.	Ichapas chay tukuy imakuna kanman.
It wasn’t very good.	Ancha mana allinchu karqa.
It just seemed too ridiculous.	Chayqa llumpay asikunapaq hinallam karqa.
A really bad guy.	Chiqap mana allin runa.
It will probably never happen again.	Yaqapaschá manaña hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa kanqachu.
It came with it.	Chaywanmi hamurqa.
So he stayed at home.	Chaymi payqa wasinpi qhepakurqan.
I am a great teacher.	Ñuqaqa hatun yachachiqmi kani.
And it makes a nice gift.	Hinaspa sumaq regalota ruwan.
That was always a bad thing to do.	Chayqa sapa kutim mana allin ruway karqa.
That’s the single best thing you can do.	Chayqa sapallan aswan allin ruwaymi.
This is not ready.	Kayqa manam listochu kachkan.
I’m the one, though.	Ñuqam ichaqa kani.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi pantasqa kashan.
That's crazy.	Chayqa loco hinam.
It’s really hard out there.	Chiqamanta sasa hawapi.
Still, he couldn't.	Chayna kaptinpas payqa manam atirqachu.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manan allinchu chay ruwayqa.
And he was disappointed.	Hinaspa hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
What happened one night.	Imataq huk tuta pasarqa.
So they’re always up to date.	Chaymi paykunaqa sapa kuti kunan pacha kanku.
I'd be more attractive.	Aswan sumaq rikchayniyuq kayman.
It’s been a really tough year.	Chiqamanta sasa wata karqa.
Meaning faster.	Niyta munan aswan utqaylla.
He was scared, that was all.	Payqa mancharisqa, chaylla karqa.
That’s great, man.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, runa.
Fortunately, there seemed to be plenty.	Ancha kusisqa, achka hinam karqa.
But that would have been a bit much.	Ichaqa chayqa huk chhikantan askha kanman karqan.
So, there it goes.	Chaymi, chaypi rin.
First of all, don’t do that.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ama chayta ruwaychu.
He is not me.	Payqa manam ñuqachu.
Again, he was to blame.	Yapamanta, paymi huchayoq karqan.
It's a day.	P'unchawmi.
But this is the best part about it.	Ichaqa kaymi chaymanta aswan allin kaq.
He came with us.	Paymi ñuqaykuwan kuska hamurqa.
He did a little bit wrong.	Payqa huk chhikantan mana allintachu ruwarqan.
He is happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam tarikun.
Forgive me, forgive me.	Pampachaykuway, pampachaykuway.
I don’t care about that now.	Kunanqa manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
He looks inhuman.	Payqa mana runa hinam rikchakun.
Really nice people here.	Chiqamanta sumaq runakuna kaypi.
Eat real food.	Chiqap mikhunata mikhuy.
If there is anything, let me know.	Imapas kaptinqa willaway.
He was with me all night.	Payqa tukuy tutan ñoqawan kasharqan.
First, it is consistently successful in practice.	Ñawpaqtaqa, sapa kutim allinta ruwan ruwaypi.
Now you have to do that again.	Kunanqa hukmanta chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I felt foolish and alone.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinaspa sapallay hinam tarikurqani.
He said he wasn't feeling well.	Payqa mana allinchu kashasqanmanta nirqa.
It was well placed.	Allin churasqa karqan.
But then there was nothing.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan imapas karqanchu.
He couldn’t have done that.	Manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
If no one is at the party, make it bigger.	Sichus mana pipas chay fiestapi kanchu chayqa, aswan hatun ruway.
Now there is, for me.	Kunanqa kanmi, ñuqapaq.
Without it, everything is wrong.	Mana chaywanqa tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
He can play the role now.	Payqa kunanmi chay ruwayta ruwanman.
Not really sure why, but it seemed kind of disappointing.	Mana chiqaptachu seguro imarayku, ichaqa huk laya hukmanyasqa hinam karqa.
Everyone knows where this guy is.	Lliwmi yachanku maypi kay runa kasqanmanta.
Wouldn’t that be great?.	¿Manachu chayqa hatun kanman?.
Can’t say how good it was.	Mana rimayta atinchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
He takes the initiative.	Paymi ñawpaqtaqa imatapas ruwan.
So it didn't seem any worse.	Chaymi mana aswan mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
Do! 	Ruway!
Do something else.	Huk ruwaytapas ruway.
He didn’t seem crazy.	Payqa manan loco hinachu karqan.
That wasn’t the case, happily.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan, kusisqa.
Last night, maybe.	Qayna tuta, kanman.
Getting injured is foolish.	K'irisqa kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi.
You have been with us for a very long time.	Ancha ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqaykuwan kachkanki.
I didn’t think about it anymore.	Manañam chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
We have to act quickly.	Usqhaylla ruwanayku tiyan.
Eat something first.	Ñawpaqtaqa imatapas mikhuy.
And he’s .	Hinaspa payqa .
No one was supposed to do those things.	Manam pipas chaykunataqa ruwananchu karqa.
Where the people live.	Maypi tiyaq runakuna.
This whole thing was crazy.	Kay tukuy imapas loco hinam karqa.
Anything though, really.	Imapas ichaqa, chiqaptaqa.
It just happened that I was here.	Chayllaraqmi kaypi kasqaymanta pasarqa.
It was good, for sure.	Allinmi karqa, seguro.
So far I like it, it’s really nice.	Kunankamaqa gustanmi, chiqap sumaqmi.
You are, you know.	Qamqa kanki, yachanki.
That’s how I learned.	Chaynatam yacharqani.
That is neither right nor wrong.	Chaytaqa manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
He couldn't keep up with her.	Payqa manan paywan kuska kayta atirqanchu.
He was happy that it was.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan chhayna kasqanmanta.
Like, really nice.	Imayna, chiqap sumaq.
The process would be very simple.	Chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi kanman.
Beautiful or not.	Sumaq utaq mana.
You, here with me.	Qam, kaypi ñuqawan.
Everything turned out great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi lluqsirqa.
He is a summer man.	Payqa verano runam.
If anything, it was good.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, allinmi karqan.
That’s exactly what he said.	Chayqa nisqanman hinam.
He did pretty well.	Payqa allin allintam ruwarqa.
It is not according to good practice.	Manan allin ruwayman hinachu.
The colder the better.	Aswan chiri kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
If he wanted to do that, fine.	Sichus chayta ruwayta munarqan chayqa, allinmi.
He couldn’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atirqachu.
But the same problem.	Ichaqa kikin sasachakuy.
This didn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allintachu rikchakurqa.
That’s what it’s all about.	Chayqa chaymantam rimachkan.
Isn’t that a good thing?.	¿Mana allinchu chay?.
It wouldn't have been ten days without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa manam chunka punchawchu kanman karqa.
That would have been a lot sadder.	Chayqa aswan llakikuypaqmi kanman karqa.
He was here, yes.	Payqa kaypim karqa, arí.
I can't tell you exactly when.	Manam allintachu willayta atiyman haykapi kasqanmantaqa.
Very nice, right?.	Ancha sumaqmi, ¿aw?.
It’s a job.	Ruwaymi.
Do this two or three times a day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchaw iskay kimsa kutita ruway.
And more of that the next day.	Hinaspa aswan chaymanta qhipa p’unchaw.
It was clear what we had to do now.	Sut’inmi karqan kunan ima ruwanayku kasqanmanta.
Therein lies the problem.	Chaypin kashan chay sasachakuy.
He wasn't really mine.	Payqa manam chiqaptachu ñuqapa karqa.
You did well today.	Kunan punchawmi allinta ruwarqanki.
Please be careful and casual.	Ama hina kaspa allinta hinaspa mana imatapas ruwaspa ruway.
It lasted about an hour.	Chayqa huk hora hinam karqa.
I had no idea, why.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani, imarayku.
He was really happy.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqa.
So far, nothing has been able to do that.	Kunankamaqa manam imapas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqachu.
The third method is the most common.	Kimsa kaq ruwaymi aswan riqsisqa.
Something is wrong in this city.	Kay llaqtapiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
I thought it would be better.	Aswan allin kanman nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
But so far he could do nothing.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I want everybody out.	Tukuy runa lluqsiyta munani.
You really have to do it.	Chiqaptam ruwanayki.
That’s the only thing I’m really excited about.	Chayllam chaymantaqa anchata kusikuni.
I’ll be here in the morning.	Tutamanta kaypi kasaq.
I can't be hurt anymore.	Manañam k'irisqa kayta atiymanchu.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.	Ancha kusisqam chay runakunaqa yarqaymanta karqaku.
I found it ridiculously funny.	Chaytaqa asikunapaq hina asikunapaq hinam karqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allintam karqa.
A good man, as far as he can’t.	Allin runa, mana atisqanman hina.
That’s going to be me.	Chayqa ñuqam kasaq.
So it could be that he is guilty.	Chaymi chayna kanman huchayoq kasqanmanta.
Someone knows how to do this better.	Pipas yachan aswan allinta kayta ruwayta.
That was pretty clear.	Chayqa sumaq sut’inmi karqan.
There is no certainty that this will happen.	Manan kanchu seguro kay pasananta.
Everyone was in the house.	Llapallankum chay wasipi karqaku.
It wasn’t the only problem.	Manam chayllachu sasachakuy karqa.
Yeah, nothing there.	Arí, mana imapas chaypichu.
I just saw this tonight.	Chayraqmi kunan tuta kayta rikurqani.
He says it’s very important to talk to you.	Paymi nin ancha importante kasqanmanta qanwan rimananpaq.
Unfortunately, that doesn't always work.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa manam sapa kutichu allinta ruwan.
Mary wouldn’t want to.	Mariaqa manam munanmanchu.
I know it’s coming.	Yachanim hamunanta.
I am very angry now.	Kunanqa anchatam phiñasqa kachkani.
Being at home is a great thing.	Wasipi kayqa ancha allinmi.
Everyone knows where they are.	Lliwmi yachanku maypi kasqankuta.
One of the lowest.	Huknin aswan pisi kaq.
I don’t know how you figure that out.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta yuyaykunki chayta.
A lot of that’s mine.	Achka chaymanta ñuqapa.
But so far there is none.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan kanchu.
He knows he’s here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi kashasqanmanta.
I can say the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaytan niyta atiyman.
It really has to be for some reason.	Cheqaqtapunin kanan imaraykupas.
You agreed with me earlier about that.	Chaymantaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ñoqawan acuerdopi karqanki.
All is well here.	Tukuy allinmi kaypi.
I couldn't find a way to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa manam tariyta atirqanichu.
I didn’t really want to do it.	Manam anchatachu ruwayta munarqani.
Whoever that is.	Pipas chay kaptinpas.
But this is not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa mana allinchu.
Like you, now.	Qan hina, kunan.
I think it is a problem now.	Kunanqa sasachakuy kasqanmantam piensani.
I still want that.	Hinallam chayta munani.
They seemed very rich.	Paykunaqa ancha qhapaq hinam karqaku.
But there they were, every day.	Ichaqa chaypim karqaku, sapa punchaw.
We are human beings.	Runa runakunam kanchik.
I know where you are.	Yachanim maypi kasqaykita.
No one could have done it without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam pipas ruwayta atinmanchu karqa.
Like really hard.	Chiqap sinchi hina.
I never thought it would happen now.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kunan chayna kananta.
He can’t beat it.	Payqa manam atipayta atinchu.
This was actually rather interesting.	Kayqa chiqamanta aswan sumaq karqa.
He wouldn’t have been like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
And it took some time.	Hinaspa huk tiempota pasarqa.
So with him.	Chaymi paywan kuska.
And that wasn’t somewhere with nobody.	Hinaspa chayqa manan maypipas mana piwanpas karqanchu.
It’s really mine.	Chiqaptam ñuqapa.
Another evil month.	Huk millay killa.
Too many people in the house.	Ancha achka runakuna chay wasipi.
Learn more later.	Qhepaman astawan yachay.
I knew about it a long time ago.	Unayñan chaymantaqa yacharqani.
That’s a crazy thing to do.	Chayqa loco ruwaymi.
If they were great, you’re in luck.	Sichus hatun karqanku chayqa, suerteyoqmi kanki.
And, something else.	Hinaspa, huk imapas.
I mean, this one.	Niyta munani, kayta.
You are not a bad or flawed person.	Manan mana allinchu nitaq pantasqa runachu kanki.
It’s no more real now than it’s ever been.	Kunanqa manan aswan cheqaqchu hayk’aqpas kasqanmantaqa.
Again, many thanks.	Yapamanta, achka gracias.
That was what he thought at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chaytan yuyaykurqan.
He is not a stupid man.	Payqa manam sonso runachu.
That’s a lot of action.	Chayqa achka ruwaymi.
They were really nice people.	Paykunaqa chiqap sumaq runakunam karqaku.
He tried, but couldn't speak.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi, ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I don’t feel comfortable with that.	Manam chaywanqa allintachu tarikuni.
He caught it there.	Chaypi hap’irqan.
They are much nicer than that.	Paykunaqa chaymantaqa aswan sumaqmi kanku.
I love to eat.	Mikhuyta anchata munani.
That you can eat.	Mikhuyta atisqaykita.
But I can’t go crazy.	Ichaqa manan loco kayta atiymanchu.
Do something really new.	Chiqap musuq kaqta ruway.
Here is what it looks like.	Kaypim imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
Two days passed, then a third.	Iskay punchawmi pasarqa, chaymanta kimsa kaq punchaw.
He started going there every day.	Sapa punchawmi chayman riyta qallaykurqa.
There is a new process.	Huk musuq ruwaymi kachkan.
Maybe it wasn't such a big deal.	Ichapas mana chayna hatun ruwaychu karqa.
He wanted to do this.	Payqa kayta ruwayta munarqa.
I was, like, two.	Ñuqaqa karqani, hina, iskay.
He ultimately refused to do so.	Payqa qhepamanmi mana chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Man, that was bad.	Runa, chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
I have done this twice.	Chaytaqa iskay kutitam ruwarqani.
This may be the easiest thing you can do.	Kayqa aswan facilmi kanman ima ruwanaykipaq.
Doing just about anything would be better.	Yaqa tukuy imatapas ruwayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I couldn’t get to it.	Chaymanqa manam chayayta atirqanichu.
I really don’t know how you do this.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu imaynatachus kayta ruwanki chayta.
Said it was nothing.	Nisqa mana imapas kasqanmanta.
You know, he's fine.	Yachanki, payqa allinmi kachkan.
Something didn't seem quite right.	Imapas mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
Go and tell me, please.	Riy hinaspa willaway, ama hina kaspa.
He doesn’t really know what it is.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan imachus kasqanmanta.
Another big no no.	Huk hatun mana mana.
I hope you can work it out.	Suyachkani chayta allichayta atisqaykita.
He said it was very popular.	Payqa ancha riqsisqa kasqanmantam nirqa.
He won’t do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwanqachu.
There are no bad guys here.	Kaypiqa manam kanchu mana allin runakunaqa.
He spoke well of you.	Payqa allintan qanmanta rimarqan.
He knew her name, but nothing.	Payqa yacharqanmi sutinta, ichaqa manan imatapas.
That will be faster.	Chayqa aswan utqayllam kanqa.
I never saw that coming.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
You do it, you do it.	Qamqa ruwanki, ruwanki.
Thus,  .	Kayna, .
It wasn’t the last time.	Manan qhepa kutichu karqan.
All but one, that is.	Llapan hukmanta aswan, chaymi.
And he said.	Hinan nirqan.
It was a great week.	Hatun semanan karqan.
Tom was right.	Tomqa allintan rimarqan.
He refuses to understand, to know.	Payqa manan munanchu entiendeyta, yachayta.
Not sure what's with it.	Mana segurochu imakuna chaywan kasqanmanta.
He said so last week.	Chaynatam qayna semana nirqa.
I actually want to.	Chiqaptaqa munani.
That’s a good thing.	Allinmi chaymi.
I don’t want anything whatsoever.	Manam imatapas munanichu imatapas.
It was a great day!.	¡Ancha hatun punchawmi karqa!.
I know anyway.	Yachanim imayna kaptinpas.
I felt happier.	Aswan kusisqam tarikurqani.
They have always existed.	Paykunaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqanku.
At that moment in time.	Chay rato tiempopi.
He will do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanqa.
He is still unconscious.	Payqa kunankamapas mana yuyayniyuqmi kachkan.
Not everything is safe or secure.	Manan tukuy imapas segurochu nitaq segurochu.
He is sure of it.	Payqa segurom chaymantaqa kachkan.
So it’s a difficult thing to do.	Chaymi sasa ruwayqa.
You’re in luck, boy.	Suerteyoqmi kanki, wayna.
It is simple, but very difficult to do.	Chayqa facilmi, ichaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
I heard that somewhere.	Chaytaqa maypipas uyarirqanim.
But he didn’t want to be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kayta munarqan.
But, it’s okay now.	Ichaqa, kunanqa allinmi.
Not in disagreement.	Mana mana acuerdopichu.
He looked a little sick.	Payqa huk chikan unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He knew he would never be like her.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas pay hina kananta.
Now tell me how.	Kunanqa willaway imaynatachus chayta.
I’ll go here with that.	Chaywanmi kayman risaq.
Maybe it will be more interesting for you.	Ichapas aswan sumaq kanqa qampaq.
I don't believe that now.	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa creenichu.
Nice guy, but kind of a bad boy.	Sumaq runa, ichaqa imayna mana allin wayna.
Learn to think.	Yuyaymanayta yachay.
He never really talked about it after that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu chaymanta rimarqan chay qhepaman.
The right thing, the right thing .	Allin kaq, allin kaq .
That means that it is difficult to do so.	Chayqa niyta munan, chayta ruwayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
Not a big secret.	Mana hatun pakasqa.
I disagree with you on that.	Chaymantaqa manan qanwan acuerdopichu kani.
And he says he can’t sleep at home.	Hinaspa wasinpi mana puñuyta atinchu nin.
Do the easy stuff first.	Ñawpaqtaqa chay facil ruwaykunata ruway.
I don’t want to tell you anything.	Manam imatapas willayta munanichu.
And now the real thing, the real thing in action.	Hinaspa kunan chiqap kaq, chiqap kaq ruwaypi.
But maybe another time.	Ichaqa ichapas huk kutipi.
No one has that.	Chaytaqa manan pipas kanchu.
It's almost always like a day.	Yaqa sapa kuti huk punchaw hinam.
For some reason, or for no reason.	Imaraykupas, utaq mana imaraykupas.
That means a lot of talking and then more talking.	Chayqa niyta munan achka rimayta chaymanta aswan rimayta.
Not every day, but sometimes.	Mana sapa p’unchawchu, aswanpas wakin kutipi.
At least it doesn’t.	Aswanpas manan.
He couldn't tell her that.	Chaytaqa manam willayta atirqachu.
Now, they’re great.	Kunanqa, hatunmi kanku.
Yes, he was, he was.	Arí, payqa karqan.
He can't win, you know.	Payqa manam atipayta atinchu, yachanki.
I was always very busy.	Sapa kutim ancha ocupasqa karqani.
No chance out here.	Mana chansa kaypi hawapi.
This is the best part.	Kayqa aswan allin kaqmi.
I went there once.	Huk kutitam rirqani.
Here it was recently.	Kaypiqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
I feel safer here.	Kaypiqa aswan segurom tarikuni.
I am very, very funny.	Ancha ancha asikunapaq hinam kani.
Everyone wants to see what happens next.	Llapallankum qawayta munanku chaymanta imakuna pasananta.
He was a year younger than me.	Payqa huk wata sullk'a karqan ñoqamanta.
So nobody is.	Chaymi mana pipas.
There is hardly anything there.	Yaqapaschá chaypiqa mana imapas kanchu.
He had to do the right thing.	Payqa allintam ruwanan karqa.
But it will never happen.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
It was funny when it happened.	Chayna kaptinqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
He's a very nice guy, actually.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam, chiqaptaqa.
And yes, there was a moment.	Hinaspa arí, huk rato karqan.
That means something.	Chayqa imapas niyta munan.
Yes please, do it.	Arí ama hina kaspa, ruway.
I think this is very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi nispam piensani.
Not just in the past.	Mana chayllachu ñawpaq tiempopi.
It was to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanan karqa.
If it is not true, it does not exist.	Mana chiqap kaptinqa manam kanchu.
But it had been a long time.	Ichaqa unayñan kasqa.
I hope there will be many more followers.	Suyachkani aswan achka qatiqnin kananta.
He told you it happened.	Paymi nisurqanki chay pasasqanmanta.
That seems a bit excessive.	Chayqa huk chikan llumpay hinam.
He is eager to succeed.	Payqa anchatam munan allinta ruwayta.
It may never happen again.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kanqa.
I am still very depressed.	Hinallam sinchi llakisqa kachkani.
That may not have been a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu karqan.
This can be a really difficult task.	Kayqa chiqap sasa ruwaymi kanman.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayna kasqanmanta.
A couple weekends ago, in fact.	Huk iskay semana tukuy ñawpaqta, chiqaptaqa.
I wasn’t a big deal.	Manam hatun ruwaychu karqani.
He can’t, of course.	Payqa manan atinchu, sut’inmi.
He has most of the ideas with me.	Payqa yaqa llapan yuyayniyuqmi ñuqawan.
They were too many people.	Paykunaqa llumpay achka runakunam karqaku.
I don't know when that will happen.	Mana yachanichu haykapi chayna kananta.
Never like this again.	Ama hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa.
In fact, we did a lot more than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymanta aswan achkatam ruwarqayku.
I'll go in the morning.	Tutamanta risaq.
This is really stupid.	Kayqa chiqap sonso kaymi.
But there is no such thing as reality.	Ichaqa manan kanchu cheqaq kasqanmantaqa.
And this seemed like the right moment.	Hinaspa kayqa allin rato hina karqan.
That’s, knowledge.	Chayqa, yachay.
He had to do something first.	Ñawpaqtaqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Here's a date.	Kaypi huk p'unchaw.
No, he says, 'It's not.	Manam, nispas nin.
You certainly wouldn’t want things to be like that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana munawaqchu imapas chhayna kananta.
I can't take much of that now.	Chaymantaqa manam anchatachu kunanqa hapiyta atiyman.
It didn’t happen every day.	Manam sapa punchawchu pasarqa.
That is not true in that city.	Chayqa chay llaqtapiqa manan cheqaqchu.
Time to do nothing.	Mana imatapas ruwanapaq tiempo.
It’s useless now.	Kunan mana imapaqpas allin.
Maybe it should be, but still.	Ichapas chayna kanan, ichaqa chayna kaptinpas.
He was always so happy.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna kusisqa karqa.
Everyone is sure of it.	Lliwmi chaymantaqa seguro kachkanku.
Obviously someone got involved.	Sut’inmi pipas chayman haykurqan.
It’s so great,’ he says.	Ancha hatunmi’, nispas nin.
So he got out of there.	Chaymi chaymanta lluqsirqa.
Happy was the second.	Kusisqam karqa iskay kaq.
Make this what you want.	Kayta ruway munasqaykita.
I know it's summer.	Yachanim verano kasqanmanta.
There they are there.	Chaypim chaypi kachkanku.
I need this yesterday.	Kaytaqa qayna punchawmi necesitasaq.
This one really wanted to.	Kayqa chiqaptam munarqa.
But you never know???.	Ichaqa manan hayk'aqpas yachankichu???.
He said it was something.	Payqa imapas kasqanmantam nirqa.
Please share what you know.	Ama hina kaspa, imatachus yachasqaykita willay.
They are wonderful people, really good people.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaq runakunam, chiqap allin runakunam.
All too often.	Tukuy ancha sapa kuti.
Unknown to be anywhere.	Maypipas kananpaq mana riqsisqa.
No, he knew better than that.	Manan, chaymantaqa aswan allintan yacharqan.
I think it feels good.	Yuyaykuni allinta sientekusqanmanta.
I used to be a smoker.	Ñawpaqtaqa cigarrota pitaq kani.
In fact, he no longer cares what happened.	Aswanpas manañan imananpaschu imachus pasasqanmantaqa.
Something really, really bad.	Imapas chiqap, chiqap mana allin.
He never got anywhere.	Mana hayk’aqpas maymanpas chayayta atirqanchu.
This is the hardest, but most important part.	Kaymi aswan sasa, ichaqa aswan importante kaq.
I really want to hear it.	Anchatam uyariyta munani.
Yes, that was ridiculous.	Arí, chayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I knew I wasn't going to do that anymore, at least.	Yacharqanim manaña chayta ruwanaypaq, aswanpas.
No, they were there.	Manan, chaypi karqanku.
Actually it would be good.	Chiqaptaqa allinmi kanman.
You don’t want to be out there alone.	Manan munankichu sapallayki chay hawapi kayta.
I can fix it properly.	Allintam allichayta atiyman.
We agree on this.	Kaypiqa acuerdopi kayku.
It probably wasn’t good enough.	Manapaschá allinchu karqan.
He said that for about a year.	Chaynatam nirqa yaqa huk wata.
This man was eager to talk.	Kay runaqa anchatam rimayta munarqa.
The man didn’t look right.	Chay runaqa mana allintachu qhawarisqa.
But that was the past.	Ichaqa chayqa ñawpaq tiempon karqan.
There is certainly something here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi imapas kan.
Of course, you never knew what was going to happen.	Arí, manam haykapipas yacharqankichu ima pasananta.
Humanity is always there.	Runa kayqa sapa kutim kachkan.
But he didn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu nirqan.
How strong.	Imayna sinchi.
He was terribly wrong.	Payqa sinchitan pantasqa.
I'm actually not sure.	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu kani.
But there is no point in talking about it anymore.	Ichaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​chaymanta astawan rimayqa.
But this is not enough.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kayqa.
I was really drunk.	Chiqaptam machasqa karqani.
He is not here yet.	Payqa manaraqmi kaypichu kachkan.
Or very large.	Utaq ancha hatun.
He said it would be better.	Paymi nirqa aswan allin kananpaq.
Being human, not being human.	Runa kay, mana runa kaychu.
I didn’t want to remember anything more.	Manam imatapas astawan yuyariyta munarqanichu.
He spent about a month there in the hospital.	Chaypin yaqa huk killa hospitalpi kasharqan.
First of all, it’s not good.	Ñawpaqtaqa, mana allinchu.
He did some great things.	Wakin hatun ruwaykunata ruwarqan.
I can't work with that.	Chaywanqa manam llamkayta atiymanchu.
He’s smart and smart.	Payqa yachaysapa hinaspa yachaysapa.
I mean everybody knows this.	Kaytaqa llapa runam yachanku niyta munani.
Yes, it will be good.	Arí, allinmi kanqa.
That’s really nice about it.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi chaymanta.
I mean really bad.	Chiqap mana allintam niyta munani.
Maybe it is or it may be.	Ichapas chayna kanman utaq chayna kanman.
And she just looked really nice.	Hinaspa payqa chayllaraqmi chiqap sumaq rikchayniyuq karqa.
A few here and there.	Huk iskay kimsa kaypi chaypi.
I could never give up.	Manam haykapipas saqiyta atirqanichu.
He doesn’t have to do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwananchu.
I still can't be sure.	Kunankamapas manam seguro kayta atinichu.
He knew what lay ahead.	Payqa yacharqanmi qhepaman imakuna kananta.
So that’s what it is.	Chaymi chay kan.
I can’t see it.	Manam qawayta atinichu.
He's not ready to go yet.	Payqa manaraqmi rinanpaq listochu kachkan.
He looked silly.	Payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi rikchakurqa.
He mentioned it several times.	Payqa askha kutitan chaymanta rimarqan.
These are a few interesting ones.	Kaykunaqa iskay kimsa sumaqmi.
They want to play.	Paykunaqa pukllayta munanku.
They want to go to the party.	Paykunaqa fiestaman riyta munanku.
Thank you, everyone.	Gracias, llapa runa.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ichapas achka imapas.
You weren't good last night.	Qayna tutaqa manam allinchu karqanki.
It is very difficult to be here now.	Kunanqa kaypi kayqa ancha sasam.
I'll go, for so long.	Risaq, chayna unayta.
But it was terribly wrong.	Ichaqa manchay mana allinchu karqan.
But he was not a man.	Ichaqa manan runachu karqan.
But he refused to do anything.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.
But then you don’t know.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan yachankichu.
We used to walk it.	Chaytaqa puriq kayku.
But what will happen?.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanqa?.
I guess I know how to do it.	Yaqapaschá yachani imayna ruwayta.
That should be good for him.	Chayqa allinmi paypaq kanan.
He is indeed a great man.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa hatun runa.
He had no choice, you know.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, yachanki.
So far, it's very difficult.	Kunankamaqa, ancha sasam.
It was the same man.	Chay kikin runam karqa.
I'm not sure it really should be.	Manam segurochu kani chiqaptapuni kananmanta.
But he doesn't have time for that.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa manan tiempon kanchu.
Black people second.	Yana runakuna iskay kaq.
That is why it is now hidden.	Chayraykum kunanqa pakasqa kachkan.
This was a recent one.	Kayqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
Present, past, future.	Kunan, ñawpaq, hamuq pacha.
I’ll do that later.	Chaytaqa qhepamanmi ruwasaq.
It just came up right away.	Chayllaraqmi hamurqa.
So he faces a bad time in the future.	Chaymi hamuq tiempopi mana allin tiempopi tarikun.
I see no reason why you shouldn't.	Manam rikunichu imaraykupas mana chayta ruwanaykipaqqa.
Everything about it is relatively recent.	Tukuy imapas chaymantaqa aswan chayllaraqmi.
Many good people.	Achka allin runakuna.
I couldn’t give them up.	Chaykunataqa manam saqiyta atirqanichu.
Then he did it.	Chaymantam ruwarqa.
He wanted to talk.	Rimayta munarqa.
I saw it more than once.	Aswan huk kutitam rikurqani.
Now here we are, together again.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkaniku, hukmanta kuska.
It makes no sense, someone says.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu, nispas pipas nin.
He was badly hurt, like her.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa karqan, pay hina.
I think those people.	Yuyaykuni chay runakuna.
The first is evil.	Ñawpaq kaq millay.
All together, at least.	Tukuy kuska, aswan pisi.
Tell them how beautiful it is.	Willay imayna sumaq kasqanmanta.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam hatun karqa.
Hopefully one day you can too .	Munaymanmi huk punchaw qampas chayta ruwanaykipaq .
Learn something every day.	Sapa punchaw imatapas yachay.
Don’t do that anymore.	Manaña chaytaqa ruwaychu.
And when it didn’t work out, he did.	Hinaspa mana allinta ruwaptinqa ruwarqa.
What will it be for you?.	¿Imataq qampaq kanqa?.
He's happy, he's a player.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan, payqa pukllaqmi.
He wasn't sure, he said.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan, nispan nirqan.
In fact, that wasn’t a good thing.	Aswanpas chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
The former is better.	Ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi.
He is a real man, a good man.	Payqa chiqap runam, allin runam.
That was nothing you could do.	Chayqa manan imapas atiwaqchu karqan.
That’ll be something.	Chayqa imapas kanqa.
But this is not the case now.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu kunanqa.
He said he couldn't be sure.	Paymi nirqa mana imamantapas seguro kayta atisqanmanta.
It looked really sad.	Chiqap llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
It happened anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas pasarqa.
So it didn’t work out.	Chaymi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
They are beautiful people.	Paykunaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runakunam.
I couldn’t believe it either.	Ñoqapas manan creeyta atirqanichu.
He really doesn’t know anything.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana imatapas yachanchu.
But he didn’t do well at it.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaypiqa ruwarqan.
Very young crowd.	Ancha wayna achka runakuna.
He didn’t say this, or anything.	Payqa manan kayta, nitaq imatapas nirqanchu.
But everyone knows everything about you.	Ichaqa llapa runan qanmanta tukuyta yachanku.
It may be difficult.	Yaqapaschá sasa kanman.
Or, again, maybe not.	Utaq, yapamanta, manapaschá.
Maybe it’s this week.	Ichapas kay semana kanman.
Nothing makes any sense now.	Kunanqa manan imapas imapaqpas valenchu.
I am excited about this.	Kaymantaqa kusisqam kachkani.
He cannot understand it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa entiendeyta atinchu.
There were a lot of people there.	Chaypim ancha achka runakuna chaypi karqaku.
Yes, he would be.	Arí, payqa chayna kanman.
There he was.	Chaypin kasharqan.
She was worried and scared.	Payqa llakisqa, mancharisqa kasqa.
I don’t want anything to go wrong, either.	Manam munanichu imapas mana allin kananta, nitaq.
I wish you were here with me.	Munaymanmi kaypi ñuqawan kasqaykita.
I didn’t want that to happen.	Manam munarqanichu chayna kananta.
But he acts like a married man.	Ichaqa casarasqa runa hinan ruwan.
Someone asked me what happened.	Pipas tapuwarqa ima pasasqanmanta.
I can never tell.	Manam haykapipas willayta atiymanchu.
He can’t believe he did.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu chayta ruwasqanmanta.
How do you know my .	Imaynatataq yachanki ñuqapa .
He probably died happy.	Payqa yaqapaschá kusisqa wañupurqan.
At a real party.	Huk chiqap fiestapi.
You can’t do what you want.	Mana munasqaykita ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I really wanted to go.	Chiqaptam riyta munarqani.
The process is difficult.	Ruwayqa sasam.
So it’s not there.	Chaymi mana chaypichu.
And here is his name.	Hinaspa kaypi sutin kachkan.
But that’s fine with me.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi ñoqawanqa.
But this was the best.	Ichaqa kaymi aswan allin karqan.
It’s a crazy morning here.	Kaypiqa loco paqarinmi.
I never knew it would happen.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna kananta.
The easiest thing in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan facil kaq.
He didn’t want to believe it was true.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu cheqaq kasqanta.
There are too many people here.	Kaypiqa llumpay achka runakunam kachkan.
I know, you want to be me.	Yachanim, ñuqa kanaykita munanki.
Maybe it does, maybe not.	Ichapas chayna kanman, manapaschá.
I'd rather try something else.	Aswan allinmi kanman huk ruwaytapas ruwayqa.
I just can't seem to get it right.	Ichapas mana allintachu hapiyta atiyman hina.
They are wicked men, wicked men .	Paykunaqa mana allin runakunam, millay runakunam .
I still believe this to be true.	Kunankamapas kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam hapini.
One day you will be late.	Huk punchawmi tarde kanki.
I couldn’t see him anymore.	Manañam paytaqa rikuyta atirqanichu.
I can’t say too much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa rimayta atiyman.
It couldn't have been anyone else, really.	Manam huk runachu kanman karqa, chiqaptaqa.
So it’s useless now.	Chaymi kunanqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
She didn’t want to see him anymore.	Payqa manañan payta rikuyta munarqanchu.
But that was some time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
There are two ways to do this.	Chayna kaptinqa iskay ruwaymi.
And then we did it.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ruwarqayku.
I had to be here first.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaypim kanay karqa.
So, that was it, really.	Chaymi, chaymi karqa, chiqaptapuni.
Now this is a good guy.	Kunanqa kayqa allin runam.
But of course you knew that.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chaytaqa yacharqanki.
Maybe it never seemed like it.	Ichapas mana haykapipas chayna hinachu karqa.
No, there was nothing.	Manan, manan imapas karqanchu.
The more you do it, the better you’ll learn.	Astawan chayta ruwaspaqa aswan allintan yachanki.
You just didn’t know.	Chaylla mana yacharqankichu.
But there was more difficulty.	Ichaqa aswan sasa ruwaymi kasharqan.
I want to eat them.	Chaykunataqa mikhuyta munani.
Say you think about it.	Chaypi yuyaykunki niy.
I feel like that kid.	Chay wawa hinam tarikuni.
Be who you are.	Pichus kasqaykita kay.
But the truth is that he did.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi chay ruwasqanqa.
It will be coming soon.	Pisi tiempollamantan hamunqa.
There is nothing else to do with it.	Manam imapas huk ruwayqa kanchu chaywanqa.
You don’t know what it’s going to be like.	Mana yachankichu imayna kananta.
They are both great people.	Iskayninkum hatun runakuna.
I really couldn't tell you why.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He felt sick, he said.	Payqa unqusqa hinam tarikurqa, nispa.
You can’t be sure of it.	Manan seguro kayta atiwaqchu chaymanta seguro kayta.
He would probably be happy with that.	Chaywanqa yaqapaschá kusisqa kanman.
It won’t be hard for you.	Manam sasachu kanqa qampaq.
And you know what.	Hinaspa yachanki imata.
John wanted him to be so impressed.	Juanqa munarqanmi chhayna admirasqa kananta.
He didn’t want to know what was in it.	Payqa manan yachayta munarqanchu imakuna chaypi kashasqanmanta.
There is a home here for you, if you want.	Kaypiqa kanmi wasi qampaq, munaspaqa.
I hear it all.	Tukuy chayta uyarini.
Okay, he didn't say that exactly.	Allinmi, manam chaytaqa allintachu nirqa.
I think you have to do what’s right for you.	Yuyaykuni qampaq allin kaqta ruwanayki tiyan.
Just over and over again.	Chaylla yapamanta yapamanta.
After all, this was what he did.	Tukuy imamanta, kay ruwasqanqa karqa.
What is the third.	Imataq kimsa kaq.
He was really cold.	Payqa chiqap chiri karqa.
He had no idea what had happened.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
It’s there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi kachkan.
You may disagree with me on this point.	Kaypiqa manapaschá ñoqawan acuerdopichu kanki.
But he couldn’t believe it.	Ichaqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
He does the same thing.	Payqa chaynatam ruwan.
Everything was absurd.	Tukuy imapas mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Actually, this is not good.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa manam allinchu.
One of them was injured.	Hukninmi k’irisqa karqan.
Eventually I ignored it.	Qhepamanmi mana uyarirqanichu.
The last step is incorrect.	Qhipa ruwayqa mana allinchu.
But he was very good.	Ichaqa payqa ancha allinmi karqan.
But then, then, nothing.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chaymanta, mana imapas.
It’s not like it’s here.	Manam kaypi hinachu.
After that, he came almost every day.	Chay qhepamanmi yaqa sapa p’unchay hamurqan.
He wants it here.	Payqa kaypim munan.
Even if there are people, they want to do that.	Runakuna kaptinpas chaytam ruwayta munanku.
It could be a mistake.	Pantasqa kanman.
But after that, there was almost no time for him.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi yaqa manaña tiempo karqanchu paypaq.
Not sure what it looks like now.	Mana segurochu kunan imayna kasqanmanta.
I’m lucky to have him.	Suerteyoqmi kani paywan kasqaymanta.
And, that’s what we did.	Hinaspa, chayta ruwarqayku.
I thought it was almost there.	Yaqa chaypi kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I feel hurt and angry.	K’irisqa, phiñasqa ima sientekuni.
One half of the	Huk kuskan.
What we’re doing.	Ima ruwasqaykumanta.
The point was obvious.	Chay nisqanqa sut’inmi karqan.
He should be fine though.	Payqa allinmi kanan ichaqa.
Being sick is hard.	Unqusqa kayqa sasam.
I just hope you can sleep now.	Chaylla suyachkani kunan puñuyta atisqaykita.
Here was the problem.	Kaypim sasachakuy karqa.
I wonder if he knows this.	Kayta yachanchu icha manachu tapukuni.
It doesn’t sound like me at all.	Manam ñuqa hinachu uyarikun ni imapipas.
It looks great.	Hatunmi rikchakun.
I really wanted it here.	Anchatam kaypi munarqani.
There was nothing to be done.	Manam imapas ruwanapaq hinachu karqa.
But he didn’t say anything to anyone.	Ichaqa manan pimanpas ni imatapas nirqanchu.
He’s not where he’s supposed to be.	Payqa manan maypichus kanan chaypichu kashan.
She wasn't sure it had ever been like that before.	Payqa manan segurochu karqan ñawpaqpi chhayna kasqanmanta.
I know it was a while ago.	Yachanim huk pacha ñawpaq kasqanmanta.
It’s not easy at all.	Manam facilchu ni imapipas.
He would like that.	Payqa chaytan munanman.
Tired and hungry and very, very drunk.	Sayk’usqa yarqasqa hinaspa ancha, ancha machasqa.
All of this is what it is.	Tukuy kaymi kan.
That’s right, yes.	Chayna, arí.
Yeah, that sounds crazy.	Arí, chayqa loco hinam uyarikun.
But it was earlier that evening.	Ichaqa chay ch’isi ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
It would never be right.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kanman.
He felt foolish.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqa.
Everything has gone wonderfully so far.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi rirqa.
He wanted it to be better.	Payqa munarqanmi aswan allin kananta.
Everyone wants to win.	Lliwmi atipayta munanku.
He knows you are busy.	Payqa yachanmi ocupasqa kasqaykita.
It sure sounds good.	Seguro allinta uyarikun.
That made some sense.	Chayqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
He must be a good man.	Payqa allin runam kanan.
I think he was scared for me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqapaq mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
But he really didn’t need to.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana necesitarqanchu.
It doesn’t exist anymore.	Manañan chaytaqa kanchu.
He isn’t there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kashan.
Unfortunately, this is the next big problem.	Llakikuypaqmi kay qatiqnin hatun sasachakuy.
Yes this must be him.	Arí kayqa paymi kanan.
He was happy, he said.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa, nispa.
But he would not see her.	Ichaqa manan payta rikuyta munarqanchu.
I tried a lot.	Achkatam kallpanchakurqani.
Such a man, such a man.	Chayna runa, chayna runa.
That is the most important thing to do.	Chay ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
Otherwise these are nice.	Mana chayqa kaykunaqa sumaqmi.
It was as well as it could be.	Chayqa allintam atisqanman hina karqa.
Probably late next summer.	Yaqapaschá hamuq verano tukukuypi.
Such a time.	Chayna pacha.
He would love to talk to you.	Payqa anchatam munanman qamwan rimayta.
Very good chance.	Ancha allin chansa.
In the present tense.	Kunan pachapi.
Many times.	Achka kutita.
You said that before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi nirqanki.
This is not the final step.	Kayqa manan qhepa kaq ruwaychu.
He always wanted to be there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi kananta munarqa.
I wanted to tell him not to do that.	Chaytaqa ama ruwananpaqmi niyta munarqani.
They are all like that.	Llapallankum chayna kachkanku.
That's why we're out here.	Chayraykum kay hawapi kachkaniku.
I was scared, really really scared.	Mancharisqa karqani, chiqap chiqap mancharisqa.
You’ll know that immediately.	Chayllam chayta yachanki.
And not about him.	Hinaspa mana paymanta.
Loneliness is a bad thing.	Sapallan kayqa mana allinmi.
Everyone always looked so bad.	Lliwmi sapa kuti chayna mana allin rikchayniyuq karqaku.
This argument continues to this day.	Kay rimayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
Now it sounds crazy.	Kunanqa loco hinam uyarikun.
They want to look good.	Allin rikchayniyuq kaytam munanku.
That really says something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas nin.
Nothing more, or less.	Mana imapas aswan, nitaq pisi.
Eat what you want to eat.	Mikhuy munasqaykita mikhuy.
I agree that that is important.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam acuerdopi kani.
Or a teacher.	Utaq huk yachachiq.
Probably smarter than him.	Yaqapaschá paymanta aswan yachaysapa.
It seemed just about time.	Chayqa tiempollanpi hinam rikchakurqa.
Almost there, but not quite.	Yaqa chaypi, ichaqa mana allintachu.
Who knows what happened.	Pitaq yachan imachus pasasqanmanta.
Head large and sad.	Uma hatun hinaspa llakisqa.
I didn't think anyone would.	Manam piensarqanichu pipas chayta ruwananta.
So far, he has refused to do so.	Kunankamaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
Nothing would be right again.	Manan imapas yapamanta allinchu kanman.
I'm not sure I'm good enough for you.	Manam segurochu kani qampaq ancha allin kasqaymanta.
That is, unless it’s a really good one.	Chayqa, mana chiqap allin kaq kaptinqa.
That wouldn’t be right for him.	Chayqa manan paypaq hinachu kanman.
John is absolutely correct.	Juanqa llapanpim allinta rimachkan.
He doesn’t live here.	Payqa manam kaypichu tiyan.
He was beautiful, you know.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, yachanki.
There should be the money.	Chaypin kanan chay qolqeta.
He had never been so sure.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina segurochu karqan.
He is no longer the same person.	Manañam kikin runachu.
But otherwise it is not true.	Ichaqa mana chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
Being a good young man.	Allin wayna kay.
It's actually bad actually.	Chiqaptaqa mana allinmi chiqaptaqa.
Faster or slower.	Aswan utqaylla utaq aswan pisi.
It didn't look safe.	Manam segurochu rikchakurqa.
That went well enough.	Chayqa allintam pasarqa.
Or go home.	Utaq wasiman riy.
And he talks about it.	Hinaspa chaymanta riman.
We get drunk a lot.	Achkatam machasqa kayku.
Yes, it was such a day.	Arí, chayna punchawmi karqa.
I couldn’t disagree.	Manam mana acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu.
Know who he is as a person.	Runa hina pi kasqanmanta yachay.
I mean, he's not always right.	Niyta munani, payqa manam sapa kutichu allinta rimachkan.
However, it was still very challenging.	Ichaqa, hinallam ancha sasachakuy karqa.
This, however, is not true.	Kayqa ichaqa manan cheqaqchu.
It was really very difficult.	Chiqaptam ancha sasa karqa.
It’s good to be here.	Kaypi kayqa allinmi.
But it’s only a matter of time.	Ichaqa pisi tiempollamantan.
He had an idea.	Payqa huk yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
I’m going to do the right thing.	Ñuqaqa allintam ruwasaq.
Never be without it.	Ama hayk’aqpas mana chaywanqa kaychu.
More importantly, it was funny.	Aswan allinqa, asikunapaq hinam karqa.
Anyway, he's right.	Imayna kaptinpas, payqa allintam rimachkan.
Being alone.	Sapallay kay.
That doesn’t sound like it.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu uyarikun.
And so terrified.	Hinaspa chayna mancharisqa.
You did a very good job today.	Kunan punchawmi ancha allin ruwayta ruwarqanki.
Not much of a day, really.	Mana ancha huk punchawchu, chiqaptapuni.
That’s what he told me to do.	Chaytam niwarqa ruwanaypaq.
You know .	Yachankim .
You are doing everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwachkanki.
It seemed a little too mysterious.	Chayqa huk chikan ancha pakasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
I never saw this coming.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kay hamunanta.
It seems so long ago now.	Kunanqa ancha unayñam rikchakun.
There’s just no time.	Chaylla mana tiempo kanchu.
He had no choice, he knew now.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, chaytan kunanqa yacharqan.
Very uncomfortable for me.	Ancha mana allinchu ñuqapaq.
I really, really, really wish I could.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, chiqamanta munayman.
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu.
He wanted to be important.	Payqa importante kaytan munarqan.
What a terrible child.	Ima manchay wawa.
But he couldn’t be.	Ichaqa manan kayta atirqanchu.
He wasn’t going to do it alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chayta ruwanan karqan.
Anyway, he continued.	Imayna kaptinpas hinallam nirqa.
He said he was the last.	Payqa qhepa kaqmi nispas nisqa.
That’s what everyone knows.	Chaynatam llapallanku yachanku.
Very good but so, very bad.	Ancha allin ichaqa chayna, ancha mana allin.
That’s what it does, though.	Chaytan ichaqa ruwan.
The next moment two things happened.	Qatiqnin rato iskay imapas pasarqa.
That’s all they were.	Chayllam paykunaqa karqaku.
I do hard things.	Sinchi ruwaykunata ruwani.
Now they were huge.	Kunanqa hatun hatunmi karqaku.
Not everyone is eager for the attention.	Manan llapa runachu anchata munanku chay qhawarisqa kayta.
I never noticed anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas repararqanichu.
What he says here is not true.	Kaypi nisqanqa manan cheqaqchu.
In fact, it was as if he had never been there.	Chiqaptaqa, mana haykapipas chaypi kaq hinam karqa.
He’s very, very good.	Payqa ancha ancha allinmi.
He actually seemed surprised.	Payqa chiqaptaqa admirasqa hinam karqa.
That’s kind of good.	Chayqa huk laya allinmi.
He seemed to live here.	Payqa kaypi tiyaq hinam karqa.
I can't take much.	Manam anchatachu hapiyta atiyman.
Which he never does.	Imatachus mana hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
Or, it should be anyway.	Utaq, imayna kaptinpas kanan.
That was always the case, she knew.	Chayqa sapa kutillanmi karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
I like him, he’s a great guy.	Paytaqa gustan, payqa hatun runam.
From this city.	Kay llaqtamanta.
I can’t wait to see more.	Mana suyayta atinichu astawan rikuyta.
What do they know about it.	Imatataq yachanku.
He knows things.	Payqa yachanmi imakunatapas.
Child, you know.	Wawa, yachanki.
But it is not	Ichaqa manan .
I really want to help.	Anchatam yanapayta munani.
That means you are a better person now.	Chayqa kunan aswan allin runa kasqaykita niyta munan.
The first day would have been better.	Ñawpaq p’unchay aswan allin kanman karqan.
He didn't seem right.	Payqa manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
He never said .	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas nirqanchu.
Almost every night now, in fact.	Yaqa sapa tuta kunan, chiqaptaqa.
I don’t want to think about it too much.	Manam anchatachu yuyaymanayta munani.
This thing was pretty big.	Kay imapas ancha hatunmi karqa.
He can’t sit here.	Payqa manan kaypi tiyayta atinchu.
Why why why.	Imarayku imarayku.
We had to act quickly.	Usqhaylla ruwanayku karqan.
But that’s the best way.	Ichaqa chay hinaqa aswan allinmi.
He does well at it.	Payqa allintam chaypi ruwan.
You are the new girl.	Chay musuq sipasmi kanki.
He seemed very serious.	Payqa ancha serio hinam karqa.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Sut’inmi kashan mana chay hinachu.
I think you’re smart.	Yuyaykuni yachaysapa kasqaykita.
He was in the hospital all day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi hospitalpi karqa.
Today was good and really fired up.	Kunan punchawqa allinmi karqa hinaspa chiqaptapuni qarqusqa karqa.
Be smarter than that.	Chaymanta aswan yachaysapa kay.
I am very depressed all the time.	Tukuy tiempon ancha llakisqa kashani.
You are like a human being.	Huk runa hinam kanki.
Here’s how you make this everyday meal.	Kaypi kay sapa p’unchaw mikhunata ruwanki.
That’s a good thing, folks.	Chayqa allinmi, runakuna.
Every player needs work.	Sapa pukllaqmi llamkayta necesitan.
So I’ll be proud of that.	Chaymi chay ruwasqaymanta orgulloso kasaq.
He didn’t want to see that happen.	Payqa manan chay pasananta rikuyta munarqanchu.
It shouldn’t be too difficult.	Mana ancha sasachu kanan.
One of them is this.	Hukninmi kay.
This is in three weeks.	Kayqa kimsa semanapi.
They probably want something from you.	Yaqapaschá qanmanta imatapas munanku.
Please, please.	Ama hina kaspa.
Now this is when.	Kunanqa kay haykapi.
He obviously loved it.	Payqa sut’inmi chayta anchata munarqan.
I prefer it that way anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas chaynatam aswan allinpaq hapini.
I have to be clear.	Sut’inmi kanay.
He didn’t think you would.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwanaykita.
This is the first thing you need to do.	Kaymi puntata ruwanayki.
However, that is ridiculous.	Ichaqa, chayqa asikunapaq hinam.
First of all, it wouldn’t work.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan allinchu kanman.
I doubt it ever will.	Iskayrayani haykapipas chayna kananta.
There’s no real me.	Manam chiqap ñuqaqa kanchu.
Fortunately he was.	Ancha kusisqa payqa karqan.
He’s not very good at it.	Payqa manan ancha allinchu chaypiqa.
I want to prevent that.	Chaytaqa hark’ayta munani.
I'm pretty sure, anyway.	Yaqa segurom kani, imayna kaptinpas.
I am always disappointed.	Sapa kutim hukmanyasqa kani.
And they know it.	Hinaspa paykunaqa yachanku.
But there is no one like him.	Ichaqa manan pipas pay hinaqa.
These are really really good.	Kaykunaqa chiqap chiqap allinmi.
He felt drunk.	Machasqa hinam tarikurqa.
It’s intelligent, it’s amazing.	Yuyayniyuqmi, admirakuypaqmi.
So it has to go.	Chaymi rinan.
You may not know.	Manapaschá yachankichu.
I wish you were with me.	Munaymanmi ñoqawan kasqaykita.
It gave me so much more.	Aswan achkatam quwarqa.
Great performance here.	Hatun ruway kaypi.
But yeah, nice guy.	Ichaqa arí, sumaq wayna.
I don’t think so.	Manam chaytachu yuyani.
I want to know the whole story.	Tukuy willayta yachayta munani.
You don’t want to eat there.	Manam chaypi mikuyta munankichu.
And then the other half tonight.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk kuskan kunan tuta.
Of course, it still takes time.	Arí, hinallam tiempota necesitan.
Talking can be really bad.	Rimayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanman.
And so he should.	Hinaspa chaynatam payqa ruwanan.
But it’s not that good.	Ichaqa manan chay hina allinchu.
If only he could make it.	Sichus chayman chayayta atinman karqan chayqa.
That it is not true.	Mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
She knew, he probably knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, payqa yaqapaschá yacharqan.
But that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan kunanqa chay hinachu.
He was very happy that night.	Chay tutaqa ancha kusisqam tarikurqa.
You look great today.	Kunan punchawmi ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq kanki.
You with us?.	Qam ñuqaykuwan?.
Boy, was it good.	Wayna, allinchu karqa.
Hopefully that happens this time.	Munaymanmi kay kutipi chayna kanman.
At the time, he had everything he wanted.	Chay tiempopiqa tukuy ima munasqanman hinam karqa.
Maybe too well.	Ichapas ancha allinta.
Really proud of him.	Chiqamanta paymanta orgulloso.
It was neither here nor there.	Manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu karqa.
Posted two days ago.	Iskay punchaw ñawpaqtaraqmi churasqa.
First of all, the characters were fantastic.	Ñawpaqtaqa, chaypi kaq runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku.
To anyone, no matter how famous.	Pimanpas, ancha riqsisqa kaptinpas.
It was better when he was alone anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas sapallan kaptinqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I didn’t do anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas ruwarqanichu.
I am a celebrity.	Ñuqaqa riqsisqa runam kani.
But in the end, that didn’t work.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
So this doesn't seem like a real world problem.	Chaymi kayqa mana chiqap pacha sasachakuy hinachu rikchakun.
Nothing so mean-spirited.	Mana imapas chayna millay yuyayniyuqchu.
I’m going to do this right.	Kayta allinta ruwasaq.
It just slipped out of me.	Chayllaraqmi ñuqamanta lluqsirqa.
It’s the latter.	Qhipa kaqmi.
People are not happy, they are angry.	Runakunaqa manan kusisqachu kanku, aswanpas phiñasqa kanku.
It’s really your favorite.	Chiqaptam qampa munasqayki.
I was the only good person.	Ñuqallam allin runa karqani.
Where there was one.	Maypichus huk kasqa.
No one wants that to happen to you.	Manan pipas munanmanchu chayta qanwan pasananta.
I still felt confused.	Hinallam mana yuyayniyuq hina tarikurqani.
There are people like you.	Qam hina runakunam kachkan.
He realized how vulnerable he really was.	Payqa repararqanmi cheqaqtapuni imayna mana allin qhawarisqa kasqanmanta.
I want to know how that feels.	Chay imayna sientekusqanmanta yachayta munani.
They will be, now, in this new world.	Paykunaqa kanqa, kunan, kay mosoq pachapi.
I need to be better than that.	Chaymanta aswan allin kaytam necesitasaq.
He didn't know that was the case.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chhayna kasqanmantaqa.
And now it was.	Hinaspa kunanqa karqan.
That says an awful lot.	Chayqa manchay achkatam nin.
Soon it would be night.	Pisi tiempollamantan tuta kanman.
I thought that was really, really cool.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
What a bad kid.	Ima mana allin wawa.
But I want this.	Ichaqa kaytam munani.
That was clearly a mistake.	Chayqa sut’inmi pantasqa karqan.
You know, always bigger.	Yachanki, sapa kuti aswan hatun.
That’s not always easy to do though.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu facil ruway ichaqa.
I’m afraid it’s there.	Manchakuni chaypi kasqanmanta.
He’s one of the best things he’s ever done.	Payqa hukninmi aswan allin ruwasqanmanta.
This was not meant to be.	Kayqa manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
It will be a little different.	Huk chikan chikan kanqa.
He didn’t seem nervous at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas mancharisqa hinachu karqan.
But I never really thought about that much before.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa anchatachu yuyaykurqani ñawpaqtaqa.
He is not seriously injured.	Payqa manan anchatachu k’irisqa kashan.
Be there to do this in the real world.	Chaypi kay chiqap pachapi ruwanapaq.
Here he is alone.	Kaypiqa sapallanmi.
Instead, he seemed happy.	Aswanpas kusisqa hinan kasharqan.
But this night he did.	Ichaqa kay tutan ruwarqan.
That is what he refused to do.	Chaytan payqa mana ruwayta munarqanchu.
I mean this is a lot.	Achka kaymi niyta munani.
It should have been a long time ago.	Unayñan kanan karqan.
No, certainly for him.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin paypaq.
Everyone knows this very, very well.	Kaytaqa llapa runam ancha, ancha allinta yachanku.
You don't want to see anyone get hurt.	Manan pitapas k'irisqa kananta rikuyta munankichu.
He was bigger than her.	Payqa paymanta aswan hatunmi karqan.
This was the first single.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq kaq sapallan.
It seemed overwhelming.	Chayqa sinchi hatunmi rikchakurqa.
So it does that.	Chaymi chaytaqa ruwan.
That was no, no.	Chayqa karqan manan, manan.
It all sounds all that great.	Tukuy chay tukuy chay hatun uyarikun.
That would have made sense.	Chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman karqa.
You’re pretty busy, after all.	Allin ocupasqa kanki, tukuy imamanta.
And this is what he meant.	Hinaspa kayna niyta munarqa.
But in the present day.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa.
I've never heard of this before.	Manam haykapipas kayta uyarirqanichu.
Worst time ever.	Aswan mana allin pacha hayk’aqpas.
It was so ridiculously easy here.	Kaypiqa ancha asikunapaq hina facilmi karqa.
I couldn’t go anywhere else.	Manañam maymanpas riyta atirqanichu.
That’s not really me.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu ñoqaqa.
He was angry and upset.	Payqa phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
But he refused to go there.	Ichaqa manan chaymanqa riyta munarqanchu.
Do it there, not here.	Chaypi ruway, ama kaypichu.
Maybe we both did that.	Ichapas iskayninku chayta ruwarqayku.
I will be your man.	Ñoqaqa qampa runam kasaq.
But otherwise, not really.	Ichaqa mana chayqa, manan cheqaqtachu.
I want it here.	Kaypim munani.
They were all here together.	Llapallankum kuska kaypi karqaku.
He seemed happy and carefree.	Payqa kusisqa mana llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Please, can you please.	Ama hina kaspa, ¿atiwaqchu.
And it just happened.	Hinaspa chayllaraq pasarqa.
Maybe it wasn’t me.	Ichapas mana ñuqachu karqani.
I never wanted to leave.	Manam haykapipas ripuyta munarqanichu.
Just feeling cold.	Chaylla chiri sientekusqanmanta.
You know how to talk.	Rimayta yachanki.
I didn’t know why, really.	Manam yacharqanichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
He’s obviously done this before.	Sut’inmi ñawpaqta kayta ruwarqan.
How to make the most of everything.	Imaynatataq tukuy imamanta astawan ruwana.
I just want to help.	Chaylla yanapayta munani.
You know you can't be like that.	Yachankim mana chayna kayta atisqaykita.
So, with us.	Chaymi, ñuqaykuwan kuska.
Much, much happier!.	¡Aswan, aswan kusisqa!.
That was the case last night.	Chayqa qayna tutam chayna karqa.
I feel so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi sientekuni.
He made a lot of money.	Achka qullqita ruwarqa.
You were hospitalized, more than once.	Hospitalpi churasqa karqanki, aswan huk kutita.
He obviously didn’t.	Sut’inmi kashan mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
This is the great thing about me.	Kaymi ñuqamanta hatun kaq.
What do you want to do first.	Imatataq ñawpaqta ruwayta munanki.
It was a harsh reality.	Chayqa sinchi cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
I'm pretty sure it's called that.	Yaqa segurom kani chay sutiyuq kasqanmanta.
Everyone knows exactly where they are.	Lliwmi allinta yachanku maypi kasqankuta.
This process was not very successful.	Kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu karqa.
Not anyway anyway.	Manaña imayna kaptinpas.
Obviously it was him.	Sut’inmi karqan paymi karqan.
Then the next one.	Chaymanta qatiqnin.
It was a wonderful day.	Chay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I hardly saw him.	Yaqapaschá mana paytaqa rikurqanichu.
Three times daily for two to three days.	Kimsa kuti sapa punchaw iskay kimsa punchaw.
It’s very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaqmi.
They are here now, in the world.	Paykunaqa kunan kaypi kachkanku, kay pachapi.
But he knew he would never do that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chay hinata ruwananta.
He was pretty much alone now.	Payqa kunanqa yaqa sapallanmi kasqa.
The man is a traveler.	Chay runaqa puriq runam.
It wasn’t bad or anything.	Manam mana allinchu nitaq imapas karqachu.
Not angry like that.	Mana phiñasqa chayna.
I don’t want to see him.	Manam payta rikuyta munanichu.
That would be thirty years later.	Chayqa kinsa chunka wata qhepamanmi kanman.
He said that it would be so.	Chayna kananpaqmi nirqa.
All kinds of that you can.	Tukuy laya chayta atisqaykita.
I can’t speak to you.	Manam rimayta atinichu.
I don’t understand why he would do that.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa chayta ruwananta.
Now tell me where it is.	Kunanqa willaway maypi kasqanmanta.
I could never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa atiymanchu karqa.
I am there every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaypi kachkani.
There, now he was outside.	Chaypi, kunanqa hawapi kasqa.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam.
These were such good people.	Kaykunaqa chayna allin runakunam karqaku.
So nothing really.	Chaymi mana imapas chiqaptaqa kanchu.
Better than he's ever been.	Aswan allin pay hayk'aqpas kasqanmanta.
It was lonely being outside.	Sapallanmi karqan hawapi kayqa.
And every night he refuses to sit there.	Hinaspa sapa tuta mana munanchu chaypi tiyayta.
He was quick, but there was something about him.	Payqa usqhayllan karqan, ichaqa imapas paywan kasharqan.
I have a new idea.	Ñuqaqa huk musuq yuyayniyuqmi kani.
But he wants to.	Ichaqa munanmi.
Other than that, nothing.	Huk chaymanta, mana imapas.
I don’t want to go outside.	Manam hawaman lluqsiyta munanichu.
The worst thing that ever happened to him.	Aswan millay imapas paywan pasasqanmanta.
Something very strange happened.	Imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
You want to be like him.	Pay hina kaytam munanki.
He was just as bad as she was.	Payqa pay hinam mana allinchu karqa.
I just know there are a lot of them.	Chaylla yachani achka kasqanmanta.
In fact, nothing is always better.	Aswanpas manan imapas sapa kutichu aswan allinqa.
It still needs a lot of work though.	Hinallam achka llamkayta necesitan ichaqa.
I wish I had.	Munaymanmi kanman karqan.
I had no idea which way to go.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani mayqin ñanta rinaypaq.
But it was a long time ago now.	Ichaqa unayñan kunanqa karqan.
But it will be the latter.	Ichaqa qhepa kaqmi kanqa.
I'll do it again tomorrow.	Paqarinmi yapamanta ruwasaq.
Then again, maybe it was.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas chayna karqa.
Can’t say too much.	Mana llumpayta niyta atinchu.
But that would be later.	Ichaqa chayqa qhepamanmi kanman.
He can’t leave.	Payqa manan ripuyta atinmanchu.
It was a senior week.	Kuraq semanan karqan.
Everything came out in the end.	Tukuy imapas tukukuypi lluqsirqa.
But that doesn’t matter here.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan kaypiqa imananpaschu.
It just had to be.	Chaylla kanan karqa.
Yes, that month.	Arí, chay killa.
I hope to do that in the summer.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi suyachkani chiri tiempopi.
I was a mystery.	Huk pakasqa kaqmi karqani.
He had been depressed for a long time.	Payqa unayñan llakisqa kasharqan.
We've done all that work.	Tukuy chay llamk'ayta ruwarqayku.
Tell them what feels good and what doesn’t.	Willay imakuna allin sientekusqanmanta, imakuna mana allin kasqanmanta.
It’s really dark but beautiful.	Chiqamanta yana ichaqa sumaq.
It’s really hard to do.	Cheqaqtapunin sasa ruwayqa.
How it was there in the end.	Imaynatataq chaypi karqan tukukuypi.
Yes, that would be a bad thing.	Arí, chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
Where did he go.	Mayman rirqa.
He should have done that three years ago.	Chaytaqa kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanan karqa.
I don’t really know what it’s like.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna kasqanmanta.
This was a really awesome day.	Kayqa chiqap manchay punchawmi karqa.
Say it once and for all.	Huk kutilla niy.
But the truth is out there.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi hawapi kashan.
So this is a big deal.	Chaymi kayqa hatun ruwaymi.
That would have been bigger than him.	Chayqa paymanta aswan hatunmi kanman karqan.
He was really good, really talented.	Payqa chiqap allinmi karqa, chiqap yachaysapa.
I wish you would do it soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla ruwanaykita.
I've seen it all the time before.	Ñawpaqtaqa sapa kutim rikurqani.
Now, there was no reason.	Kunanqa, manan imaraykupas karqanchu.
This one does that perfectly.	Kayqa chaytaqa allintam ruwan.
Be sure of that.	Chaymanta seguro kay.
But he can’t figure out what to do about the problem.	Ichaqa manan yuyaymanayta atinchu chay sasachakuymanta ima ruwananta.
He asked me about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta tapuwarqa.
He is terrified of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kachkan.
No one is alone here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas sapallanchu kachkan.
No, do those things.	Manan, chay ruwaykunata ruway.
But that was a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinmi karqan.
Maybe I can give it a go.	Ichapas huk kutita ruwayta atiyman.
He doesn’t seem angry or sad at all.	Manam phiñasqa nitaq llakisqa hinachu ni imapipas.
I always thought that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa piensarqani.
I almost can’t believe it.	Yaqa mana creeyta atinichu.
They are good people.	Paykunaqa allin runakunam.
I want to hear things like people do.	Runakuna hinam imatapas uyariyta munani.
He said it was none of my business.	Paymi nirqa mana ñuqapa ruwanay kasqanmanta.
He needs something from me.	Paymi ñuqamanta imatapas necesitan.
That’s what I thought, too.	Chaynatam ñuqapas piensarqani.
It was really cold.	Chiqamanta sinchi chiri karqa.
That one needs some work.	Chay hukninmi wakin llamkayta necesitan.
One man was very tired.	Huk runam ancha sayk’usqa tarikurqa.
You know it never happened.	Yachanki mana haykapipas chayna kasqanmanta.
Nothing else much.	Mana imapas huk anchatachu.
He did remarkably well there.	Chaypiqa admirakuypaqmi allinta ruwarqa.
I certainly do that.	Chiqamanta chayta ruwani.
The ??? 	Chay ???
it is not worth anything.	mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Then you keep going.	Chaymantaqa hinallam rinki.
Not a day off.	Mana huk punchawchu.
Really, all sorts.	Chiqamanta, tukuy laya.
Tomorrow would do better.	Paqarinmi aswan allinta ruwanman.
We are anonymous people.	Mana sutiyuq runakunam kanchik.
I'm just disappointed.	Chayllaraqmi hukmanyasqa kachkani.
So time passed by.	Chaymi tiempo pasarqa.
That would have been him.	Chayqa paymi kanman karqan.
He was a very nice, very talented man.	Payqa ancha sumaq, ancha yachaysapa runam karqa.
I couldn’t really say anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
Everything in the world.	Kay pachapi tukuy ima.
I was very uncomfortable.	Anchatam mana allinchu karqani.
More than this.	Aswan kaymanta.
Who just did that.	Pitaq chayllaraq chayta ruwarqa.
That's good .	Chayqa, allinmi .
A real child.	Chiqap wawa.
He was immediately in trouble.	Chayllam sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
The real me, that is.	Chiqap ñuqa, chaymi.
He says it’s okay.	Payqa allinmi nin.
He was finally with her, alone.	Payqa tukukuypi paywan kasqa, sapallan.
Now you want one.	Kunanqa hukta munanki.
Something more beautiful.	Imapas aswan sumaq.
Today was amazing.	Kunan punchawqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I am not a human being.	Manam runa runachu kani.
But it is very unfortunate.	Ichaqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
You never know, really.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu, chiqaptaqa.
Again it was amazing.	Yapamanta admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Eat what you can tolerate.	Mikhuy imachus aguantayta atisqaykita.
There is no set process.	Manam kanchu huk churasqa ruway.
You will do it one day.	Huk punchawmi ruwanki.
That was the other guy.	Chayqa karqan huknin wayna.
But he wanted to be alone.	Ichaqa sapallan kaytam munarqa.
As long as he can.	Atisqanman hina unayta.
Okay, that’s what it is.	Allinmi, chaymi imapas.
That's actually not that good.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa manam chayna allinchu.
Second, nothing else.	Iskay kaq, mana imapas.
So it may not be true.	Chaymi manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
So it is not quick and easy.	Chaymi mana utqaylla hinaspa mana sasa ruwaychu.
So, yeah, there you go.	Chaymi, arí, chaypi rinki.
Everyone wants to have an opinion.	Lliwmi munanku huk yuyayniyuq kayta.
He can barely talk.	Payqa yaqapaschá rimayta atin.
Surely, it would be a better approach.	Chiqamanta, aswan allin ruway kanman.
There’s something there for you.	Chaypim kan qampaq.
No one ever asked him to do that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwananpaqqa hayk’aqpas nirqanchu.
This is the new me.	Kaymi musuq ñuqa.
Maybe you do, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki, ichapas mana.
It wasn't meant to be, but it did.	Manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa, ichaqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
I certainly didn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana ruwarqanichu.
Blacker than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan yana.
I was like graceful.	Ñuqaqa gracias hinam karqani.
I was the best.	Ñuqaqa aswan allinmi karqani.
I think there is a problem somewhere in the world.	Yuyaykuni maypipas kay pachapi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
I don't know if you know.	Mana yachanichu yachanki icha manachu.
He was very serious about it.	Payqa anchatam chaymantaqa serio karqa.
That's one of the things he can't do.	Chayqa hukninmi mana atisqanmanta.
I had no time to do more.	Manam tiempoy karqachu astawan ruwanaypaq.
Rather who this was.	Aswanpas pichus kay karqan.
He would be alone there otherwise.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi kanman mana chayqa.
That made the game.	Chayqa chay pukllayta ruwarqa.
But he is not as angry as I am.	Ichaqa manan ñoqawan hinachu phiñasqa kashan.
Where is it located? 	Maypitaq kachkan?
It’s always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
Some people are.	Wakin runakunaqa.
Probably the latter is true.	Yaqapaschá kay qhepa kaq cheqaq.
No, it’s very important.	Manan, ancha importante.
One though.	Huk ichaqa.
That means a lot, actually.	Chayqa anchatam niyta munan, chiqaptaqa.
If the following is correct.	Kay qatiqnin allin kaptinqa.
Now, actually.	Kunanqa, chiqaptaqa.
I can’t believe it.	Mana creeyta atinichu.
But he never really knew that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa allintachu yacharqan.
I think about that sometimes.	Chaypin wakin kutipi yuyaykuni.
You may not agree with him.	Manapaschá paywan acuerdopichu kanki.
I’m sorry this happened.	Pampachaykuway kay pasasqanmanta.
One is the past.	Hukninmi ñawpaq tiempo.
That is every day of every week of the year.	Chayqa sapa wata sapa semana sapa punchawmi.
Glad we did that.	Kusisqam chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I’m not at all sure he did.	Manam imapipas segurochu kani chay ruwasqanmanta.
On a regular basis.	Sapa kutilla.
This is what this is about.	Kayqa chaymantam rimachkan.
It meant so much.	Anchatan niyta munarqan.
But, like anything else, it’s a process.	Ichaqa, imapas hina, chayqa ruwaymi.
But I was the only one.	Ichaqa ñuqallam karqani.
I am not sure if it is.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Learn to say the truth for you.	Qanpaq cheqaq kaqta niyta yachay.
You’re going to be the same.	Qampas chayna kanki.
He didn’t want that anymore.	Payqa manañan chayta munarqanchu.
He didn’t really want to know.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yachayta munarqan.
So there’s a lot there.	Chaymi chaypiqa achka kachkan.
I think he’s yours.	Payqa qanpa kaqmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
Is it the time? 	¿Chay pacha?
He could not know these things.	Chaykunataqa manam yachayta atirqachu.
Maybe that wasn’t good enough for me.	Ichapas chayqa mana allinchu karqa ñuqapaq.
He can do this quickly, too.	Payqa kayta usqhaylla ruwanman, chaymanta.
He knew how to go.	Riyta yacharqa.
You are doing it all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwachkanki.
Maybe he just couldn’t believe it.	Ichapas payqa mana creeyta atirqachu.
I don't ever want that to happen.	Manam haykapipas chayna kananta munanichu.
I have no idea, actually.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani, chiqaptaqa.
A nice one, actually.	Huk sumaq, chiqaptaqa.
Like, seriously though.	Imayna, serio ichaqa.
There is a restaurant there.	Chaypin huk mikhuy wasi kan.
Something this absurd.	Imapas kay mana yuyayniyuq.
And, well, you’re one of the biggest .	Hinaspa, allinmi, qanmi kanki huknin hatun .
But it was very easy to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa ancha facilmi karqa.
I can’t say too much.	Manam anchatachu niyta atiyman.
He wants to be better.	Payqa aswan allin kaytam munan.
Still, he could do nothing about it.	Chayna kaptinpas manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu chaykunataqa.
I feel the same way, kind of.	Ñuqapas chaynatam sientekuni, imayna.
I certainly think so.	Chiqamanta chayta yuyani.
So he came to the table.	Chaymi payqa hamurqa.
Today would be nice, okay.	Kunan punchawqa sumaqmi kanman, allinmi.
I tried to convince him not to do that.	Chayta mana ruwananpaqmi convencechiyta munarqani.
But he was bigger than you.	Ichaqa qanmanta aswan hatunmi karqan.
Say his name.	Sutinta niy.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas kanan hinam kachkan.
He wanted to be in his own home.	Payqa kikin wasinpi kaytam munarqa.
Anyway, this was great.	Imayna kaptinpas, kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
So far, this has been the best.	Kunankamaqa kaymi aswan allin karqa.
But he said a lot.	Ichaqa achkatam nirqa.
I think he might be a little angry.	Yuyaykuni huk chhikanta phiñasqa kanman.
So he was happy to be there.	Chaymi payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
I don’t know how or why.	Mana yachanichu imaynata, imarayku.
If you want it, that’s it.	Sichus munanki chayqa, chaymi.
It’s not always good.	Manan sapa kutichu allin.
That probably didn't seem right.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu rikchakurqa.
No one knew the answer.	Manan pipas kutichiyta yacharqanchu.
That wouldn’t have worked.	Chaywanqa manan allinchu kanman karqan.
You don’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yachankichu.
That's going to be really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanqa.
Why did this happen?	Imanasqataq chayna pasarqa.
It’s all very important to be good.	Tukuy ancha allinmi allin kay.
I know how to get there.	Chayman chayayta yachani.
Go on, do tell.	Riy, ruway willay.
He didn’t want to stay.	Payqa manan qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
He didn’t seem nervous.	Payqa manan mancharisqa hinachu karqan.
He wished he wasn’t so tired.	Payqa mana chayna sayk’usqa kananta munarqa.
Maybe he’s smart.	Ichapas payqa yachaysapa kachkan.
There was no head injury.	Manam karqachu uma k’irisqa kasqanmanta.
Yes, that was a tragedy.	Arí, chayqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Perhaps that is not simple or easy.	Yaqapaschá chayqa manan facilchu nitaq facilchu.
But they were there for a while.	Ichaqa huk tiempon chaypi karqanku.
I wasn't surprised when he wasn't there.	Mana chaypi kaptinqa manam admirakurqanichu.
I would be very big.	Ancha hatunmi kayman.
This is something that really needs to be done.	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwana.
The local people are great.	Chay llaqtapi runakunaqa ancha allinmi.
Someone told me that this was correct.	Pipas niwarqa kay nisqanqa allin kasqanmanta.
I feel comfortable doing that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi allinta sientekuni.
I want it there.	Chaypim munani.
We did a story about it last week.	Qayna semanan chaymanta huk willakuyta ruwarqayku.
Maybe he always was.	Ichapas payqa sapa kutilla karqa.
It wasn't that hard for him.	Manam chayna sasachu karqa paypaq.
He is doing really well.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allinta ruwashan.
But now it’s okay.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi.
This second approach is more interesting.	Kay iskay kaq ruwayqa aswan sumaqmi.
I mean what it is.	Niyta munani imachus kasqanmanta.
Yes, he was alone.	Arí, payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
I didn’t have any other idea.	Manam huk yuyayniyuqchu karqani.
Here’s how to do it right.	Kaypi imaynatachus allinta ruwana.
He said it was a big deal.	Payqa hatun ruway kasqanmantam nirqa.
But it was nice, you know.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqan, yachanki.
And two together the here where the .	Hinaspa iskay kuska chay kaypi maypichus chay .
Wherever that may be.	Maypipas chay kaptinpas.
That would have been it.	Chayqa kanman karqan.
You will have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki kanqa.
Yes, you were right.	Arí, allintam nirqanki.
He probably thought it was funny.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa asikunapaq hinata yuyaykurqan.
He knew it was coming, eventually.	Payqa yacharqanmi hamunanta, qhepaman.
They were mad and angry.	Paykunaqa loco, phiñasqa karqanku.
Yeah, a good guy.	Arí, allin wayna.
A year older than me.	Ñoqamanta huk wata kuraq.
These people are	Chay runakunaqa .
But it is likely that .	Ichaqa yaqapaschá .
So here is what it looks like.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan imayna kasqanmanta.
That stuff is easy.	Chay imapas facilmi.
But you’re just like me.	Ichaqa ñoqa hinallam kanki.
If it’s not good enough, it’s not good enough.	Mana allin kaptinqa mana allinchu.
It can’t be this.	Mana kayta atinchu.
You have him all the time.	Tukuy tiempon paytaqa kanki.
It wasn’t safe at all.	Manan imapipas segurochu karqan.
Or somewhere about it.	Utaq maypipas chaymanta.
That’s why this is going to happen.	Chayraykum kayqa kanqa.
Now, he was great.	Kunanqa, payqa hatunmi karqan.
I'm always here.	Sapa kutim kaypi kachkani.
Thanks, hope to hear from you sooner.	Gracias, suyachkani uyariyta aswan utqaylla.
I had a lot of trouble with it.	Chaywanmi achka sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
I feel better too.	Ñuqapas allintam sientekuni.
He wanted some understanding.	Payqa munarqanmi wakin entiendeyta.
That was a huge failure.	Chayqa huk hatun mana ruwaymi karqan.
I'll do it.	Ñoqaqa ruwasaq.
It’s really hard.	Chiqaptam sinchi.
Very, very easy.	Ancha, ancha facil.
But that doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
But seriously, though.	Ichaqa serio, ichaqa.
But he did his best.	Ichaqa tukuy atisqanman hinan ruwarqan.
I am not sure if that is correct or not.	Manam segurochu kani chay allin kasqanmanta utaq mana kasqanmanta.
No one was in the car when he did.	Chayta ruwaptinqa manam pipas carropi karqachu.
He wants to look good.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq kaytam munan.
That wasn’t true here.	Chayqa manan kaypiqa cheqaqchu karqan.
It was like last time.	Qayna kuti hinam karqa.
He seemed really upset.	Payqa chiqap phiñasqa hinam karqa.
I mean really awesome.	Chiqamanta manchay niyta munani.
And so it all happened.	Hinaspa chaynatam tukuy imapas pasarqa.
He will go every day.	Sapa punchawmi rinqa.
Too much, every week.	Llumpay, sapa semana.
One last chance.	Huk qhipa chansa.
If true, that's not very good.	Chiqap kaptinqa, chayqa manam ancha allinchu.
I wonder about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta tapukuni.
He wants to be someone else.	Payqa huk runa kaytam munan.
She knew it was funny, but she was worried.	Payqa yacharqanmi asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta, ichaqa llakisqa kasharqan.
Don’t do anything you don’t want to do.	Ama imatapas ruwaychu mana ruwayta munaspaqa.
If yes, that’s fine.	Sichus arí, allinmi.
Yes, he is sick.	Arí, unqusqa kachkan.
You know, before .	Yachanki, manaraq .
You’ll be all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi kanki.
But, a couple of things.	Ichaqa, huk iskay imakuna.
That doesn’t really do it.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwan.
I don’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creenichu.
He’s better off without me.	Payqa aswan allinmi mana ñoqawanqa.
He wanted a chance to talk to her.	Payqa munarqanmi huk oportunidadta paywan rimananpaq.
He was human, once.	Payqa runam karqa, huk kuti.
I never knew who did it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu pikuna chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Right now, today.	Kunanpacha, kunan punchaw.
He was nervous with me, why not.	Payqa ñoqawanmi mancharisqa kasharqan, imaraykutaq mana.
Some people don’t care.	Wakin runakunaqa manan imananpaschu.
I can’t not be there.	Manam mana chaypi kayta atiymanchu.
I don't want to do it here.	Kaypiqa manam ruwayta munanichu.
If it’s good, well it’s all well and good.	Allin kaptinqa, allinmi tukuy imapas allin hinaspa allin.
I was never sure about that.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa segurochu karqani.
And now this way.	Hinaspa kunan kay ñanta.
Not sure where.	Mana segurochu maypi.
I couldn’t believe him.	Manam paytaqa creeyta atirqanichu.
Actually more than one.	Chiqaptaqa aswan hukmanta.
It wasn’t funny at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
Instead, make it funny.	Aswanpas asikunapaq hina ruway.
Do this and you will be disappointed.	Kayta ruway hinaspa hukmanyasqa kanki.
One of the secrets.	Huk pakasqa kasqanmanta.
He wants to talk to her.	Paywan rimayta munan.
Maybe he’s difficult.	Ichapas payqa sasa kanman.
They know that here in prison.	Chaytaqa yachanku kaypi carcelpi.
But don’t be this.	Ichaqa ama kaychu.
One of the players said so.	Huknin pukllaqmi chayta nirqa.
Disappointed that it was gone.	Hukmanyasqa chaymi manaña karqachu.
I really wanted to win this.	Kayta atipayta anchata munarqani.
Great, that’s better.	Hatun, chayqa aswan allinmi.
She’s afraid of him.	Payqa manchakunmi payta.
I’m surprised by everything.	Admirasqa kani tukuy imamanta.
I couldn’t get used to it.	Manam chaymanqa yachayta atirqanichu.
We haven’t been this happy in a long time.	Unayñan mana kay hina kusisqachu kayku.
He wanted to.	Munarqa.
Okay, nothing wrong.	Allinmi, manam imapas mana allinchu.
This uncertainty is overwhelming.	Kay mana seguro kayqa sinchi hatunmi.
He can't believe she's not here.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu mana kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
He's right there.	Payqa chaypiqa allintam kachkan.
So give it a try.	Chaymi huk kutita ruway.
I knew how to do it.	Yacharqanim imayna ruwayta.
It’s probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá kanman.
Wherever you were.	Maypichus karqanki.
It was actually pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa allin allinmi karqa.
It was going to be a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi kanan karqa.
There was no moon.	Manam killa karqachu.
It’s not good otherwise.	Mana allinchu mana chayqa.
A strange thing.	Huk mana riqsisqa kaq.
They both know.	Iskayninkum yachanku.
Here it was found.	Kaypiqa tarikurqa.
Okay, that makes no sense.	Allinmi, chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
Hopefully it will go through with it.	Munaymanmi chaywan pasananta.
He was angry about it.	Chaywanmi phiñasqa kasharqan.
Maybe there were twenty.	Ichapas iskay chunka karqa.
No one plans to do that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwaytaqa yuyaykunchu.
But now, I'd rather it didn't happen.	Ichaqa kunanqa, aswan allinmi kanman mana chay pasananta.
That’s what I’ve been thinking about all the time.	Chaypin sapa kutilla yuyaykurqani.
First crazy ten years ago.	Ñawpaqta loco chunka wata ñawpaqta.
Sounds like a lot.	Achka hinam uyarikun.
I’m rather tired at the moment.	Aswan sayk’usqañan kashani kunan tiempopi.
I am impressed and impressed.	Ñuqaqa admirasqa hinaspa admirasqa kachkani.
He may not be able to get out.	Manapaschá lluqsiyta atinmanchu.
He wouldn’t want to go there.	Mana chayman riyta munanmanchu.
Anyone can do it wrong.	Pipas mana allintachu ruwanman.
People are beautiful.	Runakunaqa sumaqmi kanku.
There's a good chance it will.	Allin chansa kanmi chayna kananpaq.
There was no one there yet.	Chaypiqa manaraqmi pipas karqachu.
He says he doesn't really know what to do.	Paymi nin ima ruwananmanta mana allintachu yachasqanmanta.
That’s all about him.	Chayllam paymanta kachkan.
You're seriously injured.	Sinchi k'irisqa kanki.
He thought about what he had done.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruwasqanpi.
Maybe so, but probably not.	Ichapas chayna kanman, ichaqa manapaschá.
I wasn't sure about it anymore.	Manañam chaymantaqa segurochu karqani.
They are not the right fit for you.	Paykunaqa manan qanpaq hinachu kanku.
And a sure thing.	Hinaspa huk seguro kaq.
You can’t come with me.	Manam ñuqawanqa hamuyta atiwaqchu.
He was yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
This may seem silly, but it works.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam kanman, ichaqa allinmi.
We can never be happy again.	Manañam haykapipas kusisqa kayta atichwanchu.
And he’s the one.	Hinaspa payqa chay.
Amazingly, it still sounds like all the time.	Admirakuypaqmi, kunankamapas tukuy tiempopi hinam uyarikun.
No one really knew what happened.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yacharqan imachus pasasqanmanta.
Beautiful restaurant.	Sumaq mikhuy wasi.
This makes more sense.	Kayqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi.
Then, all seriously.	Chaymanta, tukuy serio.
But it doesn’t look very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu rikch’akun.
It looked busy.	Chayqa ocupasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
These are the .	Kaykunaqa chay .
He could have made it harder.	Aswan sinchitan ruwanman karqan.
The first one was a few months ago.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan iskay kinsa killa ñawpaqta.
I can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
That said a lot about him.	Chayqa anchatam paymanta nirqa.
Of course, it’s not the only thing.	Arí, manan chayllachu.
Very very very ugly.	Ancha ancha ancha millay.
I want to, too.	Ñuqapas munani.
If things work out.	Sichus imapas allin kanman chayqa.
You’re not like you.	Manam qam hinachu kanki.
It makes a lot of sense now.	Kunanqa ancha yuyayniyuqmi.
You did the right thing.	Qamqa allintam ruwasqaykita ruwarqanki.
He’s both of them.	Payqa iskayninkun.
Goodnight, everyone.	Allin tuta, llapa runa.
Probably nothing is right.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas allinchu.
It was somewhere.	Maypipas karqa.
I really agree with him.	Chiqaptam paywan kuska kachkani.
They were both there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa iskayninkum chaypi karqaku.
He stayed here for about a week.	Payqa huk semana hinan kaypi qhepakurqan.
Please forgive me for not doing so.	Ama hina kaspa, pampachaykuway mana chayta ruwasqaymanta.
He always acted like her.	Payqa sapa kutim pay hina ruwaq.
It just seemed right.	Chayraqmi allinpaq rikchakurqa.
He had no idea what would happen next.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus chaymanta pasananta.
I’m not sure it’s right for me.	Manam segurochu kani allinchu ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
I don't believe he did.	Manam creenichu chay ruwasqanqa.
Instead, they’re injured.	Aswanpas k’irisqa kanku.
But not if there is a problem.	Ichaqa manan sichus sasachakuy kanqa chayqa.
She really wanted to be with him.	Payqa anchatam munarqa paywan kayta.
He told me you were here.	Paymi niwarqa kaypi kasqaykita.
Something had to be done quickly.	Imatapas usqhayllan ruwana karqan.
He wanted to be me.	Payqa ñuqa kaytam munarqa.
But there is one fact.	Ichaqa huk cheqaq kaqmi kan.
He never really was.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu karqan.
Still the same problem.	Hinallam chayna sasachakuy.
This is the second one.	Kayqa iskay kaqmi.
I don’t feel like that person or anything.	Manam chay runa hinachu nitaq imapas hinachu sientekuni.
It didn't look like he was hurt.	Manas k'irisqa hinachu kasqa.
Yes, that was a long time ago.	Arí, chayqa unayñan karqan.
No one knows anything about anything.	Manan pipas imamantapas imamantapas imatapas yachanchu.
He never wanted to talk to her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas paywan rimayta munarqanchu.
The child in prison.	Carcelpi kaq wawa.
It’s very difficult to be here.	Ancha sasam kaypi kayqa.
What is the right thing to do?.	¿Imatataq ruwananchik?.
No one should ever have to do this alone.	Manan hayk’aqpas pipas sapallan chaytaqa ruwananchu.
He will always be with me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqawan kanqa.
He’s not sure about me.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan ñoqamanta.
But anyway, yeah.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas, arí.
So all of this was out there.	Chaymi tukuy kaykunaqa hawapi karqa.
There are three steps.	Kimsa ruwaymi kan.
Why, they .	Imarayku, paykunaqa .
Again he knew there was nothing he could do.	Yapamanta yacharqa mana ima ruwaytapas atisqanmanta.
So he did a really bad job.	Chaymi cheqaqtapuni mana allin llank’ayta ruwarqan.
And for a while, that was it.	Hinaspa huk rato, chaymi karqan.
This wasn’t like him, not at all.	Kayqa manan pay hinachu karqan, manan imapipas.
It just seemed like a smart move.	Chayqa huk yachaysapa ruway hinallam rikchakurqa.
He was bigger than that now.	Payqa kunanqa chaymanta aswan hatunmi kasqa.
We have a lot to do together.	Achkatam kuska ruwananchikpaq kachkan.
I was really in a bit of trouble.	Chiqaptam huk chikan sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
Anyway, this is great.	Imayna kaptinpas, kayqa ancha allinmi.
You don’t want to go there.	Manam chaymanqa riyta munankichu.
One had to be reasonable.	Hukninmi allin yuyayniyuq kanan karqa.
This would be the best way.	Kaymi aswan allinqa kanman.
Nothing new there then.	Mana imapas musuq chaypi chaymantaqa.
Now we are really unsure.	Kunanqa chiqaptam mana segurochu kanchik.
The man does better.	Chay runaqa aswan allintam ruwan.
That doesn’t matter though.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu ichaqa.
He left a few hours ago.	Payqa iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi lluqsirqa.
Good morning, good morning.	Allin p'unchaw, allin p'unchaw.
It was very lonely.	Chayqa ancha sapallanmi karqa.
Bigger and bigger.	Aswan hatun hinaspa hatun.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t be alone.	Mana chayqa, manas sapallanchu kanman.
But, actually, it was good.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa, allinmi karqa.
After that, more steps would have to be taken.	Chay qhepamanmi aswan askha ruwaykunata ruwana kanman.
But there is a big drawback.	Ichaqa hatun mana allin ruwaymi kan.
It is important to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayqa ancha allinmi.
But always happy.	Ichaqa sapa kuti kusisqa.
And we’re tougher.	Hinaspa aswan sinchi kayku.
I really don't know what to think about this.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu kaymanta ima yuyaymanayta.
I am very disappointed with that.	Chaywanmi anchata hukmanyasqa kachkani.
He seemed very happy about it.	Payqa chaymanta ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
The truth was not so good.	Cheqaq kaqmi ichaqa mana ancha allinchu karqan.
He tried to stop her but couldn’t.	Payqa hark’ayta munarqan ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
That you didn’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwasqaykita.
He doesn’t know, not yet.	Payqa manam yachanchu, manaraqmi.
That means he is home.	Chayqa wasinpi kasqanmantam niyta munan.
Who you used to be.	Pichus ñawpaqta karqanki.
Every sentence is a milestone.	Sapa rimayqa huk hatun ruwaymi.
He would like to live in this house.	Payqa kay wasipi tiyayta munanman.
They weren’t serious enough.	Paykunaqa manan allintachu serio karqanku.
Not a time like today.	Mana kunan hina pacha.
Don't, he says.	Ama, nispas nin.
It doesn’t have that.	Manam chaytaqa kanchu.
It does work here and there.	Kaypi chaypi llamk’ayta ruwan.
He went according to his will.	Munasqanman hinam rirqa.
Tell me how you did it.	Imayna ruwasqaykita willaway.
We disagree all the time.	Tukuy tiempon mana acuerdopichu kayku.
He said nothing the whole time.	Tukuy tiempon mana imatapas nirqanchu.
Then one night.	Chaymanta huk tuta.
He said that would not happen to him.	Payqa nirqam chayna mana paypaq pasananta.
That’s the only thing that’s good.	Chayllam allinqa.
He has to do what he has to do’.	Ima ruwananta ruwanan tiyan’.
Everything else	Tukuy imapas .
I thought that was a pretty big deal.	Chaytaqa ancha hatun ruwaymi nispan yuyaykurqani.
Do the job right for him.	Paypaq allinta chay llamkayta ruway.
Is there a way to do it.	¿Kanchu imayna ruwanapaq.
Unfortunately, he took it out.	Llakikuypaqmi chaymanta hurqurqa.
Maybe they all are.	Ichapas llapallanku chayna kanku.
I can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwaymanchu.
Something happened there.	Chaypim imapas pasarqa.
I was all over the place.	Tukuy chaypim karqani.
If the house is cold, it’s fine.	Wasi chiri kaptinqa allinmi.
So that’s what he said.	Chaymi chay nispa.
They were all hungry.	Llapallankum yarqasqa karqaku.
I know otherwise it is true.	Yachanim mana chayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
But yes, he is here.	Ichaqa arí, payqa kaypim kachkan.
I could never say those things.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa niyta atirqanichu.
But it was really hard to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa karqan chayta ruwayqa.
It was faster.	Aswan utqayllam karqa.
Maybe he was really disappointed.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni hukmanyasqa karqa.
Obviously I've done something wrong.	Sut'inmi imapas mana allin ruwasqayta.
Many people learn this the hard way.	Achka runakunam kayta yachanku sasa ñanta.
Everyone is good.	Lliwmi allin kanku.
But he is always curious.	Ichaqa sapa kutim yachayta munan.
This is not like me.	Kayqa manam ñuqa hinachu.
He’s the cold one.	Payqa chiri kaqmi.
Later ,	Qhepamanmi .
So and so and so.	Chayna hinaspa chayna.
After that he was hungry.	Chay qhepamanmi yarqasqa kasharqan.
That’s actually a very difficult thing to do.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
There are a lot of people.	Achka runakunam.
Now it could be soon.	Kunanqa pisi tiempollamantan kanman.
So, you’re fired.	Chaymi, qarqusqa kanki.
It was a traveler.	Chayqa huk puriq runam karqa.
That would have been better.	Chayna kaptinqa aswan allinmi kanman karqa.
I don’t always agree.	Manam sapa kutichu acuerdopi kani.
I don’t have a name.	Mana sutiyuq kani.
I think it's wrong.	Ñuqaqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
That is certainly a good thing.	Cheqaqtapunin chayqa allin.
He’s going to do it.	Payqa chayta ruwanqa.
Maybe more, actually.	Ichapas aswan, chiqaptaqa.
If you really think about it.	Sichus cheqaqtapuni chayta yuyaykunki chayqa.
It was about one o'clock in the morning.	Huk hora tutamanta hinam karqa.
I wasn’t the only one who heard it.	Manam ñuqallachu uyarirqani.
It would be surprising if it didn't.	Admirakuypaqmi kanman mana chayna kaptinqa.
No one knows exactly why this happened.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan imarayku chay pasasqanmanta.
If you do, it will stop working.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa manañan allintachu ruwanqa.
Hopefully not too long.	Munaymanmi mana ancha unaytachu.
So, no thanks.	Chaymi, mana gracias.
Everyone seemed busy.	Lliwmi ocupasqa hina karqaku.
I think it’s a treasure.	Yuyaykuni huk qhapaq kay kananpaq.
But now he wanted to leave.	Ichaqa kunanmi ripuyta munarqa.
He can’t do it right.	Mana allin ruwayta atinchu.
He was already like that.	Payqa ñam chayna karqa.
This had to happen now.	Kayqa kunanmi kanan karqa.
This is the best thing about tonight.	Kaymi kunan tutamanta aswan allinqa.
I want to do it right.	Allintam ruwayta munani.
But that is not a good thing.	Ichaqa chay nisqanqa manan allinchu.
Even so, it will not be good.	Chayna kaptinpas manam allinchu kanqa.
And one, bigger than that.	Hinaspa huk, chaymanta aswan hatun.
You never knew what was going to happen.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu ima pasananta.
I want to get it right.	Allinta hap’iyta munani.
About ten years ago.	Yaqa chunka wata ñawpaqta.
It would be a very foolish thing to do.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi kanman.
That was a very bad thing to do.	Chayqa ancha mana allin ruwaymi karqa.
She knew more about him now.	Payqa kunanmi paymanta astawan yacharqa.
I heard someone say this.	Pitapas kayna nisqanta uyarirqanim.
Obviously, the best course of action would be to do just that.	Sut’inmi, aswan allin ruwayqa kanman chayta ruwaymi.
That is why they are hungry.	Chayraykum yarqaymanta kachkanku.
I’ve been curious about this for a long time.	Unayñan kaymanta yachayta munarqani.
There was nothing at all.	Manam imapas karqachu ni imapipas.
He couldn't remember what it was.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
I've just been tired.	Chayraqmi sayk'usqa kani.
I thought this was the best.	Kaymi aswan allin kananpaq yuyaykurqani.
Which is fine, but that’s it.	Imataq allinmi, ichaqa chaymi.
That's just so ridiculous, unfortunately.	Chayqa ancha asikunapaq hinallam, llakikuypaqmi.
No one could figure out what was wrong.	Manam pipas ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
Please do that again.	Ama hina kaspa, chayta hukmanta ruway.
I want to do the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam ruwayta munani.
Soon it was like nothing else.	Pisi tiempollamantan mana imapas hinachu karqan.
But it would be better.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
That means they don’t have the right attitude.	Chayqa niyta munan mana allintachu yuyayniyuq kasqankuta.
He thinks he is safe.	Payqa seguro kashasqanmantan yuyaykun.
It is the only thing that is sure.	Chaylla kasqanmanta seguro kaqmi.
I would love to see if anyone has.	Munaymanmi qawayta sichus pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Unfortunately, this is important.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa ancha allin.
It was already black.	Ñam yana kasqa.
It’s easier and nicer that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan facilmi, aswan sumaqmi.
Two, you’re stupid.	Iskay, sonso kanki.
Maybe that’s the time.	Ichapas chay pacha.
And he’s very good.	Hinaspa payqa ancha allinmi.
But in the past, it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa ñawpaq tiempopiqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
No one could help him.	Manam pipas yanapayta atirqachu.
The process went quickly.	Chay ruwayqa utqayllam rirqa.
He was hurt, angry and scared.	Payqa k’irisqa, phiñasqa, mancharisqa ima kasqa.
It was a very serious injury.	Ancha sinchi k’irisqa karqan.
You can’t do it here.	Kaypiqa manan atiwaqchu.
That’s a big if.	Chayqa hatun sichus.
I hope to hear from you soon .	Suyachkani chaylla uyariyta .
That’s all, if you want.	Chaylla, munaspaqa.
Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t.	Ichapas payqa karqa, ichapas mana.
It just looked ugly.	Chayllam millay rikchakurqa.
He was very, very angry.	Payqa ancha ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
That was funny though.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa ichaqa.
All great.	Tukuy hatun.
But it wasn’t an easy task.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa facilchu karqan.
That sounds good to me.	Chayqa allinmi ñuqapaq uyarikun.
He’s been talking for a long time.	Unayñam riman.
You have to do that.	Chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
In this city that was new to him.	Kay llaqtapi chaymi musuq karqa paypaq.
He certainly didn’t mean the truth.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana cheqaqtachu niyta munarqan.
But eventually we did.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqayku.
He speaks really well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta riman.
We are bigger than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan hatunmi kanchik.
Great stuff! 	Hatun imakuna!
But they really are a big deal.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin hatun ruway kanku.
Here’s what happened though.	Kaypi ichaqa imachus pasasqanmanta.
I didn't expect it to come so soon.	Manam suyarqanichu chayna utqaylla hamunanta.
That sounds pretty sad.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi uyarikun.
We need to do this regularly.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwananchik.
It’s amazing he can even do it.	Admirakuypaqmi payqa ruwaytapas atinman.
But he didn’t say that.	Ichaqa manan chayta nirqanchu.
So how can I do it.	Chaymi imaynatataq ruwayman.
The first in the world!.	¡Ñawpaq kaq kay pachapi!.
I want to see greatness.	Hatun kayta rikuyta munani.
So we can’t remember.	Chaymi mana yuyariyta atichwanchu.
This may not be the only option.	Kayqa manapaschá chayllachu kanqa.
But recently, there it is.	Ichaqa chayllaraqmi, chaypim kachkan.
This process, however, is not the only one.	Kay ruwayqa ichaqa manan chayllachu.
Anyway, go with us.	Imayna kaptinpas, ñuqaykuwan kuska riy.
The first all day.	Ñawpaq kaq tukuy punchaw.
Hurt with you.	Qanwan k’irisqa.
There was no one.	Manam pipas karqanchu.
He wasn't there at all.	Payqa manam chaypichu karqa ni imapipas.
I am really colder.	Chiqaptam aswan chiri kani.
But it’s been a long time.	Ichaqa unayñan.
I'm not sure it's human.	Manam segurochu kani runa kasqanmanta.
In fact, it is perhaps the greatest achievement.	Chiqaptaqa ichapas aswan hatun ruwaymi.
From being discouraged.	Hukmanyasqa kaymanta.
They are all important.	Llapallankum importante kanku.
I’m thinking about the house.	Wasipi yuyaykushani.
And good for him.	Hinaspa allin paypaq.
So this is dismissed.	Chaymi kayqa qarqusqa kachkan.
This is crazy!!! 	Kayqa loco!!!
He wanted to hear what she said.	Chayna nisqanta uyariyta munarqa.
I didn’t want to go either.	Ñuqapas manam riyta munarqanichu.
But it doesn’t, not yet.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwanchu, manaraqmi.
There are two ways to do this.	Chaytaqa iskay ruwaymi kan.
Therefore, it is not.	Chayraykum mana.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But it's all too good to be true, anyway.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq, imayna kaptinpas.
You really never knew.	Qamqa chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas yacharqankichu.
I will not do that here.	Kaypiqa manam chaynataqa ruwasaqchu.
He was put there.	Payqa chaypi churasqa kachkarqa.
But now he wanted to know.	Ichaqa kunanmi yachayta munarqan.
But they may not always be.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapa kutichu chayna kanku.
You know this stuff better than I do.	Qamqa ñuqamanta aswan allintam kay imatapas yachanki.
If so, do everything you can to make it happen.	Chayna kaptinqa tukuy imata ruway chayna kananpaq.
Maybe he was, or maybe she .	Ichapas pay karqa, utaq ichapas pay .
He knew how bad it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna millay kasqanmanta.
I did it recently too.	Ñuqapas chayllaraqmi ruwarqani.
However, this	Ichaqa, kay .
Everything was sad, lonely and sad.	Tukuy imapas llakisqa, sapallan hinaspa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I never heard from him again.	Manaña hayk’aqpas paymanta uyarirqanichu.
And he wanted to leave.	Hinaspa ripuyta munarqa.
Sick in the morning.	Tutamanta unqusqa.
Don’t do it anymore.	Amaña ruwaychu.
You still have to make a play.	Hinallam huk pukllayta ruwanayki.
Again, it’s a process.	Yapamanta huk ruwaymi.
It was a good day, that day.	Allin punchawmi karqa, chay punchaw.
We’re wrong.	Pantasqa kanchik.
Everyone's younger than me.	Lliwmi ñuqamanta sullk'a kanku.
But it may not be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman chayta ruwayqa.
Those people are obviously not.	Chay runakunaqa sut’inmi mana kasqankuta.
We did things together, for sure.	Kuska imatapas ruwarqayku, seguro.
He’s not always right, you know.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu allinta riman, yachanki.
Do whatever you want.	Ima munasqaykita ruway.
Isn't it?.	¿Manachu?.
It’s that difficult.	Chayna sasam.
These people are serious.	Kay runakunaqa serio kanku.
Maybe that’s the case for me.	Ichapas chayna kanman ñuqapaq.
There is nothing like you.	Manan imapas qan hinaqa kanchu.
Everything went very fast.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam rirqa.
In fact, it has been around for a long time.	Aswanpas unayñan kashan.
He looked very ill.	Payqa ancha unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He has been absent for a long time.	Payqa unayñan mana chaypichu kashan.
I’ve never seen one.	Mana hayk’aqpas hukta rikurqanichu.
Very sad for me.	Ancha llakisqa ñuqapaq.
More from hunger.	Astawan yarqaymanta.
This seems to be one of them.	Kayqa hukninmi rikchakun.
I was a week ago.	Huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqani.
But I don’t understand why.	Ichaqa manan entiendenichu imarayku chayta.
I think you’re all over it.	Yuyaykuni tukuy chaypi kasqaykita.
It just kept happening.	Chayqa hinallam pasarqa.
But they always were.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi karqanku.
That was the other person.	Chayqa huknin runam karqa.
I’ve always been a fool.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi mana yuyayniyuq karqani.
The man said so.	Runaqa chaynatam nirqa.
Be more realistic.	Aswan chiqap kay.
Good for you, seriously.	Allinmi qampaq, serio.
He is a human being like everyone else.	Payqa llapa runa hinam runa.
I’m not a big baby talker.	Manam hatun wawa rimaq runachu kani.
There is a big, big difference.	Hatun, hatun chikan kaymi kan.
He does everything on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi tukuy imatapas ruwan.
So it didn’t work out.	Chayraykum mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He doesn’t care what happened.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imachus pasasqanmantaqa.
He knew he wanted to be rich.	Payqa yacharqanmi qhapaq kayta munasqanmanta.
They are neither here nor there.	Paykunaqa manan kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kanku.
I think he would have been good for you.	Yuyaykuni, payqa allin kanman karqan qanpaq.
And he’s a smoker.	Hinaspa payqa cigarrota pitaq.
They are	Paykunaqa .
However, you may disagree.	Ichaqa, manapaschá acuerdopichu kanki.
Goodness everyone.	Allin kay llapa runa.
That’s a pretty good thing to do.	Chayqa allin allin ruwaymi.
I can do a lot better.	Achka aswan allintam ruwayta atiyman.
But that didn’t work.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa allinchu karqan.
Things were better now.	Kunanqa imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
He was so great to me.	Payqa ancha hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
She said it was wonderful.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi kasqanmanta nirqa.
Fortunately, it was easy.	Ancha kusisqa, mana sasachu karqa.
Means he could be there again today.	Niyta munan kunan punchaw yapamanta chaypi kanman.
Both were intelligent.	Iskayninkum yachaysapa karqaku.
No, it didn’t go well.	Manan, manan allintachu rirqan.
It was a really bad time for me.	Chiqamanta mana allin tiempo karqa ñuqapaq.
He said they were not here.	Paymi nirqa mana kaypichu kasqankuta.
He knew the way.	Payqa ñanta yacharqa.
So far, there is something I know.	Kunankamaqa, kanmi imapas riqsisqay.
He knows how to look good.	Payqa yachanmi imayna sumaq rikchayniyuq kananta.
He wanted to answer.	Payqa kutichiyta munarqa.
He was finally there.	Payqa tukukuypi chaypi kachkarqa.
Here and there.	Kayman chayman.
Something that wasn’t there before.	Imapas mana ñawpaqta chaypi kaq.
It just didn't seem right.	Chaylla mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
Not, at least, for him.	Mana, aswanpas, paypaq.
Not to be rushed.	Mana utqaylla ruwana.
Do some of the things you do.	Wakin ruwaykunata ruway.
For the child to go to a safe home.	Wawa allin wasiman rinanpaq.
I’m not sure what that might be.	Manam segurochu kani imataq chay kanman.
You never knew what was out there.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu imakuna hawapi kasqanmantaqa.
Obviously, if you think about it.	Sut'inmi, sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
I still can't tell you much about it.	Kunankamapas manam anchatachu chaymantaqa willayta atiyman.
Now you know everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachanki.
One fool does a lot.	Huk mana yuyayniyuqmi achkata ruwan.
He can’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
But every morning.	Ichaqa sapa paqarinmi.
I didn’t want to go with him.	Manam paywan riyta munarqanichu.
Still, it was a wonderful experience.	Chayna kaptinpas, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It shouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanan.
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
You'll be better off with it.	Aswan allintam chaywanqa kanki.
You can be sure it’s beautiful.	Seguro kanki sumaq kasqanmanta.
Then, what	Chaymanta, ima .
You never know where it is.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I wasn’t like this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan kay hinachu karqani.
I want to be this.	Ñuqaqa kaytam munani.
This process is not unique.	Kay ruwayqa manan sapallanchu.
This certainly didn’t.	Kayqa chiqamanta mana ruwarqanchu.
He did some interesting things.	Wakin sumaq ruwaykunata ruwarqan.
That he couldn’t think of a better answer.	Aswan allin kutichiyta mana yuyaykusqanmanta.
Further comment would not be appropriate at this time.	Astawan rimayqa manan kay tiempopiqa allinchu kanman.
It's all out there now anyway.	Tukuy chay hawapi kunan kachkan imayna kaptinpas.
A week or two, maybe.	Huk iskay semana, ichapas.
He would party with her.	Payqa paywan kuskan fiestata ruwaq.
He tried, but he couldn’t do it.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi, ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
So you agree with me.	Chaymi ñoqawan acuerdopi kashanki.
That means so much.	Chayqa ancha achkatam niyta munan.
So this stuff is bad, really bad.	Chaymi kay imapas mana allin, chiqap mana allin.
I can’t make money.	Manam qullqita tariyta atinichu.
Soon it’s the only thing people know about you.	Pisi tiempollamantan chaylla runakuna qanmanta yachanku.
Perhaps that will be the case here.	Ichapas chayna kaypi kanqa.
I haven’t seen that before.	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
We were playing games.	Pukllaq kayku.
This is not so easy.	Kayqa manam chayna facilchu.
There is no one else who does it.	Manam pipas huk ruwaq kanchu.
You are like the other person.	Qamqa huknin runa hinam kanki.
As an adult, maybe more.	Kuraq hina, yaqapaschá aswan.
That is not a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
You still want him to fail.	Hinallam munanki mana allinta ruwananta.
Tired, tired, tired.	Sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa.
Such a practice was to be avoided.	Chayna ruwayqa manañam kanan karqachu.
It is as it should be.	Imayna kanan hinam kachkan.
So do this thing.	Chaymi kayta ruway.
So that was pretty bad.	Chaymi chayqa ancha millay karqan.
He, of course, happily opened it.	Payqa, chiqamanta, kusisqa kicharirqa.
I certainly don’t want to be like that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chay hina kayta munanichu.
This is the best you.	Kaymi aswan allin qamqa.
And this is a big deal.	Hinaspa kayqa hatun ruwaymi.
If you’re right.	Sichus allin kanki.
Not a one.	Manam huk.
There’s nothing wrong with that at all.	Chaypiqa manan imapas mana allinchu ni imapipas.
He couldn’t bear to hear it.	Payqa manan aguantayta atirqanchu uyariyta.
There was baseball.	Chaypin béisbol nisqa karqan.
He’d be really scared.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa kanman.
He says so, anyway.	Chaynatam nin, imayna kaptinpas.
He doesn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yachanchu ima ruwananta.
She was worried and scared.	Payqa llakisqa, mancharisqa ima kasqa.
He was the best man.	Paymi aswan allin runa karqan.
It means greater.	Aswan hatun niyta munan.
And, you know, that was it.	Hinaspa, yachanki, chaymi karqan.
But what happened to him he never knew.	Ichaqa imachus paymanta pasasqanmantaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu.
That may not have been a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu karqa.
I want a lot of it.	Ancha achkatam munani.
Never rush anyone.	Mana hayk’aqpas pitapas usqhayllachu.
I strongly disagree.	Sinchita mana acuerdopichu kani.
After all, he wasn't alone in this.	Tukuy imamanta, mana sapallanchu kaypi karqa.
This would be the third.	Kayqa kimsa kaqmi kanman.
So he thinks about it.	Chaymi payqa yuyaykun.
Go and do nice things.	Riy hinaspa sumaq ruwaykunata ruway.
Now I know that this is not the case.	Kunanmi yachani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
It would have been nice and simple.	Sumaq hinaspa mana sasachu kanman karqa.
I don’t like doing that.	Chay ruwayqa manan gustawanchu.
It was very clear that there was something else going on.	Ancha sut’inmi karqan huk ruway kasqanmanta.
Tell me what you know about him.	Paymanta ima yachasqaykita willaway.
Fast, strong, good.	Utqaylla, sinchi, allin.
He wasn't quite sure how he did it.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imaynatachus chay ruwasqanmanta.
I do do that, though.	Chaytaqa ichaqa ruwani.
It was like him.	Pay hinam karqa.
He wanted to work.	Payqa llamkayta munarqa.
Too much for me.	Ancha achka ñuqapaq.
You're not really there.	Manam chiqaptachu chaypi kachkanki.
As big as possible.	Atisqanman hina hatun.
There was something funny about it.	Chaypiqa imapas asikunapaq hinam karqa.
No one could understand them.	Chaykunataqa manam pipas entiendeyta atirqachu.
That’s how it should be done.	Chaynatam ruwanan.
But otherwise he seemed unscathed.	Ichaqa mana chayqa mana ima k’irisqa hinan karqan.
I do it again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta ruwani.
He knew he would do it again and again.	Payqa yacharqanmi sapa kutilla chayta ruwananta.
It’s not really like you.	Manam chiqaptaqa qam hinachu.
He couldn’t think of anything else.	Payqa manañan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
If he is married.	Casarasqa kaptinqa.
This was good, he thought.	Kayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykurqan.
It’s not very good at all.	Manan imapipas ancha allinchu.
I was just like you.	Ñuqapas qam hinam karqani.
But it won’t be any faster.	Ichaqa manan aswan usqhayllachu kanqa.
He is quick.	Payqa utqayllam.
He obviously didn’t.	Sut’inmi mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
This was an annual event.	Kayqa sapa wata ruwaymi karqa.
That was really, really hard for me.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap sasa ñuqapaq karqa.
It’s almost amazing.	Yaqa admirakuypaqmi.
There’s a scientist.	Chaypin huk yachaysapa.
Otherwise, proceed to the next step.	Mana chayqa, qatiqnin ruwayman riy.
Ready, set .	Listo, churasqa .
There is a negative attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuq kaymi kan.
Everyone wants to have sex with her.	Lliwmi paywan puñuyta munanku.
If anyone knows about it.	Sichus pipas chaymanta yachan chayqa.
Now there is no reason.	Kunanqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
Otherwise, it fails.	Mana chayqa, mana allintachu ruwan.
He was nobody, nobody.	Payqa manam pipas karqachu, manam pipas karqachu.
This was not unique.	Kayqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
Now it's like one of mine.	Kunanqa huknin ñuqapa hinam.
But there is nothing like it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinaqa kanchu.
It was such a beautiful place.	Chayna sumaqmi karqa.
there is something good for you.	kanmi allin qampaq.
It was beautifully set up.	Sumaq churasqa karqa.
He was very ambiguous.	Payqa ancha iskay yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Many people are like that.	Achka runakunam chayna.
To do wrong is to do wrong.	Mana allin ruwayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
That lasted a couple of days.	Chayqa iskay kimsa punchawmi karqa.
He didn't want to know, really.	Mana yachayta munarqanchu, chiqaptapuni.
More more happier!.	Aswan aswan kusisqa!.
Maybe it’s not.	Ichapas manapaschá.
I don’t really know what it is.	Manam allintachu yachani ima kasqanmanta.
A little bit of it.	Huk chikan.
So the day passed.	Chaymi chay punchaw pasarqa.
Very sad about this.	Ancha llakisqa kaymanta.
This is obviously excluded.	Kayqa sut’inmi qarqosqa kashan.
He seemed too good to be true.	Payqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa mana munasqanman hina.
I’d be more annoyed without it.	Mana chaywanqa aswan phiñasqa kayman.
Tell me	Willaway .
There is never anyone there.	Chaypiqa manam haykapipas pipas kanchu.
I wasn’t too surprised.	Manam anchatachu admirakurqani.
Some very, very good ones.	Wakin ancha, ancha allin.
I wonder what happened.	Tapukuni imataq pasarqa.
You lived there.	Chaypim yacharqanki.
I’m sure he’s very serious now.	Seguro kani kunanqa ancha serio kasqanmanta.
I was I just was.	Ñuqaqa karqani chayllaraqmi karqani.
He doesn’t, not really.	Payqa manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
I want to get out of there.	Chaymanta lluqsiyta munani.
It didn’t seem to be very good.	Manas ancha allinchu kanman hina karqan.
I don't have time to say more.	Manam tiempoy kanchu astawan rimanaypaq.
Probably next year.	Yaqapaschá hamuq wata.
I’m here to stay, too.	Ñuqapas kaypi kachkani.
But there is no point in repeating it now.	Ichaqa manan valenchu ​​kunan yapamanta rimayqa.
One was a big, ugly one.	Hukninmi karqa hatun, millay kaq.
He would like to talk to her about it.	Payqa chaymantam paywan rimayta munanman.
I will always be there.	Ñoqaqa sapa kutim kasaq.
Then he went with me.	Chaymantam ñuqawan rirqa.
You’re hungry, baby.	Yarqaymanta kanki, wawa.
Three days is better.	Kimsa punchawmi aswan allin.
Then the next, then the last.	Chaymanta qatiqnin, chaymanta qhipa kaq.
There are a lot of great people there.	Chaypiqa achka hatun runakunam kachkan.
But he was never really crazy.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu loco karqan.
He is the man you want.	Paymi munasqayki runa.
It was really true.	Chiqaptam chiqap karqa.
He is still the greatest.	Payqa kunankamapas aswan hatunmi kachkan.
After that he does nothing.	Chay qhepamanmi mana imatapas ruwanchu.
One, and then another.	Huknin, chaymanta huk.
But for now it’s hard.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa sasam.
But that one will do.	Ichaqa chay hukninmi ruwanqa.
He opened the door for her.	Payqa punkuta kicharirqa paypaq.
Often the man was a teacher.	Sapa kutim chay runaqa yachachiq karqa.
Here at least.	Kaypiqa aswanpas.
Here’s an easy way to do just that.	Kaypi huk facil ruway chayta ruwanapaq.
Does anyone have any thoughts on this.	¿Pipas kaymanta ima yuyayniyuqchu.
No one could outwork him.	Manan pipas paymanta aswan llank’ayta atirqanchu.
Nothing for us to do here.	Mana imatapas kaypi ruwanaykupaq.
But again, you want to play.	Ichaqa yapamanta, pukllayta munanki.
He can’t hear anything.	Manam imatapas uyariyta atinchu.
So I can't see anything.	Chaymi mana imatapas qawayta atinichu.
I couldn’t let that moment just happen.	Manam chay rato chaylla pasananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatunmi kasqa.
I knew it ahead of time.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani.
But here, there was nothing.	Ichaqa kaypiqa, manam imapas karqachu.
That has always been the case.	Chay hinaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
But I can’t find a job.	Ichaqa manan llank’ayta tarinichu.
He was very upset and angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
Things were not as they should be here.	Imapas manam kaypiqa kanan hinachu karqa.
But again, what a precedent.	Ichaqa yapamanta, ima ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
But the next step was not so easy.	Ichaqa qatiqnin ruwayqa manan chhayna facilchu karqan.
You were so amazing.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi karqanki.
Good for you, we’re proud.	Allinmi qanpaq, orgulloso kayku.
He’s very intelligent like that.	Payqa ancha yuyayniyuqmi chayna.
She looks beautiful tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam sumaq rikchayniyuq.
This is what it means to be all new.	Kaymi tukuy musuq kay niyta munan.
But he knew he didn't.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
There are some people who don’t.	Kanmi wakin runakuna mana chayta.
You don’t know what this is.	Manan yachankichu imachus kay kasqanmanta.
He was, after all, a reasonable man.	Payqa, tukuy imamanta, allin yuyayniyuq runa karqa.
Maybe once a month.	Ichapas killapi huk kutita.
Perhaps there was nothing he could do.	Ichapas mana ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
You are the best thing ever.	Aswan allin kaqmi kanki.
The less known the better.	Aswan pisi riqsisqa kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
You are like everyone else.	Qamqa llapa runakuna hinam kanki.
I wasn't sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam segurochu tarikurqani.
I really want to know!.	¡Anchatan munani yachayta!.
That lasted most of the day.	Chayqa yaqa llapan punchawmi karqa.
I know it takes time.	Yachanim tiempota necesitasqanmanta.
Like me now.	Kunan ñuqa hina.
Therefore, there could have been something wrong.	Chayraykum imapas mana allin ruwayqa kanman karqa.
It was me all along.	Tukuy tiempon ñoqa karqani.
This is almost certain.	Kayqa yaqa segurom kachkan.
Now, say the talk.	Kunanqa, rimayta niy.
I didn’t think much of it before.	Chaypiqa manan anchatachu yuyaykurqani ñawpaqtaqa.
There’s something there.	Chaypiqa kanmi imapas.

He is a human being, just like you.	Payqa runam, qam hina.
The whole thing was amazing.	Chay tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I’m going to need time.	Tiempota necesitasaq.
But he cannot be guilty.	Ichaqa manan huchayoq kayta atinmanchu.
I want to see what comes back.	Imakuna kutimunanta rikuyta munani.
It was beautiful again.	Yapamanta sumaqmi karqa.
That was a very good crowd.	Chayqa ancha allin runakunam karqa.
Here’s how.	Kaypi imayna.
This is what happened for me.	Kaymi ñuqapaq pasarqa.
Since I was a child.	Wawa kasqaymanta pacha.
Nothing he did was wrong.	Mana imapas ruwasqanqa mana allinchu karqa.
He still couldn't speak.	Kunankamapas manañam rimayta atirqachu.
At least like you.	Aswanpas qan hina.
It's a school day.	Yachay wasi p'unchawmi.
Who knows what the future holds.	¿Pitaq yachan hamuq tiempopi imakuna pasananta.
It didn’t go so well.	Manam chayna allintachu rirqa.
But it’s not there anymore.	Ichaqa manañan kanchu.
He was no better.	Payqa manañan aswan allinchu karqan.
I still love those things.	Chaykunataqa kunankamapas anchatam munani.
He was very proud of his success.	Payqa ancha hatunmi karqa allin ruwasqanmanta.
You either have it for you or you don’t.	Ichapas qampaq kanki utaq mana kanchu.
His youth in that city.	Chay llaqtapi wayna kasqanmanta.
Maybe you were drunk at the time.	Ichapas chay tiempopiqa machasqa karqanki.
It was a big deal there.	Chaypiqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
He was wrong.	Payqa pantasqa kasqa.
Which is, well, not good.	Imataq, allin, mana allinchu.
I still can't believe it.	Kunankamapas manam chaytaqa creeyta atinichu.
Anyway, one day he just got tired.	Imayna kaptinpas, huk punchawmi chaylla sayk’usqa.
This is all about speed.	Kayqa tukuy imapas utqaylla kasqanmantam.
I know it exists.	Yachanim kasqanmanta.
What do you know about it.	Imamantataq yachanki.
I seriously can’t stand it.	Serio mana aguantayta atinichu.
He knows how to win.	Payqa yachan atipayta.
I am here to tell you something else.	Kaypi kachkani hukta willanaypaq.
He always wanted to help.	Payqa sapa kutim yanapayta munarqa.
But the process was not easy.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.
That’s two main things.	Chayqa iskay hatun kaqmi.
He is the best man.	Payqa aswan allin runam.
I didn’t see what was going to happen.	Manam rikurqanichu ima kananta.
It was the black one.	Chayqa yana kaqmi karqa.
But it wasn’t bad at all.	Ichaqa manan imapipas mana allinchu karqan.
He couldn't hold it.	Mana hap'iyta atirqanchu.
He died a violent death.	Payqa sinchitan wañupurqan.
Don't ever do this.	Ama hayk'aqpas kayta ruwaychu.
That was a problem hidden all of last year.	Chayqa karqan huk sasachakuy pakasqa llapan qayna wata.
I actually thought he did better last night.	Chiqaptaqa qayna tutam aswan allinta ruwasqanmanta piensarqani.
Then you have a good sense of humor.	Chaymantaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
He wanted her now.	Payqa kunanmi payta munarqan.
Go home, baby.	Wasiman riy, wawa.
I feel strongly about this.	Kaymantaqa sinchitan sientekuni.
There's no problem'.	Manam kanchu sasachakuy'.
Injury or no injury.	K’irisqa utaq mana k’irisqa.
These seem to do the job just fine.	Kaykunaqa allintam llamk’ayta ruwanman hina.
But he is afraid to tell.	Ichaqa manchakunmi willayta.
It’s really there.	Chiqaptam chaypi kachkan.
I won't have time to celebrate with him.	Manam tiempoy kanqachu paywan fiestata ruwanaypaq.
Of course, it’s not pointless.	Arí, manan mana imapaqpas valenchu.
You know very well it wasn't me.	Allintam yachanki mana ñuqachu kasqanmanta.
He looked at the door.	Punkuta qhawarisqa.
I always like it here.	Kaypiqa sapa kutim gustan.
I mean really crazy.	Chiqamanta loco niyta munani.
The second moment happened.	Iskay kaq rato pasarqa.
It was a sense of guilt.	Huchayoq kaymi karqan.
You're pretty good, actually.	Allin allinmi kanki, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe you want to be with me.	Ichapas ñuqawan kayta munanki.
Perhaps he wanted her to.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta munarqan.
He does everything right.	Payqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwan.
I mean really hard.	Chiqamanta sinchita niyta munani.
So, okay, maybe he's not ready.	Chaymi, allinmi, ichapas mana listochu kachkan.
Obviously, he is.	Sut’inmi, payqa.
This obviously makes no sense.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana imapaqpas valenchu.
These people don’t exist.	Kay runakunaqa manam kanchu.
Then this is it.	Chaymantaqa kaymi.
So maybe yeah.	Chaymi ichapas arí.
Everything will be as it was before.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaq hinam kanqa.
Everyone is really excited.	Lliwmi chiqaptapuni kusisqa kachkanku.
I don't believe in that.	Chaypiqa manam creenichu.
This was a good thing, to be honest.	Kayqa allinmi karqa, chiqap kaptinqa.
That seems amazing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi rikchakun.
I actually hope so.	Chiqaptaqa chaytam suyachkani.
I’ve always wanted to say that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayta niyta munarqani.
Performance was excellent.	Ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
This will be easier.	Kayqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
It’s a very serious thing.	Ancha serio kaqmi.
Unfortunately, that remains a problem.	Llakikuypaqmi, chayqa sasachakuy hinallam kachkan.
Maybe the third one.	Ichapas kimsa kaq kaq.
I’m not sure what the best course of action would be.	Manam segurochu kani ima aswan allin ruway kanman chayta.
I can’t get out now.	Manam kunanqa lluqsiyta atinichu.
This is a tough crowd.	Kayqa sinchi achka runakunam.
He was like a big happy kid.	Payqa hatun kusisqa wawa hinam karqa.
And I’ll be the one.	Hinaspa ñuqa kasaq.
I want to, too!.	¡Ñuqapas munani!.
It’s really important.	Chiqaptam ancha importante.
But that sounds ridiculous.	Ichaqa chayqa asikunapaq hinan uyarikun.
Where is it located? 	¿Maypitaq kachkan?
He knew he had done his best.	Payqa yacharqanmi tukuy atisqanman hina ruwasqanmanta.
I feel so much better.	Ancha allintam tarikuni.
I just didn’t realize it would take this long.	Chaylla mana repararqanichu kay unayta pasananta.
It’s in big trouble again.	Yapamanta hatun sasachakuypi kachkan.
I never wanted to be any different.	Manam haykapipas huk hina kaytaqa munarqanichu.
What an absurdity it was.	Ima mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Tell me what the problem is.	Willaway ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
A lot of people were very unhappy.	Achka runakunam ancha mana kusisqa karqaku.
He couldn’t have known.	Payqa manan yachayta atinmanchu karqan.
He was happy to do so.	Payqa kusisqam chayta ruwarqa.
I feel like that's a lot.	Chayqa achka hinam tarikuni.
He wants her to do it.	Payqa munanmi chayta ruwananta.
She was too exhausted to resist.	Payqa sinchi sayk’usqañan kasharqan, manan hark’ayta atirqanchu.
These are more obvious.	Kaykunaqa aswan sut’inmi.
Nothing can go wrong in the future.	Manan imapas qhepaman mana allinchu kanman.
Yes, he was the best player of his time.	Arí, payqa chay tiempopi aswan allin pukllaqmi karqan.
There is a great man.	Chaypin kashan hatun runa.
That was all good.	Chayqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
Have a nice day!!!.	Qampaq allin punchaw!!!.
He refused to give his name.	Payqa manan munarqanchu mana sutinta willayta.
But he’s afraid, man.	Ichaqa manchakunmi, runa.
But after that, nothing.	Ichaqa chay qhepamanmi mana imapas.
I couldn’t believe how easy it was to do.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna facil ruway kasqanmanta.
Tell me about yourself first.	Ñawpaqtaqa qanmanta willaway.
Maybe this is it.	Ichapas kay.
It will probably be here.	Kaypiqa yaqapaschá kanqa.
This way it would be better.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I don’t remember one.	Manam hukta yuyarinichu.
I wasn’t sure about that though.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu karqani ichaqa.
If you don’t, you really want one.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, cheqaqtapunin hukta munanki.
I had to be there to do it.	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa chaypim kanay karqa.
It shouldn’t be the only thing.	Manan chayllachu kanan.
It was very sad, it was sad.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa, llakikuypaqmi karqa.
Yeah, that seems better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi rikchakun.
They probably still exist.	Yaqapaschá kunankamapas kachkanku.
Other people, an hour a week.	Huk runakuna, semanapi huk hora.
There is something very good there.	Chaypiqa imapas ancha allinmi kachkan.
This should be pretty easy.	Kayqa ancha facilmi kanan.
She is a smart girl.	Payqa yachaysapa sipasmi.
Almost no one noticed.	Yaqa mana pipas repararqanchu.
He can't come.	Payqa manam hamuyta atinmanchu.
And you’re alone.	Hinaspa sapallayki kanki.
The man didn’t want anything.	Chay runaqa manan imatapas munarqanchu.
He never knew how to do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta ruwaytaqa yacharqanchu.
He is doing it all on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi tukuy chayta ruwachkan.
Such a great guy.	Chayna hatun runa.
He didn’t want to be left alone.	Payqa manan sapallan qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
I’d be happy too.	Ñuqapas kusisqa kayman.
And he went out.	Hinaspa lluqsirqa.
They are all intelligent, he said.	Llapallankum allin yuyayniyuq kanku, nispa.
John lived there busy.	Juanqa chaypi tiyaq ocupasqa.
Be mindful, be very mindful.	Yuyayniyuq kay, ancha yuyayniyuq kay.
I know they are smart.	Yachanim yachaysapa kasqankuta.
I really, really want to do that again.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta chayta ruwayta munani yapamanta.
Almost too big.	Yaqa ancha hatun.
So keep busy.	Chaymi ocupasqa kay.
That’s what you said.	Chaynatam qamqa nirqa.
John wasn’t like that.	Juanqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Yes, it is	Arí, chayqa .
I think this is a good thing.	Kayqa allin kananpaqmi piensani.
He was never able to work again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas llank’ayta atirqanchu.
Yes, for me.	Arí ñuqapaq.
If that’s all.	Sichus chaylla.
Which is very stupid.	Imataq ancha sonso.
What does it say? 	¿Ima nin?
Maybe he’ll have some ideas.	Ichapas payqa wakin yuyayniyuq kanqa.
It’s like very, very cold.	Ancha ancha chiri hinam.
He didn’t speak well.	Payqa manan allintachu rimaq.
I really like him.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa gustan.
It’s amazing that it’s about nothing.	Admirakuypaqmi mana imamantapas kasqanmanta.
I don’t know what to do.	Manam yachanichu ima ruwaytapas.
It was last year, at least.	Qayna wata karqan, aswanpas.
But they are not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu kanku.
I almost want him to.	Yaqapaschá munani chayta ruwananta.
It’s never that simple.	Manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
No, they were black.	Manan, paykunaqa yana karqanku.
The guy isn’t good enough.	Chay runaqa manam allinchu.
But I’m a little worried about something.	Ichaqa imamantapas huk chhikantan llakikuni.
And he was happy here.	Hinaspa kaypi kusisqa kasqa.
But everything seemed too much.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas llumpay hinam karqa.
He was always alone.	Sapa kutim sapallan karqa.
Maybe he’s mine.	Ichapas payqa ñuqapa kanman.
Actually, I learned about it.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantam yacharqani.
Nothing else important.	Mana imapas huk importante kaq.
But that will come.	Ichaqa chaymi hamunqa.
So glad he liked it.	Chaymi kusisqa payqa gustasqanmanta.
He loves to talk about me.	Payqa anchatam munan ñuqamanta rimayta.
In the morning, in the afternoon, at night.	Tutamanta, tarde, tuta.
You are bigger than me.	Qamqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi kanki.
Maybe it’s not worth it.	Ichapas mana valenchu.
They were great there.	Chaypiqa hatunmi karqaku.
He couldn't be sure it was him.	Payqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu pay kasqanmanta.
It would be more human.	Aswan runa hina kanman.
Now, though, it’s! 	¡Kunanmi ichaqa!
This was a good, sensible move.	Kayqa allin, allin yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqa.
You can’t sit or lie down.	Manam tiyayta nitaq puñuyta atiwaqchu.
I hope that is the case.	Chayna kananpaqmi suyachkani.
He does what he wants.	Payqa munasqanman hinam ruwan.
The first there, the last to go.	Ñawpaq kaq chaypi, qhipa kaq ripunanpaq.
But it’s not working so well.	Ichaqa manan chay hina allintachu llank’ashan.
But this is a big one.	Ichaqa kayqa hatunmi.
This, however, is not easy.	Kayqa ichaqa manan facilchu.
The oldest is a strong head.	Kuraq kaqmi sinchi uma.
This is the minimum.	Kayqa aswan pisi kaqmi.
What’s wrong with that.	Imataq mana allinchu.
He is the one, alone.	Paymi chay, sapallan.
A handsome man would be there.	Huk sumaq rikchayniyuq runa chaypi kanman.
You’re not quite there.	Manam allintachu chaypiqa kanki.
He is a childish people.	Payqa wawa runakunam.
You are very quick.	Ancha utqayllam kanki.
But that’s really crazy.	Ichaqa chayqa cheqaqtapunin loco.
Tomorrow is a big day.	Paqarin hatun punchawmi.
There were many mourners in the city.	Llaqtapiqa achka llakisqa runakunam karqaku.
This happened, and then that.	Kayqa pasarqa, chaymanta chay.
Is that a good practice?.	¿Chayqa allin ruwaychu?.
You said you wanted to go to school.	Yachay wasiman riyta munasqaykita nirqanki.
I don’t know how to talk.	Manam yachanichu imayna rimayta.
He looked bad, really bad.	Payqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa, chiqap mana allinchu.
Otherwise the process will fail.	Mana chayqa chay ruwayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
It can do the job.	Chay llamk’ayta ruwayta atin.
Yeah, it’s kind of.	Arí, huk laya.
I know it is the right thing to do.	Yachanim allin ruway kasqanmanta.
Okay, here goes.	Allinmi, kaypi rin.
I certainly did that.	Chiqamanta chayta ruwarqani.
This is a very important point.	Kayqa ancha importante kaqmi.
This is not good man.	Kayqa manam allinchu runa.
After that, things will get pretty grim.	Chay qhepamanmi imapas sinchi llakisqa kanqa.
I haven’t heard anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas uyarirqanichu.
It’s really uncertain.	Chiqamanta mana segurochu kachkan.
No, he didn’t do that.	Manan, manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
This makes him do greater things.	Chaywanmi aswan hatun ruwaykunata ruwan.
And they’re well together.	Hinaspa allinta kuska kashanku.
Everything about him.	Paymanta tukuy ima.
Perhaps he will do so.	Yaqapaschá chaynata ruwanman.
But unfortunately not.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi mana.
But it wasn’t like anything else.	Ichaqa manan huk hinachu karqan.
He said he was there.	Payqa chaypi kashasqanmantan nirqan.
There was no black man.	Manam yana runa karqachu.
He can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atinmanchu.
I think about it all the time and think about it.	Chaypiqa sapa kutim piensani hinaspa chaypi piensani.
I think this may be true.	Kayqa chiqap kanman nispam yuyani.
He can barely walk.	Payqa yaqapaschá puriyta atin.
But he probably knows that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachan.
No one knows what to do with him.	Manan pipas yachanchu paywan ima ruwananta.
As a result, most people are hungry all the time.	Chayraykum yaqa llapan runakunaqa tukuy tiempo yarqaymanta kanku.
And isn’t that enough.	Hinaspa manachu chaylla.
He wasn’t like me.	Manam ñuqa hinachu karqa.
The more famous or senior the teacher, the better.	Aswan riqsisqa utaq kuraq yachachiq kaptinqa, aswan allinmi.
I don't know what to do here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi imata ruwanaypaq.
We cannot take anything for granted.	Manam imatapas allinpaq hapiyta atichwanchu.
It’s not like it’s not human.	Manan mana runa hinachu.
You knew that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam yacharqanki.
You can’t talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiwaqchu.
It’s not the best.	Manam aswan allinchu.
No chance of that now though.	Mana chansa chaymanta kunan ichaqa.
He can do nothing here.	Payqa manan imatapas kaypiqa ruwanmanchu.
No one knew what to make of him.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu paymanta ima ruwananta.
We cannot allow that to happen.	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
This one, in fact.	Kayqa, chiqaptaqa.
You always know it's there.	Sapa kutim yachanki chaypi kasqanmanta.
I hope it was the right thing to do.	Suyachkani allin ruway kasqanmanta.
It’s like last time.	Qayna kuti hinam.
I need one too.	Ñuqapas hukta necesitasaq.
That is what he is doing now.	Chaytan kunan ruwashan.
Already, however, there is a problem.	Ñam ichaqa huk sasachakuy kachkan.
He wouldn’t be the only one.	Payqa manan chayllachu kanman.
Someone has to do something.	Pipas imatapas ruwanan.
He’s better than what happened to me!.	¡Payqa aswan allinmi ñuqawan pasasqanmanta!.
You cannot reverse this process.	Kay ruwaytaqa manam kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
You are why two one.	Qam kanki imarayku iskay huk.
So this approach would be inappropriate.	Chaymi kay ruwayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Who can be a bad guy.	Pitaq mana allin ruwaq kanman.
The phrase was easier.	Chay rimayqa aswan facilmi karqa.
This one came up the other day.	Kayqa huk punchawmi hamurqa.
Such a one.	Chayna huk.
Still, it wasn't quite saying things right.	Chayna kaptinpas, mana allintachu imatapas allinta rimayqa karqa.
But he was very happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan.
Clearly a man.	Sut’inmi huk runa.
He wasn't sure why he was there.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imarayku chaypi kasqanmanta.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa allintan chaymanta seguro kasharqan.
Now I feel good about being caught.	Kunanqa allintan sientekuni hap’isqa kasqaymanta.
I was a good teacher.	Ñoqaqa allin yachachiqmi karqani.
I didn’t really want anything.	Manam imamantapas anchatachu munarqani.
I just couldn’t hear it.	Chaylla mana uyariyta atirqanichu.
I thought there was no one.	Mana pipas kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Not sure how it is.	Mana segurochu kani imaynatachus chayta.
That’s a thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa imapas.
I’d love to work with you!.	¡Anchatan munani qanwan llank’ayta!.
I am sad and unhappy.	Llakisqa hinaspa mana kusisqam kachkani.
That was something, anyway.	Chayqa imapas karqa, imayna kaptinpas.
He did these things in a wonderful way.	Chaykunataqa admirakuypaqmi ruwarqa.
You really do it.	Chiqaptam ruwanki.
And here it is.	Hinaspa kaypi chayna.
The youngest one.	Aswan sullk’a kaq.
All along he knew the truth.	Tukuy tiempon payqa cheqaq kaqta yacharqan.
He is truly happy.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kashan.
Both young, both smart.	Iskayninku wayna, iskayninku yachaysapa.
It’s hard to say if it’s a good thing.	Sasa niyta sichus allin kanman chayta.
I want everything.	Tukuy imatam munani.
It’s not bad or good.	Manam mana allinchu nitaq allinchu.
Modern people want everything right now.	Kunan pacha runakunaqa kunanpacha tukuy imata munanku.
Something was wrong, or very, very good.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa, utaq ancha, ancha allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t like in the city.	Manam llaqtapi hinachu karqa.
But that would be too much.	Ichaqa chayqa nishuta allinmi kanman.
I was just walking around.	Chaylla puriq kani.
He couldn’t find another story.	Manas huk willakuyta tariyta atirqachu.
Anyone and .	Pipas hinaspa .
Cold though.	Chiri ichaqa.
This could be a mistake.	Kayqa pantasqa kanman.
Which is the least.	Imataq aswan pisi kaq.
It wasn’t a double day.	Manam iskay kuti punchawchu karqa.
We can never understand it.	Manam haykapipas entiendeyta atichwanchu.
Something about this didn't seem right, at all.	Kaymanta imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa, ni imapipas.
He didn’t know how to catch it here.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kaypi hap’iyta.
The most popular one, that is.	Aswan riqsisqa kaq, chaymi.
The wicked man is worthless.	Mana allin ruwaq runaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
It was the last of him.	Chayqa karqan paymanta qhepa kaq.
There is no wrongdoing.	Manam mana allin ruwayqa kanchu.
They want to get rid of me.	Paykunaqa ñuqamanta lluqsiyta munanku.
We are irrational.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
He wasn’t like the rest of the people.	Payqa manam wakin runakuna hinachu karqa.
Please say it again.	Ama hina kaspa, hukmanta niy.
You’re not always like that.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna kanki.
I mean, he’s great.	Niyta munani, payqa hatunmi.
There’s almost nothing there.	Chaypiqa yaqa mana imapas kanchu.
There is a man there.	Huk runam chaypi kachkan.
Yes that is easy to do.	Arí chayta ruwayqa facilmi.
I never knew it was that bad.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna millay kasqanmantaqa.
So, hurry up!!!.	Chaymi, utqaylla!!!.
They didn’t seem nervous or unhappy.	Paykunaqa manan mancharisqa hinachu karqanku nitaq mana kusisqachu karqanku.
Everything is too fast and too much.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqaylla, llumpay.
I never knew it would be like this.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kayna kananta.
He could never have had that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa atinmanchu karqan.
I can’t believe it either.	Ñuqapas manam creeyta atinichu.
A couple, now and then that’s it.	Huk iskay, kunan chaymanta chaylla.
He held it tight.	Payqa sinchitan hap’irqan.
Difficult to learn.	Sasa yachay.
He realized he wasn’t alone.	Payqa repararqanmi mana sapallanchu kashasqanmanta.
I couldn't stand it anymore.	Chaytaqa manañam aguantayta atirqanichu.
If you know how to.	Sichus yachanki imaynatachus chayta.
One or the other must be fired.	Huknin utaq hukninmi qarqusqa kanan.
So, a year, maybe two.	Chaymi, huk wata, ichapas iskay.
Since then, not so much.	Chaymanta pacha, mana anchatachu.
Or the house.	Utaq wasi.
A wise speaker.	Yachaysapa rimaq.
It doesn’t make anything better.	Manam imatapas aswan allintachu ruwan.
I want to talk to you.	Rimayta munani.
It didn't really seem that cold.	Manam chiqaptaqa chayna chiri hinachu karqa.
He was always too fast.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi nishuta usqhaylla ruwaq.
I will never be happier or happier.	Manam haykapipas aswan kusisqachu nitaq aswan kusisqachu kasaq.
It really worked out that way for him.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hinata paypaq allin karqan.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
One probably thinks about it.	Huk runaqa yaqapaschá chaypiqa yuyaykun.
I was really crazy about it.	Chiqaptam chaymanta loco karqani.
It’s just so amazing.	Chaylla ancha admirakuypaqmi.
I wonder when it's good for him.	Tapukuni hayk'aqmi paypaq allin kasqanmanta.
You know you don't.	Yachankim mana chayta ruwasqaykita.
I hope he was happy.	Suyachkani kusisqa kasqanmanta.
Both are really good.	Iskayninkum chiqap allin kanku.
It was actually pretty easy.	Chiqaptaqa ancha facilmi karqa.
A handsome adult.	Huk sumaq rikchayniyuq hatun runa.
And then a week.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk semana.
He can’t answer that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa kutichiyta atinmanchu.
Don’t do it again.	Ama hukmanta ruwaychu.
I can’t do anything about that right now.	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa ima ruwaytapas atiymanchu.
Today was an easier day.	Kunan punchawqa aswan facil punchawmi karqa.
This seems very good.	Kayqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
That would be so easy.	Chayqa ancha facilmi kanman.
A girl is the one.	Huk sipasmi chay.
The best thing for you.	Aswan allin kaq qampaq.
Actually, it’s pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allin.
Harder than expected.	Suyasqanmanta aswan sasa.
If you think about it, that’s fine.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
Disagree like many people.	Askha runakuna hina mana acuerdopi kay.
One day everything would be better.	Huk punchawmi tukuy imapas aswan allin kanman.
Great performance indeed.	Hatun ruway chiqap.
Something that has always been very important to me.	Imapas ñawpaqmantaraqmi ancha importante karqa ñuqapaq.
He couldn’t be this stupid.	Payqa manan kay sonso kayta atirqanchu.
Nobody does that about it.	Manam pipas chaymanta chaynataqa ruwanchu.
But he doesn’t have to.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwananchu.
He acted like a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqaptam sumaq runa hina ruwarqa.
Otherwise, it’s not worth it.	Mana chayqa, manan valenchu.
I know that sounds simple.	Yachanim chayqa mana sasachu uyarikun.
Now they are more intelligent.	Kunanqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Here was the truth.	Kaypim chiqap kaq karqa.
It looked like a lot of one like that.	Chayqa rikchakurqa achka huk chayna.
I’m just there right away.	Chayllam chaypi kachkani.
If you want to go, go.	Riyta munaspaqa riy.
Very early, obviously.	Ancha temprano, sut’inmi.
But it was like yesterday.	Ichaqa qayna punchaw hinam karqa.
It’s very, very big.	Ancha ancha hatunmi.
Clearly not.'	Sut’inmi mana’, nispa.
So he got out of there quickly.	Chaymi chaymanta utqaylla lluqsirqa.
She was always there, always ready to help him.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa, sapa kutim listo karqa payta yanapananpaq.
We're actually pretty excited about it.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkaniku.
Everyday thing, this.	Sapa punchaw imapas, kay.
But it certainly looks nice.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sumaq rikch’akun.
He did it twice as fast.	Payqa iskay kutita utqaylla ruwarqa.
In a large house.	Hatun wasipi.
I am an adult here.	Kaypi kuraq runam kani.
I know exactly what he did.	Allintam yachani ima ruwasqanmanta.

They are very curious.	Paykunaqa anchatam yachayta munanku.
At least, he thought it was.	Aswanpas, payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay hina kananpaq.
That’s obviously very, very important.	Chayqa sut’inmi ancha, ancha importante.
It quickly died down.	Chayqa usqhayllan wañupurqan.
I've got some things.	Wakin imakunatapas hap'ini.
I'm doing this.	Kayta ruwachkani.
There was no beauty.	Manam sumaq kayqa karqachu.
He was not the man.	Payqa manam chay runachu karqa.
In fact, he really never did.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta mana hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
I don't think it's a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu kasqanmantam piensani.
I can probably tell you why.	Yaqapaschá niyta atiyman imarayku chayta.
Almost, at least.	Yaqa, aswanpas.
Hopefully you can go.	Munaymanmi riyta atisqaykita.
But he had to go later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi rinan karqan.
That’s something he never thought about.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu.
I know you are disappointed.	Yachanim hukmanyasqa kasqaykita.
I like him the best for that.	Chaypaqqa paymi aswan allinta gustan.
He says he’s worried about you.	Qanmanta llakisqa kashasqanmanta nin.
I don't feel so good anymore.	Manañam chayna allintachu sientekuni.
However, they are human beings.	Ichaqa, paykunaqa runan kanku.
One of them will be next year.	Hukninmi hamuq wata kanqa.
It was a really nice morning.	Chiqamanta sumaq paqarin karqa.
Do it better, faster, and better .	Aswan allinta, aswan utqaylla, aswan allinta ruway .
That was the sure thing.	Chayqa seguro kaqmi karqa.
But he thought it through.	Ichaqa allintan yuyaykurqan.
You didn’t really do it.	Manam chiqaptachu ruwarqanki.
He knew how to convince.	Payqa yacharqanmi imaynatas convencechiyta.
You never knew what the future held.	Manan hayk’aqpas yacharqankichu imachus hamuq tiempopi kananta.
Everything is nice and went well.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi, allintam rirqa.
But probably not much longer.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana aswan unaytachu.
This would be faster.	Kayqa aswan utqayllam kanman.
Go for a walk outside.	Hawaman puriq riy.
Ten years ago, he wouldn't have to.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa manas chayta ruwananchu karqa.
I have a few ideas of what it might be.	Ñuqaqa iskay kimsa yuyayniyuq kani imachus kanman chaymanta.
No idea what’s wrong.	Mana yuyayniyuq ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
Like great, anyway.	Hatun hina, imayna kaptinpas.
He is always in town.	Sapa kutim llaqtapi kachkan.
I mean, you know somewhere.	Niyta munani, maypipas yachanki.
It was actually pretty big.	Chiqaptaqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
I want to go somewhere.	Maymanpas riyta munani.
I didn’t expect it to be this good.	Manam suyarqanichu kayna allin kananta.
But maybe it’s something.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas kanman.
This one is fairly easy.	Kayqa allin facilmi.
Somewhere, maybe, but most certainly not here.	Maypipas, ichapas, ichaqa aswan seguro mana kaypichu.
Baby him a little bit.	Wawa payta huk chikan.
Everything in the city is worse.	Llaqtapiqa tukuy imapas aswan mana allinmi.

He sure wasn't ready to talk to her yet.	Payqa seguro manaraq listochu kasharqan paywan rimananpaq.
This needs to be done here.	Kaytaqa kaypim ruwana.
Something bad happened that night.	Chay tutam imapas mana allin pasarqa.

That means now.	Chayqa kunan niyta munan.
He wasn't really sure why.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu seguro kasharqan imarayku chayta.
This is a bit surprising.	Kayqa huk chikan admirakuypaqmi.
And it’s going to be funny.	Hinaspa asikunapaq hina kanqa.
I'd rather he didn't.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chayta ruwaptinqa.
This process was very uncomfortable.	Kay ruwayqa ancha mana allinchu karqa.
And it’s bigger.	Hinaspa aswan hatun.
But this was it.	Ichaqa kaymi karqan.
Did a day trip.	Huk punchaw puriyta ruwarqa.
So maybe a baby.	Chaymi ichapas huk wawa.
Yes, no, he says.	Arí mana, nispas nin.
That’s not true.	Chayqa mana cheqaqchu.
You’re a fool.	Qamqa mana yuyayniyuq.
When all is well, I want the best.	Tukuy imapas allin kaptinqa aswan allintam munani.
People were there for it.	Runakuna chaypi karqanku.
He couldn’t find it anywhere.	Manas maypipas tariyta atirqachu.
No, the truth is more, more important.	Manan, cheqaq kaqmi aswan, aswan allinqa.
I don’t want to talk about this anymore.	Manañam kaymantaqa rimayta munanichu.
I can't say yes now.	Kunanqa manam arí niyta atiymanchu.
Please be realistic.	Ama hina kaspa, chiqap yuyayniyuq kay.
I know this is all the wrong time.	Yachanim kayqa tukuy mana allin pacha kasqanmanta.
I am a single person person.	Ñuqaqa sapallan runa runam kani.
He certainly didn’t want to be.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hina kayta munarqanchu.
Everyone is included here.	Kaypiqa llapa runam churasqa kachkan.
There was something there, all right.	Chaypin imapas kasqa, allinmi.
But his name was there.	Ichaqa sutinmi chaypi kasqa.
Every day is something new.	Sapa punchawmi imapas musuq kaq.
Didn't do much else.	Mana anchatachu hukta ruwarqan.
It’s certainly better together.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allin kuska.
I am as guilty as you are.	Ñoqapas qan hinan huchayoq kani.
Maybe you want to make sure from me that everything is fine.	Ichapas ñuqamanta seguro kayta munanki, tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta.
You are just ridiculous.	Qamqa asikunapaq hinallam kanki.
This week, that is.	Kay semanapi, chaymi.
We really shouldn't do it right.	Chiqaptam mana allintachu ruwananchik.
I could still look pretty.	Hinallam sumaq rikchayniyuq kayta atiyman karqa.
They were really disappointed he wasn't here.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam hukmanyasqa karqaku mana kaypi kasqanmanta.
You are as good as anyone.	Pipas hina allinmi kanki.
This is just another me.	Kayqa huk ñuqallam.
Can't find what the problem is.	Mana tariyta atinchu ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
More, now, more.	Aswan, kunan, aswan.
But nowhere near fast enough.	Ichaqa manan maypipas usqhayllachu.
This one seems rather interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi rikchakun.
But this was the most important thing.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan importante kaqmi karqan.
Something, like, that.	Imapas, hina, chay.
Everything he didn’t do.	Tukuy ima mana ruwasqanmanta.
But he had to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
If he still has to do it.	Hinallam ruwanan kaptinqa.
He couldn't stop doing it alone.	Payqa manam sapallan ruwaytaqa saqiyta atirqachu.
I knew the worst.	Aswan mana allintam yacharqani.
Maybe it was more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka karqa.
And those people.	Hinaspa chay runakuna.
It’s so ugly.	Chayna millay.
But that’s what it should be.	Ichaqa chaymi kanan.
What to do about it.	Imatataq chaymanta ruwana.
He went to school there.	Chaypim escuelaman rirqa.
Everyone is happy.	Llapallankum kusisqa kachkanku.
He wasn’t sure who he wanted to work with.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan piwan llank’ayta munasqanmanta.
I don’t want to be here anymore.	Manañam kaypi kayta munanichu.
I know you’re right, but .	Yachanim allinta nisqaykita, ichaqa .
This was not good at all.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa ni imapipas.
It won’t be true.	Mana cheqaqchu kanqa.
That may not make sense.	Chayqa manapaschá imapaqpas valenchu.
By doing a lot of things.	Achka ruwaykunata ruwaspa.
If something doesn’t work, stop doing it.	Imapas mana allin kaptinqa, amaña ruwaychu.
Therefore, we need to play a role here.	Chayraykum kaypi huk ruwayta ruwananchik.
This was too bad.	Kayqa llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
He looked at her again.	Payqa yapamanta qhawarisqa.
All well-informed.	Tukuy allin yachaysapa.
They know it’s me.	Paykunaqa yachanku ñoqa kasqayta.
I want to be anonymous again.	Hukmanta mana riqsisqa kayta munani.

Two weeks alone.	Iskay semana sapallan.
But of course he was.	Ichaqa sut’inmi payqa karqan.
What do you mean by that.	Ima niyta munanki.
However, he did not elaborate on his plans.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu willarqan chay yuyaykusqanmanta.
That everybody got out of there.	Chay tukuy runa chaymanta lluqsirqa.
This he never had any intention of doing.	Kaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ima ruwaytapas yuyaykurqanchu.
It’s never a bad thing.	Manam haykapipas mana allinchu.
It’s all good, though.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, ichaqa.
But we agree it’s wrong.	Ichaqa acuerdopi kayku mana allin kasqanmanta.
Yes he is a good guy.	Arí payqa allin runam.
You will be successful in everything.	Tukuy imapipas allinmi kanki.

I think that’s pretty bad.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
You are doing this very well.	Kaytaqa ancha allintam ruwachkanki.
It’s best as everyday clothes.	Sapa punchaw p’acha hinam aswan allinqa.

If you don’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa.

You can't see it.	Qamqa manam qawayta atiwaqchu.
But here, no, not really.	Ichaqa kaypi, manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
He might have been a baseball player.	Payqa yaqapaschá béisbol pukllaq kanman karqan.
There must be wealth somewhere.	Maypipas qhapaq kaymi kanan.
He’s been gone for a long time.	Unayñan ripurqan.

He was soon dismissed.	Pisi tiempollamantan qarqosqa karqan.
I didn’t know you could do it.	Manam yacharqanichu ruwayta atisqaykita.
But of course they weren’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqanku.

No seriously, it's not that hard.	Mana serio, manam chayna sasachu.
Yes, he certainly was.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin payqa chay hina karqan.
Today and, more importantly, tomorrow.	Kunan punchaw hinaspa, aswan allinqa, paqarin punchaw.
So, it didn’t work out.	Chaymi, mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Have some common sense.	Wakin allin yuyayniyuq kay.
Where they were together, they were together.	Maypichus kuska karqanku chaypiqa kuska karqanku.
It doesn’t do anything.	Mana ima ruwaytapas ruwanchu.
It wasn’t there.	Manam karqanchu.
There didn’t seem to be anyone.	Manas pipas kanman hinachu karqan.
He thinks he can have everything.	Payqa piensanmi tukuy imapas paypaq kananta.
I didn’t want to hold it.	Manam hapiyta munarqanichu.
Don't care why.	Ama imananpaschu imarayku.
He couldn't play.	Payqa manam pukllayta atirqachu.
But this was it.	Ichaqa kayqa karqan.
You’re still worried.	Hinallam llakisqa kanki.
We did a bit of everything.	Tukuy imatam huk chhikanta ruwarqayku.
At least that’s what he said.	Aswanpas chaytan payqa nirqan.
This doesn’t matter.	Kayqa manam imananpaschu.
It wasn’t all bad.	Manam tukuy mana allinchu karqa.
At least, it’s just.	Aswanpas, chayllaraqmi.
Never really thought about it though.	Mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu chaypi yuyaykurqan ichaqa.
But so far he hasn’t been able to.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan atirqanchu.
I don’t like that they’re too big.	Manam gustawanchu ancha hatun kasqankuta.
I know how badly he wants it.	Yachanim imayna millay munasqanmanta.
They were so great.	Paykunaqa ancha hatunmi karqanku.
I know that it exists.	Yachanim chay kasqanmanta.
I’ll do better, better, or I don’t care.	Aswan allinta, aswan allinta ruwasaq, mana chayqa manan imananpaschu.
Here, we cannot do that.	Kaypiqa, manam chaytaqa ruwayta atichwanchu.
He was not in the car with us.	Payqa manan ñoqaykuwan kuskachu carropi kasharqan.
He knew it was the best.	Payqa yacharqanmi aswan allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe he’s really happy.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni kusisqa kanman.
I was happy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa kusisqam karqani.
It would make him happier.	Aswan kusisqan paytaqa ruwanman.

He wasn’t up to this.	Payqa manan kayman hinachu karqan.
It was very uncomfortable to say the least.	Ancha mana allinchu karqan rimanaypaq.
He looked at her carefully.	Payqa allintan qhawarisqa.

And right now, that’s good for you.	Hinaspa kunanpacha, chayqa allinmi qanpaq.
That means they are ready.	Chayqa listoña kasqankuta niyta munan.

It’s sad, but it’s beautiful.	Llakikuypaqmi, ichaqa sumaqmi.
He barely noticed it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta qhawarirqan.

Maybe he knew it was going to happen.	Ichapas chay pasananta yacharqa.
No one else can play this role.	Kay ruwaytaqa manam pipas huk pukllayta atinmanchu.
Don’t do that to me.	Ama chaynataqa ruwaychu.
They were not so easily unsettled.	Paykunaqa manan chay hina facilchu mana tiyaq karqanku.
But here they are.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkanku.
For being a very strong person.	Anchata sinchi runa kasqaymanta.
He looked tired but happy.	Payqa sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa ichaqa kusisqa.
Be sure not to be popular.	Aswan seguro mana ancha riqsisqa kay.
About three weeks.	Yaqa kimsa semana.
They seemed angry.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa hinam karqaku.
One by one and one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta hukmanta.
It wouldn’t be too difficult.	Manam ancha sasachu kanman.
He is like three.	Payqa kimsa hinam kachkan.
I already had a second name.	Ñam iskay kaq sutiyuq karqani.
So it's a pretty great day.	Chaymi sumaq hatun punchaw.
I didn’t expect to hear from you.	Manam suyarqanichu qammanta uyariyta.

I’m afraid they aren’t.	Manchakuni mana kasqankuta.
Yeah, you know those things.	Arí, chaykunataqa yachanki.
I don’t think much of anything.	Manam anchatachu imatapas piensani.
It was beautiful and beautiful.	Sumaq hinaspa sumaqmi karqa.
He spent some time in prison.	Huk tiempon carcelpi karqan.
So far I have been going every other day.	Kunankamaqa sapa iskay punchawmi rirqani.
That was the best thing that ever happened to him.	Chayqa aswan allinmi paypaq karqa.
If something makes sense to you, do it.	Imapas qampaq hina kaptinqa chayta ruway.
I don't think it's anywhere.	Mana maypipas kasqanmantam piensani.
It’s available to you now.	Kunanmi qampaq kachkan.

That was very clear.	Chay nisqanqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
But it’s something like this.	Ichaqa kay hina kaqmi.
I am not sure about this.	Kaymantaqa manam segurochu kani.
This is obviously not a good thing to do.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allin ruwaychu.
Do you really think this is going to happen.	¿Cheqaqtachu yuyaykunki kay hina kananta.
That doesn’t mean it doesn’t mean that.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana chayta niyta munanchu.
I mean, this is great.	Niyta munani, kayqa ancha allinmi.
He knows where nothing is.	Payqa yachanmi maypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
And you want those things.	Hinaspa chaykunataqa munanki.
Don’t be a child.	Ama wawa kaychu.
Okay it doesn’t mean that.	Allinmi mana chaytachu niyta munan.

Go on, be happy.	Riy, kusisqa kay.
It seems safe.	Seguro hinam.
It’s been a great year.	Hatun watañam karqa.
I felt comfortable.	Allinmi tarikurqani.
But there was one mistake.	Ichaqa huk pantasqa karqan.
It’s so amazing how young he is.	Ancha admirakuypaqmi imayna wayna kasqanmanta.
He wasn’t a human being.	Payqa manan runachu karqan.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Mana allinchu imatapas ruwayqa.
That's right, it's just really not a big deal.	Chayqa, chayllam chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu.
He couldn’t keep up with her.	Payqa manan paywan kuska puriyta atirqanchu.
Someone told him.	Pipas payta nisqa.
I learned a lot.	Anchatam yacharqani.
Then again, he doesn’t have time.	Chaymanta yapamanta, mana tiempon kanchu.
I still like it.	Hinallam gustan.

It felt like three days.	Kimsa punchaw hinam tarikurqa.
He was a stranger here.	Payqa kaypi mana riqsisqa runam karqa.

Everything is beautiful.	Tukuy imapas sumaq sumaqmi.
So yeah, really happy to be here.	Chaymi arí, chiqap kusisqa kaypi kasqaymanta.
He said he didn't think so.	Payqa nirqam mana chayna piensasqanmanta.
It talks about this, nothing.	Kaymanta, mana imamanta riman.
Where are you going.	Mayman rinki.
But, it’s not always easy.	Ichaqa, manan sapa kutichu facil.
It doesn’t always have to be that way.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanan.
There, that’s it.	Chaypi, chaymi.
Be tough out there.	Chay hawapi sinchi kay.
Perhaps he was discouraged.	Ichapas payqa hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
Lots of food there.	Achka mikhuy chaypi.
That was supposed to be amazing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi kanan karqa.
He would have to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan kanman karqan.
This can be a complicated and difficult process.	Kayqa huk sasa hinaspa sasa ruwaymi kanman.
I don’t want to hear it anymore.	Manañam uyariyta munanichu.
He said he wouldn't do it.	Paymi nirqa mana ruwasaqchu nispa.
He was good at what he did.	Payqa allintam ruwasqanpi karqa.
I wanted to leave after that.	Chay qhepamanmi ripuyta munarqani.
They are all really disappointed.	Llapallankum chiqap hukmanyasqa kachkanku.
But everything seemed fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
Alone again alone.	Sapallan yapamanta sapallan.
He doesn’t do that now.	Kunanqa manan chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I don’t think so now.	Kunanqa manan chaytachu yuyaykuni.
This feature seems very interesting.	Kay ruwayqa ancha munaymanmi rikchakun.
I always want to do the right thing.	Sapa kutim allinta ruwayta munani.
You can keep doing it.	Qamqa hinallam ruwawaq.
It was a learning day, after all.	Yachay punchawmi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
But you’re not being ridiculous.	Ichaqa manan asikunapaq hinachu kashanki.
Most importantly, he’s a good guy.	Aswan allinqa, payqa allin runam.
All very interesting and informative.	Tukuy ancha sumaq hinaspa yachachiq.
Maybe it used to be, but not anymore.	Ichapas ñawpaqtaqa karqa, ichaqa manañam.
Okay, here's the thing.	Allinmi, kaypim kachkan chay imapas.
Now he was hungry.	Kunanqa yarqaymanta kasqa.
The bad one, for sure.	Mana allin kaq, seguro.
That's like the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allin kaq hinam.
And that’s a difficult thing to do.	Hinaspa chayqa sasa ruwaymi.
It’s always there.	Tukuy tiempo kan.
Didn't anyone say.	Nirqanchu mana pipas.

Do the job right.	Allinta llamk’ayta ruway.
But a handsome man nonetheless.	Ichaqa sumaq rikchayniyuq runa chayna kaptinpas.

Don’t ever do it.	Ama hayk’aqpas ruwaychu.

Even so, you might want to double check.	Chayna kaptinpas ichapas iskay kutita qawayta munanki.
Everyone was there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa llapallankum chaypi karqaku.
He opened the back door.	Payqa qhipa punkuta kicharirqa.

You think you’re going to do the right thing.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqmi yuyaykunki.
No one could do anything about it.	Manan pipas ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
That held up well, at least.	Chayqa allinta hap’irqan, aswanpas.
I am deeply disappointed.	Sinchitan hukmanyasqa kashani.
It came, he realized, from him.	Chayqa hamurqan, payqa repararqanmi, paymanta.
Otherwise, maybe not so much.	Mana chayqa, ichapas mana anchatachu.

He wanted it yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi munarqa.
This is not a good place for that.	Chaypaqqa manan kayqa allinchu.
He wanted her to be okay now.	Payqa munarqanmi kunan allin kananta.
Now the other one.	Kunanqa huknin.
It wasn’t bad, actually.	Manam mana allinchu karqa, chiqaptaqa.
It was a little uncomfortable.	Huk chikan mana allinchu karqa.
You are here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi kachkanki.
He couldn't wait to hear it.	Manas suyayta atirqachu uyariyta.
It wasn’t really like that.	Manam chiqaptachu chayna karqa.
The man knew this.	Chay runaqa kaytam yacharqa.
I can’t do it right.	Manam allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
He didn’t know what was right for him.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus paypaq allin kaqta.
That was in the past.	Chayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He still wasn't sure.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kachkarqa.
You don’t want to go outside.	Manam munankichu hawaman lluqsiyta.
But he couldn’t remember where.	Ichaqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu maypi.
I really don’t want to be.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta munanichu.
This thing is pretty hard.	Kay imapas ancha sinchi.
In fact, it says much more than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymanta aswan achkatam nin.
You can never be too sure.	Manan hayk’aqpas nishuta seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
I didn't care if he ever did.	Manam imananpaschu karqa haykapipas ruwaptinqa.
He knew exactly where he wanted to go.	Payqa allintam yacharqa mayman riyta munasqanmanta.
It was so nice to be alone for a while.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan huk rato sapallay kayqa.
It can be very lonely.	Ancha sapallanmi kanman.
He doesn’t care who he is.	Payqa manan imananpaschu pi kasqanmantaqa.
A second chance.	Iskay kaq chansa.
I have no idea what’s going on.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna kasqanmanta.
I wish I had known about it earlier.	Munayman karqan ñawpaqta chaymanta yachayta.
He doesn’t always like it.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chayta gustan.
This needs someone to be smart about it.	Kayqa necesitan pipas chaymanta yachaysapa kananta.
This should do what you want.	Kayqa munasqaykita ruwanan tiyan.
For the sake of everything.	Tukuy ima allin kananpaq.
What’s worse, they know how to fix it.	Imataq aswan mana allinqa, paykunaqa yachanku allichayta.
I feel terrible about it.	Chaymantaqa sinchitan sientekuni.
I thought you wanted him to know.	Yuyarqanim yachananta munanki nispa.
But if you want to do this it’s fine with me.	Ichaqa kayta ruwayta munanki chayqa allinmi ñuqawan.
That sounds really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi uyarikun.
He wasn't there anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam chaypichu karqa.
I'm not sure where to go on this though.	Manam segurochu kani mayman rinaypaq kaymanta ichaqa.
He can’t stand it anymore.	Payqa manañan aguantayta atinchu.
That may not be a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allintachu kanman.
What a strange day it is.	Ima mana riqsisqa punchawmi.
He was happy for a while.	Payqa huk tiempon kusisqa kasharqan.
Sick child.	Unqusqa wawa.
You seem to be happy.	Kusisqa hinam kanki.
I’m sorry about all that.	Tukuy chaymanta llakikuni.
So here they were.	Chaymi kaypi karqaku.
Find out what is causing it.	Imataq chayta ruwachkan chayta yachay.
I don't really know what the problem is here.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani ima sasachakuy kaypi kasqanmanta.
And he did and it was amazing.	Hinaspa ruwarqa hinaspa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
So it was not a good day.	Chaymi mana allin punchawchu karqa.
I wanted to see him that night.	Chay tutan payta rikuyta munarqani.
I meant, you know, everybody.	Niyta munarqani, yachanki, llapa runa.
He could not give them up.	Chaykunataqa manam saqiyta atirqachu.
Like someone walking around.	Pipas puriq hina.
To do this alone.	Kayta sapallan ruwananpaq.
He always failed me.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi mana allintachu ruwawaq.
He’s crazy, that one.	Payqa loco, chay huknin.
But it may not be what he wants.	Ichaqa manapaschá munasqanman hinachu kanman.
I think you can tell.	Yuyaykuni willayta atisqaykita.
Good, bad, and ugly!.	¡Allin, mana allin, millay ima!.
Three months ago.	Kimsa killa ñawpaqta.
That’s not an easy thing to do.	Chayqa manan facilchu ruwayqa.
I know a lot more about myself now.	Kunanqa aswan achkatam ñuqamanta yachani.
It's crazy.	Loco kanan.
Every day more and more.	Sapa punchawmi aswan achkata.
In fact, this has been going on all along.	Aswanpas kayqa tukuy tiempon kashan.
You don’t know how to understand it.	Manan yachankichu imaynatachus chayta entiendeyta.
I know where you live.	Yachanim maypi yachasqaykita.
He had to do the wrong thing.	Payqa chay mana allintam ruwanan karqa.
They have no idea who is who and what is what.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanku pichus pi kasqanmanta, imataq ima kasqanmanta.
I thought you had a good idea.	Yuyarqanim allin yuyayniyuq kanki nispa.
Perhaps he thought of it himself.	Yaqapaschá pay kikin chaypi yuyaykurqan.
It was easy like that.	Chay hinaqa facilmi karqan.
So if it’s mine.	Chaymi ñuqapa kaptinqa.
He was amazing though.	Payqa ichaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I couldn’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu.
He felt like he used to.	Payqa ñawpaq hinam tarikurqa.
This is not good for you.	Kayqa manam allinchu qampaq.
Nothing can stop it now.	Kunanqa manan imapas chayta hark’ayta atinmanchu.
There are not many people there.	Chaypiqa manam achka runakunaqa kanchu.
I just couldn’t do it to do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu chayta ruwanaypaq.
I don’t want one like that, thank you.	Manam munanichu hukta chaynataqa, gracias.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Payqa allintan yacharqan imatachus munasqanmanta.
No one knew who you were.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu pi kasqaykita.
There they are, the people.	Chaypim kachkanku, chay runakuna.
He felt like he did.	Payqa hinam tarikurqa.
He wants to succeed and be the best.	Payqa munanmi allinta ruwayta hinaspa aswan allin kayta.
What will happen tomorrow.	Imataq paqarin kanqa.
I'm afraid, but that's not all.	Manchakuni, ichaqa manam chayllachu.
He really seemed to want to help.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yanapayta munanman hina karqan.
But she is a great girl.	Ichaqa hatun sipasmi.
That would take a lot of time.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon kanan karqan.
He sounds like such a nice guy.	Payqa chayna sumaq runa hinam uyarikun.
That’s what he did.	Chaytam ruwarqa.
If you weren’t happy enough.	Sichus mana allintachu kusisqa karqanki chayqa.
The process here is easy.	Kaypi ruwayqa facilmi.
And he wanted to do it now.	Hinaspa kunan ruwayta munarqa.
We barely talked.	Yaqapaschá rimaq kayku.
He was there all morning.	Payqa tukuy paqarinmi chaypi karqa.
I’m a little proud of that, it’s great.	Chaywanmi huk chhikanta orgulloso kani, ancha allinmi.
This was a good decade ago.	Kayqa allin chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
The man just said.	Chayllaraqmi chay runaqa nisqa.
He didn't need that now.	Chaytaqa manan kunan necesitarqanchu.
He died three days ago.	Payqa kinsa p’unchay ñawpaqtaraqmi wañupurqan.
Almost no one there, ever.	Yaqa mana pipas chaypi, hayk’aqpas.
I have no idea what he means.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I wouldn’t be able to go.	Manam riyta atiymanchu karqa.
So, it’s pretty big.	Chaymi, ancha hatunmi.
If it’s too good to be true, probably.	Sichus ancha allin kanman chayqa, yaqapaschá.
But no one wanted them.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaykunataqa munarqanchu.
I could tell you exactly.	Allintam willayta atiyman karqa.
But that may not be true.	Ichaqa manapaschá chayqa cheqaqchu kanman.
He’s tired and frustrated.	Payqa sayk’usqa, hukmanyasqa ima kachkan.
Like a new baby.	Musuq wawa hina.
He doesn’t want to talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta munanchu.
We cannot walk away from here.	Kaymantaqa manam puriyta atichwanchu.
The smart guy.	Chay yachaysapa wayna.
I don’t understand that at all.	Chaytaqa manan imapipas entiendenichu.
It must be quick.	Usqhaylla kanan tiyan.
That was some of the process.	Chayqa wakin ruwaymi karqa.
These are reasonable people.	Kayqa allin yuyayniyuq runakunam.
This is one of them.	Kaymi huknin.
There is a need to do this.	Chaypaqqa allintan ruwana.
She was very nice to him.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi paypaq karqa.
It seemed kind of sad.	Chayqa huk laya llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
I want it to be beautiful.	Munani sumaq kananta.
They were all day.	Tukuy punchawmi karqaku.
It was hard to say.	Sasam karqa niyta.
I didn’t hear it.	Mana uyarirqanichu.
He seems very happy though.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakun ichaqa.
He's probably better off anyway.	Payqa ichapas aswan allin kachkan imayna kaptinpas.
He looked very disappointed.	Payqa ancha hukmanyasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He used to be a good guy.	Ñawpaqtaqa allin runam karqa.
I am not like that now.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu kani.
Learn how to say it.	Imayna niyta yachay.
All evening.	Tukuy chisi.
He looked very hurt.	Payqa ancha k’irisqa hinan qhawarisqa.
Very quickly like that.	Ancha utqaylla chayna hina.
He couldn't tell what it was.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
Still not sure how that happened.	Hinallam mana segurochu imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
It looks like itself.	Kikin rikchakun.
Maybe not, maybe yes.	Ichapas mana, ichapas arí.
It’s better here.	Aswan allinmi kaypi.
Later, he wanted to talk about it.	Qhepamanmi chaymanta rimayta munarqan.
It is better to act quickly.	Aswan allinmi usqhaylla ruwayqa.
Real food.	Chiqap mikhuy.
He knew exactly where they were.	Payqa allintam yacharqa maypi kasqankuta.
They were all in prison.	Llapallankum carcelpi karqaku.
He doesn’t care about that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa imananpaschu.
No, that’s not it.	Manan, chaymi mana.
But it is not the	Ichaqa manan chay .
Someone else did this.	Huk runam kayta ruwarqa.
No one else could have done that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa atinmanchu karqan.
I don’t want to fix it.	Manam allichayta munanichu.
I know you're hurt and angry.	Yachanin k'irisqa, phiñasqa kasqaykita.
This can often be difficult.	Chay ruwayqa sapa kutim sasa kanman.
It’s that beautiful.	Chayna sumaqmi.
Mary was so great.	Mariaqa ancha hatunmi karqa.
Everything is according to his will.	Tukuy imapas munasqanman hinam.
Not like today.	Mana kunan punchaw hinachu.
He looked worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
But, he doesn’t know that.	Ichaqa, manan chaytaqa yachanchu.
A head was there.	Huk uma chaypi kasqa.
I thought he looked good.	Allin rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Nothing really mattered anymore.	Manañan imapas cheqaqtachu importante karqan.
He’s not the same as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu.
Go now.	Kunan riy.
It seemed to go well.	Allinta puriq hinam karqa.
And so on and so forth.	Chay hinata chay hinata.
He was always in trouble.	Sapa kutim sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
I don’t do that very often.	Chaytaqa manan ancha sapa kutichu ruwani.
It was cold, probably morning.	Chiri karqan, yaqapaschá paqarin.
But don’t do this.	Ichaqa ama kayta ruwaychu.
You’re going to do it.	Qamqa ruwanki.
It doesn’t have to be everyone.	Manan llapa runachu kanan.
It’s a good morning.	Allintam paqarin.
And he was just fired.	Hinaspa chayllaraq qarqusqa karqa.
Obviously, a lot.	Sut’inmi, askha.
You’ll love the answer.	Kutichiyta anchata munanki.
He was always frustrated.	Payqa sapa kutim hukmanyasqa tarikurqa.
Please tell the truth.	Ama hina kaspa, cheqaq kaqta willay.
No one had ever done that to him.	Manan pipas chaytaqa hayk’aqpas paytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I'm still hoping it doesn't happen at all.	Hinallam suyachkani mana imapipas pasananta.
But we are very happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqam kachkaniku.
I thought he might be.	Yuyarqanim payqa kanman nispa.
Of course, do it.	Chiqamanta, ruway.
He did, on several occasions.	Chaynatam ruwarqa, achka kutipi.
He had to keep going.	Payqa hinallam rinan karqa.
They weren’t sure.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu karqanku.
He looked at her very hard.	Payqa ancha sinchitan qhawarisqa.
Obviously this was a bad thing to do.	Sut’inmi kayqa mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
It means bigger money.	Astawan hatun qullqita niyta munan.
He looks great now.	Payqa kunanqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
I thought maybe it would be good.	Yuyarqanim ichapas allin kanman nispa.
He told me where and when.	Paymi niwarqa maypi hinaspa haykapi.
And summer here is beautiful.	Hinaspa verano kaypi sumaq.
Great great beautiful.	Hatun hatun sumaq.
That was a long time ago now.	Chayqa unayñan karqan kunanqa.
You don’t think like a crazy person.	Manan loco runa hinachu yuyaykunki.
He's actually there now.	Payqa chiqaptaqa kunanmi chaypi kachkan.
He was too easy.	Payqa llumpay facilmi karqa.
If they’re tough, great.	Sichus sinchi kanku chayqa, hatunmi.
Regardless of the outside.	Imayna hawapi kaptinpas.
He was where he wasn’t.	Payqa maypichus mana chaypichu kasharqan.
I think you can do better.	Aswan allinta ruwayta atisqaykita yuyaykuni.
But it’s really the latter.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin qhepa kaq ruwayqa.
That was about a decade ago.	Chayqa yaqa chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
Then the other half.	Chaymanta huk kuskan.
Is this the right thing to do.	¿Kaychu allin ruway.
It would have been a good thing.	Allin ruwaymi kanman karqan.
For example,   .	Kay hina, .
I couldn’t go to school.	Manam yachay wasiman riyta atirqanichu.
I wanted to hear what he did.	Chay ruwasqanmanta uyariyta munarqani.
It was the best thing that ever happened to him.	Chayqa aswan allin kaqmi karqa paywan pasasqanmantaqa.
Now that is very difficult.	Kunanqa chayqa ancha sasam.
We need to continue here.	Kaypiqa hinallam ruwananchik.
And now you know most of the story.	Hinaspa kunanqa yaqa llapan willakuyta yachanki.
He refused to listen.	Mana uyariyta munarqanchu.
It can’t be that hard, you know.	Manam chayna sasachu kanman, yachanki.
Maybe he’s not what he wants.	Ichapas payqa mana munasqanman hinachu.
He immediately knew something was wrong.	Payqa chayllam yacharqa imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I didn’t know about anything.	Manam imamantapas yacharqanichu.
Eat regular meals.	Sapa kuti mikhunata mikhuy.
This is what we both agree on.	Kaymi iskayninku acuerdopi kayku.
I know what he needs.	Yachanim ima necesitasqanmanta.
So this should take about an hour.	Chaymi chaypaqqa huk hora hina tiempota ruwana.
That was a good thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa allinmi karqa.
He said he wanted to help.	Paymi yanapayta munasqanmanta nirqa.
He is truly a treasure.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin huk qhapaq kay.
It’s not like someone who hasn’t been hurt.	Manan mana k’irisqa runa hinachu.
They are not worth it.	Paykunaqa manan valenchu.
It seemed to do it.	Chayqa ruwaq hinam karqa.
Not this stranger.	Mana kay mana riqsisqa runachu.
It looks very, very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha, ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq.
I look forward to hearing from you soon!.	¡Suyachkani chaylla uyariyta!.
But I don't know what to do.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
This is the one for you.	Kaymi qampaq kaq.
He wanted to know where she was.	Maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
Anyway, you can't get out now.	Imayna kaptinpas kunanqa manam lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
We did this or we did that.	Kayta ruwarqayku icha chayta ruwarqayku.
And so you do, man.	Hinaspa chaynatam ruwanki, runa.
I can’t be alone either.	Ñuqapas manam sapallay kayta atiymanchu.
I thought maybe there was more to you.	Yuyarqanim ichapas aswan achka qampaq kanman nispa.
I’m not really worried.	Manam chiqaptachu llakikuni.
Wish I could remember that!.	¡Munayman karqan chayta yuyariyta!.
He realized he wanted to.	Payqa repararqanmi munasqanmanta.
Otherwise, everything is fine.	Mana chayqa, tukuy imapas allinmi.
Maybe you can do something about him.	Ichapas paymanta imatapas ruwawaq.
You are such a wonderful person.	Chayna sumaq runam kanki.
He didn’t disagree.	Payqa manan mana acuerdopichu karqan.
It’s unfortunate here.	Kaypiqa llakikuypaqmi.
You said as well as he could.	Allinta atisqanman hina nirqanki.
Again, it makes no sense.	Yapamanta, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
You know nothing about it at all.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachankichu ni imapipas.
It’s obviously very important.	Sut’inmi ancha importante.
That it is good.	Allin kasqanmanta.
Say that it is the case.	Chayna kasqanmanta niy.
You cannot undo the error.	Mana pantasqa llamk'ayta kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
There’s really nothing wrong with that.	Chiqamanta mana ima mana allinchu chaypiqa.
No one had been there yet.	Manaraqmi pipas chaypiqa karqachu.
Maybe he was too tired.	Ichapas payqa llumpayta sayk’usqa karqa.
The result was not a good one.	Chay ruwasqanqa manam allinchu karqa.
That’s where he likes it.	Chaypin payqa gustan.
We have to do what we have to do.	Imatachus ruwananchik tiyan chayta ruwananchik tiyan.
By doing so.	Chaynata ruwaspa.
We just did it right away.	Chayllaraqmi ruwarqayku.
Innocent, innocent, innocent.	Mana huchayoq, mana huchayoq, mana huchayoq.
That's his real name.	Chayqa chiqap sutinmi.
Everyone disagreed.	Lliwmi mana acuerdopichu karqaku.
It was probably for him.	Yaqapaschá paypaq karqan.
It doesn’t have to be right or wrong.	Manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kanan.
No, this was it.	Manan, kaymi karqan.
That doesn’t mean you can disagree with anyone.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu piwanpas mana acuerdopi kayta atisqaykita.
Yeah, it’s ridiculously good.	Arí, asikunapaq hina allinmi.
If anyone here has no idea, it’s me.	Kaypi pipas mana yuyayniyuq kaptinqa, ñuqam kani.
He made the walk out here.	Paymi kay hawapi puriyta ruwarqa.
It’s just not that good for me.	Chaylla mana chayna allinchu ñuqapaq.
He just told me it was an outdoor party.	Chayllaraqmi niwarqa hawapi fiestata nispa.
That doesn’t sound right.	Chayqa mana allinchu uyarikun.
I certainly won’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana ruwasaqchu.
Perhaps he can do that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa atinman.
Yes, he was hungry.	Arí, yarqaymanta kasqa.
Or, then again, maybe not.	Utaq, chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas mana.
For some reason he can no longer play.	Imaraykupas manañam pukllayta atinchu.
After that, things get more complicated.	Chay qhepamanmi aswan sasachakuypi tarikun.
And thankfully he walked out.	Hinaspa gracias nispa lluqsirqa.
I know these things well.	Chaykunataqa allintam yachani.
It’s okay, though.	Allinmi, ichaqa.
About an hour ago, actually.	Yaqa huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi, chiqaptaqa.
That’s not a .	Chayqa manan huk .
I'll be fine with you.	Allintam qamwan kasaq.
I knew it would be so good.	Yacharqanim chayna allin kananta.
But he always did it.	Ichaqa payqa sapa kutillanmi chaytaqa ruwaq.
Be thorough and quick.	Allinta hinaspa utqaylla kay.
Maybe he’s rich enough for her, but maybe .	Ichapas paypaq hina qhapaq kanman, ichaqa ichapas .
Sometimes more.	Wakin kuti aswan.
He probably knew that all along.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá tukuy tiempo yacharqan.
Something strange to me.	Imapas mana riqsisqa ñuqapaq.
She said it was worth it.	Payqa nirqanmi chay ruwasqanqa allinpaq kasqanmanta.
But it will always depend on the city.	Ichaqa sapa kutim llaqtamanta kanqa.
Tomorrow will be bad.	Paqarinmi mana allin kanqa.
I didn’t plan to see it there.	Manam chaypi qawayta yuyaykurqanichu.
It was a beautiful day anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas sumaq punchawmi karqa.
That is what the phrase says.	Chay rimayqa chaytam nin.
We did very, very well.	Ancha, ancha allintam ruwarqayku.
He seemed devastated.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa hinan karqan.
So he did it right away.	Chaymi payqa chayta ruwarqa.
So I was surprised that I would.	Chaymi admirakurqani chayta ruwasaq nispa.
More here, here, and here.	Astawan kaypi, kaypi, kaypi ima.
Do it next time.	Qatiqnin kutipi chayta ruway.
The patient is seriously ill.	Unqusqa sinchi unqusqa kachkan.
He thought he would be happy.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kusisqa kananta.
That's a long time to do this.	Chayqa unayñam kayta ruwanapaq.
I can be foolish.	Mana yuyayniyuq kayta atiyman.
I am well aware that it is so important.	Allintam yachani chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
He knew exactly where and when.	Payqa allintam yacharqa maypi hinaspa haykapi.
He couldn’t go himself.	Payqa manan pay kikin riyta atirqanchu.
I couldn't say how many.	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
Oh the good guys.	Aw chay allin runakuna.
Why wasn't he here.	Imaraykutaq mana kaypichu karqa.
He doesn't want to be there.	Payqa manam chaypi kayta munanchu.
I really went with that here.	Chiqaptam chaywan kaypi rirqani.
It was such a tragedy.	Chayna llakikuypaqmi karqa.
I want to hear from you.	Qanmanta uyariyta munani.
I’m not with you anymore.	Manañam qamwan kuskachu kachkani.
I never thought it would be a baby.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu wawa kanman nispa.
He does that here, he said.	Chaytaqa kaypi ruwan, nispa.
But he’s really really just there.	Ichaqa payqa cheqaqtapunin cheqaqtapuni chaylla kashan.
You’re not the one.	Manan qanmi kanki.
He was that cold.	Payqa chayna chiri karqa.
He was better than good.	Payqa aswan allinmi karqan allin kasqanmantaqa.
I thought twice about it.	Iskay kutitan yuyaykurqani.
You know, outside.	Yachanki, hawapi.
But you can’t take a chance.	Ichaqa manan huk oportunidadta hap’iyta atiwaqchu.
He certainly got it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta chaskirqan.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Manam ima niyta munanchu.
A few months and it could be summer.	Iskay kimsa killa hinaspa verano kanman.
I couldn’t understand it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan entiendeyta atirqanichu.
Here it says.	Kaypiqa ninmi.
I hope something comes of that.	Suyachkani chaymanta imapas hamunanta.
The best thing is the truth.	Aswan allinqa cheqaq kaqmi.
What is the job.	Imataq ruwana.
It will make listening faster.	Aswan utqaylla uyariyta ruwanqa.
Twenty people were arrested.	Iskay chunka runakunam hapisqa karqaku.
I can’t do anything right.	Manam imatapas allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I won’t have anywhere else to go.	Manam maymanpas rinaypaq kanqachu.
I heard that recently.	Chaytaqa chayllaraqmi uyarirqani.
I’d rather never do it again, ever.	Aswan allinmi kanman manaña hayk’aqpas ruwaymanchu, hayk’aqpas.
Say it three times.	Kimsa kutita niy.
It’s been a really good day.	Chiqamanta allin p’unchawmi karqan.
And since then.	Hinaspa chaymanta pacha.
You’re going to be quick.	Utqaylla rinki.
It wouldn’t be that difficult.	Manam chayna sasachu kanman.
You’ve done really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwarqanki.
Not always, of course, but always.	Mana sapa kutichu, chiqamanta, ichaqa sapa kuti.
They are not exactly important now.	Kunanqa manan allintachu importante kanku.
But he stopped needing it long ago.	Ichaqa unayñan chaytaqa manaña necesitarqanchu.
These are not.	Kaykunaqa manam.
And this continues.	Hinaspa kayqa hinallam kachkan.
But when, however, is uncertain.	Ichaqa hayk’aqmi ichaqa mana segurochu.
But the rest of the city wasn't too happy.	Ichaqa chay llaqtapi wakin runakunaqa manan ancha kusisqachu karqanku.
The first time around.	Ñawpaq kutipi.
This is the real problem.	Kaymi chiqap sasachakuy.
Of course, he will not go there alone.	Arí, manan sapallanchu chaymanqa rinqa.
You alone are to blame for what happened.	Qamllam huchayoq kanki imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
I have a smile.	Ñuqaqa kanmi.
But there was one.	Ichaqa hukninmi karqa.
Crazy, yeah.	Loco, arí.
He was probably around this time.	Payqa yaqapaschá kay tiempopi kasharqan.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Chaytaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atichwanchu.
This is all.	Kay tukuy.
I didn’t expect it to come.	Manam suyarqanichu hamunanta.
You’ll have to do better.	Aswan allin ruwanayki kanqa.
After that he can catch up.	Chay qhepamanmi hap’iyta atin.
And you’re a great guy.	Hinaspa hatun wayna kanki.
You knew something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yacharqanki.
It was funny, actually.	Asikunapaq hinam karqa, chiqaptaqa.
He wants to do this.	Payqa kayta ruwayta munan.
I wish it was a simpler task.	Munaymanmi aswan sasa ruway kayta.
The people were wonderful.	Chay runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi karqaku.
He doesn't know anything.	Mana imatapas mana yachanchu.
It doesn’t look like anything should happen.	Manan imapas kanan hinachu rikch’akun.
Everything had to be perfect.	Tukuy imapas allintam kanan karqa.
Now everyone knows everything.	Kunanqa lliwmi tukuy imatapas yachanku.
If you are, finish.	Sichus kanki chayqa, tukuy.
I didn’t know what it was.	Mana yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it seems fine.	Mana chayqa, allinmi rikchakun.
So do that, please.	Chaymi chayta ruway.
This last statement was wrong.	Kay qhipa rimayqa mana allinchu karqa.
I'm still not quite sure what that is all about.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu yachani imamanta chay kasqanmanta.
He is faster but quick.	Payqa aswan utqayllam ichaqa utqaylla.
Otherwise, it’s fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi.
In fact, they seemed worried.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa llakisqa hinam karqaku.
But he knew he would.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
He thought he probably would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta.
He is the second.	Payqa iskay kaqmi.
That seemed so crazy.	Chayqa ancha loco hinam rikchakurqa.
I'm not sure anymore.	Manañam segurochu kani.
I mean really big.	Chiqap hatun niyta munani.
Now he doesn't do it anymore.	Kunanqa manañam ruwanchu.
So here, .	Chaymi kaypi, .
Unlike other adults.	Mana wakin kuraq runakuna hinachu.
I didn’t want to know more either.	Ñuqapas manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
And then it will be fine.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa allinmi kanqa.
Both were very instructive.	Iskayninkum ancha yachachiq karqaku.
I want him here.	Payta kaypi munani.
For what he did.	Chay ruwasqanmanta.
They seem completely disappointed.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta hukmanyasqa hinam kanku.
Anything would do it.	Imapas ruwanman.
To be in the process.	Chay ruwaypi kananpaq.
To do with you.	Qanwan ruwanapaq.
Yes, of course he did.	Arí, sut’inmi chayta ruwarqan.
Maybe he was with someone.	Ichapas piwanpas kachkarqa.
That’s a good thing for you.	Chayqa allinmi qampaq.
Everything was quick and efficient.	Tukuy imapas utqaylla hinaspa allintam karqa.
You can’t, obviously.	Manan atiwaqchu, sut’inmi.
He's hungry and tired.	Payqa yarqasqa hinaspa sayk'usqa kachkan.
He wanted an exit.	Payqa huk lluqsiyta munarqan.
They're tired of you.	Paykunaqa qanmanta sayk'usqañan kashanku.
I really want to do all of that.	Tukuy chaykunataqa anchatam ruwayta munani.
I really wanted to know.	Cheqaqtapunin yachayta munarqani.
I thought you were him.	Paymi kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
There is no baseball.	Manam kanchu béisbol nisqa.
But they are still unhappy.	Ichaqa hinallam mana kusisqachu kachkanku.
You know everything is going to be okay.	Yachanki tukuy imapas allin kananta.
Now he looked at it.	Kunanqa qhawarisqa.
First, what’s wrong with it.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
That is why I disagree.	Chayraykum mana acuerdopichu kani.
He can't go anywhere without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam maymanpas riyta atinchu.
That’s why he was always there.	Chayraykum payqa sapa kutilla chaypi karqa.
That would be important.	Chayqa importante kanman.
It really doesn’t make any sense.	Cheqaqtapunin mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I am a stranger here.	Kaypiqa mana riqsisqa runam kani.
Now he knew that wasn't true.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi chay mana cheqaq kasqanmanta.
No one would want to hear it.	Manam pipas uyariyta munanmanchu karqa.
He wanted to keep watching.	Payqa hinallam qawayta munarqa.
Otherwise, it’s probably not.	Mana chayqa, manachá.
He made the door.	Paymi punkuta ruwarqa.
But that is not the case now.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
Soon she could be his.	Pisi tiempollamantan payqa paypaq kanman.
I doubt there will be much trouble.	Iskayrayani achka sasachakuy kananta.
He couldn’t walk anymore.	Manañam puriyta atirqachu.
Not sure what it is though.	Mana segurochu ima kasqanmanta ichaqa.
In fact, it’s better to do it right.	Chiqaptaqa, allinta ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
Repeat three times.	Kimsa kutita yapamanta ruway.
It was the worst part of everything.	Chayqa tukuy imamanta aswan mana allin kaqmi karqa.
This was kind of the younger one.	Kayqa huk laya sullk’a kaqmi karqan.
Something didn’t sit right.	Imapas mana allintachu tiyaq.
Three times as many.	Kimsa kutita aswan achka.
This needs to be done quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhaylla ruwana tiyan.
A process can create multiple windows.	Huk ruwayqa achka ventanata ruwayta atin.
It sounds easy, but it is a very difficult task.	Facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
I can't answer now.	Kunanqa manam kutichiyta atiymanchu.
It couldn’t end here.	Manam kaypiqa tukuyta atirqachu.
No it won’t be.	Manan manan kanqachu.
Or better yet, three months.	Utaq aswan allinqa, kimsa killa.
The speech spoke well.	Rimayqa allintam rimaq.
And then it’s up to you and me.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa qammanta ñuqamanta ima kanqa.
It was just like him.	Chayqa pay hinam karqa.
I really think you should.	Chiqamanta yuyani chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
And another, then another.	Hinaspa hukta, chaymanta hukta.
That’s what this whole thing is about.	Chaymantam kay tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
This is not an unreasonable action.	Kayqa manam mana yuyayniyuq ruwaychu.
I hope things work out for you.	Suyachkani imapas allin kananpaq qampaq.
He is the best in everything.	Paymi tukuy imapipas aswan allinqa.
He doesn’t disagree with me.	Payqa manan ñoqawanqa mana acuerdopichu kashan.
Yes you do.	Arí qamqa ruwanki.
I’m really, really, really sorry.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, chiqamanta llakikuni.
He does well there.	Chaypin allinta ruwan.
I hope it will be soon.	Suyachkani chaylla kananta.
So with us.	Chaymi ñuqaykuwan.
I’m a more current person.	Aswan kunan runa kani.
New world, new people.	Musuq pacha, musuq runakuna.
This cannot be helped.	Kaytaqa manam yanapayta atichwanchu.
However, this is not a good practice.	Ichaqa, kayqa manam allin ruwaychu.
I told her everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispaymi nirqani.
At this point, we’re taken care of.	Kaypiqa, allinta qhawarisqa kayku.
It’s not a meanness.	Manam millay kaychu.
I'll do something, please.	Imatapas ruwasaq, ama hina kaspa.
Better in the city than out here though.	Aswan allin llaqtapi aswan kaypi hawapi ichaqa.
It’s all about here, right now.	Tukuy imamanta kaypi, kunanpacha.
I can’t even afford it.	Manam nitaq atiymanchu.
There were two men there.	Chaypim iskay runakuna kasqa.
About two weeks ago, maybe three.	Yaqa iskay semana ñawpaqta, ichapas kimsa.
People are sad, angry, and frustrated.	Runakunaqa llakisqa, phiñasqa, hukmanyasqa ima kanku.
That was fine, after all.	Chayqa allinmi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
It has always been important.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ancha allin karqa.
If, if, if .	Sichus, sichus, sichus .
He wanted to leave now.	Payqa kunan ripuyta munarqa.
A ridiculous year.	Asikunapaq wata.
That’s why he was human.	Chayraykum runa kasqa.
He wanted to ask her something.	Payqa imatapas tapuyta munarqa.
One by one, the other.	Hukmanta huknin.
That doesn’t always work.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwan.
And that’s all there is to it here.	Hinaspa chaylla kaypi kachkan.
I didn’t think of those things.	Manam chaykunataqa yuyaykurqanichu.
I feel like I do.	Ñuqaqa hinam tarikuni.
You just didn’t say no very often.	Chaylla mana ancha sapa kutichu mana nirqanki.
Very bad for you.	Ancha mana allinmi qampaq.
But still, he was very happy with her.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas, payqa ancha kusisqam karqa paywan.
This time, together.	Kay kutipi, kuska.
Yeah, he’s really, really good.	Arí, payqa chiqap, chiqap allinmi.
Here’s the big one.	Kaypi hatun kaq.
Whatever this is you are doing.	Imapas kaytam ruwachkanki.
A really good guy.	Chiqap allin runa.
I do a lot here.	Kaypiqa anchatam ruwani.
What's with you.	Imataq qamwan kachkan.
But they were all terrified, he said.	Ichaqa llapallankum mancharisqa karqaku, nispa.
But that was all in the future.	Ichaqa chayllam hamuq tiempopi karqa.
It was so easy that way.	Chay hinaqa ancha facilmi karqan.
He was scared and drunk.	Payqa mancharisqa, machasqa ima kasqa.
The locals are the best.	Chay llaqtapi runakunaqa aswan allinmi.
And the city will have everything.	Hinaspa chay llaqtapiqa tukuy imapas kanqa.
I’m a big girl now.	Kunanqa hatun sipasmi kani.
Or not yet, anyway.	Utaq manaraq, imayna kaptinpas.
I mean, it has to be real, that’s all.	Niyta munani, chiqap kanan, chaylla.
If that’s not good enough.	Chay mana allinchu kanman chayqa.
A truly lonely man.	Chiqap sapallan runa.
He didn’t want to do it.	Mana ruwayta munarqanchu.
They know all about it.	Tukuy chayta yachanku.
He does it all the time.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwan.
This approach fails.	Kay ruwayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
This was him now.	Kayqa kunanqa paymi karqan.
He is not .	Payqa manan .
Okay, that was a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi karqa.
He seemed so sure.	Payqa ancha seguro hinam karqa.
Can't stop talking about you.	Mana qammanta rimayta saqiyta atinchu.
I never want to hear it.	Manam haykapipas uyariyta munanichu.
I'm afraid there may be more than that.	Manchakuni aswan achka kanman chaymanta.
Then again this morning.	Chaymanta yapamanta kunan paqarin.
It was a really long time.	Chiqap unayñam karqa.
Maybe like always.	Ichapas sapa kuti hina.
And now here we are.	Hinaspa kunanqa kaypi kachkaniku.
One never does.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
It was very cold.	Sinchi chiri karqan.
I really don’t know how.	Chiqamanta mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta.
You’ll do well there.	Chaypin allinta ruwanki.
That was easier for me.	Chayqa aswan facilmi karqani.
This is what humanity is.	Kaymi runa kayqa.
It came out a few years ago.	Iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi lluqsirqa.
Now he probably knows.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá yachan.
That’s right, maybe not.	Chayqa allinmi, manapaschá.
I wonder how he knew.	Tapukuni imaynatataq yacharqa.
I am truly a child.	Cheqaqtapunin wawa kani.
I wonder where he went.	Mayman risqanmanta tapukuni.
It’s there all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chaypi kashan.
It was certainly the most wonderful time.	Chiqamanta aswan sumaq pacha karqa.
Only you can do that.	Qamllam chayta ruwawaq.
No, things are fine.	Manan, imapas allinmi.
I don’t want to play it.	Manam munanichu chayta tocayta.
Maybe there was never anything there.	Ichapas chaypiqa mana haykapipas imapas karqachu.
Still, he wasn't there.	Chayna kaptinpas manam chaypichu karqa.
They are not what they are now.	Paykunaqa manan kunan hinachu kanku.
I thought he had a bad attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Every day is like a year.	Sapa punchawmi huk wata hina.
No one seems concerned.	Manas pipas llakisqa hinachu.
It sounds great.	Hatunmi uyarikun.
He has done this many times.	Payqa askha kutitan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I can't see anything outside now.	Kunanqa manam hawapi imatapas rikunichu.
It’s just you and me here.	Kaypiqa qamwan ñuqallam kachkaniku.
He wasn’t really there.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kasharqan.
That may be too much for you.	Chay ruwayqa yaqapaschá qanpaq nishuta.
They were all crazy.	Llapallankum loco karqaku.
But he could tell she was disappointed.	Ichaqa repararqanmi hukmanyasqa kashasqanmanta.
So, here's another thing for you to do.	Chaymi, kaypi huk ruway qampaq kachkan.
It better be important.	Aswan allinmi kanman importante kanman.
And we’re something else than that.	Hinaspa huk imapas kayku chaymantaqa.
Most of the time you do.	Yaqa llapanpim chayta ruwanki.
Everything should be better and better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allin hinaspa aswan allin kanan.
I’m afraid to be alone here.	Kaypi sapallay kayta manchakuni.
Yes it does everything.	Arí tukuyta ruwan.
Instead, I doubt it.	Aswanpas iskayrayani.
Shouldn’t you do that.	Manachu chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Maybe one day it will be that good.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna allin kanman.
It’s me you want to know.	Ñuqam kani yachayta munanki.
It was a great day.	Chayqa hatun punchawmi karqa.
Something was here.	Imapas kaypi karqa.
Do whatever you want with him.	Paywan ima munasqaykita ruway.
Surely, things could have been better.	Chiqamanta, imapas allin kanman karqa.
This can often be inappropriate.	Kayqa achka kutipi mana allinchu kanman.
Very fast indeed.	Ancha utqaylla chiqap.
Be a teacher.	Huk yachachiq kay.
I can’t say yet.	Manaraqmi niyta atiymanchu.
It’s a very difficult thing to do, this.	Ancha sasa ruwaymi, kayta.
There is nothing better.	Manam imapas aswan allinqa kanchu.
That sounds like you.	Chayqa qam hinam uyarikun.
Unfortunately, that's the only really good thing about it.	Llakikuypaqmi, chaylla chiqap allinqa chaymanta.
Now this does not exist.	Kunanqa kayqa manam kanchu.
I mean for sure.	Seguro niyta munani.
Now he will do that.	Kunanqa chaytan ruwanqa.
John is right about it.	Juanqa allintam rimachkan.
Don't ever do it.	Ama hayk'aqpas ruwaychu.
They were a lot like you.	Paykunaqa anchatan qan hina karqanku.
He said he wanted to.	Payqa munani nispas nisqa.
Alone, always alone.	Sapallan, sapa kuti sapallan.
He would soon do so.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan chayta ruwanman karqan.
We always pretended you were with us.	Sapa kutim ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita hina ruwaq kayku.
This was something.	Kayqa imapas karqa.
So it doesn’t work.	Chaymi mana allinta ruwan.
He's doing well now.	Payqa kunanqa allintam kachkan.
And so it started to slip out.	Hinaspa chaymi lluqsiyta qallaykurqa.
It's safer.	Aswan segurom.
But I’m not sure how I’m going to do that.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani imaynatas chayta ruwasaq chayta.
He was meant to be somewhere.	Payqa maypipas kananpaqmi karqa.
He didn’t seem disappointed.	Payqa manan hukmanyasqa hinachu karqan.
Maybe this was for him.	Ichapas kayqa paypaq karqa.
It doesn’t mean that.	Manan chayta niyta munanchu.
But this is still the case.	Ichaqa kayqa hinallam kachkan.
Which was to say, angry.	Imataq niyta karqa, phiñasqa.
Doing that wouldn’t be me.	Chayta ruwayqa mana ñuqachu kayman.
He certainly doesn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana.
And pretend it doesn’t matter.	Hinaspa mana importante kananpaq hina ruway.
But he is afraid of it.	Ichaqa manchakunmi chayta.
In fact, they are.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa kanku.
Monday is bad for me.	Lunes punchawqa mana allinmi ñuqapaq.
You know a lot of things.	Achkatam yachanki.
Again, as before.	Yapamanta, ñawpaq hina.
He’s a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq wayna.
But now it was, like last night.	Ichaqa kunanmi chayna karqa, qayna tuta hina.
He didn't seem surprised.	Payqa manam admirasqa hinachu karqa.
It's not always that important to be hungry, really.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna importante yarqaymanta kayqa, chiqaptaqa.
He didn't know who the other two were.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pikuna wakin iskay kasqankuta.
I want to do more and more.	Astawan astawan ruwayta munani.
But then it kept happening.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa hinallam pasarqa.
Tomorrow would be the last.	Paqarinmi kanman karqan qhepa kaq.
He was hurt and angry.	Payqa k’irisqa, phiñasqa ima kasharqan.
In fact, it’s rather surprising.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan admirakuypaqmi.
That won’t happen now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa kanqachu.
He didn’t really do anything.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas ruwarqan.
No, of course not.	Manan, sut’inmi mana.
I thought he might be alone.	Yuyarqanim sapallan kanman nispa.
This can be a very big alternative though.	Kayqa ancha hatun huk ruwaymi kanman ichaqa.
Wrong he might have been wrong.	Pantasqa payqa yaqapaschá pantasqa kanman karqan.
It’s been a year.	Huk watañam.
They are often the case.	Sapa kutim chayna kanku.
Tom took a good look at him.	Tomqa allintan payta qhawarirqan.
I think it was the third time.	Yuyaykuni kimsa kaq kuti kasqanmanta.
He was a married man.	Payqa casarasqa runam karqa.
That really does.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwan.
In fact, he should have been there earlier.	Chiqaptaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi kanan karqa.
They are all out there, everywhere.	Llapallankum hawapi kachkanku, maypipas.
He couldn't hear her now.	Payqa manan kunanqa uyariyta atinmanchu karqan.
Actually two of him now.	Chiqaptaqa iskay paymanta kunan.
Not bad, actually.	Mana mana allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
He loves to ride in the car.	Carropi puriyta anchata munan.
But no, no, that wouldn’t be true.	Ichaqa manan, manan, chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman.
He doesn’t really know what to do though.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yachan ima ruwananta ichaqa.
We're not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kayku chayna kasqanmanta.
So thank you very much.	Chaymi anchata gracias.
I think about it a lot.	Yuyaykuni anchata.
This did not go well.	Kayqa manam allintachu rirqa.
This is the worst that can happen.	Kaymi aswan mana allinqa kanman.
Yes, he could not sleep that night.	Arí, chay tutaqa manam puñuyta atirqachu.
There was all the action.	Chaypim tukuy ruwayqa karqa.
It really happened so fast.	Chiqaptam chayna utqaylla pasarqa.
It is a daily learning process.	Sapa punchaw yachay ruwaymi.
I need it every day.	Sapa punchawmi necesitasaq.
This is a very big deal.	Ancha hatunmi kayqa.
You go to the school.	Yachay wasiman rinki.
Where there is no child.	Maypichus mana wawa kanchu.
There were about twenty of them.	Paykunaqa yaqa iskay chunka hinam karqaku.
I think he’s the best player in the world.	Yuyaykuni payqa kay pachapi aswan allin pukllaqmi.
He said he didn't know much about him.	Payqa nirqam paymanta mana anchata yachasqayta.
And be smart about it.	Chaymanta yachaysapa kay.
And so he came to live with me.	Hinaspa chaynatam payqa hamurqa ñuqawan yachananpaq.
He was facing it.	Payqa chayman qhawarisqa kasharqan.
In fact, he may be doing something wrong.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá payqa mana allintachu ruwashan.
I’m so glad about that.	Anchatam kusikuni chaymanta.
Just never thought of it before.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu ñawpaqtaqa.
He had no idea whatsoever.	Mana ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
Beautiful, she thinks, very beautiful to him.	Sumaqmi, nispas yuyaykun, ancha sumaqmi paypaq.
Alternatively, you can do your own thing.	Mana chayqa, qampaq ruwasqaykita ruwawaq.
At first I thought this was the problem.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaymi sasachakuy kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani.
Obviously I haven’t thought through this properly.	Sut’inmi mana allintachu kaypiqa yuyaykurqani.
Yes, that was his name.	Arí, chay sutinmi karqa.
I'm tired of being good all the time.	Tukuy tiempo allin kasqaymanta sayk'usqa kashani.
Did it a few times.	Iskay kimsa kutita ruwarqa.
I wonder if you can just do it.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus chaylla atiwaqchu.
Now, this next one.	Kunanqa, kay qatiqnin.
Maybe me more than you.	Ichapas ñuqa aswan qammanta.
Today would be the special day.	Kunan punchawmi kanman chay punchaw ancha allin.
The innocent man.	Mana huchayoq runa.
But the results were not immediate.	Ichaqa manan usqhayllachu chay ruwasqanqa karqan.
There will be more than one activity.	Aswan huk ruwaymi kanqa.
Not happy at all.	Mana kusisqachu ni imapipas.
The day is a good one.	Chay punchawqa allinmi.
Maybe it’s everything.	Ichapas tukuy imapas kanman.
Can you please help.	¿Atiwaqchu ama hina kaspa yanapayta.
He was bigger, now.	Payqa aswan hatunmi kasqa, kunanqa.
He gave me everything.	Paymi tukuy imata quwarqa.
I wasn't there.	Ñoqaqa manam chaypichu karqa.
And all night long.	Hinaspa tukuy tuta.
I was like I could be me.	Ñuqaqa chayna karqani ñuqa kayta atiyman.
Maybe now he can.	Ichapas kunanqa atinman.
You don’t want to say the wrong thing.	Manam munankichu mana allin rimayta.
But pretty much everything was easy.	Ichaqa yaqa tukuy imapas facilmi karqa.
Bad act on my part.	Mana allin ruway ñuqamanta.
I am a new person.	Ñuqaqa huk musuq runam kani.
I don’t know what to say there.	Mana yachanichu chaypi imata niyta.
In fact, every season.	Chiqaptaqa, sapa pacha.
Every bad time.	Sapa millay pacha.
I’m afraid to speak.	Rimayta manchakuni.
He wasn’t really hungry.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yarqasqa kasharqan.
It was a very, very beautiful day.	Ancha, ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.
They were furious.	Paykunaqa sinchita phiñasqa karqanku.
I can't stand to be here.	Manam aguantayta atinichu kaypi kanaypaq.
But this was ridiculous.	Ichaqa kayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
He probably never did.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
In most cases, he failed.	Yaqa llapanpim mana atirqachu.
Actually do it.	Chiqamanta ruway.
That’s everyone doing it.	Chayqa llapa ruwaq runam.
I could never tell anyone.	Manam haykapipas pimanpas willayta atirqanichu.
Unfortunately he couldn’t.	Llakikuypaqmi mana atirqachu.
Repeat step two.	Iskay kaq ruwayta yapamanta ruway.
This is simple, that's all.	Kayqa sasam, chayllam.
The way he wanted it.	Imaynatachus munarqa.
Unlike anyone at all.	Mana pimanpas hinachu ni imapipas.
He’d hurt her.	Payqa payta k’irisqa.
This, however, is not the point here.	Kaymi ichaqa mana kaypichu yuyaykushan.
He didn’t think he could walk alone.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu sapallan puriyta atinman karqan.
He knew it would be easy.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruwayqa facil kananta.
Great week.	Hatun semana.
The night is very cold.	Tutaqa ancha chiri.
That’s you and all yours.	Chayqa qanmi hinaspa llapan qanpa kaq.
But now it will never happen.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
You can’t let him win.	Manan atiwaqchu atipananta.
But nothing is right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu.
No one could help here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas yanapayta atirqachu.
We are beautiful people.	Sumaq runam kanchik.
It's a better day.	Aswan allin punchawmi.
But a	Ichaqa huk .
Now I am very sad.	Kunanqa ñuqa ancha llakisqa.
Much colder than this.	Ancha aswan chiri kaymantaqa.
I know this is stupid.	Yachanim kayqa sonso kasqanmanta.
There was some quick work to be done.	Chaypin wakin usqhaylla ruwana karqan.
The people are great.	Runakunaqa hatunmi kanku.
So, we are sure of that.	Chaymi, chaymantaqa seguro kayku.
I don't need to be here to do this.	Manam necesitasaqchu kaypi kayta ruwanaypaq.
I’ve been like this all along.	Tukuy tiempon kay hina karqani.
This then is pretty much where it is now.	Kay chaymantaqa yaqa maypichus kunan kachkan chaypi kachkan.
That’s a wonderful thing, and we’re proud of it.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi, chaymi orgulloso kayku.
No one wants to work for him.	Manan pipas paypaq llank’ayta munanchu.
There, he said.	Chaypi, nispa.
A foolish night.	Huk mana yuyayniyuq tuta.
Second, everyone wants to go.	Iskay kaq, llapallankum riyta munanku.
Not someone who walks with me.	Mana ñuqawan puriq runachu.
I couldn’t find it.	Manam tariyta atirqanichu.
He said he didn't think so.	Payqa nirqam mana chaynatachu piensasqanmanta.
No one knows where he is.	Manas pipas yachanchu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I certainly know better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allinta yachani.
He will do whatever he can to make it happen.	Chay hina kananpaqmi atisqanman hina ruwanqa.
They weren’t exactly stupid.	Paykunaqa manan allintachu sonso karqanku.
I'm always alone, really alone.	Sapa kutim sapallay kani, chiqaptapuni sapallay.
Yes, as always.	Arí, sapa kuti hina.
Not the easiest, but the simplest thing.	Mana aswan facilchu, aswanpas aswan facil kaqmi.
Do this several times a week.	Semanapi askha kutita chayta ruway.
I did that today.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwarqani.
He is the most famous person.	Aswan riqsisqa runam.
Are you there.	Chaypichu kanki.
It made no sense why he was here.	Manam imapaqpas allinchu karqa imanasqa kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
He couldn't look at her.	Manam payta qawayta atirqachu.
He’s scared, unsure.	Payqa mancharisqa, mana segurochu.
It must continue to be.	Hinallam kanan.
No, it’s the latter.	Manan, chayqa qhepa kaqmi.
He’s better with me.	Payqa aswan allinmi ñuqawan.
Great, not bad at all.	Hatun, mana mana allinchu ni imapipas.
I sort of agree with that.	Chaywanmi huk laya acuerdopi kani.
He is a very serious and proud man.	Payqa ancha serio hinaspa orgulloso runam.
We are proud of that.	Chaywanmi orgulloso kayku.
It kind of happened very, very quickly.	Chayqa huk laya ancha, ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
So, a lot can go wrong there.	Chaymi, chaypiqa achka mana allinchu kanman.
They are very good people.	Ancha allin runakunam kanku.
He is not alone there.	Chaypiqa manam sapallanchu kachkan.
He said he felt great.	Paymi nirqa hatun sientekusqanmanta.
I always wanted to work with him.	Sapa kutim paywan llamkayta munarqani.
One of them is better.	Hukninmi aswan allin.
We did some interesting things.	Wakin sumaq ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
That’s the real thing.	Chayqa chiqap ruwaymi.
However, this would not be the safest.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan segurochu kanman.
This can be unsafe.	Kayqa mana segurochu kanman.
Yes, it is not good today.	Arí, kunan tiempopiqa manan allinchu.
If so, please tell me.	Chayna kaptinqa ama hina kaspa niy.
Everyone has many opinions on this.	Sapa runam kaymanta achka yuyayniyuq.

But, again there is more.	Ichaqa, yapamanta aswan achka kan.
Tell me everything.	Tukuy imata willay.
He would have done well now.	Kunanqa allintam ruwanman karqa.
It may take a few tries to get it right.	Ichapas iskay kimsa kutita ruwana allinta ruwanapaq.
That’s not at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas.
They are not action.	Paykunaqa manan ruwaychu kanku.
I never knew who did it.	Mana hayk’aqpas yacharqanichu pikuna ruwasqanmanta.
The best thing you can do is.	Aswan allinqa chayta ruwanaykipaq.
So that will be next week.	Chaymi chayqa kanqa hamuq semanapi.
That makes me happier.	Chaywanmi aswan kusisqa kachkani.
He’s not feeling well.	Payqa mana allinchu kashan.
That’s a good thing, yeah.	Chayqa allinmi, arí.
He felt like two people.	Iskay runa hinam tarikurqa.
It’s not like anything else.	Manam imapas hinachu.
It can get to that point.	Chayman chayayta atin.
I've never been able to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
No one was out of place.	Manam pipas mana maypipas karqachu.
There is no need to act quickly.	Chayllam imatapas ruwana.
You said you almost did.	Yaqa ruwasqaykita nirqanki.
I want him to do that right.	Chayta allinta ruwananta munani.
I hear it again.	Yapamanta uyarini.
I’ve had this for a long time.	Unayñan kayta hap’ini.
Anyone could have been.	Pipas chayna kanman karqa.
Now do it quickly.	Kunanqa usqhaylla ruway.
First he published the book.	Ñawpaqtaqa chay librota hurqurqa.
Yes, but that was the minimum.	Arí, ichaqa chaymi aswan pisi karqan.
A true man, he was well known.	Chiqap runa, allin riqsisqa karqa.
He would like that.	Payqa chaytam munanman.
Now everything was clear.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas sut’inmi karqan.
You always knew what you wanted.	Sapa kutim yacharqanki ima munasqaykita.
I love playing with him.	Paywan pukllayta anchata munani.
But it’s not funny.	Ichaqa manan asikunapaq hinachu.
The night felt cold.	Tutaqa chiri hinam tarikurqa.
He never knows that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yachanchu.
Eventually it will be uncertain.	Qhepamanmi mana segurochu kanqa.
But one of them did it right away.	Ichaqa hukninmi chaylla ruwarqa.
And this is, indeed, what it looks like.	Hinaspa kaymi, chiqaptapuni, imayna kasqanmanta.
He didn’t really know.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yacharqan.
If so, how does the	Chayna kaptinqa, ¿imaynatataq .
He doesn’t know how to stop it.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna hark’ayta.
I want to fix everything.	Tukuy imata allichayta munani.
So be happy.	Chaymi kusisqa kay.
He looks angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam rikchakun.
He was a pretty nice guy.	Payqa sumaq sumaq wayna kasqa.
He thinks he’s on to something.	Payqa imapipas kashasqanmantan yuyaykun.
If you do, everyone is happy.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, llapa runan kusisqa kashanku.
They were anonymous.	Paykunaqa mana sutiyuq karqaku.
But it’s faster.	Ichaqa aswan utqaylla.
He will probably never do it again.	Yaqapaschá manaña hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
This is a well-known practice.	Kayqa allin riqsisqa ruwaymi.
There will be something else.	Huk imapas kanqa.
That was yesterday, or the day before, or today.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa, utaq ñawpaq punchawmi karqa, utaq kunan punchawmi karqa.
I want to make money.	Qullqita tariyta munani.
Tough chance, for sure.	Sinchi chansa, seguro.
Seriously, you look great.	Serio, ancha sumaqmi rikchakunki.
The last step is to .	Qhipa kaq ruwayqa .
I wish it wasn't that big of a deal.	Munaymanmi mana chayna hatun kananpaq.
Which would have been absurd.	Imataq mana yuyayniyuq kanman karqa.
And, the same amount of money.	Hinaspa, chay kikin qullqita.
You can’t do that again.	Manan chaytaqa yapamanta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But it wasn’t like him.	Ichaqa manan pay hinachu karqan.
But we certainly did.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqayku.
So go for it.	Chaymi riy.
I did it once a week.	Semanapi huk kutitam chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
yes, he did it.	arí, chaytam ruwarqa.
Someone has to be.	Pipas kanan.
It was last week.	Qayna semanan karqan.
After the first week, I was the last person.	Ñawpaq semana qhepamanmi qhepa kaq runa karqani.
But please go now.	Ichaqa ama hina kaspa kunan riy.
It was good to be a little proud.	Allinmi karqan huk chhikanta orgulloso kayqa.

They were out the whole time.	Paykunaqa tukuy tiempon hawapi karqanku.
If not, do as you do.	Mana chayqa, qan hina ruway.
It would seem to be the case here.	Kaypiqa chayna kanman hinam kanman.
The first man from the city.	Llaqtamanta ñawpaq kaq runa.
You did well for a week.	Huk semanan allinta ruwarqanki.
Unfortunately this is not always the case.	Llakikuypaqmi mana sapa kutichu chayna kan.
He didn’t know who that might be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pichus chay kanman chayta.
Or at home.	Utaq wasipi.
I was tired, hungry and more or less scared.	Sayk’usqa, yarqasqa, aswan pisi mancharisqa ima karqani.

This was a month ago.	Kayqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
He was here with her.	Payqa kaypi paywan kasqa.

He certainly knew better than I did.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ñoqamanta aswan allinta yacharqan.
It was safer out in the open.	Aswan seguro karqan hawapi hawapi.
Probably something he should have done.	Yaqapaschá imatachus ruwanan karqan.
You can’t beat him.	Manan paytaqa atipayta atiwaqchu.
You are, very good.	Qamqa kanki, ancha allinmi.
I am now a married man!.	¡Kunanqa casarasqa runam kani!.
He was there last year.	Qayna wata chaypi karqa.
Unfortunately, the rest of the world wasn't so sure.	Llakikuypaqmi, kay pachapi wakin runakunaqa mana ancha segurochu karqaku.
I’ll be alone.	Sapallanmi kasaq.
All summer months.	Tukuy chiri killa.
And one day it happened.	Hinaspa huk punchaw chayna pasarqa.
I didn’t want him to be sad.	Manam munarqanichu llakisqa kananta.
So, that’s probably the case.	Chaymi, chayna kanman.
I hear this over and over again.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim sapa kutilla uyarini.
Very much a person.	Anchata huk runa.
That’s right, good boy.	Chayqa, allin wayna.
They know a lot.	Paykunaqa achkatam yachanku.
I think they’re nice people.	Yuyaykuni sumaq runakuna kasqankuta.
But this wasn’t exactly true.	Ichaqa manan allintachu kayqa cheqaq karqan.
She couldn’t stand him.	Payqa manan paytaqa aguantayta atirqanchu.
I really don't want that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa munanichu.
Surprisingly, it wasn't the hardest.	Admirakuypaqmi, manam aswan sasachu karqa.
You won't be so happy about it.	Manam chayna kusisqachu kanki chaymantaqa.
If you think it through, it will work out.	Allinta yuyaykunki chayqa, allintan kanqa.
Like, really lonely.	Imayna, chiqap sapallan.
I am certainly the least.	Ñoqaqa cheqaqtapunin aswan pisi.
Said it was very important.	Nirqa ancha importante kasqanmanta.
You’re a good guy.	Allin wayna kanki.
Something was wrong, he was nowhere to be found.	Imapas mana allinchu kasqa, mana maypipas kasqa.
It was a wonderful day.	Chayqa ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.
That’s right, whatever.	Chayqa allinmi, imapas.
He was worried about it.	Payqa chaymanta llakisqa kachkarqa.
Unnamed black.	Mana sutiyuq yana.
He’s not a good guy.	Manam allin runachu.
If it goes on like this.	Sichus hina rin.
I know something is wrong now.	Yachanim kunan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe it’s mine.	Ichapas ñuqapa kanman.
Not to be popular.	Mana ancha riqsisqa kananpaqchu.
This sounds worse.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi uyarikun.
John did much better.	Juanqa aswan allintan ruwarqan.
That’s all very well.	Chayqa tukuy ancha allinmi.
If so, it is not so easy.	Chayna kaptinqa manam chayna facilchu.
But they are still the same person.	Ichaqa chay runa hinallam kachkanku.
It’s actually that wonderful thing.	Chiqaptaqa chay sumaq ruwaymi.
I always said that, that's what I thought.	Sapa kutim chaynata nirqani, chaynatam piensarqani.
Very very bad.	Ancha ancha mana allin.
He should have done that yesterday.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi ruwanan karqa.
Not this, at least.	Mana kaychu, aswanpas.
Again, it was a child.	Yapamanta, wawa kasqa.
That’s for you and me.	Chayqa qampaq, ñuqapaq ima.
Not too sure where it will go though.	Mana ancha segurochu mayman rinqa ichaqa.
What do you plan to do about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwayta yuyaykunki?.
This is amazing for sure.	Kayqa admirakuypaqmi seguro.
It has never been this good anywhere.	Manam haykapipas kay hina allinqa karqachu maypipas.
No one has to do anything for you.	Manan pipas qanpaq imatapas ruwananchu.
It’s out there now.	Kunanqa hawapi kachkan.
This approach is often inappropriate.	Chay ruwayqa sapa kutim mana allinchu.
And, the day after that.	Hinaspa, chaymanta qhepa p’unchay.
He would have been arrested soon.	Payqa usqhayllan hap’isqa kanman karqan.
Some more some less.	Wakin aswan wakin pisi.
This was pretty funny.	Kayqa ancha asikunapaq hinam karqa.
He's in the hospital right now.	Payqa kunan hospitalpi kachkan.
Now, you have .	Kunanqa, qanmi .
He’s the one who did it.	Paymi chayta ruwarqan.
So, big difference.	Chaymi, hatun chikan kay.
Nothing could have been easier.	Manan imapas aswan facilchu kanman karqan.

There is a man.	Runaqa kanmi.

A beautiful house.	Huk sumaq wasi.
And it all seems so easy.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas ancha facilmi rikchakun.
I want to do it after that.	Chay qhepamanmi ruwayta munani.
He’ll go again.	Yapamanta rinqa.
This means the first sentence.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq rimayta niyta munan.
I am here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi kachkani.
They were all difficult.	Llapallankum sasa karqa.
What’s more interesting than that?.	¿Imataq chaymanta aswan sumaq?.
No one ever does this.	Manam pipas haykapipas kaytaqa ruwanchu.
He couldn't talk to anyone.	Payqa manam piwanpas rimayta atirqachu.
I need speed.	Utqaylla kaytam necesitasaq.
A man walked out, and that was all.	Huk runa puriq lluqsirqa, chayllam karqa.
No, you certainly don’t want to.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin mana munankichu.
He's right here.	Payqa allintam kaypi kachkan.
Said he needed someone like me to talk to.	Nirqa ñuqa hina piwanpas rimananpaq necesitasqanmanta.
This puts him in a bad position.	Chaywanmi mana allin ruwaypi tarikun.
I want everything to happen right now.	Munani kunanpacha tukuy imapas pasananta.
But he refused to take it.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu chayta hap’iyta.
That seemed kind of tough.	Chayqa rikchakurqa huk laya sinchi.
Then it all depends.	Chaymantam tukuy imamanta kanqa.
I built the car every day, morning, and night.	Sapa punchawmi, tutamanta, tutamanta chay carrota ruwaq kani.
He may not have been able to finish the job.	Manapaschá chay llamkayta tukuyta atirqachu.

But he did not act accordingly.	Ichaqa manan chayman hinachu imatapas ruwarqan.
So, it's a.	Chaymi, huk.
I didn’t expect people to be here.	Manam suyarqanichu runakuna kaypi kananta.
He’s really in the real world.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin cheqaq pachapi kashan.
First of all , the	Ñawpaqtaqa .
I don’t want to be this.	Manam munanichu kayta.
Yes, he just quit.	Arí, chayllaraqmi saqirqa.

It looks bad now.	Kunanqa mana allinmi rikchakun.
He’s the one who knows! 	¡Payqa yachanmi!
I thought it was mine.	Yuyarqanim ñuqapa.
I just want to say something.	Chayllaraqmi imatapas niyta munani.
If you did, that’s nice.	Chayta ruwarqanki chayqa, sumaqmi.
Obviously, you’re going to get hurt.	Sut’inmi, k’irisqa kanki.
I couldn’t ignore him.	Manam paytaqa mana uyariyta atirqanichu.
I mean every day.	Sapa punchawmi niyta munani.
The man could not reach him.	Chay runaqa manam chayayta atirqachu.
They were indeed married.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa casarasqa karqanku.
Here’s what you have to do.	Kaypi ruwanayki kachkan.
Cold and angry.	Chiri hinaspa phiñasqa.
He was a young man.	Payqa wayna runam karqa.
That will be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
Let me know if you do.	Willaway sichus ruwanki chayqa.
He's really good at baseball.	Payqa chiqaptam allin béisbol nisqapi.
He tried to stop her, but couldn’t.	Payqa hark’ayta munarqan, ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
They were the best, but not the best.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi karqanku, ichaqa manan aswan allinchu karqanku.
I’m afraid it might happen again.	Manchakuni hukmanta chayna kanman nispa.
So he wanted to go.	Chayraykum riyta munarqa.
Tell us where you are.	Maypi kasqaykita willay.
I wasn’t quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yacharqani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.

But there is a man there.	Ichaqa chaypiqa huk runam kachkan.
I would do anything for you, you know.	Imatapas qanpaq ruwayman karqan, chaytan yachanki.
Everything happens for a reason.	Tukuy imapas imaraykupas kanmi.
I wasn’t ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manan listochu karqani.
Not this good.	Mana kay allinchu.
That's why this is so hard for me.	Chayraykum kayqa ancha sasa ñuqapaq.
It is usually the worst thing in the world.	Yaqa llapanpim kay pachapi aswan mana allin kaq.
He is sad and depressed.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkan.
A happier time.	Aswan kusisqa pacha.
So he's scared right now.	Chaymi kunanpacha mancharisqa kachkan.

Be someone you want.	Pipas munasqayki kay.
I wonder if this.	Tapukuni sichus kay.
He knew the truth.	Payqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kaqta.
These, however, are extremely easy to do.	Chaykunataqa ichaqa sinchi facil ruwaymi.
I’d rather be here than there.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaypi kay, chaypi kaymantaqa.
It was all about the situation.	Tukuy imapas imayna kasqanmantam karqa.

Once or twice, this is not a bad thing.	Huk kuti iskay kuti, kayqa manam mana allinchu.

That’s a bad thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa mana allinmi.
He seems to be very intelligent.	Payqa ancha yuyayniyuq hinam kachkan.
Not bad, if he said so himself.	Mana mana allinchu, sichus pay kikin chayta nirqan chayqa.
I didn't think it would be that easy.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna facil kananta.
I can't work anymore.	Manañam llamkayta atiymanchu.
Okay, you're not there.	Allinmi, manam chaypichu kanki.
I wish he could do it today.	Allinmi kanman kunan punchaw ruwayta atinman chayqa.
So this is what it means.	Chaymi kayqa niyta munan.
Maybe he was being unreasonable.	Ichapas mana yuyayniyuq kachkarqa.
But he doesn’t do that anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Yes, he didn’t do it right.	Arí, payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
Nothing new out there.	Mana imapas musuq chay hawapi.
There is no point in doing otherwise.	Manam imapaqpas valenchu ​​huk hina ruwayqa.

But, it was the right thing to do.	Ichaqa, allin ruwaymi karqan.
I couldn’t seem to get anything right.	Manapaschá imatapas allinta tariyta atirqanichu.
Too many things can go wrong.	Llumpay achka imapas mana allinchu kanman.

One person was seriously injured.	Huk runam sinchita k’irisqa karqan.
Nothing is ever a big deal.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas hatun ruwaychu.

Today was a wonderful day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.
No one knew this was coming.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu kay hamunanta.
All of them failed.	Llapallankum mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Hopefully this is something you really want.	Munaymanmi kayqa chiqaptapuni munasqaykita.
He might just be it.	Payqa ichapas chaylla kanman.
I look forward to seeing it in action.	Suyachkani ruwaypi qawayta.
That there was nothing more to do.	Manaña imapas aswan ruwana kasqanmanta.
They were surprisingly good about it.	Paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi allin karqaku chaymanta.
This really made everything very real for me.	Kayqa chiqamanta tukuy imata ancha chiqap ñuqapaq ruwarqa.
That means it will go better.	Chayqa niyta munan aswan allinta rinqa.
All right, he thinks.	Allinmi, payqa yuyaykun.
So it was difficult at the time.	Chaymi chay tiempopiqa sasa karqa.
But that is not the case with you.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu qanpa hinaqa.
He is such a	Payqa chayna .
Where it had been all along.	Maypichus chay tukuy tiempo karqan chaypi.
Now, here's the problem.	Kunanqa, kaypi sasachakuy kachkan.
There he was no longer there.	Chaypiqa manañam chaypiqa karqachu.
Secrecy was important.	Pakasqa kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
If anyone can help, that would be great.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa, ancha allinmi kanman.
I couldn't watch it together.	Manam kuska qawayta atirqanichu.
I don’t know how to tell.	Manam yachanichu willakuyta.
It was always there for me.	Sapa kutim ñuqapaq karqa.
If he is not alone.	Mana sapallan kaptinqa.
Being good people.	Allin runakuna kay.
If that is the case.	Sichus chayna kanman chayqa.
Instead, it was good.	Aswanpas allinmi karqan.
He did well in doing so.	Chayta ruwaspan allinta ruwarqan.
I just did it, actually.	Chaylla ruwarqani, chiqaptaqa.
Don’t do this wrong, please.	Ama kayta mana allintachu ruwaychu, ama hina kaspa.
There are people.	Runakuna kan.
It can be very difficult.	Ancha sasa kanman.
No one knows where he is.	Manam pipas yachanchu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
He didn't know why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He asked me to help him.	Paymi niwarqa yanapanaypaq.
Not too difficult, that.	Mana ancha sasachu, chay.
I had to disagree.	Manam acuerdopichu kanay karqa.
Or this morning.	Utaq kunan paqarin.
I could talk about this all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kaymanta rimayta atiyman karqa.
He wouldn't want to, now.	Payqa manan munanmanchu, kunanqa.
It was so great!.	¡Ancha hatunmi karqa!.
You weren't there that night.	Chay tutaqa manam chaypichu karqanki.
That seems like a very long time ago.	Chayqa ancha unayñam rikchakun.
And there is no time today.	Hinaspa kunan punchawqa manam tiempo kanchu.
I can’t wait either.	Ñuqapas manam suyayta atinichu.
It’s not good there.	Chaypiqa manam allinchu.
More tired than I am, even more.	Aswan sayk’usqa ñuqamanta, astawan.
It’s still me today.	Kunankamapas ñuqam kani.
He wanted her.	Payta munarqa.
No one is good at everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imapipas allinchu.
I wanted to know a bit about everything there.	Chaypi tukuy imamanta huk chhikanta yachayta munarqani.
People want to get anywhere anywhere.	Runakunaqa maymanpas maymanpas chayayta munanku.
It will do, it will do.	Chayqa ruwanqa, chaymi ruwanqa.
That's pretty interesting, to be honest.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi, chiqap kaptinqa.
You know what he can do.	Yachankim ima ruway atisqanmanta.
I felt pretty stupid.	Allin sonso hinam tarikurqani.
So like, what do you do.	Chaymi imayna, imatataq ruwanki.
I don’t know how to deal with this.	Manam yachanichu kayta imayna atipayta.
It looks like you.	Qam hinam rikchakun.
They were both married at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa iskayninkum casarasqa karqaku.
But yeah, that was nice.	Ichaqa arí, chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Make a great gift.	Hatun regalota ruway.
But do what you can.	Ichaqa atisqaykita ruway.
Even if it’s silly, even if it’s not that good.	Mana yuyayniyuq kaptinpas, mana chayna allin kaptinpas.
If he does a bad job.	Mana allin llamkayta ruwaptinqa.
With me, he says.	Ñoqawan kuska, nispas nin.
Maybe a little more.	Ichapas huk chikan aswan.
That would be like him.	Chayta ruwasqanqa pay hinam kanman.
And to do this.	Hinaspa kayta ruwanapaq.
Otherwise, it probably isn’t.	Mana chayqa, manapaschá.
He is a very intelligent man.	Payqa allin yachaysapa runam.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Pampachaykuway.
Whoever this is.	Pipas kay kaptinpas.
This tired thing.	Kay sayk’usqa kaq.
Almost everyone is here.	Yaqa llapa runam kaypi kachkan.
I question everything, too.	Tukuy imatam tapukuni, ñuqapas.
He did as bad as anyone.	Payqa pikuna hinam mana allinta ruwarqa.
But man! 	Ichaqa runa!
All about him no.	Tukuy paymanta mana.
Actually, who knows.	Chiqaptaqa, pi yachan.
Do you think so? 	¿Chaynatachu yuyanki?
John sounds like a nice guy.	Juanqa sumaq runa hinam uyarikun.
Someone you love.	Pipas munasqayki.
He was, yes.	Payqa karqan, arí.
He’s a terribly cold guy.	Payqa manchay chiri runam.
I’ve been around for ten years.	Chunka watañam kachkani.
The first three are the most important.	Ñawpaq kinsa kaqmi aswan importante.
He went swimming.	Rirqa nadaq.
This process is included here.	Kay ruwayqa kaypi churasqa kachkan.
But knowledge knows.	Ichaqa yachay yachan.
If you’re like most people, this might come as a surprise.	Yaqa llapan runakuna hina kanki chayqa, kayqa admirakuypaqmi kanman.
Now you know better.	Kunanqa aswan allinta yachanki.
There is a long way to go for that.	Chaypaqqa unayñam kachkan.
I did it twice a week.	Semanapi iskay kutitam chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
This seems to be the best way to say it.	Kayqa aswan allin nisqa hinam.
That’s so, so wrong.	Chayqa chayna, ancha pantasqa.
That was the only downside.	Chayllam mana allinqa karqa.
But no one tried to stop him.	Ichaqa manan pipas hark’ayta munarqanchu.
If you don’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwaptikiqa.
I did it several times at home.	Wasipi achka kutita ruwarqani.
I thought it was serious.	Serio kananpaqmi piensarqani.
One, two	Huk, iskay .
It’s probably not set up properly.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu churasqa kashan.
But how do you know when that is?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq yachanki haykapi chayna kasqanmanta?.
Maybe he was a little tired.	Ichapas huk chhikanta sayk’usqa kasqa.
He was there immediately.	Payqa chayllam chaypi karqa.
More on that today.	Astawan chaymanta kunan pacha.
Anyway, it looks nice.	Imayna kaptinpas, sumaqmi rikchakun.
You’re not that good.	Manam chayna allinchu kanki.
But then he’s wrong.	Ichaqa chaymanta pantasqa.
Sure, he was nice.	Seguro, payqa sumaqmi karqan.
I can't handle that.	Chaytaqa manam manejayta atinichu.
I don’t know which one it is.	Manam yachanichu mayqin kasqanmanta.
There are the people involved.	Chaypim chaypi kaq runakunaqa kachkan.
A good one, actually.	Allin kaq, chiqaptaqa.
Experienced senior teacher.	Yachaysapa kuraq yachachiq.
I’m not the one caught.	Manam ñuqachu chay hapisqa kani.
Again this is not what a human player would do.	Yapamanta kayqa manam runa pukllaq ruwanmanchu.
Where you are.	Maypichus qam.
I’m already yours.	Ñam qampa kani.
Now he doesn’t want to go.	Kunanqa manaña riyta munanchu.
There was something else going on.	Huk ruwaymi kachkarqa.
Maybe it was good, maybe not.	Ichapas allin karqa, manapaschá.
Now that’s the food.	Kunanqa chay mikhuy.
Everyone was hungry.	Lliwmi yarqasqa karqaku.
It should do better.	Aswan allinta ruwanan.
But there is something about him.	Ichaqa kanmi paymanta imapas.
It felt like a year.	Huk wata hinam tarikurqa.
He was tired of pretending.	Payqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan hina ruwaspa.
We will always have to do it.	Sapa kutim ruwananchik kanqa.
A different thing.	Huk chikan kaq.
It doesn’t go the way it wants to.	Manan munasqanman hinachu rin.
More on that immediately.	Astawan chaymanta chaylla.
He wanted her to know that this child never existed.	Payqa munarqanmi kay wawa mana hayk’aqpas kasqanmanta yachananta.
Maybe nothing good, but whatever.	Manapaschá imapas allinchu kanman, ichaqa imapas.
It could have been a bad day.	Mana allin punchawmi kanman karqa.
Things for him.	Paypaq imakuna.
But you can do so much more with it.	Ichaqa chaywanqa aswan achkatam ruwawaq.
I’m not out there much.	Manam anchatachu hawapi kachkani.
But it is often difficult to do so.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim chayta ruwayqa sasa.
I don’t see any reason why.	Manam imaraykupas chayna kasqanmantaqa rikunichu.
They want results quickly.	Paykunaqa usqhayllan ruwaykunata munanku.
He knew he couldn't sleep.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana puñuyta atisqanmanta.
Everyone wants to be bigger and faster.	Tukuy runa aswan hatun aswan utqaylla kayta munanku.
Isn’t he though.	Manachu payqa ichaqa.
Maybe this was true.	Ichapas kayqa chiqap karqa.
He really should be proud of how he did it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin orgulloso kanan imayna ruwasqanmanta.
Everyone here wants to talk.	Kaypiqa llapa runam rimayta munanku.
Perhaps he had to do many things.	Ichapas achka ruwaykunata ruwanan karqa.
And anyone can do that.	Hinaspa pipas chayta ruwanman.
And the third person.	Hinaspa kimsa kaq runa.
That is the biggest secret.	Chayqa aswan hatun pakasqa kaqmi.
There was no immediate action.	Manam chaylla ruwayqa karqachu.
Nothing, baby.	Mana imapas, wawa.
This is not going to be an easy task at all.	Kayqa manan facil ruwaychu kanqa ni imapipas.
Yes, doing it again this year.	Arí, kay wata yapamanta ruwaspa.
He wanted it all.	Payqa tukuy chaytan munarqan.
Never mind the way it is.	Ama hayk’aqpas imayna kasqanmanta.
Second, it’s not true.	Iskay kaq, manan cheqaqchu.
Maybe it’s people.	Ichapas runakuna kanman.
He wants to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwayta munan.
So yeah, it’s good.	Chaymi arí, allinmi.
Instead, he welcomed it.	Aswanpas payqa allintan chaskirqan.
But he has no choice but to be a little curious.	Ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atinchu, aswanpas huk chhikantan yachayta munan.
This is it, baby.	Kayqa, wawa.
They were uncomfortably worried.	Paykunaqa mana allintachu llakisqa karqanku.
Please do this immediately.	Ama hina kaspa, chaylla kayta ruway.
Even if he is alone.	Sapallan kaptinpas.
Something to talk to him about.	Imapas paywan rimananpaq.
He was totally hungry this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi tukuy imamanta yarqasqa kasqa.
I still do that today.	Kunankamapas chaytam ruwani.
You know, if it’s good enough.	Yachanki, sichus allin kanman chayqa.
This statement is not exactly true.	Kay nisqanqa manan allintachu cheqaq.
Something was wrong with me.	Imapas ñuqawanqa karqa.
But nothing could stop it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chayta hark’ayta atirqanchu.
I don't know what I want to do first.	Manam yachanichu imatam puntata ruwayta munani.
Do it and stop being such a kid.	Ruway hinaspa amaña chayna wawa kaychu.
Maybe there is, anyway.	Ichapas kanman, imayna kaptinpas.
We are not so sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam chayna segurochu kanchik.
It should have been here by now.	Kunankamaqa kaypim kanan karqa.
But it should always be.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi kanan.
Perhaps they were close friends.	Yaqapaschá paykunaqa allin amigontin karqanku.
And here he saw a great opportunity.	Hinaspa kaypi huk hatun oportunidadta qhawarirqan.
I'm sure it's not true.	Seguro kani mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
You want to see if you can do better.	Qamqa qawayta munanki, aswan allinta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Never, never again.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
I know, I know.	Yachanim, yachani.
But something about him didn't seem quite right.	Ichaqa paymanta imapas mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
He doesn't care that he's hungry.	Payqa manan imananpaschu yarqasqa kasqanmanta.
He left later.	Qhepamanmi ripurqan.
But I don’t get to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwanaypaqqa tarinichu.
It was a dress.	Chayqa karqan huk p’acha.
After a while he got a fix.	Huk tiempo qhepamanmi huk allichayta hap’irqan.
Two weeks and three days.	Iskay semana kimsa punchaw.
But this will not be the case.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu kanqa.
But that probably sounds better.	Ichaqa chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allin uyarikun.
That's amazing really.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi chiqaptapuni.
Obviously this is something I want to know.	Sut’inmi kayqa yachayta munani.
As real as anyone.	Pipas hina chiqap kaq.
He sounds happy.	Payqa kusisqa uyarikun.
Who knows?! 	¿Pitaq yachan?!
You can do this well in advance.	Kaytaqa allinta ñawpaqmantaraqmi ruwawaq.
That would be safer.	Chayqa aswan seguro kanman.
Unfortunately, the process is not that simple.	Llakikuypaqmi, chay ruwayqa manam chayna facilchu.
I don’t think so, anyway.	Manam chaynataqa yuyanichu, imayna kaptinpas.
He usually did things alone.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim sapallan imatapas ruwaq.
You know, something new.	Yachanki, imapas musuq.
He didn't want to hear what she said.	Payqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu ima nisqanta.
He's been doing this all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaynata ruwachkan.
He seemed really proud of me.	Payqa chiqaptam ñuqamanta orgulloso hina karqa.
It was always going to be the next time.	Sapa kutim qatiqnin kutipi kanan karqa.
Nobody wants to be there now.	Manan pipas kunanqa chaypi kayta munanchu.
It may have been good at one time.	Yaqapaschá huk tiempopiqa allin karqa.
Anything but what he actually did.	Imapas ichaqa chiqap ruwasqanmanta.
Not much here.	Mana ancha kaypichu.
Good at school.	Yachay wasipi allin.
Adulthood was an amazing experience.	Kuraq runa kayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
You are the only one.	Qamqa chayllam kachkanki.
Nothing, nothing, nothing .	Mana imapas, mana imapas, mana imapas .
That same night.	Chay kikin tutam.
He couldn't understand it.	Chaytaqa manam entiendeyta atirqachu.
No one really knew what to do with it.	Manan pipas allintachu yacharqan chaywan ima ruwananta.
He wants to hear it.	Uyariyta munan.
This is not good at all.	Kayqa manam allinchu ni imapipas.
This is already such a bad time.	Kayqa ñam chayna millay pacha.
Even if something is good.	Imapas allin kaptinpas.
And that month you are, is.	Hinaspa chay killa kanki, kan.
If you don’t do this.	Mana kayta ruwanki chayqa.
It’s all over the place.	Tukuy chaypim kachkan.
Nasty, terrible, nasty.	Millay, manchay, millay.
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.	Allinmi, kayqa asikunapaq hinam kachkan.
That's why this thing happened.	Chayraykum kay imapas pasarqa.
Too bad he can’t be human.	Llakikuypaqmi mana runa kayta atisqanmanta.
That was better than nothing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa mana imamantapas.
He would have done that immediately.	Chaytaqa chaylla ruwanman karqa.
That something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
That wasn’t a problem.	Chayqa manan sasachu karqan.
Looking as beautiful as ever.	Ñawpaq hina sumaq rikchayniyuq.
You don’t want to hear it, and that’s okay.	Manam uyariyta munankichu, chayqa allinmi.
The inefficiency can be significant.	Chay mana allin ruwayqa hatunmi kanman.
That makes it funny.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinam ruwan.
I’m not going to be there anymore.	Manañam kasaq.
And here you go.	Hinaspa kaypi rinki.
Nothing's ever good enough for you.	Manan imapas hayk'aqpas allinchu qanpaq.
It would be sad to be there.	Llakikuypaqmi kanman chaypi kayqa.
The worst came out.	Aswan mana allinqa lluqsirqa.
Thank you indeed.	Chiqamanta gracias.
They were happy here.	Paykunaqa kaypi kusisqa karqanku.
Of course, it doesn’t.	Chiqamanta, mana.
He said that doesn't matter.	Payqa nirqam chayqa manam imananpaschu.
This guy is so nice.	Kay runaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Very nice looking guy.	Ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq.
He means what he means, what he means.	Payqa imatachus niyta munan, imatachus niyta munan.
Very nice evening.	Ancha sumaq chisi.
He could do nothing now.	Payqa manam kunanqa imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
I know you’re thinking about it.	Yachanin chayta ruwanaykipaq yuyaykusqaykita.
So this would be it, for me.	Chaymi kayqa kanman, ñuqapaq.
It is rapidly gaining popularity.	Chayqa usqhayllan aswan allin qhawarisqa kashan.
I heard what he wanted.	Uyarirqanim ima munasqanmanta.
He said everything was fast.	Tukuy imapas utqaylla kasqanmantam nirqa.
So there was a lot to do.	Chaymi achkata ruwana karqa.
You can't go hungry here.	Kaypiqa manam yarqaymanta riyta atiwaqchu.
He looked upset about something.	Payqa imamantapas phiñasqa hinan qhawarisqa.
We were always on the move.	Sapa kutim puriq kayku.
It looked like it wasn't too busy.	Mana ancha ocupasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Obviously the latter will be more effective.	Sut’inmi kay qhepa kaq aswan allin ruwaq kanqa.
I was always on the go.	Sapa kutim puriq kani.
And here it is?	Hinaspa kaypi?
But he had taken that seriously.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan qhawarisqa.
I'm sick and tired of this.	Kaymanta unqusqa, sayk'usqa ima kachkani.
Whether this is right or wrong.	Kayqa allinmi icha manachu.
I don’t want him to do that.	Manam munanichu chayta ruwananta.
He was a pretty big guy.	Payqa allin hatun runam karqa.
He immediately started walking faster.	Chayllam utqaylla puriyta qallaykurqa.
Not then, not then.	Mana chaymanta, mana chaymanta.
I am there as a human being.	Runa hinam chaypi kachkani.
Doing that for me.	Chayta ñuqapaq ruwaspa.
Doesn't sound bad if it's true.	Mana mana allintachu uyarikun chiqap kaptinqa.
I can’t go out there.	Manam chaymanqa lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
After that, everything would be the same as before.	Chay qhepamanmi tukuy imapas ñawpaq hina kanman karqan.
I hope to win.	Suyachkani atipayta.
But, like, pretty sad.	Ichaqa, hina, allinta llakisqa.
But no one is quite sure who it is.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu seguro kashan pichus chay kasqanmantaqa.
This process can be very difficult.	Kay ruwayqa ancha sasa kanman.
You know, you do it anyway.	Yachanki, imayna kaptinpas ruwanki.
I’m really sorry.	Llakikuni chiqaptapuni.
Still, if you will.	Hinallam, sichus munanki chayqa.
That this is all true.	Kay tukuy imapas chiqap kasqanmanta.
He's terrified of just about everything.	Payqa yaqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kachkan.
Not young, anywhere.	Mana wayna, maypipas.
But he couldn’t even do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
Many were unfortunately ineffective.	Achka llakikuypaqmi mana allin ruwaq karqaku.
I can't, like, take a job with you.	Manam atiymanchu, hina, qamwan huk llamkayta hapiyta.
It’s a great night.	Hatun tutam.
No, it was a wonderful time.	Manan, ancha sumaq tiempon karqan.
Everything is available.	Tukuy imapas kanmi.
It's only about an hour.	Huk hora hinallam.
He was a man there.	Payqa chaypi kaq runam karqa.
You know, or you don’t.	Yachanki, mana chayqa mana yachankichu.
They’re ten out there.	Paykunaqa chunka chay hawapi kanku.
That’s kind of crazy.	Chayqa huk laya loco.
This really doesn’t make any sense to me.	Kayqa chiqamanta mana ima yuyayniyuqchu ñuqapaq.
I really, really like this feature.	Kay ruwayqa anchata, anchata gustan.
A black man.	Huk yana runa.
I do all of that.	Tukuy chaytam ruwani.
I thought that was the right thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
Either you want it or you don’t want it.	Icha munanki icha mana munankichu.
But there were no people here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manam runakunaqa karqachu.
Where are you?!.	Maypitaq kachkanki?!.
If it’s true, it’s great.	Chiqap kaptinqa, hatunmi.
People love that.	Runakunaqa chaytan anchata munanku.
Yes, he really does.	Arí, chiqaptam chaytaqa nin.
It was bad, really bad.	Mana allinmi karqa, chiqap mana allinmi karqa.
He couldn't be sure of that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa seguro kayta atirqanchu.
He knew but said nothing.	Payqa yacharqanmi ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
We haven't done much with him so far.	Kunankamaqa manam anchatachu paytaqa ruwarqayku.
As a child, I was very curious.	Wawa kaspayqa anchatam yachayta munarqani.
I know you can't see it that way.	Yachanim mana chaynata qawayta atisqaykita.
I thought he was a wonderful man.	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq runa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
But it won’t happen before next year.	Ichaqa manan hamuq wata ñawpaqtaqa kanqachu.
Everything was as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinallam karqa.
One never knows what’s going to happen.	Huk runaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachanchu imachus kananta.
I mean tonight.	Kunan tuta niyta munani.
This seems to be the right thing to do.	Kaymi rikchakun allin ruwayqa.
She is a beautiful, worthy young woman.	Payqa sumaq, allinpaq qhawarisqa sipasmi.
it is a great achievement.	hatun ruwaymi.
I am here, not there.	Kaypim kachkani, manam chaypichu kachkani.
Maybe you can make a cup of coffee.	Ichapas huk kukata ruwawaq.
Now that’s really sick.	Kunanqa chay chiqamanta unqusqa kachkan.
That meant the right thing to do.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi niyta munarqa.
But that was a big maybe.	Ichaqa chayqa hatun ichapas karqan.
He bought it himself.	Chaytaqa paymi rantirqan.
So many things began to make sense.	Chaymi achka imakuna allinta entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
I mean, for you.	Niyta munani, qampaq.
That happened a year ago.	Chayqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
Then he knows.	Chaymanta yachan.
Too much, sometimes.	Llumpay, wakin kuti.
Maybe I should do something else.	Ichapas hukta ruwanay kanman.
No one knows why yet.	Manaraqmi pipas yachanchu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I can’t be like you.	Manan qan hina kayta atiymanchu.
Like a crazy person.	Loco runa hina.
He did everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwarqa.
You never know what happened.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus pasasqanmanta.
So he is guilty.	Chaymi pay huchayoq.
I hope that doesn’t happen again.	Suyachkani manaña chayna kananta.
I feel like a crazy person.	Loco runa hinam tarikuni.
He talked about it all the time.	Sapa kutim chaymanta rimaq.
Please tell me you know that.	Ama hina kaspa willaway chayta yachasqaykita.
There, but not really, not quite.	Chaypin, ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu, manan allintachu.
They disagree.	Paykunaqa mana acuerdopichu kachkanku.
Can't get enough of it.	Mana allintachu chaymanta hap'iyta atin.
If you have done it.	Sichus ruwarqanki chayqa.
He is everything.	Payqa tukuy imapas.
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam kusikuni.
If yes, how?.	Arí kaptinqa, ¿imaynatataq?.
Now it should be clear.	Kunanqa sut’in kanan.
In fact, it was never true.	Aswanpas manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu karqan.
What was it, he didn't care.	Imataq karqa, payqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
He didn’t know how long they had been.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a tiempo kasqankuta.
So he knows what it is like.	Chaymi payqa yachan imayna kasqanta.
I wanted to make sure you were okay.	Allin kasqaykita seguro kayta munarqani.
He said it was actually easy.	Paymi nirqa chiqaptaqa facilmi nispa.
He had to do something at night.	Payqa tutan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
You don't have to do that with it.	Chaywanqa manam chaynatachu ruwanayki.
You were like you were.	Qamqa hinam karqanki.
We did a lot of that.	Chaytaqa achkatam ruwarqayku.
But no, it was fine.	Ichaqa manan, allinmi karqan.
It is! 	¡Kayqa!
I was the first one.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqani.
I wish we could be together.	Munaymanmi karqa kuska kayta.
But not this fast.	Ichaqa manan kay usqhayllachu.
But he couldn’t get there.	Ichaqa manan chaymanqa chayayta atirqanchu.
I think you’re too big for me.	Yuyaykuni ancha hatun kasqaykita ñuqapaq.
But he sensed something was wrong with him.	Ichaqa repararqanmi imapas paywan kashasqanmanta.
I think he’ll do well.	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwananta.
It means it’s very big.	Ancha hatunmi niyta munan.
So it’s wickedly ridiculous.	Chaymi millay asikunapaq hina.
They seem to be foolish.	Paykunaqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam kanku.
Yes he is safe.	Arí payqa segurom kachkan.
Childhood.	Wawa kay.
He thought it would fail.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi mana allintachu ruwananta.
But he is not ready to be an adult.	Ichaqa manan listochu kashan kuraq runa kananpaq.
We are always together.	Sapa kutim kuska kanchik.
He always wants to hear from me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqamanta uyariyta munan.
Something goes here.	Imapas kayman rin.
This speaks volumes.	Kayqa anchatam riman.
All alone now.	Tukuy sapallan kunan.
Every year it gets bigger and bigger.	Sapa wata aswan hatunmi aswan hatunmi.
Art .	Sumaq ruway .
So this is really bad.	Chaymi kayqa chiqap mana allin.
But it’s the worst time, now.	Ichaqa aswan mana allin tiempon, kunanqa.
Not all day every day.	Mana tukuy punchawchu sapa punchaw.
I saw nothing, heard nothing.	Mana imatapas rikurqanichu, mana imatapas uyarirqanichu.
Here or outside.	Kaypi utaq hawapi.
Maybe next week, maybe next month.	Ichapas hamuq semana, ichapas hamuq killapi.
Anyone can do this.	Pipas kayta ruwayta atinman.
And more every year.	Hinaspa aswan sapa wata.
What do you want? 	Imatataq munanki?
They’re pretty injured.	Paykunaqa allin k’irisqa kanku.
But one day you will.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi ruwanki.
He said these are for you.	Paymi nirqa kaykunaqa qampaq kasqanmanta.
I was really good at it.	Chiqaptam chaypiqa allin karqani.
It’s not just me, either.	Manam ñuqallachu, nitaq.
Two days too late.	Iskay punchaw ancha tarde.
The funny thing is, this doesn’t mean anything.	Asikunapaq hinaqa, kayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
That’s great in this big city.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kay hatun llaqtapi.
I don’t want to play that game.	Manam chay pukllayta pukllayta munanichu.
No one wants to leave.	Manam pipas lluqsiyta munanchu.
Man is good.	Runa allinmi.
Do it, he said.	Ruway, nispas nisqa.
So today is the day.	Chaymi kunan punchaw.
He readily agreed to do so.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi chaylla arí nisqa.
I want to do something every day.	Sapa punchawmi imatapas ruwayta munani.
It really should have been.	Chiqaptam chayna kanan karqa.
If there is no problem.	Mana imapas sasachakuy kaptinqa.
I seemed really worried.	Chiqamanta llakisqa hinam karqani.
Eat lunch outside.	Almuerzota hawapi mikhuy.
But he couldn't do that tonight.	Ichaqa manan kunan tutaqa chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
To buy him, actually.	Payta rantinanpaq, chiqaptaqa.
Everything as it should be.	Tukuy imapas kanan hina.
But here it didn’t go so well.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan chay hina allintachu rirqan.
That will last about a week.	Chayqa yaqa huk semanan kanqa.
One will be more than enough.	Hukninmi aswan achka kanqa.
Everything is very good.	Lliwmi ancha allin.
Every last person.	Sapa qhipa kaq runa.
No one wants to hear it.	Manam pipas uyariyta munanchu.
No one did anything he wanted.	Manan pipas munasqanman hinachu imatapas ruwarqan.
Perhaps he will do so.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman.
This is a ridiculous situation.	Kayqa asikunapaq hinam kachkan.
He didn’t want to hear it or deal with it.	Payqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu nitaq chayta atipayta munarqanchu.
I seem to be doing very well.	Ancha allintam ruwachkani hina.
I still can't get over it.	Kunankamapas manam atipayta atinichu.
It happened in high school.	Chayqa pasarqa colegiopi.
I learn very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam yachani.
Why is it so slow.	¿Imanasqataq chayna.
He was very unhappy about it.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqachu kasqa chaymanta.
And then it’s morning.	Hinaspa chaymanta paqarin.
He wants to make things right.	Payqa munanmi imapas allinta ruwayta.
One of everything.	Tukuy imamanta huknin.
No one is disagreeing there.	Chaypiqa manam pipas mana acuerdopichu kachkan.
He first, then her.	Pay ñawpaqta, chaymanta pay.
I wasn’t surprised by that.	Chaywanmi mana admirakurqanichu.
I didn’t really want that.	Manam anchatachu munarqani chaytaqa.
Maybe not quite hard enough.	Ichapas mana allintachu sinchita.
Maybe he was alone.	Ichapas sapallan karqa.
I didn’t want to do those things.	Manam chaykunataqa ruwayta munarqanichu.
Pretend it’s real.	Chiqap kaqta hina ruway.
You know how to speak well.	Allin rimayta yachanki.
But that is not an easy task.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa facilchu.
Some people, nobody.	Wakin runakuna, mana pipas.
Everything is from the past.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Maybe you are and maybe you’re not.	Ichapas kanki hinaspa ichapas mana.
That sounds easy, but it is easy.	Chayqa facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa facilmi.
He was badly injured.	Payqa anchatan k’irisqa kasharqan.
He was in trouble now.	Payqa kunanmi sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
They were safe now.	Paykunaqa kunanqa allinmi karqanku.
And then again, maybe he wants to.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas payqa munan.
He has the and the .	Payqa kanmi chay hinaspa chay .
And he meant it, for the first time.	Hinaspa chayta niyta munarqan, ñawpaq kutita.
Never, ever, ever.	Mana hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas.
It’s a big deal too late.	Hatun ruwaymi ancha tarde.
I do something else? 	Ñuqaqa huk imata ruwani?
The big thing with that was time.	Chaywan hatun kaqmi karqan tiempo.
If it were just that, it would be fine.	Chaylla kanman chayqa, allinmi kanman.
He didn’t need her to do this job.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu kay llank’ayta ruwananta.
He pulled out something.	Imatapas hurqurqa.
It wasn't half bad.	Manam kuskan mana allinchu karqa.
John, almost angry.	Juan, yaqa phiñasqa.
Maybe he’ll have a party tonight.	Ichapas kunan tuta fiestata ruwanman.
At first it went well.	Ñawpaqtaqa allintam rirqa.
It seems to want to leave.	Chayqa ripuyta munanman hinam.
Said he did it anyway.	Nisqa imayna kaptinpas ruwasqanmanta.
Or is it? 	Icha?
I thought he did a great job.	Yuyarqanim ancha allin llamkayta ruwasqanmanta.
Being on time is everything.	Tiempollanpi kaymi tukuy ima.
Something he really had to do.	Imapas chiqaptapuni ruwanan karqa.
What is the name of the	Imataq sutin .
Maybe he can just walk away.	Ichapas chaylla puriyta atinman.
That wasn’t me.	Chayqa manam ñuqachu karqani.
And we had something to do that evening.	Hinaspa chay ch’isi imatapas ruwanaykupaq karqan.
They weren’t happy about it.	Paykunaqa manan chaymanta kusisqachu karqanku.
I know you are scared and alone.	Yachanim mancharisqa hinaspa sapallayki kasqaykita.
I can’t do that to him.	Chaytaqa manam paytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
I'm sure something is silly.	Seguro kani imapas mana yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
And that, after all, is the point.	Hinaspa chaymi, tukuy imamanta, aswan allinqa.
We have no idea what we’re doing.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kayku ima ruwasqaykumanta.
Everyone is happy now.	Tukuy kusisqa kunan.
I am very excited about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani.
All this happened three years ago.	Tukuy kaykunaqa kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi pasarqa.
What did you learn.	Imatataq yacharqanki.
You did that, it could be a problem.	Chayta ruwarqanki, sasachakuy kanman.
So you are very busy.	Chaymi ancha ocupasqa kanki.
He really wanted to tell a story.	Payqa anchatan munarqan huk willakuyta willayta.
I'm not doing very well.	Manam ancha allintachu ruwachkani.
I didn’t really think anything of it.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu.
We made a good meal.	Allin mikhunata ruwarqayku.
He really couldn’t hear her.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana uyariyta atirqanchu.
I don’t know why really.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chiqaptaqa.
And yes, you probably said it.	Hinaspa arí, yaqapaschá chayta nirqanki.
It’s nice, right?.	Sumaqmi, ¿aw?.
He was very pathetic.	Payqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa.
There was something.	Imapas karqan.
But there will be a time.	Ichaqa kanqa huk tiempo.
It is a quick and efficient process.	Chayqa utqaylla hinaspa allin ruwaymi.
It’s so easy to do with him.	Paywan ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
This was after all, after all.	Kaymi karqan tukuy imamanta, tukuy imamanta.
Man, that’s so fucking beautiful.	Runa, chayqa ancha millay sumaqmi.
I couldn’t bear to think about it.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu chaypi yuyaymanayta.
There was a good crowd.	Allin achka runakunam karqaku.
Whatever you want.	Ima munasqaykita.
He took the opportunity.	Payqa chay oportunidadta hap’irqan.
He wanted to be the first.	Payqa ñawpaq kaq kaytam munarqa.
Unfortunately it doesn’t really seem to exist.	Llakikuypaqmi mana chiqaptaqa kanchu hina.
I'm sure you'll be busy.	Seguro kani ocupasqa kanki.
Speed ​​was the key.	Utqaylla ruwaymi aswan allin karqa.
I think that is difficult.	Chayqa sasa kasqanmantam piensani.
I don't know this for sure like anyone else.	Kaytaqa manam pipas hinaqa segurochu yachani.
Sounds a lot awesome.	Achka manchay uyarikun.
Aw, I'm sorry! 	¡Aw!
It does no one any good to act otherwise.	Mana pimanpas allintachu ruwan huk hina ruwayqa.
I was always smart.	Sapa kutim yachaysapa karqani.
But everything was going to be fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanan karqa.
Maybe it was a nice evening.	Ichapas sumaq chisi karqa.
I still think so today.	Kunankamapas chaynatam piensani.
But this seems too simple.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha facilmi rikchakun.
It was obvious that he didn’t.	Sut’inmi karqan mana chay ruwasqanqa.
You know what people are like out here.	Yachankim kay hawapi runakuna imayna kasqankuta.
I know that is terrible.	Yachanim chayqa sinchi millay kasqanmanta.
No one knows what the future holds.	Manan pipas yachanchu hamuq tiempopi imakuna kananta.
However, it is wise not to overdo it.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman mana llumpayta imatapas ruwayqa.
In fact, it took a lot out of me.	Aswanpas achkatam ñuqamanta hurqurqa.
Do it right, don’t do it wrong.	Allinta ruway, ama mana allinta ruwaychu.
I have never seen this behavior before.	Manam haykapipas kay ruwaytaqa rikurqanichu.
Yes we have a different idea today.	Arí kunan punchawmi huk chikan yuyayniyuq kanchik.
He came earlier.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi hamurqa.
More on that soon!.	¡Astawan chaymanta chaylla!.
It didn't seem that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
The statement is clear.	Chay rimayqa sut’inmi.
Still, it was good.	Chayna kaptinpas allinmi karqa.
I would like to see it.	Munaymanmi rikuyta.
I’m going to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwasaq.
It would be nice to stop doing it.	Allinmi kanman manaña ruwayqa.
I'm tired of being scared.	Sayk'usqañan kashani mancharisqa kasqaymanta.
Better, actually.	Aswan allin, chiqaptaqa.
Is it really supposed to happen today.	¿Cheqaqtachu kunan p’unchay chayna kanan.
One of them wasn’t there.	Hukninmi mana karqachu.
But that’s everybody.	Ichaqa chaymi llapa runa.
This was doubly stupid.	Kayqa iskay kutita sonso kaymi karqa.
I’m terribly, terribly upset.	Manchay, manchay llakisqa kachkani.
But that won’t happen here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu chayqa kanqa.
He didn’t say where or how.	Payqa manan nirqanchu maypi, imaynatachus chayta.
You are the .	Qamqa kanki chay .
Many people were concerned about it.	Achka runakunam chaymanta llakisqa karqaku.
So, quick, quick.	Chaymi, utqaylla, utqaylla.
And, eventually .	Hinaspa, qhepaman .
We are proud of a lot.	Achkatam orgulloso kanchik.
Half a dozen.	Kuska chunka.
But he was really tired of doing everything by himself.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sayk’usqa kasharqan sapallan tukuy imata ruwaspa.
However, this has always been the case.	Ichaqa, sapa kutim kayna karqa.
This would be terribly inappropriate.	Kayqa manchay mana allinchu kanman.
I feel like a fool.	Ñuqaqa sonso hinam tarikuni.
I wasn’t that good.	Manam chayna allinchu karqani.
That’s where they are.	Chayqa chaypim kachkanku.
I thought, yeah right.	Yuyarqanim, arí allinta.
Maybe there was something here.	Ichapas kaypiqa imapas karqa.
Instead, be truthful.	Aswanpas cheqaq kay.
You are such a fool.	Chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
Surprisingly, I wanted to go.	Admirakuypaqmi riyta munarqani.
You can’t do anything about them.	Chaykunataqa manan ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
It’s been hidden for so long.	Chayna unayñam pakasqa.
Again, this doesn't seem safe.	Yapamanta, kayqa manam segurochu rikchakun.
Unfortunately, he had other ideas.	Llakikuypaqmi ichaqa huk yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
I did that yesterday and the day before.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi hinaspa ñawpaq punchawmi ruwarqani.
He wants to sleep but he can’t.	Puñuyta munan ichaqa manan atinchu.
It’s amazing that it still exists.	Admirakuypaqmi kunankamapas kasqanmanta.
I can't really comment on that.	Chaytaqa manam chiqaptachu rimayta atiyman.
Nobody cares who’s who.	Manan pipas imananpaschu pi pipas kasqanmantaqa.
So he did something.	Chaymi imatapas ruwarqa.
He wasn't sure why.	Payqa manan segurochu karqan imarayku chayta.
Two people were injured.	Iskay runakunam k’irisqa karqanku.
People are not happy.	Runakunaqa mana kusisqachu kanku.
You obviously can’t do this.	Sut’inmi mana kayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He had taken it seriously.	Chaytaqa allintan qhawarisqa.
Which he does quickly.	Chaytan payqa usqhaylla ruwan.
I want to walk there.	Chayman puriyta munani.
You weren’t really serious.	Manam chiqaptachu serio karqanki.
But he could not understand.	Ichaqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu.
It seems like a mistake.	Huk pantasqa hinam rikchakun.
Yes, he certainly did.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
You said that, man.	Chaytaqa nirqanki runa.
You never know what.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yachankichu imatam.
It shouldn’t be difficult.	Manam sasachu kanan.
He’s not here at all.	Payqa manan imapipas kaypi kanchu.
I spent a week in the hospital.	Huk semanan hospitalpi karqani.
I couldn't wait to see it.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu chayta qawayta.
I’m sure he couldn’t.	Seguro kani mana atisqanmanta.
It doesn’t mean it’s bad.	Manam niyta munanchu mana allin kasqanmanta.
He's not good at this.	Payqa manam kaypi allinchu.
He was the man of the house.	Payqa chay wasipi runam karqa.
Yes, this was the best.	Arí, kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
First of all, it makes no sense.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I need a cigarette.	Cigarrota necesitasaq.
He had agreed now.	Payqa kunanmi arí nisqa.
I can walk more.	Astawan puriyta atiyman.
That’s your responsibility.	Chayqa qanpa ruwanaykipaqmi.
You do a lot of good things every day.	Sapa punchawmi achka allin ruwaykunata ruwanki.
That’s how I enjoy it.	Chaynatam kusikuni.
He can go backwards.	Payqa qhepamanmi riyta atin.
Three times, people.	Kimsa kuti, runakuna.
That’s not a bad thing, that is.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu, chaymi.
I know how to wait.	Suyayta yachani.
So that was no longer the case.	Chaymi chayqa manaña karqanchu.
I can’t believe anyone else would do that.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu huk runa chayta ruwananta.
Not like last time.	Mana qayna kuti hinachu.
This is where it fails.	Kaypim mana allintachu ruwan.
But now he did.	Kunanmi ichaqa ruwarqa.
Please let me know what the problem is.	Ama hina kaspa willaway ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
But in black language.	Ichaqa yana simipi.
I never knew what the truth was about this.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu ima chiqap kaymanta kasqanmantaqa.
The result will be quick and effective.	Chay ruwayqa usqhayllan allin kanqa.
That means he is smart.	Chayqa yachaysapa kasqanmantam niyta munan.
He was, in a way, happy.	Payqa, huk hina, kusisqa karqan.
To be a fact.	Huk chiqap kananpaq.
But he thought better of it, in the end.	Ichaqa aswan allinta yuyaykurqan, tukukuypi.
That was actually fine with me though.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi karqa ñuqawan ichaqa.
However, it is completely wrong.	Ichaqa, llapanpim pantasqa kachkan.
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantam anchata llakikuni.
He wanted someone to be there.	Pipas chaypi kananta munarqa.
He was one of a kind.	Payqa huk kaqmi karqa.
The truth is, nothing really does.	Chiqap kaqmi, manam imapas chiqaptaqa ruwanchu.
Otherwise, you are a bad person.	Mana chayqa, mana allin runam kanki.
All right, good day.	Allinmi, allin punchaw.
They were bigger and better.	Paykunaqa hatun, aswan allin karqanku.
People less so.	Runakuna aswan pisi chayna.
They’re better off without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa aswan allinmi kanku.
But this guy looks familiar.	Ichaqa kay runaqa riqsisqa hinam rikchakun.
They are the best people.	Paykunaqa aswan allin runakunam kanku.
I knew this wouldn't work.	Yacharqanim kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Maybe you’ll do the right thing.	Ichapas allinta ruwanki.
He seemed tired now.	Kunanqa sayk’usqa hinan kasqa.
I’m happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusikuni.
That is why he is here with us.	Chayraykum payqa kaypi ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
It’s a lot more interesting, he said.	Achka aswan sumaqmi, nispas nin.
You want to know your truth.	Cheqaq kasqaykita yachayta munanki.
It was twenty years ago.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
That's not how you want to work this time.	Manam chaynatachu kay kutipi llamkayta munanki.
He had no idea how he would do such a thing.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chhayna ruwayta imayna ruwananta.
That doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana kasqanmanta.
It looked really good today.	Kunan punchawmi chiqap allin rikchakurqa.
It should be that easy.	Chayna facilmi kanan.
Seriously I can’t.	Serio mana atiymanchu.
He knew nothing about it for sure.	Chaymantaqa manan imatapas allintachu yacharqan.
Not yesterday or yesterday before that.	Mana qayna punchawchu nitaq qayna punchawchu chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa.
I wasn’t a yes man.	Manam arí runachu karqani.
No one else can do that.	Manan pipas chay ruwaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
Maybe he’s better.	Ichapas payqa aswan allin kanman.
If you never know .	Sichus mana hayk’aqpas yachankichu .
Now you’ll never be good at this, kid.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypi allinchu kanki, wawa.
You don’t want to leave!.	¡Manan ripuyta munankichu!.
He did much better the first time.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwarqan ñawpaq kutipi.
That’s a huge concern.	Chayqa hatun llakikuypaqmi.
Be proud of yourself when you do that.	Chayta ruwaspaqa orgulloso kay.
Not every day, you know how it is.	Mana sapa punchawchu, yachanki imayna kasqanmanta.
And he was ugly.	Hinan payqa millay karqan.
One is ready to find out what’s going on.	Hukninmi listo kashan imachus kasqanmanta yachananpaq.
But this may not be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá kayqa allinchu.
A year, a season.	Huk wata, huk pacha.
I can’t say it’s been a great year for him.	Mana niyta atiymanchu paypaq hatun wata kasqanmanta.
You’ll be out all night.	Tukuy tutan hawapi kanki.
That’s actually really nice.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi.
Big thanks for this.	Hatun gracias kaymanta.
I hope to do it again.	Suyachkani hukmanta ruwayta.
He has no intention of doing anything like that.	Payqa manan chay hinata ima ruwaytapas yuyaykunchu.
No, less impressed.	Manan, aswan pisi admirasqa.
He couldn't sit here.	Payqa manam kaypiqa tiyayta atirqachu.
There was no reason for him to do so.	Manam imaraykupas karqachu chaynata ruwananpaqqa.
This fact is very important.	Kay cheqaq kaqmi ancha importante.
He was exhausted from everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
They were really funny.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam asikunapaq hina karqaku.
Can’t wait to do this again!.	¡Manan suyayta atiymanchu kayta hukmanta ruwanaypaq!.
So please let me know what you think.	Chaymi ama hina kaspa willaway ima yuyaykusqaykita.
I almost agree with you.	Yaqa qanwan kuskan kashani.
It was like knowing the truth.	Chayqa karqan cheqaq kaqta yachay hinan.
Yes, it will be.	Arí, chayqa kanqa.
He can't seem to figure her out properly.	Manapaschá allintachu payta yuyaymanayta atinman hina.
I know they are true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqankuta.
But he realized something was wrong.	Ichaqa repararqanmi imapas mana allin kasqanta.
But this is a lot of action out of nothing.	Ichaqa kayqa achka ruwaymi mana imamanta.
You said you weren’t sure.	Mana segurochu kasqaykita nirqanki.
Unfortunately, this man was not alone.	Llakikuypaqmi kay runaqa mana sapallanchu karqa.
Indeed, he never succeeded.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana hayk’aqpas allintachu ruwarqan.
He said he wanted money.	Paymi nirqan qolqeta munani nispa.
A builder of a house.	Huk wasi ruwaq.
He had no idea what he would do next.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chay qhepaman ima ruwananta.
I mean that in the best possible way.	Chaytaqa aswan allintan niyta munani.
And if that doesn't work, go do something else.	Hinaspa chay mana allin kaptinqa, riy huk ruwayta ruwanaykipaq.
That was a good night.	Chayqa allin tutan karqan.
You said that awfully well.	Chaytaqa manchay allintam nirqanki.
More like crazy like crazy.	Aswan loco hina loco hina.
Can you do it? 	¿Atiwaqchu?
That’s probably about me .	Chayqa yaqapaschá ñoqamanta .
That was probably the hardest part.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan sasa kaq karqa.
The right thing, the right thing to do.	Allin kaq, allin yuyayniyuq.
He was worried about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta llakisqa kachkarqa.
He knew what it was like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kashasqanmanta.
He was right, but it wasn’t that simple.	Payqa allintan rimarqan, ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan.
He was drunk and happy that night.	Chay tuta machasqa kusisqa kasqa.
I am a new person.	Musuq runam kani.
Would you like to help? 	¿Yanapayta munankichu?
That it’s going to happen.	Chayna pasananta.
French time today.	Kunan punchaw francés pacha.
But this is it, this is it.	Ichaqa kaymi, kaymi.
This, of course, would be inappropriate.	Kayqa, chiqamanta, mana allinchu kanman.
Repeat twice more.	Iskay kutita yapamanta ruwana.
This is not irrelevant.	Kayqa manam mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Very excited about this.	Ancha kusisqa kaymanta.
He always refuses that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayta mana munanchu.
I would love to see where you are.	Munaymanmi maypi kasqaykita qawayta.
But he talks about it all the time.	Ichaqa sapa kutillanmi chaymanta riman.
But it all seems a little out there.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas huk chikan hawapi hinam kachkan.
Not always in a serious way.	Mana sapa kutichu serio nisqapi.
You always want this.	Sapa kutim kaytaqa munanki.
This same evening.	Kay kikin chisi.
He was worried about me that night.	Payqa chay tutam ñuqamanta llakisqa kachkarqa.
If that’s what you really want.	Sichus chayta cheqaqtapuni munanki chayqa.
It’s still pretty absurd.	Kunankamapas ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi.
He immediately began to sit down.	Chayllam tiyayta qallaykurqa.
If you want good results, you have to do the work.	Sichus allin ruwaykunata munanki chayqa, llank’ayta ruwanayki tiyan.
The latter can.	Qhipa kaq atin.
I never thought it would be like this.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayna kananta.
It’s not like that’s the case.	Manan chay hinachu kanman.
At the time, he thought nothing of it.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
Something that is not a person.	Imapas mana runachu.
He’s crazy crazy crazy.	Payqa loco loco loco.
I guess, this does though.	Suyachkani, kayqa ichaqa ruwan.
He was supposed to be happy.	Payqa kusisqam kanan karqa.
And then we did it quickly.	Hinaspa chaymanta usqhaylla ruwarqayku.
So everyone knows the truth.	Chaymi llapallanku yachanku cheqaq kaqta.
You can't be serious about this.	Kaymantaqa manam serio kayta atiwaqchu.
And you played a role in that.	Hinaspa chaypi huk ruwayta ruwarqanki.
But you wouldn’t want to be one.	Ichaqa manan huk kayta munawaqchu.
I worry about him every day.	Sapa punchawmi paymanta llakikuni.
We must continue to do so.	Hinallam ruwananchik.
That was an amazing experience to be a part of.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa chaypi kayqa.
Don’t do this horrible thing.	Ama kay millay ruwaytaqa ruwaychu.
I lived there alone.	Chaypim sapallay yacharqani.
Higher, lower.	Aswan hatun, aswan pisi.
I always wanted to do that.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwayta munarqani.
I was happy and excited.	Kusisqa hinaspa kusisqam karqani.
Something happened to him that night.	Chay tutam imapas paywan pasarqa.
I repeat this process three times.	Kay ruwayta kimsa kutita yapamanta ruwani.
This can be a tragedy.	Kayqa llakikuypaqmi kanman.
He will be as safe there as anywhere.	Payqa maypipas hinam chaypiqa seguro kanqa.
It’s surprisingly good, actually.	Admirakuypaqmi allin, chiqaptaqa.
You are, but you don’t look like it.	Qanmi kanki, ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akunki.
He told me they were fine.	Paymi niwarqa allin kasqankuta.
If anyone can help, that would be great.	Pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa, ancha allinmi kanqa.
You really never know.	Chiqaptaqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
It was indeed a wonderful day.	Cheqaqtapunin sumaq p’unchay karqan.
I hope all is well.	Tukuy imapas allin kananpaqmi suyachkani.
It would be more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi kanman.
Maybe they mean well.	Ichapas allinta niyta munanku.
But he hasn’t done that yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Yes this was a good one.	Arí kayqa allinmi karqa.
That’s what I wanted to do.	Chaynatam ruwayta munarqani.
Maybe it was you.	Ichapas qam karqanki.
This is an important one.	Kayqa importante kaqmi.
But he said nothing about the cold.	Ichaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu chiri kasqanmanta.
But seriously, it's just not that big of a deal.	Ichaqa serio, chaylla mana chay hatun ruwaychu.
We are doing a really good job.	Chiqap allin ruwaymi kachkaniku.
Personality is important.	Imayna runa kayqa ancha allinmi.
They were in the living room.	Paykunaqa tiyaq wasipi karqanku.
He was going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi karqa.
He cannot be happy.	Payqa manan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu.
Maybe we have to do that, again, this year.	Ichapas chaynata ruwananchik kanqa, yapamanta, kay wata.
The most important thing is to be happy.	Tukuy imamanta aswan allinqa kusisqa kaymi.
One thing is another.	Huk kaqmi huk kaq.
If this is not good, it can be very bad.	Kay mana allin kaptinqa, sinchi mana allinchu kanman.
Nothing is wrong with it.	Mana imapas mana allinchu.
That was probably quick.	Chayqa yaqapaschá usqhaylla karqan.
Learn how one more than one.	Yachay imaynatas huk aswan huk.
We’re fine with that.	Allinmi kachkaniku chaywanqa.
I know everything about him by now.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imatam paymanta yachani.
Maybe once every two weeks.	Ichapas iskay semanapi huk kutita.
That’s what he always says.	Chaynatam sapa kuti nin.
It’s been a very bad week.	Ancha mana allin semanan karqan.
The truth was, he hadn’t thought of it.	Cheqaq kaqmi karqan, manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
He left two weeks ago.	Iskay semana ñawpaqtaraqmi ripurqan.
I really look forward to seeing this work.	Chiqaptam suyachkani kay llamkayta qawayta.
He wasn’t happy here.	Payqa manan kaypi kusisqachu kasharqan.
Some, but some.	Wakin, ichaqa wakin.
So don't forget, now.	Chaymi ama qunqaychu, kunanqa.
But now maybe.	Ichaqa kunanqa ichapas.
I really don't know much about it.	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu chaymantaqa yachani.
But I want to get one.	Ichaqa hukta hap’iyta munani.
He could not understand what had happened.	Payqa manan imachus pasasqanmantaqa entiendeyta atirqanchu.
He couldn't bear to hear a word.	Manas aguantayta atirqachu huk simita uyariyta.
I thought it was better that way.	Chay hinaqa aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
Not like that, he said.	Mana chaynatachu, nispa.
But this isn’t really unique.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kayqa sapallan.
Which is the reality in the world.	Imataq kay pachapi chiqap kaq.
He wanted to say something.	Payqa imatapas niyta munarqa.
Afterwards, he looked down on her.	Chay qhepamanmi payqa mana allin qhawarisqa hina qhawarisqa.
Go outside with it.	Chaywanqa hawaman riy.
He was very happy to leave.	Ancha kusisqam chaymanta lluqsirqa.
It was like the weather.	Tiempo hinam karqa.
I think this wasn’t always the case.	Yuyaykuni manan sapa kutichu kay hina karqan.
But she can't talk to him about anything now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imamantapas paywan rimayta atinchu.
Most of the night, at least.	Yaqa llapan tutam, aswanpas.
I actually don’t really know.	Chiqaptaqa manam chiqaptaqa yachanichu.
Maybe a few people.	Ichapas huk iskay kimsa runakuna.
It always looked like this.	Sapa kutim kayna rikchakurqa.
But don't do anything now.	Ichaqa kunanqa ama imatapas ruwaychu.
We cannot be here without time.	Kaypi pacha mana kaptinqa manam kayta atichwanchu.
Everyone was tired.	Lliwmi sayk'usqa karqanku.
It happened last year.	Qayna wata pasarqa.
I know it’s going to be hard.	Yachanim sasa kananta.
This one caught on.	Kayqa hap’irqan.
He can never be sure.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas segurochu kanman.
He may not take any action.	Yaqapaschá mana ima ruwaytapas ruwanmanchu.
I can't let this go.	Kaytaqa manam saqiyta atiymanchu.
That sounds all right.	Chayqa tukuy allinmi uyarikun.
More than anything in the world.	Kay pachapi imamantapas aswan achka.
But ultimately it won’t.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi mana kanqachu.
Yes, it was a nasty winter.	Arí, millay chiri tiempon karqan.
Not often, but yes, sometimes.	Mana sapa kutichu, ichaqa arí, wakin kuti.
He opened a door.	Huk punkuta kicharirqa.
Maybe, you know.	Ichapas, yachanki.
Not even looked at.	Nitaq qhawarisqa.
They are scared and frightened.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
Many people here are easy.	Kaypi achka runakunaqa facilmi.
A few years younger.	Iskay kimsa wata sullk’a.
But there was one thing he wouldn't do.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi karqan mana ruwananchu.
But there are two possibilities.	Ichaqa iskay ruwaymi kanman.
And that’s all it will be.	Hinaspa chaylla kanqa.
He always did, now.	Payqa sapa kutim ruwaq, kunanqa.
He looked at things.	Imakunatapas qhawarisqa.
But the moon.	Ichaqa killa.
It's not worth it to you.	Manam valenchu ​​qampaq.
He always did the same things.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna ruwaykunata ruwaq.
An hour passed, maybe two.	Huk hora pasarqa, ichapas iskay.
I barely saw him.	Yaqapaschá paytaqa rikurqani.
He couldn't go along with it.	Payqa manam chaywanqa riyta atirqachu.
Something must be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanan.
He got it, at least.	Payqa chaytan chaskirqan, aswanpas.
I was there for the guy.	Chaypin karqani.
In fact, they are increasingly popular.	Chiqamanta, astawan riqsisqa kanku.
They have a lot of ideas.	Paykunaqa achka yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Or last night.	Utaq qayna tuta.
He did it to the best of his ability.	Chaytaqa atisqanman hinan ruwarqan.
And then people.	Hinaspa chaymanta runakuna.
So he talks about it again.	Chaymi hukmanta riman.
That, at least, was something.	Chayqa, aswanpas, imapas karqan.
No, no, it will be here soon.	Manan, manan, pisi tiempollamantan kaypi kanqa.
Another quick one.	Huk utqaylla kaq.
I guess that is the problem.	Chayqa chay sasachakuy kasqanmantam suyachkani.
He wants to get caught.	Munan hap’isqa kayta.
There is no me or you.	Manam ñuqapas qampas kanchu.
Yes, indeed he is.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin paymi.
Too many adults.	Ancha achka kuraq runakuna.
That he can overcome it.	Chayta pay atipananta.
It just, it wasn’t there.	Chaylla, manas karqachu.
Very sad indeed.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi chiqaptapuni.
They certainly can be.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin kanman.
He wanted to leave, quickly.	Payqa ripuyta munarqa, utqaylla.
Didn't mean that much more.	Mana chaynatachu astawan niyta munarqa.
Wherever that is.	Maypipas chay.
You have always existed.	Qamqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqanki.
Now he was furious.	Kunanqa sinchita phiñasqa kasharqan.
It was the easiest person to be.	Chayqa karqan aswan facil runa kaymi.
But this one can.	Ichaqa kaymi atin.
Many people are more nervous.	Achka runakunam aswan mancharisqa kanku.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqachu.
Probably somewhere around a week.	Yaqapaschá maypipas huk semana hina.
That, first of all, wasn’t like him.	Chayqa, ñawpaqtaqa, manan pay hinachu karqan.
I don't know what he was thinking.	Mana yachanichu ima piensasqanmanta.
He was sick of it, sick of wanting her.	Payqa chaywan unqusqa, payta munasqanmanta unqusqa.
He said, this is amazing.	Paymi nirqa, kayqa admirakuypaqmi.
I am most terribly depressed.	Aswan manchay llakisqa kachkani.
I don’t want to think about it now.	Manam kunanqa chaypi yuyaymanayta munanichu.
It’s about everything.	Tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
If you don’t agree, you don’t agree.	Mana acuerdopichu kanki chayqa, manan acuerdopichu kanki.
Everyone was really really excited.	Lliwmi chiqaptapuni chiqap kusisqa karqaku.
Do the third thing.	Chay kimsa kaqta ruway.
He is, that’s true.	Payqa, chaymi chiqap.
It’s just not good enough for me.	Chaylla mana allinchu ñuqapaq.
At least right now.	Aswan pisi kunanpacha.
I think so, yes.	Chaynatam piensani, arí.
I had strange thoughts.	Mana riqsisqa yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
I love fast food, too.	Ñuqapas anchatam munani chaylla mikuyta, ñuqapas.
Always alone.	Sapa kuti sapallayki.
And he wanted to be there.	Hinaspa chaypi kayta munarqan.
It’s very good, he says.	Ancha allinmi, nispas nin.
Something beautiful, something good.	Imapas sumaq, imapas allin.
I was all alone.	Tukuy sapallay karqani.
Yes, you were the one.	Arí, qanmi karqanki.
It’s sad to agree.	Llakikuypaqmi acuerdopi kayqa.
He asked the right question.	Chaytaqa allintan tapurqan.
Early in the morning.	Tutamanta pacha.
That will be the best.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
You are here to do something.	Imatapas ruwanaykipaqmi kaypi kachkanki.
Okay, that last one may not be true.	Allinmi, chay qhepa kaq manapaschá cheqaqchu.
This is the week to do just that.	Kaymi chayta ruwanapaq semana.
Both suffered multiple serious head injuries.	Iskayninkun askha hatun uma k’irisqa karqanku.
I couldn’t let him win.	Manam atipananta saqiyta atirqanichu.
Why is it here? 	¿Imaraykutaq kaypi?
Not very often, at least.	Mana ancha sapa kutichu, aswanpas.
Many people know the story.	Achka runakunam chay willakuyta yachanku.
Actually he was happy.	Chiqaptaqa payqa kusisqam karqa.
They are very intelligent people.	Paykunaqa ancha yachaysapa runakunam.
He was alone a lot of the time now.	Payqa sapallanmi karqan askha tiempo kunan.
He was exiled from the country.	Paymi nacionmanta qarqosqa karqa.
But it really is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
I knew these things.	Chaykunataqa yacharqanim.
You can do that today if you want.	Munaspaqa kunan punchawmi chaytaqa ruwawaq.
He’s never been like this before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa karqanchu.
And he said, 'It's.	Hinan payqa nisqa.
I just couldn’t stand it anymore.	Chaylla manaña aguantayta atirqanichu.
You will need to do this several times.	Chaytaqa askha kutitan ruwanayki kanqa.
Does anyone know how to fix this problem.	¿Pipas yachanchu kay sasachakuy allichayta.
There was this one, there was that one.	Kay hukninmi karqan, chay hukninmi karqan.
The person you love.	Munasqayki runa.
That wasn’t the real thing.	Chayqa manan cheqaq ruwaychu karqan.
But you don’t want to be with me.	Ichaqa manan munankichu ñoqawan kuska kayta.
So that’s pretty short-sighted.	Chaymi chayqa ancha pisi yuyayniyuq.
He wasn’t happy at all.	Payqa manan ni imapipas kusisqachu kasqa.
It wasn’t good to be here.	Mana allinchu karqa kaypi kayqa.
They want you to succeed.	Paykunaqa munanku allinta ruwanaykita.
Actually, not quite.	Chiqaptaqa, manam allintachu.
The third step was more interesting.	Kimsa kaq ruwayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
But nothing about it seems right.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaymantaqa allinchu rikch’akun.
He was a really nice looking guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq rikchayniyuq runam karqa.
They were both ridiculously happy.	Iskayninkum asikunapaq hina kusisqa karqaku.
He can be irregular.	Payqa mana sapa kutillanmi kanman.
If anything seemed upset.	Sichus imapas phiñasqa hina karqan.
That one, yeah.	Chay huknin, arí.
He thought that was better.	Payqa chayta aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqan.
You really don’t want to know what’s going to happen next.	Cheqaqtapunin mana yachayta munankichu imakuna qhepaman pasananta.
That you are here with me.	Kaypi ñuqawan kasqaykita.
They were good though.	Paykunaqa allinmi karqanku ichaqa.
I want to live in the city.	Llaqtapi tiyayta munani.
A weekly routine is important.	Sapa semana ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
But I don’t think he could do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu, nispaymi yuyaykuni.
But he knew how to do it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwananta.
Yes, they do exist.	Arí, paykunaqa kanmi.
He said several times that this would be good.	Payqa achka kutitam nirqa kayqa allin kanqa nispa.
It’s there somewhere.	Maypipas chaypi kachkan.
This is a wonderful man.	Kayqa huk sumaq runam.
He was expelled.	Payqa qarqosqa karqan.
That’s all he wanted.	Chayllam munarqa.
It is usually the way it is.	Yaqa llapanpim imayna kasqanmanta.
What’s coming up.	Imataq hamunqa.
You can’t say it anymore.	Manañam niyta atiwaqchu.
Right now, with us.	Kunanpacha, ñuqaykuwan.
That it was so important to him.	Chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta paypaq.
Anyone, that’s all.	Pipas, chaylla.
He knew the story very well.	Payqa ancha allintam chay willakuyta yacharqa.
At first nothing was right.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
No, he wasn't sure he liked that better.	Manan, manan segurochu karqan chayta aswan gustasqanmanta.
I agree with all of them.	Llapallankum acuerdopi kani.
Say something nice.	Imapas sumaq kaqta niy.
Canadians are nice.	Canadá runakunaqa sumaqmi kanku.
I really don't know what to make of this.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
That he wanted better.	Aswan allinta munasqanmanta.
Okay a big problem.	Allinmi huk hatun sasachakuy.
That was certainly the worst part of it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymi aswan mana allinqa karqan.
There was no greater good.	Manam aswan hatun allinqa karqachu.
This is absurd.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi.
People who do better in school.	Yachay wasipi aswan allinta ruwaq runakuna.
In fact, that may not seem like it.	Aswanpas chayqa manapaschá hinachu kanman.
Now you are a different person.	Kunanqa huk runam kanki.
If you want to know what that thing is.	Sichus yachayta munanki imachus chay imapas kasqanmanta.
So it’s true.	Chaymi chiqap.
You know that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yachanki.
That’s always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim chayna.
Once for him.	Huk kutilla paypaq.
Anyone or	Pipas utaq .
Of course, he probably would.	Arí, yaqapaschá chaytaqa munanman.
That’s another though.	Chayqa huk ichaqa.
I’m afraid it’s going to happen.	Manchakuni chayna kananta.
You probably know things.	Yaqapaschá imakunatapas yachanki.
I do do the work.	Ñuqaqa ruwani ruwayta.
But that’s for later.	Ichaqa chayqa qhepamanmi.
He is afraid of what he will do.	Payqa manchakunmi ima ruwananta.
That was a little uncomfortable.	Chayqa huk chikan mana allinchu karqa.
He didn't need that now.	Payqa manan kunanqa chayta necesitarqanchu.
But no one noticed them.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaykunataqa repararqanchu.
So far it has been every day.	Kunankamaqa sapa punchawmi chayna karqa.
Nasty, but effective.	Millay, ichaqa allin ruwaq.
If you don’t want to, that is.	Manachus munanki chayqa, chaymi.
If you’re in the car then, well you know.	Sichus carropi kanki chaymanta, allinmi yachanki.
And he said things.	Hinan imakunatapas nirqan.
He was very lucky indeed.	Payqa ancha suerteyoqmi karqan cheqaqtapuni.
You did something really really well.	Chiqap chiqap allintam imatapas ruwarqanki.
The process itself went well.	Kikin ruwayqa allintam rirqa.
This would be a new, challenging world for me.	Kayqa huk musuq, sasachakuy pacha kanman ñuqapaq.
It wasn’t what he said it would be.	Manam nisqanman hinachu karqa.
Learn to let go.	Saqiyta yachay.
That’s what I have to do.	Chaynatam ruwanay.
If he does, that’s fine.	Chayta ruwaptinqa allinmi.
I’m not good enough for that.	Chaypaqqa manam allinchu kani.
A true stranger.	Chiqap mana riqsisqa runa.
He really seemed curious.	Payqa chiqaptam rikchakurqa yachay munasqanman hina.
A lot of young, famous people.	Achka wayna, riqsisqa runakuna.
I could never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu karqa.
I can't bear to watch.	Manam aguantayta atinichu qawayta.
I would have to agree.	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kanay kanman.
It wasn’t all that good.	Manam tukuy chay allinchu karqa.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaynataqa munarqanichu.
I know you want to see him.	Yachanim payta qawayta munasqaykita.
The disabled set.	Chay mana puriq churasqa.
That’s the cold.	Chayqa chiri.
He wasn’t good at it.	Payqa manan chaypiqa allintachu yacharqan.
No, he didn’t want to see her.	Manan, manan paytaqa rikuyta munarqanchu.
If you think it would be good.	Sichus yuyanki chayqa allinmi kanman.
The process was ridiculous.	Chay ruwayqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
Maybe he couldn’t do it.	Ichapas mana ruwayta atirqachu.
No one wanted anything to do with it.	Manan pipas chaywanqa ima ruwaytapas munarqanchu.
Don’t do that to him.	Ama chaytaqa paytaqa ruwaychu.
I mean, he still is.	Niyta munani, payqa hinallam kachkan.
I'm busy, anyway.	Ocupasqa kachkani, imayna kaptinpas.
And now it was as good a time as ever.	Hinaspa kunanqa ñawpaq hina allin tiempo karqan.
Learn to walk.	Puriyta yachay.
Still good, but older.	Hinallam allin, ichaqa kuraq.
This is my first time here.	Kaymi ñawpaq kuti kaypi kachkani.
But now I am the only one here.	Ichaqa kunanqa ñuqallam kaypi kachkani.
It was his greatest moment.	Chayqa karqan aswan hatun tiempon.
Today with me.	Kunan punchaw ñuqawan.
It was a cold, miserable night.	Chayqa chiri, mana allin tutam karqa.
Therefore, we must do this.	Chayraykum kayta ruwananchik.
He was the first to speak.	Paymi ñawpaqtaqa rimaq.
It’s so beautiful there.	Chaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.
I can’t sound familiar.	Manam riqsisqa uyariyta atiymanchu.
He wanted to know, that was all.	Payqa yachayta munarqa, chayllam karqa.
There will be no one.	Manam pipas kanqachu.
What kind of person.	Imayna runa.
But it had to be there.	Ichaqa chaypim kanan karqa.
Now I have serious doubts about this.	Kunanqa anchatam iskayrayani kaymanta.
They were so amazing.	Paykunaqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
He will certainly be tired here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi sayk’usqa kanqa.
That might not be such a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá chhayna mana allinchu kanman.
One day and one night and one day.	Huk punchaw huk tuta huk punchaw.
Household man.	Wasi runa.
Everyone wants to know what’s in it.	Lliwmi yachayta munanku chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
Would this be a good idea.	Allinchu kanman kayqa.
He’s going to be the one.	Paymi kanqa.
These same people.	Kay kikin runakuna.
This seemed pretty amazing.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
Not really, he said that yesterday.	Mana chiqaptachu, qayna punchawmi chayta nirqa.
That was a period of time.	Chayqa huk tiempon karqan.
Today at home.	Kunan punchaw wasipi.
Two or three.	Iskay kimsa.
I couldn’t protect her from him.	Manam paymanta harkayta atirqanichu.
I’m sure that would have been better.	Seguro kani chay ruwayqa aswan allin kanman karqan.
So this is a challenge.	Chaymi kayqa huk sasachakuy.
He looked very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa qhawarisqa.
I want to tell you why.	Willayta munani imarayku chayta.
Be with him a lot.	Paywan achkata kay.
That’s a really, really hard thing to do.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap sasa ruwaymi.
Everything happened too fast.	Tukuy imapas llumpay utqayllam pasarqa.
We are, together.	Kanchik, kuska.
Maybe he can’t.	Ichapas mana atinmanchu.
I don’t think it will do well.	Manam allintachu ruwananta yuyani.
A lot of good people get hurt.	Achka allin runakunam k’irisqa kanku.
But, yes, that means a lot.	Ichaqa, arí, chay ruwayqa anchatam nin.
It’s not the case.	Manan chay hinachu kashan.
A week, maybe, every year.	Huk semana, ichapas, sapa wata.
And then something went terribly wrong.	Hinaspa chaymanta imapas manchay mana allinchu pasarqa.
You can pretty much do whatever you want.	Yaqapaschá munasqaykita ruwawaq.
An afternoon at home.	Wasipi huk tarde.
They are not like adults.	Paykunaqa manan kuraq runakuna hinachu kanku.
It’s a very good day.	Ancha allin punchawmi.
As usual, he was joined by a large crowd.	Sapa kuti hinam achka runakuna paywan kuska karqaku.
There is no such thing as a statement.	Manam chayna rimayqa kanchu.
Tell the truth.	Chiqap kaqta willay.
All the same things really.	Tukuy kikin imakuna chiqap.
Not very well, either.	Mana ancha allintachu, nitaq.
He’s more human than I am.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan runa.
And sure enough, it happened.	Hinaspa seguro, chaymi pasarqa.
Performance was nothing bad.	Ruwayqa mana ima mana allinchu karqa.
Several times in fact.	Achka kuti chiqaptaqa.
I'll do it right.	Allinta ruwasaq.
He wouldn't be there without me.	Mana ñuqawanqa manam chaypichu kanman.
That was a good thing, not a bad thing.	Chayqa allin ruwaymi karqan, manan mana allinchu karqan.
But this was crazy.	Ichaqa kayqa loco hinam karqa.
Who wants to sit down.	Pitaq tiyayta munan.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap.
No one seemed right.	Manam pipas allinchu rikchakurqa.
I’m a player.	Ñuqaqa pukllaqmi kani.
Do it alone, you know.	Sapallan ruway, yachanki.
You just can’t walk away.	Chaylla mana puriyta atiwaqchu.
It’s always a process.	Sapa kutim huk ruway.
I feel kind of trapped.	Ñuqaqa huk laya hap’isqa hinam tarikuni.
I didn’t want to hear anything from him.	Manam imatapas paymanta uyariyta munarqanichu.
I don’t think it will help.	Mana yuyanichu yanapananta.
Make it work for you.	Qanpaq allin kananpaq ruway.
Why did this happen?'	¿Imanasqataq kay karqa?’, nispa.
He wouldn't want to see her any more.	Payqa manañan astawan rikuyta munanmanchu karqan.
However, this is not a good practice.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manam allinchu.
I was sad and a little sad.	Llakisqa hinaspa huk chhikanta llakisqa karqani.
If not true, great.	Mana chiqap kaptinqa, hatunmi.
I am happy now.	Kunanqa kusisqam tarikuni.
Evil does not know.	Mana allinqa manam yachanchu.
This more important.	Kay aswan importante.
I think it’s a good thing to do.	Allinmi kanman chayta ruwayqa, nispan yuyaykuni.
I want to sleep.	Puñuyta munani.
I feel like I’m hungry.	Yarqasqa hinam tarikuni.
I wanted to believe them.	Chaykunataqa creeyta munarqani.
No one seems to know what happened to it.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imachus chaywan pasasqanmantaqa.
If anything he was a good man.	Sichus imapas allin runa karqan.
He says he doesn't want this to happen to other people.	Paymi nin mana munanchu kay pasananta huk runakuna.
It sounds really easy.	Chiqamanta mana sasachu uyarikun.
He doesn't want anything.	Payqa manam imatapas munanchu.
Don't know when you're actually there, either.	Ama yachankichu hayk'aqpas chiqap chaypi kasqaykita, nitaq.
He couldn’t tell her anything.	Payqa manan imatapas willayta atirqanchu.
It would have been ten years.	Chunka watañam kanman karqa.
I knew you could.	Yacharqanim atisqaykita.
I don't see why that would be.	Manam rikunichu imanasqa chayna kanman chaytaqa.
Yes, according to another statement.	Arí, huk nisqanman hina.
This is somebody.	Kayqa wakin runam.
But he knew he didn't like it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta mana gustasqanmanta.
That, as always, was great.	Chayqa, sapa kuti hina, ancha allinmi karqa.
I couldn't do it now, anyway.	Manam kunanqa ruwayta atirqanichu, imayna kaptinpas.
Very nice guy, always happy.	Ancha sumaq wayna, sapa kuti kusisqa.
It’s no longer about anything.	Manañam imamantapas kanchu.
But he knew it would never be good.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas allin kananta.
He walked away from it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chaymantaqa puriq.
But it was a bit difficult.	Ichaqa huk chhikantan sasa karqan.
He tried, though.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi ichaqa.
I don’t want to hear anything from you.	Manam imatapas qanmanta uyariyta munanichu.
There is no anonymous word.	Manam kanchu mana sutiyuq rimayqa.
Depressed sick people.	Llakisqa unqusqa runakuna.
It was a little sad.	Huk chikan llakikuypaqmi karqa.
No, and it doesn’t mean better.	Manan, nitaq aswan allin niyta munanchu.
It’s not real wealth.	Manan cheqaq qhapaq kaychu.
But no, he couldn’t talk to anyone.	Ichaqa manan, manan piwanpas rimayta atirqanchu.
Can't really get to where the problem is.	Mana chiqaptachu chayayta atin maypi sasachakuy kachkan.
He said he couldn’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atisqanmanta nisqa.
I have so much to do.	Anchatam ruwanay kachkan.
As far as you are concerned, he does not exist.	Qampaq hinaqa, payqa manam kanchu.
There was a third person.	Kimsa kaq runam karqa.
We talked all the time.	Sapa kutim rimaq kayku.
It’s a good thing.	Allinmi kasqanmanta.
Maybe go talk to him.	Ichapas paywan rimaq riy.
He is happy for me.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan ñuqapaq.
The learning process is very simple.	Yachay ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
Another child again.	Huk wawa yapamanta.
You, man.	Qamqa, runa.
It was no longer a good thing.	Manañam allinchu karqa.
I'm not sure, now.	Manam segurochu kani, kunanqa.
He couldn't really hear anything.	Manam imatapas chiqaptapuni uyariyta atirqachu.
You have no idea what anything is.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki imachus imapas kasqanmanta.
It could have been something.	Imapas kanman karqa.
Thank you for saying.	Gracias niyta.
And again, maybe he wouldn’t.	Hinaspa yapamanta, ichapas mana chayta ruwanmanchu.
It was supposed to be yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi kanan karqa.
He said he wanted to come.	Hamuyta munan nispa.
Obviously they still exist.	Sut’inmi kunankamapas kashanku.
It does two things.	Iskay ruwaykunata ruwan.
I have no idea what to do about this.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imata ruwanaypaq kaymanta.
He didn’t really want that.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa munarqan.
Does anyone know what that could have been.	¿Pipas yachanchu imachus chay kanman karqan chayta.
That's there, all right.	Chayqa chaypim kachkan, allinmi.
It was a cold day.	Chay punchawmi chiri karqa.
He looked furious.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa hinan qhawarisqa.
I can do that tomorrow.	Paqarinmi chayta ruwayman.
He barely walked.	Payqa yaqapaschá puriq.
He doesn’t care about that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan imananpaschu.
Again he was a bigger man.	Yapamanta aswan hatun runa kasqa.
Good, innocent people.	Allin, mana huchayoq runakuna.
Otherwise, nothing means anything.	Mana chayqa, manam imapas imatapas niyta munanchu.
Now this was just the case.	Kunanqa kayqa chayllaraqmi karqa.
It does the job.	Chaytaqa ruwan.
I could see no other way.	Manam huk ñanta rikuyta atirqanichu.
It’s not a difficult task.	Manam sasa ruwaychu.
Someone wanted to talk to him.	Pipas paywan rimayta munarqa.
Tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock.	Paqarin tarde kimsa horasta.
Something he hasn’t done yet.	Imapas manaraq ruwasqanmanta.
He said things to her.	Payqa imakunatapas nirqam.
This is truly home for me.	Kayqa chiqamanta wasi kay ñuqapaq kachkan.
It’s not a new practice.	Manan mosoq ruwaychu.
He couldn’t stop her.	Mana hark’ayta atirqanchu.
Yeah, that’s for sure.	Arí, chayqa seguro.
He tried to stop her, but not fast enough.	Payqa hark’ayta munarqan, ichaqa manan usqhayllachu.
I thought that would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman nispaymi nirqani.
That would be very unreasonable.	Chayqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
And the .	Hinaspa chay .
I’m all right.	Tukuy allinmi kani.
This may not make sense.	Kayqa manapaschá imapaqpas valenchu.
It was good but this was great.	Allinmi karqa ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I think he can do well.	Allintam ruwayta atinman nispam piensani.
Everything seemed unreal.	Tukuy imapas mana chiqap hinam karqa.
It wasn’t like anything else.	Manan huk hinachu karqan.
I didn’t know what you were going to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaykita.
This is actually a big deal.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa hatun ruwaymi.
It's been about a year now.	Yaqa huk watañam kunanqa.
These will always be there.	Kaykunaqa tukuy tiempon kanqa.
I mean very quickly.	Niyta munani ancha utqaylla.
I know it's for the best though.	Yachanim ichaqa allinpaq kasqanmanta.
It’s surprisingly good.	Admirakuypaqmi allin.
I thought it was better.	Aswan allin kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He couldn't remember what.	Manas yuyariyta atirqachu imata.
You probably didn’t know that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa mana yacharqankichu.
However, this would be a misguided approach.	Ichaqa kayqa pantasqa ruwaymi kanman.
Now, that’s .	Kunanqa, chayqa .
Sounds like a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruway hinam uyarikun.
He always made me better.	Payqa sapa kutim aswan allinta ruwawaq.
And really, me too.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni, ñuqapas.
Tell me everything you know.	Tukuy yachasqaykita willaway.
Be proud but don’t be arrogant.	Orgulloso kay ichaqa ama orgulloso kaychu.
She wanted more time like him.	Payqa pay hinan aswan tiempota munarqan.
He rode a bicycle.	Payqa bicicletapi puriq.
They are really nice though.	Paykunaqa chiqap sumaqmi ichaqa.
Today with us always.	Kunan punchaw ñuqaykuwan sapa kuti.
And now he was lucky.	Hinaspa kunanqa suerteyoqmi karqan.
He had to do this tough.	Payqa kayta sinchitan ruwanan karqan.
He eventually succeeded.	Payqa qhepamanmi allinta ruwarqan.
I can get out of the way.	Lluqsiyta atiyman.
I'm sure it's really easy.	Seguro kani chiqap facil kasqanmanta.
That is the next step.	Chayqa qatiqnin ruwaymi.
You are not that kind of person.	Manam chayna runachu kanki.
Yes he is.	Arí payqa.
You probably know something about it.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa imatapas yachanki.
Baby, baby, he says.	Wawa, wawa, nispas nin.
Every smoker would love to be like you.	Llapa cigarrota pitaq anchata munanman qan hina kayta.
They seem proud of it.	Chaymantaqa orgulloso hinam kanku.
I didn't really think about it.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani.
He couldn’t eat it.	Manam mikuyta atirqachu.
There is nothing better anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam imapas aswan allinqa kanchu.
That was the only thing that was good.	Chayllam allin karqa.
But a little sad for me.	Ichaqa huk chikan llakisqa ñuqapaq.
Now it’s not really.	Kunanqa manan cheqaqtachu.
Do it for yourself, too.	Qampas qampaq ruway.
But there they really are.	Ichaqa chaypiqa cheqaqtapunin kashanku.
Everything is that much harder to do.	Tukuy imapas chayna aswan sasa ruwaymi.
And it’s a really really hard thing to do.	Hinaspa chiqap chiqap sasa ruwaymi.
I’m sorry we did that.	Pampachaykuway chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
He finds himself alone.	Payqa sapallanmi tarikun.
Okay, say something.	Allinmi, imatapas niy.
He looked sad, but it was something else.	Payqa llakisqa qhawarisqa, ichaqa huk ruwaymi karqan.
Thus it is not like this.	Chay hinaqa manan kay hinachu.
Which is kinda crazy.	Imataq huk laya loco.
I didn’t want to do that.	Manam chaynata ruwayta munarqanichu.
Someone was hurt.	Pipas k’irisqa karqan.
Surprisingly, he was depressed.	Admirakuypaqmi payqa llakisqa tarikurqa.
But he doesn’t always do that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwan.
That’s right for you.	Chayqa qampaq hinam.
He has some very strong opinions.	Payqa wakin ancha sinchi yuyayniyuqmi.
I guess I'm not doing so well now.	Yaqapaschá kunanqa mana chayna allintachu ruwachkani.
I will no longer be a nice person.	Manañam sumaq runachu kasaq.
I hope this year won’t be the case.	Suyachkani kay wata mana chayna kananta.
It’s not very easy.	Manam ancha facilchu.
Obviously, that wasn’t like him.	Sut’inmi, chayqa manan pay hinachu karqan.
It’s so good!.	¡Ancha allinmi!.
So he accepted it.	Chaymi payqa chayta chaskirqan.
She was afraid to leave him.	Payta saqiyta mancharisqa.
You know that very well.	Chaytaqa allintan yachanki.
I’m not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kani.
It’s not always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna.
I probably went too far with you.	Yaqapaschá qanwan kuska nishuta rirqani.
Where he went, what he did.	Mayman rirqa, ima ruwasqanmanta.
But people.	Ichaqa runakuna.
It was a really nice time.	Chiqamanta sumaq tiempo karqa.
There is no such reason.	Chay hinaqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
We did it again and again.	Yapamanta yapamanta ruwarqayku.
Which, you know, is really fucking important.	Imataq, yachanki, chiqamanta millay importante.
I suspect now it may be.	Sospechani kunanqa ichapas chayna kasqanmanta.
And he took it.	Hinan payqa hap'irqan.
Now, I am pretty much.	Kunanqa, yaqa llapanpim kachkani.
You’re really worried, you’re scared.	Chiqamanta llakisqa kachkanki, mancharisqa kanki.
How very great.	Imayna ancha hatun.
There is no house now, he told me.	Kunanqa manañam wasi kanchu, nispas niwarqa.
Then this year.	Chaymanta kay wata.
That’s just like you .	Chayqa qam hinam .
So he says yes to it.	Chaymi payqa arí nispas nin.
A house house.	Huk wasi wasi.
I am happy about that now.	Chaymantam kunanqa kusisqa kachkani.
You want to be a good teacher.	Allin yachachiq kaytam munanki.
I mean to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi niyta munani.
I think this is a good thing.	Kayqa allinpaq kasqanmantam piensani.
The event will take place tomorrow.	Chay ruwayqa paqarinmi kanqa.
Tomorrow is a great day.	Paqarin hatun punchaw.
If anyone can help, that would be great.	Pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa, ancha allinmi kanman.
But he went anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas rirqa.
I want this not to happen.	Kay mana kananta munani.
Everyone is very busy.	Lliwmi ancha ocupasqa kachkanku.
This is a first, he thinks.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi, nispan yuyaykun.
Unfortunately, this is not unique.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa manam sapallanchu.
It seems to be the case.	Chayna kanman hina.
And now he's alone.	Hinaspa kunanqa sapallanmi kachkan.
But something funny happened.	Ichaqa imapas asikunapaq hinam pasarqa.
He was so proud of her that day.	Chay punchawmi paymanta anchata orgulloso kasqa.
No one knows exactly why.	Manam pipas allintachu yachan imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
He desperately needs help.	Payqa anchatan necesitan yanapayta.
You know nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachankichu.
You weren’t really sure about it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaymanta seguro karqanki.
A little bit about it.	Huk chikan chaymanta.
He is very happy to do so.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan chayta ruwananpaq.
Certainly if you do that more often.	Chiqamanta sichus chayta aswan sapa kuti ruwanki chayqa.
He tried to avoid it, but there was nothing he could do.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi mana chayta ruwananpaq, ichaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
This sounds like it.	Kayqa uyarikun.
Like many people.	Askha runakuna hina.
That is not the case at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu.
In fact, there is nothing.	Aswanpas manan imapas kanchu.
You don’t really think about it.	Manan anchatachu chaypi yuyaykunki.
But he can't do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
Nothing like that will happen.	Manam imapas chayna kanqachu.
This continued to be the case.	Kayqa hinallam karqa.
Someone lives there.	Chaypi pipas yachan.
There were people there.	Chaypiqa runakunam karqaku.
Some other person.	Wakin huk runa.
I prefer to do it alone.	Aswan allinmi sapallay ruwayqa.
First of all, everything if it’s better.	Ñawpaqtaqa, tukuy ima sichus aswan allin kanman chayqa.
He did as he did.	Pay hinam ruwarqa.
One of them is bad.	Hukninmi mana allin.
Everyone is sick or tired.	Lliwmi unqusqa utaq sayk’usqa kachkanku.
I don’t think it’s right.	Manam allintachu piensani.
He didn’t want to reason with her anymore.	Payqa manañan paywan yuyaymanayta munarqanchu.
They were great travellers.	Paykunaqa hatun puriq runakunam karqaku.
John is the summer.	Juanqa chay verano.
But it’s a human being.	Ichaqa runam.
I think it’s sort of.	Yuyaykuni huk laya.
I want to go to school.	Yachay wasiman riyta munani.
He’s seriously injured.	Payqa sinchi k’irisqa kashan.
So, two things.	Chaymi, iskay imakuna.
But I think there is something.	Ichaqa piensani imapas kasqanmanta.
I'll make this quick.	Kayta utqaylla ruwasaq.
He wasn’t there.	Manam chaypiqa karqachu.
Sometime in the future maybe, that is.	Hamuq pachapi wakin kuti ichapas, chaymi.
I wasn’t the only one who thought this.	Manam ñuqallachu kayta piensarqani.
This thing is a .	Kay imapas huk .
I was pretty sure of that.	Yaqapaschá chaymanta seguro karqani.
There is no one like that young man.	Chay wayna hinaqa manan pipas kanchu.
That’s a serious thing.	Chayqa huk serio kaqmi.
Okay, he asked me how I was doing.	Allinmi, imayna kasqaykita tapuwarqa.
He wanted this win.	Payqa kay atipayta munarqa.
I really want to work.	Chiqamanta llamk'ayta munani.
One doesn’t have to do what one has to do.	Huk runaqa manan ruwananchu ruwananta.
But now it’s black again.	Ichaqa kunan yapamanta yana.
He seemed very disappointed.	Payqa sinchita hukmanyasqa hinam karqa.
Actually, it was nice.	Chiqaptaqa, sumaqmi karqa.
I am not sure about that now.	Kunanqa manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
Not too bad at all.	Mana ancha mana allinchu ni imapipas.
It’s there but hidden.	Chaypin kashan ichaqa pakasqa.
But he didn’t say it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu nirqan.
You did well there.	Chaypiqa allintam ruwarqanki.
Who knows what he’ll do tonight.	Pitaq yachan kunan tuta imakuna ruwananta.
I know he will, .	Yachanim chayna ruwananta, .
He doesn’t want to be in this school.	Payqa manan munanchu kay escuelapi kayta.
Home in the end.	Wasiman tukukuypi.
That thing has to be huge.	Chay imapas hatunmi kanan.
He knew it would be bad.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kananta.
Folks, there's a lot wrong here.	Runakuna, kaypiqa achka mana allinmi kachkan.
He seemed to live in a big city.	Payqa hatun llaqtapi tiyaq hinam karqa.
It’s almost as if he’s to blame.	Yaqapaschá pay huchayoq kanman hina.
You were always alone here.	Kaypiqa sapa kutim sapallayki karqanki.
Now, you know that.	Kunanqa, chayta yachanki.
How he always planned to do that.	Imaynatachus sapa kuti chayta ruwananpaq yuyaykurqan.
Seriously, it was that easy.	Serio, chayna facilmi karqa.
He was really happy.	Payqa chiqap kusisqam karqa.
You probably did it.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanki.
Strong and cold.	Sinchi hinaspa chiri.
Hopefully it will be a success.	Munaymanmi allin ruway kananpaq.
But things are not as they used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu imapas kashan.
Anything takes time.	Imapas tiempotan necesitan.
Truth had to do it instead.	Cheqaq kayqa ruwanan karqan aswanpas.
I need someone there.	Chaypi pitapas necesitasaq.
I don’t want to do it.	Manam ruwayta munanichu.
Yes, if that’s what you want.	Arí, sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
They have beautiful ideas.	Paykunaqa sumaq yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
That’s what everyone wants.	Chaytan llapa runa munanku.
I would love to see him here, too.	Ñoqapas anchatan munani kaypi payta rikuyta, nispa.
But, yes, there is something.	Ichaqa, arí, imapas kanmi.
Isn’t it yes.	Manachu arí.
You have a reason too.	Qampas imaraykupas kanmi.
What about you? 	Qam ima?
You can’t predict anything.	Manan imatapas willayta atiwaqchu.
I mean this.	Niyta munani kayta.
The time caught.	Chay pacha hap’isqa.
One had to be tough.	Hukninmi sinchi kanan karqan.
Again, this is a last resort.	Yapamanta, kayqa huk qhipa kaq ruwaymi.
I’m really good at that.	Chiqaptam chaypiqa allin kani.
And that’s the bad thing.	Hinaspa chaymi mana allinqa.
He's sure of it.	Payqa chaymanta seguro kachkan.
That someone could be me.	Chay pipas ñuqa kanman nispa.
That’s how good we are.	Chayna allinmi kanchik.
But not quite fast enough.	Ichaqa manan allintachu usqhaylla.
He’s young, handsome, and terribly lonely.	Payqa wayna, sumaq rikchayniyuq, manchay sapallan.
They all look alike.	Llapallankum rikchakun.
That seemed rather interesting.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
It may not be easy.	Manapaschá facilchu kanman.
All of this is fine.	Tukuy kaykunaqa allinmi kachkan.
It made me want to do more with him.	Chaywanmi astawan paywan ruwayta munarqani.
He will drive into town.	Payqa llaqtamanmi carropi rinqa.
Otherwise there is tomorrow.	Mana chayqa paqarinmi kan.
He tried to be polite.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi allinta rimananpaq.
People are short-sighted.	Runakunaqa pisi yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Yes means yes, no means no.	Arí, arí niyta munan, mana niyta munan mana.
She was this beautiful.	Payqa kayna sumaqmi karqa.
He recognized that this was true.	Payqa repararqanmi chay cheqaq kasqanmanta.
Every day I hope tomorrow will be better.	Sapa punchawmi suyachkani paqarin punchaw aswan allin kananta.
Difficult man.	Sasa runa.
I think you always learn the hard way.	Yuyaykuni sapa kuti yachanki sasa ñanta.
But maybe it’s something you want.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas munasqayki kanman.
Yeah well tell me one thing.	Arí allinta willaway hukta.
But here is an important point.	Ichaqa kaypim kachkan huk importante kaq.
The new one is an adult.	Musuq kaq huk hatun runa.
He had been gone for a long time.	Unayñan manaña karqanchu.
They were both mad at me.	Iskayninkum ñuqapaq phiñasqa karqaku.
People have been ready for a long time.	Runakunaqa unayñan listo kashanku.
There is a better way to do it.	Aswan allin ruwayqa kanmi.
That never goes fast enough.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu rin.
I’m glad, actually.	Kusikuni, chiqaptaqa.
He knew, but he didn't care.	Payqa yacharqanmi, ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
A girl came through first.	Huk sipasmi puntata pasarqa.
I can't imagine that.	Chaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atinichu.
I know it means a lot to you.	Yachanim qampaq ancha allin kasqanmanta.
But, you don't know where the real problem is.	Ichaqa, mana yachankichu maypi chiqap sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
He can do that.	Payqa chaynatam ruwanman.
Twice a week before that.	Chaymanta ñawpaqta semanapi iskay kutita.
It’s always hard to learn.	Sapa kutim sasa yachay.
I’m not going right away, you know.	Manam chayllachu risaq, yachanki.
This is a cold one.	Kayqa chiri.
Something? 	Imapas?
I was sure it wasn’t going to work.	Seguro karqani mana allinchu kananmanta.
It was faster than anything out there.	Chay hawapi imamantapas aswan utqayllam karqa.
I can't say for sure why.	Manam seguro niyta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
He doesn’t know this.	Payqa manam kayta yachanchu.
He really got into it today.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kunan p’unchay chayman haykurqan.
I’m not a party guy.	Manam fiestapi kaq runachu kani.
Happy man.	Kusisqa runa.
Being very good.	Ancha allin kaspa.
I mean it’s really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi niyta munani.
But everyone was all sad.	Ichaqa llapallankum llapallanku llakisqa karqaku.
I know how he thinks now.	Yachanim kunan imayna piensasqanmanta.
Some people are very nice.	Wakin runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
He wanted to, yes.	Payqa munarqanmi, arí.
I don’t want to be you.	Manam munanichu qam kayta.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time.	Unayñan qanwan rikuyta munarqani.
Action is the key here.	Kaypiqa ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
This can be very confusing.	Kayqa ancha pantasqa kanman.
But it’s not the worst.	Ichaqa manan aswan mana allinchu.
Then one day.	Chaymanta huk punchaw.
Something simple but good.	Imapas facil ichaqa allin.
Everything is fine there for sure.	Tukuy imapas allinmi chaypi seguro.
And it’s cold there.	Hinaspa chaypiqa chiri kachkan.
But it’s pretty good.	Ichaqa allin allinmi.
It’s not all bad.	Manam tukuy mana allinchu.
This can be difficult.	Kayqa sasa kanman.
He wasn't there yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chaypichu kachkarqa.
I just don’t remember.	Chaylla mana yuyarinichu.
But it is terribly wrong.	Ichaqa manchay pantasqa kashan.
I really wish I could.	Chiqaptam munayman chayta ruwayta.
I thought better of you.	Aswan allintan qanmanta yuyaykurqani.
This is what you did.	Kaytaqa qanmi ruwarqanki.
He couldn't fix it at all.	Payqa manam imapipas allichayta atirqachu.
I can do it all day.	Tukuy punchawmi ruwayta atiyman.
I couldn't talk to anyone about this.	Kaymantaqa manam piwanpas rimayta atirqanichu.
I wanted to be home.	Wasipi kaytam munarqani.
Two years ago it was winter.	Iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi chiri tiempopi karqa.
Every single one of them, is mine.	Sapa sapallanmi chaymanta, ñuqapa.
Here’s the truth.	Kaypi kachkan chiqap kaq.
He knew that was stupid.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayqa sonso kashasqanmanta.
This can be the biggest problem.	Kaymi aswan hatun sasachakuy kanman.
You think you’re strong.	Sinchi kasqaykita yuyaykunki.
For nothing but the past.	Mana imapaqpas, aswanpas ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
He couldn’t see anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.
Obviously, this will not be easy.	Sut’inmi chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kanqa.
He wants to hear that.	Chayta uyariyta munan.
This was the time.	Kaymi chay tiempo karqa.
Nothing good, anyway.	Mana imapas allinchu, imayna kaptinpas.
That’s the only thing.	Chaylla ima.
Instead, he does nothing.	Aswanpas manan imatapas ruwanchu.
He did this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwarqa.
This is here to avoid a big duplicate.	Kayqa kaypi kachkan mana hatun iskay kuti ruwanapaq.
In fact, it probably could have been worse.	Chiqaptaqa ichapas aswan mana allin kanman karqa.
He had to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanan karqa.
There it is, however.	Chaypin ichaqa kashan.
I can’t understand anything.	Manam imatapas entiendeyta atinichu.
Who has no idea what to do with him.	Pichus mana yuyayniyuqchu imata paywan ruwananta.
The second thing is the house.	Iskay kaq kaqmi wasi.
How truly awesome.	Imayna chiqap manchay.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, mana chayqa.
I should be better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanay.
I don’t want to say much about him.	Manam anchatachu paymanta rimayta munani.
Maybe you should have done that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanayki karqa.
I mean, that’s a good thing.	Niyta munani, chayqa allinmi.
So it’s going to be cold.	Chaymi chiri kanqa.
Something happened here.	Kaypiqa imapas pasarqa.
But he is doing it wrong in that regard.	Ichaqa chaypiqa mana allintam ruwachkan.
I couldn't find how to actually do this.	Manam tariyta atirqanichu imaynatam chiqaptapuni kayta ruwayta.
It must be intelligent.	Yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
He could never sit still for long.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas unayta tiyayta atirqanchu.
Maybe he told me.	Ichapas niwarqa.
Maybe it was all a process.	Ichapas tukuy imapas huk ruway karqa.
This is the single most important step.	Kaymi sapallan aswan importante ruway.
Every month here.	Sapa killa kaypi.
I like it that way.	Ñuqaqa chaynatam gustan.
It seems silly, now.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam, kunanqa.
The process was very quick.	Chay ruwayqa ancha utqayllam karqa.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Manam imananpaschu ni imapipas.
I would love to have sex with you.	Munaymanmi qanwan puñuyta.
You want to be him.	Pay kaytam munanki.
This was crazy, but good.	Kayqa loco karqan, ichaqa allinmi.
Everything you’ve ever wanted.	Tukuy ima hayk’aqpas munasqayki.
Quickly, yes.	Utqayllam, arí.
I knew what the problem was.	Yacharqanim ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Which would be wrong.	Imataq mana allinchu kanman.
I am a scientist.	Ñuqaqa yachaysapa runam kani.
I want to catch it again this year.	Kay wata yapamanta hapiyta munani.
So very, very hurt.	Chaymi sinchita, sinchita k’irisqa.
But there is a chance.	Ichaqa kanmi chansa.
He tried to be nice to her.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi paywan allin kananpaq.
This was really a challenge.	Chiqaptam kayqa sasachakuy karqa.
I would have been great there.	Chaypiqa hatunmi kayman karqa.
Surprisingly, they were oversized.	Admirakuypaqmi paykunaqa llumpay hatun karqaku.
I wanted that to happen.	Chaytaqa munarqani.
This is not really good.	Kayqa manam chiqap allinchu.
He didn't really know what he was feeling.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan ima sientekusqanmanta.
I wasn’t like other people.	Manam huk runakuna hinachu karqani.
You don’t think about it like a child.	Manan wawa hinachu chaypi yuyaykunki.
But he knew that this was not the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chay ruwayqa mana hinachu kasqanmanta.
I suspect it won’t happen again this year.	Sospechani manaña kay wata hukmanta pasananta.
We walked to school.	Yachay wasiman puriq kayku.
He is a swimming instructor.	Payqa nadayta yachachiqmi.
I thought he was glad I was there.	Chaypi kasqaymanta kusisqa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I mean he’s young.	Niyta munani payqa wayna kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t act like her anymore.	Payqa manañan pay hinachu ruwan.
She wants out, she wants him.	Payqa lluqsiyta munan, payta munan.
I can’t seem to figure this out.	Kaytaqa manas yuyaymanayta atiymanchu hina.
There is really nothing in it.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas chaypiqa kanchu.
Feature.	Imayna kanan.
That was a new thing to do.	Chayqa karqan mosoq ruwaymi.
But he was nowhere to be found.	Payqa ichaqa manan maypipas karqanchu.
And then one day it doesn't matter anymore.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk punchaw manaña imananpaschu manaña.
You can’t be black.	Mana yana kayta atiwaqchu.
He still wanted to play.	Payqa hinallam pukllayta munarqa.
He would be there one day, but not yet.	Payqa huk punchawmi chaypi kanman karqa, ichaqa manaraqmi.
I just don’t know what to do or say.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imata ruwanayta nitaq imatachus niyta.
He has some very good ideas.	Payqa wakin ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi.
What is the second.	¿Imataq iskay kaq.
It wasn’t me, he said.	Manam ñuqachu karqani, nispa.
I want things to work out.	Munani imapas allin kananpaq.
They would rather not be there at all.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi kanman mana imapipas chaypi kaptinqa.
This is for you.	Kayqa qampaq.
But you can’t stay here.	Ichaqa manan kaypi qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu.
But I’m not quite sure how to go about doing this.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatas kayta ruwanaypaq risaq chayta.
No, well, not alone.	Manan, allinmi, manan sapallanchu.
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Manan pitapas imananpaschu.
Yes, this would be a good thing .	Arí, kayqa allinmi kanman .
Now, that’s crazy.	Kunanqa, chayqa loco.
Everyone wants to look their best.	Lliwmi munanku allin rikchayniyuq kayta.
Not sure what though.	Mana segurochu imamanta ichaqa.
Now I want to play one.	Kunanqa hukta pukllayta munani.
This should be interesting!.	¡Kayqa sumaqmi kanan!.
I was like really worried about it.	Ñuqaqa chaymanta chiqap llakisqa hinam karqani.
He can't work.	Payqa manam llamkayta atinchu.
What he was doing, he had no idea.	Imata ruwaspa, mana ima yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
At first, he didn’t know how to respond.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan yacharqanchu imayna kutichiyta.
You're beautiful, he said.	Sumaqmi kanki, nispa.
He looked a little bigger.	Payqa aswan hatunmi rikchakurqa.
I couldn’t think of anything or take it seriously.	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta atirqanichu nitaq imapaqpas allinpaq hapiyta atirqanichu.
Last time around.	Qhipa kutipi.
Or a headache.	Utaq huk uma.
Why can’t it be easy.	¿Imanasqataq mana facilchu kanman.
And that's what happened.	Hinaspa chaymi chayna pasarqa.
Now I really want to know.	Kunanqa anchatam yachayta munani.
I don't need anything now.	Kunanqa manam imatapas necesitasaqchu.
And that’s not certain now.	Hinaspa chayqa manan kunanqa segurochu.
I would be appalled by that.	Chaywanmi mancharisqa kayman.
He obviously knew what he needed.	Sut’inmi necesitasqanmanta yacharqan.
And how are they doing now?.	Hinaspa, ¿imaynataq kunan kachkanku?.
This is faster.	Kayqa aswan utqayllam.
Accordingly, he was married.	Chayman hinam payqa casarasqa karqa.
You are anything but stupid.	Qamqa imapas kanki ichaqa sonso.
He doesn’t want to hear from me.	Payqa manam ñuqamanta uyariyta munanchu.
He sensed something was going to happen.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas pasananta.
I am a regular married person.	Ñuqaqa sapa kuti casarasqa runam kani.
How does one do this.	Imaynatataq huk runa kayta ruwan.
Both for sure, maybe three.	Iskayninku seguro, ichapas kimsa.
Very late, actually.	Ancha tarde, chiqaptaqa.
But it was not easy at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan facilchu karqan.
I don’t want to, after all.	Manam munanichu, tukuy imamanta.
Very much you.	Anchatam qam.
That’s crazy, though.	Chayqa loco, ichaqa.
What was the problem.	Imataq chay sasachakuy karqa.
He was supposed to be like that.	Payqa chayna kanan karqa.
This happened over and over again.	Kayqa sapa kutim pasarqa.
I feel good about it.	Allinmi chaymantaqa sientekuni.
I can't leave.	Manam ripuyta atiymanchu.
Do not rush this step.	Ama kay llamkayta utqaylla ruwaychu.
It wasn’t like it is today.	Kunan pacha hinaqa manam karqachu.
And he wants to sing.	Hinaspa takiyta munan.
He wanted to win this thing.	Payqa kay imatapas atipayta munarqan.
This is a real, true, important thing.	Kayqa chiqap, chiqap, ancha allin kaqmi.
The worse, the better.	Aswan mana allin kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Why is it that a.	Imaraykutaq huk.
He is always on time.	Payqa sapa kutim tiempollanpi kachkan.
Almost, but no.	Yaqa, ichaqa manan.
So it was no big deal.	Chaymi mana hatun ruwaychu karqa.
Everything is fast.	Tukuy imapas utqayllam kachkan.
You’ll think of this.	Kayta yuyanki.
He was totally uncomfortable.	Payqa tukuy imamanta mana allinchu kasqa.
That meant he was here.	Chayqa kaypi kasqanmantam niyta munarqa.
You know exactly what you want.	Qamqa allintam yachanki ima munasqaykita.
Did you never know.	Manachu haykapipas yacharqankichu.
We are the people of the world.	Kay pachapi runakunam kanchik.
It’s just not there.	Chaylla mana chaypichu.
He still refuses to talk to her.	Kunankamapas manam munanchu paywan rimayta.
Yes, he seemed overwhelmed.	Arí, llumpay llakisqa hinam karqa.
I didn't want to see it anymore.	Manañam astawan qawayta munarqanichu.
Now I was crazy.	Kunanqa loco karqani.
But you don’t want to wait too long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu suyayta munanki.
There is something you have to do.	Kanmi imapas ruwanayki.
I wanted to come here.	Kayman hamuyta munarqani.
He’s kind of.	Payqa huk laya.
Obviously, they weren’t.	Sut’inmi kashan, manan chay hinachu karqanku.
What a stupid man.	Ima sonso runa.
It will never be funny again.	Manañam haykapipas asikunapaq hinachu kanqa.
That was good of me.	Chayqa allinmi karqan ñoqamanta.
Where no one could see him.	Maypichus mana pipas rikuyta atirqachu.
No, there is no time.	Manan, manan tiempo kanchu.
You know, this is a hard day.	Yachanki, kayqa sasa p’unchawmi.
The first person.	Ñawpaq kaq runa.
That’s the thing here.	Chayqa kaypi kaqmi.
But he is alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kashan.
I haven’t heard from you in a long time.	Unayñan mana qanmanta yacharqanichu.
I just didn’t want to know.	Chaylla mana yachayta munarqanichu.
After all, he had no idea.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa mana yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
I don’t want to do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta munanichu.
They’re like, crazy beautiful.	Paykunaqa hina, loco sumaq.
Really, it was nice.	Chiqamanta, sumaq karqa.
But obviously this is not true.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana cheqaqchu.
You are really worried.	Cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kashanki.
But not much else.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu hukmanta.
That’s how I was there.	Chaynatam chaypi karqani.
And this is it.	Hinaspa kayqa.
He has been through so much.	Payqa ancha achkatam pasarqa.
I can’t get away with it.	Manam chaymanta lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
You did a pretty good job.	Allin allintam ruwarqanki.
And then the month, then the next month.	Hinaspa chaymanta killa, chaymanta qhipa killa.
He didn’t think that would happen here.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kaypiqa chhayna kananta.
I think he’s almost happy.	Yuyaykuni yaqa kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
And that would be it.	Hinaspa chaymi kanman.
There is a good and a bad way to do it.	Allin mana allin ruwaymi kan.
That’s the name.	Chay sutin nisqa.
The best thing ever.	Aswan allin kaqmi haykapipas.
I heard it again.	Hukmanta uyarirqani.
There’s nothing more unreal.	Manan imapas aswan mana cheqaqchu kanchu.
So I would like to know about him.	Chaymi paymanta yachayta munanman.
Maybe you can do that.	Ichapas chaynata ruwawaq.
She said she was scared.	Payqa mancharisqa kashasqanmantan nirqan.
But he knows that won’t happen.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay mana pasananta.
That’s the hardest part.	Chayqa aswan sinchi kaqmi.
And how he talks about it.	Hinaspa imaynatataq chaymanta riman chayta.
I know almost nothing.	Yaqa mana imatapas yachanichu.
You learn to shop better.	Aswan allinta rantiyta yachanki.
But then again, it can be beneficial.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, allinpaq kanman.
So don’t overdo it.	Chaymi ama llumpayta ruwaychu.
He seemed almost pleased.	Payqa yaqa kusisqam rikchakurqa.
Not bad, he thinks.	Mana mana allinchu, nispas yuyaykun.
Probably never will.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu.
Nice, but not hugely great.	Sumaq, ichaqa mana hatun hatun.
Talking was better.	Rimayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
All about it, everything about it.	Tukuy chaymanta, tukuy imapas chaymanta.
Great weather.	Hatun pacha.
But then, that’s who I am.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chaymi ñoqaqa kani.

That’s what he told me.	Chaytan niwarqan.
We have a good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kayku.
He certainly should.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ruwanan.
Now you are acting like him.	Kunanqa pay hinam ruwachkanki.
He drank himself to death a week later.	Payqa huk semana qhepamanmi machasqa wañupurqan.
But it's there anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas chaypim kachkan.
He was a drunk man.	Payqa machasqa runam karqa.
It was easy after that.	Chay qhepamanmi facil karqan.
They were quick, sure.	Paykunaqa usqhayllan karqanku, seguro.
He’s not a nobody.	Payqa mana pipas.
Where do you want to sleep?.	¿Maypitaq puñuyta munanki?.
He was beautiful, at least, he was huge.	Payqa sumaqmi karqan, aswanpas, hatun hatunmi karqan.
All right, he seemed to say.	Allinmi, nispas nisqa hina.
The process can take up to three days.	Chay ruwayqa kimsa punchawmi kanman.
That was a week ago.	Chayqa karqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi.
It just does it.	Chayllam ruwan.
He seemed very pleased with it.	Chaywanqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
But, it had to be.	Ichaqa, kanan karqan.
I mean this is crazy.	Kayqa loco niyta munani.
It looked huge.	Hatun hatunmi rikchakurqa.
I couldn't disagree more.	Manam aswan mana acuerdopi kayta atirqanichu.
This means that they are vulnerable.	Kayqa niyta munan, paykunaqa mana allin qhawarisqa kasqankuta.
You knew all along.	Tukuy tiempon yacharqanki.
I need sleep, that’s all.	Puñuyta necesitasaq, chaylla.
It still makes no sense.	Hinallam mana imapaqpas valenchu.
And this one really did.	Hinaspa kayqa chiqaptam ruwarqa.
That’s what it’s all about.	Chaymantam chay tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
It’s just that it’s recent.	Chaylla chayllaraq kasqanmanta.
Or in the past, anyway.	Utaq ñawpaqpi, imayna kaptinpas.
That’s not the case though.	Chayqa manan ichaqa.
You have to take that first step.	Chay ñawpaq kaq ruwaytaqa ruwanayki tiyan.
I'll be great.	Hatunmi kasaq.
He’s alone though.	Payqa sapallanmi ichaqa.
You can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiwaqchu.
It was the best time in the world.	Chayqa karqa kay pachapi aswan allin pacha.
It will be a quick process.	Chayqa usqhaylla ruwaymi kanqa.
Now he says he was wrong.	Kunanqa pantasqa kasqanmantam nin.
This is evident in everything he does.	Chayqa sut’inmi tukuy ima ruwasqanpi.
It’s not too difficult.	Mana ancha sasachu.
The only one, you ever were.	Chay sapallan, hayk’aqllapas karqanki.
So far it’s been a mistake.	Kunankamaqa pantasqa kasqa.
He knew there would be no future here.	Payqa yacharqanmi kaypi mana hamuq tiempo kananta.
Like him, but older.	Pay hina, ichaqa kuraq.
I don’t think he’ll do well there.	Manam chaypi allintachu ruwananta yuyani.
Here they are both again.	Kaypi iskayninku yapamanta kachkanku.
He would love to see her there.	Payqa anchatam munanman chaypi qawayta.
Things seem great after that.	Chay qhepamanmi imapas hatun hina rikch’akun.
He had always wanted it too much.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi llumpayta munarqa.
I love to play the game.	Pukllayta anchata munani.
You want it to be good.	Munanki allin kananta.
This was the darkest part, the hardest part.	Kayqa aswan yana kaqmi karqa, aswan sasa kaqmi karqa.
What a wonderful player.	Ima sumaq pukllaqmi.
He could have done that yesterday.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi ruwanman karqa.
Yes, he is very happy.	Arí, payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
That was yesterday.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi.
That was supposed to be mine.	Chayqa ñuqapa kanan karqa.
He is not alone.	Manan sapallanchu kan.
Being very efficient.	Ancha allin ruwaq kay.
He doesn’t care what happens to him anymore.	Payqa manañan imananpaschu imachus paywan pasasqanmantaqa.
I don’t remember which one though.	Manam yuyarinichu mayqin kaqta ichaqa.
It was nice to spend some time together.	Sumaqmi karqa huk rato kuska kayqa.
And he’s angry.	Hinaspa phiñasqa kachkan.
As an adult, not as a child.	Kuraq runa hina, manan wawa hinachu.
He didn’t have to do it.	Payqa manan ruwananchu karqan.
But now he was angry for some reason.	Kunanmi ichaqa imaraykupas phiñasqa kasqa.
He says later.	Qhepamanmi nin.
That’s very nice of him.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi paymanta.
This has to be yesterday.	Kayqa qayna punchawmi kanan.
That’s stupid fast.	Chayqa sonso utqaylla.
Maybe it almost was.	Ichapas yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
It wasn’t the right fit.	Manam chayman hinachu karqa.
I wanted to be with him.	Paywan kuska kaytam munarqani.
He was, for sure.	Payqa karqan, seguro.
That's pretty safe for me.	Chayqa sumaq segurom ñuqapaq.
I'll go more often.	Aswan sapa kutim risaq.
Then he can do whatever he wants.	Chaymantaqa munasqanman hinam ruwayta atinman.
But he didn’t notice anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas repararqanchu.
So, this is what happened.	Chaymi, kayna pasarqa.
I was the only one there.	Chaypiqa ñuqallam karqani.
Nowhere, not here.	Mana maypipas, mana kaypichu.
No one knew how to help.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imayna yanapayta.
It was the size of a baseball.	Chayqa karqan huk béisbol hina hatunmi.
I don’t want to either.	Manam ñuqapas munanichu.
I have no idea why or how he does this.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku nitaq imaynatataq kayta ruwan.
Or, it should be.	Utaq, chayna kanan.
He was very good to her.	Payqa ancha allintam paywan ruwarqa.
No one wanted to take the chance.	Manan pipas chay oportunidadta hap’iyta munarqanchu.
It will probably be a while.	Yaqapaschá huk rato kanqa.
Not yet, however.	Manaraqmi ichaqa.
I had to do a lot of things.	Achkatam imatapas ruwanay karqa.
It's almost too good to be true.	Yaqa ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq.
He always did that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayta ruwaq.
I feel better here.	Aswan allintam kaypi kachkani.
Really absurd.	Chiqap mana yuyayniyuq.
That was now.	Chayqa kunanmi karqan.
I’m glad he’s not here.	Kusikuni mana kaypi kasqanmanta.
No one could do everything perfectly.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Maybe he’s the one.	Ichapas payqa chayna kanman.
He is very pathetic.	Payqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
He knew how to do it right.	Payqa yacharqanmi allinta ruwayta.
She is a good girl	Allin sipasmi kan .
I’m not the same person anymore.	Manañam chay kikin runachu kani.
That’s not too difficult.	Chayqa ancha sasachu.
We are not human beings.	Manam runachu kanchik.
It has never been the same.	Manam haykapipas huk hinaqa karqachu.
Next year maybe.	Hamuq wata ichapas.
Yeah, that’s nice.	Arí, chayqa sumaqmi.
Almost like that.	Yaqa chayna.
I think he is a great teacher.	Payqa ancha allin yachachiq kasqanmantam piensani.
And that would be fine, but fine.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi kanman, ichaqa allinmi.
Couldn't say the word.	Mana chay simita niyta atirqachu.
He is usually very happy.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim ancha kusisqa kachkan.
And that’s what happened to us.	Hinaspa chaymi ñuqaykuwan pasarqa.
It looked so bad.	Ancha mana allinmi rikchakurqa.
I don’t have time to do everything.	Manam tiempoy kanchu tukuyta ruwanaypaq.
Now he went on and on.	Kunanqa payqa hinallam rirqa.
So, there could be three.	Chaymi, kimsa kanman.
Can’t help with that.	Mana chaypi yanapayta atinchu.
I doubt it will happen.	Iskayrayani chayna kananta.
They’re not as, well, happy as they used to be.	Paykunaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu, allinmi, kusisqa hinachu kanku.
I think he wants to be home.	Yuyaykuni wasinpi kayta munasqanmanta.
I don’t really know if it’s for me.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani ñuqapaq kasqanmantaqa.
You’re fine now, he says.	Kunanqa allinmi kanki, nispas nin.
I am very concerned about that.	Chaywanmi anchata llakikuni.
And you were terrified.	Hinaspa mancharisqa karqanki.
The more the better today.	Aswan achka kaptinqa kunan punchawmi aswan allin.

Don’t pretend it’s not true.	Ama mana chiqap kaqta hina ruwaychu.
He never really says anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu imatapas nin.
That’s why he did it.	Chayraykum payqa chayta ruwarqa.

This night I was as safe as anywhere.	Kay tutaqa maypipas hinam seguro karqani.
Like all night long.	Tukuy tuta hina.
Maybe there’s something else there.	Ichapas chaypi huk imapas kanman.
It is important to tell the truth.	Cheqaq kaqta rimayqa ancha allinmi.
They are not that good.	Paykunaqa manam chayna allinchu kanku.
She was eager to say yes.	Payqa anchatan munarqan arí niyta.
It made more money.	Aswan qullqita ruwarqa.
Everything is better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinmi.
I enjoy talking to him.	Paywan rimayqa anchatam kusikuni.
I was stupid enough.	Ñuqaqa sonso karqani.
But he didn’t stay there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu qhepakurqan.
You can do something else with it.	Chaywanmi huk ruwaytapas ruwawaq.
But that's the point here.	Ichaqa chaymi kaypi kachkan.
In fact, it was more every day.	Chiqaptaqa sapa punchawmi aswan achka karqa.
And that’s not untrue this summer.	Hinaspa chayqa manan mana cheqaqchu kay verano.
Not much here, either.	Mana ancha kaypi, nitaq.
It was a very difficult task.	Ancha sasa ruwaymi karqa.
And that’s the guy.	Hinaspa chay wayna.
Tell him he has to go.	Rinan kasqanmanta niy.
You are so much like me.	Anchatam ñuqa hina kanki.
It was about thirty.	Yaqa chunka kimsa chunka kasqa.
He does this a lot.	Payqa anchatam kayta ruwan.
Hopefully there isn’t.	Munaymanmi mana kanchu.
The stranger was me.	Chay mana riqsisqa runaqa ñuqam karqani.
This isn’t really a secret.	Kayqa manan cheqaqtachu pakasqa.
There is a senselessness.	Mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kachkan.
I like it more all the time.	Tukuy tiempon astawan gustan.
Maybe there will be another time.	Ichapas huk kutipi kanqa.
Something more human-like.	Imapas aswan runa hina.
Soon enough, he did.	Pisi tiempollamantan chayta ruwarqan.
Don't be overly anxious.	Ama llumpay llakisqa kaychu.
You don’t quite know how to do that.	Mana allintachu yachanki imaynatachus chayta ruwanki chayta.
If that fails, he .	Chay mana allin kaptinqa, payqa .
This is not so easy though.	Kayqa manan chay hina facilchu ichaqa.
I had a party.	Huk fiestata ruwarqani.
That day is not today.	Chay punchawqa manam kunan punchawchu.
And then a little scared.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk chikan mancharisqa.
That's actually been going on for a long time.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa unayñam kachkan.
This came out of everything.	Kayqa tukuy imamanta lluqsirqa.
He couldn’t believe how hungry he was.	Manas creeyta atirqachu imayna yarqaymanta kasqanta.
It wasn’t true.	Mana cheqaqchu karqan.
I know he could say something else.	Yachanim hukta rimayta atisqanmanta.
This is a .	Kayqa huk .
So that’s what happened with it.	Chaymi chaywanqa pasarqa.
You probably know that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachanki.
I am so glad he did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Do it for the better.	Allinpaq ruway.
He wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu karqan.
That, however, no longer seems to be the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manañan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
You know, it depends.	Yachanki, chaymantam kanqa.
But no one knows what happened this time.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu kay kutipi imachus pasasqanmanta.
It seems no less true today.	Kunan tiempopiqa manan pisi cheqaqchu rikch’akun.
I couldn’t get over how good it was.	Manam atipayta atirqanichu imayna allin kasqanmantaqa.
He was just like a crazy person.	Payqa loco runa hinallam karqa.
But no one could do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
He can’t do anything.	Manan imapipas ruwayta atinmanchu.
Me, in fact.	Ñuqa, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe this is all wrong.	Ichapas kayqa llapan pantasqa kachkan.
Without it, he does nothing.	Mana kaptinqa manam imatapas ruwanchu.
That’s not true now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa cheqaqchu.
So it was just that.	Chaymi chaylla karqa.
But you can’t do everything.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I have a good idea who it might be.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kani pichus kanman chayta.
And that night was terrible, terrible.	Hinaspa chay tutaqa manchay, manchay kasqa.
It will be safer.	Aswan seguro kanqa.
I want to do this, for sure.	Kayta ruwayta munani, chiqamanta.
I did the same thing.	Ñuqaqa chaynatam ruwarqani.
He knew, he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, payqa yacharqanmi.
But there you were.	Ichaqa chaypim karqanki.
Now it’s not good.	Kunanqa mana allin.
He was no longer that kind of person.	Payqa manañam chayna runachu karqa.
This makes less sense.	Kayqa aswan pisi yuyayniyuqmi.
I want to be richer.	Aswan qhapaq kaytam munani.
That’s why we did it.	Chayraykum chayta ruwarqayku.
He looked like anyone.	Payqa pimanpas rikchakurqa.
In fact, most of the summer was cold and wet.	Aswanpas yaqa llapan chiri killapin chiri, chiri ima karqan.
Here, however,	Kaypiqa ichaqa .
You did that, no one else.	Chaytaqa qanmi ruwarqanki, manan pipas.
He never did that.	Manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
Anything, everything, nothing.	Imapas, tukuy ima, mana ima.
This was, all right.	Kayqa karqan, allinmi.
There may have been no alternative.	Chaypaqqa manapaschá huk ruwayqa karqanchu.
There’s nothing wrong with it, really.	Manam imapas mana allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
Each person is a mystery.	Sapa runam huk pakasqa yachay.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu karqan.
Everyone knows that.	Chaytan llapa runa yachanku.
He’s the one I have to be.	Paymi kanay.
But he’s really smart.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin yachaysapa.
He told me what it was.	Paymi niwarqa ima kasqanmanta.
So many of them.	Chaymi achka.
I thought it would be quick.	Utqaylla kananta yuyaykurqani.
You have to do it right now.	Kunanmi allinta ruwanayki.
I mean, crazy.	Niyta munani, loco.
But it doesn't seem very nice.	Ichaqa manan ancha sumaq hinachu.
I can’t help it now.	Mana kunan yanapayta atiymanchu.
We can never talk again.	Manam haykapipas yapamanta rimayta atichwanchu.
I want to buy a car soon.	Usqhaylla carrota rantiyta munani.
That’s not always the case anymore.	Manañan sapa kutichu chhayna kan.
Not doing that is downright crazy.	Chayta mana ruwayqa chiqap loco kaymi.
That’s the only real thing to do.	Chayllam chiqap ruwayqa.
He knows better than anyone else.	Paymi aswan allinta yachan.
Anyway, here is what happened.	Imayna kaptinpas, kaypim kachkan imakuna pasasqanmanta.
But there is so much to do.	Ichaqa ancha achka ruwana.
That’s me though.	Chayqa ñuqam ichaqa.
He couldn’t be friendlier.	Payqa manan aswan amigontin kayta atirqanchu.
This one seemed unhappy.	Kayqa mana kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
If you don’t, you will be fired.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa qarqosqa kanki.
Wrong, all wrong.	Pantasqa, tukuy mana allin.
Yeah, that’s the problem.	Arí, chay sasachakuy.
How long I lost track of.	Hayk’a tiempon chaytaqa manaña yacharqanichu.
He wouldn't mean it.	Payqa manan chayta niyta munanmanchu.
Therefore, they disagree.	Chayraykum mana acuerdopi kachkanku.
Get it right the first time.	Ñawpaq kutipi allinta ruway.
Indeed, he is ready by now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunankamaqa listoña kashan.
But I think you agree with me.	Ichaqa ñoqawan acuerdopi kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
At least he knew, she thought.	Yaqapaschá payqa yacharqan, nispan yuyaykurqan.
Being a good person.	Allin runa kay.
Nothing there now.	Mana imapas chaypi kunanqa.
That doesn’t mean this is easy.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu kayqa facil kasqanmanta.
But he didn't want to say anything bad.	Ichaqa manan mana allin rimayta munarqanchu.
I know out there somewhere.	Yachanim chay hawapi maypipas.
I feel so great too.	Ñuqapas ancha hatunmi sientekuni.
I thought the same as you.	Ñoqapas qan hinan yuyaykurqani.
He was sad and worried.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
If this is true.	Kay chiqap kaptinqa.
But you were here before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kaypi karqanki.
Now I knew it.	Kunanqa yacharqanim.
All right, all right, he said.	Allinmi, allinmi, nispa.
Too lonely or something.	Llumpay sapallan utaq imapas.
He wanted to speak but couldn't say anything.	Rimayta munarqa ichaqa manam imatapas niyta atirqachu.
So it’s not.	Chaymi manaña.
I did that, yes.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, arí.
He says that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim nin.
Did you know about it?.	¿Chaymanta yacharqankichu?.
But it can’t be this.	Ichaqa manan kayta atinmanchu.
He is mine now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqapa.
Next month more.	Hamuq killa aswan achka.
Today is a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allinmi.
This makes more sense.	Kayqa aswan yuyayniyuqmi.
Not the second.	Mana iskay kaq.
He wants her.	Payta munan.
He was very hungry.	Payqa ancha yarqasqa kasqa.
You probably know the truth.	Yaqapaschá allinta yachanki cheqaq kaqta.
This seemed like it would work.	Kayqa allin kanman hinam rikchakurqa.
And then, there it is.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chaypi kachkan.
Does anyone know what that means?.	¿Pipas yachanchu chay niyta munan?.
So there it is, yeah.	Chaymi chaypiqa kachkan, arí.
I didn’t mean it now.	Manam kunanqa niyta munarqanichu.
Not always, but most of the time.	Mana sapa kutichu, aswanpas aswan achka kutipi.
No good practice anywhere.	Mana maypipas allin ruway.
That’s what I had to do first.	Chaytan ñawpaqtaqa ruwanay karqan.
It’s more interesting that way.	Aswan sumaqmi chayna.
Maybe you’re a newbie.	Ichapas huk musuq kaq kanki.
About everything now.	Tukuy imamanta kunan.
It’s been working like that for a long time.	Unayñan chay hinata llank’ashan.
He always failed.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwaq.
There are .	Kan .
You are an adult.	Qamqa kuraq runam kanki.
I want to come.	Hamuyta munani.
They are all bad.	Llapallankum mana allin kanku.
I have to be here.	Kaypim kanay.
I don’t remember it anymore.	Manañam yuyarinichu.
It sure will be good to be home.	Seguro allinmi kanqa wasipi kayqa.
He seemed very serious.	Payqa ancha serio hinan kasharqan.
It was easy, very easy.	Chayqa facilmi karqa, ancha facilmi karqa.
I don't agree with you.	Ñuqaqa manam acuerdopichu kani.
Now tell me what to do tonight.	Kunanqa willaway imatataq kay tuta ruwanaypaq.
Three great people.	Kimsa hatun runakuna.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam karqa.
Nothing came easy.	Manam imapas facilchu hamurqa.
But he refuses to talk to her.	Ichaqa manan munanchu paywan rimayta.
This is not the first time I have done this.	Kayqa manam ñawpaq kutichu kayta ruwani.
More, you know.	Astawan, yachanki.
He couldn’t get there alone.	Payqa manan sapallan chayayta atirqanchu.
I think this is all good.	Kayqa tukuy allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
If it’s not right, it’s stupid.	Mana allinchu kaptinqa sonso.
And he makes a great play.	Hinaspa hatun pukllayta ruwan.
The worse was the better.	Aswan mana allinqa aswan allinmi karqan.
And he was gone.	Hinaspa manaña karqanchu.
But they weren’t quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu karqanku.
Once, he told me he wasn't there.	Huk kuti, niwarqa mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
It says who he is.	Chayqa pi kasqanmantam nin.
Of course, it’s a must.	Chiqamanta, chayqa ruwana tiyan.
I thought, well, you want to know.	Yuyarqanim, allinmi, yachayta munanki.
But it is the best thing today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopi aswan allin kaqmi.
Let’s hope that’s the case.	Suyasun chayna kasqanmanta.
Probably did such a good job.	Yaqapaschá chayna allin llamkayta ruwarqa.
It was probably too big.	Yaqapaschá sinchi hatun karqan.
We must act accordingly.	Chayman hinam ruwananchik.
It was a tough time to be sure.	Chayqa sinchi sasa tiempon karqan seguro kanaypaq.
He's really into it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi kachkan.
That wouldn’t be right at all.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman ni imapipas.
That sounds true.	Chayqa chiqap hinam uyarikun.
I want to go to a restaurant.	Huk mikhuy wasiman riyta munani.
If you disagree, that’s fine.	Mana acuerdopichu kanki chayqa, allinmi.
If he doesn't, someone else can.	Mana ruwaptinqa huk runam ruwanman.
Maybe it was worse.	Ichapas aswan mana allin karqa.
He never was before.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa karqanchu.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam llumpay allinchu karqa.
I heard something.	Imatapas uyarirqanim.
This seemed bad, bad, bad.	Kayqa mana allin, mana allin, mana allin hinam karqa.
They become fast friends.	Paykunaqa usqhayllan amigontin kanku.
Almost always.	Yaqa sapa kutim.
You think he’d know better.	Aswan allinta yachananta yuyanki.
That is why it is hidden.	Chayraykum pakasqa kachkan.
So, that's	Chaymi, chayta .
He knew this was not so.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa mana chhayna kasqanmanta.
That’s going to happen.	Chay pasananta.
He had so much going for him.	Payqa ancha achkatam paypaq rirqa.
He declined to say how much.	Payqa manan hayk’a kasqanmanta willayta munarqanchu.
Please don’t do anything.	Ama hina kaspa, ama imatapas ruwaychu.
No one is really sure why.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa segurochu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I think this will happen all the time.	Kay tukuy tiempo pasananta yuyaykuni.
We’re not good enough.	Mana allinchu kayku.
She was terrified of him.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa paymanta.
Hard to say though.	Sasa niyta ichaqa.
Please don’t make this movie.	Ama hina kaspa, ama kay peliculata ruwaychu.
But they are secondary.	Ichaqa iskay kaqmi kanku.
Yes, a wonderful world.	Arí, huk sumaq pacha.
But now was truly a better time.	Ichaqa kunanqa cheqaqtapunin aswan allin tiempo karqan.
Hopefully it never happens.	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas chayna kananta.
I mean, important people.	Niyta munani, importante runakuna.
Yes, it has been around for a long time.	Arí, unayñam kachkan.
Whatever it is here.	Ima kaypi kaptinpas.
Nowadays, it seems like pretty much everything is about me.	Kunan tiempopiqa yaqa tukuy imapas ñuqamanta hinam kachkan.
Unfortunately this type no longer exists.	Llakikuypaqmi kay laya manaña kanchu.
But he told me to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
He was worried now.	Payqa kunanmi llakisqa kasqa.
I want to see what that looks like.	Chay imayna kasqanmantam qawayta munani.
The man is still there.	Chay runaqa hinallam kachkan.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Payqa ñawpaq hina sumaqmi.
I was as excited as he was.	Ñuqapas pay hinam kusisqa tarikurqani.
He knows you can do it.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
So, everything is good here.	Chaymi, kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
So that’s my thing.	Chaymi chaymi ñuqapa kaq.
I can’t figure that out.	Mana chayta yuyaymanayta atinichu.
I hope he's not married.	Suyachkani mana casarasqa kasqanmanta.
The more you do the more you learn.	Astawan ruwanki astawan yachanki.
He didn't know what all.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima llapan.
But that’s a pretty big deal.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha hatunmi.
We are happy here.	Kaypiqa kusisqam kachkaniku.
So they want him right.	Chaymi allinta payta munanku.
I do that every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaynata ruwani.
He knows he can’t do it.	Payqa yachanmi mana ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi kachkan.
He said he was great and beautiful.	Payqa hatun sumaqmi nispas nisqa.
I know for a fact.	Chiqaptam yachani.
There was no reason he should have been there.	Manam imaraykupas chaypi kanan karqachu.
He was actually fine with it.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allinmi karqa chaywanqa.
No way, it’s not good.	Mana imayna, mana allinchu.
Tired, tired.	Sayk'usqa, sayk'usqa.
That would be a mistake.	Chayqa pantasqa kanman.
He says he can’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu nin.
Of course, he doesn’t.	Chiqamanta, payqa mana.
You have no idea whatsoever.	Mana ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
I know you want more from me.	Yachanim aswan imatapas ñuqamanta munasqaykita.
This was all very simple.	Kayqa tukuy imapas ancha facilmi karqa.
Everyone knows who will win.	Lliwmi yachanku pikuna atipananta.
It should have been done right.	Allintam ruwana kanman karqa.
Yes, it was devastating.	Arí, sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He meant this to be a little rude.	Payqa kaytan niyta munarqan huk chhikanta mana allin rimananpaq.
This will be a very difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi kanqa.
You just get drunk every day.	Sapa punchawmi chayllaraq machasqa kanki.
No one could say anything.	Manam pipas imatapas niyta atirqachu.
And this one was good.	Hinaspa kay huknin allin kasqa.
Yes, and thank you.	Arí, hinaspa gracias.
Tell me about it tonight.	Kunan tuta chaymanta willaway.
I thought there was more, maybe.	Yuyarqanim aswan achka kasqanmanta, ichapas.
Good for you!.	¡Allinmi qanpaq!.
But there is a third possibility.	Ichaqa kinsa kaq ruwaymi kanman.
But really, you’ll find out very quickly.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapuni, ancha usqhayllan yachanki.
It’s hard for me.	Sasa ñuqapaq.
And he was terrified.	Hinan payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
And him always.	Hinaspa payta sapa kuti.
This was not an easy crowd.	Kayqa manam facilchu achka runakuna karqa.
Only you know these things.	Chaykunataqa qamllam yachanki.
And it was great.	Hinaspa hatun kasqa.
That does it for me.	Chayqa ñuqapaq ruwan.
He was never a very good man.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha allin runachu karqan.
The best thing to do is to be there.	Aswan allinqa chaypi kaymi.
Herein lies the evil.	Kaypim mana allinqa kachkan.
But now it was not to be.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
Yes, he knows a lot about this.	Arí, payqa anchatam kaymanta yachan.
I feel very proud of that.	Chaymantam anchata orgulloso tarikuni.
It’s a beautiful thing to do.	Sumaq ruwaymi.
And then he seemed very sad.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa ancha llakisqa hinam karqa.
But he knew he didn't.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwarqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
He really looked at her.	Chiqamanta payta qhawarisqa.
Less than that is good.	Aswan pisi chaymanta allin.
They are very nice though.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi ichaqa.
But the worst still happened.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinqa hinallam pasarqa.
He refused to believe it.	Mana creeyta munarqanchu.
But they are not there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu kanku.
People were the same thing.	Runakunaqa chay kaqmi karqanku.
Nothing was right.	Manan imapas allinchu karqan.
I think of him as a bad person.	Mana allin runa hinam piensani.
That’s all, it’s .	Chaylla, chayqa .
I can go away.	Ripuyta atiyman.
No one could find a job.	Manam pipas llamkayta tariyta atirqachu.
It makes no sense, otherwise.	Manam imapaqpas valenchu, mana chayqa.
Two truths, in fact.	Iskay chiqap, chiqaptaqa.
It wasn’t there before, but now it is.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaypichu karqan, kunanmi ichaqa kashan.
That was a no.	Chayqa karqa mana.
I wonder who that could be.	Tapukuni pitaq chay kanman chayta.
I really don't think this is true.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayqa chiqap kananpaqchu piensani.
Some things may not make sense.	Wakin imakuna mana yuyayniyuqchu kanman.
As good as it is.	Allin hina.
Who couldn’t help that?.	¿Pitaq mana chayta yanapayta atirqachu?.
I regret that now.	Chaymantaqa kunanmi llakikuni.
They want immediate success.	Paykunaqa chaylla allintam munanku.
That’s how he knew it.	Chaynatam payqa yacharqa.
Now he felt foolish.	Kunanqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam tarikurqa.
Maybe it’s the world.	Ichapas kay pacha kanman.
He didn’t do it.	Mana ruwarqanchu.
Neither did I.	Nitaq ñuqapas.
Everything else is secondary to that.	Tukuy imapas chaymanta iskay kaqmi.
But that is not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
But, thank you.	Ichaqa, gracias.
But it’s not always bad or bad.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu mana allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
Now it’s great.	Kunanqa hatunmi kachkan.
Not sure what the real problem is.	Mana segurochu ima chiqap sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
If so, it is wrong.	Chayna kaptinqa pantasqa.
But otherwise he’s doing fine.	Ichaqa mana chayqa allintan ruwashan.
That must be tough.	Chayqa sinchi kanan.
A lot of people know about me.	Ancha achka runakunam ñuqamanta yachanku.
So it’s not like me.	Chaymi mana ñuqa hinachu.
I really wanted to help him.	Sinchitan payta yanapayta munarqani.
There he spoke.	Chaypin rimarqan.
I have certainly heard of him.	Cheqaqtapunin paymanta uyarirqani.
I am not the best.	Ñoqaqa manam aswan allinchu.
Some people were really passive.	Wakin runakunaqa cheqaqtapunin mana imatapas ruwaq karqanku.
It was good to be busy.	Allinmi karqa ocupasqa kayqa.
But that’s not all it does.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu chaytaqa ruwan.
This may not be your case.	Kayqa manapaschá qanpa hinachu kanman.
You are the worst.	Aswan mana allin kaqmi kanki.
But he couldn’t see it.	Ichaqa manan rikuyta atirqanchu.
I still feel like a newlywed.	Kunankamapas chayllaraq casarasqa hinam tarikuni.
I mean talk to him.	Paywan rimayta niyta munani.
It is completely useless.	Tukuy imapipas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
I’ve never seen that before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa rikurqanichu ñawpaqtaqa.
And happy people.	Hinaspa kusisqa runakuna.
You’re half hungry.	Kuskan yarqaymanta kanki.
But it’s not a new practice.	Ichaqa manan mosoq ruwaychu.
I’m not here or there, where I’m supposed to be.	Manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu kani, maypitaq kanay.
But now he knew what he wanted to do today.	Ichaqa kunanmi yacharqa kunan punchaw ima ruway munasqanmanta.
Unfortunately this did not always happen.	Llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana sapa kutichu pasarqa.
But he knew he couldn’t do it fast enough.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana usqhaylla ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I have to be mindful.	Ñuqaqa yuyayniyuqmi kanay.
I was always sure.	Sapa kutim seguro karqani.
But everyone agrees that this needs to be done.	Ichaqa llapallankum acuerdopi kachkanku kayqa ruwana kasqanmanta.
This is still the case today.	Kayqa kunankamapas hinam kachkan.
Now I need an answer.	Kunanqa kutichiyta necesitasaq.
You can’t really say anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas niyta atiwaqchu.
It’s a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruwaymi.
But he could never get them.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaykunataqa hap’iyta atirqanchu.
But he never stayed long.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas unaytachu qhepakurqan.
No one said anything for a long time.	Unayñan mana pipas imatapas nirqanchu.
I’m afraid it’s too cold.	Manchakuni ancha chiri kasqanmanta.
Maybe he knows something better.	Ichapas payqa imatapas astawan yachan.
He told her not to drive.	Payqa nirqam ama carrota manejananpaq.
I am here to make this right.	Kayta allinta ruwanaypaqmi kaypi kachkani.
Here’s the good, here’s the bad.	Kaypi allin, kaypi mana allin.
As always, you did a great job.	Sapa kuti hinam hatun llamkayta ruwarqanki.
It may be hidden somewhere.	Yaqapaschá maypipas pakasqa kanman.
You want to avoid that.	Chayta mana ruwayta munanki.
I don’t want those things.	Manam chaykunataqa munanichu.
It just didn’t go together.	Chaylla mana kuskachu rirqa.
First, he did what was right.	Ñawpaqtaqa, allinpaq kaqta ruwarqa.
That’s never a bad thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allinchu.
Anyway, there is something else.	Imayna kaptinpas, huk imapas kanmi.
Speaking wasn't bad.	Rimayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
He did that with some success.	Chaytaqa wakin allintam ruwarqa.
I would be very unsure.	Ñuqaqa ancha mana segurochu kayman.
But it really goes there.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayman rin.
There is no food.	Mana mikhuy kanchu.
There is something to be done.	Chaypaqqa imatapas ruwana.
I'm not happy about it either.	Ñuqapas manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu kani.
But there is no such thing.	Ichaqa manan kanchu chay hina ruwaq.
That's the only good thing about it.	Chayllam allinqa chaymantaqa.
But it was extremely unrealistic.	Ichaqa sinchi mana cheqaqchu karqan.
Why do you do it all the time.	Imaraykutaq sapa kuti ruwanki.
I'll do that tomorrow.	Chaytaqa paqarinmi ruwasaq.
Can't find a job.	Mana llamkayta tariyta atinchu.
He didn't know why, but he knew.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
In fact, it is the man.	Chiqaptaqa chay runam.
It won’t be easy with me.	Ñoqawanqa manan facilchu kanqa.
That was a very bad thing to do.	Chayqa sinchi mana allin ruwaymi karqan.
I’ve thought about this for a long time.	Unayñan kaypi yuyaykurqani.
It’s still the best.	Kunankamapas aswan allinmi.
This is an insurance policy.	Kayqa seguro nisqa.
To do what is right with him.	Paywan allin kaqta ruwananpaq.
And what would he do about it.	Hinaspa imatataq chaymanta ruwanman karqan.
It was such a fresh morning.	Chayna musuq paqarinmi karqa.
It sure is beautiful.	Seguro sumaqmi.
He was always on time.	Payqa sapa kutim tiempollanpi karqa.
You learn very quickly.	Ancha utqayllam yachanki.
If it were true.	Sichus cheqaq kanman chayqa.
She was the second girl.	Payqa iskay kaq sipasmi karqan.
I make the time.	Tiempota ruwani.
It didn’t happen alone.	Manam sapallanchu pasarqa.
I couldn't remember where and when.	Manam yuyariyta atirqanichu maypi hinaspa haykapi.
The process of doing so is very simple.	Chayta ruwanapaq ruwayqa ancha facilmi.
Everything is very difficult.	Tukuy imapas ancha sasa.
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa karqan hinan.
It certainly can be.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina kanman.
Two weeks later, he couldn’t do it anymore.	Iskay semana qhepamanmi manaña chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He looked as surprised as she was.	Payqa pay hina admirasqa rikchakurqa.
But now something matters.	Ichaqa kunanmi imapas importante.
People in the late night restaurant.	Tutamanta mikhuy wasipi runakuna.
Why do you want to do that?.	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwayta munanki?.
Fortunately no one cares.	Ancha kusisqa manam pipas imananpaschu.
I was never like him.	Manam haykapipas pay hinachu karqani.
And it would be black.	Hinaspa yana kanman.
And that’s just ridiculous.	Hinaspa chayqa asikunapaq hinallam.
Yes, those people are here.	Arí, chay runakunaqa kaypim kachkan.
He wants to tell you everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam willayta munan.
But then he probably talked to her all day.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa yaqapaschá tukuy p’unchay paywan rimaq.
Now, a man.	Kunanqa, huk runa.
A bad boy like you.	Qan hina millay wayna.
I wanted to know about him.	Paymanta yachayta munarqani.
What’s so hard about that?.	¿Imataq chaymanta ancha sasa?.
It’s harder this time, harder.	Aswan sasa kay kutipi, aswan sinchi.
He knows what’s at stake.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna sasachakuypi kashasqanmanta.
Not here, not there.	Mana kaypichu, mana chaypichu.
Obviously he couldn’t.	Sut’inmi mana atirqanchu.
But there is a better way.	Ichaqa kanmi aswan allin ruway.
That is a difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa sasa ruwaymi.
Not good, that.	Mana allinchu, chay.
That may not always be the case.	Chayqa manapaschá sapa kutichu kanman.
If you don’t plan well, you plan to fail.	Mana allintachu yuyaykunki chayqa, mana allinta ruwanaykipaqmi yuyaykunki.
I never really thought much about it until recently.	Manam haykapipas anchatachu chaypiqa piensarqani chayllaraq.
I know it’s going to be tough.	Yachanim sinchi kananta.
Yes, he was a great man.	Arí, payqa hatun runam karqa.
If you’re not happy, tell me why.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, willaway imarayku.
I’ve never had one.	Ñuqaqa mana hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
It happened about ten times.	Chunka hinam pasarqa.
He obviously hasn’t done it before.	Payqa sut’inmi mana ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanchu.
That’s what he never does.	Chaytan mana hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
He was a huge giant.	Payqa hatun hatunmi karqa.
They were all furious.	Llapallankum phiñasqa karqaku.
If you don’t, you’ll get hurt.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, k’irisqa kanki.
To do something that no one else has done as well as before.	Imatapas mana pipas ñawpaqpi hina allinta ruwasqanta ruwanapaq.
I’m all over the place.	Tukuy chaypim kachkani.
But it wasn’t enough to get him fired.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan qarqosqa kananpaq.
This is not a bad thing, actually.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
That is, they know about him.	Chayqa, paymanta yachanku.
More not just that.	Aswan mana chayllachu.
Maybe you’d like to join us.	Ichapas qampas ñuqaykuwan kuska kayta munanki.
But not very often.	Ichaqa manan ancha sapa kutichu.
He couldn’t work in the real world.	Payqa manan cheqaq pachapi llank’ayta atirqanchu.
I have to do that first.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanay.
Fortunately, there is someone.	Ancha kusisqa, pipas kanmi.
I thought she looked beautiful.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
So that’s what happened.	Chaymi chay pasarqa.
It was the last day of college.	Colegiopi qhepa p’unchaymi karqan.
No one here knows who he is.	Kaypiqa manam pipas yachanchu pi kasqanmantaqa.
He was pathetic, at least.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi karqa, aswanpas.
But he wanted to leave.	Ichaqa ripuyta munarqa.
Then one last thing.	Chaymanta huk qhipa kaq.
That is, he did it.	Chayqa, paymi chayta ruwarqan.
That statement is nowhere to be found.	Chay nisqanqa manan maypipas kanchu.
But he kept going anyway.	Ichaqa imayna kaptinpas hinallam rirqa.
Here's why it didn't make sense.	Kaypi imarayku mana yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
But you never know.	Ichaqa manan hayk'aqpas yachankichu.
Before that, maybe.	Manaraq chaymanta, ichapas.
It's always quick.	Sapa kutim utqaylla.
That was not meant to be.	Chayqa manam chayna kananpaqchu karqa.
Yeah, yeah, that would be better.	Arí, arí, chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I can make a word here, a sentence there.	Kaypiqa huk simita, chaypi huk rimayta ruwayman.
We are hidden here.	Kaypi pakasqa kachkaniku.
He’s not very childlike.	Payqa mana ancha wawa hinachu.
But that’s what he wanted to know.	Ichaqa chaytan yachayta munarqan.
I just did it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas chayllam ruwarqani.
It looked pretty good.	Allin allinmi rikchakurqa.
Maybe very, very wrong.	Ichapas ancha, ancha pantasqa.
But this was not the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Yes, that's good.	Arí chayna allinmi.
Yeah that’s what it looks like.	Arí chaymi rikchakun.
Please share this information.	Ama hina kaspa, kay willayta willay.
I want to do more.	Astawan ruwayta munani.
Again, don’t be stupid.	Yapamanta, ama sonso kaychu.
This is a player.	Kayqa huk pukllaqmi.
That first night alone.	Chay ñawpaq tuta sapallan.
Lots to do, or nothing to do.	Achka ruwanapaq, utaq mana imatapas ruwanapaq.
Does anyone know why this might be?.	¿Pipas yachanchu imarayku kay kanman?.
I couldn’t stop eating.	Manam mikhuyta saqiyta atirqanichu.
We’re tired of it.	Sayk’usqa kayku.
I thought maybe it would be appropriate to say so.	Yuyarqanim ichapas chayna niyta allin kanman nispa.
But there was no other option.	Ichaqa manan huk ruwayqa karqanchu.
He was surprised and happy to be there.	Payqa admirasqa hinaspa kusisqam tarikurqa chaypi kasqanmanta.
You were something.	Imapas karqanki.
I saw him at home, twice.	Wasipi payta rikurqani, iskay kutita.
But there is a downside.	Ichaqa kanmi huk mana allin.
Or anyway, anyway.	Utaq imayna kaptinpas.
Most of the time things are very wrong.	Yaqa llapanpim imapas ancha mana allinchu.
He did it alone.	Sapallanmi ruwarqa.
There’s nothing you can do about it.	Mana ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
You can never be able to.	Manam haykapipas atiwaqchu.
So, he was worried.	Chaymi, payqa llakisqa kasqa.
Then he came along.	Chaymantam hamurqa.
It was about a week ago.	Yaqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
That was amazing really.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa chiqaptapuni.
There are a lot of strangers.	Achka mana riqsisqa runakunam kachkan.
Nobody can play like that.	Manan pipas chay hinata pukllayta atinmanchu.
So I thought that was what he meant.	Chaymi piensarqani chayta niyta munasqanmanta.
Why should he do it? 	¿Imanasqataq ruwanan?
Learn more about it here.	Kaypi astawan yachanki chaymanta.
Can't get any better than that.	Mana chaymanta aswan allinta tariyta atinchu.
It was the girl with him.	Paywan kuska kaq sipasmi kasqa.
I think that is something.	Chayqa imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
I saw him last week, twice.	Qayna semanan payta rikurqani, iskay kutita.
It was a crazy day.	Loco punchawmi karqa.
So yeah, there it is.	Chaymi arí, chaypim kachkan.
But then again, isn’t it always?.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ¿manachu sapa kuti?.
He couldn’t go anywhere.	Payqa manan maymanpas riyta atinmanchu karqan.
That was just me.	Chayqa ñuqallam karqani.
I don’t think that at all.	Manam chaytaqa piensanichu ni imapipas.
He couldn’t say anymore.	Payqa manañan niyta atirqanchu.
I know those people are out there.	Yachanim chay runakuna hawapi kasqankuta.
He is certainly the latter.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin qhepa kaq.
It’s sad and angry.	Chayqa llakisqa, phiñasqa ima.
In fact, there’s no chance.	Chiqaptaqa, manam kanchu chansa.
But you can’t do this.	Ichaqa manan kayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Maybe twenty or thirty years.	Ichapas iskay chunka kimsa chunka wata.
I thought that was something important.	Chayqa imapas importante kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He didn’t need more time.	Payqa manan aswan tiempota necesitarqanchu.
I wonder if this was unique.	Tapukuni sichus kay sapallan karqa.
I could never really stop him.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni harkayta atirqanichu.
Now the third one.	Kunanqa kimsa kaq.
Everything is laid out before that.	Tukuy imapas chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa churasqa kachkan.
Tom was worried.	Tomqa llakisqa kasharqan.
So that’s pretty cool.	Chaymi chayqa ancha sumaq.
He is currently a patient in the hospital.	Payqa kunan pacha hospitalpi unqusqa kachkan.
What am I doing wrong here.	Imatataq kaypi mana allinta ruwachkani.
Not if but when.	Mana sichus ichaqa hayk’aqmi.
And the more the better.	Hinaspa aswan achka kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
He’s a little crazy.	Payqa huk chhikantan loco kashan.
It was good for him.	Allinmi karqa paypaq.
He was anything but crazy.	Payqa imapas karqan aswanpas loco.
That's really bad.	Chayqa chiqaptam mana allinchu.
I know how to do that.	Chay ruwaytaqa yachanim.
I strongly disagree here.	Kaypiqa sinchitan mana acuerdopichu kani.
You can't leave this out.	Kaytaqa manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t want to tell anyone.	Mana pitapas niyta munarqanichu.
You want to win everything all the time.	Tukuy imatam tukuy tiempo atipayta munanki.
He really shouldn't.	Chiqaptaqa manam ruwananchu.
He is the worst.	Paymi aswan mana allinqa.
I have to do that.	Ñuqaqa chaytam ruwanay kachkan.
It was good for that, at least.	Chaypaqqa allinmi karqa, aswanpas.
He is known for it.	Payqa chayraykum riqsisqa.
So then that came along.	Chaymi chaymantaqa chay hamurqa.
Better for you.	Aswan allin qampaq.
You have to do things right.	Imatapas allintam ruwanayki.
Maybe it’s faster, maybe not.	Ichapas aswan utqaylla kanman, ichapas mana.
I’ve never seen that either.	Ñoqapas manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
I couldn’t remember anything.	Manam imatapas yuyariyta atirqanichu.
It’s actually better.	Chiqaptaqa aswan allinmi.
A letter came for me.	Huk cartata hamurqa ñuqapaq.
It makes for easy conversation, at least.	Facil rimayta ruwan, aswanpas.
You are also a wise man.	Qampas yachaysapa runam kanki.
He was a big nothing.	Payqa huk hatun mana imapas karqa.
That was the best way to do it.	Chayna ruwaymi aswan allin karqa.
This is beyond stupidity.	Kayqa sonso kaymantaqa aswan hatunmi.
And they’re mine, thank you.	Hinaspa paykunaqa ñuqapa kanku, gracias.
That makes it easier.	Chaywanmi mana sasachu.
But I know what it is.	Ichaqa yachanin ima kasqanmanta.
Maybe it won’t be.	Ichapas mana kanqachu.
It was a bad time.	Mana allin tiempon karqan.
That’s just like me.	Chayqa ñuqa hinam.
Maybe time to go faster.	Ichapas tiempo aswan utqaylla rinanpaq.
Eat the larger one first.	Ñawpaqtaqa aswan hatun kaqta mikhuy.
He certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ruwan.
So many ifs.	Chaymi achka sichus.
This is clearly not the case here.	Kayqa sut’inmi kaypiqa mana chay hinachu.
Can you maybe.	¿Atiwaqchu ichapas.
Something that should be somewhere.	Maypipas kanan imapas.
I still don't know why.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
No one was like that.	Manas pipas chay hinachu karqan.
But they were happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam karqaku.
Do the action.	Chay ruwayta ruway.
Obviously he was new.	Sut’inmi payqa mosoq kasharqan.
But stupid me.	Ichaqa sonso ñuqa.
Something is not quite right there.	Imapas manam allintachu chaypiqa kachkan.
But maybe second best.	Ichaqa ichapas iskay kaq allin kaq.
He was sure of that.	Chayna kasqanmantam payqa seguro karqa.
He was a wicked wicked man.	Payqa millay millay runam karqa.
This much, you knew.	Kay achkata, yacharqanki.
And then it turned out for the best.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa allinpaq lluqsirqa.
About two weeks out here.	Kay hawapi yaqa iskay semana.
Actually things weren't right about this.	Chiqaptaqa imapas manam allinchu karqa kaymanta.
Tell me what happened.	Imachus pasasqanmanta niy.
That’s not good at all.	Chayqa manan allinchu ni imapipas.
You can’t answer.	Mana kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
That’s why he was fired.	Chayraykum qarqusqa karqa.
Something did this.	Imapas kayta ruwarqa.
But then, maybe .	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, ichapas .
I couldn’t have said it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu karqa.
It’s better though.	Aswan allinmi ichaqa.
But maybe you knew that.	Ichaqa ichapas chayta yacharqanki.
You want to do better.	Munanki aswan allin ruwayta.
It’s not like he can help.	Manan yanapayta atinman hinachu.
It must be unreasonable.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
They were the craziest.	Paykunaqa aswan loco karqanku.
It’s really hard to do nothing all day.	Chiqamanta tukuy p’unchaw mana imatapas ruwayqa sinchi sasa.
He was on earth all the time.	Payqa kay pachapi tukuy tiempon karqan.
He’s everybody, and he’ll be nice.	Payqa tukuy runam, sumaqmi kanqa.
This is a very good idea on my part.	Kayqa ancha allin yuyayniyuqmi ñuqamanta.
There’s something really interesting about this.	Kaypiqa kanmi imapas chiqap sumaq.
More than that, that.	Aswan chaymanta, chay.
You are not ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manam listochu kachkanki.
I don’t want to tell you.	Manam willayta munanichu.
No one knows what happened next.	Chay qhepaman imachus pasasqanmantaqa manan pipas yachanchu.
Here’s how it looks right now.	Kaypi kunan pacha imayna kasqanmanta.
I’m now that.	Ñuqa kunan chayta.
Either way he knows what this could be.	Imayna kaptinpas yachanmi ima kay kanman.
Again he couldn’t.	Hukmanta mana atirqanchu.
That would have been a smart move.	Chayqa yachaysapa ruwaymi kanman karqa.
First one, then two.	Ñawpaqtaqa huk, chaymanta iskay.
Everything seems rather absurd.	Tukuy imapas aswan mana yuyayniyuq hinam rikchakun.
No, he would do what he had to do.	Manan, imachus ruwananta ruwanman karqan.
This was still very interesting though.	Kayqa hinallam ancha sumaq karqa ichaqa.
He was hers now, really.	Payqa kunanmi paypaq karqa, chiqaptapuni.
And it’s very nice.	Hinaspa ancha sumaq.
He knew he was going to be alone for a while.	Payqa yacharqanmi huk rato sapallan kananta.
This should be really interesting.	Kayqa chiqaptam sumaq kanan.
This means you’ll have to do more work.	Kayqa niyta munan aswan llamk’ayta ruwanayki tiyan.
We never disagree on that.	Chaypiqa manan hayk’aqpas mana acuerdopichu kayku.
Obviously he couldn’t do that.	Sut’inmi mana chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
But not after that.	Ichaqa mana chaymantaqa.
Bad ugly, bad ugly.	Mana allin millay, mana allin millay.
This is doing very well.	Kayqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
You don’t know what the future holds.	Manan yachankichu hamuq tiempopi imakuna pasananta.
They weren’t happy.	Paykunaqa manam kusisqachu karqaku.
Perhaps this did not seem right.	Yaqapaschá kayqa mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
Today is a good day.	Kunan punchawmi allin punchaw.
He wasn’t really upset.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu phiñasqa kasharqan.
He couldn’t stand it.	Payqa manan aguantayta atinmanchu karqan.
So, at least.	Chaymi, aswan pisi.
This is a good thing.	Kay nisqanqa allinmi.
No, it’s better this way.	Manan, aswan allinmi kay hinaqa.
Repeat, and repeat.	Yapamanta ruway, hinaspa yapamanta ruway.
So that was it.	Chaymi chay karqa.
It’s not a good idea to do that.	Mana allinchu chayta ruwayqa.
They were pretty good.	Paykunaqa allin allinmi karqaku.
It may not be true in the future.	Hamuq tiempopiqa manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
That was the senior one.	Chayqa karqan kuraq kaqmi.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas kanan.
He didn't want to say anything at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
I do it like the next person.	Chaytaqa qatiqnin runa hinam ruwani.
There will be two things.	Chaypin iskay imakuna kanqa.
One cannot be too sure.	Huk runaqa manan nishuta seguro kayta atinmanchu.
I want to know more about him.	Paymanta astawan yachayta munani.
He was very happy.	Payqa llumpay kusisqam karqa.
And that was tough.	Hinaspa chayqa sinchi sasa karqan.
You know, somebody else .	Yachanki, pipas huk .
Maybe it’s just what he did.	Ichapas chaylla ruwasqanmanta.
It’s rather ridiculous.	Aswan asikunapaq hinam.
He said that he did.	Paymi nirqa chayna ruwasqanmanta.
You are really there.	Chiqaptam chaypi kachkanki.
I don’t really want to go.	Manam anchatachu riyta munani.
That’s all over the city.	Chayqa tukuy llaqtapi.
So far it doesn't matter.	Kunankamaqa manam imananpaschu.
It’s a good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuq kaymi.
I still don't know where he is.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmantaqa.
Everything is worse.	Tukuy imapas aswan mana allinmi.
Everyone was there.	Sapa runam chaypi karqaku.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allintachu.
It felt like the middle of the night.	Kuska tuta hinam tarikurqa.
He did everything right.	Tukuy imata allinta ruwarqa.
That made me feel uncomfortable.	Chayqa mana allintachu tarikurqani.
That would be the moment.	Chayqa kanman karqan chay rato.
Of course, we should.	Chiqamanta, chayta ruwananchik tiyan.
He seemed to do that a lot actually.	Payqa chaytaqa anchata ruwaq hinam karqa chiqaptaqa.
Not saying anything.	Mana nispa.
This was all a process.	Kayqa tukuy imapas huk ruwaymi karqa.
It was like a brand new home.	Chayqa huk musuq wasi hinam karqa.
We have to do things right.	Imakunatapas allintam ruwananchik.
And then he quit.	Hinaspa chaymanta saqirqa.
I really don't want to tell her name.	Chiqaptaqa manam sutinta willayta munanichu.
I’m not good enough yet.	Manaraqmi allinchu kani.
It seems to be the case.	Chayna kanman hinam.
I’m afraid he’s a difficult man.	Manchakuni sasa runa kasqanmanta.
If you do a good job.	Allin llamkayta ruwanki chayqa.
But I wonder.	Ichaqa tapukuni.
He does a lot now.	Kunanqa anchatam ruwan.
Now you never know.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
He seems very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakun.
He wants to see her.	Payta rikuyta munan.
Maybe it was a good thing.	Ichapas allinmi karqa.
Very good at nothing.	Ancha allin mana imapipas.
Every hour really.	Sapa hora chiqaptapuni.
Really, really hurt.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta k’irisqa.
It could just be like this.	Kay hinallam kanman.
But it’s never a good idea to rush things.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman usqhaylla ruwayqa.
He didn’t need to think.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu yuyaymanayta.
But things at home weren't exactly great.	Ichaqa wasipi imapas mana allintachu hatun karqa.
Three days, he says.	Kimsa punchaw, nispas nin.
I catch it somewhere.	Maypipas hap'ini.
Or having a bad attitude.	Utaq mana allin yuyayniyuq kay.
It's pretty big, actually.	Allin hatunmi, chiqaptaqa.
I thought it was very good.	Ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
And now he wants to go there again.	Hinaspa kunanqa yapamanta chayman riyta munan.
And do something about what he did.	Hinaspa imatapas ruway pay ruwasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it would be too difficult.	Mana chaymantaqa, llumpay sasa kanman.
He didn’t want to hear the truth about her.	Payqa manan paymanta cheqaq kaqta uyariyta munarqanchu.
He always knew people were beautiful.	Sapa kutim yacharqa runakuna sumaq kasqankuta.
Tell me why he wants that.	Willaway imanasqa chayta munan.
But then one day something happened.	Ichaqa chaymantam huk punchaw imapas pasarqa.
Everything he expected.	Tukuy ima suyakusqanmanta.
No one was there, anyway.	Manam pipas chaypiqa karqachu, imayna kaptinpas.
Another really important feature.	Huk chiqap importante ruway.
I mean like really, nothing.	Niyta munani hina chiqap, mana imapas.
I learned a lot there.	Chaypiqa achkatam yacharqani.
It was the people.	Chayqa karqan runakuna.
Third, say.	Kimsa kaq, niy.
Good new fact.	Allin musuq chiqap.
He did, all right.	Payqa ruwarqa, allinmi.
He did something wrong.	Payqa imatapas mana allintam ruwarqa.
At least I don’t think so.	Aswanpas manan yuyaykunichu.
I have no idea how they are.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kasqankuta.
Go, he said.	Riy, nispa.
If it takes that long.	Chayna unayta ruwaptinqa.
Now is the right time.	Kunanmi allin tiempo.
Probably next summer.	Yaqapaschá hamuq verano killapi.
He looked like a stranger.	Payqa mana riqsisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Now that is no longer true.	Kunanqa manañan chayqa cheqaqchu.
Not bad at all, really.	Mana mana allinchu ni imapipas, chiqaptapuni.
She's really pretty.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq.
I really really did.	Chiqaptam chiqaptapuni ruwarqani.
No one knew what he would do next.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imatachus qhepaman ruwananta.
So that he had to do it.	Chaymi payqa ruwanan kasqanmanta.
Being alone.	Sapallan kay.
He says whatever he wants.	Payqa ima munasqantapas ninmi.
Nowhere but here.	Mana maypipas aswanpas kaypi.
I’m like I’m hungry.	Yarqasqa hinam kachkani.
Now it just makes sense.	Kunanqa chaylla yuyayniyuq.
Such a thing should not have been there.	Chay hinaqa manan chaypichu kanan karqan.
It just seems ridiculous right away.	Chaylla asikunapaq hina rikchakun chaylla.
And it worked out great for me.	Hinaspa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq lluqsirqa.
I don’t want to talk about this anymore.	Kaymantaqa manañam rimayta munanichu.

That will be together today.	Chayqa kanqa kuska kunan pacha.
But that’s stupid.	Ichaqa chayqa sonso kaymi.

You want to sing too.	Qampas takiyta munanki.
But you can’t take it from me.	Ichaqa manan ñoqamanta hap’iyta atiwaqchu.
He was black, all black.	Payqa yana, tukuy yana kasqa.
I'm not really ready for that yet.	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi chiqaptachu listo kachkani.
It was supposed to be here.	Kaypim kanan karqa.
He does, however, like it.	Paymi ichaqa gustan.
I’m sure he’d agree.	Seguro kani payqa acuerdopi kananmanta.
A very, very bad thing to do.	Ancha, ancha millay ruway.
He was a better player.	Payqa aswan allin pukllaqmi karqan.
He’s tough, but he wants it right.	Payqa sinchitan riman, ichaqa allintan munan.
He can really sing.	Payqa chiqaptam takiyta atin.
He will be here this evening.	Payqa kunan chisi kaypi kanqa.
It looked like a different city.	Huk llaqtamanmi rikchakurqa.
There are people like me.	Kanmi ñuqa hina runakuna.
He is there for now.	Payqa kunankamaqa chaypim kachkan.
It would be good to be with you.	Allinmi kanman qanwan kuska kayqa.

Real world, big time.	Chiqap pacha, hatun pacha.
Actually, no, it’s better than that.	Chiqaptaqa, manam, chaymantaqa aswan allinmi.
It was his first time.	Ñawpaq kaq kutillanmi karqan.
About three weeks ago.	Yaqa kimsa semana ñawpaqta.
He began to sleep soundly.	Payqa allintam puñuyta qallaykurqa.
I am really disappointed by it.	Chiqaptam chaywan hukmanyasqa kachkani.
It happens to me all the time.	Sapa kutim ñuqawanqa chayna kachkan.
I just wanted to tell you.	Chaylla willayta munarqani.
I want to make sure it’s safe.	Munani seguro kananpaq seguro kananpaq.
This is all very important.	Kay tukuy imapas ancha allinmi.
He would have done that at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chaynatam ruwanman karqa.
I wonder if I like it.	Tapukunitaqmi gustawanchu icha manachu chayta.
This is very popular.	Kay ancha riqsisqa.
He was, all right.	Paymi karqa, allinmi.
He wouldn’t be right.	Payqa mana allinchu kanman.
I know everything is fine again.	Yachanim yapamanta tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta.
Now it’s his turn.	Kunanqa paypaq.
He was pleased with the condition of the house.	Payqa kusisqam tarikurqa chay wasi imayna kasqanmanta.
A big one, for sure.	Huk hatun, seguro.
The reality was very difficult.	Chiqap kaqmi ancha sasa karqa.
What, he says	Ima, nin .
That’s kind of huge.	Chayqa huk laya hatunmi.
No, that is certainly not true.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chayqa mana cheqaqchu.
But of course, it wasn’t, not really.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqan, manan cheqaqtachu.
You are the right person to take the next step.	Qamqa kanki allin runam qatiqnin llamkayta ruwanaykipaq.
Like the world.	Kay pacha hina.
I think he’s coming home.	Piensani wasiyman kutimunanta.
He’s crazy.	Payqa loco.
Anything better than that.	Imapas chaymanta aswan allinqa.
I think this is better.	Kayqa aswan allin kananpaqmi yuyaykuni.
First of all, I am doing this.	Ñawpaqtaqa kaytam ruwachkani.
There is no more of that.	Manañam chaymantaqa kanchu.
I'm just so sorry, but there's nothing wrong with that.	Chayllam anchata llakikuni, ichaqa manam imapas chaypiqa kanchu.
Instead, he did nothing.	Aswanpas manan imapas ruwarqanchu.
And that’s bad.	Hinaspa chayta mana allinta.
No. This was unfortunate.	Manan kayqa llakikuypaqmi karqan.
It’s just been there.	Chayllaraqmi chaypi kachkan.
What is .	Imataq .
The result is a very good one.	Chay ruwasqanqa ancha allinmi.
I just haven’t found it yet.	Chayllaraqmi manaraq tarinichu.
He didn’t rush her.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu paytaqa ruwarqan.
He doesn’t think the best is yet to come.	Payqa manan yuyaykunchu aswan allinqa manaraq kananta.
This is where he failed.	Kaypim mana allinta ruwarqa.
Being too fast is not good for you.	Llumpay llumpay utqaylla kayqa manam allinchu qampaq.
He wasn't sure anymore.	Payqa manañam segurochu kasqa.
That seems unlikely.	Chayqa manapaschá hinachu rikch’akun.
You’re cold now.	Kunanmi chiri kanki.
You want to be better, and that’s pretty amazing.	Aswan allin kayta munanki, chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi.
That was pretty crazy though.	Chayqa ancha loco karqan ichaqa.
How can someone be that evil.	¿Imaynataq pipas chay millay kanman.
But that is easy to avoid.	Ichaqa chaytaqa mana ruwaymi facilmi.
If he is angry.	Sichus payqa phiñasqa kashan chayqa.
Maybe I want to hang out with you.	Ichapas qanwan kuska kayta munani.
The oldest in the world, maybe.	Kay pachapi aswan kuraq kaq, ichapas.
How did he know.	Imayna yacharqa.
But you 're the one	Ichaqa qanmi .
Then you want to know.	Chaymantam yachayta munanki.
I mean, it was ridiculous.	Niyta munani, asikunapaq hinam karqa.
He seemed surprised by it.	Payqa chaywan admirasqa hinam karqa.
I will do worse.	Aswan mana allintam ruwasaq.
Not sure though about this.	Mana segurochu ichaqa kaymanta.
I don't need it today.	Kunan punchawqa manam necesitasaqchu.
Another great month.	Huk hatun killa.
You are quite busy.	Qamqa allintam ocupasqa kachkanki.
He was immediately dismissed.	Chayllam qarqusqa karqa.
More afraid of him.	Aswan mancharisqa payta.
What could be the problem.	Imataq chay sasachakuy kanman.
Maybe it’s with me.	Ichapas ñuqawan kachkan.
And everything is fine with that.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas allinmi chaywan.
He wanted to make sure he was alone.	Payqa sapallan kasqanmantan seguro kayta munarqan.
This had to be as bad as it could be.	Kayqa atisqanman hina mana allin kanan karqan.
Being an adult is hard.	Kuraq runa kayqa sasam.
How he did it, he wasn't sure.	Imayna ruwasqanmanta, manas segurochu kasqa.
If you had a favorite, let me know.	Sichus huk munasqayki karqan chayqa, willaway.
Someone's going to get hurt.	Pipas k'irisqa kanqa.
He didn’t think long enough.	Payqa manan unaytachu yuyaykurqan.
The most recent one this week.	Aswan qhipa kaq kay semanapi.
Good morning, thank you.	Allin p'unchaw, gracias.
It came before everything else.	Tukuy imamanta ñawpaqtaraqmi hamurqa.
He doesn’t agree.	Payqa manan acuerdopichu kashan.
I knew it would happen one day.	Yacharqanim huk punchaw chayna kananta.
It wasn’t anything mean.	Manam imapas millay ruwaychu karqa.
That is certainly the best.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin aswan allinqa.
It is new every day.	Sapa punchawmi musuq kachkan.
Plus new money.	Astawan musuq qullqita.
That was stupid.	Chayqa sonso kaymi karqan.
I hope no one gets hurt.	Suyachkani mana pipas k’irisqa kananpaq.
Two months is good.	Iskay killa allin.
He was really furious.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sinchita phiñasqa kasharqan.
Every day was a learning day.	Sapa punchawmi yachay punchaw karqa.
I want to go with you.	Qanwan riyta munani.
But there’s not much you can do about it.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu chaymantaqa ruwawaq.
It sounds good, it looks good.	Allinmi uyarikun, allintam rikchakun.
He did that in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
A good one, yes, but human.	Allin kaq, arí, ichaqa runa hina.
At least that’s a good thing.	Aswanpas chayqa allinmi.
This was daytime.	Kayqa punchawmi karqa.
There was never another me.	Manam haykapipas huk ñuqaqa karqachu.
It was to be the last.	Chayqa qhepa kaqmi kanan karqan.
It's very clear now.	Ancha sut'inmi kunanqa.
Now was the time to do so.	Kunanmi chayta ruwanapaq tiempo karqan.
It can’t work.	Mana llamk’ayta atinchu.
Half an hour ago.	Kuska hora ñawpaqta.
I don’t want him to come with you.	Manam munanichu qanwan kuska hamunanta.
He took a window.	Huk ventanata hap’irqan.
This has never happened before.	Ñawpaq tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinaqa karqanchu.
But it 's just	Ichaqa chayllam .
That he wasn’t the man.	Mana chay runachu kasqanmanta.
He did everything quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan tukuy imatapas ruwarqan.
Know what the truth is.	Yachay imachus cheqaq kasqanmanta.
He knows everything is true.	Payqa yachanmi tukuy ima chiqap kasqanmanta.
That was an amazing thing for anyone to do.	Chayqa pipas ruwananpaqqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I can’t let him go.	Manam saqiyta atiymanchu ripunanpaq.
A week in fact.	Huk semana chiqaptaqa.
They are amazing at it.	Paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi chaypiqa kanku.
That was a lot safer.	Chayqa aswan segurom karqa.
This is always the best.	Kayqa sapa kutim aswan allinqa.
So yeah, for sure.	Chaymi arí, seguro.
Well, you know that!.	¡Allinmi, chaytam yachanki!.
These are injured people.	Kaykunaqa k’irisqa runakunam.
But it’s not good, no.	Ichaqa manan allinchu, manan.
That’s all you have to do, really.	Chaylla ruwanayki tiyan, chiqamanta.
But probably someone will.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá pipas ruwanqa.
There were a lot of people there.	Chaypim achka runakuna karqaku.
Much richer.	Ancha aswan qhapaq.
I think it was me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqa kasqayta.
I feel so sorry for him.	Anchatam llakikuni paymanta.
I was like you, once.	Ñuqapas qam hinam karqani, huk kuti.
No one likes everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas gustanchu.
Nothing more for him here.	Mana imapas aswan paypaq kaypi.
Once a week at most.	Semanapi huk kutita aswan achka.
I don’t want to have to do it again.	Manam munanichu yapamanta ruwanay kasqanmanta.
He had no reason to do so.	Manan imaraykupas chayta ruwananpaqqa karqanchu.
They both seemed nervous.	Iskayninkum mancharisqa hina karqaku.
You were a very good player.	Qamqa ancha allin pukllaqmi karqanki.
There will be no one better than me.	Manam pipas aswan allin ñuqaqa kanqachu.
One of them figured it out and that was it.	Hukninmi chayta yuyaykurqan chaymi chay hina karqan.
Someone was sure to be.	Pipas chayna kananpaqmi seguro karqa.
So here is a problem.	Chaymi kaypi huk sasachakuy kachkan.
I can't ask that.	Chaytaqa manam tapuyta atiymanchu.
Everything happened there.	Chaypi tukuy imapas pasarqa.
I actually said no.	Chiqaptaqa manam nispaymi nirqani.
This is an interesting feature.	Kayqa huk sumaq ruwaymi.
There is one thing.	Huk kaqmi kan.
Silly, silly, awful stuff.	Mana yuyayniyuq, mana yuyayniyuq, manchay imakuna.
Yes, it is not true.	Arí, manan cheqaqchu.
He sensed something was going on.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas pasashasqanmanta.
It was surprisingly difficult.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi sasa karqa.
There was never a reason before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan hayk’aqpas imaraykupas karqanchu.
It would be time, plenty of time, later.	Tiempo kanman, askha tiempo, qhepaman.
He really doesn’t want to answer.	Chiqamanta mana kutichiyta munanchu.
This did the job.	Kaymi chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
I learned a lot more about what was out there.	Aswan achkata yacharqani imakuna hawapi kasqanmanta.
He can’t beat that!.	¡Manan chayta atipayta atinchu!.
The hospitalist.	Chay hospitalpi kaq.
But that’s a very good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha allinmi.
He is not very good.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu.
That there should be no one.	Mana pipas kananta.
That, actually, is huge.	Chayqa, chiqaptaqa, hatunmi.
He was the most famous man in the world.	Payqa kay pachapi aswan riqsisqa runam karqa.
This was the and, to that.	Kaymi karqan chay hinaspa, chayman.
I hope he does well here.	Suyachkani kaypi allinta ruwananta.
I don't know why he's here.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
And now, here it was.	Hinaspa kunan, kaypi karqan.
I want to be the same person one day.	Kikin runa kaytam munani huk punchaw.
It certainly means that.	Cheqaqtapunin chay niyta munan.
There is no such thing as a fact.	Manam imapas kanchu chayta huk chiqap hina.
Learn more about me here.	Kaypi ñuqamanta astawan yachay.
He is not here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan.
One of them is your favorite.	Hukninmi munasqayki.
He said he was sure.	Payqa seguro kashasqanmantan nirqan.
Something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
You’re the smart one.	Qanmi kanki chay yachaysapa.
When will it be available? 	¿Hayk’aqmi kanqa?
They seem to be here all the time now.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempo kaypi hina kachkanku.
There was no one else.	Manam pipas huk hinaqa karqachu.
So it should be done regularly.	Chaymi sapa kutilla ruwana.
Maybe you know, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas yachanki, ichapas mana.
A good man though.	Allin runa ichaqa.
This is a rare practice.	Kayqa mana ancha riqsisqa ruwaymi.
One of the children was very upset.	Wawa hukninmi sinchita llakisqa kasharqan.
I am so happy to have him.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani paywan kasqaymanta.
Much more time.	Aswan achka tiempo.
Do you know why?.	¿Yachankichu imarayku?.
Still, he did wrong.	Chayna kaptinpas mana allintam ruwarqa.
You really want to walk now.	Chiqamanta kunan puriyta munanki.
He was always talking.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi rimaq.
They are anonymous.	Paykunaqa mana sutiyuq kanku.
Yes, in the future.	Arí, hamuq tiempopi.
He is no longer alone.	Manaña sapallanchu.
If so, then all is well.	Chayna kaptinqa, chaymantaqa tukuy allinmi.
I probably can.	Yaqapaschá atiyman.
He said he was there against his will.	Payqa nirqam mana munasqanmanta chaypi kasqanmanta.
There are many.	Kanmi achka.
I almost feel uncomfortable.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu sientekuni.
I think that’s a great restaurant.	Chayqa huk hatun mikhuy wasi kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
This would seem, well, stupid.	Kayqa, allinmi, sonso hina kanman.
He never wanted to.	Mana hayk’aqpas munarqanchu.
But he never imagined what would happen next.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu qhepaman imachus kananta.
That said a lot.	Chayqa anchatam nirqa.
The next morning was fine.	Paqarin paqarinmi allin karqa.
He wanted her to know this moment.	Payqa kay rato yachananta munarqa.
It was black and white.	Yana yana kasqa.
They know he's not there.	Paykunaqa yachanku mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
And in many cases, it's not good.	Hinaspa achka kutipi, mana allinchu.
But he might not want to go.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana riyta munanmanchu.
Unfortunately, they are.	Llakikuypaqmi, paykunaqa kanku.
So everything will be the same as before.	Chaymi tukuy imapas ñawpaq hina kanqa.
I thought the real world was where it was.	Yuyarqanim chiqap pacha maypi kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t know exactly.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan.
Maybe this was all too easy.	Ichapas kayqa tukuy imapas llumpay facil karqa.
However, it is a good idea.	Ichaqa, allin yuyayniyuqmi.
Nothing really wrong with that.	Mana imapas chiqap mana allinchu chaypiqa.
Almost overnight.	Yaqa huk tutamanta.
They have no idea what they are.	Mana yuyayniyuq ima kasqankuta.
Everyone agreed.	Lliwmi acuerdopi karqaku.
Trouble is, he wants it all the time.	Sasachakuy, payqa tukuy tiempon munan.
It couldn’t have been all bad, or all good.	Manan llapan mana allinchu kanman karqan, nitaq llapan allinchu kanman karqan.
But it is wonderful that he does.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwan chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Something out there drove him away.	Chay hawapi imapas paytaqa qarqusqa.
It's never good, really.	Manam haykapipas allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
I’ve always wanted to do that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayta ruwayta munarqani.
He is quite drunk.	Payqa allintam machasqa kachkan.
So it’s not like a human being.	Chaymi mana runa hinachu.
These are good things.	Kaykunaqa allinmi.
Why, why now.	Imarayku, imarayku kunan.
Maybe ten won’t be good enough.	Ichapas chunka mana allinchu kanqa.
I’m glad to make him then.	Kusikuni payta chaymanta ruwanaypaq.
And he was very disappointed.	Hinaspa anchata hukmanyasqa karqa.
No one should be so happy.	Manan pipas chay hina kusisqachu kanan.
He wanted to believe it.	Chaytaqa creeyta munarqa.
That was almost funny.	Chayqa yaqapaschá asikunapaq hina karqan.
A lot, though.	Achka, ichaqa.
This could be him.	Kayqa paymi kanman.
So far, the process has worked.	Kunankamaqa chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
He hasn’t done much yet.	Payqa manaraqmi anchatachu ruwan.
This should now be clearer.	Kayqa kunanqa aswan sut’inmi kanan.
Is he the one?	¿Payqa?
I’m really angry.	Chiqamanta phiñasqa kachkani.
Please be reasonable.	Ama hina kaspa, allin yuyayniyuq kay.
He didn’t really look at her.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu qhawarisqa.
He was scared, now.	Payqa mancharisqa, kunanqa.
For more information.	Astawan kananpaq.
It’s the most mysterious thing.	Aswan pakasqa kaqmi.
The reality is that this is ambiguous.	Chiqap kaqmi kayqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
This is a good one this year.	Kayqa allinmi kay wata.
I'm fine, actually.	Allinmi kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
But he couldn’t be, not really.	Ichaqa manan kayta atirqanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
Yes, you were there.	Arí, chaypim karqanki.
I couldn’t hear it either.	Ñuqapas manam uyariyta atirqanichu.
There were no such people at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam chayna runakunaqa karqachu.
This makes it very difficult.	Chaywanmi ancha sasachakuypi tarikun.
You were right, man.	Allintam nirqanki, runa.
Like, it’s very difficult.	Imayna, ancha sasa.
Maybe ten hours.	Ichapas chunka pacha.
But it doesn’t sound safe.	Ichaqa manan segurochu uyarikun.
He is a single person.	Payqa huk sapallan runam.
I mean, that was pretty bad.	Niyta munani, chayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
No chance of that now.	Mana chaymanta chansa kunan.
This was obviously too easy.	Kayqa sut’inmi nishuta facil karqan.
I never wanted that.	Manam haykapipas chaynataqa munarqanichu.
He always says he can tell.	Payqa sapa kutim willayta atisqanmanta nin.
It’s amazing actually.	Admirakuypaqmi chiqaptaqa.
Better than you, better than me.	Qanmanta aswan allin, ñoqamanta aswan allin.
That’s not the right thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
He wouldn't want to go there.	Chaymanqa manam riyta munanmanchu karqa.
Something must be.	Imapas kanan.
The man knows who he is.	Chay runaqa yachanmi pi kasqanta.
There they are.	Chaypin paykunaqa.
I couldn’t figure out why.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
So all good now.	Chaymi tukuy allin kunan.
Maybe this is always the case.	Ichapas kayna sapa kuti kan.
I enjoy the learning process.	Yachay ruwayqa anchatam kusikuni.
You’ve been alone for a long time.	Unayñan sapallayki kashanki.
That will go fast.	Chayqa utqayllam rinqa.
Yes that is a good thing.	Arí chayqa allin ruwaymi.
And he was outside.	Hinaspa payqa hawapi kasqa.
What were they like? 	¿Imaynataq karqaku?
That wouldn’t be funny.	Chayqa mana asikunapaq hinachu kanman.
In fact, he did it alone.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
He was quite drunk.	Payqa allintam machasqa kasqa.
And, here’s another one.	Hinaspa, kaypi huk kaq.
But at least it looks like it.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna rikchakun.
Maybe something was wrong.	Ichapas imapas mana allinchu karqa.
Not doing is the best thing to do.	Mana ruwayqa aswan allin ruwaymi.
That’s not where you want to be.	Chayqa manan maypichus kayta munankichu.
So I did it.	Chaymi ruwarqani.
This behavior cannot be tolerated.	Kay ruwaytaqa manam aguantayta atichwanchu.
No, that was stupid.	Manan, chayqa sonso kaymi karqan.
But okay, everything is fine now.	Ichaqa allinmi, kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
They are so funny.	Paykunaqa ancha asikunapaq hinam kanku.
We are not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanchik.
I'm not sure if that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kaptinqa.
This is the time to act.	Kaymi ruwanapaq tiempo.
I really intend to do that.	Chiqamanta yuyaykuni chayta ruwayta.
It’s more difficult.	Aswan sasam.
But he doesn't do anything now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imatapas ruwanchu.
And that makes for a great story.	Hinaspa chaymi hatun willakuyta ruwan.
The second problem.	Iskay kaq sasachakuy.
I think you know where that is.	Yuyaykuni maypi chay kasqanmanta yachasqaykita.
But, of course he did.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi chayta ruwarqan.
You’re happy, right?.	Kusisqam kachkanki ¿aw?.
I was a silly girl.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuq sipasmi karqani.
It makes everything more uncertain and more interesting.	Tukuy imata aswan mana seguro kananpaq, aswan sumaq kananpaq ima ruwan.
Do it, and you’ll do better.	Chayta ruway, aswan allintan ruwanki.
Maybe one day, then again, maybe not.	Ichapas huk punchaw, chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas mana.
Of course, that was a bad thing.	Chiqamanta, chayqa mana allinchu karqa.
If you are.	Sichus qan.
Who wants money.	Pitaq qullqita munan.
I can’t be that uncertain.	Manam chayna mana seguro kayta atiymanchu.
I hope it will be good on its own.	Suyachkani sapallan allin kananta.
I will always be like this.	Sapa kutim kayna kasaq.
This can never be easy.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas facilchu kanman.
I was fine with that.	Chaywanmi allin karqani.
But yes, he really did.	Ichaqa arí, cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
Otherwise, nothing will work.	Mana chayqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
You can’t find it.	Manam tariyta atiwaqchu.
Now I could never live there.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas chaypi tiyayta atirqanichu.
Eventually you will be disappointed.	Qhepamanmi hukmanyasqa kanki.
He knew they were ready.	Payqa yacharqanmi listo kasqankuta.
But it’s really too innocent.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin nishuta mana huchayoq.
I was not very happy with that.	Chaywanqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqani.
Even so, this is not always the case.	Chayna kaptinpas manam sapa kutichu chayna kan.
But that wasn’t the case, it just happened.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, chayllaraqmi karqan.
I want it never to be black.	Munani mana haykapipas yana kananpaq.
I tend to overthink it.	Ñuqaqa chayta llumpayta yuyaymanayta munani.
You have to do something again.	Imatapas yapamanta ruwanayki tiyan.
I don't think so, but you never know.	Manam chaynataqa piensanichu, ichaqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
Now I am a human being.	Kunanqa runam kani.
Not good but not bad.	Mana allinchu ichaqa mana mana allinchu.
It was a meaningful thing to do.	Chayqa karqan imapaqpas allinpaq qhawarisqa ruwaymi.
It was a difficult thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa sasam karqa.
He still couldn't find it.	Hinallam mana tariyta atirqachu.
I’m not very happy either.	Ñuqapas manam ancha kusisqachu kani.
Okay, so it’s easy.	Allinmi, chaymi mana sasachu.
But one never knows.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas huk runaqa yachanchu.
But you are beautiful in a different way.	Ichaqa huk hina sumaqmi kanki.
This, or that.	Kay, icha chay.
Everything seemed wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
Pretending to be innocent now will not work.	Kunanqa mana huchayoq hina ruwayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
This truth exists everywhere in the world.	Kay cheqaq kaqmi kay pachapi maypipas kashan.
Something amazing happened here.	Kaypiqa admirakuypaqmi imapas pasarqa.
If you do, we’re in luck.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, suerteyoqmi kayku.
I’ve heard it, too.	Ñuqapas uyarirqanim.
He took his first look at his new home.	Paymi ñawpaq kutita mosoq wasinta qhawarirqan.
It certainly made him.	Cheqaqtapunin paytaqa ruwarqan.
They’re fine with that.	Paykunaqa allinmi chaywanqa.
You're tired of it.	Sayk'usqa kanki.
Funnily enough, it was a girl.	Asikunapaq hina, huk sipasmi karqan.
He doesn’t want to eat.	Payqa manan mikhunata munanchu.
He would do it anyway.	Payqa imayna kaptinpas chayta ruwanman.
That would be human.	Chayqa runa hinam kanman.
A child is a man.	Huk wawa runa.
I can be happy.	Kusisqa kayta atiyman.
And several times over.	Hinaspa achka kutita chaymanta.
He never knows.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yachanchu.
But it should be here soon.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kaypi kanan.
In fact, it’s better than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymantaqa aswan allinmi.
It seemed unreasonable.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
Hopefully, it wouldn’t be too bad.	Munaymanmi, mana ancha mana allinchu kanman.
These people were crazy, of course.	Kay runakunaqa loco karqanku, chiqamanta.
A young man like you.	Qan hina wayna.
What a bad girl, he said.	Ima mana allin sipasmi, nispas nisqa.
But maybe he can do things.	Ichaqa ichapas imakunatapas ruwanman.
Someone did that.	Pipas chayta ruwarqa.
I know where they are together.	Yachanim maypi kuska kasqankuta.
I would love to go there one day.	Munaymanmi huk punchaw chayman riyta.
It might be too easy.	Yaqapaschá ancha facil kanman.
This is what he is thinking this morning.	Kaymi kunan paqarin yuyaykushan.
That would be quick.	Chayqa utqaylla kanman.
He immediately began to speak.	Chayllam rimayta qallaykurqa.
We had to do something.	Imapas ruwanayku karqa.
Maybe he knew who that person was.	Ichapas payqa yacharqa pi chay runa kasqanmanta.
This takes all day to do this.	Kayqa tukuy punchawmi kayta ruwanapaq.
He refused to share it with her.	Payqa manan paywan willayta munarqanchu.
And you act disappointed.	Hinaspa hukmanyasqa hina ruwanki.
But it failed spectacularly.	Ichaqa admirakuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwarqa.
You’ve been married for a long time.	Unayñan casarasqa kanki.
He will be halfway there.	Payqa kuskan kanqa.
But he wasn’t there.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu karqan.
This statement was just so ridiculous.	Kay rimayqa ancha asikunapaq hinallam karqa.
That is not human.	Chayqa manan runa hinachu.
Can't wait to sleep.	Mana suyayta atinchu puñuyta.
A man like you.	Qam hina runa.
That, happily, is now available.	Chayqa, kusisqa, kunan tarikun.
First one does it.	Ñawpaqtaqa hukninmi ruwan.
They are very tough people there.	Paykunaqa chaypiqa ancha sinchi runakunam kanku.
No matter how big it is.	Imayna hatun kaptinpas.
It is a completely new thing.	Chayqa tukuy imamanta musuq kaqmi.
That was a wonderful thing to be married to.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa casarasqa kayqa.
I really look forward to it again.	Chiqaptam hukmanta suyachkani.
I was there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi karqani.
I knew something like this would happen.	Yacharqanim kayna imapas pasananta.
Not a big deal anyway.	Mana hatun ruwaychu imayna kaptinpas.
But he was probably alone.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá sapallan kasharqan.
What is he, he is.	Imataq payqa.
At home all afternoon.	Wasipi tukuy tarde.
He couldn’t answer.	Mana kutichiyta atirqachu.
There isn’t a yes.	Manam kanchu arí.
Do it tomorrow.	Paqarin ruway.
He is a terrible man.	Payqa manchay runam.
I live in the area.	Chaypim yachani.
So if it’s here tonight, it’s here.	Chaymi kunan tuta kaypi kashan chayqa, kaypi kashan.
I didn’t want that, but this was fine.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu, ichaqa kayqa allinmi karqa.
But then again, maybe he would.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas payqa ruwanman.
I do a lot of it.	Anchatam ruwani.
We repeated this process every week.	Kay ruwaytaqa sapa semanan yapamanta ruwaq kayku.
Okay maybe a little bit.	Allinmi ichapas huk chikan.
It was so recent.	Chayna chayllaraqmi karqa.
He knows you are here with him.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi paywan kasqaykita.
It’s probably the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
I’m not ready for it.	Manam listochu kachkani.
One thing would be wrong.	Huk ruwaymi mana allinchu kanman.
I always wanted to play hard.	Sapa kutim sinchita pukllayta munarqani.
Obviously, he was wrong.	Sut’inmi, payqa mana allintachu nisqa.
I can't hold him.	Manam paytaqa hapiyta atiymanchu.
He didn’t need to hear it.	Payqa manan necesitarqanchu uyariyta.
And everybody knows that.	Hinaspa chaytaqa llapallanku yachanku.
He opened it carefully.	Chaytaqa allintam kicharirqa.
And that’s what he was.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa karqan.
That is not the way to do it.	Chaytaqa manam chaynatachu ruwana.
This is where the problem came.	Kaypim chay sasachakuy hamurqa.
Okay, that didn't take long.	Allinmi, chayqa manam unaytachu pasarqa.
He is talking like a madman.	Payqa loco hinam rimachkan.
There must be three.	Kimsa kanan tiyan.
First of all, he was the first person to speak up.	Ñawpaqtaqa paymi ñawpaqta rimaq runa karqan.
No, it won’t be good.	Manan, manan allinchu kanqa.
I can’t walk or sit or sleep.	Manam puriyta nitaq tiyayta nitaq puñuyta atinichu.
Why did he want her.	Imaraykutaq payta munarqa.
I actually think this would be a good thing to do.	Chiqaptaqa piensani kayqa allin ruwaymi kanman.
Couldn't hold a job.	Mana llamk'ayta hap'iyta atirqanchu.
Very perhaps it would be right.	Ancha ichapas allinta kanman.
Yesterday was a great day!.	¡Qayna punchawmi ancha allin punchaw karqa!.
I'm not quite sure how to go about doing this.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam kayta ruwanaypaq risaq.
He was nowhere in the future.	Payqa manan maypipas karqanchu hamuq tiempopi.
I’m kind of skeptical.	Ñuqaqa huk laya iskayrayani.
One would like to think that this is the case.	Huk runaqa chayna kasqanmantam yuyaymanayta munanman.
So very sure of him.	Chaymi ancha seguro paymanta.
There must be a safe house.	Chaypin seguro kanan wasi.
Act like you have no idea whatsoever.	Mana ima yuyayniyuq hina ruway.
No, he couldn’t have done that.	Manan, manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
You can never have that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa atiwaqchu.
There was nothing he could do.	Manas ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
And he was happy in that.	Hinaspa chaypi kusisqa kasqa.
So, good for him.	Chaymi, allin paypaq.
Say everything would be fine.	Niy tukuy imapas allinmi kanman nispa.
He can do what no one else has done.	Payqa mana pipas ruwasqanta ruwanman.
I feel pretty secure.	Allin segurom tarikuni.
Tell me what it’s like.	Willaway imayna kasqanmanta.
It was a great experience.	Hatunmi karqa.
A great guy.	Huk hatun wayna.
Yes, it would be very easy.	Arí, ancha facilmi kanman.
There is no point here.	Kaypiqa manam imapaqpas kanchu.
But it’s not nearly enough.	Ichaqa manan yaqa chayllachu.
It would have made less sense.	Aswan pisi yuyayniyuq kanman karqan.
You know immediately when something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kaptinqa chayllam yachanki.
It was supposed to be late.	Tarde kanan karqa.
He looked kind of annoyed.	Payqa huk laya phiñasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
That’s not too difficult.	Chayqa manan ancha sasachu.
I always feel more alone when it's cold.	Sapa kutim chiri kaptinqa aswan sapallay tarikuni.
She meant a lot to him.	Payqa anchatan paypaq importante karqan.
Say that it is not.	Mana chayna kasqanmanta niy.
I am above everything outside.	Hawapi tukuy imamanta aswan hatunmi kani.
He knew everything about it.	Payqa tukuy imatam chaymanta yacharqa.
So thank you again.	Chaymi hukmanta gracias.
I haven’t done it before.	Manaraqmi ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanichu.
Not really sure why.	Mana chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Obviously, they weren’t.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqanku.
And then he was.	Hinaspa chaymanta payqa karqan.
A couple of weeks.	Iskay kimsa semana.
How to be happy alone, happy alone, happy alone.	Imaynatataq sapallayki kusisqa, sapallan kusisqa, sapallan kusisqa.
Yes, it certainly is.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chhayna kashan.
This felt like home.	Kayqa wasi hinam tarikurqa.
Then, something happened.	Chaymanta, imapas pasarqa.
Faster, slower speed.	Aswan utqaylla, aswan pisi utqaylla.
It is no longer available today.	Kay tiempopiqa manañan kanchu.
But today it is a harsh reality.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa sinchi cheqaq kaqmi.
So, they disagree.	Chaymi, mana acuerdopichu kachkanku.
Maybe this night was.	Ichapas kay tutaqa karqa.
The crowd is not real.	Chay askha runakunaqa manan cheqaqchu kanku.
I mean, this is what we did.	Niyta munani, kaytam ruwarqayku.
There is no one better.	Manam pipas aswan allinqa kanchu.
Make a strong response.	Huk sinchi kutichiyta ruway.
This is two years.	Kayqa iskay wata.
First of all, the first one is wrong.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñawpaq kaqmi mana allinchu.
This sounds about right.	Kayqa yaqa allinmi uyarikun.
This is not humane.	Kayqa mana runa hinachu.
You had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki karqan.
And I want to know more.	Hinaspa astawan yachayta munani.
That was completely wrong.	Chayqa tukuy imapipas mana allinmi karqa.
I’d be better off too.	Ñuqapas aswan allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t go along with it.	Payqa manan chaywanqa riyta atinmanchu karqan.
I know he wants to tell himself.	Yachanim pay kikin willayta munasqanmanta.
We cannot do that again.	Chaytaqa manañam hukmanta ruwayta atichwanchu.
I have no idea what that was about.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
Tomorrow will be a better day.	Paqarinmi aswan allin punchaw kanqa.
That was something'.	Chayqa karqan imapas'.
But now it’s not so easy.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan chay hina facilchu.
It’s good to talk to us.	Allinmi ñuqaykuwan rimayqa.
He barely had her.	Payqa yaqapaschá paytaqa hap’irqan.
They all were, in fact.	Llapallankum karqaku, chiqaptaqa.
It just doesn’t exist.	Chaylla mana kanchu.
It came and went, actually.	Chayqa hamurqa hinaspa rirqa, chiqaptaqa.
Everything is exposed.	Tukuy imapas hawaman churasqa.
So they are innocent.	Chaymi paykunaqa mana huchayoq kanku.
It was the coldest thing.	Aswan chiri kaqmi karqa.
It seemed so unimportant now.	Kunanqa ancha mana importante hinam rikchakurqa.
I thought it looked beautiful.	Sumaq rikchayniyuq kananpaqmi piensarqani.
But it was a milestone.	Ichaqa huk hatun ruwaymi karqan.
I thought, well, there it is.	Yuyarqanim, allinmi, chaypim kachkan.
He felt terrified of humanity.	Runa kaymanta mancharisqa tarikurqa.
So don’t do this.	Chaymi ama kayta ruwaychu.
You are a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runam kanki.
No, it’s not a human being.	Manan, manan runachu.
You are not like him.	Manam pay hinachu kanki.
Maybe tonight’s performance will be.	Ichapas kunan tuta ruwayqa kanqa.
Two months here, three months there.	Iskay killa kaypi, kimsa killa chaypi.
Like people, actually.	Runakuna hinam, chiqaptaqa.
I know how hard it is sometimes.	Yachanim wakin kutipi imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
That worked out very well.	Chayqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
There was no reason not to do so.	Manam imaraykupas karqachu chaynata mana ruwananpaqqa.
Ten years ago.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
However, it is very good.	Ichaqa, ancha allinmi.
Maybe a teacher.	Ichapas huk yachachiq.
That was all it really was.	Chayllam chiqaptapuni karqa.
Almost like drunk.	Yaqa machasqa hina.
No, you can’t stay the night with me.	Manan, manan ñoqawan tuta qhepakuyta atiwaqchu.
It could have been anyone after all this.	Tukuy kay qhepamanmi pipas kanman karqan.
I think it would be good.	Allinmi kanman nispam piensani.
You do it right away.	Qamqa chayllam ruwanki.
She knew what he thought of her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
There was nothing alone.	Sapallanmi mana imapas karqachu.
Yes, all the time.	Arí, tukuy tiempo.
I don’t want to remember.	Manam yuyariyta munanichu.
Who else, who is better.	Pi huk, pi aswan allin.
This was really excessive.	Kayqa chiqaptam llumpay karqa.
He thought that was really nice of her.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayqa cheqaq sumaq kasqanmanta paymanta.
He may not be able to.	Payqa manapaschá atinmanchu.
It's hard to be sure how many.	Sasam hayka kasqanmanta seguro kay.
He couldn’t stay.	Payqa manan qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
The best one, maybe.	Aswan allin kaq, ichapas.
Maybe I’ll do it from here.	Ichapas kaymanta ruwasaq.
Strong, beautiful, intelligent.	Sinchi, sumaq, yuyayniyuq.
You can’t leave.	Manan ripuyta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t know what to say or do.	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta nitaq imatapas ruwanaypaq.
I want something more.	Aswan imatapas munani.
A serious kid, maybe too serious.	Huk serio wawa, ichapas ancha serio.
That didn’t go so well.	Chayqa manan chay hina allintachu rirqan.
But it won’t be now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa kanqachu.
Black wanted to go one.	Yana huk riyta munarqan.
He was no such person.	Payqa manan chay hina pipas karqanchu.
Maybe he doesn’t want to help.	Ichapas mana yanapayta munanmanchu.
You may not be able to sleep.	Manapaschá puñuyta atiwaqchu.
No, boy, this is it.	Manan, wayna, kayqa.
I know you are very happy.	Yachanim ancha kusisqa kasqaykita.
But it was kind of funny.	Ichaqa huk laya asikunapaq hinam karqa.
That’s how you can do it.	Chaynatam ruwawaq.
I couldn’t, actually.	Manam atirqanichu, chiqaptaqa.
That’s actually a good thing.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi.
In fact, almost no one noticed.	Aswanpas yaqa mana pipas repararqanchu.
He knew too much in advance.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi llumpayta yacharqa.
You know this, you know.	Kayta yachanki.
He really didn't want her to do this.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanchu kayta ruwananta.
Three bad years.	Kimsa millay wata.
He left again.	Hukmanta ripurqan.
Everyone wants to know about you.	Llapallankum qammanta yachayta munanku.
But that doesn’t seem to be enough.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kanman hina.
They're tired and scared.	Paykunaqa sayk'usqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
I think he could have done that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwayta atinman karqan.
I mean, really, almost never.	Niyta munani, chiqap, yaqa mana haykapipas.
He was angry, and she knew it.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
Nowhere else in the world.	Mana maypipas kay pachapi.
And then he said it again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yapamanta nisqa.
Like, for real this time.	Imayna, chiqap kay kutipi.
He was home alone for the weekend.	Payqa sapallanmi wasinpi kasharqan semana tukuyta.
So it doesn’t halve well.	Chaymi mana allintachu kuskan.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Would it be better.	Aswan allinchu kanman.
Learn about the rest of the world.	Kay pachapi wakin runakuna imayna kasqanmanta yachay.
Nothing, now, no one.	Mana imapas, kunanqa, manam pipas kanchu.
Later I heard about it.	Qhepamanmi chayta uyarirqani.
Every single one happened.	Sapa sapallanmi pasarqa.
This is the one for you.	Kayqa qampaq kaqmi.
But who knows, maybe it works.	Ichaqa pi yachan, ichapas allin kanman.
There’s not much you can do about it.	Chaypaqqa manan askha ruway atiwaqchu.
I know what he likes.	Yachanim ima gustasqanmanta.
I didn’t see the letter.	Manam cartata rikurqanichu.
A man is here now.	Huk runam kunan kaypi kachkan.
He looked sad.	Llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
There was nothing I could do to help him.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu payta yanapanaypaq.
All this seems pretty simple.	Tukuy kaykunaqa allin facilmi rikchakun.
Yes, she was beautiful.	Arí, payqa sumaqmi karqa.
Now, it’s nice.	Kunanqa, sumaqmi.
Yes, he will be happy.	Arí, payqa kusisqam kanqa.
More recently.	Aswan kunan.
In fact, they are very happy about it.	Aswanpas ancha kusisqan kashanku chaymanta.
But sure, this is the last time.	Ichaqa seguro, kaymi qhepa kuti.
That’s the scary part about it.	Chayqa manchay kaqmi chaymantaqa.
You just did this.	Chayllaraqmi kayta ruwarqanki.
I have two main ideas.	Iskay hatun yuyayniyuqmi kani.
It makes no sense, how you did last night.	Manam imapaqpas valenchu, imaynatam qayna tuta ruwarqanki.
This really did mine.	Kayqa chiqaptam ñuqapa ruwarqa.
He knows it’s me.	Payqa yachanmi ñuqa kasqayta.
He was home this day.	Payqa kay p’unchaymi wasinpi kasharqan.
He thought a bit about what he could do.	Payqa huk chhikantan yuyaykurqan ima ruway atisqanmanta.
This is a tough one.	Kayqa sinchi kaqmi.
You and I, now.	Qampas ñuqapas, kunan.
Which was so good.	Imataq chayna allin karqa.
So things got better, but it wasn't easy.	Chaymi imapas aswan allin karqa, ichaqa manam facilchu karqa.
But therein lies the beauty.	Ichaqa chaypim sumaq kayqa kachkan.
He couldn’t remember anything, nothing.	Payqa manan imatapas yuyariyta atirqanchu, ni imatapas.
He’s a really great guy.	Payqa chiqap hatun runam.
Maybe that was a little quick on my part.	Ichapas chayqa huk chikan utqaylla ñuqamanta karqa.
He is all right.	Payqa tukuy allinmi.
Obviously he can’t do that anymore.	Sut’inmi kashan manaña chayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
Or many other things.	Utaq achka imakunatapas.
So that must be the main culprit.	Chaymi chaymi aswan huchayoq kanan.
He really knew stuff.	Payqa chiqaptam yacharqa imakunatapas.
He was probably here.	Payqa yaqapaschá kaypi karqan.
And, maybe some food.	Hinaspa, ichapas wakin mikhuy.
It was an hour ago that day.	Chay punchawqa huk hora ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
They want to try new things.	Paykunaqa musuq ruwaykunata ruwayta munanku.
No one knows how to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwayta yachanchu.
But no one wanted to deal with it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaywanqa atipayta munarqanchu.
This is, as always, the best part.	Kaymi, sapa kuti hina, aswan allin kaq.
Probably something stupid.	Yaqapaschá imapas sonso.
I don’t want to do anything.	Manam ima ruwaytapas munanichu.
He would do it as fast as he could.	Payqa atisqanman hinan usqhaylla ruwanman karqan.
It was, after all, ancient times.	Chayqa karqan, tukuy imamanta, ñawpaq tiempon.
No one thinks about it.	Manan pipas yuyaykunchu.
But you are the man.	Ichaqa qanmi kanki chay runa.
You really mean it.	Chiqaptam niyta munanki.
He's like a fool.	Payqa sonso hinam kachkan.
There isn’t much to say.	Manam ancha rimayqa kanchu.
Do that if you haven’t already.	Chayta ruway mana ruwarqanki chayqa.
He really thought about who he was.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yuyaykurqan pi kasqanmanta.
I think it worked out well.	Allintam lluqsirqa nispam piensani.
I don't want to talk about him anymore.	Manañam paymanta rimayta munanichu.
No, no one else did.	Manan, manan pipas chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
I want to do that as soon as possible.	Chaytaqa usqhaylla ruwayta munani.
So many things can go wrong.	Chaymi achka imapas mana allinchu kanman.
If you’re not happy and want to go, that’s fine.	Mana kusisqachu kanki hinaspa riyta munanki chayqa, allinmi.
He was never unhappy for any reason.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imaraykupas mana kusisqachu karqan.
But then things went terribly wrong.	Ichaqa chaymantam imapas llumpayta mana allintachu pasarqa.
This was a really big deal for me.	Kayqa chiqaptam hatun ruway karqa ñuqapaq.
In fact, it could be worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
I thought you were crazy.	Yuyarqanim loco kanki nispa.
Maybe this does.	Ichapas kay ruwan.
You can't let that happen.	Chayna kananta manam saqiyta atiwaqchu.
He did that yesterday, in fact.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi ruwarqa, chiqaptaqa.
Here’s the good stuff.	Kaypiqa allin kaqmi kachkan.
Too much coffee, no coffee.	Llumpay kukata, mana kukata.
First and foremost.	Ñawpaqtaqa, aswan allinqa.
Why do you want to do this.	Imaraykutaq kayta ruwayta munanki.
He just might be.	Payqa chayllaraqmi kanman.
It was a bad night.	Mana allin tutam karqa.
But nobody cares.	Ichaqa manan pipas imananpaschu.
I know you’re too busy not doing it.	Yachanin llumpay ocupasqa kasqaykita mana ruwanaykipaq.
So nobody does it.	Chaymi mana pipas ruwanchu.
He seemed to be caught up in something.	Payqa imapipas hap’isqa hinam karqa.
I didn’t feel tired at all.	Manam ni imapipas sayk’usqa hinachu tarikurqani.
It just sounds like it.	Chayqa uyarikun hinallam.
No, that’s crazy.	Manan, chayqa loco.
Or misbehavior or something else.	Utaq mana allin ruway utaq huk imatapas.
It was there last week.	Chaypin qayna semana karqan.
Three cities please.	Kimsa llaqtaman ama hina kaspa.
And that was smart.	Hinaspa chayqa yachaysapa karqan.
He did it a lot.	Chaytaqa anchatam ruwarqa.
But of course you weren’t.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqanki.
It was a really interesting week.	Chiqamanta sumaq semana karqa.
I can’t stand anyone.	Manam pitapas aguantayta atinichu.
This can be really hard sometimes.	Kayqa chiqap sasa kanman wakin kuti.
They’ve been around for a long time.	Paykunaqa unayñan chaypi kashanku.
But the man had a name.	Ichaqa chay runaqa sutinmi kasqa.
To be quick, you know.	Utqaylla kananpaq, yachanki.
However, it is best to do it yourself.	Ichaqa, qampaq ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
And know what he’s going to do.	Hinaspa yachay ima ruwananta.
Do it regularly.	Sapa kutilla ruway.
I’m going to do it right away.	Ñuqaqa chaylla ruwasaq.
He can no longer be sure what really happened.	Manañan seguro kayta atinchu imachus cheqaqtapuni pasasqanmanta.
I think this is the best he can do.	Kaymi aswan allin ruway atisqanmanta yuyaykuni.
About thirty people were injured.	Yaqa kimsa chunka runakunam k’irisqa karqaku.
Obviously he wasn’t hurt.	Sut’inmi mana k’irisqa karqan.
Now he plans to do just that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwayta yuyaykushan.
He wants to say something, but he can’t.	Imatapas niyta munan, ichaqa manan atinchu.
It will probably be better for you.	Yaqapaschá aswan allin kanqa qanpaq.
He knew where he was now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan maypi kashasqanmanta.
It’s probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá kanqa.
But is that really the case? 	Ichaqa, ¿cheqaqtachu chayna?
But it was a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi karqan.
If not, it’s you.	Mana chayqa, qanmi kanki.
But the man refused to listen.	Ichaqa chay runaqa manan uyariyta munarqanchu.
I thought it was wrong anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
You didn’t know what happened.	Manam yacharqankichu ima pasasqanmanta.
So that’s what it looks like.	Chaymi chayna rikchakun.
In a large building.	Huk hatun wasipi.
That’s right, sadly.	Chayqa allinmi, llakisqa.
I will do that, probably very soon.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq, ichapas ancha utqaylla.
But it was a very tough process.	Ichaqa ancha sinchi ruwaymi karqan.
I’m great with that.	Chaywanmi hatun kani.
But he still couldn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
But something important.	Ichaqa imapas importante kaq.
I feel sure he’ll be back.	Seguro sientekuni kutimunanta.
He was the nicest person last night.	Payqa qayna tutam aswan sumaq runa karqa.
Many indeed were.	Achka chiqaptam chayna karqaku.
This is good for him.	Kayqa allinmi paypaq.
Perhaps he was afraid.	Ichapas mancharisqa tarikurqa.
But we need to act quickly.	Ichaqa chayllam imatapas ruwananchik.
And now they’re ready.	Hinaspa kunan listoña kashanku.
You are not like him.	Qamqa manam pay hinachu kanki.
We are not unhappy about it.	Chaywanqa manam mana kusisqachu kanchik.
Yes, this would be easy.	Arí, kayqa facilmi kanman.
Where are they?.	¿Maypitaq kachkanku?.
The man does it.	Chay runaqa ruwan.
Now it’s nearly a decade later.	Kunanqa yaqa chunka wata qhepamanmi.
I want to be as good a speaker as you are.	Ñuqapas qam hina allin rimaq kaytam munani.
He was very nervous today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi anchata mancharisqa.
They are still the best.	Paykunaqa kunankamapas aswan allinmi.
We are real people.	Chiqap runam kanchik.
Everything is beautiful.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Learn all about him.	Paymanta tukuy imata yachay.
However, the process serves several purposes.	Ichaqa, chay ruwayqa achka ruwaykunata ruwan.
And that was too hard.	Hinaspa chayqa llumpay sinchi karqa.
Almost nothing else can do that.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
That’s something that’s good.	Chayqa imapas allin kaqmi.
Better for him.	Aswan allin paypaq.
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere.	Seguro kani maypipas pakasqa kasqanmanta.
He was not a wise man.	Payqa manam yachaysapa runachu karqa.
And then there is today.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kunan punchawmi kachkan.
He realized he was alone.	Payqa repararqanmi sapallan kasqanmanta.
Now never again.	Kunanqa manaña hayk’aqpas.
You know, the future.	Yachanki, hamuq pacha.
There is more inaction.	Aswan mana ruwaymi kan.
Yeah, it was crazy.	Arí, loco kasqa.
Whatever is easiest for you.	Imapas qampaq aswan facil kaq.
I’m sad and frustrated.	Llakisqa, hukmanyasqa ima kani.
He knew it was a very real thing.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayqa ancha cheqaq ruway kasqanmanta.
This may seem like a good thing.	Kayqa ichapas allinpaq hina kanman.
Yes, it was him.	Arí, paymi karqan.
This is the one here.	Kayqa kaypi kaqmi.
But it's easy for me to say.	Ichaqa facilmi ñuqapaq niyta.
Unfortunately that day is not today.	Llakikuypaqmi chay punchawqa manam kunan punchawchu.
Now, however, it must be.	Kunanmi ichaqa kanan.
One thing I wanted to see here or do here.	Huk imatapas kaypi qawayta utaq kaypi ruwayta munarqani.
I didn’t know that.	Mana chayta yacharqanichu.
But there was one day.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi karqa.
I just did something.	Chayllaraqmi imatapas ruwarqani.
They know and want it anyway.	Paykunaqa yachanku hinaspa imayna kaptinpas munanku.
Be happy, be happy, be good.	Kusisqa kay, kusisqa kay, allin kay.
Then another, bigger one.	Chaymanta huk, aswan hatun.
He couldn’t fix it.	Payqa manan chayta allichayta atirqanchu.
I think everyone was scared.	Yuyaykuni llapa runa mancharisqa kasqankuta.
Go home, boy.	Wasiykiman riy, wayna.
Yes, I know.	Arí yachanim.
He's quite happy about it.	Payqa chaymantaqa allintam kusisqa kachkan.
Maybe there is.	Ichapas kan.
And one to actually do it.	Hinaspa huknin chiqaptapuni ruwananpaq.
There, there, there.	Chaypi, chaypi.
Yeah, it’s absurd, that’s all.	Arí, mana yuyayniyuqmi, chaymi chaylla.
That, however, would be a mistake.	Chayta ruwaymi ichaqa mana allinchu kanman.
Of course, that will never work.	Arí, chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
I was, anyway.	Ñuqaqa karqani, imayna kaptinpas.
That sounds like a lot.	Chayqa anchatam uyarikun.
A couple almost as good as him.	Huk iskay yaqa pay hina allin.
But they disagree.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa acuerdopichu kanku.
No, it wouldn’t be right.	Manan, manan allinchu kanman.
He was always better than me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqamanta aswan allin karqa.
I would love to do that too.	Ñoqapas anchatan munani chayta ruwayta.
Otherwise, it’s still.	Mana chayqa hinallam.
He actually did something.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwarqan.
And there is something.	Hinaspa imapas kachkan.
But that fact doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa chay cheqaq kaqmi mana imapaqpas valenchu.
They seemed very happy.	Paykunaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqaku.
But it's really cold out there right now.	Ichaqa chiqaptam chiri kachkan chay hawapi kunanpacha.
Not so much now.	Mana anchatachu kunanqa.
Just one last time.	Huk qhipa kutilla.
They weren’t like that.	Paykunaqa manan chay hinachu karqanku.
He knows the situation in the country.	Payqa yachanmi chay nacionpi imayna kasqanmanta.
I don’t feel ready for that.	Chaypaqqa manan listochu sientekuni.
If so, you are the only one.	Chayna kaptinqa, qamllam kanki.
They are, they really are.	Paykunaqa kanku, chiqaptam kanku.
It should be very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi kanan.
He did everything right, but he did it right away.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqa, ichaqa chayllam ruwarqa.
He didn’t talk about much of anything.	Payqa manan anchatachu imamantapas rimarqan.
Now, maybe it should be.	Kunanqa, ichapas chayna kanan.
You are here with us.	Qamqa kaypim kachkanki ñuqaykuwan.
I’d be scared.	Mancharisqa kayman.
Nothing seemed difficult.	Manam imapas sasa hinachu karqa.
I'll be there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kasaq.
A crazy one maybe, but .	Huk loco ichapas, ichaqa .
That's good enough for more than one per day.	Chayqa allinmi sapa punchaw hukmanta aswan achka kananpaq.
The whole day went well.	Tukuy punchawmi allinta rirqa.
I can still be sane.	Hinallam allin yuyayniyuq kayta atiyman.
He had no idea how smart they were.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna yachaysapa kasqankuta.
I assume everyone is.	Tukuy runam nispaymi hapini.
At the time, I didn’t really know why.	Chay tiempopiqa manan allintachu yacharqani imarayku chayta.
Today they were.	Kunan punchawmi paykunaqa karqa.
Perhaps you are, too.	Ichapas qampas chayna kanki.
This is easier for me to do.	Kayqa aswan facilmi ñuqapaq ruwayqa.
No matter who they are.	Pikuna kaptinpas.
If anyone has more ideas, please share.	Pipas aswan yuyayniyuq kaptinqa, ama hina kaspa willay.
I know it means a lot to him.	Yachanim paypaq ancha allin kasqanmanta.
It does a lot for you.	Achkatam qampaq ruwan.
He didn't want to say anything.	Payqa mana allintachu rimayta munarqan.
I never heard it so good.	Manam haykapipas chayna allinta uyarirqanichu.
There’s something he wants to ask her.	Chaypin imapas payta tapuyta munan.
Here’s how you can do it .	Kaypi imaynatam ruwawaq .
It’s a bad thing.	Millay kasqanmanta.
If that was good then you’re good.	Sichus chay allin karqan chayqa allinmi kanki.
But I had seen him before.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani.
There is nothing for that.	Chaypaqqa manam imapas kanchu.
It was a very happy day.	Ancha kusisqa punchawmi karqa.
Once later on.	Huk kuti qhepaman.
It was a terribly cold winter there.	Chaypin manchay chiri chiri tiempo karqan.
He doesn't seem happy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu rikchakun.
So he said this statement.	Chaymi kay nisqanta nirqa.
Make a nice exit.	Sumaq lluqsiyta ruway.
I have no ill will towards anyone.	Manam pimanpas millay yuyayniyuqchu kani.
There’s one of them.	Chaypin huknin.
I wonder who’s here.	Tapukuni pikuna kaypi kasqankuta.
He failed here.	Kaypiqa mana allintam ruwarqa.
But now he was there.	Ichaqa kunanmi chaypi kasharqan.
Who is not alone.	Pichus mana sapallanchu.
I can’t talk about it yet.	Manaraqmi chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu.
It was really nice there.	Chiqamanta sumaq karqa chaypi.
Must be angrier.	Aswan phiñasqa kanan tiyan.
I do that one day a week.	Chaytaqa semanapi huk punchawmi ruwani.
Now he has no choice.	Kunanqa manañan ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
I don't know if you know that.	Mana yachanichu chayta yachanki icha manachu.
I can’t find it anymore.	Manañam tarinichu.
Great if, that.	Hatun sichus, chay.
Now, they are anything but.	Kunanqa, paykunaqa imapas ichaqa.
He always knew what he was going to do.	Payqa sapa kutim yacharqa ima ruwananta.
I thought that was the best.	Chayqa aswan allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He didn’t want to rush it.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu chayta ruwayta munarqan.
As usual, he was there for ten days.	Sapa kuti hinam chaypiqa chunka punchaw karqa.
So, it’s funny.	Chaymi, asikunapaq hina.
Less so this time.	Aswan pisi kay kutipi.
He didn’t know he would ever be ready.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’aqllapas listo kananta.
And he gave it to him.	Hinan payqa qorqan.
But I couldn’t find anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas tariyta atirqanichu.
And you're younger than me anyway.	Hinaspa qamqa ñuqamanta sullk'a kanki imayna kaptinpas.
He thought about it for a bit.	Chaypin huk chhikanta yuyaykurqan.
And then he took it.	Hinaspa chaymanta hap’irqan.
He wishes it wasn’t.	Payqa munanmi mana chayna kananta.
Surely it will never happen.	Cheqaqtapunin mana hayk'aqpas chay hinachu kanqa.
Maybe I can fix this.	Ichapas kaymanta allichayta atiyman.
That wasn’t a great success.	Chayqa manan hatun allinchu karqan.
That's kind of great about him, really.	Chayqa huk laya hatunmi paymanta, chiqaptapuni.
Such a young man! 	¡Chayna wayna!
I never knew how wonderful it was.	Mana hayk’aqpas yacharqanichu imayna sumaq kasqanmanta.
That it is the truth.	Chayqa chiqap kaq kasqanmanta.
I have always felt that way.	Sapa kutim chaynata tarikurqani.
People are intelligent.	Runakunaqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
They never had anything like it.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinaqa karqanchu.
Not sure what's wrong with that, if anything.	Mana segurochu ima mana allin kasqanmanta chaymanta, sichus imapas.
Maybe it was just that.	Ichapas chayllaraq karqa.
That person is always you.	Chay runaqa sapa kutim qam kanki.
For what we did together.	Kuska ruwasqaykumanta.
But it is ambiguous.	Ichaqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
I still feel sick.	Hinallam unqusqa hina tarikuni.
I will never be the same.	Manam haykapipas hinachu kasaq.
If you do, that’s fine.	Chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
He actually talked about you.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin qanmanta rimarqan.
He did many things.	Achka ruwaykunata ruwarqa.
The first and the last.	Ñawpaq kaq, qhipa kaq ima.
He never wants to talk.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas rimayta munanchu.
Isn’t that the case?	¿Manachu chayna kanman?
This guy here.	Kay runa kaypi.
I saw no one, heard no one.	Mana pitapas rikurqanichu, mana pitapas uyarirqanichu.
I was so excited and nervous.	Sinchi kusisqa, mancharisqa ima karqani.
He is here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi kachkan.
He was not the easiest man.	Payqa manan aswan facil runachu karqan.
Yes, something seems wrong.	Arí, imapas mana allin hinam kachkan.
He knew he was happily married.	Payqa yacharqanmi kusisqa casarasqa kashasqanmanta.
You said you could buy a house.	Wasi rantiyta atisqaykita nirqanki.
I feel very comfortable in the big city.	Ancha allintam tarikuni hatun llaqtapi.
Couldn't tell why.	Mana willayta atirqachu imarayku.
He doesn’t mean it now.	Payqa manan kunanqa chayta niyta munanchu.
I was a little worried.	Huk chhikantan llakisqa karqani.
Yes, yes, he says.	Arí, arí, nispas nin.
He’s been doing it for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chayta ruwan.
I never really thought about that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu yuyaykurqani.
I always wanted to talk about it.	Sapa kutim chaymanta rimayta munarqani.
I never knew how to swim.	Manam haykapipas nadayta yacharqanichu.
The same thing.	Chay kikin kaq.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allinpaq kanman.
Second day afternoon.	Iskay kaq punchaw tarde.
Today’s reality is much harsher.	Kunan tiempopi cheqaq kaqmi aswan sinchi.
Something about me, maybe.	Imapas ñuqamanta, ichapas.
So, yeah, thank you.	Chaymi, arí, gracias.
No, he said, not quite.	Manan, nispas nin, manan allintachu.
Maybe he was human, maybe he wasn’t.	Ichapas runa karqa, manapaschá.
I don’t really want to talk to him.	Manam chiqaptachu paywan rimayta munani.
Not many things really.	Mana achka imakunatapas chiqaptaqa.
Would it be a good idea.	¿Allinchu kanman chayqa.
But there are two ways to do this.	Ichaqa iskay ruwaymi kanman chayta ruwanapaq.
I was there that terrible night.	Chay manchay tutan chaypi karqani.
He was the first to do so.	Paymi ñawpaq kuti chayta ruwaq.
Wicked, that wasn’t easy.	Millay, chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
It wasn’t good for him, he said.	Manam paypaq allinchu karqa, nispa.
This is what he said.	Kayta nisqa.
He is yours	Payqa qampa .
There’s a lot of pride in it.	Chaypin askha orgulloso kashan.
But this will do for now.	Ichaqa kaymi kunankamaqa allinta ruwanqa.
It would have been hidden there.	Chaypim pakasqa kanman karqa.
I hope it’s as good as the first one.	Suyachkani ñawpaq kaq hina allin kananpaq.
New stuff every day.	Musuq imakuna sapa punchaw.
He is glad he did.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan chayta ruwasqanmanta.
This was never the first time.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas ñawpaq kutichu karqan.
Okay, some stuff.	Allinmi, wakin imakuna.
Now I was him.	Kunanqa paymi karqani.
People, it sounds good.	Runakunam, allinmi uyarikun.
It was almost pathetic.	Yaqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
So he wanted to try something new.	Chaymi huk mosoq kaqta ruwayta munarqa.
No one knows what the future holds.	Manan pipas yachanchu qhepaman imachus kananta.
If you want to ask someone else.	Sichus hukta tapuyta munanki chayqa.
Seriously, do it.	Serio, ruway.
You’re the oldest one.	Qamqa kuraq kaqmi kanki.
He didn’t pay much attention.	Mana anchatachu qhawarisqa.
Everyone is involved.	Tukuy runam chay ruwaypi kachkan.
It was a bad day.	Chayqa mana allin punchawmi karqa.
You know, that kind of thing.	Yachanki, chayna kaqta.
Everything with me was about speed.	Tukuy imapas ñuqawanqa utqaylla kasqanmantam karqa.
One is yes, it always is.	Hukninmi arí, sapa kutim chayna.
But he certainly knew better.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin payqa aswan allinta yacharqan.
This, in fact, really happened.	Kayqa, chiqaptaqa, chiqaptam pasarqa.
I’m serious, do it.	Serio kani, ruway.
Perhaps he would do so.	Yaqapaschá payqa chayta ruwanman.
He is sure of that.	Payqa chaymantaqa segurom kachkan.
He was happy to be almost alone here.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa yaqa sapallan kaypi kasqanmanta.
But it’s wrong, that’s why it’s wrong.	Ichaqa pantasqa, chaymi pantasqa.
He learned a lot about me.	Payqa achkatam ñuqamanta yacharqa.
He wanted to know what was what.	Payqa imachus ima kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
Nothing looked like mine.	Manam imapas ñuqapa hinachu rikchakurqa.
It was just that with me.	Ñuqawanqa chayllam karqa.
Maybe it’s just .	Ichapas chaylla kanman .
I feel hungry again.	Hukmanta yarqaymanta sientekuni.
To avoid duplication.	Mana iskay kutita ruwanapaq.
And it looks really nice.	Hinaspa chiqap sumaq rikchakun.
I am always out there.	Sapa kutim chay hawapi kachkani.
And now they were deeply disappointed.	Hinaspa kunanqa sinchita hukmanyasqa karqanku.
Know what you can do.	Imatachus atisqaykita yachay.
That was a world.	Chayqa karqa huk pacha.
It was a great experience for me there.	Chaypiqa ancha allinmi karqa ñuqapaq.
Unlike before, in the past.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu, ñawpaqpi.
Hopefully this will work out.	Munaymanmi kayqa allin kananpaq.
He goes home alone.	Payqa sapallanmi wasinman rin.
That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allin kanman.
Month two.	Killa iskay.
I think being human is one thing.	Yuyaykuni runa kayqa huk ruwaymi.
He couldn't be here much longer.	Payqa manan aswan unayta kaypi kayta atirqanchu.
Someone knows what the problem is.	Pipas yachanmi ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
No one could sleep.	Manam pipas puñuyta atirqachu.
If he would do that.	Sichus chayta ruwanman chayqa.
I can't look at him now.	Manam kunanqa paytaqa qawayta atiymanchu.
At least not yet, he says.	Aswanpas manaraqmi, nispas nin.
So it was a good thing.	Chaymi allin karqa.
There is, that’s all.	Kanmi, chayllam.
I didn’t really hear anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas uyarirqanichu.
Learn what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta yachay.
He is mostly right.	Payqa yaqa llapanpim allinta rimachkan.
In fact, he may not want to do that.	Aswanpas manapaschá chayta ruwayta munanchu.
And then there is this.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa kaymi kachkan.
He was with me almost every day.	Payqa yaqa sapa punchawmi ñuqawan karqa.
Then, you did it.	Chaymanta, qamqa ruwarqanki.
We have a good idea who that is.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi kayku pichus chay kasqanmanta.
And that’s not like him.	Hinaspa chayqa manan pay hinachu.
I was a little disappointed and a little excited.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan hukmanyasqa hinaspa huk chikan kusisqa karqani.
In fact, they disagreed.	Aswanpas manan acuerdopichu karqanku.
I'm still worried.	Hinallam llakisqa kachkani.
He was later arrested.	Qhepamanmi hap’isqa karqan.
You’re like crazy.	Loco hinam kanki.
He was a nice nice guy.	Payqa sumaq sumaq runam karqa.
But I couldn’t stand it.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa aguantayta atirqanichu.
We may not be able to see why and what it is.	Ichapas mana qawayta atichwanchu imanasqa kasqanmanta hinaspa imakuna kasqanmanta.
Time, time, time.	Tiempo, tiempo, tiempo.
Of course, he couldn’t do that.	Arí, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Again, as always.	Yapamanta, sapa kuti hina.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I really want to know about him.	Anchatan paymanta yachayta munani.
He is much better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi kachkan.
Serious talker.	Serio rimaq.
I had to do that all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanay karqa.
But now is the best time to talk.	Ichaqa kunanmi aswan allinqa rimanaypaq.
That doesn’t mean he’s innocent.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana huchayoq kasqanmanta.
Not so bad now.	Mana chayna mana allinchu kunanqa.
Probably someone was there.	Yaqapaschá pipas chaypiqa karqa.
Nothing made any sense.	Manam imapas imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
He was the one who was.	Payqa chayna kasqa.
He has absolutely no reason to.	Payqa manan imaraykupas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Who knows how long this season.	Pi yachan hayka unayta kay pacha.
This is where it all happened.	Kaypim tukuy imapas pasarqa.
Do what you want at home.	Wasipi munasqaykita ruway.
You have to do it accordingly.	Chayman hinam chaytaqa ruwanayki.
We can't take this anymore.	Manañam kayta hapiyta atichwanchu.
I would be foolish by now.	Kunankamaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kayman.
But he has to be.	Ichaqa paymi kanan.
You know, it was really nice talking to you.	Yachanki, chiqap sumaqmi karqa qanwan rimayqa.
People were frustrated and sad.	Runakunaqa hukmanyasqa hinaspa llakisqa karqaku.
I really wanted to be there for him.	Anchatam munarqani paypaq chaypi kayta.
There was a lot of time there.	Chaypin askha tiempo karqan.
You can’t win that way.	Chay hinaqa manan atipayta atiwaqchu.
Dismissed for serious misconduct.	Sinchi mana allin ruwasqanmanta qarqusqa.
Therefore and .	Chayraykum hinaspa .
So he does everything right.	Chaymi tukuy imatapas allinta ruwan.
Yes, that sounds pretty amazing.	Arí, chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi uyarikun.
I will continue to do so now.	Kunanqa hinallam ruwasaq.
And he was half scared.	Hinaspa kuskan mancharisqa kasqa.
Yeah, right, man.	Arí, allinmi, runa.
Nothing could have been more lonely.	Manan imapas aswan sapallanchu kanman karqan.
It was a long time ago, he said.	Unayñam karqa, nispa.
Location is important.	Maypi kayqa ancha allinmi.
Yes this is it.	Arí kayqa.
He was a busy man, after all.	Payqa ocupasqa runan karqan, tukuy imamanta.
He knows who you are.	Payqa yachanmi pi kasqaykita.
I mean, the weather.	Niyta munani, pacha.
He obviously knows that.	Sut’inmi chaytaqa yachan.
Not me, but something .	Mana ñuqachu, aswanpas imapas .
You can’t get away with it.	Manam chaymantaqa lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
I’ve known that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñam yachani.
I don’t want to play.	Manam pukllayta munanichu.
No one wants to.	Manam pipas munanchu.
One didn’t think any better of it.	Hukninmi mana aswan allintachu chaypi yuyaykurqan.
She is as beautiful as you are.	Payqa qan hina ancha sumaqmi.
I didn’t know how to handle it.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna hapiyta.
I have no idea where it went.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani mayman risqanmanta.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day.	Ichapas paqarin, ichapas paqarin punchaw.
I enjoy swimming.	Kusikuni nadayta.
He had always done so.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaytaqa ruwaq.
I was never able to catch it, unfortunately.	Manam haykapipas hapiyta atirqanichu, llakikuypaqmi.
Something almost.	Imapas yaqa.
He doesn’t even want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwaytapas munanchu.
He will always be here for me.	Payqa sapa kutim kaypi kanqa ñuqapaq.
And then there you were.	Hinaspa chaymanta chaypi karqanki.
That’s what I’m most worried about.	Chaymantam astawan llakikuni.
He is such a good teacher.	Payqa chayna allin yachachiqmi.
Difficult week for me.	Sasa semana ñuqapaq.
You’re a strong girl.	Sinchi sipasmi kanki.
He didn’t seem upset at all.	Payqa manan imapipas phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
He would have continued.	Payqa hinallam kanman karqa.
He’s a child.	Payqa wawa.
What is the moment that.	Imataq chay rato chay.
It’s just not very good.	Chaylla mana ancha allinchu.
I don’t think about it at all.	Manam ni imapipas piensanichu.
And this is every day.	Hinaspa kayqa sapa punchawmi.
Everything is easier there.	Chaypiqa tukuy imapas aswan facilmi.
There was really nothing in the city.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas karqachu chay llaqtapiqa.
But it doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
We are usually very happy about it.	Yaqa llapanpim chaymantaqa ancha kusisqa kanchik.
And, today was the day.	Hinaspa, kunan punchawmi punchaw karqa.
No, it's not	Manan, manan .
He did nothing, said nothing.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu, manan imatapas nirqanchu.
I probably didn’t do that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He's really drunk.	Payqa chiqaptam machasqa kachkan.
I feel so much better now.	Kunanqa anchatan allinta sientekuni.
They were surprisingly good.	Paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi allin karqaku.
It just surfaced.	Chayllaraqmi hawaman lluqsirqa.
This was not a man.	Kayqa manam runachu karqa.
It would be very good in fact.	Ancha allinmi kanman chiqaptaqa.
I’m not a stupid person.	Manam sonso runachu kani.
He wanted to be here, there, everywhere.	Payqa kaypi, chaypi, maypipas kaytam munarqa.
But do something more.	Ichaqa aswan imatapas ruway.
And if you want one, you better hurry.	Hinaspa hukta munanki chayqa, aswan allinmi usqhaylla ruwanayki.
Yes, you can’t.	Arí, manan atiwaqchu.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Chayqa manan mana allin ruwaychu ni imapipas.
What a great night.	Ima hatun tutam.
You want her to know how she feels.	Munanki imayna sientekusqanmanta yachananta.
This guy had to be crazy.	Kay runaqa loco kanan karqa.
Don’t ever like that.	Ama hayk’aqpas chaytaqa gustanchu.
So he was out there, somewhere.	Chaymi payqa chay hawapi kasqa, maypipas.
I want to stay for a while.	Huk rato qhepakuyta munani.
Maybe tomorrow would be better.	Ichapas paqarin aswan allin kanman.
So you have to do it for him.	Chaymi paypaq ruwanayki.
This is what it’s all about.	Kaymi tukuy imapas kachkan.
Maybe now.	Ichapas kunanqa.
I think something will happen in the future.	Yuyaykuni hamuq tiempopi imapas pasananta.
It probably will anyway.	Yaqapaschá imayna kaptinpas kanqa.
I am a man of intelligence.	Yuyayniyuq runam kani.
Something happened last night.	Qayna tutam imapas pasarqa.
Very handsome, and very rich.	Ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq, hinaspa ancha qhapaq.
I am very, very happy about it.	Ancha ancha kusisqam kachkani chaymanta.
I never thought it would happen so soon.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chaylla chayna kananta.
Yeah, that was me.	Arí, chaymi ñoqa karqani.
And then home, .	Hinaspa chaymanta wasi, .
He hadn’t done that in a long time.	Payqa unayñan mana chaytachu ruwarqan.
I was pretty serious.	Ñuqaqa allin serio karqani.
I don’t believe in that either.	Ñoqapas manan chaypiqa creenichu.
It may not last long.	Manapaschá unaytachu kanqa.
I want you to have some ideas.	Munani wakin yuyayniyuq kanaykita.
They were immediately expelled.	Chayllam qarqusqa karqaku.
I didn’t think he would ever find out.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu hayk’aqllapas chayta yachananta.
Nothing is certain here.	Mana imapas kaypi segurochu.
He had no choice but to do it.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu, aswanpas chaytan ruwanan karqan.
He came out here.	Kayman lluqsirqa.
Maybe it’s like a teacher.	Ichapas yachachiq hina kanman.
He's fine tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa allinmi kachkan.
Now, however, it was.	Kunanmi ichaqa chayna karqa.
Maybe share it with him.	Ichapas chayta paywan willay.
But I have an idea.	Ichaqa huk yuyayniyuqmi kani.
Okay, a little bit.	Allinmi, huk chikan.
Wasn’t it great.	Manachu hatun karqa.
More on that another time.	Astawan chaymanta huk kutipi.
I wanted to help him.	Payta yanapayta munarqani.
In fact, he was pretty sure of that.	Aswanpas chaymantaqa allintan seguro kasharqan.
But the truth is no one knows.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi mana pipas yachanchu.
You certainly can’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana atiwaqchu.
Everyone in this city has an opinion.	Kay llaqtapiqa llapa runam huk yuyayniyuq.
Maybe that’s the best way.	Ichapas chayna aswan allinqa.
He’s not really like that.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna kashan.
We're not really here anyway.	Manam chiqaptachu kaypi kachkaniku imayna kaptinpas.
But I really like it.	Ichaqa anchatan gustan.
That was a really big deal.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ancha hatun ruway karqan.
But that probably doesn't matter.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa mana imananpaschu.
No one knows all about it.	Manan pipas tukuy chaymantaqa yachanchu.
Seriously, go do it right now.	Serio, riy kunanpacha ruway.
I’ve been thinking about this all night.	Tukuy tutan kaypi yuyaykushani.
You were there one day.	Huk punchawmi chaypi karqanki.
Something went wrong.	Imapas mana allintam rirqa.
I thought it might be home.	Yuyarqanim wasi kanman nispa.
I think .	Ñoqaqa yuyaykuni .
Would you like to work with us?.	¿Ñuqaykuwan llamk'ayta munankichu?.
How I was surprised.	Imaynatan admirakurqani.
I don’t want anything to happen.	Manam munanichu imapas pasananta.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna pasananta.
Maybe he was one of them.	Ichapas payqa huknin karqa.
They are very good at it.	Paykunaqa ancha allinmi chaypiqa.
Who does that?!.	¿Pitaq chayta ruwan?!.
Don’t be me.	Ama ñuqa kaychu.
They were so terrified.	Chayna mancharisqa karqaku.
He knew who this was.	Payqa yacharqanmi pichus kay kasqanmanta.
They’re tired of it.	Paykunaqa sayk’usqa kanku.
Ideally, he would be here tonight.	Allin kaptinqa kunan tutam kaypi kanman karqa.
And one for me.	Hinaspa hukta ñuqapaq.
He had been there before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi chaypi karqa.
There is, but there isn’t.	Kanmi, ichaqa manan kanchu.
That is why you are here today.	Chayraykum kunan punchaw kaypi kachkanki.
Yes he does, somewhat.	Arí payqa ruwan, huk chhikanta.
But he’s always there.	Ichaqa payqa sapa kutillanmi chaypi kashan.
This can be good or this can be bad.	Kayqa allin kanman utaq kayqa mana allin kanman.
He immediately began to fix it.	Chayllam allichayta qallaykurqa.
Mary was a great guy.	Mariaqa hatunmi karqa.
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chaytaqa ruwarqa.
This all happened so fast, you know.	Kay tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam pasarqa, yachanki.
You don’t know you’re in the process.	Mana yachankichu chay ruwaypi kasqaykita.
I couldn’t stand it, not yet.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu, manaraqmi.
I was very curious.	Anchatam yachayta munarqani.
This is great as always.	Kayqa hatunmi sapa kuti hina.
But it was a good night.	Ichaqa chay tutaqa allinmi karqan.
We’re not good enough yet.	Manaraqmi allinchu kayku.
Yes, he is a he.	Arí, payqa huk paymi.
No one was sane.	Manam pipas allin yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
So that’s tough, man.	Chaymi chayqa sinchi, runa.
He is always frustrated.	Payqa sapa kutim hukmanyasqa tarikun.
Maybe it will, maybe it won’t.	Ichapas chayna kanqa, ichapas mana kanqachu.
I don’t remember it now.	Manam kunanqa yuyarinichu.
He wanted to ask someone about it.	Payqa chaymantam pitapas tapuyta munarqa.
Okay, that’s better.	Allinmi, chayqa aswan allinmi.
I like it anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas gustanmi.
You can’t take a chance.	Manan atiwaqchu huk oportunidadta hap’iyta.
He doesn't know much about what happened there.	Chaypi imakuna pasasqanmantaqa manam anchatachu yachan.
No, it’s a human being.	Manan, huk runan.
Then two months.	Chaymanta iskay killa.
You have the ability to.	Qamqa kanmi chay.
They know you were there that night.	Chay tuta chaypi kasqaykita yachanku.
The first one is easier.	Ñawpaq kaqmi aswan facil.
First summer with it.	Ñawpaq kaq verano chaywan.
It was with me.	Ñoqawanmi karqan.
So tired after that day.	Chay hina sayk’usqa chay p’unchay qhepaman.
I wanted better.	Aswan allintam munarqani.
But they were crazy.	Ichaqa loco karqanku.
No one repeats anything.	Manam pipas imatapas yapamanta ruwanchu.
He checked it now.	Payqa kunanmi chayta qhawarirqan.
I felt crazy.	Loco hinam tarikurqani.
He went with us.	Paymi ñuqaykuwan rirqa.
But ultimately that doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi chayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa.
Better yet, if he can make her .	Aswan allinqa, sichus payta ruwayta atinman chayqa .
That doesn’t mean you can’t.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana atisqaykita.
But now it is very difficult.	Ichaqa kunanmi ancha sasa.
And he did a terrible job.	Hinaspa manchay llamkayta ruwarqa.
Nothing, at least tonight.	Mana imapas kanchu, aswanpas kunan tutamanta.
He will not be happy.	Payqa manam kusisqachu kanqa.
No one is really good now.	Kunanqa manam pipas chiqaptaqa allinchu.
I don’t think he should be alone here.	Manam yuyanichu sapallan kaypi kananta.
I couldn't believe it.	Chaykunataqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
Something happened to him to be like this.	Imapas paywan pasarqa kayna kananpaq.
The action must be taken now.	Kunanmi ruwayqa kanan.
One of them opened the door.	Hukninmi punkuta kicharirqa.
Most of the time, people are not very good.	Yaqa llapanpim runakunaqa mana ancha allinchu kanku.
Obviously you don’t want this.	Sut’inmi mana kayta munankichu.
Very, very tired indeed.	Ancha, ancha sayk’usqa hina chiqap.
That would be a nice thing to do, he thought.	Chay ruwayqa sumaq ruwaymi kanman, nispan yuyaykurqan.
This is not the case here.	Kayqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
If not, do it there.	Mana chayqa, chaypi ruway.
He knew he had exactly what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi allinta imachus munasqanman hina kashasqanmanta.
A first for me, to be sure.	Huk ñawpaq ñuqapaq, seguro kanaypaq.
He can’t swim.	Mana nadayta atinchu.
He shouldn’t be there.	Payqa manan chaypichu kanan.
Things were still worse.	Hinallam imapas aswan mana allinqa karqa.
He was very proud of it.	Payqa ancha orgulloso kasharqan chaymanta.
I’m sorry, but that’s not right.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
And he’s crazy.	Hinaspa payqa loco.
Otherwise it would make things worse.	Mana chayqa aswan mana allintan ruwanman.
So there is no name.	Chaymi mana sutin kanchu.
It didn't get any better than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan allinchu karqa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Chayna kaptinqa mana allinchu.
He doesn’t know anything about it yet.	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa imatapas yachanchu.
Here, you are the one.	Kaypi, qamqa kanki.
Sad, very sad.	Llakisqa, ancha llakisqa.
You said no reason.	Mana imaraykupas nirqanki.
Ideally, all year round.	Allinmi kanman, tukuy wata.
The treasures there are vast.	Chaypi kaq qhapaq kaykunaqa ancha hatunmi.
All the time'	Tukuy tiempo'.
He didn’t think he ever would.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu hayk’aqpas chayta ruwananta.
Learn everything about it.	Chaymanta tukuy imata yachay.
I never knew that was the case.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
The teacher and the child.	Yachachiq hinaspa wawa.
That’s if that’s the case.	Chayqa chayna kaptinqa.
He certainly would.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanman.
I had to do something new.	Musuq kaqta ruwanay karqa.
A while ago now.	Huk pacha ñawpaqta kunan.
And that’s what you do every day.	Hinaspa chaytaqa sapa p’unchaymi ruwanki.
But nothing was right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu kasqa.
That you are not disappointed.	Mana hukmanyasqa kasqaykita.
Anything here in the city.	Imapas kaypi llaqtapi.
He would talk to her in the morning.	Paqarinmi paywan rimaq.
I can’t wait to ride the bike properly though.	Mana suyayta atinichu allinta bicicletapi puriyta ichaqa.
This statement is not correct.	Kay rimayqa manam allinchu.
The travelers know that.	Chaytaqa puriq runakunam yachanku.
Okay, maybe a few.	Allinmi, ichapas huk iskay kimsa.
Every building was difficult.	Sapa wasi ruwaymi sasa karqa.
But it’s very bad.	Ichaqa ancha mana allinmi.
I wanted to hear it cold and hard.	Chiri, sinchi uyariyta munarqani.
I think it’s really good.	Chiqap allin kasqanmantam piensani.
After that, do the second step.	Chay qhepamanmi iskay kaq llank’ayta ruway.
It was a world first.	Chayqa karqan kay pachapi ñawpaq kutita.
Yes, that is ridiculous.	Arí, chayqa asikunapaq hinam.
Now this is not a good thing.	Kunanqa kayqa mana allinchu.
But he was the crowd, really.	Ichaqa paymi karqan chay askha runakuna, cheqaqtapuni.
You’re doing all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruwachkanki.
He has always been like that.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna karqan.
I still haven’t been able to.	Kunankamapas manam atirqanichu.
I don’t think so.	Chaynataqa manam piensanichu.
I know it's day, it's night.	Yachanim punchaw kasqanmanta, tuta kasqanmanta.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañan kanchu.
In the past.	Ñawpaqpi.
I never think about it.	Manam haykapipas chaypiqa piensanichu.
Rather, it is a constant process.	Aswanpas sapa kuti ruwaymi.
Who can tell.	Pitaq willayta atinman.
He was a mentally ill man.	Payqa yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I can't say that for sure.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu niyta atiyman.
This is actually pretty bad.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa ancha mana allinmi.
It was almost always.	Yaqapaschá sapa kutilla karqan.
I felt ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam tarikurqani.
We are a larger crowd.	Aswan hatun achka runakunam kanchik.
And, he continues to do so.	Hinaspa, hinallam ruwachkan.
Herein lies the real problem.	Kaypim chiqap sasachakuy kachkan.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Ñoqa ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna ruwayta.
What a great guy.	Ima hatun wayna.
He always gave her one.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi hukta qorqan.
Everyone is very smart.	Lliwmi ancha yachaysapa.
He wanted her to come soon.	Payqa munarqanmi chaylla hamunanta.
Every month insurance.	Sapa killa seguro.
It was always difficult.	Sapa kutim sasa karqa.
That’s as simple as can be.	Chayqa atisqanman hina facilmi.
I did a lot of it.	Achkatam ruwarqani.
I don’t believe it’s evil.	Manam creenichu millay kasqanta.
He was afraid of her.	Paymanta mancharisqa.
To a back room.	Huk qhipa wasiman.
Everyone was excited about it.	Lliwmi chaymanta kusisqa karqaku.
He’s no one very happy with me.	Payqa manan pipas ancha kusisqachu ñoqawanqa.
Most people are here.	Kaypiqa yaqa llapan runakunam kachkan.
They really mean it.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam chayta niyta munanku.
He had to do something about it.	Chaypaqqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He couldn’t handle being alone all the time.	Payqa manan tukuy tiempo sapallan kaytaqa hap’iyta atirqanchu.
Maybe the worst is yet to come.	Ichapas aswan mana allinqa hamunqa.
After that, he wasn’t quite sure.	Chay qhepamanmi mana allintachu seguro kasharqan.
I’m really really tired now.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta kunan sayk’usqa kachkani.
Yes, now and then.	Arí, kunan chaymanta.
I had never lived in another city.	Manam haykapipas huk llaqtapiqa yacharqanichu.
It’s the same type of thing.	Chayqa kikin laya kaqmi.
But not everything went smoothly.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas allintachu rirqan.
I really want something else.	Huk imatapas anchatam munani.
He did the same thing again.	Chaynatam yapamanta ruwarqa.
That should be the last step.	Chayqa qhipa kaq ruwaymi kanan.
I can do it well.	Allinta ruwayta atiyman.
Like every year.	Sapa wata hina.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawanqa.
He doesn’t care, but he knows.	Manam imananpaschu, ichaqa yachanmi.
I'm sorry about that.	Chayna kasqanmantam llakikuni.
Sure you do.	Seguro ruwanki.
And they were all busy.	Hinan llapallanku ocupasqa karqanku.
If so, that’s what you do.	Chayna kaptinqa, chaytam ruwanki.
Maybe with him.	Ichapas paywan kuska.
Or less.	Utaq pisi.
Never ever, ever.	Mana hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas.
That’s not going to get any easier.	Chayqa manan aswan facilchu kanqa.
Nothing else, nothing more.	Mana imapas huk, mana imapas aswan.
Before, it always was.	Ñawpaqtaqa sapa kutim karqan.
It’s extremely cruel here.	Kaypiqa sinchi millay ruwaymi.
He couldn't stop her.	Payqa manan hark'ayta atirqanchu.
Why, a world.	Imarayku, huk pacha.
If you do, it will be great.	Chayta ruwaspaqa hatunmi kanqa.
I had a really good day too.	Ñuqapas chiqap allin punchawmi karqani.
I can be pretty angry.	Allin phiñasqa kayta atiyman.
I didn’t have much time.	Manam ancha tiempoy karqachu.
Okay, so this is new.	Allinmi, chaymi kayqa musuq.
The result was even more impressive.	Chay ruwasqanqa aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Something about him.	Paymanta imapas.
There are good people here.	Kaypiqa allin runakunam kachkan.
But no, it was something else.	Ichaqa manan, huk ruwaymi karqan.
That alone is the worst thing in the world.	Chayqa sapallanmi kay pachapi aswan mana allin kaq.
Now I’m excited about it.	Kunanqa chaymanta kusisqa kachkani.
And he spoke.	Hinan payqa rimarqan.
The first is that it is not immediate.	Ñawpaq kaqmi mana chayllachu.
But he knows why.	Ichaqa yachanmi imanasqa chayta.
I can’t understand that at all.	Chaytaqa manan imapipas entiendeyta atiymanchu.
The success was absurd.	Chay allin ruwasqanqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I didn’t know what it was like though.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kasqanmanta ichaqa.
He died three weeks later.	Chaymanta kinsa semana qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
Wrong, it seems.	Pantasqa, rikchakun.
I can’t tell you his name.	Manam sutinta willayta atiymanchu.
The process was not so easy.	Chay ruwayqa manan chhayna facilchu karqan.
If not, then it’s fine.	Mana chayqa, chaymantaqa allinmi.
You’re tired.	Sayk’usqa kanki.
He was a little annoyed.	Payqa huk chhikantan phiñasqa kasharqan.
One cup of coffee at a time.	Hukmanta huk kukata.
He couldn't come.	Payqa manam hamuyta atirqachu.
I couldn’t figure out the problem.	Manam chay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
A lot of that is out there in the air.	Achka chaymanta hawapi hawapi.
I couldn’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam atirqanichu.
I’m already doing this.	Ñam kayta ruwachkani.
I did nothing with it.	Chaywanqa manam imatapas ruwarqanichu.
But they have always been.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqaku.
He wasn’t there as usual.	Payqa manan sapa kuti hinachu chaypi kasharqan.
I mean, that’s absurd.	Niyta munani, chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Will do it again.	Hukmanta ruwanqa.
He couldn’t go there.	Chaymanqa manam riyta atirqachu.
Which is like it should be.	Imataq kanan hina.
Do it right now.	Kunanpacha ruway.
These people are	Kay runakunaqa .
And that wouldn’t do him any good.	Hinaspa chayqa manan allintachu ruwanman.
I’m really worried, actually.	Chiqamanta llakisqa kachkani, chiqamanta.
You really don't want to work on it.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaypi llamkayta munankichu.
You think it’s ugly.	Qamqa millay kananpaqmi yuyanki.
Never ready in time.	Mana hayk’aqpas tiempollanpi listochu.
Maybe for no reason at all.	Ichapas mana imaraykupas ni imaraykupas.
I never wanted to do anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwayta munarqanichu.
But this would be doing nothing.	Ichaqa kayqa mana imatapas ruwaymi kanman.
He realized that it was.	Payqa repararqanmi chay hina kasqanmanta.
Do that with me.	Ruway chayta ñuqawan.
I just wanted to make sure.	Chayllam seguro kayta munarqani.
I never thought it would get caught.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chay hapisqa kananta.
I'd rather not be.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana kayqa.
You know, this one time.	Yachanki, kay huk kutilla.
We have been together for so long.	Chayna unayñam kuska kachkaniku.
Otherwise, it’s great.	Mana chayqa, hatunmi.
Half of him, anyway.	Kuskan paymanta, imayna kaptinpas.
But you just told him to do whatever he wanted.	Ichaqa chaylla nirqanki ima munasqantapas ruwananpaq.
But now everything is as it should be.	Ichaqa kunanmi tukuy imapas kanan hina kashan.
He said he was sure it was me.	Payqa nirqam ñuqa kasqaymanta seguro kasqanmanta.
Where was he all last year.	Maypitaq tukuy qayna wata karqa.
If one fails, there is another.	Huknin mana allintachu ruwan chayqa, hukninmi kan.
I would be really good at that.	Chaypiqa chiqaptam allin kayman.
It’s hard to overstate this.	Kayta llumpayta rimayqa sasam.
But, maybe it’s for the best.	Ichaqa, ichapas aswan allinpaq kanman.
I felt like a kid again.	Hukmanta wawa hinam tarikurqani.
I am a human being too.	Ñuqapas huk runam kani.
That’s later.	Qhepamanmi chayqa.
Where does he go.	Mayman rin.
The first one is easy.	Ñawpaq kaqmi facil.
But this had to happen.	Ichaqa kaymi kanan karqan.
Easy, he wanted to say.	Mana sasachu, nispas niyta munarqa.
And you know, it’s not really up to me.	Hinaspa yachanki, manan cheqaqtachu ñoqamanta kanqa.
Everything is instructive.	Tukuy imapas yachachiqmi.
Can't solve the problem.	Mana chay sasachakuy allichayta atinchu.
I’m not this one.	Manam kaychu kani.
It might have been half an hour.	Yaqapaschá kuskan hora kanman karqan.
But he is still doing something.	Ichaqa hinallam imatapas ruwachkan.
So it was black.	Chaymi yana karqa.
They are very ambiguous.	Paykunaqa ancha iskay yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
In fact, we already are.	Chiqaptaqa, ñam chayna kanchik.
He doesn’t know how to handle this.	Payqa manan yachanchu kayta imayna allichayta.
I always wanted it.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa munarqani.
She’ll be a girl.	Sipasmi kanqa.
Do what you can do.	Imatapas ruway atisqaykita ruway.
He was indeed trapped.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin hap’isqa kasharqan.
I was rather disappointed that it never happened.	Aswan hukmanyasqa karqani mana haykapipas chayna kasqanmanta.
That’s how we lived.	Chaynatam tiyaq kayku.
They meant a lot to me today.	Paykunaqa kunan punchawmi ñuqapaq ancha allin karqa.
Who is she, she thinks.	Pitaq payqa, nispas yuyaykun.
No, he said, he'd rather not.	Manan, nispas nin, aswan allinmi kanman mana.
Both were innocent.	Iskayninkum mana huchayoq karqaku.
Nobody wants to see that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas qawayta munanchu.
This is a real person.	Kayqa chiqap runam.
There’s always a chance.	Sapa kutim kan chansa.
I'm probably there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi kachkani.
This looks interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
This can be very easy.	Kayqa ancha facilmi kanman.
I’m still going to be there.	Ñuqaqa hinallam kachkani.
But no one was there.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaypiqa karqanchu.
That got him kicked out.	Chaywanmi qarqusqa karqa.
It was easier without it.	Mana chaywanqa aswan facilmi karqa.
He was, several times.	Payqa karqan, askha kutita.
So not sure if it should or not.	Chaymi mana segurochu kananmanta icha manachu.
But he is not here now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa kaypichu kashan.
It’s about this.	Kaymanta riman.
I probably went there last summer.	Yaqapaschá qayna verano chayman rirqani.
Then we would walk away.	Chaymantaqa puriq kayku.
But there was something more important than that.	Ichaqa chaymanta aswan importante kaqmi karqan.
Very late in the night.	Ancha tarde tutamanta.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñam karqa.
I mean really, really good.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta allin niyta munani.
He asked a lot of questions.	Payqa anchatan tapurqan.
We cannot be sure of this.	Kaymantaqa manam seguro kayta atichwanchu.
But perhaps that is the worst part.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chay hinaqa aswan mana allinqa.
It’s like something new.	Imapas musuq kaq hinam.
The most important thing came.	Aswan importante kaqmi hamurqan.
Rather like a fool, really.	Aswanpas sonso hina, chiqap.
It came hard and fast.	Sinchita hinaspa utqaylla hamurqa.
You are not happy with me.	Manam ñuqawanqa kusisqachu kachkanki.
I am still a human being.	Kunankamapas runam kani.
But first things first.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ñawpaqtaqa.
He had a very nice conversation with her.	Paywan ancha sumaq rimayta ruwarqa.
I wish I had a good time with him.	Munaymanmi paywan allinta rimayta.
He went through too much today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi llumpayta pasarqa.
I think he is something else.	Payqa huk imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
Both would be great.	Iskayninkum ancha allin kanman.
I don't really know how to properly address this problem.	Manam allintachu yachani imaynatam kay sasachakuymanta allinta rimayta.
We’re very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kayku.
It’s not worth it.	Manas imapaqpas valenchu.
Learn what he knows.	Ima yachasqanmanta yachay.
He certainly seems to act quickly on it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa usqhaylla imatapas ruwanman hina.
The truth is, no one does.	Chiqap kaqmi, manam pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Good, bad or ugly.	Allin, mana allin utaq millay.
There is a time for everything.	Tukuy imapaqpas kanmi tiempo.
He was obviously upset now.	Payqa sut’inmi kunanqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manan mana allin ruwaychu.
He says it's not good.	Mana allinchu nispa nin.
I did everything for you.	Tukuy imatam qampaq ruwarqani.
You don’t know why.	Manam yachankichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
He knew what this was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus kay kasqanmanta.
I wouldn’t be happy if you didn’t.	Mana kusisqachu kayman mana chayta ruwaptikiqa.
I’m alone in myself.	Sapallanmi kani.
That would have a negative effect.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwanman.
The result is a very interesting one.	Chayna ruwasqanqa ancha sumaqmi.
Man means people.	Runaqa runakuna niyta munan.
Learn more about it here.	Astawan chaymanta kaypi yachay.
Everyone seems so happy.	Lliwmi ancha kusisqa hina kanku.
That was not a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa mana allinchu karqa.
You’ve done it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqanki.
Now it was all day, every day.	Kunanqa tukuy punchaw, sapa punchawmi karqa.
In fact, he is no longer there.	Aswanpas manañan kanchu.
I didn’t do this.	Manam kaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
He couldn't tell what it was like.	Payqa manam yachayta atirqachu imayna kasqanmanta.
Yes, indeed he did.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin payqa ruwarqan.
In fact, it is nowhere to be found now.	Chiqaptaqa manam maypipas kunanqa kanchu.
And that’s what you did.	Hinaspa chayta ruwarqanki.
A really bad guy, in every sense of the word.	Chiqap millay runa, tukuy imapipas.
There are no new people.	Manam musuq runakunaqa kanchu.
But it will be very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
They were very angry.	Paykunaqa anchatan phiñasqa karqanku.
He was sure of it.	Payqa seguro kasqa chaymanta.
It was a really great day.	Chiqaptam hatun punchaw karqa.
A lot of people are not very happy about this.	Achka runakunam mana ancha kusisqachu kaymanta.
That should be the whole time.	Chayqa tukuy tiempon kanan.
He cannot eat during that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan mikhunata atinchu.
There is no reason.	Manam kanchu imarayku.
I don’t want to see him.	Manam paytaqa rikuyta munanichu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam mana allinqa kanchu.
He doesn’t seem worried.	Payqa manan llakisqa hinachu kashan.
This afternoon, that happened.	Kunan tarde, chaymi pasarqa.
You can’t not, it’s not like this.	Manan mana atiwaqchu, manan kay hinachu.
Actually, not much.	Chiqamanta, mana anchatachu.
I thought it was too much.	Llumpay llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Great to be here again.	Ancha allinmi hukmanta kaypi kayqa.
So far things are interesting.	Kunankamaqa imapas sumaqmi.
Don’t do what you want to do.	Ama ruway munasqaykita ruwaychu.
This guy is a real guy.	Kay runaqa chiqap runam.
It was a long night ago.	Chay tutaqa unayñan kasqa.
I’m not going to do that.	Manan chaytaqa ruwasaqchu.
There is no second option.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa manam kanchu.
He does the hard work.	Payqa sinchita llamk’ayta ruwan.
He is an important man.	Payqa importante runan.
He looked at the tip.	Payqa chay puntata qhawarisqa.
So, that’s about half the problem.	Chaymi, chaymi kuskan sasachakuymanta riman.
You have been depressed for a long time.	Unayñan llakisqa kashanki.
I want to hear you say that.	Chayta nisqaykita uyariyta munani.
I didn’t want him.	Paytaqa mana munarqanichu.
Okay, sort of.	Allinmi, huk laya.
That’s what you’re doing.	Chayta ruwasqaykita.
That’s not going to be any good.	Chayqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
You can't get hold of things.	Manan imakunatapas hap'iyta atiwaqchu.
But no one thought of it.	Ichaqa manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu.
Everything about it.	Tukuy ima chaymanta.
And then you never know.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana haykapipas yachankichu.
If you’re hungry.	Yarqasqa kanki chayqa.
Instead, he .	Aswanpas payqa .
This would be the first.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaqmi kanman.
You never know what he's going to do.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu ima ruwananta.
I know it's like crazy coming from me.	Yachanim ñuqamanta hamuq loco hina kasqanmanta.
This went on and on.	Kayqa hinallam rirqa.
I have no idea what is wrong now.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani kunan ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I don’t need them, after all.	Manam chaykunataqa necesitasaqchu, tukuy imamanta.
He eats a lot of it.	Achkatam mikun.
So tell the truth accurately.	Chaymi cheqaq kaqta allinta willay.
Better to try it once and do it right.	Aswan allinmi huk kutilla ruway hinaspa allinta ruway.
I could never stop thinking.	Manam haykapipas yuyaymanayta saqiyta atirqanichu.
You are safer here.	Kaypiqa aswan segurom kanki.
Nothing was like it is now.	Manan imapas kunan hinachu karqan.
About two years ago.	Yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqta.
Don’t be unsure about this.	Ama kaymanta mana seguro kaychu.
Every day is something new.	Sapa punchawmi imapas musuq.
They were famous people.	Paykunaqa riqsisqa runakunam karqaku.
He couldn’t finish the conversation.	Manas rimayta tukuyta atirqachu.
But perhaps that is the case.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa kanman.
I probably won’t be there.	Manapaschá chaypichu kasaq.
They were all here.	Llapallankum kaypi karqaku.
Yes many times.	Arí achka kutita.
And, the other thing.	Hinaspa, huk kaq.
That’s where he would be.	Chayqa maypichus payqa kanman karqan.
I don’t care about fame.	Manam imananpaschu riqsisqa kaymantaqa.
I didn’t want to be here.	Manam kaypi kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I couldn’t do that.	Manam chaynataqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
So far he has done well.	Kunankamaqa allintan ruwarqan.
I have seen him before.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi paytaqa rikurqani.
Of course, that’s great.	Chiqamanta, chayqa ancha allinmi.
Now he began to think.	Kunanqa yuyaymanayta qallaykurqa.
If you don’t, you have nothing more to offer.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, manan ima aswanpas qanpaq kanchu.
Like a real day.	Chiqap punchaw hina.
I can't believe it, actually.	Mana creeyta atinichu, chiqaptaqa.
I didn’t see how that could happen.	Manam rikurqanichu imayna chayna kanman chayta.
Maybe something went wrong at home.	Ichapas wasipi imapas mana allin pasarqa.
She was as beautiful as she was.	Pay hina ancha sumaqmi karqa.
The man was lucky.	Chay runaqa suerteyoqmi kasqa.
And the best thing is to be immediate.	Hinaspa aswan allinqa chaylla kay.
I couldn’t find anything to do.	Manam ima ruwaytapas tariyta atirqanichu.
It’s going to be now.	Kunanmi kanqa.
Now, here’s one.	Kunanqa, kaypi huk.
Every day, in fact.	Sapa punchaw, chiqaptaqa.
But it will be a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allin ruwaymi kanqa.
That was easy.	Chayna kayqa facilmi karqa.
Every morning I can’t deal with it.	Sapa paqarinmi mana chayta atipayta atiymanchu.
He is such an inhuman being.	Payqa chayna mana runachu.
I am not happy about this.	Kaymantaqa manam kusisqachu kani.
Not sure if it means today or ever.	Mana segurochu kunan punchaw utaq haykapipas niyta munan.
I wanted to be there at night.	Tuta chaypi kaytam munarqani.
He is, he is	Payqa, payqa .
I’m pretty tired, to be honest.	Allin sayk’usqa hinan kashani, cheqaqta rimanaypaq.
Do the right thing every day.	Sapa punchaw allin kaqta ruway.
Here, there, there.	Kaypi, chaypi.
Even if there is a difference.	Huk chikan kaptinpas.
It probably did him a disservice.	Yaqapaschá paytaqa mana allintachu ruwarqan.
Things can always go wrong.	Sapa kutim imapas mana allinchu kanman.
He said he didn't think so.	Chaypim mana piensanichu nirqa.
I don’t want him to be alone anymore.	Manañam munanichu sapallan kananta.
I know you mean well.	Yachanim allinta niyta munasqaykita.
I didn't think about this.	Kaypiqa manam piensarqanichu.
If anyone was good, he was good.	Pipas allin kaptinqa, payqa allinmi karqa.
I’m afraid that’s wrong.	Manchakuni chay mana allin kasqanmanta.
There used to be ten.	Ñawpaqtaqa chunka karqan.
In fact, they all were.	Aswanpas llapallankum chayna karqaku.
I am beside myself.	Ñuqaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kachkani.
Maybe you really are a really important person.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni chiqap importante runa kanki.
In the morning, in fact.	Tutamanta, chiqaptaqa.
It doesn’t sound right.	Manam allintachu uyarikun.
What do you want.	Imatataq munanki.
It is no longer useful.	Manañam imapaqpas valenchu.
Something beautiful.	Imapas sumaq kaq.
I used to be happy.	Ñawpaqtaqa kusisqam karqani.
I don’t agree that you can’t do it.	Manam acuerdopichu kani mana ruwayta atiwaqchu nispa.
Beautiful, yes, but ugly.	Sumaq, arí, ichaqa millay.
It’s all good.	Tukuy allinmi.
Nothing wrong with that at all.	Mana imapas mana allinchu chaypiqa ni imapipas.
He was great, really great.	Payqa hatunmi karqa, chiqap hatunmi karqa.
Great beautiful looking mansion.	Hatun sumaq rikchayniyuq hatun wasi.
I have no idea where he went after that.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani mayman risqanmanta chaymantaqa.
I know it will be easy.	Yachanim facil kananta.
Not the least intelligent in the world.	Mana kay pachapi aswan pisi yuyayniyuqchu.
And he’s excited.	Hinaspa payqa kusisqa kashan.
I have always been surprised by this.	Kaymantaqa sapa kutim admirakurqani.
All of this happened very quickly for you.	Tukuy kaykunaqa ancha utqayllam qampaq pasarqa.
That’s really something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imapas.
Everyone was disappointed.	Llapallankum hukmanyasqa karqaku.
He, however, refused to listen.	Paymi ichaqa mana uyariyta munarqanchu.
This is a mistake.	Kayqa pantasqa kachkan.
That is,	Chayqa, .
Making it better.	Allin kananpaq ruwaspa.
How to make it known.	Imaynatataq riqsisqa kananpaq.
I really don't like it.	Chiqaptaqa manam gustanchu.
Two big black speakers.	Iskay hatun yana rimaq.
Learn all you can about it.	Chaymanta tukuy atisqaykita yachay.
And this was devastating.	Hinaspa kayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
That’s what he said.	Chaytaqa nirqam.
He would be just like her.	Payqa pay hinan kanman.
But worst of all, he says no.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinqa, payqa ninmi mana.
That means more mindfulness.	Chayqa aswan yuyayniyuq kayta niyta munan.
I probably should have.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay karqan.
I know what it is now.	Yachanim kunan ima kasqanmanta.
He is good enough to be bad.	Payqa allinmi mana allin kananpaq.
I’m always tired.	Sapa kutim sayk’usqa tarikuni.
You do it for me.	Qamqa ñuqapaq ruwanki.
But black he is not.	Ichaqa yana payqa manan.
I couldn’t sleep at all.	Manam ni imapipas puñuyta atirqanichu.
But this is a very big deal.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi.
That’s if you want it.	Chayqa munanki chayqa.
The bigger the better.	Aswan hatunmi aswan allinqa.
He's fine here.	Payqa kaypiqa allinmi kachkan.
It was a milestone.	Huk hatun ruwaymi karqan.
I can't figure out how to do that.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imaynata chayta ruwanaypaq.
Of course, this is still very uncertain.	Arí, kayqa kunankamapas ancha mana segurochu kachkan.
We can't, you know.	Manam atichwanchu, yachanki.
It would be ridiculous otherwise.	Mana chayna kaptinqa asikunapaq hinam kanman.
Someone else was more important than he was.	Huk runam paymanta aswan importante karqa.
This was a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi karqa.
They were anyone.	Paykunaqa pipas karqaku.
No, that won’t do.	Manan, chayqa manan ruwanqachu.
I want to be impressed by it.	Chaywanmi admirasqa kayta munani.
But he's never there.	Ichaqa manan hayk'aqpas chaypichu kashan.
He can't do it.	Ruwanmanchu.
We cannot eat without him at home.	Wasipi mana kaptinqa manam mikuyta atichwanchu.
We cannot allow this to happen.	Chayna kananta manam saqiyta atichwanchu.
Here, he said.	Kaypi, nispa.
He was not very happy.	Payqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqa.
Thanks again.	Hukmanta gracias.
If he can prevent it.	Sichus hark’ayta atinman chayqa.
He didn’t do it right away.	Payqa manan chayllachu ruwarqan.
Unfortunately, it worked.	Llakikuypaqmi, chay ruwasqanqa allinmi karqa.
Tell me something, please.	Imatapas willaway, ama hina kaspa.
It would be faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanman.
Now that’s the perfect time!.	Kunanqa chaymi allin tiempo!.
It would be really funny.	Cheqaqtapunin asikunapaq hina kanman.
He was going to be difficult.	Payqa sasam kanan karqa.
But he may not be alone.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapallanchu kanman.
He couldn’t get over this.	Payqa manan kaytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.
Sure that sounds like it.	Seguro chaymi uyarikun.
Everyone agrees.	Llapallankum acuerdopi kanku.
And that was, you know, knowledge.	Hinaspa chayqa karqan, yachanki, yachay.
Like anyone else, like a human being.	Pipas hina runa hina.
I suspect that’s where he is now.	Sospechani chaypi kunan kasqanmanta.
Hopefully he can help.	Munaymanmi yanapayta atinanmanta.
A terrible man.	Huk manchay runa.
Obviously, you don’t want that to happen.	Sut’inmi, manan munankichu chay hina kananta.
Please take steps to do the right thing.	Ama hina kaspa, allinta ruwanaykipaq imatapas ruway.
It will be hard, and fast.	Sasa kanqa, hinaspa utqaylla.

It was fresh and fast.	Chayqa musuq hinaspa utqayllam karqa.
He knew exactly what he was and who he was.	Payqa allintam yacharqa ima kasqanmanta hinaspa pi kasqanmanta.
I thought he would be happy.	Yuyarqanim kusisqa kananta.
I told him to do it.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi nirqani.
Everything was difficult.	Tukuy imapas sasam karqa.
He is in hiding at the moment.	Payqa kunan pacha pakasqa kachkan.
He knows where he’s supposed to be.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kananta.
I have too much to do tomorrow.	Paqarinmi llumpayta ruwanay kachkan.
I thought you could never make it.	Yuyarqanim mana haykapipas chayayta atisqaykita.
He probably won’t do anything.	Yaqapaschá mana imatapas ruwanqachu.
The process is an easy one.	Chay ruwayqa huk facil ruwaymi.
Like coffee this morning.	Kunan paqarin kukata hina.
That’s not easy though.	Chayqa manan facilchu ichaqa.
It was a beautiful new world.	Sumaq mosoq pacha karqan.
I still couldn't sleep.	Kunankamapas manam puñuyta atirqanichu.
Now, this is the important thing.	Kunanqa, kaymi ancha allinqa.
He seems depressed.	Payqa llakisqa hinam kachkan.
It was actually too bad.	Chiqaptaqa llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
There are really good people there.	Chaypiqa chiqaptam allin runakuna kachkan.
But everything is amazing.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas admirakuypaqmi.
He sounds like a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runa hinam uyarikun.
I feel like a fucking fool.	Ñuqaqa huk millay sonso hinam tarikuni.
Maybe this was true, maybe it wasn’t.	Ichapas kayqa chiqap karqa, ichapas mana karqachu.
It was the right thing to do at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa allin ruwaymi karqan.
I tried to do the same.	Ñoqapas chaynata ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
He said his name.	Paymi sutinta nisqa.
Therefore, it must be properly stated.	Chayraykum allinta nisqa kanan.
But he was injured.	Ichaqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
I didn’t think to ask.	Manam tapuyta yuyaykurqanichu.
He knew he could tell the truth.	Payqa yacharqanmi cheqaq kaqta willayta atisqanmanta.
It’s not a good idea to do that.	Mana chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu.
Second, a nicer house.	Iskay kaq, aswan sumaq wasi.
That was something before.	Chayqa imapas ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
Maybe this was the future.	Ichapas kay hamuq tiempo karqa.
She was so beautiful.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi kasqa.
Last time it really wasn’t even.	Qhipa kuti chiqamanta mana nitaq karqachu.
No one here, either.	Mana pipas kaypi, nitaq.
Could it be true? 	¿Cheqaqchu kanman?
Now, of course, they were.	Kunanqa, sut’inmi, paykunaqa karqanku.
It should have been somewhere a long time ago.	Unayñan maypipas kanan karqan.
He wanted to make sure she was okay.	Payqa allin kananpaqmi qawayta munarqa.
Maybe he wants to be you.	Ichapas payqa qam kayta munan.
This is baseball.	Kayqa béisbol nisqa.
I don’t really know how to handle that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yachani imayna hap’iyta.
Here is the real wisdom.	Kaypim kachkan chiqap yachay.
He has always been there for me.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqapaq karqa.
He could not tell them.	Chaykunataqa manam willayta atirqachu.
Now they are here.	Kunanqa kaypim kachkanku.
He knew that would be the case.	Payqa yacharqanmi chhayna kananta.
But I wasn’t in a position to talk to him.	Ichaqa manan paywan rimanaypaq hinachu karqani.
So, he was a nice guy as always.	Chaymi, payqa sapa kuti hina sumaq runa kasqa.
No, he couldn’t get over it all yet.	Manan, manaraqmi tukuy chaykunataqa atipayta atirqanchu.
It doesn’t really seem doable.	Manan cheqaqtachu ruway atiyman rikch’akun.
That would take a lot of time.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon kanman.
I mean later.	Qhepamanmi niyta munani.
So far, this has not been the case.	Kunankamaqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
I wish you were here with us.	Anchatam munayman kaypi ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita.
That’s what he’s hoping for.	Chaytan payqa suyashan.
That wasn’t enough.	Chayqa manan atirqanchu.
He says to her.	Payta nin.
Being a bad person.	Mana allin runa kay.
I hope it will be good.	Suyachkani allin kananta.
He lived alone.	Payqa sapallanmi yacharqa.
He couldn’t get away with it.	Manas chaymanta lluqsiyta atirqachu.
He knows everything that has happened.	Payqa yachanmi tukuy imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I won't be here for long.	Manam unaytachu kaypi kasaq.
That seems like a practical problem.	Chayqa huk ruwana sasachakuy hinam rikchakun.
He knew it was me.	Payqa yacharqanmi ñoqa kasqayta.
I want this job.	Kay llamkayta munani.
But he wouldn’t be alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kanman karqan.
Maybe he can do it now.	Ichapas kunanqa ruwayta atinman.
The speech is very broad.	Rimayqa ancha hatunmi.
I don’t know that it’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu chayna kananta.
That's why it's here anyway.	Chayqa chayraykum kaypi kachkan imayna kaptinpas.
It should be more popular somewhere.	Maypipas aswan riqsisqa kanan.
However, this approach is not recommended.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana allinchu.
He said he would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa nispa.
He was proud to be there.	Payqa orgulloso kasharqan chaypi kasqanmanta.
They were something there.	Paykunaqa imapas chaypi karqaku.
There is no one better than another.	Hukmanta aswan allin runaqa manam kanchu.
Someone or something had to do it for him.	Pipas utaq imapas paypaq ruwanan karqa.
He wasn't exactly my thing.	Payqa manam allintachu ñuqapa kaq.
It was very difficult to be with him.	Paywan kayqa ancha sasam karqa.
I wasn’t surprised, actually.	Manam admirakurqanichu, chiqaptaqa.
After being arrested.	Hap’isqa kasqanmanta.
He seemed very smart, very clever.	Ancha yachaysapa, ancha yachaysapa hinam karqa.
Whether that happens or not doesn't really matter.	Chayna kaptinpas mana kaptinpas manam ancha allinchu.
I was glad I was nobody.	Mana pipas kasqaymanta kusisqam karqani.
But now sooner is better.	Ichaqa kunanqa usqhayllan aswan allinqa.
This may or may not be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanman, manapaschá.
In fact, it did all last season.	Chiqamanta, tukuy qhipa pacha ruwarqa.
He is already	Payqa ñam .
He checked the situation several times that night.	Chay tutan askha kutita qhawarirqan imachus kashasqanmanta.
It was beautiful indeed.	Sumaqmi karqa chiqaptapuni.
Boy, if he ever was wrong.	Wayna, hayk’aqllapas pantasqa kanman karqan chayqa.
It was surprisingly difficult.	Admirakuypaqmi sasa karqa.
That wasn’t really a good thing.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu allin karqan.
Maybe he really wasn't that good.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptaqa mana chayna allinchu karqa.
He doesn’t eat much.	Payqa manam anchatachu mikun.
He couldn’t tell the truth.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu willayta atinman karqan.
It must be foolish, he must be.	Mana yuyayniyuq kanan tiyan, payqa kanan tiyan.
Couldn’t be happier without it.	Mana chaywanqa aswan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu.
They are easier now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi kanku.

Maybe one day, but not today .	Ichapas huk punchaw, ichaqa manam kunan punchawchu .
Really scared wrong.	Chiqamanta mancharisqa pantasqa.

He came quickly to deal with it.	Payqa usqhayllan chayman hamurqan chayta atipananpaq.
Yes, not at all.	Arí, manam imapipas.
I can't stand it if you do that.	Manam aguantayta atiymanchu chayta ruwaptikiqa.
But he didn’t refuse at all.	Ichaqa manan ni imapipas mana munarqanchu.
I went here last week.	Qayna semanan kayman rirqani.
But there is no such thing.	Ichaqa manan chhayna ruwayqa kanchu.
Do that again and again.	Chayta hukmanta ruway.
He’s recognized some that aren’t.	Payqa wakin mana chayna kaqta riqsisqa.
Confused as always.	Sapa kuti hina pantasqa.
He would be proud.	Payqa orgulloso kanman.
I want to think about this.	Kaypi yuyaymanayta munani.
I want you to be all mine tonight.	Kunan tuta tukuy ñuqapa kanaykita munani.
He wanted to be a part of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta huknin kaytam munarqa.
He took it better.	Payqa aswan allintan chayta hap’irqan.
It would be nice though.	Allinmi kanman ichaqa.
Not much better, but better.	Mana ancha allinchu, aswanpas aswan allinmi.
But, something.	Ichaqa, imapas.
But there is a more important reason.	Ichaqa kanmi huk aswan importante imaraykupas.
I didn't care what it was.	Manam imananpaschu karqa imakuna kasqanmantaqa.
And here he did it right.	Hinaspa kaypi payqa allinta ruwarqa.
But things don’t seem right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun imapas.
That’s why we’re so popular.	Chayraykum ancha riqsisqa kanchik.
He was a wonderful man,	Payqa sumaq runan karqan, .
It may not be true.	Manapaschá cheqaqchu.
Now he might not have been there at all.	Kunanqa manapaschá chaypichu kanman karqan ni imapipas.
He always had to be with me.	Payqa sapa kutim ñuqawan kanan karqa.
I have never been able to do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa atirqanichu.
No one has a house.	Manam pipas wasi kanchu.
And it’s almost black.	Hinaspa yaqa yana.
This is going to be a tough task.	Kayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi kanqa.
If anywhere was safe for him now.	Sichus maypipas kunan paypaq seguro karqan chayqa.
But he is not very good at it.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu chaypiqa.
He was just like her.	Payqa pay hinam karqa.
But it has to be you.	Ichaqa qanmi kanan.
They are not like me.	Paykunaqa manan ñoqa hinachu kanku.
In fact, things just didn’t happen.	Chiqaptaqa, imapas mana chayllachu karqa.
But for the most part, his actions were certain.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim ruwasqanqa seguro karqa.
Where is he now?	Maypitaq kunan kachkan.
It will probably be frequent.	Yaqapaschá sapa kutilla kanqa.
You are the one who does it.	Qanmi kanki chay ruwaq.
I don’t believe in that.	Manam chaypiqa creenichu.
This, it’s just like this.	Kay, kay hinallam.
The first one was huge.	Ñawpaq kaqmi hatun karqa.
But here is the problem.	Ichaqa kaypim sasachakuy kachkan.
Isn’t that beautiful.	Manachu chay sumaq.
Not so bad, really.	Mana chayna mana allinchu, chiqaptapuni.
I mean talking all night long.	Tukuy tuta tukuyta rimayta niyta munani.
These turned out really well.	Kaykunaqa chiqap allintam lluqsirqa.
If you have to do it, do it right.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq kaptinqa allinta ruway.
What’s going on here.	Imataq kaypi kachkan.
But the truth is just that.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi chaylla.
I listened carefully but could not hear.	Allintam uyarirqani ichaqa manam uyariyta atirqanichu.
Maybe it was too big.	Ichapas ancha hatun karqa.
I still feel that way, actually.	Kunankamapas chaynatam sientekuni, chiqaptaqa.
So that was kind of crazy.	Chaymi chayqa huk laya loco karqan.
It's never safe.	Manam haykapipas segurochu.
It’s actually really nice.	Chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi.
I don’t know, you don’t know.	Manam yachanichu, manam yachankichu.
I don’t know if he can do that.	Manam yachanichu chayta ruwayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
Someone always did.	Pipas sapa kutim chayta ruwaq.
I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.	Manchakuni hukmanyasqa kanaykita.
And then the night.	Hinaspa chaymanta tuta.
It was always so foolish.	Sapa kutim chayna mana yuyayniyuq karqa.
He should be very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kanan.
Yes, that is very bad.	Arí, chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
Yes, it probably was.	Arí, yaqapaschá karqan.
He almost seemed scared.	Yaqapaschá mancharisqa hina kasqa.
I know there, there is something.	Chaypi yachani, imapas kanmi.
But it is faster.	Ichaqa aswan utqayllam.
They are such wonderful people.	Paykunaqa chayna sumaq runakunam kanku.
Many people who do not speak.	Mana rimaq achka runakuna.
It really shouldn't be a big deal.	Chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu kanan.
I question everything.	Tukuy imatam tapukuni.
Surely it was the only thing he shouldn’t have done.	Cheqaqtapunin chaylla mana ruwanan karqan.
Something had to happen, had to happen.	Imapas kanan karqan, kanan karqan.
You don’t know who you are.	Manam yachankichu pi kasqaykita.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with that.	Arí, manam imapas mana allinchu chaypiqa.
The man will do nothing now.	Chay runaqa kunanqa manam imatapas ruwanqachu.
But it came quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan hamurqan.
But you are not like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanki.
It is difficult to say why.	Sasam imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta rimayqa.
Yes, he knew what was going to happen.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi imachus pasananta.
He would make it beautiful the first time.	Payqa ñawpaq kutita sumaq kananpaqmi ruwanman.
But he has to do it.	Ichaqa paymi ruwanan.
I'm really tired.	Chiqamanta sayk'usqa kachkani.
A lot of people disagree with me on this.	Achka runakunam kaymantaqa mana ñuqawan acuerdopichu kanku.
I’m still pretty tired.	Hinallam allinta sayk’usqa kachkani.
But he didn’t get an immediate response.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu kutichiyta chaskirqan.
That’s it, man.	Chayqa, runa.
You can’t go on like that.	Manan chay hinaqa puriyta atiwaqchu.
I can be a good villain.	Allin millay runa kayta atiyman.
This is what we did.	Kaytam ruwarqayku.
But what if you do.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman chayta ruwaptikiqa.
He was obvious.	Payqa sut’inmi karqan.
He knew a good deal about me.	Payqa allintan yacharqan ñoqamanta.
Very black, very black.	Ancha yana, ancha yana.
So yeah, you can't do that.	Chaymi arí, chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He doesn’t.	Payqa mana.
Doing this in a car is much harder.	Carropi chayta ruwayqa aswan sasa.
I wanted everything, two of everything.	Tukuy imatam munarqani, tukuy imamanta iskay.
Be a celebrity!!.	Huk riqsisqa runa kay!!.
That was the challenge.	Chay ruwaymi sasachakuy karqan.
He’s not doing very well.	Payqa manan ancha allintachu ruwashan.
But now he wanted to.	Ichaqa kunanmi munarqa.
He didn’t think it was true.	Payqa manan cheqaq kananpaqchu yuyaykurqan.
He will usually do it three times.	Yaqa llapanpim kimsa kutita ruwanqa.
But, you are amazing.	Ichaqa, admirakuypaqmi kanki.
I didn’t see it anymore.	Manañam rikurqanichu.
He can't go there.	Payqa manam chaymanqa riyta atinchu.
You were indeed in the past.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq tiempopi karqanki.
But it looks very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Good weather.	Allin pacha.
He goes, he doesn’t.	Payqa rin, manam.
I’m always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna kani.
I was just busy.	Chayllaraqmi ocupasqa karqani.
I do, really.	Ñuqaqa ruwani, chiqaptapuni.
He’s the one you are.	Payqa qanmi kanki.
Not so good, not so bad.	Mana chayna allinchu, mana chayna mana allinchu.
He didn’t want to stay here.	Payqa manan kaypi qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
It’s not a good thing.	Manan allintachu.
In fact, it was something like that.	Aswanpas chay hina kaqmi karqan.
I'm sure you're hungry.	Seguro kani yarqasqa kasqaykita.
So that worked out fine.	Chaymi chayqa allinta ruwarqa.
However, it has been incorrectly posted several times.	Ichaqa, pantasqa achka kutita churasqa kachkan.
You think he’d know better.	Aswan allinta yachananta yuyaykunki.
I was really alone and alone.	Chiqaptam sapallay hinaspa sapallay karqani.
It actually came out the first weekend.	Chiqamanta ñawpaq semana tukukuypi lluqsirqa.
If you really want to know immediately.	Sichus chiqaptapuni munanki chaylla yachayta.
I’ve never heard of this before.	Mana hayk’aqpas kayta uyarirqanichu.
I couldn't look at him anymore.	Manañam paytaqa qawayta atirqanichu.
I almost feel like a bad boy.	Yaqa millay wayna hinam tarikuni.
It’s as bad as the day before.	Ñawpaq p’unchay hina mana allinmi.
But maybe he won’t.	Ichaqa ichapas mana ruwanqachu.
Here, everything is contained.	Kaypiqa, tukuy imapas hap’isqa kachkan.
Where are you now???.	Maypitaq kunan kachkanki???.
But it’s okay, it’s fine.	Ichaqa allinmi, allinmi kachkan.
You have a good sense of humor.	Qamqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
I can play the game.	Pukllayta atiyman.
So I’ll be a fool.	Chaymi mana yuyayniyuq kasaq.
But it clearly failed.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kashan mana allintachu ruwasqanqa.
Alone this time.	Kay kutipi sapallan.
It won't happen tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam kanqachu.
I will never be half as good as him.	Manam haykapipas pay hina kuskan allinchu kasaq.
It was just beautiful.	Chayllam sumaq karqa.
Maybe this means he’s worried.	Ichapas kayqa llakisqa kasqanmanta niyta munan.
One day is like the next.	Huk punchawqa qatiqnin punchaw hinam.
But he certainly was, at the time.	Ichaqa payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan, chay tiempopiqa.
For the most part, it was good.	Yaqa llapanpim allin karqa.
That’s how we are.	Chay hinam kanchik.
But it’s not there yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chaypichu kashan.
There was disagreement.	Chaypin mana acuerdopichu karqanku.
But he realized why.	Ichaqa repararqanmi imarayku chayta.
It was wonderful to be there.	Chaypi kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Maybe they’re hungry, or they’re tired.	Ichapas yarqasqa kachkanku, utaq sayk’usqa kachkanku.
Tired of being alone.	Sapallan kaymanta sayk’usqa.
He would soon, maybe, but not yet.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan ruwanman, ichapas, ichaqa manaraqmi.
I’m a good guy.	Ñuqam kani allin runa.
Yesterday was a good day.	Qayna punchawqa allinmi karqa.
He couldn’t really walk anywhere.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu maypipas puriyta atinman karqan.
He couldn’t afford it.	Payqa manan qolqeta atirqanchu.
And then there he was.	Hinaspa chaymanta chaypi karqa.
I didn’t have much to do.	Manam achka ruwanay karqachu.
It doesn’t do anyone any favors.	Manam pimanpas allintachu ruwan.
I have never heard him say that before.	Kunankamaqa manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu chayta nisqanta.
It has been very cold all day.	Tukuy punchawmi ancha chiri kachkan.
Maybe faster.	Ichapas aswan utqaylla.
Which was kind of funny.	Imataq huk laya asikunapaq karqa.
He couldn’t find it anywhere.	Manam maypipas tariyta atirqachu.
I mean, it’s not .	Niyta munani, manam .
These differences are significant.	Kay chikan kaykunaqa ancha hatunmi.
I feel that way about everything.	Chaynatam sientekuni tukuy imamanta.
I’ll be with you shortly.	Pisi tiempollamantan qanwan kasaq.
It was all good!.	¡Tukuy allinmi karqa!.
He had no idea what was coming next.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imakuna qhepaman kananta.
He couldn’t do this alone.	Payqa manan sapallan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Now that’s not so good.	Kunanqa chay mana ancha allinchu.
And you’re the next one.	Hinaspa qamqa qatiqnin kanki.
In fact, it happened recently.	Aswanpas chayllaraqmi chayna karqa.
You don't know how many there are.	Qamqa manam yachankichu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munanichu.
That’s the weather.	Chayqa pacha.
Now that was what mattered.	Kunanqa chaymi imapas karqa.
He sure was scared.	Seguro mancharisqa kasqa.
All of that will happen soon.	Chay tukuy imapas pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
You were always the best.	Qamqa sapa kutim allin kaq karqanki.
But in agreement.	Ichaqa acuerdopi.
The night is very beautiful.	Tutaqa ancha sumaqmi.
He’s pretty good about it.	Payqa allin allinmi chaymanta.
But unlike before, he didn’t think he would do it right away.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu karqan, manan chayllachu ruwananta yuyaykurqan.
Rich people, both of them.	Qhapaq runakuna, iskayninku.
That would be a smart move.	Chayqa yachaysapa ruwaymi kanman.
I mean like awesome.	Niyta munani manchay hina.
That meant it was.	Chayqa chayna kasqanmantam niyta munarqa.
Everyone knows that now.	Chaytaqa kunanqa llapallankum yachanku.
So it’s more difficult.	Chaymi aswan sasa.
But they are all innocent.	Ichaqa llapallankum mana huchayoq kanku.
He would rather not know.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman mana yachayta.
No, not like the night before.	Manan, manan ñawpaq tuta hinachu.
He wasn't sure what he wanted.	Manam segurochu karqa ima munasqanmanta.
Still, it was not an easy task.	Chayna kaptinpas manam facil ruwaychu karqa.
How well the patient feels.	Unqusqa imayna allin sientekusqanmanta.
Like a house.	Wasi hina.
Which would be good for me.	Imataq ñuqapaq allin kanman.
Another bad two weeks.	Huk mana allin iskay semana.
I mean, it’s just, no.	Niyta munani, chaylla, mana.
Making a good play.	Allin pukllayta ruwaspa.
And all of this is ridiculous anyway.	Hinaspa tukuy kaykunaqa asikunapaq hinam imayna kaptinpas.
I can’t think of anything.	Manam imatapas yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
Then he knows.	Chaymantam yachan.
He is now everything.	Paymi kunanqa tukuy imapas kachkan.
But I’ll have to act fast.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanay kanqa.
Really angry, actually.	Chiqamanta phiñasqa, chiqamanta.
Should be there next week.	Hamuq semana chaypi kanan.
I mean all of them.	Llapallankum niyta munani.
I know from the beginning.	Ñoqaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi yachani.
I'm not sure, what you mean.	Manam segurochu kani, imatam niyta munanki.
He says what he says.	Nisqanman hinam nin.
Almost one, he says.	Yaqa huk, nispas nin.
He meant it admirably.	Payqa admirakuypaqmi chayta niyta munarqa.
Sad that's really it.	Llakikuypaqmi chaymi chiqaptapuni.
I really want to.	Chiqaptam munani.
Such a course of action is not appropriate at such times.	Chhayna tiempopiqa manan allinchu chay hina ruwayqa.
Something wasn't quite right, but he couldn't figure it out.	Imapas manam allintachu karqa, ichaqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
We are busy, but everyone has to do it.	Ocupasqa kanchik, ichaqa llapa runam ruwananchik.
I’m not really worried at all.	Manam chiqaptachu llakikuni ni imapipas.
At least, he thinks so.	Aswanpas, payqa chaytan yuyaykun.
He started saying something.	Imatapas rimayta qallaykurqa.
I am trying to do what is right.	Allin kaqta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakuchkani.
There he was in the hospital.	Chaypim hospitalpi karqa.
You probably know about him.	Yaqapaschá paymanta yachanki.
There are scientists.	Yachaysapa runakunam kachkan.
I’m not going to do that.	Manam chayta ruwasaqchu.
But he is an angry man.	Ichaqa phiñasqa runam.
He can’t beat where he is.	Mana maypi kasqanta atipayta atinchu.
That's a ?' 	Chayqa huk ?'
I mean that as a good thing.	Allin kaqta hinam chaytaqa niyta munani.
He knew exactly what was going on.	Allintam yacharqa imakuna pasasqanmanta.
There seems to be no reason.	Mana imaraykupas kanman hinam.
Anyone have a new idea?.	¿Pipas musuq yuyayniyuqchu?.
It's actually not too good to be true.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha allinchu chiqap kananpaq.
It probably sounds like a good thing.	Yaqapaschá allin kaq hina uyarikun.
Now they are .	Kunanqa paykunaqa .
She looked tired and nervous.	Payqa sayk’usqa, mancharisqa ima qhawarisqa.
That’s the beautiful thing about being young.	Chayqa wayna kaymanta sumaqmi.
But he is afraid of some things.	Ichaqa wakin imakunatapas manchakunmi.
You think this is clever.	Kayqa yachaysapa kananpaqmi yuyanki.
This is the single most important thing about him.	Kaymi paymanta aswan importante kaq sapallan.
He was nobody.	Payqa manan pipas karqanchu.
But tell me something.	Ichaqa imatapas willaway.
He wanted something right.	Payqa imatapas allintam munarqa.
You know this very well.	Kaytaqa allintam yachanki.
He was meant to be there.	Payqa chaypi kananpaqmi karqa.
The world, anyway.	Kay pacha, imayna kaptinpas.
The most beautiful person in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan sumaq runa.
This is what it should do.	Kaymi ruwanan.
That would be better than this.	Chayqa kaymanta aswan allinmi kanman.
But we’re not there yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi chaypichu kayku.
It was really great, great indeed.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq karqa, ancha sumaq chiqamanta.
He would have to go backwards.	Payqa qhepamanmi rinan kanman karqan.
That sounds too good to be true.	Chayqa ancha allinmi uyarikun, chaymi mana cheqaqchu kanman.
He looked very unwell last evening.	Payqa qayna chisi ancha mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I was more serious.	Aswan serio karqani.
John thought for a moment.	Juanqa huk rato yuyaykurqan.
Maybe three months ago.	Ichapas kimsa killa ñawpaqta.
He is a great guy.	Payqa huk hatun runam.
As in the future.	Hamuq tiempopi hina.
He’s not as stupid as you are.	Payqa manan qan hinachu sonso.
Now, it doesn't matter.	Kunanqa, manam imananpaschu.
That’s the only truth.	Chaylla chiqap kaqmi.
It was clearly summer.	Sut’inmi karqan verano.
Know who you are.	Pi kasqaykita yachay.
I really wanted to do more, you know.	Anchatam astawan ruwayta munarqani, yachanki.
I kept telling him not to talk to her.	Hinallam nirqani ama paywan rimananpaq.
This is a few hours ago.	Kayqa iskay kimsa hora ñawpaqtaraqmi.
But someone else came first.	Ichaqa huk runan ñawpaqta hamurqan.
That he didn’t feel right.	Mana allinchu sientekusqanmanta.
And she’s so beautiful.	Hinaspa payqa ancha sumaqmi.
It’s not that hard, really.	Manam chayna sasachu, chiqaptaqa.
I went home a little sad.	Wasiyman huk chhikanta llakisqa rirqani.
But that’s not very often.	Ichaqa manan ancha sapa kutichu chayqa.
Two years, actually.	Iskay wata, chiqaptaqa.
He doesn’t want to help.	Payqa manan munanchu yanapayta.
You can't stop that.	Chaytaqa manam harkayta atiwaqchu.
For about two months.	Iskay killa hina.
Not sure, how to do this.	Mana segurochu, imaynatataq kayta ruwana.
Maybe this is really the biggest problem.	Ichapas kayqa chiqaptapuni aswan hatun sasachakuy.
If you don’t want something, say no.	Mana imatapas munaspaqa mana niy.
Tired, he’s not so sure about that now.	Sayk’usqa, kunanqa manan chaymantaqa anchatachu seguro kashan.
No, no, he wasn’t.	Manan, manan, payqa manan karqanchu.
He knew he was hungry.	Payqa yacharqanmi yarqaymanta kashasqanmanta.
That was the day.	Chayqa karqan chay p’unchaymi.
I was crazy about him.	Paymanta loco karqani.
He thinks you are insecure about it.	Payqa piensanmi chaypi mana segurochu kasqaykita.
I know where the school is.	Yachanim maypi yachay wasi kasqanmanta.
And he will go alone.	Hinaspa sapallan rinqa.
I’ve been happy for a long time.	Unayñan kusisqa kashani.
He’s nice to go.	Payqa sumaqmi rinanpaq.
Being happy all the time is not.	Tukuy tiempo kusisqa kayqa manan chay hinachu.
He didn’t want to be difficult.	Payqa manan sasa kayta munarqanchu.
He says he’ll be there tonight.	Payqa kunan tutan chaypi kananta nin.
It was just that, sad.	Chayllam karqa, llakisqa.
They want to be out there.	Paykunaqa chaymanta hawapi kayta munanku.
Depressed people.	Llakisqa runakuna.
He is pathetic.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi.
That’s great in the summer.	Chayqa ancha allinmi chiri tiempopi.
You are like a child again.	Yapamanta wawa hinam kanki.
Do everything he says.	Tukuy ima nisqanta ruway.
You’re going to do that.	Qamqa chaytam ruwanki.
We are a house.	Wasi kanchik.
Very much yes.	Anchata arí.
He looked at the money.	Qolqeta qhawarisqa.
It’s not that easy anymore.	Manañam chayna facilchu.
Both of them are sick.	Iskayninku unqusqa.
He provided the food.	Paymi mikhunata qorqan.
You’re still here.	Hinallam kaypi kanki.
You are actually doing a really good job here.	Chiqaptaqa kaypi chiqap allin llamkayta ruwachkanki.
It’s easier to be mean.	Aswan facilmi millay kayqa.
That’s right, that’s the best.	Chayqa, chaymi aswan allin.
But, you know, it’s great.	Ichaqa, yachanki, hatunmi.
Repeat the steps.	Chay ruwaykunata yapamanta ruway.
It is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hinaqa.
I know it's tough.	Yachanim sinchi kasqanmanta.
This is becoming more common every day.	Kayqa sapa punchawmi aswan riqsisqa kachkan.
He really wanted to ask.	Payqa anchatam tapuyta munarqa.
It’s a learning process.	Chayqa huk yachay ruwaymi.
We are available all day every day.	Tukuy punchawmi sapa punchaw kachkaniku.
But they seem to be a big secret.	Ichaqa hatun pakasqa hinan kanku.
You really want to do that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwayta munanki.
There really isn't much I can do.	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu ruwayta atiyman.
He’s clearly a frustrated performer.	Payqa sut’inmi hukmanyasqa ruwaq.
He’s very tired and depressed.	Ancha sayk’usqa, llakisqa ima kashan.
But when is it ever so simple.	Ichaqa hayk’aqmi hayk’aqllapas chay hina facil.
He would never be good again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman karqan.
He wouldn’t want to do anything.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas munanmanchu.
It sounds good, but it’s not good.	Allinmi uyarikun, ichaqa manan allinchu.
I have always been like that.	Ñoqaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna karqani.
We had a nice swim.	Sumaq nadayta ruwarqayku.
But go today.	Ichaqa kunan punchaw riy.
Or another time, if you like.	Utaq huk kutipi, munaspaqa allinmi.
That’s never good though.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu ichaqa.
That something was wrong, but he wasn't sure what.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmanta, ichaqa manam segurochu karqa imamanta.
But no, you can’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan atiwaqchu.
But the night is always .	Ichaqa tutaqa sapa kutim .
Nothing is good for you.	Manan imapas allinchu qanpaq.
Why don’t you know? 	¿Imanasqataq mana yachankichu?
No reason for that.	Mana imaraykupas chaymantaqa.
This is not a bad thing though.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu ichaqa.
Instead, do something else.	Aswanpas huk ruwaykunata ruway.
Yes, the worst part.	Arí, aswan mana allinqa.
So, this is the second one.	Chaymi, kay iskay kaq.
Stop doing anything for him.	Amaña paypaq imatapas ruwaychu.
Then again, you did that last night.	Chaymanta yapamanta, chayta ruwarqanki qayna tuta.
He couldn’t see anything.	Manas imatapas rikuyta atirqachu.
Repeat this process.	Kay ruwayta yapamanta ruway.
You can’t make it work.	Manan atiwaqchu chayta allinta ruwayta.
If he doesn't, you won't know.	Mana chayta ruwaptinqa manam yachankichu.
The greatest ever.	Aswan hatun hayk’aqpas.
They haven’t been together in a long time.	Unayñan manaña kuskachu kashanku.
That’s what he does all the time.	Chaynatam sapa kuti ruwan.
You are no longer an unhappy person.	Manañam mana kusisqa runachu kanki.
He was a fantastic player.	Payqa ancha sumaq pukllaqmi karqan.
You can never buy at a bad time.'	Manam haykapipas mana allin tiempopiqa rantiyta atiwaqchu’, nispa.
That’s not a very good thing.	Chaytaqa manam ancha allinchu.
Worse, it makes no sense.	Aswan mana allinqa, manan imapaqpas valenchu.
He did it here.	Payqa kaypim ruwarqa.
Tonight, he went to talk to her about this.	Kunan tutam, paywan kaymanta rimananpaq rirqa.
You know, yeah no.	Yachanki, arí mana.
Or a restaurant.	Utaq huk mikhuy wasi.
He wanted to be a better person.	Payqa aswan allin runa kaytan munarqan.
And that’s certainly wrong.	Hinaspa chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu.
Something was badly wrong.	Imapas mana allintachu pantasqa karqa.
Know exactly where everything is.	Maypi tukuy imapas kasqanmanta allinta yachay.
But in the city.	Ichaqa llaqtapi.
I still think you mean it.	Hinallam piensani chayta niyta munasqaykita.
It was a really nice day.	Chiqamanta sumaq p’unchaw karqa.
And there they are.	Hinaspa chaypi kachkanku.
But it won’t last long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu kanqa.
I will never be able to stand it.	Manam haykapipas aguantayta atisaqchu.
First it was very clear.	Ñawpaqtaqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
Things were better.	Imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
So he knew all about it.	Chaymi payqa tukuy chaymanta yacharqa.
It was like that all night.	Tukuy tuta chayna kasqa.
We can’t leave now.	Manam kunanqa ripuyta atichwanchu.
The culprit certainly went too far.	Cheqaqtapunin chay huchayoq runaqa nishuta ruwarqan.
He did nothing to keep us company.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwarqanchu ñoqaykuwan kuska kananpaq.
You know where.	Yachankim maypi.
Better for me.	Aswan allin ñuqapaq.
He still does it wrong.	Kunankamapas mana allintam ruwan.
That wasn’t good of me.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqan ñoqamanta.
That’s something I can’t say.	Chayqa mana niyta atiymanchu.
I’m easy with that.	Chaywanmi facil kani.
He’s a terrible young man.	Payqa manchay wayna.
This has always been true, and always will be.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chiqap karqa, sapa kutim kanqa.
If not, maybe tomorrow night.	Mana chayqa, ichapas paqarin tuta.
I didn’t want to end up like him.	Manam pay hinachu tukuyta munarqani.
There was nothing much else to say.	Manam imapas achka huk rimayqa karqachu.
But do the wrong thing about it.	Ichaqa mana allintachu chaymanta ruway.
He was huge at the time.	Payqa chay tiempopiqa hatunmi karqa.
But yeah, it was amazing.	Ichaqa arí, admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I really hope this helps.	Chiqamanta suyachkani kayqa yanapananta.
And he was crazy about her.	Hinaspa paymanta loco kasqa.
He was extremely exhausted.	Payqa sinchi sayk’usqañan kasharqan.
Otherwise, it doesn’t exist at all.	Mana chayqa, manan imapipas kanchu.
They’re all right.	Lliwmi kachkanku.
Who is the first? 	¿Pitaq ñawpaqta?
If you don’t want to be with me, let me know.	Mana ñuqawan kayta munankichu chayqa, willaway.
I’m not sure who it might be right now.	Manam segurochu kani pichus kanman kunanpacha.
That will be much easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi kanqa.
I just have no idea how to do this.	Ñuqa ichaqa mana yuyayniyuqchu kani imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
He left everything behind.	Tukuy imatam saqirqa.
Do you want to be the first?.	¿Munawaqchu ñawpaq kaq kayta?.
He thinks about it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi chaypi yuyaykun.
I am so happy for you.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani qampaq.
It’s better to be there.	Aswan allinmi chaypi kay.
It sounds so crazy.	Chay hina loco hina uyarikun.
If anyone did that.	Sichus pipas chayta ruwarqan chayqa.
He does it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwan.
I think you knew that, at some point.	Chayta yachasqaykita yuyani, huk kutipi.
That’s a good thing maybe.	Chayqa allinmi ichapas.
So everything is fine.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allin.
If anyone can help with this please let me know.	Sichus pipas kaypi yanapayta atinman chayqa willaway.
I think you want this.	Kayta munasqaykita yuyani.
I am very happy about this !.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta !.
It wasn’t good enough for me.	Manam allinchu karqa ñuqapaq.
You probably know that.	Yaqapaschá chayta yachanki.
Here’s a good one.	Kaypi huk allin kaq.
It’s not a great day.	Manam hatun punchawchu.
He’s the one you want.	Paymi munanki.
Please don’t do it.	Ama ama ruwaychu.
I have been alone for a long time.	Unayñam sapallay kachkani.
And then, after that, it would be summer.	Hinaspa chaymanta, chaymanta, verano kanman.
This is it, however.	Kaymi ichaqa.
Yes, that was wonderful.	Arí, chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Today could be that day.	Kunan punchawmi chay punchaw kanman.
I know nothing about it now.	Kunanqa manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu.
You don’t think about anything.	Manam imapipas piensankichu.
He wants you to do what is right.	Payqa munanmi allin kaqta ruwanaykita.
I know it’s going to be great!.	¡Yachanim ancha sumaq kananta!.
The right thing to do is the best thing.	Allin ruwaymi aswan allinqa.
But they are very nice people.	Ichaqa ancha sumaq runakunam kanku.
But that’s just not the case with me anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chayllachu ñoqawanqa.
The real world.	Chiqap pacha.
It makes him.	Payta ruwan.
He wants me to do it.	Payqa munanmi chayta ruwanayta.
Which is really true.	Imataq chiqap chiqap.
He didn’t know much.	Payqa manan anchatachu yacharqan.
In fact, he is the greatest.	Aswanpas payqa aswan hatunmi.
I think he was out of town.	Yuyaykuni llaqtamanta hawapi kasqanmanta.
He had a very negative attitude.	Payqa ancha mana allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
I’m not a happy person.	Manam kusisqa runachu kani.
But that’s not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa chaymi mana allinchu.
I thought it might be a while.	Yuyarqanim huk rato kanman nispa.
He looked much bigger now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan hatunmi rikchakurqa.
It would be amazing to do so.	Admirakuypaqmi kanman chayta ruwayqa.
It was a great experience, and everyone enjoyed it.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, chaypim llapallanku kusisqa karqaku.
You’ve never been like this before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu karqanki.
Before the world.	Manaraq kay pacha.
Therefore, he could not give up.	Chayraykum mana saqiyta atinmanchu karqa.
They were both beautiful.	Iskayninkum sumaq rikchayniyuq karqaku.
That’s not nearly enough.	Chayqa manan yaqa allinchu.
He doesn't know who he is.	Payqa manam yachanchu pi kasqanmantaqa.
We used to come here a lot.	Ñawpaqtaqa anchatam kayman hamuq kayku.
You were in the hospital for ten days.	Chunka punchawmi hospitalpi karqanki.
The truth about what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta chiqap kaqta.
He probably died of grief.	Payqa yaqapaschá llakisqa wañupurqan.
The man is a player.	Chay runaqa pukllaqmi.
He was a very good teacher.	Payqa ancha allin yachachiqmi karqan.
He will always fail.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwanqa.
Said he had no idea.	Nisqa mana ima yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
It’s like a lot of things.	Achka imakuna hinam.
That seems fine though.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun ichaqa.
I'm pretty serious about this.	Kaymantaqa allintam serio kachkani.
But she thought it was a bit overboard.	Ichaqa payqa yuyaykurqanmi huk chhikanta chayta nishuta ruwananpaq.
We probably made it just in time.	Yaqapaschá tiempollanpi chayta ruwarqayku.
Good but sad.	Allin ichaqa llakisqa.
It was all innocent.	Chayqa mana huchayoq lliwmi karqan.
I'm still not quite there yet.	Kunankamapas manaraqmi allintachu chaypi kachkani.
You think what you want.	Munasqaykita yuyaykunki.
To the great thing.	Hatun ruwayman.
And now what.	Hinaspa kunan ima.
He did it in a remarkable way.	Chaytaqa admirakuypaqmi ruwarqa.
No, very surely.	Manan, ancha seguro.
It was an individual.	Sapa runam karqa.
That will not be the case now.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
He was disappointed in something, a little tired.	Payqa imamantapas hukmanyasqa, pisi sayk’usqa.
I wish it was that easy.	Munaymanmi chayna facil kananpaq.
That, however, is the best.	Chaymi ichaqa aswan allinqa.
You agreed with me.	Qanmi ñoqawan acuerdopi karqanki.
I knew what it was about.	Yacharqanim imamanta.
It’s not me at all.	Manam ñuqachu kani ni imapipas.
It’s just too fast.	Chayllaraqmi ancha utqaylla.
Instead, he seemed frightened.	Aswanpas mancharisqa hinan karqan.
But it’s money.	Ichaqa qolqetan.
Once or twice.	Huk kuti iskay kuti.
But it’s better this way.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kay hinaqa.
Describe the word.	Chay simita willay.
I learned a lot during that time.	Chay tiempopiqa achkatam yacharqani.
He thought he was alone.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi sapallan kananpaq.
It’s hard to do that.	Sasam chayta ruwayqa.
But this is a process.	Ichaqa kayqa huk ruwaymi.
So it’s very cold.	Chaymi ancha chiri.
This is your guy.	Kayqa qampa runam.
Please let me know who knows how to do it.	Ama hina kaspa, pikuna ruwayta yachan chayta willaway.
But it’s not here, not yet.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu, manaraqmi.
This is the most important thing.	Kaymi ancha allinqa.
This process is quick.	Kay ruwayqa utqayllam.
I couldn’t believe he did.	Mana creeyta atirqanichu chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That’s the last step.	Chayqa qhipa ruwaymi.
Never multitask.	Ama hayk’aqpas askha ruwaykunata ruwaychu.
That will be surprisingly ineffective.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwanqa.
Of course, that wasn’t a good thing.	Arí, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s not like he is.	Manam pay hinachu.
I couldn’t tell him anything.	Manam imamantapas willayta atirqanichu.
And you learn to play.	Hinaspa pukllayta yachanki.
It should take a few days.	Iskay kimsa punchawmi ruwanan.
I will probably be in the future.	Yaqapaschá hamuq tiempopi kasaq.
I won't do it now.	Kunanqa manam ruwasaqchu.
They are regular people.	Paykunaqa sapa kuti runakunam kanku.
He couldn't believe it.	Payqa manan chaypiqa creeyta atirqanchu.
But you don’t really want to.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu munanki.
The task was overwhelming.	Chay ruwayqa sinchi hatunmi karqan.
More real than anything else.	Aswan chiqap imamantapas.
That’s really good for him.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi paypaq.
Repeat all the way through.	Tukuy ñanta yapamanta ruway.
You’ve always been alone.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi sapallayki karqanki.
But you were never an adult.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kuraq runachu karqanki.
That’s what we did last year.	Chaytan qayna wata ruwarqayku.
Both were disappointed people.	Iskayninkum hukmanyasqa runakuna karqaku.
But it probably is.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kanman.
You’re right with me.	Allinmi kachkanki ñuqawan.
But don’t do that again.	Ichaqa ama hukmanta chay hinata ruwaychu.
One last fact.	Huk qhipa kaq chiqap.
I don’t know where to go with it.	Manam yachanichu mayman chaywan riyta.
It is usually in something.	Yaqa llapanpim imapipas kan.
And here’s the future.	Hinaspa kaypi hamuq pacha.
And this, in fact, happened.	Hinaspa kayqa, chiqaptaqa, pasarqa.
She may not always like him.	Manapaschá sapa kutichu paytaqa gustan.
They are happy together.	Paykunaqa kuska kusisqam kachkanku.
Then forgive me.	Chaymanta pampachaykuway.
That’s how I know it.	Chaynatam yachani.
Don’t do anything about it.	Ama chaymantaqa imatapas ruwaychu.
You are something or something.	Imapas kanki utaq imapas kanki.
I have no idea how to be this new person.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kay musuq runa kanaypaq.
They always have been.	Paykunaqa sapa kutillanmi chayna karqaku.
Please, folks out there.	Ama hina kaspa, chaypi kaq runakuna.
But you are something great.	Ichaqa hatun imapas kanki.
Very, very seriously.	Ancha, ancha serio.
But no one is.	Ichaqa manan pipas.
It’s been like that for a long time.	Unayñan chhayna kashan.
You are my man.	Qamqa ñuqapa runam kanki.
I can say that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi niyta atiyman.
In any case, he was not alone.	Imayna kaptinpas, manam sapallanchu karqa.
He knew what was what.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus ima kasqanmanta.
He couldn't remember what it was.	Manam yuyariyta atirqachu ima kasqanmanta.
One of them was a big one.	Hukninmi hatun karqa.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Allin ruwaychu.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ichapas allinta chayna kanman.
And we’re very happy with it.	Hinaspa ancha kusisqa kayku chaywan.
I’m sure we did.	Seguro kani chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
I did a lot with it.	Chaywanmi anchata ruwarqani.
Twenty years ago.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqpi.
Almost no one cares.	Yaqa mana pipas imananpaschu.
But it’s not good or right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu nitaq allinchu.
They are pretty good.	Paykunaqa allin allinmi kanku.
Act a little silly.	Huk chikan mana yuyayniyuq hina ruway.
It was something new about him.	Paymanta musuq kaqmi karqa.
I’m going to have to be.	Ñuqa kanan kanqa.
We cannot leave them alone .	Chaykunataqa manam saqiyta atichwanchu .
Boy, there were a lot of people.	Wayna, achka runakuna kasqa.
Everyone is kind of curious.	Lliwmi huk laya yachayta munanku.
It was as bad as it could be.	Atisqanman hinam mana allin karqa.
I need more than one.	Hukmanta aswan achkatam necesitasaq.
It’s like being hungry.	Yarqasqa kay hinam.
He really gave it to me.	Payqa chiqaptam quwarqa.
This one wasn’t happy.	Kayqa manam kusisqachu kasqa.
I can't really comment on this here.	Kaypiqa manam chiqaptachu kaymanta rimayta atiyman.
It’s a great day.	Hatun punchawmi.
Beautiful new house.	Sumaq musuq wasi.
But we did it right.	Ichaqa allintam ruwarqayku.
Both at home.	Iskayninku wasipi.
There’s no reason he should.	Mana imaraykupas chayta ruwananchu.
Another time, another time.	Huk pacha, huk pacha.
It does this in two ways.	Chaytaqa iskay ruwaypi ruwan.
He has a different idea.	Payqa huk chikan yuyayniyuqmi.
I’m not going to pretend it’s going to be easy.	Manam facilchu kanqa hina ruwasaq.
I party there all the time.	Chaypin tukuy tiempo fiestata ruwani.
He looked rather frightened.	Aswan mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Until now, it never really mattered.	Kunankamaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu importante karqan.
I didn’t actually see it.	Manam chiqaptaqa rikurqanichu.
Halfway through the season.	Kuskan pachapi.
But now, she looks great.	Ichaqa kunan, payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I like to think of it that way.	Chaynatam yuyaymanayta munani.
I think it was the past.	Ñawpaq tiempo kasqanmantam piensani.
The process went really well.	Chay ruwayqa chiqap allintam rirqa.
And there it happened.	Hinaspa chaypi pasarqa.
Yes, it was indeed a wonderful time.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin sumaq tiempo karqan.
He was kind of annoyed.	Payqa huk laya phiñasqa kasqa.
Young, I felt stupid.	Wayna, sonso hinam tarikurqani.
I know all of that well.	Tukuy chaytaqa allintam yachani.
There is no such thing as a statement.	Chaypim mana chayna rimayqa.
That’s the hard part.	Chayqa sinchi kaqmi.
But this he could not.	Ichaqa kaytan mana atirqanchu.
I want to get there.	Chayman chayayta munani.
Now they seem foolish.	Kunanqa mana yuyayniyuq hinam kanku.
I feel much better about it.	Chaymantaqa aswan allintam sientekuni.
I had to keep doing it.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanay karqa.
I'm tired and sick.	Sayk'usqa, unqusqa ima kachkani.
I'm really a big guy.	Chiqaptam hatun runa kani.
We don’t agree.	Manam acuerdopichu kanchik.
But if you have to do it.	Ichaqa sichus ruwanayki kanqa chayqa.
You can’t have it.	Manan chaytaqa hap’iyta atiwaqchu.
This is nothing really good.	Kayqa manam imapas chiqap allinchu.
Now he could study properly.	Kunanqa allintan estudiayta atinman karqan.
They have been friends for a long time.	Paykunaqa unayñan amigontin kanku.
A guy grabbed him.	Huk wayna payta hap’irqan.
I’ll be there.	Ñuqaqa kanqa.
Obviously he was exhausted.	Sut’inmi payqa sayk’usqa kasharqan.
He’s a lot bigger now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan hatunmi.
They all want to be with me.	Llapallankum munanku ñoqawan kayta.
But no, that would be wonderful.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
You want to be serious.	Qamqa serio kayta munanki.
And then a month.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk killa.
You have to do things.	Imakunatapas ruwanayki.
He didn’t want to know, not really.	Payqa manan yachayta munarqanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
Maybe he's tired.	Ichapas sayk'usqa kachkan.
Last week there was a guy.	Qayna semanan huk wayna kasqa.
The same great man.	Kikin hatun runa.
I feel bad about this.	Kaymantaqa mana allintachu sientekuni.
If he disagrees, that’s fine.	Sichus mana acuerdopichu kashan chayqa, allinmi.
I want to do this for you.	Kayta qampaq ruwayta munani.
I didn’t notice that at all.	Chaytaqa manan imatapas repararqanichu.
They were good to me.	Paykunaqa allintam ñuqapaq karqaku.
And there you go.	Hinaspa chayman rinki.
He’s probably pissed about it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaymanta phiñasqa kashan.
He wanted it to be him.	Payqa munarqa pay kananta.
Unfortunately, the other person knows this.	Llakikuypaqmi huknin runaqa chayta yachan.
I wanted it with me.	Ñoqaqa ñoqawanmi munarqani.
He didn’t want to tell anyone.	Payqa manan pimanpas willayta munarqanchu.
I’m sorry about that, for you.	Chaymanta llakikuni, qampaq.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu.
He was never going to make a big deal out of it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas hatun ruwaytaqa ruwananchu karqan.
Not sure what happened maybe it was too big.	Mana segurochu imachus pasasqanmanta ichapas ancha hatun karqa.
He said he could probably wait.	Payqa yaqapaschá suyayta atisqanmanta nirqa.
That would be easier.	Chayqa aswan facilmi kanman.
Funny how this world.	Asikunapaq hina imayna kay pacha.
Maybe he should have gone here.	Ichapas kayman rinan karqa.
Yes, he doesn’t know.	Arí, payqa manan yachanchu.
But you did it right, the first time.	Ichaqa allintan ruwarqanki, ñawpaq kutita.
He was angry with her.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa paywan.
He was very, very hungry.	Payqa ancha, ancha yarqasqa kasqa.
I’m not happy, no one is happy.	Manam kusisqachu kani, manam pipas kusisqachu kani.
That’s a good way to succeed.	Chayqa allinmi allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Yeah, you’re ugly.	Arí, qam millay.
Several times a week.	Semanapi achka kutita.
That wouldn’t be fast enough.	Chayqa manan usqhayllachu kanman.
I’m all here.	Lliwmi kaypi kachkani.
They’re all exhausted.	Llapallankum sayk’usqa kachkanku.
Not much else.	Mana anchatachu hukmanta.
I want to be beautiful.	Sumaq kaytam munani.
He thought it was a good thing.	Payqa piensaranmi allin kasqanta.
Hopefully, that makes sense.	Munaymanmi, chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
And now, the secret.	Hinaspa kunan, chay pakasqa yachay.
Not the nicest person.	Mana aswan sumaq runachu.
He can't stand being out here any longer.	Payqa manan aguantayta atinmanchu kay hawapi aswan unayta.
He wanted her to do what was right.	Payqa anchatam munarqa allin kaqta ruwananta.
Not going to school.	Yachay wasiman mana riy.
New this month.	Musuq kay killa.
Seriously, he actually said it.	Serio, payqa chiqaptam chayta nirqa.
Everything needs to be set up now.	Kunanmi tukuy imapas churasqa kanan.
There is something interesting here.	Kaypiqa imapas sumaqmi kachkan.
I’m always hungry.	Sapa kutim yarqasqa kani.
That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	Chayqa allinmi, manam mana allinchu.
Now it’s a big surprise.	Kunanqa hatun admirakuypaqmi.
He really, really wanted her.	Payqa chiqaptam, chiqaptam payta munarqan.
Kind of difficult, but a good challenge.	Imayna sasa, ichaqa allin sasachakuy.
We did something crazy.	Loco hinam imatapas ruwarqayku.
Something was terribly wrong.	Imapas manchay mana allinchu karqa.
So today was the day.	Chaymi kunan punchawqa karqa.
He’s the one I don’t like.	Paymi mana gustawanchu.
What needs to be done needs to be done.	Imakuna ruwana tiyan chayta ruwana tiyan.
Not at all at all.	Ni imapipas ni imapipas.
He did that day, angrily.	Chay punchawmi ruwarqa, phiñasqa.
But he’s fine.	Ichaqa payqa allinmi.
But it must be done properly.	Ichaqa allintam ruwana.
I know it very well could be.	Yachanim ancha allinta chayna kanman.
Very human.	Ancha runa.
This is not true at all.	Kayqa manan imapipas cheqaqchu.
The first year is tougher.	Ñawpaq wata aswan sinchi.
Now it will never be right again.	Kunanqa manañan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
Everyone wants it! 	¡Lliwmi munanku!
You know all of that.	Tukuy chaykunataqa yachanki.
It must be true.	Cheqaqtapunin kanan.
I couldn’t be with him.	Manam paywan kayta atirqanichu.
There were about two or three dozen people there.	Chaypiqa iskay kimsa chunka runakuna hinam karqaku.
The people were very happy.	Runakunaqa ancha kusisqam karqaku.
I didn’t know he did this.	Manam yacharqanichu kayta ruwasqanmanta.
They were one of a kind.	Paykunaqa huk kaqmi karqaku.
I want some information on this.	Kaymanta wakin willayta munani.
I just thought you wanted to know.	Chaylla yuyaykurqani yachayta munasqaykita.
This again can be a very important fact.	Kayqa yapamanta ancha importante chiqap kanman.
One year younger.	Huk wata sullk’a.
It looks great here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I want to find that money now.	Chay qullqita kunan tariyta munani.
But it will take time.	Ichaqa tiempon kanqa.
But there is no single way of doing it.	Ichaqa manan kanchu sapallan ruwayqa.
That’s what he got.	Chaytan payqa chaskirqan.
But of course, it will fail.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin, mana allintachu ruwanqa.
There was this though.	Chaypin karqan kay ichaqa.
I couldn't deal with that.	Chaywanqa manam atipayta atirqanichu.
And that seemed great.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
That happened that night.	Chay tutam chayna pasarqa.
I would love to have you around.	Ñuqaqa anchatam munani qanwan kuska kasqaykita.
It wasn’t supposed to be good.	Mana allinchu kanan karqa.
We did that for a while.	Chaytaqa huk tiempon ruwarqayku.
He never wanted to know more about me.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ñoqamanta astawan yachayta munarqanchu.
Unfortunately, that doesn’t always seem to be the case.	Llakikuypaqmi, mana sapa kutichu chayna kanman hina.
There are some precedents.	Wakin ñawpaqmantaraqmi kan.
Will it be better? 	¿Aswan allinchu kanqa?
I don’t see it there.	Manam chaypiqa rikunichu.
And these people were crazy.	Hinaspa kay runakunaqa loco karqanku.
It’s a learning process though.	Chayqa yachay ruwaymi ichaqa.
It wasn’t that fast at all.	Manan ni imapipas chayllachu karqan.
He was actually good.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allinmi karqa.
But everything should be fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanan.
And it was the best year here.	Hinaspa kaypi aswan allin wata karqan.
I would love to stay there again.	Anchatan munani hukmanta chaypi qhepakuyta.
Someone told me.	Pipas niwarqa.
But of course that’s not true.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayqa mana cheqaqchu.
I want to say that all the time too.	Ñuqapas chaytaqa sapa kutim niyta munani.
It may not be a human being.	Manapaschá runachu kanman.
He was under intense scrutiny.	Payqa sinchitan qhawarisqa kasharqan.
If so, you’re the one.	Chayna kaptinqa, qam.
I am a human being.	Huk runam kani.
I thought it might be good for you.	Yuyarqanim qampaq allin kanman nispa.
He probably would never do that now.	Yaqapaschá kunanqa mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
That is why everything is in place.	Chayraykum tukuy imapas maypipas kachkan.
I don’t want coffee.	Manam kukata munanichu.
Things were wrong, worse.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa, aswan mana allinchu karqa.
No idea what happened to him.	Mana yuyayniyuq imachus paywan pasasqanmanta.
That's a stupid thing.	Chayqa huk sonso kaymi.
There’s a mistake in there and that’s all.	Chaypin huk pantasqa kashan chaymi llapan.
He’s better, thank you.	Payqa aswan allinmi, gracias.
This is the future of speed.	Kaymi hamuq pacha utqaylla.
Today was a bad night.	Kunan punchawmi mana allin tuta karqa.
Not disappointed in anything.	Mana imapipas hukmanyasqa.
That's exactly what we had to do.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwanayku karqa.
Maybe once or twice.	Ichapas huk kutita iskay kutita.
And he died yesterday.	Hinan qayna p'unchay wañupurqan.
I know it's serious.	Yachanim serio kasqanmanta.
But thanks for that.	Ichaqa chaymanta gracias.
All right, you’re cold.	Allinmi, chiri kanki.
I really don't know about this.	Chiqaptaqa manam kaymanta yachanichu.
Now be honest with me.	Kunanqa ñuqawan chiqap kay.
But more than that, he was worried about her.	Ichaqa chaymanta aswan llakisqa kasharqan paymanta.
Where are you from?.	Maymantataq kanki?.
He said he liked it.	Paymi gustan nispa.
I am happy, I am very happy.	Kusisqam kachkani, ancha kusisqam kachkani.
The process, however, takes longer.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa aswan unayta.
After that it’s up to me.	Chay qhepamanmi ñoqamanta kanqa.
They are like that yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi chayna kachkanku.
He sounds great as always.	Payqa sapa kuti hina hatunmi uyarikun.
No one can do anything about it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
You are the only good person in the world.	Qamllam kay pachapi allin runa kanki.
I actually like that.	Chiqaptaqa chayqa gustanmi.
Wherever he was, he was not alone.	Maypi kaptinpas manam sapallanchu karqa.
So he said he felt uncomfortable.	Chaymi mana allintachu sientekusqanmanta nirqa.
And if you don’t know that, you didn’t know anything.	Hinaspa chayta mana yachankichu chayqa, manan imatapas yacharqankichu.
It was seriously serious.	Serio serio karqan.
He still doesn't know who he is.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu pi kasqanmanta.
Being ambivalent.	Iskay yuyayniyuq kay.
Everything, everything.	Tukuy ima, tukuy imakuna.
The big thing was the man.	Hatun kaqmi runa kasqa.
Often but not very often.	Sapa kuti ichaqa mana ancha sapa kutichu.
What am I going to do about it.	Imatataq chaymanta ruwasaq.
You know, it's no big deal.	Yachanki, manam hatun ruwaychu.
I could have been there with him.	Chaypim paywan kuska kayta atiyman karqa.
The people there were crazy.	Chaypi runakunaqa loco karqanku.
No one knows exactly why.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Three great days.	Kimsa hatun punchaw.
I can’t do do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu ruwayta.
So it was up to me to make one.	Chaymi ñoqamanta karqan hukta ruwanaypaq.
I know you have a secret.	Yachanim huk pakasqa kasqaykita.
That he wasn’t afraid.	Mana mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
I wasn’t surprised by that.	Chaywanqa manam admirakurqanichu.
I’m sorry I did this.	Pampachaykuway kayna ruwasqaymanta.
If he went there.	Sichus chayman rirqan chayqa.
I can’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikuyta atinichu.
Not bad really.	Mana mana allinchu chiqaptaqa.
I seriously considered going.	Sinchitan yuyaykurqani rinaypaq.
I couldn't take it again.	Manam hukmanta hapiyta atirqanichu.
It would be very large.	Ancha hatunmi kanman.
However, I think it would be very interesting.	Ichaqa, ancha sumaqmi kanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
Not being there all night.	Mana tukuy tuta chaypi kaspa.
He was hungry after all.	Payqa yarqasqa kasharqan tukuy imamanta.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa chayta ruwarqan.
It’s as good as you are.	Qan hina allin.
You may not know why, but it doesn’t matter.	Manapaschá yachankichu imanasqa chaytaqa, ichaqa manam imananpaschu.
And again, probably not.	Hinaspa yapamanta, manapaschá.
He was there but not there.	Payqa chaypim karqa ichaqa manam chaypichu karqa.
Study at a university.	Huk hatun yachay wasipi yachay.
There has never ever been anything like it.	Chay hinaqa manan hayk’aqpas hayk’aqpas karqanchu.
Not sure how much.	Mana segurochu hayk’a kasqanmanta.
Someone with him.	Pipas paywan kuska.
You never know,.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu,.
Maybe it doesn’t, after all.	Ichapas mana chayta ruwanchu, tukuy imamanta.
He is always there, ready to talk.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi kachkan, rimananpaq listo.
For some reason, nothing worked.	Imaraykupas manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Yes, there was this.	Arí, chaypi kaymi karqa.
Maybe it was stupidity.	Ichapas sonso kay karqa.
You are not the same as you are now.	Manan kunan hinachu kanki.
But probably not much.	Ichaqa manapaschá anchatachu.
I, too, do not like them.	Ñuqapas, manam chaykunataqa gustanchu.
And you know, that’s bad.	Hinaspa yachanki, chayqa mana allinmi.
So, it’s very good.	Chaymi, ancha allinmi.
I thought about it all night.	Tukuy tutan chaypi yuyaykurqani.
We are very beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanchik.
Again, it would be too safe.	Yapamanta, llumpay seguro kanman.
But there is beauty.	Ichaqa kanmi sumaq kay.
He doesn’t want to know.	Payqa manam yachayta munanchu.
That’s insanely difficult.	Chayqa loco hina sasam.
I couldn’t sit there.	Manam chaypi tiyayta atirqanichu.
Okay, that’s not entirely true.	Allinmi, chayqa manan llapan cheqaqchu.
That you can overcome it.	Chayta atipayta atisqaykita.
You want to know what happened with it.	Chaywanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munanki.
You don’t know who he is.	Mana yachankichu pi kasqanmanta.
However, there is a problem.	Ichaqa, kanmi huk sasachakuy.
Another wicked thing.	Huk millay imapas.
Makes it difficult to catch.	Sasa hap’iyta ruwan.
There was nothing I could do about it.	Chaytaqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
He just had to do it.	Payqa chaylla ruwanan karqan.
I'm always there.	Sapa kutim kachkani.
Probably too hard.	Yaqapaschá ancha sinchi.
It’s amazing, but .	Admirakuypaqmi, ichaqa .
If he was alone.	Sichus sapallan karqan chayqa.
He can’t stay here alone.	Payqa manan sapallan kaypi qhepakuyta atinchu.
That one day it was a few hours.	Chay huk punchawmi iskay kimsa hora karqa.
He couldn’t do that anymore.	Manañan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
It was always there.	Sapa kutillanmi karqan.
I want to make it safer.	Aswan seguro ruwayta munani.
What is this about.	Imamantataq kayqa.
Everyone knows now.	Lliwmi kunanqa yachanku.
Here, that's not such a bad thing.	Kaypiqa, chayqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
He could be one of them.	Payqa hukninmi kanman.
Very new now.	Ancha musuq kunan.
That could have been worse.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
This last time around.	Kay qhipa kutipi.
But now there was almost no one.	Ichaqa kunanqa yaqa manañam pipas karqachu.
You don't know when it is.	Qamqa manam yachankichu haykapi kasqanmantaqa.
Now, he wasn't sure.	Kunanqa, manas segurochu kasqa.
But what about the snow?	Ichaqa, ¿imataq chaymanta?
That you are so great.	Chayna hatun kasqaykita.
He’s really something.	Payqa chiqap imapas.
Again, that’s all there is to it.	Yapamanta, chaylla kachkan.
He had a new idea.	Payqa musuq yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
That has some importance.	Chayqa kanmi wakin importante.
Or the third one.	Utaq kimsa kaq.
Really really you.	Chiqap chiqap qam.
But that was as things should ever go.	Ichaqa chaymi karqan imakuna hayk’aqpas rinan hina.
Hopefully, it will be good.	Munaymanmi, allin kananpaq.
Unless you know better.	Manachus aswan allinta yachanki chayqa.
However, they do have a .	Ichaqa, paykunaqa kanmi huk .
It’ll be more obvious.	Aswan sut’inmi kanqa.
Everything was wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinmi karqa.
I think you can understand.	Yuyaykuni entiendeyta atisqaykita.
No, he certainly was.	Manan, payqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
That doesn’t sound too bad.	Chayqa manan ancha mana allinchu uyarikun.
Someone who wasn’t sure of his place in the world.	Pipas mana segurochu karqan kay pachapi maypi kasqanmanta.
A bitter cold watched it for a while.	Sinchi chiri huk tiempon chayta qhawarirqan.
Of course, there has to be a way to do it.	Chiqamanta, imayna ruwanapaq kanan tiyan.
Very bad weather.	Ancha mana allin pacha.
Or a traveler.	Utaq huk puriq runa.
He wants to do it.	Payqa ruwayta munan.
I just couldn't figure it out.	Chayllam mana yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
All so happy.	Tukuy chayna kusisqa.
Tom thought it best to do the same.	Tompas yuyaykurqanmi aswan allinqa chay hinata ruwananta.
That he liked it.	Chayta gustasqanmanta.
I don't think it is.	Mana chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
But, he was pretty amazing.	Ichaqa, payqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It’s a surprising fact.	Admirakuypaqmi cheqaq kaq.
That's always a big deal.	Chayqa sapa kutim hatun ruway.
He said nothing about my guilt.	Payqa manan imatapas nirqanchu huchayoq kasqaymanta.
The final result was fantastic.	Qhepa kaq ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqan.
He didn't know why he said that again.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku hukmanta chayta nisqanta.
I thought you wanted to be with me.	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim ñuqawan kayta munasqaykita.
Everything should be fine.	Lliwmi allin kanan.
That’s a good thing, he says.	Chayqa allinmi nispas nin.
It took a day for that to happen.	Chaypaqqa huk punchawmi pasarqa.
Thank you, baby.	Gracias, wawa.
Two short years ago.	Iskay pisi wata ñawpaqta.
And there will be more.	Hinaspa aswan achka kanqa.
Almost .	Yaqa .
I really don't know what tomorrow will be like.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu paqarin imayna kananta.
Being depressed is a very painful experience.	Llakisqa kayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
He wasn't sure what it was.	Ima kasqanmantaqa manam segurochu karqa.
But it’s not like that.	Ichaqa manan hinachu.
I couldn't believe it, you know.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu, yachanki.
That made it better.	Chayqa aswan allinta ruwarqa.
Everything could have been so easy.	Tukuy imapas chayna facilmi kanman karqa.
Not too sure about me.	Mana ancha segurochu ñuqamanta.
Now this is no longer true.	Kunanqa manañan kayqa cheqaqchu.
Maybe there is, but then again, maybe not.	Ichapas kanman, ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, manapaschá.
You’re not there.	Manam chaypichu kachkanki.
They want to be sad, all the time.	Paykunaqa munanku llakisqa kayta, sapa kuti.
He knew these things.	Chaykunataqa yacharqanmi.
He is a mysterious man.	Payqa pakasqa runam.
Say it’s just that.	Chaylla kasqanmanta niy.
Of course, that would be overwhelming.	Arí, chayqa llumpay hatunmi kanman.
I can’t find anyone.	Mana pitapas tariyta atinichu.
He knew what he was going to do with her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paywan ima ruwananta.
Yes, that would be wonderful.	Arí, chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
The lonely adult.	Chay sapallan kuraq runa.
It wasn't that hard actually.	Manam chayna sasachu karqa chiqaptaqa.
Certainly it could have been worse.	Chiqamanta aswan mana allin kanman karqa.
I was always uncomfortable there.	Chaypiqa sapa kutim mana allinchu karqani.
There is always a reason.	Sapa kutim imaraykupas kan.
Do something regularly.	Imatapas sapa kuti ruway.
It’s good, but not three times better.	Allinmi, ichaqa manan kinsa kuti aswan allinchu.
You don’t know what they are.	Manan yachankichu imakuna kasqankuta.
So if you want to.	Chaymi sichus munanki chayqa.
I know it's crazy.	Yachanim loco kasqanmanta.
The second night he did the same.	Iskay kaq tutaqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
No, it’s like this .	Manan, kay hinata .
But people are human beings.	Ichaqa runakunaqa runan kanku.
He would do what he could.	Payqa atisqanman hinan ruwanman.
Nothing much else happened.	Mana imapas ancha huk imapas pasasqanmanta.
Especially for me.	Astawan ñuqapaq.
That’s all he was.	Chayllam payqa karqa.
And really, it's just not worth it.	Hinaspa chiqaptapuni, chaylla mana valenchu.
He is present every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi kachkan.
About the problem.	Sasachakuymanta.
Now it should continue.	Kunanqa hinallam kanan.
This is one such week.	Kayqa hukninmi chayna semana.
I know who was there.	Yachanim pikuna chaypi kasqankuta.
Now he does that.	Kunanqa chaytam ruwan.
That way it can be a bit of a bit.	Chay hinaqa huk chhikantan huk chhikanta kanman.
There was nothing else.	Manam huk imapas karqachu.
And anyway.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas.
Now I know all that.	Kunanqa tukuy chayta yachani.
I’ll do better tomorrow.	Paqarinmi aswan allinta ruwasaq.
He pleaded not guilty.	Payqa mana huchayoq kasqanmantan nirqan.
Good for you, man.	Allinmi qampaq, runa.
Everything should be perfect.	Tukuy imapas allintam kanan.
So maybe it’s nice.	Chaymi ichapas sumaq.
Making it all about you.	Tukuy imata qanmanta ruwaspa.
He is not a bad man.	Manam mana allin runachu.
You said it would be.	Chayna kanqa nispam nirqanki.
But that could have been easier.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa aswan facilmi kanman karqan.
Who we are and what we are.	Pitaq kanchik, imataq kanchik.
Very, very sad, and worried about her.	Ancha, ancha llakisqa, hinaspa llakisqa paymanta.
It may have happened before.	Yaqapaschá ñawpaqtaqa chayna pasarqa.
But this is lucky.	Ichaqa kayqa suerteyoqmi.
So proud of you!.	¡Ancha orgulloso qanmanta!.
I wanted more for you.	Aswan achkatam qampaq munarqani.
We can do nothing for him now.	Manam kunanqa imatapas paypaq ruwayta atichwanchu.
I used to teach it.	Chaytaqa yachachiq kani.
All in all, it’s a great achievement.	Tukuy imapipas, huk hatun ruwaymi.
More on that another day.	Astawan chaymanta huk punchaw.
Now you are doing well.	Kunanqa allintam ruwanki.
And that’s a very difficult thing to do.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha sasa ruwaymi.
Maybe he wouldn't want to see it.	Ichapas mana rikuyta munanmanchu karqa.
I didn’t see any action.	Manam ima ruwaytapas rikurqanichu.
Is there a.	¿Kanchu huk.
There was a man.	Huk runam kasqa.
It’s already here.	Ñam kaypi kachkan.
I want him here with me.	Payta kaypi ñuqawan kuska munani.
Needless to say, he did.	Manañam niyta munanichu, payqa chaytam ruwarqa.
That was a really, really bad handle.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap mana allin hapisqa runam karqa.
If you don’t like it no big deal.	Sichus mana munankichu mana hatun ruway.
Otherwise, you may not be able to speak.	Mana chayqa, ichapas manaña rimayta atiwaqchu.
He has now been in prison for three years.	Kunanqa kimsa watañam carcelpi kachkan.
He thought about it all the time.	Chaypin sapa kutilla yuyaykurqan.
But perhaps something is wrong.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá imapas mana allinchu kanman.
This is for the best.	Kayqa allin kananpaqmi.
But he said no one could solve the problem.	Ichaqa nirqam mana pipas chay sasachakuy allichayta atisqanmanta.
But who knows what the future holds?.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq yachan hamuq tiempopi imakuna kananta?.
And be proud of it.	Chaymanta orgulloso kay.
To be that young.	Chayna wayna kananpaq.
Then again, maybe he does.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas payqa ruwan.
I have had a great day so far.	Kunankamaqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqani.
You, last chance.	Qam, qhipa chansa.
Yes, that’s it.	Arí chaymi.
That's why he seemed so famous.	Chayraykum payqa ancha riqsisqa hina karqa.
But I doubt I can do this.	Ichaqa iskayrayani kayta ruwayta atisqaymanta.
So that’s how more people like him.	Chaymi chay hina aswan runakuna pay hina.
Yes, he was hurt.	Arí, payqa k’irisqa karqan.
Where do you want to live?	Maypi tiyayta munanki.
I know a lot	Anchatam yachani .
He looked towards the mansion.	Payqa hatun wasiman qhawarisqa.
She was really very handsome.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq karqa.
He said he doesn’t exist.	Payqa manan kanchu nisqa.
However, this is probably not true.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kayqa mana cheqaqchu.
It was in the future.	Chayqa karqan hamuq tiempopi.
No one is better than another.	Manan pipas hukmanta aswan allinqa kanchu.
Who knows everything.	Pichus tukuy imata yachan.
I don’t feel good at all.	Manam imapipas allintachu sientekuni.
It’s been a very long time.	Ancha unayñam pasarqa.
If anyone can do that, do it.	Pipas chayta ruwayta atinman chayqa, ruway.
It may not have been a bad thing.	Manapaschá millay ruwaychu karqan.
I think you know what they are.	Yuyaykuni imakuna kasqankuta yachasqaykita.
I don’t have a lot of time.	Manam achka tiempoy kanchu.
You look very, very pathetic.	Ancha ancha llakikuypaqmi rikchakunki.
All very unpleasant.	Tukuy ancha mana allin.
He looked very tired.	Payqa sinchi sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa.
Yes, something is seriously wrong.	Arí, imapas sinchitan mana allinchu.
I just hope you enjoy it.	Chaylla suyachkani kusisqa kanaykita.
He never wanted to tell.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas willayta munarqanchu.
It doesn’t get any easier than that.	Manan chaymanta aswan facilchu kanman.
It's a nice day.	Sumaq p'unchawmi.
Not today.'	Mana kunan punchawchu’, nispa.
I sure am glad he waited that turn though.	Seguro kusisqa kani chay kutita suyasqanmanta ichaqa.
So maybe he was on to something that night.	Chaymi ichapas chay tuta imapipas kachkarqa.
Didn't take long.	Mana unaytachu hap'irqan.
In that ugly house.	Chay millay wasipi.
I’ve been there a lot.	Chaypiqa achkatam karqani.
Actually never, ever.	Chiqaptaqa mana haykapipas, haykapipas.
He never thinks straight.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yuyaykun.
Everything worked out great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allintam lluqsirqa.
The rumor got out recently.	Chay rimayqa chayllaraqmi lluqsirqa.
I know they are.	Yachanim chayna kasqankuta.
Yes, many people are in prison.	Arí, achka runakunam carcelpi kachkan.
But here he is alone.	Ichaqa kaypiqa sapallanmi.
Tom was sure of that.	Tomqa chaymantaqa segurom karqa.
I wanted it all.	Tukuy chaytam munarqani.
I don’t know where he lives though.	Mana yachanichu maypi tiyasqanmanta ichaqa.
You are an innocent man.	Mana huchayoq runam kanki.
Again, this big, beautiful house.	Yapamanta, kay hatun, sumaq wasi.
The real me.	Chiqap ñuqa.
It sounds about right.	Yaqa allintam uyarikun.
Then a little more nothing.	Chaymanta huk chikan aswan mana imapas.
He’s feeling uncomfortable now.	Payqa kunanqa mana allintachu tarikun.
Not so good for him.	Mana chayna allinchu paypaq.
He is always difficult for me.	Payqa sapa kutim sasa ñuqapaq.
Anyway, that's neither here nor there.	Imayna kaptinpas, chayqa manam kaypichu nitaq chaypichu.
But it just has to be.	Ichaqa chayllam kanan.
Not cold, not cold, not .	Mana chiri, mana chiri, mana .
Whatever the case, he did the right thing.	Imapas kaptinqa allintam imatapas ruwarqa.
But he is a real person.	Ichaqa cheqaq runan.
He never seemed worried.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas llakisqa hinachu karqan.
Every day is a good day.	Sapa punchaw allin punchaw.
I don’t really get it anyway.	Manam chiqaptachu imayna kaptinpas hapini.
But now it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa kunanqa sumaqmi.
He still sounds a little insecure.	Payqa kunankamapas huk chhikantan mana segurochu uyarikun.
It was supposed to be last week.	Qayna semanan kanan karqan.
Less than he is.	Paymanta aswan pisi.
He can really, really sing.	Payqa chiqap, chiqaptam takiyta atin.
Ready for anything, that one is.	Imapaqpas listo, chay hukninmi.
He wanted to be himself.	Payqa kikin kaytan munarqan.
I don’t want to hear a crap out here.	Manam kay hawapi huk millay rimayta uyariyta munanichu.
Things that are not in the city.	Mana llaqtapi kaq imakuna.
No one could tell what he would do next.	Manan pipas willayta atirqanchu qhepaman ima ruwananta.
Then, he did it again.	Chaymanta, yapamanta ruwarqa.
There is a double evil here.	Kaypiqa iskay kuti millay ruwaymi kachkan.
Instead, it probably will.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá kanqa.
He is really worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kashan.
It was a school thing.	Chayqa karqa escuelapi kaqmi.
But there is nothing yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi imapas kanchu.
We talked about it all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chaymanta rimaq kayku.
It’s the same person.	Chay kikin runam.
Another girl this time.	Huk sipasmi kay kutipi.
Drunk was what it was.	Machasqa kasqa imachus kasqa.
Very, very nice people.	Ancha, ancha sumaq runakuna.
I’m sure there are some.	Seguro kani wakin kasqanmanta.
I can't think about this tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manañam kaypi yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
You’re going to look like it.	Qamqa rikchakunki.
People seem very proud of me.	Runakunaqa ancha orgulloso hinam ñuqamanta.
Everything is too much.	Tukuy ima llumpay.
No one is saying much, really.	Manam pipas anchatachu rimachkan, chiqaptaqa.
I really want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta anchata munani.
He was a little annoyed.	Payqa huk chikan phiñasqa kasqa.
That could very well be true.	Chayqa ancha allintam chiqap kanman.
I can do that thing.	Chay ruwayta ruwayta atiyman.
So he knew, after all.	Chaymi payqa yacharqa, tukuy imamanta.
That’s what John knows.	Chaytaqa Juanqa yachanmi.
I am acting foolishly.	Mana yuyayniyuq hinam ruwachkani.
I was happy this evening.	Kunan chisi kusisqa karqani.
He felt comfortable somewhere here.	Payqa kaypiqa maypipas allintam tarikurqa.
We may have done that, but not quite.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá ruwarqayku, ichaqa manan allintachu.
They seemed happier, if he was tired.	Aswan kusisqa hinam karqaku, sayk’usqa kaptinqa.
That’s what he would do in school.	Chaytan escuelapi ruwanman karqan.
It will be easy.	Facilmi kanqa.
I don’t think about that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa piensanichu.
And that was some time ago.	Hinaspa chayqa huk tiempo ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
I didn’t want to do that now.	Manam kunanqa chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu.
A good man, but he couldn't swim.	Allin runa, ichaqa manam nadayta atirqachu.
This didn't seem right.	Kayqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
No one knows if it ever existed.	Manam pipas yachanchu haykapipas kasqanmantaqa.
He now knew how to do it.	Payqa kunanqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwayta.
That’s a good thing, but it’s not a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, ichaqa manan allinchu.
Last week night.	Qayna semana tuta.
You don’t want to hear it.	Mana uyariyta munankichu.
He's very angry about it.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kachkan chaymanta.
That doesn’t really require anything, it’s very simple.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas necesitan, ancha facilmi.
You think about it for a while.	Chaypin huk rato yuyaykunki.
This has to be me.	Kayqa ñuqa kanan tiyan.
I don’t believe it.	Manam creenichu.
He got into it hard.	Payqa sinchitan chayman haykurqan.
You go home tomorrow.	Paqarinmi wasiykiman rinki.
No one seemed alarmed.	Manam pipas mancharisqa hinachu karqa.
There he wanted her.	Chaypim paytaqa munarqa.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu kayqa.
Now he had a mind.	Kunanqa yuyayniyuqmi kasqa.
We did that once before.	Chaytaqa huk kuti ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqayku.
They were all new to him.	Llapallankum paypaq musuq karqaku.
But no, he wants me to.	Ichaqa manan, payqa munanmi chayta ruwanayta.
It’s actually quite simple.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sasam.
I can’t be without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam kayta atiymanchu.
You have no idea what it’s like.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu kanki imayna kasqanmanta.
Anyway he's perfectly happy about it.	Imayna kaptinpas payqa allintam kusisqa kachkan chaymanta.
It happened kind of fast.	Chayqa pasarqa huk laya utqaylla.
If someone else does, that’s fine.	Huk runa chayta ruwan chayqa, allinmi.
More, if anything.	Aswan, sichus imapas.
I knew he was a good man.	Allin runa kasqanmantam yacharqani.
I think you’re wonderful.	Yuyaykuni ancha sumaq kasqaykita.
Really great.	Chiqap hatun.
But he hasn’t done anything yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi imatapas ruwanchu.
I never saw the possibilities.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu imakuna kanman chayta.
That would have been the first.	Chayqa kanman karqan ñawpaq kaq.
That omission is important.	Chay mana ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
Guilty again, guilty of everything.	Hukmanta huchayoq, tukuy imamanta huchayoq.
And do it once at the end.	Hinaspa huk kutilla ruway tukukuypi.
But now it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha sumaqmi.
I was where the action was.	Ñuqaqa karqani maypichus ruway kasqanpi.
He wanted to eat.	Mikhuyta munarqa.
Then there’s the second one.	Chaymantaqa iskay kaqmi.
It sounds easy, but it wasn’t.	Facilmi uyarikun, ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
So that was a little difficult.	Chaymi chayqa huk chhikanta sasa karqan.
They are happy people.	Paykunaqa kusisqa runakunam kanku.
That he’s really really good at something.	Chay payqa chiqap chiqap allin imapipas.
Again, this makes no sense.	Yapamanta, kayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
He is known for it.	Payqa chayraykum riqsisqa kachkan.
You’re going to do that now.	Kunanmi chayta ruwanki.
They are all angry.	Llapallankum phiñasqa kachkanku.
That thing just happened.	Chayllaraqmi chay imapas pasarqa.
I didn’t think much of anything.	Manam imapipas anchatachu piensarqani.
You’re all right.	Lliwmi kanki.
You know, it’s that kind of thing.	Yachanki, chayna kaqmi.
It was probably the truth.	Yaqapaschá cheqaq kaq karqan.
If it says they’re not here, they’re not here.	Sichus mana kaypichu kasqankuta nin chayqa, manan kaypichu kashanku.
There’s every reason for that.	Chaypaqqa tukuy imaraykun kan.
That it should be better.	Aswan allin kananta.
Even if that’s part of it.	Chayqa chaymanta huknin kaptinpas.
He doesn’t seem to know much about anything for sure.	Payqa manan anchatachu yachan hina imamantapas seguro.
I know why and how.	Yachanim imarayku hinaspa imaynata.
It usually does.	Yaqa llapanpim chaytaqa ruwan.
In fact, it never happened.	Aswanpas manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
That wasn’t good at all.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan ni imapipas.
That’s really the film I wanted to make.	Chayqa chiqaptam chay peliculata ruwayta munarqani.
He doesn't want to now.	Mana kunan munanchu.
This man is amazing.	Kay runaqa admirakuypaqmi.
It was too cold to do anything outside.	Ancha chiri karqa hawapi imatapas ruwanapaq.
He knows this is going to be a big deal.	Payqa yachanmi kayqa hatun ruway kananta.
It’s just, an awful lot of it.	Chaylla, huk millay achka chaymanta.
She can’t ignore him.	Payqa manan paytaqa mana uyariyta atinmanchu.
He could never understand it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa entiendeyta atirqanchu.
Everything can be beneficial.	Lliwmi allinpaq kanman.
Now it’s terrible.	Kunanqa manchay.
Something would have tried to stop him.	Imapas hark’ayta munanman karqan.
We’re very clear here.	Kaypiqa ancha sut’inmi kayku.
He didn’t want to have sex with her.	Mana paywan puñuyta munarqa.
He didn’t want to talk to me.	Payqa manan ñoqawan rimayta munarqanchu.
That was amazing, really.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa, chiqaptapuni.
One of the worst in baseball.	Huknin aswan mana allin béisbol nisqapi.
In fact, they had great ideas.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa hatun yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
He said he never really thought about it.	Paymi nirqa mana haykapipas chiqaptapuni chaypi piensasqanmanta.
You can’t answer it.	Manam kutichiyta atiwaqchu.
That’s just like a child.	Chayqa wawa hinallam.
Maybe it’s all good, after all.	Ichapas tukuy imapas allin kanman, tukuy imamanta.
This is good, but not the best.	Kayqa allinmi, ichaqa manan aswan allinchu.
In fact, this may not always be the case.	Chiqaptaqa manapaschá sapa kutichu chayna kanman.
Again, this is wrong.	Yapamanta, kayqa mana allinchu.
Everything else is good about it.	Tukuy imapas chaymantaqa allinmi.
I’d rather be.	Aswan allinmi kayman.
I'm glad that's the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam kusisqa kachkani.
Anyway, this thing.	Imayna kaptinpas, kay imapas.
I would have done that a long time ago.	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwayman karqan.
So, one day, there he was.	Chaymi, huk punchaw, chaypi kasqa.
Now, how about some coffee.	Kunanqa, imaynataq wakin kukata.
He would do anything for you.	Paymi qanpaq imatapas ruwanman karqan.
Everyone knows that, for sure.	Chaytaqa llapallankum yachanku, seguro.
Tell me how upset you are.	Willaway imayna llakisqa kasqaykita.
The first one was last year.	Ñawpaq kaqmi qayna wata karqa.
It probably should never succeed.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas allintachu ruwanan.
I never thought it was bad, you know.	Manam haykapipas yuyaykurqanichu mana allin kananpaq, yachanki.
But it’s difficult here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa sasam.
This is wrong, I mean.	Kayqa mana allinchu, niyta munani.
I can't wait for this.	Kaytaqa manam suyayta atiymanchu.
It's there it's there.	Chayqa kachkan chaypim kachkan.
I want everything to be taken care of.	Tukuy ima allinta qhawarisqa kananta munani.
It’s hard to do here, though.	Kaypiqa sasa ruwaymi ichaqa.
But this isn’t really working.	Ichaqa kayqa manan cheqaqtachu llank’ashan.
I mean, it could be worse.	Niyta munani, aswan mana allinmi kanman.
Half of one, anyway.	Hukmanta kuskan, imayna kaptinpas.
He would never want her for anything again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas imapaqpas munanmanchu karqan.
Otherwise it’s not.	Mana chayqa mana.
It will be very large.	Ancha hatunmi kanqa.
For a lot of good.	Achka allinpaq.
In fact, he tried to win once.	Chiqaptaqa huk kutitam atipayta munarqan.
He wasn’t like me at all.	Manam ñuqa hinachu karqa ni imapipas.
A great scientist.	Huk hatun yachaysapa.
Almost night and day, actually.	Yaqa tuta punchaw, chiqaptaqa.
I don’t believe that now.	Kunanqa manan chaypiqa creenichu.
It’s really, really early.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta temprano.
It is not suitable for construction.	Manam wasi ruwanapaq hinachu.
If you want to come, let me know.	Sichus hamuyta munanki chayqa, willaway.
That cold day.	Chay chiri punchaw.
I’ve long suspected why.	Unayñan sospechani imarayku kasqanmanta.
It’s totally absurd.	Tukuy imamanta mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Learn how to do so here.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq kaypi yachay.
It should make a great movie.	Hatun peliculata ruwanan tiyan.
I'm always looking for it.	Sapa kutim maskachkani.
But yes, he died too soon.	Ichaqa arí, payqa nishuta usqhayllan wañupurqan.
We can’t talk to anyone.	Manam piwanpas rimayta atichwanchu.
Yes, that was two months ago.	Arí, chayqa iskay killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
He means it, maybe, but he can’t.	Payqa niyta munan, ichapas, ichaqa manan atinchu.
But this statement is not correct.	Ichaqa kay rimayqa manam allinchu.
He says once a month.	Killapi huk kutita nin.
Late for school.	Yachay wasiman tarde.
That’s the big deal.	Chay hatun ruway.
It doesn’t matter.	Manan mana imananpaschu.
The bad was good.	Mana allinqa allinmi karqa.
I want to do what needs to be done.	Imachus ruwana kaqta ruwayta munani.
There was nothing after that.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas karqachu.
He tried to keep his composure, and he was being appreciated.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi mana imatapas ruwananpaq, chaymi allinpaq qhawarisqa kasharqan.
Readier than him.	Paymanta aswan listo.
Okay, so then he can do it.	Allinmi, chaymi chaymantaqa ruwayta atinman.
Learn to eat.	Mikhuyta yachay.
In each school.	Sapa yachay wasipi.
If this is what you want, fine.	Sichus kay munasqayki kanman chayqa, allinmi.
Said he couldn't believe it.	Nisqa mana creeyta atisqanmanta.
But seriously, he did really well.	Ichaqa serio, payqa chiqap allintam ruwarqa.
I went to his house last night.	Qayna tutam wasinman rirqani.
I can’t be unhappy.	Manam mana kusisqachu kayman.
We can no longer ignore it.	Manañam mana uyariyta atichwanchu.
He had no idea how long it took.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu hayk’a tiempo chay ruwasqanmanta.
That's the reality here.	Chayqa kaypi chiqap kaqmi.
I just said it.	Chayraqmi nirqani.
I know it probably sounds crazy.	Yachanim ichapas loco hina uyarikun.
There it was.	Chaypin kasqa.
I’ve never not seen anyone.	Mana hayk’aqpas mana pitapas rikurqanichu.
But that’s a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinmi.
He wanted to go outside.	Payqa hawaman lluqsiyta munarqa.
He probably smoked cigarettes.	Payqa yaqapaschá cigarrota pitaq.
I have a few ideas.	Iskay kimsa yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He ultimately failed.	Payqa qhepamanmi mana atirqanchu.
Yes, she is very beautiful.	Arí, payqa ancha sumaqmi.
He has no choice now.	Payqa manan kunanqa ima ruwaytapas atinchu.
He knew the feeling.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay sientekusqanmanta.
In fact, they’re great.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa hatunmi kanku.
However, this is not true.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa cheqaqchu.
You’re the only one.	Qamqa chaylla.
But he is not doing that.	Ichaqa manan chaytachu ruwashan.
I almost hear it.	Yaqapaschá uyarini.
So, that’s easy.	Chaymi, chayqa facilmi.
He knew why he was tired.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku sayk’usqa kashasqanmanta.
That’s a horrible thing to do.	Chayqa millay ruwaymi.
But nothing could stop him.	Ichaqa manan imapas hark’ayta atirqanchu.
I've always been a little bit like that.	Sapa kutim huk chikan chayna karqani.
First of all, I don't like it.	Ñawpaqtaqa, manam gustanchu.
It’s ridiculously difficult.	Asikunapaq hina sasam.
Sure, now.	Seguro, kunan.
He wants to be rich.	Payqa qhapaq kaytan munan.
He cannot go alone.	Payqa manam sapallan riyta atinchu.
I'm still not sure how that happened, to be honest.	Kunankamapas manam segurochu kani imayna chay pasasqanmanta, chiqap rimanaypaq.
You have certainly done it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqanki.
If so, then perform the action.	Sichus chayna kaptinqa, chaymanta ruwayta ruway.
He said that over and over again.	Chaynataqa sapa kutim nisqa.
I couldn’t fix him.	Manam paytaqa allichayta atirqanichu.
You know what.	Yachanki imata.
He felt as angry as he had two nights ago.	Payqa iskay tuta ñawpaqta hinam phiñasqa tarikurqa.
That has to be the real thing.	Chayqa chiqap ruwaymi kanan.
Maybe not that long.	Ichapas mana chay unaytachu.
But I don’t know how to do the next step.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imaynatachus qatiqnin ruwayta ruwayta.
So it wouldn’t be a good idea.	Chaymi mana allinchu kanman.
He was probably genuinely scared.	Payqa yaqapaschá cheqaqtapuni mancharisqa kasharqan.
There is no such thing.	Chay hinaqa manam kanchu.
Now he couldn't drive anywhere.	Kunanqa manañam maymanpas carrota manejayta atirqachu.
Much, I’m better.	Ancha, aswan allinmi kani.
He is always drunk.	Payqa sapa kutim machasqa kachkan.
Yes, it would be great.	Arí, ancha allinmi kanman.
He’s going to be better.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
He knows about it.	Payqa yachanmi chaymanta.
She’s a terrible girl.	Payqa manchay sipasmi.
What a doer.	Ima ruwaq.
He was a non-smoker.	Payqa mana cigarrota pitaq karqa.
And he wants to.	Hinaspa payqa munan.
Probably easier that way, actually.	Yaqapaschá aswan facil chay hina, chiqaptaqa.
Do it very well.	Ancha allinta ruway.
It can’t be me.	Mana ñuqa kayta atiymanchu.
Today, however, is special.	Kunan punchawmi ichaqa ancha allin.
But he couldn’t do it a second time.	Ichaqa manan iskay kaq kutipi ruwayta atirqanchu.
But it is .	Ichaqa chaymi .
There was something so immediate and real about it.	Chaypiqa imapas ancha chaylla hinaspa chiqap kaqmi karqa.
He soon finds out why.	Pisi tiempollamantan yachan imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta.
He was terrified now.	Payqa kunanqa mancharisqa kasqa.
He probably caught her there several times.	Payqa yaqapaschá askha kutipi chaypi hap’irqan.
I don’t know what will happen next.	Mana yachanichu chaymanta imakuna kananta.
He doesn’t want to know anymore.	Manañam yachayta munanchu.
You know what happened last night.	Qanmi yachanki qayna tuta imakuna pasasqanmanta.
It’s the only way he could win.	Chaylla imayna atipayta atinman karqan.
He knew all along.	Payqa tukuy tiempon yacharqan.
They would all be very uncomfortable.	Llapallankum llumpay mana allinchu kanman.
It was an old-fashioned practice.	Chayqa ñawpaq tiempopi ruwaymi karqan.
This is something else.	Kayqa huk imapas.
He will come with you.	Payqa qanwan kuskan hamunqa.
It's never been easier.	Manam haykapipas aswan facilchu.
That, at least, was a good thing.	Chayqa, aswanpas, allinmi karqa.
It’s not like me, being out alone at night.	Manam ñuqa hinachu, tuta sapallay hawapi kayqa.
Yes, that was a bad thing.	Arí, chayqa mana allinmi karqa.
But maybe not really.	Ichaqa ichapas mana chiqaptachu.
Prettier, but the same type.	Aswan sumaq, ichaqa kikin laya.
It won’t be the same again.	Manan yapamanta hinachu kanqa.
Looking good is important, but not always.	Allin rikchayniyuq kayqa ancha allinmi, ichaqa manam sapa kutichu.
Then again, no.	Chaymanta yapamanta, mana.
Is it him or me, he repeated.	Paymi icha ñuqachu, nispas yapamanta nirqa.
So it should be tomorrow.	Chaymi paqarin kanan.
But here it goes anyway.	Ichaqa kaypiqa imayna kaptinpas rin.
He was as guilty of it as anyone.	Payqa pi runa hinam chaymantaqa huchayoq karqa.
That was a whole lot.	Chayqa huk lliwmi karqa.
But he refused to buy it.	Ichaqa manan rantiyta munarqanchu.
Most of the time it is not good.	Yaqa llapanpim mana allinchu.
Do this all the time.	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempo ruway.
So both could be true.	Chaymi iskayninku chiqap kanman.
But everything is bad.	Ichaqa mana allinmi tukuy imapas.
But they both know it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa iskayninkun yachanku mana facilchu kananta.
It was a beautiful late summer morning.	Chayqa karqan sumaq tarde verano paqarinmi.
You don’t want to, either.	Ama munankichu, nitaq.
But so far it's not bad.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manam mana allinchu.
The truth is the truth.	Chiqap kaqmi chiqap kaq.
He was very tired and very hungry.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa, ancha yarqasqa ima kasqa.
No, he wasn’t right.	Manan, payqa manan allinchu kasqa.
Maybe more different people.	Ichapas aswan huk hina runakuna.
But there we are.	Ichaqa chaypim kachkaniku.
I want it to be bigger.	Aswan hatun kananta munani.
But then he is ambivalent.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa iskay yuyayniyuqmi.
I'm not sure how good it is.	Manam segurochu kani imayna allin kasqanmanta.
Came here this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi kayman hamurqa.
We did that last year.	Chaytaqa qayna wata ruwarqayku.
He was always the man.	Sapa kutim chay runa karqa.
Nothing out there.	Mana imapas chay hawapi.
It was about who he was.	Chayqa karqa pi kasqanmantam.
Older than him, for sure.	Paymanta kuraq, seguro.
What you don’t know.	Mana yachasqaykita.
It will probably be here some time next week.	Yaqapaschá hamuq semanapi huk tiempo kaypi kanqa.
I thought it could be worse than this.	Kaymanta aswan mana allin kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
It wasn’t a good fit for that.	Chaypaqqa manan allinchu karqan.
But no one could help him.	Ichaqa manan pipas yanapayta atirqanchu.
Tell me the worst.	Aswan mana allin kaqta willaway.
Tell me now.	Kunan ñuqawan niy.
One of the best, but more than that.	Huknin aswan allin, ichaqa chaymanta aswan.
He thought it was for the best.	Payqa allinpaq kasqanmantan yuyaykurqan.
I did that all last week.	Chaytaqa qayna semanan tukuyta ruwarqani.
But it couldn’t be better.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu kanman.
Does anyone know?.	¿Pipas yachanchu?.
Then he said a book.	Hinan huk librota nirqan.
This, this, but not this.	Kay, kay, ichaqa mana kaychu.
Guilty and angry.	Huchayoq hinaspa phiñasqa.
The money you want later.	Qhepaman munasqayki qolqeta.
But now he knew he could get over it.	Ichaqa kunanmi yacharqan chayta atipananta.
No one was there that day.	Chay punchawqa manam pipas chaypichu karqa.
Yes, he told me that.	Arí, chaynatam niwarqa.
No, the other one.	Manan, huknin kaq.
In fact, every day.	Chiqaptaqa, sapa punchawmi.
But there’s not much to be done about it.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu chaymantaqa ruwana.
It seems just in time.	Tiempollanpi hinam rikchakun.
Things will go wrong after that.	Chay qhepaman imapas mana allintachu ruwanqa.
The whole day was good.	Tukuy punchawmi allin karqa.
It doesn’t make it any better or any worse.	Manam chaytaqa aswan allintachu nitaq aswan mana allintachu ruwan.
You’ve known that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan yachanki.
It does everything but that.	Tukuy imatam ruwan ichaqa chayta.
He was out most of the night.	Payqa yaqa llapan tutam hawapi karqa.
I’d love to hear from you.	Munaymanmi uyariyta qanmanta.
She is a very smart and beautiful girl.	Payqa ancha yachaysapa sumaq sipasmi.
Then one after the other.	Chaymanta hukmanta hukmanta.
It was an important time.	Importante tiempon karqan.
There goes a now.	Chaypin rin huk kunan.
It was just ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinallam karqa.
This can be extremely uncomfortable.	Kayqa sinchi mana allinchu kanman.
I learned the game.	Chay pukllayta yacharqani.
But someone knows that.	Ichaqa pipas chaytam yachan.
A strange study, that.	Huk mana riqsisqa yachay, chay.
He exceeded his expectations.	Payqa suyasqanmanta aswan hatunmi karqan.
I hope you are not worried about me.	Suyachkani mana ñuqamanta llakisqa kasqaykita.
I’m sure he’ll do great.	Seguro kani hatun ruwananta.
He should be fine, though.	Payqa allinmi kanan, ichaqa.
I just didn’t know.	Chayllaraqmi mana yacharqanichu.
You were a fool.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi karqanki.
That wasn’t like him.	Chayqa mana pay hinachu karqan.
That’s why it’s so great.	Chayraykum ancha hatun.
Now that would be nice!.	Kunanqa chayqa sumaqmi kanman!.
I know you are a wise man.	Yachanim yachaysapa runa kasqaykita.
But that is probably not true.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayqa mana cheqaqchu.
I saw him there.	Chaypim payta rikurqani.
There is a	Chaypin kashan .
But if you know.	Ichaqa yachanki chayqa.
He knew, yes.	Payqa yacharqanmi, arí.
They were like that.	Paykunaqa hinan karqanku.
So it has to be something else.	Chaymi huk imapas kanan.
But that may be later.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo kanman.
There he was safe.	Chaypin payqa seguro kasharqan.
That’s the only thing to do.	Chayllam ruwana.
I want to tell you about it.	Chaymantam willayta munani.
He told the weather.	Tiempotan willarqan.
We didn’t do very well.	Mana ancha allintachu ruwarqayku.
He couldn't bear to go.	Payqa manam aguantayta atirqachu riyta.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.	Paqarin paqarinmi puntata ruwasaq.
He told the truth.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin willarqan.
He said he would do well.	Paymi nirqa allinta ruwasaq nispa.
You can’t be that bad.	Manan chay hina millay kayta atiwaqchu.
We certainly did it here.	Chiqamanta kaypi ruwarqayku.
This would be such a big deal.	Kayqa chayna hatunmi kanman.
And then again the week after that.	Hinaspa chaymanta yapamanta chaymanta semana.
He was starving to death.	Payqa yarqaymanta kachkarqa.
I want to be a part of everything.	Tukuy imamanta huknin kaytam munani.
I've got that letter.	Chay cartata hap'ini.
Something was very, very wrong.	Imapas ancha, ancha mana allinchu karqa.
It was about three.	Yaqa kimsa hinam karqa.
He said everything was fine here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi nispam nirqa.
Eventually it should happen.	Qhepamanmi chayna kanan.
Not much about that here.	Mana anchatachu chaymanta kaypi.
But it will be a process.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi kanqa.
He couldn't be young again.	Payqa manañam hukmanta wayna kayta atirqachu.
In fact, it was really hard.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa karqan.
You can’t do anything to me.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu ñoqawanqa.
But for some reason it doesn’t work.	Ichaqa imaraykupas manan allinchu.
I couldn’t be this.	Manam kayta atirqanichu.
He is a desperate man.	Payqa hukmanyasqa runam.
He was no longer human.	Payqa manañan runa hinachu karqan.
Things were probably better here.	Kaypiqa yaqapaschá imapas aswan allin karqa.
I think people are sick of it.	Runakuna chaymanta unqusqa kasqankuta yuyani.
So, here it is!.	Chaymi, kaypi kachkan!.
He never tells the truth.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu nin.
The black man.	Chay yana runa.
He’s never been able to do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa atirqanchu.
People don’t really want it.	Runakunaqa manan cheqaqtachu munanku.
He was probably sad and angry.	Payqa yaqapaschá llakisqa, phiñasqa ima kasharqan.
I hope you know this anyway.	Suyachkani imayna kaptinpas kayta yachasqaykita.
And then it never happened again.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
But it was serious enough.	Ichaqa allintan serio karqan.
I am a lonely person.	Sapallan runam kani.
I never went anywhere.	Manam haykapipas maymanpas rirqanichu.
They all I knew better.	Llapallankum aswan allinta yacharqani.
Something came up.	Imapas hamurqa.
But it was too late for that.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa qhepamanmi tiempo karqan.
I know what you were doing at the time.	Yachanim chay tiempopi ima ruwasqaykita.
We had failed twice before.	Ñawpaqtaqa iskay kutitan mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
That was kind of a big deal.	Chayqa huk laya hatun ruwaymi karqa.
I thought of it immediately.	Chaytaqa chayllam piensarqani.
He is doing well now.	Payqa kunanqa allintam ruwachkan.
It doesn’t have to be a big deal.	Manan hatun ruwaychu kanan.
And he was here.	Hinaspa payqa kaypi kasqa.
He made a nice play there.	Chaypi sumaq pukllayta ruwarqa.
That’s what this is going to be.	Chayqa kaymi kanqa.
Not the best, but the toughest.	Mana aswan allinchu, aswanpas aswan sinchi kaqmi.
He looks like he's going to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwananpaq hinam rikchakun.
Man is still a man.	Runaqa runa hinallam kachkan.
They are now very large.	Kunanqa ancha hatunmi kanku.
Shouldn’t we be doing that.	Manachu chayta ruwananchik tiyan.
If so, it would be good to do so.	Sichus chay hina karqan chayqa ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
You’re thinking about it.	Yuyaykunki.
We are less intelligent.	Aswan pisi yuyayniyuqmi kanchik.
I must have seen something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikurqani.
There was something special about it.	Chaypiqa imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
But it wouldn’t have been so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanman karqan.
There can be so much going on.	Chayna achka ruwaymi kanman.
He never knew it would happen.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu chhayna kananta.
What is the best way to do it.	Imataq aswan allin ruway.
Always in trouble.	Sapa kuti sasachakuypi.
I had an idea last night.	Qayna tutam huk yuyayniyuq karqani.
This is probably the best way to do it.	Yaqapaschá chay ruwayqa aswan allinqa kanqa.
And what if he does.	Hinaspa, ¿imataq kanman chayta ruwaptinqa.
He said it was easy.	Payqa facilmi kasqanmanta nirqa.
Can't say how many times.	Mana niyta atinchu hayk'a kutita.
He had a great sense of humor.	Hatun sumaq yuyayniyuqmi karqan.
I can make one too if you want.	Ñuqapas hukta ruwayta atiyman sichus munanki chayqa.
This is what we need to do.	Kaytam ruwananchik.
It would really mean a lot.	Chiqamanta anchata niyta munanman.
The only easy day was yesterday.	Chaylla facil punchawqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
Both of these sound pretty awesome.	Kay iskayninku allin manchay uyarikun.
They are not like other depressed people.	Paykunaqa manan wakin llakisqa runakuna hinachu kanku.
Yes, every day.	Arí, sapa punchaw.
Nothing is easier.	Manan imapas aswan facilchu.
Yes, it doesn’t make sense.	Arí, mana yuyayniyuqchu.
I plan to play it soon.	Chayta usqhaylla tocayta yuyaykuni.
People weren’t good enough.	Runakuna mana allinchu karqan.
In fact he is.	Chiqaptaqa payqa.
But that would be too easy.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha facilmi kanman.
Every day almost.	Sapa punchaw yaqa.
He couldn't let that go.	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atirqachu.
That’s where you’ll be safer.	Chaypin aswan seguro kanki.
He’s not black like most.	Payqa manan yaqa llapan hinachu yana.
He couldn't let this go.	Payqa manam kayta saqiyta atirqachu.
But maybe he did it differently.	Ichaqa ichapas huk hina ruwarqa.
He wasn’t there anymore.	Manañam chaypichu karqa.
They know how to swim.	Paykunaqa nadayta yachanku.
And then, well, this happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta, allinmi, kayqa pasarqa.
So this is not humane.	Chaymi kayqa mana runa hinachu.
That doesn’t mean it doesn’t.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But they are not at all sure.	Ichaqa manan imapipas segurochu kanku.
He wasn’t like her.	Payqa manan pay hinachu karqan.
Obviously, it means .	Sut’inmi, niyta munan .
I still don't really care about that.	Kunankamapas manam chaymantaqa anchatachu llakikuni.
I wasn’t comfortable there.	Chaypiqa manam allinchu karqani.
And then another person, another person.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk runa, huk runa.
But no one ever does.	Ichaqa manan pipas hayk’aqpas ruwanchu.
I’m sorry about this.	Kaymantaqa llakikuni.
They are as flawed as everyone else.	Paykunaqa llapa runakuna hinam pantasqa kanku.
He didn’t really know anything about her.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu paymanta imatapas yacharqan.
He couldn’t, not really.	Payqa manan atirqanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
I really think it's good.	Chiqaptam piensani allin kasqanmanta.
He is very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqam kachkan.
Do you know?.	¿Yachankichu?.
I hadn’t realized that yet.	Chaytaqa manaraqmi repararqanichu.
Many may not.	Achka manapaschá.
He couldn’t work with her here.	Payqa manan kaypi paywan llank’ayta atirqanchu.
In fact, he can do much better than that.	Aswanpas chaymantaqa aswan allintan ruwayta atinman.
People want to come and go.	Runakunaqa hamuyta ripuyta munanku.
Now you’re doing it.	Kunanqa ruwachkanki.
And he just did it.	Hinaspa chaylla ruwarqa.
But it can be a little big.	Ichaqa huk chhikanta hatunmi kanman.
You’re like a child.	Wawa hinam kanki.
I will never, ever be that person.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas chay runachu kasaq.
Every day is all about him.	Sapa punchawmi paymanta tukuy imapas.
It’s the same day.	Kikin punchawmi.
But no one knows his real name.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu cheqaq sutinta.
He did well tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam allinta ruwarqa.
In fact, there's no reason it won't be here.	Chiqaptaqa, manam kanchu imaraykupas kaypiqa mana kanqachu.
After all, you’ve done it before.	Tukuy imamanta, ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwarqanki.
Fortunately, they agreed.	Ancha kusisqam paykunaqa acuerdopi karqaku.
This was the moment.	Kaymi chay rato karqan.
I couldn’t drive now.	Kunanqa manan carrota manejayta atirqanichu.
Here’s something interesting.	Kaypi huk imapas sumaqmi.
What happened to it.	Imataq pasarqa.
But he never did that with me.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ñoqawanqa chaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
He says now that he would have done it.	Payqa kunanmi nin, chaytaqa ruwanman karqan nispa.
I would love to work with him one day.	Munaymanmi huk punchaw paywan llamkayta.
He says he is still fine.	Payqa kunankamapas allin kasqanmantam nin.
Not me, at least.	Mana ñuqachu, aswanpas.
They are vulnerable and new.	Paykunaqa mana allin qhawarisqa, musuq ima kanku.
I really want to talk.	Chiqaptam rimayta munani.
I don’t care what time of night it is.	Manam imananpaschu ima hora tuta kasqanmantaqa.
Here,’ he says.	Kaypi’, nispas nin.
No one wants this to happen.	Manan pipas munanchu kay hina kananta.
First it was supposed to be half day today.	Ñawpaqtaqa kunan punchawmi kuskan punchaw kanan karqa.
This process was very successful.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I can’t fix it for you.	Manam qampaq allichayta atiymanchu.
It’s still kind of .	Hinallam huk laya .
They were probably fired.	Yaqapaschá qarqosqa karqanku.
The people were.	Runakunaqa karqanku.
But that’s in the past.	Ichaqa chaymi ñawpaq tiempopi.
Lots of time with you.	Achka tiempo qamwan.
He should have been fired a couple of years ago.	Huk iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi qarqusqa kanan karqa.
You know who that person is.	Yachankim pi chay runa kasqanta.
But that is almost the case now.	Ichaqa kunanmi yaqa chayna kachkan.
There’s nothing irrational about it.	Manam imapas mana yuyayniyuqchu chaypiqa.
He’s a sensible guy.	Payqa yuyayniyuqmi.
You’re really good.	Chiqaptam allin kanki.
He knew you had to be out here.	Payqa yacharqanmi kaypi hawapi kanaykita.
I can't be hurt.	Manam k'irisqa kayta atiymanchu.
This guy was good.	Kay runaqa allin kasqa.
I have always thought about this.	Kaypiqa sapa kutim piensarqani.
It’s good, though.	Allinmi ichaqa kan.
Better to have him in it.	Aswan allinmi payta chaypi kananpaq.
You seem very depressed now.	Kunanqa ancha llakisqa hinam kanki.
Make this go away.	Kayta ripunanpaq ruway.
I did a very good job.	Ancha allintam ruwarqani.
From being a child.	Wawa kasqanmanta.
I should have been better.	Aswan allinmi kanay karqa.
He stayed there for a month.	Chaypim huk killa karqa.
Three hours.	Kimsa pacha.
There it says it will be.	Chaypin nin kanqa.
He was really good tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
You know, in a funny way.	Yachanki, huk asikunapaq hina.
And now it’s better to go.	Hinaspa kunanqa aswan allinmi riy.
This will be a process.	Kayqa huk ruwaymi kanqa.
This was the worst ever.	Kayqa sinchi mana allinmi karqan hayk’aqpas.
He learned that this morning.	Chaytaqa kunan paqarinmi yacharqa.
That was really quite difficult.	Chayqa chiqaptam ancha sasa karqa.
Great, great, great.	Hatun, hatun, hatun.
I don't care about that anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
I loved him so much.	Anchatam paytaqa munarqani.
This is not a good way to do that.	Kayqa manam allinchu chayta ruwanapaq.
The people were human beings.	Runakunaqa runam karqaku.
The next step was easy.	Qatiqnin ruwayqa facilmi karqa.
This is what he wants to fix.	Kaytam payqa allichayta munan.
Maybe it should have been me.	Ichapas ñuqa kanan karqa.
That’s a quick look.	Chayqa utqaylla qhawarisqa.
You think it’s not.	Mana chayna kananpaqmi yuyanki.
It actually should have been bigger.	Chiqaptaqa aswan hatunmi kanan karqa.
I was just me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqallam karqani.
I mean, he's not here anymore.	Niyta munani, manañam kaypichu kachkan.
Very strong people.	Ancha sinchi runakuna.
It’s good, it’s nice.	Allinmi, sumaqmi.
Maybe it’s not so bad.	Ichapas mana ancha mana allinchu kanman.
Someone else offered me an immediate job.	Huk runam chaylla llamkayta quwarqa.
This is not difficult to do.	Kayta ruwayqa manam sasachu.
Yeah, yeah, that’s it.	Arí, arí, chaymi.
He was not a very nice man.	Payqa manam ancha sumaq runachu karqa.
How do you know that.	Imaynatataq chayta yachanki.
It’s hard not to do it.	Sasa mana ruwanapaq.
Maybe he can do something.	Ichapas imatapas ruwayta atinman.
Every week is great.	Sapa semana hatunmi.
I thought that was such a stupid thing to do.	Chayqa chhayna sonso ruway kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
You can’t imagine that.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
Nothing could be less true.	Manan imapas aswan pisi cheqaqchu kanman.
This last time though, it didn’t work out.	Kay qhepa kuti ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
This feature will be coming soon.	Kay ruwayqa pisi tiempollamantan hamunqa.
But then, well, it was.	Ichaqa chaymanta, allinmi, chayna karqa.
He was happy now.	Payqa kunanmi kusisqa kasharqan.
He will not be alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kanqa.
But he realized how important it was.	Ichaqa repararqanmi ancha importante kasqanta.
Big, ugly stuff.	Hatun, millay imakuna.
It’s a very difficult thing.	Sinchi sasam.
But it looks very funny.	Ichaqa ancha asikunapaq hinam rikchakun.
It’s the best thing in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan allin kaqmi.
There’s a walk around.	Chaypim puriq.
Maybe it was too early.	Ichapas ancha temprano karqa.
You know you’re stupid, man.	Yachanki sonso kasqaykita, runa.
And two, you’re so beautiful.	Hinaspa iskay, ancha sumaqmi kanki.
He said that over and over again.	Chaynataqa sapa kutim nirqa.
Nothing in the world.	Mana kay pachapi imapas.
Tell me, then.	Willaway, chaymanta.
There was nothing there now.	Chaypiqa kunanqa manam imapas karqachu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allin kaqmi.
Here’s an easy one.	Kaypi huk facil kaq.
You are a very good person.	Ancha allin runam kanki.
Not me, but everyone.	Mana ñuqachu, aswanpas llapa runam.
A few times, in fact.	Iskay kimsa kutita, chiqaptaqa.
You have to do what you have to do.	Imatachus ruwanaykita ruwanayki tiyan.
There were two repetitions.	Iskay kuti kutim karqa.
But the truth is, you didn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi, manan chaytachu ruwarqanki.
I couldn't let something like that ever happen.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu chayna imapas haykapipas pasananta.
I know someone like that won't come again.	Yachanim chayna runaqa manaña yapamanta hamunanta.
And then as before.	Hinaspa chaymanta ñawpaq hina.
Everything is where it needs to be.	Tukuy imapas maypichus kanan chaypi kachkan.
Would it have been that easy.	¿Chayna facilchu kanman karqa.
But this will be him and me.	Ichaqa kaymi kanqa paywan ñoqawan.
There will be something for you, at the right time.	Imapas kanqa qampaq, allin tiempopi.
Something was terribly wrong.	Imapas sinchi mana allinmi karqa.
That was obviously not good of him.	Chayqa sut’inmi paymanta mana allinchu karqan.
I look forward to possibly working with you!.	¡Suyachkani ichapas qamwan llamkayta!.
He would have to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
I’m fine, too.	Ñuqapas allinmi kachkani.
Can't wait any longer.	Mana astawan suyayta atinchu.
He told me to do it.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
This would be really useful.	Kayqa chiqaptam allin kanman.
Has no idea who he is.	Mana yuyayniyuqchu pi kasqanmanta.
He wanted the story to be funny.	Payqa chay willakuyta asikunapaq hina kananpaqmi munarqa.
I still feel bad about it.	Kunankamapas chaymantaqa mana allintam sientekuni.
It doesn’t say that.	Manam chaytachu nin.
There are many people.	Achka runakunam kanku.
He wasn’t alone.	Manam sapallanchu karqa.
Otherwise, he couldn't talk about it.	Mana chayqa, manam chaymanta rimayta atirqachu.
Really really difficult.	Chiqap chiqap sasa.
This makes them want to work harder.	Chaywanmi astawan llamkayta munanku.
I know it's wrong.	Yachanim mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
You want good food.	Allin mikhunata munanki.
How did you know?.	¿Imaynatataq yacharqanki?.
But you have to do it accordingly.	Ichaqa chayman hinan ruwanayki.
You stupid, stupid boy.	Qan sonso, sonso wayna.
Hopefully, that made sense.	Munaymanmi, chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
Maybe he’ll go talk to her.	Ichapas paywan rimaq rinqa.
He can't walk.	Payqa manam puriyta atinchu.
I tried to prolong them.	Chaykunataqa unayta ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
That’s what we had to do instead.	Chaytan ruwanayku karqan aswanpas.
Instead, you can do it.	Aswanpas qanmi chayta ruwawaq.
This was not always true.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu chiqap karqa.
Maybe he would have.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwanman karqa.
Yes, they are that foolish.	Arí, chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
Nobody wanted that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
There was something familiar about it.	Chaypim imapas riqsisqa kaq karqa.
It was a shallow one.	Chayqa mana ancha hatunmi karqa.
But they certainly are not.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu kanku.
He wants her to hurry.	Payqa munanmi usqhaylla ruwananta.
Yes, they were there.	Arí, chaypim karqaku.
It’s not hard, really.	Manam sasachu, chiqaptaqa.
I just want to know why.	Chayllam yachayta munani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He’s obviously upset.	Payqa sut’inmi phiñasqa kashan.
We did that the day before.	Chaytaqa ñawpaq p’unchaymi ruwarqayku.
I don’t think it would be right not to.	Manam allinchu kanman mana chaytaqa piensanichu.
That’s all you can have.	Chayllam qampaq kanman.
Unfortunately he was wrong.	Llakikuypaqmi pantasqa karqa.
I can’t tell you everything.	Manan tukuy imatapas willayta atiymanchu.
That you are truly with us in this world.	Chiqaptapuni kay pachapi ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita.
We can’t say anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas niyta atichwanchu.
He didn’t want to hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu puriyta munarqan.
Such an approach would be extremely unreasonable.	Chayna ruwayqa sinchi mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Two weeks later, here he was.	Iskay semana qhepamanmi kaypi kasharqan.
The rich child.	Qhapaq wawa.
That's pretty frequent.	Chayqa ancha sapa kutim.
Everyone knows who he is.	Lliwmi yachanku pi kasqanmanta.
Yes, he got it.	Arí, payqa chaytan chaskirqan.
These two.	Kay iskay.
I couldn’t stand anything.	Manam imatapas aguantayta atirqanichu.
But it's great, anyway.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi, imayna kaptinpas.
He wanted her to be happy.	Payqa munarqanmi kusisqa kananta.
This thing is pretty impressive.	Kay imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi.
The right person at the right time.	Allin runa allin tiempopi.
But it was great.	Ichaqa hatunmi karqa.
It does almost anything.	Yaqa tukuy imatam ruwan.
Thus    .	Kayna .
She was excited, but nervous.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan, ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
There is usually a time to act.	Yaqa llapanpim kan imatapas ruwanapaq tiempo.
Tom thought the same thing.	Tompas chaytan yuyaykurqan.
It’s been there for a long time.	Unayñam chaypi kachkan.
Tell him to leave.	Allinta niy ripunanpaq.
It’s been that long.	Chayna unayñam.
But that was all, the only thing he did.	Ichaqa chayllam karqa, chaylla ruwasqanqa.
Someone will this week.	Pipas kay semanapi ruwanqa.
He looked worried now.	Payqa kunanqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
I was a bit of a player.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan pukllaqmi karqani.
He couldn’t say anything.	Payqa manan ima niyta atirqanchu.
Yes, he is worthless.	Arí, payqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
In about a week.	Huk semanapi hina.
There is great beauty there.	Chaypiqa hatun sumaq kaymi kachkan.
Second, don’t be stupid.	Iskay kaq, ama sonso kaychu.
There he spoke well.	Chaypin payqa allinta rimarqan.
Maybe they were married, maybe not.	Ichapas casarasqa karqaku, manapaschá.
I’ve never heard that phrase before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay rimayta uyarirqanichu ñawpaqtaqa.
Another very good thing.	Huk ancha allin kaq.
But nothing was going to happen immediately.	Ichaqa manan imapas chayllachu kanan karqan.
Yes, by doing something else.	Arí, hukta ruwaspa.
Today you will learn the sure way.	Kunan punchawmi chay seguro ñanta yachanki.
He’s the last one.	Payqa qhepa kaqmi.
There was greatness here.	Kaypiqa hatun kaymi karqa.
I don't know how that happened.	Manam yachanichu imayna chayna kasqanta.
I’m not sure he knows.	Manam segurochu kani yachasqanmanta.
That’s why you need to do this.	Chayraykum kayta ruwanayki.
He had been very instructive this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi anchata yachachiq kasqa.
Still, something was wrong.	Chayna kaptinpas, imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He was the one who got hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa kaqmi karqan.
Another bad day.	Huk mana allin punchaw.
One night, one day.	Huk tuta, huk punchaw.
Something is quite wrong.	Imapas allintam mana allinchu.
I’m sorry you can’t.	Mana atiwaqchu nispaymi llakikuni.
Not in this greatness.	Mana hatun kaypichu.
That would take about a year.	Chaypaqqa huk wata hinan kanman.
The first was three years ago.	Ñawpaq kaqmi karqan kinsa wata ñawpaqta.
You know the way.	Qamqa ñanta yachanki.
A repeat of that would be a good idea tonight.	Chayta yapamanta ruwayqa kunan tuta allinmi kanman.
Everyone was really great to me.	Lliwmi chiqap hatun karqaku ñuqapaq.
I like that girl.	Chay sipasmi gustan.
Agree that it’s a mistake.	Pantasqa kasqanmanta acuerdopi kay.
He is always recognized.	Payqa sapa kutim riqsisqa.
I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were someone else.	Pampachaykuway, mana yacharqanichu huk runa kasqaykita.
So everything was fine.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allin karqa.
He still can't stand it.	Payqa kunankamapas manam aguantayta atinchu.
Maybe it doesn’t make sense.	Ichapas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
That’s how it happened, which is crazy.	Chaynatam pasarqa, chayqa loco.
I look forward to working with you.	Suyachkani qamwan llamkayta.
It wasn't any worse than this.	Manam aswan mana allinchu karqa kaymantaqa.
Maybe it was.	Ichapas karqa.
But this will be two nights alone.	Ichaqa kayqa iskay tutam sapallan kanqa.
He may be able to play this week.	Payqa ichapas kay semanapi pukllayta atinman.
I really wanted to succeed right away.	Anchatan munarqani chay rato allinta ruwanaypaq.
But he knows it happened, now.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay pasasqanmanta, kunanqa.
That transcends almost everything else.	Chayqa yaqa tukuy imamanta aswan hatunmi.
No one seemed to mind being there.	Manam pipas chaypi kasqanmantaqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
Know what you want.	Yachay ima munasqaykita.
I was very happy with that.	Chaywanqa anchatam kusisqa tarikurqani.
You’ll think about it.	Chaytaqa yuyaykunki.
He said he really was.	Payqa nirqam chiqaptapuni kasqanmanta.
Don’t be a child.	Ama wawa hina kaychu.
I am very sick, very sick.	Ancha unqusqa, ancha unqusqa kani.
I want to figure this out.	Kayta yuyaymanayta munani.
Let’s hope that’s the case here.	Suyasun kaypiqa chayna kananpaq.
It will have to go, that’s all.	Rinan kanqa, chaylla.
I haven’t seen anyone yet.	Manaraqmi pitapas rikurqanichu.
But nothing like that happened, not really.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan, manan cheqaqtachu.
I was sure it would be easy.	Seguro karqani mana sasachu kananmanta.
Loneliness is a bad thing.	Sapallan kayqa mana allin kaqmi.
Now, there is no one here.	Kunanqa, kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.
That means all the time.	Chayqa tukuy tiempo niyta munan.
No one seems to know why.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atiymanchu.
That’s what you want.	Chaynatam munanki.
They were right, in the end.	Paykunaqa allinmi karqanku, tukukuypi.
I'll be fine there.	Allinmi chaypi kasaq.
There were a lot of people there.	Chaypin askha runakuna karqanku.
The failure is not always a bad thing.	Chay mana allin ruwayqa manan sapa kutichu mana allinchu.
But this would be interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa sumaqmi kanman.
It’s almost sensible.	Yaqa yuyayniyuqmi.
After that, not so sure.	Chay qhepamanmi mana chay hina segurochu.
Repeat the first three steps.	Ñawpaq kimsa ruwaykunata yapamanta ruway.
Someone is here.	Pipas kaypi kachkan.
He that night.	Pay chay tuta.
I do this all wrong.	Kaytaqa tukuy mana allintam ruwani.
It might be like this.	Yaqapaschá kay hina kanman.
It just isn’t.	Chaylla manachu.
This felt like the best.	Kayqa aswan allin hinam tarikurqa.
The first is the first.	Ñawpaq kaq ñawpaq kaq.
And then it wasn't good.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa mana allinchu karqa.
I don't know how to handle this much money.	Manam yachanichu kay achka qullqita imayna hapiyta.
He doesn’t want her to know.	Mana munanchu yachananta.
And then, it’s easy.	Hinaspa chaymanta, facilmi.
I thought, that's the best thing.	Yuyarqanim, chaymi aswan allinqa.
But then, maybe he wouldn’t.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas mana ruwanmanchu.
What is it now? 	¿Imataq kunan?
I want to look pretty.	Munani sumaq rikchayniyuq kayta.
No more anyone else.	Manañam manaña pipas.
I really don’t see how that would work.	Chiqamanta mana rikunichu imaynatachus chay allin kanman chayta.
And where.	Hinaspa maypi.
I hope it’s a big success.	Suyachkani hatun allin kananpaq.
Better that way, better that way.	Aswan allin chayna, aswan allin chayna.
And so, such a one.	Hinaspa chayna, chayna huk.
This is really crazy.	Kayqa chiqap loco.
That is the real truth.	Chayqa cheqaq cheqaq kaqmi.
And we had to do a lot of those things.	Hinaspa chay ruwaykunata achkata ruwanayku karqa.
He will do this over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi ruwanqa.
He said, and so did I.	Payqa nisqa, ñuqapas.
That is, today is a good day.	Chayqa, kunan punchawmi allin punchaw.
He knows this sound well.	Payqa allintam yachan kay uyariyta.
I want to get rid of him.	Paymanta lluqsiyta munani.
I don’t want that to happen to him.	Manam munanichu paywan chayna kananta.
He was not good tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa manam allinchu karqa.
But he can’t stay long.	Ichaqa manan unaytachu qhepakuyta atin.
It could very well be that one.	Ancha allintam chay huknin kanman.
I couldn’t think about it now.	Manam kunanqa chaypi yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
The truth is, he knows it all too well.	Cheqaq kaqmi, payqa allintan yachan chaytaqa.
I didn’t want to leave him.	Manam payta saqiyta munarqanichu.
It means you can’t do more than that.	Niyta munan mana chaymanta aswan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I’m not a nobody.	Ñuqaqa mana pipas kani.
So, very, very tired.	Chaymi, ancha, ancha sayk’usqa.
You can do that right now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwawaq.
Nothing too crazy right now.	Mana imapas ancha loco kunanpacha.
The man was depressed.	Chay runaqa llakisqa kasqa.
That was the only thing.	Chayqa chaylla karqa.
Mary did her best.	Mariaqa tukuy atisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
He doesn’t care why.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imarayku.
He looked at the city.	Payqa llaqtata qhawarirqan.
Which was terrible.	Imataq manchay karqa.
This was loneliness.	Kayqa sapallan kaymi karqa.
It could be a problem later.	Qhepamanmi sasachakuy kanman.
Everything is anonymous.	Tukuy imapas mana sutiyuq.
If if .	Sichus sichus .
And he stayed there .	Hinan chaypi qhepakurqan .
But for some reason he couldn’t.	Ichaqa imaraykupas manan atirqanchu.
I want to know him.	Payta yachayta munani.
You are the new me.	Qamqa musuq ñuqam kanki.
I hear him a few times.	Paytaqa iskay kimsa kutitam uyarini.
It really does.	Chiqaptam ruwan.
An hour passed, then two.	Huk hora pasarqa, chaymanta iskay.
It’s not that we can’t.	Manam mana atichwanchu.
It was so big, so beautiful.	Ancha hatunmi karqa, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It’s not bad, but it’s not good.	Manam mana allinchu, ichaqa manam allinchu.
He was a part of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta hukninmi karqa.
He was so excited to go.	Payqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan rinanpaq.
You might be just as good.	Qampas chayna allin kanman.
It doesn’t matter though.	Manam imananpaschu ichaqa.
You think you are right.	Qamqa allintam nisqaykita yuyanki.
But better isn’t always better.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu aswan allinqa aswan allinqa.
And everything will be fine.	Hinaspa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
She, well, she was amazing.	Payqa, allinmi, payqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
She was so beautiful.	Payqa llumpay sumaqmi karqa.
Now it would be soon, he knew.	Kunanqa pisi tiempollamantan kanqa, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
Being a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runa kay.
Being a human being.	Runa kaspa.
But, he really needs it.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin necesitan.
Yeah that’s it.	Arí chaymi chay.
Some of the action was great.	Wakin ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He has no reason.	Payqa manan imaraykupas kanchu.
I'm not sure what happened to this.	Manam segurochu kani kaymanta ima pasasqanmanta.
Here’s the next one.	Kaypi qatiqnin.
He says he can't remember.	Mana yuyariyta atinchu nin.
I am almost too happy now.	Kunanqa yaqa llumpay kusisqam kachkani.
They really want that to happen.	Chayqa anchatam munanku chay pasananta.
That was kind of bad.	Chayqa huk laya mana allinmi karqa.
He had no idea what was going to happen to him today.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kunan p’unchay imachus paywan pasananta.
Only you know about this, now.	Qamllam kaymanta yachanki, kunanqa.
He knows that’s the case.	Payqa yachanmi chayta.
And this is here.	Hinaspa kay kaypi.
Again this is too little action too late.	Yapamanta kayqa ancha pisi ruway ancha tarde.
But maybe he couldn’t.	Ichaqa ichapas mana atirqachu.
Instead, it doesn’t matter.	Aswanpas ama imananpaschu.
Some other three people.	Wakin huk kimsa runakuna.
That was the first time.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq kutita.
You'll be faster.	Aswan utqayllam kanki.
So this is what we did.	Chaymi kayta ruwarqayku.
She longed to be home.	Payqa wasinpi kaytam anchata munarqa.
The phrase was easy.	Chay rimayqa facilmi karqa.
Really, really wrong.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta pantasqa.
I hear just about everything.	Yaqa tukuy imatam uyarini.
But the man is.	Ichaqa chay runaqa.
He would never be ready.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas listochu kanman.
In fact, this makes it worse.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa aswan mana allintam ruwan.
I’m happy with that.	Chaywanmi kusisqa tarikuni.
He wasn't sure what to make of her.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imatachus paymanta ruwananta.
It’s all good really.	Tukuy allinmi chiqaptapuni.
The truth is, it probably is.	Cheqaq kaqmi, yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
Certainly not anymore.	Chiqamanta manaña.
From being tired.	Sayk’usqa kaymanta.
And that is what we should do.	Hinaspa chaynatam ruwananchik.
I’m not that kind of person at all.	Manam chayna runachu kani ni imapipas.
Do some studying later.	Qhepamanmi estudiayta ruway.
But no one ever will.	Ichaqa manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwanqachu.
I wish he would.	Munaymanmi chayta ruwananta.
I mean there will be three.	Kimsa kanqa nispaymi.
Now he can do nothing.	Kunanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
Tonight is not going to be good.	Kunan tutaqa manam allinchu kanqa.
And that’s absurd.	Hinaspa chayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
I think, really, she’s wonderful.	Yuyaykuni, chiqaptapuni, payqa ancha sumaqmi.
I want to catch and be caught.	Hap’iyta, hap’isqa kayta munani.
Yes, we are that good.	Arí, chayna allinmi kanchik.
This will fail.	Kayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
I didn’t always do that.	Manam sapa kutichu chayta ruwarqani.
Hopefully, it was good.	Munaymanmi, allinmi karqa.
He wasn’t up to it yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chayman hinachu kasqa.
That it wasn’t right.	Mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
Next week, next month.	Hamuq semana, hamuq killa.
So this was a big deal.	Chaymi kayqa hatun ruway karqa.
But it had to be quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
In fact, twenty to be exact.	Chiqaptaqa, iskay chunka chiqap kananpaq.
It has always been huge.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi hatun hatun karqa.
He will not be alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kanqa.
He was angry and sad.	Payqa phiñasqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
I was never that kind of person.	Manam haykapipas chayna runachu karqani.
It certainly wasn’t like him.	Cheqaqtapunin mana pay hinachu karqan.
I’m asking myself now.	Kunanmi tapukuni.
He couldn't tell her anything.	Payqa manam imatapas willayta atirqachu.
He had no reason to.	Payqa manan imaraykupas karqanchu.
I don’t know what to do with him now.	Manam yachanichu kunan paywan ima ruwanayta.
But this is happening fast.	Ichaqa kayqa usqhayllan kashan.
But this is the older one.	Ichaqa kaymi kuraq kaq.
It would probably do well.	Yaqapaschá allinta ruwanman.
She was a smart girl.	Payqa yachaysapa sipasmi karqan.
And the world.	Hinaspa kay pacha.
Learn why it is important.	Yachay imarayku ancha allin kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t go outside.	Manam hawaman lluqsiyta atirqanichu.
He says everything is fine.	Payqa tukuy imapas allinmi nin.
That was a nice surprise.	Chayqa sumaq admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Yes, it’s mine.	Arí, ñuqapa.
They were very smart and efficient people.	Paykunaqa ancha yachaysapa hinaspa allin ruwaq runakunam karqaku.
If it’s true, that’s it.	Chiqap kaptinqa, chaymi.
It could be worse by now.	Kunankamaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
He was probably nervous.	Payqa yaqapaschá mancharisqa kasharqan.
He used to .	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa .
In fact, that was not the case.	Aswanpas chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Hungry, angry.	Yarqasqa, phiñasqa.
This is that and more.	Kayqa chaymi hinaspa aswan achka.
Something goes tonight.	Imapas kunan tutam rin.
Maybe too young.	Ichapas ancha wayna.
I’m not sure what’s going to happen to him.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna paywan pasananta.
It’s a lot more interesting now.	Kunanqa aswan sumaqmi.
Many people were drunk.	Achka runakunam machasqa karqaku.
He wouldn’t do it again, ever.	Payqa manañan hukmanta ruwanmanchu karqan, hayk’aqpas.
A month went by, nothing.	Huk killa pasarqa, mana imapas.
How can he disagree and how can he disagree.	Imaynatataq mana acuerdopichu kanman imaynatataq mana acuerdopichu.
He is afraid of being alone.	Payqa manchakunmi sapallan kayta.
But, he did well anyway.	Ichaqa, imayna kaptinpas allintam ruwarqa.
They want to answer.	Paykunaqa kutichiyta munanku.
Or being a teacher.	Utaq yachachiq kay.
A new reality.	Huk musuq chiqap.
This means you can move faster.	Kayqa niyta munan aswan utqaylla puriyta atisqaykita.
Anyway, forgive me.	Imayna kaptinpas, pampachaykuway.
But then again, maybe that’s the problem.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas chay sasachakuy kanman.
And then, we really agree.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa, chiqaptam acuerdopi kayku.
I expect a bit of a challenge.	Suyachkani huk chikan sasachakuy.
He's been through this before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi kaytaqa pasarqa.
Both are in jail.	Iskayninkum carcelpi kachkanku.
You never know what’s going to happen next.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus qhepaman pasananta.
He knows how he feels.	Payqa yachanmi chayna sientekusqanmanta.
I mean, it was all day.	Niyta munani, tukuy punchawmi karqa.
It would mean a lot.	Anchatam niyta munanman.
But it really depends on the country.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chay nacionmanta kanqa.
That’s right, it’s set up.	Chayqa allinmi, churasqa kachkan.
Monday was a bad day.	Lunes punchawqa mana allin punchawmi karqa.
He says he might be one himself.	Pay kikin huknin kanman nispa nin.
What a teacher he was.	Ima yachachiqmi karqan.
This is going to be worse than that.	Kayqa chaymanta aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
Not sure why it works for you.	Mana segurochu imarayku qampaq allin kasqanmanta.
This was me .	Kayqa ñuqam karqani.
This was really too late.	Kayqa chiqamanta ancha tarde karqa.
No one can say that.	Manan pipas chay hinata niyta atinmanchu.
Maybe it was the food itself.	Ichapas kikin mikhuy karqa.
He knew this was tough.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa sinchi sasa kasqanmanta.
Everyone wants to be here.	Lliwmi kaypi kayta munanku.
I knew today was going to be hard.	Yacharqanim kunan punchaw sasa kananta.
These are really smart people.	Kaykunaqa chiqaptam yachaysapa runakuna.
I am not ready now.	Kunanqa manam listochu kachkani.
That’s what you said.	Chaytaqa qanmi nirqanki.
But there’s something about you.	Ichaqa kanmi imapas qanmanta.
He or I.	Pay icha ñuqa.
That didn't seem right.	Chayqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
You are a beautiful person every day.	Sapa punchawmi sumaq runa kanki.
They all want money.	Llapallankum qullqita munanku.
This is quick and easy.	Kayqa utqaylla hinaspa mana sasachu.
Repeat the process over and over again.	Yapamanta yapamanta ruway.
He was half crazy.	Payqa kuskan loco kasqa.
I don’t know who that kid is.	Manam yachanichu pichus chay wawa kasqanmanta.
He can’t see it.	Payqa manan rikuyta atinchu.
It’s amazing what a person can do without anything.	Admirakuypaqmi imatachus huk runa mana ima ruwayta atinman chayta.
I hope this is true.	Suyachkani kayqa chiqap kananpaq.
We are still here today.	Kunankamapas kaypim kachkaniku.
I want to make it funny.	Asikunapaq hina ruwayta munani.
People love food.	Runakunaqa mikhunata anchata munanku.
He seemed sad and angry.	Payqa llakisqa hinaspa phiñasqa hinam karqa.
He knows he can’t eat tonight.	Payqa yachanmi kunan tuta mana mikhuyta atinanmanta.
But, well, good to go.	Ichaqa, allinmi, allinmi riy.
He has always been better than me.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqamanta aswan allin karqa.
Very disappointed with it.	Ancha hukmanyasqa chaywan.
Yesterday was a really hard day for me.	Qayna punchawqa chiqap sasa punchawmi karqa ñuqapaq.
Do it first thing tomorrow.	Paqarin ñawpaqta ruway.
There was so much of it.	Ancha achkatam karqa.
Then half an hour.	Chaymanta kuskan hora.
I wanted to do it right.	Allintam ruwayta munarqani.
I hope you don't.	Suyachkani mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
Really, really hungry.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta yarqasqa.
He would be useful here.	Payqa kaypiqa allinmi kanman.
Now, again, there you go.	Kunanqa, yapamanta, chaypi rinki.
But it was almost as good.	Ichaqa yaqa chayna allin kaqmi karqa.
He is with us now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqaykuwan kuska kachkan.
I always pretended to be angry with him.	Sapa kutim paywan phiñasqa hina ruwaq kani.
And next time it will be, he said.	Hinaspa hamuq kutipi kanqa, nispas nin.
But he didn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa allintachu ruwarqan.
Maybe there is something wrong with me.	Ichapas imapas mana allin ñuqawan kachkan.
But that would not be true.	Ichaqa chayqa manan cheqaqchu kanman.
But there is no way to do that yet.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa manaraqmi imapas kanchu.
He wasn't like him, he said.	Manam pay hinachu karqa, nispa.
I don’t know why that would happen.	Manam yachanichu imaraykupas chayna kananta.
What, man.	Imataq, runa.
This is a yes.	Kayqa arí.
He was always really smart.	Payqa sapa kutim chiqap yachaysapa karqa.
He went fast, on purpose.	Payqa utqayllam rirqa, munasqanman hina.
Twenty or thirty will do just fine.	Iskay chunka kimsa chunka allinta ruwanqa.
The youngest one.	Sullk’a kaq.
This was like a world.	Kayqa huk pacha hinam karqa.
I knew you could do it.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
You are the greatest thing.	Aswan hatun kaqmi kanki.
He seems very angry about it.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam chaymanta.
Not sure where though.	Mana segurochu maypi ichaqa.
He wasn’t good enough for her.	Payqa manan allinchu karqan paypaq.
He wasn’t sure it was true.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan cheqaq kasqanmanta.
I didn’t realize that.	Chaytaqa manan repararqanichu.
There was no other way.	Manan huk hinaqa karqanchu.
Not here, he said.	Mana kaypichu, nispa.
He was the tallest.	Payqa aswan hatunmi karqa.
The people are.	Runakunaqa.
Everything makes no sense.	Tukuy imapas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
But he is not doing it alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwashan.
Where he went, what he did.	Mayman risqanmanta, ima ruwasqanmanta.
I’ve already said too much.	Ñam llumpayta nirqani.
Eventually I lost track of him.	Qhepamanmi paytaqa manaña yacharqanichu.
Both are adults.	Iskayninkum kuraq runakuna.
I’m not really sure.	Manam chiqaptaqa segurochu kani.
Where, how big, sort of.	Maypi, hayka hatun, huk laya.
But not everything was so happy.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas chhayna kusisqachu karqan.
But, you do it.	Ichaqa, qanmi ruwanki.
He always had something for you.	Payqa sapa kutim qampaq imapas karqa.
I was hungry too.	Ñuqapas yarqasqa.
He can’t be alone in this.	Payqa manan kaypiqa sapallanchu kanman.
There were both of them in the city.	Chay llaqtapiqa iskayninkum karqa.
That was not funny.	Chay nisqanqa manan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
I just heard something.	Chayllaraqmi imatapas uyarirqani.
I mean, seriously, he’s amazing.	Niyta munani, serio, payqa admirakuypaqmi.
It would be easier, after all.	Aswan facilmi kanman, tukuy imamanta.
We always have a lot to do.	Sapa kutim achka ruwananchik kachkan.
You know what a university is.	Yachanki ima hatun yachay wasi kasqanmanta.
But it can’t be everyone.	Ichaqa manan llapa runachu kanman.
Tell me what you know.	Ima yachasqaykita willaway.
And he went yesterday.	Hinaspa qayna punchaw rirqa.
But this will obviously fail.	Ichaqa kayqa sut’inmi mana allintachu ruwanqa.
I am very happy with that.	Chaywanqa anchatam kusisqa kachkani.
Probably something important.	Yaqapaschá imapas importante kaq.
This is usually easy.	Chayqa yaqa llapanpim mana sasachu.
well, who knows.	allin, pi yachan.
He doesn’t know about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas yachanchu.
So quick, easy and safe.	Chaymi utqaylla, facil hinaspa seguro.
He wants to be with me, all the time.	Payqa munanmi ñuqawan kayta, tukuy tiempo.
Two people there.	Iskay runakuna chaypi.
Please note that this is quite a lot.	Ama hina kaspa, kayqa ancha askha kasqanmanta yachay.
I want to talk to someone about this.	Kaymantaqa piwanpas rimayta munani.
But I have to do that.	Ichaqa chaynatam ruwanay kachkan.
Make that movie.	Chay peliculata ruway.
So this is it now.	Chaymi kunan kay.
He doesn’t have much.	Payqa manan anchatachu.
They are very tough.	Paykunaqa ancha sinchitan kanku.
I mean, really, really good.	Niyta munani, chiqap, chiqap allin.
But maybe it is.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna kanman.
I think that is very wrong.	Chayqa ancha mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
They want to fix it.	Paykunaqa allichayta munanku.
He said he really liked it.	Payqa anchatam gustasqanmanta nirqa.
But that was it for him.	Ichaqa chaymi paypaq karqan.
Somewhere black.	Maypipas yana.
Indeed he was.	Chiqaptam payqa karqa.
I hear that a lot.	Chaytaqa achkatam uyarini.
He didn’t think he would win from her.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu paymanta atipananta.
That must be the reality.	Chayqa cheqaq kaqmi kanan.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha hatun karqa.
I didn’t know what to say.	Mana yacharqanichu ima niyta.
Yes, that was it.	Arí, chaymi karqan.
I think he couldn’t hear anything anymore.	Yuyaykuni manaña imatapas uyariyta atisqanmanta.
And we did everything.	Hinaspa tukuy imatapas ruwarqayku.
You think that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yuyanki.
Not good for me.	Mana allin ñuqapaq.
I don’t feel that way.	Manam chaynatachu sientekuni.
Then he began to understand.	Chaymantam entiendeyta qallaykurqa.
He knew they weren't now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan mana kasqankuta.
I’ve been thinking about it for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi yuyaykushani.
I wanted to be like him.	Ñoqapas pay hina kaytan munarqani.
He’s afraid of something.	Payqa imatapas manchakunmi.
There is nothing we can do now.	Kunanqa manañam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
It's really not that big of a deal.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna hatun ruwaychu.
I have to disagree here.	Kaypiqa manam acuerdopichu kanay.
I mean everything.	Tukuy imatam niyta munani.
This was the last one.	Kayqa qhipa kaqmi karqa.
That’s why he was a wanderer.	Chayraykum payqa puriq runa karqa.
It seemed to make more sense.	Aswan yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
Instead, he was right.	Aswanpas payqa allintan rimarqan.
That’s the oldest thing.	Chayqa aswan kuraq kaqmi.
It is not to be done in a hurry.	Manan usqhayllachu ruwana.
I think it was the third.	Kimsa kaq kasqanmantam piensani.
Now people are tired.	Kunanqa runakunaqa sayk’usqañan kashanku.
In fact, nothing of the sort happened.	Aswanpas manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
That’s the real me.	Chay chiqap ñuqa.
It was three months ago.	Kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
I want to know why people want to know why.	Yachayta munani imarayku runakuna yachayta munanku imarayku.
She said, yes please.	Payqa nisqa, arí ama hina kaspa.
It just doesn’t do anything.	Chaylla mana imatapas ruwanchu.
And then people were rude.	Hinaspa chaymanta runakunaqa mana allin ruwaq karqanku.
That’s, nothing.	Chayqa, manam imapas.
This should be really interesting.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanan.
The man himself is worthless.	Kikin runaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
She refuses to believe him.	Payqa manan munanchu payta creeyta.
You’re right there.	Allinmi chaypiqa kanki.
The new one wasn’t good enough.	Musuq mana allinchu karqa.
Therein lies a serious problem.	Chaypin kashan huk hatun sasachakuy.
It could very well be true.	Ancha allintam chiqap kanman.
Don’t ever be a villain.	Ama hayk’aqpas millay runaqa kaychu.
He knew exactly why they were there.	Payqa allintam yacharqa imanasqa chaypi kasqankuta.
I’d love to hear it again.	Hukmanta uyariyta anchata munani.
They certainly know.	Paykunaqa cheqaqtapunin yachanku.
He could not overcome it.	Payqa manam atipayta atirqachu.
Okay, so today was a great day.	Allinmi, chaymi kunan punchawqa hatun punchaw karqa.
It would be quick.	Utqaylla kanman.
Then finally, you do.	Chaymanta tukukuypi, ruwanki.
That lasted about a week.	Chayqa yaqa huk semanan karqan.
But he will do it.	Ichaqa paymi ruwanqa.
He doesn’t have to, but it’s no big deal.	Payqa manan ruwananchu, ichaqa manan hatun ruwaychu.
That will happen in the near future.	Chayqa pisi tiempollamantan kanqa.
Maybe somewhere no one knows.	Ichapas maypipas mana pipas yachanchu.
A cup of coffee.	Huk kukata.
But we did it right.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwarqayku.
I feel like it’s a good thing.	Allin kaqta hinam tarikuni.
First it was baseball.	Ñawpaqtaqa béisbol nisqa karqan.
What is it with him?.	¿Imataq paywan kachkan?.
This process is up to you.	Kay ruwayqa qammanta kanqa.
It’s better out here.	Aswan allinmi kaypi hawapi.
But of course this is wrong.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kayqa mana allinchu.
But this one is.	Ichaqa kay huknin kaqmi.
Nice people though.	Sumaq runakuna ichaqa.
Can't say for sure.	Mana seguro niyta atinchu.
I went on feeling sad.	Llakisqa hinam rirqani.
It’s one of his regular practices.	Chayqa hukninmi sapa kuti ruwasqanmanta.
One cannot have too much of a party.	Huk runaqa manan nishuta hatun fiestata ruwayta atinmanchu.
Now he always quit.	Kunanqa sapa kutim saqirqa.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqañan kasqa.
Probably not, but it looks like it.	Manapaschá, ichaqa chayman rikchakun.
So it’s not a good thing to do.	Chaymi mana ruway allinchu.
Again, he says yes.	Yapamanta arí nin.
It made her feel nervous.	Chayqa mancharisqa hinam tarikurqa.
I’d love to hear about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta uyariyta anchata munani.
He tried to find out where she was.	Payqa kallpachakurqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta yachananpaq.
Almost as long herself afternoon.	Yaqa chayna unayta pay kikin tarde.
That’s an all-time great.	Chayqa tukuy pacha hatunmi.
But again, you know this.	Ichaqa yapamanta, kayta yachanki.
He seemed, if anything, a little nervous.	Payqa, imapas kaptinqa, huk chikan mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He’s terribly good.	Payqa manchay allinmi.
Everyone is happy and rich.	Lliwmi kusisqa, qhapaq ima kanku.
Here’s a little bit.	Kaypi huk chikan.
She looks forward to spending time with him.	Payqa suyanmi paywan tiempota pasananta.
He wanted to be ignored.	Payqa mana qhawarisqa kaytan munarqan.
I would never do that, you know?.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu, ¿yachankichu?.
But it was good, after all.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan, tukuy imamanta.
He was very happy with that.	Chaywanmi payqa ancha kusisqa kasharqan.
Actually, I thought so.	Chiqaptaqa chaytam piensarqani.
Something similar to that.	Chayman rikchakun imapas.
Maybe it’s better.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman.
One of them is right for you.	Hukninmi qampaq allinchu.
I am the unknown.	Ñuqam kani mana riqsisqa.
You are a bad guy.	Qamqa mana allin runam kanki.
You know exactly who you are.	Qamqa allintam yachanki pi kasqaykita.
Here, this is your man.	Kaypi, kayqa qampa runam.
That's a strange thing.	Chayqa huk mana riqsisqa kaqmi.
Nothing to do with it.	Mana imapas ruwanapaq.
He doesn’t deserve to be anywhere.	Payqa manan maypipas kananpaq hinachu.
I’m not really into it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaypi kachkani.
Maybe this was all new to him.	Ichapas kayqa tukuy musuq karqa paypaq.
But this is not so simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kayqa.
But it is likely to happen.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chay hinaqa kanqa.
He spent less than an hour here.	Kaypiqa mana huk hora hinam karqa.
it is here that it is.	kaypim kachkan.
So he’s talking about it here.	Chaymi kaypi rimachkan.
Know that it can be immediate.	Chaylla kayta atisqanmanta yachay.
I made the time pretty well.	Allin allintam tiempota ruwarqani.
He was well caught.	Payqa allintam hapisqa karqa.
I was never really sure.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa segurochu karqani.
I know it looks bad.	Yachanim mana allin rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
But that will likely take some time.	Ichaqa chaypaqqa yaqapaschá huk tiempo kanqa.
But this is the first step.	Ichaqa kaymi ñawpaq kaq ruwayqa.
I am the only stranger in this house.	Ñuqallam kay wasipi mana riqsisqa runa kani.
Is it still?.	¿Hinallaraqchu?.
But it’s not the same as it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaqpi hinachu.
So glad he was okay.	Chaymi kusisqa payqa allin kasqanmanta.
What a surprise it was.	Ima admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I couldn’t speak for long.	Mana unayta rimayta atirqanichu.
As usual, again.	Sapa kuti hina, yapamanta.
I’m sure he hadn’t before that.	Seguro kani manaraq chaymanta ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He drove to town.	Paymi carropi llaqtaman rirqa.
If you do, that’s fine.	Sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
No one was ever right.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
Drunk with it.	Chaywan machasqa.
That was a whole new thing.	Chayqa huk musuq ruwaymi karqa.
That’s not so much like me.	Chayqa manan anchatachu ñoqa hina.
It didn’t quite work out that way.	Manam allintachu chaynata lluqsirqa.
Future, present, past.	Hamuq pacha, kunan, ñawpaq.
I have to do it right.	Allintam ruwanay.
And then this, tonight.	Hinaspa chaymanta kay, kunan tuta.
He was, sort of.	Payqa karqan, huk laya.
Do something right now.	Kunanpacha imatapas ruway.
But he disagreed about anything.	Ichaqa manan acuerdopichu karqan imamantapas.
As always, he will agree.	Sapa kuti hinam, payqa acuerdopi kanqa.
He's not sure why he did it.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan imarayku ruwasqanmanta.
But he certainly is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin payqa kashan.
He was right to say no.	Payqa allintam nirqa mana nispa.
This means beauty.	Kayqa sumaq kay niyta munan.
Go ahead first.	Ñawpaqtaqa riy.
That’s a big player.	Chayqa hatun pukllaqmi.
She was very nice, actually.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
That is why he is the best player in the world.	Chayraykum payqa kay pachapi aswan allin pukllaq.
Yes you did, great man.	Arí ruwarqanki, hatun runa.
He is not today.	Payqa manam kunan punchawchu.
It wasn't really that big of a deal.	Manam chiqaptaqa chayna hatun ruwaychu karqa.
Can’t see anyone else.	Mana hukta rikuyta atinchu.
But nowadays it is not so easy.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan chay hina facilchu.
That would have been a nice thing to do.	Chayqa sumaq ruwaymi kanman karqan.
But he never wanted to.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas munarqanchu.
The man seemed angry.	Chay runaqa phiñasqa hinam karqa.
Now be easy, easy.	Kunanqa facil kay, facil.
But it should be better.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanan.
That seems pretty safe.	Chayqa allin seguro hinam kachkan.
And here they were.	Hinaspa kaypi karqanku.
You’re like a drunk.	Machasqa hinam kanki.
Maybe once a week or something.	Ichapas semanapi huk kutita utaq imapas.
First I knew what it was.	Ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanim ima kasqanmanta.
He allowed this.	Payqa kaytam saqirqa.
For some reason this is very difficult.	Imaraykupas kayqa ancha sasam.
Otherwise, the claim is irrelevant.	Mana chayqa, chay nisqanqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
It wasn’t all there.	Manam tukuy chaypichu karqa.
It was out there.	Chay hawapi kasqa.
I think he probably never will.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu, chaytan yuyaykuni.
I don’t feel comfortable anymore.	Manañam allintachu sientekuni.
He came, looking stern.	Payqa hamurqa, sinchi rikchayniyuq.
I thought for a while.	Huk rato yuyaykurqani.
There were more people.	Aswan achka runakunam karqa.
No one here is happy about what happened.	Kaypiqa manam pipas kusisqachu kachkan chay pasasqanmantaqa.
They seemed smarter than me.	Paykunaqa ñuqamanta aswan yachaysapa hinam karqaku.
If you know how, let me know.	Imaynatataq yachanki chayqa, willaway.
I can eat later.	Qhepamanmi mikhuyta atiyman.
But very quickly there is nothing left.	Ichaqa ancha usqhayllan manaña imapas kanchu.
I can do that later.	Qhepamanmi chaytaqa ruwayman.
But sadly this will never happen.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana hayk’aqpas kanqachu.
Really really rich.	Chiqap chiqap qhapaq.
He can’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwayta atin.
It’s a very bad thing to do.	Ancha millay ruwaymi.
It could have been so easy.	Ancha facilmi kanman karqa.
This statement makes good sense.	Kay rimayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
It probably went too far.	Yaqapaschá llumpayta rirqa.
Doing it again this morning.	Kunan paqarin yapamanta ruwaspa.
We have to make the first discovery.	Ñawpaq kaq tariyta ruwananchik tiyan.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
He's constantly injured.	Payqa sapa kutim k'irisqa kachkan.
That's hard when someone does that.	Chayqa sasam pipas chaynata ruwaptinqa.
Of course, this would be absurd.	Arí, kayqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
This does not take long.	Chaypaqqa manan unaytachu ruwana.
I can’t say yes or no.	Manam arí nitaq mana niyta atiymanchu.
I didn’t want to know anything more.	Manam imatapas astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
He wasn’t happy about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas kusisqachu kasqa.
Something went well.	Allinmi imapas pasarqa.
Not then anyway.	Mana chaymanta imayna kaptinpas.
There was a lot of it.	Achkatam karqa.
Eleven more.	Chunka hukmanta.
He’s not sure what he’s going to do now.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan kunan ima ruwananmanta.
It will be a good thing to do.	Allin ruwaymi kanqa.
He looked at his house.	Payqa wasinta qhawarisqa.
One of the hidden.	Huknin pakasqa.
Doing nothing is doing something else.	Mana imatapas ruwayqa huk hina ruwaymi.
But you are very beautiful.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi kanki.
The more the merrier.	Aswan achka kaptinqa aswan kusisqam.
He’s a really tough guy.	Payqa chiqap sinchi runam.
Do that task first.	Chay ruwayta ñawpaqta ruway.
That’s hard, but it’s worth it.	Chayqa sasam, ichaqa allinmi.
I can’t seem to do things right.	Manapaschá allintachu imatapas ruwayta atiyman hina.
Bad day for you! 	¡Mana allin punchaw qampaq!
That he is.	Payqa kasqanmanta.
No one knows where they are.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi kasqankuta.
I have to be there.	Chaypim kanay.
I certainly wasn’t happy.	Cheqaqtapunin mana kusisqachu karqani.
Indeed, there is such a thing.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hinaqa kan.
I’m not as good as that person.	Manam chay runa hina allinchu kani.
Not me, it’s him.	Mana ñuqachu, pay.
She’s a great girl, she is.	Payqa hatun sipasmi, payqa.
And to make it better.	Hinaspa aswan allinta ruwanapaq.
I saw him there often.	Chaypiqa sapa kutillanmi paytaqa rikurqani.
But tonight he is out.	Ichaqa kunan tutan hawapi kashan.
Now that’s the new one.	Kunanqa chay musuq.
For a difference.	Huk chikan kananpaq.
He doesn’t seem to want a real answer.	Payqa manan cheqaq kutichiyta munanman hinachu.
Next week then.	Hamuq semana chaymanta.
Strong but good.	Sinchi ichaqa allin.
But you don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachankichu.
I am the one to speak.	Ñuqam kani rimanaypaq.
He is in a very difficult situation.	Payqa sinchitan tarikun.
He couldn’t get out.	Manam lluqsiyta atirqachu.
Right now, actually.	Kunanpacha, chiqaptaqa.
It’s not as hard as it should be.	Manan chay hina sasachu kanan hina.
This was about two months ago.	Kayqa karqan yaqa iskay killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
It was what it was supposed to be.	Imayna kananpaqmi karqa.
You are the one to succeed.	Qanmi kanki allinta ruwanaykipaqqa.
Seriously, be happy.	Serio, kusisqa kay.
And anyway, the man is worse.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas, chay runaqa aswan mana allinmi.
We are good for that.	Chaypaqqa allinmi kayku.
I was so terribly tired and hungry.	Ancha manchay sayk’usqa, yarqasqa ima karqani.
I don't understand what it's like.	Manam entiendenichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
They are crazy people.	Paykunaqa loco runakunam.
I didn’t want him to repeat the night before.	Manam munarqanichu ñawpaq tutamanta yapamanta ruwananta.
They were pretty injured.	Paykunaqa sumaq k’irisqa karqanku.
In fact, maybe that’s what should have been done.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas chayna ruwana karqa.
That seems to be where the action lies.	Chaypim chay ruwayqa kanman hina.
To be like me.	Ñuqa hina kananpaq.
You don’t want to eat.	Manam mikhuyta munankichu.
There were too many people.	Llumpay achka runakunam karqa.
It wasn't supposed to be that hard.	Manam chayna sasachu kanan karqa.
I certainly didn’t want to do that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
This was too fast.	Kayqa llumpay utqayllam karqa.
I’m a little worried.	Huk chhikantan llakisqa kashani.
A confusing process.	Huk pantasqa ruway.
He had no idea what he would do next.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu qhepaman ima ruwananta.
He must be bigger than me.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan hatunmi kanan.
But maybe he will.	Ichaqa ichapas ruwanqa.
So it’s not difficult.	Chayraykum mana sasachu.
It really was something.	Chiqaptam imapas karqa.
I have so many ideas.	Ancha achka yuyayniyuqmi kani.
And the movie.	Hinaspa chay peliculata.
It was about a year ago.	Yaqa huk wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
That was all that mattered.	Chayllam importante karqa.
We’re not there anymore.	Manañam chaypichu kachkaniku.
I don’t have anyone either.	Ñuqapas manam pitapas kanchu.
That’s not really funny.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu asikunapaq hina.
Clearly something was wrong there.	Sut’inmi chaypi imapas mana allin kasharqan.
Here he thought it would never happen.	Kaypiqa yuyaykurqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayna kananta.
I can’t seem to figure out the problem.	Manapaschá chay sasachakuymanta yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
It would have been me.	Ñuqam kanman karqa.
I don’t want to be a bad guy.	Manam millay runa kayta munanichu.
They were totally uncomfortable.	Paykunaqa tukuy imapipas mana allinchu karqanku.
I don’t know how to talk about him.	Manam yachanichu paymanta rimayta.
But you are a smart girl.	Ichaqa yachaysapa sipasmi kanki.
It was a beautiful day, beautiful.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa, sumaqmi.
This process continues.	Kay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
He wasn't sure if he would.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwananta icha manachus chayta.
Like last time.	Qayna kuti hina.
I think that’s probably a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá allin kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
Otherwise, he can do it alone.	Mana chayqa, sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwanman.
That was the craziest thing.	Chayqa aswan loco kaqmi karqan.
Everything there looks great.	Chaypi kaq tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Maybe he’s a nice guy.	Ichapas payqa sumaq runa.
Be that way if you have to.	Chay hina kay sichus ruwanayki kanqa chayqa.
That’s why you’re alone.	Chayraykum sapallayki kachkanki.
Unfortunately, he can't get a full-time job.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam sapa punchaw llamkayta tariyta atinchu.
That's just ridiculous.	Chayqa asikunapaq hinallam.
Someone else has to do it a while.	Huk runam huk rato ruwanan.
Maybe you were there, maybe you weren’t.	Ichapas chaypi karqanki, manapaschá.
So it really depends on what it is.	Chaymi cheqaqtapuni ima kasqanmantan kanqa.
So far, I think that's all.	Kunankamaqa chaylla kasqanmantam piensani.
I wasn’t sure he could.	Manam segurochu karqani atisqanmanta.
It’s still a human being.	Hinallam runa.
Like, really really late.	Imayna, chiqap chiqap tarde.
That may not be the only thing.	Chayqa manapaschá chayllachu kanqa.
I did it every time.	Sapa kutim ruwarqani.
And then he said something really strange.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa chiqap mana riqsisqa kaqta nirqa.
Maybe you think you do.	Ichapas chayta ruwasqaykita yuyanki.
Past, present, future.	Ñawpaq, kunan, hamuq pacha.
But I won’t disagree with that.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa mana acuerdopichu kasaq.
That is the best thing for you.	Chayqa qampaq aswan allin kaqmi.
Now, it didn't seem like much.	Kunanqa, mana anchatachu rikchakurqa.
Then one this afternoon.	Chaymanta huk kunan tarde.
I, for one, wanted to believe him.	Ñoqaqa, hukninmi, payta creeyta munarqani.
But he, yes, knew.	Ichaqa payqa, arí, yacharqanmi.
Do that, first.	Chayta ruway, ñawpaqta.
They're better off in the hospital, anyway.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi hospitalpi, imayna kaptinpas.
I mean, thank you so much .	Niyta munani, anchata gracias .
Who knows what it is.	Pitaq yachan.
Ever, if he can help it.	Hayk’aqllapas, sichus yanapayta atinman chayqa.
What happened next.	Imataq chaymanta pasarqa.
Tired, very tired.	Sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa.
He refused to drive.	Payqa manan carropi riyta munarqanchu.
In any case, there is nothing we can do.	Imayna kaptinpas manam imatapas ruwayta atichwanchu.
No one wanted to talk to you.	Manan pipas qanwan rimayta munarqanchu.
Such a bad time.	Chayna mana allin tiempo.
You can’t work.	Mana llamk’ayta atiwaqchu.
It wasn’t difficult at all.	Manam sasachu karqa ni imapipas.
Ten years ago there were three.	Chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa kimsa karqa.
You probably don’t want that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa mana munankichu.
The process, however, is difficult.	Chay ruwaymi ichaqa sasa.
I, too, don’t like it.	Ñuqapas, manam gustanchu.
Why yes, they are.	Imaraykutaq arí, chayna kanku.
He was a stranger.	Payqa huk mana riqsisqa runam karqa.
I didn’t notice anything at all.	Manam imatapas repararqanichu ni imapipas.
Here’s how it went.	Kaypi imayna rirqa.
Very impressed to say the least.	Ancha admirasqa niyta.
Go there right away.	Chaylla chayman riy.
How does it do that?	Imaynatataq chayta ruwan.
They are there first year.	Paykunaqa chaypim kachkanku ñawpaq wata.
He’s never in a hurry.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu.
He never does, you know.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanchu, yachanki.
I just couldn’t sleep.	Chaylla mana puñuyta atirqanichu.
He obviously couldn’t.	Payqa sut’inmi mana atirqanchu.
He seemed very happy to be here.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
People know that.	Runakuna chayta yachanku.
Doesn't seem right, does it.	Manam allinchu rikchakun, ¿aw.
What about what.	Imamanta ima.
They’re not.	Paykunaqa mana.
We all talked to him.	Llapanchismi paywan rimaq kayku.
I should be good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kanay.
Not as good as mine, but great.	Mana ñuqa hina allinchu, ichaqa ancha allinmi.
There will be plenty of time for that later.	Chaypaqqa qhepamanmi askha tiempo kanqa.
Evil, evil, evil man.	Millay, millay, millay runa.
I take this seriously.	Kaytaqa allintam hapini.
What a day this was.	Ima punchawmi kayqa karqa.
That means he’s really, really good.	Chayqa niyta munan payqa chiqap, chiqap allin kasqanmanta.
I want this to be beautiful.	Kay sumaq kananta munani.
Black time.	Yana pacha.
They know things.	Paykunaqa imakunatapas yachanku.
Can't remember what.	Mana yuyariyta atinchu imata.
You want to solve every problem.	Sapa sasachakuy allichayta munanki.
Really, really fast.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta usqhaylla.
She refused, but he did.	Payqa manan munarqanchu, paymi ichaqa munarqan.
He's actually a great guy.	Payqa chiqaptaqa hatun runam.
I can’t seem to figure it out.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
He seems tired and frustrated about something.	Imamantapas sayk’usqa, hukmanyasqa hinam kachkan.
It means the world to me.	Niyta munan kay pacha ñuqapaq.
I mean, it’s pretty amazing.	Niyta munani, ancha admirakuypaqmi.
Very good though, very good.	Ancha allinmi ichaqa, ancha allin.
The next hour.	Qatiqnin hora.
I’ll be fine! 	¡Allin kasaq!
That sounds bad.	Chayqa mana allinmi uyarikun.
But it’s not bad at all.	Ichaqa manan imapipas mana allinchu.
He had no idea who would be there.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu pikuna chaypi kananta.
I really didn’t do anything.	Chiqaptaqa manam imatapas ruwarqanichu.
They were like night and day.	Paykunaqa tuta punchaw hinam karqaku.
This is the	Kaytaqa .
Better, but not quite.	Aswan allin, ichaqa mana allintachu.
He wanted to know, despite himself.	Payqa yachayta munarqa, pay kikin kaptinpas.
I am really very excited.	Chiqaptam ancha kusisqa kachkani.
This wouldn’t be a good thing.	Kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
They weren’t intelligent.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqaku.
I can do it right away.	Chayllam ruwayman.
I wasn’t there that day.	Chay punchawqa manam chaypichu karqani.
Better to do something.	Aswan allinmi imatapas ruway.
He passed the car.	Payqa carrota pasarqa.
It should have been fine at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa allintan kanan karqan.
She says she has no choice.	Payqa ninmi mana ima ruwaytapas atisqanmanta.
But we did half of it.	Ichaqa kuskan chayta ruwarqayku.
Better go and.	Aswan allinmi riy hinaspa.
No, no, of course not.	Manan, manan, sut’inmi mana.
So it’s not a good idea to talk outside.	Chaymi hawapi rimayqa mana allinchu.
You know what.	Yachanki imakuna.
But here's the other thing.	Ichaqa kaypi huknin kaqmi kachkan.
I really wanted you to be real.	Anchatam munarqani chiqap kanaykita.
I feel like he does.	Pay hinam sientekuni.
I always refuse.	Sapa kutim mana munanichu.
How you want to help.	Imaynatam yanapayta munanki.
They are all extremely difficult.	Llapallankum sinchi sasa kanku.
But he plans to be bigger than that.	Ichaqa chaymanta aswan hatun kananta yuyaykushan.
Who is? 	¿Pitaq?
I think that’s a good thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa allinmi kanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
He realized he needed help.	Payqa repararqanmi yanapayta necesitasqanmanta.
Black does what he has to do to succeed.	Yana ruwan ima ruwananta allinta ruwananpaq.
But it’s not that fucking easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu millay facilchu.
It should continue to be so.	Chaytaqa hinallam kanan.
It was a terrific experience.	Chayqa sinchi admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He is still doing it.	Payqa kunankamapas chaytam ruwachkan.
It really is faster.	Chiqaptam aswan utqaylla.
I have never, ever done that.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas chaytaqa ruwarqanichu.
Do everything you say you’re going to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanaykipaq nisqaykita ruway.
I didn’t know what he was going to do with it.	Manam yacharqanichu chaywan ima ruwananta.
A very bad guy.	Ancha mana allin runa.
Obviously that wasn’t the case.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
But the truth set in.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi haykurqan.
Maybe I don’t see anything.	Ichapas mana imatapas rikunichu.
There are people who are being fired now.	Kanmi runakuna kunan qarqusqa kachkanku.
They were very serious.	Paykunaqa ancha serio karqanku.
I wasn’t sure of anything.	Manam imamantapas segurochu karqani.
I was easy going.	Ñuqaqa facilmi karqani.
You’ve done it hard.	Qanmi sinchita ruwarqanki.
So many of them.	Chayna achka.
Now that’s unique.	Kunanqa chayqa sapallanmi.
Wherever he is at home.	Wasinpi maypipas kaptinpas.
I wasn’t that kind of person.	Manam chayna runachu karqani.
It’s seriously beautiful.	Serio sumaqmi.
He would have been arrested.	Payqa hap’isqa kanman karqan.
We can’t let that happen.	Manam chayna kananta saqiyta atichwanchu.
So, it’s that good.	Chaymi, chayna allin.
I really want to fix it.	Chiqaptam allichayta munani.
That’s it, he thinks.	Chayqa, nispas yuyaykun.
The reality is that.	Chiqap kaqmi chayna.
He excels at that.	Payqa chaypiqa aswan allintan ruwan.
This one refuses to work.	Kayqa llamk’ayta mana munanchu.
That can be difficult.	Chayqa sasam kanman.
They were foolish.	Paykunaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi karqaku.
Time was of the essence here.	Kaypiqa tiempon aswan importante karqan.
A man like you.	Qan hina runa.
You think something might be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman nispam yuyanki.
Now that’s pretty crazy.	Kunanqa chayqa allin loco.
Everything was really good though.	Tukuy imapas chiqap allinmi karqa ichaqa.
A little scared.	Huk chikan mancharisqa.
Not this anyway.	Mana kayqa imayna kaptinpas.
It could be worse.	Aswan mana allinchu kanman.
Everything is not there.	Tukuy imapas mana kanchu.
At least it seemed like it.	Aswanpas chayna hinam rikchakurqa.
Maybe someone will.	Ichapas pipas ruwanqa.
It is worth repeating that.	Chaytaqa yapamanta rimayqa allinmi.
After all, he has the best idea.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa aswan allin yuyayniyuqmi.
I think this is interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi nispam yuyani.
It sounds very strong.	Sinchi sinchitan uyarikun.
I listened to him today.	Kunan punchawmi payta uyarirqani.
She was a beautiful young woman.	Payqa sumaq rikchayniyuq sipasmi karqa.
But that’s crazy.	Ichaqa chayqa loco.
But it can be extremely inconvenient.	Ichaqa sinchitan mana allintachu ruwanman.
As much as possible.	Askha atisqanman hina.
There is so much newness here.	Kaypiqa ancha musuq kaymi kachkan.
Otherwise, there are two possibilities.	Mana chayqa iskay ruwaymi kanman.
There is no wealth here.	Kaypiqa manam qhapaq kay kanchu.
Most of the day, that's him.	Yaqa llapan punchawmi, chaymi pay.
Do your best in the present.	Kunan tiempopi tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
Fortunately, it was easier.	Ancha kusisqa kayqa aswan facilmi karqan.
But it was never really like that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu chhayna karqan.
Me, anyway.	Ñoqaqa, imayna kaptinpas.
That’s why I think.	Chayraykum piensani.
He always wanted to leave.	Payqa sapa kutim ripuyta munarqa.
Just tired of it.	Chaylla sayk’usqa.
We don’t have to do it every day.	Manam sapa punchawchu ruwananchik.

That has happened in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam pasarqa.
Now it was fine.	Kunanqa allinmi karqan.
I’m a pretty good one too.	Ñuqapas allin allin kaqmi kani.
That’s pretty good.	Chayqa allinmi allinmi.
Nice people, great food.	Sumaq runakuna, hatun mikhuy.
I haven’t found anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas tarinichu.
The less said, the better.	Aswan pisi nisqa kaptinqa, aswan allinmi kanqa.
That was a huge thing for me.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
That means you are one of the best.	Chayqa niyta munan qam huknin allin runa kasqaykita.
I hope it works soon.	Suyachkani chaylla llamk’ayta.
That would certainly be the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kanman.
Couldn't get the job done.	Mana llamkayta ruwayta atirqachu.
Do it first.	Ñawpaqtaqa ruway.
That’s going to be a pretty big deal.	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi kanqa.
You know who they are.	Yachankim pikuna kasqankuta.
In the fastest way possible.	Aswan utqaylla ruwaypi.
I think there were ten.	Chunka kasqankuta yuyani.
Nothing is that simple.	Mana imapas chayna facilchu.
And now here you are.	Hinaspa kunanqa kaypi kachkanki.
Maybe you do, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas ruwanki, ichapas mana.
Then, proceed to the next step.	Chaymanta, qatiqnin ruwayman riy.
He said he really was.	Payqa nirqam chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
But he doesn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan payqa ruwanchu.
There are two main ones.	Iskay hatunmi kan.
I can’t wait to go!.	¡Manan suyayta atiymanchu riyta!.
I didn’t want to be there.	Manam chaypiqa munarqanichu.
I’ll be there!.	¡Chaypi kasaq!.
But so far I can't find anything that works.	Ichaqa kunankamaqa manan tariyta atinichu imapas allin kaqta.
Probably something at school.	Yaqapaschá escuelapi imapas karqan.
Certainly better than where you are now.	Chiqamanta aswan allin maypichus kunan kachkanki chaymanta.
He felt uncomfortable about something.	Payqa imamantapas mana allintachu tarikurqa.
In fact, he may not have realized it.	Cheqaqtapunin manapaschá repararqanchu chay kasqanta.
Everything would be easier.	Tukuy imapas aswan facilmi kanman.
I don’t mean to say that.	Manam chayta niyta munanichu.
Who is no longer there.	Pitaq manaña kanchu.
So we have to do something.	Chaymi imatapas ruwananchik.
They were very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi karqaku.
I had a funny idea.	Huk asikunapaq yuyayniyuqmi karqani.
Yes that’s that.	Arí chay chayta.
He is a very bad guy.	Payqa ancha mana allin runam.
I know you are not a bad person.	Yachanim mana millay runa kasqaykita.
You want to go home.	Wasiman riyta munanki.
But no one seemed seriously hurt.	Ichaqa manan pipas sinchita k’irisqa hinachu karqan.
To do the right things.	Allin ruwaykunata ruwanapaq.
They want to get out of here.	Kaymanta lluqsiyta munanku.
It was long past midnight.	Kuska tutamanta unayñam karqa.
And again, again.	Hinaspa yapamanta.

Everything is today.	Tukuy imapas kunan punchawmi.

We disagree with that.	Chaywanqa manam acuerdopichu kayku.
They are not good now.	Kunanqa mana allinchu kanku.
No one needed it.	Manan pipas necesitarqanchu.
It seems to go better.	Aswan allinta puriq hina.
Someone was trapped, scared.	Pipas hapisqa kasqa, mancharisqa.
He never knew what he would do next.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu imatachus qhepaman ruwananta.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinchu.
It was nice to be alone.	Sapallan kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
And that’s what he said.	Hinaspa chaytan nirqan.
Wrong, it seemed.	Pantasqa, rikchakurqa.
Maybe he was a little crazy.	Ichapas huk chikan loco karqa.
There was nothing he could do to help her.	Manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu payta yanapananpaq.
That’s what he does really well.	Chaytan cheqaqtapuni allinta ruwan.
I'm really doing my best.	Chiqaptam tukuy atisqayta ruwachkani.
He wanted to ask her what was going to happen to her.	Payqa tapuyta munarqa imataq paywan pasananta.
Maybe it was just there.	Ichapas chaylla chaypi karqa.
Let’s wait a while.	Huk rato suyasun.
Maybe you have another thought on this?.	Ichapas huk yuyayniyuq kanki kaymanta?.
Today is a big day for me.	Kunan punchawqa hatun punchawmi ñuqapaq.
There were probably many.	Yaqapaschá askha karqan.
No, not anyone.	Manan, manan pipas.
That guy is kind of crazy.	Chay runaqa huk laya loco.
But no, you’re too tired.	Ichaqa manan, nishuta sayk’usqañan kashanki.
I can’t walk there, after all.	Manam chayman puriyta atiymanchu, tukuy imamanta.
So he’s doing this.	Chaymi kayta ruwachkan.
He would rather be alone than with me.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman sapallan kay ñoqawan kasqanmantaqa.
He didn’t know this would happen.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kay hina kananta.
You do this three times.	Chaytaqa kimsa kutitam ruwanki.
The process was not quick.	Chay ruwayqa manan usqhayllachu karqan.
You don’t think that at all.	Manam chaytaqa piensankichu ni imapipas.
I couldn't wait to see him.	Manam suyayta atirqanichu payta qawayta.
But then it happened.	Ichaqa chaymantam chayna karqa.
I don’t care either.	Ñuqapas manam imananpaschu.
That’s always surprising.	Chayqa sapa kutilla admirakuypaqmi.
And some bad.	Hinaspa wakin mana allin.
Don't forget to play.	Ama pukllayta qunqaychu.
This, however, would be wise.	Kayqa ichaqa yachaysapa kaymi kanman.
What, he wasn't quite sure.	Ima, manas allintachu seguro kasqa.
I think he is a wonderful man.	Payqa sumaq runa kasqanmantam piensani.
He was very lucky.	Payqa ancha suerteyoqmi kasqa.
Here I am, with you, everything happened.	Kaypi kachkani, qamwan, tukuy imapas pasarqa.
He seemed tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa hinam karqa.
And they were happy.	Hinaspa kusisqa karqanku.
I should have done that a long time ago.	Chaytaqa unayñam ruwanay karqa.
I can’t leave you hungry.	Manam yarqaymanta saqiyta atiymanchu.
It made the day go by faster.	Chaywanmi chay punchawqa aswan utqaylla pasarqa.
That’s not .	Chayqa manan .
The worse, the better.	Aswan mana allin kaptinqa, aswan allinmi.
Good, really good.	Allin, chiqap allin.
It was, one imagines.	Chayqa karqan, huk runaqa yuyaykun.
But I want to do that.	Ichaqa chayta ruwayta munani.
Clearly it wasn’t for him.	Sut’inmi karqan mana paypaq hinachu karqan.
He wasn't sure about that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa segurochu karqan.
It was probably the best.	Yaqapaschá aswan allinqa karqan.
That year passed.	Chay wata pasarqa.
But one day it will come.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi hamunqa.
I don’t want to tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta munanichu.
I don’t know what will happen to me.	Manan yachanichu imachus ñoqawan kananta.

Now, there isn’t.	Kunanqa, manam kanchu.
He couldn't remember where he was.	Manam yuyariyta atirqachu maypi kasqanmanta.
So it doesn’t always have to be.	Chaymi ichaqa mana sapa kutichu kanan.
He didn’t make a big deal out of it.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa hatun ruwaytaqa ruwarqanchu.
If it’s good, that’s it.	Allin kaptinqa, chaymi.
He probably thought of the word, but he didn’t.	Yaqapaschá chay simita yuyaykurqan, ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
There have never been such people.	Manam haykapipas chayna runakunaqa karqachu.
Maybe tell me.	Yaqapaschá willaway.
He is truly terrified.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa kashan.
And that was the big thing.	Hinaspa chaymi chay hatun kaq karqan.
Everyone knows how easy it is.	Lliwmi yachanku chay ruwayqa facil kasqanmanta.
That was last year.	Chayqa karqa qayna wata.
Yeah, no thanks.	Arí, mana gracias.
Why is this such a problem.	¿Imanasqataq kayqa chayna sasachakuy.
He was the worst.	Payqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
It was the only sensible thing to do.	Chayllam allin yuyayniyuq ruway karqa.

I’m less than impressed.	Aswan pisi admirakuypaqmi kani.

This was a low-key move.	Kayqa pisi yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqa.
I couldn’t figure him out.	Manam paytaqa yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
Great weeknight meal!.	¡Hatun semana tuta mikhuy!.

I felt like a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runa hinam tarikurqani.

Something is wrong there.	Chaypim imapas mana allinchu kachkan.

You are not that person.	Manam chay runachu kanki.
So far, he hasn't done that yet.	Kunankamaqa manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwanchu.

Maybe he just wanted to do it.	Ichapas chaylla ruwayta munarqa.
Being in the forefront.	Ñawpaqpi kay.

And then, one night .	Hinaspa chaymanta, huk tuta .

Tell someone.	Pimanpas willay.
Something strange there.	Chaypi imapas mana riqsisqa kaq.
He wouldn’t do that.	Manam chaynataqa ruwanmanchu.

I’m worried about that.	Chaymanta llakisqa kachkani.
I was good to go.	Allinmi karqani rinaypaq.
But that may not be true.	Ichaqa chayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.

Other than that, it makes no sense.	Huk chaymantaqa, manañam imapaqpas valenchu.

In fact it’s actually quite simple.	Chiqaptaqa chiqaptaqa ancha facilmi.

Every day doesn't seem easy.	Sapa punchawqa manam facilchu hinachu kachkan.
I just can’t figure out why.	Chaylla mana yachayta atinichu imarayku chayta.
Yes, there is a gap there.	Arí, chaypiqa huk chikan kachkan.
But in other words, he’s no good.	Ichaqa huk nisqanman hinaqa, payqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I wish you were here at that time.	Munaymanmi chay tiempopi kaypi kasqaykita.
It was almost a good thing.	Yaqa allinmi karqa.
That it’s actually not good enough.	Chiqaptaqa mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
That shouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanan.
He, however, could not take it.	Paymi ichaqa mana chayta hap’iyta atirqanchu.
He will certainly be.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kanqa.
You don’t know what it is yet.	Manaraqmi yachankichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
That was more amazing than anything.	Chayqa imamantapas aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
Some people want more, more, more.	Wakin runakunaqa munanku aswan, aswan, aswan.
He refused to listen to it.	Chayta mana uyariyta munarqanchu.
He told me he had to go.	Paymi niwarqa rinan kasqanmanta.
Nobody cares here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas imananpaschu.
And tomorrow is another year.	Hinaspa paqarin huk wata.
There’s just nothing left.	Chaylla manaña imapas kanchu.
Something wrong, very wrong.	Imapas mana allin, ancha mana allin.
He is probably very happy.	Payqa yaqapaschá ancha kusisqa kashan.
It was surprisingly cold.	Admirakuypaqmi chiri karqa.
It wasn’t easy at all.	Manam facilchu karqa ni imapipas.
Almost anyone would do that.	Yaqa llapan pipas chayta ruwanman.
Pretend you’re not with us.	Mana ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita hina ruway.
They were all together, one by one.	Llapallankum kuska karqaku, hukmanta hukmanta.
It doesn’t matter, you don’t want that.	Manam imananpaschu, manam chaytaqa munankichu.
I thought it was all out there.	Tukuy hawapi kasqanmantam yuyaykurqani.
The worst came later.	Aswan mana allinqa qhepamanmi hamurqan.
So it’s very easy.	Chaymi ancha facil.
I don’t like being famous.	Manam gustanchu riqsisqa kay.
But there is a fact.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi kan.
It is double greatness.	Iskay kuti hatun kaymi.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chay hina ruway.
However, we are not quite there yet.	Ichaqa, manaraqmi allintachu chaypi kachkaniku.
That was really bad.	Chiqamanta chay mana allin karqa.
I don’t want to say it anymore.	Manañam niyta munanichu.
So this came from there.	Chaymi kayqa chaymanta hamurqa.
He probably knew where he was now.	Yaqapaschá kunan maypi kashasqanmanta yacharqan.
I can't fix that.	Chaytaqa manam allichayta atiymanchu.
He doesn’t want to stay here.	Payqa manan kaypi qhepakuyta munanchu.
Find out if he is .	Yachay sichus payqa .
You are a good person, after all.	Allin runam kanki, tukuy imamanta.
In fact, it really was.	Aswanpas cheqaqtapunin karqan.
I know no one else can.	Yachanim mana pipas atisqanmanta.
So everything was very easy.	Chaymi tukuy imapas ancha facil karqa.
Again, this is easy.	Yapamanta, kayqa facilmi.
I’m very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa kani.
That ? 	Chay ?
Proud time.	Orgulloso tiempo.
Yes, she is beautiful.	Arí, payqa sumaqmi.
Please tell me what it is.	Ama hina kaspa willaway ima kasqanmanta.
He didn’t know it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chhayna kasqanta.
That was obviously wrong.	Chay ruwayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
And, he did it.	Hinaspa, ruwarqa.
And my own me.	Hinaspa ñuqapa ñuqa.
That lasted about two weeks.	Chayqa yaqa iskay semana hinam karqa.
I couldn’t bear to hear it.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu uyariyta.
It will be quick.	Utqaylla kanqa.
He still does that today.	Kunankamapas chaytan ruwan.
I’m sure he’s a good guy.	Seguro kani allin wayna kasqanmanta.
Disagree with me, okay.	Mana ñuqawan acuerdopichu, allinmi.
Yours could be next!.	¡Qanpa kaqmi qatiqnin kanman!.
All the time, maybe.	Tukuy tiempo, ichapas.
It was just difficult.	Chayllaraqmi sasa karqa.
Tomorrow is the future.	Paqarin hamuq pacha.
He did what he could.	Payqa atisqanman hinan ruwarqan.
Some knowledge, anyway.	Wakin yachay, imayna kaptinpas.
The man wanted to talk.	Chay runaqa rimayta munarqa.
But he couldn’t find a job.	Ichaqa manan llank’anata tariyta atirqanchu.
Yes, it is good.	Arí allinmi.
It would be pretty big.	Allin hatunmi kanman.
How do you do this?.	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwawaq?.
The man went with us.	Chay runam ñuqaykuwan rirqa.
So it will be next year.	Chaymi hamuq wata kanqa.
So, here is the problem.	Chaymi, kaypi sasachakuy kachkan.
The really great one.	Chiqap hatun kaq.
I really had no idea.	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani.
He’s great, but he’s very .	Payqa ancha allinmi, ichaqa ancha .
If only things were that simple.	Sichus imapas chayna facil kanman chayqa.
I’m not good enough for you.	Manam qampaq allinchu kani.
It must be hungry.	Yarqaymanta kanan.
And he wanted to.	Hinaspa munarqa.
The other option is to do nothing.	Huknin ruwayqa mana imatapas ruwaymi.
That’s nothing really.	Chayqa manan imapas cheqaqtachu.
I can't imagine that.	Chaytaqa manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu.
And how about that’s good.	Hinaspa imaynataq chay allin kasqanmanta.
This is the name.	Kayqa sutin.
One of them will do.'	Hukninmi ruwanqa’, nispas nin.
I’m older, much older.	Ñuqaqa kuraq kani, ancha kuraq kani.
I don’t really know which one you prefer.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani mayqin munasqaykita.
Either you do well or you learn something.	Icha allinta ruwanki utaq imatapas yachanki.
If so, this is it.	Chayna kaptinqa kaymi.
Maybe they’re better off without me.	Ichapas mana ñuqawanqa aswan allin kachkanku.
I wish it was better.	Aswan allin kananta munayman.
Don’t miss this great event.	Ama kay hatun ruwaytaqa qunqaychu.
Every day was great.	Sapa punchawmi ancha allin karqa.
I don’t know any other language.	Manam huk rimayta yachanichu.
I am well aware of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam yachani.
But we need to do better in this area.	Ichaqa chaypiqa aswan allintam ruwananchik.
But he said that it was.	Ichaqa chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
If so, that’s a good thing.	Chayna kaptinqa, chayqa allinmi.
That was him, the same man.	Chayqa paymi kasqa, kikin runa.
And so, everything seemed fine.	Hinaspa chayna, tukuy imapas allin hinam karqa.
He looked happy about it.	Payqa kusisqa qhawarisqa chaymanta.
Perhaps no one knows.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu.
That wouldn’t have been difficult.	Chayqa manan sasachu kanman karqan.
No, it’s never that simple.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
And if that’s the case .	Hinaspa chayna kaptinqa .
Beautiful, hurt, and angry.	Sumaq, k’irisqa, phiñasqa ima.
I want to be yours.	Ñuqaqa qampaq kaytam munani.
But everything was as it should be.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam karqa.
Everything would be fine saying.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman nispa nispa.
This is way beyond that.	Kayqa chaymantaqa aswan hatunmi.
He wasn’t sure at all.	Payqa manan imapipas segurochu kasqa.
It happened twice.	Iskay kutitam pasarqa.
He is always there for you.	Payqa sapa kutim qampaq kachkan.
You don’t know how to fix things.	Manan yachankichu imatapas imayna allichayta.
It had been a very long time now.	Kunanqa ancha unayñan kasqa.
It was a very big deal.	Ancha hatun ruwaymi karqa.
But of course it does.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chaytaqa ruwan.
So that’s what it’s going to be.	Chaymi chayna kanqa.
This should be your goal.	Kaymi qampa munasqayki kanan.
He is the least talkative person ever.	Payqa aswan pisi rimaq runam haykapipas.
This means that if you are a nice person.	Kayqa niyta munan, sichus sumaq runa kanki chayqa.
It looks like somewhere.	Maypipas rikchakun.
But it’s not that simple anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chay hina facilchu.
I'm not sure what happened.	Manam segurochu kani ima pasasqanmanta.
Everyone wants to know that.	Chaytaqa llapallankum yachayta munanku.
It wasn't right or wrong, that's all.	Manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu karqa, chayllam karqa.
One day, one day .	Huk punchaw, huk punchaw .
In fact, it is easier.	Aswanpas aswan facilmi.
Two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
That didn't make things any better.	Chaywanmi manaña imapas allinchu karqa.
No big deal, he thinks.	Mana hatun ruwaychu, nispas yuyaykun.
I’m not that unreasonable.	Manam chayna mana yuyayniyuqchu kani.
So tell me about him.	Chaymi paymanta willaway.
But that wasn’t the only reason he stayed.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu imarayku qhepakurqan.
A strange man.	Huk mana riqsisqa runa.
But no, he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan atirqanchu.
No, that's not a good thing.	Manan chayqa manan allinchu.
But really, it's not that hard.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam chayna sasachu.
I was kinda stupid.	Ñuqaqa huk laya sonso hinam karqani.
Please do that as soon as possible.	Ama hina kaspa, chayta usqhaylla ruway.
But of course it does.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwan.
Two people.	Iskay runakuna.
So much went wrong.	Chaymi achka mana allinchu karqa.
Really angry actually.	Chiqamanta phiñasqa chiqamanta.
No one here is a villain.	Kaypiqa manam pipas millay runachu.
Find out what happened and why.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta, imanasqa kasqanmanta yachay.
You were a good thinker.	Allin yuyayniyuqmi karqanki.
I have no idea if this is good or not.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani sichus kay allin kanman icha manachu chayta.
That’s something, at least .	Chayqa imapas, aswanpas .
That’s why it’s so difficult.	Chayraykum ancha sasa.
I feel so insecure.	Ancha mana segurochu sientekuni.
There is so much beauty in being black.	Yana kaypiqa ancha sumaq kaymi.
And there it happened.	Hinaspa chaypiqa chayna pasarqa.
But they probably know that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachanku.
That’s two years.	Chayqa iskay wata.
I really have to do that all the time.	Chiqamanta chayta sapa kuti ruwanay tiyan.
That terrible food.	Chay manchay mikhuy.
Tell me what you’re going to do.	Willaway imata ruwanaykipaq.
I didn’t do very well.	Manam anchatachu allinta ruwarqani.
Those are the people you can’t defeat.	Chay runakunaqa manam atipayta atiwaqchu.
It wasn't supposed to be this hard.	Manam kayna sasachu kanan karqa.
So they’re really, really new.	Chaymi paykunaqa chiqap, chiqap musuq kanku.
In fact, he had a problem.	Chiqaptaqa, huk sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
But it sure seems easier.	Ichaqa seguro aswan facilmi rikchakun.
The thinker did a great job of working in the past.	Yuyayniyuq runaqa ñawpaqpi llamk’ayta hatun llamk’ayta ruwarqan.
He took it hard.	Payqa sinchitan chayta hap’irqan.
I should have done this the other day.	Ñawpaq p'unchawmi kayta ruwanay karqan.
I didn’t know this would happen.	Manam yacharqanichu kay pasananta.
I don’t think he can do that.	Mana chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta yuyani.
I can't work now.	Kunanqa manam llamkayta atiymanchu.
I never really thought much about it.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa chaypiqa anchatachu piensarqani.
It would be foolish to do so.	Chayta ruwayqa mana yuyayniyuq kaymi kanman.
Then, maybe, something else.	Chaymanta, ichapas, huk imapas.
But there is another way to do it.	Ichaqa huk ruwaymi kan.
I’m not sure about this yet.	Manaraqmi kaymanta segurochu kani.
Very very much.	Ancha ancha.
Here, do this.	Kaypi, kayta ruway.
He left it well.	Allintam saqirqa.
Maybe too big.	Ichapas ancha hatun.
They never were, maybe.	Paykunaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqanku, ichapas.
But it was like always.	Ichaqa sapa kuti hinan karqan.
It’s all good for him.	Tukuy allinmi paypaq.
I am very happy right now.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kunanpacha.
I think this is wrong.	Kayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
And why is that bad.	Hinaspa imaraykutaq chay mana allin.
It is better than everything and nothing.	Tukuy imamanta, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
You were a good teacher.	Allin yachachiqmi karqanki.
I think people matter.	Yuyaykuni runakunaqa importante kasqankuta.
I want to live here.	Kaypi tiyayta munani.
This man was something else.	Kay runaqa huk imapas kasqa.
And maybe this is it.	Hinaspa ichapas kay kanman.
But things weren't quite right here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manam imapas allintachu karqa.
No, everything is fine.	Manan, tukuy imapas allinmi.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa allintam chaymantaqa seguro karqa.
Don’t you think so?.	¿Manachu yuyanki?.
Now that's the best thing.	Kunanqa chaymi aswan allinqa.
Looks like it will continue.	Hinallam kanqa hinam rikchakun.
This teacher was very happy.	Kay yachachiqmi ancha kusisqa karqan.
But of course you know all about it.	Ichaqa sut’inmi tukuy chaymanta yachanki.
It’s a very, very difficult task.	Ancha, ancha sasa ruwaymi.
He wanted to do that.	Chayta ruwayta munarqa.
He told me he thought they were ugly.	Paymi niwarqa millay kasqankuta piensasqanmanta.
So there was one.	Chaymi huk kaq karqa.
This is not too difficult for you to do.	Chaytaqa manam ancha sasachu ruwanaykipaqqa.
He obviously knew too much.	Payqa sut’inmi nishuta yacharqan.
Surprising but true.	Admirakuypaqmi ichaqa chiqap.
Again, the less the better.	Yapamanta, aswan pisi kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
It just doesn’t get any better than that.	Chaylla mana chaymanta aswan allintachu tarikun.
It does everything it’s supposed to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanan kaqta ruwan.
But he really didn’t say much of anything.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana anchatachu imatapas rimarqan.
And that speaks to his desire to buy.	Hinaspa chaymi riman rantiyta munasqanmanta.
Not sure why though.	Ichaqa manan segurochu imarayku chayta.
I'm not here, actually.	Manam kaypichu kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I mean, it’s there.	Niyta munani, chaypi kachkan.
That’s right, you guys.	Chayqa allinmi, qamqa.
That’s obvious to him now.	Chayqa kunanqa sut’inmi paypaq.
Yes that’s good.	Arí chay allin.
I think he was worried about me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta llakisqa kasqanmanta.
There was never a chance for evil to triumph over good.	Manam haykapipas karqachu millay allin kaqta atipananpaq chansa.
Too many, in fact.	Ancha achka, chiqaptaqa.
Yes, he certainly is.	Arí, payqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina kashan.
He has been there since ten.	Payqa chunka ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi kachkan.
I’m sure I did the right thing.	Seguro kani allin ruwasqaymanta.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manam kanchu.
No matter where it is here.	Maypi kaypi kaptinpas.
Yes, he seemed to be in good standing.	Arí, payqa allin qhawarisqa hinan karqan.
Of course, it can’t be all bad.	Chiqamanta, mana tukuy mana allinchu kanman.
So better late then never.	Chaymi aswan allin tarde chaymanta mana hayk’aqpas.
This obviously doesn’t seem right.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu rikch’akun.
He told me you are here.	Paymi niwarqa kaypi kanki nispa.
He knows what this is like.	Payqa yachanmi kay imayna kasqanmanta.
He does most days, but not today.	Payqa yaqa llapan punchawmi ruwan, kunan punchawmi ichaqa mana.
Unfortunately, we failed.	Llakikuypaqmi, mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
This should be more obvious in the hospital setting.	Chayqa aswan sut’inmi kanan hospitalpi.
I want to do it this time.	Kay kutipi ruwayta munani.
He wanted to be sure of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta seguro kayta munarqan.
That’s where he excelled.	Chaypin payqa aswan allinta ruwarqan.
Thanks again for everything.	Hukmanta gracias tukuy imamanta.
That’s why it was so great.	Chayraykum ancha hatun karqa.
If it is not a serious problem.	Mana ancha sasachakuy kaptinqa.
Probably so well.	Yaqapaschá chayna allinta.
No one wants it now.	Kunanqa manam pipas munanchu.
He was rather impressive tonight.	Payqa kunan tutaqa aswan admirakuypaqmi karqa.
It’s really nice!.	¡Chiqamanta sumaqmi!.
Never more, once less.	Mana hayk’aqpas aswan, huk kuti pisi.
Being rich is a good thing.	Qhapaq kayqa allinmi.
Everything in the household and everything else you need is a good idea to keep yourself safe and secure. 	Wasipi tukuy imakuna, tukuy imakuna ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima, tukuy ima,

A good man does that.	Allin runam chayta ruwan.
He asked me where he was.	Paymi tapuwarqa maypi kasqanmanta.
I don’t understand why not.	Manam entiendenichu imanasqa mana.
And maybe you're a little scared.	Hinaspa ichapas huk chikan mancharisqa kachkanki.
Therefore it may be true.	Chayraykum chiqap kanman.
It goes very fast.	Ancha utqaylla rin.
And I’m the one.	Hinaspa ñuqaqa kani.
Not a big deal out here.	Mana hatun ruwaychu kay hawapi.
To ride with him.	Paywan kuska carropi rinanpaq.
Yes, despite everything.	Arí, tukuy ima kaptinpas.
But it's bad, it sounds ridiculous.	Ichaqa mana allinmi, asikunapaq hinam uyarikun.
Then the big one.	Chaymanta hatun kaq.
Three times faster.	Kimsa kuti aswan utqaylla.
But he didn't do that after all.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwarqanchu tukuy imamanta.
He said nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manan imatapas nirqanchu.
No, you can’t do that.	Manan, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That is, people like you, people like me.	Chayqa, qam hina runakuna, ñuqa hina runakuna.
But it wasn’t what he wanted to do.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munasqanman hinachu karqan.
And for the sake of that thing.	Hinaspa chay imapas allin kananpaq.
You have no idea about anything.	Manam imamantapas yuyayniyuqchu kanki.
They are very childlike.	Paykunaqa ancha wawa hinam kanku.
Something that is sometimes uncomfortable.	Imapas wakin kuti mana allin kaq.
If so, it may not be a good idea.	Chayna kaptinqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
And now here they were.	Hinaspa kunan kaypi karqanku.
After that, it was constant.	Chay qhepamanmi sapa kutilla karqan.
It's all very clear now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas ancha sut'inmi.
I’m sure you’ve been very busy this week.	Seguro kani kay semanapi ancha ocupasqa kasqaykita.
He's obviously there.	Payqa sut'inmi kashan.
It was a hard night.	Sinchi tutan karqan.
Instead, do the right things.	Aswanpas allin ruwaykunata ruway.
I ask myself that question all the time.	Sapa kutim chayta tapukuni.
But it was a milestone.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa huk hatun ruwaymi karqan.
Too much of anything can go wrong.	Llumpay imapas mana allinchu kanman.
That’s why we did it right.	Chayraykum allinta ruwarqayku.
If you are smart.	Sichus yachaysapa kanki.
Happy for me at that time.	Kusisqa ñuqapaq chay pacha.
And then there is nothing.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa manam imapas kanchu.
In fact, it was a better time.	Aswanpas aswan allin tiempon karqan.
Therein lies the problem, however.	Chaypin ichaqa chay sasachakuy kashan.
But things aren't quite right yet.	Ichaqa imapas manaraqmi allinchu kachkan.
It seemed ridiculous.	Chaytaqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
Today he speaks.	Kunan pacha pay riman.
It was going to be an amazing day.	Chay punchawqa admirakuypaqmi kanan karqa.
It wasn’t enough, of course.	Manan chayllachu karqan, sut’inmi.
I made them better.	Chaykunataqa aswan allintam ruwarqani.
He’s hungry and tired.	Payqa yarqasqa, sayk’usqa ima kachkan.
It may not be the only thing.	Manapaschá chayllachu kanqa.
Again, it happened.	Yapamanta, chayna pasarqa.
That's today, actually.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
He doesn’t have time.	Payqa manan tiempon kanchu.
It’s interesting to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayqa sumaqmi.
That wasn’t like him at all.	Chayqa manan pay hinachu karqan ni imapipas.
Yes, it can be that simple.	Arí, chayna facilmi kanman.
Otherwise, I’ll be the first.	Mana chayqa, ñoqa ñawpaq kaq kasaq.
I really hope not.	Chiqamanta suyachkani mana.
No one knows how long the process could take.	Manan pipas yachanchu hayk’a tiempo chay ruwayqa kanman chayta.
Otherwise it might not be much.	Mana chayqa manapaschá anchatachu kanman.
I am as impressed as he is.	Ñuqapas pay hinam admirasqa kachkani.
He was nowhere to be found.	Payqa manan maypipas karqanchu.
It should be easier than this.	Kaymantaqa aswan facilmi kanan.
Yes, it’s his real name.	Arí, chiqap sutinmi.
Maybe you’re scared.	Ichapas mancharisqa kachkanki.
So it’s good for you.	Chaymi allin qampaq.
There weren’t many.	Achka manam karqachu.
Certainly for you, .	Chiqamanta qampaq, .
I was the second one.	Ñoqaqa iskay kaqmi karqani.
And, yes, he was.	Hinaspa, arí, payqa karqan.
Hopefully everything will work out right away.	Munaymanmi chay rato tukuy ima allin kananpaq.
I decide to ask him.	Payta tapuyta yuyaykuni.
And do it better this time.	Hinaspa kay kutipi aswan allinta ruway.
I think every moment.	Yuyaykuni sapa rato.
I don’t know why this would be.	Mana yachanichu imarayku kay kanman.
He did the work, after all.	Paymi llamkayta ruwaq, tukuy imamanta.
Three years, at least.	Kimsa wata, aswanpas.
He had no reason to be there.	Payqa manan imaraykupas chaypiqa karqanchu.
He felt hungry.	Payqa yarqasqa hinam tarikurqa.
They are a human being.	Paykunaqa huk runam.
The first man spoke to him.	Ñawpaq kaq runan paywan rimarqan.
Where do you know that from.	Maymantataq chayta yachanki.
Maybe this whole time was for him.	Ichapas kay tukuy tiempo paypaq karqa.
He said tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam nisqa.
I really didn’t feel like talking.	Chiqaptaqa manam rimanaypaq hinachu karqani.
Now it’s amazing.	Kunanqa admirakuypaqmi.
It’s all right!.	¡Tukuy allinmi!.
But it’s a lot more interesting than that.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa aswan sumaqmi.
This was a great day.	Kayqa hatun punchawmi karqa.
If anyone can help.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa.
Maybe more depressed.	Ichapas aswan llakisqa.
Still, he does things right.	Chayna kaptinpas imatapas allintam ruwan.
It was the people.	Chayqa karqa runakunam.
I mean that in a better way.	Chaytaqa aswan allinta niyta munani.
One day he was gone.	Huk punchawmi manaña karqachu.
Yeah, that’s what they are.	Arí, chaymi paykunaqa kanku.
I’m not very good with it.	Manam ancha allinchu kani chaywanqa.
So it doesn't really mean anything.	Chaymi mana chiqaptachu ima niyta munan.
It sounds very bad.	Ancha mana allinmi uyarikun.
I just pretended not to.	Mana chayta ruwanaypaq hinallam ruwarqani.
He was not the same person.	Payqa manam kikin runa hinachu karqa.
It's ridiculously fast.	Asikunapaq hina utqayllam.
It’s obviously very successful.	Sut’inmi ancha allinta ruwasqanmanta.
That, that’s all.	Chay, chaylla.
We need to do the right things here.	Kaypiqa allin ruwaykunata ruwananchik tiyan.
Just in time!.	¡Tiempollanpi!.
But this one pretty much did it.	Ichaqa kayqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
Still not the worst.	Hinallam mana aswan mana allinchu.
At least yesterday afternoon.	Aswanpas qayna tarde.
Almost a new type of person.	Yaqa musuq laya runa.
He wouldn’t be alone anymore.	Manañan sapallanchu kanman karqan.
I felt like a scholar.	Yachaysapa hinam tarikurqani.
That was the first step.	Chayqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi karqan.
However, it is very difficult to successfully implement such an adjustment.	Ichaqa ancha sasam chayna allichayta allinta ruwayqa.
I hope he comes back next year.	Hamuq wata kutimunanta suyachkani.
He doesn’t seem upset at all.	Payqa manan imapipas phiñasqa hinachu kashan.
But this doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan kayqa imananpaschu.
I don’t really want to do that.	Manam anchatachu chayta ruwayta munani.
It's very similar here.	Kaypiqa anchatam rikchakun.
I always think I need to do better and do better.	Sapa kutim piensani aswan allinta ruwanay hinaspa aswan allinta ruwanay kasqanmanta.
There is something human there.	Chaypiqa imapas runam kachkan.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kachkanku.
But there they are, man.	Ichaqa chaypim kachkanku, runa.
He said he’d never talk about it again.	Nisqa manaña hayk’aqpas chaymanta rimananpaq.
Maybe that’s smart.	Ichapas chayqa yachaysapa kanman.
He doesn’t want to, he said.	Manam munanchu, nispa.
I’m wondering, too.	Ñuqapas tapukuni.
The people were terrified.	Chay runakunaqa mancharisqa karqanku.
He didn’t know you could do that.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
This looked interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Certainly it could be worse.	Chiqamanta aswan millay kanman.
Did you know that.	Yacharqankichu.
I can’t really say why.	Manam allintachu niyta atiyman imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
He was a man who played the game.	Payqa chay pukllayta pukllaq runam karqa.
No, that came later.	Manan, chayqa qhepamanmi hamurqan.
Anywhere in the world.	Maypipas kay pachapi.
They were really wrong.	Chiqamanta pantasqa karqanku.
Both were heavily intoxicated.	Iskayninkum llumpayta machasqa karqaku.
I’m not really into it.	Manam chiqaptaqa chayman hinachu kachkani.
There seems to be no one there.	Chaypiqa mana pipas kanman hinam.
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Manam pimanpas imananpaschu.
But it was no longer funny.	Ichaqa manañan asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
He did not yet know how that would be.	Imayna chay kanman chaytaqa manaraqmi yacharqanchu.
He does not want you to be sad and depressed.	Payqa manam munanchu llakisqa hinaspa llakisqa kanaykita.
He looked so foolish.	Payqa ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi rikchakurqa.
He was better than this.	Payqa kaymanta aswan allinmi karqa.
I'm pretty sure you are too.	Ñuqaqa allintam seguro kani qampas chayna kasqanmanta.
But it didn’t work out for me.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan ñoqawanqa.
But it didn’t work out.	Ichaqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
it will be immediate.	chaymi chaylla kanqa.
He was pretty sure he knew.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan yachasqanmanta.
He did time in prison.	Payqa carcelpi tiempota ruwarqan.
That didn’t mean it.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
But I think you’re right.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
I do everything in excess.	Tukuy imatam ruwani llumpayta.
He did it all that night.	Tukuy chay tutam ruwarqa.
But I don’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munanichu.
But he looked hard.	Ichaqa sinchitan qhawarirqan.
It was the next big thing.	Chayqa qatiqnin hatun kaqmi karqa.
So, it’s that bad.	Chaymi, chayna millay.
Too many people are not good.	Ancha achka runakuna mana allinchu.
I do that, a lot.	Chaytaqa ruwani, achkata.
They all want something from him.	Llapallankum paymanta imatapas munanku.
But I disagree with that.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa acuerdopichu kani.
No one knows exactly what happened.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan imakuna pasasqanmantaqa.
So far this has been the case first.	Kunankamaqa kaymi ñawpaqtaqa karqa.
It was the last day.	Qhepa p’unchaymi karqan.
No, neither do I.	Manan, ñoqapas nitaq.
That was probably true.	Chayqa yaqapaschá cheqaq karqan.
He was very easy going.	Payqa ancha facilmi karqa.
Faster this time around.	Aswan utqaylla kay kutipi.
This guy was a very good guy.	Kay runaqa llumpay allin kasqa.
And that's really the point here.	Hinaspa chaymi chiqaptapuni kaypi rimachkan.
Then you’re going to.	Chaymantaqa qamqa.
One of them will do it.	Hukninmi ruwanqa.
You should do this regularly.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanayki.
Go there now.	Kunan chayman riy.
It wasn’t as good as it used to be.	Manam ñawpaq hinachu allin karqa.
This, however, has two problems.	Kaymi ichaqa iskay sasachakuypi tarikun.
I'm fine with that, really.	Allinmi kani chaywan, chiqaptapuni.
That just happened.	Chayqa chayllam pasarqa.
You still can't eat.	Kunankamapas manam mikuyta atiwaqchu.
Often again people.	Sapa kuti yapamanta runakuna.
I just have to do it.	Chayllaraqmi ruwanay kachkan.
They are very secure.	Paykunaqa ancha segurom kanku.
This process is still inadequate.	Kay ruwayqa kunankamapas mana allinchu kachkan.
No one took it seriously.	Manan pipas chaytaqa allintachu qhawarirqan.
Otherwise, he would be alone.	Mana chayqa, sapallanmi kanman.
But that was all it was ever going to be.	Ichaqa chayllam haykapipas kanan karqa.
That may not be the same person.	Chayqa manapaschá kaq runachu kanman.
It was all there.	Tukuy chaypi kasqa.
He couldn't remember ever being so angry.	Payqa manan yuyariyta atirqanchu hayk’aqpas chay hina phiñasqa kasqanmanta.
This will take a lot of time.	Chaypaqqa askha tiempon kanqa.
This beautiful girl is very, very talented.	Kay sumaq sipasmi ancha, ancha yachaysapa.
Only you know why.	Qamllam yachanki imanasqa kasqanmanta.
What a good child.	Ima allin wawa.
But there was no more.	Ichaqa manañan aswanpas karqanchu.
It’s not easy at all.	Manan imapipas facilchu.
I know it will happen.	Ñoqaqa yachani chayna kananta.
Known for being unknown.	Mana riqsisqa kasqanmanta riqsisqa.
Obviously, there is.	Sut’inmi, kanmi.
She had never been anywhere so happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas maypipas chhayna kusisqachu karqan.
If you really do, this should do it.	Sichus cheqaqtapuni ruwanki chayqa, kaymi ruwanan.
Again, that would take time.	Yapamanta, chaypaqqa tiempon kanman.
Nothing seemed right.	Manam imapas allin hinachu rikchakurqa.
Tomorrow, he might do something.	Paqarin, imatapas ruwanman.
It was surprisingly bad.	Admirakuypaqmi mana allin karqa.
Eat it right away.	Chaylla mikhuy.
He was never unreasonable.	Manam haykapipas mana yuyayniyuqchu karqa.
But there was nothing all weekend.	Ichaqa manan imapas karqanchu tukuy semana tukuyta.
It’s nice that sometimes it’s the hardest thing to do.	Sumaqmi wakin kutipi aswan sasa ruwayqa.
But it doesn’t seem real.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqchu rikch’akun chayqa.
He’s cold, that one.	Payqa chiri, chay huknin.
He always had the best idea.	Payqa sapa kutim aswan allin yuyayniyuq karqa.
What a good guy.	Ima allin runa.
I know that is wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam yachani.
You said you could wait.	Suyayta atisqaykita nirqanki.
I certainly did.	Ñoqaqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
Repeat for a set time.	Huk churasqa tiempota yapamanta ruway.
Yes, it is very large.	Arí, ancha hatunmi.
Yes, you are right.	Arí, allintam chaytaqa ruwanki.
Yes, you are here.	Arí, kaypim kachkanki.
No, you’re the one.	Manan, qanmi kanki.
But here everything didn’t make sense.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan tukuy imapas imapaqpas hinachu karqan.
That's all that matters, that one day.	Chayllam imapas, chay huk punchaw.
But he knew his name.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi sutinta.
It just wouldn’t be right, not wrong at all.	Chaylla mana allinchu kanman, mana mana allinchu ni imapipas.
of course.	riki.
The weather is very nice.	Tiempo ancha sumaq.
I’ve always been bad.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi mana allin karqani.
He is doing a lot of things.	Payqa achkatam ruwachkan.
You never want to understand them.	Manam haykapipas chaykunataqa entiendeyta munankichu.
Not happy about it.	Mana chaymanta kusisqachu.
He will not rush anything.	Manan imatapas usqhayllachu ruwanqa.
And this was the case.	Hinaspa kayqa chayna karqa.
A week later they were acquitted.	Huk semana qhepamanmi mana huchayoq karqanku.
But one day you will succeed.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi allinta ruwanki.
He knows he will help her.	Payqa yachanmi yanapananta.
It started to take a toll.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwayta qallaykurqa.
He doesn’t want to take it.	Payqa manan munanchu chayta hap’iyta.
Success is not certain.	Allin ruwayqa manan segurochu.
He couldn’t do that before.	Payqa manan ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
It wasn’t really hard.	Manam chiqap sasachu karqa.
He enjoys doing so.	Chayta ruwaspan kusisqa tarikun.
I could do this night after night.	Kaytaqa tutamanta tutan ruwayta atiyman karqan.
He was really bad.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin karqan.
A few years later, we did.	Iskay kinsa wata qhepamanmi chayta ruwarqayku.
He’s the least scared, the least worried.	Paymi aswan pisi mancharisqa, aswan pisi llakisqa.
He died a short time later in a hospital.	Pisi tiempo qhepamanmi huk hospitalpi wañupurqan.
Something he seemed to have a good sense of.	Imapas payqa allin yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
He didn’t have to hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu ruwanan karqan.
But you’re beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanki.
And he received it well.	Hinan payqa allinta chaskirqan.
Without a sense of humor.	Mana yuyayniyuq.
He wants to be that person.	Payqa chay runa kaytam munan.
I can't see it from here.	Kaymantaqa manam rikuyta atinichu.
But it does very well.	Ichaqa ancha allintam ruwan.
I'm going to have the party tonight.	Kunan tutam chay fiestata ruwasaq.
It was a very big deal for me there.	Chaypiqa ancha hatunmi karqa ñuqapaq.
I'm sorry I did such a poor job.	Llakikuni chayna mana allin llamkayta ruwasqaymanta.
He knows what you are.	Payqa yachanmi ima kasqaykita.
Not bad, not good.	Mana mana allinchu, mana allinchu.
So disgusting about me.	Chaymi millay ñuqamanta.
Evil cannot be good.	Mana allinqa manam allinchu kanman.
People didn’t seem all that concerned.	Runakunaqa manan chay hina llakisqa hinachu karqanku.
I'm always so lonely.	Sapa kutim chayna sapallay kani.
I am currently in the process of doing so.	Kunanqa chaymanta ruwaypi kachkani.
I actually thought this was true.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani.
She didn’t stay married for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu casarasqa qhepakurqan.
You can’t even do this.	Manan kayta ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
They are like most people there.	Chaypiqa yaqa llapa runakuna hinam kanku.
You want to buy more.	Astawan rantiyta munanki.
Please let me know immediately.	Ama hina kaspa, chaylla willaway.
If it is the future.	Hamuq pacha kaptinqa.
I don't want him here tonight.	Manam kunan tuta kaypi kananta munanichu.
I don’t think of it any other way.	Manam huk hinachu piensani.
It should be really easy to do that.	Chiqamanta mana sasachu kanan tiyan chayta ruwayta.
Greatness is, or should be, something hidden.	Hatun kayqa imapas pakasqa hinam, utaq kanan.
She thought he was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kashasqanmantan yuyaykurqan.
He knows what you need to do.	Payqa yachanmi imatapas ruwanaykita.
No one could do this right.	Manan pipas kayta allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
No one wants those things.	Chaykunataqa manam pipas munanchu.
He didn’t have to do it.	Manan ruwananchu karqan.
That’s how he taught.	Chaynatam yachachiq.
A few months ago.	Iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
Do, please, anything.	Ruway, ama, imatapas.
No, two and a half.	Manan, iskay kuskan.
It will usually do much more than that.	Yaqa llapanpim chaymanta aswan achka ruwaykunata ruwanqa.
Another great time.	Huk hatun pacha.
Yeah go then, why not.	Arí riy chaymantaqa, imaraykutaq mana.
They were not very happy about it.	Chaywanqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqaku.
That was very sad for you.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi karqa qampaq.
It was a very great night.	Ancha hatun tutam karqa.
Ten days was not good enough.	Chunka punchawqa manam allinchu karqa.
Everything makes sense.	Tukuy imapas sumaq yuyayniyuqmi.
Where he wants to.	Maypichus munan.
Not like he’s angry.	Mana phiñasqa hinachu.
I haven’t been well since.	Chaymanta pacha mana allinchu kani.
If there once was.	Sichus huk kutipi karqan chayqa.
That’s pretty cool.	Chayqa ancha chiri.
We are not ready now.	Kunanqa manam listochu kachkaniku.
He’s a great big guy.	Payqa hatun hatunmi.
I think that's good for you.	Chayqa qampaq allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I don't know how else to say it.	Manam yachanichu imaynata hukmanta rimanaypaq.
That should be everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas kanan.
He talks about it immediately.	Chaymantam chaylla riman.
Maybe they're a little too fast.	Ichapas huk chikan llumpay utqaylla kachkanku.
But this is what you need to do.	Ichaqa kaytan ruwanayki.
That is always a bad thing.	Chayqa sapa kutim mana allinchu.
Maybe a little too well though.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha allinta ichaqa.
He wanted it very badly.	Ancha mana allintam munarqa.
This one, however, was pretty big.	Kaymi ichaqa ancha hatun karqa.
But before that.	Ichaqa manaraq chaymanta.
I happily said yes.	Kusisqam arí nirqani.
He didn't know what the problem was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
You’re human, that’s all.	Runa kanki, chaylla.
In fact, he did.	Chiqaptaqa chaynatam ruwarqa.
You were so easy on me, actually.	Qamqa ancha facilmi karqanki ñuqapaq, chiqaptaqa.
It's always something new.	Sapa kutim imapas musuq kaq.
Fast and efficient.	Utqaylla hinaspa allin ruwaq.
I don’t want to be like this.	Manam kayna kayta munanichu.
I thought he would win.	Paymi atipananta yuyaykurqani.
This is the third season.	Kaymi kimsa kaq pacha.
You’re probably pretty serious.	Yaqapaschá allintachu serio kanki.
that would never do.	chayqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanmanchu.
This is something .	Kayqa imapas .
A married man.	Casarasqa runa.
That's not right, that's not right.	Chayqa manam allinchu, chayqa manam allinchu.
Learn the right thing.	Allinta yachay.
This can often be a mistake.	Kayqa yaqa llapanpim pantasqa kanman.
That something like that would happen.	Chayna imapas pasananta.
Strong though.	Sinchi ichaqa.
It still doesn't sound right.	Hinallam mana allintachu uyarikun.
I didn’t realize that.	Mana chayta repararqanichu.
But with that	Chaywanmi ichaqa .
Plus everything else above.	Astawan tukuy ima hawapi.
He is not like humans.	Payqa manan runakuna hinachu.
We cannot be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atichwanchu.
Or, maybe, three.	Utaq, ichapas, kimsa.
And he said no.	Hinan payqa mana nirqanchu.
So, thank you very much.	Chaymi, anchata gracias.
You really should.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanayki.
He did not know what would happen next.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu qhepaman imachus pasananta.
But not like that guy.	Ichaqa manan chay wayna hinachu.
Be fast, but do it right.	Utqaylla kay, ichaqa allinta ruway.
First of all, the problem.	Ñawpaqtaqa chay sasachakuy.
This had to be something else.	Kayqa huk imapas kanan karqa.
That’s all for now.	Chayllam kunankamaqa.
But it may not be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá hinachu kanman.
I was almost excited.	Yaqapaschá kusisqa karqani.
And you’re sick.	Hinaspa unqusqa kanki.
The whole process is great.	Tukuy ruwayqa hatunmi.
I’m not like the last one.	Ñoqaqa manan qhepa kaq hinachu kani.
But in most cases.	Ichaqa yaqa llapanpim.
The man is happy.	Chay runaqa kusisqam kachkan.
Another child,’ he said.	Huk wawa’, nispas nin.
It’s been a year now.	Kunanqa huk watañam.
The whole process will be easier.	Llapan ruwaymi aswan facil kanqa.
But it doesn’t seem to be that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanman hina.
Perhaps they were, in a sense.	Ichapas chayna karqaku, huk nisqanman hina.
That’s what a great man does.	Chaytan ruwan hatun runaqa.
Better than that.	Aswan allin chaymanta.
Really be there.	Chiqamanta chaypi kay.
He never wanted to leave.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ripuyta munarqanchu.
I will do everything right for you.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwasaq qampaq.
No, it’s really good.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin allin.
This is the modern reality.	Kunan pacha chiqap kaqmi kay.
There is nothing about it here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas chaymantaqa kanchu.
All this black.	Tukuy kay yana.
Tell me everything.	Tukuy willaway.
It seems to make more sense.	Aswan allin yuyayniyuq hinam.
And then what happened next.	Hinaspa chaymanta imakuna chaymanta pasasqanmanta.
That’s where I’m at.	Chayna chaypim kachkani.
It means something else.	Huk niyta munan.
He wanted me to get that right with you first.	Payqa munarqanmi chayta qanwan ñawpaqta allinta ruwanayta.
I suspect she is the problem.	Sospechani paymi chay sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Very new fact.	Ancha musuq chiqap.
He knew how to do it, but he couldn’t do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwayta, ichaqa manan ruwayta atirqanchu.
That was very clear last year.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan qayna wata.
Very good, all things considered.	Ancha allin, tukuy ima qhawarisqa.
A lot, he said.	Achka, nispa.
It happened very often.	Ancha sapa kutim pasarqa.
There is never any talk.	Manam haykapipas rimayqa kanchu.
But we disagree with that.	Ichaqa manan chaywanqa acuerdopichu kayku.
It really was that bad.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina millay karqan.
So here is the problem.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan chay sasachakuy.
Everything goes from there.	Tukuy imapas chaymantam rin.
And he said he didn’t know.	Hinaspa mana yachasqayta nisqa.
He was a good player.	Payqa allin pukllaqmi karqan.
I was just so tired.	Chayraqmi ancha sayk'usqa karqani.
Then it will do the action.	Chaymantaqa ruwayta ruwanqa.
There is a snowstorm somewhere.	Maypipas kanmi kan.
But he was here yesterday.	Ichaqa qayna punchawmi kaypi karqa.
So this next one is the best.	Chaymi kay qatiqnin aswan allin kaq.
No one could do it for me.	Manam pipas ñuqapaq ruwayta atirqachu.
That is not true anywhere.	Chayqa manan maypipas cheqaqchu.
Better, some horror, a little horror.	Aswan allin, wakin manchay, huk chikan manchay.
It's safer this way.	Kay hinaqa aswan segurom.
I have and.	Ñuqaqa kanmi hinaspa.
This approach can be useful.	Kay ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
So, things went wrong.	Chaymi, imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
He was right with her.	Payqa allintam paywan karqa.
Now he couldn’t even do that.	Kunanqa manañan chayta ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
You’re a bad guy.	Mana allin runam kanki.
Maybe he’s in jail.	Ichapas carcelpi kachkan.
This way, if you like.	Kay hinata, munaspaqa.
You are doing very well here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwachkanki.
That it’s just not the greatest thing.	Chaylla mana aswan hatun kaq kasqanmanta.
Maybe this would make a good movie.	Ichapas kayqa allin peliculata ruwanman.
I, unfortunately, was not there.	Ñuqa, llakikuypaqmi, mana chaypichu karqani.
Now I hardly think or see it.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá mana yuyaykunichu nitaq rikunichu.
I had a really big problem.	Chiqaptam hatun sasachakuypi tarikurqani.
It was a good place to go next.	Allinmi karqan qatiqnin rinanpaq.
There, that means something.	Chaypi, chayqa imapas niyta munan.
Things will work out anyway.	Imapas allintam kanqa imayna kaptinpas.
He took the road.	Payqa ñanta hap’irqan.
This person is you.	Kay runaqa qanmi kanki.
Tougher and tougher.	Aswan sinchi hinaspa aswan sinchi.
I can’t really reach out and overdo it.	Manam chiqaptachu chayayta hinaspa llumpayta ruwayta atiyman.
You just didn't know that was true.	Chaylla mana yacharqankichu chay chiqap kasqanmanta.
I like them all, really.	Llapallankum gustan, chiqaptapuni.
And he’s very angry.	Hinaspa payqa ancha phiñasqa kashan.
I am not sure what happened.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
That’s what he did all the time.	Chaytan sapa kutilla ruwaq.
He doesn't know what's wrong.	Payqa manam yachanchu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I thought it was good.	Ñuqaqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He would love to know the truth.	Payqa anchatan munanman cheqaq kaqta yachayta.
What he’s all about.	Imamantataq payqa tukuy imamanta rimachkan.
It's really not that bad to do.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu ruwayqa.
He couldn’t hear it anymore.	Manañam uyariyta atirqachu.
We certainly failed.	Cheqaqtapunin mana allintachu ruwarqayku.
He didn’t want to hear an answer.	Payqa manan kutichiyta uyariyta munarqanchu.
Of course, you can’t.	Chiqamanta, mana atiwaqchu.
It wasn’t, at all.	Manam karqachu, ni imapipas.
That’s what he’s been doing ever since.	Chayqa chaymanta pacha ruwan.
Nothing now.	Mana imapas kunanqa.
You did very, very well.	Ancha, ancha allintam ruwarqanki.
But really, it won't work.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam allinchu kanqa.
I don't believe it is.	Manam creenichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe I was stupid.	Ichapas ñuqaqa sonso karqani.
There were no pedestrians anywhere.	Manam maypipas puriq runakunaqa karqachu.
He can never leave soon enough.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhaylla ripuyta atinmanchu.
He does something.	Payqa imatapas ruwan.
You can’t get rid of him.	Manam paymanta lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
And better yet go.	Hinaspa aswan allinqa riy.
The man looked furious.	Chay runaqa sinchi phiñasqa qhawarisqa.
You will find out one day.	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi yachanki.
Maybe you’re like me.	Ichapas qampas ñuqa hina kanki.
So very tired.	Chaymi ancha sayk’usqa.
For some reason, it sounds really bad.	Imaraykupas, chiqap mana allin uyarikun.
The person thinks you are right for him.	Chay runaqa piensanmi paypaq hina kasqaykita.
I want to know how and why he did it.	Imayna ruwasqanmanta, imarayku ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani.
She is very nice as always.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi sapa kuti hina.
But it doesn’t seem that bad.	Ichaqa manan chay hina mana allinchu rikch’akun.
He said it over and over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim sapa kutim nirqa.
Hidden, but very real.	Pakasqa, ichaqa ancha chiqap.
I don’t understand how you do it.	Manam entiendenichu imayna ruwasqaykita.
That’s two heads.	Chayqa iskay uma.
I could have done very well without it.	Mana chaywanqa ancha allintam ruwayman karqa.
Do more than that.	Chaymanta astawan ruway.
Now it looks like it did back then.	Kunanqa chay tiempopi hinam rikchakun.
It would be very easy.	Ancha facilmi kanman chay ruwayqa.
I've never heard of a place to tell.	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu maypi willayta.
I knew exactly how he felt.	Allintam yacharqani imayna sientekusqanmanta.
You didn't know what he wanted.	Manam yacharqankichu ima munasqanta.
Here, he can’t.	Kaypiqa, manam atinchu.
I didn't want to see that.	Chaytaqa manam qawayta munarqanichu.
It may have been a while.	Yaqapaschá huk tiempo karqan.
An ugly one, if you think about it.	Huk millay kaq, sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
Like the first two people.	Ñawpaq iskay runakuna hina.
Perhaps he wants to buy time.	Yaqapaschá tiempota rantiyta munan.
It will be ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam kanqa.
I think it’s you.	Yuyaykuni qanmi.
I don’t want a gift.	Manam huk regalota munanichu.
That’s why I’m so excited.	Chayraykum anchata kusikuni.
I mean he was worried.	Payqa llakisqa kasqanmantam niyta munani.
So it was the best thing ever.	Chaymi aswan allinqa karqa.
But he didn’t think he would be unpopular.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu mana allin qhawarisqa kananpaq.
Now I know why.	Kunanqa yachanin imarayku chayta.
He later died of it.	Payqa qhepamanmi chaymanta wañupurqan.
But this seems excessive.	Ichaqa kayqa llumpay hinam.
Not about anything.	Mana imamanta.
Not as happy as before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu ancha kusisqa.
But you're going to get hurt.	Ichaqa k'irisqa kanki.
You will learn more about him later.	Qhepamanmi paymanta astawan yachanki.
It will be safe, all right.	Seguro kanqa, allinmi.
Unfortunately, there was a mistake.	Llakikuypaqmi, chaypiqa huk pantasqa karqan.
He had been like that for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chhayna kasqa.
Maybe that’s all he really wants.	Ichapas chaylla chiqaptapuni munan.
The man was obviously insane.	Chay runaqa sut’inmi loco kasqa.
It was good to be smart.	Allinmi karqa yachaysapa kayqa.
I think he’ll be back.	Yuyaykuni kutimunanta.
That was sort of it.	Chayqa karqa huk laya.
That’s the big reason why.	Chay hatun imarayku.
I really need to be better.	Chiqamanta aswan allin kanay tiyan.
He said he couldn't see for a while.	Payqa nirqam huk rato mana rikuyta atisqanmanta.
I probably said that.	Yaqapaschá chayta nirqani.
I just couldn’t understand why.	Chaylla mana entiendeyta atirqanichu imarayku chayta.
I want to be out there.	Chay hawapi kayta munani.
That seems too big to be true.	Chayqa ancha hatunmi rikchakun, chaymi mana allinchu kanman.
Nothing at all.	Mana imapas ni imapipas.
And, again, no.	Hinaspa, yapamanta, mana.
I want to fix some things.	Wakin imakunatapas allichayta munani.
Then, the second one.	Chaymanta, iskay kaq.
But this will be the last time.	Ichaqa kaymi kanqa qhepa kuti.
I never believe that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa creenichu.
People love it so much.	Runakunaqa anchatam munanku.
I never heard of one being there.	Manam haykapipas uyarirqanichu huknin chaypi kasqanmantaqa.
Almost inhumanly so.	Yaqa mana runa hina chayna.
One happened a few days ago.	Hukninmi pasarqa iskay kimsa punchaw ñawpaqta.
They were good people.	Paykunaqa allin runam karqaku.
He was the first, after all.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq karqa, tukuy imamanta.
I know he was waiting.	Yachanim suyasqanmanta.
I'm always with someone, really.	Sapa kutim piwanpas kani, chiqaptapuni.
Clearly there's something.	Sut'inmi imapas kan.
In fact, they are not.	Aswanpas manan chay hinachu kanku.
So he was pretty sure.	Chaymi payqa allin seguro kasharqan.
No one wants that.	Manam pipas chayta munanchu.
I don’t hear it that way.	Manam chaynatachu uyarini.
That’s why they were here.	Chayraykum kaypi karqaku.
So, it’s very hard to do this.	Chayna, ancha sasam kayta ruwayqa.
He was really great.	Payqa chiqap hatunmi karqa.
I just wanted him to leave.	Chaylla munarqani ripunanpaq.
I'm sick and tired of it.	Unqusqa, sayk'usqa kani chaymanta.
It’s really something crazy.	Chiqaptam imapas loco.
And it's actually not always a bad thing.	Hinaspa chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu mana allinqa.
This process is a familiar one.	Kay ruwayqa riqsisqa ruwaymi.
No, never, never.	Manan, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
Okay, he might be a little crazy.	Allinmi, payqa huk chikan loco kanman.
They are pretty good people.	Paykunaqa sumaq allin runakunam kanku.
I don’t know not to work.	Manam yachanichu mana llamkayta.
Yes, it was beautiful.	Arí, sumaqmi karqa.
Both were bad speakers.	Iskayninkum mana allin rimaq karqaku.
He acted like a very scared person.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa runa hinam ruwarqa.
Yes, it is a beautiful day.	Arí, sumaq punchawmi.
He couldn't come soon enough.	Manam chaylla hamuyta atirqachu.
Something like that nasty thing out there.	Imapas chay millay kaq hina chay hawapi.
I’m glad to be with you.	Kusikuni qanwan kaspa.
She knew he expected her not to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwananta suyasqanmanta.
I'm pretty sure no one could say that.	Yaqa segurom kani mana pipas chay niyta atisqanmanta.
The process can take some time.	Chay ruwayqa huk tiempon kanman.
But first, some background.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa wakin ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Which ? 	Mayqin ?
Don’t know what time it is, don’t care.	Ama yachankichu ima hora kasqanmanta, ama imananpaschu.
He couldn't speak or anything.	Mana rimayta atirqachu nitaq imatapas.
It still does, in fact.	Hinallam ruwan, chiqaptaqa.
But, not sure how about that.	Ichaqa, mana segurochu imaynatachus chaymanta.
He looked very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa hinan qhawarisqa.
He was like that.	Payqa hinan karqan.
It's so easy it's ridiculous.	Ancha facilmi asikunapaq hinam.
I always have them with me.	Sapa kutim chaykunataqa ñuqawan kuska kani.
I didn’t want to think about it.	Manam chaypi yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
But it wasn’t an act of friendship.	Ichaqa manan amigontin kay ruwaychu karqan.
But it means something.	Ichaqa imapas niyta munanmi.
You can’t really see it.	Chiqaptaqa manam qawayta atiwaqchu.
I mean, yeah, please.	Niyta munani, arí, ama hina kaspa.
They want to be rich.	Paykunaqa qhapaq kaytam munanku.
And then .	Hinaspa chaymantaqa .
That sounds like a big deal.	Chayqa hatun ruway hinam uyarikun.
I feel there is more than one here.	Kaypiqa hukmanta aswan achka kasqanmantam sientekuni.
The fastest one.	Aswan utqaylla kaq.
He didn’t know how he knew that, but he did.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta yachasqanmanta, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
I wish you could.	Munaymanmi atisqaykita.
But it’s good for you.	Ichaqa allinmi qanpaq.
That's obvious to me.	Chayqa sut'inmi ñuqapaq.
I thought, now it will have to be someone else.	Yuyarqanim, kunanqa huk runam kanan kanqa.
But anything else would be a big surprise.	Ichaqa imapas huk ruwayqa hatun admirakuypaqmi kanman.
Every day someone wants to see him.	Sapa punchawmi pipas payta qawayta munan.
If he is not happy.	Mana kusisqa kaptinqa.
Something is certainly right here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi imapas allin kashan.
So it’s very ugly.	Chaymi ancha millay.
Ten years later, however.	Chunka wata qhepamanmi ichaqa.
Tougher now.	Aswan sinchi kunan.
No second thoughts.	Mana iskay kaq yuyayniyuq.
I really am a very nice person.	Chiqaptam ancha sumaq runa kani.
But he knew he would.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chay ruwananta.
Not a new baby.	Mana musuq wawa.
However, it actually worked out well.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa allintam lluqsirqa.
You’ll be sick that whole morning.	Chay tukuy paqarin unqusqa kanki.
He doesn't seem overly concerned at all.	Manam llumpay llakisqa hinachu rikchakun ni imapipas.
No one was quite sure.	Manam pipas allintachu seguro karqa.
He should be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanan.
Like, like now.	Imayna, kunan hina.
I wonder if that’s the case.	Tapukuni sichus chayna kanman chayta.
He was short-sighted.	Payqa pisi yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
One day is like another.	Huk punchawmi huk punchaw hina.
It was a great year.	Hatun wata karqan.
He knew the consequences.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaymanta imakuna kananta.
He is in good health.	Allin unqusqa kachkan.
Maybe something really bad happened.	Ichapas imapas chiqap mana allin pasarqa.
I was afraid to tell anyone.	Pimanpas willayta mancharisqa karqani.
But he's tired.	Ichaqa sayk'usqañan kashan.
That would have been me.	Chayqa ñuqa kanman karqan.
Something could have gone wrong, it went wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman karqan, mana allintachu rirqan.
No, this was not true.	Manan, kayqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
To be hurt again.	Hukmanta k’irisqa kananpaq.
Like you,’ he says.	Qan hina’, nispas nin.
There's nothing really wrong with that, he said.	Chaypiqa manam imapas chiqap mana allinchu, nispas nin.
Do what you do, everything you do.	Ruway ruwasqaykita, tukuy ruwasqaykita.
I have no idea if it will work for you.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani sichus qampaq allin kanqa icha manachu chayta.
Like, very, very nice.	Imayna, ancha, ancha sumaq.
If you don’t want to know this.	Kayta mana yachayta munaspaqa.
In fact, one thought he did.	Aswanpas huk runaqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruwasqanmanta.
And they’re good.	Hinaspa paykunaqa allinmi kanku.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu kanman.
So, it speaks again.	Chaymi, hukmanta riman.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana imapaqpas allinchu.
If this is a problem let me know.	Sichus kay sasachakuy kanman chayqa willaway.
I'm quite serious.	Ñuqaqa allintam serio kachkani.
He didn’t want to do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta munarqanchu.
We took the first steps.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
He was a very secretive person.	Payqa llumpay pakasqa runam karqa.
Something had to happen immediately.	Imapas chayllam kanan karqa.
Twenty people, he said.	Iskay chunka runakuna, nispas nisqa.
I didn't expect how much it was.	Manam suyarqanichu hayka hayka kasqanmantaqa.
He was as popular as the settlers.	Payqa tiyaq runakuna hinam ancha riqsisqa karqa.
Now, he’s a no-brainer.	Kunanqa, payqa mana yuyayniyuqmi.
It is hidden for now.	Kunankamaqa pakasqa kachkan.
You don’t know.	Mana yachankichu.
But what was the truth.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq karqan cheqaq kaq.
This is the most important step.	Kayqa aswan importante ruwaymi.
He's obviously very angry.	Payqa sut'inmi ancha phiñasqa kashan.
They are human after all.	Paykunaqa runan kanku tukuy imamanta.
What’s the best thing.	Imataq aswan allin.
It all seems so simple.	Tukuy imapas ancha facilmi rikchakun.
I know that is true.	Yachanim chayna chiqap kasqanmanta.
In fact, something very interesting happened.	Chiqaptaqa, imapas ancha sumaqmi pasarqa.
Just that, something more.	Chaylla, imapas aswan.
Nothing wrong, three years good.	Mana ima mana allinchu, kimsa wata allin.
A real lot.	Huk chiqap achka.
Often once a month.	Sapa kuti killapi huk kutita.
He didn’t know why, exactly, but he did.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chayta, allinta, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
Unfortunately, it's not quite there.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam allintachu chaypi kachkan.
Learn to make really good coffee.	Chiqamanta allin kukata ruwayta yachay.
Was there a.	¿Karqachu huk.
You have no idea how big it is yet.	Manaraqmi yuyayniyuqchu kanki imayna hatun kasqanmanta.
But he knows it’s not.	Ichaqa yachanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
And again a week after that.	Hinaspa yapamanta huk semana chaymanta.
There is nothing we can do now.	Manam kunanqa ima ruwaytapas atichwanchu.
They were both hungry.	Iskayninkum yarqaymanta karqaku.
I didn’t do anything for you.	Manam imatapas qampaq ruwarqanichu.
But I still feel sad.	Ichaqa hinallam llakikuni.
Okay, never mind.	Allinmi, mana haykapipas.
I was safe and secure.	Ñuqaqa seguro hinaspa segurom karqani.
He knew there was a problem.	Payqa yacharqanmi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
He just knew what it was.	Chayllaraqmi yacharqa ima kasqanmanta.
I’m sure he can do that.	Seguro kani chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
This is like a world.	Kayqa huk pacha hinam.
It’s bad, sometimes.	Mana allinmi, wakin kuti.
Still not good, but it was good.	Hinallam mana allinchu, ichaqa allinmi karqa.
Better than you, maybe.	Aswan allin qammanta, ichapas.
There is no point in talking.	Mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​rimayqa.
Worse than me.	Ñoqamanta aswan mana allin.
And here you are.	Hinaspa kaypi kanki.
And then, well, nothing.	Hinaspa chaymanta, allinmi, mana imapas.
He will do this job.	Paymi kay llamkayta ruwanqa.
Let me know if everything goes well.	Tukuy imapas allin kaptinqa willaway.
But I didn’t make it into a big deal.	Ichaqa manan hatun ruwaymanchu ruwarqani.
She was tired of me now.	Payqa kunanqa sayk’usqañan kasharqan ñoqamanta.
It says a lot about you.	Achkatam qammanta riman.
Looked really good.	Chiqamanta allinta qhawarisqa.
That’s a great success.	Chayqa hatun allin ruwaymi.
If not, there is something wrong with the timing.	Mana chayna kaptinqa, tiempopiqa imapas mana allinmi kachkan.
He was certainly the funniest.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin aswan asikunapaq hina karqan.
Sometimes like crazy.	Wakin kutipi loco hina.
But today he seemed sad.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi llakisqa hina tarikurqa.
There was an injury.	Huk k’irisqa karqan.
Go for a night walk.	Tuta puriq riy.
It’s really nice, actually.	Chiqamanta sumaq, chiqamanta.
Being a child yourself.	Kikin wawa kaspa.
It probably took about three months.	Yaqapaschá yaqa kimsa killa pasarqa.
You know, in this city .	Yachanki, kay llaqtapi .
Otherwise do it now.	Mana chayqa kunan ruway.
Someone who talks to me.	Pipas ñuqawan rimaq.
He can do that tomorrow.	Payqa paqarinmi chayta ruwanman.
It’s really sad.	Chiqap llakikuypaqmi.
I really wanted to be there.	Anchatan munarqani chaypi kayta.
I can’t say it won’t happen, with or without me.	Manam niyta atinichu mana pasananta, ñuqawan utaq mana ñuqawan.
Therefore, the	Chayraykum chay .
Yes, there is someone.	Arí, pipas kanmi.
That was a really hard time.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sasa tiempo karqan.
He wanted to see her again.	Hukmanta rikuyta munarqa.
No one seems to be sure.	Manas pipas segurochu kanman hina.
Make who you are right.	Pichus kasqaykita allinta ruway.
Maybe a little crazy.	Ichapas huk chikan loco.
Perhaps it would have been better if you had .	Ichapas aswan allin kanman karqa qamqa .
He’s not really hurt, he’s angry.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu k’irisqa kashan, aswanpas phiñasqa kashan.
Everyone was drunk.	Lliwmi machasqa karqaku.
An early day.	Huk ñawpaq p’unchaw.
I wasn’t happy anymore.	Manañam kusisqachu karqani.
Later they were not.	Qhepamanmi mana chay hinachu karqanku.
Very, very, very scary.	Ancha, ancha, ancha manchay.
It’s hard to tell now.	Sasa kunan willay.
That's the newest thing.	Chayqa aswan musuq kaqmi.
There was a man there.	Huk runam chaypi kachkarqa.
They are very, very tough.	Paykunaqa ancha, ancha sinchi kanku.
Everything else would be secondary.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaq kanman.
If not, better for you.	Mana chayqa, aswan allinmi qanpaq.
It was considered, again.	Chayqa qhawarisqa karqan, yapamanta.
I’m set up.	Ñuqaqa churasqa kachkani.
Day and night, they were.	Tuta punchaw, chayna karqaku.
You can do a lot with it.	Chaywanmi achkata ruwawaq.
Fortunately he wasn’t alone.	Ancha kusisqa mana sapallanchu karqa.
Never had a reason before.	Mana hayk'aqpas ñawpaqtaqa imaraykupas karqanchu.
If you want to be less people, go here.	Aswan pisi runakuna kayta munanki chayqa, kayman riy.
I really had no idea why.	Chiqamanta mana yuyayniyuqchu karqani imarayku.
No, it doesn’t seem like it.	Manan, manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
Fool that he was, he wanted to be.	Sonso chay payqa karqan, payqa kayta munarqan.
No one much.	Mana pipas anchatachu.
Everyone knows it’s foolish.	Lliwmi yachanku mana yuyayniyuq kasqanmanta.
I’m not a nice guy.	Manam sumaq runachu kani.
Or a year ago.	Utaq huk wata ñawpaqta.
You were here at night.	Tuta kaypi karqanki.
Big, dark, handsome.	Hatun, yana, sumaq rikchayniyuq.
But things still went wrong.	Ichaqa hinallam tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
Do it twice in half the time.	Kuskan tiempopi iskay kutita ruway.
This is the best way to keep it simple.	Kayqa aswan allinmi mana sasa ruway kananpaq.
Unless you’re beautiful, of course.	Manachus sumaq kanki chayqa, sut’inmi.
There is nothing worthwhile about it.	Chaypaqqa manam imapas valenchu.
He was a great, great man.	Payqa hatun, hatun runam karqa.
I’m glad it’s not, you know, the other house.	Kusikuni mana, yachanki, huknin wasi kasqanmanta.
He's really crazy.	Payqa chiqaptam loco.
He will be sure.	Payqa segurom kanqa.
I wanted him, so badly.	Payta munarqani, ancha millay.
He can’t stand being alone.	Payqa manan aguantayta atinchu sapallan kayta.
In most cases, you will too.	Yaqa llapanpim qampas chaynata ruwanki.
He did it in a serious way.	Chaytaqa sinchitan ruwarqan.
He’s really excited about it.	Payqa chiqamanta kusisqa kachkan chaymanta.
I don’t want to do it again.	Manam hukmanta ruwayta munanichu.
I don’t think we should.	Manam yuyanichu chayta ruwananchikpaq.
He was depressed.	Payqa llakisqa kasqa.
I can't figure out how to fix it.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imayna allichayta.
He knows nothing about her not being here anymore.	Manam imatapas yachanchu manaña kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
That’s the way it is.	Chhayna kanman.
Okay, several times a week every day.	Allinmi, semanapi achka kutita sapa punchaw.
Maybe next year, right?.	Ichapas hamuq wata, ¿aw?.
He died two months later.	Iskay killa qhepamanmi wañupurqan.
This guy knows stuff.	Kay runaqa imakunatapas yachan.
We are safer here than anywhere else.	Kaypiqa aswan segurom kachkaniku maypipas.
It wouldn’t have been bad.	Manam mana allinchu kanman karqa.
It might not be that bad.	Manapaschá chayna mana allinchu kanman.
Know, I really want to.	Yachay, chiqaptam munani.
Say he doesn’t have to.	Niy mana ruwananchu nispa.
Such a statement is absurd.	Chayna rimayqa mana yuyayniyuq kay.
The third person.	Kimsa kaq runa.
And he made a statement.	Hinaspa huk willakuyta ruwarqa.
By doing it now.	Kunan ruwaspa.
There is nothing without it, there is something with it.	Mana chaywanqa manam imapas kanchu, chaywanqa imapas kanmi.
He thought hard about it.	Chaytaqa sinchitan yuyaykurqan.
I think it’s fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
But he actually said it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa nirqan.
Not to that at all.	Mana chaymanqa ni imapipas.
We couldn’t be happier.	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atichwanchu.
Nobody says much.	Manam pipas anchatachu nin.
Do one big thing every day.	Sapa punchawmi huk hatun llamkayta ruway.
He said it was all right.	Allinmi nispa nirqa.
Therein lies the problem indeed.	Chaypin cheqaqtapuni chay sasachakuy kashan.
He does this once or more.	Chaytaqa huk kutita utaq achka kutitam ruwan.
And this is unfortunate.	Hinaspa kayqa llakikuypaqmi.
There is no food or anything else here.	Kaypiqa manam mikhuy kanchu nitaq imapas kanchu.
You’re not that good.	Chayna mana allinchu kanki.
Do something, not that.	Imatapas ruway, mana chayta.
They want results.	Paykunaqa munanku imapas ruwaykunata.
This was just as bad as the last one.	Kayqa qhipa kaq hina mana allinchu karqan.
He had to go fast.	Payqa usqhayllan rinan karqan.
I want to hear the whole story.	Tukuy willakuyta uyariyta munani.
Share what you learned by doing so.	Chayta ruwaspa yachasqaykita willay.
He will do something.	Paymi imatapas ruwanqa.
Or do you not want to deal with it?.	Icha, ¿manachu chayta atipayta munanki?.
But again, this is not true.	Ichaqa yapamanta, kayqa manan cheqaqchu.
So, it’s not.	Chaymi, mana.
You are a treasure.	Qamqa huk qhapaq kaymi kanki.
That’s a lot of mystery.	Chayqa ancha pakasqa.
Almost always for the better.	Yaqa sapa kutim allinpaq.
You repeat this twice.	Kaytaqa iskay kutitam yapamanta ruwanki.
It was every night.	Sapa tutam karqa.
It’s the hardest part.	Aswan sasa kaqmi.
You have no idea where it is.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kanki maypi kasqanmantaqa.
I was never happy there.	Chaypiqa manam haykapipas kusisqachu karqani.
Yes, you know all about it.	Arí, chaymantaqa tukuy imatam yachanki.
I wasn't sure either.	Ñuqapas manam segurochu karqani.
So something had to be done.	Chaymi imatapas ruwana karqa.
But it was a wonderful thing.	Ichaqa huk sumaq ruwaymi karqan.
I was sure no one would know.	Seguro karqani mana pipas yachananta.
He was really funny.	Payqa chiqaptam asikunapaq hina karqa.
There is no duality.	Manam iskay kay kanchu.
I don't know how to take it seriously.	Manam yachanichu imaynatam serio hapiyta.
So go with that.	Chaymi chaywan riy.
Otherwise it’s all good.	Mana chayqa tukuy allin.
It was the next day.	Paqarin punchawmi karqa.
And saying how easy it is.	Hinaspa imayna facil kasqanmanta nispa.
But first the good stuff.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa allin kaqmi.
What is the weather.	Imataq pacha.
I know how and why it happened.	Yachanim imayna hinaspa imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But there is a fact.	Ichaqa kanmi cheqaq kaq.
I didn’t want to hear or know anymore.	Manañam uyariyta nitaq yachayta munarqanichu.
He was a little unsure.	Payqa huk chhikantan mana segurochu kasqa.
But maybe there was something.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas karqa.
So fucking great.	Chaymi millay hatun.
If you’re here let me know.	Sichus kaypi kashanki chayqa willaway.
I’ll go with that.	Chaywanmi risaq.
They were all very ugly.	Llapallankum ancha millay karqaku.
Why else would you.	Imaraykutaq hukta.
Yes, young and beautiful .	Arí, wayna hinaspa sumaq .
One can wait.	Hukninmi suyayta atinman.
They were very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa karqanku.
So this had to be.	Chaymi kayqa kanan karqa.
I want to eat.	Mikhuyta munani.
I agree they are not.	Ñuqaqa acuerdopi kani mana kasqankuta.
Scientists want a good job.	Yachaysapa runakunam munanku allin llamkayta.
This is still not really good.	Kayqa manaraqmi chiqap allinchu.
That certainly would be the case here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypiqa chhayna kanman.
He was sure there was nothing.	Payqa segurom karqa mana imapas kasqanmanta.
You seemed surprised.	Admirasqa hinam karqanki.
He didn’t know what, if anything, that might be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima, sichus imapas kanman chayqa, chay kanman.
Tell me one thing.	Hukta willaway.
So these are pretty much what they mean.	Chaymi kaykunaqa yaqapaschá rikchakun ima niyta munan.
I'd rather leave.	Aswan allinmi kanman ripuyta.
That this morning.	Chay kunan paqarin.
I know about that.	Chaymantaqa yachanim.
You know, we did the work.	Yachanki, llamk'ayta ruwarqayku.
Then another ten.	Chaymanta huk chunka.
That gave him some time.	Chayqa huk chhikantan tiempota qorqan.
I want to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwayta munani.
He knew how bad it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
Now I knew all that.	Kunanqa tukuy chaytan yacharqani.
But that's all he has with me.	Ichaqa chayllam payqa ñuqawan kachkan.
But we are very happy that we did.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqam kachkaniku chayta ruwasqaykumanta.
Something in there.	Imapas chaypi.
I don’t need that at all.	Chaytaqa manan ni imapipas necesitasaqchu.
Maybe like a little house.	Ichapas huk chikan wasi hina.
This is right here.	Kayqa kaypim kachkan.
That wouldn’t be so good.	Chayqa manan chay hina allinchu kanman.
That he wanted her now.	Chay kunan payta munasqanmanta.
I’m sorry, but he won’t do it.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa manan payqa ruwanqachu.
It would be better not to do so.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaynata ruwayqa.
I hope not so much.	Suyachkani mana chaynatachu.
You can’t focus on it.	Manam chaypiqa yuyaymanayta atiwaqchu.
I learned a lot from what he did.	Achkatam yacharqani chay ruwasqanmanta.
Do it right, do it once.	Allinta ruway, huk kutilla ruway.
Now he doesn't want to ask anyone.	Kunanqa manañam pitapas tapuyta munanchu.
After that, you were on your own.	Chay qhepamanmi sapallayki karqanki.
You’ve done some stupid things too.	Qampas wakin sonso ruwaykunata ruwarqanki.
She’s a good girl.	Allin sipasmi kachkan.
Be that way.	Chay hinata kay.
I don’t need money.	Manam qullqita necesitasaqchu.
And that was something.	Hinaspa chayqa imapas karqa.
Something bigger.	Imapas aswan hatun.
I just learned that.	Chayllaraqmi chaytaqa yacharqani.
However, it is recommended that you do this more frequently.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman chayta aswan sapa kuti ruwanaykipaq.
I just couldn’t figure out why.	Chaylla mana yachayta atirqanichu imarayku chayta.
What is the right thing?.	¿Ima allinchu?.
I want to go play.	Pukllaq riyta munani.
He would like to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munanman.
He did that to her now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi paywan ruwarqa.
That seemed very sad.	Chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi rikchakurqa.
They seem very angry.	Paykunaqa ancha phiñasqa hinam kanku.
You’ve done the job.	Qanmi chay llank’ayta ruwarqanki.
You have so many ideas.	Ancha achka yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
So he’s in town.	Chaymi payqa llaqtapi kashan.
It has been around for about a year now.	Kunanqa yaqa huk watañam kachkan.
Couldn’t stop what happened to you.	Mana hark’ayta atirqanchu imachus qanwan pasananta.
This all makes no sense.	Kay tukuy imapas mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Don't be afraid.	Ama mancharisqa hina kaychu.
I take it that way.	Ñuqaqa chaynata hapini.
I wasn’t feeling well anymore.	Ñuqaqa manañam allinchu karqani.
Yes, it looked great.	Arí, ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Just do it and you will succeed.	Chaylla ruway hinaspa allinta ruwanki.
He can be hurt, frustrated, and depressed.	Payqa k’irisqa, hukmanyasqa, llakisqa ima kanman.
That didn't go well.	Chayqa manam allintachu rirqa.
It was a difficult thing to do.	Chaytaqa sasa ruwaymi karqa.
I know it's beautiful now.	Yachanim kunan sumaq kasqanmanta.
Every day was something else.	Sapa punchawmi huk imapas karqa.
I suspect it’s good.	Sospechani allin kasqanmanta.
He was always there, she said.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi karqan, nispas nin.
Like other people.	Huk runakuna hina.
He certainly does.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwan.
Not today anyway.	Mana kunan punchawchu imayna kaptinpas.
He had to be alone.	Sapallanmi kanan karqa.
It’s nothing like what came before.	Manan imapas ñawpaq hamuq hinachu.
You know, every player is a little bit different.	Yachanki, sapa pukllaqmi huk chikan chikan.
Maybe there is, but probably not.	Ichapas kanman, ichaqa manapaschá.
Maybe but maybe not.	Ichapas ichaqa manapaschá kanqachu.
It never means that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa niyta munanchu.
Being in the front is always the best.	Ñawpaqpi kayqa sapa kutim aswan allinqa.
The people there are great.	Chaypi runakunaqa hatunmi.
He came to talk to her.	Payqa hamurqa paywan rimananpaq.
I can't do this now.	Kunanqa manam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I am the current one.	Ñuqaqa kunan kaqmi kani.
I want to tell you more.	Astawan willayta munani.
I hope you’re not sick of me.	Suyachkani mana ñuqamanta unqusqa kasqaykita.
Lots and lots of things.	Achka achka imakuna.
It’s very bad here.	Kaypiqa ancha mana allinmi.
This should be done regularly.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwana.
I’m waiting for that.	Suyachkani chayta.
It’s not good anywhere.	Manan maypipas allinchu.
I’m afraid to talk.	Manchakuni rimayta.
But you’re somewhere.	Ichaqa maypipas kanki.
Why does it have to be anything else?.	¿Imanasqataq huk imapas kanan?.
He was very nearly a local celebrity afterwards.	Payqa ancha yaqa chay llaqtapi riqsisqa runam karqa chaymanta.
That may not be the best option.	Chayqa manapaschá aswan allinchu kanman.
He probably still is.	Payqa yaqapaschá kunankamapas kashan.
But not the same person, apparently.	Ichaqa manan kikin runachu, yaqapaschá.
He would want this for you.	Payqa kaytan qanpaq munanman.
And now came the challenge.	Hinaspa kunan hamurqan sasachakuy.
He seemed overwhelmed.	Payqa llumpay llakisqa hinam karqa.
In a difficult time.	Sasa tiempopi.
To talk about it.	Chaymanta rimananpaq.
A couple of nights.	Huk iskay tuta.
He wanted it to look familiar.	Payqa munarqa riqsisqa hina kananta.
He didn’t have much of a grip on it.	Payqa manan anchatachu chaymantaqa hap’isqa.
This would not have been a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman karqa.
That’s obviously not really true.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana cheqaq cheqaqchu.
The result was actually quite interesting.	Chay ruwasqanqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Now it seems sure to come.	Kunanqa seguro hinam hamunqa.
Everything about you is wrong here.	Tukuy imapas qammanta kaypiqa mana allinchu.
Everyone is busy with something.	Llapallankum imapipas ocupasqa kachkanku.
Maybe a lot of stuff like that.	Ichapas achka chayna imapas.
All right,’ he says.	Allinmi’, nispas nin.
That is what he began to say.	Chaynatam niyta qallaykurqa.
He wanted to get there.	Chayman chayayta munarqa.
Happy, that’s the big thing.	Kusisqa, chaymi hatun kaq.
That’s what it’s like to be happy.	Chayqa kusisqa kaymi.
Still, it didn't go well.	Chayna kaptinpas manam allintachu pasarqa.
We used to talk, that’s all.	Ñawpaqtaqa rimaq kayku, chaylla.
Better than nothing maybe, but .	Aswan allinmi mana imamantapas ichapas, ichaqa .
And you did it anyway.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas ruwarqanki.
If he is.	Sichus pay.
Don’t do anything else.	Amaña imatapas ruwaychu.
He didn’t know, he didn’t want to.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu, manan munarqanchu.
So, it should be important.	Chaymi, importante kanan.
There are not many.	Achka mana kanchu.
He had always been good.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi allin kasqa.
He said he was stupid.	Payqa nirqanmi sonso kashasqanmanta.
Nothing ever happened.	Manam imapas haykapipas karqachu.
It was crazy for sure.	Chayqa loco hinam karqa seguro.
It was a chance, always a chance.	Huk chansa karqa, sapa kuti chansa.
I can't do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atiymanchu manañam.
Be there first be there always.	Ñawpaqta chaypi kay sapa kuti chaypi kay.
So he was a real smart guy.	Chaymi payqa cheqaq yachaysapa runa karqan.
Or how many people.	Utaq hayka runakuna.
And you think with him.	Hinaspa paywan kuska yuyaykunki.
Everything would be like last year.	Tukuy imapas qayna wata hinam kanman.
So it’s a good thing.	Chaymi allin kachkan.
You are always angry.	Sapa kutim phiñasqa kanki.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi kasqa.
Where did it come from?	Maymantataq hamurqa.
He’s obviously very unwell.	Payqa sut’inmi ancha mana allinchu kashan.
I never thought something like this would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayna imapas pasananta.
Okay, they're not that good.	Allinmi, manam chayna allinchu kanku.
This was very surprising but not really bad.	Kayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa ichaqa manam chiqaptachu mana allinchu karqa.
He knows where you are.	Yachanmi maypi kasqaykita.
Something big, something .	Imapas hatun, imapas .
It just came up.	Chayraqmi hamurqa.
What's up, everybody.	Imataq kachkan, llapallanku.
That was a week ago.	Chayqa huk semana ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan.
There is so much that every person can do.	Ancha achkatam sapa runa ruwayta atin.
He's obviously a great player.	Payqa sut'inmi hatun pukllaq.
I said something wrong.	Imatapas mana allintam nirqani.
Maybe it’s early.	Ichapas temprano kanman.
But I’m just like you.	Ichaqa qan hinan kani.
He knew exactly what he needed.	Payqa allintan yacharqan ima necesitasqanmanta.
But I didn’t quite know how.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yacharqani imaynatachus chayta.
Obviously, this is not correct.	Sut’inmi, kayqa manan allinchu.
But we both did the same thing.	Ichaqa iskayninkum chayna hinata ruwarqayku.
Fortunately, it worked.	Ancha kusisqam chay ruwasqanqa allin karqa.
I just couldn’t talk about it.	Chaylla mana chaymanta rimayta atirqanichu.
It couldn’t have been very well otherwise.	Manan ancha allintachu huk hina kanman karqan.
I thought this turned out not too bad.	Yuyarqanim kayqa mana ancha mana allinchu lluqsirqa.
I can’t be that person.	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu.
Please, please.	Ama, ama hina kaspa.
I just thought of something.	Chayraqmi imatapas yuyaykurqani.
It didn't seem that good.	Manam chayna allinchu rikchakurqa.
He didn’t mean that.	Chaytaqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
I think he’s lonely.	Yuyaykuni sapallan kasqanmanta.
Why that would be, no one knows.	Imarayku chayna kananta, mana pipas yachanchu.
But that is not an easy task.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.
Who knew what was up with him.	Pitaq yacharqan imachus paymanta kashasqanmanta.
But I am well aware that this cannot be very safe.	Ichaqa allintam yachani kayqa manam ancha segurochu kanman.
Nothing else ever.	Mana imapas huk hayk’aqpas.
I’m sorry we didn’t do that.	Chayta mana ruwasqaykumanta llakikuni.
But that’s not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chay hinaqa.
I tried again last night.	Qayna tutam yapamanta kallpanchakurqani.
It’s harder to go wrong here.	Aswan sasa kaypi mana allinta riy.
What is the time.	Imataq chay pacha.
But he said it was very important.	Ichaqa ancha importante kasqanmantan nirqan.
For now, that’s what he should have done.	Kunankamaqa chaytan ruwanan karqan.
Very good indeed.	Ancha allinmi chiqaptapuni.
Who knows what that is.	Pitaq yachan imataq chay kasqanmanta.
Today was easy.	Kunan punchawqa facilmi karqa.
It wasn't so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu karqa.
So this is kind of a new thing.	Chaymi kayqa huk laya musuq kaq.
What did he really want from her.	Imatataq paymanta chiqaptapuni munarqa.
Then be happy.	Chaymanta kusisqa kay.
This is a chance thing.	Kayqa huk chansa kaqmi.
And there was someone.	Hinaspa pipas kasqa.
But, not always.	Ichaqa, manan sapa kutichu.
I think he’s great.	Payqa hatunmi nispan yuyaykuni.
He couldn't sleep for long.	Manam unaytachu puñuyta atinman karqa.
He was always in high school, you know.	Payqa sapa kutim colegiopi karqa, yachanki.
I am very happy indeed.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chiqaptapuni.
I didn’t want anyone to know.	Manam munarqanichu pipas chayta yachananta.
The most beautiful child in the world.	Kay pachapi aswan sumaq wawa.
It was a very tough time.	Chayqa ancha sinchi tiempon karqan.
We can never be together.	Manam haykapipas kuska kayta atichwanchu.
Really, it’s pretty cool.	Chiqamanta, ancha sumaq.
It was cold here.	Kaypiqa chiri karqa.
You’re not there, are you.	Manam chaypichu kachkanki, ¿aw.
That seems kind of silly.	Chayqa huk laya mana yuyayniyuq hinam.
He is a strong, strong man.	Payqa sinchi, sinchi runam.
Not sure really.	Mana segurochu chiqaptapuni.
Now that’s what he does.	Kunanqa chaytan ruwan.
I am not sure at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu kani.
It’s that time again .	Chay tiempon yapamanta .
He meant to say.	Paymi niyta munarqa.
If you think about it, all the better.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, aswan allinmi.
I feel very sad and angry.	Sinchi llakisqa, phiñasqa ima sientekuni.
That means two things.	Chayqa iskay imatapas niyta munan.
Such a good kid.	Chayna allin wawa.
And then tonight.	Hinaspa chaymanta kunan tuta.
I did something about it.	Ñuqaqa imatapas ruwarqani.
It was always me.	Sapa kutim ñuqa karqani.
I mean, thirty years.	Niyta munani, kimsa chunka wata.
I want to know the truth about myself.	Ñoqaqa ñoqamanta cheqaq kaqta yachayta munani.
I was half human.	Kuskan runam karqani.
There is a problem with that.	Chaywanmi huk sasachakuy kachkan.
It is very important that we do so.	Ancha allinmi chayta ruwananchik.
Or, maybe, like me you didn’t know about it.	Utaq, ichapas, ñuqa hina mana chaymanta yacharqankichu.
He looked really sick.	Payqa chiqap unqusqa hinam rikchakurqa.
She’s a mean girl.	Payqa millay sipasmi.
Great day indeed.	Hatun punchaw chiqap.
You said money.	Qanmi nirqanki qolqeta.
And they were honored that night.	Hinan chay tuta ancha allinpaq qhawarisqa karqanku.
Yes, that was better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
He drove there one night.	Huk tutan chayman carropi rirqan.
Here’s to three years.	Kaypi kimsa wata.
Someone has to be sensible.	Pipas yuyayniyuqmi kanan.
All there, but not there.	Tukuy chaypi, ichaqa mana chaypichu.
I didn’t know about it, sorry.	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu, pampachaykuway.
He wanted to do something with her.	Payqa imatapas paywan ruwayta munarqa.
I’m tired and frustrated.	Sayk’usqa, hukmanyasqa ima tarikuni.
Is it a good idea? 	¿Allinchu kanman?
Find out what’s in it.	Imakuna chaypi kasqanmanta yachay.
I still don’t understand everything.	Kunankamapas manam tukuy imatapas entiendenichu.
So no one knows.	Chaymi mana pipas yachanchu.
Like, really really just.	Imayna, chiqap chiqaptapuni chaylla.
I feel much better.	Aswan allinmi sientekuni.
I know this much is true.	Yachanim kay achka chiqap kasqanmanta.
He smoked a few cigarettes.	Payqa iskay kinsa cigarrota pitaq.
In fact, he was a bit better.	Aswanpas payqa huk chhikantan aswan allin karqan.
You know, really.	Yachanki, chiqap.
I hope he will always be recognized for it.	Suyachkani chaymanta sapa kuti riqsisqa kananta.
Then learn to ask questions.	Chaymanta tapuyta yachay.
Tom, however, did.	Tom ichaqa chayta ruwarqan.
I don’t know how all this will all work out.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus tukuy kay tukuy kanqa chayta.
I can’t ask you.	Manam tapuyta atiymanchu.
Like, bigger than that.	Imayna, aswan hatun.
He probably knows that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachan.
Go to school every day.	Sapa punchaw yachay wasiman riy.
There is no outside.	Manam kanchu hawapi.
It seems to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwanman hina.
I didn’t hear that.	Chaytaqa mana uyarirqanichu.
It was a very quick process.	Chayqa ancha utqaylla ruwaymi karqa.
Yeah, that’s it, three.	Arí, chayqa, kimsa.
After all, it’s not worth it.	Tukuy imamanta, mana valenchu.
That wasn’t true now.	Chayqa kunanqa manan cheqaqchu karqan.
They are safer.	Paykunaqa aswan segurom kanku.
That was a milestone.	Chayqa huk hatun ruwaymi karqa.
Probably, but not quite.	Yaqapaschá, ichaqa manan allintachu.
He wants to have a party.	Payqa fiestata ruwayta munan.
Can’t go with that.	Mana chaywan riyta atinchu.
This was not going to be a success.	Kayqa manam allin kananpaqchu karqa.
But now he is fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi kachkan.
It’s a difficult problem.	Sasa sasachakuy.
He is the greatest.	Paymi aswan hatun.
Next month's day.	Hamuq killa punchaw.
further.	aswan.
You are really beautiful.	Qamqa chiqap sumaqmi kanki.
It’s not like no one exists.	Manan mana pipas kanman hinachu.
We are not like yesterday.	Manam qayna punchaw hinachu kanchik.
I know it’s going to be bad.	Yachanim mana allin kananta.
Then I went for a weekend.	Chaymantam huk semana tukuyta rirqani.
He is right though.	Payqa allintam rimachkan ichaqa.
Preferably in the real world.	Aswan allinqa chiqap pachapi.
Everything had been wrong for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan tukuy imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
He sounds very happy to be here.	Payqa ancha kusisqam uyarikun kaypi kasqanmanta.
The sadder the better.	Aswan llakisqa kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Again doing a great job.	Yapamanta hatun llamkayta ruwaspa.
I wasn't so sure about it either.	Ñuqapas manam chaymantaqa chayna segurochu karqani.
Now he wasn’t sure at all.	Kunanqa manan imapipas segurochu kasqa.
Which is important.	Imataq importante.
Or ten years older.	Utaq chunka wata kuraq.
And, like, everybody.	Hinaspa, imayna, llapa runa.
Yes it is very good.	Arí ancha allinmi.
He wanted to talk to you.	Payqa qanwan rimayta munarqa.
But things won’t work out that easily.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas allin kanqa.
It couldn’t have been good, you knew.	Mana allinchu kanman karqan, chaytan yacharqanki.
He had no idea how good he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
So, what do you say.	Chaymi, imata niy.
Obviously, he’s had it plenty of times.	Sut’inmi, payqa askha kutitan hap’irqan.
He was, he was very much.	Payqa karqan, payqa anchatan karqan.
This man was a man like me.	Kay runaqa ñuqa hina runam karqa.
So that’s a good thing.	Chaymi chayqa allin kaq.
I know he doesn't know.	Yachanim mana yachanchu.
It turned out to be a terrible set up.	Chayqa manchay churasqa kasqanmantam lluqsirqa.
Meaning he never.	Niyta munan payqa mana hayk’aqpas.
You can’t play the game.	Manam pukllayta atiwaqchu.
These can be done by one or three people.	Chaykunataqa huk runa utaq kimsa runam ruwanman.
Everything seems fine here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
That was never going to be lonely.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu kanan karqan.
Who was who.	Pitaq pi karqa.
I think it’s him.	Paymi kasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
You are so beautiful.	Qamqa ancha sumaqmi kanki.
You don’t just do it.	Qamqa manam chayllachu ruwanki.
It’s good to be out there.	Allinmi chay hawapi kayqa.
I would be fine, but I can't do anything about it.	Ñuqaqa allinmi kayman, ichaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atinichu.
Make it faster.	Aswan utqaylla ruway.
Only I can fix this.	Ñuqallam kayta allichayta atiyman.
It’s okay now though.	Allinmi kunan ichaqa.
I don’t want to say anything bad about him.	Manam paymanta mana allinta rimayta munanichu.
I thought I would do the same.	Ñuqapas chaynata ruwanaypaqmi piensarqani.
He was happier alone.	Payqa sapallanmi aswan kusisqa karqan.
In fact, there was nothing.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas karqachu.
No one wants something like this to happen.	Manan pipas munanchu kay hina imapas pasananta.
I almost had no choice.	Yaqapaschá mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanichu.
I feel human again.	Hukmanta runa hinam tarikuni.
He looked nervous, although it was cold.	Payqa mancharisqa qhawarisqa, chiri kaptinpas.
This is what this is.	Kaymi kayqa.
The best part of everything.	Tukuy imamanta aswan allin kaq.
It looked nice, like home.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa, wasi hina.
He spent almost every afternoon there.	Chaypim yaqa sapa tarde pasarqa.
This will be your role.	Kaymi kanqa qampa ruwanayki.
More and more people want to be there.	Aswan achka runakunam chaypi kayta munanku.
If you want that short story, there you go.	Sichus chay pisi willakuyta munanki chayqa, chaypin kanki.
It was sad, it was devastating.	Llakikuypaqmi karqa, sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He's out there somewhere.	Payqa maypipas hawapi kachkan.
There was nothing better.	Manam aswan allinqa karqachu.
And then you do it.	Hinaspa chaymanta ruwanki.
He prefers to have what he wants.	Aswan allinmi munasqanman hina kananpaq.
It is safer.	Aswan segurom kachkan.
So handsome but tired.	Chaymi sumaq rikchayniyuq ichaqa sayk’usqa.
He held the door.	Payqa punkuta hap’irqan.
And, well, then he almost tried to stop her.	Hinaspa, allinmi, chaymantaqa yaqapaschá hark’ayta munarqan.
I wish it was me.	Munaymanmi ñuqa kananta.
He really wanted to do that.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chayta ruwayta.
He had, he thought, more of the day.	Payqa, payqa yuyaykurqanmi, aswan askha p’unchay kananpaq.
I’m not quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yachani imarayku.
It felt very familiar.	Chayqa ancha riqsisqa hinam tarikurqani.
Will he do it?.	¿Ruwanqachu?.
That was a huge success.	Chayqa hatun allin ruwaymi karqa.
I had it easy too.	Ñuqapas chaywanqa facilmi karqani.
A future with you.	Huk hamuq pacha qanwan.
But it would be faster.	Ichaqa aswan utqayllam kanman.
Otherwise, he would do nothing.	Mana chayqa manan imatapas ruwanmanchu.
Clearly, there was no new alternative.	Sut’inmi, manan huk mosoq huk ruwayqa karqanchu.
Better, perhaps, if he .	Aswan allinmi, ichapas, sichus payqa .
He didn’t seem too impressed.	Payqa manan ancha admirasqa hinachu karqan.
The first one was like that.	Ñawpaq kaqmi chayna hina karqa.
You don’t know what happened.	Mana yachankichu ima pasasqanmanta.
Maybe that someone is you.	Ichapas chay pipas qam kanman.
Better to know that now.	Aswan allinmi chayta kunan yachay.
In fact, they’re rather nice.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa aswan sumaqmi kanku.
That was a wonderful thing to do.	Chayqa ancha sumaq ruwaymi karqa.
No future there.	Mana hamuq pacha chaypi.
He went away.	Payqa rirqa.
I felt very happy and proud.	Ancha kusisqa hinaspa orgulloso tarikurqani.
That’s bad food really.	Chayqa mana allin mikhuy chiqap.
And that’s good for him.	Hinaspa chayqa allinmi paypaq.
Once, that was all.	Huk kutilla, chayllam karqan.
There is the truth there.	Chaypin kan cheqaq kaq.
But everything is easier.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas aswan facilmi.
Now tell me what just happened.	Kunanqa willaway imakuna chayllaraq pasasqanmanta.
He would have been like that.	Payqa chhayna kanman karqan.
It’s like learning a new language.	Musuq simita yachay hinam.
We are not ready.	Manam listochu kachkaniku.
I did it foolishly.	Mana yuyayniyuqmi chaytaqa ruwarqani.
He will have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan kanqa.
It all came out of there.	Tukuy chaymanta lluqsirqa.
He wanted to know about it.	Chaywanmi yachayta munarqa.
I don’t disagree with that.	Manam chaywanqa mana acuerdopichu kani.
I knew it was going to happen ahead of time.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqani chayna kananta.
He would be here if he could be.	Payqa kaypi kanman karqan sichus kayta atinman chayqa.
There had to be something more.	Aswan imapas kanan karqa.
However, that wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
And he’d like me to go with him.	Hinaspa payqa munanman paywan rinaypaq.
They were probably all drunk.	Yaqapaschá llapallanku machasqa karqanku.
A few days later he is in a hospital.	Iskay kinsa p’unchay qhepamanmi huk hospitalpi kashan.
He could have said it better, but it’s no big deal.	Aswan allinta rimayta atinman karqan, ichaqa manan hatun ruwaychu.
I’m just like me.	Ñuqaqa ñuqa hinallam kani.
I have seen them all the time.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutim rikurqani.
And it will in the future.	Hinaspa hamuq tiempopi ruwanqa.
I want to know the truth.	Cheqaq kaqta yachayta munani.
It didn't seem very good.	Mana ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
Everything looked very much the same as usual.	Tukuy imapas anchatam rikchakurqa sapa kuti hina.
You were a human being.	Runa karqanki.
He had to do something, say something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan, imatapas nisqa.
Easy to do.	Facil ruway.
This was more serious, perhaps.	Kayqa aswan hatunmi karqa, ichapas.
I couldn’t get to it.	Manam chayayta atirqanichu.
The people are very nice though.	Runakunaqa ancha sumaqmi ichaqa.
I don’t really want to talk about it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaymanta rimayta munani.
He was always a good guy in a crisis.	Payqa sapa kutim allin runa karqa sasachakuypi.
Nothing seemed right.	Manam imapas allinchu rikchakurqa.
He wants to hear it every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi uyariyta munan.
In fact, he knows nothing else.	Aswanpas payqa manan yachanchu huk ruwaykunata.
He craved time but he had to hurry.	Payqa tiempotan anchata munarqan ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
Maybe two years or so.	Ichapas iskay wata utaq chayna.
He sure was smart.	Payqa segurom karqa yachaysapa.
The man could not see.	Chay runaqa manam rikuyta atirqachu.
Great food, everything.	Hatun mikhuy, tukuy ima.
That could take a week.	Chaypaqqa huk semanan kanman.
Maybe this was a good thing.	Ichapas kayqa allin karqa.
It really should have been.	Chiqamanta chayna kanan karqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chaytaqa manam allinchu.
Sorry, it just happened.	Pampachaykuway, chayllaraqmi pasarqa.
It takes more time.	Aswan tiempotan necesitan.
Tell me about this.	Kaymanta willaway.
I want to be the first.	Ñawpaq kaq kaytam munani.
But this could be better.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
The villain did the right thing.	Chay mana allin ruwaq runaqa allinta ruwarqa.
I want to hear from him soon.	Paymanta usqhaylla uyariyta munani.
That would be obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi kanman.
Maybe it won’t do well.	Ichapas mana allintachu ruwanqa.
We are there for you.	Chaypim kachkaniku qampaq.
He seems fine otherwise.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun mana chayqa.
We’re better this way.	Kay hinaqa aswan allinmi kayku.
I couldn’t bear to leave.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu ripuyta.
The patient is well aware of this.	Unqusqa runaqa allintam yachan chayna kasqanmanta.
Can't imagine him.	Mana payta yuyaymanayta atinchu.
He wants to see her soon.	Payqa usqhayllan rikuyta munan.
I can do anything with it.	Chaywanmi imatapas ruwayman.
Everything is all good or all bad.	Tukuy imapas tukuy allinmi icha tukuy mana allinchu.
He was right to say no.	Payqa allintan nisqa mana nispa.
Nothing was funny anymore.	Manañam imapas asikunapaq hinachu karqa.
I barely heard anything all day.	Tukuy punchawmi yaqa mana imatapas uyarirqanichu.
It was a non-action.	Mana ruwaymi karqan.
One had thirty, the other twenty.	Hukninmi karqa kimsa chunka, huk iskay chunka.
A chance for someone new.	Pipas musuq kananpaq chansa.
I think that’s all.	Piensani chaylla.
You know, we’re very conscious of that.	Yachanki, chaymantaqa ancha yuyayniyuqmi kayku.
I don't want to see them yet.	Manaraqmi chaykunataqa qawayta munanichu.
The day would be his.	P’unchawqa paypaq kanman.
It was very cold there.	Chaypim llumpay chiri karqa.
No one doesn’t like it.	Manam pipas mana gustanchu.
Quickly do the right thing.	Utqaylla allin ruway.
I'm just, very tired.	Ñuqaqa chaylla, ancha sayk'usqa kachkani.
That’s what you were like.	Chaynatam karqanki.
We really need to do this, we need to do it.	Chiqamanta kayta ruwananchik tiyan, ruwananchik tiyan.
He does this quickly.	Chaytan usqhaylla ruwan.
Everyone wants to live in such a good city.	Lliwmi munanku chayna allin llaqtapi tiyayta.
Now it’s clearer.	Kunanqa aswan sut’inmi.
I always wanted to play again.	Sapa kutim hukmanta pukllayta munarqani.
You will do so very very well.	Chayna ancha ancha allintam ruwanki.
Here and .	Kaypi hinaspa .
He could never stay angry for very long.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha unayta phiñasqa qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
So seriously very long.	Chaymi serio ancha unayta.
This was supposed to be the best.	Kaymi aswan allinqa kanan karqa.
This is the first time.	Kaymi ñawpaq kutita.
Okay, here you go.	Allinmi, kaypi rinki.
It didn’t seem stupid at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan sonso hinachu karqan.
Nothing he did for me worked.	Manam imapas ñuqapaq ruwasqanqa allinchu karqa.
This was like last year.	Kayqa qayna wata hinam karqa.
That is the wrong thing to do.	Chayqa pantasqa ruwaymi.
I suspect he couldn’t handle the problem.	Sospechani chay sasachakuy mana atipayta atisqanmanta.
Someone who is more important.	Pipas aswan importante kaq.
But, not at all.	Ichaqa, manan imapipas.
Seriously, it does.	Serio, chayta ruwan.
It’s easy to see why that would be.	Facilmi yachay imanasqa chayna kananta.
He knew what she meant now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
However, that is not the case here.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu kaypiqa.
Might be busy for a while.	Ichapas huk tiempo ocupasqa kanman.
I’m not really happy.	Manam chiqaptachu kusisqa kachkani.
They want to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munanku.
Yes, he would have done that.	Arí, chaytan ruwanman karqan.
I saw her here last night.	Qayna tutam kaypi rikurqani.
He knows a lot about it.	Payqa anchatam chaymanta yachan.
If really great.	Sichus chiqap hatun.
Don’t do that please.	Ama chayta ruwaychu ama hina kaspa.
First something about you, maybe.	Ñawpaqtaqa imapas qammanta, ichapas.
I want to do something, but I don't know what.	Imatapas ruwayta munani, ichaqa manam yachanichu imata.
He was actually quite involved.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allintam chaypiqa karqa.
It was a strong head.	Sinchi uma kasqa.
The day passed quickly.	Chay punchawqa utqayllam pasarqa.
I didn’t mean all that.	Manam tukuy chaykunataqa niyta munarqanichu.
This was supposed to be good.	Kayqa allinmi kanan karqa.
If that’s the case.	Chayna kaq kaptinqa.
He probably could have.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa atinman karqan.
He wants to get out of here.	Payqa kaymanta lluqsiyta munan.
It was never going to be easy.	Manam haykapipas facilchu kanan karqa.
Maybe this is really him.	Ichapas kay chiqap pay kanman.
This approach makes sense.	Kay ruwayqa yuyayniyuqmi.
He was always right.	Payqa sapa kutim allinta rimaq.
And anyway, he's right.	Hinaspa imayna kaptinpas, payqa allintam rimachkan.
Wherever you want it.	Maypichus munanki.
Unfortunately, she said.	Llakikuypaqmi, payqa nirqa.
Tell someone something.	Pimanpas imatapas willay.
It means almost nothing.	Yaqa mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
This seemed to fit the bill.	Kayqa chayman hinam rikchakurqa.
No one is always bad.	Manan pipas sapa kutilla mana allinchu.
Can he, but he doesn’t want to? 	¿Atinmanchu, ichaqa mana munanchu?
But he soon faced a challenge.	Ichaqa chayllam huk sasachakuypi tarikurqa.
You are a bigger person.	Qamqa aswan hatun runam kanki.
It just happened that you don’t know.	Chayllaraqmi pasarqa mana yachasqaykita.
I could never be like that.	Manam haykapipas chayna kayta atiymanchu karqa.
I mean hungry.	Yarqaymanta niyta munani.
I can’t go outside.	Manam hawaman lluqsiyta atiymanchu.
Like, well.	Imayna, allinta.
He said many people are not.	Paymi nirqa achka runakuna mana chayna kasqankuta.
He did this often nowadays.	Chaytaqa kunan tiempopiqa sapa kutillanmi ruwaq.
He was a mentor, a mentor.	Payqa huk yachachiqmi karqan, huk yachachiqmi karqan.
There is a .	Chaypiqa kanmi.
I wasn’t there at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaypichu karqani.
No, it was a good one.	Manan, allinmi karqan.
He would have wanted to be like that.	Chayna kaytam munanman karqa.
One is very, very real.	Hukninmi ancha, ancha chiqap.
Wasn’t I at all.	Manachu ñuqaqa karqani ni imapipas.
If anyone is to blame it is him.	Sichus pipas huchayoq chayqa paymi.
He thought a lot about it.	Chaypin anchata yuyaykurqan.
Timing was important here.	Kaypiqa ancha allinmi karqa tiempo ruwayqa.
But he realized that it was better to do nothing.	Ichaqa repararqanmi mana imatapas ruway aswan allin kasqanta.
I couldn’t finish here.	Manam kaypiqa tukuyta atirqanichu.
But that would be the worst.	Ichaqa chaymi aswan mana allin kanman.
I hope it's true.	Suyachkani chiqap kasqanmanta.
Yes he will do it.	Arí paymi ruwanqa.
it wasn’t a good thing.	manam allinchu karqa.
I still wanted it.	Chaytaqa hinallam munarqani.
I 'm sorry	Pampachaykuway .
But that wouldn’t be a big deal.	Ichaqa chayqa manan hatun ruwaychu kanman.
He had no idea what this was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus kay kasqanmanta.
It will be very difficult.	Ancha sasa kanqa.
Nothing seemed real anymore.	Manañam imapas chiqap hinachu karqa.
I was there, all right.	Chaypim karqani, allinmi.
No one likes them.	Manan pipas chaykunataqa gustanchu.
He says you did too.	Payqa ninmi qampas chayta ruwasqaykita.
All good now.	Tukuy allin kunan.
So that’s the day.	Chaymi chay punchaw.
But that seemed unlikely.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
The people were hungry.	Chay runakunam yarqaymanta karqaku.
So it’s a very big deal.	Chaymi ancha hatun.
You know this makes no sense.	Yachanki kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
But most people were like that.	Ichaqa yaqa llapan runakunam chayna karqaku.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu imamanta.
I still want him to succeed.	Hinallam munani allinta ruwananta.
It just seemed stupid.	Chayqa sonso hinallam rikchakurqa.
In a city.	Huk llaqtapi.
Maybe he went to talk.	Ichapas payqa rimananpaq rirqa.
They are the latter.	Paykunaqa qhipa kaqmi kanku.
So it seemed.	Chaymi rikchakurqa.
I mean, he really was the guy.	Niyta munani, payqa chiqaptam chay runa karqa.
He was always so good.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna allin karqa.
I'm not so sure about this.	Manam chayna segurochu kani kaymanta.
I’ve always wanted to go.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi riyta anchata munarqani.
Okay, very much so.	Allinmi, ancha chayna.
And what it looks like.	Hinaspa imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
That's all, nothing.	Chayllam, manam imapas.
I mean, fast.	Niyta munani, utqaylla.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allintan ruwaq.
I’m afraid to imagine what would happen in another role.	Manchakuni huk ruwaypi imakuna pasananta yuyaymanayta.
It would be easier now.	Kunanqa aswan facilmi kanman.
Wouldn’t want to live here.	Mana kaypi tiyayta munanmanchu.
It was crazy crazy.	Chayqa loco loco karqan.
The action is there.	Chay ruwayqa chaypim kachkan.
He is not like that today.	Payqa kunan tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu.
Many people were injured.	Achka runakunam chayna k’irisqa karqaku.
I didn’t want to think like anyone else.	Manam huk runa hinachu yuyaymanayta munarqani.
Accordingly, he said nothing at all that morning.	Chayman hinaqa manan chay paqarin ni imapipas nirqanchu.
He won’t be around much longer.	Payqa manan aswan unaytachu chaypiqa kanqa.
They were really good to me.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam ñuqapaq allin karqaku.
There he came again.	Chaypim yapamanta hamurqa.
Can’t wait to see you there!.	¡Mana suyayta atiymanchu chaypi rikuyta!.
But you are a human being.	Ichaqa runan kanki.
That was the important thing.	Chayqa importante kaqmi karqan.
To be hidden.	Pakasqa kananpaq.
He says there is a present tense.	Kunan pacha kanmi nin.
I know how to think.	Yachanim yuyaymanayta.
All that black.	Tukuy chay yana.
She knew he would be proud of her.	Payqa yacharqanmi paymanta orgulloso kananta.
I didn’t do well, I mean.	Manam allintachu ruwarqani, niyta munani.
Some other time perhaps.	Wakin huk pacha ichapas.
I didn’t want to think about anything.	Manam imapipas yuyaymanayta munarqanichu.
Someone’s injured.	Pipas k’irisqa.
First, there’s a reason.	Ñawpaqtaqa, kanmi imarayku.
But today is the best day.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi aswan allinqa.
I would be fine if that were the case.	Allinmi kayman chayna kaptinqa.
It was so good that he bought it.	Ancha allinmi karqan chayta rantinanpaq.
And this is what happened.	Hinaspa kaymi pasarqa.
First of all, I .	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñuqa .
Perhaps he was disappointed.	Ichapas payqa hukmanyasqa karqa.
However, he opened it.	Ichaqa, kicharirqa.
You want to talk, talk.	Rimayta munanki, rimayta.
All the time, actually.	Tukuy tiempo, chiqaptaqa.
I really can’t say.	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atiymanchu.
Make a really big deal out of it.	Chiqap hatun ruwayta ruway chaymanta.
And, yes, that’s a good thing.	Hinaspa, arí, chayqa allinmi.
Maybe you’re the moon.	Ichapas killa kanki.
It was always going to be mine.	Sapa kutim ñuqapa kanan karqa.
It was a beautiful new day.	Sumaq musuq punchawmi karqa.
That should be an easy thing to do.	Chayqa facil ruwaymi kanan.
I wasn’t surprised at all.	Manam ni imapipas admirakurqanichu.
But we did the right thing.	Ichaqa allintan ruwarqayku.
He is a wonderful scholar.	Payqa sumaq yachaysapa runam.
In that case, mindfulness means something.	Chayna kaptinqa yuyayniyuq kayqa imapas niyta munan.
This is what the world needs.	Kaymi kay pachapi runakunaqa necesitan.
But, things are good.	Ichaqa, imapas allinmi.
He's doing the music tonight.	Payqa kunan tutam chay takiyta ruwachkan.
I think that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispaymi yuyaykuni.
I don’t know how he can do that.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta ruwayta atinman chayta.
I would do the same thing again.	Ñuqapas chaynatam yapamanta ruwayman.
I love eating lunch out there.	Chay hawapi almuerzota mikhuyta anchata munani.
The process was easy.	Chay ruwayqa facilmi karqan.
I can’t let that go.	Chaytaqa manam saqiyta atiymanchu.
He says he didn't know until now.	Kunankamaqa manam yacharqanichu nispam nin.
Tonight was such a night.	Kunan tutaqa chayna tutam karqa.
Maybe true, maybe not.	Ichapas chiqap, ichapas mana.
You need to repeat the process twice.	Chay ruwayta iskay kutita ruwanayki tiyan.
He was completely serious.	Payqa llapanpim serio karqa.
Tom went quickly.	Tomqa usqhayllan rirqan.
But, it will come soon.	Ichaqa, chaylla hamunqa.
They disagree with you.	Paykunaqa manan qanwan acuerdopichu kanku.
It sounds great there.	Chaypiqa ancha allinmi uyarikun.
But don’t overdo it.	Ichaqa ama llumpayta ruwaychu.
This does no one any good.	Kayqa manam pimanpas allintachu ruwan.
Not so easy to do.	Mana chayna facilchu ruwayqa.
If he does that.	Chayta ruwaptinqa.
But here it was good.	Ichaqa kaypiqa allinmi karqa.
He probably would have been as good as her.	Payqa yaqapaschá pay hina allin kanman karqan.
But he knew he could.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi atisqanmanta.
They are nowhere to be found.	Paykunaqa mana maypipas kachkanku.
That would be now.	Chayqa kunanmi kanman.
They want all of that.	Tukuy chaytam munanku.
There is certainly every reason to do so.	Cheqaqtapunin kan tukuy imarayku chayta ruwanapaq.
That’s going to be mine.	Chayqa ñuqapaq kanqa.
It acted quickly.	Chayqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwarqan.
I can't wait to work with you.	Manam suyayta atinichu qamwan llamkayta.
But what if not.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman mana.
I’m afraid of hunger.	Manchakuni yarqaymanta.
Most of the time, actually.	Yaqa llapanpim, chiqaptaqa.
One will, however.	Hukninmi ichaqa ruwanqa.
He knew he could do whatever he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqantapas ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I'd rather not talk about it.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaymanta rimayqa.
Something big non-human.	Imapas hatun mana runa.
And that makes it worse.	Hinaspa chaymi aswan mana allinta ruwan.
I have no idea what it looks like.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna kasqanmantaqa.
This was supposed to be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanan karqa.
He had to do everything right.	Payqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwanan karqa.
Looks good though.	Allinmi rikchakun ichaqa.
However, this is not true in all cases.	Ichaqa manan kayqa cheqaqchu tukuy imapipas.
I’d rather tell the truth.	Aswan allinmi kanman cheqaq kaqta rimayta.
And he wants to live in his own house.	Hinaspa kikin wasinpi tiyayta munan.
I am such a person.	Ñuqaqa chayna runam kani.
Something bigger.	Wakin imapas aswan hatun.
A child, of course.	Huk wawa, chiqap.
Or maybe twenty.	Utaq ichapas iskay chunka.
Maybe you don’t want that.	Ichapas chaytaqa mana munankichu.
Not like usual.	Mana sapa kuti hinachu.
Everyone was happy and excited.	Lliwmi kusisqa hinaspa kusisqa karqaku.
I want to know where it is.	Maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
So, it makes no sense.	Chaymi, mana imapaqpas valenchu.
Why why why why why.	Imaraykutaq imarayku imarayku imarayku.
I just wanted her to be happy.	Munaymanmi karqa kusisqa kananta.
However, it is not worth doing it again.	Ichaqa, manan valenchu ​​hukmanta ruwayqa.
I was not very happy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqani.
I thought it was taken very seriously.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinpaq hapisqa kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I never expected this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa suyarqanichu.
Better to say nothing right now.	Aswan allinmi kunanpacha mana imatapas niy.
No one could walk properly.	Manan pipas allinta puriyta atirqanchu.
This is a tremendous achievement.	Kayqa hatun hatun ruwaymi.
With him about many things.	Paywan achka imamantapas.
It says a lot about him.	Paymanta achkatam riman.
About two months.	Yaqa iskay killa.
This is the main house.	Kaymi hatun wasi.
He thought carefully about what he expected.	Payqa allintan yuyaykurqan imachus suyasqanmanta.
It was already here.	Ñam kaypi karqa.
It is bigger and bigger than that.	Chaymanta aswan hatunmi, aswan hatunmi.
I knew how to deal with them.	Chaykunataqa yacharqanim imayna allichayta.
He went quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan rirqan.
He is the first one.	Payqa ñawpaq kaqmi.
He had never been so happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina kusisqachu karqan.
But it was the first step.	Ichaqa ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi karqan.
I want to say things.	Imakunatapas niyta munani.
Both, actually.	Iskayninku, chiqaptaqa.
And he had to go.	Hinaspa rinan karqan.
He would do what he had to do.	Payqa imachus ruwananta ruwanman karqan.
But you certainly did.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqanki.
And he said something very interesting.	Hinaspa ancha sumaq kaqta nirqa.
He didn’t know he could understand.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu entiendeyta atinanmanta.
And you've done a great job here.	Hinaspa kaypi hatun llamk'ayta ruwarqanki.
He really had no choice.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
This, at least, was very interesting.	Kayqa, aswanpas, ancha sumaqmi karqan.
Most of the time you can't get away with it at all.	Yaqa llapanpim mana imapipas lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
Yes, there was something, after all.	Arí, imapas karqan, tukuy imamanta.
After all, it is known for.	Tukuy imamanta, chaywan riqsisqa kachkan.
That pretty much does it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwan.
Maybe one day, but not today.	Ichapas huk punchaw, ichaqa manam kunan punchawchu.
A big, big looking one.	Huk hatun, hatun rikchayniyuq.
More than anything else.	Aswan imapas kasqanmanta.
I still know why he was there.	Kunankamapas yachanim imanasqa chaypi kasqanmanta.
I need a car.	Carrota necesitasaq.
You know, that one.	Yachanki, chay huknin.
If nothing else, that's bad.	Mana imapas kaptinqa, chayqa mana allinmi.
Instead, they want to support it.	Aswanpas chayta yanapayta munanku.
I can't really figure out what the problem is.	Manam chiqaptachu yuyaymanayta atiyman ima sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
It’s really great this year, actually.	Chiqamanta ancha sumaq kay wata, chiqamanta.
But he is alone.	Ichaqa payqa sapallanmi.
I'm sure you will too.	Seguro kani qampas chayta ruwanaykipaq.
The first step is easy.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwayqa facilmi.
Maybe you know that.	Ichapas chayta yachanki.
I think it wasn’t enough.	Yuyaykuni manan chayllachu karqan.
I don’t know if you can help, but .	Mana yachanichu yanapayta atisqaykita, ichaqa .
He couldn’t study or sleep.	Payqa manan estudiayta atirqanchu nitaq puñuyta atirqanchu.
So, today was that day.	Chaymi, kunan punchaw chay punchaw karqa.
I think maybe.	Yuyaykuni ichapas.
Last night, you know.	Qhipa tuta, yachanki.
I look forward to traveling further.	Astawan puriyta suyachkani.
Most certainly I didn't.	Aswan chiqaptaqa manam ruwarqanichu.
I can’t imagine why.	Manam yuyaymanayta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That is certainly not true.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana cheqaqchu.
I want things.	Imakunatapas munani.
It’s as easy as this.	Kay hina facil.
I know it doesn't exist.	Yachanim mana kasqanmanta.
It didn't make much sense at all.	Manam ancha yuyayniyuqchu karqa ni imapipas.
He told me he would be there.	Payqa chaypi kananta niwarqa.
So I don’t like him.	Chaymi payqa mana gustawanchu.
Everyone was so excited.	Lliwmi llumpayta kusisqa karqaku.
Again, that makes sense.	Yapamanta, chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi.
One is the best.	Hukninmi aswan allin kaq.
Be happy with it.	Chaywan kusisqa kay.
He continued to be very popular.	Payqa hinallam ancha riqsisqa karqa.
They know you’re alone here.	Paykunaqa yachanku sapallayki kaypi kasqaykita.
He is a great man and teacher.	Payqa hatun runam, yachachiqmi.
An hour is good, a day is better.	Huk hora allinmi, huk punchawmi aswan allin.
That means nothing is that simple.	Chayqa niyta munan manan imapas chay hina facilchu kasqanmanta.
So he couldn’t sleep.	Chayraykum mana puñuyta atirqachu.
I really can't imagine that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa yuyaymanayta atinichu.
In the past, anyway.	Ñawpaqpi, imayna kaptinpas.
This is a real practice.	Kayqa chiqap ruwaymi.
He was later dismissed.	Qhepamanmi qarqosqa karqan.
They seemed very tired, both of them.	Paykunaqa ancha sayk’usqa hinan karqanku, iskayninku.
Nowhere, everywhere.	Mana maypipas, sapa maypipas.
Most people are good.	Yaqa llapa runakunam allin kanku.
But then again, that’s not true.	Ichaqa chaymanta yapamanta, chayqa manan cheqaqchu.
Black as you are.	Qam hina yana.
It’s the latter.	Qhepa kaqmi.
I’m the one who’s yours.	Ñuqam qampaq kaq kani.
It’s bigger for me.	Aswan hatunmi ñuqapaq.
Now he looked like a child.	Kunanqa wawa hinam rikchakurqa.
This is going to be difficult.	Kayqa sasa kanqa.
He wanted a serious true answer.	Payqa munarqanmi serio cheqaq kutichiyta.
In fact, more like half a day.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan kuskan punchaw hina.
You are very pathetic.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi kanki.
I didn’t mean to fail.	Manam mana allintachu ruwayta munarqani.
It is difficult to do what is right.	Allin ruwayqa sasam.
He is a well-known figure in the community.	Payqa chay llaqtapi riqsisqa runam.
Now I know it.	Kunanqa yachanim.
It will take a couple of days.	Huk iskay punchawmi kanqa.
But that’s the house.	Ichaqa chaymi wasi.
Seriously, say what you want.	Serio, ima munasqaykita niy.
He’s a very tough player.	Payqa ancha sinchi pukllaqmi.
You know, .	Yachankim, .
Twice last week.	Iskay kutita qayna semana.
Ten times better.	Chunka kuti aswan allinmi.
The hard part is what happens next.	Sasa kaqmi chaymanta imakuna pasasqanmanta.
And then he had an interesting idea.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk sumaq yuyayniyuq karqan.
He’s the worst here.	Payqa aswan mana allinmi kaypi.
But, that means more work, and more money.	Ichaqa, chaymi niyta munan aswan llamkayta, hinaspa aswan qullqita.
However, it is important not to overstate the problem.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi chay sasachakuymanta mana llumpayta rimayqa.
He was a year and a half younger than me.	Payqa huk wata kuskan sullk’a karqan ñoqamanta.
That was two years.	Chayqa iskay wata karqa.
I see no reason not to do it.	Manam imaraykupas rikunichu mana ruwanaypaqqa.
Someone says something, something.	Pipas imatapas, imatapas nin.
If you know why something is wrong.	Sichus yachanki imarayku imapas mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
You’re a very good guy.	Qamqa ancha allinmi.
Always go the highway.	Tukuy pacha hatun ñanta riy.
This man should never have done that.	Kay runaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwananchu karqan.
Perhaps you have done so at one time.	Ichapas huk kutipi chayta ruwarqanki.
If you want it, it will surely happen.	Sichus munanki chayqa, cheqaqtapunin kanqa.
I didn’t want to be here anymore.	Manañam kaypi kayta munarqanichu.
He is available all day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi kachkan.
We are very happy tonight.	Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku kunan tuta.
He was like himself again.	Payqa yapamanta kikin hinam karqa.
Who wants to play tomorrow?.	¿Pitaq paqarin pukllayta munan?.
This is going to be a good one!.	¡Kayqa allinmi kanqa!.
It's always someone or something.	Sapa kutim pipas utaq imapas.
But there is a third step.	Ichaqa kinsa kaq ruwaymi kan.
He was a treasure.	Payqa qhapaq kaymi karqan.
He was an adult, after all.	Payqa kuraq runan karqan, tukuy imamanta.
I hadn’t thought of it that way before.	Manam ñawpaqtaqa chaynataqa piensarqanichu.
He was very sure of it.	Payqa anchatan chaymanta seguro kasharqan.
You were the second one.	Qanmi iskay kaq karqanki.
I have as much to do as anyone.	Pipas hinam achka ruwanay kachkan.
I really wanted to be someone else.	Huk runa kaytam anchata munarqani.
These people are out there.	Kay runakunaqa hawapi kachkanku.
No one would do it now.	Kunanqa manan pipas ruwanmanchu.
I don't care why and why not.	Manam imananpaschu imarayku hinaspa imarayku mana kasqanmantaqa.
He would be very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I haven't been here for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñam mana kaypichu kachkani.
There was none of this stuff before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam kay imapas karqachu.
I didn’t want to see it that way.	Manam chaynatachu qawayta munarqani.
This approach, however, tended to fail.	Kay ruwaymi ichaqa mana allintachu ruwayta munarqa.
You don’t know who they are.	Manan yachankichu pikuna kasqankuta.
He seems to do this every day of the week.	Semanapi sapa punchaw kayta ruwanman hinam.
If it’s easier for you.	Sichus aswan facil qanpaq.
This requires what everyone can do.	Chaypaqqa llapa runa ima ruway atisqanman hinan ruwana.
They always know.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim yachanku.
It couldn't have been better.	Manam aswan allinchu kanman karqa.
For that matter probably not.	Chaypaqqa yaqapaschá mana.
For him, as her, about him.	Paypaq, pay hina, paymanta.
It wasn't that bad, really.	Manam chayna mana allinchu karqa, chiqaptaqa.
You are a good person after all.	Qamqa tukuy imamanta allin runam kanki.
I did this twice a day or so.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi iskay kutita utaq chaynata ruwaq kani.
Be with him and be with him.	Paywan kuska kay.
Nothing to do here.	Mana imatapas kaypi ruwanapaq.
Like tonight.	Kunan tuta hina.
If that would be appropriate.	Sichus chay allin kanman chayqa.
But he did not do what he wanted to do.	Ichaqa manan munasqanman hinachu ruwarqan.
It was a pretty nice day.	Allin sumaq punchawmi karqa.
At least this doesn’t matter.	Aswanpas kayqa manan imananpaschu.
So he does something.	Chaymi imatapas ruwan.
He was not comfortable with it.	Payqa manan allinchu kasharqan chaywanqa.
This is the right thing to do.	Kaymi allin kaq.
This guy is great.	Kay runaqa hatunmi.
But he is really worried.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kashan.
You’re probably angry.	Yaqapaschá phiñasqa kashanki.
He didn't do much good with it.	Chaywanqa manam ancha allintachu ruwarqa.
That was a half-truth.	Chayqa kuskan cheqaq kaqmi karqan.
Instead, he seemed annoyed.	Aswanpas payqa phiñasqa hinan karqan.
I know it's not good yet.	Yachanim manaraq allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe the ??? 	Ichapas chay ???
But it was better than nothing.	Ichaqa mana imamantapas aswan allinmi karqa.
He was kind of hungry.	Payqa huk laya yarqaymanta kasqa.
It felt like a second home.	Iskay kaq wasi hinam tarikurqa.
All of this is obvious.	Tukuy kaykunaqa sut’inmi.
This is the time to do that.	Kaymi chayta ruwanapaq tiempo.
He didn’t know where he would be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kananta.
He talks a lot about it.	Chaymantaqa anchatam riman.
I feel angry this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi phiñasqa tarikuni.
I'm pretty sure it is.	Yaqa segurom kani chayna kasqanmanta.
Maybe too happy.	Ichapas ancha kusisqa.
In fact, the truth is worse.	Aswanpas cheqaq kaqmi aswan mana allinqa.
You have done wonderful things with it.	Chaywanmi sumaq ruwaykunata ruwarqanki.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
I hadn’t thought of this.	Kaytaqa manam yuyaykurqanichu.
Needless to say, that didn't happen.	Manañam niyta munanichu chayna mana pasasqanmanta.
It sounds right away.	Chayllam uyarikun.
It doesn’t do anything like that.	Manam imatapas chaynataqa ruwanchu.
That mindset was the first step.	Chay yuyayniyuq kaymi ñawpaq kaq ruway karqa.
He couldn't be without it.	Mana chaywanqa manam kayta atirqachu.
I can’t say the last word.	Qhepa simitaqa manan niyta atiymanchu.
But it was later.	Ichaqa qhepamanmi karqan.
He wants to study it.	Chayta estudiayta munan.
First and foremost.	Ñawpaq kaq hinaspa aswan riqsisqa.
I’m afraid you can.	Manchakuni atisqaykita.
He would like this.	Payqa kayta munanman.
It would be nice to talk to him.	Allinmi kanman paywan rimayqa.
This is the kind of person he was.	Kay hina runan karqan.
But this is a terrible day.	Ichaqa kay p'unchawqa manchay p'unchawmi.
Anything if anything, was wrong.	Imapas sichus karqan chayqa, manan allinchu karqan.
I have no idea what this is.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
It all means well.	Lliwmi allinta niyta munan.
And he loved that.	Hinaspa chaytaqa anchatan munarqan.
That person should be fired.	Chay runaqa qarqusqa kanan tiyan.
I really want to find that.	Chaytaqa anchatam tariyta munani.
He longed to see her again.	Payqa anchatan munarqan hukmanta rikuyta.
Head house.	Uma wasi.
And he would do it.	Hinaspa payqa ruwanman.
One is as bad as the other.	Hukninmi huknin hina mana allin.
In fact, it hardly exists.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá mana kanchu.
No, it’s a very big deal.	Manan, ancha hatun ruwaymi.
Go over it again and again.	Chayta yapamanta yapamanta riy.
But I can’t find one.	Ichaqa manan hukta tariyta atinichu.
But, he was the best.	Ichaqa, paymi aswan allin karqan.
This is a great one!.	¡Kayqa hatunmi!.
I have a lot of good ideas.	Achka allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
I didn't think he would.	Manam piensarqanichu chayta ruwananta.
Hopefully not always.	Munaymanmi mana sapa kutichu.
The man was a fool.	Chay runaqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kasqa.
One does not exist without the other.	Huknin mana huknin kaptinqa manam kanchu.
Nothing here, nothing there.	Mana imapas kaypi, mana imapas chaypi.
He died soon after.	Chay qhepamanmi usqhaylla wañupurqan.
He said he did it all the time.	Payqa nirqam sapa kuti chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I prefer the easy way out.	Aswan allinmi chay facil ñanta.
There are people who are scared.	Kanmi mancharisqa runakuna.
It will certainly be good to be home.	Cheqaqtapunin allin kanqa wasipi kayqa.
I wanted to be one.	Huk kaytam munarqani.
One for you.	Huknin qampaq.
If so, it is alone.	Chayna kaptinqa, sapallanmi.
But that's all they are.	Ichaqa chayllam paykunaqa kanku.
This is very important today.	Kayqa kunan tiempopiqa ancha allinmi.
I really need to hurry here.	Chiqamanta kaypi usqhaylla ruwanay tiyan.
He was there, but he wasn't.	Payqa chaypim karqa, ichaqa manam karqachu.
But you always look beautiful.	Ichaqa sapa kutim sumaq rikchayniyuq kanki.
Unfortunately, there wasn't.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam karqachu.
You probably don’t want that.	Manachá chaytachu munanki.
You do it like in school.	Yachay wasipi hinam ruwanki.
Nothing but blackness.	Mana imapas aswanpas yana kaymi.
Now or	Kunanqa icha .
I'm not sure it matters that much.	Manam segurochu kani chayna ancha importante kasqanmantaqa.
In the last week.	Qhipa semanapi.
That’s a pretty big deal you know.	Chayqa ancha hatun ruwaymi yachanki.
Very, very important.	Ancha, ancha importante.
That’s the type of person.	Chayqa chay laya runa.
Maybe he’s surprised.	Ichapas payqa admirasqa kachkan.
That didn’t work out.	Chayqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
Maybe it’s okay.	Ichapas allin kachkan.
There is no better way of saying it.	Manan aswan allin rimayqa kanchu.
I think it's a good challenge.	Allin sasachakuy kasqanmantam piensani.
I was proud of myself.	Orgulloso karqani.
This all depends on what it is.	Kay tukuy imapas ima kasqanmantam kanqa.
well, that's it.	allin, chaymi.
But there are several things you can do.	Ichaqa kanmi askha ruwaykunata ruwanaykipaq.
Not quite the first one.	Mana allintachu ñawpaq kaq.
This is really really nice.	Kayqa chiqap chiqap sumaqmi.
The important thing is that he did.	Importante kaqmi, paymi chayta ruwarqa.
I’m not always hungry anymore.	Manañan sapa kutichu yarqasqa kani.
I did this for the second time tonight.	Kayta iskay kaq kutita kunan tuta ruwarqani.
This is already there.	Kayqa ñam kachkan.
Very big for you.	Ancha hatun qampaq.
He can't do anything.	Payqa manam imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
I can't take that.	Manam chaytaqa hapiyta atiymanchu.
Here he wants to be more present.	Kaypiqa aswan chaypi kaytam munan.
Or, well, first of all.	Utaq, allinmi, ñawpaqtaqa.
He is not the man he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaqpi kaq runachu.
But he knew he didn't like it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana gustasqanmanta.
It would actually make the job easier.	Chiqamanta chaywanqa chay llamk’ayta aswan facil kanman.
I always knew that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim yacharqani.
I don't know how to find it again.	Manam yachanichu imaynata hukmanta tariyta.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayqa chayna kaqmi.
Someone to talk to him.	Pipas paywan rimananpaq.
Most of the time, nothing.	Yaqa llapanpim mana imapas.
It really is the worst.	Chiqaptam aswan mana allinqa.
The pedestrian is very seriously injured.	Chay puriq runaqa ancha sinchitan k’irisqa kashan.
He always wanted to hear it.	Payqa sapa kutim uyariyta munarqa.
He was supposed to be a good guy.	Payqa allin runam kanan karqa.
But now, it’s getting worse by the day.	Ichaqa kunanqa, sapa p’unchaymi manaña allinchu kashan.
No human being can do that.	Manan pipas runaqa chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
He refused and she was happy.	Payqa manan munarqanchu hinan payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
It happened yesterday.	Kayna punchawmi pasarqa.
Maybe you did really well there.	Ichapas chaypi chiqap allinta ruwarqanki.
Maybe two days.	Ichapas iskay punchaw.
And here it was again.	Hinaspa kaypi yapamanta karqan.
More for me, less for him.	Aswan ñuqapaq, aswan pisi paypaq.
Here’s the best part.	Kaypi aswan allin kaq.
This is nice, but not really that good.	Sumaqmi kayqa, ichaqa manam chiqaptaqa chayna allinchu.
There is nothing yet.	Manaraqmi imapas kanchu.
The last one is everyone.	Qhipa kaqmi llapa runa.
I may not be able to drive.	Manapaschá carrota manejayta atisaqchu.
This is good, this is great.	Kayqa allinmi, kayqa ancha allinmi.
I never find anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas tarinichu.
Don’t care if no one says so.	Ama imananpaschu mana pipas nisqanqa.
And it’s so good.	Hinaspa chayna allin.
There is nothing at all.	Manam kanchu ni imapipas.
I wanted to do something.	Ñuqaqa imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
I never know what to say or anything.	Manam haykapipas yachanichu ima niyta nitaq imatapas.
Let me know in good time, please.	Allin tiempopi willaway, ama hina kaspa.
I said no, thank you.	Manam, gracias nispaymi nirqani.
This is a very exciting one.	Kayqa ancha kusisqam.
They know you’re not good enough.	Paykunaqa yachanku mana allinchu kasqaykita.
The new front.	Musuq ñawpaq.
He cannot ignore them.	Chaykunataqa manan mana uyariyta atinmanchu.
And here it is.	Hinaspa kaypi.
Tell me a little truth.	Huk chikan chiqap kaqta willaway.
You wouldn’t want to do the wrong thing.	Manam mana allin kaqta ruwayta munawaqchu.
Very, very, very scared.	Ancha, ancha, ancha mancharisqa.
But it wasn’t anyone else.	Ichaqa manan huk runachu karqan.
So do it again.	Chaymi yapamanta ruway.

You either have it or you don’t.	Qamqa kanmi icha mana.
No, at least not always.	Manan, aswanpas mana sapa kutichu.
He immediately knew how to cope.	Chayllam payqa yacharqa imayna aguantayta.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen.	Yacharqanim mana kananta.
She is a beautiful girl indeed.	Payqa sumaq sipasmi chiqaptapuni.
I didn’t want to.	Mana munarqanichu.
I can leave a message.	Huk willakuyta saqiyta atiyman.
But that’s what I was.	Ichaqa chaymi ñoqaqa karqani.
There is no child.	Manam wawa kanchu.
But there was no time to do everything.	Ichaqa manan tiempo karqanchu tukuy imata ruwanapaq.
I want a lot of it.	Ñuqaqa munani achkata.
That’s the way it is.	Chayqa chayna.
I soon did that.	Pisi tiempollamantan chayta ruwarqani.
No injuries, nothing.	Mana k’irisqa, mana ima.
Too many people, too much privacy.	Achka runakuna, llumpay pakasqa kananpaq.
You can’t do mine.	Manam ñuqapa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I want to get out of this mess.	Kay sasachakuymanta lluqsiyta munani.
Something was extremely serious.	Imapas sinchi hatunmi karqa.
But that is a good statement.	Ichaqa chay rimayqa allinmi.
Everyone wants to come.	Lliwmi hamuyta munanku.
People, at least.	Runakuna, aswan pisi.
He was here, all right.	Payqa kaypim karqa, allinmi.
He can't know anything.	Payqa manam imatapas yachayta atinchu.
He didn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwarqa.
He thought it wasn’t for him.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi paypaq mana kasqanmanta.
You think about it all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi yuyaykunki.
I didn’t want to know about it.	Manam chaymanta yachayta munarqanichu.
I can’t tell you how bad it was.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
Tell me that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allin kasqanmanta willaway.
I’m rather angry.	Ñuqaqa aswan phiñasqa kachkani.
I can’t imagine what it would be like.	Manam yuyaymanayta atinichu imayna kananta.
I was disappointed that morning.	Chay paqarinmi hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
Everything about it was great.	Tukuy imapas chaypi kaqmi ancha allin karqa.
Hours ago.	Hora ñawpaqta.
Ten years later.	Chunka wata chaymanta.
But he didn’t pay much attention to it.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu chaytaqa qhawarirqan.
He couldn’t and couldn’t.	Payqa manan atirqanchu nitaq atirqanchu.
This was stupid anyway.	Kayqa imayna kaptinpas sonso kaymi karqa.
He wanted to be evil.	Payqa millay kaytam munarqa.
But he is never alone.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu.
How was everything.	Imaynataq tukuy imapas karqa.
I want to be him every day.	Sapa punchawmi pay kayta munani.
She looked up, worried.	Payqa qhawarisqa, llakisqa.
I probably don’t really need it.	Manachá chiqaptaqa necesitasaqchu.
Did that make any sense.	¿Chayqa imapaqpas allinchu karqa.
Someone was in the house.	Pipas chay wasipi kasqa.
It's not if, it's when.	Manam sichus, chayqa hayk'aqmi.
He was more of his own man.	Payqa aswan kikin runan karqan.
He wanted to be alone with her.	Payqa sapallanmi paywan kayta munarqa.
I have to be here, of course.	Kaypi kanay tiyan, chiqamanta.
He couldn't stay here, he knew that now.	Payqa manan kaypi qhepakuyta atirqanchu, chaytan kunanqa yacharqan.
You go home every night.	Sapa tutan wasiykiman rinki.
I saw that yesterday.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi rikurqani.
He couldn’t resist that.	Chaytaqa manan hark’ayta atirqanchu.
You’re hungry all the time.	Tukuy tiempo yarqasqa kanki.
And this is what worked.	Hinaspa kaymi allinta ruwarqa.
Maybe I was, too.	Ichapas ñuqapas karqani.
You know, they're not good.	Yachanki, manam allinchu kanku.
So, you know.	Chaymi, yachanki.
It seemed like no big deal.	Mana hatun ruway hinam karqa.
But he was right there.	Ichaqa allintan chaypi kasharqan.
That was quite amazing indeed.	Chayqa ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa chiqaptapuni.
He still doesn't have time.	Kunankamapas manam tiempon kanchu.
Of course, of course, it is.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, kachkan.
This was amazing!.	¡Kayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa!.
Married, but never.	Casarasqa, ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas.
It wouldn’t be the same as it was back then.	Manan chay tiempopi hinachu kanman.
It was ready for anything.	Imapaqpas listo kaymi karqa.
I’m busy, you’re busy.	Ñuqaqa ocupasqa kachkani, qamqa ocupasqa kachkanki.
This one very confused person.	Kay huk ancha pantasqa runa.
I know this is tough.	Yachanim kayqa sinchi sasa kasqanmanta.
It’s so nice!.	¡Ancha sumaqmi!.
I mean, they were good.	Niyta munani, paykunaqa allinmi karqanku.
And what to do.	Hinaspa imatataq ruwana.
I thought he was a good guy.	Allin runa kananpaqmi piensarqani.
I can't remember his name at the moment.	Mana kunan pacha sutinta yuyariyta atinichu.
I couldn’t stay with you anymore.	Manañan qanwan qhepakuyta atirqanichu.
I am very proud of what we have accomplished.	Anchatam orgulloso kani ima ruwasqaykumanta.
If he ever knew anything, he knows it now.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas imatapas yacharqan chayqa, kunanmi yachan.
He said it was great.	Paymi nirqa ancha allin kasqanmanta.
I almost feel married.	Yaqapaschá casarasqa hina sientekuni.
Maybe not after that.	Ichapas mana chaymantaqa.
This means you are fine.	Kayqa niyta munan allin kasqaykita.
And what will be, will be.	Hinaspa imachus kanqa, kanqa.
If you don’t want to, don’t be famous.	Mana munaspaqa ama riqsisqa kaychu.
The man was obviously smart.	Chay runaqa sut’inmi yachaysapa kasqa.
You said it was wrong.	Mana allin kasqanmantam nirqanki.
But it would be nice to do that, sure.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman chayta ruway, seguro.
Now, it’s the front head.	Kunanqa, ñawpaq uma kachkan.
Do it for yourself.	Ruway qampaq.
It wouldn’t have been that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
After all, you’re new here.	Tukuy imamanta, kaypi musuq kanki.
But you know this.	Ichaqa kaytan yachanki.
How should I do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwanay.
No one does anything right anymore.	Manañam pipas imatapas allintachu ruwan.
It’s good to be alone.	Allinmi sapallan kay.
Something like two and a half hours.	Iskay hora kuskan hina imapas.
I want to see that.	Chayta qawayta munani.
Anything for anything.	Imapaqpas imapas.
He probably did that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá ruwarqan.
That is, that's all it means.	Chayqa, chayllam niyta munan.
Thirty years passed.	Kimsa chunka wata pasarqa.
It’s like yesterday.	Qayna punchaw hinam.
Don’t be foolish now.	Ama kunanqa mana yuyayniyuq kaychu.
Two days, maybe three .	Iskay punchaw, ichapas kimsa .
I know that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yachani.
In most cases, this approach works.	Yaqa llapanpim kay ruwayqa allinpaq.
What happened, anyway.	Imataq pasarqa, imayna kaptinpas.
One day he received a letter from her.	Huk punchawmi paymanta huk cartata hamurqa.
This whole thing is ridiculous.	Kay tukuy imapas asikunapaq hinam.
I have to make a permit.	Permisota ruwanay tiyan.
Never mind this bad.	Ama hayk’aqpas kay mana allinqa.
Maybe the next one is for you.	Ichapas qatiqnin hukninmi qampaq.
He wants to be older.	Payqa kuraq kaytam munan.
One of the best guys.	Huknin allin runa.
But at least he knew they were together.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá payqa yacharqan kuska kasqankuta.
Yes, he was scared.	Arí, mancharisqa kasqa.
I always know something pretty good and sensible.	Sapa kutim yachani imapas allin allin hinaspa allin yuyayniyuq kaqta.
And always hungry.	Hinaspa sapa kuti yarqasqa.
Nothing seemed to go right.	Manas imapas allintachu puriq hina karqa.
We are not happy.	Manam kusisqachu kachkaniku.
He was kind of the new me.	Payqa huk laya musuq ñuqam karqa.
And that was pretty much it.	Hinaspa chayqa yaqa chayna karqa.
But it’s not really true.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu cheqaq.
Things were better than this.	Kaymantaqa imapas aswan allinmi karqa.
If something isn’t right now, it’s not right ever.	Sichus kunan imapas mana allinchu chayqa, manan allinchu hayk’aqpas.
I feel worse if you don't.	Aswan mana allintam sientekuni mana chayta ruwaptikiqa.
Tonight will go well.	Kunan tutaqa allintam rinqa.
That is not true.	Chay hinaqa manan cheqaqchu.
I wouldn’t do that either.	Ñoqapas manan chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
That was very shallow.	Chayqa ancha mana ancha hatunmi karqa.
But there was something very strange about it.	Ichaqa chaypiqa imapas ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa.
But he didn't have to do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan chaymantaqa imatapas ruwananchu karqan.
He knows he needs to do better.	Payqa yachanmi aswan allinta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
Caught in the act.	Chay ruwaypi hap’isqa.
Perhaps that seemed innocent enough.	Yaqapaschá chayqa mana huchayoq hinachu karqan.
I’m there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi kachkani.
She couldn’t be nicer.	Payqa manan aswan sumaq kayta atirqanchu.
He didn’t always get it.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa chaskirqan.
Now he was glad he hadn't.	Kunanqa kusisqa kasharqan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That’s the great thing about him.	Chayqa paymanta hatun kaqmi.
I don’t know anyone there.	Chaypiqa manam pitapas riqsinichu.
I don’t want to ask.	Manam tapuyta munanichu.
Yes, it wasn’t a good thing.	Arí, mana allinchu karqan.
He is not like other people.	Payqa manan wakin runakuna hinachu.
It still wasn't that easy.	Hinallam mana chayna facilchu karqa.
Yeah, that’s me.	Arí, chayqa ñuqam kani.
I never like that.	Chayqa manam haykapipas gustanchu.
Humanity needs to be better.	Runa kayqa aswan allinmi kanan.
You probably knew exactly what it was.	Yaqapaschá allinta yacharqanki ima kasqanmanta.
Tough to do.	Sinchi ruwanapaq.
You might want to leave that out.	Chaytaqa ichapas saqiyta munanki.
I know they are important.	Yachanim importante kasqankuta.
I won’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwasaqchu.
Here, where the night knows.	Kaypi, maypi tuta yachan.
I know what those people are like.	Yachanim chay runakuna imayna kasqankuta.
Everything is laid out as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam churasqa kachkan.
I'm not so sure that's the right thing to do.	Manam chayna segurochu kani chay allin ruway kasqanmanta.
No one stayed that long.	Manan pipas chay unaytachu qhepakurqan.
Now this is the next best thing.	Kunanqa kaymi qatiqnin aswan allin kaq.
I thought you might as well.	Yuyarqanim qampas kanman nispa.
Perhaps he tried to do so, but he could not.	Ichapas chayta ruwayta munarqa, ichaqa manam atirqachu.
So, probably not.	Chaymi, manapaschá.
Otherwise everything is fine.	Mana chayqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He didn’t tell the truth.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu rimarqan.
They are probably right.	Yaqapaschá allinta kanku.
Now he actually looked.	Kunanqa cheqaqtapunin qhawarirqan.
The thing was quick.	Chay imapas utqayllam karqa.
Everything is ridiculous.	Tukuy imamanta asikunapaq hinam.
This will do just fine.	Kayqa allintam ruwanqa.
But I had nothing to say.	Ichaqa manan imatapas rimanaypaq hinachu karqan.
That doesn't seem right.	Chayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
It was cold so we didn’t talk much.	Chiri karqan chaymi mana anchatachu rimaq kayku.
But you better do it.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman chayta ruwanayki.
That means being not very good or not very good.	Chayqa mana ancha allinchu utaq mana ancha allinchu kaymi.
But he couldn't wait any longer.	Ichaqa manañam suyayta atirqachu.
In fact, it has always been so.	Chiqaptaqa, ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
There is almost none.	Yaqa mana kanchu.
I could have been a good player too.	Ñuqapas allin pukllaqmi kayman karqa.
No, nothing like him, not at all.	Manan, manan imapas pay hinachu, manan imapipas.
I didn’t think much of it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu yuyaykurqani.
A very terrible looking man.	Ancha manchay rikchayniyuq runa.
If you want to live somewhere, live there.	Maypipas yachayta munanki chayqa, chaypi yachay.
The man likes it.	Runaqa gustan.
Very good, very good.	Ancha allinmi, ancha allinmi.
It was like nothing else.	Mana imapas hinam karqa.
But it was never too difficult.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha sasachu karqan.
He wanted to know more about where he was.	Payqa maypi kasqanmanta astawan yachayta munarqa.
He doesn’t care why.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imarayku chay ruwasqanmanta.
But there it is hidden.	Ichaqa chaypim pakasqa kachkan.
It makes sense here.	Kaypiqa yuyayniyuqmi kachkan.
No, nothing about me.	Manan, ñoqamanta imapas.
They are human beings.	Paykunaqa runakunam kanku.
I know about you now.	Kunanmi qanmanta yachani.
He can’t get to it.	Payqa manam chayayta atinchu.
How he would have done it is another matter.	Imaynatataq ruwanman karqan chayqa, huk ruwaymi.
You obviously want to help.	Sut’inmi yanapayta munanki.
She looked beautiful this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi sumaq rikchayniyuq karqa.
The latter will do the former.	Chay qhepa kaqmi ñawpaq kaqta ruwanqa.
They’re angry, upset, and sad.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa, phiñasqa, llakisqa ima kanku.
He is quite impressed.	Payqa allintam admirasqa kachkan.
But doing it right isn’t that simple.	Ichaqa allinta ruwayqa manan chay hina facilchu.
Today was a great day.	Kunan punchawmi hatun punchaw karqa.
He’s tired and nervous.	Payqa sayk’usqa, mancharisqa ima kashan.
He seemed a little excited.	Payqa huk chikan kusisqa hinam karqa.
It was always a big deal.	Sapa kutim hatun ruway karqa.
They are better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kanku.
So, yeah, they were something else.	Chaymi, arí, huk imapas karqaku.
Now that’s the big kid.	Kunanqa chay hatun wawa.
I mean the nice thing.	Sumaq kaqta niyta munani.
More often than not, really.	Aswan achka kuti chaymanta, chiqap.
I was half crazy.	Kuskan loco karqani.
It’s very sad when that happens.	Ancha llakikuypaqmi chayna kaptinqa.
I really couldn't stand it.	Chiqaptaqa manam aguantayta atirqanichu.
And why he has to do it.	Hinaspa imaraykun chayta ruwanan kashan.
Now you don't want me at all.	Kunanqa manan ni imapipas munawaqchu.
I don't understand how to do this.	Manam entiendenichu imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
Time to make a great cup of coffee.	Hatun kukata ruwanapaq pacha.
Older, more ancient.	Kuraq, aswan ñawpaq.
It should be good, like the real thing.	Allinmi kanan, chiqap kaq hina.
The worst problem.	Aswan millay sasachakuy.
This whole thing is absurd.	Kay tukuy imapas mana yuyayniyuqmi.
So easy, really.	Chaymi facil, chiqaptapuni.
But it doesn’t sound right.	Ichaqa mana allintachu uyarikun.
About two years ago.	Yaqa iskay wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
No, too soon.	Manan, ancha utqaylla.
So it’s not safe.	Chaymi mana segurochu.
He died not long afterwards, however.	Chay qhepamanmi ichaqa mana unaytachu wañupurqan.
We’re more serious.	Aswan serio kayku.
It won’t last long.	Mana unaytachu kanqa.
That’s the best player out there.	Chayqa aswan allin pukllaqmi chaypi.
Why not .	Imanasqa mana .
Didn't really do anything.	Mana chiqaptaqa imatapas ruwarqanchu.
Smart every day, smart every night.	Sapa punchaw yachaysapa, sapa tuta yachaysapa.
It will be there tomorrow.	Paqarinmi chaypi kanqa.
What we are, who we are.	Imataq kanchik, pi kanchik.
It was bitterly cold last night.	Qayna tutam sinchi chiri karqa.
But if this is the case .	Ichaqa kayna kaptinqa .
We did some good things.	Allin ruwaykunata ruwarqayku.
He never could.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
You’re a bad boy.	Qamqa millay wayna.
I know that is hard for you.	Yachanim chayqa sasa qampaq kasqanmanta.
Like, really bad.	Imayna, chiqap mana allin.
But everybody knows him.	Ichaqa llapa runan paytaqa yachanku.
Where they want to play.	Maypi pukllayta munanku.
I’ll go anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas risaq.
But there is no certainty.	Ichaqa manan kanchu seguro.
Something really, really big.	Imapas chiqap, chiqap hatun.
So he goes alone.	Chaymi payqa sapallan rin.
There is no year.	Chaypi mana wata.
I said the same thing.	Ñoqapas chaynatam nirqani.
That didn’t come easily.	Chayqa manan facilchu hamurqan.
However, this cannot be true.	Ichaqa manan kayqa cheqaqchu kanman.
I’m not going to go there.	Manachu chayman risaq.
But it’s not really that true anymore.	Ichaqa manañan cheqaqtachu chhayna cheqaqchu.
That was pretty much every day.	Chayqa yaqa sapa punchawmi karqa.
One man seemed terribly upset.	Huk runaqa manchay phiñasqa hinam karqa.
I did it wrong.	Chaytaqa mana allintam ruwarqani.
You are such an innocent person.	Chayna mana huchayoq runam kanki.
And the coffee here is great.	Hinaspa kaypi kukata ancha allin.
Be real, be real.	Chiqap, chiqap kay.
I know you don't want to be there.	Yachanim chaypi mana munasqaykita.
What a senseless thing.	Ima mana yuyayniyuq.
It’s better for him.	Paypaq aswan allin.
It looked like it would be there for a while.	Huk rato chaypi kanman hinam rikchakurqa.
You were there, too.	Qampas chaypim karqanki.
I don't feel comfortable at all here.	Kaypiqa manam imapipas allintachu tarikuni.
I wanted him bad enough.	Paytaqa mana allintam munarqani.
He was pretty sure he could do it.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Learn all about it here!.	¡Kaypi tukuy imamanta yachay!.
I don't think so at all.	Manam chaynataqa ni imapipas piensanichu.
But he never said no.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas mana nirqanchu.
For now at least.	Kunankamaqa aswanpas.
And then faster again.	Hinaspa chaymanta aswan utqaylla yapamanta.
People are very scared.	Runakuna ancha mancharisqa.
Everything means something.	Tukuy imapas imapas niyta munan.
Therein lies the problem.	Chaypim maypi chay sasachakuy tarikun.
He would always be busy.	Payqa sapa kutim ocupasqa kanman.
So it might be here for a while.	Chaymi huk rato kaypi kanman.
That’s not like him at all.	Chayqa manan pay hinachu ni imapipas.
From then on everything was great.	Chaymanta pacha tukuy imapas hatunmi karqa.
But never this long.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kay unaytachu.
This is a good one.	Kayqa allin chay.
Anything but that.	Imapas ichaqa chay.
And, according to this, it’s the right thing to do.	Hinaspa, kayman hinaqa, allin ruwaymi.
He couldn’t stop her, and he certainly shouldn’t have.	Payqa manan hark’ayta atirqanchu, cheqaqtapunin mana ruwananchu karqan.
Now, he is happy.	Kunanqa, payqa kusisqam kachkan.
There really beautiful.	Chaypi chiqap sumaq.
It’s hidden here.	Kaypi pakasqa kachkan.
I'm not doing it all day.	Manam tukuy punchawchu chaytaqa ruwachkani.
Now something though.	Kunanqa imapas ichaqa.
There was nothing, really.	Manam imapas karqachu, chiqaptaqa.
You never want that to happen.	Manam haykapipas chayna kananta munankichu.
It was a bit of a tough day.	Chayqa huk chikan sinchi p’unchaymi karqan.
He’s the ultimate good guy.	Payqa qhipa allin runam.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqan.
I really mean that too.	Chiqamanta chayta niyta munani ñuqapas.
No one knows what to do.	Mana pipas yachanchu ima ruwananta.
I want to be human, just like you.	Ñuqapas munani runa kayta, qam hina.
There may be ten, there may be twenty.	Chunka kanman, iskay chunka kanman.
But he knew he couldn't stay.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana qhepakuyta atisqanmanta.
I know why I need to talk to whom.	Yachanim imarayku piwan rimanaypaq.
It is always a great time.	Sapa kutim ancha allin tiempo.
But you seem very sure, now.	Ichaqa ancha seguro hinam kanki, kunanqa.
Probably next week.	Yaqapaschá hamuq semanapi.
It sounds more difficult.	Aswan sasa hinam uyarikun.
It’s beautiful but strange.	Sumaqmi ichaqa mana riqsisqa.
It will keep coming.	Hinallam hamunqa.
Can’t remember his name.	Mana sutinta yuyariyta atinchu.
No, no, there is no one.	Manan, manan, manan pipas kanchu.
You said you couldn't stop it.	Mana hark'ayta atisqaykita nirqanki.
Can't really do it wrong, you know.	Mana chiqaptachu mana allinta ruwayta atin, yachanki.
You don’t know where they are.	Manan yachankichu maypi kasqankuta.
I know exactly why.	Allintam yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
What was it that happened.	Imataq chayna karqa.
I should be happier.	Aswan kusisqam kanay.
All nice people.	Tukuy sumaq runakuna.
No, it won’t be easy.	Manan, manan facilchu kanqa.
That's a great day.	Chayqa hatun punchawmi.
You have to do everything you have to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanaykita ruwanayki tiyan.
He seems a bit excited.	Payqa huk chhikanta kusisqa hinam kachkan.
A very rich man.	Ancha qhapaq runa.
It was too intelligent for that.	Chaypaqqa llumpay yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
That's really quick.	Chayqa chiqaptam utqaylla.
And that’s very unfortunate.	Hinaspa chayqa ancha llakikuypaqmi.
That’s what he did best.	Chaytan payqa aswan allinta ruwarqan.
Everything or nothing.	Tukuy imapas icha mana imapas.
Someone later told me that it was.	Qhepamanmi pipas niwarqan chay hina kasqanmanta.
That will do him good, he says.	Chayqa allintam ruwanqa, nispas nin.
I always have a positive attitude.	Sapa kutim allin yuyayniyuq kani.
That’s fine, but it could be better.	Chayqa allinmi, ichaqa aswan allinmi kanman.
And what if it doesn’t.	Hinaspa imataq kanman mana chayna kaptinqa.
I was, again and again.	Ñuqaqa karqani, yapamanta yapamanta.
It was a beautiful but cold night.	Sumaq ichaqa chiri tutan karqan.
I do it all or nothing.	Tukuy chayta ruwani utaq mana imatapas.
He wanted her to know the truth.	Payqa munarqanmi cheqaq kaqta yachananta.
More than that, it’s just not good enough.	Aswan chaymanta, chaylla mana allinchu.
So now it’s a.	Chaymi kunanqa huk.
Don’t ever be one.	Ama hayk’aqpas huk kaychu.
He has a wonderful idea.	Payqa huk sumaq yuyayniyuqmi.
He later died in hospital.	Chay qhepamanmi hospitalpi wañupurqan.
This is where he stands out.	Kaypim payqa aswan riqsisqa.
But many, of course, are not.	Ichaqa askha, cheqaqtapunin, manan chay hinachu.
I tried to do it outdoors.	Chaytaqa hawapi ruwanaypaqmi kallpanchakurqani.
They were terrified and frightened.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa karqanku.
Almost always people.	Yaqa sapa kuti runakuna.
He knows what he wants to do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruway munasqanmanta.
It didn't seem to make any sense.	Manam imapaqpas allinchu rikchakurqa.
He was the one.	Paymi kasqa.
I’m afraid he did.	Manchakuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Much like the last one.	Anchata hina qhipa kaq.
Very much to do.	Anchata ruwanapaq.
Someone needs to do something about this.	Pipas kaymanta imatapas ruwanan.
He doesn’t want things.	Payqa manan imakunatapas munanchu.
Everyone knows he’s a great guy.	Lliwmi yachanku hatun runa kasqanmanta.
He’s kind of bad.	Payqa huk laya mana allinchu.
I couldn’t think outside the box.	Manam hawapi yuyaymanayta atirqanichu.
I know what that is about.	Yachanim imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
He seemed genuinely disappointed.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin hukmanyasqa hina karqan.
Otherwise, it’s tomorrow.	Mana chayqa, paqarin.
There is simply no point in not doing it.	Chaylla mana imapaqpas valenchu ​​mana ruwayqa.
I think he was disappointed.	Piensani hukmanyasqa kasqanmanta.
A pretty big one.	Huk sumaq hatun.
The sooner you react, the better.	Aswan utqaylla imatapas ruwanki chayqa aswan allinmi.
Doing really well.	Chiqamanta allinta ruwaspa.
Anything else might not.	Imapas manapaschá chaytaqa ruwanmanchu.
I saw him this morning.	Kunan paqarinmi payta rikurqani.
It was almost there.	Yaqa chaypi kasqa.
Saying to do one thing but really do something else.	Huk ruwayta ruwanaypaq ichaqa cheqaqtapuni hukta ruwanaypaq nispa.
I think it’s really cool, man.	Chiqamanta sumaq kasqanmanta yuyani, runa.
He had always been such a good guy.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna allin runa karqan.
But it’s not always that simple.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina facil.
He talked like a madman.	Payqa loco runa hinam rimaq.
That sounds great.	Chayqa hatunmi uyarikun.
He lives with us now.	Payqa kunanmi ñoqaykuwan tiyashan.
Stop being a busy person.	Amaña ocupasqa runa kaychu.
I was never good enough for you.	Manam haykapipas qampaq allinchu karqani.
Yes, he can’t answer.	Arí, manan kutichiyta atinchu.
He’s a big deal.	Payqa hatun ruwaymi.
Is that a fact? 	¿Cheqaqchu chay?
They want to see action.	Ruwayta rikuyta munanku.
He wouldn’t do well.	Payqa mana allintachu ruwanman.
At least it means something.	Aswanpas imapas niyta munan.
But he could have done it differently.	Ichaqa huk hinan ruwayta atinman karqan.
I was stupid, again.	Ñuqaqa sonso karqani, yapamanta.
They were all rich.	Llapallankum qhapaq karqaku.
And I mean that in a good way.	Hinaspa chayta allinta niyta munani.
Please, I’ll do this.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta ruwasaq.
I know you said no.	Yachanim mana nisqaykita.
It was today, or it was yesterday.	Kunan punchawmi karqa, utaq qayna punchawmi karqa.
But he was afraid.	Paymi ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
There it is, he said.	Chaypim kachkan, nispa.
Second, they are hard to do.	Iskay kaq, chaykunataqa sasa ruwaymi.
One of them does well.	Hukninmi allinta ruwan.
I never thought about where he was.	Manam haykapipas maypi kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
I’m of the opinion, no.	Ñuqaqa kani chay yuyayniyuq, mana.
I learned things.	Imakunatapas yacharqanim.
I was pretty tired.	Allin sayk’usqañan karqani.
But even so, it is no laughing matter.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas manam asikunapaq hinachu.
I’m not such a bad person.	Manam chayna millay runachu kani.
We are not that person.	Manam chay runachu kanchik.
It depends on the reason and purpose.	Chaypaqqa imaraykupas, imapaqpas kasqanmantam.
Again, don’t do this.	Yapamanta, ama kayta ruwaychu.
I’m crazy about you, you know that.	Loco kani qammanta, chayta yachanki.
You can never be sure with me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqawanqa segurochu kanki.
He knew he could beat someone there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi pitapas atipananta.
I don’t know how to do this.	Mana yachanichu imaynatataq kayta ruwayman.
This was the no.	Kaymi karqan mana.
She is happy to be alone.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan sapallan kasqanmanta.
A bad day was anything.	Mana allin punchawqa imapas karqa.
It’s so beautiful now.	Kunanqa ancha sumaqmi.
I really want to hear it!.	¡Anchata munani uyariyta!.
The night before.	Ñawpaq tutan.
He was a bad guy.	Payqa mana allinmi karqan.
Not sure what the best course of action is.	Mana segurochu ima aswan allin ruway kasqanmanta.
I can’t do it anymore.	Manañam atiymanchu.
I’m here again.	Hukmanta kaypi kachkani.
He really needs it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin necesitan.
So he’s right.	Chaymi payqa allinta rimachkan.
Tired of being hurt.	K’irisqa kaymanta sayk’usqa.
We disagree with each other.	Mana acuerdopichu kayku.
Everything out here is wonderful.	Kay hawapi tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi.
It could be worse .	Aswan mana allinmi kanman .
A very nice guy.	Huk ancha sumaq runa.
That may not be a good thing.	Chayqa ichapas mana allinchu kanman.
Don't look right.	Ama allintachu rikchakun.
People are not good enough.	Runakunaqa mana allinchu kanku.
Maybe there was one once.	Ichapas huk kutilla huk karqa.
Whether that is the case is uncertain.	Sichus chay kanman chayqa manan segurochu.
He thought hard.	Sinchitan yuyaykurqan.
The immediate time.	Chaylla pacha.
He didn’t know it right away.	Manam chayllachu chaytaqa yacharqa.
He thought it was there for him.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chaypi paypaq churasqa kananpaq.
He knew that was ridiculous.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayqa asikunapaq hina kasqanmanta.
He was very excited about what he could do.	Payqa ancha kusisqan kasharqan imakuna ruway atisqanmanta.
I thought you were in trouble.	Sasachakuypi kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
So it’s not difficult.	Chaymi mana sasachu.
Yes, it would be nice.	Arí, allinmi kanman.
Like many people in the world.	Kay pachapi achka runakuna hina.
So here goes, again.	Chaymi kaypi rin, yapamanta.
I can't anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam atiymanchu.
He was terrified.	Mancharisqa kasqa.
I never know if that is the case.	Manam haykapipas yachanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I didn’t mean to sound bad.	Manam millay uyariyta munarqanichu.
He’s good, well said.	Payqa allin, allin nisqa.
It was really great.	Chiqap hatunmi karqa.
That’s the day.	Chay punchawmi.
I said that last week.	Chaynatam qayna semana nirqani.
I’m a little skeptical that’s going to happen.	Chayqa huk chhikantan iskayrayani chay pasananta.
You probably didn’t know.	Manachá yacharqankichu.
But it wasn’t so easy anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chay hina facilchu karqan.
They are no better, no worse.	Paykunaqa manan aswan allinchu, manan aswan mana allinchu.
You're always so serious.	Qamqa sapa kutim ancha serio kanki.
This is always the case.	Kaymi sapa kuti chayna.
You’ll find out later.	Qhepamanmi chayta yachanki.
Can't be safe for you.	Mana qampaq seguro kayta atinchu.
This was a crazy thing to do, all right.	Kayqa loco ruwaymi karqa, allinmi.
He’s been working on it for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chaypi llank’ashan.
Many people know it.	Achka runakunam yachanku.
He couldn't hold it.	Manam hapiyta atirqachu.
I don't want him to get hurt anymore.	Manañam munanichu k'irisqa kananta.
I felt ready.	Listo hinam tarikurqani.
It was so crazy.	Ancha loco kasqa.
A journey had to be made.	Huk puriyta ruwana karqan.
What do you know about it.	Imatataq yachanki.
I would love to work with him.	Paywan kuska llamkayta anchata munani.
I’m afraid of something.	Imatapas manchakuni.
And you’re drunk.	Hinaspa machasqa kanki.
The reason for the disagreement could be this.	Chay mana acuerdopi kasqanmantaqa kaymi kanman.
They are both there now.	Kunanqa iskayninkum chaypi kachkanku.
And here’s something else.	Hinaspa kaypi huk imapas.
He didn’t really know how to talk.	Payqa manan allintachu yacharqan imayna rimayta.
Yes, I was busy as of late.	Arí, tarde hina ocupasqa karqani.
This looks really good though.	Kayqa chiqap allin rikchakun ichaqa.
Man, they were amazing.	Runa, paykunaqa admirakuypaqmi karqaku.
It would actually be funny.	Chiqaptaqa asikunapaq hinam kanman.
Another time, which.	Huk pacha, mayqin.
I highly doubt it will.	Anchatam iskayrayani chayna kananta.
Eat at the right time.	Tiempollanpi mikhuy.
Once then you know it’s no big deal.	Huk kuti chaymanta yachanki mana hatun ruwaychu.
We did everything together.	Tukuy imatam kuska ruwarqayku.
So a month passed.	Chaymi huk killa pasarqa.
There is so much uncertainty.	Ancha achka mana seguro kaymi kachkan.
Common sense is essential.	Allin yuyayniyuq kayqa ancha allinmi.
No one thought of anything.	Mana pipas imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
It had been a nasty winter for a long time.	Unayñan millay chiri tiempo karqan.
Really excited about it.	Chiqap kusisqa chaymanta.
They were completely excluded.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta qarqusqa karqanku.
He wasn’t good enough yet.	Payqa manaraqmi allinchu kasqa.
Say no to more things.	Aswan imakunatapas mana niy.
A person or persons.	Huk runa utaq runakuna.
I have no idea how that would be.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna chay kanman chayta.
Sounds like a nice thing to do.	Sumaq ruway hinam uyarikun.
This is the first time this has happened.	Kaymi ñawpaq kutipi chayna pasarqa.
I’m not sure what, really.	Manam segurochu kani ima, chiqaptaqa.
But it probably means there was a problem in the past.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá niyta munan ñawpaqpi sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
He was very good at it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypi karqa.
One is as important as the other.	Hukninmi huknin hina ancha allin.
One person cannot do it.	Huk runaqa manam ruwayta atinmanchu.
Unfortunately, I can't find a way around this problem.	Llakikuypaqmi, manam tarinichu kay sasachakuymanta lluqsiyta.
The truth was, he was right.	Cheqaq kaqmi karqan, payqa allintan rimarqan.
He's a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqaptam sumaq runa.
Everyone is smart.	Lliwmi yachaysapa.
I have to do something tonight.	Kunan tuta imatapas ruwanay tiyan.
He didn’t know why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku.
I mean, everybody was there.	Niyta munani, llapa runa chaypi karqanku.
This was the stupidity.	Kaymi karqan sonso kayqa.
I think that might be the case.	Yuyaykuni chay hina kanman.
But he knows that's wrong.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay mana allin kasqanmanta.
Every day should be enjoyable.	Sapa punchawmi kusisqa kanan.
I mean no one thought anything of him.	Niyta munani mana pipas paymanta imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
You talked all the time.	Tukuy tiempon rimaq kanki.
Maybe you want to learn something new.	Ichapas huk musuq yachayta munanki.
I thought that was silly.	Chayqa mana yuyayniyuq kananpaqmi piensarqani.
I’m sorry again.	Hukmanta llakikuni.
Everything went too fast.	Tukuy imapas llumpay utqayllam rirqa.
That’s the only way to do it right.	Chayllam allinta ruwananchikpaq.
A real quick one.	Huk chiqap utqaylla.
Being wrong doesn't matter.	Pantasqa kayqa manam imananpaschu.
I don’t really know how hard it is.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
They want it now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi munanku.
They were such people.	Chayna runakunam karqaku.
That sounds amazing.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi uyarikun.
Things were never right.	Imapas manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
I was a stranger.	Mana riqsisqa runam karqani.
He was a young, serious young man.	Payqa wayna, serio wayna kasqa.
All very familiar.	Tukuy ancha riqsisqa.
If you want to do that.	Sichus chayta ruwayta munanki chayqa.
But there is something.	Ichaqa imapas kanmi.
I know he wants to see it.	Yachanim qawayta munasqanmanta.
This very moment.	Kay kikin rato.
So far it has been easy.	Kunankamaqa facilmi karqa.
He refused, again and again.	Payqa mana munarqanchu, yapamanta yapamanta.
He was cold, cold, hungry and tired.	Payqa chiri, chiri, yarqasqa, sayk’usqa ima kasqa.
That would have been a daunting task.	Chayqa sinchi sasa ruwaymi kanman karqan.
Obviously I’m not that person.	Sut’inmi mana chay runachu kani.
But not much of it.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu.
I don't know what to do.	Manam yachanichu ni imatataq ruwayman.
He has always been so good.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna allin karqa.
I have the mind to do it.	Yuyayniyuqmi kani ruwanaypaq.
Know that he feels good.	Allin sientekusqanmanta yachay.
They both love to work.	Iskayninkum anchata munanku llamkayta.
I can’t remember how to do it right.	Mana yuyariyta atinichu imaynatachus allinta ruwanaypaq.
I can’t say why not.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imarayku mana nispa.
Maybe always.	Ichapas sapa kuti.
And that’s what you are.	Hinaspa chaymi qamqa kanki.
That’s certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin.
Who are you really? 	¿Pitaq kanki chiqaptapuni?
I know what what it is.	Yachanim ima ima kasqanmanta.
However, it would be nice.	Ichaqa, allinmi kanman.
It’s a good thing for him, man.	Allinmi paypaq runa.
I'm actually not sure about that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
It’s a good difficulty.	Allin sasam.
Maybe the whole month.	Ichapas tukuy killa.
He would have been innocent.	Payqa mana huchayoq hinan kanman karqan.
That's the funniest thing with anyone.	Chayqa piwanpas aswan asikunapaq hinam.
He didn’t want to see her again.	Payqa manañan hukmanta rikuyta munarqanchu.
Many times less.	Achka kuti aswan pisi.
You’re a pity.	Llakikuypaqmi kanki.
He was sober now.	Kunanqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kasqa.
He was something of a local celebrity.	Payqa imapas chay llaqtapi riqsisqa runa hinam karqa.
In fact, we barely talked.	Aswanpas yaqapaschá rimaq kayku.
Obviously this is the best.	Sut’inmi kayqa aswan allinqa.
No one in the whole world.	Tukuy kay pachapi mana pipas.
I was like you at one time.	Huk tiempopiqa qan hinan karqani.
That is too difficult, however.	Chayqa llumpay sasam ichaqa.
Yes, he is a black man.	Arí, payqa yana runam.
I probably said that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa nirqani.
I suspect it would do well.	Sospechani allinta ruwanman.
There is nothing hidden.	Manam imapas pakasqa kanchu.
So he might be angry.	Chaymi yaqapaschá phiñasqa kanman.
Will do better next time.	Aswan allinta ruwanqa hamuq kutipi.
That seems like a lot to avoid.	Chayqa achka mana ruwanapaq hinam.
Something must be seriously wrong.	Imapas sinchi mana allinchu kanan.
That would have been a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman karqan.
No, that wasn’t a real person.	Manan, chayqa manan cheqaq runachu karqan.
He felt very uncomfortable.	Payqa ancha mana allintam tarikurqa.
He was eager to help.	Payqa anchatan yanapayta munarqan.
I’m not sure, otherwise.	Manam segurochu, mana chayqa.
This might make some sense.	Kayqa wakin yuyayniyuq kanman.
He never had a reason to do that.	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwananpaqqa imaraykupas karqachu.
Another two, maybe.	Huk iskay, ichapas.
It just won’t do.	Chaylla mana ruwanqachu.
I know where to go.	Mayman riyta yachani.
I don’t feel depressed.	Manam llakisqa hinam tarikuni.
Great if true.	Hatun sichus chiqap.
Available in Black.	Yana simipi tarikun.
He certainly never noticed it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa repararqanchu.
I know how to drive a car.	Yachanim carrota manejayta.
I really want to understand.	Chiqamanta entiendeyta munani.
This was a wicked man.	Kayqa millay runam karqa.
Good thing he was scared and scared.	Allinmi mancharisqa hinaspa mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
There is no mention of this here.	Kaypiqa manam huk kaymanta rimayqa kanchu.
It will be great for you.	Hatunmi kanqa qanpaq.
I wouldn’t be okay with that.	Chaywanqa manam allinchu kayman.
He may not be alone.	Manapaschá sapallanchu kanman.
He did everything he could.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwarqa.
But otherwise it’s pretty easy.	Ichaqa mana chayqa ancha facilmi.
He can speak well.	Payqa allintam rimayta atin.
But he knew why.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
I’m worried about myself.	Ñuqaqa ñuqamanta llakikuni.
It came out quickly.	Chayqa utqaylla lluqsirqa.
This statement should be correct.	Kay rimayqa allintam kanan.
That will be a lot tonight.	Chayqa kunan tutam achka kanqa.
If you are sure.	Sichus seguro kanki chayqa.
The last step.	Qhipa kaq ruway.
It was actually really good.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta allin karqa.
I'm really proud of it.	Chiqaptam orgulloso kani.
I’m really, really excited.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta kusisqa kachkani.
He wanted well, but he felt lonely.	Allintam munarqa, ichaqa sapallanmi tarikurqa.
He didn’t talk much to anyone.	Payqa manan piwanpas anchatachu rimaq.
It’s not bad at all.	Mana imapipas mana allinchu.
Or, you know, the last one.	Utaq, yachanki, qhipa kaq.
Every time something happened.	Sapa kutim imapas pasarqa.
I’m injured.	Ñuqaqa k’irisqa kani.
They are everything.	Paykunaqa tukuy imapas kanku.
Yeah, he's being that stupid.	Arí, payqa chayna sonso hinam kachkan.
So, that’s for sure.	Chaymi, chaymi seguro.
But you know a secret.	Ichaqa huk pakasqa kaqta yachanki.
Not angry, just .	Mana phiñasqa, chaylla .
I should have been there by now.	Kunankamaqa chaypim kanay karqa.
They are the best of the best.	Paykunaqa aswan allin kaqmi.
No one is there now.	Kunanqa manam pipas chaypiqa kanchu.
In fact, it was easier.	Aswanpas aswan facilmi karqan.
In fact, it’s .	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa .
He couldn't think about it.	Chaypiqa manam yuyaymanayta atirqachu.
It’s like a child.	Wawa hinam.
I did this to him.	Paytaqa kaytan ruwarqani.
This, no one else can ever do.	Kaytaqa, manan hayk’aqpas huk runaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
So this was the first real day.	Chaymi kayqa karqan ñawpaq kaq cheqaq p’unchay.
Maybe it was, there.	Ichapas karqa, chaypi.
Everyone said that.	Chaytaqa llapallankum nirqa.
John couldn't help but smile.	Juanqa manam ima ruwaytapas atirqachu.
This was so interesting, and intense, and funny.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa, hinaspa sinchi, hinaspa asikunapaq hina.
I was lucky maybe.	Suerteyoqmi karqani ichapas.
But he caught on quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan hap’irqan.
The first one is included.	Ñawpaq kaqmi churasqa kachkan.
I still don't feel like me.	Kunankamapas manañam ñuqa hinachu sientekuni.
He can't see much of anything.	Payqa manam anchatachu imatapas rikuyta atin.
He wanted to talk, he wanted to say something.	Payqa rimayta munarqa, imatapas niyta munarqa.
Maybe coming here.	Ichapas kayman hamuq.
Everyone knows who he is now.	Lliwmi yachanku kunan pi kasqanmanta.
We did what we had to do.	Imatachus ruwanayku kaqta ruwarqayku.
Man, that was it.	Runa, chaymi karqan.
Yes, he is very good.	Arí, payqa ancha allinmi.
Its beauty cannot be described.	Sumaq kasqanmantaqa manam willayta atichwanchu.
Did he do it wrong?.	¿Mana allintachu ruwarqa?.
He hadn’t said anything for a long time.	Unayñan mana imatapas nirqanchu.
There was too much uncertainty now.	Kunanqa llumpay mana seguro kaymi karqa.
Again, this is just me.	Yapamanta, kayqa ñuqallam.
He is not so sure.	Payqa manan chhayna segurochu kashan.
Which is good, obviously.	Imataq allin, sut’inmi.
Another day, more.	Huk punchaw, aswan achka.
He was alone with her.	Payqa sapallanmi paywan kasharqan.
No one seems to have thought of it before.	Manapaschá pipas ñawpaqtaqa yuyaykurqanchu hinan.
Such a beautiful evening.	Chayna sumaq chisi.
That was too recent.	Chayqa llumpay chayllaraqmi karqa.
Here I am, he wanted to say.	Kaypi kachkani, nispas niyta munarqa.
It went pretty well.	Allin allintam pasarqa.
He knew it on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa yacharqan.
Now everyone knows about it.	Kunanqa llapa runam chaymantaqa yachanku.
He might do it again.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta chayta ruwanman.
Now, for no apparent reason, there was nothing left.	Kunanmi ichaqa mana imaraykupas manaña imapas karqachu.
That's not where you are.	Chayqa manam chaypichu kachkanki.
Failure in two steps.	Iskay ruwaypi mana allin ruway.
But that repetition is too frequent.	Ichaqa chay yapamanta ruwayqa ancha sapa kutillanmi.
She was wonderful to have here.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa kaypi kananpaq.
People really sick.	Runakuna chiqap unqusqa.
It’s not good of me.	Mana allinmi ñuqamanta.
Extremely very good though.	Sinchi ancha allinmi ichaqa.
That will happen later.	Qhepamanmi chayqa kanqa.
He said he didn’t want it anymore.	Payqa manañam munanichu nispa.
That’s all this is.	Chayllam kayqa.
But now he is not sure.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan segurochu kashan.
That will be the	Chayqa kanqa .
Yes, the same person.	Arí, kikin runa.
But nothing will work if you do that.	Ichaqa chayta ruwaspaqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
But it was funny.	Ichaqa asikunapaq hinam karqa.
If he got one.	Sichus hukta chaskirqan chayqa.
If so, it’s absurd.	Chayna kaptinqa, mana yuyayniyuqmi.
Eventually he thought of something.	Qhepamanmi imapipas yuyaykurqan.
No one can stand that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas aguantayta atinmanchu.
It doesn’t say much.	Mana anchatachu riman.
In fact, it was better.	Aswanpas aswan allinmi karqan.
But he wants nothing to do with her.	Ichaqa manan munanchu paywan ima ruwaytapas.
I’m just not ready yet.	Chayllaraqmi manaraq listochu kani.
So he could do something to overcome it.	Chaymi chayta atipananpaq imatapas ruwayta atinman karqan.
What should be, will be.	Imataq kanan, kanqa.
This sounds like it should be good.	Kayqa allin kanan hinam uyarikun.
Now, it can be premature.	Kunanqa, ñawpaqmantaraqmi kanman.
That was the kind of person he was.	Chayqa chayna runam karqa.
Then, twice.	Chaymanta, iskay kutita.
No reason, no reason.	Mana imaraykupas, mana imaraykupas.
I'm sure you have a lot to do.	Seguro kani achka ruwanayki kasqanmanta.
We had a big party last week.	Qhipa semanapi hatun fiestata ruwarqayku.
I wish it wasn’t me.	Munaymanmi mana ñuqachu.
Couldn't, couldn't, couldn't make it.	Mana atirqachu, mana atirqachu, mana atirqachu chayayta.
This was really funny.	Kayqa chiqap asikunapaq hinam karqa.
This seemed like all morning.	Kayqa tukuy paqarin hinam karqa.
He wanted to fix this.	Kayta allichayta munarqa.
There’s a mistake there.	Chaypin huk pantasqa kashan.
They are all very cold.	Llapallankum ancha chiri.
Something strange happened today.	Kunan punchawmi imapas mana riqsisqa pasarqa.
Maybe he didn’t feel comfortable.	Ichapas mana allintachu tarikurqa.
But you can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
To commit horrible crimes.	Millay millay ruwaykunata ruwananpaq.
Everyone was crazy.	Lliwmi loco karqaku.
I look forward to working with him again.	Suyachkani hukmanta paywan llamkayta.
Not most of the time anyway.	Mana yaqa llapan kutichu imayna kaptinpas.
I don't remember that there.	Chaytaqa manam chaypiqa yuyarinichu.
Yes, he can do that.	Arí, chaytan ruwanman.
What was the solution? 	¿Imatam ruwana karqa?
I don’t know, I do.	Manam yachanichu, ñuqa.
An hour later they were hungry again.	Huk hora qhepamanmi hukmanta yarqaymanta karqanku.
Something happened, folks.	Imapas pasarqa, runakuna.
One of them says.	Hukninmi nin.
It needs to be something bigger.	Aswan hatun ruwaymi kanan.
There is no truth.	Manam kanchu chiqap kaqta.
That’s right, it’s cold.	Chayqa, chiri.
I know that, for sure.	Chaytaqa yachanim, chiqaptapuni.
I know you can convince him.	Yachanim payta convencechiyta atisqaykita.
Everything is well hidden.	Tukuy imapas allinta pakasqa kachkan.
He knows you’re out here.	Payqa yachanmi kay hawapi kasqaykita.
Actually, me too.	Chiqaptaqa ñuqapas.
He didn’t really rush it.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chayta usqhaylla ruwarqan.
Maybe the worst part is.	Ichapas aswan mana allinqa kanman.
Intelligent, intelligent, intelligent.	Yuyayniyuq, yuyayniyuq, yuyayniyuq.
I hope you are up to it now.	Munaymanmi kunan chayman hina kanaykita.
Almost, but not yet.	Yaqa, ichaqa manaraqmi.
So, we had to do two things.	Chaymi, iskay ruwaykunata ruwanayku karqa.
But unfortunately that’s not all.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi mana chayllachu.
I couldn't figure out how to do this.	Manam yuyaymanayta atirqanichu imaynata kayta ruwanaypaq.
And again today.	Hinaspa yapamanta kunan punchaw.
Mary opened the door.	Mariaqa punkuta kicharirqa.
First of all, maybe.	Ñawpaqtaqa ichapas.
I want to come too.	Ñuqapas hamuyta munani.
I don’t remember everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas yuyarinichu.
I don’t know if that would work.	Mana yachanichu chay ruway allinchu kanman icha manachu chayta.
I really don't know what to do here.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu kaypi imata ruwanaypaq.
This is a quick and easy process.	Kayqa utqaylla hinaspa mana sasa ruwaymi.
This wouldn't do it at all.	Kayqa manam imapipas ruwanmanchu.
He couldn’t have that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa atinmanchu karqan.
About three days later he got one.	Yaqa kinsa p’unchay qhepamanmi hukta chaskirqan.
There’s nothing to make it big again.	Manan imapas kanchu yapamanta hatun ruwanapaq.
Sad and anxious, but not angry.	Llakisqa hinaspa llakisqa, ichaqa mana phiñasqa.
It usually sounds smart.	Yaqa llapanpim yachaysapa hina uyarikun.
They are current and present.	Paykunaqa kunan pacha, kunan ima kanku.
Very young, actually.	Ancha wayna, chiqaptaqa.
Something very cold.	Imapas ancha chiri.
It was madness, indeed.	Loco kaymi karqan, cheqaqtapunin.
I didn’t want to talk to him yet.	Manaraqmi paywan rimayta munarqanichu.
It was good, it was good.	Allinmi karqa, allinmi karqa.
This is either, or, or.	Kayqa icha, icha, icha nispam.
That you have a better idea.	Chay aswan allin yuyayniyuq kasqaykita.
He was a great man at the time.	Payqa chay tiempopiqa hatun runam karqa.
But he stayed with me.	Ichaqa ñoqawanmi qhepakurqan.
But I'm not sure anymore.	Ichaqa manañam segurochu kani.
Maybe someone in town.	Ichapas llaqtapi pipas.
Do that if you really want to.	Chaytaqa ruway chiqaptapuni munaspaqa.
He had no choice if he really thought that.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu sichus cheqaqtapuni chayta yuyaykurqan chayta.
He wanted to be like her.	Payqa pay hina kaytan munarqan.
Maybe most people.	Ichapas yaqa llapan runakuna.
Yes, everything would be fine.	Arí, tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
Not so much now.	Kunanqa mana anchatachu.
And now that person is gone.	Hinaspa kunanqa manaña chay runaqa.
I have no way of telling you.	Manam imayna willanaypaq kanchu.
I would love to do it again and again.	Munaymanmi hukmanta yapamanta ruwayta.
Maybe it’s a good thing anyway.	Ichapas allin kaq kanman imayna kaptinpas.
Surely he should have been ready by now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunankamaqa listoña kanan karqan.
They were all in a hurry.	Llapallankum utqaylla karqaku.
Drove home the second half of the day.	Iskay kaq kuska punchaw wasiman carropi rirqa.
But it was probably the only thing that was accepted.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaylla allinpaq qhawarisqa karqan.
One to go for it.	Huk rinanpaq.
Not yet.	Manaraqmi.
So now you’re not there anymore.	Chaymi kunanqa manaña chaypichu kanki.
He couldn’t have come.	Payqa manan hamuyta atinmanchu karqan.
He seemed terribly lonely.	Payqa manchay sapallan hinam karqa.
But anyone, anyway.	Ichaqa pipas, imayna kaptinpas.
Everyone is fine.	Llapallankum allin kachkanku.
I want to go home for a bit.	Huk chhikanta wasiyman ripuyta munani.
But they seem terribly angry.	Ichaqa manchay phiñasqa hinan kanku.
This is huge, huge.	Kayqa hatun, hatunmi.
I was proud of myself.	Ñoqaqa orgulloso karqani.
They were that good.	Paykunaqa chayna allinmi karqaku.
Then here’s a second.	Chaymanta kaypi huk iskay kaq.
I knew the language.	Chay simitaqa yacharqanim.
I don’t think about it now.	Manam kunanqa yuyaykunichu.
You know, this moment.	Yachanki, kay rato.
Here, it is not.	Kaypiqa, manam.
It’s such a simple but effective process.	Chayna facil ichaqa allin ruwaymi.
Very, very strong.	Ancha, ancha sinchi.
I need something more.	Astawan imatapas necesitasaq.
Always go big.	Sapa kuti hatun riy.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munanichu karqa.
Everything sounds great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi uyarikun.
It’s difficult here.	Kaypiqa sasam.
That wasn’t a good thing he did.	Chay ruwasqanqa manan allinchu karqan.
He said it many times.	Achka kutitam chayta nirqa.
Almost all day long.	Yaqa tukuy punchaw.
He told me these things.	Paymi chaykunataqa niwarqa.
So they know for sure it’s you.	Chaymi paykunaqa allinta yachanku qan kasqaykita.
You know what, probably not.	Yachanki imata, manapaschá.
I still don't know much.	Kunankamapas manam anchatachu yachani.
It’s really serious.	Chiqaptam serio.
No one is so sure about that now.	Kunanqa manan pipas chaymantaqa chhayna segurochu kashan.
I want to never see him again.	Munani manaña hayk’aqpas payta rikuyta.
He didn’t stay there long.	Payqa manan unaytachu chaypi qhepakurqan.
Now here's the thing.	Kunanqa kaypi kachkan chay imapas.
You’re not always alone.	Manan sapa kutichu sapallayki kanki.
But it was against his will.	Ichaqa mana munasqanman hinam karqa.
I didn’t want to party.	Manam fiestata ruwayta munarqanichu.
He’s a great good guy.	Payqa hatun allin runam.
Maybe he needs some money.	Ichapas huk qullqita necesitan.
And that's kind of where it is.	Hinaspa chaymi chayna maypi kachkan.
It was that serious.	Chayna serio karqa.
But really, there is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin, kan.
And that’s the big deal.	Hinaspa chaymi hatun ruway.
This is a terrible thing to do.	Kayqa manchay millay ruwaymi.
I don’t want to see it anymore.	Manañam astawan qawayta munanichu.
Unfortunately, this was not an isolated event.	Llakikuypaqmi, kayqa manam sapallan ruwaychu karqa.
So he went out.	Chaymi payqa lluqsirqa.
It’s not good, yes.	Mana allinchu, arí.
That was three and a half years ago.	Chayqa karqan kinsa wata kuskan ñawpaqtaraqmi.
It probably does very well.	Yaqapaschá ancha allinta ruwan.
Obviously this is wrong.	Sut’inmi kayqa mana allinchu.
But it’s too nice to be true .	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi cheqaq kananpaq .
There is no set time.	Manam churasqa tiempo kanchu.
I really want it to be true.	Anchatam munani chiqap kananta.
Not fast enough, of course.	Mana usqhayllachu, chiqamanta.
But, how about next year.	Ichaqa, imaynataq hamuq wata.
Everything always had a reason.	Tukuy imapas sapa kutim imaraykupas karqa.
Before that.	Manaraq chaymanta.
But he said nothing to her.	Ichaqa manan imatapas paytaqa nirqanchu.
He left a message.	Huk willakuyta saqirqa.
He’s young, scared like a boy.	Payqa wayna, wayna hina mancharisqa.
He said he couldn’t do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwayta atisqanmanta nisqa.
Nowhere, never again.	Mana maypipas, manaña hayk’aqpas.
That’s where I learned to ride a bike.	Chaypin yacharqani bicicletapi puriyta.
We are not nearly as good now.	Kunanqa manam yaqa allinchu kanchik.
Then, he looked hard.	Chaymanta, sinchita qhawarisqa.
He said he felt human.	Paymi nirqa runa hina sientekusqanmanta.
He thought it would be awkward.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruwayqa mana allinpaq kananta.
But he wants to be a better person.	Ichaqa aswan allin runa kaytan munan.
I wonder what his name is.	Tapukuni ima sutin kasqanmanta.
And, as usual, most people were outraged.	Hinaspa, sapa kuti hina, yaqa llapan runakuna phiñasqa karqanku.
First this, then everything else.	Ñawpaqtaqa kay, chaymanta tukuy ima.
However, this is a good thing.	Ichaqa, kayqa allinmi.
So yeah, about a year and a half.	Chaymi arí, yaqa huk wata kuskan.
They are seriously injured.	Paykunaqa sinchitan k'irisqa kashanku.
I know he is a bad guy.	Yachanim mana allin runa kasqanmanta.
I'm really, really sorry.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam llakikuni.
There had to be something that day that made me do something.	Chay punchawmi imapas kanan karqa imatapas ruwanaypaq.
You can’t remember.	Manam yuyariyta atiwaqchu.
There he is, yes.	Chaypin payqa kashan, arí.
I’m worried about this now.	Kunanmi kaymanta llakikuni.
As usual, he was ambivalent about it.	Sapa kuti hinam chaymanta iskay yuyayniyuq karqa.
He does what he has to do.	Imatachus ruwanan kaqta ruwan.
In his actions.	Ruwasqanpi.
The man looked horrified.	Chay runaqa mancharisqa qhawarisqa.
That's why he was out here today.	Chayraykum kunan punchaw kay hawapi karqa.
They are very uncertain.	Paykunaqa ancha mana seguro kaymi.
As if that’s something that matters.	Chayqa imapas importante kanman hina.
He’d been hurt before.	Payqa ñawpaqtaraqmi k’irisqa kasqa.
Mary and I.	Mariawan ñuqawan.
Someone was probably there that day.	Chay punchawqa yaqapaschá pipas chaypiqa karqa.
I’m going to do that.	Ñoqaqa chaytam ruwasaq.
He was the second oldest.	Payqa iskay kaq kuraq kaqmi karqan.
He would be like that.	Payqa chhayna kanman.
I don’t care, anyway.	Manam imananpaschu, imayna kaptinpas.
Everything didn't seem like much for that.	Chaypaqqa tukuy imapas mana ancha hinachu rikchakurqa.
There were maybe twenty people.	Ichapas iskay chunka runakuna karqaku.
He was not going to agree.	Payqa manan acuerdopichu kanan karqan.
That’s easy to do.	Chayqa facilmi ruwayqa.
I’ve had a tough day.	Sinchi p’unchaymi karqani.
I don't do this often.	Kaytaqa manam sapa kutichu ruwani.
Surprisingly, they looked good.	Admirakuypaqmi ichaqa allin rikchayniyuq karqaku.
He’s not here, but he was someone else.	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan, ichaqa huk runan karqan.
I already felt very guilty.	Ñam ancha huchayoq hina tarikurqani.
This is not a new idea.	Kayqa manam musuq yuyayniyuqchu.
That’s what you want.	Chaytaqa munanki.
I thought it went really well.	Yuyarqanim ancha allinta risqanmanta.
He said there was no one else in the car.	Paymi nirqa carropi mana huk runa kasqanmanta.
That’s after some time.	Chayqa huk tiempo qhepamanmi.
It’s actually really funny.	Chiqamanta chiqamanta asikunapaq.
Worse new now.	Aswan mana allin musuq kunan.
Yes, it was good there.	Arí, chaypiqa allinmi karqa.
I think he’ll do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanqa nispa.
You'll find out tonight.	Kunan tutam chayta yachanki.
Really happy with that.	Chiqamanta kusisqa chaywan.
It was easier back then.	Chay tiempopiqa aswan facilmi karqa.
He will have some ideas.	Payqa wakin yuyayniyuqmi kanqa.
I desperately need to not do this.	Sinchitan necesitasaq kayta mana ruwanaypaq.
Learn more every day.	Sapa punchaw astawan yachay.
I think you should be with him.	Yuyaykuni paywan kanaykita.
Maybe in the near future.	Ichapas chayllaraq hamuq tiempopi.
About that time the patient went to a big party.	Chay pacha hinam unqusqa hatun fiestaman rirqa.
So it was a real, real challenge.	Chaymi chiqap, chiqap sasachakuy karqa.
This is the first step.	Kayqa ñawpaq ruwaymi.
It should be today.	Kunan punchawmi kanan.
I wasn’t really surprised.	Manam chiqaptachu admirakurqani.
He knows but he doesn’t know what yet.	Payqa yachanmi ichaqa manaraqmi yachanchu imatachus chayta.
So it was all pretty crazy.	Chaymi tukuy imapas allin loco karqa.
And, it wasn’t a big deal.	Hinaspa, manan hatun ruwaychu karqan.
I think about you so much.	Anchatam piensani qammanta.
You want everything to be like you.	Tukuy ima qan hina kananta munanki.
He was recently arrested.	Chayllaraqmi hapisqa karqa.
I don't know the best way to do this.	Manam yachanichu kayta ruwanaypaq aswan allin ruwayta.
Unfortunately, no one knows what they are yet.	Llakikuypaqmi manaraq pipas yachanchu ima kasqankuta.
Who knows what he did to her.	Pitaq yachan imatachus paywan ruwasqanmanta.
But not really right now.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kunanpacha.
The first day of the morning.	Ñawpaq p’unchaw paqarin.
They’re bad, of course.	Paykunaqa mana allinchu kanku, chiqamanta.
Time at the end of the day.	P'unchaw tukukuypi pacha.
I will be a teacher.	Ñoqaqa yachachiqmi kasaq.
What is his next challenge.	Imataq paypaq qatiqnin sasachakuy kasqanmanta.
Things could have been better.	Imapas aswan allinmi kanman karqa.
I am a lonely person.	Ñuqaqa sapallan runam kani.
It makes things easier.	Chaywanmi imapas mana sasachu.
That is why we must do something tonight.	Chayraykum kunan tuta imatapas ruwananchik.
Tell him to go.	Rinanpaq niy.
I don’t want to drive it.	Manam chaytaqa manejayta munanichu.
I always wanted them.	Chaykunataqa sapa kutillanmi munarqani.
The second virtue is good.	Iskay kaq allin kayqa allinmi.
He said he did not.	Payqa nirqam mana chayna ruwasqanmanta.
It was like last year anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas qayna wata hinam karqa.
I’m not so happy to be me.	Manam chayna kusisqachu kani ñuqa kaspayqa.
Let me know if that works.	Chay allin kaptinqa willaway.
Very uncomfortable for about half an hour.	Ancha mana allinchu yaqa kuskan hora.
It wasn’t true then, and it’s not true now.	Chay tiempopiqa manan cheqaqchu karqan, kunanqa manañan cheqaqchu.
I don't want to do this job.	Manam kay llamkayta ruwayta munanichu.
Actually, there never was.	Chiqaptaqa, manam haykapipas karqachu.
I’m not a good person.	Manam allintachu runa kani.
It never really existed.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa karqachu.
The best restaurant in town.	Llaqtapi aswan allin mikhuy wasi.
She left him, in fact.	Payqa payta saqirqa, chiqaptaqa.
I couldn’t, well.	Manam atirqanichu, allinta.
No one is there yet.	Manaraqmi pipas chaypichu kachkan.
I know you have intelligence.	Yachanim yuyayniyuq kasqaykita.
But it was still a big deal for me.	Ichaqa chayna kaptinpas hatun ruwaymi karqa ñuqapaq.
And you are just there for me.	Hinaspa qamqa ñuqapaq hinallam kanki.
You can’t beat him.	Manan atiwaqchu paytaqa.
Yes, he was a man.	Arí, payqa runan karqan.
But go and tell me.	Ichaqa riy, willaway.
What a crazy, crazy time.	Ima loco, loco tiempo.
And that someone was me.	Hinaspa chay pipas ñuqa karqani.
But it probably wasn't right.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
In most cases, this was the best way to do it.	Yaqa llapanpim chay ruwayqa aswan allin karqa.
I didn’t know much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa yacharqani.
I'm sure he knows about me.	Seguro kani ñuqamanta yachasqanmanta.
Go please where you were told before.	Riy ama hina kaspa maypichus ñawpaqta nisurqanki chaypi.
He was afraid of this.	Payqa kayta mancharisqa kasqa.
There it was, that was it.	Chaypim karqa, chaymi karqa.
I’ve been feeling bad all week.	Tukuy semanan mana allintachu sientekuni.
But it’s not really there.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kashan.
It’s really, really, really hard.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta, chiqamanta sinchi sasa.
I have to be here.	Kaypi kanay tiyan.
Just tell me where you want to get to.	Mayman chayayta munanki chaylla willaway.
He knew he couldn’t walk.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana puriyta atisqanmanta.
Whoever he was.	Pichus payqa karqan.
Here and nowhere else.	Kaypi mana maypipas.
He may not like to talk about it.	Payqa manapaschá chaymanta rimayqa gustanchu.
I know what it will do.	Yachanim imakuna ruwananta.
But then he was a nice guy.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa sumaq runam karqa.
That’s just another.	Chaylla huk.
That’s all this was.	Chayllam kayqa karqa.
He told me you were there.	Paymi niwarqa chaypi kasqaykita.
No one can reach it.	Manam pipas chayayta atinmanchu.
It won’t be a nice idea.	Mana sumaq yuyayniyuqchu kanqa.
We did it with that.	Chaywanmi ruwarqayku.
House next year.	Wasi hamuq wata.
Here’s a baby.	Kaypi huk wawa.
Of course, he couldn’t.	Arí, payqa manan atirqanchu.
Beautiful, actually.	Sumaq, chiqaptaqa.
That is not available here.	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa kanchu.
I mean, he’s .	Niyta munani, payqa .
He doesn’t know what it is.	Payqa manan yachanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
This is a really nice feature.	Kayqa chiqap sumaq ruwaymi.
It would be nice, actually.	Sumaq kanman, chiqaptaqa.
Man, it was cold.	Runa, chiri kasqa.
Know that it will take some time.	Yachay huk tiempota pasananta.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukuni imanasqataq chayna kasqanmanta.
This was a difficult task.	Kayqa sasa ruwaymi karqa.
That was pretty easy.	Chayqa allin facilmi karqa.
These are really great.	Kaykunaqa chiqap hatunmi.
He’s a pipe.	Payqa pipas.
He did this all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon kay hinata ruwaq.
Soon, . . .	Pisi tiempollamantan, .
Now they really were.	Kunanqa cheqaqtapunin karqanku.
He's tired, so he's very tired.	Payqa sayk'usqa, chaymi ancha sayk'usqa.
This, of course, does.	Kayqa, chiqamanta, ruwan.
That’s some house.	Chayqa wakin wasi.
So go ahead and say so.	Chaymi riy, chaynata niy.
We are so glad he is here with us.	Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku kaypi ñuqaykuwan kuska kasqanmanta.
But for everything else.	Ichaqa tukuy imapaqpas.
Mary is alone.	Mariaqa sapallanmi kachkan.
And one, two, and .	Hinaspa huk, iskay, hinaspa .
And he preferred long.	Hinaspa payqa aswan allinpaq qhawarirqan unayta.
They stand out above all else.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta aswan riqsisqa kanku.
He's really very smart, you know.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha yachaysapa, yachanki.
So innocent, so good.	Chayna mana huchayoq, chayna allin.
I’m not ready yet.	Manaraqmi listochu kani.
That would have a negative impact.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwanman.
He's not doing too badly.	Payqa manam ancha mana allintachu ruwachkan.
There isn’t much time.	Manan ancha tiempo kanchu.
I’m not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkani.
It's really no big deal, man.	Chiqaptaqa manam hatun ruwaychu, runa.
You look a lot bigger.	Aswan hatunmi rikchakunki.
I can't wait to see it.	Mana suyayta atinichu chayta qawayta.
That’s where you make all the money.	Chaypin llapa qolqeta ruwanki.
Here he will be.	Kaypim payqa kanqa.
He knew this couldn't stop him.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa mana hark’ayta atisqanmanta.
You're not ready, now.	Manam listochu kachkanki, kunanqa.
Now it is almost everywhere.	Kunanqa yaqa llapanpim kachkan.
I'm looking for someone.	Pitapas maskachkani.
The sooner the better.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin kanman.
It’s not like with you.	Manan qanwan hinachu.
As such, it should be considered an insurance transaction.	Chay hinaqa, seguro nisqa ruway hina qhawarisqa kanan.
Maybe he could have done that.	Ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman karqa.
This thing was good.	Kay imapas allinmi karqa.
It wasn't the only thing that was wrong.	Manam chayllachu mana allinchu karqa.
The man in the car.	Carropi kaq runa.
And now a little bit of that, yes.	Hinaspa kunanqa huk chikan chaymanta, arí.
About three o'clock in the morning.	Kimsa pacha tutamanta hina.
I am so glad she had me home with her.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani wasiyman ñuqawan kasqanmanta.
But I think this is the last one.	Ichaqa kaymi qhepa kaq kasqanpi yuyaykuni.
Okay, whatever, no big deal.	Allinmi, imapas, mana hatun ruwaychu.
Not good of me.	Mana allinchu ñuqamanta.
He desperately wanted to win.	Payqa sinchitan atipayta munarqan.
And now maybe you want to be alone.	Hinaspa kunanqa ichapas sapallayki kayta munanki.
He will never do that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas ruwanqachu.
Then it wasn't much better.	Chaymantaqa manam ancha allinchu karqa.
That would have been a bad move.	Chayqa mana allin ruwaymi kanman karqa.
I can do better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinta ruwayta atiyman.
He’s very athletic.	Payqa ancha pukllaqmi.
Like, a .	Imayna, huk .
I thought it was good.	Allinmi kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Now I want to work.	Kunanqa llamkayta munani.
He doesn’t want it the way he wants it.	Manan munayman hinachu munan.
I know how to talk.	Rimayta yachani.
Be mindful of this.	Kaypi yuyayniyuq kay.
I don’t want money from him.	Manam paymanta qullqita munanichu.
They are no longer there.	Manañam chaypichu kanku.
I plan to get out of here.	Kaymanta lluqsiyta yuyaykuni.
He said he couldn't say for sure.	Payqa nirqa mana seguro niyta atisqanmanta.
He said you never did anything.	Paymi nirqa mana haykapipas imatapas ruwasqaykita.
The foolishness continued.	Mana yuyayniyuq kayqa hinallam rirqa.
And time, everywhere.	Hinaspa pacha, maypipas.
It’s easy to do.	Chaylla ruwanapaq hina.
Everyone is happy, tired but happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa, sayk’usqa ichaqa kusisqa.
He is the one who does everything.	Paymi tukuy imatapas ruwan.
Unfortunately, yes.	Llakikuypaqmi, arí.
He thought he would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananpaq.
I have a ?.	Ñuqaqa huk ?.
Or another one.	Utaq huk.
Who was this guy.	Pitaq kay runa karqa.
There, there, now.	Chaypi, chaypi, kunan.
Can do this well.	Kayta allinta ruwayta atinman.
Do this two or three times.	Chaytaqa iskay kutita kimsa kutita ruway.
Another great day.	Huk hatun punchaw.
I can make a new one again.	Hukmanta musuq ruwayta atiyman.
This would be more interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi kanman.
They know something is wrong.	Paykunaqa yachanku imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
The man was well, drunk.	Chay runaqa allin, machasqa kasqa.
No one, really.	Mana pipas, chiqaptapuni.
Alone, it wasn’t.	Sapallan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
No one is that foolish.	Manam pipas chayna mana yuyayniyuqchu.
Go on your own.	Sapallayki riy.
They didn’t seem surprised.	Paykunaqa manan admirasqa hinachu karqanku.
So I was very disappointed.	Chaymi llumpayta hukmanyasqa tarikurqani.
I hold it wasn't.	Ñuqaqa hapini manam karqachu.
And really, they all were.	Hinaspa chiqap, llapallanku karqaku.
It’s easy here.	Kaypiqa facilmi.
So cold and delicious.	Chaymi chiri hinaspa sumaq.
He didn't know why he felt nervous.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku mancharisqa sientekusqanmanta.
But now he was a man.	Kunanmi ichaqa runa kasqa.
She says I know you’ve thought everything through.	Paymi nin yachani tukuy imata allinta yuyaykusqaykita.
But what’s worse.	Ichaqa imataq aswan mana allinqa.
They were not happy at all.	Paykunaqa manan ni imapipas kusisqachu karqanku.
It's like a prisoner.	Chayqa carcelpi kaq runa hinam.
It doesn’t have the same idea.	Mana kikin yuyayniyuqchu.
One more beautiful.	Huk aswan sumaq.
There never was, actually.	Manam haykapipas karqachu, chiqaptaqa.
I couldn’t believe he would do it right away.	Chaylla ruwananta mana creeyta atirqanichu.
Here’s how the process works.	Kaypi imaynataq chay ruwayqa kachkan.
There will be nothing at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imapas kanqachu.
That was outside.	Chayqa hawapi kasqa.
He’s really hurting.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa kashan.
I think we did a great job.	Yuyaykuni hatun llamkayta ruwasqaykumanta.
It was not difficult for me to do.	Manam sasachu karqa ñuqapa ruwayqa.
For now though that is now.	Kunanqa ichaqa chaymi kunan.
Hopefully things work out this time.	Munaymanmi kay kutipi imapas allinta ruwananta.
This would be useful here.	Kayqa kaypiqa allinmi kanman.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
We can never be sure.	Manam haykapipas seguro kayta atichwanchu.
Held in place.	Maypichus kasqanpi hap’isqa.
That’s a good man.	Chayqa allinmi runa.
He really should go.	Payqa chiqaptam rinan.
Here’s why I want to tell you why.	Kaypi imarayku kasqanmanta willayta munani.
Like, really sad.	Imayna, chiqap llakisqa.
I wouldn’t be happy.	Mana kusisqachu kayman.
He was there day and night.	Payqa tuta punchawmi chaypi karqa.
Actually that’s what happened.	Chiqaptaqa chaymi pasarqa.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Ichapas chayna kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want this to happen.	Manam munarqanichu kay pasananta.
That’s not a very good thing.	Chayqa manan ancha allinchu.
There are a lot of people there.	Chaypiqa achka runakunam kachkan.
You want to be the one, you do it.	Munanki chay kaq kayta, qanmi ruwanki.
It was very difficult.	Llumpay sasam karqa.
That’s the best time ever.	Chayqa aswan allin tiempon.
This is not a truly humane learning process.	Kayqa manam runa hina chiqap yachay ruwaychu.
The result is surprisingly good.	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi allin.
Tell us now!.	¡Kunan willay!.
I don't feel very good about this.	Kaymantaqa manam ancha allintachu sientekuni.
I don’t mean to say that.	Mana chaynatachu niyta munani.
But he should not rush them.	Ichaqa manan chaykunataqa usqhayllachu ruwanan.
What came next.	Imataq chaymanta hamurqa.
You are foolish here.	Kaypiqa mana yuyayniyuqmi kachkanki.
I couldn’t help it anymore.	Manañam yanapayta atirqanichu.
If it’s the former, that’s not so good.	Sichus ñawpaq kaq kanman chayqa, chayqa manan ancha allinchu.
He certainly knows about me.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ñoqamanta yachan.
Nothing seemed worried.	Mana imapas llakisqa hinachu karqa.
These were black.	Kaykunaqa yana kasqa.
Otherwise, he would be very seriously injured.	Mana chayqa, payqa ancha sinchitan k’irisqa kanman.
He was so lucky.	Chay hinaqa suerteyoqmi karqan.
Too bad they weren't here right now.	Llakikuypaqmi kunanpacha mana kaypichu karqaku.
That is useless at all.	Chayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu ​​ni imapipas.
This is not like him at all.	Kayqa manan pay hinachu ni imapipas.
I thought that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
Someone said that.	Pipas chayta nisqa.
He really wasn't human at all.	Payqa chiqaptaqa manam runachu karqa ni imapipas.
I’m not happy with that.	Manam chaywanqa kusisqachu kani.
I can probably still hear it.	Kunankamapas yaqapaschá chaytaqa uyarini.
If he does so at that time.	Chay tiempopi chayta ruwan chayqa.
Make it more realistic.	Aswan chiqap ruway.
A few things about what I’m doing now.	Kunan ruwasqaymanta iskay kimsa imakuna.
What’s good, what’s not, and why.	Imataq allin, imataq mana, imaraykutaq.
That was the biggest thing.	Chayqa aswan hatun kaqmi karqan.
There are adults.	Kuraq runakunam kan.
The least important thing.	Aswan pisi importante kaq.
It would be nice to do that.	Chayta ruwayqa sumaqmi kanman.
Again, I doubt it.	Yapamanta iskayrayani.
She said yes she is.	Payqa nirqanmi arí payqa nispa.
But the fact remains that it is uncertain.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi kashan, manan segurochu kashan.
He seems a little nervous.	Payqa huk chikan mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
We are one and the same.	Huk kaqmi kanchik.
So he knew where he was.	Chaymi payqa yacharqa maypi kasqanmanta.
I don’t know why yet, or who.	Manaraqmi yachanichu imarayku, nitaq pitapas.
It all seemed so funny.	Tukuy imapas ancha asikunapaq hinam karqa.
I know you don't want to do that.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwayta munasqaykita.
I hope this helps.	Suyachkani kayqa yanapananta.
That’s surprisingly ineffective.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi mana allintachu ruwan.
We disagree, and that’s fine.	Manam acuerdopichu kayku, chayqa allinmi.
Again, a new moon.	Yapamanta, musuq killa.
And so that was the hardest part.	Hinaspa chaymi chaymi aswan sasa kaq karqa.
A little time of solitude.	Huk pisi pacha sapallan kaymanta.
I wish that was the case.	Chaynatam munayman karqa.
Now, there is.	Kunanqa, kanmi.
All this is completely unique.	Tukuy kaykunaqa tukuy imamanta sapallan kachkan.
I didn’t want to ask him how he knew.	Manam tapuyta munarqanichu imaynata yachasqanmanta.
However, this may not be strictly true.	Ichaqa kayqa manapaschá sinchi cheqaqchu kanman.
It could be you!.	¡Qanmi kanman!.
Which is fine, if you think about it.	Imataq allin, sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
It was cold there.	Chaypiqa chiri kasqa.
Learn to deal with this.	Kayta atipayta yachay.
I was so proud to have him.	Anchatan orgulloso karqani paywan kasqaymanta.
He’s such a good player.	Payqa chayna allin pukllaqmi.
Do you agree with him?.	¿Paywan acuerdopichu kanki?.
He doesn't agree.	Payqa manam acuerdopichu kachkan.
I don’t want to play into it.	Chayman pukllayta mana munanichu.
He couldn’t find the way.	Manas chay ñanta tariyta atirqachu.
So maybe this is doing the right thing.	Chaymi ichapas kayqa allinta ruwachkan.
But this is by no means certain.	Ichaqa manan imapipas segurochu kayqa.
He had a massive head injury.	Payqa hatun uma k’irisqa kasqa.
He always seemed serious, and tired.	Payqa sapa kutim serio hina karqa, hinaspa sayk’usqa.
But, unfortunately, it does.	Ichaqa, llakikuypaqmi, chaytaqa ruwan.
Learn every day.	Sapa punchaw yachay.
But they weren’t really bad guys.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu millay runakuna karqanku.
Isn't anything like it used to be.	Manachu imapas ñawpaq hinachu.
I'm actually kind of excited.	Chiqaptaqa huk laya kusisqam kachkani.
No one should do anything there.	Chaypiqa manam pipas imatapas ruwananchu.
But it’s very, very difficult.	Ichaqa ancha, ancha sasam.
This is the first type.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq laya.
I cannot understand him.	Paytaqa manam entiendeyta atiymanchu.
Maybe he should have.	Ichapas chayta ruwanan kanman karqa.
Goes next, if he's there.	Rin qatiqnin, chaypi kaptinqa.
Or some, anyway.	Utaq wakin, imayna kaptinpas.
You are above all else.	Qamqa tukuy imamanta aswan hatunmi kanki.
It’s not too bad.	Manam ancha mana allinchu kan.
Now they want it.	Kunanqa munanku.
He's doing really well, it's amazing.	Payqa chiqap allintam ruwachkan, admirakuypaqmi.
Be here with me.	Kaypi ñuqawan kay.
She refused to have sex with him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan puñuyta.
Perhaps something is wrong.	Yaqapaschá imapas mana allintachu hapisqa kachkan.
He knows he won’t.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
But here’s the second thing.	Ichaqa kaypi iskay kaq kaq.
Everyone is here tonight.	Lliwmi kunan tuta kaypi kachkanku.
But he refused to be there with her.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu paywan kuska chaypi kayta.
Somewhere that just can't wait.	Maypipas chaylla mana suyayta atinchu.
Can't tell you about this yet.	Manaraqmi kaymanta willayta atinchu.
Now do this.	Kunanqa kayta ruway.
I think that’s a great thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
He was halfway there.	Payqa kuskan kasharqan.
I expect to be disappointed.	Suyachkani hukmanyasqa kayta.
But he was okay with it.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan chaywanqa.
That’s what he did best.	Chaytan aswan allinta ruwarqan.
So here's the thing.	Chaymi kaypi kachkan chay imapas.
And right now, probably just about anyone will.	Hinaspa kunanpacha, yaqapaschá yaqa pipas ruwanqa.
You know, that kid.	Yachanki, chay wawa.
Make it quick, he seemed to say.	Usqhaylla ruway, nispas nisqa hina.
Or something darker, more sinister.	Utaq imapas aswan yana, aswan millay.
I guess I know something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas yachani.
Very, very good thing.	Ancha, ancha allin kaq.
Don’t be a stranger, now.	Ama mana riqsisqa runa kaychu, kunanqa.
Such a practice did not exist at the time.	Chayna ruwayqa manam chay tiempopiqa karqachu.
It would have to be him, after all.	Paymi kanan kanman, tukuy imamanta.
A bit of everything, really.	Huk chikan tukuy imamanta, chiqaptapuni.
You can’t stand it anymore.	Manañam aguantayta atiwaqchu.
He feels discouraged.	Hukmanyasqa hinam tarikun.
Of course, he wasn’t.	Arí, payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But there is something better.	Ichaqa kanmi aswan allin kaq.
And such a one.	Hinaspa chayna huk.
I saw it a second time.	Iskay kaq kutipi rikurqani.
So it’s not worth it to anyone.	Chaymi mana pimanpas valenchu.
I shouldn’t really be here at all.	Manam chiqaptaqa kaypichu kanay ni imapipas.
Two things here.	Iskay imakuna kaypi.
I don’t want to know more about it.	Manam chaymanta astawan yachayta munanichu.
A cold great weather.	Huk chiri hatun pacha.
He had no intention of leaving.	Payqa manan ripuyta yuyaykurqanchu.
Otherwise it was great.	Mana chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I don’t know, maybe.	Manam yachanichu, ichapas.
It looks like that.	Chayna rikchakun.
Yes, something else, not everyone.	Arí, huk imapas, manam llapan runachu.
I always knew it.	Sapa kutim yacharqani.
I have a strong sense of humor.	Sinchi yuyayniyuqmi kani.
People like him know it all the time.	Pay hina runakunaqa sapa kutim chaytaqa yachanku.
A man speaks and acts.	Huk runa riman, ruwan ima.
They seem happier.	Aswan kusisqa hinam kanku.
The man continued.	Chay runaqa hinallam nirqa.
He had no reason not to, after all.	Payqa manan imaraykupas karqanchu mana ruwananpaq, tukuy imamanta.
I feel like a fool.	Sonso hinam tarikuni.
He stayed the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon qhepakurqan.
That he could well believe.	Allinta creeyta atisqanmanta.
It was clear he never would.	Sut’inmi karqan mana hayk’aqpas ruwananta.
It’s easy to do.	Chaylla ruwanapaq.
Nobody, but nobody.	Mana pipas, ichaqa mana pipas.
He'll never be like you.	Manan hayk'aqpas qan hinaqa kanqachu.
In the other world.	Huknin pachapi.
But, this is the reality.	Ichaqa, kaymi cheqaq kaq.
He took the first step.	Paymi ñawpaq kaq ruwayta ruwarqa.
Now, this is very important to me.	Kunanqa, kayqa ancha allinmi ñuqapaq.
But now he couldn't sit still.	Ichaqa kunanqa manañam tiyayta atirqachu.
You weren’t good enough’.	Mana allinchu karqanki’.
And he did a great job.	Hinaspa hatun llamkayta ruwarqa.
The easiest thing to do.	Aswan facil ruway.
But the truth was much simpler.	Ichaqa cheqaq kaqmi aswan facil karqan.
He probably wants to buy someone a gift.	Payqa yaqapaschá pimanpas regalota rantiyta munan.
Great, great, seriously great.	Hatun, hatun, serio hatun.
It was so amazing!.	¡Ancha admirakuypaqmi karqa!.
But never in a hurry.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu.
He did, in fact.	Chaynatam ruwarqa, chiqaptaqa.
It’s not good for anything.	Imapaqpas allinchu.
These are the best.	Kaykunaqa aswan allinmi.
He doesn’t know or care who he is.	Payqa manan yachanchu nitaq imananpaschu pi kasqanmantaqa.
I have no idea how it happened.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imayna pasasqanmanta.
Every player should do this.	Sapa pukllaqmi kayta ruwanan.
Other than that, the process was successful.	Mana chaymantaqa, chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
But I don’t know why.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku chayta.
Can’t wait for what’s coming.	Mana suyayta atinchu imachus hamunanta.
We’ve all done it before.	Llapanchismi ñawpaqtaqa ruwarqayku.
The night passed.	Tuta pasarqa.
I don’t care how it is for you.	Manan imananpaschu imaynatas qanpaq kashan chaytaqa.
You have to do it, he said.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki, nispas nisqa.
Terrified of everything.	Tukuy imamanta mancharisqa.
They’re extremely serious.	Paykunaqa sinchi serio kanku.
This was the same as before.	Kayqa ñawpaqpi hinam karqa.
Something seemed really wrong.	Imapas chiqap mana allin hinam karqa.
He opened the other door.	Huknin punkuta kicharirqa.
I think that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
He had been a lonely man for a long time.	Unayñan sapallan runa kasqa.
I know you can handle it better than I can.	Yachanim ñuqamanta aswan allinta manejayta atisqaykita.
Being foolish and foolish.	Mana yuyayniyuq kaspa, mana yuyayniyuq kaspa ima.
It’s not quite right.	Manam allintachu.
I am so sorry about everything.	Anchatam llakikuni tukuy imamanta.
Like, somebody is doing this.	Imayna, wakin runa kayta ruwachkan.
She was terrified he would find out.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan chayta yachananta.
It’s still a big deal.	Kunankamapas hatun ruwaymi.
I want to be known for doing the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruwasqaymanta riqsisqa kaytam munani.
He was genuinely frightened.	Cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa karqan.
One of them is really big.	Hukninmi chiqap hatun.
Or at least, don’t actually do the deed.	Utaq aswanpas, ama chiqamanta ruwaychu chay ruwayta.
He said he was sure.	Payqa seguro kasqanmantam nirqa.
It was beautiful, as always.	Sumaqmi karqa, sapa kuti hina.
I’m more unsure.	Aswan mana segurochu kani.
He thought, maybe that’s the best way.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi, ichapas chay aswan allinqa kanman.
This is not a very common practice.	Kayqa manam ancha riqsisqa ruwaychu.
There really could be a lot of things.	Chiqaptam achka imakuna kanman.
So, he knows everything.	Chaymi, payqa tukuy imatapas yachan.
He can't go.	Payqa manam riyta atinmanchu.
So far I am very happy with it.	Kunankamaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani chaywan.
Instead, there are two possibilities.	Aswanpas iskay ruwaymi kanman.
No one could remember.	Manam pipas yuyariyta atirqachu.
That is not the case with me.	Ñoqawanqa manan chay hinachu.
Today was a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allin punchawmi karqa.
This was it, man.	Kaymi karqan, runa.
It would be nice again.	Yapamanta sumaqmi kanman.
He was there the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chaypi karqan.
Obviously it’s not true.	Sut’inmi mana cheqaqchu.
He had wanted it for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chayta munarqan.
I know for a fact.	Yachanim huk chiqap kaqta.
But he was certainly serious.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin payqa serio karqan.
He didn’t want to tell her anything, obviously.	Manas imatapas willayta munarqanchu, sut’inmi.
He never really went to school.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu escuelaman rirqan.
Everything is almost too good to be true.	Tukuy imapas yaqa ancha allinmi.
But no, this wasn’t enough yet.	Ichaqa manan, kayqa manaraqmi allinchu karqan.
Now it’s gone.	Kunanqa manaña kanchu.
And that goes all the way.	Hinaspa chaymi tukuy ñanta rin.
He knew exactly what was going on.	Payqa allintam yacharqa imakuna pasasqanmanta.
It will be easier for you.	Aswan facilmi kanqa qampaq.
He cannot be evicted from his home.	Payqa manan wasinman qarqosqa kayta atinmanchu.
At least it was a good night.	Aswanpas allin tutan karqan.
I couldn't see this.	Kaytaqa manam rikuyta atirqanichu.
I'm tired, hungry and scared.	Sayk'usqa, yarqasqa, mancharisqa ima kachkani.
He wished he wouldn't.	Munarqa mana chayta ruwananta.
He didn’t know how to stop it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imayna hark’ayta.
He said that to someone.	Chaynatam nirqa pitapas.
It is the safest way to do this.	Chaypaqqa aswan seguro ruwaymi.
Now I know that’s not the case.	Kunanqa yachanin mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I was excited all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi kusisqa karqani.
I think he looks good.	Allin rikchayniyuq kasqanmantam piensani.
This was the first challenge.	Kaymi ñawpaq kaq sasachakuy karqa.
He was in the house.	Payqa chay wasipi kasqa.
Many, many people here.	Achka, achka runakuna kaypi.
We had to do that earlier.	Chaytaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi ruwanayku karqa.
He asked her to hurry up, and she said yes.	Payqa usqhaylla ruwananpaqmi nirqan, hinan payqa nirqan.
He still wasn't sure how he felt about it.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasharqan chaymanta imayna sientekusqanmanta.
I always have been.	Ñoqaqa sapa kutillanmi karqani.
He wants to be sure.	Payqa munanmi seguro kayta.
It was a real together moment.	Chiqap kuska kay rato karqa.
First, make a good cup of coffee.	Ñawpaqtaqa allin kukata ruway.
Learn the truth.	Chiqap kaqta yachay.
There are so many more of us.	Anchatam aswan achka kanchik.
Nothing is right.	Manan imapas allinchu.
He acted like he was caught.	Payqa hap’isqa hinan ruwarqan.
That is the most important thing to do.	Chayta ruwaymi ancha allinqa.
Maybe he should have gone at someone’s suggestion.	Ichapas pipas nisqanman hina rinan karqa.
Being an adult is not easy.	Kuraq runa kayqa manam facilchu.
It is good and beautiful.	Allin hinaspa sumaqmi kan.
It’s good to be with you.	Allinmi qanwan kayqa.
It requires a good sense of humor.	Allin yuyayniyuq kaytam munan.
I don’t want to think or talk about it.	Manam chaymantaqa yuyaymanayta nitaq rimayta munanichu.
And then you knew.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa yacharqanki.
That cost me money.	Chayqa qullqita quwarqa.
It was like he was scared of me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta mancharisqa hinam karqa.
I always want to learn or do something.	Sapa kutim imatapas yachayta utaq ruwayta munani.
What am I going to do.	Imatam ruwasaq.
Everyone was hungry.	Lliwmi yarqaymanta karqaku.
He was with me all evening.	Payqa tukuy chisi ñuqawan kachkarqa.
I would like to know the best way to do this.	Kayta ruwanapaq aswan allin ruwayta yachayta munani.
But one last time.	Ichaqa huk qhepa kutipi.
I always feel very tired.	Sapa kutim ancha sayk’usqa tarikuni.
But this is later.	Ichaqa kayqa qhepamanmi.
But the old man knew.	Ichaqa chay kuraq runaqa yacharqanmi.
He was more tired than hungry.	Payqa yarqaymanta aswan sayk’usqa kasqa.
The name says it all.	Sutinmi tukuy chayta nin.
I am outside every day.	Sapa punchawmi hawapi kachkani.
It’s with me.	Ñoqawanmi kachkan.
Yes, that is what he had to do.	Arí, chaytan ruwanan karqan.
If not, please specify your preferences.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa willay imakuna munasqaykita.
Now it will be yours.	Kunanqa qampaq kanqa.
That was everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas karqa.
Now be quick.	Kunanqa utqaylla kay.
This happened rather quickly.	Kayqa aswan utqayllam pasarqa.
Everything will be fine from here.	Kaymantaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
Not there for him anymore.	Manaña chaypichu paypaq.
But at the time, we didn’t care.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan imananpaschu kayku.
Good, bad, ugly.	Allin, mana allin, millay.
This shouldn't be difficult.	Kayqa manam sasachu kanan.
That was in high school.	Chayqa karqan colegiopi.
It was all this.	Tukuy kaymi karqan.
Nothing here yet.	Manaraqmi kaypi imapas.
I meant, that’s all.	Niyta munarqani, chaylla.
I have never seen one in action.	Manam haykapipas hukta ruwaypi rikurqanichu.
He was an outcast.	Payqa huk llaqtamanta qarqusqa runam karqa.
It was there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi kasqa.
I was very tired.	Ancha sayk'usqañan karqani.
They were always like this.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim kayna karqaku.
He couldn't say more.	Manas astawan niyta atirqachu.
By now it probably was.	Kunankamaqa yaqapaschá karqan.
That it wasn’t good for him.	Paypaq mana allin kasqanmanta.
I don’t know how to fix this.	Manam yachanichu kayta allichayta.
And that, is so bad in this world.	Hinaspa chaymi, kay pachapi ancha mana allinqa.
Recently.	Chayllaraq.
Still, he could not answer.	Chayna kaptinpas manam kutichiyta atirqachu.
He looked tired and exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa hinan karqan.
He may never want to be.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas kayta munanmanchu.
Very hard, they were.	Ancha sinchi, paykunaqa karqanku.
Nothing, then .	Mana imapas, chaymanta .
More than he was worried.	Aswan llakisqa kasqanmantaqa.
He was cold, cold and hungry.	Payqa chiri, chiri, yarqasqa ima kasqa.
Here’s the latest one.	Kaypi kachkan chay qhipa kaq.
I didn’t really know where to go.	Manam allintachu yacharqani mayman rinaypaq.
I mean, what could have been why.	Niyta munani, imataq kanman karqan imarayku.
Now there was this stranger.	Kunanqa kay mana riqsisqa runa kasqa.
This would be the case.	Kayta ruwanman.
I want to live there.	Chaypi tiyayta munani.
So you think about it a bit.	Chaymi huk chhikanta yuyaykunki.
And, they were proud of it.	Hinaspa, chaymanta orgulloso karqanku.
He goes to school.	Yachay wasiman rin.
You can’t say anything to him.	Manam paytaqa imatapas niyta atiwaqchu.
After that, he fails again.	Chay qhepamanmi yapamanta mana allintachu ruwan.
Still, he was not happy.	Chayna kaptinpas manam kusisqachu karqa.
Not a house.	Mana huk wasi.
I was yours, once.	Ñuqaqa qampaq karqani, huk kuti.
Not much anymore.	Manaña anchatachu.
There is a reality to that.	Chayqa kanmi cheqaq kaq.
Very nice weather.	Ancha sumaq pacha.
She loves to see him.	Payqa anchatam munan payta qawayta.
He's really popular.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha riqsisqa.
Everyone wants to get somewhere fast.	Lliwmi munanku maymanpas chaylla chayayta.
That was actually pretty interesting.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
And then, something that happened to him.	Hinaspa chaymanta, imapas paywan pasasqanmanta.
Every day is difficult.	Sapa punchawmi sasa.
He's the one who's injured.	Paymi k'irisqa.
I heard a lot about it.	Achkatam chaymanta uyarirqani.
Halfway house.	Kuskan wasi.
Here are ten of us.	Kaypi chunka kanchik.
This is the one.	Kayqa chay.
I didn’t think much of it.	Mana anchatachu chaypi yuyaykurqani.
And he went with him.	Hinan paywan kuska rirqan.
Not now though.	Mana kunan ichaqa.
It was very early, after all.	Ancha temprano karqan, tukuy imamanta.
It just seemed like the way to do it.	Chayqa chay ruwanapaq hinallam rikchakurqa.
Someone was always getting hurt.	Pipas sapa kutim k’irisqa kachkarqa.
He didn't look like he was drunk.	Payqa manam machasqa hinachu rikchakurqa.
That may not have been true.	Chayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu karqan.
That’s a big deal though.	Chayqa hatun ruwaymi ichaqa.
Yesterday doesn't matter.	Qayna punchawqa manam imapaqpas valenchu.
I can't find anyway to do this.	Manam tarinichu imayna kaptinpas kayta ruwanaypaq.
Like, very wrong.	Imayna, ancha pantasqa.
Me, a stranger at the time.	Ñuqa, chay pacha mana riqsisqa runa.
That’s why it took so long.	Chayraykum ancha unayta pasarqa.
And so she agrees.	Hinaspa chaymi payqa arí nin.
Then the truth.	Chaymanta chiqap.
I know it happened too late.	Yachanim ancha tarde pasasqanmanta.
I can tell him this.	Paytaqa kaytam niyta atiyman.
He couldn't take this.	Payqa manam kayta hapiyta atirqachu.
That meant if this was good, it could come again.	Chayqa niyta munarqa sichus kay allin kanman chayqa, hukmanta hamuyta atinman.
I'm very happy, I mean.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani, niyta munani.
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantam anchata kusikuni.
She was more beautiful now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan sumaqmi kasqa.
So here you are, you are a human being.	Chaymi kaypi kachkanki, runam kanki.
It’s been three years.	Kimsa watañam kachkan.
It was not easy as to why.	Imarayku kasqanmantaqa manam facilchu karqa.
I want him to know this.	Kayta yachananta munani.
True this time.	Chiqap kay kutipi.
That’s the big secret.	Chayqa hatun pakasqa kaqmi.
But that means go first.	Ichaqa chaymi niyta munan ñawpaqta riy.
It won’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanqa.
I did this job the night before.	Kay llamk’ayta ruwarqani ñawpaq tuta.
He knew he wouldn't be back now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan mana kutimunanta.
Good for you, actually.	Allinmi qanpaq, cheqaqtapuni.
I don’t want to be second.	Manam iskay kaq kayta munanichu.
That, however, makes no sense.	Chaywanmi ichaqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
This is the newest one.	Kayqa aswan musuq kaqmi.
There were a lot of new people there.	Chaypin askha mosoq runakuna karqan.
They were both exhausted.	Iskayninkum sayk’usqa karqaku.
He couldn't understand why.	Payqa manan entiendeyta atirqanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
And that’s just what we’re here to do.	Hinaspa chaylla kaypi kachkaniku ruwanaykupaq.
But this looks interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
What a wicked man.	Ima millay runa.
I don’t feel so bad about it.	Manam chayna mana allintachu chaymantaqa sientekuni.
Very nice second and third for sure.	Ancha sumaq iskay kaq kimsa kaq seguro.
Repeat the process.	Chayta yapamanta ruway.
I didn’t mean to say no to that.	Manam chayta mana niyta munarqanichu.
But this is not the only, isolated evil.	Ichaqa manan kayqa sapallanchu, sapallan millay ruwaychu.
But it’s really hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa.
He got it a month later.	Payqa huk killa qhepamanmi chayta hap’irqan.
Nobody likes it.	Manam pimanpas gustanchu.
I think people mean well.	Yuyaykuni runakuna allinta niyta munanku.
Safer for him that way.	Aswan seguro paypaq chay hina.
So, if there is one, here it is.	Chaymi, sichus kanman chayqa, kaypim kachkan.
said one of them.	nispas huknin nisqa.
He hasn’t done that yet.	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwanchu.
Yes, it was him.	Arí, paymi karqa.
He'd better find out soon.	Aswan allinmi kanman chaylla chayta yachananpaq.
It would be a non-action.	Mana ruwaymi kanman.
That was certainly the first step.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq kaq ruway karqan.
That’s the way it is.	Chay hina.
He did a good job.	Allin llamkayta ruwarqa.
Like me, but not that bad.	Ñoqa hina, ichaqa manan chay hina mana allinchu.
I wanted to hear more.	Astawan uyariyta munarqani.
I wasn't supposed to be good at it either.	Ñuqapas manam chaypiqa allinchu kanay karqa.
I still do, actually.	Hinallam ruwani, chiqaptaqa.
I wonder what’s wrong with him.	Tapukuni imataq paywan kachkan nispa.
But that will happen in the end.	Ichaqa chaymi kanqa tukukuypi.
I'm serious, man.	Serio kani, runa.
He said he didn’t know.	Payqa manan yachanichu nispas nisqa.
He thought he did.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwasqanpi.
Maybe you don’t know you don’t.	Ichapas mana yachankichu mana ruwasqaykita.
That’s probably what he said.	Chayqa yaqapaschá nirqa.
That’s what he said.	Chayqa nisqa.
You can do that today.	Kunan punchawmi chaytaqa ruwawaq.
Me or he is.	Ñuqapas icha paymi.
She would be nice if she wasn't so ugly.	Payqa sumaqmi kanman mana chayna millay kaptinqa.
That’s why it exists.	Chayraykum kachkan.
It was a one-time event.	Huk kutilla ruwaymi karqan.
I had no idea it would be so famous today.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu karqani kunan punchaw chayna riqsisqa kananta.
But that’s a lot bigger.	Ichaqa chayqa aswan hatunmi.
Tell me later.	Qhepaman willaway.
There can be a lot of discomfort.	Achka mana allin kaymi kanman.
I have a bad attitude.	Mana allin yuyayniyuqmi kani.
It’s been there for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kashan.
That wasn’t a bad thing at all.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu karqan ni imapipas.
You will do very well here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwanki.
He stayed there for a month.	Chaypin huk killa qhepakurqan.
This happened and then this happened.	Kayqa pasarqa chaymanta kay pasarqa.
An earlier one then almost worse.	Huk ñawpaq chaymanta yaqa aswan mana allin.
Yes, a good person is good.	Arí, allin runa allinmi.
It was a good year.	Allin wata karqa.
He knows how he wants to fix it.	Payqa yachanmi imayna allichayta munasqanmanta.
So maybe that phrase doesn’t apply here.	Chaymi ichapas chay rimayqa mana kaypiqa allinchu.
He wished he had done it more often.	Payqa munarqanmi aswan askha kutita chayta ruwananta.
I hope everything will be fine.	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananta.
Still, he felt uncomfortable.	Chayna kaptinpas mana allintam tarikurqa.
He wasn't sure he wanted to know.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan yachay munasqanmanta.
Hopefully everything goes well.	Munaymanmi tukuy ima allin kananpaq.
Know, stop doing it.	Yachay, amaña ruwaychu.
Everyone is busy now.	Kunanqa llapallankum ocupasqa kachkanku.
What is it, he said.	Imataq, nispa.
This will be yours, he says.	Kayqa qampaq kanqa, nispas nin.
I didn't agree with that.	Chaytaqa manam acuerdopichu karqani.
Maybe one day, someone will.	Ichapas huk punchaw, pipas ruwanqa.
If this is this, then this is what he can do.	Sichus kay kay kanman chayqa, chaymantaqa kaytan ruwayta atinman.
I think you did a great job.	Yuyaykuni ancha hatun llamkayta ruwasqaykita.
It wasn't like he wasn't coming.	Manam karqachu mana hamuq hinachu.
But that is not the case today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
But he couldn’t stay angry.	Ichaqa manan phiñasqa qhepakuyta atirqanchu.
He was easy to communicate with.	Paywan rimayqa facilmi karqa.
Don’t forget that we have to do that right away.	Ama qunqaychu chaytaqa chaylla ruwanayku kasqanmanta.
Why he never wanted to talk after that.	Imaraykun mana hayk’aqpas chay qhepaman rimayta munarqanchu.
Learn to communicate with us.	Ñoqaykuwan rimayta yachay.
It would be great to talk to you.	Ancha allinmi kanman qanwan rimanaypaq.
I don’t want him in jail.	Manam munanichu carcelpi kananta.
But he couldn’t the following week.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu qatiqnin semanapi.
This is a good thing, he says.	Kayqa allinmi, nispas nin.
I thought long and hard about that.	Chaypin unayta sinchita yuyaykurqani.
He will build a house.	Wasi ruwanqa.
I need something better.	Aswan allintam necesitasaq.
He would be really, really busy.	Payqa chiqap, chiqap ocupasqa kanman.
Everyone is frustrated.	Lliwmi hukmanyasqa kachkanku.
I was hurt, yes.	K’irisqa karqani, arí.
There are good people there.	Chaypim allin runakuna kachkan.
Something told him not to go there.	Imapas nirqam chayman ama rinanpaq.
Time does it.	Tiempo ruwan.
Indeed, he said.	Chiqamanta, nispa.
Actually, that would make sense.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa allin yuyayniyuqmi kanman.
Worst of all it makes no sense.	Aswan mana allinqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
If anyone can do that.	Sichus pipas chayta ruwayta atinman chayqa.
If this had happened, great.	Sichus kay kanman karqan chayqa, hatunmi.
I need to do this quickly.	Kayta utqaylla ruwanay tiyan.
I need to go home.	Wasiman riyta necesitasaq.
You can't understand, he said.	Mana entiendeyta atiwaqchu, nispa.
You can’t do that to him.	Chaytaqa manan paytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
We strongly disagree.	Sinchitan mana acuerdopichu kayku.
They want it there.	Chaypim munanku.
He knows a lot about it.	Payqa anchatam yachan.
There really is no reason for it.	Chiqaptaqa manam imaraykupas chaypaqqa kanchu.
I was like a child.	Wawa hinam karqani.
This is never true.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqchu.
Something seemed wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allin hinam karqa.
I know it's ugly now.	Yachanim kunan millay kasqanmanta.
Being human is a bad thing.	Runa kayqa mana allin ruwaymi.
It is the next step in the process.	Chay ruwaypi qatiqnin ruwaymi.
He wants to, but he can’t.	Payqa munanmi, ichaqa manan atinchu.
He went to the house.	Chay wasiman rirqa.
And that it would happen once in a while.	Hinaspa huk kutilla imapas kananta.
I didn’t expect that.	Manam suyarqanichu chaytaqa.
We’re about ten of us.	Chunka hinam kanchik.
If there was no other, there was one.	Mana huk kaq kaptinqa huk kaqmi karqa.
It worked out very well.	Ancha allintam lluqsirqa.
The resident refused.	Chay llaqtapi tiyaq runaqa manan munarqanchu.
That’s what I mean here.	Chaynatam kaypi niyta munani.
I don’t want to make it too long.	Manam ancha unaytachu ruwayta munani.
But that is the worst part of it.	Ichaqa chaymi aswan mana allin ruwayqa.
He looks happy.	Payqa kusisqam rikchakun.
He doesn’t want her to repeat the last time.	Payqa manan munanchu qhepa kutita yapamanta ruwananta.
That he could ask her what to do.	Ima ruwananta tapuyta atisqanmanta.
Neither is the john.	Nitaq chay john.
I can't remember how long.	Manam yuyariyta atinichu hayka unayta.
I didn’t think of anything.	Manam imatapas piensarqanichu.
He couldn't think.	Mana yuyayniyuq kayta atirqachu.
He’s the one who passed.	Paymi pasarqa.
He couldn’t make sense of it at all.	Payqa manan imapipas allinta entiendeyta atirqanchu.
What would be a .	Imataq kanman huk .
Very good knowledge.	Ancha allin yachay.
I really want you to be there.	Anchatam munani chaypi kasqaykita.
I didn’t think about it.	Mana chaypichu yuyaykurqani.
A person can be happy for no reason.	Huk runaqa mana imaraykupas kusisqam kanman.
I'd rather be here.	Aswan allinmi kaypi kachkani.
It was about a month ago.	Yaqa huk killa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
But he knew nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanchu.
It was worse now.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinchu kasqa.
He has recently .	Payqa chayllaraqmi .
I am very sorry about that.	Anchatam chaymanta llakikuni.
It may be just the right time to celebrate.	Yaqapaschá chayllaraq kanman fiestata ruwanapaq.
Now, if you’re ready .	Kunanqa, listoña kashanki chayqa .
They are big, they are fast.	Hatunmi kanku, utqayllam kanku.
Actually, it’s the right thing to do.	Chiqaptaqa, allin ruwaymi.
Certainly some wretched people.	Chiqamanta wakin llakisqa runakuna.
I still do that to this day.	Kunankamapas chaynatam ruwani.
Everything else perhaps.	Tukuy imapas ichapas.
It's a cause for injury.	Chayqa k'irisqa kananpaqmi.
It’s not safe at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu.
You have always been like that.	Qamqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqanki.
No coffee for you.	Mana kukata qampaq.
Now be there for you.	Kunanqa qanpaq chaypi kay.
I used to do everything for him.	Ñawpaqtaqa tukuy imatam paypaq ruwaq kani.
You know exactly who they are.	Allintam yachanki pikuna kasqankuta.
You’re a human being, too.	Qampas runam kanki.
He wants to make money.	Payqa qullqita tariyta munan.
But he didn’t know all of that.	Ichaqa manan tukuy chaykunataqa yacharqanchu.
He doesn't seem happy to be here.	Payqa manam kusisqachu rikchakun kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
What do you know that he didn’t?.	¿Imatataq yachanki mana chayta ruwasqanmanta?.
I have no idea why that is.	Manam yuyayniyuqchu kani imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
Probably the best way to do this.	Yaqapaschá aswan allinqa kayta ruwanapaq.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Chaywanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
Nothing works as well as too much.	Manan imapas llumpay hinaqa allintachu ruwan.
He hopes he doesn't.	Payqa suyanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
I feel bad for anyone to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwananpaqmi mana allintachu sientekuni.
He was very happy.	Ancha kusisqa karqan.
Can't say why.	Mana imarayku niyta atinchu.
But he said he didn't want to see her anymore.	Ichaqa nirqanmi manaña rikuyta munasqanmanta.
Same problem every time.	Kikin sasachakuy sapa kuti.
They were really huge.	Chiqaptam hatun hatun karqaku.
I think that's where it's at.	Chayqa chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
If there are some.	Wakin kaptinqa.
He is a very genuine person.	Payqa ancha chiqap runam.
And tell me now.	Hinaspa kunan willaway.
I want to know what it looks like.	Imayna rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
He couldn’t keep up.	Payqa manan chayman hina puriyta atirqanchu.
Now he did that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwarqa.
He may not be saying the right thing.	Manapaschá allintachu rimachkan.
I did for a while too.	Ñoqapas huk tiempon ruwarqani.
Better, but not much better.	Aswan allin, ichaqa manan ancha allinchu.
One or more.	Huk utaq achka.
But that won’t happen, probably.	Ichaqa manan chayqa kanqachu, yaqapaschá.
I think it’s you.	Yuyaykuni qam kasqaykita.
That means you’re pretty awesome.	Chayqa niyta munan, ancha manchay kasqaykita.
Three quick ones.	Kimsa utqaylla.
Everyone here knows what he can do.	Kaypiqa llapallankum yachanku ima ruway atisqanmanta.
He said the truth.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin nirqan.
He did a lot of walking.	Achka puriyta ruwarqa.
I'll be happy to do that for you.	Kusisqam chayta ruwasaq qampaq.
I didn’t know how to sit down.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna tiyayta.
He has everything he wants.	Payqa tukuy ima munasqanman hinam kachkan.
I didn’t want to take a chance.	Manam huk oportunidadta hapiyta munarqanichu.
He played there all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi pukllaq.
It was good, but earlier.	Allinmi karqa, ichaqa ñawpaqtaraqmi.
This is perhaps the biggest problem.	Kayqa ichapas aswan hatun sasachakuy.
That was a big deal at the time.	Chayqa chay tiempopiqa hatun ruwaymi karqa.
Everything would be better very soon.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam aswan allin kanman.
He knows exactly where he needs to be.	Payqa allintam yachan maypi kananta.
But do it regularly.	Ichaqa sapa kutilla ruway.
Indeed, he has said this to me many times.	Cheqaqtapunin askha kutipi chayta niwarqan.
Seems like yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi rikchakun.
He wanted to know what had happened and why.	Payqa yachayta munarqa imakuna pasasqanmanta hinaspa imanasqa kasqanmanta.
This is what they know.	Kaytam yachanku.
I'm really glad it turned out.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
Tell me how it happened.	Willaway imayna pasasqanmanta.
What a great achievement!.	¡Ima hatun ruwaymi!.
He was really stupid.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sonso kasqa.
You want the best person to win.	Aswan allin runa atipananta munanki.
Not worse than that.	Mana chaymanta aswan mana allinchu.
More than that, actually.	Aswan chaymanta, chiqaptaqa.
It just happened at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chayllam pasarqa.
In fact, you probably do.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanki.
People are not worth anything.	Runakunaqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
I don’t have that answer either.	Ñoqapas manan chay kutichiyta tarinichu.
You’re going to go.	Qamqa rinki.
He just opened everything up.	Chaylla tukuy imata kicharirqa.
But maybe that doesn’t make any sense.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa mana imapaqpas valenchu.
He couldn't get there in time anyway.	Imayna kaptinpas manam chaymanqa tiempollanpi chayayta atinmanchu karqa.
So that wouldn't be really good.	Chaymi chayqa mana chiqap allinchu kanman.
This had to be something, something, something else.	Kayqa imapas, imapas, huk kaqmi kanan karqa.
This is what it was now.	Kaymi kunan kasqa.
You can’t be here, you know.	Manam kaypi kayta atiwaqchu, yachanki.
He always knew when it was.	Payqa sapa kutim yacharqa haykapi chayna kasqanmanta.
He wants to fix this.	Payqa kayta allichayta munan.
It’s not that very difficult.	Manam chayna ancha sasachu.
He wasn’t quite being himself.	Payqa manan allintachu pay kikin kasharqan.
I couldn’t stand it.	Manam chaytaqa aguantayta atirqanichu.
I'm sure it's all nothing.	Seguro kani tukuy imapas mana ima kasqanmanta.
Those two people, that is.	Chay iskay runakuna, chaymi.
And it would be better.	Hinaspa aswan allinqa kanman.
A successful one, for sure.	Huk allin ruwaq, seguro.
So very, very sad.	Chaymi ancha, ancha llakisqa.
He knew that all too well.	Chaytaqa llumpay allintam yacharqa.
You want to be out in the open.	Hawapi hawapi kayta munanki.
So it’s fucking good.	Chaymi millay allin.
First of all, it’s beautiful.	Ñawpaqtaqa, sumaqmi.
That was always better.	Chayqa sapa kutim aswan allin karqa.
But that is not the only thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayllachu ruwana.
He wouldn’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwanmanchu.
If we disagree, we disagree.	Mana acuerdopichu kanchik chayqa, manam acuerdopichu kanchik.
I couldn’t come up with anything.	Manam imatapas hamuyta atirqanichu.
I like that quite a bit.	Chayqa allintam gustan.
He is the strong one.	Paymi chay sinchi kaq.
Obviously, he didn’t.	Sut’inmi, manan chaytachu ruwarqan.
Maybe it’s like here somewhere.	Ichapas kaypi kanman hina maypipas.
This has happened before.	Kayqa ñawpaqtaraqmi karqa.
That was a few years ago now.	Chayqa iskay kinsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi karqan kunanqa.
We all don’t have that.	Llapanchismi mana chaytachu.
But tell me, please.	Ichaqa willaway, ama hina kaspa.
John is right here.	Juanqa kaypiqa allintam rimachkan.
It doesn’t matter about anything.	Manam imamantapas imananpaschu.
I hope you are very busy.	Suyachkani ancha ocupasqa kasqaykita.
For a long time he was something else.	Unayñan payqa huk imapas karqan.
He had all the time.	Tukuy tiempon paypaq karqan.
He was long gone.	Payqa unayñan manaña karqanchu.
I don’t know either.	Ñuqapas manam yachanichu.
We are smarter people.	Aswan yachaysapa runakunam kanchik.
He wanted to know that was true.	Payqa chay cheqaq kasqanmantan yachayta munarqan.
I don't really remember this.	Kaymantaqa manam chiqap yuyarinichu.
And you’ll be with him.	Hinaspa paywan kanki.
I'm sure you are too.	Seguro kani qampas chayna kasqanmanta.
I know you are great.	Yachanim hatun kasqaykita.
He knew the right way to do it.	Chaypaqqa allintam yacharqa.
Yes, you are right.	Arí allintam kanki.
Three thirty.	Kimsa kimsa chunka.
I certainly think so, yes.	Chiqamanta chayta yuyani, arí.
Immediately next time.	Chaylla qatiqnin kutipi.
Wouldn’t that be ridiculous.	¿Manachu chayqa asikunapaq hina kanman.
Tell me everything you know about everything.	Tukuy imamanta tukuy yachasqaykita willaway.
Maybe in the winter.	Ichapas chiri tiempopi.
He was fast but almost too fast.	Payqa usqhayllan ichaqa yaqa nishuta usqhaylla ruwaq.
Alone in the whole world.	Tukuy pachapi sapallan.
Everyone had to be alone.	Lliwmi sapallan kanan karqa.
You can’t come here again.	Manan hukmanta kayman hamuyta atiwaqchu.
The girl was seriously injured.	Chay sipasmi sinchita k’irisqa kasqa.
I was always so proud of him.	Sapa kutim paymanta chayna orgulloso karqani.
That’s a good thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa allinmi.
Please say that.	Ama hina kaspa chayta niy.
I’ll be in the hospital tomorrow.	Paqarin hospitalpi kasaq.
That day, it happened.	Chay punchawmi, chayna pasarqa.
And they get sadder and sadder.	Hinaspa aswan llakisqa, aswan llakisqa ima kanku.
The next thing he knew he had to be right there.	Qatiqnin kaqmi yacharqa chaypi allinta kananta.
I wonder if he is speaking well of her.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus paymanta allintachu rimachkan.
Do a little shopping.	Huk chhikanta rantiyta ruway.
Maybe how and why.	Ichapas imayna hinaspa imaraykupas.
Instead, he seemed disappointed.	Aswanpas hukmanyasqa hinam karqa.
He could not predict the future.	Hamuq tiempopi imachus kananta mana niyta atirqanchu.
He doesn’t want to hear anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas uyariyta munanchu.
I don’t want to talk to him.	Manam paywan rimayta munanichu.
Almost everything was great.	Yaqa tukuy imapas hatunmi karqa.
Maybe he won’t do anything.	Ichapas mana ima ruwaytapas ruwanqachu.
What is this? 	Imataq kay?
I hear something.	Imatapas uyarini.
It would be very, very fast.	Ancha ancha utqaylla kanman.
And that’s the house.	Hinaspa chay wasi.
I usually want to leave again.	Yaqa llapanpim hukmanta ripuyta munani.
They weren’t ready for that yet.	Chaypaqqa manaraqmi listochu karqanku.
You can't go out there now.	Kunanqa manam chaymanqa lluqsiyta atiwaqchu.
Maybe a week, ten days.	Ichapas huk semana, chunka punchaw.
Now, here's the thing.	Kunanqa, kaypi kachkan chay imapas.
No one wanted to talk much.	Manam pipas anchatachu rimayta munarqa.
I thought it was a bit excessive.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani.
But I really want to know.	Ichaqa anchatan munani chayta yachayta.
I don’t want to hear about it anymore.	Manañam chaymantaqa uyariyta munanichu.
So, be nice.	Chaymi, sumaq kay.
That would have been better at least.	Chayqa aswanpas allinmi kanman karqan.
That night.	Chay tutaqa.
He didn’t look good though.	Payqa manan allintachu qhawarisqa ichaqa.
I know exactly what is coming.	Allintam yachani imakuna hamunanta.
That’s how you learned.	Chaynatam yacharqanki.
But after a while, it stopped being funny.	Ichaqa huk tiempo qhepamanmi manaña asikunapaq hinachu karqan.
This is the last chance.	Kaymi qhipa kaq chansa.
He never noticed.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas repararqanchu.
The next step was devastating.	Qatiqnin ruwayqa sinchi llakikuypaqmi karqa.
He opened it up.	Paymi chayta kicharirqa.
He wanted to be there for her.	Payqa munarqanmi paypaq chaypi kayta.
I wish you wouldn’t.	Munayman mana chayta ruwanaykita.
Great ideas.	Hatun yuyayniyuq.
But this is not a bad thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan mana allinchu.
Instead, everything should be great.	Aswanpas tukuy imapas hatunmi kanan.
That's right, that's what you want to do.	Chayqa allinmi, chaytam ruwayta munanki.
I’m your guy.	Ñuqaqa qampa runam kani.
If only it were that simple.	Sichus chay hina facil kanman karqan chayqa.
He can’t say it right.	Mana allintachu niyta atin.
I am a much better person now.	Kunanqa aswan allin runam kani.
Again I disagree.	Yapamanta mana acuerdopichu kani.
I didn’t really think about that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani.
There’s no reason why he shouldn’t.	Manan imaraykupas mana ruwananchu.
I want to hear that too.	Ñoqapas chayta uyariyta munani.
This girl is going with us.	Kay sipasmi ñuqaykuwan rin.
I think they got this wrong.	Kayta pantasqa kasqankuta yuyani.
They know how to wait.	Paykunaqa yachanku suyayta.
He always lived there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi tiyaq.
There are things that can be done.	Chaypiqa kanmi imakuna ruwanapaq.
That was something wrong.	Chayqa imapas mana allinmi karqa.
Only you make it real.	Qamllam chiqap kananpaq ruwanki.
He said it was cold.	Payqa chiri kasqanmantam nirqa.
We did a lot of these things.	Chaykunataqa achkatam ruwaq kayku.
I didn’t really think about how or why that would happen.	Manam allintachu piensarqani imaynata nitaq imanasqa chayna kananta.
But, it all happened very quickly.	Ichaqa, tukuy imapas ancha utqayllam pasarqa.
In fact, maybe it’s not good enough.	Chiqamanta, ichapas mana allinchu kanman.
He didn’t say much at all.	Payqa manan anchatachu rimarqan ni imapipas.
Most people want to be rich and famous.	Yaqa llapan runakunam munanku qhapaq kayta hinaspa ancha riqsisqa kayta.
There were twenty of them in all.	Llapallankum iskay chunka karqa.
However, that may not be true.	Ichaqa, chayqa manapaschá cheqaqchu kanman.
I feel sick of it.	Chaywanmi unqusqa hina tarikuni.
Which was so nice about him.	Imataq ancha sumaq karqa paymanta.
But he doesn’t have to be alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kanan.
He certainly got it.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta chaskirqan.
So this is quick.	Chaymi kayqa utqaylla.
I wasn’t sure, maybe next time!.	Manam segurochu karqani, ichapas hamuq kutipi!.
He had been guilty for a long time.	Payqa unayñan huchayoq karqan.
He knows the way everywhere.	Payqa maypipas ñanta yachan.
Stop doing such a big deal.	Amaña chayna hatun ruwaytaqa ruwaychu.
So he was worried about it.	Chaymi payqa llakisqa kasharqan chaymanta.
He didn’t have to do much convincing.	Payqa manan anchatachu convencechiyta ruwanan karqan.
It wasn't right now.	Kunanqa manam allinchu karqa.
That’s what he did to me.	Chaytam ñuqawan ruwarqa.
Still, that doesn't matter.	Chayna kaptinpas chayqa manam imananpaschu.
I’m the smartest one.	Ñuqam aswan yachaysapa kani.
It’s so absurd that it could be anything.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi, chaymi imapas kanman.
Good if he did.	Allinmi sichus pay ruwarqan chayqa.
I know he will do this for me.	Yachanim kayta ñuqapaq ruwananta.
It wasn't supposed to be that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kanan karqa.
It is, .	Kayqa, .
But it probably wasn’t.	Ichaqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
Really what you want to do.	Chiqamanta ima ruwayta munasqaykita.
I can't understand why.	Manam entiendeyta atinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
You know you can't get out of here.	Yachankim kaymanta mana lluqsiyta atisqaykita.
This means you need to do three things.	Kayqa niyta munan kimsa ruwaykunata ruwanayki tiyan.
Yes but it was a good thing to do.	Arí ichaqa chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.
Unfortunately, however, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi kayqa mana sapa kutichu chayna.
He was in the hospital for about a week.	Payqa yaqa huk semanan hospitalpi kasharqan.
It sounds worse.	Aswan mana allinchu uyarikun.
He really is, though.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ichaqa.
They are not human beings.	Paykunaqa manam runachu kanku.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kayqa.
He is the moon.	Paymi killa.
Not doing it on time.	Mana tiempopi ruway.
I can do it today.	Kunan punchawmi ruwayta atiyman.
Almost like summer.	Yaqapaschá chiri killa hina.
So yeah, that was interesting.	Chaymi arí, chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Something very, very good.	Imapas ancha allin, ancha allin.
I mean the money.	Qullqita niyta munani.
He really wanted to know about you.	Payqa anchatam qammanta yachayta munarqa.
I haven’t done it yet.	Manaraqmi ruwarqanichu.
He always has something clever to say.	Payqa sapa kutim imapas yachaysapa rimananpaq kan.
Then again he acted like a child.	Chaymanta yapamanta payqa wawa hina ruwaq.
Once, maybe twice.	Huk kutilla, ichapas iskay kutilla.
This makes sense.	Kayqa yuyayniyuqmi.
So far, no one has done that.	Kunankamaqa manam pipas chaytaqa ruwanchu.
I never, ever, thought of it.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas, piensarqanichu.
And the big secret.	Hinaspa hatun pakasqa.
I didn’t do very well.	Mana ancha allintachu ruwarqani.
Don’t want things anymore.	Amaña imakunatapas munankichu.
She must be beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi kanan.
I was less successful.	Aswan pisi allinmi karqani.
It means both.	Iskayninkum niyta munan.
It was all he ever did now.	Chayllam kunan haykapipas ruwasqanqa karqa.
It takes two days.	Iskay punchawmi munan.
Three fools.	Kimsa mana yuyayniyuq runa.
That day I offered to help.	Chay punchawmi yanapanaypaq nirqani.
They’re not, it’s too hard.	Paykunaqa manan, sinchi sasachu.
There is nothing special about it.	Manam imapas ancha allinchu chaymantaqa.
I have been good to you.	Allintam qampaq karqani.
I don’t remember doing that.	Manam yuyarinichu chayta ruwasqayta.
Perhaps he has a reason for it.	Yaqapaschá payqa imaraykupas chayta ruwananpaq.
I have so much to tell you.	Anchatam willanaypaq kachkan.
I see nothing of this.	Kaymantaqa manam imatapas rikunichu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manan imapas mana allinchu.
He was there for me.	Payqa chaypim karqa ñuqapaq.
Is this a good thing.	Allinchu kayqa.
If he did, he wasn't here.	Sichus chayta ruwarqan chayqa, manan kaypichu karqan.
Maybe he really wanted out.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni lluqsiyta munarqa.
He should have been happy but he wasn’t.	Payqa kusisqa kanan karqan ichaqa manan.
This is one of the best.	Kayqa hukninmi aswan allin kaq.
I can’t remember now.	Manam kunanqa yuyariyta atinichu.
I really really want to see that baby you made.	Anchatam anchata munani chay wawa ruwasqaykita qawayta.
But yesterday was yesterday, today was today.	Ichaqa qayna punchawqa qayna punchawmi karqa, kunan punchawqa kunan punchawmi karqa.
This guy did it all.	Kay runaqa tukuyta ruwarqa.
This is probably the second best.	Kayqa yaqapaschá iskay kaq aswan allinqa.
A sad but true one.	Huk llakisqa ichaqa chiqap.
I still didn’t know.	Kunankamapas manam yacharqanichu.
He could have done it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwayta atinman karqan.
That won’t happen anytime soon.	Chayqa manan usqhayllachu kanqa.
Actually, maybe less.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas aswan pisi kanman.
He could not say otherwise.	Payqa manam niyta atirqachu mana chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really want to be this.	Anchatam munani kayta.
Maybe he just needs to do it.	Ichapas chaylla ruwanan kanman.
Half an hour, maybe.	Kuska hora, ichapas.
First, good for you.	Ñawpaqtaqa, allin qampaq.
Hopefully, that will be great.	Munaymanmi, chayqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
Everything about him was wrong.	Paymanta tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He really is.	Chiqaptam payqa.
They were very nice people, actually.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaq runakunam karqaku, chiqaptaqa.
But he doesn’t have her.	Ichaqa manan paytaqa kanchu.
This wouldn’t be the first time.	Kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman karqan.
I sort of agree.	Ñuqaqa huk laya acuerdopi kani.
You were scared and confused.	Mancharisqa, pantasqa ima karqanki.
Someone .	Pipas .
Needs more coffee.	Aswan kukata necesitan.
I don’t know what’s going to happen next.	Mana yachanichu imachus qatiqnin kanqa chayta.
So far everything is fine.	Kunankamaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kachkan.
For example, .	Kay hina, .
Say the child is hungry, scared, angry.	Wawa yarqasqa, mancharisqa, phiñasqa niy.
The man said yes.	Chay runaqa arí nisqa.
You do that, everybody’s happy.	Chaytaqa ruwanki, llapa runa kusisqa.
There it is, yes.	Chaypin kashan, arí.
But he will have to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanan kanqa.
I really should have done that.	Chiqaptam chayta ruwanay karqa.
They were such good people.	Chayna allin runakunam karqaku.
He was not such a strong man.	Payqa manam chayna sinchi runachu karqa.
Let's hope that happens today.	Suyasun kunan punchaw chayna kananpaq.
That happened to me, you know.	Chayqa ñuqawanqa pasarqa, yachanki.
Do whatever you want tonight.	Kunan tuta ima munasqaykita ruway.
You know exactly what it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki ima kasqanmanta.
He is at home now.	Payqa kunanmi wasinpi kachkan.
I'm sure that's a good thing.	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam seguro kani.
I always dislike it.	Sapa kutim mana allinpaq hapini.
All things said many times before.	Tukuy imakuna achka kuti ñawpaqta nisqa.
I'm going to talk to him today.	Kunanmi risaq paywan rimaq.
Maybe true, yes.	Ichapas chiqap, arí.
I’m so tired now.	Ancha sayk’usqañan kashani kunanqa.
All for no reason on my part.	Tukuy ima mana imaraykupas ñuqamanta.
That’s all it says.	Chayllam tukuyta nin.
He is going to ask a question.	Payqa tapuyta ruwananpaqmi kachkan.
Not as a villain, but as a human being.	Mana millay runa hinachu, aswanpas runa hina.
This couldn’t be worse.	Kayqa manan aswan mana allinchu kanman.
He was a year younger than me.	Payqa huk wata sullk’a karqan ñoqamanta.
I can be better.	Aswan allin kayta atiyman.
I'm tired too.	Ñoqapas sayk'usqañan kashani.
I thought a lot about that.	Chaypin anchata yuyaykurqani.
She could tell he was as worried as she was.	Payqa repararqanmi pay hina llakisqa kashasqanmanta.
I thought she was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
But I never wanted to do this.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
But he doesn’t know how to talk.	Ichaqa manan yachanchu imayna rimayta.
But now it seems less difficult.	Ichaqa kunanqa manaña ancha sasachu rikchakun.
I could barely hear him.	Yaqapaschá paytaqa uyarirqani.
He was first, as always.	Payqa ñawpaq kaqmi karqan, sapa kuti hina.
Be here on time.	Tiempollanpi kaypi kay.
He felt depressed.	Llakisqa tarikurqa.
This approach can be very useful.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I don’t want it for anyone.	Manam pimanpas munanichu.
When it’s bad, it’s always bad.	Mana allin kaptinqa sapa kutim mana allinchu.
I did all of this in a hurry.	Tukuy chaykunataqa usqhayllan ruwarqani.
I wanted to know who I was.	Pichus kasqaymanta yachayta munarqani.
I keep doing it.	Hinallam ruwani.
Be a better person than you are.	Qanmanta aswan allin runa kay.
You are mine, anyway.	Qamqa ñuqapa kanki, imayna kaptinpas.
He did look familiar.	Payqa chiqaptam riqsisqa rikchayniyuq karqa.
He made time.	Payqa tiempotan ruwarqan.
I could never leave.	Manam haykapipas ripuyta atiymanchu karqa.
Then again, maybe it is.	Chaymanta yapamanta, ichapas chayna kanman.
Here’s what he has to do.	Kaypiqa payqa ruwanan tiyan.
This is now the best day.	Kaymi kunanqa aswan allin punchaw.
I mean you can’t.	Mana atiwaqchu niyta munani.
No, about an hour later.	Manan, yaqa huk hora qhepamanmi.
Happier, really.	Aswan kusisqa, chiqap.
But he didn’t know what they were.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu imakuna kasqankuta.
It’s probably.	Yaqapaschá.
I always wanted that.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi munarqani.
This was the first one.	Kaymi karqan ñawpaq kaq.
He knows how to talk to you.	Payqa yachanmi qanwan rimayta.
But this is, of course, wrong.	Ichaqa kayqa, cheqaqtapunin, mana allinchu.
Not a married man.	Mana casarasqa runachu.
Now things are good, not good.	Kunanqa imapas allinmi, manam allinchu.
He was stupidly good.	Payqa sonso allinmi karqa.
This was last year.	Kayqa qayna wata karqa.
He wouldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chaytachu ruwanman karqan.
But I wasn’t surprised.	Ichaqa manan admirakurqanichu.
You are here, with me.	Qam kaypi kachkanki, ñuqawan.
Otherwise, good for him.	Mana chayqa, allin paypaq.
No, this is a good thing.	Manan, kayqa allinmi.
It is the most common method.	Chayqa aswan riqsisqa ruwaymi.
Several times something happened.	Achka kutim imapas pasarqa.
This doesn’t make much sense to me.	Kayqa mana ancha yuyayniyuqchu ñuqapaq.
I couldn’t do it either.	Ñuqapas mana atirqanichu.
Again, things are about right.	Yapamanta, imapas yaqa allinmi.
Forgive me if that’s the case.	Pampachaykuway chayna kaptinqa.
I can't fix it tonight.	Kunan tutaqa manam allichayta atiymanchu.
So a couple more on that.	Chaymi huk iskay aswan chaymanta.
Without it, it’s.	Mana chaywanqa.
But there is something more interesting.	Ichaqa kanmi aswan sumaq ruway.
The man looked at him.	Chay runaqa payta qhawarisqa.
I've heard that before.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaynatam uyarirqani.
I’m such a fool.	Chayna mana yuyayniyuqmi kani.
He should no longer act like a child.	Manañan wawa hinachu imatapas ruwanan.
I would never be able to work properly.	Manam haykapipas allinta llamkayta atiymanchu karqa.
Being here together tonight, that is.	Kunan tuta kaypi kuska kaspa, chaymi.
But it’s never easier.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas aswan facilchu.
He didn't know why they were here.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku kaypi kasqankuta.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Pampachaykuway, nispa.
You may think you are now.	Yaqapaschá kunan kasqaykita yuyaykunki.
All right, you’re right.	Allinmi, qampas.
Less of it, more.	Aswan pisi chaymanta, astawan.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan karqanchu.
Everyone can.	Lliwmi atin.
He was definitely angry.	Payqa segurom phiñasqa karqa.
But here, it was very clear.	Ichaqa kaypiqa, ancha sut’inmi karqan.
It seemed so silly.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuq hinam karqa.
This is rather impressive really.	Kayqa aswan admirakuypaqmi chiqaptapuni.
Tell me exactly what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta allinta willaway.
I don’t know how to think.	Manam yachanichu imayna yuyaymanayta.
He would be a teacher.	Payqa yachachiqmi kanman.
I didn’t see why not.	Manam rikurqanichu imarayku mana.
So tell me why you’re there.	Chaymi willaway imanasqa chaypi kasqaykita.
Maybe he really was.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni karqa.
This week not today.	Kay semanapi mana kunan punchawchu.
That said everything would be fine.	Chayqa nirqam tukuy imapas allin kanqa nispa.
I think it’s going to be a good time.	Allin tiempo kanqa nispan yuyaykuni.
Plenty of time this summer.	Achka pacha kay chiri killapi.
This will be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanqa.
This is not the case.	Kayqa manan hinachu.
No one is like you.	Manan pipas qan hinachu.
It looks uncertain.	Mana segurochu rikchakun.
I mean, so this is huge.	Niyta munani, chaymi kayqa hatunmi.
He held it there for a long time.	Chaypin unayta hap’irqan.
I thought that was really stupid.	Chayqa chiqap sonso kananpaqmi piensarqani.
He had no choice but to avoid it.	Payqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu mana chayta ruwananpaqqa.
One could be just as good.	Hukninmi ichaqa chayna allin kanman.
It was a new day.	Musuq punchawmi karqa.
To ensure that no one is there.	Mana pipas chaypi kananpaq.
It doesn’t say much.	Mana anchatachu nin.
But he wasn’t sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu karqan.
He knew exactly what he meant.	Payqa allintam yacharqa chayna nisqanmanta.
Who no one thought would win.	Pichus mana pipas yuyaykurqanchu atipananta.
What makes a story.	Imataq huk willakuyta ruwan.
It’s not too difficult.	Manan ancha sasachu.
He had such a positive attitude.	Payqa chayna allin yuyayniyuqmi karqa.
People .	Runakuna .
It is better to act immediately.	Aswan allinmi kanman chaylla imatapas ruway.
It’s worse though.	Aswan mana allinmi ichaqa.
That was several days.	Chayqa achka punchawmi karqa.
I don’t want to know any more.	Manañam astawan yachayta munanichu.
I know I have something for me.	Yachanim imapas ñuqapaq kasqanmanta.
Quick now,’ he says.	Utqaylla kunanqa’, nispas nin.
We do not agree that this is the case.	Manam acuerdopichu kayku chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Unfortunately, that person doesn’t exist.	Llakikuypaqmi chay runaqa mana kanchu.
But he still did the job well.	Ichaqa hinallam chay llamkayta allinta ruwarqa.
I am sure it is true.	Chiqap kasqanmantam seguro kani.
He looked at her seriously again.	Hukmanta payta serio qhawarisqa.
Maybe he’ll do that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwanman.
Like doing the right thing.	Allin kaqta ruway hina.
I like it better now.	Kunanqa aswan allintam gustan.
It’s always like this.	Sapa kutim kayna.
I know all too well about that anyway.	Chaymantaqa allintam yachani imayna kaptinpas.
He was pretty sure he was going to be fine.	Payqa yaqapaschá seguro kasharqan allin kananta.
He seemed angry and frightened.	Payqa phiñasqa mancharisqa hinan karqan.
This was the easiest thing to do.	Kayqa aswan facil ruwaymi karqa.
I know it's better.	Yachanim aswan allin kasqanmanta.
So do it there.	Chaymi chaypi ruway.
Probably never did.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas ruwarqanchu.
So you think about it.	Chaymi chaypi yuyaykunki.
Faster, faster .	Aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla .
Then, out came the reason.	Chaymanta, lluqsirqa imarayku.
Yes, it has always been so.	Arí, ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
But you’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kashanki.
He had no ulterior motive.	Payqa manan pakasqa imaraykupas karqanchu.
He certainly would.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
Half an hour maybe.	Kuska hora ichapas.
He used to be a teacher and a good teacher.	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa yachachiqmi karqan, allin yachachiqmi karqan.
I really wanted to buy something.	Ñuqaqa anchatam imatapas rantiyta munarqani.
I think he felt lonely.	Yuyaykuni sapallan sientekusqanmanta.
They all looked the same.	Llapallankum huk rikchayniyuq karqa.
All of this means a lot.	Tukuy kaykunaqa anchatam niyta munan.
You were with me the whole time.	Tukuy tiempon ñoqawan karqanki.
I lived there.	Chaypim yacharqani.
But it’s the man! 	¡Ichaqa chay runa!
No, it just seemed.	Manan, chayllaraqmi rikchakurqa.
He seemed fine so far.	Payqa kunankamaqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
It was still good though.	Kunankamapas allinmi karqan ichaqa.
Yes, that would be nice.	Arí, chayqa sumaqmi kanman.
Now it’s now.	Kunanqa kunanmi.
He wanted to do it so fast.	Chayna utqaylla ruwayta munarqa.
Maybe he was more worried about that than anything else.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan llakisqa karqa imamantapas.
Nothing there, really.	Mana imapas chaypiqa, chiqaptaqa.
But unfortunately there isn’t.	Ichaqa llakikuypaqmi mana kanchu.
I can't find information on this right now.	Kunanqa manam kaymanta willayta tarinichu.
So far you have failed.	Kunankamaqa mana allintachu ruwarqanki.
Now know the truth.	Kunanqa cheqaq kaqta yachay.
This doesn't have to be the only thing.	Kayqa manam chayllachu kanan.
But maybe he should have.	Ichaqa ichapas chayta ruwanan kanman karqa.
If you want to come with us.	Ñoqaykuwan hamuyta munaspaqa.
I don't like this thing, not at all.	Kay imapas manam gustanchu, manam imapipas.
I was really mad.	Chiqaptam loco karqani.
It’s not a new practice.	Manam musuq ruwaychu.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Chaytaqa manan ima ruwaytapas atirqanchu.
I thought they were.	Ñuqaqa yuyarqanim chayna kasqankuta.
If tonight was a lonely night, great.	Sichus kunan tuta sapallan tuta karqan chayqa, ancha allinmi.
Maybe there were real people here.	Ichapas kaypi chiqap runakuna karqa.
They were really bad.	Chiqamanta mana allinchu karqanku.
Sure would be good in the morning.	Seguro allin kanman tutamanta.
And how wonderful it would be if he did one.	Hinaspa imayna sumaq kanman hukta ruwaptinqa.
Obviously they weren’t good enough.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu karqanku.
And sure enough, they were.	Hinaspa seguro, paykunaqa karqan.
Isn’t that true.	Manachu chayna chiqap.
But it was a good time.	Ichaqa allin tiempon karqan.
You can’t be all that new.	Manan tukuy chay hina mosoq kayta atiwaqchu.
He should have been terrified of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kanan karqa.
So he knew it was now or never.	Chaymi yacharqa kunan utaq mana haykapipas kasqanmanta.
I saw this this afternoon.	Kayta rikurqani kunan tarde.
But this is, this .	Ichaqa kaymi, kay .
All of this is great.	Tukuy kaykunaqa hatunmi.
He was honest about his feelings.	Payqa allintan rimarqan imayna sientekusqanmanta.
This is like me.	Kayqa ñuqa hinam.
I’ve seen that over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutillanmi rikurqani.
I couldn’t stop expecting too much from him.	Manam saqiyta atirqanichu paymanta llumpayta suyayta.
Eat too fast.	Llumpay utqaylla mikhuy.
One can certainly go wrong with that.	Huk runaqa cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa mana allintachu ruwayta atinman.
I was like that all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chayna karqani.
This process needs to be addressed.	Kay ruwayqa allichayta necesitan.
He wasn’t good enough.	Payqa mana allinchu kasqa.
But he doesn’t know everything.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imatapas yachanchu.
He succeeded twice.	Iskay kutitam allinta ruwarqa.
I tried a lot, but I couldn't.	Achkatam kallpanchakurqani, ichaqa manam atirqanichu.
So he did the job.	Chaymi chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
I wanted to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munarqani.
I know everything about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta tukuy imamanta yachani.
I wish it was bigger.	Munaymanmi aswan hatun kananta.
How can he be happy.	¿Imaynataq kusisqa kanman.
But this is never fast enough.	Ichaqa kayqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu.
He couldn't fix it.	Payqa manam allichayta atirqachu.
You are not the only one.	Qamqa manam chayllachu kanki.
Obviously he couldn’t take it.	Sut’inmi mana chayta hap’iyta atirqanchu.
The truth is the present.	Chiqap kaqmi kunan kaq.
I want that to be taken care of.	Chayta qhawarisqa kananta munani.
They always are.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim chayna kanku.
There was no moon yet.	Manaraqmi killa karqachu.
It was very much like him.	Chayqa ancha pay hinam karqa.
I think one is too many.	Hukninmi ancha achka kasqanmantam piensani.
Not good enough to be sane.	Mana allinchu allin yuyayniyuq kananpaq.
Yeah, that’s just a big one.	Arí, chaylla huk hatun.
He was more than happy to do so.	Payqa aswan kusisqan kasharqan chayta ruwaspa.
Even if it’s really cold.	Chiqap chiri kaptinpas.
He knew it was important.	Payqa yacharqanmi ancha importante kasqanmanta.
Where he lives.	Maypichus payqa tiyan.
I thought he was good at it.	Chay ruwaypi allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
They don’t, either.	Paykunaqa manan, nitaq.
This makes complete sense.	Kayqa llapanpim allin yuyayniyuq.
I mean we did that.	Chayta ruwarqayku niyta munani.
But that has always been the case.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna karqan.
He could not speak now.	Payqa manam kunanqa rimayta atirqachu.
But one fine day he was gone.	Ichaqa huk sumaq punchawmi manaña karqachu.
You’re good for nothing.	Mana imapaqpas allinmi kanki.
Whatever the reason.	Imarayku kaptinpas.
Surprisingly, he began to respond.	Admirakuypaqmi kutichiyta qallaykurqa.
Someone will come for you.	Pipas qampaq hamunqa.
Who’s the youngest.	Pitaq sullk’a.
You need to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanayki.
Know that it is never too late.	Yachay mana haykapipas tarde kasqanmanta.
This was a difficult thing for me to do.	Kayna ruwayqa sasa karqa ñuqapaq.
I mean, that's obvious.	Niyta munani, chayqa sut'inmi.
Now go, and fast.	Kunanqa riy, hinaspa utqaylla.
The same person.	Chay kikin runa.
Black but better.	Yana ichaqa aswan allin.
He wanted to be someone.	Payqa pipas kaytam munarqa.
That’s what they know now.	Chaytan kunan yachanku.
I make it funny.	Asikunapaq hinam ruwani.
So many never.	Chaymi achka mana haykapipas.
And three months.	Hinaspa kimsa killa.
I certainly know who you are.	Cheqaqtapunin yachani pi kasqaykita.
He looked very busy.	Payqa ancha ocupasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
This he does not intend to do.	Kaytaqa manan ruwayta yuyaykunchu.
But this is crazy.	Ichaqa kayqa loco kaymi.
The result was amazing, amazing.	Chay ruwasqanqa admirakuypaqmi karqa, admirakuypaqmi karqa.
I hope to be recognized.	Suyachkani riqsisqa kayta.
Instead, he was fine about it.	Aswanpas chaymantaqa allinmi karqan.
An hour passed and then another.	Huk hora pasarqa chaymanta huk hora.
So, okay, that's obvious.	Chaymi, allinmi, chayqa sut'inmi.
And then everything was fine.	Hinaspa chaymantaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
So that's pretty much me today.	Chaymi chayqa yaqa ñuqamanta kunan punchaw.
Otherwise, tomorrow is a new day.	Mana chayqa, paqarinmi musuq punchaw.
He can’t say it.	Mana niyta atinchu.
So it seems like a big deal.	Chaymi hatun ruwayman rikchakun.
I am not a stranger.	Manam mana riqsisqa runachu kani.
I can't work out why.	Manam llamkayta atinichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Go home if you want.	Munaspaqa wasiykiman riy.
There he is like everyone else.	Chaypin payqa llapa runakuna hina kashan.
I have to do what he says.	Chay nisqanman hinam ruwanay.
Now it was everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas kasqa.
It’s great to have you this morning.	Ancha allinmi kunan paqarin qanwan kayqa.
Yeah, that’s a big deal.	Arí, chayqa hatunmi.
Now, the next thing.	Kunanqa, qatiqnin kaq.
But he could find nothing.	Ichaqa manan imatapas tariyta atirqanchu.
Never, never again, never again.	Mana hayk’aqpas, manaña hayk’aqpas, manaña hayk’aqpas.
It just seems appealing.	Chaylla munaymanmi rikchakun.
He was always there for her.	Payqa sapa kutim paywan karqa.
Later, he spoke again.	Qhepamanmi hukmanta rimarqan.
It is set up well.	Allinmi churasqa kachkan.
He was going to be fired.	Payqa qarqosqa kanan karqan.
And to be out there.	Hinaspa chaypi hawapi kananpaq.
I’m just terrified.	Chaylla mancharisqa kachkani.
After all, you are there.	Tukuy imamanta, qamqa chaypi kachkanki.
And now, here it is.	Hinaspa kunan, kaypi kachkan.
He did this well.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwarqa.
I'm sure something better will come.	Seguro kani imapas aswan allin hamunanta.
That was the time.	Chayqa karqan pacha.
He wouldn’t do anything.	Manam imapipas ruwanmanchu.
It should be a good year.	Allin wata kanan.
This was to be the last.	Kayqa qhipa kaq kanan karqa.
He knows something is wrong.	Payqa yachanmi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
It was there all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chaypi kasqa.
A few good people.	Iskay kimsa allin runakuna.
Like, seriously fast.	Imayna, serio usqhaylla.
Probably the stupidity.	Yaqapaschá chay sonso kay.
I’m really, really looking forward to that.	Chiqamanta, chiqamanta chayta suyachkani.
He was very curious.	Payqa sinchitan yachayta munarqan.
That was actually amazing.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa admirakuypaqmi karqa.
He still doesn't know where he is.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu maypi kasqanmanta.
Who will come soon.	Pitaq chaylla hamunqa.
That's just kind of funny.	Chayqa huk laya asikunapaq hinallam.
They are not bad at all.	Paykunaqa manan imapipas mana allinchu kanku.
However, there is something.	Ichaqa, imapas kanmi.
But you are here now.	Ichaqa kunanmi kaypi kachkanki.
Good night now.	Allin tuta kunan.
It seemed ridiculous.	Asikunapaq hinam rikchakurqa.
I really wanted to talk to him.	Anchatam munarqani paywan rimayta.
That is, where appropriate.	Chayqa, maypichus allin kanman chaypi.
There are a lot of people there.	Chaypin askha runakuna kashan.
It’s much nicer out here.	Aswan sumaqmi kay hawapi.
It would have been about ten.	Chunka hinam kanman karqa.
Really and truly scared.	Chiqap hinaspa chiqap mancharisqa.
I know it's a lot for him.	Yachanim paypaq achka kasqanmanta.
You said this is very important.	Kayqa ancha importante kasqanmantam nirqanki.
I don't remember when it was.	Manam yuyarinichu haykapi kasqanmantaqa.
And say more.	Hinaspa astawan niy.
The best house.	Aswan allin wasi.
I probably wouldn’t have done that.	Manachá chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqan.
I think things can be good.	Yuyaykuni imapas allin kanman.
He wanted to conquer everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam atipayta munarqa.
And now he knew they were hidden.	Hinaspa kunanqa yacharqanmi pakasqa kasqankuta.
This is a silly thing to do.	Kayqa mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi.
The second time the man spoke.	Iskay kaq kutita runa rimaq.
Otherwise, you have no choice.	Mana chayqa, manan ima ruwaytapas atiwaqchu.
Now it was here.	Kunanqa kaypim karqa.
And he told me, no.	Hinaspa niwarqan, manan.
I’m not a real baby person.	Ñuqaqa manam chiqap wawa runachu kani.
He knew there was nothing he could do.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu, chaytan yacharqan.
I think it will do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwananta.
Not today or tomorrow.	Mana kunan p'unchawchu nitaq paqarin p'unchawchu.
It was home again.	Yapamanta wasi kasqa.
This makes everything harder.	Kaymi tukuy imata aswan sinchita ruwan.
Both are wicked.	Iskayninkum mana allin ruwaq kanku.
But he was a terrible, terrible player.	Ichaqa manchay, manchay pukllaqmi karqan.
They want that very badly.	Chaytaqa ancha mana allintam munanku.
This is not like mine.	Kayqa manam ñuqapa hinachu.
And what’s wrong with him.	Hinaspa imataq paywan mana allin kasqanmanta.
A really great kid.	Chiqap hatun wawa.
I went to say something, but thought better of it.	Imatapas rimaq rirqani, ichaqa aswan allinta yuyaykurqani.
I thought less was better.	Yuyarqanim aswan pisi nisqa aswan allin kasqanmanta.
They do exist, unfortunately.	Paykunaqa kanmi, llakikuypaqmi.
He speaks very often.	Payqa ancha sapa kutim riman.
Would it be that bad? 	¿Chayna mana allinchu kanman?
Many wouldn’t last long.	Achka mana unaytachu kanman.
If you want to do something else.	Sichus hukta ruwayta munanki chayqa.
He wasn’t in a hurry.	Payqa manan usqhayllachu puriq.
Say once a week.	Semanapi huk kutita niy.
I wish it was mine.	Munaymanmi ñuqapa kananpaq.
Ten years younger.	Chunka wata sullk’a.
Describe how great it is.	Willay imayna hatun kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to say anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
I didn’t think I had to do it all the time.	Manam piensarqanichu sapa kuti ruwanay kasqanmanta.
But now this.	Ichaqa kunan kay.
I want to know how to deal with that.	Chayta imayna atipayta yachayta munani.
That’s what’s here.	Chayqa kaypi kachkan.
So that was something.	Chaymi chayqa imapas karqa.
But I’m not sure he didn’t.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I can’t do it now.	Manam kunanqa atiymanchu.
I wanted to go every day.	Sapa punchawmi riyta munarqani.
That’s almost never a good thing.	Chayqa yaqa mana hayk’aqpas allinchu.
This looks like it would be great for me.	Kayqa ñuqapaq ancha allin kanman hinam rikchakun.
They weren’t together.	Paykunaqa manan kuskachu karqanku.
But it’s not always that simple.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina facilchu.
He is the worst person.	Payqa aswan mana allin runam.
He’ll be fine for a while.	Payqa huk rato allinmi kanqa.
Maybe everybody knows about it.	Ichapas sapa runa yachan chaymanta.
I’m afraid of that.	Chaytaqa manchakuni.
The more realistic, the better.	Aswan chiqap kaptinqa aswan allinmi.
Obviously, it will certainly be safe.	Sut’inmi, cheqaqtapunin seguro kanqa.
I sort of knew that.	Chaytaqa huk laya yacharqanim.
Now there’s really no other option.	Kunanqa manan cheqaqtachu huk ruwayqa kanman.
That was a terrible thing.	Chayqa sinchi mana allinmi karqan.
It would mean something.	Imapas niyta munanman karqa.
And go he did.	Hinaspa riy payqa ruwarqa.
I really don't know everything.	Chiqaptaqa manam tukuy imatapas yachanichu.
That means he’s there.	Chayqa niyta munan payqa chaypi kachkan.
There is wealth in it.	Chaypin kashan qhapaq kay.
I wasn’t there anymore.	Manañam ñuqaqa karqachu.
She means everything to me.	Payqa tukuy imatam ñuqapaq niyta munan.
You’re so foolish.	Ancha mana yuyayniyuqmi kanki.
There is so much background.	Ancha achka ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.
Repeat this several times each day.	Chaynataqa sapa punchaw achka kutita niy.
But I didn’t want to talk.	Ichaqa manan rimayta munarqanichu.
It’s funny though.	Asikunapaq hina ichaqa.
They are intelligent people.	Paykunaqa yachaysapa runakunam.
I hope one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw.
I’m actually not human.	Chiqaptaqa manam runachu kani.
That doesn’t mean everything is going to be okay.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu tukuy imapas allinpaq kasqanta.
Please tell me what happened.	Ama hina kaspa, imachus pasasqanmanta willaway.
Do the best you can do.	Aswan allin ruway atisqaykita ruway.
He was cold, cold, cold.	Payqa chiri, chiri, chiri kasqa.
It was not an easy building.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan wasi ruwayqa.
I would be like that person.	Chay runa hinam kayman.
That’s what I do now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwani.
He wasn't quite sure where he was.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan maypi kasqanmanta.
I couldn't bear to look at mine.	Manam aguantayta atirqanichu ñuqapa kaqta qawayta.
You knew that a long time ago.	Unayñan chaytaqa yacharqanki.
It doesn’t mean anything anymore.	Manañam imatapas niyta munanchu.
We are very proud of that.	Chaywanmi anchata orgulloso kayku.
He said he couldn’t.	Mana atisqanmanta nisqa.
Construction was quick.	Ruwayqa usqhayllan karqan.
They are not here.	Paykunaqa manan kaypiqa kanchu.
This was obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi karqan.
The whole process was really interesting.	Tukuy chay ruwayqa chiqamanta sumaq karqa.
Here’s how and why you should.	Kaypi imaynata, imarayku ruwanayki tiyan.
Perhaps he knew this once, and knew it again.	Ichapas huk kutipi kayta yacharqa, hinaspa yapamanta yacharqa.
I know he doesn't look very pretty tonight.	Yachanim kunan tuta mana ancha sumaq rikchayniyuq kasqanmanta.
But don’t be so sure.	Ichaqa ama chhayna seguro kaychu.
So you have to do it right every time.	Chaymi sapa kutilla allinta ruwanayki.
There to do it.	Chaypi ruwanapaq.
Then it went faster.	Chaymantaqa aswan utqayllam rirqa.
I want to play this weekend.	Kay semana tukukuypi pukllayta munani.
It was surprising but not surprising.	Chayqa admirakuypaqmi karqa ichaqa mana admirakuypaqmi karqa.
They always want money.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim qullqita munanku.
I won’t be the only one.	Mana ñuqallachu kanqa.
There’s no seriousness there.	Manam chaypiqa kanchu serio kay.
I know what is in trouble.	Yachanim imakuna sasachakuypi kasqanmanta.
He knew how to deal with it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta imayna atipananta.
They were expelled.	Paykunaqa qarqusqa karqanku.
He's faster though.	Payqa aswan utqaylla ichaqa.
He doesn’t really say I’m innocent.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu nin mana huchayoq kasqayta.
The real thing, maybe.	Chiqap kaq, ichapas.
He is with you now.	Payqa kunanmi qanwan kachkan.
But I wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqani.
No one wants to be uncertain.	Manan pipas mana seguro kayta munanchu.
They were very uncomfortable.	Paykunaqa ancha mana allinchu karqaku.
That happened a few years ago.	Chayqa pasarqa iskay kimsa wata ñawpaqtaraqmi.
This sounds awfully familiar.	Kayqa manchay riqsisqa hinam uyarikun.
And you said yes.	Hinaspa arí nirqanki.
Needless to say that was never a good thing.	Manañam niyta munanichu chayqa manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
We are very excited about it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkaniku chaymanta.
There is a problem with that though.	Chaywanmi ichaqa sasachakuy kachkan.
I think of things.	Imakunatapas yuyaykuni.
I still feel uncomfortable.	Hinallam mana allintachu sientekuni.
He didn’t want to stay long.	Payqa manan unayta qhepakuyta munarqanchu.
Something could have gone wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman karqa.
One day he said something very interesting.	Huk punchawmi ancha sumaq kaqta nirqa.
I thought we did better than that.	Chaymanta aswan allinta ruwasqaykumanta yuyaykurqani.
The world is like a human being.	Kay pachapi runakunaqa huk runa hinam kanku.
Therein lies his future.	Chaypin hamuq tiempon kashan.
That will always be the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim kanqa.
But, again, it wasn’t bad.	Ichaqa, yapamanta, manan mana allinchu karqan.
He really wanted to do it.	Payqa anchatam ruwayta munarqa.
And it went wrong very quickly.	Hinaspa ancha utqaylla mana allintachu rirqa.
Good, very good, but not good.	Allin, ancha allin, ichaqa mana allinchu.
I mean, he’s a good guy.	Niyta munani, payqa allin runam.
I don’t know what yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu imata.
I never thought about it again.	Manañam haykapipas chaypiqa piensarqanichu.
One of them was there.	Hukninmi chaypi karqa.
Two afternoons.	Iskay tarde.
I am very proud of what we have accomplished.	Anchatam orgulloso kani imakuna ruwasqaykumanta.
I thought this was strange.	Kayqa mana riqsisqa kananpaqmi yuyaykurqani.
You said it right.	Cheqaqtapunin nirqanki.
That’s really complicated.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sasachakuypi tarikun.
I can’t go out in the morning.	Manam tutamanta lluqsiyta atinichu.
I don’t want to see you hurt.	Manam munanichu k’irisqa kasqaykita qawayta.
I was worried all day.	Tukuy punchawmi llakisqa karqani.
Not there, you know.	Mana chaypichu, yachanki.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
Often badly late.	Achka kutipi mana allinta tarde.
So far, he doesn’t think he will.	Kunankamaqa manan yuyaykunchu chayta ruwananta.
I am very nervous about this.	Kaymantaqa anchatam manchakuni.
Thirty more wounded.	Kimsa chunka aswan k’irisqa.
He doesn't want to talk about it today.	Payqa manan kunan tiempopi chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
But certainly, in the future.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin, hamuq tiempopi.
If going fast is good, he goes fast.	Utqaylla riy allin kaptinqa utqayllam rin.
About being good.	Allin kaymanta.
It all kind of went from there.	Tukuy laya chaymanta rirqa.
This is a very bad thing to do.	Kayqa ancha mana allin ruwaymi.
I really hope you might want to.	Chiqamanta suyachkani ichapas chayta munanki.
And it was a big deal here.	Hinaspa kaypi hatun ruwaymi karqan.
I’m not the smartest person out there.	Manam chay hawapi aswan yachaysapa runachu kani.
More difficulty.	Aswan sasachakuy.
This process will need to be repeated several times.	Kay ruwaytaqa achka kutita ruwana kanqa.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manam allinchu.
Otherwise you’ll be fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi kanki.
What is real and what is not.	Imataq chiqap kaqta, imataq mana chiqap kaqta.
He’s a real player it would be.	Payqa chiqap pukllaqmi chayna kanman.
Yes, this kind of thing was good.	Arí, kay hinaqa allinmi karqan.
Now he does it all the time.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempon chayta ruwan.
But it's better here than anywhere else.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kaypi mana maypipas kasqanmantaqa.
Someone better than me.	Pipas ñuqamanta aswan allinqa.
I don’t think I’m going anywhere right now.	Kunanqa manan maymanpas rinaypaq yuyaykunichu.
He was hardly alone.	Payqa yaqapaschá sapallan kasharqan.
He died at the scene a short time later.	Payqa pisi tiempollamantan chaypi wañupurqan.
Eat more frequently.	Aswan sapa kuti mikhuy.
But such rich people.	Ichaqa chay hina qhapaq runakunaqa.
He had always been such a nice guy.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna sumaq wayna karqan.
Obviously it wasn’t right.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu kasharqan.
Everything and nothing.	Tukuy imapas hinaspa mana imapas.
So it wouldn’t be all that bad.	Chaymi mana tukuy chay mana allinchu kanman.
Instead, do something about it.	Aswanpas chaymantaqa imatapas ruway.
And that’s what it means.	Hinaspa chaymi niyta munan.
Today would have been a great day.	Kunan punchawqa hatun punchawmi kanman karqa.
He always wanted to take a job.	Payqa sapa kutim llamkayta hapiyta munarqa.
It should be beautiful.	Sumaq kanan.
Yes, every single day.	Arí, sapa sapa punchaw.
Now, he probably wanted her to.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta munarqan.
But these are.	Ichaqa kaykunaqa.
But this was a long time ago.	Ichaqa kayqa unayñan kasharqan.
He was angry about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta phiñasqa kasqa.
He knew he didn't like that.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta mana gustasqanmanta.
You do it all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chayta ruwanki.
He really wanted to make a great movie.	Payqa anchatan munarqan huk sumaq peliculata ruwayta.
That sounds pretty simple, so it should be fine.	Chayqa ancha facilmi uyarikun, chaymi allin kanan.
He was unfortunately frightened.	Payqa llakikuypaqmi mancharisqa karqa.
He knew there was a chance of this.	Payqa yacharqanmi kaymanta chansa kasqanmanta.
I always think so.	Sapa kutim chaynata piensani.
Monday was such a day.	Lunes punchawmi chayna punchaw karqa.
He’s a smart guy.	Payqa yachaysapa wayna.
I hope it's not too late now.	Suyachkani kunan mana ancha tarde kananpaq.
Black is the name.	Yana sutin.
If it looked good, that was a good thing.	Allinmi rikchakurqa chayqa allinmi karqa.
Was this the case.	¿Kaychu karqan.
It was, and he knew it.	Chayqa karqan, chaytan payqa yacharqan.
It’s OK to disagree with someone.	Piwanpas mana acuerdopi kayqa allinmi.
No one could understand it.	Chaytaqa manam pipas entiendeyta atirqachu.
No one is good anywhere.	Manam pipas maypipas allinchu.
He didn't know why he expected one.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku hukta suyasqanmanta.
I want it right but it's not ready.	Allintam munani ichaqa manam listochu kachkan.
I’m not going to do it tonight.	Manam kunan tutaqa ruwasaqchu.
I couldn’t answer that.	Chaytaqa manan kutichiyta atirqanichu.
I do this too, too.	Ñuqapas kaytam ruwani.
He did the driving.	Paymi chay manejayta ruwarqa.
I don’t know why he was mean to her.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa paywan millay kasqanmanta.
He’s unhappy, so you’re unhappy he’s unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu, chaymi mana kusisqachu kanki payqa mana kusisqachu.
This process continued.	Kay ruwayqa hinallam karqa.
Get things done.	Imakunatapas ruway.
Why is it there? 	¿Imanasqataq chaypi?
That speech will be good.	Chay rimayqa allinmi kanqa.
There', that's right.	Chaypi', chaymi.
I can still hear it well.	Kunankamapas allintam uyarini.
I did the whole song really fast.	Tukuy takiyta chiqap utqaylla ruwarqani.
We didn’t do very well about it.	Manam ancha allintachu chaymantaqa ruwarqayku.
A really nice baby.	Chiqap sumaq wawa.
Where he is.	Maypichus payqa.
Now you are one of them.	Kunanqa hukninmi kanki.
But I’m not quite sure how.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatachus chayta.
Something is good thanks.	Imapas allinmi gracias.
If you want to talk to him, you better do it soon.	Paywan rimayta munanki chayqa, aswan allinmi kanman usqhaylla ruway.
Hopefully that will make him a better person.	Munaymanmi chay ruwasqanqa aswan allin runa kananpaq.
And so, it was a very difficult time, really.	Hinaspa chayna, ancha sasa tiempo karqa, chiqaptapuni.
Of course, this was not always the case.	Arí, manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
It was very fast, very fast.	Ancha utqayllam karqa, ancha utqayllam karqa.
Perhaps he would like to.	Yaqapaschá payqa munanman.
But he didn’t think about it.	Ichaqa manan chaypichu yuyaykurqan.
And now tell me where it is.	Hinaspa kunan willaway maypi kasqanmanta.
He looked scared and crazy.	Payqa mancharisqa, loco hina qhawarisqa.
No reason why not.	Mana imaraykupas mana.
I am a stranger there.	Chaypiqa mana riqsisqa runam kani.
But something did it to him.	Ichaqa imapas chaytan paytaqa ruwarqan.
I want to be important.	Importante kaytam munani.
Something that is important to you.	Imapas qampaq ancha allin kaq.
So he really wanted to think about it a lot.	Chaymi payqa anchata munarqan chaypi anchata yuyaymanayta.
But this was unfortunate.	Ichaqa kayqa llakikuypaqmi karqa.
If you don’t know anything, please learn about this.	Sichus mana imatapas yachankichu chayqa, ama hina kaspa kaymanta yachay.
He died a long time ago.	Payqa unayñan wañupurqan.
That obviously wasn’t the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana karqanchu.
I really felt very foolish.	Chiqaptam ancha mana yuyayniyuq hina tarikurqani.
We’re pretty good at that.	Chaypaqqa allin allinmi kayku.
She was a very tough girl.	Payqa sinchi sinchi sipasmi karqan.
But things are never that simple.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu imapas.
This isn’t so much now.	Kayqa manan anchatachu kunanqa.
But, as above, maybe not.	Ichaqa, hawapi hina, ichapas mana.
That was the first step.	Chayqa karqan ñawpaq kaq ruwaymi.
That is perhaps the most difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa yaqapaschá aswan sasa ruwayqa.
So true, so true, so true.	Chayna chiqap, ancha chiqap, ancha chiqap.
Make it safer.	Aswan seguro kananpaq ruway.
Sick of loneliness.	Sapallan kaymanta unqusqa.
Everything feels cold.	Tukuy imapas chiri hinam tarikun.
That person is you, the real you.	Chay runaqa qanmi kanki, cheqaq qanmi.
I don’t like it, but it’s good.	Manam gustanchu, ichaqa allinmi.
But it was a good first step.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan ñawpaq kaq ruway.
Someone had to do it for him.	Pipas paypaq ruwanan karqan.
So it happened many times.	Chaymi achka kutipi chayna pasarqa.
No, this makes no sense.	Manan, kayqa manan imapaqpas valenchu.
A few months ago everything seemed fine.	Iskay kimsa killa ñawpaqtaqa tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
To do so is to commit a crime.	Chayta ruwayqa mana allin ruwaykunata ruwaymi.
True wealth cannot.	Chiqap qhapaq kayqa manam atinmanchu.
I don’t have time anymore.	Manañam tiempoy kanchu.
It’s very childlike.	Ancha wawa hinam.
Strong and happy.	Sinchi hinaspa kusisqa.
But if it doesn't, that's fine.	Ichaqa mana chayna kaptinqa allinmi.
She was very sad and depressed.	Payqa ancha llakisqa, sinchi llakisqa ima kasqa.
Always act innocent.	Sapa kuti mana huchayoq hina ruway.
Maybe it’s .	Ichapas chayqa .
Maybe that was that.	Ichapas chay chay karqa.
So he doesn’t do anything.	Chaymi mana imatapas ruwanchu.
The patient is scared.	Unqusqa mancharisqa.
I can't hold it.	Manam hapiyta atinichu.
If so, it means something is wrong.	Chayna kaptinqa imapas mana allin kasqanmantam niyta munan.
But now, of course, he is.	Ichaqa kunanqa, sut’inmi, payqa kashan.
They are very intelligent.	Paykunaqa ancha yuyayniyuqmi kanku.
I’m the one.	Ñuqa kanan.
He’s too nice not to.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi mana ruwananpaq.
Anything that’s good for me.	Imapas ñuqapaq allin kaq.
In fact, it was the only thing he was ever going to do.	Chiqaptaqa, chayllam haykapipas ruwanan karqa.
He was always overly intelligent.	Payqa sapa kutim llumpay yuyayniyuq karqa.
It’s not the only thing.	Manan chayllachu.
Not much there really.	Mana anchatachu chaypi chiqaptaqa.
He never rushed her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas usqhayllachu paytaqa ruwarqan.
However, this doesn’t seem quite right.	Ichaqa, kayqa manan allintachu rikch’akun.
And then a funny thing happened.	Hinaspa chaymanta huk asikunapaq kaq pasarqa.
That’s one of them at least.	Chayqa hukninmi aswanpas.
Be something about him.	Paymanta imapas kay.
He always knew.	Payqa sapa kutim yacharqa.
That certainly did it.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
He did it accordingly.	Chayman hinam chayta ruwarqa.
They were really quick.	Paykunaqa chiqaptam utqaylla karqaku.
I don’t know how you would do that.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta ruwawaq chayta.
Something really wrong.	Imapas chiqap mana allintachu.
Really and truly.	Chiqaptapuni hinaspa chiqaptapuni.
I will never be good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kasaq.
The process is unique.	Chay ruwayqa sapallanmi.
He thought today would be better.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kunan p’unchay aswan allin kananta.
He looked hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa hinan qhawarisqa.
I have no idea what will happen.	Manam ima yuyayniyuqchu kani imakuna pasananta.
Now everything would have to be hurried.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam utqaylla ruwana kanman karqa.
I’m not quite sure when.	Manam allintachu yachani haykapi.
That will eventually make things worse.	Chayqa qhepamanmi imapas mana allintachu ruwanqa.
A girl was with me.	Huk sipasmi ñoqawan kasqa.
So, very, tired.	Chaymi, ancha, sayk’usqa.
I had no reason to see it.	Manam imaraykupas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
I know they are here.	Yachanim kaypi kasqankuta.
They are all pretty much wrong.	Llapallankum yaqa pantasqa kachkan.
That’s okay, though.	Chayqa allinmi, ichaqa.
So I thought about it.	Chaymi yuyaykurqani.
Instead, it goes back in time.	Aswanpas ñawpaqmantaraqmi rin.
You can’t be that person either.	Qampas manam chay runa kayta atiwaqchu.
That’s why we need to do things together.	Chayraykum kuska imatapas ruwananchik.
He knows how that happened.	Payqa yachanmi imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
And you were there the whole time.	Hinaspa chay tukuy tiempo chaypi karqanki.
But there is no time for that.	Ichaqa manan chaypaqqa tiempo kanchu.
It’s not what anyone calls a real teacher.	Manam pipas chiqap yachachiq nisqanman hinachu.
I’m sure there’s more.	Seguro kani aswan kasqanmanta.
And he said something.	Hinaspa imatapas nisqa.
I'm going tonight.	Kunan tutam risaq.
He wants to get her.	Payqa payta hap’iyta munan.
Everything in the past now, anyway.	Tukuy imapas ñawpaqpi kunan, imayna kaptinpas.
We’re clear, you have your opinion.	Sut’inmi kayku, kanmi yuyaykusqaykita.
Something that’s not so bad right now.	Imapas kunanpacha mana ancha millay kananpaq.
He’s worried about me.	Payqa ñuqamanta llakisqa kachkan.
But beyond this.	Ichaqa kaymanta aswan qhepaman.
And we’re so glad it happened.	Hinaspa ancha kusisqa kayku chay pasasqanmanta.
She was happy to finally be on her own.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan qhepaman sapallan kasqanmanta.
It’s actually sad.	Chiqaptaqa llakikuypaqmi.
Things are right there.	Chaypiqa imapas allinmi kachkan.
You want to be quick.	Utqaylla kayta munanki.
Who, and why.	Pitaq, imaraykutaq.
I'm just so tired of it.	Chayllam chaymantaqa ancha sayk'usqa kachkani.
Who was here, or there.	Pitaq kaypi karqa, icha chaypi.
That sounds like a good thing.	Chayqa allin kananpaqmi uyarikun.
I don’t need food now.	Kunanqa manan mikhunata necesitasaqchu.
These things happened over two days.	Chaykunataqa iskay punchawmi pasarqa.
Two children first.	Iskay wawa ñawpaqta.
Do you disagree?.	¿Manachu acuerdopi kanki?.
That is today.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi.
But one after the other.	Ichaqa hukmanta hukmanta.
Sure, they want things to be better.	Seguro, paykunaqa munanku imapas aswan allin kananta.
Maybe he didn't get it right.	Ichapas mana allintachu hapisqa.
I have to do this all the time.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanay.
Of course, that would be a morning routine.	Arí, chayqa paqarin paqarin ruwaymi kanman.
Really, really, really really.	Chiqap, chiqap, chiqap chiqap.
Don't do anything here.	Ama kaypi imatapas ruwaychu.
He didn’t know what anyone wanted.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu pipas ima munasqanta.
I know it is, actually.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta, chiqaptaqa.
If you want to go.	Riyta munaspaqa.
I hope to be there one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw chaypi kayta.
If there was one thing to do, it was good.	Sichus huk ruway karqan chayqa, allinmi karqan.
I can't stop that.	Chaytaqa manam harkayta atiymanchu.
And today was a big one.	Hinaspa kunan punchawqa hatunmi karqa.
The third cup of coffee.	Kimsa kaq kukata.
He always wanted to know the way home.	Payqa sapa kutillanmi wasinman ñanta yachayta munarqan.
He wants to be nice to you.	Payqa munanmi qanpaq sumaq kayta.
That was a success.	Chayqa huk allin ruwaymi karqan.
He’s never been the best.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas aswan allinqa karqanchu.
But we weren’t happy walking around, barely talking.	Ichaqa mana kusisqachu puriq kayku, yaqapaschá rimaq kayku.
This was the most foolish thing to do.	Kayqa aswan mana yuyayniyuq ruwaymi karqan.
The brief period in which .	Chay pisi pacha maypichus .
No, but .	Manan, ichaqa .
He knows it’s up to you.	Yachan qammanta kan.
He has no use for it yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chaymantaqa imapaqpas valenchu.
There is something stupid and wrong about that.	Chaypiqa kanmi imapas sonso hinaspa mana allin.
No, not the person there.	Manan, manan chaypi kaq runachu.
He looked serious.	Payqa serio hinam rikchakurqa.
But how can I do this.	Ichaqa imaynatataq kayta ruwayman.
Obviously this was a problem.	Sut’inmi kayqa sasachakuy karqan.
He thought that was it.	Payqa chaytan yuyaykurqan.
I need to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwanay tiyan.
I'd rather not be there.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaypi kayqa.
Usually three or more.	Yaqa llapanpim kimsa utaq aswan achka.
Probably two or three.	Yaqapaschá iskay kimsa.
It's tough right now, but we're there.	Kunanqa sinchi sasam, ichaqa chaypim kachkaniku.
I wasn’t such a bad guy.	Manam chayna millay runachu karqani.
This could be the worst thing ever.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi kanman imapipas.
A terrible one, actually.	Huk manchay, chiqaptaqa.
Never heard of it before.	Mana hayk’aqpas chaymanta uyarirqanichu.
Yes, he wants to talk to you.	Arí, payqa qanwan rimayta munan.
He truly means every word.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sapa simita niyta munan.
I’m not going to do it any other way.	Manam huk hinachu ruwasaq.
Everything was fine again.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa yapamanta.
He knew he was a good man.	Payqa yacharqanmi allin runa kasqanmanta.
If you don’t, there is.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, kanmi.
Less, if you’re foolish.	Aswan pisi, mana yuyayniyuq kanki chayqa.
He kept coming.	Payqa sapa kutim hamurqa.
He is the real thing.	Payqa chiqap kaqmi kachkan.
It is best to do nothing.	Aswan allinqa mana imatapas ruwaymi.
That was, once upon a time.	Chayqa karqan, huk kuti.
Too much too much.	Llumpay llumpay.
He talks all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon riman.
And now it’s everywhere.	Hinaspa kunanqa maypipas kachkan.
I had to be quick.	Utqayllam kanay karqa.
I can’t tell anyone, not yet at least.	Manam pimanpas willayta atiymanchu, manaraqmi aswanpas.
That’s fast, for sure.	Chayqa utqaylla, seguro.
No, please .	Manan, ama hina kaspa .
The nicest house, the nicest house.	Aswan sumaq wasi, aswan sumaq wasi.
This was the second time.	Kayqa iskay kaq kutim karqa.
Of course, this wouldn’t be right.	Arí, kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Obviously this has to be there.	Sut’inmi kayqa chaypi kanan.
He never talked much.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas anchatachu rimarqan.
I think it's easy, man.	Facil kasqanmantam piensani, runa.
He knew, man.	Payqa yacharqanmi, runa.
But it won’t do very well.	Ichaqa manan ancha allintachu ruwanqa.
I may not have done anything wrong.	Manapaschá mana allintachu ruwarqani.
She was a girl this year.	Payqa kay wata sipasmi karqan.
This is where you do your best.	Kaypim aswan allinta ruwanki.
