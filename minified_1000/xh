Work progressed rapidly.	Umsebenzi waqhubeka ngokukhawuleza.
I'm trying to be your friend.	Ndizama ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
Like he can't.	Ngathi akakwazi.
Yes of course.	Ewe kunjalo.
I have never done this before.	Andizange ndiyenze le nto ngaphambili.
She's going to college soon.	Uya ekholejini kungekudala.
She is smart to him.	Ukrelekrele kuye.
I saw about you right away.	Ndibone ngawe kwangoko.
It will be good to see the truth.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukubona inyaniso.
You have to succeed.	Kufuneka uphumelele.
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nantso ke.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
I don’t know what’s wrong with this.	Andazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngale nto.
Good to see that.	Kuhle ukubona oko.
He went to her.	Waya kuye.
Sorry, but no.	Uxolo, kodwa hayi.
I don't think so.	Andiqondi ukuba kunjalo.
Obviously, this will take time.	Ngokucacileyo, oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
I will get a job.	Ndiza kufumana umsebenzi.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	Ngaloo ndlela uyakwazi ukwenza nantoni na ofuna ukuyenza.
He will not be gone very long.	Akayi kuhamba ixesha elide.
I look behind me.	Ndijonge emva kwam.
Absolutely good job.	Umsebenzi omhle ngokupheleleyo.
I like that, too.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto, nam.
I want to be with him more.	Ndifuna ukuba naye ngakumbi.
Yes, you read well.	Ewe, ufunda kakuhle.
Will you get better.	Ngaba uza kuba ngcono.
Looked up.	Wajonga phezulu.
You may still be doing that.	Nangoku usenokuba uyayenza loo nto.
Not his wife.	Hayi umfazi wakhe.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
I hope you did.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyenzile.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
He looked away.	Wajonga ecaleni.
His.	Yakhe.
I know my father.	Ndiyamazi utata.
That one is completely visible.	Lowo ubonakala ngokupheleleyo.
This or nothing.	Oku okanye akukho nto.
It will be good to know how to do it.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukwazi indlela yokwenza.
You might be right.	Usenokuba ulungile.
He is not here with me.	Akakho apha kum.
But there is a good sense.	Kodwa kukho ingqondo entle.
I did not know about all that.	Ndandingazi ngayo yonke loo nto.
But so far nothing has happened.	Kodwa okwangoku akukho nto yenzekileyo.
Help me! 	Ndincede!
He gave the ball to his son.	Wanika unyana wakhe ibhola.
He mentions his place.	Uthetha indawo yakhe.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
So, really, please.	Ngoko, ngokwenene, nceda.
I saw no other way.	Andizange ndibone enye indlela.
No no.	Hayi, hayi.
I learned a lot today at school.	Ndifunde kakhulu namhlanje esikolweni.
Or you can have anything.	Okanye unokuba nayo nantoni na.
Soon she heard about it.	Kungekudala weva ngayo.
Test, test, test.	Uvavanyo, uvavanyo, uvavanyo.
He does not even know what he will do when he gets there.	Akazi nokuba uza kwenza ntoni xa efika apho.
And there is no reason why it should be here.	Kwaye akukho sizathu sokuba kufuneka apha.
And he did.	Kwaye wenze njalo.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
Obviously you can't.	Ngokucacileyo awukwazi.
But only two days.	Kodwa kuphela iintsuku ezimbini.
That's the thing.	Nantso ke into.
Work.	Akazi.
You learn many things.	Ufunda izinto ezininzi.
I speak clearly.	Ndithetha ngokucacileyo.
I'm not sure how I feel about this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndiziva njani ngale nto.
That's the way.	Nantso indlela.
Thanks but no.	Enkosi kodwa hayi.
She goes to school.	Uya esikolweni.
But they said no.	Kodwa bathi hayi.
If he has to come to her.	Ukuba kufuneka afike kuye.
I'm glad to see you too.	Nam ndiyavuya ukubona.
Just help me.	Ndincede nje.
He didn't know it was time.	Wayengazi ukuba lixesha.
That's it, for sure.	Yiloo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
And clearly, he is very interesting.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo, unomdla kakhulu.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
I wish that could happen soon.	Ndinqwenela ukuba oko kwenzeke kungekudala.
It would take a lot of time.	Bekuya kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
Yes, no.	Ewe, hayi le.
I wish that was true.	Ndinqwenela ukuba yinyani leyo.
In the end, he could not think straight.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange akwazi ukucinga kakuhle.
So he does not know what he looks like.	Ngoko akakwazi ukuba ukhangeleka njani.
But for now, this time.	Kodwa okwangoku, ngeli xesha.
Maybe I don't know.	Mhlawumbi andazi.
He came home.	Wafika ekhaya.
Yeah yeah, obviously.	Ewe ewe, ngokucacileyo.
Did you sleep well?	Ingaba ulele kakuhle?
He asked me.	Wandicela.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
But it is not easy to do that.	Kodwa akukho lula ukwenza oko.
You would be perfectly fine there without me.	Uya kuba ulungile ngokupheleleyo phaya ngaphandle kwam.
He felt the need for his advice.	Waziva efuna icebiso lakhe.
I know now what it is.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba yintoni na.
Why do you want to do this?	Kutheni ufuna ukwenza oku?
I want to meet him.	Ndifuna ukudibana naye.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, ilungile.
The marriage is a success, however.	Umtshato uphumelele, nangona kunjalo.
There is good money to do there.	Kukho imali elungileyo yokwenza apho.
Don't do that.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto.
He did well, by the way.	Wenza kakuhle, ngendlela.
He tried but could not control himself.	Wazama kodwa akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
I want to tell you this.	Ndifuna ukukuxelela oku.
He never stopped at that, though.	Akazange ayeke kuloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
He opened the whole house.	Wavula indlu yonke.
He can't control himself.	Akakwazi ukuzibamba.
Not just for me.	Hayi nje ngam.
He opened the bar.	Wavula utywala.
She was afraid to speak.	Wayesoyika ukuthetha.
I know this.	Ndiyayazi le nto.
I want a party.	Ndifuna itheko.
I made a mistake.	Ndenze impazamo.
He looked down and saw something strange.	Wajonga phantsi wabona into engaqhelekanga.
Have you ever said anything?	Ngaba ukhe wathetha nto?
I really want him to be here.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba abe lapha.
To do something.	Ukwenza into.
Well, not at all.	Ewe, akunjalo kanye.
They lived here for many years.	Bahlala apha iminyaka emininzi.
You have to go now.	Kufuneka uhambe ngoku.
Whatever happens.	Nokuba yintoni na iya kwenzeka.
He thought he knew that way now.	Wayecinga ukuba uyayazi loo ndlela ngoku.
I have never said anything like that.	Zange ndithethe into enjalo.
Not that high.	Hayi ukuba phezulu.
Don't talk about it again.	Musa ukuthetha ngayo kwakhona.
He did not speak for long.	Akazange athethe ixesha elide.
All right, so there you are.	Kulungile, ngoko kukho loo nto.
Most of the time with him.	Ixesha elininzi kunye naye.
I want to try to say something now.	Ndifuna ukuzama ukuthetha into ngoku.
It just takes you.	Kuthatha wena nje.
We have to make a decision.	Kufuneka senze isigqibo.
He's here now.	Ulapha ngoku.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke.
He is intelligent.	Ukrelekrele.
He will have to do things.	Kuya kufuneka enze izinto.
At first, she was afraid to go out alone.	Ekuqaleni, wayesoyika ukuphuma yedwa.
You know it.	Uyakwazi.
Everyone knew the other.	Wonke umntu wayesazi omnye.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo.
Not reading.	Hayi ukufunda.
You have to go.	Kufuneka uhambe.
It takes too much.	Kuthatha into eninzi kakhulu.
I want you to look at this.	Ndifuna ujonge oku.
I thought you did too.	Bendicinga ukuba nawe wenze njalo.
Then he realized something.	Waza waqonda into ethile.
New money, of course.	Imali entsha, kunjalo.
That will be my job.	Oko kuya kuba ngumsebenzi wam.
Otherwise, you can't do that.	Ngaphandle koko, awukwazi ukwenza oko.
Do you think of something.	Ngaba ucinga ngento.
Doing the work.	Ukwenza umsebenzi.
I thought that was a good job.	Ndandicinga ukuba ngumsebenzi omhle lowo.
He decided to look for a new person.	Wagqiba ekubeni afune umntu omtsha.
He runs things here in town.	Uqhuba izinto apha edolophini.
He thought it would be so.	Wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Or anything before.	Okanye nantoni na ngaphambili.
Today, everyone does everything.	Namhlanje, wonke umntu wenza yonke into.
She is not.	Akakho.
But this does not have to be.	Kodwa oku akufuneki ukuba kube njalo.
I know it is very good.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
Not next to me.	Hayi ecaleni kwam.
I think he was scared.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesoyika.
And you did well.	Kwaye wenze kakuhle.
It would be good to say more.	Bekuya kuba kuhle ukuthetha ngakumbi.
To know more about.	Ukwazi ngakumbi malunga.
Nobody ever went there.	Akukho mntu wakha waya apho.
Well, tell me.	Ke, ndixelele.
I should have known.	Bekufanele ndiyazi.
But he is afraid.	Kodwa uyoyika.
Then he said he would do it.	Emva koko wathi uza kuyenza.
Only not today.	Kuphela hayi namhlanje.
Or think of many other things, though.	Okanye ucinge ezinye izinto ezininzi, nokuba.
Maybe he didn't know either.	Mhlawumbi naye wayengazi.
He knew about her.	Wayesazi ngaye.
He is.	Unjalo.
I am here for work.	Ndilapha ngomsebenzi.
And before that, one.	Kwaye ngaphambi koko, enye.
And that's exactly it.	Kwaye yiloo nto kanye.
He finally got help.	Ekugqibeleni wafumana uncedo.
But he could not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
He ate alone.	Watya yedwa.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
I don't even remember what exactly happened.	Andikhumbuli nokuba kwenzeke ntoni kanye kanye.
That starts tomorrow.	Oko kuqala ngomso.
So there are a lot of questions, a lot of them.	Ngoko kukho imibuzo emininzi, emininzi.
He is like you.	Ufana nawe.
You are very successful.	Uphumelele kakhulu.
I think he would like to die a lot.	Ndicinga ukuba angathanda ukufa kakhulu.
he asked.	wabuza.
He did not want to know.	Wayengafuni ukwazi.
I had to wait another few days.	Kwafuneka ndilinde ezinye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
We want you to do that.	Sifuna ukuba wenze oko.
And someone else.	Kwaye omnye umntu.
I'm sure that would be fine.	Ndiqinisekile oko kuya kuba kuhle.
I mean a lot.	Ndithetha kakhulu.
I know it and you know it.	Ndiyayazi kwaye nawe uyayazi.
Pretending to be you will happen too.	Ukwenza ngathi nawe kuya kwenzeka.
After a while he asked.	Emva kwexesha wabuza.
But, that's fine.	Kodwa, kulungile.
He wants me to stay.	Ufuna ndihlale.
I do not believe you have succeeded.	Andikholelwa ukuba uphumelele.
I am here to stay.	Ndilapha ukuhlala.
Yes, there is much more.	Ewe, kukho okuninzi ngakumbi.
Right now, that's right.	Kanye ngoku, kunjalo.
I spoke to him early today.	Ndithethe naye kwangethuba namhlanje.
He wanted to make his life your life.	Wayefuna ukwenza ubomi bakhe nawe.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I have to tell her.	Kufuneka ndimxelele.
I like this place.	Ndiyayithanda le ndawo.
No one will speak.	Akukho mntu uya kuthetha.
We'll talk about that later.	Siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube.
I think we better go here.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono sihambe apha.
I was hopeful.	Bendinethemba.
No one saw anything wrong with it.	Akukho mntu wabona into engalunganga kuyo.
But money will be fun.	Kodwa imali iya kuba mnandi.
But it does take time.	Kodwa kuthatha ixesha.
I know he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguye.
He is moving very fast.	Uhamba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
There is no one in it.	Akukho mntu kuyo.
Or to me.	Okanye kum.
He hoped you had done the right thing.	Wayenethemba lokuba wenze into elungileyo.
He said it was true.	Wathi yinyani.
This will happen now.	Oku kuya kwenzeka ngoku.
I thought this was good.	Bendicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
I can't speak right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngoku.
That would be great.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle.
And she loves it.	Kwaye uyayithanda.
You never said much to me.	Zange uthethe kakhulu kum.
And it will be.	Kwaye kuya kuba njalo.
Really good question.	Umbuzo omhle ngenene.
I tried and tried.	Ndazama ndazama.
Thank you so much for everything !.	Enkosi kakhulu ngayo yonke into !.
I just got home.	Ndifike nje endlini.
He was nowhere.	Wayengekho ndawo.
It looks good when you do it that way.	Kubonakala kulungile xa uyenza ngolo hlobo.
And she is right.	Kwaye ulungile.
I'm glad he finally did something at home.	Ndiyavuya kuba ekugqibeleni enze into ekhaya.
It gets a lot easier after that.	Kuba lula kakhulu emva koko.
To do this.	Ukuze wenze oku.
You know, always.	Uyazi, rhoqo.
But! 	Kodwa!
at last.	ekugqibeleni.
But you are also human.	Kodwa nawe ungumntu.
You don’t want to, though.	Awufuni, nangona kunjalo.
But don't say it.	Kodwa musa ukuyithetha.
He will return at the end.	Uya kubuya ekugqibeleni.
He heard something.	Weva into.
.	.
All the time, whatever it is.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, nokuba yintoni na.
He spent his whole life here!	Wachitha bonke ubomi bakhe apha!
We want you to go with us.	Sifuna ukuba uhambe nathi.
He is not human.	Akangomntu.
He did not eat for a few days.	Akazange atye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
He does not want to leave.	Akafuni ukuhamba.
He said he never spoke again.	Wathi akazange aphinde athethe.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
I'm waiting for you.	Ndilinde wena.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
To me, death is very good.	Kum, ukufa kuhle kakhulu.
No one, ever.	Akukho mntu, nanini na.
I didn't think of anything else.	Khange ndicinge enye into.
And that is exactly what is happening now.	Kwaye yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo ngoku.
Everyone is doing it now.	Wonke umntu uyayenza ngoku.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
All is well and good.	Konke kulungile kwaye kulungile.
But it is not easy.	Kodwa akukho lula.
I'm sure there is something wrong with that, too.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho into engalunganga apho, nathi.
You do not think.	Awucingi.
Time to do something.	Ixesha lokwenza into.
Yes, we will continue.	Ewe, siza kuqhubeka.
This is not going to be good.	Oku akuyi kuba kuhle.
And not always.	Kwaye hayi rhoqo.
Good for us.	Kuhle kuthi.
But not dad.	Kodwa hayi utata.
I'm glad you're here at last.	Ndiyavuya ulapha ekugqibeleni.
I sit down next to him.	Ndihlala phantsi ecaleni kwakhe.
I do not know.	Andazi.
She saw my mother.	Wabona umama.
I try to do it this way.	Ndizama ukuyenza ngolu hlobo.
I thought you did a really good job there.	Ndandicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu apho.
I think you hurt.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze buhlungu.
Yes he knew.	Ewe wayesazi.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
You cannot succeed.	Awunako ukuphumelela.
I did not know who I was or my life.	Ndandingazi ukuba mna okanye ubomi bam.
I'm doing well.	Ndiyenza kakuhle.
I have to go.	Kufuneka ndihambe.
Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga njalo.
He knew he wouldn't tell her anything.	Wayesazi ukuba akayi kumxelela nto.
No, nothing tonight.	Hayi, akukho nto ngokuhlwanje.
How wonderful that can be.	Kunokuba mnandi kangakanani oko.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
He never said much about you.	Zange athethe kakhulu ngawe.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
You in the car.	Wena emotweni.
He looked here at me.	Wajonga apha kum.
He speaks softly.	Uthetha kancinci.
This is our first job tonight.	Lo ngumsebenzi wethu wokuqala ngokuhlwanje.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange.
What today.	Yintoni namhlanje.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Ndiyavuya ulapha kunye nam.
she did not tell anyone.	khange axelele mntu.
I can't get enough.	Andikwazi kufumana ngokwaneleyo.
Or could it be.	Okanye ingaba.
He wishes for peace.	Unqwenela uxolo.
This he did not do.	Oku akazange akwenze.
He goes with her.	Uhamba naye.
No one should do that.	Akukho mntu ufanele enze ngolo hlobo.
Name at last.	Igama ekugqibeleni.
That is a mistake.	Yiyo ke impazamo.
This really did not happen.	Oku ngokwenene akuzange kwenzeke.
Not now or not.	Hayi ngoku okanye hayi.
I did it with it.	Ndiyenzile ngayo.
He is coming to you.	Uza kuwe.
Probably, you have gone too far.	Mhlawumbi, uye wahamba kakhulu.
They will come to you.	Baya kuza kuwe.
It's really good.	Ilungile ngokwenene.
You just play everything.	Udlala nje yonke into.
I want everyone there.	Ndifuna wonke umntu apho.
Some hours maybe.	Ezinye iiyure mhlawumbi.
He just asked questions.	Wabuza nje imibuzo.
That is what you will do.	Oko uya kukwenza.
He lives there, alone.	Uhlala apho, yedwa.
Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
Thank you to everyone for making it happen.	Enkosi kuye wonke umntu ngokwenza ukuba yenzeke.
As for.	Ngoko.
Yeah, maybe that one.	Ewe, mhlawumbi lowo.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Ndiyathandabuza, kodwa mhlawumbi.
We need to do better.	Kufuneka senze ngcono.
So it is you.	Ngoko nguwe.
I was thinking about that.	Bendicinga ngalonto.
That's the way it is here.	Kunjalo ke apha.
The woman is a doctor.	Umfazi ngugqirha.
But he did nothing.	Kodwa akazange enze nto.
After that, we will have to leave.	Emva koko, kuya kufuneka sihambe.
And it is not.	Kwaye akunjalo.
It gets easier.	Kuba lula.
You are to me, I am to you.	Nguwe lo kum, mna kuye.
Unless it is.	Ngaphandle kokuba kunjalo.
And this is happening now.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka ngoku.
To you, if possible.	Kuwe, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I know his mother.	Ndiyamazi umama wakhe.
He didn't know it was him.	Wayengazi ukuba nguye.
Well if you don't want to talk.	Kulungile ukuba awufuni kuthetha.
Yes, we know.	Ewe, siyazi.
This will be very painful.	Oku kuya kuba buhlungu kakhulu.
He works really hard.	Usebenza nzima ngenene.
I don't have to learn anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndifunde nantoni na.
One saw the house.	Omnye wabona indlu.
He spoke softly, clearly.	Wathetha kancinci, ngokucacileyo.
I just know.	Ndiyazi nje.
No, really, I have to.	Hayi, ngenene, kufuneka.
He walked slowly back up.	Wahamba kancinci wabuyela phezulu.
Not that he would ever do that.	Akunjalo ukuba uya kuze enze njalo.
He died that night.	Wafa ebusuku.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.
Tell me something new.	Ndixelele into entsha.
You know very well.	Uyazi kakhulu.
He did not eat at home.	Akazange atye ekhaya.
Not at the time, he thought.	Hayi ngelo xesha, wacinga njalo.
My son once said a lot to me.	Unyana wam wakha wathetha kakhulu kum.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
He is not, however.	Ayinguye, nangona kunjalo.
Probably everyone.	Mhlawumbi bonke abantu.
He wants to meet you.	Ufuna ukudibana nawe.
He left the house then.	Waphuma endlini ngoko.
She wanted to go to school.	Wayefuna ukuya esikolweni.
Or 'only'.	Okanye 'kuphela'.
Better by the way.	Ngcono ngendlela.
It is better to have it.	Kungcono ukuba nayo.
I will do the right thing.	Ndiza kwenza into elungileyo.
And so it takes time.	Kwaye ngoko kuthatha ixesha.
You know how this will end.	Uyazi ukuba oku kuya kuphela njani.
But, you know,.	Kodwa, uyazi,.
He looked back.	Wajonga ngasemva.
I am human, and I am human.	Ndingumntu, kwaye ndingumntu.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
But alone.	Kodwa ndedwa.
Or he will not do it.	Okanye akayi kwenza.
He will stay here for two weeks.	Uza kuhlala iiveki ezimbini apha.
But not just any book.	Kodwa hayi nje nayiphi na incwadi.
He did not say so anyway.	Akazange athethe njalo nangona kunjalo.
I'll take his room.	Ndiza kuthatha igumbi lakhe.
Nobody likes to do this work.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukwenza lo msebenzi.
Another mistake.	Enye impazamo.
He thought it might be the person.	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguye loo mntu.
There is something wrong with all of this.	Kukho into embi ngayo yonke le nto.
I will not go.	Andiyi kuhamba.
He's going tonight.	Uya ngokuhlwanje.
For us, it was not a bad thing though.	Kuthi, akuzange kube yinto embi nangona kunjalo.
He must learn to control his emotions.	Kufuneka afunde ukuzibamba.
he said.	uthe.
I apologize for any inconvenience.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo nayiphi na ingxaki.
Now, of course, we know better.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, siyazi ngcono.
But this is possible.	Kodwa oku kunokwenzeka.
I mean, a lot of money.	Ndithetha, imali eninzi.
In case.	Mhlawumbi.
All the time.	Lonke ixesha.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
Well, that's all true.	Ewe, yonke loo nto yinyani.
That's the way to do it.	Nantso indlela yokwenza.
However, he never spoke to me again.	Nangona kunjalo akazange aphinde athethe nam.
My mother told me about it.	Umama wandixelela ngayo.
And he just took it from you.	Kwaye wathatha nje kuwe.
But he did, of course.	Kodwa uyenzile, kunjalo.
And you may be.	Kwaye usenokuba.
Because it is so beautiful.	Ngenxa yokuba mhle kakhulu.
I have to help with that.	Ndifanele ukunceda kuloo nto.
His way.	Indlela yakhe.
He told her and she left.	Wamxelela ke wahamba.
I'm thinking of taking a job here.	Ndicinga ukuthatha umsebenzi apha.
Death seemed to him.	Ukufa kwakubonakala ngathi nguye.
But, and so on.	Kodwa, kwaye ngoko.
Your wife, you love her.	Umfazi wakho, uyamthanda.
You will probably come back to find out more.	Mhlawumbi uya kubuya ukufumana okuninzi ngakumbi.
It's just nothing.	Akukho nto nje.
That's the way it is now.	Kunjalo ke ngoku.
That looks great.	Oko kubonakala kakhulu.
It starts with going to jail.	Kuqala ukuya entolongweni.
No problem, just a few questions.	Akukho ngxaki, imibuzo nje embalwa.
It seemed impossible.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
It's me, you know.	Ndim, uyazi.
You need to do it fast.	Kufuneka uyenze ngokukhawuleza.
I'm just starting out.	Ndiyaqala nje.
Clearly, he did not.	Ngokucacileyo, akenzanga njalo.
Okay for me.	Kulungile ngam.
We had to do that.	Kwafuneka senze njalo.
He never did.	Akazange ayenze.
I do not know better.	Andazi ngcono.
I came here.	Ndize apha.
And suddenly.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
And how much.	Kwaye kangakanani.
You never thought about it.	Zange ucinge ngayo.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
At school.	Esikolweni.
I'm not sure where the other one went.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba omnye waya phi.
I don't know what her problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
I haven't done that yet.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto okwangoku.
He does not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
Soon, everyone will do it.	Kungekudala, bonke baya kuyenza.
You made a mistake.	Wenza impazamo.
So no problem there.	Ngoko akukho ngxaki apho.
And many, many more.	Kwaye abaninzi, abaninzi ngakumbi.
This would be great.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle.
You only need money for three weeks.	Ufuna imali kuphela iiveki ezintathu.
But it will be fun to try to find an answer together.	Kodwa kuya kuba mnandi ukuzama ukufumana impendulo kunye.
I'm not sure if it's right.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ilungile.
I'm waiting to see what happens.	Ndilinde ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Just tell me what's going on with you.	Ndixelele nje kuqhubeka ntoni ngawe.
I knew it all the time.	Ndandisazi ngalo lonke ixesha.
This is something new for me.	Yinto entsha le kum.
So it takes time.	Ngoko kuthatha ixesha.
I have never done any before.	Andizange ndenze nayiphi na ngaphambili.
He never spoke to me.	Zange athethe nam.
I think that's me.	Ndicinga ukuba ndim lowo.
And he did so.	Wayenza ke loo nto.
I never knew you before.	Andizange ndikwazi ngaphambili.
I felt it myself.	Ndive ngokwam.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
Too many people.	Abantu abaninzi kakhulu.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
If you are doing this, do not give up.	Ukuba wenza oku, musa ukuyeka.
But now he realized that he was too old.	Kodwa ngoku waqonda ukuba mdala kakhulu.
It's hard to see.	Kunzima ukubona.
Your work, my man.	Umsebenzi wakho, mntu wam.
I think that's a bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi.
But not just work.	Kodwa hayi umsebenzi kuphela.
It had to be that way.	Bekufanele kube njalo ke.
no.	hayi.
I asked to help.	Ndacela ukunceda.
And he does not want to eat.	Kwaye akafuni kutya.
I mean.	Ndithetha mna.
I never talked about it.	Khange ndithethe ngayo.
Then some more.	Emva koko ezinye ngakumbi.
Very nice speech, though.	Intetho entle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I would do something like that.	Ndiya kwenza into enjalo.
Again, too long.	Kwakhona, ixesha elide kakhulu.
Maybe you will get help either.	Mhlawumbi uya kufumana uncedo okanye.
He has left.	Uye wahamba.
A few years.	Iminyaka embalwa.
I don't think we're going to talk about it right now.	Andiqondi ukuba siza kuthetha ngayo okwangoku.
I'll be back, but for now.	Ndiya kubuya, kodwa okwangoku.
And then,	Ke ngoku,
So another time.	Ngoko elinye ixesha.
Work to do.	Umsebenzi ukwenza.
We had better go.	Kungcono sihambe.
Because something is wrong.	Kuba kukho into embi.
I thought about him a lot.	Ndandicinga ngaye kakhulu.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
You are not going there.	Awuyi apho.
For now.	Okwangoku nje.
I told her so.	Ndamxelela njalo.
This is very difficult at first.	Oku kunzima kakhulu ekuqaleni.
And at school.	Kwaye esikolweni.
Image, please.	Umfanekiso, nceda.
He did not stay there long.	Akazange apho ixesha elide.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
Or mom.	Okanye umama.
That did not happen.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto ke.
And this way too.	Kwaye ngale ndlela kwakhona.
He will not be now.	Akayi kuba ngoku.
But that person will not be me.	Kodwa loo mntu akayi kuba ndim.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Not right.	Hayi kulungile.
There is a lot of money out there.	Kukho imali eninzi apha phandle.
He asked.	Uye wabuza.
But other than that, it's very good.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko, ilungile kakhulu.
She told her son.	Waxelela unyana wakhe.
It'll take time, you know.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha, uyazi.
He never looked up.	Zange wajonga phezulu.
Not at all.	Akunjalo konke konke.
That happened today.	Kwenzeke loo nto namhlanje.
And that's a big deal.	Kwaye yinto enkulu leyo.
I made another sense.	Ndenza enye ingqondo.
I'm sure you will want to stay in college.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kufuna ukuba uhlale ekholejini.
And some did not.	Kwaye abanye abazange.
Something happened.	Kukho into eyenzekayo.
But because of us, today it is hard to find.	Kodwa ngenxa yethu, namhlanje kunzima ukufumana.
It's just, something about him.	Yinto nje, into ethile ngaye.
I want to talk to you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe.
What's this? 	Yintoni le?
I've heard that now.	Ndive lonto ngoku.
I'm sure you can.	Ndiqinisekile ungayenza.
They sat down and opened it.	Bahlala phantsi wavula.
if any.	ukuba nayiphi na.
I thought.	Ndicinge.
He left just as he had done.	Wemka kanye emva kokuba wenze.
Lots of play.	Ukudlala okuninzi.
They live in us.	Bahlala kuthi.
Maybe a week later.	Mhlawumbi iveki emva kwexesha.
Although getting there will not be easy.	Nangona ukuya apho akuyi kuba lula.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
He went the other way.	Wahamba ngenye indlela.
It comes down a bit.	Iza kancinci.
Her father again.	Utata wakhe kwakhona.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
There was nothing there.	Kwakungekho nto apho.
I go to work every day.	Ndiya emsebenzini yonke imihla.
Something very bad happened.	Kwenzeke into embi kakhulu.
Not for me.	Akukho kum.
He will wait.	Uya kulinda.
Not too far away.	Hayi kude kakhulu.
He spoke slowly, but clearly.	Wathetha kancinci, kodwa ngokucacileyo.
Just give me this.	Ndinike nje oku.
Are you ready for this.	Ngaba ukulungele oku.
But he is.	Kodwa unjalo.
He leaves in the morning.	Uhamba ekuseni.
I am too.	Nam Oku kwam.
I don't know anyone.	Andazi mntu.
I don't even care how it happened.	Andikhathali nokuba kwenzeke njani.
I really want to buy everything.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthenga yonke into.
I do not know what you are talking about!	Andazi ke ukuba uthetha ngantoni!
And then I'm tired.	Kwaye ke ndidiniwe.
I do not want anyone.	Andifuni mntu.
But he had to do it.	Kodwa kwafuneka enjenjalo.
One wants his own finish.	Omnye ufuna ukugqiba kwakhe.
But he will do it.	Kodwa uya kukwenza.
Tell people what is happening.	Xelela abantu ngento eyenzekayo.
For both of us.	Kuthi sobabini.
That's fine.	Nto leyo ilungile.
He left quickly.	Wahamba ngokukhawuleza.
I'm afraid to go out.	Ndiyoyika ukuphuma.
He never talked about you.	Akazange athethe ngawe.
Whatever happens.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
And he saw why.	Kwaye wabona ukuba kutheni.
I didn't even know you were here.	Bendingazi nokuba ulapha.
That's really hard.	Oko kunzima ngokwenene.
Then you come to the right place.	Emva koko ufike kwindawo elungileyo.
We'll see what happens.	Siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Everyone wants to play.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukudlala.
Do you have to go?	Ngaba kufuneka uhambe?
Then you have to tell him.	Emva koko kufuneka umxelele.
But marriage is a big deal.	Kodwa umtshato yinto enkulu.
You think more.	Ucinga ngakumbi.
Age.	Iminyaka.
This is not the only thing.	Ayisiyiyo le nto kuphela.
I look at things here.	Ndijonge izinto apha.
He came and sat down late.	Uye wafika wahlala phantsi emva kwexesha.
Everyone in town loves him.	Wonke umntu edolophini uyamthanda.
Shopping here is fine.	Ukuthenga apha kulungile.
Maybe not so much, maybe too long.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu, mhlawumbi ixesha elide.
My father spoke first.	Utata wathetha kuqala.
Very good for you !!.	Kuhle kakhulu kuwe !!.
He wanted the night.	Wayefuna ubusuku.
All but one.	Bonke ngaphandle komnye.
He didn't want to give up, he almost didn't.	Wayengafuni ukuyeka, phantse akazange.
There is a reason.	Kukho isizathu.
He did not know.	Akazange azi.
You won't do it.	Awuyi kuyenza.
He deserves it too.	Ufanele nawe.
He hoped it didn't happen.	Wayenethemba lokuba khange kube njalo.
I thought we did a really good job.	Ndandicinga ukuba senze umsebenzi omhle ngokwenene.
He told me.	Wandixelela .
How long will it take?	Iza kuthatha ixesha elingakanani?
This time now.	Ngeli xesha ngoku.
No one will come.	Akukho namnye uya kuza.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
I want you to think about it.	Ndifuna ucinge ngayo.
Many more.	Ezininzi ngakumbi.
It comes down.	Iza phantsi.
He seemed to be talking.	Wayebonakala ethetha.
I don't really know why.	Andazi ngenene ukuba kutheni.
He just did it.	Uyenzile nje.
I mean not.	Ndithetha ukuba akunjalo.
There is help out there, really !!.	Kukho uncedo apho, inyani !!.
It seemed like a long time.	Kwakubonakala ngathi lixesha elide.
She tries to decide whether to tell her something or not.	Uzama ukwenza isigqibo sokuba amxelele into ethile okanye hayi.
I thought you felt the same way.	Bendicinga ukuba nawe uziva ngendlela efanayo.
It does happen, though.	Kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba uya kuba lapho.
You will get a job again.	Uza kufumana umsebenzi kwakhona.
We'll see about that.	Siza kubona ngaloo nto.
Bad thing.	Into embi.
It will mean more than you know !.	Kuya kuthetha ngaphezu kokuba uyazi!.
But that.	Kodwa ukuba.
And he never came.	Kwaye akazange eze.
I am here tomorrow.	Ndilapha ngomso.
I thought you might like to try it.	Bendicinga ungathanda ukuzama.
I did the same.	Nam ndenza njalo.
It could be anyone.	Inokuba ngubani na.
Making a meal will be fun.	Ukwenza isidlo kuya kuba mnandi.
I like coffee.	Ndiyayithanda ikofu.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, uyenzile.
I am excited to discover something new.	Ndiyavuya ukufumana into entsha.
That's why he wants to come here.	Yiyo loo nto efuna ukuza apha.
mother.	umama.
I will be too.	Nam ndiya kuba njalo.
Yes, thank you for that.	Ewe, enkosi ngaloo nto.
Not now, not yet.	Hayi ngoku, hayi okwangoku.
And if you don't want to.	Kwaye ukuba awufuni.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
I knew he did one.	Bendisazi ukuba wenza enye.
Everything will be fine.	Yonke into iya kuhamba kakuhle.
However, that's it.	Nangona kunjalo, yiloo nto.
He can read books.	Uyakwazi ukufunda iincwadi.
Watch and watch your dog.	Jonga kwaye ujonge inja yakho.
Because it is.	Kuba kunjalo.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
He is really trying.	Uzama ngenene.
Then, he does something very strange.	Emva koko, wenza into engaqhelekanga.
I am here.	Ndilapha.
I am not in prison.	Andikho entolongweni.
Really, we know.	Ngokwenene, siyazi.
It will be good.	Kuya kuba kuhle.
Me and me and me and me.	Mna kunye nam kunye nam kunye nam.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.
And he talked about it.	Kwaye wathetha ngayo.
This is going to happen.	Le nto iya kwenzeka.
But now, nothing.	Kodwa ngoku, akukho nto.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
Everyone is looking for something.	Wonke umntu ujonge into ethile.
Or food.	Okanye ukutya.
She did what she could to help.	Wenza konke okusemandleni akhe ukuze ancede.
It's true now.	Yinyani ngoku.
Image last week.	Umfanekiso kwiveki ephelileyo.
And what one wants.	Kwaye yintoni umntu ayifunayo.
I want to buy with my own money.	Ndifuna ukuthenga ngemali yam.
No one would say anything.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuthetha nto.
Long.	Mde.
But this will take time.	Kodwa oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
Or as long as you stay.	Okanye ixesha elide uhlala.
It can be anything or anyone.	Inokuba yiyo nantoni na okanye nabani na.
I do not know how this can happen.	Andazi ukuba kunokwenzeka njani oku.
Not before, but after.	Hayi ngaphambili, kodwa emva kwakhe.
And it is possible to talk to her.	Kwaye kunokwenzeka ukuba uthethe nayo.
Now, if that's what you want to say, fine.	Ngoku, ukuba yiloo nto ofuna ukuyithetha, kulungile.
I'm not sure it's possible.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kunokwenzeka.
No one spoke to her like that.	Akukho mntu wathetha naye ngolo hlobo.
But he was speaking out.	Kodwa wayethetha phandle.
I can’t be with him and do a lot.	Andikwazi ukuba kunye naye kwaye ndenze okuninzi.
That really is not possible.	Oko ngenene akunakwenzeka.
I think that's probably wrong with me.	Ndicinga ukuba mhlawumbi yiloo nto engalunganga kum.
Maybe he would talk to her.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuthetha naye.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But in this case it is really difficult.	Kodwa kule meko kunzima ngokwenene.
He thought something good.	Wacinga into entle.
And then another.	Kwaye ke enye.
I will have my friends.	Ndiya kuba nabahlobo bam.
This is it.	Le yile.
Not so bad.	Hayi kakhulu ngendlela embi.
I've never been here before.	Andizange ndibe apha ngaphambili.
He is invisible.	Akabonakali.
Or his son.	Okanye unyana wakhe.
But he does not want to.	Kodwa akafuni.
It will never be enough.	Soze ngokwaneleyo kulungile.
This, of course, should not happen.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akufanele kwenzeke.
Some, but not all.	Abanye, kodwa hayi bonke.
I couldn't do it for him.	Andikwazanga ukwenza kuye.
She hopes that one day she will have children of her own.	Unethemba lokuba ngenye imini uya kuba nabantwana bakhe.
I wanted to sit down and think a little.	Bendifuna ukuhlala phantsi ndicinge kancinci.
Work is busy here.	Umsebenzi uxakekile apha.
On my own.	Ngokwam.
I never heard from again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndive.
Maybe they will go.	Mhlawumbi baya kuhamba.
I wanted to die.	Ndandifuna ukufa.
And that's fine.	Kwaye ilungile.
I wish it were easier, for him.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube lula, ngaye.
I have never been one to do that.	Andizange ndibe ngumntu owenza loo nto.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
So he ate breakfast.	Watya ke isidlo sakusasa.
He always talks.	Uhlala ethetha.
I will never do that again.	Soze ndiphinde ndiyenze lonto.
Certainly there are questions.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho imibuzo.
I hope you like it !.	Ndiyathemba uyayithanda!.
Looking for a new way.	Ufuna indlela entsha.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I can't wait to learn more from you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda okuninzi ngakumbi kuwe.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
In one place.	Kwindawo enye.
That is exactly what happened to him.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kuye.
All night, really.	Ubusuku bonke, ngokwenene.
So just in time.	Ngoko kanye ngexesha.
Don't forget your umbrella.	Ungalibali iambrela yakho.
He did not have to go far.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba aye kude.
We've done it before.	Senze ngaphambili.
Death comes quickly and often.	Ukufa kuza ngokukhawuleza kwaye rhoqo.
Whether you spend less or less.	Nokuba uchitha kancinci okanye kakhulu.
He told me he had done it.	Undixelele ukuba uyenzile.
But there is no way to actually do that.	Kodwa akukho ndlela yokwenza oko ngokwenene.
That has never happened before.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto ngaphambili.
He left you.	Wemka kuwe.
Today, not tomorrow.	Namhlanje, hayi ngomso.
Just a little something.	Into encinci nje.
That's not my thing.	Asiyonto yam leyo.
I hope you are right.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ulungile.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
He came to live in the city.	Weza kuhlala edolophini.
Not only that, though.	Akunjalo kuphela, nangona kunjalo.
We will leave in time.	Siza kuhamba kwangethuba.
What are they doing?.	Ingaba wenza ntoni?.
Then you do it again.	Emva koko uyayenza kwakhona.
Eventually he died.	Ekugqibeleni wafa.
I think this is really the case.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kunjalo ngokwenene.
It's good to go.	Kuhle ukuhamba.
That will do well.	Oko kuya kwenza kakuhle.
I looked away from him.	Ndijonge kude kuye.
It is possible that some people will need more space.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba abanye abantu baya kufuna indawo eninzi.
I look back.	Ndijonge ngasemva.
I don't know what's right.	Andazi ukuba yintoni elungileyo.
That's what you need to do.	Nantso into ekufuneka uyenzile.
Then he did not go.	Emva koko akazange aye.
he will certainly come.	ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuza.
And there is a problem with us.	Kwaye kukho ingxaki nathi.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange ayenze loo nto.
That is our plan.	Licebo lethu elo.
Today, it seems, it never happened.	Namhlanje, ngathi akuzange kwenzeke.
Almost all of us.	Phantse sonke.
You should go to college.	Ufanele ukuba uye ekholejini.
No one is out.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle.
So he did.	Ngoko wenza njalo.
He went to bed this morning.	Uye walala ngoku kusasa.
I will not have it.	Andiyi kuba nayo.
If he was going to talk to her like that.	Ukuba wayeza kuthetha naye ngolo hlobo.
He was really scared.	Wayesoyika ngokwenene.
It never happened.	Akuzange kube njalo.
We will do it again this week.	Siza kuyenza kwakhona kule veki.
I want to win today.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela namhlanje.
But only here.	Kodwa apha kuphela.
You feel better.	Uziva ngcono.
He did it himself.	Uyenzile ngokwakhe.
So, that's right.	Ngoko, kunjalo.
Now my problem is this.	Ngoku ingxaki yam yile.
Probably not all.	Mhlawumbi hayi yonke.
It's so much better.	Kungcono kakhulu.
I'm sorry about that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngaloo nto.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
If so, what is the best way to do this?	Ukuba kunjalo, yeyiphi indlela yokwenza oku.
I did not go home.	Khange ndiye ekhaya.
That is definitely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo.
When he wants something, he wants it done.	Xa efuna into ethile, ufuna yenziwe.
His mother.	Umama wakhe.
Not when you think about it.	Hayi xa ucinga ngayo.
A little bit, too.	Kancinci kancinci, kwakhona.
I will not be.	Andiyi kuba.
You can be alone.	Unokuba yedwa.
I want my room.	Ndifuna igumbi lam.
He told her never to do that again.	Wamxelela ukuba angaphindi ayenze loo nto.
He was very angry about what had happened.	Waba nomsindo kakhulu ngale nto yenzekileyo.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
And that is not yet.	Kwaye oko akukho okwangoku.
Not so here, though.	Akunjalo apha, nangona kunjalo.
He did not want her to do this.	Wayengafuni ukuba ayenze le nto.
He does this all the time.	Uyenza le nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
He admitted that he had made mistakes.	Wavuma ukuba wenze iimpazamo.
I do not like this.	Andiyithandi le nto.
I don't know when.	Andazi ukuba nini.
It’s not my thing, though.	Asiyonto yam, nangona kunjalo.
Or something completely different.	Okanye enye into ngokupheleleyo.
Or not.	Okanye hayi.
In this case, not so much.	Kule meko, hayi kakhulu.
But this is not really the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
It could be a lot more.	Inokuba kakhulu ngakumbi.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
That was not necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
You will not succeed.	Awuyi kuphumelela.
Then go to work.	Emva koko uye emsebenzini.
We did all this in the morning.	Siyenze yonke lento ekuseni.
Well, a lot of things.	Kulungile, izinto ezininzi.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He has to stay there, for now.	Kufuneka ahlale apho, okwangoku.
Or just outside.	Okanye ngaphandle nje.
He can't sit still.	Akakwazi ukuhlala.
No one has ever done that before.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza loo nto ngaphambili.
He thought about that.	Wacinga ngaloo nto.
Unless you are a human being.	Ngaphandle kokuba ungumntu.
I can not stop thinking about you.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngawe.
But he agreed.	Kodwa wavuma.
What did I ask for?	Ndacela ntoni.
But he was not in it or in it.	Kodwa wayengekho kuyo okanye kuyo.
Do you probably expect.	Ngaba mhlawumbi ulindele.
He came in once.	Wangena kanye.
Tell me the truth.	Ndixelele inyani.
So he was not alone.	Ngoko yayingenguye yedwa.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
First wife.	Umfazi wokuqala.
He doesn't look good.	Akabonakali kakuhle.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
Now you know why.	Ngoku uyazi ukuba kutheni.
I have to stay.	Kufuneka ndihlale.
Either way, it is the same truth.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, yinyani efanayo.
Waiting for an answer.	Ulindele impendulo.
I think it is impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
He read quickly.	Wafunda ngokukhawuleza.
I'd like that, too.	Ndingathanda oko, nam.
That's right.	Kunjalo ke.
As much as you like.	Kangangoko uthanda.
I knew there was another.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho enye.
He did not want her to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.
Yes that's right.	Ewe oko kulungile.
I didn't want you to do this.	Bendingafuni wena lento.
I'm trying to think of something else.	Ndizama ukucinga ngenye into.
I mean, absolutely.	Ndiya kuthetha, ngokupheleleyo nje.
There is work.	Kukho umsebenzi.
My man.	Umntu wam .
If you really want to, you will.	Ukuba ufuna ngokwenene, uya kwenza njalo.
So for him, there was no question.	Ngoko kuye, kwakungekho mbuzo.
I only came to say it.	Ndize kuthetha yona kuphela.
And that way.	Kwaye ngaloo ndlela.
It's hard to talk about it.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngayo.
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
Something happened.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo.
Now he knew better.	Ngoku wayesazi ngcono.
We'll get there.	Siza kufika apho.
Then just right for you.	Emva koko kanye kuwe.
You may have done this before.	Umele ukuba uyenzile le nto ngaphambili.
We will continue.	Siza kuqhubeka.
But you don't have to stay if you don't want to.	Kodwa akufuneki uhlale ukuba awufuni.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Kwakungekho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
They all sit down.	Bahlala phantsi bonke.
I want some.	Ndifuna ezinye.
I have been thinking about this place a lot lately.	Bendicinga ngale ndawo kakhulu mva nje.
This is who you want to be.	Nguwe lo ufuna ukuba nguye.
I suspect that, sooner or later, they will try again.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba, kungekudala okanye kamva, baya kuzama kwakhona.
But you want food.	Kodwa ufuna ukutya.
People go to town to buy.	Abantu baya edolophini ukuya kuthenga.
I’d love to take it someday, though.	Ndingathanda ukuthatha ngenye imini, nangona kunjalo.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
Above all.	Ngaphezu koko.
I had to do this myself.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze ngokwam le nto.
He had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
Good job on this !.	Mhle umsebenzi kule!.
I told you we should have gone earlier.	Ndikuxelele ukuba bekufanele ukuba siye ngaphambili.
Then he said.	Emva koko wathi.
Only when necessary.	Kuphela xa kufuneka.
All right.	Kulungile.
He never came to me.	Akazange eze kum.
You are telling the truth.	Uthetha inyani.
I want to make you go far.	Ndifuna ukwenza ukuba uye kude.
But about anything now.	Kodwa malunga nantoni na ngoku.
It's just strange.	Yinto nje engaqhelekanga.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
It will stay in our place.	Iza kuhlala kwindawo yethu.
No, no case.	Hayi, hayi ityala.
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
Now we know why.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Old car.	Imoto endala.
You can have children.	Unokuba nabantwana.
He opened his eyes slightly.	Wavula amehlo kancinci.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
I have to tell you everything.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele yonke into.
I would really like to see that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukubona oko.
Something is wrong here.	Kukho into engalunganga apha.
Otherwise, we will be with you there.	Ngaphandle koko, siya kuba nawe khona.
He apologized and never tried again.	Wacela uxolo kwaye angaphindi azame.
I feel strong about it.	Ndiziva ngamandla ngayo.
You're sure you don't want to.	Uqinisekile ukuba awufuni .
My mother never told me that.	Umama akazange andixelele loo nto.
There is a party.	Kukho itheko.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Okanye mhlawumbi wonke umntu akayazi loo nto.
What's happening.	Kwenzeka ntoni.
Everyone knows everything.	Wonke umntu uyazi yonke into.
And of course, of course.	Kwaye kunjalo, kunjalo.
If you went out.	Ukuba waphuma.
So, what are we going to do about it?	Ngoko, siza kwenza ntoni ngayo?
That's me.	Ndim lowo.
You feel good.	Uziva ulungile.
But something happened to me.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
We will tell the truth.	Siza kuthetha inyani.
You look great.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu.
Everyone wants to get better.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukwenza ngcono.
Now he does.	Ngoku uyenza.
I know better now.	Ndiyazi ngcono ngoku.
He made everything difficult.	Wenza yonke into nzima.
He says no.	Uthi hayi.
He is definitely going to jail.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya entolongweni.
I can't believe it at all.	Andikholelwa tu.
I don't know where they went.	Andazi ukuba baye phi.
Look, it's just hard.	Jonga, kunzima nje.
However, thank you for your time.	Nangona kunjalo, enkosi ngexesha lakho.
Time to do it now.	Ixesha lokwenza ngoku.
Or somewhere.	Okanye kwindawo ethile.
No one ever said otherwise.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngenye indlela.
He left at night.	Wahamba ebusuku.
They did not go anywhere.	Abazange baye ndawo.
He looks bad.	Ukhangeleka kakubi.
I have to go now.	Kufuneka ndihambe ngoku.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona.
Something very unusual was about to happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo.
However.	Nokuba kunjalo.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
It would be great.	Bekuya kuba kuhle.
I doubt that will happen.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
And it really is.	Kwaye ngokwenene kunjalo.
He knows nothing about anything.	Akazi nto ngayo nantoni na.
So this is something new.	Ngoko le yinto entsha.
She goes to lunch.	Uya kwisidlo sasemini.
Someone who does work.	Umntu owenza umsebenzi.
But doing so quickly is not easy.	Kodwa ukwenza ngokukhawuleza akukho lula.
That goes further.	Oko kuya phambili.
No one tried to speak to him.	Akukho mntu wazama ukuthetha naye.
I go to school.	Ndiya esikolweni.
I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kanye.
But first.	Kodwa kuqala.
He immediately looked up.	Kwangoko wajonga phezulu.
Your image.	Umfanekiso wakho.
I just can't.	Andikwazi nje.
Just another many problems.	Enye nje ingxaki ezininzi.
He told me that himself.	Undixelele lonto ngokwakhe.
He said yes.	Uye wathi ewe.
For a long time then.	Ixesha elide ngoko.
And he wasn't very nice next to her.	Kwaye wayengekho mnandi kakhulu ecaleni kwakhe.
But there is no way to be real.	Kodwa akukho ndlela yokuba yinyani.
My mother.	Umama wam.
You should know that by now.	Ufanele ukwazi oko ngoku.
Then, he came out.	Emva koko, waphuma.
But almost exclusively.	Kodwa phantse kuphela.
Again, thank you.	Kwakhona, enkosi.
Whatever comes to you, fine.	Nokuba yintoni eza kuwe, kulungile.
Not a party.	Hayi itheko.
It was visible again.	Kwakubonakala kwakhona.
I had to sit there waiting.	Kwafuneka ndihlale apho ndilinde.
You have come now.	Uze ngoku.
Far from here.	Kude apha.
I can't tell you right now.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela okwangoku.
All his life.	Ubomi bakhe bonke.
No one knew what he was doing there alone.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba wenza ntoni apho yedwa.
He is too tall.	Mde kakhulu.
I hope that tomorrow my dad will come back even more.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ngomso uza kubuya ngakumbi utata wam.
He will surely return.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kubuya.
But it happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka.
He just wants to talk.	Ufuna nje ukuthetha.
I want to take my wife with me.	Ndifuna ukuthatha umfazi wam ahambe nam.
He didn't know he could do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
I need to know how to do it.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba wenze njani.
However, it is not possible.	Nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka.
He decided to say that.	Wagqiba kwelokuba athethe oko.
Working on it today.	Ukusebenza kuyo namhlanje.
Something bad is going to happen.	Kuya kwenzeka into embi.
An error occurred.	Kwenzeke impazamo.
So thank you very much.	Ngoko enkosi kakhulu.
He is himself.	Nguye ngokwakhe.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I want time alone with you.	Ndifuna ixesha ndedwa nawe.
You will be a friend for a long time to come.	Uya kuba ngumhlobo ixesha elide elizayo.
He left his house immediately after breakfast.	Waphuma endlwini yakhe kwangoko emva kwesidlo sakusasa.
Maybe we'll stay here for a few days.	Mhlawumbi siza kuhlala apha iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I do not have a number.	Andinayo inombolo.
I know that for me.	Ndiyayazi lonto kum.
The question is whether this is so.	Umbuzo kukuba ngaba kunjalo ngokwenene.
At that time the woman was not with him.	Ngelo xesha umfazi wayengekho kunye naye.
I can't do much.	Andikwazi ukwenza okuninzi.
I do not understand how.	Andiqondi ukuba njani.
Into.	Into.
I tried to do something like that.	Ndazama ukwenza into enje.
That's the number that came to me.	Nantso inombolo eza kum.
And it looks like he did.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi uyenzile.
Want some?	Ufuna ezinye?
He thought he had done it.	Wayecinga ukuba uyenzile.
I'm sure of a little something.	Ndiqinisekile ngento encinci.
But that's all right.	Kodwa yonke loo nto ilungile.
It's hard to say that.	Kunzima ukuyithetha loo nto.
He must have said a little something to her.	Inokuba wathetha into encinci kuye.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
Maybe something is wrong.	Mhlawumbi into engalunganga.
I read a little, but not much.	Ndifunde kancinci, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
That never happened that way.	Loo nto ayizange yenzeke ngolo hlobo.
Thank you, thank you.	Enkosi, enkosi.
In a good way.	Ngendlela elungileyo.
He really is.	Nguye ngenene.
I was thinking about it.	Bendicinga ngayo.
Only in the room.	Egumbini kuphela.
He certainly would not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengayi.
I'll know how.	Ndiza kukwazi ukuba njani.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
It will be very good.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
Another great thing to do.	Enye into enkulu yokwenza.
You do not want music.	Awufuni umculo.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala apha.
I do not know the answer.	Andazi impendulo.
I don't know much about it.	Andazi kakhulu ngayo.
I know you're scared.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyoyika.
There was no need.	Kwakungekho mfuneko.
We will definitely come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kuza.
I told him about you.	Ndamxelela ngawe.
We have to go!	Kufuneka sihambe!
That's another thing.	Nantso enye into.
But more so today.	Kodwa ngakumbi namhlanje.
He wants you to come home.	Ufuna ukuba uze ekhaya.
He told me what he wanted.	Undixelele ukuba ufuna ntoni.
We did not do that.	Asizange senze njalo.
Nobody likes to think about it.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukucinga ngayo.
There was nothing in it.	Kwakungekho nto kuyo.
He stayed in bed for two weeks.	Wahlala iiveki ezimbini ebhedini.
Maybe you went too fast.	Mhlawumbi uhambe ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I never heard of him, of course.	Andizange ndive ngaye, kunjalo.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
To me, of course.	Kum, kunjalo.
I want to drive my car.	Ndifuna ukuqhuba imoto yam.
I have gone too far.	Ndihambe kakhulu.
That is his job.	Ngumsebenzi wakhe lowo.
It happened only once.	Yenzeke kanye kuphela.
Sorry for being late.	Uxolo ngokuba late.
Thank you very much!!.	Enkosi kakhulu!!.
He looked inside.	Wajonga ngaphakathi.
He did a few things, but not so much.	Wenza izinto ezimbalwa, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He is just like everyone else.	Ufana naye wonke umntu.
It comes to you.	Iza kuwe.
He wanted to do it.	Wayefuna ukuyenza.
No, it is not.	Hayi, akuyomfuneko.
He knew, not me.	Wayesazi, hayi mna.
I feel bad.	Ndiziva kakubi.
But he had to make a decision.	Kodwa kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
Or almost everyone.	Okanye phantse wonke umntu.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
And he fled from there.	Wabaleka ke kuloo ndawo.
He told me about her.	Wandixelela ngaye.
I know how you know.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi njani.
Now it will be difficult.	Ngoku kuya kuba nzima.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Uthetha ukuba kufuneka wazi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba uthi, hayi.
Why it should be.	Kutheni kufuneka kube njalo.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
Yes, that would be much better.	Ewe, oko kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu.
Not his way.	Hayi indlela yakhe.
He got a call and went out.	Uye wafumana umnxeba waphuma.
I will not repeat my questions.	Andiyi kuphinda imibuzo yam.
Clearly, you love him.	Kucacile ukuba uyamthanda.
But you have it.	Kodwa unayo.
Probably not, though.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
It's just a job.	Ngumsebenzi nje.
But this is difficult.	Kodwa oku kunzima.
I thought it might be him.	Ndandicinga ukuba usenokuba nguye.
All of this is very good.	Konke oku kuhle kakhulu.
Your only job.	Umsebenzi wakho kuphela.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
What you know for sure.	Oko uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
There was no need for that.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba.
He became angry when he arrived late.	Waba nomsindo xa efika emva kwexesha.
So, I don't know what to do.	Ngoko, andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza njalo.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Of course it is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo.
Don't drive too fast!	Musa ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza!
We went well today.	Sihambe kakuhle namhlanje.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngayo.
Too much.	Ukuba kakhulu.
He looked at the others.	Wajonga abanye.
But that is not the case here.	Kodwa akunjalo apha.
He is good to us because he wants to.	Ulungile kuthi kuba efuna.
It seems necessary.	Kubonakala ngathi kufuneka.
Not at this time.	Hayi ngeli xesha.
Trying to think.	Ukuzama ukucinga.
I'm glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba lapha.
He kept talking and talking.	Wahlala ethetha ethetha.
But not his eyes.	Kodwa hayi amehlo akhe.
He will do that.	Uya kuyenza loo nto.
You have to wait.	Kufuneka ulinde.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
You have to make a decision today.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo namhlanje.
Everything is very good.	Konke kuhle kakhulu.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Today, you are the only one.	Namhlanje, nguwe kuphela.
I did so.	Ndenze njalo.
Coming out like that.	Ukuphuma ngolo hlobo.
That means a lot.	Oko kuthetha kakhulu.
There was no question, of course.	Kwakungekho mbuzo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I know very well.	Ndiyazi kakhulu.
But there was no way.	Kodwa kwakungekho ndlela.
Not that you are serious about your job.	Hayi ukuba uzimisele ngomsebenzi wakho.
I really wanted to do it.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza ngokwenene.
He ate his food.	Watya ukutya kwakhe.
He said they would.	Wathi baya kwenza njalo.
No, you have to go.	Hayi, kufuneka uhambe.
What do you want?	Ufuna ntoni?
What time is it, he asked.	Ngubani ixesha, wabuza.
He opened the window.	Wavula ifestile.
Flowers said nothing.	Iintyatyambo akazange athethe nto.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
In everything.	Kuyo yonke into.
His first son.	Unyana wakhe wokuqala.
I love it, but my parents didn’t.	Ndiyayithanda, kodwa abazali bam abazange.
He said that no one was at home.	Wathi akukho mntu ekhaya.
And you have had him.	Kwaye ukhe waba naye.
He hadn’t thought of anything else for years.	Akazange acinge enye into iminyaka.
To do that, you need to know who that is.	Ukwenza oko, kufuneka wazi ukuba ngubani lowo.
And it all happened so fast.	Kwaye konke kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
So, don't do this.	Ngoko, musa ukwenza oku.
It should be very fun.	Kumele kube mnandi kakhulu.
I have only done two so far.	Ndenze ezimbini kuphela okwangoku.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
But look at everything that happened.	Kodwa jonga kuyo yonke into eyenzekileyo.
What are you eating? 	Utya ntoni?
he wanted to know.	wayefuna ukwazi.
This is not the case, however.	Oku akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
And there I am, of course.	Ke kukho mna, kunjalo.
Not so clearly.	Akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
It will be like us.	Kuya kuba ngathi.
Now, you're fine.	Ngoku, ulungile.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
Not just books,	Hayi iincwadi kuphela,
But not this one.	Kodwa hayi le.
But let's be real.	Kodwa makhe sibe yinyani.
Food for one.	Ukutya komnye.
However, it is good to know that you can do it.	Nangona kunjalo, kuhle ukwazi ukuba ungayenza.
How he did it.	Wenze njani .
All but you.	Bonke ngaphandle kwakho.
But she could not stop thinking about it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngayo.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
Thank you very much!.	Enkosi kakhulu!.
He suggested his place.	Wacebisa indawo yakhe.
I belong to him.	Ndim kuye.
He did, you know.	Uyenzile, uyazi.
And that is not easy.	Kwaye akukho lula oko.
Stop thinking about this.	Yeka ukucinga ngale nto.
I am sure you will succeed.	Ndiqinisekile uza kuphumelela.
Or maybe you did something wrong.	Okanye mhlawumbi wenze enye ingxaki.
He looked everywhere but failed.	Wajonga kuyo yonke indawo kodwa akazange aphumelele.
Look at the book and you want to see the work.	Jonga incwadi kwaye ufuna ukubona umsebenzi.
I knew very little.	Ndandisazi kancinci kakhulu.
You know now.	Uyazi ngoku.
And that really means something.	Kwaye oko kuthetha into ngenene.
But I feel so much better.	Kodwa ndiziva ngcono kakhulu.
He does it regularly.	Uyenza rhoqo.
And this will be true.	Kwaye oku kuya kuba yinyani.
He did not arrive on time.	Akazange afike ngexesha.
It will be easier now.	Kuya kuba lula ngoku.
I can't be with you now.	Andikwazi ukuba nawe ngoku.
It could be better for this book.	Kunokuba ngcono kule ncwadi.
He asked for his permission.	Wacela imvume yakhe.
I never had it.	Andizange ndibe nayo.
And he didn't want to go.	Kwaye wayengafuni ukuhamba.
I do not know what this is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni kanye le.
He thought, suddenly.	Wayecinga, ngokukhawuleza.
But it seems right to me.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile kum.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
I mean, like, walking almost.	Ndithetha, ngathi, ukuhamba phantse.
Or tomorrow.	Okanye ngomso.
I'm trying to help you here.	Ndizama ukukunceda apha.
Then he left.	Emva koko wahamba.
I'm not sure which one.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yeyiphi.
Please come with us.	Nceda uhambe nathi.
he wondered.	wazibuza.
Breakfast in bed.	Isidlo sakusasa ebhedini.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange enjenjalo.
That is the answer.	Nantso ke impendulo.
I can do it alone.	Ndingayenza ndedwa.
They will stay this way for a long time.	Baya kuhlala ngale ndlela ixesha elide.
What happened to me? 	Kwenzeka ntoni kum?
he thought.	wacinga.
He has sat back.	Uye wahlala emva.
I don't know much about him.	Andazi kangako ngaye.
Sorry, I can't win.	Uxolo, andikwazi ukuphumelela.
You are eating breakfast.	Utya isidlo sakusasa.
I'm trying to do the same thing.	Ndizama ukwenza into enye.
There is a better way.	Kukho indlela engcono.
Now you feel better.	Ngoku uziva engcono.
He too can speak.	Naye uyakwazi ukuthetha.
I'm so sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu.
Don't go there.	Musa ukuya apho.
He wants a marriage.	Ufuna umtshato .
Good enough, not a big deal.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, hayi into enkulu.
Not as tall as I am.	Hayi mde njengam.
And small.	Kwaye encinci.
He slept longer than he ate.	Walala ixesha elide kunokuba atye.
He was going to be old.	Wayeza kuba mdala.
However, this is not possible.	Kodwa ke, oku akunakwenzeka.
Slowly, he continued.	Kancinci kancinci, waqhubeka.
Not for money.	Hayi ngemali.
Nobody says that.	Akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
He spoke the truth with power.	Wathetha inyaniso ngamandla.
At night,	Ebusuku,
He must have known.	Umele ukuba wayesazi.
But, in the end, he had to go to work.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, kwafuneka aye emsebenzini.
I don't care, really.	Andikhathali, inyani.
Clearly, he did not.	Ngokucacileyo, akazange.
Not about him.	Hayi ngaye.
I never knew what it was.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
Help me.	Ndincede.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
She really loves to travel.	Uthanda ngokwenene ukuhamba.
All that money.	Yonke loo mali.
He said he didn't even know why.	Wathi akayazi nokuba kutheni.
Inside or outside.	Ngaphakathi okanye ngaphandle.
I know more than anyone what work means to you.	Ndiyazi ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na ukuba umsebenzi uthetha ntoni kuwe.
If so and.	Ukuba ngoko kwaye.
Are any of us.	Ngaba nabani na kuthi.
Who will come first?	Ngubani oza kuqala?
Doing the work for you.	Ukwenza umsebenzi kuwe.
Debt relief.	Ukunceda ityala.
Or not.	Okanye akunjalo.
I never did that, well, ever.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto, kakuhle, nanini na.
I saw someone.	Ndabona umntu.
He told me later.	Wandixelela emva kwexesha.
I'm not sure what you did with that fact.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze ntoni ngaloo nyani.
Going to my office, but he did nothing.	Ukuya eofisini yam, kodwa akenzanga nto.
I didn't know how to do this.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndingayenza njani le nto.
Not you.	Hayi wena.
Then he went back.	Emva koko wabuyela emva.
Maybe you will succeed, he thought.	Mhlawumbi uya kuphumelela, wacinga.
This job requires a lot of work.	Lo msebenzi ufuna ukuhamba kakhulu.
But no thank you.	Kodwa hayi enkosi.
Yes, bedtime.	Ewe, ixesha lokulala.
Thank you so much for being there for her.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba lapho ngenxa yakhe.
The woman lives alone.	Umfazi uhlala yedwa.
Only a child.	Ngumntwana kuphela.
But there is a problem with that.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki kuloo nto.
I will try a new method.	Ndiza kuzama indlela entsha.
Look at me.	Ndijonge.
Just do it all over again.	Kuphela ukwenza konke kwakhona.
Image this week.	Umfanekiso kule veki.
Go to your room.	Uye egumbini lakho.
And make money.	Kwaye wenze imali.
That's what happened here.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo apha.
But one more thing.	Kodwa enye into.
You did not know.	Ubungazi.
You probably know.	Usenokuba uyazi.
Thank you	Enkosi
Come to me.	Weza kum.
I told her before.	Ndamxelela ngaphambili.
But it is only a matter of success.	Kodwa kuye kuphela ukuphumelela.
That's the only time.	Lixesha kuphela elo.
This is awesome.	Oku kuhle kakhulu.
Yeah, for now about that.	Ewe, okwangoku malunga nayo.
How wonderful that would be.	Inokuba mnandi kangakanani loo nto.
Then you know.	Emva koko wazi.
He never left the house.	Zange waphuma endlwini.
I've never been here before.	Andizange ndifike apha ngaphambili.
I was just thinking.	Ndandicinga nje.
You seem to feel better.	Ubonakala ngathi uziva ngcono.
You just have to be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe.
Well not.	Kulungile akunjalo.
I wanted to talk more.	Bendifuna ukuthetha ngakumbi.
Not our way.	Hayi indlela yethu.
You cannot, of course, do this.	Awunako, ngokuqinisekileyo, ukwenza oku.
And he did.	Kwaye wenza njalo.
Not for me, though.	Hayi kum, nangona kunjalo.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
I mean, as good as it gets.	Ndiya kuthetha, kakuhle njengoko.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
You know you like it.	Uyazi ukuba uyayithanda.
However, he did not know what was going on.	Nangona kunjalo, wayengazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
You are better than me at it.	Ungcono kunam kuyo.
It's a strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo, wonke umntu uyazi ngayo.
I love that about you.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngawe.
She is just beautiful.	Mhle nje.
I mean the truth.	Ndithetha inyani.
You speak well of me, you speak well of yourself.	Uthetha kakuhle ngam, uthetha kakuhle ngawe.
Really, thank you.	Ngokwenene, enkosi.
That's a good thing.	Nantso into entle.
And for all of us out there.	Kwaye kuthi sonke phaya.
I wanted nothing.	Ndandingafuni kwanto.
I didn't think much of it.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu.
You definitely have to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka uhambe.
I really like it.	Ndiyayithanda ngokwenene.
He wants to do this today.	Ufuna ukwenza oku namhlanje.
Please have someone come.	Ndicela umntu eze.
Finally and here and now.	Ekugqibeleni kwaye apha kwaye ngoku.
Not in a bad way.	Hayi ngendlela embi.
Your father is no exception.	Utata wakho akukho ngaphandle.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
Talking to you.	Ukuthetha nawe.
That will take time.	Oko kuya kuthatha ixesha.
But it was not about him.	Kodwa kwakungekho ngaye.
I want to talk about something else.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngenye into.
And a woman.	Kwaye umfazi .
It's about the same thing.	Kuthetha ngento enye.
And it was not hard to find.	Kwaye kwakungekho nzima ukufumana.
And he won't do it.	Kwaye akayi kuyenza.
This should not have happened.	Oku bekungafanelanga ukuba kwenzeke.
He realized that he had made a serious mistake.	Waqonda ukuba wenze impazamo enkulu.
I can do better than you.	Ndingayenza ngcono kunawe.
You go, something bad happens to you.	Uhamba, kwenzeka into embi kuwe.
It is our job.	Ngumsebenzi wethu.
But this time it did not happen.	Kodwa ngeli xesha akuzange kwenzeke.
Just there.	Apho nje.
Nobody really wants to do that.	Akukho mntu ufuna ngokwenene ukwenza loo nto.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
No and you know why.	Akunjalo kwaye uyazi ukuba kutheni.
In this case, it is.	Kule meko, kunjalo.
He just can't.	Akakwazi nje.
Everyone needs to know this.	Wonke umntu kufuneka akwazi oku.
Ready, absolutely.	Ukulungele, ngokupheleleyo.
He did not really want to be here.	Wayengafuni nyani ukuba lapha.
This is not about you.	Oku akukho malunga nawe.
It has to be hard.	Kufuneka kube nzima.
I will try that way.	Ndiza kuzama loo ndlela.
He wanted you to say the whole word all the time.	Wayefuna ukuba uthethe lonke igama ngalo lonke ixesha.
Not now, of course.	Hayi ngoku, kunjalo.
But there is one problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enye.
I'm afraid to talk to her.	Ndiyoyika ukuthetha naye.
But he was not on time.	Kodwa wayengekho ngexesha.
It has never been done before.	Ayizange yenziwe ngaphambili.
A really good book.	Incwadi entle ngokwenene.
I immediately wanted to stay there.	Ngoko nangoko ndandifuna ukuhlala apho.
My beautiful daughter.	Intombi yam entle.
This person should be right.	Lo mntu ufanele ukuba ulungile.
You learn things as you go.	Ufunda izinto njengoko uhamba.
I really can't get enough of it.	Ngenene andikwazi kufumana ngokwaneleyo.
I made a decision.	Ndenza isigqibo.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Then, he heard a voice.	Emva koko, weva ilizwi.
There was no place for this.	Kwakungekho ndawo kule.
That's it, it's not.	Yiloo nto, akunjalo.
For the rest of your life.	Ubomi bakho bonke.
He's got to be a great man this long time.	Ufanele ukuba yindoda enkulu ngeli xesha elide.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu kakhulu leyo.
I talk to him a lot.	Ndithetha naye kakhulu.
I want that now.	Ndifuna oko ngoku.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi.
Everyone looked ahead.	Wonke umntu wajonga wajonga phambili.
You may be fine, but I will do it.	Unokuba ulungile, kodwa ndiza kuyenza.
I don't know why he didn't.	Andazi ukuba kutheni engazange.
But really.	Kodwa ngokwenene.
That has never happened before.	Loo nto ayizange yenzeke ngoku.
Now soon it will be better.	Ngoku kungekudala kuya kuba ngcono.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
What is so unusual about that ???.	Yintoni engaqhelekanga ngalonto???.
He left the room.	Waphuma egumbini.
We want him to leave.	Sifuna ahambe.
Tell your father.	Xelela utata wakho.
He will do it for both of us.	Uza kuyenza sobabini.
Maybe we will.	Mhlawumbi siya kwenza njalo.
But, that's exactly it.	Kodwa, yiloo nto kanye.
Maybe I'll never see him again.	Mhlawumbi andisayi kuze ndimbone.
He looked away from me.	Wajonga kude kum.
Everyone was talking.	Wonke umntu wayethetha.
You need to talk to him.	Kufuneka uthethe naye.
He did not know who he was.	Wayengazi ukuba ngubani.
He would wait until he knew for sure.	Wayeza kulinda de azi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Maybe we should go.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka sihambe.
My mother loves him.	Umama uyamthanda.
Not just his death.	Hayi nje ukufa kwakhe.
At first he said no but one day he agreed.	Ekuqaleni wathi hayi kodwa ngenye imini wavuma.
He likes to do other things, but not too much.	Uyathanda ukwenza ezinye izinto, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He told me everything.	Wandixelela konke.
I too had hope.	Nam bendinethemba.
You are very lucky.	Unethamsanqa kakhulu.
You have money.	Unayo imali.
He returned to his room.	Wabuyela egumbini lakhe.
And no one really wants that.	Kwaye akukho mntu ufuna ngokwenene oko.
But you are right.	Kodwa ulungile.
Just really hard.	Nje nzima ngokwenene.
It would be better if you did not do so.	Kuya kuba ngcono ukuba awuzange wenze njalo.
He thought about how he felt today.	Wayecinga ukuba uziva njani namhlanje.
He lives in it.	Uhlala kuyo.
He told her the whole truth.	Wamxelela yonke inyaniso.
Don't be late.	Musa ukuba late.
I wanted to do it again.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
He came to his house.	Wafika endlini yakhe.
I had to do it.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze.
He left college and went to work.	Waphuma ekholejini waya emsebenzini.
He hopes to one day become a doctor.	Unethemba lokuba ngenye imini uya kuba ngugqirha.
I didn't go either.	Nam andizange ndiye.
Just in time for you.	Kanye ngexesha wena.
Certainly you should.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufanele ukuba.
I really know that.	Ngokwenene ndiyayazi loo nto.
And I do not know.	Kwaye andazi.
Seeing something wrong.	Ukubona into engalunganga.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
He tried, really.	Wazama, ngokwenene.
How long do you have to travel?	Kufuneka uhambe ixesha elingakanani.
Speaking softly, he came out again.	Ethetha kancinci, waphuma kwakhona.
I heard something strange.	Ndeva into engaqhelekanga.
His wife.	Umfazi wakhe.
But he seems to be sitting still.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi uhleli kancinci.
Of course, you need to know that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kufuneka ukwazi oko.
And you certainly know that.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo uyayazi loo nto.
He did not succeed in getting a job.	Akazange aphumelele ukufumana umsebenzi.
Give me time to be with you.	Ndinike ixesha lokuba ndibe nam.
If you are lucky.	Ukuba unethamsanqa.
I'm not even sure if you like him.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba uyamthanda.
You are reading this book.	Ufunda le ncwadi.
It's hard for him.	Kunzima kuye.
He lives with her here.	Uhlala naye apha.
I want you to talk to me.	Ndifuna uthethe nam.
One is the new one.	Enye yile entsha.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
Tell your friends !.	Xelela abahlobo bakho!.
He hoped he would come.	Wayenethemba lokuba uza kuza.
But he is a person.	Kodwa ungumntu.
I do not know why or when.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okanye nini.
But you do not want to.	Kodwa awufuni.
It would mean my job.	Bekuya kuthetha umsebenzi wam.
I have to be there.	Kufuneka ndibe lapho.
He will have to go in there with her.	Kuya kufuneka angene apho kunye naye.
I'll wait there.	Ndiya kulinda apho.
He does it again.	Uyayenza kwakhona.
This is not entirely necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko ngokupheleleyo.
There is a bit of it in it.	Kukho kancinci kuyo.
Yes, you are right.	Ewe, ulungile kuyo.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
He came out alone.	Waphuma yedwa.
And then the woman.	Kwaye emva koko umfazi.
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
Then they went to his room.	Emva koko baya egumbini lakhe.
He opened the book and began to read.	Wavula incwadi waza waqalisa ukufunda.
All in time.	Konke ngexesha.
I wanted to work with you.	Bendifuna ukusebenza nawe.
And no one heard anything.	Kwaye akukho mntu weva nto.
It could be much better.	Inokuba ngcono kakhulu.
He will not be far off.	Akayi kuba kude.
He did not.	Akazange enze.
You are the only one.	Nguwe wedwa.
I told the truth.	Ndithethe inyani.
He really wanted two.	Wayefuna ezimbini ngokwenene.
Nobody wants anything.	Akukho mntu ufuna nantoni na.
Come.	Uza.
That wasn't him.	Yayingenguye lowo.
I think this will be really fun.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
But it certainly is not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
Or he does not really want to know.	Okanye akafuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
There is everything there.	Kukho yonke into apho.
All right, thank you very much.	Kulungile, enkosi kakhulu.
Thank you.	Enkosi.
I have no better.	Andinayo ngcono.
Or two if you want.	Okanye ezimbini ukuba ufuna.
I had to think of something else.	Kwafuneka ndicinge enye into.
He must have died.	Umele ukuba wafa.
You did really well.	Wenze kakuhle ngenene.
It is impossible for one person to know everything.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba umntu omnye azi yonke into.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
And it happened a long time ago.	Kwaye kwenzeka kudala kakhulu.
Thank you very much.	Enkosi kakhulu.
He ran away with her.	Wabaleka naye.
I did not look back.	Khange ndijonge ngasemva.
Except for one.	Ngaphandle komnye.
I am not at home.	Andikho ekhaya.
If you don't want to, don't.	Ukuba awufuni, musa.
And he still goes to school.	Kwaye nangoku uya esikolweni.
But not as people say.	Kodwa hayi njengoko abantu bathi.
He immediately told the police.	Ngoko nangoko waxelela amapolisa.
I'm very sorry about that.	Uxolo kakhulu ngaloo nto.
Here is what happened.	Into eyenzekayo yile.
It's a strange thing now.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ngoku.
Soon it will be over.	Kungekudala iza kuphela.
Even if the person is me.	Nokuba umntu ndim.
You just want time.	Ufuna nje ixesha.
But this morning.	Kodwa ngale ntsasa.
There is one small window.	Kukho ifestile enye encinci.
I have already done it.	Sele ndiyenza.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
I don't have a girlfriend, of course.	Andinayo intombi, kunjalo.
You do not have to talk about it if you do not want to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe ngayo ukuba awufuni.
And you got to the top.	Kwaye ufike phezulu.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.	Ndicinga ukuthenga imoto entsha.
This is you.	Nguwe lo.
We have to be once at the top.	Sifanele sibe kanye phezulu.
One is that this was not necessary.	Enye kukuba oku kwakungeyomfuneko.
Not that week.	Hayi loo veki.
What the hell?.	Yintoni?.
And in bed.	Kwaye ebhedini.
He did not eat.	Akazange atye.
I can't tell you what's going to happen.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela into eza kwenzeka.
You do not have to do everything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze yonke into.
Long-term completion.	Ukugqiba ixesha elide.
I don't know who that might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba ngubani na lowo.
There is a better way.	Kukho enye indlela engcono.
He will be here.	Uzakuba lapha.
My whole life.	Ubomi bam bonke.
He looked at the books and left.	Wajonga iincwadi wahamba.
Knowing what's going on in my house.	Ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni endlwini yam.
He asked his parents.	Wabuza abazali bakhe.
Two things about this.	Izinto ezimbini ngale nto.
I go to bed.	Ndiya ebhedini.
He did not know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba wenze njani.
I do not care.	Andikhathali.
That's exactly right.	Kunjalo ngokwenene.
Good job.	Umsebenzi omhle.
I think there is really no one.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho mntu ngokwenene.
Done now.	Yenziwe ngoku.
There is a chance that you will succeed.	Kukho ithuba lokuba uya kuphumelela.
But that did not happen to him.	Kodwa oko akuzange kuye.
Everyone knew it, but not me.	Wonke umntu wayesazi, kodwa hayi mna.
I hope you will come soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuza ngokukhawuleza.
I can’t do everything today or this week.	Andikwazi ukwenza yonke into namhlanje okanye kule veki.
Not so much, but a few.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa ezimbalwa.
I will do that.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
Very, very, very tall.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, mde.
We didn't do it.	Asizange siyenze.
Look there.	Jonga phaya.
I know nothing about myself.	Andazi nto ngam.
He made a decision.	Wenza isigqibo.
He has gone too far.	Uhambe kakhulu.
I wanted to be with him.	Ndandifuna ukuba naye.
I will be.	ndiya kuba.
Everyone wants money!	Wonke umntu ufuna imali!
Back when.	Ngasemva xa.
I want up.	Ndifuna phezulu.
Hush hush.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
You will have to do it, however, for all of us.	Kuya kufuneka uyenze, nangona kunjalo, ngenxa yethu sonke.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
Certainly none of us.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho namnye kuthi.
If it happens, it happens.	Ukuba kwenzeka, kwenzeka.
I don't know what the problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
He wanted to go out and do things.	Wayefuna ukuphuma aye kwenza izinto.
You say.	Uthi.
He sat down and pulled out his book.	Wahlala phantsi wakhupha incwadi yakhe.
He opened his eyes.	Wavula amehlo akhe.
At the moment I am not quite sure where the error is.	Okwangoku andiqinisekanga ncam ukuba iphi na impazamo.
He has gone out and walked away.	Uye waphuma wahamba.
So thank you for this.	Ngoko enkosi ngale nto.
He was just not there.	Wayengekho nje apho.
You have to do this.	Kufuneka wenze oku.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
I have never done anything like this.	Zange ndenze into enje.
He has been with me for a very long time.	Uhleli nam ixesha elide kakhulu.
You mean something.	Uthetha into.
That, of course, never happened.	Oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akuzange kwenzeke.
He ran away from home.	Wabaleka wemka ekhaya.
No, he did not know where he was.	Hayi, wayengazi ukuba uphi na.
Thanks for the excellent work !.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi omhle kakhulu!.
I had to see him.	Kwafuneka ndimbone.
But one.	Kodwa enye.
I didn't see why.	Andizange ndibone ukuba kutheni.
He has told me that before.	Undixelele oko ngaphambili.
Today it will be difficult though.	Namhlanje kuya kuba nzima kodwa.
When this always happens.	Xa oku kuhlala kwenzeka.
He was optimistic	Wayenethemba
This is what you want to do.	Yile nto ufuna ukuyenza.
I tried to think back.	Ndazama ukucinga emva.
I'll be back.	Ndiza kubuya.
But he was certainly afraid.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wayesoyika.
It is impossible to know that it is impossible.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
Well, that might just be a thing.	Ewe, inokuba yinto nje leyo.
At first you will do so.	Ekuqaleni uza kwenza njalo.
Man.	Umntu .
No work, no food.	Akukho msebenzi, akukho kutya.
But nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto.
I have never been a child.	Andizange ndibe ngumntwana.
I don’t remember much about him.	Andikhumbuli kangako ngaye.
Yes you are.	Ewe unjalo.
He ate fast.	Watya ngokukhawuleza.
You must not make mistakes.	Akufunekanga wenze iimpazamo.
I just know, that's all.	Ndiyazi nje, yiyo yonke loo nto.
However, there is much more to it.	Kodwa ke, kukho okuninzi ngakumbi kuyo.
Or it could be.	Okanye inokuba.
It is necessary.	Kufuneka.
You did a good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle.
There was no stopping.	Kwakungekho ukuyeka.
This is not a walk in the park.	Oku akukho kuhamba epakini.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nto.
You do what you have to do.	Wenza into ekufuneka uyenzile.
I am fully aware of this.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo le nto.
It's bedtime.	Lixesha lokulala.
It's a person.	Ngumntu.
She was afraid to meet him.	Wayesoyika ukudibana naye.
I don't know why that is.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
I don't really care.	Andikhathali ngokwenene.
You should have talked to him.	Bekufanele uthethe naye.
He did everything.	Wenze yonke into.
Please do more.	Nceda wenze ngakumbi.
And, really, of course.	Kwaye, ngokwenene, kunjalo.
Nobody ever said anything about it.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha nto ngaloo nto.
It would be good for everyone except me.	Kuya kuba kuhle kuye wonke umntu ngaphandle kwam.
Now is the time.	Ngoku lixesha.
I know you know.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi.
But they did not apologize.	Kodwa abazange bathi uxolo.
But every big person has done that.	Kodwa wonke umntu omkhulu uyenzile loo nto.
I don't think that's true.	Andiqondi ukuba yinyani leyo.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha nawe.
I hope you are too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe unjalo.
She thinks back to it.	Ucinga emva kuyo.
And nothing happens.	Kwaye akukho nto eyenzekayo.
There was no one there.	Kwakungekho mntu.
Someone suggested that we leave early.	Omnye umntu wacebisa ukuba sihambe kwangethuba.
Without me, of course.	Ngaphandle kwam, kunjalo.
I do not know at all.	Andazi kwaphela.
I wish you well as you do.	Ndinqwenela ukwenza kakuhle njengawe.
And that's fine.	Kwaye oko kulungile.
His wife took everything.	Umfazi wakhe wathatha yonke into.
I think it will be very difficult.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
I've been here ever since.	Ndilapha ukusukela ngoko.
I want you to know for sure.	Ndifuna uyazi ukuba ngokuqinisekileyo.
So, really everyone.	Ngoko, ngokwenene wonke umntu.
And I would really like to have it.	Kwaye ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuba nayo.
Well look at you now.	Kulungile jonga wena ngoku.
For now.	Okwangoku.
He is doing well.	Uqhuba kakuhle.
Money.	Imali.
So, he has to do it.	Ngoko ke, kufuneka ayenze.
But he went too far.	Kodwa wahamba kakhulu.
This did not happen.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke.
I'm happy then.	Ndiyavuya ngoko.
He told me.	Undixelele.
I am sure it will happen in the end.	Ndiqinisekile, iya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
Maybe you will.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba.
Decide what you want to do and do it.	Ukugqiba ngento ofuna ukuyenza kwaye uyenze.
So not now, thank you.	Ngoko hayi ngoku, enkosi.
We need to be more than that.	Sifanele sibe ngaphezu koko.
Then he left.	Emva koko wemka.
Little by little.	Kancinci, kancinci.
Meeting that morning.	Intlanganiso ngaloo ntsasa.
You play like that.	Udlala ngolo hlobo.
What will happen to us?	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuthi?
And that is a fact.	Kwaye yinyani leyo.
After all, you certainly did succeed.	Emva koko, ngokuqinisekileyo uphumelele.
Long time.	Ixesha elide.
We will be back soon.	Siza kubuya kungekudala.
He thought he would do well.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kuyenza kakuhle.
Everyone wants to play every day.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukudlala yonke imihla.
That's exactly right.	Kunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
He is not there.	Akakho apho.
Not just this.	Hayi nje oku.
But there is something even worse.	Kodwa kukho into embi ngakumbi.
It seems to be the case again.	Kubonakala ukuba kunjalo kwakhona.
And nothing more.	Kwaye akukho nto ngaphezu koko.
It was not difficult.	Kwakungekho nzima.
That was obvious.	Oko kwakucacile.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
Again, that's me.	Kwakhona, ndim lowo.
But did he, he had hope.	Kodwa ngaba, wayenethemba.
you say.	uthi.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
He looked at his daughter.	Wajonga intombi yakhe.
Questions?	Imibuzo?
He just doesn't know anything.	Akazi kwanto nje.
I can succeed.	Ndiyakwazi ukuphumelela.
But little, little.	Kodwa kancinci, kancinci.
She tried but could not speak.	Wazama kodwa akakwazi ukuthetha.
No I do not have.	Hayi andinayo.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko, kulungile.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
And go.	Kwaye uhambe.
Or you do not want them to.	Okanye awufuni ukuba enjenjalo.
She was scared, so she stayed home.	Wayesoyika, ngoko wahlala ekhaya.
Otherwise it is fine.	Ngaphandle koko kulungile.
That obviously is not the case here.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
It’s weird, isn’t it? 	Yinto engaqhelekanga, akunjalo?
He was not there.	Wayengekho apho.
But thank you.	Kodwa enkosi.
Well, that's exactly what happened.	Ewe, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
But the woman says she should go.	Kodwa umfazi uthi kufuneka ahambe.
I wanted to work a little harder.	Ndandifuna ukusebenza kancinci.
There is no time.	Akukho xesha.
Sorry for the inconvenience, you know.	Uxolo ngayo yonke le nto, uyazi.
Getting out of bed tomorrow will be a chore.	Ukuphuma ebhedini ngomso kuya kuba ngumsebenzi.
He did not want to give up.	Wayengafuni ukuyeka.
So are you.	Nawe unjalo.
Even if you say okay.	Nokuba uthe kulungile.
He felt that something terrible was about to happen.	Waziva ukuba kuza kwenzeka into embi.
That's what everyone would talk about later.	Yiloo nto wonke umntu wayeza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
I like the whole thing, too.	Ndiyayithanda yonke loo nto, nam.
He has it all the way.	Unayo yonke indlela.
If you do, that will be the case.	Ukuba wenza oko, oko kuya kuba njalo.
I didn't know that.	Bendingayazi lonto.
And you may be doing that.	Kwaye usenokuba uyayenza loo nto.
I am making breakfast.	Ndenza isidlo sakusasa.
He knows where we are going.	Uyazi apho siya khona.
I thought about it for a long time.	Ndacinga ngayo ixesha elide.
Stop playing!	Yeka ukudlala!
See how long you stay.	Jonga ukuba uhlala ixesha elingakanani.
I know you have it.	Ndiyamazi ukuba unayo.
I hope you can do it this way again.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyakwazi ukuyenza ngale ndlela kwakhona.
Which he probably can't do with me.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi akakwazi ukuyenza nam.
And she loves it and everything.	Kwaye uyayithanda kwaye yonke into.
And there is a cat.	Kwaye kukho ikati.
And it's good that you're good.	Kwaye kuhle ukuba ulungile.
Maybe you want to stay.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuhlala.
One book at a time.	Incwadi enye ngexesha.
You are more sure about it.	Uqinisekile ngakumbi ngayo.
There is no way about it.	Akukho ndlela malunga nayo.
That one.	Omnye lowo.
I wanted to be it.	Ndandifuna ukuba yiyo.
So he likes to sing.	Ngoko uthanda ukucula.
I'll take this one.	Ndiza kuthatha le.
You need to know.	Kufuneka wazi.
Look at him.	Ujonge kuye.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
Well, one person.	Kulungile, umntu omnye.
He was never late.	Akazange abe late.
You are right in your own way.	Ulungile ngendlela yakho.
Let me think about this more.	Makhe ndicinge ngoku ngakumbi.
There was nobody there.	Kwakungekho mntu apho.
That, and because he asked me.	Oko, kwaye ngenxa yokuba wandibuza.
Then he came in.	Emva koko wangena.
Great.	Enkulu.
Look what he did.	Jonga into ayenzileyo.
Maybe a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kancinci.
I could not sit still.	Khange ndikwazi ukuhlala.
Anyone, really.	Nabani na, ngokwenene.
And he wanted to.	Kwaye wayefuna.
I have to do what they tell me to do.	Kufuneka ndenze le nto bathi mandiyenze.
I can't wait for you.	Andikwazi kulinda nawe.
Or to do something else.	Okanye ukwenza enye into.
He was invisible.	Wayengabonakali.
I can't think of anything else.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngenye into.
Nobody lives here right now.	Akukho mntu uhlala apha ngoku.
And he knew where he lived, too.	Kwaye wayesazi apho ahlala khona, naye.
Everyone wants money.	Wonke umntu ufuna imali.
Sorry is a job.	Uxolo ngumsebenzi.
Not my place.	Hayi indawo yam.
Talk to you soon.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo loo nto.
No, not only that.	Hayi, akunjalo kuphela.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
Soon, it will be.	Kungekudala, kuya kuba njalo.
Not a place.	Hayi indawo.
I will eat her children.	Ndiza kutya abantwana bakhe.
You need to know.	Kufuneka ukwazi.
Of course, this is true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oku kunjalo.
He thinks of everything completely.	Ucinga ngayo yonke into ngokupheleleyo.
But for him, it was nothing.	Kodwa kuye, kwakungekho nto.
I don't know what.	Andazi yintoni.
He realized he was wasting his time.	Waqonda ukuba udlala ngexesha lakhe.
However, it is probably better that way.	Nangona kunjalo, mhlawumbi ngcono ngaloo ndlela.
We will never know that.	Soze siyazi loo nto.
That's exactly what this is all about.	Yiyo yonke le nto ngokwenene.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ayizange yenzeke into enje ngaphambili.
Then in everything.	Emva koko kukho konke.
But this is so.	Kodwa oku kunjalo.
I don't know what I'm doing.	Andazi ukuba ndenza ntoni na.
Everyone was scared.	Wonke umntu wayesoyika.
Take her to the bedroom.	Ukuya naye egumbini lokulala.
Maybe he lived alone.	Mhlawumbi wayehlala yedwa.
And so are you, by the way.	Kwaye kunjalo nawe, ngendlela.
Because he is.	Kuba unjalo.
Her mother did not want me to.	Umama wakhe wayengafuni ndiyenze.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi kum.
Opportunity.	Ithuba.
You never stayed in it.	Zange uhlale kuyo.
Not for years if that is the case.	Hayi iminyaka ukuba kunjalo.
He is coming with us.	Uza nathi.
He walked forward into the room.	Wangena phambili egumbini.
And something very unusual happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
I'll wait.	Ndiza kulinda.
Such an unusual place.	Indawo engaqhelekanga enjalo.
And that's it.	Kwaye loo nto.
Maybe more.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi.
You look like that.	Ujonge ngolo hlobo.
He left for work.	Wemka waya emsebenzini.
His voice again.	Ilizwi lakhe kwakhona.
I'm sure he did.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyenzile.
I did not know where he was.	Ndandingazi ukuba uphi na.
I don't like it here, you know.	Andiyithandi apha, uyazi.
I don't know much about him.	Andazi kakhulu ngaye.
Great is fine.	Enkulu ilungile.
I'm really sure.	Ndiqinisekile ngenene.
Or any other.	Okanye nayiphi na enye.
Yes it is.	Ewe yiyo.
Mistake, just a little.	Impazamo, encinci nje.
Nothing to him yet.	Akukho nto kuye okwangoku.
I was not really thinking at the time.	Ndandingacingi ncam ngelo xesha.
I do not have a car.	Andinayo imoto.
Going with him for a long time.	Ukuhamba naye ixesha elide.
But he is tired.	Kodwa udiniwe nguye.
Then we will see where we are going.	Emva koko siza kubona apho siya khona.
Dad is out.	Uye waphuma utata.
Not the way.	Hayi indlela.
Her father is a doctor.	Utata wakhe ngugqirha.
I arrived late.	Ndifike late.
I wanted to do it.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
It seems like hours.	Kubonakala ngathi iiyure.
And you only want one.	Kwaye ufuna enye kuphela.
Strange thing to say, right?	Into engaqhelekanga ukuyithetha, akunjalo?
I thought we had a good morning.	Bendicinga ukuba sihambe kakuhle ekuseni.
I absolutely love it.	Ndiyayithanda ngokupheleleyo.
What is the main problem? 	Yintoni ingxaki enkulu?
There was nothing inside.	Kwakungekho nto ngaphakathi.
There are eyes everywhere.	Kukho amehlo kuyo yonke indawo.
I just heard.	Ndive nje.
That's a lot of time.	Ixesha elininzi elo.
Meet me here.	Ukudibana nam apha.
I mean a lot not so much.	Ndithetha ezininzi hayi kakhulu.
But I want to find another way.	Kodwa ndifuna ukufumana enye indlela.
You will receive his message tomorrow.	Uza kufumana umyalezo wakhe kusasa.
You can't talk.	Awukwazi ukuthetha.
You will be fine.	Uya kuba ulungile.
Not this way.	Hayi ngale ndlela.
I wanted to be human.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngumntu.
Everything is clear here.	Konke kucacile apha.
No one is too tall.	Akakho mde kakhulu.
He never stopped thinking about it.	Akazange ayeke ukucinga ngayo.
One in the back.	Omnye ngasemva.
No problem here.	Akukho ngxaki apha.
You will end.	Uya kuphela.
Then it becomes even more difficult.	Emva koko kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He asked that morning.	Wabuza ngaloo ntsasa.
I like it.	Ndiyayithanda.
So, then, then	Ngoko ke, ngoko, ngoko
I know this place better than you do.	Ndiyazi le ndawo ngcono kunawe.
He has to go now.	Kufuneka ahambe ngoku.
I didn’t see anyone there, though.	Andizange ndibone mntu phaya, nangona kunjalo.
You will want to be there.	Uya kufuna ukuba lapho.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
And then he would like to get a chance.	Kwaye ke angathanda ukufumana ithuba.
Some people, not so much.	Abanye abantu, hayi kakhulu.
And it's hard to say.	Kwaye kunzima ukuthetha.
He did not want to do anything.	Wayengafuni kwenza nto.
I wanted to talk.	Bendifuna ukuthetha.
He tried to find his place there.	Wazama ukufumana indawo yakhe apho.
And he will not go.	Kwaye akayi.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
If not, perhaps it would be best to walk away.	Ukuba akunjalo, mhlawumbi kungcono ukuba uhambe.
I tried to talk to her.	Ndazama ukuthetha naye.
If necessary.	Ukuba kufuneka.
Your word is you.	Ilizwi lakho nguwe.
It seemed right to him.	Kwakubonakala kulungile kuye.
I don't know how he did it.	Andazi ukuba wenze njani.
Please, please, please.	Nceda, nceda, nceda.
Good to try, but no.	Kuhle ukuzama, kodwa hayi.
We will see.	Siza kubona.
But it did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kube njalo.
Don't be hard on me.	Musa ukuba nzima kum.
I do this.	Ndenza oku.
But they will come.	Kodwa baya kuza.
No one knew anything.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto.
Someone had to speak.	Kwafuneka umntu athethe.
I mean, not really.	Ndiya kuthetha, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Then again.	Emva koko kwakhona.
He got into his car.	Wangena emotweni yakhe.
That's right, you know.	Yinyani, uyazi.
Why you ?.	Kutheni wena?.
You must think about it.	Umele ukuba ucinge ngayo.
Too long, too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, elide kakhulu.
And there seems to be only one way to do it.	Kwaye kubonakala kuphela indlela enye yokwenza oko.
He thought such a thing could happen.	Wayecinga ukuba kuza kwenzeka into enjalo.
I thought it was really good.	Ndandicinga ukuba ilungile ngokwenene.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala.
And then we just know.	Kwaye ke siyazi nje.
I'm doing well.	Ndenza kakuhle.
He entered the room.	Wangena egumbini.
No one had to speak.	Akukho mntu kwafuneka athethe.
I always do that.	Ndihlala ndiyenza loo nto.
Yes, very much so.	Ewe, kakhulu.
He really came to us for help.	Ngenene weza kuthi efuna uncedo.
I want an answer.	Ndifuna impendulo.
I'm just trying to win.	Ndizama nje ukuphumelela.
But, but, but.	Kodwa, kodwa, kodwa.
That is exactly what happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto kanye.
Without you, of course.	Ngaphandle kwakho, kunjalo.
You will succeed in the end.	Uya kuphumelela ekugqibeleni.
It's just here and nothing has happened.	Kuthi nje apha kwaye akukho nto yenzekileyo.
But last night he left us.	Kodwa phezolo uye waphuma kuthi.
So, it was not difficult at all.	Ngoko, akuzange kube nzima konke konke.
After all, he was not thinking clearly.	Emva koko, wayengacingi ngokucacileyo.
If possible.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I can't go there now.	Andikwazi ukuya khona ngoku.
It will be much better.	Kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu.
I would like to talk to you.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo ngokwenene.
Don't talk too much.	Musa ukuthetha kakhulu.
That's why it's good.	Yiyo loo nto ilungile.
This is just one thing.	Yinto enye nje le.
Great job.	Umsebenzi omkhulu.
Obviously, it is not.	Ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
It's a big job.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
I had no idea what he was talking about.	Bendingayazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
Don't buy too much.	Musa ukuthenga kakhulu.
Neither do you.	Nawe awunako.
Do not speak ill of him.	Musa ukuthetha kakubi ngaye.
to this day.	kude kube namhlanje.
It will happen.	Iza kwenzeka.
It better be that way.	Kungcono kube njalo.
You should know.	Ufanele ukwazi.
Now you have my attention.	Ngoku unayo ingqalelo yam.
Do you have that.	Ngaba unayo loo nto.
I want my children.	Ndifuna abantwana bam.
I want to know everything.	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into.
When he arrived, the police were already there.	Ukufika kwakhe sele kukho amapolisa.
It's hard for me to drive.	Kunzima kum ukuqhuba.
No, no children.	Hayi, hayi abantwana.
I could not sit still.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala.
So that's a good thing.	Ngoko into elungileyo.
The restaurant is fine.	Indawo yokutyela ilungile.
He told me that no one was interested.	Wandixelela ukuba akukho namnye unomdla.
We need to move forward.	Kufuneka siye phambili.
Look at the music.	Jonga umculo.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
There is one mistake in it though.	Kukho impazamo enye kuyo nangona kunjalo.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
I start tomorrow night.	Ndiyaqala ngomso ebusuku.
We know what a person looks like.	Siyazi ukuba umntu ukhangeleka njani.
But he also did not know why.	Kodwa naye akazange azi ukuba kutheni.
We did well.	Senze kakuhle.
Everyone is watching everyone.	Wonke umntu ujonge wonke umntu.
I can't help it.	Andikwazi ukuzibamba.
I do not understand immediately.	Andiqondi ngoko nangoko.
He looked around.	Wajonga indawo.
I can not wait !!.	Andikwazi kulinda !!.
The best way.	Indlela engcono kakhulu.
It's everywhere, everywhere.	Kukho kuyo yonke indawo, kuyo yonke indawo.
There you have it.	Nantso ke unayo.
There was no problem.	Kwakungekho ngxaki.
Nobody should do that.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba enze loo nto.
And it's very good.	Kwaye kuhle kakhulu.
Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
There is no way he could like it.	Akukho ndlela angathanda ngayo.
But enough to.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukuba.
I'm glad, for you, that you have it.	Ndiyavuya, ngenxa yakho, ukuba unayo.
I've never seen him here before.	Andizange ndimbone apha ngaphambili.
He will stay with me.	Uza kuhlala nam.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
I live here now.	Ndihlala apha ngoku.
Well, here you have it.	Ke ewe, nantso unayo.
Eventually you will succeed.	Ekugqibeleni uya kuphumelela.
It is not far from us.	Akukho kude kuthi.
Look inside.	Jonga ngaphakathi.
More than that really enough.	Ngaphezu koko ngokwaneleyo ngokwenene.
Well then, though you want to.	Kulungile ke, nangona ufuna.
One went with both of them.	Omnye uhambe bobabini.
I can't talk too much about it here yet.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu ngayo apha okwangoku.
He certainly did not go alone.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange ahambe yedwa.
We are going to have dinner.	Siza kutya isidlo sangokuhlwa.
No one talked about it.	Akukho mntu wathetha ngayo.
I'm not sure how that will happen.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuya kwenzeka njani oko.
What it looks like.	Yintoni ebonakala ngathi.
He spends a lot of time away.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi engekho.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
Everyone started talking.	Wonke umntu waqalisa ukuthetha.
I did not know why or how.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni okanye njani.
Well, not at first, of course.	Ewe, hayi ekuqaleni, kunjalo.
But that will be much easier.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Yes, it is impossible.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka.
And my mother.	Kwaye umama wam.
Tell your friends.	Xelela abahlobo bakho.
The answer will come.	Impendulo iya kuza.
If possible, you know, people will do it.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka, uyazi, abantu baya kuyenza.
I think you knew.	Ndicinga ukuba ubusazi.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
He wondered with her.	Wazibuza naye.
I would like to read a book.	Ndingathanda ukufunda incwadi.
Whatever is wrong, we will talk about it.	Nokuba yintoni engalunganga, siza kuthetha ngayo.
I mean.	Ndithetha ukuba.
He went with me.	Uye wahamba nam.
He arrived just in time.	Wafika kwangethuba.
I wanted nothing.	Ndandingafuni nto.
It will always be there.	Kuya kuhlala kukho.
Did you try to find out.	Ngaba wazama ukufumana.
He has been gone for a long time.	Uhambe ixesha elide.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
But very quickly.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I did it.	Ndiyenzile.
That's the exception.	Yiloo nto ngaphandle.
I do so.	Ndenza njalo.
Just plain.	Ngokucacileyo nje.
It is difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I actually decided that.	Nyani ndagqiba ukuba.
death.	ukufa.
None of us.	Akukho namnye kuthi.
No, there was no place.	Hayi, kwakungekho ndawo.
I'll have to look after the money.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge imali.
thanks.	enkosi.
I tried really long.	Ndazama ixesha elide ngokwenene.
You just made a mistake.	Wenza nje impazamo.
I would like.	Ndingathanda.
He did nothing else.	Akazange enze enye into.
And all his friends.	Kwaye bonke abahlobo bakhe.
I don't see anyone behind him.	Andiboni mntu emva kwakhe.
And it hurts a lot.	Kwaye buhlungu kakhulu.
Then he sat down.	Emva koko wahlala phantsi.
Once you have it, you have it.	Xa sele unayo, unayo.
Going forward you feel and do.	Ukuya phambili uziva kwaye wenze.
Both.	Bobabini.
One more thing, too.	Enye into, nayo.
And he doesn't like the other one.	Kwaye akayithandi enye.
And we will succeed.	Kwaye siza kuphumelela.
Now she thought about it.	Ngoku wacinga ngayo.
They live here.	Bahlala apha.
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
I wanted to see something, anything, happen.	Ndandifuna ukubona into, nantoni na, eyenzekayo.
I will always look more closely at things.	Ndiza kuhlala ndijonge ngakumbi izinto.
He didn't know what to do with all that.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo yonke loo nto.
I have done more than anyone.	Ndenze ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
He died that way.	Wafa ngaloo ndlela ke.
And it might be right.	Kwaye inokuba ilungile.
And he doesn't really want to be.	Kwaye akafuni ncam ukuba nguye.
Don't talk football.	Musa ukuthetha ibhola.
He fell asleep almost immediately.	Walala phantse ngoko nangoko.
I will definitely be back soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya kungekudala.
Since he is not here, there is no reason for us to be here.	Ekubeni engekho, akukho sizathu sokuba sibe lapha.
He had never done this before.	Akazange ayenze le nto ngaphambili.
He said he had it.	Wathi unayo.
My mother stayed all day.	Umama wayehlala imini yonke.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
I can't do it now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza ngoku.
But it will get better in the end.	Kodwa kuya kuba ngcono ekugqibeleni.
Because yes, that is what happened.	Kuba ewe, oko kwenzeka.
Anyone can do that.	Nabani na angayenza loo nto.
Well, maybe not exactly this way.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo ncam ngolu hlobo.
It is then time, perhaps, to learn some things.	Ixesha ke, mhlawumbi, ukufunda ezinye izinto.
All right now.	Kulungile okwangoku.
Ok then .	Kulungile ke .
But only after that.	Kodwa kuphela emva koko.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi.
I have never seen so many.	Andizange ndibone ezininzi kangaka.
Another.	Enye.
To him, himself.	Kuye, ngokwakhe.
Only permission.	Kuphela imvume.
There is nothing in it.	Akukho nto kuyo.
The better the better.	Kungcono kungcono.
There is nothing in the car.	Akukho nto emotweni.
Now we need to do two things.	Ngoku kufuneka senze izinto ezimbini.
It was not far.	Kwakungekho kude.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
He did not want it to be that way.	Wayengafuni ukuba njalo.
He sat down and slept.	Wahlala phantsi walala.
I wanted to be with you, see why.	Bendifuna ukuba nawe, ndibone ukuba kutheni.
Just like before.	Kanye njengakuqala.
It is clear.	Kucacile.
And he died that way, too.	Kwaye wafa ngolo hlobo, naye.
Say why.	Uthi kutheni.
And there is no reason for him to think that anyone will do it now.	Kwaye akukho sizathu sokuba acinge ukuba nabani na uya kwenza ngoku.
So, look at it.	Ngoko ke, jonga kuyo.
Just one more time.	Kanye nje ixesha elingakumbi.
No need.	Akukho mfuneko.
So there is no question.	Ngoko ke akukho mbuzo.
She wanted her son.	Wayefuna unyana wakhe.
It went well with me.	Uhambe kakuhle nam.
He ate lunch at a restaurant.	Watya isidlo sasemini kwindawo yokutyela.
I'm sure he does.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayenza.
And everyone, really.	Kwaye wonke umntu, ngokwenene.
I just wanted to be myself.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba ndim.
You will be hurt.	Uya kuba buhlungu.
If he ran away.	Ukuba wabaleka .
It should be fun.	Kumele kube mnandi.
That's why you're here alone.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha wedwa.
I like that about him.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngaye.
Nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto.
Well, there you are.	Kulungile, nantso.
But children.	Kodwa abantwana.
He wrote to me.	Wandinika.
I think that will only continue.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kuqhubeka kuphela.
You have decided to look for a new job.	Uye wagqiba ekubeni ufuna umsebenzi omtsha.
Yes, that's a good question.	Ewe, umbuzo olungileyo.
My mother did not agree.	Umama akazange avume.
Nobody seems to want to do that.	Akukho mntu ubonakala efuna ukuyenza loo nto.
I have to think about what happened to me and why.	Kufuneka ndicinge ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum kwaye kutheni.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
And tell him why.	Kwaye umxelele ukuba kutheni.
I think you are there.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhona.
I don't know why this happened.	Andazi ukuba kutheni le nto yenzeke.
Just one more thing.	Enye nje into enye.
But he does not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba enjenjalo.
I never thought.	Andizange ndicinge.
And don't be a child.	Kwaye musa ukuba ngumntwana.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
There something is happening.	Phaya phaya kukho into eyenzekayo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange.
And so will you.	Kwaye nawe uya kuba njalo.
He is very interested in me.	Unomdla omkhulu kum.
So we know what you want.	Siyazi ke ukuba ufuna ntoni na.
But otherwise, nothing.	Kodwa ngenye indlela, akukho nto.
I'm not sure where.	Andiqinisekanga apho.
However, this is not the case here.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo apha.
Sorry not sorry.	Uxolo hayi uxolo.
I'm not sure what this is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni le.
This is not the case, either.	Ayisiyiyo le, nayo.
He was late for work.	Wafika emva kwexesha emsebenzini.
Then, maybe you are.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi ukhona.
That, really, is human.	Oko, ngokwenene, ngumntu.
I have done this far.	Ndenze oku kude.
I think you know that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
It must be so.	Kumele kube njalo.
The doctor agreed.	Ugqirha wavuma.
I want you to come.	Ndifuna uze.
That's why he finally returned home.	Yiyo loo nto ekugqibeleni wabuyela ekhaya.
Only it did not happen.	Kuphela akuzange kwenzeke.
I haven't spoken to him since.	Khange ndithethe naye ukusukela ngoko.
That is probably why nothing happened.	Inokuba yiyo loo nto khange kwenzeke nto.
And yet you want to know.	Kwaye kunjalo ufuna ukwazi.
But look at the car.	Kodwa jonga emotweni.
Something strange.	Into engaqhelekanga.
This has never happened before.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke ngaphambili.
That will do just that.	Oko kuya kwenza kanye.
He opened his door.	Wavula ucango lwakhe.
They stay here a long time.	Bahlala apha ixesha elide.
They will come.	Baza kuza.
I'm not sure this person was saying the wrong thing.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba lo mntu wayethetha into embi ngayo.
In this regard.	Ngale ndlela.
Maybe you do too.	Mhlawumbi nawe wenza njalo.
I still don't care.	Andikhathali nangoku.
Yes, it takes time.	Ewe, kuthatha ixesha.
So everything will be fine.	Ngoko yonke into iya kuhamba kakuhle.
Then you just want to stay home.	Emva koko ufuna nje ukuhlala ekhaya.
I wanted to go to the office.	Bendifuna ukuya eofisini.
It is.	Yinto.
In the city too much perhaps.	Edolophini kakhulu mhlawumbi.
Maybe he really did.	Mhlawumbi wenza ngokwenene.
Maybe that’s okay though.	Mhlawumbi oko kulungile kodwa.
But not so with you.	Kodwa akunjalo kuwe.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
Or in front of him.	Okanye phambi kwakhe.
Learning to read music can be very difficult.	Ukufunda ukufunda umculo kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Yes, it can.	Ewe, kunokuba njalo.
With us.	Kanye nathi.
The question is why this might be so.	Umbuzo kukuba kutheni oku kunokuba njalo.
Yes Yes! 	Ewe, ewe!
So something happened.	Ngoko kukho into eyenzekayo.
I heard nothing from him.	Khange ndive nto kuye.
But it is.	Kodwa kunjalo.
And you .	Kwaye wena .
Everyone needs an answer.	Wonke umntu ufuna impendulo.
He looked at his phone.	Wajonga ifowuni yakhe.
But he did not help us.	Kodwa akazange asincede.
Or, not with him.	Okanye, hayi kunye naye.
I've always said the same thing to myself.	Bendisoloko ndithetha into enye nam.
It’s not fun, and it’s hard.	Akukho mnandi, kwaye kunzima.
Maybe I'll say yes.	Mhlawumbi ndiza kuthi ewe.
And he went.	Wahamba ke.
And that will continue for the rest of my life.	Kwaye oko kuya kuqhubeka ubomi bam bonke.
He may not have been present at the beginning.	Usenokuba wayengekho ekuqaleni.
Everyone should do the same.	Wonke umntu kufuneka enjenjalo.
Then everything was clear.	Emva koko kwakucacile konke.
But that really happened later.	Kodwa oko ngenene kamva.
Please keep an eye out for this.	Nceda uhlale ujonge oku.
But there it is.	Kodwa nantso.
We will talk to her.	Siza kuthetha nayo.
Reads books.	Ufunda iincwadi.
He did a good job here.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle apha.
He is just sleeping.	Ulele nje.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
I'm very sorry about this.	Uxolo kakhulu ngale nto.
And he will do it.	Kwaye uya kuyenza.
Don't stop for now.	Musa ukuyeka okwangoku.
And you know why.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba kutheni.
I will see my son.	Ndiza kubona unyana wam.
We must be.	Kufuneka sibe njalo.
That's a very good thing.	Nantso into entle kakhulu.
I needed help.	Bendifuna uncedo.
Or both.	Okanye bobabini.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni.
Don't go shopping for everything in front of me.	Musa ukuya kuthenga yonke into phambi kwam.
You have spoken too much.	Uthethe kakhulu.
Obviously, that did not happen here.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akuzange kwenzeke apha.
He ate nothing.	Khange atye nto.
I wanted alcohol.	Bendifuna utywala.
They came in.	Wangena.
He says yes.	Uthi kunjalo.
Plenty of coffee, whether you like it or not.	Ikofu eninzi, nokuba uyafuna okanye awufuni.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
I come here to work.	Ndiza apha emsebenzini.
Maybe this is possible.	Mhlawumbi oku kunokwenzeka.
We will be back with you soon.	Siza kubuya nawe kungekudala.
Thus, the name.	Ngaloo ndlela, igama.
He has no chance.	Akanalo ithuba.
Well, not here.	Ewe, akunjalo apha.
I don't know how to do this.	Andazi ukuba mandiyenze njani le nto.
Dog day and night.	Inja imini ebusuku.
No, you should not.	Hayi, akufanele.
He has to eat something.	Kufuneka atye into.
But that will not last.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuhlala.
I think he is.	Ndicinga ukuba unjalo.
You don't look like you have it.	Awubonakali ngathi unayo.
He loves her very much.	Uyamthanda kakhulu.
Yes you are right.	Ewe ulungile.
Not so much, but a little bit.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa kancinci.
I have thought about it for a long time and it is difficult.	Ndiye ndacinga ixesha elide kwaye kunzima ngayo.
But that's it.	Kodwa yiloo nto.
Not so much for me.	Hayi kakhulu kum.
He came and did something.	Ufike wenza into.
You probably do not need to.	Mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko ukwenjenjalo.
Is this.	Ngaba oku.
She looked at her son.	Wajonga unyana wakhe.
We never were.	Asizange sibe njalo.
He came to us for help.	Weza kuthi efuna uncedo.
Just give me a picture.	Ndinike umfanekiso nje.
There they stayed for another week.	Apho bahlala enye iveki.
Not now, just in time.	Hayi ngoku, kwangethuba.
No one really knew what was going on.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Whatever it is, you do it.	Nokuba yintoni na, uyayenza.
I really didn't know.	Ngokwenene ndandingazi.
But a lot of people.	Kodwa abantu abaninzi.
It is good to have friends.	Yinto entle ukuba nabahlobo.
He will not go far.	Akayi kufika kude.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
You will not be in it for so long.	Awuyi kuba kuyo ixesha elide kangako.
I'm sure we will.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba siza kwenza njalo.
Everyone knows who you are talking about.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba uthetha bani.
Because the eyes.	Ngenxa yokuba amehlo.
You can't say anything.	Awukwazi ukuthetha nantoni na.
If you want to succeed, you must make friends.	Ukuba ufuna ukuphumelela, ufuna abahlobo.
This means that.	Oku kuthetha ukuba .
Everyone should try.	Wonke umntu kufuneka azame.
So to speak.	Ngoko ukuthetha.
He had to think about why we were coming to him.	Kwafuneka acinge ukuba kutheni siza kuye.
I will never make the same mistake again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndiyenze impazamo efanayo.
He made you think.	Wakwenza wacinga.
Perhaps you too have not been a friend.	Mhlawumbi nawe awuzange ube ngumhlobo wakho.
I looked down.	Ndijonge phantsi.
You have to do it now.	Kufuneka wenze ngoku.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguwe hayi mna.
But somehow he was just talking.	Kodwa ngenye indlela wayethetha nje.
But my problem is this.	Kodwa ingxaki yam yile.
Look at my cat!	Jonga ikati yam!
The children have to go to school.	Abantwana kufuneka baye esikolweni.
Of course he was not.	Ewe wayengekho.
He came now, very quickly.	Uze ngoku, ngokukhawuleza.
He tried to think of something else.	Wazama ukucinga ngenye into.
And maybe so.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Let me repeat.	Makhe ndiphinde.
You have to do something about it. 	Kufuneka wenze into ngayo. 
But tell me about yourself.	Kodwa ndixelele ngawe.
This will be my job.	Oku kuya kuba ngumsebenzi wam.
We will get better.	Siya kuba ngcono.
All now.	Konke ngoku.
But my mother did not want to.	Kodwa umama wayengafuni.
Then he died.	Emva koko wafa.
It's not so fun.	Akukho mnandi kangako.
That is as clear as it seems.	Oko kucacile njengoko kubonakala.
Quick and sure, here's how to do it.	Ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo, nantso indlela yokwenza.
I could not wait to get there.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukufika apho.
I want this.	Ndifuna lento.
She does all she can to help others.	Wenza konke okusemandleni akhe ukuze ancede abanye.
Something like that.	Into enjalo.
He wants to help you.	Ufuna ukukunceda.
I know you, now.	Ndiyakwazi, ngoku.
I finally got there.	Ndifike apho ekugqibeleni.
If this happens, fine.	Ukuba oku kwenzeka, kulungile.
I'm not sure we even know what that is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba siyazi nokuba yintoni leyo.
I went there.	Ndaya apho.
I just don't remember.	Andikhumbuli nje.
Then he began to study.	Emva koko, waqalisa ukufunda.
I can't today.	Andikwazi namhlanje.
It should be good.	Kumele kube kuhle.
I didn't even know what it was.	Bendingayazi nokuba yintoni.
I was thinking about him.	Bendicinga ngaye.
I wish to go.	Ndinqwenela ukuhamba.
You have been this way for a long time.	Uhlale kule ndlela ixesha elide.
Her mother said she liked it.	Umama wakhe wathi uyayithanda.
The picture, of course.	Umfanekiso, kunjalo.
Is there a doctor in the house?	Ukhona ugqirha endlini?
He will be human again.	Uzakuba ngumntu kwakhona.
Because it is not.	Ngenxa yokuba akunjalo.
Eventually he would tell her.	Ekugqibeleni wayeza kumxelela.
Impossible to operate.	Akunakwenzeka ukusebenza.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngayo enye into.
But, my phone.	Kodwa, ifowuni yam.
I am now.	Ndim ngoku.
You will be in everything.	Uza kuba kuyo yonke into.
And that is what happens here.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka apha.
Right on.	Oku ngoku.
Everything.	Yonke into.
You just do your job.	Wenza nje umsebenzi wakho.
If you are.	Ukuba ukhona.
Looking ahead, I saw nothing.	Ndijonge phambili, ndabona kwanto.
You really want to.	Ufuna ngokwenene.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Good performance now.	Ukusebenza kakuhle ngoku.
But then he looked around the room.	Kodwa emva koko wajonga egumbini.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
Everyone knows it is time for us to leave.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba lixesha lokuba sihambe.
There was not much need.	Kwakungekho mfuneko ingako.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
And then what.	Kwaye emva koko yintoni.
He just looked.	Wajonga nje.
Is my book good?	Incwadi yam ilungile?
And it could be better.	Kwaye kunokuba ngcono.
In the office.	Eofisini.
It's the same thing again.	Yinto enye kwakhona.
He is doing it now.	Uyayenza ngoku.
That seems difficult.	Oko kubonakala kunzima.
You want to be here.	Ufuna ukuba lapha.
And maybe it was nothing.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kwakungekho nto.
They will return.	Baya kubuya.
However, in this case it will not be so.	Nangona kunjalo, kule meko akuyi kuba njalo.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
You know what really happened.	Uyayazi into eyenzekileyo ngokwenene.
He has made many friends during his time.	Uye wafumana abahlobo abaninzi ngexesha lakhe.
I should not have come here.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ndize apha.
It's a job, it's a job.	Ngumsebenzi, ngumsebenzi.
Where are we going?	Apho siya khona?
Lots of meat.	Inyama eninzi.
I speak clearly now.	Ndithetha ngokucacileyo ngoku.
He seems to be very smart.	Kubonakala ngathi ukrelekrele kakhulu.
There is just a voice.	Kukho ilizwi nje.
Even the problem.	Nokuba ingxaki .
That should have been okay.	Oko bekufanele ukuba kulungile.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
That time now.	Elo xesha ngoku.
He watched the other one come.	Wajonga omnye efika.
So it's the same thing.	Ngoko yinto enye.
Everyone is there.	Wonke umntu ukhona.
I know who he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
Certainly his eyes.	Ngokuqinisekileyo amehlo akhe.
I'm doing much better.	Ndenza ngcono kakhulu.
I know you never did.	Ndiyazi ukuba awuzange wenze njalo.
He did this.	Wayenza le nto.
So, he asked me.	Ngoko, wandibuza.
Eventually it will appear.	Ekugqibeleni iya kubonakala.
And like us.	Kwaye ngathi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
You have to stay away from me.	Kufuneka uhlale kude kum.
But he is not going.	Kodwa akayi.
I will stay with you.	Ndiya kuhlala nawe.
My mind, my mind.	Ingqondo yam, ingqondo yam.
He sat down immediately.	Wahlala phantsi ngoko nangoko.
How did the accident happen?	Yenzeke njani le ngozi?
I am here because of you.	Ndilapha ngenxa yakho.
Look at it.	Jonga kuyo.
But now you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi.
Maybe you bought too much.	Mhlawumbi uthenge kakhulu.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
You are wasting your time.	Udlala ngexesha lakho.
What will they do.	Baza kwenza ntoni.
I'm not so sure, though.	Andiqinisekanga kangako, nangona kunjalo.
She opened the door next to him.	Ufike wavula ucango ecaleni kwakhe.
That's another job.	Omnye umsebenzi lowo.
I thought it was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe.
He did not have to be there.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba abe lapho.
I want to see.	Ndifuna ukubona.
I would like to go.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba.
He left with her immediately.	Wemka naye ngokukhawuleza.
No one ever told me.	Akukho mntu wakha wandixelela.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
Finally he suggested.	Ekugqibeleni wacebisa.
But, that's what happened.	Kodwa, nantso into eyenzekayo.
I can’t stop with this book.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ngale ncwadi.
Without me.	Ngaphandle kwam.
And he was wearing a coat.	Kwaye wayenxibe idyasi.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
Then he went into his room.	Emva koko wangena egumbini lakhe.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba uhambe.
So nobody here.	Ngoko akukho mntu apha.
It takes a lot of time.	Kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
I am sure you will do well.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kwenza kakuhle.
I don't know how to deal with this.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
Made up.	Yenziwe.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
Thus, there is.	Ngaloo ndlela, kukho.
I'm happy to talk about anything.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha ngayo nantoni na.
Not so in this book.	Akunjalo kule ncwadi.
Many books.	Iincwadi ezininzi.
We have to do it every morning !.	Kufuneka siyenze njalo kusasa!.
To be.	Ukuba.
They will be back soon.	Baza kubuya nje mva.
To do that once again.	Ukwenza oko kube kanye kwakhona.
Please buy his book.	Nceda uthenge incwadi yakhe.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
But this is not about that.	Kodwa oku akukho malunga naloo nto.
However, this is not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo.
You need to know everything.	Kufuneka wazi yonke into.
Let me tell you what happened.	Makhe ndikuxelele into eyenzekayo.
You know this place very well.	Uyayazi kakuhle le ndawo.
I don't even know what it is.	Andazi nokuba yintoni na.
I do not want your forgiveness.	Andifuni uxolo lwakho.
He knew he had to do something.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka enze into ethile.
Well, just this.	Ewe, kanye oku.
There is something wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga.
I should have stayed with him.	Bekufanele ndihlale naye.
You work when you want to.	Usebenza xa ufuna.
I don't know what to expect.	Andazi ukuba ulindele ntoni.
He ran in front of me.	Wabaleka phambi kwam.
Something is happening here.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha.
It will.	Iya kwenza.
Not so though.	Akunjalo nangona kunjalo.
Right next to me.	Kanye ecaleni kwam.
I think he was very scared.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesoyika kakhulu.
Something has to be done.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe.
And we will do that.	Kwaye siya kuyenza loo nto.
He did not want to stay.	Wayengafuni ukuhlala.
I did not know where he was going.	Bendingazi noba uzimisele ukuya phi.
I decided to go.	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndihambe.
Maybe he was scared, too.	Mhlawumbi wayesoyika, naye.
You will not go with it.	Awuyi kuhamba nayo.
Test, maybe.	Uvavanyo, mhlawumbi.
He did this in an unusual way.	Wakwenza oku ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
But there was not much.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto ingako.
I think so.	Ndikhe ndicinge njalo.
Unless it is.	Ngaphandle kokuba akunjalo.
There was nothing at all to do then.	Kwakungekho nto konke konke yokwenza ngoko.
We should too.	Nathi sifanele.
Soon now.	Kungekudala ngoku.
Otherwise you have done well.	Ngaphandle koko wenze kakuhle.
Two things about that, though.	Izinto ezimbini malunga naloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
This must have happened to you a lot.	Oku kumele ukuba kwenzeke kuwe kakhulu.
He handed it to me and took it from me.	Wandinika wathatha kum.
Or his parents.	Okanye abazali bakhe.
Many, many, more.	Abaninzi, abaninzi, ngakumbi.
That would be great.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
And if not.	Kwaye ukuba akunjalo.
And he knew it was me, too.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba ndim, naye.
Look at this question.	Jonga lo mbuzo.
He wishes he had not.	Unqwenela ukuba akazange.
It must be difficult.	Kumele kube nzima.
I need to know who did this.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba ngubani owenze lento.
Obviously he did not succeed.	Ngokucacileyo akazange aphumelele.
Only everywhere.	Kuphela kuyo yonke indawo.
I just knew.	Ndandisazi nje.
If you do not know.	Ukuba awuyazi.
He looked at his dog.	Wajonga inja yakhe.
It all takes time.	Konke kuthatha ixesha.
By the way.	Kunjalo nje.
I don't even care who wins.	Andikhathali nokuba ngubani oza kuphumelela.
And.	Kwaye.
One thing in another way.	Into enye ngenye indlela.
He knew better.	Wayesazi ngcono.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
He left.	Wahamba.
There are so many things.	Kukho izinto ezininzi.
He did a great job with that.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle ngaloo nto.
I heard a lot.	Ndive kakhulu.
Supposed to be .	Umele ukuba .
He took coffee for a long time.	Wathatha ikofu ixesha elide.
There is no one out here.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle apha.
We want new money.	Sifuna imali entsha.
We will be coming soon for help.	Siza kuza ngokukhawuleza uncedo.
Not just here.	Akunjalo nje apha.
He looks so bad, you know.	Ukhangeleka embi kakhulu, uyazi.
That's the way we do it.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo.
I wanted many things at once.	Ndandifuna izinto ezininzi ngexesha elinye.
I don't really understand why this is so.	Andiqondi kakuhle ukuba kutheni le nto kunjalo.
He is lying in bed.	Ulele ebhedini.
And you too will be here.	Kwaye nawe uzakuba lapha.
You always are.	Uhlala unjalo.
Definitely a dog.	Ngokuqinisekileyo inja.
This is good.	Oku kuhle.
Here it means that the top is better.	Apha kuthetha ukuba phezulu kungcono.
I don't know if it's true or not.	Andazi noba yinyani na okanye hayi.
But you do not want to do this.	Kodwa awufuni ukwenza oku.
He finally did it.	Ekugqibeleni uyenzile.
If you do not want to leave.	Ukuba awufuni ukuhamba.
They live in our area.	Bahlala kwindawo yethu.
But it is definitely okay.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo ilungile.
I don't want to do it.	Andifuni ukuyenza.
He would see.	Wayeza kubona.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba njalo.
Not really.	Hayi ngokwenene.
She loves her father.	Uyamthanda utata wakhe.
I'll do it without you, though.	Ndiza kukwenza ngaphandle kwakho, nangona kunjalo.
It would be that easy.	Bekuya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
I have to go fast.	Kufuneka ndihambe ngokukhawuleza.
So this is a place to stay.	Ngoko le ndawo yokuhlala.
I know he only does his job.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza umsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
They all sit down together.	Bahlala phantsi bonke kunye.
Maybe he knew what was coming.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
You know why.	Uyasazi isizathu.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze.
It seemed to us.	Kwakubonakala ngathi .
I'm sure, just like me.	Ndiqinisekile, njengam.
I have never heard anything so bad before.	Andizange ndive nantoni na embi ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
We know more about that now.	Siyazi ngakumbi ngaloo nto ngoku.
Eventually we will get to it.	Ekugqibeleni siza kufika kuyo.
I didn't go very far.	Andizange ndihambe kakhulu.
Now and then.	Ngoku nangoko.
We will come back as often as we need to do it.	Siza kubuya rhoqo njengoko kufuneka ukuze siyenze.
To tell you.	Ukukuxelela.
He wanted nothing.	Wayengafuni nto.
He says he is a friend.	Uthi ngumhlobo.
He did not do so.	Akenzanga njalo.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokwenene akunjalo.
I have to help.	Kufuneka ndincede.
I thought about that.	Ndacinga ngaloo nto.
He had to say something.	Kwafuneka athethe into.
All in good time.	Konke ngexesha elihle.
He just fell asleep.	Walala nje.
about anything else! 	ngayo nayiphi na enye into!
when there is time.	xa kukho ixesha.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
And.	Kwaye .
Again, her mother.	Kwakhona, umama wakhe.
It wasn't him.	Yayingenguye.
I had never seen him before.	Andizange ndimbone ngaphambili.
Knowing that is a must.	Ukwazi ukuba kufuneka.
If you like.	Ukuba uyathanda.
You know the way.	Uyayazi indlela.
I'm not really sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene.
Let me repeat the question.	Makhe ndiphinde umbuzo.
Let me tell you about it.	Makhe ndikuxelele ngaye .
I asked for help.	Ndacela uncedo.
You obviously feel bad about this.	Kucacile ukuba uziva kakubi ngale nto.
I want to go to him.	Ndifuna ukuya kuye.
You just can't.	Awunako nje.
He was talking fast.	Wayethetha ngokukhawuleza.
I have to be the first.	Kufuneka ndibe ngowokuqala.
I do it perfectly.	Ndiyenza ngokupheleleyo.
So he went to buy.	Wahamba ke waya kuthenga.
He told her everything.	Wamxelela yonke into.
And then for a very good reason.	Kwaye ke ngenxa entle kakhulu.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi na.
He will come to it soon.	Uza kuza kuyo kungekudala.
So very true.	Ngoko yinyani kakhulu.
I had to go to it.	Kwafuneka ndiye kuyo.
You have made a very good picture.	Wenze umfanekiso omhle kakhulu.
He gave me a voice.	Wandinika ilizwi.
Also, the work is often difficult.	Kwakhona, umsebenzi udla ngokuba nzima.
Great mistake.	Impazamo enkulu.
There is truth in this.	Kukho inyaniso kule nto.
You need to know what it is.	Kufuneka uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Only for many years.	Kuphela iminyaka emininzi.
He agreed to have lunch with her.	Wavuma ukutya naye isidlo sasemini.
I want to get out.	Ndifuna ukuphuma.
I don't remember anyone doing a great thing.	Andikhumbuli nabani na esenza into enkulu.
You can and will do it.	Ungayenza kwaye uya kuyenza.
Maybe he was thinking about that.	Mhlawumbi wayecinga ngaloo nto.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
Obviously you like it.	Kucacile ukuba uyayithanda.
They will certainly do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuyenza.
He took a large piece of meat.	Wathatha inyama enkulu.
He looked bad, but not my way.	Wajonga kakubi, kodwa hayi indlela yam.
However, that is not possible.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akunakwenzeka.
But he can't.	Kodwa akakwazi.
I told my mother that there was no truth in it.	Ndamxelela umama ukuba akukho nyani kuyo.
This does not exist, and probably never will.	Oku akukho, kwaye mhlawumbi soze.
I thought it was a good idea.	Bendicinga ukuba licebo elihle.
I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
He wanted to leave, but he could not.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kodwa akazange akwazi.
Maybe this will be good.	Mhlawumbi oku kuya kuba kuhle.
I want to know how you feel about me.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba uziva njani ngam.
More, more to me.	Ngakumbi, ngakumbi kum.
Look there.	Jonga phaya .
But he could not get to her.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuya kuye.
He has to act fast.	Umele enze ngokukhawuleza.
And he did so.	Waza wenza njalo.
You want to talk to me, you don't show up here.	Ufuna ukuthetha nam, awubonakali apha.
I don't want his money.	Andifuni mali yakhe.
I would like the same thing.	Ndingathanda into efanayo.
He picked up the book.	Wathatha incwadi.
I know who this is.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ngubani lo.
You are better everywhere.	Ungcono kuyo yonke indawo.
Thank you for being on time.	Enkosi ngokuba ngexesha.
I did not know the answer.	Bendingayazi impendulo.
And he went his way.	Uye wahamba ke.
There is no meaning.	Akukho kuthetha.
He talked about it.	Wathetha ngayo.
In spite.	Ngaphandle.
I need help.	Ndicela uncedo.
For it is nothing more than that.	Kuba akukho ngaphezu koko.
He went with it.	Wahamba nayo.
No one came to him.	Akukho mntu uze kuye.
And stop trying so hard.	Kwaye yeka ukuzama nzima.
But he would like one.	Kodwa angathanda enye.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
I didn't, I never thought he would.	Andizange, andizange ndicinge ukuba uya kuba njalo.
He did not know exactly why.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba kutheni.
I can't swim.	Andikwazi ukuqubha.
I thought it might be him.	Ndandicinga ukuba inokuba nguye.
Do you look.	Ngaba ujonge.
One has to know one.	Kufuneka umntu azi enye.
I'm pretty sure nothing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho nto.
He has to make a decision.	Kufuneka enze isigqibo.
The question is what to do with it.	Umbuzo kukuba wenze ntoni ngayo.
I wanted to do that.	Bendifuna ndenze njalo.
When he got home he did not stay long.	Ukufika kwakhe ekhaya akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
I hope you have understood.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uye waqonda.
Or no, but you will definitely try.	Okanye hayi, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuzama.
There is no place to stay.	Akukho ndawo yokuhlala.
But it is probably true.	Kodwa mhlawumbi yinyani.
And about that.	Kwaye malunga naloo nto.
I really want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye.
He wanted to wait.	Wayefuna ukulinda.
Suddenly, he thought.	Ngokukhawuleza, wacinga.
He is here with us.	Ulapha kunye nathi.
We'll see more tomorrow about that.	Siza kubona ngakumbi ngomso ngaloo nto.
The way.	Indlela.
No one asked me one question.	Akukho mntu wandibuza umbuzo omnye.
This will be fun.	Oku kuya kuba mnandi.
To do things, little by little.	Ukwenza izinto, kancinci kancinci.
He talked like that, too.	Wathetha ngolo hlobo, naye.
I'm sure someone will get to it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba umntu uya kufika kuyo.
I'll be back then.	Ndiya kubuya ngoko.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngomso, kungekudala.
Everyone knows everyone.	Wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu.
He tries to do this whenever possible.	Uzama ukwenza oku nanini na kunokwenzeka.
But again, that would take time.	Kodwa kwakhona, oko kuya kuthatha ixesha.
And no one did anything about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza nto ngaloo nto.
That really happened.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Finally, he went down.	Ekugqibeleni, wehla.
However, he could not.	Nangona kunjalo, akazange akwazi.
My father did not know.	Utata wayengazi.
But it will be fun.	Kodwa kuya kuba mnandi.
He does it every day.	Wenza yonke imihla.
Because you know.	Kuba uyazi.
But he works hard.	Kodwa usebenza nzima.
Thank you very much!	Enkosi kakhulu!
At night something strange happened.	Ebusuku kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He sits down and watches.	Uhlala phantsi ujonge.
He never did that.	Akazange akwenze oko.
He needs to know better.	Kufuneka azi ngcono.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
And this should be easy.	Kwaye oku kufuneka kube lula.
You read everything.	Ufunda yonke into.
He took the place in front of me.	Wathatha indawo phambi kwam.
There is, of course, much more.	Kukho, ngokuqinisekileyo, okuninzi ngakumbi.
Or us, maybe.	Okanye nathi, mhlawumbi.
He is.	Nguye.
He knew he loved his father.	Wayesazi ukuba uyamthanda utata wakhe.
This is really difficult.	Oku kunzima ngokwenene.
He is my friend.	Ngumhlobo wam .
Living with him.	Ukuhlala naye.
If you want to do that, fine.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza oko, kulungile.
Travel if possible.	Ukuhamba ukuba kunokwenzeka.
And so will you.	Kwaye nawe uya kuba.
Do not work too hard.	Musa ukusebenza nzima kakhulu.
You do not have to leave right away.	Akufunekanga uhambe kwangoko.
There is a house	Kukho indlu
However this will always be the case.	Nangona kunjalo oku kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
His mother.	Umama wakhe .
Not a bit of it.	Hayi kancinci kuyo.
He thought so.	Wacinga njalo.
Do you want to learn more ???.	Ngaba ufuna ukufunda ngakumbi ???.
I know you told him.	Ndiyazi ukuba umxelele.
To be better.	Ukuba ngcono.
I will do just that.	Ndiya kwenza kanye loo nto.
I just love everything about it.	Ndiyayithanda nje yonke into ngayo.
He talked to her.	Wathetha naye.
That's exactly right.	Kunjalo kanye.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
This is what needs to happen.	Yile nto ekufuneka yenzeke.
He would try.	Wayeza kuzama.
And he abode there.	Wahlala ke apho.
He did not do everything well.	Akenzanga yonke into kakuhle.
So this time just one more time.	Ngoko ngeli xesha nje elinye kwakhona.
I tried to speak.	Ndazama ukuthetha.
One, when you did something wrong.	Enye, xa wenze into engalunganga.
He took a chance.	Wathatha ithuba.
He had to talk to her.	Kwafuneka athethe naye.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into entsha ngokupheleleyo.
I went to school.	Ndaya esikolweni.
You should do this early in the morning.	Kufuneka wenze oku kwangethuba ekuseni.
And it happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka.
Don't forget.	Ungalibali.
He decided to stay.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ahlale.
Yes, almost no one.	Ewe, phantse akukho mntu.
Accommodation.	Indawo yokuhlala.
I had to go there.	Kwafuneka ndiye apho.
But only later.	Kodwa kuphela kamva.
Then it's good again.	Emva koko kuhle kwakhona.
You will probably have to.	Mhlawumbi kuya kufuneka.
Oh no, no way.	Hayi njani, akukho ndlela.
In the end it will be so.	Ekugqibeleni kuya kuba njalo.
And think about it, that would be great.	Uze ucinge ngayo, oko kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
Far from anything.	Kude nantoni na.
Only then, however.	Kuphela ke, nangona kunjalo.
He's gone, then.	Uhambe, ke.
You eat enough.	Utya ngokwaneleyo.
My case, of course.	Ityala lam, kunjalo.
I don't really know anything about it.	Andazi nto ngayo ngenene.
He is tall and well dressed.	Mde kwaye unxibe kakuhle.
I want to help you.	Ndifuna ukukunceda.
Or it seems.	Okanye kubonakala kunjalo.
And about time.	Kwaye malunga nexesha.
Very, very bad.	Kakhulu, kakubi kakhulu.
I did not know then.	Ndandingazi ngoko.
You play a lot.	Udlala kakhulu.
But this takes time.	Kodwa oku kuthatha ixesha.
Then go outside.	Emva koko uhambe ngaphandle.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
I heard about that.	Ndeva ngalonto.
Do not forget that you love her.	Ungalibali ukuba uyamthanda.
I'll go the other way.	Ndiza kuhamba ngenye indlela.
I wanted to tell you something.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela into.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
Thank you so much for that.	Enkosi kakhulu ngaloo nto.
He is doing very well.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu.
I know that is not the case.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
One after another.	Omnye emva komnye.
He agreed to talk to me.	Wavuma ukuthetha nam.
He did not want to tell his parents.	Wayengafuni ukuxelela abazali bakhe.
I thought he would come back.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kubuya.
It will be good for you.	Kuya kuba kuhle kuwe.
That's right.	Ilungile loo nto.
You can't help everyone.	Awunako ukunceda wonke umntu.
That's what he wants more.	Nantso into efuna ngakumbi.
During this work.	Ngexesha lo msebenzi.
He did just that.	Wenza kanye loo nto.
There is plenty of time.	Kukho ixesha elininzi.
Yes, this is it.	Ewe, yiyo le.
You have to look up.	Kufuneka ujonge phezulu.
And that really means something.	Kwaye oku kuthetha into ngenene.
He didn't look like he thought he was right.	Wayengabonakali ngathi wayecinga ukuba ilungile.
But I just mean.	Kodwa ndithetha nje.
In the evening at dinner.	Ngokuhlwa kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
I can walk.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba.
I don't want to look back on that.	Andifuni kuphinda ndijonge emva kuloo nto.
I do not remember.	Andikhumbuli.
At the time he was not there.	Ngelo xesha wayengekho.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni nyani ukuthetha ngayo.
And so it is.	Kwaye kunjalo.
One too.	Enye kakhulu.
And soon he too died.	Kwaye kungekudala naye wafa.
I am not alone.	Ayindim ndedwa.
Not that you have to do it every day.	Akunjalo ukuba kufuneka uyenze yonke imihla.
Although they will.	Nangona baya kwenza.
He was not there yet.	Wayengekho okwangoku.
Because.	Kuba.
I do not have it.	Andinayo.
Maybe you are.	Mhlawumbi unjalo.
Really, really, I hope so.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene, ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo .
Everyone said yes.	Wonke umntu wathi ewe.
You just have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze nje.
I made a mistake though.	Ndenze impazamo kodwa.
It seemed strange to him.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto engaqhelekanga kuye.
But it will be.	Kodwa kuya kuba njalo.
She loves tennis.	Uyayithanda intenetya.
He wants to stay.	Ufuna ukuhlala.
I wanted to talk to you.	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe.
Do you think we should go there?	Ucinga ukuba kufuneka siye apho?
Not me, everyone wanted me to be.	Hayi mna, wonke umntu wayefuna ndibe nguye.
But not that.	Kodwa hayi loo nto.
I had to go.	Kwafuneka ndihambe.
Everyone should try to do their best.	Wonke umntu kufuneka azame ukwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
Or do you think that you did?	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenza njalo.
Or in it.	Okanye kuyo.
I like it a little bit.	Ndiyayithanda kancinci.
What are you doing tonight?	Ingaba wenza ntoni namhlanje ebusuku?
Maybe he also didn't know that.	Mhlawumbi naye wayengazi ukuba.
But it did not really happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene.
What have you done.	Ingaba wenze ntoni.
I feel tired.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo.
I'm up here.	Ndilapha phezulu.
He did not want one or the other.	Akazange afune enye okanye enye.
When you read a book, you read your mind.	Xa ufunda incwadi, ufunda ingqondo yakho.
He just doesn't appear.	Akabonakali nje.
Such a good book.	Incwadi entle ngolo hlobo.
So he did not.	Ngoko akazange.
Nothing and everything.	Akukho nto kwaye yonke into.
I want that from you.	Ndifuna oko kuwe.
I don't know anything else.	Andazi enye into.
He came later.	Weza emva koko.
Both are his parents.	Bobabini abazali bakhe.
I've heard this song before.	Ndikhe ndeva ngale ngoma ngaphambili.
I told you, it's something.	Ndikuxelele, yinto.
I know how to do that.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza oko.
I'm just doing my job.	Ndenza nje umsebenzi wam.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
We will all go.	Siza kuhamba sonke.
He wondered now.	Wazibuza ngoku.
Now, why are you here.	Ngoku, ukuba kutheni ulapha.
You play tennis.	Udlala intenetya.
Do you want to help with dinner?	Ngaba uyafuna ukunceda ngesidlo sangokuhlwa?
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
I knew it was you.	Bendisazi ukuba nguwe lo.
So nothing.	Ngoko ke akukho nto.
He stayed there for a long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide.
And not nearly enough.	Kwaye akukho phantse ngokwaneleyo.
He never did anything big about it.	Akazange enze into enkulu ngayo.
He didn't think, he just did.	Akazange acinge, wenza nje.
I always wanted to.	Ndandifuna njalo.
It was not difficult to find someone.	Kwakungekho nzima ukufumana umntu.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
He will speak only once.	Uya kuthetha kube kanye nje.
Then he saw another one.	Emva koko wabona enye.
There was nothing.	Kwakungekho nto.
In the house.	Endlini.
I want to say two or three things.	Ndifuna ukuthetha izinto ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
Everyone wants that.	Wonke umntu ufuna oko.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
However, one has to try.	Nangona kunjalo, umntu kufuneka azame.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
I can stop.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyeka.
We have to go.	Kufuneka sihambe.
Your name is before me.	Igama lakho phambi kwam.
He wants to die.	Ufuna ukufa.
I did well.	Ndenze kakuhle.
You have to do it your way.	Kufuneka wenze ngendlela yakho.
Strange thing if you want to.	Into engaqhelekanga ukuba ufuna njalo.
And he is.	Kwaye unjalo.
He started going to it.	Waqalisa ukuya kuyo.
It's hard to imagine him walking.	Kunzima ukucinga ukuba uhamba.
Then everyone left.	Emva koko wonke umntu wemka.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Walking at night?	Ukuhamba ebusuku?
I thought about that for a long time.	Ndacinga ngaloo nto ixesha elide.
If not for me.	Ukuba akunjalo kum.
Or you.	Okanye wena.
There is another.	Kukho enye.
Nothing, and never will.	Akukho nto, kwaye soze.
I never thought he was.	Khange ndicinge ukuba unjalo.
We will definitely be back !.	Siza kubuya ngokuqinisekileyo!.
Or, maybe, anytime.	Okanye, mhlawumbi, nanini na.
Not before, not now.	Hayi ngaphambili, hayi ngoku.
But he would take his time.	Kodwa wayeza kuthatha ixesha lakhe.
But clearly this is not possible.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo oku akunakwenzeka.
What does he look like?	Ingaba ubonakala njani?
However, this did not happen.	Nangona, oku akuzange kwenzeke.
I don't even know if I'm doing it right.	Andazi nokuba ndiyenza kakuhle na.
You are as good as you look tonight.	Ulungile njengoko ujonge ngokuhlwanje.
Why me? 	Kutheni mna?
But you should have known better.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
Look at the place.	Jonga indawo.
He kept looking.	Wahlala wajonga.
Deep dive drowning.	Wazama wazama wazama.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
He took his time.	Wathatha ixesha lakhe.
There is nothing there.	Akukho nto apho.
I don't think no one did that.	Andiqondi ukuba akukho mntu wenze njalo.
He really wants me to stay.	Ufuna ndihlale nyani.
He took two.	Wathatha ezimbini.
It takes a person.	Kuthatha umntu.
And you know it.	Kwaye uyayazi.
And still not.	Kwaye nangoku akunjalo.
A new place every day.	Indawo entsha yonke imihla.
He asked me for money.	Oko wandicela imali.
There is something wrong with that.	Kukho into engalunganga apho.
She sat down next to him.	Wahlala ecaleni kwakhe.
He works very hard.	Usebenza kakhulu.
I won't want it any other way.	Andiyi kufuna ngenye indlela.
That's it now.	Yiloo nto ngoku.
Finally he came to her.	Ekugqibeleni weza kuye.
They will wait for you.	Baza kulinda wena.
I hope so, for my own sake.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo, ngenxa yam.
I can do all that.	Ndingayenza yonke loo nto.
You have this.	Unayo lento.
In the long run, you feel good.	Ixesha elide, uziva ulungile.
Something too big, too old.	Into enkulu kakhulu, endala kakhulu.
We went well.	Sihambe kakuhle.
I don't know what else.	Andazi ukuba yintoni enye.
But she seems to like it.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi uyayithanda.
One thing always.	Into enye rhoqo.
This is not for everyone, of course.	Oku ayinguye wonke umntu, kunjalo.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
He wanted another one.	Wayefuna enye.
Then he returned to the house.	Emva koko wabuyela endlini.
But he wanted to.	Kodwa wayefuna.
Yes, if only.	Ewe, ukuba kuphela.
I never thought it was a big deal.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinto enkulu.
This is not easy.	Oku akukho lula.
I hope you have succeeded tonight.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uphumelele ngokuhlwanje.
He does this regularly.	Wenza oku rhoqo.
She is much older than I am.	Mdala kakhulu kunam.
Or he came to her.	Okanye weza kuye.
Tell me, tell me.	Ndixelele, ndixelele.
And one.	Kwaye enye.
It will be easier.	Kuya kuba lula ngakumbi.
He would not be able to do this.	Wayengayi kukwazi ukuyenza le nto.
He looked at his friends.	Wajonga abahlobo bakhe.
This is not the right way right now.	Le ayisiyiyo indlela elungileyo kwangoko.
He looks bad.	Ukhangeleka embi.
Maybe I don't have much time.	Mhlawumbi andinaxesha elininzi.
How would he return.	Wayeza kubuya njani.
Not really, though.	Akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
And there was nothing.	Kwaye kwakungekho nto.
Not me.	Hayi nam.
It’s certainly not just about that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho malunga naloo nto kuphela.
I think he wanted to.	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna.
And, of course,.	Kwaye, kunjalo,.
As we will now.	Njengoko siza kwenza ngoku.
I don't know how I can do that.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
He told her he could do it himself.	Wamxelela ukuba angayenza ngokwakhe.
You have made a decision.	Wenze isigqibo.
A book, perhaps.	Incwadi, mhlawumbi.
At the time he said everything was fine.	Ngelo xesha wathi yonke into ilungile.
Not far from here.	Akukho kude apha.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
Yes.	Ewe.
If you want to do a test now, we will do it now.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza uvavanyo ngoku, siza kuyenza ngoku.
And that's it.	Kwaye yiloo nto.
If you really go through this.	Ukuba ngokwenene uhamba ngale nto.
He was coming, he had looked back.	Wayeza, uye wajonga ngasemva.
I don't want to say anything.	Andifuni kuthetha nantoni na.
The problem is his work.	Ingxaki ngumsebenzi wakhe.
Not really.	Akukho nyani.
Well, you know, there is that.	Ke, uyazi, kukho loo nto.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa oko akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
I'm sure you're tired.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba udiniwe.
I want to know if you can do that.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
But that was not the case.	Kodwa yayingenguye lowo.
It would be nice for everyone except me.	Bekuya kuba kuhle kuye wonke umntu ngaphandle kwam.
If there is no place, there is no place.	Ukuba akukho ndawo, akukho ndawo.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhlale ekhaya namhlanje.
Maybe you want to talk.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuthetha.
That's what it means to me.	Nantso into ethetha yona kum.
I'm glad you're here.	Ndiyavuya ulapha.
In his own way.	Ngendlela yakhe.
He told her about his work.	Wamxelela ngomsebenzi wakhe.
He did not want to tell.	Wayengafuni ukuxelela.
Someone was going to leave.	Umntu wayeza kuhamba.
He said thank you.	Wathi enkosi.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi.
Be there.	Uzakuba lapho.
Another three hours.	Ezinye iiyure ezintathu.
But do nothing.	Kodwa musa ukwenza nto.
He went to it.	Waya kuyo.
Not just you.	Hayi wena wedwa.
There is no place to do anything else.	Akukho ndawo yokwenza enye into.
For me.	Kum nje.
And he did just that.	Kwaye wenza ngathi.
You must have it.	Kumele ukuba unayo.
One day, he thought.	Ngenye imini, wacinga.
Well, you don't want to.	Kulungile, awufuni.
It seems to us though.	Kubonakala ngathi kodwa.
Do you love money.	Ngaba uyayithanda imali.
So if you are not going to take the money.	Ngoko ke ukuba awuyi kuthatha imali.
I saw him in the morning for breakfast.	Ndimbone ekuseni ngesidlo sakusasa.
I told you there.	Ndikuxelele apho.
But there is no time now.	Kodwa akukho xesha ngoku.
If you want to meet him that's fine with us.	Ukuba ufuna ukudibana naye kulungile nathi.
Everyone tried to get there.	Wonke umntu wazama ukuya apho.
He is about to do it.	Sele eza kuyenza.
But no, of course not.	Kodwa hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
He thought this was a good thing.	Wayecinga ukuba le yinto elungileyo.
Thinking before you act.	Ukucinga phambi kokuba enze.
It will do it again.	Iza kuyenza kwakhona.
Does the bus always arrive?	Ngaba ibhasi iza rhoqo?
Driving to the office.	Ukuqhuba ukuya eofisini.
I just want a small one.	Ndifuna nje encinci.
Yes, bedtime now.	Ewe, ixesha lokulala ngoku.
Three hours late.	Iiyure ezintathu emva kwexesha.
It could be true.	Inokuba yinyani.
It will require work.	Kuya kufuna umsebenzi.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He may not go.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba akayi.
The marriage was.	Umtshato waba.
Surely that is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
So he had to know.	Ngoko ke kwafuneka azi.
I thought you were here for me.	Bendicinga ukuba ulapha kum.
I couldn't do it.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza.
The problem is that someone else will start in his place.	Ingxaki kukuba omnye umntu uza kuqala kwindawo yakhe.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
I even wonder if.	Ndiyazibuza nokuba.
But only for you.	Kodwa kuwe kuphela.
So, yes, yes.	Ngoko, ewe, ewe.
A beautiful woman.	Umfazi omhle.
Where anything can happen.	Apho kunokwenzeka nantoni na.
He works there.	Usebenza apho.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I had to tell someone, anyone.	Kwafuneka ndixelele umntu, nabani na.
This is the case.	Yile meko.
And one more thing.	Kwaye enye into.
Maybe you're busy.	Mhlawumbi uxakekile.
Then the books.	Emva koko iincwadi.
I've never been there before today.	Andizange ndiye phaya ngaphambili namhlanje.
What happened next.	Kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
I don't think you like it very much.	Andiqondi ukuba uyayithanda kakhulu.
And there it is.	Kwaye kukho.
As you may know.	Njengoko usenokuba uyazi.
Where he wants to go.	Apho afuna ukuya khona.
When you feel like nothing.	Xa uziva ukuba akukho nto.
No, no one.	Hayi, akukho namnye.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
There is nothing to do now.	Akukho kwanto yokwenza ngoku.
He knew so much.	Wayesazi kangako.
Great thing, though.	Into enkulu, nokuba.
Again, play.	Kwakhona, ukudlala.
So, what are you going to do?	Ke, uza kwenza ntoni?
Eventually, it happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka.
I knew what it was like to try something big.	Ndandisazi ukuba yintoni na ukuzama into enkulu.
Then he told me a story.	Emva koko wandixelela ibali.
He went alone.	Wahamba yedwa.
But he knew too much.	Kodwa wayesazi kakhulu.
It seemed to us.	Kwakubonakala ngathi.
He did not try to get to know anyone.	Akazange azame ukwazi nabani na.
But that will not happen.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka.
Maybe it was nothing.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho nto.

That will surely be soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kuya kuba kungekudala.
You know how to do it now.	Uyazi ukuba ukwenza njani ngoku.

If you stayed long enough.	Ukuba wahlala ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
You know, if you feel it.	Uyazi, ukuba uziva.
I do not know exactly what is going on.	Andazi ncam ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.

One in the morning, one in the afternoon.	Enye ekuseni, enye emva kwemini.
You will do very well.	Uya kwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
But it did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke.
Everyone does their job.	Wonke umntu wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
But this is just the beginning.	Kodwa oku kuqala.
He wanted to be there very badly.	Wayefuna ukuba lapho kakubi kakhulu.
He stayed that way for a long time.	Wahlala enjalo ixesha elide.
Yes he told me about it.	Ewe wandixelela ngayo.
They live hard.	Bahlala nzima.
We'll get to that.	Siza kufika kuloo nto.
Maybe one day it will happen.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini kuya kwenzeka.
I will not return.	Andiyi kubuya.
There is no question about that.	Akukho mbuzo ngaloo nto.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
Are you willing to try again?	Uzimisele ukuzama kwakhona?
Then, finally, finally.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni, ekugqibeleni.
Are you sure you would like to do that?	Ngaba uqinisekile ukuba ungathanda ukwenza oko?
This time it is not.	Ngeli xesha akunjalo.
But not like you.	Kodwa hayi njengawe.
I think it will be a very good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba yinto entle kakhulu.
You spend a lot of time with him lately.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi kunye naye mva nje.
My son is like that.	Unyana wam unjalo.
But you first.	Kodwa wena kuqala.
Now, his wife is gone.	Ngoku, umfazi wakhe akakho.
But for now, it will be you.	Kodwa okwangoku, iya kuba nguwe.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba sihambe.
The children go to school.	Abantwana baya esikolweni.
But he soon realized that he could not.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza waqonda ukuba akanakukwazi.
One person walked out of my house.	Umntu omnye waphuma endlwini yam.
Not so much, of course.	Hayi kakhulu, kunjalo.
That might be okay.	Inokuba kulungile.
They will make a decision.	Baya kuthatha isigqibo.
I am very happy thank you.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu enkosi.
Your people.	Abantu bakho.

You are going to stay away.	Uya kude uhlale.
He did not think.	Akazange acinge.
You know it now.	Uyayazi ngoku.
You may be really angry.	Usenokuba nomsindo ngokwenene.
However, it has been very fun.	Nangona kunjalo, kube mnandi kakhulu.

You did a good job here.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle apha.
The answer, of course, is very strong.	Impendulo, kunjalo, kakhulu.
Why are you here?	Kutheni ulapha?
I know that and you know it.	Ndiyayazi lonto nawe uyayazi lonto.
It has to be the other way around.	Kufuneka kube ngenye indlela.
No one.	Akukho namnye.
But you have to go.	Kodwa kufuneka uhambe.
Learning to live with me will be difficult.	Ukufunda ukuhlala nam kuya kuba nzima.
That or maybe you did something wrong.	Oko okanye mhlawumbi wenze into engalunganga.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi yayingenguye.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
No matter how much he wanted it.	Nokuba wayefuna kangakanani na.
He came at night.	Weza ebusuku.
He too wanted to get out.	Naye wayefuna ukuphuma.
He sat inside.	Wahlala ngaphakathi.

Nothing but.	Akukho nto kodwa.
And so, too.	Kwaye kunjalo, kakhulu.
Yes it was obvious.	Ewe kwakucacile.
It is not his decision to make.	Asiyonto yakhe yokwenza isigqibo.
I could not.	Andikwazanga.
Now everyone does.	Ngoku wonke umntu wenza njalo.
I know it too.	Nam ndiyazi.
He did two things.	Wenza izinto ezimbini.
Now he just looked away.	Ngoku wajonga ecaleni kuphela.
There was nothing wrong with him.	Kwakungekho nto kuye.
Being there with friends.	Ukuba apho kunye nabahlobo.

That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
But you can do it.	Kodwa ungayenza.
I didn't really want to know.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukwazi.
I could not tell you why.	Andikwazanga ukukuxelela ukuba kutheni.
He is better off without her.	Ungcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
I didn’t think it was just a thing.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinto nje.
Whether a party or not.	Nokuba itheko okanye hayi.
I never spoke again.	Khange ndiphinde ndithethe.
He ate well.	Watya kakuhle.
He came to the office looking for work.	Weza eofisini efuna umsebenzi.
There is nothing here for him.	Akukho nto apha kuye.

You have to stay home.	Kufuneka uhlale ekhaya.
I will not speak again.	andisayi kuphinda ndithethe.
I'm just tired now.	Ndidiniwe nje ngoku.

I want to see your work.	Ndifuna ukubona umsebenzi wakho.

It would be easy then.	Bekuya kuba lula ke ngoko.
No, it is not.	Hayi, akunakwenzeka.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
Because that's good.	Kuba oko kuhle.
Nothing had happened and he was not at the top.	Kwakungekho nto yenzekileyo kwaye wayengekho phezulu.
So tell me.	Ndixelele ke.
Shortly thereafter, he died.	Kungekudala emva koko, wafa.
I mean, a little bit, okay.	Ndithetha, kancinci, kulungile.
Don't learn too much from this.	Musa ukufunda kakhulu kule nto.
No one knew where he was.	Akukho mntu wayesazi apho.

He will be back soon.	Uza kubuya kungekudala.
I want to do a lot of things.	Ndifuna ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
I don’t remember feeling like this before.	Andikhumbuli ndiziva ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
He tried again, but failed.	Wazama kwakhona, kodwa akazange aphumelele.
He ate dinner last night.	Uye watya isidlo sangokuhlwa phezolo.
It is not just money.	Ayisiyiyo kuphela imali.
He may not even know you.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba naye akazi ngawe.
So there was no way.	Ngoko kwakungekho ndlela.
I want money.	Ndifuna imali.
No one went to see it.	Akukho mntu waya kubona.
In the city, most of the time.	Edolophini, ixesha elininzi.

We want to play football.	Sifuna ukudlala ibhola.
It is the same with him.	Kunjalo kuye.

Or too high.	Okanye kakhulu phezulu.
You are right.	Ulungile.
Anything.	Nantoni na.
But what do you think ?.	Kodwa ucinga ntoni?.

I was never there.	Andizange ndibe khona.
Previously, if you need to know.	Ngaphambili, ukuba kufuneka wazi.

Man did all that.	Umntu wayenza yonke loo nto.
Slowly, he looked up.	Kancinci, wajonga phezulu.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
That's right.	Yinyani loo nto.

Not too low, not too high.	Hayi phantsi kakhulu, hayi phezulu kakhulu.
This is nowhere.	Oku akukho ndawo.
It’s hard to see how they’re going to make a lot of money.	Kunzima ukubona ukuba baya kwenza njani imali eninzi.

You are confident that you will succeed.	Uqinisekile ukuba uya kuphumelela.
You can be anything.	Unokuba nantoni na.
He did not know what had happened.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.

He died doing his job.	Wafa esenza umsebenzi wakhe.

You are late.	Ufike mva.
And you want to know why.	Kwaye ufuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Sorry?	Uxolo?

Or whatever this happens.	Okanye nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na oku.
To me, that means a lot.	Kum, oko kuthetha kakhulu.
It's just hard for me.	Kunzima nje kum.

You did a good job there.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle apho.

Hard working.	Usebenza nzima.
Something very happening.	Into eyenzekayo kakhulu.
You what?.	Wena ntoni?.
It will not be difficult.	Akuyi kuba nzima.
I knew nothing about this.	Ndandingazi nto ngale nto.
All of this will have to happen.	Konke oku kuya kufuneka kwenzeke.
When you learn to drive, money will be hard.	Xa ufunda ukuqhuba, imali iya kuba nzima.
He took up a lot of space.	Wathatha indawo eninzi.
Let's go and.	Makhe kwaye.

I have to get there.	Kufuneka ndifike apho.
I would be a better person.	Ndiya kuba ngumntu ongcono.
Everyone must help us.	Wonke umntu kufuneka asincede.
It is very true.	Yinyani kakhulu.
He did something very strange.	Wenza into engaqhelekanga.
And you know it.	Kwaye nawe uyazi.

And that's a doctor.	Kwaye lowo ngugqirha.
No one has a problem with this, except me.	Akukho mntu unengxaki ngale nto, ngaphandle kwam.
You will not stay.	Awuyi kuhlala.

He wanted her to leave.	Wayefuna ukuba ahambe.
You arrived on time.	Ufike ngexesha.
I know the way.	Ndiyayazi indlela.
You must always tell the truth.	Kufuneka usoloko uthetha inyaniso.
All right, then.	Kulungile, ngoko.
But he was not here.	Kodwa wayengekho apha.
In fact.	Inyaniso.
If you have it, you are lucky.	Ukuba unayo, unethamsanqa.

You are going there.	Uya khona.
I want to know who did it.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba ngubani owenze loo nto.
And now, suffice it to say, you're tired.	Kwaye ngoku, ngokwaneleyo uthe, udiniwe.
His life there he knew little.	Ubomi bakhe apho wayesazi kancinci.
Maybe they live at home.	Mhlawumbi bahlala ekhaya.
This has been fun.	Oku kube mnandi.
He thought he was saying something about it.	Wayecinga ukuba uthetha into ngayo.
Location is OK.	Indawo ilungile.
It is time for him to speak.	Lixesha lokuba athethe.
One of us, now.	Omnye wethu, ngoku.
She was scared.	Wayesoyika.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
Which is wrong.	Yeyiphi engalunganga.
I made my way to it.	Ndenza indlela yam ukuya kuyo.

He is going to do this now.	Uza kuyenza le nto ngoku.
It's not easy.	Akukho lula nje.
Unless you are.	Ngaphandle kokuba unjalo.
But no one will do it.	Kodwa akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
You like this thing.	Uyayithanda le nto.
I thought, this is very good.	Ndacinga, oku kuhle kakhulu.
Suddenly I want to be with him.	Ngokukhawuleza ndifuna ukuba kunye naye.
There was no need for him to say anything.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe nto.
He never did.	Zange enjenjalo.
What is so unusual about it? 	Yintoni engaqhelekanga ngayo?
Everyone said the same thing, after that.	Wonke umntu wathetha into enye, emva koko.
It is also very difficult to do.	Kwakhona kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
But you can't go with us.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhamba nathi.
There is something in every age.	Kukho into kuyo yonke iminyaka.
Just look.	Jonga nje.
Not later.	Akukho kamva.
In a big way.	Ngendlela enkulu.
But in the end he did.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wenza.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
In this way, it is not.	Ngale ndlela, akunjalo.
Coming or going backwards.	Ukuza okanye ukuhamba emva.
I didn't, no.	Andizange, hayi.
This person is a person.	Lo mntu ngumntu.
Thanks to you.	Enkosi kuwe.
One or the other.	Enye okanye enye.
Just last night, and now again.	Kanye phezolo, kwaye ngoku kwakhona.
I came to see my father.	Ndize kubona utata.
You know they're going too high right now.	Uyazi ukuba baya phezulu kakhulu ngoku.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokwenene kunjalo.
It doesn't have to be big.	Akufuneki kube yinto enkulu.
All, that's right.	Konke, kunjalo.
He did not know what he was doing.	Wayengazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
Yeah, everything.	Ewe, yonke into.
But, one day, you go too far.	Kodwa, ngenye imini, uya kude kakhulu.
But only one woman.	Kodwa umfazi omnye kuphela.
And for me.	Kwaye kum.
Before bedtime.	Ngaphambi kwexesha lokulala.
Thinking about something is good.	Ukucinga ngento kulungile.
I am a very good person.	Ndingumntu olungileyo kakhulu.
My son does not want me.	Unyana wam akafuni kum.
I knew she had done it before.	Ndandisazi ukuba wakha wakwenza oko.
We will have a party.	Siza kwenza itheko.
You do not want to do this.	Awufuni ukwenza oku.
Look at the picture.	Jonga umfanekiso.
I personally do not want that to happen.	Mna ngokwam andifuni ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
Just about this here.	Kanye ngale nto apha.
When did you leave home?	Wemka nini ekhaya?
Then we will get questions.	Emva koko siya kufumana imibuzo.
Or maybe you too.	Okanye mhlawumbi nawe.
What did I tell you, though.	Ndikuxelele ntoni, nangona kunjalo.
I really wanted to.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene.
It's just too big.	Yinto nje enkulu kakhulu.
He said confidently.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He can't stay long.	Akakwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
There was no place there.	Kwakungekho ndawo apho.
Nothing happened to him.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo kuye.
This is me!	Ndim lo!
Not both of us.	Hayi sobabini.

Although difficult.	Nangona kunzima.
Help is needed.	Kufuneka uncedo.
Looks like there is.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
He looked back at her.	Wajonga emva kuye.
You will only continue to get better.	Uya kuqhubeka kuphela ukuba ngcono.
His singing in this.	Ukucula kwakhe kule nto.
Weeks, though.	Iiveki, nangona.
But no, it was not.	Kodwa hayi, akuzange kube njalo.
But we will be together soon.	Kodwa siza kuba kunye kungekudala.
It should not have been.	Bekungafanelanga.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
Have you heard anything about him?	Ngaba ukhe weva nto ngaye?
And that will not be easy.	Kwaye oko akuyi kuba lula.
I will take your word for it.	Ndiya kuthatha ilizwi lakho kuyo.
Time for me to go too.	Ixesha lokuba nam ndihambe.
Thanks in advance for the way.	Enkosi ngaphambili ngendlela.
Maybe they'll come back eventually.	Mhlawumbi baya kubuya ekugqibeleni.
You want a new coat.	Ufuna idyasi entsha.
I have to be inside you.	Kufuneka ndibe ngaphakathi kuwe.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
He looked inside it.	Wajonga ngaphakathi kuyo.
Suddenly, he realized.	Ngokukhawuleza, waqonda.
Looks like you like it.	Kubonakala ngathi uyayithanda.
I thought so too.	Nam ndiye ndacinga.
None.	Akukho.
I'm sorry to say, but it's true.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuthetha, kodwa yinyani.
It has always been so.	Kudala kunjalo.
I think he did.	Ndicinga ukuba uyenzile.
He would really try.	Wayeza kuzama ngokwenene.
I did not want to leave.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
You have to go to school every day.	Kufuneka uye esikolweni yonke imihla.
It's not fun.	Akukho mnandi.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni.
Good job.	Umsebenzi olungileyo.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje.
And no one is talking to anyone.	Kwaye akukho mntu uthetha mntu.
We should be angry with each other.	Sifanele sibe nomsindo omnye komnye.
If not now, when ?.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, nini?.
That's it today.	Nto leyo namhlanje.
No one told her anything.	Akukho mntu wamxelela nto.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle .
There are mistakes.	Kukho iimpazamo.
And it was never done.	Kwaye ayizange yenziwe.
I know that for sure.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
Maybe one day it will.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini kuya kuba njalo.
I'm really sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa ngenene.
I am very happy to meet you.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukudibana nawe.
That can be difficult right away.	Oko kunokuba nzima ngokukhawuleza.
Or if you do.	Okanye ukuba wenza .
At the time, it seemed like a big deal.	Ngelo xesha, kwakubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
I wonder who he might be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba ngubani na.
There are, however, two exceptions.	Kukho, nangona kunjalo, ezimbini ngaphandle.
Weeks too early.	Iiveki kwangoko kakhulu.
He didn't say anything, though.	Akazange athethe nto, nangona kunjalo.
I did not go there.	Khange ndiye apho.
I'm gone now.	Ndihambe ngoku.
Shortly thereafter, he fell asleep.	Kungekudala emva koko, walala.
Not just for him.	Akukho nje kuye.
He told her to sit next to him.	Wamxelela ukuba ahlale ecaleni kwakhe.
No one talked too much.	Akukho mntu wathetha kakhulu.
But there is something somewhere.	Kodwa kukho into ethile kwindawo ethile.
She is doing well.	Uhamba kakuhle.
Sorry, everyone, he thought.	Uxolo, wonke umntu, wacinga.
And he is very tired.	Kwaye udiniwe kakhulu.
Do not stay too long.	Musa ukuhlala ixesha elide kakhulu.
Just as it can be.	Kanye njengoko kunokuba njalo.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
It's been great.	Kube kuhle.
Her son needs help.	Unyana wakhe ufuna uncedo.
Great thing, really.	Into enkulu, ngokwenene.
Nice to have you.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nawe.
You work on it.	Usebenza kuyo.
Bad, bad mistake.	Impazamo embi, embi.
It did not always happen.	Ayizange yenzeke rhoqo.
I am therefore okay.	Mna ke ngoko kulungile.
Travel as fast and as fast as possible.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
Man at the top.	Umntu phezulu.
That is your job.	Ngumsebenzi wakho lowo.
You know, how you feel about that.	Uyazi, uziva njani ngaloo nto.
If not, don't.	Ukuba akunjalo, musa.
I don't think he will ever win big.	Andiqondi ukuba uya kuze aphumelele enkulu.
You have made a lot of money with him.	Wenze imali eninzi naye.
No one really does.	Akukho mntu wenza ngokwenene.
We never did that.	Asizange siyenze loo nto.
I did not know.	Bendingazi.
It will be seen that that will happen.	Kuza kubonakala ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
Thank you thank you thank you !.	Enkosi enkosi enkosi!.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenze loo nto.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
You.	Wena.
Well if you are right.	Kulungile ukuba ulungile.
But he was not thinking clearly then.	Kodwa wayengacingi ngokucacileyo ngoko.
Just a few weeks.	Iiveki nje ezimbalwa.
If you are really serious.	Ukuba uzimisele ngokwenene.
So much for me.	Kangakanani ke kum.
The problem is, you need to know how to do it.	Ingxaki kukuba kufuneka ukwazi ukwenza njani.
And you never did.	Kwaye awuzange wenze njalo.
This should never happen again.	Oku akufanele kwenzeke kwakhona.
I will find a way.	Ndiza kufumana indlela.
That is very difficult to do.	Oko kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
I'm so glad to be here with you.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba lapha kunye nawe.
No, but it seemed.	Akunjalo, kodwa kwakubonakala kunjalo.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi kuthetha.
She was afraid to be alone.	Wayesoyika ukuba yedwa.
For I am not that one.	Kuba ayindim lowo.
I learned something new today.	Ndifunde into entsha namhlanje.
No one needs to do anything to make this happen.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze nantoni na ukuze oku kwenzeke.
You know it's true.	Uyazi ukuba yinyani.
There is one problem, though.	Kukho ingxaki enye, nangona kunjalo.
It could be otherwise.	Kunokuba ngenye indlela.
I never told her.	Zange ndimxelele.
I can't wait to play.	Andikwazi kulinda ukudlala.
He lay alone on the bed.	Walala yedwa ebhedini.
There was no way he could agree.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokuba avume.
And then it happened again.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka kwakhona.
You may have done this.	Inokuba uyenzile le nto.
No one should be here.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba apha.
However, it does not have to be this way.	Nangona kunjalo, akufuneki ukuba kube njalo.
In the same way.	Ngendlela efanayo.
Almost everyone plays soccer.	Phantse wonke umntu udlala ibhola.
Yeah, that's just the thing.	Ewe, ukuba yinto nje.
What happened to him?	Kwenzeka ntoni kuye?
How long.	Ixesha elingakanani.
I will be able to meet.	Ndiya kukwazi ukudibana.
He went into his house.	Wangena endlini yakhe.
And he went in to speak with her.	Wangena ke ukuba athethe naye.
But you must be determined.	Kodwa kufuneka uzimisele.
We know where you work.	Siyazi apho usebenza khona.
What needs to be done.	Yintoni into ekufuneka yenziwe.
It could be him alone.	Inokuba nguye yedwa.
It will always be that way.	Kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
He wanted people.	Wayefuna abantu.
Besides, a great book.	Ngaphandle koko, incwadi enkulu.
And now here.	Kwaye ngoku apha.
Take a look.	Ujonge kancinci.
Are you there.	Ukhona.
I did not want to be here.	Ndandingafuni ukuba lapha.
The accident happened yesterday afternoon.	Le ngozi yenzeke izolo emva kwemini.
But it wasn't him.	Kodwa yayingenguye.
You can do this.	Ungayenza le nto.
It seemed like a long time.	Kwakubonakala ixesha elide.
No one wants that !.	Akukho mntu ufuna loo nto!.
You better go now.	Kungcono uhambe ngoku.
No one knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi.
He went inside.	Wangena ngaphakathi.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
I never told you.	Andizange ndikuxelele.
Like this?	Ndiyayithanda lento?
I'm sure you know who he is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayazi ukuba ngubani.
I do that very well.	Ndiyenza kakuhle kakhulu loo nto.
But in a strange way.	Kodwa ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
Stop reading.	Ukuyeka ukufunda.
Do nothing.	Musa ukwenza nantoni na.
Maybe he knew.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi.
He told her it was going well.	Wamxelela ukuba kuqhubeka kakuhle.
It just wasn't enough.	Kuphela nje ayizange ngokwaneleyo.
He could not get out to her.	Akazange akwazi ukuphuma aye kuye.
You want to do things.	Ufuna ukwenza izinto.
And there was someone else in the room.	Kwaye kukho omnye umntu egumbini.
That is our job.	Ngumsebenzi wethu lowo.
But even so.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo.
And you know it.	Kwaye uyasazi.
Then do it again.	Uze uyenze kwakhona.
Everyone does it.	Wonke umntu uyayenza.
He does not want wealth.	Akafuni mali.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
We will be the first again all the way.	Siya kuba ngowokuqala kwakhona yonke indlela.
I'm talking about it here.	Ndithetha ngayo apha.
He wanted her to have everything.	Wayefuna ukuba abe nayo yonke into.
I was thinking now.	Bendicinga ngoku.
I made my decision.	Ndenze isigqibo sam.
I don't know, not really.	Andazi, hayi ngokwenene.
And she was completely dressed.	Kwaye wayenxibe ngokupheleleyo.
He says he is busy.	Uthi uxakekile.
He did not know what was going on.	Wayengazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
You have to be good.	Kufuneka ube ulungile.
But the doctor understood.	Kodwa ugqirha waqonda.
I will find the error.	Ndiza kufumana impazamo.
Not the first.	Hayi kuqala.
But he left.	Kodwa wemka.
I mean people.	Ndithetha abantu.
No, no, not me.	Hayi, hayi, hayi mna.
His job requires him to travel a lot.	Umsebenzi wakhe ufuna ukuba ahambe kakhulu.
Some will buy food.	Abanye baya kuthenga ukutya.
Everyone is fine.	Wonke umntu ulungile.
And then.	Kwaye emva koko.
And he was afraid now.	Wayesoyika ke ngoku.
I was thinking about you a lot.	Bendicinga ngawe kakhulu.
She is OK now.	Uhamba kakuhle ngoku.
He finally understood.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda.
You know that's true.	Uyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
He felt so much better.	Waziva engcono kakhulu.
Otherwise, it is not.	Ngaphandle koko, akunjalo.
But it was good.	Kodwa kube kuhle.
I think things.	Ndicinga izinto.
They are everywhere, obviously.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo, ngokucacileyo.
But he lives in the same place.	Kodwa uhlala kwindawo enye.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi ngokwenene leyo.
And then the meal.	Kwaye ke isidlo.
Someone has to say something.	Kufuneka umntu athethe into.
There was no need for him to think long.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba acinge ixesha elide.
But he did not know.	Kodwa wayengazi.
Time now.	Ixesha ngoku.
Many questions.	Imibuzo emininzi.
And now, it happens at home.	Kwaye ngoku, kwenzeka ekhaya.
I don't know what you're trying to do.	Andazi ukuba uzama ukwenza ntoni.
I don't have time for myself.	Andinaxesha lam.
It takes time to learn something well.	Kuthatha ixesha ukufunda into kakuhle.
Going to dinner maybe.	Ukuya kwisidlo mhlawumbi.
There was no need for him to say anything else.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe enye into.
You know that place well.	Uyazi kakuhle loo ndawo.
He knows your way.	Uyayazi indlela yakho.
They live well.	Bahlala kakuhle.
But it seems possible.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kunokwenzeka.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
I want you to stay here.	Ndifuna uhlala apha.
He knows many things.	Wazi izinto ezininzi.
Then we go.	Emva koko siye .
He gave me money.	Wandinika imali.
I want one.	Ndifuna enye.
My mother asked me why.	Umama wandibuza ukuba kutheni naye.
As you read ?.	Njengoko ufunda ?.
I had to look back.	Kwafuneka ndijonge ngasemva.
But it will not always be that way.	Kodwa akuyi kuhlala kunjalo.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
And my father did not know.	Kwaye utata akazange azi.
But that is not the case in this case.	Kodwa akunjalo kule meko.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
You need to know this.	Kufuneka uyazi oku.
He did not live above anyone else.	Akazange ahlale ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
She has decided to tell him.	Uye wagqiba ekubeni axelele.
If you want to go, you will do the same.	Ukuba ufuna ukuhamba, uya kuyenza loo nto nawe.
In my work.	Emsebenzini wam.
Of course, this time they will do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ngeli xesha baya kuyenza.
Now he knew what this was all about.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
I couldn't wait to try another one.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuzama enye.
However, it is not that easy.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
It really was necessary.	Kwafuneka ngokwenene.
I think he can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza.
Now may be the time.	Ngoku inokuba lixesha.
Apparently not.	Kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
He continued to leave the house.	Waqhubeka waphuma endlini.
And we all know what's going to happen then.	Kwaye sonke siyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni na ngoko.
He does anything.	Wenza nantoni na.
Not just in the beginning.	Hayi nje ekuqaleni.
He wanted a life without me.	Wayefuna ubomi ngaphandle kwam.
No one else does much to help.	Akakho omnye umntu owenza okuninzi ukunceda.
In fact, this is exactly what happened.	Ngokwenene, oku kwenzeka kanye.
I can't seem to make that happen.	Andikwazi kubonakala ngathi yenzeke loo nto.
But not the food.	Kodwa hayi ukutya.
I'm not sure why.	Andazi ncam ukuba kutheni.
He is determined to do just that.	Uzimisele ukwenza oko yonke imihla.
He will have to learn more.	Kuya kufuneka afunde ngakumbi.
You look at the controversy.	Wajonga utata.
Either way, someone will be with you this afternoon.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, umntu uzakuba nawe ngale mvakwemini.
You are here.	Ulapha.
We will do this next week.	Siza kuyenza le nto kwiveki ezayo.
And he was never angry or upset.	Kwaye akazange abe nomsindo okanye abe buhlungu.
I see you're asleep, no.	Ndijonge ukuba ulele, hayi.
Death can be wonderful.	Ukufa kunokuba mnandi.
If you want to know.	Ukuba ufuna ukwazi.
In the meantime, we have to go.	Okwangoku, kufuneka sihambe.
We'll see for sure.	Siza kubona ngokuqinisekileyo.
I will stay here again.	Ndiza kuhlala apha kwakhona.
He soon learned another way.	Kungekudala wafunda ngenye indlela.
He knew that he did not have to try hard.	Wayesazi ukuba akuyomfuneko ukuba azame ngamandla.
Again, my apologies to you for that.	Kwakhona, uxolo lwam kuwe ngaloo nto.
But he did not stay with her for long.	Kodwa akazange abe naye ixesha elide.
No one, however, is good at everything.	Akukho mntu, nangona kunjalo, ulungile kuyo yonke into.
But he began to think about it.	Kodwa waqalisa ukucinga ngayo.
And a little bit.	Kwaye kancinci.
And it will not be.	Kwaye akuyi kuba.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
He also did not want to.	Naye wayengafuni.
He did not know how he got here.	Wayengazi ukuba ufike njani apha.
The woman is looking at you.	Umfazi ujonge kuwe.
But it is not, and it is not.	Kodwa akunjalo, kwaye akunjalo.
I know what he wants.	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo.
I doubt it though.	Ndiyathandabuza kodwa.
What to do?	Ukwenza ntoni?
You are better than me.	Ungcono kunam.
She's fine, though.	Ulungile, nangona kunjalo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
He did not know that something was wrong.	Wayengazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
You're out of time.	Uye waphuma ixesha.
I don't understand what the problem is.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
He did not know that this would happen.	Wayengazi ukuba iya kufika lento.
Not old, not new.	Hayi endala, hayi entsha.
She is OK, but not the best one.	Ulungile, kodwa hayi lo ulungile.
This, perhaps, is clear.	Oku, mhlawumbi, kucacile.
Yes, it is not easy.	Ewe, akukho lula.
It's too good to be coming.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba uze.
And now.	Kwaye ngoku.
Although it seems more.	Nangona kubonakala ngakumbi.
What's the matter.	Yintoni ingxaki.
But he did not appear there.	Kodwa akazange abonakale apho.
But not my mother.	Kodwa hayi umama wam.
And yes, we want money too.	Kwaye ewe, sifuna imali nathi.
Sooner or later, you think about everything.	Kungekudala okanye kamva, ucinga ngayo yonke into.
I do not go to school.	Andiyi esikolweni.
The others sit down.	Abanye bahlala phantsi.
But he tries to come to me.	Kodwa uzama ukuza kum.
I don't have to do anything.	Akufunekanga ndenze nto.
Give me a name now.	Ndinike igama ngoku.
Getting there.	Ukuya apho.
Just my thing.	Into yam nje.
I'm glad you're here today.	Ndiyavuya ulapha namhlanje.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
I've thought about it a lot.	Ndiye ndacinga ngayo kakhulu.
Therefore	Ngoko ke
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
Soon he came to her.	Kungekudala weza kuyo.
Or that seemed to us.	Okanye oko kwakubonakala ngathi.
She is reading a book.	Ufunda incwadi.
Don't buy.	Musa ukuthenga.
But this did not happen.	Kodwa oku akuzange kwenzeke.
No one knew much about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kakhulu ngayo.
And then there was no one.	Kwaye ke kwakungekho namnye.
Thank you for that.	Enkosi ngaloo nto.
Because that will happen.	Kuba kuya kwenzeka loo nto.
I made money.	Ndenze imali.
Like this.	Ndiyayithanda lento.
We'll just stay here.	Siza kuhlala nje apha.
And especially the music.	Kwaye ngakumbi umculo.
Yes, except for one.	Ewe, ngaphandle komnye.
Then I thought about it.	Ndiye ndacinga ndacinga ngayo.
All is well now.	Konke kulungile ngoku.
He may have spoken more.	Usenokuba wathetha ngakumbi.
Just having it.	Ukuba nayo nje.
He looked at the new woman in it.	Wajonga umfazi omtsha kuyo.
I've always wanted to know about that.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukwazi ngalonto.
You will have to wait another two days.	Kuya kufuneka ulinde ezinye iintsuku ezimbini.
At first, there is none.	Ekuqaleni, akukho namnye.
It's me.	Ndim.
At first it is so.	Ekuqaleni kunjalo.
Well, you have to come tomorrow, too.	Ewe, kufuneka uze ngomso, nawe.
I would like to help you.	Ndingathanda ukukunceda.
I don’t care about time.	Andikhathali ngexesha.
His room, where a lot has happened.	Igumbi lakhe, apho kwenzeke okuninzi.
You say, yes.	Uthi, ewe.
Maybe this is happening to both of us.	Mhlawumbi oku kwenzeka kuthi sobabini.
Or that is the plan.	Okanye licebo elo.
I'm tired.	Ndidiniwe.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Kodwa ngaphambi kokuba uhambe, makhe ndikuxelele into.
Well, now you know.	Ewe, ngoku uyazi.
Good time, yes.	Ixesha elihle, ewe.
Please take a look now.	Nceda ujonge ngoku.
I live in town now.	Ndihlala edolophini ngoku.
None of us want to go through this.	Akukho namnye kuthi ofuna ukuhamba ngale nto.
To finish after that.	Ukugqiba emva koko.
I never went again.	Khange ndiphinde ndiye.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
In that case, no.	Xa kunjalo, hayi.
Everyone else will want you to leave.	Bonke abanye baya kufuna ukuba uhambe.
You want to do it that way, okay with me.	Ufuna ukwenza ngolo hlobo, kulungile nam.
And he did not want her to leave again.	Kwaye wayengafuni ukuba aphinde ahambe.
It can be difficult, can it?	Kunokuba nzima, akunjalo?
I would have.	Ndiza kufumana.
And this is his place.	Kwaye le ndawo yakhe.
I couldn't do it either.	Nam andikwazanga ukwenza.
I'm happy though.	Ndiyavuya kodwa.
I'm glad everyone is fine.	Ndiyavuya ukuba wonke umntu ulungile.
When he first arrived he did it well.	Ufike kuqala wayenza phantsi kakuhle.
There are many.	Kukho ezininzi.
I want to come here.	Ndifuna ukuza apha.
Not down as you are.	Hayi phantsi njengoko unjalo.
But this did not last very long.	Kodwa oku akuzange kube lixesha elide kakhulu.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlele.
He wanted a job.	Wayefuna umsebenzi.
If it is you.	Ukuba nguye wena.
I wonder what exactly this is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yintoni kanye kanye le nto.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
But that is not the answer.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo impendulo leyo.
We need to go further.	Kufuneka sihambe ngakumbi.
I'm going to have to do something.	Kuya kufuneka ndenze into.
I know a beautiful place.	Ndiyayazi indawo entle.
It's a long time.	Lixesha elide.
Location, place, place.	Indawo, indawo, indawo.
They will do well.	Baza kwenza kakuhle.
To me it is so.	Kum kunjalo.
And you, of course.	Nawe, kunjalo.
But really there was nothing.	Kodwa ngokwenene kwakungekho nto.
So look out.	Ngoko jonga phandle.
But now we know why.	Kodwa ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
He does it in an unusual way today.	Wenza ngendlela engaqhelekanga namhlanje.
Look back.	Jonga ngasemva.
Tomorrow, for sure, tomorrow.	Ngomso, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngomso.
But it is, probably.	Kodwa yinto, mhlawumbi.
He should go to prison.	Ufanele ukuya entolongweni.
I never thought about that at the time.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngaloo nto ngelo xesha.
You don't want anything to happen.	Awufuni kwenzeke nantoni na.
He made a lot of sense.	Wenza ingqondo kakhulu.
Sorry to say that.	Uxolo ukuthetha oko.
There is something very wrong with this.	Kukho into engalunganga kakhulu kule nto.
This requires a decision.	Oku kufuna isigqibo.
And now you're very tired, of course.	Kwaye ngoku udiniwe kakhulu, kunjalo.
Some did not.	Abanye abazange.
And just, you know.	Kwaye nje, uyazi.
You can be the first to know.	Unokuba ngowokuqala ukwazi.
It's too far to walk.	Kude kakhulu ukuhamba.
That would be a very big deal.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu kakhulu.
Really, it is.	Ngokwenene, kunjalo.
And now he did.	Kwaye ngoku wenza njalo.
I love it, though.	Ndiyayithanda, nangona kunjalo.
I told him there was no way.	Ndamxelela ukuba akukho ndlela.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho mntu.
I will definitely do that again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
That is why it is so difficult for us.	Yiyo loo nto kunzima kuthi.
He is no better.	Akakho ngcono.
I can do it if you want.	Ndingayenza ukuba uyafuna.
Is that true.	Ngaba yinyani leyo.
That will continue.	Oko kuya kuqhubeka.
I can't believe you think so.	Andikholelwa ukuba ucinga njalo.
Maybe me too.	Mhlawumbi nam.
Very people, that.	Abantu kakhulu, ukuba.
I can't really speak.	Andikwazi ngokwenene ukuthetha.
You, however, know better.	Wena, nangona kunjalo, wazi ngcono.
He is there for me.	Ukhona ngenxa yam.
There is a time to have children.	Kukho ixesha lokuba nabantwana.
It has to be fast, though.	Kufuneka kube ngokukhawuleza, nangona kunjalo.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
It is impossible to.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
Let me tell you this.	Makhe ndikuxelele oku.
This is how it is.	Kunjalo ke oku.
She will have to stop being a child, soon.	Kuya kufuneka ayeke ukuba ngumntwana, kungekudala.
Everything seemed fine.	Konke kwakubonakala kulungile.
And it's better.	Kwaye kungcono.
We want new music.	Sifuna umculo omtsha.
I will not wait any longer.	Andisayi kuphinda ndilinde.
However that goes for anything out there.	Nangona kunjalo oko kuya kuyo nantoni na ngaphandle.
I do not understand what this is.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni le.
My father never told me that.	Utata zange andixelele lonto.
He spoke, of course.	Wathetha, kunjalo.
If there are people.	Ukuba kukho abantu.
I have done wrong.	Ndenze kakubi.
He said 'maybe not'.	Wathi 'mhlawumbi hayi'.
Either way, he continued.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, waqhubeka.
I'm afraid there is only one.	Ndiyoyika kukho nje enye.
He did what he could.	Wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
Because that will happen.	Kuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
In the evening, if possible.	Ngokuhlwa, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Now, of course, he doesn't want to be that thing at the time.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akafuni ukuba yiloo nto ngelo xesha.
He looked at this and felt better.	Wajonga le nto waziva engcono.
He was often alone.	Wayedla ngokuba yedwa.
In my room.	Egumbini lam.
I wanted him to go with us.	Bendifuna ahambe nathi.
And you have to do it.	Kwaye kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
I ask this of you.	Ndicela lento kuwe.
It will be your job to make peace.	Iya kuba ngumsebenzi wakho ukwenza uxolo.
He does not want to come back.	Akafuni kubuya.
He told me everything.	Uye wandixelela yonke into.
I wanted you to know that it is okay to do that.	Bendifuna wazi ukuba kulungile ukwenza oko.
I have to see him.	Kufuneka ndimbone.
You do not know what is happening.	Awuyazi into eyenzekayo.
And we want one.	Kwaye sifuna enye.
But he is fine now.	Kodwa ulungile ngoku.
There is just a question about it.	Kukho nje umbuzo malunga nayo.
He just exists.	Ukhona nje.
And that's all, you know.	Kwaye yiyo yonke into, uyazi.
However, for sure.	Nangona kunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I knew how.	Ndandisazi ukuba njani.
So the question finally came to an end.	Ngoko lo mbuzo wafika ekugqibeleni.
Finally he spoke to me.	Ekugqibeleni wathetha nam.
All this.	Yonke le nto.
I don't want to talk about him.	Andifuni kuthetha ngaye.
But not some.	Kodwa hayi ezinye.
And here.	Kwaye apha.
Nice too meet you.	Ndiyavuya ukudibana nawe.
I don't have to read a lot of books.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndifunde iincwadi ezininzi.
He will return.	Uya kubuya.
He did not know what was happening now.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
I did not really want to go.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukuhamba.
You do not know what is out there.	Awuyazi into elapha phandle.
Her mother is here.	Umama wakhe ulapha.
Until the error occurs again.	De impazamo yenzeke kwakhona.
And I heard a voice.	Kwaye ndeva ilizwi.
I just want to make you think.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza ukuba ucinge.
Now I can walk again.	Ngoku ndiyakwazi ukuhamba kwakhona.
But it is very well done.	Kodwa yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu.
I'm not sure what that is, exactly.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni leyo, kanye.
You have to stay human.	Kufuneka uhlale ungumntu.
Finally, he returned to his house.	Ekugqibeleni, wabuyela endlwini yakhe.
So tell your friends.	Ke, xelela abahlobo bakho.
I know it's going to happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba iza kwenzeka.
I will go now.	Ndiza kuhamba ngoku.
We did not leave.	Khange sihambe.
I'm not sure what to do about it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto.
Reading or eating.	Ukufunda okanye ukutya.
I pretend I don't understand.	Ndenza ngathi andiqondi.
Or music.	Okanye umculo.
But he ran away anyway.	Kodwa wabaleka kunjalo.
Let me see it again.	Makhe ndibone kwakhona.
I'm really sorry about that.	Ndiyaxolisa nyani ngale nto.
And now we know what happened.	Ke ngoku siyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
It started to hurt.	Waqalisa ukuba buhlungu.
This is clearly not the case here.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
There is nothing inside and nothing outside.	Akukho nto ngaphakathi kwaye akukho nto ngaphandle.
You should be here soon.	Ufanele ukuba apha ngokukhawuleza.
You did better.	Wenze ngcono.
His voice.	Ilizwi lakhe.
And that's fine.	Kwaye kulungile.
He had to stop.	Kwafuneka ayeke.
You look good, like you slept once.	Ukhangeleka ulungile, ngathi ulele kube kanye.
Now we have to go and do it.	Ngoku kufuneka sihambe siye kuyenza.
So you're trying to get there and it's really hard.	Ngoko uzama ukufika apho kwaye kunzima ngokwenene.
Or a party.	Okanye itheko.
I don't know why he went that way.	Andazi ukuba kwakutheni ukuze aye ngolo hlobo.
I'm on time!	Ndifike ngexesha!
Where? ' 	Phi?'
There was no other way, really.	Kwakungekho enye indlela, ngokwenene.
If somebody might be sitting here, then.	Ukuba umntu unokuba uhleli apha, ngoko.
His name, his name.	Igama lakhe, igama lakhe.
It could be better.	Inokuba ngcono.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba ngumntwana.
Lunch at home.	Isidlo sasemini ekhaya.
He wanted to go slow.	Wayefuna ukuhamba kancinci.
You know that now.	Uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
For that, that's fine.	Kuba oko, kulungile.
He felt a little better that way.	Waziva engcono kancinci ngolo hlobo.
Almost here, sorry.	Phantse apha, uxolo.
And he really did that.	Kwaye wenze oko ngokwenene.
But he realized that he had made a mistake.	Kodwa waqonda ukuba wenze impazamo.
I did not go to school.	Khange ndiye esikolweni.
I hope you do though.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayenza nangona kunjalo.
I can't talk about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
I saw that he did not.	Ndabona ukuba akenzanga njalo.
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Bendicinga ukuba uthe ufuna ukunceda.
I'm not so sure about that either.	Andiqinisekanga kakhulu ngaloo nto kwaye.
It will definitely be a lot easier.	Ngenene kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
You want someone.	Ufuna umntu .
Or money.	Okanye imali.
It happened in the evening.	Kwenzeka ngokuhlwa.
You have to go to him.	Kufuneka uye kuye.
That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
One call.	Umnxeba omnye.
I know how much you love to shop.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthanda kangakanani ukuthenga.
He saw his gun.	Wabona umpu wakhe.
That would be a good thing.	Inokuba yinto elungileyo.
He wondered.	Wazibuza.
Sitting down.	Ukuhlala phantsi.
You can have time.	Unokuba nexesha.
Later, after that.	Kamva, emva koko.
You want to know why.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
I like that.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto.
Do you know when the meeting will be?	Ngaba uyazi ukuba iya kuba nini intlanganiso?
Any place will do.	Nayiphi na indawo iya kwenza.
Not exactly.	Hayi ncam.
He said he did not know the reason.	Wathi akasazi isizathu.
He said nothing.	Akazange athethe nto.
I will not be there.	Andiyi kuba lapho.
Now he was afraid.	Ngoku wayesoyika.
He travels a lot and stays away.	Uhamba kakhulu kwaye uhlala engekho.
I thought of you right away.	Ndacinga ngawe ngoko nangoko.
It would be a little painful.	Bekuya kuba buhlungu kancinci.
All of this will require money.	Konke oku kuya kufuna imali.
There is now one.	Kukho ngoku enye.
And not just me.	Kwaye hayi mna kuphela.
You will come, won't you?	Uya kuza, akunjalo?
It could be me.	Inokuba ndim.
Not my father.	Hayi utata wam.
Soon you will see anyone.	Kungekudala uza kubona ukuba nabani na.
Or talk to anyone.	Okanye uthethe nabani na.
Money, money, money!	Imali, imali, imali!
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
I can't make a decision.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
This is what it is now.	Yile nto ngoku.
She is my child.	Ngumntwana wam.
I wanted to know who did that.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba ngubani owenze loo nto.
It will take two hours to complete.	Kuya kuthatha iiyure ezimbini ukugqiba.
And everyone wanted to go to dinner.	Kwaye wonke umntu wayefuna ukuya kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
He did not want to talk to her right away.	Akazange afune ukuthetha naye ngoko nangoko.
Tell me more about that book.	Ndixelele ngakumbi ngaloo ncwadi.
Everyone thought it was great.	Wonke umntu wayecinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
All.	Yonke.
It is not easy to do otherwise.	Akukho lula ukwenza ngenye indlela.
My car is OK.	Imoto yam ilungile.
I heard about it in the morning.	Ndive ngayo ekuseni.
And you.	Kwaye wena.
And not now.	Kwaye hayi ngoku.
You do not have to do anything else.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze enye into.
This is nothing.	Oku akukho nto.
You know what you want !.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna!.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba ilungile.
He walks slowly at first.	Uhamba kancinci ekuqaleni.
When will they arrive?	Baza kufika nini?
I didn't say much.	Khange ndithethe kakhulu.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
When he arrived.	Xa efika.
Location	Indawo
But here it goes.	Kodwa apha kuhamba.
Could it be better.	Ngaba inokuba ngcono.
My mother knew, too, that one day this would happen.	Umama wayesazi, naye, ukuba ngenye imini oku kuya kwenzeka.
You will make friends.	Uya kwenza abahlobo.
Well, it's time again.	Kulungile, lixesha kwakhona.
I don't think it will be that hard.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba nzima ngolo hlobo.
It will be clearly seen.	Kuya kubonakala ngokucacileyo.
He sits up in bed and sleeps.	Uhlala ebhedini walala.
I don't have time for everyone.	Andinaxesha lakhe wonke umntu.
Not down.	Hayi phantsi.
Where would he go?	Wayeza kuya phi?
You've talked to him before.	Ukhe wathetha naye ngaphambili.
We went to each other.	Siye omnye komnye.
Then he got better.	Emva koko waba ngcono.
I'm sorry, very sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa, uxolo kakhulu.
Now one thing.	Ngoku into enye.
I'm not sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani oku.
So don't think.	Ngoko musa ukucinga.
We need to do this now.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto ngoku.
Say what you want to say.	Ukuthetha le nto ufuna ukuyithetha.
I can tell.	Ndiyakwazi ukuxelela.
He certainly had hope.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayenethemba.
That is your job, too.	Ngumsebenzi wakho lowo, nawe.
I would like that.	Ndingathanda oko.
I don't really remember.	Andikhumbuli ngokwenene.
That is my job, to make this easy for anyone to do.	Ngumsebenzi wam lowo, ukwenza oku kube lula ukuba nabani na akwazi ukuyenza.
You certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awuzange wenze njalo.
You will have plenty of time downstairs.	Uya kuba nexesha elininzi phantsi.
Well, I'm the one just talking.	Ewe, ndim lo uthetha nje.
Finally, that is exactly what happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka kanye loo nto.
And you think.	Kwaye ucinga.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
We will wait another few days.	Siza kulinda ezinye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Good job on that.	Umsebenzi omhle ngaloo nto.
We will take anyone.	Siza kuthatha nabani na.
In a bad way.	Ngendlela embi.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo.
Not fast enough.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
That is clear.	Oko kucacile.
But that's not my thing.	Kodwa asiyonto yam leyo.
You just want something else.	Ufuna nje enye into.
Or what happens later.	Okanye kwenzeka ntoni kamva.
Side, side.	Ecaleni, ecaleni.
It's none of my business.	Asiyonto yam.
There was no one at home.	Kwakungekho mntu ekhaya.
I don't want to do this all the time.	Andifuni kuyenza le nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
Good enough, obviously.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, ngokucacileyo.
Not her mother.	Hayi umama wakhe.
You've done this before, of course.	Wakhe wakwenza oku ngaphambili, kunjalo.
We'll start again.	Siza kuqala kwakhona.
You want to go do something else.	Ufuna ukuya kwenza enye into.
Don’t be too sad, though.	Musa ukuba buhlungu kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngoko nangoko.
All this together.	Konke oku kunye.
I don't want to be his friend.	Andifuni ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
I have never had a problem before.	Andizange ndibe nayo ingxaki ngaphambili.
You know, too.	Uyayazi, naye.
I just wanted to know where he was.	Bendifuna nje ukwazi ukuba uphi.
No, of course not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo namhlanje.
Then he looked around.	Emva koko wajonga kuloo ndawo.
Your problem will always be there.	Ingxaki yakho iya kuhlala.
He will do it, too.	Uya kukwenza, nawe.
He wants to go to it before.	Ufuna ukuya kuyo ngaphambili.
And so do we.	Kwaye nathi.
He tried hard.	Wazama ngamandla.
And you are better.	Kwaye ungcono.
I can't make it better.	Andikwazi ukuyenza ngcono.
Someone was coming.	Umntu wayeza kuza.
All right! 	Kulungile!
we will.	siya kwenza njalo.
You may be the first one.	Usenokuba ngowokuqala.
It's a really big deal.	Yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
You know this.	Uyayazi le nto.
Maybe it's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle.
And you can be.	Kwaye unokuba.
I have to be angry.	Ndifanele ukuba nomsindo.
Thus, he said.	Ngaloo ndlela, wathi.
It can be really hard.	Kunokuba nzima ngokwenene.
One or two.	Enye okanye ezimbini.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye leyo.
You do not have to think.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ucinge.
Everything is better in the end.	Konke kungcono ekugqibeleni.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
But what.	Kodwa yintoni na.
My message is too long.	Umyalezo wam mde kakhulu.
He wanted to leave.	Wayefuna ahambe.
But my mother made a number for me.	Kodwa umama wenze inombolo kum.
I've been down that way.	Ndibe phantsi ngaloo ndlela.
There is no tomorrow here.	Akukho ngomso apha.
So you don't go.	Ngoko awuyi.
I told you so.	Ndikuxelele njalo.
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
He's just one person.	Ungumntu nje omnye.
It makes it so much easier that way.	Kwenza kube lula kakhulu ngaloo ndlela.
I knew it was him.	Ndandisazi ukuba nguye.
You may have been here before.	Mhlawumbi ukhe waba apha ngaphambili.
He really isn't, of course.	Akanjalo ngokwenene, kunjalo.
I will go easy on you.	Ndiza kuhamba lula kuwe.
He works very hard.	Usebenza nzima kakhulu.
He tried to go to work, too.	Wazama ukuya emsebenzini, naye.
He didn't know there.	Wayengazi apho.
So much here.	Kakhulu apha.
He never spoke again.	Akazange aphinde athethe.
It would be so.	Bekuya kuba njalo.
I asked to sit down, and he agreed.	Ndacela ukuhlala phantsi, wavuma.
The accident happened last week.	Le ngozi yenzeke kwiveki ephelileyo.
How are you doing?	Uhamba njani ke?
Because there is nothing.	Ngenxa yokuba akukho nto.
You know you have it.	Uyazi ukuba unayo.
He is my friend.	Ngumhlobo wam.
This is not about that.	Oku akukho malunga naloo nto.
It could be any of us.	Inokuba nguye nabani na kuthi.
And how did you do it.	Kwaye wenze njani .
I have to have more time.	Ndifanele ndibe nexesha elininzi.
Your mother is fine.	Umama wakho ulungile.
He does it.	Uyayenza.
Finally, he spoke.	Ekugqibeleni, wathetha.
Of course it is here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo apha.
We did that.	Senze loo nto.
As you well know.	Njengoko uyazi kakuhle.
Money or whatever.	Imali okanye kunjalo.
All of that is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko yonke loo nto.
I don't know what he did.	Andazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
But there is one thing that everyone should know.	Kodwa kukho into enye wonke umntu ekufuneka uyazi.
I'll wait outside.	Ndiza kulinda ngaphandle.
He has spoken out loud.	Uye wathetha ngamandla.
No one expects this to happen.	Akukho mntu ulindele ukuba oku kwenzeke.
Not yet, though.	Hayi okwangoku, nangona kunjalo.
When you sit and wait somewhere.	Xa uhleli kwaye ulinde kwindawo ethile.
I don't remember that.	Andikhumbuli ngaloo nto.
Before he became.	Ngaphambi kokuba abe .
In it.	Kuyo.
So she did not tell anyone at first.	Ngoko akazange axelele mntu ekuqaleni.
He must have wanted to know.	Umele ukuba wayefuna ukwazi.
Good job on this.	Umsebenzi omhle ngale nto.
I apologize.	Ndiyaxolisa.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
Police at the time.	Amapolisa ngelo xesha.
Probably too much time, though.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elininzi kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
After that there was not much going on.	Emva koko kwakungekho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
Then move on.	Emva koko uye phambili.
I think something is wrong.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
Look at this book.	Jonga le ncwadi.
I did not want to.	Bendingafuni.
He thought nothing of it.	Akazange acinge nto.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Maybe he didn't know what it was.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
There and not there.	Apho kwaye akukho apho.
Look at your picture or picture.	Jonga umfanekiso okanye umfanekiso wakho.
Things about you.	Izinto ngawe.
She is really good.	Ulungile ngokwenene.
His only job.	Umsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
And you want something to do.	Kwaye ufuna into yokwenza.
But nobody did that.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakwenza oko.
Or he did.	Okanye uyenzile.
No, because.	Hayi, ngokuba.
He said he was interested.	Wathi unomdla.
You can do that.	Ungayenza loo nto.
Or not you now.	Okanye hayi wena ngoku.
I better do that.	Kungcono ndiyenze loo nto.
He kept telling the truth.	Waqhubeka ethetha inyaniso.
You know where you want to go.	Uyazi apho ufuna ukuya khona.
How much do you make.	Uyenza malini.
He said we would not do that.	Wathi asiyi kuyenza loo nto.
It’s hard to say which one is better.	Kunzima ukuthetha ukuba yeyiphi engcono.
He wanted his departure.	Wayefuna ukuhamba kwakhe.
And there is no need.	Kwaye akukho mfuneko.
It seems clear now that they are both.	Kubonakala kucacile ngoku ukuba bobabini.
Nice place and nice.	Indawo entle kwaye ilungile.
He didn't know how he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba uyazi njani.
I made a lot of money.	Ndenze imali eninzi.
People say that this is a good thing.	Abantu bathi yinto entle leyo.
Give me your coat.	Ndinike idyasi yakho.
Now we have to go.	Ngoku kufuneka sihambe.
No one says anything.	Akukho mntu uthetha nto.
Now, very much so.	Ngoku, kakhulu.
Then he asked me to leave.	Emva koko wandicela ukuba ndihambe.
No, no, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi, hayi.
I don't want you to be away from me.	Andifuni ukuba ube kude nam.
Me.	Mna.
If so, that's fine.	Ukuba kunjalo, kulungile.
It's good for you.	Ilungile kuwe.
I'm sure of it now.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo ngoku.
All his life he had been afraid.	Ubomi bakhe bonke wayesoyika.
A real place.	Indawo ngokwenene.
This is your doing.	Oku kukwenza kwakho.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe nto ingako.
No one is making you go.	Akukho mntu ukwenza ukuba uhambe.
Now my question.	Ngoku umbuzo wam.
Good job!	Umsebenzi omhle!
The picture stays with me.	Umfanekiso uhleli kum.
He got out of the car.	Wehla emotweni.
And he couldn't do it.	Kwaye khange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Not in his time.	Hayi ngexesha lakhe.
He wanted money.	Wayefuna imali.
Well, this seems fine.	Ewe, oku kubonakala kulungile.
This way please.	Le ndlela nceda.
I don’t know what it is ahead of time.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi into phambi kwexesha.
We should, of course.	Sifanele ukuba, kunjalo.
Not a girl.	Hayi intombi.
I'll get something else.	Ndiza kufumana enye into.
Everyone needs to talk to me.	Wonke umntu kufuneka athethe nam.
Other things to do.	Ezinye izinto ukwenza.
All right now.	Kulungile ngoku.
Then she would tell him that she loved him.	Emva koko wayeza kumxelela ukuba uyamthanda.
It's nothing.	Asiyonto.
And then one day it happened.	Kwaye ke ngenye imini kwenzeka.
You or anyone.	Wena okanye nabani na.
Once, and only once, are you here.	Kanye, kwaye kube kanye kuphela, ulapha.
Of course it is the other way around.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo ngenye indlela.
He stayed home all day.	Wahlala ekhaya imini yonke.
The truth is this.	Inyani yile nto.
I didn't want to tell you.	Bendingafuni ukukuxelela.
I certainly never did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange ndiyenze.
He's just trying to get her to do something.	Uzama nje ukwenza ukuba enze ntoni na.
I also know that it is good for her.	Ndiyazi nokuba ilungile kuye.
I'm not sure yet.	Andiqinisekanga okwangoku.
For me, more.	Kum, ngakumbi.
At first that seems like a good idea.	Ekuqaleni kubonakala ngathi licebo elihle elo.
When did you arrive at the same time?	Ufike nini kanye kanye?
She is looking after her children.	Ujonge abantwana bakhe.
That will be.	Oko kuya kuba .
I wish her doctor knew.	Akwaba ugqirha wakhe wayesazi.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange eze.
And so he could not.	Kwaye ke akazange akwazi.
So what do you think?	Ngoko ucinga ntoni?
But you have to stay here.	Kodwa kufuneka uhlale apha.
No one was really scared.	Akukho mntu wayesoyika ngokwenene.
I'll do that in the morning.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto kusasa.
No one came out.	Akukho mntu waphuma.
I feel confident about this.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
Who did this?	Ngubani owenze oku?
I do not know where.	Andazi apho.
If it is okay, people will buy it.	Ukuba kulungile, abantu baya kuthenga.
But he is.	Kodwa nguye.
He was not so much to her.	Wayengekho kangako kuye.
I never knew why.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
Yes even more now.	Ewe ngakumbi nangoku.
I do not like to talk.	Andikuthandi ukuthetha.
That's how bad it is.	Nantso indlela embi ngayo.
But there was nothing.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto.
And he told me I had to.	Kwaye wandixelela ukuba kufuneka.
Not really, no.	Hayi ngokwenene, hayi.
If nothing, nothing.	Ukuba akukho nto, akukho nto.
Yes you know.	Ewe uyazi.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
I do not understand why he is here.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni elapha.
He would succeed.	Wayeza kuphumelela.
He could not say anything else.	Akazange akwazi ukuthetha enye into.
Maybe so.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo.
I just have to tell you.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele nje.
This seems good to me.	Oku kubonakala kulungile kum.
Or I should have.	Okanye bekufanele ndenze.
I can't believe it.	Andikholelwa ukuba yiyo.
And you know what you look like.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba ukhangeleka njani.
So, don't think.	Ngoko, musa ukucinga.
You are lucky.	Unethamsanqa.
I know the answer.	Ndiyayazi impendulo.
He said he needed his help.	Wathi ufuna uncedo lwakhe.
And I never knew.	Kwaye andizange ndiyazi.
Not a good answer.	Hayi impendulo entle.
I know it will take a long time, yes.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuthatha ixesha elide, ewe.
He thought it was him.	Wayecinga ukuba nguye.
He loves the truth.	Uyayithanda inyaniso.
Everyone is beautiful.	Mhle wonke umntu.
He decided that it was time to do it.	Wagqiba kwelokuba kufuneka enjenjalo.
Even if you feel you have to.	Nokuba uziva kufuneka.
Don't think of anything.	Musa ukucinga nantoni na.
He would wait.	Wayeza kulinda.
I can't wait to play football.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukudlala ibhola.
Or whatever, really.	Okanye nantoni na, ngokwenene.
Do not take more	Musa ukuthatha ngaphezu
Then he ran away from home and returned to work.	Emva koko wabaleka endlwini wabuyela emsebenzini.
He told her to stop.	Wamxelela ukuba ayeke.
No need to be pretty, here.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba mhle, apha.
To this day it is so.	Kude kube namhlanje kunjalo.
Yes this is a bad thing to do to someone else.	Ewe le yinto engalunganga ukuyenza komnye umntu.
He can't do it.	Akanakuyenza loo nto.
Is that you? 	Ingaba nguwe?
asked the doctor.	wabuza ugqirha.
Old girl.	Intombi endala.
Yes, yes it is.	Ewe, ewe kunjalo.
What a strange thing.	Yintoni engaqhelekanga.
Well, maybe so.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Certainly not for me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kum.
I want to win.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela.
It’s easy on the outside, of course.	Kukho lula ngaphandle, kunjalo.
We will go.	Siza kuhamba.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
It should not be difficult.	Akufunekanga kube nzima.
I really tried.	Ndazama ngokwenene.
When this is not the case, it is not.	Xa oku akunjalo, akunjalo.
Not without his help.	Hayi ngaphandle koncedo lwakhe.
Tell me this.	Ndixelele oku.
Not me, but with him.	Hayi nam, kodwa kunye naye.
Not here.	Hayi apha.
Nobody about.	Akukho mntu malunga.
I mean that.	Ndithetha loo nto.
It seemed quick to get there.	Kwakubonakala ngokukhawuleza ukuya apho.
We want more money.	Sifuna imali eninzi.
It was not my letter.	Kwakungekho ileta yam.
He ate it.	Watya ngayo.
I have to go first.	Kufuneka ndiye kuqala.
To do that after.	Ukwenza oko emva kokuba.
They say everything is fine.	Bathi yonke into ilungile.
Nice to see you again.	Ndiyavuya ukubona kwakhona.
Did you have a good trip?	Uhambe kakuhle?
Well maybe now.	Kulungile mhlawumbi ngoku.
One way.	Enye indlela.
And one after that.	Kwaye enye emva koko.
Not my truth.	Hayi inyani yam.
I think it's good for anyone.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kuye nabani na.
It is difficult to know how you feel.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba uziva njani.
I was not hurt.	Andizange ndibe buhlungu.
But he always lives alone.	Kodwa uhlala uhlala yedwa.
And tomorrow.	Kwaye ngomso.
But one does not want to.	Kodwa umntu akafuni.
Don't you think we should go?	Awucingi ukuba sihambe?
He later died.	Kamva wafa.
And you already have it.	Kwaye sele unayo.
But you know it already.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba sele.
He has apologized.	Uye wacela uxolo.
You want to succeed.	Ufuna ukuphumelela.
And everyone else.	Kwaye bonke abanye.
But maybe there is another way to come.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela ezayo.
But he ran away.	Kodwa wabaleka wemka.
I didn’t know anyone did it until recently.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba umntu uyenzile kude kube mva nje.
Yes, that's me.	Ewe ndim lowo.
He did a good job.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle.
It just will be.	Kuya kuba nje.
But no, no.	Kodwa hayi, akukho.
You will have to look at everyone.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge wonke umntu.
He sat alone at the party.	Wahlala yedwa epatini.
You know very well.	Wazi kakhulu.
And the case.	Kwaye ityala.
There are two things, though.	Kukho izinto ezimbini, nangona kunjalo.
There was not much in that.	Kwakungekho nto ingako kuloo nto.
You will take up too much space.	Uya kuthatha indawo eninzi kakhulu.
So no one is going to do it.	Ngoko akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
She would like to know what happened to me.	Angathanda ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
But everything else, too.	Kodwa yonke enye into, nayo.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
No problem with that.	Akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
He needs to know.	Kufuneka azi.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
Now it is not.	Ngoku akunjalo.
He sat outside.	Wahlala phandle.
He certainly did not.	Ngenene akazange.
So it is with me.	Unjalo ke nam.
If you like staying here, fine and good.	Ukuba uthanda ukuhlala apha, kulungile kwaye kulungile.
But he stayed.	Kodwa wahlala.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
And you know, you do.	Kwaye uyazi, nawe.
Woman at this time.	Umfazi ngeli xesha.
I know now.	Ndiyazi ngoku.
You do not want to hurt yourself.	Awufuni ukwenza buhlungu.
I wanted this to happen.	Bendifuna ukuba kwenzeke lento.
Anyone can do it.	Nabani na angayenza.
Maybe you have too.	Mhlawumbi nawe unayo.
I will be here, whatever happens.	Ndiza kuba lapha, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
Then he made another one.	Emva koko wenza enye.
I talk to him almost every day.	Ndithetha naye phantse yonke imihla.
He wanted my place to stay.	Wayefuna indawo yam yokuhlala.
He lived there.	Wayehlala apho.
Nobody goes there.	Akukho mntu uya apho.
Last week nothing happened.	Kwiveki ephelileyo akukho nto yenzekileyo.
You told me you had been doing this for a long time.	Undixelele ukuba kudala uyenza le nto.
Maybe there is.	Mhlawumbi kukho.
I feel things.	Ndiziva izinto.
It seems to be everywhere now.	Kubonakala ngathi kuyo yonke indawo ngoku.
He promised to do his best.	Wathembisa ukwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I couldn’t, of course.	Andikwazanga, kunjalo.
So, it shouldn’t be a big deal.	Ngoko ke, akufanele kube yinto enkulu.
And now you.	Kwaye ngoku wena.
'work'.	' umsebenzi'.
And it should not be.	Kwaye akufanele kube njalo.
He will go.	Uya kuhamba.
She is very smart.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu.
But then something else.	Kodwa enye into ke.
Again, it is not.	Kwakhona, akunjalo.
So very, very good.	Ngoko kakhulu, kulungile kakhulu.
And every day he stayed longer.	Kwaye yonke imihla wahlala ixesha elide.
I live in the front.	Ndihlala ngaphambili.
You know, of course, they'll talk behind you.	Uyazi, ngokuqinisekileyo, baya kuthetha ngasemva kwakho.
Sorry.	Uxolo.
Like, very much so.	Njengokuba, kakhulu.
I can't wait to try that.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuzama oko.
I know nothing about you.	Andazi nto ngawe.
This may be good for you.	Oku kunokuba kulungile kuwe.
Please buy a book.	Nceda uthenge incwadi.
He came home alone.	Wafika eyedwa endlini.
I hope it will be so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kuba njalo.
And so it happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
However, it is better to do it.	Nangona kunjalo, kungcono ukuba wenze.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
He sat down quickly.	Wahlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
This is mine though.	Le yam kodwa.
And we didn't.	Kwaye asizange senze.
In place.	Kwindawo.
No one should do such a thing.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze into enje.
Just as difficult.	Kanye njengokuba nzima.
Unless you want to.	Ngaphandle kokuba uyafuna.
I just wanted to see.	Bendifuna nje ukubona.
His car, no.	Imoto yakhe, hayi.
He made peace.	Wenza uxolo.
But, of course, he had to leave.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, kwafuneka ahambe.
It's a good job.	Ngumsebenzi olungileyo.
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
And he did not do a very good job.	Kwaye akenzanga umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
Because we will all be here.	Kuba sonke siza kuba lapha.
No one had ever done this to him before.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza le nto kuye ngaphambili.
I didn't want to do it now.	Bendingafuni ukuyenza ngoku.
This creates a beautiful image.	Oku kwenza umfanekiso omhle.
Do you feel it now?	Ngaba uziva ngoku?
He'll only talk to me, for now.	Uya kuthetha nam kuphela, okwangoku.
It can be very difficult.	Inokuba nzima kakhulu.
life.	ubomi.
There is not much in it.	Akukho nto ingako kuyo.
I had to be.	Kwafuneka ndibe njalo.
I do not like swimming.	Andikuthandi ukuqubha.
I looked and looked everywhere, but nothing.	Ndijonge kwaye ndijonge yonke indawo, kodwa akukho nto.
All of this happened one day.	Konke oku kwenzeka ngenye imini.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
That means you are human.	Oko kuthetha ukuba ungumntu.
You are right too.	Nawe ulungile.
What are you trying to find.	Uzama ukufumana ntoni.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akukho nzima njengoko kubonakala.
I'm happy with it, for sure.	Ndiyavuya ngayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I'm going where we're going.	Ndiya apho siya khona.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akufanele kube njalo.
Lunch for me.	Isidlo sasemini kum.
He came in to us.	Wangena kuthi.
And again and again and again and again.	Kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
This he cannot do.	Le nto akanakuyenza.
I want to be in this.	Ndifuna ukuba kule nto.
And the place.	Kwaye indawo.
Or think you did.	Okanye ucinge ukuba wenze njalo.
He spoke less, so he spoke more.	Wayethetha kancinci, ngoko wathetha ngakumbi.
There is no way, no way.	Akukho ndlela, akukho ndlela.
He would come to her, at last.	Wayeza kuza kuye, ekugqibeleni.
And it did not.	Kwaye ayizange.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
My job is something that happens afterwards.	Umsebenzi wam yinto eyenzekayo emva koko.
Something else is happening here.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
But he managed.	Kodwa wakwazi.
I don't even care who he is.	Andikhathali nokuba nguye.
Really, there is nothing to it.	Ngokwenene, akukho nto kuyo.
Suddenly he had to tell.	Ngokukhawuleza kwafuneka axelele.
There is no one but me.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle kwam.
It is not just about money.	Akunjalo ngemali kuphela.
It just comes.	Iza nje.
Are you ok.	Ingaba ulungile.
That's the way it makes us real.	Yiloo ndlela esenza sibe yinyani.
He has finally come out.	Uye waphuma ekugqibeleni.
I'll see you tonight.	Ndiza kubona ngokuhlwanje.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi le.
So you have it.	Ngoko ke unayo.
It was not himself.	Yayingenguye ngokwakhe.
He started getting angry.	Waqalisa ukuba nomsindo.
You look forward to it.	Ulindele kakhulu.
How beautiful.	Njani na ukuba mhle.
However, the truth is, some will do it.	Nangona kunjalo, inyaniso kukuba, abanye baya kuyenza.
And you have it.	Kwaye unayo.
Nobody told me that.	Akukho mntu wandixelela loo nto.
And in this case.	Kwaye kule meko.
But before that, nothing.	Kodwa ngaphambi koko, akukho nto.
I hope you will succeed.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuphumelela.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo enje.
Finally, the answer.	Ekugqibeleni, impendulo.
You will get more ball.	Uya kufumana ibhola ngakumbi.
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nto.
Of course not everyone but that is not the case.	Ewe ayinguye wonke umntu kodwa ayisiyiyo loo nto.
Maybe someone else did.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu wenze njalo.
I thought a lot about that.	Ndacinga kakhulu ngaloo nto.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
Dad got a job.	UTata wafumana umsebenzi.
You have become a friend.	Ube ngumhlobo.
I'll take this.	Ndiza kuthatha oku.
I was looking for someone.	Bendifuna umntu.
All my friends will be able to come and stay.	Bonke abahlobo bam baza kukwazi ukuza kuhlala.
I like my coat.	Ndiyayithanda idyasi yam.
Then he could not walk.	Emva koko akazange akwazi ukuhamba.
But something happened.	Kodwa ke kukho into eyenzekayo.
Talking to him.	Ethetha naye.
Great.	Kakhulu.
That would be a good thing.	Inokuba yinto entle leyo.
Truth at last.	Inyaniso ekugqibeleni.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
We have to go there.	Kufuneka siye apho.
We will go before you.	Siza kuhamba phambi kwakho.
I want to be there very badly.	Ndifuna ukuba lapho kakubi kakhulu.
He stayed up all night.	Wahlala ubusuku bonke.
I hope you do too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
He really wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
Now there is none.	Ngoku akukho.
I'll talk to you about it.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngayo.
I am looking to buy a house.	Ndijonge ukuthenga indlu.
He did this now.	Oku wakwenza ngoku.
It all happened so fast.	Konke kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
He entered a large house.	Wangena endlini enkulu.
It was nothing to me.	Kwakungekho nto kum.
He will come up with this.	Uya kuza ngale nto.
We need to be together again.	Kufuneka sibe kunye kwakhona.
Thank you so much for dinner.	Enkosi kakhulu ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
Finally he said.	Ekugqibeleni wathi.
I did not want to.	Ndandingafuni.
Again, you know.	Kwakhona, uyazi.
Very good inside me.	Kuhle kakhulu ngaphakathi kum.
You play hard.	Udlala ngamandla.
They will want something from me first.	Baza kufuna into kum kuqala.
It should not be hard to find.	Akufanele kube nzima ukufumana.
This is not the case.	Ayisiyiyo le nto.
It could be.	Inokuba njalo.
You do not have to do anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze nantoni na.
He was never old.	Akazange abe mdala.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi mna.
This was no better, however.	Oku kwakungekho ngcono, nangona kunjalo.
He did that there.	Wayenza loo nto apho.
This job could be even more for me at this point.	Lo msebenzi unokuba ngakumbi kum ngeli xesha.
But we are not going anywhere.	Kodwa asiyi ndawo.
It's hard to know where to look.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba ujonge phi.
But you never did.	Kodwa kubonakala ukuba awuzange wenze njalo.
They did not have to go anywhere so fast.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba baye ndawo ngokukhawuleza ngolo hlobo.
I actually made a plan to do it.	Ngenene ndenze icebo lokwenza.
He wishes he could.	Unqwenela nokuba.
I will find a better way.	Ndiza kufumana indlela elungileyo.
Probably no one knew.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wayesazi.
He opened it and entered.	Wavula wangena.
He will have to make his own decision.	Kuya kufuneka enze isigqibo sakhe.
In front of me and me.	Phambi kwam nam.
Clearly, it has.	Ngokucacileyo, kuye kwenzeka.
He needed a plan to do this.	Wayefuna icebo lokwenza oku.
Finally, something wonderful happened!	Ekugqibeleni, kukho into entle eyenzekayo!
He has been alone for a very long time.	Uhleli yedwa ixesha elide kakhulu.
And there is none.	Kwaye akukho.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka.
No thanks!	Hayi enkosi!
It won't take long to get to your place of residence.	Akuyi kuthatha ixesha elide ukufika kwindawo yakho yokuhlala.
We have never been here before.	Zange sibe lapha ngaphambili.
He hoped it would be him.	Wayenethemba lokuba nguye.
I think that's a good thing to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
There is no question about it.	Akukho mbuzo ngayo.
I can't wait to read that book.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukufunda loo ncwadi.
I'm not sure how you did that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyenzile njani loo nto.
He wanted something else, he wanted something else.	Wayefuna enye into, efuna enye into.
Yes, for a long time.	Ewe, ixesha elide.
One good question requires another good question.	Omnye umbuzo olungileyo ufuna omnye umbuzo olungileyo.
You read a lot.	Ufunda kakhulu.
Now we will do just that.	Ngoku siza kwenza njalo.
Thank you so much again.	Enkosi kakhulu kwakhona.
I should be fine.	Ndifanele ukuba kulungile.
Only this.	Kuphela oku.
You watch and wait.	Wena jonga kwaye ulinde.
You will do well.	Uya kwenza kakuhle.
That's what you do.	Yiyo loo nto uyenza.
He will do it.	Uya kwenza.
There for a long time.	Apho ixesha elide.
And no money, by the way.	Kwaye akukho mali, ngendlela.
I had to tell my dad.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele utata.
I try very hard.	Ndizama kakhulu.
Long ago now.	Kudala ngoku.
And stay that way for weeks.	Kwaye uhlale unjalo iiveki.
He told his truth.	Uthethe inyani yakhe.
If he will do anything good for you.	Ukuba uya kwenza nantoni na elungileyo kuwe.
I wanted to do better.	Ndandifuna ukwenza ngcono.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He lived there for some years.	Wahlala apho iminyaka ethile.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I can't win.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela.
Well, maybe at first.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ekuqaleni.
Maybe he didn't really want to know.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
We should have done better.	Bekufanele ukuba senze ngcono.
I just don't know what it is.	Andazi nje ukuba yintoni.
I could not work.	Andikwazanga ukusebenza.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akufanele kube njalo.
Is it possible to be late?	Ngaba ukuhamba ixesha kunokwenzeka?
One way or another.	Enye indlela okanye enye.
No one knows much about it.	Akukho mntu wazi kakhulu ngayo.
And a gun.	Kwaye umpu.
I have no idea what is going on here.	Andiqondi tu ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apha.
There was no place.	Kwakungekho ndawo.
And the only reason for that is so.	Kwaye isizathu kuphela sokuba kunjalo.
She had to tell him.	Kwafuneka amxelele.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna.
And then there you are.	Kwaye ke kukho wena.
You just want to work.	Ufuna nje ukusebenza.
So there are a lot of things.	Ngoko kukho izinto ezininzi.
I do this at home.	Ndenza oku ekhaya.
Well, there is work, too.	Ewe, kukho umsebenzi, kwakhona.
He finished everything.	Wagqiba yonke into.
You know it.	Uyayazi.
He lives in the city.	Uhlala edolophini.
He gave me life.	Wandinika ubomi.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
Not 'immediately.	Hayi' ngokukhawuleza.
And everywhere.	Kwaye yonke indawo.
I am human.	Ndingumntu.
Why he went with her, he didn't know.	Kwakutheni ukuze ahambe nayo, wayengazi.
He knows he is not alone.	Uyazi ukuba ayinguye yedwa.
Then everyone went his own way.	Emva koko wonke umntu wahamba indlela yakhe.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Yintoni, ukuba kukho into engalunganga?
I thought so, too.	Ndacinga njalo, nam.
There are people everywhere.	Kukho abantu kuyo yonke indawo.
Thanks again for the excellent work.	Enkosi kwakhona ngomsebenzi omhle.
Then he became angry.	Emva koko waba nomsindo.
They'll be back soon, though.	Baza kubuya kungekudala, nangona kunjalo.
To him, of course.	Kuye, kunjalo.
Not only when it is possible, it always is.	Akunjalo kuphela xa kunokwenzeka, kuhlala kunjalo.
And yet.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo.
I did a good job, too.	Ndenze umsebenzi omhle, nam.
That happens in this case.	Oko kwenzeka kule meko.
He knew something was wrong.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga.
Maybe we should all be like that.	Mhlawumbi sonke sifanele sibe njalo.
And something happened.	Kwaye kukho into eyenzekayo.
But this does not have to be.	Kodwa oku akufuneki kube njalo.
Now there is a problem.	Ngoku kukho ingxaki.
Doing my job.	Ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
Not up here.	Hayi apha phezulu.
That's what this place really is.	Yiloo nto le ndawo ngokwenene.
I'm just waiting for the time.	Ndilinde nje ixesha.
Now is not the time.	Ngoku akukho xesha.
I know what the truth is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni inyaniso.
You will get better, you will get better.	Uya kuba ngcono, uya kuba njalo.
Well, that wasn't hard.	Ewe, oko kwakungekho nzima.
I do not remember exactly.	Andikhumbuli ncam.
And not just here.	Kwaye hayi apha kuphela.
I have to do a little something.	Kufuneka ndenze into encinci.
Really great thing.	Into enkulu ngokwenene.
I was late for school.	Ndifike emva kwexesha esikolweni.
I just wanted to die.	Ndandifuna nje ukufa.
This does a good job.	Oku kwenza umsebenzi omhle.
And now or never.	Kwaye ngoku okanye zange.
I have to make a decision.	Kufuneka ndenze isigqibo.
I like that.	Ndiyayithanda lo nto.
Because he did not.	Kuba akazange.
But it is a thing.	Kodwa yinto.
And he does.	Kwaye uyayenza.
He certainly was not there before.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho ngaphambili.
There is just this.	Kukho nje oku.
Anyone can make a mistake.	Nabani na angayenza impazamo.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
He wants to do it again and again.	Ufuna ukuyenza kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
He tried to tell the truth but was unsuccessful.	Wazama ukuthetha inyaniso kodwa akazange aphumelele.
But if you make a mistake.	Kodwa ukuba wenze impazamo.
I never thought of it.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo.
I'm not going anywhere now.	Andiyi ndawo ngoku.
Where should we go today?	Kufuneka siye phi namhlanje?
He has finished the day.	Uye wagqiba imini.
Once.	Kanye.
We know how that happened.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
He went his way.	Wahamba ngendlela.
Certainly.	Ngokuqinisekileyo.
He never told the truth.	Zange athethe inyani.
Wrong error.	Impazamo engalunganga.
No one came in with him.	Kwakungekho mntu wangena naye.
As he did not want to talk.	Njengoko wayengafuni ukuthetha.
More than that enough.	Ngaphezu koko ngokwaneleyo.
He should not have done so.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba enze njalo.
But not now, not really.	Kodwa hayi ngoku, akunjalo.
Now, time is now.	Ngoku, ixesha ngoku.
Or, you know, just in time.	Okanye, uyazi, kwangethuba.
You can't decide which one.	Awukwazi ukwenza isigqibo malunga nokuba yeyiphi na.
Everyone wants a car today!	Wonke umntu ufuna imoto namhlanje!
One too much.	Enye eninzi kakhulu.
You will want to go.	Uya kufuna ukuhamba.
But then he started working.	Kodwa emva koko waqalisa ukusebenza.
Maybe if you read more.	Mhlawumbi ukuba ufunda ngakumbi.
I apologize for everything.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke into.
Give me your phone.	Ndinike ifowuni yakho.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
Also, he asked me to go and see who he was.	Kwakhona, wandicela ukuba ndiye kubona ukuba ngubani.
Look in the room.	Jonga egumbini.
He never talked about it.	Zange athethe ngayo.
Everyone is scared but you.	Wonke umntu woyika kodwa wena.
The way you do it.	Indlela owenza ngayo.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
There is no reason at all.	Akukho sizathu konke konke.
Yeah, nothing, really.	Ewe, akukho nto, ngokwenene.
He is the only doctor in the area.	Nguye yedwa ugqirha kule ndawo.
You know something is very wrong.	Uyazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga ncam.
I could not wait for it to finally happen.	Andikwazanga ukulinda ukuba ekugqibeleni yenzeke.
I think there is one thing.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into enye.
He too ran inside.	Naye wabaleka wangena.
Nothing always.	Akukho nto rhoqo.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho enye into apho.
Not today though.	Hayi namhlanje kodwa.
They didn't, obviously.	Abazange, ngokucacileyo.
It was nothing, really.	Kwakungekho nto, ngokwenene.
He would see a doctor that afternoon.	Wayeza kubona ugqirha ngaloo njikalanga.
Now he knew what it was.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
I know the doctor.	Ndiyamazi ugqirha.
Then he talked to me.	Emva koko wathetha nam.
I would love to do that again.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
He is the one who says yes and says no.	Nguye lo uthi ewe kwaye uthi hayi.
Don't be sad.	Musa ukuba buhlungu.
And maybe not.	Kwaye mhlawumbi khange kube njalo.
Yes, that makes it possible.	Ewe, oko kuyenza ukuba yenzeke.
So, what are you going to do tonight?	Ke, uza kwenza ntoni ngokuhlwanje?
This will cost money.	Oku kuya kufuna imali.
I know it well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle.
However, it probably is not.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokwenzeka ukuba akukho.
He doesn't want anyone, you know.	Akafuni nabani na, uyazi.
It’s absolutely everything.	Yinto yonke into ngokupheleleyo.
Shortly thereafter, he arrived.	Kungekudala emva koko, wafika.
That is a strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
He apologized for it.	Wacela uxolo ngayo.
No one took the money again.	Akukho mntu wathatha imali kwakhona.
I'm not saying something bad happened to him.	Andithi kukho into embi eyenzekileyo kuye.
asked the controversy.	wabuza utata.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi ncam.
Something or someone.	Into okanye umntu.
But that approach did not work.	Kodwa loo ndlela ayizange yenzeke.
That would be even more difficult.	Oko bekuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He will do a great job.	Uya kwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
I knew better.	Ndandisazi ngcono.
At the time tomorrow.	Ngexesha ngomso.
He did not know how he got there.	Wayengazi ukuba ufike njani apho.
But tell your mother.	Kodwa xelela umama wakho.
You can be a man later.	Unokuba yindoda kamva.
He took another.	Wathatha enye.
Unless he spoke.	Ngaphandle kokuba akazange athethe.
Because everyone knew where we were going, after all.	Kuba wonke umntu wayesazi apho siya khona, emva koko.
Fast, and fast, and fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, kwaye ngokukhawuleza, kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
I don't know why, myself.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, ngokwam.
And we will never.	Kwaye asiyi kuze.
I cannot think or speak clearly.	Andikwazi ukucinga okanye ukuthetha ngokucacileyo.
Just in the afternoon.	Emva kwemini nje.
He came just in time.	Weza kanye ngexesha.
I should not have said anything.	Bekungafanelanga ndithethe nto.
Everyone wants it all.	Wonke umntu ufuna yonke loo nto.
Or, really, anyone.	Okanye, ngokwenene, nabani na.
He would like to see if you are good.	Angathanda ukubona ukuba ulungile na.
He wanted to do everything.	Wayefuna ukwenza yonke into.
But in it !!.	Kodwa kuyo!!.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Very good for him.	Kuhle kakhulu kuye.
We will get everyone in this.	Siza kufumana wonke umntu kule nto.
It was not immediately.	Akuzange kube ngoko nangoko.
He is afraid of death.	Uyoyika ukufa.
I did not know where he lived at the time.	Ndandingazi ukuba uhlala phi ngelo xesha.
I did not stay here long.	Khange ndihlale ixesha elide apha.
But that's it.	Kodwa loo nto.
And that looks good.	Kwaye oko kubonakala kulungile.
I will do something about him.	Ndiza kwenza into ngaye.
I think that would be great.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
So, no problem.	Ngoko, akukho ngxaki.
I think we did.	Ndicinga ukuba senze njalo.
He said yes, and he went very well.	Wathi ewe, kwaye uhambe kakuhle kakhulu.
I just want to get out of here.	Ndifuna nje ukuphuma apha.
It was not easy to say that.	Kwakungekho lula ukuthetha oko.
He always comes after me.	Usoloko uza emva kwam.
Because he is good.	Kuba ulungile.
Traveling was not so difficult.	Ukuhamba kwakungekho nzima kakhulu.
I can only drive one car at a time.	Ndiyakwazi ukuqhuba imoto enye kuphela ngexesha.
They live everywhere.	Bahlala kuyo yonke indawo.
Look here.	Jonga apha.
It should have been now.	Bekufanele kube ngoku.
You have to tell him the truth, no matter what.	Kufuneka umxelele inyani, nokuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He probably did not know anyone there.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi mntu apho.
No, of course not.	Hayi, kunjalo.
Yes, it could be something that is going to happen.	Ewe, inokuba yinto eza kwenzeka.
But he decided to try something else.	Kodwa wagqiba kwelokuba azame enye into.
I'll get there a little bit.	Ndiza kufika apho kancinci.
I want to try that today.	Ndifuna ukuzama loo nto namhlanje.
He refused to say anything.	Akazange avume ukuthetha nantoni na.
I want you to know that.	Ndifuna uyazi loo nto.
But he has improved.	Kodwa uye wayenza ngcono.
Almost all of this never happened.	Phantse konke oku akuzange kwenzeke.
You know it won't be easy.	Uyazi ukuba akuyi kuba lula.
So stop doing great things with that.	Ngoko yeka ukwenza into enkulu ngaloo nto.
Only his mother.	Umama wakhe kuphela.
The same thing happens here, all the time.	Kwenzeka into efanayo apha, ngalo lonke ixesha.
He glanced at the room quickly.	Wajonga igumbi ngokukhawuleza.
This is possible, even though it will not be easy.	Oku kunokwenzeka, nokuba akuyi kuba lula.
I think this is it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo le.
I told him he wanted to go.	Ndamxelela ukuba uyafuna ukuhamba.
With him, obviously.	Naye, ngokucacileyo.
Well, not too much.	Kulungile, hayi kakhulu.
That's what you need to do.	Nantso ke into ekufuneka uyenzile.
That is exactly what you need to do.	Yiloo nto kanye ekufuneka uyenzile.
As many as possible.	Abaninzi kangangoko.
She is going to school.	Uza kuya esikolweni.
He spent many hours in his new job.	Wachitha iiyure ezininzi emsebenzini wakhe omtsha.
If you are telling the truth, we must go.	Ukuba uthetha inyani, kufuneka sihambe.
Only you.	Nguwe kuphela.
I have no time.	Andinaxesha.
But not here or now.	Kodwa hayi apha okanye ngoku.
It's just fine.	Ilungile kuphela.
Nobody ever did that.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza loo nto.
Then you have this thing.	Emva koko unayo le nto.
I am looking at my phone.	Ndijonge ifowuni yam.
It's a very new thing.	Yinto entsha kakhulu.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo nje.
And he spoke well.	Kwaye wayethetha kakuhle.
Some have certainly.	Abanye baye ngokuqinisekileyo.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
And probably never will.	Kwaye mhlawumbi soze.
He is really determined.	Uzimisele ngokwenene.
Then he ran back to the car.	Emva koko wabaleka wabuyela emotweni.
You have to tell the truth.	Kufuneka uthethe inyani.
A case where a debt is required.	Ityala apho kufuneka ityala.
But, you know?	Kodwa, uyazi?
Look, there's a new house.	Jonga, kukho indlu entsha.
I'm sure this is it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo le.
Yes, her father is there.	Ewe, utata wakhe ukhona.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akasayi kuba njalo.
He could not do so.	Akazange akwazi ukwenjenjalo.
We want to succeed.	Sifuna ukuphumelela.
If it seems, yes.	Ukuba kubonakala, ewe.
What you want.	Oko ufuna.
Why does everyone speak so fast?	Kutheni wonke umntu ethetha ngokukhawuleza?
I did not know any number.	Bendingayazi noba yeyiphi inombolo.
Our place is fine.	Indawo yethu ilungile.
I can't get out.	Andikwazi ukuphuma.
We will be back!	Siza kubuya!
Knowing that it will return.	Ukwazi ukuba kuya kubuya.
I told her the truth.	Ndamxelela inyani.
Maybe he will.	Mhlawumbi uya kwenza njalo.
He said he liked it very much.	Wathi uyayithanda kakhulu.
We are going to be tough. 	Siza kuba nzima. 
He cannot see things clearly.	Akakwazi ukubona izinto kakuhle.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
He decided to become her friend.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba hayi.
He wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna kunye naye.
It will be so here.	Kuya kuba njalo apha.
Lots of problem at first.	Ingxaki eninzi ekuqaleni.
She is scared.	Uye woyika.
I don't like that.	andiyithandi loo nto.
I have to do something.	Kufuneka ndenze into.
This will not be easy or pleasant.	Oku akuyi kuba lula okanye kube mnandi.
He hopes so.	Unethemba lokuba kunjalo.
I would like to buy a house.	Ndingathanda ukuthenga indlu.
What a fuck.	Yintoni loo nto.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba uyenza njani na.
I can't believe he ran away.	Andikholelwa ukuba wabaleka wemka.
And then and again.	Kwaye kwaye kwaye.
You're so smart, you know.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu, uyazi.
See books if you want to.	Jonga iincwadi ukuba ufuna njalo.
But no, you know, not always.	Kodwa hayi, uyazi, hayi rhoqo.
He looked at the doctor.	Wajonga ugqirha.
The police live here.	Amapolisa ahlala apha.
Or through him.	Okanye ngaye.
And so on and so forth.	Kwaye njalo njalo njalo.
You are the only one now.	Nguwe kuphela ngoku.
I want you to tell me everything.	Ndifuna undixelele yonke into.
You will get your money inside.	Uya kufumana imali yakho ngaphakathi.
You don't really have to do that.	Akufunekanga uyenze loo nto ngenene.
He is much taller than me.	Mde kakhulu kunam.
He knows he didn't.	Uyazi ukuba akenzanga.
But, for now.	Kodwa, okwangoku.
I told you what happened.	Ndikuxelele into eyenzekayo.
And it will always be so.	Kwaye kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
Not just you, but your daughter.	Hayi nje wena, kodwa intombi yakho.
He was optimistic, of course.	Wayenethemba, kunjalo.
If so, it is.	Ukuba kunjalo, kuba njalo.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
He should never tell me again.	Akufunekanga aphinde andixelele.
This is a strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga le.
But when you think about it, it's really big.	Kodwa xa ucinga ngayo, yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
Then look at me.	Ndijonge ke.
I wanted you.	Bendifuna wena.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
What happens, it happens.	Kwenzeka ntoni, kwenzeka.
Maybe he didn't know anything.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi nto.
So he went out that morning.	Waphuma ke ngaloo ntsasa.
You are just as good as you are.	Ulungile kanye njengokuba unjalo.
I don't know how, but he is.	Andazi ukuba njani, kodwa nguye.
He did just that.	Wenza ngaloo nto.
Too much trouble.	Ingxaki eninzi kakhulu.
But he is older.	Kodwa mdala.
I want my friends.	Ndifuna abahlobo bam.
Not that this makes it easy.	Akunjalo ukuba oku kwenza kube lula.
Well done!	Wenze kakuhle!
But he could not say that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyithetha loo nto.
At that moment he asked for help.	Ngelo xesha wacela uncedo.
Much more than that.	Kakhulu ngaphezu koko.
That is what happened in this case.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke kule meko.
But no one lives that way today.	Kodwa akukho mntu uhlala ngolo hlobo namhlanje.
It seemed clear now.	Kwakubonakala kucacile ngoku.
I'd better tell you myself.	Kungcono ndikuxelele ngokwam.
I want to say this, though.	Ndifuna ukuthetha oku, nangona kunjalo.
This is a big deal.	Yinto enkulu le.
You do not even have to talk to him.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba uthethe naye.
What are we going to do about this?	Siza kwenza ntoni ngale nto?
Do not rush.	Musa ukwenza ngokukhawuleza.
You have to go if you can.	Kufuneka uhambe ukuba uyakwazi.
You never did.	Awuzange wenze njalo.
He apologized and sat down.	Wacela uxolo wahlala phantsi.
I did not stay.	Khange ndihlale.
His voice, too, probably.	Ilizwi lakhe, naye, mhlawumbi.
You can be really good.	Unokuba ulungile ngenene.
Or he will do it.	Okanye uya kwenza kuyo.
He didn't say much to me.	Khange athethe kakhulu kum.
It was not there.	Kwakungekho apho.
He wanted one but thought better of it.	Wayefuna enye kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
There is such a place.	Kukho indawo enjalo.
One better way.	Enye indlela engcono.
But no one knew he had to do anything about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze nantoni na ngaloo nto.
After a while, the first person did it again.	Emva kwexesha, umntu wokuqala wayenza kwakhona.
I will get a new bike.	Ndiza kufumana ibhayisekile entsha.
And for a really long time.	Kwaye ixesha elide ngokwenene.
There are many questions.	Kukho imibuzo emininzi.
I wanted to be away from him.	Ndandifuna ukuba kude naye.
Presence to me.	Ukuba khona kum.
That's what everybody does here.	Nantso into eyenziwa ngumntu wonke apha.
They will take your money.	Baza kuthatha imali yakho.
No one told me it was like you.	Akukho mntu wandixelela ukuba njengawe.
But the meal.	Kodwa isidlo.
He knew why he had come.	Wayesazi isizathu sokuba eze.
He asked me for money.	Wandicela imali.
He went there.	Waya apho.
Maybe, something is wrong with me.	Mhlawumbi, kukho into engalunganga kum.
That is good for me.	Nto leyo ilungile ngam.
As it is, it is impossible.	Njengoko kunjalo, akunakwenzeka.
But everyone only knows his story.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyazi kuphela ibali lakhe.
It will be a thing.	Iya kuba yinto.
But tell me this.	Kodwa ndixelele oku.
I don't really want to know.	Andifuni nyani ukwazi.
He started talking.	Waqalisa ukuthetha.
No one really knows what happened.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
It will start soon.	Iza kuqala kungekudala.
I'm so sorry for him.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngaye.
Yes, almost anything.	Ewe, phantse nantoni na.
He will be here tomorrow.	Uza kube elapha ngomso.
That makes for good reading.	Oko kwenza ukufunda kakuhle.
You are only here this week.	Ulapha kuphela kule veki.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni na.
It’s pretty quick if you’re good at it.	Ilungile ngokukhawuleza ukuba ulungile.
Don't go too far.	Musa ukuya kude.
He loves her.	Uyamthanda.
I think there are a few things here.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho izinto ezimbalwa apha.
But the mind is.	Kodwa ingqondo yona.
He certainly would.	Ngokuqinisekileyo angathanda.
That's you.	Nguwe lowo.
Take a good look.	Jonga kakuhle.
He just told the truth.	Wathetha inyani nje.
He stayed there.	Wahlala apho.
But it has been the same way.	Kodwa uye waba ngendlela efanayo.
Give it to me at once.	Ndinike kanye kanye.
I'd like to say something here.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha into apha.
And his life.	Kwaye ubomi bakhe.
So he did.	Ngoko uyenzile.
Now he is ready to play.	Ngoku ukulungele ukudlala.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuphumelela.
You know what it will be like.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuba njani oko.
You look good, too.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle, nawe.
He left.	Wemka .
He will do nothing.	Akayi kwenza nto.
Not just this.	Hayi nje le.
I love this book.	Ndiyayithanda le ncwadi.
He did not speak for long.	Khange athethe ixesha elide.
He arrived here yesterday.	Ufike apha izolo.
Then give it to me.	Emva koko ndinike.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Uqinisekile ukuba uyafuna ukuyenza loo nto?
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
One more opportunity, maybe.	Ithuba elinye, mhlawumbi.
He hoped it would be so.	Wayenethemba lokuba iya kuba njalo.
I wanted to talk to him.	Bendifuna ukuthetha naye.
We have to do the work.	Kufuneka senze umsebenzi.
He did not know why he was doing such a thing.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni esenza into enje.
It will take a lot of time.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu.
He only wanted to go home.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya kuphela.
On the floor.	Phantsi.
We will not do it unless you are right.	Asiyi kuyenza ngaphandle kokuba ulungile.
He is too old for this job.	Mdala kakhulu ngalo msebenzi.
Don't think about it.	Musa ukucinga ngayo.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi le.
I want her to leave.	Ndifuna ahambe.
He once said.	Wakhe wathi.
But we have to go.	Kodwa kufuneka sihambe.
You do it well.	Uyenza kakuhle.
Now he knew why.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Now then.	Ngoku ke.
So it is with you.	Kunjalo kuwe.
And you want to stay three hours.	Kwaye ufuna ukuhlala iiyure ezintathu.
You will not have to look far.	Akuyi kufuneka ujonge kude.
His biggest mistake.	Impazamo yakhe enkulu.
Tell me, though.	Ndixelele, nangona kunjalo.
It just seems like you did it somewhere.	Kuphela kubonakala ngathi wenze enye indawo.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
So sooner or later they will find their way.	Ngoko kungekudala okanye kamva baya kufumana indlela.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
You know how it goes.	Uyazi ukuba kuhamba njani.
You have one.	Unayo enye.
I did not go.	Khange ndiye.
Maybe for now.	Mhlawumbi okwangoku.
Where would you like to meet?	Ungathanda ukudibana phi?
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
I think it could be me.	Ndiyacinga ukuba inokuba ngam.
You can really do it.	Ungayenza ngenene.
You won’t see anything strange about him, really.	Awuyi kubona nantoni na engaqhelekanga kuye, ngokwenene.
He said he wanted to talk.	Wathi ufuna ukuthetha.
Really, much better in every way.	Ngokwenene, ngcono kakhulu ngayo yonke indlela.
She is not as beautiful as she used to be.	Akakho mhle njengakuqala.
Just do it because.	Ukwenza nje kuba.
Or any other place.	Okanye nayiphi na enye indawo.
I'll tell him he shouldn't talk to me.	Ndiza kumxelela ukuba akufuneki athethe nam.
You don't have to do that.	Akufunekanga uyenze loo nto.
I don't think he knows either.	Andiqondi ukuba naye uyazi.
And he finished speaking.	Wagqiba ke ukuthetha.
You probably know about me.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ngam.
A long time ago, really.	Kudala, ngokwenene.
He looked, he looked.	Wajonga, wajonga.
They say we need help.	Bathi sifuna uncedo.
He knew her.	Wayesazi kuye.
But no one else.	Kodwa akakho omnye umntu.
I know it will be so.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
It should not be too difficult.	Akufuneki kube nzima kakhulu.
He never went to college.	Akazange aye ekholejini.
I didn't, of course.	Andizange, kunjalo.
He thought he would succeed.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kuphumelela.
It's great to work with him.	Kuhle kakhulu ukusebenza naye.
You know a lot of people.	Uyazi abaninzi abantu.
I don't remember what else.	Andikhumbuli yintoni enye.
No one deserves to buy this.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuthenga oku.
One of us had to leave.	Omnye wethu kwafuneka ahambe.
He went too far.	Waya kude kakhulu.
He hoped it would end soon.	Wayenethemba lokuba iza kuphela ngokukhawuleza.
Really good job.	Umsebenzi omhle ngenene.
He knew he had to leave immediately.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
He came home and slept.	Wafika ekhaya walala.
He did not want to leave the house.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma endlwini.
He wanted, yes.	Wayefuna, ewe.
There is no problem at all in this.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela kule nto.
I want money fast.	Ndifuna imali ngokukhawuleza.
He walked slowly.	Wahamba kancinci kancinci.
Now tell me more.	Ngoku ndixelele ngakumbi.
Look at me now.	Ndijonge ngoku.
He decided to tell the truth.	Wagqiba kwelokuba athethe inyani.
Well, obviously not for me.	Ewe, ngokucacileyo hayi kum.
Why is this so.	Kutheni le nto kunjalo.
And even higher.	Kwaye phezulu ngakumbi.
We need to be together.	Kufuneka sibe kunye.
But that is not necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko.
Please take a look!	Nceda ujonge!.
He certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba njalo.
You seem interested.	Ubonakala unomdla.
Not everything.	Hayi yonke into.
I have to sit down.	Kufuneka ndihlale phantsi.
You can do that place, if you like.	Ungayenza loo ndawo, ukuba uyathanda.
I will not go with you now.	Andisayi kuhamba nawe ngoku.
Or it will seem to us.	Okanye kuya kubonakala ngathi.
It is clear why.	Kucacile ukuba kutheni.
You will have it tomorrow.	Uzakuba nayo ngomso.
I got really tired.	Ndifike ndihambe nyani.
But we will talk.	Kodwa siza kuthetha.
Just your money, and that's it.	Imali yakho nje, kwaye yiloo nto.
He can't swim.	Akakwazi ukuqubha.
In the classroom.	Eklasini.
Maybe you want to sit down.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuhlala phantsi.
We will never go.	Soze sihambe.
It's hard to make money.	Kunzima ukwenza imali.
I would not do such a thing.	Andiyi kuyenza into enjalo.
Moreover, someone started talking.	Ngaphezu koko, omnye umntu waqalisa ukuthetha.
You want to know more.	Ufuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
It is better sooner than later.	Kungcono ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
In his room on the bed.	Egumbini lakhe ebhedini.
Not so much a big job.	Hayi kakhulu umsebenzi omkhulu.
I know everyone is telling you this, but it really has to happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ukuxelela oku, kodwa kufuneka yenzeke ngokwenene.
You have nothing out there.	Unayo nantoni na ngaphandle.
On and on.	Kuqhubeka kuqhubeka.
This is what needs your attention.	Yile nto efuna ingqalelo yakho.
He does it every day.	Uyenza yonke imihla.
Yeah, one thing really.	Ewe, into enye ngokwenene.
He'll come here a little bit.	Uza kuza apha kancinci.
Because you feel it.	Ngenxa yokuba uziva.
I'm sure it is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kunjalo.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
We will all be there.	Sonke siya kuba lapho.
After that, she sat down and began to read.	Emva koko, wahlala phantsi waza waqalisa ukufunda.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
I could not do this.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza le nto.
And it should.	Kwaye kufuneka.
He looked around the room.	Wajonga egumbini.
But there are other things.	Kodwa ke kukho ezinye izinto.
No, they said, he did a good job.	Hayi, bathi, wenza umsebenzi omhle.
He knows it too.	Naye uyayazi.
I'm sure it could be.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kunokuba njalo.
That is exactly what is happening in this situation.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kule meko.
He knew now what was going to happen.	Wayesazi ngoku ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
But still, he did.	Kodwa kunjalo, uyenzile.
His mother agreed.	Umama wakhe wavuma.
I don't know what the problem might be.	Andiqondi ukuba inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
Yeah, whatever that is.	Ewe, nokuba yintoni na loo nto.
Finally, to finish.	Ekugqibeleni, ukugqiba.
And if you know us, you know it.	Kwaye ukuba uyasazi, uyayazi loo nto.
This one is good, too.	Le ilungile, nayo.
Don't do it.	Musa ukuyenza.
My wife did everything.	Umfazi wam wenze yonke into.
I'll be back .	Ndiza kubuya .
It is impossible to make a decision.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza isigqibo.
I'm tired of being alone.	Ndidiniwe ukuba ndedwa.
He said nothing.	Zange athethe nto.
I tried to win for a long time.	Ndazama ukuphumelela ixesha elide.
Sounds like, thank you.	Kubonakala ngathi, enkosi.
Well, one has to do it a certain way.	Ewe, umntu kufuneka enze ngendlela ethile.
He did not appear for long.	Akazange abonakale ixesha elide.
He agreed to go.	Wavuma ukuhamba.
No!.	Hayi!.
It happens every day.	Kwenzeka yonke imihla.
Where are you.	Uphi.
Very, very old.	Kakhulu, mdala kakhulu.
Anyway, that's fine.	Nangona kunjalo, kulungile.
See how far he went.	Jonga ukuba wahamba kangakanani.
Do not forget to read the book.	Ungalibali ukufunda incwadi.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngenene.
I would love your feedback on that.	Ndingathanda impendulo yakho kuloo nto.
That may not be the case.	Oko kusenokwenzeka ukuba akukho.
But then.	Kodwa ke ngoko.
I had to study hard.	Kwafuneka ndifunde nzima.
This is not about me.	Oku akukho malunga nam.
However, this is not necessary.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akuyomfuneko.
You can do that here.	Ungayenza loo nto apha.
I don’t want to give up anything.	Andifuni ukuyeka nantoni na.
All that evening he did not speak.	Yonke loo ngokuhlwa akazange athethe.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
This means that.	Oku kuthetha ukuba.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
I could not.	khange ndikwazi.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
It's just a good thing to do.	Yinto nje elungileyo ukuyenza.
Okay we'll see.	Kulungile siza kubona.
Not new.	Hayi entsha.
That's the big thing.	Nantso ke into enkulu.
That's just the job.	Ngumsebenzi nje lowo.
Then my father did.	Emva koko utata wenza.
When you have time it is.	Xa unexesha kunjalo.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
Stop talking.	Yeka ukuthetha.
If he doesn't know, he won't know.	Ukuba akazi, akayi kukwazi.
I saw a doctor.	Ndibone ugqirha.
To go.	Ukuze sihambe.
This will not hurt.	Oku akuyi kuba buhlungu.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka rhoqo.
We haven't been here for so long.	Asizange sibe lapha ixesha elide kangako.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi kuyenza le nto.
You have to do everything.	Kufuneka wenze yonke into.
I don’t know how it happened though.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka njani nangona kunjalo.
I know how to do it.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza.
That is his plan.	Licebo lakhe elo.
Maybe, though, he doesn't know.	Mhlawumbi, nangona kunjalo, akazi.
And not just to him, but to me.	Kwaye hayi kuye kuphela, kodwa kum.
Even now and.	Nangoku kwaye.
If not, you stay there.	Ukuba akunjalo, uhlala apho.
I'm glad you like.	Ndiyavuya ungathanda.
I will not.	Andiyi.
That's fine.	Lonto ilungile.
Unless it is another time.	Ngaphandle kokuba elinye ixesha.
I try to do a little in the evening.	Ndizama ukwenza kancinci ngokuhlwa.
This has been very fun.	Oku kube mnandi kakhulu.
It seems to be difficult.	Ubonakala ukuba kunzima.
You do not have to think anything here.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ucinge nantoni na apha.
A good wife.	Umfazi olungileyo.
That's why you need to think about this.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka ucinge ngale nto.
He felt wrong.	Waziva engalunganga.
Very pretty.	Mhle kakhulu.
And everything will be better.	Kwaye yonke into iya kuba ngcono.
Are you talking about me? 	Ngaba uthetha ngam?
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	Kwaye uxelele wonke umntu ukuba enze ntoni kwaye enze njani.
What are you looking at ?.	Ujonge ntoni?.
I never knew that.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto.
Certainly not possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
Far up there.	Kude phaya phezulu.
Is that true?	Ngaba yinyani leyo?
Just like, really.	Kanye njengokuba, ngokwenene.
Nowhere to go.	Akukho ndawo apho iya khona.
I do not want her to leave.	Andifuni ahambe.
We are not going there.	Asiyi apho.
I know that place inside.	Ndiyayazi loo ndawo ngaphakathi.
I don't think anyone deserves it.	Andiqondi ukuba umntu ufanele.
It is very difficult to go this way.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba ngale ndlela.
Everything is fine, really.	Yonke into ilungile, ngenene.
He will have to make a decision.	Kuya kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I don't care what you think.	Andikhathali nokuba ucinga ntoni.
Or many other things.	Okanye ezinye izinto ezininzi.
There was no way right there.	Kwakungekho ndlela kanye apho.
But soon, because he knew what it was.	Kodwa kungekudala, kuba wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
We did the right thing.	Senze into elungileyo.
Not sooner or later.	Hayi kwangoko okanye emva kwexesha.
He needed time alone to think.	Wayefuna ixesha lokuba yedwa ukuze acinge.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi kwaphela leyo.
He is like all of us.	Ufana nathi sonke.
I could not buy a new car.	Andikwazanga ukuthenga imoto entsha.
So do i.	Nam.
Without you.	Ngaphandle kwakho.
But only if you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba ufuna.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.	ndijonge phambili ukubona kwakhona.
I do not want to go.	Andifuni ukuhamba.
That is how something new came about.	Yiloo ndlela into entsha eza ngayo.
He once told me about her.	Wakhe wandixelela ngaye.
But this would be nice.	Kodwa oku kuya kuba kuhle.
Ultimately, you will have to decide.	Ekugqibeleni bekuya kufuneka umntu enze isigqibo.
No one made my breakfast.	Akukho mntu wenze isidlo sam sakusasa.
That's your day.	Nantso imini yakho.
But that is not the problem now.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo ingxaki ngoku.
You have to be that way too.	Kufuneka ube njalo nawe.
Nice to meet you at last.	Ndiyavuya ukudibana nawe ekugqibeleni.
He never told me.	Zange andixelele.
I never did.	Zange ndiyenze.
It takes everyone.	Kuthatha wonke umntu.
The doctor asked many questions.	Ugqirha wabuza imibuzo emininzi.
He opened it himself.	Wavula ngokwakhe.
Absolutely!	Ngokuqinisekileyo!
Yeah, okay, then.	Ewe, kulungile, ngoko.
He went into his room.	Wangena egumbini lakhe.
He comes here often, to talk about it.	Uza apha rhoqo, ukuze athethe ngaye.
Now something new is happening.	Ngoku kukho into entsha eyenzekayo.
Then you will go.	Emva koko uya kuhamba.
He says he won't go.	Uthi akayi.
Man is good.	Umntu ulungile.
He knows but he does not know.	Uyazi kodwa akazi.
That would be painful.	Oko kuya kuba buhlungu.
There is no place for you here, you need to know that.	Akukho ndawo yakho apha, kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
Belong to.	Yeka.
He said it's better not to.	Wathi kungcono hayi.
There is truth in that.	Kukho inyaniso kuloo nto.
However, you will not do it.	Nangona kunjalo, awuyi kuyenza.
I have to do this.	Kufuneka ndiyenze le nto.
At that moment, she realized that she loved him.	Kanye ngelo xesha, waqonda ukuba uyamthanda.
We'll talk later.	Siza kuthetha kamva.
I'm sorry about you.	Ndiyaxolisa ngawe.
I thought about everything.	Ndicinge ngayo yonke into.
There is no problem with that.	Akukho ngxaki kuloo nto.
I don't want to talk about this.	Andifuni kuthetha ngale nto.
It's hard to read a story.	Kunzima ukufunda ibali.
I know you are.	Ndiyazi ukuba unjalo.
No one died at that time.	Akukho mntu wafa ngelo xesha.
It's been a long time.	Kudala ixesha elide.
But it is not that simple.	Kodwa akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
You are very similar.	Ufana kakhulu.
He tried to think of something to do.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba enze ntoni.
Not in this case.	Hayi kule nto.
He could not control himself. 	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba. 
One is right.	Enye ilungile.
You told me something.	Undixelele into.
He left work early.	Wemka kwangethuba emsebenzini.
Some say no.	Abanye bathi hayi.
You probably know.	Mhlawumbi uyazi.
Really, really fast.	Ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
Where we need to go.	Apho kufuneka siye khona.
And he died.	Kwaye wafa.
Coming forward.	Ukuza ngaphambili.
I think you will be able to do it again.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kukwazi kwakhona.
Whatever happens.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo.
My mother came and sat down.	Wafika umama wahlala phantsi.
No food for two days.	Akukho kutya iintsuku ezimbini.
He could not finish his breakfast.	Akazange akwazi ukugqiba isidlo sakhe sakusasa.
No they didn't.	Hayi abazange.
The same thing happens today.	Kwenzeka into efanayo namhlanje.
I had to learn to do that.	Kwafuneka ndifunde ukwenza oko.
But, it is not.	Kodwa, akunjalo.
It seemed okay.	Kwakubonakala kulungile.
There it is!	Nantso ke!
He wants to talk.	Ufuna ukuthetha.
He told me that.	Wandixelela ukuba.
My mother wanted to know everything.	Umama wayefuna ukwazi yonke into.
They will wait for that.	Baza kulinda kanye oko.
We need your help.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho.
But where you go.	Kodwa apho uya khona.
He has to leave immediately.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
But he felt it.	Kodwa waziva.
Why is that so?	Kutheni kunjalo nje?
Not too fun.	Akukho mnandi kakhulu.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
But that is a good thing.	Kodwa yinto entle leyo.
You eat every day.	Utya yonke imihla.
You may be here now.	Inokuba ukhona ngoku.
Today, it is.	Namhlanje, kunjalo.
That morning then, and this morning now.	Ngaloo ntsasa ngoko, kwaye ngale ntsasa ngoku.
Not very well.	Hayi kakuhle.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
He has done it now.	Uyenzile ke ngoku.
That did not happen overnight.	Loo nto ayizange yenzeke ngoko nangoko.
Time.	Ixesha.
But only time.	Kodwa kuphela ixesha.
One day he died.	Ngenye imini wafa.
He lives alone here.	Uhlala wedwa apha.
Have they.	Ngaba baye.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele.
He did not tell anyone.	Akazange axelele mntu.
Maybe you will.	Mhlawumbi uya kukwazi.
Now, he knew.	Ngoku, wayesazi.
I'm glad you're fine.	Ndiyavuya ukuba ulungile.
Maybe yes, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi ewe, mhlawumbi hayi.
I want to get out of here.	Ndifuna ukuphuma apha.
I'm not sure what happened to you.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
No, he had to stay.	Hayi, kwafuneka ahlale.
I definitely need help in that area !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna uncedo kuloo ndawo!.
Or something like that, of course.	Okanye into enjalo, kunjalo.
Now it's your turn to do another.	Ngoku lixesha lakho lokuba wenze enye.
Maybe this will go well later.	Mhlawumbi oku kuya kuqhubeka kakuhle emva koko.
He would never know.	Akanakuze azi.
Not too long ago.	Kungekudala kakhulu.
Now it can be anyone.	Ngoku inokuba nabani na.
We'll see what happens to me.	Siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
You have to stay.	Kufuneka uhlale.
One of them.	Omnye waba.
There was no question about that, of course.	Kwakungekho mbuzo malunga naloo nto, kunjalo.
Just again.	Kwakhona nje.
We'll see something like this.	Siza kubona into enje.
I will eat anything.	Ndiza kutya nantoni na.
Now he looked down.	Ngoku wajonga phantsi.
If you need help.	Ukuba ufuna uncedo.
I'm not sure what else you need to do here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni enye ekufuneka uyenzile apha.
Her son was angry.	Unyana wakhe waba nomsindo.
Getting out of bed.	Ukuphuma ebhedini.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi ukuthetha.
I do, as it happens.	Ndenza, njengoko kwenzeka.
When he got home, he found his wife in bed.	Ukufika kwakhe ekhaya, wafumana umfazi wakhe ebhedini.
No one is more interested in his work.	Akukho mntu unomdla ngakumbi ngomsebenzi wakhe.
He will have to make a decision soon.	Kuya kufuneka enze isigqibo kungekudala.
He lived alone.	Wayehlala yedwa.
He does it every day, and everything, the better.	Wenza yonke imihla, kwaye yonke into, ngcono.
I really tried to think of it.	Ndazama ngokwenene ukucinga ngayo.
You have time.	Unexesha.
You will need help.	Uya kufuna uncedo.
I thought as much as I could.	Ndacinga kangangoko.
He heard something outside.	Weva into phandle.
It would be great.	Kunokuba kuhle.
I can't tell you anything else.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela enye into.
You feel good all week.	Uziva ulungile iveki yonke.
Sitting on the side.	Ukuhlala ecaleni.
Needless to say, he left immediately.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuthetha, wemka ngoko nangoko.
I would like to know what you think of it.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni ngayo.
I'm really going to it.	Ndiya kuyo ngokwenene.
One knew why, of course.	Omnye wayesazi ukuba kutheni, kunjalo.
That's just right.	Yinyani nje leyo.
I was supposed to be something.	Bekufanele ndibe yinto.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
I'm trying to finish this book.	Ndizama ukugqiba le ncwadi.
I actually went to school.	Nyani ndaya esikolweni.
I will definitely do it again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona.
What a problem no.	Yintoni ingxaki akukho.
Probably not time or place.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha okanye indawo.
So we're going to do something very big.	Ke siza kwenza into enkulu kakhulu.
I know you have it.	Ndiyazi ukuba unayo.
We have all done a great job with it.	Sonke senze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngayo.
But if you do not know if you are doing well.	Kodwa ukuba awuyazi ukuba wenza kakuhle.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
To have it.	Yokuba nayo.
Life or death.	Ubomi okanye ukufa.
Thank you thank you thank you.	Enkosi enkosi enkosi.
I've told you that before.	Ndikuxelele lonto ngaphambili.
He went to the restaurant.	Waya kwindawo yokutyela.
By his power.	Ngamandla akhe.
He said it would take a lot of time.	Uthe iza kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
This can be painful.	Oku kunokuba buhlungu.
When do you want this?	Ufuna nini lento?
He never told me about it.	Zange andixelele ngayo.
Some will take longer.	Abanye baya kuthatha ixesha elide.
And one day, he does.	Kwaye ngenye imini, uyayenza.
You probably know that.	Mhlawumbi uyayazi loo nto.
But man.	Kodwa umntu.
So far this is clearly the case.	Okwangoku oku kucacile ukuba kunjalo.
You will see.	Uza kubona.
What did he want, he wondered.	Wayefuna ntoni, wazibuza.
This time however.	Ngeli xesha kodwa.
It will be fun to help someone.	Kuya kuba mnandi ukunceda umntu.
I will not go to him.	Andiyi kuye.
I can't take any now.	Andikwazi ukuthatha nayiphi ngoku.
Up.	Phezulu.
You need to talk when you talk to him.	Kufuneka uthethe xa uthetha naye.
I '.	Mna'.
You may have done it the other way.	Usenokuba wenza ngenye indlela.
Just sitting outside.	Ukuhlala nje ngaphandle.
This takes time.	Oku kuthatha ixesha.
And no one knows why.	Kwaye akukho mntu uyazi ukuba kutheni.
I do not remember much, to be honest.	Andikhumbuli kakhulu, xa ndithetha inyani.
Tall and beautiful.	Mde kwaye mhle.
Or maybe it's you.	Okanye mhlawumbi nguwe.
No sorry, nothing.	Hayi uxolo, akukho nto.
Yeah, that way.	Ewe, ngolo hlobo.
So he does.	Ngoko uyayenza.
It can be fun.	Kunokuba mnandi.
One has to do so.	Umntu kufuneka enze njalo.
At first you don't even know what happened.	Ekuqaleni awuyazi nokuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I'm going to have to think about it.	Kuza kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
I hope not, because he speaks well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo, kuba uthetha kakuhle.
If you like it, fine.	Ukuba uyayithanda, kuhle.
I didn't know you could do this.	Bendingazi ukuba ungayenza lento.
One was long ago.	Omnye wayesele kudala.
We want you here.	Sifuna wena apha.
Everyone is doing something.	Wonke umntu wenza into ethile.
You have done this all your life.	Uyenze le nto ubomi bakho bonke.
Before that, he did not know.	Ngaphambi koko, wayengazi.
I was just thinking about doing the same thing.	Ndandicinga nje ngokwenza into efanayo.
He is not a good man at all.	Akangomntu olungileyo.
But now, no.	Kodwa ngoku, hayi.
To me there is nothing.	Kum akukho nto.
But he has to come in.	Kodwa kufuneka angene.
He wants to meet her.	Ufuna ukudibana naye.
I can't speak for long.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ixesha elide.
There is certainly no reason.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho sizathu.
That is your only job.	Ngumsebenzi wakho omnye lowo.
I want you to talk to us.	Ndifuna uthetha nathi.
So he did not seem to know his name.	Ngoko kubonakala ukuba wayengazi ukuba ngubani igama lakhe.
He knew, too.	Wayesazi, naye.
He started talking but did not.	Waqalisa ukuthetha kodwa akazange.
Just one word.	Ilizwi elinye nje .
I do not want to stay here.	Andifuni kuhlala apha.
He asked about you.	Wabuza ngawe.
This would be great.	Oku bekuya kuba kuhle.
He does things.	Wenza izinto.
Are you with me ?.	Ukhona nam?.
I do not want to talk to you.	Andifuni kuthetha nawe.
Just before you get there.	Ngaphambi nje kokuba ufike apho.
Some, not so much.	Abanye, hayi kakhulu.
So for now.	Ngoko okwangoku.
It’s not easy, of course.	Akukho lula, kunjalo.
Not always.	Hayi ngalo lonke ixesha.
There is no way to do that.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oko.
She is too tall for her.	Mde kakhulu ngeminyaka yakhe.
It will take time.	Iza kuthatha ixesha.
Something to do immediately.	Into ekufuneka yenziwe kwangoko.
You know you want one.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna enye.
But he did not say much.	Kodwa akazange athethe kakhulu.
But this is not immediately the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
You live here, not here.	Uhlala apha, hayi apha.
Maybe, though, more.	Mhlawumbi, nokuba, ngakumbi.
She is very smart and very determined.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu kwaye uzimisele ngamandla.
Before any of us knew.	Ngaphambi kokuba nabani na wethu azi.
Otherwise there may not be much.	Ngaphandle koko kusenokwenzeka ukuba akukho nto ingako.
No, more than that.	Hayi, ngaphezu koko.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Kwakungekho nto apha, akukho nto.
There is a new one.	Kukho entsha.
And this can be painful.	Kwaye oku kunokuba buhlungu.
Well, nothing now.	Ewe, akukho nto ngoku.
We will do this.	Siza kuyenza le nto.
All that.	Konke ukuba.
I wanted to know what happened.	Bendifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
Now is the time to speak up.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba ndithethe.
In the car.	Emotweni.
You do, too.	Uyayenza, nawe.
This may be the case.	Oku kunokuba kunjalo.
No, he understood.	Akunjalo, waqonda.
This should not be the case.	Oku akufuneki kube njalo.
Now no problem.	Ngoku akukho ngxaki.
Don't do that again.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
I have no breakfast.	Andikho isidlo sakusasa.
Peace in his presence.	Uxolo phambi kwakhe.
Just a better place.	Indawo nje engcono.
What, what.	Yintoni, yintoni.
You should have gone with him.	Bekufanele uhambe naye.
I would like to know.	Ndinqwenela ukwazi.
That's awesome.	Oko kuhle kakhulu.
My father would never say such a thing.	Utata akanakuze athethe into enjalo.
I think we will.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kwenza njalo.
And he never thought.	Kwaye akazange acinge.
There is certainly no way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ndlela.
She is the only friend in the house.	Ngumhlobo kuphela endlini.
You know how to do that, a lot of things.	Uyayazi indlela yokwenza oko, izinto ezininzi.
That's why we have to go now.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka sihambe ngoku.
I feel tired just thinking about it.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe ndicinga nje ngayo.
Please, no.	Nceda, hayi.
You do not have to do anything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze nto.
It is difficult to think clearly.	Kunzima ukucinga ngokucacileyo.
This also looks good.	Oku kwakhona kubonakala kulungile.
Doing is my thing.	Ukwenza yinto yam.
You're going to have to be a kid, you know.	Kuya kufuneka ube ngumntwana, uyazi.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Kuza kuba nzima ixesha elide.
If at this time he was not there.	Ukuba mhlawumbi ngeli xesha wayengekho.
If you do, this will be for you.	Ukuba uyayenza, oku kuya kuwe.
She wanted to go with him.	Wayefuna ukuhamba naye.
I did not want to stay in the house.	Bendingafuni kuhlala endlini.
He too spoke.	Naye wayethetha.
Only there is something else.	Kuphela kukho enye into.
It did not last long.	Khange ahlale ixesha elide nyani.
You want something better.	Ufuna into engcono.
It happened one day.	Kwenzeka ngenye imini.
You do not have to leave.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhambe.
And we have to leave right away.	Kwaye kufuneka sihambe kwangoko.
Very good book.	Incwadi entle kakhulu.
I am here to help.	Ndilapha ukunceda.
Night with breakfast.	Ubusuku ngesidlo sakusasa.
There is something very wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga kakhulu.
He never spoke out again.	Zange aphinde athethe phandle.
I don't know, something else.	Andazi, enye into.
No one knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto.
It just happened that way.	Kwenzeka ngolo hlobo nje.
And your dog.	Kwaye inja yakho.
You've had it.	Ukhe waba nayo.
There is no reason for you to be angry.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ube nomsindo.
I live up there.	Ndihlala phaya phezulu.
I don't think anyone will do it.	Andiqondi ukuba nabani na uya kuyenza.
I just want one but.	Ndifuna nje enye kodwa.
He could not control himself.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
But he has to try.	Kodwa kufuneka azame.
Thank you very much, very much !.	Enkosi kakhulu, kakhulu!.
You do not have to travel alone.	Akufunekanga uhambe wedwa.
Don't just walk away.	Musa nje ukuhamba.
And he didn't know why.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
I know one thing, though.	Ndiyazi into enye, nangona kunjalo.
But if he only knew.	Kodwa ukuba wayesazi.
I couldn't decide what it was.	Andikwazanga ukugqiba ukuba yintoni.
He's just talking.	Uthetha nje.
you will do well.	uya kwenza kakuhle.
Maybe he should think again, but he won't.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka acinge kwakhona, kodwa akayi.
Or maybe earlier.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphambili.
That's about enough to say.	Oko malunga ngokwaneleyo uthe.
Is that one.	Ngaba enye leyo.
However, this is not the case this week.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo kule veki.
He needs to look better.	Kufuneka afune ngcono.
A week, maybe.	Iveki, mhlawumbi.
Look at the case and you will see why.	Jonga ityala kwaye uya kubona ukuba kutheni.
Not me, of course.	Hayi nam, kunjalo.
I'm afraid what will happen next, even if he doesn't.	Ndiyoyika ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko, nokuba akanjalo.
I just did it.	Ndiyenzile nje.
We want to do everything we can to help you succeed.	Sifuna ukwenza konke okusemandleni ukukunceda ukuba uphumelele.
He just walked into the house.	Wangena nje endlini.
I can’t wait to read what he thought of his time.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda oko wayecinga ngexesha lakhe.
Everyone loves her.	Wonke umntu uyamthanda.
I knew everything.	Ndandisazi yonke into.
I don't know how they are going to do that.	Andazi ukuba baza kuyenza njani loo nto.
Except for one.	Ngaphandle nje omnye.
You can do it perfectly, too.	Ungayenza ngokupheleleyo, nawe.
But he was afraid to say anything.	Kodwa wayesoyika ukuthetha nantoni na.
I never did this myself.	Andizange ndiyenze ngokwam oku.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.
But it is hard for him to be with us.	Kodwa kunzima kuye ukuba kunye nathi.
She went well.	Uhambe kakuhle.
This one looks strange to me.	Lo ukhangeleka ngendlela engaqhelekanga kum.
He does this.	Uyayenza lento.
He saw something.	Wabona into.
But this is the way it is.	Kodwa oku ngendlela.
It is such a thing again.	Yinto enjalo kwakhona.
Then dad.	Emva koko utata .
Wire in the park.	Waya epakini.
And certainly the other two.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ezinye ezimbini.
Of course, everything can be fine.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, yonke into inokuba kakuhle.
I'll have to look back on that.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge emva kuloo nto.
Not all the time a lot, but maybe enough.	Hayi lonke ixesha elininzi, kodwa mhlawumbi ngokwaneleyo.
One problem, of course.	Ingxaki enye, kunjalo.
I never did this again until recently.	Andizange ndiphinde ndiyenze le nto kude kube mva nje.
Do not try to talk.	Musa ukuzama ukuthetha.
This job is better.	Lo msebenzi ungcono.
But he knew he had to try.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka azame.
Back again and again and again and again.	Emva kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I did a good job.	Ndenze umsebenzi omhle.
And back down.	Kwaye emva phantsi.
No need, out here.	Akukho mfuneko, apha phandle.
Don't go.	Musa ukuhamba.
Now, he knew he would have to.	Ngoku, wayesazi ukuba kuya kufuneka.
It is not as easy as you think.	Akukho lula njengoko ucinga.
She went to the doctor.	Wahamba ugqirha.
I wanted to go too.	Nam bendifuna ukuya khona.
I got there.	Ndifike apho.
He really tried.	Wazama ngokwenene.
This will probably go a long way.	Oku mhlawumbi kuya kude kakhulu.
He tried to see.	Wazama ukubona.
Until recently.	Kude kube mva nje.
You want to tell her all about it.	Ufuna umxelele ngayo yonke lento.
Well done, you.	Wenze kakuhle, wena.
It could have been me this time.	Inokuba ndim ngeli xesha.
And he had to learn how.	Kwaye kwafuneka afunde ukuba njani.
Great mistake for me.	Impazamo enkulu kum.
I didn't want one.	Ndandingafuni enye.
But, you know, that's fine.	Kodwa, uyazi, oko kulungile.
Last month, but whatever.	Kwinyanga ephelileyo, kodwa nantoni na.
Yeah, not really, that's right.	Ewe, hayi kangako, kunjalo.
You know how.	Uyazi ukuba njani.
Do you expect to die today?	Ngaba ulindele ukufa namhlanje?
Almost but not exactly.	Phantse kodwa hayi ncam.
Look ahead.	Jonga phambili.
That should be the case.	Kumele kube njalo ke.
That's why we need you.	Yiyo loo nto sifuna wena.
He wasn't, of course.	Wayengekho, kunjalo.
He went out there.	Waphuma waya apho.
I live a long time.	Ndihlala ixesha elide.
How is the phone?	Ilungile njani ifowuni.
It will be fine once at night.	Kuya kuba kuhle kanye ebusuku.
He realized that he was serious.	Waqonda ukuba uzimisele.
You just need help.	Ufuna nje uncedo.
Here, again, two things happened.	Apha, kwakhona, kwenzeka izinto ezimbini.
He did not say anything at first.	Akazange athethe nto ekuqaleni.
This has never happened to me before.	Le nto ayizange yenzeke kum ngaphambili.
It's the same thing though.	Yinto enye kodwa.
And you want something like that.	Kwaye ufuna into enjalo.
Eventually they will succeed.	Ekugqibeleni baya kuphumelela.
If you will be with me that.	Ukuba uya kuba nam oko.
So for good.	Ngoko ukuze kube kuhle.
You should have done a lot of things.	Bekufanele ukuba wenze izinto ezininzi.
I'm waiting for a call.	Ndilinde umnxeba.
I didn’t look away, though.	Andizange ndijonge ecaleni, nangona kunjalo.
Well, it could be the same thing.	Ewe, inokuba yinto enye.
Not me, of course.	Hayi mna, kunjalo.
No no no.	Hayi hayi hayi.
Maybe he was afraid of dying.	Mhlawumbi wayesoyika ukufa.
Also wrong.	Kwakhona engalunganga.
What just happened.	Kwenzeka ntoni ukuba nje.
Help me, of course.	Ndincede, kunjalo.
I want more.	Ndifuna ngakumbi.
You have to do it, whatever it is.	Kufuneka uyenze, nokuba yintoni na.
I know this, you know this.	Ndiyakwazi oku, uyakwazi oku.
And now I am.	Kwaye ngoku mna.
He opened the door.	Wavula ucango.
He seemed absent.	Wayebonakala engekho.
It could be anyone.	Inokuba nguye nabani na.
A new person.	Umntu omtsha.
I just finished.	Ndagqiba nje.
He was very scared.	Wayesoyika kakhulu.
Clearly you have our attention.	Ngokucacileyo unayo ingqalelo yethu.
Then he understood.	Emva koko waqonda.
And again, if there is one.	Kwaye kwakhona, ukuba kukho enye.
I want you to shop inside.	Ndifuna uthenge ngaphakathi.
Of course, that is not always the case.	Ewe, akunjalo rhoqo.
Thank you for being a friend.	Enkosi ngokuba ngumhlobo.
I know where he went.	Ndiyamazi apho waya khona.
But do not think of that.	Kodwa musa ukucinga ngaloo nto.
I know that's true.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
That's a big deal here.	Nantso into enkulu apha.
I just want to be alone, today.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndedwa, namhlanje.
How are you feeling?	Uziva njani?
But not the cat.	Kodwa hayi ikati.
I wanted my daughter.	Bendifuna intombi yam.
I will never be again.	Soze ndiphinde ndibe.
As soon as possible now.	Ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka ngoku.
But we will find a way.	Kodwa siya kufumana indlela.
I did something wrong.	Ndenze into engalunganga.
They will both do a great job.	Bobabini baya kwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
I did something.	Ndenze into.
Anything else.	Enye into.
It is more difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima ngakumbi, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
No one is going anywhere.	Akukho mntu uya ndawo.
Probably nothing here.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto apha.
But nobody said anything.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayethetha nto.
Not here, obviously.	Hayi apha, ngokucacileyo.
Thanks again.	Enkosi kwakhona.
They sit down on it.	Bahlala phantsi kuyo.
He came and went.	Wafika wahamba.
No more.	Hayi kwakhona.
You must have heard.	Umele ukuba weva.
Maybe your place ?.	Mhlawumbi indawo yakho?.
However, it is not.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
Not far away.	Hayi kude.
No one told me how to do it.	Akukho mntu wandixelela ukuba ndenze njani.
Maybe it would.	Mhlawumbi bekuya kuba njalo.
I didn't want to know if he could do that.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi ukuba angayenza na loo nto.
Or talk about it.	Okanye ukuthetha ngayo.
I have to do one.	Kufuneka ndenze enye.
That never happened.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto.
We need to leave immediately.	Kufuneka sihambe kwangoko.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
You will have to do more.	Kuya kufuneka wenze ngakumbi.
And in this case, it really isn't.	Kwaye kule meko, akunjalo ngokwenene.
It is a good thing to do.	Yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
No, not today.	Hayi, hayi namhlanje.
There is no danger.	Akukho ngozi.
something unusual happened.	kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He promised to help.	Wathembisa ukunceda.
Yes! 	Ewe!
even so.	nangona kunjalo.
I wanted a plan.	Bendifuna icebo.
The problem is what happens next.	Ingxaki kukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
And children.	Kwaye abantwana.
This is very difficult for me.	Oku kunzima kakhulu kum.
Don't be hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kuwe.
You can't do it at home.	Awukwazi ukwenza ekhaya.
And now this.	Kwaye ngoku oku.
He got out of the car.	Uye waphuma emotweni.
We don't have to go anywhere today.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba siye ndawo namhlanje.
No, too far.	Hayi, kude kakhulu.
He died shortly thereafter.	Wafa kungekudala emva koko.
That will be your job.	Oko kuya kuba ngumsebenzi wakho.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
He never came into the room, of course.	Akazange angene egumbini, kunjalo.
My mother told me to do it.	UMama wathi mandiyenze loo nto.
He didn't think it was good enough.	Wayengacingi ukuba kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
Something is happening, something new.	Kukho into eyenzekayo, into entsha.
You may be here.	Usenokuba apha.
That will be.	Oko kuya kuba.
It was not real.	Kwakungekho nyani.
And with money.	Kwaye ngemali.
He speaks clearly and clearly.	Uthetha ngokucacileyo kwaye kakuhle.
He looked at his book.	Wajonga incwadi yakhe.
You like that.	Uyayithanda loo nto.
Then he looked up.	Emva koko wajonga phezulu.
It just seemed.	Kwakubonakala nje .
I have to think about that.	Ndifanele ukucinga ngaloo nto.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ungcono kungekudala.
He wanted to know what had happened.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Very, very well.	Kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
He didn't do much about it.	Akazange enze nto ingako ngayo.
I had to tell him.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele.
It just happens.	Kwenzeka nje.
There are so many things.	Kukho izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
There is only one food.	Kukho ukutya komnye kuphela.
Or life, it seems.	Okanye ubomi, kubonakala.
It would make today much easier.	Bekuya kwenza namhlanje kube lula kakhulu.
Nobody goes that far.	Akukho mntu uya kude kangako.
I just can't have this.	Andikwazi nje ukuba nayo le.
I did it early today.	Ndiyenze kwangoko namhlanje.
I just want the truth.	Ndifuna nje inyaniso.
I would like to do that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza njalo.
I'll have to look up.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge phezulu.
Very well done.	Yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu.
He did not tell.	Zange axelele.
I do not see anything.	Andiboni nto.
It always happens.	Kwenzeka njalo.
Give me money.	Ndinike imali.
And thank you! 	Kwaye enkosi!
You have a place to stay.	Unayo indawo yokuhlala.
You just want a little more.	Ufuna nje kancinci.
Although his wife.	Nangona umfazi wakhe.
Everything is fine at work.	Yonke into ilungile emsebenzini.
We will have children.	Siza kuba nabantwana.
You do not have to tell anyone.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uxelele mntu.
In it he says.	Kuyo uthi.
My wife does not want to.	Umfazi wam akafuni.
I thought this might be a small thing.	Ndacinga ukuba oku kunokuba yinto encinci kuphela.
But, then.	Kodwa, ngoko.
It makes my job a lot easier. 	Kwenza umsebenzi wam ube lula kakhulu. 
what.	nini.
However, that is all that is happening.	Nangona kunjalo, yiyo yonke into eyenzekayo.
This is exactly what is happening here.	Yile nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
He ate his lunch quickly.	Watya isidlo sakhe sasemini ngokukhawuleza.
It's nice, nice to be here.	Yinto entle, entle ukuba elapha.
Some not so much.	Abanye hayi kakhulu.
That's right.	Ilungile kanye.
I don't know what my problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yam.
I want to stay with you.	Ndifuna ukuhlala nawe.
I'm scared of all this.	Ndiyoyika yonke le nto.
Then something unusual happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
Thank you very, very much.	Enkosi kakhulu, kakhulu.
I know you're going to be angry.	Ndiyazi ukuba uzakuba nomsindo.
No noise, either.	Akukho nomsindo, kwakhona.
But it's the same thing.	Kodwa yinto efanayo.
He never told me the whole story.	Akazange andixelele lonke ibali.
Dad just loves to talk.	Utata uthanda nje ukuthetha.
We just have to do it.	Kufuneka senze nje.
I wanted to.	Bendifuna.
It's over.	Kwaphela.
It all ended for him.	Kwaphela konke kuye.
You are the person after all.	Ungumntu emva koko.
Or it seemed to us.	Okanye kwakubonakala ngathi.
People say it will be seen.	Abantu bathi kuya kubonakala.
In front of him.	Phambi kwakhe.
He feels bad for you.	Uziva kakubi ngawe.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Ndenza iimpazamo ezininzi.
I have never heard of this.	Andizange ndive nto ngale nto.
Not long ago.	Hayi kudala.
Not so in this case.	Akunjalo kule meko.
He knows he will never succeed.	Uyazi ukuba akanakuze aphumelele.
I was never quite able to do that.	Andizange ndikwazi ngokupheleleyo ukuyenza loo nto.
I know it will be hard to talk about.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima ukuthetha ngayo.
I don’t have to think it’s true.	Akufunekanga ndicinge ukuba yinyani.
I thought you were referring to someone else.	Bendicinga ukuba uthetha omnye umntu.
More mom.	Umama ngakumbi.
Great help is needed.	Kufuneka uncedo kakhulu.
He fell asleep last night.	Uye walala phezolo.
Today, it is not.	Namhlanje, akunjalo.
But he will not come for her sake.	Kodwa akayi kuza ngenxa yakhe.
He would talk to her later.	Wayeza kuthetha naye kamva.
Tell me what you think.	Ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Every woman wants.	Wonke umfazi ufuna.
I'm sure he is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba nguye.
Good question!	Umbuzo omhle!
He did not know anyone there.	Wayengazi mntu apho.
So, when are you going?	Ke, uza kuya nini?
All of this will take time.	Konke oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
And thank you again.	Kwaye enkosi kwakhona.
Now that you are here you have to stay.	Ngoku ulapha kufuneka uhlale.
His little girl.	Intombi yakhe encinci.
Whatever this is.	Nokuba yintoni le.
Someone has to do it.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze.
I think you came here for you.	Ndicinga ukuba uze apha ngenxa yakho.
You are only trying to help.	Uzama ukunceda kuphela.
He wanted to get out of there.	Wayefuna ukuphuma apho.
Of course,.	Kunjalo,.
But he did not know where he was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba uphi.
I want you to go with me.	Ndifuna uhamba nam.
And I know a lot about it.	Kwaye ndiyazi okuninzi ngayo.
Finally he ran to the bedroom.	Ekugqibeleni wabaleka waya kwigumbi lokulala.
Before the police arrived.	Phambi kokuba amapolisa afike.
I do not believe it will be so.	Andikholelwa ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
The thing is, it didn't.	Into kukuba, ayizange.
Someone else, though.	Omnye umntu, nangona kunjalo.
Too angry.	Ukuba nomsindo kakhulu.
It's a small thing.	Yinto encinci.
And whatever happens to it.	Kwaye nantoni na eyenzekayo kuyo.
Don't be angry.	Musa ukuba nomsindo.
We help you.	Siza kuwe.
I can't say that.	Andikwazi ukuyithetha loo nto.
Shortly thereafter.	Kungekudala emva koko.
I don't see anything else.	Andiboni enye into.
He did not want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
I knew he was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuza.
He thought.	Wayecinga.
I was just thinking.	Bendicinga nje.
Or you may have read the whole story.	Okanye wafunda ngokupheleleyo.
It is not possible to complete this task in time.	Akunakwenzeka ukugqiba lo msebenzi ngexesha.
But then he got a call.	Kodwa emva koko wafumana umnxeba.
There is certainly a 'good' and a 'bad' way to do anyway.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho indlela 'elungileyo' kunye 'engalunganga' yokwenza nangona kunjalo.
No one yet.	Akukho mntu okwangoku.
He was just thinking about it the other day.	Wayecinga ngayo ngenye imini nje.
He did not think that he was doing something strange.	Wayengacingi ukuba wenza into engaqhelekanga.
Well, well, you don't have to go.	Ewe, kulungile, akukho mfuneko yokuba uhambe.
With me.	Nabani na kum.
He really continued with her.	Waqhubeka naye nyani.
Yeah, right there.	Ewe, kanye apho.
I saw him at the party.	Ndimbone epatini.
My father did not speak.	Utata akazange athethe.
But this time, it won't be so easy.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, akuyi kuba lula kangako.
And the answer is nothing.	Kwaye impendulo akukho nto.
But that's good enough, you know.	Kodwa oko kulungile ngokwaneleyo, uyazi.
And he tried.	Kwaye wazama.
Tom works hard.	UTom usebenza nzima.
He spoke very, very well.	Wathetha kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
I'm waiting for your reply.	Ndilinde impendulo yakho.
There is nothing out there.	Akukho nto apha phandle.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Kwakubonakala ngathi licebo elihle ngelo xesha.
Just once again.	Kanye nje kwakhona.
There is more inside.	Kukho ngakumbi ngaphakathi.
I saw his eyes.	Ndabona amehlo akhe.
She was scared, so she told me everything.	Wayesoyika, ngoko wandixelela yonke into.
This will be unusual.	Oku kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
That's all.	Yile nto nje.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo asizange senze njalo.
But not then.	Kodwa hayi ngoko.
He finally said.	Wathi ekugqibeleni.
So enough, that's fine.	Ngoko ngokwaneleyo, kulungile.
He told me he was scared.	Wandixelela ukuba uyoyika.
Speaking is difficult.	Ukuthetha kunzima.
I think you know where it goes.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi apho iya khona.
He never said a word about it, to me.	Akazange athethe nto ngayo, kum.
I'm not really.	Andikho ngokwenene.
I do more than that.	Ndenza ngaphezu koko.
He gave his mother flowers.	Wanika umama wakhe iintyatyambo.
It will end.	Iza kuphela.
After that, he was alone.	Emva koko, waba yedwa.
He would get there.	Wayeza kufika apho.
He is your friend.	Ngumhlobo wakho.
It will come to me.	Iya kuza kum.
Lying down.	Ulele phantsi.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kwenzeka.
This comes to me.	Oku kufika kum.
You will have to do everything.	Kuya kufuneka wenze yonke into.
He did a great job.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
Are you tired.	Udiniwe.
And that is not the case.	Kwaye ayisiyiyo loo nto.
I think you should go with me.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uhambe nam.
But he did not know everything.	Kodwa wayengazi yonke into.
That's right, and it's not.	Kunjalo, kwaye akunjalo.
New.	Entsha.
But maybe not soon.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kungekudala.
He did the right thing.	Wenza into elungileyo.
But if that was the case, he would not give up.	Kodwa ukuba kunjalo, akazange ayeke.
He opened the door when he got there.	Wavula ucango xa efika apho.
Only this week !.	Kuphela kule veki!.
Some are not.	Abanye akunjalo.
That's how great it is.	Nantso indlela omkhulu ngayo.
It will all happen soon.	Konke kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
I have no place for this.	Andifuni ndawo kule nto.
Then do it again.	Emva koko uyenza kwakhona.
He works really hard.	Usebenza nzima ngokwenene.
Just a little.	Nje encinci.
This can be a bad thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto embi.
I never thought it would be that hard.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba nzima ngolo hlobo.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akukho nto yenzekileyo.
They stay in that for a long time.	Bahlala kuloo nto ixesha elide.
We know what happened next.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Everyone is talking about this.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngale nto.
It's not something you're in here for.	Asiyonto ulapha ngaphakathi.
He wanted her to say something, whatever it was.	Wayefuna ukuba athethe into, nokuba yintoni na.
He would never do such a thing.	Akanakuze enze into enjalo.
See reading.	Jonga ukufunda.
I've told you before.	Ndikuxelele ngaphambili.
I do it every day.	Ndiyenza yonke imihla.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
It was nothing, though.	Kwakungekho nto, nangona kunjalo.
I'm going ahead tonight.	Ndiya ngaphambili ngokuhlwanje.
You have to wear a hat with it, though.	Kufuneka unxibe umnqwazi ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
But the meeting did not take place.	Kodwa intlanganiso ayizange yenzeke.
His whole life before him.	Ubomi bakhe bonke phambi kwakhe.
Not here, not to him.	Hayi apha, hayi kuye.
He must do so.	Kufuneka enjenjalo.
There is peace.	Kukho uxolo.
In the end, he could not.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange akwazi.
He knew it wasn't for him.	Wayesazi ukuba kwakungekho ngaye.
But there is no reason.	Kodwa akukho sizathu.
Good for you.	Kuhle kuwe.
But he said nothing to her.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto kuye.
And he is still here.	Kwaye nangoku ulapha.
He arrived late, he knew.	Wafika emva kwexesha, wayesazi.
I don't want to do anything.	Andifuni kwenza nto.
I want to be very far tomorrow.	Ndifuna ukuba kude kakhulu ngomso.
There is no need to do things.	Akukho mfuneko yokwenza izinto.
There was nothing at all.	Kwakungekho nto kwaphela.
She speaks well and just wants to help.	Uthetha kakuhle kwaye ufuna nje ukunceda.
I had to look.	Kwafuneka ndijonge.
So far,	Kuze kube ngoku,
It comes to me.	Iza kum.
Sorry about that!.	Uxolo ngalo nto!.
I could not determine what the problem might be.	Khange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
This is not exactly the case.	Oku akunjalo ncam.
And just in time.	Kwaye kanye ngexesha.
I did not want this to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke oku.
Well, that's fine.	Ewe, ilungile loo nto.
Very nice thing.	Into entle kakhulu.
I did not know who she was.	Ndandingazi ukuba ngubani.
And it's good, too.	Kwaye kuhle, kwakhona.
For	Ngokuba
You have to be better.	Kufuneka ube ngcono.
Time travel.	Ukuhamba ngexesha.
At the moment.	Ngelo xesha.
Too many things.	Izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
Tomorrow will be better.	Ngomso kuya kuba kuhle.
Up high.	Phezulu phezulu.
Obviously you have that.	Kucacile ukuba unayo loo nto.
And he did better.	Kwaye wenza ngcono.
I don't really know how anyone does that.	Andazi nyani ukuba umntu uyenza njani lonto.
Anyone who has done this to me.	Nabani na owenze lento kum.
I don't think we will ever do that.	Andiqondi ukuba siya kuze senze njalo.
But we know why.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba kutheni.
He wanted to know what was happening.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He has to drive fast.	Kufuneka aqhube ngokukhawuleza.
He made a speech.	Wenza intetho.
He knew why he did this.	Wayesazi isizathu sokuba enze le nto.
Where is my phone?	Iphi ifowuni yam?
I tell the truth;	Ndithetha inyaniso;
It should be really nice though.	Kufuneka kube kuhle ngokwenene nangona.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela.
I heard about you.	Ndeva ngawe.
It seemed like a big deal.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
He asked to meet you.	Wacela ukudibana nawe.
You want to help but you can't.	Uyafuna ukunceda kodwa awukwazi.
Each time, he would be late.	Ngalo lonke ithuba, wayeza kufika emva kwexesha.
I have done a very good job.	Ndenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
I'll be back soon.	Ndiza kubuya ngokukhawuleza.
He did not know why he should say anything.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni kufuneka athethe nantoni na.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi.
And he had to tell somebody.	Kwaye kwafuneka axelele umntu.
How tall.	Mde kangakanani.
It will make it very difficult.	Kuya kwenza kube nzima kakhulu.
This is for him.	Oku kuye.
I do not want to see a doctor.	Andifuni kubona ugqirha.
He ate breakfast and went back to bed.	Watya isidlo sakusasa, wabuyela ebhedini.
He also knew.	Naye waziva.
Yes, two things.	Ewe, izinto ezimbini.
She has got a good job.	Uye wafumana umsebenzi omhle.
Tell me your problem.	Ndixelele ingxaki yakho.
He returned to the room.	Wabuyela egumbini.
If he wasn't.	Ukuba wayengekho.
What do you want to eat today?	Ufuna ukutya ntoni namhlanje?
He probably decided that.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wagqiba kwelokuba.
To say nothing.	Ukuthetha nto.
I left the other day.	Ndihambe ngenye imini.
Check this out.	Jonga le.
But there is a way to do this.	Kodwa kukho indlela yokwenza oku.
It should not happen.	Akufunekanga yenzeke.
Yeah, a little bit.	Ewe, kancinci.
He said yes.	Wathi ewe.
Waiting from tomorrow.	Ulinde ukusukela kusasa.
That is everyone.	Lowo ngumntu wonke.
And what is this? 	Kwaye yintoni le?
I was thinking about you.	Bendicinga ngawe.
We had to be.	Kwafuneka sibe .
And he never stopped.	Kwaye akazange ayeke.
I don't even know how.	Andazi nokuba njani.
I know you know about us.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi ngathi.
He loves everyone.	Uthanda wonke umntu.
No one knew where he lived.	Akukho mntu wayesazi apho ahlala khona.
I will never have such a thing.	Andiyi kuba nayo into enjalo.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enze njalo.
One right after another.	Omnye kanye emva komnye.
Do you know.	Ingaba uyazi.
You know.	Uyazi wena.
This way .	Le ndlela .
One never knows.	Umntu akanakuze azi.
If you did something wrong.	Ukuba wenze into embi.
But it's okay with me.	Kodwa kulungile nam.
You did the right thing.	Wenze into elungileyo.
He just isn't there.	Akakho nje.
He said that this was a good idea.	Wathi licebo elihle elo.
Slightly down.	Phantsi kancinci.
Everyone will wait.	Wonke umntu uya kulinda.
Tell me where you are.	Ndixelele ukuba uphi.
That is good work.	Ngumsebenzi omhle lowo.
He wants me to tell him.	Ufuna ndimxelele.
I will go.	Ndiya kuhamba.
That's what's going to happen.	Yiloo nto eza kwenzeka.
More deaths.	Ukufa okuninzi.
He had to go there.	Kwafuneka ahambe apho.
And the food will not be hard for long.	Kwaye ukutya akuyi kuba nzima ixesha elide.
Why.	Kutheni .
So it is very difficult to do.	Ngoko kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Coming soon.	Iza ngokukhawuleza.
Obviously something is wrong.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into engalunganga.
That's it for us.	Yiloo nto kuthi.
He said yes but no.	Wathi ewe kodwa hayi.
You've talked about it before.	Ukhe wathetha ngayo ngaphambili.
You can't walk.	Awukwazi ukuhamba.
He studied for many years.	Wafunda iminyaka emininzi.
I've been saying this for a long time.	Kudala ndithetha le nto.
The truth is no one knows.	Inyaniso akukho mntu uyazi.
We'll start small.	Siza kuqala kancinci.
You know you're here.	Uyazi ukuba ulapha.
He wanted to learn everything.	Wayefuna ukufunda yonke into.
There is nothing about that.	Akukho nto ngaloo nto.
Looks like you want one.	Kubonakala ngathi ufuna enye.
I can't stay away from him.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude naye.
But no one really knows, because it's a very new approach.	Kodwa akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene, kuba indlela entsha kakhulu.
Not too much and not too fast.	Hayi kakhulu kwaye hayi ngokukhawuleza.
Not now and not later.	Hayi ngoku kwaye hayi kamva.
I wanted to know everything about him.	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into ngaye.
This is very difficult to do.	Oku kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
He will not succeed!	Akayi kuphumelela!
He went to his office.	Waya eofisini yakhe.
He did very well, too.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu, naye.
That was not for us.	Oko kwakungekho kuthi.
Not hard.	Hayi nzima.
I don't think you want it that way, but it is.	Andiqondi ukuba ufuna ukuba njalo, kodwa kunjalo.
Playing together can be difficult.	Ukudlala kunye kunokuba nzima.
We need to do the right thing.	Kufuneka senze into elungileyo.
So he thought.	Ngoko wayecinga.
So maybe there is something in it.	Ngoko mhlawumbi kukho into kuyo.
Just now.	Ngoku.
We didn't have to do anything about it.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba senze nto ngayo.
He looked behind her.	Wajonga emva kwakhe.
And you're always trying to do that.	Kwaye usoloko uzama ukwenza oko.
Or so you think.	Okanye ucinga njalo.
Or more.	Okanye kakhulu.
He never thought about it.	Khange acinge ngayo.
With power.	Ngamandla.
I could not get enough.	Andikwazanga ukufumana ngokwaneleyo.
He speaks very fast.	Uthetha ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
You won't get to that, he thought.	Akuyi kufika kuloo nto, wacinga.
I can't speak more clearly.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokucacileyo ngakumbi.
I will make it happen.	Ndiya kuyenza yenzeke.
So neither will we.	Ngoko nathi asiyi kuyenza.
He is clearly happy.	Uyavuya ngokucacileyo.
But something is terribly wrong.	Kodwa kukho into engalunganga ncam.
He always goes there.	Uya rhoqo apho.
But it is not, it is.	Kodwa akunjalo, kunjalo.
You will be able to stay in it.	Uya kukwazi ukuhlala kuyo.
I don't know how you went.	Andazi ukuba uhambe njani.
It seemed he didn't.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akazange.
Maybe you will get help either.	Mhlawumbi uya kufumana uncedo okanye .
But don't just take our word for it.	Kodwa musa nje ukuthatha ilizwi lethu ngayo.
It would have been easier if it was me.	Bekuya kuba lula ukuba ndim.
Don't get angry about that.	Musa ukuba nomsindo ngaloo nto.
Just like anything.	Nje ukuba nantoni na.
There is no need to be angry.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba nomsindo.
He is not really in it.	Akakho kuyo ngokwenene.
He did not know where he wanted to go.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ukuya phi.
I mean everything.	Ndithetha yonke into.
Let me tell you a few things.	Makhe ndikuxelele izinto ezimbalwa.
No one has to leave.	Akukho mntu kufuneka ahambe.
He spoke in another way.	Wathetha ngenye indlela.
More than that regularly.	Ngaphezu koko rhoqo.
There is no new person.	Akukho mntu omtsha.
And at home,.	Kwaye ekhaya,.
Please stay with it.	Ndicela uhlale nayo.
Good.	Elungileyo.
No one has ever given me so much as you.	Akukho mntu wakha wandinika into eninzi njengawe.
I think there is one small problem.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho ingxaki enye encinci.
Yes of course.	Ewe, kunjalo.
That comes with being human.	Oko kuza nokuba ngumntu.
You are so much better.	Ungcono kakhulu.
Do not say or do anything.	Musa ukuthetha okanye wenze nantoni na.
I want to make that money.	Ndifuna ukwenza loo mali.
I did it outside.	Ndenze phandle.
I never knew you could do this.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza le nto.
As soon as possible.	Ngokukhawuleza.
Then he went down.	Emva koko wehla.
Long ago he died, now.	Kudala wafa, ngoku.
I will just say this.	Ndiza kuthetha nje oku.
I have to tell you something.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele into.
I knew him.	Ndandisazi kuye.
Why is he doing something like this.	Kutheni esenza into enje.
It's okay.	Ilungile.
If you can't think of something right away, that's fine.	Ukuba awukwazi ukucinga into ngoko nangoko, kulungile.
One person is good, another is not.	Umntu omnye ulungile, omnye akakho.
Nothing and no one.	Akukho nto kwaye akukho mntu.
I don't even know if one of us is ready for that.	Andazi nokuba omnye wethu ukulungele na oko.
Stop doing that.	Yeka ukwenza loo nto.
Obviously, he has done this before.	Ngokucacileyo, uye wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
Soon, please.	Kungekudala, nceda.
Everyone knows this is impossible.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
You feel tired.	Uziva udiniwe.
After that, he asked me to do it.	Emva koko, uye wandicela ukuba ndiyenze.
I knew you were talking about me.	Ndandisazi ukuba uthetha ngam.
They will be together, in the end.	Baza kuba kunye, ekugqibeleni.
What time is it now?	Ngubani ixesha ngoku?
Well, you know.	Kulungile, uyazi.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
She is very happy.	Uyavuya kakhulu.
Playing with him.	Ukudlala naye.
I have never done anything like this before.	Andizange ndenze into enje ngaphambili.
And that takes money.	Kwaye oko kuthatha imali.
There is no money there.	Akukho mali apho.
No one was talking.	Kwakungekho mntu uthetha.
And why you should !.	Kwaye kutheni ufanele!.
Check the truth, please !.	Jonga inyani, nceda!.
It's not just me.	Akukho ngam nje.
He will certainly do it again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uza kuphinda.
I was thinking about you this morning.	Bendicinga ngawe ngale ntsasa.
We'll talk about that later.	Siza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
And then there is the truth.	Kwaye ke kukho inyaniso.
He stepped back.	Wabuyela emva.
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo.
He had to go to work.	Kwafuneka aye emsebenzini.
I don't really know what happened to me.	Andazi nyani ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
You told everything, everything exactly.	Uxelele yonke into, yonke into kanye.
And so he took a chance.	Kwaye ngoko wathatha ithuba.
But it really is.	Kodwa ngokwenene kunjalo.
My job left immediately.	Umsebenzi wam wemka ngokukhawuleza.
He did everything else well.	Wenza yonke enye into kakuhle.
I hope they succeed.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuphumelela.
But, of course, right? '	Kodwa, kunjalo, akunjalo?'.
He sat in the office for a few hours.	Wahlala eofisini iiyure ezimbalwa.
But not too hard.	Kodwa hayi nzima kakhulu.
He must arrive on time.	Kufuneka afike ngexesha.
You will get a chance to do a good job.	Uza kufumana ithuba lokwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
No work, no money.	Akukho msebenzi, akukho mali.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
I'm really sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa nyani.
He will never eat again.	Akasayi kuphinda atye.
I want to swim more.	Ndifuna ukuqubha ngakumbi .
But this one did it.	Kodwa lo wenze njalo.
That way, you have it.	Ngaloo ndlela, unayo.
Waiting while driving.	Ukulinda xa uqhuba.
He did just that when he got home.	Wayenza nje xa efika ekhaya.
He studied hard but did not succeed.	Wafunda nzima kodwa akazange aphumelele.
We'd better do it down here.	Kungcono siyenze phantsi apha phantsi.
The plan.	Licebo.
He slept a little.	Walala kancinci.
I do not want anywhere.	Andifuni ndawo.
I hope you are feeling better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono.
One ball, up.	Ibhola enye, phezulu.
I already know who he is.	Sele ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
Well, nowhere.	Ewe, akukho ndawo.
No more '.	Hayi kwakhona '.
He walked slowly.	Wahamba kancinci.
I'm just starting to see.	Ndiyaqala ukubona.
He opened the door and went inside.	Wavula ucango wangena.
And this creates a problem.	Kwaye oku kudala ingxaki.
Not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo.
And we want to go far.	Kwaye sifuna ukuya kude.
He thought it was possible.	Wayecinga ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I hope it's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile.
This is always difficult for me.	Oku kuhlala kunzima kum.
No, that's true.	Hayi, yinyani leyo.
He never came.	Zange eze.
Or you are trying to.	Okanye uzama ukuba.
Is true! 	Yinyani!
Down for sure, but without ?.	Phantsi ngokuqinisekileyo, kodwa ngaphandle?.
I never thought about it before.	Khange ndicinge ngayo ngaphambili.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You might be right.	Unokuba ulungile.
He came, saw, and died.	Weza, wabona, wafa.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Mhlawumbi kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze nto.
I told her the story.	Ndamxelela ibali.
I thought there was something wrong with her.	Bendicinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngaye.
I told you next week.	Ndikuxelele kwiveki ezayo.
Most people will want to stay with you.	Abantu abaninzi baya kufuna ukuhlala nawe.
He was just scared.	Wayesoyika nje.
It is good for everything.	Ilungile kuyo yonke into.
I'm happy to do it.	Ndiyavuya ukuyenza.
He pretends to be interested in the office.	Wenza ngathi unomdla eofisini.
But he is not in it.	Kodwa akakho kuyo.
I know you would like to have your friends.	Ndiyazi ungathanda ukuba nabahlobo bakho.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
Sure, he looks good.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ukhangeleka kakuhle.
You will go where you go.	Uya kuhamba apho uya khona.
He did not say a word to her.	Akazange athethe nto naye.
He made a big mistake.	Wenza impazamo enkulu.
What did I tell you.	Ndikuxelele ntoni.
Then something happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka into ethile.
You better say yes.	Kungcono uthi ewe.
After a while he spoke.	Emva kwexesha wathetha.
That's for sure.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo.
Look closely.	Jonga kakhulu.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbi yiyo yonke le nto.
Probably, he thought.	Mhlawumbi, wacinga.
To bed.	Ukuya ebhedini.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kakhulu.
He ate his lunch and quickly left.	Watya isidlo sakhe sasemini ngokukhawuleza wemka.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna ukuthetha naye kuphela.
He wanted to stay.	Wayefuna ukuhlala.
It was clear.	Kwakucacile.
I don't have to go anywhere.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndiye ndawo.
He thought about it.	Wacinga ngayo.
But he did not have it.	Kodwa akazange abe nayo.
You speak better.	Uthetha ngcono.
They say two hours.	Bathi iiyure ezimbini.
That has never happened before.	Oko akuzange kwenzeke ngaphambili.
Not the only way.	Hayi indlela kuphela.
However, we will have to do it again.	Nangona kunjalo, kuya kufuneka siyenze kwakhona.
Then here.	Emva koko apha.
I want to talk to you about it.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe ngaloo nto.
One person, however, was absent.	Umntu omnye, nangona kunjalo, wayengekho.
Everyone knows about you.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngawe.
She told me a little.	Undixelele kancinci.
I have to help others now.	Kufuneka ndincede abanye ngoku.
He said it was something he had to do.	Wathi yinto ekufuneka ayenze.
Now he looked up.	Ngoku wajonga phezulu.
We just did it.	Senze nje ukuba siyenze.
I never talked about it.	Zange ndithethe ngayo.
You will have to go faster though.	Kuya kufuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza nangona kunjalo.
I would never do such a thing again.	Soze ndiphinde ndiyenze into enje.
She would like to travel on time.	Angathanda ukuhamba ngexesha.
Who.	Ngubani na.
That, too, has been done.	Loo nto, nayo, yenziwe.
Finally he arrived.	Ekugqibeleni wafika.
I could not do that.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza loo nto.
Not always, of course.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kunjalo.
I tried everyone.	Ndazama wonke umntu.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Ndandifuna nje ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Just us.	Nathi nje .
It happened a long time ago.	Kwenzeka kudala.
He saw the ball.	Wabona ibhola.
If something is up to you.	Ukuba kukho into kuwe.
If you live.	Ukuba uhlala.
I don't know if you know.	Andazi noba uyayazi na.
You're lucky, that's.	Unethamsanqa, lowo.
Then, finally, he opened it.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni, wavula.
You know that is impossible.	Uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
It really can be easy.	Ngokwenene kunokuba lula.
I mean he is.	Ndithetha ukuba nguye.
So out.	Ngoko ngaphandle.
Also, you never knew.	Naye, awuzange wazi.
They say it takes time.	Bathi kuthatha ixesha.
And he was scared.	Kwaye wayesoyika.
There is definitely something wrong with him.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho into engalunganga kuye.
It is not difficult to see.	Akukho nzima ukubona.
Well, you know, everybody does it.	Ewe, uyazi, wonke umntu uyayenza.
And he understood.	Kwaye waqonda.
It was really clear.	Kwakucacile ngokwenene.
No, she did not tell anyone.	Hayi, akazange axelele mntu.
But he stayed in his place.	Kodwa wahlala kwindawo yakhe.
This will find a window.	Oku kuya kufumana ifestile.
He has to go his own way and be his own person.	Kufuneka ahambe ngendlela yakhe kwaye abe ngumntu wakhe.
And you have to tell me everything immediately.	Kwaye kufuneka undixelele yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
I didn't want to tell anyone.	Ndandingafuni ndixelele mntu.
But you have to come.	Kodwa kufuneka uze.
He did this very thing.	Wenza le nto kakhulu.
No one, though.	Akukho mntu, nangona kunjalo.
I'm sure this is what you think.	Ndiqinisekile yile nto ucinga ngayo.
He is just there for me.	Ukhona nje kum.
You knew better.	Ubusazi ngcono.
That would mean that he wanted to stay.	Oko bekuya kuthetha ukuba wayefuna ukuhlala.
I did this myself.	Ndiyenze ngokwam le nto.
You certainly know about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi ngayo.
Life.	Ubomi.
I did not know how or why.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
He slept and slept all day.	Walala kwaye walala imini yonke.
Yes, yes, but it is true.	Ewe, ewe, kodwa yinyani.
There is no work for you there.	Akukho msebenzi wakho apho.
There is one of us.	Kukho omnye wethu.
He will go with you if you like.	Uya kuhamba nawe ukuba uyathanda.
I know it is.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunjalo.
We will do just that.	Siya kuyenza loo nto kanye.
I could do that, you know.	Ndingayenza loo nto, uyazi.
And up.	Kwaye phezulu.
Maybe my wife.	Mhlawumbi umfazi wam.
The woman knew nothing about it.	Umfazi wayengazi nto ngaloo nto.
I thought about it.	Ndacinga ngayo.
I will definitely do so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kwenza njalo.
He thinks he is a good man.	Ucinga ukuba yindoda elungileyo.
It should have been easier.	Bekufanele kube lula.
It was not easy to walk.	Akuzange kube lula ukuhamba.
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le .
Well, a few things.	Kulungile, izinto ezimbalwa.
I'm asking for something from you.	Ndicela into kuwe.
I came to talk to you here.	Ndize kuthetha nawe apha.
He decided that it was impossible.	Wagqiba kwelokuba akunakwenzeka.
I could not work.	Khange ndikwazi ukusebenza.
Death.	Ukufa.
And much more.	Kwaye okuninzi ngakumbi.
Sudden death.	Ukufa ngokukhawuleza.
Yeah, maybe.	Ewe, mhlawumbi.
And it will happen soon.	Kwaye kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
He does, too.	Uyayenza, naye.
I had no idea what this was all about.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
He knows everything.	Wazi yonke into.
My mother went there.	Umama waya khona.
I never went anywhere.	Zange ndaya ndawo.
Probably not everywhere.	Mhlawumbi akukho ndawo yonke.
You just have to know where to look.	Kufuneka nje wazi ukuba ujonge phi.
Then he realized what it was.	Emva koko waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
That will go to this song.	Oko kuya kule ngoma.
I'm trying to do something good.	Ndizama ukwenza into entle.
But it has to be true.	Kodwa kuye kwafuneka ukuba yinyani.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uqhuba kakuhle.
And nothing of his.	Kwaye akukho nto yakhe.
Well, for me it is impossible.	Ewe, kum akunakwenzeka.
It would be nice to go to your place.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuya kwindawo yakho.
But it's time to do things together.	Kodwa lixesha lokuba wenze izinto kunye.
Here it is.	Yiyo ke le.
He did not do this.	Akazange enze oku.
Then he looked at her.	Emva koko wajonga kuye.
No one talks about it anymore.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngayo kwakhona.
Why he spoke, he did not know.	Kwakutheni ukuze athethe, wayengazi.
Don't read too much into it.	Musa ukufunda kakhulu kuyo.
Thanks for the question.	Enkosi ngalo mbuzo.
I can't tell you anything.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela nto.
And it can be painful.	Kwaye kunokuba buhlungu.
But not this way.	Kodwa hayi ngale ndlela.
I think you are, too.	Ndicinga ukuba unjalo, nawe.
He did it again.	Uyenzile kwakhona.
He spends a lot of time alone.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi eyedwa.
He doesn't want her to leave now.	Akafuni ahambe ngoku.
I did not go.	Khange ndihambe.
We just want to succeed.	Sifuna nje ukuphumelela.
I think he did a very good job.	Ndicinga ukuba wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
We need to do that.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
He had to move on.	Kwafuneka aye phambili.
I do not want to come.	Andifuni ukuza.
If you have to do that.	Ukuba kufuneka wenze njalo.
And we want to talk to you.	Kwaye sifuna ukuthetha nawe.
And you will be there.	Kwaye uya kuba lapho.
That is not the only problem.	Ayisiyiyo kuphela ingxaki leyo.
I'm not going anywhere.	Andiyi ndawo.
My only chance.	Ithuba lam kuphela.
A few weeks maybe.	Iiveki ezimbalwa mhlawumbi.
So, that seems fine.	Ngoko, oko kubonakala kulungile.
I did the same.	Ndenze njalo nam.
I never thought it would happen to me.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kwenzeka kum.
Someone has it.	Umntu unayo.
I'm not good at this.	Andikho mhle kule nto.
So we have to do the right thing.	Ke kufuneka senze into elungileyo.
You know why.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni.
Suddenly he felt like saying it all.	Ngokukhawuleza waziva efuna ukuyithetha yonke.
Or we go forward.	Okanye siya phambili.
I have never been there myself.	Andizange ndibe lapho mna.
So you have to make a decision.	Ngoko kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
And yet, there was none.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, kwakungekho namnye.
Maybe more time.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elingakumbi.
Good way.	Indlela elungileyo.
I know your wife.	Ndiyamazi umfazi wakho.
Give me anything.	Ndinike nantoni na.
And so it will be tomorrow.	Kwaye kuya kuba njalo ngomso.
It was nothing either way.	Kwakungekho nto nokuba yeyiphi na indlela.
But it is impossible to take everyone.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuthatha wonke umntu.
I wanted to do it tonight.	Bendifuna ukuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
They certainly will, however.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kwenza, nangona kunjalo.
This will eventually happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
asked the man.	wabuza umntu.
He leaves immediately afterwards.	Uhamba kwangoko emva koko.
What do you want.	Ingaba ufuna ntoni.
My marriage.	Umtshato wam.
In the meantime we will continue.	Okwangoku siza kuqhubeka.
Thanks for the debt.	Enkosi ityala.
But don't do that.	Kodwa musa ukuyenza loo nto.
And at the same time,.	Kwaye ngelo xesha,.
Look at me!	Ndijonge!
All of them.	Bonke.
But no one is there.	Kodwa akukho mntu apho.
I can't see why though.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba kutheni nangona kunjalo.
You talk to me.	Uthetha nam.
I, however, will not have it.	Mna, nangona kunjalo, andiyi kuba nayo.
Just before you look at me you are curious.	Kanye phambi kokuba ujonge kum unomdla.
Want to buy here?	Uyafuna ukuthenga apha?
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
He must know everything.	Kufuneka azi yonke into.
You must go with me.	Kufuneka uhambe nam.
All in one place.	Konke kwindawo enye.
I have done too much.	Ndenze okuninzi kakhulu.
He decided not to.	Wagqiba kwelokuba akunjalo.
This is really happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
I go to work.	Ndiya emsebenzini.
And so it would be.	Kwaye ke bekuya kuba njalo.
Good reading.	Ukufunda kakuhle.
I mean think about it.	Ndithetha ukucinga ngayo.
Nobody wants to.	Akukho mntu ufuna.
He will come to you.	Uza kuza kuwe.
Do not leave the house.	Musa ukuphuma endlwini.
No me, no.	Hayi mna, hayi.
Inside him.	Ngaphakathi kuye.
He said, it will certainly be.	Uthe, ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuba njalo.
Will he ever know.	Ngaba uya kuze akwazi.
And it's just a baby.	Kwaye ngumntwana kuphela.
It seemed then that this was the case.	Kwakubonakala ke ngoko ukuba yiloo nto.
Sorry now.	Uxolo ngoku.
Then he ran away.	Emva koko wabaleka.
Not your truth.	Hayi inyaniso yakho.
I never had any money.	Andizange ndibe nayo imali.
And maybe.	Kwaye mhlawumbi.
He knew that a mother would want to be with her children.	Wayesazi ukuba umama uya kufuna ukuba kunye nabantwana bakhe.
But there are a few questions.	Kodwa kukho imibuzo embalwa.
I never thought about it.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo.
Everything is going strong.	Konke kuhamba ngamandla.
He did not know what to think of it.	Wayengazi ukuba acinge ntoni ngaloo nto.
I don't want you to leave.	Andifuni ukuba uhambe.
You have to tell me what's wrong.	Kufuneka undixelele ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
But this is something new.	Kodwa le yinto entsha.
And he did just that.	Kwaye wakwenza oko.
But then something happened to him.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka into ethile kuye.
Who did it? 	Ngubani owenze?
I'm glad I did.	Mna ndiyavuya mna.
You always try to do the right thing.	Uhlala uzama ukwenza into elungileyo.
And many people will come.	Kwaye abantu abaninzi baya kuza.
In the end, that's my job.	Ekugqibeleni, ngumsebenzi wam lowo.
It could be me, too.	Inokuba ndim, kwaye.
Look for something unusual.	Jonga into engaqhelekanga.
As you like.	Njengokuba uthanda.
There seems to be no problem with this.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho ngxaki ngale nto.
Great place.	Indawo kakhulu.
Taking it together.	Ukuthatha kuyo kunye.
Good man.	Umntu olungileyo.
You have it right there.	Unayo kanye apho.
I'll have to take a look.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge.
Everyone knew everything.	Wonke umntu wayesazi yonke into.
Even so.	Nangona kunjalo.
And so it should.	Kwaye ngoko kufuneka.
Nothing comes to him.	Akukho nto iza kuye.
Look at the work.	Jonga umsebenzi.
You know what happens.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Nobody is going to talk to me.	Akukho mntu uza kuthetha nam.
I did well in class.	Ndihambe kakuhle eklasini.
He didn't want to do it again.	Wayengafuni kuyenza kwakhona.
Please, please.	Nceda, nceda.
I want you to know this.	Ndifuna uyazi lento.
I know you're busy.	Ndiyayazi ukuba uxakekile.
Right in front of me.	Kanye phambi kwam.
Succeeding has never been so easy.	Ukuphumelela akuzange kube lula kangako.
But it has been.	Kodwa kube njalo.
Very much, but not exactly.	Kakhulu, kodwa hayi ncam.
I just didn’t want to.	Ndandingafuni nje.
As long as you didn't know it, it didn't.	Nje ukuba ubungazi, akunjalo.
There was no way to it.	Kwakungekho ndlela kuyo.
Please look at the case, please.	Nceda ujonge ityala, nceda.
In bed.	Ebhedini.
Maybe all will go well this time.	Mhlawumbi konke kuya kuhamba kakuhle ngeli xesha.
Maybe he wanted her to know.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukuba azi.
I didn't know if that was a good thing or not.	Ndandingazi nokuba yinto entle leyo okanye hayi.
He looked up, and she looked back.	Wajonga, waza naye wajonga ngasemva.
And he himself, of course.	Kwaye ngokwakhe, kunjalo.
This is the place.	Yile ndawo.
Stop it.	Yeka kwanto.
I wanted to sit down.	Bendifuna ukuhlala phantsi.
Everyone goes home.	Wonke umntu uya ekhaya.
You should be here, too.	Ufanele ukuba lapha, naye.
To me, well, I did it just because I wanted to.	Kum, ke, ndiyenze nje kuba ndifuna.
He did not seem to be doing much.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akukho nto ingako ayenzileyo.
It takes time.	Kuthatha ixesha.
Your work is only long.	Umsebenzi wakho mde kuphela.
I do not know why.	Andazi kutheni.
He opened the door easily and walked out.	Wavula ucango lula waphuma.
But someone had to do it.	Kodwa umntu kwafuneka ayenze.
I hope you say no.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uthi hayi.
You will need to learn more.	Kuya kufuneka ukufunda ngakumbi.
Not his thing.	Hayi into yakhe.
You look so much better.	Ukhangeleka ungcono kakhulu.
I have not been able to go there yet.	Khange ndikwazi ukuya apho okwangoku.
However, this does not have to be the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akufuneki kube njalo.
I speak well.	Ndithetha kakuhle.
And that is my hope.	Kwaye lithemba lam elo.
Not in that case.	Hayi kuloo meko.
Once you have them, they will demand money.	Xa sele unayo, baya kufuna imali.
My father did not want alcohol.	Utata wayengafuni utywala.
He said he never did.	Wathi akazange enjenjalo.
Long back.	Ixesha elide emva.
I'm glad you like it though.	Ndiyavuya uyayithanda nangona kunjalo.
One day, it might be you.	Ngenye imini, inokuba nguwe.
He opened the door and looked down.	Wavula ucango wajonga phantsi.
You've done the right thing, come forward.	Wenze into elungileyo, uze ngaphambili.
We will certainly do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kwenza njalo.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo yonke into.
I told him yes, I told him.	Ndamxelela ewe, ndamxelela.
Now if you like it, fine.	Ngoku ukuba uyayithanda, kulungile.
Your wife is very beautiful.	Mhle kakhulu umfazi wakho.
One way is by being alone.	Enye indlela kukuba wedwa.
Then he thought of something.	Emva koko wacinga into ethile.
That would be great, you know.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle, uyazi.
I could not win.	Andikwazanga ukuphumelela.
You just want to play.	Ufuna nje ukudlala.
He didn't want to, he thought.	Wayengafuni, wayecinga ukuba.
Unless he did and can't now.	Ngaphandle kokuba akazange kwaye akakwazi ngoku.
I have to stay away from that, for sure.	Kufuneka ndihlale kude kuloo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I think staying with you in bed is okay.	Ndicinga ukuhlala nawe ebhedini kulungile.
And that's fine for me.	Kwaye kulungile kum.
This, however, he did not do.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akazange akwenze.
I did this.	Ndiyenzile lento.
And you don't want to.	Kwaye awufuni.
His play ended.	Ukudlala kwakhe kwaphela.
The house, however.	Indlu, nangona kunjalo.
In my town.	Edolophini yam.
I'm not sure that's true.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinyani leyo.
I still do not understand.	Nangoku andiqondi.
Just now .	Ngoku .
How did we do it?	Senze njani?
He wanted to get out.	Wayefuna ukuphuma.
Just going.	Ukuya nje.
See my answer here.	Jonga impendulo yam apha.
I'll do very well, now.	Ndiza kwenza kakuhle kakhulu, ngoku.
Yeah, you know.	Ewe, uyazi.
During this time he learned a great deal.	Ngeli xesha wafunda okuninzi kakhulu.
I wanted to go.	Ndandifuna ukuhamba.
He does not need to be rude.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba athethe kakubi.
You eat with it.	Utya ngayo.
And nothing.	Kwaye akukho nto.
And something happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into.
This place is for sure.	Le ndawo ngokuqinisekileyo.
No, it is not someone else.	Hayi, ayinguye omnye umntu.
I like it here.	Ndiyayithanda apha.
Or marriage.	Okanye umtshato.
It's time for me to go now.	Lixesha lokuba ndihambe ngoku.
I wanted to have children.	Ndandifuna ukuba nabantwana.
It's very difficult, after all.	Kunzima kakhulu, emva koko.
I will get a new job.	Ndiza kufumana umsebenzi omtsha.
We will stay together.	Siya kuhlala kunye.
He did not go far.	Akazange aye kude.
Or maybe a lot of people.	Okanye mhlawumbi abantu abaninzi.
I told her what had happened.	Ndamxelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He wanted to come.	Wayefuna ukuza.
No one saw or heard anything.	Akukho mntu wabona okanye weva nto.
I never did.	Khange ndiphinde.
But he asked me.	Kodwa wandibuza.
I thought that was it.	Ndandicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
We have both gone.	Siye sobabini.
Really, too far.	Ngokwenene, kude kakhulu.
I like it, very much.	Ndiyayithanda, kakhulu.
I can't see that it's true.	Andikwazi ukubona ukuba yinyani.
I will be in it.	Ndiza kuba kuyo.
Getting a job.	Ukufumana umsebenzi.
So, that will mean everyone.	Ngoko, oko kuya kuthetha wonke umntu.
And when.	Kwaye nini.
How do you do that?	Uyenza njani kanye loo nto?
This will be difficult for him.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kuye.
And the first woman, too, for that.	Kwaye umfazi wokuqala, naye, ngaloo nto.
I hoped it was all he wanted.	Bendinethemba lokuba yiyo yonke into ayifunayo.
Tell me how you like it.	Ndixelele ukuba uthanda njani.
It should be ready as soon as possible.	Kufuneka ilungile ngokukhawuleza.
I'll see what happens.	Ndiza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
My mother never said anything to me.	Umama akazange athethe nantoni na kum.
Everyone knows now.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngoku.
I don't know what you are talking about.	Andazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
I'm not sure this is possible.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
I wanted to do the same thing.	Ndandifuna ukwenza into efanayo.
There was no need for him to speak.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe.
We will talk to him.	Siza kuthetha naye.
It has happened to me.	Kwakhe kwenzeka kum.
Everyone went down the aisle.	Wonke umntu wehla ecaleni.
She's doing very well now.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu ngoku.
Or don't.	Okanye musa.
No, not really.	Hayi, hayi ngokwenene.
He was going to leave.	Wayeza kuhamba.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni.
And he would do it.	Kwaye wayeza kuyenza.
It has to mean something.	Kufuneka kuthetha into.
I'll talk to him soon.	Ndiza kuthetha naye kungekudala.
He arrived late.	Wafika emva kwexesha.
Ready to go?	Le ukuhamba?
But not you.	Kodwa hayi wena.
Bad place.	Indawo embi.
I will come in the afternoon.	Ndiza kuza emva kwemini.
But he was visible.	Kodwa wayebonakala.
Sorry you can't succeed.	Uxolo awukwazi ukuphumelela.
I thought so.	Ndandicinga njalo.
This is a strange thing.	Le yinto engaqhelekanga.
But me.	Kodwa mna.
I don’t want anyone to know, really.	Andifuni nabani na ukuba azi, ngokwenene.
No food.	Akukho kutya.
For being here.	Ngokuba lapha.
We will do just that.	Siza kuyenza kanye loo nto.
It seemed like a good idea.	Kwakubonakala ngathi licebo elihle.
Throughout the house.	Kuyo yonke indlu.
But, of course, he never did.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange enjenjalo.
So it is with death.	Kunjalo ke ukufa.
I am a mother.	Ndim umama.
He may have died right away.	Usenokuba wafa ngoko nangoko.
He may not be here.	Usenokuba akakho.
His mother, his father.	Umama wakhe, utata wakhe.
He never thought of that.	Akazange acinge nto ngaloo nto.
I thought it was good.	Bendicinga ukuba kuhle.
That requires two things.	Oko kufuna izinto ezimbini.
Yes, yes and no.	Ewe, ewe kwaye hayi.
I don't care now.	Andikhathali ngoku.
And so it was.	Kwaye kube njalo.
So it can be.	Ngoko inokuba njalo.
It will happen to you that way, too.	Kuya kwenzeka kuwe ngolo hlobo, nawe.
I will do that if you would like me to do so.	Ndiya kukwenza oko ukuba ungathanda ukuba ndenze njalo.
I told you that myself.	Ndikuxelele lonto mna.
This will do two things.	Oku kuya kwenza izinto ezimbini.
You know when.	Uyazi ukuba nini.
He was not really going anywhere.	Wayengayi ndawo ngokwenene.
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba.
That makes two.	Oko kwenza ezimbini.
I can't win then.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela ngoko.
You can or should not.	Awukwazi okanye awukwazi.
But it is better at night.	Kodwa kungcono ebusuku.
I just mean what it is.	Ndithetha nje ukuba yintoni.
She thinks she is beautiful.	Ucinga ukuba mhle.
For a long time, too.	Ixesha elide, kakhulu.
I do not want to be here.	Andifuni ukuba lapha.
Please wait here.	Ndicela ulinde apha.
I like it though.	Ndiyayithanda kodwa.
He did not want us to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuba senze njalo.
I want to be beautiful.	Ndifuna ukuba mhle.
There is a mother too.	Kukho umama naye.
My children.	Abantwana bam.
I'm sure that	Ndiqinisekile ukuba
Yes, this is happening.	Ewe, kwenzeka oku.
To be successful, you need to be willing.	Ukuze uphumelele kufuneka uzimisele.
And this is not possible.	Kwaye oku akunakwenzeka.
I think you are smart.	Ndicinga ukuba ukrelekrele.
Then he went down again.	Emva koko wehla kwakhona.
He makes coffee.	Wenza ikofu.
But it is definitely worth it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka.
A good marriage requires work.	Umtshato olungileyo ufuna umsebenzi.
And he never did that.	Kwaye akazange ayenze loo nto.
He did not want to be.	Akazange afune ukuba njalo.
However, at first.	Nangona kunjalo, ekuqaleni.
He's out here with all of us.	Ulapha phandle nathi sonke.
Better that way.	Ngcono ngolo hlobo.
I can't go to him.	Andikwazi ukuya kuye.
It was not down.	Kwakungekho phantsi.
But they did not go anywhere.	Kodwa abazange baye ndawo.
I'm not sure about everything.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo yonke into.
He does not want to come.	Akafuni ukuza.
I'm sure you know that.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
This one came down.	Wehla lo.
You do not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku.
Two weeks? 	Iiveki ezimbini?
I saw something else.	Ndabona enye into.
Everything is fine.	Yonke into ilungile.
I really know this.	Ngokwenene ndiyayazi le nto.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo.
You have to make a decision.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
But it happened this way.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngale ndlela.
Inside and then downstairs.	Ngaphakathi kwaye emva koko phantsi.
Maybe you don't want to.	Mhlawumbi awufuni.
I didn't think much of it.	Khange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo.
I just want to meet him.	Ndifuna nje ukudibana naye.
Not exactly.	Akunjalo ncam.
Or not really.	Okanye akunjalo ngokwenene.
But then again maybe not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did what he wanted to do.	Wenza into afuna ukuyenza.
I could not see the error.	Andikwazanga ukubona impazamo.
I wanted that with him.	Bendifuna lonto naye.
He always told me.	Wandixelela njalo.
He ran away.	Wabaleka wemka.
Sorry, no sorry.	Uxolo, hayi uxolo.
Just look at you.	Jonga nje wena.
He travels for years.	Uhamba ngeminyaka.
This happened last week.	Oku kwenzeke kwiveki ephelileyo.
It was not as difficult as he thought it would be.	Akuzange kube nzima njengoko wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
You think a lot and not at all.	Ucinga kakhulu hayi kwaphela.
I'm not very pretty.	Andikho mhle kakhulu.
I can see why.	Ndiyakwazi ukubona ukuba kutheni.
He makes up a story right away.	Wenza ibali kwangoko.
They certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kwenza njalo.
In this case, it is very bad.	Kule meko, kakubi kakhulu.
A voice behind me.	Ilizwi emva kwam.
See if you can see which one.	Jonga ukuba uyakwazi ukubona ukuba yeyiphi.
I don't know what could happen to me.	Andazi ukuba kusenokwenzeka ntoni kum.
Just another thing.	Enye into nje.
To be with him.	Ukuba naye.
I told her the whole thing.	Ndamxelela yonke lonto.
He spoke immediately.	Uthethe ngoko nangoko.
That is absolutely true.	Yinyani leyo ngokupheleleyo.
Then he ran away.	Emva koko wabaleka wemka.
He is not on time.	Akakho ngexesha.
We will do it because it has to be done.	Siza kuyenza kuba kufuneka yenziwe.
You don't want to, obviously.	Awufuni, ngokucacileyo.
But not far enough.	Kodwa hayi kude ngokwaneleyo.
Let me see it.	Makhe ndimbone.
I have never been really high.	Andizange ndibe phezulu ngokwenene.
So there you have it.	Ngoko kukho loo nto.
I do not know.	Andazi ke.
Clearly, he saw.	Ngokucacileyo, wabona.
This is obvious.	Oku kucacile.
Just in front of him.	Kanye phambi kwakhe.
He could not.	Akazange akwazi.
I don’t always know.	Andazi ngalo lonke ixesha.
He could not keep quiet.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala wathi tu.
I don't want to do that again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndiyenze lonto.
Everyone is talking about that new restaurant.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngaloo ndawo yokutyela entsha.
He could not make a decision.	Akazange akwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
And you know you can do it.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba ungayenza.
Home doctor.	Ugqirha wasekhaya.
Well, you think of me, okay.	Kulungile, ucinga ngam, kulungile.
I cannot say for sure.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
He did not know what had happened to him.	Wayengazi kwanto eyenzekileyo kuye.
They are everywhere.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo.
Thank you, very good.	Enkosi, kuhle kakhulu.
Her mother always read the book.	Umama wakhe wahlala wafunda incwadi.
Don't think too much.	Musa ukucinga kakhulu.
Yes you read well.	Ewe ufunda kakuhle.
And that's all.	Kwaye yiyo yonke loo nto.
But he kept going.	Kodwa waqhubeka.
If it's just something.	Ukuba nje into.
I never heard from again.	Andizange ndive kwakhona.
He would tell her.	Wayeza kumxelela.
I would really like to see someone new.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukubona umntu omtsha.
It's your job now.	Ngumsebenzi wakho ngoku.
You want to succeed right away.	Ufuna ukuphumelela ngoko nangoko.
This means two things.	Oku kuthetha izinto ezimbini.
But he wanted to know.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwazi.
And then you go.	Kwaye emva koko uya.
That happened, of course.	Oko kwenzeka, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I can't wait to see everything.	Andikwazi kulinda ukubona yonke into.
I see no problem in it.	Andiboni ngxaki kuyo.
In your house.	Endlini yakho.
There was no need for him to tell her.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba amxelele.
I couldn't do it without you.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza ngaphandle kwakho.
Not just too bad.	Hayi nje kakubi kakubi.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela .
Look at your book.	Jonga incwadi yakho.
There are books about that.	Kukho iincwadi malunga naloo nto.
Everyone loves it !.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda !.
Very good for you.	Kuhle kakhulu kuwe.
Like me, today.	Njengam, namhlanje.
You are like me and you.	Ufana nam nawe.
Debt to him.	Ityala kuye.
He has to be.	Kufuneka abe njalo.
It was not right for anyone to come with him.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba umntu eze naye.
I did not do any good work for him.	Andizange ndenze umsebenzi olungileyo kuye.
For money.	Ngemali.
Tell me why you are here.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni ulapha.
This is always the case.	Oku kuhlala kunjalo.
I do not believe otherwise.	Andikholelwa ngenye indlela.
You don't think about anything else.	Awucingi ngenye into.
He does some things first.	Wenza ezinye izinto kuqala.
What's that?	Yintoni lo nto?
Maybe that's what happened here.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto eyenzekayo apha.
Not so there.	Akunjalo phaya.
Then he stays in the hospital until he is ready to leave.	Emva koko uhlala esibhedlele de ukulungele ukuhamba.
We know.	Siyazi.
He will never do anything to you again.	Soze aphinde akwenze nto.
Everyone.	Wonke umntu.
I think someone else spoke well.	Ndicinga ukuba omnye umntu uthethe kakuhle.
I would like to know what you think.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni kuthetha.
Or, then.	Okanye, ke.
But, he loves to talk.	Kodwa, uthanda kakhulu ukuthetha.
Fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza.
You say something, you say something.	Uthetha into, uthetha into.
You look down a lot most of the time.	Ujonge phantsi kakhulu ixesha elininzi.
I look forward to doing just that.	Ndijonge phambili ukwenza oko.
It just comes out.	Ileta nje.
You did not expect it to be so difficult today.	Zange ulindele ukuba namhlanje kunzima kangaka.
But there is a small problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki encinci.
There was no one inside.	Kwakungekho mntu ngaphakathi.
I had no idea how he knew that.	Ndandingazi ukuba uyazi njani loo nto.
He left immediately.	Wahamba ngoko nangoko.
Then you talk to him.	Emva koko uthetha naye.
He did not know how he knew this.	Wayengazi ukuba uyazi njani le nto.
It can be difficult.	Kunokuba nzima.
And before.	Kwaye ngaphambili.
Well, maybe that's true.	Ewe, mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
You will want to know.	Uya kufuna ukwazi.
Not true.	Hayi yinyani.
I need to know.	Kufuneka ndiyazi.
I can't think.	Andikwazi ukucinga.
He will never do this again.	Akasayi kuphinda ayenze le nto.
That would be better.	Oko bekuya kuba ngcono.
I'm not sure what it is, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni, nangona kunjalo.
You know what's going to happen.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni na.
We know where you live.	Siyazi apho uhlala khona.
I have to learn some things.	Kufuneka ndifunde ezinye izinto.
The truth is, you love it.	Inyaniso kukuba, uyayithanda.
Then he came out.	Emva koko waphuma.
He came out.	Waphuma.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
It happens, you know.	Kwenzeka, uyazi.
I try hard.	Ndizama ngamandla.
I always think about this though.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngale nto kunjalo.
He knows everything about it.	Wazi yonke into ngayo.
Well, maybe he will and maybe he won't.	Ewe, mhlawumbi uya kwenza kwaye mhlawumbi akayi.
I only do my homework.	Ndenza umsebenzi wasekhaya kuphela.
Not for long, though.	Hayi ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
It took a long time.	Wathatha ixesha elide.
No, he thought.	Hayi, wacinga.
It is not necessary now.	Akufuneki ngoku.
But nobody says anything.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha nto.
Why he didn't, it's hard to say.	Kutheni engazange, kunzima ukuthetha.
How do you do this?	Uyenza njani le nto?
Stop everything.	Yeka yonke into.
And it's not easy.	Kwaye akukho lula.
He is very determined.	Uzimisele kakhulu.
This is a person.	Lo ngumntu.
I don't want to see anything.	Andifuni kubona nto.
He looked around the house.	Wajonga endlini.
He did not sit on the sidelines.	Akazange ahlale ecaleni.
I think this is something we need to do together.	Ndicinga ukuba le nto kufuneka siyenze kunye.
There is one thing.	Kukho into enye.
Everyone is moving slowly.	Wonke umntu uhamba kancinci.
I just don't know.	Andazi nje.
And he went on.	Waqhubeka ke.
I never heard of him.	Andizange ndive ngaye.
Probably not necessary.	Mhlawumbi akukho mfuneko.
Let him do this.	Makayenze lento.
That's fine.	Kulungile ukuba.
So this is going to be fun.	Ngoko oku kuya kuba mnandi.
So why did you do that? 	Ngoko kutheni uyenzile loo nto?
And he did that.	Kwaye wayenza loo nto.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke into leyo.
So it is with me.	Kunjalo ke kum.
He was wearing a gun.	Wayenxibe umpu.
That's my time.	Lixesha lam elo.
He came for dinner.	Weza ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
Yeah, to tell you what happened.	Ewe, ukukuxelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I don't want to be this.	Andifuni ukuba ndim lo.
That's not me.	Ayindim lowo.
Well, that's not it.	Ewe, ayisiyiyo leyo.
He never came after her.	Akazange eze emva kwakhe.
The problem.	Ingxaki.
And then it becomes very easy.	Kwaye ke kuba lula kakhulu.
And very quickly.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza ngokukhawuleza.
I do not believe it will happen.	Andikholelwa ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
I know, it hurts.	Ndiyazi, buhlungu.
And still nothing.	Kwaye nangoku akukho nto.
How did he do it?	Wakwenza njani oko?
But he said so.	Kodwa wathetha kunjalo.
And, that's perfectly fine.	Kwaye, oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
But he certainly would do so.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuyenza loo nto.
No one asked questions.	Akukho mntu wabuza imibuzo.
Thank you so much for all your help !.	Enkosi kakhulu ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho!.
He wants to go to college.	Ufuna ukuya ekholejini.
Maybe that's right.	Mhlawumbi ilungile loo nto.
But the picture.	Kodwa umfanekiso.
We need to move faster.	Kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
I'll wait and see what happens.	Ndiza kulinda ndibone ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
But nothing happened.	Kodwa akukho nto yenzekileyo.
And maybe not.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
He finally left.	Wagqiba wahamba.
How strange!	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo!
Look at the picture here.	Jonga umfanekiso apha.
It will be here.	Iza kuba apha.
And that's a bad thing.	Kwaye yinto embi leyo.
It's been years.	Sele iminyaka.
He said he did not know why he did that.	Wathi akasazi isizathu sokuba enze loo nto.
You're good to me, you know.	Ulungile kum, uyazi.
My marriage.	Umtshato wam .
He knows his phone.	Uyayazi ifowuni yakhe.
So you can have him.	Ngoko unokuba naye.
I live here.	Ndihlala apha.
I am the one you should have.	Ndim lowo ufanele ukuba naye.
He spoke for a long time.	Wathetha ixesha elide.
And what else.	Kwaye yintoni enye.
Once for me.	Kanye kum.
No one wants such money.	Akukho mntu ufuna imali enjalo.
We know that for sure.	Siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
Almost everyone, of course.	Phantse wonke umntu, kunjalo.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
Whatever he does, he is determined to stay with her.	Nantoni na ayenzileyo, uzimisele ukuhlala naye.
He walked and looked back.	Wahamba wajonga ngasemva.
Not the other way around.	Hayi ngenye indlela.
It's a wonderful thing that is happening.	Yinto entle kakhulu eyenzekayo.
Someone wants to make you look bad.	Umntu ufuna ukwenza ujonge kakubi.
It certainly seems to be true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi inokuba yinyani.
Almost everyone.	Phantse wonke umntu.
No one knows everything, or many things.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into, okanye izinto ezininzi.
You need to be able to see it in it.	Kufuneka ukwazi ukubona kuyo.
And then he didn't think of anything to say.	Kwaye ke akazange acinge nantoni na ukuba athethe.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
The doctor says she is feeling better.	Ugqirha uthi uziva ngcono.
I don't like it there.	Andiyithandi phaya.
Good credit since then.	Ityala elihle ukusukela oko.
However he knows he has to stay home.	Nangona kunjalo uyazi ukuba kufuneka ahlale ekhaya.
The same thing happened.	Kwenzeka into efanayo.
And he has been very successful.	Kwaye uphumelele kakhulu.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ndizama ukufumana omnye umsebenzi.
We will go to the park in the afternoon.	Siza kuya epakini emva kwemini.
Again, nothing big.	Kwakhona, akukho nto enkulu.
And he knew it was true.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba yinyani.
I mean completely.	Ndithetha ngokupheleleyo.
But no one comes to me.	Kodwa akukho mntu uza kum.
Not so here, of course.	Akunjalo apha, kunjalo.
You have to do something.	Kufuneka wenze into.
But you know one thing.	Kodwa wazi into enye.
Reading the book will require a few days.	Ukufunda incwadi siya kufuna iintsuku ezimbalwa.
But everywhere.	Kodwa yonke indawo.
I hope you can do it.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza.
It is my job.	Ngumsebenzi wam.
I'm telling the truth.	Ndithetha inyaniso.
If you have ever had the opportunity to do so you should.	Ukuba ukhe wafumana ithuba lokwenza njalo kufuneka.
He's just trying to do the right thing.	Uzama nje ukwenza into elungileyo.
Himself.	Ngokwakhe.
Just my son again.	Unyana wam nje kwakhona.
Not so much, really.	Akunjalo kakhulu, ngokwenene.
You have it right here.	Unayo kanye apha.
It is very difficult to earn money.	Kunzima kakhulu ukufumana imali.
Finally, he agreed.	Ekugqibeleni, wavuma.
Oh no !.	Hayi lo!.
Now the problem.	Ngoku ingxaki.
He has done this before.	Uye wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
How about it ?.	Njani ngayo?.
I just got home.	Ndifike nje ekhaya.
Probably a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala ngaphambili.
I'm not sure how I did it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani.
It certainly would.	Ngokuqinisekileyo bekuya kuba njalo.
I will not try this week.	Andiyi kuzama kule veki.
I mean no.	Ndithetha hayi.
I can't work.	Andikwazi ukusebenza.
What time is it?	Ngubani ixesha?
Here's another one.	Nantso ke enye.
I'm not sure how you do it.	Andazi ncam ukuba uyenza njani.
I'm not sure about you.	Andiqinisekanga ngawe.
He did what he did.	Wenza into ayenzileyo.
We need to know what's going on.	Kufuneka siyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And he didn't know.	Kwaye wayengazi.
This is soon.	Oku kungekudala.
We will do it again tomorrow.	Siza kuphinda ngomso.
And then again.	Kwaye kwakhona kwakhona.
This becomes a little difficult.	Oku kuba nzima kancinci.
He can drive.	Uyakwazi ukuqhuba.
This was obvious.	Oku kwakucacile.
Well, I told you what.	Ke, ndikuxelele ntoni.
You feel so much better now.	Uziva engcono kakhulu ngoku.
Yeah, whatever.	Ewe, nokuba yintoni na.
But the other three.	Kodwa abanye abathathu.
Well where are you going.	Kulungile apho uya khona.
It is you and you know it.	Nguwe kwaye uyayazi.
It's not me.	Ayindim.
What exactly happened.	Kwenzeka ntoni kanye kanye.
Please go without me.	Ndicela uhambe ngaphandle kwam.
He looked up badly.	Wajonga phezulu kakubi.
Yes, anyone can make a mistake.	Ewe, nabani na angayenza impazamo.
You only have to do it once.	Kufuneka uyenze kube kanye kuphela.
Or a car.	Okanye imoto.
I do not want that to happen to me.	Andifuni yenzeke kum lonto.
All of a sudden.	Kungekudala.
I doubt it is possible.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He was very left.	Wayesele kakhulu.
Also some more for me.	Kwakhona ezinye ngakumbi kum.
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
He never came home.	Akazange eze ekhaya.
She felt better now.	Waziva engcono ngoku.
We made life.	Senze ubomi.
I just want it to happen.	Ndifuna nje ukuba yenzeke.
For what, he did not know.	Kuba yintoni, wayengazi.
This happened once.	Oku kwenzeka kanye.
What the hell.	Yintoni.
I will keep an eye out.	Ndiza kuhlala ndijonge.
Yes, in the office.	Ewe, eofisini.
Now look at you.	Ngoku jonga ngawe.
Very good, really.	Kuhle kakhulu, ngokwenene.
He made it easy for her.	Wayenza lula loo nto.
I'd better make it easy for me.	Kungcono ndenze kube lula kum.
Almost in a strange way.	Phantse ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
It's hard but here.	Kunzima kodwa apha.
I will come.	Ndiza kuza.
I did not want to die.	Ndandingafuni ukufa.
We need a doctor right away.	Sifuna ugqirha ngokukhawuleza.
Or tonight, or just then.	Okanye ngokuhlwanje, okanye kanye ngoko.
People live here.	Abantu bahlala apha.
It's hard to imagine.	Kunzima ukucinga.
It's hard to imagine now.	Kunzima ukucinga ngoku.
But now there is a problem.	Kodwa ngoku kukho ingxaki.
Because of him.	Ngenxa yakhe.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
And maybe he was thinking.	Kwaye mhlawumbi wayecinga.
But it will not be long.	Kodwa akuyi kuthatha ixesha elide.
Because tomorrow.	Kuba kusasa.
Watch what happens.	Ujonge into eyenzekayo.
The question, of course, is when.	Umbuzo, ngokuqinisekileyo, kukuba nini.
He has to be real.	Ufanele abe nguye ngokwenene.
I have to think about this.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngale nto.
I will do this.	Ndiza kuyenza le nto.
Yeah, it's better.	Ewe, kungcono.
They will do anything.	Baza kwenza nantoni na.
If this.	Ukuba oku.
But he does.	Kodwa uyayenza.
That's what we want to be.	Yiloo nto sifuna ukuba yiyo.
We will come back later and do more.	Siza kubuya emva kwexesha kwaye senze ezinye.
He said no, no he can't do that.	Wathi hayi, hayi akanakuyenza lonto.
He often does.	Udla ngokwenza njalo.
He studied hard to become a doctor.	Wafunda nzima ukuze abe ngugqirha.
And inside, you know that.	Kwaye ngaphakathi, uyayazi loo nto.
But he did not show up.	Kodwa khange abonakale.
I want you to know.	Ndifuna wazi.
He has gone out.	Uye waphuma.
Time for him to leave.	Ixesha lokuba ahambe.
Yes, but he did not.	Ewe, kodwa akazange.
Maybe one day, but for now.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini, kodwa okwangoku.
You know you want to.	Uyazi ukuba uyafuna.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
He will surely live again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala kwakhona.
You will tell her that you love her.	Uya kumxelela ukuba uyamthanda.
I don't want your money.	Andifuni mali yakho.
I'm starting now to see why.	Ndiyaqala ngoku ukubona ukuba kutheni.
This is the same thing.	Le yinto enye.
That will take a very long time.	Oko kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
Small talk.	Ukuthetha kancinci.
What do you think?	Umele ukuba ucinga ntoni?
I did not look inside.	Khange ndijonge ngaphakathi.
I will not be here.	Andiyi kuba lapha.
You're right here.	Ulungile ukuba lapha.
Next time, maybe.	Ngexesha elizayo, mhlawumbi.
Or make dinner.	Okanye ukwenza isidlo sangokuhlwa.
To me, eating out is a big deal.	Kum, ukutya ngaphandle yinto enkulu.
We know about it now though.	Siyazi ngayo ngoku nangona kunjalo.
Or read about it.	Okanye ukufunda ngayo.
I don't want you to think about me.	Andifuni ukuba ucinge ngam.
It is impossible to do so.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenjenjalo.
You will find something to do.	Uya kufumana into yokwenza.
He didn't want to get out of bed.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma ebhedini.
What happened in that situation.	Kwenzeka ntoni kuloo meko.
Well, a little bit.	Kulungile, kancinci kancinci.
I have to tell my man.	Kufuneka ndimxelele umntu wam.
Until last week.	Kude kube kwiveki ephelileyo.
Maybe if you just told him.	Mhlawumbi ukuba umxelele nje .
He works there, too.	Usebenza apho, naye.
I look forward to it.	Ndijonge phambili kuyo.
Thank you very much, that's all.	Enkosi kakhulu, yiyo yonke loo nto.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
I never thought it would be so.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kunjalo.
We are all together.	Sonke kunye.
You look tired.	Ukhangeleka udiniwe.
They’re going to get enough, and that’s it.	Baza kufumana ngokwaneleyo, kwaye yiloo nto.
Your new book is coming soon.	Incwadi yakho entsha iza kungekudala.
Or he will.	Okanye uya kwenza.
Finally, check your phone.	Ekugqibeleni, jonga ifowuni yakho.
Let me help you.	Makhe ndincede.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngalo nto.
No one wanted this.	Akukho mntu wayefuna le nto.
I always think so and so will you.	Ndihlala ndicinga njalo kwaye nawe uya kuba njalo.
I did not wait long.	Khange ndilinde ixesha elide.
He walked out of the bedroom.	Waphuma egumbini lokulala.
Again, the same thing.	Kwakhona, into enye.
But I ask for help.	Kodwa ndicela uncedo.
I can't work well.	Andikwazi ukusebenza kakuhle.
As many people as possible.	Abantu abaninzi kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni ngokwenene.
And so, really.	Kwaye kunjalo, ngokwenene.
You have to make money.	Kufuneka wenze imali.
Though he was afraid, he stayed.	Nangona wayesoyika, wahlala.
I don’t know much at the time.	Andazi kakhulu ngelo xesha.
You think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu.
Swimming can be fun.	Ukuqubha kunokuba mnandi.
I don't have that.	Andinayo loo nto.
Everyone wants to be first.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba ngowokuqala.
It will be easier, but it will happen in the end.	Kuya kuba kude kube lula, kodwa kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
Okay again.	Kulungile kwakhona.
Everyone speaks well, but it is difficult.	Wonke umntu uthetha kakuhle, kodwa kunzima.
And he was sad because of her.	Kwaye waba buhlungu ngenxa yakhe.
We should have that.	Sifanele sibe nayo loo nto.
Tell your friends about it !.	Xelela abahlobo bakho ngayo!.
In the place where he lives.	Kuloo ndawo ahlala kuyo.
No one will ever know.	Akukho mntu uya kukwazi.
I want everyone to do their job.	Ndifuna wonke umntu enze umsebenzi wakhe.
You talk about it.	Uthetha kuyo.
The other thing is just his work.	Enye into ngumsebenzi wakhe nje.
I knew better now.	Bendisazi ngcono ngoku.
He wanted but could not succeed.	Wayefuna kodwa akazange akwazi ukuphumelela.
Maybe it is me.	Mhlawumbi ndim.
He built a house in this place.	Wakha indlu kule ndawo.
That happens, often.	Oko kwenzeka, rhoqo.
I don't know anyone here.	Andazi mntu apha.
That's very good.	Kulungile kakhulu.
I really deserve it.	Ndifanele ngokwenene.
But he could not wait.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukulinda.
Really, very good.	Ngokwenene, kuhle kakhulu.
Sure, that's really good.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oko kuhle ngenene.
You think one way and you feel the other way.	Ucinga ngenye indlela kwaye uziva ngenye indlela.
I'll get one.	Ndiza kufumana enye.
Really?	Ngokwenene?
We'll just take things.	Siza kuthatha nje izinto.
He just made a chance.	Wenza nje ithuba.
We will do just that anyway.	Siza kukwenza oko nangona kunjalo.
Then we will all know.	Ngelo xesha siya kukwazi sonke.
And I don't have to go there.	Kwaye akufuneki ndiye apho.
I can't stop.	Andikwazi ukuyeka.
He said he wanted to talk to us about something.	Wathi kukho into afuna ukuthetha nathi ngayo.
It's just strange to him.	Yinto nje engaqhelekanga kuye.
And then you feel good.	Kwaye ke uziva ulungile.
Not two, not three.	Hayi ezimbini, hayi ezintathu.
I did not see.	Khange ndibone.
That should have been the whole thing.	Bekufanele ukuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
Now it will be fun !!.	Ngoku kuya kuba mnandi !!.
You do not think well.	Awucingi kakuhle.
It is our job to work.	Ngumsebenzi wethu ukusebenza.
I live on the side.	Ndihlala ecaleni.
It will not be easy.	Akuyi kuba lula.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
Human being.	Ukuba ngumntu.
When do you plan to have children?	Uceba ukuba nabantwana nini?
I'm just starting to read.	Ndiyaqala ukufunda.
It happened to me a lot.	Kwenzeka kum kakhulu.
It should be fun.	Kufuneka kube mnandi.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukuthetha nawe.
That is really very difficult.	Oko ngenene kunzima kakhulu.
I always ask for more.	Ndihlala ndicela ngakumbi.
I can't tell you how it happened.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Very little.	Kakhulu kancinci.
You come to my house for dinner.	Uza apha kwam ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
It will get better.	Kuya kuba ngcono.
Just like that and.	Kanye njalo kwaye.
If not then it will be so.	Ukuba akunjalo kuya kuba njalo.
This, however, by the way.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, ngendlela.
I think that's a very good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle kakhulu.
Nobody looks like us.	Akukho mntu ubonakala ngathi.
I don't think everything is all right.	Andiqondi ukuba yonke into ilungile.
And he did not know that you did the right thing.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba wenze into elungileyo.
I thought maybe.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhlawumbi.
He wanted to go, now.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, ngoku.
Maybe you want to try something else.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuzama enye into.
This is what happens.	Le yinto eyenzekayo.
You are that.	Wena oko.
But only a few days.	Kodwa kuphela iintsuku ezimbalwa.
You are the one.	Wena nguwe.
I can think the same way.	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga ngendlela enye.
Just as it should.	Kanye njengokuba kufuneka.
It's the same thing here.	Yinto enye apha.
I hope this is better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kungcono.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
Such a beautiful book.	Incwadi entle kangaka.
It is best to arrive early.	Kungcono ukufika ngokukhawuleza.
This is a job.	Lo ngumsebenzi.
He says he knows.	Uthi uyazi.
Totally alone.	Ngokupheleleyo ndedwa.
I want to know for sure.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
We have to go anyway.	Kufuneka sihambe kunjalo.
They did not build.	Abazange bakhe.
And this is the same thing.	Kwaye le yinto enye.
And it's okay to be so.	Kwaye kulungile ukuba kube njalo.
That's right now.	Kunjalo ngoku.
And that should have been the case.	Kwaye bekufanele ukuba yiloo nto.
Now it's okay.	Ngoku ilungile.
This is not the case though.	Oku akunjalo nangona kunjalo.
Controversy over religion.	Utata udiniwe.
He's out here.	Ulapha phandle.
I will come tomorrow evening.	Ndiza kuza ngomso ngokuhlwa.
He certainly is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo unjalo.
He studied very hard.	Wafunda nzima kakhulu.
I do that just in time for me.	Ndiyenza loo nto kanye ngexesha nam.
Mother at home.	Umama ekhaya.
He is a very good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo kakhulu.
You can do it all at once.	Ungayenza yonke ngexesha elinye.
You will have to wait for someone else.	Kuya kufuneka ulinde omnye umntu.
Reading is nothing.	Ukufunda akukho nto.
Or trying to do it.	Okanye uzama ukwenza.
He seemed to love her, too.	Kwakubonakala ukuba uyamthanda, naye.
That's what it is here for.	Yiyo loo nto elapha.
It can be a very small thing.	Inokuba yinto encinci kakhulu.
It's out there though.	Kukho ngaphandle kodwa.
Please talk down more.	Nceda uthethe phantsi ngakumbi.
But you can't imagine such a thing.	Kodwa awukwazi ukucinga into enjalo.
No and go with it.	Hayi kwaye uhambe nayo.
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.
But he did not try hard.	Kodwa akazange azame ngamandla.
Just tell me.	Ndixelele nje.
But he will go first.	Kodwa uya kuqala.
Before you leave.	Ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
You will not be able to help your friends.	Awuyi kukwazi ukunceda abahlobo bakho.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa yayingenguye yedwa.
I never thought so.	Khange ndicinge njalo.
But do not forget the name.	Kodwa ungalibali igama.
Thanks for all your help !.	Enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho!.
He never did it again.	Akazange aphinde ayenze.
But for now he is a good man.	Kodwa okwangoku yindoda elungileyo.
And then we know what happened.	Kwaye ke siyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He left immediately after that.	Wemka ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
I can say that.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyithetha loo nto.
Good for him.	Kuhle kuye.
He ran away and ran away.	Wabaleka wabaleka wabaleka.
Well, there is one thing.	Kulungile, kukho into enye.
And work is work.	Kwaye umsebenzi ngumsebenzi.
He is very much like you.	Ufana nawe kakhulu.
I think we'll see what happens.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Maybe more than that.	Mhlawumbi ngaphezu koko.
Everyone else seems to be doing the same thing.	Wonke omnye umntu ubonakala esenza into efanayo.
That's right, he said.	Kunjalo, uthe.
And we will do it soon.	Kwaye siza kuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
But here's the big problem.	Kodwa apha kukho ingxaki enkulu.
But nobody will ever do that.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akukho mntu uya kukwenza oko.
And look good.	Kwaye jonga kakuhle.
Just a small problem.	Ingxaki encinci nje.
Well, maybe not, but if it can.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo, kodwa ukuba inokuba nayo.
No, it's just a thing.	Hayi, yinto nje.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi abazange.
In that case.	Xa kunjalo .
Anyone other than him.	Nabani na ngaphandle kwakhe.
Not just today.	Hayi nje namhlanje.
Not bad reading.	Hayi ukufunda kakubi.
In my house.	Endlini yam.
Well, you probably did.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi uyenzile.
I like his mind.	Ndiyayithanda ingqondo yakhe.
I hope not to you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo kuwe.
Maybe you're interested.	Mhlawumbi unomdla.
But this is very good.	Kodwa oku kulungile kakhulu.
I'm not sure how long this will take.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kuthatha ixesha elingakanani le nto.
Then she started to sing.	Waza waqalisa ukucula.
By the way.	Ngendlela.
I really want to try.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuzama.
I thought about it too.	Nam bendicinga ngayo.
I think the other way.	Ndicinga ngenye indlela.
You told him it happened.	Umxelele ukuba kwenzeke.
High, but long.	Phezulu, kodwa ixesha elide.
He did a great job with it.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle ngayo.
Some people not so much.	Abanye abantu hayi kakhulu.
He did not know anything about it until recently.	Wayengazi nto ngayo de kube mva nje.
Let me think.	Makhe ndicinge.
You can not read this.	Awukwazi ukufunda oku.
And how you want to stay there.	Kwaye ufuna ukuhlala njani apho.
Thank you for dinner.	Enkosi ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
Don't forget to do it again.	Ungalibali ukwenza kwakhona.
I don't know which one.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi.
I wanted to tell you.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela.
This has not been a big deal.	Oku akuzange kube yinto enkulu.
Only it is not easy.	Kuphela akukho lula.
His mother knew.	Umama wakhe wayesazi.
He felt better.	Waziva engcono.
Everything is better for us.	Konke kungcono kuthi.
I think here.	Ndicinga apha.
You should tell him that.	Ufanele umxelele loo nto.
I have no answer yet.	Andinayo impendulo okwangoku.
Yes, that means today.	Ewe, oko kuthetha ukuba namhlanje.
But rather.	Kodwa kungcono.
Tell me the whole story.	Ndixelele lonke ibali.
I got to work.	Ndifike emsebenzini.
This is the case.	Oku kunjalo.
Well, he didn't seem to want much.	Kulungile, akazange abonakale efuna into eninzi.
And you did not know.	Kwaye ubungazi.
One word.	Igama elinye.
It shouldn't have been the case.	Bekungafanelanga nokuba kunjalo.
You read fast.	Ufunda ngokukhawuleza.
I do not know how long.	Andazi ukuba kude kube nini.
Or my job.	Okanye umsebenzi wam.
He thought it would be painful.	Wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba buhlungu.
And then nothing all day.	Kwaye ke akukho nto yonke imini.
He thought he must be happy.	Wayecinga ukuba umele ukuba uyavuya.
I wanted it to happen.	Bendifuna ukuba yenzeke.
We have never had this before.	Asizange sibe nayo le nto ngaphambili.
But he did not succeed completely.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele ngokupheleleyo.
I want to go to college.	Ndifuna ukuya ekholejini.
Lots of waiting.	Ukulinda okuninzi.
And it is difficult to achieve that.	Kwaye kunzima ukuphumelela ngolo hlobo.
And that's a good thing.	Kwaye yinto entle leyo.
And he will be.	Kwaye uya kuba njalo.
I know it's not me.	Ndiyazi ukuba ayindim.
Very, very good.	Kakhulu, kuhle kakhulu.
I would like to help.	Ndingathanda ukunceda.
I would like to do the same.	Ndingathanda ukwenza ngendlela efanayo.
We don't have to do that here.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo apha.
Please tell me it isn't.	Nceda undixelele ukuba akunjalo.
I didn't know that, till now.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto, kude kube ngoku.
Not just my job.	Hayi nje umsebenzi wam.
You do not have to think anything.	Akufunekanga ucinge nantoni na.
He stayed with me.	Wahlala nam.
He spent the night.	Wachitha ubusuku.
I'm happy for him.	Ndiyavuya ngaye.
I just wanted a dog.	Ndandifuna nje inja.
We do not have to make it harder.	Akufunekanga ukuba siyenze nzima ngakumbi.
Although he will not be.	Nangona akayi kuba.
I don't want him to come.	Andifuni ukuba eze.
Here it is to stay.	Nantso apha ukuhlala.
He wanted to stay out.	Wayefuna ukuhlala ngaphandle.
You know, a very good thing.	Uyazi, into entle kakhulu.
And so, but it is hard to find.	Kwaye ke, kodwa kunzima ukufumana.
Hours he walked into his office.	Iiyure wangena eofisini yakhe.
I think he is too.	Ndicinga ukuba naye unjalo.
Here, it was not.	Apha, kwakungekho.
Now you know why.	Ngoku uyasazi isizathu.
However, enough for now.	Nangona kunjalo, ngokwaneleyo okwangoku.
I think there is a mistake here.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho impazamo apha.
Thank you, thank you, thank you !.	Enkosi, enkosi, enkosi!.
You should not make the same mistake.	Akufanele wenze impazamo efanayo.
Soon he could not.	Kungekudala akazange akwazi.
I will go, if you want me to go.	Ndiya kuhamba, ukuba uyafuna ndihambe.
Not me but.	Hayi mna kodwa.
I want to be here.	Ndifuna ukuba lapha.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
However, it is not very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nzima kakhulu.
I'm afraid this is it.	Ndiyoyika ukuba yiyo le.
Once there is a problem.	Kanye xa kukho ingxaki.
I read a lot.	Ndifunde kakhulu.
I think they will.	Ndicinga ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
Back.	Ngasemva.
But here, there is none.	Kodwa apha, akukho.
He walked into the classroom.	Wangena eklasini.
However, there is an error.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho impazamo.
Then the dog.	Emva koko inja.
You said you had a problem.	Ubuthe unengxaki.
That's his mind.	Ingqondo yakhe leyo.
He went back to his lunch.	Wabuyela kwisidlo sakhe sasemini.
And you will get better, too.	Kwaye uya kuba ngcono, nawe.
You better go with me.	Kungcono uhambe nam.
This is good enough.	Oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
Don't think of anything else.	Musa ukucinga ngenye into.
It will be necessary.	Kuya kufuneka.
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
He is only human.	Ungumntu kuphela.
This one may be making time.	Lo usenokuba wenza ixesha.
You can do it with your children.	Ungayenza kunye nabantwana bakho.
He did not want everyone to know who he was.	Wayengafuni ukuba wonke umntu azi ngaye.
I had to stay.	Kwafuneka ndihlale.
The dog is out.	Inja nje.
A better person does something faster.	Umntu ongcono enze into ngokukhawuleza.
The answer is correct.	Impendulo ilungile.
We will talk about it tomorrow.	Siza kuthetha ngayo ngomso.
That will happen, that will happen.	Oko kuya kwenzeka, oko kuya kwenzeka.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Wonke umntu wathetha ngayo, kodwa akukho mntu wenza nto.
She saw it, but she did not tell him.	Wabona, kodwa akazange amxelele.
Not entirely so.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo kunjalo.
Not so but.	Akunjalo kodwa.
Dinner with friends.	Isidlo kunye nabahlobo.
You have to do that.	Kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
To help, it seems to us.	Ukunceda, kubonakala ngathi.
I hope it happens soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
It should not happen that way.	Akufanele kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
Where is my problem.	Iphi ingxaki yam.
You eat almost everything.	Utya phantse yonke into.
You like it up here.	Uyayithanda apha phezulu.
But we will be there because of him.	Kodwa siya kuba lapho ngenxa yakhe.
Well done !.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu!.
You have to have that.	Kufuneka ube nayo loo nto.
He was supposed to come in tomorrow.	Bekufanele angene ngomso.
But he didn't, for now.	Kodwa akazange akwazi, okwangoku.
I know you are there.	Ndiyazi ukuba ukhona.
Not too far away, but far enough.	Hayi kude kakhulu, kodwa kude ngokwaneleyo.
I told her.	Ndamxelela.
Where are we going.	Apho siya khona.
There is only up or down.	Kukho kuphela phezulu okanye phantsi.
Or make music.	Okanye wenze umculo.
I do not like this method.	Andiyithandi le ndlela.
He did not want to.	Akazange afune.
He did not enter.	Akazange angene.
Clearly, he is not a person.	Kucacile ukuba akangomntu.
Then he looked at his daughter.	Emva koko wajonga intombi yakhe.
But we do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba senze njalo.
He feels like us.	Uziva ngathi.
I know.	Ndiyazi.
This he would not do.	Le nto wayengayi kuyenza.
Nobody has it.	Akukho mntu unayo.
You know, of course.	Uyazi, kunjalo.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I'll be here for two hours.	Ndiza kuba apha iiyure ezimbini.
That's it again, he thought.	Nantso kwakhona, wacinga.
This is not possible.	Akunakwenzeka oku.
I want to know everything about him.	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into ngaye.
It is simply not possible.	Akunakwenzeka nje.
Probably, a little bit.	Mhlawumbi, kancinci.
Or he should not have had it.	Okanye bekungafanelanga ukuba abe nayo.
He fell asleep immediately and fell asleep immediately.	Walala kwangoko walala ngoko nangoko.
I made a story.	Ndenze ibali.
He knows nothing, it seems to us.	Akazi nto, kubonakala ngathi.
But he did not think about it.	Kodwa akazange acinge ngale nto.
But do not say or do anything.	Kodwa musa ukuthetha okanye wenze nantoni na.
I didn't tell him much.	Khange ndimxelele kakhulu.
We just have to be in it.	Kufuneka nje sibe kuyo.
Give me everything.	Ndinike yonke into.
Have you ever been to this place?	Ngaba ukhe waya kule ndawo?
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekileyo apha.
This did not happen.	Oku akuzange kube njalo.
Or he certainly appeared.	Okanye ngokuqinisekileyo wabonakala.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ndandingafuni ukubona mntu.
But she could not restrain herself.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
Bedtime!	Ixesha lokulala!
I would like to know what is going on.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Then he could not.	Emva koko akazange akwazi.
Let me talk to her.	Makhe ndithethe naye.
I would like to know why.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
It will do it again.	Iza kwenza kwakhona.
And it's good for me.	Kwaye kuhle kum.
Not just, man.	Hayi nje, mntu.
Maybe it should.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele.
And there is her son.	Kwaye kukho unyana wakhe.
Not in this case.	Hayi kule meko.
In his house.	Endlini yakhe .
Do not try to make peace.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza uxolo.
He came and sat next to me.	Ufike wahlala ecaleni kwam.
And, there is a lot of truth to that.	Kwaye, kukho inyaniso eninzi kuloo nto.
In his house but not in his bed.	Endlini yakhe kodwa hayi ebhedini yakhe.
This has been great.	Oku kube kuhle.
We have to go fast.	Sifanele sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
Thank you for doing a great job with this.	Enkosi ngokwenza umsebenzi omkhulu ngale nto.
Well done!	Uhambe kakuhle kakhulu!
I'm not good at it.	Andikho mhle kuyo.
He went down once.	Wehla kanye.
I don't have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndiyenze le nto.
The sooner it gets better, though.	Ngokukhawuleza kungcono, nangona kunjalo.
He was too scared to swim.	Wayesoyika kakhulu ukuqubha.
I never tried.	Zange azame.
It happened last week.	Kwenzeke kwiveki ephelileyo.
He came to me.	Uye weza kum.
Fast, and very fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, kwaye kakhulu.
I'll find another way.	Ndiza kufumana enye indlela.
Not for us, of course.	Hayi kuthi, kunjalo.
Not in a positive or negative way.	Hayi ngendlela elungileyo okanye embi.
And nothing goes.	Kwaye akukho nto iya.
Not you.	Hayi nawe.
It would be a good thing to do it.	Bekuya kuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
He thought he knew.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
Not long enough.	Kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
And more than you.	Kwaye ngaphezu kwakho.
Everyone looked at me to make a decision.	Wonke umntu wajonga kum ukuba enze isigqibo.
It's okay with us.	Kulungile nathi.
Nobody goes there today.	Akukho mntu uya apho namhlanje.
He asked me something.	Wandicela into.
You must be tired.	Umele ukuba udiniwe.
Then, one more correct answer.	Emva koko, enye impendulo ilungile.
I just wanted to go to her house.	Bendifuna nje ukuya kuye endlini.
Not up, not down.	Hayi phezulu, hayi phantsi.
I'm glad you're better.	Ndiyavuya ungcono.
Only please go.	Kuphela ndicela uhambe.
I don't know why, it's just that.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kunjalo nje.
Then some stayed.	Bahlala ke abanye.
He can't walk well.	Akakwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ndandingazi ukuba kukho into enjalo.
We will have to do two.	Kuya kufuneka senze ezimbini.
Okay, so it looks okay.	Kulungile, ngoko kubonakala kulungile.
He will be doing a lot of things today.	Uzakuba esenza izinto ezininzi namhlanje.
He works hard every day.	Usebenza nzima yonke imihla.
Obviously, there is a big but.	Ngokucacileyo, kukho enkulu kodwa.
You have to come.	Kufuneka uze.
One, he works very hard all the time.	Enye, usebenza nzima kakhulu ngalo lonke ixesha.
He ate his lunch alone.	Watya isidlo sakhe sasemini yedwa.
One big job.	Umsebenzi omnye omkhulu.
He will move slowly.	Uya kuhamba kancinci.
But it seems okay.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile.
But there are times.	Kodwa kukho amaxesha.
She is beautiful.	Mhle.
What place is this?	Yeyiphi indawo le?
I'd better go too.	Kungcono nam ndihambe.
But it is very difficult for me.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu kum.
But, he went on, this is not really the case.	Kodwa, waqhubeka, oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
I couldn’t do it, though.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza, nangona kunjalo.
I want to know what happened there.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho.
It makes the job very difficult.	Kwenza ukuba umsebenzi ube nzima kakhulu.
I don't know what's going on.	Andazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I didn't tell her the whole story.	Khange ndimxelele lonke ibali.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Ndiqinisekile uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
She came to me right away.	Uye weza kum ngoko nangoko.
At bedtime.	Ngexesha lokulala.
That's a good thing.	Yinto elungileyo.
He made peace with it.	Wenze uxolo ngayo.
Now, it's not that easy.	Ngoku, akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
You would not know anyone here.	Ubungazi mntu apha.
So here it is.	Ngoko ke lo.
Getting there, but for now.	Ukufika apho, kodwa okwangoku.
I want to know what happened next.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
A little more.	Kancinci ngakumbi.
If you have time.	Ukuba unexesha.
Don't talk to me.	Musa ukuthetha kum.
He looked at it.	Wajonga kuyo.
How to live alone.	Indlela yokuhlala ndedwa.
What are you going to do?	Uza kwenza ntoni?
There is something very wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga ncam.
Great thing.	Into enkulu.
You can't talk to him.	Awukwazi ukuthetha naye.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
Like, that's the way it is.	Njengokuba, yiloo ndlela.
Can someone please do that.	Ngaba umntu nceda enze oko.
That, more so.	Oko, ngakumbi.
I do not remember why.	Andikhumbuli ukuba kutheni.
Give me a chance.	Ndinike ithuba.
He said .	Uthe .
But now it is done.	Kodwa ngoku yenziwe.
My son is there.	Unyana wam ukhona.
Why is that.	Kutheni kunjalo nje.
This will not be difficult for me.	Oku akuyi kuba nzima kum.
He started driving.	Waqalisa ukuqhuba.
Maybe it's good for me in a way.	Mhlawumbi kuhle kum ngendlela.
I don't want to do it here.	Andifuni ukuyenza apha.
Or children.	Okanye abantwana.
Doing something is something.	Ukwenza into yinto.
He would like to take a message.	Angathanda ukuthatha umyalezo.
There was no reason for that.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba.
I'm looking forward to that.	Ndijonge phambili kuloo nto.
Not one time.	Akukho xesha elinye.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Bendingazi ukuba ndenze njani namhlanje.
How long is this.	Ixesha elingakanani oku.
Any way to do this ?.	Nayiphi na indlela yokwenza oku?.
He does not know where he is going.	Akakwazi apho uya khona.
By work, or whatever.	Ngomsebenzi, okanye nantoni na.
He did it in an unusual way.	Wenza ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
He has to be with her.	Kufuneka abe naye.
Now he was gone.	Ngoku wayengekho.
What would you like to do?	Ingaba ungathanda ukwenza ntoni?
You know why it did.	Uyazi ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo.
I don't even know why.	Andazi nokuba kutheni.
You need my help.	Ufuna uncedo lwam.
Well that won't do it.	Kulungile oko akuyi kwenza.
Tell me why you want it that way.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni ufuna njalo.
He does not know where you live.	Akakwazi apho uhlala khona.
No, no problem.	Hayi, akukho ngxaki.
I will not do that.	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
There is no one in the car.	Akukho mntu emotweni.
He agreed to try.	Wavuma ukuzama.
I don't know what you want.	Andiqondi ukuba ufuna ntoni.
Well, maybe not so much.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.
I just want you to think about this with me.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ucinge ngale nto kunye nam.
He had to stay in the hospital for a few weeks.	Kwafuneka ahlale esibhedlele iiveki ezimbalwa.
That's a lot.	Yinto eninzi.
And she loves him.	Kwaye uyamthanda.
Pleased to meet you.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi.
That's my problem.	Nantso ingxaki yam.
My son.	Unyana wam.
She looked up and down.	Ujonge phantsi phezulu.
Well, nothing seems to have happened.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi akukho nto yenzekileyo.
I don't know what happened to you.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuwe.
Much more.	Kakhulu ngakumbi.
That's the way it is today.	Kunjalo namhlanje.
I can't help it.	Andikwazi ukunceda.
You know, nothing.	Uyazi, akukho nto.
It makes it hard to finish anything.	Kwenza kube nzima ukugqiba nantoni na.
I knew we would be together again.	Ndandisazi ukuba siza kuba kunye kwakhona.
Well, you can do just that.	Ewe, ungayenza kanye loo nto.
I want to be me.	Ndifuna ukuba ndim.
It is not easy to stay here.	Akukho lula ukuhlala apha.
Please think about that.	Nceda ucinge ngaloo nto.
I can't go any further.	Andikwazi ukuya ngaphezu koko.
Everyone stayed, except me.	Wonke umntu wahlala, ngaphandle kwam.
I like that in the morning.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto kusasa.
I never went to that place.	Andizange ndiye kuloo ndawo.
I'm going there.	Ndiya phaya.
There are times when you.	Kukho amaxesha apho wena.
I will go to him.	Ndiya kuya kuye.
How do you do it.	Uyenza njani.
By doing this.	Ngokwenza oku.
That's what he did.	Nto leyo ayenzileyo.
Why now ?.	Kutheni ngoku?.
I do not know where you are.	Andazi ukuba uphi.
This is for you first.	Oku kuwe kuqala.
I thought you knew that, too.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto, nawe.
Or my mother.	Okanye umama wam.
I should be even angrier, maybe.	Ndifanele ukuba nomsindo ngakumbi, mhlawumbi.
I will never do it again.	Soze ndiphinde.
So he finally left.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni wemka.
Yes, almost everything.	Ewe, phantse yonke into.
I hope I will be beautiful one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiya kuba mhle ngenye imini.
But this time.	Kodwa ngeli xesha.
A little something for me.	Into encinci kum.
But this is clear.	Kodwa oku kucacile.
Finally he appeared.	Ekugqibeleni wabonakala.
I wanted that.	Ndandifuna oko.
He wanted to know the time.	Wayefuna ukwazi ixesha.
There are a lot of people out there.	Kukho abantu abaninzi phaya.
I looked down at my mother.	Ndijonge phantsi umama.
We will definitely be back !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kubuya!.
She has lived alone ever since.	Uhlala yedwa ukusukela ngoko.
To know that you are here.	Ukwazi ukuba ulapha.
Now it's done.	Ngoku yenziwe.
He did anything.	Wenze nantoni na.
I try to help.	Ndizama ukunceda.
Not so good.	Akukho kuhle kakhulu.
I don't like you, not really.	Andikuthandi, hayi ngokwenene.
That seems obvious to me.	Oko kubonakala kucacile kum.
Okay there now.	Kulungile apho ngoku.
They live together anyway.	Bahlala kunye kunjalo.
This is where they live.	Kule ndawo bahlala kuyo.
It works well.	Usebenza kakuhle.
I just want someone here for me.	Ndifuna nje umntu apha kum.
I want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi.
So it seems to us.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi.
I can't think of one bad thing.	Andikwazi ukucinga into enye embi.
Again, far from it.	Kwakhona, kude kuyo.
If you are sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile.
This will happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokwenene.
Not so with money.	Akunjalo ngemali.
He is afraid of everything.	Woyika yonke into.
After all, probably no one.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi akukho mntu.
But it is a good thing to do.	Kodwa yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
And then you know what you want to do.	Kwaye ke uyazi into ofuna ukuyenza.
He asked me to stay inside the restaurant.	Wandicela ukuba ndihlale ngaphakathi kwindawo yokutyela.
You will not have to do this alone.	Akuyi kufuneka wenze oku wedwa.
Everything, but one thing.	Konke, kodwa enye into.
Not so at this time.	Akunjalo ngeli xesha.
But it will happen.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka.
It would be doing the right thing.	Bekuya kuba kukwenza into elungileyo.
Everyone should eat.	Wonke umntu kufuneka atye.
He is not in it.	Akakho kuyo.
He says he does.	Uthi uyayenza.
So, finally.	Ngoko, ekugqibeleni.
Because he did something wrong.	Kuba wenze into engalunganga.
Look at that.	Jonga loo nto.
You love, you love, you love.	Uyathanda, uyathanda, uyathanda.
This makes it very difficult to stop.	Oku kwenza kube nzima kakhulu ukuyeka.
i am going to town.	ndiya edolophini.
If you think you will get better, then you will.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba uya kuba ngcono, ngoko uya kuba njalo.
He thought he was asleep.	Wayecinga ukuba ulele.
I don't see why.	Andiboni ukuba kutheni.
He only knew he had to try.	Wayesazi kuphela ukuba kufuneka azame.
Exactly.	Yona kanye.
It will mean that you did it on time.	Kuya kuthetha ukuba uyenzile ngexesha.
But there is a place.	Kodwa kukho indawo.
He walked in front of me a little.	Wahamba phambi kwam kancinci.
I can't wait to see what to buy.	Andikwazi kulinda ukubona ukuba kukho ntoni na ukuthenga.
And now I look.	Ke ngoku ndijonge.
He was always there.	Wayehlala njalo njalo.
What will you get for breakfast?	Uza kufumana ntoni isidlo sakusasa?
And they stay that way all the time.	Kwaye bahlala ngaloo ndlela lonke ixesha.
All is well.	Konke kulungile.
Not until you told him.	Hayi de wamxelela.
Only his eyes.	Amehlo akhe kuphela.
Not so much and not so much.	Hayi kakhulu hayi ngakumbi.
You have to come here.	Kufuneka uze apha.
He doesn't know what he wants to do.	Akayazi into afuna ukuyenza.
He opened the door and looked inside.	Wavula ucango wajonga ngaphakathi.
He saw.	Wabona.
He did many things for me.	Wenza izinto ezininzi kum.
Not now late.	Hayi ngoku late.
He goes this way in a completely wrong way.	Uhamba ngale ndlela ngendlela engalunganga ngokupheleleyo.
Food is even harder.	Ukutya kunzima ngakumbi.
I want to learn more about it.	Ndifuna ukufunda ngakumbi ngayo.
Probably more than anyone.	Mhlawumbi ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
Nothing will happen to me.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka kum.
Because it would make everyone think.	Kuba bekuya kwenza wonke umntu acinge.
Not for a month.	Hayi kwinyanga.
Sorry, to do this but.	Uxolo, ukwenza oku kodwa.
I'll tell her this afternoon.	Ndiza kumxelela ngale njikalanga.
And now we know.	Ke ngoku siyazi.
We want to do the right thing.	Sifuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
And there it is.	Kwaye nantso.
You told me about you.	Undixelele ngawe.
They will be coming soon.	Baza kufika kungekudala.
And it will not be easy.	Kwaye akuyi kuba lula.
Everything seems fine to me.	Konke kubonakala kulungile kum.
Really, well.	Ngokwenene, kakuhle.
I just read it fast.	Ndifunde nje ngokukhawuleza.
Look again.	Jonga kwaye.
He requested a meeting.	Wacela intlanganiso.
I hope they will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
That never happened to me.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto kum.
Not good, probably.	Hayi kulungile, mhlawumbi.
It was nothing but.	Kwakungekho nto kodwa.
He said he would like to be better.	Wathi angathanda ukuba ngcono.
Otherwise, it will be fine.	Ngaphandle koko, kuya kuba kuhle.
There is a cat in my room.	Kukho ikati kwigumbi lam.
He did not really know how long it would last.	Wayengazi ngokwenene ukuba kude kube nini.
I totally do this.	Ndiyenza ngokupheleleyo le nto.
I did not see him.	Khange ndimbone.
You would be making a big mistake.	Uya kuba wenza impazamo enkulu.
I never got anywhere.	Andizange ndifike ndawo.
I would like better.	Ndingathanda ngcono.
So he finally fell asleep.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni walala.
I'll go with you, if you want to.	Ndiza kuhamba nawe, ukuba ufuna njalo.
I know, it's a bad problem to have.	Ndiyazi, ingxaki embi ukuba nayo.
John built a new house.	UJohn wakha indlu entsha.
And he thought everything was fine.	Kwaye wayecinga ukuba konke kulungile.
He wanted to make peace.	Wayefuna ukwenza uxolo.
Life is work.	Ubomi ngumsebenzi.
Once again maybe.	Kanye kwakhona mhlawumbi.
He will surely stay there again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala apho kwakhona.
You have to look.	Kufuneka ujonge.
Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini.
Unless it is true.	Ngaphandle kokuba yinyani.
He made his decision.	Wenze isigqibo sakhe.
We'll talk.	Siza kuthetha.
Sorry no thank you.	Uxolo hayi enkosi.
Do you have any questions?	Ngaba unayo nayiphi na imibuzo?
Everyone said he was.	Wonke umntu wathi nguye.
He never said that.	Zange athethe ngolo hlobo.
I'm waiting for the car.	Ndilinde emotweni.
Or if not.	Okanye ukuba akukho.
He wants to know how.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba njani.
He walked slowly into the house.	Wahamba kancinci endlini.
And he didn't want to be that way.	Kwaye wayengafuni ukuba njalo.
It would be very easy.	Bekuya kuba lula kakhulu.
I have to think things through, in order to make a decision.	Kufuneka ndicinge izinto kakuhle, ukuze ndenze isigqibo.
Then and where and.	Emva koko kwaye phi kwaye.
However, this is not the case here.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo apha.
So much for this.	Kakhulu ngolu hlobo.
We'll see, though.	Siza kubona, nangona kunjalo.
You made a mistake.	Wenze impazamo.
He can't walk now.	Akakwazi ukuhamba ngoku.
He took three.	Wathatha ezintathu.
I saw something big.	Ndabona ukuba kukho into enkulu.
Later, when he found his place.	Kamva, xa wafumana indawo yakhe.
It's time again.	Lixesha kwakhona.
Clearly, it has to be.	Ngokucacileyo, kufuneka kube njalo.
It is impossible to say.	Akunakwenzeka ukuthetha.
I would probably.	Ndingathanda mhlawumbi.
Let me tell you something.	Makhe ndikuxelele into.
Just a little bit.	Kancinci nje.
I know you can do it.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza.
And she really loves this person.	Kwaye uyamthanda nyani lo mntu.
Then he pulled out another one.	Emva koko wakhupha enye.
He said he felt much better.	Wathi uziva engcono kakhulu.
I'm not sure what happened, of course.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni, kunjalo.
I did something wrong.	Ndenza into embi.
And not a little bit.	Kwaye hayi kancinci.
I wanted to know, to see.	Bendifuna ukwazi, ukubona.
He looks very bad now.	Ukhangeleka embi kakhulu ngoku.
In this case, everything is fine.	Kule meko, yonke into ilungile.
Is everything all right?	Ngaba yonke into ilungile?
He looked very bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi kakhulu.
This is new.	Le entsha.
Not so much, really.	Hayi kakhulu, ngokwenene.
This food.	Oku kutya.
Inside looking out or out looking inward.	Ngaphakathi ujonge ngaphandle okanye ngaphandle ujonge ngaphakathi.
In our time.	Ngexesha lethu.
He has become.	Uye waba.
But he must be alone.	Kodwa kufuneka abe yedwa.
I want everything done right.	Ndifuna yonke into yenziwe ngendlela.
It affects everyone and not just you.	Kwenza kuye wonke umntu hayi kuwe kuphela.
I don’t know if you have it or not.	Andazi ukuba unayo okanye hayi.
He spoke at length about his work.	Wathetha ixesha elide ngomsebenzi wakhe.
I think that means no.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuthetha ukuba akukho.
You know it well.	Wazi kakuhle.
He wanted permission.	Wayefuna imvume.
This is great but he did it.	Oku kakhulu kodwa wakwenza.
I never thought about it.	Khange ndicinge ngayo.
He was not far off wrong.	Wayengekho kude engalunganga.
He really did not know.	Ngokwenene wayengazi.
We will definitely come back anyway.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kubuya nangona kunjalo.
That, of course, is a big deal.	Oko, kunjalo, yinto enkulu.
So, no one is talking to him.	Ngoko, akukho mntu uthetha naye.
He said.	Uthe.
He wanted to try again.	Wayefuna ukuzama kwakhona.
I'm trying to think of something.	Ndizama ukucinga ngento ethile.
I want you here too.	Ndifuna nawe apha.
But I'm not sure.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga.
The gun is the same thing.	Umpu yinto enye.
He hoped it wasn't.	Wayenethemba lokuba yayingenguye.
Are you sleeping well tonight?	Ngaba ulele kakuhle namhlanje ebusuku?
For that would not be good.	Kuba oko akuyi kuba kuhle.
That's perfectly fine.	Oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
He is here now.	Ukhona ngoku.
If not, you do not want to.	Ukuba akunjalo, awufuni.
I will come here tomorrow.	Ndiza kuza apha ngomso.
I will try harder.	Ndiza kuzama kakhulu.
He was the one who said everything.	Lowo wayethetha yonke into.
Isn't it really.	Ngaba asiyonto ngenene.
No, he will not come in again.	Hayi, akasayi kuphinda angene.
Not all of us.	Akunjalo sonke.
And yet he knew about it.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo wayesazi ngayo.
So how do you do it.	Ngoko ukwenza njani.
Obviously something bad happened.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into embi eyenzekileyo.
This is better.	Oku kungcono.
As you go.	Njengoko uhamba.
People will continue.	Abantu baya kuqhubeka.
That will come later.	Oko kuya kuza kamva.
It takes too long.	Kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
He said help me, help me.	Wathi ndincede, ndincede.
He is not at home.	Akakho ekhaya.
He did that.	Wayenza loo nto.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
At that time, it will be.	Ngelo xesha, kuya kuba njalo.
I heard that there was a problem coming.	Ndeva ukuba kukho ingxaki ezayo.
But how do you do that?	Kodwa uyenza njani loo nto.
He hoped they would come for dinner.	Wayenethemba lokuba baza kuza isidlo.
But he did not stay there long.	Kodwa akazange ahlale ixesha elide apho.
Everyone knows that a lot.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba kakhulu.
We all need to do better.	Sonke kufuneka senze ngcono.
And well, really.	Kwaye kulungile, ngokwenene.
Because you do not know what will happen next.	Kuba awuyazi into eza kwenzeka.
I never got home.	Andizange ndifike ekhaya.
No problem finding a place.	Akukho ngxaki ukufumana indawo.
And now is the time.	Kwaye ngoku lixesha.
I would like to stay here again.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apha kwakhona.
We'll see how this goes.	Siza kubona ukuba oku kuhamba njani.
No, no problem here.	Hayi, akukho ngxaki apha.
I haven't heard of you yet.	Andizange ndeva ngawe nangoku.
Well, that's it.	Kulungile, yiloo nto.
I mean anything.	Ndithetha nantoni na.
This is for him.	Oku kuye .
Is true.	Yinyani.
And now he wants to go home.	Kwaye ngoku ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
He says he is very happy to meet you.	Uthi uyavuya kakhulu ukudibana nawe.
Maybe they will come.	Mhlawumbi baya kuza.
And now, you love it.	Kwaye ngoku, uyayithanda.
Not so though.	Akunjalo nangona.
Now help me here.	Ngoku ndincede apha.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Kufuneka siye emsebenzini ngomso.
See you tomorrow.	Ndiza kubona ngomso.
There is just one.	Kukho nje enye.
I would really like to help others.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukunceda abanye.
You just know.	Uyazi nje.
No, it's not there.	Hayi, akukho apho.
I think he is.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Wathi akazi nto ngayo.
He knew it was going to happen.	Wayesazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Please go here.	Nceda uye apha.
Happy to help.	Ndiyavuya ukunceda.
I would like to see something else.	Ndingathanda ukubona enye into.
I would like to talk to you today if you are available.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe namhlanje ukuba ukhona.
I waited for him to say something.	Ndilinde ukuba athethe into.
Everyone ran everywhere.	Wonke umntu wabaleka yonke indawo.
So don't be around.	Ngoko musa ukuba malunga.
It could be better though.	Inokuba ngcono nangona.
But at night.	Kodwa ebusuku.
Or maybe everyone felt it.	Okanye ke wonke umntu waziva.
All right then.	Kulungile ngoko.
Looking up.	Ujonge phezulu.
And it all comes quickly.	Kwaye konke kuza ngokukhawuleza.
That really needs attention.	Oko ngokwenene kufuna ingqalelo.
Because there is another.	Kuba kukho enye.
Just one place.	Indawo enye nje.
Unless we need your help.	Ngaphandle kokuba sifuna uncedo lwakho.
I do not understand very well.	Andiqondi kakuhle.
I hope you don't have to come here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba uze apha.
Coming to this place.	Ukuza kule ndawo.
And it's just fine.	Kwaye kuhle nje.
Where.	Kule.
Other things.	Ezinye izinto.
Hard, yes.	Kunzima, ewe.
Everyone wanted it to be that way.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuba kube njalo.
Look up the word.	Jonga phezulu igama.
Not just you and me.	Hayi mna nawe kuphela.
That time.	Elo xesha.
Don't say it.	Musa ukuyithetha.
And it was so.	Waba njalo ke.
This is our only job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wethu kuphela.
Someone is looking down.	Umntu ujonge phantsi.
She started singing.	Waqalisa ukucula.
I think you did, too.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo, nawe.
At first no one was there.	Ekuqaleni kwakungekho mntu apho.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze izinto.
Or he did it for us.	Okanye wenza ngathi.
He found the man.	Wafumana umntu lowo.
Much more.	Okuninzi ngakumbi.
I have to think.	Kufuneka ndicinge.
Slightly it didn't hurt.	Kancinci akuzange kube buhlungu.
I'm sorry to be late.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokuba late.
I went to my room.	Ndaya egumbini lam.
Then you will get your answer.	Emva koko uya kufumana impendulo yakho.
New and unusual.	Entsha kwaye engaqhelekanga.
I just don’t know how I made it so.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani ukuba kube njalo.
Being here now.	Ukuba lapha ngoku.
Or he will return.	Okanye uya kubuya.
Then he realized that his mother was nowhere to be found.	Emva koko waqonda ukuba umama wakhe akakho ndawo.
I'm here first!	Ndilapha kuqala!
He knew now.	Wayesazi ngoku.
I told her that too.	Nam ndamxelela lonto.
Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
And that's all about it.	Kwaye yiloo nto yonke malunga nayo.
But not a car.	Kodwa hayi imoto.
You never knew.	Zange wazi.
Yes, yes, yes.	Ewe, ewe, ewe.
He asked for food right away.	Wacela ukutya ngoko nangoko.
Not for me.	Hayi ngenxa yam.
I can speak to him well now.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha naye kakuhle ngoku.
Every so often.	Rhoqo.
He was not thinking for sure.	Wayengacingi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Unless someone has told him.	Ngaphandle kokuba umntu umxelele.
I can work on it.	Ndiyakwazi ukusebenza kuyo.
He does so now.	Wenza njalo ngoku.
My children really.	Abantwana bam nyani.
And this is what happens.	Yiloo nto ke eyenzekayo.
That would be really nice.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle ngokwenene.
That's it.	Nantso ke .
And each other.	Kwaye omnye komnye.
He is a great man.	Ungumntu omkhulu.
He intends to paint a beautiful picture.	Uzimisele ukwenza umfanekiso omhle.
That's fine for now.	Ilungile loo nto okwangoku.
It doesn't have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba abe.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
Exactly.	Kanye kanye.
My gift to you is a baby.	Isipho sam kuwe ngumntwana.
Then he did.	Emva koko wenza.
Any problem, that's it.	Nayiphi na ingxaki, yiloo nto.
Or anything else about that.	Okanye nayiphi na enye into ngaloo nto.
We did it once in a while.	Senze kanye ngexesha.
But one came out.	Kodwa omnye waphuma.
Just my name.	Igama lam nje.
I will not do it again.	Andiyi kuyenza kwakhona.
She's just trying to be beautiful.	Uzama nje ukuba mhle.
I thought you had it.	Ndandicinga ukuba unayo.
I need help.	Ndifuna uncedo.
I wanted to talk more.	Ndandifuna ukuthetha ngakumbi.
It will be very fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
He left the house immediately.	Waphuma kwangoko endlwini.
If you want to be.	Ukuba ufuna ukuba.
He looks and looks very good.	Ukhangeleka kwaye ukhangeleka kakuhle kakhulu.
Everything with you is something new.	Yonke into kunye nawe yinto entsha.
And yet, it was not that easy.	Kwaye kunjalo, kwakungekho lula ngolo hlobo.
But that's the old one.	Kodwa ke leyo endala.
She never told me anyone.	Zange andixelele bani.
He almost ran away.	Uphantse wabaleka.
There is nothing in this case yet.	Akukho nto kule meko okwangoku.
I'd better go with you.	Ngcono ndihambe nawe.
He said he did his best.	Wathi wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I forgot his name.	Ndilibele igama lakhe.
I never was, not really.	Andizange ndibe, hayi ngokwenene.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi njani.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
It's hard to be high.	Kunzima ukuba phezulu.
You need help urgently.	Ufuna uncedo ngokukhawuleza.
This is the first.	Oku kuqala.
Then you will see.	Emva koko uya kubona.
Just this situation.	Kanye le meko.
We built something unusual together.	Sakhe into engaqhelekanga kunye.
I know how you feel now.	Ndiyazi ukuba uziva njani ngoku.
We did it once.	Senze kanye.
And he is here with us.	Kwaye ulapha kunye nathi.
And there is another place.	Kwaye kukho enye indawo.
I would like to make friends.	Ndingathanda ukwenza abahlobo.
It's just something that happened.	Yinto nje eyenzekileyo.
I've never been to it before.	Andizange ndiye kuyo ngaphambili.
And then? 	Ke ngoku?
Maybe again.	Mhlawumbi kwakhona.
I thought quickly.	Ndacinga ngokukhawuleza.
And he will go.	Kwaye uya kuhamba.
He knows she has to tell him everything.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka amxelele yonke into.
There was nothing here.	Apha kwakungekho nto.
I'm thinking of you, too.	Ndicinga ngawe, nam.
Or it should.	Okanye kufuneka.
You just don't know it.	Awuyazi nje.
He would wait another week, he finished.	Wayeza kulinda enye iveki, wagqiba.
We have done well all the time so far.	Senze kakuhle ngalo lonke ixesha kude kube ngoku.
I love it all, I love it.	Ndiyayithanda yonke, ndiyayithanda.
He looked away, but thought better of it.	Wajonga ecaleni, kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
Last week, something very bad happened.	Kwiveki ephelileyo, kwenzeke into embi kakhulu.
It will be better at night.	Kuya kuba ngcono ebusuku.
However you would like.	Nangona kunjalo ungathanda.
I don’t know what’s wrong with it.	Andazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngayo.
If you can be who you want to be.	Ukuba unokuba nguye nabani na afuna ukuba nguye.
He looked his way.	Wajonga indlela yakhe.
Do not do this.	Musa ukuyenza le nto.
He can't do it fast enough.	Akanakuyenza ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Good thing !.	Into entle!.
What and what.	Yintoni na kwaye yintoni na.
I don't know how this can be.	Andiqondi ukuba inokuba njani le nto.
One of us will.	Omnye wethu uya kwenza njalo.
All the way.	Kuyo yonke indlela.
What do you stand for ?.	Umele ntoni?.
I do that a lot.	Ndiyenza loo nto kakhulu.
You want to be human.	Ufuna ukuba ngumntu.
He does the work for you.	Wenza umsebenzi kuwe.
He looked back quickly.	Wajonga ngasemva ngokukhawuleza.
It was all over.	Kwaphela konke.
But if possible.	Kodwa ukuba kunokwenzeka.
All the time, but what needs to be done.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, kodwa yintoni ekufuneka yenziwe.
But if you did.	Kodwa ukuba uyenzile .
He asked me.	Wandibuza.
But he was coming.	Kodwa wayeza.
He will stay with her.	Uza kuhlala naye.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto.
I've been here a long time.	Kudala ndilapha.
See you tomorrow!.	Ndiza kubona ngomso!.
I'm not sure why this is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni le nto.
Probably just a few.	Mhlawumbi nje ezimbalwa.
You only read three books at a time.	Ufunda iincwadi ezintathu kuphela ngexesha.
He has gone to it.	Uye wahamba waya kuyo.
He apologized to her.	Wacela uxolo kuye.
I don't know for now.	Andazi ukuba okwangoku.
All the way.	Indlela yonke.
That happened many times.	Oko kwenzeka izihlandlo ezininzi.
This is going to happen a lot.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kakhulu.
I can't really think.	Andikwazi ncam ukucinga.
In the bedroom.	Kwigumbi lokulala.
I hope it will happen.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kwenzeka.
I don't understand why you want to do this.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni ufuna ukwenza oku.
I feel the same way.	Ndiziva ngendlela efanayo.
I did that.	Ndiyenzile loo nto.
Of course, that always happens.	Kunjalo, oko kwenzeka njalo.
Every day a new problem.	Yonke imihla ingxaki entsha.
This has certainly not been fun.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akuzange kube mnandi.
We'll talk to you later.	Siza kuthetha nawe kamva.
We know this is not your thing.	Siyazi ukuba asiyonto yakho le.
He certainly goes all or nothing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya konke okanye akukho nto.
I don't want to be too hard.	Andifuni ukuba nzima kakhulu.
It was not difficult to do.	Kwakungekho nzima ukwenza.
I said nothing to anyone.	Khange ndithethe nto komnye umntu.
It is better to buy two.	Kungcono uthenge ezimbini.
He came down.	Wehla.
Everyone knows what to do.	Wonke umntu uyayazi into amakayenze.
I saw a lot.	Ndabona kakhulu.
Not by man.	Hayi ngumntu.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Andazi noba yinyani leyo okanye hayi.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele ukuba.
I have no idea how it all happened.	Andazi kwaphela ukuba kwenzeke njani.
He works again.	Usebenza kwakhona.
We will not talk about it.	Asiyi kuthetha ngayo.
It's not fun.	Akukho mnandi ke.
See how long it takes.	Jonga ukuba kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
You’re wasting your time, though.	Udlala ngexesha lakho, nangona kunjalo.
Just trying to get out.	Ukuzama nje ukuphuma.
He never came to her.	Akazange eze kuye.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Bendingazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
In the afternoon, he began to see things.	Emva kwemini, waqalisa ukubona izinto.
Yes, thank you for your time.	Ewe, enkosi ngexesha lakho.
I just don't understand.	Andiqondi nje.
My wife is doing better.	Umfazi wam wenza ngcono.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
Something else here.	Enye into apha.
He knows that's his job here.	Uyazi ukuba ngumsebenzi wakhe lowo apha.
He did not now.	Akazange ngoku.
I think about that a lot.	Ndicinga ngaloo nto kakhulu.
Really, I did.	Ngenene, ndenze njalo.
If you think.	Ukuba ucinga .
They will be back once and for all.	Baza kubuya kanye.
Sure, he thought, he had to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wacinga, kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I think you are here.	Ndicinga ukuba ulapha.
Not a woman.	Hayi umfazi.
That's what happened, though.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo, nangona kunjalo.
But he loves it there.	Kodwa uyayithanda apho.
Again, hours.	Kwakhona, iiyure.
Although not a bit.	Nangona hayi kancinci.
There is something up there.	Kukho into phaya phezulu.
Whatever you think.	Nokuba ucinga ntoni na.
I'm not entirely sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
It will be fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi.
My mother decided to go to school.	Umama wagqiba ekubeni aye esikolweni.
That's what I'm trying to do.	Yiloo nto ndizama ukuyenza.
At night.	Ebusuku.
I want that from me.	Ndifuna lonto kum.
I never knew who he was.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
Do you think anything?	Ngaba ucinga nantoni na?
It happens again and again.	Kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
They go to it.	Baya kuyo.
To find out more.	Ukufumana ngakumbi.
Good and good.	Kuhle kwaye kulungile.
I wanted to make time.	Ndandifuna ukwenza ixesha.
Everyone is watching.	Wonke umntu ujonge.
I read last night that.	Ndifunde phezolo ukuba.
Where is that? 	Iphi lonto?
I tried to talk about it.	Ndazama ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
Or a word.	Okanye ilizwi.
We want to get out of here.	Sifuna ukuphuma apha.
Everyone has to do their job.	Wonke umntu kufuneka enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
The police never arrived.	Amapolisa akazange afike tu.
I will have to help.	Kuya kufuneka ndincede.
And then, again, nothing.	Kwaye ke, kwakhona, akukho nto.
And he departed.	Kwaye wemka.
We want another way.	Sifuna enye indlela.
Do not overeat.	Musa ukutya kakhulu.
I want you for me.	Ndifuna wena ngam.
Cat, please look.	Ikati, nceda ujonge.
It ended badly, but.	Kwaphela kakubi kakhulu, kodwa.
Always in everything there.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kuyo yonke into apho.
I couldn't help it after all.	Khange ndikwazi tu ukuzibamba emva koko.
They will be coming soon.	Baza kuza kwangoko.
Two things.	Izinto ezimbini.
True or false.	Yinyani okanye akunjalo.
He arrived here yesterday	Ufike apha izolo
As it is, it only seems to me.	Njengoko kunjalo, kubonakala kum kuphela.
It's not ours.	Asiyonto yethu.
Just as you think you are.	Kanye njengokuba ucinga ukuba unjalo.
It doesn't have to be hard.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube nzima.
What's new.	Yintoni entsha.
You know what happened to me.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo kum.
I think that's it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
I better stay alone.	Kungcono ndihlale ndedwa.
Here it is again.	Nantso kwakhona.
He walked into my office.	Wangena eofisini yam.
Looks like you have it.	Kubonakala ngathi unayo.
It can be anyone.	Inokuba nabani na.
It is a long time coming.	Lixesha elide elizayo.
That would be better.	Oko kuya kuba ngcono.
Then he realized what was happening.	Waza waqonda ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
One thing at a time.	Into enye ngexesha.
I hope that is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani leyo.
In the end he just did.	Ekugqibeleni wenza nje.
I try to think back to everything that happened to me.	Ndizama ukucinga emva kuyo yonke into eyenzekileyo kum.
I will stay here.	Ndiya kuhlala apha.
Then he spoke.	Emva koko wathetha.
I would like to know what it is.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
I'm just glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya nje ukuba lapha.
I think it will take a long time.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuthatha ixesha elide.
And then we'll talk about it again next week.	Kwaye ke siza kuthetha ngayo kwakhona kwiveki ezayo.
He's here now it's okay for us to go.	Ulapha ngoku kulungile ukuba sihambe.
You will want to.	Uya kufuna.
And if something happens, that's fine.	Kwaye ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo, kulungile.
That is why you are so angry.	Yiloo nto ke ekwenza ube nomsindo kakhulu.
They have to go to school.	Kufuneka baye esikolweni.
I'm sure this time.	Ndiqinisekile ngeli xesha.
He is, the answer.	Nguye, impendulo.
I will continue like that.	Ndiya kuqhubeka ngolo hlobo.
He did not want to go there.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho.
I am confident that we will succeed.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba siya kuphumelela.
I think you are talking to everyone.	Ndicinga ukuba uthetha naye wonke umntu.
But you do not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba ube njalo.
I hope this is the case.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kunjalo.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha yinto engaqhelekanga.
And not just any book.	Kwaye hayi nayiphi na incwadi.
He looked up quickly.	Wajonga phezulu ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe better in bed, too.	Mhlawumbi ngcono ebhedini, kakhulu.
It's too far away.	Kude kakhulu kuyo.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
It was nothing though.	Kwakungekho nto nangona.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kum.
It will have to be easier.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kube lula ngakumbi.
No, you said one word.	Hayi, uthethe ilizwi elinye.
How strange this place is!	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo le ndawo!
You will make many friends here.	Uya kwenza abahlobo abaninzi apha.
You do not want to help my work.	Awufuni ukunceda umsebenzi wam.
He is right there.	Ukhona kanye.
He did it alone.	Wayenza yedwa.
Some here, some in town.	Abanye apha, abanye edolophini.
That is why my father decided to leave.	Yiyo loo nto utata wagqiba kwelokuba ahambe.
Maybe if you just said a little bit.	Mhlawumbi ukuba uthethe nje kancinci.
I do not know him.	Andikwazi naye.
that.	leyo.
This is a very big deal.	Le yinto enkulu kakhulu.
I do not know where it is.	Andazi ukuba iphi.
I hope you know that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
If so, that's a good idea.	Ukuba kunjalo, licebo elihle.
I can't even be a friend.	Andikwazi nokuba ngumhlobo.
So, yes, that's fine.	Ke, ewe, kulungile.
I don't know why, but she is.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa unjalo.
If not.	Ukuba akukho.
My question now.	Umbuzo wam ngoku.
You have to stay away from him.	Kufuneka uhlale kude kuye.
A little too hard.	Kancinci kunzima kakhulu.
The problem is, you don't want to.	Ingxaki kukuba, awufuni.
I can not wait.	Andikwazi kulinda.
That happened a lot at that time.	Oko kwenzeka kakhulu ngelo xesha.
It's just right.	Ilungile nje.
Well, no, no.	Ewe, akunjalo, hayi.
I never thought you could do it.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ungayenza.
This time it was one man.	Ngeli xesha yindoda enye.
You want something coming to me.	Ufuna into eza kum.
Look at the big picture.	Jonga umfanekiso omkhulu.
I really want to talk to you.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe.
Just then my mother came out.	Kanye ngelo xesha waphuma umama.
They live inside.	Bahlala ngaphakathi.
But, of course, he never said such a thing.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange athethe into enjalo.
But it's hard, it's very hard.	Kodwa kunzima, kunzima kakhulu.
That would make all of this more difficult.	Oko bekuya kwenza konke oku kube nzima ngakumbi.
Children do not have to go to school.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba abantwana baye esikolweni.
It really is.	Yinto ngokwenene.
Who is new.	Ngubani omtsha.
He said he would not be far away.	Wathi akayi kuba kude.
And you know everything.	Kwaye wazi yonke into.
Learning is work.	Ukufunda ngumsebenzi.
It will happen soon.	Iza kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Seeing people.	Ukubona abantu.
That is much better.	Oko kungcono kakhulu.
So you drive my car.	Ngoko uqhuba imoto yam.
Good thing.	Into entle.
That could happen, he realized.	Oko kunokwenzeka, waqonda.
Look down.	Jonga phantsi.
This is your job.	Ngumsebenzi wakho lo.
you will say.	uya kuthi.
One more thing, though.	Enye into, nangona kunjalo.
Are you ok?' 	Ingaba ulungile?'
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Wayesazi nje ukuba akafuni ukuba yedwa.
He said a lot about this.	Wayethetha izinto ezininzi ngale nto.
No, that's something.	Hayi, yinto ethile leyo.
But you can't.	Kodwa awukwazi.
There was no need to be hard.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba nzima.
He saw what it was.	Wabona ukuba yintoni na.
Because it will be fun.	Kuba kuya kuba mnandi.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I don't even know who she is.	Andazi nokuba ngubani.
You must stay here with us.	Kufuneka uhlale apha nathi.
Or it should be.	Okanye bekufanele ukuba.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube ngoku.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Ukuba ufuna ukuhamba, kufuneka uhambe.
I thought he did.	Ndandicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
Or not at all.	Okanye hayi ngokupheleleyo.
What are they doing?	Ingaba wenza ntoni?
I wanted to see everything.	Ndandifuna ukubona yonke into.
But this is really happening.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
I hoped it wasn't me.	Bendinethemba lokuba ayindim.
He will stay another two days.	Uya kuhlala ezinye iintsuku ezimbini.
I want to be something.	Ndifuna ukuba yinto.
Come here to me.	Uze apha kum.
But there you have it.	Kodwa apho unayo.
He wanted life.	Wayefuna ubomi.
You eat well, but you talk a little.	Utya kakuhle, kodwa uthetha kancinci.
But in the end he is the man.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni yindoda leyo.
He looked at the place.	Wajonga loo ndawo.
No one stayed up late.	Akukho mntu wahlala emva kwexesha.
In fact, it is quite impossible.	Ngokwenene, akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
This, not so much.	Oku, hayi kakhulu.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala.
Something strange is happening there.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo apho.
This takes a lot of time.	Oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
And, sooner or later, you will make a mistake.	Kwaye, kungekudala okanye kamva, uya kwenza impazamo.
I never went there.	Andizange ndihambe ndiye apho.
It will be very, very much so.	Kuya kuba kakhulu, kakhulu kakhulu.
He's driving fast now.	Uqhuba ngokukhawuleza ngoku.
Perhaps his wife has a similar problem.	Mhlawumbi umfazi wakhe unengxaki efanayo.
I did not see anyone.	Khange ndibone mntu.
Many people have to go to the hospital regularly.	Abantu abaninzi kufuneka baye esibhedlele rhoqo.
I want you to do it.	Ndifuna uyenze.
Not just children.	Hayi nje abantwana.
They say yes.	Bathi ewe.
Sorry, but that's the whole answer.	Uxolo, kodwa yiyo yonke impendulo leyo.
Without thinking, she ran away.	Akazange acinge, wabaleka.
No one tried.	Akukho mntu wazama.
In this case.	Kule meko.
But.	Kodwa.
The work is progressing well.	Umsebenzi uqhuba kakuhle.
However, it was too early.	Nangona kunjalo, kwangethuba.
This is not possible, however.	Oku akunakwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
Then he thought of something else.	Emva koko wacinga enye into.
He talked a little to me and took my money.	Wathetha kancinci nam wathatha imali yam.
Then he said he was much older than you.	Emva koko wathi mdala kakhulu kunawe.
Just like you are.	Kanye njengokuba unjalo.
But now he had to make a quick debt.	Kodwa ngoku kwafuneka akhe ityala ngokukhawuleza.
He is very interested in me.	Unomdla kum kakhulu.
Who is this person?	Ngubani lo mntu?
In a month.	Kwinyanga.
He will come here.	Uza kuza apha.
Maybe that's just the way it is.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo nje.
I wanted one.	Bendifuna enye.
Or it could be.	Okanye inokuba njalo.
Unless I told him.	Ngaphandle kokuba ndimxelele.
The worst mistake.	Impazamo embi kakhulu.
He asked if she wanted to go with him.	Wabuza ukuba uyafuna na ukuhamba naye.
However, it is difficult to do many things well.	Nangona kunjalo, kunzima ukwenza izinto ezininzi kakuhle.
oh yeah.	ewe.
She got scared and ran away.	Uye woyika wabaleka.
Now you are here.	Ngoku ulapha.
I would like to try.	Ndingathanda ukuzama.
He decided he was tired.	Wagqiba kwelokuba udiniwe.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
She ran out of the room.	Wabaleka waphuma egumbini.
All but one except you.	Bonke ngaphandle komnye ngaphandle kwakho.
This happened, in the end.	Oku kwenzeka, ekugqibeleni.
Not yet, not exactly.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ncam.
To travel.	Ukuhamba.
Because you think you said the wrong thing.	Kuba ucinga ukuba uthethe into engalunganga.
He left.	Wemka.
I did not want to see.	Ndandingafuni ukubona.
But big money no.	Kodwa imali enkulu hayi.
But the police did.	Kodwa amapolisa enjenjalo.
Everyone was talking about him.	Wonke umntu wayethetha ngaye.
This will be very difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
You're tired, yes.	Udiniwe, ewe.
And before long.	Kwaye ngaphambi kwexesha elide.
Your man back there.	Umntu wakho phaya emva.
Is everything all right? 	Ngaba yonke into ilungile?
What should you do?	Kufuneka wenze ntoni?
Again, nothing happened.	Kwakhona, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
In every answer, there is another question.	Kuyo yonke impendulo, kukho omnye umbuzo.
He will not take anything.	Akayi kuthatha nto.
We have to do all the work.	Kufuneka senze wonke umsebenzi.
I don't remember when.	Andikhumbuli ukuba nini.
But it will come soon.	Kodwa iza kufika kungekudala.
Someone is going somewhere, doing something.	Umntu uya kwindawo ethile, esenza into.
You want to meet me.	Ufuna ukudibana nam.
Today everyone does that.	Namhlanje wonke umntu uyayenza loo nto.
And there is a problem.	Kwaye kukho ingxaki.
I need another gun.	Ndifuna omnye umpu.
Anything can be out.	Nantoni na inokuba ngaphandle.
Everyone is looking down now.	Wonke umntu ujonge phantsi ngoku.
Two hours every morning.	Iiyure ezimbini rhoqo kusasa.
I try one thing, then another.	Ndizama into enye, emva koko enye.
Ikati.	Ikati.
And then he started singing with her.	Kwaye emva koko waqalisa ukucula kunye naye.
He died, immediately.	Wafa, ngoko nangoko.
And everywhere else.	Kwaye kuyo yonke enye indawo.
And so it is with me.	Kwaye kunjalo kum.
You definitely want a job here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna umsebenzi apha.
I will be sad in another way.	Ndiya kuba buhlungu ngenye indlela.
I want to know something else.	Ndifuna ukwazi enye into.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
I love it later more.	Ndiyayithanda kamva ngakumbi.
It seemed like a good thing to him.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto entle kuye.
I didn't know it either.	Bendingayazi nam.
And, death is not.	Kwaye, ukufa akunjalo.
I love it that way.	Ndiyayithanda ngolo hlobo.
Yes, you may be in the front of the room.	Ewe, usenokuba ngaphambili kwigumbi.
I love my dog.	Ndiyayithanda inja yam.
I like it!.	Ndiyayithanda!.
Then he will dwell with us.	Emva koko uya kuhlala nathi.
You are his person.	Ungumntu wakhe.
I never heard of it.	Zange ndive ngayo.
He really wants to be with her.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukuba kunye naye.
It was not necessary for him to be with her.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba abe kunye naye.
So, really.	Ngoko, inyaniso.
He came out and looked up.	Waphuma wajonga phezulu.
You must be tired!	Inokuba udiniwe!
Or you might like to do it.	Okanye ungathanda ukwenza.
Or someone else.	Okanye omnye umntu.
My answer is this.	Impendulo yam yile.
Well, not really.	Ewe, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Have you heard of it before?	Ngaba ukhe weva ngaphambili?
Yes, something happened.	Ewe, kukho into eyenzekayo.
What yes it is.	Yintoni ewe yiyo.
I think he did.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
Some, maybe not.	Abanye, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
What's the matter? 	Yintoni ingxaki?
You do well with it.	Uqhuba kakuhle ngayo.
He really does.	Uyenza ngokwenene.
It never really happened.	Zange yenzeke ncam.
To me, that would be impossible.	Kum, oko akunakwenzeka.
So, there you are.	Ngoko, nantso.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
Why a good question.	Kutheni umbuzo olungileyo.
This is my job.	Ngumsebenzi wam lo.
All in all, this time.	Konke, ngeli xesha.
I think you did the right thing.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into elungileyo.
I'm tired though.	Ndidiniwe kodwa.
It takes almost a lifetime to read one book.	Kuthatha phantse ubomi bonke ukufunda incwadi enye.
Fast, fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza.
It's hard to tell now.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngoku.
I know he did.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza njalo.
Yes, his people.	Ewe, abantu bakhe.
I thought it was my turn.	Bendicinga ukuba lixesha lam.
We will be there.	Siya kuba lapho.
Sorry but true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani.
I think we'll see.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kubona.
However, ours.	Nangona kunjalo, yethu.
After a meal, he fell asleep.	Emva kwesidlo, uye walala.
Please do your homework now.	Ndicela wenze umsebenzi wakho wesikolo ngoku.
I’d like to say one thing, though.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha into enye, nangona kunjalo.
What time will it be?	Iza kuba ngubani ixesha?
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.
There was no way.	Kwakungekho ndlela.
I tried to do things.	Ndazama ukwenza izinto.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
Someone did this.	Ngumntu owenze lento.
You immediately want another question.	Ngoko nangoko ufuna omnye umbuzo.
That would be nice.	Oko kunokuba kuhle.
It happens, of course.	Kwenzeka, kunjalo.
He started thinking about leaving.	Waqalisa ukucinga ukuhamba.
I wanted to get a job in the city.	Ndandifuna ukufumana umsebenzi edolophini.
You know, as you like.	Uyazi, njengoko uthanda.
I know you can't talk about it.	Ndiyazi awukwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
I think you did a good job.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle.
But today we will do just that.	Kodwa namhlanje siza kwenza kanye loo nto.
No, that must mean a lot of money.	Hayi, kumele ukuba kuthetha imali eninzi.
But really, it could be anything.	Kodwa ngokwenene, inokuba nantoni na.
Clearly, he does not want much.	Ngokucacileyo, akafuni nto ingako.
Children should go to school regularly.	Abantwana kufuneka baye esikolweni rhoqo.
No one knows why or how.	Akukho mntu uyazi ukuba kutheni okanye njani.
Something happened here recently.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo apha mva nje.
I would really like to meet him.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukudibana naye.
Would you like to go with me?	Ungathanda ukuhamba nam?
He saw peace.	Wabona uxolo.
It's new to me.	Yinto entsha kum.
Something terrible happened there.	Kwenzeke into embi apho.
Just something.	Into nje.
He thought he had it.	Wayecinga ukuba unayo.
You will be able to help.	Uya kukwazi ukunceda.
I don't know what time it is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani ixesha.
The meeting will be tomorrow.	Intlanganiso iya kuba ngomso.
He did not comment on the matter.	Akazange athethe ngale nto.
For anything really.	Kuba nantoni na ngokwenene.
All right though.	Kulungile kunjalo.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
He got two.	Wafumana ezimbini.
I do not want to be alone.	Andifuni ukuba ndedwa.
I was.	Ndive.
He will have to help us.	Kuya kufuneka asincede.
Well, maybe next month.	Hayi ke, mhlawumbi kwinyanga ezayo.
Again, no problem.	Kwakhona, akukho ngxaki.
Not the police, not the police.	Hayi amapolisa, hayi amapolisa.
All of us.	Yethu sonke.
I know it can be hard to come here.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunokuba nzima ukuza apha.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
is that a good thing ???.	yinto entle leyo???.
It was as if he didn't want anything.	Ngathi zange afune nto.
I want to stay.	Ndifuna ukuhlala.
I would like to know that.	Ndingathanda ukwazi oko.
He has it for you.	Unayo kuwe.
He does not think so.	Akacingi ngolo hlobo.
I know it is possible.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Just sitting inside.	Ukuhlala nje ngaphakathi.
Or, it seems to us.	Okanye, kubonakala ngathi.
I would like to speak with him today.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye namhlanje.
But, the big question.	Kodwa, umbuzo omkhulu.
He did this.	Oku wakwenza.
That begins.	Kuqala ke oko.
I'm not sure now what happened to it.	Andiqinisekanga ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuyo.
Otherwise it is impossible to move.	Ngaphandle koko akunakwenzeka ukuhamba.
Well, that's exactly it.	Ewe, kanye loo nto.
But maybe that's just the way it is.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kunjalo nje.
I look back on that a lot.	Ndijonge emva kuloo nto kakhulu.
It all starts at the beginning.	Konke kuqala ekuqaleni.
Will it come to your house.	Ngaba iza kufika endlwini yakho.
Not exactly.	Akukho ncam.
He asked questions.	Wabuza imibuzo.
He sat down next to her.	Wahlala phantsi ecaleni kwakhe.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba .
I will continue again.	Ndiza kuqhubeka kwakhona.
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le.
No one is behind.	Akukho mntu ngasemva.
There is no way to make money.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza imali.
Yeah, a little bit of talking.	Ewe, kancinci ukuthetha kancinci.
No one is coming or going.	Akukho mntu uza okanye uhamba.
I don't know what your problem might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba yintoni kanye ingxaki yakho.
I don't know who else might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba ngubani omnye.
But it could be anything.	Kodwa inokuba yinto yonke.
Now he knew.	Ngoku wayesazi.
And we didn't have much time.	Kwaye asizange sibe nexesha elide.
Yeah, maybe one.	Ewe, mhlawumbi enye.
I wanted a car.	Bendifuna imoto.
He can never do that.	Akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
You should know this.	Ufanele ukwazi oku.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
But it does not have to be this way.	Kodwa akufuneki kube njalo.
Being human is good.	Ukuba ngumntu kulungile.
Please come.	Ndicela uze.
Let me do it this way.	Mandiyenze ngolu hlobo.
Is it okay ?.	Ngaba kulungile?.
However, nothing will happen at home.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nto iya kwenzeka ekhaya.
I like my way better, don't I?	Ndiyayithanda ngcono indlela yam, akunjalo?
But that is a small thing.	Kodwa yinto encinci leyo.
Whether.	Nokuba ngaba.
I'll go with you if you like.	Ndiya kuhamba nawe ukuba uyathanda.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
I think there are two things.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho izinto ezimbini.
There is a place everywhere.	Kukho indawo yonke indawo.
When he finished his supper, he fell asleep.	Ukugqiba kwakhe isidlo sangokuhlwa, walala.
One day though.	Ngenye imini nangona.
The truth is, there is no one way.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho ndlela enye.
Not so this morning.	Akunjalo namhlanje ekuseni.
If you will not create.	Ukuba akuyi kudala.
You made a big mistake!	Wenza impazamo enkulu!
We all need to go further.	Sonke kufuneka sihambe ngakumbi.
And he likes to be that way.	Kwaye uyathanda ukuba njalo.
He went with you then.	Wahamba nawe ngoko.
I think this is a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba le yinto elungileyo.
He would have to do it.	Bekuya kufuneka ayenze.
To be with me.	Ukuba nam.
Truth is not just one thing.	Inyaniso asiyonto nje enye.
Plus, it's not too fun.	Ngaphezu koko, akukho mnandi kakhulu.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Everyone just wants to be his friend.	Kuphela nje wonke umntu ufuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
Thanks, of course.	Enkosi, kunjalo.
Yeah, that's it, really.	Ewe, yiloo nto, ngokwenene.
I'm not entirely sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Let me tell you something.	Makhe ndikuxelele enye into.
No one asked why.	Akukho mntu wabuza ukuba kutheni.
I'm not entirely sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo.
I'm so tired!	Ndidiniwe kakhulu!
Other than that, it is very good.	Ngaphandle koko, kuhle kakhulu.
He is taller than me.	Mde kunam.
And then death.	Kwaye ke ukufa.
I can't find anything.	Andikwazi ukufumana nantoni na into.
He is sure of everything.	Uqinisekile ngayo yonke into.
It should not have happened.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba yenzeke.
If you want to, of course.	Ukuba uyafuna, kunjalo.
Going to it.	Ukuya kuyo.
I did not wait any longer.	Khange ndiphinde ndilinde.
To quit means to give up.	Ukuyeka kuthetha ukuyeka.
And I went with it.	Kwaye ndihambe nayo.
Let me tell you, he did.	Makhe ndikuxelele, wenza njalo.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
We'll be back soon.	Siza kufika kungekudala.
We will go together.	Siya kuhamba kunye.
What's that? 	Yintoni lo nto?
That person is intelligent.	Loo mntu ukrelekrele.
It comes in handy.	Uza kakuhle.
This is clear there.	Oku kucacile apho.
It will make such a beautiful picture.	Kuya kwenza umfanekiso omhle kangaka.
He refused.	Akazange avume.
It is good to be successful.	Kulungile ukuba uphumelele.
I will not take a job.	Andiyi kuthatha umsebenzi.
He needed help and immediately.	Wayefuna uncedo kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa yinyani.
I got home.	Ndifike endlini.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
Where did everyone go?	Uye phi wonke umntu?
You have your money.	Unayo imali yakho.
You do not have to get to school early.	Akufuneki ufike kwangoko esikolweni.
But it has never been done before.	Kodwa ayizange yenziwe ngaphambili.
You need to make a debt right away.	Kufuneka wenze ityala kwangoko.
You have to sit down.	Kufuneka uhlale phantsi.
A little today.	Kancinci namhlanje.
Just as he did.	Kanye njengokuba esenza.
It’s better to play less, but better.	Kungcono ukudlala kancinci, kodwa ngcono.
And he is not alone.	Kwaye ayinguye yedwa.
He looked for a long time.	Wajonga ixesha elide.
He will not return for a few days.	Akayi kubuya iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I wanted to do one, too.	Bendifuna ukwenza enye, nam.
I came and sat next to him.	Ndifike ndihlale ecaleni kwakhe.
No one really.	Akukho mntu ngokwenene.
And this is exactly what it is.	Kwaye oku kunjalo kanye.
Strange thing, you know.	Into engaqhelekanga, uyazi.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	Ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nathi, kulungile.
You will not make much money by doing this.	Awuyi kwenza imali eninzi ngokwenza oku.
I could not do that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
He never became our friend.	Akazange abe ngumhlobo wethu.
And look.	Kwaye jonga.
This is a good thing.	Le yinto entle.
Not that they will certainly know.	Akunjalo ukuba ngokuqinisekileyo baya kukwazi.
I just wanted to.	Bendifuna nje.
But there is something else, too.	Kodwa kukho enye into, nayo.
As it is, now.	Njengoko kunjalo, ngoku.
And now look at him.	Kwaye ngoku jonga kuye.
You're right now.	Ulungile ngoku.
And, of course.	Kwaye, kunjalo.
Then, one.	Emva koko, enye.
Do not work like that here.	Musa ukusebenza ngolo hlobo apha.
That’s what it is, though.	Nantso ke into, nangona kunjalo.
The first question for me, though.	Umbuzo wokuqala kum, nangona kunjalo.
I had to think.	Kwafuneka ndicinge.
You don't want to go either.	Nawe awufuni kuhamba.
I pretend not to see.	Ndenza ngathi andiboni.
Check up.	Jonga.
Not maybe about it.	Hayi mhlawumbi malunga nayo.
Do you think that you will succeed?	Ngaba ucinga ukuba uya kuphumelela?
This is just fine.	Oku kuhle nje.
Like you now.	Njengawe ngoku.
I have to be away from here.	Kufuneka ndibe kude apha.
But no, he didn't say anything before he left.	Kodwa hayi, akazange athethe nto ngaphambi kokuba ahambe.
I will have to do it myself.	Kuya kufuneka ndiyenze ngokwam.
You look like him.	Ufana naye.
Something must be wrong.	Kumele ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
You will be alone after that.	Uzakuba wedwa emva koko.
But it can be a bad thing.	Kodwa inokuba yinto embi.
He said nothing, looked away.	Akazange athethe nto, wajonga kude.
You will live in my house.	Uza kuhlala endlini yam.
That in the beginning.	Oko ekuqaleni.
Maybe there's a reason why.	Mhlawumbi kukho isizathu sokuba.
What else do I need to do here.	Yintoni enye ekufuneka ndiyenzile apha.
He did not stay that long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide ngolo hlobo.
It seemed to be him.	Kwakubonakala ukuba nguye.
But there is something else before you go.	Kodwa kukho enye into ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
This is not the case now.	Oku akunjalo ngoku.
You are always reading.	Uhlala ufunda.
Money, one thing.	Imali, into enye.
But he thought it might be you.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguwe.
Well, you don't want one.	Kulungile, awufuni enye.
That's exactly right.	Unjalo kanye.
If you need my help.	Ukuba ufuna uncedo lwam.
He tried to stay, but he could not control himself.	Wazama ukuhlala, kodwa akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
Watch and wait.	Jonga kwaye ulinde.
He thought so too.	Naye wayecinga njalo.
I am a thing.	Ke le nto.
Up front.	Phaya ngaphambili.
But you did not come.	Kodwa awuzange uze.
I would like to think that that really never happened.	Ndingathanda ukucinga ukuba oko ngokwenene akuzange kwenzeke.
He slept with her.	Walala naye.
And one before.	Kwaye enye ngaphambili.
Please sit down.	Nceda uhlale phantsi.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Your wife should be here soon.	Umfazi wakho kufuneka abe lapha kungekudala.
Or as soon as it could be immediate.	Okanye ngokukhawuleza ukuba inokuba kwangoko.
He tried to think of nothing.	Wazama ukucinga kwanto.
Certainly,	Ngokuqinisekileyo,
Don't forget anything.	Ungalibali nantoni na.
Everyone knows it.	Wonke umntu uyayazi.
Now it seemed that he would have to do just that.	Ngoku kwakubonakala ukuba kuza kufuneka enze kanye loo nto.
I thought about new money.	Ndacinga ngemali entsha.
I think he knew.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesazi.
Certainly not for me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungekho kum.
Again and again and again.	Kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwakhona.
You do not have to be angry.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube nomsindo.
Then two.	Emva koko ezimbini.
I don't know where my shirt is.	Andazi ukuba iphi ihempe yam.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
I saw the way.	Ndabona indlela.
You go where you want to go.	Uya apho ufuna ukuya khona.
Would you like to go with you?	Ngaba ungathanda ukuhamba nawe?
I should not have done this.	Akufunekanga ndiyenze le nto.
Sorry, but later.	Uxolo, kodwa emva kwexesha.
He plays very well.	Udlala kakuhle kakhulu.
This is all.	Le nto yonke.
He knew.	Wayesazi.
But not there.	Kodwa hayi apho.
If you can talk about it.	Ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
I want to see more though.	Ndifuna ukubona ngakumbi nangona kunjalo.
I finally did it.	Ekugqibeleni ndiyenzile.
No, it seems he did, but he never did.	Hayi, kubonakala ngathi wenza, kodwa akazange.
I don't want him to leave right now.	Andifuni ahambe okwangoku.
We need to make a story.	Kufuneka senze ibali.
You will be here with him.	Uzakuba lapha naye.
So, what are you waiting for?	Ngoko, ulindele ntoni?
He did not know how to make money.	Wayengazi ukuba enze njani imali.
He would have to have not done it.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba akenzanga.
I think you are very smart.	Ndicinga ukuba ukrelekrele kakhulu.
He made a very small statement.	Wenza intetho encinci kakhulu.
Is a party.	Ngaba itheko.
I will talk a lot about him, too.	Ndiza kuthetha kakhulu ngaye, naye.
There was no food.	Kwakungekho kutya.
He looked away quickly.	Wajonga ecaleni ngokukhawuleza.
You have to be, too.	Ufanele ukuba njalo, nawe.
Well, not to you.	Ewe, hayi kuwe.
Much more indeed.	Okuninzi ngakumbi ngokwenene.
But it is probably not that easy.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
I'm not sure why, but it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kunjalo, kodwa kunjalo.
He can't drive.	Akakwazi ukuqhuba.
And now, even if you go, in the end.	Nangoku, nokuba uhamba, ekugqibeleni.
And you can't do that unless you know who the person is.	Kwaye awukwazi ukwenza oko ngaphandle kokuba uyazi ukuba ngubani na umntu.
I'm not sure where else.	Andiqinisekanga ngenye indawo.
That happened.	Oko kwenzeka.
Not so much, though.	Hayi kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I just want to be alone.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndedwa.
I want another chance.	Ndifuna elinye ithuba.
Not for years yet.	Hayi iminyaka okwangoku.
I'm so sorry	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu
This is not difficult.	Oku akukho nzima.
He doesn't like that.	Akayithandi loo nto.
Or as good.	Okanye njengoko kuhle.
I mean, a dog is everything.	Ndithetha ukuba, inja yinto yonke.
Do not make the same mistake.	Musa ukwenza impazamo efanayo.
I'm not going anywhere with you.	Andiyi ndawo nawe.
No, you did not.	Hayi, awuzange.
He works hard and does a good job.	Usebenza nzima kwaye wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
They went to the hospital.	Baya esibhedlele.
He is like us.	Ufana nathi.
We will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
You read a little.	Ufunda kancinci.
He likes that too.	Naye uyayithanda loo nto.
I doubt it will be that easy.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kuya kuba lula oko.
I am supposed to.	Ndifanele ukuba.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
And you have to be.	Kwaye kufuneka ube.
There is a reason for him to go to her.	Kukho isizathu sokuba aye kuye.
Yes women.	Ewe akazi.
And then, it's time for us to go.	Kwaye ke, lixesha lokuba sihambe.
Yes, you want a new one.	Ewe, ufuna entsha.
He did his death.	Wenza ukufa kwakhe.
You feel good and successful.	Uziva ulungile kwaye uphumelele.
I don't like it either.	Nam andiyithandi.
If you do.	Ukuba wenza njalo.
You have to think about that.	Kufuneka ucinge ngaloo nto.
I'm looking forward to the city.	Ndijonge edolophini.
But that's me.	Kodwa ndim lowo.
We never had any.	Asizange sibe nayo nayiphi na.
And dad.	Kwaye utata.
There was no one in the room.	Kwakungekho mntu egumbini.
But he could not succeed.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuphumelela.
You know it well there.	Wazi kakuhle apho.
I know it's done.	Ndiyazi ukuba yenziwe.
We'll wait until you're in place.	Siza kulinda de ube kwindawo.
I knew what it was going to be.	Ndandisazi ukuba iya kuba yintoni na.
He has everything.	Unayo yonke into.
I need to know how this happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
I will bring him here.	Ndiza kuza naye apha.
But he wanted to say the same thing.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuthetha into enye.
I hope you are right about that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ulungile ngaloo nto.
One, not so much.	Enye, hayi kakhulu.
It's getting harder.	Kuba nzima.
Otherwise, it will be a good time.	Ngaphandle koko, kuya kuba lixesha elihle.
He knew he would succeed.	Wayesazi ukuba uza kuphumelela.
He opened another.	Wavula enye.
How are you doing.	Wenza njani.
But this seems really good.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kulungile ngokwenene.
I thought this looked good.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku kubonakala kulungile.
I went everywhere.	Ndihambe yonke indawo.
He had never been so far before.	Akazange ahambe kangako ngaphambili.
Yes, it seems you have done very well.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
That is not the case.	Ayisiyiyo loo nto.
He continued.	Waqhubeka.
He often does.	Udla ngokuba njalo.
I've been thinking about you for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngawe.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
One of us has to talk!	Omnye wethu kufuneka athethe!
You never did.	Zange wenze njalo.
Then he started.	Emva koko waqalisa.
Or under him.	Okanye phantsi kwakhe.
I was not thinking clearly.	Ndandingacingi ngokucacileyo.
He finally got out of bed.	Wagqiba wehla ebhedini.
Maybe that would be nice.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba kuhle.
He really did.	Wayenza ngenene.
As you are.	Njengokuba unjalo.
But, that did not happen.	Kodwa, ayizange yenzeke loo nto.
I like meat.	Ndiyayithanda inyama.
You know what's out there.	Uyayazi into elapha phandle.
I wanted money.	Ndandifuna imali.
It is difficult to know exactly where it is.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba iphi kanye kanye.
Let me tell you now, but not a word to anyone.	Makhe ndikuxelele ngoku, kodwa hayi ilizwi komnye.
I went to the hospital.	Ndaya esibhedlele.
And in that case.	Kwaye kuloo meko .
Done, of course.	Yenziwe, kunjalo.
But nothing happened.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke nto.
You are not going to the hospital.	Awuyi esibhedlele.
I'm trying to stay here.	Ndizama ukuhlala apha.
I want to be on top.	Ndifuna ukuba phezulu.
Well, tell me about yourself.	Ke, ndixelele ngawe.
Look out.	Jonga ngaphandle.
He does not know why.	Akasazi isizathu.
Not too much.	Akukho kakhulu.
I want you to talk to me.	Ndifuna uthetha nam.
I just look in front of me.	Ndijonge phambi kwam kuphela.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa, ndiyaxolisa.
Then only his eyes.	Emva koko amehlo akhe kuphela.
Again, thank you very much.	Kwakhona, enkosi kakhulu.
Too many questions.	Imibuzo emininzi kakhulu.
So he did something.	Ngoko kukho into ayenzileyo.
I hope you will stay here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala apha.
It can be very painful.	Unokuba buhlungu kakhulu.
No one is doing better.	Akukho mntu wenza ngcono.
I just know we will be together.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba siza kuba kunye.
He lay there.	Walala apho.
One has to do something about it.	Umntu kufuneka enze into ngaloo nto.
I think you know what that will mean.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni oko.
Well, of course, if you want to.	Ewe, kunjalo, ukuba uyafuna.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokukhawuleza.
That is what we must do.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka senze.
And this takes a very long time.	Kwaye oku kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
And stop driving.	Kwaye yeka ukuqhuba.
Maybe there is something bigger at work.	Mhlawumbi kukho into enkulu emsebenzini.
More about what?	Ngakumbi ngantoni?
He said, fine.	Wathi, kuhle.
This is possible today.	Oku kunokwenzeka namhlanje.
You will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka ube.
I look in the room.	Ndijonge egumbini.
We will continue and do this.	Siza kuqhubeka kwaye siyenze le nto.
We did everything well.	Senze yonke into kakuhle.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
More than ever.	Ngaphezu koko nanini na.
It is very good that when such a thing happens.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba xa kwenzeka into enjalo.
She has done a very good job.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu umsebenzi wakhe.
I did not do that well.	khange ndiyenze kakuhle lonto.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kukho indlela engcono yokwenza oku.
Every time, he left.	Ngalo lonke ithuba, uye wahamba.
But maybe you do too.	Kodwa mhlawumbi nawe unayo.
There is one for you, too.	Kukho enye yakho, nawe.
Dad is trying to work.	Utata uzama ukusebenza.
Or something similar.	Okanye into efanayo.
Or for money.	Okanye ngemali.
You, of course.	Wena, kunjalo.
I'm here for this.	Ndilapha ngale nto.
But it can be.	Kodwa kunokuba njalo.
Not always though.	Akunjalo rhoqo nangona kunjalo.
I will talk more.	Ndiza kuthetha ngakumbi.
You need to know how to do it.	Kufuneka uyazi indlela yokwenza.
A mother should have her children, she thought.	Umama ufanele abe nabantwana bakhe, wacinga njalo.
And that's it.	Kwaye loo nto yinto.
I can't read this.	Andikwazi ukufunda oku.
That's my job when he's here.	Ngumsebenzi wam lowo xa elapha.
And everything is fine.	Kwaye yonke into ilungile.
He will be the first.	Uya kuba ngowokuqala.
Impossible to tell, really.	Akunakwenzeka ukuxelela, ngokwenene.
I will be here.	Ndiza kuba apha.
Then he looked at us.	Emva koko wajonga kuthi.
But you know how it goes.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba kuhamba njani.
You're talking about something else now.	Uthetha ngenye into ngoku.
So, very good.	Ngoko, kuhle kakhulu.
It will be because he is not here.	Kuya kuba njalo kuba akakho apha.
There was nothing else to do.	Kwakungekho enye into yokwenza.
Just give me time.	Ndinike nje ixesha.
I did it.	ndiyenzile.
Thinking about having children can be very difficult.	Ukucinga ngokuba nabantwana kunokuba nzima ngakumbi.
Tell me about this situation.	Ndixelele ngale meko.
Don't say that.	Musa ukuyithetha loo nto.
I could not find your question here.	Andikwazanga ukufumana umbuzo wakho apha.
No one should know.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukwazi.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
I know now.	Ndiyakwazi ngoku.
He doesn't think about it.	Akacingi ngayo.
I didn't want that much.	Ndandingafuni nto ingako.
He went down once in a way.	Wehla kanye ngendlela.
He has rolled his eyes.	Uye waphuma amehlo.
That would be great.	Oko bekuya kuba kuhle.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye.
Check out my location.	Jonga indawo yam.
I can't wait to read all this.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda yonke le nto.
And, you know, you learn a lot of things.	Kwaye, uyazi, ufunda izinto ezininzi.
I knew why.	Ndandisazi ukuba kutheni.
How to do some things that.	Indlela yokwenza ezinye izinto ukuba.
Why you.	Kutheni wena.
I didn't do it.	khange ndiyenze.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba wayecinga ntoni.
Just before.	Kanye ngaphambili.
Looking forward.	Ndijonge phambili.
Just something happened.	Kanye into eyenzekayo.
I didn't want to talk to her either.	Nam ndandingafuni kuthetha naye.
But he wanted to do just one.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwenza enye kuphela.
You work in this area.	Usebenza kule ndawo.
You had better leave right away.	Kungcono uhambe kwangoko.
Except that.	Ngaphandle nje kokuba.
This should be the case now.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo okwangoku.
But you do not want to be frustrated if you cannot get the right pitch so invest in a good capo.	Kodwa awufuni ukuhamba kuyo yonke loo ngxaki.
No one ever said anything.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha nto.
I know you well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle.
But it is certainly not necessary.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akuyomfuneko.
All the way to the back.	Yonke indlela ngasemva.
You will try to find food.	Uza kuzama ukufumana ukutya.
We want to know what you think.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I think soon.	Ndicinga ukuba kungekudala.
Well, 'that' away.	Kulungile, 'ukuba' kude.
Not just everyone.	Kuphela ayinguye wonke umntu.
You know that you will arrive late.	Uyazi ukuba uza kufika emva kwexesha.
And now you have it.	Kwaye ngoku unayo.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.	Ukulinda, ukulinda, ukulinda.
There are other things.	Kukho ezinye izinto.
Or something else.	Okanye enye into.
But he knew he had to go.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
He never read a book.	Akazange afunde incwadi.
I never thought anyone would do that.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba nabani na uya kwenza.
It's your job.	Ngumsebenzi wakho.
It always is.	Kuhlala kunjalo.
It's too good to be true.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba kube njalo.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
This he did not.	Oku akenzanga.
Then he and I will talk about everything.	Emva koko mna naye siza kuthetha ngayo yonke into.
Nobody wants the truth.	Akukho mntu ufuna inyaniso.
He was optimistic.	Wayenethemba.
I just tried it now.	Ndazama nje ngoku.
I don't know what's in there.	Andazi ukuba kukho ntoni apho.
I wonder if it's true.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yinyani na.
It happened that way.	Kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
I wanted to say it.	Bendifuna ukuyithetha.
He came to my house after dinner.	Ufike kwam emva kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
He went out with us.	Waphuma kunye nathi.
And a woman.	Kwaye umfazi.
Now no one lived there.	Ngoku kwakungekho mntu uhlala apho.
He came to my office one day.	Weza eofisini yam ngenye imini.
No matter.	Noba kutheni.
He never did that.	Zange ayenze loo nto.
And certainly not.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
Now every day.	Ngoku yonke imihla.
Just tell me what you think.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Nice to have you here !.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nawe apha!.
My question is why you are interested.	Umbuzo wam kukuba kutheni unomdla.
But not in the right way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
Or better, for that matter.	Okanye ngcono, ngaloo nto.
It seemed to be going very well.	Kwakubonakala kuhamba kakuhle kakhulu.
We did that a little bit.	Senze loo nto kancinci.
I could not stop.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka.
Not a big deal or anything.	Hayi into enkulu okanye nantoni na.
I could not control myself.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba.
He's just a friend.	Ngumhlobo nje.
I think.	Ndiyacinga.
There is plenty of time !.	Kukho ixesha elininzi!.
Yes, you read that right.	Ewe, ufunda oko kulungile.
Although, this is not about me.	Nokuba, oku akukho malunga nam.
We will buy books.	Siza kuthenga iincwadi.
He wanted to do his job.	Wayefuna ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
And maybe no one ever told her.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akukho mntu wakha wamxelela.
I know you are a good person.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
He will go with you.	Uya kuhamba nawe.
Have you ever been to a restaurant?	Ngaba ukhe waya kwindawo yokutyela?
I never did that myself.	Zange ndiyenze lonto mna.
Sooner than you think.	Kungekudala kunokuba ucinga.
I didn't know why but at first.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni kodwa ekuqaleni.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
He didn't look very good.	Wayengabonakali kakuhle kakhulu.
Unless you have to.	Ngaphandle kokuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze.
But this is exactly what he wanted to know.	Kodwa oku kanye wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
And if he wasn't.	Kwaye ukuba wayengekho .
Her mother said she was a good person.	Umama wakhe uthe ungumntu omhle.
So way more.	Ngoko indlela ngakumbi.
My turn!	Ixesha lam!
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Ndandisazi ukuba wayesazi yonke into ngam.
I better stay here.	Ngcono ndihlale apha.
In all that way.	Kuyo yonke loo ndlela.
We want to know more about it.	Sifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngayo.
This is very clear!	Oku kucacile ngokwenene!
There was no one, only thing.	Kwakungekho mntu, kuphela into.
But he is not.	Kodwa akanjalo.
Moreover, it will be very painful.	Ngaphezu koko, kuya kuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
No.	Hayi.
Don't forget!	Ungalibali!
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
But, nothing.	Kodwa, akukho nto.
I do not believe so.	Andikholelwa ukuba kunjalo.
He just wants to be you.	Ufuna nje ukuba nguwe.
The food is good.	Ukutya kulungile.
You have a problem.	Unengxaki.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngaye.
One week.	Iveki enye.
I thought you were playing with me.	Bendicinga udlala nam.
It seems impossible to get a job there.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukufumana umsebenzi apho.
Because it is necessary.	Ngenxa yokuba kufuneka.
My mother was no better.	Umama wayengekho ngcono.
I thought.	Bendicinga.
He lay there thinking.	Walala wacinga.
He always arrives late.	Usoloko efika emva kwexesha.
He just wanted to see.	Wayefuna nje ukubona.
I know he is there.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ukhona.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Everyone is looking after their own things.	Wonke umntu ujonge izinto zakhe.
I want to be here and now.	Ndifuna ukuba lapha kwaye ngoku.
No one can be better than you.	Akukho mntu unokuba ngcono kunawe.
Impossible, but possible.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He told me that the bus would arrive soon.	Undixelele ukuba ibhasi iza kufika kungekudala.
Life without him or death with him.	Ubomi ngaphandle kwakhe okanye ukufa naye.
It could be here.	Inokuba lapha.
That is what he wants us to do.	Yiloo nto afuna siyenze.
This will take several hours.	Oku kuya kuthatha iiyure ezininzi.
Maybe this time it will be okay.	Mhlawumbi ngeli xesha kuya kuba kulungile.
I know you read hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufunda nzima.
That, and, and that.	Oko, kwaye, kwaye kunjalo.
We did so.	Senze njalo.
He would come.	Wayeza kuza.
If you try to do something, you will do it	Ukuba uzama ukwenza into, uya kuyenza
But I heard.	Kodwa ndive.
Whatever your thing.	Nokuba yintoni na into yakho.
They both went to that place.	Bobabini baya kuloo ndawo.
They say he did well.	Bathi wenza kakuhle.
He can read people.	Uyakwazi ukufunda abantu.
And my new book.	Kwaye incwadi yam entsha.
I didn't want to do this.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza le nto.
What did you do today at your job ?.	Wenze ntoni namhlanje emsebenzini wakho?.
He is a good son.	Unyana olungileyo.
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.	Ayizange yenzeke into enje kum ngaphambili.
Please wait a long time.	Nceda ulindele ukulinda ixesha elide.
But no later, not really.	Kodwa akukho kamva, hayi ngokwenene.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza oko.
I know something is wrong with you.	Ndiyayazi into engalunganga ngawe.
I'm not in this amount.	Andikho kule mali.
And he didn't, but.	Kwaye akazange enze, kodwa.
And yet he did not come.	Kwaye nangoko akazange eze.
And he didn't know what to do.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni na.
I do not care. 	Andikhathali. 
He told me everything.	Undixelele yonke into.
I wanted to stay, hear more.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala, ndive ngakumbi.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wamxelela.
Not until much later.	Hayi kude kube kamva kakhulu.
But he is a very strange man.	Kodwa yindoda engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I never thought much of it.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo.
Back there.	Emva phaya.
Not so much, maybe, but some.	Hayi kakhulu, mhlawumbi, kodwa abanye.
Thank you now.	Enkosi ngoku.
You, however, do not want to.	Wena, nangona kunjalo, awufuni.
Everything and everyone will be back.	Yonke into kwaye wonke umntu uya kubuya.
I don't see anything right now.	Andiboni kwanto ngoku.
Maybe he gave more time.	Mhlawumbi wanika ixesha elingakumbi.
I can't tell you when.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ukuba nini.
Before he knew it there was something wrong.	Ngaphambi kokuba azi ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
There is no way to have it all.	Akukho ndlela yokuba nayo yonke.
About you, about me.	Malunga nawe, malunga nam.
Good travel in the area.	Ukuhamba kakuhle kwindawo.
All day long.	Imini yonke.
Mom made dinner.	Umama wenze isidlo sangokuhlwa.
So he decided to go.	Ngoko, wagqiba kwelokuba aye apho.
I want you to go.	Ndifuna uhambe.
You told me that.	Undixelele lonto.
I had to speak.	Kwafuneka ndithethe.
He will not live alone.	Akayi kuhlala yedwa.
Do you think that you are coming to me?	Ucinga ukuba uza kum?
He started working, slowly.	Waqalisa ukusebenza, kancinci.
People live there a lot.	Abantu bahlala apho kakhulu.
And then, something bad happened.	Kwaye ke, kwenzeka into embi.
He did not even know what he would do if he did.	Wayengazi nokuba uza kwenza ntoni xa enjenjalo.
I can't imagine how difficult that would be.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba inokuba nzima kangakanani loo nto.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba iza kwenzeka.
Everyone looked up.	Wonke umntu wajonga phezulu.
He slept.	Walala.
So it should be easy.	Ngoko ke kufuneka kube lula.
How did you get to work in the morning?	Ufike njani emsebenzini ekuseni?
Finally he said one word.	Ekugqibeleni wathetha ilizwi elinye.
You are late for school!	Ufike emva kwexesha esikolweni!
I hope you will be able to come home soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kukwazi ukuza ekhaya kungekudala.
He says he is not, but.	Uthi uthi ayinguye, kodwa.
He has come this far.	Uye wafika le kude.
It's better that way.	Kungcono ngolo hlobo.
As for me.	Njengoko kum.
He wants to tell the truth.	Ufuna ukuthetha inyani.
What's happened.	Kwenzeke ntoni.
And me a little too.	Kwaye nam kancinci.
He really meant that.	Wayethetha loo nto ngenene.
I have to decide on that.	Kufuneka ndiyenze isigqibo kuloo nto.
Do not tell others right now.	Musa ukuxelela abanye okwangoku.
And he never talked about it.	Kwaye akazange athethe ngayo.
No thanks.	Hayi enkosi.
He ate a little.	Watya kancinci.
I really wanted to be with you.	Bendifuna ukuba nyani nawe.
She has gone to her bed.	Uye waya ebhedini yakhe.
It is your job to discover what that is and to bring it about.	Ngumsebenzi wakho ukuxelela wonke umntu yonke into.
This is my job going forward.	Lo ngumsebenzi wam ukuya phambili.
It could be anything.	Inokuba nantoni na.
I want to know what's going on here.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
You got it.	Unayo.
Eventually, he decided to try a different approach.	Ekugqibeleni, wagqiba ekubeni azame enye indlela.
That did not always happen.	Oko akuzange kwenzeke rhoqo.
This happens very often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
I don't have to sit down.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndihlale phantsi.
I want to know why.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
He went that way.	Wahamba ngaloo ndlela.
They will say no.	Baza kuthi hayi.
But, yes, that's all.	Kodwa, ewe, yiyo yonke loo nto.
He told me more about the accident.	Uye wandixelela ngakumbi ngale ngozi .
You did a great job !.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu!.
But he knew it was so.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kunjalo.
Not out here, not in this place.	Hayi apha ngaphandle, hayi kule ndawo.
But not much is happening.	Kodwa akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
Our little house.	Indlu yethu encinci.
I didn't even know how you felt.	Ndandingazi nokuba uziva njani.
I'm not sure what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenza ntoni.
It will be painful, for sure.	Kuya kuba buhlungu, ngokuqinisekileyo.
So there is something there.	Ngoko kukho into apho.
I was really thinking about you today.	Bendicinga ngawe namhlanje nyani.
Maybe that would be nice, though.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba kuhle, nangona kunjalo.
And of course you have.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo unayo.
Then next month.	Emva koko kwinyanga ezayo.
But that is probably a good thing.	Kodwa mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
But every day he spoke.	Kodwa yonke imihla wayethetha.
Thank you for your excellent work.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
That's right, in everything.	Kunjalo, kuyo yonke into.
I don't want to be anywhere, to be honest.	Andifuni kuba ndawo, ukuthetha inyani.
He really loves her.	Uyamthanda nyani.
Of course you can't.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awukwazi.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene oko.
Now, don't forget.	Ngoku, ungalibali.
But he was afraid.	Kodwa wayesoyika.
He ended the call.	Wagqiba umnxeba.
He did a great, great work.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu, omkhulu.
But he eventually apologized.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ekugqibeleni wacela uxolo.
He will make the decision.	Nguye oza kuthatha isigqibo.
I did not want that to happen.	Bendingafuni ukuba kube njalo.
Another woman probably.	Omnye umfazi mhlawumbi.
There was nothing to try again.	Kwakungekho nto ukuzama kwakhona.
She is fine.	Uhamba kakuhle.
He can never succeed.	Akanakuze aphumelele.
To be with you all day.	Ukuba nawe imini yonke.
He always arrives on time.	Usoloko efika ngexesha.
Well, maybe not all.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi yonke.
Well, that's a good thing.	Ke, yinto entle leyo.
To me, but you know, not really.	Kum, kodwa uyazi, hayi ngokwenene.
But it really isn't that hard.	Kodwa ngokwenene akukho nzima kangako.
Not that fun.	Hayi ukuba mnandi.
Right then, right there.	Kanye ngoko, kanye apho.
Quickly and quickly.	Ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
You know this is true.	Uyazi ukuba yinyani le.
I don’t know how I made it so.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani ukuba kube njalo.
To meet you like this.	Ukudibana nawe ngolu hlobo.
I do not want to wait.	Andifuni kulinda.
He did not want to be late.	Wayengafuni ukufika emva kwexesha.
To know more.	Ukwazi ngakumbi.
He pretended nothing to her.	Wayenza ngathi akukho nto kuye.
Everything about him, really.	Yonke into malunga naye, ngokwenene.
I know what the problem is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
In the end, you do it.	Ekugqibeleni, uyayenza.
Like, one.	Njengoko, enye.
I know where he lives.	Ndiyamazi apho ahlala khona.
Certainly that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
I can't wait to work.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukusebenza.
She went to the hospital.	Waya esibhedlele.
And, what else.	Kwaye, yintoni enye.
You should not be late for class.	Akufunekanga ufike emva kwexesha eklasini.
But and then.	Kodwa kwaye ngoko.
There is a cat in my bed.	Kukho ikati ebhedini yam.
You just need something to go.	Ufuna nje into ukuze uhambe.
Don't think about this.	Musa ukucinga ngale nto.
So she thought she was beautiful.	Ngoko wayecinga ukuba mhle.
There is no place for you here.	Akukho ndawo yakho apha.
I think that's very good.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu oko.
So thank you, me.	Ngoko enkosi, mna.
But then, for her, it probably happened.	Kodwa ke, kuye, mhlawumbi kwenzeka.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange.
In this case, too.	Kule meko, kakhulu.
No, of course not.	Akunjalo, kunjalo.
He spoke because he wanted to.	Wathetha kuba efuna.
Will my son become a doctor?	Ngaba unyana wam uza kuba ngugqirha?
I wanted to learn more.	Ndandifuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
That if you are interested at all.	Oko ukuba unomdla kwaphela.
He got it for three years.	Wafumana iminyaka emithathu ngayo.
It is not as easy as it seems.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
You're almost right.	Uphantse ukuba ulungile.
That's right.	Oko kunjalo.
I made breakfast.	Ndenze isidlo sakusasa.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa yinto eyenzekayo.
Maybe you should go with him?	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhambe naye?
Or maybe this one.	Okanye mhlawumbi lo.
Look behind me, right here.	Jonga emva kwam, kanye apha.
Not to you, but to you.	Hayi kuwe, kodwa kuwe.
This happens very quickly.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
And he didn't want another one.	Kwaye akazange afune enye.
This is very difficult, but possible.	Oku kunzima kakhulu, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
Thank you very much ahead of time.	Enkosi kakhulu phambi kwexesha.
If you already know, that's fine.	Ukuba sele uyazi, kuhle.
No one really knows.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene.
This is clearly difficult.	Oku ngokucacileyo kunzima.
He arrived missing.	Wafika engekho.
There is no situation.	Akukho meko.
Now he lives alone.	Ngoku uhlala yedwa.
Or really, question.	Okanye ngokwenene, umbuzo.
He wants to be a great player now.	Ufuna ukuba ngumdlali omkhulu ngoku.
Absolutely nothing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto ngokupheleleyo.
He wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna ukuba kunye naye.
Nothing to do with time.	Akukho nto yokwenza ixesha.
For now, that's right.	Okwangoku, kunjalo.
He knew exactly why.	Wayesazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
Nothing will happen to you, but you have to tell me.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka kuwe, kodwa kufuneka undixelele.
This one is for sure.	Lo uqinisekile.
You need to tell me something about yourself.	Kufuneka undixelele into ngawe.
Look how beautiful it is.	Jonga indlela entle ngayo.
He needed more time.	Wayefuna ixesha elingakumbi.
I never told you that.	Zange ndikuxelele lonto.
Some may.	Abanye kusenokwenzeka ukuba.
Well, now you have.	Ewe, ngoku wenze njalo.
There he stayed.	Apho wahlala.
I wanted to do something big.	Ndandifuna ukwenza into enkulu.
They always are.	Bahlala njalo.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekileyo.
Nobody lives alone.	Akukho mntu uhlala yedwa.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He refused to talk to her.	Akazange avume ukuthetha naye.
Good to know.	Kuhle ukwazi.
Tell me about your work.	Ndixelele ngomsebenzi wakho.
And so it should be.	Kwaye kunjalo kufuneka.
I think it's time.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha.
They will talk about it.	Baza kuthetha ngayo.
He apologized.	Wandicela uxolo.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke oko.
The accident happened yesterday.	Le ngozi yenzeke izolo.
You too in it.	Nawe kuyo.
I never thought about it at first.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo ekuqaleni.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I just came here.	Ndifike nje mna apha.
Help more, more.	Nceda ngakumbi, ngakumbi.
Well, now is our time.	Ewe, ngoku lixesha lethu.
There will always be something new to try.	Kuya kuhlala kukho into entsha ukuzama.
That's us.	Oko kuthi.
But not about this.	Kodwa hayi ngale nto.
Not just one gun.	Hayi nje umpu omnye.
I know it.	Ndiyayazi.
Now is the time to speak up.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba uthethe.
If you know where to look.	Ukuba uyazi ukuba ujonge phi.
Really the same thing.	Into efanayo ngokwenene.
You need to know something.	Kufuneka wazi into.
He said nothing about her.	Khange athethe nto ngaye.
No, really, you read that right.	Hayi, ngenene, ufunda oko kulungile.
Now, you have my answer.	Ngoku, unayo impendulo yam.
I made a speech.	Ndenza intetho.
Because there is something.	Kuba kukho into.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
And he should know.	Kwaye kufuneka azi.
He quickly opened the door.	Wavula ucango ngokukhawuleza.
Not just first.	Hayi nje kuqala.
You have to think.	Kufuneka ucinge.
Later again.	Emva kwexesha kwakhona.
You are driving very slowly!	Uqhuba kancinci kakhulu!
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
This is a little difficult.	Oku kunzima kancinci.
He told me he didn't know.	Wandixelela ukuba akazi.
Maybe you say no.	Mhlawumbi uthi hayi.
You have to have it.	Ufanele ube nayo.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
Now it is impossible.	Ngoku akunakwenzeka.
You, too, do not have to know everything.	Nawe, akufuneki wazi yonke into.
I know this is good.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kulungile.
And he wouldn't have it for long.	Kwaye wayengayi kuba nayo ixesha elide.
How long do we have to make a plan.	Lixesha elingakanani kufuneka senze icebo.
I never thought it was right.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ilungile.
Of course the passage of time is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukuhamba kwexesha kunokwenzeka.
Maybe reading.	Mhlawumbi ukufunda.
From these.	Ukusukela ezi.
Hard work, hard play.	Ukusebenza nzima, ukudlala nzima.
So he got a new job.	Ngoko wafumana umsebenzi omtsha.
He plays the piano.	Udlala ipiyano.
That's a small thing.	Yinto encinci leyo.
I can't say what.	Andikwazi kuthetha ntoni.
But he did not just walk away.	Kodwa akazange ahambe ecaleni nje.
It should not happen.	Akufanele kwenzeke.
He had to do so, he told her.	Kwafuneka enjenjalo, wamxelela.
So what ?.	Ngoko ke yintoni?.
Help me wait for it.	Ndincede ndilinde kuyo.
I have come before you.	ndize phambi kwakho.
I would like that too.	Ndingathanda nokuba.
He is not here today.	Akakho namhlanje.
He slept easily.	Walala lula.
That would come back, he thought.	Oko kuya kubuya, wacinga.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Zange athethe nto ixesha elide.
You should be well aware of that.	Ufanele ukuba uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
Then you try something else.	Emva koko uzama enye into.
He is always like that.	Usoloko enjalo.
As soon as he arrives he will start work.	Xa efika nje uya kuqala umsebenzi.
He has done a lot.	Wenze okuninzi.
He did not do well.	Akenzanga kakuhle.
Not a little bit.	Hayi kancinci kancinci.
He seemed to have no chance.	Wayebonakala ukuba akanalo ithuba.
I have done many things.	Ndenze izinto ezininzi.
You have your place and that is it.	Unayo indawo yakho kwaye yiloo nto.
He did not help.	Akazange ancede.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
I want it done with it.	Ndifuna yenziwe ngayo.
But this is for us.	Kodwa oku kuthi.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
Not so everywhere, though.	Akunjalo kuyo yonke indawo, nangona kunjalo.
Not to be outdone.	Hayi ukuhamba ngamandla.
You will do well in everything.	Uya kwenza kakuhle kuyo yonke into.
I know that's it.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinto leyo.
He entered the office and quickly left.	Wangena eofisini waza wemka ngokukhawuleza.
He was not alone at this time.	Wayengekho yedwa ngeli xesha.
I can't buy this.	Andikwazi ukuthenga oku.
Not true.	Hayi inyaniso.
I thought there was a mistake.	Bendicinga ukuba kukho impazamo.
He is not like that now.	Akanjalo nangoku.
Does this mean the same thing?	Ngaba oku kuthetha into enye.
Frightened, he ran away.	Woyika, wabaleka wemka.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Not this job.	Hayi lo msebenzi.
But no one wanted to go.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayefuna ukuya.
You will not go wrong.	Awuyi kuhamba kakubi.
I could not.	Andikwazanga kunjalo.
Then he asked why he wanted me.	Emva koko wabuza ukuba kutheni efuna mna.
It is difficult to read every day.	Kunzima ukufunda ngayo yonke imihla.
This happened, however, later.	Oku kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo, kamva.
This is exactly what you seem to be doing.	Yile nto kanye ubonakala uyenza.
And if you want that.	Kwaye ukuba ufuna ukuba.
He also did nothing.	Kwakhona akazange enze nto.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kwam.
Traveling becomes difficult.	Ukuhamba kuba nzima.
You need to do a test now.	Kufuneka wenze uvavanyo ngoku.
He talked to her.	Wathetha naye .
I love it there.	Ndiyayithanda apho.
Look at the father.	Jonga utata.
Eventually, he “learned to walk again”.	Ekugqibeleni, "wafunda ukuhamba kwakhona".
I don't care how it is.	Andikhathali ukuba njani.
If you want this, fine.	Ukuba ufuna oku, kulungile.
He said yes, you can't go alone.	Wathi ewe, awukwazi ukuhamba wedwa.
This job requires a lot of money.	Lo msebenzi ufuna imali eninzi.
I love my way.	Ndiyayithanda indlela yam.
But he did nothing.	Kodwa akenzanga nto.
He will not have to.	Akayi kufuneka.
I just want to talk to you.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha nawe.
I enjoy doing this work.	Ndiyavuya ukwenza lo msebenzi.
I wanted a story.	Bendifuna ibali.
I knew exactly what had happened, but.	Ndandisazi kakuhle ukuba kwenzeke ntoni, kodwa.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo ukuba awufuni.
And he died instantly.	Kwaye wafa ngoko nangoko.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
That's how great it is.	Yiyo indlela enkulu ngayo.
He did a lot with it.	Wenza kakhulu ngayo.
I want to sing.	Ndifuna ukucula.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi, akunjalo.
And maybe there, we'll get another chance.	Kwaye mhlawumbi apho, siya kufumana elinye ithuba.
The fact is.	Inyaniso kukuba .
You will stay here.	Uza kuhlala apha.
Not just the whole test.	Hayi nje lonke uvavanyo.
I would really like.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene.
It wasn't much.	Kwakungekho nto ingako.
What would he do with it ?.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni ngayo?.
I know it's hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima.
We'll be back tonight.	Siza kubuya ngoku ngokuhlwa.
Do you mean he did it.	Ngaba uthetha ukuba wakwenza.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke into enjalo.
Because this is moving fast.	Kuba oku kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele.
I will never tell you again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndikuxelele.
But he sat down.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi.
Good thing here.	Into entle apha.
For a long time, it seems.	Ixesha elide, kubonakala.
I am the only one here.	Ndim ndedwa apha.
He tried desperately to think of something else.	Wazama ngamandla ukucinga ngenye into.
However, something needs to be done,	Nangona kunjalo, kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe,
I'm a little tired.	Ndidiniwe kancinci.
Then he looked up at the school.	Emva koko wajonga phezulu esikolweni.
Or just talking.	Okanye ukuthetha nje.
Probably, but it is not.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa akunjalo.
I thought we were going to do it.	Ndandicinga ukuba siza kuyenza.
But it is much better.	Kodwa kungcono kakhulu.
Just another thing for you to go well.	Enye nje into yokuba uhambe kakuhle.
I don't know if that's right.	Andazi ukuba kunjalo na.
We did just that.	Senze kanye loo nto.
He may not like it at all.	Usenokuba akayithandi loo nto.
And he wanted with her.	Kwaye wayefuna kunye naye.
He wanted to work harder.	Wayefuna ukusebenza ngakumbi.
I want you so much.	Ndifuna wena kakhulu.
You do not think clearly.	Awucingi ngokucacileyo.
He did not know many things.	Wayengazi izinto ezininzi.
Better no, better no.	Kungcono hayi, ngcono hayi.
It has not been easy to think clearly.	Akuzange kube lula ukucinga ngokucacileyo.
Yes, he went to the hospital.	Ewe, waya esibhedlele.
But two things.	Kodwa izinto ezimbini.
They will do anything.	Baya kwenza nantoni na.
Again this is good.	Kwakhona oku kulungile.
He did all the work.	Wenza wonke umsebenzi.
Now they will be able to see clearly.	Ngoku baya kukwazi ukubona ngokucacileyo.
Just a few questions.	Imibuzo embalwa nje.
She went to the hospital.	Uye esibhedlele.
Music is better.	Umculo ungcono.
No one knows for sure, it is impossible to know.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
We will come to you.	Siza kuza kuwe.
What could that be?	Inokuba yintoni loo nto.
Or you like it.	Okanye uyayithanda.
You can not do this again.	Awunako ukwenza oku kwakhona.
It's a big deal now.	Yinto enkulu ngoku.
My mother did.	Umama wenza njalo.
Even me.	Nokuba ndim.
You have this.	Unayo le.
I know we never did.	Ndiyazi ukuba asizange siyenze.
So two things.	Ngoko izinto ezimbini.
There is no one at home except me.	Akukho mntu ekhaya ngaphandle kwam.
And of course yes.	Kwaye kunjalo ewe.
The best one, too.	Enye engcono, nayo.
No one needs to help her.	Akukho mntu kufuneka amncede.
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
My life, his life.	Ubomi bam, ubomi bakhe.
It will take many days.	Kuya kuthatha iintsuku ezininzi.
It just has to be true.	Kufuneka kube yinyani kuphela.
We just know.	Siyazi nje.
And you have to be.	Kwaye kufuneka ube njalo.
Then he made it happen.	Emva koko wenza ukuba kwenzeke.
He learned because he was afraid.	Wafunda ngenxa yokuba wayesoyika.
Maybe we'll wait a long time.	Mhlawumbi siza kulinda ixesha elide.
I think you did something wrong.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into embi.
I will definitely try this soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiza kuzama oku kungekudala.
He started eating his lunch.	Waqalisa ukutya isidlo sakhe sasemini.
And for breakfast.	Kwaye ngesidlo sakusasa.
I'm just glad to have you.	Ndiyavuya nje ukuba nawe.
At first, that's right.	Ekuqaleni, kunjalo.
Look at the gun.	Jonga umpu.
And no one is going to have to tell me.	Kwaye akukho mntu kuya kufuneka andixelele.
The picture stays with me.	Umfanekiso uhlala kum.
Well, one did.	Ewe, omnye wenza.
I want to do something, be human.	Ndifuna ukwenza into, ndibe ngumntu.
I don't have to say anything else.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe enye into.
I have to look into it.	Kufuneka ndijonge kuyo.
I think you have a problem.	Ndicinga ukuba unengxaki.
We will go with it.	Siza kuhamba ngayo.
He says he can't do that.	Uthi akanakuyenza loo nto.
There was not much there.	Kwakungekho nto ingako apho.
And other than that.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko.
That means everything.	Oko kuthetha yonke into.
He thinks he will be a great thing.	Ucinga ukuba uya kuba yinto enkulu.
I want to get out more.	Ndifuna ukuphuma ngakumbi.
He pulled out a big book.	Wakhupha incwadi enkulu.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngawe.
Going to work.	Ukuya emsebenzini.
I'm sure you know about it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi ngayo.
I didn't know you were here in the house.	Bendingayazi ukuba ulapha endlini.
Everyone came down with it.	Wonke umntu wehla nayo.
He won't talk about it.	Akayi kuthetha ngayo.
I'll have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
Then he started walking.	Waza waqalisa ukuhamba.
But tell me what you think !.	Kodwa ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni!.
He would be something.	Wayeza kuba yinto.
A really big house.	Indlu enkulu ngokwenene.
I thought you wanted to know.	Bendicinga ukuba uyafuna ukwazi.
Tom looked away.	UTom wajonga ecaleni.
How about that.	Njani ngalonto.
Inside me.	Ngaphakathi kwam.
He never had it, though.	Akazange abe nayo, nangona kunjalo.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho into eninzi ngakumbi kuyo.
You have to do better.	Kufuneka wenze ngcono.
He must be angry.	Kufuneka abe nomsindo.
Just here and go.	Nje apha kwaye uhambe.
I can't really talk right now.	Andikwazi nyani ukuthetha ngoku.
This is clearly not possible.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
Obviously, you will find the error.	Ngokucacileyo, uya kufumana impazamo.
She told him.	Wamxelela.
Nothing of yours here.	Akukho nto yakho apha.
The problem is you.	Ingxaki nguwe.
Everyone seems to be talking at the moment.	Wonke umntu ubonakala ethetha ngelo xesha.
The truth is, no one really knows.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
We will make it easier to work.	Siza kwenza kube lula ukusebenza.
You need to know.	Kuya kufuneka wazi.
This will seem to us.	Oku kuya kubonakala ngathi.
Please be here.	Nceda ube apha.
You did that.	Nguwe owenze loo nto.
Are you ok?	Ingaba ulungile?
And now what.	Ke ngoku yintoni.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba lapha.
He needed time to be alone.	Wayefuna ixesha lokuba yedwa.
I know this is not going to happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku akuyi kwenzeka.
Tell mom you will be there.	Xelela umama uzakuba khona.
It has to be done.	Kufuneka yenziwe.
I can't tell anyone.	Andikwazi ukuxelela mntu.
We will have to go to him.	Kuya kufuneka siye kuye.
Now you will be.	Ngoku uya kuba.
No, not us.	Hayi, hayi kuthi.
But maybe you want to go, go home.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ufuna ukuhamba, ukuya ekhaya.
You will see your parents soon.	Uza kubona abazali bakho kungekudala.
You have been working on it for a long time.	Kudala usebenza kuyo.
He has to go by himself.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokwakhe.
You know.	Uziva .
Reading in bed.	Ukufunda ebhedini.
We will be back soon.	Siza kubuya ngokukhawuleza.
If you exist, death does not exist.	Ukuba ukhona, ukufa akukho.
Too many years.	Iminyaka emininzi kakhulu.
I would like more.	Ndingathanda ngakumbi.
Well no more.	Kulungile hayi ngakumbi.
Very good though.	Kuhle kakhulu nangona.
He has tried everything.	Uye wazama yonke into.
Trying to be anywhere but right there, with him.	Ukuzama ukuba nayiphi na indawo kodwa kanye apho, kunye naye.
It seemed he wanted to be me, but better.	Kwakubonakala ukuba wayefuna ukuba ndim, kodwa ngcono.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Ndandifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Yes, he will.	Ewe ngokuqinisekileyo uya kukwenza oko.
He would succeed later, when he was alone.	Wayeza kuphumelela kamva, xa eyedwa.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza kuyenza kwakhona ngokuqinisekileyo.
If so, we do not need to do anything.	Ukuba kunjalo, akukho mfuneko yokuba senze nto.
So why did you do that?	Ngoko kutheni uyenzile loo nto?
Thus,.	Ngaloo ndlela, .
There is something in that.	Kukho into kuloo nto.
Nobody ever did, then or after.	Akukho mntu wakha wenza, ngoko okanye emva koko.
You better come with me.	Kungcono uze nawe.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yenziwe.
But no, it is not.	Kodwa hayi, ayinguye.
My mother, however, has done it.	Umama nangona kunjalo, uyenzile.
However, that is not likely enough.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akunakwenzeka ngokwaneleyo.
At last! 	Ekugqibeleni!
I want to know how and why and when.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba njani kwaye kutheni kwaye nini.
And no, it's not.	Kwaye hayi, akunjalo.
And alone.	Kwaye yedwa.
I would like to know the best way to do this.	Ndingathanda ukwazi indlela engcono yokwenza oku.
But no.	Kodwa hayi .
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe nam.
And okay once you know.	Kwaye kulungile xa sele uyazi.
I know it .	Ndiyayazi .
Moreover, he said.	Ngaphezu koko, wathi.
Then he became her friend.	Emva koko waba ngumhlobo wakhe.
That ended quickly.	Oko kwaphela ngokukhawuleza.
Or go again.	Okanye uhambe kwakhona.
Now, he did.	Ngoku, wenze njalo.
Or me.	Okanye nam.
He made a lot of people.	Wenza abantu abaninzi.
Yes, there is.	Ewe, kukho.
Probably not one or the other.	Mhlawumbi hayi enye okanye enye.
But not a question.	Kodwa hayi umbuzo.
He wanted to get out of the house again.	Wayefuna ukuphuma kwakhona endlwini.
But we have to do it.	Kodwa kufuneka senze njalo.
Nobody lives where you want to go.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho ufuna khona.
But he was not angry.	Kodwa akazange abe nomsindo.
Why should you know?	Kutheni kufuneka ukwazi?
When there is a problem, the police come quickly.	Xa kukho ingxaki, amapolisa eza ngokukhawuleza.
He never talked about her.	Zange athethe ngaye.
Otherwise go or wait.	Ngaphandle koko uhamba okanye ulinde.
Not just me.	Hayi mna kuphela.
Two things inside.	Izinto ezimbini ngaphakathi.
I look at music the same way.	Ndijonge umculo ngendlela efanayo.
Maybe it's better this way.	Mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
The longer, the better.	Ixesha elide, ngcono.
You have to do one.	Kufuneka wenze enye.
I don't know either.	Andikwazi nam.
We will be back tomorrow.	Siza kubuya ngomso.
I am not sure about this question.	Andiqinisekanga ngalo mbuzo.
He may be my best friend.	Inokuba ngumhlobo wam olungileyo kakhulu.
A few days maybe.	Iintsuku ezimbalwa mhlawumbi.
To be done.	Ukuze yenziwe.
And there are many more.	Kwaye kukho izinto ezininzi.
There was no reason.	Kwakungekho sizathu.
I know not much.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho kakhulu.
Coffee did not happen.	Ikofu ayizange yenzeke.
So, will you go with me?	Ke, uza kuhamba nam?
I did not know better.	Ndandingazi ngcono.
She has been discharged from the hospital.	Uye waphuma esibhedlele.
And we need to know this.	Kwaye kufuneka siyazi oku.
A marriage has taken place.	Kwenzeke umtshato.
I went to him.	Ndaya kuye.
Maybe it's better to take a few days.	Mhlawumbi kungcono ukuthatha iintsuku ezimbalwa.
So in the end, he goes alone.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni, uhamba yedwa.
Then a few more.	Emva koko ezinye ezimbalwa.
And that is our job.	Kwaye ngumsebenzi wethu lowo.
He ran down the road.	Wabaleka wehla ngendlela.
So maybe.	Ngoko mhlawumbi.
That's a quick thought.	Nantso ukucinga ngokukhawuleza.
Another three years.	Enye iminyaka emithathu.
It has to happen.	Kufuneka kwenzeke.
They are everywhere, especially when there are people.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo, ngakumbi xa kukho abantu.
You did it just a little bit, if you want to know the truth.	Uyenze nje kancinci, ukuba ufuna ukwazi inyaniso.
He lives at home.	Uhlala ekhaya.
But it will take time.	Kodwa kuya kuthatha ixesha.
Obviously not you.	Ngokucacileyo hayi kuwe.
That death would not be pleasant.	Ukuba ukufa akuyi kuba mnandi.
One learns by making mistakes.	Umntu ufunda ngokwenza iimpazamo.
I had no idea that anyone was doing that.	Ndandingazi ukuba umntu wenza loo nto ngokwenene.
The only question is how soon.	Umbuzo kuphela kukuba kungekudala kangakanani.
Later, he thought.	Kamva, wacinga.
No, many.	Hayi, abaninzi.
And to me the other way around.	Ke kum ngenye indlela.
He just didn't want to.	Wayengafuni nje.
It will always be and always will be.	Kuya kuhlala kunjalo kwaye kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
Or something of mine.	Okanye into yam.
And this is so.	Kwaye oku kunjalo.
Far from it.	Kude ngokuqinisekileyo.
As for? 	Ngoko?
I'm just trying to be myself.	Ndizama nje ukuba ndim.
However, it is good to think.	Nangona kunjalo, kuhle ukucinga.
It only takes a long time.	Kuthatha nje ixesha elide.
I do not believe it.	Andikholelwa kodwa.
You know the problem.	Uyayazi ingxaki.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye kanye.
That will continue to be the case.	Oko kuya kuqhubeka kunjalo.
I apologize earlier.	Ndiyaxolisa ngaphambili.
He was talking like that.	Wayethetha ngolo hlobo.
I just want a home.	Ndifuna nje ekhaya.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
In this case, that's fine.	Kule meko, kulungile.
He talks a lot about his work.	Uthetha kakhulu ngomsebenzi wakhe.
Some of your questions.	Imibuzo yakho ethile.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze naloo nto.
Not just work, but everything.	Hayi nje umsebenzi, kodwa yonke into.
No look forward.	Hayi jonga phambili.
We need to act immediately.	Kufuneka senze ngoko nangoko.
He arrived home late at night.	Ufike ebusuku kakhulu ekhaya.
He has run away a lot.	Uye wabaleka kakhulu.
That's what it is today, not a girl.	Nantso ke into namhlanje, hayi intombi.
I want to be human.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu.
I want him to do it.	Ndifuna ayenze.
I know a lot of people.	Ndiyazi abantu abaninzi.
You arrived just in time.	Ufike kanye ngexesha.
You know exactly why.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
Well, not you.	Ewe, hayi wena.
So we did not.	Ngoko asizange.
This could be anything.	Oku kunokuba nantoni.
That's the problem.	Nantso ingxaki.
If you want to play, you will need the ball.	Ukuba ufuna ukudlala, uya kufuna ibhola.
I can do that, no problem.	Ndingayenza loo nto, akukho ngxaki.
He is coming after me.	Uza emva kwam.
But now you know that it is not easy.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi ukuba akukho lula.
But that's okay, you don't want everyone.	Kodwa oko kulungile, awufuni wonke umntu.
Three hours. 	Iiyure ezintathu. 
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
However, that can be a good thing.	Kodwa ke, inokuba yinto entle leyo.
I can't say anything right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto okwangoku.
I don’t think it’s going to be that hard.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangako.
You like it here.	Uyayithanda apha.
In that, there is nothing.	Kuloo nto, akukho nto.
I never heard from again.	Khange ndiphinde ndive.
This must be okay.	Oku kumele ukuba kulungile.
It would certainly be nice to see more of him.	Ngokuqinisekileyo bekuya kuba kuhle ukubona ngakumbi kuye.
You eat breakfast in the morning	Utya isidlo sakusasa kusasa
You did a really good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle ngokwenene.
I knew then.	Ndandisazi ngoko.
If you did, you know.	Ukuba uyenzile, uyazi.
Eventually he could not wait any longer.	Ekugqibeleni akazange akwazi ukulinda kwakhona.
You just know what's going on.	Uyazi nje ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He will go with us.	Uza kuhamba nathi.
I love it I love it.	Ndiyayithanda ndiyayithanda.
Maybe someone knows more.	Mhlawumbi umntu wazi ngakumbi.
I have never seen it before.	Andizange ndibone ngaphambili.
And for a long time nothing happened.	Kwaye ixesha elide akukho nto eyenzekayo.
My dog ​​will stay with me.	Inja yam iya kuhlala nam.
I do it every day.	Ndenza yonke imihla.
If her mother is not there, you are not going.	Ukuba umama wakhe akakho, awuyi.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Akafuni kuthetha ngayo.
This is a wonderful thing this week.	Yinto entle kakhulu le kule veki.
He said there was no question.	Wathi akukho mbuzo.
He arrived late, for sure.	Wafika emva kwexesha, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He went out to talk to her.	Waphuma waya kuthetha nayo.
It's just a thing.	Yinto nje.
And that happened.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka.
He seemed strange.	Wayebonakala engaqhelekanga.
Good luck !!.	Uhambe kakuhle!!.
This would be very unusual.	Oku bekuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
Like something was wrong with me.	Ngathi kukho into engalunganga kum.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni na.
No one asked.	Akukho mntu wabuza.
You know.	Waziva.
Once you will have to do it.	Kanye kuya kufuneka wenze.
He never spoke again and there was no need.	Akazange aphinde athethe kwaye kwakungekho mfuneko.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza oku.
We did very well.	Senze kakuhle kakhulu.
He decided to move on.	Wagqiba ekubeni aye phambili.
I'm trying to find a way to do that.	Ndizama ukufumana indlela yokwenza oko.
You know the place.	Uyayazi indawo.
Or not so much at this time.	Okanye hayi kakhulu ngeli xesha.
But he has gone.	Kodwa uye.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
He came in himself.	Wangena ngokwakhe.
Same problem.	Ingxaki efanayo.
It seems he did it and then he did it himself.	Kubonakala ngathi uyenzile emva koko wenza ngokwakhe.
I don't want to know.	Andifuni kukwazi.
But did it really.	Kodwa ngaba ngokwenene.
That did not happen.	Oko akuzange kube yinyani.
He was afraid to go to prison.	Wayesoyika ukuya entolongweni.
He can't get a job.	Akakwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
He looked bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi.
In this case, it is not.	Kule meko, akunjalo.
I don't understand anything after that.	Andiqondi nto emva koko.
Because he is here.	Ngokuba elapha.
I do not know.	Andazi kodwa.
Great place, great place.	Indawo enkulu, indawo entle.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu.
This is until tomorrow today.	Oku kube kude kube kusasa namhlanje.
You have to come tomorrow.	Kufuneka ufike kusasa.
I want a big answer.	Ndifuna impendulo enkulu.
Another problem.	Enye ingxaki.
But enough to say.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukuthetha.
I'll get one soon.	Ndiza kufumana enye ngokukhawuleza.
You know your way around the house.	Uyayazi indlela yakho apha endlini.
But we need to move faster.	Kodwa kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
You and your children.	Wena nabantwana bakho.
Although perhaps not.	Nangona mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I think this is true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani le.
He never thought of her.	Akazange acinge ngaye.
This book is this book.	Le ncwadi yile ncwadi.
It is something that will stay with us.	Yinto eza kuhlala nathi.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
He took his time doing so.	Wathatha ixesha lakhe ekwenza oko.
I would like something else.	Ndingathanda enye into.
You look busy.	Ubonakala uxakekile.
I do not believe.	Andikholelwa.
And we did well.	Kwaye senze kakuhle.
He always knows.	Wazi njalo.
With this book.	Ngale ncwadi.
Yeah, not very, really.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu, kunjalo.
It always is, it always will be.	Kuhlala kunjalo, kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
And more children.	Kwaye abantwana ngakumbi.
Not a car.	Hayi imoto.
You have never done this before.	Awuzange wenze le nto ngaphambili.
I decided to read another book.	Ndiye ndagqiba ekubeni ndifunde enye incwadi.
I just know the place.	Ndiyazi nje indawo.
We want something new, new.	Sifuna into entsha, entsha.
He entered the house.	Wangena endlini.
At the moment he is afraid to do the job.	Okwangoku uyoyika ukwenza umsebenzi.
You don't even have to think about it.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba ucinge ngayo.
I would like to tell her mom about it too.	Ndingathanda ukuxelela umama wakhe ngaloo nto naye.
You are better than me today.	Ungcono kunam namhlanje.
You too, or stop.	Nawe, okanye yeka.
That will make your job a lot easier.	Oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula kakhulu.
Either way, it will happen.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, iya kwenzeka.
You will be, too.	Uya kuba, nawe.
He will not return.	Akayi kubuya.
I doubt a lot of people.	Ndiyathandabuza abantu abaninzi.
Maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi.
Not me, not our daughter.	Hayi mna, hayi intombi yethu.
But he is not here, and you are still here.	Kodwa akakho ngoku, kwaye nawe ulapha.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
To read.	Ukufunda.
This is not easy at all.	Oku akukho lula konke konke.
The woman wanted to see.	Umfazi wayefuna ukubona.
But you do not have to decide this question.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukwenza isigqibo ngalo mbuzo.
That is not fun at all.	Akukho mnandi kwaphela oko.
And it takes two.	Kwaye kuthatha ezimbini.
So he is.	Ngoko unjalo.
There was no place in front of me.	Kwakungekho ndawo phambi kwam.
I wanted him to do anything and everything.	Ndandifuna enze nantoni na nayo yonke into.
That would be great.	Kuya kuba kuhle oko.
This time a girl.	Ngeli xesha intombi.
He is not real, he is not.	Akakho nyani, akakho.
It will take years to do that.	Kuya kuthatha iminyaka ukwenza oko.
I don’t know what I did with it completely.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngayo ngokupheleleyo.
Well, this is good for me.	Ewe, oku kulungile kum.
He read this for years.	Wafunda le nto iminyaka.
It will have to be tonight.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kube ngokuhlwanje.
I never thought of it that way.	Andizange ndicinge ngolu hlobo.
I just don't know about that.	Andazi nje ngalonto.
So you go to it.	Ngoko uya kuyo.
I would like very much.	Ndingathanda kakhulu.
I do not know when or how or why.	Andazi ukuba nini okanye njani okanye kutheni.
But he decided to tell the truth.	Kodwa ke wagqiba ekubeni athethe inyani nje.
So this book is good for me.	Ngoko le ncwadi ilungile kum.
I mean, he's really good.	Ndithetha ukuba ulungile ngokwenene.
It is difficult to talk about what you are talking about.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngale nto uthetha ngayo.
Nobody wants this.	Akukho mntu ufuna oku.
Everyone agreed that it was a coincidence.	Wonke umntu wavuma ukuba yinto eyenzekileyo.
It should not be so difficult.	Akufanele kube nzima kangako.
There is nothing wrong with being human.	Akukho nto ngokuba ngumntu.
You did such a good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle ngolo hlobo.
It's only here.	Kukho kuphela apha.
He fell asleep early.	Walala kwangethuba.
He can't do such a thing.	Akanakuyenza into enjalo.
And that means something.	Kwaye oko kuthetha into.
Thank you, everyone.	Enkosi, wonke umntu.
Who plays who.	Ngubani udlala ngubani.
I can't play with any of them.	Andikwazi ukudlala nayo nayiphi na enye.
It's harder than it seems at first.	Kunzima kunokuba kubonakala ekuqaleni.
But very well.	Kodwa kakuhle kakhulu.
He was no more.	Akazange abe ngaphezu koko.
Eventually the performance will be good.	Ekugqibeleni ukusebenza kuya kuba kuhle.
I can't go far here.	Andikwazi ukuya kude apha.
I think everyone needs it too !.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka naye!.
The other woman looked at me.	Wajonga kum omnye umfazi.
He picked up his gun.	Wathatha umpu wakhe.
I did not know how or when we would return.	Ndandingazi ukuba siza kubuya njani okanye nini.
You have to do the work.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi.
That morning.	Ngaloo ntsasa.
And that wasn’t because of me.	Kwaye oko kwakungekho ngenxa yam.
At that point you have to make a decision.	Ngelo xesha kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
He arrived early.	Wafika ngaphambi kwexesha.
He will never do anything else.	Akasayi kuphinda aqhube kwanto.
I told you the truth.	Ndikuxelele inyaniso.
So tell me this.	Ke ndixelele oku.
We all know that nothing will happen.	Sonke siyazi ukuba akukho nto iya kwenzeka.
He was thinking the other way.	Wayecinga ngenye indlela.
That's a long time.	Lixesha elide elo.
No food, though.	Akukho kutya, nangona kunjalo.
He did not speak.	Akazange athethe.
I hope to meet you there.	Ndiyathemba ukudibana nawe apho.
He wanted to do this himself.	Wayefuna ukwenza oku ngokwakhe.
You drive very fast in this situation.	Uqhuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu kule meko.
Not music, but something.	Hayi umculo, kodwa into.
Making a mistake is a person.	Ukwenza impazamo ngumntu.
And then one, and one, and one.	Kwaye ke enye, kwaye enye, kwaye enye.
You are lucky for him.	Unethamsanqa kuye.
He wanted to drive.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba.
But yes, it is possible.	Kodwa ewe, kunokwenzeka.
Therefore,.	Ngoko ke, .
But you have not been here all this time.	Kodwa awuzange ube lapha ngalo lonke elo xesha.
His life, his work.	Ubomi bakhe, umsebenzi wakhe.
We want to do it.	Sifuna ukuyenza.
But there is more food.	Kodwa kukho ukutya okuninzi.
One has to learn.	Omnye kufuneka afunde.
He felt clear.	Waziva ngokucacileyo.
The truth is, he did not want to do that.	Inyaniso kukuba akazange afune ukwenza njalo.
You will stay here a long time.	Uza kuhlala ixesha elide apha.
Not together, of course.	Hayi kunye, kunjalo.
Please speak clearly.	Ndicela uthethe ngokucacileyo.
I shouldn’t have looked.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ndijonge.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akukho.
Before reaching his house, he saw flowers.	Ngaphambi kokuba afike endlwini, wabona iintyatyambo.
That's right, who is that.	Kunjalo, ngubani lowo.
Do you also know about.	Ngaba naye uyazi malunga.
But no one tried to do it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wazama ukuyenza.
He stayed there all day.	Wayehlala apho imini yonke.
He ate lunch alone.	Watya isidlo sasemini yedwa.
The food is good.	Ukutya kwesidlo kulungile.
He said he wanted more time.	Wathi ufuna ixesha elininzi.
Maybe someone else should try to talk to her.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu kufuneka azame ukuthetha naye.
Have you ever tried this?	Ngaba ukhe wazama oku?
You think.	Ucinga.
I'm scared, please help!	Ndiyoyika, ndicela uncedo!
No, we did not.	Hayi, asizange senze njalo.
You bought a nice new house.	Uthenge indlu entle entsha.
Whoever it is.	Nokuba ngubani na.
Neither will we.	Nathi asiyi kuba njalo.
Then three.	Emva koko abathathu.
I did not look down.	Khange ndijonge phantsi.
Not so with him.	Akunjalo nayo.
Probably his whole week.	Mhlawumbi iveki yakhe yonke.
That would be strange.	Oko kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
This is me.	Ndim lo.
We need to do this well.	Kuya kufuneka siyenze kakuhle le nto.
Everything about you.	Yonke into ngawe.
Very much.	Kakhulu, kakhulu.
In the long run.	Ngexesha elide.
He is there too.	Ukhona kwakhona.
He has stayed.	Uye wahlala .
I can imagine why.	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni.
Good question.	Umbuzo olungileyo.
I know exactly where you are going.	Ndiyazi kakuhle apho uya khona.
But it is a much bigger job.	Kodwa ngumsebenzi omkhulu ngakumbi.
If he ran away.	Ukuba wabaleka.
But you better do it right away.	Kodwa kungcono uyenze ngokukhawuleza.
Something you need to know.	Into ekufuneka uyazi.
The question is how to do it.	Umbuzo kukuba ukwenza njani oko.
You know, flowers.	Uyazi, iintyatyambo.
I have done a very bad thing.	Ndenze into embi kakhulu.
Not another week.	Hayi enye iveki.
I will not, however.	Andiyi, nangona kunjalo.
I'm not sure what to expect.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ulindele ntoni.
Because now he was afraid.	Kuba ngoku wayesoyika.
He retired early.	Wathatha umhlala-phantsi kwangethuba.
It is impossible to do other things.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza ezinye izinto.
He left immediately.	Wemka ngokukhawuleza.
Anyone.	Nabani na.
But neither of us wants to be his friend again.	Kodwa akukho namnye kuthi ofuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe kwakhona.
But today it is not easy.	Kodwa namhlanje akukho lula.
He did though.	Uyenzile nangona kunjalo.
I didn’t stay home with the kids enough.	Khange ndihlale ekhaya nabantwana ngokwaneleyo.
We want to help you.	Sifuna ukukunceda.
I tried to read some.	Ndazama ukufunda ezinye.
This or that is nothing.	Yile nto okanye akukho nto.
We will do the right thing.	Siza kwenza into elungileyo.
But in this case, it is not.	Kodwa kule meko, akunjalo.
Yes, for our sakes.	Ewe, ngenxa yethu.
It will happen.	Kuya kwenzeka.
I am sure he is a good friend.	Ndiqinisekile ngumhlobo olungileyo.
Don't talk about him after him.	Musa ukuthetha ngaye emva kwakhe.
I told her everything.	Ndiye ndamxelela yonke into.
One must know.	Umntu kufuneka azi.
Don't just go there.	Musa nje ukuya apho.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
And you have succeeded.	Kwaye uphumelele.
Too much money.	Imali eninzi kakhulu.
Now he had to stay in the car.	Ngoku kwafuneka ahlale emotweni.
You will not need anything else.	Awuyi kufuna enye into.
I'm so sorry for that.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngaloo nto.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
No one came to see what was happening.	Akukho mntu uze kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He works for both of us.	Usebenza kuthi sobabini.
I know where everyone lives.	Ndiyazi apho kuhlala wonke umntu.
But there it is again.	Kodwa nantso kwakhona.
This is what we know for sure.	Yile nto siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
They sit down on the side.	Bahlala phantsi ecaleni.
That does everything.	Oko kwenza yonke into.
We will eat together.	Siza kutya kunye.
I think it will be good.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
It seems clear to us that there is.	Kubonakala kucacile kuthi ukuba kukho.
But he would do what he could.	Kodwa wayeza kwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
We had to leave quickly.	Kwafuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
He wanted an answer.	Wayefuna impendulo.
You eat breakfast every day.	Utya isidlo sakusasa yonke imihla.
Not so in this case though.	Akunjalo kule meko nangona kunjalo.
I'm glad to be staying.	Ndiyavuya ukuhlala.
I could not speak.	Andikwazanga ukuthetha.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ke wayecinga.
You will probably succeed.	Mhlawumbi uya kuphumelela.
You have a problem now!	Unengxaki ngoku!
Very good response.	Impendulo entle kakhulu.
Really? 	Ngokwenene?
At first he agreed, but soon he became angry.	Ekuqaleni wavuma, kodwa kungekudala waba nomsindo.
This can be really painful.	Oku kunokuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
Everyone else.	Bonke abanye.
But only for him.	Kodwa kuphela kuye.
He wondered then.	Wazibuza ngoko.
Or maybe not for you.	Okanye mhlawumbi hayi kuwe.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
He only looked back.	Wajonga ngasemva kuphela.
And he never had it.	Kwaye akazange abe nayo.
See what's going on.	Jonga ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
All of this takes time.	Konke oku kuthatha ixesha.
There is something wonderful to know.	Kukho into entle ukwazi.
I have always thought what it would be like.	Ndiye ndacinga rhoqo ukuba kuya kuba njani.
I'm really scared.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene.
We did it together.	Senze kunye.
But maybe so.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kunjalo.
He did not stay long then.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide ngoko.
Although you know better.	Nangona ukwazi ngcono.
He talks about everything.	Uthetha ngayo yonke into.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto.
There was not much in it.	Kwakungekho nto ingako kuyo.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nto .
Do not try to eat.	Musa ukuzama ukutya.
I think you're wasting your time.	Ndicinga ukuba udlala ngexesha lakho.
But it will be good.	Kodwa kuya kuba kuhle.
I want to say something.	Ndifuna ukuthetha into.
I mean what do you think you are thinking.	Ndithetha ukuba ucinga ukuba ucinga ntoni.
This seems to us.	Oku kubonakala ngathi.
He left early this morning.	Uhambe kwangoko ngale ntsasa.
I go to him.	Ndiya kuye.
It takes work.	Kuthatha umsebenzi.
To play .	Ukudlala .
You should know for sure.	Umele ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
Yes it is.	Ewe ilungile.
I have been trying to find a new job for a long time.	Kudala ndizama ukufumana umsebenzi omtsha.
In this he was not alone.	Kule nto wayengekho yedwa.
He would be a doctor, a good job.	Wayeza kuba ngugqirha, umsebenzi olungileyo.
And look at this place.	Kwaye jonga kule ndawo.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Ngoku akafuni kwaphela ukudlala.
It is impossible to do that.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza oko.
Do not overreact.	Musa ukuba nomsindo kakhulu.
He did not sit down.	Akazange ahlale phantsi.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Thanks, but you don't have to be there.	Enkosi, kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba ube lapho.
Tell your mother where you are going.	Xelela umama wakho apho uya khona.
He should not have said anything.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba athethe nto.
See what happened.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
And nobody did anything about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza nantoni na ngaloo nto.
This can be good for him.	Oku kunokuba kuhle kuye.
It's really nice to see.	Kuhle ngokwenene ukubona.
The case for being there.	Ityala lokuba lapho.
Please tell me.	Nceda undixelele.
That would be difficult.	Oko bekuya kuba nzima.
We did both.	Senze sobabini.
I may have done the right thing.	Inokuba ndenze into elungileyo.
And yet, no one wanted to know.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi.
There it is again, yes.	Nantso kwakhona, ewe.
She does not like to travel.	Akakuthandi ukuhamba.
And not just books.	Kwaye hayi iincwadi kuphela.
Now what did I do ?.	Ngoku ndenze ntoni?.
I could not go to him.	Khange ndikwazi ukuya kuye.
That's all now.	Yinto yonke ngoku.
That's all.	Yiloo nto yonke.
And look at him.	Kwaye jonga kuye.
But we did nothing.	Kodwa asizange senze nto.
You’re lucky, though.	Unethamsanqa, nangona kunjalo.
You’ve gone through all of this.	Uhambe kuyo yonke le ngxaki.
He walked away.	Wahamba wahamba.
It's hard to do everything.	Kunzima ukwenza yonke into.
I can't achieve this.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela oku.
He asked what the problem was.	Wabuza ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
New every day.	Entsha yonke imihla.
Only permission is required.	Kufuneka imvume kuphela.
But there is no problem with that.	Kodwa akukho ngxaki kuloo nto.
Anyway, you know.	Nangona kunjalo, uyazi.
Incredibly tall.	Mde ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
The job should only do one thing.	Umsebenzi kufuneka wenze into enye kuphela.
He did not enter the house.	Akazange angene endlini.
It will be back tomorrow.	Iza kubuya ngomso.
Please! 	Nceda!
Yeah, not me.	Ewe, hayi mna.
Long before you.	Kudala phambi kwakho.
He came out immediately.	Waphuma kwangoko.
He arrived home late.	Wafika ekhaya emva kwexesha.
Whatever his name is.	Nokuba ngubani igama lakhe.
And you are the only one.	Kwaye nguwe kuphela.
I know it's true.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinyani.
Everyone now agreed.	Wonke umntu ngoku wavuma.
It's not just me.	Ayindim nje.
When we have to do it.	Xa kufuneka senze njalo.
Not since lunch yesterday.	Hayi ukusukela ngesidlo sasemini izolo.
But, you will have to do very well.	Kodwa, kuya kufuneka ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
I don't care though.	Andikhathali kodwa.
It's hard to tell unless you're there.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngaphandle kokuba ukhona.
I'm not sure what they will be.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba baya kuba yintoni.
Do you want to go to town?	Uyafuna ukuya edolophini?
Clearly, something happened.	Kucacile ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
I do not know what the problem is here.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki apha.
But he thought better of it.	Kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
After you.	Emva kwakho.
Well, we know how that happened.	Kulungile, siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
You know, it's just a big deal.	Uyazi, yinto nje enkulu.
No, not at all, no.	Hayi, akunjalo, hayi.
And there is the fact that he did not appear this morning.	Kwaye kukho into yokuba khange abonakale ngale ntsasa.
There was not much to do.	Kwakungekho nto ingako yokwenza.
Well, what's new there.	Kulungile, yintoni entsha apho.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu kunjalo.
You said you were sure.	Ubuthe uqinisekile.
It's just me here.	Kum nje apha.
I can't wait tonight.	Andikwazi kulinda namhlanje ebusuku.
But it is a good thing.	Kodwa yinto entle.
Thanks again for all your help.	Enkosi kwakhona ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
And there is a gift.	Kwaye kukho isipho.
That's good for me.	Oko kulungile ngam.
There is no place for him here.	Akukho ndawo yakhe apha.
What do you think of this book?	Ucinga ntoni ngale ncwadi?
But not others.	Kodwa hayi abanye.
For it will certainly happen.	Kuba ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka.
If you do not want to do that.	Ukuba awufuni ukwenza oko.
Not in one place.	Akunjalo kwindawo enye.
Where did you go?	Uye phi?
Why is that? 	Kutheni kunjalo?
He will be here with us.	Uya kuba apha kunye nathi.
Or still in it.	Okanye nangoku kuyo.
Tell me something else.	Ndixelele enye into.
And maybe they will.	Kwaye mhlawumbi baya kwenza njalo.
And a week later.	Kwaye iveki emva koko.
This can happen at any time.	Oku kunokwenzeka nanini na.
It will seem so.	Kuya kubonakala kunjalo.
There is no danger there.	Akukho ngozi apho.
I know again.	Ndiyazi kwakhona.
You have to do this every day.	Kufuneka wenze oku yonke imihla.
He thought it was okay.	Wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
I will not say.	Andiyi kuthetha.
They will stay for many weeks like that.	Baza kuhlala iiveki ezininzi ngolo hlobo.
I don't know what's wrong.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
Maybe one day he would try that.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini wayeza kuzama oko.
Not too high, not too low.	Hayi phezulu kakhulu, hayi phantsi kakhulu.
I thought it was something like that.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto enje.
See what's happening here.	Jonga kwenzeka ntoni apha.
No one really knows what to do.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene into amakayenze.
i can do it.	ndingayenza.
He is often angry.	Udla ngokuba nomsindo.
He has finally left.	Ekugqibeleni uye wahamba.
But not this.	Kodwa hayi oku.
They will walk down.	Baza kuhamba phantsi.
It seems like a big deal to me.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu kum.
I can't do it myself though.	Andikwazi kuyenza ngokwam kodwa.
Your location.	Indawo yakho.
I didn't see much.	Khange ndibone nto ingako.
I knew something was wrong.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
That means there is.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kukho.
No problem, of course.	Akukho ngxaki, kunjalo.
They live together.	Bahlala kunye.
For convenience.	Ukuze kube lula.
Without him.	Ngaphandle kwakhe.
It's hard to know.	Kunzima ukwazi.
He did not need to know.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba azi.
But, again, it probably isn't.	Kodwa, kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
How he knew he didn't know.	Ukuba wayesazi njani ukuba wayengazi.
Of course.	Kunjalo.
It's not like you're saying anything about it.	Akukho ngathi uthetha nantoni na ngayo.
No, not you.	Hayi, hayi wena.
He suggested that he was well aware that this would happen.	Wacebisa ukuba uyazi kakuhle ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
But he did not tell anyone why.	Kodwa akazange axelele mntu ukuba kutheni.
I completely forgot.	Ndilibele tu.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ngoku.
And he did so.	Wenze njalo ke.
Yes, right here in our house.	Ewe, apha endlini yethu.
Saying nothing about me.	Ukuthetha nto ngam.
The question is when.	Umbuzo kukuba nini.
At home.	Ekhaya.
This will take a very long time.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
He was not the one he wanted to be.	Yayingenguye lo wayefuna ukuba nguye.
I know what you will do.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kwenza ntoni na.
After all, it probably had to be hard.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi bekufanele kube nzima.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
But we did not do that.	Kodwa asizange senze njalo.
You know, like me.	Uyazi, njengam.
He sits there every day.	Uhleli apho yonke imihla.
Nothing happened.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo.
So you have to be realistic about that.	Ngoko kufuneka ube yinyani ngaloo nto.
Then he learned to see.	Emva koko wafunda ukubona.
He didn't, really.	Naye akazange, ngokwenene.
So, what time is it?	Ngoko ke, yintoni ixesha?
Someone else did that.	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto.
‘How to come’.	'Iza njani'.
I want a very small dog.	Ndifuna inja encinci kakhulu.
That we had to go.	Oko kwafuneka sihambe.
I sat up in bed.	Ndihlale ebhedini.
So everyone needs a new place to live.	Ngoko wonke umntu ufuna indawo entsha yokuhlala naye.
He plays tennis well.	Udlala intenetya kakuhle.
I do not need your help.	Andifuni uncedo lwakho.
They went to each other.	Baye omnye komnye.
I don't understand why though.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni nangona kunjalo.
And that would be fine.	Kwaye oko kunokuba kulungile.
They are all there!	Bakho bonke!
We need to do a better job at it.	Kufuneka senze umsebenzi ongcono ngayo.
Something very unusual happened.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo.
I don't know which one.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi na.
Please go now.	Nceda uhambe, ngoku.
There are a lot of people.	Kukho abantu abaninzi.
I can't wait to see what he comes up with this week.	Andikwazi kulinda ukubona ukuba uza ngantoni kule veki.
After that, marriage.	Emva koko, umtshato.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
There are times there.	Kukho amaxesha apho.
I'm starting from this place.	Ndiyaqala kule ndawo.
Few days.	Iintsuku ezimbalwa.
This is what we know now, everyone.	Yile nto siyazi ngoku, wonke umntu.
One job at a time.	Umsebenzi omnye ngexesha.
You must be right.	Ufanele ukuba ulungile.
I apologize for her.	Ndicela uxolo ngaye.
Or maybe there is.	Okanye mhlawumbi kukho.
All that is better.	Konke oko kungcono.
He thought it was good, too.	Wayecinga ukuba kuhle, naye.
He may have become angry.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba waba nomsindo.
But this time, that would be difficult.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, oko kuya kuba nzima.
I know, because that happened to me.	Ndiyazi, kuba oko kwenzeka kum.
We will be far away from you.	Siya kuba kude kuwe.
Good voice.	Ilizwi elihle.
He will not be.	Akayi kuba.
You do not know about this item.	Awukwazi ngale nto.
It takes a lot.	Kuthatha okuninzi.
Yes man.	Ewe umntu.
Because we need someone.	Kuba kufuneka umntu.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
He is wearing his shirt.	Unxibe ihempe yakhe.
First.	Ekuqaleni.
I just need to know what it is.	Kufuneka nje ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
I'll do it for you.	Ndiza kukwenza kuwe.
So we have to go.	Ngoko kufuneka sihambe.
Not just for me, though.	Hayi nje kum, nangona.
He wondered about that.	Wazibuza ngaloo nto.
Why do you think this happened?	Ucinga ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oku?
Is a doctor.	Ngaba ugqirha.
I really didn’t know what it could be.	Ngokwenene ndandingazi ukuba inokuba yintoni na.
But now he has done nothing.	Kodwa ngoku akazange enze nto.
I want you now.	Ndifuna wena ngoku.
Only today, though.	Kuphela namhlanje, nangona.
He always arrives late for class.	Usoloko efika emva kwexesha eklasini.
How hard it is to say this to someone else.	Kunzima kangakanani ukuthetha oku komnye umntu.
So, you can't win!	Ngoko, awukwazi ukuphumelela!
But he can't control himself.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuzibamba.
I knew you had a problem.	Ndandisazi ukuba unengxaki.
He never did anything like that.	Akazange enze nto ngaloo ndlela.
See you soon!	Ndiza kubona kungekudala!
We want to know what happened.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
But then he heard something.	Kodwa emva koko weva into.
He ran away.	Wabaleka wabaleka.
We've done that before.	Senze loo nto ngaphambili.
No, no, it is not possible.	Hayi, hayi, akunakwenzeka.
You too .	Nawe .
Because there is none.	Ngenxa yokuba akukho.
I thought there was something 'wrong' with me.	Ndacinga ukuba kukho into 'engalunganga' ngam.
You are scared.	Uyoyika .
And you should, too.	Kwaye ufanele ukuba, nawe.
I want to talk about you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngawe.
The police will not come here.	Amapolisa akayi kuza apha.
Everything old, now.	Yonke into endala, ngoku.
Are you okay.	Ngaba ulungile.
Or better yet.	Okanye kungcono.
If you do, don't wait too long.	Ukuba wenza njalo, musa ukulinda kakhulu.
Do you have a dog?	Unayo inja?
And also.	Kwaye kwakhona.
That seemed like us.	Oko kwakubonakala ngathi.
He certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange enze njalo.
And now he has.	Kwaye ngoku uyenzile.
You can do it now.	Ungayenza ngoku.
And to be comfortable.	Kwaye ukuhlala kakuhle.
I will be there too.	Ndiya kuba khona kwaye.
I'm tired of doing it this way.	Ndidiniwe kukwenza ngolu hlobo.
He ate dinner.	Watya isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Staying there is not.	Ukuhlala kukho akukho.
I have to go to work.	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini.
I did it myself.	Ndenze ngokwam.
Really, really bad.	Ngokwenene, kakubi ngokwenene.
You want a better book.	Ufuna incwadi engcono.
Then the problem.	Emva koko ingxaki.
I still am.	Ngaba nangoku.
Looking for more?	Ngaba ufuna ezinye?
Me or some of your friends.	Mna okanye abanye abahlobo bakho.
See how you feel.	Jonga ukuba uziva njani.
He nodded in agreement.	Wavuma wavuma.
To me, you have everything.	Kum, unayo yonke into.
Yes, there you are.	Ewe, kukho wena.
He made up his mind, then.	Wenza ingqondo, emva koko.
It's absolutely fine.	Ilungile ngokupheleleyo.
Then he looked around the room.	Emva koko wajonga egumbini.
I didn't know that.	Bendingayazi loo nto.
Moving forward.	Ukuhamba phambili.
Not hers or her son.	Hayi yakhe okanye unyana wakhe.
We really want to do this.	Sifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza le nto.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
But he did not do it regularly.	Kodwa akazange ayenze rhoqo.
He told her but it was okay.	Wamxelela kodwa kulungile.
I will wait until then.	Ndiza kulinda kude kube ngoko.
He could not move forward.	Akazange akwazi ukuya phambili.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Akayazi into eyenzekayo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kangako.
I know, but the question is why.	Ndiyazi, kodwa umbuzo kukuba kutheni.
Great place.	Indawo enkulu.
But he has to have time.	Kodwa kufuneka abe nexesha.
He did not want her to know.	Wayengafuni ukuba azi.
They say no problem.	Bathi akukho ngxaki.
It's so long.	Lixesha elide kangaka.
In practice, perhaps.	Ngokwenza, mhlawumbi.
I felt so good.	Ndive ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
In time he became a man.	Emva kwexesha waba yindoda.
I would like to win.	Ndingathanda ukuphumelela.
He told me exactly how he was going to do it.	Undixelele kanye ukuba uya kwenza njani.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andazi ncam ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
There is a lot of truth in it.	Kukho inyaniso eninzi kuyo.
It's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene.
We just want to stay here at night.	Sifuna nje ukuhlala apha ebusuku.
But that can be very far away.	Kodwa oko kunokuba kude kakhulu.
But we will see what happens.	Kodwa siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He wondered how far he would go.	Wayecinga ukuba uya kude kangakanani na.
That's the way he did, that's right.	Nantso indlela aqhube ngayo, kunjalo.
And they did not.	Kwaye abazange.
And there are a lot of things about that.	Kwaye kukho izinto ezininzi malunga naloo nto.
It will be fun.	Uya kuba mnandi.
He looked at nothing.	Wajonga kwanto.
This means now.	Oku kuthetha ngoku.
It has not been for years.	Akuzange kube iminyaka.
So he fled in haste.	Ngoko wabaleka ngokukhawuleza.
Yes, money.	Ewe, imali.
That would be a big deal.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu.
But he thought nothing of it.	Kodwa akazange acinge nto.
And this is good.	Kwaye oku kulungile.
This, however, is not the case.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
He felt like he could not go.	Waziva ngathi akanakukwazi ukuya.
Something terrible happened.	Kwenzeke into embi.
I don't want to go there.	Andifuni ukuya apho.
Playing by being a man again.	Ukudlala ngokuba yindoda kwakhona.
Staying at home for dinner.	Ukuhlala ekhaya ukufumana isidlo.
I mean this.	Ndithetha oku.
It will be easier to stop.	Kuya kuba lula ukuyeka.
He immediately felt a little better.	Kwangoko waziva engcono kancinci.
Some say he did not do enough.	Abanye bathi akenzanga ngokwaneleyo.
He spent the rest of his life there.	Wachitha bonke ubomi bakhe apho.
I need his help.	Ndifuna uncedo lwakhe.
But don't stay long, now.	Kodwa musa ukuhlala ixesha elide, ngoku.
But he refused.	Kodwa akazange avume.
Then next to me.	Emva koko ecaleni kwam.
There is no one in the classroom.	Akukho mntu eklasini.
Mary entered.	Wangena uMarry.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha nayo.
Only if you want to.	Kuphela ukuba ufuna kunjalo.
He sat down and looked.	Wahlala phantsi wajonga.
Please do it.	Nceda uyenze.
You just told me.	Undixelele nje.
I'm really tired today.	Ndidiniwe nyani namhlanje.
He went down and ate by himself.	Wehla watya yedwa.
But !!!.	Kodwa !!!.
He spent many years in prison.	Wachitha iminyaka yakhe emininzi entolongweni.
You can have him.	Usenokuba naye.
He thought for sure.	Wacinga ngokuqinisekileyo.
I do it very well.	Ndiyenza kakuhle kakhulu.
At home, at school.	Ekhaya, esikolweni.
I don't want to be there.	Andifuni ukuba lapho.
But you wait two weeks.	Kodwa ulinde iiveki ezimbini.
But you are clearly a good person too.	Kodwa kucacile ukuba ungumntu omhle nawe.
But he was not at home for long.	Kodwa wayengekho ixesha elide ekhaya.
He can be with you.	Unokuba nawe.
He would be with her.	Wayeza kuba naye.
He lives there all his life.	Uhlala apho ubomi bakhe bonke.
Not that you know much about it.	Hayi ukuba uyazi kakhulu ngayo.
Life, so nothing.	Ubomi, ngoko akukho nto.
I will definitely do that more soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza ngakumbi loo nto kungekudala.
This is the same thing.	Le yinto enye kanye.
He sat down and read his book.	Wahlala phantsi wafunda incwadi yakhe.
He wanted to know why.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Just a little bit, but okay.	Kancinci nje, kodwa kulungile.
I never heard of him.	Zange ndive ngaye.
There was no need for him to try.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba azame.
There is something I need to do.	Kukho into ekufuneka ndiyenzile.
It was never about me.	Akuzange kube malunga nam.
Good here.	Kuhle apha.
I can't believe you did this to me.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenzile le nto kum.
That he certainly did not do.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akazange akwenze.
He has to go to work every day.	Kufuneka aye emsebenzini yonke imihla.
I have never done that before.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
He has done it before.	Uye wakwenza ngaphambili.
Marriage is a thing.	Umtshato yinto.
I know, but.	Ndiyazi, kodwa .
You have been there for a long time.	Unexesha elide ukhona.
If you go to class, you learn something.	Ukuba uya eklasini, ufunda into.
He said he did not want to come back.	Wathi akafuni kubuya.
We had to do it again.	Kwafuneka siyenze kwakhona.
I'm sure it is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo.
He looked at the book.	Wajonga incwadi.
I did not tell anyone.	khange ndixelele mntu.
Do not drive too fast.	Musa ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza.
You do not know for sure.	Awuyazi ngokuqinisekileyo loo nto.
Now he wants money.	Ngoku ufuna imali.
Why, he didn't know.	Kutheni, wayengazi.
Then he could not control himself.	Emva koko akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
He also drowned.	Naye wazama.
We want your feedback.	Sifuna impendulo yakho.
You may have it.	Usenokuba unayo.
Here it is again.	Nantso ke kwakhona.
It takes so long to make one.	Kuthatha ixesha elide kangaka ukwenza enye.
Although there are days.	Nangona kukho iintsuku.
You better go.	Kungcono uhambe.
It certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuba njalo.
Let that be.	Makhe ukuba.
But I could not.	Kodwa andikwazanga.
Is it me? 	Ngaba ndim?
Then travel will be easier.	Emva koko ukuhamba kuya kuba lula.
It will be a long time.	Kuya kuba lixesha elide.
Not just death, but something else.	Hayi nje ukufa, kodwa enye into.
That's the answer to it.	Nantso ke impendulo kuyo.
He has become.	Uye waba .
This will happen to us.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kuthi.
He really meant it.	Wayethetha ngokwenene.
Big dog.	Inja enkulu.
Just for one thing.	Ngento enye nje.
It will go.	Iza kuhamba.
All right, by the way.	Kulungile, ngendlela.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza loo nto.
That's more.	Yiloo nto ngakumbi.
Everyone needs help.	Wonke umntu ufuna uncedo.
Then he tried the door.	Emva koko wazama ucango.
There, now you know.	Apho, ngoku uyazi.
I told her then.	Ndamxelela ke ngelo xesha.
He made a good time.	Wenza ixesha elihle.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
He will have to do so.	Kuya kufuneka enze njalo.
Thank you !.	Enkosi !.
You can do it again.	Ungayenza kwakhona.
But something else is happening here.	Kodwa kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
He said he never did.	Wathi akazange ayenze.
He does too.	Naye uyayenza.
There is something here.	Kukho into apha.
Or it should not be.	Okanye akufanele kube njalo.
I want it to be true.	Ndifuna ukuba yinyani.
Yes, you learn something new every day.	Ewe, ufunda into entsha yonke imihla.
He is very serious about it.	Uzimisele kakhulu ngayo.
New car.	Imoto entsha.
He had to stay in prison.	Kwafuneka ahlale entolongweni.
If you do not want to, then we will find another way.	Ukuba awufuni ngoko siya kufumana enye indlela.
But they will say so.	Kodwa baya kuthetha ukuba kunjalo.
Everyone says this.	Wonke umntu uthetha oku.
You may or may not do it.	Ungayenza okanye awukwazi.
I wanted something else.	Ndandifuna enye into.
Well, this is just for you.	Ewe, le yinto nje kuwe.
If you think you can do it, you will do it.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba ungayenza, uya kuyenza.
It will take time for that.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha ukuba.
He went to work.	Waya emsebenzini.
We'll be more on that later.	Siza kuba ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
Let me tell you something about myself.	Makhe ndikuxelele into ngam.
He began to think again.	Waqalisa ukucinga kwakhona.
Everyone who took the test passed.	Wonke umntu owenze uvavanyo uphumelele.
All week.	Iveki yonke.
You have to do some.	Kufuneka wenze ezinye.
He became even more difficult.	Waba nzima ngakumbi.
Not so much.	Hayi okuninzi.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
Same thing every day.	Into enye yonke imihla.
He slept all night.	Walala ubusuku bonke.
However in this case.	Nangona kunjalo kule meko.
He should not be alone.	Akufunekanga ahlale yedwa.
There he knew where he was.	Apho wayesazi ukuba uphi.
Well, not at first.	Ewe, hayi ekuqaleni.
If it is too good to be true, it probably is.	Ukuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani, kunokwenzeka ukuba kunjalo.
But we need to do this.	Kodwa kufuneka siyenze le nto.
Everything seems too old.	Konke kubonakala kudala kakhulu.
But you did not.	Kodwa awuzange.
This is his truth.	Le yinyani yakhe.
Don't think too much of it.	Musa ukucinga kakhulu ngayo.
Here, last night, in my bedroom.	Apha, phezolo, kwigumbi lam lokulala.
Your job is to make it easier.	Umsebenzi wakho kukwenza oko kube lula.
Yes, almost everyone.	Ewe, phantse wonke umntu.
It is all or nothing.	Yiyo yonke okanye akukho nto.
Well, maybe now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ngoku.
You have to think hard.	Kufuneka ucinge kakhulu.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Kungcono ndihlale ekhaya kunokuba ndihambe.
I just wanted him to know he knew.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba azi ukuba uyazi.
You know that well.	Uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
To do this, we need people.	Ukuze senze oku, sifuna abantu.
Yeah, not up.	Ewe, hayi phezulu.
Playing is work.	Ukudlala ngumsebenzi.
I mean, good.	Ndithetha, elungileyo.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto, akukho nto.
Just, really immediately.	Nje, ngenene kwangoko.
You have to look at people.	Kufuneka ujonge abantu.
One and done.	Enye kwaye yenziwe.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
I did not know where he was.	Bendingazi noba uphi.
Do not eat meat regularly.	Musa ukutya inyama rhoqo.
His mother, too.	Umama wakhe, naye.
Sorry, but that's just the way it is.	Uxolo, kodwa kunjalo nje.
Yeah, that's good enough.	Ewe, kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
That means we will need help.	Oko kuthetha ukuba siya kufuna uncedo.
I have been doing this for a long time.	Kudala ndiyenza le nto.
He agreed to attend.	Wavuma ukuba khona.
After all, it is not.	Emva koko, akunjalo.
Where did he go?	Waya phi?
Otherwise, there really is nothing.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho nto ngokwenene.
He just wanted to play with her.	Wayefuna nje ukudlala naye.
I think he is, a little bit.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye, kancinci.
I have to be with you.	Kufuneka ndibe nawe.
It's really good, of course.	Ilungile ngokwenene, kunjalo.
I love it, and thank you !!!!.	Ndiyayithanda, kwaye enkosi !!!!.
It would be difficult.	Bekuya kuba nzima.
You need to know that.	Kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
I will buy it myself.	Ndiya kuthenga ndedwa.
His story.	Ibali lakhe.
He likes a lot of things.	Uthanda izinto ezininzi.
She says her son is better now.	Uthi unyana wakhe ungcono ngoku.
Not like anything else out there.	Akunjalo nantoni na enye ngaphandle.
Not a bit anymore.	Hayi kancinci kwakhona.
I think that's a bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi leyo.
I wonder who we are.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani kuthi.
For it is now done.	Kuba yenziwe ngoku.
Let me think about that.	Makhe ndicinge ngaloo nto.
It's hard to make friends.	Kunzima ukwenza abahlobo.
Otherwise, you will want to.	Ngaphandle koko, uya kufuna.
You will find two in this book.	Uya kufumana ezimbini kule ncwadi.
You have to learn.	Ufanele ukufunda.
He will do it again.	Uya kuphinda.
And be with you.	Kwaye ube nawe.
There is a problem.	Kukho ingxaki.
You think you will do one and you will do another.	Ucinga ukuba uya kwenza enye kwaye uya kwenza enye.
You should know that too.	Ufanele ukwazi oko nawe.
I have not been able to do anything right now.	Andikwazanga kwenza nto okwangoku.
It's really hard.	Kunzima ngokwenene.
He wants to have lunch with you.	Ufuna ukutya nawe isidlo sasemini.
I will definitely try this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiza kuzama oku.
I don't want you to think a bit about me.	Andifuni ukuba ucinge kancinci ngam.
You know, I really am.	Uyazi, mna ngenene.
They will have it anyway.	Baza kuba nayo nangona kunjalo.
You certainly know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi.
I don't know what that might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba yintoni na loo nto.
You're going to be a doctor.	Uzakuba ngugqirha.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
It's a tiny little thing.	Yinto encinci encinci.
He tried to say something.	Wazama ukuthetha into.
I can't think it's over.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba phezulu.
You will succeed.	Uya kuphumelela.
She realized that her father loved her.	Waqonda ukuba utata wakhe uyamthanda.
Not if you don't want to.	Hayi ukuba awufuni.
Almost as much, of course.	Phantse kangangoko, kunjalo.
Sitting for too long now.	Ukuhlala phantsi ixesha elide kakhulu ngoku.
He tried to figure out where he was.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba uphi na.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
You do not have to be a friend.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube ngumhlobo.
For many people it is difficult.	Abantu abaninzi kunzima.
To say what I want to say.	Ukuthetha into endifuna ukuyithetha.
He can't do it without her.	Akakwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe.
One down, one to go.	Omnye phantsi, omnye ukuya.
I'm not there now.	Andikho apho ngoku.
Until then, all the time.	Kude kube ngoko, ngalo lonke ixesha.
You didn't even have to succeed.	Kwakungeyomfuneko nokuba uphumelele.
Let it be easy.	Akhe kube lula.
I have to tell you again.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele kwakhona.
But if he did not.	Kodwa ukuba akazange.
She also goes to school.	Naye uya esikolweni.
Or so, not so much.	Okanye kunjalo, hayi kakhulu.
Sitting in his car.	Ukuhlala emotweni yakhe.
He is confident that one day he will succeed.	Uqinisekile ukuba ngenye imini uya kuphumelela.
He told her so, always.	Wamxelela njalo, rhoqo.
Looks like no.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho.
And then there was nothing again.	Kwaye ke kwakungekho nto kwakhona.
It does not have to be this way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube ngolu hlobo ke.
I will not need a car.	Andiyi kufuna imoto.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni ngomso.
You have to go well.	Kufuneka uhambe kakuhle.
You made a mistake, you know!	Wenza impazamo, uyazi!
Well, not really, that's right.	Ewe, akunjalo, kunjalo.
And I did the same thing with the work.	Kwaye ndenze into efanayo ngomsebenzi.
My father entered the room.	Utata wangena egumbini.
I will not be late.	Andiyi kuba late.
No one wanted to know anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi nto.
Everyone was thinking the same thing.	Wonke umntu wayecinga into enye.
It’s everything to him.	Yinto yonke kuye.
You did a very good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
We know now.	Siyazi ngoku.
I don't think it's right.	Andiqondi ukuba ilungile.
I am waiting.	Ndilinde ke.
I need to go and get help.	Kufuneka ndiye kufuna uncedo.
Hopefully something will go wrong.	Unethemba lokuba kukho into eza kuhamba.
But this is no question.	Kodwa oku akukho mbuzo.
He does not need to say more.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba athethe ngakumbi.
I would say this, though.	Ndiya kuthetha oku, nangona kunjalo.
Why you should.	Kutheni ufanele.
It takes three days to die.	Kuthatha iintsuku ezintathu ukufa.
Really, there is.	Ngokwenene, kukho.
Doing the right thing.	Ukwenza into elungileyo.
I doubt he will return.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uya kubuya.
Not a dog, either.	Hayi inja, okanye.
But here comes more.	Kodwa apha kuza okuninzi.
Over again.	Kwakhona kwakhona.
He's just trying to help.	Uzama nje ukunceda.
See how good everyone is.	Jonga indlela entle ngayo wonke umntu.
And there is a dog.	Kwaye kukho inja.
A little bit really.	Kancinci ngokwenene.
I would like you to do that.	Ndingathanda ukuba wenze oko.
I'll be back some years, of course.	Ndiya kubuya iminyaka ethile, kunjalo.
I'm sure it will show.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba iya kubonakala.
This place is OK.	Le ndawo ilungile.
Or not about me.	Okanye hayi ngam.
Look at the children.	Jonga abantwana.
This goes in the right direction.	Oku kuhamba ngendlela elungileyo.
I have to do what it takes.	Kufuneka ndenze oko kuthatha.
How can I do that.	Ndingayenza njani lonto.
That's what it does.	Oko kukwenza.
And you know this.	Kwaye uyazi oku.
Yes, and yes and yes.	Ewe, kwaye ewe kwaye ewe.
He went in and lay down.	Wangena ke walala.
He will return later.	Uya kubuya kamva.
Now, everybody knows it.	Ngoku, wonke umntu uyayazi.
I did not know how.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani.
Music can be here today and go tomorrow.	Umculo unokuba lapha namhlanje kwaye uhambe ngomso.
There was no one living there.	Kwakungekho mntu uhlala apho.
Nice place here.	Indawo entle apha.
I think that's just fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle nje.
At that time, there was no one there	Ngelo xesha, kwakungekho mntu
A very good person.	Umntu olungileyo kakhulu.
I'm really sorry though.	Ndiyaxolisa nyani kodwa .
No one ever thought that this would happen.	Akukho mntu wakha wacinga ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
You want to do it again, you want another chance.	Ufuna ukuyenza kwakhona, ufuna elinye ithuba.
Or pretend he doesn't want to.	Okanye wenze ngathi akafuni.
Only you and the children.	Kuphela wena kunye nabantwana.
Another question.	Omnye umbuzo.
And we will.	Kwaye siya kwenza.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akukho ndawo.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukho enye indlela.
I would like to do more of that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza ngakumbi oko.
I would like to do the same thing.	Ndingathanda ukwenza into efanayo.
I can't wait to see that.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukubona oko.
And you have to do it.	Kwaye kufuneka uyenze.
I'll be late.	Ndiza kuba late.
He never had it.	Akazange abe nayo.
Then two things happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka izinto ezimbini.
He slept last night.	Ulele phezolo.
Have you ever.	Ngaba wakhe.
Only not so fast.	Kuphela hayi ngokukhawuleza.
And talk to him.	Kwaye uthethe naye.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki.
We never did that, of course.	Asizange siyenze loo nto, kunjalo.
Our only chance is to move forward.	Ithuba lethu kuphela kukuba phambili.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
Why, why, why.	Kutheni, kutheni, kutheni.
Not at all, of course.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo, kunjalo.
He certainly should not have come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo bekungafanelanga ukuba eze.
Nothing he has done seems right.	Akukho nto ayenzileyo ebonakala ilungile.
I hope you went well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhambe kakuhle.
That is not the case with me.	Ayisiyiyo loo nto kum.
No, not yet.	Hayi, hayi okwangoku.
My mother told me that.	Umama undixelele lonto.
Even if you are.	Nokuba ukhona.
Apparently not much.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho kakhulu.
And every night.	Kwaye njalo ebusuku.
He wanted his wife.	Wayefuna umfazi wakhe.
This way, please.	Ngale ndlela, nceda.
You have to go to work.	Kufuneka uye emsebenzini.
We went to everything.	Siye kuyo yonke into.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu uqhuba kakuhle.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
He lived inside.	Wayehlala ngaphakathi.
Or, in this case, you to me.	Okanye, kule meko, wena kum.
I don't want it to happen to you.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke kuwe.
And then mom.	Kwaye emva koko umama.
How he lives within you.	Uhlala njani ngaphakathi kuwe.
But no, not before.	Kodwa hayi, hayi ngaphambili.
He doesn't want you to know that.	Akafuni ukuba uyazi loo nto.
Not every day, of course.	Hayi yonke imihla, kunjalo.
That's just the first one.	Lowo ngowokuqala kuphela.
Just as he knew they would be.	Kanye njengoko wayesazi ukuba baya kuba njalo.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo konke konke.
You spend less.	Uchitha kancinci.
Time, that's the problem.	Ixesha, nantso ingxaki.
To meet him at a party.	Ukudibana naye epatini.
Therefore, he did nothing.	Ngoko ke, akenzanga nto.
So he ran away.	Ngoko wabaleka wemka.
He did not want to die.	Wayengafuni ukufa.
What could this problem be?	Inokuba yintoni le ngxaki.
Where did they go? 	Baye phi?
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
He apologized for that.	Wacela uxolo ngaloo nto.
No one is willing to speak out.	Akukho mntu uzimisele ukuthetha phandle.
Look at his performance.	Jonga ukusebenza kwakhe.
And there is no future, only time.	Kwaye akukho xesha elizayo, kukho ixesha kuphela.
I am the life.	Ndim ubomi.
It's not a big car.	Ayisiyiyo imoto enkulu.
And this is probably why it is so difficult.	Kwaye oku mhlawumbi kutheni kunzima kangaka.
Eating regularly and for a long time.	Ukutya rhoqo kunye nexesha elide.
So, we'll see.	Ngoko, siza kubona.
However, it is possible.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokwenzeka.
Why, at home you are a good person, too.	Kutheni, ekhaya ungumntu olungileyo, nawe.
I saw a picture.	Ndabona umfanekiso.
I'm here now.	Ndilapha ngoku.
Then he thought.	Emva koko wacinga.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
More to him a little bit.	Ngakumbi kuye kancinci.
And they will continue.	Kwaye baya kuqhubeka.
Maybe he would be better.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuba ngcono.
He really wanted to go.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
I wonder if.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba.
He could not get to her there well.	Akazange akwazi ukuya kuye apho kakuhle.
I wanted a wife.	Ndandifuna umfazi.
I really want this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene oku.
You know, you look tired.	Uyazi, ukhangeleka udiniwe.
I don't have to make a new one.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndenze entsha.
I'm sure you do too.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
This is really happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene .
Every day he did.	Yonke imihla ayenzileyo.
But no one is here.	Kodwa akukho mntu apha.
He went down the road.	Wehla ngendlela.
Is this person ?.	Ngaba lo mntu?.
I never thought it was right.	Khange ndicinge ukuba ilungile.
I went well all day today.	Ndihambe kakuhle imini yonke namhlanje.
Or, if he did, he did nothing about it.	Okanye, ukuba uyenzile, akenzanga nto ngaloo nto.
Can anyone please help.	Ngaba nabani na ndicela uncedo.
That must be difficult.	Oko kumele ukuba kunzima.
He slept until he finished his homework.	Walala de wagqiba umsebenzi wakhe wesikolo.
Music is good.	Umculo ulungile.
Thanks for now.	Enkosi okwangoku.
I was hoping this would mean something to me.	Bendinethemba lokuba oku kuya kuthetha kum.
I don't think he loves her either.	Andiqondi ukuba naye uyamthanda.
He doesn't have to say anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba athethe nto.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Akukho xesha lokwenza nantoni na ngaloo nto.
I need your help here.	Ndifuna uncedo lwakho apha.
Did you go to a party last week?	Ngaba uye epatini kwiveki ephelileyo?
So maybe that's what happened.	Ngoko mhlawumbi yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
I always do.	Ndihlala njalo.
There is no one else.	Akakho omnye.
Only this time it was not.	Kuphela ngeli xesha kwakungekho.
But, we did not do that.	Kodwa, asizange senze njalo.
I ask someone to help her.	Ndicela umntu amncede.
I just want more time.	Ndifuna nje ixesha elingakumbi.
It seemed like there was.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kukho.
Finally, Dad spoke up.	Ekugqibeleni, utata wathetha.
I know you love her.	Ndiyayazi uyamthanda .
Everyone here is good and kind.	Wonke umntu apha ulungile kwaye ulungile.
He would find a way.	Wayeza kufumana indlela.
Since then, that has not happened.	Ukusukela ngoko, akuzange kube njalo.
But if there is such a thing, then that's it.	Kodwa ukuba kukho into enjalo, yiloo nto ke.
I just didn't want to do my homework.	Ndandingafuni nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo.
But, yes, I am.	Kodwa, ewe, ndim.
You spend most of your time thinking about it.	Uchitha ixesha lakho elininzi ucinga ngayo.
Although not the case.	Nangona akunjalo.
Probably nothing needs to be done at this time.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto kufuneka yenziwe ngeli xesha.
You have to do the same thing over and over again.	Kufuneka wenze into enye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I will never see it again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndibone.
It is very difficult for me to do.	Kunzima kakhulu kum ukuyenza.
It wasn't this.	Yayingenguye lo.
Don't tell other people again.	Musa ukuxelela abanye abantu kwakhona.
You love one, you love another.	Uthanda enye, uyayithanda enye.
He knew it wouldn't be so.	Wayesazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
But he asked anyway.	Kodwa wabuza kunjalo.
I think everyone is fine.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu ulungile.
No one has ever known for sure.	Akukho mntu wakha wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
It's true for me.	Yinyani kum.
Then there is time.	Emva koko kukho ixesha.
But he did not just talk.	Kodwa akazange athethe nje.
It takes up too much space.	Kuthatha indawo eninzi kakhulu.
Yeah, not really.	Ewe, hayi ncam.
He does not like you.	Akakuthandi.
Look like this.	Jonga ngolu hlobo.
It never happened.	Zange kube njalo.
What a small.	Yintoni encinci.
He went back.	Uye wabuyela emva.
You may have said or done anything.	Usenokuba wathetha okanye wenze nantoni na.
That is my job.	Ngumsebenzi wam lowo.
Not a good read.	Hayi ukufunda kakuhle.
And that's certainly a good thing.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo yinto entle leyo.
Tell me where I'm looking.	Ndixelele ukuba ndijonge phi.
Why was he so angry?	Kwakutheni ukuze abe nomsindo kangaka?
I see no other way.	Andiboni enye indlela.
More than you think you know.	Ngaphezu kokuba ucinga ukuba uyazi.
This is often fine.	Oku ixesha elininzi kulungile.
Not too much to see.	Akukho kakhulu ukubona.
This will seem very difficult.	Oku kuya kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
I need to know what's going on here.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
Then there is our answer.	Ke kukho impendulo yethu.
But then, no problem.	Kodwa emva koko, akukho ngxaki.
Not so much about.	Hayi kakhulu malunga.
This is just a new fact.	Le yinyani nje entsha.
My father or me.	Utata wam okanye mna.
I just have to learn from it.	Kufuneka nje ndifunde kuyo.
I will come there myself.	Ndiza kuza apho ngokwam.
Yes, next week.	Ewe, kwiveki ezayo.
I had no idea about that.	Ndandingazi ngaloo nto.
They will get better.	Baya kuba ngcono.
Not that he was going to get anything.	Akunjalo ukuba wayeza kufumana into.
Or, you know.	Okanye, uyazi.
No, not people.	Hayi, hayi abantu.
The marriage did not have children.	Umtshato awuzange ube nabantwana.
I think it will go well.	Ndicinga ukuba iza kuhamba kakuhle.
They sit down.	Bahlala phantsi.
Let me go.	Ulinde ndihambe.
That, of course.	Nto leyo, kunjalo.
It was never done.	Ayizange yenziwe.
You will not be alone.	Awuyi kuba wedwa.
I can’t stop thinking about him.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngaye.
Then I thought about it.	Ndiye ndacinga ngayo.
He will not be in pain for long.	Akayi kuba buhlungu ixesha elide.
No, he thought.	Akunjalo, wacinga.
Surely one will see.	Ngokuqinisekileyo umntu uya kubona.
We know this is difficult.	Siyazi ukuba oku kunzima.
Everything should be fine.	Yonke into kufuneka ilungile.
He did and they said yes.	Uyenzile kwaye bathi ewe.
I don't know what he will do.	Andazi ukuba uya kwenza ntoni na.
He left this morning.	Uhambe ngale ntsasa.
You know what it is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
There is coffee too.	Kukho ikofu kwakhona.
That would be great fun.	Oko kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
He didn't want to play with me.	Wayengafuni ukudlala nam.
Everything else, you do well.	Yonke enye into, wenza kakuhle.
He told me where to go.	Undixelele ukuba ndiye phi.
We are not going anywhere immediately.	Asiyi ndawo ngokukhawuleza.
You need to think fast.	Kufuneka ucinge ngokukhawuleza.
It seems impossible for him to succeed.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukuba aphumelele.
There is one death.	Kukho ukufa omnye.
Do not try to make a decision.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza isigqibo.
But this is exactly it.	Kodwa oku kanye.
Because there is work.	Ngokuba umsebenzi ukhona.
I just want to help you.	Ndifuna nje ukukunceda.
She ran to him.	Wabaleka waya kuye.
Unless it is far from anything.	Ngaphandle kokuba kude nantoni na.
Please make your way forward.	Nceda wenze indlela yakho ukuya ngaphambili.
He said he would never be in such a beautiful place.	Wathi soze abe kwindawo entle kangaka.
Then I knew who she was.	Ndandisazi ke ukuba ngubani.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
But first he has to go inside.	Kodwa kuqala kufuneka angene ngaphakathi.
And now it's time to get busy.	Ke ngoku lixesha lokuba uxakekile.
Don't be hard on yourself!	Musa ukuba nzima kuwe!
He thought he was right.	Wayecinga ukuba ulungile.
There is a car in front.	Kukho imoto ngaphambili.
He was thinking of everything that was wrong.	Wayecinga ngayo yonke into engalunganga.
He wanted to stay there.	Wayefuna ukuhlala apho.
I don't know, of course.	Andazi, kunjalo.
And certainly others will.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo abanye baya kuyenza.
There was no way he could eat now.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokuba akwazi ukutya ngoku.
I wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza ngaloo nto .
But it is a long time.	Kodwa lixesha elide.
Yes, it can be difficult.	Ewe, kunokuba nzima.
This will be painful.	Oku kuya kuba buhlungu.
This will be good for him.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle kuye.
No, I will never do it again.	Hayi, soze ndiphinde.
Thank you for your excellent work.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi wakho omhle.
You have to say something about it.	Kufuneka uthethe nto ngayo.
I told him and he asked my name.	Ndamxelela wabuza igama lam.
It is one thing with money.	Yinto enye ngemali.
He has to do it perfectly.	Ufanele akwenze oko ngokupheleleyo.
Do not go to the office.	Musa ukuya eofisini.
The woman opened her eyes.	Wavula amehlo akhe umfazi.
Sorry about that.	Ngawe uxolo kakhulu.
You really have to go where the people are.	Ngenene kufuneka uye apho kukho abantu.
Now he asked this of her.	Ngoku wabuza oku kuye.
If you have.	Ukuba ukhe.
He thought that maybe he could do that.	Wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi angayenza loo nto.
And not far away.	Kwaye akukho kude.
Not that you have ever talked too much.	Akunjalo ukuba wakha wathetha kakhulu.
I did not tell anyone what was going on.	Khange ndixelele mntu ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I wanted to do it now.	Bendifuna ukuyenza ngoku.
And we will be back.	Kwaye siya kubuya.
I have to do something about it.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngayo.
Something that makes you think.	Into ekwenza ucinge.
And every day.	Kwaye yonke imihla.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
I didn't hear anything else.	Andizange ndive enye into.
Something that never happened.	Nto engazange yenzeke.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngokwenene.
I can't stay here.	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha.
How long will we stay.	Siya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
I think about him all the time.	Ndicinga ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha.
He went ahead.	Waya ngaphambili.
He made a place to stay.	Wenza indawo yokuhlala.
And so it is.	Kwaye kunjalo kunjalo.
He wanted to play.	Wayefuna ukudlala.
We did so.	Senze njalo ke.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazi.
And so he did.	Kwaye ke wakwazi.
I know exactly what happened.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into eyenzekayo.
It will be good for me.	Kuya kuba kuhle kum.
So, good job.	Ngoko, umsebenzi omhle.
I try every day.	Ndizama yonke imihla.
He is trying to come to you.	Uzama ukuza kuwe.
I don't want to know things.	Andifuni ukwazi izinto.
No one spoke to him.	Akukho mntu wathetha naye.
We have to go now.	Kufuneka sihambe ngoku.
I should not have told him.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ndimxelele.
This is good enough as it is.	Oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo njengoko kunjalo.
He looked worse than he thought.	Wayekhangeleka embi kunokuba wayecinga.
We really deserve it.	Sifanele ngokwenene.
Life together.	Ubomi kunye.
But one has to.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka.
That is your job now.	Ngumsebenzi wakho lowo ngoku.
This is probably.	Le mhlawumbi.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
Her mother was not at home.	Umama wakhe wayengekho ekhaya.
They will leave soon.	Baza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I want you to know that very quickly.	Ndifuna uyazi ukuba ngokukhawuleza.
He will not.	Akayi.
He advised.	Wacebisa.
I know why you are here.	Ndiyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
About the piano.	Malunga ipiyano.
Noise.	Nomsindo.
I never thought he existed.	Khange ndicinge ukuba ukhona.
He is in the hospital.	Ulele esibhedlele.
Getting good performance.	Ukufumana ukusebenza kakuhle.
This will be my reality.	Oku kuya kuba yinyani yam.
I don't really know.	Andikwazi ngokwenene.
Way, it is very difficult.	Indlela, kunzima kakhulu.
Until this book.	Kude kube le ncwadi.
Waiting is hard.	Ukulinda kunzima.
She just wanted to help her son.	Wayefuna nje ukunceda unyana wakhe.
There is no money in that.	Akukho mali kuloo nto.
Check the time.	Jonga ixesha.
Then make a decision about what seems right with each other.	Emva koko ukwenza isigqibo malunga nokuba yintoni ebonakala ilungile kunye.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
What is your name?	Ngubani igama lakho?
Thanks again for everything.	Enkosi kwakhona ngayo yonke into.
I am very much.	Mna kakhulu.
He spoke but did not.	Wathetha kodwa akazange.
I hope this is work for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba lo ngumsebenzi kuwe.
He is not.	Akanjalo.
I looked away.	Ndijonge kude.
That can be difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima.
Nothing to him.	Akukho nto kuye.
Not here, nowhere.	Hayi apha, akukho ndawo.
There is no reality there.	Akukho nyani apho.
Not so much, but something.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa into.
But then he understood.	Kodwa ke waqonda.
He had to be with her.	Kwafuneka abe naye.
He did not stop thinking.	Akazange ayeke ukucinga.
It was not just about him.	Kwakungekho ngaye kuphela.
Just stop thinking and it will come.	Yeka nje ukucinga kwaye kuya kuza.
Getting out of town.	Ukuphuma edolophini.
She told me a lot about him.	Wandixelela okuninzi ngaye.
This is just to imagine the whole problem away.	Oku nje ukucinga yonke ingxaki kude.
He will surely return at last.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kubuya ekugqibeleni.
He arrived first.	Wafika kuqala.
No one has ever done this before.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza le nto ngaphambili.
And every day to come.	Kwaye yonke imihla ezayo.
And no one.	Kwaye akukho mntu.
I don't want to see anyone.	Andifuni kubona mntu.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uzakuba nawe kungekudala.
And he did not make anyone.	Kwaye akenzanga mntu.
It wasn’t much, in the end, though.	Kwakungekho nto ingako, ekugqibeleni, nangona kunjalo.
You seem to be very scared of everything.	Ubonakala woyika kakhulu ngayo yonke into.
But he lives with it.	Kodwa uhlala nayo.
I wanted more children.	Ndandifuna abantwana abaninzi.
This is certainly not the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
I don't know how he knew.	Andazi ukuba wakwazi njani.
Really, that’s pretty cool.	Ngokwenene, oko kuhle kakhulu.
You know who's going to have it.	Uyazi ukuba ngubani oza kuba nayo.
If you will be.	Ukuba uya kuba.
He looked better at it.	Wayebonakala engcono kuyo.
Talking about it.	Ethetha ngayo.
It would be great, though.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I can't do it now.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngoku.
You can't stay.	Awukwazi ukuhlala.
There was not much room.	Kwakungekho ndawo ingako.
Few books.	Iincwadi ezimbalwa.
They didn't, but still.	Abazange, kodwa nangoko.
He talked a little bit about it.	Wathetha kancinci ngaloo nto.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uza kubuya.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
He did well on his own.	Wenza kakuhle yedwa.
I really mean that.	Ngenene ndithetha loo nto.
asked his mother.	wabuza umama wakhe.
That might be strange to him.	Loo nto inokuba yinto engaqhelekanga kuye.
That, of course, will not be.	Oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akayi kuba.
Give me a call.	Ndinike umnxeba.
And maybe he would like that.	Kwaye mhlawumbi angathanda oko.
He should go now, he thought.	Kufuneka ahambe ngoku, wacinga.
It will go well with it.	Iza kuhamba kakuhle kuyo.
Although.	Nangona.
And yet it never happened.	Kwaye kodwa akuzange kube njalo.
It is very difficult for all of us.	Kunzima kakhulu kuthi sonke.
He did it in the end.	Uyenzile ekugqibeleni.
Have you ever done.	Ngaba wakha wenza.
Probably everything.	Mhlawumbi yonke into.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni.
They stayed up late.	Baye bahlala emva kwexesha.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I don’t remember what it was exactly.	Andikhumbuli ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
You have to look inside yourself.	Kufuneka ujonge ngaphakathi kuwe.
And for how long.	Kwaye ixesha elingakanani.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe kancinci.
He wants me to go with him.	Ufuna ndihambe nam.
Yeah, really anything.	Ewe, ngokwenene nantoni na.
You want to get out, and you want to get out now.	Ufuna ukuphuma, kwaye ufuna ukuphuma ngoku.
He finally told me so.	Ekugqibeleni wandixelela njalo.
Two weeks.	Iiveki ezimbini.
I had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka ndenze isigqibo.
That will be very visible.	Oko kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
What are you talking about?	Uthetha ngantoni.
However, we need your help to get there.	Nangona kunjalo, sifuna uncedo lwakho ukuba siza kufika apho.
You will be something.	Uya kuba yinto ethile.
I'm glad she's here.	Ndiyavuya elapha.
He told me everything about it.	Wandixelela yonke into ngayo.
You will get yes.	Uya kufumana ewe.
I hope and I hope it won’t.	Ndiyathemba kwaye ndiyathemba ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuphinda kwakhona.
But even though that takes years.	Kodwa nangona oko kuthatha iminyaka.
You told someone you were fine.	Uxelele umntu ukuba ulungile.
He took my little girl.	Wathatha intombi yam encinci.
He did not want you to know.	Wayengafuni ukuba wazi.
Then he felt it too.	Emva koko waziva naye.
To do anything with that.	Ukwenza nantoni na ngaloo nto.
I try to stop thinking.	Ndizama ukuyeka ukucinga.
I did not know anyone.	Ndandingazi mntu omnye.
Yeah, look at me.	Ewe, ndijonge.
You look almost sorry.	Ujonge phantse uxolo.
Someone has to make it happen.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze yenzeke.
And then he will come.	Kwaye ke uya kuza.
I know you can be beautiful.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyakwazi ukuba mhle.
My dad doesn't want to be alone.	Utata akafuni ukuba yedwa.
We did things.	Senze izinto.
Definitely a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo indawo.
I want to read a book.	Ndifuna ukufunda incwadi.
Not all at once, though.	Akunjalo konke ngexesha elinye, nangona kunjalo.
Certainly death is almost instantaneous.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukufa phantse kube ngoko nangoko.
You haven't said much today.	Khange uthethe kakhulu namhlanje.
He did not want that.	Akazange afune oko.
But this did not happen at all.	Kodwa oku akuzange kwenzeke konke konke.
I know what the problem is!	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki!
I can't tell you.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela.
As difficult as that may be.	Njengokuba inokuba nzima kangakanani loo nto.
This task became difficult for him.	Lo msebenzi waba nzima kuye.
It is best to arrive early.	Kungcono ukufika kwangethuba.
He spent years making money.	Wachitha iminyaka esenza imali.
You look tired.	Ukhangeleka ngathi udiniwe.
No one else spoke to him.	Akakho omnye umntu athethe naye.
It seemed like nothing at the time.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akukho nto ngelo xesha.
The woman, however, has come forward.	Umfazi, nangona kunjalo, uye weza ngaphambili.
So you have to tell.	Ngoko kufuneka uxelele.
I am here next to you.	Ndilapha ecaleni kwakho.
I told you to come.	Ndikuxelele ukuba uze.
Good to have you this morning.	Kuhle ukuba nawe ngale ntsasa.
Very, probably.	Kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
I don't know if this is right.	Andazi noba ilungile na lento.
She asked my mother.	Uye wabuza umama.
This, however, did not happen immediately.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akuzange kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
I just got down.	Ndifike nje phantsi.
And he will, too.	Kwaye uya kwenza, naye.
Yes, indeed, it is his work.	Ewe, ngokwenene, ngumsebenzi wakhe.
You have, of course.	Unayo, kunjalo.
But nobody really.	Kodwa akukho mntu ngokwenene.
In the same room.	Kwigumbi elinye.
Nobody says he did that.	Akukho mntu uthi wayenza loo nto.
Travel is fine.	Ukuhamba kulungile.
It seems really hard.	Kubonakala kunzima ngokwenene.
But that would be unusual.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
I did my best.	Ndenze konke okusemandleni.
But all that.	Kodwa konke oko.
There was nothing to it.	Kwakungekho nto kuloo nto.
But no.	Kodwa akukho.
It's so hard that way.	Kunzima kakhulu ngaloo ndlela.
Everything is going well.	Konke kuhamba kakuhle.
And that means we have to go.	Kwaye oko kuthetha ukuba kufuneka sihambe.
Sorry, but you have it.	Uxolo, kodwa unayo.
He knew he had done it.	Wayesazi ukuba wenze njalo.
Three people.	Abantu abathathu.
He would surely go eventually.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuhamba ekugqibeleni.
What's his name?	Ngubani igama lakhe.
Maybe I didn't want to know.	Mhlawumbi ndandingafuni ukwazi.
I can't believe he even wanted to do this.	Andikholelwa nokuba wayefuna ukuyenza le nto.
Now you're sure about that.	Ngoku uqinisekile ngaye kuloo nto.
The doctor is a good man.	Ugqirha yindoda elungileyo.
That is the problem.	Ingxaki ke leyo.
Money is needed.	Kufuneka imali.
He did not want to get angry.	Wayengafuni ukuba nomsindo.
Do you know that.	Ngaba uyazi loo nto.
I knew exactly where everyone was.	Ndandisazi kakuhle ukuba wonke umntu uphi.
I have never been here.	Andizange ndilapha.
I think it is good.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile.
By the time he got back to bed.	Ngexesha wabuyela ebhedini.
I don't care to do that.	Andikhathali ukwenza loo nto.
You are right.	Uqinisekile.
Evidently, he too was scared.	Kucacile ukuba naye wayesoyika.
It means something is right.	Kuthetha ukuba kukho into elungileyo.
He didn't go very far.	Akazange ahambe kakhulu.
But not with him.	Kodwa hayi naye.
He says it's time.	Uthi lixesha.
He will not come to you.	Akayi kuza kuwe.
No one told her to do this.	Akukho mntu wamxelela ukuba ayenze le nto.
And not so much one.	Kwaye hayi kakhulu enye.
It certainly can.	Ngokuqinisekileyo inokuba njalo.
It has never happened before.	Ayizange yenzeke ngaphambili.
We need to do this.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto.
I did what I had to do.	Ndenze into ekufuneka ndiyenzile.
Is this possible.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka.
But there was nowhere for him to go.	Kodwa kwakungekho ndawo yokuba aye kuyo.
It was nothing, of course.	Kwakungekho nto, kunjalo.
And I saw my doctor.	Kwaye ndibone ugqirha wam.
I would not want that.	Andiyi kufuna loo nto.
But there is.	Kodwa kukho.
I will stay.	Ndiza kuhlala.
We too want peace.	Nathi sifuna uxolo.
He would go with you.	Wayeza kuhamba nawe.
He must have gone again.	Umele ukuba wahamba kwakhona.
I know you.	Ndiyakwazi.
Only he did not for sure.	Kuphela akazange ngokuqinisekileyo.
Someone did that, of course.	Kukho umntu owenza loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
But there was no place.	Kodwa kwakungekho ndawo.
No no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi.
Whatever it was, he didn't know.	Nokuba yintoni na, wayengazi.
He is a man.	Yindoda.
And then.	Ke ngoku.
There is a woman there.	Kukho umfazi phaya.
Everything will be.	Konke kuya kuba .
But you know what happens.	Kodwa uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Just like we did this morning.	Kanye njengokuba senze ngale ntsasa.
Maybe you said something.	Mhlawumbi uthethe into.
There was nothing he would like more.	Kwakungekho nto angathanda ngakumbi.
He saw his mother.	Wabona umama wakhe.
I learned a little bit.	Ndize kancinci.
Or otherwise.	Okanye ngenye indlela.
Later, he asked me to stay longer.	Kamva, wandicela ukuba ndihlale ixesha elide.
I don't really know.	Andazi nyani.
And all this has happened because of you.	Kwaye konke oku kwenzeke ngenxa yakho.
I learned a lot from it.	Ndifunde okuninzi kuyo.
But, we'll see.	Kodwa, siza kubona.
He didn't even know if he would be able to do it.	Wayengazi nokuba uya kukwazi na ukwenza.
One small to go.	Enye encinci ukuya.
So good.	Ilungile kakhulu.
You probably know why.	Mhlawumbi uyasazi isizathu.
Long ago.	Kudala ke .
I just thought you should know.	Ndicinge nje ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
I can't imagine why he wants this.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni efuna oku.
My parents live there.	Abazali bam bahlala apho.
I want to know how you do it.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba wenza njani.
But he was thinking of something.	Kodwa wayecinga ngento ethile.
It just so happens that it does.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
He was not angry.	Akazange abe nomsindo.
At first, nothing.	Ekuqaleni, akukho nto.
What do you like to eat?	Uthanda ukutya ntoni?
I don't want to be you, either.	Andifuni ukuba nguwe, nam.
Then to me.	Emva koko kum.
Probably a lot more.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu ngakumbi.
It was clear he did not know what to do.	Kwakucacile ukuba wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni.
I think it comes too late.	Ndicinga ukuba iza emva kwexesha.
In one way or another.	Ngendlela enye okanye enye.
Time for me to go.	Ixesha lokuba ndihambe.
What and man?	Yintoni kwaye umntu?
You learn from him.	Ufunda kuye.
That will come next week.	Oko kuya kufika kwiveki ezayo.
So I am the only one.	Ngoko ndim kuphela.
Then he left.	Uhambe ke.
He wanted to find a wife for himself.	Wayefuna ukufumana umfazi yedwa.
So, way, way, down.	Ngoko ke, indlela, indlela, phantsi.
Tell me it's not.	Ndixelele ukuba akunjalo.
I know my problem.	Ndiyayazi ingxaki yam.
This is especially true.	Yinyani nje le meko.
He said he was fine.	Wathi ulungile.
It gets better, obviously.	Kuba ngcono, ngokucacileyo.
Book only.	Incwadi kuphela.
Now, another thing.	Ngoku, enye into.
Not so much since then.	Hayi kakhulu ukusukela ngoko.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
Then it can be very good.	Emva koko kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
However, the question is correct.	Nangona kunjalo, umbuzo ulungile.
I told her, nothing.	Ndamxelela, akukho nto.
And they will, because they have to.	Kwaye baya kwenza, kuba kufuneka.
No one will stay here.	Akukho mntu uza kuhlala apha.
It has to be made to happen.	Kufuneka yenziwe ukuba yenzeke.
Belong to! 	Yeka!
Or walking.	Okanye ukuhamba.
He may be sleeping.	Inokuba ulele.
So it will be again.	Ngoko kuya kuba njalo kwakhona.
I'm happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngawe.
I would like to see that.	Ndingathanda ukubona oko.
So give me a number.	Ngoko ndinike inombolo.
He felt better though.	Waziva engcono kodwa.
I don't know what happened to it now.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuyo ngoku.
Ok then.	Kulungile, ke.
This can be fun.	Oku kunokuba mnandi.
I wanted to see you again.	Bendifuna ukubona kwakhona.
He did not know how long he had been here.	Wayengazi ukuba unexesha elingakanani elapha.
I haven't thought about any of that for years and then.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo nayiphi na loo nto iminyaka kwaye emva koko.
You have to stay with me.	Kufuneka uhlale nam.
He wants to stay there.	Ufuna ukuhlala apho.
I'll see if you can do that.	Ndiza kubona ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
Very much this.	Kakhulu oku.
Does that mean.	Ngaba oko kuthetha.
And he saw something else.	Kwaye wabona enye into.
But we know we will.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba siya kwenza njalo.
Not only at home but especially at work.	Hayi kuphela ekhaya kodwa ngakumbi emsebenzini.
Because he knew.	Kuba wayesazi.
I want something else.	Ndifuna enye into.
The talk will take three hours.	Intetho iya kuthatha iiyure ezintathu.
He stays in bed for two days	Uhleli ebhedini iintsuku ezimbini
He dropped out of college.	Waphuma ekholejini.
I've thought a lot about this.	Ndiye ndacinga kakhulu ngale nto.
This takes a very long time.	Oku kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
And, of course it is.	Kwaye, ngokwenene kunjalo.
I will.	Ndiza.
Please look forward to it !.	Nceda ujonge phambili kuyo!.
To us.	Kuthi.
He wanted more, more.	Wayefuna okuninzi, ngakumbi.
There is something wonderful about that.	Kukho into entle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
Not just if you live there.	Hayi nje ukuba uhlala khona.
It should have been done immediately.	Bekufanele ukuba yenziwe ngoko nangoko.
I knew it better than I did at school.	Ndandisazi ngcono kunokuba ndithethe ngayo esikolweni.
Please sit down.	Ndicela uhlale phantsi.
Immediately.	Ngoko nangoko.
If you have returned.	Ukuba uye wabuyela.
The answer is, not so much.	Impendulo kukuba, hayi kakhulu.
You need to act fast.	Kufuneka wenze ngokukhawuleza.
I have to stay here.	Kufuneka ndihlale apha.
But clearly not at this time.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo hayi ngeli xesha.
I looked out.	Ndijonge phandle.
If you have it.	Ukuba unayo.
As he wanted it to be.	Njengoko wayefuna ukuba kube njalo.
There is no need to make a big deal out of it.	Akukho mfuneko yokwenza into enkulu ngayo.
He never had it in this situation.	Akazange abe nayo kule meko.
Can someone please tell me what is wrong with it.	Ngaba umntu ndicela andixelele ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngayo.
I did not know things otherwise.	Ndandingazi izinto ngenye indlela.
Please check back soon !.	Nceda ujonge kungekudala!.
This is not me, obviously.	Ayindim lo, ngokucacileyo.
No, not now.	Hayi, hayi ngoku.
But, in the end, he said nothing.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, akazange athethe nto.
We will be back.	Siza kubuya.
He did, too.	Uyenzile, naye.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Mhlawumbi kukho into enjalo.
I want one, though.	Ndifuna enye, nangona kunjalo.
I should not have gone.	Bekungafanelanga ndihambe.
I do not think he appeared.	Andiqondi ukuba wabonakala.
It was clear that we would need help.	Kwakucacile ukuba siza kufuna uncedo.
When there was no one.	Xa kwakungekho mntu.
You do not have to do this now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze le nto ngoku.
He tried to speak but could not.	Wazama ukuthetha kodwa akakwazi.
However, you already know that.	Kodwa ke, sele uyazi ukuba.
Yes, a good man.	Ewe, umntu olungileyo.
I am again.	Ndim kwakhona.
Before we leave.	Phambi kokuba sihambe.
That's all true.	Yonke loo nto yinyani.
This is not easy to do.	Oku akukho lula ukwenza.
Yeah, enough for me.	Ewe, ngokwaneleyo ngam.
He did not do the work himself.	Akazange enze msebenzi ngokwakhe.
And then there was none.	Kwaye ke kwakungekho.
I never heard from him again.	Zange ndiphinde ndive ngaye.
It is not very easy to say.	Akukho lula kakhulu ukuthetha.
So you told me.	Undixelele ke wena.
There, it's better.	Apho, kungcono.
And maybe not necessary.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko.
It all goes together in the right place.	Konke kuhamba kunye kwindawo elungileyo.
That's 'there'.	Nantso 'apho'.
You know what's going on.	Uyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
That is it.	Yiyo le nto.
Just a lot of travel.	Ukuhamba nje okuninzi.
And then wait.	Kwaye emva koko ukulinda.
He did not seek employment.	Akazange afune umsebenzi.
Being alone in everything.	Ukuba wedwa kuyo yonke into.
Or because of you.	Okanye ngenxa yakho.
Then he did something good.	Emva koko wenza into entle.
Not for me.	Hayi ngam.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Andazi ke ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
He wanted to drive, but could not.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba, kodwa akazange akwazi.
To be so.	Ukuze kube njalo.
They will definitely do it the right way !.	Ngokwenene baya kuyenza ngendlela elungileyo!.
And now, he thought.	Ke ngoku, wacinga.
I feel that way now.	Ndiziva njalo ngoku.
I want to meet him later.	Ndifuna ukudibana naye kamva.
So you think you're smart, don't you?	Ngoko ucinga ukuba ukrelekrele, akunjalo?
And now, he doesn't want to.	Kwaye ngoku, akafuni.
But not me and him.	Kodwa hayi mna naye.
I can't sit up in bed.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ebhedini.
He told me to do it.	Wandixelela ukuba wenze njalo.
She is right in her own way.	Ulungile ngendlela yakhe.
See what you learn from it.	Jonga ukuba ufunda ntoni kuyo.
Thank you !!.	Enkosi !!.
He left town.	Waphuma edolophini.
Obviously.	Ngokucacileyo.
I knew something was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into ezayo.
Who wants to drive?	Ngubani ofuna ukuqhuba?
I'm afraid to do something.	Ndiyoyika ukwenza into.
I can’t imagine myself doing it on my own.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba ndiyenza ngokwam.
You need to be your friend.	Kufuneka ube ngumhlobo wakho.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
And that, too, is.	Kwaye oko, kwakhona, kukho.
Small.	Encinci.
I don't think it's a bad thing.	Andiqondi ukuba yinto embi.
It happened that way this time.	Kwenzeke ngolo hlobo ngeli xesha.
That's all he has.	Yinto yakhe yonke leyo.
You have to stay busy.	Kufuneka uhlale uxakekile.
We'll see how it happens.	Siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka njani.
He went into the bedroom.	Wangena egumbini lokulala.
I would love to go out with you again.	Ndingathanda ukuphuma nawe kwakhona.
Yes, the voice.	Ewe, ilizwi.
So do I.	Kunjalo nam.
I don't want to talk about it.	Andifuni kuthetha ngayo.
Nothing will happen to you.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka kuwe.
I really never thought about it.	Ngokwenene andizange ndicinge ngayo.
He lives at work.	Uhlala emsebenzini.
He had to do so.	Kwafuneka enjenjalo.
You will have to think of something else.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngenye into.
One he hoped he would never do.	Enye wayenethemba lokuba akanakuze ayenze.
He studied music at night.	Wafunda umculo ebusuku.
To know more about him.	Ukuze wazi ngakumbi ngaye.
I read this at one time.	Ndifunde oku ngexesha elinye.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza le nto.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
I'm sure it isn't.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akunjalo.
And that's a good thing.	Kwaye into entle.
Well, it's good for him.	Ewe, kuhle kuye.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu wenza njalo.
Self-control everywhere is fine.	Ukuzibamba kuyo yonke indawo kulungile.
But he will probably not try to find a place.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akayi kuzama indawo.
You know what this is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni le.
And it's hard to stop.	Kwaye kunzima ukuyeka.
I know nothing about that.	Andazi nto ngaloo nto.
I don't care to do that once.	Andikhathali ukwenza oko kube kanye.
Probably a lot of the time.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elininzi.
Well, enough.	Kulungile, ngokwaneleyo.
So, for a long time.	Ngoko, ixesha elide.
She will never have it again.	Soze aphinde abe nayo.
I'm so sorry, so sorry.	Uxolo kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.
I can't talk to you.	Andikwazi kuthetha nawe.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
And sit down, sit down.	Kwaye uhlale phantsi, uhlale phantsi.
But only in this area.	Kodwa kuphela kule ndawo.
I was there.	Ngaba phaya.
You just look like him.	Ufana nje naye.
Definitely no problem.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ngxaki.
Really good.	Kuhle ngokwenene.
Maybe somehow.	Mhlawumbi indlela ethile.
Just then,	Nje ngoko,
He didn't have to leave now.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ahambe ngoku.
And anyone can do it.	Kwaye nabani na angayenza.
I mean her mother.	Ndithetha umama wakhe.
There was no movement.	Kwakungekho kuhamba.
I apologize for all this like you.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke lento njengawe.
I had to think fast.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngokukhawuleza.
I will not have it in my house.	Andiyi kuba nayo endlwini yam.
Doing homework takes time.	Ukwenza umsebenzi wesikolo wasekhaya kuthatha ixesha.
Yes, so far.	Ewe, kude kube ngoku.
I really should.	Ngenene ndifanele.
Then he lay down.	Emva koko, walala phantsi.
It's just that it's hard to do that.	Kuphela kukuba kunzima ukwenza oko.
That's me.	Ndim ke lowo.
So it will be seen.	Ngoko kuya kubonakala.
He wasn't, but you know.	Wayengekho, kodwa uyazi.
I can't say when.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba nini.
The question is how to do it.	Umbuzo kukuba uyenza njani.
Obviously, one outside.	Ngokucacileyo, enye ngaphandle.
He just walked in.	Wangena nje.
As it is, he cannot.	Njengoko kunjalo, akakwazi.
He lives alone now.	Uhlala yedwa ngoku.
Now give me the phone.	Ngoku ndinike ifowuni.
It seemed real.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinyani.
Then we will decide what to do.	Emva koko siya kuthatha isigqibo sokuba senze ntoni.
But he did not think so.	Kodwa akazange acinge njalo.
Do we want to talk more?	Ngaba sifuna ukuthetha ngakumbi?
I didn't say anything, of course.	Andizange ndithethe nto, kunjalo.
But he kept talking.	Kodwa waqhubeka ethetha.
Not far away.	Akukho kude.
Not for us.	Hayi kuthi.
One tomorrow.	Omnye ngomso.
In the same way.	Ngendlela enye.
One knows it.	Omnye uyayazi.
He quickly looked around the room.	Wajonga ngokukhawuleza egumbini.
Eventually he will arrive.	Ekugqibeleni uya kufika.
I can't wait.	Andikwazi ukulinda.
We are not going anywhere.	Asiyi ndawo.
Only the truth.	Kuphela inyaniso.
His mother could not.	Umama wakhe akazange akwazi.
The more things, the better.	Izinto ezininzi, ngcono.
I don't think so.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo.
Cool.	Kuhle.
I'm sure he didn't.	Ndiqinisekile akazange.
I told him a good job.	Ndamxelela umsebenzi omhle.
His mother was not there.	Umama wakhe wayengekho.
I'm not going to college though.	Andiyi ekholejini kodwa.
And everyone went.	Kwaye wonke umntu wahamba.
I like that way, you know.	Ndiyayithanda loo ndlela, uyazi.
I don't know about this.	Andazi ngale nto.
Finally he opened the door and went inside.	Ekugqibeleni wavula ucango wangena.
As it never happened.	Njengokuba akuzange kwenzeke.
Walking the dog has never been so fun !.	Ukuhamba inja akuzange kube mnandi kakhulu!.
He wanted to know, he needed to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi, kufuneka azi.
I tried to approach him.	Ndazama ukuya kuye.
Too many ways.	Indlela ezininzi kakhulu.
And you know, too.	Kwaye uyazi, naye.
To know this you do not need to think.	Ukuze ukwazi oku akuyomfuneko ukuba ucinge.
As well .	Njengokuba .
And really everywhere.	Kwaye ngokwenene yonke indawo.
He has fallen asleep.	Uye walala.
What he wants.	Into ayifunayo.
This?	Le nto?
I wanted one in my house.	Ndandifuna enye endlwini yam.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
It may be the first to come first.	Inokuba ngowokuqala ukuza kuqala.
wife.	umfazi.
He asked me a few questions about me.	Wandibuza imibuzo embalwa ngam.
They went to bed when he arrived.	Baye ebhedini ukufika kwakhe.
That's why he came in.	Yiyo loo nto wangena.
If you study hard, you will succeed.	Ukuba ufunda nzima, uya kuphumelela.
And maybe he died.	Kwaye mhlawumbi wafa.
One big problem.	Ingxaki enye enkulu.
Let me speak.	Makhe ndithethe.
You better think more.	Kungcono ucinge kakhulu.
Getting out.	Ukuphuma.
So just look.	Ngoko jonga nje.
She has become a child.	Uye waba ngumntwana.
If not, nothing will happen.	Ukuba akukho, akukho nto iya kwenzeka.
Can anyone do that.	Ngaba umntu angayenza loo nto.
He thought he would never get there.	Wayecinga ukuba uya kuze afike apho.
He said he knew it.	Wathi uyayazi.
Otherwise it seems to go well.	Ngaphandle koko kubonakala kuhamba kakuhle.
As it will be easier.	Njengoko kuya kuba lula.
In the morning.	Ekuseni.
And he realized something else.	Kwaye waqonda enye into.
If that is it.	Ukuba yiloo nto.
Here is my letter.	Nantso ileta yam.
No one ever told me anything.	Akukho mntu wakha wandixelela nto.
And it's good that you have to.	Kwaye kuhle ukuba kufuneka.
To stay with him.	Ukuze ahlale naye.
All or nothing.	Konke okanye akukho nto.
Very good mind.	Ingqondo entle kakhulu.
So what.	Ngoko ke yintoni.
No money.	Akukho mali.
That is a fact no one wants to talk about.	Leyo yinyani akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
However, there is one minor problem.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki enye encinci.
Thank you, you did everything.	Enkosi, uyenzile yonke into.
Thanks again, for everything.	Enkosi kwakhona, ngayo yonke into.
I can't do one job.	Andikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi omnye.
And there is a reason.	Kwaye kukho isizathu.
He never said that.	Akazange athethe loo nto.
You have to go with him there.	Kufuneka uhambe naye apho.
I'm just telling the truth.	Ndithetha inyani kuphela.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I told you this.	Ndikuxelele oku.
You learn something new every day.	Ufunda into entsha yonke imihla.
Trying to do too much.	Ukuzama ukwenza kakhulu.
He did not mention his work.	Akazange athethe ngomsebenzi wakhe.
But this time he returned home.	Kodwa ngeli xesha wabuyela ekhaya.
But he did not come very far.	Kodwa akazange afike kakhulu.
Not waiting, talking, just doing.	Hayi ukulinda, ukuthetha, ukwenza nje.
Probably him.	Mhlawumbi kuye.
He can't wait to meet you.	Akakwazi ukulinda ukudibana nawe.
He did so immediately.	Wenze njalo kwangoko.
He must stay with us.	Ufanele ahlale nathi.
I would like alcohol.	Ndifuna utywala.
He asked me what that was.	Wandibuza ukuba yintoni leyo.
Everyone except him.	Wonke umntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
He does what he has to do.	Uyayenza into ekufuneka ayenze.
See what happens when you work hard?	Jonga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni xa usebenza nzima?
I did not look anywhere.	Khange ndijonge ndawo.
If you have done this thank you.	Ukuba uyenzile le nto enkosi.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
I think he did a lot for her.	Ndicinga ukuba wenza kakhulu ngaye.
You want so much.	Ufuna kakhulu.
I just know it.	Ndiyayazi nje.
You never did that.	Awuzange uyenze loo nto.
I do not want a job.	Andifuni msebenzi.
It would certainly be nice to have it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba kuhle ukuba nayo.
How long does it take.	Kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
We will not stay.	Asiyi kuhlala.
I like that place.	Ndiyayithanda loo ndawo.
Everyone knows the person.	Wonke umntu uyazi umntu.
You will arrive on time.	Uza kufika kwangethuba.
And he didn't even want to have it.	Kwaye wayengafuni nokuba nayo.
Something very unusual is happening here.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo apha.
Certainly not, he thought.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo, wacinga njalo.
She is interested.	Unomdla.
I didn't really want to know.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi nyani.
If you don't want to be friends with me, that's fine.	Ukuba awufuni ukuba ngumhlobo nam, kulungile.
I just love it.	Ndiyayithanda nje.
His work is always the same.	Umsebenzi wakhe uhlala ufana.
Yes, just a few things.	Ewe, izinto ezimbalwa nje.
I thought you were going to be angry.	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba nomsindo.
Coffee is good here.	Ikofu ilungile apha.
However nothing.	Nangona kunjalo akukho nto.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
Ultimately, one has to make a decision.	Ekugqibeleni, umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
He ate his breakfast slowly.	Watya isidlo sakusasa sakhe kancinci kancinci.
I had to do.	Kwafuneka ndenze.
Ready to go.	Le ukuhamba.
Clearly, she too is tired.	Kucacile ukuba naye udiniwe.
I hope they go away soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
However, no one.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho mntu.
He walks there.	Uhamba apho.
Everyone knows what to think.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba yintoni ukucinga.
She builds flowers.	Wakha iintyatyambo.
One of me probably knows that better.	Omnye wam mhlawumbi uyayazi ngakumbi loo nto.
The food was clear though.	Ukutya kwakucacile kodwa.
Because you live outside.	Ngenxa yokuba uhlala ngaphandle.
He did not know anyone.	Wayengazi mntu.
It was clear that this was it.	Kwakucacile ukuba yiyo le.
Now you have a problem.	Ngoku unengxaki.
You should be here now.	Bekufanele ukuba ulapha ngoku.
He did not think it was possible.	Wayengacingi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I need to talk to her now.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoku.
It is a very strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ngokwenene.
Just to help.	Ukunceda nje.
There is plenty of room.	Kukho indawo eninzi.
I will succeed.	Ndiya kuphumelela.
Only.	Kuphela.
I want more.	Ndifuna kakhulu.
You do not really want that to happen.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukuba oko kwenzeke.
You should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
It had to be that way.	Kwafuneka kube njalo.
Staying with us.	Ukuhlala nathi.
That's it.	Yiyo.
He heard his voice at night.	Weva ilizwi lakhe ebusuku.
But look at you.	Kodwa jonga wena.
Nobody lives there.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho.
I did it myself.	Ndiyenzile ngokwam lonto.
Finally you must say no.	Ekugqibeleni kufuneka uthi hayi.
But one does not have to stay in that for long.	Kodwa akufuneki umntu ahlale kuloo nto ixesha elide.
Slowly, but surely.	Kancinci, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
But tomorrow it will be.	Kodwa ngomso uya kuba.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
I want to find out.	Ndifuna ukufumana.
He had to look for food.	Kwafuneka afune ukutya.
He never got nowhere with that.	Akazange afike ndawo ngaloo nto.
He will leave soon.	Uza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Give it to me now.	Ndinike ngoku.
It's one thing or another.	Yinto enye okanye enye.
Sorry about that, then.	Uxolo ngawe, ke.
You just want to get out.	Ufuna nje ukuphuma.
It is very difficult to talk about it.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngayo.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba kube njalo.
Mom came out.	Waphuma uMama.
I did very well.	Ndenze kakuhle kakhulu.
If you think you don’t want to, you are not going.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba awufuni, awuyi.
It is not that easy.	Akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
I can't get enough of this song.	Andikwazi kufumana ngokwaneleyo le ngoma.
Tell me again.	Ndixelele kwakhona.
You will talk about it.	Uya kuthetha ngayo.
Not your parents.	Hayi abazali bakho.
I would like to stay.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala .
You came to my house today.	Uze kwam namhlanje.
But there is a truth.	Kodwa kukho inyaniso.
He would go with her in the afternoon.	Wayeza kuhamba naye emva kwemini.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
Not in college.	Hayi ekholejini.
It's a really good job.	Ngumsebenzi olungileyo ngenene.
He wanted a wife.	Wayefuna umfazi.
It will take a few hours.	Iza kuthatha iiyure ezimbalwa.
He did much better.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu.
We will be together.	Siya kuba kunye.
Or just me.	Okanye ndim nje.
But the same thing happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka into efanayo.
I just want you to know.	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi.
Time passed with him.	Kwaphela ixesha naye.
I start again.	Ndiyaqala kwakhona.
And here it is.	Kwaye yile.
My father did nothing.	Utata akenzanga nto.
Is he.	Ngaba nguye.
He found another plan.	Wafumana elinye icebo.
I want to see something.	Ndifuna ukubona into.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Kodwa, kubonakala kukho ingxaki.
There is some music for me but his.	Kukho omnye umculo kum kodwa wakhe.
I know what's right now.	Ndiyazi into elungileyo ngoku.
I would like to see the whole room.	Ndingathanda ukubona igumbi lonke.
He looked at his wife.	Wajonga umfazi wakhe.
But we will not try to get out.	Kodwa asiyi kuzama ukuphuma.
I'm not sure what it will mean.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kuthetha ntoni na.
He died.	Wafa.
There is one positive thing in this situation though.	Kukho into enye entle kule meko nangona kunjalo.
I tried once.	Ndazama kanye.
Too much money, as it were.	Imali eninzi kakhulu, njengoko kunjalo.
Not a day.	Hayi imini.
But flowers before.	Kodwa iintyatyambo ngaphambili.
Or in this case.	Okanye kule meko.
I thought about this.	Ndacinga ngale nto.
Long, long ago.	Kudala, kudala kakhulu.
Time travel is possible.	Ukuhamba ixesha kunokwenzeka.
Everyone knew.	Wonke umntu wayesazi.
Certainly not!	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo!
Not today, though.	Hayi namhlanje, nangona kunjalo.
if possible.	ukuba kunokuba.
He won't have that.	Akayi kuba nayo loo nto.
That will make it harder for me to help you.	Oko kuya kwenza kube nzima kum ukukunceda.
He apologized many times.	Wacela uxolo izihlandlo ezininzi.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
He had to come.	Kwafuneka eze.
I can't walk for long.	Andikwazi ukuhamba ixesha elide.
You do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukwenjenjalo.
Great man.	Umntu omkhulu.
The music continued to play.	Umculo waqhubeka udlala.
That's the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela ke kunjalo.
But not my people.	Kodwa hayi abantu bam.
I can't win with him.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela naye.
All of that will take days.	Konke oko kuya kuthatha iintsuku ezininzi.
He said he did not tell anyone.	Wathi akazange axelele mntu.
I don't really know how to do this.	Andazi nyani ukuba ndingayenza njani le nto.
Unless you are ready to work.	Ngaphandle kokuba ukulungele ukusebenza.
And now, one thing before you go.	Kwaye ngoku, into enye ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
Not with him, that's for sure.	Hayi kunye naye, oko ngokuqinisekileyo.
I thought it was impossible.	Ndandicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
It certainly seemed possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakubonakala ngathi kunokwenzeka.
Is this okay.	Ngaba oku kulungile.
I'll buy that.	Ndiza kuthenga oko.
Don't talk about him.	Musa ukuthetha ngaye.
I can do that place.	Ndingayenza loo ndawo.
He wants to be a man.	Uyafuna ukuba yindoda.
A little too good.	Kancinci kuhle kakhulu.
He did not think where he was.	Khange acinge ukuba uphi.
I could not control myself.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba.
People will start moving soon.	Abantu baza kuqala ukuhamba kungekudala.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze.
He lay back here a few times.	Walala ngasemva apha izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
Two hours, three very.	Iiyure ezimbini, ezintathu kakhulu.
Suddenly, he ran away.	Ngokukhawuleza, wabaleka.
You are that person.	Nguwe loo mntu.
About me and you.	Malunga nam nawe.
However he does not want to go.	Nangona kunjalo akafuni ukuya.
I hope to meet him again.	Ndiyathemba ukudibana naye kwakhona.
I don't believe he does this to you.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenza le nto kuwe.
He tried to speak, but he could not speak.	Wazama ukuthetha, kodwa akakwazi ukuthetha.
See you next week!.	Ndiza kubona kwiveki ezayo!.
He did not try his best.	Akazange azame icebo lakhe.
So before you go, let me see.	Ke phambi kokuba uhambe, ndibone.
She's too old for him, of course.	Mdala kakhulu kuye, kunjalo.
I did it once in a while.	Ndenze kanye ngexesha.
So this is great for that.	Ngoko oku kuhle kakhulu ukuba.
I better go now.	Kungcono ndihambe ngoku.
He said he talked to you.	Uthe wathetha nawe.
And really that sounds good.	Kwaye ngenene oko kubonakala kulungile.
He just doesn't know it.	Akayazi nje.
And it's all because you didn't know you were right.	Kwaye konke ngenxa yokuba ubungazi ukuba ulungile.
He wanted to be away from her.	Wayefuna ukuba kude naye.
So this is no question.	Ngoko ke oku akukho mbuzo.
I just want you.	Ndifuna nje wena.
Please stay away from this place!	Nceda uhlale kude kule ndawo!
One of us will try.	Omnye wethu uza kuzama.
No, no dog.	Hayi, hayi inja.
He didn't have her, for that.	Akazange naye, ngaloo nto.
What you need to do.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile.
I don't have to tell you.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndikuxelele.
No, nothing yet.	Hayi, akukho nto okwangoku.
What do you want, she wondered.	Ufuna ntoni, wazibuza.
Good job, though.	Umsebenzi omhle, nangona kunjalo.
He's not going up.	Akayi phezulu.
I want to learn from you.	Ndifuna ukufunda kuwe.
He always thought.	Wayecinga njalo.
You will get something.	Uya kufumana into.
When he wants to do something he does it.	Xa efuna ukwenza into uyayenza.
You were not there.	Awuzange ube khona.
But some people will do it.	Kodwa abanye abantu baya kuyenza.
But he was not and never was.	Kodwa wayengekho kwaye akazange.
As much as you want.	Kangangoko ufuna.
There is so much to do.	Kukho into eninzi yokwenza.
That is true enough.	Yinyani ngokwaneleyo leyo.
Outside, it is not.	Ngaphandle, akunjalo.
How you are doing.	Uqhuba njani.
What's wrong.	Yintoni embi.
Thank you so much to her.	Enkosi kakhulu kuye.
And you may be right.	Kwaye usenokuba ulungile.
Please take a look.	Nceda ujonge.
Not anything.	Hayi nantoni na.
Maybe it will continue for years.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuqhubeka iminyaka.
I did not tell him otherwise.	Khange ndimxelele ngenye indlela.
He walked out.	Waphuma phandle.
He has done that before.	Uyenzile loo nto ngaphambili.
He did not want to talk any more.	Akazange afune ukuthetha ngakumbi.
You know, it doesn't have to be this way.	Uyazi, akufuneki ukuba kube ngolu hlobo.
Or he thought he had it.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba unayo.
I do not have much money.	Andinayo imali eninzi.
She passed the test.	Uphumelele uvavanyo.
But that is exactly what it is.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye.
So off he went.	Ngoko wahamba.
This will make your job easier, even more so.	Oku kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula, ngakumbi.
I don't know what happened to me.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni ngam.
I thought there was no need.	Ndandicinga ukuba akukho mfuneko.
Maybe you're here.	Mhlawumbi ulapha.
But he did not know why.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
Big and small.	Enkulu kunye encinci.
Then he came to me.	Weza ke kum.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani.
Maybe that will go a long way.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kude.
I don't think anyone is going to make it a problem.	Andiqondi ukuba kukho umntu oza kuyenza ingxaki.
Definitely human.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngumntu.
Maybe he would go.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuhamba.
So much for that.	Kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I thought he was going to go.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kuya.
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
But otherwise you are right.	Kodwa ngenye indlela ulungile.
I know that, now.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngoku.
And you know how lucky you are.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani na.
What's the matter with you? 	Ingaba yintoni ingxaki nawe?
He has to leave right away.	Kufuneka ahambe kwangoko.
Music.	Umculo.
But it was very fun.	Kodwa kube mnandi kakhulu.
I just want to win.	Ndifuna nje ukuphumelela.
Nobody did that again.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto kwakhona.
Please make a good person.	Nceda wenze umntu olungileyo.
I'm not sure, really.	Andiqinisekanga, ngenene.
And so that's it.	Kwaye ke loo nto.
You and only you will.	Wena kwaye kuphela uya kwenza.
He will be a good player.	Uzakuba ngumdlali olungileyo.
I haven't looked back since.	Khange ndijonge ngasemva ukusukela oko.
Whatever it does.	Nantoni na iya kwenza.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi.
All this.	Konke oku .
Finally he came to his house.	Ekugqibeleni wafika endlwini yakhe.
Completely for the money.	Ngokupheleleyo ngemali.
You will be.	Uya kuba.
We are going to my house.	Siya endlini yam.
Or now.	Okanye ngoku.
I thought they would go.	Ndandicinga ukuba baza kuya.
But he could not tell after a while.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuxelela emva kwexesha.
I know what's going on, you know.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo, nawe uyazi.
Is that strange?	Ngaba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo?
I hope that will be fun.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kuya kuba mnandi oko.
I will not do it.	Andiyi kuyenza.
But that's what happened here.	Kodwa nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
I told him no.	Ndamxelela ukuba hayi.
But he seldom speaks.	Kodwa akafane athethe.
Then he thought about it.	Emva koko wacinga ngayo.
That will do it.	Oko kuya kuyenza.
With him.	Naye.
There is one thing though.	Kukho into enye nangona kunjalo.
As it is now.	Njengoko kunjalo ngoku.
He made that happen.	Uyenze ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
I wanted someone else to know.	Bendifuna omnye umntu azi.
I hope you will come back.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kubuya.
I don't know if that's a good thing.	Andazi ukuba yinto entle leyo.
Now, he thought.	Ngoku, wacinga.
You're ready to go this afternoon.	Ulungile ukuhamba ngale njikalanga.
Now you know.	Ngoku uyazi.
He took his time with it.	Wathatha ixesha lakhe ngayo.
I can't speak right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha okwangoku.
I did not want to talk.	Ndandingafuni kuthetha.
There is some truth there.	Kukho inyani ethile apho.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange acinge njalo.
It will be the same for everyone.	Kuya kuba njalo wonke umntu.
And this will be.	Kwaye oku kuya kuba.
Days, of course, maybe weeks.	Iintsuku, ngokuqinisekileyo, mhlawumbi iiveki.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
What do you think.	Ucinga ntoni.
He’s here, but, not for long.	Ulapha, kodwa, hayi ixesha elide.
It seemed obvious.	Kwakubonakala kucacile.
It should not happen this way.	Akufanele kwenzeke ngolu hlobo.
So he has to do it.	Ngoko ufanele ayenze.
He does not want to make an image.	Akafuni ukwenza umfanekiso.
Someone is here.	Kukho umntu apha.
He will not come.	Akayi kuza.
Whatever that was, he didn't know.	Inokuba yintoni na loo nto, wayengazi.
He told me why.	Undixelele ukuba kutheni.
We need to make it happen.	Kufuneka siyenze yenzeke.
Not really, though.	Hayi nyani, nangona kunjalo.
And it could be anything.	Kwaye inokuba nantoni na.
They will do anything with money.	Baza kwenza nantoni na ngemali.
You eat a lot.	Utya kakhulu.
How are you doing here?	Uhamba njani apha?
I actually went there.	Nyani ndaya khona.
I want to tell you more.	Ndifuna ukukuxelela ngakumbi.
He too is doing well.	Naye wenza kakuhle.
They said they would do this.	Bathi baya kuyenza le nto.
He lives in me.	Uhlala kum.
I can't say anything about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na ngaloo nto.
I had to look back.	Bekufanele ndijonge ngasemva.
Something about time.	Into malunga nexesha.
That's right, and it will be so.	Kunjalo, kwaye kuya kuba njalo.
So who ?.	Khona ngubani?.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze le nto ufuna ukuyenza.
I don't know where it is now.	Andazi ukuba iphi ngoku.
Maybe it will be you, too.	Mhlawumbi iya kuba nguwe, nawe.
You have to do it that way.	Kufuneka wenze ngolo hlobo.
Now, I am.	Ngoku, ndim.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi kuhlala.
You can't eat anything.	Awukwazi ukutya nantoni na.
I don't know if that's true.	Andazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
We did a good job.	Senze umsebenzi omhle.
I do a lot.	Ndiyenza kakhulu.
What will you do with the money?	Uza kwenza ntoni ngemali?
I want you to come, too.	Ndiya kufuna ukuba uze, nam.
Me too.	Nam ngokwam.
Now you know better.	Ngoku wazi ngcono.
He stepped forward.	Waya phambili.
Tomorrow, we will both be better.	Ngomso, sobabini siya kuba ngcono.
However, this can be difficult to do.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kunokuba nzima ukwenza.
I know him to be my friend.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ngumhlobo wam.
She is doing very well in her job.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu emsebenzini wakhe.
After that, she left the house.	Emva koko, waphuma endlwini.
He fell asleep, he told her.	Uye walala, wamxelela.
I will continue.	Ndiza kuqhubeka.
And how difficult.	Kwaye kunzima kangakanani na.
And he didn't know how he felt.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba uziva njani.
My breakfast.	Isidlo sakusasa sam.
And never.	Kwaye soze.
And man did.	Kwaye umntu wenza.
But in the end.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni.
Please say another.	Ndicela uthethe enye.
Slowly, he began to talk.	Kancinci kancinci, waqalisa ukuthetha.
And it gets even better because.	Kwaye kuba ngcono ngakumbi kuba.
You need more time.	Ufuna ixesha elingakumbi.
No! 	Hayi!
No one knew what death was, or consciousness.	Akukho bani wayesazi ukuba yintoni ukufa, okanye ukwazi.
So he returned to his work.	Ngoko wabuyela emsebenzini wakhe.
Someone made a mistake.	Umntu wenze impazamo.
I think you can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba ungayenza.
Then nothing happened.	Emva koko akuzange kwenzeke nto.
Not so much now.	Hayi kakhulu ngoku.
You go far.	Uya kude.
But it was not too difficult.	Kodwa ke akuzange kube nzima ngakumbi.
Not so much, though, he thought.	Hayi kakhulu, nokuba, wacinga.
Just one thing.	Into nje enye.
You do not want to know why someone is doing something.	Awufuni ukwazi ukuba kutheni umntu enze into.
I’m not sure if it’s ‘okay’, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba 'ilungile' na, nangona kunjalo.
That, however, is not the case.	Oko, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
But the truth is.	Kodwa inyaniso.
Or maybe someone else will talk about it.	Okanye mhlawumbi omnye umntu uya kuthetha ngaye.
I don’t care one way or the other.	Andikhathali ngenye indlela okanye enye.
This is how it happened.	Kwenzeka ngolu hlobo oko.
John is a good friend.	UJohn ngumhlobo olungileyo.
Like me.	Njengam.
But you did well.	Kodwa wenze kakuhle.
I certainly hope not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
I'm not sure about the good stuff.	Andiqinisekanga ngento entle.
So where do you sleep at night?	Khona ulele phi ebusuku?
Everything, and nothing.	Yonke into, kwaye akukho nto.
Thinking about him a lot.	Ukucinga ngaye kakhulu.
Would you like this too ?.	Ngaba nawe ungathanda oku?.
But he would return.	Kodwa wayeza kubuya.
He doesn't have to be.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba abe njalo.
Well done, of course.	Wenze kakuhle, kunjalo.
This is my friend.	Ngumhlobo wam lo.
Your parents will surely do so.	Abazali bakho ngokuqinisekileyo baya kukwenza oko.
But more than that.	Kodwa ngaphezu koko.
My little problem.	Ingxaki yam encinci.
To me it is not so much.	Kum akukho nto ingako kangako.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
There was no need for me to go first.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba ndihambe kuqala.
I wanted him to do that, though.	Ndandifuna ukuba enze njalo, nangona kunjalo.
Something about it.	Into malunga nayo.
You know the whole thing, the whole story.	Uyayazi yonke loo nto, ibali lonke.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Akafuni kuthetha nam.
Almost as he was scared.	Phantse njengoko wayesoyika.
Are you ready to go?	Ngaba ukulungele ukuhamba?
I never really knew.	Andizange ndikwazi ngokwenene.
I'm sure you do too.	Ndiqinisekile uyayenza nawe.
He ran that way.	Wabaleka ngolo hlobo.
Yeah, enough about him.	Ewe, ngokwaneleyo malunga naye.
He works hard all the time.	Usebenza nzima ngalo lonke ixesha.
I did the right thing.	Ndenze into elungileyo.
And not so well.	Kwaye akunjalo kakuhle.
Yeah, that's right, that's right.	Ewe, kunjalo, kunjalo.
But that's okay, he thought.	Kodwa oko kulungile, wacinga.
I'm starting to try another time.	Ndiyaqala ukuzama elinye ixesha.
Just a phone.	Ifowuni nje.
No one wanted to.	Akukho mntu wayefuna.
In the end, he did nothing.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange enze nto.
I want you to be better than me.	Ndifuna ungcono kunam.
And he did things.	Kwaye wenze izinto.
Some he knew, some.	Abanye wayesazi, abanye.
He wanted to know what it was.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
We both know who you are talking about.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba uthetha bani.
His eyes	Amehlo akhe
And every day you want these afterwards.	Kwaye yonke imihla ufuna ezi emva koko.
This job looks great.	Lo msebenzi ukhangeleka kakuhle.
You will see in this.	Uya kubona kule nto.
Helping other people.	Ukunceda abanye abantu.
OK OK.	Kulungile kulungile.
Yes, it is time.	Ewe, lixesha.
I wish he came here.	Ndinqwenela ukuba eze apha.
You have probably done this before.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile le nto ngaphambili.
It would be nice to see that.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukubona oko.
He didn't think he was looking too hard.	Zange acinge ukuba ujonge kakhulu.
I do not know tomorrow.	Andikwazi ngomso.
Your gun.	Umpu wakho.
For today, or.	Kuba namhlanje, okanye.
But it is very difficult to do.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
But this did not happen.	Kodwa oku akuzange kube njalo.
But you have a problem.	Kodwa unengxaki.
I thought it would be like.	Ndacinga ukuba kuya kuba njani.
I look good.	Ndijonge kakuhle.
What will happen to you?	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuwe?
He just doesn't want to.	Akafuni nje.
He thought a little.	Wayecinga kancinci.
Let me tell you a story.	Makhe ndikuxelele ibali.
Above all,	Ngaphezu koko,
There was no one around.	Kwakungekho mntu malunga.
Yes, you drink alcohol for breakfast.	Ewe, utywala ngesidlo sakusasa.
It would be a very good thing.	Iya kuba yinto entle kakhulu.
Just as he is not here.	Kanye njengokuba engekho apha.
I thought he was really serious.	Ndandicinga ukuba uzimisele ngokwenene.
Don't finish.	Musa ukugqiba.
What you really like.	Oko uthanda ngokwenene.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
My mother does not want to talk to me.	Umama akafuni kuthetha nam.
I'm looking at that today.	Ndijonge kuloo nto namhlanje.
Yes, that's my job.	Ewe, ngumsebenzi wam lowo.
That will make it easier for us.	Oko kuya kwenza kube lula kuthi.
You want to see everything out there.	Ufuna ukubona yonke into yakho ngaphandle.
But he did not want to think about it again.	Kodwa wayengafuni kuphinda acinge ngayo.
Thank you for being here for us.	Enkosi ngokuba lapha kuthi.
The cat with him.	Ikati kunye naye.
But it is very difficult to read.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukufunda.
He did everything well.	Wenza yonke into kakuhle.
I know this now.	Ndiyayazi le nto ngoku.
That's not fun.	Akukho mnandi oko.
I don't know what to do.	Andazi ukuba senze ntoni.
Everyone loves it.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda.
That is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko oko.
He needs your help.	Ufuna uncedo lwakho.
A good job like you.	Umsebenzi olungileyo njengawe.
Everyone is talking about him.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngaye.
We will be.	Siya kuba.
But it should not.	Kodwa akufanele.
Go here.	Uhambe uze apha.
I want to be with my friends.	Ndifuna ukuba nabahlobo bam.
But do not overdo it.	Kodwa musa ukuba mde.
He wanted very much.	Wayefuna kakhulu.
Then there is such a thing.	Emva koko kukho into enjalo.
He also wants to get a cat.	Naye ufuna ukufumana ikati.
A good wife like you.	Umfazi olungileyo njengawe.
He would do everything.	Wayeza kwenza yonke into.
I look forward to dinner with him.	Ndijonge phambili kwisidlo sangokuhlwa kunye naye.
There is a truth in you.	Kukho inyani kuwe.
Stop talking! 	Yeka ukuthetha!
And he loves to travel.	Kwaye uthanda ukuhamba.
But that seemed like a long way off.	Kodwa oko kwakubonakala ngathi kuya kuba kude kakhulu.
It seems so.	Kubonakala ngathi kunjalo.
Really very.	Ngokwenene kakhulu.
He was talking about it.	Wayethetha ngayo.
Yes thank you .	Ewe Enkosi .
I only did the work.	Ndenze umsebenzi kuphela.
I know you want children.	Ndiyayazi ufuna abantwana.
I want you to know something.	Ndifuna wazi into.
I'm a little scared of it.	Ndiyoyika kancinci ngayo.
Yes to all of that.	Ewe kuyo yonke loo nto.
It seems like everyone.	Kubonakala ngathi wonke umntu.
I just want to run a business.	Ndifuna nje ukuqhuba umsebenzi.
He meant that.	Wayethetha ukuba.
It happens every day now.	Kwenzeka yonke imihla ngoku.
So what are you waiting for ?.	Khona ulindele ntoni?.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Wayesazi ukuba akanakuyenza loo nto.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Uqinisekile ukuba ufuna ukwenza oku?
And he never was.	Kwaye akazange abe njalo.
He wanted to leave immediately.	Wayefuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
He would arrive on time.	Wayeza kufika ngexesha.
So, what happens next.	Ngoko ke, kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
I have to have it.	Kufuneka ndibe nayo.
They sit in the back.	Bahlala ngasemva.
Yes, you will see.	Ewe, uya kubona.
I am going to town.	Ndiya edolophini.
Well, that's what it is.	Ke, yiloo nto ke.
He spent two days in bed.	Wachitha iintsuku ezimbini ebhedini.
I want you to do something.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze into.
He died just as he had hoped.	Wafa kanye njengoko wayefuna.
And I'm happy.	Kwaye ndiyavuya.
I'm here with you.	Ndilapha nawe.
Probably just mom.	Mhlawumbi umama kuphela.
He obviously wanted to get out of there.	Ngokucacileyo wayefuna ukuphuma apho.
But later he left.	Kodwa kamva wahamba.
If there is, you can have it.	Ukuba kukho, unokuba nayo.
But that is not possible out here.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka ngaphandle apha.
And there is absolutely no place.	Kwaye akukho ndawo ngokupheleleyo.
I talked to him in the morning.	Ndithethe naye ekuseni.
Lots of driving.	Ukuqhuba okuninzi.
But he didn't, he couldn't.	Kodwa akazange, akazange akwazi.
And so did you.	Kwaye nawe wenza njalo.
If you want to try it, fine.	Ukuba ufuna ukuzama, kulungile.
He looks strange.	Ubonakala engaqhelekanga.
He came alone.	Weza yedwa.
I am very sure.	Ndiqinisekile kakhulu.
But not each other.	Kodwa hayi omnye komnye.
Probably impossible.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka.
We need to do something, and fast!	Kufuneka senze into, kwaye ngokukhawuleza!
Cars	Imoto
Someone will come.	Umntu uza kuza.
I don't know if there is a problem unless everyone tells him.	Andazi ukuba kukho ingxaki ngaphandle kokuba wonke umntu umxelele.
I never saw him again.	Zange ndiphinde ndimbone.
He will not say no to me.	Akayi kuthi hayi kum.
Very really.	Kakhulu ngokwenene.
He started.	Waqalisa.
No one deserves it.	Akukho mntu ufanele.
Now is your time.	Ngoku lixesha lakho.
He can be with you this afternoon.	Unokuba nawe emva kwemini ngale njikalanga.
Let me do it.	Makhe ndiyenze.
Now this question.	Ngoku lo mbuzo.
He never thought he would have it himself.	Akazange acinge ukuba uya kuba nayo ngokwakhe.
Of course no one is going to do this.	Ewe akukho mntu uza kuyenza le nto.
And for now, that's fine.	Kwaye okwangoku, kulungile.
I knew he would do that.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuyenza loo nto.
I can't tell you much.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela okuninzi.
Maybe not too soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala nje.
I don't remember much about that.	Andikhumbuli kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I'm looking at this.	Ndijonge oku.
It has to happen fast.	Kufuneka kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want you to leave.	Andifuni uhambe.
What a strange woman.	Yintoni engaqhelekanga umfazi.
Or maybe yes, but not for you.	Okanye mhlawumbi ewe, kodwa hayi kuwe.
That is good for me.	Oko kulungile kum.
I wondered what the problem was.	Ndandicinga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
But no one does everything.	Kodwa akukho mntu wenza yonke into.
You want the best person for the job.	Ufuna umntu ongcono kakhulu emsebenzini.
A strange place.	Indawo engaqhelekanga.
Now that he is here, however, he will not leave.	Ngoku elapha, nangona kunjalo, akasayi kuhamba.
Can you do it.	Ngaba uyakwazi ukwenza.
And maybe a lot more.	Kwaye mhlawumbi okuninzi ngakumbi.
And of course, together.	Kwaye kunjalo, kunye.
He took another one and went with him.	Wathatha omnye wahamba naye.
He tried that morning.	Wazama ngaloo ntsasa.
He told me he was tired.	Wandixelela ukuba udiniwe.
You have reached a new place.	Ufike kwindawo entsha.
So you won't be in that. 	Ngoko akuyi kuba kuloo nto. 
Take a good look, before you go home.	Jonga kakuhle, ngaphambi kokuba uhambe ekhaya.
He wanted me to stay.	Wayefuna ndihlale.
You want to take your time.	Ufuna ukuthatha ixesha lakho.
He really is.	Unjalo ngokwenene.
But some people.	Kodwa abanye abantu.
It's our time again.	Lixesha lethu kwakhona.
How you study in college.	Ufunda njani ekholejini.
I hope everything is fine with you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yonke into ilungile kuwe.
Mary didn't say much.	UMarry akazange athethe kakhulu.
She likes my coffee.	Uyayithanda ikofu yam.
But he is not.	Kodwa akakho.
Again a little bit.	Kwakhona kancinci.
Unless it was.	Ngaphandle kokuba kwakungekho.
I have never made one so big before.	Andizange ndenze enye enkulu kangaka ngaphambili.
And he knew.	Kwaye wayesazi.
I know you want to go to work.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuya emsebenzini.
But no, it's not.	Kodwa hayi, akunjalo.
It would take time.	Bekuya kuthatha ixesha.
I don't know why, exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kanye.
I doubt it will be anything good.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba iya kuba nantoni na elungileyo.
The other two.	Ezinye ezimbini.
But he asked to see the children.	Kodwa wacela ukubona abantwana.
Everyone wants to know about it.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukwazi ngayo.
I think it was never done.	Ndicinga ukuba ayizange yenziwe.
If there is only one thing, you do not have to do anything.	Xa kukho into enye kuphela, akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze nantoni na.
He came in after a long time.	Wangena emva kwexesha elide.
Now then, tell me.	Ngoku ke, ndixelele.
Good opportunity.	Ithuba elihle.
He looked alone.	Wayekhangeleka eyedwa.
Her mother did everything she could to help her.	Umama wakhe wenza konke okusemandleni ukuze amncede.
This requires two things.	Oku kufuna izinto ezimbini.
I speak really forward and very often.	Ndithetha phambili ngokwenene kwaye rhoqo kakhulu.
Really.	Ngokwenene.
You have to stay in it every day.	Kufuneka uhlale kuyo yonke imihla.
And thank you so much for being with me.	Kwaye enkosi kakhulu ngokuba nam.
We did it last night.	Senze phezolo.
There is someone there who would like to talk to you.	Kukho umntu apho angathanda ukuthetha nawe.
Don't just stop playing.	Musa nje ukuyeka ukudlala.
He wants forgiveness.	Ufuna uxolo.
I know he knew.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayesazi.
Well, of course, it's very good.	Ewe, kunjalo, kuhle kakhulu.
I know that well enough.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokwaneleyo.
He spoke to her kindly.	Wathetha naye kakuhle.
Well, not mom, obviously.	Ewe, hayi umama, ngokucacileyo.
Let me learn more about that.	Makhe ndifunde ngakumbi ngaloo nto.
You will find someone new.	Uya kufumana umntu omtsha.
And not in the right way.	Kwaye hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
Not you, obviously.	Hayi wena, ngokucacileyo.
Obviously it would.	Ngokucacileyo bekuya kuba njalo.
I will not be angry.	Andiyi kuba nomsindo.
He says he won't go.	Uthi akayi kuhamba.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Okanye nabani na, ngaloo nto.
Then we will start now.	Emva koko siza kuqala ngoku.
Outside, this time, it was not.	Ngaphandle, ngeli xesha, kwakungekho.
Because he is.	Ngokuba unjalo.
But later.	Kodwa kamva.
And to think of him more.	Kwaye ukucinga ngaye ngakumbi.
He immediately got started.	Ngokukhawuleza waqalisa.
For coming soon.	Ngokuba ukuza ngaphambili.
I thought you might like it.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda.
He did not just walk away.	Akazange ahambe kuphela.
He went to town.	Uye edolophini.
He has to think about her.	Kufuneka acinge ngaye.
You know, people are moving forward.	Uyazi, abantu baya phambili.
Moreover, that before.	Ngaphezu koko, oko ngaphambili.
I had to make this happen.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze le nto yenzeke.
And no one came to see it.	Kwaye akukho mntu uze kubona.
And a lot of people.	Kwaye abantu abaninzi.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
In the meantime, and if we have to.	Okwangoku, kwaye ukuba kufuneka senze.
Now he went into the room.	Ngoku wangena egumbini.
I can't wait any longer.	Andikwazi ukulinda ngakumbi.
No one likes a good person at all.	Akukho mntu uthanda umntu olungileyo kuyo yonke into.
However this does not seem to be the case.	Nangona kunjalo oku kubonakala ukuba akunjalo.
You need to talk to me.	Kufuneka uthethe nam.
He did not want his money.	Wayengafuni mali yakhe.
Just like everyone else.	Kanye njengokuba wonke umntu.
I don’t have it and I don’t.	Andinayo kwaye andiyi.
I went easy on you.	Ndihambe lula kuwe.
Everything.	Yonke into .
Have you ever been there?	Ngaba ukhe waya apho?
There must be something wrong, something bad.	Kumele ukuba kukho into embi, into embi.
So everyone asked him for advice.	Ngoko wonke umntu wacela icebiso kuye.
Not before, and not after.	Hayi ngaphambili, kwaye hayi emva.
He wanted to be with us.	Wayefuna ukuba nathi.
He will have to learn more about it.	Kuya kufuneka afunde ngakumbi ngayo.
Now, there is another way.	Ngoku, kukho enye indlela.
So I did it this way.	Ngoko ndenza le ndlela.
Or not alone.	Okanye hayi wedwa.
Thank you for being there for her.	Enkosi ngokuba lapho ngenxa yakhe.
He will not be clearly angry.	Akayi kuba nomsindo ngokucacileyo.
It is not easy before.	Akukho lula ngaphambili.
Time again you have realized.	Ixesha kwakhona uye waqonda.
Maybe, but not soon.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi kungekudala.
And he is here.	Kwaye ulapha.
Otherwise, an error will occur.	Ngaphandle koko, impazamo iya kwenzeka.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
As it will happen.	Njengokuba iza kwenzeka.
Nothing of ours there.	Akukho nto yethu apho.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Sorry, but.	Uxolo, kodwa .
So, although he was afraid, he agreed.	Ngoko, nangona wayesoyika, wavuma.
He will never speak to you again.	Soze aphinde athethe nawe.
I wanted to get out of there.	Ndandifuna ukuphuma apho.
That's what he's going to do.	Yiyo loo nto eza kuyenza.
And now there is no food in the house.	Kwaye ngoku akukho kutya endlini.
In the case.	Ecaleni.
He lives far away.	Uhlala kude.
So it will be seen at first.	Ngoko kuya kubonakala ekuqaleni.
Not enough.	Akukho ngokwaneleyo.
If he ever did.	Ukuba ukhe enze njalo.
He agreed with me.	Wavuma nam.
You know you will.	Uyazi uya kwenza.
He looked around his room.	Wajonga egumbini lakhe.
Someone or something.	Umntu okanye into leyo.
I want to work on it.	Ndifuna ukusebenza kuyo.
This is my first visit here.	Ndiyaqala ukuza apha.
And many more out there for sure.	Kwaye abaninzi ngakumbi ngaphandle apho ngokuqinisekileyo.
A little talk.	Intetho encinci.
But we will.	Kodwa siza kwenza njalo.
There is a cat in my bedroom!	Kukho ikati kwigumbi lam lokulala!
Why do you want that.	Kutheni ufuna lonto.
The music is perfectly fine.	Umculo ulungile ngokupheleleyo.
This can be very difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Do not come to him.	Musa ukuza kuye.
Next to him.	Ecaleni kwakhe.
I went at night.	Ndiye ebusuku.
He knows exactly what to do.	Uyazi kakuhle into amakayenze.
That's not it.	Asiyonto leyo.
Look there!	Jonga phaya!
He thought of going for help.	Wacinga ukuya kufuna uncedo.
Today, you are lucky.	Namhlanje, unethamsanqa.
I just knew it would happen one day.	Ndandisazi nje ukuba iya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
Which one.	Yeyiphi leyo.
He wanted very much for a long time.	Wayefuna kakhulu ixesha elide.
No one wanted to play.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukudlala.
Or bad for you.	Okanye kakubi kuwe.
He didn't know if he could do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza na loo nto.
Almost there, now.	Phantse phaya, ngoku.
He died later that evening.	Wafa kamva ngaloo ngokuhlwa.
It will be late.	Uzakuba late.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
He heard only his voice.	Weva ilizwi lakhe kuphela.
Something is definitely wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga ngokuqinisekileyo.
But you have thought about it.	Kodwa uye wacinga ngayo.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa ke akuzange kube njalo.
I did it again.	Ndiyenzile kwakhona.
I do the same for you.	Ndenza njalo kuwe.
Well, you know that.	Ewe, uyayazi loo nto.
Three years in the making.	Iminyaka emithathu ekwenzeni.
I want you to stay here with me.	Ndifuna uhlala apha nam.
I don't think it will take long.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuthatha ixesha elide.
I look at my mother.	Ndijonge umama.
It's made that way.	Yenziwe ngolo hlobo.
Her mother never told her she loved her.	Umama wakhe akazange amxelele ukuba uyamthanda.
Not for you and me.	Hayi kuwe nawe.
This time tomorrow, you will know.	Ngeli xesha ngomso, uya kukwazi.
He is my only friend.	Ngumhlobo wam kuphela.
I hope you will be back soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kubuya kungekudala.
No problem has occurred.	Akukho ngxaki yenzekileyo.
You have to do it this way.	Kufuneka wenze ngale ndlela.
I think that's him.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye lowo.
She ran away from him.	Wabaleka wemka kuye.
And this is another thing, too.	Kwaye le enye into, nayo.
Eating breakfast.	Ukutya isidlo sakusasa.
However, this should not be the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akufanele kube njalo.
I never read.	Andizange ndifunde.
Besides that.	Ngaphandle koko.
Maybe you will start here.	Mhlawumbi uza kuqala apha.
However, you should do it right away.	Nangona kunjalo, kufuneka uyenze kwangoko.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And there is something else.	Kwaye kukho enye into.
Who better to die with.	Ngubani ongcono ukufa naye.
I thought you were lucky.	Ndandicinga ukuba unethamsanqa.
The picture seems to be moving.	Umfanekiso ubonakala uhamba.
No one was really talking about it.	Akukho mntu wayethetha ngayo ngokwenene.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
No one will ever know about this.	Akukho mntu uya kuze azi ngale nto.
After that, she felt better.	Emva koko, waziva engcono.
You have to leave right away.	Kufuneka uhambe kwangoko.
Finding time !.	Ukufumana ixesha!.
He looked at this one.	Wajonga lo.
No one is going to do it.	Akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
I doubt anyone will do it.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba nabani na uya kuyenza.
Wrong way.	Indlela engalunganga.
Something very strange.	Into engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
Right now he wanted his time.	Kanye ngoku wayefuna ixesha lakhe.
He had done this once before.	Wakhe wakwenza oku kanye ngaphambili.
He can't finish.	Akakwazi ukugqiba.
She can't meet him more than once.	Akakwazi ukudibana naye ngaphezu kwexesha elinye.
Work is time.	Umsebenzi lixesha.
I had to talk to him.	Kwafuneka ndithethe naye.
He stayed a long time.	Wahlala ixesha elide.
But he was already very strange.	Kodwa wayesele engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
Looking for a better job.	Ujonge umsebenzi ongcono.
I need to learn more.	Kufuneka ndifunde ngakumbi.
He wanted to die himself.	Wayefuna ukufa ngokwakhe.
All right, tomorrow morning.	Kulungile, ngomso kusasa.
I would like to work outside.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza ngaphandle.
This was not for him.	Oku kwakungekho kuye.
At first you will earn a lot of money.	Ekuqaleni uya kufumana imali eninzi.
He did it alone.	Uyenze wedwa.
No one came forward.	Akukho mntu weza ngaphambili.
I don't see anyone here.	Andiboni mntu apha.
I hope to see some of you there !.	Ndiyathemba ukubona abanye bakho apho!.
Everyone knew about it.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngayo.
And it's not hard to see that.	Kwaye akukho nzima ukubona ukuba kunjalo.
I don't know who he is at first.	Andazi ukuba nguye ekuqaleni.
Tell the woman it's you.	Ndixelele umfazi ukuba nguwe.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto elungileyo.
Maybe you too.	Mhlawumbi nawe.
And now he was gone.	Kwaye ngoku wayengekho.
I'm scared of it.	Ndiyoyika ngayo.
I know everything.	Ndikwazi yonke into.
I came to talk about myself here.	Ndize kuthetha ngam apha.
This time, he speaks.	Ngeli xesha, uthetha.
He came to live with us.	Weza kuhlala nathi.
You need a doctor.	Ufuna ugqirha.
But you might be right about this.	Kodwa unokuba ulungile ngale nto.
But until then.	Kodwa kude kube ngoko.
Not exactly, of course.	Hayi kanye, kunjalo.
I will be human.	Ndiya kuba ngumntu.
That's how everyone is.	Unjalo wonke umntu.
One day, he just walked away.	Ngenye imini, wahamba nje.
Certainly there is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho.
They live in the city.	Bahlala edolophini.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
And it's all up to me.	Kwaye konke kum.
You know it too.	Nawe uyayazi.
We do not have to do this work.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze lo msebenzi.
A few years late, but okay.	Iminyaka embalwa emva kwexesha, kodwa ilungile.
And now he is here again.	Kwaye ngoku ulapha kwakhona.
I never did that.	Zange ndiyenze lonto.
Just my take on it.	Ukuthatha kwam nje kuyo.
I am very happy about it.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ngayo.
His mother left.	Umama wakhe wahamba.
I can say it.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyithetha.
Thank you for that.	Enkosi kunjalo.
Then he came.	Emva koko weza.
I want to do the right thing.	Ndifuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
He did a very good job.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
He did it this morning.	Uyenzile ngale ntsasa.
In the meantime, you can get better.	Ngeli xesha, unokuba ngcono.
If you have ever seen someone again.	Ukuba ukhe wabona umntu kwakhona.
So he came to live here.	Ngoko weza kuhlala apha.
I never thought of anything else.	Andizange ndicinge enye into.
Then he entered the classroom.	Emva koko wangena eklasini.
You don't have to talk about me.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe ngam.
Or he said he did.	Okanye uthe wenza njalo.
And now, he knew more.	Kwaye ngoku, wayesazi ngakumbi.
Don't go ahead, no one likes a woman up front.	Musa ukuba phambili, akukho mntu uthanda umfazi phambili.
Unless we did not.	Ngaphandle kokuba asizange.
I did it clearly.	Ndenze ngokucacileyo.
At night, the music grew louder.	Ebusuku, umculo waba phezulu.
But it can be very difficult.	Kodwa kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Not your doctor.	Hayi ugqirha wakho.
What happened tonight.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngokuhlwanje.
All or nothing and then everything again.	Konke okanye akukho nto kwaye emva koko yonke into kwakhona.
It seems impossible right now.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka okwangoku.
Waiting.	Ukulinda.
I can think.	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga.
This is now about me and you.	Oku ngoku malunga nam nawe.
I don't want to do anything about it.	Andifuni kwenza nto ngayo.
More than you think.	Ngaphezu kokuba ucinga.
He stayed there all day.	Wahlala khona imini yonke.
But please.	Kodwa nceda.
He got out of there.	Waphuma apho.
She arrived at the hospital.	Wafika esibhedlele.
It will take time to get there.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha ukufika apho.
I don't remember much.	Andikhumbuli kangako.
I'll do one or two.	Ndiza kwenza enye okanye ezimbini.
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into.
It’s better to get more people, more space, in front of him.	Kungcono ukufumana abantu abaninzi, indawo eninzi, phambi kwakhe.
He is talking about us.	Uthetha ngathi.
Everyone just stared.	Wonke umntu wajonga nje.
There is not much to do, but something.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza, kodwa into.
He said he needed my help.	Uthe ufuna uncedo lwam.
So do you.	Ngoko ke wena.
Soon, very quickly.	Kungekudala, ngokukhawuleza.
Everyone felt it.	Wonke umntu waziva.
Finally he left the house.	Ekugqibeleni waphuma endlwini.
But the problem is that this will be true of any answer.	Kodwa ingxaki kukuba oku kuya kuba yinyani kuyo nayiphi na impendulo.
But he says a few things.	Kodwa uthetha izinto ezimbalwa.
He got a job.	Wafumana umsebenzi.
Nobody did.	Akukho mntu wenza.
i don't like it.	andiyithandi.
Thank you for being you.	Enkosi ngokuba nguwe.
It seemed like he was going to speak.	Kwakubonakala ngathi uza kuthetha.
Help me please.	Ndincede Nceda.
Okay and okay, then.	Kulungile kwaye kulungile, ngoko.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
I think so .	Ndicinga njalo .
His wife was away.	Umfazi wakhe wayengekho.
I am very tired.	Ndidiniwe kakhulu.
This time it took longer.	Ngeli xesha wathatha ixesha elide ngakumbi.
He said he was not there.	Wathi wayengekho.
But not here, not now.	Kodwa hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
He is asleep.	Ulele.
But you do not need my help.	Kodwa awufuni uncedo lwam.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuzange kube njalo.
It was not as if he did not know himself.	Kwakungekho ngathi akayazi ngokwakhe.
I could not say anything.	Andikwazanga ukuthetha nto.
My mother never got better.	Umama akazange abe ngcono.
Now you can do that.	Ngoku ungayenza loo nto.
Not otherwise !!!.	Hayi ngenye indlela !!!.
But first you have to get there.	Kodwa kuqala kufuneka ufike apho.
And he made his life.	Kwaye wenza ubomi bakhe.
Or go here.	Okanye ukuhamba apha.
Everyone tries to get it every day.	Wonke umntu uzama ukufumana yonke imihla.
You do not have to do anything!	Akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze into!
You too.	Nawe nam.
I don't think he knew that.	Andiqondi ukuba wayesazi kunjalo.
But not in such an unusual way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela engaqhelekanga ngolu hlobo.
But not far from this time.	Kodwa hayi kude ngeli xesha.
He became a good friend.	Waba ngumhlobo olungileyo.
Did you do the right thing? 	Ngaba wenze into elungileyo?
I don't know what you think.	Andazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
She tried to talk to him but he left.	Wazama ukuthetha naye kodwa wahamba.
One thing, really.	Into enye, ngenene.
For hours, he thought.	Iiyure, wacinga.
I will make dinner.	Ndiza kwenza isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Do not make this difficult.	Musa ukuyenza nzima le nto.
I thought about this all day long.	Bendicinga ngale nto imini yonke.
A woman, too.	Umfazi, naye.
I was thinking about you yesterday.	Bendicinga ngawe izolo.
Right in front of you.	Kanye phambi kwakho.
Not really my thing.	Hayi nyani into yam.
Swimming to the top is always difficult, but not impossible.	Ukuqubha ukuya phezulu kuhlala kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I can't stay home today.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ekhaya namhlanje.
It is real and you know it.	Yinyani kwaye uyayazi.
I'm not sure how much we'll see.	Andazi ncam ukuba siza kubona kangakanani.
I love your feedback.	Ndiyayithanda impendulo yakho.
But this is not the case now.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngoku.
Or even better.	Okanye ngcono ngakumbi.
Not too long now.	Hayi ixesha elide ngoku.
Not yet, of course.	Hayi okwangoku, kunjalo.
You may already know.	Usenokuba sele eza kukwazi.
It seemed a long time ago.	Kwakubonakala kudala kakhulu.
Taking over.	Ukuthatha indawo.
I'm not really here.	Andikho nyani apha.
I did not say that.	Khange ndithethe ngendlela.
I will be ahead.	Ndiza kuba ngaphambili.
And that goes well.	Ke oko kuhamba kakuhle.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
Some have gone up, some down.	Abanye baye phezulu, abanye baye phantsi.
I don't want to be that way.	Andifuni ukuba njalo.
He did not speak on his own.	Zange athethe yedwa.
That's right though.	Ilungile loo nto kunjalo.
We just want to do the right thing.	Sifuna nje ukwenza into elungileyo.
It could be anything else.	Inokuba yintoni enye.
I would like to talk about your new job.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngomsebenzi wakho omtsha.
It seemed a long time ago.	Kwakubonakala kudala.
Well, maybe not at all.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi ngokupheleleyo.
And he needed my help.	Kwaye wayefuna uncedo lwam.
Not so with us.	Akunjalo nathi kuphela.
There is nothing he would like better.	Akukho nto angathanda ngcono.
There is no reason for me to do it again.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ndiphinde.
If you feel that way.	Ukuba uziva njalo.
It's just the truth.	Yinto nje inyaniso.
We need to do something about it.	Kufuneka senze into ngaloo nto.
Is a big problem now.	Ngaba ingxaki enkulu ngoku.
Either way, he needs your help.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, ufuna uncedo lwakho.
That's all right.	Yinyani yonke loo nto.
Other than that, he did nothing.	Ngaphandle koko, akenzanga nto.
If not, you can do it.	Ukuba akukho, ungayenza.
It was not fun for me.	Kwakungekho mnandi kum.
Life now.	Ubomi ngoku.
You should not do this.	Akufanele uyenze le nto.
Yes you are interested.	Ewe unomdla.
You may have gone too fast by then.	Inokuba uye wahamba ngokukhawuleza ngoko.
But something must have happened.	Kodwa kumele ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
I know everyone is busy.	Ndiyazi wonke umntu uxakekile.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
You do not know how you got there.	Awuyazi ukuba ufike njani apho.
However, this is not the case.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo.
But this is not the case here.	Kodwa oku akunjalo apha.
He goes the wrong way no matter what happens.	Uhamba ngendlela embi nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
I'm sure it will be so.	Ndiqinisekile iya kuba njalo.
No one, really.	Akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
Not long ago, not now, not later.	Akukho kudala, akukho ngoku, akukho kamva.
Not when he came so far.	Hayi xa eze kude kangaka.
I learned a lot there.	Ndifunde okuninzi apho.
Yes, I really like it.	Ewe, ndiyayithanda ngokwenene.
You have to talk to me about it.	Kufuneka uthethe nam ngayo.
To do that.	Ukwenza oko.
He looked away quickly.	Wajonga kude ngokukhawuleza.
Then this, then.	Emva koko oku, emva koko.
He never did.	Akazange enjenjalo.
About too long.	Malunga nexesha elide kakhulu.
That's what it is.	Yiyo ke le nto.
I tried to imagine what that could be.	Ndazama ukucinga ukuba inokuba njani loo nto.
Then you told me.	Emva koko undixelele.
What, he did not know.	Yintoni, wayengazi.
Day or night.	Imini okanye ubusuku.
True, it is true.	Yinyani, yinyani.
We will do as little as possible.	Siza kwenza kancinci kangangoko.
And he is my friend.	Kwaye ngumhlobo wam.
I was.	Ndive .
Especially without time.	Ngakumbi ngaphandle kwexesha.
In the city somewhere.	Edolophini kwindawo ethile.
After that she didn't talk much to him.	Emva koko akazange athethe kakhulu naye.
So, he went first.	Ngoko, waya kuqala.
Maybe better than, you know, anyone who has done it before.	Mhlawumbi ngcono kunokuba, uyazi, nabani na wenze ngaphambili.
I saw a lot not a lot.	Ndibone kakhulu hayi kakhulu.
After a while, he looked up.	Emva kwexesha, wajonga phezulu.
And still very much so.	Kwaye nangoku kakhulu.
He studied for three hours.	Wafunda iiyure ezintathu.
I do not want to be late.	Andifuni ukuba mva.
I felt good.	Ndive kakuhle.
I don't like it here.	Andiyithandi apha.
No one has ever asked me that before.	Akukho mntu wakha wandibuza oko ngaphambili.
His call, whatever it is.	Umnxeba wakhe, nokuba yintoni na.
And yes, it's true.	Kwaye ewe, yinyani.
If so, then yes.	Xa kunjalo, ke ewe.
And he does not know how long it will last.	Kwaye akazi ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
He said, it is you.	Wathi, nguwe.
He never told me.	Akazange andixelele.
This you need to know.	Oku kufuneka ukwazi.
There is simply no way.	Akukho ndlela nje.
Is something wrong, doctor?	Ngaba kukho into engalunganga, ugqirha?
This time, he is.	Ngeli xesha, nguye.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Ngubani kwaye phi, njani kwaye kutheni, nini kwaye yintoni.
Tom knew he expected her to say something.	UTom wayesazi ukuba ulindele ukuba athethe into.
He ate everything.	Watya yonke into.
Not knowing what to do he came to our room.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni uye weza egumbini lethu.
This is exactly what he wants to do with it.	Yile nto kanye afuna ukuyenza ngayo.
And a place to stay.	Kwaye indawo yokuhlala.
Not all night, of course.	Hayi ubusuku bonke, kunjalo.
He has been gone for a very long time.	Uye wahamba ixesha elide kakhulu.
I'll get one soon.	Ndiza kufumana enye kungekudala.
Or maybe it didn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi ayizange.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
It will be back tomorrow afternoon.	Iza kubuya emva kwemini ngomso.
However something even bigger is happening.	Nangona kunjalo kukho into enkulu ngakumbi eyenzekayo.
I like dogs.	Ndiyayithanda inja.
But maybe this is me.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ndim lo.
Where you want to be.	Apho ufuna ukuba khona.
Just then.	Kanye ngelo xesha.
Then something happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka into.
Everyone ran away.	Wonke umntu wabaleka.
You can't be.	Awukwazi ukuba .
He started talking to me.	Waqalisa ukuthetha nam.
He fled from the police.	Wabaleka amapolisa.
I know right.	Ndiyayazi kulungile.
So, it's true.	Ngoko, yinyani.
Why is he doing this?	Kutheni esenza le nto nje?
And he thought he would tell her.	Kwaye wayecinga ukuba uya kumxelela.
I have to say something.	Kufuneka ndithethe into.
This is my doing.	Oku kukwenza kwam.
We will go up.	Siza kuya phezulu.
Clearly it should not be.	Kucacile ukuba akufanele kube khona.
They live up here.	Bahlala apha phezulu.
Do not have children.	Musa ukuba nabantwana.
Are you sure?.	Ingaba uqinisekile?.
What do you want from us?	Ufuna ntoni kuthi?
She has made up her mind.	Uye wathatha isigqibo.
I hope that means both.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kuthetha ukuba bobabini.
I really want to do this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwenza oku.
You just can't do it.	Awunako ukwenza nje.
Then nothing happens for a long time.	Emva koko akukho nto eyenzekayo ixesha elide.
And he went on.	Kwaye waqhubeka.
Would he ever appear to her again? 	Ngaba wayeza kuphinda abonakale kuye?
Everyone in town.	Bonke abantu edolophini.
I can't wait to see what it is.	Andikwazi kulinda ukubona ukuba yintoni.
I really like this one.	Ndiyayithanda le nto kakhulu.
So he will not go away.	Ngoko akayi kuhamba.
Not really about that.	Akunjalo ngenene malunga naloo nto.
Very good question.	Umbuzo omhle kakhulu.
You think badly.	Ucinga kakubi.
Or so everyone thought.	Okanye ke wonke umntu wayecinga.
I am going to college.	Ndiya ekholejini.
This is our job.	Ngumsebenzi wethu lo.
But not bad.	Kodwa hayi kakubi.
I just want you to go.	Ndifuna nje uhambe.
I want you and me.	Ndifuna wena kunye nam.
You did.	Wenze.
It should not be until tomorrow.	Akufunekanga kude kube ngomso.
This is how you feel.	Yile nto uziva ngayo.
It takes many years to learn to speak.	Kuthatha iminyaka emininzi ukufunda ukuthetha.
She has run out.	Uye wabaleka waphuma.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
But one thing.	Kodwa into enye.
We will know where we are going and why.	Siza kukwazi apho siya khona kwaye kutheni.
I have decided.	Ndiye ndagqiba.
I hope it is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani.
Maybe look there.	Mhlawumbi jonga phaya.
I know you did.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenze njalo.
But the phone first.	Kodwa ifowuni kuqala.
Tell me who did this.	Ndixelele ukuba ngubani owenze lento.
He did not want to take it with him.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba nayo ngemali.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange akwazi.
Not far now.	Akukho kude ngoku.
It could be just one or the other.	Inokuba kuphela enye okanye enye.
And you know it, too.	Kwaye uyayazi, naye.
We go to school tomorrow.	Siya esikolweni kusasa.
That certainly is not the case.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
At least.	Kungcono.
She is lucky to have so many friends.	Unethamsanqa lokuba nabahlobo abaninzi.
Just a little talk.	Intetho encinci nje.
He does not have to talk to you every day.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba athethe nawe yonke imihla.
He did not seem to.	Wayengabonakali ukuba.
I need more time.	Ndifuna ixesha elingakumbi.
This is the time when you know.	Ngeli xesha apho uyazi.
I did too.	Nam ndiyenzile.
This, of course, is not the case here.	Oku, kunjalo, akunjalo apha.
I wonder why.	Ingaba kutheni.
Then he ran downstairs himself.	Emva koko wabaleka wehla ngokwakhe.
I'm trying to find a house.	Ndizama ukufumana indlu.
I thought it was just me.	Bendicinga ukuba ndim nje.
And if it is not, it is not.	Kwaye ukuba akunjalo, akunjalo.
Don't wait any longer.	Musa ukulinda kwakhona.
He walked next to her.	Wahamba ecaleni kwakhe.
Me, too.	Nam, ngokwenene.
Picture.	Umfanekiso.
You will come to me.	Uya kuza kum.
I could not stop waiting.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukulinda.
He never said that, but.	Akazange athethe loo nto kanye, kodwa.
I could not find a way to do this.	Andizange ndikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza oku.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
Some children.	Abanye abantwana .
He wants the ball.	Ufuna ibhola.
So why.	Ngoko kutheni.
How he slept.	Walala kangakanani.
Work, work.	Umsebenzi, umsebenzi.
I decided to try some of my time.	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndenze ezinye izinto ngexesha lam.
But to do more.	Kodwa ukwenza okuninzi.
I don't know how you know, but you know.	Andazi ukuba wazi njani, kodwa uyazi.
He wants to be a doctor one day.	Ufuna ukuba ngugqirha ngenye imini.
You have to tell me the truth.	Kufuneka undixelele inyani.
I really wonder this.	Ndiyazibuza ngokwenene oku.
But one small thing.	Kodwa enye into encinci.
I went to school.	Ndiye ndaya esikolweni.
Maybe it's your friend.	Mhlawumbi ngumhlobo wakho.
I'm trying to say something more.	Ndizama ukuthetha enye into ngakumbi.
Please, please stay with me.	Nceda, ndicela uhlale nam.
You want a bad one.	Ufuna enye embi.
This is exactly what is happening now.	Yile nto kanye eyenzekayo ngoku.
I said nothing the other way around.	Khange ndithethe nto ngenye indlela.
I know that is possible.	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
Food comes quickly.	Ukutya kuza ngokukhawuleza.
I think we did very well with that.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
You want to play.	Ufuna ukudlala.
So, if you want to go, you have to do it first.	Ngoko ke, ukuba ufuna ukuhamba kufuneka wenze oko kuqala.
Of course, this is good enough.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
And maybe it's hard.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kunzima.
Okay, though.	Kulungile, nangona kunjalo.
I tried but.	Ndazama kodwa.
There you have everything, but, nothing.	Apho unayo yonke into, kodwa, akukho nto.
He missed the whole meeting.	Walala yonke intlanganiso.
That's all he wants.	Yiloo nto kuphela ayifunayo.
Was he really talking about her?	Ngaba ngokwenene wayethetha ngaye?
Beautiful new house.	Indlu entle entsha.
He wanted to run things his own way.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba izinto ngendlela yakhe.
I looked down and saw.	Ndijonge phantsi ndibone.
You don’t know that, though.	Awuyazi loo nto, nangona kunjalo.
It is clear how you feel.	Kucacile ukuba uziva njani.
Or maybe it is.	Okanye mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Everyone was talking to us.	Wonke umntu wayethetha nathi.
Is it okay for you.	Ngaba kulungile ukuba wena .
Something very unusual happened.	Kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
Is, of course.	Ngaba, kunjalo.
I heard about it.	Ndeva ngayo.
Good job!	Mhle umsebenzi!
I wanted to get out.	Bendifuna ukuphuma.
Everyone, except me.	Wonke umntu, ngaphandle kwam.
You will have to wait as long as you need.	Uya kulinda ixesha elide njengoko kufuneka.
Or have it.	Okanye ube nayo.
Both of them, he thought.	Bobabini, wayecinga.
He stays home all the time.	Uhlala ekhaya ngalo lonke ixesha.
We will go the way.	Siza kuhamba ngendlela.
He decided to do what he had done.	Wagqiba ekubeni enze le nto ayenzileyo.
So let me do that.	Ngoko ke mandiyenze loo nto.
That could be up.	Oko kunokuba phezulu.
You know that well.	Uyayazi kakuhle loo nto.
I'm not sure how it happened.	Andazi ncam ukuba kwenzeke njani.
She told her mother.	Waxelela umama wakhe.
Helping people.	Ukunceda abantu.
I certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndenze njalo.
He talked at length about the problem.	Wathetha ixesha elide ngale ngxaki.
My wife does this here.	Umfazi wam wenza lento apha.
But it will come.	Kodwa iya kuza.
He started working.	Waqalisa ukusebenza.
You've done it.	Ukhe wenza.
But I can't.	Kodwa andikwazi.
I'm not going anywhere.	andiyi ndawo.
Saying the right thing.	Ukuthetha into elungileyo.
Then it happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka.
I think that's good.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I knew it.	Ndandisazi.
Do not have children	Musa ukuba nabantwana
I did not look.	Khange ndijonge.
I had no idea how to do it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
How far back, he doesn't know.	Ukuba kude kangakanani emva, akazi.
I didn't want to die, really.	Ndandingafuni ukufa, ngokwenene.
He did not want trouble.	Wayengafuni ngxaki.
You better do that.	Kungcono wenze oko.
It’s hard to see what’s wrong with that.	Kunzima ukubona ukuba yintoni engalunganga kuloo nto.
So he told me.	Undixelele ke.
He knows the answer to every problem.	Uyayazi impendulo kuyo yonke ingxaki.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi lonto.
He said he would like that.	Wathi angathanda oko.
Now, we have to do it this way.	Ngoku, kufuneka siyenze ngolu hlobo.
I want to speak clearly.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngokucacileyo.
If you can only do it.	Ukuba ungayenza kuphela.
You are the person you want to be with.	Ungumntu ofuna ukuba naye.
I wanted to walk around town.	Bendifuna ukuhamba ndijonge edolophini.
I wanted to help you.	Bendifuna ukukunceda.
But after my time.	Kodwa emva kwexesha lam.
We will definitely be back.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kubuya.
He asked to drive.	Wacela ukuqhuba.
Only that far.	Kuphela ukuba kude.
We did.	Senze.
You really deserve it.	Ufanele ngokwenene.
It is impossible to succeed.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba uphumelele.
At first he did not know where he was or why.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi ukuba uphi okanye kutheni.
One, you think you can't get out.	Enye, ucinga ukuba awukwazi ukuphuma.
Someone has to talk.	Kufuneka umntu athethe.
I did it once.	Ndenza kanye.
Doing more can be good for you.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi kunokuba kuhle kuwe.
It will be.	Kuya kuba.
You say that.	Uthetha lonto.
He gave me that.	Wandinika loo nto.
And even then, it doesn't have to be this way.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akufuneki kube njalo.
It will be this.	Iya kuba yile.
I don't have to talk to you.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndithethe nawe.
In the morning he felt better.	Ekuseni waziva engcono.
Yes, that's right!	Ewe, kulungile!
I have to come.	Kufuneka ndifike.
You will find time.	Uya kufumana ixesha.
Or someone, by that.	Okanye umntu, ngaloo nto.
And you know.	Kwaye uyazi.
I will be with you.	Ndiya kuba nawe.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani.
He said no.	Wathi akunjalo.
He certainly never mentioned it to me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange athethe ngayo kum.
She has finished.	Uye wagqiba.
That's the only way to do it.	Yiloo ndlela kuphela yokwenza oko.
Not in the afternoon.	Hayi emva kwemini.
Not our problem.	Hayi ingxaki yethu.
But if you are.	Kodwa ukuba ukhona.
Or more than that.	Okanye ngaphezu koko.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Ndifuna undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
He did not come for long.	Akazange afike ixesha elide.
I don't know how that happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
I think he will be here soon.	Ndicinga ukuba uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
I can't imagine where it is.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba iphi na.
They will have children.	Baza kuba nabantwana.
I'm not even sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba yintoni na.
I want you to sit down next to him.	Ndifuna uye kuhlala phantsi ecaleni kwakhe.
He came down after that.	Wehla emva koko.
I did a few other things, too.	Ndenze ezinye izinto ezimbalwa, nam.
But what happens, you want to talk.	Kodwa kwenzeka ntoni, ufuna ukuthetha.
You too wait a bit.	Nawe ulinde kancinci.
I did not go.	Andizange ndihambe.
And the first woman.	Kwaye umfazi wokuqala.
What are you standing here for?	Umele ntoni ke apha?
You may be sitting here.	Usenokuba uhleli apha.
No one else does that on a regular basis.	Akakho omnye umntu owenza loo nto rhoqo.
Thank you for it.	Enkosi ngayo.
Do not stay in one place for too long.	Musa ukuhlala kwindawo enye ixesha elide.
I made coffee.	Ndenze ikofu.
And your wife loves it.	Kwaye umfazi wakho uyayithanda.
Or a car ?.	Okanye imoto?.
I had no idea where to look.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndijonge phi na.
No, until later.	Hayi, kude kube kamva.
See how he does.	Jonga ukuba wenza njani.
He says he wants money.	Uthi ufuna imali.
If there is anything to get.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na ukufumana.
But he arrived a long time later.	Kodwa wafika emva kwexesha elide.
I don't have to say anything.	Akufunekanga ndithethe nto.
I'll be back in the evening.	Ndiya kubuya ngokuhlwa.
No, he finished.	Hayi, wagqiba.
I've seen enough.	Ndibone ngokwaneleyo.
No, no sorry.	Hayi, hayi uxolo.
You are telling the truth.	Uthetha inyaniso.
He said he did probably.	Wathi uyenzile mhlawumbi.
Everyone should go to lunch.	Wonke umntu kufuneka aye kwisidlo sasemini.
That's great.	Kuhle kakhulu ke.
Or will you want to.	Okanye ngaba uya kufuna.
Well, what could be the problem.	Ewe, ingaba yintoni ingxaki.
I can't think of it that way.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo ngolo hlobo.
I'm not having fun right now.	Andikho mnandi okwangoku.
Now, of course, maybe it could be much better.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, mhlawumbi kunokuba ngcono kakhulu.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
And he said he was not alone.	Kwaye wathi ayinguye yedwa.
Speaking of the night away.	Ukuthetha ubusuku kude.
Please help.	Nceda wenze uncedo.
Ability to eat.	Kukwazi ukutya.
More than he knew about her.	Ngaphezu kokuba wayesazi ngaye.
I don't know what the problem might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
And we need your help.	Kwaye sifuna uncedo lwakho.
This will be even more difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
Everyone seems to be something to you.	Wonke umntu ubonakala ngathi yinto kuwe.
Not out here.	Hayi apha phandle.
I don’t know what I did, really.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni, ngokwenene.
In fact, he never said a word.	Ukuthetha inyani, akazange athethe nto kwaphela.
I'm sure I do too.	Ndiqinisekile nam.
I'm leaving soon.	Ndiza kuhamba kungekudala.
Now he knew that was not the case.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba akunjalo.
Yes, he would come to school.	Ewe, wayeza kufika esikolweni.
I wanted something better.	Ndandifuna into engcono.
At home every night as soon as possible.	Ekhaya rhoqo ebusuku kwangoko kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
And this is exactly the case here.	Kwaye oku kunjalo apha.
One day it will be very difficult for you.	Ngenye imini kuya kuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
But something, something.	Kodwa into, into.
One, they went to college.	Enye, baya ekholejini.
He stays with me all day.	Uhlala nam imini yonke.
They built a new one.	Bakhe entsha.
He works long hours every day.	Usebenza iiyure ezininzi yonke imihla.
We just want your dad.	Sifuna nje utata wakho.
He had to do this.	Kwafuneka ayenze le nto.
You are sure of this.	Uqinisekile ngale nto.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka.
He could not say exactly what that was.	Akazange akwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni kanye kanye leyo.
I, here I am.	Mna, ndim lo.
He can't be far away.	Akakwazi ukuba kude.
He started going to the house.	Waqalisa ukuya endlini.
I feel that way.	Ndiziva njalo.
You know that too.	Nawe uyayazi lonto.
Is that, yes.	Ngaba oko, ewe.
But this is not the case today.	Kodwa oku akunjalo namhlanje.
There is only so much to know about it at a time.	Kukho kuphela ukwazi ngayo ngexesha.
Of course, I wanted to stay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ndandifuna ukuhlala.
Later, he said, but not now.	Kamva, wathi, kodwa hayi ngoku.
For so long.	Ixesha elide kangaka.
Not far from it.	Hayi kude kuyo.
Just to see if you exist.	Ukubona nje ukuba ukhona na.
But he does not need to know more.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba azi ezinye.
This book is for everyone.	Le ncwadi yakhe wonke umntu.
Okay, and down.	Kulungile, kwaye phantsi.
But we have to go very well.	Kodwa kufuneka sihambe kakuhle kakhulu.
I don't think so.	Andiqondi ukuba akunjalo.
Your friends are friends.	Abahlobo bakho abahlobo.
Now there is.	Ngoku kukho.
He would get better.	Wayeza kuba ngcono.
We'll see what happens this week.	Siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kule veki.
Now, maybe, he can do it again.	Ngoku, mhlawumbi, angayenza kwakhona.
I just wanted to talk to him, talk to him.	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha naye, ndithethe naye.
That's your problem.	Nantso ingxaki yakho.
he asked me.	wandibuza.
He said he never went there.	Wathi akazange aye apho.
Because you want to.	Ngenxa yokuba ufuna.
He will continue without me.	Uya kuqhubeka ngaphandle kwam.
It's really hard to drive like that.	Kunzima ngenene ukuqhuba ngolo hlobo.
Only something that comes later.	Kuphela into eza kamva.
One knows better.	Umntu wazi ngcono.
No, it did not.	Hayi, ayizange.
I'm glad you feel better.	Ndiyavuya uziva ngcono.
Whatever it means.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni na.
But it would be better if you knew how to do it.	Kodwa kuya kuba ngcono ukuba uyazi ukuba wenze njani.
You are right, but you are not visible.	Ulungile, kodwa awubonakali.
We will try your way.	Siza kuzama ngendlela yakho.
It would be difficult to remain human.	Bekuya kuba nzima ukuhlala ungumntu.
I'm not here now.	Andikho ngoku.
I haven't heard of him since.	Andizange ndive ngaye ukusukela oko.
Eventually he would tell her the whole story.	Ekugqibeleni wayeza kumxelela lonke ibali.
I just tried to control myself.	Ndazama nje ukuzibamba.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
This job requires you to move as slowly as possible.	Lo msebenzi ufuna ukuba uhambe kancinci kangangoko.
He is moving very slowly.	Uhamba kancinci kakhulu.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
He took his place.	Wathatha indawo yakhe.
You said something this morning.	Uthethe into ngale ntsasa.
No one will have to know.	Akukho mntu kuya kufuneka azi.
The book is good, he said, but.	Incwadi ilungile, wathi, kodwa.
And the man died.	Wafa ke lo mntu.
It is impossible to find anything.	Akunakwenzeka ukufumana nantoni na.
We will definitely stay here again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuhlala apha kwakhona.
You better wear your hat.	Kungcono unxibe umnqwazi wakho.
It is better to do the work.	Kungcono ukwenza umsebenzi.
I wonder if this is okay.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba oku kulungile.
Oko.	Oko.
He will not do this to her.	Akayi kuyenza le nto kuye.
What time is it? 	Ngubani ixesha?
All the way.	Yonke indlela.
This is what we want.	Oku sifuna.
One day, for sure.	Ngenye imini, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Even if it happens to people.	Nokuba kwenzeka ukuba abantu.
It is impossible to know anything for sure.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba wazi nantoni na ngokuqinisekileyo.
Lots of money this time.	Imali eninzi ngeli xesha.
He must agree to help.	Ufanele avume ukunceda.
How are you coming?	Uza kuza njani?
However, he said the gun really looks good.	Nangona kunjalo, uthe umpu ukhangeleka ngokwenene.
All of that will be difficult.	Konke oko kuya kuba nzima.
We will not be.	Asiyi kuba.
I don't know what that is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na leyo.
It seemed they didn't.	Kwakubonakala ngathi abazange.
Now two days.	Ngoku iintsuku ezimbini.
I can’t imagine what he would do with it.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba uya kwenza ntoni ngayo.
You told me you didn't.	Undixelele ukuba awuzange.
That means it is true.	Oko kuthetha ukuba yinyani.
I know about him, just.	Ndiyazi ngaye, nje.
Of course it should.	Ewe kunjalo, kufuneka kube njalo.
You have to leave before he gets here.	Kufuneka uhambe phambi kokuba afike apha.
I have gone far.	Ndiye kude.
Tell me that again.	Ndixelele lonto kwakhona.
One day at that time.	Ngenye imini ngelo xesha.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
I wanted to know everything.	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into.
It has never been so before.	Zange kube njalo ngaphambili.
It could be me.	Inokuba ndim lo.
The doctor.	Ugqirha.
Everyone knows she is.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba unjalo.
He stayed then.	Wahlala ke.
You know us.	Uyasazi.
I hope you have succeeded.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uphumelele.
This is unlikely to be the case	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kube yinyani
Because he is not alone.	Kuba ayinguye yedwa.
And you can't.	Kwaye awukwazi.
Of course, together.	Kunjalo, kunye.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
Then he looked back.	Emva koko wajonga ngasemva.
I will be.	Ndiza kuba.
Everything is small.	Yonke into encinci.
You can't stay long right now.	Awukwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide ngoku.
We'll be there first.	Siza kuba lapho kuqala.
You actually made a number for him.	Ngenene wenze inombolo kuye.
His wife knew otherwise.	Umfazi wakhe wayesazi ngenye indlela.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngale nto.
He asked me. 	Uye wandibuza. 
The problem for sure.	Ingxaki ngokuqinisekileyo.
Even if you think so, maybe not.	Nokuba ucinga ukuba kunjalo, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
And then, in the end, he never tried.	Kwaye ke, ekugqibeleni, khange azame.
So, it is you.	Ngoko, nguwe.
I read at the beginning yes.	Ndifunde ekuqaleni ewe.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ncam.
He doesn't like this.	Akayithandi le nto.
But I wonder.	Kodwa ndiyazibuza.
That never happened to us.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto kuthi.
That makes it easier.	Oko kwenza kube lula.
If we are going to do this together.	Ukuba siza kuyenza kunye le nto.
I did one.	Ndenze enye.
You don’t want me to think for myself.	Awufuni ndicinge ngokwam.
If you are here, fine.	Ukuba ulapha, kulungile.
You may be busy.	Inokuba uxakekile.
I would, too.	Ndingathanda, nam.
I never thought of anything else about it.	Khange ndicinge enye into ngayo.
It happened, and it happened a lot.	Kwenzeka, kwaye kwenzeka kakhulu.
Something very unusual happened next.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo emva koko.
But he ran away.	Kodwa wabaleka.
You will have to go now.	Kuya kufuneka uhambe ngoku.
Me, me, me.	Mna, mna, mna.
She has eaten her breakfast.	Uye watya isidlo sakusasa sakhe.
I went to his room.	Ndaya egumbini lakhe.
He ate quickly and left.	Watya ngokukhawuleza wahamba.
I did things.	Ndenze izinto.
But we did not do that.	Kodwa asizange siyenze loo nto.
He was not very successful.	Akazange aphumelele kakhulu.
But I doubt I can do this.	Kodwa ndiyathandabuza ukuba ndingayenza le nto.
Of course I'm not entirely sure about it.	Ewe andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngayo.
What happened to you ?.	Kwenzeke ntoni kuwe?.
Look at me.	Ujonge mna.
There is something wrong with it, you know.	Kukho into engalunganga ngayo, uyazi.
He really did, so he did.	Ngokwenene uye wayenza, ngoko wayenza.
I know you want some.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ezinye.
Until, of course, it is not.	Kude kube, kunjalo, akunjalo.
And it is more difficult than you would like it to be.	Kwaye kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba ungathanda ukuba kube njalo.
Why did he come here.	Kutheni eze apha.
He knows he will do it himself.	Uyazi ukuba uya kuyenza ngokwakhe.
I want to die a little.	Ndifuna ukufa kancinci.
I don't want to have it.	Andifuni ukuba nayo.
This is what we want to do.	Yile nto sifuna ukuyenza.
Not now more.	Hayi ngoku ngakumbi.
I will not be too good at it.	Andiyi kuba mhle kakhulu kuyo.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo.
We will do better.	Siza kwenza ngcono.
He has to do a better job.	Kufuneka enze umsebenzi ongcono.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
Or if someone is there.	Okanye ukuba kukho umntu apho.
I thought I should go to it.	Ndacinga ukuba ndiye kuyo.
He has to make music.	Kufuneka enze umculo.
Home again, home again.	Ekhaya kwakhona, ekhaya kwakhona.
I thought about it a lot back there.	Ndacinga ngayo kakhulu phaya emva.
Maybe after that.	Mhlawumbi emva koko.
Not much is happening there.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apho.
Either way is right for me.	Nayiphi na indlela ilungile kum.
How long it seems.	Kudala kangakanani kubonakala.
Are you talking about him?	Ngaba uthetha ngaye?
But not always.	Kodwa hayi rhoqo.
Really weird.	Ngokwenene engaqhelekanga.
I do not know when he will be here.	Andazi ukuba uzakuba nini apha.
Clearly you want something from me.	Kucacile ufuna into kum.
But this is my job.	Kodwa lo ngumsebenzi wam.
It will take years.	Kuya kuthatha iminyaka.
You can do that someday.	Ungayenza loo nto ngenye imini.
To make my story.	Ukwenza ibali lam.
I knew a lot.	Ndandisazi kakhulu.
This is not what happened here.	Ayisiyiyo le nto yenzekileyo apha.
Definitely a great deal.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinto enkulu.
And no one did.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza.
So, give me a name.	Ngoko, ndinike igama.
I can't get enough of it.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
And then tell me.	Kwaye ke ndixelele.
You said the right thing, every time.	Uthethe into elungileyo, rhoqo.
He appeared.	Wabonakala.
This one is really interesting.	Lo unomdla ngokwenene.
If you like that, then you are fine.	Ukuba uyayithanda loo nto, ke ulungile.
He talked about it.	Wathetha ngaloo nto.
I knew nothing about him at the time.	Ndandingazi nto ngaye ngelo xesha.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
I want to go to college.	Ndifuna aye ekholejini.
Then together he left	Emva koko kunye wahamba
Very nice room.	Igumbi elihle kakhulu.
He said it would not happen.	Wathi akuyi kwenzeka.
He walked behind her.	Wahamba emva kwakhe.
And you probably know why.	Kwaye usenokuba uyazi ukuba kutheni.
The same is true in this case.	Kunjalo kwakhona kule meko.
He is the first person to succeed.	Ungumntu wokuqala ukuphumelela.
You know you are.	Uyazi ukuba wena.
I'm not sure about anything really.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo nantoni na ngokwenene.
Maybe you are really busy.	Mhlawumbi uxakekile ngokwenene.
I never went to this place.	Andizange ndiye kule ndawo.
He hoped she was okay.	Wayenethemba lokuba ulungile.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngaye.
I really did, he thought.	Ndiyenzile ngokwenene, wacinga.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
I can read a book.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda incwadi.
I think you know.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi.
I don't believe you do this.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenza le nto.
He did not know how or when.	Wayengazi ukuba njani okanye nini.
Stop thinking like that.	Yeka ukucinga ngolo hlobo.
You have left before.	Ukhe wemka ngaphambili.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
He took all over the bed.	Wathatha yonke indawo ebhedini.
But of course it is.	Kodwa kunjalo kunjalo.
It finally happened.	Ekugqibeleni kwenzeka.
But he is not far off.	Kodwa akakho kude.
It should only happen once, however.	Kufuneka kwenzeke kube kanye kuphela, nangona kunjalo.
I don't think they will.	Andiqondi ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
He must know.	Kufuneka akwazi.
You do not have to grieve over him.	Akufunekanga ube buhlungu ngenxa yakhe.
You will not return.	Awuyi kubuya.
He got out of it.	Waphuma kuyo.
And so on and so forth.	Kwaye njalo njalo njalo njalo.
So we'll see.	Ngoko siza kubona.
I will do anything to make it happen.	Ndiza kwenza nantoni na ukwenza ukuba yenzeke.
Again, it often does.	Kwakhona, udla ngokuba njalo.
And he saw more.	Kwaye wabona ngakumbi.
He seems to be doing very well.	Ubonakala esenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I had no idea it could be so beautiful.	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba mhle ngolu hlobo.
I just want to say this.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha oku.
This can be painful for me.	Oku kunokuba buhlungu kum.
But in a new way.	Kodwa ngendlela entsha.
It will be the same thing.	Iya kuba yinto enye.
He is looking at us.	Ujonge kuthi.
He spends a lot of time there.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi apho.
Then there was none.	Emva koko kwakungekho.
In this, we will start at the beginning.	Kule, siza kuqala ekuqaleni.
Well, one more thing.	Kulungile, into enye kwakhona.
That one is you.	Lowo omnye nguwe.
He didn't need to talk so much like that.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe kakhulu ngolo hlobo.
I can't either.	Nam andikwazi.
I love it this way.	Ndiyayithanda ngale ndlela.
If you will, you will.	Ukuba uyathanda, uya kwenza njalo.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi kakhulu.
I can speak.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha.
He said, "thank you,"	Wathi, "enkosi,"
He opened the door slightly.	Wavula ucango kancinci.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.	Ndixelele ke kancinci ngawe.
He would stay.	Wayeza kuhlala.
They say you want to do the right thing.	Bathi ufuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
This process will continue for many years.	Le ndlela iya kuqhubeka iminyaka emininzi.
No one has ever decided for sure.	Akukho mntu wakha wagqiba ngokuqinisekileyo.
Bigger than you.	Enkulu kunawe.
He could not stop.	Akazange akwazi ukuyeka.
Better yet, perhaps.	Kungcono kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
I am very sorry about this situation.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngale meko.
You cannot and will not succeed.	Awunako kwaye awuyi kuphumelela.
What do you think of that?	Ucinga ntoni ngaloo nto?
I know you want to talk to me.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nam.
This is what it is.	Yile nto ke.
So something happened.	Ngoko ke kukho into eyenzekayo.
Large number.	Inombolo enkulu.
And yes, for very little money.	Kwaye ewe, ngemali encinci kakhulu.
No one will ever know.	Akukho mntu uya kuze azi.
He became a human being.	Waba ngumntu.
That is not the case.	Ayisiyiyo ke leyo.
What do you think will happen next?	Ucinga ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko?
You have never said anything like this before.	Zange uthethe into enje ngaphambili.
He continued as before.	Waqhubeka njengakuqala.
Or two weeks.	Okanye iiveki ezimbini.
I tried to stay.	Ndazama ukuhlala.
He knew he knew.	Wayesazi ukuba wayesazi.
I just wanted you to know that.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba uyazi loo nto.
Well where you have it.	Kulungile apho unayo.
I am going to the hospital.	Ndiya esibhedlele.
You did the right thing	Wenze into elungileyo
And if you do.	Kwaye ukuba wenza.
Everything we did not do.	Yonke into asizange siyenze.
Location in town.	Indawo edolophini.
Maybe I will.	Mhlawumbi ndiza kwenza njalo.
Or for a long time.	Okanye ixesha elide.
But he will soon speak.	Kodwa kungekudala uza kuthetha.
Or tomorrow night.	Okanye ngomso ebusuku.
So, this is not really possible.	Ngoko ke, oku akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
I can't read music.	Andikwazi ukufunda umculo.
It seemed to be inhabited.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuhlala abantu.
But almost everyone is very confident.	Kodwa phantse wonke umntu uqinisekile kakhulu.
That will be easier.	Oko kuya kuba lula ngakumbi.
He gave me a shirt.	Uye wandinika ihempe.
It's made so easy.	Yenziwe lula ngolo hlobo.
I thought you were the only one.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe wedwa.
This will take time.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
Who is he? 	Ngubani?
Other than that, very playful, for sure.	Ngaphandle koko, ukudlala kakhulu, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I know you can do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza le nto.
I don't even know how to do that.	Andazi nokuba ungayenza njani loo nto.
I thought the same thing.	Ndandicinga into enye.
But he did.	Kodwa wakwenza oko.
Is really your place.	Ngaba ngokwenene indawo yakho.
Almost a month earlier.	Phantse kwinyanga ngaphambili.
He didn't want anything else.	Akazange afune enye into.
But we will continue.	Kodwa siza kuqhubeka.
You do not want to talk.	Awufuni kuthetha.
Because there is more.	Kuba kukho ngakumbi.
He knows what needs to be done.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka yenziwe.
I know a lot about you.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngawe.
I could not do the work.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi.
I should have sat next to him.	Bekufanele ndihlale ecaleni kwakhe.
Do not forget to take an umbrella.	Ungalibali ukuthatha iambrela.
Working and being the same thing.	Ukusebenza kunye nokuba yinto enye.
You can't, you just don't want to.	Awunako, awufuni nje.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
You work harder than you seem to think.	Usebenza kakhulu kunokuba ubonakala ucinga.
And that's hard.	Kwaye oko kunzima.
Maybe you did something wrong and then made a mistake.	Mhlawumbi wenze into engalunganga waza wenza impazamo.
Aware of.	Uyazi ukuba.
It was not.	Kwakungekho.
You will see, you will see.	Uya kubona, uya kubona.
He agreed.	Wavuma.
If you already have it, it's good for you.	Ukuba sele unayo, kulungile kuwe.
Not unless there is something wrong with him.	Hayi ngaphandle kokuba kukho into kuye.
I saw him yesterday morning.	Ndimbone kusasa izolo.
I don't know how he did it.	Andazi ukuba uyenzile njani loo nto.
And other than that, it is not necessary.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, akuyomfuneko.
Just look inside.	Jonga nje ngaphakathi.
I'm not sure it will ever happen.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuya kuze kwenzeke.
Or to be true to us, but not to him.	Okanye ukuba yinyani kuthi, kodwa hayi kuye.
He is very much here.	Ulapha kakhulu.
His work must be very difficult.	Umsebenzi wakhe kufuneka ube nzima kakhulu.
And it's good.	Kwaye kuhle.
I wanted more than that.	Ndandifuna ngaphezu koko.
Therefore,	Ngoko ke,
No, in it.	Hayi, kuyo.
It would be hard for him to say anything.	Kuya kuba nzima kuye ukuba athethe nantoni na.
I never became my friend.	Zange ndibe ngumhlobo wam.
But if you are here, you probably know.	Kodwa ukuba ulapha, mhlawumbi uyazi.
He can't stay.	Akakwazi kuhlala.
That will be so.	Oko kuya kuba njalo.
He will have to think of something else.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngenye into.
I could not.	Andizange ndikwazi.
''.	''.
That's why we go to him together.	Yiyo loo nto siya kuye kunye.
No one will be with us long enough.	Akukho mntu uya kuba nathi ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
Yes, until.	Ewe, kude kube.
How it should be.	Kufuneka kube njani.
That happened to him.	Kwenzeka loo nto kuye.
He goes to talk.	Uhamba ukuthetha.
Or because you're scared, or whatever.	Okanye ngenxa yokuba uyoyika, okanye nantoni na.
If anything happens.	Ukuba nantoni na eyenzekayo.
I didn't want to be out there.	Ndandingafuni ukuba phaya phandle.
Yes, this is difficult.	Ewe, oku kunzima.
Now comes the strange thing.	Ngoku kufika into engaqhelekanga.
Not like you.	Hayi njengawe.
Efficiency.	Ukusebenza kakuhle.
Maybe so, but no one will ever know.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo, kodwa akukho mntu uya kuze azi.
He left just after breakfast.	Wemka kanye emva kwesidlo sakusasa.
Just 'far enough outside.	Nje 'kude ngokwaneleyo ngaphandle.
No, it's true.	Hayi, yinyani.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange akwazi.
I do not remember much.	Andikhumbuli kakhulu.
I have to do it.	Kufuneka ndiyenze.
Today we did.	Namhlanje senze njalo.
I don't think you should be.	Andiqondi ukuba ufanele ukuba njalo.
I do not know how far.	Andazi ukuba kude kangakanani.
I do not know where you live.	Andazi ukuba uhlala phi.
But he did not think why.	Kodwa akazange acinge ukuba kwakutheni.
He is staying with us right now.	Uhleli nathi okwangoku.
Let me stay with you.	Makhe ndihlale nawe.
It would be nice to stay inside.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuhlala ngaphakathi.
But tell me.	Kodwa ndixelele.
This seems to be really good for you.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kulungile ngokwenene kuwe.
She wants him to know that she loves him.	Ufuna azi ukuba uyamthanda.
Every morning to go to work.	Rhoqo kusasa ukuya emsebenzini.
I did not want to stay.	Bendingafuni kuhlala.
No, you want someone there, I don't say.	Hayi, ufuna umntu apho, andithi.
There is no way to make this happen.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oku kwenzeke.
Just as it works.	Kanye njengokuba usebenza.
It can be a good idea.	Inokuba licebo elihle.
Now that’s a big deal !.	Ngoku yinto enkulu!.
What to do.	Ukwenza ntoni.
So this job became very difficult.	Ngoko lo msebenzi waba nzima kakhulu.
More on that a little bit.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kancinci.
Your son, not so much.	Unyana wakho, hayi kakhulu.
You can't.	Awukwazi.
This did not.	Oku akuzange.
He never told me what it was.	Zange andixelele ukuba yintoni.
Then he found out.	Emva koko wafumana.
What is this.	Yintoni lento.
True in a certain way.	Yinyani ngendlela ethile.
He has to speak.	Kufuneka athethe.
To buy.	Ukuze uthenge.
I didn't want to either.	Nam ndandingafuni.
He did not do a very good job.	Akazange enze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
It can be weird, so out.	Unokuba yinto engaqhelekanga, ngoko ngaphandle.
He always does a lot.	Uhlala esenza kakhulu.
I just live here.	Ndihlala nje apha.
I have to say something to her.	Kufuneka ndithethe into kuye.
That's exactly what this is about.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene oku malunga nayo.
I want this way.	Ndifuna le ndlela.
Because you will have it.	Ngenxa yokuba uya kuba nayo.
That might be it.	Inokuba yiloo nto.
More children.	Abantwana ngakumbi.
Good to know, to have him that way.	Kuhle ukwazi, ukuba naye ngaloo ndlela.
Do not eat meat every day.	Musa ukutya inyama yonke imihla.
This is not just about us.	Oku akukho ngathi kuphela.
Anyone who wants to work with you.	Nabani na ofuna ukusebenza nawe.
You eat regularly all day.	Utya rhoqo imini yonke.
I know nothing about him.	Andazi nto ngaye.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
I want to be a new person.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu omtsha.
I will be there for two weeks.	Ndiza kuba apho iiveki ezimbini.
It must be okay.	Kumele ukuba kulungile.
But it is not there.	Kodwa akukho apho.
I think that money is right.	Ndicinga ukuba loo mali ilungile.
But now.	Kodwa ngoku.
Your dad would love that.	Utata wakho angathanda oko.
I decided to go there if I could.	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndiye kuloo ndawo ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Then, it seems to us.	Emva koko, kubonakala ngathi.
You have to go there.	Kufuneka uye apho.
I wanted to succeed.	Ndandifuna ukuphumelela.
I'm glad you told me.	Ndiyavuya undixelele.
You told him the truth.	Umxelele inyani.
Name only.	Igama kuphela.
There must be an error.	Kumele ukuba kukho impazamo.
You have to go slow.	Kufuneka uhambe kancinci.
He tried to do so.	Wazama ukwenza njalo.
But, you know, what.	Kodwa, uyazi, yintoni na.
So he got into his bed.	Ngoko wangena ebhedini yakhe.
I don't think he did.	Andiqondi ukuba wenza njalo.
He goes better.	Uhamba ngcono.
How good is that!?.	Kuhle kangakanani oko!?.
But not everyone can do that.	Kodwa wonke umntu akanakuyenza loo nto.
However, it is very good.	Nangona kunjalo, kuhle kakhulu.
They will succeed.	Baya kuphumelela.
I do not remember that.	Andikhumbuli oko.
She had children right away.	Waba nabantwana ngoko nangoko.
You would not know better.	Ubungazi ngcono.
You will get better.	Uya kuba ngcono.
I have to learn the place.	Kufuneka ndifunde indawo.
I thought about it.	Ndacinga ngayo .
This could be better.	Oku kunokuba ngcono.
Thus the work will continue.	Uya kuqhubeka ngaloo ndlela ke umsebenzi.
Here I am now.	Ndim lo ke ngoku.
And no, you can't come.	Kwaye hayi, awukwazi ukuza.
Your mother told me, too.	Umama wakho undixelele, naye.
This is about me now.	Oku malunga nam ngoku.
Some people will do very well.	Abanye abantu baya kwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Whatever happens, don't.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na, musa.
I know what happened.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo.
You did very well today.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu namhlanje.
I knew it wasn't.	Ndandisazi ukuba akunjalo.
I know exactly what happened there.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into eyenzekayo apho.
If you are here to stay.	Ukuba ulapha ukuze uhlale.
That will go a long way.	Oko kuya kude kakhulu.
He opened the book.	Wavula incwadi.
He conducts a meeting.	Uqhuba intlanganiso.
He too should have slept.	Naye bekufanele ukuba ulele.
We had to go.	Bekufanele sihambe.
I look forward to more.	Ndilinde ngakumbi.
I don't think it will hurt anything.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba buhlungu nantoni na.
I had to learn more.	Kwafuneka ndifunde ngakumbi.
I don't have to tell you what happened.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndikuxelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
That's a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu leyo kum.
He spent the whole day in the hospital.	Wachitha imini yonke esibhedlele.
Maybe, but not here.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi apha.
I thought my way.	Ndiye ndacinga ngendlela yam ngayo.
No, not just anyone.	Hayi, hayi nje umntu.
He has never had anything like it.	Akazange abe nayo into enje.
That would be easy.	Oko bekuya kuba lula.
But maybe it's okay.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ilungile.
But you must be tired.	Kodwa kufuneka udiniwe.
And you know a thing or two.	Kwaye uyazi into okanye ezimbini.
Not alone.	Akunjalo ndedwa.
So if you have that kind of money.	Ngoko ke ukuba unayo imali enjalo.
Everyone, behind you.	Wonke umntu, emva kwakho.
It seems like a good idea.	Kubonakala ngathi licebo elihle.
And so it happened.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka.
Maybe just a little bit.	Mhlawumbi nje kancinci.
Children have to go to school every day.	Abantwana kufuneka baye esikolweni yonke imihla.
We will be able to.	Siya kukwazi.
I want one, too.	Ndifuna enye, nam.
He wanted to say everything at once.	Wayefuna ukuthetha yonke into ngexesha elinye.
He told it to his wife and children.	Waxelela umfazi nabantwana bakhe ngolo hlobo.
It could be tomorrow.	Inokuba ngomso.
Eventually he was able to sit on the sidelines.	Ekugqibeleni wakwazi ukuhlala ecaleni.
Getting out of prison like that.	Ukuphuma entolongweni ngolo hlobo.
Despite his fear, he continued.	Nangona wayesoyika, waqhubeka.
He knew he had a problem.	Wayesazi ukuba unengxaki.
He pretends to be asleep.	Wenza ngathi ulele.
And to get better.	Kwaye ukuba ngcono.
And you know that you did the right thing.	Kwaye uyazi ke ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
I’ve done that regularly, really.	Ndenze oko rhoqo, ngokwenene.
It would be nice if you could do that.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
And it is true.	Kwaye yinyani.
He will not speak to us.	Akayi kuthetha kuthi.
You did not.	Awuzange.
Not here, not now.	Hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
It's you, isn't it?	Nguwe, akunjalo?
I know his dad, too.	Ndiyamazi utata wakhe, naye.
I do not know why or how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okanye kwenzeke njani oku.
He would leave in his own time.	Wayeza kuhamba ngexesha lakhe.
But this time, it was not.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, kwakungekho.
Of course not.	Ewe akunjalo.
This morning, really.	Ngale ntsasa, ngenene.
son.	unyana.
He wanted, he thought so.	Wayefuna, wacinga njalo.
We have to have it.	Kufuneka sibe nayo.
He wanted something small.	Wayefuna into encinci.
No one will talk to him as much as I do.	Akukho mntu uya kuthetha naye njengam.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oko.
I have to go again.	Kufuneka ndihambe kwakhona.
There is no problem with this.	Akukho ngxaki kule nto.
This can be good.	Oku kunokuba kuhle.
He wanted something else.	Wayefuna enye into.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wenza.
This is not me.	Ayindim lo.
The night is definitely enough now.	Ubusuku ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo ngoku.
Someone said he was.	Omnye umntu wathi nguye.
It will be fun !.	Kuya kuba mnandi!.
I'm thinking of two now.	Ndicinga ezimbini ngoku.
You know what.	Ubusazi yintoni.
She sat down next to him on the bed.	Wahlala ecaleni kwakhe ebhedini.
He arrived home late.	Wafika ekhaya late.
I don't see many people.	Andiboni abantu abaninzi.
If the doctor says it is true, it probably should be.	Ukuba ugqirha uthi yinyani, kunokuba kufuneka kube njalo.
I think that's my job too.	Ndicinga ukuba ngumsebenzi wam lowo nam.
Everyone does that.	Wonke umntu uyayenza loo nto.
He spoke at length about the work.	Wathetha ixesha elide ngalo msebenzi.
He will go, but he will not stay.	Uya kuhamba, kodwa akayi kuhlala.
This is definitely something that needs to be done.	Ngokuqinisekileyo le yinto ekufuneka yenziwe.
I wanted him to leave.	Bendifuna ahambe.
You will have to tell him.	Kuya kufuneka umxelele.
Just look ahead	Jonga phambili nje
I have done this many times.	Ndenze oku izihlandlo ezininzi.
Only a car.	Imoto kuphela.
So it should not be.	Ngoko akufanele kube njalo.
Well, maybe two.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi ezimbini.
Everything, all the time.	Yonke into, lonke ixesha.
And he did it very well.	Kwaye wakwenza kakuhle kakhulu oko.
Food is better.	Ukutya kungcono.
He is just like that.	Unjalo nje.
After that, nothing happened.	Emva koko, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
He would be out.	Wayeza kuba ngaphandle.
Well not bad.	Kulungile hayi kakubi.
I wish him well.	Ndinqwenela ukuba ahambe.
Wherever you are and where you drive.	Nokuba uphi kwaye uqhuba phi.
What's going on here? 	Kuqhubeka ntoni apha?
I think many.	Ndicinga abaninzi.
He will not go far.	Akayi kuya kude.
He has gone down again.	Uye wehla kwakhona.
He may have died.	Usenokuba wafa.
I try to make it better.	Ndizama ukuyenza ngcono.
I only need one.	Ndifuna enye kuphela.
And so, there are many more.	Kwaye ke, kukho ezininzi ngakumbi.
He eventually returned to school.	Ekugqibeleni wabuyela esikolweni.
What did you come for?	Uze ngantoni?
That's all right.	Ilungile kakuhle.
He started to do.	Waqalisa ukwenza.
A little higher.	Kancinci phezulu.
He didn't really want to know, though.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene ukwazi, nangona kunjalo.
My oldest daughter.	Intombi yam endala.
Long before my time.	Kudala ngaphambi kwexesha lam.
In his office that morning.	Eofisini yakhe ngaloo ntsasa.
He asked to speak with us.	Wacela ukuthetha nathi.
But look at the big picture.	Kodwa jonga umfanekiso omkhulu.
He wants to learn.	Ufuna ukufunda.
To stay.	Ukuhlala.
Is, here I am.	Ngaba, ndim lo.
But my mother.	Kodwa umama wam.
A little more, please?	Kancinci ngakumbi, nceda?
If you make it easy, it will be better.	Ukuba uyenza lula, kuya kuba ngcono.
You need to have friends.	Kufuneka ube nabahlobo.
This is really the case.	Oku kunjalo ngokwenene.
He was not alone.	Wayengekho yedwa.
Yes, that is what happened.	Ewe, oko kwenzeka.
That takes a long time to do.	Oko kuthatha ixesha elide ukwenza.
He can't come home.	Akakwazi ukuza ekhaya.
Obviously that never happened.	Ngokucacileyo oko akuzange kwenzeke.
And so, that's it, too.	Kwaye kunjalo, yiloo nto, nayo.
Something very unusual happened.	Kwenzeke into engaqhelekanga.
But everyone knows it.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyayazi.
The work was difficult.	Lo msebenzi waba nzima.
I didn't do it regularly.	Andizange ndiyenze rhoqo.
Thank you for this.	Enkosi ngale nto.
Look, that's not it.	Jonga, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
I don't always believe, myself.	Andikholelwa njalo, ngokwam.
There is such a thing.	Kukho into enjalo.
You only spoke your mind.	Uthethe ingqondo yakho kuphela.
He gave me his place.	Wandinika indawo yakhe.
How strange it was, he thought.	Indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo, wacinga.
At first nothing happened.	Ekuqaleni akuzange kwenzeke nto.
That comes later.	Oko kuza kamva.
However the marriage did not last.	Nangona kunjalo umtshato awuzange uhlale.
He thought of another place to stay.	Wacinga ngenye indawo yokuhlala.
We want peace.	Sifuna uxolo.
I'm scared of all this.	Ndiyoyika yonke lento.
You play fast.	Udlala ngokukhawuleza.
I know about everything.	Ndiyazi ngayo yonke into.
It has happened before.	Kuye kwenzeka ngaphambili.
But that is so.	Kodwa oko kunjalo.
What happened next.	Kwenzeka ntoni emva koko .
No one told me about it.	Akukho mntu wandixelela ngayo.
He didn’t stay long, though.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
To me, of course, in this case.	Kum, kunjalo, kule meko.
Your life now.	Ubomi bakho ngoku.
You will be down like that, everyone said.	Uya kuba phantsi ngolo hlobo, wonke umntu wathi.
I knew something was happening to him, to us.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuye, kuthi.
It’s not easy, it’s not really.	Akukho lula, akunjalo ngokwenene.
There is something wrong with this.	Kukho into kule nto.
Now there is no waiting at all.	Ngoku akukho kulinda kwaphela.
I will find a new place to stay.	Ndiza kufumana indawo entsha yokuhlala.
I don't know why this is.	Andazi ukuba kutheni le nto.
I don't think this will ever happen again.	Andiqondi ukuba iya kuze yenzeke le nto kwakhona.
Last night.	Izolo ebusuku.
My wife made lunch.	Umfazi wam wenze isidlo sasemini.
The truth is, I'm not the only one here.	Inyaniso kukuba, ayindim kuphela apha.
I think that's going to happen.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Your three years.	Iminyaka emithathu yakho.
He often arrives late for school.	Usoloko efika emva kwexesha esikolweni.
It should be fun !.	Kufuneka kube mnandi!.
You're right dad.	Ulungile utata.
He returned to town.	Wabuyela edolophini.
Is that so?	Ngaba kunjalo?
He just did.	Wenza nje.
You want to learn everything about everything.	Ufuna ukufunda yonke into ngayo yonke into.
But nothing to do.	Kodwa akukho ukwenza.
He may not know it.	Usenokuba akazi.
Then he will have to go the other way.	Emva koko kuya kufuneka ahambe enye indlela.
I wanted to know more.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
To do with him.	Ukwenza naye.
He lives there now.	Uhlala khona ngoku.
If my wife stayed with me.	Ukuba umfazi wam wahlala nam.
Tell me about it.	Ndixelele ngaloo nto.
Then, two things happened.	Emva koko, kwenzeka izinto ezimbini.
He finished it himself.	Wagqiba ngokwakhe.
Whatever it does, really.	Nantoni na iya kwenza, ngokwenene.
Don't pretend he didn't.	Musa ukwenza ngathi akenzanga.
That's exactly right.	Yinyani leyo ngenene.
He walks then he walks.	Uhamba ngoko uhamba.
I'm just thinking about you.	Ndicinga nje ngawe.
There is no need to.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba.
He stayed in the hospital for two days.	Wahlala iintsuku ezimbini esibhedlele.
You did well.	Uyenze kakuhle.
We will have to leave immediately.	Kuya kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
But so far I have not.	Kodwa okwangoku andizange.
I do not want to know.	Andifuni ukwazi.
Well, very good.	Kulungile, kuhle kakhulu.
I wish it were later.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube kamva.
I always think of him.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngaye.
I'll go talk to him.	Ndiza kuhamba ndithethe naye.
But you can't stay up late.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala emva kwexesha.
You just look down.	Ujonge phantsi kuphela.
My mother knows nothing about money.	Umama akazi nto ngemali.
And then you.	Kwaye ke wena.
My mother was not there.	Umama wayengekho.
I can't be.	Andikwazi kuba.
Maybe it will be good.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba kuhle.
I will need help.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo.
Then he stayed there.	Emva koko wahlala apho.
Who he wants to be.	Lowo ufuna ukuba nguye.
So he went on to school.	Waqhubeka ke esikolweni.
But he wanted to wait.	Kodwa wayefuna ukulinda.
That's a very good thing to do.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo ukuyenza.
No problem, really.	Akukho ngxaki, ngokwenene.
Everything but nothing, in a strange way.	Yonke into kodwa akukho nto, ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
I'm always waiting for that one.	Ndihlala ndilinde lowo.
I can do that now.	Ndingayenza loo nto ngoku.
I waited long enough.	Ndilinde ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
He did not know what would happen.	Wayengazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
I know that place.	Ndiyayazi loo ndawo.
There is not much there.	Akukho nto ingako apho.
I do what my job requires.	Ndenza oko kufuneka umsebenzi wam.
There seem to be children everywhere.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho abantwana kuyo yonke indawo.
And he wanted more, too.	Kwaye wayefuna ngakumbi, naye.
However, there is something to it.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho into kuyo.
The mind is a strange thing.	Ingqondo yinto engaqhelekanga.
I need to talk to you	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe
Moreover, she is beautiful.	Ngaphezu koko, mhle.
But that's about it.	Kodwa loo nto malunga nayo.
He would go too far to stop.	Wayeza kude kakhulu ukuba ayeke.
And people.	Kwaye abantu.
But there is a way.	Kodwa kukho indlela.
I did not know that he would be here.	Bendingazi ukuba uzakuba lapha.
I can only imagine what it would be like	Ndiyakwazi nje ukucinga ukuba kuya kuba njani
Otherwise, no.	Ngaphandle koko, hayi.
And then it never happened.	Kwaye ke akuzange kube njalo.
I can't wait to get out of here	Andikwazi kulinda ukuphuma apha
I'm trying to be a good person.	Ndizama ukuba ngumntu olungileyo.
I do not understand why	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni
I knew everything about him	Ndandisazi yonke into ngaye
He still does that today.	Wayenza loo nto nangoku.
You know you're happy.	Uyazi ukuba uyavuya.
And, look at me.	Kwaye, ndijonge.
That's the story, of course.	Nantso ibali, kunjalo.
I think you are right.	Ndicinga ukuba ulungile.
He never did, you know.	Akazange ayenze, uyazi.
More time to do what you need to do	Ixesha elingakumbi elingakumbi lokwenza oko kufuneka
I know everything that happens here	Ndiyazi yonke into eyenzekayo apha
Not that it is a bad thing.	Hayi ukuba yinto embi.
That will come.	Oko kuya kufika.
To him, there are.	Kuye, bakho.

I want to see something	Ndifuna ukubona into
Flowers.	Iintyatyambo.

I want to talk about you	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngawe
A word far away	Ilizwi kude
I thought it would be easy	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba lula
You look good in it.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle kuyo.

I hope you know that	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi loo nto
I felt a little bad, you know	Ndive kakubi kancinci, uyazi
See what you are talking about.	Jonga ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
I will create.	Ndiya kudala.
I didn't even see him waiting there	Khange ndimbone nokuba ulinde apho
She would love to travel, and she would also love to stay.	Angathanda ukuhamba, kwaye kwakhona angathanda ukuhlala.
I didn’t know better at the time	Ndandingazi ngcono ngelo xesha
I'm so sorry, I'm not	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu, akunjalo
I can read people well	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda abantu kakuhle
I have tried many times to stop	Ndiye ndazama izihlandlo ezininzi ukuyeka

I will be here	Ndiza kuba apha
Look at things.	Jonga izinto.
I will definitely do it	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza
And then you will certainly have done enough.	Kwaye ke ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba wenze ngokwaneleyo.
I didn't have to tell anyone	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ndixelele mntu
I went to his house	Ndiye ndaya kwakhe
Do not swim here.	Musa ukuqubha apha.
But you really have to go with us.	Kodwa ngokwenene kufuneka uhambe nathi.
Or just about anything else.	Okanye malunga nantoni na enye into.
I know he wasn't.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayengekho.
I spoke to him earlier this afternoon	Ndithethe naye kwangoko ngale njikalanga

Then you have to wait.	Emva koko kufuneka ulinde.

And it's time.	Kwaye lixesha.
I know that will take time	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kuya kuthatha ixesha

I doubt it, but maybe	Ndiyathandabuza, kodwa mhlawumbi
I do not know yet	Andazi okwangoku
I thought it might be high.	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba phezulu.

I think you have it	Ndicinga ukuba unayo
Well you have to go.	Kulungile ukuba kufuneka uhambe.
Well, he didn't say anything.	Ewe, akazange athethe nto.

I will never do this again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndiyenze le nto.
I'm here, with you now	Ndilapha, kunye nawe ngoku
I just need to know what it is	Kufuneka nje ndiyazi ukuba yintoni
he never tried to read the book.	akazange azame ukufunda le ncwadi.

I wanted to talk to you last night	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe phezolo

I knew that was not the case with anyone	Ndandisazi ukuba akunjalo kuthi nabani na
So you know why.	Ngoko uyazi ukuba kukho isizathu.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile kum.

I don't know what it is	Andazi ukuba yintoni na
I would like to learn more from you	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngakumbi kuwe

Another thing he did.	Enye into ayenzileyo.

He has lived there.	Uye wahlala apho.
I wanted to see how you were doing	Bendifuna ukubona ukuba uqhuba njani
Work went on.	Umsebenzi waqhubeka kunjalo.
I don't know if it is.	Andazi noba yiyo na.

And he knew something else, too.	Kwaye wayesazi enye into, naye.
I knew nothing but	Ndandingazi nto kodwa
Look ahead, okay.	Jonga phambili, kulungile.
It must have been about that.	Kumele ukuba malunga naloo nto.

I can't think of it much	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo kakhulu
That's why I'm here.	Yiyo loo nto ndilapha.

I will not say anything.	Andiyi kuthetha nto.
Looking forward	Ndijonge phambili
I wanted more time with you	Bendifuna ixesha elingakumbi nawe
It just seemed like a good idea.	Kwakubonakala nje ukuba licebo elihle.
Inside, however, there is nothing.	Ngaphakathi, nangona kunjalo, akukho nto.
I could not think of him like that	Andizange ndikwazi ukucinga ngaye ngolo hlobo
I'm waiting for your reply	Ndilinde impendulo yakho
I think you like it a lot here.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda kakhulu apha.
I could not do anything.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto.
Not until you tell me what's going on.	Hayi de undixelele ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni na.
He wanted me to stay there.	Wayefuna ndihlale apho.
Time or two.	Ixesha okanye ezimbini.
I could not eat now	Khange ndikwazi ukutya ngoku

He did very well.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I would like to play.	Ndingathanda ukudlala.
Maybe you did too.	Mhlawumbi nawe wenze njalo.
He stayed there many days.	Wahlala apho iintsuku ezininzi.
Then again, and again.	Emva koko kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona.
Yes, not at home.	Ewe, hayi ekhaya.
I wanted to bring it to school	Bendifuna ukuza nayo esikolweni
However, this is not always the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo ngalo lonke ixesha.
I think you know it too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe uyazi.
I think this means that	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuthetha ukuba
Do you really think so.	Ngaba ngokwenene ucinga ngolo hlobo.
I wanted to do a good job.	Ndandifuna ukwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
I deserve time.	Ndifanele ixesha.
Maybe he just wanted to get things done.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukugqiba izinto.
He knew something was going to happen.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka.
It just seemed so.	Kwakubonakala kunjalo nje.
He never knew what he looked like.	Akazange akwazi ukuba ukhangeleka njani.
A little later.	Emva kancinci .
I know you want to come home.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuza ekhaya.
I did well with it	Ndenze kakuhle ngayo
Probably nothing will happen.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto iya kwenzeka.
If you love someone, you love them.	Ukuba uthanda umntu, uyamthanda.
Then everything will be very difficult.	Emva koko yonke into iya kuba nzima kakhulu.
But there is really another way.	Kodwa ngokwenene kukho enye indlela.
I knew then what had happened	Ndandisazi ke ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I knew he wanted to come	Ndandisazi ukuba ufuna ukuza
I saw through him.	Ndabona ngaye.
It takes a long time for that to happen.	Kuthatha ixesha elide ukuba oko kwenzeke.
But the man was clearly afraid.	Kodwa umntu wayesoyika ngokucacileyo.
I can't wait to quit this job	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuyeka lo msebenzi
All, well.	Bonke, kuhle.
Maybe it's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani.
I did not want to work	Ndandingafuni ukusebenza
I really want to know	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwazi
It's just, maybe.	Yinto nje, mhlawumbi.
I can't take something like that	Andikwazi ukuthatha into enjalo
I could not do it	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza
She would like to help.	Angathanda ukunceda.
You are the new person you want to be.	Nguwe omtsha lowo ufuna ukuba nguye.
I thought about that question	Ndacinga ngalo mbuzo
This is not probably, this is true.	Oku ayisiyiyo mhlawumbi, le yinyani.
I just wanted to.	Ndandifuna nje.
It's hard to see that.	Kunzima ukubona loo nto.
I can't think of him right now	Andikwazi ukucinga ngaye ngoku
No one should know.	Akukho mntu ufanele azi.
Or, it should.	Okanye, kufuneka.
A little talk first.	Intetho encinci kuqala.
Really good.	Ngokwenene kulungile.
I would really like that	Ndingathanda ngokwenene oko
And so it seems to us.	Kwaye ngoko kubonakala ngathi.

You play well.	Udlala kakuhle.
I'm glad she's here.	Ndiyavuya kuba elapha.
I thought	Ndikhe ndacinga
But there was no need for that.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukwenjenjalo.
I need to talk quickly with my friends	Kufuneka ndithethe ngokukhawuleza nabahlobo bam
Next to you.	Ecaleni kwakho.
He immediately seemed to be talking too much.	Wabonakala ngokukhawuleza ukuba athethe kakhulu.
This can happen to any of us.	Oku kunokwenzeka kuye nabani na kuthi.
I want to be a doctor	Ndifuna ukuba ngugqirha
Well, to him, that's right.	Ewe, kuye, kunjalo.
Not to him but.	Hayi kuye kodwa.
I just told you that	Ndikuxelele nje lonto
To help you.	Ukukunceda.
No problem yet.	Akukho ngxaki okwangoku.
I had no idea what was going on	Ndandingazi ncam ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I know you want some	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ezinye
I had no idea what was going on	Ndandingazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni na
He knows it for himself.	Uyayazi ngokwakhe.
Mom is waiting outside.	Umama ulinde ngaphandle.
It happened before that.	Kwenzeka ngaphambi koko.
I knew something terrible had happened to me	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekileyo kum
I have to do the right thing	Kufuneka ndenze into elungileyo

I never thought about it	Andizange ndicinge ngayo
I couldn't do anything about it	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto ngaloo nto
I am the truth.	Ndim inyaniso.
I don’t have to think about him	Akufunekanga ndicinge ngaye

I can't talk to her right now	Andikwazi kuthetha naye ngoku
I just want to help you	Ndifuna nje ukukunceda
I did not know where he was	Bendingazi noba uphi
I'm not sure the name.	Andiqinisekanga igama.
I will do it for the rest of my life.	Ndiza kuyenza ubomi bam bonke.
I think he would like to	Ndicinga ukuba angathanda
I knew something bad was going to happen	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into embi eza kwenzeka
Tell me about it again.	Ndixelele ngayo kwakhona.
That would be great, too.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle, kwakhona.
But he does not always think so.	Kodwa akacingi njalo.
All right, with you this afternoon.	Kulungile, kunye nawe ngale njikalanga.
I'm sure	Ndiqinisekile
I wanted to try to do something else	Ndandifuna ukuzama ukwenza enye into
I tried to eat a book	Ndazama ukutya incwadi
He really does make a book.	Uyenza ngokwenene incwadi.
I'm not entirely sure	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo
He could not control himself.	Zange akwazi ukuzibamba.
I arrived on time with him	Ndifike ngexesha kwaye naye
Not like you like it.	Hayi ngathi uyayithanda.
Just money.	Imali nje.
Now and then.	Ngoku kwaye ngoko.
Probably no one.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu.
I wanted many things at once	Ndandifuna izinto ezininzi ngexesha elinye
I had no idea how difficult it could be	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba nzima kangakanani

I did not want to give up	Ndandingafuni ukuyeka
Maybe it will come back.	Mhlawumbi iya kubuya.

We went there.	Siye apho.
I did not arrive early to see	Andizange ndifike kwangethuba ukuze ndibone
I have to go to work immediately	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini ngokukhawuleza
I never looked back	Khange ndiphinde ndijonge ngasemva
He knew there.	Wayesazi apho.
So, it seems impossible.	Ngoko, kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
He has gone again.	Uye wahamba kwakhona.
You will not have to do much.	Akuyi kufuneka wenze okuninzi.
He seems determined now.	Kubonakala ngathi uzimisele ngoku.
He left a message.	Waphuma umyalezo.

To him.	Kuye.
He apologized to all of us.	Wacela uxolo kuthi sonke.

I'm sorry for all that	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke loo nto

This will be easier for you.	Oku kuya kuba lula kuwe.
I think that would be great	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu

I want to learn more about you	Ndifuna ukufunda ngakumbi ngawe
Now do not forget to do your homework.	Ngoku ungalibali ukwenza umsebenzi wakho wasekhaya.
He has done nothing for you.	Akazange enze nto kuwe.
I'll just say it.	Ndiza kuthetha nje.
Music was not what he thought it was.	Umculo awuzange ube yile nto wayecinga ukuba yiyo.
Not so much, not immediately.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kwangoko.
I did not know then	Ndandingazi ngoko
Money can be fun.	Imali inokuba mnandi.
Obviously we will.	Ngokucacileyo siza kwenza njalo.
So much for this.	Ngoko eninzi le nto.
For too long, he thought.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, wacinga.
My work is like that.	Umsebenzi wam unjalo.
Sorry about that, everyone.	Uxolo ngaloo nto, wonke umntu.
He looked back at the house.	Wajonga emva endlini.
But no later.	Kodwa akukho kamva apho.
I know this seems hard for you	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kubonakala kunzima kuwe
I don’t have to look at it	Akufunekanga ndijonge kuyo
I live in a beautiful place	Ndihlala kwindawo entle
I will never have it again	Andiyi kuphinda ndibe nayo
It will be better for us.	Kuya kuba ngcono kuthi.
It will get better this way.	Kuya kuba ngcono ngale ndlela.
I can't say what it is	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni na
Really nice here.	Kuhle ngokwenene apha.
I can't tell you anything else	Andikwazi ukukuxelela enye into
I will never know that either.	Nam soze ndiyazi lonto.
I never told anyone	Khange ndikhe ndixelele mntu
He died well.	Wafa kakuhle.
He looked at her and looked at her.	Wajonga wajonga wajonga.
You didn't, no.	Awuzange, hayi.
I don't remember who he was.	Andikhumbuli ukuba ngubani.
I never thought it would be that hard	Ndandingacingi ukuba kuza kuba nzima ngolo hlobo
But nobody says that.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.

He looked at everyone.	Wajonga wonke umntu.
A little at a time, of course	Kancinci ngexesha, kunjalo
I wanted to go to school	Ndandifuna ukuya esikolweni

He returned to the room immediately.	Wabuyela egumbini ngoko nangoko.
He certainly will not come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akayi kuza.
I can sing a little.	Ndiyakwazi ukucula kancinci.
I can come home every night to you	Ndiyakwazi ukuza ekhaya rhoqo ebusuku kuwe
I didn't know you could do this.	Bendingazi ukuba ungayenza le nto.
This is really happening to us.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene kuthi.
I want to find another place now	Ndifuna ukufumana enye indawo ngoku
Then he heard.	Emva koko weva.
Now you are ready to buy.	Ngoku ukulungele ukuthenga.
I want to work.	Ndifuna ukusebenza.
However, now it is very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
You will buy there.	Uya kuthenga apho.
I can't imagine living so far away from you	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuhlala kude kangaka nawe
I just want to be with you	Ndifuna nje ukuba nawe
I look forward to trying this again !.	Ndijonge phambili ukuzama oku kwakhona!.
I know that right away	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngoko nangoko
Because it's very good, and you know it is.	Ngenxa yokuba ilungile kakhulu, kwaye uyazi ukuba kunjalo.
But there was no need for me to do anything.	Kodwa kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba ndenze nantoni na.
He went ahead himself.	Waya phambili ngokwakhe.
It takes a lot more.	Kuthatha okuninzi ngakumbi.
You should have known better, really.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono, ngenene.
One day at a time.	Ngenye imini ngexesha.
You will need only you.	Uya kufuna wena kuphela.
I never thought that no one would do anything	Andizange ndicinge ukuba akukho mntu wenza nantoni na
I did not.	Andizange.
I had no idea about that	Ndandingazi ngaloo nto
Or for me it's okay.	Okanye kum kulungile.
I know everyone wants to know	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ufuna ukwazi
I want to know why you did this	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni uyenzile le nto
I couldn't walk, just yet	Andikwazanga ukuhamba, okwangoku
And something like that to happen is a big deal.	Kwaye into enje ukuba yenzeke yinto enkulu.
He knew better than to say anything.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba athethe nantoni na.
I want a really new one	Ndifuna entsha ngokwenene
I wanted to eat right away.	Ndandifuna ukutya ngoko nangoko.
Let me speak my mind.	Makhe ndithethe ingqondo yam.
My father is not like that.	Utata akanjalo.
Look up there.	Jonga phaya phezulu.
I can only imagine what it will be like now.	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga nje ukuba uzakuba njani ngoku.
I know where you are going to school	Ndiyakwazi apho uya khona esikolweni
After all, not so much.	Emva koko, hayi kakhulu.
Not entirely, and certainly not the only one.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo, kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kuphela.
I have to do a few things	Kufuneka ndenze izinto ezimbalwa
Finally, he thought.	Ekugqibeleni, wacinga.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
I have no problem with it.	Andikwazi ngxaki kuyo.
I thought everything would be better	Bendicinga ukuba yonke into iya kuba ngcono
So much for it.	Kakhulu kuyo.
I will do this	Ndiza kuyenza le nto
I love his way.	Ndiyayithanda indlela yakhe.
I don't remember much at school	Andikhumbuli kakhulu esikolweni
We need a phone.	Sifuna ifowuni .
Very much in need of help.	Kakhulu ofuna uncedo.
I can't read your mind	Andikwazi ukufunda ingqondo yakho
He stayed there until he died.	Wahlala apho de wafa.
He looked around the house.	Wajonga endlwini.
You have it too.	Nawe unayo.
I can't believe you did such a thing.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenzile into enjalo.
I look further.	Ndijonge ngakumbi.
I don't remember which one	Andikhumbuli ukuba yeyiphi
Not self-restraint.	Hayi ukuzibamba.
I'm sure he is asleep now	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ulele ngoku
I can't wait to read too much for you	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda okuninzi kakhulu kuwe
I always think about it.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngayo.
I know your little problem	Ndiyayazi ingxaki yakho encinci
And about it.	Kwaye malunga nayo.
I don't know what's going on inside, what's going on outside	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngaphakathi, yintoni ngaphandle
You may have continued, if possible.	Usenokuba uye waqhubeka, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He wants to retire early.	Ufuna ukuthatha umhlala-phantsi kwangethuba.
I feel confident here	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile apha
I have spoken to him only once this week	Ndithethe naye kube kanye kuphela kule veki
Of course he wasn't, though.	Ewe wayengekho, nangona kunjalo.
Certainly not the police.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi amapolisa.
Really this time.	Ngokwenene ngeli xesha.
You have to go.	Ufanele ukuhamba.
I need to look more closely at it	Kufuneka ndijonge ngakumbi kuyo
I can't do that right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto okwangoku.
If you are, of course.	Ukuba wena, kunjalo.
I wanted to know more about you.	Bendifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngawe.
Maybe it's time for you to decide.	Mhlawumbi lixesha lokuba wenze isigqibo.
You’ll be staying for dinner, of course.	Uya kuhlala ngesidlo sangokuhlwa, kunjalo.
I didn't have it that morning	Andizange ndibe nayo ngaloo ntsasa
If you do not want to take, do not take.	Ukuba awufuni ukuthatha, musa ukuthatha.
I'm always tired, tired	Ndihlala ndidiniwe, ndidiniwe
Not his parents.	Hayi abazali bakhe.
To go far.	Ukuya kude.
Well, maybe he won't want it now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akasayi kufuna ngoku.
I think this is it.	Ndicinga ukuba yile nto.
That happened to me a few times.	Oko kwenzeka kum izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
I don't remember when	Andikhumbuli ukuba nini
I'm not sure why	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo
You have to go with me now.	Kufuneka uhambe nam ngoku.
I wish it were, but it is not.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo, kodwa akunjalo.
I couldn't talk to her about it	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha naye ngayo
I did not want to die alone	Ndandingafuni ukufa ndedwa
I did not want to know	Ndandingafuni ukwazi
The truth is, no one does.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho mntu wenza.
Nobody makes you do anything.	Akukho mntu ukwenza ukuba wenze nantoni na.
And somebody is going to do just that.	Kwaye kukho umntu oza kuyenza loo nto kanye.
Now, everyone knows everyone and it's even harder.	Ngoku, wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu kwaye kunzima ngakumbi.
Her son came first.	Unyana wakhe weza kuqala.
Or, almost immediately.	Okanye, phantse ngokukhawuleza.
I do not believe this will ever happen	Andikholelwa ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka
Of course this will never happen.	Ewe soze yenzeke le nto.
He did not have to think long.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba acinge ixesha elide.
I will never do it again	Andisayi kuphinda ndiyenze
I should not have gone	Bekungafanelanga ndihambe
He certainly did not need to tell anyone now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba axelele mntu ngoku.
I had no idea how long he had	Ndandingazi ukuba unexesha elingakanani na
And it can be really painful.	Kwaye kunokuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
I need help	Ndifuna uncedo
But only so far.	Kodwa kuphela kude.
I wanted to know what was happening next to him.	Bendifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ecaleni kwakhe.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
Today you mean something, tomorrow you mean something else.	Namhlanje uthetha into, ngomso uthetha enye into.
And there is a reason why.	Kwaye kukho isizathu sokuba.
I told her all this	Ndamxelela yonke lento
I don't know why, he just did.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, wenza nje.
If you leave, that's fine.	Ukuba uthe wemka, kulungile.
I wish we could do that today	Ndinqwenela ukuba siyenze loo nto namhlanje
He immediately recognized that he had made a serious mistake.	Waqonda ngoko nangoko ukuba wenze impazamo enkulu.
A little to us.	Kancinci kuthi.
As maybe every afternoon.	Njengokuba mhlawumbi rhoqo emva kwemini.
Or maybe three.	Okanye mhlawumbi ezintathu.
And other things.	Kwaye ezinye izinto.
I'm happy then	Ndiyavuya ngoko
I never went to college.	Andizange ndiye ekholejini.
I just have to think of other things	Kufuneka nje ndicinge ezinye izinto
And it should not.	Kwaye akufanele.
After all, it probably isn't.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Thanks for being with me again.	Enkosi ngokuba nam kwakhona.
I know you have it in you	Ndiyazi ukuba unayo kuwe
I knew it would be very difficult	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kakhulu
I decided this morning, really	Ndenze isigqibo ngale ntsasa, ngokwenene
I don't know why he did that.	Andazi kwakutheni ukuze enze loo nto.
And my name.	Kwaye igama lam.
I knew nothing about him	Ndandingazi nto ngaye
Tomorrow we will tell a story.	Ngomso siza kuthetha ibali.
It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
I could not stop thinking about you	Khange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngawe
I can tell, and he can	Ndiyakwazi ukuxelela, kwaye naye uyakwazi
You should not look away from me.	Akufunekanga ujonge kude kunam.
I've been here all the time, he thought	Bendisoloko ndilapha ngalo lonke ixesha, wacinga njalo
I can't say that for myself	Andikwazi ukuyithetha ngokwam loo nto
I did not want to go without him	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba ngaphandle kwakhe
I do not remember exactly how long it was probably a few weeks	Andikhumbuli ncam ukuba ixesha elingakanani mhlawumbi iiveki ezimbalwa
I can make music now	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza umculo ngoku
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngale nto.
He did not speak abusively.	Akazange athethe kakubi.
I can't think of anything else	Andikwazi ukucinga ngenye into
Just the truth.	Inyaniso nje.
I hope to be back tonight	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza kubuya ngokuhlwanje
I can't do it right away	Andikwazi ukuyenza ngokukhawuleza
You don't want to do that.	Awufuni ukuyenza loo nto.
But someone else has to do it.	Kodwa omnye umntu kufuneka ayenze.
With that, as.	Ngaloo nto, njengoko.
I'm not sure it will.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
His first job here.	Umsebenzi wakhe wokuqala apha.
Okay, a little bit.	Kulungile, kancinci.
I will stay with you	Ndiza kuhlala nawe
No one will ever think about it again.	Akukho mntu uya kuphinda acinge ngayo.
That is true for me.	Yinyani leyo kum.
Well, we know why.	Ewe, siyazi ukuba kutheni.
I will be there for you	Ndiya kuba lapho kuwe
Maybe he had to do so.	Mhlawumbi kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I know what this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni le.
I did, too.	Ndenze, kakhulu.
He didn't know, really, what it was.	Wayengazi, ngokwenene, ukuba yintoni na.
He thinks he knows everything.	Ucinga ukuba wazi yonke into.
Thank you for being here tonight.	Enkosi ngokuba lapha ngokuhlwanje.
I never lived here again	Khange ndiphinde ndihlale apha
I had to leave, though.	Kwafuneka ndihambe, nangona kunjalo.
I don't remember doing this	Andikhumbuli ndiyenza le nto
I am the one asking for help.	Ndim ndicela uncedo.
You do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze njalo.
You will have to do something about it.	Kuza kufuneka wenze into ngayo.
I didn't want to either	Nam ndandingafuni
I have to go to the hospital now	Kufuneka ndiye esibhedlele ngoku
By the time he got home.	Ngexesha efika ekhaya.
But not today.	Kodwa hayi namhlanje.
I would really like to be your friend too	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuba ngumhlobo wakho nam
I better go.	Kungcono ndihambe.
I just need help	Ndifuna nje uncedo
And yes, you know.	Kwaye ewe, uyazi.
If not for you, it may be because of me.	Ukuba akunjalo kuwe, kunokuba ngenxa yam.
I say this in a positive way.	Ndithetha oku ngendlela elungileyo.
I had to learn to play the piano	Bekufanele ndifunde ukudlala ipiyano
I knew nothing	Ndandingazi nto mna
And me.	Kanye nam.
And this is it.	Kwaye le yinto.
There is nothing here.	Akukho nto apha.
Come to us soon.	Uze kuthi kungekudala.
I have to leave early today	Kufuneka ndihambe kwangethuba namhlanje
You do not have to go far.	Akufuneki ukuba uye phambili kuphela.
I have to go to the office	Kufuneka ndiye eofisini
When it's okay.	Xa kulungile.
But there are more.	Kodwa kukho ezinye.
Inside it.	Ngaphakathi kuyo.
Any.	Nayiphi na.
I'm just tired today.	Ndidiniwe nje namhlanje.
I never thought that others would succeed	Andizange ndicinge ukuba abanye baya kuphumelela
When.	Nanini na.
I wonder why he does this	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni esenza le nto
She was scared now.	Wayesoyika ngoku.
I wanted to know things	Bendifuna ukwazi izinto
I just know the place	Ndiyazi nje indawo
And you know what, well.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yintoni, kulungile.
I'll try to find another one.	Ndiza kuzama ukufumana enye.
I just know it will happen one day	Ndiyazi nje ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe.
I knew it wasn't necessary.	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyomfuneko.
Not exactly though.	Hayi ncam nangona.
Are you coming to me first ?.	Uza kum kuqala?.
Or a son.	Okanye unyana.
No one ever asked.	Akukho mntu wakha wabuza.
I want you to stay with me.	Ndifuna uhlala nam.
And you won't want that.	Kwaye awuyi kufuna loo nto.
That is very old.	Oko kudala kakhulu.
I just want to get out	Ndifuna nje ukuphuma
I think fast	Ndicinga ngokukhawuleza
It could be him.	Inokuba nguye.
I had to think of something	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngento ethile
I want to talk about this.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngale nto.
And you know your answer.	Kwaye uyayazi impendulo yakho.
Very nice, to say the least.	Kuhle kakhulu, ukuthetha kancinci.
I think you don't want to.	Ndicinga ukuba awufuni.
You know.	Uyazi.
It will be better at night	Kuya kuba ngcono ebusuku
I could not control myself	Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba
You are very scared of something.	Uyoyika kakhulu into.
They are all going fast right now.	Bonke baya ngokukhawuleza nangoku.
You feel that way, of course.	Uziva ngolo hlobo, kunjalo.
I didn't want to get to know other people	Ndandingafuni ukwazi abanye abantu
So it would be great.	Ngoko kuya kuba kuhle.
But he also knows it.	Kodwa naye uyayazi.
I never thought traveling would be so difficult	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ukuhamba kuya kuba nzima kangako
If not, nothing.	Ukuba akunjalo, akukho nto.
I wish it were true, but.	Ndinqwenela ukuba yinyani, kodwa.
But it is very difficult to find.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukufumana.
And maybe you like it.	Kwaye mhlawumbi uyayithanda.
I don't know what else it could be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba yintoni enye.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi nangoko.
Now there is nothing more.	Ngoku akukho nto kwakhona.
I don't see a problem there.	Andiboni ngxaki apho.
I did not see or hear anything	Andizange ndibone okanye ndive nantoni na
I tried to swim to it	Ndazama ukuqubha ukuya kuyo
Unless something happens to her, too.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuye, naye.
I have to do it my way.	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngendlela yam.
I hope you do more.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza ngakumbi.
You know, you know.	Uyazi, uyazi.
You have come a long way.	Uze kakhulu.
I did not know this	Bendingayazi le nto
I did not see who she was	Khange ndibone ukuba ngubani
I want to do this	Ndifuna ukuyenza le nto
I do it very well	Ndiyenza kakuhle kakhulu
I need your help	Ndifuna uncedo lwakho
But, it was not.	Kodwa, kwakungekho.
I did not want to talk	Bendingafuni kuthetha
But it seems so.	Kodwa kubonakala kunjalo.
Because it is not just a coincidence.	Kuba asiyonto nje eyenzekileyo.
I can't think straight	Andikwazi ukucinga kakuhle
It all goes on time.	Konke kuhamba ngexesha.
And he did nothing after that	Kwaye akazange enze nto emva koko
And your money.	Kwaye imali yakho.
I want to say it again	Ndifuna ukuyithetha kwakhona
He does that.	Uyayenza loo nto.
He made friends.	Wenza abahlobo.
I love the way things are now.	Ndiyayithanda indlela izinto ngoku.
He used to do that.	Wayedla ngokwenza njalo.
I want to take his place.	Ndifuna ukuthatha indawo yakhe.
And so, really, really.	Kwaye kunjalo, ngokwenene, kunjalo.
His voice in this case.	Ilizwi lakhe kule meko.
And not just any problem.	Kwaye hayi nje nayiphi na ingxaki.
I had to do this myself	Kwafuneka ndiyenze ngokwam le nto
You should not talk to him like that.	Akufunekanga uthethe naye ngolo hlobo.
We did that time and time again and again. 	Senze loo nto ixesha kunye nexesha kunye nexesha kwakhona. 
I wanted to talk to him	Bendifuna ukuthetha naye
She told me about it.	Uye wandixelela ngalonto.
I could not sit still.	Khange ndikwazi tu ukuhlala.
Sorry you had to wait.	Uxolo kuye kwafuneka ulinde.
I just want time	Ndifuna nje ixesha
You have it all.	Unayo yonke.
This is what you have to do.	Le nto kufuneka uyenze.
He said he would do it.	Wathi uya kwenza njalo.
I told you that was a big deal	Ndikuxelele ukuba yinto enkulu leyo
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
He knows where we need to go.	Uyazi apho kufuneka siye khona.
As long as you like.	Ixesha elide njengoko uthanda.
I made my decision	Ndenze isigqibo sam
I can't talk enough about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
And now you expect to know everything.	Kwaye ngoku ulindele ukwazi yonke into.
I had to stay in it.	Bekufanele ndihlale kuyo.
I want to go with you	Ndifuna ukuhamba nawe
I'm sorry it happened.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba kwenzeke.
And so he said nothing.	Kwaye ngoko akazange athethe nto.
I think it will be the first	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba ngowokuqala
I did that early.	Ndenze loo nto kwangethuba.
I hope we did.	Ndiyathemba ukuba senze njalo.
I doubt he will return	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uya kubuya
I have to have you inside of me	Kufuneka ndibe nawe ngaphakathi kum
Not just.	Hayi nje.
I have to have that much	Ndifanele ukuba naloo nto ingako
No, he did not want to talk.	Hayi, wayengafuni kuthetha.
You may have gotten there first.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba ufike apho kuqala.
Then he came home.	Wafika ke ekhaya.
I can't believe what's going on	Andikholelwa ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I did it very quickly.	Ndenze ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
And stop playing with that.	Kwaye yeka ukudlala ngaloo nto.
It would be painful.	Bekuya kuba buhlungu.
I don't know why you think so.	Andazi ukuba kutheni ucinga njalo.
I had no idea that was happening	Ndandingazi ukuba oko kwenzeka
I don't know about that.	Andazi ngalonto.
I can't think of it right now	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo ngoku
I would like to see you tomorrow, if possible	Ndingathanda ukubona ngomso, ukuba kunokwenzeka
Thank you for breakfast.	Enkosi ngesidlo sakusasa.
I know you said you were looking for a job	Ndiyazi ubuthe ufuna umsebenzi
I've always thought of you	Bendisoloko ndicinga ngawe
I wanted to know what was going on	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni
I will be sad soon	Ndiza kuba buhlungu kungekudala
This week can be even more difficult.	Le veki inokuba nzima ngakumbi.
I want to talk to her	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye
I will not take a meal with you.	Andiyi kuthatha isidlo nawe.
And everyone knows it.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyayazi.
He is not here long.	Akakho ixesha elide apha.
You have to move on.	Kufuneka uye phambili.
She is intelligent, and able, and passionate.	Ukrelekrele, kwaye uyakwazi, kwaye unomdla.
But not books.	Kodwa hayi iincwadi.
And then again.	Kwaye emva koko kwakhona.
Now we know this.	Ngoku siyazi oku.
I was thinking about him a lot today	Bendicinga ngaye kakhulu namhlanje
He just loves everything and everything.	Uthanda nje yonke into ngayo yonke into.
You may be doing wrong.	Usenokuba wenza kakubi.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Ngokucacileyo, oku akunjalo.
Not so tomorrow.	Akunjalo ngomso.
Well and really.	Kulungile kwaye ngokwenene.
And then he came forward.	Waza ke weza ngaphambili.
I could not go to you	Andikwazanga ukuya kuwe
No you did not.	Hayi awuzange.
It is unlikely that this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba kwenzeke.
I went immediately.	Ndaya ngoko nangoko.
And money, too.	Kwaye imali, nayo.
I want to be that way	Ndifuna ukuba njalo
For if it is not, there is nothing.	Kuba ukuba akunjalo, akukho nto.
I feel more you and me.	Ndiziva ngakumbi mna nawe.
I'm glad you are.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguwe.
And what do you think ?.	Kwaye ucinga ntoni?.
I did not know it at the time	Ndandingazi ukuba lixesha
I think you want me for you	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna mna ngenxa yam
He told her it was 'him'.	Wamxelela ukuba 'nguye'.
I did not want you to leave	Bendingafuni uhambe
The reason is, he did that before.	Isizathu sokuba, wakwenza oko ngaphambili.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.
I did not know anyone	Ndandingazi mntu
I did not want to be alone	Ndandingafuni ukuba ndedwa
He never left because of me.	Akazange ahambe ngenxa yam.
Long ago he had hope.	Kudala wayenethemba.
I did not look back	Khange ndijonge ngasemva
I did not see him for a long time.	Khange ndimbone ixesha elide.
Then he came to us.	Emva koko weza kuthi.
I wanted to know what he knew.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba wayesazi ntoni.
I like that about it.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngayo.
I wanted to tell you	Bendifuna ukukuxelela
Sorry, that 's a very bad thing to say.	Uxolo, yinto embi kakhulu leyo ukuyithetha.
I never thought of anything else	Andizange ndicinge ngenye into
I've done enough of that lately	Ndenze ngokwaneleyo oko mva nje
I'm sorry about that, of course.	Ndiyaxolisa ngaloo nto, kunjalo.
You will definitely want to talk about this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufuna ukuthetha ngale nto.
I spoke to him yesterday	Ndithethe naye izolo
I had to look hard to see anything	Kwafuneka ndijonge ngamandla ukuze ndibone nantoni na
Or anyone else for that.	Okanye nabani na ngaloo nto.
No one is out.	Akukho namnye ngaphandle.
Look into his eyes.	Jonga amehlo akhe.
But only if you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba uyafuna.
Moreover, he realized that he wanted her to leave.	Ngaphezu koko, waqonda ukuba ufuna ukuba ahambe.
I knew he would be there	Ndandisazi ukuba uzakuba lapho
I couldn’t take much more	Andikwazanga ukuthatha okuninzi ngakumbi
My question is.	Umbuzo wam uthi.
I hope one of us finds one of us	Ndiyathemba ukuba omnye wethu uza kufumana omnye wethu
I could not do such a thing	Andikwazanga ukwenza into enje
Travel is difficult.	Ukuhamba kunzima.
I did something wrong with you	Ndenze into engalunganga ngawe
But not my money.	Kodwa hayi imali yam.
As a father is needed.	Njengoko kufuneka utata.
And sorry about what happened.	Kwaye uxolo ngento eyenzekayo.
Or almost okay.	Okanye phantse ilungile.
I want you to stay with me	Ndifuna uhlala nam
Well, he did just that.	Ewe, wenza kanye loo nto.
I know you know what's going on	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi into eyenzekayo
I hope you have the same problem with us.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe unengxaki efanayo nathi.
I did not know the answer	Bendingayazi impendulo
I wanted to be very high	Ndandifuna ukuba phezulu kakhulu
Such a small thing.	Into encinci enjalo.
I know you're doing it wrong.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyenza kakubi.
It will try.	Iza kuzama.

Very good question here	Umbuzo omhle kakhulu apha

I speak quite badly	Ndithetha kakubi ngokupheleleyo
I'll start working on it tonight.	Ndiza kuqala ukusebenza ngayo ngokuhlwanje.
He would need time, perhaps for a long time.	Wayeza kufuna ixesha, mhlawumbi ixesha elide.
Without you it is.	Ngaphandle kwakho kunjalo.
He’s interesting, and in a whole new way.	Unomdla, kwaye ngendlela entsha ngokupheleleyo.
He did it perfectly.	Wenza ngokupheleleyo.

I didn't want to do this to you	Bendingafuni ukuyenza lento kuwe
I know him through.	Ndiyamazi ngaye.

I have to tell you now.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ngoku.
I don't understand why he wants to do this.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni efuna ukuyenza le nto.
I didn't want to be alone at all	Ndandingafuni tu ukuba ndedwa
He continued to try to get his approval.	Waqhubeka uzama ukufumana imvume yakhe.

He did not agree, however.	Akazange avume, nangona kunjalo.
At the top, it should be easy.	Phezulu, kufuneka kube lula.
I can't find a way in it.	Andikwazi ukufumana indlela kuyo.
It seemed like one.	Kwakubonakala ngathi enye.

I'll get something	Ndiza kufumana into
I can't wait to do this	Andikwazi kulinda ukwenza oku
I told you you did something.	Ndikuxelele ukuba wenze into.
Football, maybe me.	Ibhola, mhlawumbi mna.
I tried again, and again nothing	Ndazama kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona akukho nto
I don't know, nobody.	Andikwazi, akukho namnye umntu.
And to him.	Kwaye kuye.
Unless there is a reason, fine.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho isizathu, kulungile.
You have to tell me one of yours.	Kufuneka undixelele enye yakho.
I will not do that to him	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto kuye
I have to do this alone	Le nto kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa
I don't want to say anything	Andifuni kuthetha nto
One day, another one.	Enye into ngenye imini, enye into enye.
No night, only day.	Akukho ubusuku, imini kuphela.

I didn’t look or do anything else	Khange ndijonge okanye ndenze enye into
Well done !.	Wenze kakuhle !.
All by myself.	Konke ngokwam.
He must try hard.	Kufuneka azame ngamandla.
I want to do something great	Ndifuna ukwenza into enkulu
And that's perfectly fine.	Kwaye oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Probably not in a bad way.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngendlela embi.

Very, very good.	Kuhle kakhulu, kakhulu.
But no, this is better.	Kodwa hayi, oku kungcono.
You won, okay.	Uphumelele, kulungile.

I saw something strange	Ndabona into engaqhelekanga
I hope you are	Ndiyathemba ukuba ukhona
Now look at you.	Ngoku jonga wena.
His first job went wrong	Umsebenzi wakhe wokuqala wahamba kakubi
I am not the only one.	Ayindim kuphela lo.
I know this situation	Ndiyayazi le meko
No one is building a case here.	Akukho mntu wakha ityala apha.
Outside, he has been very successful.	Ngaphandle, uphumelele kakhulu.
If it is true, something must be done and done immediately.	Ukuba yinyani, into kufuneka yenziwe kwaye yenziwe ngokukhawuleza.
But then again, probably not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.

He is interested in me.	Unomdla kum.
I wanted to talk	Bendifuna ukuthetha
I'm trying to do just that	Ndizama ukwenza loo nto kanye
Then we will see what happens.	Emva koko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.

I want you with everything I have	Ndifuna wena ngayo yonke into yam
So, it is not.	Ngoko, akunjalo.
It will be difficult, though.	Uya kuba nzima, nangona kunjalo.
Finally he spoke softly.	Ekugqibeleni wathetha kancinci.
I don't know where my shirt is	Andazi ukuba iphi ihempe yam
I feel like you can read my mind	Ndiziva ngathi uyakwazi ukufunda ingqondo yam
I did it the other way	Ndenze ngenye indlela
Go to the house.	Iya endlini.
There is little to do.	Kukho kancinci ukwenza.
Certainly, this is exactly what happened to me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kum.
I thought he would succeed.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kuphumelela.
But that would be difficult.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuba nzima.
I could not go to school	Andikwazanga ukuya esikolweni
She is very happy about this though.	Uyavuya kakhulu yile nto nangona.
I did not know why	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni
I don't know what happened to him	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye
I never heard of him	Zange ndive ngaye
He never did this.	Akazange ayenze le nto.
He will return again.	Uya kubuya kwakhona.
Or almost none.	Okanye phantse akukho.
I can't believe you already have a place to stay	Andikholelwa ukuba sele unayo indawo yokuhlala
Maybe he won't come back for hours.	Mhlawumbi akayi kubuya iiyure.
True, as you will see.	Yinyani, njengoko uza kubona kakuhle.
The man to whom he was speaking appeared.	Wabonakala umntu lowo ethetha naye.
No one said anything to me.	Akukho mntu wathetha nto kum.
I couldn’t work hard enough or fast enough	Andikwazanga ukusebenza nzima ngokwaneleyo okanye ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo
I know what you want to do	Ndiyayazi into ofuna ukuyenza
Then go there.	Uze uhambe apho.
But in doing so it seems like nothing.	Kodwa ekwenzeni oko kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
I did not say another word	Khange ndithethe elinye igama
Maybe right.	Mhlawumbi ilungile.
I wanted something small, but not too small.	Ndandifuna into encinci, kodwa hayi encinci kakhulu.
That goes on for a few days.	Oko kuqhubeka iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Then, when the police.	Emva koko, xa amapolisa .
I think you should go	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uhambe
I read a book recently	Ndifunde incwadi mva nje

Very good time.	Ixesha elihle kakhulu.
I never thought why	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kutheni
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.

So, my question remains the same.	Ngoko, umbuzo wam uhlala ufana.
If you want to read.	Ukuba ufuna ukufunda.
So my question.	Ngoko umbuzo wam.

I know this place	Ndiyayazi le ndawo
I will sit here next to him	Ndiza kuhlala apha ecaleni kwakhe
If performance goes well.	Ukuba ukusebenza kuhamba kakuhle.
He went out and came in.	Waphuma wangena.
I know it back then.	Ndiyayazi emva.
Almost and go.	Phantse kwaye uhambe.

Everything is moving forward.	Yonke into iya phambili.
I have to think things through	Kufuneka ndicinge kakuhle izinto
I have to be with him now.	Kufuneka ndibe naye ngoku.

And you need to know your location.	Kwaye kufuneka uyazi indawo yakho.
I had no idea why this was	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni le nto
Maybe you're right.	Mhlawumbi ulungile.
I want our time together first	Ndifuna ixesha lethu kunye kuqala
I did not go with him.	Khange ndihambe naye.
I did not hear anything.	Khange ndive nto.
It is difficult but impossible.	Kunzima kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Just a little bit.	Kancinci nje kancinci.
I will never get home.	Soze ndifike ekhaya.
I think you are here now	Ndicinga ukuba ukhona ngoku

I had no idea you were there	Bendingazi ukuba ukhona
He never read my thing.	Akazange afunde nto yam.
I like the place in this place	Ndiyayithanda indawo kule ndawo

To see who will go first.	Ukubona ukuba ngubani oza kuhamba kuqala.

Maybe it will be tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba kusasa.
I think you have spoken enough	Ndicinga ukuba uthethe ngokwaneleyo
He wanted to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthetha.
Making a small speech is very difficult for me.	Ukwenza intetho encinci kunzima kakhulu kum.
I'm tired of everyone	Ndidiniwe ngumntu wonke
I'm doing the right thing here	Ndenza into elungileyo apha
Someone else did that	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto
I don't see where the problem is.	Andiboni apho ingxaki.
I want you to look at others	Ndifuna ujonge abanye
I wish I was here only for you	Ndinqwenela ukuba lapha kuwe kuphela
I hope you wish it so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba unqwenela ukuba kube njalo.

And you know more than that.	Kwaye wazi ngaphezu koko.

He's here now, and there's plenty of time.	Ulapha ngoku, kwaye kukho ixesha elininzi.
A woman should eat well	Umfazi umele atye kakuhle
The doctor could not help.	Ugqirha akazange akwazi ukunceda.
I would like to know his response	Ndingathanda ukwazi impendulo yakhe
And make sure you have it.	Kwaye wenze ukuba unayo.
I think it is possible	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka
I wonder if she is okay	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ulungile na
Nothing about him.	Akukho nto ngaye.
I did this last night	Ndenze le phezolo
I may be doing the right thing	Inokuba ndenza into elungileyo
Tell me how you can do it.	Ndixelele ukuba ungayenza njani.
I didn't really know why	Ndandingazi ngokwenene ukuba kutheni
I'm glad to find 'someone' to go with me again.	Ndiyavuya ukufumana 'umntu' oza kuhamba naye kwakhona.
He didn't even know there was another one.	Wayengazi nokuba kukho enye.
I have to go just a little bit	Kufuneka ndihambe nje kancinci
Or to try another.	Okanye ukuzama enye.
He would not make any money out of it.	Wayengayi kwenza nayiphi na imali kuyo.
I think that's right	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile loo nto
I didn’t want to try a bit	Bendingafuni kuzama kancinci
Unless he is.	Ngaphandle kokuba ayinguye.
We did nothing at all.	Asizange senze nto kwaphela.
I think it will always be that way	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuhlala kunjalo
Did you know.	Ubusazi.
How would it be.	Bekuya kuba njani.
This takes time and is not fun.	Oku kuthatha ixesha kwaye akukho mnandi.
Finally he left.	Ekugqibeleni wemka.
In the end, he said nothing.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange athethe nto.
It didn't have to be that way.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba kube njalo.
Not much here.	Akukho kakhulu apha.
He just loves to play.	Uthanda nje ukudlala.
Look even better.	Jonga ngcono kakhulu.
I don't want to do that	Andifuni ukuyenza loo nto
I could not see his name	Andizange ndikwazi ukubona igama lakhe
Where you at?.	Ingaba uphi?.
I didn't really want to talk to her now	Bendingafuni nyani ukuthetha naye ngoku
I've only been here for three weeks today.	Ndilapha nje iiveki ezintathu namhlanje.
I had to think about everything	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngayo yonke into
I didn't hear anything about it	Khange ndive nto ngalonto
However that only happens once.	Nangona kunjalo oko kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
I can't wait to leave here.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuba ndihambe apha.
There are police everywhere.	Kukho amapolisa kuyo yonke indawo.
I had no idea you liked something like this	Bendingayazi ukuba uyayithanda into enje
He did not make his own money.	Akazange enze imali yakhe yedwa.
I feel better though	Ndiziva ngcono kodwa
Yes, you have come to the right place.	Ewe, ufike kwindawo elungileyo.
He will have to try again.	Kuya kufuneka azame kwakhona.
Maybe it will be a good thing.	Mhlawumbi iya kuba yinto elungileyo.
That would have been much easier.	Oko bekuya kuba lula kakhulu.
I have to talk to her before she leaves.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye phambi kokuba ahambe.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Mhlawumbi kancinci, mhlawumbi kakhulu.

I didn't want to be down	Ndandingafuni ukuba phantsi
However, you cannot do it.	Nangona kunjalo, awukwazi ukuyenza.
He stayed longer than he had hoped.	Wahlala ixesha elide kunokuba wayenethemba.
But who else.	Kodwa ngubani omnye .
But there is another problem.	Kodwa ke kukho enye ingxaki.
Being human is hard, and it will be hard.	Ukuba ngumntu kunzima, kwaye kuya kuba nzima.

I have long wished	Kudala ndinqwenela

I would like to be here.	Ndingathanda ukuba lapha.
However, this is not true yet.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akukho nyani kodwa.

It is time for us to act.	Lixesha lokuba senze.
I knew he would be here	Bendisazi ukuba uzakuba lapha

I sit down hard.	Ndihlala phantsi kunzima.
I know what happened	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekileyo
Otherwise, it will be very difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
I am very sorry for what happened	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngento eyenzekileyo
There was no way at all.	Kwakungekho ndlela kwaphela.
We just need more time.	Sifuna nje ixesha elingakumbi.
Then, little by little, he could not.	Emva koko, kancinci kancinci, akazange akwazi.
I know you want this.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna oku.
It has to happen soon today.	Kumele kwenzeke kwangoko namhlanje.
I wanted to spend more time with her	Ndandifuna ixesha elingakumbi kunye naye
No problem at this time.	Akukho ngxaki ngeli xesha.
I didn't want to think about anything bad happening	Ndandingafuni ukucinga ngento embi eyenzekayo
But he did not think it would happen here.	Kodwa akazange acinge ukuba kuya kwenzeka apha.
For me, it's better.	Kum, kungcono.
So it is very difficult.	Ngoko kunzima kakhulu.
I want something better.	Ndifuna into engcono.
He will say yes, and it will be so.	Uya kuthi ewe, kwaye kuya kuba njalo.
He wants to do it.	Ufuna ukwenza.
Or because it is necessary.	Okanye ngenxa yokuba kufuneka.
Lots of food.	Ukutya okuninzi.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha lixesha.
That's a good thing.	Nantso into elungileyo.
What happened.	Ngaba kwenzeka ntoni.
I went well today.	Ndihambe kakuhle namhlanje.
Then one.	Emva koko omnye.
I could not do anything else	Andikwazanga ukwenza enye into
I look at others.	Ndijonge abanye.
No accident, nothing.	Akukho ngozi, akukho nto.
I wanted to be his friend again.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe kwakhona.
He wondered how they could do that.	Wayecinga ukuba baza kuyenza njani loo nto.
I did not wait.	Khange ndilinde.
And there is no time.	Kwaye akukho xesha.
But we will do that later.	Kodwa siya kuyenza loo nto kamva.
Where is it.	Iphi.
I can't say anything else.	Andikwazi ukuthetha enye into.
He asked for help from her.	Wacela uncedo kuye.
He spent a few hours on it.	Wachitha iiyure ezimbalwa kuyo.
I will always do that	Ndiya kukwenza oko rhoqo
He always appears.	Ubonakala rhoqo.
Maybe you should go now.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhambe ngoku.
Someone has to do another job	Omnye umntu kufuneka enze omnye umsebenzi
He who does.	Lowo wenza.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngamandla.
That would be the same thing.	Oko bekuya kuba yinto enye.
Everything about him.	Yonke into ngaye.
I want to be human again	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu kwakhona
I can't stop thinking about what happened	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngale nto yenzekileyo
I want to talk to you alone	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe wedwa
He learned a lot that way.	Wafunda okuninzi ngaloo ndlela.
Or are you there ?.	Okanye ukhona?.
He would not stay long.	Wayengayi kuhlala ixesha elide.
That's good.	Ilungile lonto.
So we had to make a decision.	Ngoko kwafuneka senze isigqibo ngaloo nto.
The woman died.	Wafa umfazi.
I do not know at all	Andazi kwaphela
He says it's hard, but it will happen.	Uthi kunzima, kodwa kuya kwenzeka.
I hope you will	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuyenza
I don't think you should	Ndicinga ukuba akufanele
I know how you must have felt.	Ndiyazi ukuba unokuba waziva njani.
There is a time when you have realized.	Kukho ixesha apho uye waqonda.
I wanted to help everyone	Ndandifuna ukunceda wonke umntu
I think he doesn't have to	Ndicinga ukuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba enjenjalo
I just wanted to talk to him	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha naye
I had to leave immediately	Kwafuneka ndihambe ngokukhawuleza
What a wonderful way then.	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ke ngoko.
I think we will have it the same way	Ndicinga ukuba siya kuba nayo ngendlela efanayo
This, right here.	Oku, kanye apha.
I think you can do it	Ndicinga ukuba ungayenza
And let me just do it this way.	Kwaye mandiyenze nje ngale ndlela.
I can't stay away from you	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude nawe
I think you are tired	Ndicinga ukuba udiniwe
I apologized immediately.	Ndacela uxolo ngoko nangoko.
I do not want to talk	Andifuni kuthetha
You will have to tell me the truth.	Kuya kufuneka undixelele inyani.
He was afraid of everything.	Wayesoyika yonke into.
The doctor did not do that.	Ugqirha akenzanga njalo.
I did not want you to be alone	Bendingafuni ube wedwa
I like it a little bit	Ndiyayithanda kancinci
Then he saw.	Emva koko wabona.
Error or not.	Impazamo okanye hayi.
I have to talk to him alone	Kufuneka ndithethe naye yedwa
I wanted to quit that morning	Ndandifuna ukuyeka ngaloo ntsasa
So you never know how it might have happened.	Ngoko awukwazi ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Maybe he didn’t do it fast enough.	Mhlawumbi akazange ayenze ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
I talk a lot about work	Ndithetha kakhulu ngomsebenzi
He did not tell her anything.	Akazange amxelele nto.
I want to be a doctor like you	Ndifuna ukuba ngugqirha njengawe
I had no idea what it was	Bendingayazi ukuba yintoni
But surely everyone knows that.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
I want it done immediately please	Ndifuna yenziwe kwangoko nceda
Give me just one coin.	Ndinike imali enye nje.
I don't see anything about him	Andiboni nto ngaye
Maybe I will never do it again	Mhlawumbi andisayi kuphinda
Clearly, that is exactly what happened.	Ngokucacileyo, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I can't live here without you	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha ngaphandle kwakho
He said it was possible.	Wathi kunokwenzeka.
One day you will know.	Ngenye imini uya kukwazi.
A little something for you	Into encinci kuwe
I thought so.	Ndicinge njalo.
Eventually, he became a man.	Ekugqibeleni, waba yindoda.
You don't want that to be the case.	Awufuni ukuba kube njalo.
But he wondered.	Kodwa wazibuza.
But I can't do that.	Kodwa andikwazi ukwenjenjalo.
Tell me your story.	Ndixelele ibali lakho.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele.
What are you doing.	Wenza ntoni na.
But there was no way out of it.	Kodwa kwakungekho ukuphuma kuyo.
Two weeks, three very.	Iiveki ezimbini, ezintathu kakhulu.
But he went and asked for a job.	Kodwa waya wacela umsebenzi.
I saw a lot of people in that area	Ndabona abantu abaninzi kuloo ndawo
This is not going to be fun.	Oku akuyi kuba mnandi.
I both went to school	Ndaya esikolweni sobabini
I do not remember before	Andikhumbuli ngaphambili
Then he understood how long.	Waqonda ke ngoko ukuba kude kube nini.
Then I thought.	Ndiye ndacinga.
It will definitely repeat.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuphinda.
I want to see my mom, badly	Ndifuna ukubona umama wam, kakubi
I think that sounds good	Ndicinga ukuba oko kubonakala kulungile
He does not always think so.	Akacingi njalo.
We have to go with him.	Kufuneka sihambe naye.
I can't wait to meet you	Andikwazi kulinda ukudibana nawe
We want to know.	Sifuna ukwazi.
I feel it now.	Ndive ngoku.
Everyone wants one.	Wonke umntu ufuna enye.
He did not always come here.	Akazange eze rhoqo apha.
He did this, and he did it.	Wenza oku, naye wakwenza.
The marriage did not last long.	Umtshato awuzange uhlale ixesha elide.
He will be back now.	Uza kubuya ngoku.
I always thought so.	Bendisoloko ndicinga njalo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze oko ukwenza ngcono.
You may be joking, but he never thought of it that way.	Inokuba udlala naye, kodwa akazange acinge njalo.
You are working on this book.	Usebenza kule ncwadi.
I also did not feel bad	Nam andizange ndive kakubi
I certainly did not want to end that way	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni ukugqiba ngolo hlobo
But now all his work is yours.	Kodwa ngoku umsebenzi wakhe wonke nguwe.
You're just scared.	Uyoyika nje.
You have to stay in it.	Kufuneka uhlale kuyo.
I will be right next to you	Ndiza kuba kanye ecaleni kwakho
He plays good football.	Udlala ibhola entle.
He has looked at you.	Uye wajonga kuwe.
He thought it was too good.	Wayecinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
I want you to stay there	Ndifuna uhlale phaya
I hope it will come back	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kubuya
I thought about it a lot	Ndacinga ngayo kakhulu
Everything is made of energy.	Yonke into yenziwe ngamandla.
He knew he could do it.	Wayesazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
You're just fine.	Ulungile nje.
But I don't know how I did it.	Kodwa andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
I can't do without him, either	Andikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe, nam
But you may have something.	Kodwa usenokuba unayo into.
I can't do that now	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto ngoku
I wanted to know what was going on.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Night or day.	Ubusuku okanye imini.
And then he did something strange.	Kwaye ke wenza into engaqhelekanga.
I will not be away very often	Andiyi kuba kude rhoqo
I wonder if he is here	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba ulapha
It will take another few hours.	Kuya kuthatha ezinye iiyure ezimbalwa.
He said he did.	Wathi wenza.
I saw something in you	Ndibone into kuwe
I'll take your phone.	Ndiza kuthatha ifowuni yakho.
I pretend not to see	Ndenza ngathi andiboni
I wish you were here to be with us.	Ndinqwenela ukuba ube lapha ukuze ube kunye nathi.
Or the way.	Okanye indlela.
I think we need to do it sooner	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze ngokukhawuleza
I did not know why.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni.
I can't have it my way	Andikwazi ukuba nayo ngendlela yam
It's good to be there.	Kulungile ukuba ube khona.
I feel very bad.	Ndiziva kakubi kakhulu.
I think you should go with me	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono uhambe nam
I want to do something	Ndifuna ukwenza into
As you will be.	Njengoko uya kuba njalo.
I heard rather than see	Ndeva kunokuba ndibone
Everything seemed clear to him.	Konke kwakubonakala kucacile kuye.
If you really want to.	Ukuba ufuna ngokwenene.
Not outside.	Akukho ngaphandle.
I never saw him in it	Andizange ndimbone kuyo
And he stayed in that place for hours.	Kwaye wahlala kwindawo iiyure ezininzi.
I could not say anything	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto
I never went to that place	Andizange ndiye kuloo ndawo
He did not really agree.	Akazange avume ncam.
He has spoken more.	Uye wathetha ngakumbi.
We will need many things.	Siza kufuna izinto ezininzi.
I want you to go now	Ndifuna uhamba ngoku
It has not been easy.	Ayizange yenzeke lula.
He would have to do it now.	Bekuya kufuneka enze ngoku.
You, me, everyone.	Wena, mna, wonke umntu.
I want you there too	Ndifuna wena apho nam
I can't say it though	Andikwazi ukuyithetha kodwa
I wanted this, whatever it was	Ndandifuna oku, nokuba yintoni na
Then I thought.	Ndiye ndacinga .
It means you want to succeed.	Kuthetha ukuba ufuna ukuphumelela.
You’ve said something, though.	Ukhe wathetha into, nangona kunjalo.
I want to go shopping	Ndifuna ukuya kuthenga
We'll find someone else.	Siza kufumana omnye umntu.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngayo.
I don't even know what happened.	Andazi nokuba kwenzeke ntoni.
You look good enough.	Ubonakala ulungile ngokwaneleyo.
That's every day.	Yiyo yonke imihla.
He is here to stay.	Ulapha ukuba uhlale.
It is new and ugly.	Yinto entsha kwaye embi.
It has to be later.	Kufuneka kube kamva.
Here is the book.	Nantso ke incwadi.
I don't know what my problem is	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yam
And, of course not.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
I do not remember there.	Andikhumbuli apho.
I thought later.	Ndacinga kamva.
But we will do well.	Kodwa siya kwenza kakuhle.
He can't go home.	Akakwazi ukuya ekhaya.
I mean, everything	Ndithetha, yonke into
A little more, he thought	Kancinci ngakumbi, wacinga
I don't know what's going on here.	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apha.
We only need to do it for one week.	Kufuneka siyenze iveki enye kuphela.
My wife agreed.	Umfazi wam wavuma.
I could not do anything.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nantoni na.
But, in the end, it will happen.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, kuya kwenzeka.
I really want you, too	Ndifuna ngokwenene wena, nam
I thought for a long time and it was hard to come here	Ndacinga ixesha elide kwaye kunzima ukuza apha
I wanted to go there	Bendifuna ukuya khona
He hoped that that would happen soon.	Wayenethemba lokuba oko kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
To end death.	Ukugqiba ukufa.
I never thought it would be me.	Zange ndicinge ukuba iya kuba ndim.
All right now, that's it.	Kulungile ngoku, yiloo nto.
I would like to do it	Ndingathanda ukuyenza
I could not do this on my own	Andikwazanga ukwenza oku ngokwam
Then it will be difficult.	Emva koko kuya kuba nzima.
I want you to tell me everything	Ndifuna undixelele yonke into
Either way.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela.
I know it will happen	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka
Doctor or person.	Ugqirha okanye umntu .
He has to tell everything.	Kufuneka axelele yonke into.
I have to wait until tomorrow	Kufuneka ndilinde kude kube ngomso
And yes, they will know about it.	Kwaye ewe, baya kukwazi ngayo.
That seems obvious.	Oko kubonakala kucacile.
He was thinking of one thing clearly.	Wayecinga into enye ngokucacileyo.
A few hours or something.	Iiyure ezimbalwa okanye enye into.
I just had to be with him	Kwafuneka nje ndibe naye
And something very unusual happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into entsha kakhulu.
And there is one almost every day.	Kwaye kukho enye phantse yonke imihla.
I know her and she knows it too	Ndiyayazi kwaye naye uyayazi
I like that about it	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngayo
A picture or a book.	Umfanekiso okanye incwadi.
It makes our job very difficult.	Kwenza umsebenzi wethu ube nzima kakhulu.
There is another way, though.	Kukho enye indlela, nangona kunjalo.
He said he just did it.	Wathi uyenzile nje.
I saw no other way.	Khange ndibone enye indlela.
And mom.	Kwaye umama.
And maybe not for long.	Kwaye mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
They will get it.	Baya kufumana.
For a very long time indeed	Ixesha elide kakhulu ngokwenene
Help me do that.	Ndincede ndenze oko.
I did not learn much from it	Andizange ndifunde okuninzi kuyo
However, this is not really the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
You and me.	Mna nawe.
I didn’t know, though.	Ndandingazi, nangona kunjalo.
That should be the case with me.	Kumele ukuba kube njalo kum.
I knew he wanted to do other things	Ndandisazi ukuba wayefuna ukwenza ezinye izinto
This is all new music.	Lo wonke umculo omtsha.
Not my mother.	Hayi umama wam.

I had no idea what the problem was	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki
I think we will go with it	Ndicinga ukuba siza kuhamba nayo
I'm glad you like it	Ndiyavuya uyayithanda
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
My decision.	Isigqibo sam.
I do not understand why this is so.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni oku kunjalo.
Look at something else.	Jonga enye into.
As soon as possible.	Ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
I do not believe in such a thing.	Andikholelwa into enjalo.
This is a job.	Ngumsebenzi lo.
Now, at last, I can go to school	Ngoku, ekugqibeleni, ndiyakwazi ukuya esikolweni
It is not necessary, however.	Akukho mfuneko, nangona kunjalo.
In general.	Nje.
I thought it was weird.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
I know the restaurant	Ndiyayazi indawo yokutyela
We want to be here.	Sifuna ukuba lapha.
I can't wait all night	Andikwazi kulinda ubusuku bonke
I mean the truth	Ndithetha inyani
All work.	Umsebenzi wonke.
He asked me questions.	Wandibuza imibuzo.
And you will go far.	Kwaye uya kude.
At first it seems so.	Ekuqaleni kubonakala kunjalo.
He said he didn't know much about it.	Wathi akazi kakhulu ngayo.
I know it's hard for him	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kuye

Asiyi.	Asiyi .
I just want him to know that that's true	Ndifuna nje ukuba azi ukuba yinyani leyo
Nothing like this has ever happened to me.	Ayizange yenzeke into enje apha kwam.
I did not know how long that would continue	Ndandingazi ukuba uza kuqhubeka ixesha elingakanani na loo nto
You could be.	Usenokuba njalo.
Or tomorrow morning.	Okanye ngomso kusasa.
I will not talk too much about this	Andiyi kuthetha kakhulu ngale nto
He said no, and left.	Wathi hayi, wahamba.
We didn't go very far.	Asizange sihambe kakhulu.
You can certainly do it.	Ungayenza ngokuqinisekileyo.
I have to say something quickly	Kufuneka ndithethe into ngokukhawuleza
My wife told me to do it.	Umfazi wam wandixelela ukuba ndenze njalo.
Many children.	Abantwana abaninzi.
Not the others.	Hayi abanye.
Walking this morning.	Ukuhamba ngale ntsasa.
It will be much easier to stop.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukuyeka.
I'm just a little bit.	Ndim nje kancinci.

About him.	Ngaye.
I want to finish my book	Ndifuna ukugqiba incwadi yam
I thought she would get better	Bendicinga uzakuba ngcono
Yes, you did well.	Ewe, uyenzile kakuhle.
Now it will be a thing.	Ngoku iya kuba yinto.
There was no one, though.	Kwakungekho mntu, nangona kunjalo.
He is moving fast.	Uhamba ngokukhawuleza.
You feel like you can't walk properly.	Uziva ngathi awukwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
There is no such situation here.	Apha akukho meko enjalo.
He works hard, and he does better.	Usebenza nzima, kwaye wenza ngcono.
I did not look good.	Khange ndijonge kakuhle.
So, he does not know how it happened.	Ngoko, akazi ukuba kwenzeke njani.
And yet, suddenly.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, ngokukhawuleza.
I have to do something	Kufuneka ndenze into
This can be a little painful.	Oku kunokuba buhlungu kancinci.
Also, do not eat too fast.	Kwaye, musa ukutya ngokukhawuleza.
I have to tell you we need more time	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ukuba sifuna ixesha elingakumbi
There was nothing to be in town.	Kwakungekho nto inokuba nayo edolophini.
He is very much like me.	Ufana nam kakhulu.

I think he is not at home	Ndicinga ukuba akakho ekhaya
He didn't know much.	Wayengazi kakhulu.
I don't know what to do.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni.
I had no idea when he would do it again.	Ndandingazi ukuba uya kuyenza nini kwakhona.
I have to tell you.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele.
I don't like it now.	Andiyithandi ngoku.
Everything is fine for me.	Yonke into ilungile kum.
He sat down for lunch.	Wahlala ngesidlo sasemini.
I ended up playing with me	Ndagqiba udlala ngam
I think you better go here	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono uye apha
How to do it.	Indlela yokwenza.
This will take a long time, to complete everything.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha elide, ukugqiba yonke into.
At the moment he just asked.	Okwangoku wabuza nje.
To speak a word.	Ukuze athethe ilizwi.
I know all about him	Ndiyazi konke ngaye
And it could be anyone.	Kwaye inokuba ngubani.
I just really want to know	Ndifuna nje ngokwenene ukwazi
No one should try	Akukho mntu kufuneka azame
I knew he was coming back	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kubuya
But this is my baby.	Kodwa ngumntwana wam lo.
There was no one at home anymore.	Kwakungekho mntu ekhaya kwakhona.
And I never looked back.	Kwaye andizange ndijonge ngasemva.
You have lunch with friends.	Utya isidlo sasemini nabahlobo.
I think she is beautiful	Ndicinga ukuba mhle
Or maybe he would have been hurt.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayeza kuba buhlungu.
Or he tried.	Okanye wazama.
I don't know why there	Andazi ukuba kutheni apho
But it will definitely be here longer than anyone wants.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuba apha ixesha elide kunokuba nabani na ufuna.
I didn't want you to know.	Bendingafuni uyazi.
That's what he wants to do.	Yiloo nto afuna ukuyenza.
This is not really the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
He wants to help us.	Ufuna ukusinceda.
I can't do this, not this way	Andikwazi ukwenza oku, hayi ngolu hlobo
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo.
I told her a lot about it	Ndimxelele kakhulu ngayo
I can do that at home	Ndingayenza lonto ekhaya
Some will be hurt.	Abanye baya kuba buhlungu.
My mom probably, but not my dad.	Umama wam mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi utata wam.
They say nothing.	Bathi akukho nto.
I did not know how long	Ndandingazi ukuba kude kube nini
You may have a problem.	Usenokuba unengxaki.
Probably nothing in it.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto kuyo.
I should not have done that	Akufunekanga ndiyenze loo nto
He did not eat anything during the day.	Akazange atye enye into imini yonke.

Everyone is too tall.	Wonke umntu mde kakhulu.
I did not want to go further	Ndandingafuni ukuya ngaphambili
He stayed there many days.	Wahlala khona iintsuku ezininzi.
His mind, too.	Ingqondo yakhe, nayo.
This wasn’t really hard, but it was hard.	Oku kwakungekho nzima ngokwenene, kodwa kunzima.
We certainly should.	Ngokuqinisekileyo sifanele.
You don't have to come.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uze.
He said something.	Wathetha into.
Not so again.	Akunjalo kwakhona.
I wanted to see more	Ndandifuna ukubona ngakumbi
And he told me.	Uye wandixelela ke.
I can't work without him	Andikwazi ukusebenza ngaphandle kwakhe
I would like to go with you	Ndingathanda ukuhamba nawe
I want to be there.	Ndifuna ukuba lapho.
This means other people besides him.	Oku kuthetha abanye abantu ngaphandle kwakhe.
I want to be like that for you	Ndifuna ukuba njalo kuwe
So that's fine.	Ngoko kulungile.
I want to go alone	Ndifuna ukuhamba ndedwa

I did not know why at that time.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni ngelo xesha.
See what you think.	Jonga ukuba ucinga ntoni.
And, but he never left.	Kwaye, kodwa akazange ahambe.
I think you're kidding us	Ndicinga ukuba udlala ngathi
I did not want money	Ndandingafuni mali
But the truth is the truth.	Kodwa inyaniso yinyani.
I want you to tell her	Ndifuna umxelele
I could not tell you how	Andikwazanga ukukuxelela ukuba njani
I had no idea he was going to do that	Ndandingazi ukuba uza kuyenza loo nto
I'll be back.	Ndiya kubuya.
Now there are two.	Ngoku kukho ezimbini.
And his answer.	Kwaye impendulo yakhe.
So it's hard to tell.	Ngoko ke kunzima ukuxelela.
And anyone does.	Kwaye nabani na wenza.
I arrived at the hospital.	Ndifike esibhedlele.
I really wanted to help you	Bendifuna ngokwenene ukukunceda
I will always do all that	Ndiya kuhlala ndiyenza yonke loo nto
This continues to be difficult.	Oku kuqhubeka kunzima.

I wanted to be an adult	Ndandifuna ukuba mdala
I look at it.	Ndijonge kuyo.
I never thought they would really do that	Andizange ndicinge ukuba baya kuyenza ngokwenene loo nto
It's really hard.	Ngokwenene kunzima ngokwenene.

We have done that a lot.	Senze loo nto kakhulu.
I want to help people.	Ndifuna ukunceda abantu.
I think about everything	Ndicinga ngayo yonke into
He can do anything perfectly.	Uyakwazi ukwenza nantoni na ngokupheleleyo.
You do not have to know.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wazi.
Once upon a time.	Kwakhe kwakho.
I can't tell.	Andikwazi ukuxelela.
I could not sit down in class	Khange ndikwazi ukuhlala phantsi eklasini
I didn't even know that was a good thing	Ndandingazi nokuba yinto entle leyo
I look down and try to think.	Ndijonge phantsi kwaye ndizama ukucinga.
And he doesn't want to now.	Kwaye akafuni ngoku.
Obviously not recently.	Ngokucacileyo hayi mva nje.
It can be difficult to stay with him	Kunokuba nzima ukuhlala naye
I finished a long time ago	Ndagqiba kudala
But then something happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka enye into.

I hope it is not that far away	Ndiyathemba ukuba akukho kude kangako
Look at the big picture and talk.	Jonga umfanekiso omkhulu kwaye uthethe.
My wife can't talk enough about it.	Umfazi wam akakwazi kuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
But it's done.	Kodwa yenziwe.
Down with him himself.	Phantsi naye ngokwakhe.
I know it's not that easy.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
Everyone else will stay outside.	Bonke abanye baya kuhlala ngaphandle.
I didn’t know you were scared	Bendingazi ukuba uyoyika
I did not see him all day	Khange ndimbone imini yonke
Everyone must agree.	Wonke umntu kufuneka avume.
Not mine, of course.	Hayi yam, kunjalo.
I went very fast	Ndiye ngokukhawuleza ngokukhawuleza
But not entirely out.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo ngaphandle.
I thought it would always be that way	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuhlala kunjalo
And it's hard to make it right.	Kwaye kunzima ukuyenza ilungile.
There seems to be room and time.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho indawo kunye nexesha.
And he did.	Kwaye wenze.
The big problem, only today	Ingxaki enkulu, namhlanje kuphela
I went to him but he ran away	Ndiye ndaya kuye kodwa wabaleka

That said, it will get better.	Oko kuthetha, kuya kuba ngcono.
As, really, very good.	Njengoko, ngokwenene, kuhle kakhulu.

I think you love her	Ndicinga ukuba uyamthanda

I couldn't control myself in bed	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ebhedini
He lives there.	Uhlala apho.
I've never heard of this before.	Andizange ndive ngayo ngaphambili oku.
Everyone wants to be your friend.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
Where did he go?	Uhambe waya phi.
That will be much easier.	Oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.

I will not wait any longer	Andisayi kuphinda ndilinde
Even at night.	Nokuba ubusuku.

I think he was very scared	Ndicinga ukuba wayesoyika kakhulu
I can't speak well enough about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakuhle ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
Maybe so, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo, mhlawumbi akunjalo.

You will not have one.	Awuyi kuba nayo enye.
I just don't know who he is.	Andazi nje ukuba ngubani.
She doesn't want to talk to me anymore.	Akafuni kuphinda athethe nam.
This time he will do so.	Ngeli xesha uya kwenza njalo.
I think you should just talk to him	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uthethe naye kuphela

I can't talk about it right now	Andikwazi kuthetha ngayo ngoku
Every day, the same thing.	Yonke imihla, into enye.
But he needs to know better.	Kodwa kufuneka azi ngcono.
And so, from then on, there will always be two.	Kwaye ke, ukusukela ngoko ukuya phambili, kuya kuhlala kukho ezimbini.
Finally, he entered.	Ekugqibeleni, wangena.
One more thing at all.	Enye into ngokupheleleyo.

I think you will be more successful.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kuphumelela ngakumbi.
And you should not go alone.	Kwaye akufanele uhambe wedwa.
Everyone knows everything about everyone.	Wonke umntu uyazi yonke into ngaye wonke umntu.
He started to move forward.	Waqalisa ukuya phambili.
There is something else, though.	Kukho enye into, nangona kunjalo.

It can be a good thing.	Inokuba yinto entle.
He did not know but he was hopeful.	Wayengazi kodwa wayenethemba.
I'm looking for a way out.	Ndijonge ukuhamba indlela.
It doesn't matter to me one way or the other.	Asiyonto kum ngenye indlela okanye enye.
I can't imagine how difficult it would be right now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba bekuya kuba nzima kangakanani ngoku.
So that's true.	Ngoko yinyani leyo.
He is like me.	Ufana nam.
I haven't looked yet	Khange ndijonge okwangoku
Years if you want longer.	Iminyaka ukuba ufuna ixesha elide.
Or, more specifically, a person.	Okanye, ngakumbi, umntu.

I think you should meet him	Ndicinga ukuba ufanele ukudibana naye
I also apologize	Nam ndicela uxolo
Look like me.	Jonga njengam.
Will you try?	Ngaba uza kuzama?
I did not stay overnight in that place.	Andizange ndihlale ubusuku kuloo ndawo.
Little did I know that such a thing would happen	Ndandingazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka into enje
I don't think it's impossible to do that.	Andiqondi ukuba akunakwenzeka ukwenza oko.
To everyone? 	Kuye wonke umntu?
He said he couldn't do that.	Wathi akanakuyenza loo nto.
This is not the case.	Ayinguye lo.
I just tried to be nice to her	Ndazama kuphela ukuba mhle kuye
Again thank you !!.	Kwakhona enkosi!!.
I only wanted two more	Ndandifuna ezinye ezimbini kuphela
I wonder why he is here	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni elapha

I don't care who he is or how he got here.	Andikhathali nokuba ngubani okanye ufike njani apha.

Nobody likes that.	Akukho mntu uthanda loo nto.
You should definitely come tomorrow.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka uze ngomso.

I did not really want to go	Ndandingafuni nyani ukuhamba

I should not have done anything	Bekungafanelanga ndenze nto tu

He knew he wasn't thinking right.	Wayesazi ukuba akacingi kakuhle.
But not like me.	Kodwa hayi njengam.
Not better, not more.	Hayi ngcono, hayi ngakumbi.

I do not know where	Andazi apho
I never thought it would be so but it really is	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo kodwa ngokwenene kunjalo

The whole book.	Incwadi yonke.
A dog, of course.	Inja, kunjalo.

Soon he fell asleep.	Akuzange kube kudala walala.

I like that too.	Nam ndiyayithanda loo nto.
All living.	Ukuhlala konke.
It's just a bad thing.	Yinto embi nje.

I hope nothing happened	Ndiyathemba ukuba akukho nto yenzekileyo

I could not do this again	Andikwazanga ukuyenza le nto kwakhona
I can see everyone, you know	Ndiyakwazi ukubona wonke umntu, uyazi

All is well, that way.	Konke kulungile, ngaloo ndlela.
Maybe, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I could not stay with him	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala naye

I'm sure you'll find someone else there	Ndiqinisekile uya kufumana omnye umntu phaya
I think that's a good thing	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo

You can’t stay long, though.	Awukwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
And it is good to succeed.	Kwaye kulungile ukuphumelela.

He has to decide what to do.	Kufuneka enze isigqibo ngento amakayenze.
And again and again.	Kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.

I speak without myself	Ndithetha ngaphandle kwam
And there is a question.	Kwaye kukho umbuzo.
Please look at my picture.	Nceda ujonge umfanekiso wam.
Everyone has to find their own way.	Wonke umntu kufuneka afune indlela yakhe.
Money, money, money.	Imali, imali, imali.
I just hope one day you will get a call again	Ndiyathemba nje ngenye imini uya kufumana umnxeba kwakhona

I didn’t wait long, of course	Andizange ndilinde ixesha elide, kunjalo
All my friends, of course, before.	Bonke abahlobo bam, kunjalo, ngaphambili.

You know it's me.	Uyazi ukuba ndim.
I'll sit in the back	Ndiza kuhlala ngasemva
Long ago he was not with me.	Kudala wayengekho kum.

Sorry, no.	Uxolo, akunjalo.
I didn't want anything else	Ndandingafuni enye into
There was no time he was not with me.	Kwakungekho xesha wayengekho kum.
Well that's me.	Kulungile ndim lowo.

And he does it very well.	Kwaye uyenza kakuhle kakhulu.

You have waited too long.	Ulinde ixesha elide kakhulu.
I got behind her quickly	Ndifike emva kwakhe ngokukhawuleza

He knew this was not necessary.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kwakungeyomfuneko.
I really wonder if that is true.	Ndiyazibuza ngokwenene ukuba yinyani leyo.

I had to say things	Kwafuneka ndithethe izinto

But that did not happen.	Kodwa ayizange yenzeke loo nto.
I like that about you, though	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngawe, nangona kunjalo
I could not work.	Andizange ndikwazi ukusebenza.
Not without me, you don't go.	Hayi ngaphandle kwam, awuyi.
I want to make mistakes	Ndifuna ukwenza iimpazamo
Maybe I don't have much time	Mhlawumbi andinaxesha elininzi
I just knew he would be there	Ndandisazi nje ukuba uzakuba lapho

I have to look at something else	Kufuneka ndijonge enye into
I always thought he would come back	Bendisoloko ndicinga ukuba uya kubuya

I was hoping he knew it wasn't me	Bendinethemba lokuba uyazi ukuba ayindim
She is very happy about it.	Uyavuya kakhulu ngayo.

If so, that's fine.	Ukuba kunjalo, kuhle.

Well maybe it never was.	Kulungile mhlawumbi akuzange kube njalo.
I know you will be fine	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuba ulungile
Something very small.	Into encinci kakhulu.
He thought that meant he felt better.	Wayecinga ukuba oko kuthetha ukuba uziva engcono.
That is probably very true.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi yinyani kakhulu.
But he did not know exactly what that was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye leyo.

Maybe the kids will say no.	Mhlawumbi abantwana baya kuthi hayi.
I would like to do something	Ndingathanda ukwenza into
I could not wait to leave	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuhamba
Faster than you.	Ngokukhawuleza kunawe.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wakwenza oko.
Again thank you very much.	Kwakhona enkosi kakhulu.
He was not that far away.	Akazange abe kude kangako.
I do the same now	Nam ndenza njalo ke ngoku
I do not want to stop reading	Andifuni ukuyeka ukufunda
I am here as it is	Ndilapha njengokuba kunjalo
He went back to college.	Uye wabuyela ekholejini.
Big mistake to make	Impazamo enkulu yokwenza
I thought you wanted it that way	Ndandicinga ukuba ufuna ngolo hlobo
He had to tell the police.	Kwafuneka axelele amapolisa.
It was not as if he wanted money.	Kwakungekho ngathi ufuna imali.
Now that's right.	Ngoku kunjalo.
And we will not be far away.	Kwaye asiyi kuba kude.
He says he doesn't know.	Uthi akayazi.
I want something good before that	Ndifuna into elungileyo ngaphambi koko
I know him too	Nam ndiyamazi
I want to play with him	Ndifuna ukudlala naye
This has happened a few times.	Oku kuye kwenzeka izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
I want to do it all myself	Ndifuna ukuyenza yonke ngokwam
I asked to see the room.	Ndacela ukubona igumbi.
Down ahead, now.	Phantsi phambili, ngoku.
Whether it is you or anyone.	Nokuba ngawe okanye nabani na.
And in the hospital.	Kwaye esibhedlele.
I can't wait to go	Andikwazi kulinda ukuba ndihambe
I know how hard this can be for you	Ndiyazi ukuba inokuba nzima kangakanani kuwe le nto
I wanted to know what he was really thinking	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba wayecinga ntoni kanye kanye
He pulled out the money.	Wakhupha imali.
You don't have to tell me.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba undixelele.
Maybe not a few years.	Mhlawumbi hayi iminyaka embalwa.
He finally got there.	Ufike apho ekugqibeleni.
Yes he does.	Ewe uyayenza.
I tried to read his speech	Ndazama ukufunda intetho yakhe
I wanted you to know that.	Bendifuna uyazi lonto.
I just have to think things through	Kufuneka nje ndicinge izinto ndedwa
Well, here I am.	Ewe, ndim nje lo.
Nobody wants to play with him.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukudlala naye.
I have to tell you something about myself	Kufuneka ndikuxelele into ngam
And then he did not.	Kwaye ke akazange.
I want to be with you in this	Ndifuna ukuba nawe kule nto
I can't take his place.	Andikwazi ukuthatha indawo yakhe.
I thought so	Ndandicinga ukuba kunjalo
I like this one here though	Ndiyayithanda le apha kodwa
I know what will happen to him	Ndiyazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngaye
I didn't want to do it again	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza kwakhona
That seems very difficult now.	Oko kubonakala kunzima kakhulu ngoku.
I did not go to do it	Khange ndiye kuyenza
Obviously, it is not possible.	Ngokucacileyo, akunakwenzeka.
This should not be too difficult.	Oku akufanele kube nzima kakhulu.
Not everywhere, of course.	Hayi kuyo yonke indawo, kunjalo.
I never was	Andizange ndibe mna
Tell me what I did.	Ndixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
But he was talking.	Kodwa wayethetha.
I'm not sure what happened there.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni apho.
I just want to go there	Ndifuna nje ukuya khona
I'm not sure though	Andiqinisekanga kodwa
I finally told her	Ekugqibeleni ndamxelela
You can do it.	Ungayenza.
Nobody talks to me like that	Akukho mntu uthetha nam ngolo hlobo
And so what happened to that.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka ntoni ngaloo nto.
I saw a little later	Ndabona kancinci emva koko
Bad place to be.	Indawo embi ukuba ube.
I know what he would like	Ndiyazi ukuba angathanda ntoni
Until then, now you know.	Kuze kube ngoko, ngoku uyazi.
I knew it was something	Ndandisazi ukuba yinto
I want you to look at me	Ndifuna ujonge kum
And just for the money.	Kwaye nje ngemali.
That seems to us.	Oko kubonakala ngathi .
I really thought it was okay.	Ngokwenene ndacinga ukuba ilungile.
It does not have to be this way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube nzima ngale ndlela.
I have to tell you now	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ngoku
I haven't been here in a while	Khange ndifike kancinci apha
He did not even know where they had gone.	Wayengazi nokuba baye phi.
I think you know what's going on	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi into eyenzekayo
He says he wants to get out.	Uthi ufuna ukuphuma.
I'm glad you're here with me	Ndiyavuya ulapha kunye nam
I'm glad you're here	Ndiyavuya kuba ulapha
I know this place	Ndiyazi le ndawo
He will be here soon.	Uza kuba lapha kungekudala.
I did not know then that we would be	Ndandingazi ke ngoko ukuba siya kuba
I never knew why that was the case.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
I wanted him to leave	Bendifuna ahambe
I don't know how I feel better.	Andazi ukuba ndiziva njani ngcono.
But it lasted a few weeks.	Kodwa kwaphela iiveki ezimbalwa.
But now, it's very good.	Kodwa ngoku, kuhle kakhulu.
I can't wait to read	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda
I can't tell you all this	Andikwazi ukukuxelela yonke le nto
Well in both cases.	Kulungile kule meko ezimbini.
His attention to me.	Ingqalelo yakhe kum.
I think that is very good.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
I doubt you are asleep	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba ulele
Good night.	Kuhle ebusuku.
You do not know what will happen next.	Awuyazi into eza kwenzeka.
I had to go again	Kwafuneka ndihambe kwakhona
I'll talk to him about that later tonight.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngaloo nto kamva ngokuhlwanje.
Just trying things out.	Ukuzama nje izinto.
I will not say much.	Andiyi kuthetha kakhulu.
You can be the ultimate in it.	Unokuba nguye ekugqibeleni.
Because it is.	Ngenxa yokuba kunjalo.
Not about any.	Hayi malunga nayo nayiphi na.
I don't even know what it is.	Andazi nokuba yintoni.
We know, we know.	Siyazi, siyazi.
To know.	Ukuze wazi.
I'm sorry she's not here.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba akakho.
In the room.	Egumbini.
I never thought he would be here.	Khange ndicinge ukuba uzakuba lapha.
He is completely ready to go.	Ukulungele ngokupheleleyo ukuhamba.
There is only one name.	Kukho igama kuphela.
There was nothing of his in there.	Kwakungekho nto yakhe apho.
Not so much but some.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa ezinye.
At first he did not want to.	Ekuqaleni wayengafuni.
I can't do everything.	Andikwazi ukwenza yonke into.
He said no.	Uthe hayi.
Just no time.	Akukho xesha nje.
He didn't want you to know you could do this.	Wayengafuni ukuba wazi ukuba ungayenza le nto.
I told him it was already done	Ndamxelela ukuba sele yenziwe
I haven't heard much	Andizange ndive nto ingako
I never thought it would happen	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo
And the place, of course.	Kwaye indawo, kunjalo.
I wanted to stay with him	Bendifuna ukuhlala naye
I will get help.	Ndiza kufumana uncedo.
He tried to make a living here.	Wazama ukwenza ubomi apha.
I don't know what you ever saw in him.	Andazi wakha wabona ntoni kuye.
There you are, look at that.	Nantso ke, jonga loo nto.
I know you probably know this	Ndiyazi ukuba unokuba uyayazi le nto
I can't find anything to work with	Andikwazi ukufumana nantoni na ukusebenza
He did not succeed	Akazange aphumelele
He walked over to it.	Wahamba waya kuyo.
She came home today.	Ufike ekhaya namhlanje.
Yes we will.	Ewe siza kwenza njalo.
I had to say something.	Kwafuneka ndithethe into.
I wanted to see.	Bendifuna ukubona.
And then, once you have it.	Kwaye ke, xa sele unayo.
I can't imagine finding one	Andikwazi ukucinga ukufumana enye
And he wanted to help.	Kwaye wayefuna ukunceda.
I did not want to be	Ndandingafuni ukuba njalo
It's your job, now.	Ngumsebenzi wakho, ngoku.
I tried again, and again, and nothing happened	Ndazama kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona, kwaye akukho nto eyenzekayo
Only with more power.	Kuphela ngamandla ngakumbi.
I want.	Ndifuna.
I can't die, I can't	Andikwazi ukufa, akunjalo
But yes, he is not in it.	Kodwa ewe, akakho kuyo.
He has done this before, food.	Uye wakwenza oku ngaphambili, ukutya.
You just have hope.	Unethemba nje.
I hope you like it.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda.
I'm just telling the truth	Ndithetha nje inyani
I don't want anything	Andifuni nto
And you eat much better.	Kwaye utya ngcono kakhulu.
I'll make a phone call.	Ndiza kwenza umnxeba.
We want to play more.	Sifuna ukudlala ngakumbi.
I've been looking at you, you know	Bendisoloko ndijonge kuwe, uyazi
He should not have said anything.	Bekungafanelanga athethe nto.
It will be fun enough.	Kuya kuba mnandi ngokwaneleyo.
You look confident.	Ubonakala uqinisekile.
I couldn’t, though	Andizange ndikwazi, nangona kunjalo
I needed help, but there was none	Ndandifuna uncedo, kodwa kwakungekho
He told me that.	Uye wandixelela ukuba .
We did that.	Senze ngolo hlobo.
He saw something else there.	Wabona enye into apho.
I never heard of you	Andizange ndive ngawe
I like his speech.	Ndiyayithanda intetho yakhe.
I wanted to know what was going on inside	Bendifuna ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni ngaphakathi
I know how much you love to read	Ndiyazi ukuba uthanda kangakanani ukufunda
Questions will continue for a long time.	Imibuzo iya kuqhubeka ixesha elide.
This is what happened here.	Yile nto yenzekileyo apha.
I did not hear	Khange ndive tu
Too long to stay.	Ukuhlala kakhulu.
I'm not really sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene ngaloo nto.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuzange wenze njalo.
I don't think so	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo
No, you are the only one.	Hayi, nguwe kuphela.
If not for a long time.	Ukuba hayi ixesha elide.
I have to learn to sing like that	Kufuneka ndifunde ukucula ngolo hlobo
Look at me.	Ujonge kum.
You deserve it then.	Ufanele ngoko.
I'm not sure, though.	Andiqinisekanga, nangona kunjalo.
He will be gone.	Uza kuba engekho.
This is also possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka kwakhona.
I better go to work.	Kungcono ndiye emsebenzini.
I never, you know, to this day	Andizange, uyazi, kude kube namhlanje
I love it when she does	Ndiyayithanda xa esenza njalo
I don't want to go without you.	Andifuni ukuhamba ngaphandle kwakho.
Away from his children.	Kude nabantwana bakhe.
The other did not think.	Enye akazange acinge.
Where everyone knows everyone.	Apho wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu.
It seemed difficult.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kunzima.
Not about anything too much.	Hayi malunga nantoni na eninzi.
And there is more.	Kwaye kukho ngakumbi.
That's perfectly fine though.	Oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo nangona kunjalo.
I never heard of it.	Andizange ndive ngayo.
You want an answer now.	Ufuna impendulo ngoku.
I wanted so much	Ndandifuna kakhulu
I can control myself	Ndiyakwazi ukuzibamba
Then he fled.	Waza wabaleka.
This will be his job.	Oku kuya kuba ngumsebenzi wakhe.
I arrived at my destination.	Ndifike kwindawo yam.
I think fast.	Ndicinga ngokukhawuleza.
There is something wrong up there.	Kukho into engalunganga phaya phezulu.
It certainly seems that way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngolo hlobo.
I know where he lives	Ndiyamazi apho ahlala khona
And that's good enough.	Kwaye oko kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
I don't want to be hard on you	Andifuni ukuba nzima kuwe
I want to get out, give me money	Ndifuna ukuphuma, ndinike imali
I will tell you everything	Ndiya kuthetha kuwe ngayo yonke into
I completely forgot about him	Ndilibele tu ngaye
No, he did not stop waiting with her.	Hayi, akazange ayeke ukulinda kunye naye.
But again, you should have known better.	Kodwa kwakhona, bekufanele ukuba wazi ngcono.
But it is hard for us.	Kodwa kunzima kuthi.
Well, now you told me something.	Kulungile, ngoku undixelele into.
He is a good friend.	Ngumhlobo olungileyo.
That is not the case.	Oko akunjalo.
But I don't know why.	Kodwa andazi ukuba kutheni.
We just have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze nje.
I had to think my way	Kwafuneka ndicinge indlela yam ngayo
Many other things.	Ezinye izinto ezininzi.
I'm not so sure about this	Andiqinisekanga kangako ngale nto
Bedtime.	Ixesha lokulala.
I can read this	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda oku
I could not stop after that	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka emva koko
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Namhlanje, ngomso, kwiveki ezayo.
I could not do that	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto
They will make it happen.	Baza kuyenza yenzeke.
But enough about that.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo malunga naloo nto.
You have this restaurant.	Unayo le ndawo yokutyela.
Nice to see you here	Ndiyavuya ukubona apha
But he did not try.	Kodwa akazange azame.
I could not tell which one	Andizange ndikwazi ukuxelela ukuba yeyiphi
I wanted something small, but not too small	Ndandifuna into encinci, kodwa hayi encinci kakhulu
Then a little faster.	Emva koko ngokukhawuleza kancinci.
I want to stay with you at home	Ndifuna ukuhlala nawe ekhaya
I think that's true	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani
My mother lived here.	Umama wayehlala apha.
I would like to stay here now	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apha ngoku
I just wanted to get a phone call	Bendifuna nje ukufumana ifowuni
Finally the woman died.	Ekugqibeleni wafa umfazi.
I'm doing something that needs to be done.	Ndenza into ekufuneka yenziwe.
I think he is asleep	Ndicinga ukuba ulele
And almost all of them.	Kwaye phantse bonke.
However, it is more likely that it will not be that easy.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ukuba akuyi kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
So thank you.	Ngoko enkosi.
I can't get any better	Andikwazi ukuba ngcono
I have become a man.	Ndibe yindoda.
I can only stay longer.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide kuphela.
It's a job.	Ngumsebenzi.
Or your phone.	Okanye ifowuni yakho.
He has to do his job.	Kufuneka enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I'm asking for help with that.	Ndicela uncedo ngalonto.
He said he planned to get another job.	Wathi uceba ukufumana omnye umsebenzi.
Not another question.	Hayi omnye umbuzo.
I wanted to know what was going on	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
Yeah right now.	Ewe kulungile okwangoku.
The truth is this.	Inyaniso yile.
You will have to look into it.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge kuyo.
I wanted to know your name	Bendifuna ukwazi igama lakho
They will come.	Baya kuza.
If you are right.	Ukuba ulungile.
Then a new person.	Emva koko umntu omtsha.
Nothing at all, really.	Akukho nto kwaphela, ngokwenene.
Wife and children.	Umfazi kunye nabantwana.
I had no idea what was going to happen	Ndandingazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni
You'd better stay here if you can.	Kungcono uhlale apha ukuba kunokwenzeka.
This is my first visit	Ndiyaqala ukuya kuyo
Today, not so much.	Namhlanje, hayi kakhulu.
I have been in town for a long time	Kudala ndilapha edolophini
I did not want to read	Ndandingafuni ukufunda
And back, again.	Kwaye emva, kwakhona.
I knew why, but I said nothing	Ndandisazi isizathu, kodwa andizange ndithethe nto
I never knew about this.	Andizange ndiyazi ngale nto.
I love my house here	Ndiyayithanda indlu yam apha
Only very good.	Kuphela kakuhle kakhulu.
I will not do anything unless you want me to	Andisayi kwenza nto ngaphandle kokuba ufuna ndenze njalo
I just want you to know one thing	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi into enye
You're sure you don't want to.	Uqinisekile ukuba awufuni.
I do this, every day	Ndenza oku, yonke imihla
And so it is.	Kwaye kunjalo ke.
There is no way he was unaware of this.	Akukho ndlela yokuba wayengazi ngale nto.
So no one.	Ngoko akukho mntu.
And then two.	Kwaye emva koko ezimbini.
Yes I am.	Ewe ndim.
But not a little.	Kodwa hayi kancinci.
I just wanted to make a good picture	Ndandifuna nje ukwenza umfanekiso omhle
I want to know how you do this.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba ukwenza njani oku.
The same thing to get.	Into efanayo ukufumana.
I would like to stay longer.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala ixesha elide.
They live in the same room.	Bahlala kwigumbi elinye.
For you know that none of us does it alone.	Kuba uyazi, akukho namnye kuthi owenza oku yedwa.
You came more.	Uze ngakumbi.
I look forward to learning more about it	Ndijonge phambili ukufunda ngakumbi ngayo
I don't want to take your time.	Andifuni kuthatha ixesha lakho.
The problem is that you say one thing and do another.	Ingxaki kukuba uthetha enye into kodwa enze enye.
You feel your way, good or bad.	Uziva ngendlela yakho, kakuhle okanye kakubi.
I really need help	Ndifuna uncedo ngenene
I think that is strange	Ndicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo
But there is no question.	Kodwa akukho mbuzo.
I want to win and go downtown	Ndifuna ukuphumelela ndihambe edolophini
How about today.	Njani namhlanje.
I wonder about his age	Ndiyazibuza ngeminyaka yakhe
I did not go to work today	Khange ndiye emsebenzini namhlanje
I want him to go above anyone else	Ndifuna ahambe ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na
Don't buy food too early.	Musa ukuthenga ukutya kwangethuba.
I wanted to know everything about him	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into ngaye
I want to help with that	Ndifuna ukunceda kuloo nto
I don't want to think about him now.	Andifuni ukucinga ngaye ngoku.
Or maybe it's just one person.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngumntu omnye.
This is great at this point in time.	Oku kuhle ngeli xesha ngeli xesha.
I was hoping it was you	Bendinethemba lokuba nguwe
Well, maybe one or two.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi enye okanye ezimbini.
You need to be able to stop.	Kufuneka ukwazi ukuyeka.
I do not know where it is	Andazi ukuba iphi
He will try his best.	Uya kuzama kangangoko.
How can you be.	Unokuba njani.
Is it possible.	Ngaba kunokwenzeka.
I can’t stop thinking about work	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngomsebenzi
The problem is who he is.	Ingxaki kukuba ngubani.
I will definitely be back	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya
He came and took my mother.	Ufike wathatha umama.
This comes later, but nothing earlier.	Oku kuza kamva, kodwa akukho nto ngaphambili.
I'm not sure here.	Andiqinisekanga apha.
I wanted to do that.	Ndandifuna ukwenjenjalo.
I did not look	khange ndijonge
This must be a big job.	Oku kumele ukuba ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
And finally.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni.
I had to do something big, big	Kwafuneka ndenze into enkulu, enkulu
But one and the other.	Kodwa enye kwaye.
But there seems to be a big problem.	Kodwa kubonakala kukho ingxaki enkulu.
I did not think that far	Khange ndicinge kude kangako
I really want to talk to you	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe
Stop playing now.	Yeka ukudlala ngoku.
I have to figure out who to tell	Kufuneka ndicinge ukuba ndimxelele bani
I want to die now	Ndifuna ukufa ngoku
He does not know that anyone is there, except him.	Akazi ukuba kukho nabani na, ngaphandle kwakhe.
I have to go to work	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini
I never told her why.	Khange ndimxelele ukuba kutheni.
I hope so, for my own sake	Ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo, ngenxa yam
That is why it takes so long.	Yiyo loo nto kuthatha ixesha elide.
He said he should talk to me.	Uye wathi kufuneka athethe nam.
So what are you waiting for ??.	Khona ulindele ntoni ??.
I will win again tonight	Ndiza kuphumelela kwakhona ngokuhlwanje
Maybe he wants us all to go.	Mhlawumbi unqwenela ukuba sihambe sonke.
However, you need to know.	Nangona kunjalo, kufuneka ukwazi.
Everything is done.	Yenziwe yonke into.
But your mother.	Kodwa umama wakho.
It has not been easy.	Akuzange kube lula.
You have waited long enough.	Ulinde ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
Not mom but.	Hayi umama kodwa.

I want to know more than that	Ndifuna ukwazi ngaphezu koko
I never really knew what happened	Andizange ndikwazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I want your children	Ndifuna abantwana bakho

I never saw him	Andizange ndimbone
I made lunch.	Ndenze isidlo sasemini.
Little did I know that walking would be difficult	Ndandingazi ukuba ukuhamba kunokuba nzima
I wanted to die like that.	Ndandifuna ukufa ngolo hlobo.
He ran into us.	Wabaleka wangena kuthi.
I mean, look.	Ndithetha, jonga.
I want him to have what he wants	Ndifuna abe nayo le nto ayifunayo
I come here thinking of you.	Ndiza apha ndicinga ngawe.
I doubt there is anything unusual here	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga apha

This is my job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wam.
What you know.	Oko uyazi.
Slightly but not too much	Kancinci kodwa hayi kakhulu
I'm sure you do, too.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayenza, nawe.
That could be.	Oko kunokuba.
We want to go fast.	Sifuna sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
I knew there was something strange about you	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga ngawe

But he was not that way.	Kodwa wayengekho ngaloo ndlela.
I can do it, though	Ndingayenza, nangona kunjalo
You don't even have to do it.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba wenze.

In one month.	Kwinyanga enye.
I want to work with you	Ndifuna ukusebenza nawe
So it's a doctor.	Ngoko ke ngugqirha.
But why are you trying to tell me.	Kodwa kutheni uzama ukukuxelela.
I didn’t know what it was, but something	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni, kodwa into ethile

I want you to do something	Ndifuna wenze into
I have to tell you something	Kufuneka ndikuxelele into
I really want to be that way again	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba njalo kwakhona
Probably no one should learn from it	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu ufanele afunde nantoni na kuyo
I wanted to arrive early	Bendifuna ukufika kwangethuba

It could not be you.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba nguwe lo.
I did not want to think	Ndandingafuni ukucinga
I doubt anyone will come today	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba ukhona umntu oza kuza namhlanje
I thought you were coming alone	Bendicinga ukuba uza wedwa
I want to tell you no	Ndifuna ukukuxelela ukuba hayi

I only saw the woman	Ndabona umfazi kuphela

I don't know how you feel	Andazi ukuba uziva njani

None of us want to die.	Akukho namnye kuthi ofuna ukufa.
I couldn't help it at the time	Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ngelo xesha
I just want to stay away from it	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala kude kuyo
I saw the same thing	Ndabona into enye
You know what's going to happen.	Uyayazi into eza kwenzeka.
You know, you shouldn't do that.	Uyazi, akufanele uyenze loo nto.

It can be without one.	Kunokuba ngaphandle komnye.
I can't say for sure right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo ngoku.
If not now, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, kungekudala.

I knew it would happen, though	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo

You do not know that for sure.	Awuyazi loo nto ngokuqinisekileyo.

This will continue.	Oku kuya kuqhubeka.
But it is hard to imagine a better one.	Kodwa kunzima ukucinga ukwenza ngcono.

You know that.	Uyakwazi oko.

He tried to get out of it.	Wazama ukuphuma kuyo.

Or, okay.	Okanye, kulungile.
I knew for sure that he was not both	Ndandisazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ayinguye bobabini
But it is not that difficult.	Kodwa akukho nzima kangako.

I do not have to stay	Akufunekanga ndihlale
I'm so sorry, so much for that.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu, kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle.
For this you have to do a lot of things.	Ngale nto kufuneka wenze izinto ezininzi.
And not at all.	Kwaye akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
I did such a great thing for nothing.	Ndenza into enkulu kangaka ngaphandle kwanto.
And your new phone.	Kwaye ifowuni yakho entsha.
I don't know what happened to me.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
And in it.	Kwaye kuyo.
I'll get to that later	Ndiza kufika kuloo nto kamva

You do not have to look.	Akufunekanga ujonge.
Receiving a letter.	Ukufumana ileta.

I thought it would be hard	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima

I like it though	Ndiyayithanda kodwa
I can't walk here.	Andikwazi kuhamba apha.

And it will be.	Kwaye kuya kuba.
I never thought about my job	Andizange ndicinge ngomsebenzi wam
At first he said no.	Ekuqaleni wathi hayi.
It never happened to me.	Ayizange yenzeke kum.
Finally he tried to speak.	Ekugqibeleni wazama ukuthetha.
It wasn't you.	Akuzange kube nguwe.

Would you like to go there.	Ungathanda ukuya khona.
And you will have to tell the truth.	Kwaye kuya kufuneka uthethe inyani.

But this will not go away.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuhamba.

I do this all the time.	Ndiyenza le nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
I need to be able to talk more next week	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukuthetha ngakumbi kwiveki ezayo

He was with me.	Waba nam.
Please go there.	Nceda uye apho.
It's a little better in a big place.	Kungcono kancinci kwindawo enkulu.

I did not want to say this to you	Bendingafuni ukuyithetha lento kuwe

He came home with people in his house.	Wafika ekhaya kukho abantu endlini yakhe.
We've done that now.	Senze loo nto ngoku.
I had no idea where he lived	Ndandingazi ukuba uhlala phi
Not me, though.	Hayi mna, nangona kunjalo.
I will try.	Ndiza kuzama.
You are happy when you are.	Uyavuya xa unjalo.
He plays football with me.	Udlala ibhola nam.
He slept for weeks.	Walala iiveki.
Everyone else has gone.	Bonke abanye baye.
We need to be here.	Kufuneka sibe lapha.
I want to do it myself.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngokwam.
No one will be able to see anything outside.	Akukho mntu uya kukwazi ukubona nantoni na ngaphandle.
Now, however, you know better.	Ngoku, nangona kunjalo, wazi ngcono.
That's what happened.	Nantso into eyenzekayo.
Time and that.	Ixesha kunye naloo.
I just want to make time.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza ixesha.
I knew it was probably nothing	Ndandisazi ukuba mhlawumbi akukho nto
I have to talk openly about it.	Kufuneka ndithethe phandle ngayo.
But first, he wanted money.	Kodwa kuqala, wayefuna imali.
And one does not know how to get there.	Kwaye umntu akazi ukuba ufike njani apho.
I didn't want that from him	Bendingafuni kuye lonto
I know you have to do it	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka uyenze
I will do a lot of this	Ndiza kuyenza kakhulu le nto
Again, he said no.	Kwakhona, wathi hayi.
I want to know if this is true	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba yinyani na le nto
I don’t have it, and I won’t have it.	Andinayo, kwaye andisayi kuba nayo.
That will probably come back in time.	Oko mhlawumbi kuya kubuya ngexesha.
I definitely need to talk to her.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ndithethe naye.
I will be with you	ndiya kuba nawe
He is doing work.	Uqhuba umsebenzi.
I'll try to get the picture.	Ndiza kuzama ukufumana umfanekiso.
I live in my new place	Ndihlala kwindawo yam entsha
I wanted to talk to you before	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe phambi koko
I never thought or heard anything	Khange ndicinge okanye ndive nto
He looked down.	Uye wajonga phantsi.
I had to sit there waiting	Kwafuneka ndihlale apho ndilinde
I think they will talk about me, both.	Ndicinga ukuba baya kuthetha ngam, bobabini.
I hope this will work out	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kuya kuphumelela
I knew this was going to happen eventually	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni
Anyway, how good.	Nangona kunjalo, kuhle kangakanani.
I wish he came here	Ndinqwenela ukuba eze apha
You should not have stayed home.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba uhlale ekhaya.
I know where you do it	Ndiyazi apho uyenza khona
I had no idea what was happening to him	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye
This is not just top notch.	Oku akukho nje phezulu.
He said it happened instantly.	Wathi yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He thought, though.	Wayecinga, nangona kunjalo.
I also know what happened to you	Nam ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo kuwe
I'll try to make one	Ndiza kuzama ukwenza enye
I'm tired but it's okay.	Ndidiniwe kodwa kulungile.
What do you think.	Ingaba ucinga ntoni.
I don't want to be her again.	Andifuni ukuba nguye kwakhona.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
I did not want to leave	Bendingafuni ukuhamba
He thought fast.	Wayecinga ngokukhawuleza.
It was not enough.	Kwakungekho ngokwaneleyo.
Please go.	Nceda uhambe.
As fun as it may be.	Njengoko kunokuba mnandi kunjalo.
This is nothing at all.	Oku akukho nto kwaphela.
I will do it tomorrow.	Ndiza kuyenza ngomso.
Maybe just a few hours.	Mhlawumbi nje iiyure ezimbalwa.
I wanted to, and I tried a few times	Ndandifuna, kwaye ndazama izihlandlo ezimbalwa
He slept in your room for two weeks.	Walala egumbini lakho iiveki ezimbini.
But man will do it.	Kodwa umntu uya kuyenza.
I never thought it would happen so quickly	Andizange ndicinge ukuba iya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza
I thought of you every day	Ndandicinga ngawe yonke imihla
I know you are determined	Ndiyazi ukuba uzimisele
I want to do things	Ndifuna ukwenza izinto
I will not say anything	Andiyi kuthetha nto
Maybe not so much.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.
And he saw that he looked much better.	Kwaye wabona ukuba ukhangeleka engcono kakhulu.
I never thought he would do it	Khange ndicinge ukuba angayenza
I'm here, as it were.	Ndilapha, njengokuba kunjalo.
At last .	Ekugqibeleni .
I can't make another phone	Andikwazi ukwenza enye ifowuni
I can't take anything else right now.	Andikwazi ukuthatha enye into okwangoku.
I know it will be difficult	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima
You want money.	Ufuna imali.
If you want to, you can't say anything at all.	Ukuba uyafuna, awukwazi ukuthetha nto konke konke.
You know the place.	Uyayazi loo ndawo.
Yes, not me.	Ewe, hayi mna kanye.
I hope you have.	Ndiyathemba ukuba unayo.
But still there was nothing.	Kodwa nangoko kwakungekho nto.
So maybe we will get the answer.	Ngoko mhlawumbi siya kufumana impendulo.
I don't know how his wife felt about it	Andazi ukuba waziva njani umfazi wakhe ngaloo nto
I am right here in front of you	Ndilapha kanye phambi kwakho
I think I did it myself	Ndicinga ukuba ndiyenze ngokwam
He'll be a man.	Uzakuba yindoda.
He agreed to it.	Wavuma kuyo.
But give me a place.	Kodwa ndinike indawo.
And he is not here.	Kwaye akakho apha.
I hoped it would be so	Bendinethemba lokuba iya kuba njalo
As you do everything else.	Njengoko wenza yonke enye into.
I told her she was fine.	Ndamxelela ukuba ulungile.
I hope you do too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe wenze njalo.
Almost everyone thought so.	Phantse wonke umntu wayecinga njalo.
And it will happen.	Kwaye kuya kwenzeka.
I'm not sure about that	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto
He is intelligent.	Ukrelekrele ke.
He never said that to me.	Akazange athethe nam oko.
I thought of him.	Ndacinga ngaye.
I want to help you, if you need help	Ndifuna ukukunceda, ukuba ufuna uncedo
He wanted, very much, to talk to me.	Wayefuna, kakhulu, ukuthetha nam.
Tell me now.	Ndixelele ke ngoku.
He did just that.	Wenze ngolo hlobo ke.
This is definitely better.	Lo ngokuqinisekileyo ungcono.
That means talking.	Oko kuthetha ukuthetha.
You need a doctor.	Kufuneka ugqirha.
I made a small mistake here	Ndenze impazamo encinci apha
And so it is, and so is it.	Kwaye kunjalo, kwaye kunjalo.
So we will do it ourselves.	Ngoko siya kuyenza ngokwethu.
I can't, though.	Andikwazi, nangona kunjalo.
I learned many things	Ndifunde izinto ezininzi
I want to be a good person	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu olungileyo
I can't think right now	Andikwazi ukucinga ngoku
But he did not go that far.	Kodwa akazange aye kude kangako.
This is hard to do.	Oku kunzima ukwenza.
You can be human.	Unokuba ngumntu.
I just want to take things in stride	Ndifuna nje ukuthatha izinto kancinci kancinci
I'm trying to be a better person	Ndizama ukuba ngumntu ongcono
It is always true.	Ukuhlala kukho yinyani.
It's so much better for you	Kungcono kakhulu kuwe
He lived there for three years.	Wahlala apho iminyaka emithathu.
When you feel good about yourself, you look outwardly.	Xa uziva ulungile ngawe, ubonakala ngaphandle.
Really, right away.	Ngokwenene, ngoko nangoko .
I have always tried my best to help you	Kudala ndizama ngamandla ukukunceda
He thought he could do it.	Wayecinga ukuba angayenza.
No one was talking about me.	Kwakungekho mntu uthetha ngam.
I won't be back here in a few hours.	Andiyi kubuya apha iiyure ezimbalwa.
I think about everything.	Ndicinga ngayo yonke into.
I suspect this is what happened	Ndiyarhana ukuba yile nto yenzekileyo
I want to talk to you very, very badly	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe kakhulu, kakubi kakhulu
You do not have to talk about it.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe ngayo.
She hoped she would be late for school.	Wayenethemba lokuba uza kufika emva kwexesha esikolweni.
I told you about this	Ndikuxelele ngale nto
We'll see about that, he thought.	Siza kubona ngaloo nto, wacinga njalo.
I think everyone did.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu wenze njalo.
I know how much it means to you	Ndiyazi ukuba kuthetha kangakanani kuwe
I think now is a good time	Ndicinga ukuba ngoku lixesha elihle
I know it's not that easy	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho lula ngolo hlobo
What do you think?.	Ingaba ucinga ntoni?.
I don’t know why you did such a great thing with it.	Andazi ukuba kutheni wenze into enkulu kangaka ngayo.
Do as you like.	Ukwenza njengoko uthanda.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
We haven't been together in a long time.	Asizange sibe kunye ixesha elide.
Probably talking to himself.	Mhlawumbi ethetha yedwa.
Question for you this morning.	Umbuzo kuwe ngale ntsasa.
I do it alone.	Ndiyenza ndedwa.
A little talk will be required.	Intetho encinci iya kufuneka.
I think after that purchase	Ndicinga emva koko kuthenga
I thought everything about it was well done.	Ndandicinga ukuba yonke into ngayo yenziwe kakuhle.
I do not remember the answer.	Andikhumbuli impendulo yakhe.
I know now that this is true	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba yinyani le
She told her mother that.	Waxelela umama wakhe oko.
I feel everywhere, inside, outside	Ndiziva yonke indawo, ngaphakathi, ngaphandle
If you are ready to go.	Ukuba ukulungele ukuhamba.
I know you're trying to help	Ndiyazi ukuba uzama ukunceda
I know he will never go	Ndiyamazi soze ahambe
He did not do it regularly.	Akazange ayenze rhoqo.
It's hard to tell.	Kunzima ukuxelela.
Great place to stay	Indawo entle yokuhlala
I think you are right	Ndicinga ukuba ulungile
I would like an answer.	Ndingathanda ukufumana impendulo.
There is something very wrong with all of this.	Kukho into embi kakhulu ngayo yonke le nto.
I thought he could not speak at the time.	Ndandicinga ukuba akakwazi ukuthetha ngelo xesha.
And you in it, of course.	Nawe kuyo, kunjalo.
There is plenty of room upstairs.	Kukho indawo eninzi phezulu.
I hesitate to talk to him	Ndiyathandabuza ukuthetha naye
This should not happen.	Oku akufanele kwenzeke.
But there is no way, now.	Kodwa akukho ndlela, ngoku.
I always think of this everywhere in a beautiful place.	Ndihlala ndicinga oku kuyo yonke indawo entle.
It doesn't even have to be.	Akuyomfuneko nokuba.
Now I know two things	Ngoku ndiyazi izinto ezimbini
I never thought of anything	Andizange ndicinge nto
I don't have to look back.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndijonge ngasemva.
I would like to meet him personally	Ndingathanda ukudibana naye ngokwam
But one problem.	Kodwa ingxaki enye.
I learned one or two things.	Ndifunde into enye okanye ezimbini.
Maybe it’s not something you want to do regularly.	Mhlawumbi asiyonto ofuna ukuyenza rhoqo.
You like it?' 	Uyayithanda?'
And there is no tomorrow.	Kwaye akukho ngomso.
I did it once, but not too much.	Ndenze kanye, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
If we need help.	Ukuba sifuna uncedo.
And he did not succeed.	Kwaye akazange aphumelele.
I made a big mistake	Ndenze impazamo enkulu
I can't do it tonight	Andikwazi ukwenza ngoku ebusuku
I never thought	Andizange ndicinge
He also did not want to talk about it.	Naye wayengafuni kuthetha ngayo.
He would return.	Wayeza kubuya.
I knew it would happen again.	Ndandisazi ukuba iya kwenzeka kwakhona.
I decided to go there if I could	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndiye kuloo ndawo ukuba kunokwenzeka
I didn’t think it was just a thing	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinto nje
I'll have to think about this	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngale nto
I want to know what happened next	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko
I don't know how we did it.	Andazi ukuba senze njani.
I will stay with her.	Ndiya kuhlala nayo.
I can't do anything about it	Andikwazi kwenza nto ngaloo nto
You will find a way.	Uza kufumana indlela.
In the room, like this.	Kwigumbi, ngolu hlobo.
And work, too.	Kwaye umsebenzi, kakhulu.
I know that, for sure.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Me, not so much.	Mna, hayi kakhulu.
It means a few things to me.	Kuthetha izinto ezimbalwa kum.
I will sit before you.	Ndiya kuhlala phambi kwakho.
Or you will not.	Okanye awuyi.
I made a big mistake	Ndenza impazamo enkulu
I watched for a long time	Ndijonge ixesha elide
I never thought of it	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo
I can't wait to eat something else	Andikwazi ukulinda ukutya enye into
Isn't it?.	Akunjalo?.
We made a mistake.	Senze impazamo.
That's exactly right.	Kunjalo kanye ngokwenene.
I did nothing about it, of course	Andizange ndenze nto ngayo, kunjalo
I am waiting for an answer	Ndilinde impendulo
I did not know anything until today	Bendingazi nto kude kube namhlanje
But he wanted to get out.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuphuma.
But not me.	Kodwa hayi mna.
And for me, for that.	Kwaye kum, ngaloo nto.
I did not tell anyone	Khange ndixelele mntu
She arrived late for her breakfast.	Ufike emva kwexesha kwisidlo sakusasa sakhe.
So he did not go anywhere.	Ngoko akazange aye ndawo.
I want to stay in the office	Ndifuna ukuhlala eofisini
But you can be.	Kodwa unokuba njalo.
You know inside.	Uyazi ngaphakathi.
I want to do something new.	Ndifuna ukwenza into entsha.

But not all.	Kodwa hayi yonke.

I think about him every day	Ndicinga ngaye yonke imihla

I thought this would look better	Bendicinga ukuba oku kuya kubonakala ngcono
He is our friend.	Ngumhlobo wethu.
I should, of course	Ndifanele, kunjalo
He wanted to see her eyes.	Wayefuna ukubona amehlo akhe.
I didn’t want to think too long about that	Bendingafuni ukucinga ixesha elide ngalonto
I have to do that first	Kufuneka ndenze oko kuqala
I certainly have never done that before	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili
The thing is this.	Into yile.
But now tell me.	Kodwa ngoku ndixelele.
All right, you're asleep.	Kulungile, ulele.
Because that's what it's true.	Kuba yiloo nto ukuba yinyani.
I tried to imagine what that could be	Ndazama ukucinga ukuba inokuba njani loo nto
No, this time.	Hayi, ngeli xesha.
No one really says that.	Akukho mntu uthetha loo nto ngokwenene.
I will do more than that.	Ndiya kwenza ngaphezu koko.
You can tell if something is happening.	Uyakwazi ukuxelela ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
Something to do, finally.	Into yokwenza, ekugqibeleni.
I think it never happened	Ndicinga ukuba akuzange kwenzeke

He finally finished.	Wagqiba ekugqibeleni.
I never thought of doing something like this	Khange ndicinge nto ngokwenza into enje

I'm very skeptical though	Ndiyathandabuza kakhulu nangona kunjalo

He stayed with you, though.	Wahlala nawe, nangona kunjalo.
I have done a very bad thing	Ndenze into embi kakhulu
In town if not.	Edolophini ukuba zange.

But it also takes time.	Kodwa kwakhona kuthatha ixesha.
He spoke first.	Wathetha kuqala.
You play hard.	Udlala nzima.
Or mind.	Okanye ingqondo.
I knew it would happen, but	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka, kodwa
You came here.	Uze apha.

I look forward to going to my office	Ndijonge phambili ukuya eofisini yam
I thought it was true	Ndandicinga ukuba yinyani

There seems to be something here.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into apha.
I am waiting for more time	Ndilinde ixesha elingakumbi
All in front of me.	Konke phambi kwam.

To be continued.	Iza kuqhubeka.
I just want to run something for you	Ndifuna nje ukuqhuba into ngawe

But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo kwaphela.
However, it is not easy.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho lula.
I thought you were lucky	Ndandicinga ukuba unethamsanqa
I can't go again.	Andikwazi ukuya kwakhona.

And every day he will come here.	Kwaye yonke imihla uya kuza apha.
I could not stay here	Andikwazanga kuhlala apha

That's just my little thing.	Yinto nje encinci yam leyo.
I wanted to be outside	Ndandifuna ukuba ngaphandle

I did not see anything	Khange ndibone nto

I will make coffee	Ndiza kwenza ikofu

I don't care, really.	Andikhathali, ngokwenene.
I forgot to tell you	Ndilibele ukukuxelela

I thought he would come back	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kubuya
You do not have to be angry.	Akufunekanga ube nomsindo.

I wanted to know what happened there	Bendifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni apho

That is not necessary.	Oko akufuneki.

However this did not happen.	Nangona kunjalo oku akuzange kwenzeke.
I only know it to be true	Ndiyazi kuphela ukuba yinyani

Almost everyone retired.	Phantse wonke umntu wayedla umhlala-phantsi.
Not if anything happens.	Hayi ukuba kwenzeka nantoni na.
I wanted to talk to you before	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe ngaphambili
And more at this time.	Kwaye ngakumbi ngeli xesha.
I did not tell him anything	Khange ndimxelele nto
Not so much though.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa.

I could see no reason why we should be like that	Andizange ndibone sizathu sokuba nathi sibe njalo

I could not repeat	Andikwazanga kuphinda

A small ball	Ibhola encinci
They will go to it next week.	Baza kuyo kwiveki ezayo.
I had to make a plan	Kwafuneka ndenze icebo
He stayed away from her for a few years.	Wahlala kude naye iminyaka embalwa.
But not for someone else.	Kodwa hayi komnye umntu.
The job looks better.	Umsebenzi ukhangeleka ngcono.
He's here now, by the way.	Ulapha ngoku, ngendlela.
I just don't remember which one	Andikhumbuli nje ukuba yeyiphi
But this is how you learn.	Kodwa yile ndlela ufunda ngayo.
I have to know what it is	Ndifanele ukwazi ukuba yintoni na
I do not understand how	Andiqondi ukuba njani
I did not hear anything after that	Andizange ndive nto emva koko
I tried to do that.	Ndazama ukwenza oko.
He has to really do something about it.	Kufuneka enze into ngenene ngayo.
That's it for now.	Yiloo nto okwangoku.
Glad you're here !.	Ndiyavuya ulapha!.

Well, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile ke.
I wanted to talk to you first	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe kuqala
Everyone is tired.	Wonke umntu udiniwe.
He saw many things.	Wabona izinto ezininzi.
And someone after that.	Kwaye umntu emva koko.
He left it.	Wemka kuyo.
Or the police.	Okanye amapolisa.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba kufuneka enze ntoni.
I never thought there was a reason	Khange ndicinge ukuba kukho sizathu
It wasn't long.	Khange kube kudala.
I thought he was a schoolboy at first	Ndandicinga ukuba ngumntwana wesikolo ekuqaleni
I don't know where he is or what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba uphi okanye kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
I knew you would be alone	Bendisazi ukuba uzakuba wedwa
I don't know what's in there	Andazi ukuba yintoni na apho
And he would do it again.	Kwaye wayeza kuyenza kwakhona.
I have to tell her something	Kufuneka ndimxelele enye into

I think it is possible that you live there	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka ukuba uhlala apho
I'll come back later	Ndiza kubuya kamva
I made money last week.	Ndenze imali kwiveki ephelileyo.
To him, that's a friend.	Kuye, loo nto ngumhlobo.
I think tomorrow.	Ndicinga kusasa.
But my mother did just that.	Kodwa umama wenza kanye loo nto.
I haven't seen him in a long time	Khange ndimbone kudala
I had to do this outdoors	Kwafuneka ndiyenze le nto ngaphandle
Well, maybe he's asleep now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ulele ngoku.
I did not speak to him	Khange ndithethe naye
He stayed there and studied.	Wahlala apho wafunda.
He pretends he doesn't want to.	Wenza ngathi akafuni.
That's what makes you who you are.	Yiloo nto ekwenza ukuba ube nguwe.
My mother opened her eyes.	Wavula amehlo umama.
This is a long time coming.	Oku kudala kuza.
To himself, one.	Kuye ngokwakhe, enye.
There is more to it than that.	Kukho okuninzi apho.
I did it as fast as I could.	Ndenze ngokukhawuleza kangangoko.
I wanted to stay and help	Ndandifuna ukuhlala ndincede
I never knew you before	Andizange ndikwazi ngaphambili
I did not know exactly when	Ndandingazi ukuba nini kanye kanye

It was not then.	Kwakungekho ngelo xesha.
I know why you are here	Ndiyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha
But he knew better.	Kodwa wayesazi ngcono.
I think it will be good for all of us	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kuthi sonke

I had to know it was just you	Kwafuneka ndiyazi ukuba nguwe kanye kanye
We do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo.
I'm not even sure if there is one answer.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba kukho impendulo enye.
I don't know what to expect from me	Andazi ukuba ulindele ntoni kum
I know you have the same problem	Ndiyazi ukuba unengxaki efanayo
I wanted to get out, go	Bendifuna ukuphuma, ndihambe
I just want to be someone who makes music.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ngumntu owenza umculo.
I hope you will	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuba njalo
I can only do this	Ndiyakwazi nje ukuyenza le nto
He asked me to go to him.	Wandicela ukuba ndiye kuye.
I can't eat my breakfast here	Andikwazi ukutya isidlo sam sakusasa apha
Obviously that is possible.	Ngokucacileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
I never heard of it	khange ndive ngayo

You can decide with power.	Uyakwazi ukugqiba ngamandla.
I do not know for sure why.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kutheni.
I think he wants to talk to himself	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ukuthetha yedwa
And he kept doing it.	Waza waqhubeka ekwenza.
Doing the right thing is difficult	Ukwenza kakuhle kunzima
I want you to make an appointment.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze ukudibana.

I can't talk to her	Andikwazi kuthetha naye
You did a good job there.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle phaya.

I had no idea what it would be like	Ndandingazi ukuba kuya kuba njani
That's it, he did.	Yiloo nto, uyenzile.
I can't find a job.	Andikwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
Very good work but it is my time now	Umsebenzi omhle kakhulu kodwa lixesha lam ngoku

However, he did not succeed.	Nangona kunjalo, akazange aphumelele.
I thought you wanted to see	Bendicinga ufuna ukubona
It takes life to do it.	Kuthatha ubomi ukuyenza.
In a good way, it is.	Ngendlela elungileyo, kunjalo.
But I am.	Kodwa ndim.
I want to be in it.	Ndifuna ukuba kuyo.
Do not try to do everything.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza yonke into.
I didn't know it was you	Bendingazi ukuba nguwe

I could not sit still	Khange ndikwazi ukuhlala
He totally agreed.	Wavuma ngokupheleleyo.
Little did I know that someone else was coming here	Ndandingazi ukuba kukho omnye umntu oza apha

I thought you went well	Bendicinga uhambe kakuhle

Have you seen a little here or there.	Ukhe wabona kancinci apha okanye phaya.
But you.	Kodwa wena.
However, at present it is not possible.	Nangona kunjalo, okwangoku akunakwenzeka.

Well, maybe not.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I would really like to know why	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukwazi ukuba kutheni

I thought it would work	Bendicinga ukuba iya kuphumelela
I just wanted to do one tonight	Bendifuna nje ukwenza enye ngokuhlwanje

It was not difficult for him.	Kwakungekho nzima kuyo.
I can't wait to eat meat	Andikwazi kulinda ukutya inyama
I saw nothing but him	Andizange ndibone enye into ngaphandle kwakhe

Nothing more, though.	Akukho ngaphezu koko, nangona kunjalo.
But not in the evening at this time.	Kodwa hayi ngokuhlwa ngeli xesha.
Today.	Namhlanje.
Maybe you will get a job, maybe you will not get one.	Mhlawumbi uya kufumana umsebenzi, mhlawumbi awuyi kufumana.
I apologize for the inconvenience	Ndiyaxolisa ngale meko
You have to do well in the morning.	Kufuneka wenze kakuhle kusasa.
One ran ahead and opened the door.	Omnye wabaleka waya ngaphambili wavula ucango lwakhe.
I’m not even sure he realized he had it.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba waqonda ukuba unayo.
I didn't know anything else	Ndandingazi enye into
And that's exactly what happened	Kwaye oko kube njalo ngokupheleleyo
There really is.	Kukho ngokwenene.
I did not want to go to the party	Ndandingafuni ukuya epatini

Simply put.	Ukuthetha nje.
He returned to it.	Wabuyela kuyo.
I made mistakes	Ndenze iimpazamo

I did not speak	Khange ndithethe

Me, I don't want to do that.	Mna, andifuni kuyenza loo nto.

I looked up first	Ndijonge phezulu kuqala
I had no idea what he knew	Ndandingazi ukuba wayesazi ntoni

I wanted to stay with you	Bendifuna ukuhlala nawe
No, he did not want to meet her.	Hayi, wayengafuni ukudibana naye.

I was not late.	Khange ndibe late.
I want you to know that	Ndifuna uyazi loo nto
I have only done two so far	Ndenze ezimbini kuphela okwangoku

I wish it were so.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo.
I know what you are talking about.	Ndiyayazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni.

My mother has gone to work.	Umama uye wahamba waya emsebenzini.
I really want you to be here	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba ube lapha
I can get his attention and talk to him about it	Ndiyakwazi ukufumana ingqalelo yakhe kwaye ndithethe naye ngoko
I am here for you now	Ndilapha ngenxa yakho ngoku
I'm talking to you.	Ndithetha nawe.
He thinks too much of you.	Ucinga kakhulu ngawe.
Yes, they have been around for a long time.	Ewe, baye bahlala ixesha elide.
I didn't know much about that	Bendingazi kakhulu ngalonto
But he has done it now.	Kodwa uyenzile ngoku.
I'm not sure he'll do it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uya kuyenza.
And he didn't know what to do again.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni kwakhona.
That's what he wants.	Yiloo nto ayifunayo.
I will always be here	Ndiya kuhlala ndilapha
The place is fine too.	Indawo ilungile nayo.
But still nothing.	Kodwa nangoko akukho nto.
The encounter will take longer.	Ukudibana kuya kuthatha ixesha elingakumbi.
This is your reality.	Le yinyani yakho.
He is nowhere to be seen.	Akabonakali ndawo.
He wants a night in town.	Ufuna ubusuku edolophini.
I'm happy to talk about it	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha ngayo
I will not go with you	Andiyi kuhamba nawe
I see no problem here	Andiboni nto ingxaki apha
I always think about that	Ndihlala ndicinga ngaloo nto
It only takes time to get there.	Kuthatha nje ixesha ukufika apho.
I already know what's going on	Sele ndiyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
Thanks again, though.	Enkosi kwakhona, nangona kunjalo.
I didn't want to do this	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza lento
We want the truth.	Sifuna inyaniso.
Not a chance.	Hayi ithuba.
I will not have it any other way	Andiyi kuba nayo ngenye indlela
I know who you are talking about now	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha bani ngoku
But maybe you should wait for the doctor.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kungcono ulinde ugqirha.
Long for him.	Mde kuye.
I did not know that this was strange.	Ndandingazi ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
I think this will be the case.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba njalo.
That will do well enough.	Oko kuya kwenza kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
So many years.	Iminyaka emininzi kangaka.
Getting it right.	Ukufumana kulungile.
Finally he learned about it.	Ekugqibeleni wafunda ngayo.
I could no longer speak	Khange ndiphinde ndikwazi ukuthetha
So yes.	Ngoko ewe.
I deserve to be a friend.	Ndifanele ukuba ngumhlobo.
He said he would try to come.	Wathi uza kuzama ukuza.
I want to succeed here	Ndifuna ukuphumelela apha
I didn't want to talk about it	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha ngaloo nto
I can tell you.	Inokuba ndikuxelele.
I don't want to be anything.	Andifuni kuba nantoni na.
You can be really angry, too.	Unokuba nomsindo ngokwenene, naye.
And it could be too.	Kwaye inokuba kwakhona.
I wanted to die right away	Ndandifuna ukufa ngoko nangoko
I didn't look at anyone else.	Khange ndijonge omnye umntu.
I'm not even sure if it's right.	Nam andiqinisekanga ukuba ilungile.
I can't tell you everything	Andikwazi ukukuxelela yonke into
I want to know if you did	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba uyenzile na
One book to find.	Incwadi enye ukufumana.
She is fine with the children.	Uhleli kakuhle nabantwana.
He did not know what was going on here.	Wayengazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
I do not know exactly what will happen next.	Andazi ngokupheleleyo ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
I want to stay here.	Ndifuna ukuhlala apha.
I know it is very good	Ndiyazi ukuba kuhle kakhulu
I want to eat someone here	Ndifuna ukutya umntu apha
I had to do something else	Kwafuneka ndenze enye into
I did not know why he was coming	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni eze
I did that with you today	Ndenze lonto nawe namhlanje
And you can't go outside.	Kwaye awukwazi ukuhamba ngaphandle.
I don't know what I want here.	Andazi ukuba ndifuna ntoni apha.
I can't keep thinking about all this	Andikwazi ukuhlala ndicinga ngayo yonke le nto
I stared at it for a long time	Ndijonge apho ixesha elide
Clearly, I was doing the wrong thing.	Kucacile ukuba ndenza into engalunganga.
And you can get better.	Kwaye unokuba ngcono.
So far, however, everything is fine.	Okwangoku, nangona kunjalo, konke kulungile.
I know you think so	Ndiyazi ukuba ucinga oko
But this can really happen.	Kodwa oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I hesitate before I speak again	Ndiyathandabuza phambi kokuba ndithethe kwakhona
How good would that be ?.	Bekuya kuba kuhle kangakanani oko?.
I needed help	Bendifuna uncedo
I can't be in two places at the same time	Andikwazi ukuba kwindawo ezimbini ngexesha elinye
But do not forget to get out.	Kodwa ungalibali ukuphuma phandle.
I can read.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda.
But not your daughter.	Kodwa hayi intombi yakho.
I knew there was no reason	Ndandisazi ukuba kwakungekho sizathu
He knew it was true.	Wayesazi ukuba yinyani.
He said maybe so.	Wathi mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Everything like that.	Yonke into enjalo.
He decided to try again.	Wagqiba ekubeni azame kwakhona.
He all went in.	Wangena wonke.
I know what's going on.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I thought there was something wrong with you.	Bendicinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga kuwe.
I do not really understand	Andiqondi ngokwenene
I just wanted my time	Bendifuna nje ixesha lam
But you have to be beautiful.	Kodwa kufuneka ube mhle.
One was no return.	Enye kwakungekho kubuya.
I don’t know what happened to him after that	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye emva koko
What's the matter?.	Yintoni ingxaki?.
I knew it wouldn't be fun, but	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kuba mnandi, kodwa
Almost, but not exactly.	Phantse, kodwa hayi ncam.
He knew nothing about her.	Wayengazi nto ngaye.
I didn't do it.	Khange ndiyenze.
I want you to stay that way	Ndifuna uhlale unjalo
He thought.	Wacinga.
So it's not there.	Ngoko ke akukho apho.
I made it happen.	Ndenze ukuba kwenzeke.
I need to get there right away	Kufuneka ndiye khona ngoko nangoko
But it did not happen to anyone.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke kuye nabani na.
I'm not sure what you did with it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze ntoni ngayo.
That would be a real thing.	Oko bekuya kuba yinto ngokwenene.
I think only two.	Ndicinga ezimbini kuphela.
I will not try, for sure	Andiyi kuzama, ngokuqinisekileyo
It seems like you know everyone.	Kubonakala ngathi wazi wonke umntu.
Nothing, however, seemed.	Kwakungekho nto, nangona kunjalo, kwakubonakala.
Maybe I need more time.	Mhlawumbi ndifuna ixesha elingakumbi.
Doing so is not necessary.	Ukwenjenjalo akuyomfuneko.
I can't help it though	Andikwazi ukuzibamba kodwa
He does that every day.	Wenza loo nto yonke imihla.
You can be whatever you want to be.	Unokuba yiyo nantoni na ofuna ukuba yiyo.
He used to be.	Wayedla ngokuba njalo.
Anyone but me.	Nabani na ngaphandle kwam.
How so.	Njani kakhulu.
I have never been like that to you!	Andizange ndibe njalo kuwe!
There are children.	Kukho abantwana.
I wanted you to know what happened	Bendifuna uyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I have to help with that	Ndifanele ukunceda kuloo nto
But he did, of course.	Kodwa wayenza, kunjalo.
Another had to go to the hospital.	Omnye kwafuneka aye esibhedlele.
And, and, and.	Kwaye, kwaye, kwaye.
He is very similar to her.	Ufana naye kakhulu.
I wanted my place.	Ndandifuna indawo yam.
You will have to talk a lot.	Kuya kufuneka uthethe kakhulu.
Or make time.	Okanye wenze ixesha.
I did not wait	Khange ndilinde
That afternoon.	Ngaloo mvakwemini.
Yes, you are lucky.	Ewe, unethamsanqa.
It should have been so.	Bekufanele ukuba kube njalo.
He doesn't want to do it.	Akafuni ukuyenza.
Everyone stayed in that job.	Wonke umntu wahlala kuloo msebenzi.
As everyone does, really.	Njengoko wonke umntu esenza, ngokwenene.
You can't tell unless you know.	Awukwazi ukuxelela ngaphandle kokuba uyazi.
I told him he wanted more people	Ndamxelela ukuba ufuna abantu abaninzi
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu .
Almost no one did that.	Phantse akukho mntu wakwenza oko.
I can see when you do it	Ndiyakwazi ukubona xa uyenza
However there is one exception.	Nangona kunjalo kukho enye ngaphandle.
Everything, everything, everything.	Konke, konke, konke.
I have been both.	Ndibe bobabini.
I need to be with you now	Kufuneka ndibe nawe ngoku
I want you to have it now	Ndifuna ube nayo ngoku
I don't believe he can do this	Andikholelwa ukuba angayenza le nto
What happened next	Kwenzeka ntoni emva koko
If you feel like us.	Ukuba uziva ngathi.
He went the way he wanted to go	Wahamba ngendlela afuna ukuhamba ngayo
I want to stay	Ndifuna ukuhlala
Look at my house.	Jonga indlu yam.
No food for two days	Akukho kutya iintsuku ezimbini
Definitely makes you think.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukwenza ukuba ucinge.
I had no idea what had happened	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I don't even think that's right.	Andiqondi nokuba ilungile loo nto.
I don’t know how you learn to do that	Andazi ukuba ufunda njani ukuyenza loo nto
I'm always here, if you want to talk or whatever.	Ndihlala ndilapha, ukuba ufuna ukuthetha okanye nantoni na.
Everyone has it.	Wonke umntu unayo.
Lifelong learning.	Ukufunda ubomi bonke.
Or you may have.	Okanye uye waba.
Everyone thinks so.	Wonke umntu ucinga njalo.
I definitely wanted to do that	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandifuna ukwenza njalo
I don't even know if you play music.	Andazi nokuba udlala umculo.
I hope you go to jail	Ndiyathemba uya entolongweni
But it's you now.	Kodwa nguwe ngoku.
However, he continued.	Nangona kunjalo, waqhubeka.
I had to have it	Kwafuneka ndibe nayo
Speaking in class.	Ukuthetha eklasini.
And what's wrong with this.	Kwaye yintoni engalunganga ngale nto.
Not for long though.	Hayi ixesha elide kodwa.
I want this with you	Ndifuna oku nawe
Just how it could be	Kanye ukuba inokuba njani
No, he's not going anywhere.	Hayi, akayi ndawo.
Many hours.	Iiyure ezininzi.
I thought about something last night	Ndacinga ngento ebusuku
I feel inside of me.	Ndiziva ngaphakathi kum.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
Little did I know that food can be delicious	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ukutya kunokuba mnandi
Who are you thinking.	Ucinga bani.
You are doing well today.	Wenza kakuhle namhlanje.
There is much more.	Kukho okuninzi ngakumbi.
Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.	Hayi izolo, hayi ngomso, kodwa namhlanje.
I think he is determined	Ndicinga ukuba uzimisele
I don't know where my mother is	Andazi ukuba uphi umama
He came and sat down.	Wafika wahlala phantsi.
I told her that she did not have to do it	Ndamxelela ukuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba enjenjalo
You have to decide what you want to do.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo sokuba ufuna ukuyenza.
I think there is another way	Ndicinga ukuba kukho enye indlela
What you want and need to succeed.	Oko ufuna kwaye kufuneka uphumelele.
That means you have done this before.	Oko kuthetha ukuba wenze le nto ngaphambili.
Because you did it.	Ngenxa yokuba uyenzile.
I know she's tired	Ndiyamazi ukuba udiniwe
He really did.	Ngenene uyenzile.
I thought you knew	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi
He wants me to see.	Ufuna ndibone.
I'm looking for a cat	Ndijonge ikati
Obviously there is something wrong with it.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into engalunganga ngayo.
I love this approach	Ndiyayithanda le ndlela yokwenza
I saw him come out in front of me	Ndabona ukuphuma phambi kwam
I know you well enough	Ndikwazi kakuhle ngokwaneleyo
At first, he did very well.	Ekuqaleni, wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
The worst thing that ever happened.	Into embi engazange yenzeke.
A really big cat.	Ikati enkulu ngokwenene.
I wanted something other than him	Ndandifuna enye into ngaphandle kokuba naye
But he did not do this.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oku.
And he knew that.	Wayesazi ke loo nto.
Staying with me is very difficult.	Ukuhlala nam kunzima kakhulu.
Almost all of us, but not all of us.	Phantse sonke, kodwa hayi sonke.
I know that all is well with her	Ndiyazi ukuba konke kulungile kuye
No, not again.	Akunjalo, hayi kwakhona.
I tried to imagine what that would be like	Ndazama ukucinga ukuba kumele kube njani oko
I hope they will stay together.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuhlala kunye.
It just happened the other day.	Kwenzeka nje ngenye imini.
If you're scared, fine.	Ukuba uyoyika, kulungile.
Then, he looked down.	Emva koko, wajonga phantsi.
Everyone went back to bed.	Wonke umntu wabuyela ebhedini.
But there is more to this book.	Kodwa kukho enye into ngale ncwadi.
I couldn’t do it for him	Andikwazanga ukuyenza kuye
Again, this is just this week.	Kwakhona, oku kule veki nje.
We know what it is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Maybe you look inside.	Mhlawumbi ujonge ngaphakathi.
I could not succeed	Andizange ndikwazi ukuphumelela
I wanted to be myself again	Ndandifuna ukuba ndim kwakhona
And he died.	Waza wafa ke.
That is so until recently.	Oko kunjalo kude kube mva nje.
I know you will say no	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuthi hayi
I know this song, I know it well	Ndiyazi le ngoma, ndiyazi kakuhle
You will be really good at that.	Uya kuba ulungile ngokwenene kuloo nto.
In the evening, it is not.	Ngokuhlwa, akunjalo.
Surely that is clear.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kucacile.
Obviously it can be.	Ngokucacileyo inokuba njalo.
This time, you are lucky.	Ngeli xesha, unethamsanqa.
Nothing one or the other.	Akukho nto enye okanye enye.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.	Ewe, ewe, kunjalo.
I did everything well	Ndenze yonke into kakuhle
It seemed like you were playing with it.	Kwakubonakala ngathi udlala ngayo.
So don't do it.	Ngoko musa ukuyenza.
He is here, not there.	Ulapha, hayi phaya.
I feel tired and exhausted.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe kwaye ndidiniwe.
I really wanted to talk	Ndandifuna nyani ukuthetha
Thinking about you	Ndicinga ngawe
Then he became a man.	Emva koko waba ngumntu.
Is that you.	Ngaba nguwe.
I hope you can do that, too	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza loo nto, nawe

I can't tell you	Andikwazi ukukuxelela
I do not remember what happened next.	Andikhumbuli ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
I think we'll see	Ndicinga ukuba siza kubona
You deserve but where you are.	Ufanele kodwa uphi.
Look things up.	Jonga izinto phezulu.
I knew he was coming	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuza
I did a little bit about it.	Ndenze kancinci ngayo.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu wenza.
I wanted to learn more	Ndandifuna ukufunda kakhulu
He knew it would be so.	Wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
She will never think about him.	Soze acinge ngaye.
I will not say that.	Andiyi kuthetha loo nto.
I can't stay long	Andikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide
One, maybe not.	Enye, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
And good work on this.	Kwaye umsebenzi omhle kule nto.
It is clear why you are here.	Kucacile ukuba kutheni ulapha.
This certainly means a few things.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo kuthetha izinto ezimbalwa.

It's okay to take.	Kulungile ukuthatha.
I just want to know what I did	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba ndenze ntoni

Me and my friends.	Mna nabahlobo bam.
That's the thing.	Nantso into.
Of course everyone does.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wonke umntu uyayenza.
A few other things.	Ezinye izinto ezimbalwa.
I had to go to him	Kwafuneka ndiye kuye
Every reason more to do it	Sonke isizathu ngakumbi ukuyenza
I have never seen him like that	Andizange ndimbone ngolo hlobo
Do not make money from it.	Musa ukwenza imali ngayo.
That's fast enough.	Oko ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
I did not look for time	Khange ndijonge ixesha
I look after my parents	Ndijonge abazali bam
Now he looked better.	Ngoku wayekhangeleka engcono.
He is playing with you.	Udlala ngawe.

They have lived there until now.	Baye bahlala apho kude kube ngoku.
I would like to see more.	Ndingathanda ukubona ngakumbi.
It is good to talk.	Kuhle ukuthetha.
Everything is made of one thing.	Yonke into yenziwe ngento enye.
And you can't go home, either.	Kwaye awukwazi ukuya ekhaya, nawe.
You can be very difficult.	Unokuba nzima kakhulu.
So, he did.	Ngoko, uyenzile.
I did not want him to be human	Ndandingafuni abe ngumntu
Saying two things.	Ethetha izinto ezimbini.
I wonder if you know	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uyazi na

I didn't see him very much	Khange ndimbone kakhulu
I have done that so far	Ndiyenzile loo nto kude kube ngoku
Or other things.	Okanye ezinye izinto.

Do you think that.	Ucinga ukuba.

At first, but then.	Ekuqaleni, kodwa emva koko.
That's all.	Yiloo nto kuphela.
That's wrong.	Nantso into engalunganga.

I think it's time though	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha kodwa
I got home last night tired	Ndifike endlini phezolo ndidiniwe

Glad to know what you think.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I did not want to get angry	Ndandingafuni ukuba nomsindo
Otherwise, sorry.	Ngaphandle koko, uxolo.
I want you to stay too	Nam ndifuna uhlale
You will see, you will do something wrong in the end.	Uya kubona, uya kwenza into engalunganga ekugqibeleni.
I wanted you to know that	Bendifuna uyazi lonto
He certainly did, and he came in.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wenza, kwaye wangena.

There is a good chance for you.	Kukho ithuba elihle kuwe.
But it seemed okay.	Kodwa kwakubonakala kulungile.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
What he wants he does not know.	Into ayifunayo akayazi.

It takes time to complete.	Kuthatha ixesha ukugqiba.
Just my name, not something else.	Igama lam nje, hayi enye into.
I didn't know that at first	Bendingayazi lonto ekuqaleni

If it goes away.	Ukuba iya kude.
It could be anything.	Inokuba yintoni na.
I also can't get out	Nam andikwazi ukuphuma

I love the way he learned so quickly, everything	Ndiyayithanda indlela afunde ngayo ngokukhawuleza, yonke into
But not at all.	Kodwa hayi kwaphela.

I live within you	Ndihlala ngaphakathi kuwe
I wanted to know everything	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into
And he says for sure.	Kwaye uthi ngokuqinisekileyo.
What, of course.	Ntoni na, kunjalo.
And all that.	Kunye nayo yonke loo nto.
Her father works here.	Utata wakhe usebenza apha.
To me he is like that.	Kum unjalo.
If anyone knows.	Ukuba umntu uyazi.
Really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
If so, nothing.	Ukuba kunjalo, akukho nto.
He did to me.	Wenza kum.
Learning does it.	Ukufunda kukwenza.
I wanted to tell you about it	Bendifuna ukukuxelela ngaloo nto
He walked quickly, probably.	Wahamba ngokukhawuleza, mhlawumbi.
Don't hold back.	Musa ukuzibamba.

What he knew.	Oko wayesazi.
But he did not go.	Kodwa akazange aye.
I can work on this	Ndiyakwazi ukusebenza ngale nto
Sounds good to me but it isn't.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile kum kodwa akunjalo.
I just wanted to stay.	Ndandifuna nje ukuhlala.
I didn't know if it was right or not	Bendingazi noba ilungile okanye hayi
It is very difficult to imagine what that could be.	Kunzima kakhulu ukucinga ukuba inokuba njani loo nto.
There is something there.	Kukho into phaya.
I want to tell you a story.	Ndifuna ukukuxelela ibali.
Here you have your thing.	Apha unayo into yakho.
I will speak.	Ndiza kuthetha.
He lived with her for a few years.	Wahlala naye iminyaka embalwa.
You are right.	Ulungile wena.
It will be with you for the rest of your life.	Kuya kuba nawe ubomi bakho bonke.
No one is good.	Akukho mntu ulungile.
Not so much at this time.	Hayi kakhulu ngeli xesha.
I had to look at the big picture.	Kwafuneka ndijonge umfanekiso omkhulu.
I know your place	Ndiyayazi indawo yakho
I want to come to you home	Ndifuna ukuza kuwe ekhaya
I never thought what would happen next	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni emva koko
Yes, or otherwise.	Ewe, okanye ngenye indlela.
Another time.	Elinye ixesha.
I know better though	Ndiyazi ngcono nangona kunjalo
Her father did so.	Utata wakhe wenza njalo.
Work came first.	Umsebenzi weza kuqala.
I really want to do the right thing	Ndifuna ngamandla ukwenza into elungileyo
Then he knew nothing.	Emva koko wayengazi nto.
Long, long ago.	Kudala, kudala.
But he is not much better.	Kodwa akakho ngcono kakhulu.
I'm really sorry about that	Ndiyaxolisa ngenene ngaloo nto
I know it has to be.	Ndiyazi ukuba kumele kube njalo.
I don't know why	Andazi ukuba kutheni
There is nothing more to it.	Akukho nto ngakumbi kuyo.
No one told me about it	Akukho mntu wandixelela ngayo
You are smarter than I am.	Ukrelekrele kunam.
Don't go there just yet.	Musa ukuya apho okwangoku.
Now, or anytime.	Ngoku, okanye nanini na.
I will come to you soon	Ndiza kuza kuwe kungekudala
It would seem to be something that is happening here.	Kuya kubonakala ukuba yinto eyenzekayo apha.
In this way.	Kule ndlela.
So I ask for help.	Ngoko ndicela uncedo.
I'm sure it's okay.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kulungile.
Maybe I was never alone with him	Mhlawumbi andizange ndibe ndedwa kunye naye
I just want time to be a little alone	Ndifuna nje ixesha lokuba ndedwa kancinci
The car is very good.	Imoto ilungile kakhulu.
She likes to be alone.	Uthanda ukuhlala yedwa.
This has to happen.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke.
I don't know what you think	Andazi ukuba ucinga ntoni
My mother never said anything about it, and no one else did.	Umama akazange athethe ngale nto, kwaye akukho namnye umntu.
I want to talk to you about him	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe ngaye
He went inside and asked to see the book.	Wangena ngaphakathi waza wacela ukubona loo ncwadi.
I hope your stay here is okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ukuhlala kwakho apha kulungile.
I thought you should know.	Ndacinga ukuba ufanele ukwazi.
I don't know which way	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi na indlela

I had no idea what was going on	Ndandingazi nokuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I know you won't have that	Ndiyazi ukuba awuyi kuba nayo loo nto
I know there is more to it than that	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho ngaphezu koko
I want to think about it	Ndifuna ukucinga ngayo
No one wants to drive too fast.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza.
I didn't tell him much	Khange ndimxelele kakhulu
All right, one day.	Kulungile, ngenye imini.
Some that he can not.	Abanye ukuba akakwazi.
I know you know that too.	Ndiyazi ukuba nawe uyakwazi oko.
Do you .	Uya .
You feel completely better.	Uziva engcono ngokupheleleyo.
I knew he would like to	Ndandisazi ukuba angathanda
I'll be back	Ndiza kubuya
I did not see him when he left	Khange ndimbone noba uhambe nini
I'll have to get better at it	Kuya kufuneka ndibe ngcono kuyo
But we did not do that.	Kodwa asizange senze loo nto.
I told you what this is	Ndikuxelele ukuba yintoni le
I wanted to play now	Bendifuna ukudlala ngoku
I just want to do everything	Ndifuna nje ukwenza yonke into
He does not go to school.	Akayi esikolweni.
He is the only one who comes to me at this time.	Nguye kuphela oza kum ngeli xesha.
Clearly, he was not at work.	Kucacile ukuba wayengekho emsebenzini.
Learning anything new is difficult.	Ukufunda nantoni na entsha kunzima.
Not bad, this time.	Hayi embi, ngeli xesha.
To you or anyone.	Kuwe okanye nabani na.
But first about me.	Kodwa kuqala malunga nam.
He is not, however.	Akanjalo, nangona kunjalo.
I knew nothing about it	Ndandingazi nto ngayo yonke loo nto
I don't believe you do this to me	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenza le nto kum
That would be a good thing.	Bekuya kuba yinto elungileyo leyo.
I just want to play	Ndifuna nje ukudlala
And every morning.	Kwaye rhoqo kusasa.
I just wanted to keep thinking	Bendifuna nje ukuhlala ndicinge
I was just thinking about it	Bendicinga nje ngayo
So, that's it.	Ngoko, yiloo nto.
I think that would be great.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kuba kuhle.
No thanks, she finished.	Hayi enkosi, wagqiba.
I will not speak again	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe
I can't go to it	Andikwazi ukuya kuyo
One day he found his mother.	Ngenye imini wafumana umama wakhe.
I wanted something to do	Ndandifuna into yokwenza
Yeah, this is the thing.	Ewe, le yinto.
He almost did not speak at this time.	Phantse akazange athethe ngeli xesha.
As maybe one or two.	Njengokuba mhlawumbi enye okanye ezimbini.
I don't know how that happened	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko
And you certainly have come.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo uze.
Not wanting to succeed.	Hayi ofuna ukuphumelela.
Great thing, really	Into enkulu, ngokwenene
You will find some books there.	Uya kufumana ezinye iincwadi apho.
I didn't know what to do about it	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto

I could not quit this job	Andikwazanga ukuyeka lo msebenzi
I hope this is good for you	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kulungile kuwe
A little, but not bad	Kancinci, kodwa hayi kakubi
It can be really good.	Kunokuba kuhle ngokwenene.
However, everything else? 	Nangona kunjalo, yonke enye into?
I just know it's true	Ndiyazi nje ukuba yinyani
I'll get that for you.	Ndiza kufumana ukuba kuwe.
There is that.	Kukho loo nto.
And then you want it to happen really quickly.	Kwaye ke ufuna ukuba kwenzeke ngokwenene ngokukhawuleza.
If there is such a thing.	Ukuba kukho into enjalo.
I did not do much at first	Andizange ndenze nto ingako ekuqaleni
It's a long time ago	Kudala kudala
He may simply have wanted a job.	Usenokuba wayefuna umsebenzi kuphela.
Right here and now.	Kanye apha kwaye ngoku.
Me, not well.	Mna, hayi kakuhle.
Well, of course, we'll do that.	Ke, kunjalo, siza kuyenza loo nto.
She likes to sit out there and read before dinner.	Uthanda ukuhlala phaya phandle afunde phambi kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
I went the same way for you.	Ndihambe ngendlela efanayo kuwe.
Someone is doing this.	Kukho umntu owenza oku.
I want to sit down and do it	Ndifuna ukuhlala phantsi ndiyenze
Now I have to do it.	Ngoku kufuneka ndenze njalo.
He said he looked better.	Wathi ubonakala engcono.

I do not know how this came about.	Andazi ukuba kuza njani oku.
I could not do anything without you	Andikwazanga ukwenza nantoni na ngaphandle kwakho
I'm late, too	Ndifike emva kwexesha, kakhulu
I made a mistake	Ndenze impazamo
It was very visible.	Kwakubonakala kakhulu.
I certainly do not want to be like that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andifuni kuba njalo.
Nice there.	Entle phaya.
And, we did.	Kwaye, senze.
His way of doing that.	Indlela yakhe yokwenza oko.
Not another word.	Hayi elinye igama.
I want you to think about it	Ndifuna ucinge ngayo
This, however, should not be easy.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akufuneki kube lula.
So he spoke.	Uye wathetha ke.
So look at it now.	Ngoko jonga kuyo ngoku.
I wonder if he will ever do that	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uya kuze enze njalo na
I'm definitely not at work	Ngokuqinisekileyo andikho emsebenzini
I can't wait to learn farther away from you	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda kude ngakumbi kuwe
I certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyenzile.
And look at me now.	Ndijonge ke ngoku.
This is probably the case here.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba oku kunjalo apha.
I don't see a problem.	Andiboni ngxaki.
Look like that.	Jonga ngolo hlobo.
I will say more about this later	Ndiza kuthetha ngakumbi oku kamva
I'm doing a lot of that now.	Ndenza okuninzi koko ngoku.
I looked out.	Ndijonge ngaphandle.
But he is not a single person.	Kodwa akangomntu omnye.
And he did the right thing.	Kwaye wenza into elungileyo.
I was just thinking one thing about you	Bendicinga into enye nje ngawe
I knew he was going to be down	Bendisazi ukuba uzakuba phantsi
I wanted to be with him	Bendifuna ukuba naye
I can't do it right now	Andikwazi ukuyenza okwangoku
I did a good thing	Ndenze into entle
Many weeks.	Iiveki ezininzi.
He spent many hours alone in his room.	Wachitha iiyure ezininzi yedwa kwigumbi lakhe.
John thought so too.	NoJohn wayecinga njalo.
I want to work with him	Ndifuna ukusebenza naye
That's why we have to go.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka sihambe.
I didn't say anything to her about it	Khange ndithethe nto kuye ngalonto
No, no no! 	Hayi, hayi hayi!
I have no such problem	Andinayo ingxaki enjalo
He loves it too.	Naye uyayithanda.
I have never done that before	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili
I think that will only continue	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kuqhubeka kuphela
I don't even care.	Andikhathali nokuba.
I want to tell my friends.	Ndifuna ukuxelela abahlobo bam.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kube njalo.
I could not say it	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyithetha
I think so	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo
He thought it was clear.	Wayecinga ukuba kucacile.
All the way done.	Yonke indlela yenziwe.
I just know it's done	Ndiyazi nje ukuba yenziwe
Nobody did anything wrong.	Akukho mntu wenze into embi.
But you are not going.	Kodwa awuyi.
A woman came to me one day	Omnye umfazi weza kum ngenye imini
I did not want to go there with him	Ndandingafuni ukuya naye apho
So I never talked about it	Ngoko ke andizange ndithethe ngayo
The same thing happened next month.	Kwenzeka into efanayo kwinyanga ezayo.
I will never go there again	Andisayi kuphinda ndiye apho
Soon he came.	Khange kube kudala weza.
I wanted to meet you soon	Bendifuna ukudibana nawe kungekudala
He's been there ever since.	Uhleli apho ukusukela ngoko.
I want you out here.	Ndifuna ulapha phandle.
I love that song.	Ndiyayithanda loo ngoma.
I should have apologized to you	Bekufanele ukuba ndicela uxolo kuwe
That requires space.	Oko kufuna indawo.
This seems possible.	Oku kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
I'm just telling the truth	Ndithetha inyaniso nje
I will not try this week	Andiyi kuzama kule veki
Maybe even a new friend.	Mhlawumbi nokuba ngumhlobo omtsha.
And here you will be very happy.	Kwaye apha uya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
So there was nobody there.	Ngoko kwakungekho mntu.
I think you want to swim	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ukuqubha
I thought about you a lot, too.	Ndicinge ngawe kakhulu, nam.
I just thought.	Ndacinga nje.
I never saw better.	Andizange ndibone ngcono.
You can say if you want to.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha ukuba uyafuna.
I thought it was very good	Bendicinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu

You know, food.	Uyazi, ukutya.
Then he thought better of it.	Emva koko wacinga ngcono ngayo.
This is all my thing.	Yiyo yonke into yam le.
I had no idea what had happened, and why	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni, nokuba kwakutheni
As long as you play, he won't leave.	Ukuba nje udlala, akayi kuhamba.
It will be much better where you go.	Kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu apho uya khona.
I wanted something new	Ndandifuna into entsha
He told her no.	Wamxelela ukuba hayi.
Now there is something else.	Ngoku kukho enye into.
You know you're out now.	Uyayazi ukuba ulapha phandle ngoku.
But something is wrong.	Kodwa kukho into engalunganga.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube ngoku.
I thought of something a little different	Ndiye ndacinga ngenye into encinci
I think you have it too	Ndicinga ukuba nawe unayo
I really want to quit	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyeka
I want to go find my dad	Ndifuna ukuya kufuna utata wam

I hope they come back	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kubuya
He didn’t leave for long, though.	Akazange ahambe ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
And so it is with me.	Kwaye kunjalo yam.
I wanted to do this	Bendifuna ukuyenza le nto
Just this way.	Kanye ngale ndlela.
I never thought of that	Khange ndicinge ngolo hlobo
So to tell you.	Ngoko ukuxelela.
I hope all is well with him	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kulungile naye
I never thought it was true	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinyani
That means work.	Oko kuthetha umsebenzi.
I know what this is all about	Ndiyayazi into eyenziwa yile nto
He does not know what is happening to you.	Akayazi into eyenzekayo kuwe.
That is how it should be with reading.	Kufuneka kube njalo ke ukufunda.
Man right up there.	Umntu kanye phezulu.
I did not go to him	Khange ndiye kuye
I like it here	Ndiyayithanda apha
Impossible, no one will say.	Akunakwenzeka, umntu akayi kuthetha.
I'm talking about something that happened to us.	Ndithetha ngento eyenzekayo kuthi.
We will do one at a time.	Siza kwenza enye ngexesha.
I wanted to do it here	Bendifuna ukuyenza apha
I have to play.	Ndifanele ukudlala.
You know more, too.	Uyazi ngakumbi, naye.
I never did my homework	Zange ndenze umsebenzi wesikolo
Now, we'll do that.	Ngoku, siza kwenza njalo.
He did not know what to expect.	Wayengazi ukuba unethemba ntoni.
Then, just go.	Emva koko, uhambe nje.
I mean, though, two things	Ndithetha, nangona kunjalo, izinto ezimbini
I better go home	Kungcono ndiye ekhaya
Umpu.	Umpu .
This, however, should not be the case for you.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akufuneki kube njalo kuwe.
No one knew what to do with it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
I will do anything to be with you	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na ukuze ndibe nawe
You've done enough.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo.
You do not have to do it the right way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oko ngendlela.

You know my place.	Uyayazi indawo yam.
The police quickly learned that.	Amapolisa afunde ngokukhawuleza oko.
This one did.	Lo wenza.
I'm not sure which one, to be honest.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yeyiphi, xa ndithetha inyani.
Is everyone interested ?.	Ngaba wonke umntu unomdla?.

But others.	Kodwa abanye.
I don't know where the other person lives	Andazi ukuba omnye umntu uhlala phi
No, but it is very good.	Akunjalo, kodwa kuhle kakhulu.
I really got home	Ndifike ekhaya nyani
Help me now.	Ndincede ngoku.
Or your mother.	Okanye umama wakho.

Can someone please.	Ngaba umntu nceda.
Don't think of him.	Musa ukucinga ngaye.

I know nothing	Andazi kwanto
And every time after that.	Kwaye lonke ixesha emva koko.
I decided to go there too	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndiye apho, nam

I wondered what it would be like to be with him	Ndacinga ukuba kuya kuba njani ukuhlala naye

I knew it was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba iza kufika.
And this is better.	Kwaye oku kungcono.

But other than that, he did well.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko, wenza kakuhle.
Please come to us immediately.	Nceda uze kuthi kwangoko.
But that will only be one thing.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba yinto enye kuphela.
I know what happened to you	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo kuwe
He began to study it.	Waqalisa ukufunda kuyo.
And you talk about it.	Kwaye uthetha ngayo.
He wanted to know and he did not want to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi kwaye wayengafuni ukwazi.
I certainly do not remember anyone	Ngokuqinisekileyo andikhumbuli namnye
Not so, not immediately.	Hayi ngoko, hayi ngoko nangoko.
We will do it tomorrow.	Siza kuyenza ngomso.
But he never, never made a mistake about me.	Kodwa akazange, soze enze impazamo ngam.
In one week.	Kwiveki enye.
Not a big deal.	Hayi into enkulu.
I finally know who she is	Ekugqibeleni ndiyamazi ukuba ngubani
But just a few weeks.	Kodwa iiveki nje ezimbalwa.
It is his job.	Ngumsebenzi wakhe.
I wanted to see there.	Bendifuna ukubona apho.
I don't know where he wanted to go.	Andazi ukuba wayefuna ukuya nayo phi.
I couldn't tell you what you did there	Andikwazanga ukukuxelela ukuba wenze ntoni apho
He just knew.	Wayesazi nje.
I apologize for all this.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke lento.
I could not control myself	Zange ndikwazi ukuzibamba
Not a bad mistake.	Hayi impazamo embi.
I will not go too far with that	Andiyi kuba kude kakhulu ngaloo nto

That's the way, he thought.	Nantso indlela, wacinga.
By work.	Ngomsebenzi.
I have to talk about something	Kufuneka ndithethe ngento ethile
Then you left.	Emva koko, nawe wemka.
I hope you feel better soon !.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ungcono kungekudala!.
Everyone wanted to help.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukunceda.
I just thought, you know	Bendicinga nje ukuba, uyazi
I don't think he will do anything.	Andiqondi ukuba uya kwenza nantoni na.
At first, he did not want to.	Ekuqaleni, wayengafuni.
What happens next, and what happens next, you want to know.	Yintoni eyenzekayo emva koko, kwaye kwenzeka ntoni emva koko, ufuna ukwazi.
He said he plans to get a new one.	Uthe uceba ukufumana entsha.
I did not live alone	Andizange ndihlale ndedwa
I want children too.	Ndifuna nabantwana.
You are better.	Ungcono.
Maybe you went out with him.	Mhlawumbi uye waphuma naye.
All right kids.	Kulungile abantwana.
But we should have done something like that.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba senze into enje.
I want something big with you	Ndifuna into enkulu nawe
I hope you will be back soon	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kubuya kungekudala
I really want to know.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
I didn’t, not really.	Andizange, hayi ngokwenene.
And maybe again.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kwakhona.
It would have to be.	Bekuya kufuneka.
You feel trouble right away.	Uziva unengxaki ngoko nangoko.
I can't think it's over	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba phezulu
I want your whole life	Ndifuna ubomi bakho bonke
I want to know everything	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into
But how do I do this ?.	Kodwa ndiyenza njani lento?.
I can't help you much with this	Andikwazi ukukunceda kakhulu ngale
At first, there was no problem.	Ekuqaleni, kwakungekho ngxaki.
I did not go far though	Andizange ndiye kude kodwa
So we have to make a decision.	Ngoko ke kufuneka senze isigqibo.
I'm so sorry, this is exactly it	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu, nguye kanye lo
To be very good.	Ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
It is a very big job.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu.
He knew nothing more.	Wayengazi nto ngakumbi.
I tried one right away	Ndazama enye ngoko nangoko
I was not really thinking at the time	Ndandingacingi ncam ngelo xesha
He is good to you.	Ulungile kuwe.
I know there are others	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho abanye
He looked down at his bedroom.	Wajonga phantsi kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
But I'm not so sure.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga ngolo hlobo.
I'll get to that later.	Ndiza kuloo nto emva kwexesha.
Your mother is here.	Umama wakho ulapha.
I hope you feel that way	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngolo hlobo
And I, of course.	Kwaye mna, kunjalo.
You stay there, okay.	Uhlala apho, kulungile.
He did not address any such issues.	Zange athethe nayiphi na ingxaki enjalo.
And that takes time.	Kwaye oko kuthatha ixesha.
I did not want his money.	Ndandingafuni mali yakhe.
He learned nothing.	Akazange afunde nto.
Soon, not far away.	Kungekudala, hayi kude.
I sit on my bed and wait	Ndihlale ebhedini yam ndilinde
I don't believe in any of that.	Andikholelwa kuyo nayiphi na loo nto.
But there was no need.	Kodwa kwakungekho mfuneko.
This is good and right.	Oku kulungile kwaye kulungile.
So that's all.	Ngoko yiyo yonke loo nto.
We know what that is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni na loo nto.
I will never live there again	Andiyi kuphinda ndihlale apho
I know what you want to say	Ndiyayazi into ofuna ukuyithetha
I want to make music my whole life.	Ndifuna ukwenza umculo ubomi bam bonke.
I'm just happy.	Ndiyavuya nje.
We have to go at night.	Kufuneka sihambe ubusuku.
It's good for us.	Ilungile kuthi.
We go to it.	Siya kuyo.
You have to do it all.	Kufuneka wenze konke.
I'll talk to you now	Ndiya kuthetha nawe ngoku
I'm not sure about anything	Andiqinisekanga ngayo nantoni na
I am confident that I will succeed.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ndiza kuphumelela.
In the end, nothing happened.	Ekugqibeleni, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
I never did, of course.	Andizange ndiyenze, kunjalo.
You can do it too, you know.	Ungayenza nawe, uyazi.
I said nothing to her	Khange ndithethe nto kuye
It's just hard.	Kunzima nje.
I'm glad to have him here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba naye apha.
Time and time again	Ixesha kunye nexesha kwakhona
I could not go with it	Andikwazanga ukuhamba nayo
I wanted to know more, much more	Bendifuna ukwazi ngakumbi, kakhulu ngakumbi

If you are interested.	Ukuba unomdla.
You can't be.	Awukwazi ukuba.
He has done this whole book.	Uyenzile yonke le ncwadi.
I know it's hard for you	Ndiyazi kunzima kuwe

You should know this about me.	Ufanele ukwazi oku ngam.
I haven't talked to you about it	Khange ndithethe nawe ngayo
I did not want to tell you this	Bendingafuni ukukuxelela ngolu hlobo
Thinking about something.	Ukucinga ngento ethile.
He can't sit in front.	Akakwazi ukuhlala ngaphambili.
I don't care who did it, that's not it.	Andikhathali nokuba ngubani owenze loo nto, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
I wonder about it a lot	Ndiyazibuza malunga nayo kakhulu
And this !.	Kwaye oku!.
He did not want me to come.	Wayengafuni ndize.
My son is there.	Ukhona unyana wam.
Likely, you do too.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba, nawe wenza njalo.
People are work.	Abantu ngumsebenzi.
I'm not sure what's right.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni elungileyo.
Thank you very much	Enkosi kakhulu
Because it would make everyone think	Kuba bekuya kwenza wonke umntu acinge
I definitely thought it would be hard	Ndacinga ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kuya kuba nzima
That's an old thing.	Yinto endala leyo.
I went to him immediately	Ndiye kuye ngoko nangoko
But this is possible	Kodwa oku kunokwenzeka

You can be him.	Unokuba nguye.
I thought about you a lot, too	Ndicinge ngawe kakhulu, nam
You may be all of that.	Usenokuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
I told her that this was my job.	Ndamxelela ukuba ngumsebenzi wam lo.
Not now, not tonight.	Hayi ngoku, hayi ngokuhlwanje.
I do not know about this problem.	Andazi ngale ngxaki.

I did not tell you the whole truth	Andizange ndikuxelele yonke inyani
To do it.	Ukuyenza.
He looked and saw nothing.	Wajonga wabona kwanto.
Can't pick up your phone right now.	Akakwazi ukuthatha umnxeba wakho okwangoku.
I will do it clearly.	Ndiya kwenza ngokucacileyo.

I have never done anything like this before	Andizange ndenze into enje ngaphambili

I wanted to know what was going on and why.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kwaye kutheni.
I think that's a good idea.	Ndicinga ukuba licebo elihle.
But this will do the job.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenza umsebenzi.

That was a mistake made.	Yenziwe njalo ke impazamo.
I could not tell you before	Andikwazanga ukukuxelela ngaphambili
Yes, a week tomorrow.	Ewe, iveki ngomso.
He did not know what was happening in the area.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kule ndawo.

He has to go fast.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
Time to make money.	Ixesha lokwenza imali.
Well, so he wanted to.	Ewe, ngoko wayefuna.
I don't think anyone knew exactly what was going to happen.	Andiqondi ukuba akukho mntu wayesazi kakuhle ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
But not so with us.	Kodwa akunjalo ngathi.
I wonder if he does	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uyayenza na

I thought he did it himself	Ndandicinga ukuba uyenzile loo nto ngokwakhe
I think you are a good person	Ndicinga ukuba ungumntu olungileyo
There must be something wrong with me.	Kumele ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngam.
Look at this.	Ujonge oku.
Then we will come to a place.	Emva koko siya kufika kwindawo ethile.

I apologize for the way it looks	Ndicela uxolo ngendlela ebonakala ngayo
I don't know how you do that	Andiqondi ukuba uyenza njani loo nto
But very much so.	Kodwa kakhulu.
He left his house.	Waphuma endlwini yakhe.
Or a week.	Okanye iveki.
I was thinking a lot about that.	Bendicinga kakhulu ngalonto.
For others, it may be impossible.	Abanye, akunakwenzeka.

He is not real.	Akakho nyani.

I just want to do the job once.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi kube kanye.
I'm not saying he never tried	Andithi khange azame
More than that you will know.	Ngaphezu koko uya kukwazi.

I want you to know that	Ndifuna uyazi lonto

A cat will do such a thing	Ikati iya kwenza into enjalo
This makes it easy to think about.	Oku kwenza kube lula ukucinga ngayo.
I wonder what everyone is doing here at home	Ndiyazibuza ukuba wonke umntu wenza ntoni apha ekhaya
You know where you are looking.	Uyazi ukuba ujonge phi.
No one will come.	Akukho mntu uya kuza.
I didn't want to know what was going on	Bendingafuni ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I didn't do it either	Nam khange ndiyenze
He spent the night in jail.	Wachitha ubusuku entolongweni.
Thank you for being with me.	Enkosi ngokuba nam.
He slept with her in her room.	Walala naye egumbini lakhe.
I wonder what it might be	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba yintoni na

Talking to him.	Ukuthetha naye.
But you have to do things.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze izinto.
I feel so much better	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu
I can't believe he did this.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenzile le nto.
I mean he really said	Ndithetha nyani wathetha
I knew nothing inside	Ndandingazi nto ngaphakathi
I want to take it several times	Ndifuna ukuthatha izihlandlo ezininzi
He is very interested	Unomdla kakhulu
He went down again quickly.	Wehla kwakhona ngokukhawuleza.
I think everything.	Ndicinga yonke into.
I don't know anyone here	Andazi mntu apha
I did not go any further	Khange ndiye phambili
I have to do it with the right thing	Ndifanele ndiyenze ngento elungileyo
I just wish it was sooner than later	Ndinqwenela nje ukuba kube ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva
He thinks he is doing well.	Ucinga ukuba wenza kakuhle.
And, this is just one job.	Kwaye, lo ngumsebenzi omnye kuphela.
I wonder why that is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
I did not see him in his bedroom	Khange ndibone kwigumbi lakhe lokulala
And many more.	Kwaye abanye abaninzi.
I don't know what this is	Andazi ukuba yintoni na le
I think and I think and I think and I always think	Ndiyacinga kwaye ndicinge kwaye ndicinge kwaye ndihlale ndicinga
And not so much.	Kwaye hayi kakhulu.
I just tried to do a good job	Ndazama nje ukwenza umsebenzi olungileyo
I love what happened in that place.	Ndiyayithanda into eyenzekayo kuloo ndawo.
I went to his work	Ndaya emsebenzini wakhe

I thought it was him.	Ndandicinga ukuba nguye.
He said not much.	Wathi hayi kakhulu.
I think not so much	Ndicinga ukuba hayi kakhulu
But it always happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka njalo.
And then he knew.	Kwaye ke wayesazi.
I know what he did to you	Ndiyayazi into ayenzileyo kuwe
You know, the big thing.	Uyazi, into enkulu.
But he too could not stop.	Kodwa naye akazange akwazi ukuyeka.
After you leave.	Emva kokuba uhambe.
I did not know this.	Bendingayazi le nto.
His work came first.	Umsebenzi wakhe weza kuqala.
I don't know where they went	Andazi ukuba baye phi
But it was not enough.	Kodwa kwakungekho ngokwaneleyo.
This will not be easy.	Oku akuyi kuba lula.
He loves money.	Uyayithanda imali.
We will do that again.	Siza kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
I thought you had a problem	Ndandicinga ukuba unengxaki
I want to know everything now	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into ngoku
Did you go.	Ngaba uye.
He should not have done that.	Akufunekanga ayenze loo nto.
To do so.	Ukwenza njalo.
One more thing for me.	Enye into ngakumbi kum.
Or somewhere there.	Okanye kwindawo ethile apho.
But still, it is not possible.	Kodwa kunjalo, akunakwenzeka.
Or a test.	Okanye uvavanyo.
I would like to stay there.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apho.
I did not want him to go with me	Bendingafuni ahambe nam
I am here for you when you are right.	Ndilapha kuwe xa ulungile.
This is something new for him.	Le yinto entsha kuye.
Give me my name.	Ndinike igama lam.
Impossible, but it is.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kunjalo.
I never thought it could be	Andizange ndicinge ukuba inokuba yintoni
I'm looking at you.	Ndijonge wena.
I can't wait to get home	Andikwazi ukulinda ukufika ekhaya
How can it be.	Inokuba njani.
And he is sure.	Kwaye uqinisekile.
I'm not sure what his problem is	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe
Now it could be one or two things.	Ngoku inokuba yinto enye okanye ezimbini.
I want to go home.	Ndifuna agoduke.
Maybe looking to get out.	Mhlawumbi ujonge ukuphuma.
You do not have to decide now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoku.
I don't know what happened	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I wanted to come here	Bendifuna ukuza apha
I didn't even know you were here	Bendingazi nokuba ulapha
I could have done something better	Inokuba ndenze into entle
And let the man sit down.	Uze ahlale phantsi umntu.
Maybe one day you will want to meet him.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini uya kufuna ukudibana naye.
You never saw it.	Zange wabona.
I can't think of all this right now	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo yonke le nto ngoku
That's a very old thing.	Yinto endala kakhulu leyo.
I do not believe there is another	Andikholelwa ukuba kukho enye
He knew though.	Wayesazi nangona kunjalo.
I'm looking at your picture now	Ndijonge umfanekiso wakho ngoku
I already know, very much, what is going on	Sele ndiyazi, kakhulu, ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I thought of staying reading.	Ndacinga ukuhlala ndifunde.
Then we will see what happens	Emva koko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni
I really know that	Ndiyazi ngokwenene loo nto
However.	Kodwa ke .
Learning music.	Ukufunda umculo.
A little earlier than he wanted	Kancinci ngaphambili kunokuba wayefuna
I could not be there for long	Andikwazanga ukuba lapho ixesha elide
I think that's the only thing you have to do	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile
I want it done quickly	Ndifuna ukuba yenziwe ngokukhawuleza
And he walks slowly.	Kwaye uhamba kancinci.
You won.	Uphumelele.
But how did that happen.	Kodwa ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
We need to do that first.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto kuqala.
And this morning.	Kwaye ngale ntsasa.
I'm sure you will do well.	Ndiqinisekile uya kwenza kakuhle.
No one wants to die like that.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukufa ngolo hlobo.
I want you to do something	Ndifuna ukuba wenze into
I think he has fallen asleep	Ndicinga ukuba uye walala
I guess I don’t know what it is every day	Ndicinga ukuba andazi ukuba yintoni yonke imihla
If not, there is no reason.	Ukuba akunjalo, akukho sizathu.
I didn't know it was him	Bendingazi ukuba nguye
He died suddenly.	Wafa ngokukhawuleza.
I think you better go with me now	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono uhambe nam ngoku
Many, many hours.	Iiyure ezininzi, ezininzi.
I'm looking for death.	Ndijonge ukufa.
You do your thing.	Uyayenza into yakho.
And everyone has it.	Kwaye wonke umntu unayo.
That will happen later.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kamva.
This is really good.	Oku kuhle ngokwenene.
It could be, of course.	Inokuba, kunjalo.
I personally did not see any problem with this	Mna ngokwam andizange ndibone ngxaki ngale nto
I like the way you play.	Ndiyayithanda indlela yokudlala.
All in all, nothing.	Konke, akukho nto.
He almost died.	Uphantse wafa.
I live there.	Ndihlala khona .
Finally he made a decision.	Ekugqibeleni wenza isigqibo.
I'm here too now.	Ndilapha nam ngoku.
I can't play with any of them	Andikwazi ukudlala nayo nayiphi na enye
I could not say the wrong thing	Andikwazanga ukuthetha into engalunganga
Then he got out of the car.	Emva koko wemka emotweni.
Until then, everything is fine.	Kude kube ngoko, yonke into ilungile.
Just so you can do everything.	Ukuze nje ukwazi ukwenza yonke into.
This is not the case, however, it is not.	Oku akunjalo, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
Just right, right, right.	Ilungile nje, ilungile, ilungile.
I just want to see where they live	Ndifuna nje ukubona apho bahlala khona
That is why he went back home.	Yiyo le nto wabuyela ekhaya.
I did that for you	Ndenze oko kuwe
Or I don’t care too much.	Okanye andikhathali kakhulu.
You have never been before.	Awuzange ube ngaphambili.
That, of course, takes a very long time.	Oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
I can't wait to read more.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda ngakumbi.
Then do it again.	Uze wenze kwakhona.
He said something else.	Wathetha enye into.
There is more to come.	Kukho enye into ezayo.
That will be something new.	Oko kuya kuba yinto entsha.
Mary came first.	UMariya weza kuqala.
He will begin.	Uya kuqala.
So this is exactly the same thing.	Ngoko le yinto enye ngokupheleleyo.
I did not know that this was going to happen	Ndandingazi ukuba iya kufika le nto
I know the truth is not everyone.	Ndiyazi ukuba inyani ayinguye wonke umntu.
Not because you want to be successful.	Akunjalo kuba ufuna ukuphumelela ngakumbi.
I think he lived here	Ndicinga ukuba wayehlala apha
I did the same thing	Ndenza into efanayo
Not for me and not for you.	Hayi ngenxa yam kwaye hayi ngawe.
And you made it hard.	Kwaye wenze nzima.
But that to me.	Kodwa oko kum.
And then.	Kwaye emva koko .
I watch my music.	Ndijonge umculo wam.
It really is not possible.	Ngokwenene akunakwenzeka.
This certainly should not be the case.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo akufanele kube njalo.
I want to be better	Ndifuna ukuba ngcono
But he seemed absent.	Kodwa wayebonakala engekho.
He has taken his time.	Uye wathatha ixesha lakhe.
I'm talking about what we did last night	Ndithetha ngale nto siyenze phezolo
He will make it happen.	Uya kukwenza ukuba kwenzeke.
I'm not sure what the big problem is	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki enkulu
I did not know anyone in the area.	Ndandingazi mntu kuloo ndawo.
But others say so.	Kodwa abanye bathi naye.
Not one car, but two.	Hayi imoto enye, kodwa ezimbini.
There was no need to stay.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuhlala.
I knew this was going to happen	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka
Because he cannot read.	Kuba akakwazi ukufunda.
And this will be the case.	Ke oku kuya kuba njalo.
I know nothing about this.	Andazi nto ngale nto.
I can make it happen	Ndingayenza yenzeke
We should both have known that.	Sobabini bekufanele ukuba siyazi loo nto.
I want to talk to you again soon	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe kwakhona kungekudala
You just said you did well.	Uthe nje wenze kakuhle.
No one said it would be easy.	Akukho mntu uthe kuya kuba lula.
So it is not.	Ngoko ke akunjalo.
I have never really been alone	Andizange ndihlale ndedwa ngokwenene
I want to get out of here	Ndifuna ukuphuma apha
I need to talk to her right away	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoko nangoko
There is and it is difficult.	Kukho kwaye kunzima.
Look now !.	Jonga ngoku!.
Now we have to move on.	Ngoku kufuneka siye phambili.
Everything two now.	Yonke into ezimbini ngoku.
I do this alone.	Ndiyenza ndedwa le nto.
Your problem.	Ingxaki yakho.
Or he did, once.	Okanye wenza, kanye.
I can't think of that now	Andikwazi ukucinga ngaloo nto ngoku
I thought this was obvious.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku kucacile.
Obviously three weeks.	Ngokucacileyo iiveki ezintathu.
I have to look up to talk to him	Kufuneka ndijonge phezulu ukuze ndithethe naye
I never thought about it before now	Khange ndicinge ngayo ngaphambili ngoku
You will be a player.	Uza kuba ngumdlali.
He did not tell her anything bad.	Akazange amxelele ngento embi.
After you have done it.	Emva kokuba uyenzile.
And we should not go too far.	Kwaye akufanele sihambe kakhulu.
But it happened again.	Kodwa kwenzeka kwakhona.
Then he really wanted me to leave.	Emva koko wayefuna ngokwenene ukuba ndihambe.
Not just a little bit.	Hayi nje kancinci.
And there are no others.	Kwaye akukho abanye.
I wanted to be human	Ndandifuna ukuba ngumntu
I never thought of anything or anyone	Andizange ndicinge nantoni na okanye nabani na
He asked.	Wabuza.
I know all about you	Ndiyazi yonke indawo yakho
You're always right.	Uhlale ulungile.
I tried to talk to her	Ndazama ukuthetha naye
I'll have to hear from it	Kuya kufuneka ndive kuyo
I saw.	Ndabona.
I can't tell you what's going to happen	Andikwazi ukukuxelela into eza kwenzeka
I'm glad to read this.	Ndiyavuya ukufunda oku.
I can't say that, though	Andikwazi ukuthetha loo nto, nangona kunjalo
There is no reason for us to be there.	Akukho sizathu sokuba sibe lapho.
If she wanted to be a kid, that's fine.	Ukuba wayefuna ukuba ngumntwana, kulungile.
Right here.	Kanye apha.
He gave me a way.	Wandinika indlela.
You would do well to learn about him before you leave.	Uya kuba wenza kakuhle ukufunda ngaye ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
I had to see what was going on	Kwafuneka ndibone ukuba kwenzeka ntoni
Way over you.	Indlela ngaphezu kwakho.
That will do.	Oko kuya kwenza.
You have to be in this.	Kufuneka ube kule.
I think you feel out of place.	Ndicinga ukuba uziva engekho ndawo.
And certainly not.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akukho.
Every day.	Yonke imihla.
I had to do it there	Kwafuneka ndiyenze apho
We want you to do your job.	Sifuna wenze umsebenzi wakho.
You will not be able to walk in it.	Awuyi kukwazi ukuhamba kuyo.
I want something better	Ndifuna into engcono
He got one.	Wafumana enye.
I knew it was impossible	Ndandisazi ukuba akunakwenzeka
He will stay with us.	Uya kuhlala nathi.
It should be quite simple.	Kumele kube lula ngokupheleleyo.
I think he will do very well.	Ndicinga ukuba uza kwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
There is no one outside.	Akukho namnye umntu ngaphandle.
Getting to know the people up here.	Ukwazi abantu apha phezulu.
I'm not very much.	Andikho kakhulu.
You are afraid to do something else.	Uyoyika ukwenza enye into.
But he did not show up.	Kodwa akazange abonakale.
I think this is it	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo le
I should not have told anyone.	Bekufanele ukuba khange ndixelele mntu.
I just wanted to know.	Bendifuna nje ukwazi.
My mother picked up the phone.	Umama wathatha ifowuni.
And we will.	Kwaye siya kwenza njalo.
I can't wait to get home later	Andikwazi kulinda ukuba ndifike ekhaya kamva
But he knew a better way.	Kodwa wayesazi enye indlela engcono.
I'm trying to work on that.	Ndizama ukusebenza kuloo nto.
No, not immediately but soon.	Hayi, hayi ngoko nangoko kodwa kungekudala.
The door is there though	Ucango apho kodwa
That's his place.	Nantso indawo yakhe.
He wanted her to do well.	Wayefuna ukuba enze kakuhle.
I didn't know how to do it alone	Bendingazi ukuba ndingayenza njani lento ndedwa
That is very true.	Yinyani leyo kakhulu.
I don't know what's in it	Andazi ukuba kukho ntoni na kuyo
I knew someone was going to say that	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho umntu oza kuthetha loo nto
You feel it again.	Uziva kwakhona.
I went to work.	Ndaya emsebenzini.
I think you have a problem	Ndicinga ukuba unengxaki
That's what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo.
I had no idea where he was and what had happened	Bendingayazi noba uphi kwaye kwenzeke ntoni
I can't tell you what you want	Andikwazi ukuxelela ukuba ufuna ntoni
If you want someone to come to you you need to come here.	Xa ufuna umntu oza kuye ufuna ukuza apha.
I thought it was okay	Ndandicinga ukuba kulungile
I wanted to be there eventually.	Ndandifuna ukuba khona ekugqibeleni.
I didn’t want him to try to drive	Bendingafuni azame ukuqhuba
But, it's only one thing.	Kodwa, yinto enye kuphela.
Now, that's right.	Ngoku, kunjalo.
I want you to spend time with me	Ndifuna uchitha ixesha nam
Too little performance in the end.	Ukusebenza kancinci kakhulu ekugqibeleni.
I would like to know the truth	Ndingathanda ukwazi inyaniso
Really like you, too.	Ngokwenene njengawe, nawe.
But it could be me.	Kodwa inokuba ndim lo.
Not now, not here.	Hayi ngoku, hayi apha.
But now he is asleep.	Kodwa ngoku ulele.
I have to tell you about it	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ngayo
Soon, yes.	Kungekudala, ewe.
I was nothing	Andizange ndibe nto
I did not want to be late	Bendingafuni ukuba late
Going inside.	Ukuya ngaphakathi.
No no how.	Hayi hayi njani.
He has become a friend and that is all.	Uye waba ngumhlobo kwaye kuphela oko.
I will do a lot of things at the top.	Ndiza kwenza izinto ezininzi phezulu.
I know what you did	Ndiyazi ukuba wenze ntoni
I know this will not be easy	Ndiyazi ukuba oku akuyi kuba lula
We need help and urgently.	Sifuna uncedo kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
Long time, wait.	Ixesha elide, ukulinda.
I hope not	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo
I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time	Kudala ndijonge ukudibana nawe
I made a mistake	Ndenza impazamo
I am very skeptical.	Ndiyathandabuza kakhulu.
I thought it would succeed	Ndandicinga ukuba iza kuphumelela
So it comes to you.	Ngoko iza kuwe.
I know how hard this is	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani oku
I knew this was not going to be good	Ndandisazi ukuba oku akuyi kuba kuhle
I should not have told him	Bekungafanelanga ndimxelele
Few things, though.	Izinto ezimbalwa, nangona kunjalo.
I thought that was all.	Ndandicinga ukuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
I'll be down soon.	Ndiza kuba phantsi kungekudala.
Your mother did.	Umama wakho wenza njalo.
Is your place.	Ngaba indawo yakho.
I certainly hope so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akufanele.
I just wanted to stay here for a bit	Bendifuna nje ukuhlala apha kancinci
Nobody does that today.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto namhlanje.
You know you did.	Uyazi ukuba wenze njalo.
I wanted you to go with me	Bendifuna uhamba nam
I know just like you.	Ndiyazi nje njengawe.
What a week.	Yintoni iveki.
And you are good at it.	Kwaye ulungile kuyo.
But you have to tell me.	Kodwa kufuneka undixelele.
I think it is even more possible	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka ngakumbi
I knew something was going on	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo
I'm thinking of buying that.	Ndicinga ukuthenga loo nto.
I did not stay in it	Khange ndihlale kuyo
I'm scared of things, a lot of things	Ndiyoyika izinto, izinto ezininzi
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo.
You can't sit still for long.	Awukwazi ukuhlala phantsi ixesha elide.
Not my age.	Hayi iminyaka yam.
I know where this is	Ndiyayazi ukuba iphi le
That's what you always think.	Yiloo nto uhlala ucinga ngayo.
I thought that was strange	Bendicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo
Well done really well.	Yenziwe kakuhle ngenene.
He is very scared without me.	Woyika kakhulu ngaphandle kwam.
I don’t know how hard it is to do this	Andazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani na ukwenza oku
I could not do this alone.	Andikwazanga ukwenza oku ndedwa.
That's what he's really talking about.	Yiloo nto ethetha ngayo ngenene.
That person.	Ukuba umntu.
And her children too.	Kwaye nabantwana bakhe.
And that to me is very good.	Kwaye oko kum kuhle kakhulu.
Only many questions.	Kuphela imibuzo emininzi.
Waiting on it.	Ukulinda kuyo.
A little bit, maybe.	Kancinci kancinci, mhlawumbi.
You have waited too long for this.	Ulinde ixesha elide kakhulu kule nto.
You said that was a big job.	Ubuthe ngumsebenzi omkhulu lowo.
I can't tell him the truth	Andikwazi kumxelela inyani
I don't think they'll go far enough.	Andiqondi ukuba baya kude ngokwaneleyo.
He did not speak to her.	Khange athethe naye.
I'm not sure how long it will take	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iza kuthatha ixesha elingakanani
I can't wait to try everything !.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuzama yonke into!.
There was no one in front of him	Kwakungekho mntu phambi kwakhe
Here, in the room.	Apha, egumbini.
That's what's happening now.	Nantso into eyenzekayo ngoku.
I hope you like it too	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uyayithanda
Sorry, but you are human.	Uxolo, kodwa ungumntu.
I want to be with you in this.	Ndifuna ukuba nawe kule nto.
Going to tell everyone.	Ukuhamba ukuxelela wonke umntu.
I need you here at the hospital	Ndifuna wena apha esibhedlele
And yet, he never told me.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akazange andixelele.
Or it seemed then back then.	Okanye kwakubonakala ngoko emva.
I hope to meet you again soon.	Ndiyathemba ukudibana nawe kwakhona ngaphambi kwexesha elide.
Everywhere, to do anything.	Kuyo yonke indawo, ukwenza nantoni na.
We will come back later.	Siza kubuya emva koko.
I did this the other way	Ndenze le ngenye indlela
I want to know if that is true	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba yinyani na leyo
I never said that.	Khange ndithethe ngolo hlobo.
I couldn't help it after all	Zange ndikwazi ukuzibamba emva koko
I don't have time to do anything	Andinaxesha lokwenza nantoni na
I will definitely have to have it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kufuneka ndibe nayo.
Then he did something else.	Emva koko wenza enye into.
That would be something, of course.	Oko kuya kuba yinto, kunjalo.
And yet, there is really only one.	Kwaye kunjalo, kukho ngokwenene enye kuphela.
There you have it	Nantso ke unayo
I've certainly thought about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiye ndacinga ngayo.
Peace out.	Uxolo ngaphandle.
I want to help you do that.	Ndifuna ukukunceda wenze loo nto.
I'm not sure what he wanted.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wayefuna ntoni.
The music is moving very fast.	Umculo uhamba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
We know you have it.	Siyazi ukuba unayo.
I wanted to succeed	Ndandifuna ukuphumelela
I could not take a chance	Andikwazanga ukuthatha ithuba
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu.
Probably, this time.	Mhlawumbi, ngeli xesha.
Not that it will be easy.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kuba lula.
I just want to do it.	Ndifuna nje ukuyenza.
I wanted to see what was going on	Bendifuna ukubona ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
He just can't work.	Akakwazi nje ukusebenza.
Taking her son.	Ukuthatha unyana wakhe.
I could no longer control myself	Zange ndiphinde ndikwazi ukuzibamba
Until I go.	Kude ndihambe.
I have to look at others now	Kufuneka ndijonge abanye ngoku
My mother knew about it.	Umama wayesazi ngayo.
We will stay there from now on.	Siza kuhlala apho ukusukela ngoku ukuya phambili.
I wonder if she is okay.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ulungile na.
I just wanted to know how you feel about me	Bendifuna nje ukwazi ukuba uziva njani ngam
I'm not in that situation	Andikho kuloo meko
Anything less complicated.	Nantoni na engekho nzima kakhulu.
I can't walk fast	Andikwazi kuhamba ngokukhawuleza
I can't wait	Andikwazi ukuhlala ndilinde
I do not know tomorrow	Andikwazi ngomso
I never did that	Andizange ndiyenze kanye loo nto
I can't take your money	Andikwazi ukuthatha imali yakho
It's a long time though, it probably isn't.	Lixesha elide kodwa, inokuba ayinguye.
I knew he was going to leave soon	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuhamba kungekudala
He goes with me.	Uhamba nam.
I'm afraid he did something bad to you.	Ndiyoyika ukuba wenze into embi kuwe.
And we will continue.	Kwaye siya kuqhubeka.
It happens very, very often.	Kwenzeka kakhulu kakhulu.
He did it again.	Wayenza kwakhona.
I really live here	Ndihlala apha nyani
I needed time alone.	Ndandifuna ixesha lokuba ndedwa.
Sorry, very sorry	Uxolo, uxolo kakhulu
I'll come with you soon	Ndiza kuza nawe kungekudala
I say yes, but it is not	Ndithetha ewe, kodwa akunjalo

I have to go, to be with him	Kufuneka ndihambe, ukuze ndibe naye
I do that very well too	Ndiyenza kakuhle kakhulu loo nto nam
Except it certainly wasn't.	Ngaphandle ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungekho.
But, in the end, there was nothing else to do.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, kwakungekho enye into yokwenza.
Read more every day.	Ukufunda ngakumbi yonke imihla.
We will do everything together.	Siya kwenza yonke into kunye.
Now, just look at yourself.	Ngoku, jonga nje kuwe.
But not here, not in this place.	Kodwa hayi apha, hayi kule ndawo.
I will know why.	Ndiya kukwazi ukuba kutheni.
I don't have to look back	Akufunekanga ndijonge ngasemva
Everyone knows this.	Wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
I wonder how you feel	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uziva njani
I want you to tell her.	Ndifuna umxelele.
I know you do too	Ndiyazi nawe wenza njalo
I decided that today	Ndagqiba ukuba namhlanje
We need to do our best at home.	Kufuneka senze umsebenzi ongcono kakhulu ekhaya.
Me at home.	Mna ekhaya.
You will probably want to get a dog.	Mhlawumbi uya kufuna ukufumana inja.
We will find out.	Siza kufumana.
Maybe it will go away.	Mhlawumbi iya kuhamba.
I can't think of that	Andikwazi ukucinga ngaloo nto
He will do it once.	Uya kwenza kanye.
Little did I know that it would be painful.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuya kuba buhlungu.
I suspect he is not there	Ndiyarhana ukuba akakho
I'm afraid how long this will last	Ndiyoyika ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani le nto
I don't care what it is.	Andikhathali nokuba yintoni na.
Everyone wants to go.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuhamba.
I'm not going there	andiyi apho
I thought that was good enough	Ndacinga ukuba oko kulungile ngokwaneleyo
I can't pick up your phone	Andikwazi ukuthatha umnxeba wakho
So let's.	Ngoko makhe.
The police have arrived here.	Amapolisa afike apha.
And he wanted to stay the night.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuhlala ubusuku.
Will you wait.	Ngaba uya kulinda.
I can't be just a friend to him	Andikwazi ukuba ngumhlobo nje kuye
He looked at his mother.	Wajonga umama wakhe.
I told him the truth last night	Ndimxelele inyani phezolo
We will talk to you about this.	Siza kuthetha nawe ngale nto.
He would not stay.	Wayengayi kuhlala.
He looked out.	Wajonga phandle.
And some people will buy from it.	Kwaye abanye abantu baya kuthenga kuyo.
And there is someone else in the background.	Kwaye kukho omnye umntu ngasemva.
Nothing more than that.	Akukho ngaphezu koko.
I don't want to do this without you	Andifuni kuyenza le nto ngaphandle kwakho
Because it is possible.	Kuba kunokwenzeka.
If this is not the case, then it will probably happen.	Ukuba oku akunjalo, ngaphandle kuya kwenzeka.
But they did not.	Kodwa abazange.
I knew that was going to happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
And the wait is too long	Kwaye ukulinda ixesha elide kakhulu
This one did not.	Lo akenzanga.
I want to find a way	Ndifuna ukufumana indlela
I think death will be so	Ndicinga ukuba ukufa kuya kuba njalo
I think everyone does.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu wenza njalo.
I think you don't want to	Ndicinga ukuba awufuni
I can't work well	Andikwazi ukusebenza kakuhle
Or anytime, for that matter.	Okanye nanini na, ngaloo nto.
I never had a ball	Andizange ndibe nayo ibhola
I will continue to do that.	Ndiza kuqhubeka ukwenza oko.
I wanted to find an answer to that.	Ndandifuna ukufumana impendulo kuloo nto.
I wonder if you already know that	Ndiyazibuza ukuba sele uyayazi na loo nto
I only hope for him no	Ndiyathemba kuphela ngenxa yakhe akukho

I just think of you	Ndicinga nje nawe

I never thought of any other way	Andizange ndicinge ngenye indlela
I couldn’t do it now, though	Andikwazanga ukuyenza ngoku, nangona kunjalo
He’s just like us, but he works a little bit slower.	Ufana nje nathi, kodwa usebenza kancinci kancinci.
And you know that.	Kwaye uyayazi loo nto.
It will end badly.	Kuya kuphela kakubi.
And I couldn't help it.	Kwaye andikwazanga ukunceda.
Almost immediately for three years.	Phantse ngokukhawuleza iminyaka emithathu.
I think you should be	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube njalo
I mean to know someone really	Ndithetha ukwazi umntu ngokwenene
You really want to be real.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukuba yinyani.
It doesn't have to be.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba.
I didn't see much of it after that	Andizange ndibone nto ingako emva koko
He walks slowly.	Uhamba kancinci.
I'll be back tonight	Ndiza kubuya ngoku ngokuhlwa
I'll have to look at some of his friends	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge abanye abahlobo bakhe
I think you did a good job here	Ndicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle apha
Will it be his turn next week?!?!.	Ingaba kwiveki ezayo ingaba lixesha lakhe?!?!.
He says he never did.	Uthi akazange ayenze.
Is it.	Ngaba yiyo.
I can't believe you feel this way about me.	Andikholelwa ukuba uziva ngolu hlobo ngam.
I'll find another place	Ndiza kufumana enye indawo
I didn't see him anywhere	Khange ndimbone ndawo
I knew he would do it	Ndandisazi ukuba iya kuyenza loo nto
Gaining intelligence.	Ukufumana ingqondo.
I have learned from him more than anyone else	Ndifunde kuye ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na
There is something wrong with her.	Kukho into engalunganga kuye.
But music does.	Kodwa umculo uyayenza.
Maybe he should tell someone what happened.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka axelele umntu ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Lunch and work.	Isidlo sasemini kunye emsebenzini.
So, as it were.	Ngoko, njengokuba kunjalo.
I'll talk about him again, later	Ndiza kuthetha ngaye kwakhona, kamva
It will be difficult to find one.	Kuya kuba nzima ukufumana enye.
He just took it.	Wathatha nje.
Even this is not necessary.	Nokuba oku akufuneki.
I think there is something to this.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into kule nto.
We will come back again and again.	Siza kubuya kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I came to a strange place	Ndifike kwindawo engaqhelekanga
I know he doesn't like living there	Ndiyamazi ukuba akakuthandi ukuhlala apho
For a very long time indeed.	Ixesha elide kakhulu ngokwenene.
We'll get to that later.	Siza kufika kuloo nto kamva.
I don't know if that's true or not	Andazi noba yinyani leyo okanye hayi
When you appear.	Xa ubonakala.
It should also be fun and swimming is the same.	Kufuneka kwakhona kube mnandi kwaye ukuqubha kunjalo.
He had to stay in bed.	Bekufanele ahlale ebhedini.
I knew it was going to happen	Ndandisazi ukuba iza kwenzeka loo nto
He realized what it was.	Waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
We want to do this.	Sifuna ukuyenza le nto.
This did not really happen.	Oku akuzange kube njalo ngokwenene.
One big question.	Umbuzo omnye omkhulu.
My father came more than anyone.	Utata ufike ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
I do not have to be very tall	Akufunekanga ndibe mde kakhulu
He is good and does his best.	Ulungile kwaye wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I hope you can do it	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza
What will this mean.	Kuya kuthetha ntoni oku.

I thought it would be even harder	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi

I had to tell him more	Kwafuneka ndimxelele ngakumbi
I did the right thing	Ndenze into elungileyo
There was nothing at all in it	Kwakungekho nto kwaphela kuyo
That's exactly right now.	Kunjalo kanye ngoku.
Really, really hard.	Ngokwenene, kunzima ngokwenene.
I could not keep waiting	Khange ndikwazi ukuhlala ndilinde
This can happen very quickly.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Otherwise, it will be difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, kuya kuba nzima.
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into.
Now it will be a thing !.	Ngoku iya kuba yinto!.
I want to know how this happened	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku
Well, maybe this won't be too difficult.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi oku akuyi kuba nzima kakhulu.
Absolutely beautiful.	Mhle ngokupheleleyo.
Or do you think you did that?	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenze njalo.
I would like to achieve this	Ndingathanda ukuphumelela oku
But it will be the same.	Kodwa iya kuba yinto efanayo.
Very few days	Iintsuku ezimbalwa kakhulu
I don't know which one to come first.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi eza kuqala.
If you really don't want to.	Ukuba ngokwenene awufuni.
Like, it's too far.	Njengokuba, kude kakhulu.

He was thinking about her.	Wayecinga ngaye.
Someone else did that.	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto .
I will always be here.	Ndiya kuhlala ndilapha.
In the city.	Edolophini.
How good is that ?.	Kuhle kangakanani oko?.
Truth shall speak;	Inyaniso iya kuthetha;
When you think about it.	Xa ucinga ngayo.
Lots of kids, lots of people.	Abantwana abaninzi, abantu abaninzi.
I need to learn more about her	Kufuneka ndifunde ngakumbi ngaye
I knew nothing but you	Bendingazi nto ngaphandle kwakho
And it's easy for you.	Kwaye kube lula kuwe.
I moved forward quickly	Ndaya phambili ngokukhawuleza
He never wanted to see her again.	Akazange afune ukubona kwakhona.
He's just like me.	Ufana nam nje.
I have to be with him	Kufuneka ndibe naye
I thought it was just a thing	Bendicinga ukuba yinto nje
I can certainly do that	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingayenza loo nto

Again, this is not possible.	Kwakhona, oku akunakwenzeka.
I just wanted to get it	Bendifuna nje ukufumana
Clearly, something is wrong.	Kucacile ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
I never thought he would do that	Andizange ndicinge ukuba angayenza loo nto
That's right, really, that's right now.	Kunjalo, ngokwenene, kunjalo okwangoku.
I have to learn to swim	Ndifanele ndifunde ukuqubha
You will not have to do anything.	Akuyi kufuneka wenze nantoni na.
I can't say who he is.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba ngubani.
I think he wanted to have a party too	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna ukwenza itheko kakhulu
I want to do it to make friends	Ndifuna ukuyenza ukuze ndenze abahlobo

I didn't know that about you	Bendingayazi lonto ngawe
You are expecting a better person.	Ulindele umntu ongcono.
Everywhere there is something.	Kuyo yonke indawo kukho into.
He didn't think it was right.	Akazange acinge ukuba kulungile.
I just want to be with you	Ndifuna nje ukuba nam
And certainly not the people.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi abantu.
No, really.	Akunjalo, ngokwenene.

I want to see a doctor	Ndifuna ukubona ugqirha
He said he was talking to her.	Uye wathi uthetha naye.

And everything else.	Kwaye yonke enye into.
Maybe I never did that	Mhlawumbi andizange ndiyenze loo nto
We did everything.	Senze yonke into.
I thought you did a really good job.	Bendicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
He does not know what is right or wrong.	Akayazi into elungileyo okanye embi.
But then he died.	Kodwa ke wafa.
I can make sense of you not being able to	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza ingqondo yokuba awukwazi

I could not speak	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha
There and then.	Apho kwaye ngoko.
I want an answer as to what is wrong with it	Ndifuna impendulo ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngayo
He just wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna ukuba kunye naye kuphela.
I did it just once.	Ndiyenze kanye nje.
I look forward to meeting you soon!	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana nawe kungekudala!
He tried to think.	Wazama ukucinga.
And wait.	Kwaye ukulinda.
And there seems to be another big one.	Kwaye kubonakala kukho enye enkulu.
Because now she knew he loved her.	Kuba ngoku wayesazi ukuba uyamthanda.
I don't remember much either	Nam andikhumbuli kakhulu
Just children.	Abantwana nje.
Only he was not there.	Kuphela wayengekho.
I learned a few things	Ndifunde izinto ezimbalwa
I've never heard of this before.	Andizange ndive ngale nto ngaphambili.
I will be me	Ndiya kuba ndim

There he built a big house.	Apho wakha indlu enkulu.
I didn't look for anything else	Khange ndijonge enye into
I have never seen this person before	Andizange ndimbone lo mntu ngaphambili
You love your mom so much, you want to be her.	Uthanda umama wakho kakhulu, ufuna ukuba nguye.
I wonder why that is so	Ndiyazibuza ke ukuba kutheni kunjalo
I never thought of it, of course	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo, kunjalo
Then he pulled out a letter.	Emva koko wakhupha ileta.
Something is really wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga ngokwenene.
There is not much about him.	Akukho nto ingako ngaye.
Really, just a little bit.	Ngokwenene, kancinci nje.
Everything is clear in front of me now.	Konke kucacile phambi kwam ngoku.
Eventually they will.	Ekugqibeleni baya kwenza njalo.
There is only up or down	Kukho kuphela phezulu okanye phantsi
This, however, did not happen.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akuzange kwenzeke.
The truth is, he did not know for sure.	Inyaniso kukuba, wayengazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
And soon, there is.	Kwaye kungekudala, kukho.

You know you can do it.	Uyazi ukuba ungayenza.
I thought about it for years though	Ndandicinga ngayo iminyaka nangona

I did not know much about him	Ndandingazi nto ingako ngaye
I think you mean me	Ndicinga ukuba uthetha mna
I didn't look at what it was	Khange ndijonge ukuba yintoni na
I wanted to go to him, now, now	Bendifuna ukuya kuye, ngoku, ngoku
He loves money.	Uthanda imali.
But it is a child.	Kodwa ngumntwana.
Life in prison after that	Ubomi bonke entolongweni emva koko
But he says he will not come.	Kodwa uthi akayi kuza.
Hope.	Lithemba.
Now you are talking to yourself.	Ngoku uthetha wedwa.
I told her all about you	Ndamxelela konke ngawe
Now, he knew why.	Ngoku, wayesazi ukuba kutheni.

So there are other things.	Ngoko kukho ezinye izinto.
I am as tired as you are now	Nam ndidiniwe ngoku njengawe
She goes to work every day.	Uya emsebenzini yonke imihla.
It seems like it could be.	Kubonakala ngathi kunokuba njalo.
I don't believe he can do that to me	Andikholelwa ukuba angayenza loo nto kum
Now it really is.	Ngoku kunjalo ngokwenene.

This is it, you think.	Yiyo le, ucinga.
I doubt this is true	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba yinyani le

Hope to play better tomorrow	Ndiyathemba ukudlala ngcono ngomso
Otherwise, there is no place.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho ndawo.
He did not tell me.	Khange andixelele.
I wanted to tell you then	Bendifuna ukukuxelela ke
Nobody did that again.	Akukho mntu wayenza loo nto kwakhona.
I have to have it before	Ndifanele ndibe nayo ngaphambili
Certainly, you are right.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ulungile.
I wanted more time	Ndandifuna ixesha elingakumbi
I can learn to swim	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda ukuqubha
That's what he did.	Yinto ayenzileyo.
I'm not sure how you can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ungayenza njani loo nto.

Do you and him.	Ngaba wena kunye naye.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa ke akazange afune.
I'm not in it.	Andikho kuyo.
I never did well in school	Andizange ndibe kakhulu esikolweni
I really wanted to be with you	Bendifuna kakhulu ukuba nawe
I hope they succeed soon	Ndiyathemba ukuba baza kuphumelela kungekudala
I didn't want to see what happened next.	Ndandingafuni ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Finally he looked up.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga phezulu.
Marriage is this.	Umtshato oku.
Most days will be like this in the morning.	Imihla emininzi iya kuba njalo kusasa.
So the woman was not there.	Ngoko umfazi wayengekho.
If there is one.	Ukuba kukho enye.
I thought it was really good	Ndacinga ukuba ilungile ngokwenene
I will do many things	Ndiza kwenza izinto ezininzi
There is clearly something to this.	Kukho into ngokucacileyo kule nto.
I could do that a little bit, but not too much.	Ndingayenza loo nto kancinci, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Come with him.	Uze naye.
But yes, it is not only possible, it is done.	Kodwa ewe, akunakwenzeka kuphela, yenziwe.
If he can get better, that's fine for him.	Ukuba unokuba ngcono, kulungile kuye.
I thought this was strange	Bendicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga le
I think I can do it this time	Ndicinga ukuba ndingayenza ngeli xesha
Someone is doing better.	Omnye umntu wenza ngcono.
Right here.	Apha.
I can't help you, now, but much later	Andikwazi ukukunceda, ngoku, kodwa kamva kakhulu
He is already here.	Sele elapha.
I will talk a lot	Ndiza kuthetha kakhulu
In the end, nothing will happen to you.	Ekugqibeleni, akukho nto iya kwenzeka kuwe.
I want to see what you think	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba ucinga ntoni
I could not wait for the food	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukutya
He got out of his car and opened the letter.	Waphuma waya emotweni yakhe wavula ileta.
She is not. 	Akakho. 
And in this case, too, to travel here.	Kwaye kule meko, kwakhona, ukuhamba apha.
Here we will do what we need to do.	Apha siya kwenza into ekufuneka siyenze.
Eventually I had to look up	Ekugqibeleni kwafuneka ndijonge phezulu
He wanted to get home.	Wayefuna ukufika ekhaya.
Even if he did not.	Nokuba akazange.
What he knew now.	Oko wayesazi ngoku.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto yinto.
But that did not happen	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke
We did it in the beginning, but not later.	Senze ekuqaleni, kodwa hayi emva.
No, he told her.	Akunjalo, wamxelela.
I'm sure he has never been there before	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akazange abe khona ngaphambili
I knew it could be just one thing.	Ndandisazi ukuba inokuba yinto enye kuphela.
I wanted to talk a lot with him.	Bendifuna ukuthetha kakhulu naye.
I did not hear anything.	Andizange ndive nto tu.
I did the same with him.	Ndenza njalo naye.
Would he never come, he thought.	Ngaba akanakuze eze, wacinga njalo.
I should not have done that.	Bekungafanelanga ndiyenze lonto.
I can't come now	Andikwazi ukuza ngoku
We will do that for years.	Siza kuyenza loo nto iminyaka.
That should not be too difficult.	Oko akufanele kube nzima.
I couldn’t take too much of that	Andikwazanga ukuthatha kakhulu kuloo nto
Slowly but surely.	Kancinci kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
Just in time.	Kuphela nje ngexesha.
He returned to her.	Wabuyela kuye.
Nothing will happen to him.	Akukho nto iza kwenzeka kuye.
I'm not there yet.	Andikho apho okwangoku.
It is very good to stay.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuhlala.
Maybe you're right about that.	Mhlawumbi ulungile ngaloo nto.
He just sat there.	Wahlala nje.
Thanks, maybe.	Enkosi, mhlawumbi.
I had to think back long and hard	Kwafuneka ndicinge emva ixesha elide kwaye nzima
Or a few days.	Okanye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
He told me a lot last night.	Undixelele okuninzi phezolo.
And maybe you are.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ukhona.
I will do something great later	Ndiza kwenza into enkulu kamva
He just didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi nje ukuba angayenza njani loo nto.
The question will be what happens to everyone.	Umbuzo uya kuba yintoni eyenzekayo kuye wonke umntu.
He wants to but.	Uyafuna kodwa.
Almost too, of course.	Phantse kakhulu, kunjalo.
I never thought he should go there	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kufuneka aye apho
You didn't, because you can't.	Awuzange, kuba awukwazi.
I'm afraid his response.	Ndiyoyika impendulo yakhe.
I couldn’t do this without you and I don’t want to	Andikwazanga ukwenza oku ngaphandle kwakho kwaye andifuni
Now you want one.	Ngoku ufuna enye.
He told her the truth.	Wamxelela inyani.
I never saw him again	Khange ndiphinde ndimbone
Not in the bedroom.	Hayi kwigumbi lokulala.
I know what's in there	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni na apho
If not for him, then for me.	Ukuba akunjalo ngenxa yakhe, ke ngenxa yam.
Very little.	Kancinci kakhulu.
Thank you for a wonderful time.	Enkosi ngexesha elihle kakhulu.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
And hours.	Kwaye iiyure.
I tried to get away from him	Ndazama kude kuye
Finally he came back to me.	Ekugqibeleni wabuyela kum.
I never went to school again	Andizange ndiphinde ndiye esikolweni
I didn’t tell her that, though	Andizange ndimxelele loo nto, nangona kunjalo
The big problem here.	Ingxaki enkulu apha.
He never regretted it.	Akazange abe buhlungu ngaloo nto.
And so it really is, it seems out of place.	Kwaye kunjalo ngenene, kubonakala ngaphandle.
I have to go with everything now	Kufuneka ndihambe nayo yonke into ngoku
In the end, you did the right thing.	Ekugqibeleni, wenze into entle.
I will do so.	Ndiya kwenza njalo.
You just have to look.	Kufuneka ujonge nje.
I am very happy about this though	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ngale nto nangona
In time it is possible.	Ngexesha kunokwenzeka.
More is not required.	Okuninzi akufuneki.
I can't take much	Andikwazi ukuthatha okuninzi
I can't wait for that time	Andikwazi kulinda elo xesha
I come here to read.	Ndiza apha ukuze ndifunde.
Too much talking.	Ukuthetha kakhulu.
I know everything, everyone, everything is fine.	Ndiyazi yonke into, wonke umntu, konke kulungile.
I could not decide who to talk to	Khange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba ndithethe nabani
But then it happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka.
And that's what happened.	Kwaye yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
I couldn't do anything though	Andikwazanga kwenza nto kodwa
He was also very scared.	Kwakhona wayesoyika kakhulu.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi.
Where he lives.	Apho ahlala khona.
Not this one, he thought.	Hayi kule, wacinga.
I can't say anything about that	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na ngaloo nto
Yeah, look.	Ewe, jonga.
I can't speak right now	Andikwazi kuthetha okwangoku
I haven't done it for years	Andizange ndiyenze iminyaka
What is happening here.	Kwenzeka ntoni apha.
In your time.	Ngexesha lakho.
I didn't know about you	Bendingazi ngawe
I have to do this myself	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngokwam lento
All is well again.	Konke kulungile kwakhona.
I never thought how this would go	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kuhamba njani
You have spoken to him.	Uye wathetha naye.
But his mother.	Kodwa umama wakhe.
There is definitely an error.	Kukho impazamo ngokuqinisekileyo.
It happened at a party.	Kwenzeke epatini.
I never thought he was	Andizange ndicinge ukuba nguye
I did not want her to talk again	Bendingafuni aphinde athethe
Too long, maybe	Ixesha elide kakhulu, mhlawumbi
You have done it before.	Uyenzile ngaphambili.
You have to come forward.	Kufuneka uze ngaphambili.
But now it was nothing.	Kodwa ngoku kwakungekho nto.
I told you what was going to happen.	Ndikuxelele into eza kwenzeka.
I think you know where	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi apho
He didn't know nobody, either.	Wayengazi mntu, naye.
I had to know what was going on	Kwafuneka ndiyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I would like to stay there	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apho
I did not know much about him.	Ndandingazi nto ingako ngaye.
Maybe now, it's time for us to be together.	Mhlawumbi ngoku, lixesha lokuba sibe kunye.
I want to make that money	Ndifuna ukwenza loo mali
Well, one, that's right.	Ewe, enye, kunjalo.
If not long after that.	Ukuba akunjalo ixesha elide emva koko.
Learning must happen.	Ukufunda kufuneka kwenzeke.
I realized there was something wrong with her	Ndabona ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngaye
And down again.	Kwaye phantsi kwakhona.
It seemed like I didn't care.	Kwakubonakala ngathi andikhathali.
It will be really good.	Kuya kuba kuhle ngokwenene.
Not the kids'.	Hayi abantwana'.
Everyone was talking about everything.	Wonke umntu wayethetha ngento yonke.
He did not speak the way he did.	Khange athethe ngendlela athethe ngayo.
I want you to think about that	Ndifuna ucinge ngaloo nto
But everyone knows what happens next.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
I didn't want to think about it yet	Ndandingafuni ukucinga ngaloo nto okwangoku
He will talk to you.	Uya kuthetha nawe.
Better than you think.	Kungcono kunokuba ucinga.
I'd like to do that	Ndingathanda ukuyenza loo nto
I can't imagine how that will happen	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka njani oko
Yes, definitely at night.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo ebusuku.
I could not do anything else.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza enye into.
I could do it without him	Ndingayenza ngaphandle kwakhe
No one has ever done this before.	Akukho mntu wakha wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
So, look.	Ngoko, jonga.
It’s hard to imagine, though.	Kunzima ukucinga, nangona kunjalo.
You know, you look very much like me.	Uyazi, ufana nam kakhulu.
He didn't say anything to me, either.	Akazange athethe nto kum, naye.
She is unable to go to the hospital.	Akakwazi ukuya esibhedlele.
I am alone.	Ndim ndedwa.
I really want to talk to her today	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye namhlanje
I thought you did a good job	Ndandicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle
I apologize for all this.	Ndicela uxolo ngayo yonke lento.
I can't stay with you	Andikwazi ukuhlala nawe
But this is not very necessary for me.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko kakhulu kum.
A good wife	Umfazi olungileyo
We go to work.	Siya emsebenzini.
I don't want to, but what.	Andifuni, kodwa yintoni na.
He can't do this to us, he thought.	Akanakuyenza le nto kuthi, wacinga njalo.
That's the problem for you.	Nantso ingxaki kuwe.
I doubt his man did	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba umntu wakhe wenza njalo
There is nothing in his city for you.	Akukho nto edolophini yakhe kuwe.
You say .	Uthi .
I am convinced that this is the case	Ndiqinisekile ukuba oku kunjalo
I know this about him.	Ndiyayazi lento ngaye.
But tomorrow night.	Kodwa ngomso ebusuku.
We never had it.	Asizange sibe nayo.
I always feel like I'm saying something wrong to you	Ndihlala ngathi ndithetha into engalunganga kuwe
And we will do it.	Kwaye siya kuyenza.
I thought this would be the case.	Ndacinga ukuba oku kuya kuba njalo.
Only then will you be able to really stop.	Kuphela emva koko uya kukwazi ukuyeka ngokwenene.
He never made music again.	Akazange enze umculo kwakhona.
Just a little bit though.	Kancinci nje kodwa.
Yes, you do not.	Ewe, awufuni.
I thought about him all the time	Ndandicinga ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha
You are lying with me here in bed.	Ulele nam apha ebhedini.
He never came out.	Zange waphuma.
I do my homework	Ndenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo
You seem to know a few things.	Ubonakala wazi izinto ezimbalwa.
I would like to buy a car.	Ndingathanda ukuthenga imoto.
Me or mine.	Mna okanye wam.
I have to go to the office.	Kufuneka ndiye eofisini.
I think there is help ahead.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho uncedo ngaphambili.
You are good at that.	Ulungile kuloo nto.
And that is possible.	Kwaye oko kunokwenzeka.
I think that's all	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo yonke into
Nice to see you here.	Ndiyavuya ukubona apha.
He looked at the house.	Wajonga ekhaya.
I have to be somewhere	Kufuneka ndibe kwindawo ethile
What a woman.	Yintoni umfazi.
I feel good.	Ndiziva kakuhle.
Doing the work is hard enough.	Ukwenza umsebenzi kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
See who it is.	Jonga ukuba ngubani na.
I never saw him again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndimbone.
Not so with life.	Akunjalo ubomi.
I know he is talking about me	Ndiyamazi ukuba uthetha ngam
I don't have to do that	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndiyenze loo nto
I never thought it would be without him	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ngaphandle kwakhe
He took everything down.	Wathatha yonke into phantsi.
We'll have time later.	Siza kuba nexesha kamva.
I did not look up.	Khange ndijonge phezulu.
I thought about this for a long time	Ndacinga ngale nto ixesha elide
I always thought that.	Ndihlala ndicinga ukuba.
However, something else happened.	Kodwa ke, kwenzeka enye into.
Two or three weeks, together.	Iiveki ezimbini okanye ezintathu, kunye.
No, no, before.	Hayi, hayi, ngaphambili.
I want to get out of here soon.	Ndifuna ukuphuma apha kungekudala.
This will be easy.	Oku kuya kuba lula.
However, that is not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
Not forward.	Hayi phambili.
I didn't see him much after that.	Andizange ndimbone kakhulu emva koko.
I never heard from him.	Zange ndive kuye.
All of that we now know for sure.	Yonke loo nto ngoku siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
I could do that, you know	Ndingayenza loo nto, uyazi
I'm not sure if that is the case	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kunjalo
You know how he does it.	Uyazi ukuba wenza njani.
I know what's going on there	Ndiyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni phaya
And there is no reason for that.	Kwaye akukho sizathu sokuba kube njalo.
He apologized.	Wathi uxolo naye.
There it is now.	Kukho ngoku.
You do not have to wait for something to happen.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ulinde ukuba kwenzeke into.
Nobody is going to talk to us.	Akukho mntu uza kuthetha nathi.
I did not know how long she would stay.	Ndandingazi ukuba uza kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Yes, you made a big mistake.	Ewe, wenze impazamo enkulu.
It's coming again.	Iza kwakhona.
Someone has to say something.	Umntu kufuneka athethe into.
So it will be very visible.	Ngoko iya kubonakala kakhulu.
We want to know that, though.	Sifuna ukwazi oko, nangona kunjalo.
But for me, no more.	Kodwa kum, hayi ngakumbi.
I'm just not there.	Andikho nje.
He is very human.	Ngumntu kakhulu.
I want to do it	Ndifuna ukuyenza
One more word.	Elinye igama elingakumbi.
Nothing happened, so he tried again.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo, ngoko wazama kwakhona.
He lived well here.	Wahlala kakuhle apha.
I've been trying to do that for a long time	Kudala ndizama ukwenza njalo
I was thinking about you	Bendicinga ngawe
You know that it will always be so.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
She sat back.	Wahlala emva.
We know a little about it.	Siyazi kancinci ngayo.
I hope you enjoy your stay	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda indawo yakho yokuhlala
He too wanted to go to town.	Naye wayefuna ukuya edolophini.
I did not want to know.	Bendingafuni ukwazi.
I can't say exactly what it is	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni kanye kanye
I doubt it, though.	Ndiyathandabuza, nangona kunjalo.
I would like to know	Ndingathanda ukwazi
I think for now you should stay with us	Ndicinga ukuba okwangoku kufuneka uhlale nathi
I hope you have understood	Ndiyathemba ukuba uye waqonda
I'm not in it today	Andikho kuyo namhlanje
But a word before you do.	Kodwa ilizwi ngaphambi kokuba wenze.
He's right next to me now.	Ulapha ecaleni kwam ngoku.
I wanted to be with you	Bendifuna ukuba nawe
Himself, then.	Ngokwakhe, ngoko.
There was no reason for him to think otherwise.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba acinge ngenye indlela.
Want to know more?	Ngaba ufuna ukwazi ngakumbi?
One day they will come to him.	Ngenye imini baya kuza kuye.
I can't say why now	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni ngoku
I did not want him to leave	Ndandingafuni ukuba ahambe
I have given my daughter a great wedding	Ndinike intombi yam umtshato omkhulu
I know you will want to help.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kufuna ukunceda.
We will all be back together.	Siza kubuya sonke kunye.
If there is a mistake, fine.	Ukuba kukho impazamo, kulungile.
I want to get home.	Ndifuna ukufika ekhaya.
My father never did that.	Utata zange ayenze lonto.
I think you should do that completely	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uyenze loo nto ngokupheleleyo
Yeah, just about anything.	Ewe, malunga nantoni na.
I thought, you're just scared	Ndacinga, uyoyika nje
I suspect this is the case.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba oku kunjalo.
That is not the problem.	Ayisiyiyo ke loo nto ingxaki.
We will definitely be back one day.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kubuya ngenye imini.
He never told me when, like.	Akazange andixelele ukuba nini, njengokuba.
I can't help but be tired	Andikwazi ukuzibamba ndidiniwe
I thought it was okay too	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile nam
I don't know about.	Andazi malunga.
I'm really tired now	Ndidiniwe nyani ngoku
I'll see him.	Ndiza kubona kuye.
There's where I'm going	Kukho apho ndiya khona
I wonder how he does it	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uyenza njani
I was hoping you knew what was going on	Bendinethemba lokuba uyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
Impossible, however.	Akunakwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
That's me, though.	Ndim lowo, nangona kunjalo.
He will take the place.	Uya kuthatha indawo.
I can't imagine what you think	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba ucinga ntoni
All is well.	Konke kulungile kakhulu.
In my bed.	Ebhedini yam.
This time it probably isn't.	Ngeli xesha mhlawumbi akunjalo.
House, marriage, work.	Indlu, umtshato, umsebenzi.
I never heard of him	Andizange ndive ngaye
I don't know what's going on with this	Andiqondi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni ngale nto
And then the question.	Kwaye ke umbuzo.
I don't think we will ever do that	Andiqondi ukuba siya kuze senze njalo
I have to tell her what happened.	Kufuneka ndimxelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
It seemed like something to do.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto yokwenza.
Look at your father.	Jonga utata wakho.
I didn't tell you anything	Khange ndikuxelele nto
I need to see my father	Kufuneka ndibone utata
He wanted life with her.	Wayefuna ubomi kunye naye.
I think my mom loves him, too	Ndicinga ukuba umama uyamthanda, naye
I did it up last week	Ndenze phezulu kwiveki ephelileyo
I have to see that you love someone else	Kufuneka ndibone ukuba uyamthanda omnye umntu
Bad, bad problem.	Ingxaki embi, embi.
I think it will be soon	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kungekudala
Or no one else.	Okanye akukho namnye umntu.
I did something else	Ndenze enye into
Not come by himself.	Hayi eze ngokwakhe.
I mean, really, he doesn't need to know	Ndithetha ukuba, ngenene, akufuneki ukuba azi
If so it is fine.	Ukuba kunjalo kulungile.
And then there is everyone.	Kwaye ke kukho wonke umntu.
I'm not sure at the moment	Andiqinisekanga ngeli xesha
You can do it if you want to.	Ungayenza ukuba uyafuna.
We will leave later.	Siza kuhamba emva kwexesha.
There was once a reason.	Kwakhe kwakho isizathu.
There was no need for him to say more.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe ngakumbi.
I hope you stay	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhlala
I need to know if you exist.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba ukhona na.
Not so for him.	Akunjalo kuye.
I want you just as much as you want me	Ndifuna wena kanye njengokuba ufuna mna
I never had a bad one	Andizange ndibe nayo embi
And that's fine.	Kwaye oko kuhle.
I know a lot about you	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngawe
He realized that he did not want to reveal his name.	Waqonda ukuba akafuni kuthetha igama lakhe.
He told her he wanted the night early.	Wamxelela ukuba ufuna ubusuku kwangethuba.
I did not want to be there	Ndandingafuni ukuba lapho
This makes it very difficult for her to read.	Oku kwenza kube nzima kakhulu kuye ukufunda.
So I decided	Ndagqiba ke ngoko
I thought of leaving	Ndacinga ukuhamba
That's probably why.	Yiyo loo nto mhlawumbi.
I heard nothing from him after that	Andizange ndive nto kuye emva koko
I could not go.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuya.
Your voice.	Ilizwi lakho.
I want to be alone in it	Ndifuna ukuba ndedwa kuyo
Someone has to do that.	Kufuneka umntu enze njalo.
I was thinking about it a lot	Bendicinga ngayo kakhulu
We know for sure that something is going to happen or not.	Siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka okanye hayi.
I had to go with it.	Bekufanele ndihambe nayo.
You look good, too.	Ukhangeleka ulungile, nawe.
But no one really knows.	Kodwa akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
How can I do it.	Ndingayenza njani.
Then go.	Uze uhambe.
So he came to her and sat down with her.	Weza ke kuye, wahlala naye.
Maybe you already have it.	Mhlawumbi sele unayo.
That's the thing, of course.	Nantso into, kunjalo.
And what's inside? 	Kwaye kukho ntoni ngaphakathi?
I'll have to do it all	Kuya kufuneka ndiyenze yonke
I'm going to it.	Ndiya kuyo.
You can do it at night.	Ungayenza ebusuku.
I look forward to doing it with you !.	Ndijonge phambili ekwenzeni nawe!.
I would just like.	Ndingathanda nje.
One is to be a doctor.	Enye kukuba ube ngugqirha.
In a week or two.	Kwiveki okanye ezimbini.
He has gone out and done it for real.	Uye waphuma wayenza ngenene.
We want it to be so.	Sifuna kube njalo.
I do not know at all	Andazi ngokupheleleyo
I do not like food	Andikuthandi ukutya
Just by himself.	Ngokwakhe nje.
I think my dad went to college	Ndicinga ukuba utata uye waya ekholejini
However, he has spoken now.	Nangona kunjalo, uye wathetha ngoku.
I don't have to tell him what's wrong.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndimxelele ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
He searched for an answer.	Wacinga impendulo.
He once asked me my question.	Wakhe wandibuza nje umbuzo wam.
It's you.	Nguwe.
Nice place to be	Indawo entle ukuba
It will come on time.	Iza kufika ngexesha.
I'm sure today.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba namhlanje.
Now we know the truth.	Ngoku siyazi inyaniso.
I doubt, however, that we will succeed	Ndiyathandabuza, nangona kunjalo, ukuba siya kuphumelela
There is no question.	Akukho mbuzo.
I don't want to be sad anymore.	Andifuni kuphinda ndibe buhlungu.
But now it is just that.	Kodwa ngoku kunjalo nje.
I want to go home and	Ndifuna ukuya ekhaya kwaye
And we will try again.	Kwaye siza kuzama kwakhona.
I did not want to go to prison	Ndandingafuni ukuya entolongweni
You will talk to anyone.	Uya kuthetha nabani na.
I wanted time alone with you	Bendifuna ixesha ndedwa nawe
I also can't be late	Nam andikwazi kuba late
I want to know if you have it	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba unayo

It is absolutely necessary.	Kufuneka ngokupheleleyo.
I have to do this, or no one will do it	Kufuneka ndenze oku, okanye akukho mntu uya kwenza
People live at home	Abantu bahlala ekhaya
I love your daughter	Ndiyayithanda intombi yakho
He will wait for you.	Uza kulinda wena.
Well I'm coming your way.	Kulungile ndiza ngendlela yakho.
It was not for nothing.	Kwakungekho kwakutheni.
I live in bed.	Ndihlala ebhedini.
Again, no.	Kwakhona, hayi.
That's what I am.	Yiloo nto ke le.
That might be it.	Inokuba nguye lowo.
I never really told her	Khange ndimxelele nyani
He did not stay for lunch.	Akazange ahlale kwisidlo sasemini.
I don't have to be hard	Akufunekanga ndibe nzima
In this case it is very difficult to do.	Kule meko kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
And it will be easy.	Kwaye kuya kuba lula.
Very nice place	Indawo entle kakhulu
Or here, one.	Okanye apha, enye.
I will stay with you	Ndiya kuhlala nawe
I was hoping everything was fine	Bendinethemba lokuba yonke into ilungile
I never thought about it, to be honest	Andizange ndicinge ngayo, xa ndithetha inyani
Not his dad, though.	Hayi utata wakhe, nangona kunjalo.
I think the whole message is good.	Ndicinga ukuba umyalezo wonke ulungile.
I haven't seen him before tonight	Andizange ndimbone ngaphambili ngokuhlwanje
I had to do this.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze le nto.
It is strange to say this.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ukuyithetha le.
I thought he would be here	Bendicinga uzakuba lapha
At first it was not difficult at this point.	Ekuqaleni kwakungekho nzima kule nto.
She knew he loved her.	Wayesazi ukuba uyamthanda.
I thought you would like him to know	Bendicinga ungathanda ukuba azi
I decided to go, to work	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndihambe, ndiye emsebenzini
Now, and he got away from it.	Ngoku, kwaye wemka kuyo.
I did not go to him.	Khange ndiye kuye.
He saw more than that.	Wabona ngaphezu koko.
I think it's just a thing	Ndicinga ukuba yinto nje
I can certainly wait a few hours	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyakwazi ukulinda iiyure ezimbalwa
Just another woman.	Omnye umfazi nje.
I can't talk to you right now	Andikwazi ukuthetha nawe ngoku
You have finally decided to do this.	Ekugqibeleni uye wagqiba ukwenza oku.
Nobody wanted to talk about it.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Good wife, too	Umfazi omhle, naye
This happened.	Kwenzeka oku.
I really want to do that	Ndifuna kakhulu ukwenza oko
I think you will do well in it	Ndicinga ukuba uya kwenza kakuhle kuyo
What is happening to us is real.	Into eyenzekayo kuthi yinyani.

I knew it would be so easy	Ndandisazi ukuba kube lula kakhulu
I could not think at all	Khange ndikwazi tu ukucinga
You and him.	Wena kunye naye.
I was thinking the same thing last night	Bendicinga into enye phezolo
If you are interested help me.	Ukuba unomdla ndincede.
I did not go all the way	Khange ndihambe yonke indlela
I have to do things my way	Kufuneka ndenze izinto ngendlela yam
Everything that.	Yonke into ukuba.
Other than that, there is none.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho.
Tomorrow we will be with him.	Ngomso siya kuba naye.
No one came to us at that time.	Akukho mntu wakha weza kuthi ngelo xesha.
We are not going anywhere.	Asiyi ndawo apha.
He also did not speak the truth.	Naye khange athethe nyani.
I just wanted to talk to you	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha nawe
I'm sorry it's me.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokuba ndim.
I would love for you to come with her.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba uze naye.
I did not see him clearly	Andizange ndimbone ngokucacileyo
And, it seems, he can't do it.	Kwaye, kubonakala ngathi, akanakuyenza loo nto.
I will tell him what happened	Ndiza kumxelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
This is just not the case.	Oku akukho nje.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
That will end today.	Oko kuya kuphela namhlanje.
I wish he ate more.	Ndinqwenela ukuba atye ngakumbi.
You have to stay here.	Kufuneka uhlale apha.
I never saw him again	Zange ndiphinde ndimbone
I have never heard anything like this before	Andizange ndive into enje ngaphambili
He wanted bad money.	Wayefuna imali embi.
No one in my time.	Akukho mntu ngexesha lam.
That is exactly what is happening to us.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kuthi.
And he did it again.	Kwaye wayenza kwakhona.
I knew he would be with you	Bendisazi ukuba uzakuba nawe
He said no thank you.	Wathi hayi enkosi.
I want that like you	Ndifuna oko njengawe
Everything is very well done.	Yonke into yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu.
We will buy coffee or something.	Siza kuthenga ikofu okanye enye into.
Although he also learned, a lot.	Nangona naye wafunda, kakhulu.
Reading a big book.	Ukufunda incwadi enkulu.
They say it has never been this good.	Bathi akuzange kube kuhle ngolu hlobo.
Maybe soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala.
A little about us.	Kancinci ngathi.
I had no idea what was going on	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni
And now is our chance.	Kwaye ngoku ithuba lethu.
I don't know, really	Andazi, ngenene
Soon, he finished.	Kungekudala, wagqiba.
You have become a car.	Ube imoto.
I can't do it	Andikwazi ukuyenza
He came into my room.	Wangena egumbini lam.
He really came in this time.	Wangena ngenene ngeli xesha.
I can't even talk to him	Andikwazi tu ukuthetha naye
I hope others will do the same.	Ndiyathemba ukuba abanye baya kwenza njalo.
I want everyone there	Ndifuna wonke umntu apho
There was nothing that he did.	Kwakungekho nto ayenzileyo.
I know how hard it is to quit.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani ukuyeka.
Yes, and indeed.	Ewe, kwaye ngokwenene.
Books, he thought.	Iincwadi, wacinga.
Everyone knows.	Wazi wonke umntu.
I will know that you are here	Ndiza kukwazi ukuba ulapha
I want to know why	Ndifuna ukwazi isizathu
I wish you were gone.	Ndinqwenela ukuba uhambe.
I really want to know what happened in the end.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ekugqibeleni.
I will need another place	Ndiza kufuna enye indawo
But it is almost impossible.	Kodwa phantse akunakwenzeka.
More on that please.	Ngakumbi koko nceda.
I had to stay with him	Kwafuneka ndihlale naye
And then, nothing.	Kwaye ke, akukho nto.
He wants me right away.	Ufuna mna ngoko nangoko.
He certainly will not come	Ngokuqinisekileyo akayi kuza
He learned more.	Wafunda ngakumbi.
She is very scared.	Woyika kakhulu.
I just know that there is.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba kukho.
How do I do that.	Ndiyenza njani lonto .
Well, there is something wrong with it.	Kulungile, kukho into engalunganga ngayo.
And until then.	Kwaye kude kube ngoko.
Thank you so much for doing this.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokwenza oku.
Please say yes.	Ndicela uthi ewe.
But no one is good.	Kodwa akukho mntu ulungile.
That seems very likely.	Oko kubonakala kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
I live with it every day	Ndihlala nayo yonke imihla
I think your mother told me about it	Ndicinga ukuba umama wakho undixelele ngayo
Then you have to make a decision.	Emva koko kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
I can't do this to you right now	Andikwazi ukwenza lento kuwe ngoku
It would be good for you, okay.	Bekuya kuba kuhle kuwe, kulungile.
He stayed there for two hours.	Wahlala apho iiyure ezimbini.
I tried to walk beside him	Ndazama ukuhamba ecaleni kwakhe
I didn’t tell her about it, though	Andizange ndimxelele ngaloo nto, nangona kunjalo
I think you should probably talk to her about it	Ndicinga ukuba mhlawumbi kufuneka uthethe naye ngale nto
I got there first	Ndifike kuqala apho
He is absolutely right.	Unjalo ngokupheleleyo.
An unusual problem.	Ingxaki engaqhelekanga.
I know nothing about myself	Andazi nto ngam
I think this will do	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kwenza
I have figured out a way	Ndiye ndacinga indlela
Once in a while.	Kanye ngexesha.
He just wasn't in it.	Wayengekho nje kuyo.

I can't wait to get there.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukufika apho.
I can imagine he was talking everywhere	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga ukuba wayethetha yonke indawo
I can't wait to work	Andikwazi ukulinda ukusebenza
I thought he would never come back	Ndandicinga ukuba akasayi kubuya
Everyone in the area knows what is going on there.	Wonke umntu kuloo ndawo uyayazi into eyenzekayo apho.
I had to make it happen	Kwafuneka ndiyenze yenzeke
I did not know where	Ndandingazi ukuba phi
He wanted everything.	Wayefuna yonke into.
Thank you for this song.	Enkosi ngale ngoma.
This happened to me.	Oku kwenzeka kum.
I had to think of a way to do better	Kwafuneka ndicinge indlela yokwenza ngcono
I did not look inside	Khange ndijonge ngaphakathi
I want to play with my kids	Ndifuna ukudlala nabantwana bam
Just doing this over and over and over and over again.	Ukwenza nje oku kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
Sure, that's fine.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kulungile.
I haven't seen it lately.	Khange ndibone mva nje.

It always is, it always will be.	Kuhlala kukho, kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
I want more from you, to us	Ndifuna ngakumbi kuwe, kuthi
Please stay well.	Nceda uhlale kakuhle.
I did not even know if anyone had bought this place	Ndandingazi nokuba umntu uthenge le ndawo
Not really focused on it.	Hayi ngokwenene ingqalelo kuyo.
You can really do this.	Ungayenza ngokwenene oku.
I never did this again until recently	Andizange ndiphinde ndiyenze le nto kude kube mva nje
Now you have done it.	Ngoku uyenzile.
I think there was nothing he tried to do	Ndicinga ukuba akukho nto wazama ukuyenza
No he didn't.	Hayi akazange.
Then he walked out of my room.	Emva koko waphuma egumbini lam.
I think often.	Ndicinga rhoqo.
Then it becomes easier.	Emva koko kuba lula.
I can do this, no problem	Ndingayenza le nto, akukho ngxaki

I got my dad here.	Ndifike utata apha.
You really have hope.	Ngenene unethemba.
He has been even more so.	Uye waba nangona kakhulu.
No, there was nobody there at the time.	Hayi, kwakungekho mntu ngelo xesha.
There is.	Kukho .
In this case it is not.	Kule meko akunjalo.
Yes, yes he is.	Ewe, ewe unjalo.
I'd better get home, she thought	Kungcono ndifike ekhaya, wacinga
And that's a good thing.	Kwaye yinto entle.
I want to read this book	Ndifuna ukufunda le ncwadi
I will try to be.	Ndiza kuzama ukuba.
So very, very tired.	Ngoko kakhulu, ndidiniwe kakhulu.
I'll start tomorrow	Ndiza kuqala kusasa
Everyone wanted to meet him	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukudibana naye
I don't know what's in it.	Andazi ukuba kukho ntoni na kuyo.
I had no idea what my problem was	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yam

I do not remember anything.	Andikhumbuli nto.
So very good.	Ngoko kuhle kakhulu.

That's all.	Yinto yonke.
I wanted to do it	Ndandifuna ukuyenza
In this and only.	Kule nto kwaye kuphela.
It will definitely come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuza.

Look inside and walk away	Ujonge ngaphakathi kwaye uhambe
Well, that's it.	Kulungile, yiyo loo nto.
But that is not the case today.	Kodwa akunjalo namhlanje.
And then he got angry because he was angry.	Kwaye ke waba nomsindo ngenxa yokuba nomsindo.
It is very old indeed	Kudala kakhulu ngenene
Money a woman does not know about.	Imali umfazi akazi ngayo.

I am not alone	Ayindim ndedwa
I think you should.	Ndicinga ukuba ufanele.
So, no, it's not.	Ngoko, hayi, akunjalo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi naye akazange enjenjalo.
If so there.	Ukuba kunjalo apho.
Reading, reading, reading.	Ukufunda, ukufunda, ukufunda.
But he clearly did not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akazange.
My father.	Utata wam.
I don't believe you have time	Andikholelwa ukuba unexesha
I won't be out there, either	Andiyi kuba phaya phandle, nam
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba ucinge ngale nto.
I think he realized it was me	Ndicinga ukuba waqonda ukuba ndim
Otherwise it is impossible to work.	Ngaphandle koko akunakwenzeka ukusebenza.
That really is old.	Oko ngenene kudala.
Certainly tonight they will come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngokuhlwanje baya kuza.
A little bit earlier.	Kancinci kancinci ngaphambili.
You should know.	Ufanele uyazi.
We should stay together.	Sifanele ukuhlala kunye.
I want it all.	Ndifuna konke.

He was doing one at school.	Wayenza enye esikolweni.
I don't think it's right.	Andiqondi ukuba kulungile.
I do not know you in front of him	Andikwazi phambi kwakhe
Another went to college.	Omnye waya ekholejini.
All the way away.	Yonke indlela kude.
He will never go again.	Akasayi kuphinda ahambe.
He asked for help himself.	Wacela uncedo ngokwakhe.
I want to help others.	Ndifuna ukunceda abanye.
Not so.	Hayi ke ngoko.
I had no idea he was just a human being	Ndandingazi ukuba ungumntu nje
I never said that	Khange ndithethe ngolo hlobo

Of course not.	Akunjalo ke, kunjalo.
I can't tell him the truth yet	Andikwazi kumxelela inyani okwangoku
I know what you are talking about	Ndiyayazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni
As it is very difficult to say more.	Njengoko kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngakumbi.
Yes, it has.	Ewe, kuye kwenzeka.
Sorry but no.	Uxolo kodwa hayi.

I never came here, of course	Andizange ndize apha, kunjalo

Yes yes yes.	Ewe ewe ewe.
He is ready to talk to you if you want.	Ukulungele ukuthetha nawe ukuba uyafuna.
Then he said he wanted to drive.	Emva koko wathi ufuna ukuqhuba.
There was no talking.	Kwakungekho kuthetha.
I know better, though	Ndiyazi ngcono, nangona kunjalo
Well, here it is.	Kulungile, yiyo le.

I couldn't figure out what that was	Andizange ndikwazi ukufumana ukuba yintoni na loo nto

That will happen soon.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
I do not know where my wife and children are	Andazi ukuba uphi umfazi nabantwana bam

But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I love this one, really	Ndiyayithanda le, ngokwenene

It should be that it is not easy to do.	Kufuneka kube ukuba akukho lula ukwenza.
I don't want to go there again	Andifuni ukuya apho kwakhona

At that moment my mother realized, too.	Ngelo xesha umama waqonda, naye.
There is a time to be angry.	Kukho ixesha lokuba nomsindo.
I never saw him do it	Andizange ndimbone ukuba enze njani

It will not be easy for you.	Akuyi kuba lula kuwe.
Unless there is.	Ngaphandle xa kukho.
Do not try to control yourself.	Musa ukuzama ukuzibamba wedwa.
I am sure you will succeed.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kuphumelela.
I just need to see something	Kufuneka ndibone into nje
At the time, too.	Ngelo xesha, nayo.
I would like to work again	Ndingathanda ukusebenza kwakhona
I've been here a long time	Ndihambe apha kudala
But eventually he went there.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waya apho.
I'm not sure what to do about it	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto
This is the case now.	Oku kunjalo ngoku.
Now everyone has done many other things.	Ngoku wonke umntu wenze ezinye izinto ezininzi.
He said my name.	Wathi igama lam.
It just has to happen.	Kufuneka yenzeke nje.
Not just me, but him.	Hayi mna kuphela, kodwa kuye.
I wonder why that is	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni kunjalo
But nothing now.	Kodwa akukho nto ngoku.
I have to stay after that	Kufuneka ndihlale emva koko
I have no money right now	Andinayo imali ngoku
So much more.	Ngoko kakhulu ngakumbi.
Then he stays in the hospital.	Emva koko uhlala esibhedlele.
What you are sure of.	Oko uqinisekile ngayo.
I made a big mistake.	Ndenza impazamo enkulu.
He does it perfectly.	Uyenza ngokupheleleyo.
And he didn't look like he wanted to.	Kwaye akazange abonakale ngathi uyafuna.
I thought you told her about it	Bendicinga ukuba umxelele ngalonto
Don't talk like that.	Musa ukuthetha ngolo hlobo.
Or maybe it wasn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi yayingenguye.
I can't wait to go shopping	Andikwazi kulinda ukuya kuthenga
I don't remember what we should have done	Andikhumbuli ukuba bekufanele senze ntoni
And I'm not the only one.	Kwaye ayindim kuphela.
I'm tired.	Ndidiniwe mna.
You better tell me	Kungcono undixelele
I think you already know why	Ndicinga ukuba sele uyazi ukuba kutheni
Maybe you want to be outside.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuba ngaphandle.
Or you may have more children.	Okanye unokuba nabantwana abaninzi.
I think he was talking about her	Ndicinga ukuba wayethetha ngaye
I wish it happened regularly	Ndinqwenela ukuba kwenzeke rhoqo
Deciding what to do.	Ukwenza isigqibo malunga nokuba siza kwenza ntoni na.
Now I know a little about him, yeah	Ngoku ndiyazi kancinci ngaye, ewe
I'm not sure that's a bad thing.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinto embi leyo.
I know you went with him	Ndiyazi ukuba uhambe naye
He will be there tomorrow.	Uzakuba lapho ngomso kusasa.
I have to think about it a little bit	Kufuneka ndicinge ngayo kancinci
I feel like I made the night for it.	Ndiziva ngathi ndenze ubusuku ngayo.
If you don't think so, that's fine.	Ukuba awucingi njalo, kulungile.
I'll wait here until tomorrow.	Ndilinde apha kude kube ngomso.
You can do it internally.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza ngaphakathi.
There is not much to do.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza.
I would like to stay with you.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala nawe.
I think this is better.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kungcono.
I think he has been harder than I am	Ndicinga ukuba uye waba nzima kunam
I can't help you there	Andikwazi ukukunceda apho
I did not know anyone there	Ndandingazi mntu apho
If someone makes a mistake, that person may be aware of it.	Ukuba umntu wenza impazamo, loo mntu usenokuba uyayazi loo nto.
I've seen the same thing, you know	Ndibone into efanayo, uyazi
That's why he wanted to talk to me.	Yiyo loo nto wayefuna ukuthetha nam.
I would like to do it.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza.
You have to go there too.	Kufuneka uye apho nawe.
I thought	Bendicinga
I wanted to do a few things before that	Ndandifuna ukwenza izinto ezimbalwa ngaphambi koko
Tell me something else.	Ndixelele enye into leyo.
Maybe you want money.	Mhlawumbi ufuna imali.
I thought it might be you	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba nguwe
Yes, this is really happening.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
So until that happens.	Ngoko de kwenzeke oko.
What are you doing here for a long time? 	Wenza ntoni ixesha elide apha?
you must come to me.	kufuneka uze kum.
We want to know how or why.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
Wrong place.	Indawo engalunganga.
I think you are tired now	Ndicinga ukuba udiniwe ngoku
This means a lot.	Oku kuthetha kakhulu.
This evening will be fun.	Ngoku ngokuhlwa kuya kuba mnandi.
I don't remember that, either.	Andikhumbuli naloo nto, nam.
You know that is not the case.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I would love to see more though.	Ndingathanda ukubona ngakumbi nangona.
I did not want her to talk about me.	Bendingafuni athethe ngam.
I wanted his attention	Ndandifuna ingqalelo yakhe
You feel and you look so much better	Uziva kwaye ukhangeleka engcono kakhulu
Two hours.	Iiyure ezimbini.
I want it right when possible	Ndifuna ilungile xa kunokwenzeka
You know what you like to do.	Uyazi ukuba uyathanda ukwenza.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo abazange.
No, no better.	Hayi, hayi ngcono.
Very little, obviously	Kancinci kakhulu, ngokucacileyo
We did something together.	Senze into kunye.
I hope to work with you	Ndiyathemba ukusebenza nawe
I got in the car.	Ndifike emotweni.
I have to do.	Kufuneka ndenze.
I do not know exactly what happened	Andazi ncam ukuba kwenzeka ntoni
I really want to see you try	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukubona uzama
He knew more.	Wayesazi ngakumbi.
It is very difficult to work on it.	Kunzima kakhulu ukusebenza kuyo.
I can do this if you want it done	Ndingayenza le nto ukuba ufuna yenziwe
Well, it didn't.	Ewe, ayizange.
I want to know	Ndifuna ukwazi
I will not say otherwise	Andiyi kuthetha ngenye indlela
I wanted to stay there.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala apho.
I want nothing from him.	Andifuni nto kuye.
I have to do this now	Kufuneka ndiyenze le nto ngoku
I thought that was strange.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
I can't come now, not today	Andikwazi ukuza ngoku, hayi namhlanje
I can come every day	Ndiyakwazi ukuza yonke imihla
And he saw there.	Kwaye wabona apho.
And finally, you will want to.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, uya kufuna.
Tell me this is possible.	Ndixelele oku kunokwenzeka.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba kuhle kuthi.
Everyone is doing something great.	Wonke umntu wenza into enkulu.
For me.	Kuba mna.
I thought there was another way to do it.	Ndacinga apho ngenye indlela yokwenza oko.
Not two.	Hayi ezimbini.
I wish I could find a better person	Ndinqwenela ukufumana umntu ongcono
I heard one recently	Ndeva enye kungekudala
I too wish I could do some more.	Nam ndinqwenela ukwenza ezinye.
I don't remember how far back	Andikhumbuli ukuba kude kangakanani emva
Soon he proposed marriage to her.	Zange kube kudala wacela umtshato kuye.
And he works in town to go.	Kwaye usebenza edolophini ukuya.
This means something.	Oku kuthetha into.
He pulled out something new.	Wakhupha into entsha.
He wants a picture of her.	Ufuna umfanekiso wakhe.
I did not think so.	Ndandingacingi ngolo hlobo.
You are doing very well, you are optimistic.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu, unethemba.
I thought you should know the truth	Bendicinga ukuba kufuneka uyazi inyani
He told police.	Uxelele amapolisa.
Before that, nothing.	Ngaphambi koko, akukho nto.
He tried to imagine what had happened.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, ngokucacileyo oku akunjalo.
I'm so sorry for what happened to you	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngale nto yenzekileyo kuwe
I can't afford that	Andikwazi ukuthenga oko
Soon, the long wait will end.	Kungekudala, ukulinda ixesha elide kuya kuphela.
We did our job with all that.	Senze umsebenzi wethu ngayo yonke loo nto.
Any of it.	Nayiphi na kuyo.
Only one time.	Ixesha elinye kuphela.
I do not believe it to be true	Andikholelwa ukuba yinyani
But that's one thing.	Kodwa leyo yinto enye.
He was thinking nothing.	Wayengacingi nto.
He has continued.	Uye waqhubeka.
I can't say enough of this	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo oku
Then he became her friend	Emva koko waba ngumhlobo wakhe
I didn't know much about him	Ndandingazi kakhulu ngaye
I can't wait to quit my job	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuyeka umsebenzi wam
Not here, of course.	Hayi apha, kunjalo.
But that is about to happen.	Kodwa kwenzeka loo nto.
No one has ever been able to do that.	Akukho mntu uye wakwazi ukwenza oko.
I'll do it for you otherwise	Ndiza kukwenza kuwe ngenye indlela
He says he wants a job.	Uthi ufuna umsebenzi.
And this place.	Kwaye le ndawo.
Tell me now what happened.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I think money is right	Ndicinga ukuba imali ilungile
I can't do such a thing	Andikwazi ukwenza into enjalo
I know he wants to tell you himself	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukukuxelela ngokwakhe
I know you have my number	Ndiyayazi unayo inombolo yam
You just got here.	Ufike nje apha.
I would like to know if they live in the same room.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba bahlala kwigumbi elinye.
A really nice place to stay	Indawo entle ngokwenene yokuhlala
She will have to talk to him about it.	Kuya kufuneka athethe naye ngaloo nto.
Good to be here.	Kuhle ukuba lapha.
No problem, they say.	Akukho ngxaki, bathi.
I did not want to stay in that place	Ndandingafuni ukuhlala kuloo ndawo
As much as we want to try.	Kangangoko sifuna ukuzama.
There are others, of course.	Kukho abanye, kunjalo.
Maybe that would be a good thing, though.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba yinto entle, nangona kunjalo.
I knew it wasn't	Ndandisazi ukuba akunjalo
Travel will be fine	Ukuhamba kuya kuba kuhle
I just want a place	Ndifuna nje indawo
I gave my mother some money.	Ndinike umama enye imali.
I want to do this	Ndifuna ukwenza oku
Long time no see	Kudala ndikwazi
He does everything well.	Uyenza kakuhle yonke into.
I wanted to know more	Ndandifuna ukwazi izinto ezininzi
I want to know what's going on with you	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni ngawe
He didn't do it for us.	Khange enze ngathi.
He wants to be there.	Uyafuna ukuba lapho.
Then and there.	Emva koko kwaye apho.
Next week it will be a little harder.	Kwiveki ezayo iya kuba nzima kancinci.
I want my life.	Ndifuna ubomi bam.
He came by himself.	Weza ngokwakhe.
I wanted him to know	Bendifuna azi
Just trying.	Ukuzama nje.
It really is my job.	Ngokwenene ngumsebenzi wam.
To make everything easier.	Ukuze yonke into yenziwe lula.
Soon it will be better.	Kungekudala kungcono.
I just wanted to drive	Bendifuna nje ukuqhuba
At first he did not know what it was.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
Give me something.	Ndinike into.
To me.	Ukuya kum.
I can not wait!!.	Andikwazi kulinda!!.
You know, maybe not.	Uyazi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I can't live with that	Andikwazi ukuhlala naloo nto
Really sorry.	Nyani uxolo kakhulu.
Someone has to help someone.	Umntu kufuneka amncede umntu.
How strange his father	Indlela engaqhelekanga utata wakhe
I think it's time for you to know	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha lokuba uyazi
Or me, of course.	Okanye mna, kunjalo.
I read it all the time, very quickly.	Ndifunde njalo, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I'm just waiting.	Ndilinde nje.
I can't say what it is	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni
Not so much right now.	Hayi kakhulu okwangoku.
That is why.	Kunjalo ke isizathu.
Thank you for being there for her.	Enkosi ngokuba nguye apho kuye.
I did not speak to him	khange ndithethe naye
I never thought of anything better than him	Andizange ndicinge enye into entle ngaphezu kwakhe
He tried to see everything.	Wazama ukubona yonke into.
I did not know all this	Bendingayazi yonke lento
The question is how good it is.	Umbuzo kukuba kuhle kangakanani.
I don't know, really.	Andazi, ngenene.
This is him.	Le nguye.
If you know that.	Ukuba uyakwazi oko.
Everyone.	Bonke abantu.
I will do that again.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
As good as that happened.	Njengokuba kulungile oko kwenzeka.
I want him to say more	Ndifuna athethe ngakumbi
One.	Omnye.
I can't tell you why.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ukuba kutheni.
I can't think of one bad thing	Andikwazi ukucinga into enye embi
I can't speak right away	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngoko nangoko
We had to do it again	Kwafuneka siyenze kwakhona
I have to think.	Ndifanele ukucinga.
If this is the case.	Ukuba oku kunjalo.
If he needed help.	Ukuba wayefuna uncedo.
It happens to almost everyone	Kwenzeka phantse kuye wonke umntu
Just a mother.	Umama nje.
I would like to work	Ndingathanda ukusebenza
I will stay with you here and wait for this	Ndiza kuhlala nawe apha kwaye ndilinde oku
However it seems likely that this will be the case.	Nangona kunjalo kubonakala ngathi oku kuya kuba njalo.
I did not tell anyone about what he had done to me	Khange ndixelele mntu ngale nto ayenzileyo kum
That's the speech, of course.	Nantso intetho, kunjalo.
Slightly weird, but okay.	Kancinci engaqhelekanga, kodwa kulungile.
He felt the need to be alone.	Waziva efuna ukuba yedwa.
He almost did just that.	Uphantse wenza kanye oko.
That is very possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
I can't do this to myself	Andikwazi kuyenza le nto kum
I will dwell in you, and I will be with you;	ndiya kuhlala kuwe, ndibe nawe;
Everyone is talking about us, he thought.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngathi, wacinga.
No one was talking about anything.	Akukho mntu wayethetha ngayo nayiphi na into.
I'm just human.	Ndingumntu nje.
Not bad.	Hayi kakubi.
I'll take this one earlier.	Ndiza kuthatha le ngaphambili.
I did not know what he was talking about at the time.	Ndandingazi ukuba wayethetha ngantoni ngelo xesha.
I don't remember what happened	Andikhumbuli ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
And a lot of the time.	Kwaye ixesha elininzi.
But he did it for his own sake.	Kodwa wakwenza oko, ngenxa yakhe.
I did something then	Ndenze into ngoko
I went to our room the night just after dinner	Ndihambe ndaya egumbini lethu ebusuku nje emva kwesidlo sangokuhlwa
He talked a lot.	Wathetha kakhulu.
He knew he was scared.	Wayesazi ukuba uyoyika.
But then, certainly, he won’t be.	Kodwa ke, ngokuqinisekileyo, akayi kuba.
You definitely do not want music.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awufuni umculo.
I've never done it before	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili
Then he looked down.	Emva koko wajonga phantsi.
I did not wait to see what they would do	Andizange ndilinde ukubona ukuba baza kwenza ntoni
Who really wants to live in that ?.	Ngubani ngokwenene ofuna ukuhlala kuloo nto?.
Maybe more than that you need to know.	Mhlawumbi ngaphezu koko kufuneka ukwazi.
But no one really knows.	Kodwa akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
I was looking for a job	Bendifuna umsebenzi
Yes, it is and it is not.	Ewe, kunjalo kwaye akunjalo.
I never saw him again	Andizange ndimbone emva koko
And it is very difficult to read.	Kwaye kunzima kakhulu ukufunda.
And there now, he saw.	Kwaye apho ngoku, wabona.
He realized he knew nothing about her.	Waqonda ukuba akazi nto ngaye.
Something new or a toy or something	Into entsha okanye into yokudlala okanye into
I think you should wait a few years.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ulinde iminyaka embalwa.
And that goes on now though.	Ke oko kuya phambili ngoku nangona kunjalo.
I'm sure some of his work is really good.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba omnye umsebenzi wakhe ulungile ngenene.
I feel like a long time ago	Ndiziva ngathi kudala
Your turn, now.	Ithuba lakho, ngoku.
There's just you.	Kukho wena nje.
I know the place	Ndiyayazi indawo
I talk to him every day	Ndithetha naye yonke imihla
I thought that was a good thing	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo
I will do this alone	Le nto ndiza kuyenza ndedwa
It is our job to succeed.	Ngumsebenzi wethu ukuphumelela.
I did not want her to be alone	Ndandingafuni abe yedwa
I think you should do that	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uyenze loo nto
Tell people about it.	Xelela abantu ngayo.
I'll tell her, for now	Ndiza kumxelela, okwangoku
I know what happened next	Ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko
Just tell me the truth.	Ndixelele nje inyani.
I just love the place	Ndiyayithanda nje indawo
I just want to be here with you	Ndifuna nje ukuba lapha nawe
That is exactly what he wants to do.	Yiloo nto kanye afuna ukuyenza.
It's hard to be a man.	Kunzima ukuba yindoda.
I do too.	Ndiyenza nam.
I wonder how you feel.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uziva njani.
No matter how well we do.	Nokuba siyenze kakuhle kangakanani na.
Talk to you soon	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala
I mean think about it	Ndithetha ukucinga ngayo
I think that's a big deal	Ndicinga ukuba yinto enkulu leyo
Not something that happened.	Hayi into eyenzekayo.
All very quickly.	Konke ngokukhawuleza.
I wanted to know, too	Ndandifuna ukwazi, nam
I haven't seen him since.	Andizange ndimbone ukusukela ngoko.
Then he fell asleep.	Emva koko walala.
I can do things again	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza izinto kwakhona
He had done this before.	Wayenza le nto ngaphambili.
Then the gift comes to him.	Emva koko isipho siza kuye.
I like it too.	Ndiyayithanda nam.
You can't think of yourself that way.	Awukwazi ukucinga ngawe ngolo hlobo.
A little to think about.	Kancinci ukucinga ngayo.
I did not see anyone	Khange ndibone mntu
Just a big mistake, really.	Impazamo enkulu nje, ngenene.
I know you would like that	Ndiyazi ukuba ungathanda oko
I want to know what you are going to do	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba uza kwenza ntoni
I do not know yet.	Andazi okwangoku.
I don't need to talk too much.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe kakhulu.
I really should have	Ngenene ndifanele ukuba
He wanted a plan, he thought of a plan.	Wayefuna icebo, wacinga icebo.
Don't go out.	Musa ukuphuma.
Soon better, really.	Kungekudala ngcono, ngokwenene.
I hope you will be there	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuba lapho
Now, however, he looked up.	Ngoku, nangona kunjalo, wajonga phezulu.
Despite everything.	Nangona yonke into.
It just so happens that you live here.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba uhlala apha.
And now she needs your help.	Kwaye ngoku ufuna uncedo lwakho.
I didn't know there was anybody here	Bendingazi ukuba kukho omnye umntu apha
I could not decide what to do	Andizange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba ndenze ntoni
Yeah, it's hard.	Ewe, kunzima.
That is your mistake.	Yiyo ke impazamo yakho.
And so he will do.	Kwaye ngoko uya kwenza.
Yes, they will go and see other people soon.	Ewe, baya kuhamba baye kubona abanye abantu kungekudala.
He did not know what his problem was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
There is just nothing to it.	Akukho nto nje kuyo.
I do not have your number	Andinayo inombolo yakho
Not days and certainly not weeks.	Hayi iintsuku kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi iiveki.
And you can do it at home.	Kwaye ungayenza ekhaya.
They say no.	Bathi hayi.
However, it is difficult to do so	Nangona kunjalo, kunzima ukwenza oko
Is a person.	Ngaba umntu.
Whatever the problem.	Nokuba yintoni ingxaki.
I don't believe in it myself.	Andikholelwa kuyo mna.
I have to be a new person	Kufuneka ndibe ngumntu omtsha
I can't say more at this time.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngakumbi ngeli xesha.
I'm glad you stay.	Ndiyavuya uhlala.
I knew it too.	Nam bendisazi.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
Then it became a strange thing.	Emva koko waba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Maybe you should stay behind if possible.	Mhlawumbi kungcono uhlale ngasemva ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I want you to look at this	Ndifuna ujonge oku
I can do a good job	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza umsebenzi omhle
I hope everyone feels a little better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu uziva ngcono kancinci.
Or if you do not want to.	Okanye ukuba awufuni.
I have to go to school	Kufuneka ndiye esikolweni
I will never see him again	Soze ndiphinde ndimbone
And it's hard to get here.	Kwaye kunzima ukufika apha.
Outside, of course, it was not.	Ngaphandle, kunjalo, kwakungekho.
You can too.	Nawe usenokuba.
It seemed like one, too.	Kwakubonakala ngathi enye, nayo.
I thought something was wrong.	Ndacinga ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
He said, yes, once.	Wathi, ewe, kanye.
The father will never know.	Utata soze azi.
Yes, you can do that.	Ewe, ungayenza loo nto.
Even knowing that, however, we will try.	Nangona ukwazi oko, nangona kunjalo, siza kuzama.
Well done, this job	Ndenze kakuhle, lo msebenzi
Thanks for the work.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi.
I want to know how you slept	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba ulele njani
What's more, what.	Ngaba ngakumbi, yintoni.
It is difficult to do this.	Kunzima ukwenza oku.
You will get there eventually.	Uza kufika apho ekugqibeleni.
Later, perhaps, but for now.	Kamva, mhlawumbi, kodwa okwangoku.
There must be something wrong with me.	Kumele ukuba kukho into engalunganga kum.
I think this is going to be very difficult.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
I could not wait long	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ixesha elide
He walked over to his bed.	Wahamba waya ebhedini yakhe.
He couldn’t help himself, though.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba, nangona kunjalo.
Can someone ask for help ??.	Ngaba umntu ndicela uncedo??.
I don't believe you can do that to him	Andikholelwa ukuba ungayenza loo nto kuye
I can’t stop thinking about it	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngayo
You read this right.	Ufunda oku kulungile.
I love this approach.	Ndiyayithanda le ndlela yokwenza.
I knew nothing about you.	Bendingazi kwanto ngawe.
I was thinking about him.	Ndandicinga ngaye.
But it is good that you did not.	Kodwa kulungile ukuba awuzange.
That would be great.	Oko bekuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
I want to know what you did.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
His mother says so too.	Umama wakhe uthi naye.
He didn't know which one it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yeyiphi.
But it will take a long time to get there.	Kodwa kuya kuthatha ixesha elide ukufika apho.
Not a bad place.	Hayi indawo embi.
No, you're right.	Hayi, ulungile.
You will have plenty of time.	Uya kuba nexesha elininzi.
I wanted you to know, what happened to me.	Bendifuna uyazi, ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
But there was no reason.	Kodwa kwakungekho sizathu.
He's just laying there.	Ulele nje phaya.
It's hard for him, but it's good for us.	Kunzima kuye, kodwa kulungile kuthi.
Clearly, he said yes.	Ngokucacileyo, wathi ewe.
It's the same old thing, the same old thing.	Yinto endala efanayo, endala efanayo.
But not the unusual way.	Kodwa hayi indlela engaqhelekanga.
See my doctor.	Ukubona ugqirha wam.
I thought it would be more than that	Ndandicinga ukuba iya kuba ngaphezu koko
I wanted to be him again	Ndandifuna ukuba nguye kwakhona
I mean everywhere.	Ndithetha yonke indawo.
What now.	Yintoni ngoku.
I want to do my job	Ndifuna ukwenza umsebenzi wam
I'm not here right now.	Andikho apha ngoku.
I know that but	Ndiyayazi lonto kodwa
I can't do what you tell me to do.	Andikwazi ukuyenza lento uthi mandiyenze.
Forward to the top.	Ngaphambili ukuya phezulu.
It seemed so far away.	Kwakubonakala kude ngakumbi.
I never wanted to hear about him again	Bendingafuni kuphinda ndive ngaye
Just play money.	Imali nje yokudlala.
I'm sorry about that	Ndicela uxolo ngalonto
I can't wait long	Andikwazi kulinda ixesha elide
I want to go and see what is going on	Ndifuna ukuya kubona ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni
I’m not sure what’s wrong with it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngayo.
It will be very visible.	Kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
I think you know it by now	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi ngoku
I knew it would happen one day	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini
But this is clearly not the case.	Kodwa oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I know how to play	Ndiyayazi indlela yokudlala
He is just like me.	Lowo ufana nam.
I really wanted to think about it	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukucinga ngayo
I don't know what he's going to take	Andazi ukuba uza kuthatha ntoni na
I am not alone in him	Andikho ndedwa kuye
I think you feel alone now	Ndicinga ukuba uziva wedwa ngoku
I read that anyway	Ndifunde oko kunjalo
I shouldn’t have told her it was okay	Bekungafanelanga ndimxelele ukuba kulungile
I can't live in the city	Andikwazi ukuhlala edolophini
Good question, though	Umbuzo olungileyo, nangona kunjalo
Yes, he wants more.	Ewe, ufuna kakhulu.
I want to know what it is	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na
I'll find a room and we'll see what comes.	Ndiza kufumana igumbi kwaye siza kubona ukuba kuza ntoni.
All of this can be true.	Konke oku kunokuba yinyani.
I can't wait to be his friend	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe
Very good performance	Ukusebenza kakuhle kakhulu
I have never thought about this much before	Khange ndicinge kakhulu ngale nto ngaphambili
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka lonke ixesha.
I heard another story of her tonight	Ndeva elinye ibali lakhe ngokuhlwanje
I did this to us, you, you know	Ndenze oku kuthi, nawe, uyazi
I don't know how I did it but I did it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani kodwa ndiyenzile.
I want a wife one day	Ndifuna umfazi ngenye imini
I like this one.	Ndiyayithanda le.
Yes, it will be difficult.	Ewe, kuya kuba nzima.
I would like to go there soon.	Ndingathanda ukuya khona kungekudala.
I've been easy on you	Ndibe lula kuwe
I do not see anything	Andiboni kwanto
I could not stop speaking	Khange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukuthetha
I didn't want to say it	Bendingafuni ukuyithetha
I had no idea that was it	Ndandingazi ukuba yiloo nto
Then he gave me a job offer.	Emva koko wandinika icebiso ngomsebenzi.
You made a mistake then.	Wenza impazamo ngoko.
I want to be a better man	Ndifuna ukuba yindoda engcono
It will be hard to find.	Kuya kuba nzima ukufumana.
So, don't wait any longer.	Ngoko, musa ukulinda kwakhona.
He says no, everything is fine.	Uthi hayi, yonke into ilungile.
I want to talk about this	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngale nto
Something like that happened.	Kwenzeka into enjalo.
I want him to succeed.	Ndifuna ukuba aphumelele.
I wanted to try to do something else.	Ndandifuna ukuzama ukwenza enye into.
I'm trying to help you.	Ndizama ukukunceda.
I wanted to, but I did not	Ndandifuna, kodwa andizange
I didn't know enough.	Ndandingazi ngokwaneleyo.
I would definitely like to	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingathanda
Go to me.	Iya kum.
He went far and wide.	Waya kude waya kude.
I never looked at him again	Khange ndiphinde ndijonge kuye
Days, weeks maybe.	Iintsuku, iiveki mhlawumbi.
I made a story about him recently	Ndenze ibali ngaye mva nje
It's much better now.	Kungcono kakhulu ngoku.
There is currently no place.	Okwangoku akukho ndawo.
I know what he wants, too.	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo, naye.
Then he will return immediately.	Emva koko uya kubuya kanye.
What a person wants.	Yintoni umntu ayifunayo.
He did not think about work.	Akazange acinge ngomsebenzi.
Probably not	Mhlawumbi andiyi kuba njalo
I do not want another	andifuni enye
Everyone himself.	Wonke umntu ngokwakhe.
I knew the reason, of course	Ndandisazi isizathu, kunjalo
That is something new for me.	Yinto entsha leyo kum.
As possible.	Njengoko kunokwenzeka.
I certainly heard something	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndeva into ethile
This should be easy.	Oku kufuneka kube lula.
Son, wife, mother.	Unyana, umfazi, umama.
The best one.	Enye engcono.
I like it, a little bit	Ndiyayithanda, kancinci
I just wanted to finish it	Ndandifuna nje ukugqiba ngayo
There is a small thing in everything.	Kukho into encinci kuyo yonke into.
A good book.	Incwadi entle.
I can't wait to go to school	Andikwazi kulinda ukuya esikolweni
I doubt if he knows himself	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uyazi na ngokwakhe
You know you can't.	Uyazi ukuba awukwazi.
I don't remember wanting such a bad thing	Andikhumbuli ndifuna into embi kangaka
I never was.	Andizange ndibe njalo.
No one said anything.	Akukho mntu wathetha nto.
They all live there.	Bonke bahlala apho.
This happens a lot every day.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu yonke imihla.
Sitting, thinking.	Ukuhlala, ukucinga.
Now look again.	Ngoku jonga kwakhona.
I'm not so sure	Andiqinisekanga kakhulu
Thank you so much for doing this !.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokwenza oku!.
I thought that would be fun.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba mnandi oko.
I'll be back one day	Ndiza kubuya ngenye imini
It seems to be getting better.	Kubonakala ukuba ngcono.
Maybe something else, too.	Mhlawumbi enye into, nayo.
I am sure it will succeed.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba iya kuphumelela.
You made a mistake.	Uyenzile impazamo.
And once again.	Kwaye kube kanye kwakhona.
Not here, though.	Hayi apha, nangona kunjalo.
I have never been or will be	Andizange ndibe okanye ndiya kuba
I did not hear anything	Andizange ndive nto
But they did not build anything.	Kodwa abazange bakhe nto.
Trying something new.	Ukuzama into entsha.
I hope you will come	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuza
I feel like myself again	Ndiziva njengam kwakhona
He wasn't too much.	Wayengekho kakhulu.
But very good !.	Kodwa kuhle kakhulu!.
I did not get along well with him.	Khange ndihlale kakuhle naye.
I have never been this way before	Andizange ndihambe ngendlela ngaphambili
Give me my gun.	Ndinike umpu wam.
It will never happen again	Andiyi kuphinda yenzeke
Not all, of course.	Hayi yonke, kunjalo.
You are very good at it.	Ulungile kakhulu ngayo.
Not bad, okay.	Hayi kakubi, kulungile.
Or maybe he is asleep.	Okanye mhlawumbi ulele.
That means other things.	Oko kuthetha ezinye izinto.
He looked like this.	Wayekhangeleka enje.
I'm not sure though.	Andiqinisekanga kodwa.
I want you to be inside me, once and for all	Ndifuna ukuba ube ngaphakathi kum, kube kanye
Not bad but not too much.	Hayi kakubi kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He was not too far away.	Akazange abe kude kakhulu.
Then he did.	Emva koko wayenza.
That's fine.	Ilungile ke loo nto.
Right behind you.	Kanye emva kwakho.
It's hard to do anything	Kunzima ukwenza nantoni na
Yes I am.	Ewe ndiqinisekile.
I wanted to be the first	Ndandifuna ukuba ngowokuqala
I'm glad you're here, now	Ndiyavuya ukuba ulapha, ngoku
You have to build somewhere.	Kufuneka yakhe kwindawo ethile.

I did everything in front of me	Ndenze yonke into phambi kwam
I hope you feel good about it	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva kakuhle ngayo
I know how difficult it can be	Ndiyazi ukuba kunokuba nzima kangakanani
What was he thinking, he wondered.	Wayecinga ntoni, wazibuza.
I did something wrong.	Ndenza into engalunganga.
He acts as if he were talking to himself.	Uqhuba ngathi uthetha yedwa.
I do not want to be here without you	Andifuni ukuba lapha ngaphandle kwakho
What and.	Ntoni na.
But not at this time.	Kodwa hayi ngeli xesha.
In the playground.	Kwindawo yokudlala.
I didn't want to hold back	Ndandingafuni ukuzibamba
I never thought he would do it	Khange ndicinge ukuba uya kuyenza
You do, but just a little bit.	Uyayenza, kodwa nje kancinci.
What.	Nini.
There is something wrong with that.	Kukho into engalunganga ngaloo nto.
Mind, yes, but mind, no	Ingqondo, ewe, kodwa ingqondo, hayi

I tried other things	Ndazama ezinye izinto

I want you to go with us.	Ndifuna uhamba nathi.
I can't wait until he comes home	Andikwazi kulinda de agoduke
And thank you for doing this.	Kwaye enkosi ngokwenza oku.
I'm not sure, but maybe.	Andiqinisekanga, kodwa mhlawumbi.
I need to talk to her first	Kufuneka ndithethe naye kuqala
I thought of him scared and alone	Ndacinga ngaye woyika kwaye yedwa
Now she loves attention.	Ngoku uyayithanda ingqalelo.
He finished and just stared.	Wagqiba wajonga nje.
One person made a mistake and this happened	Umntu omnye wenza impazamo kwaye oku kwenzeka
He could not get out.	Akazange akwazi ukuphuma.
That happened to me	Oko kwenzeka kum
It feels very strange.	Uziva engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
Well, that's enough.	Kulungile, ngokwaneleyo oko.
He died as he wished.	Wafa njengoko wayefuna.
I know better.	Ndiyazi ngcono.
Again his eyes did not help.	Kwakhona amehlo akhe akazange ancede.
I think of him that way.	Ndicinga ngaye ngolo hlobo.
I want something.	Ndifuna into.
You probably know more than you think.	Mhlawumbi wazi ngaphezu kokuba ucinga.
He lived in my house.	Wahlala endlini yam.
I'm tired	Ndidiniwe
Probably nothing at all.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto kwaphela.
I just can’t buy one	Andikwazi nje ukuthenga umntu
This goes with him.	Oku kuhamba naye.
I do not remember much	Andikhumbuli kakhulu
However, that is not necessary.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akuyomfuneko.
You know you have succeeded.	Uyazi ukuba uphumelele.
I doubt it will be that long	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba iya kuba lixesha elide kangako
I arrived at the office exhausted	Ndifike eofisini sele ndidiniwe
I have to go to work today	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini namhlanje
I'm sure it's good for him.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ilungile kuye.
There is certainly truth in this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho inyaniso kule nto.
Maybe you will show up.	Mhlawumbi uya kubonakala.
I did nothing else.	Andizange ndenze enye into.
But he did not do any of these.	Kodwa akazange enze nayiphi na.
You play old.	Udlala endala.
I just need your help	Ndifuna nje uncedo lwakho
I wanted to do this for you	Bendifuna ukwenza oku kuwe
I want a gun tonight	Ndifuna umpu ngoku ebusuku
Don't forget about us out here.	Ungalibali ngathi apha phandle.
But we know it to be true.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba yinyani.
I did not want to come here	Bendingafuni ukuza apha
Really, that's exactly what it is.	Ngokwenene, yiloo nto kanye.
I wanted to go with my friends	Ndandifuna ukuhamba nabahlobo bam
I never told anyone at home.	Andizange ndixelele mntu wasekhaya.
He looked around the room.	Wajonga egumbini lonke.
I had to stay in it	Bekufanele ndihlale kuyo
I have to look at something	Kufuneka ndijonge into
I hope dinner will be soon	Ndiyathemba ukuba isidlo sangokuhlwa siza kuba kungekudala
As it happens, this is not so much.	Njengoko kwenzeka, oku akukho kakhulu.

I'm glad to have him here now	Ndiyavuya ngoku ukuba naye apha
I want to see people	Ndifuna ukubona abantu
I think he wants you to do that	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ukuba wenze njalo
He was the first to do so.	Waba ngowokuqala ukwenjenjalo.

That or the word.	Oko okanye ilizwi.
I told him we would do it	Ndamxelela ukuba siza kuyenza
But there is a better way.	Kodwa kukho indlela engcono.
Better, too.	Kungcono, kwakhona.
So thank you again.	Ngoko enkosi kwakhona.
But not everyone.	Kodwa hayi wonke umntu.
You should always try to get the best one.	Kufuneka uhlale uzama ukuya enye engcono.
I think that's a very bad thing	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi kakhulu leyo
I can't walk for days after that	Andikwazi ukuhamba iintsuku emva koko
Or it seemed to me at the time.	Okanye kwakubonakala kum ngelo xesha.
I need to know where you are all the time	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukuba uphi ngalo lonke ixesha
He said something was happening.	Uthe kukho into eyenzekayo.
I spoke to him early today	Ndithethe naye kwangethuba namhlanje

I want to know more about you	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngawe
I came here wanting	Ndize apha ndifuna
I love this place !.	Ndiyayithanda le ndawo!.
And look at this.	Kwaye jonga kule.
I had no idea what was going on with it	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuyo
It happens, but not always.	Kwenzeka, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
It will do you good.	Iya kwenza into elungileyo kuwe.
I don't know if it is or not.	Andazi ukuba yiyo okanye hayi.
I can do it without help, thank you	Ndingayenza ngaphandle koncedo, enkosi
And if you go through this.	Kwaye ukuba uhamba ngale nto.
I do not remember where he lived.	Andikhumbuli ukuba wayehlala phi.
You do not always see it.	Awubonakali njalo.
He lived there all his life.	Wahlala apho ubomi bakhe bonke.
My father, but not my father.	Utata wam, kodwa hayi utata.
Whatever happens to me.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
Nobody ever did this problem.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza ingxaki le.
Home work.	Umsebenzi wasekhaya.

I can't go to school	Andikwazi ukuya esikolweni
I hope you will always check things out	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala ujonge izinto

I thought something bad had happened to you	Bendicinga ukuba kukho into embi eyenzekileyo kuwe

Without you .	Ngaphandle kwakho .
I didn't want to do much with it	Ndandingafuni kwenza nto ingako ngayo
I never thought you were here	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ulapha
But no, he wanted to play with me.	Kodwa hayi, wayefuna ukudlala nam.
It's not just me.	Ayindim kuphela.
It was not enough to do.	Kwakungekho ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
I did not look at what happened after that	Khange ndijonge ukuba kwenzeke ntoni emva koko

I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba ubusazi.

I just want to know everything, right now	Ndifuna nje ukwazi yonke into, ngoku
They went up there.	Baye phaya phezulu.
Not that you will know for a long time.	Akunjalo ukuba uya kukwazi ixesha elide.
He did this for three years.	Oku wakwenza iminyaka emithathu.

It’s not easy, though.	Akukho lula, nangona kunjalo.
I will not wait for your reply	Andisayi kulinda kakhulu impendulo yakho

But he died.	Kodwa wafa.
I would never do such a thing again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndiyenze into enje.
I can't say that now	Andikwazi ukuthetha oko ngoku
You agreed with him.	Wavuma naye.
I knew he would eventually return.	Ndandisazi ukuba ekugqibeleni uya kubuya.
I was hoping he wanted to work with me	Bendinethemba lokuba uyafuna ukusebenza nam
Or just think.	Okanye ucinge nje.
But everyone does.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyayenza.
I don't know, though.	Andazi, nangona kunjalo.
No one needs to talk.	Akukho mntu kufuneka athethe.
About me, this time.	Malunga nam, ngeli xesha.
I have helped people all my life	Ndincede abantu ubomi bam bonke
It will not be so difficult.	Akuyi kuba nzima kangako.
I have to think about both of us.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngathi sobabini.
I want coffee even if you don't want it.	Ndifuna ikofu nokuba awufuni.
I wanted to go faster	Ndandifuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza
But there is no work.	Kodwa akukho msebenzi.
He never went to school.	Akazange aye esikolweni.
I think it is clear that it is not.	Ndicinga ukuba kucacile ukuba akunjalo.
I do not know what to do.	Andazi ukwenza.
I want her to read.	Ndifuna afunde.
I have to tell someone.	Kufuneka ndixelele umntu.
I know about him.	Ndiyazi ngaye.
So this is okay.	Ngoko oku kulungile.
I can't imagine why this happened	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni kwenzeke oku
That obviously is not the case.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I should have stayed with him	Bekufanele ndihlale naye
I want you to stay here and wait	Ndifuna uhlale apha ulinde
They will say yes.	Baza kuthi ewe.
Well, no, not many years.	Ewe, hayi, hayi iminyaka emininzi.
I told him a few weeks	Ndamxelela iiveki ezimbalwa
I can help a lot of people	Ndiyakwazi ukunceda abantu abaninzi
He eats people.	Utya abantu.
He is just like anyone else now.	Ufana naye nabani na ngoku.
Would you like.	Ungathanda.
One does not want to.	Umntu akafuni .
Obviously, it will take time.	Ngokucacileyo, kuya kuthatha ixesha.
He works every day.	Usebenza yonke imihla.
This is our job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wethu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akayi kuba.
I knew he was thinking about it	Ndandisazi ukuba wayecinga ngayo
I just want us to be together.	Ndifuna nje sibe kunye.
Honestly, I was hoping it was, though	Ngenene, bendinethemba lokuba kunjalo, nangona kunjalo
I'm just a little tired	Ndidiniwe nje kancinci
I told her the story	Ndamxelela ibali
Probably nothing.	Inokuba akukho nto.
Not prematurely.	Hayi ngaphambi kwexesha.
I would like to too	Ndingathanda kwakhona
I can't wait for anyone	Andikwazi kulinda mntu
Yes, thank you again.	Ewe, enkosi kwakhona.
That's his way.	Nantso indlela yakhe.
I never did a really good job at that	Andizange ndenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngaloo nto
I should not have gone after you	Bekungafanelanga ndihambe emva kwakho
I didn't see anything or anyone	Andizange ndibone nto okanye nabani na
I can't tell you how long	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ukuba kude kube nini
I just want to work on it, and you will.	Ndifuna nje ukusebenza kuyo, kwaye nawe uya kuyenza.
I've never been there before	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili
Finally he sat down next to me.	Ekugqibeleni wahlala ecaleni kwam.
All, then.	Konke, ngoko.
And what, this is it.	Kwaye yintoni na, yile.
I'm not sure	Andiqinisekanga ncam
He asked me to go with him in the morning.	Uye wandicela ukuba ndihambe naye kusasa.
He just makes that happen.	Uyenza nje ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukwenza oku.
I have to make my own decision.	Kufuneka ndenze isigqibo sam.
I do not know about this problem	Andazi ngale ngxaki
I tried to make my way to it	Ndazama ukwenza indlela yam ukuya kuyo
Your life here.	Ubomi bakho apha.
He is still here.	Ukhona nangoku.
Well you should.	Kulungile ufanele ukuba.
Not so apparently.	Akunjalo kubonakala.
He didn't do it for long.	Akazange ayenze ixesha elide.
I told you everything	Ndikuxelele yonke into
And to really finish it.	Kwaye ukugqiba ngokwenene.
Not just.	Hayi nje .
I know better.	Ndikwazi ngcono.
He did not try.	Akazange azame.
It could be his job too.	Inokuba ngumsebenzi wakhe kwakhona.
Lots of space there.	Indawo eninzi apho.
It will seem to happen faster and faster.	Kuya kubonakala kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
I think you would like.	Ndicinga ukuba ungathanda.
I can't walk properly	Andikwazi kuhamba kakuhle
I was thinking of staying with you here	Bendicinga ukuhlala nawe apha
I can't wait to read this book	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda le ncwadi
With that, everything else will be so much easier!	Ngaloo nto, yonke enye into iya kuba lula kakhulu!
I wonder how you know about it	Ndiyazibuza ukuba wazi njani ngayo
You know better.	Uyazi ngcono.
You will not go that far.	Awuyi kude kangaka.
He left this week.	Wahamba kule veki.
When, he didn't know.	Xa, wayengazi.
But there is one area where this is not the case.	Kodwa kukho indawo enye apho oku akunjalo.
I checked in the morning.	Ndijonge ekuseni.
I could not wait to see what would happen next	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko
But it is better to wait a few days.	Kodwa kungcono ukulinda iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I had to think about it more, later maybe	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngayo ngakumbi, kamva mhlawumbi
He wanted to see what would happen.	Wayefuna ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
She said she loved him.	Wathi uyamthanda.
I will buy it here again	Ndiza kuthenga apha kwakhona
He has been sleeping for days.	Ulele iintsuku.
Maybe you will be able to do it.	Mhlawumbi uya kukwazi ukuyenza.
And so it happened.	Kwaye ke, kwenzeka.
I thought it was okay	Bendicinga ukuba ilungile
I told you there were others.	Ndikuxelele ukuba kukho abanye.
He did not want to be here.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha.
No one knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi ngayo yonke into.
That work must go a long way.	Loo msebenzi kufuneka uye phambili.
At first he was very scared.	Ekuqaleni woyika kakhulu.
We will come back to this later.	Siza kubuya kamva kule nto.
I think a lot about that	Ndicinga kakhulu ngaloo nto
And your friends.	Kwaye nabahlobo bakho.
I think it would be so	Ndicinga ukuba bekuya kuba njalo
I think you will be more successful	Ndicinga ukuba uya kuphumelela ngakumbi
You should have thought of something like that.	Bekufanele ukuba ucinge into enjalo.
But you did not succeed.	Kodwa awuzange uphumelele.
Do your homework there.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho wesikolo apho.
Now it seems we know.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi siyazi.
I want you here soon	Ndifuna ulapha ngokukhawuleza
I don't think there is another.	Andiqondi ukuba kukho enye.
You may be busy today.	Inokuba uxakekile namhlanje.
I was hoping he would like to	Bendinethemba lokuba angathanda
I know you already know that	Ndiyazi ukuba sele uyayazi loo nto
It happened to us.	Kwenzeke kuthi.
Like, just one thing.	Njengokuba, kanye into enye.
I'm sorry about what happened	Ndiyaxolisa ngento eyenzekayo
Absolutely and completely.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwaye ngokupheleleyo.
If you know, then you know.	Ukuba uyazi, ngoko uyazi.
I think it comes with all the money	Ndicinga ukuba iza nayo yonke imali
But he tried hard.	Kodwa wazama kakhulu.
I do not know what this is	Andazi ukuba yintoni le
I didn't look his way	Khange ndijonge indlela yakhe
You made your money.	Wenze imali yakho.
Again, a big deal.	Kwakhona, into enkulu.
It was never about that.	Akuzange kube malunga naloo nto.
I know a lot about this	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngale nto
But the food has been very good lately.	Kodwa ukutya kube kuhle kakhulu mva nje.
Everyone except one.	Wonke umntu ngaphandle komnye.
He was able to do well enough to buy somewhere.	Wakwazi ukwenza kakuhle ngokwaneleyo ukuthenga indawo ethile.
I also heard something recently	Nam ndive into mva nje
But it happens all the time.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
I can’t stop thinking about it.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngayo.
There is no food.	Ukutya akukho.
It should be for everyone !.	Kufuneka ukuba wonke umntu !.
I didn't really want to go out	Bendingafuni nyani ukuphuma
There is no way out of this right now.	Akukho ukuphuma kule nto ngoku.
That happens all the time here.	Oko kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha apha.
Then it will be fine.	Emva koko kuya kuba kuhle.
You will have to do this, though.	Kuya kufuneka wenze oku, nangona kunjalo.
I've been saying this for a long time	Kudala ndithetha le nto
And now he is not like that for her.	Kwaye ngoku akanjalo kuye.
You must have done the right thing.	Umele ukuba wenze into elungileyo.
I am the one you want.	Ndim lo ufuna.
That's about it.	Yiloo nto malunga nayo.
I know my answer	Ndiyayazi impendulo yam
I never went down there	Andizange ndiye apho phantsi
But with everything.	Kodwa ngayo yonke into.
Question.	Umbuzo.
I just want you to think about it	Ndifuna nje ukuba ucinge ngayo
Here, there is no question of doing so.	Apha, akukho mbuzo wokwenza oko.
He was thinking badly.	Wayecinga kakubi.
I just want my money.	Ndifuna nje imali yam.
Some before.	Abanye ngaphambili.
And he loves that way.	Kwaye uyayithanda loo ndlela.
I should not have waited	Bekungafanelanga ndilinde
I knew that was a big deal	Ndandisazi ukuba yinto enkulu leyo
There is no place and no time.	Akukho ndawo kwaye akukho xesha.
Maybe he didn't really want to.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni ngokwenene.
I reached the top.	Ndifike phezulu.
I had to do it again	Kwafuneka ndiyenze kwakhona
I do not want to stay in the house	Andifuni kuhlala apha endlini
I speak very loudly	Ndithetha phezulu kakhulu
I will always tell him.	Ndiza kumxelela njalo.
He went in alone.	Wangena yedwa.
I do not want to be without you again	Andifuni kuphinda ndibe ngaphandle kwakho
And there was nobody for a long, long time.	Kwaye kwakungekho mntu ixesha elide, elide.
I just wanted this done	Bendifuna yenziwe nje lento
Unless he did not.	Ngaphandle kokuba akazange.
But that will end.	Kodwa oko kuza kuphela.
They will be coming to us soon.	Baza kufika kuthi kungekudala.
I know everyone is ready	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ukulungele
But I do not care about age.	Kodwa andikhathali ngeminyaka.
Maybe you're completely gone.	Mhlawumbi uhambe ngokupheleleyo.
And, you can do it.	Kwaye, ungayenza.
I don't think so	Andiqondi ukuba kunjalo
But not me.	Kodwa hayi nam.
He talked more.	Wayethetha ngakumbi.
I did not help there.	Khange ndincede apho.
I never thought of another way to do that.	Andizange ndicinge ngenye indlela yokwenza oko.
Then.	Emva koko .
He wants us to do so.	Ufuna senze njalo.
I can't get enough of it	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo ngayo
Some, yes.	Abanye, ewe.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.

I wanted to say that	Bendifuna ukuyithetha lonto
I decided to read a book	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndifunde incwadi
They both say yes.	Bobabini bathi ewe.
He wanted to tell the truth.	Wayefuna ukuthetha inyani.
The doctor.	Ugqirha .
That's the way he wants it	Nantso indlela afuna ngayo
It is very difficult to do well.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza kakuhle.
It is clear that this will happen.	Kucacile ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
So angry in another way.	Ngoko nomsindo ngenye indlela.
I can't make dinner today	Andikwazi ukwenza isidlo sangokuhlwa namhlanje
Unless they did.	Ngaphandle kokuba abazange.
But other than that, not so much.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko, hayi kakhulu.
I tried to help people	Ndazama ukunceda abantu
Going to college.	Ukuya ekholejini.
I decided to do two	Ndagqiba ukwenza ezimbini
That is even more possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
But again, we didn't go that far.	Kodwa kwakhona, asizange sihambe kangako.
I have to tell my friends	Kufuneka ndixelele abahlobo bam
Give me one thing.	Ndinike into enye.
I can't read his mind	Andikwazi ukufunda ingqondo yakhe
I don't understand anything.	Andiqondi kwanto.
And maybe sooner rather than later.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
I really want to talk to you	Ndifuna kakhulu ukuthetha nawe
I did not tell you.	khange ndikuxelele.
I have long wanted to meet you	Kudala ndifuna ukudibana nawe
But it seems that it will happen.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kuya kwenzeka.

It seems obvious.	Kubonakala ngokucacileyo.
But something.	Kodwa into .
I had no idea there was such a thing	Ndandingazi ukuba kukho into enjalo
I thought, no.	Ndacinga, hayi.
Now, the better you have it.	Ngoku, ngcono nawe unayo.
Probably because it is not necessary.	Mhlawumbi ngenxa yokuba akuyomfuneko.
It will happen one day.	Kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
It could be several weeks.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba iiveki ezininzi.
He did for many days.	Wenza iintsuku ezininzi.
Letter or object	Ileta okanye into
Thank you though.	Enkosi kodwa.

I would like to go there someday	Ndingathanda ukuya khona ngenye imini
I can't talk about it right now	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo okwangoku
He will do nothing about it.	Akayi kwenza nto ngale nto.

I would like to meet him.	Ndingathanda ukudibana naye.
I have seen many things here	Ndibone izinto ezininzi apha

Let me take a look.	Makhe ndijonge.
He has started to do well.	Uye waqalisa ukwenza kakuhle.

I know it can be difficult	Ndiyazi ukuba inokuba nzima
He did not know what the problem was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
I'm not sure why exactly.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kanye kanye.
If you have to do that.	Ukuba kufuneka wenze oko.
This requires work.	Oku kufuna umsebenzi.
You can't talk to him like that.	Awunako ukuthetha naye ngolo hlobo.
To you when needed.	Kuwe xa kufuneka.

I could not say anything.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto.
I don’t know what you really did about him.	Andazi ukuba wenze ntoni ngaye ngokwenene.
Well, she doesn't know what she wants.	Ewe, akayazi into ayifunayo.

And neither did you.	Kwaye nawe awuzange.
You can do that !!.	Ungayenza lonto!!.

But at the same time, nonetheless.	Kodwa ngelo xesha, nangona kunjalo.
Such a beautiful place.	Indawo entle kangaka.
So what's the big deal.	Ngoko yintoni into enkulu.
He went to her side.	Uye ecaleni kwakhe.
If not, it is not.	Ukuba akunjalo, akunjalo.
I think it will happen in the end.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
This will last a few weeks.	Oku kuya kuhlala iiveki ezimbalwa.

But for us, it’s a very good thing.	Kodwa kuthi, yinto entle kakhulu.
I wanted to know what he was doing	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba wenza ntoni
But there is a problem with this.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki kule nto.
This is good for me.	Oku kulungile kum.
I never thought more of that	Andizange ndicinge ngaphezu koko
Yes, they would.	Ewe bekuya kuba njalo.
You have to look forward.	Kufuneka ujonge phambili.
I can't believe he is	Andikholelwa ukuba unjalo
He lived there all his life	Wahlala apho ubomi bakhe bonke
I love a good book	Ndiyayithanda incwadi entle
I haven't told her this yet	Khange ndimxelele lento kodwa
I know you want to play	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukudlala
I will have to go	Kuya kufuneka ndihambe
I'll wait a few days.	Ndiza kulinda iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I've done a good job with this	Ndenze umsebenzi omhle ngale
I can't have children	Andikwazi ukuba nabantwana
Tell me two.	Ndixelele ezimbini.
I had no idea he was	Ndandingazi ukuba unjalo

And you know what it is.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yeyiphi.
There is more here.	Kukho ngakumbi apha.
He's a really good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo ngenene.
But still, it has to be.	Kodwa kunjalo, kufuneka kube njalo.
Thanks again, everyone.	Enkosi kwakhona, wonke umntu.
I know very little.	Ndiyazi kancinci kakhulu.
He got in there very, very well.	Wangena apho kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
I only know in the end.	Ndiyazi kuphela ekugqibeleni.
Not just me, but you.	Hayi mna kuphela, kodwa wena.
He thought he was determined to do something with her.	Wayecinga ukuba uzimisele enye into naye.
I have to look at other things	Kufuneka ndijonge ezinye izinto
Maybe I won't go	Mhlawumbi andisayi kuhamba
This thing again.	Le nto kwakhona.
It's such a little thing.	Yinto encinci enjalo.
And you have to be	Kwaye kufuneka ube njalo
But about it.	Kodwa malunga nayo.
I don't want him to do that	Andifuni ukuba enze njalo
I made my money.	Ndenze imali yam.
That is really good.	Nto leyo ilungile ngokwenene.
I'd like three more now, please.	Ndingathanda ezinye ezintathu ngoku, nceda.
I hope we will see more	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kubona ngakumbi
One has to be.	Omnye kufuneka abe.
And he should have it.	Kwaye kufuneka abe nayo.
Well, something is wrong with you.	Ewe, kukho into engalunganga kuwe.
But, that is not the case.	Kodwa, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
I know you really love her	Ndiyazi ukuba uyamthanda ngokwenene
I do not know how long	Andazi ukuba kude kube nini
I will talk to you every night.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe rhoqo ebusuku.
And only one thing.	Kwaye into enye kuphela.
I really want to know what happened in the end	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ekugqibeleni
I hope it comes soon	Ndiyathemba ukuba iza ngokukhawuleza
I will tell him about you.	Ndiza kumxelela ngawe.
No, there is the same thing.	Hayi, kukho into efanayo.
I doubt you won all night	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uphumelele ubusuku bonke
I stayed here tonight.	Ndihlale apha ubusuku.
I think it's done	Ndicinga ukuba yenziwe
I want to be with you for a long time	Ndifuna ukuba nawe ixesha elide
Good thing to do.	Into elungileyo ukuyenza.
I don't want you to think.	Andifuni ukuba ucinge.
In the future, it is the same.	Ngexesha elizayo, yinto enye.
I think you know where it goes	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi apho iya khona
I thought about him a lot	Ndandicinga ngaye kakhulu
I've never been there before	Andizange ndihambe ndiye apho ngaphambili
Now, we know better.	Ngoku, siyazi ngcono.
I went to his house	Ndaya endlini yakhe
I'm not sure why	Andazi ncam ukuba kutheni
So clearly this is difficult for all of us.	Ngoko ngokucacileyo oku kunzima kuthi sonke.
Maybe we won't get there.	Mhlawumbi asiyi kufika apho.
But nobody seems to be talking about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ubonakala ethetha ngayo.
You know, it's very difficult.	Uyazi, kunzima kakhulu.
So again, it takes a long time.	Ngoko kwakhona, kuthatha ixesha elide.
I knew enough to do my job well	Ndandisazi ngokwaneleyo ukwenza umsebenzi wam kakuhle
But it was not difficult.	Kodwa kwakungekho nzima.
I'm not even sure what exactly	Andiqinisekanga nokuba yintoni kanye kanye
I know about this	Ndiyazi ngale nto
He will leave for a few years.	Uya kuhamba iminyaka embalwa.
I know you wish it were the other way around.	Ndiyazi ukuba unqwenela ukuba kube ngenye indlela.
He tried desperately not to repeat.	Wazama ngamandla ukuba angaphindi.
He knows it and he does not know it.	Uyayazi kwaye akayazi.
The question goes after that.	Umbuzo uhamba emva koko.
I had no idea what that was	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni leyo
Not because of you, it is not.	Akunjalo ngenxa yakho, akunjalo.
Then you learn from me.	Emva koko ufunda kum.
There was not much one.	Kwakungekho mntu kakhulu.
Then you have to go.	Emva koko kufuneka uhambe.
Not mom.	Hayi umama.
I got in front of me a little bit	Ndifike phambi kwam kancinci
I did not see where I was going	Khange ndibone apho ndiya khona
I’m sure someone will go with everything	Ndiqinisekile ukuba umntu uya kuhamba nayo yonke into
You don't want to be with me.	Awufuni ukuba nam.
I've been waiting for you all night	Ndilinde wena ubusuku bonke
I've never been here before	Andizange ndifike apha ngaphambili
It's weird you know.	Yinto engaqhelekanga uyazi.
Better late than later.	Kungcono emva kwexesha kunokuba.
It’s a little more complex.	Yinto encinci ngakumbi.
Right behind him.	Kanye emva kwakhe.
I would love to stay at the party, though	Ndingathanda ukuhlala epatini, nangona kunjalo
This has never happened to him before.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke kuye ngaphambili.
I'm not sure, really	Andiqinisekanga, ngenene
That means one thing and only one thing.	Oko kuthetha into enye kwaye into enye kuphela.
I should not have done this to him.	Akufunekanga ndiyenze lento kuye.
Not the same dog.	Hayi inja efanayo.
Outside not really.	Ngaphandle hayi ngokwenene.
I know you want me all	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna mna konke
As you have done before.	Njengoko ukhe wayenza ngaphambili.
I made a few mistakes	Ndenza iimpazamo ezimbalwa
And it was not easy to walk.	Kwaye kwakungekho lula ukuhamba.
Maybe I did.	Mhlawumbi ndenze njalo.
This is really good.	Oku kulungile ngokwenene.
We know this is impossible.	Siyazi ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
I wish her doctor knew	Akwaba ugqirha wakhe wayesazi
Every little talk.	Yonke intetho encinci.
She's not happy.	Uyavuya akunjalo.
I thought something big was happening	Ndandicinga ukuba kukho into enkulu eyenzekayo
That will be evident.	Oko kuya kubonakala.
See if you do a good job or not.	Jonga ukuba wenze umsebenzi olungileyo okanye hayi.
But he could not, for he was late.	Kodwa akazange akwazi, kuba wafika emva kwexesha.
I thought he was doing very well	Ndandicinga ukuba uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu
No, no, really.	Hayi, hayi, ngenene.
Then again and again.	Emva koko kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I think that's a good thing to do	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka.
I'll tell her soon	Ndiza kumxelela kungekudala
I haven't seen him very much lately	Khange ndimbone kakhulu mva nje
I think we should do that right away	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono senze oko kwangoko
But it takes money to do that.	Kodwa kufuneka imali ukwenza oko.
And this will be the case.	Kwaye oku kuya kuba njalo.
No, he did.	Hayi, uyenzile.
He didn't want to though.	Wayengafuni nangona kunjalo.
I don't remember you saying that.	Andikhumbuli uthetha lonto.
And no one talked about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu wathetha ngayo.
I have asked for my way here.	Ndiye ndacela indlela yam apha.
I am a new person.	Ndingumntu omtsha.
People there.	Abantu apho.
I have to talk to him about something	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngento ethile
I'm talking about myself now.	Ndithetha ngam ngoku.
I wanted to go regularly	Ndandifuna ukuya rhoqo
I hope that happens soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Or it may be difficult.	Okanye inokuba nzima.
But you will definitely be able to meet him again.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uya kukwazi ukudibana naye kwakhona.
To work.	Ukusebenza.
I will make it happen	Ndiya kuyenza yenzeke
It would be up to you.	Bekuya kuwe.
Only we did not.	Kuphela asizange senze.
I know it's a child	Ndiyazi ukuba ngumntwana
But he did very well with this song.	Kodwa wenza kakuhle kakhulu ngale ngoma.
But one mistake did not happen.	Kodwa enye impazamo ayizange yenzeke.
I know he is there	Ndiyamazi ukuba ukhona
No matter what that means.	Nokuba oko kuthetha ntoni na.
I try to stay with him	Ndizama ukuhlala naye
I just wanted time to be alone	Bendifuna nje ixesha lokuba ndedwa
I just want him to agree	Ndifuna nje ukuba avume
I want you to stay here for now	Ndifuna ukuba uhlale apha okwangoku
I can do it though.	Ndingayenza kodwa.
Nothing at first.	Akukho nto ekuqaleni.
I've always thought of you.	Bendisoloko ndicinga ngawe.
This, however, does not have to be the case.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akufuneki ukuba kube njalo.
I know what a house is	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni na indlu
I told her the opportunity	Ndimxelele ithuba
I just want to do my job	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam
Yes, no thank you.	Ewe, hayi enkosi.

I apologize again.	Ndicela uxolo kwakhona.
I can do it a lot of the time	Ndingayenza ixesha elininzi
And much more than you want.	Kwaye okuninzi ngakumbi kunokuba ufuna.
All but you.	Konke ngaphandle kwakho.
I think he is a good man	Ndicinga ukuba yindoda elungileyo
I did not tell you the whole truth.	Andizange ndikuxelele yonke inyani.
I can't talk to you right now	Andikwazi kuthetha nawe ngoku
He doesn't like it.	Akayithandi.
That's really good.	Oko kuhle ngokwenene.
No one wanted to know	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi
You study at work.	Ufunda emsebenzini.
But it happens every day.	Kodwa kwenzeka yonke imihla.
I read a little yesterday	Ndifunde kancinci izolo
You know they will be there.	Uyazi ukuba baya kuba phaya.
Well, well, thank you for this.	Kulungile, ke, enkosi ngale nto.
I saw everything.	Ndabona yonke into.

I didn’t want to sing all night, of course	Ndandingafuni ukucula ubusuku bonke, kunjalo
Although now.	Nangona ngoku.
Thanks again and again !!!.	Enkosi kwakhona kwaye kwakhona !!!.

I thought it was impossible	Ndandicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka
Anyway, of course.	Nangona kunjalo, kunjalo.
I thought you knew it by now	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi ngoku

I can't stay long, though	Andikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo
But nobody said you can't do this.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthe awukwazi ukuyenza le nto.
I decided to have a party.	Ndagqiba ekubeni senze itheko.
If he does not want to.	Ukuba akafuni.
The sooner, the better.	Ngokukhawuleza, kungcono.
And you will see a lot more in us.	Kwaye uza kubona okuninzi ngakumbi kuthi.
He went out and took everything with him.	Waphuma wahamba nayo yonke into.
I have done some work for him now	Ndenze omnye umsebenzi kuye ngoku
There is a doctor at home when needed.	Kukho ugqirha ekhaya xa kufuneka.
And not far away.	Kwaye hayi kude.
I'll stay all night	Ndiza kuhlala ubusuku bonke
And in everything else.	Kwaye kuyo yonke enye into.

I heard music in the background	Ndeva umculo ngasemva
You know what happens next.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Not just meeting him once.	Hayi nje ukudibana naye kanye.
I went with her to school	Ndaya naye esikolweni
I don't like it for years.	Andikuthandi iminyaka.
You'll see why, soon.	Uya kubona ukuba kutheni, kungekudala.
I just wanted money	Bendifuna nje imali
That was obvious.	Oko kwakubonakala.
What did he do though.	Wenza ntoni kodwa.
Well people there.	Abantu kakuhle apho.
But he knows nothing.	Kodwa akazi nto.
In the end, we will succeed.	Ekugqibeleni, siza kuphumelela.
I'm sure you know which one	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi ukuba yeyiphi
In my room.	Kwigumbi lam.
This is exactly the case.	Oku kunjalo kunjalo.
I can't imagine what happened the other day	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na ngenye imini
I am waiting for you to come.	Ndilinde ndize kuwe.
Would you like to know.	Ungathanda ukwazi.

You've been out of here.	Ukhe waphuma apha.
And not so fast.	Kwaye hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I'm glad she's here	Ndiyavuya elapha
He did this many times.	Wakwenza oku izihlandlo ezininzi.
I hope.	Ndiyathemba.

I do this all the time	Ndiyenza le nto ngalo lonke ixesha
I never thought of anything	Andizange ndicinge ngayo nayiphi na into

But one went.	Kodwa omnye uye.
He did not know what would happen to him.	Wayengazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
I have not thought about it until now	Khange ndicinge ngayo de kube ngoku
Maybe just like you.	Mhlawumbi njengawe.
I should have done that	Bekufanele ndiyenze loo nto
There is.	Kukho.
I can imagine that it is not easy to do that	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga ukuba akukho lula ukwenza oko
But that's about that.	Kodwa oko malunga nokuba.
He knows he has to go.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
Sure enough, he thought.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wacinga.
New book.	Incwadi entsha.
He can't do this.	Akanakuyenza le nto.
Then there is no money.	Emva koko akukho mali.
He stays with us here every day.	Uhleli nathi apha yonke imihla.
I can't wait for your party	Andikwazi ukulinda itheko lakho
No letter at all.	Akukho ileta kwaphela.
And there is truth in that.	Kwaye kukho inyaniso kuloo nto.
I can't think of anything to do.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngento yokwenza.
You’re lucky, by the way.	Unethamsanqa, ngendlela.
I didn't want to get out of there	Ndandingafuni ukuphuma apho
Or if they will.	Okanye ukuba baya kwenza.
And at first he did not.	Kwaye ekuqaleni akazange.
I never looked forward to it, any of it.	Khange ndijonge phambili kuyo, nayiphi na kuyo.
That would be a big deal.	Oko bekuya kuba yinto enkulu.
And we are not.	Kwaye asiyi.
And in this case, it is clearly not the case.	Kwaye kule meko, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
But he knew enough.	Kodwa wayesazi ngokwaneleyo.
I hope it didn't hurt you or anything	Ndiyathemba ukuba khange akwenze buhlungu okanye nantoni na
I forgot you left yesterday	Ndilibele ukuba uhambe izolo
I would like to try this.	Ndingathanda ukuzama oku.
My job.	Umsebenzi wam.
It is impossible for anyone to do that.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba umntu akwenze oko.
I don't know anyone.	Andazi nabani na.
Then he would take his place.	Emva koko wayeza kuthatha indawo yakhe.
Now we know that you know everything.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba wazi yonke into.
Sitting in a classroom becomes difficult.	Ukuhlala eklasini kuba nzima.

I don't want you to think about me	Andifuni ukuba ucinge ngam

After that, he did not.	Emva koko, akazange.
I have to make a speech	Kufuneka ndenze intetho
I will definitely be back soon	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya kungekudala
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngoko.
He looked good in it.	Wayekhangeleka kakuhle kuyo.
Here, look at this.	Apha, jonga oku.
No matter how successful you are.	Nokuba uphumelele kangakanani na.

You do not have to come here.	Akufunekanga uze apha.
I never knew why	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kutheni
I had no idea what he was talking about	Bendingayazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni

He asked quickly.	Wabuza ngokukhawuleza.

Then it will be more.	Emva koko iya kuba ngakumbi.
I wanted to get out of there.	Bendifuna ukuphuma apho.
I can do something else.	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza enye into.
I hope all goes well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle.
We didn't do much about it.	Asizange senze nto ingako ngayo.

You should expect this.	Kufuneka ulindele oku.
You know that about me.	Uyayazi lonto ngam.

I will definitely come back again and again	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya kwakhona kwaye kwakhona

I know he felt it too	Ndiyazi naye waziva
Maybe I'll never see him again.	Mhlawumbi andisayi kuphinda ndimbone.

We need to do more here.	Kufuneka senze okuninzi apha.
He did not say anything else.	Akazange athethe enye into.

But that is even harder.	Kodwa oko kunzima ngakumbi.
I just want to help	Ndifuna ukunceda kuphela
You feel very bad about this.	Uziva kakubi kakhulu ngale nto.

I need to talk to you this morning	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe ngale ntsasa

I can't wait to do it again	Andikwazi kulinda ukuyenza kwakhona
So, it could be very.	Ngoko ke, inokuba kakhulu.

There is much more to it.	Kukho okuninzi ngakumbi kuyo.
I'll talk to you tomorrow night	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngomso ebusuku
I have to do it alone	Kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa
We will go there.	Siza kuhamba apho.
Thank you very much, everyone.	Enkosi kakhulu, wonke umntu.
I did the same thing.	Ndenza into efanayo.
But that is not always the case.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo loo nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
I would absolutely love it.	Ndingathanda ngokupheleleyo.
I never thought about it, you know	Andizange ndicinge ngayo, uyazi
Other than that, it's okay.	Ngaphandle koko, ilungile.
Man, long ago.	Mntu, kudala.
But we did not have to go far	Kodwa kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba siye kude kakhulu
You expect the best for you.	Ulindele ukuphumelela ngamandla.
Not a big man.	Hayi umntu omkhulu.
I never learned much	Andizange ndifunde kangako
But now something unusual happened next.	Kodwa ngoku kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He agreed.	Naye wavuma.
Today that person is me.	Namhlanje ukuba umntu ndim.
I did not want to	Ndandingafuni
And not so again.	Kwaye akunjalo kwakhona.
This is not the case.	Akunjalo oku.
I told her something today	Ndimxelele into namhlanje
You know, look at a lot of people.	Uyazi, jonga abantu abaninzi.
Check you.	Jonga wena.
How this happened last night.	Hayi indlela oku kwenzeke ngayo phezolo.
I'll talk to him about it.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngayo.
I want him to do it again.	Ndifuna ukuba aphinde ayenze loo nto.
But do not stop your study there.	Kodwa musa ukuyeka ukufunda kwakho apho.
I had no idea what to expect	Bendingayazi ukuba ulindele ntoni
Right there in front of him.	Kanye apho phambi kwakhe.
I had to do it myself.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze ngokwam.
Or his room.	Okanye igumbi lakhe.
I did not know why until now	Bendingazi ukuba kutheni kude kube ngoku
Finally he finished.	Ekugqibeleni wagqiba.
I knew she was right	Ndandisazi ukuba uthetha inyani
She had to think about him.	Kwafuneka acinge ngaye.
Not so much, now and again.	Hayi kakhulu, ngoku kwaye kwakhona.
I will not, not a little	Andiyi, hayi kancinci
I make coffee.	Ndenza ikofu.
I want to tell you something	Ndifuna ukukuxelela into
I thought you might like to know	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda ukwazi
I live.	Nzima.
Nobody knew about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngaloo nto.
I thought that was obvious	Ndandicinga ukuba oko kucacile
I didn't have to go.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ndihambe.
I can do it.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza.
Not too far away.	Akukho kude kangako.
What else?.	Yintoni enye?.
Later, he fell asleep.	Kamva, walala.
I could not talk to him about this	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha naye ngale nto
Nobody did a great thing with it.	Akukho mntu wenza into enkulu ngayo.
I don't know what's going on here.	Andazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
He didn't say anything at school.	Khange athethe nto esikolweni.
It's all true, you know.	Yonke yinyani, uyazi.
Working on it.	Ukusebenza kuyo.
I only came to say it	Ndize kuthetha yona kuphela
I don't think he will do it, though.	Andiqondi ukuba uya kuyenza, nangona kunjalo.
I live alone now	Ndihlala ndedwa ngoku
I did not want her to know	Ndandingafuni ukuba azi
It would be nice to do it again.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuyenza kwakhona.
I knew he was going to leave	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuhamba
I'm really talking to her	Ngenene ndithetha naye
He read well.	Wafunda kakuhle.
Whether tonight or tomorrow.	Nokuba ngokuhlwanje okanye ngomso.
Well, it seems like it could be a very good thing.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi inokuba yinto entle kakhulu.
Then I thought about it	Ndiye ndacinga ngayo
He knew exactly who he was looking for.	Wayesazi kakuhle ukuba ufuna bani.
I know how strange it is.	Ndiyayazi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo.
I will not say anything about us	Andiyi kuthetha nto ngathi
I should not have said that	Akufunekanga ndithethe ngolo hlobo
I'll tell you again	Ndiza kuphinda ndikuxelele
I want to know what you told the police	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba uxelele amapolisa ntoni
I will not be tomorrow.	Andisayi kuba ngomso.
I don’t see where I made the mistake.	Andiboni apho ndenza khona impazamo.
Great way.	Indlela enkulu.
I didn't really know it	Khange ndikwazi ncam kuyo
We want to learn more about him.	Sifuna ukufunda ngakumbi ngaye.
I just know you are good at it	Ndiyazi nje ukuba ulungile kuyo
It will come soon, and it will last.	Iza kwangethuba, kwaye iza kuhlala.
So, he went out and did just that.	Ngoko, waphuma waza wenza kanye loo nto.
I would like you to tell me.	Ndingathanda undixelele.
A little earlier.	Kancinci ngaphambili.
But this is really good.	Kodwa oku kulungile ngokwenene.
I don't want to go!	Andifuni ukuhamba!
Just how hard it is to say.	Kanye ukuba kunzima kangakanani ukuthetha.
However, doing things quickly will not work.	Nangona kunjalo, ukwenza izinto ngokukhawuleza akuyi kwenza.
I heard his voice last night	Ndive ilizwi lakhe phezolo
Now, you will do it now.	Ngoku, uya kwenza ngoku.
It was not long before.	Akuzange kube kudala.
I thought you might have it	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba unayo
And with him.	Kwaye kunye naye.
Now you are fine.	Ngoku ulungile.
Not back here.	Hayi emva apha.
Nobody ever got down there.	Akukho mntu ukhe wehla apho.
We were never really here.	Asizange sibe lapha ngokwenene.
I know that, my mistake.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, impazamo yam.
I have to think a little bit	Kufuneka ndicinge kancinci
Not to you, or to him.	Hayi kuwe, okanye kuye.
I want to know one thing	Ndifuna ukwazi into enye
You need to know more.	Kufuneka wazi ngakumbi.
The truth is, no one knows.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho mntu uyazi.
I wanted something from him.	Ndandifuna into kuye.
That is not the way it is.	Ayisiyiyo indlela leyo.
You have to do as you feel.	Kufuneka wenze njengoko uziva.
I didn't think of anything	Khange ndicinge nto
Not beyond.	Hayi ngale.
And he wondered how this could happen.	Kwaye wazibuza ukuba kunokwenzeka njani oku.
And he said nothing.	Kwaye akazange athethe nto.
I want to know more about this situation	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngale meko
I can't wait until he gets older	Andikwazi kulinda de abe mdala
You know about me.	Uyayazi ngam.
Or as.	Okanye njengoko.
Well enough, he thought.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, wacinga.
It wasn't him.	Yayingenguye ewe.
Nobody says anything about it	Akukho mntu uthi nto ngaloo nto
And he never told me about it.	Kwaye akazange andixelele ngayo.
I'm sure you can	Ndiqinisekile ungayenza
Nothing happened at my end.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo ekugqibeleni kwam.
But we know better.	Kodwa siyazi ngcono.
Nothing, maybe.	Akukho nto, mhlawumbi.
You have to stay with it and stay positive.	Kufuneka uhlale nayo kwaye uhlale unethemba.
Everyone is coming here.	Wonke umntu uza apha.
I knew one thing for sure	Ndandisazi into enye ngokuqinisekileyo
I think that's right.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile loo nto.
I will be true to you	Ndiya kuba yinyani kuwe
You have a place at home.	Unayo indawo ekhaya.
I know, but the question is why	Ndiyazi, kodwa umbuzo kukuba kutheni
I wanted to be ahead.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngaphambili.
I hope you like it here	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda apha
I made breakfast	Ndenze isidlo sakusasa
I need to talk to her right away	Kufuneka ndithethe naye kwangoko
Thank you, no thank you.	Enkosi, hayi enkosi.
I didn’t do that, though.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto, nangona kunjalo.
I think you should talk to him.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uthethe naye .
I'll be there soon	Ndiza kufika khona kungekudala
I think he was scared	Ndicinga ukuba wayesoyika
I'm going to his office now.	Ndiya eofisini yakhe ngoku.
I won't talk to you about that again, then	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe nawe ngaloo nto, ngoko
I wanted to do the right thing	Ndandifuna ukwenza into elungileyo
He left his room.	Waphuma egumbini lakhe.
Another place.	Enye indawo.
Not too little.	Hayi kancinci kakhulu.
I knew it wouldn't happen	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo
I did not want to go in the same direction	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba ngendlela efanayo
Something else is going to happen.	Kukho enye into eza kwenzeka.
No, he did not.	Hayi, wayengafuni.
For hours, you will.	Iiyure, uya kwenza.
Food is very difficult.	Ukutya kunzima kakhulu.
Again, it goes on for hours.	Kwakhona, kuqhubeka iiyure.
People will come.	Abantu baya kuza.
I have to stay with you here	Kufuneka ndihlale nawe apha
I can't do all this on my own	Andikwazi ukwenza konke oku ngokwam
Nothing, to say the least.	Akukho nto, ukuthetha.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, kunjalo ngokwenene.
Just one new person.	Umntu omtsha nje omnye.
I didn’t see anything about what was wrong with him.	Andizange ndibone nto malunga nokuba yintoni engalunganga kuye.
I looked up.	Ndijonge phezulu.
No, there is no way.	Hayi, akukho ndlela.
Well, maybe.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi.
I didn't know what it was, but there was something wrong with it	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni, kodwa kukho into engalunganga apha
We have done it for years.	Senze iminyaka.
He did that a lot tonight.	Wenza loo nto kakhulu ngokuhlwanje.
I look forward a little	Ndijonge phambili kancinci
I did not want that to happen	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke loo nto
One has to do something with him now.	Umntu kufuneka enze into naye ngoku.
I want to know if he will come back	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba uya kubuya
If not, then it is not.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngoko akunjalo.
Everything in one place.	Yonke into kwindawo enye.
I wonder what is going on with him	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni ngaye
and all that.	nayo yonke loo nto.
He did not know many.	Wayengazi abaninzi.
It will be in the background.	Iya kuba ngasemva.
I feel bad for him	Ndiziva kakubi ngaye
I mean every day	Ndithetha ukuba yonke imihla
I will always try something new	Ndiya kuhlala ndizama into entsha
And only there.	Kwaye kuphela apho.
You too.	Nawe.
However, it could be.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokuba.
I couldn't wait to get out of there	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuphuma apho
I'm here all the time.	Ndilapha ngalo lonke ixesha.
So I need help.	Ngoko ndifuna uncedo.
So much every day.	Kakhulu yonke imihla.
But that is possible.	Kodwa oko kunokwenzeka.
And like me it won't be much better.	Kwaye njengam akuyi kuba ngcono kakhulu.
I thought you had it	Bendicinga ukuba unayo
I want to take my wife with me	Ndifuna ukuthatha umfazi wam ahambe nam
He is there though.	Ukhona nangona kunjalo.
I can't, of course.	Andikwazi, kunjalo.
However, he is not here.	Kodwa ke, akakho apha.
I don't know about this	Andazi ngale nto
I thought everyone knew that.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.

I will have to go to school	Kuya kufuneka ndiye esikolweni
And a good wife.	Kwaye umfazi olungileyo.

However, his car is needed.	Kodwa ke, kufuneka imoto yakhe.

I just wanted to talk to him	Ndandifuna nje ukuthetha naye
Tell me there is a better way.	Ndixelele ukuba kukho indlela engcono.
It seemed too far away.	Kwakubonakala kude kakhulu.
There is something after that.	Kukho into emva koko.
It is impossible for him to have his time now.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba abe nexesha lakhe ngoku.
Then we have to go.	Emva koko kufuneka sihambe.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje, mhlawumbi hayi ngomso.
I mean that's a good thing.	Ndithetha ukuba yinto entle.
Please take a look !!!.	Nceda ujonge !!!.
I can't see, I can't see or I can't see very well.	Andiboni, andiboni okanye andiboni kakuhle.
I don't want to do it that way.	Andifuni ukuyenza ngolo hlobo.
I want, or I want, sorry	Ndifuna, okanye ndifuna, uxolo
I did not want her to know the truth	Ndandingafuni ukuba azi inyaniso
He looked, but again there was nothing.	Wajonga, kodwa kwakhona kwakungekho nto.
I can't do it this way.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngolu hlobo.
After a long time he spoke.	Emva kwexesha elide wathetha.

He went to college.	Uye waya ekholejini.
I saw no other way	Andizange ndibone enye indlela
I know because he told me so	Ndiyazi kuba wandixelela njalo
I can't tell you about it	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ngayo
And how that happened, no one really knows.	Kwaye ukuba kwenzeka njani, akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He sat down for his breakfast.	Wahlala phantsi kwisidlo sakusasa sakhe.
He would tell her that.	Wayeza kumxelela loo nto.
We will call the house.	Siza kuthi indlu.
I wanted him to do something, say something	Bendifuna enze into, athethe into
So very, very bad.	Ngoko kakhulu, kakubi kakhulu.

I couldn't help but think of that	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ndicinga lonto

I'm just one person	Ndingumntu nje omnye
I spoke to him early.	Ndithethe naye kwangethuba.
I came to talk to you here	Ndize kuthetha nawe apha
Yes it is very good.	Ewe kuhle kakhulu.
I didn't want to do this	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza le nto
This requires intelligence.	Oku kufuna ingqondo.
I did not want to die like that	Ndandingafuni ukufa ngolo hlobo
And he did this.	Kwaye oku wakwenza.
But it looks really good.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile ngokwenene.
However, it seems that it will be painful.	Nangona kunjalo, kubonakala ngathi kuya kuba buhlungu.
I did not know why at that time	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni ngelo xesha
Sorry, but you have to go.	Uxolo, kodwa kufuneka uhambe.
Just talking about me more.	Ukuthetha nje ngam ngakumbi.
Another bad thing.	Enye into embi.
Please come with me.	Ndicela uhambe nam.
He never was.	Akazange abe njalo.
I just want to know the truth	Ndifuna nje ukwazi inyaniso
This, of course, is not the case.	Oku, kunjalo, akunjalo.
Unless he was absent.	Ngaphandle kokuba wayengekho.
He may have known.	Usenokuba wayesazi.
Not everyone, but some will.	Ayinguye wonke umntu, kodwa abanye baya kuyenza.
So it takes a few weeks.	Ngoko kuthatha iiveki ezimbalwa.
I could not have succeeded without you.	Andikwazanga ukuphumelela ngaphandle kwakho.
I would love to win	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuphumelela
It took a few days.	Wathatha iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I can do a lot.	Ndingayenza kakhulu.
And he was afraid.	Woyika ke.
Definitely very fast.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I look again.	Ndiphinde ndijonge.
I wanted to be him	Ndandifuna ukuba nguye
We will do everything.	Siya kwenza yonke into.
It just takes a long time to do.	Kuthatha nje ixesha elide ukwenza.
And he will be with us.	Kwaye uya kuba nathi.
And do some more.	Kwaye wenze ezinye ngakumbi.
I didn't say anything, of course.	Khange ndithethe nto, kunjalo.
And he can't do it in my car.	Kwaye akanakuyenza emotweni yam.
He said yes, that's right.	Uthe ewe, kunjalo.
And it's very good	Kwaye kuhle kakhulu
I didn't want to see anything	Ndandingafuni ukubona nto
There is another phone. 	Kukho enye ifowuni. 
I thought about that later	Ndacinga ngaloo nto kamva
You will be able to go home.	Uya kukwazi ukuya ekhaya.
And you will succeed.	Kwaye uya kuphumelela.
The only problem is that he could not do it himself.	Ingxaki kuphela kukuba akazange akwazi ukuyenza ngokwakhe.
He seems to be the only one.	Kubonakala ngathi nguye yedwa.
He has entered.	Uye wangena.
I can't say more than that right now	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngaphezu koko ngoku
Maybe something happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho into eyenzekileyo.
He arrived very quickly.	Wafika ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I would love to be there	Ndingathanda kakhulu apho
She is really scared.	Woyika ngokwenene.
I did not know why then	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni ngoko
But in a good way.	Kodwa ngendlela elungileyo.
Such questions.	Imibuzo enjalo.
I just want time alone	Ndifuna nje ixesha ndedwa
I look forward to meeting you	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana nawe
As you should know.	Njengoko kufuneka uyazi.
Not really fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
They sit down though.	Bahlala phantsi nangona kunjalo.
If any.	Ukuba kukho.
I don't know anything about his friends right now	Andazi nto malunga nabahlobo bakhe ngoku
I wanted to eat alone today	Bendifuna ukutya ndedwa namhlanje
If not, whatever.	Ukuba akunjalo, nantoni na.
But no one knew too much.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi kakhulu.
Really, really late.	Ngokwenene, emva kwexesha ngenene.
What he did not want.	Oko wayengafuni.
I think this is for me	Ndicinga ukuba oku kum
I just wanted to see what would happen	Ndandifuna nje ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni
He was absent for three years.	Wayengekho iminyaka emithathu.
I wanted more than anything else	Ndandifuna izinto ezininzi ngaphandle kokuba ndedwa
But all good time.	Kodwa lonke ixesha elihle.
Because it takes a long time to do something new.	Kuba kuthatha ixesha elide ukwenza into entsha.
You know something.	Uyayazi into.

And so on.	Kwaye ke ngoko.
I think he knows more than he does	Ndicinga ukuba wazi ngaphezu kokuba ethetha
Good thing though.	Into entle kunjalo.
He just wanted time, he finished.	Wayefuna nje ixesha, wagqiba.
It’s just a small thing, really	Yinto nje encinci, ngokwenene
Things in a long room.	Izinto kwigumbi elide.
And now it means a lot more.	Kwaye ngoku kuthetha okuninzi kakhulu.
It's the same thing over and over again.	Yinto enye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I'm sure you're right.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ulungile.
But this one.	Kodwa lo.
And it will be good.	Kwaye kuya kuba kuhle.
He is, he is.	Nguye, nguye.
I went to that right away	Ndaya kuloo nto ngoko nangoko
But you didn't and you can't.	Kodwa awuzange kwaye awukwazi.
I think there are a few.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho ezimbalwa.
You must be here.	Kumele ukuba ulapha.
But he must do so.	Kodwa kufuneka enjenjalo.
You did a good job there, though.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle phaya, nangona kunjalo.
I think he did	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo
Yes, not always.	Ewe, hayi rhoqo.
Just my reading.	Nje ukufunda kwam.
He did not help her.	Akazange amncede.
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba le yinto elungileyo okanye hayi.
He is determined to do it.	Uzimisele ukuyenza.
And he lives here.	Kwaye uhlala apha.
You read all the time.	Ufunda ngalo lonke ixesha.
I did not speak to you	khange ndithethe nawe
He thinks it is true.	Ucinga ukuba yinyani.
I saw something wrong	Ndabona into embi
I want to find one way or the other	Ndifuna ukufumana indlela enye okanye enye
I wanted to run something for you	Bendifuna ukuqhuba into ngawe

I never thought it would be that hard	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba nzima ngolo hlobo ngokwenene
I really want to do that.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza loo nto.
But that did not happen to us.	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke kuthi.
And it looks good.	Kwaye kubonakala kulungile.
I'm looking at this	Ndijonge le nto
The answer is yes.	Impendulo yile.
He is a strange man.	Yindoda engaqhelekanga.
You know, you should know too.	Uyazi, nawe ufanele ukwazi.
I wanted to make my time	Ndandifuna ukwenza ixesha lam
And maybe make money with it.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ukwenza imali ngayo.
But I told you what.	Kodwa ndikuxelele ntoni.
Please !!!,!,!.	Nceda !!!,!,!.
Only a small amount of money is required.	Kufuneka imali encinci kuphela.
I will not be too far away	Andiyi kuba kude kakhulu
He did not want to talk.	Akazange afune ukuthetha.
I want to be your friend right now	Ndifuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakho okwangoku
In the morning, after his afternoon.	Ekuseni, emva kwemini yakhe.

I want to know everything that happens	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into eyenzekayo

I think it is not too difficult to find an answer.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho nzima kakhulu ukufumana impendulo.
I feel a little tired	Ndiziva ndidiniwe kancinci
This is reflected in the bedroom.	Oku kubonakala kwigumbi lokulala.
And he wants to.	Kwaye uyafuna.
I never thought of you	Khange ndicinge ngawe
That should not be too difficult.	Oko akufanele kube nzima kangako.
You know it's true.	Uyayazi ukuba yinyani.
I don't think it will ever happen	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuze kwenzeke
My mother was terrified.	Umama wayesoyika.
A lot can happen.	Kunokwenzeka okuninzi.
This is another thing, no.	Le enye into, hayi.
I'm not sure you did.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
My father did just that.	Utata wenza njalo.
Well, now we know.	Ewe, ngoku siyazi.
I think the window is ready for now	Ndicinga ukuba ifestile ilungile okwangoku
Or maybe he knew.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayesazi.

He will not be able to get out.	Akayi kukwazi ukuphuma.
He is and I am.	Nguye kwaye ndim.
I know you like it.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda.
I don't think he knew anything.	Andiqondi ukuba wayesazi nto.
A car is a thing.	Imoto yinto.
I think this looks good	Ndicinga ukuba oku kubonakala kulungile
I had no idea where he lived, how.	Ndandingazi ukuba uhlala phi, njani.

Some truth to that, you know.	Enye inyaniso kuloo nto, uyazi.
I know you can do this	Ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza le nto
However, that is clearly not possible.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akunakwenzeka ngokucacileyo.
When he is here.	Xa elapha.
Not for the faint of heart.	Hayi ngento engalunganga kuye.
I really want to try	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuzama
But he learned quickly.	Kodwa wafunda ngokukhawuleza.
He thought it might be the person	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguye loo mntu
That's more.	Oko ngakumbi.
I can't say much more about that	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngakumbi malunga naloo nto
Why did you come.	Kwakutheni uze.
I had no idea how she was going to do that	Ndandingazi ukuba uza kuyenza njani loo nto
There is a way.	Kukho indlela.
I will do this regularly for sure, thank you !.	Ndiya kwenza ezi rhoqo ngokuqinisekileyo, enkosi!.

You can get out.	Uyakwazi ukuphuma.

I will be easy on him	Ndiya kuba lula kuye
He wants you to do something else.	Ufuna ukuba wenze enye into.
Maybe he comes home tomorrow afternoon.	Mhlawumbi uza ekhaya ngomso emva kwemini.
Look at your dog.	Jonga inja yakho.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke into.
I just want to do this	Ndifuna nje ukuyenza le nto
Not outside but inside.	Hayi ngaphandle kodwa ngaphakathi.
I'll take some.	Ndiza kuthatha ezinye.
He doesn't want to talk to you.	Akafuni kuthetha nawe.
Or.	Okanye.
If so how ?.	Ukuba kunjalo njani?.
You want to learn, okay.	Ufuna ukufunda, kulungile.
We better do it that way.	Kungcono siyenze ngolo hlobo.
Really, nothing happened.	Ngokwenene, akukho nto eyenzekayo.
I mean	Ndithetha nje
It's you and me, now.	Nguwe kunye nam, ngoku.
I can succeed	Ndiyakwazi ukuphumelela

We want something else.	Sifuna enye into.
I do not see much.	Andiboni kakhulu.

I had no idea they were going to do that	Ndandingazi ukuba baza kuyenza loo nto
How, too.	Indlela, nayo.

I want to go with it	Ndifuna ukuhamba nayo
It will take as long as it takes.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha elide njengoko kuthatha.
I know that too.	Nam ndiyayazi lonto.
He thought he was doing well.	Wayecinga ukuba uqhuba kakuhle.
I'm not sure where they are going	Andiqinisekanga apho baya khona
But no one really knew what it was.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
I know it's good for me	Ndiyazi ukuba kulungile kum
That's the way he wants to work with me.	Yiloo ndlela afuna ukusebenza ngayo nam.
I went to it to look further.	Ndaya kuyo ukuze ndijonge ngakumbi.
That seems like a plan.	Kubonakala ngathi licebo elo.
But early in the day.	Kodwa ekuqaleni kwemini.
If you can't do that, then.	Ukuba awukwazi ukwenza oko, ngoko.
I want to see what you are wearing	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba unxibe ntoni

To do all the work.	Ukwenza wonke umsebenzi.

And so it happened.	Kwaye kunjalo, kwenzeka.
I said nothing about it	Andizange ndithethe nto ngayo
I couldn’t wait to get out of it	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuphuma kuyo
You saw your mother.	Wabona umama wakho.

I never heard of it again	Andizange ndiphinde ndive ngayo
You seem to be a good person.	Ubonakala ungumntu olungileyo.
I want to know what the problem is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Yeah, not clear enough.	Ewe, hayi ngokucacileyo ngokwaneleyo.
I knew he was very smart	Ndandisazi ukuba ukrelekrele kakhulu
I will never talk about it again today.	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe ngayo namhlanje.
That's all.	Kuphela oko kanye.
Tell me more about this.	Ndixelele ngakumbi ngale nto.
I gave up everything and tried everything else	Ndinike yonke into kwaye ndazama yonke enye into
As that will happen.	Njengokuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
So, another question.	Ngoko, omnye umbuzo.
You don't always seem to me.	Awubonakali njalo kum.
This way, the best way.	Le ndlela, indlela engcono.
I'm afraid I'm tired in the morning	Ndiyoyika ukuba kusasa sele ndidiniwe
And before that.	Kwaye ngaphambi koko.
I did not know at first	Ndandingazi ekuqaleni
But he could not go.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuya.
Don't take it too seriously.	Musa ukuthatha kakhulu.
Let me tell you - it was a scary place.	Makhe ndikuxelele, kuya kuba nzima.
I think that's good and that's all	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile kwaye yonke loo nto
He stayed there.	Wahlala ke khona.
A little further on maybe	Phambili kancinci mhlawumbi
I didn't see anything at all about it	Andizange ndibone nto kwaphela ngaloo nto
We'll see what he does.	Siza kubona ukuba wenza ntoni.
He wants to be a doctor.	Ufuna ukuba ngugqirha.
We will try things your way.	Siza kuzama izinto ngendlela yakho.
He must have died in the night.	Umele ukuba wafa ebusuku.
He said nothing about it.	Akazange athethe nto ngayo.
I wanted to help people	Ndandifuna ukunceda abantu
A week or two.	Iveki okanye ezimbini.
I didn't know you had it on you	Bendingayazi ukuba unayo kuwe
I think you're just scared.	Ndicinga ukuba uyoyika nje.
I want you to know everything	Ndifuna wazi yonke into
I do two things very well	Ndenza izinto ezimbini kakuhle kakhulu
And he was talking.	Kwaye wayethetha.
are you 	nguwe?
I love that about you	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngawe
is everyone? 	nguye wonke umntu?
A little bit of everything	Kancinci kuyo yonke into
Or something bad.	Okanye into embi.
I want to go there.	Ndifuna ukuya phaya.
I could not meet him	Khange ndikwazi ukudibana naye
I had no idea what he was talking about	Ndandingazi tu ukuba wayethetha ngantoni
I did not want to be completely alone	Ndandingafuni ukuba ndedwa ngokupheleleyo
I can't do anything here.	Andikwazi kwenza nto apha.
I didn't see anything after that	Andizange ndibone nto emva koko
I think he also felt strange	Ndicinga ukuba naye waziva engaqhelekanga
They will talk.	Baya kuthetha.
One knows though.	Umntu uyazi nangona kunjalo.
Nobody tonight.	Akukho mntu namhlanje ebusuku.
I never saw him very much	Andizange ndimbone kakhulu
Now, a whole new person is coming.	Ngoku, kuza umntu omtsha ngokupheleleyo.
I didn't hear anything else after that	Andizange ndive enye into emva koko
Very well done, perhaps.	Yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
I haven't done much all night	Khange ndenze nto ingako ubusuku bonke
I just want to be a little higher	Ndifuna nje ukuba phezulu kancinci
I'm not sure what happened there, but something is wrong.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho, kodwa kukho into ethile.
I did not want to wait	Ndandingafuni ukulinda
I wanted to be here for you	Bendifuna ukuba lapha ngenxa yakho
It wasn't very fun.	Kwakungekho mnandi kakhulu.
I could not do anything.	Andikwazanga ukwenza nto.
Football is a thing.	Ibhola yinto.
One here and one there.	Enye apha enye phaya.
I will go my way.	Ndiya kuhamba indlela yam.
We will go now.	Siza kuhamba ngoku.
I don't want you to do that.	Andifuni ukuba wenze njalo.
But we need to act fast.	Kodwa kufuneka senze ngokukhawuleza.
It was none of his business.	Kwakungekho nto yakhe.
This is good for now.	Oku kulungile okwangoku.
I thought maybe.	Bendicinga mhlawumbi .
He knew a lot, yes he knew.	Wayesazi kakhulu, ewe wayesazi.
I did not know what he wanted from me	Bendingayazi ukuba ufuna ntoni kum
Not unless someone else wants it.	Akunjalo ngaphandle kokuba omnye umntu ufuna.
He wanted a plan.	Wayefuna icebo.
I wanted to go to work	Ndandifuna ukuya emsebenzini
I don’t remember anything else immediately after that	Andikhumbuli enye into ngokukhawuleza emva koko
Just, you know, if you're interested.	Nje, uyazi, ukuba unomdla.
Meet him for lunch.	Ukudibana naye ngesidlo sasemini.
You have to make up your mind to it.	Kufuneka wenze ingqondo yakho kuyo.
I didn't say this to stay	Khange ndithethe lento ukuze uhlale
Three in front of him.	Abathathu phambi kwakhe.
I can take someone to it though	Ndiyakwazi ukuthatha umntu kuyo nangona
I hope that happens soon	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka kungekudala
He learned one thing right away.	Wafunda into enye ngoko nangoko.
Only his eyes could be seen.	Kwakubonakala amehlo akhe kuphela.
Tomorrow there again.	Ngomso apho kwakhona.
But he knew better now.	Kodwa wayesazi ngcono ngoku.
Let me think about him.	Makhe ndicinge ngaye.
Not just your kids, kids time.	Hayi nje abantwana bakho, abantwana ixesha.
A few hours earlier in the evening may be better	Iiyure ezimbalwa kwangethuba ngokuhlwa kunokuba kulungile
A little bit there.	Kancinci apho.
I can't stay away from him	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude naye
He did a very good job	Wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu
I wanted to go with him	Bendifuna ukuhamba naye
I hope he stays with us.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala nathi.
We will not do it, he thought.	Asiyi kuyenza, wacinga.
He represents you.	Umele wena.
He just walks away.	Uhamba nje.
I could not help but do that	Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ekwenzeni oko
I would love to be more beautiful though.	Ndingathanda ukuba mhle ngakumbi nangona kunjalo.
I didn't even know how to do it	Ndandingazi nokuba ndenze njani
Then she says she doesn't have much to say.	Emva koko uthi akukho nto ingako afuna ukuyithetha.
And especially not here.	Kwaye ngakumbi hayi apha.
I like it too.	Nam ndiyayithanda.
But, it has to be the other way around.	Kodwa, kufuneka kube ngenye indlela.
I could not read well	Andikwazanga ukufunda kakuhle
How wonderful that is.	Kuhle kangakanani oko.
He realized that he had made a mistake	Waqonda ukuba wenze impazamo
The message can be as simple as.	Umyalezo unokuba lula njengoko.
I did not want to, at first.	Ndandingafuni, ekuqaleni.
We will do things together.	Siza kwenza izinto kunye.
I'm not sure you know what that is now.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo ngoku.
That's it, he thought.	Yiloo nto, wacinga.
Maybe we need time out.	Mhlawumbi sifuna ixesha ngaphandle.
I needed and needed help	Ndandifuna kwaye ndifuna uncedo
I wanted you to know	Bendifuna uyazi
I do this myself	Ndiyenza ngokwam le nto
This is good for that.	Oku kuhle ukuba.
That will require a book or maybe two or three.	Oko kuya kufuna incwadi okanye mhlawumbi ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
For just being there.	Ngokuba khona nje.
Then we go and.	Emva koko siye kwaye.
And look long and hard.	Kwaye jonga ixesha elide kwaye nzima.
But that seems like a good thing.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi yinto entle.
Let him do it.	Makayenze.
I thought it was better that way	Ndacinga ukuba kungcono ngolo hlobo
I will not go without you	Andiyi kuhamba ngaphandle kwakho
No no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi.
Nothing special.	Akukho nto engcono.
I think you just need time.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna nje ixesha.
I just want you to think about it	Ndifuna nje ucinge ngayo
A little money maybe	Imali encinci mhlawumbi
I know you can do it	Ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza
Everything is fine with me.	Yonke into ilungile ngam.
I told her another truth	Ndamxelela enye inyani
One for the other.	Omnye komnye.
I did not know anyone like that	Ndandingazi mntu ngolo hlobo
I told her that.	Ndamxelela lonto.
All day long you know where you are.	Imini yonke uyayazi ukuba uphi.
Look here to take a look.	Jonga apha ukuze ujonge.
It would be fun.	Bekuya kuba mnandi.
I did not tell him where he was	Khange ndimxelele ukuba uphi
And then down.	Kwaye ke phantsi.
It’s hard, to say the least.	Kunzima, ukuthetha kancinci.
Before or now.	Ngaphambi okanye ngoku.
I did not completely.	Andizange ngokupheleleyo.
You can do it well.	Ungayenza kakuhle.
Now you will see what happens.	Ngoku uza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And we need help.	Kwaye sifuna uncedo.
I can make my friends a little bit	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza abahlobo bam kancinci
I did not, however.	Andizange, nangona kunjalo.
I need to do this quickly	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngokukhawuleza oku
I look at everyone	Ndijonge wonke umntu
I hope it will continue, though.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuqhubeka, nangona kunjalo.
At the top, of course, of course.	Phezulu, kunjalo, kunjalo.
I did not hear anything	khange ndive nto
You can not make more time.	Awukwazi ukwenza ixesha elingakumbi.
I hope you will come back	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kubuya
Your girlfriend.	Intombi yakho.
It’s clear to me, of course.	Kucacile kum, kunjalo.
I did not look long	Khange ndijonge ixesha elide
I didn't know why	Bendingazi noba kutheni
I feel, and I feel, and I feel.	Ndiziva, kwaye ndiziva, kwaye ndiziva.
Like you last night.	Njengawe phezolo.
No one knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into.
Lots of money and of course.	Imali eninzi kwaye kunjalo.
I'm afraid you're saying the wrong thing	Ndiyoyika ukuba uthetha into engalunganga
I really want to stay	Ndifuna kakhulu ukuhlala
I will have to talk about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndithethe malunga nayo.
Tell others about it.	Xelela abanye ngayo.
I think that's why he came here today	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto eze apha namhlanje
I have to go fast	Kufuneka ndihambe ngokukhawuleza
Why did he come? 	Kwakutheni ukuze eze?
I did not have much time.	Andizange ndibe nexesha elide.
I could not go far.	Andikwazanga ukuya kude.
And to speak.	Kwaye ukuthetha.
Well, really.	Kulungile, ngenene.
I knew dinner was going to be soon	Ndandisazi ukuba isidlo sangokuhlwa siza kuba kungekudala
I have to stay here in the house	Kufuneka ndihlale apha endlini
So it should not be too difficult.	Ngoko akufanele kube nzima kangako.
I don't know how it is right now.	Andazi ukuba njani okwangoku.
He knew he had to say something else.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka athethe enye into.
It's a strange thing to talk about.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ukuthetha ngayo.
I know you will never know	Ndiyazi soze wazi
I don't know if you know that.	Andazi noba uyayazi na lonto.
Finally, something happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kukho into eyenzekayo.
My parents said yes.	Abazali bam bathi ewe.
He did not say anything, however, to help.	Akazange athethe nto, nangona kunjalo, ukunceda.
We just have to go.	Kufuneka sihambe kuphela.
He thought that was strange.	Wayecinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
I better do it now	Kungcono ndenze njalo ngoku
Well where you have it, too.	Kulungile apho unayo, kwakhona.
I want us both to do it together	Ndifuna siyenze sobabini kunye
And so, and so forth.	Kwaye njalo, njalo njalo.
I will be both.	Ndiya kuba bobabini.
That requires an answer.	Oko kufuna impendulo.
And you can't be better.	Kwaye awukwazi ukuba ngcono.
I want to talk to you	ndifuna ukuthetha nawe
It is impossible for us to do so.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba siyenze.
No, no, it's not.	Hayi, hayi, akunjalo.
There are many mistakes.	Kukho iimpazamo ezininzi.
That's what he's talking about.	Yiloo nto ethetha ngayo.
Nice to see you	Ndiyavuya ukubona
It makes it harder for us to find work.	Kwenza kube nzima kuthi ukufumana umsebenzi.
I did not know that he was telling the truth	Bendingayazi ukuba uthetha inyani
I love that book.	Ndiyayithanda loo ncwadi.
Not this one.	Hayi lo.
I do not know	Andikwazi mna
By the way then he left.	Ngendlela ngoko wemka.
I did not wait long for an answer	Khange ndilinde ixesha elide impendulo
And that will be easy enough.	Kwaye oko kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo.
I will get a new job	Ndiza kufumana umsebenzi omtsha
If so, you are making a serious mistake.	Ukuba kunjalo, wenza impazamo enkulu.
I think it is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I did not speak well	Khange ndithethe kakuhle
Because that's right.	Kuba ilungile loo nto.
Too much money	Imali eninzi kakhulu
I want to talk to you a little bit	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe kancinci
I do not remember exactly what happened to me recently	Andikhumbuli kakuhle ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kum mva nje
I came up with all that	Ndize nayo yonke loo nto
That's what you need to know.	Yiloo nto ekufuneka uyazi.
I knew why he came here	Ndandisazi isizathu sokuba eze apha
I could not stop at the time	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka ngexesha
Maybe that's why he was afraid.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto wayesoyika.
Again and again and again and again and again.	Kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
All right, in the afternoon.	Kulungile, emva kwemini.
In the afternoon.	Emva kwemini.
I never sat down again	Khange ndiphinde ndihlale phantsi
I know it very well	Ndiyazi kakuhle kakhulu
Maybe my parents.	Mhlawumbi abazali bam.
This is great.	Oku kakuhle.
I didn’t do it, though.	Andizange ndiyenze, nangona kunjalo.
Impossible, or will be, but it is.	Akunakwenzeka, okanye kuya kuba, kodwa kunjalo.
But they will return immediately.	Kodwa baya kubuya kanye.
Not all of that.	Hayi yonke loo nto.
I want to eat.	Ndifuna ukutya.
And this is what we know.	Kwaye yile nto siyazi ngayo.
I know it can be difficult	Ndiyazi ukuba kunokuba nzima
One would be wrong.	Omnye uya kuba engalunganga.
I know that, too.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, nam.
I want her to eat well	Ndifuna atye kakuhle
I thought about going but did not	Ndacinga ukuya kodwa andizange
Maybe it's you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe.
I know what he wants	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo

I haven't heard of him since	Andizange ndive ngaye ukusukela oko

We will do this ourselves.	Siya kuyenza ngokwethu le nto.
I can't go now	Andikwazi ukuya ngoku
I will decide what happens	Ndiza kuthatha isigqibo sokuba kwenzeka ntoni

We need to do the right thing	Kufuneka senze into elungileyo

I never thought that was the case at all	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yiloo nto kwaphela
You will not go.	Awuyi kuhamba.
But he did it, because it was his job.	Kodwa wakwenza oko, kuba ngumsebenzi wakhe.
He spoke only the truth.	Wathetha inyani kuphela.
I would really like	Ndingathanda ngokwenene
I thought about everything	Ndacinga ngayo yonke into
And by the way, you are the only one.	Kwaye ngendlela, nguwe wedwa.
Is this.	Ngaba le.
He decided to simplify it.	Wagqiba ekubeni enze lula.
He has gone with it.	Uye wahamba ngayo.
I know that place very well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo ndawo.
I should have done that right away	Bekufanele ndiyenzile loo nto ngoko nangoko
There is nothing in it, not now.	Akukho nto kuyo, hayi ngoku.
I'm going there now	Ndiya khona ngoku

And you want to stay, you want to.	Kwaye ufuna ukuhlala, uyafuna.
Everyone is really happy for her.	Wonke umntu uyavuya ngokwenene kuye.

You should have known better.	Bekufanele wazi ngcono.
I thought it was impossible at first	Ndandicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka ekuqaleni

I don't know what he did there	Andazi ukuba wenza ntoni apho
I can't think of anything else	Andikwazi ukucinga enye into
He opened my door.	Wavula ucango lwam.
I'm trying to think of something else	Ndizama ukucinga ngenye into
Probably, too.	Mhlawumbi, kakhulu.
I have to go to work tomorrow	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini ngomso
Many people say that he is	Abantu abaninzi bathi nguye
I didn't know anything else.	Ndandingazi enye into.
Don't forget this.	Ungalibali oku.
He's just such a man.	Yindoda enjalo nje.
I will not be too far behind him	Andiyi kuba kude kakhulu emva kwakhe
And more room.	Kwaye igumbi elingakumbi.
They live together in music.	Bahlala kunye umculo.
And now ours.	Kwaye ngoku wethu.
To make money.	Ukuze wenze imali.
I'm not there	Andikho apho
By the way.	Kwaye, ke.
And you know what, there's another one.	Kwaye uyazi ntoni, kukho enye.
Good man, good man	Umntu olungileyo, umntu olungileyo
He can't do that.	Akakwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Everyone knows a lot now.	Wonke umntu uyazi kakhulu ngoku.

I'm going to do that tonight	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto ngokuhlwanje

The truth is that you need to know better.	Inyaniso kukuba kufuneka wazi ngcono.
What, it is.	Ntoni, yiyo.
Nothing more than that, really.	Akukho nto ngaphezu koko, ngokwenene.
We need to make this happen.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto yenzeke.
That certainly did not happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ayizange yenzeke loo nto.
I don't think you can do that.	Andiqondi ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
My parents still live there.	Abazali bam bahlala khona nangoku.
But two things are required.	Kodwa kufuneka izinto ezimbini.
I did not tell him.	Khange ndimxelele.
I was thinking about you all the time	Bendicinga ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha
I can never do this again	Andikwazi kuphinda ndiyenze le nto
I want you inside of me, right now	Ndifuna wena ngaphakathi kum, ngoku
Slowly, slowly	Kancinci kancinci, ngokukhawuleza kancinci
I certainly did not tell anyone	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange ndixelele mntu
I'm trying to find a name.	Ndizama ukufumana igama.
I need a plan.	Ndifuna icebo.
I told my mother that, and she understood	Ndamxelela umama oko, waqonda
He wants to stay in bed.	Ufuna ukuhlala ebhedini.
Everyone loves this place.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda le ndawo.
We will not go.	Asiyi kuhamba.
He cannot speak.	Akakwazi ukuthetha.
I haven't done any of that in a long time	Andizange ndiyenze nayiphi na loo nto ixesha elide
You feel better, too.	Uziva ngcono, nawe.
Or buy some.	Okanye uthenge ezinye.
But not at first.	Kodwa hayi ekuqaleni.
The more, the better.	Kakhulu, ngcono kakhulu.
Forward.	Phambili.
Well, not long ago.	Kulungile, hayi kudala.
Yes, he would go.	Ewe, wayeza kuhamba.
If you succeed, that's fine.	Ukuba uphumelele, kuhle.
I don't know what time it is	Andazi ukuba ngubani ixesha
He looked my way.	Wajonga indlela yam.
I think that's too long	Ndicinga ukuba ixesha elide kakhulu
It will certainly not be hard to find	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kuba nzima ukufumana
I have to think it will show	Ndifanele ukucinga ukuba kuya kubonakala
But you know better.	Kodwa wazi ngcono.
He had to think about it before making that decision.	Kwafuneka acinge ngayo ngaphambi kokuba enze isigqibo.
I could not stop	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka
Our father.	Utata wethu .
As he asked.	Njengoko wabuza.
It must be tomorrow.	Kumele ukuba kusasa.
I mean, great thing	Ndithetha, into enkulu
I will definitely do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
I thought you knew that	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi lonto
Or to you.	Okanye kuwe.
I have done it all before	Ndenze konke ngaphambili
Money is power.	Imali ngamandla.
Everything will be that simple.	Yonke into iya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
I want him to be a good person	Ndifuna abe ngumntu olungileyo
Maybe he ran away.	Mhlawumbi wabaleka.
And it will continue to be that way.	Kwaye kuya kuqhubeka kunjalo.
I had to see a little better	Kwafuneka ndibone ngcono kancinci
There is no way to do that well.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza kakuhle oko.
If it is you.	Ukuba nguwe.
We will do it that way.	Siza kuyenza ngaloo ndlela.
I thought a lot about it	Ndacinga kakhulu ngayo
He went out with him.	Waphuma naye.
I arrived home exhausted.	Ndifike endlini ndidiniwe.
I never talked to him about that	Khange ndithethe naye oko
I haven't seen what it is, yet	Andizange ndibone ukuba yintoni, okwangoku
I want to know what happened and why	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kwaye kutheni
I really want two but.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ezimbini kodwa.
I feel like I did something good	Ndiziva ngathi ndenze into entle
And ours is not.	Kwaye wethu akunjalo.
You speak alone.	Uthetha wedwa.
Can't you ?.	Awukwazi?.
He made a good speech.	Wenza intetho entle.
I never thought of anything worse	Andizange ndicinge enye into embi
I think it will be all night	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba ubusuku bonke
I can't work on it	Andikwazi ukusebenza malunga nayo
He doesn't want to do that.	Akafuni kuyenza loo nto.
I saw an opportunity	Ndibone ithuba
I went to college	Ndaya ekholejini
This will take some time, however.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha, nangona kunjalo.

He ran away from the others.	Wabaleka ezinye.
But for now it's okay.	Kodwa okwangoku kulungile.
I thought that was a good thing.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
I did not hear anything	Khange ndive kwanto

No, the letter.	Hayi, ileta.
Her picture is here.	Umfanekiso wakhe ulapha.
Does anyone know?	Ngaba umntu uyakwazi?

I will surely do it again	ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona

If there is no car, then something in the house.	Ukuba akukho imoto, ngoko into endlwini.
To me it’s everything.	Kum yinto yonke.
And why? 	Kwaye kutheni?
I am in him.	Mna kuye.
I want to leave tomorrow.	Ndifuna ukuhamba ngomso.
Just one question.	Umbuzo nje omnye.
It wasn't him then.	Yayingenguye emva koko.
I would love to see you there !.	Ndingathanda ukubona apho!.
I can't wait to learn farther away from you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda kude ngakumbi kuwe.
I don't think there is anyone else here.	Andiqondi ukuba ukhona omnye umntu apha.
If you do, you will have to say something.	Ukuba wenza njalo, kuya kufuneka uthethe into ethile.
Soon, he thought.	Kungekudala, wacinga.
He quickly finished eating, and off he went.	Wagqiba ngokukhawuleza ukutya, waza wahamba.
He also knew.	Naye wayesazi.
And certainly enough.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
Obviously so.	Kucacile ukuba kunjalo.
I like it very much.	Ndiyayithanda kakhulu.
If you think this could be your thing, it probably is.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba le nto inokuba yinto yakho, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
I never went to town.	Andizange ndiye edolophini.
He had to stop thinking like that.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukucinga ngolo hlobo.
That's what it is, then.	Yiloo nto ke, ngoko.
Not so much, not so fast.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I wanted him to talk.	Bendifuna athethe.
My son looked at me.	Wajonga kum unyana wam.
My father went out.	Utata waphuma phandle.
This does not have to be true.	Oku akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube yinyani.
Now you are interested.	Ngoku unomdla.
I can't find that question.	Andikwazi ukufumana loo mbuzo.
He thought better of it.	Wayecinga ngcono ngayo.
Not to that, either.	Hayi kuloo nto, nayo.
But not this thing.	Kodwa hayi le nto.
Then he started studying music.	Emva koko waqalisa ukufunda umculo.
Sounds good this time.	Kubonakala kulungile ngeli xesha.
And you have to tell him.	Kwaye kufuneka umxelele.
I will come to you.	Ndiya kuza kuwe.
Do we have to do the right thing?	Kufuneka senze into elungileyo?
He said something to himself.	Wathetha into ethetha yedwa.
I told her that it was a good idea	Ndamxelela ukuba licebo elihle elo
And thank you for that.	Kwaye enkosi ngaloo nto.
Once you think about it, you do it.	Emva kokuba ucinga, uyenza.
He never told me much.	Akazange andixelele kakhulu.
But still there is a problem.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo kukho ingxaki.
My little house.	Indlu yam encinci.
I want this as soon as possible	Ndifuna le nto ngokukhawuleza
Not so much but enough.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
You do not have to say anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uthethe nantoni na.
So he has to do it his way	Ngoko ke kufuneka ayenze ngendlela yakhe
She would love to now, too.	Angathanda ngoku, naye.
What happened to it.	Kwenzeka ntoni kuyo.
But you know what it is.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
But you know, a little money for me.	Kodwa uyazi, imali encinci kum.
Done will be and should, soon.	Yenziwe iya kuba kwaye kufuneka, kungekudala.
The controversy goes away.	Utata wahamba.
Then he went forward again.	Emva koko waya phambili kwakhona.
I was thinking about money.	Bendicinga ngemali.
I'll be back just a little bit.	Ndiza kubuya nje kancinci.
To me, about me.	Kum, malunga nam.
You should not be here.	Akufanele ube lapha.
He spoke well though.	Wayethetha kakuhle kunjalo.
Not you, but the question.	Hayi wena, kodwa umbuzo.
It could be true.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
So you have to go further.	Ngoko kufuneka uye phambili.
Just once.	Kanye nje ixesha.
Thinking takes too long.	Ukucinga kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
Nobody wants to go there again.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuya apho kwakhona.
Thank you for the money.	Enkosi ngemali.
Apparently not.	Kubonakala ukuba akunjalo.
I have been thinking a lot about work lately.	Bendicinga kakhulu ngomsebenzi mva nje.
I tried to read my book.	Ndazama ukufunda incwadi yam.
It was also apparent.	Kwakhona kwakubonakala .
Either way.	Ngenye indlela.
It could be a man.	Inokuba yindoda.
There will always be an error.	Kuya kuhlala kukho impazamo.
I thought that was it.	Ndacinga ukuba yiloo nto.
Some say yes and some say no.	Abanye bathi ewe kwaye abanye bathi hayi.
Help me some time.	Ndincede elinye ixesha.
I can't do things.	Andikwazi ukwenza izinto.
And maybe even better.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ngcono.
I'm so sorry for it.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngayo.
We both know.	Sobabini siyazi.
Before you know it, you like it better outside.	Ngaphambi kokuba uyazi, uyayithanda ngcono ngaphandle.
He has done it perfectly.	Uyenzile ngokupheleleyo.
But not for you.	Kodwa hayi ngawe.
Please come to the hospital.	Ndicela uze esibhedlele.
He knew he was not with her at all.	Wayesazi ukuba akazange abe naye ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe we should.	Mhlawumbi sifanele senze.
In the evening, dinner together.	Ngokuhlwa, isidlo kunye.
I am very sorry for what happened.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngale nto yenzekileyo.
Clearly he is not.	Kucacile ukuba akakho.
My wife was away for just a few days.	Umfazi wam wayengekho nje iintsuku ezimbalwa.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye.
That is a fact, some people will do it.	Leyo yinyani, abanye abantu baya kuyenza.
I was thinking badly.	Bendicinga kakubi.
He told her to stay outside.	Wamxelela ukuba ahlale ngaphandle.
He wants to be better.	Ufuna ukuba ngcono.
He felt so much better then.	Waziva engcono kakhulu ngoko.
You must have heard about him.	Umele ukuba weva ngaye.
And he also does not know.	Kwaye naye akayazi.
Some after you leave.	Abanye emva kokuba uhambe.
There was no one, but no one.	Kwakungekho mntu, kodwa kwakungekho mntu.
Knowing how and knowing that.	Ukwazi ukuba njani kwaye ukwazi oko.
I certainly do.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndenza njalo.
If you are interested in it, though.	Ukuba unomdla kuyo, nokuba.
More than anyone else.	Ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
Then, finally, it's time.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni, lixesha.
Really more than that.	Ngokwenene ngaphezu koko.
You know a lot of what happened here.	Uyayazi into eninzi eyenzekileyo apha.
I think everyone does it.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayenza.
There is no one behind me.	Akukho mntu emva kwam.
He lives very much alone here.	Uhlala wedwa kakhulu apha.
He hoped it would happen again and again.	Wayenethemba lokuba iya kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
But, this, of course, is certainly not possible.	Kodwa, oku kunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
Then she ran out of the hospital.	Emva koko wabaleka waphuma esibhedlele.
Now he did not know what was coming.	Ngoku wayengazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
There is little to do with that money.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza naloo mali.
I just didn’t want to be in front of me.	Bendingafuni nje phambi kwam.
Nobody comes here unless they want something.	Akukho mntu uza apha ngaphandle kokuba kukho into ayifunayo.
Please come as soon as possible.	Nceda uze ngokukhawuleza.
He looked inside her.	Wajonga ngaphakathi kuye.
I wanted to stay in bed all day.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala ebhedini imini yonke.
Everyone knows what's going on.	Wonke umntu uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
But it is only possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka kuphela.
Not just friends.	Hayi nje abahlobo.
He sat as if tired.	Wahlala ngathi udiniwe.
He would do it alone.	Wayeza kwenza nje yedwa.
Then he started talking.	Emva koko waqalisa ukuthetha.
It just had to.	Kwafuneka nje.
You knew nothing about it.	Ubungazi nto ngayo.
You don't have to do that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze loo nto.
His only chance.	Ithuba lakhe kuphela.
Nobody goes home.	Akukho mntu uya ekhaya.
In the end, he thought it was nothing.	Ekugqibeleni, wayecinga ukuba kwakungekho nto.
Not because of you.	Akunjalo ngenxa yakho.
You know you love her.	Uyazi ukuba uyamthanda.
Even a little better.	Nokuba ngcono kancinci.
He was making up his mind then.	Wayenza ingqondo yakhe ngoko.
You know you're not going.	Uyazi ukuba awuyi.
I could not stop talking about you.	Khange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukuthetha ngawe.
This is better than the father and not the mother.	Lo ungcono utata hayi umama.
Well, there is something else.	Kulungile, kukho enye into.
True a little more.	Yinyani ngakumbi kancinci.
I told you more later.	Ndikuxelele ngakumbi kamva.
This happened early today.	Oku kwenzeke kwangoko namhlanje.
Then she ran downstairs to the house.	Emva koko wabaleka wehla wabuyela ngaphakathi endlwini.
He looked.	Wajonga .
I do not understand why this is.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni le nto.
Nothing more than you.	Akukho ngaphezu kwakho.
Or anything about me.	Okanye nantoni na ngam.
But maybe you want something.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ufuna into ethile.
Speech.	Intetho.
No place for me.	Akukho ndawo yam.
Nothing happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke nto.
Food at work.	Ukutya emsebenzini.
You have my letter, you know what's going on this afternoon.	Unayo ileta yam, uyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni ngale njikalanga.
I think, of course.	Ndiyacinga, kunjalo.
It would be good to do so.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba wenze njalo.
He really ran away.	Ngenene wabaleka.
We will do it.	Siza kwenza.
Your job is to be his friend.	Umsebenzi wakho kukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
I can not see.	Andikwazi kubona.
No one.	Akukho nokuba ngubani.
Yes that is very good.	Ewe oko kuhle kakhulu.
He did the same thing though.	Wenza into enye kodwa.
This is the place.	Ke le ndawo.
There was no one eating too much, of course.	Kwakungekho mntu utya kakhulu, kunjalo.
So, we will continue.	Ngoko, siza kuqhubeka.
Not just doing something.	Hayi nje ukwenza into.
He decided then himself.	Wagqiba ngoko ngokwakhe.
I want nothing from you.	Andifuni nto kuwe.
Just like me, then.	Kanye nam, ngoko.
Whether, or, or, or.	Nokuba, okanye, nokuba, okanye.
He had to do something.	Bekufanele enze into.
No it is not possible.	Hayi akunakwenzeka.
Something in that, maybe.	Into kuloo nto, mhlawumbi.
I really do not believe.	Andikholelwa ngokwenene.
But he did too.	Kodwa wenza nawe.
But he did not.	Kodwa akenzanga.
But that would be hard to do.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba nzima ukwenza.
Not if he thought it would.	Akunjalo ukuba wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Or maybe you just want your dog to help you at home.	Okanye mhlawumbi ufuna kuphela inja yakho ukukunceda ekhaya.
All of this is clear.	Konke oku kucacile.
Please come here.	Nceda uze apha.
I knew he would do it.	Ndandisazi ukuba iya kuyenza loo nto.
No, you already have it.	Hayi, sele unayo.
Not in this case.	Hayi le meko.
In the evening.	Ngokuhlwa.
Just beautiful.	Entle nje.
I do not want to go alone.	Andifuni ukuhamba ndedwa.
It is very clear.	Kucacile kakhulu.
But he got there.	Kodwa wafika apho.
He didn't want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Yes I do.	Ewe nam.
His mother finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni umama wakhe wavuma.
Please do so.	Nceda wenze njalo.
I've lived here too long.	Ndihlale ixesha elide kakhulu apha.
Although he tried.	Nangona wazama.
He will not know.	Akayi kukwazi.
No, no no no and no.	Hayi, hayi hayi hayi kwaye hayi.
He confessed what he had done.	Wavuma into ayenzileyo.
But please let us go.	Kodwa ndicela sihambe.
And it probably took a long time before we did.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kuthatha ixesha elide ngaphambi kokuba siyenze.
Maybe now you want one.	Mhlawumbi ngoku ufuna enye.
Look at the first picture.	Jonga umfanekiso wokuqala.
He knew there was a problem.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho ingxaki.
This, of course, is not the case.	Oku, ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
I think he is good to her.	Ndicinga ukuba ulungile kuye.
So don't do that.	Ngoko musa ukuyenza loo nto.
Yes, he asked.	Ewe, wabuza.
So it will be a good time.	Ngoko iya kuba lixesha elihle.
But if you read this.	Kodwa ukuba ufunda oku.
He went out and talked to him.	Waphuma phandle weza kuthetha naye.
It becomes very difficult to see when you are driving.	Kuba nzima kakhulu ukubona xa uqhuba.
i don't want a problem.	andifuni ngxaki.
For something to happen.	Ukuze kwenzeke into.
I just don’t know how I did my job.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani umsebenzi wam.
However such a mistake.	Nangona kunjalo impazamo enjalo.
Up or down.	Phezulu okanye phantsi.
Then your wife went to bed.	Walala ke umfazi wakho.
The job looks good.	Umsebenzi ukhangeleka ulungile.
Just a word.	Ilizwi kuphela.
Is this possible? 	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka?
Book there week.	Incwadi apho iveki.
I may have made a mistake.	Inokuba ndenza impazamo.
Unless you already live here.	Ngaphandle kokuba sele uhlala apha.
But we will get better.	Kodwa siya kuba ngcono.
Or rather you have.	Okanye kunokuba unayo.
I know he is telling the truth.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uthetha inyani.
Is new music.	Ngaba umculo omtsha.
This does not seem to be the case.	Oku kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
I don't know what happened there.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho.
No one says anything at first.	Akukho mntu uthetha nto ekuqaleni.
I'm not sure where you are now, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uphi ngoku, nangona kunjalo .
He was doing it in college.	Wayenza ekholejini.
Please come with me there.	Nceda uze kunye nam apho.
We need to know this.	Kufuneka siyazi oku.
More than anything.	Ngaphezu kwanto.
No, he would have to do things his way.	Akunjalo, bekuya kufuneka enze izinto ngendlela yakhe.
Then another word.	Emva koko elinye ilizwi.
And that should not be difficult.	Kwaye oko akufanele kube nzima.
That's why we come.	Yiyo loo nto siza.
Everything you need to know.	Yonke into ekufuneka uyazi.
Slightly at first.	Kancinci ekuqaleni.
You told her that.	Umxelele lonto.
I just looked.	Ndijonge nje.
You don't have to look at me like that.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ujonge kum ngolo hlobo.
It does something.	Kwenza into .
I'm sorry, really.	Ndicela uxolo, nyani.
He finally opened the door.	Ekugqibeleni wavula ucango.
Not in the end.	Hayi ekugqibeleni.
I have never been this far.	Khange ndifike kude kangaka.
Such a thing often happens.	Rhoqo kwenzeka into enjalo.
And speaking, obviously.	Kwaye ukuthetha, ngokucacileyo.
But you made a mistake.	Kodwa wenze impazamo.
I had to think.	Bekufanele ndicinge.
But it did not happen.	Kodwa ayizange yenzeke.
You will find someone.	Uya kufumana umntu.
Maybe it would have been a little better at the top.	Mhlawumbi bekuya kuba ngcono kancinci phezulu.
His work should not be so difficult.	Umsebenzi wakhe akufanele ube nzima kangako.
The best place for him to go, really.	Indawo engcono kakhulu yokuba aye kuyo, ngokwenene.
No, no good, moreover.	Hayi, hayi kuhle, ngaphezu koko.
This will be difficult though.	Oku kuya kuba nzima nangona kunjalo.
But all is well.	Kodwa konke kuhle.
Not ours but for you.	Hayi wethu kodwa ngenxa yakho.
A little too fast.	Kancinci ngokukhawuleza.
I arrived home late.	Ndifike late ekhaya.
Yes, you may be busy.	Ewe usenokuba uxakekile.
Just you and me.	Wena nam kuphela.
I don't know if this is true or not.	Andazi nokuba yinyani na le okanye hayi.
It's hard to make a picture.	Kunzima ukwenza umfanekiso.
Everything inside you.	Konke ngaphakathi kuwe.
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Mhlawumbi ngomso ngokuhlwa.
I hope you like it here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda apha.
He has done this before.	Ukhe wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
I may not know today.	Inokuba andazi namhlanje.
Then he looked at the woman.	Emva koko wajonga umfazi.
But it will be harder every day.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi yonke imihla.
This we will not do.	Le asiyi kuyenza.
He made a living here.	Wenze ubomi apha.
I can speak now.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha ngoku.
There are things in this situation.	Kukho izinto kule meko.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.	Ndifuna ukuba nawe ubomi bam bonke.
Everyone ate quickly.	Wonke umntu watya ngokukhawuleza.
He didn't know he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba uyazi.
He hoped it was.	Wayenethemba lokuba kunjalo.
I just don't care.	Andikhathali nje.
He got there in the afternoon.	Ufike apho emva kwemini.
I should not have been with him here.	Bekungafanelanga ndibe naye apha.
Man, that's fine.	Mntu, loo nto ilungile.
I certainly knew about him.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandisazi ngaye.
Again thank you.	Kwakhona enkosi.
But you made one mistake.	Kodwa wenze impazamo enye.
Taking something.	Ukuthatha into.
I think he thought he had succeeded.	Ndicinga ukuba wayecinga ukuba uphumelele.
Right then and there.	Kanye ngelo xesha kwaye kanye apho.
I can't tell what's going on.	Andikwazi ukuxelela ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Even more so.	Ngakumbi.
I came for work here.	Ndize ngomsebenzi apha.
That takes something else.	Oko kuthatha enye into.
I'm afraid something bad has happened.	Ndiyoyika ukuba kwenzeke into embi.
Yes you are.	Ewe ulele.
Maybe it takes a week or so.	Mhlawumbi kuthatha iveki okanye kunjalo.
So I have to go.	Ndifanele ke ngoko ukuba ndihambe.
Go with it.	Ukuhamba nayo.
There is a real problem here.	Kukho ingxaki ngokwenene apha.
I will see breakfast.	Ndiza kubona isidlo sakusasa.
There you will find some books on the floor.	Apho uya kufumana ezinye iincwadi phantsi.
Maybe even.	Mhlawumbi nokuba.
All this accident.	Yonke le ngozi.
No one travels alone.	Akukho mntu uhamba yedwa.
Just like you.	Njengawe nje.
You will get an immediate response.	Uza kufumana impendulo ngokukhawuleza.
You do not have to do it again.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uyenze kwakhona.
I will have him here.	Ndiza kuba naye apha.
But he went with it.	Kodwa wahamba nayo.
Give me a lot of people.	Ndinike abantu abaninzi.
Better not to.	Kungcono hayi.
I would like to go again.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba kwakhona.
You can't.	Awunako.
I think that happens a lot.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kwenzeka kakhulu.
So it's hard.	Ngoko kunzima.
There was no way for him to speak his way.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokuba athethe ngendlela yakhe.
Yes, the effort is worth it.	Ewe, ukuzama kunjalo.
I'm not with him.	Andikho naye.
Certainly everywhere.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho yonke indawo.
I am so glad that I can tell you this.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba ndikwazi ukukuxelela oku.
One was absent.	Omnye wayengekho.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
But it was not today.	Kodwa kwakungekho namhlanje.
He has suggested that we do it again.	Uye wacebisa ukuba siyenze kwakhona.
He made all people.	Wenza bonke abantu.
Probably his whole life.	Mhlawumbi ubomi bakhe bonke.
He did it for me.	Uye wayenza kum.
Later, however.	Kamva, nangona kunjalo.
Finally he was able to think of something.	Ekugqibeleni wakwazi ukucinga ngento ethile.
He did not try to speak.	Akazange azame ukuthetha.
Unless you wish to try, it is.	Ngaphandle kokuba unqwenela ukuzama, kunjalo.
Speaking.	Ukuthetha.
He left that place immediately after this.	Wemka kuloo ndawo kanye emva kokuba kwenzeke oku.
But we will certainly succeed.	Kodwa siya kuphumelela ngokuqinisekileyo.
And he went out and departed.	Waphuma ke wahamba.
He did not want anyone to be with him.	Engazange afune nabani na ukuba abe kunye naye.
You can be ahead of your time.	Unokuba ngaphambi kwexesha lakho.
I really look up to him.	Ndijonge kuye ngokwenene.
I think my dad is here.	Ndicinga ukuba utata ulapha.
If he only knew.	Ukuba nje wayesazi.
One of us.	Omnye wethu.
No, obviously.	Akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
Just to see what's going on.	Ukubona nje ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
It has been necessary.	Kuye kwafuneka.
I needed time.	Bendifuna ixesha.
It is possible that.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba.
This song needs to be performed.	Le ngoma kufuneka yenziwe.
I don't think it will be so.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
I am happy to help you do your job.	Ndiyavuya ukukunceda wenze umsebenzi wakho.
He did not want me to leave.	Wayengafuni ndihambe.
Before he left he gave me some advice in the afternoon.	Ngaphambi kokuba ahambe wandinika icebiso emva kwemini.
And you do not have to.	Kwaye akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
Yes, but you have to be serious about it.	Ewe, kodwa kufuneka uzimisele ngayo.
No, you probably won't.	Hayi, mhlawumbi awuyi.
I will find a way or do another.	Ndiza kufumana indlela okanye ndenze enye.
I know I am.	Ndiyazi ukuba ndim.
He looks good, by the way.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle, ngendlela.
I have to do better.	Kufuneka ndenze ngcono.
I will come back to you.	ndiya kubuya ndize kuwe.
Location, place, place !.	Indawo, indawo, indawo!.
I tried a big house.	Ndazama indlu enkulu.
But, this is not the case.	Kodwa, oku akunjalo.
She would like to know.	Angathanda ukwazi.
Well, like we got to it.	Kulungile, ngathi siza kufika kuyo.
Much better than me.	Ngcono kakhulu kunam.
There is no way to do it.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza.
I'm not there.	Andikho apho.
What a thing.	Yintoni into.
I had no idea what was going on with it.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuyo.
Good for me !.	Ilungile kum!.
But a similar problem arose.	Kodwa kwenzeka ingxaki efanayo.
But not for me.	Kodwa akukho ngenxa yam.
And it's not hard to do.	Kwaye akukho nzima ukwenza.
And it is probably true.	Kwaye kusenokwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
He walked to his car.	Wahamba waya emotweni yakhe.
I will definitely buy one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuthenga enye.
But though.	Kodwa nangona.
What he was going to do about it, he didn't know.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni ngaloo nto, wayengazi.
I was late for work.	Ndifike emva kwexesha emsebenzini.
He says he should talk to me.	Uthi kufuneka athethe nam.
How do you plan to do this?	Uceba ukwenza njani oku.
People, not so much.	Abantu, hayi kakhulu.
He will definitely stay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala.
I would like one.	Ndingathanda enye.
But you have to wait here.	Kodwa kufuneka ulinde apha.
Any of us.	Nabani na kuthi.
Because of that.	Kuba loo nto.
He told her she had to do the right thing.	Wamxelela ukuba kufuneka enze into elungileyo.
I just can't work.	Andikwazi nje ukusebenza.
He would try there.	Wayeza kuzama apho.
Only, not this one.	Kuphela, hayi oku.
And yes, yes.	Kwaye ewe, ewe.
I wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza ngaloo nto.
I can't get out of the house.	Andikwazi ukuphuma endlini.
Suddenly he felt better.	Ngokukhawuleza waziva engcono.
I did not tell anyone what had happened.	Khange ndixelele mntu ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
So he did not say much to her.	Ngoko akazange athethe kakhulu kuye.
He went in and lay down.	Wangena walala.
And yet it will not be too difficult.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo akuyi kuba nzima kakhulu.
I'm glad he did well.	Ndiyavuya ukuba enze kakuhle.
He made it impossible.	Wenza ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I want something to do.	Ndifuna into yokwenza.
Just you.	Wena nje.
I do not know this.	Andazi ukuba le.
Really little money.	Imali encinci ngokwenene.
He immediately recognized that he was not human.	Waqonda ngoko nangoko ukuba akangomntu.
I know my way there.	Ndiyayazi indlela yam apho.
That always is.	Oko kuhlala kunjalo.
Or a cat.	Okanye ikati.
But not all the time.	Kodwa hayi lonke ixesha.
But it's hard for me to see at night.	Kodwa kunzima kum ukubona ebusuku.
There are certainly many more.	Kukho ezinye ngokuqinisekileyo ezininzi.
I know better now, of course.	Ndiyazi ngcono ngoku, kunjalo.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba.
All but impossible.	Konke kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He will go with us now.	Uza kuhamba nathi ngoku.
What you have to do, what you have to do.	Kufuneka wenze ntoni, wenze ntoni.
I would like to meet your children.	Ndingathanda ukudibana nabantwana bakho.
She knew he looked good.	Wayesazi ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle.
Again, no it is not.	Kwakhona, hayi akunjalo.
I went to work, really.	Ndaya emsebenzini, ngokwenene.
Don't talk like that again.	Musa ukuthetha ngolo hlobo kwakhona.
Unless he knew it was so.	Ngaphandle kokuba wayesazi ukuba kunjalo.
He also knew when.	Wayesazi nokuba nini.
Not here though.	Hayi apha kodwa.
My wife is the first one.	Umfazi wam ngowokuqala.
You can't talk about that.	Awukwazi ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
He was not there at all.	Wayengekho kwaphela apho.
I had never spoken to him before or to his father.	Andizange ndithethe naye ngaphambili okanye utata wakhe.
I mean, a lot.	Ndithetha, kakhulu.
He will be here soon.	Uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
He said yes it is.	Uye wathi ewe kunjalo.
Your all.	Yakho yonke.
I will definitely succeed.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuphumelela.
You have to look at it.	Kufuneka ujonge kuyo.
He thought that was a good idea.	Wayecinga ukuba licebo elihle elo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba njalo.
Previously, however.	Ngaphambili, nangona kunjalo.
I just want to do some work.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi.
But the book must be good.	Kodwa ke incwadi kufuneka ilungile.
And maybe that's why.	Kwaye mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
Yes, he wanted a wife.	Ewe, wayefuna umfazi.
One day he slept in my room.	Ngenye imini walala egumbini lam.
Not much to talk about.	Akukho kakhulu ukuthetha ngayo.
Well, it's done.	Hayi ke, yenziwe.
The truth is, it's not that easy.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
But just before we did, this happened.	Kodwa kanye ngaphambi kokuba senze, oku kwenzeka.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
If you have ever done.	Ukuba ukhe wenza.
I am everything.	Ndim yonke into.
Now you are.	Ngoku unjalo.
My beautiful wife.	Umfazi wam omhle.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngomso.
But he will stay.	Kodwa uya kuhlala.
Then, there is the problem.	Emva koko, kukho ingxaki.
You don't want to make a story out of yourself.	Awufuni ukwenza ibali ngawe.
You have your time.	Unexesha lakho.
That's a lot of places today.	Yiyo indawo ezininzi namhlanje.
That's his age.	Nantso iminyaka yakhe.
The question did not come up.	Umbuzo awuzange ufike.
I talked about it in the afternoon.	Ndithetha ngayo emva kwemini.
I just can’t work like that.	Andikwazi nje ukusebenza ngolo hlobo.
You play hard every day.	Udlala nzima yonke imihla.
But, it can be difficult.	Kodwa, kunokuba nzima.
This would be a bad thing.	Oku kuya kuba yinto embi.
He really does the job.	Wenza umsebenzi ngenene.
And he's ready to talk.	Kwaye ukulungele ukuthetha.
The answer will be.	Impendulo iya kuba.
You do not have to look good.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ujonge kakuhle.
Something happened to you.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuwe.
But he did not go into his bedroom.	Kodwa akazange angene kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
We want a picture.	Sifuna umfanekiso.
I don't have to go.	Akufunekanga ndihambe.
It is very difficult to walk now.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba ngoku.
You must be tired.	Kumele ukuba udiniwe.
However, not my performance call.	Nangona kunjalo, hayi umnxeba wam wokwenza.
But I’m happy this time, really.	Kodwa ndiyavuya ngeli xesha, ngokwenene.
Let me tell you something unusual.	Makhe ndikuxelele into engaqhelekanga.
I wonder why this is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni le nto.
Take a quick look, if you like.	Jonga ngokukhawuleza, ukuba uyathanda.
I decided on that.	Ndenze isigqibo kuloo nto.
Just as he wanted.	Kanye njengoko wayefuna.
I can't wait, though.	Andikwazi kulinda, nangona kunjalo.
This is true, not at all.	Oku kunjalo, akunjalo konke konke.
Then, finally.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni.
I know that can be difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba inokuba nzima oko.
Or maybe at any time.	Okanye mhlawumbi nanini na.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo.
And there is much more.	Kwaye kukho okuninzi ngakumbi.
But you can't tell.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuxelela.
Before that, really.	Ngaphambi koko, ngokwenene.
And they will succeed.	Kwaye baya kuphumelela.
I would like to read more.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngakumbi.
This is really the thing.	Le yinto ngenene.
And now my parents.	Kwaye ngoku abazali bam.
I know what.	Ndiyazi yintoni.
I think that's a big deal.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto enkulu leyo.
He wondered what to expect.	Wayecinga ukuba ulindele ntoni.
I can't dwell on that.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kuloo nto.
I would have to be in this situation.	Bekuya kufuneka ndibe kule meko.
I want him to talk.	Ndifuna athethe.
Now he is acting strangely.	Ngoku wenza ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
He wanted his parents.	Wayefuna abazali bakhe.
I wanted my life back.	Bendifuna ubomi bam kwakhona.
I came to him.	Ndifike kuye.
I will never talk about that again today.	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe ngaloo nto namhlanje.
But now I love it.	Kodwa ngoku ndiyayithanda.
Making it harder to drive.	Ukwenza ukuba nzima ukuqhuba.
Well, not really, obviously.	Ewe, akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
I want all night for me.	Ndifuna ubusuku bonke kum.
I know where you are going.	Ndiyazi apho uya khona.
He told me everything about it.	Uye wandixelela yonke into ngayo.
That is a very unusual thing to do.	Yinto engaqhelekanga kwaphela leyo.
This is not possible internally.	Oku akunakwenzeka ngaphakathi.
Not if there is a problem with that.	Hayi ukuba kukho ingxaki kuloo nto.
It is something you have to live with.	Yinto ekufuneka uhlale nayo.
He has been gone all day.	Uhambe imini yonke.
Nobody wanted to do anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza nantoni na.
Money is time.	Imali lixesha.
And enough of that for now.	Kwaye ngokwaneleyo oko okwangoku.
There was no one, because no one was there.	Kwakungekho mntu, kuba kwakungekho mntu.
There is a good doctor who wants to see you.	Kukho ugqirha olungileyo ofuna ukudibana nawe.
Maybe you are too.	Mhlawumbi nawe unjalo.
One left.	Omnye wemka.
Anyone willing to help one another.	Nabani na ukulungele ukunceda omnye.
Just at the beginning.	Kanye ekuqaleni.
That's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene leyo.
He wanted to stay with you.	Wayefuna ukuhlala nawe.
Just, really late.	Nje, ngenene emva kwexesha.
You know the answer to all the questions.	Uyayazi impendulo kuyo yonke imibuzo.
That is a big job.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu lowo.
Everyone loves money.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda imali.
But look, there is nothing there.	Kodwa jonga, kwaye akukho nto apho.
Many will be there just like you.	Abaninzi baya kuba lapho njengawe.
Mom knows.	Umama uyazi.
But clearly, this is not possible.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, oku akunakwenzeka.
That would be good enough for me.	Oko kunokuba kuhle ngokwaneleyo kum.
I don't care about it.	Andikhathali ngayo.
But for now we have to go.	Kodwa okwangoku kufuneka sihambe.
I don't remember actually doing it.	Andikhumbuli ndiyenza ngokwenene.
If not now, when?	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, nini?
He meant that, too.	Wayethetha loo nto, naye.
Just one problem.	Ingxaki enye nje.
But I knew I had to look.	Kodwa ndandisazi ukuba kufuneka ndijonge.
I think that's right, that's right.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo, kunjalo.
I don't think you have it.	Andiqondi ukuba unayo.
Away from food.	Kude ukutya.
And we will continue that way.	Kwaye siya kuqhubeka ngaloo ndlela.
More on that, please.	Ngakumbi koko, nceda.
This should have been easy.	Oku bekufanele kube lula.
I will do it and you have to go.	Ndiza kuyenza kwaye kufuneka uhambe.
She never told me anything.	Zange andixelele nto.
Or he may be reluctant to talk about it.	Okanye kusenokwenzeka ukuba akafuni kuthetha ngayo.
What are you talking about.	Ingaba uthetha ngantoni.
He said nothing about it.	Khange athethe nto ngalonto.
The woman is here.	Umfazi ulapha.
Only some people.	Kuphela abanye abantu.
I'm going to a party.	Ndiya epatini.
That goes with us.	Oko kuhamba nathi.
This he must do.	Oku kufuneka akwenze.
It's not fun for me.	Akukho mnandi kum.
Just a shirt.	Ihempe nje.
But not everyone.	Kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu.
I'm talking about work.	Ndithetha ngomsebenzi.
He doesn't know about me.	Akazi ngam.
I apologize .	Ndiyaxolisa .
House.	Indlu.
You are the mother.	Nguwe umama.
We will find a way.	Siza kufumana indlela.
And he also felt it.	Kwaye naye waziva.
Thanks for looking at me.	Enkosi noba ujonge kum.
Sorry, but you are here.	Uxolo, kodwa ukhona.
Now you really know.	Ngoku uyazi ngokwenene.
Finally or otherwise.	Ekugqibeleni okanye ngenye indlela.
I think that may be true.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba yinyani.
Breakfast.	Isidlo sakusasa.
A little something.	Into encinci .
Up, up and away.	Phezulu, phezulu kwaye kude.
But not the picture.	Kodwa hayi umfanekiso.
I would just like to read.	Ndingathanda nje ukufunda.
I knew now or never.	Ndandisazi ngoku okanye zange.
Everyone knows about this.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngale nto.
Something else happened about the same time.	Kwenzeka enye into malunga nexesha elinye.
And it is certainly a good thing to do.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo yinto entle ukuba yenziwe.
He is anyone.	Nguye nabani na.
That means getting out and about with you and me.	Oko kuthetha ukuphuma kwaye malunga nawe kunye nam.
He rarely does.	Akafane enze njalo.
Thank you for everything.	Enkosi ngayo yonke into.
He began to.	Waqalisa ukuba.
This will take a really long time.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha elide ngokwenene.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngoko ngomso.
Or if there is an error.	Okanye ukuba kukho impazamo.
He did that to me, before.	Wayenza loo nto kum, ngaphambili.
See how that happened.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
Maybe he was already here.	Mhlawumbi wayesele elapha.
But I think so.	Kodwa ndicinga njalo.
It would always be that way.	Bekuya kuhlala kunjalo.
Where it seems to be.	Apho kubonakala ngathi kukho.
I do not want and do not want your money.	Andifuni kwaye andifuni mali yakho.
I think, though, that it will be very good.	Ndicinga, nangona kunjalo, ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
You make and you make good money.	Wenza kwaye wenza imali entle.
Pretty good, maybe.	Mhle kanye, mhlawumbi.
My death.	Ukufa kwam.
I don't like what's going on here.	Andiyithandi into eyenzekayo apha.
You better know.	Kungcono uyazi.
But it seems that he was not able to do that.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akazange akwazi ukwenza oko.
This is what happened.	Yile nto yenzekileyo.
Then one.	Emva koko enye.
They will do it all the time.	Baya kukwenza oko lonke ixesha.
It has to be that way for now.	Kumele kube njalo okwangoku.
My father came home.	Wafika utata ekhaya.
That will happen to you.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kuwe.
I would like a little something.	Ndingathanda into encinci.
I really want to be his friend.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
This is much better.	Oku kungcono kakhulu.
I can't say one thing right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha enye into ngoku.
And that means.	Kwaye kuthetha oko.
He told me that, himself.	Wandixelela loo nto, ngokwakhe.
He went the right way.	Uhambe ngendlela elungileyo.
And he went out.	Uye waphuma ke.
So what's new.	Ke yintoni entsha.
I know him too.	Nam ndiyamazi.
He didn't, he really didn't.	Akazange, ngokwenene akazange.
It makes it so much easier.	Kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
Thank you!.	Enkosi!.
There is no such work.	Akukho msebenzi unjalo.
He came immediately.	Weza kwangoko.
He wanted to go to work.	Wayefuna ukuya emsebenzini.
You did not have any money.	Awuzange ube nayiphi na imali.
All right, tell me.	Kulungile, ndixelele.
Finding the same place.	Ukufumana indawo efanayo.
That way you're like me.	Ngaloo ndlela ufana nam.
Almost three years.	Phantse iminyaka emithathu.
My son would love books.	Unyana wam angathanda iincwadi.
But then, he would come.	Kodwa emva koko, wayeza.
He did a really good job.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle ngokwenene.
Dinner.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa.
And he's really smart at school.	Kwaye ukrelekrele ngenene esikolweni.
I could not do anything wrong.	Andikwazanga ukwenza into embi.
I went to it.	Ndaya kuyo.
For years, really.	Iminyaka, ngokwenene.
Finally he asked a question.	Ekugqibeleni wabuza umbuzo.
You just know it.	Uyayazi nje.
However, it will take a long time.	Nangona kunjalo, kuya kuthatha ixesha elide.
If you have returned home.	Ukuba uye wabuyela ekhaya.
He is here with me.	Ulapha kunye nam.
Bedtime now.	Ixesha lokulala ngoku.
How much, it is impossible to say.	Kangakanani na, akunakwenzeka ukuthetha.
Before your time, of course.	Ngaphambi kwexesha lakho, kunjalo.
You are always better off.	Uhlala ungcono wena.
It could be but.	Inokuba kodwa.
I'll say something else.	Ndiza kuthetha enye into.
So he would be.	Ngoko wayeza kuba njalo.
But she could not find a job.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
There is, however,.	Kukho, nangona kunjalo,.
I just know this.	Ndiyazi nje oku.
It seems to me that it is clear that it is.	Kubonakala kum ukuba kucacile ukuba kunjalo.
I can't tell you what.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ntoni.
If not far away.	Ukuba akukho kude.
He asked what had happened.	Wabuza ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I would like to talk about you.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngawe.
He said he liked that.	Wathi uyayithanda loo nto.
I like questions.	Ndiyayithanda imibuzo.
I should have been here.	Bekufanele ukuba ndilapha.
He left for me.	Wemka ngenxa yam.
I don't like coffee.	Andiyithandi ikofu.
That will be tomorrow.	Oko kuya kuba ngomso.
He looked up at the end.	Wajonga phezulu ekugqibeleni.
But there are a lot of people there.	Kodwa kukho abantu abaninzi apho.
We did it our way.	Senze ngendlela yethu.
So are they all.	Ngoko ke bonke.
So he agreed to everything.	Ngoko wavuma yonke into.
Years, years, years.	Iminyaka, iminyaka, iminyaka.
That’s why he stayed there long after he made his money.	Yiyo loo nto wahlala kuyo ixesha elide emva kokuba enze imali yakhe.
But it is not !.	Kodwa akunjalo!.
But what a name.	Kodwa yintoni igama.
The problem is, he is.	Ingxaki kukuba, naye unjalo.
You know my decision.	Uyasazi isigqibo sam.
But don't do it again.	Kodwa musa ukuyenza kwakhona.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni na.
He didn't say what it was.	Akazange athethe ukuba yintoni na.
Making a lot of money.	Ukwenza imali eninzi.
So do not do that alone.	Ngoko musa ukwenza kuphela.
Someone died.	Wafa umntu.
Play with it.	Ukudlala ngayo.
He didn't want her to know yet.	Wayengafuni ukuba azi okwangoku.
And it seems he never did.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi akazange.
Tell others.	Xelela abanye.
I think we know why now.	Ndicinga ukuba siyazi ukuba kutheni ngoku.
After a while, no one wanted to talk about it.	Emva kwexesha, akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
It was not too long ago.	Akuzange kube kudala kakhulu.
Overnight in town.	Ubusuku edolophini.
That's a good thing.	Nantso ke into entle.
Or do you think you know.	Okanye ucinga ukuba uyazi.
Not hard or nothing.	Hayi nzima okanye akukho nto.
That's just right.	Yinyani nje loo nto.
But, that's me.	Kodwa ke, ndim lowo.
I mean yes.	Ndithetha ewe.
This time you are lucky.	Ngeli xesha unethamsanqa.
At first he would return with breakfast.	Ekuqaleni wayeza kubuya ngesidlo sakusasa.
It's coming now.	Iza ngoku.
This can be very fun.	Oku kunokuba mnandi kakhulu.
Wife, son, or daughter.	Umfazi, unyana, okanye intombi.
I look forward to going to my office.	Ndijonge phambili ukuya eofisini yam.
I'm not sure why, but it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni, kodwa kunjalo.
I can't say anything about it, though.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto kuloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
I don't know what exactly happened.	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kanye kanye.
There is certainly nothing to play with or do.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto yokudlala okanye yokwenza.
He didn't really know why.	Wayengazi ngokwenene ukuba kutheni.
There is no time today.	Akukho xesha namhlanje.
He wanted his picture back, very bad.	Wayefuna umfanekiso wakhe emva, kakubi kakhulu.
I made my night.	Ndenze ubusuku bam.
I have to do that.	Kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto.
Or help.	Okanye uncedo.
But this happened quite differently.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngenye indlela ngokupheleleyo.
Or it seemed like at first.	Okanye kwakubonakala ngathi ekuqaleni.
Now it is difficult to talk to her.	Ngoku kunzima ukuthetha naye.
He never learned anything.	Zange afunde nto.
Opportunity to make money fast, easy.	Ithuba lokwenza imali ngokukhawuleza, lula.
That look again.	Oko jonga kwakhona.
He must have known what was going on.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I don’t know how I did something else.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani enye into.
I can't think my marriage is better.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba umtshato wam ungcono.
But you have to stay away.	Kodwa kufuneka uhlale kude.
Together.	Kunye.
Then he became very sad.	Emva koko waba buhlungu.
And he started making money right away.	Kwaye waqalisa ukwenza imali ngoko nangoko.
And far away.	Kwaye kude.
All of this happened very quickly.	Konke oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
You may be now.	Usenokuba ngoku.
Or almost, of course.	Okanye phantse, kunjalo.
Not just outside but inside.	Hayi nje ngaphandle kodwa ngaphakathi.
All the time, really.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, ngokwenene.
Now, and always.	Ngoku, kwaye rhoqo.
How will it look to me.	Iza kubonakala njani kum.
I'm starting now.	Ndiyaqala ngoku.
He got food.	Wafumana ukutya.
The thinking seemed slow.	Ukucinga kwakubonakala ngathi kuhamba kancinci.
And there is no reason.	Kwaye akukho sizathu.
If you are successful.	Ukuba uphumelele.
I wanted to tell you that.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela lonto.
But the test, yes.	Kodwa uvavanyo, ewe.
As we will find out.	Njengoko siza kufumana.
Any place is fine.	Nayiphi na indawo ilungile.
And they stayed there all day.	Bahlala ke imini yonke.
He gave me help.	Wandinika uncedo.
But he never spoke again.	Kodwa akazange aphinde athethe.
I can't say anything about it.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto ngayo.
I wanted to say a few things to this.	Bendifuna ukuthetha izinto ezimbalwa kule nto.
I am looking after my son.	Ndijonge unyana wam.
I'm sure you know that.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi loo nto.
Because you should.	Kuba ufanele.
We will do what we will do.	Siza kwenza le nto siza kuyenza.
I really went too far.	Ndihambe kakhulu nyani.
Down with whatever.	Phantsi nokuba yintoni na.
But she could not think of that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukucinga ngaloo nto.
He probably ran out of the house.	Inokuba wabaleka waphuma endlini.
And that is really hard.	Kwaye oko kunzima ngokwenene.
Except for me.	Ngaphandle kwam nje.
He wanted to know for sure.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
But not in this one.	Kodwa hayi kule.
And you think about.	Kwaye ucinga malunga.
If you think before you speak or act.	Ukuba ucinga ngaphambi kokuba uthethe okanye wenze.
There is no question there.	Akukho mbuzo apho.
I would like that.	Ndingathanda ukuba njalo.
I did not know which one.	Bendingazi ukuba yeyiphi.
It could be tonight.	Inokuba ngokuhlwanje.
That's just hard.	Kunzima nje oko.
Do not work hard.	Musa ukusebenza nzima.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiyo kanye loo nto.
She went to school.	Waya esikolweni.
It's all up to us.	Konke kuthi.
Well, that's what you need to do.	Ewe, yiloo nto ekufuneka uyenzile.
He likes to make friends.	Uyathanda ukwenza abahlobo.
We know for sure.	Oko siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Many people say that he is.	Abantu abaninzi bathi nguye.
Good to see.	Kuhle ukubona.
So, this happens.	Ngoko, oku kwenzeka.
He drives regularly.	Uqhuba rhoqo.
He would have to try again.	Bekuya kufuneka azame kwakhona.
In his house.	Endlini yakhe.
And this time you are sure.	Kwaye ngeli xesha uqinisekile.
We will all continue together in one way or another.	Sonke siya kuqhubeka kunye ngendlela enye okanye enye.
Every day, three days.	Yonke imini, iintsuku ezintathu.
One of us, then.	Omnye wethu, ngoko.
If this, then.	Ukuba oku, ngoko ke.
I just wanted you to know.	Bendifuna wazi nje.
I went to her house.	Ndaya kwakhe.
In the end, he did.	Ekugqibeleni, wayenza.
He went right in there.	Wangena kanye apho.
Except maybe himself.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi ngokwakhe.
Or do we.	Okanye senze.
Or you don't want to.	Okanye awufuni.
It has to be fast.	Kufuneka kube ngokukhawuleza.
People have, you know.	Abantu baye, uyazi.
So it is difficult.	Ngoko ke kunzima.
You have made a decision.	Uyenzile isigqibo.
I think the same way.	Ndicinga ngendlela efanayo.
It seems so.	Kubonakala kunjalo.
He wondered about that, too.	Wazibuza ngaloo nto, naye.
See if it's right.	Jonga ukuba ilungile na.
He expects me to be there.	Ulindele ukuba ndibe lapho.
Maybe it's better.	Mhlawumbi kungcono.
Every little mistake.	Yonke impazamo encinci.
There is no time to do that.	Akukho xesha lokwenza oko.
He has been there ever since.	Uhlale apho ukusukela ngoko.
There must be a book about it.	Kumele ukuba kukho incwadi malunga nayo.
Yes, that means you.	Ewe, oko kuthetha wena.
With something to do.	Ngento yokwenza.
Maybe that's why he did so well.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto enze kakuhle kangaka.
Nobody wants to have it.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba nayo.
That's all.	Yiyo kuphela.
He did not admit that there was anything wrong with me.	Zange avume ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngam.
And it looks like you have that.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi unayo loo nto.
That's the only way.	Yiloo ndlela kuphela.
Time with me and my kids.	Ixesha kunye nam nabantwana bam.
You think you'd better do it with me then.	Ucinga ukuba kungcono uyenze kunye nam ke.
Now it seems that they will succeed.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi baza kuphumelela.
Home again, now.	Ekhaya kwakhona, ngoku.
And then his whole life.	Kwaye emva koko ubomi bakhe bonke.
If you want one.	Ukuba ufuna enye.
Not too much for me.	Hayi kakhulu ukuhamba kum.
It's so nice to be there.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuhlala apho.
Another way to do it.	Enye indlela yokwenza.
Not his phone.	Hayi umnxeba wakhe.
But he did not know that.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba.
I'll come to that now.	Ndiza kuza kuloo nto ngoku.
This should be here, that should be.	Oku kufuneka kube apha, oko kufuneka kube khona.
He left the house and went alone.	Waphuma endlini wahamba yedwa.
His eyes were never human.	Amehlo akhe akazange abe ngumntu.
He looked at the office.	Wajonga eofisini.
That's how he come here.	Weza ngolo hlobo ke apha.
Not back.	Hayi emva .
Coming out tonight.	Ukuphuma ngokuhlwanje.
This will go a long way.	Oku kuya kude kakhulu.
I think you love her.	Ndicinga ukuba uyamthanda.
Tell me where you are going.	Ndixelele ukuba uye phi.
But again there was nothing to him like that.	Kodwa kwakhona kwakungekho nto kuye ngolo hlobo.
There was no return.	Kwakungekho kubuya.
I'm not sure there is anything wrong.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho into embi.
All of his work can be painful.	Umsebenzi wakhe wonke unokuba buhlungu.
This is not the case at the moment.	Oku akunjalo okwangoku.
If you do, you will be able to speak.	Ukuba wenze njalo uya kukwazi ukuthetha.
He did not say this.	Akazange athethe oku.
However, it is much harder to play than you think it is.	Nangona kunjalo, kunzima kakhulu ukudlala kunokuba ucinga ukuba kunjalo.
Therefore, it is not.	Ngoko ke, akunjalo.
He just went with it.	Wahamba nayo nje.
You have to come with me.	Kufuneka uze nawe.
I can't do anything alone.	Andikwazi ukwenza nto ndedwa.
There is so much more this week.	Kukho okuninzi kule veki.
But if you have not done so.	Kodwa ukuba awuzange wenze njalo.
Because it is only possible.	Ngenxa yokuba kunokwenzeka kuphela.
It's not your thing.	Asiyonto yakho.
Your wife, it's hard.	Umfazi wakho, kunzima.
Thank you for doing that.	Enkosi ngokwenza oko.
I have to talk about it.	Kufuneka ndithethe ngayo.
I tried to stop thinking about it.	Ndazama ukuyeka ukucinga ngayo.
It should be easy, though.	Kufuneka kube lula, nangona kunjalo.
He can't get enough.	Akakwazi kufumana ngokwaneleyo.
Either way, you will not be good.	Nokuba yintoni na, awuyi kuba ulungile.
He saw his father in the car.	Wabona utata wakhe emotweni.
There is peace here.	Kukho uxolo apha.
To walk means to walk.	Ukuhamba kuthetha ukuhamba.
I'm just a human being, you know.	Ndingumntu nje, uyazi.
That too should happen sooner or later.	Naloo nto kufuneka yenzeke kungekudala okanye kamva.
Now we know.	Ngoku siyazi.
Now this.	Ngoku le.
At first he did not know where he was.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi ukuba uphi.
It will be strange.	Kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
He wants to build.	Ufuna ukuba akhe.
I know that because you are scared.	Ndiyayazi lonto kuba uyoyika.
That's what happened to me.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo kum.
He sat in the car.	Wahlala emotweni.
I thought maybe you could too.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhlawumbi nawe usenokuba .
I don't really know what's going on.	Andazi ngenene ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
And that soon.	Kwaye oko kungekudala.
I know it's nothing, but it is.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho nto, kodwa kunjalo.
Besides, he knew.	Ngaphandle koko, wayesazi.
To this afternoon.	Kude kube namhlanje emva kwemini.
And you will want more.	Kwaye uya kufuna okuninzi.
Now there is something.	Ngoku kukho into.
He looked at another woman.	Wajonga omnye umfazi.
I will do anything.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na.
The police arrived.	Amapolisa afike.
I do not understand what the problem is here.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni ingxaki apha.
I do not want to stay.	Andifuni kuhlala.
He also looked around the room.	Naye wajonga egumbini.
Good to see this.	Kuhle ukubona oku.
You certainly don't think !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awucingi!.
Everything is fine with me.	Konke kuhle ngam.
Not only that, everywhere.	Akunjalo nje, kuyo yonke indawo.
I'm waiting for his response.	Ndilinde impendulo yakhe.
So immediately.	Ngoko ke ngoko nangoko.
But I'm not sure how I did it.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani.
Or don't do it.	Okanye musa ukwenza.
There is something very strange about it.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga kakhulu ngayo.
If this is possible.	Ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
Then he started talking to me.	Emva koko waqalisa ukuthetha nam.
Death must happen after that.	Ukufa kufuneka kwenzeke emva koko.
So what.	Ngoko yintoni na.
I am the reason why.	Ndim isizathu sokuba.
If he wanted to have a party.	Ukuba wayefuna ukwenza itheko.
He has to tell me what to do.	Kufuneka andixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
That and that.	Oko kwaye kuphela.
Finally, he opened the door.	Ekugqibeleni, wavula ucango.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange abe nayo.
It’s hard to really tell.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngokwenene.
And they will.	Kwaye baya kwenza njalo.
I will go.	Ndiza kuhamba.
This is not just about you.	Oku akukho malunga nawe kuphela.
I just do it and that’s it.	Ndenza nje kwaye yiloo nto.
If you want something done, you have to make it happen.	Ukuba ufuna into yenziwe, kufuneka uyenze yenzeke.
This will go well.	Oku kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
I am with you.	Ndim nawe.
You don't even think you're good.	Awucingi nokuba ulungile.
This is especially true in this case.	Oku kunjalo ngakumbi kule meko.
Others.	Abanye.
Window to the front.	Ifestile ukuya ngaphambili.
I do not know sorry.	Andazi uxolo.
Or with us.	Okanye kunye nathi.
And he went there.	Waya apho ke.
But then she wondered if it was really so.	Kodwa emva koko wazibuza ukuba ngaba ngokwenene kunjalo.
Thank you so much for everything you need to do.	Enkosi kakhulu ngayo yonke into ekufuneka uyenzile.
Long enough, however, for something else to happen.	Ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo, nangona kunjalo, ukuba kwenzeke enye into.
You've been here all your life.	Ulapha ubomi bakho bonke.
I can't say why now.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni ngoku.
He didn't know what that might be.	Wayengazi ukuba inokuba yintoni na loo nto.
And somewhere.	Kwaye kwindawo ethile.
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
We'll try this afternoon.	Siza kuzama ngale njikalanga.
I wanted to leave since then.	Bendifuna ukuhamba ukusukela ngoko.
Well, tell me about it.	Ke, ndixelele ngayo.
Yeah, maybe really now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ngokwenene ngoku.
We both want the same thing.	Sobabini sifuna into enye.
Then do better.	Emva koko wenze ngcono.
Today maybe not.	Namhlanje mhlawumbi akunjalo.
This one, he's the only one.	Lo, nguye yedwa.
Or maybe he did it but he never told me.	Okanye mhlawumbi wenze ngayo kodwa akazange andixelele.
Tom, he thought.	UTom, wacinga.
But okay, okay.	Kodwa kulungile, kulungile.
The fact is, it could have been.	Inyaniso kukuba, inokuba njalo.
All that time.	Lonke elo xesha.
So, you know.	Ukuze, uyazi.
The problem is this.	Ingxaki yile.
I am new to this.	Ndingumntu omtsha kule nto.
You don't know what's wrong.	Awuyazi into embi.
This was nothing.	Oku kwakungekho nto.
There may be others.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba bakho abanye.
I'm tired of you.	Ndidiniwe nguwe.
You know this.	Oku uyazi.
I look forward and look down.	Ndijonge phambili ndijonge phantsi.
I mean that's true.	Ndithetha ukuba yinyani leyo.
I don't know what happened.	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I live at home and make music.	Ndihlala ekhaya ndenze umculo.
Well, nowhere, of course.	Ewe, akukho ndawo, kunjalo.
And, that's exactly what happened.	Kwaye, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Wait me.	Ndilinde mna.
But give me a letter.	Kodwa ndinike ileta.
Something very unusual happened at that time.	Kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga ngoko.
He gave me a man.	Wandinika umntu.
He too was not alone.	Naye yayingenguye yedwa.
This is possible now.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngoku.
This will do.	Oku kuya kwenza.
But you never knew.	Kodwa awuzange wazi.
It is unlikely that he will stay long, however.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba ahlale ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
Then he came in and told me the whole story.	Wangena ke wandixelela lonke ibali.
So, please.	Ngoko, nceda.
Two methods are needed.	Kufuneka indlela ezimbini.
This is not possible, but it is, indeed, true.	Oku akunakwenzeka, kodwa kunjalo, kunjalo ngokwenene.
He can do this.	Angayenza le nto.
For now, it is not.	Okwangoku, akunjalo.
I want you in the office.	Ndifuna wena eofisini.
You need to tell me now.	Kufuneka undixelele ngoku.
Only you and me.	Mna nawe kuphela.
Well, that's it for me.	Kulungile, yiloo nto kum.
It is good to do it once in a while though.	Kuhle ukwenza kube kanye ngexesha nangona kunjalo.
It's clearly wrong.	Yinto engalunganga ngokucacileyo.
I must be tired, she thought.	Inokuba ndidiniwe, wacinga.
He did not want to eat.	Wayengafuni kutya.
Then he went to work.	Emva koko waya emsebenzini.
You have been waiting a long time.	Ulinde ixesha elide.
Getting a lot of attention now.	Ukufumana ingqalelo eninzi ngoku.
I don't know about him.	Andazi ngaye.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ayizange yenzeke into enje.
Down with anything.	Phantsi nantoni na.
But he would do it.	Kodwa wayeza kuyenza.
I did I did.	Ndenze ndenza.
That is happening now.	Oko kwenzeka ngoku.
I think it's just true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani nje.
So there is no need to do it.	Ngoko ke akukho mfuneko yokwenza.
No one ever gave me anything.	Akukho mntu wakha wandinika nantoni na.
But this one will last a long time.	Kodwa le iya kuhlala ixesha elide.
He said he knew that.	Wathi uyayazi lonto.
People everywhere.	Abantu kuyo yonke indawo.
I know him to be just a man.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ungumntu nje.
He refused to stay in that.	Akazange avume ukuhlala kuloo nto.
So we'll see what happens.	Ngoko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
However, it is not the only way.	Nangona kunjalo, ayisiyiyo kuphela indlela.
Certainly the day will soon come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kufika imini kungekudala.
I actually heard something there.	Ngenene ndeva into apho.
Such a place.	Indawo enjalo.
I know you well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle nawe.
But they will buy.	Kodwa baya kuthenga.
Not when you go.	Hayi xa uhamba.
I will want to know why.	Ndiza kufuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Well, maybe it would.	Ewe, mhlawumbi bekuya kuba njalo.
And at that time there was music.	Kwaye ngelo xesha kukho umculo.
Again, this could be me.	Kwakhona, oku kunokuba ndim.
You will be fine alone.	Uza kuba kakuhle yedwa.
I did for a long time, though.	Ndenza ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
Book though.	Incwadi nangona.
I did not know that you were the one sitting here.	Bendingayazi ukuba nguwe lo uhleli apha.
His mother is a person, and all of us.	Umama wakhe ngumntu, nathi sonke.
We want to get out and do our job.	Sifuna ukuphuma siye kwenza umsebenzi wethu.
He will speak a word.	Uya kuthetha ilizwi.
She could not help but wonder what would happen to her.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
After a while you know that.	Emva kwexesha uyayazi loo nto.
You want him to be like you.	Ufuna ukuba abe njengawe.
Why and why not.	Kutheni kutheni kutheni.
And if he lived at home.	Kwaye ukuba wayehlala ekhaya.
He did well for her.	Wenza kakuhle kuye.
It’s that you don’t have to be.	Kukuba akuyomfuneko ukuba ube.
What he wants is his job.	Into ayifunayo ngumsebenzi wakhe.
But then again, nothing happened.	Kodwa kwakhona, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
It's hard to make money.	Kunzima ukufumana imali.
That's the way we do things.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo izinto.
I said nothing about it.	Khange ndithethe nto ngayo.
That will be a long time ago.	Oko kuya kuba kudala.
He was very scared now.	Wayesoyika kakhulu ngoku.
How about this.	Njani ngale nto.
I want to do better.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono.
I would like to work again.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza kwakhona.
He had to think of a plan.	Kwafuneka acinge icebo.
And no one is doing this.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza oku.
But like you can read my mind.	Kodwa ngathi uyakwazi ukufunda ingqondo yam.
Sorry, totally my case.	Uxolo, ngokupheleleyo ityala lam.
I thought everyone would get a chance at this.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uza kufumana ithuba kule nto.
You want the truth.	Ufuna inyaniso.
All of this comes later.	Konke oku kuza emva kwexesha.
I thought everything was fine.	Bendicinga ukuba konke kulungile.
That's his thing.	Nantso into yakhe.
No one really knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into ngenene.
I'm waiting outside.	Ndilinde ngaphandle.
We need to get away, quickly.	Kufuneka siye kude, ngokukhawuleza.
And then, he thought, it was impossible.	Kwaye ke, wacinga ukuba, akunakwenzeka.
He must have fallen asleep at last.	Umele ukuba walala ekugqibeleni.
Here, no one.	Apha, akukho mntu.
I don't even know where he lived or how.	Andazi nam ukuba wayehlala phi, okanye njani.
And his permission.	Kwaye imvume yakhe.
That is it.	Yiyo lento.
But then he spoke.	Kodwa emva koko wathetha.
And maybe there is truth in it.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kukho inyani kuyo.
He wants to take everyone with you.	Ufuna ukuthatha wonke umntu ahambe nawe.
He can never do any of that.	Akanakuze enze nayiphi na kuloo nto.
It’s just a thing for me.	Yinto nje into kum.
He didn't want to play at all.	Wayengafuni kwaphela ukudlala.
Tell me one thing, though.	Ndixelele into enye, nangona kunjalo.
I love it, I love it, I love it.	Ndiyayithanda, ndiyayithanda, ndiyayithanda.
I wanted to see more.	Ndandifuna ukubona ngakumbi.
Thank you so much for this.	Enkosi kakhulu ngale.
I can go home.	Ndiyakwazi ukuya ekhaya.
I think faster than you.	Ndicinga ngokukhawuleza kunawe.
And, finally, do not take my word for it.	Kwaye, ekugqibeleni, musa ukuthatha ilizwi lam kuyo.
And it has happened.	Kwaye kuye kwenzeka.
Please, help me.	Nceda, ndincede.
Only to have him.	Kuphela ukuba ube naye.
I want to do it.	Ndifuna ukuyenza.
He asked about her at school.	Wabuza ngaye esikolweni.
He wanted to get out.	Wayefuna ukuphuma phandle.
Such a wonderful story.	Ibali elihle kangaka.
He made money.	Wenza imali.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo.
He stepped back for a long time.	Wangena ngasemva ixesha elide.
No, they finally went to him.	Hayi, ekugqibeleni baya kuye.
He did not know why and did not need to know.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni kwaye kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba azi.
I just wanted to talk right away.	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha ngoko nangoko.
Because he loves her.	Kuba uyamthanda.
But you know right away.	Kodwa wazi ngoko nangoko.
I will go with you.	Ndiza kuhamba nawe.
That's a bad thing to do.	Yinto embi leyo ukuyenza.
And I hope you get better.	Kwaye ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuba ngcono.
But to be there.	Kodwa ukuba khona.
Your people because of you.	Abantu bakho ngenxa yakho.
And you don't know it better.	Kwaye awuyazi ngcono.
Look at the error.	Jonga impazamo.
It's hard to do that now.	Kunzima ukwenza oko ngoku.
So he needs to know.	Ngoko kufuneka azi.
Or, more importantly, it is not.	Okanye, ngakumbi, akunjalo.
Thanks for doing.	Enkosi kuba senze.
That's what you did.	Yiyo loo nto uyenzile.
This is good to see.	Oku kuhle ukubona.
All too much.	Konke kakhulu.
But there is another.	Kodwa kukho enye.
No one is coming to you.	Akukho mntu uza kuwe.
She can eat.	Uyakwazi ukutya.
Only this and that and now.	Kuphela oku kwaye apha kwaye ngoku.
Not ours, but the wait.	Hayi wethu, kodwa ukulinda.
I want to eat this food.	Ndifuna ukutya oku kutya.
You do not want to.	Awufuni.
We want it done now.	Sifuna yenziwe ngoku.
He did what he could.	Wenza okusemandleni akhe.
You're right after that.	Ulungile emva koko.
I just told you.	Ndikuxelele nje.
He works alone.	Usebenza yedwa.
You may even like him.	Usenokuba uyamthanda.
Then he went and built.	Emva koko waya wakha.
He read everything there.	Wafunda yonke into apho.
But they say so.	Kodwa bathi kunjalo.
It will stay there a long time.	Iza kuhlala ixesha elide apho.
Does it really seem like you think so.	Ngaba ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi ucinga njalo.
? 	?
I know exactly where you are going with this.	Ndiyazi kakuhle apho uya khona ngale nto.
But only.	Kodwa kuphela.
But do you, as he does.	Kodwa ngaba uyayenza, njengokuba esenza.
You will be in the background.	Uya kuba ngasemva.
And he never left.	Kwaye akazange ahambe.
How much you mean to me.	Uthetha kangakanani kum.
I think both.	Ndicinga ukuba bobabini.
I love it, too.	Ndiyayithanda, nam.
Now or never, he thought.	Ngoku okanye zange, wacinga.
This is for me.	Oku kum.
I can quickly see that something is wrong.	Ndiyakwazi ukubona ngokukhawuleza ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
Probably that.	Mhlawumbi ukuba .
Finally he decided to come.	Ekugqibeleni wagqiba kwelokuba eze.
I have to wait more time.	Kufuneka ndilinde ixesha elingakumbi.
See if you need advice or something.	Jonga ukuba ufuna icebiso okanye into ethile.
Soon now, man will do just that.	Kungekudala ngoku, umntu uya kwenza njalo.
I really want to do this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza le nto.
Please do better.	Nceda wenze ngcono.
He looked at the other side slightly.	Wajonga omnye ecaleni kancinci.
So out.	Ngoko ke ngaphandle.
It has to be done, it has to be done.	Kufuneka yenziwe, kufuneka yenziwe.
You feel like you are eating lunch.	Uziva ngathi utya isidlo sasemini.
Even just a day.	Nokuba nje imini.
I never went anywhere.	Andizange ndiye ndawo.
He walked right in front of you.	Wahamba kanye phambi kwakho.
It seemed obvious to me.	Kwakubonakala kucacile kum.
He never did.	Zange ayenze.
He is here with her.	Ulapha naye.
That happens more than you think.	Oko kwenzeka ngaphezu kokuba ucinga.
Or if you have ever eaten.	Okanye ukuba ukhe watya.
He wants it to be for you.	Ufuna ukuba kube kuwe.
Although she didn't look as good as I was.	Nangona wayengabonakali mhle njengam.
If he did not do well.	Ukuba akenzanga kakuhle.
So, thank you.	Ngoko, enkosi.
If you do, you do it.	Ukuba uyayenza, uyayenza.
Because he speaks well, he really does.	Ngenxa yokuba uthetha kakuhle, wenza ngokwenene.
I wish you came too.	Ndinqwenela ukuba nawe uze.
You have spoken, but not to me.	Ukhe wathetha, kodwa hayi kum.
I did not see anything.	Khange ndibone nto.
And so it is with us.	Kwaye kunjalo nathi.
I think he should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
My son is looking for a job.	Unyana wam ufuna umsebenzi.
Just, there is no time.	Nje, akukho xesha.
Then there is no waiting.	Emva koko akukho kulinda.
Next week soon enough.	Iveki ezayo kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
I can't think of another one right now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngenye okwangoku.
And it is very well done.	Kwaye yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu.
No one should have to think that.	Akukho mntu kufuneka acinge oko.
It will be difficult.	Kuza kuba nzima.
My new book.	Incwadi yam entsha.
She goes to work.	Uya emsebenzini.
I don't really want to talk about it.	Andifuni nyani ukuthetha ngayo.
He would try again.	Wayeza kuzama kwakhona.
He did it well.	Wayenza loo nto kakuhle.
To make it even more fun.	Ukwenza kube mnandi ngakumbi.
I'm sure of that now.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto ngoku.
Or have it in the back.	Okanye ube nayo ngasemva.
I did not want to do this alone.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza ndedwa le nto.
Everywhere there.	Yonke indawo apho.
Very nice up there.	Kuhle kakhulu phaya phezulu.
He only acted like us.	Wenza ngathi kuphela.
Or say no.	Okanye uthi hayi.
But he has never been able to do this before.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza le nto ngaphambili.
But he did not tell anyone.	Kodwa akazange axelele bani.
He knew the reason.	Wayesazi isizathu.
But even though this can be very high.	Kodwa nangona oku kunokuba phezulu kakhulu.
He didn't have to think about it.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba acinge ngayo.
But nobody could walk.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakwazi ukuhamba.
Then he thought again.	Emva koko wacinga kwakhona.
He should sit down and talk to us.	Kufuneka ahlale phantsi athethe nathi.
This person is not me.	Lo mntu ayindim.
He got some very good advice on that.	Wafumana icebiso elihle kakhulu kuloo nto.
But the man was afraid.	Kodwa lo mntu wayesoyika.
Well done, this job.	Ndenze kakuhle, lo msebenzi.
Really doing just about anything.	Ngokwenene ukwenza malunga nantoni na.
This takes time.	Oku kufuna ixesha.
Or everything.	Okanye yonke into.
I wanted books.	Ndandifuna iincwadi.
I think it is now.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo ngoku.
And there he is.	Kwaye ukhona.
Exactly, now.	Kanye ngokwenene, ngoku.
Sounds good now.	Kubonakala kulungile ngoku.
He plans to leave soon.	Uceba ukuhamba kungekudala.
She is dressed.	Unxibe.
And as you go, it's good to look back.	Kwaye njengoko uhamba, kulungile ukuba ujonge ngasemva.
I had to think about this.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngale nto.
But you didn't, you decided on your own.	Kodwa awuzange, wenze isigqibo wedwa.
He knew it well.	Wayesazi kakuhle.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo kanye.
Or a whole week.	Okanye iveki yonke.
Everyone except you knows that you feel the same way about you.	Wonke umntu ngaphandle kwakho uyazi ukuba uziva ngendlela efanayo ngawe.
So, he took someone else.	Ngoko, wathatha omnye umntu.
Or my life.	Okanye ubomi bam.
But he wanted alcohol.	Kodwa wayefuna utywala.
You can control yourself.	Uyakwazi ukuzibamba.
But this is also very difficult to do.	Kodwa oku kwakhona kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Too much money to play.	Imali eninzi kakhulu yokudlala.
I love the way he did it.	Ndiyayithanda indlela ayenze ngayo.
I said nothing to her.	Khange ndithethe enye into kuye.
I don't know who made it.	Andazi ukuba yenziwe ngubani.
We will stay here.	Siza kuhlala apha.
Maybe also true.	Mhlawumbi kwakhona yinyani.
Is.	Ngaba.
I finally did my homework.	Ekugqibeleni ndenze umsebenzi wesikolo.
I know you have it in you.	Ndiyazi ukuba unayo kuwe.
They still live there.	Bahlala apho nangoku.
He thought someone knew.	Wayecinga ukuba omnye uyazi.
If everyone did.	Ukuba wonke umntu wenza njalo.
I have become an actor.	Ndibe ngumdlali.
Everyone is a person.	Wonke umntu ngumntu.
John was not present.	UYohane wayengekho.
He does not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba enjenjalo.
His performance.	Ukwenza kwakhe.
It wasn't really him.	Yayingenguye ngokwenene.
And so this.	Kwaye ngoko oku.
My mother never spoke again.	Umama akazange aphinde athethe.
I have to tell you the truth.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele inyani.
It will get things.	Iya kufumana izinto.
He never wanted to do that again.	Akazange aphinde afune ukuyenza loo nto.
And right at the top.	Kwaye kanye phezulu .
It has to happen.	Kufuneka yenzeke.
Work will wait.	Umsebenzi uya kulinda.
So you have probably done the right thing.	Ngoko usenokuba wenze into elungileyo.
But only once.	Kodwa kube kanye kuphela.
Everything else is fine.	Yonke enye into ilungile.
Nobody tells you that.	Akukho mntu ukuxelela loo nto.
Maybe it will be fun.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba mnandi.
It seems better that way.	Kubonakala kungcono ngolo hlobo.
There seemed to be something small in everything.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kukho into encinci kuyo yonke into.
Or night as it is.	Okanye ubusuku njengoko kunjalo.
I do not know why this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oku.
You did something wrong.	Wenze into engalunganga.
Not a small thing.	Hayi into encinci.
I'm sorry it isn't.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba akunjalo.
But he would succeed.	Kodwa wayeza kuphumelela.
No one wanted to make money.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza imali.
I wanted to see my wife before dinner.	Bendifuna ukubona umfazi wam phambi kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
I doubt strong.	Ndiyathandabuza ngamandla.
But your people.	Kodwa abantu bakho.
He hoped to stay there.	Wayenethemba lokuba uya kuhlala apho.
But he decided to give it a try.	Kodwa wagqiba kwelokuba azame.
I'm sure it's not hard to find one there.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho nzima ukufumana enye phaya.
You do better and better.	Wenza ngcono kwaye ngcono.
I'll be there.	Ndiza kuba lapho.
Nothing about you yet.	Akukho nto ngawe okwangoku.
If only time.	Ukuba kuphela ixesha.
But he did well.	Kodwa wenza kakuhle.
I thought she was going to get better.	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba ngcono.
Cat, probably.	Ikati, mhlawumbi.
Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.	Hayi ngomso, hayi kwiveki ezayo, kodwa namhlanje.
It does not have to happen immediately.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke kwangoko.
Trying to do too much at one time or another may be difficult.	Ukuzama ukwenza into eninzi ngexesha elinye kunokuba nzima.
It happens mostly in the office.	Kwenzeka kakhulu eofisini.
No one works hard.	Akukho mntu usebenza nzima.
And you can do it, too.	Kwaye ungayenza, nawe.
This is likely to be simple.	Oku kunokwenzeka ukuba kube lula.
I had to go again.	Kwafuneka ndihambe kwakhona.
Here, there was nothing.	Apha, kwakungekho nto.
Everything we need to know.	Yonke into ekufuneka siyazi.
Not just his wife.	Hayi nje umfazi wakhe.
Not my thing.	Hayi into yam.
And it is coming.	Kwaye kuza.
Obviously he says no.	Ngokucacileyo uthi hayi.
What's worse.	Into embi ngakumbi.
A little bit, no.	Kancinci kancinci, hayi.
I want all the truth.	Ndifuna yonke inyaniso.
Very well done indeed.	Yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu ngenene.
However, this requires a lot of work.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kufuna ukusebenza okuninzi.
He had to stop talking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukuthetha.
Is that you?.	Ingaba nguwe?.
That's all right.	Nto leyo ilungile kwaphela.
And, he knew he had to do it right away.	Kwaye, wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ayenze ngokukhawuleza.
So, he is.	Ngoko, nguye.
So we will do that.	Ngoko ke siya kwenza loo nto.
It can only be a good thing.	Inokuba yinto entle kuphela.
At the same time.	Ngexesha elinye.
I just didn't want a book.	Ndandingafuni ncwadi nje.
But he looks good.	Kodwa ukhangeleka kakuhle.
He said he couldn't get out of there fast enough.	Wathi akakwazi ukuphuma apho ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
And you want more.	Kwaye ufuna ngakumbi.
Then everything will repeat.	Emva koko yonke into iya kuphinda.
Her father did not.	Utata wakhe akazange.
She is here right now.	Ukhona okwangoku.
But we will talk about that later.	Kodwa siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
I'm scared, almost.	Ndiyoyika, phantse.
I didn’t see much of it in my area.	Andizange ndibone okuninzi kuyo kwindawo yam.
That's the answer now.	Nantso impendulo ngoku.
He got into bed and lay down.	Wangena ebhedini walala.
I will not go easy.	Andiyi kuhamba lula.
But that will take time.	Kodwa oko kuya kuthatha ixesha.
But even me.	Kodwa nangona mna .
I really doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza ngokwenene.
You think this is a good thing.	Ucinga ukuba yinto entle le.
Not since last night, maybe.	Hayi ukusukela phezolo, mhlawumbi.
It's all done now.	Yenziwe yonke ngoku.
And he was going to leave soon, he knew.	Kwaye wayeza kuhamba kungekudala, wayesazi.
It is difficult to work together.	Kunzima ukusebenza kunye.
I'll have to think about that later.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto kamva.
He tried two.	Wazama ezimbini.
You will have to go to work.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba uye emsebenzini.
However, who is this person.	Nangona kunjalo, ngubani lo mntu.
Yeah, right away.	Ewe, kwangoko.
So that will do it.	Ngoko oko kuya kukwenza.
But we want everyone to succeed.	Kodwa sifuna wonke umntu ukuba siya kuphumelela.
Not too far away really.	Hayi kude kakhulu ngenene.
They both live together.	Bobabini bahlala kunye.
She’s definitely ready to get home, though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukulungele ukufika ekhaya, nangona kunjalo.
Now we know that is not the case.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
It will be a good thing.	Iza kuba yinto entle.
I do my thing.	Ndenza into yam.
I never told you this.	Andizange ndikuxelele oku.
Good father.	Utata olungileyo.
He was hoping something bad would happen.	Wayenethemba lokuba kuya kwenzeka into embi.
It was not difficult.	Khange kube nzima.
He tried, though.	Wazama, nangona kunjalo.
No, no, that's fine.	Hayi, hayi, ilungile loo nto.
So he had to move on.	Ngoko kwafuneka aye phambili.
Unless you're talking about something else.	Ngaphandle kokuba uthetha ngenye into.
But he will not go.	Kodwa akayi kuhamba.
And it will hurt me.	Kwaye kuya kuba buhlungu kum.
Well, that's me, he thought.	Ewe, ndim lowo, wacinga.
It almost never happened to me.	Phantse engazange yenzeke kum.
She is very interesting and intelligent.	Unomdla kakhulu kwaye ukrelekrele.
Probably even painful.	Mhlawumbi nokuba buhlungu.
Then he had to leave.	Emva koko kwafuneka ahambe.
You have to go too.	Nawe kufuneka uhambe.
Not death.	Hayi ukufa.
But he could not do much.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza okuninzi.
I know this is hard to find.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kunzima ukufumana.
And it immediately speaks volumes.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza kuthetha ngokukhawuleza.
He did not want to be in this place.	Wayengafuni ukuba kule ndawo.
You did everything well.	Wenze yonke into kakuhle.
But everywhere there is nothing.	Kodwa kuyo yonke indawo akukho nto.
No one comes to him.	Akukho mntu uza kuye.
He works hard for us.	Usebenza nzima ngenxa yethu.
I never thought this would happen.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
It's just being here.	Kukuba lapha nje.
I have not been there for a long time.	Andizange ndibe khona ixesha elide.
You should go to a doctor immediately.	Kufuneka uhambe uye kufuna ugqirha ngokukhawuleza.
Because, because, because.	Ngokuba, ngokuba, ngokuba.
I'm trying to think now.	Ndizama ukucinga ngoku.
He looked at the reading.	Wajonga ukufunda.
I heard then.	Ndive ke.
I have to tell you then.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ke.
Not somewhere.	Hayi kwindawo ethile.
He never lived in the city.	Akazange ahlale edolophini.
He was less visible before.	Wayengabonakali kangako ngaphambili.
Surely, he wanted to be his friend.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wayefuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
Good, of course.	Mhle, kunjalo.
But that takes time.	Kodwa oko kuthatha ixesha.
And always every day.	Kwaye njalo yonke imihla.
That's my way.	Nantso indlela yam.
He made it happen.	Wayenza ukuba yenzeke.
I’m not sure what’s going on, or what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni, okanye ukwenza ntoni.
You do not have to tell me you are tired.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba undixelele ukuba udiniwe.
Good for him, though.	Kuhle kuye, nangona kunjalo.
Sorry he knew.	Uxolo wayesazi.
I don’t really see how it can hurt anything.	Andiboni nyani ukuba inokuba buhlungu nantoni na.
You know, you don't even have to do this.	Uyazi, akunyanzelekanga nokuba wenze oku.
I'm sure it would be.	Ndiqinisekile bekuya kuba njalo.
Everyone is here, in one place.	Wonke umntu ulapha, kwindawo enye.
I'm really glad for you.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ngenxa yakho.
No one had ever seen such a thing.	Akukho mntu wabona into enjalo.
So far, no problem.	Kude kube ngoku, akukho ngxaki.
But this can be difficult.	Kodwa oku kunokuba nzima.
Sounds good enough.	Kubonakala kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
No one asked me to do it.	Akukho mntu wandicela ukuba ndiyenze.
You have to be successful, and successful, and successful.	Kufuneka uphumelele, kwaye uphumelele, kwaye uphumelele.
Let me say this.	Makhe ndithethe oku.
And maybe.	Kwaye mhlawumbi .
We've done all this before.	Senze konke oku ngaphambili.
He had to go now.	Kwafuneka ahambe ngoku.
You represent the people.	Umele abantu.
Lunch with friends.	Isidlo sasemini kunye nabahlobo.
He is the one you need to talk to.	Nguye ekufuneka uthethe naye.
This means.	Oku kuthetha .
Slowly he looked up.	Kancinci wajonga phezulu.
I hope you did.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenze njalo.
It would certainly be good to get help.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba kuhle ukufumana uncedo.
Everyone tries to do his best.	Wonke umntu uzama ukwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
And he did something about it.	Waza wenza into ngaloo nto.
I look forward, not backward.	Ndijonge phambili, hayi ngasemva.
True to anything new.	Yinyani kuyo nantoni na entsha.
Or nobody.	Okanye akukho mntu.
But now he will stay.	Kodwa ngoku uya kuhlala.
He went to college, and he lives there now.	Uye waya ekholejini, kwaye uhlala khona ngoku.
However, it should not be a pain.	Nangona kunjalo, akufanele kube buhlungu.
This morning .	Namhlanje ekuseni .
My mother did it, too.	Umama uyenzile, naye.
There is that situation.	Kukho loo meko.
I decided on that.	Ndagqiba kuloo nto.
Once again at home.	Kwakhona kube kanye ekhaya.
He came to her, saying something.	Weza kuye, ethetha into.
Then we will come back.	Emva koko siya kubuya.
There is something else you need to do.	Kukho enye into ekufuneka uyenzile.
I can't talk to you right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nawe ngoku.
But his departure did not go well.	Kodwa ukuhamba kwakhe akuzange kube kuhle.
He felt completely alone.	Waziva wedwa ngokupheleleyo.
Almost even me.	Phantse nangona mna.
He wanted to get out, away from her.	Wayefuna ukuphuma, kude naye.
Not a letter or anything.	Hayi ileta okanye nantoni na.
Now, and don't.	Ngoku, kwaye musa.
That's what you need to do.	Yiloo nto ekufuneka uyenzile.
You know where you are going.	Uyazi apho uya khona.
Yes it should.	Ewe bekufanele kwenzeke.
I feel bad all the time.	Ndiziva kakubi ngalo lonke ixesha.
Anything can be in it.	Nantoni na inokuba kuyo.
I thought that one day my dad would go too far.	Ndandicinga ukuba ngenye imini utata uya kude kakhulu.
That's it, not more.	Yiyo loo nto, hayi ngakumbi.
I'll do one but I don't know when.	Ndiza kwenza enye kodwa andazi ukuba nini.
I never looked back on that.	Andizange ndijonge emva kuloo nto.
But you are right, obviously.	Kodwa ulungile, ngokucacileyo.
No, not tomorrow.	Hayi, hayi ngomso.
And the man went his way.	Wemka ke umntu lowo.
He is lying in it.	Ulele kuyo.
I want more.	Ndifuna izinto ezininzi.
I didn't see anything else.	Andizange ndibone enye into.
It is not easy to take.	Akukho lula ukuthatha.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
He felt himself.	Waziva ngokwakhe.
I think that's really the case.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto ngokwenene leyo.
He did not want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukwenjenjalo.
And it seemed like the first time.	Kwaye kwakubonakala ngathi kuqala.
Only original music.	Umculo wokuqala kuphela.
When you say.	Xa uthe .
You are only human, after all.	Ungumntu kuphela, emva koko.
It will be all work.	Iza kuba ngumsebenzi wonke.
However, there is already a way to do that.	Nangona kunjalo, sele kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
I always thought everyone knew this.	Bendisoloko ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
They will make a place to live.	Baza kwenza indawo yokuhlala.
I look forward to going.	Ndijonge phambili ukuya.
All day again at home.	Imini yonke kwakhona ekhaya.
He should not have agreed to stay.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba avume ukuhlala.
The gun can not.	Umpu awukwazi.
I could do that now, you know.	Ndingayenza loo nto ngoku, uyazi.
He would be a good man if anything happened.	Uya kuba yindoda elungileyo ukuba kukho nantoni na eyenzekayo.
You bought it in full.	Uthenge ngokupheleleyo.
Because man cannot do it alone.	Kuba umntu akanakuyenza yedwa.
Something has to happen.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenzeke.
A little bit for now.	Kancinci okwangoku.
Then he told another.	Emva koko waxelela omnye.
It is not easy to do.	Akukho lula ukwenza.
He is in the hospital here.	Ulele esibhedlele apha.
It should.	Bekufanele.
Maybe, something else.	Mhlawumbi, enye into.
However, this takes a lot of time.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu.
He left immediately.	Wemka ngoko nangoko.
Not about everything, but certainly about him.	Hayi malunga nayo yonke into, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo ngaye.
He just took a job.	Wathatha nje umsebenzi.
It will take more time.	Kuya kufuna ixesha elingakumbi.
I want to do it all.	Ndifuna ukuyenza yonke.
But it seems to us.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi.
But that would be extremely difficult.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
He would do it again.	Wayeza kuyenza kwakhona.
We know for sure that these.	Siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ezi .
Just help.	Nceda nje.
I hope this is not the case.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku akunjalo.
Maybe he just wanted time, too.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna nje ixesha, naye.
But it seemed that something was happening every day.	Kodwa kwakubonakala ngathi kukho into eyenzekayo yonke imihla.
Later, he said.	Kamva, wathi.
He stayed that way for days.	Wahlala enjalo iintsuku.
Things, not so much.	Izinto, hayi kakhulu.
Flowers, of course.	Iintyatyambo, kunjalo.
We've done it all before !.	Senze konke ngaphambili!.
Well, it didn't.	Kulungile, ayizange.
It has to be good.	Kufuneka kube kuhle.
Human beings .	Abantu .
That's what my man did here.	Wenze njalo umntu wam apha.
That whether, or, whether or not.	Oko nokuba, okanye, nokuba okanye.
But my car.	Kodwa imoto yam.
You know everything about me now.	Uyayazi yonke into ngam ngoku.
I like something unusual.	Ndiyayithanda into engaqhelekanga.
We should have been together.	Bekufanele sibe sobabini kunye.
He walks with it.	Uhamba ngayo.
But this means little.	Kodwa oku kuthetha kancinci.
But he felt better, almost immediately.	Kodwa waziva engcono, phantse ngoko nangoko.
Mary is like that.	UMariya unjalo.
You arrived just in time.	Ufike kwangethuba.
But, of course, nothing.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akukho nto.
Although, last night.	Nangona, phezolo.
He hoped he did.	Wayenethemba lokuba wenze njalo.
The lamp.	Isibane .
I think that is quite clear.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo ngokucacileyo.
I just, really.	Mna nje, ngokwenene.
Again, not a mother at all.	Kwakhona, hayi umama tu.
Really, this seems to be the case.	Ngokwenene, oku kubonakala kunjalo.
I can't say for sure.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
No one really knows how long it will last.	Akukho mntu wakha wazi ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
I know you want to.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyafuna.
You want everything as quickly as possible.	Ufuna yonke into ngokukhawuleza ngokukhawuleza.
However, we know better.	Nangona kunjalo, siyazi ngcono.
Slowly, frequently and how you feel.	Kancinci, rhoqo kwaye uziva njani.
So we need help.	Ngoko sifuna uncedo.
It is best to stay longer.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuhlala ixesha elide.
So often.	Ngoko rhoqo.
He knew what it was.	Wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
He will return when necessary.	Uya kubuya xa kufuneka.
All right, now is the time.	Kulungile, ngoku lixesha.
That's it, he thought.	Yile nto, wacinga.
There is music.	Kukho umculo.
I couldn't think of that now.	Andikwazanga ukucinga ngaloo nto ngoku.
And then, finally, he spoke.	Kwaye ke, ekugqibeleni, wathetha.
We will have lunch immediately.	Siza kutya isidlo sasemini ngoko nangoko.
But nothing more happened.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke ngakumbi.
I wanted to do something to help.	Ndandifuna ukwenza into ukunceda.
And go one more time.	Kwaye uhambe ngexesha elinye ngakumbi.
I'm so scared, if you want to know the truth.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu, ukuba ufuna ukwazi inyaniso.
Not this time though.	Hayi ngeli xesha kodwa.
That seems like a long time.	Oko kubonakala ngathi lixesha elide.
I asked for some.	Ndacela ezinye.
What happens in prison stays in prison.	Into eyenzekayo entolongweni uhlala entolongweni.
Maybe we'll go this week.	Mhlawumbi siza kuhamba kule veki.
Your mother, to another.	Umama wakho, komnye.
And all is nothing.	Kwaye konke akukho nto.
I love it up there, too.	Ndiyayithanda apho phezulu, nam.
I certainly learned a lot.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifunde okuninzi.
He said he fully understood.	Wathi waqonda ngokupheleleyo.
No, no, no question.	Hayi, hayi, akukho mbuzo.
It's too long.	Lixesha elide kakhulu.
I need to look further.	Kufuneka ndijonge ngakumbi.
Only that way.	Ngaloo ndlela kuphela.
Not just a picture, everything.	Hayi nje umfanekiso, yonke into.
It would take a lot of our mind.	Bekuya kuthatha ingqondo yethu eninzi.
It could be anyone here.	Inokuba nabani na apha.
Then he ran out of the room.	Emva koko wabaleka waphuma egumbini.
He too wanted to know.	Naye wayefuna ukwazi.
And that he will be back soon.	Kwaye ukuba uya kubuya kungekudala.
He is sure of it.	Uqinisekile ngayo.
I didn't know he could do that.	Ndandingazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
Well, we'll see about that.	Kulungile, siza kubona ngaloo nto.
You better look at that first.	Kungcono ujonge oko kuqala.
Something urgent needs to be done.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe ngokukhawuleza.
Of course you need to know what this is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka uyazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
He just wants me to talk.	Ufuna nje ukuba ndithethe.
He doesn't like my thing.	Akayithandi into yam.
What you want it to be.	Oko ufuna ukuba.
Not his phone.	Hayi ifowuni yakhe.
You have to do it regularly.	Kufuneka uyenze rhoqo.
There is something strange about him.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga ngaye.
Not life.	Hayi ubomi.
I do not know anyone.	Andazi nabani.
I also knew nothing about all of this.	Nam ndandingazi nto ngayo yonke le nto.
He apologized and said no.	Wacela uxolo wathi hayi.
At first, he did not think so much of himself.	Ekuqaleni, wayengacingi kangako ngaye.
There is no one else.	Akakho omnye umntu.
Indeed, we know that it is.	Ngokwenene, siyazi ukuba kunjalo.
Well, not at this time.	Ewe, hayi ngeli xesha.
If it could be that easy.	Ukuba inokuba lula ngolo hlobo.
And yes that is true.	Kwaye ewe yinyani leyo.
I can complete three weeks.	Ndiyakwazi ukugqiba iiveki ezintathu.
That will come in time.	Oko kuya kufika ngexesha.
Everyone needs an answer, all the time.	Wonke umntu ufuna impendulo, ngalo lonke ixesha.
I can't !.	Andikwazi!.
Now everyone loves it.	Ngoku wonke umntu uyayithanda.
If you don't want to be yourself.	Ukuba awufuni ukuba nguwe.
My voice to it.	Ilizwi lam kuyo.
You seem to have a problem.	Ubonakala unengxaki.
It's too much.	Kuba kakhulu.
No, please not that! 	Akunjalo, nceda hayi loo nto!
It takes almost no time.	Kuthatha phantse akukho xesha.
At that moment, something very unusual happened.	Kanye ngelo xesha, kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
Probably no one will do that.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu uya kukwenza oko.
And they will know.	Kwaye baya kukwazi.
Maybe one day you'll need help.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini uya kufuna uncedo.
I mean, it's not.	Ndiya kuthetha, akunjalo.
I thought about everything else.	Ndacinga ngayo yonke enye into.
Nice house.	Indlu entle.
Sure, he is busy.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uxakekile.
I didn't, you know.	Andizange, uyazi.
And you know very, very well.	Kwaye uyazi kakhulu kakhulu.
Again, there is no success here.	Kwakhona, akukho kuphumelela apha.
That's why you work there.	Yiyo loo nto usebenza apho.
I did not help.	Khange ndincede.
Certainly nothing happened.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto yenzekileyo.
He did not go well.	Akazange ahambe kakuhle.
You know better than I do.	Uyazi ngcono kunam.
Our question is how this happened.	Umbuzo wethu kukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
You have to do a lot of work.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi kakhulu.
Tell me where it is going.	Ndixelele apho iya khona.
I can't have it, yet.	Andikwazi ukuba nayo, okwangoku.
It might be right for you.	Inokuba ilungile kuwe.
He goes all the way.	Uhamba yonke indlela.
He thinks of himself alone.	Ucinga ngaye yedwa.
It should be very easy for you.	Kufuneka kube lula kakhulu kuwe.
Or maybe not at all.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela.
And he didn't go after that, he ran away.	Kwaye akazange ahambe emva koko, wabaleka.
What the doctor has to do.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile ugqirha.
Book, book, book.	Incwadi, incwadi, incwadi.
Yes, he would like that.	Ewe, angathanda oko.
There is a car in the back.	Kukho imoto phaya emva.
You know why you are here.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
Despite this.	Nangona oku.
He did this time and time again.	Uyenzile lento ixesha nexesha kwakhona.
It's all right .	Yonke ilungile .
It seemed everywhere and nowhere.	Kwakubonakala kukho yonke indawo kwaye akukho ndawo.
I just wanted something to happen.	Ndandifuna nje into eyenzekayo.
Moreover, there is another way.	Ngaphezu koko, kukho enye indlela.
That is one job.	Ngumsebenzi omnye lowo.
Well, though, if you want to give it a try.	Kulungile, nangona kunjalo, ukuba ufuna ukuzama.
It's just hard to say.	Kunzima nje ukuthetha.
He too died.	Naye wafa.
It's not fun here.	Akukho mnandi apha.
I want to make more space.	Ndifuna ukwenza indawo eninzi.
That way you have time.	Ngaloo ndlela unexesha.
I thought you liked it.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayithanda.
It's just me.	Ndim nje mna.
He died instantly.	Wafa ngoko nangoko.
Something is happening there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
You are as good as you told me.	Ulungile njengoko undixelele njalo.
He didn't, of course.	Akazange, kunjalo.
I could not win today.	Andikwazanga ukuphumelela namhlanje.
Well, no one but me.	Ewe, akukho mntu ngaphandle kwam.
I don't want to talk about him anymore.	Andifuni kuphinda ndithethe ngaye.
It's hard to sit in front of him.	Kunzima ukuhlala phambi kwakhe.
There is definitely something wrong here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho into engalunganga apha.
Now is a good time.	Ngoku lixesha elihle.
I thought you never knew you would really do it.	Bendicinga ukuba ubungazi ukuba uya kuyenza ngokwenene.
And marriage.	Kwaye umtshato.
There is only so much space there.	Kukho indawo eninzi kuphela apho.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu leyo.
But it will be difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima.
However, there is another problem.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho enye ingxaki.
He certainly will not go anywhere now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akasayi kuya ndawo ngoku.
For it is a thing.	Ngokuba yinto.
Soon he will sit down.	Kungekudala uza kuhlala phantsi.
You do not have to wait long.	Akufanele ulinde ixesha elide.
I have no time, though.	Andinaxesha, nangona kunjalo.
I went ahead.	Ndaya phambili.
It will also be very nice outside.	Kwakhona kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu ngaphandle.
I learned all about you.	Ndifunde konke ngawe.
I know everything you want to say.	Ndiyayazi yonke into ofuna ukuyithetha.
Too long, really.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, ngokwenene.
We want that to happen.	Sifuna ukuba kwenzeke oko.
You know that this is possible.	Uyazi ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
That should be maybe.	Oko kufuneka kube mhlawumbi.
But that happened later.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kamva.
You have to do that.	Kufuneka wenze loo nto.
Yes, trying to do that.	Ewe, ukuzama ukwenza njalo.
Let me just do it.	Mandiyenze nje.
I don't know why there.	Andazi ukuba kutheni na apho.
My job is here.	Umsebenzi wam ulapha.
I thought about everything.	Ndiye ndacinga ngayo yonke into.
A nice little car.	Imoto encinci entle.
Well, it never happened.	Kulungile, akuzange kwenzeke.
So, if it happens, it happens.	Ngoko, ukuba kwenzeka, kwenzeka.
Another time, maybe.	Elinye ixesha, mhlawumbi.
I think so, and I hope so.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo, kwaye ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo.
That's what you think.	Yiloo nto ucinga ngayo.
I speak at home.	Ndithetha ekhaya.
It would be painful for me.	Bekuya kuba buhlungu kum.
You know the problem here.	Uyayazi ingxaki apha.
You have to come to him.	Kufuneka uze kuye.
Almost everything.	Phantse yonke into.
I'm talking about power.	Ndithetha ngamandla.
The call, then.	Umnxeba, ngoko.
And then nothing at all.	Kwaye ke akukho nto konke konke.
That's the only thing outside.	Yiloo nto kuphela ngaphandle.
Not you or others or other things.	Hayi wena okanye abanye okanye ezinye izinto.
You have done a great job.	Wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
Yes, that is exactly what happened.	Ewe, oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
After you buy something else.	Emva kokuba uthenge enye into.
I'm happy this week.	Ndiyavuya kule veki.
He is here again.	Ulapha kwakhona.
Probably not that way.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngolo hlobo.
I wanted him to say something, whatever.	Bendifuna athethe into, nantoni na.
There is something wrong with it.	Kukho into embi ngayo.
Always new.	Ngalo lonke ixesha entsha.
But if you did.	Kodwa ukuba uyenzile.
Then he would see that something was clearly wrong.	Emva koko wayeza kubona ukuba kukho into eyenzekileyo ngokucacileyo.
Then to him.	Emva koko kuye.
They all say no.	Bonke bathi hayi.
It will happen or not.	Iya kwenzeka okanye hayi.
My dad is smarter than you think.	Utata wam ukrelekrele kunokuba ucinga.
He did not want to talk to her about anything.	Akazange afune ukuba athethe naye ngayo nantoni na.
I don't think he will ever do that.	Andiqondi ukuba uya kuze enze njalo.
This work makes it so much fun.	Lo msebenzi wenza kube mnandi kakhulu.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo kwaphela.
Why are you here.	Kutheni ulapha.
Anything to help.	Nantoni na ukunceda.
I don't believe in that.	Andikholelwa kuloo nto.
As he knew it would be.	Njengoko wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
And wait longer.	Kwaye ulinde ngakumbi.
But the fact is, he did not want her to do that.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba, wayengafuni ukuba enjenjalo.
He never told me how he knew.	Zange andixelele ukuba wazi njani.
He is here to help.	Ulapha ukunceda.
I did one very thing.	Ndenza into enye kakhulu.
And he did not speak.	Kwaye akazange athethe.
And we have to have that.	Kwaye kufuneka sibe nayo loo nto.
Finding a large place was not easy.	Ukufumana indawo enkulu kwakungekho lula.
I think we should go our own way.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka sihambe ngendlela yethu.
Very, very good work.	Kakhulu, umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
Maybe something like this now.	Mhlawumbi kukho into enje ngoku.
No problem there for me.	Akukho ngxaki apho kum.
I had to think it through.	Kwafuneka ndicinge kakuhle.
No problem, for now.	Akukho ngxaki, okwangoku.
Eating slowly.	Ukutya kancinci kancinci.
I should be too.	Ndifanele ukuba nam.
I really want to do a lot of things.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
And that's all for now.	Kwaye oko konke okwangoku.
He did not appear.	Zange abonakale.
I made mistakes, too.	Ndenza iimpazamo, nam.
And dinner.	Kwaye isidlo sangokuhlwa.
She is very smart, very beautiful.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu, mhle kakhulu.
And so he goes over you.	Kwaye ngoko uhamba ngaphezu kwakho.
Not everyone, but it will make you think.	Ayinguye wonke umntu, kodwa iya kukwenza ucinge.
This is a strange fact.	Le yinyani engaqhelekanga.
But it is not that simple.	Kodwa akukho lula kangako.
Look inside you.	Jonga ngaphakathi kuwe.
We do not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba siyenze indawo yethu le.
A few things.	Izinto ezimbalwa.
She did not know where her son had gone.	Wayengazi ukuba unyana wakhe uye phi.
Some very, some a little.	Abanye kakhulu, abanye kancinci.
Being far away will really be far away.	Ukuba kude phaya ngenene kuya kuba kude.
I'll see what happens now.	Ndiza kubona ngoku ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And there is not much money.	Kwaye akukho mali eninzi.
Sleep story.	Ibali lokulala.
But he did not speak, or he could not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe, okanye akakwazi ukuthetha.
I never went with it.	Andizange ndihambe ngayo.
They will live in it.	Baya kuhlala kuyo.
I did not want to talk to her at all.	Bendingafuni tu ukuba athethe naye.
He never knew it was time.	Wayengazi kwaphela ukuba lixesha.
I have to tell you about it.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ngayo.
But they will come back tomorrow.	Kodwa baya kubuya ngomso.
And one is wrong.	Kwaye enye engalunganga.
You have to do your job.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi wakho.
But not this morning.	Kodwa hayi ngale ntsasa.
You will try anything.	Uya kuzama nantoni na.
This should not be just a joke.	Oku akufuneki kube yinto nje yokudlala.
He should have stopped there.	Bekufanele ayeke apho.
That means more than you know.	Oko kuthetha ngaphezu kokuba uyazi.
But that seems like a small thing in that.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi yinto encinci kuloo nto.
I think that happened to me last night.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kwenzeka kum phezolo.
It never happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke.
He opened the window and came to bed.	Wavula ifestile weza ebhedini.
You think it will be easy, but it is not.	Ucinga ukuba kuya kuba lula, kodwa akunjalo.
Seeing something else.	Ukubona enye into.
I wanted nothing from him.	Ndandingafuni nto kuye.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akufuneki.
That's my place, by the way.	Nantso indawo yam, ngendlela.
But if you think so, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba ucinga njalo, kulungile.
I had to think about that.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
Not until you tell me.	Hayi de undixelele.
Yes, work is a good thing.	Ewe, umsebenzi yinto entle.
Sorry .	Uxolo .
However, this is not really necessary.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akufuneki ngokwenene.
I have read many books.	Ndifunde iincwadi ezininzi.
I don't really like that.	Andiyithandi kakhulu loo nto.
He will be with us soon.	Uza kuba nathi kungekudala.
First comes thinking.	Kuqala kufika ukucinga.
There was no place to stay.	Kwakungekho ndawo yokuhlala.
There is nothing in that case.	Akukho nto kuloo meko.
I could not wait to get home.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuba ndifike ekhaya.
We almost know.	Phantse siyazi.
And everyone loves a cat.	Kwaye wonke umntu uthanda ikati.
I forgot before.	Ndilibele ngaphambili.
And everyone in it.	Kwaye wonke umntu kuyo.
He hopes we will succeed.	Unethemba lokuba siya kuphumelela.
He slept with others, too.	Walala abanye, naye.
Therefore, no one is like that.	Ngoko ke, akukho mntu unjalo.
You don't have to talk like that.	Akufunekanga uthethe ngolo hlobo.
Certainly not possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
I never thought about all that.	Khange ndicinge ngayo yonke loo nto.
He knew, he thought.	Wayesazi, wacinga.
I really enjoy my work.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ngumsebenzi wam.
I think it could be better that way.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokuba ngcono ngolo hlobo.
My father tried to make it easier for me.	Utata wazama ukuyenza lula yonke loo nto.
He stayed up all night.	Wayehlala ubusuku bonke.
Sure, that's fine.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ilungile.
He was visible.	Wayebonakala .
He decided to go home early.	Wagqiba ekubeni agoduke kwangethuba.
You are tired all the way.	Udiniwe yonke indlela.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akayazi ukuba yintoni na.
He looked at the house.	Wajonga indlu.
Before you know it.	Ngaphambi kokuba uyazi.
I'll talk to you soon.	Ndiza kuthetha kungekudala.
I don't remember why, exactly.	Andikhumbuli ukuba kutheni, kanye.
All would be well.	Konke kunokuba kulungile.
She can speak as much as she would like.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha kangangoko angathanda.
Now he did not.	Ngoku akazange.
I have never seen anyone.	Andizange ndimbone nabani na.
He wanted to quit.	Wayefuna ukuyeka.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngaloo nto.
You know what’s unusual, though.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni engaqhelekanga, nangona kunjalo.
And look inside us.	Kwaye jonga ngaphakathi kuthi.
Something happened to me.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
He said it was okay with him.	Wathi kulungile naye.
He went in there just doing his job.	Wangena apho wenza nje umsebenzi wakhe.
He just told me that.	Undixelele nje ukuba.
I never said such a thing to him.	Zange ndithethe into enje kuye.
Good again.	Kuhle kwakhona.
And that's exactly what it is.	Kwaye yiloo nto ngokwenene.
This problem could have happened.	Kunokuba kwenzeke le ngxaki.
You can do that, too.	Ungayenza loo nto, nawe.
I don't know, but you probably know.	Andazi, kodwa mhlawumbi uyazi.
Or two, if possible.	Okanye ezimbini, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Eating alone tonight.	Ukutya yedwa ngokuhlwanje.
Or anything similar.	Okanye nantoni na efanayo.
My work makes it so.	Umsebenzi wam wenza ukuba kube njalo.
But this is good for me.	Kodwa oku kulungile kum.
Well, there is something wrong with this.	Kulungile, kukho into engalunganga ngale nto.
We are going to the hospital.	Siya esibhedlele.
I couldn't take much.	Andikwazanga ukuthatha okuninzi.
Now, maybe that's a good thing.	Ngoku, mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
Nobody knows anything about it.	Akukho mntu wazi nto ngayo.
But he also felt it.	Kodwa naye waziva.
In the end she is scared.	Ekugqibeleni uyoyika.
Or so he thought at first.	Okanye ngoko wayecinga ekuqaleni.
This is possible, but not easy to do.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa akukho lula ukwenza.
And if you are very lucky.	Kwaye ukuba unethamsanqa kakhulu.
I'm sure and for now.	Ndiqinisekile kwaye okwangoku.
We'll see where it goes.	Siza kubona apho iya khona.
I doubt you.	Ndiyathandabuza ngawe.
But he did a great job.	Kodwa wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
It will only last a few years.	Kuya kuhlala kuphela iminyaka embalwa.
I think this can be fun.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kunokuba mnandi.
For all of us, you are right.	Kuthi sonke, ulungile.
It's your person.	Ngumntu wakho.
Because next to me.	Kuba ecaleni kwam.
Something big is happening.	Kukho into enkulu eyenzekayo.
It was not necessary, of course.	Kwakungeyomfuneko, kunjalo.
My father will do a great job.	Utata uza kwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
He did not speak to her.	Akazange athethe naye.
You got it .	Unayo .
As we will do so.	Njengoko siza kwenza njalo.
So all is well.	Ngoko konke kulungile.
He too was doing well.	Naye wayenza kakuhle.
But there is peace now.	Kodwa kukho uxolo ngoku.
I think it will be fun.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba mnandi.
If so, tell your friends.	Ukuba kunjalo, xelela abahlobo bakho.
You will finally.	Uya kuthi ekugqibeleni.
However, it takes a lot of time and effort.	Nangona kunjalo, kuthatha ixesha elininzi kwaye kunzima.
No, not you.	Hayi, hayi nawe.
Everything you do on time.	Yonke into uyenza ngexesha.
He said he did not know why.	Uye wathi akazi ukuba kutheni.
So not so much.	Ngoko hayi kakhulu.
He slept on my bed all night.	Walala ebhedini yam ubusuku bonke.
Maybe not so much though.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu kodwa.
He saw something in me.	Wabona into kum.
And that seems to be the case now.	Kwaye kubonakala kunjalo ngoku.
I know you want to help.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyafuna ukunceda.
Well, how do you think.	Ewe, wenza njani ukucinga.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
I wanted to know everything about it.	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into ngayo.
He was not one of us.	Yayingenguye wethu.
He was not present at that time.	Wayengekho ngelo xesha.
And she looks good.	Kwaye ukhangeleka kakuhle.
I'm not going anywhere with him.	Andiyi ndawo naye.
He went to his house.	Waya endlini yakhe.
When he speaks.	Xa ethetha.
He wanted to get out of it, everything.	Wayefuna ukuphuma kuyo, yonke into.
Thank you and goodbye.	Enkosi kwaye uhambe kakuhle.
I saw something.	Ndabona into.
Let him do it to me.	Makayenze kum.
But they will try.	Kodwa baza kuzama.
I wanted to be better than you.	Bendifuna ukuba ngcono kunawe.
I would like an answer.	Ndingathanda impendulo.
I know what needs to be done.	Ndiyayazi into ekufuneka yenziwe.
I wonder who that is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani lowo.
Just a story.	Ibali nje.
Look at other people.	Ujonge abanye abantu.
All day long, nothing happened.	Imini yonke, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
It is very difficult to make a call.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza umnxeba.
All is well !.	Konke kuhle!.
He saw something else.	Wabona enye into.
Anyone I ask for help.	Nabani na ndicela uncedo.
All this he was able to think of after a while.	Konke oku wakwazi ukucinga emva kwexesha.
Other than that, it is much better this way.	Ngaphandle koko, kungcono kakhulu ngale ndlela.
That is her child.	Ngumntwana wakhe lowo.
Not that he was scared.	Hayi ukuba wayesoyika.
Your mother is here, too.	Umama wakho ulapha, naye.
But it is clear.	Kodwa kucacile.
I can't wait to meet you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukudibana nawe.
Something else happened to him.	Kwenzeka enye into kuye.
Same place.	Indawo efanayo.
Maybe not tonight, but finally.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngokuhlwanje, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
Maybe soon for me.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kum.
He wanted to stay longer.	Wayefuna ukuhlala ixesha elide.
He has checked on the police.	Uye wajonga amapolisa.
But he did not succeed, after that.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele, emva koko.
I will always tell the truth.	Ndiya kuhlala ndithetha inyaniso.
You seem to have succeeded.	Kubonakala ngathi uphumelele.
Everything will come on time.	Yonke into iza kufika ngexesha.
She is happy about it.	Uyavuya ngayo.
Not unless you wish.	Hayi ngaphandle kokuba unqwenela.
But you'd better come sooner.	Kodwa kungcono uze ngokukhawuleza.
You may be.	Usenokuba .
Just saying bad things.	Ukuthetha nje kakubi.
She did not know how she felt now.	Wayengazi ukuba uziva njani ngoku.
Maybe some things.	Mhlawumbi ezinye izinto.
My little thing? 	Into yam encinci?
It's hard to find such a thing.	Kunzima ukufumana into enjalo.
I tried to get help.	Ndazama ukufumana uncedo.
You do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko nayo.
It's just this.	Yinto nje le.
We will only stay a week here.	Siza kuhlala iveki kuphela apha.
However, before you do that, consider two things.	Nangona kunjalo, ngaphambi kokuba wenze njalo, jonga izinto ezimbini.
And then he went to college.	Kwaye emva koko waya ekholejini.
Therefore, he must have been much more.	Ngoko ke, umele ukuba wayesele ngakumbi.
A long time there.	Ithuba elide apho.
You already have a problem.	Sele unengxaki.
It would be a good job, he thought.	Wayeza kuba ngumsebenzi olungileyo, wacinga njalo.
He went in, did something about it.	Wangena, wenza into ngaloo nto.
I'm glad you were able to come.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi ukuza.
Look at you.	Ujonge wena.
If you are interested, we will start with it.	Ukuba unomdla, siza kuqala ngayo.
Work, house, marriage.	Umsebenzi, indlu, umtshato.
And do this quickly.	Kwaye wenze oku ngokukhawuleza.
However, there are flaws in it.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho iimpazamo kuyo.
Then something terrible happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka into embi.
So you better go with him.	Ngoko kungcono uhambe nawe.
If you are human.	Ukuba ungumntu.
Driving requires all your attention, all the time.	Ukuqhuba kufuna yonke ingqalelo yakho, lonke ixesha.
He lay down on the bed.	Walala ebhedini.
Monkey and you.	Nyani nawe.
Her parents are coming.	Baza kuza abazali bakhe.
No, no, no and no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi kwaye hayi.
I feel exactly the same.	Ndiziva kanye kanye.
Clearly, really.	Ngokucacileyo, ngokwenene.
I think the music is good.	Ndicinga ukuba umculo ulungile.
Or, just look a little bit.	Okanye, jonga nje kancinci.
And stay up all night.	Kwaye uhlale ubusuku bonke.
No, you did well.	Hayi, wenze kakuhle.
He is not our person.	Akangomntu wethu.
But you will get something.	Kodwa uya kufumana into.
I can't sing, either.	Andikwazi ukucula, nam.
My father was not like that.	Utata wayengekho into enje.
You should not do that at all.	Akufanele ukuba uyayenza loo nto kwaphela.
He doesn't have to have it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba abe nayo.
He looked at the bed.	Wajonga ebhedini.
But you can't have everything.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuba nayo yonke into.
There is no tomorrow.	Akukho sakusasa namhlanje.
I go to my room.	Ndiya egumbini lam.
I really got home.	Ndifike ekhaya nyani.
This is how you come.	Ngale ndlela uza ngayo.
And the man died.	Kwaye umntu wafa.
If you wish.	Xa unqwenela.
And so he went down further.	Kwaye ngoko wehla ngakumbi.
Too little finishing.	Ukugqiba kancinci kakhulu.
It would be great.	Bekuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
No one has ever done such a thing.	Akukho mntu wenze into enje.
I'm glad he is.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguye.
But we all know how it goes.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuba kuhamba njani.
I should have done that a long time ago.	Bekufanele ukuba kudala ndenze njalo.
Not before.	Akunjalo ngaphambili.
Your dad says your mom wants to meet him.	Utata wakho uthi umama wakho ufuna ukudibana naye.
He wasn't very good at it, though.	Wayengekho kakuhle kakhulu kuyo, nangona kunjalo.
To tell the truth.	Ukuthetha inyani.
Otherwise it would have been fine.	Ngaphandle koko kube kuhle.
And there's no reason you can't.	Kwaye akukho sizathu sokuba awukwazi.
He likes to do outside.	Uthanda ukwenza ngaphandle.
There it is now.	Kukho ke ngoku.
But one thing out there.	Kodwa enye into ngaphandle.
You might be right about all of that.	Usenokuba ulungile ngayo yonke loo nto.
I can speak clearly.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha ngokucacileyo.
He doesn't think he did something out of the ordinary.	Akacingi ukuba wenze into engaqhelekanga.
And this time.	Kwaye ngeli xesha.
He just stays in the day.	Uhlala nje imini.
You will say nothing to him.	Akuyi kuthetha nto kuye.
Now then.	Ngoku ke .
Or, something like that.	Okanye, into enjalo.
Everyone looked back at it.	Wonke umntu wajonga emva kuyo.
He did everything quickly.	Wenza yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
But maybe there.	Kodwa mhlawumbi phaya.
We will do two things.	Siza kwenza izinto ezimbini.
Yeah, that's why you're here.	Ewe, yiyo loo nto ulapha.
We will not do it.	Asiyi kuyenza.
Just taking everything.	Ukuthatha nje yonke into.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo leyo.
Yes, we have to act fast.	Ewe, kufuneka senze ngokukhawuleza.
But clearly you are.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo nawe unjalo.
But he also did not speak.	Kodwa naye akazange athethe.
I hope you live here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhlala apha.
I can play with it.	Ndiyakwazi ukudlala ngayo.
He said that sooner or later he knew that this would happen.	Wathi kungekudala okanye kamva wayesazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
At home, he finished.	Ekhaya, wagqiba.
But then nothing.	Kodwa ke akukho nto.
I would love to meet him, though.	Ndingathanda ukudibana naye, nangona kunjalo.
I can't eat much right now.	Andikwazi kutya kakhulu ngoku.
It could be this week.	Inokuba kule veki.
This time, soon.	Ngeli xesha, kungekudala.
This is probably a good thing.	Oku mhlawumbi yinto elungileyo.
Of course it is.	Ewe kunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
I never really did.	Andizange ndiyenze ngokwenene.
Sorry, but you better think again.	Uxolo, kodwa kungcono ucinge kwakhona.
He also did not want to know.	Naye wayengafuni ukwazi.
Okay there.	Kulungile apho.
Maybe you go to work.	Mhlawumbi uya emsebenzini.
He looked at the woman.	Wajonga umfazi.
I want to leave right away.	Ndifuna ukuhamba ngoko nangoko.
I wanted to stay with you too.	Nam bendifuna ukuhlala nawe.
People say yes.	Abantu bathi ewe kakhulu.
If you don't want this, fine.	Ukuba awufuni oku, kulungile.
But you do not have to take the test.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze uvavanyo.
That is good for us.	Ilungile loo nto kuthi.
You will need to consider doing this.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngokwenza oku.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ukwenza njani oku.
He went, he came.	Wahamba, wafika.
I do not know why and why not.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kwaye kutheni.
He will not be able to work for many days.	Akayi kukwazi ukusebenza iintsuku ezininzi.
I can't tell you more than that right now.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ngaphezu koko ngoku.
He meant this.	Wayethetha oku.
Of course, you can't.	Kunjalo, awukwazi.
But of course.	Kodwa ke kunjalo.
Just look at the word.	Jonga nje igama.
Not at the same time.	Hayi ngexesha elinye.
Everyone thought so, except me.	Wonke umntu wayecinga njalo, ngaphandle kwam.
And to talk about it.	Kwaye ukuthetha ngayo.
But no one wants to talk about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngale nto.
Let's get together.	Makhe kunye.
I thought long and hard for three days.	Ndacinga ixesha elide kwaye kunzima iintsuku ezintathu.
And it would be wrong to get it completely.	Kwaye kunokuba yinto engalunganga ukufumana ngokupheleleyo.
I'm talking about money.	Ndithetha ngemali.
No, probably.	Akunjalo, mhlawumbi.
Something very bad happened here.	Kukho into embi kakhulu eyenzekileyo apha.
I need your help.	Ndicela uncedo kuwe.
There comes a time when enough is enough.	Kufika ixesha apho ngokwaneleyo ngokwaneleyo.
Thank you for your time!.	Enkosi ngexesha lakho!.
He left immediately.	Uye wemka kwangoko.
Girl, too.	Intombi, nayo.
He wanted her to go too.	Wayefuna ukuba naye ahambe.
Well, good job on this.	Ewe, umsebenzi omhle kule nto.
He wanted his life back.	Wayefuna ubomi bakhe kwakhona.
We will be the one.	Siza kuba nguye.
You know where.	Uyazi apho.
Nobody looks good.	Akukho mntu ukhangeleka kakuhle.
Maybe he knew everything.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi yonke into.
I have never had this problem before.	Andizange ndibe nayo le ngxaki ngaphambili.
But that's why you're here.	Kodwa yiyo loo nto ulapha.
Why did it happen.	Kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke.
My wife does not want to do anything.	Umfazi wam akafuni kwenza nto.
You have to get dressed.	Kufuneka unxibe.
Everyone ran to see it.	Wonke umntu wabaleka ukuya kubona.
And he didn't want to.	Kwaye wayengafuni.
So that will take time.	Ngoko oko kuya kuthatha ixesha.
No, please.	Hayi, nceda.
He has spoken.	Uye wathetha.
He tried everything.	Wazama yonke into.
That would be the first one.	Oko kunokuba ngowokuqala.
However, this is certainly difficult for me.	Nangona kunjalo, oku ngokuqinisekileyo kunzima kum.
You can be very good.	Unokuba kakuhle kakhulu.
Being too fast.	Ukuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He did it, he could.	Uyenzile, wakwazi.
I read well.	Ndifunde kakuhle.
Before anything happens.	Ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke nantoni na.
I don't want to meet him.	Andifuni ukudibana naye.
Two days now.	Iintsuku ezimbini ngoku.
Long name.	Igama elide.
This is a good job.	Ngumsebenzi omhle lo.
There was not much to see.	Kwakungekho nto ingako ukubona.
Everything is well done.	Yonke into yenziwe kakuhle.
This seems to be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi yiyo le.
Maybe one day you will have children.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini uya kuba nabantwana.
Yes, that's perfectly fine.	Ewe oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo ke.
I looked at him.	Ndijonge kuye.
That's exactly what this book is about.	Kunjalo kanye ngale ncwadi.
I think you already know that.	Ndicinga ukuba sele uyayazi loo nto.
He did not go with her.	Akazange naye.
But this should not be too far away.	Kodwa oku akufuneki kube kude.
He looked at the ball.	Wajonga ibhola.
Now, not another name.	Ngoku, hayi elinye igama.
Taking his car.	Ukuthatha imoto yakhe.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wavuma.
You probably know better.	Mhlawumbi wazi kakuhle.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
He knew a little bit.	Wayesazi kancinci.
Do you like?.	Ingaba uyayithanda?.
It’s hard to walk and it’s hard to stay away.	Kunzima ukuhamba kwaye kunzima ukuhlala kude.
He was not alone, of course.	Wayengekho yedwa, kunjalo.
How to live alone.	Indlela yokuhlala wedwa.
Maybe that's me.	Mhlawumbi ndim lowo.
I wanted to come home.	Ndandifuna ukuza ekhaya.
So, we did just that.	Ngoko, senze kanye loo nto.
He ate and finished.	Watya wagqiba.
It is very difficult, very demanding.	Kunzima kakhulu, kufuna kakhulu.
They live in a very small area.	Bahlala kwindawo encinci kakhulu.
Taking a little for him.	Ukuthatha kancinci kuye.
He almost died today.	Uphantse wafa namhlanje.
Is it true.	Ngaba yinyani.
Really good job.	Umsebenzi omhle ngokwenene.
However, he does not want to.	Nangona kunjalo, akafuni.
There is a new message.	Kukho umyalezo omtsha.
But to me, not to you.	Kodwa kum, hayi kuwe.
You know, though.	Uyazi, nangona kunjalo.
Finding life together.	Ukufumana ubomi kunye.
Do not speak ill of yourself.	Musa ukuthetha kakubi ngawe.
I told her it would be fun.	Ndamxelela ukuba kuya kuba mnandi.
He would proceed fast enough.	Wayeza kuqhubeka ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
I know it's you.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguwe.
Go, if you want.	Ukuhamba, ukuba uyafuna.
He is more afraid of you than you are.	Woyika wena ngaphezu kwakho.
But you must succeed.	Kodwa kufuneka uphumelele.
Now we will have it.	Ngoku siza kuba nayo.
I just don’t know how you got there.	Andazi nje ukuba ufike njani apho.
I did not hear anyone.	Andizange ndive mntu.
With everything, really.	Ngayo yonke into, ngokwenene.
Talking about one thing.	Ukuthetha ngento enye.
Anything else and you waste time.	Nantoni na enye kwaye uchitha ixesha.
Now obviously.	Ngoku ngokucacileyo .
I never knew there was anything wrong with it.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngayo.
You will win or you will win.	Uya kuphumelela okanye uya kuphumelela.
No, really, he does.	Hayi, ngokwenene, uyayenza.
It will be easy to find.	Kuya kuba lula ukufumana.
And he will not make it easy for you.	Kwaye akayi kwenza kube lula kuwe.
In a way, it is.	Ngendlela ethile, kunjalo.
He was able to do it all by himself.	Wakwazi ukwenza yonke loo nto eyedwa.
His flesh.	Inyama yakhe .
Thank you, thank you, you definitely do.	Enkosi, enkosi, ngokuqinisekileyo uyayenza.

He wanted dinner.	Wayefuna isidlo sangokuhlwa.
He will not be with you.	Akayi kuba nawe.

Nobody wanted to die.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukufa.
Why thank you.	Kutheni enkosi.
Then finish.	Emva koko ukugqiba.
And many other people.	Kwaye abanye abantu abaninzi.

Or not at all.	Okanye akunjalo kwaphela.
A few questions for you.	Imibuzo embalwa kuwe.
His daughter will probably come with him.	Intombi yakhe mhlawumbi iza kuza naye.
But the truth is, no one really knows.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba, akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
But maybe he did something else.	Kodwa mhlawumbi wenza enye into.
We both know he can do it anytime.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba angayenza loo nto nanini na.
I will be there for you, for you.	Ndiya kuba lapho ngenxa yakho, ngenxa yakho.
One is no play.	Enye akukho ukudlala.
I wanted to tell you before I left.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela phambi kokuba ndihambe.

How do you know many.	Wazi njani ukuba abaninzi .
I don't have to stay here.	Akufuneki ndihlale apha.
Tell the woman.	Xelela umfazi.
Thank you for doing this.	Enkosi ngokwenza oku.
I live alone, most of the time.	Ndihlala ndedwa, ixesha elininzi.

He should not have done this.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ayenze le nto.
It didn't hurt much.	Akuzange kube buhlungu kakhulu.
He'll just talk.	Uza kuthetha nje.
Something very wrong might have happened.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
He went back to school.	Wabuyela esikolweni.

But he clearly did.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo wakwenza oko.
You said we would talk about it.	Ubuthe siza kuthetha ngayo.

Unless he rarely makes mistakes.	Ngaphandle kokuba akafane enze iimpazamo.
Is.	Ngaba .
But not something else.	Kodwa hayi enye into.
Far away.	Kude kude.
He must come to us.	Kufuneka eze kuthi.
The doctor came.	Wafika ugqirha.

It's bedtime now.	Lixesha lokulala ngoku.

Most days he stays by my side.	Iintsuku ezininzi uhlala ecaleni kwam.
We will repeat that.	Siza kuphinda loo nto.
I have no answer.	Andinayo impendulo.
She is looking away.	Ujonge ecaleni.
He could not speak a word.	Akazange akwazi ukuthetha ilizwi.
I just think of everything.	Ndicinga nje ngayo yonke into.
All, alone.	Konke, yedwa.
I hope everyone will be like that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu uya kuba njalo.
He has always felt this way.	Kudala waziva ngolu hlobo.
You should have left long ago.	Bekufanele wemka kudala.
Now it was clear.	Ngoku kwakucacile.
That will be all for now.	Oko kuya kuba konke okwangoku.
Please do this.	Nceda wenze oku.
I did not help here.	Khange ndincede apha.
I made a mistake.	Ndenza impazamo.
I mean really down.	Ndithetha ukuba phantsi ngokwenene.
But this will not always be the case.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuhlala kunjalo.
There is no turning back for me now.	Akukho kubuya emva kwam ngoku.
But that will take all day.	Kodwa oko kuya kuthatha imini yonke.
His permission, perhaps.	Imvume yakhe, mhlawumbi.
I thought you told him.	Bendicinga ukuba umxelele.
I don't want to talk about something like this.	Andifuni kuthetha ngento enje.
I want to know why you are here.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
I will tell him all your troubles.	Ndiya kumxelela yonke into embi yakho.
Lunch will be better.	Isidlo sasemini siya kuba ngcono.
He can't be fun here.	Akanakukwazi ukuba mnandi apha.
It seems a long time ago.	Kubonakala kudala.
My mother will be gone for a long time.	Umama uza kuba engekho ixesha elide.
Nobody did that and ran away with it.	Akukho mntu wayenza loo nto waza wabaleka nayo.
He looked away from her.	Ujonge kude kuye.
You told him there.	Umxelele apho.
A few hours.	Iiyure ezimbalwa.
You will do the right thing.	Uya kwenza into elungileyo.
He is about to speak.	Sele eza kuthetha.
He asked me what he was doing.	Wandibuza ukuba wenza ntoni na.
And you came to the wrong place.	Kwaye ufike kwindawo engalunganga.
For now, it’s a job for sure.	Okwangoku, ngumsebenzi ngokuqinisekileyo.
So again.	Ngoko kwakhona.
He always told me in the car.	Wandixelela njalo emotweni.
There is no reason for me to talk to him.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ndithethe naye.
We did all that.	Senze yonke loo nto.
That way we'll all be together, there.	Ngaloo ndlela sonke siya kuba kunye, apho.
But all will be well.	Kodwa konke kuya kuphumelela.
I doubt there is anyone inside.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kukho umntu ngaphakathi.
He has sat on top.	Uye wahlala phezulu.
He will go with us.	Uya kuhamba nathi.
I have to think, think.	Kufuneka ndicinge, ndicinge.
And now we need to build with him.	Ke ngoku kufuneka sakhe naye.
He was able to go to his office.	Wakwazi ukuya eofisini yakhe.
With that, he walked out.	Ngaloo nto, waphuma.
She loves to travel.	Uyathanda ukuhamba.
Well, that's right, for sure.	Ewe, kunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Of course, I can do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ndingayenza loo nto.
Walking this afternoon.	Ukuhamba ngale mvakwemini.
I would like to think that is true.	Ndingathanda ukucinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
This seems like it will be fun to do.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kuya kuba mnandi ukwenza.
But that did not really happen at the party.	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene epatini.
Really, one acted quickly.	Ngokwenene, omnye wenza ngokukhawuleza.
All friends.	Bonke abahlobo.
One, one, one.	Enye, enye, enye.
Not one dog, but two.	Hayi inja enye, kodwa ezimbini.
But you have to tell me what's going on.	Kodwa kufuneka undixelele ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I never thought I would have children.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ndibe nabantwana.
You know, you finally know how to do that.	Uyazi, ekugqibeleni uyayazi indlela yokwenza oko.
He is there to sing.	Ukhona ukucula.
That is exactly what he did not tell her.	Yiloo nto kanye engazange amxelele.
But he knows it all too well.	Kodwa uyazi kakhulu ngokupheleleyo.
He was looking for a way.	Wayefuna indlela.
You will be beautiful '.	Uya kuba mhle'.
I did not know anyone in town.	Ndandingazi mntu edolophini.
I think about it almost always.	Ndicinga ngayo phantse rhoqo.
Away from me.	Kude kum.
This is not clearly the case here.	Oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo apha.
I don't think he can sing.	Andiqondi ukuba uyakwazi ukucula.
I did not hear anyone.	Khange ndive mntu.
This means money.	Oku kuthetha imali.
He wants to do it.	Uyafuna ukuyenza.
You never thought of a good person.	Khange ucinge umntu olungileyo.
To make you go wrong.	Ukwenza uhambe kakubi.
Like, that's a new thing.	Njengokuba, yinto entsha leyo.
But you can't stop.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuyeka.
He can't even be the other way around.	Akanakukwazi nokuba abe ngenye indlela.
And that, yes.	Naloo nto, ewe.
He really tried to help.	Wazama ngokwenene ukunceda.
Do nothing until it is necessary.	Musa ukwenza nto de kube kufuneka.
Eventually he sat down to eat and about that.	Ekugqibeleni uye wahlala phantsi ukuba atye kwaye malunga naloo nto.
Lunch will be hard to finish on time.	Isidlo sasemini siya kuba nzima ukugqiba kwangethuba.
You should, maybe.	Ufanele ukuba, mhlawumbi.
Sorry this is too far.	Uxolo oku kude kakhulu.
He can't stop enough on his own.	Akakwazi ukuyeka ngokwaneleyo yedwa.
You do not have to go to the office.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uye e-ofisini.
Obviously, that is happening at this time.	Ngokucacileyo, oko kwenzeka ngeli xesha.
One day, something very unusual happened.	Ngenye imini, kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
And it is impossible.	Kwaye akunakwenzeka.
There is no reason why.	Akukho sizathu sokuba kutheni.
You have to be a great player here.	Kufuneka ube ngumdlali omkhulu apha.
I think that is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka oko.
I can do that, too.	Ndingayenza loo nto, nam.
Look back here.	Jonga emva apha.
My hat goes to you.	Umnqwazi wam uya kuwe.
Nothing, or no one.	Akukho nto, okanye akukho mntu.
He just wanted too bad for this to be true.	Wayefuna nje kakubi kakhulu ukuba oku kube yinyani.
What did I do? 	Ndenze ntoni?
And if he didn't.	Kwaye ukuba akazange .
It's hard to see the other way around.	Kunzima ukubona enye indlela.
I'm not into that.	Andikho ngaloo nto.
I know a lot about him.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngaye.
I don't want to be alone now.	Andifuni ukuba ndedwa ngoku.
Nobody wants to stay there.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala apho.
Of course, he was afraid.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wayesoyika.
Yes, we certainly know about it.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo siyazi ngayo.
There was no work with him.	Kwakungekho msebenzi naye.
Then more time.	Emva koko ixesha elingakumbi.
All right though.	Kulungile kodwa.
Now he knew for sure.	Ngoku wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
And, of course, everything is fine.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, yonke into ilungile.
But, at first, it is not easy.	Kodwa, ekuqaleni, akukho lula.
I didn't want to do anything.	Ndandingafuni kwenza nto.
And maybe they will go with it.	Kwaye mhlawumbi baya kuhamba nayo.
What will I do? 	Ndiza kwenza ntoni?
At first, it may be difficult.	Ekuqaleni, kunokuba nzima.
You will be here anyway.	Uzakuba lapha kunjalo.
Why is that???.	Kutheni kunjalo???.
That's what a gun is.	Yiloo nto umpu.
I'm so sorry .	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu .
Probably a book.	Mhlawumbi incwadi.
One day he did not want to leave the house.	Ngenye imini wayengafuni ukuphuma endlwini.
He has agreed to do so.	Uye wavuma ukwenjenjalo.
Let me learn something about him from someone else.	Makhe ndifunde enye into ngaye komnye umntu.
There was no way man.	Kwakungekho ndlela umntu .
You want one.	Ufuna enye.
He pleaded guilty.	Wavuma ityala.
I did not know how to do it.	Bendingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
Always, and again.	Njalo, kwaye kwakhona.
But some have.	Kodwa abanye baye.
I had to do it again and again.	Kwafuneka ndiphinde ndiphinde ndiphinde.
That could be you.	Inokuba nguwe lowo.
Well, maybe not so much.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi kangako.
Everything happened for lunch.	Yonke into yenzeke ngesidlo sasemini.
I wanted to tell you myself.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela ngokwam.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube yiyo.
I hope not that tonight.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo ngokuhlwanje.
We want to go there.	Sifuna ukuya apho.
I'm coming for you.	Ndiza kuwe.
Maybe you should look into this.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka ujonge oku.
This is really the thing.	Le yinto ngokwenene.
Is true!.	Yinyani!.
If you make a mistake, there is no problem.	Ukuba wenza impazamo, akukho ngxaki.
And there is no talking at this time.	Kwaye akukho kuthetha ngeli xesha.
And you don't want to know.	Kwaye awufuni ukwazi.
He went to dinner late.	Waya kwisidlo emva kwexesha.
But about all of that.	Kodwa malunga nayo yonke loo nto.
That's your time.	Lixesha lakho elo.
He was not far away.	Wayengekho kude.
He just made a speech.	Wenza nje intetho.
I do not remember exactly how.	Andikhumbuli ncam ukuba njani.
And now everything is fine.	Kwaye ngoku yonke into ilungile.
You can't stay here.	Awukwazi ukuhlala apha.
I'm sure I'm sorry about that.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ndiyaxolisa ngaloo nto.
We want music.	Sifuna umculo.
But this time it is different.	Kodwa ngeli xesha ngenye indlela.
We're going to have to go to town.	Kuza kufuneka siye edolophini.
I wanted to play more.	Ndandifuna ukudlala ngakumbi.
It would have seemed better to him.	Bekuya kubonakala ngcono kuye.
He sat in front of me, yes.	Wahlala phambi kwam, ewe.
I talked to him, okay.	Ndithethe naye, kulungile.
Sorry about that .	Uxolo ngalo nto .
Not the way we do it, of course.	Hayi indlela esenza ngayo, kunjalo.
I waited a long time.	Ndilinde ixesha elide.
We will have to do that.	Kuza kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
I want to do it.	Ndifuna ukwenza.
I should have stayed there.	Bekufanele ndihlale apho.
I really do.	Ngenene ndenza njalo.
The image is moving very fast.	Umfanekiso uhamba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I must be doing the right thing.	Kumele ukuba ndenza into elungileyo.
But it does not have to be this way.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube ngolu hlobo.
And you know, you might be right.	Kwaye uyazi, unokuba ulungile.
Each time he finished inside.	Ngalo lonke ixesha wagqiba ngaphakathi kwakhe.
Or he spoke.	Okanye wathetha.
But there is no danger in that.	Kodwa akukho ngozi kuloo nto.
It means no.	Kuthetha ukuba akukho.
He is planning something very wrong.	Uceba into embi kakhulu.
However, that will be very difficult at first.	Nangona kunjalo, oko kuya kuba nzima kakhulu ekuqaleni.
Suddenly, he looked away.	Ngokukhawuleza, wajonga ecaleni.
Finding something.	Ukufumana into.
He spoke easily.	Wathetha lula.
And then you make a decision.	Kwaye ke wenze isigqibo.
But we all know that is not the case.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I knew everyone in the class.	Ndandisazi wonke umntu eklasini.
Before we left.	Ngaphambi kokuba sihambe.
And because of you.	Kwaye ngokuba nawe.
I know, whatever happens.	Ndiyazi, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
It would be great if it was true.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani.
I certainly can't speak.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andikwazi kuthetha.
I tried again.	Ndazama kwakhona .
Not a picture.	Hayi umfanekiso.
We need one person.	Sifuna umntu omnye.
We want you to leave.	Sifuna uhambe.
Look for the truth.	Jonga inyaniso.
I will not say more than that.	Andisayi kuthetha ngaphezu koko.
But you know very well that.	Kodwa uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
I won't be, though.	Andiyi kuba, nangona kunjalo.
Why, he meant everything.	Kutheni, wayethetha yonke into.
Moreover, though.	Ngaphezu koko, nokuba.
I tried to think of it.	Ndazama ukucinga ngayo.
My job, you know.	Umsebenzi wam, uyazi.
Then it will be better.	Emva koko kuya kuba ngcono.
You can be in a few places at the same time.	Unokuba kwindawo ezimbalwa ngexesha elinye.
This is me .	Ndim lo .
Very, very soon.	Kakhulu, kungekudala.
Definitely a long wait.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukulinda ixesha elide.
But he thought he knew.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
The food ran out.	Kwaphela ukutya.
You are learning about that at school now.	Ufunda ngaloo nto esikolweni ngoku.
And he's wearing a coat again.	Kwaye unxibe idyasi kwakhona.
He felt better after that.	Waziva engcono emva koko.
You want to work hard.	Ufuna ukusebenza nzima.
If not please tell me.	Ukuba akunjalo nceda undixelele.
I do everything myself.	Ndenza yonke into ngokwam.
He said nothing to her.	Khange athethe nto kuye.
I don’t want to do too much with it.	Andifuni ukwenza kakhulu ngayo.
One day the cat will sit next to you.	Ngenye imini ikati iya kuhlala ecaleni kwakho.
And we have to really go.	Kwaye kufuneka sihambe ngenene.
All too much money.	Yonke imali eninzi kakhulu.
We'll see about this.	Siza kubona ngale nto.
I hope you know what it is.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
He knew he would be back.	Wayesazi ukuba uya kubuya.
He did not speak first.	Akazange athethe kuqala.
And look at things.	Kwaye jonga izinto.
You know what you need to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyenzile.
You've done enough for now.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo okwangoku.
I do a very good job.	Ndenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
There was nothing at all there.	Kwakungekho nto kwaphela apho.
I didn't have him.	Khange ndibe naye.
Help your friends.	Nceda abahlobo bakho.
But if so, it will be so.	Kodwa ukuba kunjalo, kuya kuba njalo.
You will not know.	Awuyi kukwazi.
You have to get there first.	Kufuneka ufike apho kuqala.
He got a very good job.	Wafumana umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
He lived for a few years.	Wahlala iminyaka embalwa.
His exit will not be good.	Ukuphuma kwakhe akuyi kuba kuhle.
And even if that is not the case at all.	Kwaye nokuba akunjalo konke.
It should have been me.	Bekufanele ukuba ndim.
I definitely wanted to succeed.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandifuna ukuphumelela.
Music speaks to me.	Umculo uthetha nam.
But he has to do other things.	Kodwa kufuneka enze ezinye izinto.
Outside, of course, for me.	Ngaphandle, kunjalo, kum.
Or even more difficult.	Okanye nokuba kunzima kakhulu.
But, it did not.	Kodwa, ayizange.
However you look at this in a negative light.	Nangona kunjalo ujonge oku ngendlela engalunganga.
Work will do that for you.	Umsebenzi uya kwenza oko kuwe.
I wondered what he was going to do.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
Impossible to imagine.	Akunakwenzeka ukucinga.
Maybe you bought something.	Mhlawumbi uthenge into.
He stayed at home as long as possible.	Wahlala ekhaya kangangoko.
Outside, perhaps, for you.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbi, kuwe.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuba naye.
I need someone here.	Ndifuna umntu apha.
However it is really true.	Nangona kunjalo ngokwenene inyani.
I'm not sure how.	Andazi ncam ukuba njani.
Some people have to go to the hospital.	Abanye abantu kufuneka baye esibhedlele.
Not that.	Akunjalo ukuba.
About being old.	Malunga nokuba mdala.
I wanted to try some.	Bendifuna ukuzama ezinye.
At this point, there is nothing.	Ngeli xesha, akukho nto.
It doesn't have to be pretty.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba mhle.
They live something.	Bahlala into.
There is nothing behind it.	Akukho nto ngasemva.
You probably do not know that such a problem exists.	Mhlawumbi awuyazi ukuba kukho ingxaki enjalo.
This time, however.	Ngeli xesha, nangona kunjalo.
I wonder if no one lives in it right now.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba akukho mntu uhlala kuyo ngoku.
He did it alone.	Wenza yedwa.
I don't need to say more.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe ngakumbi.
But you can't always win.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuphumelela lonke ixesha.
I certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo khange ndiyenze.
So that's all homework.	Ngoko ngumsebenzi wasekhaya wonke lowo.
We want to stay.	Sifuna ukuhlala.
But that will soon end.	Kodwa kungekudala oko kuya kuphela.
We need to know what's going on there.	Kufuneka siyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho.
So no one wanted to talk to us.	Ngoko akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nathi.
No waiting all night.	Akukho kulinda ubusuku bonke.
Or you need help.	Okanye ufuna uncedo.
He looked at his belongings.	Wajonga izinto zakhe.
Let me tell you about it.	Makhe ndikuxelele .
We have never been here.	Asizange sibe lapha.
Tom couldn't wait.	UTom akazange akwazi ukulinda.
Why yes, that's right.	Kutheni ewe, kunjalo.
He just didn't know.	Wayengazi nje.
Everyone is just lying on the floor.	Wonke umntu ulele nje phantsi.
Nobody wants that to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba oko kwenzeke.
It will be you.	Uza kuba nguwe.
And there is food.	Kwaye kukho ukutya.
And he didn't want to restrain himself.	Kwaye akazange afune ukuzibamba.
I think it will be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He does not like to stay here.	Akakuthandi ukuhlala apha.
She's scared, and that's fine.	Uyoyika, kwaye kulungile.
But a woman.	Kodwa umfazi .
Ran out of food.	Kwaphela konke ukutya.
On the side he made a party.	Ecaleni wenza itheko.
It can be powerful.	Inokuba ngamandla.
My only problem.	Ingxaki yam kuphela.
Come, too.	Uze, naye.
And then, like that, he's gone.	Kwaye ke, ngolo hlobo, uye wahamba.
He wanted me to leave.	Wayefuna ndihambe.
That, or stop now.	Oko, okanye yeka ngoku.
What three.	Yintoni abathathu.
And just about anything.	Kwaye malunga nantoni na.
So, finally, my mother.	Ngoko, ekugqibeleni, umama wam.
I did not want anyone to stay long.	Ndandingafuni mntu uhlale ixesha elide.
When you feel good, you look good !.	Xa uziva ulungile, ukhangeleka kakuhle!.
There is, however, this situation.	Kukho, nangona kunjalo, le meko.
But still the cat.	Kodwa nangoku ikati.
He would tell her more later.	Wayeza kumxelela ngakumbi kamva.
Really, these are more.	Ngokwenene, ezi ngakumbi.
I'm trying to walk.	Ndizama ukuhamba.
Probably, in one place.	Mhlawumbi, kwindawo enye.
He got into the car.	Wangena emotweni.
Just help me with him.	Ndincede nje naye.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube njalo.
I don't like to think.	Andiyithandi ukucinga.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiyo loo nto ngokwenene.
But he just didn't seem to do it.	Kodwa wayengabonakali nje ukuyenza loo nto.
In prison.	Entolongweni.
Yes, he does.	Ewe, uyayenza.
The only way to do it, though.	Indlela kuphela yokwenza, nangona kunjalo.
But it really can be, it can be anyone.	Kodwa ngokwenene inokuba njalo, inokuba nabani na.
So you have to look forward to it.	Ke unayo ukuba ujonge phambili kuyo.
Soon, she realized.	Kungekudala, waqonda.
We will sit down.	Siza kuhlala phantsi.
And he made it happen.	Kwaye uyenzile ukuba yenzeke.
Well there you told me.	Kulungile apho undixelele.
He spoke quickly.	Wathetha ngokukhawuleza.
He speaks well, and he tries hard.	Uthetha kakuhle, kwaye uzama ngamandla.
There is an error.	Kukho impazamo.
We did well though.	Senze kakuhle nangona kunjalo.
He will not be afraid.	Akayi kutya.
He never came to anyone, though he will.	Akazange eze nabani na, nangona uya kwenza.
As he would later say.	Njengoko wayeza kuthetha kamva.
I hope you do.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayenza.
Soon it will be time for me to leave.	Kungekudala iza kuba lixesha lokuba ndihambe.
I sit next to him.	Ndihlala ecaleni kwakhe.
I'm sure he would like to meet you.	Ndiqinisekile angathanda ukudibana nawe.
I did the same for another.	Ndenze njalo komnye.
You, and me.	Wena, kunye nam.
He never had it, and probably never did.	Akazange abe nayo, kwaye mhlawumbi akazange abe nayo.
But that's all.	Kodwa yonke loo nto.
And not inside, but outside.	Kwaye hayi ngaphakathi, kodwa ngaphandle.
We'll talk about it.	Siza kuthetha ngayo.
He too spoke in a strange way.	Naye wathetha ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
He was not, however.	Wayengekho, nangona kunjalo.
We want others.	Sifuna abanye.
It seems like yesterday to me.	Kubonakala ngathi izolo kum.
And it wasn't that hard.	Kwaye kwakungekho nzima ngolo hlobo.
I shall certainly return.	ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya.
There is no reason, except for me.	Akukho sizathu, ngaphandle kwam.
Or his daughter.	Okanye intombi yakhe.
And my week.	Kwaye iveki yam.
Please, please go.	Nceda, nceda uhambe.
I can't find the problem.	Andikwazi ukufumana ingxaki.
About any.	Malunga nayo nayiphi na.
The only problem.	Ingxaki kuphela .
In this.	Kule nto.
But he finished.	Kodwa wagqiba.
He is waiting outside.	Ulinde ngaphandle.
It can be a big deal.	Inokuba yinto enkulu.
This person has the same problem as you.	Lo mntu unengxaki efanayo nawe.
Only the truth now.	Inyani kuphela ngoku.
That will buy time.	Oko kuya kuthenga ixesha.
Just a word.	Ilizwi nje.
He knew he needed help.	Wayesazi ukuba ufuna uncedo.
I start at the bottom.	Ndiyaqala phantsi.
I'm sure we won't.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba asiyi.
And football, of course.	Kwaye ibhola, kunjalo.
I will not stay far away.	Andiyi kuhlala kude.
I deserve more than that.	Ndifanele ngaphezu koko.
Another came to him.	Omnye weza kuye.
I'm not sure anyone is doing it right now.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba nabani na wenza ngoku.
He thought he had succeeded then.	Wayecinga ukuba uphumelele ngoko.
I know one but not the other.	Ndiyazi enye kodwa hayi enye.
Beautiful new woman.	Umfazi omtsha omhle.
Others live with us.	Abanye bahlala nathi.
Then he heard the name.	Emva koko weva igama.
So there is another way.	Ngoko kukho enye indlela.
It seemed okay though.	Kwakubonakala ukuba kulungile kodwa.
I hope you retire.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuthatha umhlala-phantsi.
Before you can move forward, you need to make a decision.	Ngaphambi kokuba uye phambili, kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
You need to look at the case here.	Kufuneka ujonge ityala apha.
And they will do it again, maybe sooner rather than later.	Kwaye baya kuyenza kwakhona, mhlawumbi kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
But it doesn't have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba.
I didn't see anything else at first.	Andizange ndibone enye into ekuqaleni.
But you know the whole thing.	Kodwa uyayazi yonke loo nto.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
For, of course, he would be alone.	Kuba, ngokuqinisekileyo, wayeza kuba yedwa.
Just give me one word.	Ndinike nje igama elinye.
This will continue overnight.	Oku kuya kuqhubeka ubusuku bonke.
It should have been really good.	Bekufanele ukuba kuhle ngokwenene.
But you have another one.	Kodwa unayo enye.
He looked forward as he spoke.	Wajonga phambili xa ethetha.
You know, but it's my job.	Uyazi, kodwa ngumsebenzi wam.
He has done it all.	Uyenze yonke.
How long will it take ?.	Ingaba iza kuthatha ixesha elingakanani?.
He made a mistake and learned from it.	Wenza impazamo kwaye wafunda kuyo.
Maybe for all of us soon.	Mhlawumbi kuthi sonke kungekudala.
I think he will.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kuyenza.
You just want a chance.	Ufuna nje ithuba.
I just told you one.	Ndikuxelele nje enye.
There they lived all my life.	Apho bahlala ubomi bam bonke.
I want to talk to her, too.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye, nam.
In a restaurant.	Kwindawo yokutyela.
It's gone again.	Kuye kwakhona .
Everything will be new.	Yonke into iya kuba yinto entsha.
Look yesterday, look today.	Jonga izolo, jonga namhlanje.
There was no going forward now.	Kwakungekho ukuya phambili ngoku.
Maybe it was nothing to him.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho nto kuye.
I will do this again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
A little better.	Kancinci ngcono.
His name and so on.	Igama lakhe njalo njalo.
Things without me.	Izinto ngaphandle kwam.
And everyone looked at him.	Kwaye wonke umntu wajonga kuye.
Then he fell asleep.	Emva koko, walala.
But at the time, it seemed like a big deal.	Kodwa ngelo xesha, kwakubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
I'm not sure it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yiyo.
I know exactly what it is.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
For a long time, this time.	Ixesha elide, ngeli xesha.
I have to learn that.	Kufuneka ndifunde oko.
I will do it later.	Ndiza kuyenza kamva.
Yes you are.	Ewe, unjalo.
So he stays.	Ngoko uhlala.
We had to leave all the time.	Kwafuneka sihambe lonke ixesha.
It's all new.	Yinto yonke into entsha.
He knows where he lives.	Uyazi apho ahlala khona.
I suspect you probably do.	Ndiyarhana ukuba mhlawumbi uyayenza.
He walked back to the bed.	Wahamba wabuyela ebhedini.
And she is happy, she is scared.	Kwaye uyavuya, uyoyika.
Only now did he want more time.	Kuphela ngoku wayefuna ixesha elingakumbi.
He stayed with me through it all.	Wahlala nam kuyo yonke loo nto.
Great? 	Enkulu?
Only then should he be all or nothing.	Kuphela apho kufuneka abe konke okanye akukho nto.
You seem to know a lot.	Kubonakala ngathi wazi kakhulu.
I have never done anything like this myself.	Andizange ndenze into enje nam.
If you succeed, that’s fine and good.	Ukuba uphumelele, kulungile kwaye kulungile.
I never thought you should, no.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ufanele, hayi.
You are the only one for me.	Nguwe wedwa kum.
But nobody wants anyone to learn anything.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna ukuba umntu afunde nantoni na.
I want you to go with him.	Ndifuna uhamba naye.
But he could not stop things.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyeka izinto.
I hope today is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba namhlanje kulungile kuwe.
And thank you, for everything.	Kwaye enkosi, ngayo yonke into.
The same old house.	Indlu endala efanayo.
We know what this is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni le.
All together now.	Konke kunye ngoku.
Probably at that time.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba ngelo xesha.
She wants to have children.	Uyafuna ukuba nabantwana.
Maybe he can too.	Mhlawumbi naye unokuba njalo.
Maybe it would be good to wait a long time.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba kuhle ukulinda ixesha elide.
He wanted to say it.	Wayefuna ukuyithetha.
Yes, not today, but soon.	Ewe, hayi namhlanje, kodwa kungekudala.
Moreover, he spent a lot of time.	Ngaphezu koko, wachitha ixesha elide.
Anger at work.	Ukuba nomsindo emsebenzini.
So off he went.	Wahamba ke ngoko.
And he did this.	Kwaye wakwenza oku.
Thanks again.	Enkosi, kwakhona.
He finally lost his temper.	Ekugqibeleni akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
I would love to take a job.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuthatha umsebenzi.
He was unoccupied at the time.	Wayekade engekho mntu ngelo xesha.
I came here.	Ndize apha .
Everything will be easier.	Konke kuya kuba lula.
But, it never happened.	Kodwa, akuzange kwenzeke.
I will tell the truth.	Ndiza kuthetha inyani.
It's too far away.	Kude kakhulu ngokwenene.
I didn't see anything.	Andizange ndibone nto.
Then he took off his hat and hurried out.	Emva koko wathatha umnqwazi wakhe waphuma ngokukhawuleza.
You will stay for dinner and know everyone.	Uza kuhlala ngesidlo sangokuhlwa kwaye wazi wonke umntu.
It really should.	Ngenene kufuneka.
It happened yesterday.	Yenzeke izolo.
My mother wants nothing.	Umama akafuni kwanto.
For a few years everything is fine.	Iminyaka embalwa yonke into ilungile.
And you know you know it.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba uyayazi.
Not good, but good.	Hayi kakuhle, kodwa kulungile.
Well, we won't talk about that.	Kulungile, asiyi kuthetha ngaloo nto.
No, he did not come here.	Hayi, khange eze apha.
We will not do such a thing.	Asiyi kuyenza into enjalo.
Just like that.	Kanye ngolo hlobo.
It is up to you to decide.	Kuwe ukuba wenze isigqibo.
Two weeks today.	Iiveki ezimbini namhlanje.
Today at this time.	Namhlanje ngexesha le.
Probably no problem.	Mhlawumbi akukho ngxaki.
Not at first, but yes.	Hayi ekuqaleni, kodwa ewe.
He looked at his bed.	Wajonga ebhedini yakhe.
But, nevertheless, this is a great work.	Kodwa, nangona kunjalo, lo ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
Well, he never did.	Ewe, akazange akwenze oko.
We'll get to that here.	Siza kufika kuloo nto apha.
No he wasn't.	Hayi wayengekho.
I hope something new is coming.	Ndiyathemba into entsha ezayo.
I'll go, for the money.	Ndiza kuhamba, ngemali.
He did very well in it.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu kuyo.
He almost died this morning.	Uphantse wafa ngale ntsasa.
But don't go too far.	Kodwa musa ukuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
If you would like to do so.	Ukuba ungathanda ukwenza njalo.
To each other.	Ukuze omnye komnye.
But, above all, look up.	Kodwa, ngaphezu kwakho konke, jonga phezulu.
He didn't look so bad, he thought.	Wayengabonakali kakubi kangako, wacinga.
We'll see what's coming.	Siza kubona into ezayo.
It's a bad thing.	Yinto embi.
He went to the living room.	Waya kwindawo yokuhlala.
You love it, the whole thing.	Uyayithanda, yonke loo nto.
I wanted to do it well.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza kakuhle.
He just has to do it.	Kufuneka nje ayenze.
Everyone sat down again.	Wonke umntu wahlala phantsi kwakhona.
Although, today.	Nangona, namhlanje.
But he tried.	Kodwa wazama.
There has been a lot.	Kuye kwakho okuninzi.
I also want you to know that all is well.	Nam ndifuna wazi ukuba konke kulungile.
Not just next to him, but right next to him.	Hayi nje ecaleni kwakhe, kodwa kanye ecaleni kwakhe.
He kept thinking.	Wahlala wacinga.
In good time.	Ngexesha elihle.
There is such an answer for you.	Kukho impendulo enjalo kuwe.
It is time for this to happen.	Lixesha lokuba oku kwenzeke.
It will be difficult at first.	Kuza kuba nzima ekuqaleni.
It will come to me.	Iza kuza kum.
He'll just do it.	Uya kuyenza nje.
But he really knows what he wants.	Kodwa ngokwenene uyayazi into ayifunayo.
You did your thing.	Uyenzile into yakho.
Well obviously.	Kulungile kucacile.
I am not alone.	Andikho ndedwa.
Well, not at all, of course.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo, kunjalo.
I don't remember what it was.	Andikhumbuli ukuba yintoni.
All his friends.	Bonke abahlobo bakhe.
I really did.	Ngenene ndiyenzile.
And so for good reason.	Kwaye ke ngenxa entle kakhulu.
Then he got out of the car.	Emva koko wehla emotweni.
Nobody ever did that.	Akukho mntu wakha wenza njalo.
He did not tell me what had happened.	Khange andixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I will try to do better.	Ndiza kuzama ukwenza ngcono.
Something you need to do more.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile ngakumbi.
But you have done this before.	Kodwa ukhe wenza ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
I don't want to go right now.	Andifuni kuhamba okwangoku.
Until next time.	Kude kube lixesha elizayo.
I don't think she's scared.	Andiqondi ukuba uyoyika.
So he made a decision.	Ngoko wenza isigqibo.
I've seen a lot.	Ndibone kakhulu.
That's really hard.	Kunzima ngokwenene oko.
No one really knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene.
This had to be very difficult for her.	Oku kwafuneka kube nzima kakhulu kuye.
He did not go anywhere.	Akazange aye ndawo.
Then he left.	Emva koko, wahamba.
I don't want you to drive.	Andifuni uqhuba.
He was completely invisible.	Wayengabonakali kwaphela.
I wanted to know more.	Ndandifuna ukwazi okuninzi.
He has to be able to do it outside.	Kufuneka akwazi ukuyenza ngaphandle.
That will be the case with everything.	Kuya kuba njalo ngayo yonke into.
Or work, really.	Okanye umsebenzi, ngokwenene.
A woman can never.	Umfazi akanakuze.
He did not mention dinner last night.	Khange athethe ngesidlo sangokuhlwa phezolo.
He has to leave until tomorrow.	Ufanele ahambe kude kube kusasa.
I never thought it would be so good.	Zange ndicinge ukuba inokuba kuhle ngolu hlobo.
But he will soon come.	Kodwa kungekudala uza kuza.
It was more fun, really.	Kube mnandi ngakumbi, ngenene.
And there was no money at all.	Kwaye kwakungekho mali kwaphela.
He walked into the office.	Uye wangena eofisini.
That's a very special thing.	Yinto ethile kakhulu leyo.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukuyenza.
That seemed old-fashioned.	Oko kwakubonakala ngathi kudala.
Or maybe it's me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim.
I wanted to make a big picture.	Ndandifuna ukwenza umfanekiso omkhulu.
That’s why we want to move faster.	Yiyo loo nto sifuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I really want to learn.	Ndifuna kakhulu ukufunda.
You need to get to that point as soon as possible.	Kufuneka ufike kuloo nto ngokukhawuleza.
Then he decided to do just that.	Emva koko wagqiba kwelokuba enjenjalo.
So help anyone do it beforehand.	Ngoko nceda nabani na wenze ngaphambili.
And maybe my son.	Kwaye mhlawumbi unyana wam.
You have to do it anyway.	Kufuneka uyenze nokuba kunjalo.
And something happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into ethile.
I know what you want to talk about.	Ndiyayazi into ofuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Not at all, it is not.	Akunjalo konke konke, akunjalo.
It is something that happened at that time.	Yinto eyenzekayo ngelo xesha.
It does not happen overnight.	Asiyonto eyenzekayo ngokukhawuleza.
And no one really knows that.	Kwaye akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene loo nto.
My father is not always there.	Utata akakho njalo tu.
Neither should you.	Nawe akufanele ube njalo.
Death will be anything.	Ukufa kuya kuba nantoni na.
I know how hard it is at first.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani na ekuqaleni.
But one exception.	Kodwa enye ngaphandle.
Please stay with me.	Ndicela uhlale nam.
He thinks it is impossible.	Ucinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
But my mother does not want to.	Kodwa umama akafuni.
I just want to sit down for a bit.	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala phantsi kancinci.
He didn't want anyone to know he was here.	Wayengafuni nabani na ukuba azi ukuba ulapha.
But it really did not happen.	Kodwa ngokwenene akuzange kube njalo.
He spent the afternoon.	Wachitha emva kwemini.
I want you to be with me.	Ndifuna ukuba ube nam.
He knew everything about me.	Wayesazi yonke into ngam.
Come with it.	Uze nayo.
He only wanted peace.	Wayefuna uxolo kuphela.
But in this case.	Kodwa kule meko.
Another one.	Enye ethile.
Unless something is wrong.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho into embi.
One way to do this is to do it.	Enye indlela yokwenza oku.
However, before that it was very painful.	Nangona kunjalo, ngaphambi kokuba kube buhlungu kakhulu.
And he was not at home.	Kwaye wayengekho ekhaya.
He didn't want to do homework.	Wayengafuni ukwenza umsebenzi wesikolo.
He went in to her and lay with her.	Waya kuye waza walala naye.
This book is good.	Le ncwadi ilungile.
That will be today.	Oko kuya kuba namhlanje.
No, not this morning.	Hayi, hayi ngale ntsasa.
Obviously, nothing happened.	Ngokucacileyo, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
I hope to see your message soon.	Ndiyathemba ukubona umyalezo wakho kungekudala.
Please do a good job.	Nceda wenze umsebenzi olungileyo.
And they will want to succeed in this.	Kwaye baya kufuna ukuphumelela kule nto.
There is no way he knows.	Akukho ndlela azi ngayo.
It takes a long time to do that.	Kuthatha ixesha elide ukwenza oko.
He did not run for the day.	Akazange aqhube imini.
Everything in our town.	Yonke into yethu edolophini.
He would do something about it.	Wayeza kwenza into ngaloo nto.
Because there really is no problem here.	Kuba nyani akukho ngxaki apha.
Making a speech is hard enough.	Ukwenza intetho kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
Maybe he thought so too.	Mhlawumbi naye wayecinga ngolo hlobo ngaye.
Play is okay.	Ukudlala kulungile.
No one looked at anyone else.	Akukho mntu wajonga omnye umntu.
But he did not know.	Kodwa ke wayengazi.
I was thinking a word now.	Bendicinga ilizwi ngoku.
This is one person.	Ngumntu omnye lo.
This happened much faster.	Le yenzeke ngokukhawuleza ngakumbi.
Whatever that means.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni oko.
You will get your money back and then.	Uya kufumana imali yakho kwaye emva koko.
I can't have him home anymore.	Andikwazi ukuba naye ekhaya kwakhona.
Maybe three, but no more.	Mhlawumbi ezintathu, kodwa akukho ngaphezu koko.
I do a good job.	Ndenza umsebenzi omhle.
Money will come first.	Imali iza kuqala.
It might be fun you know.	Inokuba mnandi uyazi.
I always want to do something else.	Ndihlala ndifuna ukwenza enye into.
He said he does.	Wathi uyayenza.
That way you don't want to.	Ngaloo ndlela awufuni.
I hope it gets better now.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kungcono ngoku.
I know it's time for you to go.	Ndiyazi ukuba lixesha lokuba uhambe.
He understood more now what it could be.	Waqonda ngakumbi ngoku ukuba inokuba njani.
I already feel better.	Sele ndiziva ngcono.
There was no question at all.	Kwakungekho mbuzo kwaphela.
This may be difficult, but it is not possible.	Oku kunokuba nzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He told me about it.	Wandixelela ngayo.
But you are the only one at home.	Kodwa nguwe wedwa ekhaya.
He said there was no question about it.	Wathi akukho mbuzo malunga nayo.
I want us to be together.	Ndifuna sibe kunye.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku.
Now she said she liked it.	Ngoku wathi uyayithanda.
I needed time alone.	Ndandifuna ixesha ndedwa.
I just have to say this.	Kufuneka ndithethe nje oku.
But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngoko nangoko.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto mna.
But he tried anyway.	Kodwa wazama kunjalo.
He tried to stay.	Wazama ukuhlala.
I couldn't but.	Andikwazanga kodwa.
Something terrible is happening.	Kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
Nothing, though.	Akukho nto, nokuba.
Almost certainly not as many people as you would like.	Phantse ngokuqinisekileyo hayi abantu abaninzi njengoko unqwenela.
Our entire debt.	Ityala lethu ngokupheleleyo.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza .
I apologize for everything that happened.	Ndiyaxolisa ngento yonke eyenzekileyo.
He has gone completely.	Uye wahamba ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe you are ready to buy this.	Mhlawumbi ukulungele ukuthenga oku.
There is another car in the restaurant.	Kukho enye imoto kwindawo yokutyela.
To create a comfortable living space.	Ukwenza indawo entle yokuhlala.
Apparently he did.	Kubonakala ngathi wayenza.
So now you know how it happened.	Ngoko ngoku uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
However, it is well done.	Nangona kunjalo, yenziwe kakuhle.
It does not seem easy.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho lula.
It's too far, that way.	Kude kakhulu, ngaloo ndlela.
Unless you're talking to me.	Ngaphandle kokuba uthetha nam.
You don't look like that.	Awubonakali unjalo.
But he knew it was true.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba yinyani.
Nobody at all.	Akukho mntu kwaphela .
Many, many more.	Abaninzi, abaninzi ngakumbi.
You should have slept.	Bekufanele ukuba ulele.
You have to do it slowly.	Kufuneka uyenze kancinci.
He looked a little at her.	Wajonga kancinci naye.
I definitely thought this was it.	Ndacinga ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba yiyo le.
Faster better.	Ngokukhawuleza ngcono.
It's right there in front of you.	Ilungile apho phambi kwakho.
How do you know? 	Umele ukuba uyazi njani?
Very, very intelligent.	Kakhulu, ukrelekrele kakhulu.
I want to see a plan.	Ndifuna ukubona icebo.
That is something new.	Leyo yinto entsha.
Play is good for all ages.	Ukudlala kulungile kuyo yonke iminyaka.
I will definitely stay there again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuhlala apho kwakhona.
Today we are going to talk about who did that and why.	Namhlanje siza kuthetha ngokuba ngubani owenze loo nto kwaye kutheni.
And there was nobody there.	Kwaye kwakungekho mntu.
Two hours, then.	Iiyure ezimbini, ngoko.
He wants his father.	Ufuna utata wakhe.
He did very well there.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu apho.
The error will end this route.	Impazamo iza kuphela kule ndlela.
Every now and then.	Njalo nje ngoku kwaye.
He did not want to know everything about her.	Wayengafuni ukwazi yonke into ngaye.
And it happened so fast.	Kwaye kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
I'm just this though.	Ndim nje lo kodwa.
But no one talked too much.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayethetha kakhulu.
It certainly has to be done, though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka yenziwe, nangona kunjalo.
You did not.	Awuzange .
Or we will not.	Okanye asiyi.
And you don't have to do it.	Kwaye akufuneki uyenze.
Once at the top.	Kanye phezulu.
And finally, he wanted her to have it.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, wayefuna ukuba abe nayo.
And he is talking to us.	Kwaye uthetha nathi.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu tu apha.
He just walked in one.	Wangena nje enye.
But in the meantime you should consider.	Kodwa okwangoku kufuneka ucinge.
It seems like a very good idea.	Kubonakala ngathi licebo elihle kakhulu.
All night.	Ubusuku bonke.
But nothing, no one.	Kodwa akukho nto, akukho mntu.
But that is not possible for me.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka kum.
He works all day.	Usebenza imini yonke.
I want to know if it is possible.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
So this happened very quickly.	Ngoko, kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza oko.
There are others, though.	Kukho abanye, nangona kunjalo.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
Where are you right now?.	Ingaba uphi ngoku?.
Nothing too much.	Akukho nto kakhulu.
That's right, he thought.	Ilungile loo nto, wacinga.
I have thought and thought about it.	Ndiye ndacinga kwaye ndicinga ngayo.
It will probably happen differently.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
He just wanted to go there.	Wayefuna nje ukuya apho.
I'm going somewhere.	Ndiya kwindawo ethile.
It is not easy to find another place.	Akukho lula ukufumana enye indawo.
This will take time.	Oku kuza kuthatha ixesha.
I think that would look good.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kubonakala kulungile.
The little house behind him.	Indlu encinci emva kwakhe.
Look behind you.	Jonga ngasemva kwakho.
He knows everything about everyone.	Wazi yonke into ngaye wonke umntu.
And that will take money.	Kwaye oko kuya kuthatha imali.
That's it, all right.	Nantso into, kulungile.
I want forgiveness.	Ndifuna uxolo.
Intelligent and intelligent.	Ukrelekrele kwaye ukrelekrele.
I would have .	Ndiza kufumana .
And this again.	Kwaye oku kwakhona.
Do not do it until you are ready.	Musa ukuyenza de ube ulungile.
He did not have to do what he did.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ayenze loo nto ayenzileyo.
However, he did not stay in the same place for long.	Nangona kunjalo, akazange ahlale kwindawo enye ixesha elide.
It will be difficult to tell.	Kuya kuba nzima ukuxelela.
I tried, though.	Ndazama, nangona kunjalo.
Soon we will get better.	Kungekudala siza kuba ngcono.
Doing good work.	Ukwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
Look everything is fine.	Jonga yonke into ilungile.
No, you are not.	Hayi, awuyi.
Please, you must.	Siza, kufuneka.
I really want that.	Ndifuna kakhulu loo nto.
He didn't want to, at first.	Wayengafuni, ekuqaleni.
And he did.	Kwaye wenza njalo .
Not so fast, there.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza, apho.
But the work fled.	Kodwa umsebenzi wabaleka.
He did not want to talk about it.	Akazange afune ukuthetha ngayo.
And now it's not there.	Kwaye ngoku akukho apho.
Good to know.	Kuhle nje ukwazi.
Before that, you need to know a few things.	Ngaphambi koko, kufuneka wazi izinto ezimbalwa.
This happens here every day.	Oku kwenzeka apha yonke imihla.
The same thing happened there.	Kwenzeka into efanayo apho.
Just look a little bit.	Jonga nje kancinci.
My three years.	Iminyaka yam emithathu.
Little did I know that it would be so fun.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuya kuba mnandi kangako.
I saw how it could be.	Ndabona ukuba inokuba njani.
It only goes well.	Uhamba kakuhle kuphela.
Maybe a week or two.	Mhlawumbi iveki okanye ezimbini.
He has entered the house.	Uye wangena endlini.
He will not be, for your sake.	Akayi kuba, ngenxa yakho.
You must be tired.	Ufanele ukuba udiniwe.
And everyone wants this.	Kwaye wonke umntu ufuna oku.
If you have money, fine.	Ukuba unayo imali, kulungile.
I hope you are ready.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ukulungele.
And it never happened.	Kwaye ayizange yenzeke.
It is, of course.	Yinto, kunjalo.
My mother never talked about it.	Umama akazange athethe ngayo.
The picture is very meaningful.	Umfanekiso uthetha kakhulu.
I did not want to leave.	Bendingafuni ukuhamba.
You are always thinking.	Uhlala ucinga.
That will be really hard to find.	Oko kuya kuba nzima ngokwenene ukufumana.
Because there is nothing, there is nothing.	Ngenxa yokuba akukho nto, akukho nto.
Stop working on everything else.	Yeka ukusebenza kuyo yonke enye into.
I never thought why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kwakutheni.
But eventually that happened.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kwenzeka loo nto.
He said yes, of course, he understood.	Wathi ewe, kunjalo, uye waqonda.
She only received flowers once.	Wafumana iintyatyambo kanye kuphela.
Eventually he came back to me.	Ekugqibeleni uye wabuyela kum.
But yes, a long story.	Kodwa ewe, ibali elide.
I would like to die.	Ndingathanda ukufa.
Inside me.	Ngaphakathi kum.
He was not in town at the time.	Wayengekho edolophini ngelo xesha.
Work is good, if you are busy.	Umsebenzi ulungile, ukuba uxakekile.

So far everything is fine.	Okwangoku konke kulungile.
For a long time, really.	Ixesha elide, ngokwenene.
How do you feel about that ?.	Uziva njani ngalonto?.
If you do.	Ukuba uyayenza.

Whatever it really is.	Nokuba yintoni na ngokwenene.
This money will last a long time.	Le mali iya kuhlala ixesha elide.
Please, this way.	Nceda, ngale ndlela.
Thank you, thank you for everything.	Enkosi, enkosi ngayo yonke into.
They go there.	Baya apho.
He walks at night.	Uhamba ebusuku.
When it's right, it's really right.	Xa ilungile, ilungile ngokwenene.
Don't go to school.	Musa ukuya esikolweni.
Me and my children.	Mna nabantwana bam.
Please think now.	Nceda, ucinge ngoku.
It's completely new.	Yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo.
Why this.	Kutheni le nto.
Nowhere.	Akakho ndawo.
I know now that I have gone a little better.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba ndihambe ngcono kancinci.
But I do not understand how.	Kodwa andiqondi ukuba njani.
You already know the answer.	Sele uyayazi impendulo.
I just think it's weird.	Ndicinga nje ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
You did this.	Nguwe owenze lento.
He wants to be with you.	Ufuna ukuba nawe.
Who wants to try that ?.	Ngubani ofuna ukuzama loo nto?.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku .
For all of us.	Ngenxa yethu sonke.
Good on you for that.	Kuhle kuwe ngaloo nto.
I'll get to it later.	Ndiza kufika kuyo kamva.
Home then, if so.	Ekhaya emva koko, ukuba kunjalo.
Staying here and now.	Ukuhlala apha kwaye ngoku.
And there is no reason at all.	Kwaye akukho sizathu nanini na.

Yes, he did.	Ewe, waqonda.
You will see how it will happen.	Uya kubona ukuba kuya kwenzeka njani.

He had to think about it.	Kwafuneka acinge ngayo.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He just looked.	Uye wajonga nje.
If that is what he wanted to be.	Ukuba yiloo nto wayefuna ukuba yiyo.
That's what he's talking about.	Yiloo nto ethetha ngayo yonke loo nto.
If not, that would be fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, oko kuya kulungile.
And flowers, of course.	Kwaye iintyatyambo, kunjalo.
He is always absent.	Uhlala engekho.
You will have to go with us.	Kuya kufuneka uhambe nathi.
In the office all day.	Eofisini imini yonke.
I'm glad to try this.	Ndiyavuya ukuzama le.
He likes to do that.	Uyathanda ukuyenza loo nto.
You cannot do one or the other.	Awukwazi ukwenza enye okanye enye.
And it is not necessary.	Kwaye akufuneki.
It's hard, it really is.	Kunzima, kunjalo ngokwenene.
I can't say anything right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto ngoku.
Her mother looked up, too.	Umama wakhe wajonga phezulu, naye.
There is only one or the other.	Kukho enye kuphela okanye enye.
Maybe a slow move.	Mhlawumbi ukuhamba kancinci.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kufuneka uhlale uzama ukwenza izinto.
Maybe help.	Mhlawumbi uncedo.
Talking is not necessary.	Ukuthetha akuyomfuneko.
You have done this before.	Ukhe wenza ngale ndlela ngaphambili.
He has really done something wrong to you.	Wenze kakubi ngenene ngawe.
That's wrong.	Yiloo nto engalunganga.
He did a good job with it, too.	Wenza umsebenzi olungileyo ngayo, naye.
I'm going there now.	Ndiya khona ngoku.
But he knew, he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi, wayesazi.
But it is difficult to remain optimistic.	Kodwa kunzima ukuhlala unethemba.
You can be anyone you want to be.	Unokuba nabani na ofuna ukuba nguye.
He thought he would do it.	Wacinga ukuba uya kwenza.
You work your whole life to get here.	Usebenza ubomi bakho bonke ukuze ufike apha.

This should be the case, because this is very obvious.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo, kuba oku kubonakala kakhulu.
He looked completely out of sight.	Wajonga ngaphandle ngokupheleleyo.
I’m not sure what or what.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni okanye yintoni na.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbi kuphela oko.
Two or three hours.	Iiyure ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
We need to go there now.	Kufuneka siye apho ngoku.
But, after all, it probably isn't.	Kodwa, emva koko, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Death is like that.	Ukufa kunjalo.
I know my place.	Ndiyayazi indawo yam.
That's all we need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka siyazi.
I'm not sure what exactly this is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni kanye le.
But he had to come in.	Kodwa kwafuneka angene.
But please think about it please.	Kodwa ndicela ucinge ngayo nceda.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Mhlawumbi akacingi njalo.
However, that did happen.	Nangona kunjalo, oko kwenzeka.
Good to have you.	Kuhle ukuba nawe.
And we want it to be fun.	Kwaye sifuna kube mnandi.
Yes and you.	Ewe nawe.
I did nothing.	Khange ndenze nto.
But just seeing.	Kodwa ukubona nje.
Or his person.	Okanye umntu wakhe.
We all have to go.	Kufuneka sihambe sonke.
I don't think this will work.	Andiqondi ukuba oku kuya kuphumelela.
But he knew that this was impossible.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
If there is something good about him or her.	Ukuba kukho into entle kuye okanye ngaye.
You're busy right.	Uxakekile ulungile.
I feel so much better too.	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu nam.
She's a little dressed now.	Unxibe kancinci ngoku.
He didn't tell me about you with him last night.	Khange andixelele ngawe naye phezolo.
But, in the end, we will be together.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, siya kuba kunye.
She will have to be in him.	Kuya kufuneka abe kuye.
Nothing should happen to you.	Akukho nto kufuneka yenzeke kuwe.
He felt something had to be done.	Waziva kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe.
You need to know something.	Kufuneka uyazi into.
It is even harder to get out.	Kunzima ngakumbi ukuphuma.
It must have been something he did last night.	Inokuba yinto ayenzileyo phezolo.
Everything is fine after that.	Yonke into ilungile emva koko.
You will be able to come every day.	Uya kukwazi ukuza yonke imihla.
He wants us to go there tonight.	Ufuna siye phaya ngokuhlwanje.
He almost became a doctor.	Uphantse waba ngugqirha.
I can't be with you.	Andikwazi ukuba nawe.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe nto ingako.
So thank you everyone for being here.	Ngoko enkosi wonke umntu ngokuba lapha.
And there are your ages.	Kwaye kukho iminyaka yakho.
I just don’t see how it is.	Andiboni nje ukuba njani.
I mean everyone.	Ndithetha wonke umntu.
But the truth comes with time.	Kodwa ke inyaniso iza kunye nexesha.
I want you to do this.	Ndifuna wenze oku.
But you will see nothing.	Kodwa awuyi kubona nto.
Even if that means traveling alone.	Nokuba oko kuthetha ukuhamba wedwa.
So you can do all that.	Ngoko ungayenza yonke loo nto.
Everyone should stay together.	Wonke umntu kufuneka ahlale kunye.
That's old.	Oko kudala.
This he will never do here.	Le akanakuze ayenze apha.
Very helpful, thank you very much.	Uncedo kakhulu, enkosi kakhulu.
They will want to meet you.	Baza kufuna ukudibana nawe.
What happened, but not always.	Kwenzeke ntoni, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
Your marriage will be better.	Umtshato wakho uya kuba ngcono.
I did not commit any crime.	Andizange ndenze ityala.
That situation did not happen.	Loo meko ayizange yenzeke.
Maybe that happened to me.	Mhlawumbi oko kwenzeka kum.
I do not want to be without you.	Andifuni kuba ngaphandle kwakho.
Yes she does.	Ewe wenza njalo.
Yes, eating food.	Ewe, ukutya ukutya.
He is here this morning.	Ulapha ngale ntsasa.
I just know you are.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba unjalo.
Not without you.	Hayi ngaphandle kwakho.
I wonder how long it will last.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kuya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Not in that.	Hayi kuloo nto.
He must learn to speak.	Kufuneka afunde ukuthetha.
Almost anything a lot.	Phantse nantoni na eninzi.
Or maybe all of them.	Okanye mhlawumbi wonke.
He left and went.	Wemka wahamba.
I don’t know how you feel about him.	Andazi ukuba uziva njani ngaye.
And this is not the case here.	Kwaye oku akunjalo apha.
Really, really down.	Ngokwenene, phantsi ngokwenene.
He has to go inside.	Kufuneka angene ngaphakathi.
He pulled out his liquor.	Wakhupha utywala bakhe.
Mom did a little bit, at first.	Umama wenza kancinci, ekuqaleni.
He said they would be.	Wathi baya kuba njalo.
He wants to know what you did.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni na.
I never learned how to do it.	Andizange ndifunde indlela yokwenza.
That's all you need to know now.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi ngoku.
Just like that, he asked for more money.	Kanye ngolo hlobo, wacela enye imali.
What the heck.	Yintoni le embi.
Now it will be very difficult.	Ngoku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Or impossible.	Okanye akunakwenzeka.
Although you may be sad about that.	Nangona unokuba buhlungu ngaloo nto.
He also did not go.	Naye akayi.
You know a little bit.	Uyazi kancinci.
And one far away.	Kwaye enye kude.
So that's the thing.	Ngoko nantso into.
He did not stop speaking.	Akazange ayeke ukuthetha.
I just didn’t know about him.	Ndandingazi nje ngaye.
But then he came home.	Kodwa ke weza ekhaya.
I wanted to think but not too much.	Bendifuna ukucinga kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He was going to be old.	Wayeza kuba mdala .
We will go with it.	Siza kuhamba nayo.
He did not try to make friends.	Akazange azame ukwenza abahlobo.
He made it happen.	Wenza ukuba kwenzeke.
But she could not stop.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyeka.
I just know it is.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba kunjalo.
I never knew.	Andizange ndiyazi.
Or really life, time.	Okanye ngokwenene ubomi, ixesha.
You think you know, but you can't imagine.	Ucinga ukuba uyazi, kodwa awukwazi ukucinga.
And maybe because.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ngenxa.
He wanted her again.	Wayefuna ukuba aphinde.
I will never come back.	Andiyi kubuya kwakhona .
Well done for coming so far, she thought.	Wenze kakuhle ukuza kude kangaka, wacinga njalo.
You must have done well.	Umele ukuba wenze kakuhle.
You learn from it.	Ufunda kuyo.
But it almost never happened.	Kodwa phantse ayizange yenzeke.
But either way is right for me.	Kodwa nayiphi na indlela ilungile kum.
I just can't finish.	Andikwazi nje ukugqiba.
You must be moving fast.	Kumele ukuba uhamba ngokukhawuleza.
If he has done this once, he can do it again.	Ukuba uyenzile le nto kube kanye, angayenza kwakhona.
It will be.	Iya kuba yiyo.
But this one is so cute.	Kodwa lo mhle kakhulu.
All the more reason to swim here.	Sonke isizathu ngakumbi ukuqubha apha.
And clearly this.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo oku.
Not a bad thing to do.	Hayi into embi ukuyenza.
My wife has been away before.	Umfazi wam ukhe wahamba ngaphambili.
You may be moving further.	Usenokuba uhamba ngakumbi.
I have to give something.	Kufuneka ndinike into.
The answer is no.	Impendulo kukuba mhlawumbi akunjalo.
One did the other.	Omnye wenza enye.
However, enough to say.	Nangona kunjalo, ngokwaneleyo ukuthetha.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangako.
We will be the first.	Siya kuba ngowokuqala.
I don't have to think about it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndicinge ngayo.
It's just that the focus is hard on that.	Yinto nje ukuba ingqalelo nzima kuloo nto.
He looked at the picture for a long time.	Wajonga umfanekiso ixesha elide.
I will do everything for you.	Ndiza kuyenza yonke into kuwe.
If not, you will do so.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kwenza njalo.
I needed his help.	Bendifuna uncedo lwakhe.
It is very difficult to know for sure.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He goes to prison.	Uya entolongweni.
I've heard of him.	Ndikhe ndeva ngaye.
I have been able to talk about this for years.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha ngale nto iminyaka.
Bad dog, bad dog, you will say.	Inja embi, inja embi, uya kuthi.
You feel like you have to talk, talk.	Uziva kufuneka uthethe, uthethe.
Then he tried to stay.	Emva koko wazama ukuhlala.
I wanted so much.	Ndandifuna kakhulu.
And, of course, there are others.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, kukho abanye.
That's all, really.	Yiloo nto kuphela, ngokwenene.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi kuyenza loo nto.
But again, it's not about that.	Kodwa kwakhona, akukho malunga naloo nto.
He and I.	Naye kunye nam.
He is, there is no question at all.	Nguye, akukho mbuzo kwaphela.
Clearly, he was afraid.	Kucacile ukuba wayesoyika.
He has to be with me.	Kufuneka abe nam.
Or you do it because you feel good.	Okanye uyenza kuba uziva ulungile.
I did not know that.	Bendingayazi ke mna lonto.
I don't see anything about him.	Andiboni nto ngaye.
Thinking of me, every day for a long time.	Ukucinga ngam, yonke imihla ixesha elide.
Now he is really scared.	Ngoku woyika ngokwenene.
You will find a better place.	Uya kufumana indawo engcono.
Well, you just did it.	Ewe, uyenzile nje.
I arrived immediately and came here.	Ndifike kwangoko ndize apha.
Nothing was coming to him.	Kwakungekho nto iza kuye.
I speak badly.	Ndithetha kakubi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
Yes, you feel good.	Ewe, uziva ulungile.
Why this, no one knows for sure.	Kutheni le nto, akukho mntu wazi kakuhle.
Really, well done.	Ngokwenene, yenziwe kakuhle.
She was afraid of everything about him.	Wayesoyika yonke into ngaye.
Driving to work.	Ukuqhuba ukuya emsebenzini.
That is what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo leyo.
There you are alone now.	Kukho wena wedwa ngoku.
Maybe it will be better tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono kusasa.
All right, soon.	Kulungile, kungekudala.
Better music.	Umculo olungileyo ngakumbi.
I'll get to you soon.	Ndiza kuza kuwe ngokukhawuleza.
He certainly has to think about everything.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka acinge ngayo yonke into.
It means a lot really.	Kuthetha okuninzi ngokwenene.
I decided.	Ndenze isigqibo.
One at the hospital.	Omnye esibhedlele.
But he certainly is.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo unjalo.
But not because of you.	Kodwa akukho ngenxa yakho.
I feel more.	Ndiziva ngakumbi.
But they will do it.	Kodwa baya kuyenza.
Good, good book.	Incwadi entle, entle.
Moreover, this is not necessary.	Ngaphezu koko, oku akuyomfuneko.
You better be.	Kungcono ube.
It’s better to know for sure, though.	Kungcono ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo, nangona kunjalo.
Two weeks too.	Iiveki ezimbini kakhulu.
I like that .	Ndiyayithanda lo nto .
Stop thinking about it.	Yeka ukucinga ngayo.
This is very difficult here.	Oku kunzima kakhulu apha.
Or do anything.	Okanye wenze nantoni na.
We now know why.	Siyazi ngoku ukuba kutheni.
I don't want to talk too much.	Andifuni kuthetha kakhulu.
A nice little thing, he is, too.	Into encinci entle, unjalo, naye.
I had no idea who it might be or what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba ngubani okanye yintoni na.
I'm still looking at him.	Ndijonge kuye nangoku.
I wanted to stay here.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala apha.
There was no place for him without her.	Kwakungekho ndawo yakhe ngaphandle kwakhe.
It really happened to me.	Ngokwenene kwenzeka kanye kum.
I will have to go.	Kuya kufuneka ndihambe.
He pretends not to know.	Wenza ngathi akazi.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Wathi ufuna ukuthetha nam.
Right here in the back.	Kanye apha emva.
No no, no yes.	Hayi hayi, hayi ewe.
It could be him, you know.	Inokuba nguye, uyazi.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe yinyani leyo.
But if you want to, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba uyafuna, kulungile.
One day, but not now.	Ngenye imini, kodwa hayi ngoku.
Probably my whole life, you know.	Mhlawumbi ubomi bam bonke, uyazi.
But then it comes to me.	Kodwa ke iza kum.
I can't talk to anyone.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye nabani na.
You are the one who looks bad.	Nguwe lo ukhangeleka kakubi.
Looks like he can't sit still.	Kubonakala ngathi akakwazi ukuhlala phantsi.
But not before.	Kodwa hayi ngaphambili.
And look at my death.	Kwaye jonga ukufa kwam.
I arrived first, but just.	Ndifike kuqala, kodwa nje.
It should mean that.	Kufuneka kuthetha ukuba.
Something happened in the house.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo endlwini.
He was not hard to see.	Akazange kube nzima ukubona.
We want a reason.	Sifuna isizathu.
I hope you will try this soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuzama oku kungekudala.
There is no restaurant.	Akukho ndawo yokutyela.
He almost never succeeded at all.	Uphantse akazange aphumelele konke konke.
I also help other people.	Ndiphinde ndincede abanye abantu.
He will definitely be here tonight.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uzakuba lapha ngokuhlwanje.
I wanted to do that for a long time.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza loo nto ixesha elide.
But the mind can be even more difficult.	Kodwa ingqondo inokuba nzima ngakumbi.
And you've stayed long enough to know the truth.	Kwaye uhleli ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo ukuba wazi inyani.
Her mother is there.	Umama wakhe ukhona.
You always get better and better.	Uhlala ungcono kwaye ungcono.
I want more.	Ndifuna okuninzi ngakumbi.
Not just in the morning.	Hayi nje ekuseni.
He soon realized.	Ngokukhawuleza waqonda.
There you are.	Nawe apho.
He did not do any.	Akazange enze namnye.
And maybe for you.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kuwe.
That, obviously, is not the case.	Oko, ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
His work is good.	Umsebenzi wakhe mhle.
We will never have it.	Soze sibe nayo.
No one has been sleeping there lately.	Akukho mntu uye walala apho mva nje.
I'm not sure where the problem is right now.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iphi ingxaki okwangoku.
I will say this, however.	Ndiza kuthetha oku, nangona kunjalo.
Not a gun.	Hayi umpu.
All the time, in everything.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, kuyo yonke into.
I'm not sure you're right.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ulungile.
There is something to be done there, though.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe phaya, nangona kunjalo.
And you know, okay.	Kwaye uyazi, kulungile.
She is smart and scared.	Ukrelekrele kwaye uyoyika.
Are you busy.	Uxakekile.
The father has to go.	Utata kufuneka ahambe.
Probably not necessarily.	Mhlawumbi akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
I think about you all the time.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
You might be looking a little bit.	Inokuba ujonge kancinci .
Really, that is not the case.	Ngokwenene, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
Many will go far.	Abaninzi baya kude.
But what is that.	Kodwa yintoni na loo nto.
Look there first.	Ujonge apho kuqala.
He makes it easy for her.	Uyenza lula kuye.
And it is true that you are a real child.	Kwaye yinyani ukuba ngumntwana ngokwenene.
I'm talking a little too much about it.	Ndithetha kancinci kakhulu ngayo.
He says nothing.	Uthi akukho nto.
You told me that today.	Undixelele lonto namhlanje.
You have reached the end.	Ufike ekugqibeleni.
He said they did not.	Wathi abazange.
And that was obvious.	Kwaye oko kwakucacile.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukwenza into.
He lives there.	Uhlala phaya.
They would argue.	Wangena utata.
You look like you want one.	Ukhangeleka ngathi ufuna enye.
But he is doing it now.	Kodwa wenza ngoku.
This happened recently.	Oku kwenzeke mva nje.
It will be difficult at first.	Kuya kuba nzima ekuqaleni.
There is little truth in this.	Kukho inyaniso encinci kule nto.
If it is, it is.	Ukuba nguye, nguye.
He decided then.	Wagqiba ngoko.
Well, you should know what this is all about.	Ewe, kufuneka wazi ukuba yintoni na le nto.
But he certainly did not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
Maybe that was obvious.	Mhlawumbi oko kwakucacile.
We need help with everything.	Sifuna uncedo kuyo yonke into.
But he died soon afterward.	Kodwa wafa ngoko nangoko emva koko.
Not everyone is.	Ayinguye wonke umntu lowo.
I think at the same time.	Ndicinga ngexesha elinye.
Don't just read this book.	Musa nje ukufunda le ncwadi.
It is necessary.	Kufuneka .
Everyone really wants to be with you.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba nawe ngokwenene.
One, and one.	Enye, kwaye enye.
He will certainly speak a word to anyone.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuthetha ilizwi kuye nabani na.
Another word.	Elinye ilizwi.
He never drove a car.	Akazange nanini na aqhube imoto.
Thank you so much for being with us.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba nathi.
We all need to move forward.	Sonke kufuneka siye phambili.
I could no longer do anything.	Andizange ndiphinde ndikwazi ukwenza nantoni na.
Only your speech.	Kuphela intetho yakho.
He always says this.	Usoloko ethetha oku.
He always is.	Usoloko unjalo.
But not far behind.	Kodwa hayi kude ngasemva.
There was no one to talk to.	Kwakungekho mntu uthetha naye.
The gun is ready.	Umpu ulungile.
He hoped he deserved it.	Wayenethemba lokuba ufanele.
No, maybe, more.	Hayi, mhlawumbi, ngakumbi.
Once, once.	Kanye, kube kanye.
Nobody ever thought of doing that.	Akukho mntu wakha wacinga ukwenjenjalo.
Death every day.	Ukufa yonke imihla.
He lay down at school.	Walala phantsi esikolweni.
He wanted his mind.	Wayefuna ingqondo yakhe.
But still thank you.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo enkosi.
Please sit down again.	Nceda uhlale phantsi kwakhona.
I had to see.	Kwafuneka ndibone.
Really, you have to go now.	Ngokwenene, kufuneka uhambe ngoku.
You do not have to keep talking.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhlale uthetha.
Yeah, okay, okay.	Ewe, kulungile, kulungile.
He never owned another car.	Akazange abe enye imoto.
But first you have to stay.	Kodwa kuqala kufuneka uhlale.
But seeing something completely different.	Kodwa ukubona enye into ngokupheleleyo.
I like speech.	Ndiyayithanda intetho.
Good play does.	Ukudlala kakuhle kwenza.
Now you have to go to college.	Ngoku kufuneka uye ekholejini.
He talks like that.	Uthetha ngolo hlobo.
I hope we will see a few things.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kubona izinto ezimbalwa.
He says we will succeed.	Uthi siya kuphumelela.
It would just take a lot of time.	Bekuya kuthatha nje ixesha elininzi.
My mother sits in the back.	Umama uhlala ngasemva.
I would love to go out with you.	Ndingathanda ukuphuma kunye nawe.
Just like you did with me.	Kanye njengokuba wenza nam.
Maybe you talk about it.	Mhlawumbi uthetha ngayo.
However, it is better than nothing.	Nangona kunjalo, kungcono kunokuba akukho nto.
But he asked.	Kodwa wabuza.
I know you're really busy.	Ndiyayazi ukuba uxakekile nyani.
thinking about you!.	ndicinga ngawe!.
And, she never had children.	Kwaye, akazange abe nabantwana.
He did not want to go out like this.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma ngale ndlela.
He seemed alone.	Wayebonakala eyedwa.
He does it at home.	Uyenza ekhaya.
I will tell him something.	Ndiza kumxelela into.
This can actually be.	Oku kunokuba ngokwenene.
He knew he was right.	Wayesazi ukuba ulungile.
You want something from me.	Ufuna into kum.
This is a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene le.
He will definitely be here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uzakuba lapha.
This is everyday, too.	Oku yonke imihla, kakhulu.
Dad can be very difficult.	Utata unokuba nzima kakhulu.
He did not even know why he was here.	Wayengazi nokuba kutheni elapha.
I am here for lunch.	Ndilapha ngesidlo sasemini.
Yes, you can do the same.	Ewe, nawe ungayenza loo nto.
I like that about her.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto kuye.
Then you go for a long time.	Emva koko uhamba ixesha elide.
But now it's time for me to go.	Kodwa ngoku lixesha lokuba ndihambe.
No one goes to him no.	Akukho mntu uya kuye hayi.
And now what.	Ke ngoku ntoni .
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kuya kuba njalo.
And it will be this time.	Kwaye kuya kuba njalo ngeli xesha.
He has to stay that way.	Kufuneka ahlale enjalo.
And so, he told me the other day.	Kwaye ke, wandixelela ngenye imini.
Very good, yes.	Kuhle kakhulu, ewe.
He would go on alone.	Wayeza kuqhubeka yedwa.
It is many years old.	Kudala iminyaka emininzi.
That's the way to do it.	Nantso indlela yokwenza oko.
But he is not visible.	Kodwa akabonakali.
And not just for him.	Kwaye hayi ngaye kuphela.
Probably immediately.	Mhlawumbi ngoko nangoko.
You can be a better person.	Unokuba ngumntu ongcono.
You feel great.	Uziva kakhulu.
He would do all the questions.	Wayeza kwenza yonke imibuzo.
We will not just be.	Asiyi kuba nje.
Doing this for everyone.	Ukwenza oku kuye wonke umntu.
We know you will succeed.	Siyazi ukuba uya kuphumelela.
I will be in it eventually.	Ndiza kuba kuyo ekugqibeleni.
Whenever anything happened, there was nothing.	Nanini na xa kukho nantoni na eyenzekayo, kwakungekho nto.
I'll tell her, then.	Ndiza kumxelela, ngoko.
Clearly he should not have driven.	Kucacile ukuba bekungafanelanga ukuba aqhube.
It's hard to say now.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngoku.
If not today, tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngomso.
I will have to learn more about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndifunde ngakumbi ngayo.
In front of me.	Phambili kwam.
Not a bad place to be.	Hayi indawo embi ukuba ube kuyo.
And it's not fun at all.	Kwaye akukho mnandi kwaphela.
We did not make anyone.	Asizange senze mntu.
I tried to find that way.	Ndazama ukufumana loo ndlela.
You can't find something wrong.	Awukwazi ukufumana into engalunganga.
It's a little okay.	Kulungile kancinci.
About us, of course.	Malunga nathi, kunjalo.
I decided to stay alone.	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndibe ndedwa.
We both know why you are leaving.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni uhamba.
Any way to do this.	Nayiphi na indlela yokwenza oku.
This did not happen, however.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke, nangona kunjalo.
I want to tell you.	Ndifuna ukukuxelela .
My father, I said, was never there.	Utata, ngathi, akazange abe khona.
He is your friend.	Ngumhlobo wakho .
But last night.	Kodwa phezolo.
Well, we didn't do that.	Hayi ke asizange senze njalo.
Not himself.	Hayi naye ngokwakhe.
I know you feel that way.	Ndiyazi ukuba uziva njalo.
That would be unusual.	Oko bekuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
He was talking about that.	Wayethetha ngaloo nto.
He said something very nice.	Wathetha into entle kakhulu.
Too much time.	Ixesha elininzi kakhulu .
I want to know more about this.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngale nto.
She feels strange to him.	Uziva engaqhelekanga kuye.
I want you as much as you want me to.	Ndifuna wena kangangoko ufuna mna.
One walks alone.	Omnye uhamba yedwa.
But he always arrives late.	Kodwa uhlala efika emva kwexesha.
The way he spoke.	Indlela athethe ngayo .
And not for sure.	Kwaye hayi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Not for anyone, really.	Hayi ngaye nabani na, ngokwenene.
I never read about it.	Andizange ndifunde ngayo.
I sit right next to him.	Ndihlala kanye ecaleni kwakhe.
I wanted it to be something, too.	Ndandifuna ukuba yinto, nam.
He did not know what to fear.	Wayengazi ukuba woyika ntoni.
My mother, a little.	Umama wam, kancinci.
I'll have to think about that.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
This means you will be the first to have it.	Oku kuthetha ukuba uya kuba ngowokuqala ukuba nayo.
There is a story.	Kukho ibali.
He can't get out.	Akakwazi ukuphuma.
It's coming tomorrow morning.	Iza kusasa ekuseni.
I'm sure that's exactly it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiloo nto kanye.
In the morning he was gone.	Ekuseni wayengekho.
I can play.	Ndiyakwazi ukudlala.
Really go to him.	Ngenene uye kuye.
He is eating his dinner.	Utya isidlo sakhe sangokuhlwa.
He didn't want her to know he knew.	Wayengafuni ukuba azi ukuba uyazi.
I did the same thing today.	Ndenze into enye namhlanje.
This does not have to be.	Oku akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala naye.
He just did too much.	Wenza nje kakhulu.
However, that is the case with everyone.	Kodwa ke, kunjalo wonke umntu.
But you one day.	Kodwa wena ngenye imini.
And then you just go up to this.	Kwaye ke nje uye phezulu kule.
Soon the day will come.	Kungekudala iza kufika imini.
He doesn't know the answer now.	Akayazi impendulo ngoku.
I can't think of it right now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo ngoku.
Man, you know that.	Mntu, uyayazi loo nto.
He did not come.	Akazange afike.
But you don't want to do that.	Kodwa awufuni ukwenza loo nto.
I hope you did more.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenze ngakumbi.
I wish that.	Ndinqwenela ukuba .
Me, of course.	Mna, kunjalo.
He had to tell her what was coming.	Kwafuneka amxelele into ezayo.
Only you can be.	Nguwe ukuba unokuba.
He went very far.	Wahamba kakhulu.
A few hours, really.	Iiyure ezimbalwa, ngokwenene.
You may be telling the truth.	Usenokuba uthetha inyani.
He should know better, he really should.	Kufuneka azi ngcono, ngenene kufuneka.
I definitely forgot about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndilibele ngayo.
It was not fun.	Akuzange kube mnandi.
And maybe the police.	Kwaye mhlawumbi amapolisa.
There is a way, of course.	Kukho indlela, kunjalo.
To me.	Kum.
Right where he wants it.	Kanye apho ayifunayo.
If this is not possible.	Ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
Not out yet.	Akukho ngaphandle okwangoku.
He will not be able to get a job.	Akayi kukwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
You must have fallen asleep.	Umele ukuba uye walala.
I'm looking at you.	Ndijonge kuwe.
I know enough that I can do it.	Ndiyazi ngokwaneleyo ukuba ndingayenza.
Football is just that.	Ibhola yiloo nto kanye.
He also knows a lot.	Naye uyazi kakhulu.
That is exactly what he wants for all of us.	Yiloo nto kanye ayifunayo kuthi sonke.
He won't really talk.	Akayi kuthetha ngokwenene.
Finding this right is not possible.	Ukufumana oku kulungile akunakwenzeka.
Please tell her thank you for me.	Ndicela umxelele enkosi ngam.
The question is where and how.	Umbuzo kukuba phi kwaye njani.
No one is so clever.	Akukho mntu ukrelekrele ngolo hlobo.
Maybe he was scared.	Mhlawumbi wayesoyika.
He did not know why he had come to her.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni eze kuye.
The children went to school.	Abantwana baye esikolweni.
Not all.	Akunjalo bonke.
It's a very old thing.	Yinto endala endala.
His work alone has been very successful.	Umsebenzi wakhe wedwa uphumelele kakhulu.
He was not thinking very well.	Wayengacingi kakuhle.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke le nto.
That's a big deal for us.	Yinto enkulu leyo kuthi.
You have no idea how lucky you are !.	Awuyazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani!.
It should be really fun.	Kufuneka kube mnandi ngokwenene.
Slowly the work progressed.	Wahamba kancinci umsebenzi.
Yes, that makes it easier.	Ewe, oko kukwenza lula.
Lots of people there.	Abantu abaninzi apho.
Like, alone.	Njengokuba, yedwa.
A place where everyone knows your name.	Indawo apho wonke umntu uyazi igama lakho.
Not exactly at first.	Hayi ncam kuqala.
You know, walking together.	Uyazi, ukuhamba kunye.
To be in it.	Ukuze ube kuyo.
I don't remember anyone living there.	Andikhumbuli mntu uhlala apho.
Of course, there is way too much.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kukho indlela eninzi kakhulu.
So he thought about it further.	Ngoko wacinga ngayo ngakumbi.
Or maybe he just wanted to get hurt.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayefuna ukuba buhlungu.
I never heard of you.	Zange ndive ngawe.
Not bad, not at all.	Hayi kakubi, akunjalo kwaphela.
I'm not sure what this song is about.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni na ngale ngoma.
To talk about it, we have to go.	Ukuthetha ngayo, kufuneka sihambe.
That is not really the case.	Nto leyo ayisiyiyo ngokwenene.
However, it is not possible for everyone to do it.	Nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka ukuba wonke umntu ayenze.
He had to find another place.	Kwafuneka afune enye indawo.
Let me just tell you.	Makhe ndikuxelele nje.
There was no reason, but he did.	Kwakungekho sizathu, kodwa wenza.
Dad did, too.	Utata wenza njalo, naye.
The question lies here.	Umbuzo ulele apha.
Or next month.	Okanye kwinyanga ezayo.
Maybe they will.	Mhlawumbi baya kwenza njalo.
Not much more, but a little bit.	Hayi kakhulu ngakumbi, kodwa kancinci.
The years are very good.	Iminyaka kakuhle kakhulu.
You may be saying that.	Usenokuba uthetha loo nto.
He sat down with him and began to eat.	Wahlala phantsi naye waqalisa ukutya.
But that will not be easy.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba lula.
I forgot about you.	Ndilibele ngawe ke.
So, three people.	Ngoko, abantu abathathu.
Look at this place.	Jonga kule ndawo.
I've been to see.	Ndikhe ndaya kubona.
I know my mom wants me to stay with her.	Ndiyazi ukuba umama ufuna ndihlale naye.
That place.	Loo ndawo .
Well, that's the time, too.	Ewe, lixesha elo, kwakhona.
They always stay.	Bahlala bahlala.
He loves me the same way I do.	Uthanda ngendlela efanayo nam.
Now something very unusual happened.	Ngoku kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He always does.	Usoloko esenza.
Slowly, to tell you the truth.	Kancinci, ukukuxelela inyaniso.
But it was not you.	Kodwa akuzange kube nguwe.
Obviously I don't want to do this.	Ngokucacileyo andifuni kuyenza le nto.
But not so many others.	Kodwa hayi abanye kakhulu.
By the way too.	Ngendlela kakhulu.
You're just kidding.	Udlala ngawe nje.
He was talking about anything or nothing.	Wayethetha ngayo nantoni na okanye kwanto.
It is possible.	Kusenokwenzeka.
It will be very difficult for me.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu kum.
I'll try to find something else here.	Ndiza kuzama ukufumana enye into apha.
Only to him.	Kuphela kuye.
And then the police.	Kwaye emva koko amapolisa.
Yes, thank you for being with me.	Ewe, enkosi ngokuba nam.
Why?	Inokuba kutheni?.
The place will be the same.	Indawo iya kuba yinto efanayo.
And not just me, everyone.	Kwaye hayi mna kuphela, wonke umntu.
And he did not.	Kwaye akenzanga.
There is only this.	Kukho oku kuphela.
That's better.	Oko kungcono.
I hope one day you will come back.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ngenye imini uya kubuya.
It's really good.	Ilungile ngenene.
So, of course, you have to go.	Ngoko, ngokuqinisekileyo, kufuneka uhambe.
We want everyone to come inside.	Sifuna wonke umntu angene ngaphakathi.
Or our way.	Okanye indlela yethu.
Now you just did.	Ngoku wenze nje.
He talked about it every day.	Wayethetha ngayo yonke imihla.
But in this case, there was nothing.	Kodwa kule meko kwakungekho nto.
He saw the people behind him.	Wabona abantu emva kwakhe.
It’s a small thing, nothing really.	Yinto encinci, akukho nto ngokwenene.
We will be very visible.	Siza kubonakala kakhulu.
My mistake, really, or not.	Impazamo yam, ngokwenene, okanye hayi.
I just want to talk.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha.
And why now.	Kwaye kutheni ngoku.
He has to do well.	Kufuneka enze kakuhle.
But we had it there.	Kodwa sibe nayo apho.
There is no one behind him.	Akukho mntu emva kwakhe.
But I could not.	Kodwa andizange ndikwazi.
Money, especially.	Imali, ngakumbi.
Now he was out of town.	Ngoku wayengekho edolophini.
Or being angry.	Okanye ukuba nomsindo.
This is exactly it.	Nguye kanye lo.
You have to stay that way.	Kufuneka uhlale unjalo.
And then something happened.	Kwaye ke into eyenzekayo.
Not in it, in it.	Hayi kuyo, kuyo.
I can't wait to do these again.	Andikwazi kulinda ukwenza ezi kwakhona.
I can't tell which one.	Andikwazi ukuxelela ukuba yeyiphi.
He ran away, after a while.	Uye wabaleka, emva kwexesha.
I would really like to know more about you.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukwazi ngakumbi ngawe.
I didn't say anything else.	Khange ndithethe enye into.
And to go to it.	Kwaye ukuya kuyo.
They will stay at home.	Baza kuhlala ekhaya.
But maybe it's better this way.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
He will be a player.	Iya kuba ngumdlali.
And there are many deaths.	Kwaye kukho ukufa okuninzi.
But he was not in her.	Kodwa wayengekho kuye.
Let me make a call.	Makhe ndenze umnxeba.
I'd like to talk to you, please.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe nceda.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
He's not there, you know.	Akakho apho, uyazi.
So he did this on the ground.	Ngoko wenza le nto phantsi.
And my mother wasn't very home, either.	Kwaye umama wayengekho kakhulu ekhaya, naye.
It seems like a long time.	Kubonakala ngathi ixesha elide.
No one should be able to do that.	Akukho mntu ufanele akwazi ukwenza oko.
I enjoy doing work.	Ndiyavuya ukwenza umsebenzi.
He did not come to school today.	Akazange eze namhlanje esikolweni.
He opened the door, looked inside.	Wavula ucango, wajonga ngaphakathi.
He is tall enough.	Mde ngokwaneleyo.
He's going to have to do something about it.	Kuya kufuneka enze into ngaloo nto.
Not too early.	Hayi kwangethuba.
I didn't want to be her friend.	Ndandingafuni ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
But no one does such a thing.	Kodwa akukho mntu wenza into enjalo.
I came to speak here.	Ndize kuthetha apha.
You better stay home today.	Kungcono uhlale endlini namhlanje.
He sat down and thought.	Wahlala phantsi wacinga.
You felt the same way until you left.	Nawe waziva ngendlela efanayo de wemka.
Or we will return.	Okanye siya kubuya.
He was very talkative.	Wayethetha kakhulu.
The same thing happens all the time.	Kwenzeka into efanayo ngalo lonke ixesha.
He lives with me.	Uhlala nam.
You are right when you are right.	Ulungile xa ulungile.
You come first to this.	Uze kuqala kule nto.
You just have to stay there.	Kufuneka nje uhlale apho.
This can be difficult and time consuming.	Oku kunokuba nzima kwaye kuthatha ixesha.
He says he did.	Uthi wenza njalo.
We did not go to him.	Asizange siye kuye.
And then he came.	Kwaye ke weza.
We have to have time.	Sifanele sibe nexesha.
Well, well, very good.	Kulungile, kulungile, kuhle kakhulu.
Not much talking.	Akukho ukuthetha kakhulu.
Me and you then.	Mna nawe ke.
Not that this happened to me.	Hayi ukuba oku kwenzeka kum.
And so now.	Kwaye ngoko ke ngoku.
I doubt a little about that.	Ndiyathandabuza kancinci ngaloo nto.
You have entered a message.	Uye wangena umyalezo.
He got a test.	Wafumana uvavanyo.
I shouldn't have come, she thought.	Bekungafanelanga ndize, wacinga.
I don't care much.	Andikhathali kakhulu.
What happened next, he did not know.	Kwenzeka ntoni emva koko, wayengazi.
He just did his thing.	Wenza nje into yakhe.
It comes a little slower.	Iza kancinci kancinci.
I did not go to you.	Khange ndiye kuwe.
Lifetime.	Ubomi bonke.
They both go to college.	Bobabini baya ekholejini.
I have to do a few things.	Kufuneka ndenze izinto ezimbalwa.
So everyone.	Ngoko ke wonke umntu.
He will never speak.	Soze athethe.
Beautiful, very beautiful.	Mhle, mhle kakhulu.
I don't remember that.	Andikhumbuli loo nto.
I'm not beautiful at all.	Andikho mhle kwaphela.
He lay on his side.	Walala ecaleni.
There are people.	Apho kukho abantu.
You have to go all the way.	Kufuneka uhambe yonke indlela.
I don't like it at all.	Andiyithandi tu.
Yes, not for long.	Ewe, hayi ixesha elide.
Trying to do two things at once.	Ukuzama ukwenza izinto ezimbini ngexesha elinye.
My case.	Ityala lam.
It can be very painful.	Kunokuba buhlungu kakhulu.
That was nobody.	Oko kwakungekho mntu.
He could not help.	Akazange akwazi ukunceda.
Such a beautiful day.	Imini entle kangaka.
Please check this out and tell me what you think.	Nceda ujonge oku kwaye undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I can't die right now.	Andikwazi ukufa okwangoku.
Now everyone asked.	Ngoku wonke umntu wabuza.
Nice bike.	Ibhayisekile entle.
But stop sitting.	Kodwa yeka ukuhlala.
And not exactly.	Kwaye hayi kanye.
Right now, you definitely can't go home.	Okwangoku, ngokuqinisekileyo awukwazi ukuya ekhaya.
I made my decision.	Ndenza isigqibo sam.
And he began to succeed.	Kwaye waqalisa ukuphumelela.
We did not and will not.	Asizange kwaye asiyi.
I wanted to eat lunch.	Bendifuna ukutya isidlo sasemini.
I thought it would be even more fun like that.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba mnandi ngakumbi ngolo hlobo.
Well, if you like something like that.	Kulungile, ukuba uthanda into enjalo.
Not there.	Akukho apho.
Then, maybe it happened.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi kuye kwenzeka.
It's hard to talk about it now.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngayo ngoku.
Don't talk! 	Musa ukuthetha!
I came and talked to him.	Ndifike ndithethe naye.
Is there anyone else there.	Ngaba kukho omnye umntu apho.
Death out of here.	Ukufa ukuphuma apha.
You should know too.	Kufuneka uyazi nawe.
He meant everything to me.	Wayethetha yonke into kum.
He understood three things at that time.	Waqonda izinto ezintathu ngelo xesha.
All the time, and immediately.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, kwaye ngoko nangoko.
Really in everything here.	Ngokwenene kukho konke apha.
Maybe some flowers at a time.	Mhlawumbi ezinye iintyatyambo kanye ngexesha.
They will need dinner.	Baza kufuna isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Is something happening to me?	Ngaba kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
Yes, it can be challenging, and it can be very painful.	Ewe, kunokuba nzima, kwaye kunokuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
Or a new book.	Okanye incwadi entsha.
However, you can do it.	Nangona kunjalo, ungayenza.
It is difficult but where you are going.	Kunzima kodwa apho uya khona.
I can't drive.	Andikwazi ukuqhuba.
I asked to sit down.	Ndacela ukuhlala phantsi.
But there is this little bit.	Kodwa kukho oku kancinci.
It will make your job a lot easier.	Kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula kakhulu.
We want to improve.	Sifuna ukwenza ngcono.
I like that, though.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto, nangona kunjalo.
He really is.	Nguye ngokwenene .
He seems to be able to speak.	Kubonakala ngathi uyakwazi ukuthetha.
Better off without me.	Kungcono ngaphandle kwam.
That's why it speaks badly.	Yiyo loo nto ethetha kakubi.
He was not completely down.	Wayengekho phantsi ngokupheleleyo.
He did what he did because he did it.	Wenza into ayenzileyo ngenxa yokuba uyenzile.
Night and in bed.	Ubusuku kunye ebhedini.
So, you never knew.	Ngoko, awuzange wazi.
You do not always think.	Awucingi njalo.
And you told me everything.	Kwaye undixelele yonke into.
And maybe many more.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ezininzi ngakumbi.
This will mean quitting.	Oku kuya kuthetha ukuyeka.
We will go every day.	Siza kuhamba yonke imihla.
That would win everything.	Oko bekuya kuphumelela yonke into.
He seemed to think of her.	Wabonakala ngathi ucinga ngaye.
There are times here.	Kukho amaxesha apha.
Otherwise, it is not really necessary.	Ngaphandle koko, akuyomfuneko ngokwenene.
You have to tell me everything.	Kufuneka undixelele konke.
I don't believe you are serious.	Andikholelwa ukuba uzimisele.
And I'm not so sure.	Mna ke andiqinisekanga kakhulu.
Not until, well, too long.	Hayi de, ke, ixesha elide kakhulu.
And this is what happens.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka.
He just walked in.	Wangena nje wangena.
Yes, but not always.	Ewe, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
The wait was not long.	Ukulinda akuzange kube kudala.
He didn't know what was coming.	Wayengazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
I didn't want to tell you before.	Bendingafuni ukukuxelela ngaphambili.
I thought, maybe.	Ndacinga, mhlawumbi .
But getting there is always difficult.	Kodwa ukufika kuhlala kunzima.
And not just anyone.	Kwaye hayi nabani na.
Or you almost did.	Okanye uphantse wenza.
To be .	Ukuba .
Waiting here.	Ulinde apha.
And he is just like me.	Kwaye ufana nam.
But he was not.	Kodwa akazange abe njalo.
It makes walking alone.	Kwenza ukuhamba yedwa.
You feel like it’s not, not anything.	Uziva ngathi akunjalo, hayi nantoni na.
I just want to know what you think.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
My wife does not like this.	Umfazi wam akayithandi le nto.
Don't wait to sit down.	Musa ukulinda ukuhlala phantsi.
He died before that could happen.	Wafa ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke oko.
Will it be easy, no.	Ngaba kuya kuba lula, hayi.
Behind him is a large window.	Emva kwakhe kukho ifestile enkulu.
Now is our time.	Ngoku lixesha lethu.
But you think nothing.	Kodwa awucingi nto.
We did not go to the hospital.	Khange siye esibhedlele.
No one now.	Akukho namnye ngoku.
I will do some.	Ndiza kwenza ezinye.
He acted fast and confident.	Wenza ngokukhawuleza kwaye uqinisekile.
Some people find it difficult.	Abanye abantu kunzima.
Who do you want to be?	Ufuna ukuba ngubani.
He did not know that there were people in that area.	Wayengazi ukuba kukho abantu kuloo ndawo.
You should go with us immediately.	Kufuneka uhambe nathi kwangoko.
I'm just asking you.	Ndicela nje wena.
Because of him and you.	Ngenxa yakhe kunye nawe.
You think you know.	Ucinga ukuba uyazi.
Yes, it should.	Ewe, kufuneka kube njalo.
Then he realized that he was not alone.	Emva koko waqonda ukuba ayinguye yedwa.
And that happens all the time.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka rhoqo.
He wanted to do this all night.	Wayefuna ukwenza oku ubusuku bonke.
Did you realize that maybe not.	Ngaba waqonda ukuba mhlawumbi akunjalo.
You mean a lot to me.	Uthetha izinto ezininzi kum.
I don't remember anything about that.	Andikhumbuli nto ngalonto.
He went to his room.	Wahamba waya egumbini lakhe.
And it's good again.	Kwaye kuhle kwakhona.
You can be there all day and maybe for a long time.	Unokuba khona imini yonke kwaye mhlawumbi ixesha elide.
Thank you so much for everything.	Enkosi kakhulu ngayo yonke into.
I will do that.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto.
Is there a better way.	Ngaba kukho indlela engcono.
And he did not.	Kwaye naye akazange.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
It's such a beautiful thing in town !.	Yinto entle kangaka edolophini!.
He is sleeping well.	Ulele kakuhle.
We will be back today.	Siza kubuya namhlanje.
Will this ever happen?	Ngaba oku kuya kwenzeka?
So maybe not.	Ngoko mhlawumbi akunjalo.
That will happen next week.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kwiveki ezayo.
This may be true of you.	Oku kunokuba yinyani yakho.
This is your friend here.	Ngumhlobo wakho lo apha.
I will not do so now.	Andiyi kwenza njalo ngoku.
I didn't think of anything else at the time.	Andizange ndicinge ngenye into ngelo xesha.
I'm not sure how I did it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenza njani.
To tell your truth.	Ukuthetha inyaniso yakho.
Probably about everything.	Mhlawumbi malunga nayo yonke into.
He is completely absent.	Akakho ngokupheleleyo.
So it will be very fun.	Ngoko kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
No, just too many years.	Hayi, iminyaka nje emininzi kakhulu.
I did not want to do this.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza ke le nto.
He did a great job.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu.
The problem is, he does not know how.	Ingxaki kukuba, akazi ukuba njani.
Sorry, but you will have to go with me.	Uxolo, kodwa kuya kufuneka uhambe nam.
It happens almost all the time.	Kwenzeka phantse ngalo lonke ixesha.
Well, well, there you are.	Ke, kulungile, nantso ke.
He had never done this before.	Akazange enze ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
There you have to look.	Apho kufuneka ujonge.
You have a problem here.	Unengxaki apha.
But this is not very likely.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
I arrived first.	Ndifike kuqala.
Tomorrow morning.	Ngomso ngomso.
Even you.	Nokuba wena .
I just don't know why.	Andazi nje ukuba kutheni.
But it was made by a friend of mine.	Kodwa yenziwe ngumhlobo wam.
It will be more difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He asked to speak to me.	Wacela ukuthetha nam.
Is the phone OK? 	Ingaba ifowuni ilungile?
in case.	mhlawumbi.
But you know the whole thing.	Kodwa uyazi yonke loo nto.
At this point, everything or nothing.	Ngeli xesha, yonke into okanye akukho nto.
Obviously, that is not the case here.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akunjalo apha.
I think we did a really good job with that.	Ndicinga ukuba senze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
He did not know much about his work.	Wayengazi kakhulu ngomsebenzi wakhe.
In a good way that.	Ngendlela entle oko.
At first he did not speak.	Ekuqaleni akazange athethe.
And maybe not.	Kwaye mhlawumbi asiyi.
I hope it's okay to go.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile ukuhamba.
I want to get out on my own.	Ndifuna ukuphuma ngokwam.
Other than that, it looks good.	Ngaphandle koko, kubonakala kulungile.
He came down behind me.	Wehla emva kwam.
I told her.	Ndiye ndamxelela.
And he went away with him.	Wemka ke naye.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akufuneki kube njalo.
It's hard though.	Kunzima kodwa.
But, it is true.	Kodwa, yinyani.
Probably some of his friends.	Mhlawumbi abanye abahlobo bakhe.
So if you want.	Ngoko ukuba uyafuna.
All right, good for you.	Kulungile, kuhle kuwe.
But then you start.	Kodwa ke uya kuqala.
I know that should not be the case.	Ndiyazi ukuba akufanele kube njalo.
He took it slowly.	Wathatha kancinci kancinci.
But one day.	Kodwa ngenye imini.
Build that you need to.	Zakhe ukuba kufuneka.
He's just sitting with us.	Uhleli nje nathi.
It means everyone.	Kuthetha wonke umntu.
You talk to me a lot.	Uthetha nam kakhulu.
I doubt that.	Ndiyathandabuza ngaloo nto.
Unless he never left or anything.	Ngaphandle kokuba akazange ahambe okanye nantoni na.
I don't understand why exactly.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni kanye.
We certainly did not go that way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo asizange sihambe ngolu hlobo.
This is not entirely about me.	Oku akukho ngam ngokupheleleyo.
He wants you to know that.	Ufuna uyazi loo nto.
Living there.	Ukuhlala apho.
However, that is not the case at all.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo konke konke.
Almost everything is fine.	Phantse yonke into ilungile.
He slept all day.	Walala imini yonke.
He went ahead.	Wahamba phambili.
The gun also died.	Umpu naye wafa.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
He wanted nothing there.	Wayengafuni nto apho.
You know why you are reading this.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni ufunda le nto.
I can't imagine why.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni.
Everyone loves a little attention.	Wonke umntu uthanda ingqalelo encinci.
Not much is happening outside.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo ngaphandle.
In this case, he did.	Kule meko, uyenzile.
I can control myself and whatever happens.	Ndiyakwazi ukuzibamba kunye nantoni na eyenzekayo.
That's our way there.	Nantso indlela yethu phaya.
Then he heard loudly.	Emva koko weva phezulu.
Now you want to make it happen.	Ngoku ufuna ukuyenza yenzeke.
He ate and went back to his room.	Watya wabuyela egumbini lakhe.
He stays two hours.	Uhlala iiyure ezimbini.
I'm very sorry about this.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngale nto.
You just have to know.	Kufuneka ukwazi kuphela.
My mother too.	Umama naye.
An error should not occur then.	Impazamo akufunekanga yenzeke ngoko.
That is not all.	Akunjalo yonke loo nto.
Not only here but all day.	Hayi apha kuphela kodwa yonke imini.
You read really hard.	Ufunda nzima ngokwenene.
Is true .	Yinyani .
No, no and no.	Hayi, hayi kwaye hayi.
He is sitting in his office tonight.	Uhleli eofisini yakhe ngokuhlwanje.
He has gone too far.	Uye wahamba kakhulu.
Therefore, we need another way.	Ngoko ke, kufuneka enye indlela.
I have never heard anything before.	Andizange ndive nantoni na ngaphambili.
After that, he never tried again.	Emva koko, akazange aphinde azame.
He did not think so.	Akazange acinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
You are here one day, there is another.	Ulapha ngenye imini, kukho enye.
He knew he was human.	Wayesazi ukuba ungumntu.
I think that's all.	Ndicinga ukuba konke.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
Maybe he will come to you.	Mhlawumbi uya kuza kuwe.
Or in this case, he did not.	Okanye kule meko, akazange.
Nowhere and everywhere.	Akukho ndawo kwaye yonke indawo.
And we will be with you all the time.	Kwaye siya kuba nawe lonke ixesha.
He did not say much about all the work.	Khange athethe kakhulu wonke umsebenzi.
That's what everybody says.	Yiloo nto ethethwa ngumntu wonke.
I saw my dad recently.	Ndibone utata mva nje.
No money now.	Akukho mali ngoku.
Now, please.	Ngoku, nceda.
They both say no.	Bobabini bathi hayi.
Now you know that your dad can do that.	Ngoku uyazi ukuba utata wakho angayenza loo nto.
There is no book here.	Akukho ncwadi apha.
Daily reading.	Ukufunda yonke imihla.
It seemed necessary.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kufuneka.
You don't have to say it's okay.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthi kulungile.
But he did not want to help.	Kodwa akazange afune ukunceda.
I should have known by now.	Bekufanele ukuba ndiyazi ngoku.
Almost everywhere.	Phantse kuyo yonke indawo.
They are everywhere for us.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo ngathi.
He said he could be.	Wathi unokuba.
But, you may be.	Kodwa, usenokuba.
I'm not sure either.	Nam andiqinisekanga.
Why are you here ?.	Kutheni ulapha nje?.
Not so with you.	Akunjalo nawe.
Or three weeks.	Okanye iiveki ezintathu.
Food and anything.	Ukutya kunye nantoni na.
I apologize for it.	Ndicela uxolo ngayo.
Now he just seemed tired.	Ngoku wayebonakala nje ukuba udiniwe.
I never did this.	Andizange ndiyenze le nto.
See how to do it.	Jonga indlela yokwenza.
Obviously not here.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
Thanks in advance.	Enkosi phambili.
Obviously, though, there is a problem.	Ngokucacileyo, nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki.
He built more.	Wakha ngakumbi.
If he only knew what it was.	Ukuba nje wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
You must know about it.	Umele ukuba uyazi ngayo.
I think you need time.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ixesha.
I'm just asking one thing from you.	Ndicela nje into enye kuwe.
I can't do it again.	Andikwazi ukuyenza kwakhona.
Who, why, how.	Ngubani, kutheni, njani.
We will do this together.	Siza kuyenza kunye oku.
It will come here.	Iza kufika apha.
He says he will be back.	Uthi uza kubuya.
And now we know why.	Kwaye ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
And he knew everything about it.	Kwaye wayesazi yonke into ngayo.
Or my dog.	Okanye inja yam.
He did it all night.	Wayenza ubusuku bonke.
Bad mistake.	Impazamo embi.
We did our thing.	Senze into yethu.
He got everything wrong.	Wafumana yonke into engalunganga.
There was no one and there was nothing.	Kwakungekho mntu kwaye kwakungekho nto.
They just exist if possible.	Bakho nje ukuba kunokwenzeka.
You will be with him again.	Uza kuba naye kwakhona.
I can't see inside.	Andiboni ngaphakathi.
I will need help here.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo apha.
You just watch and wait.	Wena jonga nje kwaye ulinde .
I mean really big money.	Ndithetha imali enkulu ngokwenene.
Now she is scared.	Ngoku uyoyika.
Stop others.	Yeka abanye.
Then, however, they will come after you.	Emva koko, nangona kunjalo, baya kuza emva kwakho.
Maybe we made a mistake in this case.	Mhlawumbi senze impazamo kule meko.
Image alone.	Umfanekiso wedwa.
And maybe that would be a good idea.	Kwaye mhlawumbi oko bekuya kuba licebo elihle.
It was too early.	Kwangethuba kakhulu.
You talked about him.	Uthethe ngaye.
Eventually, he became angry.	Ekugqibeleni, waba nomsindo.
This will take a lot of time.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
It’s just everyday.	Yinto nje yonke imihla.
Yes you are right.	Ewe, ulungile.
You have your truth, too.	Unayo inyaniso yakho, nawe.
It really does a very good job.	Ngenene wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
We will take another question.	Siza kuthatha omnye umbuzo.
There you look right.	Kukho ubonakala ulungile.
At first, he was really angry.	Ekuqaleni, waba nomsindo ngokwenene.
Nothing but time.	Akukho nto ngaphandle kwexesha.
I asked for help with it.	Ndacela uncedo kuyo.
Something very unusual.	Enye into engaqhelekanga.
I can't think of all this right now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngayo yonke le nto ngoku.
He is coming now.	Uza kuza ngoku.
He thought a lot on his own.	Ucinge okuninzi eyedwa.
You just have to know how.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukuba njani.
But not as much as possible.	Kodwa hayi kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
I'm tired, but it's definitely okay.	Ndidiniwe, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kulungile.
It was not easy for him.	Akuzange kube lula kuye.
I wonder who it might be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba ngubani.
No one says no to him.	Akukho mntu uthi hayi kuye.
I told him in the morning.	Ndimxelele kusasa.
Once, then again.	Kanye, ngoko kwakhona.
He will do so.	Uya kwenza njalo.
I did not want to give up.	Ndandingafuni ukuyeka.
It was as if he were trying to read my mind.	Ngathi uzama ukufunda ingqondo yam.
And the bus.	Kwaye ibhasi.
We need to do this in the end.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto ekugqibeleni.
And soon another.	Kwaye kungekudala enye.
I just want to know how it happened.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
I can't talk about this book.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngale ncwadi.
That is clear to me.	Oko kucacile kum.
Any large meat.	Nayiphi na inyama enkulu.
I will sit next to you.	Ndiya kuhlala ecaleni kwakho.
And there is no need for that.	Kwaye akukho mfuneko yokuba.
Or buy a car.	Okanye ukuthenga imoto.
I will not have to do it alone.	Akuyi kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa.
But he can't do it.	Kodwa akakwazi ukwenza.
Ready to speak.	Ukulungele ukuthetha.
That can be a good thing or a bad thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle okanye embi.
He took one up.	Wathatha enye phezulu.
As we shall see, this is certainly true.	Njengoko siza kubona, oku kunjalo ngokwenene.
Give me some coffee.	Ndinike ikofu.
Even if he doesn't want to do it.	Nokuba akafuni kuyenza.
No matter what happens to you or what you do.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe okanye wenze ntoni na.
We'll see if that really happens or not, though.	Siza kubona ukuba oko kwenzeka ngokwenene okanye akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
But you have to look at the person first.	Kodwa kufuneka ujonge umntu kuqala.
Now that way.	Ngoku ngaloo ndlela.
He will do so.	Uza kwenza njalo.
He lived for a long time.	Wayehlala ixesha elide.
Maybe you can't speak.	Mhlawumbi awukwazi ukuthetha.
It should be soon.	Kumele kube kungekudala.
It's really bad to live with it.	Yinto embi ngokwenene ukuhlala nayo.
I do not want to talk.	Andifuni kuthetha.
No, that will take a very long time.	Hayi, oko kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
He did not want to talk about this.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngale nto.
Not yet, and probably never will.	Hayi okwangoku, kwaye mhlawumbi soze.
And my anger.	Nomsindo wam.
And that doesn't have to be.	Kwaye oko akunyanzelekanga.
Something very new for him.	Into entsha kakhulu kuye.
And he wants his life.	Kwaye ufuna ubomi bakhe.
We just know for sure.	Siyazi nje ngokucacileyo.
He fell asleep the night before he did.	Walala ebusuku ngaphambi kokuba enze.
But he thought so.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba kunjalo.
Well that's fine.	Kulungile ukuba kunjalo.
He will be here soon.	Uza kuba apha kungekudala.
Just a little trying.	Ukuzama nje kancinci.
Or going forward.	Okanye ukuya phambili.
We will start at the end, not the beginning.	Siza kuqala ekugqibeleni, hayi ekuqaleni.
That's the truth.	Nantso inyaniso.
Driving requires constant attention.	Ukuqhuba kufuna ingqalelo rhoqo.
You want to do something completely new.	Ufuna ukwenza into entsha ngokupheleleyo.
To me, everything is fine.	Kum, yonke into ilungile.
You want to know, now you know.	Ufuna ukwazi, ngoku uyazi.
He is much smarter than I am.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu kunam.
But not time.	Kodwa hayi ixesha.
Only a few hours.	Iiyure ezimbalwa kuphela.
So this should not be the case.	Ngoko oku akufanele kube yinto.
If we want the truth.	Ukuba sifuna inyaniso.
And someone will speak.	Kwaye umntu uya kuthetha.
You know, finally.	Uyazi, ekugqibeleni.
That will require a book.	Oko kuya kufuna incwadi.
This is a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu le kum.
I don't have to think about it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ndicinge ngayo.
There is no one but you.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle kwakho.
I did not want to go there.	Ndandingafuni ukuya apho.
I learned about you.	Ndifunde ngawe.
I need to talk to you about something else.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe ngenye into.
That's all he wants now.	Nantso kuphela into ayifunayo ngoku.
He should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba wayesazi ngcono.
I can't do anything with him.	Andikwazi kwenza nto naye.
He likes to do that.	Uyathanda ukwenza loo nto.
I don't care so much.	Andikhathali kangako.
And that's pretty good to know.	Kwaye oko kuhle kakhulu ukwazi.
Well, it's the same thing.	Ewe, yinto enye.
That will really hurt.	Oko kuya kuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
Truth, that's all.	Inyaniso, yiyo yonke loo nto.
Now she is happy that she never did.	Ngoku uyavuya kuba engazange enjenjalo.
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi ngcono.
You just have to wait.	Kufuneka ulinde nje.
It's okay to go slow.	Kulungile ukuba uhamba kancinci.
Yes, I, too.	Ewe, nam, nam.
It owes a lot.	Ityala kakhulu.
But one more thing, too.	Kodwa enye into, nayo.
He's out here trying.	Ulapha phandle uzama.
He will do it with this.	Uya kuyenza ngale nto.
Probably for him, of course.	Mhlawumbi kuye, kunjalo.
No one knew before.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngaphambili.
And no one did anything.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza nto.
Take a good look at the office perhaps.	Jonga kakuhle eofisini mhlawumbi.
Then this was not about him, he realized.	Emva koko oku kwakungekho malunga naye, waqonda.
Yes Yes.	Ewe, ewe.
And you just know it.	Kwaye uyazi nje.
You can't go to it.	Awukwazi ukuya kuyo.
And again, and again, and again.	Kwaye kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona.
As you know, man.	Njengoko uyazi, umntu.
It’s good and it’s good.	Ilungile kwaye ilungile.
At that moment he did something very strange.	Ngelo xesha wenza into engaqhelekanga.
Everyone is a little scared at first.	Wonke umntu uyoyika kancinci ekuqaleni.
Not really long.	Hayi ixesha elide ngokwenene.
Everyone came to me.	Wonke umntu weza kum.
Or maybe two or three.	Okanye mhlawumbi ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
The hat went to him.	Umnqwazi uye kuye.
But not here and not now.	Kodwa hayi apha kwaye hayi ngoku.
The reason we are here.	Isizathu sokuba sibe lapha.
He made a lot of money.	Wenza imali eninzi kakhulu.
Clearly and not a bit.	Ngokucacileyo kwaye hayi kancinci.
I could not go that far.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuya kude kangako.
So he did that in his own time.	Ngoko wakwenza oko ngexesha lakhe.
It's a long time, though.	Lixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
He never told her he loved her.	Akazange amxelele ukuba uyamthanda.
Everyone was afraid of something.	Wonke umntu wayesoyika into ethile.
Then it all happened yesterday.	Emva koko konke kuba izolo.
Someone made a mistake.	Umntu wenza impazamo.
I think that's something to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto yokwenza.
All the time and so on.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kwaye ngoko.
Or just another one.	Okanye nje enye.
I would love to learn how to do that.	Ndingathanda ukufunda indlela yokwenza oko.
Not bad, really.	Hayi embi, ngokwenene.
As you know now, it is not.	Njengoko uyazi ngoku, akunjalo.
It's his, our thing.	Yinto yakhe, into yethu.
He would talk to her, again, and try.	Wayeza kuthetha naye, kwakhona, azame.
And then, okay.	Kwaye ke, kulungile.
I look forward to this week.	Ndijonge phambili kule veki.
Your life, our work.	Ubomi bakho, umsebenzi wethu.
He did not think it was necessary.	Wayengacingi ukuba kufuneka.
However, it is fine.	Nangona kunjalo, ilungile.
I've always been here.	Bendisoloko ndilapha.
And it is always good.	Kwaye kuhle njalo.
But you have to make a decision.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
It is not a toy.	Asiyonto yokudlala.
He too began to walk.	Naye waqalisa ukuhamba.
It's hard to work.	Kunzima ukusebenza.
One whole week.	Iveki enye yonke.
My mother had to drive for hours.	Umama kwafuneka aqhube iiyure ezininzi.
I think you did a very bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into embi kakhulu.
He has been there before.	Ukhe waba khona ngaphambili.
Getting out is not easy.	Ukuphuma akukho lula.
Again, and again and again.	Kwakhona, kwaye kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
This happened tonight.	Oku kwenzeke ngokuhlwanje.
He came with me.	Weza nam.
No waiting.	Akukho kulinda.
However, this seems very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
Too long, of course.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, kunjalo.
But almost everyone is like that.	Kodwa phantse wonke umntu unjalo.
And we will get better at it.	Kwaye siya kuba ngcono kuyo.
And some there, well, they didn't.	Kwaye abanye apho, ke, abazange.
Too late.	Emva kwexesha kakhulu.
That would be the same thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enye.
Having time.	Ukuba nexesha.
I have come this far.	Ndifike le kude.
It is better that he does not know.	Kungcono ukuba akazi.
I think that's just right.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo nje.
He knows he never really learned.	Uyazi ukuba akazange afunde ngokwenene.
You arrived so hard in the morning.	Ufike kunzima kangaka ekuseni.
I do anything.	Ndenza nantoni na.
It's the same thing, but whatever.	Yinto enye kanye, kodwa nokuba yintoni na.
I always want to succeed.	Ndihlala ndifuna ukuphumelela.
He will come to me then.	Uza kuza kum ngoko.
And you will have to go faster than you think.	Kwaye kuya kufuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza kunokuba ucinga.
Certainly not about everything that is happening now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngayo yonke into eyenzekayo ngoku.
In the same way you did.	Ngendlela efanayo wenze.
Nothing up.	Akukho nto phezulu.
I could not get out of this.	Andikwazanga ukuphuma kule nto.
And nothing happened.	Kwaye akuzange kwenzeke nto.
All day long he knew nothing but her.	Imini yonke wayengazi nto ngaphandle kwakhe.
They said yes.	Baye bathi ewe.
He is, all right.	Nguye, kulungile.
So he certainly thought about it.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo wayecinga ngayo.
He looked back.	Wajonga emva.
You will have to go.	Kuya kufuneka ukuhamba.
And the night.	Kwaye ubusuku.
I can't do something like this.	Andikwazi ukwenza into enje.
He wanted it to happen.	Wayefuna ukuba kwenzeke.
This may be more difficult than you realize.	Oku kunokuba nzima kunokuba ulindele.
I would, he thought.	Ndingathanda, wacinga.
Maybe you arrived late or, just in time.	Mhlawumbi wafika emva kwexesha okanye, kwangethuba.
He seemed to want the same thing.	Kwakubonakala ukuba wayefuna into efanayo.
I am sure everything will go well.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yonke into iya kuhamba kakuhle.
He didn't think of any of that.	Akazange acinge ngayo nayiphi na loo nto.
Up here.	Phezulu apha.
And it will have to.	Kwaye kuya kufuneka.
I finally decided to go.	Ekugqibeleni ndagqiba kwelokuba ndiye.
He heard everything.	Weva yonke into.
Definitely one for you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo enye kuwe.
Let me tell you one.	Makhe ndixelele enye.
Well, it seems that he was not alone.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi yayingenguye yedwa.
Now, look at me.	Ngoku, ndijonge.
He goes the way.	Uhamba ngendlela.
Really, right there.	Ngokwenene, kanye apho.
Yes, someone will succeed.	Ewe, kukho umntu oza kuphumelela.
Looks like I don't remember, well, anything really.	Kubonakala ngathi andikhumbuli, kulungile, nantoni na ngokwenene.
I don't see why.	Andiboni sizathu sokuba kutheni.
He would pretend to be interested.	Wayeza kwenza ngathi unomdla.
Doing the right thing is difficult.	Ukwenza into entle ngayo kunzima.
And there is someone who needs help.	Kwaye kukho umntu ofuna uncedo.
I look down again.	Ndiphinde ndijonge phantsi.
But so is it for now.	Kodwa kunjalo okwangoku.
You can do it in two places.	Ungayenza kwindawo ezimbini.
We are moving forward.	Siya phambili.
The question here, too, is why.	Umbuzo apha, kwakhona, kutheni.
I had to think of something.	Kwafuneka ndicinge into.
I know just a little bit.	Ndiyazi nje kancinci.
He stayed with me all day.	Wahlala nam imini yonke.
I would like him to do something.	Ndingathanda ukuba ayenze nto.
Just getting two.	Ukufumana nje ezimbini.
You will stay inside your car all the time.	Uya kuhlala ngaphakathi emotweni yakho lonke ixesha.
Or he may have hoped that it would.	Okanye wayenethemba lokuba kunjalo.
I think it's good for me.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile kum.
I do not know .	Andazi .
He's here again.	Ufike kwakhona.
Some find it difficult to get any answer at all.	Abanye kunzima ukufumana nayiphi na impendulo konke konke.
I know you're out here.	Ndiyazi ukuba ulapha phandle.
I like it all.	Ndiyayithanda yonke.
Alone.	Wedwa.
Then there is the purchase.	Emva koko kukho ukuthenga.
My mother knows.	Umama wam uyazi.
At the moment he wanted nothing.	Okwangoku wayengafuni kwanto.
I can't believe you came here alone.	Andikholelwa ukuba uze wedwa apha.
Yeah, what to do.	Ewe, ukwenza ntoni.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi kuya ndawo.
Finding food.	Ukufumana ukutya.
A little at a time.	Kancinci ngexesha.
No one really said anything.	Akukho mntu wathetha nto ngokwenene.
I did not know why.	Bendingazi ukuba kutheni.
Of course, that is not always the case.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo rhoqo.
If you want to go that far.	Ukuba ufuna ukuya kude kangaka.
There is music though.	Kukho umculo kunjalo.
He asked his mother.	Wabuza umama wakhe.
Thanks again everyone.	Enkosi kwakhona wonke umntu.
Nobody ever talks about it.	Akukho mntu ukhe athethe ngayo.
You must be very scared.	Ufanele ukuba woyika kakhulu.
But he was thinking of her completely.	Kodwa wayecinga ngaye ngokupheleleyo.
There is no continuity.	Akukho kuqhubeka.
He can't do this.	Akakwazi ukuyenza le nto.
I'm trying to learn about.	Ndizama ukufunda ngantoni.
But, then again, maybe so.	Kodwa, ngoko kwakhona, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Everyone will be better.	Wonke umntu uya kuba ngcono.
He’s doing very well, though.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
He built another.	Wakha enye.
So, at first.	Ngoko, ekuqaleni.
I do everything wrong.	Ndenza yonke into engalunganga.
Maybe there was nothing out there.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho nto ngaphandle.
Like, a long time.	Njengokuba, ixesha elide.
He wants to do it alone.	Ufuna ukuyenza yedwa.
He told me everything about it.	Undixelele yonke into ngayo.
But there is more here.	Kodwa kukho okuninzi ngakumbi apha.
I just love it completely.	Ndiyayithanda nje ngokupheleleyo.
What a car.	Yintoni imoto.
Something very great happened.	Kwenzeka into enkulu.
It will not be fun.	Akuyi kuba mnandi.
Unusual house.	Indlu engaqhelekanga.
I thought you would like to go with me.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda ukuhamba nam.
Then we have to make a decision.	Emva koko sifanele senze isigqibo.
Is his name.	Ngaba igama lakhe.
I'm afraid you're going with me now.	Ndiyoyika ukuba uhambe nam ngoku.
He certainly said yes.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uthe ewe.
That's why he came.	Yiyo loo nto eze.
We have gone too far.	Sele sihambe kakhulu.
So he had to go.	Ngoko kwafuneka ahambe.
A woman can never be real.	Umfazi akanakuze abe nguye ngokwenene.
No, no, but it hurts.	Hayi, hayi, kodwa buhlungu.
It will take time.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha.
He knew everything now.	Wayesazi yonke into ngoku.
And then, it wasn't.	Kwaye ke, kwakungekho.
Going to the house.	Ukuya endlwini.
Nothing about you.	Akukho nto ngawe.
I just want to know as soon as possible.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ngokukhawuleza.
Now he did.	Ngoku wenza njalo.
Although it should be very difficult to be a doctor.	Nangona kufuneka kube nzima kakhulu ukuba ngugqirha.
He did not want her to be beautiful.	Wayengafuni ukuba mhle kuye.
Better yet.	Kungcono kube kuhle.
But only me.	Kodwa mna kuphela.
all day long.	imini yonke.
He too began to sing.	Naye waqalisa ukucula.
We really did.	Senze ngokwenene.
He rarely speaks here.	Akafane athethe apha.
None.	Akukho .
Except maybe not so much.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.
Everyone better go.	Wonke umntu kungcono ahambe.
I made a big mistake.	Ndenze impazamo enkulu.
I just think this is good !.	Ndicinga nje ukuba oku kulungile!.
Yes, it is true, yes.	Ewe, yinyani, ewe.
And there is none.	Kwaye akukho .
For there.	Ngokuba khona.
You may be right about money.	Inokuba ulungile ngemali.
Well done.	Kulungile ukuba wenze .
Nobody still loves you.	Akukho mntu uthanda wena nangoku.
Then he became really angry.	Emva koko waba nomsindo ngokwenene.
I'm sure, of that.	Ndiqinisekile, ngaloo nto.
Of course he knew about it long ago.	Ewe wayesazi ngayo kudala.
What happened to me.	Kwenzeka ntoni kum.
And it was not necessary.	Kwaye kwakungeyomfuneko.
Well, you're in trouble right now.	Ewe, wenza ingxaki ngoku.
He knew he would never get to town.	Wayesazi ukuba akanakuze afike edolophini.
I don't need to talk to you.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe nawe.
His gun went off.	Umpu wakhe wemka.
Or maybe make peace with it.	Okanye mhlawumbi wenze uxolo nayo.
I better talk to her.	Ngcono ndithethe naye.
You're fine for now.	Ulungile okwangoku.
This is really great !.	Oku ngokwenene kuhle kakhulu!.
You have to stay with you.	Kufuneka uhlale nawe.
But, not at this time.	Kodwa, hayi ngeli xesha.
Yeah, not again.	Ewe, hayi kwakhona.
Large window.	Ifestile enkulu.
I have to stay away.	Kufuneka ndihlale kude.
Now we want someone new.	Ngoku sifuna umntu omtsha.
He didn't know he was here.	Wayengazi ukuba ulapha.
I wanted to talk to everyone about anything.	Ndandifuna ukuthetha naye wonke umntu ngayo nantoni na.
She loves it now.	Uyathanda ngoku.
Look at the girl.	Jonga intombi.
My mother thinks she is.	Umama ucinga ukuba nguye.
I hope you feel better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva engcono.
So not at all.	Ngoko akukho konke konke.
Then this happened.	Emva koko oku kwenzeka.
But you have to say my name.	Kodwa kufuneka uthethe igama lam.
You must not come to me.	Akufunekanga uze kum.
He could not get there.	Akazange akwazi ukuya apho.
He decided to do just that.	Wagqiba ekubeni enjenjalo.
Here is the book.	Nantso ke le ncwadi.
You are lucky for him, you are lucky for him.	Unethamsanqa kuye, unethamsanqa kuye.
Obviously it will be difficult to read.	Ngokucacileyo kuya kuba nzima ukufunda.
You want to go fast.	Ufuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
It's hard to stay here.	Kunzima ukuhlala apha.
I mean look really.	Ndithetha jonga ngokwenene.
And maybe you just want a job.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ufuna nje umsebenzi.
He should not do it.	Akufunekanga ayenze.
That’s it, isn’t it ?.	Yinto leyo, akunjalo?.
True though.	Yinyani nangona kunjalo.
But I think there is a problem.	Kodwa ndicinga ukuba kukho ingxaki.
You like something out there.	Uthanda into elapha phandle.
We want more than that.	Sifuna ngaphezu koko.
His talk will be interesting.	Intetho yakhe iya kuba mnandi.
Maybe you like it.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda.
He looks like he can play.	Ukhangeleka ngathi uyakwazi ukudlala.
Well, we don't.	Kulungile, asiyi.
And not just his house.	Kwaye hayi indlu yakhe kuphela.
Himself alone.	Ngokwakhe yedwa.
Almost three hours.	Phantse iiyure ezintathu.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Mhlawumbi akafuni.
Yes, but not entirely.	Ewe, kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
He thought he knew what was coming.	Wayecinga ukuba uyayazi into ezayo.
I think you are very interested.	Ndicinga ukuba unomdla kakhulu.
And he never could.	Kwaye akazange akwazi.
Not small and not big.	Hayi encinci kwaye hayi enkulu.
I can do it quickly on my own.	Ndingayenza ngokukhawuleza ndedwa.
I'm scared, too.	Ndiyoyika, nam.
There’s not much to do though.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza nangona kunjalo.
Just, really good.	Nje, kulungile ngokwenene.
They will, however.	Baza, nangona kunjalo.
Good enough.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
He can't say what he wants.	Akakwazi ukuthetha into ayifunayo.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, nayo leyo.
Then you will do it.	Emva koko uya kuyenza.
We have to do that.	Sifanele siyenze loo nto.
Because he is.	Kuba nguye.
He would take his time.	Wayeza kuthatha ixesha lakhe.
And you have to stay there.	Kwaye kufuneka uhlale apho.
And he wanted to do it.	Kwaye wayefuna ukwenza njalo.
But he can't do that.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Stop thinking too far into this.	Yeka ukucinga kude kakhulu kule nto.
He didn't look like anything at all.	Wayengabonakali ngathi yinto konke konke.
Everyone knows this about me.	Wonke umntu uyayazi le nto ngam.
There is a new one.	Kukho enye entsha.
Or you may not have to.	Okanye akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
My father was not there.	Utata wayengekho.
I speak very well.	Ndithetha kakuhle kakhulu.
I suspect it will always be that way.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
Again, give me time.	Kwakhona, ndinike ixesha.
It will be great for all of us.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu kuthi sonke.
We will stay with that.	Siza kuhlala naloo nto.
Everything that happens, will happen.	Yonke into eyenzekayo, iya kwenzeka.
Someone spoke to me.	Umntu uthethe nam.
It will be easier to talk to him.	Kuya kuba lula ukuthetha naye.
There is always something coming up to do.	Kuhlala kukho into ezayo yokwenza.
There in bed.	Phaya ebhedini.
But he did not say anything about what happened.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto ngaloo nto yenzekileyo.
He is my doctor.	Ngugqirha wam.
I can't talk about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
And it is not difficult.	Kwaye akukho nzima.
Well then maybe for now.	Kulungile ke mhlawumbi okwangoku.
Even if you don't want to.	Nokuba awufuni.
He talked to her, not to her.	Wathetha naye, hayi kuye.
A good wife is hard to find.	Umfazi olungileyo kunzima ukufumana.
And everyone knows that.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
Like, they didn't go.	Njengoko, abazange baye.
So the woman was not at home.	Ngoko umfazi wayengekho ekhaya.
Suddenly, it wasn’t.	Ngokukhawuleza, kwakungekho.
But we never went there.	Kodwa asizange siye apho.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange eze.
Could it be.	Ngaba inokuba njalo.
But you probably won't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi awuyi kukwazi.
And no, it wasn't.	Kwaye hayi, kwakungekho.
You will not be able to stay long.	Awuyi kukwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
And that can happen in the office.	Kwaye oko kunokwenzeka eofisini.
After all, he doesn’t want to.	Emva koko, akafuni.
Or a little later.	Okanye kamva kancinci.
And you will be the first to speak.	Kwaye uya kuba ngowokuqala ukuthetha.
He did not want anyone but himself.	Akazange afune nabani na ngaphandle kwakhe.
How can I do this ?.	Ndingayenza njani lento?.
And he did not read well.	Kwaye akazange afunde kakuhle.
That's your thing.	Nantso ke into yakho.
I would like to do that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko.
But still not as high as he wanted.	Kodwa nangoku hayi phezulu njengoko wayefuna.
And suddenly you know that.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza uyazi ukuba.
Playground.	Indawo yokudlala.
I can talk and talk about it.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha kwaye ndithethe malunga naloo nto.
But he thought that he would probably do well.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi uya kwenza kakuhle.
Then he sat down again.	Emva koko wahlala kwakhona.
She ran to him, not to him.	Wabaleka waya kuye, hayi kuye.
We deserve to be here.	Sifanele ukuba lapha.
And he obviously wanted something.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo wayefuna into.
But it will be difficult, too.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima, kwakhona.
In one way, there are two.	Ngendlela enye, kukho ezimbini.
Thank you for doing it.	Enkosi kuba uyenzile.
You had to do that.	Kwafuneka wenze njalo.
Just at this time.	Kanye ngeli xesha nje.
But, of course, it is not really so.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Her son is not in his bed.	Unyana wakhe akakho ebhedini yakhe.
This can be a little difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kancinci.
One thing or another.	Into okanye enye into.
He decided he didn't.	Wagqiba kwelokuba akenzanga.
One to help others.	Omnye ukunceda abanye.
But yes, for sure.	Kodwa ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Just a little bit, though.	Kancinci nje, nangona kunjalo.
He asked why.	Wabuza ukuba kutheni.
Now you need a test.	Ngoku ufuna uvavanyo.
I think, not all that much.	Ndiyacinga, hayi yonke into eninzi.
She is interested in him.	Unomdla kuye.
He would be in pain later.	Wayeza kuba buhlungu kamva.
Yes, but it is good.	Ewe, kodwa ilungile.
However, now it was clear.	Nangona kunjalo, ngoku kwakucacile.
I've always wanted to go there.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukuya khona.
Everyone works to the best of their ability.	Wonke umntu usebenza ngamandla akhe.
You know, it's weird.	Uyazi, into engaqhelekanga.
And not just a little, but a lot.	Kwaye hayi nje kancinci, kodwa kakhulu.
I think you have gone further.	Ndicinga ukuba uye phambili.
My father came out.	Utata waphuma wonke.
Everyone to me.	Wonke umntu kum.
He got into bed with me.	Wangena ebhedini nam.
No, I did not.	Hayi, andizange.
Or not, of course.	Okanye akunjalo, kunjalo.
I came to it myself.	Ndize kuyo ngokwam.
Not unless you go.	Akunjalo ngaphandle kokuba uye .
To you, it will seem so.	Kuwe, kuya kubonakala kunjalo.
You are coming with me tomorrow.	Uza nam ngomso.
He just thought.	Wacinga nje .
I had to do the same.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze loo nto nam.
We will take our chance.	Siza kuthatha ithuba lethu.
And you will get a job.	Kwaye uya kufumana umsebenzi.
It will be fine thank you.	Kuya kuba kuhle enkosi.
So do we.	Ngoko ke nathi.
Great job.	Umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
But then he thought.	Kodwa emva koko wacinga.
You have never been my friend.	Awuzange ube ngumhlobo wam.
You are trying to replace it.	Uzama ukuthatha indawo.
We have to go.	Kuya kufuneka sihambe.
I know one way to do this.	Ndiyayazi indlela enye yokwenza oku.
He didn't have to come up with anything.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba eze nantoni na.
Something is happening too.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kwaye.
You can do all that here.	Ungayenza yonke loo nto apha.
He says he wants more time.	Uthi ufuna ixesha elingakumbi.
Not much there, obviously.	Akukho kakhulu apho, ngokucacileyo.
He didn't think he really wanted to know.	Wayengacingi ukuba ufuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
A woman should be this.	Umfazi kufuneka abe lo.
I wonder how this will happen.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kuya kwenzeka njani oku.
We are going to town.	Siya edolophini.
Work, work, work.	Umsebenzi, umsebenzi, umsebenzi.
But he cannot do it alone.	Kodwa akanakuyenza yedwa.
Not so soon.	Hayi ngoku kungekudala.
He loves her, and he loves her.	Uyayithanda, kwaye uyamthanda.
I want to be tough.	Ndifuna ukuba nzima.
Money for convenience.	Imali ukuze kube lula.
I will have to learn.	Kuya kufuneka ndifunde.
But he did not know where.	Kodwa wayengazi apho.
To us, this is a really good thing.	Kuthi, le yinto entle ngokwenene.
I don't know either.	Nam andazi.
Not a really good thing.	Hayi into entle ngokwenene.
Not just speculation.	Hayi nje ukucinga.
So, let's start here.	Ke, siza kuqala apha.
I'm not sure what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
Some, but not so much.	Abanye, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
But maybe not now.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ngoku.
He didn't tell me anything.	Khange andixelele nto.
That should be good enough.	Oko kufuneka kube kuhle ngokwaneleyo.
No reason, really.	Akukho sizathu, ngokwenene.
No, you can't get out.	Hayi, awukwazi ukuphuma.
You can't stop.	Awukwazi ukuyeka.
You should not have it.	Akufanele ube nayo.
I don't care either.	Nam andikhathali.
Good plan.	Licebo elihle.
Okay, but the problem is.	Ulungile, kodwa ingxaki.
Not now and it never was.	Hayi ngoku kwaye akuzange kube njalo.
In the end, though.	Ekugqibeleni, nangona kunjalo.
I go regularly.	Ndiya rhoqo.
You know, my mom.	Uyazi, umama wam.
He said nothing about it.	Akazange athethe nto ngaloo nto.
And it can be anyone.	Kwaye inokuba nabani na.
I may have forgotten.	Inokuba ndilibele.
Something bigger than me.	Into enkulu kunam.
I love the way you did it though.	Ndiyayithanda indlela owenze ngayo kodwa.
It could be anything.	Inokuba yintoni.
Then it will be just me and him.	Emva koko iya kuba ndim naye kuphela.
Don't think.	Musa ukucinga .
He was clearly afraid.	Wayesoyika ngokucacileyo.
Some, maybe.	Abanye, mhlawumbi.
He finished immediately.	Wagqiba kwangoko.
I feel tired and exhausted most of the time.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe kwaye ndidiniwe ixesha elininzi.
He was not alone, however.	Akazange abe yedwa, nangona kunjalo.
Exit immediately afterwards.	Ukuphuma ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
It can be hard to.	Kunokuba nzima ukuba .
I did everything.	Ndenze yonke into.
Not only that here.	Akukho ukuba kuphela apha.
All of this is good.	Konke oku kulungile.
I know I am the only one.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba ndim kuphela.
We will do the same.	Siza kwenza njalo.
Too much trouble, you know.	Ingxaki eninzi kakhulu, uyazi.
Now everything is done at home.	Ngoku yonke into yenziwe ekhaya.
He just did a better job like that.	Wenza nje umsebenzi ongcono ngolo hlobo.
Yes, he would get one.	Ewe, wayeza kufumana enye.
Sorry, only for cash purchases.	Uxolo, ukuthenga ngemali kuphela.
Do you really.	Ngaba ngokwenene .
Not three days.	Hayi iintsuku ezintathu.
You may be sitting in an unfamiliar place.	Usenokuba uhleli kwindawo engaqhelekanga.
His mother sat in front.	Umama wakhe wahlala ngaphambili.
Whatever one wants.	Nokuba umntu ufuna ntoni na.
So much for making peace.	Kakhulu ekwenzeni uxolo.
Everyone is looking at each other.	Wonke umntu ujonge omnye.
Music only now.	Umculo kuphela ngoku.
He will not return until evening.	Akayi kubuya kude kube ngokuhlwa.
This person is trying to help.	Lo mntu uzama ukunceda.
New phone.	Ifowuni entsha.
Look at my time.	Jonga ixesha lam.
So he likes to go.	Ngoko uthanda ukuhamba.
But he wanted his vision.	Kodwa wayefuna ukubona kwakhe.
And not too early.	Kwaye akukho kwangethuba.
In this case, for a long time.	Kule meko, ixesha elide.
This person cannot do that.	Lo mntu akanakuyenza loo nto.
He doesn't look so bad, this way.	Akabonakali embi kangako, ngale ndlela.
We will be able to help you as soon as possible.	Siza kukwazi ukukunceda ngokukhawuleza.
I really want to work with him.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukusebenza naye.
I know exactly what this is.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni le.
For what, he did not speak.	Kuba yintoni, akazange athethe.
He has never been here.	Akazange abe lapha.
You will have to do good work with it.	Kuya kufuneka wenze umsebenzi olungileyo ngayo.
He is the one who comes after me.	Nguye oza emva kwam.
It is good to think about it.	Kuhle ukuba ucinga ngayo.
It happens to be true.	Kwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
Up in this place.	Phezulu kule ndawo.
Just being nice to each other.	Ukuba nje kakuhle omnye komnye.
You are my person.	Ungumntu wam.
If he does.	Ukuba enjenjalo .
He loves everyone and everything.	Uthanda wonke umntu nayo yonke into.
She has told all my friends.	Uye waxelela bonke abahlobo bam.
I want everyone to do it with me.	Ndifuna wonke umntu ayenze nam.
But something so bad.	Kodwa into embi ngolo hlobo.
Everything, everything at a time.	Yonke into, yonke into ngexesha.
And it's all true.	Kwaye yonke yinyani.
He handed me his phone.	Wandinika ifowuni yakhe.
No one asked how he got there.	Akukho mntu wabuza ukuba uze njani apho.
Maybe you got a name.	Mhlawumbi wafumana igama .
It will probably take longer.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuthatha ixesha elide.
Or in a car.	Okanye emotweni .
Not in the house.	Hayi endlini.
So he sits in front of me.	Ngoko uhlala phambi kwam.
However, he did not succeed.	Kodwa ke akazange aphinde aphumelele.
So it has not been as easy as you think.	Ngoko akuzange kube lula njengoko ucinga.
He does things well.	Wenza izinto kakuhle.
That is why there is such a problem.	Yiyo loo nto kukho loo ngxaki.
But he never did that.	Kodwa akazange akhe enze ngolu hlobo.
You say one thing and do another.	Uthetha into enye kwaye wenze enye.
To say it.	Ukuya kuthetha.
So he retired.	Ngoko, wathatha umhlala-phantsi.
There was no need for it to happen.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba yenzeke.
I think about this a lot.	Ndicinga ngale nto kakhulu.
I make a lot of money.	Ndenza imali eninzi.
It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kum.
he finished.	wagqiba.
And now he understood.	Kwaye ngoku waqonda.
I came with him.	Ndize naye.
He wanted to be alone for a long time.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa ixesha elide.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna ukuthetha nam.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba yeyiphi ingxaki apha.
Something very bad is about to happen.	Kukho into embi kakhulu eyenzekayo.
He never had her, he talked to her.	Akazange abe naye, wathetha naye.
If so.	Ukuba kunjalo.
People, this is happening.	Abantu, oku kwenzeka.
Not a few years.	Hayi iminyaka embalwa.
It would look good on him.	Bekuya kubonakala kakuhle kuye.
You know you want to make it hard for everyone.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna ukwenza kube nzima kuye wonke umntu.
Sorry, really, really.	Uxolo, ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
I will not do that to you.	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto kuwe.
I'll go with that.	Ndiya kuhamba kunye naloo nto.
I want a father now.	Ndifuna utata ngoku.
And you have been there for a very long time.	Kwaye ube khona ixesha elide kakhulu.
And it really isn't that hard.	Kwaye ngokwenene akukho nzima.
Maybe there is another way.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela.
He seems to be doing much better.	Ubonakala esenza ngcono kakhulu.
A few weeks, maybe.	Iiveki ezimbalwa, mhlawumbi.
He never told me his name.	Akazange andixelele igama lakhe.
He thought about it all.	Wacinga ngayo yonke loo nto.
Thinking about it now.	Ukucinga ngayo ngoku .
So off you went.	Ngoko ke uhambe.
They live in a park.	Bahlala epakini.
But you are right about it.	Kodwa ulungile ngayo.
But do not hold back.	Kodwa musa ukuzibamba.
And you? 	Kwaye wena?
Maybe you should do that a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka wenze oko kancinci.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siza kuyenza.
Not so, but it is possible.	Akunjalo, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
You told all your friends.	Uxelele bonke abahlobo bakho.
But there is no reason for this to be true.	Kodwa akukho sizathu sokuba oku kube yinyani.
Maybe a few hours.	Mhlawumbi iiyure ezimbalwa.
It always seems to be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi kuhlala kunjalo.
At the moment .	Ngelo xesha .
I don't have to talk to you anymore.	Akufunekanga ndiphinde ndithethe nawe.
Otherwise, you will be alone.	Ngaphandle koko, uya kuba yedwa.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, nguye.
I just want to know his name.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi igama lakhe.
He tried to get the money from her but could not.	Wazama ukufumana loo mali kuye kodwa akazange akwazi.
Maybe he didn't know.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi.
And this, you know.	Kwaye oku, uyazi.
Soon you think.	Kungekudala ucinge.
I don’t remember more than that.	Andikhumbuli ngaphezu koko.
Slowly, but still.	Kancinci, kodwa kunjalo.
No, back there.	Hayi, emva phaya.
Everyone knew why.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
I thought you were leaving last night.	Bendicinga uhamba phezolo .
Mary told him everything about it.	UMariya wamxelela yonke into ngayo.
None of us want to be here.	Akukho namnye kuthi ofuna ukuba lapha.
Maybe you want another one to go to him.	Mhlawumbi ufuna enye ukuya kuye.
I know about you.	Ndiyazi ngawe .
He works hard everywhere.	Usebenza nzima kuyo yonke indawo.
There is another problem.	Kukho enye ingxaki.
He said he wanted something else.	Wathi ufuna enye into.
You will definitely buy it again !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuthenga kwakhona!.
I do not believe much.	Andikholelwa kakhulu.
Or it may be more unusual.	Okanye inokuba yinto engaqhelekanga ngakumbi.
I came to you.	ndize kuwe.
But it is okay to stay ready.	Kodwa kulungile ukuhlala ulungile.
That will be me soon.	Oko kuya kuba ndim kungekudala.
And now everyone thinks he can do it, too.	Ke ngoku wonke umntu ucinga ukuba angayenza, naye.
I think that's a good thing too.	Nam ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
This morning it happened again.	Ngale ntsasa yenzeke kwakhona.
We should be in bed.	Sifanele ukuba ebhedini.
But that means something else.	Kodwa oko kuthetha enye into.
Lots of problem.	Ingxaki eninzi.
That's our new thing.	Yinto yethu entsha leyo.
If not now.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku.
There is no place for you.	Akukho ndawo yakho.
Unless there is another.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho enye.
Tomorrow early.	Ngomso ekuqaleni.
And great.	Kwaye enkulu.
I'm happy with it.	Ndiyavuya ngayo.
He ran well.	Wabaleka kakuhle.
Even if the music comes to you.	Nokuba umculo uza kuwe.
She may have been scared.	Umele ukuba wayesoyika.
Maybe you came after you first.	Mhlawumbi uze emva kwakho kuqala.
Nobody talks about it.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngayo.
He walked to the bedroom.	Wahamba waya egumbini lokulala.
Yeah, that's exactly it.	Ewe, loo nto kanye.
He stayed in his place.	Wahlala kwindawo yakhe.
No, you know that.	Hayi, uyayazi loo nto.
I'm going to have to talk to him about it.	Kuza kufuneka ndithethe naye ngayo.
Sounds like, okay.	Kubonakala ngathi, kulungile.
This, and it means.	Oku, kwaye kuthetha.
So he had to try again.	Ngoko kwafuneka azame kwakhona.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho namnye.
He refused to talk.	Akazange avume ukuthetha.
I know you don't want to do that.	Ndiyazi ukuba awufuni kuyenza loo nto.
You know how lucky you are.	Uyazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani na.
I don't like this place.	Andiyithandi le ndawo.
But he did.	Kodwa wenza njalo.
He only loves my mother.	Uthanda umama wam kuphela.
And if he came down immediately.	Kwaye ukuba wehla kwangoko.
I saw that last night.	Ndibone oko phezolo.
I want everything he has.	Ndifuna yonke into yakhe.
He was.	Waba .
I would really like to stay here.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuhlala apha.
It’s not just about staying there.	Akunjalo nje ukuhlala apho.
I'm not saying you should do that.	Andithi kufuneka wenze njalo.
Everything is fine though.	Yonke into ilungile kodwa.
I know everyone is here.	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ulapha.
That's one thing most people say.	Nantso enye abantu abaninzi bathi.
How do you feel about it ?.	Uziva njani ngayo?.
Not that it will stay, of course.	Akunjalo ukuba iya kuhlala, kunjalo.
But he seldom stays with us.	Kodwa akafane ahlale nathi.
He did not say or do anything.	Zange athethe nto okanye enze nto.
But as you like.	Kodwa njengoko uthanda.
Of course Tom is not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uTom akunjalo.
We will go there.	Siza kuya apho.
Of course, you like this one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayithanda le nto kanye.
I don’t remember much at that time though.	Andikhumbuli kakhulu ngelo xesha nangona kunjalo.
And he got permission immediately.	Kwaye wafumana imvume ngokukhawuleza.
There must be something about him.	Kumele ukuba kukho into ngaye .
He slept a little this morning.	Ulele kancinci namhlanje ekuseni.
He has moved on.	Uye waya phambili.
See how well you do.	Jonga ukuba wenze kakuhle kangakanani.
Not only that, you know.	Akunjalo kuphela, uyazi.
He doesn't know what to do about it.	Akazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
Now, it's better.	Ngoku, kungcono.
He seems to be doing a lot.	Ubonakala esenza okuninzi.
So he finally agreed.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni wavuma.
Or maybe two weeks.	Okanye mhlawumbi iiveki ezimbini.
If you spend your money.	Ukuba uchitha imali yakho.
I can't see why.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba kutheni.
He knows everything about me.	Wazi konke ngam.
But his mind.	Kodwa ingqondo yakhe.
But a good call.	Kodwa umnxeba olungileyo.
He will do it later.	Uya kuyenza kamva.
I know I'm doing wrong.	Ndiyazi ukuba ndenza kakubi.
And now you have to go.	Kwaye ngoku kufuneka uhambe.
He stayed, by the way.	Wahlala, ngendlela.
And there is a problem here.	Kwaye kukho ingxaki apha.
I just wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza nje ngaloo nto.
Just a house.	Indlu nje.
Next to him on the bed.	Ecaleni kwakhe ebhedini.
I think everyone was scared.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu wayesoyika.
However, there is one problem.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki enye.
But, as you know, that is impossible.	Kodwa, njengoko uyazi, oko akunakwenzeka.
So he told me.	Undixelele ke .
It will be very difficult to think too far.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu ukucinga kude kakhulu.
Yeah, sorry about that.	Ewe, uxolo ngaloo nto.
No one was saying anything at school.	Akukho mntu wayethetha nto esikolweni.
But she never stopped thinking about it.	Kodwa akazange ayeke ukucinga ngaloo nto.
This will not be the case though.	Oku akuyi kuba njalo nangona kunjalo.
No one is looking at anyone else.	Akukho mntu ujonge omnye umntu.
But please come quickly.	Kodwa nceda ufike ngokukhawuleza.
You always think you are doing the right thing.	Uhlala ucinga ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
That happened again the other day.	Oko kwenzeka kwakhona ngenye imini.
I love it and you know you do it, too.	Ndiyayithanda kwaye uyazi ukuba uyayenza, nawe.
It is also completely impossible.	Kwakhona akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
Or this.	Okanye oku.
It happens all the time there.	Kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha apho.
Coming here.	Ukuza apha.
Again, no one did anything.	Kwakhona, akukho mntu wenza nto.
I can do this now.	Ndingayenza le nto ngoku.
He did not know where it was.	Wayengazi ukuba iphi.
And so that's it.	Kwaye ke yiloo nto.
He is scared to death today.	Woyika ukufa namhlanje.
Death is your friend.	Ukufa ngumhlobo wakho.
You probably know that by now.	Usenokuba uyazi ukuba ngoku.
But, yes, this is good.	Kodwa, ewe, oku kuhle.
He said he had to leave.	Wathi kufuneka ahambe.
And it should be here.	Kwaye kufuneka elapha.
Inside was nothing.	Ngaphakathi kwakungekho nto.
Yes, all the money.	Ewe, yonke imali.
You will make a lot of money that way, too.	Uya kwenza imali eninzi ngaloo ndlela, nawe.
We want to be there.	Sifuna ukuba lapho.
Everyone knew about him.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngaye.
You will be able to travel with children.	Uya kukwazi ukuhamba nabantwana.
And I am.	Kwaye ndim.
Moreover, there was no food in the house.	Ngaphezu koko, kwakungekho kutya endlwini.
Or it seemed to him.	Okanye kwakubonakala kuye.
Or you just know.	Okanye uyazi nje.
I will come alone.	Ndiza kuza ndedwa.
Not always, but when he does, check it out.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa xa ekwenza, jonga phandle.
Yes, he is really here.	Ewe, ulapha ngenene.
I can just do it.	Ndingayenza nje.
It was all human speech.	Yonke le nto yayithethwa ngumntu.
I don't want it to be like work.	Andifuni kube ngathi ngumsebenzi.
Maybe it will be time.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba lixesha.
They will try anything.	Baza kuzama nantoni na.
This is your job, this is your job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wakho, lo ngumsebenzi wakho.
He didn't seem to know.	Wayengabonakali ukuba uyazi.
There is no such person out there.	Akukho mntu unjalo apha phandle.
Now he wants to talk to both of us.	Ngoku ufuna ukuthetha nathi sobabini.
No further.	Akukho phambili ngakumbi.
I never thought about him.	Zange ndicinge ngaye.
Certainly not that difficult.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nzima kangako.
However, you know, it could be.	Nangona kunjalo, uyazi, kunokuba njalo.
If there are people outside.	Ukuba kukho abantu ngaphandle.
Because you can't know.	Ngenxa yokuba awukwazi ukwazi.
It is better to eat.	Kungcono ukutya.
Here, he knew he would be talking to himself.	Apha, wayesazi ukuba uza kube ethetha yedwa.
He may not be visible.	Usenokuba akabonakali.
So, now you have to be.	Ke, ngoku kufuneka ube njalo.
He wanted to go everywhere.	Wayefuna ukuhamba yonke indawo.
Obviously, it is not easy to talk about it.	Kucacile ukuba akukho lula ukuthetha ngayo.
Later, he advised, he agreed.	Kamva, wacebisa, wavuma.
Well, now and then, maybe.	Ewe, ngoku kwaye kwakhona, mhlawumbi.
And you want to do just that.	Kwaye ufuna ukwenza loo nto kanye.
And what.	Kwaye yintoni na.
He was the first person to leave.	Waba ngumntu wokuqala ukuhamba.
But you arrived late.	Kodwa ufike emva kwexesha.
Help guard.	Siza kulinda.
Long after that.	Kudala emva koko.
What are you doing there.	Wenza ntoni apho .
But you are lucky, there.	Kodwa unethamsanqa, apho.
I got back a little too far.	Ndifike ngasemva kancinci kakhulu.
And I did not.	Kwaye andizange.
I think there is something to that.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into kuloo nto.
He went to prison.	Waya entolongweni.
His name, he thought quickly.	Igama lakhe, wacinga ngokukhawuleza.
He understood.	Waqonda.
He looked everywhere.	Wajonga yonke indawo.
This will not happen again.	Oku akuyi kuphinda.
But, more on that later.	Kodwa, ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
She is intelligent, and she works hard.	Ukrelekrele, kwaye usebenza nzima.
really really.	ngokwenene ngokwenene.
And you came here last night.	Kwaye uze apha phezolo.
It means a lot.	Kuthetha ukuba kakhulu.
I'll go if you want.	Ndiya kuhamba ukuba uyafuna.
We'll see you after lunch.	Siza kubona emva kwesidlo sasemini.
Do you and him.	Ngaba wena kunye naye .
We just want it to be good.	Sifuna nje ukuba kube kuhle.
You will have it.	Uza kuba nayo.
You want to buy.	Ufuna ukuthenga.
It's not what he did.	Asiyonto ayenzileyo.
It's something very special.	Yinto ethile kakhulu.
Not now, but someday.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa ngenye imini.
I live at home.	Ndihlala ekhaya.
There is just a case.	Kukho ityala nje.
The question, however, is whether it is true.	Umbuzo, kunjalo, kukuba ingaba yinyani.
It's hard for me to say.	Kunzima kum ukuthetha.
He came in to me.	Wangena kum.
That is what happened next.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke emva koko.
Whatever happened yesterday.	Nokuba kwenzeke ntoni izolo.
He didn't want to play with her.	Wayengafuni ukudlala naye.
I stay the night.	Ndihlala ubusuku.
There is good money in it.	Kukho imali elungileyo kuyo.
I thought she was so beautiful.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhle kakhulu.
We all need to be together in this.	Sonke kufuneka sibe kunye kule nto.
All the while you just sit there.	Ngalo lonke ixesha uhleli nje.
He did not simply tell the doctor about it.	Akazange nje amxelele ugqirha ngayo.
He never really made friends.	Akazange abe nabahlobo ngokwenene.
Not time.	Hayi ixesha.
I don’t have to think he does.	Akufunekanga ndicinge ukuba uyayenza.
Maybe it will happen later.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka kamva.
Probably not coffee.	Mhlawumbi hayi ikofu.
I want to go, too.	Ndifuna ukuhamba, nam.
You say something to him.	Uthetha into kuye.
I will do whatever you want me to do.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na ofuna ndiyenze.
He knows exactly why he is here.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni elapha.
Where are they going?	Baza kuya phi ke.
I had to stay with him for dinner.	Kwafuneka ndihlale naye ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
But that's the thing.	Kodwa nantso into.
But not my daughter.	Kodwa hayi intombi yam.
And there is another problem.	Kwaye kukho enye ingxaki.
He must be with us.	Ufanele abe nathi.
I hope so because of you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo ngenxa yakho.
You know what happens when you think.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni xa ucinga.
She loves all of that.	Uyayithanda yonke loo nto.
Or not so much.	Okanye hayi kakhulu.
True, though.	Yinyani, nangona kunjalo.
He died, you know.	Wafa, uyazi.
You need to be able to do this.	Kufuneka ukwazi ukwenza oku.
And so it is not.	Kwaye ke akunjalo.
You have never done such a thing.	Zange wenze into enjalo.
Or very early.	Okanye ekuseni kakhulu.
He talked about everything.	Wathetha ngayo yonke into.
We will talk here.	Siza kuthetha apha.
Or maybe I'm tired.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndidiniwe.
But you will not get to that.	Kodwa akuyi kufika kuloo nto.
He soon realized what it was.	Ngokukhawuleza waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
I know it's a bad thing to say.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinto embi ukuyithetha.
There are many books.	Kukho iincwadi ezininzi.
But he was nowhere to be seen.	Kodwa wayengabonakali ndawo.
Then one after another.	Emva koko omnye emva koko.
I did not want anyone.	Bendingafuni mntu.
He lay down in prison.	Walala phantsi entolongweni.
I want to stay with him.	Ndifuna ukuhlala naye.
I just love that.	Ndiyayithanda nje loo nto.
I can't stop my wait now.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukulinda kwam ngoku.
Everyone loves something new.	Wonke umntu uthanda into entsha.
I don't care about my time.	Andikhathali nexesha lam.
You said nothing to me.	Zange uthethe nto kum.
He's not going to do it, he thought.	Akayi kuyenza, wacinga.
Yes and yes and yes.	Ewe kwaye ewe kwaye ewe.
A few other things, not so much.	Ezinye izinto ezimbalwa, hayi kakhulu.
He lay down, and lay down.	Walala, walala phantsi.
But then we have to have it.	Kodwa ke kufuneka sibe nayo.
It has to be done just once.	Kufuneka yenziwe kanye nje.
And he is the one who is really coming.	Kwaye nguye oza ngenene.
No one is talking to me here.	Akukho mntu uthetha nam apha.
It's the only thing.	Yinto kuphela.
I only want my new one.	Ndifuna entsha yam kuphela.
One small mistake.	Impazamo enye encinci.
I think that means staying.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuthetha ukuhlala.
I know you love to read.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyathanda ukufunda.
He also did not go.	Naye akazange ahambe.
This may be true, but it is very difficult.	Oku kunokuba yinyani, kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
But we will get to it in the end.	Kodwa siza kufika kuyo ekugqibeleni.
He probably knew he wouldn't be.	Usenokuba wayesazi ukuba akayi kuba.
He said it would be fun.	Wathi kuya kuba mnandi oko.
Only better, much better.	Kuphela ngcono, ngcono kakhulu.
Yes, there is another.	Ewe, kukho enye.
The gun went off.	Umpu wemka.
He seems to be doing just that.	Ubonakala esenza kanye loo nto.
But no one knew.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi.
Nice place though.	Indawo entle nangona.
I would like to know how it happened.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
And that is good and right.	Kwaye oko kulungile kwaye kulungile.
He remained that way for years.	Wahlala enjalo iminyaka.
Finishing work.	Ukugqiba umsebenzi.
Only way, only way.	Indlela kuphela, indlela kuphela.
But way too fast.	Kodwa indlela ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Maybe it's better that way.	Mhlawumbi kungcono ngolo hlobo.
This makes it easier to work together.	Oku kwenza kube lula ukusebenza kunye.
He never left.	Akazange ahambe kwaphela.
But also going forward.	Kodwa kwakhona ukuya phambili.
Give me a letter.	Ndinike ileta.
He was not good at it.	Wayengekho kakuhle kuyo.
Then he walked out of the room.	Emva koko waphuma egumbini.
Taking his time.	Ukuthatha ixesha lakhe.
Getting everything.	Ukufumana yonke into.
I have waited too long.	Ndilinde ixesha elide kakhulu.
I didn't know what to do with it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngayo.
He would say something to her.	Wayeza kuthetha into kuye.
He's busy, you know.	Uxakekile, uyazi.
You're talking about it.	Uthetha ngaloo nto.
He thought he was playing for time.	Wayecinga ukuba udlala ngexesha.
Apparently he lived alone.	Ngokucacileyo wayehlala yedwa.
All my fault.	Impazamo yam yonke.
Yes, a good time.	Ewe, ixesha elihle.
And maybe think more.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ukucinga ngakumbi.
We will all do the same.	Sonke siya kwenza njalo.
Don't get out of this situation.	Musa ukuphuma kule meko.
He wanted to know all about me.	Wayefuna ukwazi konke ngam.
A place after that.	Indawo emva koko.
He knew he had to succeed.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka aphumelele.
Even though he was not really me.	Nangona wayengekho nyani kum.
Even just a little bit.	Nokuba nje encinci.
Later it is better.	Kamva kungcono.
That would be painful.	Oko bekuya kuba buhlungu.
However, not the best.	Kodwa ke, hayi ngcono.
I'm not sure which one so far.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yeyiphi okwangoku.
It's hard to see how.	Kunzima ukubona ukuba njani.
One is scared.	Omnye uyoyika.
Also, you need to come to the office.	Enye into, kufuneka uze eofisini.
You always have it.	Uhlala unayo.
Just walking, though.	Ukuhamba nje, nokuba.
It seems to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi yinyani .
No, my mother thought that.	Hayi, umama wayecinga loo nto.
Breakfast was a wonderful treat.	Isidlo sakusasa sibe mnandi kakhulu.
He got out of there, really.	Waphuma apho, ngokwenene.
What a problem that could be.	Inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze oko.
Made more human.	Yenziwe umntu ngakumbi.
He would demand money.	Wayeza kufuna imali.
Really, right.	Ngokwenene, ilungile.
Even if the work is busy.	Nokuba umsebenzi uxakekile.
We'll start soon.	Siza kuqala kungekudala.
At that time about.	Ngelo xesha malunga.
Sorry, you can't find this one.	Uxolo, awukwazi ukufumana le.
I'm not sure about that now.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto ngoku.
And it could be.	Kwaye inokuba.
I thought you should know.	Ndicinge ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
I want to know about him.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngaye.
So it seems like yes.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi ewe.
He knew something strange.	Wayesazi into engaqhelekanga.
Then he fell asleep.	Kwangoko walala.
I know the answer to that.	Ndiyayazi impendulo kuyo.
He can say what he wants.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha into ayifunayo.
This he did not agree with.	Oku akazange avume.
It didn't hurt that much.	Akuzange kube buhlungu kangako.
But it will be soon.	Kodwa uya kuba kungekudala.
Except for one moment.	Ngaphandle kwexesha elinye.
It will be exactly the same.	Kuya kuba njalo kanye.
I want you to stay here.	Ndifuna ukuba uhlale apha.
That means it will be fine.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
To be honest, he doesn't have the time.	Ukuthetha inyani, akanalo ixesha.
Well, now it's very good.	Kulungile, ngoku kuhle kakhulu.
I had to stay home all day.	Kwafuneka ndihlale ekhaya imini yonke.
My call is totally.	Umnxeba wam ngokupheleleyo.
Yes, he had to learn to eat.	Ewe, kwafuneka afunde ukutya.
Then he spoke clearly.	Emva koko wathetha ngokucacileyo.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa ke kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
He says, this is the case.	Uthi, oku kunjalo.
This can be very difficult at a party.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu epatini.
And look at that.	Kwaye jonga loo nto.
He didn't know what was behind him.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni emva kwakhe.
She is trying to stop.	Uzama ukuyeka.
In everything there is a time.	Kuyo yonke into kukho ixesha.
A gift to me.	Isipho kum.
If he certainly wasn't.	Ukuba ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho.
I really know him.	Ndiyamazi ngokwenene.
The woman stayed at home.	Umfazi wahlala ekhaya.
I will definitely be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuba njalo.
If you do not know it, stop reading now.	Ukuba awuyazi, yeka ukufunda ngoku.
He said it never happened.	Wathi akuzange kwenzeke.
It will happen, too.	Kuya kwenzeka, kwakhona.
Otherwise, no one says how long you have to wait.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho mntu uthi kufuneka ulinde ixesha elingakanani.
I think what it is, it will need another one someday.	Ndicinga ukuba yintoni na, iya kufuna enye ngenye imini.
There is just something else.	Kukho nje enye into.
I'm sure there is one.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho enye.
Again, it is possible, but not impossible.	Kwakhona, kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
This should happen to you.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke kuwe.
But he knew that was not the case.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akunjalo.
I don't know about it.	Andazi ngayo.
And you will have to wait a long time.	Kwaye kuya kufuneka ulinde ixesha elide.
This happened very quickly.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Is this done there? 	Ngaba le nto yenziwe apho?
We all know you have money.	Sonke siyazi ukuba unayo imali.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva engcono kungekudala.
And no one said anything.	Kwaye akukho mntu wathetha nto.
Then why ?.	Khona kutheni?.
All alone.	Konke ndedwa.
We didn’t go much farther, though.	Asizange sihambe kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nantoni na.
Maybe food.	Mhlawumbi ukutya.
I need to talk to her right away.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye kwangoko.
For now, he wanted nothing more.	Okwangoku, wayengafuni nto.
Or his mother.	Okanye umama wakhe.
Just a little bit.	Kuphela nje kancinci.
He said he would succeed.	Wathi uya kuphumelela.
Or just this.	Okanye oku kuphela.
However, something happened.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho into eyenzekayo.
If only for a few days.	Ukuba nje iintsuku ezimbalwa.
He knows it is him.	Uyazi ukuba nguye.
That will do anything good.	Oko kuya kwenza nantoni na elungileyo.
It's true, really.	Yinyani, ngenene.
It shouldn’t be too hard to find.	Akufanele abe nzima kakhulu ukufumana.
Now he could not control himself.	Ngoku akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
Yes, everyone does.	Ewe, wonke umntu wenza njalo.
You are currently trying to access many items.	Okwangoku uzama ukufumana izinto ezininzi.
You are always rich.	Uhlala uceba.
The truth is that he did.	Inyaniso kukuba uyenzile.
Well, not everywhere.	Ewe, akukho ndawo yonke.
I would like to see more of him.	Ndingathanda ukubona ngakumbi kuye.
I need to get to the top quickly.	Kufuneka ndifike phezulu ngokukhawuleza.
I do not always believe.	Andikholelwa njalo mna.
It shouldn’t be too hard to find.	Akufanele kube nzima kakhulu ukufumana.
But if you can't do it, and you can't come.	Kodwa ukuba awukwazi ukuyenza, kwaye awukwazi ukuza.
And so far.	Kwaye kude kube ngoku.
But you know what.	Kodwa uyazi yintoni.
Again, this is not the case here.	Kwakhona, oku akunjalo apha.
I heard about you from him.	Ndive ngawe kuye.
And his picture is good.	Kwaye umfanekiso wakhe ulungile.
This should not have happened, as it never did before.	Oku bekungafanelanga ukuba kwenzeke, njengakuqala.
Here, there is none.	Apha, akukho.
It will be difficult to decide.	Kuya kuba nzima ukwenza isigqibo.
You know that way.	Uyazi ngolo hlobo.
You know, to me.	Uyazi, kum.
At last, .	Ekugqibeleni, .
You are not very visible.	Awubonakali kangako.
She is not in her bed.	Akakho ebhedini yakhe.
Clearly, the same thing.	Ngokucacileyo, into enye.
Then we will go again.	Emva koko siya kuphinda sihambe.
He will wait outside.	Uya kulinda ngaphandle.
At night he ran away from her.	Ebusuku wabaleka ecaleni kwakhe.
I don't know what the problem might be.	Andazi ukuba inokuba iphi ingxaki.
Or really others.	Okanye ngokwenene abanye.
But there is another exception.	Kodwa kukho enye ngaphandle.
I think it takes time.	Ndicinga ukuba kuthatha ixesha.
Finally one of us had to speak.	Ekugqibeleni omnye wethu kwafuneka athethe.
Yeah, that starts.	Ewe, oko kuqala.
But that should not be here or there.	Kodwa oko akufanele kube apha okanye phaya.
I know where he went after dinner.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uye phi emva kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
They say no immediately.	Bathi hayi ngoko nangoko.
You want an answer right away.	Ufuna impendulo ngoko nangoko.
Not alone, of course.	Hayi wedwa, kunjalo.
And just be it.	Kwaye kube nje.
Thank you for being so !!!!.	Enkosi ngokuba njalo !!!!.
He went back to his bedroom.	Wabuyela egumbini lakhe lokulala.
Then he saw others.	Emva koko wabona abanye.
Later it happened first.	Kamva kwenzeka kuqala.
It must be done today.	Kufuneka yenziwe namhlanje.
But that is probably the case.	Kodwa ke mhlawumbi kunjalo.
He did not want to talk too much.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha kakhulu.
Maybe he would come.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuza.
I do not want anyone to say bad things about me.	Andifuni mntu uthetha kakubi ngam.
Not at all.	Akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
One day, you will come to that place.	Ngenye imini, uya kufika kuloo ndawo.
I don’t see much more, though.	Andiboni okuninzi ngakumbi, nangona kunjalo.
What you would like to do.	Oko ungathanda ukwenza.
You should not make the same mistake.	Akufunekanga wenze impazamo efanayo.
We're all going there now.	Sonke siya khona ngoku.
The same is true of many children.	Kunjalo nabantwana abaninzi.
There is always another way.	Kuhlala kukho enye indlela.
It will go with me.	Iza kuhamba nam.
You have that in front of you.	Unayo loo nto phambi kwakho.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni na.
He did.	Wayenza.
I totally know it.	Ndiyakwazi ngokupheleleyo.
Do not leave the room.	Musa ukuphuma egumbini.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
And he is moving very fast.	Kwaye uhamba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
And you look tired.	Kwaye ukhangeleka udiniwe.
He can do it today if he wants to.	Angayenza namhlanje ukuba uyafuna.
If you want to talk, you will come to me.	Ukuba uyafuna ukuthetha, uya kuza kum.
He came back to me.	Wabuyela kum.
He just looks his eyes at you.	Ujonge nje amehlo akhe kuwe.
Not at that time.	Hayi ngelo xesha.
One has to make a mistake.	Umntu kufuneka enze impazamo.
I have to tell her.	Ndifanele ndimxelele.
There are things here that you should look up to.	Kukho izinto apha ekufuneka ujonge phezulu.
I'm just trying to do my job, after all.	Ndizama kuphela ukwenza umsebenzi wam, emva koko.
I will be with you all the time.	Ndiza kuba nawe lonke ixesha.
I can't think of this.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngolu hlobo.
But in this case, nothing.	Kodwa kule meko, akukho nto.
Or maybe outside.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphandle.
All right, you're right.	Kulungile, ulungile.
You need your permission.	Ufuna imvume yakho.
They stayed with him.	Bahlala naye.
He did not.	Akazange .
I'll be back tonight.	Ndiza kubuya ngoku ngokuhlwa.
I mean, completely out.	Ndiya kuthetha, ngaphandle ngokupheleleyo.
For him, just saying something makes it true.	Kuye, ukuthetha nje into ethile kwenza ukuba kube yinyani.
Driving too fast.	Ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
You can't.	Awukwazi .
It's great to be the first one.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba ngowokuqala.
I think we need to do this now.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze le nto ngoku.
Everyone loves the way you did it, you know.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda indlela owenze ngayo, uyazi.
And in that.	Kwaye kuloo nto.
Now he wanted to know why.	Ngoku wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Now look at everyone.	Ngoku jonga wonke umntu.
And he is intelligent.	Kwaye ukrelekrele.
And your name.	Kwaye igama lakho.
You will make this difficult.	Uza kuyenza nzima le nto.
I hope to come here to you soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza apha kuwe kungekudala.
Now he has gone up.	Ngoku uye waya phezulu.
Don't think about it, don't.	Musa ukucinga ngayo, musa.
He does not know when that will be, but he knows it will happen.	Akazi ukuba nini, kodwa uyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Yeah, everything except me.	Ewe, yonke into ngaphandle kwam.
And you probably realized, at last.	Kwaye mhlawumbi waqonda, ekugqibeleni.
I am looking at my wife.	Ndijonge umfazi wam.
It will continue then.	Iza kuqhubeka ke .
He never stopped talking about it.	Akazange ayeke ukuthetha ngayo.
Or to be a friend.	Okanye ukuba ngumhlobo.
No one really knows what will happen.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene into eza kwenzeka.
Is that right ?.	Ngaba kulungile oko?.
Here, he could not speak.	Apha, akazange akwazi ukuthetha.
I wanted to hear.	Bendifuna ndive.
But you do not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube nawe.
But it's hard to say anything.	Kodwa kunzima ukuthetha into.
He ate, slept, ate and slept.	Watya, walala, watya waza walala.
It is very unlikely that he made a mistake.	Akunakwenzeka ngokwenene ukuba enze impazamo.
You talk to me about all that.	Uthetha nam ngayo yonke loo nto.
I want to do something for myself.	Ndifuna ukwenza into ngam.
She is not here yet.	Akakho okwangoku.
Then, all right.	Emva koko, kulungile.
He will stay with us.	Uya kuhlala nathi .
After dinner go to the office.	Emva kwesidlo ukuya eofisini.
I told him a lot.	Ndamxelela okuninzi.
He went down immediately.	Wehla ngoko nangoko.
That one went very well.	Lowo uhambe kakuhle kakhulu.
Well, then, maybe a little bit.	Kulungile, ke, mhlawumbi kancinci.
The reason is a man.	Isizathu yindoda.
One way or another must be done.	Enye indlela okanye enye into kufuneka yenziwe.
There was no one in the office.	Kwakungekho mntu eofisini.
He went into the prison and spent the night there.	Wangena ke entolongweni, walala khona.
I really do.	Ndenza ngokwenene.
You may or may not do it.	Nawe ungayenza okanye awukwazi.
We need to have this.	Kufuneka sibe nayo le nto.
I'm sure you will want to meet me.	Ndiqinisekile uya kufuna ukudibana nawe.
His people are about everything else.	Abantu bakhe malunga nayo yonke enye into.
That's the way we have to go.	Nantso indlela ekufuneka sihambe ngayo.
No one knew what had happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
I think it will be easier.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba lula.
He must have known then.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ngoko.
Great .	Kakhulu .
He did not want more children.	Wayengafuni ukuba nabantwana abaninzi.
I look more and more and he is not.	Ndijonge ngakumbi kwaye ayinguye.
My wife loves him.	Umfazi wam uyamthanda.
You know, for a long time.	Uyazi, ixesha elide.
It will be easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kuwe.
I will only say this.	Ndiza kuthetha oku kuphela.
You probably know something.	Usenokuba uyazi into.
Yes hope.	Ewe lithemba.
Because he does not want us.	Kuba akafuni kuthi.
Nothing now.	Akukho nto ngoku.
No, not very much.	Hayi, hayi kakhulu.
It's so much better for you.	Kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
He is waiting.	Ulindele.
But they stayed.	Kodwa bahlala.
But clearly, no.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, hayi.
Yes because of me.	Ewe ngenxa yam.
You want to have a party all the time.	Ufuna ukwenza itheko ngalo lonke ixesha.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siya kuyenza loo nto.
Taking money now.	Ukuthatha imali ngoku.
Will you do it again?	Ngaba uza kuphinda?
We will know soon.	Siza kukwazi kungekudala.
Without him, of course.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kunjalo.
He will not be the first.	Akayi kuba ngowokuqala.
Besides, no one knew.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho mntu wayesazi.
And far away.	Kwaye kude .
I'm not sure what happened next.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Mom was scared.	UMama wayesoyika.
And immediately.	Kwaye ngoko nangoko.
He said he couldn't tell.	Wathi akakwazi ukuxelela.
Or did you know.	Okanye ngaba uyazi.
It all goes the same way.	Konke kuhamba ngendlela enye.
That's fine.	Kulungile oko.
In the end, everyone will do it.	Ekugqibeleni, bonke baya kwenza.
Yes of course .	Ewe kunjalo .
It's hard to say anything bad.	Kunzima ukuthetha nantoni na embi.
It's not just my thing.	Asiyonto yam nje.
I'm very here.	Ndilapha kakhulu.
There was nowhere for us to go next.	Kwakungekho ndawo yokuba sihambe ecaleni.
It looks like they will stay.	Kubonakala ngathi baya kuhlala.
I want to do this.	Ndifuna ukuyenza le nto.
I think about him a lot.	Ndicinga ngaye kakhulu.
But he doesn't think of me.	Kodwa akacingi ngam.
We should be.	Sifanele ukuba.
I know this is something new for me.	Ndiyazi ukuba le yinto entsha kum.
I feel confident.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile .
It seems to be painful.	Kubonakala kunokuba buhlungu.
I thought it was something to come.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto ezayo.
I definitely want to play with this one more.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna ukudlala ngale nto ngakumbi.
It will not be easy to learn.	Akuyi kuba lula ukufunda.
I knew a lot more.	Ndandisazi okuninzi ngakumbi.
He walks out.	Uhamba phandle.
Probably a lot more.	Mhlawumbi okuninzi ngakumbi.
Just a small problem.	Ingxaki nje encinci.
I don't think you should go.	Ndicinga ukuba akufanele uhambe.
You better go without me.	Kungcono uhambe ngaphandle kwam.
He thought so.	Wacinga ngolo hlobo.
Right away! 	Ngoku nangoku!
But again it was nothing.	Kodwa kwakhona kwakungekho nto.
Really, really.	Ngenene, ngenene.
Of course, it takes time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kuthatha ixesha.
Then look back.	Uze ujonge emva.
If so, he probably knew everything.	Ukuba kunjalo, kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayesazi yonke into.
And this morning.	Kwaye oku kusasa.
Immediately, no problem.	Ngoko nangoko, akukho ngxaki.
Everything is new to him.	Yonke into entsha kuye.
Always thank you.	Ngalo lonke ixesha enkosi.
You think you drink too much.	Ucinga utywala kakhulu.
Or without him.	Okanye ngaphandle kwakhe.
And we need to act fast.	Kwaye kufuneka senze ngokukhawuleza.
Very quickly.	Kakhulu ngokukhawuleza.
And another name.	Kwaye elinye igama.
But you will see it fast enough.	Kodwa uya kubona ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
There is something, however, that needs to be done.	Kukho into, nangona kunjalo, ekufuneka yenziwe.
The problem.	Ingxaki .
I'm sure that's it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiloo nto.
I have had to wait so long.	Sele kufuneka ndilinde ixesha elide kangaka.
Don't be hard.	Musa ukuba nzima.
Do you really think there.	Ngaba ngokwenene ucinga apho.
But everyone else.	Kodwa bonke abanye.
So everything is fine.	Ngoko yonke into ilungile.
Will you be.	Ngaba uya kuba njalo.
I wanted to see his name.	Bendifuna ukubona igama lakhe.
No one asked about me.	Akukho mntu wabuza ngam.
Yesterday, you did just that.	Izolo, wenze kanye loo nto.
This is really new.	Le yinto entsha ngokwenene.
Yeah, yeah, that would be great.	Ewe, ewe, oko kuya kuba kuhle.
And you should, too.	Kwaye ufanele, nawe.
I like this too.	Ndiyayithanda le nto nam.
Impossible though.	Akunakwenzeka nangona kunjalo.
You do not have to tell me that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba undixelele loo nto.
Let me tell you about it.	Makhe ndikuxelele ngayo.
And this is our job.	Kwaye lo ngumsebenzi wethu.
I know you are curious.	Ndiyazi ukuba unqwenela ukwazi.
Make no mistake about it.	Musa ukwenza impazamo omnye komnye.
We will make a decision.	Siza kuthatha isigqibo.
I know you have to do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka uyenze le nto.
Money, of course.	Ngemali, kunjalo.
It just happened to me later.	Kuphela kwenzeka kum kamva.
I love it all, too.	Ndiyayithanda yonke, nam.
Same thing.	Into efanayo.
It could be anything else.	Inokuba yintoni enye .
You have to tell me everything.	Kufuneka undixelele yonke into .
It is best to take only one at a time.	Kungcono ukuthatha enye kuphela ngexesha.
But no one came forward.	Kodwa akukho mntu weza ngaphambili.
I did this alone.	Ndiyenze ndedwa lento.
And you are probably very lucky to have that.	Kwaye mhlawumbi unethamsanqa kakhulu ukuba.
But only on the side.	Kodwa kuphela ecaleni.
There is always music inside of me.	Kuhlala kukho umculo ngaphakathi kum.
I need help now.	Ndifuna uncedo ngoku.
I want to read on.	Ndifuna ukufunda phambili.
All my friends will be there.	Bonke abahlobo bam baya kuba lapho.
I will not be the first.	Andiyi kuba ngowokuqala.
But almost everyone learns to talk.	Kodwa phantse wonke umntu ufunda ukuthetha.
But my children.	Kodwa abantwana bam.
I think tomorrow anyway.	Ndiyacinga ngomso kunjalo.
My turn now.	Ithuba lam ngoku.
Not because of him, but because of me.	Hayi ngenxa yakhe, kodwa ngenxa yam.
You will see more of him.	Uya kubona ngakumbi kuye.
As you go with it.	Njengokuba uhamba nayo.
You do not have to do this.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze oku.
There is no such problem.	Akukho ngxaki enjalo.
Because that is our job.	Kuba ngumsebenzi wethu lowo.
Finding his mother.	Ukufumana umama wakhe .
He also did not appear.	Kwakhona akazange abonakale.
But it does take a lot of time.	Kodwa kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu.
Thinking about everything.	Ukucinga ngayo yonke into.
Really nice place.	Indawo entle ngokwenene.
There was no question about it.	Kwakungekho mbuzo ngayo.
You don't have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube.
I told her as much as I could.	Ndamxelela kangangoko.
Maybe not much is happening there.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apho.
My mother sat down.	Umama wahlala phantsi.
Of course, you are very interested in it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, unomdla kakhulu ngayo.
He looked over at me and turned to me.	Uye wajonga ecaleni kwam wabuyela kum.
Soon he fell asleep.	Kungekudala walala.
The only question is time.	Umbuzo kuphela lixesha.
Let me talk a little bit about it.	Makhe ndithethe kancinci ngayo.
No, there is something wrong with her, she concluded.	Hayi, kukho into engalunganga ngaye, wagqiba.
And, after all, he did well.	Kwaye, emva kwakho konke, wenza kakuhle.
She did not know what he wanted from her.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ntoni kuye.
No, thinking.	Hayi, ukucinga.
Much will surely come.	Okuninzi kuya kuza ngokuqinisekileyo.
I still doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza nangoku.
If not, that's perfectly fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
And he wanted that.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuba.
There is something that we all need to know.	Kukho into apho sonke kufuneka siyazi.
There was no reason for this.	Kwakungekho sizathu kule nto.
I know he can do it.	Ndiyazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
You know what happens.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Not everything there.	Akukho konke apho.
He did nothing in the house.	Akazange enze nto endlwini.
And there is something else that is unusual.	Kwaye kukho enye into engaqhelekanga.
But it is possible for them to build that way.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba bakhe ngaloo ndlela.
There is something there.	Kukho into apho.
You have to do the right thing.	Kufuneka wenze into elungileyo.
It certainly was not necessary.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungeyomfuneko.
If at all.	Ukuba kukho konke.
Maybe you go slowly.	Mhlawumbi uhamba kancinci kancinci.
Tell me exactly what happened.	Ndixelele kanye kanye ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Trying to move immediately.	Ukuzama ukuhamba kwangoko.
In the end, this did not happen.	Ekugqibeleni, oku akuzange kwenzeke.
We know that to be true.	Siyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
I couldn't get out of it.	Andikwazanga ukuphuma kuyo.
He did not say what happened.	Khange athethe into eyenzekayo.
But that's another thing.	Kodwa nantso enye into.
Do you know where it is? 	Uyazi ukuba iphi?
So, a few more days.	Ngoko ke, ezinye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
It is very difficult for you.	Kunzima kakhulu kuwe.
In the meantime, we need another room.	Okwangoku, sifuna elinye igumbi.
I always stay in my place.	Ndihlala ndihlala kwindawo yam.
Unless it is clear that he did.	Ngaphandle kokuba kucacile ukuba wenza njalo.
You will not do it alone.	Awuyi kuyenza wedwa.
But this is really the case.	Kodwa oku kunjalo ngokwenene.
But he knew he needed to eat.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka atye.
I am one person.	Ndingumntu omnye.
I'll have to see how he plays.	Kuya kufuneka ndimbone ukuba udlala njani.
And it seems like a long time.	Kwaye kubonakala ixesha elide.
I think they will stay with you on anything.	Ndicinga ukuba baya kuhlala nawe kuyo nantoni na.
What happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo.
I want you to have it.	Ndifuna ube nayo.
Yes, all is well.	Ewe, konke kungcono.
No, no, that's fine.	Hayi, hayi, kulungile.
I will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
See if you like it, sorry.	Jonga ukuba uyayithanda, uxolo.
Please tell her what you told me.	Ndicela umxelele lento undixelele yona.
I don't think he got many.	Andiqondi ukuba wafumana abaninzi.
I just want to talk about it now.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha ngayo ngoku.
Eventually, they will leave.	Ekugqibeleni, baya kuhamba.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akukho.
I did not hear anything wrong.	Andizange ndive nantoni na embi.
A little too much but for sure.	Kancinci kakhulu kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
So, you know.	Ngoko, uyazi.
That seems like a long time ago.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kudala ngoku.
But that is a fact.	Kodwa yinyani leyo.
Yeah, there's one more thing.	Ewe, kukho enye into encinci.
It’s all about everything.	Konke malunga nayo yonke into.
He didn't do this often, he realized.	Akazange akwenze oku rhoqo, waqonda.
Just look at this.	Jonga nje le nto.
Not always, but not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
This is best for you.	Oku kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
We will not say more.	Asiyi kuthetha ngakumbi.
It's, it's everything.	Yinto, yinto yonke.
He cannot walk or sit.	Akakwazi ukuhamba okanye ukuhlala.
He lay in a hospital bed.	Walala ebhedini esibhedlele.
What is wrong.	Yintoni engalunganga.
Lo, lo.	Lowo, lowo.
Then look back.	Emva koko jonga ngasemva.
But again it never happened.	Kodwa kwakhona akuzange kube njalo.
I'll wait and see.	Ndiza kulinda ndibone.
You will not find any better one here.	Awuyi kufumana enye engcono apha.
I need to know if you want to.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba uyafuna.
And he saw what it was.	Wabona ke ukuba yintoni na.
I do the same thing, the same way, all the time.	Ndenza into enye, ngendlela enye, ngalo lonke ixesha.
But, well, that never happened.	Kodwa, ke, oko akuzange kwenzeke.
No one is at home.	Akukho mntu ekhaya.
It could be anything.	Inokuba yinto yonke.
The food is good, too.	Ukutya kulungile, kakhulu.
And all this for me.	Kwaye konke oku kum.
Others you will see.	Abanye uya kubona.
He knows he has to have it.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
Then he opened the window.	Emva koko wavula ifestile.
But it had to be that way.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba kube njalo.
Tell me all about him.	Ndixelele konke ngaye.
Yes, almost alone.	Ewe, phantse wedwa.
I would like to work with children.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza nabantwana.
The same thing goes to our restaurant.	Into efanayo iya kwindawo yethu yokutyela.
I know.	Mna siyazi.
There is a reason for this.	Kukho isizathu sokuba.
I think everyone will have to do that now.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu kuya kufuneka enze oko ngoku.
I know, you might like something else.	Ndiyazi, ungathanda enye into.
We will be.	Siya kuba .
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into .
No one else does that.	Akakho omnye umntu owenza loo nto.
Bring the monkeys.	Weza nyani.
And you really can't.	Kwaye ngenene awukwazi.
I would like to think about it.	Ndingathanda ukucinga ngayo .
But she hoped he would be her friend.	Kodwa wayenethemba lokuba uya kuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
I know you speak well.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kakuhle.
Please check back.	Nceda ujonge kwakhona.
We want to know about you.	Sifuna ukwazi ngawe.
As soon as you do it better.	Ngokukhawuleza ukuba uyenza ngcono.
Just in case something happened.	Nje ukuba kwenzeke into.
And I told you if you wanted to.	Kwaye ndithethe nawe ukuba uyafuna.
To him or to me.	Kuye okanye kum.
Maybe someone should go.	Mhlawumbi umntu kufuneka ahambe.
This way there is nothing.	Ngale ndlela akukho nto.
I saw everything.	Ndibone yonke into.
That's why.	Yiyo ke ngoko.
There is no one way or another.	Akukho ndlela enye okanye enye.
He wanted to talk about it.	Wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Something terrible is about to happen.	Kukho into embi eza kwenzeka.
How nice, but not.	Kuhle kangakanani, kodwa hayi.
I enjoy working with him.	Ndiyavuya ukusebenza naye.
He talked to me.	Wathetha nam.
But nobody goes there.	Kodwa akukho mntu uhamba apho.
I did not want you to know the truth.	Bendingafuni uyazi inyani.
Then do it.	Emva koko wenze.
And he died shortly thereafter.	Kwaye wafa kungekudala emva koko.
Still, he did his best.	Nangona kunjalo, wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
He decided it was her.	Wagqiba kwelokuba nguye.
He did not say a word.	Khange athethe tu.
Well, then, you are better.	Ewe, ke, ungcono.
He asked for another.	Wacela enye.
For being here at this time.	Ngokuba lapha ngeli xesha.
Or, or, or.	Okanye, okanye, okanye.
We're going there now.	Siya khona ngoku.
Probably a lifetime.	Mhlawumbi ubomi bonke.
He gave me one.	Wandinika enye.
No one ever asked about it.	Akukho mntu wakha wabuza ngayo.
In the evening he lay down on his bed.	Ngokuhlwa walala ebhedini yakhe.
I do work here in your house.	Ndenza umsebenzi apha endlini yakho.
To me, the answer is clearly no.	Kum, impendulo ngokucacileyo hayi.
Maybe that's right.	Mhlawumbi oko kulungile.
I hope you love her.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyamthanda.
Not so, either.	Akunjalo, kwakhona.
He pulled out his phone.	Wakhupha ifowuni yakhe.
But you may be right.	Kodwa unokuba ulungile.
And now you have told everyone.	Ke ngoku uxelele wonke umntu.
However, there are mistakes.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho iimpazamo.
He can't take breakfast.	Akakwazi ukuthatha isidlo sakusasa.
Then another chance.	Emva koko elinye ithuba.
Again, I'm not sure why.	Kwakhona, andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni.
But then you told me you were just interested.	Kodwa ke undixelele ukuba unomdla nje.
And, besides, he didn't even know it was true.	Kwaye, ngaphandle koko, wayengazi nokuba yinyani na.
You can do that in that moment.	Ungayenza loo nto ngelo xesha.
One house.	Indlu enye.
A short stay.	Ukuhlala kancinci.
That is clearly impossible to know.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
Finally the woman went outside.	Ekugqibeleni umfazi wahamba ngaphandle.
I will be a man.	Ndiya kuba yindoda.
I hope you like staying here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyathanda ukuhlala apha.
You know what you want to do and why.	Uyayazi into ofuna ukuyenza nokuba kutheni.
Sure, he did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wenza njalo.
And that's not hard.	Kwaye akukho nzima oko.
He just wanted a little something.	Wayefuna nje into encinci.
He can't talk to her.	Akakwazi ukuthetha naye.
He stayed there for a few days.	Wahlala khona iintsuku ezimbalwa.
But you don't have to.	Kodwa akufuneki.
It is a good thing he has done.	Yinto entle ayenzileyo.
In her bedroom.	Kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
I just can't tell you.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela nje.
He looked like he was.	Wayebonakala ngathi unjalo.
The message came in immediately and looked good.	Umyalezo wangena ngokukhawuleza kwaye wabonakala ulungile.
Or maybe me.	Okanye mhlawumbi mna.
We all know that everyone works at home.	Sonke siyazi ukuba wonke umntu usebenza ekhaya.
You don't want to see what happens the other way around.	Awufuni ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngenye indlela.
There are parents.	Kukho abazali.
But, this is okay.	Kodwa, oku kulungile.
But that's just the way it is.	Kodwa kunjalo nje.
He came to the house and went into his room.	Wafika endlini wangena egumbini lakhe.
He thought of staying.	Wacinga ukuhlala.
I will see a doctor.	Ndiza kubona ugqirha.
Just seeing everything.	Ukubona nje yonke into.
Everyone went for it.	Wonke umntu wahamba ngaye.
You certainly have been right.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ube ulungile.
His mother will go with him.	Umama wakhe uza kuhamba naye.
We need to move faster, though.	Kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza, nangona kunjalo.
I say this all the time.	Ndithetha oku ngalo lonke ixesha.
I mean a big thing.	Ndithetha into enkulu.
So he was going to take a job.	Ngoko wayeza kuthatha umsebenzi.
I think you do too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
He did not know what was going on.	Wayengazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni na.
Do your homework.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho wasekhaya.
However it is not easy to stop doing it.	Nangona kunjalo akukho lula ukuyeka ukuyenza.
He looked around the house at once.	Wajonga indlu yonke ngokukhawuleza.
And look at a few things first.	Kwaye jonga izinto ezimbalwa kuqala.
It will be better, one way or the other.	Kuya kuba ngcono, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
He is committed to it.	Uzimisele ngayo.
He didn't just walk into the room.	Akazange angene nje egumbini.
It would have to be tomorrow, though.	Bekuya kufuneka kube ngomso, nangona kunjalo.
I never did that either.	Nam andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
Just give me something.	Ndinike nje into.
There are some though.	Kukho ezinye nangona.
It's even harder to think about it.	Kude kube nzima ukucinga ngayo.
I never saw him.	Khange ndimbone tu.
Not my place or my name.	Hayi indawo yam okanye igama lam.
How to be good.	Indlela yokuba ulungile.
Moreover, he would not be alone.	Ngaphezu koko, wayengayi kuba yedwa.
That is not what we want to be.	Ayisiyiyo le nto sifuna ukuba kuyo.
You will eat everyone there.	Uza kutya wonke umntu apho.
And if so, that's fine with you.	Kwaye ukuba kunjalo, kulungile kuwe.
You can't tell anyone this.	Awukwazi ukuxelela nabani na oku.
Or you plan to buy one.	Okanye uceba ukuthenga enye.
I want this .	Ndifuna lento .
Do not pretend that one is coming without the other.	Musa ukwenza ngathi omnye uza ngaphandle komnye.
This will be very noticeable.	Oku kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
Tomorrow will be better.	Ngomso kuya kuba ngcono.
I think he has fallen asleep.	Ndicinga ukuba uye walala.
Going with friends.	Ukuhamba nabahlobo.
As you did to him.	Njengoko wenze kuye.
Soon, for sure.	Kungekudala, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Nowhere to answer.	Akukho ndawo impendulo.
But this seems very difficult.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
Because there was no place up there.	Kuba kwakungekho ndawo phaya phezulu.
That is not the case.	Akunjalo oko.
I did not do much.	Khange ndenze nto ingako.
Look at the phone.	Jonga ifowuni.
But he can't drive.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuqhuba.
I like my bike.	Ndiyayithanda ibhayisekile yam.
All of a sudden .	Kungekudala .
Yes he would be here soon.	Ewe wayeza kuba lapha kungekudala.
I doubt you will ever.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uya kuze.
It's not me.	Ayindim .
Not immediately, and not for very long.	Hayi ngoko nangoko, kwaye hayi ixesha elide kakhulu.
I think it should.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka.
I don’t know if we should be.	Andazi ukuba kufuneka sibe njalo.
That's why he went to look for my mother.	Yiyo loo nto waya kufuna umama.
He just did what he wanted to do.	Wenza nje loo nto wayefuna ukuyenza.
So there is no problem with that.	Ngoko ke akukho ngxaki kuloo nto.
Never before has that really happened.	Ngaphambili akuzange kube njalo ngokwenene.
Let me tell you what happened to me.	Makhe ndikuxelele into eyenzekayo kum.
He knew it would end soon.	Wayesazi ukuba iza kuphela kungekudala.
And you are lucky.	Kwaye unethamsanqa.
Sooner than later.	Kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
You have to tell him, and tell him now.	Kufuneka umxelele, kwaye umxelele ngoku.
Just one number for me.	Nje inombolo enye kum.
His first mother.	Umama wakhe wokuqala.
But here you have to be.	Kodwa apha kufuneka ube.
Going your way is not difficult.	Ukuhamba ngendlela yakho akukho nzima.
Yes, you down.	Ewe, wena phantsi.
I want a picture.	Ndifuna umfanekiso.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
And he died immediately, at first.	Kwaye wafa kwangoko, ekuqaleni.
He goes forward.	Uya phambili.
Just a new person.	Umntu omtsha nje.
But not in the same way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela efanayo.
How? 	Njani?
He stayed in the hospital for weeks.	Wahlala esibhedlele iiveki.
All right, better, better.	Kulungile, ngcono, ngcono.
See if you like it.	Jonga ukuba uyathanda.
He said I am more than you.	Wathi mna ngaphezu kwakho.
No matter what anyone wanted.	Nokuba umntu wayefuna ntoni na.
You will definitely want to be with her, too.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufuna ukuba abe naye, naye.
Now look at this place.	Jonga ngoku le ndawo.
Back, back, back.	Emva, ngasemva, ngasemva.
I think he should have told her first.	Ndicinga ukuba bekufanele amxelele kuqala.
Some say he did not.	Abanye bathi akazange.
Or you, obviously.	Okanye wena, ngokucacileyo.
This can be a very big thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto enkulu kakhulu.
He came home from college, and then he went to work.	Wafika ekhaya ekholejini, emva koko waya emsebenzini.
Yeah, nothing right now.	Ewe, akukho nto okwangoku.
He found someone else.	Wafumana omnye umntu.
He wanted her to know.	Wayefuna ukuba azi.
I'm not sure what it is, exactly.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni, kanye.
This, of course, will be me.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba ndim.
You know that will be needed.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kufuneka.
Now everyone is here.	Ngoku wonke umntu ulapha.
Obviously none.	Ngokucacileyo akukho namnye.
She is sitting there today.	Uhleli apho namhlanje.
He thought that was his thing.	Wacinga loo nto yakhe.
That's what he couldn't do.	Yiyo loo nto engazange akwazi ukuyenza.
I will take your place.	Ndiya kuthatha indawo yakho.
You will be very beautiful.	Uya kuba mhle kakhulu.
Yes a little.	Ewe kancinci.
That, that, that man didn't know.	Loo nto, leyo, loo mntu wayengazi.
I thought we were going to have a good time.	Ndandicinga ukuba siza kwenza ixesha elihle.
He said it was okay for you.	Wathi kulungile kuwe.
But this is not always the case.	Kodwa akunjalo rhoqo.
He will all go.	Uya kuhamba bonke.
He ate one after the other.	Watya emva komnye.
Doing things with children.	Ukwenza izinto nabantwana.
And, every morning after that.	Kwaye, rhoqo kusasa emva koko.
I ask that he stay with us.	Ndicela ukuba ahlale nathi.
There is more though.	Kukho ngakumbi nangona.
I want this.	Ndifuna le nto.
That's your money.	Nantso imali yakho.
Moreover, really.	Ngaphezu koko, ngokwenene.
He said okay, okay.	Uthe kulungile, kulungile.
He does not want my money.	Akafuni mali yam.
That's all that's happening now.	Yiloo nto yonke eyenzekayo ngoku.
He felt his way.	Waziva ngendlela yakhe.
Give me a light.	Ndinike isibane.
My mother did not succeed in school.	Umama akazange aphumelele esikolweni.
It makes the work fun.	Wenza umsebenzi ube mnandi.
I want to try to do it myself.	Ndifuna ukuzama ukuyenza ngokwam.
I don't care at all.	Andikhathali kwaphela.
I wish everyone did the same.	Ndinqwenela ukuba wonke umntu enze njalo.
Don't stay inside.	Musa ukuhlala ngaphakathi.
A little bit, now.	Kancinci kancinci, ngoku.
If this is you, then you are in luck.	Ukuba nguwe lo, ke unethamsanqa.
I feel just like you.	Ndiziva kanye njengawe.
He learned immediately.	Wafunda kwangoko.
I love the house more this way really.	Ndiyayithanda indlu ngakumbi ngolu hlobo ngokwenene.
Her mother wants her to stop.	Umama wakhe unqwenela ukuba ayeke.
I just wanted to go up.	Bendifuna nje ukuya phezulu.
And besides, he's too old for me.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, mdala kakhulu kum.
Because we know you like that.	Kuba siyazi ukuba uyayithanda loo nto.
We want to achieve things.	Sifuna ukuphumelela izinto.
Thank you for being with us today.	Enkosi ngokuba nathi namhlanje.
You told me that too.	Nawe undixelele lonto.
Maybe, he knew why he was here.	Mhlawumbi, wayesazi ukuba kutheni elapha.
Children.	Abantwana .
That is good for me.	Ilungile loo nto kum.
Or dad, either.	Okanye utata, nokuba.
i do well.	ndenza kakuhle.
He walks as fast as he can.	Uhamba nje ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
You really love her, you know.	Uyamthanda ngokwenene, uyazi.
And, not least, his music.	Kwaye, hayi kancinci, umculo wakhe.
And well.	Kwaye kakuhle.
And you do not have to bring anything.	Kwaye akukho mfuneko yokuba uze nayo nantoni na.
For now, we just have to do the work.	Okwangoku, kufuneka senze nje umsebenzi.
This means you.	Oku kuthetha wena.
This is happening, really.	Oku kwenzeka, ngokwenene.
He lives in my house.	Uhlala endlwini yam.
Yes that's right.	Ewe kulungile .
No one told her to do it.	Akukho mntu wamxelela ukuba ayenze.
Finally he said no.	Ekugqibeleni wathi hayi.
Now give me your phone.	Ngoku ndinike ifowuni yakho.
Yes, it is good enough.	Ewe, ilungile ngokwaneleyo.
My son loves her very much.	Unyana wam uyamthanda kakhulu.
Whether you know it or not.	Nokuba uyazi okanye hayi.
There is nothing you need to do.	Akukho nto kufuneka uyenze.
He also made too many mistakes.	Kwakhona wenze iimpazamo ezininzi kakhulu.
I just want to sing.	Ndifuna nje ukucula.
It takes a bit, though.	Kuthatha kancinci, nangona kunjalo.
I wanted you to know before you left.	Bendifuna wazi phambi kokuba uhambe.
Everyone is sleeping.	Wonke umntu ulele.
You can just be.	Unokuba nje.
Or not immediately, of course.	Okanye hayi kwangoko, kunjalo.
Maybe he knows for himself.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ngokwakhe.
You just think.	Ucinga nje.
He wanted to help people.	Wayefuna ukunceda abantu.
You do not have to do this work.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze lo msebenzi.
I mean, if he wanted to.	Ndithetha ukuba, ukuba wayefuna.
I could not wait.	Andikwazanga kulinda.
He told me nothing.	Akukho nto wandixelela ngayo.
He did not want to leave his room.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma egumbini lakhe.
It can be almost everything.	Inokuba phantse yonke into.
Maybe for both of us the marriage can be enjoyable.	Mhlawumbi kuthi sobabini umtshato unokuba mnandi.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Kodwa kukho into enye ekufuneka uyazi.
We will get to it.	Siza kufika kuyo.
I think he is a man.	Ndicinga ukuba yindoda.
But this thing.	Kodwa le nto.
You do not really want to know.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
How do you know.	Wazi njani.
I pay attention to everything and everyone.	Ndinike ingqalelo kuyo yonke into kwaye wonke umntu.
You do not have to sit down.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba uhlale phantsi.
No matter when you are here.	Nokuba ulapha nini.
I could not.	Nam andikwazanga.
That has never been done before.	Loo nto ayizange yenziwe ngaphambili.
You can have everything.	Unokuba nayo yonke into.
I know that myself.	Ndiyayazi lonto ngokwam.
You will know that you are there.	Uya kukwazi ukuba ukhona.
He always wants me to be him.	Usoloko efuna ndibe nguye.
But it happened very quickly.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
All about you.	Konke ngawe.
That seemed a long time ago.	Oko kwakubonakala ngathi kudala kakhulu.
Not this morning.	Hayi ngale ntsasa.
We need to know what it is.	Kufuneka siyazi ukuba yintoni na.
You can't get out of it.	Awunako ukuphuma kuyo.
You know exactly what it is at this point.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni kanye kanye ngeli xesha.
We know where he lived.	Siyazi apho wayehlala khona.
You think something is wrong somewhere.	Ucinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga kwindawo ethile.
I don't see it down here.	Andiboni apha phantsi.
I look for something good to say.	Ndijonge into elungileyo ukuthetha.
I don't like this at all.	Andiyithandi tu le nto.
You always have a problem.	Uhlala unengxaki .
Hours, maybe.	Iiyure, mhlawumbi.
If you do, we'll see.	Ukuba wenza njalo, siza kubona.
Maybe a doctor.	Mhlawumbi ugqirha.
This is something new to me.	Le yinto entsha kum.
Maybe you should think again.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka ucinge kwakhona.
I couldn’t stop fast enough.	Andikwazanga ukuyeka ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Because you know he did.	Kuba uyazi ukuba wenza.
He said he was not alone.	Wathi yayingenguye yedwa.
I hope that's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kulungile.
Now he knows what to do.	Ngoku uyayazi into amakayenze.
Nothing in the past, unless it is possible.	Akukho nto ngaphambili, ngaphandle kokuba kunokwenzeka.
Not just here.	Hayi nje apha.
I had to come to him.	Kwafuneka ndize kuye.
Well, stop thinking too much about this.	Kulungile, yeka ukucinga kakhulu ngale nto.
And it should be.	Kwaye kufuneka kube njalo.
There is just you, here and now.	Kukho nje wena, apha kwaye ngoku.
All of this is good.	Konke oku kuhle.
There must be something wrong with it.	Kumele ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngayo.
And he, too.	Kwaye naye, naye.
You play with it a lot.	Udlala ngayo kakhulu.
There is no way at all.	Akukho ndlela kwaphela.
Your wife.	Umfazi wakho .
Just being together.	Ukuba kunye nje.
He has done it now.	Uyenzile ngoku.
And she plans to buy a house someday.	Kwaye uceba ukuthenga indlu ngenye imini.
He started earning money right away.	Waqalisa ukufumana imali ngoko nangoko.
Everything is done on top.	Yonke into yenziwe phezulu.
I think he'll do it, he's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba uza kuyenza, ulungile.
Old controversy.	Utata mdala.
At that moment she went out to work.	Ngelo xesha waphuma waya emsebenzini.
Well, he wasn't, then.	Ewe, wayengekho, ngoko.
And in all of this here.	Kwaye kuyo yonke le nto apha.
That's a big deal.	Nantso into enkulu.
I know you have already done that.	Ndiyazi ukuba sele uyenzile loo nto.
But it is unclear what will happen.	Kodwa kucacile ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
And not without you.	Kwaye hayi ngaphandle kwakho.
We are here to learn.	Siza apha ukufunda.
One beautiful place.	Indawo enye entle.
I make time.	Ndenza ixesha.
It will definitely do better at night.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenza ngcono ebusuku.
Reading my mind.	Ukufunda ingqondo yam.
Stop talking, she thought.	Yeka ukuthetha, wacinga.
Without it, food becomes difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, ukutya kuba nzima.
If you think you already know everything you can't read.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba sele uyazi yonke into awukwazi ukufunda.
I just want to say one word.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha igama elinye.
He had to learn this.	Kwafuneka afunde oku.
This is really good at first.	Oku kuhle ngokwenene ekuqaleni.
Like, really something.	Njengokuba, ngokwenene into.
I can't help this time.	Andikwazi ukunceda ngeli xesha.
He said he was scared.	Wathi wayesoyika.
But only one.	Kodwa enye kuphela.
He looked like that.	Wajonga ngolo hlobo.
That's a strange thing.	Nantso into engaqhelekanga.
I mean, it's just not possible.	Ndiya kuthetha, akunakwenzeka nje.
One lay down and the other slept.	Omnye walala phantsi kwaye omnye walala.
It will be almost two.	Kuya kuba phantse ezimbini.
You need to know about me, this time, enough.	Kufuneka wazi ngam, ngeli xesha, ngokwaneleyo.
Dog, big dog.	Inja, inja enkulu.
He will not be here for another three hours.	Akayi kufika apha ezinye iiyure ezintathu.
You first came here.	Ufike kuqala apha.
I do not want you to go with me.	Andifuni uhambe nam.
When you will find out.	Xa uza kufumana.
He wanted to stay away, he knew.	Wayefuna ukuhlala kude, wayesazi.
I'm just telling my truth.	Ndithetha nje inyani yam.
But he goes with me.	Kodwa uhamba nam.
We need your help to make that happen.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho ukwenza oko kwenzeke.
And then think of us.	Kwaye ke ukucinga ngathi.
Not just one or two, either.	Hayi nje enye okanye ezimbini, nokuba.
I suspect he did not.	Ndiyarhana ukuba akazange.
I never thought of anything.	Khange ndicinge nto tu.
And he did the same thing when he got there.	Kwaye wenza ngendlela efanayo xa efika apho.
My mother is one.	Umama wam enye.
We never went there.	Zange siye apho.
Yeah, you know.	Ewe, uyayazi.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukudlala nathi.
No, there was no way.	Hayi, kwakungekho ndlela.
We will stay together.	Siza kuhlala kunye.
And so, that's exactly what happened.	Kwaye kunjalo, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Talk to you soon!.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala!.
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
He does this all the time.	Wenza oku ngalo lonke ixesha.
Mom looked bad.	UMama wayekhangeleka embi.
So now you will get this.	Ngoko ngoku uya kufumana oku.
There is so much to it.	Kukho kakhulu kuyo.
Now is the only time.	Ngoku lixesha kuphela.
I always do.	Ndihlala ndiyenza.
No, not a gift.	Hayi, hayi isipho.
No one really knew what it was.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene ukuba yintoni na.
He is smart enough to know that.	Ukrelekrele ngokwaneleyo ukuba uyazi loo nto.
It may be longer.	Inokuba mde.
This you have done.	Le nto uyenzile.
To him, to him alone.	Kuye, kuye kuphela.
And dinner, too.	Kwaye isidlo sangokuhlwa, kakhulu.
We've both gone, he thought.	Siye sobabini, wacinga.
There is an opportunity here.	Kukho ithuba apha.
This is not about him.	Oku akukho malunga naye.
All of this requires money.	Konke oku kufuna imali.
Not talking to him, of course.	Hayi ukuthetha naye, kunjalo.
He wants me to go with him.	Ufuna ndihambe naye.
I will be with you.	ndiya kuba nawe.
And now you are driving very fast.	Kwaye ngoku uqhuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He went out to see.	Waphuma waya kubona.
Something like that .	Into enjalo .
No books.	Akukho ncwadi.
Give me your number.	Ndinike inombolo yakho.
This is exactly what he wants.	Yile nto kanye ayifunayo.
He just wanted time to be alone.	Wayefuna nje ixesha lokuba yedwa.
He has never been before.	Akazange abe ngaphambili.
And no one is coming.	Kwaye akukho mntu uya kuza.
My mother can sing.	Umama uyakwazi ukucula.
That might be fine with a meal or two.	Oko kunokuba kuhle ngesidlo okanye ezimbini.
You are already here.	Sele ulapha.
My mother has come down with it.	Umama uye wehla nayo.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa .
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
That would be a very bad thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto embi kakhulu.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga ngawe rhoqo.
He doesn't even have to try to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba azame ukuyenza le nto.
And one more thing,.	Kwaye enye into encinci,.
You just have to look harder.	Kuphela kufuneka ujonge nzima.
There is a window.	Kukho ifestile.
And it looks like he did.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi wenza.
I think you did not know.	Ndicinga ukuba ubungazi.
To this day.	Kude kube namhlanje.
He loves people completely.	Uthanda abantu ngokupheleleyo.
Not so people.	Akunjalo abantu.
This, of course, happens.	Oku, ngokwenene, kwenzeka.
Very much like you.	Kakhulu njengawe.
But he didn't do it tonight.	Kodwa khange ayenze ngokuhlwanje.
They say he tried to kill his wife.	Bathi wazama ukugqiba umfazi wakhe.
He knows where they live.	Uyazi apho bahlala khona.
He can walk slowly.	Uyakwazi ukuhamba kancinci.
Are you interested too?	Ngaba nawe unomdla?
That would be very sad.	Oko bekuya kuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
Now he has done that.	Ngoku uyenzile loo nto.
We'll wait for your call.	Siza kulinda umnxeba wakho.
And this is going to happen.	Kwaye oku kuya kwenzeka.
You read this way.	Ufunda ngale ndlela.
Nowhere did he want to be.	Akukho ndawo wayefuna ukuba kuyo.
And everyone knows.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyazi.
I do not want to stay.	Andifuni ukuhlala.
Thus he learned.	Ngaloo ndlela wafunda.
This will happen everywhere.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
You do not have to think hard.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ucinge nzima.
That happens very often.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo ngokwenene.
Then he gave me his answer.	Emva koko wandinika impendulo yakhe.
No, no, no.	Akukho, akukho, akukho.
One has to just agree to help.	Umntu kufuneka avume nje ukunceda.
Very good question indeed.	Umbuzo omhle kakhulu ngokwenene.
I will be sad.	Ndiya kuba buhlungu.
You are smarter than you think.	Ukrelekrele kunokuba ucinga.
I would like to know what it is.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba yintoni.
You should not think so.	Akufuneki ucinge ukuba kunjalo.
He wanted a car.	Wayefuna imoto.
Not much is happening here.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apha.
They say that it is impossible.	Bathi mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka.
I'd like to see how you do.	Ndingathanda ukubona ukuba uqhuba njani.
Please.	Ndicela nje.
I'm sure I'll try this soon.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ndiza kuzama oku kungekudala.
Then they will see.	Emva koko baya kubona.
You do not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
Well, I have to go.	Kulungile, kufuneka ndihambe.
I'll be together soon.	Ndiza kuba kunye kungekudala.
Not much is happening.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
Not how two.	Hayi indlela ezimbini ngayo.
And even now, he never did.	Kwaye nangoku, akazange.
You know a lot.	Uyayazi into eninzi.
We will be here for you.	Siza kuba apha ngenxa yakho.
And so it is every day.	Kwaye unjalo yonke imihla.
And that goes for everything.	Kwaye oko kuya kuyo yonke into.
You're almost done.	Sele uphantse ukugqiba.
tell me about him again.	ndixelele ngaye kwakhona.
He knew more than anyone else now.	Wayesazi ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na ngoku.
I couldn't go anywhere, to do anything.	Andikwazanga ukuya ndawo, ukwenza nantoni na.
He tried though.	Wazama nangona kunjalo.
But you know, really.	Kodwa uyazi, ngokwenene.
So there is a lot about it.	Ngoko kukho okuninzi malunga nayo.
You do not have to know everything about each other.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wazi yonke into omnye komnye.
He wants to take the car.	Ufuna ukuthatha imoto.
He should not stay here.	Akufunekanga ahlale apha.
I'm afraid to think.	Ndiyoyika ukucinga.
It happens anyway.	Kwenzeka nokuba kunjalo.
I'm glad, you know.	Ndiyavuya, uyazi.
If you will be nice to me.	Ukuba uya kuba mnandi kum.
and he dwelt there.	wahlala apho.
No, of course not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He would soon be traveling alone.	Wayeza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza eyedwa.
I think .	ndiyacinga .
My wife is scared.	Umfazi wam uyoyika.
But we will succeed.	Kodwa siya kuphumelela.
Good money.	Imali entle.
He knew he had to make a decision.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I'll take some things with us.	Ndiza kuthatha ezinye izinto kunye nathi.
But please.	Kodwa ndicela .
But there is everyone!	Kodwa kukho wonke umntu!
Otherwise, you can not.	Ngaphandle koko, awukwazi.
My mother said no.	Umama wathi hayi.
People say that you have succeeded.	Abantu bathi uphumelele.
Yes, almost nothing.	Ewe, phantse akukho nto.
And not the other way around.	Kwaye hayi ngenye indlela.
Not so much, but it would be great.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa kuya kuba kuhle.
Anything else .	Enye into .
There is a really big one out there.	Kukho enkulu ngokwenene phaya.
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nguye lowo.
He lived in it.	Wayehlala kuyo.
If you feel too strong about this.	Ukuba uziva ngamandla kakhulu ngale nto.
I wanted people.	Ndandifuna abantu.
I just go, you know.	Ndiya nje, uyazi.
You can't come to us right now.	Awunako ukuza kuthi okwangoku.
So, he wanted to meet.	Ngoko, wayefuna ukudibana.
There is someone else.	Kukho omnye umntu.
I knew all about him.	Ndandisazi konke ngaye.
I can't stay away.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude.
Or maybe years.	Okanye mhlawumbi iminyaka.
You know together.	Uyazi kunye.
You only do it once in the beginning.	Uyenza kube kanye kuphela ekuqaleni.
Now, enough talk.	Ngoku, ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
But now, here he is.	Kodwa ngoku, ulapha.
Or maybe they will come to us first.	Okanye mhlawumbi baya kuza kuthi kuqala.
They will be able to make a decision.	Baya kukwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
I don't know if people will live there.	Andazi ukuba abantu baya kuhlala apho.
That’s what he comes up with though.	Yiloo nto efika kuyo nangona kunjalo.
I want to be better.	Ndifuna ukuba ngcono.
Someone made a party.	Umntu wenze itheko.
I think he does that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayenza loo nto.
Here, in his prison.	Apha, entolongweni yakhe.
Yes, he will return.	Ewe, uya kubuya.
No problem for us.	Akukho ngxaki kuthi.
But he didn't really want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni ngokwenene.
It should have been his job.	Bekufanele ukuba ngumsebenzi wakhe.
Well, maybe anytime.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi nanini na.
And so it happened to me.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka kum.
Please tell me more.	Nceda undixelele ngakumbi.
You should not think of it any other way.	Akufanele ucinge ngayo ngenye indlela.
Yes, certainly, yes.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, ewe.
But that's only if you have time.	Kodwa oko kuphela ukuba unexesha.
You always have to think about it.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kufuneka ucinge ngayo.
So just.	Ngoko nje.
I just wanted to go home to him.	Bendifuna nje ukuya kuye ekhaya.
He won't do that.	Akayi kuyenza loo nto.
I can see everything.	Ndiyakwazi ukubona yonke into.
She works at school.	Usebenza esikolweni.
Not our way, of course.	Hayi indlela yethu, kunjalo.
He is here, too.	Ukhona apha, naye.
Traveling is not easy.	Ukuhamba akukho lula.
He decided to do it himself.	Wagqiba kwelokuba akwenze oko ngokwakhe.
And this is exactly what it is.	Kwaye yiloo nto kanye le nto.
We'll talk more later.	Siza kuthetha ngakumbi kamva.
It is not and it is not.	Akunjalo kwaye akunjalo.
But he will certainly do it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuyenza.
Or maybe both of us.	Okanye mhlawumbi sobabini.
Not at the time, of course.	Hayi ngelo xesha, kunjalo.
And he certainly doesn't know what to do with me.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akazi ukuba enze ntoni ngam.
I would like to be there.	Ndingathanda ukuba lapho.
No one spoke to her about it.	Akukho mntu wathetha naye ngalo nto.
I have never had that problem before.	Andizange ndibe naloo ngxaki ngaphambili.
This time he was not alone.	Ngeli xesha wayengekho yedwa.
He did not do well at home.	Akazange enze kakuhle ekhaya.
I want you to stay longer.	Ndifuna ukuba uhlale ixesha elide.
It can be a great person.	Inokuba ngumntu omkhulu.
Not so much, but it is.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa kunjalo.
No but, not that.	Hayi kodwa, hayi ukuba.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into.
He wanted to make a good picture.	Wayefuna ukwenza umfanekiso omhle.
I went to see a local doctor.	Ndaya kubona ugqirha wasekhaya.
Don't talk to me like that.	Musa ukuthetha nam ngolo hlobo.
But in the end he did just that.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wakwenza oko.
If you are lucky, there is only one.	Ukuba unethamsanqa, kukho enye kuphela.
I had to think of time.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ixesha.
I hope you feel the same way.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uziva njalo.
I know, now, why you spoke.	Ndiyazi, ngoku, kwakutheni ukuze uthethe.
So he did.	Ngoko wenza.
Two mistakes, really.	Iimpazamo ezimbini, ngokwenene.
And the police, of course.	Kwaye amapolisa, kunjalo.
So he would.	Ngoko wayeza.
Nice though to see.	Kuhle nangona kunjalo ukubona.
I am not at school.	Andikho esikolweni.
He can never do anything about it.	Akanakuze enze nto ngaloo nto.
It so happened that.	Oku kwenzeka ngoko ukuba.
This was not too difficult.	Oku akuzange kube nzima kakhulu.
But nobody was there.	Kodwa ke kwakungekho bani.
But he did not want to think about it.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukucinga ngaloo nto.
That did not happen that way.	Ayizange yenzeke loo ndlela.
You think you are reading these.	Ucinga ukuba ufunda ezi.
Her parents said no.	Abazali bakhe bathi hayi.
Not so at home.	Akunjalo ekhaya.
No, not your house.	Hayi, hayi indlu yakho.
Maybe you should look into it.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka ujonge kuyo.
And, you know, it would be great.	Kwaye, uyazi, kuya kuba kuhle.
I want to be sad.	Ndifuna ukuba buhlungu.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze isigqibo.
I feel that way.	Ndiziva njalo .
I can't talk enough about him.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngaye.
The problem there.	Ingxaki apho.
He has to stay.	Kufuneka ahlale.
That will be really fun.	Oko kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
It happened a lot recently.	Kwenzeka kakhulu mva nje.
But how to do that.	Kodwa ukwenza njani oko.
You will be able to do a lot at a time.	Uya kukwazi ukwenza okuninzi ngexesha.
She sits next to him on the bed.	Uhlala ecaleni kwakhe ebhedini.
And to him, too, and tomorrow.	Kwaye kuye, naye, kwaye ngomso.
I will definitely be !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuba!.
We do not have to.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba senze njalo.
I just sat there.	Ndihlale nje apho.
I think we all deserve it.	Ndicinga ukuba sonke sifanele.
Can not wait.	Ndikwazi kulinda.
He wanted to leave as soon as possible.	Wayefuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
So they will go a little further.	Ke ngoko baya kuhamba kancinci.
He will return that way.	Uya kubuya ngolo hlobo.
Everyone wanted to come to our house.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuza endlwini yethu.
Because he wanted to.	Kuba wayefuna.
It may be too far away.	Inokuba kude kakhulu.
No one ever suggested that to me.	Akukho mntu wakha wacebisa oko kum.
He has been away for two weeks.	Uhambe iiveki ezimbini.
She is really smart.	Ukrelekrele ngenene.
Not my own eyes, of course.	Hayi ngokwam amehlo, kunjalo.
It was not fun.	Kwakungekho mnandi.
But he has succeeded.	Kodwa uphumelele.
I didn’t, I thought this was going to happen.	Andizange, ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
There seems to be no problem.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho ngxaki.
Before it happened.	Ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke.
Maybe we need another way.	Mhlawumbi sifuna enye indlela.
I apologize for what happened before.	Ndicela uxolo ngento eyenzekileyo ngaphambili.
I'll be there with you, of course.	Ndiya kuba lapho nawe, kunjalo.
That always seems very special to me.	Oko kuhlala kubonakala kum kakhulu.
And then we'll talk some more.	Kwaye ke siza kuthetha ezinye ngakumbi.
But it goes.	Kodwa iya .
Otherwise they will do it again.	Ngaphandle koko baya kuyenza kwakhona.
So she did not tell anyone.	Ngoko akazange axelele mntu.
So, then, then.	Ngoko, ngoko, ngoko.
I knew better than to look away.	Ndandisazi ngcono kunokuba ndijonge kude.
Although there is nothing about that book.	Nangona akukho nto malunga naloo ncwadi.
I want to see my dad.	Ndifuna ukubona utata wam.
Really, everything.	Ngokwenene, yonke into.
It is not something you want to happen.	Asiyonto ofuna yenzeke.
One will stay with you for a long time.	Omnye uya kuhlala nawe ixesha elide.
That's right, that's right.	Kunjalo, kunjalo.
And, of course, nothing.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, akukho nto.
He doesn't want me to know where.	Akafuni ndiyazi apho.
I want to talk about that a little bit.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngaloo nto kancinci.
Only something is wrong.	Kuphela kukho into engalunganga.
He built nothing.	Akazange akhe nto.
He agreed to do so.	Wavuma ukwenjenjalo.
He thought more.	Wacinga ngakumbi.
I wonder what else could be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba yintoni enye into.
I don’t see anything in it or about it.	Andiboni nto kuyo okanye ngayo.
See you soon.	Ndiza kubona kungekudala.
He fell asleep, finally.	Walala, ekugqibeleni.
We did not know that until later.	Asizange siyazi loo nto de kube kamva.
There may be some truth to this.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kukho inyaniso kule nto.
She's definitely scared.	Uyoyika ngokuqinisekileyo.
Well, he didn't.	Ewe, akazange.
It would be nice to know.	Bekuya kuba kuhle ukwazi.
Yes, unless you want me to do so.	Ewe, ngaphandle kokuba ufuna ukuba ndenze njalo.
Just to stop.	Nje ukuba ayeke.
Now you will be able to do it.	Ngoku uya kukwazi ukuyenza.
And that is what happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka loo nto.
Not just coming.	Hayi nje ukuza.
Where is the father.	Uphi utata.
I wanted it to be that way.	Ndandifuna ukuba kube njalo.
But he said no.	Kodwa wathi hayi.
Or almost everything.	Okanye phantse yonke into.
Well, for now, he's fine.	Ewe, okwangoku, ulungile.
Not just, of course.	Akunjalo nje, kunjalo.
No, not at this time.	Hayi, hayi ngeli xesha.
I always want to.	Ndifuna rhoqo .
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba .
Finally, he joined me.	Ekugqibeleni, waba nam.
He decided to think of something else.	Wagqiba ekubeni acinge ngenye into.
You probably know what that is.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ukuba yintoni na leyo.
I will, soon.	Ndiza, kungekudala.
That's not my problem.	Hayi' ingxaki yam.
I also know that it will not be so.	Ndiyazi kwakhona ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
What should he do? 	Ufanele enze ntoni?
went the question.	wahamba umbuzo.
Sorry, though.	Uxolo, nangona kunjalo.
And outside.	Kwaye ngaphandle.
I'm glad to see that.	Ndiyavuya ukubona oko.
There are other people here, though.	Kukho abanye abantu apha, nangona kunjalo.
He knows his place.	Lowo uyayazi indawo yakhe.
And there are other things.	Kwaye kukho ezinye izinto.
Yes, he was.	Ewe wayesoyika.
I'm here, you are.	Ndilapha, ukhona.
In his room.	Egumbini lakhe.
And very, very much so.	Kwaye kakhulu, kakhulu.
Football, not really.	Ibhola, akunjalo.
It's his person.	Ngumntu wakhe.
But he also said no.	Kodwa naye wathi hayi.
He should not be alone.	Akufunekanga abe yedwa.
I think there is something there.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into apho.
And again tomorrow.	Kwaye kwakhona ngomso.
It would be sad if this could be something new.	Kuya kuba buhlungu ukuba le nto inokuba yinto entsha.
But he does not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba abe njalo.
It should be simple and easy to operate.	Kufuneka kube lula kwaye kube lula ukusebenza.
Down you should know better.	Phantsi kufuneka wazi ngcono.
Sure, if you want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ukuba uyafuna.
Then he said he was tired.	Emva koko wathi udiniwe.
Maybe you are human.	Mhlawumbi ungumntu.
He talks about you all the time.	Uthetha ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza kule nto.
And that's what you have to do.	Kwaye yinto ekufuneka uyenzile.
Dad loves her very much.	Utata uyamthanda kakhulu.
Very little by little.	Kakhulu kancinci kancinci.
It's really hard to say.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukuthetha.
You will have to think more.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngakumbi.
I have known all this for years.	Ndiyayazi yonke le nto iminyaka.
But you will get another chance.	Kodwa uya kufumana elinye ithuba.
And this just happens to be something else.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka nje ukuba enye into.
That's very good.	Kulungile kakhulu oko.
But they did not go very far away.	Kodwa abazange baye kude.
Someone who will do it.	Umntu oza kuyenza.
That’s my job and about it.	Yiloo nto umsebenzi wam kwaye malunga nayo.
I'll talk about that someday.	Ndiza kuthetha ngaloo nto ngenye imini.
It seems difficult.	Kubonakala kunzima.
I think he ran away.	Ndicinga ukuba wabaleka.
It is the same with him.	Kunjalo ke naye.
He is not here this afternoon.	Akakho apha ngale njikalanga.
Check out some of his books here.	Jonga ezinye iincwadi zakhe apha.
So he has to be a doctor.	Ngoko ke kufuneka abe ngugqirha.
Just out here.	Nje apha ngaphandle.
Her mother wanted to help others.	Umama wakhe wayefuna ukunceda abanye.
Do you feel better ?.	Uziva kakuhle?.
My mind is right.	Ingqondo yam ilungile.
Just two or three weeks.	Iiveki nje ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
It has had to be.	Kuye kwafuneka ukuba.
He did not want to be alone again.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa kwakhona.
For now it will be better.	Okwangoku kuya kuba ngcono.
As it never happened, or something.	Njengokuba akuzange kwenzeke, okanye into ethile.
Sorry for the coffee this morning.	Uxolo kakhulu ikofu ngale ntsasa.
But we know that there is life within him.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba kukho ubomi ngaphakathi kuye.
However it is not.	Nangona kunjalo akunjalo.
Your father again.	Utata wakho kwakhona.
It may be, but not always.	Inokuba njalo kodwa hayi rhoqo.
That would last a long time for him.	Oko bekuya kuhlala ixesha elide kuye.
You told me when you were right.	Undixelele xa ulungile.
This is probably not the case, though.	Oku mhlawumbi akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
In prison or outside, it will always be so.	Entolongweni okanye ngaphandle, kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
You know the house.	Uyayazi indlu.
Yes No.	Ewe, hayi.
I know how hard it is here.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani apha.
Yeah, that's just it.	Ewe, yile nto kuphela.
He was thinking only of his own career.	Wayecinga ngomsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
They'll know you're here.	Baza kukwazi ukuba ulapha.
I'd like to talk about that.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
He died himself.	Wafa ngokwakhe.
And not in a bad way.	Kwaye hayi ngendlela embi.
He didn't know where he was now.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi ngoku.
I look back later.	Ndijonge emva kwexesha .
Someone do it.	Umntu makayenze.
Or he was not.	Okanye wayengekho.
He went to college.	Waya ekholejini.
I think of you.	Ndiyacinga ngawe.
But not for us, really.	Kodwa hayi ngathi, ngokwenene.
And he did.	Kwaye wayenza.
But take a chance.	Kodwa ukuthatha ithuba.
But now maybe he doesn't want to.	Kodwa ngoku mhlawumbi akafuni.
I will wait for you.	Ndiza kulinda kuwe.
Or big.	Okanye enkulu.
And that's a very good thing, too.	Kwaye into entle kakhulu, nayo.
What will it be.	Kuya kuba yintoni na.
Will you?	Ngaba uya kwenza?
I know people will do it.	Ndiyazi ukuba abantu baya kuyenza.
He went to school a lot.	Waya esikolweni kakhulu.
Nobody wants to make a decision.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukwenza isigqibo.
My mother also could not find a house or a job.	Umama naye akazange akwazi ukufumana indlu okanye umsebenzi.
Do other people.	Ngaba abanye abantu.
But it's hard, to be here.	Kodwa kunzima, ukuba lapha.
But then he will appear.	Kodwa ke uya kubonakala.
We did this too.	Senze oku nathi.
You just know too many things.	Uyazi nje izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
Or maybe he just didn't think so.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayengacingi kwaphela.
One is.	Enye kukuba .
He just does it.	Uyayenza nje .
I saw an old, new one.	Ndabona endala, entsha.
He's just a man.	Ungumntu nje.
I look at the party.	Ndijonge epatini.
Look at this.	Jonga oku.
Maybe he's asleep.	Mhlawumbi ulele.
And that's a strange thing.	Kwaye yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
I think you should stay here.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uhlale apha.
I want my life back.	Ndifuna ubomi bam kwakhona.
Not just these books, but life.	Hayi nje ezi ncwadi, kodwa ubomi.
She loves to read, and does her homework.	Uthanda ukufunda, kwaye wenze umsebenzi wakhe wasekhaya.
You know, if anything happens.	Uyazi, ukuba kwenzeka nantoni na.
Me? 	Mna?
He is not like you.	Akakho njengawe.
I know there is nothing.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho nto.
I did something like that once.	Ndenza into enjalo kanye.
You talk about him all the time.	Uthetha ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha.
You are the reason.	Nguwe isizathu.
But this is not clearly the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
No one was coming.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuza.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela omnye andixelele ukuba yintoni le yam.
Later, he said that he probably knew.	Kamva, wathi mhlawumbi uyazi.
Probably possible.	Mhlawumbi kunokwenzeka.
And then he just sat there.	Kwaye ke wayehlala nje.
But do not do this.	Kodwa musa ukwenza oku.
He ran away from there.	Wabaleka wemka apho.
But he didn't want to think about it now.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukucinga ngaloo nto ngoku.
Going somewhere there.	Ukuya kwindawo ethile phaya.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Wonke umntu wayesazi kwaye akukho mntu wenza nto.
He told me where the money was.	Wandixelela ukuba iphi imali.
How do you feel about all this?	Uziva njani ngayo yonke lento?.
No, he did not.	Hayi, khange athethe.
It seems that this should not be so difficult.	Kubonakala ngathi oku akufuneki kube nzima kangako.
Why look further.	Kutheni ujonge ngakumbi.
I forgot about it.	Ndilibele ngayo.
Yes you can have a car.	Ewe unokuba nayo imoto.
That can be a very long time.	Oko kunokuba lixesha elide kakhulu.
But thank you again.	Kodwa enkosi kwakhona.
Low but not too high.	Phantsi kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He didn't think so, though.	Akazange acinge njalo, nangona kunjalo.
I want him to stop now.	Ndifuna ayeke ngoku.
Really nothing.	Ngokwenene akukho nto.
Yes you think well.	Ewe ucinga kakuhle.
Or you, with that.	Okanye wena, ngaloo nto.
I did not sit down.	Khange ndihlale phantsi.
I can make this happen.	Ndingayenza le nto yenzeke.
He did it again.	Uyenze kwakhona.
I want to find my mother.	Ndifuna ukufumana umama wam.
He approached me immediately and asked.	Weza kum kwangoko wandibuza.
Just really fast.	Ngokukhawuleza nje ngokwenene.
So he tried again.	Ngoko wazama kwakhona.
Yes, it will be difficult, but we will succeed.	Ewe, kuya kuba nzima, kodwa siya kuphumelela.
Look at your mother.	Jonga umama wakho.
But it is hard to make money.	Kodwa kunzima ukufumana imali.
Yes that's right.	Ewe kulungile.
He went to his car.	Waya emotweni yakhe.
Certainly now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngoku.
And now is a good time.	Kwaye ngoku lixesha elihle.
And there really is.	Kwaye ngokwenene kukho.
Maybe once more.	Mhlawumbi kube kanye kwakhona.
Finally, but for now.	Ekugqibeleni, kodwa okwangoku.
Being human is making mistakes.	Ukuba ngumntu kukwenza iimpazamo.
Just, right away.	Nje, ngoko nangoko.
You have to be.	Ufanele ukuba njalo.
So it seems that it could be true.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi inokuba yinyani.
I know it all.	Ndiyazi konke.
And by the way very quickly.	Kwaye ngendlela ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
This is certainly true.	Oku kunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
My mother did not come.	Akazange afike umama.
I'd like to meet him someday.	Ndingathanda ukudibana naye ngenye imini.
But it does not have to be repeated.	Kodwa akufuneki yenziwe kwakhona.
And it is up to you to decide.	Kwaye nguwe oza kuthatha isigqibo.
I don't want that to happen to you.	Andifuni yenzeke kuwe lonto.
I just want to do this myself, for now.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza oku ngokwam, okwangoku.
He knows where he went.	Uyazi apho waya khona.
But he would be one person.	Kodwa wayeza kuba ngumntu omnye.
That's what he wants me to know.	Yiloo nto afuna ndiyazi.
Obviously, that would have been much easier.	Ngokucacileyo, oko bekuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Eventually this ended.	Ekugqibeleni oku kuye kwaphela.
It's my time.	Lixesha lam.
This may not be possible soon, however.	Oku akunakwenzeka kungekudala, nangona kunjalo.
He wanted, obviously.	Wayefuna, ngokucacileyo.
You are lucky to have me as my friend.	Unethamsanqa lokuba ndibe ngumhlobo wam.
Not out here.	Akukho ngaphandle apha.
This means that he saw more or less.	Oku kuthetha ukuba wabona okuninzi okanye okuninzi.
You know, ahead of time.	Uyazi, ngaphambi kwexesha.
We've done this work before.	Senze lo msebenzi ngaphambili.
Then he moved on.	Emva koko waya phambili.
He knew he didn't.	Wayesazi ukuba akazange.
How so.	Njani ke .
how far.	kude kangakanani.
He did not lose his temper.	Akazange ayeke ukuzibamba.
He never did that again.	Akazange aphinde ayenze loo nto.
We have done a lot with it.	Senze kakhulu ngayo.
But then one day something terrible happened.	Kodwa ngenye imini kwenzeka into embi.
But you will have to wait.	Kodwa kuya kufuneka ulinde.
But better travel.	Kodwa ukuhamba ngcono.
You're tired, you're tired.	Udiniwe, udiniwe.
This is exactly what happened to us.	Yile nto kanye eyenzekayo kuthi.
He walked fast.	Wahamba ngamandla.
You learn a lot.	Ufunda okuninzi.
I had to think about it.	Bekufanele ndicinge ngayo.
It will be a little bit.	Kuya kuba kancinci.
He may be alone for the rest of his life.	Usenokuba yedwa ubomi bakhe bonke.
Why did he do this?	Kwakutheni ukuze enze le nto.
If you want to do this, you will do it.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza oku, uya kukwenza.
Yes, it should.	Ewe bekufanele kube njalo.
But really, no.	Kodwa ngokwenene, hayi.
I don't know, myself.	Andazi, ngokwam.
He spoke well of you.	Uthethe kakuhle ngawe.
I thought you were leaving a long time ago.	Bendicinga uhamba kudala.
I wish he did, just once.	Ndinqwenela ukuba enze njalo, kube kanye nje.
He said he was right about it.	Wathi ulungile ngayo.
I want to do it tonight.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
My mother did the same.	Umama wenza njalo naye.
And it can be today.	Kwaye kunokuba njalo namhlanje.
But we will not stay.	Kodwa asiyi kuhlala.
You will start at this time.	Uya kuqala ngeli xesha.
It would be a child.	Bekuya kuba ngumntwana.
Well, now it is.	Ewe, ngoku kunjalo.
I totally apologize for that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokupheleleyo ngaloo nto.
Nothing to take.	Akukho nto ukuthatha.
There really is no time.	Ngokwenene akukho xesha.
He should be here by now.	Bekufanele ukuba sele elapha ngoku.
He's just like him.	Ufana naye nje.
Not here, not now, not like this.	Hayi apha, hayi ngoku, hayi ngolu hlobo.
But in a good way.	Kodwa ngendlela entle.
It's just a person.	Ngumntu nje.
Too much room.	Igumbi elininzi kakhulu.
It happened for a long time.	Kwenzeka ixesha elide.
That can only be a good thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle kuphela.
One way is this.	Enye indlela yile.
That is my speech.	Nantso ke intetho yam.
He thought he was going to do a great job.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
I don't see it, though.	Andiboni, nangona kunjalo.
My path is right.	Indlela yam ilungile.
You just have to go with it.	Kufuneka uhambe nayo nje.
Really, I hope, I hope.	Ngenene, ndiyathemba, ndiyathemba.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ilungile.
He didn't want to think about anything.	Wayengafuni ukucinga ngayo nayiphi na into.
I want to do everything with you.	Ndifuna ukwenza yonke into nawe.
Or it seems to us.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi.
This did not happen, however.	Oku akuzange kube njalo, nangona kunjalo.
He has.	Ukhe waba .
He's always talking about something.	Usoloko ethetha ngento ethile.
Well this happened.	Kulungile oku kwenzeke.
You know, like before.	Uyazi, njengakuqala.
I didn't know what to do about it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto.
It is very difficult to talk to him.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha naye.
But you will do it.	Kodwa ke uya kuyenza.
You need to be able to learn music.	Kufuneka ukwazi ukufunda umculo.
I know you think a lot about yourself.	Ndiyazi ukuba ucinga kakhulu ngawe.
That can happen here.	Oko kunokwenzeka apha.
We've done that for a very long time.	Senze loo nto ixesha elide kakhulu.
You will see that it is so.	Uya kubona ukuba kunjalo.
Some probably never will.	Abanye mhlawumbi soze.
You do not have to stay.	Akufunekanga uhlale.
Impossible to see.	Akunakwenzeka ukubona.
He is the one without her.	Nguye ngaphandle kwakhe.
I don't want this to be my job.	Andifuni ukuba ngumsebenzi wam lo.
The answer is probably not.	Impendulo mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did not say time.	Akazange athethe ixesha.
I do not believe this is so.	Andikholelwa ukuba oku kunjalo.
I'm sorry about what happened.	Ndiyaxolisa ngento eyenzekayo.
I would like to know how I did this.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
He just doesn't know how.	Akayazi nje ukuba njani.
And you read very well.	Kwaye ufunda kakuhle kakhulu.
He went out for a long time.	Waphuma ixesha elide.
Tomorrow will be you.	Ngomso iya kuba nguwe.
But that was not difficult.	Kodwa oko akuzange kube nzima.
I will need your help.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo lwakho.
I'm not sure anymore.	Andiqinisekanga kwakhona.
That’s why staying so good.	Yiyo loo nto ukuhlala kuhle kakhulu.
She, too, eats breakfast early.	Naye, utya isidlo sakusasa kwangethuba.
Even one question.	Nokuba umbuzo omnye.
I can't imagine this.	Andikwazi ukucinga oku.
Just as quickly.	Kanye ngokukhawuleza.
It's just hard to find.	Kunzima nje ukufumana.
It would have to be.	Bekuya kufuneka .
I was unable to come to college last week.	Andikwazanga ukuza ekholejini kwiveki ephelileyo.
It's in everything.	Kukho kuyo yonke into.
Almost everyone loves her.	Phantse wonke umntu uyamthanda.
If you have time to do so.	Ukuba unexesha lokwenza njalo.
And my voice.	Kwaye ilizwi lam.
But there is something wrong with it.	Kodwa kukho into engalunganga ngayo.
If you like something like that, fine.	Ukuba uthanda into enjalo, kulungile.
I try to come home for dinner.	Ndizama ukuza ekhaya ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
He did not want to go out.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma.
Tell me the truth now.	Ndixelele inyani ngoku.
I live alone here.	Ndihlala ndedwa apha.
That is exactly what is happening today.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo namhlanje.
Everyone left.	Wonke umntu wemka.
I'd like to play ball or something.	Ndingathanda ukudlala ibhola okanye into.
I really wanted to talk to you.	Bendifuna kakhulu ukuthetha nawe.
I didn't want anything to do with him.	Ndandingafuni kwanto yakhe.
Do not pretend you do not know.	Musa ukwenza ngathi ubungazi.
I'll buy it.	Ndiza kuthenga.
He wanted something done and done now.	Wayefuna into yenziwe kwaye yenziwe ngoku.
Really, very bad.	Ngokwenene, embi kakhulu.
Yes cat.	Ewe ikati.
I didn’t know that then, but after that.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ngoko, kodwa emva koko.
Sorry, of course.	Uxolo, kunjalo.
It can be really good.	Inokuba kuhle ngokwenene.
Yes, but doctor, the doctor has to do that.	Ewe, kodwa ugqirha, ugqirha kufuneka enze oko.
He just can't do it.	Akanakuyenza nje loo nto.
And so it is again.	Kwaye unjalo kwakhona.
We'll just talk about it.	Siza kuthetha nje ngathi.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha.
There is a good dog.	Kukho inja elungileyo.
I would like to read more about this.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngakumbi oku.
That’s what it seems like to me.	Yiloo nto ebonakala ngathi, kum.
You are always interested.	Uhlala unomdla.
He cannot read.	Akakwazi ukufunda.
I think hard.	Ndicinga nzima.
Very good here.	Kuhle kakhulu apha.
We will do it there.	Siza kuyenza apho.
Maybe we didn't go.	Mhlawumbi asizange sihambe.
I never did this again.	Khange ndiphinde ndiyenze lento.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje, mhlawumbi hayi ngomso, kodwa kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
And it can be very simple.	Kwaye kunokuba lula kakhulu.
I like that, by the way.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto, ngendlela.
But there are many more.	Kodwa kukho ezinye ezininzi.
The woman also sat down.	Naye wahlala phantsi umfazi.
But he can't think.	Kodwa akakwazi ukucinga.
He knew everything about her.	Wayesazi yonke into ngaye.
It's too small for me.	Yinto encinci kakhulu kum.
He had to stay.	Kwafuneka ahlale.
I want life.	Ndifuna ubomi.
What we need to know is that.	Into ekufuneka siyazi ukuba apho.
The book never happened.	Incwadi ayizange yenzeke.
He asked why he was coming alone.	Wabuza ukuba kutheni eze yedwa.
Finding a job is difficult.	Ukufumana umsebenzi kunzima.
Back there, of course.	Emva phaya, kunjalo.
I do it very often.	Ndiyenza rhoqo kakhulu.
In the evening on it.	Ngokuhlwa kuyo.
For all our work.	Ngomsebenzi wethu wonke.
He died a month later.	Wafa kwinyanga emva koko.
Something wrong to say.	Into engalunganga ukuyithetha.
It is clear now, of course.	Kucacile ngoku, kunjalo.
But this is not the only place where this has happened.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo kuphela indawo apho oku kwenzeka khona.
Now he stays with me all the time.	Ngoku uhleli nam ngalo lonke ixesha.
But he did not sit down.	Kodwa akazange ahlale phantsi.
He knew everything about her.	Wayesazi konke ngaye.
Not today, but soon.	Hayi namhlanje, kodwa kungekudala.
He does it.	Uyayenza .
I'm not sure you really want to be there.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ufuna ngokwenene ukuba lapho.
Obviously, everyone does.	Ngokucacileyo, wonke umntu uyayenza.
Just a sudden death.	Ukufa nje ngokukhawuleza.
All.	Yonke .
That's very fine.	Ilungile kakhulu loo nto.
I just don’t understand what the problem might be.	Andiqondi nje ukuba inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
We want to make you a player.	Sifuna ukwenza ukuba ube ngumdlali.
And you will be.	Kwaye uya kuba .
You can't have everyone looking the same.	Awukwazi ukuba wonke umntu ujonge ngendlela efanayo.
You never told me why.	Awuzange undixelele ukuba kutheni.
This can be.	Oku kunokuba .
I never told her about it, of course.	Andizange ndimxelele ngayo, kunjalo.
I have completely forgotten that until now.	Ndilibele tu ukuba kude kube ngoku.
Just another house.	Enye nje indlu.
It will probably not be easy to get that far.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba lula ukuya kude kangako.
She's trying to get better.	Uzama ukuba ngcono.
I mean, anyone.	Ndithetha, nabani na.
I too did not succeed.	Nam andikwazanga ukuphumelela.
All your fault.	Impazamo yakho yonke.
Maybe you are lucky.	Mhlawumbi unethamsanqa.
So again, thank you.	Ngoko kwakhona, enkosi.
This, he opened.	Oku, wavula.
Not at home.	Hayi ekhaya.
The mind is really real.	Ingqondo ngokwenene ngokwenene.
I have nothing else.	Andinayo enye into.
I want money very, very much.	Ndifuna imali kakhulu, kakhulu.
He never stopped singing.	Akazange ayeke ukucula.
I never looked forward so much.	Andizange ndijonge phambili kangako.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza oko.
All of this the doctor needs to know.	Konke oku kufuneka ugqirha akwazi.
The woman is always wrong.	Umfazi uhlala engalunganga.
Three days in it.	Iintsuku ezintathu kuyo.
He does not want or need any more money.	Akafuni okanye akafuni enye imali.
And that will be all this evening.	Kwaye oko kuya kuba yiyo yonke le ngokuhlwa.
He really did that.	Uyenzile loo nto ngenene.
She told me herself.	Undixelele ngokwakhe.
I have lived here for a long time.	Kudala ndihlala apha.
Maybe in front of you.	Mhlawumbi phambi kwakho.
Seeing my parents.	Ukubona abazali bam.
He is even more confident in his power.	Uqinisekile ngakumbi ngamandla akhe.
I never really thought too much.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngokwenene.
You probably can’t do it all at once, though.	Mhlawumbi awukwazi ukuyenza ngexesha elinye, nangona kunjalo.
No more !.	Hayi kwakhona !.
It's good for you.	Kulungile kuwe.
Just food.	Ukutya nje kuphela.
Stop searching too much.	Yeka ukucinga kakhulu.
Or you can do this.	Okanye ungayenza le nto .
Done yesterday.	Yenziwe izolo.
You've done this before.	Ukhe wenza ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
This is a good thing for almost everyone.	Le yinto entle phantse wonke umntu.
I didn't want any money at all.	Ndandingafuni mali kwaphela.
He looked at anything but.	Wajonga nantoni na kodwa.
Try that now.	Ukuzama oko ngoku.
He saw something there.	Wabona into apho.
And maybe this is a good thing.	Kwaye mhlawumbi le yinto elungileyo.
And besides, he goes with us.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, uhamba nathi.
And if so, how do you go about it?	Kwaye ukuba kunjalo, uhamba njani ngayo?
But, again, he just got angry.	Kodwa, kwakhona, waba nomsindo kuphela.
There was not much here for him.	Kwakungekho nto ingako apha kuye.
Not just talking.	Hayi nje ukuthetha.
I can't do everything alone.	Andikwazi ukwenza yonke into ndedwa.
I told you the truth about that.	Ndikuxelele inyani ngalonto.
I do not remember well.	Andikhumbuli kakuhle.
I don't know how much he ended up with.	Andazi ukuba wagqiba malini.
Her three children.	Abantwana bakhe abathathu.
What could it be? 	Inokuba yintoni?
I want you.	Ndifuna wena.
I would like to go in the morning.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba kusasa.
This is really.	Oku ngokwenene.
So it can be very painful.	Ngoko inokuba buhlungu.
I think of him.	Ndiyacinga ngaye.
I always knew.	Bendisoloko ndikwazi.
He said he could read.	Wathi uyakwazi ukufunda.
I think that is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
So, now.	Ngoko, ngoku.
But no no no.	Kodwa hayi hayi hayi.
And food, obviously.	Kwaye ukutya, ngokucacileyo.
I'll tell her to go with you.	Ndiza kumxelela ukuba ahambe nawe.
But yes, great work.	Kodwa ewe, umsebenzi omkhulu.
All at once together.	Konke ngexesha kunye.
There is no time now.	Akukho xesha ngoku.
No one has ever found such a thing.	Akukho mntu wakha wafumana into enje.
This one took a few weeks.	Lo wathatha iiveki ezimbalwa.
You feel good, you play well.	Uziva ulungile, udlala kakuhle.
Very nice picture.	Umfanekiso omhle kakhulu.
Or think so.	Okanye ucinge njalo.
But look here.	Kodwa jonga apha.
If you feel like it.	Ukuba uziva ufuna.
That and the kids.	Oko kunye nabantwana.
He really came down.	Wehla nyani.
You definitely want a car to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna imoto ukuhamba.
Or dad.	Okanye utata.
But he asked if it was all right.	Kodwa wabuza ukuba kulungile na.
Yeah, not a bit.	Ewe, hayi kancinci.
Not entirely at first.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo ekuqaleni.
I got here last week.	Ndifike apha kwiveki ephelileyo.
You are right to do so.	Ulungile ukwenjenjalo.
You do not go to work in the morning.	Awuyi emsebenzini ekuseni.
It happens to all of us.	Kwenzeka kuthi sonke.
Not always, but enough.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
He did nothing to her.	Akenzanga nto kuye.
There is somebody up there.	Kukho umntu phaya phezulu.
So why.	Ngoko kutheni .
He will speak.	Uza kuthetha.
He too looked up.	Naye wajonga phezulu.
Or let me do it.	Okanye mandiyenze.
She loves it there.	Uyayithanda apho.
There seems to be no buying.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho kuthenga.
You love one of us, you love the other.	Uthanda omnye wethu, uthanda omnye.
I'm so glad it did.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba kube njalo.
I have never told anyone that before.	Zange ndixelele mntu oko ngaphambili.
This is too old.	Mdala kakhulu le.
I want things for myself.	Ndifuna izinto ngokwam.
I think we did very well.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle kakhulu.
But, please.	Kodwa, nceda.
I want to see what's going on.	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni na.
But, come down here.	Kodwa, uze apha phantsi.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka ncam.
Really, don't think.	Ngokwenene, musa ukucinga.
You always want to come here.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ungathanda ukuza apha.
We will need your help to make it so.	Siza kufuna uncedo lwakho ukuze sibe njalo.
You may not.	Usenokuba hayi.
So he must have thought that he needed to know.	Ngoko umele ukuba wayecinga ukuba kufuneka azi.
Now to do this.	Ngoku ukwenza le nto.
It consumes time.	Kutya ixesha.
without you.	ngaphandle kwakho.
He did wrong.	Wenza engalunganga.
He took his time, and did not drive.	Wathatha ixesha lakhe, kwaye akazange aqhube.
And that's a good thing for him.	Kwaye yinto entle kuye.
But what is this.	Kodwa yintoni le.
It could be better.	Kunokuba ngcono.
And my money.	Kwaye imali yam.
And then it comes to me.	Kwaye emva koko kuza kum.
And now we know exactly where this other place is.	Kwaye ngoku siyazi ukuba iphi kanye kanye le enye indawo.
I can't be here all day.	Andikwazi ukuba lapha imini yonke.
This can be difficult and difficult quickly.	Oku kunokuba nzima kwaye kunzima ngokukhawuleza.
You can't make a mistake.	Awunako ukwenza impazamo.
I have always wanted to go there.	Kudala ndifuna ukuya apho.
I'll take a chance.	Ndiza kuthatha ithuba.
But he came alone.	Kodwa weza yedwa.
He looked back at the bedroom.	Wajonga emva egumbini lokulala.
I don't care about all that.	Andikhathali ngayo yonke loo nto.
He just says whatever he wants.	Uthetha nje nantoni na ayifunayo.
I'm sure it will be very fun.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
Nobody came this way.	Akukho mntu uze ngale ndlela.
I mean man.	Ndithetha umntu.
Now he spoke.	Ngoku wathetha.
With my money.	Ngemali yam.
Today almost no one.	Namhlanje phantse akukho namnye.
I know my man.	Ndiyamazi umntu wam.
He hoped he knew better.	Wayenethemba lokuba uyazi ngcono.
But then again, not really.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, akunjalo.
He would love to see this.	Angathanda ukubona oku.
I will be coming soon.	Ndiza kuza kungekudala.
You can be there.	Unokuba lapho.
He will be alone there.	Uzakuba yedwa phaya.
I'm glad this happened.	Ndiyavuya ukuba kwenzeke oku.
I do not know where they live.	Andazi ukuba bahlala phi.
That goes really well.	Oko kuhamba kakuhle ngenene.
It could be anyone, he thought.	Inokuba ngubani, wacinga.
He said he did not, but it is possible.	Wathi akazange, kodwa kusenokwenzeka.
I know how this will end, you think.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kuya kuphela njani, ucinga.
He would tell her that he loved her.	Wayeza kumxelela ukuba uyamthanda.
This is not far.	Akukho kude le.
One down, three to.	Omnye phantsi, abathathu ukuya.
Because my mother does, every night.	Kuba umama wenza njalo, rhoqo ebusuku.
It almost means it is ready.	Phantse kuthetha ukuba sele ilungile.
Today and every day from now on.	Namhlanje kwaye yonke imihla ukusukela ngoku ukuya phambili.
You can do it.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza.
My son needs to eat.	Unyana wam kufuneka atye.
Inside, of course.	Ngaphakathi, kunjalo.
He did not know how long it would take.	Wayengazi ukuba kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
They live in a car.	Bahlala emotweni.
Bad thing, bad thing.	Into embi, into embi.
The police did the same.	Amapolisa enjenjalo.
He could not.	Akanakukwazi.
I did it today.	Ndenze namhlanje.
Will you do so? 	Ngaba uza kwenza njalo?
He was not too hard to get into bed.	Akazange abe nzima kakhulu ukuba angene ebhedini.
First of all.	Oko kuqala.
I too am a man.	Nam ndingumntu.
There is that thing out there.	Kukho loo nto ngaphandle.
I just don’t know how I did this.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani oku.
Not at night, of course.	Hayi ebusuku, kunjalo.
Just for dinner.	Ngesidlo sangokuhlwa nje.
Tomorrow it will be more visible.	Ngomso kuya kubonakala ngakumbi.
You just have to be yourself, be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe, ube nguwe.
But someone gave me another shirt.	Kodwa umntu wandinika enye ihempe.
Although the work is good.	Nangona umsebenzi ulungile.
You already have it.	Sele unayo.
So I apologize.	Ngoko ndicela uxolo.
We know everything.	Siyazi konke.
He speaks quickly.	Uthetha ngokukhawuleza.
Which is smaller.	Yeyiphi encinci.
It's better for you.	Kungcono kuwe.
I do not believe it either.	Nam andikholelwa.
He only stayed a week.	Wahlala iveki kuphela.
This is his place.	Le ndawo yakhe.
He is lying right next to me.	Ulele kanye ecaleni kwam.
He also asked why.	Naye wabuza ukuba kutheni.
And it's you.	Kwaye nguwe.
And it's not hard to see why.	Kwaye akukho nzima ukubona ukuba kutheni.
Money comes your way.	Imali iza ngendlela yakho.
He got there.	Wafika apho.
You are right for him.	Ulungile kuye.
It's better to go.	Kungcono ukuhamba.
I will do anything to be with you.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na ukuze ndibe nawe.
You have everything here.	Unayo yonke into apha.
I don't want anyone to think that about me.	Andifuni mntu ucinga lonto ngam.
And, yet, not much will happen inside.	Kwaye, nangona kunjalo, akukho nto ingako iya kwenzeka ngaphakathi.
You may be.	Usenokuba.
We will wait for you.	Siza kulinda wena.
He hasn't done much, though.	Akukho nto ingako ayenzileyo, nangona kunjalo.
He did not know for how long.	Wayengazi ukuba ixesha elide kangakanani na.
I would like you to think about it.	Ndingathanda ukuba ucinge ngaloo nto.
This is not mandatory.	Oku akunyanzelekanga.
Please look at the picture.	Nceda ujonge umfanekiso.
Do not make friends.	Musa ukwenza abahlobo.
It would be painful to get out.	Bekuya kuba buhlungu ukuphuma.
Or, this morning.	Okanye, ngale ntsasa.
I think you like this.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda le nto.
However, there is a way to do it.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho indlela yokwenza.
Yes, this can be good.	Ewe, oku kunokuba kuhle.
I think you have it too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe unayo.
I want you to go with me.	Ndifuna uhambe nam.
Being you is something new now.	Ukuba nguwe yinto entsha ngoku.
He came after her.	Uze emva kwakhe.
I think it's powerful.	Ndicinga ukuba ngamandla.
This is not what you want to do.	Ayisiyiyo le nto ufuna ukuyenza.
Being him again.	Ukuba nguye kwakhona.
He did that, exactly.	Wayenza loo nto, kanye.
We will not be able to do it.	Asiyi kukwazi ukuyenza.
She feels good.	Uziva kakuhle.
There is a cat, too.	Kukho ikati, nayo.
I have done it now.	Ndiyenzile ngoku.
And he can't walk.	Kwaye akakwazi ukuhamba.
I want you to know that I am.	Ndifuna wazi ukuba ndim.
I will make coffee.	Ndiza kwenza ikofu.
I've been waiting for you my whole life.	Ndilinde wena ubomi bam bonke.
This, however, he says, is impossible.	Oku nangona kunjalo, uthi, akunakwenzeka.
He did not enter the house.	Akazange angene endlwini.
I'm tired of being alone.	Ndidiniwe kukuba ndedwa.
You are looking at the phone.	Ujonge ifowuni.
Thank you for your excellent work.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi omhle.
However, perhaps it is not.	Kodwa ke, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It seems like something new.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto entsha.
He never became an actor.	Akazange abe ngumdlali.
Then again.	Emva koko kwakhona .
And that makes the decision difficult.	Ke oko kwenza ukugqiba kube nzima.
One week to go there.	Iveki enye ukuya khona.
You want to meet.	Ufuna ukudibana.
But not your mother.	Kodwa hayi umama wakho.
You want to be that way, all right.	Ufuna ukuba njalo, kulungile.
But that will happen.	Kodwa oko kuya kwenzeka.
His main thing is that he wants to succeed.	Into yakhe enkulu kukuba ufuna ukuphumelela.
Please be with us so we can be.	Nceda ube nathi ukuze sibe njalo.
Maybe I thought he was coming with us.	Inokuba ndandicinga ukuba uza kunye nathi.
There must have been no place at all.	Inokuba kwakungekho ndawo konke konke.
How would he do it.	Wayeza kwenza njani .
I make good money.	Ndenza imali entle.
But he will do the best he can.	Kodwa uya kwenza into engcono kakhulu.
And by doing so with the kids.	Kwaye ngokwenza njalo nabantwana.
His work has made that easy.	Umsebenzi wakhe wenze ukuba kube lula oko.
But you have to go now.	Kodwa kufuneka uhambe ngoku.
He looked slightly.	Wajonga kancinci.
Play very fast.	Ukudlala ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I've been talking about it for a long time.	Kudala ndithetha ngayo.
You may have heard about it before.	Usenokuba ukhe weva ngayo ngaphambili.
So look at that.	Ngoko jonga oko.
That's the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela.
And it wasn't there.	Kwaye kwakungekho apho.
You probably do too.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba nawe unjalo.
All the children go to school.	Bonke abantwana baya esikolweni.
It could be.	Inokuba yiyo.
Or he thought it was necessary.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba kufuneka.
I'm scared.	Ndiyoyika mna.
He died.	Wafa .
And that is not possible at the moment.	Kwaye akunakwenzeka okwangoku.
There is, moreover, another problem.	Kukho, ngaphezu koko, enye ingxaki.
My son knows that.	Unyana wam uyayazi lonto.
But in order for anything to happen, one has to learn.	Kodwa ukuze kwenzeke nantoni na, umntu kufuneka afunde.
So, there it is.	Ngoko, kukho loo nto.
Tell me something about it.	Ndixelele into ngaloo nto.
I said nothing to her.	Andizange ndithethe nto kuye.
He would have to try.	Bekuya kufuneka azame.
Maybe he said it was good enough.	Mhlawumbi wathi ilungile ngokwaneleyo.
And now, with this.	Kwaye ngoku, ngale nto.
Yes this is possible.	Ewe oku kunokwenzeka.
Then tomorrow.	Kusasa ke.
Or it could be the same thing.	Okanye inokuba yinto enye.
Well, that's done.	Kulungile, yenziwe loo nto.
This can be fun, too.	Oku kunokuba mnandi, kwakhona.
To see.	Ukubona.
And there are many other things.	Kwaye kukho ezinye izinto ezininzi.
I have to be alone.	Kufuneka ndibe ndedwa.
But some did not, say.	Kodwa abanye abazange, bathi.
I wanted to do something that would make money.	Ndandifuna ukwenza into eza kwenza imali.
Not many things, but some things.	Hayi izinto ezininzi, kodwa ezinye izinto.
You are the reason we do this.	Nguwe isizathu sokuba senze oku.
But it will continue.	Kodwa iya kuqhubeka.
If you did, that's fine.	Ukuba uyenzile, kulungile.
And you will have it, you will always have it.	Kwaye uya kuba nayo, uya kuhlala unayo.
I'm sure you won.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uphumelele.
You feel very good.	Uziva ulungile kakhulu.
That's a long time now.	Lixesha elide elo ngoku.
And it always is.	Kwaye kuhlala kunjalo.
And you will say no, it is not.	Kwaye uya kuthi hayi, akunjalo.
Nice to see your place.	Ndiyavuya ukubona indawo yakho.
To be a good man.	Ukuba yindoda elungileyo.
There was no need to make fresh coffee.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokwenza ikofu entsha.
He did a good job.	Wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
I would love to do that again soon.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko kwakhona kungekudala.
But, thank you two.	Kodwa, enkosi ezimbini.
People sit down.	Abantu bahlala phantsi.
Do you know .	Ingaba uyazi .
He can't stop.	Akakwazi ukuyeka.
He will come alone.	Uya kuza yedwa.
However, it all happens at the same time.	Nangona kunjalo, konke kwenzeka ngexesha elinye.
I saw a doctor.	Ndabona ugqirha.
Someone good did.	Omnye umntu olungileyo wenza.
And more self-control.	Kwaye ngakumbi ukuzibamba.
And forward again.	Kwaye phambili kwakhona.
I feel tired of all that.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe yiyo yonke loo nto.
I know he has to think everyone is asleep.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka acinge ukuba wonke umntu ulele.
So without me, you would be fine.	Ngoko ngaphandle kwam, uya kuba ulungile.
Dad died soon afterward.	UTata wafa kungekudala emva koko.
Now, he clearly did not appear.	Ngoku, ngokucacileyo akazange abonakale.
That means only one thing.	Oko kuthetha into enye kuphela.
Now in it.	Ngoku kuyo.
Her mother is tired.	Umama wakhe udiniwe.
I love it that way though.	Ndiyayithanda ngolo hlobo kodwa.
So, buy some time.	Ngoko, uthenge ixesha.
And he did.	Kwaye wenza.
But it was nothing, nothing.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto, akukho nto.
There really is no reason.	Ngokwenene akukho sizathu.
He is sleeping today.	Ulele namhlanje.
He won't talk about her.	Akayi kuthetha ngaye.
Isn't it?	Ngaba akunjalo.
Now is good.	Ngoku kulungile.
That we do not have to decide.	Oko akuyomfuneko ukuba senze isigqibo.
Certainly, it will be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba njalo.
I think that's all.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo yonke into.
This means that your money is moving forward.	Oku kuthetha ukuba imali yakho iya phambili.
I know it will be hard for me.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kum.
It shouldn't.	Akufanele.
I think you want the truth.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna inyaniso.
And yes.	Kwaye ewe.
He stayed for three days.	Wahlala iintsuku ezintathu.
But nobody wants that.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna loo nto.
Being in a new place, alone.	Ukuba kwindawo entsha, ndedwa.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
But that's the way.	Kodwa nantso indlela.
I didn't have any money to do that.	Andizange ndibe nayo nayiphi na imali yokwenza oko.
Check this out!.	Jonga le!.
You eat a lot, that's why.	Utya kakhulu, yiyo loo nto.
Thanks, but not for me.	Enkosi, kodwa hayi kum.
But you have to talk to me.	Kodwa kufuneka uthethe nam.
I always thought it was him, or about him.	Ndihlala ndicinga ukuba nguye, okanye ngaye.
All right now, all right.	Kulungile ngoku, kulungile.
But still nothing.	Kodwa nangoku akukho nto.
And she's sitting there today.	Kwaye uhleli phaya namhlanje.
Obviously there is something wrong with it lately.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into engalunganga ngayo mva nje.
Which means you have to arrive early.	Into ethetha ukuba kufuneka ufike kwangethuba.
Little by little here in my house.	Kancinci kancinci apha endlini yam.
Others, however, will.	Abanye, nangona kunjalo, baya kwenza.
She has made too much food.	Wenze ukutya okuninzi kakhulu.
Everything is better for him, then.	Konke kungcono kuye, ke.
Obviously, this can be difficult.	Ngokucacileyo, oku kunokuba nzima.
No, it can be fun.	Hayi, inokuba mnandi.
You must have gotten into him.	Umele ukuba uye wangena kuye.
It will find errors.	Iya kufumana iimpazamo.
No, certainly not soon.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kungekudala.
We did not go to the party last night.	Khange siye epatini phezolo.
But he seems a little out of place.	Kodwa ubonakala kancinci.
I know now that he is not thinking at all.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba akacingi tu.
He thought nothing of it.	Wayengacingi kwanto.
But no exception.	Kodwa akukho ngaphandle.
And that, of course, is good for me.	Kwaye oko, kunjalo, kulungile kum.
I'm even more scared of my cat.	Ndiyoyika ngakumbi ikati yam.
He finally said he would.	Ekugqibeleni wathi uza kwenza njalo.
But he loves to play.	Kodwa uyathanda ukudlala.
He also stays a few days.	Naye ke uhlala iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Everything is fine.	Konke kuhle.
It's not like you're sitting alone.	Hayi ngathi uhleli yedwa.
Yes, that would be great.	Ewe, bekuya kuba kuhle.
But he must succeed.	Kodwa kufuneka aphumelele.
I wanted to work with him.	Ndandifuna ukusebenza naye.
Curious, he thought.	Unomdla, wacinga.
I wish it happened regularly.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kwenzeke rhoqo.
You can't do anything you want to do here.	Awunako ukwenza nantoni na ofuna ukuyenza apha.
Yeah, it's hard for me.	Ewe, kunzima kum.
It's a small thing, nothing.	Yinto encinci, akukho nto.
One in prison.	Omnye entolongweni.
About that, of course.	Malunga naloo nto, kunjalo.
It will be at that time again.	Iza kuba ngelo xesha kwakhona.
He sat inside her.	Wahlala ngaphakathi kwakhe.
You're not going.	Awuyi.
Or a phone.	Okanye ifowuni.
I need someone else.	Ndifuna omnye umntu.
They seldom stay in one place for long.	Akafane ahlale kwindawo enye ixesha elide.
Some say yes.	Abanye bathi ewe.
One is the old one.	Enye yile endala.
He does not want to eat anything, alone.	Akafuni kutya nto, yedwa.
There is not much money.	Akukho mali ingako.
He decided to go home.	Wagqiba kwelokuba agoduke.
You just read.	Ufunda nje.
Your job, your name.	Umsebenzi wakho, igama lakho.
I need time alone to think.	Ndifuna ixesha ndedwa ukucinga.
I just want you to know one thing.	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi into enye.
I will go this way.	Ndiza kuhamba ngale ndlela.
I'm not sure what you want.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ufuna ntoni.
And, it's not easy.	Kwaye, akukho lula.
However, this is really possible.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
But now it looked like he was.	Kodwa ngoku kwakubonakala ngathi nguye.
But no one has ever done this before.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakha wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
So much for getting a gun.	Kakhulu ukufumana umpu.
But it could be anything.	Kodwa inokuba nantoni na.
And she is, every day.	Kwaye unjalo, yonke imihla.
But this is not as easy as it seems.	Kodwa oku akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
I wonder how long this will last, though.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba oku kuya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani, nangona kunjalo.
You learn immediately and regularly.	Ufunda kwangoko kwaye rhoqo.
Then he looked up.	Emva koko wajonga.
And suddenly, really.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza, ngokwenene.
I want me and him all.	Ndifuna mna naye wonke.
Or going to school or getting a job.	Okanye ukuya esikolweni okanye ukufumana umsebenzi.
Not me then.	Hayi mna ke.
Here this is not the case.	Apha oku akunjalo.
And he never could do it.	Kwaye akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
He will have to try another one.	Kuya kufuneka azame enye.
That means big money.	Oko kuthetha imali enkulu.
He opened one, and began reading.	Wavula enye, waza waqalisa ukufunda.
It's better without him.	Kungcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
This really happened a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu ngokwenene.
No, that's not me.	Hayi, ayindim lowo.
If not, no problem.	Ukuba akunjalo, akukho ngxaki.
Yes or no.	Ewe okanye hayi.
One might be right for you.	Enye inokuba ilungile kuwe.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
It is good to continue that way.	Yinto entle ukuqhuba ngaloo ndlela.
Soon he made a decision.	Kungekudala wenza isigqibo.
I am a person.	Ndim umntu.
Almost there! 	Sele uza kufika!
No one knows the truth now.	Akukho mntu uyazi inyani ngoku.
But there are some questions.	Kodwa kukho imibuzo ethile.
But he heard someone.	Kodwa weva umntu.
And really, of course.	Kwaye ngokwenene, kunjalo.
I can sing.	Ndiyakwazi ukucula.
I'll get to that.	Ndiya kufika kuloo nto.
I will need some.	Ndiza kufuna ezinye.
This always happens.	Oku kuhlala kwenzeka.
He was afraid to tell you the truth at that moment.	Wayesoyika ukukuxelela inyani ngelo xesha.
No thanks.	Hayi, enkosi.
We have done a very good job.	Senze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
I will do it for all of us.	Ndiza kuyenza kuthi sonke.
Because again that is possible.	Kuba kwakhona oko kunokwenzeka.
I don't know any other way.	Andazi enye indlela.
He said he knew.	Uthe uyazi.
Don't wait until you're older.	Musa ukulinda ukuba ube mdala.
But again, he did not want to.	Kodwa kwakhona, akazange afune.
It is difficult to succeed like that.	Kunzima ukuphumelela ngolo hlobo.
The gun is ready.	Umpu ukulungele.
At first, he refused.	Ekuqaleni, akazange avume.
It seems to be the case now.	Kubonakala ngathi kunjalo ngoku.
Obviously it is.	Ngokucacileyo kunjalo.
Everything seemed perfectly fine.	Konke kwakubonakala kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Books books.	Iincwadi iincwadi.
Everything is fine, here.	Yonke into ilungile, apha.
But he had to leave.	Kodwa kwafuneka ahambe.
That's the only time problem.	Loo nto ingxaki ixesha kuphela.
And he was very scared.	Kwaye wayesoyika kakhulu.
He wants you to do that, too.	Ufuna ukuba wenze loo nto, nawe.
Playing the piano.	Ukudlala ipiyano.
He asked that today, too.	Wabuza ukuba namhlanje, kakhulu.
You just can’t go to the place or buy.	Awukwazi nje ukuya kwindawo okanye ukuthenga.
He wants to help.	Uyafuna ukunceda.
But still, that’s up to me.	Kodwa kunjalo, oko kum.
It can have it, though.	Inokuba nayo, nangona kunjalo.
I want to die.	Ndifuna ukufa.
But he is so every day.	Kodwa unjalo yonke imihla.
But death did occur.	Kodwa ukufa kwenzeka.
He would go on with it.	Wayeza kuqhubeka nayo.
Probably both.	Mhlawumbi bobabini.
And they will tell him.	Kwaye baya kumxelela .
That would mean it would be a little difficult.	Oko kuya kuthetha ukuba kuya kuba nzima kancinci.
In that case it is difficult.	Kuloo meko kunzima.
I did not go with it.	Andizange ndihambe nayo.
No matter how hard you try.	Nokuba uzama kangakanani na.
This will be very fun.	Oku kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
We need both.	Kufuneka sobabini.
That's why it takes time.	Yiyo loo nto kuthatha ixesha.
He went back to where he was doing.	Wabuyela apho wayenza.
A good, good person.	Umntu olungileyo, olungileyo.
Look here today.	Jonga apha namhlanje.
Then you must have fallen asleep.	Emva koko umele ukuba uye walala.
Nobody does it this way.	Akukho mntu wenza ngale ndlela.
In this case .	Kule meko .
You are more successful than I am.	Uphumelele ngakumbi kunam.
I would very much like to quit.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuyeka.
With it again.	Ngalo kwakhona.
You did very well with this.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu ngale nto.
But I am.	Ndim ke kodwa.
I do not like you and I do not like you.	Andikuthandi kwaye andikuthandi.
He found something.	Wafumana into.
Stop trying to do something.	Yeka ukuzama ukuyenza into.
Now I know better.	Ngoku ndiyazi ngcono.
not sure.	andiqinisekanga.
He lived alone.	Wahlala yedwa ngokupheleleyo.
Why did he do that?	Kwakutheni ukuze enze loo nto.
Maybe next week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo.
Sorry everyone.	Uxolo wonke umntu.
I could not stop after that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka emva koko.
It just so happens, that's all there is to it.	Kwenzeka, yiloo nto kuphela.
He has to think so.	Kufuneka acinge njalo.
That way they will be with you.	Ngaloo ndlela baya kuba nawe kunye nawe.
His whole mistake.	Impazamo yakhe yonke.
Yeah, a little bit of it.	Ewe, kancinci kuyo.
She decided to talk about him.	Wagqiba kwelokuba athethe ngaye.
Give me the phone.	Ndinike ifowuni.
It will be painful, too.	Kuya kuba buhlungu, kwakhona.
Well, what were you supposed to do? 	Kulungile, bekufanele wenze ntoni?
He certainly needed help.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayefuna uncedo.
Moreover, it must be so.	Ngaphezu koko, kufuneka kube njalo.
I never said that.	Khange ndithethe njalo.
He didn't know until then.	Wayengazi kude kube ngoko.
I will not go there.	Andiyi kuya apho.
I want him to do something.	Ndifuna ukuba enze into.
Yes, you have.	Ewe, unayo.
But that is not a big problem.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo ingxaki enkulu leyo.
I did not go to his room at night.	Zange ndiye egumbini lakhe ebusuku.
And look how that happened.	Kwaye jonga ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
I look at people.	Ndijonge abantu.
There is no exit to this.	Akukho ukuphuma kule.
But that's all for now.	Kodwa oko konke okwangoku.
Don't read, just look.	Musa ukufunda, jonga nje.
Thanks, okay.	Enkosi, kulungile.
And you have it in your house.	Kwaye unayo endlwini yakho.
I have never done this before.	Khange ndiyenze le nto ngaphambili.
He also told the police.	Naye waxelela amapolisa.
It's very difficult now.	Kunzima kakhulu ngoku.
He doesn't want you to think about it.	Akafuni ukuba ucinge ngayo.
It will be very difficult to do this.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu ukwenza oku.
He can have it everywhere for you.	Unokuba nayo yonke indawo kuwe.
I know where I am going.	Ndiyazi apho ndiya khona.
So we will wait.	Ngoko ke siza kulinda.
But you are better.	Kodwa ungcono.
He did not know who he was.	Wayengazi ukuba ngubani na.
That's it for now.	Nantso ke okwangoku.
Where, or how long, he did not know.	Uphi, okanye ixesha elingakanani, wayengazi.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngomso, kodwa kungekudala.
Or anything too, about that.	Okanye nantoni na kakhulu, ngaloo nto.
Yes, you should go to him.	Ewe, kufuneka uye kuye.
I did well.	Ndiyenze kakuhle.
Sorry, but this is true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani le.
Eventually that happened.	Ekugqibeleni kwenzeka oko.
But we will be.	Kodwa siya kuba.
Police everywhere.	Amapolisa kuyo yonke indawo.
He never spoke to me like this.	Zange athethe nam ngolu hlobo.
Unless something is clearly wrong, it is.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho into engalunganga ngokucacileyo, kunjalo.
Now, that happens right away.	Ngoku, oko kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
I wanted more from him.	Ndandifuna okuninzi kuye.
Not just this time, but earlier.	Hayi nje ngeli xesha, kodwa ngaphambili.
It's absolutely something.	Yinto ngokupheleleyo.
But you may say that it is hard to imagine.	Kodwa mhlawumbi uthi kunzima nje ukucinga.
One more thing, that.	Enye into, leyo.
Almost completely.	Phantse ngokupheleleyo.
You will be.	Uya kuba .
Thank you, but not thank you.	Enkosi, kodwa hayi enkosi.
Again, this is something you almost don't want to do.	Kwakhona, le yinto phantse awufuni ukuyenza.
Just like he wasn't here.	Kanye njengokuba wayengekho apha.
He'll go fast, he'll go, he thought.	Uza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza, uya kuhamba, wacinga.
I don't know what you're really thinking here.	Andiqondi ukuba ucinga ntoni kanye kanye apha.
It will be fine one day.	Kuya kuba kuhle ngenye imini.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo.
He is trying another approach.	Uzama enye indlela.
I wanted my book.	Bendifuna incwadi yam.
Just everything.	Konke nje.
It's long outside.	Kudala phandle.
I hope you will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuba njalo.
I didn't talk to her, either.	Khange ndithethe naye, nam.
But more on that later.	Kodwa ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
I always think that.	Ndihlala ndicinga loo nto.
You definitely should be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ube.
It can be fun to play with your kids, either.	Kunokuba mnandi ukudlala nabantwana bakho, nokuba.
He was always afraid of who he was.	Ngalo lonke ixesha wayesoyika ukuba nguye.
She was scared, yes.	Wayesoyika, ewe.
He needed help immediately.	Kwafuneka afune uncedo ngoko nangoko.
He is sleeping now.	Ulele ngoku.
He couldn’t stop talking, though.	Akazange akwazi ukuyeka ukuthetha, nangona kunjalo.
And thank you very much.	Kwaye enkosi kakhulu.
Probably none of us.	Mhlawumbi akukho namnye kuthi.
And really.	Kwaye ngokwenene.
Probably all.	Mhlawumbi bonke.
They will stay here all day.	Baza kuhlala apha imini yonke.
These conditions.	Le meko .
How can that be.	Inokuba njani loo nto.
He's a strange little man.	Yindoda encinci engaqhelekanga.
I just want to know.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi .
We all know exactly what this is.	Sonke siyazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye le nto.
But it didn't, really.	Kodwa ayizange, ngokwenene.
The big picture.	Umfanekiso omkhulu.
I know how to do what is right.	Ndiyazi ukwenza into elungileyo.
Too much car.	Imoto eninzi kakhulu.
He went right down in front of her.	Wehla kanye phambi kwakhe.
He never thought of taking anyone.	Akazange acinge ukuthatha nabani na.
You look better.	Ukhangeleka ngcono.
Give me a number.	Ndinike inombolo.
I feel like I need coffee.	Ndiziva ndifuna ikofu.
Well all week, really.	Kulungile iveki yonke, ngokwenene.
He too was not hurt.	Naye akazange abe buhlungu.
You always work your way up.	Uhlala usebenza ngendlela yakho.
He knew it would come in a long time.	Wayesazi ukuba iya kufika ixesha elide.
That's what we have to do.	Yinto ekufuneka siyenze.
But he is sleeping.	Kodwa ulele.
Tell me anything.	Ndixelele nantoni na.
And he agreed with me.	Uye wavuma nam.
He will surely live again to be in place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala kwakhona ukuba kwindawo.
If you are tired now.	Ukuba udiniwe ngoku.
I will do it soon.	Ndiza kwenza ngokukhawuleza.
And he began to speak by himself.	Waza waqalisa ukuthetha yedwa.
And he did not want to.	Naye akafuni.
I need to be able to see.	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukubona.
Does that mean that.	Ngaba oko kuthetha ukuba .
He would be gone.	Wayeza kube engekho.
He saw an opportunity for us.	Wabona ithuba kuthi.
Is that me?	Ngaba ndim lowo.
But you have to do your thing.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze into yakho.
In the end, a great job.	Ekugqibeleni, umsebenzi omkhulu.
And everything.	Kwaye yonke into.
This makes it easier to work together.	Oku kwenza kube lula ngakumbi ukusebenza kunye.
Knowing that no one is coming.	Ukwazi ukuba akukho mntu uza kuza.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siza kwenza njalo.
That will make it much easier to work together.	Oko kuya kwenza kube lula kakhulu ukusebenza kunye.
Come on in, take a look.	Uza kuza.
But, if he was not there.	Kodwa, ukuba wayengekho.
He wanted to say something else.	Wayefuna ukuthetha enye into.
See you next week.	Ndiza kubona kwiveki ezayo.
Have you seen one before?	Wakhe wabona enye ngaphambili.
This will be good for us.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle kuthi.
But number one.	Kodwa inombolo enye.
But one has to think differently.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka acinge ngenye indlela.
If you do this, then stop doing this.	Ukuba wenza oku, ngoko yeka ukwenza oku.
Maybe I think a lot about it.	Mhlawumbi ndicinga kakhulu ngayo.
I really am.	Ndim ngokwenene.
It should be easy to see.	Kufuneka kube lula ukubona.
if so which way.	ukuba kunjalo yeyiphi indlela.
However, we will get something.	Nangona kunjalo, siza kufumana into.
But how every day.	Kodwa njani yonke imihla.
We are not going anywhere immediately.	Asiyi kuya ndawo ngokukhawuleza.
But it will not be a big deal.	Kodwa akuyi kuba yinto enkulu.
Thanks for lunch, of course.	Enkosi ngesidlo sasemini, kunjalo.
There was no problem at all.	Kwakungekho ngxaki kwaphela.
I look forward to meeting you.	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana nawe.
You look perfectly fine.	Ubonakala ulungile ngokupheleleyo.
You are definitely tired.	Ngokuqinisekileyo udiniwe.
And you will find breakfast in it.	Kwaye uya kufumana isidlo sakusasa kuyo.
But he did not tell her that.	Kodwa akazange amxelele loo nto.
Not until you leave.	Hayi de uhambe.
He did not have it well.	Akazange abe nayo kakuhle.
He was not in college.	Wayengekho ekholejini.
Everyone loves this.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda le nto.
I thought about everything.	Ndacinga ngayo yonke into.
And now with you.	Kwaye ngoku kunye nawe.
No problem for him.	Akukho ngxaki kuye.
He wanted coffee very much.	Wayefuna ikofu kakhulu.
That can be frustrating.	Oko kunokuba buhlungu.
Before, really.	Ngaphambili, ngokwenene.
It's harder than you think.	Kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba ucinga.
Not yet, not yet.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ngoko.
Not so much with me.	Hayi kakhulu nam.
Nobody is here.	Akukho mntu ulapha.
Maybe he was scared to know.	Mhlawumbi wayesoyika ukwazi.
Very good indeed.	Kakuhle kakhulu ngenene.
No, not more.	Hayi, hayi ngakumbi.
You may want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbi ungathanda ukuthetha ngayo.
In the end he is invisible.	Ekugqibeleni akabonakali.
This is a really big deal.	Le yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
It could be him.	Usenokuba nguye.
It may be so.	Inokuba kunjalo.
It takes you to the top.	Kuthatha wena ukuya phezulu.
I wanted to get out of there quickly.	Ndandifuna ukuphuma apho ngokukhawuleza.
Being a man is not necessary.	Ukuba yindoda akuyomfuneko.
He went there in front of me.	Waya apho phambi kwam.
No mistake, no.	Hayi impazamo, hayi.
I can't wait for it to happen.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuba kwenzeke.
And something else happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka enye into.
They will do so.	Baza kwenza njalo.
Good old man.	Mhle mdala .
But it is a big deal.	Kodwa yinto enkulu.
Tell me when.	Ndixelele nini.
Next week, or soon.	Kwiveki ezayo, okanye kungekudala.
I had to go with it.	Kwafuneka ndihambe nayo.
Sorry, really.	Uxolo, ngokwenene.
But it is not very pleasant to work with him.	Kodwa akukho mnandi kakhulu ukusebenza naye.
He has to think.	Kufuneka acinge.
So there you have it.	Ngoko kukho kuwe.
I wish you success and always want to be better.	Ndinqwenela ukuphumelela kwaye ndihlala ndifuna ukuba ngcono.
But no one expects that to happen.	Kodwa akukho mntu ulindele ukuba oko kwenzeke.
Because you think you can do that to me.	Kuba ucinga ukuba ungayenza loo nto kum.
He wants to go to me.	Ufuna ukuya kum.
This will do it.	Oku kuya kukwenza.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba .
She has slept better.	Uye walala ngcono.
Well, it didn't matter to him at all.	Ewe, kwakungekho nto ingako kuye konke konke.
We'll just do it.	Siza kuyenza nje.
And he gave it to me.	Uye wandinika.
That would be very painful.	Oko bekuya kuba buhlungu kakhulu.
That means about everything.	Oko kuthetha malunga nayo yonke into.
Not all the way.	Hayi yonke indlela.
So there is just one more thing.	Ngoko kukho nje enye into.
He began to control himself.	Waqalisa ukuzibamba.
Whatever happens will happen soon.	Nantoni na eza kwenzeka iza kwenzeka kungekudala.
She's smart, but she's good.	Ukrelekrele, kodwa ulungile.
I want to know what happened and why.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kwaye kutheni.
I don't care, she thought.	Andikhathali, wacinga.
If you do, everything will be better.	Ukuba uyayenza, yonke into iya kuba ngcono.
Sorry it would be nice.	Uxolo bekuya kuba kuhle.
Everything will be fine in the end.	Yonke into iya kuhamba kakuhle ekugqibeleni.
I knew this was going to happen, he thought.	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka, wacinga njalo.
It was not necessary at all.	Kwakungeyomfuneko kwaphela.
Here is the problem.	Apha kukho ingxaki.
And that's exactly right.	Kwaye kunjalo ngokwenene.
Surely you would like to know about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ungathanda ukwazi ngayo.
That would take two hours.	Oko bekuya kuthatha iiyure ezimbini.
He knows nothing about it.	Akazi nto ngayo.
No and no.	Hayi kwaye hayi.
See, if you want to stay here.	Jonga, ukuba ufuna ukuhlala apha.
Well, tell me a little bit, though.	Ke, ndixelele kancinci, nangona kunjalo.
He felt like he had to sit down.	Waziva ngathi kufuneka ahlale phantsi.
He agreed to quit.	Wavuma ukuyeka.
It will take more than one of us.	Kuya kuthatha ngaphezu komnye wethu.
He tried to walk but could not.	Wazama ukuhamba kodwa akakwazi.
Just as we will be.	Kanye njengokuba siya kuba.
You do not have to do too many things.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
It doesn't have to be true.	Akufuneki ukuba yinyani.
Everyone talked about it.	Wonke umntu wathetha ngayo.
He could not stay in it.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala kuyo.
He can read.	Uyakwazi ukufunda.
For the time being,.	Ngeli xesha,.
We know about it.	Siyazi ngayo.
Yet our work is a good thing, too.	Nangona kunjalo umsebenzi wethu yinto entle, nayo.
It would be nice though.	Kuya kuba kuhle nangona.
Moreover, he was no longer a human.	Ngaphezu koko, akazange aphinde abe ngumntu.
This is the case however.	Oku kunjalo nangona kunjalo.
He told me it was him.	Wandixelela ukuba nguye.
I can't do it right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza kakuhle okwangoku.
He asked a question.	Wabuza umbuzo.
And it is likely that it will be so.	Kwaye kunokwenzeka ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
I have never had that problem.	Andizange ndibe nayo loo ngxaki.
Just one person.	Umntu nje omnye.
Even one will last for years.	Nokuba enye iya kuhlala iminyaka.
He left early and returned home later.	Wemka kwangethuba waza wabuyela ekhaya emva kwexesha.
He should talk to me.	Kufuneka athethe nam.
Maybe that wasn't necessary.	Mhlawumbi oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
And it doesn't have to be long.	Kwaye akufuneki kube ixesha elide.
I sit with him in front of me all day long.	Ndihlala nayo phambi kwam imini yonke.
Please, please do something like that.	Nceda, nceda wenze into enjalo.
Good, but probably too hard.	Kuhle, kodwa mhlawumbi kunzima kakhulu.
I knew better, though.	Ndandisazi ngcono, nangona kunjalo.
Speaking of, nothing else.	Ukuthetha, akukho enye into.
There are many flowers.	Kukho iintyatyambo ezininzi.
Old shirt.	Ihempe endala.
He has gone out with me.	Uye waphuma nam.
He just wanted more time.	Wayefuna nje ixesha elingakumbi.
He came out on time.	Waphuma ngexesha.
Most day.	Imini eninzi.
Not just you.	Akunjalo nje wena.
Yes, there is another problem.	Ewe, kukho enye ingxaki.
We want to know how and why and where.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuba njani kwaye kutheni kwaye phi.
He talked with her for a few hours.	Wathetha naye iiyure ezimbalwa.
I can do this too.	Nam ndingayenza lento.
She was sitting next to him.	Wayehlala ecaleni kwakhe.
And everyone will be better.	Kwaye wonke umntu uya kuba ngcono.
So we'll talk about that later.	Ngoko siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
Then, after me.	Emva koko, emva kwam.
No one should be present.	Akukho mntu kufuneka abe khona.
Then he saw a light.	Emva koko wabona isibane.
But none of us.	Kodwa akukho namnye kuthi.
And you think fast.	Kwaye ucinga ngokukhawuleza.
And you have to do it fast.	Kwaye kufuneka uyenze ngokukhawuleza.
You will sink.	Uza kuzama.
You will get nothing from it.	Awuyi kufumana nto kuloo nto.
It is not easy at home.	Akukho lula ekhaya.
But if he did, he would be late.	Kodwa ukuba uyenzile, wayeza kufika emva kwexesha.
Mother, yes.	Umama, ewe.
We went down together.	Siye phantsi kunye.
Certainly not money.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi imali.
Not so everywhere.	Akunjalo kuyo yonke indawo.
Well, that's what happened.	Ewe, nantso into eyenzekayo.
He did a lot.	Wayenza into eninzi.
Then he thought of money.	Emva koko wacinga ngemali.
Man knows his own thing.	Umntu uyayazi into yakhe.
But this is okay.	Kodwa oku kulungile.
You just want to come for a few weeks.	Ufuna nje ukuza iiveki ezimbalwa.
Playful, but just a little bit.	Ukudlala, kodwa nje kancinci.
I did it once.	Ndenze kanye.
All but me.	Bonke ngaphandle kwam.
He also understood.	Kwakhona waqonda.
But there was nobody there.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu kwaphela.
It will go without you.	Iza kuhamba ngaphandle kwakho.
I'm not sure if anything old.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho into endala.
I want that, you want that, we all want that.	Ndifuna lonto, ufuna lonto, sonke sifuna lonto.
Her mother has been sitting next to her.	Umama wakhe uye wahlala ecaleni kwakhe.
And inside of us.	Kwaye ngaphakathi kuthi.
Just in his time.	Kanye ngexesha lakhe.
He wanted another way.	Wayefuna enye indlela.
This one needs help.	Lo ufuna uncedo.
I shall certainly come.	ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuza.
Therefore, you will need to do this job.	Ke ngoko, kuya kufuneka wenze lo msebenzi.
And you have to come, too.	Kwaye kufuneka uze, nawe.
It could be or.	Inokuba okanye.
And you behind him.	Nawe emva kwakhe.
He is not in it himself.	Akakho kuyo ngokwakhe.
Good when good.	Kuhle xa kulungile.
I live upstairs.	Ndihlala phezulu.
Finally he came out.	Ekugqibeleni waphuma.
Maybe both of them together.	Mhlawumbi bobabini kunye.
Then this time.	Emva koko ngeli xesha.
She told me.	Uye wandixelela.
People will want everything.	Abantu baya kufuna yonke into.
Let me read.	Makhe ndifunde.
There is someone behind me.	Kukho umntu emva kwam.
I know she loves him.	Ndiyamazi uyamthanda.
John readily agreed.	UJohn wavuma ngoko nangoko.
You work to speak your voice.	Usebenza ukuthetha ilizwi lakho.
Everyone wants children.	Wonke umntu ufuna abantwana.
Sooner or later you will have to make a decision.	Kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
I'm sure there is something.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho into.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, nguye ngaphandle.
I try very hard to read.	Ndizama kakhulu ukufunda.
So, what are you waiting for?	Ke, ulindele ntoni?
I think he lives in his car.	Ndicinga ukuba uhlala emotweni yakhe.
Maybe you like that, too.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda loo nto, nawe.
My wife .	Umfazi wam .
I know, too.	Ndiyazi, nam.
But now you know you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi ukuba uyazi.
He walked alone there.	Uhambe wedwa phaya.
But everything is moving slowly.	Kodwa konke kuhamba kancinci.
It’s not like it’s hard.	Akunjalo ngathi kunzima.
He went to that place and sat down.	Waya kuloo ndawo wahlala phantsi.
Yeah, yeah, we know.	Ewe, ewe, siyazi.
He has not returned home since.	Akazange agoduke ukusukela ngoko.
Because that's what.	Kuba yiloo nto.
He sat down, he had to think.	Wahlala phantsi, kwafuneka acinge.
Look at what he did.	Ujonge into ayenzileyo.
It means everything is fine.	Kuthetha ukuba yonke into ilungile.
I finished eating.	Ndagqiba ukutya.
In the bedroom that.	Kwigumbi lokulala ukuba.
I have never heard of such a thing.	Andizange ndive ngento enje.
But this is not difficult.	Kodwa oku akukho nzima.
As long as you did this.	Nje ukuba uyenzile le nto.
And that's it.	Kwaye yinto.
It wasn’t really him, obviously.	Yayingenguye ngokwenene, ngokucacileyo.
I look at something all the time.	Ndijonge into ngalo lonke ixesha.
He spoke a word.	Wathetha ilizwi.
Holding each other together is hard.	Ukuzibamba kunye kunzima.
Not so much tonight.	Hayi kakhulu ngokuhlwanje.
Thank you, for one thing.	Enkosi, ngento enye.
It will be easier to see which one.	Kuya kuba lula ukubona ukuba yeyiphi.
But this is not the case everywhere.	Kodwa oku akunjalo kuyo yonke indawo.
Like, that's it.	Njengokuba, loo nto.
No one knew better.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngcono.
But there have been others.	Kodwa kuye kwakho abanye.
I came here to help.	Ndize apha ukunceda.
I'm glad to get an answer.	Ndiyavuya ukufumana impendulo.
Please go well.	Nceda uhambe kakuhle.
He went first.	Waya kuqala.
It will take a very long time to get here.	Baza kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu ukufika apha.
You always look up.	Uhlala ujonge ukuya phezulu.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ayizange yenzeke into enje apha.
There he stayed for a long time.	Apho wahlala ixesha elide.
I mean you just did.	Ndithetha ukuba wenze nje.
I hope you will make friends there.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kwenza abahlobo apho.
I'm sure he meant everything in a better way.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba wayethetha yonke into ngendlela engcono.
But personally I love this approach.	Kodwa ngokwam ndiyayithanda le ndlela.
They say, there is no way.	Bathi, akukho ndlela.
This is true and this is it.	Le yinyani kwaye ndim lo.
But then he thought better of it.	Kodwa emva koko wacinga ngcono.
He is here now.	Ukhona ngoku .
You just want to see something good about it.	Ufuna nje ukubona into entle ngayo.
Not where he lives, of course.	Hayi apho ahlala khona, kunjalo.
And in the end, one definitely needs to.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, umntu ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka.
He will definitely buy from you again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuthenga kuwe kwakhona.
We go to the room.	Siya egumbini.
I would like to go now too.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba ngoku kakhulu.
So we know how you got home.	Siyazi ke ukuba ufike njani ekhaya.
We need to build things.	Kufuneka sakhe izinto.
But really everything.	Kodwa ngokwenene yonke into.
I hope you like it too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uyayithanda.
He ran the ball.	Wabaleka ibhola.
This is really.	Oku ngokwenene .
And then he realized he wasn't there.	Kwaye emva koko waqonda ukuba wayengekho.
I want to try this.	Ndifuna ukuzama oku.
And now tell me.	Ke ngoku ndixelele.
He did so for about two hours.	Wakwenza oko phantse iiyure ezimbini.
He decided that this was the right thing to do.	Wagqiba kwelokuba oku kulungile.
I thought you knew that.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi lonto.
I'm not sure how long.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ixesha elingakanani.
It's a very good thing that.	Yinto entle kakhulu ukuba.
This is not entirely the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
But you did something wrong.	Kodwa wenze into embi.
Do you have any girlfriends.	Ngaba unayo nayiphi na intombi.
Not a big problem, no.	Hayi ingxaki enkulu, hayi.
Stop reading that.	Yeka ukufunda oko.
If that happens, everything else will be the same.	Ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka, yonke enye into iya kuba njalo.
You think about it every night.	Ucinga ngayo rhoqo ebusuku.
Tomorrow, for sure.	Ngomso, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Then three, and so on.	Emva koko abathathu, njalo njalo.
I can do things very quickly.	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza izinto ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He can do it now, do it here.	Angayenza ngoku, ayenze apha.
He would speak.	Wayeza kuthetha.
He asked for help from me.	Wacela uncedo kum.
He didn't seem to be feeling good.	Wayengabonakali ngathi uziva mnandi.
I went right there.	Ndaya apho kanye.
We should have been both then.	Bekufanele sibe sobabini ngoko.
He knew.	Wayesazi .
All the time together, but you live alone.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kunye, kodwa uhlala wedwa.
That will mean a great way.	Oko kuya kuthetha indlela enkulu.
Yes it is possible.	Ewe kunokwenzeka.
He works on that, though.	Usebenza kuloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
Look at the question with you.	Jonga lo mbuzo nawe.
And more.	Kwakhona ngakumbi.
There is something very wrong with this.	Kukho into embi kakhulu ngale nto.
That would be great.	Oko kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
You totally, you don't.	Wena ngokupheleleyo, awuyi.
She is much older than you.	Mdala kakhulu kunawe.
So thank you so much for that.	Ngoko enkosi kakhulu ngaloo nto.
He doesn't think anything at all.	Akacingi nto kwaphela.
So you just stay, you know.	Ngoko uhlala nje, uyazi.
So, almost everything then.	Ngoko, phantse yonke into ngoko.
Then we will do nothing.	Emva koko asiyi kwenza nto.
She thought about him all the time.	Wayecinga ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha.
But all of this is not the case.	Kodwa konke oku akunjalo.
Please and thank you.	Nceda kwaye enkosi.
You can play side to side.	Uyakwazi ukudlala ecaleni ukuya ecaleni.
Before we do that, though.	Ngaphambi kokuba senze oko, nangona kunjalo.
Thank you for doing your job.	Enkosi ngokwenza umsebenzi wakho.
But he probably didn't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akazange.
But other things.	Kodwa ezinye izinto.
Finally, he said.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi.
Obviously you can do that.	Kucacile ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
He did a lot.	Wenza kakhulu.
I want friends.	Ndifuna abahlobo.
I desperately want to go to him.	Ndifuna kakubi ukuya kuye.
My father was furious.	Utata waba nomsindo.
You may be doing something very wrong.	Usenokuba wenza into engalunganga kakhulu.
The truth is that they did not.	Inyaniso kukuba abazange.
You have to stay where people live.	Kufuneka uhlale apho abantu bahlala khona.
Yes I am happy.	Ewe ndiyavuya.
You will have to think about yourself.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngawe.
He is not visible to you.	Akabonakali kuwe.
Taking my time.	Ukuthatha ixesha lam.
But it is certainly not possible now.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka ngoku.
If you live in the city, then all is well.	Ukuba uhlala edolophini, ke konke kulungile.
My life, of course.	Ubomi bam, kunjalo.
I wanted to talk to us before we left.	Bendifuna ukuthetha nathi phambi kokuba sihambe.
Yes, you do too.	Ewe, nawe wenza njalo.
I'm sure you don't know.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba awuyazi.
But he was thinking.	Kodwa wayecinga.
He didn't look very good.	Wayengabonakali kakuhle.
Clearly not.	Kucacile ukuba akazange.
I didn’t do it then.	Andizange ndiyenze ngelo xesha.
He made a few mistakes.	Wenza iimpazamo ezimbalwa.
Well, it's not.	Kulungile, akunjalo.
Thus, there is a similar problem.	Ngaloo ndlela, kukho ingxaki efanayo.
So are they there or someone else.	Ngoko ngaba bakho okanye omnye umntu.
Only about him.	Kuphela ngaye.
That now evening.	Ukuba ngoku ngokuhlwa.
You just have to be able to do that.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukwenza oko.
No one .	Akukho namnye .
I had to think it was possible.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Give me a little.	Ndinike kancinci.
But also .	Kodwa kwakhona .
He makes my job easier.	Wenza umsebenzi wam ube lula.
I think you want to talk to me alone.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nam ndedwa.
I would like to think.	Ndingathanda ukucinga.
My wife came with me.	Umfazi wam weza nam.
I don't want to do it right away.	Andifuni ukuyenza kwangoko.
Something like that.	Into enje .
I want you to stay here behind me.	Ndifuna uhlala apha emva kwam.
We will stay.	Siza kuhlala.
But you know, you have to.	Kodwa uyazi, kufuneka ngokuqinisekileyo.
It's not just me, me, me.	Ayindim kuphela, mna, mna.
This will not happen.	Oku akuyi kwenzeka.
Certainly not in the same way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo ngendlela efanayo.
It would be great.	Kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
I feel very tired.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe kakhulu.
I want to go to the hospital.	Ndifuna ukuya esibhedlele.
Not a job.	Hayi umsebenzi.
And he never talked to me about it.	Kwaye akazange athethe nam ngayo.
But he did this.	Kodwa uyenzile le nto.
Not to get into him.	Hayi ukuba angene kuye.
And you work on it, you know.	Kwaye usebenza kuyo, uyazi.
We need his help now.	Sifuna uncedo lwakhe ngoku.
You know how long it takes.	Uyazi ukuba kuthatha ixesha elingakanani .
He is not as tall as you.	Akakho mde njengawe.
I wanted it hard.	Ndandifuna nzima.
You have to tell me about it.	Kufuneka undixelele ngayo.
Or maybe not even true.	Okanye mhlawumbi hayi nokuba yinyani.
You need to talk to him now.	Kufuneka uthethe naye ngoku.
There are only people.	Kukho abantu kuphela.
But he was not thinking.	Kodwa wayengacingi.
You will be much better then.	Uzakuba ngcono kakhulu ngelo xesha.
No one really knows what happened next.	Akukho mntu wazi kakuhle ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Not much of it.	Akukho kakhulu kuyo.
He asked where she was.	Wabuza ukuba uphi.
But now he knew why.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
I love this situation.	Ndiyayithanda le meko.
Everyone seemed absent.	Wonke umntu wayebonakala engekho.
Any place for me.	Nayiphi na indawo yam.
Maybe you should do it.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uyenzile.
There is only you.	Kukho wena kuphela.
And yes! 	Kwaye ewe!
Nothing, or not at all.	Akukho nto, okanye ayisiyiyo kwaphela.
All once or for all at a time.	Konke kanye okanye kancinci ngexesha.
What, and how to have it.	Yintoni, kwaye njani ukuba nayo.
I speak the same way now.	Ndithetha ngendlela efanayo ngoku.
Or not too early in the evening.	Okanye hayi kwangoko kakhulu ngokuhlwa.
He sat down quickly.	Wahlala ngokukhawuleza.
But now we know better.	Kodwa ngoku siyazi ngcono.
And you have a way.	Kwaye unayo indlela.
Or the morning after.	Okanye kusasa emva koko.
I think you want something like that.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna into enjalo.
He asked me to study with him.	Wandicela ukuba ndifunde nam.
But a little, though.	Kodwa kancinci, nangona kunjalo.
I'm not having a hard time.	Andikho nzima.
We are leaving tonight.	Siza kuhamba ngokuhlwanje.
yes maybe.	ewe mhlawumbi.
I like it out here.	Ndiyayithanda apha phandle.
I'm trying to tell you.	Ndizama ukukuxelela.
Nobody did anything about it.	Akukho mntu wenze nto ngayo.
My father told me about it.	Utata wandixelela ngayo.
I'm talking about that.	Ndithetha ngaloo nto.
Today should be easier.	Namhlanje kufuneka kube lula.
I just know I am.	Ndiyakwazi nje ukuba ndim.
He is all.	Nguye wonke.
And this can be very difficult.	Kwaye oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekileyo.
My man always goes to his house.	Umntu wam uya rhoqo endlini yakhe.
He felt better to have it.	Waziva engcono ukuba nayo.
I hope it wasn't too painful.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kwakungekho buhlungu kakhulu.
I'm not here for that.	Andikho apha malunga naloo nto.
And we did it all together.	Kwaye senze konke kunye.
He did that for years.	Wayenza loo nto iminyaka.
He did this.	Wenza oku.
I never heard of that place.	Zange ndive ngaloo ndawo.
But not this time, no, no way.	Kodwa hayi ngeli xesha, hayi, akukho ndlela.
Or there was nothing he wanted to do.	Okanye akukho nto wayefuna ukuyenza.
That would be a good thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle.
Here, we have done something else.	Apha, senze enye into.
And it never was true.	Kwaye akuzange kube yinyani.
He has been very sad.	Uye waba buhlungu kakhulu.
But we will not go there.	Kodwa asiyi kuya apho.
I hope they will be back soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kubuya ngokukhawuleza.
But you are smart enough.	Kodwa ukrelekrele ngokwaneleyo.
You eat anything.	Utya nantoni na.
At first, he was afraid of his gift.	Ekuqaleni, wayesoyika isipho sakhe.
Some people go far away.	Abanye abantu baya kude.
He will be home very late at night.	Uza kubuya ebusuku kakhulu ekhaya.
I told you anything.	Ndikuxelele nantoni na.
No one really knows.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
He should have been coming to my house soon.	Bekufanele ukuba sele eza endlini yam kungekudala.
He would return one day.	Wayeza kubuya ngenye imini.
We need to go talk.	Kufuneka sihambe intetho.
Now she loves it.	Ngoku uyayithanda.
He spoke softly.	Wathetha kancinci.
He will always be that way.	Uya kuhlala enjalo.
Or not so much.	Okanye hayi kakhulu kunjalo.
Today, you know better.	Namhlanje, wazi ngcono.
But, you know.	Kodwa, uyazi.
You did something else.	Nguwe owenze enye into.
I do a lot of things at school.	Ndenza izinto ezininzi esikolweni.
You knew it all the time.	Ubusazi lonke ixesha.
Not that he tried.	Hayi ukuba wazama.
You do not have to say that.	Akufunekanga uthethe njalo.
But there was no turning back.	Kodwa kwakungekho emva.
He spoke very quickly.	Wathetha ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
And then there is something else that is strange.	Kwaye ke kukho enye into engaqhelekanga.
One mind.	Ingqondo enye.
So, it's even harder.	Ngoko ke, kunzima ngakumbi.
Or something else that seems good to us.	Okanye enye into ebonakala ilungile kuthi.
He was also very dressed.	Naye wayenxibe kakhulu.
But perhaps not so much more attention.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi kangangoko ingqalelo ngakumbi.
That is a good thing for all of us.	Yinto entle leyo kuthi sonke.
I personally do not want to do that to anyone else.	Mna ngokwam andifuni kwenza loo nto komnye umntu.
But it is not at all easy.	Kodwa akukho lula ngokupheleleyo.
He did this for a long time.	Wakwenza oku ixesha elide.
That way you really read.	Ngaloo ndlela ufunda ngokwenene.
But it is very good.	Kodwa kuhle kakhulu.
No one really wants to know.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
It is impossible to know if it is true.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ukuba yinyani.
I'm sorry about that.	Uxolo lwam ngalonto.
Then many children.	Emva koko abantwana abaninzi.
Nice place though.	Indawo entle kodwa.
Not this week.	Hayi kule veki.
And he became her husband.	Kwaye waba yindoda yakhe.
Maybe maybe.	Mhlawumbi mhlawumbi.
But not tomorrow.	Kodwa hayi ngomso.
Me and you, and everyone.	Mna nawe, naye wonke umntu.
But it will be.	Kodwa iya kuba njalo.
Interested you should say that.	Unomdla kufuneka uthethe oko.
We have done this work regularly enough.	Senze lo msebenzi rhoqo ngokwaneleyo.
Not with him so high.	Hayi naye phezulu kangaka.
Beautiful, beautiful! ' 	Mhle, mhle!'
It wasn’t much then, though.	Kwakungekho nto ingako ngoko, nangona kunjalo.
You want that food.	Ufuna oko kutya.
You think about him all the time.	Ucinga ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha.
And it's hard to do.	Kwaye kunzima ukwenza.
Let me tell you about it, of course.	Makhe ndikuxelele, kunjalo.
Well then, not then.	Hayi ke, hayi ngoko.
Or you will have it soon.	Okanye uya kuba nayo kungekudala.
No one is talking about him.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngaye.
Nothing at all, either.	Akukho nto konke, mhlawumbi.
And stay tuned.	Kwaye uhlale uhleli.
But it will make some people more money.	Kodwa kuya kwenza abanye abantu imali eninzi.
Or why, with that.	Okanye kutheni, ngaloo nto.
I think you are scared.	Ndicinga ukuba uyoyika.
Outside, it never happened.	Ngaphandle, akuzange kwenzeke.
This happened to me this week.	Oku kwenzeke kum kule veki.
Everyone is really good.	Wonke umntu ulungile ngokwenene.
And you just know, nothing is going to happen to me.	Kwaye nje uyazi, akukho nto iya kwenzeka kum.
He says he loves it high.	Uthi uyayithanda phezulu.
He is the only employee.	Nguye kuphela umsebenzi.
To me, to him, to us.	Kum, kuye, kuthi.
What, not who.	Yintoni, hayi ngubani.
I'm trying to sing.	Ndizama ukucula.
I will not say more.	Andiyi kuthetha ngakumbi.
We'll start here this morning.	Siza kuqala apha kusasa.
So, that is not really the case.	Ngoko, akunjalo ngokwenene.
But reading requires attention.	Kodwa ukufunda kufuna ingqalelo.
But it is not, it is not.	Kodwa akunjalo, hayi.
That's right, that's right.	Unjalo, kunjalo.
There seemed to be no one.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akukho mntu.
Yes, he does.	Ewe, uyayenza ingxaki.
It all really happened.	Konke kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Please shop here only.	Nceda uthenge apha kuphela.
I have to go.	Ndifanele ndihambe.
Well, everyone knows everything here.	Ewe, wonke umntu uyazi yonke into apha.
Just as the work went out.	Kanye njengoko umsebenzi waphuma.
He went away and found something.	Waya kude wafumana into.
This simplifies the problem.	Oku kuyenza lula ingxaki.
I will not be all day.	Andiyi kuba imini yonke.
Something wonderful happened to him after that.	Kwenzeka into entle kuye emva koko.
It shouldn’t be, but it is.	Akufanele kube, kodwa kunjalo.
Quitting walking is not difficult or difficult.	Ukuyeka ukuhamba akukho nzima okanye kunzima.
I do it there.	Ndiyenza apho.
Now we know what he wanted.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba wayefuna ntoni.
I really have to sit down and really think about it.	Kufuneka ndihlale phantsi nyani ndicinge ngayo.
We'll have more time together before you leave.	Siza kuba nexesha elingakumbi kunye ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
If you want .	Ukuba uyafuna .
And you told him everything.	Kwaye umxelele yonke into.
He will say no.	Uya kuthi hayi.
Finally, finally.	Ekugqibeleni, ekugqibeleni.
Talk to him.	Uthethe naye.
Not only that, but you're good at it.	Akunjalo kuphela, kodwa ulungile ngaphandle koko.
I never thought it would be possible.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kunokwenzeka.
But enough about all of this.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo malunga nayo yonke le nto.
You need to make this a lot easier.	Kufuneka wenze oku kube lula kakhulu.
I saw for years.	Ndabona iminyaka.
And life.	Kwaye ubomi .
He will not go.	Akayi kuhamba.
But tomorrow he would do better.	Kodwa kusasa wayeza kwenza ngcono.
I will have to think about this more.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngale nto ngakumbi.
We want you there with us.	Sifuna wena apho kunye nathi.
Your mind.	Ingqondo yakho.
This is not the case at all.	Oku akunjalo kwaphela.
He is smarter than I am now.	Ukrelekrele kunam ngoku.
Nobody goes to prison.	Akukho mntu uya entolongweni.
Again, this time he was not alone.	Kwakhona, ngeli xesha wayengekho yedwa.
That is my letter.	Yiyo ke ileta yam.
This is almost not what you want to do.	Oku phantse ayisiyiyo le nto ufuna ukuyenza.
I think I am alone.	Ndicinga ukuba ndedwa.
When he arrives on time.	Xa efika ngexesha.
I hope you can do it !.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza !.
He looks very, very good.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu kakhulu.
It is impossible to talk to him.	Akunakwenzeka ukuthetha naye.
Thanks for seeing you again.	Enkosi kwakhona ukubona kwakhona.
You look like you have it.	Ukhangeleka ngathi unayo.
You really look forward to it.	Ngenene ujonge phambili kuloo nto.
I told her, too.	Ndamxelela, nam.
It will be one or all of the other.	Iya kuba yinto enye okanye yonke enye.
I mean all day.	Ndithetha imini yonke.
So he said nothing.	Ngoko ke akazange athethe nto.
It's the same thing.	Yinto efanayo efanayo.
And that would be a very good thing.	Kwaye oko kunokuba yinto entle kakhulu.
And it wasn't easy.	Kwaye kwakungekho lula.
I want you to do this so that you can be yourself again.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze oku ukuze ube nguwe kwakhona.
My son has gone out.	Unyana wam uye waphuma.
Finding a doctor.	Ukufumana ugqirha.
And there are many more.	Kwaye kukho ezininzi ngakumbi.
Yes, you did.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo uphumelele.
I don't want another one.	Andifuni enye.
I really don't like this.	Andiyithandi ncam le nto.
I think we should go.	Ndicinga ukuba sihambe.
But look at you and me.	Kodwa jonga mna nawe.
Then he went into the bedroom.	Emva koko wangena egumbini lokulala.
And a night walk.	Kwaye ukuhamba ebusuku.
I only came once.	Ndifike kanye kuphela.
There is always time.	Kuhlala kukho ixesha.
Anything that comes to me.	Nantoni na eza kum.
I want to find my way.	Ndifuna ukufumana indlela yam.
At that point there is a problem.	Ngelo xesha kukho ingxaki.
He talked a lot to me.	Wayethetha kakhulu kum.
I want you to come as soon as possible.	Ndifuna ukuba uze ngokukhawuleza.
I want to build one.	Ndifuna sakhe enye.
I want everyone out here.	Ndifuna wonke umntu apha phandle.
But it only happened once.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
He likes to do it outside.	Uyathanda ukuyenza ngaphandle.
But not in the car together, now.	Kodwa hayi emotweni kunye, ngoku.
He does not want to.	Akafuni.
Not before.	Hayi ngaphambi koko.
It's better in the hospital.	Kungcono esibhedlele.
Anything small.	Nantoni na encinci .
It's hard to say which one.	Kunzima ukuthetha ukuba yeyiphi.
I hope to talk to you soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
This book too.	Le ncwadi nayo.
Now he said all the time.	Ngoku wathi ngalo lonke ixesha.
And it is not necessary.	Kwaye akuyomfuneko.
I finally feel better.	Ekugqibeleni ndiziva ngcono.
Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba kunjalo.
This one is not out.	Lo akakho ngaphandle.
I will be on top.	Ndiza kuba phezulu.
Now the window is ready.	Ngoku ifestile ilungile.
That is good for you.	Oko kulungile kuwe.
Now there is a story.	Ngoku kukho ibali.
I mean, this morning.	Ndithetha, ngale ntsasa.
It's not one thing or another.	Asiyonto enye okanye enye.
I'll come to that again.	Ndiya kuza kuloo nto kwakhona.
Everything is fine now.	Yonke into ilungile ngoku.
Very little money.	Imali encinci kakhulu.
He had to go alone.	Bekufanele ahambe yedwa.
You feel interesting.	Uziva unomdla.
But too much money.	Kodwa imali eninzi kakhulu.
You will have plenty of time to do that.	Uya kuba nexesha elininzi lokwenza oko.
Never.	Soze .
You have to do that every day.	Kufuneka wenze oko yonke imihla.
For both of us.	Yethu sobabini.
Something big is going to happen.	Kukho into enkulu eza kwenzeka.
I'm happy.	Ndiyavuya mna.
That is not necessary, however.	Oko akuyomfuneko, nangona kunjalo.
There was no other way but him.	Kwakungekho enye indlela ngaphandle kwakhe.
I do not fully understand.	Andiqondi ngokupheleleyo.
I want us all to be there.	Ndifuna sonke sibe lapho.
Your doctor right away.	Ugqirha wakho ngoko nangoko.
It could be here.	Inokuba njalo apha.
Yes it is.	Ewe, yiyo.
John spoke very slowly.	UJohn wathetha kancinci kakhulu.
Then, there is the voice.	Emva koko, kukho ilizwi.
Your best bet is to do something new.	Indlela yakho engcono kukwenza into entsha.
The problem is that this happens only once.	Ingxaki kukuba oku kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
But yes, that did happen.	Kodwa ewe, oko kwenzeka.
His work here is very good.	Umsebenzi wakhe apha mhle kakhulu.
There was no reason to have it all.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba nayo yonke loo nto.
Sure, it's hard.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kunzima.
And they said, well.	Kwaye bathi, kulungile.
And then what.	Kwaye emva koko yintoni .
It would be late for me.	Bekuya kuba mva kum.
This one, however, seems a little out of place.	Lo, nangona kunjalo, ubonakala kancinci.
He said, what do you want.	Wathi, ufuna ntoni.
He is going home.	Uya ekhaya.
Trying to get better.	Ukuzama ukuba ngcono.
My mother thought he was a good child.	Umama wayecinga ukuba ngumntwana olungileyo.
Then you want to talk.	Emva koko ufuna ukuthetha.
But he is leaving soon.	Kodwa uza kuhamba kungekudala.
What are you going to do now?	Uza kwenza ntoni ngoku.
Well, no, it's not.	Ewe, hayi, akunjalo.
Moreover, he thought.	Ngaphezu koko, wacinga.
It will be wonderful for us to be together again.	Kuya kuba mnandi kuthi ukuba kunye kwakhona.
But not because of him.	Kodwa hayi ngenxa yakhe.
So he went to prison.	Ngoko waya entolongweni.
You, though.	Wena, nangona kunjalo.
But you know better now.	Kodwa uyazi ngcono ngoku.
I can't wait here.	Andikwazi kulinda apha.
Nobody wants to go first.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuya kuqala.
I will make peace.	ndiya kwenza uxolo.
A really great person.	Umntu omkhulu ngokwenene.
I've never seen him do this before.	Andizange ndimbone esenza ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
All his life he lived alone.	Ubomi bakhe wayehlala yedwa.
I never got anywhere there.	Andizange ndifike ndawo apho.
I have to learn to be who I am again.	Kufuneka ndifunde ukuba ndim kwakhona.
Now we know how that happened.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
This is his job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wakhe.
Where you go and when and how much you spend.	Apho uya khona kwaye nini kwaye uchitha kangakanani.
In the office this morning.	Eofisini ngale ntsasa.
I never thought this could really happen.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I think you should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube nayo.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akufanele.
That's what it means to just sit.	Nantso into ethetha ukuhlala nje.
Finding a way.	Ukufumana indlela.
Stop being busy.	Yeka ukuhlala uxakekile.
But you can't be human right now.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuba ngumntu okwangoku.
And you read regularly.	Kwaye ufunda rhoqo.
You look tired.	Ubonakala ngathi udiniwe.
I will be with you.	Ndiza kuba nawe.
Then we went to another.	Emva koko siye komnye.
I've traveled enough.	Ndihambe ngokwaneleyo.
We all want more money.	Sonke sifuna imali eninzi.
But then he would be.	Kodwa ke wayeza kuba njalo.
But my son.	Kodwa unyana wam.
All that out.	Yonke loo nto ngaphandle.
You can't say this.	Awukwazi ukuthetha oku.
Then you go downtown.	Emva koko uhambe edolophini.
There is no such person.	Akukho mntu unjalo.
That's it for me.	Yiloo nto kum.
Please what is wrong with it.	Nceda yintoni engalunganga ngayo.
This will be really fun.	Oku kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
Not so and for both of us.	Akunjalo kwaye sobabini.
I'm sure it's just a small thing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yinto nje encinci.
The music goes very well.	Umculo uhamba kakuhle kakhulu.
This is a big job.	Lo ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
Well, let's go far.	Ke ewe, sihambe kude.
Not so this week.	Akunjalo kule veki.
Improved music.	Wenze ngcono umculo.
And so are many children.	Kwaye kunjalo nabantwana abaninzi.
He wanted attention.	Wayefuna ingqalelo.
Sooner or later it will happen.	Kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kwenzeka.
This is already going on.	Oku sele kuqhubeka.
Traveling alone is difficult.	Ukuhamba wedwa kunzima.
Self-control is one thing.	Ukuzibamba yinto enye.
I love it that way, though.	Ndiyayithanda ngolo hlobo, nangona kunjalo.
I tried to talk to her.	Ndazama ukuthetha nayo.
And he wants you.	Kwaye ufuna wena.
It seems to us, perhaps.	Kubonakala ngathi, mhlawumbi.
I am here to do his work.	Ndilapha ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
Maybe another week.	Mhlawumbi enye iveki.
It may be time now.	Inokuba lixesha ngoku.
Or with it.	Okanye ngayo.
I mean swim in it.	Ndithetha ukuqubha kuyo.
Please tell me more !.	Ndicela undixelele ngakumbi!.
Now she has looked back.	Ngoku uye wajonga ngasemva.
I know it is impossible.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I've always wanted to do.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukwenza.
Your time.	Ixesha lakho.
He told me that.	Wandixelela ukuba .
Now, you think, you can be very sad.	Ngoku, ucinga ukuba, unokuba buhlungu kakhulu.
He's here all the time, too.	Ulapha ngalo lonke ixesha, naye.
And that is not really the case.	Kwaye akunjalo ngokwenene.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Mhlawumbi le yinto enkulu.
He said he would be down.	Wathi uzakuba phantsi.
And he did not agree.	Kwaye akazange avume.
He did not want her to come.	Wayengafuni ukuba eze.
And this is for him.	Kwaye oku kuye.
Finally he began to speak.	Ekugqibeleni waqalisa ukuthetha.
So he ran away.	Ngoko wabaleka.
Well, he used to be, right.	Ewe, wayedla ngokuba njalo, kunjalo.
He does this every day.	Wenza ngale nto yonke imihla.
You have to do it alone.	Kufuneka uyenze wedwa.
He ran away with it.	Wabaleka nayo.
If you do not know what it is, you should.	Ukuba awuyazi ukuba yintoni na, kufuneka.
I feel like myself again.	Ndiziva njengam kwakhona.
He did not want to be alone.	Wayengafuni nokuba yedwa.
He told her to do so.	Wamxelela ukuba enze njalo.
I may have done something wrong.	Inokuba ndenze into engalunganga.
He did not know how long he would have to wait.	Wayengazi ukuba wayeza kuba nexesha elingakanani na.
But you do not want to be here.	Kodwa awufuni ukuba lapha.
It really seems like a big deal to me.	Ngokwenene kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu kum.
Soon he would succeed.	Kungekudala wayeza kuphumelela.
I know you too.	Ndiyakwazi nawe.
Or, maybe I'm the only one.	Okanye, mhlawumbi ndim kuphela.
You know there was nobody here.	Uyazi ukuba kwakungekho mntu apha.
But perhaps that was not necessary.	Kodwa mhlawumbi oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
Why, look here.	Kutheni, jonga apha.
I had never thought of that before.	Andizange ndicinge ngolo hlobo ngaphambili.
What's the matter with me? 	Yintoni ingxaki kum?
He never told me that, somebody told me.	Akazange andixelele loo nto, omnye umntu wandixelela.
Someone needs permission.	Umntu ufuna imvume.
No, far away.	Hayi, kude.
Everyone knows everything.	Wonke umntu wazi yonke into.
He quickly looked at the big picture.	Wajonga ngokukhawuleza umfanekiso omkhulu.
This is certainly not possible.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
I do not want to see.	Andifuni ukubona.
That will make it harder.	Oko kuya kwenza kube nzima.
I do.	ndenza njalo.
It may have been a good thing he did.	Inokuba yinto entle ayenzileyo.
I will make a speech '.	Ndiza kwenza intetho'.
He picked up the phone.	Uye wathatha ifowuni.
But he did not want to stay.	Kodwa akazange afune ukuhlala.
Do not work your life.	Musa ukwenza umsebenzi ubomi bakho.
I'm waiting for the doctor.	Ndilinde ugqirha .
I really want your answer.	Ndifuna ngokwenene impendulo yakho.
In the end he did not succeed.	Ekugqibeleni akazange aphumelele.
That is the only thing that happened.	Yiloo nto kuphela eyenzekayo.
I do everything.	Ndiyenza yonke into.
She is trying to do things herself.	Uzama ukwenza izinto ngokwakhe.
Now that would be a big deal.	Ngoku oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu.
He didn't think much of it.	Akazange acinge kakhulu ngayo.
I'm not sure what happened at the moment.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngeli xesha.
Just because you have to.	Kuba nje kufuneka.
And clearly it wasn’t.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo yayingenguye.
But no one is like that.	Kodwa akukho mntu unjalo.
So, wrong.	Ngoko, engalunganga.
It should be really fun to do.	Kufuneka kube mnandi ngokwenene ukwenza.
You really are.	Wena ngokwenene .
And it will happen again.	Kwaye kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
And there is something about him.	Kwaye kukho into ethile ngaye.
He can do this alone.	Uyakwazi ukwenjenjalo xa eyedwa.
Really, very.	Ngokwenene, kakhulu.
He opened the window.	Uye wavula ifestile.
I'm not sure how he did that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wayenza njani loo nto.
Yes, it will be painful.	Ewe, kuya kuba buhlungu.
I have done too much.	Ndenze kakhulu kakhulu.
Very few.	Abanye kakhulu.
But you don't have to go with me.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhambe nam.
Who wants to do that ?.	Ngubani ofuna ukuyenza lonto?.
He will do anything to succeed.	Uya kwenza nantoni na ukuze aphumelele.
But it is you.	Kodwa nguwe.
She’s very sure about him, maybe.	Uqinisekile kakhulu ngaye, mhlawumbi.
One has to eat.	Umntu kufuneka atye.
So he can't do that.	Ngoko akanakuyenza loo nto.
Word first.	Ilizwi kuqala.
It certainly is not a problem to do so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ngxaki ukwenza oko.
No, not really.	Hayi, akunjalo, ngokwenene.
He said it was impossible.	Wathi akunakwenzeka.
Can you do it?	Ngaba ungayenza?
And not just his life.	Kwaye hayi ubomi bakhe kuphela.
What you need to do.	Yintoni ekufuneka uyenzile.
I want you to tell me what happened.	Ndifuna undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But you need to know this.	Kodwa kufuneka ukwazi oku.
He loves everything beautiful and everything unusual.	Uthanda yonke into entle nayo yonke into engaqhelekanga.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ncam ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Succeeding is not easy.	Ukuphumelela akukho lula.
Now we will see.	Ngoku siza kubona.
The doctor is here.	Ugqirha ulapha.
You will eat from me.	Uya kutya kum.
He has to go to work.	Kufuneka aye emsebenzini.
No one at this time, however.	Akukho mntu ngeli xesha, nangona kunjalo.
But there is something.	Kodwa kukho into.
It is difficult, and very long.	Kunzima, kwaye ixesha elide kakhulu.
I wanted to be away from him too.	Nam ndandifuna ukuba kude kuye.
Great message for all of us.	Umyalezo omkhulu kuthi sonke.
You think everyone should be like you.	Ucinga ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka abe njengawe.
But always for me.	Kodwa rhoqo kum.
He almost fell asleep.	Uphantse walala.
But they both sat down.	Kodwa bobabini bahlala phantsi.
Do not go alone.	Musa ukuhamba wedwa.
And he certainly is.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo unjalo.
I am going to town tomorrow.	Ndiya edolophini ngomso.
You talk to him.	Uthetha naye.
Not a big meeting.	Hayi intlanganiso enkulu.
This is my place.	Indawo yam ke.
We'll talk about that again later.	Siza kuthetha ngayo kwakhona kamva.
He was living with us at the time.	Wayehlala nathi ngelo xesha.
My fault .	Ngenxa yam .
See what's going on with me.	Jonga ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni kum.
I'm not sure that would be better.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba oko kuya kuba ngcono.
There would always be something of his there.	Bekuya kuhlala kukho into yakhe apho.
Everyone has a problem.	Wonke umntu unengxaki ethile.
Very, very alone.	Kakhulu, wedwa kakhulu.
I will buy it again.	Ndiza kuthenga kwakhona.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
And that's a good thing.	Kwaye ke yinto entle leyo.
It takes too much time.	Kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu.
Yes, why, yes.	Ewe, kutheni, ewe.
This is a big man.	Yindoda enkulu le.
I finally saw something.	Ekugqibeleni ndabona into ethile.
But the police want to talk to you.	Kodwa amapolisa afuna ukuthetha nawe.
Why, you already know.	Kutheni, sele uyazi.
I hope you stay long enough to do that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhlala ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo ukwenza oko.
Please tell me what I did.	Nceda undixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
If he is not present, there is no danger.	Ukuba akakho, akukho ngozi.
We know a few more things if not.	Siyazi ezinye izinto ezimbalwa ngakumbi ukuba akunjalo.
I can sing, too.	Ndiyakwazi ukucula, nam.
Not even that hard.	Hayi nokuba kunzima kakhulu.
But not only that.	Kodwa hayi kuphela.
It will all come soon.	Konke kuya kuza ngokukhawuleza.
That is the case so far.	Oko kunjalo kude kube ngoku.
Now, through our work.	Ngoku, ngomsebenzi wethu.
We want him to help us.	Sifuna ukuba asincede.
It shouldn't have happened, of course.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba yenzeke, kunjalo.
All right, until dinner then.	Kulungile, kude kube isidlo sangokuhlwa ngoko.
He fell asleep, fell asleep immediately.	Walala, walala kwangoko.
We want to play well.	Sifuna ukudlala kakuhle.
Just something about you.	Into nje ngawe.
Sorry, but that's true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani leyo.
Another place though.	Enye indawo nangona.
I have never been able to do that before.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto ngaphambili.
She is very confident about you, but not others.	Uqinisekile kakhulu ngawe, kodwa hayi abanye.
Not everything is so bad, of course.	Ayisiyiyo yonke into embi kangako, kunjalo.
But not for him.	Kodwa hayi kuye.
You want to do well.	Ufuna ukwenza kakuhle.
I look forward to playing this more.	Ndijonge phambili ukudlala oku ngakumbi.
Okay, that's right, but it's hard.	Kulungile, kunjalo, kodwa kunzima.
You do not really want to do this.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwenza oku.
He is definitely going to jail, as it should be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya entolongweni, njengoko kufuneka.
Thanks again for your time.	Enkosi kwakhona ngexesha lakho.
He thought you were too.	Wacinga ukuba nawe unjalo.
Later that evening.	Kamva ngaloo ngokuhlwa.
Now you have to decide what you want to do.	Ngoku kufuneka wenze isigqibo malunga nokuba ufuna ukwenza ntoni.
But the children have to go to school.	Kodwa abantwana kufuneka baye esikolweni.
However, it is not mandatory.	Nangona kunjalo, akunyanzelekanga.
At that time many.	Ngelo xesha abaninzi.
I think it could be.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba njalo.
Later, that did not happen.	Kamva, akuzange kube njalo.
Then there is the gradual process.	Emva koko kukho kancinci kancinci.
Well, you can do this.	Kulungile, ungayenza le nto.
If there is no need for it, yes.	Ukuba akukho mfuneko kuyo, ewe.
I did not know how long it would take.	Ndandingazi ukuba iza kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
The door, he thought.	Ucango, wacinga.
A toy.	Into yokudlala.
You play very hard.	Udlala nzima kakhulu.
I know you love her very much.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyamthanda kakhulu.
Many of me.	Abaninzi bam.
Obviously I did it again.	Kucacile ukuba ndiyenzile kwakhona.
Or now in the evening.	Okanye ngoku ngokuhlwa.
It should be fun to read.	Kufuneka kube mnandi ukufunda.
He certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile.
And you really mean that.	Kwaye ngokwenene uthetha ukuba.
Now we will come back again.	Ngoku siza kubuya kwakhona.
Are you busy?.	Ingaba uxakekile?.
Suddenly everyone is right for you.	Ngokukhawuleza wonke umntu ulungile kuwe.
You have to be in this for a long time.	Kufuneka ube kule nto ixesha elide.
I'm not sure what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze ntoni.
You will be scared though.	Uyoyika kodwa.
You know, that's not all.	Uyazi, ayinguye kwaphela lowo.
He tried but could not.	Wazama kodwa akakwazi.
I learned a lot more.	Ndifunde kakhulu ngakumbi.
I want to help, though.	Ndifuna ukunceda, nangona kunjalo.
I will not be !.	Andiyi kuba!.
Just look ahead.	Jonga phambili kuphela.
One day you have to go to prison.	Ngenye imini kufuneka uye entolongweni.
I don't know what you really want to do.	Andazi ukuba ufuna ukwenza ntoni kanye kanye.
Maybe he shouldn't have said that.	Mhlawumbi bekungafanelanga athethe loo nto.
I have to make it easy.	Kufuneka ndiyenze lula.
You can't even.	Awukwazi nokuba.
Going with him.	Ukuhamba naye.
He is gone now.	Uhambe ngoku.
And now you do, too.	Kwaye ngoku wenza, nawe.
We all want the same thing.	Sonke sifuna into enye.
He would try everything.	Wayeza kuzama ngayo yonke into.
I have to go the other way to work.	Kufuneka ndihambe ngenye indlela ukuya emsebenzini.
Someone wants to do that.	Umntu ufuna ukwenza oko.
Again no time.	Kwakhona akukho xesha.
I think either way is fine.	Ndicinga ukuba nayiphi na indlela ilungile.
I think this is impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
After lunch then.	Emva kwesidlo sasemini ngoko.
I too have made a plan.	Nam ndiyenzile icebo.
Not up.	Hayi phezulu.
But he told the truth.	Kodwa wathetha inyaniso.
He did not speak to Mother.	Akazange athethe uMama.
And so it is.	Kwaye kunjalo .
Well, that's the problem.	Ewe, nantso ingxaki.
Exactly how, he did not know.	Kanye ukuba njani, wayengazi.
Because he was talking only about himself.	Kuba wayethetha ngaye kuphela.
Then you have succeeded.	Emva koko uphumelele.
I realized that I needed help.	Ndabona ukuba ndifuna uncedo.
We did things right.	Senze izinto kakuhle.
My work here has done it.	Umsebenzi wam apha uyenzile.
I don't see one thing.	Andiboni nto enye.
His eyes are very wide.	Amehlo akhe kakhulu.
But something is needed.	Kodwa kufuneka into.
But he did not know how.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuba njani.
I don't want to come back tonight.	Andifuni kubuya ngokuhlwanje.
And it will only take one.	Kwaye kuya kuthatha enye kuphela.
He is ready to be that way.	Ukulungele ukuba njalo.
I sit, in bed.	Ndihlala, ebhedini.
When he arrived, there was nothing.	Wafika, kwakungekho nto.
You just have to do it really well.	Kufuneka nje wenze kakuhle ngokwenene.
He didn't know what to think of anything.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni ngayo nayiphi na into.
You have money somewhere.	Unayo imali kwindawo ethile.
But that was not the case.	Kodwa ukuba kwakungekho.
I do not have to stay long.	Akufunekanga ndihlale ixesha elide.
I have to do this myself.	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngokwam le nto.
You may have read and traveled a lot.	Usenokuba wafunda waza wahamba kakhulu.
There is something wrong with all of this, too.	Kukho into engalunganga ngayo yonke le nto, kwaye .
It will take work.	Kuya kuthatha umsebenzi.
He wants a marriage.	Ufuna umtshato.
As you want.	Njengoko ufuna.
And they will certainly last a long time.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuhlala ixesha elide.
It can be a small thing.	Inokuba yinto encinci.
Coming again.	Ukuza kwakhona.
I knew it was impossible.	Ndandisazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
If not, then something better is going to happen!	Ukuba akunjalo, kuthetha ukuba into engcono iya kwenzeka!
How long, he does not know.	Ixesha elingakanani, akazi.
I will do well.	Ndiza kuyenza kakuhle.
Well that's not exactly the case.	Kulungile oko akunjalo ncam.
He saw something else then, too.	Wabona enye into ngoko, naye.
He certainly does not like that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo umele ukuba akayithandi loo nto.
But this is not the case and it should not be.	Kodwa oku akunjalo kwaye akufanele kube njalo.
No one does this.	Akukho mntu wenza oku.
I'm afraid, if you need to know the truth.	Ndiyoyika, ukuba kufuneka uyazi inyaniso.
Or maybe now.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngoku.
No one thought it would happen.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Driving here is very difficult.	Ukuqhuba apha kunzima kakhulu.
You are afraid that you know too much.	Uyoyika ukuba wazi kakhulu.
This does happen, however.	Oku kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
You know you did too.	Uyazi nawe uyenzile.
Good, both of them.	Mhle, bobabini.
I wanted to stay there with him all night.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala apho naye ubusuku bonke.
I just want to be with you.	Ndifuna nje ukuba nawe.
The best place.	Indawo engcono kakhulu.
Others live longer.	Abanye bahlala ixesha elide.
But the truth is, he did not.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba, akazange.
He loves making music.	Uthanda ukwenza umculo.
But then he started.	Kodwa ke waqalisa.
I will go a little further at first.	Ndiza kuhamba kancinci ekuqaleni.
But I'm not sure how I can do that.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Will we go further.	Ngaba siza kuya phambili.
Someone is making this happen.	Kukho umntu owenza oku kwenzeke.
I asked for money.	Ndacela imali.
And, yes, he wasn't pretty with her.	Kwaye, ewe, wayengekho mhle naye.
You have to go.	Kufuneka uhambe .
And there really is no way.	Kwaye ngokwenene akukho ndlela.
And they will certainly be.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuba njalo.
Mistake to take this job.	Impazamo ukuthatha lo msebenzi.
I'm sure it's okay.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ilungile.
Lots of stuff, really.	Izinto ezininzi, ngokwenene.
What is happening now.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
You know, here, with me.	Uyazi, apha, kunye nam.
It's getting better, of course.	Kuba ngcono, kunjalo.
Thanks again!.	Enkosi kwakhona!.
But this seems like all or nothing.	Kodwa oku kubonakala ngathi konke okanye akukho nto.
He looked at her a few times.	Wajonga kuye izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
It just so happens that the problem is you.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba ingxaki nguwe.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba kunjalo.
I am very aware of this.	Ndiyazi kakhulu le nto.
So thank you very much, very much.	Ngoko enkosi kakhulu, kakhulu.
Then nothing happens, or nothing seems to happen.	Emva koko akukho nto eyenzekayo, okanye kubonakala ngathi akukho nto eyenzekayo.
I was not far behind.	Khange ndibe kudala emva.
He also said nothing.	Naye akazange athethe nto.
But he did not look good.	Kodwa wayengabonakali kakuhle.
If so, then.	Ukuba kunjalo, ngoko.
You will need to come and look at this.	Kuya kufuneka uze kwaye ujonge oku.
He came to me.	Uze kum.
I have to be real here.	Kufuneka ndibe nyani apha.
You are so good to me like that.	Ulungile kum ngolo hlobo.
So off he went.	Wahamba ke wahamba.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngomso.
If you want to get out of there money.	Ukuba ufuna ukuphuma apho imali.
Not now, and not yet.	Hayi ngoku, kwaye hayi okwangoku.
Some children are sitting in the car.	Abanye abantwana bahlala emotweni.
This is exactly what he did.	Yile nto kanye ayenzileyo.
Then earlier.	Emva koko ngaphambili.
That would be nice though.	Oko bekuya kuba kuhle nangona kunjalo.
We know that happens very often.	Siyazi ukuba oko kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
He almost immediately agreed.	Uphantse wavuma ngoko nangoko.
It can also be more difficult.	Kwakhona kunokuba nzima ngakumbi.
Now, everything is fine.	Ngoku, yonke into ilungile.
I can't do without you.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakho.
One day he received a strange letter.	Ngenye imini wafumana ileta engaqhelekanga.
I will have a drink.	Ndiza kufumana utywala.
He looked up again.	Wajonga kwakhona.
And not just a little bit up.	Kwaye hayi nje kancinci phezulu.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke ilungile.
It will make your job easier.	Iya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula.
He took off his shirt.	Wakhupha ihempe yakhe.
I just want to say one word to you.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha ilizwi elinye kuwe.
Do not steal books.	Musa ukuba iincwadi.
Even if you are just interested in it.	Nokuba unomdla nje ngayo.
However, it is not too difficult to read.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nzima kakhulu ukufunda.
There are others.	Kukho abanye.
And no one ever entered my house.	Kwaye akukho mntu wakha wangena endlwini yam.
So you will definitely never do it again.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo awuyi kuphinda.
Home help or something like that.	Uncedo endlini okanye into enjalo.
I talked a lot, a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu, kakhulu.
It is difficult for me to stay in that situation.	Kunzima kum ukuhlala kule meko.
You may be older.	Usenokuba mdala.
You do not want friends.	Awufuni abahlobo.
Nothing is going to be easy.	Akukho nto iza lula.
He didn’t do that, though.	Akazange akwenze oko, nangona kunjalo.
Think about everything.	Ucinge ngayo yonke into.
A few days, maybe.	Iintsuku ezimbalwa, mhlawumbi.
So first do that.	Ngoko kuqala wenze loo nto.
It can be painful.	Inokuba buhlungu.
It is even harder to say that.	Kunzima ngakumbi ukuthetha kunjalo.
So very wrong.	Ngoko engalunganga kakhulu.
It has to be so and so.	Kufuneka kube njalo kwaye njalo.
So he says it's okay.	Ngoko uthi kulungile.
I feel like you.	Ndiziva njengawe.
No one thinks about this.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngale nto.
Everyone is looking at him.	Wonke umntu ujonge kuye.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, ukhona nje.
I will be here all the time.	Ndiza kuba lapha lonke ixesha.
It is good to work together.	Kuhle ukusebenza kunye.
I can't do all that myself.	Andikwazi kuyenza yonke lonto mna.
And to see the place.	Kwaye ukubona indawo.
And back again.	Kwaye emva kwakhona.
It should have been high.	Bekufanele ukuba phezulu.
Everyone agreed.	Wonke umntu wavuma.
Mary sat for a while.	UMariya wahlala kancinci.
I am here in the park.	Ndilapha epakini.
I never got there.	Andizange ndifike apho.
He thought he didn't like the place.	Wayecinga ukuba akayithandi le ndawo.
He would do it alone.	Wayeza kuyenza loo nto yedwa.
However, you will have to wait.	Nangona kunjalo, kuya kufuneka ulinde.
But he certainly would like to try.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo angathanda ukuzama.
It wasn’t, but he didn’t know it.	Kwakungekho, kodwa wayengazi ukuba.
He does everything and he does it very well.	Wenza yonke into kwaye uyenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Not ahead of time at all.	Hayi phambi kwexesha konke konke.
We did not leave.	Asizange sihambe.
Girl even.	Intombi nokuba.
No one has done much.	Akukho mntu wenze into eninzi.
This is always difficult.	Oku kuhlala kunzima.
I feel so much better.	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu.
Really great job.	Umsebenzi omkhulu ngokwenene.
Going to that.	Ukuya kuloo nto.
He always knew.	Ngalo lonke ixesha wayesazi.
It seemed obvious to him.	Kwakubonakala kucacile kuye.
Is it so hard ?.	Ngaba kunzima kangaka?.
Then you will continue.	Emva koko uya kuqhubeka.
You know the truth.	Uyayazi inyani.
Make some pretty good money, too.	Yenziwe imali entle kakhulu, nayo.
He did it, he took it.	Uyenzile, wathatha.
Our job is to make it happen first.	Umsebenzi wethu kukwenza ukuba kwenzeke kuqala.
However, he knew better than to speak.	Nangona kunjalo, wayesazi ngcono kunokuba athethe.
However, he does not have to.	Kodwa ke, akuyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I now .	Mna ngoku .
Finally he entered.	Ekugqibeleni wangena.
I will certainly not do that.	ngokuqinisekileyo andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
I can't get there.	Andikwazi kufika apho.
He knew everything was fine now.	Wayesazi ukuba yonke into ilungile ngoku.
See if there is anything there.	Jonga ukuba kukho nantoni na apho.
He would do anything.	Wayeza kwenza nantoni na.
But, he must succeed.	Kodwa, kufuneka aphumelele.
You know that, too.	Uyazi ukuba kunjalo, nawe.
Then wait outside.	Emva koko ulinde ngaphandle.
In this, he did not succeed.	Kule nto, akazange aphumelele.
You want more of my time.	Ufuna ixesha lam elininzi.
He knew something was going to happen to him.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka kuye.
Maybe we'll get another one.	Mhlawumbi siza kufumana enye.
And better, faster.	Kwaye ngcono, ngokukhawuleza.
He said he knew about it, too.	Uthe uyazi ngayo, nawe.
Please drive.	Nceda ukuqhuba.
No one heard anything.	Akukho mntu weva nto.
Maybe she likes it too.	Mhlawumbi naye uyayithanda.
I personally love it.	Mna ngokwam ndiyayithanda.
It could be him.	Inokuba naye.
I never thought about it before.	Andizange ndikhe ndicinge ngayo ngaphambili.
Only when more money is needed immediately.	Kuphela xa kufuneka imali eninzi ngokukhawuleza.
How strange all this.	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo yonke le nto.
That's all.	Yonke ke loo nto.
I will never speak.	Soze ndithethe.
I do not want you to be alone.	Andifuni ube wedwa.
And if so, how much.	Kwaye ukuba kunjalo, kangakanani.
So much for me.	Kakhulu kum.
He really knew.	Wayesazi ngokwenene.
He did not come alone.	Akazange eze yedwa.
You're not thinking right now.	Awucingi kakuhle ngoku.
And we have to be tough.	Kwaye kufuneka sibe nzima.
A new man came home.	Wafika ekhaya umntu omtsha.
He spoke to her.	Wathetha kuyo.
What will happen, will happen.	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni, kuya kwenzeka.
Just don’t know enough to do the job well.	Musa nje ukwazi ngokwaneleyo ukwenza umsebenzi kakuhle.
I'll be back soon.	Ndiza kufika kungekudala.
He lives right there.	Uhlala kanye apho.
We've traveled a long way since then.	Sihambe ngoku kude ukusukela ngoko.
Maybe that's true now.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo ngoku.
I told her all this.	Ndamxelela yonke lento.
It's hard to eat.	Kunzima ukutya.
It is very difficult to tell.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuxelela.
Nobody ever did it.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu kuyo yonke into.
That's just yours.	Yinto yakho nje leyo.
And I need help.	Kwaye ndifuna uncedo.
But no, no, everything is fine.	Kodwa hayi, hayi, yonke into ilungile.
I think that will happen.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
That's strange, he thought.	Yinto engaqhelekanga leyo, wacinga.
Yes, we have to move fast.	Ewe, kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
I will definitely be back.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kubuya.
There is always something going on.	Kuhlala kukho into eyenzekayo.
This is what he wants for us now.	Yile nto ayifunayo kuthi ngoku.
But he did not want to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Everyone knows about it.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngayo.
Nobody wants to work there.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukusebenza apho.
he did not go to work.	khange aye emsebenzini.
There is no reason for you to be.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ube.
His wife alone.	Umfazi wakhe yedwa.
They will certainly be able to see through me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kukwazi ukubona ngam.
I don't want it to happen.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke.
It's your time.	Lixesha lakho.
This creates a problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki.
But we will not talk about it.	Kodwa asiyi kuthetha ngayo.
What would happen if.	Bekuya kwenzeka ntoni ukuba .
Well, about it.	Kulungile, malunga nayo.
Yeah, me, no.	Ewe, mna, hayi.
They'll come back, and they'll come back again.	Baza kubuya, kwaye baya kubuya kwakhona.
Everything and everything.	Yonke into kunye nantoni na.
He started, and so did he.	Waqalisa, kwaye naye.
It will be better to try.	Kuya kuba ngcono ukuzama.
I never did any of that.	Andizange ndiyenze nayiphi na loo nto.
So for me, this is not the case.	Ke kum, oku akunjalo.
I always live there.	Ndihlala ndihlala apho.
Therefore, it takes a lot of time.	Ngoko ke, kufuna ixesha elininzi.
I was wondering what it was.	Bendicinga nokuba yintoni na.
You will find your way now.	Uya kufumana indlela yakho ngoku.
Like me, once.	Njengam, kanye.
There are so many things out there.	Kukho izinto ezininzi phaya.
Maybe you think it's too good to be true.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba ube yinyani.
I think everything is fine.	Ndicinga ukuba yonke into ilungile.
He returned to work immediately.	Wabuyela emsebenzini ngoko nangoko.
He had better be alone.	Kungcono abe yedwa.
I need your help.	Ndicela uncedo lwakho.
I did not want to die like that.	Ndandingafuni ukufa ngolo hlobo.
Maybe he wanted to be alone.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
I don't know what you did with that money.	Andazi ukuba wenze ntoni ngaloo mali.
He did not make one person.	Akenzanga mntu omnye.
There was no one.	Kwakungekho namnye.
I can't tell you anything else right now.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela enye into ngoku.
We will be fine.	Siza kuhamba kakuhle.
Here or there.	Apha okanye phaya.
I don't remember his name yet.	Andikhumbuli igama lakhe okwangoku.
We will do the same.	Siza kwenza njalo ke.
Not nearly enough.	Akukho phantse ngokwaneleyo.
He does this.	Uyayenza le nto.
And his mother understood.	Kwaye umama wakhe waqonda.
He continued my question.	Waqhubeka umbuzo wam.
Doing a lot of things there.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi apho.
But not people.	Kodwa hayi abantu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akayi.
You speak your mind, just like me.	Uthetha ingqondo yakho, njengam nje.
But the name.	Kodwa igama.
That could be the same thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto enye.
Not yesterday, for a long time.	Hayi izolo, ixesha elide.
I never thought of that.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngaloo nto.
And then, there is the truth.	Kwaye ke, kukho inyaniso.
Well yes, you have to be friends with whoever you want.	Kulungile ewe, kufuneka ube ngumhlobo wakhe nabani na ofuna.
Well, he's not there all the time.	Ewe, akakho lonke ixesha.
He was the first to speak.	Waba ngowokuqala ukuthetha.
It's hard, for me, to see how it happens.	Kunzima, kum, ukubona ukuba kwenzeka njani.
We know this is you.	Siyazi ukuba nguwe lo.
He would do the same with her.	Wayeza kwenza njalo naye.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi .
It is your job to do that.	Ngumsebenzi wakho ukwenza oko.
I can't help it though.	Andikwazi ukunceda nangona kunjalo.
He wants to move on.	Ufuna ukuya phambili.
He is coming soon.	Uza ngokukhawuleza.
Again to try.	Kwakhona ukuzama.
You may be busy right now.	Inokuba uxakekile ngoku.
Maybe he didn't want to.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni.
Internal performance.	Ukusebenza ngaphakathi.
Of course it is not easy.	Ewe akukho lula.
He later learned another way.	Kamva wafunda ngenye indlela.
But you are probably tired of him.	Kodwa mhlawumbi udiniwe nguye.
Now it will be time.	Ngoku iya kuba lixesha.
However, you want to do.	Nangona kunjalo, ufuna ukwenza.
He knew he had to do something fast.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka enze into ngokukhawuleza.
While this may be possible, it can be difficult.	Nangona oku kunokwenzeka, kunokuba nzima.
He thought he was thinking of her.	Wayecinga ukuba wayecinga ngaye.
I don't even care if you live there.	Andikhathali nokuba uhlala apho.
Very much looking forward !.	Kakhulu ujonge phambili!.
I hope you like it a little bit.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda kancinci.
I sit down.	Ndihlala phantsi.
And he did a very good job.	Kwaye wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
If you have ever thought of me.	Ukuba ukhe wacinga ngam.
I think of him.	Ndicinga ngaye.
Really this time.	Ngenene ngeli xesha.
And then you will go faster.	Kwaye ke uya kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Then it is more powerful.	Emva koko ngamandla ngakumbi.
He did not want to make any more mistakes.	Wayengafuni ukwenza ezinye iimpazamo.
You know the problem there.	Uyayazi ingxaki apho.
For you.	Ukuze kuwe.
He did just that the other day.	Wenza loo nto kanye ngenye imini.
She would tell her father that she loved him.	Wayeza kumxelela utata wakhe ukuba uyamthanda.
This time everyone came out.	Ngeli xesha wonke umntu waphuma.
Okay, it looks okay.	Kulungile, kubonakala kulungile.
You will need to know what this means for me.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ukuba oku kuthetha ntoni kum.
I am absolutely convinced.	Ndiqinisekile ngokupheleleyo.
However, she did not think about him.	Nangona kunjalo, akazange acinge ngaye.
So he did what he could.	Ngoko wenze konke okusemandleni akhe.
I know for a fact that I did.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ndenze njalo.
We need to go for help.	Kufuneka siye kufuna uncedo.
Yes, this is really possible.	Ewe, oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
It was not after that.	Kwakungekho emva koko.
You do not know how hard it is to walk.	Awuyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani ukuhamba.
Sure, everything is fine.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, yonke into ilungile.
I look forward to meeting you there !.	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana nawe phaya!.
I've been here a long time.	Ndilapha ixesha elide.
That's all he wants to do.	Yinto yonke afuna ukuyenza.
But much has happened so quickly.	Kodwa okuninzi kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
It seemed like something new.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto entsha.
She does very well when she is alone.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu xa eyedwa.
It all happened in one room.	Yonke le nto yenzeke kwigumbi elinye.
That will mean that you know the truth.	Oko kuya kuthetha ukuba uyayazi inyaniso.
Whatever it is and you love it.	Nokuba yintoni na kwaye uyayithanda.
The conclusion is that it is.	Isigqibo kukuba kunjalo.
I knew how, yes.	Ndandisazi ukuba njani, ewe.
It will take three days.	Kuya kuthatha iintsuku ezintathu.
But only you.	Kodwa wena kuphela.
Not just mine, but others'.	Hayi yam kuphela, kodwa abanye '.
It all seemed so hard.	Konke kwakubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
If not today, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, kungekudala.
Whoever you want to be.	Nabani na ofuna ukuba nguye.
Therefore, efficiency will be lower.	Ngoko ke, ukusebenza kakuhle kuya kuba phantsi.
He must have been dead then.	Inokuba wayesele ngoko.
He wanted to succeed quickly.	Wayefuna ukuphumelela ngokukhawuleza.
No one immediately reads that.	Akukho mntu ufunda ngokukhawuleza oko.
But it is not necessary at all.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
You have to be there too.	Kufuneka ube lapho nawe.
He's just talking his mind.	Uthetha nje ingqondo yakhe.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu yonke into.
But this should not be the case with us.	Kodwa oku akufanele kube njalo kuthi.
And it is a very good time.	Kwaye lixesha elihle kakhulu.
No one ever thought it would happen.	Akukho mntu wakha wacinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi kwanto.
I haven't heard anything since.	Khange ndive nto ukusukela oko.
It's all done.	Yenziwe yonke loo nto.
I’ve always been curious, though.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukwazi, nangona kunjalo.
All you have to do is be yourself.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile kukuba nguwe.
It is not necessary here.	Akuyomfuneko apha.
Then he said his father.	Emva koko wathi utata wakhe.
But I did not.	Kodwa andizange.
She reads books all the time.	Ufunda iincwadi ngalo lonke ixesha.
It will come back.	Iza kubuya.
That seemed obvious.	Oko kwakubonakala kucacile.
I do not know.	Andikwazi ukwazi.
We will do more than that.	Siza kwenza ngaphezu koko.
I never really knew.	Andizange ndiyazi ngokwenene.
I don't like him.	Andiyithandi kuye.
So you know.	Ngoko uyazi.
I wanted to make it my home.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza indlu yam.
Just great.	Enkulu nje.
I don’t think it will get better, not immediately.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba ngcono, hayi ngoko nangoko.
You know very well that you have it.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba unayo.
Home man, then.	Umntu wasekhaya, ngoko.
And above all to you.	Kwaye ngaphezu kwakho konke kuwe.
But this time, it seems.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
It can also be easy to be hard on you.	Kwakhona kunokuba lula ukuba nzima kuwe.
Nothing will be easy.	Akukho nto iya kuba lula.
The problem is time.	Ingxaki lixesha.
Now that.	Ngoku ukuba.
I did not speak to him.	khange ndithethe naye.
It will need someone else.	Kuya kufuneka omnye umntu.
And then you go and you go and you go more.	Kwaye ke uhamba kwaye uhamba kwaye uhamba ngakumbi.
You will not see it outside.	Awuyi kubona ngaphandle.
I don’t know everything about anything.	Andazi yonke into malunga nantoni na.
He doesn't look anything like me.	Akabonakali kwanto njengam.
He is lying on top.	Ulele phezulu.
And look at me.	Kwaye ujonge kum.
I know you spoke to her yesterday.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthethe nayo izolo.
But it really is that hard.	Kodwa ngokwenene kunzima ngolo hlobo.
But it is true for us.	Kodwa yinyani kuthi.
So no.	Ngoko ke akukho.
Not all at once.	Akunjalo konke kunye.
As later.	Njengokuba emva kwexesha.
I never left.	Khange ndikhe ndihambe.
I read two this afternoon.	Ndifunde ezimbini ngale njikalanga.
Anyone can do this.	Nabani na angayenza le nto.
Just children, or children.	Abantwana nje, okanye abantwana.
One came down.	Omnye wehla.
He likes to go out and walk.	Uyathanda ukuphuma ahambe.
He did not agree with it.	Akazange avume kuyo.
Why, he wondered.	Kutheni, wazibuza.
She is too old.	Mdala kakhulu.
He says yes to her.	Uthi ewe kuye.
You have to go tonight.	Kufuneka uhambe ngokuhlwanje.
This can be good, and it will be difficult.	Oku kunokuba kuhle, kwaye kuya kuba nzima.
He looked at his cat.	Wajonga ikati yakhe.
I thought you liked it too.	Bendicinga ukuba nawe uyayithanda.
So much for anyone.	Kakhulu nabani na.
I will go again.	Ndiza kuphinda ndihambe.
Surely everyone will do things about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wonke umntu uya kwenza izinto ngaloo nto.
Soon he is gone.	Kungekudala wemka.
She has done well.	Uye wenza kakuhle.
I never did, of course.	Andizange ndiyenze, ngokuqinisekileyo.
That's my baby.	Ngumntwana wam lowo.
Will it last long?	Ngaba iya kuhlala ixesha elide?
You may be fine, though.	Usenokuba ulungile, nangona kunjalo.
I thought so.	Bendicinga ukuba kunjalo .
Now this is a strange thing.	Ngoku le yinto engaqhelekanga.
That's a good thing, she told him.	Yinto entle kakhulu, wamxelela.
You're just wasting your time.	Udlala nje ixesha lakho.
Not years.	Hayi iminyaka.
I have never had anything without you.	Andizange ndibe nantoni na ngaphandle kwakho.
Then tell me something first.	Uze undixelele into kuqala.
He will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka abe.
You just have to go.	Kufuneka uhambe nje.
It's hard.	Kuba kunzima.
And wait.	Kwaye ukulinda .
Yes, that's right your way.	Ewe, ilungile loo ndlela yakho.
Either way, that's a good thing.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, yinto elungileyo.
I can do this.	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza oku.
I want to take a dog.	Ndifuna ukuthatha inja.
But we have to be.	Kodwa sifanele sibe njalo.
But again, at that time it will be everywhere.	Kodwa kwakhona, ngelo xesha iya kuba kuyo yonke indawo.
I don't want to buy now.	Andifuni ukuthenga ngoku.
This is a bad thing to say.	Yinto embi le ukuyithetha.
Inside you feel a little tired.	Ngaphakathi uziva udiniwe kancinci.
I have known this for a long time.	Kudala ndikwazi oku.
He didn't think that would happen, though.	Wayengacingi ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
I will not do it.	Andiyi kwenza .
I want this to be my job.	Ndifuna oku kube ngumsebenzi wam.
There, behind him, not too far away.	Apho, emva kwakhe, hayi kude kakhulu.
I never spoke to him after that.	Andizange ndithethe naye emva koko.
It's, it's your thing.	Yinto, into yakho.
Thank you so much for being here.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba lapha.
I will come back and wait.	Ndiza kubuya ndilinde.
And maybe they didn't.	Kwaye mhlawumbi abazange.
I hope you find help here.	Ndiyathemba ukufumana uncedo apha.
The problem is which one.	Ingxaki kukuba yeyiphi.
It will be great !.	Kuya kuba kuhle!.
I think you do not know.	Ndicinga ukuba awuyazi.
He did not want to see it.	Wayengafuni ukubona.
Three hours, then.	Iiyure ezintathu, ngoko.
And then there was no reason.	Kwaye ke kwakungekho sizathu.
Obviously yes.	Ngokucacileyo ewe.
Everything is just right.	Yonke into ilungile kanye.
And no, by the way.	Kwaye hayi, ngendlela.
For a very long time.	Kuba ixesha elide kakhulu.
What and where do you live.	Yintoni kwaye uhlala phi.
Nobody wants to be here.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
I knew you would do nothing.	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
I thought this would be great.	Bendicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba kuhle.
Really, you are the reason.	Ngokwenene, nguwe isizathu.
Probably not now.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoku.
No they say, then yes.	Hayi bathi, emva koko ewe.
Only you did not.	Kuphela awuzange wenze.
But you have gone too far this time.	Kodwa uhambe kakhulu ngeli xesha.
I know that .	Ndiyayazi lo nto .
I'm scared.	Ndiyoyika ke.
Not a little, but a lot.	Hayi kancinci, kodwa kakhulu.
That means very little.	Oko kuthetha kancinci kakhulu.
He plays the piano very well.	Udlala ipiyano kakuhle kakhulu.
You look busy.	Ukhangeleka uxakekile.
I'm sorry for dinner.	Ndiyaxolisa ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
No not yet.	Hayi, okwangoku.
I have known my whole life.	Ndiyazi ubomi bam bonke.
She sits down again.	Aphinde ahlale phantsi.
And work.	Kwaye umsebenzi.
It's his thing.	Yinto yakhe.
He was scared then.	Wayesoyika ngoko.
It is not difficult at all.	Akukho nzima kwaphela.
Otherwise, you never know what will happen.	Ngaphandle koko, awukwazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
And if he died.	Kwaye ukuba wafa.
This seems to me.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kum.
You are better here with us.	Ungcono apha kunye nathi.
And some.	Kwaye abanye .
Really because of doing so.	Ngokwenene ngenxa yokwenza njalo.
I didn't want to see him.	Bendingafuni ndimbone.
But maybe he can't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akakwazi.
But he is your husband.	Kodwa yindoda yakho.
I'm glad you won a lot.	Ndiyavuya uphumelele kakhulu.
That means bedtime.	Oko kuthetha ixesha lokulala.
But there is one major problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enkulu enye.
He has to do that.	Ufanele ukuba enze njalo.
It is impossible to know for sure.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
I can sit next to him.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhlala ndim ecaleni kwakhe.
I thought about it almost every day.	Ndandicinga ngayo phantse yonke imihla.
He asked me why.	Uye wandibuza ukuba kutheni.
He's trying to think.	Uzama ukucinga.
But only if her mother was not there.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba umama wakhe wayengekho.
And it can be very difficult.	Kwaye inokuba nzima kakhulu.
But he didn't know what it was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
Ikati.	Ikati .
You know, just saying things really.	Uyazi, ukuthetha nje izinto ngenene.
Yes, this does happen.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka.
He did not really want to go.	Wayengafuni nyani ukuhamba.
He left after that.	Wemka emva koko.
So, you.	Ngoko ke, wena.
Maybe eating something.	Mhlawumbi ukutya into.
Why would anyone do that ?.	Kutheni umntu esenza lonto?.
And some people.	Kwaye abanye abantu.
Ready to work.	Ukulungele ukusebenza.
So, you are right to wait.	Ngoko ke, ulungile ukuba ulinde.
I don't even know if he will ever do that.	Andazi nokuba uya kuze enze njalo na.
There is no worse case.	Akukho meko embi kakhulu.
Not with my children.	Hayi nabantwana bam.
And, that's good.	Kwaye, oko kuhle.
So he stayed in the house.	Wahlala ke endlwini.
He has looked my way.	Uye wajonga indlela yam.
It seems that you do too.	Kubonakala ngathi nawe wenza njalo.
It wasn't too hard.	Akuzange kube nzima kakhulu.
All of this looks good.	Konke oku kubonakala kulungile.
His wife, too.	Umfazi wakhe, naye.
And maybe even better.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ngcono kakhulu.
I don’t want to say anything about it, though.	Andifuni kuthetha nto ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
Yes, if it is really good.	Ewe, ukuba ilungile ngokwenene.
Don't just take it.	Musa ukuthatha nje.
He did not know why he was here.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni elapha.
But this one.	Kodwa lo .
You can be really good.	Unokuba ulungile ngokwenene.
So, this should be a lot of fun.	Ngoko, oku kufuneka kube mnandi kakhulu.
But in your house.	Kodwa endlini yakho.
And yes, that's right.	Kwaye ewe, yinyani leyo.
I thought about it all night.	Bendicinga ngayo ubusuku bonke.
You can too.	Nawe unokuba kuyo.
But not much to see.	Kodwa akukho kakhulu ukubona.
Not food, though.	Hayi ukutya, nangona kunjalo.
This is not really about him.	Oku akukho malunga naye ngokwenene.
Tell me someone you love.	Ndixelele umntu uyamthanda.
Maybe we'll go there.	Mhlawumbi siya kuya apho.
Then help me.	Ndincede ke.
You will not get anything.	Awuyi kufumana nto.
I could not come.	Andikwazanga ukuza.
He wants to make you better.	Ufuna ukwenza ngcono wena.
You do that to me.	Uyenza lonto kum.
More on that later.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
Help the people here.	Nceda abantu apha.
I mean in a better way.	Ndithetha ukuba ngendlela engcono.
But more than that.	Kodwa ngaphezu koko .
I don't remember it.	Andikhumbuli ngayo.
Not really, of course.	Hayi ngokwenene, kunjalo.
Nothing in it! 	Akukho nto kuyo!
No one is talking about anything else.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngenye into.
Success means everything.	Ukuphumelela kuthetha yonke into.
You don't want to talk about money, okay.	Awufuni kuthetha ngemali, kulungile.
Unless something bad happens, it is.	Ngaphandle kokuba kwenzeke into embi, kunjalo.
I know.	Ndiyazi mna.
Someone came to my school.	Omnye weza esikolweni sam.
So many people.	Ngoko abantu abaninzi.
Not even far away.	Akukho nokuba kunokwenzeka kude.
I wanted him to have it.	Bendifuna abe nayo.
I would love your help, too.	Ndingathanda uncedo lwakho, nam.
It will start well enough.	Iza kuqala kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
He would love to meet you if you want.	Angathanda ukudibana nawe ukuba uyafuna.
Before dinner, really.	Ngaphambi kwesidlo sangokuhlwa, ngokwenene.
And some.	Kwaye ezinye.
This you hope for.	Oku unethemba.
This is all for us.	Le yinto yonke kuthi.
You will definitely have to leave one day.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kufuneka uhambe ngenye imini.
I wanted to see where you work.	Bendifuna ukubona apho usebenza khona.
Yes, we will see.	Ewe, siza kubona.
I think you brought it.	Ndicinga ukuba uze nayo.
But all this is hope.	Kodwa konke oku lithemba.
You must have learned this.	Umele ukuba wafunda ngale nto.
Well, a little more.	Kulungile, ngaphezu kancinci.
He wanted to succeed.	Wayefuna ukuphumelela.
While this is possible, it is not.	Nangona oku kunokwenzeka, akunjalo.
Meanwhile, he is asleep.	Okwangoku, ulele.
I wanted the police.	Bendifuna amapolisa.
He was not alone in that.	Wayengekho yedwa kuloo nto.
I know you're not going.	Ndiyazi ukuba awuyi.
I'm just tired of it.	Ndidiniwe nje yiyo.
Not there, then.	Hayi apho, ngoko.
And the sooner the better.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza kungcono.
Maybe not for you.	Mhlawumbi hayi kuwe.
I wanted to know, one way or another.	Bendifuna ukwazi, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
Because no one is you.	Ngokuba akukho mntu nguwe.
He became difficult.	Waba nzima.
Thank you so much for all your help.	Enkosi kakhulu ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
Where do you live.	Uhlala phi.
It takes many hours to read a book.	Kuthatha iiyure ezininzi ukufunda incwadi.
Later, much later, in the car.	Kamva, kakhulu kamva, emotweni.
I can't wait though.	Andikwazi kulinda kodwa.
It takes a lot for you.	Kuthatha okuninzi kuwe.
Or what are you really trying to do here.	Okanye ngenene uzama ukwenza ntoni apha.
I don't want you to talk to me.	Andifuni uthethe nam.
I've thought a lot about it.	Ndiye ndacinga kakhulu kuyo.
I can't see how I can do that.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
One has to try to stay up all night.	Umntu kufuneka azame ukuhlala ubusuku bonke.
Here, for you.	Apha, kuwe.
Everyone at work.	Wonke umntu emsebenzini.
How beautiful.	Kuhle kangakanani.
But he often did.	Kodwa wayedla ngokuba njalo.
It would take all night.	Bekuya kuthatha ubusuku bonke.
You know where this thing is.	Uyayazi ukuba iphi le nto.
About everything, it seems to us.	Malunga nayo yonke into, kubonakala ngathi.
He also did not think.	Naye akazange acinge.
Give me more time.	Ndinike ixesha elingakumbi.
And then you wait.	Kwaye ke ulinde.
It should be fun to read.	Kumele kube mnandi ukufunda.
He's not going, of course.	Akayi, kunjalo.
You really can't.	Ngokwenene awukwazi.
The woman is hard pressed to speak.	Umfazi kunzima ukuba athethe.
I did not speak well to him.	Khange ndithethe kakuhle naye.
But he lived alone.	Kodwa wayehlala yedwa.
And again, no.	Kwaye kwakhona, hayi.
But I really know that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
They will be leaving soon.	Baza kuhamba kungekudala.
But we will see what happens.	Kodwa siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
I wonder who he is, though.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani, nangona kunjalo.
Thank you for making it as fun and easy as possible.	Enkosi ngokwenza kube mnandi kwaye kube lula kangangoko.
A very long story.	Ibali elide kakhulu.
I'd better talk to her myself.	Ngcono ndithethe naye ngokwam.
Then you will see what it is.	Emva koko uya kubona ukuba yintoni na.
You made my night.	Wenze ubusuku bam.
His voice.	Ilizwi lakhe .
No need here.	Akukho mfuneko apha.
I need your car.	Ndifuna imoto yakho.
I live in a beautiful place.	Ndihlala kwindawo entle.
His arrival.	Ukufika kwakhe.
It just happened there.	Kwenzeka nje apho.
Or sit down.	Okanye uhlale phantsi.
He can be her friend to anyone.	Unokuba ngumhlobo wakhe nabani na.
That task will not be easy though.	Loo msebenzi awuyi kuba lula nangona kunjalo.
He was afraid he would do it.	Wayesoyika ukuba uza kwenza njalo.
However, this is not entirely the case.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
Well, three down, two to go.	Kulungile, ezintathu phantsi, ezimbini ukuya.
Well, maybe another word for it.	Ewe, mhlawumbi elinye igama elingakumbi.
I'm going up.	Ndiya phezulu.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into ngathi.
He acknowledged that he was intelligent.	Wavuma ukuba ukrelekrele.
His gun is coming fast.	Umpu wakhe uza ngokukhawuleza.
He didn't really want to have it.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene ukuba nayo.
Tell me all about it.	Ndixelele konke ngayo.
I will not speak again here.	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe apha.
Old thing, nowhere.	Into endala, akukho ndawo.
He would see through her.	Wayeza kubona ngaye.
You probably already know this.	Mhlawumbi sele uyazi le nto.
My wife left.	Wemka umfazi wam.
He can have all the money he wants.	Unokuba nayo yonke imali ayifunayo.
Trying to do more.	Ukuzama ukwenza ngakumbi.
Thank you for all your help.	Enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
She ran back to her house.	Wabaleka wabuyela endlwini yakhe.
Maybe not now, maybe you didn't.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoku, mhlawumbi awuzange uyenze.
Clearly, he meant the problem.	Ngokucacileyo, wayethetha ingxaki.
And, of course, it will be.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba njalo.
At home all day.	Ekhaya imini yonke.
You have to take it with you when you go.	Kufuneka uhambe nayo xa uhamba.
And then he died, for her, too.	Kwaye ke wafa, ngenxa yakhe, kwakhona.
She is not beautiful.	Akakho mhle.
I'll get one later today.	Ndiza kufumana enye kamva namhlanje.
She was able to help my children.	Wakwazi ukunceda abantwana bam.
It's a big deal if that's the case.	Yinto enkulu ukuba kunjalo.
I think you bought one too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe uthenge enye.
I've done enough then to stay lifelong.	Ndenze ngokwaneleyo ngoko ukuba ndihlale ubomi bonke.
As you like, you know, what his name is.	Njengoko uthanda, uyazi, ngubani igama lakhe.
I don't want to eat anything.	Andifuni kutya nantoni na.
He can't, he can never do that.	Akakwazi, akanakuze enze njalo.
That's what he had to do.	Nto leyo kwafuneka ayenze.
You may have told him the place and the time.	Usenokuba umxelele indawo kunye nexesha.
I'm going there.	Ndiya khona mna.
She doesn't think she's pretty, though.	Akacingi ukuba mhle, nangona kunjalo.
He didn't need to know yet.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba azi okwangoku.
And that means everyone.	Kwaye oko kuthetha wonke umntu.
He continued, but spoke alone over himself.	Waqhubeka, kodwa wathetha yedwa ngaphezu kwakhe.
Strangely enough, of course.	Ngendlela engaqhelekanga, kunjalo.
No, he did not say anything about it.	Hayi, akazange athethe nantoni na kuloo nto.
I just want to know if it is possible.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
But yes, you will try.	Kodwa ewe, uya kuzama.
So it will take time.	Ngoko kuya kuthatha ixesha.
Will you do it again.	Ngaba uya kuphinda.
And then you will go to him.	Kwaye ke uya kuya kuye.
This, it seems, is hard to do.	Oku, kubonakala, kunzima ukwenza.
Do not do such a thing.	Musa ukwenza into enjalo.
But, you are also human.	Kodwa, nawe ungumntu.
And he learned.	Kwaye wafunda.
You think you have it.	Ucinga ukuba unayo.
Another few weeks.	Enye iiveki ezimbalwa.
He wanted me to be able to quit.	Wayefuna ukuba ndikwazi ukuyeka.
Then he came to my house.	Emva koko uze endlini yam.
And maybe you should in this case.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kufuneka kule meko.
He did not want to go further.	Wayengafuni ukuya phambili.
The gun lay on the ground.	Umpu walala phantsi.
They will find another way.	Baza kufumana enye indlela.
I'm sorry to have you here.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba nawe apha.
It's hard and you know it.	Kunzima kwaye uyayazi.
He could not decide for himself what to do.	Akazange akwazi ukwenza isigqibo ngaloo nto.
It has to happen now.	Kufuneka yenzeke ngoku.
And this is very difficult to work on.	Kwaye oku kunzima kakhulu ukusebenza kuyo.
That wasn't much.	Oko kwakungekho kakhulu.
But he ate nothing.	Kodwa akazange atye nto.
But she is very beautiful.	Kodwa mhle kakhulu.
But, that's it.	Kodwa, yiloo nto.
That's done.	Yenziwe loo nto.
He did everything else.	Uyenzile yonke enye into.
This can be very far.	Oku kunokuba kude kakhulu.
Then go to the house.	Emva koko ukuya endlini.
Everyone wanted money.	Wonke umntu wayefuna imali.
Probably in it.	Mhlawumbi kuyo.
It's that hard.	Kunzima ngolo hlobo.
And not before.	Kwaye hayi ngaphambili.
I wanted to be up there.	Bendifuna ukuba phaya phezulu.
To keep you interested.	Ukuze uhlale unomdla.
But not all night.	Kodwa hayi ubusuku bonke.
I do the work once.	Ndenza umsebenzi kanye.
But aside a little at a time.	Kodwa ecaleni kancinci ngexesha.
He loves his little girl.	Uyayithanda intombi yakhe encinci.
This is unlikely to happen.	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
Stop doing it all.	Yeka ukwenza konke.
Soon you will be with him, one way or another.	Kungekudala uza kuba naye, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
He walked a little.	Uhambe kancinci.
He will have to think more.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngakumbi.
Such a beautiful room.	Igumbi elihle kangaka.
Down, down, go.	Phantsi, phantsi, uhambe.
Probably at that time.	Mhlawumbi ngelo xesha.
Also, a lot of money.	Kwakhona, imali eninzi.
But again a little bit.	Kodwa kwakhona kancinci.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akazi ukuba yintoni na.
So maybe he would be there again.	Ngoko mhlawumbi wayeza kuba lapho kwakhona.
Moreover, he is.	Ngaphezu koko, nguye.
Not the first, though.	Hayi kuqala, nangona kunjalo.
Everyone else.	Wonke omnye umntu.
It comes to you instantly.	Iza kuwe ngokukhawuleza.
He gave me my place.	Wandinika indawo yam.
His name alone.	Igama lakhe kuphela.
I don't know how anyone can do that.	Andiqondi ukuba umntu angayenza njani loo nto.
That's a lot of living.	Yinto eninzi yokuhlala leyo.
All my doing.	Konke ukwenza kwam.
Well, everyone knows that.	Ewe, wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
That is my hope.	Lithemba lam elo.
Because he is intelligent.	Kuba ukrelekrele.
Of course not!	Ewe akunjalo kwaphela.
All right, we'll be back tomorrow.	Kulungile, siza kubuya ngomso.
He said he really wanted to talk to me.	Wathi nyani ufuna ukuthetha nam.
He would like to be the only dog.	Angathanda ukuba yedwa inja.
Since he did not say anything, he did.	Ekubeni akazange athethe nto, wathetha.
Because you did the right thing.	Kuba kanye wenze into elungileyo.
He finally found a place and went inside.	Ekugqibeleni wafumana indawo waza wangena.
No, really.	Hayi, ngokwenene.
Yes, she enjoys reading books.	Ewe, uyathanda ukufunda iincwadi.
Since the answer is yes with you.	Ukusukela impendulo ewe nawe.
His wife left him alone.	Umfazi wakhe wahamba yedwa.
Something has to be done, of course.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe, kunjalo.
No one ever talked about him.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngaye.
I will try to do that.	Ndiya kuzama ukwenjenjalo.
No one has to tell me.	Akukho mntu kufuneka andixelele.
You have to get home.	Kufuneka ufike ekhaya.
Or okay, really.	Okanye kulungile, ngokwenene.
So he sat down to think.	Ngoko wahlala phantsi ukuze acinge.
That's why you've agreed.	Yiyo loo nto uye wavuma.
That could be a worse thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto engalunganga ngakumbi.
What a bad !.	Yintoni embi!.
But you will find much more.	Kodwa uya kufumana okuninzi ngakumbi.
Dad never did that.	UTata akazange ayenze loo nto.
Not just any dog.	Hayi nje nayiphi na inja.
Many say.	Abaninzi bathi.
Slowly, of course.	Kancinci, kunjalo.
This goes on for a very long time.	Oku kuqhubeka ixesha elide kakhulu.
Everyone looked at him.	Wonke umntu wajonga kuye.
He tried to do things himself.	Wazama ukwenza izinto ngokwakhe.
And all of this is really happening.	Kwaye konke oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
They will both want to get out.	Bobabini baya kufuna ukuphuma.
He knows what he wants.	Uyayazi into ayifunayo.
Not exactly.	Hayi kanye.
However it is not required.	Nangona kunjalo akufuneki.
I did not know how.	Bendingazi ukuba njani.
He talked about something else.	Wathetha ngenye into.
All of this happened very quickly.	Yonke le nto yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
The problem is, the picture looks bad.	Ingxaki kukuba, umfanekiso ukhangeleka kakubi.
This is a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu le.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Akukho nto inokuba nzima ngakumbi.
Yes, today it is.	Ewe, namhlanje kunjalo.
One never happened.	Enye ayizange yenzeke.
I thought we should.	Ndandicinga ukuba sifanele.
That's one very thing.	Yinto enye kakhulu leyo.
It doesn't have to be that hard.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube nzima ngolo hlobo.
I can't think of that now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngaloo nto ngoku.
But he came with me.	Kodwa weza nam.
Thank you !!!.	Enkosi enkosi!!!.
We need to do that again.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto kwakhona.
Don't play house if you don't want to play house.	Musa ukudlala indlu ukuba awufuni ukudlala indlu.
But tonight, nobody.	Kodwa ngokuhlwanje, akukho mntu.
And that happened in his career.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka emsebenzini wakhe.
I couldn’t get here fast enough.	Andikwazanga kufika apha ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
He looks great.	Ubonakala kakhulu .
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nantoni na.
I will definitely buy one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiza kuthenga enye.
I thought about it a lot.	Ndacinga ngayo kakhulu.
Soon he found something.	Kungekudala wafumana into.
I just can't sit still.	Andikwazi ukuhlala nje.
It's always hard.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kunzima.
He will certainly come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuza.
Although no one wanted the book.	Nangona kwakungekho mntu wayefuna le ncwadi.
He just loves her.	Uyamthanda nje.
You go to dinner without me.	Uya kwisidlo ngaphandle kwam.
Is it time now.	Ngaba lixesha ngoku.
There's just no way about it.	Akukho ndlela nje malunga nayo.
One has to think about that.	Umntu kufuneka acinge ngaloo nto.
He admitted that.	Wavuma ukuba.
At the moment it is fine and fast.	Okwangoku kulungile kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
But that was not necessary.	Kodwa oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
Maybe this time they will.	Mhlawumbi ngeli xesha baya kwenza njalo.
I want to be a friend.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumhlobo.
Everyone did.	Wonke umntu wayenza.
I don't care how much you look like him.	Andikhathali nokuba ufana naye kangakanani na.
He agreed to meet.	Wavuma ukudibana.
Not just us.	Hayi nje kuthi.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki konke konke.
He will always return.	Uya kubuya rhoqo.
I hope they succeed next week.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuphumelela kwiveki ezayo.
If something is wrong.	Ukuba kukho into embi.
You don't even have to think about me.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba ucinge ngam.
They say you have to buy one.	Bathi kufuneka uthenge enye.
He will be back soon.	Uza kuza kwakhona kungekudala.
Almost in the afternoon.	Phantse emva kwemini.
But there was really no one there.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu ngokwenene.
I'm always trying to find a new place.	Ndihlala ndizama indawo entsha.
I just can't do that.	Andikwazi nje ukuyenza loo nto.
I'm not sure how that happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yenzeke njani loo nto.
Then he came our way.	Emva koko weza ngendlela yethu.
But you will need a name.	Kodwa uya kufuna igama.
Everyone thinks he's good.	Wonke umntu ucinga ukuba ulungile.
All the time, nothing.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, akukho nto.
Wherever you go, you go.	Apho uya khona, uya.
This happened afterwards.	Oku kwenzeka emva koko.
He doesn't know where he is now.	Akayazi ukuba uphi ngoku.
I wish we were like that.	Ndinqwenela ukuba sibe njalo.
I'm sorry about that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngalonto.
I hope you know how to do that by now.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi indlela yokwenza oko ngoku.
He was not tall enough.	Wayengekho mde ngokwaneleyo.
He will be the one.	Uya kuba nguye.
He fell asleep in prison.	Walala entolongweni.
He is like us, really.	Ufana nathi, ngokwenene.
I don't remember how you got here.	Andikhumbuli ukuba ufike njani apha.
He started talking to her.	Waqalisa ukuthetha nayo.
Then we will see what happens.	Emva koko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni .
He tried some.	Wazama ezinye.
But there is something else there, too.	Kodwa kukho enye into apho, nayo.
That party.	Ukuba itheko .
This seems like a big deal.	Oku kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
I would definitely like to stay there.	Ndingathanda ngokuqinisekileyo ukuhlala apho.
I have to look away.	Kufuneka ndijonge kude.
And it is very true.	Kwaye yinyani kakhulu.
Slowly, he opened his eyes.	Kancinci, wavula amehlo akhe.
Now we both know why.	Ngoku sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni.
But now that's it.	Kodwa ngoku yiloo nto.
It could be everything or nothing to me.	Inokuba yinto yonke okanye akukho nto kum.
But not only that.	Kodwa hayi nje.
Definitely a lot of coffee.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ikofu eninzi.
Impossible though.	Akunakwenzeka nokuba kunjalo.
At home at this time.	Ekhaya ngeli xesha.
We have to be much better.	Kufuneka sibe ngcono kakhulu.
I heard about him just once.	Ndeva ngaye kanye nje.
How do you think it happened?	Ucinga ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Tomorrow, perhaps, a little walk outside.	Ngomso, mhlawumbi, ukuhamba kancinci ngaphandle.
Give me a name.	Ndinike igama.
This is clearly no question.	Oku ngokucacileyo akukho mbuzo.
Now it would take years.	Ngoku bekuya kuthatha iminyaka.
Look, you don't have to stay with us.	Jonga, akukho mfuneko yokuba uhlale nathi.
There is a way to do that.	Kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
All but you, of course.	Konke ngaphandle kwakho, kunjalo.
He saw everything.	Wabona yonke into.
I would like to be a teacher in your class.	Ndingathanda ukuba ngutitshala eklasini yakho.
If you have decided, then so do you.	Ukuba uye wagqiba, ngoko ke naye.
Please let me know if something goes wrong.	Nceda undixelele ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
He is now retired.	Ngoku udla umhlala-phantsi.
But one did.	Kodwa omnye uyenzile.
Not that way.	Hayi ngaloo ndlela.
But he is very smart.	Kodwa ukrelekrele kakhulu.
It seemed like a job, now.	Kwakubonakala ngathi ngumsebenzi, ngoku.
This person was talking to him.	Lo mntu wayethetha naye.
I know it inside.	Ndiyayazi ngaphakathi.
He just loves to find his way.	Uthanda nje ukufumana indlela yakhe.
But he fell asleep.	Kodwa walala.
He got into bed with her.	Wangena ebhedini naye.
You should have done it.	Bekufanele uyenzile.
This is a new person.	Lo ngumntu omtsha.
Staying alone at home all day.	Ukuhlala wedwa ekhaya imini yonke.
You probably already know that.	Mhlawumbi sele uyayazi loo nto.
My mother doesn't know anything about it.	Umama akazi kwanto ngalonto.
He came to her side.	Weza ecaleni kwakhe.
Then he asked to leave.	Emva koko wacela ukuhamba.
Don't come to town.	Musa ukuza edolophini.
He would like to.	Angathanda.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
You talk about it.	Uthetha ngayo.
I do it alone.	Ndenza ndedwa.
That's a long time for me.	Lixesha elide elo kum.
He didn't know what it was, and he didn't even know why.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni, kwaye wayengazi nokuba kutheni.
You have to be on top.	Kufuneka ube phezulu.
True, very true.	Yinyani, inyani kakhulu.
Just here for convenience.	Apha nje ukuze kube lula.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu wenza kakuhle.
That will take some work, though.	Oko kuya kuthatha omnye umsebenzi, nangona kunjalo.
You want it easy.	Ufuna lula.
But about him.	Kodwa ngaye.
This he probably did.	Oku kusenokwenzeka ukuba wakwenza.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze njalo.
I don't know why.	Andikwazi isizathu sokuba.
They will wait for the time for everything.	Baza kulinda ixesha kuyo yonke into.
Well, that's exactly it.	Ewe, yiloo nto kanye.
All is well there.	Konke kulungile apho.
And so it is here.	Kwaye kunjalo apha.
Everything will be much easier.	Konke kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
He agreed to go with me.	Wavuma ukuhamba nam.
Old problem.	Ingxaki endala.
Her mother went to see what was happening.	Umama wakhe waya kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He also knew he knew.	Naye wayesazi ukuba uyayazi.
Another bus that needs help.	Enye ibhasi efuna uncedo.
I could not wait to leave.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukuhamba.
What, then, should a person do? 	Kufuneka enze ntoni ke umntu?
I want to be with her.	Ndifuna ukuba naye.
Now, tell me this.	Ngoku, ndixelele oku.
And death.	Kwaye ukufa.
But not me, thank you.	Kodwa hayi mna, enkosi.
I don't believe in that at all.	Andikholelwa kuloo nto kwaphela.
He never did such a thing.	Akazange enze into enje.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Uthetha ukuba ucinga .
So we have to go fast.	Ngoko kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
It will be very difficult.	Kuza kuba nzima kakhulu.
But we know that he is not.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba akanjalo.
Nobody told me anything.	Akukho mntu undixelele nto.
For he said.	Kuba wathi .
My mother knew, too.	Umama wayesazi, naye.
And you are ready to do it again.	Kwaye ukulungele ukuyenza kwakhona.
One is here.	Omnye ulapha.
And he never did that.	Kwaye akazange akwenze oko.
I'm afraid it's him, though.	Ndiyoyika ukuba nguye, nangona kunjalo.
But then something.	Kodwa ke into .
A similar problem arises.	Kwenzeka ingxaki efanayo.
No, time.	Akunjalo, ixesha.
That way there is no problem.	Ngaloo ndlela akukho ngxaki.
He said he would be there.	Wathi uzakuba khona.
I can't wait for him to read.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuba afunde.
There is definitely something wrong.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho into engalunganga.
It will be difficult and it will take time.	Kuya kuba nzima kwaye kuya kuthatha ixesha.
I know you will do a good job with it.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kwenza umsebenzi omhle ngayo.
Well, this is a very strange thing that is happening with it.	Ewe, le yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu eyenzekayo nayo.
And he doesn't know why.	Kwaye akasazi isizathu.
So, it will be difficult.	Ngoko, kuya kuba nzima.
I suspect it is not.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba akunjalo.
He is the driver.	Nguye lo uqhuba imoto.
This is happening everywhere.	Oku kuqhubeka kuyo yonke indawo.
He looked so bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi ngolo hlobo.
For us, one.	Kuthi, enye.
And soon after that, he went to work.	Kwaye kungekudala emva koko, waya emsebenzini.
Then he saw my book.	Emva koko wabona incwadi yam.
Well, this will get your attention.	Kulungile, oku kuya kufumana ingqalelo yakho.
And anytime.	Kwaye nanini na.
So all is well and it will be fine in the end.	Ngoko konke kulungile kwaye kuya kuba kuhle ekugqibeleni.
Now you can do many things.	Ngoku uyakwazi ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
Everyone who wants one has it.	Wonke umntu ofuna enye unayo.
You will not have to.	Akuyi kufuneka.
We haven't done that in a long time.	Asizange siyenze loo nto ixesha elide.
To one of us.	Komnye wethu.
I never told anyone or talked about it.	Andizange ndixelele mntu okanye ndithethe ngayo.
But it always is.	Kodwa kuhlala kunjalo.
Then we will be able to help.	Ngelo xesha siya kukwazi ukunceda.
There seemed to be only one room, a bedroom.	Kwakubonakala kukho igumbi elinye kuphela, igumbi lokulala.
I don't know what happened next.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
It had to be hard.	Kwafuneka kube nzima.
Made very easy.	Yenziwe lula kakhulu.
Are you ?.	Ngaba nawe?.
And thank you '.	Kwaye enkosi'.
But I was not alone.	Kodwa andizange ndedwa.
Not at all, of course.	Akunjalo konke, kunjalo.
He wanted two more things.	Wayefuna ezinye izinto ezimbini.
One is simplicity.	Enye kukuba lula.
About what happened to him.	Ngento eyenzekayo kuye.
He acted quickly.	Wenza ngokukhawuleza.
About anything really.	Malunga nantoni ngokwenene.
And very much so.	Kwaye kakhulu.
There was no one.	Kwakungekho bani.
Many people go.	Abantu abaninzi baya.
It seemed difficult.	Kwakubonakala kunzima.
No one and everyone.	Akukho mntu kwaye bonke.
And that would not be right.	Kwaye oko akuyi kulungile.
He sat in his car.	Wahlala emotweni yakhe.
Far farther than you think.	Kude kakhulu kunokuba ucinga.
Or his attention.	Okanye ingqalelo yakhe.
But that is no question.	Kodwa oko akukho mbuzo.
I read this early.	Ndifunde kwangethuba oku.
This should not be far off.	Oku akufuneki kube kude.
It’s hard to find fault with it, really.	Kunzima ukufumana impazamo kuyo, ngenene.
I think this is all.	Ndicinga ukuba oku konke.
I couldn't, not for long.	Andikwazanga, hayi ixesha elide.
You probably know what you want to say.	Usenokuba uyayazi into ofuna ukuyithetha.
But, you know, you think after a while.	Kodwa, uyazi, ucinga emva kwexesha.
Thus, making it difficult to see.	Ngaloo ndlela, ukwenza kube nzima ukubona.
Waiting for that.	Ukulinda kuloo nto.
Of course, no one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akukho mntu.
We have done too much or too little.	Senze kakhulu okanye kancinci kakhulu.
He will have to know in the end.	Kuya kufuneka azi ekugqibeleni.
Me with all this money.	Nam ngayo yonke le mali.
And it should be painful.	Kwaye kufuneka kube buhlungu.
He did not stay that long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide kangaka nyani.
My father did not do that.	Utata akazange enjenjalo.
He knows the whole thing.	Uyayazi yonke loo nto.
You will start again.	Uza kuqala kwakhona.
If it will end.	Ukuba kuya kuphela.
Just like it is today.	Kanye njengokuba kunjalo namhlanje.
We will definitely do another soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kwenza enye kungekudala.
Not really at home.	Hayi ngokwenene ekhaya.
I told her never to come here again.	Ndamxelela ukuba angaphindi eze apha.
You really have to be in bed.	Ngenene kufuneka ube ebhedini.
We never got too high, we never got too low.	Asizange sibe phezulu kakhulu, asizange sibe phantsi kakhulu.
That is our job here.	Ngumsebenzi wethu lowo apha.
I forgot to eat.	Ndilibele ukutya.
You told me yes.	Undixelele ewe.
Then something very happened very soon afterward.	Emva koko kwenzeka enye into kungekudala emva koko.
You have to tell.	Kufuneka uxelele.
But you need to know what's going on there.	Kodwa kufuneka wazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni phaya.
Good job, everyone !.	Umsebenzi omhle, wonke umntu !.
Me, his mother.	Mna, umama wakhe.
I would love to work with you.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza nawe.
I know it can be so.	Ndiyazi ukuba inokuba njalo.
He will do it my way.	Uza kuyenza ngendlela yam.
We will go hard.	Siza kuhamba nzima.
This once, please.	Oku kube kanye, nceda.
You never came and you never left.	Awuzange uze kwaye awuzange uhambe.
It is good to be sad.	Kulungile ukuba buhlungu.
Someone came to me.	Omnye weza kum.
And it's very hard to get out of here.	Kwaye kunzima kakhulu ukuphuma apha.
Now you are ready to go now.	Ngoku ukulungele ukuhamba ngoku.
That never happened, though.	Oko akuzange kwenzeke, nangona kunjalo.
He made it hard for me to do better.	Wenze ukuba kube nzima ukwenza ngcono mna.
He really did.	Ngokwenene wenza njalo.
It's very good today.	Ilungile kakhulu namhlanje.
Or at this time.	Okanye ngeli xesha.
Everything is very unusual.	Yonke into engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
We'll talk about that soon.	Siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kungekudala.
He says he doesn't know, so he doesn't know.	Uthi akazi, ngoko akazi.
I was thinking of something else.	Bendicinga ngenye into.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nceda undixelele ukuba ndenze njani.
You've been here a long time.	Unexesha elide ulapha.
Give me three days.	Ndinike iintsuku ezintathu.
A book? 	Incwadi?
Then you have made a decision.	Emva koko wenze isigqibo.
He slept a little, but a little.	Walala kancinci, kodwa kancinci.
However, there is a problem.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki.
But one day you know.	Kodwa ngenye imini uyazi.
I love the fact that you stay with us.	Ndiyayithanda into yokuba uhlale kunye nathi.
And another time.	Kwaye elinye ixesha.
He knows everything.	Kukwazi konke.
He should have spoken earlier now.	Bekufanele athethe ngaphambili ngoku.
Maybe you should do the same.	Mhlawumbi nawe ufanele wenze into efanayo.
It seemed, it was very difficult to walk.	Kwakubonakala, kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba.
Sorry more.	Uxolo ngakumbi.
Something to look forward to.	Into ekufuneka ujonge phambili kuyo.
Not exactly a question.	Hayi ncam umbuzo.
He decided to go with her.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ahambe naye.
Thank you for such a wonderful job.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi omhle kangaka.
Give me two weeks.	Ndinike iiveki ezimbini.
She is sitting on the bed.	Uhlala ebhedini.
This is just inside.	Oku nje ngaphakathi.
I should not have come here.	Bekungafanelanga ndize apha.
We also need it otherwise.	Nathi ngaphandle koko kufuneka.
And you are even more successful.	Kwaye uphumelele ngakumbi.
We'll start at the bottom.	Siza kuqala phantsi.
I can't buy that at all.	Andikwazi ukuthenga oko kwaphela.
Maybe he knew before we did.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ngaphambi kokuba senze.
But that can be difficult.	Kodwa oko kunokuba nzima.
For a very long time, as it seems now.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, njengoko kubonakala ngoku.
No one really knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ncam.
I'm sure that will go well.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba oko kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
He knew something was wrong, very wrong.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga, engalunganga kakhulu.
I thought it was time.	Ndandicinga ukuba lixesha.
But why? 	Kodwa kutheni?
He just wants you.	Ufuna nje wena.
But not the next.	Kodwa hayi ezayo.
He cannot succeed and he does not know.	Akakwazi ukuphumelela kwaye akayazi.
And there is music.	Kwaye kukho umculo.
He started coming to me.	Waqalisa ukuza kum.
I know it isn't.	Ndiyazi ukuba ayinguye.
He took it and took it.	Wathatha wathatha wathatha.
He felt some things, too.	Waziva ezinye izinto, naye.
But you have to do other things.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze ezinye izinto.
So it would be better to stay this one out.	Ngoko kuya kuba ngcono ukuhlala lo ngaphandle.
But that is not me.	Kodwa ayindim lowo.
I'm scared of my little girl.	Ndiyoyika intombi yam encinci.
However, this did not happen.	Kodwa ke, akuzange kube njalo.
It doesn't have to be, but it is.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo, kodwa kunjalo.
It's okay to talk like that.	Kulungile ukuba uthethe ngolo hlobo.
I can't go to work.	Andikwazi ukuya emsebenzini.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi .
There is just something wrong with her.	Kukho nje into engalunganga ngaye.
He later returned to work.	Kamva wabuyela emsebenzini.
John did.	UYohane wayenza.
I don't remember anything like that.	Andikhumbuli nantoni na enje.
Yes, not all the time.	Ewe, hayi lonke ixesha.
That's just the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela nje.
Really, this is going to be very real.	Ngokwenene, oku kuya kuba yinyani kakhulu.
One day he says he didn't.	Ngenye imini uthi akazange.
Your mother always thought.	Wacinga njalo umama wakho.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, iya kwenza.
I am the only one.	Ndim kuphela, ndedwa.
It's a long time ago.	Kudala kudala.
In the classroom now.	Eklasini ngoku.
There is, something.	Kukho, into ethile.
You have to talk and tell people.	Kufuneka uthethe kwaye uxelele abantu.
And he has gotten so much better.	Kwaye uye waba ngcono kakhulu.
And he went down and departed.	Wehla ke wemka.
You need to know about that.	Kufuneka uyazi ngaloo nto.
But now it is very good.	Kodwa ngoku kuhle kakhulu.
Everything will be better than you expected.	Yonke into iya kuhamba ngcono kunokuba ulindele.
It ended the same way.	Kwaphela ngendlela efanayo.
That, and a few.	Oko, kwaye ezimbalwa.
Surely, it is clear why.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kucacile ukuba kutheni.
I live alone.	Ndihlala ndedwa.
I did it fast.	Ndenza ngokukhawuleza.
However, there is no one at home.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho mntu ekhaya.
But at night he lay down.	Kodwa ebusuku walala phantsi.
I love everything he did.	Ndiyayithanda yonke into ayenzileyo.
I would like to do it again.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza kwakhona.
You can be.	Unokuba .
I can see that something is wrong.	Ndiyakwazi ukubona ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
Music is available.	Umculo ukhona.
All there, he saw.	Bonke apho, wabona.
He said he thought it would be good for me.	Wathi ucinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kum.
Or it could be.	Okanye inokuba .
But you already have it.	Kodwa sele unayo.
I only did my job.	Ndenze umsebenzi wam kuphela.
Something is happening up there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo phaya phezulu.
But here's what you need to know.	Kodwa yinto ekufuneka uyazi.
He looked at the number.	Wajonga inombolo.
Not that is your job.	Akunjalo ukuba ngumsebenzi wakho.
I'm not even sure what is going on.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba kuqhubeka ntoni na.
It all happened.	Konke kwenzeka.
Then he told me everything.	Emva koko wandixelela konke.
One letter here, one there.	Enye ileta apha, enye phaya.
Or you know someone.	Okanye wazi umntu.
She was afraid to say anything.	Wayesoyika ukuthetha nantoni na.
Although fully clothed.	Nangona unxibe ngokupheleleyo.
He has been up all night.	Ukhe walala ubusuku bonke.
Or almost.	Okanye phantse.
I can control myself.	Ndiyakwazi ukuzibamba.
We both know that this is not the case.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I will finally get another one.	Ekugqibeleni ndiza kufumana enye.
I can't say for how long exactly.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba ixesha elingakanani kanye kanye.
Meeting friends.	Ukudibana nabahlobo.
The mother does not know.	Umama akazi.
But this was not fun.	Kodwa oku akuzange kube mnandi.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi ukuthetha naye.
He would like to talk.	Angathanda ukuthetha.
But what .	Kodwa ntoni .
I think everything is fine in the end.	Ndicinga ukuba yonke into ilungile ekugqibeleni.
And no one is talking about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu uthetha ngayo.
If not, I don't know what to do.	Ukuba akunjalo, andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni.
I won't have that.	Andiyi kuba nayo loo nto.
And money, of course.	Kwaye imali, kunjalo.
I hope we do.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kuyenza.
He knew he had to say something.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka athethe into.
But he came here looking for you.	Kodwa uze apha efuna wena.
It had to.	Kwafuneka .
And you told me what you think.	Kwaye undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
But it wasn't so fun.	Kodwa kwakungekho mnandi kangako.
I said nothing about him.	Khange ndithethe nto ngaye.
He never came here.	Zange eze apha.
He says he loves it.	Uthi uyayithanda.
I have to be honest.	Kufuneka ndithethe inyani.
Now is the time !.	Ngoku lixesha!.
If you will be there.	Ukuba uya kuba khona.
He had to try harder.	Kwafuneka azame ngakumbi.
All of us here.	Nathi sonke apha.
I will go with you.	Ndiya kuhamba nawe.
But, he did not do this.	Kodwa, akazange akwenze oku.
Very nice, really.	Mhle kakhulu, ngenene.
You have your thing.	Unayo into yakho.
But nothing after that.	Kodwa akukho nto emva koko.
He says he would like to go.	Uthi angathanda ukuhamba.
Whatever happens will happen.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo iya kwenzeka.
I can't say what will happen.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
He died one day.	Wafa ngenye imini.
It seemed like one thing and we were going to do it.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto enye kwaye siza kuyenza.
Also very fast.	Kwakhona ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Not without you.	Akunjalo ngaphandle kwakho.
So, we have to do it.	Ngoko ke, kufuneka senze.
That one, right there.	Lowo, kanye apho.
He found her to be his friend.	Wafumana ukuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
It is, and that is all.	Yiyo, kwaye yiyo yonke loo nto.
It will always be that way, he realized.	Kuya kuhlala kunjalo, waqonda.
This is good for us.	Oku kuhle kuthi.
But this is not here yet.	Kodwa oku akukho apha okwangoku.
The house you want to look at, you think.	Indlu efuna ujonge, ucinga.
That's what he did.	Yiloo nto ayenzileyo.
Last night .	Izolo ebusuku .
Three questions, please.	Imibuzo emithathu, nceda.
We know you're busy.	Siyazi ukuba uxakekile.
Not for me, of course.	Hayi kum, kunjalo.
But in this case, there is no need for that.	Kodwa kule meko, akukho mfuneko yokuba.
I want to be.	Ndifuna ukuba.
But for me, there is no question.	Kodwa kum, akukho mbuzo.
He has been there a long time.	Ukhona ixesha elide.
This will be very necessary.	Oku kuya kufuneka kakhulu.
My question is how hard it is to find one.	Umbuzo wam kukuba kunzima kangakanani ukufumana enye.
That for now.	Oko okwangoku.
You said the same thing to yourself.	Uthethe into efanayo nawe.
I'm not entirely sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba ndenze njani oku.
I love my little girl.	Ndiyayithanda intombi yam encinci.
Sure, you know that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
How far away from home.	Kude kangakanani ekhaya .
However, this may not be the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kunokwenzeka ukuba akukho.
He took a lamp.	Wathatha isibane.
I need to know what you told him yesterday.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba umxelele ntoni izolo.
Yes, it should.	Ewe kufuneka kube njalo.
But that's perfectly fine.	Kodwa oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
I have to look good.	Kufuneka ndijonge kakuhle.
Everyone stayed together.	Wonke umntu wahlala kunye.
Swimming before dinner.	Ukuqubha phambi kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
He just said he can't do that.	Uthe nje akanakuyenza loo nto.
He looked at the money and then left.	Wajonga imali emva koko wahamba.
He wants to know everything that happens.	Ufuna ukwazi yonke into eyenzekayo.
But he didn't want to do it with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto naye.
Yeah, yeah, it seems.	Ewe, ewe, kubonakala ngathi.
It's just one thing.	Yinto nje enye.
I did not want to come too soon.	Ndandingafuni ukuza ngokukhawuleza.
And you can do it.	Kwaye ungayenza.
He thought he wanted a life with her.	Wayecinga ukuba ufuna ubomi kunye naye.
He must be able to read.	Ufanele akwazi ukufunda.
But it is hard to tell.	Kodwa kunzima ukuxelela.
And he did this very well.	Kwaye oku wakwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Otherwise it looks good.	Ngaphandle koko kubonakala kulungile.
Again, that was not necessary.	Kwakhona, oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
He looked around the room.	Wajonga igumbi.
It's just better for me.	Kungcono nje kum.
I'm sure you feel the same way.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba nawe uziva ngendlela efanayo.
But this did not last long.	Kodwa oku akuzange kube kudala kwaphela.
This person is not there.	Akakho lo mntu.
I don’t understand why, really.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
Yes, it is done now.	Ewe, yenziwe ngoku.
He is the only way.	Nguye kuphela indlela.
I'm glad you are willing to help us.	Ndiyavuya uzimisele ukusinceda.
Always the same mistake.	Ngalo lonke ixesha impazamo enye.
Let me say a few things about this book.	Makhe ndithethe izinto ezimbalwa ngale ncwadi.
Or he did not want to.	Okanye wayengafuni.
He is present at that moment.	Ukhona kanye ngelo xesha.
I don't even know if he walked into the office.	Andazi nokuba uye wangena eofisini na.
Certainly not here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo apha.
That really does, really there.	Oko kuyenza ngokwenene, ngenene phaya.
Finally I know why.	Ekugqibeleni ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
Maybe something bad happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
Neither can you.	Nawe awukwazi.
This starts early.	Oku kuqala kwangethuba.
Everyone is trying to make money.	Wonke umntu uzama ukufumana imali.
This is definitely me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndim lo.
He knew now what was wrong.	Wayesazi ngoku ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Yonke into ilungile, yonke into ilungile.
Maybe he never got there.	Mhlawumbi akazange afike apho.
And you told him.	Kwaye umxelele.
But not so much right now.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu okwangoku.
This is not the case at all.	Ayisiyiyo le nto konke konke.
And you should know.	Kwaye kufuneka uyazi.
Next week is no better.	Kwiveki ezayo akukho ngcono.
I don't want to go anywhere.	Andifuni kuya ndawo.
To do that, you will need to be ready.	Ukuze wenze oko, kuya kufuneka ukuba ulungile.
I have never said it so clearly before.	Andizange ndithethe ngokucacileyo ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
Then he sat down and began to think.	Emva koko wahlala phantsi waza waqalisa ukucinga.
But it could also be better.	Kodwa kwakhona kunokuba ngcono.
But just in time.	Kodwa kanye ngexesha.
What is happening here? 	Kwenzeka ntoni apha?
He did not know that he was there.	Akazange azi ukuba ukhona.
He seemed to need help with her.	Wayekhangeleka efuna uncedo naye.
Not his job.	Hayi umsebenzi wakhe.
This, of course, is not very possible.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
Some really did not.	Abanye ngokwenene abazange.
Although he was not.	Nangona wayengekho.
That's the way we do things in our house.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo izinto endlwini yethu.
No one ever looked.	Akukho mntu wakha wajonga.
I'm looking for some.	Ndijonge ezinye.
He wanted to learn more.	Wayefuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
He does things his own way.	Wenza izinto ngendlela yakhe.
I would just like to.	Ndingathanda kuphela.
That means work for us.	Oko kuthetha umsebenzi kuthi.
So it had to be all or nothing.	Ngoko ke kwafuneka ukuba konke okanye akukho nto.
I'd like to do something about it.	Ndingathanda ukwenza into ngaloo nto.
And that is exactly what is happening here and now.	Kwaye yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha kwaye ngoku.
That happened later, for sure.	Oko kwenzeka kamva, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He finally decided to go.	Ekugqibeleni wagqiba kwelokuba ahambe.
That's what you want me to do.	Nantso into ofuna ndiyenze.
You do a little bit.	Wenza kancinci.
You thought too hard.	Ucinge nzima kakhulu.
Not you again.	Hayi wena kwakhona.
This, of course, never happened.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akuzange kwenzeke.
It can be even more fun.	Inokuba mnandi ngakumbi.
Probably the only one.	Mhlawumbi nguye kuphela.
Eventually he became completely inside her.	Ekugqibeleni waba ngaphakathi kuye ngokupheleleyo.
I'm not sure where it is now.	Andazi ncam ukuba iphi ngoku.
I have to go too.	Nam kufuneka ndihambe.
If it is.	Ukuba yiyo.
That, of course, is always the case.	Oko, kunjalo, kuhlala kunjalo.
No one knew why, or even if it was true.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kutheni, okanye nokuba yinyani.
And he tried to get out of there and he did.	Kwaye wazama ukuphuma apho kwaye wenza.
This is no problem.	Oku akukho ngxaki.
You have to buy a book.	Kufuneka uthenge incwadi.
My mother is interested.	Umama unomdla.
Not only now.	Akunjalo kuphela ngoku.
Definitely a must !!!.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka !!!.
Then you did just that.	Emva koko wenze kanye loo nto.
He's a really good man, you know.	Ungumntu olungileyo ngenene, uyazi.
Yes, it is difficult to earn money.	Ewe, kunzima ukufumana imali.
Again, really sorry.	Kwakhona, uxolo ngokwenene.
Or maybe go to her.	Okanye mhlawumbi uye kuye.
But he did not do it.	Kodwa akazange ayenze.
But so is the same problem.	Kodwa kunjalo ingxaki efanayo.
But also.	Kodwa kwakhona.
Almost too in it.	Phantse kakhulu kuyo.
And if it is me.	Kwaye ukuba ndim.
He slept through the night.	Walala ebusuku.
Now or never, then, he thought.	Ngoku okanye zange, ngoko, wacinga.
Help someone out.	Nceda umntu ngaphandle.
I'm really scared, you know.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene, uyazi.
Me and you, too.	Mna nawe, kwakhona.
Otherwise, you do not have to.	Ngaphandle koko, akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze njalo.
There was no reason for him to do so now.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba enjenjalo ngoku.
There is no one but everyone.	Kukho umntu ngaphandle kwakhe wonke umntu.
That's the answer.	Nantso impendulo.
And he went out.	Waphuma ke.
He wanted a dog.	Wayefuna inja.
This can only be a good thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto entle kuphela.
As soon as you like.	Kwangoko uthanda.
He had to do it.	Kwafuneka ayenze.
And then, you will not be able to stop.	Kwaye ke, awuyi kukwazi ukuyeka.
I have to stay here now.	Kufuneka ndihlale apha ngoku.
No one told me anything before.	Akukho mntu wandixelela nto ngaphambili.
I do everything with him.	Ndenza yonke into naye.
The fact is, he did.	Inyaniso kukuba wayenza.
You do not have to decide right away.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoko nangoko.
I know my daughter.	Ndiyayazi intombi yam.
Not you, not here, not now.	Hayi wena, hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
Now this is something new.	Ngoku le yinto entsha.
That was nothing after that.	Oko kwakungekho nto emva koko.
I'm scared too.	Nam ndiyoyika.
How are you going to do that? 	Uza kuyenza njani loo nto?
It really will be.	Ngokwenene kuya kuba njalo.
I did not look for time.	Khange ndijonge ixesha.
You want to be here and now.	Ufuna ukuba lapha kwaye ngoku.
Not a good name.	Hayi igama elihle.
Just because someone is there.	Kuba nje umntu abe khona.
Maybe you, too.	Mhlawumbi nawe, nawe.
Now, it seems you would like to be alone.	Ngoku, kubonakala ngathi ungathanda ukuba wedwa.
I'm glad to see you doing well.	Ndiyavuya ukubona uqhuba kakuhle.
It will have to be okay.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kulungile.
But in the meantime, you will be fine.	Kodwa okwangoku, uya kuba ulungile.
We want to do something.	Sifuna ukwenza into.
But you have money.	Kodwa unayo imali.
He returned to the car.	Wabuyela emotweni.
But it is good this way.	Kodwa kuhle ngale ndlela.
But that seemed like a long time ago.	Kodwa oko kwakubonakala ngathi kudala.
I sometimes make coffee.	Ndikhe ndiyenze ikofu.
I am convinced that this time it is true.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ngeli xesha yinyani.
You're working a little harder now.	Usebenza kancinci ngoku.
I've always wanted so much.	Bendisoloko ndifuna kakhulu.
He knows everything about you.	Wazi konke ngawe.
Two days, up.	Iintsuku ezimbini, phezulu.
You work slowly.	Usebenza kancinci.
We don't have to do all the work, either.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze wonke umsebenzi, nathi.
He speaks quickly, before he can.	Uthetha ngokukhawuleza, ngaphambi kokuba akwazi.
And a new hat, too.	Kwaye umnqwazi omtsha, kwakhona.
It would hurt my dad.	Bekuya kuba buhlungu utata.
If you play a lot, everyone should do the same.	Ukuba udlala kakhulu, wonke umntu kufuneka enze njalo.
He knows what he needs to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka ayenze.
So you have to go.	Ngoko kufuneka uhambe.
That is probably true.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi yinyani.
Sure he will now, but he never did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kwenza ngoku, kodwa akazange.
But somehow, he did not know.	Kodwa ngenye indlela, wayengazi.
You have done such a wonderful job.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle kangaka.
That is a new thing.	Yinto entsha leyo.
Up here long enough.	Phezulu apha ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
What is this.	Yintoni le nto.
He didn't want me to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ndithethe ngayo.
He didn't know what else it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni enye.
Great, too.	Enkulu, nayo.
I just wonder where you are here.	Ndiyazibuza nje ukuba uphi apha.
The same thing if you do something nice.	Into efanayo ukuba wenze into entle.
I make all this money.	Ndiyenza yonke le mali.
You better do something about it.	Kungcono wenze into ngayo.
It will be better than nothing.	Kuya kuba ngcono kunokuba akukho nto.
But he did.	Kodwa lowo wenza.
Finally, she told me two things.	Ekugqibeleni, wandixelela izinto ezimbini.
But nothing is easy.	Kodwa akukho nto iza lula.
And someone will say something.	Kwaye umntu uya kuthetha into.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, wandixelela.
Or speak frankly.	Okanye uthethe ngokucacileyo.
Do not pretend to be someone else.	Musa ukwenza ngathi ngenye indlela.
He has sat there, unable to walk.	Uye wahlala apho, akakwazi ukuhamba.
They will both stay in the hospital overnight.	Bobabini baya kuhlala esibhedlele ubusuku bonke.
I never thought it would be easy.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba lula.
As he wanted to die.	Njengoko wayefuna ukufa.
Mother in a hospital bed.	Umama ebhedini esibhedlele.
He loves his mother.	Uyamthanda umama wakhe.
I thought you probably knew.	Bendicinga ukuba mhlawumbi uyazi.
He may already be here.	Inokuba sele elapha.
But tell me about it.	Kodwa ndixelele ngayo.
He can do it, too.	Angayenza, naye.
You have told many people this.	Uxelele abantu abaninzi oku.
You can do it anytime.	Ungayenza nanini na.
He goes there, too.	Uya phaya, naye.
I will come later.	Ndiza kuza emva koko.
He would come here.	Wayeza kuza apha.
But not if you want to.	Kodwa akunjalo ukuba ufuna.
Every day to work.	Yonke imihla ukuya emsebenzini.
You just sit in time.	Uhleli nje ngexesha.
So, he's sitting there.	Ngoko, uhleli apho.
Absolutely poor performance.	Ukusebenza kakubi ngokupheleleyo.
He also gave me a plan.	Kwakhona wandinika icebo.
I can't wait for next week.	Andikwazi ukulinda iveki ezayo.
They both live together.	Bahlala bobabini kunye.
I need to know.	Kufuneka ndikwazi.
Just at the beginning, and again.	Kanye nje ekuqaleni, kwaye kwakhona.
A gun, perhaps.	Umpu, mhlawumbi.
I look forward to talking to you next week.	Ndijonge phambili ukuthetha nawe kwiveki ezayo.
We certainly want more children.	Ngokuqinisekileyo sifuna abantwana abaninzi.
I walked over to her.	Ndihambe ndiye kuye.
Maybe that's why you're here.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto ulapha.
Immediately in the office.	Kwangoko eofisini.
It was not hard to see why.	Kwakungekho nzima ukubona ukuba kutheni.
In any.	Kuyo nayiphi na .
Because he did everything he wanted to do.	Kuba wenza yonke into ayifunayo.
So what's the problem ?.	Khona yintoni ingxaki?.
It must be, to know your mother.	Kumele kube, ukwazi umama wakho.
It will continue to be so.	Kuya kuqhubeka kunjalo.
He did it then.	Uyenzile emva koko.
But you told me enough.	Kodwa undixelele ngokwaneleyo.
It seems so real.	Kubonakala ngathi kunjalo ngokwenene.
And he says.	Kwaye uthi .
I'll get that soon.	Ndiza kufumana oko kungekudala.
He never had this problem.	Akazange abe nayo le ngxaki.
He is your greatest.	Nguye omkhulu wakho.
But he promised to come back.	Kodwa wathembisa ukuba uza kubuya.
He can play.	Uyakwazi ukudlala .
We help you.	Siza kuwe .
Playing now.	Ukudlala ngoku.
Therefore, children will be able to get out of school.	Ngoko ke, abantwana baya kukwazi ukuphuma esikolweni.
For dinner .	Ngesidlo sangokuhlwa .
I think that might be the case.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba yiloo nto.
But it is also not necessary.	Kodwa kwakhona akufuneki.
We want the whole story.	Sifuna ibali lonke.
We know this is not the case.	Siyazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
But you read it fast.	Kodwa ufunda ngokukhawuleza.
What did he think of her.	Wacinga ntoni ngaye.
Not so with him, obviously.	Akunjalo ngaye, ngokucacileyo.
But it seemed a long time ago.	Kodwa kwakubonakala kudala kakhulu.
He will go with her.	Uya kuhamba naye.
It will do it tomorrow.	Iza kuyenza ngomso.
With that, he will do it.	Ngaloo nto, uya kuyenza.
Outside there is no place, no time.	Ngaphandle akukho ndawo, akukho xesha.
I can speak there.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha apho.
I do that every day.	Ndenza oko yonke imihla.
Anyone who wants to have children.	Nabani na ofuna ukuba nabantwana.
He seems to be always looking for food.	Ubonakala ngathi uhlala efuna ukutya.
You know, then.	Uyazi, ngoko.
Maybe I can do this.	Mhlawumbi ndingayenza le nto.
But now he was afraid.	Kodwa ngoku wayesoyika.
All, or almost.	Bonke, okanye phantse.
He's like me, you know.	Ufana nam, uyazi.
And all the way back.	Kwaye yonke indlela emva.
Because, well, it's the same thing.	Kuba, ke, yinto enye.
But here we are both.	Kodwa apha sobabini.
I could not do this without your help.	Andikwazanga ukwenza oku ngaphandle koncedo lwakho.
No one has to make any phone calls.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze nayiphi na ifowuni.
And there is a car.	Kwaye kukho imoto.
Great mistake today.	Impazamo enkulu namhlanje.
Nothing happened yesterday.	Izolo akukho nto yenzekileyo.
Just at this time.	Kanye ngeli xesha.
So that's a mistake there.	Ngoko ke impazamo apho.
I think there is a great truth in this.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho inyaniso enkulu kule nto.
This, this and so on.	Oku, oku kwaye njalo.
He did not stay.	Zange ahlale.
Or all that money.	Okanye yonke loo mali.
The other dog is fine.	Enye inja ilungile.
He will say anything.	Uya kuthetha nantoni na.
That was evident.	Kwakubonakala oko.
Yes, this will do well.	Ewe, oku kuya kwenza kakuhle.
If you go.	Ukuba uya .
New problem.	Ingxaki entsha.
Thank you for being good to her.	Enkosi ngokuba ulungile kuye.
I know you did.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyenzile.
But it will come.	Kodwa iza kufika.
It's true, that way.	Yinyani, ngaloo ndlela.
Everyone knew something.	Wonke umntu wayesazi into.
Maybe knowing everything about something.	Mhlawumbi kukwazi yonke into ngento ethile.
All to me, my fault.	Konke kum, ityala lam.
I think it will happen for a long time.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka ixesha elide.
See if you did.	Jonga ukuba uyenzile na.
One mistake and everyone knows it.	Impazamo enye kwaye wonke umntu uyazi ngayo.
I want to see what you think.	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I'm so glad to have you here.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba nawe apha.
He will stay with me now.	Uza kuhlala nam ngoku.
He asked me to stay here.	Wandicela ukuba ndihlale apha.
I have tried this method too.	Ndiye ndazama le ndlela kwaye.
He stayed in the house for two weeks.	Wahlala endlini iiveki ezimbini.
She loves the way he made you feel.	Uyayithanda indlela akwenze waziva ngayo.
A new day will come.	Kuya kufika imini entsha.
You will be the first to tell me that.	Uya kuba ngowokuqala ukukuxelela loo nto.
It always is the same for you.	Kuhlala kunjalo kuwe.
We need to do it regularly.	Kufuneka siyenze rhoqo.
She is a local person.	Ungumntu wasekhaya.
No one speaks.	Akukho mntu uthetha.
I have to think of something else.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngenye into.
No one spoke to me.	Akukho mntu wathetha nam.
I want to talk to her now.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye ngoku.
Finally, he died.	Ekugqibeleni, wafa.
His work will come first.	Umsebenzi wakhe uza kuqala.
You should not have come here.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba uze apha.
But my mother stays there all the time.	Kodwa umama uhlala apho ngalo lonke ixesha.
It's completely over.	Kwaphela ngokupheleleyo.
They both said they did not.	Bobabini bathi abazange.
He didn't think he would be far away for long.	Wayengacingi ukuba uza kuba kude ixesha elide.
But that seems possible.	Kodwa oko kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
It is unlikely that this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba yenzeke.
Yes, my mother.	Ewe, umama wam.
That is how death comes.	Kuza ngaloo ndlela ke ukufa.
But, he had to leave.	Kodwa, kwafuneka ahambe.
One day, maybe.	Ngenye imini, mhlawumbi.
Much has been made of it.	Yenziwe okuninzi kuyo.
You should be right, though.	Ufanele ukuba ulungile, nangona kunjalo.
And stop talking about it.	Kwaye yeka ukuthetha ngayo.
I don't have to tell you that.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ndikuxelele loo nto.
I am always tired.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ndidiniwe.
Very, very quickly.	Kakhulu, ngokukhawuleza.
He did not know anyone in town.	Wayengazi mntu edolophini.
He entered the place.	Wangena kuloo ndawo.
I think you have succeeded.	Ndicinga ukuba uphumelele.
Soon, someone will come to visit.	Kungekudala, kuza kufika umntu.
He's just doing his thing.	Uyayenza nje into yakhe.
My wife is interested.	Umfazi wam unomdla.
One you probably know, one maybe not.	Enye mhlawumbi uyazi, enye mhlawumbi hayi.
He has to do it regularly.	Kufuneka ayenze rhoqo.
Very fast and very fast.	Kakhulu kwaye ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
This is exactly what it is here.	Yile nto kanye apha.
He works that way.	Usebenza ngolo hlobo.
I would really like to say that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuyithetha loo nto.
Unless you don't want to go there.	Ngaphandle kokuba awufuni ukuya apho.
He goes the other way.	Uhamba ngenye indlela.
It seemed like a long time ago.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kudala.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba loo nto.
Thank you so much for this.	Enkosi kakhulu ngale nto.
He should have eaten with her.	Bekufanele atye naye.
You don't want to do too many things.	Awufuni ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
But you will not start until tomorrow.	Kodwa awuyi kuqala kude kube kusasa.
He looks very bad.	Ukhangeleka embi kakhulu.
Not there at this time.	Akukho apho ngeli xesha.
Maybe he wanted to eat.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukutya.
I didn't want to do it either.	Nam ndandingafuni ukwenza.
But marriage.	Kodwa umtshato .
I know how bad that is.	Ndiyazi indlela embi ngayo loo nto.
Maybe he shouldn't have said anything.	Mhlawumbi bekungafanelanga athethe nto.
Or a question.	Okanye umbuzo.
You should not talk to anyone right now.	Akufunekanga uthethe nabani ngoku.
There is no one or the other.	Akukho namnye okanye omnye.
Don't go in front of me, now.	Musa ukuya phambi kwam, ngoku.
And about him.	Kwaye malunga naye.
There was no need for him to say anything.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba athethe nto .
It is clear that you are here for him.	Kucacile ukuba ulapha kuye.
He can't think of his voice.	Akakwazi ukucinga ilizwi lakhe.
You immediately bought a debt from it.	Ngoko nangoko uthenge ityala kuyo.
I didn't do it yesterday.	Khange ndiyenze izolo.
See if you can.	Jonga ukuba ukhona na.
Not the way you did it.	Hayi indlela owenze ngayo.
He thought of something small all night.	Wacinga ngenye into encinci ubusuku bonke.
Nobody ever talked about it.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngaloo nto.
Tell all your friends.	Xelela bonke abahlobo bakho.
My mother came with me that morning.	Umama weza nam ngaloo ntsasa.
Now he also knew.	Ngoku naye wayesazi.
You should have watched with us.	Bekufanele ujonge nathi.
Don't do too much, too fast.	Musa ukwenza kakhulu, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Well, tell me it isn't.	Ke, ndixelele ukuba akunjalo.
He looked up quickly.	Wajonga ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want you to tell anyone.	Andifuni uxelele mntu.
And because he still thought of her.	Kwaye kuba nangoku wayecinga ngaye.
So he just fell asleep.	Ngoko walala nje.
You can be, too.	Unokuba njalo, nawe.
Also in bed.	Kwakhona ebhedini.
You will not want that to happen.	Awuyi kufuna ukuba oko kwenzeke.
This did not happen here.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke apha.
And maybe you want to be with him.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ufuna ukuba naye.
But now something good has happened.	Kodwa ngoku kukho into entle eyenzekileyo.
In fact, he could not wait.	Ngokwenene, akazange akwazi ukulinda.
I doubt how far they will go, but we will see.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba baya kuhamba kangakanani, kodwa siza kubona.
I did not want to.	bendingafuni.
Not in a bad way, though.	Hayi ngendlela embi, nangona kunjalo.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
He wanted things.	Wayefuna izinto.
I know the woman better now.	Ndiyamazi ngcono umfazi ngoku.
Everyone together now.	Wonke umntu kunye ngoku.
He just didn't want to be there.	Wayengafuni nje ukuba lapho.
It has to be really better.	Kufuneka kube ngcono ngokwenene.
Well, he tried.	Kuhle, wazama.
He did not want her to think anything bad.	Wayengafuni ukuba acinge nantoni na embi.
But she has to go to the hospital.	Kodwa kufuneka aye esibhedlele.
This is not me! 	Ayindim lo!
Tell me how this happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
I want no problem here.	Andifuni ngxaki apha.
And the same thing happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into efanayo.
No problem, obviously.	Akukho ngxaki, ngokucacileyo.
Maybe now is the time.	Mhlawumbi ngoku lixesha.
However, all is well.	Nangona kunjalo, konke kulungile.
Yes, it could be, yes.	Ewe, inokuba, ewe.
I hope it is true though.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani nangona kunjalo.
Really, there is no problem.	Ngokwenene, akukho ngxaki enye.
You want to know the truth.	Ufuna ukwazi inyaniso.
But it will happen now.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka ngoku.
If you can't, it doesn't.	Ukuba awukwazi, akunjalo.
That is unlikely to happen anytime soon, though.	Akunakwenzeka oko ukuba kwenzeke kungekudala, nangona kunjalo.
I can't stay home.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ekhaya.
We need to know.	Kufuneka siyazi.
She is doing well in school.	Uqhuba kakuhle esikolweni.
I wanted to make my time.	Ndandifuna ukwenza ixesha lam.
I would very much like someone to do that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba umntu enze loo nto.
I can't tell you everything.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela konke.
We did that at the same time.	Senze oko ngexesha elinye.
Something about you.	Into ngawe.
He said yes, he did.	Wathi ewe, uyenzile.
One that you have to go to every day.	Enye ekufuneka uye kuyo yonke imihla.
This is my job, now.	Lo ngumsebenzi wam, ngoku.
I'm happy too.	Ndiyavuya nam.
There, always.	Kukho, rhoqo.
She is well dressed, well spoken.	Unxibe kakuhle, uthethe kakuhle.
You will have to do one or the other.	Kuya kufuneka wenze enye okanye enye.
He looked back immediately.	Wajonga emva kwangoko.
You don't have to look at it.	Akufunekanga ujonge kuyo.
There is no one way.	Akukho ndlela enye.
She is smart with him.	Ukrelekrele naye.
We'll see how this happens !.	Siza kubona ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka njani!.
He always comes.	Uza rhoqo.
Well this may be it.	Kulungile oku kunokuba yiyo.
However, there is another way.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho enye indlela.
Good as before.	Kuhle njengakuqala.
He pretends to be scared to death by her.	Wenza ngathi uyoyika ukufa nguye.
It’s a job, after all.	Ngumsebenzi, emva koko.
Well, you should know.	Ewe, kufuneka uyazi.
We will do that later.	Siya kuyenza loo nto kamva.
We will try again.	Siza kuzama kwakhona.
It seemed okay.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kulungile.
No one but you, you know.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle kwakho, uyazi.
Now, you better sit down.	Ngoku, kungcono uhlale phantsi.
My mother tried to have more children.	Umama wazama ukuba nabantwana abaninzi.
Well, not everything.	Ewe, hayi yonke into.
You have not thought about it much.	Khange ucinge ngayo kakhulu.
Because everyone does it.	Kuba wonke umntu uyayenza.
You will need to draw a picture.	Kuya kufuneka wenze umfanekiso.
He wanted her to stay.	Wayefuna ukuba ahlale.
Whether he wanted to or not.	Nokuba wayefuna okanye akafuni.
I think I am really with you.	Ndicinga ukuba ndim nawe ngokwenene.
My daughter is coming home.	Intombi yam iza ekhaya.
At the time, he did not know.	Ngelo xesha, wayengazi.
He told me he wanted money.	Wandixelela ukuba ufuna imali.
Not at all.	Akukho konke konke.
Just really successful to get there.	Ukuphumelela nje ngenene ukufika apho.
Maybe you don't want to talk.	Mhlawumbi awufuni kuthetha.
I can tell you.	Ndiyakwazi ukukuxelela.
I want it to be my thing.	Ndifuna ukuba yinto yam.
Everyone needs to be able to work together.	Wonke umntu kufuneka akwazi ukusebenza kunye.
If you like it, don't take anything for granted.	Ukuba uyayithanda, musa ukuthatha nantoni na.
If not, you will go.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kuhamba.
I want you still.	Ndifuna wena nangoku.
Another woman, alone.	Omnye umfazi, yedwa.
Well, it's not possible, it really does take time.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka, ngokwenene ngokwenene kuthatha ixesha.
I wanted to know why.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
You only have to do one.	Kufuneka wenze enye kuphela.
So you have that.	Ngoko unayo loo nto.
You will be tired.	Uya kuba udiniwe.
He rarely speaks.	Akafane athethe.
I want to do two things.	Ndifuna ukwenza izinto ezimbini.
I really do, with the kids.	Ndenza ngokwenene, kunye nabantwana.
I am all the time.	Ndim ngalo lonke ixesha.
I would love to read and learn more.	Ndingathanda ukufunda kwaye ndifunde ngakumbi.
However, he wasted time.	Nangona kunjalo, wachitha ixesha.
And if you feel better, you will do better.	Kwaye ukuba uziva ngcono, uya kwenza ngcono.
He came down hard.	Wehla ngamandla.
Always on him.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kuye.
He is happy too.	Naye uyavuya.
Lots of coffee.	Ikofu eninzi.
There is nothing else in the room.	Akukho enye into egumbini.
Let me do it again.	Makhe ndiyenze kwakhona loo nto.
Going forward.	Uya phambili uya phambili.
He thought that maybe not.	Wacinga ukuba mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Really good work there.	Umsebenzi omhle ngenene apho.
A week, maybe soon.	Iveki, mhlawumbi kungekudala.
There is no reason for that to happen.	Akukho sizathu sokuba oko kwenzeke.
Now we come to it.	Ngoku siza kuyo.
Making a party all the time.	Ukwenza itheko lonke ixesha.
Now it's much better.	Ngoku kungcono kakhulu.
She told my parents.	Waxelela abazali bam.
It’s hard to be both.	Kunzima ukuba bobabini.
However, there is something unusual about it.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho into engaqhelekanga ngayo.
Not so at the time.	Akunjalo kangako ngelo xesha.
To me, it never was.	Kum, akuzange kube njalo.
However, it did not happen.	Nangona kunjalo, akuzange kwenzeke.
He knew immediately who he was.	Wayesazi ngoko nangoko ukuba ngubani.
I have known this for a long time.	Kudala ndiyazi le nto.
Obviously very quickly.	Ngokucacileyo ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
It will not always be so.	Akuyi kuhlala kunjalo.
There seems to be something about it.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into malunga nayo.
And money is a thing.	Kwaye imali yinto.
And he loves everyone.	Kwaye uthanda wonke umntu.
There was no problem, after all.	Kwakungekho ngxaki, emva koko.
I forgot breakfast.	Ndilibele isidlo sakusasa.
You can't go there.	Awunako ukuya apho.
I was thinking about something yesterday.	Bendicinga ngento izolo.
I mean finish.	Ndithetha ukugqiba.
don't be like that.	musa ukuba njalo.
The parents now live together.	Abazali ngoku bahlala kunye.
I thought you might want to know that.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda ukwazi oko.
For even now.	Kuba nangoku.
He is waiting for the opportunity.	Ulindele ithuba.
But you want money.	Kodwa ufuna imali.
But enough for this.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo oku.
We will definitely do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuyenza loo nto.
Money or no money.	Imali okanye akukho mali.
I had no idea what he wanted.	Ndandingazi ukuba ufuna ntoni.
He just thought something was happening.	Wacinga nje ukuba kwenzeka into ethile.
Man, and so on.	Umntu, njalo njalo.
Nobody lives there now.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho ngoku.
Really, really you can’t.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene awukwazi.
Maybe he wanted it too fast.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna kakhulu ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
What hurts you.	Yintoni ekwenza buhlungu.
There was nothing else to do here.	Kwakungekho enye into yokwenza apha.
I'll come back later.	Ndiza kubuya kamva.
He was the first to do it.	Waba ngowokuqala ukuyenza.
It will come back again.	Iza kubuya kwakhona.
You want money with it.	Ufuna imali ngayo.
I think there is something out there.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into ethile phaya.
That was totally unnecessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko kwaphela.
I want a big wedding.	Ndifuna umtshato omkhulu.
Maybe something happened to him.	Mhlawumbi kukho into eyenzekileyo kuye.
I'll be right back.	Ndiza kuza ngokukhawuleza.
I do not know exactly who this is.	Andazi ncam ukuba ngubani lo .
He wants his money.	Ufuna imali yakhe.
I know how you like to do that.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthanda ukwenza njani oko.
Or almost at home.	Okanye phantse ekhaya.
It is difficult to succeed.	Kunzima ukuphumelela.
No matter what you feel.	Nokuba uziva ngantoni.
bad.	embi.
But that is good enough.	Kodwa oko kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
Or maybe this never happened.	Okanye mhlawumbi le nto ayizange yenzeke.
Of course, time and time again.	Kunjalo, ixesha kunye nexesha kwakhona.
This happened just before.	Oku kwenzeke kanye ngaphambili.
And now they will talk about it.	Kwaye ke ngoku baza kuthetha ngayo.
He should think of me that way.	Kufuneka acinge ngam ngolo hlobo.
Well, you know very well.	Ewe, wazi kakhulu.
He didn't, either.	Akazange, naye.
The man did not think straight.	Umntu khange acinge kakuhle.
You do not have to think about him.	Akufunekanga ucinge ngaye.
I do not remember, long ago.	Andikhumbuli, kudala kakhulu.
I have seen many.	Ndibone ezininzi.
Not to replace.	Hayi ukuthatha indawo.
Or it could be very bad.	Okanye kunokwenzeka kakhulu ngendlela embi.
No, of course not.	Hayi mna kunjalo.
Or years.	Okanye iminyaka.
It should be easy to do.	Kufuneka kube lula ukwenza.
He can't stay here all the time.	Akakwazi ukuhlala apha lonke ixesha.
More, more, more.	Ngakumbi, ngakumbi, ngakumbi.
It also should not be.	Kwakhona akufanele kube.
And then there are the people.	Kwaye ke kukho abantu.
I wonder why he is here.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni elapha.
But, what.	Kodwa, yintoni na.
If you read.	Ukuba ufunda.
To me, you are telling the truth.	Kum, uthetha inyani.
He came right up to me.	Weza kum kanye.
That's very good.	Kuhle kakhulu oko.
Until tomorrow for sure.	Kude kube ngomso ngokuqinisekileyo.
I wanted to help other people.	Ndandifuna ukunceda abanye abantu.
But this is not entirely possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
Next to me.	Ecaleni kwam.
Soon he arrived.	Zange kube kudala wafika.
It's all in me, just like me.	Konke kum ngaphakathi kwam, njengam nje.
No, not at all.	Akunjalo, kwaphela.
We want him to be.	Sifuna ukuba abe njalo.
Unless there is one problem.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho ingxaki enye.
Don't do something big.	Musa ukwenza into enkulu.
I looked up at the same time everyone was doing.	Ndijonge phezulu ngexesha elinye wonke umntu esenza.
I don't want to take your gun.	Andifuni ukuthatha umpu wakho.
I could not decide what to do.	Andizange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba ndenze ntoni.
I will do my homework.	Ndiza kwenza umsebenzi wam wasekhaya.
When he says something he does it.	Xa ethetha into uyayenza.
He is sitting with me now.	Uhleli nam ngoku.
I never thought about it before.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo ngaphambili.
So this is a question for you.	Ngoko ke lo mbuzo kuwe.
Not a mistake.	Hayi impazamo.
That would be very unusual.	Iya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu leyo.
Maybe we will buy a house.	Mhlawumbi siza kuthenga indlu.
So much for the whole week.	Kakhulu iveki yonke.
I hope your daughter is fine.	Ndiyathemba ukuba intombi yakho ilungile.
One must, of course.	Umntu kufuneka, kunjalo.
Really, it is impossible.	Ngokwenene, akunakwenzeka.
We will do that now.	Siza kuyenza loo nto ngoku.
I will wait as long as you like.	Ndiza kulinda ixesha elide njengoko uthanda.
He does and he doesn’t like it.	Uyayenza kwaye akayithandi.
Please come here, whoever it is! 	Nceda uze apha, nokuba ngubani na!
And this seems to be the case.	Kwaye oku kubonakala kunjalo.
He didn't think he was good at anything.	Wayengacingi ukuba ulungile kwanto.
He would return as soon as possible.	Wayeza kubuya ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
Not until later.	Hayi kude kube mva.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono kungekudala.
Every morning.	Rhoqo kusasa.
Everything in the end.	Yonke into ekugqibeleni.
You know how that happened.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
You love your money.	Uyayithanda imali yakho.
We have to leave tomorrow.	Kufuneka sihambe kusasa.
But it's good to be here with my friends.	Kodwa kuhle ukuba lapha nabahlobo bam.
He wants to talk to you.	Unqwenela ukuthetha nawe.
I want to talk to her again.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye kwakhona.
That's the phone.	Nantso ifowuni.
We'll talk again soon.	Siza kuthetha kwakhona kungekudala.
What? 	Oko?
I did not see for long.	Andizange ndibone ixesha elide.
Then he went back inside.	Emva koko wabuyela ngaphakathi.
I could not get out.	Andikwazanga ukuphuma.
But everything.	Kodwa yonke into.
But he would try.	Kodwa wayeza kuzama.
He said he wanted his place.	Wathi ufuna indawo yakhe.
So he can't walk.	Ngoko akakwazi ukuhamba.
Finding the truth.	Ukufumana inyaniso.
Please see the error.	Nceda ndibone impazamo.
I wonder why?.	Ingaba kutheni?.
He did not do it alone.	Akazange ayenze yedwa.
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinto entle na.
I want to go with you.	Ndifuna ukuhamba nawe.
He lives with us here.	Uhlala nathi apha.
I feel the same way.	Nam ndiziva ngolu hlobo.
Then he obviously decided to tell me.	Emva koko kucacile wagqiba ekubeni andixelele.
I hope you know how lucky you are.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani na.
But that certainly does not have to be.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
But he didn't know much.	Kodwa wayengazi kangako.
He just walked out.	Uye waphuma nje.
I don't think this will happen anytime soon.	Andiqondi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
I told her, no.	Ndamxelela, hayi.
That is why he was not at home.	Yiyo loo nto wayengekho ekhaya.
I will try to get better.	Ndiza kuzama ukuba ngcono.
They will stay here.	Baya kuhlala apha.
I think very yes.	Ndicinga kakhulu ewe.
I look bad.	Ndijonge kakubi.
It can be very fun.	Kunokuba mnandi kakhulu.
Thanks for all the help.	Enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo.
As together.	Njengoko kunye.
This seems very difficult.	Oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
And then! 	Ke ngoku!
Or any other way.	Okanye nayiphi na enye indlela.
I want to be in this.	Ndifuna ukuba kule.
Slightly hard to find.	Kancinci kunzima ukufumana.
Do not speak at this time.	Musa ukuthetha ngeli xesha.
I do not want to read.	Andifuni ukufunda.
I think that's really it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto ngokwenene.
That's exactly right.	Yiloo nto kanye inyaniso.
It seems like one way or another.	Kubonakala ngathi enye indlela enye.
And all in all, in the end it will be fine.	Kwaye konke, ekugqibeleni kuya kuba kuhle.
He said, all right.	Wathi, kulungile.
I thought you could run a restaurant.	Bendicinga ukuba uyakwazi ukuqhuba indawo yokutyela.
Everyone knows about it, everyone.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngayo, wonke umntu.
But we know that this is not the case.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
He will have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngayo.
He meant the people.	Wayethetha abantu.
I can walk alone.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba ndedwa.
I knew he could control himself.	Ndandisazi ukuba uyakwazi ukuzibamba.
I have learned a lot from working with him.	Ndifunde okuninzi ukusebenza naye.
I want you to go.	Ndifuna uhamba.
No one talks too much.	Akukho mntu uthetha kakhulu.
But tonight, we're going to do some things.	Kodwa ngokuhlwanje, siza kwenza ezinye izinto.
But it looks the other way.	Kodwa kubonakala ngenye indlela.
At present it is not.	Okwangoku akunjalo.
Because if you do.	Kuba ukuba wenza.
I forgot to do my homework.	Ndilibele ukwenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo.
That would be the complete opposite of that.	Oko bekuya kuba ecaleni ngokupheleleyo koko.
Not to me, but to me.	Hayi kum, kodwa kum.
Well then we're not going anywhere.	Kulungile ke asiyi ndawo.
After all, you probably do not want to.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi awufuni.
But this one stayed.	Kodwa lo wahlala.
What happens to everyone.	Kwenzeka ntoni wonke umntu.
Fast moving.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
No one bought anything.	Akukho mntu uthenge nto.
But because there was nothing else.	Kodwa ngenxa yokuba kwakungekho enye into.
I will do it later.	Ndiza kuyenza emva koko.
No I was not alone.	Hayi zange wedwa.
I thought about you a lot.	Ndicinge ngawe kakhulu.
I think back now and I wonder why.	Ndicinga emva ngoku kwaye ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni.
We do not have to make a decision now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba senze isigqibo ngoku.
As always.	Njengoko kuhlala kunjalo.
One yesterday and another this afternoon.	Enye izolo enye ngale njikalanga.
Tell me why again.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni kwakhona.
He really wants to help.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukunceda.
He asked for time.	Wabuza ixesha.
But only if it is really good.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba ilungile ngokwenene.
Nobody is going to do that.	Akukho mntu uya kuyenza loo nto.
Yeah, tell me about it.	Ewe, ndixelele ngayo.
He fled at that moment.	Wabaleka ngelo xesha.
I wanted life.	Ndandifuna ubomi.
He doesn't think before he does anything.	Akacingi phambi kokuba enze nantoni na.
There is no money to do.	Kukho nayiphi na imali yokwenza.
So it is good that it is good.	Ngoko kuhle ukuba ilungile.
I now.	Mna ngoku.
Someone will be with you soon.	Umntu uza kuba nawe kungekudala.
If you are, you are.	Ukuba ukhona, unjalo.
Very nice!.	Kuhle kakhulu!.
I can't wait until next time.	Andikwazi kulinda de kube lixesha elizayo.
There is something wrong with her, though.	Kukho into engalunganga ngaye, nangona kunjalo.
They will arrive on time.	Baza kufika ngexesha.
You do not have to talk to us.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe nathi.
He plays football fast.	Udlala ibhola ngokukhawuleza.
But alone.	Kodwa yedwa.
And he must succeed.	Kwaye kufuneka aphumelele.
So thank you !.	Ngoko enkosi!.
He would love to do it.	Angathanda ukuyenza.
And that's not all.	Kwaye akukho konke.
No reason, no how.	Akukho sizathu, akukho njani.
But now everything is fine.	Kodwa ngoku yonke into ilungile.
He came in behind her.	Wangena emva kwakhe.
Well, he was very thoughtful.	Ewe, wayecinga kakhulu.
I did not want to talk.	Bendingafuni kuthetha.
You are not going either.	Nawe awuyi.
And you can be.	Kwaye unokuba njalo.
So I am not the only one.	Ngoko ayindim kuphela.
I never knew anything like that.	Andizange ndiyazi into enje.
Just after breakfast.	Kanye emva kwesidlo sakusasa.
What is wrong with it.	Yintoni engalunganga ngayo.
I like that better.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto ngcono.
Talking is good.	Ukuthetha kulungile.
Maybe for you.	Mhlawumbi kuwe.
I'll try to get some soon.	Ndiza kuzama ukufumana ezinye kungekudala.
Not really, though.	Akunjalo ngokwenene, nangona kunjalo.
And she eats a lot.	Kwaye utya kakhulu.
Like, way forward.	Njengokuba, indlela phambili.
I just know the truth is a good thing.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba inyaniso yinto entle.
All this is you.	Konke oku nguwe.
Soon though.	Kungekudala kodwa.
Her son is now running this place.	Unyana wakhe ngoku uqhuba le ndawo.
not so much yet.	hayi kakhulu okwangoku.
Nothing will happen until he wants it to happen.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka de afune ukuba yenzeke.
That seemed more likely.	Oko kwakubonakala kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
It should be easy to find.	Kumele kube lula ukufumana.
I look forward to seeing everyone.	Ndijonge phambili ukubona wonke umntu.
It is difficult to find a reason.	Kunzima ukufumana isizathu.
Today is not me.	Namhlanje ayindim.
I think we should do it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze.
Although he did not, either.	Nangona engazange, naye.
You do not know that he did.	Awuyazi ukuba wenza njalo.
This seems to be going well.	Oku kubonakala kuhamba kakuhle.
I don't want that in my class.	Andifuni oko eklasini yam.
You read one.	Ufunda enye.
That takes time to make me tell you.	Oko kuthatha ixesha ukwenza ndikuxelele.
Not far from him.	Hayi de kuye.
I didn’t see anything this time, though.	Andizange ndibone nto ngeli xesha, nangona kunjalo.
But nothing like this ever happened.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke into enje.
Don't wait to get home.	Musa ukulinda ukufika ekhaya.
He did not cause any accidents.	Akazange enze ngozi.
He really wanted to know.	Wayefuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
He asked where they lived.	Wabuza apho bahlala khona.
I will try this.	Ndiza kuzama oku.
But with us.	Kodwa kunye nathi.
Everything and everything.	Yonke into nayo yonke into.
It will happen but slowly.	Kuya kwenzeka kodwa kancinci.
I will get another job.	Ndiza kufumana omnye umsebenzi.
And you sure are not.	Kwaye uqinisekile ukuba akunjalo.
That's just one thing.	Oko kanye kuphela.
It can be very painful.	Inokuba buhlungu kakhulu.
She told me a little about him.	Wandixelela kancinci ngaye.
He always does this.	Usoloko ekwenza oku.
I'm thinking of leaving.	Ndicinga ukuhamba.
I know I am.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba ndim.
So tell people about it.	Ngoko xelela abantu ngayo.
And they will do just that.	Kwaye baya kwenza kanye loo nto .
I told her, no.	Ndamxelela, akukho.
Again, not our way.	Kwakhona, hayi indlela yethu.
He never gave up, though.	Akazange ayeke, nangona kunjalo.
I never did, you know.	Andizange ndiyenze, uyazi.
But, you are good at it.	Kodwa, ulungile kuyo.
that's it.	yiyo leyo.
And eventually he will return.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni uya kubuya.
It is difficult or impossible.	Kunzima ke okanye nokuba.
That's everywhere.	Yiyo yonke indawo.
But he learned nothing.	Kodwa akazange afunde nto.
He said something about.	Wathetha into malunga .
And be here in time.	Kwaye ube lapha ngexesha.
He gave me his voice.	Wandinika ilizwi lakhe.
Otherwise or anything.	Ngaphandle koko okanye nantoni na.
This is his thing and he really wants to do it.	Le yinto yakhe kwaye ufuna ngokwenene ukuyenza.
This is exactly what he did.	Lo wenza kanye loo nto.
He did not want to be alone.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa.
One will speak at the end.	Umntu uya kuthetha ekugqibeleni.
There is nothing here for you.	Akukho nto apha kuwe.
Shortly thereafter, he entered.	Kungekudala emva koko, wangena.
One day, maybe, but not now.	Ngenye imini, mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi ngoku.
That should not be over you.	Oko akufanele kube ngaphezu kwakho.
The woman walks alone.	Umfazi uhamba yedwa.
Just getting to know again.	Ukufumana nje ukwazi kwakhona.
No one likes to die.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukufa.
It will be good for now.	Kuya kuba kuhle okwangoku.
He didn't want to play.	Wayengafuni ukudlala.
He almost did.	Uphantse waba njalo.
For all of us, really.	Kuthi sonke, ngokwenene.
You only plan.	Uceba kuphela.
Don't forget about us.	Ungalibali ngathi.
He saw only two.	Wabona ezimbini kuphela.
The doctor left.	Wemka ugqirha.
He said he does.	Uthe uyayenza.
But not inside.	Kodwa hayi ngaphakathi.
Or not to me.	Okanye hayi kum.
Because you think it will.	Ngenxa yokuba ucinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He thought it might be this person.	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguye lo mntu .
I can’t stop thinking about this.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngale nto.
I want you, and only you.	Ndifuna wena, kwaye wena kuphela.
Because what, it's hard to say.	Kuba yintoni na, kunzima ukuthetha.
I thought this was impossible.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
Well, it took a long time to decide.	Ewe, wathatha ixesha elide ukwenza isigqibo.
I thought only of him.	Ndandicinga ngaye kuphela.
My father is not here.	Utata akakho.
No need to wait.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ulinde.
He just does the right thing all the time.	Wenza nje into elungileyo ngalo lonke ixesha.
Well, he didn't.	Ewe, akenzanga.
Someone there.	Umntu apho.
Maybe not with him, not yet.	Mhlawumbi hayi naye, hayi okwangoku.
It seems like a job.	Kubonakala ngathi ngumsebenzi.

It could be.	Kunokuba njalo.
Sorry but we have to go.	Uxolo kodwa kufuneka sihambe.
I thought better away from it.	Bendicinga ngcono kude kuyo.
But he didn't think, he just did.	Kodwa akazange acinge, wenza nje.
He took two things.	Wathatha izinto ezimbini.
If only a few days.	Ukuba kuphela iintsuku ezimbalwa.
But there is definitely no one there.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu apho.
That is not a walk in the park.	Oko akukho kuhamba epakini.

It goes that way.	Kuhamba ngolo hlobo.
Look really good.	Jonga kakuhle ngokwenene.

He spends too much on her.	Uchitha kakhulu kuye.
It will not be far away.	Akuyi kuba kude.
But once.	Kodwa kanye .
You had better buy a new one.	Kungcono uthenge nje entsha.

I wanted a name.	Bendifuna igama.
Better, much better.	Kungcono, ukuba ngcono kakhulu.
I'm starting to come again.	Ndiyaqala ukuza kwakhona.

But not that sorry.	Kodwa hayi ukuba uxolo.

And then, he seemed like that at first.	Kwaye ke, wayebonakala enjalo ekuqaleni.
Can you tell.	Ngaba uyakwazi ukuxelela.
Then he got another one.	Emva koko wafumana enye.
No, not his voice.	Hayi, hayi ilizwi lakhe.
That's right, that's it.	Kunjalo, yiloo nto.
That's how he felt now.	Waziva ngolo hlobo ke ngoku.
Shopping is personal.	Ukuthenga ngumntu.
You just have to be this.	Kufuneka ube nje oku.
And then you sit outside.	Kwaye ke uhlala ngaphandle.
That would be completely painful.	Oko bekuya kuba buhlungu ngokupheleleyo.
And you think a lot.	Kwaye ucinga kakhulu.
It seems obvious.	Kubonakala kucacile.
This never happened to me.	Ayizange yenzeke le nto kum.
I'm trying to tell you something.	Ndizama ukukuxelela into.
I didn't want anything else.	Ndandingafuni enye into.
After a while he fell asleep.	Emva kwexesha walala.
Probably, he said at last.	Mhlawumbi, wathi ekugqibeleni.
And you told me.	Kwaye undixelele.
Inside.	Ngaphakathi .
Then something wonderful happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka into entle.
Made in my home.	Yenziwe ekhaya lam.
I look to you all the time.	Ndijonge kuwe ngalo lonke ixesha.
And this must happen soon.	Kwaye oku kufuneka kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
You did nothing.	Awuzange wenze nto.
Just a mind.	Ingqondo nje.
He did it first.	Uyenzile kuqala.
So obviously.	Ngoko ngokucacileyo .
Now or never.	Ngoku okanye soze.
And we need to do it as soon as possible.	Kwaye kufuneka siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
Look here !.	Jonga apha!.
Well, it could be true.	Kulungile, inokuba yinyani.
No look.	Hayi jonga.
I heard about you.	Ndive ngawe.
Work alone.	Umsebenzi wedwa.
I just wanted a place.	Bendifuna nje indawo.
You read your work.	Ufunda umsebenzi wakho.
And do they live.	Kwaye ngaba bahlala.
Anything or anything.	Nantoni na nantoni na.
Inside, everyone is asleep.	Ngaphakathi, wonke umntu ulele.
I read better.	Ndifunde ngcono.
I stay in my room almost all the time.	Ndihlala egumbini lam phantse lonke ixesha.
Everyone wants it to happen.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba kwenzeke.
I think .	Ndiyacinga .
And it will be very good.	Kwaye kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
He’s not like that, though.	Akakho ngolo hlobo, nangona kunjalo.
Stop being hard on yourself.	Yeka ukuba nzima kuwe.
This, as we shall see, is not true.	Oku, njengoko siza kubona, akunjalo.
They both say, no.	Bathi bobabini, hayi.
I thought it might be.	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba .
He wanted to do things.	Wayefuna ukwenza izinto.
If you are good enough, you will make money.	Ukuba ulungile ngokwaneleyo, uya kuyenza imali.
I think about myself.	Ndicinga ngam.
My mother, of course, says no.	Umama, kunjalo, uthi hayi.
He did not think it was strange.	Akazange acinge ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
I told you, you have to tell me.	Ndikuxelele, kufuneka undixelele.
Not anyone.	Hayi nabani na.
In a better place.	Kwindawo engcono.
You will do the same.	Nawe uya kukwenza oku.
He did not want money.	Wayengafuni mali.
I never thought he would want to.	Zange ndicinge ukuba akafuni.
Then one knows what happens to money.	Emva koko umntu uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngemali.
Everything to play with then.	Yonke into yokudlala ngoko.
That's why you need to talk.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka uthethe.
He wishes it to be so.	Unqwenela ukuba kube njalo.
However, it is very difficult to do.	Nangona kunjalo, kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
That is everything and nothing.	Yiyo yonke into kwaye akukho nto.
And it's a big job.	Kwaye ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
And he never told her.	Kwaye akazange amxelele.
You can't imagine why.	Awukwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni.
I don't know about that.	Andikwazi ngaloo nto.
He didn't know why that, at first.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni oko, ekuqaleni.
So do not think that this is something new.	Ngoko musa ukucinga ukuba le yinto entsha.
It takes you without you.	Kuthatha wena ngaphandle kwakho.
I'm just coming here.	Ndiza apha nje .
I want you to do one thing here.	Ndifuna wenze into enye apha.
It is something everyone does.	Yinto eyenziwa ngumntu wonke.
There was no turning back or death.	Kwakungekho kubuya mva okanye ukufa.
I'm sure it will come to me.	Ndiqinisekile iya kuza kum.
He wanted to play music.	Wayefuna ukudlala umculo.
Then three years, nothing.	Emva koko iminyaka emithathu, akukho nto.
And this is something that is immediately apparent.	Kwaye le yinto ebonakala kwangoko.
We need to do it again.	Kufuneka siyenze kwakhona.
I never thought so.	khange ndicinge njalo.

He wants to be a man.	Ufuna ukuba yindoda.
You want him to know that you exist.	Ufuna ukuba azi ukuba ukhona.
People will wait.	Abantu baya kulinda.
You know how to do it.	Uyayazi indlela yokwenza.
No, we are not.	Hayi, asiyi.

Nothing small, that.	Akukho nto encinci, leyo.
So that would be a job.	Ngoko oko bekuya kuba ngumsebenzi.

I just love it too.	Nam ndiyayithanda nje.
I talk all the time.	Ndithetha ngalo lonke ixesha.
Everyone is looking at you.	Wonke umntu ujonge kuwe.
Then, before you know it, you're gone.	Emva koko, ngaphambi kokuba uyazi, uye wahamba.
He came in here.	Wangena apha.
Then he said.	Emva koko wathi .
You told him you were fine.	Umxelele ukuba uhambe kakuhle.
I'm just trying to be myself.	Ndizama nje ukuba ndim .
Not that he looked bad.	Hayi ukuba wayekhangeleka kakubi.

He thought he was doing better.	Wayecinga ukuba wenza ngcono.
It’s not like it’s a big deal.	Akunjalo ngathi yinto enkulu.
Yes it is my job.	Ewe ngumsebenzi wam.
I decided on him.	Ndagqiba ngaye.
It will be even more fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi ngakumbi.
Whenever you want.	Nanini ufuna.
Probably his mother.	Mhlawumbi umama wakhe.
No one will live long.	Akukho mntu uya kuhlala ixesha elide.
Well, it wasn't.	Ewe, kwakungekho.
She looks very high.	Ujonge phezulu kakhulu.

What happened is a very strange thing.	Into eyenzekayo yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
That is why it must be done.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka yenziwe.
yes it is.	ewe yiyo.
Mother came.	Wafika umama.
Again, it will be more difficult.	Kwakhona, kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He talked to him, he did.	Wathetha naye, wenza.
So why is he doing this.	Khona kutheni esenza lento.
Money, of course.	Imali, kunjalo.

He did his job.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
He asked me why.	Wandibuza ukuba kutheni.

He did not want his mother to be alone.	Akazange afune ukuba umama wakhe abe yedwa.
Or not at this time.	Okanye hayi ngeli xesha.
To someone else.	Komnye umntu.
This happened a long time ago, of course.	Oku kwenzeka kudala, kunjalo.
He has achieved great.	Uphumelele enkulu.
It only takes one.	Kuthatha enye kuphela.
You work hard for your money.	Usebenza nzima ngemali yakho.
One more thing, she is too tall to be beautiful.	Enye into, mde kakhulu ukuba abe mhle.
But anything else.	Kodwa nantoni na enye.
Don't try to sing.	Musa ukuzama ukucula.
I think you know we need to do this.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba kufuneka siyenze le nto.
I want to do things.	Ndifuna ukwenza izinto.
He just sits down.	Uhlala phantsi nje.
It seems to me that there are three.	Kubonakala kum ukuba kukho ezintathu.
And certainly not now.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngoku.
As we all need.	Njengoko kufuneka sonke.
Don't hold back like that.	Musa ukuzibamba ngolo hlobo.
Why is that.	Kutheni, kunjalo.
The food will be good.	Ukutya kuya kuba kuhle.
About you, and about us.	Malunga nawe, kwaye ngathi.
If it takes a long time, then it takes a long time.	Ukuba kuthatha ixesha elide, ngoko kuthatha ixesha elide.
So it is not that simple.	Ngoko akukho lula kangako.
So he can't make a place.	Ngoko akakwazi ukwenza indawo.
You must have thought better of it.	Umele ukuba wacinga ngcono ngayo.
It just means that.	Kuthetha oko kuphela.
I couldn't eat much this morning.	Khange ndikwazi ukutya kakhulu ngale ntsasa.
And not just a few.	Kwaye hayi nje ezimbalwa.
I know which one.	Ndiyazi ukuba yeyiphi.
And now it's back.	Kwaye ngoku kubuya.
I had to say that once.	Kwafuneka ndithethe oko kube kanye.
Not only is it impossible.	Hayi nje akunakwenzeka.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele ukuba.
Money is nothing.	Imali akukho nto.
I want to learn from you even now.	Ndifuna ukufunda kuwe nangoku.
Lunch at the park.	Isidlo sasemini epakini.
He makes it a little harder.	Uyenza nzima kancinci.
There seems to be no one at home.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho mntu ekhaya.
So, we need your help.	Ngoko, sifuna uncedo lwakho.
I will never do it again.	Andisayi kuphinda.
He will have to know by now.	Kuya kufuneka azi ngoku.
She loves it on the outside.	Uyayithanda ngaphandle.
I don't remember which one now.	Andikhumbuli ukuba yeyiphi ngoku.
No one needs to know what he was thinking.	Akukho mntu umele azi ukuba wayecinga ntoni.
But more importantly, his music.	Kodwa ngakumbi, umculo wakhe.
I'll start there.	Ndiza kuqala ukuya apho.
I fully know that you can do it.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo ukuba ungayenza.
We did not have a party.	Asizange senze itheko.
But one another.	Kodwa omnye komnye.
He did it in a very good way.	Uyenze ngendlela entle kakhulu.
I apologize for everything.	Ndicela uxolo ngayo yonke into.
Later, perhaps, later.	Kamva, mhlawumbi, kamva.
Or my children.	Okanye abantwana bam.
That comes to me.	Oko kuza kum.
But he knew it was possible.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Both my parents.	Abazali bam bobabini.
If so, she did not stay long.	Ukuba kunjalo, akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
You know what happened to me, by the way.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum, ngendlela.
There is not much to do in the area.	Akukho kakhulu ukwenza kwindawo.
Thus there is a problem.	Ngaloo ndlela kukho ingxaki.
I know a lot about it.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngayo.
And now, maybe, his wife.	Kwaye ngoku, mhlawumbi, umfazi wakhe.
He pulled out his phone.	Wakhupha umnxeba wakhe.
But he remains.	Kodwa uhlala.
I had to stay there.	Kwafuneka ndihlale apho.
He found a room.	Wafumana igumbi.
Just a little bit, but it is.	Kancinci nje, kodwa yinto.
Before you get here.	Ngaphambi kokuba ufike apha.
I'll be easy.	Ndiza lula.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Nokuba yintoni na, iya kuba.
What are you going to do.	Uza kwenza ntoni.
He thinks he is invisible.	Ucinga ukuba akabonakali.
I'm a little afraid it might hurt.	Ndiyoyika kancinci ukuba inokuba buhlungu.
There is truth there.	Kukho inyaniso apho.
He walks back.	Uhamba emva.
You want more.	Ufuna okuninzi.
We all have to be that way and be that way again.	Sonke kufuneka sibe njalo kwaye sibe kwakhona.
He knew he had to have it.	Wayesazi ukuba ufanele abe nayo.
You do not want us to move forward.	Awufuni ukuba siye phambili.
He got a lot out of it.	Wafumana okuninzi kuyo.
But yes, absolutely.	Kodwa ewe, ngokupheleleyo.
I think the picture is good.	Ndicinga ukuba umfanekiso ulungile.
But he said he had something to say to you.	Kodwa uthe kukho into afuna ukuyithetha kuwe.
He has lived here all his life.	Uhleli apha ubomi bakhe bonke.
Not always, but it happens.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa kwenzeka.
Or it will go thinking.	Okanye kuya kuhamba ukucinga.
But it has lasted a very long time.	Kodwa uye wahlala ixesha elide kakhulu.
Maybe he slept in his old place.	Mhlawumbi walala kwindawo yakhe endala.
A book, a mind.	Incwadi, ingqondo.
Please help again.	Nceda kwakhona.
That's all we have to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka siyenze.
I have to go with you.	Kufuneka ndihambe nawe.
You did the same.	Nawe wenze njalo.
I hope you don't.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe awufuni.
But anyway, anyway.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
Well, you already know a lot right there.	Ke, sele uyazi okuninzi kanye apho.
But maybe you think you know about him.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba uyazi ngaye.
The answer is no.	Impendulo kukuba, akunakwenzeka.
You are the job.	Nguwe umsebenzi.
Or something like that.	Okanye enye into enjalo.
And until then, there is no need.	Kwaye kude kube ngoko, akukho mfuneko.
For him there is nothing.	Kuye akukho nto.
Another would take my place.	Omnye wayeza kuthatha indawo yam.
I did not know how long it would last.	Ndandingazi ukuba iza kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
He will do it for him.	Uya kuyenza kuye.
You think so.	Ucinga ukuba kunjalo.
And he expects me to go with him.	Kwaye ulindele ukuba ndihambe naye.
Real see.	Ukubona ngokwenene.
And now he didn't know what to do.	Kwaye ngoku wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni na.
Again a little too much.	Kwakhona kancinci kakhulu.
I knew nothing about it.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo yonke loo nto.
I've always wanted to know about him.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukwazi ngaye.
I never thought it would be easy.	Khange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba lula.
I will stay there.	Ndiza kuhlala apho.
So he took a picture outside.	Ngoko wathatha umfanekiso ngaphandle.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ncam ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
So you like to be alone.	Ngoko uthanda ukuba wedwa.
And of course, now everyone has done it.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo, ngoku wonke umntu uyenzile.
Every three, obviously.	Njalo ezintathu, ngokucacileyo.
Soon you will have many friends.	Kungekudala uza kuba nabahlobo abaninzi.
Excuse me, what? 	Uxolo yintoni?
Your father is not like that.	Utata wakho akanjalo.
I love the truth.	Ndiyayithanda inyaniso.
John does not know why.	UYohane akazi ukuba kutheni.
But he wanted children.	Kodwa wayefuna abantwana.
I like it big.	Ndiyayithanda enkulu.
We have done this.	Senze ngolu hlobo ke.
Then who.	Khona ngubani .
You can see your location.	Uyakwazi ukubona indawo yakho.
Now you have succeeded.	Ngoku uphumelele.
It all goes together.	Konke kuhamba kunye.
That is why we need help.	Yiyo loo nto sifuna uncedo.
You look very much at it.	Ujonge kakhulu kuyo.
I've always wanted to know what that would be like.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kuya kuba njani oko.
He says there is something new in it.	Uthi kukho into entsha kuyo.
I actually went to it.	Nyani ndaya kuyo.
It's hard there.	Kunzima phaya.
Yes all yes.	Ewe konke ewe.
I do not want you to go to prison.	Andifuni ukuba uye entolongweni.
Or not if we know about it.	Okanye hayi ukuba siyazi ngayo.
And we never had an answer.	Kwaye asizange sibe nayo impendulo.
His wife was not at home.	Umfazi wakhe wayengekho ekhaya.
She is sure of him.	Uqinisekile ngaye.
I do not understand the way.	Andiqondi indlela.
I did it for him.	Ndenze ngaye.
I feel forgotten.	Ndiziva ndilibele.
And he is old now.	Kwaye mdala ngoku.
Certainly, he was not, not at all.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wayengekho, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
And his friends.	Kwaye nabahlobo bakhe.
As soon as possible! 	Ngokukhawuleza!
as soon as possible! 	ngokukhawuleza!
He wasn't visible enough about her.	Wayengabonakali ngokwaneleyo ngaye.
He is the one who will come to us.	Nguye oza kuthi.
Your place should also.	Indawo yakho kufuneka nayo.
I don't think anyone did that.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho mntu wenze njalo.
I spoke to him yesterday.	Ndithethe naye izolo.
We just want a little bit.	Sifuna nje kancinci.
I decided that.	Ndagqiba ekubeni.
In the end he did not come at all.	Ekugqibeleni akazange eze kwaphela.
I just want to do something else.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza enye into.
The doctor started working.	Ugqirha waqalisa ukusebenza.
Then one away.	Emva koko omnye kude.
It seemed to them that they were everywhere.	Kuye kwakubonakala ngathi bakho kuyo yonke indawo.
We all know.	Sonke siyazi.
He will be gone again soon.	Uza kuhamba kwakhona kungekudala.
He works here.	Usebenza apha .
The police, of course.	Amapolisa, kunjalo.
Now he sat down.	Ngoku wahlala phantsi.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kangako.
How do you know ?.	Uyazi njani?.
I did not want to think.	Ndandingafuni ukucinga.
He fell asleep, he thought.	Walala, wacinga.
He says yes anyway.	Uthi kunjalo kunjalo.
She is doing well at school.	Uhleli kakuhle esikolweni.
But lately he is happy again.	Kodwa mva nje uyavuya kwakhona.
Inside you want nothing.	Ngaphakathi awufuni nto.
All her parents went without me.	Bonke abazali bakhe baya ngaphandle kwam.
I just want to read this question.	Ndifuna nje ukufunda lo mbuzo.
You know the answer.	Uyayazi impendulo.
He stayed home all night.	Wahlala ekhaya ubusuku bonke.
Nothing.	Akukho nto .
Everyone is talking about it out here, of course.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo apha phandle, kunjalo.
This is very good for you.	Oku kuhle kakhulu kuwe.
There is no father at all.	Akakho utata tu.
I will need you to do some things.	Ndiza kufuna ukuba wenze ezinye izinto.
And what a great book.	Kwaye yeyiphi incwadi enkulu.
I will try this for sure.	Ndiza kuzama oku ngokuqinisekileyo.
I hope they will come again one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuza kwakhona ngenye imini.
Not before, not now, anytime.	Hayi ngaphambili, hayi ngoku, nanini na.
Just a little way.	Indlela encinci nje.
We will get as much as you want.	Siza kufumana kangangoko ufuna.
If you learn from it.	Ukuba ufunda kuyo.
For this, we will need to do two things.	Kule nto, kuya kufuneka senze izinto ezimbini.
No matter what you do.	Nokuba wenza ntoni na.
In the end, it will be better.	Ekugqibeleni, kuya kuba ngcono.
I can't say what it is.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba yintoni.
Thanks for any feedback.	Enkosi kuyo nayiphi na impendulo.
But it can certainly be.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo.
He thinks he is.	Ucinga ukuba nguye.
I don't want to do this tonight.	Andifuni kuyenza le nto ngokuhlwanje.
That is the danger.	Yiyo ke loo ngozi.
One thing or another.	Enye into okanye enye.
And everyone left.	Kwaye wonke umntu wemka.
You look so much like him, too.	Ufana naye kakhulu, nawe.
I will never go there again.	Soze ndiye apho kwakhona.
I can help children.	Ndiyakwazi ukunceda abantwana.
Maybe you did something about it the other day.	Mhlawumbi wenze into ngayo ngenye imini.
Everyone is as good as you.	Wonke umntu ulungile njengawe.
His success is better.	Ukuphumelela kwakhe kungcono.
Now and again.	Ngoku kwaye kwakhona .
I do not understand now.	Andiqondi ngoku.
We want my departure.	Sifuna ukuhamba kwam.
I always look.	Ndihlala ndijonge.
This will be our first job.	Oku kuya kuba ngumsebenzi wethu wokuqala.
One is waiting for his turn.	Omnye ulindele ithuba lakhe.
It is all or nothing.	Yinto yonke okanye akukho nto.
Now tell me something else.	Ngoku ndixelele enye into.
We need your help on this.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho kule.
Yes we know.	Ewe siyazi.
Not that, but if possible.	Ayisiyiyo loo nto, kodwa ukuba kunokwenzeka.
It's not that easy.	Akunjalo lula.
It would be nice to see more of that.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukubona ngakumbi oko.
He is the reason you are here.	Nguye isizathu sokuba ube lapha.
Look at everything.	Jonga kuyo yonke into.
I will be your friend.	Ndiza kuba ngumhlobo wakho.
To him, it could be.	Kuye, kunokuba njalo.
He wanted to sing.	Wayefuna ukucula.
He tried many things.	Wazama izinto ezininzi.
I don't care, myself.	Andikhathali, mna ngokwam.
This, however, is a huge undertaking.	Lo, nangona kunjalo, ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
But please sit down.	Kodwa ndicela uhlale phantsi.
Nothing happens to us.	Akukho nto eyenzekayo kuthi.
I did not want to leave his room.	Bendingafuni ukuphuma egumbini lakhe.
Everyone stays in the car.	Wonke umntu uhlala emotweni.
I always try to do better myself.	Ndihlala ndizama ukwenza ngcono mna.
You must be old.	Umele ukuba mdala.
We both want money.	Sobabini sifuna imali.
We have to go! ' 	Sifanele siye apho!'
This work should be fun.	Lo msebenzi kufuneka ube mnandi.
That is not our thing.	Asiyonto yethu leyo.
But, it should.	Kodwa, kufuneka.
Well, just trying.	Kulungile, ukuzama nje.
Let me see the car.	Makhe ndibone imoto.
We will be at your place soon.	Siza kuba kwindawo yakho ngokukhawuleza.
Look at your person.	Jonga umntu wakho.
But it would be good to have more time.	Kodwa bekuya kuba kuhle ukuba nexesha elingakumbi.
All day, all day.	Imini yonke, imini yonke.
And it's a little painful.	Kwaye kancinci buhlungu.
And my whole life.	Kwaye ubomi bam bonke.
He will stay with you.	Uza kuhlala nawe.
Almost play hard to find.	Phantse ukudlala nzima ukufumana .
Knowledge does all the work.	Ukwazi kwenza wonke umsebenzi.
I never talked to you about him.	Zange ndithethe nawe ngaye.
I know my way.	Ndiyayazi indlela yam.
He too thought that it was impossible to succeed.	Naye wayecinga ukuba akunakwenzeka ukuphumelela.
Maybe you will be able to get a job.	Mhlawumbi uya kukwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
I went to college.	Ndaya ekholejini.
He never read.	Zange afunde.
I'm trying to work on everything here.	Ndizama ukusebenza kuyo yonke into apha.
I thought it might be me.	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba ngam.
Everything else is right about that.	Yonke enye into ilungile kuloo nto.
A minor problem.	Ingxaki encinci.
Only no one was there.	Kuphela kwakungekho mntu.
Well, not at this time.	Ewe, akunjalo ngeli xesha.
I don't know about all this.	Andazi ngayo yonke le nto.
That happened later.	Oko kwenzeka kamva.
Certainly enough to last a lifetime, if possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo ukuhlala ubomi bakhe bonke, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I had to make dinner.	Kwafuneka ndenze isidlo sangokuhlwa.
He knew better, now.	Wayesazi ngcono, ngoku.
Really, really attentive.	Ngokwenene, ingqalelo ngokwenene.
I hope to do that one day too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiya kukwenza oko ngenye imini nam.
We did it for everyone.	Senze wonke umntu.
But maybe it's time.	Kodwa mhlawumbi lixesha.
This is not required.	Oku akufuneki.
It is time for him to make a decision.	Lixesha lokuba enze isigqibo.
That would be great for me.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle kum.
Finding a good job now is almost impossible.	Ukufumana umsebenzi olungileyo ngoku phantse akunakwenzeka.
Not after a long time.	Hayi emva kwexesha elide.
Or stay.	Okanye ukuhlala.
It certainly seems to us.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi.
No, just a little bit.	Hayi, kancinci nje.
But no, no.	Kodwa hayi, hayi.
But you have something.	Kodwa unayo into.
But it will not be easy.	Kodwa akuyi kuba lula.
But there is someone.	Kodwa kukho umntu.
What do you think?.	Ucinga ntoni?.
Before that.	Phambi kokuba njalo.
Something new.	Into entsha.
Is that it.	Ngaba leyo .
No one knows much about him.	Akukho mntu wazi kakhulu ngaye.
It almost never was.	Phantse ayizange yenziwe.
After everything is done.	Emva kokuba yonke into yenziwe.
Now everything is fine.	Ngoku yonke into ilungile.
Yes, but.	Ewe, kodwa .
Slowly at first, then quickly.	Kancinci ekuqaleni, emva koko ngokukhawuleza.
I'm glad to get help.	Ndiyavuya ukufumana uncedo.
Everyone should be.	Wonke umntu ufanele abe.
I'm scared and a little skeptical.	Ndiyoyika kwaye ndiyathandabuza kancinci.
I did not see anything.	Khange ndibone kwanto.
He had to stop thinking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukucinga.
Help other people.	Nceda abanye abantu.
That is something new for me.	Yinto entsha kum leyo.
Completely and completely.	Ngokupheleleyo kwaye ngokupheleleyo.
You can have friends there.	Unokuba nabahlobo apho.
This is an old thing.	Yinto endala le.
He was gone for a long time.	Wayengekho ixesha elide.
She has run after him.	Uye wabaleka emva kwakhe.
But even that won't last long.	Kodwa nangona oko akuyi kuba ixesha elide.
He is not that far away.	Akakho kude kangako.
Yes, and children.	Ewe, nabantwana.
And he can speak well.	Kwaye uyakwazi ukuthetha kakuhle.
She is trying to tell you about it.	Uzama ukuxelela ngoko.
Something that is not about us.	Into engekho ngathi.
Well, that is much better.	Ewe, oko kungcono kakhulu.
There is no one here for this.	Akukho mntu apha kule nto.
And we never made it easy for him.	Kwaye asizange senze kube lula kuye.
This means that there is another.	Oku kuthetha ukuba kukho enye.
He looked almost.	Wajonga phantse .
Stop talking about it.	Yeka ukuthetha ngayo.
We will continue with it, later.	Siza kuqhubeka nayo, kamva.
Thank you so much, for everything.	Enkosi kakhulu, ngayo yonke into.
Not any cat.	Hayi nayiphi na ikati.
You will not have time to do anything.	Awuyi kuba nexesha lokwenza nantoni na.
She will have to learn more at home.	Kuya kufuneka afunde ngakumbi ekhaya.
He looks like us.	Ukhangeleka ngathi .
No one built.	Akukho mntu wakha .
Nobody wants to play with me.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukudlala nam.
I thought so.	Ndandicinga ukuba kakhulu.
Or anything about him.	Okanye nantoni na ngaye.
You better talk to her.	Kungcono uthethe naye.
He has gone.	Uye waya .
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle .
Another came out.	Waphuma omnye.
And we must be.	Kwaye kufuneka sibe njalo.
Almost always.	Phantse njalo.
Dad did not go.	UTata akazange aye.
A night or two ahead.	Ubusuku okanye ezimbini ngaphambili.
You are the problem.	Nguwe ingxaki.
You love your car.	Uyayithanda imoto yakho.
Whoever it is, he's almost in.	Nokuba ngubani na, uphantse ukuba angene.
I'm not in that.	Andikho kuloo nto.
One story, another story.	Elinye ibali, elinye ibali.
He opened the door and went in.	Wavula ucango, wangena.
Maybe he's not here.	Mhlawumbi akakho apha.
However, today.	Nangona kunjalo, namhlanje.
I want to learn from someone else.	Ndifuna ukufunda komnye umntu.
Don't be a big person.	Musa ukuba ngumntu omkhulu.
At first, you do not want to leave.	Ekuqaleni, awufuni ukuhamba.
Glad you love it.	Uyavuya uyayithanda.
Every day something new happens.	Yonke imihla kwenzeka into entsha.
And there is a time.	Kwaye kukho ixesha.
But he did not stop speaking.	Kodwa akazange ayeke ukuthetha.
He always told me.	Undixelele njalo.
Is there any work here.	Ngaba kukho umsebenzi apha.
He's here, now, by my side.	Ulapha, ngoku, ecaleni kwam.
Last night we went to a real lodge restaurant.	Phezolo siye kwindawo yokutyela yokuhlala ngokwenene.
Finding a new place to live can be a challenge.	Ukufumana indawo entsha yokuhlala kunokuba nzima.
I didn't want to do that.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
And you did so well.	Kwaye wenze kakuhle kangakanani.
It's even harder now.	Kunzima ngakumbi ngoku.
We are all like that.	Sonke kunjalo.
But you are only one person.	Kodwa ungumntu omnye kuphela.
He looked at her, he looked at her.	Wajonga kuye, wajonga kuye.
If he was afraid, he would not agree.	Ukuba wayesoyika, akazange avume.
If something happened to you.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekileyo kuwe.
Just one small problem.	Ingxaki enye nje encinci.
It should have been far enough.	Bekufanele ukuba kude ngokwaneleyo.
That's probably right.	Kunjalo mhlawumbi.
I did not want to be alone.	Ndandingafuni ukuba ndedwa.
Yes I am.	Ewe, ndim.
So you certainly do not want too much.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo awufuni kakhulu.
He could not hold back.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba izinto.
He's not going to me.	Akayi kum.
Someone else will have to do it.	Omnye umntu kuya kufuneka ayenze.
Or one, or the other.	Okanye enye, okanye enye.
But it is coming too late.	Kodwa iza emva kwexesha kakhulu.
He loves money but not work.	Uthanda imali kodwa hayi umsebenzi.
He should not have gotten into this.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba angene kule nto.
This is bound to happen, and it is possible that it will happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo, kwaye kunokwenzeka ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
You can't think of anything else.	Awukwazi ukucinga ngenye into.
He came with it.	Uye weza nayo.
We had better leave immediately.	Kungcono sihambe kwangoko.
He went to the side.	Uye ecaleni.
Whatever it is, it's time.	Nokuba yintoni na, lixesha.
Not now, though.	Hayi ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
It's just one old thing, one old.	Yinto nje endala enye, endala enye.
It will never happen.	Soze yenzeke .
You will have to tell.	Kuya kufuneka uxelele.
If you haven't, you should.	Ukuba awuzange wenze, ufanele.
I sometimes do.	Ndikhe ndiyenze .
He told me he had retired from that.	Wandixelela ukuba wathatha umhlala-phantsi kuloo nto.
But, above all, it is very difficult.	Kodwa, ngaphezu kwakho konke, kunzima kakhulu.
So he must have asked.	Ngoko umele ukuba wabuza.
But he did not know what would happen next.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
You can do all that.	Ungayenza yonke loo nto.
But it is very true.	Kodwa yinyani kakhulu.
Trying to find the truth.	Ukuzama ukufumana inyaniso.
I had to wait for his death.	Kwafuneka ndilinde ukufa kwakhe.
One of us will be here all night.	Omnye wethu uza kuba apha ubusuku bonke.
I'm sure I have no money.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba andinayo imali.
That means enough.	Oko kuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
Or without me.	Okanye ngaphandle kwam.
Then he ate.	Emva koko watya.
I try to wait.	Ndizama ukulinda.
I tried to say it.	Ndazama ukuyithetha.
But you should.	Kodwa ufanele ukuba.
I couldn't help but sit still.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ndihlale.
Not really people, though.	Hayi ngokwenene abantu, nangona.
I'm sure you did the same thing.	Ndiqinisekile wenze into enye.
Sorry to say so.	Uxolo ukuthetha.
There is plenty of food.	Kukho ukutya okuninzi.
All the time and only in my car.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kwaye kuphela emotweni yam.
Perhaps this has happened to you.	Mhlawumbi oku kuye kwenzeka kuwe.
Hats and all that.	Umnqwazi kunye nayo yonke loo nto.
Mom loves her book.	Umama uyayithanda incwadi yakhe.
But everyone and everything will go faster.	Kodwa wonke umntu kunye nayo yonke into iya kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe he should have it.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka abe nayo.
To me this is very difficult.	Kum oku kunzima kakhulu.
Do not do this.	Musa ukwenza ngolu hlobo.
But he is also afraid.	Kodwa naye uyoyika.
Soon you will be better.	Kungekudala uya kuba ngcono.
But we will certainly do it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo siza kwenza njalo.
You probably know many.	Mhlawumbi wazi abaninzi.
But not so now though.	Kodwa akunjalo ngoku nangona kunjalo.
There is no coming back now.	Akukho kubuya ngoku.

It's very hard to talk about today.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngayo namhlanje.
And he was really angry.	Kwaye waba nomsindo ngokwenene.
I myself did not.	Mna ngokwam andizange.
Why, it's clear.	Kutheni, kucacile.
I like it!!!.	Ndiyayithanda!!!.
I don't want to be without her.	Andifuni kuba ngaphandle kwakhe.
Everyone is determined.	Wonke umntu uzimisele.
You may have done that.	Usenokuba uyenzile loo nto.
No one will find death here.	Akukho mntu uza kufumana ukufa apha.
No one knows more than anyone else.	Akukho mntu wazi ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
But just too good.	Kodwa nje kakuhle kakhulu.
How strange! 	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo!
Tell me how.	Ndixelele ukuba njani.
Here you can not help but think.	Apha awukwazi ukuzibamba ukucinga.

Not so much.	Akunjalo kakhulu.
Please speak as slowly as possible.	Nceda uthethe kancinci kangangoko.

And he said, All right.	Wathi ke, kulungile.
There was nothing that he did to cause it.	Akukho nto ayenzileyo ukuze abe nomsindo.
He was coming from far away.	Wayeza kude.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.

I'm doing better.	Ndiyenza ngcono.
Not with us in it.	Hayi kunye nathi kuyo.
It's hard to see now.	Kunzima ukubona ngoku.
She does well at work.	Usebenza kakuhle emsebenzini.
And it is completely impossible.	Kwaye akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
Our job.	Umsebenzi wethu.
But not together, no.	Kodwa hayi kunye, hayi.
So, that’s always hard for me.	Ngoko, oko kuhlala kunzima kum.
We will talk more.	Siza kuthetha kakhulu.
I want you to know this.	Ndifuna uyazi le nto.
I thought this way.	Ndacinga ngale ndlela.
But how I do not know.	Kodwa njani andazi.
Look in here.	Jonga apha ngaphakathi.
Please say something.	Ndicela uthethe into.
So he decided to become one.	Ngoko wagqiba ekubeni abe nguye.
I know your car.	Ndiyayazi imoto yakho.
You know something weird, though.	Uyazi into engaqhelekanga, nangona kunjalo.
He must have slept all day.	Umele ukuba walala imini yonke.
Look inside the book.	Jonga ngaphakathi kule ncwadi.
Even if he did not have to.	Nokuba bekungafanelanga ukuba abe njalo.
Far, far out.	Kude, kude ngaphandle.
Maybe my dad.	Mhlawumbi utata wam.
Just like he lived here, really.	Kanye njengokuba wayehlala apha, ngokwenene.
He thought so.	Wacinga ngaloo ndlela ke.
And finally he has entered.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni uye wangena.
What are you looking for this week ?.	Ujonge ntoni kule veki?.
But not so with you.	Kodwa akuyi kuba njalo kuwe.
I had to learn to do that better.	Kwafuneka ndifunde ukwenza oko ngcono.
They will want more from him going forward.	Baya kufuna ngakumbi kuye ukuya phambili.
There are times there and that alone will do.	Kukho amaxesha apho kwaye oko kuphela kuya kwenza.
Someone refused to play with him.	Omnye umntu akazange avume ukudlala naye.
This person is like that.	Lo mntu unjalo.
Then it should be easy and quick.	Emva koko kufuneka kube lula ngokukhawuleza.
It happens this way.	Kwenzeka ngale ndlela.
One that does so quickly.	Omnye owenza ngokukhawuleza.
I did nothing.	Zange ndenze nto.
I want to get out of bed.	Ndifuna ukuphuma ebhedini.
You want a new one.	Ufuna entsha.
But nothing to me.	Kodwa akukho nto kum.
I know, it's hard.	Ndiyazi, kunzima.
He lay down right in front of her.	Walala phantsi kanye phambi kwakhe.
You can be in two places at the same time.	Unokuba kwindawo ezimbini ngexesha elinye.
There is a reason after that.	Kukho isizathu emva koko.
So, if you know.	Ngoko ke, ukuba uyazi.
Absolutely high.	Ngokupheleleyo phezulu.
He opened the door and looked outside.	Wavula ucango wajonga phandle.
He actually left, he told me.	Ngenene uye wahamba, wandixelela.
You know, help me, please.	Uyazi, ndincede, nceda.
I apologize for the inconvenience.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke le meko.
I like it too, and it is very good.	Ndiyayithanda nam, kwaye ilungile kakhulu.
And not immediately.	Kwaye hayi kwangoko.
He took flowers.	Wathatha iintyatyambo.
I don't know about you.	Andazi ngawe.
If you are interested in him, fine.	Ukuba unomdla kuye, kulungile.
Success was not just that.	Ukuphumelela kwakungekho nje.
As you can imagine, it will be so.	Njengoko ucinga, uya kuba njalo.
Not that we know, of course.	Hayi ukuba siyazi, kunjalo.
I was thinking about something though.	Bendicinga ngento kodwa.
Well, maybe not now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi ngoku.
I want a place here.	Ndifuna indawo apha.
Another answer.	Enye impendulo.
I thought it would be good for him.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kuye.
But today.	Kodwa namhlanje .
Not tomorrow.	Hayi kusasa.
That seems too old now.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kudala kakhulu ngoku.
He has never spoken to me before.	Akazange athethe nam ngaphambili.
I also do not want you to leave.	Nam andifuni ukuba uhambe.
I don't want to do anything else.	Andifuni kwenza enye into.
Once it's done, it's done.	Xa sele yenziwe, yenziwe.
I know a little bit for sure.	Ndiyazi kancinci ngokuqinisekileyo.
Well, maybe this is me.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi ndim lo.
He looked away from me, hard.	Wajonga kude kum, kunzima.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
He did not want to have any friends.	Wayengafuni ukuba abe nabahlobo.
Immediately, please.	Kwangoko, nceda.
However, this is not the case for sure.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
He doesn't have to leave.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ahambe.
But you eat less.	Kodwa utya kancinci.
I will definitely try this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiza kuzama le.
Not just all of them.	Hayi nje bonke.
He wants to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba abe yedwa.
No one ever suggested otherwise.	Akukho mntu wakha wacebisa ngenye indlela.
He didn't want to say it now, though.	Wayengafuni ukuyithetha ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
That means nothing.	Oko kuthetha ukuba akukho nto.
One and the same.	Enye kunye efanayo.
It makes it easier for me.	Kwenza kube lula kum.
So he did nothing.	Ngoko akenzanga nto.
He is passionate and hardworking.	Unomdla kwaye usebenza nzima.
And he will find his way.	Kwaye uya kufumana indlela yakhe.
No one spoke to me about him.	Akukho mntu uthethe nam ngaye.
One down to that.	Enye phantsi kuloo nto.
I'd better see him before.	Kungcono ndimbone ngaphambili.
Whatever he wants.	Nantoni na ayifunayo.
But he talked to me about it.	Kodwa wathetha nam ngayo.
You have to go to that.	Kufuneka uye kuloo nto.
I think he will soon come to us.	Ndicinga ukuba kungekudala uza kuza kuthi.
In this case, we have certainly made a mistake.	Kule meko, ngokuqinisekileyo senze impazamo.
You really want this.	Ufuna ngokwenene oku.
You should be ready to move on.	Ufanele ukuba ulungile ukuya phambili.
Sorry, no.	Uxolo, hayi.
My entire debt.	Ityala lam ngokupheleleyo.
I will do better.	Ndiza kwenza ngcono.
So, obviously, he was already drinking.	Ngoko, ngokucacileyo, wayesele utywala.
It should then be okay for him to leave.	Kumele ukuba ngoko kulungile ukuba ahambe.
I have to look at performance.	Kufuneka ndijonge ukusebenza.
You’ll get there, really, and it will be great.	Uya kufika apho, ngokwenene, kwaye kuya kuba kuhle.
I have to do a few things very well.	Kufuneka ndenze izinto ezimbalwa kakuhle kakhulu.
Please know.	Nceda ukuba uyazi.
I'm not really going there.	Andiyi apho nyani.
That's very good.	Oko kulungile kakhulu.
Not at home, not at home, no.	Hayi ekhaya, hayi ekhaya, hayi.
Otherwise, it will not happen.	Ngaphandle koko, akuyi kwenzeka.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho enye into ekufuneka uyenzile.
That should not be done.	Akufunekanga yenziwe loo nto.
But other than that, he'll go with it.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko, uya kuhamba nayo.
And now everything is fine again.	Kwaye ngoku yonke into ilungile kwakhona.
Do not take it inside.	Musa ukuthatha ngaphakathi.
And since, he asked.	Kwaye ekubeni, wabuza.
But you have to be here.	Kodwa kufuneka ube lapha.
John told her this.	UYohane wamxelela oku.
Just look here.	Ndijonge nje apha.
I just want my money, thank you.	Ndifuna nje imali yam, enkosi.
And if you are willing to work my way up.	Kwaye ukuba uzimisele ukusebenza ngendlela yam.
He does not have to travel alone.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ahambe yedwa.
It wasn't him, of course.	Yayingenguye, kunjalo.
He must have told her.	Umele ukuba wamxelela.
And this is good.	Kwaye oku kuhle.
I would like to stay.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala.
That would continue.	Oko bekuya kuqhubeka.
I think it will happen, but it will take time.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka, kodwa kuya kuthatha ixesha.
Or maybe they will.	Okanye mhlawumbi baya kwenza njalo.
I never did this myself.	Andizange ndiyenze le nto mna.
He just wants to be with her.	Ufuna nje ukuba naye.
All of that is very demanding.	Konke oko kufuna kakhulu.
You're doing better now.	Wenza ngcono ngoku.
Or, with that, bad.	Okanye, ngaloo nto, embi.
I'm sorry to tell you that.	Ndiyaxolisa ukukuxelela lonto.
Just a few days, little by little.	Iintsuku nje ezimbalwa, kancinci kancinci.
But thank you for all your help.	Kodwa enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
Maybe it would be easier.	Mhlawumbi inokuba lula.
Her mother at home.	Umama wakhe ekhaya.
He wants to do it right away.	Ufuna ukuyenza ngoko nangoko.
I'm happy about that.	Ndiyavuya koko.
I don't know what exactly happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kanye kanye.
He pretends to think about it.	Wenza ngathi ucinga ngayo.
Yeah, fast that.	Ewe, ngokukhawuleza oko.
He picked up the phone.	Wathatha ifowuni.
However, one expects this to be very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, umntu ulindele ukuba oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
He really has done that.	Ngokwenene uye wakwenza oko.
But buying can be difficult.	Kodwa ukuthenga kunokuba nzima.
I want to have a party.	Ndifuna ukwenza itheko.
It was as if he were not really there.	Ngathi wayengekho nyani.
However, that is not really the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akunjalo ngokwenene.
And certainly not about you.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngawe.
They did not go far to school.	Abazange baye kude esikolweni.
I think you know that, too.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto, naye.
He went anyway.	Wahamba kunjalo.
One question please.	Umbuzo omnye nceda.
That's, you know, the problem.	Nantso, uyazi, ingxaki.
I could not contain myself.	Andikwazanga ukuzibamba.
He will stay for two days.	Uya kuhlala iintsuku ezimbini.
So we know how long it will take.	Siyazi ke ukuba siza kuyenza ixesha elingakanani.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba abe njalo.
You will not be here long.	Awuyi kuba apha ixesha elide.
You can't, of course.	Awukwazi, kunjalo.
What is wrong?.	Yintoni engalunganga?.
I myself do not have it.	Mna ngokwam andinayo.
He finished speaking.	Wagqiba wathetha.
All this.	Yonke le nto .
I will go faster on this.	Ndiza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza kule nto.
Finally, the lamp.	Ekugqibeleni, isibane.
We will do it again.	Siza kuyenza kwakhona.
Maybe we won't.	Mhlawumbi asiyi.
No one is like that.	Akukho mntu kunjalo.
Everyone was talking about it.	Wonke umntu wayethetha ngayo.
Here's to learning what happened.	Apha ukufunda ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
All of this speaks volumes.	Yonke le nto uthetha ngokukhawuleza.
I thought of many things.	Ndacinga izinto ezininzi.
Back there, too.	Emva phaya, kwakhona.
You will be down.	Uzakuba phantsi.
Except for now.	Ngaphandle nje ngoku.
I don’t want to do too much with this.	Andifuni ukwenza kakhulu ngale nto.
It happened this morning.	Kwenzeke ngale ntsasa.
To make it better.	Ukwenza kube ngcono.
I don't need to talk about it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe ngayo.
But we will try.	Kodwa siza kuzama.
Just buy a hat.	Ukuthenga nje umnqwazi.
That happened to us last week.	Oko kwenzeke kuthi kwiveki ephelileyo.
no! 	hayi!
He did a lot to keep it going.	Wenza kakhulu ukuba ahambe kakuhle.
I don't want anything of mine.	Andifuni nto yam.
He wanted me to talk to him.	Wayefuna ndithethe naye.
Before that, three things happened.	Ngaphambi koko, kwenzeka izinto ezintathu.
I did not see anyone.	khange ndibone mntu.
It will last a long time, however.	Kuya kuhlala ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
It must be too far away.	Kumele ukuba kude kakhulu.
You eat less but not more.	Utya kancinci kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Your mother is looking after the house.	Umama wakho ujonge indlu.
He just sat and stared.	Wahlala nje wajonga.
I hope for all of us.	Ndiyathemba kuthi sonke.
Better than you think you are.	Ungcono kunokuba ucinga ukuba unjalo.
Yeah, a lot of that.	Ewe, kakhulu ngaloo nto.
You want two things.	Ufuna izinto ezimbini.
Thank you everyone for being here.	Enkosi wonke umntu ngokuba lapha.
As I just want more time with me.	Njengoko ndifuna nje ixesha elingakumbi kunye nam.
You know what that will mean.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni oko.
I have to be a man.	Kufuneka ndibe yindoda.
But that is not all.	Kodwa ayinguye kwaphela lowo.
Nothing will do that.	Akukho nto iya kuyenza loo nto.
That's all you have to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile.
The truth was he did not know.	Inyaniso wayengazi.
This accident is real.	Le ngozi yinyani.
He came down to me and walked away.	Uye wehla kum wahamba.
What you don't go for, of course.	Oko awuyi, kunjalo.
So, of course, he did not.	Ngoko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange.
He fell asleep all that time.	Walala yonke loo nto.
The thing is, it's okay.	Into yile, kulungile.
I'm sure we'll be back.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba siza kubuya.
No harm will come to him.	Akukho ngozi iya kuza kuye.
And he did not want to stay.	Kwaye akazange afune ukuhlala.
And yes, that's very good.	Kwaye ewe, oko kuhle kakhulu.
If you have it, you almost certainly know.	Ukuba unayo, phantse ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi.
But no big deal.	Kodwa akukho ngxaki enkulu.
He would go on.	Wayeza kuqhubeka.
A new way, tonight.	Indlela entsha, ngokuhlwanje.
Yes, all of us.	Ewe, sonke.
Your mother will stay with you, all the time.	Umama wakho uya kuhlala nawe, ngalo lonke ixesha.
Not many things.	Hayi izinto ezininzi.
Please go.	Ndicela uhambe.
Although, it probably isn’t.	Nangona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I thought he was sure he would succeed.	Bendicinga ukuba uqinisekile ukuba uza kuphumelela.
It could just be you.	Unokuba nguwe nje.
I think you will be able to do that.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kukwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
But it's okay to be honest, of course.	Kodwa kulungile ukuthetha inyani, kunjalo.
I better not know.	Kungcono andazi.
You will be ready to go.	Uya kuba ukulungele ukuhamba.
But if you want to talk.	Kodwa ukuba ufuna ukuthetha.
Just being there.	Ukuba khona nje.
The bedroom, he thought.	Igumbi lokulala, wacinga.
Everything goes smoothly.	Konke kuhamba lula.
You can do it here.	Ungayenza apha.
Like me and you.	Njengam nawe.
But just in the beginning.	Kodwa nje ekuqaleni.
So, the question.	Ngoko ke, umbuzo.
He told me so much.	Undixelele kakhulu.
Yes, and then some.	Ewe, kwaye emva koko abanye.
This is my job, better or worse.	Lo ngumsebenzi wam, ngcono okanye kakubi.
Everything except me.	Yonke into ngaphandle kwam.
I wish to meet him.	Ndinqwenela ukudibana naye.
And without further ado.	Kwaye ngaphandle ngakumbi.
This did not happen to us.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke kuthi.
I thought it was okay.	Ndandicinga ukuba kulungile.
Then where do you live.	Khona uhlala phi .
Let me read this.	Makhe ndifunde oku.
Not for a long time, really.	Hayi ixesha elide, ngokwenene.
Impossible, of course.	Akunakwenzeka, kunjalo.
But everyone says he did.	Kodwa wonke umntu uthi wenze.
Everyone knows something.	Wonke umntu uyazi into.
There is no future for this.	Akukho kamva kule nto.
They will be difficult.	Baya kuba nzima.
My job can be very difficult.	Umsebenzi wam unokuba nzima kakhulu.
It's all such a thing.	Yinto yonke into enjalo.
Give me more time and try again.	Ndinike ixesha elingakumbi ndazama kwakhona.
I don't have that way.	Andinayo loo ndlela.
I need to know if you are a good person.	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukuba ungumntu olungileyo na.
He started walking fast.	Waqalisa ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Help me one day.	Ndincede ngenye imini.
It was visible now.	Kwakubonakala ngoku.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kuya kufuneka ube nje.
And it will be really fun.	Kwaye kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
She had to tell him now.	Kwafuneka amxelele ngoku.
Or even sit in the car.	Okanye uze uhlale emotweni.
So someone saw it.	Ngoko umntu wabona.
That's him.	Nguye ke lowo.
But that would be a good thing.	Kodwa oko kunokuba yinto entle.
There he was.	Apho waba khona .
I thought about it, though.	Ndacinga ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
In the end this really is not about you.	Ekugqibeleni oku ngokwenene akukho malunga nawe.
It will have to be in the afternoon though.	Kuza kufuneka kube emva kwemini kodwa.
Not because you want to succeed.	Hayi kuba ufuna ukuphumelela.
Look at the big thing.	Jonga into enkulu.
He hoped he would stay that way.	Wayenethemba lokuba uya kuhlala enjalo.
Tomorrow could be you.	Ngomso inokuba nguwe.
Nobody ever talked to me about it.	Akukho mntu ukhe wathetha nam ngayo.
Then go sit down again.	Uze uye kuhlala kwakhona.
And that was done.	Yenziwe ke loo nto.
If you are lucky, you are fine.	Ukuba unethamsanqa, ulungile.
You like this place.	Uyayithanda le ndawo.
There was nothing before we built a residence.	Kwakungekho nto ngaphambi kokuba sakhe indawo yokuhlala.
My mother went out and came in.	Uye waphuma umama wangena.
He will do that anyway.	Uza kuyenza loo nto nangona kunjalo.
However, that will not happen anytime soon.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akuyi kwenzeka kungekudala.
I can't imagine him not.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba akakho.
Nobody said a word, all right.	Akukho mntu uthethe ilizwi, kulungile.
I just arrived today.	Ndifike nje namhlanje.
He never talked to us about it.	Zange athethe nathi ngayo.
He felt like leaving.	Waziva efuna ukuhamba.
He decided to try the number.	Wagqiba kwelokuba azame inombolo.
Death happens immediately.	Ukufa kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
He'll be anytime now.	Uzakuba nanini na ngoku.
He kept doing it all the time.	Waqhubeka ekwenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
Looks like I made a mistake.	Kubonakala ngathi ndenze impazamo.
One day he did.	Ngenye imini wenza.
But he left.	Kodwa wemka .
We will need your help.	Siza kufuna uncedo lwakho.
He has done this now.	Uyenzile lento ngoku.
So this will only be one thing.	Ngoko oku kuya kuba yinto enye kuphela.
But we all know he won't do it.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuba akayi kuyenza.
You did not stay there long.	Awuzange uhlale ixesha elide apho.
Not just me, too.	Hayi mna kuphela, naye.
This time is far away.	Ngeli xesha kude.
This can be difficult at first.	Oku kunokuba nzima ekuqaleni.
Or you can do it today.	Okanye ungayenza namhlanje.
But he was also thinking.	Kodwa naye wayecinga.
Maybe you did something really wrong.	Mhlawumbi wenze into engalunganga ngokwenene.
Fresh coffee is made.	Ikofu entsha yenziwe.
But it can be very fun.	Kodwa inokuba mnandi kakhulu.
He admitted everything anyway.	Wavuma yonke into kunjalo.
Probably himself.	Mhlawumbi naye ngokwakhe.
But not in the office.	Kodwa hayi eofisini.
The place is fine, too.	Indawo ilungile, nayo.
And anything else will be.	Kwaye nantoni na enye iya kuba .
I did not want you to come.	Bendingafuni ukuba uze.
Then in the car.	Emva koko emotweni.
I did it very well this morning.	Ndiyenze ngendlela kakhulu ngale ntsasa.
I mean really.	Ndithetha ukuba ngenene.
Maybe not then, but certainly after.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngoko, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo emva.
He decided to have her.	Wagqiba ekubeni abe naye.
It’s not really fun, you know.	Akukho mnandi ngokwenene, uyazi.
I know right away what it is.	Ndiyazi ngoko nangoko ukuba yintoni na.
One, and one and the same.	Enye, kunye kunye.
It's a completely strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ngokupheleleyo.
There are many inside.	Kukho ezininzi ngaphakathi.
This has been a good thing.	Oku kube yinto entle.
He thought he would be back now.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kubuya ngoku.
I don't know if you know that or not.	Andazi noba uyayazi lonto okanye awuyazi.
He admitted that he did not.	Wavuma ukuba akazange.
We should have gone today.	Bekufanele sihambe namhlanje.
No one knew what was going on.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
He came here last night.	Weza apha phezolo.
I'm glad you're here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba ulapha.
John, suddenly.	UJohn, ngokukhawuleza.
Everything he does in his own time.	Yonke into uyenza ngexesha lakhe.
And maybe some.	Kwaye mhlawumbi abanye.
Really nice though.	Kuhle ngenene nangona.
It is better to think so.	Kungcono ukucinga ukuba kunjalo.
Nobody does that.	Akukho mntu wenza ngolo hlobo.
He never spoke to me again.	Zange aphinde athethe nam.
We all know he is good enough to do it.	Sonke siyazi ukuba ulungile ngokwaneleyo ukuba angayenza.
You better sit next to me.	Kungcono uhlale ecaleni kwam.
He sat down in a strange way.	Wahlala phantsi ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
He doesn't want to do that.	Akafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenze oko.
And maybe do some other things.	Kwaye mhlawumbi wenze ezinye izinto.
I'm not sure what time it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ngubani ixesha.
If you do it so far.	Ukuba uyenza kude kangaka.
He did what he wanted to do.	Wenza into ayifunayo.
Not well, that's fine.	Hayi kakuhle, kulungile.
And it all seemed fine.	Kwaye konke kwakubonakala kulungile.
Also outside.	Kwakhona ngaphandle.
He told her no.	Wamxelela ukuba hayi .
Probably because no one has ever given me anything.	Mhlawumbi kuba akukho mntu wakha wandinika nantoni na.
I want it to be true, though.	Ndifuna ukuba yinyani, nangona kunjalo.
It is our job to do that.	Ngumsebenzi wethu ukwenjenjalo.
In college, obviously not.	Ekholejini, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
Maybe they will do that.	Mhlawumbi baya kukwenza oko.
Another little thing.	Enye into encinci.
That will make everything difficult.	Oko kuya kuyenza nzima yonke into.
I love your talk today.	Ndiyayithanda intetho yakho namhlanje.
If you have too much too.	Ukuba unayo kakhulu nawe.
Of course, certainly not.	Ngokwenene, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
We will go everywhere together.	Siza kuya kuyo yonke indawo kunye.
This time, however, it seems possible.	Ngeli xesha, nangona kunjalo, kubonakala ngathi kunokwenzeka.
I wanted to be better.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngcono.
Good or bad.	Into entle okanye embi kakhulu.
Improvement.	Ukwenza ngcono.
It will succeed.	Iya kuphumelela.
All in all, if you like.	Konke, ukuba uyathanda.
He said yes, in the end.	Wathi ewe, ekugqibeleni.
And that, too, is fine.	Kwaye oko, kwakhona, kulungile.
We will not be in it.	Asiyi kuba kuyo.
Give me more.	Ndinike ngakumbi.
Obviously, he knows nothing about this.	Ngokucacileyo, akazi nto ngale nto.
Definitely my book.	Ngokuqinisekileyo incwadi yam.
But it is very possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
But for now, he's much better off with me, too.	Kodwa okwangoku, ungcono kakhulu ukuba abe nam, naye.
Not everyone, of course.	Ayinguye wonke umntu, kunjalo.
It is difficult to find a job at this time.	Kunzima ukufumana umsebenzi ngeli xesha.
Is that it.	Ngaba oko .
It is very difficult there.	Kunzima kakhulu apho.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngomso.
It just seems that way.	Kubonakala ngaloo ndlela kuphela.
Tomorrow should be fun.	Ngomso kufuneka kube mnandi.
I mean here, of course, that's my job.	Ndithetha apha, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngumsebenzi wam lowo.
If you go, everyone will want to know why.	Ukuba uhamba, wonke umntu uya kufuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
But he must not go alone.	Kodwa akufuneki ahambe yedwa.
His gun lay on the ground.	Umpu wakhe walala phantsi.
But no one outside knows about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ngaphandle uyazi ngayo.
So she knew that he loved her.	Ngoko wayesazi ukuba uyamthanda.
To be with you.	Ukuba nawe.
It just seemed like he was interested in her.	Kwakubonakala nje ukuba unomdla kuye.
Some will succeed and some will succeed.	Abanye baya kuphumelela kwaye abanye baya kuphumelela.
Not that he was thinking of meeting her again.	Akunjalo ukuba wayecinga ukudibana naye kwakhona.
I will have to take a test.	Kuya kufuneka ndenze uvavanyo.
I will do it and see what happens.	Ndiza kuyenza kwaye ndibone ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
That is even more true here.	Leyo yinyani ngakumbi apha.
Help with accommodation.	Nceda kwindawo yokuhlala.
Then the woman entered the house.	Emva koko umfazi wangena endlwini.
We have to go a long time ago then.	Kufuneka sihambe kudala ngoko.
He likes to walk alone a little bit.	Uthanda ukuhamba eyedwa kancinci.
That seems to be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi yiloo nto.
It will mean talking.	Kuya kuthetha ukuthetha.
He stayed with me, too.	Wahlala nam, naye.
So, sorry.	Ngoko, uxolo.
You did really well.	Wenze kakuhle ngokwenene.
He was going to have a party.	Wayeza kwenza itheko.
He tried anyway.	Wazama kunjalo.
This is all about me.	Konke oku malunga nam.
And he was not alone.	Kwaye wayengekho yedwa.
Well, he did something about it.	Ke, kukho into ayenzileyo ngayo.
He didn't seem to give up.	Wayengabonakali ukuyeka.
Without me it is.	Ngaphandle kwam kunjalo.
Or a woman for that.	Okanye umfazi ngaloo nto.
Yeah, that's all.	Ewe, yiyo yonke le nto.
He talked to me a little.	Wathetha nam kancinci.
I have to do something though.	Kufuneka ndenze into nangona kunjalo.
But then again, much more.	Kodwa kwakhona, kakhulu ngakumbi.
This is not necessary at all.	Oku akufuneki kwaphela.
So maybe we can talk to him.	Ngoko mhlawumbi siza kuthetha naye.
You will have to and do something about it.	Kuya kufuneka kwaye wenze into malunga naloo nto.
But then, it goes well.	Kodwa emva koko, kuhamba kakuhle.
You can't, you know.	Awukwazi, uyazi.
It will be better to stay longer.	Kuya kuba ngcono ukuhlala ixesha elide.
You always told him.	Umxelele njalo.
Really, it will be better.	Ngenene, kuya kuba ngcono.
You do not really want to do that.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwenza loo nto.
I just know what it is now.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba yintoni ngoku.
You need to spend more time outside.	Kufuneka wenze ixesha elingakumbi ngaphandle.
Really bad place !.	Indawo embi nyani!.
Only that will not be the case.	Kuphela oko akuyi kuba njalo.
Or one or the other.	Okanye enye okanye enye.
But why would you do that ?.	Kodwa kutheni ungayenza lonto?.
I graduated from college.	Ndagqiba ekholejini.
You're right there.	Ulungile apho.
We all need to be there.	Sonke kufuneka sibe lapho.
Here I am.	Ndim apha.
If there is no other way.	Ukuba akukho enye indlela.
This is possible, but not impossible.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He will not get better.	Akayi kuba ngcono.
But he too failed.	Kodwa naye akazange aphumelele.
And he is certainly not at home.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akakho ekhaya.
I don’t know what’s wrong with this job.	Andazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngalo msebenzi.
I try to stay.	Ndizama ukuhlala.
You will see that all is well.	Uya kubona ukuba konke kulungile.
It certainly seemed that way now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakubonakala kunjalo ngoku.
It must be a good job.	Umele abe ngumsebenzi olungileyo.
They will live together.	Baya kuhlala kunye.
I'm really glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ukuba lapha.
I don't know how that happened.	Andazi ukuba yenzeke njani loo nto.
I said nothing.	Andizange ndithethe nto.
Maybe nothing at this time, he thought.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto ngeli xesha, wacinga.
That's the way it looks to me.	Yiloo ndlela ebonakala ngayo kum.
It seemed like it was going to be easy.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuya kuba lula.
He would be human again.	Wayeza kuba ngumntu kwakhona.
So, that's really good.	Ngoko, oko kulungile ngenene.
There was nothing big here.	Kwakungekho nto enkulu apha.
A little bit at the beginning.	Kancinci kancinci ekuqaleni.
Yes, you are so lucky.	Ewe, unethamsanqa ngolo hlobo.
I will stay on this.	Ndiza kuhlala kule nto.
Obviously, something happened.	Ngokucacileyo, kukho into eyenzekileyo.
There seems to be no one at home.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho mntu ekhaya.
He was coming back from work.	Wayeza kubuya emsebenzini.
But there, everyone is like me.	Kodwa phaya, wonke umntu ufana nam.
But you know, it takes time to learn.	Kodwa uyazi, kuthatha ixesha ukufunda.
Yes, but it's okay.	Ewe, kodwa kulungile.
I think it will be fun.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba mnandi.
I hope your new job is going well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba umsebenzi wakho omtsha uhamba kakuhle.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo ngokwenene.
Although difficult to read.	Nangona kunzima ukufunda.
Yes, he died.	Ewe, wafa.
Or about you.	Okanye ngawe.
It's time to.	Lixesha lokuba .
You will be able to talk to anyone.	Uya kukwazi ukuthetha nabani na.
As much as you like.	Kakhulu njengoko uthanda.
He did, but he was not.	Wayenza, kodwa engekho.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngayo yonke into.
No, not another.	Hayi, hayi enye.
So he stayed behind late.	Ngoko wahlala emva kwexesha.
There was no other problem.	Kwakungekho enye ingxaki.
Not a toy.	Hayi into yokudlala.
He hasn’t run since.	Akazange aqhube ukusukela ngoko.
Of course not, either.	Akunjalo, okanye.
He asked for his help.	Wacela uncedo lwakhe.
And a beautiful woman.	Kwaye umfazi omhle.
Probably so.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kunjalo.
He didn't want to be with her.	Wayengafuni ukuba naye.
Not so in the beginning.	Akunjalo ekuqaleni.
Until we do that.	De siyenze loo nto.
You know, dog.	Uyazi, inja.
It will last up to a month.	Iya kuhlala ukuya kwinyanga.
He said no, he did not want to eat.	Wathi hayi, akafuni kutya.
But some are clearly not.	Kodwa abanye ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
Not a strange place.	Hayi indawo engaqhelekanga.
She ran downstairs to the house.	Wabaleka wehla waya endlini.
And he had to do so.	Kwaye kwafuneka enjenjalo.
But clearly, something happened.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, kukho into eyenzekayo.
However, nothing.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nto.
And this time you mean it.	Kwaye ngeli xesha uthetha oko.
We'll be back one day.	Siza kubuya ngenye imini.
Really, you should.	Ngokwenene, ufanele.
Not his people, not anyone.	Hayi abantu bakhe, hayi nabani na.
So if you make a speech, that's fine.	Ngoko ukuba wenza intetho, kulungile.
And really doing everything completely.	Kwaye ngokwenene ukwenza yonke into ngokupheleleyo.
I think a lot of all this.	Ndicinga kakhulu ngayo yonke le nto.
Maybe you should go.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhambe.
He would do nothing.	Wayeza kwenza nto.
Because that's the thing.	Kuba nantso into.
Thank you for doing so.	Enkosi ngokwenza njalo.
My mother stayed home.	Umama wahlala ekhaya.
OK, but not all.	Ilungile, kodwa hayi yonke.
That is what happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto.
I completely forgot about that.	Ndilibele ngokupheleleyo ngaloo nto.
I did not speak to him.	Andizange ndithethe naye.
Don't forget the plan.	Ungalibali icebo.
You do not have to stay longer than you would like.	Akufunekanga uhlale ixesha elide kunokuba uthanda.
The truth is that mom is hard.	Inyaniso kukuba umama kunzima.
The truth is that no one really knew what to do.	Inyaniso kukuba akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene ukuba enze ntoni.
She was afraid to meet him in town.	Wayesoyika ukudibana naye edolophini.
I thought you were.	Bendicinga ukuba wena .
I'm really sorry about that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokwenene ngaloo nto.
But there is far more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho kude ngakumbi ukuba akunjalo.
I wish to help everyone.	Ndinqwenela ukunceda bonke abantu.
What can I do?	Inokuba ndenza ntoni?
Before you say that, this is my thing.	Ngaphambi kokuba uthethe oko, le yinto yam.
I will leave soon.	Ndiza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
But, you have to stay.	Kodwa, kufuneka uhlale.
I came before him.	Ndifike phambi kwakhe.
But, now, he was not.	Kodwa, ngoku, wayengekho.
I'm glad to know that.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi oko.
He is almost a man.	Uphantse ukuba yindoda.
He makes it harder than it should be.	Wenza kube nzima kunokuba kufuneka.
I do not know how long it lasted.	Andazi ukuba kudala kangakanani.
He knew he would never leave now.	Wayesazi ukuba akanakuze ahambe ngoku.
Nobody did that perfectly in the same way.	Akukho mntu wenze loo nto ngokupheleleyo ngendlela efanayo.
It just takes learning more.	Kuthatha nje ukufunda ngakumbi.
Not just as we know it.	Akunjalo nje njengoko siyazi.
He told me once.	Undixelele kanye.
I never knew this.	Andizange ndiyazi le nto.
You make one mistake.	Uyenza impazamo enye.
I think it should, though.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka, nangona kunjalo.
Now, he looked around the room.	Ngoku, wajonga egumbini.
I certainly hope there is an exit.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyathemba ukuba kukho ukuphuma.
You know what that is.	Uyayazi ukuba yintoni na loo nto.
Yes, he is sleeping.	Ewe, ulele.
Then he had to take her home.	Emva koko kwafuneka ahambe naye agoduke.
I did not want her to know.	Ndandingafuni ukuba azi.
I think he knows what to do.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi into amakayenze.
We know that is not the case.	Siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
You must be here today.	Kufuneka ube lapha namhlanje.
And the answer is yes.	Kwaye impendulo kukuba kunjalo.
At his side.	Ecaleni lakhe.
Knowing where and being able to go.	Ukwazi apho kwaye ukwazi ukuya khona.
But not in front of me.	Kodwa hayi phambi kwam.
I hope no one will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akukho mntu uza kwenza njalo.
It does not appear to exist.	Kubonakala ngathi akakho.
Did he agree.	Ngaba wavuma .
And often, it is very difficult.	Kwaye rhoqo, kunzima kakhulu.
I saw it through you.	Ndibone ngawe.
But you do not know for sure.	Kodwa awuyazi ngokuqinisekileyo loo nto.
There is no real danger.	Akukho ngozi ngokwenene.
Dad finally returned home.	Ekugqibeleni uTata wabuyela ekhaya.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo apha.
I think everyone did a good job.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu wenze umsebenzi omhle.
He knew where he had to go.	Wayesazi apho kufuneka aye khona.
Really, this time.	Ngokwenene, ngeli xesha.
Maybe we made a mistake.	Mhlawumbi senze impazamo.
Yes that's almost it.	Ewe yiloo nto phantse.
Tell me more about it.	Ndixelele ngakumbi ngayo.
You have to wait out here.	Kufuneka ulinde apha phandle.
We need to move quickly on this.	Kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza kule nto.
I know you are interested.	Ndiyazi ukuba unomdla.
And obviously, everyone knows that.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo, wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
That's the way it is with driving.	Kunjalo ke ukuqhuba.
Maybe it will end soon.	Mhlawumbi iza kuphela kungekudala.
But not money.	Kodwa hayi imali.
I need to know how that happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
or.	okanye.
He did not know why now.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni ngoku.
Or because it is difficult.	Okanye ngenxa yokuba nzima.
He gave me a number.	Uye wandinika inombolo.
It seems too old.	Kubonakala kudala kakhulu.
He also stays up all night.	Naye uhlala ubusuku bonke.
And you can't think that, either.	Kwaye awukwazi ukucinga njalo, nawe.
For the work you have done here.	Ngomsebenzi owenze apha.
I have done the same.	Ndiye ndenza njalo nam.
You are good to me.	Ulungile kum.
You would love to be there with your friends.	Ungathanda kakhulu ukuba lapho kunye nabahlobo bakho.
He would speak only to us.	Wayeza kuthetha nathi kuphela.
We all want to succeed.	Sonke sifuna ukuphumelela.
He has done that since college.	Uyenzile oko ukusukela ekholejini.
Or just the other day.	Okanye nje ngenye imini.
We have to be there.	Sifanele sibe lapho.
To us, this is not the case.	Kuthi, oku akunjalo.
I don't want to do that again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndiyenze loo nto.
He didn't know what exactly that was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye leyo.
You never knew what you would get.	Awuzange wazi ukuba uya kufumana ntoni.
He is asleep at night.	Ulele ebusuku.
I will try to help you.	Ndiza kuzama ukukunceda.
I did this for myself.	Ndenze oku kum.
I'll see you soon.	Ndiza kubona ngokukhawuleza.
He was not alone.	Akazange abe yedwa.
No, that one.	Hayi, lowo.
He did not want to go with her.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba naye.
I'm too far gone now.	Ndihambe kakhulu ngoku.
I want you to think of something.	Ndifuna ucinge ngento ethile.
It's all yours.	Nguwe wonke.
I think it's right there.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile apho.
So he would go as fast as he could.	Ngoko wayeza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza, kunokwenzeka.
I wish they looked more like this.	Ndinqwenela ukuba abonakale ngakumbi ngolu hlobo.
Or long term, if you like.	Okanye ixesha elide, ukuba uyathanda.
See who is coming after you.	Jonga ukuba ngubani oza emva kwakho.
He wants everything.	Ufuna yonke into.
After all, it didn’t go well.	Emva koko, akuzange kube kuhle.
And your children.	Kunye nabantwana bakho.
Well, he better be.	Kulungile, kungcono abe.
Really badly done.	Yenziwe kakubi nyani.
But you really don't want to, you know.	Kodwa ngokwenene awufuni, uyazi.
Both at this time.	Bobabini ngeli xesha.
Now we know that to be true.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
I think that's a very bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi kakhulu.
The marriage lasted three years.	Umtshato wahlala iminyaka emithathu.
How long it will take.	Ingaba iza kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
Every morning.	Njalo kusasa.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga lento.
He did something very bad to you.	Wenza into embi kakhulu kuwe.
He looked anyway.	Wajonga kunjalo.
You can't think of your way there.	Awukwazi ukucinga indlela yakho apho.
And he did not want to buy.	Kwaye wayengafuni kuthenga.
Maybe not, but maybe not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, kodwa mhlawumbi.
And he wanted to go home.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuya ekhaya.
I want to do more and learn more.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngakumbi kwaye ndifunde ngakumbi.
This is all good work.	Lo ngumsebenzi olungileyo wonke.
He said he wanted the truth.	Wathi ufuna inyaniso.
He always went.	Wahamba njalo.
It has never been this difficult before.	Akuzange kube nzima ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
He never told me this before.	Akazange andixelele ngaphambili oku.
Anything but nothing.	Nantoni na kodwa akukho nto.
He wants to get out of there.	Ufuna ukuphuma phaya.
I have done it all before.	Ndenze konke ngaphambili.
Later a few more.	Kamva ezinye ezimbalwa.
He sits next to me.	Uhlala ecaleni kwam.
But you already know this.	Kodwa sele uyazi oku.
And mom? 	Kwaye umama?
Then he left quickly.	Emva koko wahamba ngokukhawuleza.
At first, that was not very high.	Ekuqaleni, oko kwakungekho phezulu kakhulu.
I think you should be better at that.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube ngcono kuloo nto.
Then, wait.	Emva koko, ulinde.
They will get there.	Baza kufika apho.
And he didn't, of course.	Kwaye akazange, kunjalo.
At that time you.	Ngelo xesha wena.
Soon you will be a better person.	Kungekudala uza kuba yinto engcono.
He didn't want to be in it.	Wayengafuni ukuba kuyo.
I know he won't.	Ndiyazi ukuba akayi.
They just stay all day.	Bahlala nje imini yonke.
He never said that to me.	Khange athethe lonto kum.
That's the thing about time.	Nantso into malunga nexesha.
Or tell someone else about it.	Okanye uxelele omnye umntu ngayo.
You will not succeed in me.	Awuyi kuphumelela kum.
Thank you for leaving immediately.	Enkosi kuba uye wahamba kwangoko.
Not everyone.	Hayi ngumntu wonke.
To me, at the time.	Kum, ngelo xesha.
Phone again.	Ifowuni kwakhona.
No, you did something about it.	Hayi, wenze into ngaye.
There is no playground.	Akukho ndawo yokudlala.
See books outside.	Jonga iincwadi ngaphandle.
I can't go.	Andikwazi ukuya.
Not too much to go with.	Akukho kakhulu ukuhamba nayo.
Certainly not.	Ngokwenene akunjalo.
Well, that's my new thing.	Ke, yinto yam entsha leyo.
Or even better.	Okanye nokuba kuhle.
You want a picture.	Ufuna umfanekiso.
I will find a good person.	Ndiza kufumana umntu olungileyo.
He looked up now.	Wajonga phezulu ngoku.
He agreed to stay.	Wavuma ukuhlala.
I knew a lot about him.	Ndandisazi kakhulu ngaye.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Oku kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
No, it does not have to be this way.	Hayi, akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
I could not tell you.	Khange ndikwazi ukukuxelela.
Well, this is not the case.	Ewe, oku akunjalo.
Well, not now.	Ewe, hayi ngoku.
There is no going back after that.	Akukho kubuya emva koko.
He didn't, you know.	Akazange, uyazi.
He had to leave immediately.	Kwafuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
He would like that to happen.	Angathanda ukuba oko kwenzeke.
Yes, that's fine.	Ewe, kube kuhle.
I love it, it will definitely buy it again.	Ndiyayithanda, ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuthenga kwakhona.
Not so either.	Akunjalo nokuba kunjalo.
So there is no need for a new one.	Ngoko ke akukho mfuneko entsha.
He was talking after dinner, of course.	Wayethetha emva kwesidlo, kunjalo.
If not, no.	Ukuba akunjalo, hayi.
I'm trying to find one.	Ndizama ukufumana enye.
He never really talked to me.	Khange athethe nam nyani.
He lives here a long time.	Uhlala ixesha elide apha.
He works late in the office.	Usebenza emva kwexesha eofisini.
No problem tonight.	Akukho ngxaki ngokuhlwanje.
I don't care what it takes.	Andikhathali nokuba kuthatha ntoni na.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka kwaphela.
Yes, otherwise.	Ewe, ngaphandle koko.
He looked up again, suddenly.	Wajonga phezulu kwakhona, ngokukhawuleza.
He definitely has to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ahambe.
I always do.	Ndihlala ndenza njalo.
And one tomorrow.	Kwaye enye ngomso.
I told you, he's not human at all.	Ndikuxelele, akangomntu kwaphela.
For almost anything.	Kuba phantse nantoni na.
I do not want to eat.	Andifuni kutya.
Maybe it will do something.	Mhlawumbi iya kwenza into.
He did not know what to expect.	Wayengazi ukuba ulindele ntoni na.
But is that true ?.	Kodwa yinyani leyo?.
But, there was no need for him to do so.	Kodwa, kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
You think about it for a few days.	Ucinga ngayo iintsuku ezimbalwa.
And yet it happens very often.	Kwaye kunjalo kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
He tried to get help.	Wazama ukufumana uncedo.
I thought you needed help or something.	Bendicinga ukuba ufuna uncedo okanye enye into.
Mostly, he knew, but still.	Kakhulu, wayesazi, kodwa nangoko.
I really want you to stay there with me.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba uhlale apho kunye nam.
Everyone is fine now.	Wonke umntu ulungile ngoku.
Her father did her best.	Utata wakhe wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
There is one answer.	Kukho impendulo enye.
She is not in her room, she is not in her room.	Akakho egumbini lakhe, akakho egumbini lakhe.
You know enough.	Uyazi ngokwaneleyo.
This has never happened before.	Oku akuzange kube khona ngaphambili.
He knows something is coming to him.	Uyazi ukuba kukho into eza kuye.
He said he did.	Wathi wenze njalo.
His name, he thought.	Igama lakhe, wacinga.
My mother has gone out.	Umama uye waphuma.
Long time no see.	Kudala ndikwazi.
But now he sat down and thought.	Kodwa ngoku wahlala phantsi wacinga.
He thought about it every day.	Wayecinga ngayo yonke imihla.
It has never been so before.	Akuzange kube njalo ngaphambili.
But you are scared.	Kodwa wena uyoyika.
It takes time, yes.	Kuthatha ixesha, ewe.
And maybe he didn't.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akazange.
My mother is not really like that.	Umama akanjalo nyani.
Please, he thought.	Nceda, wacinga.
Or your name.	Okanye igama lakho.
I have never done anything like it before.	Andizange ndiphinde ndiyenze into enje.
Good living in a new place.	Ukuhlala kakuhle kwindawo entsha.
But it did not happen to me.	Kodwa akuzange kum.
I tried, once.	Ndazama, kanye.
It would be great to have him with us.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba naye kunye nathi.
But he did not want to leave immediately.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngalo.
That's a good player.	Ngumdlali olungileyo lowo.
Some will say the phone.	Abanye baya kuthi ifowuni.
And again it did not.	Kwaye kwakhona akuzange.
I don't want to see more.	Andifuni ukubona ngakumbi.
He thought it was time.	Wayecinga ukuba lixesha.
What is here.	Yintoni na apha.
So that's exactly right.	Ngoko ilungile kanye loo nto.
It happens to be my place, too.	Kwenzeka ukuba indawo yam, kakhulu.
Our approach is right, right.	Indlela yethu ilungile, ilungile.
You think you are right.	Ucinga ukuba ulungile.
He spoke for days.	Wathetha iintsuku.
I don't think you have to do that.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
Good to know!.	Kuhle ukwazi!.
However, you can not run yet.	Nangona kunjalo, awukwazi ukuqhuba okwangoku.
You will surely succeed.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuphumelela.
I can't walk right away.	Andikwazi ukuhamba kwangoko.
Don't try to do too much.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza kakhulu.
In all money.	Kuyo yonke imali.
You feel when you want or want.	Uziva xa ufuna okanye ufuna.
This is our thing.	Yinto yethu le.
They all go to him.	Bonke baya kuye.
They say almost nothing.	Bathi phantse akukho nto.
Maybe he wanted to help.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukunceda.
Thus, he made a feast.	Ngaloo ndlela, wenza itheko.
This way I will do it.	Ngale ndlela ndiza kuyenza.
I can't get my mind on that.	Andikwazi ukufumana ingqondo yam kuloo nto.
No, not at all.	Hayi, bonke.
He wanted to be there.	Wayefuna ukuba khona.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Wandixelela into afuna ukuyenza.
I never thought of it, you know.	Khange ndicinge nto ngayo, uyazi.
Today and every day.	Namhlanje kwaye yonke imihla.
He promised to be back soon.	Wathembisa ukuba uza kubuya kungekudala.
And this is exactly what it is.	Kwaye lo unjalo kanye.
I need to know about this.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngale nto.
And the window.	Kwaye ifestile.
This is more difficult than it first appears.	Oku kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba kubonakala ekuqaleni.
Long, long days.	Ixesha elide, iintsuku ezininzi.
And most of all, there is no food.	Kwaye ngaphezu kwakho konke, akukho kutya.
It certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kwenza.
Maybe that's you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe lowo.
I hope it is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile kuwe.
You better come sooner.	Kungcono uze ngokukhawuleza.
You will be in pain for a long time.	Uya kuba buhlungu ixesha elide.
I wanted to go to school.	Ndandifuna ukuya esikolweni.
They will do it.	Baya kuyenza.
Just walking around the place.	Ukuhamba nje kwindawo.
He loves attention.	Uyayithanda ingqalelo.
Tell me again how it happened.	Ndixelele kwakhona ukuba kwenzeke njani.
And finally, they said yes.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, bathi ewe.
And well! 	Kwaye kakuhle!
You definitely want a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna indawo.
It would be easy enough, he thought.	Kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo, wayecinga.
To tell you that.	Ukukuxelela oko.
They stay late.	Bahlala emva kwexesha.
I wanted to see the place.	Bendifuna ukubona indawo.
However, this is not very likely.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
Success.	Ukuphumelela.
I am supposed to .	Ndifanele ukuba .
I went to see.	Ndaya kubona.
He thought it best to talk as little as possible.	Wacinga ukuba kungcono athethe kancinci kangangoko.
If so.	Ukuba ngoko .
I heard the same thing.	Ndeva into efanayo.
If you expect to get better, you will.	Ukuba ulindele ukuba ngcono, uya kuba njalo.
He did not want a car.	Akazange afune imoto.
Just too much.	Kakhulu nje.
If you play football.	Ukuba udlala ibhola .
Where.	Kule .
Personally, this is good for me.	Ngokwam, oku kulungile kum.
But this he seemed to do.	Kodwa oku wabonakala ekwenza.
He looked at her side.	Wajonga ecaleni kwakhe.
But then it goes forward.	Kodwa ke iya phambili.
I want you to think about that.	Ndifuna ucinge ngaloo nto.
Me and you and him.	Mna nawe kunye naye.
That's yours.	Yinto yakho leyo.
I am the only one with it.	Ndim ndedwa andinayo.
I'm glad you can be there.	Ndiyavuya unokuba lapho.
Or he wanted to.	Okanye wayefuna.
You spoke to him recently.	Uthethe naye mva nje.
Yes that's right.	Ewe, oko kulungile.
You may like that.	Ungathanda oko.
He makes his time.	Wenza ixesha lakhe.
Check up .	Jonga .
I thought not.	Ndandicinga ukuba akunjalo.
We had better be harder.	Kungcono sibe nzima kakhulu.
Not everyone does, though.	Ayinguye wonke umntu nangona kunjalo.
We want more people.	Sifuna abanye abantu.
Finally, he left.	Ekugqibeleni, wahamba.
Give me your place.	Ndinike indawo yakho.
Yes, it is absolutely impossible.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
Nice to meet you.	Kuhle ukudibana nawe.
He tried to stay but could not.	Wazama ukuhlala kodwa akakwazi.
This is my age.	Iminyaka yam yile.
You are the one who wants the money.	Nguwe ofuna imali.
Getting home will be fine.	Ukufika ekhaya kuya kuba kuhle.
It will do three things.	Kuya kwenza izinto ezintathu.
But, another small problem.	Kodwa, enye ingxaki encinci.
I just don’t know what to do with the money.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze ntoni ngemali.
You can be my friend.	Unokuba ngumhlobo wam.
I've seen enough here.	Ndibone ngokwaneleyo apha.
Music, for sure.	Umculo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
At the moment he did not know how long he would come.	Okwangoku wayengazi ukuba uza kude kube nini.
He works regularly.	Usebenza rhoqo.
But, it seems okay.	Kodwa, kubonakala kulungile.
I know you are there.	Ndiyamazi ukhona.
What will happen to you.	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
He too did not want to see anything.	Naye wayengafuni ukubona nto.
But he will come in the evening.	Kodwa uya kuza ngokuhlwa.
Even more so.	Ngakumbi .
I came here.	Ndifike apha.
Probably more difficult.	Mhlawumbi nzima ngakumbi.
Thank you, please.	Enkosi, nceda.
There is no reason here.	Akukho sizathu apha.
And it will not last long.	Kwaye asiyi kuhlala ixesha elide.
He has gone down fast.	Uye wehla ngokukhawuleza.
Always together.	Ngalo lonke ixesha bobabini kunye.
But this time, that's it.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, yiloo nto.
One did not.	Omnye akenzanga.
Can anyone please tell me what is wrong.	Ngaba nabani na ndicela andixelele ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
And doing homework.	Kwaye ukwenza umsebenzi wasekhaya.
No, we certainly need to do that.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
The doctor would come soon, too.	Ugqirha wayeza kufika kungekudala, naye.
Nobody ever knew it was me.	Akukho mntu wakha wazi ukuba ndim.
Maybe it looked that way.	Mhlawumbi kwakubonakala ngolo hlobo.
I can do that at home.	Ndingayenza lonto ekhaya.
You live there and you live there and you live there.	Uhlala apho kwaye uhlala apho kwaye uhlala khona.
This certainly seemed to us.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku kwakubonakala ngathi.
However, here's another one for me.	Nangona kunjalo, apha kum enye.
He looked down at his daughter.	Wajonga intombi yakhe phantsi.
Well first let me do it.	Kulungile kuqala mandiyenze.
There is just no money in it.	Akukho mali nje kuyo.
But no, not her mother.	Kodwa hayi, hayi umama wakhe.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba.
We'll talk to you soon.	Siza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
I thought though.	Bendicinga kodwa.
Next week, next month, but not later.	Kwiveki ezayo, kwinyanga ezayo, kodwa hayi kamva.
If you just got here.	Ukuba ufike nje apha.
You have been working here for a long time.	Kudala usebenza apha.
Don't forget to eat.	Ungalibali ukutya.
He knew everything about me.	Wayesazi konke ngam.
Maybe you just came for me.	Mhlawumbi uze nje ngenxa yam.
He went right into her.	Wangena kuye kanye.
There is death.	Kukho ukufa.
She arrived shortly.	Ufike kungekudala.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala nayo.
I don't know more.	Andazi ngakumbi.
And the truth is.	Kwaye inyaniso kukuba.
I don't think it will be good.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
Maybe he would come.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kufika.
Maybe he would be able to do that.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kukwazi ukwenjenjalo.
Probably throughout the house.	Mhlawumbi kuyo yonke indlu.
She tries to talk to him all day.	Uzama ukuthetha nayo imini yonke.
This is your job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wakho.
Finishing again is good.	Ukugqiba kwakhona kuhle.
And your mother, a little bit.	Kwaye umama wakho, kancinci.
You may have done this.	Usenokuba uyenzile le nto.
I wanted to succeed.	Ndandifuna ukuphumelela kakubi.
Maybe you would like to go.	Mhlawumbi ungathanda ukuya.
I think he thought it would be good for him.	Ndicinga ukuba wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kuye.
He has done so.	Uye wenza njalo.
Obviously, this is not necessary.	Ngokucacileyo, oku akuyomfuneko.
Yes this will happen, as soon as possible.	Ewe oku kuya kwenzeka, ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
In fact, he had to leave.	Inyaniso kukuba, kwafuneka ahambe.
He does this every day.	Wenza oku yonke imihla.
Music has a big problem with that.	Umculo unengxaki enkulu kuloo nto.
I did not want her to be alone.	Ndandingafuni abe yedwa.
Not yet .	Hayi ngoku .
She's gone and she doesn't know where.	Uye wahamba kwaye akazi apho.
And people will just sit there.	Kwaye abantu baya kuhlala nje apho.
So performance should already be there.	Ngoko ukusebenza kufuneka kube sele kukho.
I talk to him all the time.	Ndithetha naye ngalo lonke ixesha.
Finally, he found a plan.	Ekugqibeleni, wafumana icebo.
And no one asked.	Kwaye akukho mntu wabuza.
Not your name, nothing.	Hayi igama lakho, akukho nto.
You will get better at it.	Uya kuba ngcono kuyo.
I will first speak.	Ndiza kuqala ndithethe.
But the dates have to be right.	Kodwa imihla kufuneka ilungile.
You may still be.	Usenokuba nangoku.
But he will not do that.	Kodwa akayi kuyenza loo nto.
This will last.	Oku kuya kuhlala.
Everything is OK.	Yonke into ILUNGILE.
Or really years.	Okanye ngokwenene iminyaka.
I will not try.	Andiyi kuzama.
But maybe not as much as you.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu njengawe.
Come with you.	Weza nawe.
he cannot stay long.	akakwazi kuhlala ixesha elide.
He told me all about her.	Wandixelela konke ngaye.
We will probably need more hours.	Mhlawumbi siya kufuna iiyure ezininzi.
There is always the future.	Kuhlala kukho ixesha elizayo.
A long time ago, now.	Kudala kakhulu, ngoku.
Our father obviously made a mistake.	Utata wethu kucacile ukuba uyayenza impazamo.
Maybe just bad.	Mhlawumbi embi nje.
I just want to see what happens.	Ndifuna nje ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
You understood last night.	Uye waqonda phezolo.
I can do it, too.	Ndingayenza, nam.
One day you may know.	Ngenye imini usenokuba uyazi.
This one you can have.	Le unokuba nayo.
Kidding me.	Udlala ngam.
Nice to meet you too.	Nam ndiyavuya ukudibana nawe.
I knew something was going to happen there in the end.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka apho ekugqibeleni.
A real gun.	Umpu ngokwenene.
But in the end it is true.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni yinyani.
I only spoke to him last week.	Kuphela ndithethe naye kwiveki ephelileyo.
It's hard to imagine how.	Kunzima ukucinga ukuba njani.
As you will do.	Njengoko uya kwenza wena.
That is my job.	Ngumsebenzi wam ke lowo.
They say no.	Bathi akunjalo.
He stayed away.	Wahlala kude.
About all of that.	Malunga nayo yonke loo nto.
He sat down and slept for a while.	Wahlala phantsi walala kancinci.
Who's up ?.	Ngubani phezulu?.
Of course no one is there.	Ewe akukho mntu apho.
I really wanted to go.	Bendifuna ukuhamba nyani.
So you will have to wait another day.	Ngoko kuya kufuneka ulinde ngenye imini.
Stop talking and do something.	Yeka ukuthetha wenze into.
If that's okay with you.	Ukuba oko kulungile nawe.
Or each other.	Okanye omnye komnye.
And then one has to seek.	Kwaye ke umntu kufuneka afune.
But you can't stay there.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala apho.
Most of the time the food is good.	Ixesha elininzi ukutya kulungile.
Well, there is a problem.	Kulungile, kukho ingxaki.
He likes to express his mind.	Uyathanda ukuthetha ingqondo yakhe.
It is possible.	Kunokwenzeka.
And you will be in it.	Kwaye uya kuba kuyo.
That's right then.	Yinyani ke ngoko.
Whenever you like.	Nanini na xa uthanda.
Now this is the thing.	Ngoku le yinto.
You go to it though.	Uya kuyo nangona kunjalo.
Man is much better.	Umntu ungcono kakhulu.
But, this is not about me.	Kodwa, oku akukho malunga nam.
Now, you have to stay here.	Ngoku, kufuneka uhlale apha.
I couldn't do it.	Andikwazanga ukwenza.
He looked bad, of course.	Wayekhangeleka embi, kunjalo.
And you can do that.	Kwaye ungayenza loo nto.
But not without him.	Kodwa hayi ngaphandle kwakhe.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange amxelele.
Don't come here.	Musa ukuza apha.
Ok thanks.	Kulungile, enkosi.
I start at the beginning.	Ndiyaqala ekuqaleni.
There was nothing he would like to do better.	Kwakungekho nto angathanda ukuyenza ngcono.
He won't have it.	Akayi kuba nayo.
And then in the house.	Kwaye ke endlini.
There may be someone in his office.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kukho umntu eofisini yakhe.
He is not far off.	Akakho kude.
Thank you so much for everything !.	Enkosi kakhulu ngayo yonke into!.
He opened the door slightly and looked inside.	Wavula ucango kancinci wajonga ngaphakathi.
He never thought of anything else.	Akazange acinge ngayo enye into.
Whatever it will do.	Nantoni na iya kuyenza.
You know it too.	Uyayazi nawe.
Work progressed quickly.	Umsebenzi wahamba ngokukhawuleza.
I can't do it all.	Andikwazi ukuyenza yonke.
You have to be there.	Kufuneka ube phaya.
Without time.	Ngaphandle kwexesha.
But tell me why.	Kodwa ndixelele ukuba kutheni.
Or maybe you are telling the truth.	Okanye mhlawumbi uthetha inyani.
But we did not make money.	Kodwa asizange senze imali.
Everyone would be here soon.	Wonke umntu wayeza kuba apha kungekudala.
So he returned home.	Ngoko wabuyela ekhaya.
You waste time on me.	Uchitha ixesha kum.
What I feel is him.	Oko ndiziva ukuba nguye.
True in every way.	Yinyani ngayo yonke indlela.
But you can't leave right away.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhamba kwangoko.
It's hard to do that.	Kunzima ukuyenza loo nto.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba .
I don't have to have it.	Akufunekanga ndibe nayo.
Of course not.	Hayi ke.
But there is something wrong with the job.	Kodwa kukho into embi emsebenzini.
For us.	Ngokwethu.
I mean all night.	Ndithetha ubusuku bonke.
But the work went well.	Kodwa umsebenzi wahamba kakuhle.
Unless we did not.	Ngaphandle kokuba asizange senze njalo.
John succeeded.	UJohn uphumelele.
Tall, though, and beautiful.	Mde, nangona kunjalo, kwaye mhle.
Not so, anytime.	Hayi ngoko, nanini na.
He has come here.	Uye weza apha.
He would like her to be his friend too.	Angathanda ukuba naye abe ngumhlobo wakhe.
Most people will say no.	Abantu abaninzi baya kuthi hayi.
The doctor came in the morning.	Uye wafika ugqirha kusasa.
Her son will then have to go home alone.	Unyana wakhe ke ngoko kuya kufuneka agoduke yedwa.
No, I have heard.	Hayi, ndive.
I have never heard of you before.	Andizange ndive ngawe ngaphambili.
Or tomorrow.	Okanye kusasa.
It seemed more.	Kwakubonakala ngakumbi.
He's here, and this is now.	Ulapha, kwaye oku ngoku.
I'm starting to get the big picture.	Ndiyaqala ukufumana umfanekiso omkhulu.
She thought she was beautiful.	Wayecinga ukuba mhle.
It should have been done.	Bekufanele ukuba yenziwe.
You deserve to succeed.	Ufanele ukuphumelela.
Or my daughter.	Okanye intombi yam.
New reality.	Inyani entsha.
It's just that everyone does it.	Kuphela nje ukuba wonke umntu uyayenza.
Everything is fine, look.	Yonke into ilungile, jonga.
He wanted to go, but he just walked away.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kunjalo nje wahamba.
He came to me.	Weza kwam.
I heard it down there.	Ndive phantsi phaya.
He is often alone.	Udla ngokuba wedwa.
Again, my peace.	Kwakhona, uxolo lwam.
And he would try harder.	Kwaye wayeza kuzama ngakumbi.
Then, at home, in your place.	Emva koko, ekhaya, kwindawo yakho.
There is a place for you here.	Kukho indawo yakho apha.
He lives out here.	Uhlala apha phandle.
Or if you know what it will be like.	Okanye ukuba uyazi ukuba iya kuba njani.
Then everyone will want to come.	Emva koko wonke umntu uya kufuna ukuza.
He left in the afternoon.	Wemka emva kwemini.
You do not have to sit down.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uhlale phantsi.
He came in a little bit.	Wangena kancinci kancinci.
He wouldn't have it, though.	Wayengayi kuba nayo, nangona kunjalo.
Work will continue.	Umsebenzi uza kuqhubeka.
I want to talk.	Ndifuna ukuthetha.
You never came.	Awuzange ufike.
He walks people though.	Uhamba abantu kodwa.
Anyone knows what the problem might be.	Nabani na uyayazi ingxaki inokuba yintoni .
I'm happy friend.	Ndiyavuya ngumhlobo.
Last night he slept there.	Phezolo uye walala apho.
He found his way.	Wafumana indlela yakhe.
Not better or worse.	Hayi ngcono okanye embi.
But that is my hope.	Kodwa lithemba lam elo.
Maybe it will happen one day.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
Not at all, that would not be good.	Akunjalo konke konke, oko akuyi kuba kuhle.
When there is one, there are two.	Xa kukho enye, kukho ezimbini.
These, and so on.	Ezi, njalo njalo.
He is the One who made it all possible.	Nguye owenze konke kwenzeke.
He did not think so.	Akazange acinge ngolo hlobo.
This is not possible before.	Oku akunakwenzeka ngaphambili.
He had to try to talk to her.	Kwafuneka azame ukuthetha naye.
All in town.	Konke edolophini.
No one has ever tried.	Akukho mntu wakhe wazama.
It was good for me, though.	Kube kuhle kum, nangona kunjalo.
Is that really the case though.	Ngaba kunjalo ngokwenene nangona kunjalo.
Thank you all.	Enkosi kuthi sonke.
I need to see our father.	Kufuneka ndibone utata wethu.
She has come to my room.	Uye weza egumbini lam.
He had to help.	Kwafuneka ancede.
I don't have it now.	Andinayo ngoku.
This will not be the case for you.	Oku akuyi kuba njani kuwe.
No, one.	Hayi, omnye.
He seemed to be talking to her.	Wabonakala ethetha kuyo.
I'm not there enough.	Andikho apho ngokwaneleyo.
No problem with anything.	Akukho ngxaki nantoni na.
That will be easier to do.	Oko kuya kuba lula ukwenza.
He wants it to happen again.	Ufuna ukuba yenzeke kwakhona.
I wish I was.	Ndingathanda ukuba ndim.
You will have to go with it.	Kuya kufuneka uhambe nayo.
Of course you do not want to go there.	Ewe awufuni ukuya apho.
The answer will be.	Impendulo iya kuba .
He would not be able to see.	Wayengayi kukwazi ukubona.
If you know.	Ukuba uyazi.
It will be difficult to make time for him.	Kuya kuba nzima ukwenza ixesha lakhe.
Good mistake.	Impazamo entle.
And really now.	Kwaye ngokwenene ngoku.
But it can be.	Kodwa inokuba njalo.
Not so with his wife.	Akanjalo umfazi wakhe.
He wanted a little something to do with it.	Wayefuna into encinci yokwenza nayo.
Last month.	Kwinyanga ephelileyo.
I think, this place is good.	Ndicinga ukuba, le ndawo ilungile.
This is time consuming.	Oku kutya ixesha.
He too wanted everything.	Naye wayefuna konke.
I want it to happen quickly.	Ndifuna ukuba yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He did this with her in the room.	Uye wayenza lento naye egumbini.
However, they stayed with it.	Nangona kunjalo, bahlala nayo.
But I can't find a way to do it.	Kodwa andikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza.
We had to do it ourselves.	Kwafuneka siyenze ngokwethu.
Stop acting like you.	Yeka ukwenza njengawe.
Good to say.	Kuhle ukuyithetha.
Up, up, and away.	Phezulu, phezulu, kwaye kude.
I have no time before that.	Andinaxesha phambi koko.
I'm just trying to do my job here.	Ndizama nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam apha.
Question about your time.	Umbuzo ngexesha lakho.
That means both.	Oko kuthetha ukuba bobabini.
But then again, probably not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi ayizange.
His work has been.	Umsebenzi wakhe uye waba.
What really happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo ngokwenene.
But he finally agreed.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wavuma.
He'll say soon, that's right.	Uya kuthi kungekudala, kunjalo.
However, it is not there and it is not there.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho apho kwaye akukho apho.
Good or bad.	Elungileyo okanye embi.
But he is there.	Kodwa ukhona.
Your people are everywhere.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo abantu bakho.
I will get his attention.	Ndiza kufumana ingqalelo yakhe.
I'll see you soon, soon.	Ndiza kubona ngokwenene, kungekudala.
It's not fun at all.	Akukho mnandi kwaphela.
All of this can be quite unusual.	Konke oku kunokuba yinto nje engaqhelekanga.
He refused to talk about it.	Akazange avume ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
They live out there.	Bahlala phaya phandle.
Everyone wants to succeed, everyone wants to do well.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuphumelela, wonke umntu ufuna ukwenza kakuhle.
Do not make it difficult.	Musa ukwenza kube nzima.
It will definitely happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka.
And then someone opened the music up.	Kwaye emva koko umntu wavula umculo phezulu.
And he didn't know how.	Kwaye wayengazi ukuba njani.
Something strange happened to me.	Kwenzeke into engaqhelekanga kum.
Even well it still is.	Nokuba kulungile kunjalo.
No one should know about us, though.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba azi ngathi, nangona kunjalo.
He is my man.	Nguye umntu wam.
Maybe he won't be back today.	Mhlawumbi akasayi kubuya namhlanje.
It can be that simple.	Inokuba lula ngolo hlobo.
I want to get out, away from him.	Ndifuna ukuphuma, kude kuye.
He has become my friend.	Uye waba ngumhlobo wam.
After that, he did just that.	Emva koko, wayedla ngokwenza njalo.
I really have to go.	Kufuneka ndihambe nyani.
And this is not going to happen.	Kwaye oku akuyi kwenzeka.
If you work with us you will see.	Ukuba usebenza nathi uya kubona.
I will take that risk.	Ndiza kuthatha loo ngozi.
Well, our approach is right.	Ke, indlela yethu ilungile.
Here, it is not.	Apha, akunjalo.
It's all right now.	Ilungile ngoku.
Not that he looked.	Hayi ukuba wajonga.
And they will come after me.	Kwaye baya kuza emva kwam.
A good car is a reality.	Imoto entle yinyani.
Good place.	Indawo elungileyo.
They drowned anything.	Wazama nantoni na.
If you do, that's fine.	Ukuba wenza njalo, kuhle.
He found another way to be in it.	Wafumana enye indlela yokuba kuyo.
But I mean more.	Kodwa ndithetha ngakumbi.
He opened the controversy.	Wavula utata.
He was not the only one.	Yayingenguye lowo kwaphela.
I'm happy this time.	Ndiyavuya ngeli xesha.
And we did it very early.	Kwaye siyenze kwangoko kakhulu.
And he would never know, not for sure.	Kwaye akanakuze azi, hayi ngokuqinisekileyo.
And of course, there is new music.	Kwaye kunjalo, kukho umculo omtsha.
If you are unable to do so, please come.	Ukuba awukwazi ukwenza njalo, nceda uze.
The truth is look at everything.	Inyani jonga yonke into.
No accidents, no accidents.	Akukho ngozi, akukho ngozi.
I don't even know how long.	Andazi nokuba kude kube nini.
You may have done so.	Usenokuba wenze njalo.
Stop doing that !.	Yeka ukwenza oko!.
Above all .	Ngaphezu koko .
He would like to.	Angathanda .
I mean flowers.	Ndithetha iintyatyambo.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Akukho nto inokuba yinyani ngakumbi.
I should not do it.	Akufanele ndiyenze.
Tell me, you know.	Ndixelele, wazi.
If you look up.	Ukuba ujonge phezulu.
I just love this thing.	Ndiyayithanda le nto nje.
Or he did.	Okanye wenza.
No problem then.	Akukho ngxaki ke.
Where is my mistake? 	Iphi impazamo yam?
He wanted my money.	Wayefuna imali yam.
You can do this.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza le nto.
It will be something to do.	Kuya kuba yinto yokwenza.
I didn't know any.	Bendingazi noba yeyiphi.
I really doubt who did that to me.	Ndiyathandabuza ngokwenene ukuba ngubani owenze loo nto kum.
Please let us go.	Ndicela sihambe.
You want to work.	Ufuna ukusebenza.
I thought you could make money.	Ndandicinga ukuba uyakwazi ukwenza imali.
I'll come back later.	Ndiza kubuya emva koko.
Thanks again for being with me.	Enkosi kwakhona ngokuba nam.
I know what death means now.	Ndiyazi ukuba ukufa kuthetha ntoni ngoku.
This is how it all happened.	Kwenzeka ngolo hlobo ke konke oku.
He wants you to leave.	Ufuna ukuba uhambe.
I hope everything is fine.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yonke into ilungile.
No one is very interested here.	Akukho mntu unomdla kakhulu apha.
I think it's better that way.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono ngolo hlobo.
I will do that right now.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto kanye ngoku.
That is why he must stay away from her.	Yiyo ke loo nto kufuneka ukuba ahlale kude naye.
And you know how to do it.	Kwaye uyayazi indlela yokwenza.
He did not want to go to college.	Wayengafuni ukuya ekholejini.
It should not happen this way.	Akufunekanga yenzeke ngolu hlobo.
He has returned to it.	Uye wabuyela kuyo.
A few years, for sure.	Iminyaka embalwa, ngokuqinisekileyo.
What is your name? 	Ngubani igama lakho?
His coming shortly thereafter.	Ukuza kwakhe kungekudala emva koko.
So he went in there.	Wahamba ke wangena apho.
He can't do that to her.	Akanakuyenza loo nto kuye.
All of this happened because of you.	Konke oku kwenzeke ngenxa yakho.
I wish that could happen.	Ndinqwenela ukuba oko kwenzeke.
We all want to move forward.	Sonke sifuna ukuya phambili.
He tries another way.	Uzama ngenye indlela.
I don't want you talking.	Andifuni uthetha.
But he knew, for sure.	Kodwa wayesazi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Just look where you live.	Jonga nje apho uhlala khona.
In the end this will be a good thing.	Ekugqibeleni oku kuya kuba yinto entle.
He asked how he did it.	Wabuza ukuba wenze njani.
Yes, that's good for you.	Ewe, kuhle kuwe.
And he also does not want to.	Kwaye naye akafuni.
Nobody goes that way.	Akukho mntu uhamba ngaloo ndlela.
Is it possible to do that.	Ngaba kunokwenzeka ukwenza oko.
Then go with you.	Emva koko uhambe nawe.
But if you do.	Kodwa ukuba wenza.
He didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze njani.
I want everything about him.	Ndifuna yonke into ngaye.
He didn't want another one.	Akazange afune enye.
I really couldn't tell you.	Ngenene andikwazanga ukukuxelela.
Everyone knows that place.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo ndawo.
I couldn't think of it for long.	Andizange ndikwazi ukucinga ngayo ixesha elide.
That starts with you.	Oko kuqala ngawe.
Nothing at all.	Akukho kwanto.
I thought it would never happen.	Ndandicinga ukuba soze yenzeke.
He didn't want to, yet.	Wayengafuni, okwangoku.
Or expect to know.	Okanye ulindele ukwazi.
But he could not come.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuza.
His mother thought so.	Umama wakhe wayecinga ngolo hlobo.
But not everyone.	Kodwa akunjalo wonke umntu.
Carrying out your work should not be so difficult.	Ukuqhuba umsebenzi wakho akufuneki kube nzima kangako.
He cannot speak at all.	Akakwazi kwaphela ukuthetha.
I have thought about it for a long time.	Ndiye ndacinga ixesha elide ngayo.
Even if he didn't at first.	Nokuba akazange ekuqaleni.
She goes to my school.	Uya esikolweni sam.
At that moment he said no.	Ngelo xesha wathi hayi.
He took my call.	Uye wathatha umnxeba wam.
What are you doing outside? 	Wenza ntoni ngaphandle?
You do not have to wait.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ulinde.
He asked me to wait.	Uye wandicela ukuba ndilinde.
No one thinks a bit about me.	Akukho mntu ucinga kancinci ngam.
It will take a new path.	Kuya kuthatha indlela entsha.
It was not necessary, either.	Kwakungeyomfuneko, mhlawumbi.
I thought it would be really good.	Bendicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle ngenene.
He knew it would come to him.	Wayesazi ukuba iya kufika kuye.
In the same way, a doctor can never make mistakes.	Ngendlela efanayo, ugqirha akanakuze enze iimpazamo.
You can't think straight.	Awukwazi ukucinga kakuhle.
To do something right is to do a lot.	Ukwenza into kakuhle kukwenza okuninzi.
It just comes to you.	Iza kuwe nje.
No one has time.	Akukho mntu unexesha.
But there are many more.	Kodwa kukho abanye abaninzi.
Now he realized that it was not a joke.	Ngoku waqonda ukuba asiyonto yokudlala.
He has really fallen asleep.	Uye walala ngenene.
His picture stayed with him long after that.	Umfanekiso wakhe wahlala naye ixesha elide emva koko.
I am well aware that this is not easy.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba oku akukho lula.
No one asked me to do this.	Akukho mntu wandicela ukuba ndiyenze le nto.
He agreed.	Wavuma oko.
You happen to love him.	Kwenzeka ukuba uyamthanda.
What happened.	Kwenzeka ntoni na.
As it would be with anyone.	Njengoko bekuya kuba njalo nabani na.
There is another way, a better way.	Kukho enye indlela, indlela engcono.
The man knew a lot about her.	Umntu wayesazi okuninzi kakhulu ngaye.
Then say to him.	Uze uthi kuye.
But he also could not control himself.	Kodwa naye akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
Almost immediately.	Phantse ngoko nangoko.
There you are, only once.	Nantso ke, kube kanye.
I know he will come to you.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuza kuwe.
I could not go that far.	Andikwazanga ukuya kude kangako.
Either way, it can be very difficult.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, inokuba nzima kakhulu.
That too is perfectly fine.	Naloo nto ilungile ngokupheleleyo.
Or in the afternoon.	Okanye emva kwemini.
We have never been in that situation.	Zange sibe kuloo meko.
I think this will make a big picture.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kwenza umfanekiso omkhulu.
We do not have to go far.	Akufunekanga sihambe ixesha elide.
I know what exactly.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
Talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe mva.
The hat looks really nice though.	Umnqwazi ubonakala ulungile ngokwenene nangona kunjalo.
When he certainly did not.	Xa ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
He thought he knew how, exactly.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi njani, kanye.
The only problem is this.	Ingxaki kuphela yile.
I mean, it will have to.	Ndiya kuthetha, kuya kufuneka.
Really, really good work.	Ngokwenene, umsebenzi omhle ngokwenene.
And he would never do that.	Kwaye akanakuze enze njalo.
I love a good book.	Ndiyayithanda incwadi entle.
Very much, though.	Kakhulu, nokuba.
Not that he agreed with it.	Akunjalo ukuba wavuma kuyo.
I will find that way.	Ndiza kufumana loo ndlela.
I thought we did a good job at it.	Ndandicinga ukuba senze umsebenzi omhle ngaloo nto.
At first, it will certainly be difficult.	Ekuqaleni, ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba nzima.
Also, if you like it, tell someone else about it.	Kwakhona, ukuba uyayithanda, xelela omnye umntu ngayo.
Nothing out.	Akukho nto ngaphandle.
Very clearly.	Ngokucacileyo kakhulu.
So much for real.	Kakhulu kunjalo ngokwenene.
Not at all, of course.	Akunjalo kuyo yonke into, kunjalo.
No one should do it alone.	Akukho mntu kufuneka ayenze yedwa.
I could not stay here.	Andikwazanga ukuhlala apha.
Very good performance.	Ukwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
And not for long.	Kwaye hayi ixesha elide.
Or nothing.	Okanye akukho nto.
But the house.	Kodwa indlu.
Yes, that would be even better.	Ewe, oko kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
I've been here every day.	Bendisoloko ndilapha yonke imihla.
I think coffee will do.	Ndicinga ukuba ikofu iya kwenza.
To meet it.	Ukudibana kuyo.
Then all this will start again.	Emva koko konke oku kuya kuqala kwakhona.
With all of it.	Ngayo yonke.
At the moment I do not remember the name.	Okwangoku andikhumbuli igama.
But this must be the case.	Kodwa oku kufuneka kube njalo.
This is hard to talk about.	Oku kunzima ukuthetha ngayo.
I have never heard anything so bad.	Andizange ndive into embi ngolu hlobo.
He never read anything again.	Akazange aphinde afunde nantoni na.
We will get our money.	Siza kufumana imali yethu.
But you know very well.	Kodwa wazi kakuhle kakhulu.
The woman finally came down.	Wehla umfazi ekugqibeleni.
She is currently working from home.	Okwangoku usebenza ekhaya.
He also agreed.	Kwakhona wavuma.
He felt like he had to say something else.	Waziva ngathi kufuneka athethe enye into.
Thank you every day.	Enkosi ngayo yonke imihla.
We know very well about it.	Siyazi kakuhle ngayo.
It could only be him.	Inokuba ngaye kuphela.
Talk to you soon .	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala .
And don't go out of your way alone.	Kwaye musa ukuphuma ngendlela wedwa.
You know how it goes though.	Uyazi ukuba kuhamba njani kodwa.
You can do that well.	Ungayenza loo nto kakuhle.
There you are, the truth.	Nantso ke, inyaniso.
Look at my children.	Jonga abantwana bam.
But you can't stay.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala.
Not so much, not that right.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi ukuba kulungile.
He is not far away.	Akayi kude.
I won't be too hard on you.	Andiyi kuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
She's scared today.	Uyoyika namhlanje.
I hope you mean something else.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uthetha enye into.
He can speak, speak, speak.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha, ukuthetha, ukuthetha.
But he finally arrived.	Kodwa wafika ekugqibeleni.
He wants to stay.	Uyafuna ukuhlala.
But he is really good.	Kodwa ulungile ngokwenene.
But he does not want to be here.	Kodwa akafuni ukuba lapha.
He did not appear at work today.	Khange abonakale emsebenzini namhlanje.
He agreed.	Wavuma ke naye.
There was no reason for me to do that job.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba ndenze loo msebenzi.
It should be painful.	Kufuneka kube buhlungu.
I don't know how you got there.	Andazi ukuba ufike njani apho.
I certainly could not find anyone else.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andikwazanga ukufumana omnye umntu.
Lots of thinking.	Ukucinga okuninzi.
These only.	Ezi kuphela .
He thought he looked strange.	Wayecinga ukuba ukhangeleka engaqhelekanga.
He didn’t do a very new job this time.	Akazange enze umsebenzi omtsha kakhulu ngeli xesha.
Later, perhaps, when he is alone.	Kamva, mhlawumbi, xa eyedwa.
However, this is not mandatory.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunyanzelekanga.
He won't want you to do that.	Akayi kufuna ukuba wenze loo nto.
Someone else should have known that.	Omnye umntu bekufanele ukuba uyazi loo nto.
No one knew what had happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
In the end it is not high.	Ekugqibeleni akukho phezulu.
I'm sure it will happen the other way around.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
Then we will do it all again.	Emva koko siya kuyenza yonke kwakhona.
And that's just the way it is.	Kwaye kunjalo nje.
It will be as if it never existed.	Kuya kuba ngathi akuzange kube khona.
I can't afford a new car.	Andikwazi ukuthenga imoto entsha.
He would leave immediately.	Wayeza kuhamba ngoko nangoko.
But how exactly ?.	Kodwa njani kanye?.
He looked at everyone, and walked out.	Wajonga wonke umntu, waphuma.
He thought that was a good thing.	Wayecinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
He is waiting for you.	Ulinde wena.
And something very unusual happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
He thought all week.	Wacinga iveki yonke.
You want to, too.	Uyafuna, nawe.
You want to win, and you want to play early.	Ufuna ukuphumelela, kwaye ufuna ukudlala kwangethuba.
He did not speak for himself.	Khange athethe ngokwakhe.
I knew what it would be like.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
And maybe you should.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kufuneka.
I can tell that it is.	Ndiyakwazi ukuxelela ukuba kunjalo.
I did not want to know.	Bendingafuni andazi.
Not really, but really.	Akunjalo, kodwa ngokwenene.
They go where there is money.	Baya apho kukho imali.
However, there was no such thing.	Nangona kunjalo, kwakungekho nto enjalo.
The answer is, probably.	Impendulo kukuba, mhlawumbi.
I did everything wrong.	Ndenze yonke into engalunganga.
Well done.	Uhambe kakuhle ke.
He does not want to be alone.	Akafuni ukuba yedwa.
This is just a job.	Lo ngumsebenzi nje.
So he went on.	Ngoko waqhubeka.
It can be strange.	Inokuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
How can he do that to her.	Angayenza njani lonto kuye.
Please do the right thing.	Nceda wenze into elungileyo.
But my wife died.	Kodwa umfazi wam wafa.
You know you have a place to stay.	Uyazi ukuba unayo indawo yokuhlala.
Then he mentioned his name.	Emva koko wathetha igama lakhe.
I trust everyone.	Ndiyathemba wonke umntu.
He needed help to do it perfectly.	Wayefuna uncedo ukuze ayenze ngokupheleleyo.
Your message must be timely.	Umyalezo wakho kufuneka ufike ngexesha.
Either that or nothing.	Kunokuba yiloo nto okanye akukho nto.
And so, sorry.	Kwaye ke, uxolo.
I personally do not want to do that.	Mna ngokwam andifuni kuyenza loo nto.
Obviously this is the case.	Ngokucacileyo oku kunjalo.
He thought he was a great man.	Wayecinga ukuba yindoda enkulu.
But it is also painful.	Kodwa kwakhona buhlungu.
Maybe it's okay with me.	Mhlawumbi kulungile nam.
Come a little bit.	Weza kancinci.
But a woman is better.	Kodwa umfazi ungcono.
In the hospital, of course.	Esibhedlele, kunjalo.
I shouldn’t be angry about it, though.	Akufunekanga ndibe nomsindo ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
And so he said yes.	Kwaye ngoko uthe ewe.
I know little about him.	Ndiyazi kancinci ngaye.
Learning about it will not do it.	Ukufunda ngayo akuyi kuyenza.
Don't try hard enough.	Musa ukuzama ngokwaneleyo.
I don't know what to do about it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto.
I want to do some things.	Ndifuna ukwenza ezinye izinto.
You learn fast and work hard.	Ufunda ngokukhawuleza kwaye usebenza nzima.
Then you need to know what it is.	Emva koko kufuneka uyazi ukuba yintoni.
I want to stay with you, tonight.	Ndifuna ukuhlala nawe, ngokuhlwanje.
Long before that.	Kudala ngaphambi koko.
It seems obvious.	Kubonakala ngathi kucacile.
You play wherever you want.	Udlala apho ufuna khona.
Please check back later.	Nceda ujonge kamva.
I think it is absolutely fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle ngokupheleleyo.
And you want to know.	Kwaye ufuna ukwazi.
I do not care for strength.	Andikhathali ngamandla.
I've always thought about it.	Bendisoloko ndicinga ngayo.
And he never told anyone about it.	Kwaye akazange axelele mntu ngayo.
I did not mention this.	Khange ndithethe ngale nto.
Look no further.	Jonga phambili ngakumbi.
It became his job.	Waba ngumsebenzi wakhe.
I'm glad to read you did well.	Ndiyavuya ukufunda wenza kakuhle.
Now you have to do it.	Ngoku kufuneka wenze njalo.
Not good there.	Akukho kakuhle apho.
This is now impossible, if not impossible.	Oku ngoku akunakwenzeka, ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I wanted to get away from him.	Bendifuna kude kuye.
I tried to be with him.	Ndazama ukuba naye.
What exactly.	Yintoni ngokwenene.
A woman then.	Umfazi ngoko.
Finding accommodations will be very difficult.	Ukufumana indawo yokuhlala kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
You think you know everything is wrong.	Ucinga ukuba uyazi yonke into engalunganga.
You just want to be something.	Ufuna nje ukuba yinto.
It's a bad thing again.	Yinto embi kwakhona.
I will have to think long and hard about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ixesha elide kwaye nzima ngayo.
He settled down well.	Wahlala kakuhle.
I will have time.	Ndiza kuba nexesha.
He decided he would, and he opened the door.	Wagqiba kwelokuba iya kwenza, waza wavula ucango.
She looked at the flowers.	Wajonga iintyatyambo.
What a horrible place this place is.	Hayi indlela embi ngayo le ndawo.
You thought badly.	Ucinge kakubi.
But that seems to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala kunjalo nje.
I wanted to be there.	Ndandifuna ukuba lapho.
There is another way.	Kukho enye indlela.
I think everyone should do it once.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka ayenze kanye.
Nobody wanted to be there.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuba lapho.
Studying with him is fine.	Ukufunda naye kulungile.
No one will see.	Akukho mntu uza kubona.
Without maybe food.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi ukutya.
You always play with it.	Uhlala udlala ngayo.
Maybe it has happened.	Mhlawumbi kuye kwenzeka.
Everyone was wearing their coats.	Wonke umntu wayenxibe idyasi zakhe.
You probably know by now.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ngoku.
He could do something else.	Akwazi ukwenza enye into.
I always thought of my beautiful mother.	Bendisoloko ndicinga umama wam mhle.
Now that will be the future.	Ngoku oko kuya kuba phambili.
However, the picture is completely moving.	Nangona kunjalo, umfanekiso uhamba ngokupheleleyo.
That’s hard to do, after all.	Oko kunzima ukwenza, emva koko.
However, this is not the case at the moment.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo okwangoku.
You want to get out.	Ufuna ukuphuma ngaphandle.
Not just for a long time.	Hayi nje ixesha elide.
Everyone is waiting for you.	Wonke umntu ulinde wena.
He tried to speak he could not.	Wazama ukuthetha akakwazi.
He ate alone in a restaurant.	Watya yedwa kwindawo yokutyela.
I got to do some work.	Ndifike ndenze umsebenzi.
As did the woman.	Njengoko kwenza umfazi.
Before you arrive.	Ngaphambi kokuba ufike.
And no problem.	Kwaye akukho ngxaki.
You know it well, it doesn't.	Ukwazi kakuhle, akunjalo.
It will be good to make friends.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba wenze abahlobo.
You are doing well here.	Uqhuba kakuhle apha.
And there.	Kwaye phaya.
And none of us are alone.	Kwaye akukho namnye kuthi yedwa.
Now you also want money.	Ngoku nawe ufuna imali.
However, it is.	Nangona kunjalo, yinto.
I know .	Ndiyazi .
He wanted his thing.	Wayefuna into yakhe.
Maybe it will take all day.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuthatha imini yonke.
So in your time.	Ngoko ngexesha lakho.
But before that.	Kodwa ngaphambi koko.
He just doesn’t want to work so hard.	Akafuni nje ukusebenza nzima kangako.
He likes to be alone doing his job.	Uthanda ukuba yedwa esenza umsebenzi wakhe.
That is good.	Ukuba kuhle.
That was really fun.	Oko kube mnandi ngokwenene.
I really know this.	Ndiyazi ngokwenene oku.
I can't think of any better way.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngenye indlela engcono.
I’m not entirely sure where to look.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba ndijonge phi.
He did just that.	Wayenza ngolu hlobo nje.
Please join us for more success.	Nceda ube nathi ukuze uphumelele ngakumbi.
He told me before you came to town.	Wandixelela phambi kokuba uze edolophini.
And your children too.	Kwaye nabantwana bakho.
Ok thanks.	Kulungile Enkosi.
I know my father now.	Ndiyamazi utata wam ngoku.
Okay, but just in a way.	Kulungile, kodwa ngendlela nje.
I can walk there.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba apho.
You will not be able to see anyone except one.	Awuyi kukwazi ukubona nabani na ngaphandle komnye.
My mother may be sitting there one day.	Umama usenokuba uhleli apho ngenye imini.
Others he was able to control.	Abanye wakwazi ukuzibamba.
Man alone in the beginning is nothing.	Umntu yedwa ekuqaleni akukho nto.
But that is so now, and right now.	Kodwa oko kunjalo ngoku, kwaye kanye ngoku.
I can't live in it.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kuyo.
It looks like you've done something wrong.	Kubonakala ngathi wenze into engalunganga.
They did not, however.	Abazange, nangona kunjalo.
There seems to be no one inside.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho mntu ngaphakathi.
Not monkeys.	Hayi nyani .
Up or out.	Phezulu okanye ngaphandle.
Where there is a problem.	Apho kukho ingxaki.
Well, there you have it.	Ewe, nantso unayo.
There are times but not all the time.	Kukho amaxesha kodwa hayi lonke ixesha.
I will not say another word.	Andiyi kuthetha elinye igama.
Now, that's true.	Ngoku, yinyani leyo.
And he is really here.	Kwaye ulapha ngenene.
That's really old.	Yinto endala ngokwenene leyo.
There must have been an error before.	Kumele ukuba kukho impazamo ngaphambili.
He thought that would happen.	Wayecinga ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
Many will, many.	Abaninzi baya kwenza, abaninzi.
However it takes a long time.	Nangona kunjalo kuthatha ixesha elide.
You need help.	Nguwe ofuna uncedo.
And not just for me.	Kwaye hayi kum kuphela.
I wonder who is better.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani ongcono.
No this, not now.	Hayi le, hayi ngoku.
There he lived for the rest of his life.	Apho wahlala ubomi bakhe bonke.
I just arrived in the morning.	Ndifike nje ekuseni.
I can't talk like this.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngolu hlobo.
Everyone but.	Wonke umntu kodwa.
I'm not far away.	Andikho kude.
He doesn't think he can do it.	Akacingi ukuba angayenza.
Now, he can't play at all.	Ngoku, akakwazi kwaphela ukudlala.
To him.	Kuye .
My mother has seen a doctor since.	Umama uye wabona ugqirha emva koko.
Everything is very good and good.	Konke kuhle kakhulu kwaye kulungile.
I could not take a chance.	Andikwazanga ukuthatha ithuba.
However, one has to make a decision.	Kodwa ke, umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I think you know who this is.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba ngubani lo.
Not so much.	Akunjalo kangako.
He walks, at last.	Uhamba, ekugqibeleni.
Yes, very much indeed.	Ewe, kakhulu ngokwenene.
Please help !.	Nceda nceda!.
It seemed like everyone knew.	Kwakubonakala ngathi wonke umntu uyazi.
I have never read anything before.	Andizange ndifunde nantoni na ngaphambili.
You know you're looking there.	Uyazi ukuba ujonge apho.
And just like you.	Kwaye njengawe.
So, do not make a mistake.	Ngoko, musa ukwenza impazamo.
He decided to go inside.	Wagqiba ekubeni angene.
The same is true everywhere.	Kunjalo kuyo yonke indawo.
My father is not with her.	Utata akakho kuye.
And not too far away.	Kwaye akukho kude kakhulu.
And it's all because of us.	Kwaye konke ngenxa yethu.
This creates a lot of money.	Oku kudala imali eninzi.
And then, he heard a voice.	Kwaye ngoko, weva ilizwi.
It’s all about time though.	Konke malunga nexesha nangona.
I will not go.	Andiyi kuya.
He can see many things.	Uyakwazi ukubona izinto ezininzi.
No one is looking his way.	Akukho mntu ujonge indlela yakhe.
He obviously did not want to do that.	Ngokucacileyo wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
He looks very good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle kakhulu.
Almost to him.	Phantse kuye.
I want to go, everywhere.	Ndifuna ukuhamba, yonke indawo.
Yes, it will be really good.	Ewe, kuya kuba kuhle ngenene.
And he was doing well, too.	Kwaye wayenza kakuhle, naye.
Maybe anyway.	Mhlawumbi nangona kunjalo .
Please come here.	Ndicela uze apha.
Everyone certainly has something.	Wonke umntu ngokuqinisekileyo unayo nantoni na.
And we have done very well in doing all that.	Kwaye senze kakuhle kakhulu ekwenzeni yonke loo nto.
He told me more about it.	Undixelele ngakumbi ngaloo nto.
After all, you can't.	Emva koko, awukwazi.
He always is.	Uhlala enjalo.
But here we are all.	Kodwa apha sonke.
He has been.	Ukhe waba khona.
Only a night or two.	Kuphela ubusuku okanye ezimbini.
He did not succeed.	Zange aphumelele.
Not now, and ever.	Hayi ngoku, kwaye nanini na.
There was no one in him.	Kwakungekho namnye kuye.
He would try to talk.	Wayeza kuzama ukuthetha.
Whether you know it, or not.	Ukuba uyayazi, okanye hayi.
Yes, this can be painful.	Ewe, oku kunokuba buhlungu.
He asked for more time to make his decision.	Wacela ixesha elingakumbi ukuze enze isigqibo sakhe.
I have to be me.	Kufuneka ndibe ndim.
It takes someone to know one.	Kuthatha umntu ukuba azi enye.
Bad dog again.	Inja embi kwakhona.
But you are a new person.	Kodwa ungumntu omtsha.
What happened to him ?.	Kwenzeka ntoni kuye?.
We'll see how strange it is.	Siza kubona indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo.
I'm not sure what you think.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I've always thought about that.	Bendisoloko ndicinga ngaloo nto.
Tell me that again.	Ndixelele lonto kwakhona .
Tell me what to do now.	Ndixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni ngoku.
And that would not be good.	Kwaye oko akuyi kuba kuhle.
You just want to be a player, okay.	Ufuna ukuba ngumdlali nje, kulungile.
Not after that.	Hayi emva koko.
If you need help, you will come to me.	Ukuba ufuna uncedo, uya kuza kum.
He did not want to think otherwise.	Wayengafuni ukucinga ngenye indlela.
So that's not what happened.	Ngoko ayisiyiyo into eyenzekayo.
I am not at all.	Andikho kwaphela.
We are not going anywhere with this.	Asiyi ndawo ngale nto.
You don't have to look at me like that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ujonge kum ngolo hlobo.
He speaks clearly to everyone.	Uthetha ngokucacileyo kuye wonke umntu.
He never thought about it.	Akazange acinge ngayo.
In all of this he did not succeed.	Kuyo yonke le nto akazange aphumelele.
The error can be very high.	Impazamo ingaba phezulu kakhulu.
He went where the people were.	Waya apho kukho abantu.
He said something alone.	Wathetha into eyedwa.
And what will happen to him.	Kwaye kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuye .
Yes, almost every day.	Ewe, phantse yonke imihla.
I like it there.	Ndiyayithanda ke apho.
He knew his mother loved him.	Wayesazi ukuba umama wakhe uyamthanda.
he did well.	wenza kakuhle.
And if you want something done, it's done.	Kwaye ukuba ufuna into yenziwe, yenziwe.
It would be nice if you could be there.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba unokuba khona.
No, it's just fine.	Hayi, ilungile kuphela.
It's just done.	Yenziwe nje loo nto.
There is something about him.	Kukho into ngaye.
To get .	Ukufumana .
Look at that.	Jonga oko.
He didn't want to say anything.	Wayengafuni kuthetha nto.
Some people .	Abanye abantu .
But this time.	Kodwa ngeli xesha .
I did not see my wife all day.	Zange ndimbone umfazi wam imini yonke.
And, maybe, that's a good thing.	Kwaye, mhlawumbi, yinto entle.
Good to try though.	Kuhle ukuzama kodwa.
She just wants to see her children.	Ufuna nje ukubona abantwana bakhe.
Or coat.	Okanye idyasi.
He looked down very wide.	Wajonga phantsi kakhulu.
The gun stays here.	Umpu uhlala apha.
Doing so will be difficult.	Ukwenza oko kuya kuba nzima.
Sorry this morning.	Uxolo ngale ntsasa.
It seemed like he wanted to play.	Kwakubonakala ngathi ufuna ukudlala.
And it could be exactly the same thing.	Kwaye inokuba yinto enye ngokupheleleyo.
That seems possible.	Oko kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
And some money.	Kwaye enye imali.
Or anyone really.	Okanye nabani na ngokwenene.
Later, back.	Kamva, emva .
Tell me what it is.	Ndixelele ukuba yintoni na.
He said anytime.	Wathi nanini na.
Until next time !.	Kude kube lixesha elizayo!.
That means, nothing, really.	Oko kuthetha ukuba, akukho nto, ngokwenene.
It's good for me.	Ilungile kum.
I have to go to class.	Kufuneka ndiye eklasini.
And she is incredibly beautiful.	Kwaye mhle ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
Therefore, it is difficult to say.	Ngoko ke, kunzima ukuthetha.
He did not ask any questions.	Zange wabuza nayiphi na imibuzo.
Now he would know.	Ngoku wayeza kukwazi.
This is a good idea, but there is a problem.	Licebo elihle, kodwa kukho ingxaki.
You will buy almost everything.	Uya kuthenga phantse yonke into.
Tom felt he had to say something.	UTom waziva kufuneka athethe into.
I have to look.	Kufuneka ndijonge.
I do not clearly understand.	Andiqondi ngokucacileyo.
If not, you need to do so.	Ukuba akunjalo, kufuneka wenze njalo.
My mother thought it was a joke.	Umama wayecinga ukuba asiyonto yokudlala.
Although there is one problem.	Nangona kukho ingxaki enye.
Good job though.	Umsebenzi omhle nangona.
I saw better.	Ndabona kungcono.
And it's really good.	Kwaye kulungile ngokwenene.
But it may not be.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba akunjalo.
And this can be in anything you want to do.	Kwaye oku kunokuba kuyo nantoni na ofuna ukuyenza.
And yet, nothing.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akukho nto.
I want you here, by my side.	Ndifuna wena apha, ecaleni kwam.
I would like to think about it.	Ndingathanda ukucinga ngayo.
But others.	Kodwa abanye .
What is so bad about him? 	Yintoni embi kangaka ngaye?
Days, weeks immediately after that.	Iintsuku, iiveki ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
He did his thing.	Wenze into yakhe.
But he knew that he would never do that.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
He just went to work.	Wahamba nje waya emsebenzini.
My mother looked at me.	Umama ujonge kum.
That always takes a lot of time.	Oko kuhlala kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
I learned more about it.	Ndifunde ngakumbi ngayo.
If not, you will be wasting your time.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kuba udlala ngexesha lakho.
That's what a friend does.	Yiloo nto eyenziwa ngumhlobo.
But it's just me.	Kodwa yinto nje kum.
But there is no need.	Kodwa akukho mfuneko.
And yes, of course.	Kwaye ewe, kunjalo.
I'm sorry about him.	Ndiyaxolisa ngaye.
I'm no more.	Andikho ngakumbi.
Just at the moment of anger, he thought.	Kanye ngexesha lokuba nomsindo, wacinga.
Not to him, but to himself.	Hayi kuye, kodwa kuye ngokwakhe.
I think he probably knew.	Ndicinga ukuba mhlawumbi wayesazi.
Maybe he said to her.	Mhlawumbi wathi kuye.
Or so.	Okanye kunjalo.
Don't just talk.	Musa ukuba uthethe nje.
He may be lying in bed.	Inokuba ulele ebhedini.
I don't know where the problem is.	Andazi ukuba iphi ingxaki.
Yes we want the police.	Ewe sifuna amapolisa.
Just let him know.	Nje ukuba azi.
I'll wait and see.	Ndilinde ndilinde.
Sorry, now.	Uxolo, ngoku.
Well, you can't do that now.	Ewe, awukwazi ukwenza nayiphi na loo nto ngoku.
My mother was very thoughtful.	Umama wayecinga kakhulu.
Everyone knows all this.	Wonke umntu uyayazi yonke le nto.
I did not come for long.	Andizange ndifike ixesha elide.
Or, he knew.	Okanye, wayesazi.
Not this.	Hayi le .
This should not be difficult.	Oku akufanele kube nzima.
Maybe next week, just to see how it goes.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo, ukubona nje ukuba kuhamba njani.
I think he wanted to see what would happen.	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna ukubona ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Doing it again.	Ukwenza kwakhona.
He apologized.	Wacela uxolo.
He came to my class.	Weza eklasini yam.
He had never done it before.	Akazange enze ngaphambili.
He wanted to hurt her.	Wayefuna enze buhlungu.
He was very hard to find.	Waba nzima kakhulu ukufumana.
I know my mother.	Ndiyamazi umama wam.
It's all done internally.	Yonke yenziwe ngaphakathi.
Yes, all is well.	Ewe, konke kulungile.
But he never did and he never did and we never did.	Kodwa akazange ayenze kwaye akazange ayenze kwaye asizange senze.
My case, absolutely.	Ityala lam, ngokupheleleyo.
He must make the truth.	Kufuneka enze inyaniso.
I would definitely like to work on it though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingathanda ukusebenza kuyo nangona kunjalo.
A big old car.	Imoto endala enkulu.
Food in the house.	Ukutya endlini.
You didn't know anything about it last month.	Ubungazi kwanto ngale nto kwinyanga ephelileyo.
That is difficult at first.	Oko kunzima ekuqaleni.
I want something better.	Ndifuna into entle ngakumbi.
Maybe you just said you did.	Mhlawumbi uthe wenze nje.
But not in a bad way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela embi.
I arrived early, of course.	Ndifike kwangoko, kunjalo.
A very small window.	Ifestile encinci kakhulu.
You're curious, you know.	Unomdla, uyazi.
Tomorrow.	Kusasa.
What a new one.	Yintoni enye entsha.
I personally do not want to wait for that.	Nam ngokwam andifuni kulinda kuloo nto.
I don't have to be in it myself.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ndibe kuyo mna.
The big problem now for you.	Ingxaki enkulu ngoku kuwe.
Not a small answer.	Hayi impendulo encinci.
I know everything.	Ndiyazi yonke into.
One is the first teacher.	Omnye ngutitshala wokuqala.
This is good though.	Oku kuhle nangona kunjalo.
Not always.	Akukho rhoqo.
He wanted to retire.	Wayefuna ukuthatha umhlala-phantsi.
But it takes time.	Kodwa kufuna ixesha.
Play will continue.	Ukudlala kuya kuqhubeka.
I like something new.	Ndiyayithanda into entsha.
This time he should come to you.	Ngeli xesha kufuneka eze kuwe.
You do not have to bring it.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uze nayo.
He walks behind me again.	Aphinde ahambe emva kwam.
His mother looked up.	Umama wakhe wajonga.
I don’t see this as the case, though.	Andiboni ukuba oku kunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
I heard the same thing.	Ndeva into enye.
He says he is not.	Uthi akakho.
He expects her to say something.	Ulindele ukuba athethe into.
No one brought it.	Akukho mntu uze naye.
But he is trying very hard.	Kodwa uzama kakhulu.
That no one should know.	Oko kwakungekho mntu kufuneka uyazi.
I think he is interested, too.	Ndicinga ukuba unomdla, naye.
You should, too.	Ufanele, nawe.
He would do it then.	Wayeza kuyenza ngoko.
Or that.	Okanye ukuba .
And great, too.	Kwaye enkulu, nayo.
What should be the reason.	Kufuneka sibe yintoni isizathu.
You will have to stay here, but not for long.	Kuya kufuneka uhlale apha, kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
Well, not yet.	Ke, hayi okwangoku.
There was nothing, he concluded.	Kwakungekho nto, wagqiba.
But so is the same mistake.	Kodwa kunjalo impazamo efanayo.
It's hard to stop.	Kunzima ukuyeka.
Another good way.	Enye indlela elungileyo.
I can't stop walking.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukuhamba.
You will not be with him.	Akuyi kuba naye.
He came to our bedroom.	Weza kwigumbi lethu lokulala.
I just went.	Ndaya nje.
You talk about this a lot.	Uthetha ngale nto kakhulu.
Tomorrow is good for me.	Ngomso kulungile kum.
How do you mean? 	Uthetha njani?
Stop being angry.	Yeka ukuba nomsindo.
thinking about you.	ndicinga ngawe.
Right there at home.	Kanye apho ekhaya.
I'm happy to play under him.	Ndiyavuya ukudlala phantsi kwakhe.
It will be easier to do now.	Kuya kuba lula ukwenza ngoku.
But there is a problem anyway.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki nangona kunjalo.
There is something strange here.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga apha.
Getting to where you are going.	Ukuya apho ukuya khona.
Now she can't speak.	Ngoku akakwazi kuthetha.
It happens but not always.	Kwenzeka kodwa hayi rhoqo.
For both of us, you and me.	Kuthi sobabini, mna nawe sobabini.
What to do? 	Ukwenza ntoni?
And he felt it.	Kwaye waziva .
Otherwise there was nothing.	Ngaphandle koko kwakungekho nto.
No one ever imagined what would happen next.	Akukho mntu wakha wacinga ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Or no, it's not.	Okanye hayi, akunjalo.
Everyone thinks his way is right.	Wonke umntu ucinga ukuba indlela yakhe ilungile.
Speaking.	Ethetha .
You've done enough here.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo apha.
Then we will both return.	Emva koko siya kubuya sobabini.
And look into his eyes.	Kwaye jonga amehlo akhe.
I thought you were here.	Bendicinga ukuba ulapha.
We know that there is death.	Siyazi ukuba kukho ukufa.
We will all be.	Sonke siya kuba.
You stay late, late, late.	Uhlala emva kwexesha, emva kwexesha, emva kwexesha.
I'm a woman too.	Nam umfazi.
He had to win.	Kwafuneka aphumelele.
I'm not in your car.	Andikho emotweni yakho.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka uze.
You have tried.	Uye wazama.
He would go.	Wayeza kuya.
I knew someone was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho umntu oza kuza.
Nothing much, perhaps.	Akukho nto ingako, mhlawumbi.
But here, there was nobody there.	Kodwa apha, kwakungekho mntu.
Fast forward.	Ngokukhawuleza phambili.
I'm trying to control myself.	Ndizama ukuzibamba.
Yes, forgiveness is power.	Ewe, uxolo ngamandla.
I want you to succeed.	Ndifuna uphumelele.
Here and there everywhere.	Apha apho kwaye yonke indawo.
I know nothing about it, really.	Andazi nto ngayo, ngokwenene.
I had to go to the hospital.	Kwafuneka ndiye esibhedlele.
This seems to me even more possible.	Oku kubonakala kum kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
Well, I wanted to meet you.	Kulungile, bendifuna ukudibana nawe.
Slowly and much.	Kancinci uye kakhulu.
Nice place, right where we want to live.	Indawo entle, kanye apho sifuna ukuhlala khona.
He can't stop thinking.	Akakwazi ukuyeka ukucinga.
You can’t think of anything, really.	Awukwazi ukucinga nantoni na, ngokwenene.
Not in it.	Hayi kuyo.
He just wants you to know.	Ufuna nje ukuba wazi.
And they will talk to you.	Kwaye baya kuthetha nawe.
The ball goes backwards.	Ibhola iya ngasemva.
Do not say this to me.	Musa ukuyithetha le nto kum.
And it will be fun.	Kwaye kuya kuba mnandi.
That never happened, of course.	Oko akuzange kwenzeke, kunjalo.
But he did not say that.	Kodwa akazange athethe loo nto.
That happened and it happened so fast.	Oko kwenzeka kwaye kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
I'll start one way.	Ndiza kuqala ngendlela enye.
That certainly is not the case today.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo namhlanje.
We will see if this is the case.	Siza kubona ukuba oku kunjalo.
We will be like him.	Siya kuba njalo naye.
I'm sure you will find something.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kufumana into.
I know a thing or two.	Ndiyazi into okanye ezimbini.
But that is still the case.	Kodwa kunjalo nangoku.
You know that too.	Nawe uyayazi loo nto.
I hope he doesn't go.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akayi.
That or it was not time.	Oko okanye kwakungekho xesha.
Well, maybe that only happened in my house.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi oko kwenzeka kuphela endlwini yam.
I want to tell you about it.	Ndifuna ukukuxelela ngayo.
I'll take the letter.	Ndiza kuthatha ileta.
Nothing small.	Akukho nto encinci.
How will we continue with our money ?.	Siza kuqhubeka njani ngemali yethu?.
But this can be fun.	Kodwa oku kunokuba mnandi.
I did not know where.	Ndandingazi ndawo.
I will leave immediately.	Ndiza kuhamba ngoko nangoko.
I don't like that.	Andiyithandi into yokuba.
The answer is no reason at all.	Impendulo akukho sizathu konke konke.
I thought it was him.	Bendicinga ukuba nguye .
I haven’t done anything, though.	Andizange ndenze nantoni na, nangona kunjalo.
That's really all.	Yiloo nto yonke ngokwenene.
I don't remember much either.	Nam andikhumbuli kakhulu.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, kunjalo nje.
Look at the mistakes.	Jonga iimpazamo.
He did not know how to go about it.	Wayengazi ukuba ahambe njani.
If you know the best way, please let me know.	Ukuba uyazi indlela engcono, nceda undixelele.
Then he said no.	Emva koko wathi hayi.
Yes, there is such a place.	Ewe, kukho indawo enjalo.
He does but.	Uyayenza kodwa.
And he never showed up.	Kwaye akazange abonakale.
He never told her.	Akazange amxelele.
So he tried to think.	Ngoko wazama ukucinga.
I don't believe there is.	Andikholelwa ukuba kukho.
But not for him, he realized soon.	Kodwa hayi kuye, waqonda kungekudala.
I wonder who he is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani.
Then go once.	Uze uhambe kanye.
Sorry about that and thank you !.	Uxolo ngaloo nto kwaye enkosi!.
At the top, the work will proceed faster.	Phezulu, umsebenzi uya kuqhubeka ngokukhawuleza.
It's great to have you here.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba nawe apha.
He agreed to everything.	Wavuma kuyo yonke into.
So what did he do? 	Wenze ntoni ke?
She was scared, because of him.	Wayesoyika, ngenxa yakhe.
Just all this.	Yonke nje le nto.
But first, the question.	Kodwa kuqala, umbuzo.
Too slow.	Ukuhamba kancinci kakhulu.
All the time, people.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, abantu.
He will go there immediately.	Uza kuya khona kwangoko.
Thanks for all the feedback.	Enkosi ngayo yonke impendulo.
He took everything.	Wathatha yonke into.
And maybe that's okay.	Kwaye mhlawumbi oko kulungile.
I could not find his name.	Andikwazanga ukufumana igama lakhe.
You seem to be feeling much better.	Kubonakala ngathi uziva ngcono kakhulu.
It certainly seemed that way at the time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakubonakala ngathi kunjalo ngelo xesha.
I would like to restrain myself.	Ndingathanda ukuzibamba.
I forgot to go with you this morning for this.	Ndilibele ukuhamba nawe ngale ntsasa ngale nto.
Please talk to me.	Nceda uthethe nam.
She sits down on the bed.	Uhlala phantsi ebhedini.
Other than that, not much.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho kakhulu.
You are more like me than you think.	Ufana nam ngaphezu kokuba ucinga.
Just a little bit, a little bit.	Kancinci nje, kancinci kancinci.
This is not the case here.	Apha akunjalo.
No money .	Akukho mali .
No one seems to know anything about it.	Akukho mntu ubonakala ngathi wazi nto ngayo.
We'll be down soon.	Siza kuba phantsi kungekudala.
He did it a little bit.	Uye wayenza kancinci.
You think of me.	Ucinga ngam.
Do not stop walking.	Musa ukuyeka ukuhamba.
I'll get it in my office.	Ndiza kufumana eofisini yam.
She is sitting there.	Uhleli apho.
A nice, nice house.	Indlu encinci, entle.
I myself have one.	Mna ngokwam enye.
But then.	Kodwa emva koko.
You have to do that a lot.	Kufuneka wenze oko kakhulu.
I wanted him to go to prison.	Ndandifuna aye entolongweni.
That way, he felt strange.	Ngelo hlobo, waziva engaqhelekanga.
Thank you thank you thank you !!!!.	Enkosi enkosi enkosi enkosi!!!!.
Very nice way, absolutely.	Indlela entle kakhulu, ngokupheleleyo.
He went a week.	Wahamba iveki.
He wants to retire.	Ufuna ukuthatha umhlala-phantsi.
Or a girl.	Okanye intombi.
Look up here.	Jonga apha phezulu.
Definitely and definitely.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo.
I wish you more money.	Ndinqwenela ukuba imali eninzi.
Two hours there.	Iiyure ezimbini apho.
Few things, really.	Izinto ezimbalwa, ngokwenene.
He had better leave.	Kungcono ukuba ahambe.
Because it is impossible.	Kuba akunakwenzeka.
I better do it myself.	Kungcono ndiyenze ngokwam.
Maybe something better.	Mhlawumbi into engcono.
I'm sure .	Ndiqinisekile .
Then he made mistakes.	Emva koko wenza iimpazamo.
Look at your picture.	Jonga umfanekiso wakho.
But in the end, he did not succeed.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, akazange aphumelele.
Where is this .	Iphi lento .
There was nothing else to do or try.	Kwakungekho enye into yokwenza okanye ukuzama.
He will stay here, with me.	Uya kuhlala apha, kunye nam.
That's what it is.	Nguye lo nto.
This makes our job easier.	Oku kwenza umsebenzi wethu ube lula.
But, no, it is not.	Kodwa, hayi, akunjalo.
I knew it would be so.	Bendisazi ukuba uya kuba njalo.
Certainly not his money.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi imali yakhe.
There was nothing behind it.	Kwakungekho nto ngasemva.
To put it bluntly.	Ukuthetha ngokucacileyo kunjalo.
One says one thing, another says another.	Omnye uthetha enye into, omnye athethe enye.
I thought you would succeed.	Bendicinga ukuba uya kuphumelela.
Something else happened.	Kwenzeka enye into.
And you always are.	Kwaye uhlale unjalo.
If you like, it will be.	Ukuba uyathanda, kuya kuba njalo.
And he won't do that.	Kwaye akayi kuyenza loo nto.
But then it happened again.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka kwakhona.
You can be.	Unokuba njalo.
Look at everything that happens.	Jonga yonke into eyenzekayo.
This is nothing more than that.	Oku akukho nto ngaphezu koko.
He went in with her.	Wangena naye.
Now look back at all of that.	Ngoku jonga emva kuyo yonke loo nto.
Well, one knows.	Ewe, umntu uyazi.
I just want to try it once.	Ndifuna nje ukuzama kube kanye.
And if not, what will happen.	Kwaye ukuba akunjalo, kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
And a lot of space.	Kwaye indawo eninzi.
All about me.	Konke malunga nam.
I don't think you have to be that way.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka ube njalo.
I thought it was good for me.	Ndandicinga ukuba ilungile kum.
But now he knew something else.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi enye into.
He asked for another chance.	Wacela elinye ithuba.
He did what he did.	Uyenzile into ayenzileyo.
Or you ?.	Okanye wena?.
He is, but more so.	Nguye, kodwa ngakumbi.
It will happen, though.	Kuya kwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
That will do it.	Oko kuya kukwenza.
I don't know how you do it, really.	Andazi ukuba uyenza njani na, ngenene.
But he became very angry.	Kodwa waba nomsindo kakhulu.
You will find another way.	Uza kufumana enye indlela.
I know the truth now.	Ndiyazi inyani ngoku.
No no no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi .
Look forward to eating there again soon.	Jonga phambili ukutya apho kwakhona kungekudala.
You may be here with us.	Inokuba ulapha kunye nathi.
I never did it before, you know.	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili, uyazi.
Until then no one will tell him anything.	Kude kube ngoko akukho mntu uza kumxelela nto.
He really wanted to go.	Ngokwenene wayefuna ukuhamba.
Nobody likes me.	Akukho mntu uthanda mna.
Who makes money.	Ngubani owenza imali.
He lives with us.	Uhlala nathi.
Doing so did not happen to him.	Ukwenjenjalo akuzange kwenzeke kuye.
Certainly not to you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo kuwe.
Everything is very old.	Konke kudala kakhulu.
There is new money.	Kukho imali entsha.
He knew he was there.	Wayesazi ukuba ukhona.
He knew a lot about it.	Wayesazi kakhulu ngayo.
For a long time it is clear.	Lixesha elide kucacile.
He finally realized what he was going to do.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
And seeing a son will probably be very difficult.	Kwaye ukubona unyana mhlawumbi kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
This will require doing a lot.	Oku kuya kufuna ukwenza okuninzi.
He can't know you're here.	Akakwazi ukuba ulapha.
Yes, you did something wrong.	Ewe, wenze into engalunganga.
Not after that he knew now.	Hayi emva koko wayesazi ngoku.
Death to be with him.	Ukufa ukuba naye.
And it's harder than you know.	Kwaye kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba uyazi.
And he went into his room.	Wangena ke egumbini lakhe.
Well, before everyone else speaks.	Kulungile, ngaphambi kokuba wonke umntu athethe.
I want people.	Ndifuna abantu.
Not just people.	Hayi nje abantu.
You have to look at why.	Kufuneka ujonge ukuba kutheni.
It happens after you leave.	Kwenzeka emva kokuba uhambe.
I went upstairs.	Ndaya phezulu.
He, too, will never succeed.	Naye, akanakuze aphumelele.
At the time he was living.	Ngelo xesha wayehlala.
She wanted to stay with him.	Wayefuna ukuhlala naye.
You can not help us again.	Awunako ukusinceda kwakhona.
Everything was clear.	Konke kwakucacile.
I'm not going home.	Andiyi ekhaya.
I think he is really ready to die.	Ndicinga ukuba ukulungele ngokwenene ukufa.
Let me talk to you a little bit.	Makhe ndithethe nawe kancinci.
I think not at the moment.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo okwangoku.
I'm tired too.	Nam ndidiniwe.
I want to achieve this.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela le.
Or too high.	Okanye phezulu kakhulu.
It can be.	Inokuba khona.
So there.	Ngoko apho.
You will see that it is true.	Uya kubona ukuba yinyani.
I never saw one.	Andizange ndimbone omnye.
I wasn’t thinking very clearly, clearly.	Ndandingacingi ngokucacileyo, ngokucacileyo.
He can never succeed in time.	Akanakuze aphumelele ngexesha.
He went back to work, he told me.	Wabuyela emsebenzini, wandixelela.
He does not want anyone.	Akafuni mntu.
There are about.	Kukho malunga.
Trying to do many things at once.	Ukuzama ukwenza izinto ezininzi ngexesha elinye.
And this is really happening.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
In the end he said nothing.	Ekugqibeleni akazange athethe nto.
I can't talk enough about it !.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngayo!.
It doesn't have to be here.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba umntu ahlale apha.
Or like nothing.	Okanye ngathi akukho nto.
Being on time.	Ukuba ngexesha.
Until this week.	Kude kube yile veki.
I think this is a big job.	Ndicinga ukuba lo ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
In bed, of course.	Ebhedini, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I don't care what you read.	Andikhathali nokuba ufunda ntoni.
Look at me right.	Jonga kum kanye.
It will be a very new thing.	Iya kuba yinto entsha kakhulu.
If you have ever looked again.	Ukuba sele ukhe wajonga kwakhona.
This would be difficult.	Oku bekuya kuba nzima.
I wanted to stay here.	Bendifuna ukuhlala apha.
He is here alone.	Ulapha yedwa.
I definitely didn’t want to or do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni ukuba okanye ndiyenze.
I could not find a job.	Andikwazanga ukufumana umsebenzi.
I never heard of him.	Andizange ndive nto ngaye.
He is, however.	Unjalo, nangona kunjalo.
Maybe it will be one day.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba ngenye imini.
He wanted to do this as soon as possible.	Wayefuna ukwenza oku ngokukhawuleza.
Also, it is very well done.	Kwakhona, yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu.
But he sat down, a little bit.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi, kancinci.
He knew there was a gun.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho umpu.
Maybe this is you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe lo.
I am happy with the work.	Ndiyavuya ngomsebenzi.
He was not at the top of the job.	Wayengekho phezulu emsebenzini.
Reading is really hard.	Ukufunda nzima ngokwenene.
He finally went to his place.	Uye wagqiba waya kwindawo yakhe.
And you want to work with anyone.	Kwaye ufuna ukusebenza nabani.
I'm afraid .	Ndiyoyika .
He is always like that.	Uhleli enjalo.
Tell me .	Ndixelele .
He is not outside.	Akakho phandle.
Otherwise, it is not necessary.	Ngaphandle koko, akuyomfuneko.
At that point, you want to finish things.	Ngelo xesha, ufuna ukugqiba izinto.
The marriage did not work out.	Umtshato awuzange uphumelele.
I'm not sure why that happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni oko kwenzeka.
Finally he could not wait.	Ekugqibeleni akazange akwazi ukulinda.
They will rebuild her.	Baya kubuya bakhe kwakhona.
Then, you will get another one.	Emva koko, uya kufumana enye.
Since last week.	Ukusukela kwiveki ephelileyo.
Not many days, but some.	Hayi iintsuku ezininzi, kodwa ezinye.
Only for me.	Kuphela kum.
But now I look back on it.	Kodwa ngoku ndijonge emva kuyo.
Yes, my mother did not want me to leave.	Ewe, umama wayengafuni ukuba ndihambe.
This is being alone.	Oku kukuba wedwa.
I know all about him.	Ndiyazi konke ngaye.
I will not do this.	andiyi kuyenza le nto.
I wonder if he can speak.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha.
I did that though.	Ndenze ngolo hlobo kodwa.
You have done a very bad thing.	Wenze into embi kakhulu.
You really like it.	Ngokwenene uyayithanda.
I know we did.	Ndiyazi ukuba senze njalo.
I never felt that way.	Andizange ndive ngolo hlobo.
Although that is not possible, however.	Nangona oko akunakwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
You look good, you feel good.	Ukhangeleka ulungile, uziva ulungile.
I've been here ever since.	Ndilapha ukusukela oko.
He knows very well.	Uyakwazi kakhulu.
The doctor expects no danger.	Ugqirha ulindele ukuba akukho ngozi.
I know about it all.	Ndiyazi ngayo yonke loo nto.
But not so much now.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu ngoku.
He's got to be a great man, really.	Umele ukuba yindoda enkulu, ngokwenene.
But you will have to act fast.	Kodwa kuya kufuneka wenze ngokukhawuleza.
I wanted to see why.	Ndandifuna ukubona ukuba kutheni.
I decided to wait.	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndilinde.
He is just like everyone else in that sense.	Ufana naye wonke umntu ngaloo ndlela.
Work late at night.	Umsebenzi ebusuku kakhulu.
This seems difficult.	Oku kubonakala kunzima.
I learned a lot today.	Ndifunde okuninzi namhlanje.
He had not been in this place for a long time.	Wayengekho kule ndawo ixesha elide.
Don't go too far or do too much.	Musa ukuhamba kakhulu okanye wenze kakhulu.
One car inside, another car outside.	Imoto enye ngaphakathi, enye imoto ngaphandle.
Certainly, it could be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, inokuba njalo.
He went to prison and spent time.	Waya entolongweni waza wachitha ixesha.
She loves him so much, of course.	Uyamthanda kakhulu, kunjalo.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ncam ukuba kutheni.
I never did that at all.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto tu.
This is the thing.	Le yinto.
Well, everything is fine here.	Ewe, yonke into ilungile apha.
But, please tell me the time.	Kodwa, ndicela undixelele ixesha.
Now, he understood.	Ngoku, waqonda.
That's just a bad thing.	Yinto embi nje leyo.
Makhe,.	Makhe,.
But it will be a long time for you.	Kodwa kuya kuba lixesha elide kuwe.
I always stay.	Ndihlala ndihlala.
He did not eat enough.	Akazange atye ngokwaneleyo.
I always want to be human.	Ndihlala ndifuna ukuba ngumntu.
Yes, much better.	Ewe, ngcono kakhulu.
No, you can't get all that home.	Hayi, awukwazi ukufumana yonke loo nto ekhaya.
You go to him little by little.	Uya kuye kancinci kancinci.
To be too old for that.	Ukuba mdala kakhulu oko.
Then he went to look for food.	Emva koko waya kufuna ukutya.
Look at my life.	Jonga ubomi bam.
The meat is good.	Inyama ilungile.
You need time.	Ufuna ixesha .
They last a long time.	Bahlala ixesha elide.
He wanted children.	Wayefuna abantwana.
Nice to tell you.	Ndiyavuya ukukuxelela.
I certainly, if not.	Mna ngokuqinisekileyo, ukuba akunjalo.
I'm sure I won't do it.	Ndiqinisekile andisayi kuyenza.
He did nothing '.	Akazange enze nto'.
He may have died because of you.	Usenokuba wafa ngenxa yakho.
But it was not him.	Kodwa akuzange kube nguye.
Because it is me.	Kuba ndim.
no no.	hayi hayi.
Not very well, of course.	Hayi kakuhle kakhulu, kunjalo.
This is what you need to know.	Yile nto ekufuneka uyazi.
Why is that?.	Kutheni kunjalo?.
We will have no other choice.	Asiyi kuba nayo enye indlela.
And you know about us.	Kwaye uyazi ngathi.
Good to know about you.	Kuhle ukwazi ngawe.
I don't know why he thought that.	Andazi kwakutheni ukuze acinge oko.
I can't go with it.	Andikwazi ukuhamba nayo.
Coffee has already been made.	Ikofu sele yenziwe.
He travels a lot.	Uhamba kakhulu.
Everyone does it his own way.	Wonke umntu wenza ngendlela yakhe.
That means you.	Oko kuthetha wena.
And she is beautiful.	Kwaye mhle .
Eventually he tried another method.	Ekugqibeleni wazama enye indlela.
We'll take another one.	Siza kuthatha enye.
Nothing for us.	Akukho nto kuthi.
And he is.	Kwaye nguye.
At the moment, this is hard to achieve.	Okwangoku, oku kunzima ukuphumelela.
And yes he is.	Kwaye ewe unjalo.
It's there all the time.	Kukho ngalo lonke ixesha.
Well, that's my plan now.	Ke, licebo lam elo ngoku.
He resigned shortly thereafter.	Waphuma emsebenzini kungekudala emva koko.
Thanks again for all the help.	Enkosi kwakhona ngalo lonke uncedo.
It would be nice to have it.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba nayo.
So thank you for all your help.	Ngoko enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngokuba phambili ngolo hlobo.
I don't have time now.	Andinaxesha ngoku.
But this is nothing.	Kodwa oku akukho nto.
I went alone.	Ndihambe ndedwa.
Have you ever wondered about that?	Ngaba ukhe wazibuza ngaloo nto.
Very light.	Isibane kakhulu.
So he knew.	Ngoko wayesazi.
And he ate.	Kwaye wayedla.
And you might be right.	Kwaye unokuba ulungile.
Stop if something goes wrong.	Yeka ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
That will have to be later.	Oko kuya kufuneka kube kamva.
I hope everyone is fine.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu ulungile.
But, again, it’s your fault.	Kodwa, kwakhona, ityala lakho.
They will be, now.	Baya kuba, ngoku.
And this is certainly not possible.	Kwaye oku ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
It will be easier to do this.	Kuya kuba lula ukwenza oku.
Yeah, my one chance.	Ewe, ithuba lam elinye.
Finally, he looked back.	Ekugqibeleni, wajonga ngasemva.
And that, he did nothing.	Kwaye oko, akazange enze nto.
And you did a great good job.	Kwaye wenze umsebenzi omkhulu olungileyo.
We will try to do that.	Siza kuzama ukwenza oko.
Or it will be.	Okanye kuya kuba.
I want you to think of yourself and yourself.	Ndifuna ucinge ngawe nawe wedwa.
He works here.	Usebenza apha.
At the moment it is not possible.	Okwangoku akunakwenzeka.
It’s hard to do much better at home.	Kunzima ukwenza ngcono kakhulu ekhaya.
It is very difficult here.	Kunzima kakhulu apha.
I need help.	Ndifuna uncedo .
Nobody ever did that to him.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza loo nto kuye.
I have to go there then.	Kufuneka ndiye apho ke.
But only then.	Kodwa ngelo xesha elinye kuphela.
He did not know that it would be so.	Wayengazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Not just work.	Hayi nje umsebenzi.
You do not have to be alone.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube wedwa.
One more thing.	Enye into ngakumbi.
OK No problem.	Kulungile akukho ngxaki.
Yeah, for that.	Ewe, ngaloo nto.
It's better for him there.	Kungcono kuye apho.
Or maybe that's too far.	Okanye mhlawumbi ukuba kude kwakhona.
I do not have a cat.	Andinayo ikati.
He saw that there was no way before.	Wabona ukuba akukho ndlela ngaphambili.
Now about.	Ngoku malunga.
Well, now there is another.	Ewe, ngoku kukho enye.
Finally, he left.	Ekugqibeleni, wemka.
He opened it and handed it to me.	Uye wavula wandinika.
But she could not control herself.	Kodwa ke akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
The place can therefore be just outside.	Indawo ke ngoko ingaba ngaphandle nje.
A little later.	Kancinci mva nje.
This is the whole place.	Le ndawo yonke.
I just wanted a chance.	Ndandifuna nje ithuba.
He thought he wanted to work with her.	Wayecinga ukuba ufuna ukusebenza naye.
I think this is something new.	Ndicinga ukuba le yinto entsha.
When he came to eat, he went in.	Wathi xa eza kutya, wangena.
Because there is no one.	Kuba akukho mntu.
This is almost okay.	Oku phantse kulungile.
And it has to be right.	Kwaye kufuneka ilungile.
I will not speak with you again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe nawe.
He didn't really think.	Wayengacingi ncam.
But only after.	Kodwa kuphela emva.
I think you are interested.	Ndicinga ukuba unomdla.
That's a strange thing.	Yiloo nto engaqhelekanga.
They say yes, that's right.	Bathi ewe, kunjalo.
He too wanted to know things.	Naye wayefuna ukwazi izinto.
Again, for now.	Kwakhona, okwangoku.
It's just the same for me.	Kunjalo nje kum.
The problem then is.	Ingxaki ke yile.
I heard nothing.	Zange ndeva nto.
Do you know how to take.	Ngaba uyazi ukuthatha.
Suddenly, he looked back.	Ngokukhawuleza, wajonga ngasemva.
Nobody seemed to want to be there.	Akukho mntu wayebonakala efuna ukuba lapho.
I definitely should have it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifanele ndibe nayo.
And it's not something else.	Kwaye ayisiyiyo enye into.
At that moment, she did not want to stop thinking.	Ngelo xesha, akazange afune ukuyeka ukucinga.
There is a possibility.	Kukho ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He works with us.	Usebenza kunye nathi.
I think.	Ndikhe ndicinge .
Visible in one room, in one place.	Kubonakala kwigumbi elinye, kwindawo enye.
My old place.	Indawo yam endala.
He knew this was it.	Wayesazi ukuba yiyo le.
Very often.	Kakhulu rhoqo.
You may be angry, but being angry is okay.	Unokuba nomsindo, kodwa ukuba nomsindo kulungile.
I just want you to go.	Ndifuna nje ukuba uhambe.
Where is the problem or am I doing something wrong.	Iphi ingxaki okanye ndenza into engalunganga.
There is more to me than that.	Kukho okuninzi kum ngaphezu koko.
I would have to be alone.	Bekuya kufuneka ndibe ndedwa.
And so it is again here.	Kwaye kunjalo kunjalo kwakhona apha.
You only need one person to buy your house.	Ufuna umntu omnye kuphela ukuthenga indlu yakho.
This means only one thing.	Oku kuthetha into enye kuphela.
That's why he went there.	Yiyo loo nto waya apho.
So they stayed with us.	Bahlala ke nathi.
At school everything is fine, yes.	Esikolweni yonke into ilungile, ewe.
Then he would leave.	Emva koko wayeza kuhamba.
That's not me.	Ayindim ke lowo.
Please check.	Ndincede ndijonge.
Soon you will be here.	Kungekudala uza kuba lapha.
And there is clearly.	Kwaye kukho ngokucacileyo.
I thought he would always be that way.	Ndandicinga ukuba uya kuhlala enjalo.
He said the place was fine.	Wathi indawo ilungile.
I wanted to go out again last night.	Bendifuna ukuphuma kwakhona phezolo.
But then he went back.	Kodwa emva koko wabuyela emva.
It's just, it's just.	Yinto nje, yinto nje.
I wonder who else is doing it.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani omnye owenza.
He wants to do well in school.	Ufuna ukwenza kakuhle esikolweni.
You have all, all the questions.	Unayo yonke, yonke imibuzo.
We'll see if he does though.	Siza kubona ukuba uyayenza na nangona kunjalo.
Well, three, really.	Kulungile, ezintathu, ngokwenene.
No, no, he thought.	Hayi, hayi le, wacinga.
At home no one is that tall.	Ekhaya ekhaya akukho mntu mde ngolo hlobo.
Not if you look bad.	Hayi ukuba ukhangeleka kakubi.
He left, not long ago.	Wemka, kungekudala kangako.
No one needs to know about this.	Akukho mntu kufuneka azi ngale nto.
I know what that will mean for you.	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kuya kuthetha ntoni kuwe.
The only problem.	Ingxaki kuphela.
I'm thinking of getting out.	Ndicinga ukuphuma.
Indeed, sooner rather than later.	Ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
He wanted his parents a little.	Wayefuna abazali bakhe kancinci.
One day he would continue.	Ngenye imini wayeza kuqhubeka.
They will be on the ground.	Baya kuba phantsi.
My father went with me.	Utata wahamba nam.
Or even if he died.	Okanye nokuba wafa.
Money is needed immediately.	Kufuneka imali ngokukhawuleza.
You will be at work.	Uzakuba emsebenzini.
What happened to him.	Kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
He did not walk alone.	Akazange ahambe yedwa.
I never told my father.	Andizange ndimxelele utata.
In the end, everyone knows.	Ekugqibeleni, wonke umntu uyazi.
Because you want to work.	Kuba ufuna ukusebenza.
Behind there is one question.	Ngasemva kukho umbuzo omnye.
And very, very determined.	Kwaye kakhulu, uzimisele kakhulu.
I think he was talking like this.	Ndicinga ukuba wayethetha ngolu hlobo.
He wanted her to agree.	Wayefuna ukuba avume.
But, there is no reason.	Kodwa, akukho sizathu.
I would really like to get that back.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukufumana oko emva.
I don't know which way.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi na indlela.
We were never together.	Asizange sibe kunye.
I need to hear something else.	Kufuneka ndive enye into.
I know that.	Ndiyakwazi oko.
I live in a room looking out over town.	Ndihlala egumbini ndijonge edolophini.
I never did that.	Khange ndiyenze lonto.
You do not have to guess.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ucinge ukuba ungcono.
You really can't tell but.	Ngenene awukwazi ukuxelela kodwa.
He left early.	Uye wahamba kwangethuba.
Will they succeed?	Ngaba baya kuphumelela?
I'm not sure that could happen though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka nangona kunjalo.
This does not seem to be the case here.	Kubonakala ngathi akunjalo apha.
Maybe it's just you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe kuphela.
You can't do that.	Awunako ukuyenza loo nto.
It also takes more time.	Kwakhona kuthatha ixesha elingakumbi.
We need your permission, of course.	Sifuna imvume yakho, kunjalo.
I will have to think more.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngakumbi.
You like it that way, though.	Uthanda ngolo hlobo, nangona kunjalo.
My house, my car, my job.	Indlu yam, imoto yam, umsebenzi wam.
That is good enough.	Nto leyo ilungile ngokwaneleyo.
But this is not necessary.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko.
One has to make a decision.	Umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I'm glad to be home today, though.	Ndiyavuya ukuhlala ekhaya namhlanje, nangona kunjalo.
So we have to do a lot of ourselves.	Ngoko kufuneka senze okuninzi ngokwethu.
How great is all this.	Hayi indlela enkulu ngayo le nto yonke.
You read a lot with him.	Ufunda kakhulu naye.
It is difficult, but possible.	Kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
She went well with it.	Uhambe kakuhle nayo.
He would be alone all day.	Wayeza kuba yedwa imini yonke.
He didn't really know what to do with her.	Wayengazi ngokwenene ukuba enze ntoni ngaye.
And, what happened.	Kwaye, kwenzeka ntoni.
We will do this as soon as possible.	Siza kuyenza ngokukhawuleza oku.
He would be in pain.	Wayeza kuba buhlungu.
You will find the same answer.	Uya kufumana impendulo efanayo.
Don't think about this for a long time.	Musa ukucinga ngale nto ixesha elide.
You probably do all that.	Usenokuba uyayenza yonke loo nto.
But Dad may not know it.	Kodwa utata usenokuba akazi nto ngayo.
He felt that way.	Waziva ngolo hlobo.
He did not stay in the house.	Akazange ahlale endlwini.
This time, again.	Ngeli xesha, kwakhona.
But we will not need this.	Kodwa asiyi kufuna oku.
I hope you like it too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba naye uyayithanda.
There's a mother now.	Ukhona umama ngoku.
Thus he got breakfast for me.	Ngaloo ndlela wafumana isidlo sakusasa kum.
Earning money.	Ukufumana imali.
And we will succeed.	Kwaye siya kuphumelela.
I'm out here !.	Ndilapha phandle!.
You must be doing the right thing.	Umele ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
Nice place in town.	Indawo entle edolophini.
He has to learn from it.	Kufuneka afunde kuyo.
And she never had children.	Kwaye akazange abe nabantwana.
When the time comes.	Xa kufika ixesha.
Please check inside if you feel like it.	Nceda ujonge ngaphakathi ukuba uziva uyayithanda.
I had no idea it would be something like this.	Bendingazi ukuba iya kuba yinto enje.
I do not know when or why.	Andazi ukuba nini okanye kutheni.
It would be a big job for me.	Kuya kuba ngumsebenzi omkhulu kum.
Every day, you know.	Yonke imihla, uyazi.
And it certainly will.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
Then two balls.	Emva koko ibhola ezimbini.
He has promised.	Uye wathembisa.
So we don't go there.	Ngoko asiyi apho.
Or you are.	Okanye ukhona.
And now you know who he is.	Kwaye ngoku uyazi ukuba ngubani.
I don't have to do that.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndiyenze loo nto.
I don’t have to think of anything else.	Akufunekanga ndicinge ngenye into.
My mother left.	Wahamba umama.
This goes on all night.	Oku kuqhubeka ubusuku bonke.
Just as it is possible.	Nje ngokuba kunokwenzeka.
I think it is very possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
You are watching my daughter.	Ujonge intombi yam.
I never told anyone.	Khange ndikhe ndixelele mntu.
There was almost nothing in it.	Kwakungekho nto phantse kuyo.
We had to go up there.	Kuye kwafuneka ukuba siye phaya phezulu.
He took off his coat and went outside.	Wathatha idyasi yakhe waphuma phandle.
In all.	Kukho konke.
He looked back at the car.	Wajonga ngasemva emotweni.
Yes, that's right now.	Ewe, okwangoku kunjalo.
Maybe they'll come tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi baya kufika ngomso.
Her parents and me.	Abazali bakhe kunye nam.
I know he was talking badly about me.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayethetha ngam kakubi.
He wanted other things from me.	Wayefuna ezinye izinto kum.
Not really, he did.	Hayi ngokwenene, uyenzile.
Well you really are.	Kulungile wena ngenene.
Just life, not death.	Ubomi nje, hayi ukufa.
Of course he did not know.	Ewe wayengazi.
It could be earlier.	Inokuba ngaphambili.
I think he is good to have her.	Ndicinga ukuba ulungile ukuba naye.
I come to you today looking for the truth.	Ndiza kuwe namhlanje ndifuna inyaniso.
Learning is something for you.	Ukufunda yinto kuwe.
You know who he is.	Uyazi ukuba ngubani.
This is obviously very difficult.	Oku ngokucacileyo kunzima kakhulu.
They look whole.	Wajonga nzima.
Do not overwork.	Musa ukusebenza kakhulu.
He got there on time.	Wafika apho ngexesha.
It's you and me.	Nguwe kunye nam.
I never went further.	Zange ndiye phambili.
I have to look at some things with you.	Kufuneka ndijonge ezinye izinto nawe.
It makes it really difficult to get to work.	Kwenza kube nzima ngokwenene ukuya emsebenzini.
Well, isn't it?	Kuhle, akunjalo?
He will be back tomorrow.	Uza kubuya ngomso.
It’s all weird upstairs.	Yinto yonke engaqhelekanga phezulu.
But he did not know.	Kodwa oko wayengazi.
I already know.	Sele ndiyazi.
I heard that.	Ndeva kunjalo.
They live with it.	Bahlala nayo.
He did a lot of things.	Wenza into eninzi.
Great idea.	Ingqondo enkulu.
See how you are doing in the morning.	Jonga ukuba uqhuba njani kusasa.
And a hat, of course.	Kwaye umnqwazi, kunjalo.
His mind.	Ingqondo yakhe .
They did not go far.	Abazange baye kude.
Why so.	Kwakutheni ukuze .
I always.	Ndihlala rhoqo.
Anyone to each other.	Nabani na omnye komnye.
Everyone would like to make a lot of money.	Wonke umntu angathanda ukwenza imali eninzi.
And one day he was gone.	Kwaye ngenye imini wayengekho.
I do not remember all of them.	Andikhumbuli yonke.
I will never do it again.	Mna andisayi kuphinda ndiyenze.
It would be strange if he did not do so.	Bekuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga ukuba akenzanga njalo.
I know, because my mother looked up.	Ndiyazi, kuba umama wajonga.
To be on top.	Ukuze ube phezulu.
But he also spent a lot of time outdoors.	Kodwa ke wachitha ixesha elininzi phandle.
Not so with him.	Akunjalo naye.
He sat next to me.	Wahlala ecaleni kwam.
Everyone loves that.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda loo nto.
More than any of us understood.	Ngaphezu kokuba nabani na kuthi waqonda.
But there was nothing at all.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto kwaphela.
And it all did not happen.	Kwaye konke akuzange kwenzeke.
However, it can be very fun.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokuba mnandi kakhulu.
In the meantime, you should go.	Okwangoku, kufuneka uhambe.
He really wanted to think.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukucinga.
I really need to check my phone.	Nyani kufuneka ndijonge ifowuni yam.
He said it really is.	Wathi ngenene kunjalo.
Then the son died.	Wafa ke unyana.
Maybe I was never alone with him.	Mhlawumbi andizange ndibe ndedwa kunye naye.
I look at it not about it.	Ndijonge kuyo hayi ngayo.
I'm just tired all the time.	Ndidiniwe nje ngalo lonke ixesha.
He did not know what he saw.	Wayengazi ukuba wabona ntoni.
My wife went in and lay down.	Wangena umfazi wam walala.
He said that he did not have to.	Wathi akunyanzelekanga ukuba enze njalo.
I could not wait to meet you.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukudibana nawe.
More than me.	Kakhulu kunam.
Well, there was nothing to it, really.	Kulungile, kwakungekho nto kuyo, ngokwenene.
Not much now.	Akukho nto ingako ngoku.
He did not need to think about this.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba acinge ngale nto.
Because it really is.	Kuba kunjalo ngokwenene.
You may be here with him.	Inokuba ulapha kunye naye.
Very big mistake.	Impazamo enkulu kakhulu.
It would be better.	Bekuya kuba ngcono.
But I don't have it.	Kodwa andinayo.
But there was nothing outside.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto ngaphandle.
But he did not want to be in this place.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba kule ndawo.
There will always be an answer.	Kuya kuhlala kukho impendulo.
He died first.	Wafa kuqala.
Yes, thank you very much.	Ewe, enkosi kakhulu.
But no, it's true.	Kodwa hayi, yinyani.
He said he didn't like you.	Wathi akakuthandi.
I feel better about that.	Ndiziva ngcono ngaloo nto.
You will say everything is fine.	Uza kuthi konke kuhamba kakuhle.
But soon thereafter,.	Kodwa kungekudala emva koko, .
Although hard to tell.	Nangona kunzima ukuxelela.
Now he did not.	Ngoku akazange enjenjalo.
Or how exactly.	Okanye njani kanye.
Looks like you like this, and the kids.	Kubonakala ngathi uyayithanda le nto, kunye nabantwana.
Someone started singing.	Umntu waqalisa ukucula.
All right, no.	Kulungile, hayi.
I think that is possible, but it is not possible.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Not yet, not now, anytime.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ngoku, nanini na.
No reason, I just wanted to.	Akukho sizathu, bendifuna nje.
Well, this is fine.	Ewe, oku kulungile.
I thought this was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe lo.
He went to look for more.	Wahamba waya kufuna ezinye.
Going everything.	Ukuhamba yonke into.
I did not want him to leave.	Ndandingafuni ahambe.
Not the eyes.	Hayi amehlo.
He may not know any other truth.	Usenokuba akayazi nayiphi na enye inyaniso.
He would say sorry.	Wayeza kuthi uxolo.
It would have been better if he had thought of what everyone else was doing.	Kungcono ukuba wayecinga into eyenziwa ngumntu wonke.
I'm glad you won so much.	Ndiyavuya uphumelele kangaka.
It seems that permission is needed to do so.	Kubonakala ngathi kufuneka imvume yokwenza oko.
However, you need to know this.	Nangona kunjalo, kufuneka ukwazi oku.
He took his life so quickly.	Wathatha ubomi bakhe ngokukhawuleza.
Something must have happened then.	Inokuba kukho into eyenzekileyo ngoko.
A little talk is fine.	Intetho encinci ilungile.
Or he was hopeful.	Okanye wayenethemba.
When you are good it is.	Xa ulungile kunjalo.
She is lucky to have you.	Unethamsanqa lokuba nawe.
People say that it is very difficult today.	Abantu bathi kunzima ngokwenene namhlanje.
Great, of course.	Enkulu, kunjalo.
Yes, except for the two of us.	Ewe, ngaphandle kokuba sobabini kuphela.
As fun as it may be.	Njengokuba kunokuba mnandi kunjalo.
And more than that.	Kwaye ngaphezu koko.
That makes it a little easier.	Oko kwenza ukuba kube lula kancinci.
I know.	Mna uyazi.
And maybe it's better that way.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kungcono ngolo hlobo.
Maybe it’s a lot, very unusual.	Mhlawumbi yinto eninzi, engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
It is also good for breakfast.	Kwakhona kuhle isidlo sakusasa.
I know you like it very much here.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda kakhulu apha.
I wanted to stay out.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala ngaphandle.
And be with me.	Kwaye ube nam.
It's hard to know what that is.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
To me, it seems a lot more.	Kum, kubonakala kakhulu ngakumbi.
Then there was nothing, no one.	Emva koko kwakungekho nto, akukho mntu.
But money, no.	Kodwa imali, hayi.
Going home.	Ukuya ekhaya.
But back to this song.	Kodwa emva kule ngoma.
But I look.	Kodwa ndijonge.
This is here.	Le nto apha.
He drives his car.	Uqhuba imoto yakhe.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
You can't come up with anything.	Awukwazi ukuza nantoni na.
But always with money.	Kodwa rhoqo ngemali.
Now you! 	Ngoku, wena!
He did not say anything at the time.	Akazange athethe nto ngelo xesha.
I'm going to do it tonight.	Ndiza kuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
Maybe more then.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi ke.
It was not outside.	Kwakungekho ngaphandle.
That would make it easier for him.	Oko bekuya kwenza kube lula kuye.
I think so, of course.	Ndicinga njalo, kunjalo.
But then he went back.	Kodwa ke wabuyela emva.
I feel very bad.	Ndiziva kakhulu.
I do not love you because of you, but because of me.	Andikuthandi ngenxa yakho, kodwa ngenxa yam.
I wanted to help people.	Ndandifuna ukunceda abantu.
I'm afraid I'm alone.	Ndiyoyika ukuba ndedwa.
And he is here now.	Kwaye ulapha ngoku.
And she is so beautiful.	Kwaye mhle kakhulu.
But then he felt strange.	Kodwa ke waziva engaqhelekanga.
He wants to learn more.	Ufuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
Just like you did.	Kanye njengokuba wenza.
He did not leave immediately if he had already left.	Akazange ahambe ngokukhawuleza ukuba uye wahamba.
And you have to be.	Kwaye kufuneka ube .
I wanted to work.	Ndandifuna ukusebenza.
She loves to try to find one.	Uyathanda ukuzama ukufumana enye.
I think this is a very good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba le yinto entle kakhulu.
Death happens here.	Ukufa kwenzeka apha.
You can be very fun.	Unokuba mnandi kakhulu.
Or, better yet, then go with me.	Okanye, kungcono ngakumbi, uze uhambe nam.
Here, of course.	Apha, kunjalo.
Or no, whatever.	Okanye hayi, nokuba yintoni na.
You have to know, but you can't.	Ufanele ukwazi, kodwa awukwazi.
But that wasn’t here or there yet.	Kodwa oko kwakungekho apha okanye apho okwangoku.
No one went.	Akukho mntu waya.
And otherwise.	Kwaye ngenye indlela.
He certainly wasn't there yet.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho okwangoku.
Sooner or later, one has to leave.	Kungekudala okanye kamva, umntu kufuneka ahambe.
He will be here tomorrow.	Uzakuba lapha ngomso.
He understood a little.	Waqonda kancinci.
I never thought that would happen so quickly.	Ndandingacingi ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
It takes time, it takes mistakes.	Kuthatha ixesha, kuthatha iimpazamo.
If someone wants to do something on their own, that's fine.	Ukuba umntu ufuna ukwenza into yedwa, kulungile.
Again, .	Kwakhona, .
I don't think you have to say anything else.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka uthethe enye into.
The place is really nice.	Indawo ilungile ngokwenene.
He’s trying to do a lot.	Uzama ukwenza kakhulu.
And it did not last long.	Kwaye akazange abe ixesha elide.
My mother was not at home.	Umama wayengekho ekhaya.
Thus the story.	Ngaloo ndlela ibali .
You, not so much.	Wena, hayi kakhulu.
Yes, it did.	Ewe, kwaye kwenzeka.
I want him to succeed.	Ndifuna aphumelele.
This will make it very difficult.	Oku kuya kwenza ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
He was living now.	Wayehlala ngoku.
It won't be long to wait.	Akuyi kuba lixesha elide ukulinda.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kufuneka uhlale ujonge ixesha.
And look up.	Kwaye ujonge phezulu.
We will see this throughout this book.	Siza kubona oku kuyo yonke le ncwadi.
Really all about you.	Ngokwenene konke malunga nawe.
I'm glad you feel the same, because.	Ndiyavuya uziva nawe, kuba.
A nice little thing.	Into encinci entle.
Now, nobody has it.	Ngoku, akukho mntu unayo.
He did not want her to give up.	Wayengafuni ukuba ayeke.
So, one day, he was gone.	Ngoko, ngenye imini, wayengekho.
It will all come to you in the end anyway.	Konke kuya kuza kuwe ekugqibeleni kunjalo.
However, this takes a very long time to drive.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu ukuqhuba.
He’s just one person, though.	Ungumntu nje omnye, nangona kunjalo.
And you have to.	Kwaye kufuneka ngoko.
I will do this as I do.	Ndiya kwenza oku njengam.
Please wait for our letter.	Nceda ulinde ileta yethu.
But better, for me.	Kodwa kungcono, kum.
I think you need something else.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna enye into.
Maybe they'll do it again, someday.	Mhlawumbi baya kuphinda, ngenye imini.
True or not I do not know.	Yinyani okanye hayi andazi.
However, there is a big problem.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki enkulu.
I was thinking about all this here.	Bendicinga ngayo yonke le nto apha.
Nobody wants you.	Akukho mntu ufuna wena.
At present this is not the case.	Okwangoku oku akunjalo.
Something happened then.	Kwenzeka into ngoko.
He certainly loves her very much.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyamthanda kakhulu.
You have to be angry.	Ufanele ube nomsindo.
Food is far from you.	Ukutya kude kuwe.
Probably, it is very difficult.	Mhlawumbi, kunzima kakhulu.
I really want to stay with you.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuhlala nawe.
He is just like you and you act like me.	Ufana nawe kwaye wenza njengam.
But do not take our word for it.	Kodwa musa ukuthatha ilizwi lethu ngayo.
I want to know more.	Ndifuna ukwazi kakhulu.
Mary did not agree.	UMariya akazange avume.
But not this one.	Kodwa hayi le enye.
We have done so here.	Senze njalo apha.
But someone did that.	Kodwa kukho umntu owenza loo nto.
Either that, or he just isn't there.	Nokuba yiloo nto, okanye akakho nje.
He did that to her.	Wayenza loo nto kuye.
So, the people stayed.	Ngoko ke, abantu bahlala.
I wanted to try everything.	Ndandifuna ukuzama yonke into.
Are you there???.	Ukhona???.
No one spoke immediately.	Akukho mntu wathetha ngoko nangoko.
Now the big question.	Ngoku umbuzo omkhulu.
But even so.	Kodwa nokuba kunjalo.
Talking a lot.	Ethetha kakhulu.
There was not much to stay in it.	Kwakungekho nto ingako ukuhlala kuyo.
It’s not easy to do, for sure.	Akukho lula ukwenza, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I did not know where.	Ndandingazi ukuba phi.
I think it might be weird.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Of course not today.	Ewe akunjalo namhlanje.
Today I did not do it.	Namhlanje khange ndiyenze.
But not when you speak.	Kodwa hayi xa uthetha.
Your time now.	Ixesha lakho ngoku.
Now I have to go.	Ngoku kufuneka ndihambe.
I can't say more than that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngaphezu koko.
Really, it wasn’t.	Ngokwenene, kwakungekho.
He wanted her to stop.	Wayefuna ukuba ayeke.
But he got a message.	Kodwa wafumana umyalezo.
I don't care about it either.	Nam andikhathali ngayo.
Otherwise there is nothing.	Ngaphandle koko akukho nto.
And then you go to the party.	Kwaye emva koko uye epatini.
I know you well enough.	Ndikwazi kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
I have to look forward.	Kufuneka ndijonge phambili.
Well, he did this for her.	Ewe, wakwenza oku kuye.
After that, he retired.	Emva koko, wathatha umhlala-phantsi.
Finally he went ahead.	Ekugqibeleni waya ngaphambili.
When everything a lot out.	Xa yonke into eninzi ngaphandle.
The one who made the gift.	Lowo wenza isipho.
I did my homework.	Ndenze umsebenzi wesikolo.
He certainly does.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyayenza loo nto.
Good girl.	Intombi elungileyo.
He must have understood.	Umele ukuba waqonda.
I had to think, too.	Kwafuneka ndicinge, nam.
There was nobody there.	Kwakungekho mntu phaya.
So much for me.	Kakhulu hayi into yam.
She is in the house now.	Ulapha endlini ngoku.
And your mom will find someone, too.	Kwaye umama wakho uya kufumana umntu, naye.
There are children too.	Kukho nabantwana.
You know? 	Uyazi?
But he was very scared.	Kodwa wayesoyika kakhulu.
I think of us both.	Ndicinga ngathi sobabini.
I told her about it.	Ndamxelela ngalonto.
She thinks she is very beautiful.	Ucinga ukuba mhle kakhulu.
Then he returned to her.	Emva koko wabuyela kuye.
He thought hard.	Wacinga kakhulu.
Way, way, too.	Indlela, indlela, kakhulu.
You know, if you did.	Uyazi, ukuba uyenzile.
Then next week.	Emva koko kwiveki ezayo.
And singing is hard.	Kwaye ukucula kunzima.
He said he was a friend.	Wathi ngumhlobo.
Yes you really are.	Ewe ukhona ngenene.
And all of that happened recently.	Kwaye konke oko kwenzeka mva nje.
I think you know better now.	Ndicinga ukuba wazi ngcono ngoku.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Ndiye ndacinga ixesha elide ngale nto.
Don't be too hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
It's okay?.	Ilungile?.
Everyone wants it all.	Wonke umntu ufuna konke.
I would like to talk to him.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye.
Yeah, now.	Ewe, ngoku.
There was nothing else to do there.	Kwakungekho enye into yokwenza apho.
And not one at a time.	Kwaye hayi enye ngexesha.
Whether he wanted to go or not.	Nokuba wayefuna ukuya okanye akafuni.
I want to tell my friends about it.	Ndifuna ukuxelela abahlobo bam ngayo.
But it is probably true.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
Like, there is nothing here.	Njengokuba, akukho kwanto apha.
You don't want to go to that.	Awufuni ukuya kuloo nto.
He looked at the phone.	Wajonga ifowuni.
Now he was fully clothed.	Ngoku wayenxibe ngokupheleleyo.
It is very difficult to walk.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba.
He knows everything about us.	Wazi yonke into ngathi.
This happens a lot, though.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
He told me about it.	Wandixelela ngaloo nto.
Now look at this.	Ngoku jonga oku.
Well done to this one.	Wenze kakuhle kule.
Like, nothing.	Njengokuba, akukho nto.
That's why you feel bad.	Yiyo loo nto uziva kakubi.
I read a little story.	Ndifunde kancinci ibali.
You will get a job.	Uya kufumana umsebenzi.
He has spoken to me.	Uye wathetha nam.
So do i .	Nam .
You must come with me.	Kufuneka uze nam.
But, yes, maybe.	Kodwa, ewe, mhlawumbi.
He appeared in our place.	Wabonakala kwindawo yethu.
But help me.	Kodwa ndincede.
If you will be fine.	Ukuba uya kuba ulungile.
I think we will get something.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kufumana into.
And again nothing.	Kwaye kwakhona akukho nto.
And, of course, we all want that to happen.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, sonke sifuna ukuba oko kwenzeke.
Not a good question.	Hayi umbuzo olungileyo.
It’s not fun, it’s not.	Akukho mnandi, akunjalo.
They both live.	Bahlala bobabini.
Because you are looking for a job.	Kuba ufuna umsebenzi.
Then, you wish more.	Emva koko, unqwenela ngakumbi.
Really, it will be better.	Ngokwenene, kuya kuba ngcono.
I know the best way.	Ndiyazi indlela engcono.
I could not find the name.	Andikwazanga ukufumana igama.
We have done enough of that.	Senze ngokwaneleyo oko.
It could be today or tomorrow.	Kunokuba namhlanje okanye ngomso.
I thought you were a good person.	Bendicinga ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
We'll see if that's right.	Siza kubona ukuba kunjalo.
You do not have to tell me.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba undixelele.
Let me tell you how.	Makhe ndikuxelele indlela yokwenza oko.
Only money please.	Imali kuphela nceda.
That would mean that this is the case.	Oko kuya kuthetha ukuba oku kunjalo.
Which, well, sure.	Nto leyo, kulungile, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Soon, it is.	Kungekudala, kunjalo.
Then you come here.	Emva koko uza apha.
Not so at first, though.	Akunjalo ekuqaleni, nangona kunjalo.
You never told anyone about it.	Zange uxelele mntu ngayo.
Now we need another way.	Ngoku sifuna enye indlela.
I do not want to live with you again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndihlale nawe.
This place.	Le ndawo .
Only thing.	Kuphela into.
I think about it all, though.	Ndicinga ngayo yonke loo nto, nangona kunjalo.
He has gone back.	Ukhe wabuyela emva.
I think everyone is here.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu ulapha.
As fast as that.	Ngokukhawuleza ngolo hlobo.
Or you already have it.	Okanye sele unayo.
I could not help anyone.	Andizange ndikwazi ukunceda mntu.
Or maybe you go.	Okanye mhlawumbi uye.
I can't wait to leave.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuhamba.
He almost did.	Uphantse wayenza.
He did a lot of his time.	Wenza okuninzi ngexesha lakhe.
You do it right away.	Uyenza kwangoko.
Not ours maybe.	Hayi wethu mhlawumbi.
Arriving will be difficult.	Ukufika kuya kuba nzima.
We will not attempt to do this here.	Asiyi kuzama ukwenza oku apha.
It wasn't him yet.	Yayingenguye okwangoku.
French will have to do.	IsiFrentshi kuya kufuneka senze.
He left that place immediately after this.	Wemka kuloo ndawo kanye emva kokuba oku kwenzeke.
I think you better tell me.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono undixelele.
It will be with you soon.	Kuya kuba nawe kungekudala.
I just don't have it.	Andinayo nje.
I don't care at all, the same way.	Andikhathali kwaphela, ngendlela efanayo.
I will make my way.	Ndiya kwenza indlela yam.
It will be, very good.	Kuya kuba njalo, kuhle kakhulu.
I should have been here for you.	Bekufanele ukuba ndilapha ngenxa yakho.
And you know that to be true.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yinyani.
He doesn't have to try, so he doesn't.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba azame, ngoko akanjalo.
He is not really like that.	Akanjalo ngokwenene.
That would be very unusual.	Oko kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
Yes, but no.	Ewe, kodwa hayi.
I want to finish.	Ndifuna ukugqiba.
Another woman is here now.	Omnye umfazi ulapha ngoku.
Taller than me.	Phezulu kunam.
If anything, this makes my job even more difficult.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na, oku kwenza umsebenzi wam ube nzima ngakumbi.
If anyone will do it, it is.	Ukuba nabani na uya kwenza, nguye.
You arrived just in time.	Ufike ngexesha kanye.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange ayenze loo nto.
He will do it at home.	Uya kuyenza ekhaya.
If not, soon afterward.	Ukuba akunjalo, kungekudala emva koko.
How wonderful we will be.	Siza kuba mnandi kangakanani.
I didn’t think so, of course.	Ndandingacingi, kunjalo.
The only problem is time.	Ingxaki kuphela lixesha.
Give me a gun.	Ndinike umpu.
He has to be.	Ufanele ukuba nguye.
He can't.	Akakwazi.
There was no one in it.	Kwakungekho mntu kuyo.
Not until tomorrow.	Hayi kude kube ngomso.
I don't know exactly why.	Andazi kanye ukuba kutheni.
it does not have to.	akunyanzelekanga.
You know very well that it is not.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba akunjalo.
Because he did.	Kuba wenza njalo.
You have to and you will.	Kufuneka kwaye uya kwenza.
No one slept next to him.	Akukho namnye walala ecaleni kwakhe.
Only.	Kuphela kuphela.
This means being a great person.	Oku kuthetha ukuba ngumntu omkhulu.
Do the job.	Wenze umsebenzi lowo.
You have to stay inside.	Kufuneka uhlale ngaphakathi.
We will not require this.	Asiyi kufuna oku.
Here it is.	Apha kulungile.
Before my father got home.	Ngaphambi kokuba utata afike ekhaya.
He asked me to sit on his bed.	Uye wandicela ukuba ndihlale ebhedini yakhe.
Something is wrong, I do not know why.	Kukho into engalunganga, andazi ukuba kutheni.
He wanted to stay in the room.	Wayefuna ukuhlala egumbini.
And that seems pretty obvious.	Kwaye oko kubonakala kulungile ngokucacileyo.
But my father is old.	Kodwa utata mdala.
It's just hard for me now.	Kunzima nje kum ngoku.
He is trying to make you think you are everywhere.	Uzama ukwenza ukuba ucinge ukuba ukhona kuyo yonke indawo.
You've told the truth, always.	Uthethe inyaniso, rhoqo.
You are waiting for my response.	Ulindele impendulo yam.
Well, it had to be that way.	Ewe, kwafuneka ukuba kube njalo.
This is certainly true here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku kunjalo apha.
I think yes, maybe.	Ndicinga ukuba ewe, mhlawumbi.
But you do not know it all.	Kodwa awuyazi yonke loo nto.
This is not only possible, it is very possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka kuphela, kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
Or if you can't wait.	Okanye ukuba awukwazi ukulinda.
I think he does it all the time.	Ndicinga ukuba uyenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
You already know that.	Sele uyayazi loo nto.
But, maybe not always.	Kodwa, mhlawumbi akunjalo rhoqo.
Later that evening, he told his daughter.	Kamva ngaloo ngokuhlwa, waxelela intombi yakhe.
I think we should do this.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze le nto.
You can be tall.	Unokuba mde.
I had to tell her everything.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele yonke into.
Nobody does better than I do.	Akukho mntu wenza ngcono kunam.
I thought, a lot of money for us, for us.	Ndacinga, imali eninzi kuthi, ngenxa yethu.
He said he did.	Uthe wenze njalo.
Not only for you but for him, too.	Hayi kuphela kuwe kodwa kuye, naye.
You know everyone and everyone knows you.	Uyazi wonke umntu kwaye wonke umntu uyakwazi.
How did you get here.	Ufike njani apha .
I think you know better.	Ndicinga ukuba wazi ngcono.
So, that's the same thing.	Ngoko ke, yinto enye leyo.
There seemed to be something wrong with him.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kukho into engalunganga kuye.
We should all know this.	Sonke sifanele siyazi oku.
He will probably never go away again.	Mhlawumbi soze aphinde ahambe.
John came into me.	Wangena kum uJohn.
Yes, there is no danger.	Ewe, akukho ngozi.
And that happened again.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka kwakhona.
It will go to someone else.	Iza kuya komnye umntu.
And now is your time.	Kwaye ngoku lixesha lakho.
I said nothing after that.	Khange ndithethe nto emva koko.
That is probably the case.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba yiloo nto kanye.
He knew better, of course.	Wayesazi ngcono, kunjalo.
You don't have to say that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe oko.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo yonke ingxaki.
He said he wanted to say something to me.	Wathi kukho into afuna ukuyithetha nam.
And this time it is very difficult.	Kwaye ngeli xesha kunzima kakhulu.
So you better do as much as you can.	Ngoko ke kungcono ukuba wenze kangangoko.
You should have been scared.	Bekufanele ukuba woyika.
Then some of mine.	Emva koko abanye bam.
I don't want you to tell me that.	Andifuni ukuba undixelele loo nto.
A little more, really.	Kancinci ngakumbi, ngokwenene.
He knows everything about work.	Wazi konke ngomsebenzi.
All is well? 	Konke kulungile?
Or earlier, though.	Okanye ngaphambili, nokuba.
Only, it seemed to us.	Kuphela nje, kwakubonakala ngathi.
Then there are the people.	Emva koko kukho abantu.
He found someone.	Wafumana umntu.
And it happened to me.	Kwaye kwenzeka kum.
I did not look at the monkey.	Khange ndijonge nyani.
The car is a big deal.	Imoto yinto enkulu.
We just want someone to get there.	Sifuna nje umntu ukuba afike apho.
You want to know.	Ufuna ukwazi.
That's all he talks about.	Yiloo nto kuphela ethetha ngayo.
But you are wasting your time.	Kodwa uchitha ixesha.
He walked out the front.	Waphuma ngaphambili.
And again, be human.	Kwaye kwakhona, ube ngumntu.
I knew he would get there.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kufika apho.
Is that true.	Ngaba yinyani leyo .
i am here .	ndilapha .
He did all that.	Wayenza yonke loo nto.
And how beautiful.	Kwaye kuhle kangakanani.
I know you're busy.	Ndiyayazi uxakekile.
But you have to be.	Kodwa kufuneka ube njalo.
Otherwise, another woman will do.	Ngaphandle koko, omnye umfazi uya kwenza.
You do not have to do this.	Akufunekanga uyenze le nto.
He knows nothing at all.	Akazi nto kwaphela.
I don't care about me.	Andikhathali ngam.
I know this because you told me.	Ndiyakwazi oku ngenxa yokuba undixelele.
Do you want to know why.	Ngaba uyafuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
So it can be.	Ngoko ke kunokuba njalo.
I don't think that's a bad thing.	Andiqondi ukuba yinto embi leyo.
He went with her.	Wahamba naye.
He wants to stay here.	Ufuna ukuhlala apha.
I love it when she does.	Ndiyayithanda xa esenza njalo.
We will continue to get better at it.	Siza kuqhubeka ukuba ngcono kuyo.
But you must be ready to do it.	Kodwa kufuneka ukulungele ukuyenza.
That would mean buying one.	Oko bekuya kuthetha ukuthenga enye.
Or no, we'll see.	Okanye hayi, siza kubona.
You obviously do not want to.	Ngokucacileyo awufuni.
This would be unusual.	Oku bekuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
However this is not really the case.	Nangona kunjalo oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
Maybe he spoke.	Mhlawumbi wathetha.
And obviously, of course.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo, kunjalo.
You deserve the truth.	Ufanele inyaniso.
He didn’t want to talk to me, though.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha nam, nangona kunjalo.
He looked down at her.	Wajonga phantsi kwakhe.
I'm so scared of that.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu loo nto.
There is an opportunity.	Kukho ithuba.
I too could not wait.	Nam andizange ndikwazi ukulinda.
The wife too.	Umfazi naye.
He said he needed help.	Wathi ufuna uncedo.
Everyone told me it was going to be hard.	Wonke umntu wandixelela ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
But there is no way.	Kodwa akukho ndlela.
Similar questions.	Imibuzo efanayo.
But this time it should.	Kodwa ngeli xesha kufuneka.
But, above all, it is true.	Kodwa, ngaphezu kwakho konke, yinyani.
Or he will go and he will not go.	Okanye uya kuhamba kwaye akayi kuhamba.
A good dog.	Inja elungileyo.
However this is as far as it goes.	Nangona kunjalo oku kude njengoko kuhamba.
It is very possible that.	Kunokwenzeka kakhulu ukuba.
I have to go faster, though.	Kufuneka ndihambe ngokukhawuleza, nangona kunjalo.
If so, you should too.	Ukuba kunjalo, kufuneka nawe.
Marriage is a job.	Umtshato ngumsebenzi.
I wanted my cat.	Ndandifuna ikati yam.
I wanted to talk to anyone.	Ndandifuna ukuthetha nabani na.
Maybe you did something very wrong.	Mhlawumbi wenze into embi kakhulu.
And you now, too.	Kwaye nawe ngoku, nawe.
That was what everyone said, even though no one was talking about it.	Loo nto yayithethwa ngumntu wonke, nangona kwakungekho mntu wayethetha ngayo.
Or someone else did.	Okanye omnye umntu wenze njalo.
But, tell me something.	Kodwa, ndixelele into.
Two hours, up.	Iiyure ezimbini, phezulu.
Just another thing to do.	Enye nje into yokwenza.
It can be even harder though.	Inokuba nzima ngakumbi nangona.
He just wanted time.	Wayefuna nje ixesha.
It will never happen.	Iya kuze yenzeke.
Just give it to me.	Ndinike nje.
He did all that.	Wenza konke oko.
Mistake! 	Impazamo!
If you want to know, we have to go now.	Ukuba ufuna ukwazi, kufuneka sihambe ngoku.
There is no way he can come and talk to me.	Akukho ndlela yokuba eze kuthetha nam.
They've lived like this before, a long time ago.	Bakhe bahlala ngolu hlobo ngaphambili, kudala kakhulu.
So this is exactly what happened.	Ngoko, kwenzeka kanye loo nto.
He can't do it any other way.	Akanakuyenza ngenye indlela.
But it was not too long.	Kodwa akuzange kube kudala.
In the meantime, how do you want to talk?	Okwangoku, ufuna ukuthetha njani.
Please stay there.	Ndicela uhlale apho.
I've done enough, he thought.	Ndenze ngokwaneleyo, wacinga.
It must be true, he thought.	Kumele ukuba yinyani, wacinga njalo.
There is one thing, though.	Kukho into enye, nangona kunjalo.
Or what will you do.	Okanye uya kwenza ntoni na.
But he learned.	Kodwa wafunda.
We need to do something quickly.	Kufuneka senze into ngokukhawuleza.
His mother comes to him.	Umama wakhe uza kuye.
However, this approach can be challenging.	Nangona kunjalo, le ndlela inokuba nzima.
It seems that it will be so.	Kubonakala ngathi kuya kuba njalo.
You did well.	Wenze kakuhle ke.
Now both of us.	Ngoku sobabini.
As most people do.	Njengoko kwenza abantu abaninzi.
But then he went.	Kodwa wagqiba waya.
You will see a lot.	Uza kubona okuninzi.
Well, not just the woman.	Ewe, hayi kanye umfazi.
It means living together.	Kuthetha ukuhlala kunye.
Too much of a job.	Ukuba kakhulu ukuba umsebenzi.
There was nothing at that time.	Kwakungekho nto ngelo xesha.
And the big thing in that.	Kwaye into enkulu kuloo nto.
Because he has to do it.	Kuba kufuneka ayenze.
But he is often absent.	Kodwa uhlala engekho ixesha elininzi.
But the son is very interested.	Kodwa unyana unomdla kakhulu.
Not tomorrow.	Akukho ngomso.
We'll talk about it tonight.	Siza kuthetha ngayo ngokuhlwanje.
He could not hold back for long.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba ixesha elide.
But not last night.	Kodwa hayi phezolo.
House, maybe.	Indlu, mhlawumbi.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Mhlawumbi inokuba yinto entle.
One day my father was away.	Ngenye imini utata wayengekho.
That is the case in this case.	Oko kunjalo kule meko.
Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni ngokuhlwanje, enkosi ngayo yonke into.
Not this again.	Hayi oku kwakhona.
We both know that there is.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba kukho.
It will all happen tonight.	Konke kuya kwenzeka ngokuhlwanje.
So that I can.	Ukuze ndikwazi.
Not who, however, is as much as what it is.	Hayi ngubani, nangona kunjalo, kakhulu njengoko yintoni.
If they stay.	Ukuba bahlala.
It takes time again.	Kuthatha ixesha kwakhona.
I don't want to work on this.	Andifuni ukusebenza ngale nto.
The big one is good for me.	Enkulu ilungile kum.
I hope your wife is doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba umfazi wakho uqhuba kakuhle.
He thought it was a mistake.	Wacinga impazamo.
I thought you did well.	Ndandicinga ukuba uyenzile kakuhle loo nto.
And so, that's exactly what happened.	Kwaye ke, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I do not know where it is.	Andazi apho kukho.
It looks like he will be a good player.	Kubonakala ngathi iya kuba ngumdlali olungileyo.
But if you don't, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba awufuni, kulungile.
So, we'll start there.	Ngoko, siza kuqala apho.
Problem! 	Ingxaki!
Another good name.	Elinye igama elihle.
But no problem.	Kodwa akukho ngxaki.
I just want to do it.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza.
Right there next to him.	Kanye apho ecaleni kwakhe.
This takes a lot of time.	Oku kuthatha ixesha kakhulu.
I wanted to be alone and think.	Ndandifuna ukuba ndedwa ndicinge.
Again, singing.	Kwakhona, ukucula.
Something like this happened.	Kwenzeka into enje.
He thought he was going to talk a lot.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kuthetha kakhulu.
Not really the reason.	Hayi ngokwenene isizathu.
I may be tired.	Inokuba ndidiniwe.
That or something.	Oko okanye enye into.
I should not have stayed out so late at night.	Akufunekanga ndihlale phandle ebusuku kangaka.
He is one person.	Ungumntu omnye.
Made, well, many things.	Yenziwe, kakuhle, izinto ezininzi.
How and where you know very well.	Njani kwaye phi wazi kakuhle kakhulu.
He tried, but he thought nothing of it.	Wazama, kodwa akazange acinge nto.
He would wait there with her.	Wayeza kulinda apho kunye naye.
Then he went back to the party.	Emva koko wabuyela epatini.
That is not for everyone.	Nto leyo ayinguye wonke umntu.
He was scared, that's why.	Wayesoyika, yiyo loo nto.
Or almost all the way.	Okanye phantse yonke indlela.
Now I can walk slowly.	Ngoku ndiyakwazi ukuhamba kancinci.
I have decided that.	Ndiye ndagqiba kwelokuba.
It's a real strategy.	Licebo ngokwenene.
He said he did not want to wait.	Uthe awufuni kulinda.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi leyo.
And there are a lot of people in the car.	Kwaye kukho abantu abaninzi emotweni.
He looked around town.	Wajonga edolophini.
The mind is right.	Ingqondo ilungile.
Not all the time.	Hayi lonke ixesha.
I wanted more than that, though.	Ndandifuna ngaphezu koko, nangona kunjalo.
Someone is talking to me.	Umntu uthetha nam.
Reading is one thing, speaking another.	Ukufunda yinto enye, ukuthetha enye.
Right in there.	Kanye ngaphakathi apho.
And when he does.	Kwaye xa esenza .
I don't believe we should.	Andikholelwa ukuba sifanele.
However, he did his best.	Nangona kunjalo, wenze konke okusemandleni akhe.
I would have to really think about it.	Bekuya kufuneka ndicinge ngayo ngenene.
Nowhere because there is no time.	Akukho ndawo kuba akukho xesha.
He was speaking only the truth.	Wayethetha inyani kuphela.
He will not come forward.	Akayi kuza ngaphambili.
As his mother used to do.	Njengoko umama wakhe wayedla ngokwenza.
However, he had to make his way.	Nangona kunjalo, kwafuneka enze indlela yakhe.
Life with you.	Ubomi kunye nawe.
I did not stay there.	Khange ndihlale apho.
He realized that he needed to tell her the truth.	Waqonda ukuba kufuneka amxelele inyani.
He looked up at the evening with his voice and.	Ujonge phezulu sangokuhlwa ilizwi lakhe kwaye.
And it can be good.	Kwaye kunokuba kuhle.
It is not really necessary.	Akufunekanga ngokwenene.
If not at night.	Ukuba akunjalo ebusuku.
Yes, obviously, yes.	Ewe, ngokucacileyo, ewe.
In the end, he did not go.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange aye.
I thought he might be going with you.	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba uhamba nawe.
I need a little help here.	Ndifuna uncedo kancinci apha.
Lots of hours and not a lot of money.	Iiyure ezininzi kwaye akukho mali eninzi.
But she did not know much about him.	Kodwa wayengazi kangako ngaye.
This should be simple and easy.	Oku kufuneka kube lula kwaye kube lula.
He says it comes in handy.	Uthi iza kakuhle.
Problem since then.	Ingxaki ukusukela ngoko.
Good thing to do.	Into entle ukuyenza.
He went for that.	Waya kuloo nto.
That, of course, he did.	Oko, ngokucacileyo, wakwenza.
I told her this.	Ndamxelela lento.
But he can't stop talking.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyeka ukuthetha.
I want to see it that way, just like that.	Ndifuna ukubona ngolo hlobo, kanye ngolo hlobo.
Or two things.	Okanye izinto ezimbini.
I love your daughter.	Ndiyayithanda intombi yakho.
No one told her no.	Akukho mntu wamxelela ukuba hayi.
To decide what to do with yourself.	Ukuze wenze isigqibo sokuba wenze ntoni ngawe.
Not that you should.	Akunjalo ukuba ufanele.
Not for someone else.	Hayi komnye umntu.
I will be here for a long time.	Ndiza kuba apha ixesha elide.
Don't just be here.	Musa nje ukuba lapha.
But you know, that's right.	Kodwa ke uyazi ukuba, kunjalo.
He would take food with him.	Wayeza kuthatha ukutya kunye naye.
We did not, however.	Asizange, nangona kunjalo.
If that's all.	Ukuba kuphela oko konke.
I didn't really want to get out of town.	Ndandingafuni ncam ukuphuma edolophini.
You just need your phone back.	Ufuna nje ifowuni yakho emva.
I can do that again.	Ndingayenza loo nto kwakhona.
It is absolutely.	Yiyo ngokupheleleyo.
Then he fell asleep.	Emva koko walala kakubi.
This time up.	Ngeli xesha phezulu.
This will not take long at all.	Oku akuyi kuthatha ixesha elide konke konke.
He will have to do something today.	Kuza kufuneka enze into namhlanje.
Not that most people will show up before noon.	Akunjalo ukuba abantu abaninzi baya kubonakala ngaphambi kwemini.
You just didn't do it.	Awuzange wenze nje.
Three days too.	Iintsuku ezintathu kakhulu.
But he would take whatever he wanted.	Kodwa wayeza kuthatha nantoni na ayifunayo.
But it will not be long.	Kodwa akuyi kuba lixesha elide.
Something happened.	Kwakhe kwenzeka into ethile.
There you are, he thought.	Nantso ke, wacinga.
He didn't speak, really.	Khange athethe, ngenene.
You may have done this well.	Usenokuba uyenzile kakuhle le nto.
He heard one down.	Weva enye phantsi.
I feel it all the time.	Ndiziva ngalo lonke ixesha.
He did not want to see anything.	Wayengafuni ukubona nto.
He doesn't want to go there.	Akafuni ukuya apho.
The food can be very tasty.	Ukutya kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
But he did not want to go to college.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuya ekholejini.
Another agreed.	Omnye wavuma.
However my work does not seem to work.	Nangona kunjalo umsebenzi wam awubonakali usebenza.
But if you want.	Kodwa ukuba uyafuna.
And this is all.	Kwaye oku konke.
No, it is possible.	Hayi, kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
It's a little strange.	Yinto encinci engaqhelekanga.
I'm not even sure where they went.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba baye phi.
I'm not sure if there is one.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho enye.
So, one job.	Ngoko ke, umsebenzi omnye.
I really did that.	Ndenze ngokwenene oko.
Side, not inside or outside.	Ecaleni, hayi ngaphakathi okanye ngaphandle.
You want to talk about me.	Ufuna ukuthetha ngam.
He would never do that again.	Wayengayi kuphinda ayenze loo nto.
Something is happening, a new problem.	Kukho into eyenzekayo, ingxaki entsha.
No one will ever know who made the call.	Akukho mntu uya kuze azi ukuba ngubani owenza umnxeba.
Come a little bit.	Weza kancinci kancinci.
He was talking about this.	Wayethetha lo.
And not just any mistake.	Kwaye hayi nje nayiphi na impazamo.
In this case playing music.	Kule meko ukudlala umculo.
But something very small.	Kodwa into encinci kakhulu.
And tomorrow everything will start all over again.	Kwaye kusasa yonke into iya kuqala kwakhona.
That is a good idea.	Licebo elihle elo.
And no one wants to say that.	Kwaye akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha loo nto.
And there is truth in it.	Kwaye kukho inyaniso kuyo.
I will be there all the time.	Ndiza kuba khona lonke ixesha.
Moreover, if that is possible.	Ngaphezu koko, ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
He has to stay there.	Kufuneka ahlale apho.
There is definitely an error somewhere.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho impazamo kwindawo ethile.
Then and when.	Emva koko kwaye nini enye.
That's it before.	Nantso ke ngaphambili.
So that's the way.	Ngoko nantso indlela.
He said this happens all the time.	Uye wathi oku kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
I'm just not good enough.	Andikho nje ngokwaneleyo.
I suspect later.	Ndiyakrokrela kamva.
Not you, though.	Hayi wena, nangona kunjalo.
It seems that something is happening to him.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
Yes, we need help.	Ewe, sifuna uncedo.
This did not happen at all.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke konke konke.
I feel like staying here.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukuhlala apha.
And he couldn't think.	Kwaye akazange akwazi ukucinga.
Yes, just this way.	Ewe, kanye ngale ndlela.
Small house.	Indlu encinci.
But no one said cat.	Kodwa akukho mntu wathi ikati.
He didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza njani na.
Performance looks good.	Ukusebenza kubonakala kulungile.
He thought he would be.	Wayecinga ukuba uya kuba.
There seems to be a problem.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho ingxaki.
There is everything here.	Kukho yonke into apha.
I could not help you.	Andikwazanga ukukunceda.
We all know something about that.	Sonke siyazi into ngaloo nto.
I made a plan.	Ndenze icebo.
He agreed outside.	Wavuma ngaphandle.
After that, we will be the only two.	Emva koko, siya kuba sobabini kuphela.
Then he asked for more time at work.	Emva koko wacela ixesha elingakumbi emsebenzini.
Not what someone else wants it to be.	Hayi le nto omnye umntu afuna abe yiyo.
I hope something happens.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
He said he wanted to do it.	Wathi ufuna ukwenza.
Whatever he comes he will do.	Nantoni na ezayo uya kuyenza.
Then he came back and did everything.	Emva koko wabuyela kwaye wayenza yonke into.
He also knows exactly what they will be like.	Kwakhona uyazi kakuhle ukuba baya kuba ngantoni.
You like better here.	Uthanda ngcono apha.
It is difficult for both of us.	Kunzima kuthi sobabini.
Stop trying to be successful.	Yeka ukuzama ukuphumelela.
They went to my school.	Baye esikolweni sam.
Probably very often.	Mhlawumbi rhoqo kakhulu.
I think we will be able to do that.	Ndicinga ukuba siya kukwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
And then you want people.	Kwaye ke ufuna abantu.
But it does not have to be this way for you.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo kuwe.
Only this, and nothing.	Kuphela oku, kwaye akukho nto.
You have it right.	Unayo ilungile.
I don't want to but.	Andifuni kodwa.
You really did it this time.	Ngenene uyenzile ngeli xesha.
I didn't look either.	Nam khange ndijonge.
And just one more thing.	Kwaye enye nje into.
It can also be hard to imagine.	Kwakhona kunokuba nzima ukucinga.
Almost too.	Phantse kakhulu.
She is afraid to be alone with me.	Woyika ukuba yedwa nam.
Okay, but only a little bit.	Kulungile, kodwa kuphela kancinci.
One has to talk about dinner.	Umntu kufuneka athethe ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
Questions come quickly.	Imibuzo iza ngokukhawuleza.
More than you, perhaps.	Ngaphezu kwakho, mhlawumbi.
You are smart enough to do that.	Ukrelekrele ngokwaneleyo loo nto.
I have long wanted to meet you.	Kudala ndifuna ukudibana nawe.
He looks strange.	Ukhangeleka engaqhelekanga.
It's okay to say no.	Kulungile ukuba uthi hayi.
He did not make mistakes.	Akazange enze iimpazamo.
Win or win.	Uphumelele okanye uphumelele.
He told her so himself.	Wamxelela njalo ngokwakhe.
This had to be improved.	Oku kwafuneka ukuba ngcono.
It should be easy and difficult.	Kufuneka kube lula kwaye kube nzima.
He wanted anyway.	Wayefuna nangona kunjalo.
It takes a lot of your life.	Kuthatha kakhulu ubomi bakho.
Shortly thereafter, he received a phone call.	Kungekudala emva koko, wafumana umnxeba.
I have been trying this for a long time.	Ndizama oku ixesha elide.
He said he had to drive in order to be able to work.	Wathi kufuneka aqhube ukuze akwazi ukusebenza.
So do you.	Kunjalo nawe.
That's the place now.	Nantso indawo ngoku.
He does not think so.	Akacingi ukuba kunjalo.
But up here it's hard.	Kodwa apha phezulu kunzima.
Don't go any further.	Musa ukuya phambili.
And now he knew.	Ke ngoku wayesazi.
He knew he was saying some.	Wayesazi ukuba wayethetha ezinye.
You do not have to wait that long.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ulinde ixesha elide kangako.
It seemed impossible to move forward.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukuya phambili.
He tried, of course.	Wazama, kunjalo.
Someone else in the room.	Omnye umntu egumbini.
Not just with him.	Hayi nje naye.
So you are sure about him.	Ngoko uqinisekile ngaye.
I am something rather than an actor.	Ndim into kunokuba ngumdlali.
But the police did not agree.	Kodwa amapolisa akazange avume.
You do not have to tell him anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba umxelele enye into.
You have to look down.	Kufuneka ujonge phantsi.
It will be fun for all of us.	Kuya kuba mnandi kuthi sonke.
I don’t want to try to work on my own.	Andifuni kuzama ukusebenza ngokwam.
And reading books.	Kwaye ukufunda iincwadi.
No dad, for now.	Hayi utata, okwangoku.
I like tennis.	Ndiyayithanda intenetya.
He is not alone in this.	Akakho yedwa kuloo nto.
I heard a story recently.	Ndive ibali mva nje.
It was not.	Khange kube .
He is the reason why.	Nguye isizathu sokuba.
But, they did not.	Kodwa, abazange.
He certainly would have a girlfriend.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuba nayo intombi.
He said he didn't need to know.	Wathi akuyomfuneko ukuba azi.
He decided to try another approach.	Wagqiba ekubeni azame enye indlela.
All right, all right, then.	Kulungile, kulungile, ngoko.
And now what? 	Ke ngoku yintoni?
It is very difficult to talk about this.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngale nto.
So stop trying.	Ngoko ke yeka ukuzama.
It was not.	Kwakungekho .
You know it's hard.	Uyazi ukuba kunzima.
But this is not the case here.	Kodwa akunjalo apha kunjalo.
So let me do it.	Ngoko ke mandiyenze.
I'm afraid to go.	Ndiyoyika ukuhamba.
Then he got a chance.	Emva koko wafumana ithuba.
But he told me when he came.	Kodwa undixelele xa efika.
I looked everywhere except myself.	Ndijonge yonke indawo ngaphandle kwam.
And if there is one.	Kwaye ukuba kukho enye.
Again, maybe so.	Kwakhona, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
I would love to help you every now and then again.	Ndingathanda ukukunceda rhoqo ngoku kwaye kwakhona.
That is something you need to know at this time.	Leyo yinto ekufuneka uyazi ngeli xesha.
All is well though.	Konke kulungile kodwa.
So thank you for everything.	Ngoko enkosi ngayo yonke into.
Stop your waiting.	Yeka ukulinda kwakho.
If you can't you can't.	Ukuba awukwazi awukwazi.
All food.	Konke ukutya.
It's even harder this time.	Kunzima ngakumbi ngeli xesha.
Man, everyone very much.	Umntu, wonke umntu kakhulu.
It'll end late, maybe.	Kuza kuphela emva kwexesha, mhlawumbi.
I think you know what it is.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
He knew something bad was going to happen.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into embi eza kwenzeka.
Not inside or out.	Akukho ngaphakathi okanye ngaphandle.
He did not want to read.	Wayengafuni ukufunda.
No one thinks about it again.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngayo kwakhona.
He looked at us.	Wajonga kuthi.
Finally he looked away.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga ecaleni.
Look into the eyes.	Jonga amehlo.
That's a dog.	Nantso inja.
He is doing this now.	Wenza oku ngoku.
You will have to tell me everything about it.	Kuya kufuneka undixelele yonke into ngayo.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbi yiyo yonke loo nto.
Here it is.	Le apha.
In this case, it is you.	Kule meko, nguwe.
But if you do, you do.	Kodwa ukuba uyayenza, uyayenza.
There is something new.	Kukho into entsha.
In that case he does not think anything.	Xa kunjalo akacingi nto.
Well, tell me.	Ke, ndixelele .
But it seems like nothing.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
I couldn't work very hard.	Andikwazanga ukusebenza kakhulu.
Then there was no danger.	Emva koko kwakungekho ngozi.
It is clear what is going on here.	Kucacile ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
I can't wait to see what happens.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
It seems to have happened here.	Kubonakala ukuba kwenzeke apha.
I will not be alone.	Andiyi kuba ndedwa.
But that will end.	Kodwa oko kuya kuphela.
It all comes sooner or later.	Konke kuza ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva.
Nothing about us.	Akukho nto ngathi.
I wonder what his name is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani igama lakhe.
He will take his time.	Uya kuthatha ixesha lakhe.
I suspect you have it.	Ndiyarhana ukuba unayo.
The sooner he did, the better.	Ngokukhawuleza wayenza, ngcono.
Which means he had to leave.	Nto leyo ethetha ukuba kwafuneka ahambe.
Not everything is wrong.	Asiyonto yonke engalunganga.
My wife would probably like that.	Umfazi wam mhlawumbi angathanda oko.
In the end it never happened.	Ekugqibeleni akuzange kube njalo.
He left me.	Uye wemka kum.
We want to think a little '.	Sifuna ukucinga kancinci'.
Now, one can be.	Ngoku, umntu unokuba.
It never happened again.	Ayizange yenzeke kwakhona.
We have never done this before.	Asizange siyenze le nto ngaphambili.
Finding our place.	Ukufumana indawo yethu.
In a small way.	Ngendlela encinci.
I love her attention.	Ndiyayithanda ingqalelo yakhe.
I'm not sure that much.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kakhulu.
He was not at work.	Wayengekho emsebenzini.
Success, it seems, is almost impossible.	Ukuphumelela, kubonakala ngathi, akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
I don't want to be this way.	Andifuni kuba ngolu hlobo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ixesha lokwenza oko ngoku.
We will definitely be back again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kubuya kwakhona.
You know, it really isn't.	Uyazi, akunjalo ngokwenene.
He did not say more than that.	Akazange athethe ngaphezu koko.
Something happens every night.	Kukho into eyenzekayo rhoqo ebusuku.
Always, always, always !.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, rhoqo, rhoqo!.
Well, he wasn't going anywhere.	Ewe, wayengayi ndawo.
I want to know how long this situation will last.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba le meko iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
However, we made a mistake here.	Nangona kunjalo, senze impazamo apha.
I never thought of anything better.	Andizange ndicinge enye into engcono.
That's what it is today.	Yiloo nto ke namhlanje.
I did not see him for a long time after that.	Khange ndimbone ixesha elide emva koko.
My little cat.	Ikati yam encinci.
Here, almost everything happens.	Apha, phantse yonke into eyenzekayo.
I never got far.	Andizange ndifike kude.
All in my place.	Konke kwindawo yam.
I wanted to sing.	Ndandifuna ukucula.
I feel tired of it.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe yiyo.
Who are you thinking.	Ucinga bani .
My father is a doctor.	Utata wam ugqirha.
I want you to be that way.	Ndifuna ube njalo.
But all is not as it seems.	Kodwa konke akunjalo njengoko kubonakala.
He thinks about doing something.	Ucinga ngokwenza nto.
You have to go to school.	Kufuneka uye esikolweni.
I know her daughter and she is a good person.	Ndiyayazi intombi yakhe kwaye ungumntu olungileyo.
He has been out for too long.	Uye waphuma ixesha elide kakhulu.
This is the case last week.	Oku kunjalo kwiveki ephelileyo.
That's right there.	Yiyo kanye apho.
However, this is only apparent.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kubonakala kuphela.
I can do this.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza le nto.
I think well.	Ndicinga kakuhle .
My father went easy on me.	Utata wahamba lula kum.
I am new.	Mna omtsha.
I will stay alone for a while.	Ndiza kuhlala ndedwa kancinci.
I am the only one.	Ndim kuphela.
I am the only one with him.	Ndim naye kuphela.
We need your help !.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho!.
He came back to me.	Uye wabuyela kum.
You can't think clearly.	Awukwazi ukucinga ngokucacileyo.
You will get everything from me.	Uya kufumana yonke into kum.
Well, whatever it is.	Kulungile, nokuba yintoni na.
I think you are totally thankful.	Ndicinga ukuba enkosi ngokupheleleyo.
Everything will happen just the way you want it to.	Yonke into iya kwenzeka kanye ngendlela ofuna ngayo.
Or what will it be.	Okanye iya kuba yintoni na.
Our son is doing well.	Unyana wethu wenza ngcono.
No no .	Hayi hayi .
But it is not very easy.	Kodwa akukho lula kakhulu.
That, and.	Oko, kwaye.
Really swimming.	Ngokwenene ukuqubha.
We want to see what is going on here.	Sifuna ukubona ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni apha.
But, my wife has a problem with it.	Kodwa, umfazi wam unengxaki nayo.
I can't think right now.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngoku.
He has been with her for a long time.	Uhleli naye ixesha elide.
Yes, just like that.	Ewe, kanye ngolo hlobo.
I know you won't do anything.	Ndiyazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
If anything.	Ukuba nantoni na .
Yes, he was not.	Ewe, wayengekho.
You will find your answer there.	Uya kufumana impendulo yakho apho.
I wanted it fast.	Ndandifuna ngokukhawuleza.
It should not be so hard.	Akufanele kube nzima ngolo hlobo.
One has to just talk.	Kufuneka umntu athethe nje.
This can be very good.	Oku kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
You feel really bad.	Uziva kakubi ngokwenene.
It was all over for him.	Kwaphela ngaye.
But he did not come alone.	Kodwa akazange afike yedwa.
There is always something good for everyone.	Kuhlala kukho into entle kuye wonke umntu.
Maybe even a little sleep.	Mhlawumbi nokuba ulele kancinci.
Everything is work.	Yonke into ngumsebenzi.
I know one at a time.	Ndiyazi enye ngexesha.
I'm trying to tell the truth.	Ndizama ukuthetha inyani.
He said he didn't like it.	Wathi akayithandi.
You have to do it to be.	Kufuneka wenze ukuze ube.
It is also difficult.	Kwakhona kunzima.
For me all.	Ngam wonke.
No, it could be me.	Hayi, inokuba ndim.
If you want that.	Ukuba ufuna oko.
People live well there.	Abantu bahlala kakuhle apho.
He did not want to go anywhere.	Wayengafuni ukuya kwindawo.
No one ever said no.	Akukho mntu wakha wathi hayi.
It's just not fun.	Akukho mnandi nje.
Now she thought it was him.	Ngoku wayecinga ukuba nguye.
I don't know how long it will last.	Andazi ukuba kuya kude kube nini.
I wanted to tell you right away.	Bendifuna ukukuxelela kwangoko.
I like the car.	Ndiyayithanda imoto.
For now .	Okwangoku .
He took his wife.	Wathatha umfazi wakhe.
He really does.	Uyayenza ngokwenene.
Maybe they always say yes.	Mhlawumbi bathi ewe rhoqo.
Well, okay, thank you.	Ewe, kulungile, enkosi.
I forgot about you.	Ndilibele ngawe.
But you can do it too.	Kodwa nawe ungayenza loo nto.
We all know why.	Sonke siyazi ukuba kutheni.
You did it, so what.	Uyenzile, yintoni ke.
She does not want to go to the hospital.	Akafuni ukuya esibhedlele.
He looked behind her, but there was no one there.	Wajonga emva kwakhe, kodwa kwakungekho mntu apho.
They will do.	Baya kwenza.
Obviously, this will not last.	Ngokucacileyo, oku akuyi kuhlala.
I have no abnormality, intelligence, or anything else.	Andinayo into engaqhelekanga, ingqondo, okanye enye into.
In fact, he built very well.	Ngokwenene, wakha kakuhle kakhulu.
And a party.	Kwaye itheko.
Now we go somewhere.	Ngoku siya kwindawo ethile.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngakumbi.
You will be the first one there.	Uya kuba ngowokuqala apho.
Quick, really.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokwenene.
I will not be like that at all.	Andiyi kuba njalo tu.
That's the time.	Lixesha elo.
I wish you knew.	Akwaba ubusazi.
It simply means that you will be fully present.	Kuthetha nje ukuba uya kuba khona ngokupheleleyo.
Everyone at school knows.	Wonke umntu esikolweni uyazi.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nawe.
This, of course, costs a lot of money.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuthatha imali eninzi.
However, we do not have to go that far.	Nangona kunjalo, akufuneki ukuba apha siye kude kangako.
He just kept going.	Waqhubeka nje.
I have already learned a lot.	Sele ndifunde okuninzi.
I will need your help to do that.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo lwakho ukwenza oko.
That must be.	Oko kumele ukuba .
He has opened the door himself.	Uye wavula ucango ngokwakhe.
Here, or here.	Apha, okanye apha.
One image.	Umfanekiso omnye.
He did more.	Wenze ngakumbi.
There is more to it.	Kukho okuninzi kuyo.
My father never spoke to me again.	Utata akazange aphinde athethe nam.
Food and fast.	Ukutya kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
Not a bad thing to have.	Hayi into embi ukuba nayo.
He agreed, really.	Wavuma, ngokwenene.
Look at his work.	Jonga umsebenzi wakhe.
You do not have to do this completely.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku ngokupheleleyo.
But just give me a chance.	Kodwa ndinike nje ithuba.
I hope you will go with us.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuhamba nathi.
Living alone.	Ukuhlala wedwa.
There really is no reason for this to be the case.	Ngokwenene akukho sizathu sokuba oku kube njalo.
I'll take things here.	Ndiza kuthatha izinto apha.
Now he has come after her.	Ngoku uye weza emva kwakhe.
He speaks his mind.	Uthetha ingqondo yakhe.
You have the ball.	Unayo ibhola.
He was not long outside.	Wayengekho ixesha elide ngaphandle.
I need to know if you want to stay.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuhlala.
All of us, you and me.	Sonke, wena kunye nam.
It was not necessary to do so.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukwenjenjalo.
I live far away.	Ndihlala kude kakhulu.
It can be a little difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kancinci.
He will have no other choice.	Akayi kuba nayo enye indlela.
We need to be here for three days.	Kufuneka sibe apha iintsuku ezintathu.
Everyone is doing well.	Wonke umntu uqhuba kakuhle.
You know when and where you will have children.	Uyazi ukuba uya kuba nabantwana kwaye nini.
I'm not sure what the name is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ngubani igama.
I'm so sorry for being late.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngokuba late.
You're right, you're just busy.	Ulungile, uxakekile nje.
He ran to the side, looked down.	Wabaleka waya ecaleni, wajonga phantsi.
Music just now.	Umculo nje ngoku.
Well, when you think about it, that's the same thing.	Kulungile, xa ucinga ngayo, yinto enye leyo.
Until one of us wins.	Kude omnye wethu aphumelele.
I ask anyone.	Ndicela nabani na.
Work is just work.	Umsebenzi ngumsebenzi nje.
He tried some more.	Wazama ezinye ngakumbi.
My son is a good child.	Unyana wam ngumntwana olungileyo.
Or my father.	Okanye utata wam.
And it takes time to do that.	Kwaye kuthatha ixesha ukwenza oko.
Please check back often.	Nceda ujonge kwakhona rhoqo.
I look down at the food.	Ndijonge ukutya phantsi.
He tried it himself.	Wazama ngokwakhe.
He sat right behind me.	Wahlala kanye emva kwam.
It was never before.	Kwakungekho ngaphambili.
There was probably nothing about it.	Kwakungekho mhlawumbi malunga nayo.
I did not for years.	Andizange iminyaka.
You will need a local person.	Uya kufuna umntu wasekhaya.
Well, this is something you have to think about.	Ewe, le yinto ekufuneka ucinge ngayo.
He looked away from the doctor.	Uye wajonga ecaleni ugqirha.
I arrived just in time.	Ndifike kanye ngexesha.
I know he will do it, he will surely do it.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kukwenza, ngokuqinisekileyo uya kwenza.
Unless it did, not really.	Ngaphandle kokuba ayizange, hayi ngokwenene.
I live in school.	Ndihlala esikolweni.
I never felt bad about this.	Andizange ndive kakubi ngale nto.
No one ever told me a story.	Akukho mntu wakha wandixelela ibali.
And maybe you should.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ufanele ube.
This, by the way, is unusual.	Oku, ngendlela, yinto engaqhelekanga.
And he was talking to me about it.	Kwaye wayethetha nam ngaloo nto.
And about me.	Kwaye ngam.
There was no need, after all.	Kwakungekho mfuneko, emva koko.
So he would wait.	Ngoko wayeza kulinda.
He promised that it would happen soon.	Wathembisa ukuba oko kuza kwenzeka kungekudala.
But really, people.	Kodwa ngokwenene, abantu.
Is it, really ?.	Ngaba, ngokwenene?.
Everyone wants to get married.	Wonke umntu ufuna umtshato.
Or have you ever thought.	Okanye ukhe wacinga.
All right, let me tell you what happened.	Kulungile, ukukuxelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
His new place.	Indawo yakhe entsha.
No one lives outside.	Akukho mntu uhlala ngaphandle.
Mind, no problem.	Ingqondo, akukho ngxaki.
I will be sorry for that.	Ndiza kuba buhlungu ngaloo nto.
A little something, of course.	Into encinci, kunjalo.
Everyone did a good job.	Wonke umntu wenze umsebenzi omhle.
I do not remember what.	Andikhumbuli yintoni.
She has to tell him about it.	Kufuneka amxelele ngayo.
But here it is not.	Kodwa apha ayisiyiyo.
You just have to make time to do it.	Kufuneka nje wenze ixesha lokwenza oko.
You can drive a car.	Uyakwazi ukuqhuba imoto.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga.
This to me, you know.	Oku kum, uyazi.
But are you going.	Kodwa ngaba uya .
Not my children, not my parents.	Hayi abantwana bam, hayi abazali bam.
I know all about it.	Ndiyazi konke ngayo.
That will take days to work.	Oko kuya kuthatha iintsuku ukusebenza.
I thought you knew that.	Bendicinga uyayazi lonto.
Something terrible must have happened.	Kumele ukuba kukho into embi eyenzekileyo.
I wanted a phone.	Bendifuna ifowuni.
There is no way to do it any other way.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oko ngenye indlela.
He is sitting in his office.	Uhleli eofisini yakhe.
You better just go.	Kungcono uhambe nje.
You never thought about it.	Khange ucinge ngayo.
I would love to be with you.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba nawe.
I can do it myself.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza ngokwam.
Yes thank you.	Ewe Enkosi.
Then you read a book.	Emva koko ufunda incwadi.
Yes, it is very good.	Ewe, ilungile kakhulu.
However, this is not easy.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akukho lula.
You love this place, really.	Uyayithanda le ndawo, ngenene.
He knew he had to stop there.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ayeke apho.
Nice to have you in the area.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nawe kwindawo.
Eventually you would like to work or not.	Ekugqibeleni ungathanda ukusebenza okanye hayi.
All right now this.	Kulungile ngoku oku.
You will have to wait a little longer.	Kuya kufuneka ulinde kancinci.
No one wanted to leave.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuhamba.
That is clearly impossible.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
There are a lot of people here.	Kukho abantu abaninzi apha.
He was late that morning.	Wayesele emva kwexesha ngaloo ntsasa.
That's all and smart, too.	Yonke loo nto kwaye ukrelekrele, naye.
We need three people to do the job.	Sifuna abantu abathathu ukwenza lo msebenzi.
He knew better, but he did it.	Wayesazi ngcono, kodwa wakwenza oko.
I hope it will last a long time.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elide.
Not before, not after, in time.	Hayi ngaphambili, hayi emva, ngexesha.
He left.	Wahamba .
It seems like something like this.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto enje.
He didn't look good thinking.	Wayengabonakali kakuhle ukucinga.
You may be too late.	Unokuba late kakhulu.
He was not there though.	Wayengekho nangona kunjalo.
As we should have been together.	Njengoko bekufanele ukuba sibe kunye.
He could not stay.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala.
He asked me why three.	Wandibuza ukuba kutheni ezintathu.
But now he is the problem.	Kodwa ngoku nguye ingxaki .
Not now, but later.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa kamva.
He picked up his phone.	Wathatha ifowuni yakhe.
And he came to me.	Kwaye weza kum.
All right, now.	Kulungile, ngoku.
His case, really.	Ityala lakhe, ngokwenene.
Almost attention.	Phantse ingqalelo.
It seemed so.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kunjalo.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
I make a man.	Ndenza umntu.
Only something happened.	Kuphela into eyenzekayo.
And then there I am.	Kwaye ke kukho mna.
I would like to think so.	Ndingathanda ukucinga ukuba kunjalo.
Certainly no one will do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu uya kwenza.
I know something is very wrong.	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga kakhulu.
This is good for you.	Oku kulungile kuwe.
Someone told her that she was just like me.	Umntu umxelele ukuba ufana nam ngokwaneleyo.
Maybe you better go.	Mhlawumbi kungcono uhambe.
Something is going to happen to you.	Kukho into eza kwenzeka kuwe.
What else?!.	Yintoni enye?!.
The work has done well.	Umsebenzi wenze kakuhle.
It takes a bit.	Kuthatha kancinci.
Or by doing too much at one time.	Okanye ngokwenza kakhulu ngexesha elinye.
I had to do something and quickly.	Kwafuneka ndenze into kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
This is unlikely to happen.	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kwenzeke.
He talked to her every day.	Wayethetha naye yonke imihla.
You know, and whatever comes next.	Uyazi, kunye nantoni na ezayo.
He looked at me.	Wajonga ecaleni kwam.
No, not bad.	Hayi, hayi kakubi.
You must come with us.	Kufuneka uze kunye nathi.
And no, this is fine.	Kwaye hayi, oku kulungile.
Then he talks to you.	Emva koko uthetha nawe.
Please stay there.	Nceda uhlale phaya.
He told me to talk to anyone.	Wandixelela ukuba ndithethe nabani.
It will look this way.	Kuya kubonakala ngale ndlela.
I never read a book again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndifunde incwadi.
What are you talking about?.	Ingaba uthetha ngantoni?.
Obviously it is better that way.	Ngokucacileyo kungcono ukuba kunjalo.
As for .	Ngoko .
There is not much to do.	Akukho kakhulu ukwenza.
It will just be a thing.	Kuya kuba yinto nje.
We have to go, as soon as you are ready.	Sifanele sihambe, ngokukhawuleza xa ulungile.
They will try to control themselves.	Baza kuzama ukuzibamba.
Always the same way.	Ngalo lonke ixesha indlela enye.
My mother, never.	Umama wam, zange.
In his car.	Emotweni yakhe.
He is waiting for you here.	Ulinde wena apha.
He talks a lot about it.	Uthetha ngayo kakhulu.
There is no reason to be sad.	Akukho sizathu sokuba buhlungu.
You were not very successful.	Awuzange uphumelele kakhulu.
It's just real, that's all.	Yinyani nje, yiyo yonke into.
Then he realized he was thinking too much.	Emva koko waqonda ukuba ucinga kakhulu.
Another stayed there.	Omnye wahlala apho.
But not just anyone.	Kodwa hayi nje nabani na.
The location is also good.	Indawo nayo ilungile.
I want the truth from you.	Ndifuna inyaniso kuwe.
But this did happen.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka.
Someone else will take the time.	Omnye umntu uya kuthatha ixesha.
That you will not do.	Oko awuyi kuyenza.
If you have to go, you have to go.	Ukuba kufuneka uhambe, kufuneka uhambe.
Please see our response.	Nceda ujonge impendulo yethu.
But something.	Kodwa into.
I wanted everyone to go with me.	Nam ndandifuna wonke umntu ahambe nam.
Quickly, for sure.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokuqinisekileyo.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange afike.
I know you know how to do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
Then your wife will do it.	Emva koko umfazi wakho uya kwenza.
Not for you but for someone else.	Hayi ngenxa yakho kodwa omnye.
But, yes.	Kodwa, ewe.
But you certainly know a lot better.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi kakhulu ngakumbi.
Yes, tall.	Ewe, mde.
Not at all.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo akunjalo.
Only a few days and then you will be here.	Kuphela nje iintsuku ezimbalwa kwaye emva koko uya kuba lapha.
Something, not entirely.	Into, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
He said he would do it.	Wathi uya kuyenza.
I'm sure you are too.	Ndiqinisekile nawe unjalo.
I made another mistake.	Ndenza enye impazamo.
But he did something great with it.	Kodwa wenza into enkulu ngayo.
Or good enough.	Okanye kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
This time, he appeared completely.	Ngeli xesha, wabonakala ngokupheleleyo.
You do not want more.	Awufuni ezinye.
You definitely told her.	Ngokuqinisekileyo umxelele.
Coffee, if you have it.	Ikofu, ukuba unayo.
They will do very well there.	Baya kwenza kakuhle kakhulu apho.
All in a good place.	Konke kwindawo elungileyo.
One has to try, though.	Umntu kufuneka azame, nangona kunjalo.
He thought of many things.	Wayecinga izinto ezininzi.
You should not think badly of me.	Akufunekanga ucinge kakubi ngam.
I can't make people.	Andikwazi ukwenza abantu.
Getting there, however, will be even more difficult.	Ukufika apho, nangona kunjalo, kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
The reason he came here.	Isizathu sokuba eze apha.
And then it will be because of him.	Kwaye ke kuya kuba ngenxa yakhe.
He thought it might be you.	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguwe.
It's so much better this way.	Kungcono kakhulu ngale ndlela.
He wouldn't hurt her.	Wayengayi kuyenza buhlungu.
I have never done it with anyone before.	Andizange ndiyenze nabani na ngaphambili.
Next week now.	Kwiveki ezayo ngoku.
Maybe it's my friend.	Mhlawumbi ngumhlobo wam.
I did not see the children.	Andizange ndibone abantwana.
But no one took our place.	Kodwa akukho mntu wathatha indawo yethu.
You better get away from it.	Kungcono uye kude kuyo.
The food should be delicious and tasty.	Ukutya kufuneka kube mnandi kwaye kube mnandi.
But everyone knew what to do.	Kodwa wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo .
But he will be.	Kodwa uya kuba.
There is a small problem.	Kukho ingxaki encinci.
And a few more after that.	Kwaye ezinye ezimbalwa emva koko.
Our room, now.	Igumbi lethu, ngoku.
I'll be back!.	Ndiza kubuya!.
He knew it well there.	Wayesazi kakuhle apho.
Outside no one is thinking too much about it.	Phandle akukho mntu ucinga kakhulu ngayo.
I forgot your name.	Ndilibele igama lakho.
But today she could not control herself.	Kodwa namhlanje akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
I don't even know what else.	Andazi nokuba yintoni enye.
He said he felt bad.	Uthe uziva kakubi.
Or he may have thought about his schoolwork.	Okanye wacinga ngomsebenzi wakhe wesikolo.
You can't buy anything.	Awukwazi ukuthenga nantoni na.
If you know what you want now, fine.	Ukuba uyazi ukuba ufuna ntoni ngoku, kulungile.
I start tomorrow.	Ndiyaqala ngomso.
Well, he thought so.	Ewe, wayecinga njalo.
So it takes more time.	Ngoko kuthatha ixesha elingakumbi.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukwenza loo nto.
Great, really.	Enkulu, ngokwenene.
Again, not a bit of it.	Kwakhona, hayi kancinci kuyo.
He appears.	Ubonakala .
He did not come later.	Akazange eze kamva.
It certainly seems so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi kunjalo.
He spoke harshly.	Wathetha kakubi.
He just stayed in it.	Wahlala nje kuyo.
But please look up.	Kodwa ndicela ujonge phezulu.
No, not to him.	Hayi, hayi kuye.
I don't have either.	Nam andinayo.
Then three weeks.	Emva koko iiveki ezintathu.
I can't stay away from him at all.	Andikwazi tu ukuhlala kude naye.
I think it will be good for you.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kuwe.
He died anyway.	Wafa kunjalo.
I will not be late.	Andiyi kuba mva.
He spent years in it.	Wachitha iminyaka kuyo.
I just felt a little bit.	Ndive nje kancinci.
That he didn't even know what it was.	Loo nto wayengazi nokuba yintoni na.
And by the way.	Kwaye ngendlela.
And that really should be.	Kwaye ukuba ngokwenene kufuneka kube.
He would certainly get his name now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kufumana igama lakhe ngoku.
He may well have been telling the truth.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayethetha inyaniso.
What you already know.	Oko sele uyazi.
You want to do the right thing.	Ufuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
I'm not entirely sure though.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo nangona kunjalo.
You know, whatever.	Uyazi, nantoni na.
And he is busy.	Kwaye uxakekile.
Now look here.	Ngoku jonga apha.
I've been here all week.	Ndilapha iveki yonke.
I don't want to do it either.	Nam andifuni kwenza.
And we'll see how he does.	Kwaye siza kubona ukuba wenza njani.
But that was not the case.	Kodwa akuzange kube ngelo xesha kanye.
He did not know what was happening.	Akazange azi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I've never done that before, certainly not in the office.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili, ngokuqinisekileyo hayi eofisini.
Please tell me, please.	Nceda undixelele, nceda.
Well, it never was.	Ewe, akuzange kube njalo.
Not out.	Hayi ukuphuma.
I'm not sure what I'm talking about.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndithetha ngantoni.
With that, my wife speaks worse.	Ngaloo nto, umfazi wam uthetha kakubi ngakumbi.
It just seemed obvious.	Kwakubonakala nje kucacile.
His name is a man.	Igama lakhe yindoda.
I made a mistake.	ndenze impazamo.
This may be what you are trying to do.	Oku kunokuba yile nto uzama ukuyenza.
He's just a really good man.	Ungumntu nje olungileyo ngenene.
I would love to be with her.	Ndingathanda ukuba naye.
But maybe you know? 	Kodwa mhlawumbi uyazi?
But that is about to happen.	Kodwa yinto eza kwenzeka.
It seems to be something that is happening.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto eyenzekayo.
It is better not to do it.	Kungcono ukuba angayenzi.
Then he thought more of it.	Emva koko wacinga ngayo ngakumbi.
To you and me.	Kuwe nam.
Maybe you do it every day.	Mhlawumbi uyenza yonke imihla.
Do not go to the hospital immediately.	Musa ukuya esibhedlele ngokukhawuleza.
He told me all about you.	Wandixelela konke ngawe.
I wanted to meet you first.	Bendifuna ukudibana nawe kuqala.
I can really talk to him.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha naye ngokwenene.
I wondered what it was.	Ndacinga ukuba yintoni na.
I think that's true though.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani nangona kunjalo.
I wanted to talk to everyone.	Ndandifuna ukuthetha naye wonke umntu.
Yes, that will.	Ewe, oko kuya kukwenza.
My wife doesn't like it.	Umfazi wam akayithandi.
Another time.	Elinye ixesha ke.
Another similar mistake.	Enye impazamo efanayo.
Or he may have done so repeatedly.	Okanye wayedla ngokwenza njalo.
He said he should talk to you.	Uthe kufuneka athethe nawe.
He drives an old car.	Uqhuba imoto endala.
He has to go home.	Kufuneka agoduke.
Or to do anything really.	Okanye ukwenza nantoni na ngokwenene.
We want money now.	Sifuna imali ngoku.
I'm not sure what exactly is wrong.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni kanye kanye engalunganga.
There was, however, no other way.	Kwakungekho, nangona kunjalo, enye indlela.
He thought so at the time.	Wayecinga njalo ngelo xesha.
Yes, he will.	Ewe, uya kwenza njalo.
Inside, he fell asleep.	Ngaphakathi, walala.
You always think about it.	Uhlala ucinga ngayo.
You could be in this situation.	Unokuba wena kule meko.
You must be a great person.	Umele ukuba ungumntu omkhulu.
No need for you.	Akukho mfuneko kuwe.
Here, in the city.	Apha, edolophini.
And many things.	Kwaye izinto ezininzi.
But we need more time.	Kodwa sifuna ixesha elingakumbi.
Because it's hard to do.	Kuba kunzima ukwenza.
You don’t seem too committed to yourself though.	Awubonakali uzimisele kakhulu kuwe nangona kunjalo.
Only more true.	Kuphela yinyani ngakumbi.
This will not be the case going forward.	Oku akuyi kuba njalo ukuya phambili.
He sits on the side.	Uhlala ecaleni.
It is impossible to think at all.	Akunakwenzeka ukucinga konke konke.
No one is coming here.	Akukho mntu uza apha.
I'm just telling the truth.	Ndithetha nje inyani.
At first it is not easy.	Ekuqaleni akukho lula.
However, that is not the case at all.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo kwaphela.
He must have known what was going to happen.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
He thought at the same time.	Wayecinga kanye kanye.
This work will continue for three years.	Lo msebenzi uza kuqhubeka iminyaka emithathu.
I'll do another one.	Ndiza kwenza enye.
I just wanted to get a phone call.	Bendifuna nje ukufumana ifowuni.
Everyone is doing well.	Wonke umntu wenza kakuhle.
He didn't seem to be doing anything right.	Wayengabonakali ukwenza nantoni na elungileyo.
He had to stop thinking about her like that.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukucinga ngaye ngolo hlobo.
It must be so.	Kumele ukuba kunjalo.
But how that happens to you.	Kodwa ukuba oko kwenzeka njani kuwe.
We need your help to make it happen.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho ukuze kwenzeke.
Any or all.	Nayiphi na okanye yonke.
You are trying to find someone else.	Uzama ukufumana omnye umntu.
If this could be him.	Ukuba le inokuba nguye.
Maybe outside, look at it.	Mhlawumbi ngaphandle, ujonge kuyo.
And your doctor.	Kwaye ugqirha wakho.
But that is exactly what he wants.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye ayifunayo.
But it is possible, of course.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka, kunjalo.
I do not believe in anything.	Andikholelwa kuyo nantoni na.
He knew he would have to agree.	Wayesazi ukuba kuza kufuneka avume.
But that will come later.	Kodwa oko kuza kamva.
I will definitely.	Ndiza kuphinda ngokuqinisekileyo.
He plays the piano and goes to college.	Udlala ipiyano kwaye uya ekholejini.
This seems obvious.	Oku kubonakala kucacile.
We all need to do the same.	Sonke kufuneka senze njalo.
Don't wait.	Musa ukulinda.
This becomes your job.	Oku kuba ngumsebenzi wakho.
I think of him everywhere.	Ndicinga ngaye yonke indawo.
Most people will do just that.	Abantu abaninzi baya kukwenza oko.
Alcohol, food, books.	Utywala, ukutya, iincwadi.
I know there a little bit.	Ndiyazi apho kancinci.
I apologized to her.	Ndacela uxolo kuye.
Besides, being human is very difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, ukuba ngumntu kunzima kakhulu.
He should not go that way.	Akufunekanga ahambe ngolo hlobo.
Everyone wants you now.	Wonke umntu ufuna wena ngoku.
I think you really told me.	Ndicinga ukuba undixelele ngokwenene.
Maybe a few days.	Mhlawumbi iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Personally, he knew he had no chance.	Ngokwakhe, wayesazi ukuba akanalo ithuba.
Talking to me.	Ethetha nam.
I will do it now.	Ndiza kuyenza ngoku.
I did not speak to him after that.	Khange ndithethe naye emva koko.
We know you know.	Siyazi ukuba uyazi.
He would definitely get the word out soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kufumana ilizwi kungekudala.
This is not necessary here though.	Oku akuyomfuneko apha nangona.
I look at the house.	Ndijonge endlini.
It seems that everyone wants more money.	Kubonakala ngathi wonke umntu uhlala efuna imali eninzi.
But he did not tell her.	Kodwa akazange amxelele.
None of us can do much.	Akukho namnye kuthi ukwenza okuninzi.
I'm always really tired.	Ndihlala ndidiniwe nyani.
And he was talking, too.	Kwaye wayethetha, naye.
Another three days.	Ezinye iintsuku ezintathu.
He said he would do it.	Wathi uya kuyenza loo nto.
He will not return until morning.	Akayi kubuya kude kube kusasa.
Then look again.	Emva koko jonga kwakhona.
Her cat.	Ikati yakhe.
Too long working.	Ukusebenza ixesha elide kakhulu.
Now there was nobody there.	Ngoku kwakungekho mntu.
For you will be alone.	Ngokuba uya kuba wedwa.
Not a new book.	Hayi incwadi entsha.
I don't know if he is sleeping.	Andazi noba ulele na.
I'm not sure how it happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke njani.
But in the end, it will happen.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, kuya kwenzeka.
To him it seemed like a wait.	Kuye kwakubonakala ngathi ukulinda.
He lay down and died.	Walala phambili, wafa.
And then, forward.	Kwaye ke, phambili.
I didn't want to do it all again.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza yonke kwakhona.
He did not want to come.	Wayengafuni ukuza.
He built a place.	Wakha indawo.
I did not tell you the whole truth.	Andizange ndikuxelele yonke inyaniso.
Thank you for not doing it.	Enkosi kuba asizange siyenze.
Glad to see you, though.	Ndiyavuya ukubona, nangona kunjalo.
His own death.	Ukufa kwakhe ngokwakhe.
I can read fast.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda ngokukhawuleza.
I can't stay here with you.	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha nawe.
Finally, she told him.	Ekugqibeleni, wamxelela.
But, no.	Kodwa, hayi.
Just a strange thing.	Into nje engaqhelekanga.
He should have gone to work.	Bekufanele ukuba aye emsebenzini.
Now she really knows what she wants.	Ngoku uyayazi ngokwenene into ayifunayo.
Dad goes first.	Utata uhamba kuqala.
I'll talk to you.	Ndiza kuthetha kuwe.
Obviously, too late.	Ngokucacileyo, emva kwexesha kakhulu.
Please do your job.	Nceda wenze umsebenzi wakho.
To me, for sure.	Kum, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He sat next to me in prison.	Wahlala ecaleni kwam entolongweni.
I just asked him to come.	Ndacela nje ukuba eze.
Do not be alone.	Musa ukuba lapha wedwa.
Nobody wants to know.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukwazi.
And there is something wrong with her.	Kwaye kukho into engalunganga ngaye.
I know better, you know.	Ndiyazi ngcono, uyazi.
That is why we have done so badly.	Yiyo le nto senze kakubi kangaka.
Not now, probably not.	Hayi ngoku, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Our time now.	Ixesha lethu ngoku.
I'm sorry again.	Ndiyaxolisa kwakhona.
He ran there.	Wabaleka waya apho.
My mother didn't tell me anything about it.	Umama khange andixelele nto ngalonto.
That one, though.	Lowo, nangona kunjalo.
And no, he is not at all.	Kwaye hayi, akanjalo kwaphela.
because he is not, you must go.	kuba engekho, kufuneka uye khona.
Let me think about it for a few days.	Makhe ndicinge ngayo iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Thanks again today.	Enkosi kwakhona namhlanje.
You probably already know this.	Mhlawumbi sele ukwazi oku.
You go to school and do something for you.	Uya esikolweni kwaye wenze into ngawe.
You can do that well.	Ungayenza kakuhle loo nto.
My wife, she has gone first.	Umfazi wam, uye wahamba kuqala.
Everyone and everything.	Wonke umntu nayo yonke into.
I know he doesn't have it.	Ndiyamazi ukuba akanalo.
Tired than you know.	Udiniwe kunokuba wazi.
I would like to go out.	Ndingathanda ukuphuma.
But it is very difficult now.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ngoku.
We had it very badly.	Sibe nayo kakubi kakhulu.
You know, too.	Uyazi, kwakhona.
I wonder here.	Ndiyazibuza apha.
But far, far away.	Kodwa kude, kude.
Doing this can be difficult.	Ukwenza oku kunokuba nzima.
I can't decide right now.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo ngoku.
He was terrified and asked to speak to me.	Wayesoyika kakhulu waza wacela ukuthetha nam.
What a place to stay.	Yeyiphi indawo yokuhlala.
And good anger.	Nomsindo olungileyo.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela.
I know you better than you think.	Ndikwazi ngcono kunokuba ucinga.
The woman is not down.	Umfazi akakho phantsi.
No, you can't think.	Hayi, awukwazi ukucinga.
No, something he would really like.	Hayi, into angathanda ngokwenene.
You read your book all night.	Ufunda incwadi yakho ubusuku bonke.
Like, a lot of people.	Njengokuba, abantu abaninzi.
You will decide later.	Uya kuthatha isigqibo kamva.
He sat up in bed and lay down.	Wahlala ebhedini, walala.
I am excited to go to a new place.	Ndiyavuya ukuya kwindawo entsha.
I did not want him to succeed.	Ndandingafuni ukuba aphumelele.
I just want a gun.	Ndifuna nje umpu.
Everyone knows.	Wonke umntu uyakwazi.
I can swim.	Ndiyakwazi ukuqubha.
We both know it will never happen.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba soze yenzeke.
Maybe I shouldn’t have had it.	Mhlawumbi bekungafanelanga ndibe nayo.
But that's all.	Kodwa yiyo yonke loo nto.
He told me what was going on.	Undixelele ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I would like to do more.	Ndingathanda ukwenza ngakumbi.
If so, you did well.	Ukuba kunjalo, wenze kakuhle.
And you are not going either.	Kwaye nawe awuyi.
I'm not sure he did, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze njalo, nangona kunjalo.
This time he had nothing else.	Ngeli xesha wayengekho enye into.
Well done to you.	Wenze kakuhle wena.
He fell asleep in a strange way.	Walala ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
There was nothing before.	Kwakungekho nto ngaphambili.
He seemed to think so.	Wabonakala ucinga ukuba kunjalo.
I will not be.	andiyi kuba.
Not only that, but also.	Ayisiyiyo loo nto kuphela, nayo.
Three years is a long time.	Iminyaka emithathu lixesha elide.
You will see what will happen.	Uya kubona ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
And, he says, he got his voice.	Kwaye, uthi, wafumana ilizwi lakhe.
Shortly thereafter, he arrived.	Kungekudala emva koko wafika.
You know there is.	Uyazi ukuba kukho.
And with me.	Kwaye kunye nam.
But two weeks is a long time.	Kodwa iiveki ezimbini lixesha elide.
The doctor says it's okay to talk to you.	Ugqirha uthi kulungile ukuthetha nawe.
It looked as if he was going to go to prison.	Kwakubonakala ngathi uza kuya entolongweni.
Death would be sudden.	Ukufa bekuya kuba ngokukhawuleza.
But at night something happens.	Kodwa ebusuku kukho into eyenzekayo.
But again nothing.	Kodwa kwakhona akukho nto.
And now you, of course.	Kwaye ngoku wena, kunjalo.
The man behind him.	Umntu emva kwakhe.
I thought about him all the time.	Ndandicinga ngaye ngalo lonke ixesha.
Everyone will surely come.	Wonke umntu ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuza.
He wondered what he was going to do.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
At his age.	Ngeminyaka yakhe .
And in a good place.	Kwaye kwindawo elungileyo.
I'm just waiting there.	Ndilinde nje apho.
But, whatever.	Kodwa, nokuba yintoni na.
One would be fine.	Enye ingaba ilungile.
It also makes it easier for you.	Kwakhona kwenza kube lula kuwe.
You arrived late.	Ufike emva kwexesha.
Or at the beginning.	Okanye ekuqaleni.
So it seems at first glance.	Ngoko kubonakala ekuqaleni.
All of them, that's right.	Bonke, kunjalo.
The problem is, we didn't really know which one.	Ingxaki kukuba, asizange ngenene ukuba yeyiphi.
I might have said otherwise.	Inokuba ndithethe ngenye indlela.
He knew about it.	Wayesazi ngayo.
It could be now.	Inokuba ngoku.
Sorry, away from everything.	Uxolo, kude nayo yonke into.
Or so it is.	Okanye unjalo.
This is harder than it seems.	Oku kunzima kunokuba kubonakala.
He ran out of there.	Wabaleka waphuma apho.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi wayengekho kwaphela.
Or who.	Okanye ngubani.
But if you can't talk about it, you can't.	Kodwa ukuba awukwazi ukuthetha ngayo, awukwazi.
Then you will succeed.	Emva koko uya kuphumelela.
You know how this goes.	Uyazi ukuba kuhamba njani oku.
He did not know that it would happen.	Wayengazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Front or back.	Ngaphambili okanye ngasemva.
But you can't learn much from it.	Kodwa awukwazi ukufunda okuninzi kuyo.
I hope you will make a speech.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kwenza intetho.
That can be fun.	Oko kunokuba mnandi.
But there is something strange about him.	Kodwa kukho into engaqhelekanga ngaye.
Then he said he wanted to go.	Emva koko wathi ufuna ukuhamba.
It must have been him.	Kumele ukuba nguye.
And so do you.	Kwaye ngoko wena.
We are also in it.	Nathi ngaphakathi kuyo.
He stayed home all that time.	Wahlala ekhaya ngalo lonke elo xesha.
It just so happened that I stayed with him.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba ndihlale nam.
And, of course, that is possible.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, oko kunokwenzeka.
So he did.	Ngoko wenze.
Or to him.	Okanye kuye.
I want you to leave immediately.	Ndifuna uhambe ngokukhawuleza.
Any of us will be like that.	Nabani na kuthi uya kuba njalo.
And the more they get, the better.	Kwaye ngakumbi baya kuba ngcono.
And it really wasn’t.	Kwaye kwakungekho ngokwenene.
He knows more than you think he did.	Wazi ngaphezu kokuba ucinga ukuba wenza.
But you should not do this.	Kodwa akufanele uyenze le nto.
He left yesterday morning.	Uhambe ekuseni izolo .
Yeah, and a little bit.	Ewe, kwaye kancinci.
Maybe there was no reason.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho sizathu.
It will come to you.	Iza kuza kuwe.
We really want to know who did this.	Ngokwenene, sifuna ngamandla ukwazi ukuba ngubani owenze le nto.
This seemed to be going well.	Oku kwakubonakala kuhamba kakuhle.
If not today, sooner or later.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva.
Dad was very angry.	UTata waba nomsindo kakhulu.
Everyone sat down to eat.	Wonke umntu wahlala phantsi ukuze atye.
Really great thing.	Into enkulu ngokwenene .
Up, for now.	Phezulu, okwangoku.
Yes, it is for you.	Ewe, kukho kuwe.
And he did just that.	Wayenza ngaloo ndlela ke yonke lento.
It's good to be here with me.	Kulungile ukuba lapha kunye nam.
He wanted food, he wanted coffee.	Wayefuna ukutya, efuna ikofu.
I want this done.	Ndifuna yenziwe le nto.
John has arrived late.	UJohn uye wafika emva kwexesha.
Almost always, this should happen immediately.	Phantse rhoqo, oku kufuneka kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
We need a voice.	Sifuna ilizwi.
I heard something about that, too.	Ndeva into malunga naloo nto, nam.
Now this.	Ngoku oku.
Not just for me.	Akukho nje kum.
I didn’t know about one, though.	Ndandingazi ngenye, nangona kunjalo.
You want to try.	Ufuna ukuzama.
But now he is making a big mistake.	Kodwa ngoku wenza impazamo enkulu.
He did something.	Kukho into ayenzileyo.
He did not know what to do now.	Wayengazi ukuba kufuneka enze ntoni ngoku.
In front of him, up, behind him.	Phambi kwakhe, phezulu, emva kwakhe.
Whether he goes or not.	Ngaba uya okanye akayi.
I think you come to work with me.	Ndicinga ukuba uza emsebenzini kunye nam.
And he has to stop.	Kwaye kufuneka ayeke.
Not just in our house but everywhere.	Hayi nje endlwini yethu kodwa kuyo yonke indawo.
However, he must know.	Kodwa ke, kufuneka azi.
It's just a little true.	Yinyani nje kancinci.
I tried to see the room as much as possible.	Ndazama ukubona igumbi kangangoko.
Just tell me what I did.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ndenze ntoni.
Yes, that will be seen.	Ewe, oko kuya kubonakala.
He wanted more time, though.	Wayefuna ixesha elingakumbi, nangona kunjalo.
Tell me her problem.	Ndixelele ingxaki yakhe.
Really, but there.	Ngokwenene, kodwa apho.
I should not have thought so.	Akufunekanga ndicinge njalo.
Something else is happening, too, in the background.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo, nayo, ngasemva.
This is just a thing.	Le yinto nje.
You don't have to go with you.	Akufunekanga uhambe nawe.
I don't like it very much there.	Andiyithandi kakhulu apho.
It was clear, really.	Kwakucacile, ngokwenene.
There was no place for him.	Kwakungekho ndawo yakhe.
He stayed there all night.	Walala apho ubusuku bonke.
What does it mean, he wondered.	Kuthetha ntoni, wazibuza.
It's too far for someone to be me.	Kude kakhulu ukuba umntu abe ndim.
So, yes, the gun.	Ngoko, ewe, umpu.
And they will take up very little space.	Kwaye baya kuthatha indawo encinci kakhulu.
No one made a mistake.	Akukho mntu wenze impazamo.
You don't know what you're doing.	Awuyazi ukuba ingaba wenza ntoni.
Or a girl, in this case.	Okanye intombi, kule meko.
Today my mother is here.	Namhlanje umama ulapha.
Then go for help.	Emva koko uye kufuna uncedo.
There was no work at all.	Kwakungekho msebenzi kwaphela.
He returned to prison.	Wabuyela entolongweni.
He knew nothing at all.	Wayengazi nto kwaphela.
But he will not do it.	Kodwa akayi kuyenza.
However, you will not get anything.	Nangona kunjalo, awuyi kufumana nto.
Not all at once, of course.	Akunjalo konke ngexesha elinye, kunjalo.
We know, we know, we know.	Siyazi, siyazi, siyazi.
I don't know if it is.	Andazi ukuba yiyo.
You know all this.	Konke oku uyayazi.
He walks alone.	Uhamba wedwa.
If I don't like you, I don't like you.	Ukuba andikuthandi, andikuthandi.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo kunye nayo yonke loo nto.
But you think the wrong way.	Kodwa ucinga ngayo ngendlela engalunganga.
I made a way.	Ndenze indlela.
I'm tired!.	Ndidiniwe!.
He became my friend.	Waba ngumhlobo wam.
It's ready.	Sele ilungile.
I went well.	Ndihambe kakuhle.
I live here every day.	Ndihlala apha yonke imihla.
I don't have to do it! 	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndiyenze!
Fast, but really.	Ngokukhawuleza, kodwa ngokwenene.
That means you have money.	Oko kuthetha ukuba unayo imali.
He too has slept like that.	Naye uye walala enjalo.
You told me everything about yourself.	Undixelele yonke into ngawe.
But he could not say anything else.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuthetha enye into.
One more thing.	Into enye kwakhona.
But all the way there is nothing.	Kodwa yonke indlela akukho nto.
We have not done so well.	Zange senze kakuhle ngolu hlobo.
But we have to go a little further.	Kodwa kufuneka siye phambili kancinci.
He wants to come here.	Ufuna ukuza apha.
Lots of flowers.	Iintyatyambo ezininzi.
She works at home.	Usebenza ekhaya.
There have been mistakes.	Kuye kwakho iimpazamo.
You are looking for number one.	Ujonge inombolo enye.
Thinking about him.	Ukucinga ngaye.
Tell me things.	Ndixelele izinto.
Anything but him.	Nantoni na ngaphandle kwakhe.
We will talk about this.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto.
No, no beautiful.	Hayi, hayi mhle.
I'm sure they will do well.	Ndiqinisekile baya kwenza kakuhle.
His eyes are invisible.	Amehlo akhe akabonakali.
But in the end he went on.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waqhubeka.
Tomorrow, you will be nothing to me.	Ngomso, awuyi kuba yinto kum.
And then something very unusual happened.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
I made it easy.	Ndenze lula.
He would do nothing.	Wayengayi kwenza nto.
It seems like no one is looking for a job lately.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho mntu ufuna umsebenzi mva nje.
Certainly not now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi ngoku.
This is probably not necessary.	Oku mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko.
Then you will begin to see.	Emva koko uya kuqala ukubona.
But surely nothing will happen at all.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto iya kwenzeka konke konke.
No one told me all that time.	Akukho mntu wandixelela ngalo lonke elo xesha.
But then life happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka ubomi.
And no one ever asked.	Kwaye akukho mntu wakha wabuza.
I feel a little better.	Ndiziva ngcono kancinci.
He made my job difficult.	Wenza umsebenzi wam ube nzima.
But not you again.	Kodwa hayi wena kwakhona.
My mother, and all that.	Umama wam, nayo yonke loo nto.
And up again.	Kwaye phezulu kwakhona.
He went very hard yesterday.	Uhambe nzima kakhulu izolo.
I am the only one.	ndim ndedwa.
And much more out there.	Kwaye kakhulu ngaphandle.
I'm happy to play with him.	Ndiyavuya ukudlala ngaye.
It's hard to see outside.	Kunzima ukubona ngaphandle.
It's not easy being me.	Akukho lula ukuba ndim.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo ncam.
I'm leaving soon.	Ndiza kuhamba kwangoko.
New and new.	Entsha kwaye entsha.
And then, very much, his voice.	Kwaye ke, kakhulu, ilizwi lakhe.
This is probably better.	Oku mhlawumbi kungcono.
He certainly looked for a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wajonga indawo.
Just look at this.	Jonga nje oku.
He said he was going with you.	Wathi uhamba nawe.
He did his job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakhe.
It will be better for you.	Kuya kuba ngcono kuwe.
I hope you are.	Ndiyathemba ukuba unjalo.
I think he does.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayenza.
Then, last week, something similar happened.	Emva koko, kwiveki ephelileyo, kwenzeka into efanayo.
He knows about you.	Uyazi ngawe .
But there is nothing better than nothing.	Kodwa akukho ngcono kakhulu kunokuba akukho nto.
A nice little house.	Indlu encinci entle.
He did not seek his help from anyone.	Akazange afune uncedo lwakhe nabani na.
Just, what would happen if any of us had it.	Nje, kuya kwenzeka ntoni ukuba nabani na kuthi unayo.
He travels a lot of people.	Uhamba abantu kakhulu.
You want to succeed every day.	Ufuna ukuphumelela yonke imihla.
Maybe he, too.	Mhlawumbi naye, naye.
I'm just tired and tired.	Ndidiniwe nje kwaye ndidiniwe.
However, it will come.	Nangona kunjalo, iya kuza.
I wonder if they went there.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngaba baye apho.
We will try to do something.	Siza kuzama ukwenza into.
This time he arrived just in time.	Ngeli xesha wafika kanye ngexesha.
I will be in one place.	Ndiya kuba kwindawo enye.
I haven't thought about you at all until now.	Khange ndicinge ngawe kwaphela kude kube ngoku.
I'm trying to buy your life.	Ndizama ukuthenga ubomi bakho.
You know you have to.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka.
It's hard to find a mistake.	Kunzima ukufumana impazamo.
I will do it, if you like.	Ndiya kuyenza, ukuba uyathanda.
So again, he would need help.	Ngoko kwakhona, wayeza kufuna uncedo.
You have to go there again and again.	Kufuneka uye apho kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
But, then, so does she.	Kodwa, ngoko, kunjalo naye.
You are always busy.	Uhlala uxakekile.
Or somewhere, another time.	Okanye kwindawo ethile, elinye ixesha.
Everything is clear.	Konke kucacile.
You have something.	Unayo into.
It all happens together.	Konke kwenzeka kunye.
It is impossible to know if this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
But that is not here and it is not there.	Kodwa oko akukho apha kwaye akukho apho.
But he really did not.	Kodwa ngokwenene akenzanga.
We will see soon that this is not the case.	Siza kubona kungekudala ukuba oku akunjalo.
It will be wonderful to see everyone again.	Kuya kuba mnandi ukubona wonke umntu kwakhona.
He would do that.	Wayeza kwenza njalo.
I am very human.	Ndingumntu kakhulu.
I know who she is.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ngubani.
But he can't get out.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuphuma.
Probably not everyone.	Mhlawumbi hayi wonke umntu.
And much more that way, of course.	Kwaye okuninzi ngakumbi ngaloo ndlela, kunjalo.
He wants to know what there is to see.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba kukho ntoni ukubona.
He did not know exactly what he would do.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
And, as it happens, there is a way.	Kwaye, njengoko kwenzeka, kukho indlela.
But not you.	Kodwa hayi nawe.
He stayed that way for the rest of his life.	Wahlala enjalo ubomi bakhe bonke.
This will happen again.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
You do not have to say anything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe nto.
Maybe a woman.	Mhlawumbi umfazi.
I want to learn all about you.	Ndifuna ukufunda konke ngawe.
I don't even know how to talk to him.	Andazi nokuba ndithethe njani naye.
I will go for a long time.	Ndiza kuhamba ixesha elide.
But all of us.	Kodwa sonke sobabini.
There is work to be done first.	Kukho umsebenzi ekufuneka uze kuqala.
Probably no one knows why.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wazi ukuba kutheni kwakhona.
But for the rest of your life.	Kodwa ubomi bakho bonke.
Until then, he remains in prison.	Kude kube ngoko, uhlala entolongweni.
He fell asleep immediately.	Walala ngoko nangoko.
He will say nothing.	Akayi kuthetha nto.
Again, not always.	Kwakhona, akukho rhoqo.
He thought everyone did it.	Wayecinga ukuba wonke umntu wenze njalo.
And they said no.	Kwaye bathi hayi.
It's better there.	Kungcono apho.
What is your problem.	Yintoni ingxaki yakho.
Maybe you can control yourself.	Mhlawumbi uyakwazi ukuzibamba.
But there is a way to do it.	Kodwa kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
Everyone in the office knows it.	Wonke umntu eofisini uyayazi.
But he knew what it was.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
But maybe that's not the right way.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ayisiyiyo indlela elungileyo.
I can do it well.	Ndingayenza kakuhle.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi mna.
There is work and there is someone.	Kukho umsebenzi kwaye kukho umntu.
But it is my job to do all that.	Kodwa ngumsebenzi wam ukwenza yonke loo nto.
Go ahead.	Uye phambili.
He never spoke to me again.	Akazange aphinde athethe ngayo nam.
Now, when.	Ngoku, xa .
However, do not go too far.	Nangona kunjalo, musa ukuya kude kakhulu.
That's the person.	Ngumntu lowo.
But it will not last.	Kodwa akuyi kuhlala.
Something happened to us.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuthi.
My mother told me that.	Umama wandixelela lonto.
I haven’t seen him, though.	Andizange ndimbone, nangona kunjalo.
That's exactly right here.	Kunjalo kanye apha.
House.	Indlu .
Not a strange evil.	Hayi embi engaqhelekanga.
And that is my job.	Kwaye ngumsebenzi wam lowo.
Or, even.	Okanye, nokuba.
Back then, it seemed like a long time to me.	Emva phaya, kwakubonakala ngathi lixesha elide kum.
Please go there now.	Nceda uye apho ngoku.
We'll see how it goes today.	Siza kubona ukuba kuhamba njani namhlanje.
There you are, and you are right.	Nantso ke, kwaye ilungile.
No one knew for sure.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
You have a good time right now.	Unexesha elihle okwangoku.
Now look down.	Ngoku jonga phantsi.
I don't know what will happen to him.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
Maybe he would tell her.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kumxelela.
And success.	Kwaye ukuphumelela.
I never did it with him again.	Khange ndiphinde ndiyenze naye.
He told me it would get better.	Wandixelela ukuba kuya kuba ngcono.
And I don’t totally believe it all the time.	Kwaye andikholelwa ngokupheleleyo ngalo lonke ixesha.
Not the police.	Hayi amapolisa.
That's the way he wants it.	Yiloo ndlela afuna ngayo.
I will make it happen.	Ndiza kuyenza yenzeke.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Bekuya kuba yinto embi ukuyenza.
Not because you want to die.	Hayi kuba ufuna ukufa.
There are always these.	Kuhlala kukho ezi.
And just look.	Kwaye ujonge nje.
Just coffee.	Ikofu nje.
I'll take the gun.	Ndiza kuthatha umpu.
Death is one thing.	Ukufa yinto enye.
He would need help with that.	Wayeza kufuna uncedo kuloo nto.
I can be tall.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba mde.
So good .	Ilungile kakhulu .
It would have to be that way.	Bekuya kufuneka kube njalo.
You can't stay in the house all day.	Awukwazi ukuhlala endlwini imini yonke.
This is a great thing to do about anything.	Le yinto enkulu yokwenza malunga nantoni na.
We've traveled far enough.	Sihambe kude ngokwaneleyo.
He made a woman.	Wenza umfazi.
You need to know, here, what you look like.	Kufuneka uyazi, apha, ukuba ukhangeleka njani.
No one spoke to me.	Akukho mntu uthethe nam.
The fact that.	Inyaniso yokuba.
I am here to take your place.	Ndilapha ukuthatha indawo yakho.
He will do it in the evening.	Uya kuyenza ngokuhlwa.
But still, that's just fine.	Kodwa kunjalo, kulungile nje.
There is currently no money.	Okwangoku akukho mali.
Certainly too, too.	Ngokuqinisekileyo naye, naye.
But it would be difficult.	Kodwa bekuya kuba nzima.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga uyazi.
What then.	Yintoni na ke.
You do not know this place.	Awuyazi le ndawo.
Then he told me.	Emva koko wandixelela.
I suspect that to be true.	Ndiyarhana ukuba yinyani leyo.
Being inside you.	Ukuba ngaphakathi kuwe.
But you need to know all of this.	Kodwa kufuneka ukwazi konke oku.
She is very smart.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu .
Or maybe before that.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphambi koko.
He did not sit down.	Khange ahlale phantsi.
Soon you will be able to do that alone.	Kungekudala uza kuyenza loo nto wedwa.
Like, once and for all.	Njengokuba, kanye nini.
So yes, no.	Ngoko ewe, hayi.
Or wait for your daughter.	Okanye ulinde intombi yakho.
I don't want him to be too far away from the house today.	Andifuni abe kude kakhulu endlini namhlanje.
He did not, but he agreed.	Akazange, kodwa wavuma.
Not so much, when you think about it.	Hayi kakhulu, xa ucinga ngayo.
So much never.	Kakhulu zange.
We will do a great job.	Siya kwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
Have a long time.	Ngaba ixesha elide.
Not just this time! 	Hayi nje ngeli xesha!
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wenze njalo.
I wanted everything.	Ndandifuna yonke into.
It is, it is strange.	Yinto, yinto engaqhelekanga.
You never had it.	Awuzange ube nayo.
That will be ahead of time.	Oko kuya kuba ngaphambi kwexesha.
We're going to do it just up here.	Siza kuyenza apha phezulu nje.
Really good !.	Ilungile ngokwenene!.
You will see everyone again.	Uya kubona wonke umntu kwakhona.
That is true.	Ukuba yinyani leyo.
When he talks to her.	Xa ethetha naye.
It happened to me.	Kwenzeke kum.
Now you must be very sleepy.	Ngoku kumele ukuba ulele kakhulu.
No!' 	Hayi!'
Seeing my dog.	Ukubona inja yam.
We will be here for a week.	Siza kuba apha iveki.
And it should have been.	Kwaye bekufanele ukuba.
It's a little hard to talk about right now.	Kunzima kancinci ukuthetha ngoku.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into.
I hope you know what it means to me.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba kuthetha kangakanani kum.
He wants a debt.	Ufuna ityala.
Probably not that tall.	Mhlawumbi akakho mde kangako.
It all means the same thing.	Konke kuthetha into enye.
We have to be on top.	Sifanele sibe phezulu.
The only woman.	Umfazi yedwa.
But, all that in time.	Kodwa, konke oko ngexesha.
And he says, suddenly.	Kwaye uthi, ngokukhawuleza.
You do not have to say anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uthethe into.
And so it is.	Kwaye ke, kunjalo.
I do not want to go anywhere.	Andifuni uye ndawo.
Certainly, he did not speak.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange athethe.
It is so.	Kuba njalo.
That happened a lot.	Oko kwenzeka kakhulu.
No one is living alone.	Akukho mntu uhleli yedwa.
Then he looked at his phone.	Emva koko wajonga ifowuni yakhe.
He did not make it easy.	Akazange enze lula.
In it, you should have been with me again.	Kuyo, bekufanele ukuba ube nam kwakhona.
It's just, you know.	Yinto nje, uyazi.
She doesn't think you have it in her.	Akacingi ukuba unayo kuye.
Is there any other way to do this.	Ngaba kukho enye indlela yokwenza oku.
Don't go too far.	Musa ukuya kude kakhulu.
I don't have any.	Mna andinayo.
It must have been very difficult.	Kumele ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
No way, but there it is.	Akukho ndlela, kodwa nantso.
He just wanted to be away.	Wayefuna kuphela ukuba kude.
But it seemed to us.	Kodwa kwakubonakala ngathi.
Everyone wants that.	Wonke umntu ufuna loo nto.
There is really no way out of this.	Akukho ndlela ngenene kule nto.
I want you to be like me.	Ndingathanda ukuba ube njengam.
But we are not going.	Kodwa asiyi.
I do not know now.	Andazi nam ngoku.
Eventually, one or the other thing will happen.	Ekugqibeleni, into enye okanye enye iya kwenzeka.
Too many, he thought.	Abaninzi kakhulu, wacinga.
A nice restaurant in a nice place.	Indawo yokutyela entle kwindawo entle.
And look what he did with it.	Kwaye jonga into ayenzileyo ngayo.
It will all come to an end.	Konke kuya kuphela.
He went deeper into it.	Wangena ngakumbi kuyo.
Finally he says it's time.	Ekugqibeleni uthi lixesha.
Truth is all.	Inyaniso yiyo yonke.
Than you are than me.	Kunokuba wena kunam.
It is not what you really want to do.	Ayisiyiyo into ofuna ukuyenza ngokwenene.
I went with her to school.	Ndaya naye esikolweni.
I hope I am here more.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndilapha ngakumbi.
Not so obvious.	Hayi ngokucacileyo.
What happened to that.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngaloo nto.
You need to be a good friend.	Kufuneka ube ngumhlobo omkhulu.
Ready to read.	Ukulungele ukufunda.
You have to go though.	Kufuneka uhambe nangona kunjalo.
I know immediately everything.	Ndiyazi ngokukhawuleza yonke into.
Low but not out.	Phantsi kodwa hayi ngaphandle.
All of this happened very quickly.	Konke oku kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He didn't know if he wanted to know.	Wayengazi ukuba uyafuna na ukwazi.
In this case, he cannot drive.	Kule meko, akanakukwazi ukuqhuba.
Not just a little, but a lot.	Hayi nje kancinci, kodwa kakhulu.
You don't have to be that far away now.	Akufunekanga ube kude kangako ngoku.
I thought that was really good.	Ndandicinga ukuba oko kuhle ngokwenene.
She told me she was fine.	Uye wandixelela ukuba ulungile.
I just want to know and think.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi kwaye ucinga.
It is certainly a good thing to do.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
However there seems to be something wrong.	Nangona kunjalo kubonakala ngathi kukho into engalunganga.
Because now the problem.	Kuba ngoku ingxaki.
I want this today.	Ndifuna oku namhlanje.
Also money.	Kwakhona imali.
He wanted to do the work alone.	Wayefuna ukwenza umsebenzi wedwa.
You know this, of course.	Uyazi oku, kunjalo.
Nobody now.	Akukho mntu ngoku.
This one is right.	Lo ulungile.
Everyone works there.	Wonke umntu usebenza apho.
By this time, the call would have been much more advanced.	Ngeli xesha, umnxeba bekuya kuba phambili kakhulu.
He would get everything.	Wayeza kufumana yonke into.
It can be easy.	Inokuba lula.
It should also not happen.	Kwakhona akufanele kwenzeke.
I think it would be so.	Ndicinga ukuba bekuya kuba njalo.
He will have to know a little more.	Kuya kufuneka azi ngakumbi kancinci.
It is my job here.	Ngumsebenzi wam apha.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukwenjenjalo.
Now, of course, we know why.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, siyazi ukuba kutheni.
And one today.	Kwaye enye namhlanje.
As will be seen, however, this is not the case.	Njengoko kuya kubonakala, nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo.
We must have it.	Sifanele sibe nayo.
You will be great.	Uya kuba kakhulu.
Just, all right.	Nje, kulungile.
Don't stay here.	Musa ukuhlala apha.
I think he should do that.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka enze njalo.
It will be fun inside.	Kuya kuba mnandi ngaphakathi.
Not that it will happen.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
I have to look.	Kufuneka ndijonge .
But, he is here.	Kodwa, ulapha.
Wait for me.	Ndilinde.
I think that's what any of us really want.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto nabani na kuthi ayifunayo ngokwenene.
He wanted to do that, he understood.	Wayefuna ukuba enjenjalo, waqonda.
So, you know, just look.	Ke, uyazi, jonga nje.
I know we never did.	Ndiyazi ukuba asizange senze njalo.
Nothing in it now, though.	Akukho nto kuyo ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
He is also a little tired.	Kwakhona kancinci udiniwe.
I want to stay here in my house.	Ndifuna ukuhlala apha endlini yam.
And how little.	Kwaye kancinci kangakanani.
And he was still talking.	Kwaye nangoku wayethetha.
Please let me hear your name.	Nceda ndive igama lakho.
Slowly, yes.	Kancinci, ewe.
And the exit.	Kunye ukuphuma.
I'm going to have to be a car.	Kuza kufuneka ndibe imoto.
One is a man.	Omnye yindoda.
Or do something.	Okanye wenze into.
For that, thank you very much.	Ngaloo nto, enkosi kakhulu.
He was nowhere to be seen.	Wayengabonakali ndawo.
Now it only takes three weeks.	Ngoku kuthatha iiveki ezintathu kuphela.
It's all too far.	Konke kude kakhulu.
See how you do with it.	Ukubona ukuba uqhuba njani ngayo.
Well, you know why.	Ewe, uyazi ukuba kutheni.
One in the morning and one in the evening.	Enye ekuseni kwaye enye ngokuhlwa.
He went with us.	Wahamba kunye nathi.
John walks in the park.	UJohn uhamba epakini.
You may not be aware of this.	Usenokuba awuyazi le nto.
I love it, and will do it again soon.	Ndiyayithanda, kwaye iza kuyenza kwakhona kungekudala.
And he will never come here again.	Kwaye akasayi kuphinda eze apha.
So that's it.	Ngoko ke yinto.
So is she, too.	Unjalo ke, naye.
I did not want to die alone.	Ndandingafuni ukufa ndedwa.
Last night he fell asleep.	Phezolo uye walala.
You can only be your own person.	Unokuba ngumntu wakho kuphela.
I do not understand death.	Andiqondi ukufa.
So, you went well.	Ngoko, uhambe kakuhle.
Obviously, that did not happen.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akuzange kwenzeke.
And anyone else.	Kwaye nabani na omnye.
He did not know exactly where he was.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uphi.
He is completely determined.	Uzimisele ngokupheleleyo.
Mom came in.	Wangena uMama.
But we will do it one day.	Kodwa siza kuyenza ngenye imini.
I wanted something to happen to me.	Bendifuna kwenzeke into kum.
He will have to stop immediately.	Kuya kufuneka ayeke ngokukhawuleza.
It is a very new job for me.	Ngumsebenzi omtsha kakhulu kum.
Look, just look up.	Jonga, jonga phezulu nje.
I'm not sure how I reacted to this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
He fell asleep almost immediately.	Walala phantse kwangoko.
He would need time.	Wayeza kufuna ixesha.
All of this backlash did not happen.	Konke oku kubuya mva akuzange kwenzeke.
It's even more fun that way.	Kuba mnandi ngakumbi ngaloo ndlela.
I think they will be.	Ndicinga ukuba baya kuba.
This is exactly what happens in this case.	Le yinto eyenzekayo kule meko.
I want more friends.	Ndifuna abahlobo abaninzi.
Now there is another.	Ngoku kukho enye.
He died almost immediately.	Wafa phantse ngoko nangoko.
And he never had friends.	Kwaye akazange abe nabahlobo.
No there is not.	Hayi akukho.
You know right away.	Wazi ngokukhawuleza.
But only at the beginning.	Kodwa kuphela ekuqaleni.
Because it would make everyone think.	Kuba bekuya kwenza wonke umntu acinge .
You have done well so far.	Wenze kakuhle kude kube ngoku.
I always tell the truth.	Ndihlala ndithetha inyaniso.
He wasn't far away, or doing anything out of the ordinary.	Wayengekho kude, okanye enze nantoni na engaqhelekanga.
But again, he did what he wanted to do.	Kodwa kwakhona, wenza oko ufuna.
I will be with her soon.	Ndiza kuba naye kungekudala.
It can also be difficult to read.	Kwakhona kunokuba nzima ukufunda.
Whatever it is, it is made by you.	Nokuba yintoni na, yenziwe nguwe.
It seemed impossible.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
Call center.	Indawo yokwenza umnxeba.
It will come down.	Kuya kuza phantsi.
He looks just a little bit.	Ubonakala nje kancinci .
Or you heard about.	Okanye weva malunga.
I do not want her to stay with me.	Andifuni ahlale nam.
He wanted something big.	Wayefuna into enkulu.
His voice more.	Ilizwi lakhe ngakumbi.
You will be alone.	Uzakuba wedwa.
Your parents and you must decide.	Abazali bakho kunye nawe kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
I wonder.	Ndiyazibuza.
But that does not seem to be the case for me.	Kodwa kubonakala ukuba akunjalo kum.
As big as you like.	Enkulu njengoko uthanda.
All the work lies in you.	Wonke umsebenzi ulele kuwe.
I can’t stop thinking about being inside you.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngokuba ngaphakathi kuwe.
I was thinking about myself.	Bendicinga ngam.
All of this is seen only one day.	Konke oku kubonakala ngenye imini kuphela.
He does it himself.	Uyayenza ngokwakhe.
He wanted, too.	Wayefuna, kakhulu.
I don't see anything of her here at home.	Andiboni kwanto yakhe apha ekhaya.
It is very hard to find and hard to work with.	Kunzima kakhulu ukufumana kwaye kunzima ukusebenza.
He just wanted to help.	Wayefuna nje ukunceda.
And far more so.	Kwaye kude ngakumbi.
I had to think clearly.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngokucacileyo.
It wasn’t nearly enough, though.	Kwakungekho phantse ngokwaneleyo, nangona kunjalo.
Until then in prison with you.	Kude kube ngelo xesha entolongweni nawe.
You can do that, of course.	Ungayenza loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
She has received help.	Uye wafumana uncedo.
That really, really fast.	Oko ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
You are afraid of everything.	Uyoyika yonke into.
I live with it every day.	Ndihlala nayo yonke imihla.
So, yes.	Ngoko, ewe.
I'm not sure how anyone can be at this point.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba umntu unokuba njani ngeli xesha.
He was so scared.	Wayesoyika ngolo hlobo.
I want to be your friend and everything.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumhlobo wakho nayo yonke into.
Maybe you think you made a mistake.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba wenze impazamo.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka lonke ixesha.
Misconduct will take another.	Ukwenza kakubi kuya kuthatha enye.
It’s a job for sure.	Ngumsebenzi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He has to do it.	Kufuneka ayenze.
I could not meet him.	Andizange ndikwazi ukudibana naye.
Not who else, who is better.	Hayi ngubani omnye, ngubani ongcono.
I like that too.	Ndiyayithanda lonto nam.
We know it is.	Siyazi ukuba yiyo.
This should not be too difficult.	Oku akufuneki kube nzima kakhulu.
I want to be with you all the time.	Ndifuna ukuba nawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
We better go our own way.	Kungcono sihambe ngendlela yethu sonke.
You will not go with us.	Awuyi kuhamba nathi.
You do it as you go.	Uyayenza njengoko uhamba.
That obviously you want.	Oko kucacile ukuba uyafuna.
And be.	Kwaye ube.
But you have to do it now.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze ngoku.
This means that everything is going well.	Oku kuthetha ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle.
He has never been a great player.	Akazange abe ngumdlali omkhulu.
He knew he had to have it.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
Of course, this is not all here and there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oku akukho konke apha kwaye akukho apho.
But little by little.	Kodwa kancinci kancinci.
Well, he will.	Kulungile, uya kwenza.
It will be very fun.	Iza kuba mnandi kakhulu.
And that's a good thing, for sure.	Kwaye yinto entle leyo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Of course you have to do that.	Ewe kufuneka wenze njalo.
No, he is not here.	Hayi, akakho apha.
I try to do everything.	Ndizama ukwenza yonke into.
Everything was clear after that.	Konke kwakucacile emva koko.
So stop doing that.	Ngoko yeka ukwenza loo nto.
The encounter is very good.	Ukudibana kuhle kakhulu.
But do not stay too long.	Kodwa musa ukuhlala ixesha elide.
I looked around.	Ndijonge malunga.
I will create these soon.	Ndiza kudala ezi kungekudala.
And now, a lot is possible.	Kwaye ngoku, okuninzi kunokwenzeka.
You have to be determined.	Kufuneka uzimisele.
But you have everything.	Kodwa unayo yonke into.
Then he found his new place.	Emva koko wafumana indawo yakhe entsha.
But there is no need to do that.	Kodwa akukho mfuneko yokwenza oko.
For now, no problem.	Okwangoku, akukho ngxaki.
He was doing his thing.	Wayenza into yakhe.
It's a very good job.	Ngumsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
I could not wait that long.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ixesha elide kangako.
And not alone.	Kwaye hayi yedwa.
So, that never really happened.	Ngoko, oko akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene.
Now it will end soon.	Ngoku iza kuphela kungekudala.
That's what he looked like there.	Yile nto wayekhangeleka ngayo apho.
He asked me questions about me.	Wandibuza imibuzo ngam.
I heard in the house.	Ndeva endlini.
There was no place for me.	Kwakungekho ndawo yam.
I don’t know what this could be, though.	Andazi ukuba inokuba yintoni le, nangona kunjalo.
If so there is a problem with you.	Ukuba kunjalo kukho ingxaki yakho.
He tried to be a good friend.	Wazama ukuba ngumhlobo olungileyo.
I wish he knew then.	Akwaba wayesazi ngoko .
Yes, you may be right.	Ewe, usenokuba ulungile.
He's out of here.	Uye waphuma apha.
But only in my house.	Kodwa kuphela endlwini yam.
He said there was no money.	Wathi akukho mali.
You don't want to work in a bad place.	Awufuni ukusebenza kwindawo embi.
Once in the afternoon.	Kanye emva kwemini.
Or if anyone is thinking of doing it.	Okanye ukuba nabani na ucinga ukwenza.
Not now or anytime.	Hayi ngoku okanye nanini na.
But sooner or later it will happen again.	Kodwa kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
If you expect to succeed, you will succeed.	Ukuba ulindele ukuphumelela, uya kuphumelela.
It is impossible to imagine why.	Akunakwenzeka ukucinga ukuba kutheni.
But it's just one man.	Kodwa yindoda enye nje.
Immediately after that.	Kwangoko emva koko.
I can do it tomorrow afternoon.	Ndingayenza ngomso emva kwemini.
You have spoken ill of me.	Uthethe kakubi phandle.
Everything else.	Yonke enye enye into.
You need to know which one it is.	Kufuneka wazi ukuba yeyiphi.
But he is clearly visible.	Kodwa ubonakala ngokucacileyo.
He was afraid to do so.	Wayesoyika ukwenjenjalo.
They live outside.	Bahlala phandle.
I'm still not sure.	Andiqinisekanga nangoku.
Then he knew it was coming.	Emva koko wayesazi ukuba kuza.
I think we should do the same.	Ndicinga ukuba nathi kufuneka senze oko.
He stays with her all night.	Uhlala naye ubusuku bonke.
Do you know why that is so.	Ngaba uyazi ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
I live far from that place now.	Ndihlala kude naloo ndawo ngoku.
But she still doesn't like it.	Kodwa akakuthandi nangoku.
But only you and you.	Kodwa wena kunye nawe kuphela.
I told my mother.	Ndamxelela umama.
But nobody wanted to say anything about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nto ngaloo nto.
Doing so will not be easy.	Ukwenza oko akuyi kuba lula.
I hope all goes well for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle kuwe.
He thought he could never.	Wayecinga ukuba akanakuze.
Again, this takes a lot of time.	Kwakhona, oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
That obviously did not happen.	Oko ngokucacileyo akuzange kwenzeke.
It is therefore a matter of reading the message.	Yinto ke ngoko ukufunda umyalezo.
I have been thinking the same thing for a long time.	Ndikhe ndacinga into enye ixesha elide.
Again, he seemed strange.	Kwakhona, wabonakala engaqhelekanga.
I didn't say anything, though.	Andizange ndithethe nto, nangona kunjalo.
oh yeah! 	ewe!
too many.	abaninzi kakhulu.
He returned home.	Wabuyela ekhaya.
I can't do this again.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku kwakhona.
I myself have never heard of it.	Mna ngokwam andizange ndeva ngayo.
But you can't do that, really.	Kodwa awukwazi ukwenza oko, ngokwenene.
Well, everyone knows, as it were.	Ewe, wonke umntu uyazi, njengokuba kunjalo.
He wouldn't go all the way.	Wayengayi kuhamba yonke indlela.
However, do not do that.	Nokuba kunjalo, musa ukuyenza loo nto.
It must have been me.	Kumele ukuba ndim.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba .
If only everyone could have fun.	Ukuba nje wonke umntu unokuba mnandi.
Maybe he knew that something was going to happen to him.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka kuye.
He too went to prison.	Naye waya entolongweni.
But this time it is true.	Kodwa ngeli xesha yinyani.
He saw a gun.	Wabona umpu.
He did not know how long he had been sleeping.	Wayengazi ukuba ulele ixesha elingakanani.
Great piano.	Ipiyano enkulu.
Or maybe you like one.	Okanye mhlawumbi ungathanda enye.
Can't think why?	Awukwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni ?.
We had to make a good picture.	Kwafuneka senze umfanekiso omhle.
Well, or not.	Kakuhle, okanye hayi.
My dad is fine.	Utata wam ulungile.
Please say no.	Ndicela uthi hayi.
I went to our old house.	Ndiye ndaya endlini yethu endala.
You're a little tired.	Sele udiniwe kancinci.
He looks like this.	Ukhangeleka ngolu hlobo.
What are you doing with this.	Wenza ntoni ngale nto.
He did something good.	Wenza into entle.
I will not.	Andiyi .
You know, everything is fine.	Uyazi, yonke into ilungile.
But, give me a chance.	Kodwa, ndinike ithuba.
First .	Ekuqaleni .
However, it can be difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, kunokuba nzima.
I didn't know you knew.	Ndandingazi ukuba uyazi.
It's hard to find a way out of all this.	Kunzima ukufumana indlela kuyo yonke le nto.
Look at all this.	Jonga yonke le nto.
He seemed, that's why.	Wayebonakala, yiyo loo nto.
I'm not sure what it will do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kwenza ntoni na.
It doesn't have to be far.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kude.
He never did anyone else.	Akazange enze omnye umntu.
I thought it was okay why.	Ndacinga ukuba kulungile kutheni.
Not so for him, though.	Akunjalo kuye, nangona kunjalo.
Yes, we will be there soon.	Ewe, siza kuba lapho kungekudala.
Everyone plays all day.	Wonke umntu udlala imini yonke.
You just sit and stare at it all the time.	Uhleli nje kwaye ujonge ngalo lonke ixesha.
Everyone lives like that here.	Wonke umntu uhlala ngolo hlobo apha.
Before that, you really are good.	Ngaphambi koko, ngokwenene ulungile.
We know where we are going.	Siyazi apho siya khona.
No one gave me anything.	Akukho mntu wandinika nto.
He walks behind her.	Uhamba emva kwakhe.
Just the way you want it.	Kanye ngendlela ofuna ngayo.
Well, maybe a little at first.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kancinci ekuqaleni.
The bus will arrive early.	Ibhasi iza kufika kwangethuba apha.
And it really could be better this time.	Kwaye ngenene kunokuba ngcono ngeli xesha.
We just want you to know.	Sifuna nje ukuba wazi.
It all comes our way.	Konke kuza ngendlela yethu.
He didn't know what exactly it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
And what you need to do.	Kwaye yintoni ekufuneka uyenzile.
It’s not as easy as it seems, you know.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala, uyazi.
He had better stay there.	Kungcono ahlale apho.
I'm going to talk to her tonight.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngokuhlwanje.
I am also very happy for you.	Nam ndiyavuya kakhulu ngawe.
He found another bus.	Wafumana enye ibhasi.
Now there was nothing.	Ngoku kwakungekho nto.
At the moment, that is already very difficult.	Okwangoku, oko sele kunzima kakhulu.
To be better.	Ukuze ube ngcono.
He started talking to me the other day.	Waqalisa ukuthetha nam ngenye imini.
But he cannot or cannot.	Kodwa akakwazi okanye akakwazi.
And he is an old man.	Kwaye yindoda endala.
I am.	Mna ke .
I will have dinner.	Ndiza kufumana isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Yeah, that's really it.	Ewe, oko ngokwenene.
How bad it is.	Hayi indlela embi ngayo.
But that happens all the time, too.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha, kwakhona.
I don't want to do it.	Andifuni kuyenza.
But only if he wants to.	Kodwa kuphela xa efuna.
That would be really nice.	Oko bekuya kuba kuhle ngokwenene.
Not bad for it.	Hayi kakubi kuyo.
I do that here.	Ndenza lonto apha.
Marriage is like that.	Umtshato unjalo.
I can't find a way to do that.	Andikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza oko.
It can really be you.	Unokuba nguwe ngokwenene.
He did nothing about it.	Akazange enze nto ngayo.
I do not like to be angry.	Andikuthandi ukuba nomsindo.
You're talking about it now.	Uthetha ngayo ngoku.
What was he thinking? 	Wayecinga ntoni?
Maybe he would talk about it later.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
Not bad.	Hayi embi.
There are just people.	Kukho abantu nje.
It's not me, really.	Ayindim, ngokwenene.
I mean, that doesn't.	Ndiya kuthetha, oko akuyi.
And then some more.	Kwaye ke ezinye ngakumbi.
Well done to you.	Wenze kakuhle nawe.
They remain strange.	Ahlala engaqhelekanga.
Others, anyone but him.	Abanye, nabani na ngaphandle kwakhe.
I did not know this.	Bendingayazi mna lento.
But it is more painful to tell the truth.	Kodwa ukuthetha inyaniso kuya kuba buhlungu ngakumbi.
It just so happened to me that.	Kwenzeka nje kum ukuba.
There was no such person.	Kwakungekho mntu unjalo.
He would be better off without her.	Uya kuba ngcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
My mother said it was okay.	Umama uthe kulungile.
The mini will definitely last for years though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo i-mini iya kuhlala iminyaka nangona kunjalo.
Not so much, but old.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa mdala.
Now that will take all night.	Ngoku oko kuya kuthatha ubusuku bonke.
My father has done his best to succeed.	Utata uye wangena konke okusemandleni ukuba aphumelele.
But it will be easy to be hard.	Kodwa kuya kuba lula ukuba nzima.
He can't take a chance.	Akakwazi ukuthatha ithuba.
And that is very difficult for you.	Kwaye oko kunzima kakhulu kuwe.
And this.	Kwaye le nto.
For others, it may be hard work.	Abanye, usebenza nzima kuyo.
They are everywhere and nowhere.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo kwaye akukho ndawo.
I will be able to do this again.	Ndiza kuphinda ndikwazi ukuyenza le nto.
Not too much to stay there.	Akukho kakhulu ukuhlala apho.
No, that is not necessary.	Hayi, oko akuyomfuneko.
What do you think could be the problem?	Ucinga ukuba ingaba yintoni ingxaki.
Very good, too.	Kakuhle kakhulu, kwakhona.
However, she did not agree.	Nangona kunjalo, akazange avume.
Or all.	Okanye bonke.
He should have it for me.	Kufuneka abe nayo kum.
All in the beginning.	Bonke ekuqaleni.
No matter how hard it is.	Nokuba kunzima kangakanani na.
Not just the whole way.	Hayi nje kwaphela yonke indlela.
Are you retired?	Ngaba udla umhlala-phantsi.
You have a book.	Unayo incwadi.
One way is the same.	Enye indlela efanayo.
Clearly, she is beautiful.	Kucacile ukuba mhle.
This, perhaps, he said.	Oku, mhlawumbi, wathi.
Don't forget to eat something.	Ungalibali ukutya into.
There is no turning back from that.	Akukho kubuya kuloo nto.
You have a place.	Unayo indawo.
We also know exactly what needs to be done.	Kwakhona siyazi kakuhle into ekufuneka yenziwe.
He looked like us.	Wayekhangeleka ngathi .
No work at all.	Akukho msebenzi kwaphela.
Or it seemed at the time.	Okanye kwakubonakala ngelo xesha.
If there is time.	Ukuba kukho ixesha.
I think you need help.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna uncedo.
I can't decide that.	Andikwazi ukugqiba ngolo hlobo.
I thought there was something wrong with me.	Ndandicinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngam.
His wife wanted to get out.	Umfazi wakhe wayefuna ukuphuma.
I was thinking a lot about it, for sure.	Bendicinga kakhulu ngayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I can't wait to try this.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuzama oku.
It's okay to be a little late.	Kulungile ukuba late kancinci.
Everything to me.	Yonke into kum.
This happened many times.	Oku kwenzeka izihlandlo ezininzi.
Then she said she loved him.	Emva koko wathi uyamthanda.
I got to school early.	Ndifike kwangethuba esikolweni.
I wanted to die right away.	Ndandifuna ukufa ngoko nangoko.
It comes this way.	Iza ngale ndlela.
Her father had to get to work early.	Utata wakhe kwafuneka afike kwangethuba emsebenzini.
This, of course, is not the case.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
And now what, he wondered.	Kwaye ngoku yintoni, wazibuza.
You knew you knew.	Ubusazi ukuba uyazi.
He really did, a very good job at that.	Wenza ngokwenene, umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
That's it now.	Nantso ke ngoku.
Or even it will happen.	Okanye nokuba kuya kwenzeka.
Just sitting it seems so, just sitting.	Ukuhlala nje kubonakala ngathi kunjalo, ukuhlala nje.
I did not want anything bad to happen to him.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke into embi kakhulu kuye.
There was no money.	Kwakungekho mali.
He did well to die.	Wenza kakuhle ukufa.
I don't really know about him myself.	Andazi ncam ngaye mna.
And then to me.	Kwaye ke kum.
You have become something to me.	Ube into kum.
And, no.	Kwaye, hayi.
Yes, but how? 	Ewe, kodwa njani?
He looked hard.	Wajonga ngamandla .
I don't want you to do that.	Andifuni ukuba wenze loo nto.
This, not so much.	Lo, hayi kakhulu.
Coming out again.	Ukuphuma kwakhona.
Only three hours.	Iiyure ezintathu kuphela.
It takes a week.	Kuthatha iveki.
But outside.	Kodwa ngaphandle.
Yes, we will talk about it, but not now.	Ewe, siza kuthetha ngayo, kodwa hayi ngoku.
And too many.	Kwaye abaninzi kakhulu.
Then time.	Emva koko ixesha.
I did not see him at all in school.	Khange ndimbone kancinci esikolweni.
Stop doing this.	Yeka ukwenza oku.
Not for me though.	Hayi kum kodwa.
My father never spoke again.	Utata zange aphinde athethe.
And really playful.	Kwaye ngokwenene ukudlala.
And, of course, himself.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngokwakhe.
If they stay that long.	Ukuba bahlala ixesha elide kangako.
I think you better go.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono uhambe.
But it requires work.	Kodwa kufuna umsebenzi.
She told my mother last week.	Uxelele umama kwiveki ephelileyo.
Only better is better.	Kuphela ngcono kungcono.
What happens here, one mistake.	Kwenzeka ntoni apha, impazamo enye.
Death is always there.	Ukufa kuhlala kukho.
My problem is how.	Ingxaki yam kukuba njani.
I mean, look at that.	Ndithetha, jonga loo nto.
And that is certainly true.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani leyo.
There is a way to do it, you know.	Kukho indlela yokwenza, uyazi.
It's just that it's time.	Kuphela nje ukuba lixesha.
I have to do just that.	Ndifanele ndenze loo nto kanye.
Another big one.	Enye enkulu.
But in this case, there is absolutely nothing at all.	Kodwa kule meko, akukho nto ngokuqinisekileyo yonke into.
Oh children! 	Hayi abantwana!
I would like to talk to him only.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye kuphela.
This makes it even more difficult.	Oku kwenza kube nzima ngakumbi.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho nto .
He continued on it.	Waqhubeka kuyo.
But, frankly, it never was.	Kodwa, ngokucacileyo, akuzange kube njalo.
He's just sitting with me all the time.	Uhleli nje nam ngalo lonke ixesha.
Obviously you are doing well.	Ngokucacileyo uqhuba kakuhle.
And speech.	Kwaye intetho.
Someone has to tell the truth.	Kufuneka umntu athethe inyani.
But, he has gone out.	Kodwa, uye waphuma.
I'm talking to her.	Ndithetha naye.
Everything will continue.	Yonke into iya kuqhubeka.
I'm not sure how you feel about all of that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uziva njani ngayo yonke loo meko.
But clearly man.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo umntu.
And you told him what happened to me.	Kwaye umxelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni ngam.
Eventually he learned to drive.	Ekugqibeleni wafunda ukuqhuba.
We know about you.	Siyazi ngawe.
Yeah, just about everything.	Ewe, malunga nayo yonke into.
He did not tell anyone, however.	Akazange axelele mntu, nangona kunjalo.
You spend all your time reading.	Uchitha lonke ixesha lakho ufunda.
I wanted to find my story there.	Ndandifuna ukufumana ibali lam phaya.
No, we won't have it.	Hayi, asiyi kuba nayo.
And he never told the truth.	Kwaye akazange athethe inyaniso.
But not up here.	Kodwa hayi apha phezulu.
He wanted to help you.	Wayefuna ukukunceda.
Everyone in prison, of course.	Wonke umntu entolongweni, kunjalo.
We will come back to this.	Siza kubuya kule nto.
I look forward to meeting you soon !.	Ndijonge ukudibana nawe kungekudala!.
It would take a lot of his attention.	Bekuya kuthatha ingqalelo yakhe kakhulu.
He said this happened again and again.	Uthe oku kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I know he wanted a better answer.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayefuna impendulo engcono.
I don't want that to be tonight.	Andifuni ukuba kube njalo ngokuhlwanje.
I'm here to make my time.	Ndilapha ukwenza ixesha lam.
He's just trying to find his way.	Uzama nje ukufumana indlela yakhe.
It certainly seems he is not at home right now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi akakho ekhaya ngoku.
So do not hold back.	Ngoko musa ukuzibamba.
He will be old soon.	Uza kuba mdala kungekudala.
Probably not, then.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, emva koko.
What a week really.	Yintoni iveki ngokwenene.
Not without me.	Akukho ngaphandle kwam.
They came after me.	Baza emva kwam.
He wanted her to know that he could do this.	Wayefuna ukuba azi ukuba angayenza le nto.
Everyone has to go there.	Wonke umntu kufuneka aye apho.
One, but not another.	Enye, kodwa hayi enye.
Indeed, that is what happened.	Ngokwenene, oko kwenzeka.
I'm just here to do my job.	Ndilapha nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
He could not wait.	Akazange akwazi ukulinda.
He came, died, and went his way.	Weza, wafa umfazi, wemka.
Me, not someone else.	Mna, hayi omnye umntu.
Everyone is happy and tired.	Wonke umntu uyavuya kwaye udiniwe.
Is that it.	Ngaba yiloo nto.
To do my thing.	Ukwenza into yam.
If he can do it, you can do it too.	Ukuba angayenza, nawe ungayenza.
You have your own bus.	Unayo ibhasi yakho.
Not exactly a woman.	Hayi ncam umfazi.
I think it should be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kumele kube njalo.
I want to stop being angry.	Ndifuna ukuyeka ukuba nomsindo.
Help me get there !.	Ndincede ndifike apho!.
I hope we go with him.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kuhamba naye.
He did.	Wakwenza.
But he also said.	Kodwa naye wathi .
And one, and one, and one.	Kwaye enye, kwaye enye, kwaye enye.
I heard about him, by the way.	Ndeva ngaye, ngendlela.
Not for us, our story.	Hayi kuthi, ibali lethu.
My mother did not want to leave.	Umama akazange afune ukuhamba.
I learned many things from her.	Ndifunde izinto ezininzi kuye.
He heard the answer.	Weva impendulo.
But do not go too fast.	Kodwa musa ukuya apho ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe he didn't need to know.	Mhlawumbi kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba azi.
But he did not do anything alone.	Kodwa akenzanga nto yedwa.
You will have a hard time finding one.	Uya kuba nzima ukufumana enye.
That's it, though.	Nantso ke, nangona.
No one is good all the time.	Akukho mntu ulungile ngalo lonke ixesha.
Then the call.	Emva koko umnxeba.
And so it will be.	Kwaye ngoko kuya kuba njalo.
He works hard at it.	Usebenza nzima kuyo.
But there was no one there.	Kodwa kwakungekho namnye apho.
It just wouldn't fit.	Bekungafanelanga kwaphela.
Not now and probably not.	Hayi ngoku kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It wasn’t that easy, though.	Kwakungekho lula ngolo hlobo, nangona kunjalo.
To tell you the truth.	Ukuze ndikuxelele inyani .
All right, all right.	Kulungile, kulungile ke.
It has to be me.	Kufuneka abe ndim.
Not all the time, but it happens.	Hayi lonke ixesha, kodwa kwenzeka.
We should not do that, especially now.	Akufunekanga siyenze loo nto, ngakumbi ngoku.
He knows exactly what his name is.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba ngubani igama lakhe.
Please check to find one.	Nceda ujonge ukufumana enye.
I told you, I told you.	Ndikuxelele, ndikuxelele.
It would probably take more time.	Mhlawumbi bekuya kuthatha ixesha elingakumbi.
I think we should go.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka sihambe.
Then he shared.	Emva koko waba.
Too bad .	Kakubi kakhulu .
But now, the problem.	Kodwa ngoku, ingxaki.
Well almost everyone.	Kulungile phantse wonke umntu.
And there is a lot of truth in this.	Kwaye kukho inyaniso eninzi kule nto.
But you have to go with us now.	Kodwa kufuneka uhambe nathi ngoku.
I mean, not exactly.	Ndiya kuthetha, hayi ncam.
I did not want anyone to know the truth about me.	Ndandingafuni ukuba nabani na azi inyaniso ngam.
Everything will be better.	Konke kuya kuba ngcono.
One has to stop the way.	Umntu kufuneka ayeke indlela.
I look forward to meeting you there !.	Ndijonge ukudibana nawe apho!.
It seems like a long time ago.	Kubonakala ngathi kudala.
Tom is not going anywhere.	UTom akayi ndawo.
And to do it for him.	Kwaye ukwenza kuye.
That way, that way.	Ngaloo ndlela, ngaloo ndlela.
Okay thank you very much.	Kulungile enkosi kakhulu.
I didn't know you could do that.	Bendingazi ukuba ungayenza lonto.
So not much is happening.	Ngoko akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
This could be him.	Le inokuba nguye.
You do well though.	Wenza kakuhle kodwa.
And there's a lot to do here.	Kwaye kukho into eninzi yokwenza apha.
My father knows better.	Utata wazi kakuhle.
And then we'll talk.	Kwaye ke siza kuthetha.
That's what my mother did.	Wenze njalo umama.
See if you can do it.	Jonga ukuba ungayenza na.
I better stay home.	Kungcono ndihlale ekhaya.
But not at night, no.	Kodwa hayi ebusuku, hayi.
He can't sit down.	Akakwazi ukuhlala phantsi.
I learned a lot about that.	Ndifunde okuninzi ngaloo nto.
He would leave immediately.	Wayeza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Less reading.	Ukufunda kancinci.
Or maybe he never learned how.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange afunde ukuba njani.
This was not long ago.	Oku akuzange kube kudala.
Not everything, though.	Ayisiyiyo yonke into, nangona kunjalo.
He will have to do it now.	Kuya kufuneka ayenze ngoku.
I'm not sure what he was going to do with it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wayeza kwenza ntoni ngayo.
It means more than you will ever know.	Kuthetha ngaphezu kokuba uya kuze ukwazi.
He had to do something else.	Kwafuneka enze enye into.
It should be fun to go that way.	Kumele kube mnandi ukuhamba ngolo hlobo.
Yeah, he's fine, too.	Ewe, ulungile, naye.
I should be this way.	Ndifanele ukuba ngolu hlobo.
We both want the truth.	Sobabini sifuna inyaniso.
He did not want to die.	Akazange afune ukufa.
All the time at night.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ebusuku.
To the end.	Ukuya ekugqibeleni.
Something has to be done, now.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe, ngoku.
Thus, and.	Ngaloo ndlela, kwaye.
We want to do more to go together.	Sifuna ukwenza ngakumbi ukuhamba kunye.
He knew then.	Wayesazi ngelo xesha.
Everyone knew at that moment that there was a problem.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngelo xesha ukuba kukho ingxaki.
She probably never told me about her other daughter.	Inokuba akazange andixelele ngenye intombi yakhe.
Everyone wants their money.	Wonke umntu ufuna imali yakhe.
Not in time, of course.	Hayi ngexesha, kunjalo.
My mother .	Umama wam .
I think it is absolutely true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
He never talked about it.	Akazange athethe ngayo kwaphela.
I didn't think of anything in that.	Andizange ndicinge nantoni na kuloo nto.
Maybe something is me.	Mhlawumbi into ndim.
Her doctor says she should.	Ugqirha wakhe uthi ufanele.
Just because he is a good man.	Kuba nje yindoda entle le.
It was also not necessary.	Kwakhona kwakungeyomfuneko.
I have never said anything like that.	Zange ndithethe into enje.
I don't really know how it happened.	Andazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke njani.
And he does it himself.	Kwaye uyayenza ngokwakhe.
You can't get out of the house.	Awukwazi ukuphuma endlwini.
Not because of him but because of him.	Hayi ngenxa yakhe kodwa ngenxa yakhe.
He will do it one day.	Uza kuyenza ngenye imini.
He did not go home much.	Akazange agoduke kakhulu.
All the time now.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ngoku.
He does not want any of us to have it.	Akafuni namnye kuthi abe nayo.
He was the first in the area.	Waba ngowokuqala kuloo ndawo.
That's all you need to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ofuna ukuyenza.
I know what it will be like.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
I never went there myself.	Andizange ndiye apho mna.
No one expects to wait too long before.	Akukho mntu ulindele ukulinda ixesha elide ngaphambili.
There are many books out there.	Kukho iincwadi ezininzi phaya.
There is no later.	Akukho mva.
I'm not sure at all.	Andiqinisekanga kwaphela.
His music, to him.	Umculo wakhe, kuye.
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into .
You want to be a better person.	Ufuna ukuba ngumntu ongcono.
I wish it were so.	Ndingathanda ukuba kube njalo.
Well, not just you, all of us.	Ewe, hayi wena kuphela, sonke.
I look at everything.	Ndijonge yonke into.
And not just any money.	Kwaye hayi nje nayiphi na imali.
But you will not find your way.	Kodwa awuyi kufumana indlela yakho .
Because you also think you know everything.	Kuba kwakhona ucinga ukuba wazi yonke into.
I did just one thing.	Ndenza kanye into enye.
You know, it's good for him.	Uyazi, kulungile kuye.
You have to go! ' 	Kufuneka uhambe!'
You think fast.	Ucinga ngokukhawuleza.
Yes .	Ewe .
He doesn't have to do anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba enze nantoni na.
He asked for a quick decision.	Wacela isigqibo ngokukhawuleza.
That will do for me.	Oko kuya kwenza kum.
To tell you the truth, it is no better today.	Ukukuxelela inyani, akukho ngcono namhlanje.
You must have told the truth.	Umele ukuba uthethe inyaniso.
I hope you did it once or better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kanye okanye ngcono.
Your dad did, though.	Utata wakho wayenza, nangona kunjalo.
It has to be, of course.	Kumele kube njalo, kunjalo.
I want to see his response to you.	Ndifuna ukubona impendulo yakhe kuwe.
No one went with him.	Akukho mntu wahamba naye.
Nothing will do anything.	Akukho nto iya kwenza nantoni na.
It's one thing for sure.	Yinto enye ngokuqinisekileyo.
I wanted to go to prison.	Ndandifuna ukuya entolongweni.
He went to work early.	Waya emsebenzini kwangethuba.
He should definitely eat though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka atye nangona kunjalo.
He did not know where or why.	Wayengazi ukuba phi okanye kutheni.
Just the way you did now.	Kanye ngale ndlela wenze ngayo ngoku.
I'll talk to you again later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kwakhona kamva.
It would be good to make that happen.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukwenza oko kwenzeke.
It's as hard as you want.	Kunzima njengoko ufuna.
But the truth is strange.	Kodwa inyaniso yinto engaqhelekanga.
It seems to be our thing.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto yethu.
Everyone says the same thing.	Wonke umntu uthetha into enye.
You talk like that, too.	Uthetha ngolo hlobo, naye.
If not too much.	Ukuba akukho kakhulu enye.
I want you here too.	Ndifuna wena apha nam.
I do not know now.	Andazi ngoku .
You have to be angry.	Kufuneka ube nomsindo.
This is our first job.	Lo ngumsebenzi wethu wokuqala.
I have to be inside.	Kufuneka ndibe ngaphakathi.
We really need to talk about it.	Kufuneka ngokwenene ukuthetha ngayo.
I don't want it to happen at all.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke tu.
I did not see anyone.	Khange ndimbone mntu.
He agreed.	Wavuma ke.
That means everyone has to help.	Oko kuthetha ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka ancede.
Nobody knew anything about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto ngayo.
Well, you know all about it.	Ewe, uyazi konke malunga nayo.
Of course, that would be even more fun.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oko kuya kuba mnandi ngakumbi.
I deserve this.	Ndifanele oku.
He is lying on my bed.	Ulele ebhedini yam.
Probably always.	Mhlawumbi rhoqo.
But you have to wait for my story.	Kodwa kufuneka ulinde ibali lam.
Also, thank you very much for your time.	Kwakhona, enkosi kakhulu ngexesha lakho.
He fell asleep and thought badly.	Walala, wacinga kakubi.
You really do make my day.	Uyayenza ngokwenene imini yam.
Yes, it seems.	Ewe, kubonakala kunjalo.
You really work on it.	Usebenza ngokwenene kuyo.
I wonder if that is true.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yinyani na leyo.
Not just music though.	Hayi nje umculo nangona.
He knows only two.	Wazi ezimbini kuphela.
One for me.	Enye kum.
He was not alone in this.	Wayengekho yedwa kule nto.
I hope you can.	Ndiyathemba ukuba unokuba njalo.
All is well !!.	Konke kulungile !!.
And last night.	Kwaye phezolo .
And he works hard.	Kwaye usebenza nzima.
More like this, please.	Ngakumbi ngolu hlobo, nceda.
Clearly, he was thinking for a long time.	Kucacile ukuba wayecinga ixesha elide.
And he did not come alone.	Kwaye akazange eze yedwa.
He remained asleep.	Wahlala ulele.
It's just hard to live that far.	Kunzima nje ukuhlala kude kangaka.
Some things completely.	Ezinye izinto ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe, yes, a woman.	Mhlawumbi, ewe, umfazi.
Not just plain.	Hayi nje ngokucacileyo.
But even though that is difficult.	Kodwa nangona oko kunzima.
Please come home with us.	Nceda, uze nathi ekhaya.
There’s been a lot about it lately.	Kukho okuninzi malunga mva nje.
Clearly, the problem.	Ngokucacileyo, ingxaki.
Well you did.	Kulungile uyenzile.
If it wasn't.	Ukuba kwakungekho.
He stayed that way.	Wahlala kunjalo.
He thought of leaving.	Wacinga ukuhamba.
Nice to talk to you again.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha nawe kwakhona.
Go to it.	Iya kuyo.
For it is not so.	Ngokuba akunjalo.
He made a plan.	Wenza icebo.
Down there.	Phantsi phaya.
I mean in a big way.	Ndithetha ukuba ngendlela enkulu.
He would say something bad.	Wayeza kuthetha into embi.
But now, to think about it.	Kodwa ngoku, ukucinga ngayo.
And he said to me.	Wathi ke kum.
I would definitely like to get one soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingathanda ukufumana enye kwangoko.
His eyes.	Amehlo akhe .
But yes.	Kodwa ewe .
If you want to do it, you will try.	Ukuba ufuna ukuyenza, uya kuzama.
I need help, here.	Ndifuna uncedo, apha.
But not all the way.	Kodwa hayi yonke indlela.
But that is not the case right now.	Kodwa akunjalo okwangoku.
Now you want to get out.	Ngoku ufuna ukuphuma.
And you need to know why.	Kwaye kufuneka wazi ukuba kutheni.
He always makes it happen.	Uhlala esenza ukuba kwenzeke.
We will be with him.	Siza kuba naye.
He just can't tell.	Akakwazi nje ukuxelela.
Look at my father.	Jonga utata wam.
Then his mother.	Emva koko umama wakhe.
We will stay for a while.	Siza kuhlala kancinci.
There is a reason you are here.	Kukho isizathu sokuba ulapha.
And everyone knows who she is.	Kwaye wazi wonke umntu ukuba ngubani na.
I try everything.	Ndizama yonke into.
He leaves immediately afterwards.	Uhamba ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
I would have to go.	Bekuya kufuneka ndihambe.
I came here for work.	Ndize apha emsebenzini.
I want you to stay.	Ndifuna uhlale.
You just don't look like yourself.	Awubonakali nje wena.
Other things, of course.	Ezinye izinto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
My mistake in that.	Impazamo yam kuloo nto.
You will have it.	Uya kuba nayo.
That way, we need your help.	Ngaloo ndlela, sifuna uncedo lwakho.
Work can be fun.	Umsebenzi unokuba mnandi.
I love it when she does this.	Ndiyayithanda xa esenza oku.
Maybe he went alone.	Mhlawumbi wahamba yedwa.
It was not difficult to make a decision.	Akuzange kube nzima ukwenza isigqibo.
I think that goes with you.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuhamba nawe.
We are going there.	Siya phaya.
Please help if you know.	Ndicela uncedo ukuba uyazi.
I immediately decided to get the job done.	Ndagqiba ngoko nangoko ukwenza umsebenzi.
Then he saw a dog.	Emva koko wabona inja.
I wondered why.	Ndacinga ukuba kutheni.
He needs to know tomorrow.	Kufuneka azi ngomso.
We will be able to help.	Siza kukwazi ukunceda.
I don’t know how you learn to do that.	Andazi ukuba ufunda njani ukuyenza loo nto.
I hope you can do it, too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza, nawe.
Very good way.	Indlela entle kakhulu.
I will have to learn from it.	Kuya kufuneka ndifunde kuyo.
And then he has gone too far.	Kwaye ke uye wahamba kakhulu.
It would seem that he is not.	Kuya kubonakala ukuba akunjalo.
The little talk is.	Intetho encinci yiyo.
It happened this week.	Kwenzeke kule veki .
Again a case.	Kwakhona ityala.
I think you should meet him.	Ndicinga ukuba ufanele ukudibana naye.
Certainly not now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo ngoku.
And then something went wrong.	Kwaye ke kukho into engalunganga.
Well, maybe it's better this way.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
You will need to know about this.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ngale nto.
He was not successful enough for me.	Akazange aphumelele ngokwaneleyo kum.
And he knows his problem.	Kwaye uyayazi ingxaki yakhe.
You may have noticed.	Usenokuba waqonda.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngayo.
I thought of some.	Ndacinga ezinye.
You do not have to do this for real.	Akufunekanga wenze oku ngenene.
I did all that.	Ndenze yonke loo nto.
Then his first doctor retired.	Emva koko ugqirha wakhe wokuqala wathatha umhlala-phantsi.
Before that.	Ngaphambi koko.
I've never heard of him.	Nam andizange ndive ngaye.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
It will not be fun.	Awuyi kuba mnandi.
Well, that's fine for me.	Ewe, kulungile kum.
I know how it will end.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuphela njani.
I thought better of it.	Ndacinga ngcono ngayo.
But everything happened so quickly.	Kodwa yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
But for now, he knew nothing.	Kodwa okwangoku, wayengazi ndawo.
And when.	Kwaye xa .
Flowers.	Iintyatyambo .
It will be easier to meet there.	Kuya kuba lula ukudibana apho.
We did a great job with that.	Senze umsebenzi omhle ngaloo nto.
He knew he would not.	Wayesazi ukuba akasayi.
So my wife wanted to go out again.	Ngoko umfazi wam wayefuna ukuphuma kwakhona.
I just do this.	Ndenza nje oku.
Sitting in the back.	Ukuhlala ngasemva.
I had never heard of him before, though.	Andizange ndive ngaye ngaphambili, nangona kunjalo.
Check up!.	Jonga!.
Two, three days.	Iintsuku ezimbini, ezintathu.
Or it seems to me.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi kum.
I never heard of that.	Khange ndive ngalonto.
I hope you will make it happen.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuyenza yenzeke.
You have to go with him.	Kufuneka uhambe naye.
This, of course, is not necessary.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunyanzelekanga.
But everyone knows that now.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyazi ukuba ngoku.
What do we have to do.	Kufuneka senze ntoni.
He told her only once.	Wamxelela ukuba kube kanye kuphela.
No, not at all for me.	Hayi, akunjalo kum.
He would eat something later.	Wayeza kutya into kamva.
Some say that it is.	Abanye bathi ilungile nje.
You can do that tonight.	Ungayenza loo nto ngokuhlwanje.
I don't see anyone but.	Andiboni mntu kodwa.
So, until the future, everyone.	Ngoko, kude kube lixesha elizayo, wonke umntu.
It will come to all of us.	Iza kuthi sonke.
He is not at the top of it.	Akakho phezulu kuyo.
One day sooner or later.	Ngenye imini kungekudala okanye kamva.
I hope it never happens again.	Ndiyathemba ukuba asiyi kuphinda yenzeke.
I want something.	Ndifuna into .
I can make it happen.	Ndingayenza yenzeke.
In that place, of course.	Kuloo ndawo, kunjalo.
But it has to be this way.	Kodwa kufuneka kube ngolu hlobo.
Or anything bad.	Okanye nantoni na embi.
You will get a new job.	Uya kufumana umsebenzi omtsha.
Time for her to know.	Ixesha lokuba azi.
I can't drive a car.	Andikwazi ukuqhuba imoto.
I think everyone wants a good job.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu ufuna umsebenzi olungileyo.
At first, all the good time.	Ekuqaleni, lonke ixesha elihle.
It will be difficult to drive.	Kuya kuba nzima ukuqhuba.
And it didn't take long.	Kwaye akuzange kube ixesha elide.
There is not much space in the car though.	Akukho ndawo ingako emotweni kunjalo.
If you have logged in, we will get a picture.	Ukuba uye wangena, siya kufumana umfanekiso.
What are you going to do.	Yintoni oza kuyenza.
I do not believe it will happen.	Andikholelwa ukuba iya kwenzeka.
He hoped it would always be that way.	Wayenethemba lokuba kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
One took his own life.	Omnye wathatha ubomi bakhe.
And there is the problem.	Kwaye apho kukho ingxaki.
Tall, too.	Mde, naye.
Not what.	Hayi yintoni.
Every day you do something for me.	Yonke imihla wenza into ngam.
Or for a lifetime.	Okanye ubomi bonke.
Everyone wanted to work with him.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukusebenza naye.
But he was right.	Kodwa wayethetha inyaniso.
Or a woman.	Okanye umfazi.
This is a very good thing.	Le yinto entle kakhulu.
He got better.	Waba ngcono.
It takes two.	Kuthatha ezimbini.
It was not hard to find.	Kwakungekho nzima ukufumana.
It's clear at night.	Kucacile ebusuku.
I have seen too many.	Ndibone ezininzi kakhulu.
She was terribly scared.	Wayesoyika ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
Maybe, he's asleep.	Mhlawumbi, ulele.
He started living with us.	Waqalisa ukuhlala nathi.
One day it is possible.	Ngenye imini kunokwenzeka.
It is good to know that it is.	Kuhle ukwazi ukuba kunjalo.
I would love to be with her.	Ndingathanda ukuba naye .
My father did something strange.	Utata wenza into engaqhelekanga.
I do not go to class.	Andiyi eklasini.
He didn't even know it was true.	Wayengazi nokuba yinyani na.
Not in your house, though.	Hayi endlwini yakho, nangona kunjalo.
Although he talks about you.	Nangona ethetha ngawe.
He was never angry, only that.	Akazange abe nomsindo, kuphela nokuba.
And he never did.	Kwaye akazange aphinde.
Going to prison.	Ukuya entolongweni.
Buying a house.	Ukuthenga indlu.
But there! 	Kodwa apho!
Totally alone.	Ngokupheleleyo yedwa.
Do you have any.	Ngaba unayo nayiphi na .
But no one should know.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufanele ukwazi.
I love it once.	Ndiyayithanda kanye.
Now you can succeed.	Ngoku uyakwazi ukuphumelela.
If you do this.	Ukuba wenza oku.
That will make the question much easier.	Oko kuya kwenza lo mbuzo ube lula kakhulu.
Either way, you will be better off.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, uya kuba ngcono kuyo.
I only saw one mistake in the whole book.	Ndibone impazamo enye kuphela kuyo yonke incwadi.
Probably not .	Mhlawumbi akunjalo .
You gave it to me.	Wandinika wena.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele .
And look up.	Kwaye jonga phezulu.
I haven't had it yet.	Andizange ndibe nayo nangona kunjalo.
By the way, lunch.	Ngendlela, isidlo sasemini.
They both live in the area.	Bobabini bahlala kwindawo.
I'll be there now.	Ndiya kuba lapho ngoku.
It will be a small thing.	Kuya kuba yinto encinci.
So, he wanted to be with her.	Ngoko ke, wayefuna ukuba naye.
Look at the people.	Ujonge abantu.
Probably nothing happened.	Mhlawumbi akuzange kwenzeke nto.
I can't stop telling you more.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukukuxelela ngakumbi.
It has to be right.	Kufuneka ilungile.
He can never know for sure.	Akanakuze azi ngokupheleleyo.
But he gave me some.	Kodwa wandinika ezinye.
He would tell her where to go.	Wayeza kumxelela ukuba aye phi.
Alone, one can be alone.	Eyedwa, umntu unokuba nguye yedwa.
This becomes a very small thing, however.	Oku kuba yinto encinci kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I think you should talk to her.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono uthethe naye.
I will get my answer soon.	Ndiza kufumana impendulo yam kungekudala.
And there really is another way.	Kwaye ngokwenene kukho enye indlela.
I did not know where I was going.	Bendingazi noba ndiye phi.
One way, another car.	Enye indlela, enye imoto.
Sorry, that 's not easy to say.	Uxolo, akukho lula ukuyithetha.
And you just told me.	Kwaye undixelele nje.
Then he went down to work.	Waza wehla waya emsebenzini.
You probably do.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba uyayenza.
You will speak well.	Uya kuthetha kakuhle.
But that's what you're going to do anyway.	Kodwa leyo yinto oza kuyenza nangona kunjalo.
No one was looking at the dog.	Kwakungekho mntu ujonge inja.
Yes, almost all of them.	Ewe, phantse yonke.
They will be here soon.	Baza kuba lapha kungekudala.
He looked like that.	Wayebonakala ngaloo ndlela.
I did not want to be.	Ndandingafuni ukuba njalo.
But now, at last, he understood.	Kodwa ngoku, ekugqibeleni, waqonda.
They will do the same to you.	Baya kuyenza loo nto kuwe.
It would be good for me.	Bekuya kuba kuhle kum.
He is doing what needs to be done.	Uyayenza into ekufuneka yenziwe.
What did he do next?	Wenza ntoni emva koko.
And this happened to me.	Kwaye kwenzeka oku kum.
Not far from here.	Hayi kude apha.
New in town.	Entsha edolophini.
But he did not want to go to it.	Kodwa akazange afune ukuya kuyo.
And look out.	Kwaye ujonge ngaphandle.
He is often present.	Udla ngokuba khona.
He wanted to go home.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya.
I don't have time, really.	Andinaxesha, nyani.
Or my food.	Okanye ukutya kwam.
He wants everyone to come to his place.	Ufuna wonke umntu eze kwindawo yakhe.
I know you are a good person.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
I wanted to go with him.	Ndandifuna ukuhamba naye.
Everything, the car.	Yonke into, imoto.
Then look here.	Jonga ke apha.
I did very well, too.	Ndenze kakuhle kakhulu, nam.
I think you already know.	Ndicinga ukuba sele uyazi.
I never went there either.	Nam andizange ndiye apho.
And don't forget what happened here today.	Kwaye ungalibali ukuba kwenzeke ntoni apha namhlanje.
I don't really know how to sing.	Andazi nyani ukucula.
And, of course, that's it.	Kwaye, kunjalo, yiloo nto.
Another strange thing for me.	Enye into engaqhelekanga yam.
You will definitely be there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba lapho.
You will have to do your homework.	Kuya kufuneka wenze umsebenzi wasekhaya.
No he did not.	Hayi akenzanga.
Mom, of course.	Umama, kunjalo.
I'll stay there, up.	Ndiya kuhlala apho, phezulu.
I have to talk to him for a long time.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ixesha elide.
Better this way.	Ngcono ngale ndlela.
But his name.	Kodwa igama lakhe.
Yes, you came last night.	Ewe, ufike phezolo.
I think that's for sure.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
I'm not very good at this.	Andikho mhle kakhulu kule nto.
You want to do this.	Uyafuna ukwenza oku.
Not just once, you know.	Hayi nje kube kanye, uyazi.
I don't even know where you went.	Andazi nokuba uye phi.
That seems to be coming back.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kubuya ngasemva.
I never told her that.	Khange ndimxelele lonto.
Yes, not all my life.	Ewe, hayi ubomi bam bonke.
Hope to see you soon!!!!.	Ndinqwenela ukubona!!!!.
You will not see it.	Awuyi kubona.
Maybe they have.	Mhlawumbi baye.
Probably before that.	Mhlawumbi ngaphambi koko.
He will just continue to get better.	Uza kuqhubeka nje ukuba ngcono.
He talked for a long time with her.	Wathetha ixesha elide naye.
Don't think about it again.	Musa ukucinga ngayo kwakhona.
Here, now.	Apha, ngoku.
I think that's all.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
Look at my daughter.	Jonga intombi yam.
Slightly at first, and very fast.	Kancinci ekuqaleni, kwaye ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I'm starting to see clearly now.	Ndiyaqala ngoku ukubona ngokucacileyo.
I know you know that.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyakwazi oko.
I heard the piano, too.	Ndeva ipiyano, nam.
One day he left.	Ngenye imini wahamba.
We could have done better now.	Inokuba senze ngcono ngoku.
It is better to do a lot of time.	Kungcono ukwenza ixesha elininzi.
Look at the picture.	Jonga umfanekiso .
I was just hoping.	Bendinethemba nje.
It needs to be done, maybe.	Kufuneka yenziwe, mhlawumbi.
I hope he will stay with you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala nawe.
If so, my apologies.	Ukuba kunjalo, uxolo lwam.
However, we know what it could be like there.	Nangona kunjalo, siyazi ukuba inokuba njani phaya.
It would be fast.	Bekuya kuba ngokukhawuleza.
function.	umsebenzi.
There’s no reason why, really.	Akukho sizathu sokuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
Maybe no time, no.	Mhlawumbi akukho xesha, hayi.
He was making money.	Wayenza imali.
He did not want me to be a doctor.	Wayengafuni ndibe ngugqirha.
Maybe then it would end.	Mhlawumbi emva koko bekuya kuphela.
Maybe he wanted it to be so.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna kube njalo.
I want my mother.	Ndifuna umama wam.
No one wanted to talk.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha.
What you have to stay with.	Yintoni into ekufuneka uhlale nayo.
Everyone else just stared.	Wonke omnye umntu ujonge nje.
Yes, this will mean you.	Ewe, oku kuya kuthetha wena.
My beautiful mother.	Umama wam omhle.
What happened.	Yintoni into eyenzekayo.
Nothing, too.	Akukho nto, kwakhona.
He just sits all day.	Uhleli nje imini yonke.
Maybe just another two weeks.	Mhlawumbi ezinye iiveki nje ezimbini.
My father said he thought that was the right thing to do.	Utata wathi wayecinga ukuba ilungile loo nto.
But one, yes.	Kodwa enye, ewe.
Maybe he's better though.	Mhlawumbi ungcono nangona kunjalo.
I want to talk to anyone.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nabani na.
Long wait.	Ukulinda ixesha elide.
But this makes it so.	Kodwa oku kwenza ukuba kube njalo.
It is better to know.	Kungcono ukwazi.
You will buy again.	Uya kuthenga kwakhona.
But he will come to me.	Kodwa uya kuza kum.
It would be fun to play.	Bekuya kuba mnandi ukudlala.
And he will not go.	Kwaye akayi kuhamba.
One, he thought.	Enye, wacinga.
We have to do it because it is right.	Kufuneka siyenze kuba ilungile.
I know what's coming with me.	Ndiyayazi into ezayo nam.
He wanted to come very badly.	Wayefuna ukuza kakubi kakhulu.
Nice toy.	Into yokudlala entle.
So you have to be honest.	Ngoko kufuneka uthethe inyani.
He never spoke to her again.	Zange aphinde athethe naye.
Really nice thing.	Into entle ngokwenene.
And so it is not necessary.	Kwaye ngoko akuyomfuneko.
Any of that.	Nayiphi na loo nto.
There is no danger, and you know it now.	Akukho ngozi, kwaye uyazi ngoku.
There is nothing there.	Akukho kwanto apho.
Hats off and well dressed.	Umnqwazi kwaye unxibe kakuhle.
I told her later.	Ndimxelele emva koko.
Maybe you think it’s a toy.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba yinto yokudlala.
More room inside.	Igumbi elingakumbi ngaphakathi.
I'll go now, he thought.	Ndiza kuhamba ngoku, wacinga.
But yes the answer.	Kodwa ewe impendulo.
All right my dad.	Kulungile utata wam.
There was nothing out there.	Kwakungekho nto apha phandle.
He got out of the car.	Waphuma emotweni.
He did not stay with me for dinner.	Khange ahlale nam isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Because of that.	Ngenxa enjalo.
You, of course, know that.	Wena, kunjalo, uyayazi loo nto.
No .	Hayi .
It was absolutely not necessary for anyone.	Kwakungeyomfuneko kwaphela kuye nabani na.
We want a bigger space.	Sifuna indawo enkulu.
He seems optimistic about everything, though.	Ubonakala unethemba ngayo yonke into, nangona kunjalo.
But he just did it a little way.	Kodwa wenza nje indlela encinci.
He didn't really want to.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene.
And it could be me.	Kwaye inokuba ndim.
I made a mistake, back there.	Ndenze impazamo, phaya emva.
To do these this week.	Ukwenza ezi kule veki.
Not now, he thought.	Hayi ngoku, wacinga.
That is my only job.	Ngumsebenzi wam kuphela lowo.
It will be soon.	Iza kuba kungekudala.
I want to do something.	Ndifuna ukwenza into.
We will get everything.	Siza kufumana yonke into.
But everyone looked away.	Kodwa wonke umntu wajonga ecaleni.
Or maybe he wasn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayengekho.
After that, he wanted to do it every day.	Emva koko, wayefuna ukwenza yonke imihla.
He left today.	Uhambe namhlanje.
There was no way to be real.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokuba yinyani.
Not today, not next week.	Hayi namhlanje, hayi kwiveki ezayo.
I think the same is true now.	Ndicinga ukuba kunjalo nangoku.
I like my car.	Ndiyayithanda imoto yam.
Not just this one.	Hayi nje kule.
But if you have it.	Kodwa ukuba unayo.
I think he also knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba naye uyayazi loo nto.
He refused and fled.	Akazange avume, wabaleka.
He doesn't know what to do.	Akayazi into amakayenze.
I can tell that.	Ndiyakwazi ukuxelela ukuba .
You will eat anything.	Uza kutya nantoni na.
He would say many things.	Wayeza kuthetha izinto ezininzi.
Nobody will ever talk about it.	Akukho mntu uya kuze athethe ngayo.
So it will be very difficult.	Ngoko kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
It's hard but once you know, you're fine.	Kunzima kodwa xa sele uyazi, ulungile.
Thank you so much everyone.	Enkosi kakhulu wonke umntu.
You will be very sad.	Uya kuba buhlungu kakhulu.
And he does it again.	Kwaye uyenza kwakhona.
I had no idea how we were going to do it.	Ndandingazi ukuba siza kuyenza njani.
He knew it was all right, this time.	Wayesazi ukuba konke kulungile, ngeli xesha.
Nice place, he thought.	Indawo entle, wacinga.
You know something is happening.	Uyazi ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
You do it yourself.	Wenza wena.
Again the story is a thing.	Kwakhona ibali yinto.
I just want to play music.	Ndifuna nje ukudlala umculo.
It is difficult to do so.	Kuba nzima ukwenjenjalo.
We will be back !.	Siza kubuya!.
This, however, is not possible.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka.
He told her to be there.	Wamxelela ukuba abe khona.
It would be very difficult.	Bekuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
You really do this.	Ngokwenene uyenza le nto.
I thought everyone knew this.	Bendicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
I'm not sure what the question is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni umbuzo.
There are things out there.	Kukho izinto apho.
But you know everything about it.	Kodwa uyazi konke ngayo.
But not for years.	Kodwa hayi iminyaka.
He came, or he was already here.	Weza, okanye wayesele elapha.
Someone handed me a gun.	Umntu wandinika umpu.
Working with lunch.	Ukusebenza ngesidlo sasemini.
I am local.	Ndingumntu wasekhaya.
There, it's much better now.	Apho, kungcono kakhulu ngoku.
Obviously, you can't.	Ngokucacileyo, awukwazi.
Or eating people.	Okanye ukutya abantu.
Just give me a few days.	Ndinike nje iintsuku ezimbalwa.
But so will you.	Kodwa nawe uya kuba njalo.
The answer is, you can't.	Impendulo kukuba, awukwazi.
It would be great for sure.	Kuya kuba kuhle ngokuqinisekileyo.
He wanted more.	Wayefuna ezinye izinto ezininzi.
He immediately agreed.	Wavuma nam ngoko nangoko.
This is not the place for me.	Ayisiyiyo le ndawo kum.
I don't want you talking now.	Andifuni uthetha ngoku.
But the big problem.	Kodwa ingxaki enkulu.
I don't care why.	Andikhathali ukuba kutheni.
Your work here is done.	Umsebenzi wakho apha uyenzile.
He saw that it was really him.	Wabona ukuba nguye ngokwenene.
Or hours.	Okanye iiyure.
He had done that before.	Wenze njalo ngaphambili.
No, you are not.	Awuyi, awuyi.
You come here because you want to take our money.	Uza apha kuba ufuna ukuthatha imali yethu.
He knew he could do better.	Wayesazi ukuba angayenza ngcono.
And if so.	Kwaye ukuba kunjalo.
Well, you did well.	Ke, wenze kakuhle.
Sorry, you did not.	Uxolo lwam, ukuba awuzange.
You do not have to say the same thing.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe into enye.
I want to get out on the floor.	Ndifuna ukuphuma phantsi.
This time, he was wearing his shirt.	Ngeli xesha, wayenxibe ihempe yakhe.
You have even more than you think.	Uye nangona kakhulu kunokuba ucinga.
How it goes.	Ukuba kuqhubeka njani.
He had to go slowly.	Kwafuneka ahambe kancinci.
I'm really tired.	Ndidiniwe nyani.
But not long after that.	Kodwa kungekudala emva koko.
No more than anyone else, though.	Akukho ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na, nangona kunjalo.
He should have done so.	Bekufanele enze njalo.
But he talked to me.	Kodwa wathetha nam.
Her father came out.	Utata wakhe waphuma phandle.
Something happened to it.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuyo.
You play with him clearly.	Udlala naye ngokucacileyo.
The problem really is time.	Ingxaki ngokwenene lixesha.
It should, really.	Kufuneka, ngenene.
I live alone.	Ndihlala ndedwa .
Or not, really.	Okanye akunjalo, ngokwenene.
Not so far away.	Hayi kude kangako.
I can’t imagine how you feel or how you feel.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba uziva njani okanye uziva njani.
It's not me here.	Ayindim apha.
Stop holding back.	Yeka ukuzibamba.
As you are now.	Njengoko unjalo ngoku.
Good on that.	Kuhle kuloo nto.
None of my person.	Akukho mntu wam.
He wanted something else from her.	Wayefuna enye into kuye.
Clearly it is very good.	Kucacile ukuba kuhle kakhulu.
There is always something going on in this place.	Kuhlala kukho into eyenzekayo kule ndawo.
And now you want to learn more.	Ke ngoku ufuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
They will be very successful.	Baza kuphumelela kakhulu.
I mean to meet you.	Ndithetha ukudibana nawe.
It is even more possible that.	Kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ukuba .
Also swimming.	Kwakhona ukuqubha.
I hope all goes well with you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle nawe.
If you did, you should tell me.	Ukuba uyenzile, kufuneka undixelele.
You learn to do this.	Ufunda ukwenza oku.
Now fast to go today.	Ngoku ngokukhawuleza ukuya namhlanje.
At the time he knew.	Ngelo xesha wayesazi.
Maybe we will be much better than you expect.	Mhlawumbi siya kuba ngcono kakhulu kunokuba ulindele.
Just a tip here.	Icebiso nje apha.
But no one is talking to me.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha nam.
He came in great numbers.	Weza ezininzi kakhulu.
I'll take it easy.	Ndiza kuthatha lula.
The doctor looked at everyone.	Ugqirha wajonga wonke umntu.
Well, not exactly.	Ewe, hayi kanye kanye.
He asked for time.	Wacela ixesha.
However, it is very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, kunzima kakhulu.
Other than that, you know what it is.	Ngaphandle koko, uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Just a mistake.	Impazamo nje.
That's all you need to know about me.	Yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyazi ngam.
I wish to die my way.	Ndinqwenela ukufa ngendlela yam.
But it will probably be so.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
Tell me why you want to go.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni ufuna ukuhamba.
Do not try to leave the hospital.	Musa ukuzama ukuphuma esibhedlele.
And so it will be.	Kwaye ke kuya kuba njalo.
But you have a problem.	Kodwa unayo ingxaki.
I will do all that.	Ndiya kuyenza yonke loo nto.
Well, you already know that.	Ewe, sele uyayazi loo nto.
But you know that it is impossible.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka oko.
Almost everyone loves it.	Phantse wonke umntu uyayithanda.
But something seemed to be happening.	Kodwa kwakubonakala ngathi kukho into eyenzekayo.
But for now, not always.	Kodwa oko okwangoku, hayi rhoqo.
In spite of .	Ngaphandle kokuba .
Being angry.	Ukuba nomsindo.
We have made a decision.	Senze isigqibo.
I've been this way.	Ndibe kule ndlela.
He ran to the car and left.	Wabaleka ukuya emotweni wemka.
You know that.	Uyayazi lonto.
Not people, but other things.	Hayi abantu, kodwa ezinye izinto.
There is a slight problem with this method, however.	Kukho ingxaki encinci ngale ndlela, nangona kunjalo.
And you know exactly when.	Kwaye uyazi kakuhle ukuba nini.
Just before he did that.	Ngaphambi nje kokuba enze oko.
This will only be one thing.	Oku kuya kuba yinto enye kuphela.
I'll talk about how to do that later.	Ndiza kuthetha ngendlela yokwenza oko kamva.
And he certainly did this.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo wenze oku.
Then, maybe it should be.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi kufuneka kube njalo.
He did this and nothing else.	Uyenzile le nto kwaye akukho nto.
But then he returned.	Kodwa emva koko, wabuyela kuyo.
However, you have done a great job.	Nangona kunjalo, wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
There is always a way.	Kuhlala kukho indlela.
I didn't even want to be here.	Bendingafuni nokuba lapha.
Dad is doing well right now.	Utata uqhuba kakuhle okwangoku.
I made a call.	Ndenze umnxeba.
We will have to go home.	Kuza kufuneka siye kwam.
There is a marriage though.	Ukhona umtshato kodwa.
I have to do the same.	Nam kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto.
No friends, for now.	Hayi abahlobo, okwangoku.
He did, too.	Wenza njalo, naye.
This will happen once and for all.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kanye.
Good to have you today.	Kuhle ukuba nawe namhlanje.
And you did wrong all the time.	Kwaye wenze engalunganga ngalo lonke ixesha.
You never talked to me.	Khange uthethe nam.
Nothing, too.	Akukho nto, kakhulu.
Of course not.	Hayi ke kodwa.
He knew he had not done so.	Wayesazi ukuba akenzanga njalo.
Yes, there are a few things.	Ewe, kukho izinto ezimbalwa.
You will find out what all this is going to be like.	Uya kufumana ukuba yonke le nto iza kuba yintoni.
It looked like a human being.	Kwakubonakala ngathi ngumntu.
You play with it every night.	Udlala ngayo rhoqo ebusuku.
I couldn't speak much.	Andikwazanga ukuthetha kakhulu.
But he soon felt bad about it.	Kodwa kungekudala waziva kakubi ngayo.
Then great.	Emva koko enkulu.
So look at this.	Ngoko jonga oku.
But he told her no.	Kodwa wamxelela ukuba hayi.
He never sat down.	Zange ahlale phantsi.
You know what you need to know.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyazi.
Moreover, he had to leave immediately.	Ngaphezu koko, kwafuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
And there are many, many more.	Kwaye kukho ezininzi, ezininzi ngakumbi.
He will come when he is better.	Uza kuza xa engcono.
But more and more.	Kodwa ngakumbi ngakumbi.
Only the mind, really.	Ingqondo kuphela, ngokwenene.
We will have to go far.	Kuza kufuneka siye kude.
Letters that are right.	Ileta ukuba kulungile.
So it must have been that way.	Ngoko kumele ukuba kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
But it is not and you know it.	Kodwa akunjalo kwaye uyazi.
He knows everything.	Uyazi konke.
I know how.	Ndiyazi ukuba njani.
So maybe every other day.	Ngoko mhlawumbi yonke enye imini.
It is our first job.	Ngumsebenzi wethu wokuqala.
He was later.	Waba kamva.
There was no accident.	Kwakungekho ngozi.
Well, not so with us.	Ewe, akunjalo ngathi .
He does not know when or who he is.	Akazi ukuba nini okanye ngubani.
I do things.	Ndenza izinto.
And it is very difficult to work with it.	Kwaye kunzima kakhulu ukusebenza nayo.
He wants to eat with friends.	Ufuna ukutya kunye nabahlobo.
Why, yes, that's right.	Kutheni, ewe, kunjalo.
I never told anyone to do it.	Khange ndixelele mntu ukuba ayenze.
No one is coming after you.	Akukho mntu uza emva kwakho.
No one wants to die for a long time.	Akukho mntu unqwenela ukufa ixesha elide.
Do not do that at night.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto ebusuku.
But he never, not exactly, never again.	Kodwa akazange, hayi ncam, hayi kwakhona.
That should not have happened.	Oko bekungafanelanga ukuba kwenzeke.
And suddenly, again.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza, kwakhona.
Because he tried so hard.	Kuba wazama kakhulu.
Moreover, he concluded.	Ngaphezu koko, wagqiba.
Maybe I did, yes.	Mhlawumbi ndiyenzile, ewe.
Maybe he's better than me.	Mhlawumbi ungcono kunam.
I don't remember his name.	Andikhumbuli igama lakhe.
You will probably be the first one.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba ngowokuqala.
You certainly read a lot.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufunda kakhulu.
And every morning I think, okay.	Kwaye rhoqo kusasa ndicinga, kulungile.
Just look now.	Jonga nje ngoku.
You have to talk regularly, though.	Kufuneka uthethe rhoqo, nangona kunjalo.
His friends did not go to prison.	Abahlobo bakhe abazange baye entolongweni.
You know, that woman.	Uyazi, ukuba umfazi .
And it's okay with us.	Kwaye kulungile ngathi.
I hope they come back.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kubuya.
There is just no other way.	Akukho nje enye indlela.
Just, you know, for you.	Nje, uyazi, ngenxa yakho.
I mean down, down, down.	Ndithetha phantsi, phantsi, phantsi.
But he continued for a long time.	Kodwa waqhubeka ixesha elide.
This is what you are here for.	Le ulapha ngayo.
Not really now.	Hayi nyani ngoku.
I don't think it will happen again.	Andiqondi ukuba iya kwenzeka kwakhona.
I know all of that.	Ndiyayazi yonke loo nto.
I didn't want to talk to her about it.	Bendingafuni ukuthetha naye ngalonto.
I just feel tired.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe nje.
I just want time.	Ndifuna nje ixesha.
I saw breakfast.	Ndabona isidlo sakusasa.
She looked back at him.	Ujonge ngasemva kuye.
No one else.	Akukho namnye umntu.
I just want to work.	Ndifuna nje ukusebenza.
I do not understand more than you.	Andiqondi ngaphezu kwakho.
That is my plan.	Licebo lam ke elo .
That's how he makes his money.	Uyenza ngaloo ndlela imali yakhe.
Tom sat down.	UTom wahlala phantsi.
Everyone says.	Wonke umntu uthi.
They drown.	Wazama wazama.
That would be really nice.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle ngenene.
My mother just wanted a girl.	Umama wayefuna nje intombi.
The image works the same way.	Umfanekiso usebenza ngendlela efanayo.
And yet your mother doesn't like you.	Kwaye kunjalo umama wakho akakuthandi.
And he is your person.	Kwaye ungumntu wakho.
It happens very often.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
Either you already have it or you will do it.	Okanye sele unayo okanye uya kwenza.
He is, however.	Unjalo kodwa.
Then go ahead in time.	Emva koko uya phambili ngexesha.
We will definitely do it now.	Ngokwenene siza kuyenza ngoku.
Maybe even now.	Mhlawumbi nangoku.
Or whatever, about that.	Okanye nantoni na, ngaloo nto.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukwenza le nto.
You learn to drive.	Ufunda ukuqhuba.
And now he wants you.	Kwaye ngoku ufuna wena.
And you will not be alone there.	Kwaye awuyi kuba wedwa apho.
No, not really friends.	Hayi, hayi abahlobo ncam.
I don't know how you do it.	Andazi ukuba uyenza njani.
I think you would like to know.	Ndicinga ukuba ungathanda ukwazi.
I'm just a person who wants peace.	Ndingumntu ofuna nje uxolo.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka .
No, look.	Hayi, ujonge.
I couldn't say why.	Andikwazanga ukuthetha ukuba kutheni.
Let me tell you more about myself.	Makhe ndikuxelele ngakumbi malunga nam.
Not at night.	Hayi ebusuku.
I'm not entirely sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngale nto.
You want too many things.	Ufuna izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
There’s a reason everyone seems to be here, though.	Kukho isizathu sokuba wonke umntu abonakale elapha, nangona kunjalo.
And no less.	Kwaye hayi encinci.
He thought he had told me too much.	Wayecinga ukuba undixelele kakhulu.
Everyone has a problem.	Wonke umntu unengxaki.
Not so, now.	Akunjalo, ngoku.
I have to go everywhere.	Ndifanele ndihambe yonke indawo.
What could it be.	Ingaba yintoni na.
Books, but not books.	Iincwadi, kodwa hayi iincwadi.
However, that is not necessary in this case.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akuyomfuneko kule meko.
You know what this is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na le.
He would love to talk to you.	Angathanda ukuthetha nawe.
But you may be alone.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba ulapha wedwa.
And not just a little bit of it.	Kwaye hayi nje kancinci kuyo.
It must be done immediately.	Kufuneka yenziwe kwangoko.
I think about it all the time.	Ndicinga ngayo yonke loo nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
I tried to get out of our bedroom.	Ndazama ukuphuma egumbini lethu lokulala.
Just tell me where it is.	Ndixelele nje ukuba iphi.
A little earlier than he wanted.	Kancinci ngaphambili kunokuba wayefuna.
Don't think too much of it.	Musa ukucinga ngayo kakhulu.
Better yet.	Kungcono ukuba kunjalo.
Now they will.	Ngoku baza kwenza njalo.
While it is possible, that is not possible.	Nangona kunokwenzeka, oko akunakwenzeka.
You learn a lot as you go.	Ufunda okuninzi njengoko uhamba.
He never told me about you, though.	Akazange andixelele ngawe, nangona kunjalo.
In front of him he saw a picture.	Phambi kwakhe wabona umfanekiso.
This will take something else.	Oku kuya kuthatha enye into.
And in this place, he finally told the truth.	Kwaye kule ndawo, ekugqibeleni wathetha inyaniso.
He knew one or two things.	Wayesazi into enye okanye ezimbini.
No one does that.	Akukho namnye owenza oko.
I came here with you.	Ndize apha nawe.
It really could be better.	Ngokwenene kunokuba ngcono.
You will need to look at your time now.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge ixesha lakho ngoku.
But it may not have happened at all.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akuzange kwenzeke.
Yes it would be difficult.	Ewe bekuya kuba nzima.
They will eat sooner or later.	Baza kutya kungekudala okanye kamva.
We should be sad.	Sifanele sibe buhlungu.
And very unusual.	Kwaye engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Akukho xesha lokwenza nantoni na ngayo.
The problem is that everyone wants to be here.	Ingxaki kukuba wonke umntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
All of that is the first person.	Konke oko ngumntu wokuqala.
I'll have to wait.	Kuza kufuneka ndilinde.
Dog, too.	Inja, nayo.
Thank you for being a good friend.	Enkosi ngokuba ngumhlobo olungileyo.
But he should not have done that, not today.	Kodwa bekungafanelanga ukuba enze njalo, hayi namhlanje.
However, some hours, some days.	Nangona kunjalo, ezinye iiyure, ezinye iintsuku.
He is not very frequent.	Akakho rhoqo kakhulu.
It's all a man.	Konke yindoda.
But he knew he needed to know.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka azi.
I want to know if you are.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba unjalo.
It will take a long time for us.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kuthi.
I don't know why anyone.	Andazi ukuba kutheni nabani na.
Yes, you, too.	Ewe, nawe, nawe.
I'm trying something else.	Ndizama enye into.
And you, of course.	Kwaye wena, kunjalo.
So we did not.	Ngoko asizange senze.
Not much of mine has ever ended.	Akukho nto ingako yam kuye kwaphela.
It wasn’t hard, really.	Kwakungekho nzima, ngokwenene.
You read well.	Ufunda kakuhle.
You know what your truth is.	Uyayazi ukuba yintoni na inyaniso yakho.
This time, you know.	Ngeli xesha, uyazi.
I doubt you know.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uyazi.
And he knew a lot.	Kwaye wayesazi kakhulu.
In all old things do not do wrong.	Kuyo yonke into endala musa ukwenza kakubi.
He hurt and he hurt.	Wenza buhlungu kwaye wenza buhlungu.
So all is well, by the way.	Ngoko konke kulungile, ngendlela.
I'm trying to do something right here.	Ndizama ukwenza into elungileyo apha.
He tried to speak hard.	Wazama ukuthetha nzima.
I think there is a marriage now.	Ndicinga kukho umtshato ngoku.
Nobody likes the police.	Akukho mntu uthanda amapolisa.
And this is not about me.	Kwaye oku akukho malunga nam.
But really, there is more.	Kodwa ngokwenene, kukho okuninzi.
I have no money.	Andinayo imali.
It just might be easier to get better.	Kuphela nje kunokuba lula ukuba ngcono.
If you plan to stay in your room do not.	Ukuba uceba ukuhlala kwigumbi lakho musa.
I will take everything as soon as possible.	Ndiza kuthatha yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
And it's good to have you at home too.	Kwaye kuhle ukuba nawe ekhaya.
You better do something like this.	Kungcono wenze into enje.
Don’t wait so long to do it.	Musa ukulinda ixesha elide kangaka ukuyenza.
So help me out with this.	Ngoko ke ndincede kule nto.
I wanted my gun.	Ndandifuna umpu wam.
It will be soon, though.	Uya kuba kungekudala, nangona kunjalo.
I was just thinking about everything.	Bendicinga nje ngayo yonke into.
And you will be with me.	Kwaye uza kuba kunye nam.
We need your help as soon as possible.	Sifuna uncedo lwakho ngokukhawuleza.
And everyone said they would do it again.	Kwaye wonke umntu wathi baya kuyenza kwakhona.
He lived with us.	Wayehlala nathi.
I will do it.	Ndiya kuyenza.
Or really.	Okanye ngenene.
One does not know.	Umntu akazi.
I came completely.	Ndize ngokupheleleyo.
He did a good job with her.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle kunye naye.
Not just for us.	Hayi nje ngathi.
Or not always.	Okanye hayi rhoqo.
Finally, her son.	Ekugqibeleni, unyana wakhe.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Kuya kuba yinto embi ukuyenza.
In my house.	Endlwini yam.
He had to enter the house and sit down.	Kwafuneka angene endlini ahlale phantsi.
One lives in a large area.	Umntu uhlala kwindawo enkulu.
He does not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba enze njalo.
I saw a lot of people.	Ndabona abantu abaninzi.
No one was going to stay there.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuhlala apho.
I knew it would be fine, but not that way.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba kuhle, kodwa hayi ngolo hlobo.
It will be with you when there is a problem.	Kuya kuba nawe xa kukho ingxaki.
He did not want to go.	Wayengafuni ukuya.
He would start immediately.	Wayeza kuqala kwangoko.
Whatever it is, you know.	Nokuba yintoni na, uyazi.
Now he does.	Ngoku uyayenza.
And one.	Kwaye enye .
I'm trying to make you think.	Ndizama ukwenza ukuba ucinge.
I wish to come here.	Ndinqwenela ukuza apha.
So we'll see how it happens.	Ngoko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka njani.
One woman retired.	Omnye umfazi wathatha umhlala-phantsi.
Everyone is acting strangely.	Wonke umntu wenza ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
There are your friends.	Kukho abahlobo bakho.
So we had to do.	Ngoko kwafuneka senze.
I just wanted to be old myself.	Bendifuna nje ukuba mdala mna.
Something happened before.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo ngaphambili.
Then, she saw a beautiful picture right next to her.	Emva koko, wabona umfanekiso omhle kanye ecaleni kwakhe.
But in the end he did not do this.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni akazange akwenze oku.
There was no money in it.	Kwakungekho mali kuyo.
But this is not the case at all.	Kodwa oku akunjalo kwaphela.
We want you here.	Sifuna nawe apha.
And then we had to go.	Kwaye ke kwafuneka sihambe.
But, of course, you know that.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
This question has been sitting around for a while.	Lo mbuzo uye wahlala kancinci kum.
Okay, though.	Ilungile, nangona kunjalo.
Maybe you have it in your work.	Mhlawumbi unayo emsebenzini wakho.
I know, my bad.	Ndiyazi, embi yam.
But he decided to find out.	Kodwa wagqiba ekubeni azi.
You cannot drive.	Awukwazi ukuqhuba.
Just in time now.	Kanye ngexesha ngoku.
But he didn't think of anything.	Kodwa akazange acinge nantoni na.
Not three years.	Hayi iminyaka emithathu.
I have no more than that.	Andinayo ngaphezu koko.
Or look at me.	Okanye ujonge kum.
A good marriage.	Umtshato olungileyo.
Yes, it can be quite strange.	Ewe, kunokuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
He looked down the other way.	Wajonga phantsi ngenye indlela.
He just wanted to know.	Wayefuna nje ukwazi.
I didn't want to tell you that.	Bendingafuni ukukuxelela lonto.
I don't want that to happen.	Andifuni ukuba oko kwenzeke.
He was very late, of course.	Wayesele kakhulu emva kwexesha, kunjalo.
But he will do this.	Kodwa uza kuyenza le nto.
If possible you will not be able to get a house.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka awukwazi ukufumana indlu.
Now no one is playing with it.	Ngoku akukho mntu udlala ngayo.
That could be all of that.	Inokuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
Everyone did that.	Wonke umntu wayenza loo nto.
He told me about his work.	Wandixelela ngomsebenzi wakhe.
Or if you want me too.	Okanye ukuba ufuna nam.
Although that would be nice to do.	Nangona oko kuya kuba kuhle ukuba wenze.
Nobody wants you to do that.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba wenze njalo.
It's all done.	Yonke loo nto yenziwe.
All, really.	Yonke, ngokwenene.
He knew that nothing like that would happen.	Wayesazi ukuba akukho nto iza kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
You can be there now.	Unokuba khona ngoku.
This should be very fun.	Oku kufuneka kube mnandi kakhulu.
All right, then.	Konke kulungile, ngoko.
He drives very fast.	Uqhuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Some would say yes.	Abanye baya kuthi ewe.
And he is good to me.	Kwaye ulungile kum.
I have to look bad.	Kufuneka ndijonge kakubi.
But this will happen again, someday.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona, ngenye imini.
He did not want her to leave without him.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe ngaphandle kwakhe.
You will start first.	Uza kuqala.
I have never read anything like it.	Andizange ndifunde into enje.
Maybe someone is coming forward.	Mhlawumbi umntu uza ngaphambili.
But it did not have to be this way.	Kodwa bekungafanelanga ukuba kube njalo.
He looked around the bedroom.	Wajonga egumbini lokulala.
Probably not always.	Mhlawumbi hayi rhoqo.
Would you like that.	Ngaba ungathanda ukuba .
But he could not speak for sure.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
What you ate.	Oko watya.
Nothing else yet.	Akukho enye into okwangoku.
It's too far up.	Kude kakhulu phezulu.
A brisk walk in the afternoon is best.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza emva kwemini kungcono.
Or do you think you did.	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenza.
He knew it was coming soon.	Wayesazi ukuba iza kufika kungekudala.
No, no.	Akunjalo, hayi.
I wanted him to do that.	Bendifuna enze njalo.
Not that, when.	Hayi ukuba, nini.
And it was no more than that.	Kwaye kwakungekho ngaphezu koko.
In her bedroom.	Egumbini lakhe lokulala.
My day is made.	Yenziwe imini yam.
Don’t forget the coffee, though.	Ungalibali ikofu, nangona kunjalo.
But he got out of it.	Kodwa waphuma kuyo.
He never read it to anyone.	Akazange afunde nabani na.
And before he could say anything he went on.	Kwaye phambi kokuba athethe nantoni na waqhubeka.
And you know what, we have to do.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yintoni na, kufuneka senze.
But he soon became angry.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza waba nomsindo.
He was fully clothed.	Wayenxibe ngokupheleleyo.
I did not have any money.	Khange ndibe mali.
Check out my story here.	Jonga ibali lam apha.
He was not as painful as you.	Akazange abe buhlungu njengawe.
But no, he has to learn.	Kodwa hayi, kufuneka afunde.
That was fun.	Oko kube mnandi.
She ran to the house.	Wabaleka waya endlini.
I think you did a great job.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
I hope it succeeds, really.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kuphumelela, ngenene.
I look up to you.	Ndijonge phezulu kuwe.
Going through this now.	Ukuhamba ngale nto ngoku.
It will have to be redone.	Kuya kufuneka yenziwe kwakhona.
I really want to.	Ndifuna ngokwenene.
I do not have to wait long.	Akufuneki ndilinde ixesha elide.
And you can't get out !!!.	Kwaye awukwazi ukuphuma !!!.
I just want to get better.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ngcono.
Well, it will always happen.	Kulungile, kuya kwenzeka njalo.
I tried to get her attention.	Ndazama ukufumana ingqalelo yakhe.
And there is no question as to why.	Kwaye akukho mbuzo malunga nokuba kutheni.
She is afraid to be alone.	Woyika ukuba yedwa.
But he certainly knew why.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
That way, he won't leave.	Ngaloo ndlela, akayi kuhamba.
No, nothing much.	Hayi, akukho nto ingako.
He has to stay here.	Kufuneka ahlale apha.
He did not want much.	Akazange afune nto ingako.
I couldn't wait to see what he would become.	Andizange ndikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuba uza kuba yintoni.
He didn’t appear in it, though.	Akazange abonakale kuyo, nangona kunjalo.
Only this once.	Kuphela oku kube kanye.
Eventually, he would arrive too late for lunch.	Ekugqibeleni, wayeza kufika emva kwexesha kakhulu kwisidlo sasemini.
I just want a window.	Ndifuna nje ifestile.
I told her not to do it.	Ndimxelele ukuba angayenzi.
But if you are scared.	Kodwa ukuba uyoyika .
No one needs to learn anything.	Akukho mntu kufuneka afunde nto.
So you will always have it.	Ngoko uya kuhlala unayo.
This is very difficult and time consuming.	Oku kunzima kakhulu kwaye kuthatha ixesha.
It will take three.	Kuya kuthatha ezintathu.
I think it would be nice this way, though.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle ngale ndlela, nangona kunjalo.
Nobody lives like that anymore.	Akukho mntu uhlala ngolo hlobo kwakhona.
My father told me this.	Utata undixelele lento.
I can't take anything lightly.	Andikwazi ukuthatha nantoni na kancinci.
Coffee is good too.	Ikofu ilungile nayo.
And everything will happen.	Kwaye yonke into iya kwenzeka.
We have done a lot.	Senze okuninzi.
She told me Mom.	Undixelele uMama.
Now she knows what she wants.	Ngoku uyayazi into ayifunayo.
One day it will happen.	Ngenye imini kuya kwenzeka.
And clearly that’s for him.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo oko kuye.
No better no.	Hayi ngcono hayi.
As here.	Njengokuba lapha.
Where would you like to go?	Ungathanda ukuya phi.
She looks down slightly.	Ujonge phantsi kancinci.
And it still seems very difficult.	Kwaye nangoku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
Until it is fun.	Kude kube mnandi.
This time he sat down.	Ngeli xesha wahlala phantsi.
I couldn't do that, either.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza loo nto, nam.
It's all very real.	Yonke yinyani kakhulu.
He spent time alone.	Wachitha ixesha eyedwa.
Do something else.	Ngaba enye into.
So, he realized it was him.	Ngoko, waqonda ukuba nguye.
Well done though.	Wenze kakuhle kodwa.
He must come immediately.	Kufuneka eze kwangoko.
And, his age.	Kwaye, iminyaka yakhe.
There is no danger in it.	Akukho ngozi kuyo.
You know, something like that.	Uyazi, into enjalo.
I'm scared again.	Ndiyoyika kwakhona.
No one talked too much about breakfast.	Akukho mntu wathetha kakhulu ngesidlo sakusasa.
Maybe he didn't go.	Mhlawumbi akazange ahambe.
Maybe all of us now.	Mhlawumbi sonke ngoku.
That will go away soon.	Oko kuya kuhamba kungekudala.
We don't have to have it.	Akufunekanga sibe nayo.
So yes it is.	Ngoko ewe kunjalo.
He spoke clearly and clearly.	Wathetha ngokucacileyo kwaye kakuhle.
You will never be me.	Soze ube ndim.
Everyone has hurt everyone.	Wonke umntu wenze buhlungu wonke umntu.
But soon they will see what it is.	Kodwa kungekudala baya kubona ukuba yintoni na.
But not entirely bad.	Kodwa hayi kakubi ngokupheleleyo.
It has to be something else.	Kumele kube enye into.
So maybe you should tell me what happened.	Ngoko mhlawumbi ufanele undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But you never said that.	Kodwa awuzange uthethe oko.
Every day, he returned to her.	Yonke imihla, wabuyela kuye.
He wanted something else, so he left.	Wayefuna enye into, ngoko wemka.
He is determined to go.	Uzimisele ukuhamba.
It comes to you on the side.	Iza kuwe ecaleni.
Old place, too.	Indawo endala, nayo.
Come.	Uza .
No one deserves this.	Akukho mntu ufanele oku.
I saw one here.	Ndibone enye apha.
He lived with her.	Wayehlala nayo.
It would only speak to him.	Bekuya kuthetha naye kuphela.
That's him now.	Nguye lowo ngoku.
I don't have to go here.	Akufunekanga ndihambe apha.
He had to learn everything.	Kwafuneka afunde yonke into.
And then you have to wait for the trial.	Kwaye ke kufuneka ulinde ityala.
Just playing is like that.	Ukudlala nje kunjalo.
And the food is really good.	Kwaye ukutya kuhle ngokwenene.
And it's hard to do that.	Kwaye kunzima ukwenza oko.
I wanted to make money.	Ndandifuna ukwenza imali.
It wasn’t hard or difficult.	Kwakungekho nzima okanye kunzima.
You better succeed.	Kungcono uphumelele.
So they say it's okay.	Ngoko bathi kulungile.
I'm not even sure if it's right.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba ilungile na.
This, he said, would be even more difficult.	Oku, uthe, kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
She sits in the back of the classroom.	Uhlala ngasemva eklasini.
It can be really beautiful.	Inokuba mhle ngokwenene.
Doing is doing.	Ukwenza kukwenza.
Maybe he is.	Mhlawumbi nguye .
I knew it wouldn't happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
I never did it then.	Andizange ndiyenze ngoko.
He was very scared then.	Wayesoyika kakhulu ngoko.
Not too old for me now.	Akukho mdala kakhulu kum ngoku.
He started saying something else.	Waqalisa ukuthetha enye into.
What else .	Yintoni enye .
This time he fully entered.	Ngeli xesha wangena ngokupheleleyo.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma ke.
That's probably it.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi.
But it will appear again.	Kodwa iya kubonakala kwakhona.
Just think of it.	Ucinge nje ngayo.
It must be very painful.	Kumele ukuba buhlungu kakhulu.
I hesitate in my place.	Ndiyathandabuza kwindawo yam.
And home again.	Kwaye ekhaya kwakhona.
There is no food outside.	Akukho kutya ngaphandle.
I know there is.	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho.
In the end, he made a decision.	Ekugqibeleni, wenza isigqibo.
You have to tell him.	Kufuneka umxelele.
You.	Wena .
I thought he loved her too.	Ndandicinga ukuba naye uyamthanda.
You do not want that to happen.	Awufuni ukuba oko kwenzeke.
Nice too meet you!.	Ndiyavuya ukudibana nawe!.
They will all do it.	Bonke baya kuyenza.
He began to think.	Waqalisa ukucinga.
But he did, very well.	Kodwa wenza, kakuhle kakhulu.
I apologize for everything.	Ndithetha uxolo ngayo yonke into.
But he is smart.	Kodwa ukrelekrele.
I feel a little tired.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe kancinci.
Not in the same way.	Akunjalo ngendlela efanayo.
You must have made a mistake.	Umele ukuba wenze impazamo.
Anything but, they say.	Nantoni na kodwa, bathi.
However, there is a big problem here.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki enkulu apha.
So, we want to.	Ngoko ke, sifuna.
He should come with you.	Ufanele ukuba uze nawe.
We will continue with it.	Siza kuqhubeka nayo.
I thought he was a man.	Ndandicinga ukuba yindoda.
He had done it before.	Wayenza ngaphambili.
I don't have to go to the office every day.	Andiyi kufuneka ndiye eofisini yonke imihla.
I'm not going there.	Andiyi apho.
Well, to me, no.	Ewe, kum, hayi.
He would go there himself soon.	Wayeza kuya apho ngokwakhe kungekudala.
He walked for two hours.	Wahamba iiyure ezimbini.
Not that money.	Hayi loo mali.
He did it his way.	Wenza ngendlela yakhe.
One, one after another.	Omnye, emva komnye.
Seeing my friends.	Ukubona abahlobo bam.
We will not do any exceptions.	Asiyi kwenza nayiphi na ngaphandle.
It happens anytime.	Kwenzeka nanini na.
He told her he was coming.	Wamxelela ukuba uza kuza.
I know how hard this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani oku.
Or performance.	Okanye ukusebenza.
Nothing happened after that.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo emva koko.
He can't do it, not now.	Akanakuyenza loo nto, hayi ngoku.
Good to try, though.	Kuhle ukuzama, nangona kunjalo.
Give me a few days, though, and he'll be back.	Ndinike iintsuku ezimbalwa, nangona kunjalo, kwaye uya kubuya.
I just want to say it.	Ndifuna nje ukuyithetha.
Not far away.	Akukho kude kwaphela.
Every day! 	Yonke imihla!
I think we will see !.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kubona!.
I can’t imagine why, but there is.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba kutheni, kodwa kukho.
You mean work.	Uthetha umsebenzi.
He did not know what would happen.	Wayengazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
That's a small thing.	Nantso ke into encinci.
And then you will walk inside me.	Kwaye ke uya kuhamba ngaphakathi kum.
You know this is not about us.	Uyazi ukuba oku akukho ngathi.
I thought of something.	Ndiye ndacinga into.
No, nothing.	Hayi, akukho nto.
Thank you so much everyone !.	Enkosi kakhulu wonke umntu!.
So he wants a job.	Ngoko ufuna umsebenzi.
It will not be late until evening.	Akuyi kuba kudala kude kube ngokuhlwa.
But something is wrong.	Kodwa ke kukho into engalunganga.
He did not want to die, after all.	Wayengafuni ukufa, emva koko.
He never did that again.	Akazange aphinde enze ngolo hlobo.
Please stay here.	Ndicela uhlale apha.
who is coming here.	ngubani oza apha.
It seems that this could be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi oku kunokuba njalo.
He gave me alcohol.	Wandinika utywala.
He also lives.	Naye uhlala.
I don't know, it hurts.	Andazi, buhlungu.
I think yes and no.	Ndicinga ewe kwaye hayi.
Tell anyone you want.	Xelela nabani na ofuna.
But he soon felt better.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza waziva engcono.
So everyone says.	Ngoko wonke umntu uthi.
He is a much better person than I am.	Ungumntu ongcono kakhulu kunam.
Probably only one.	Mhlawumbi enye kuphela.
And then it happened to you.	Kwaye ke kwenzeka kuwe.
He did not speak to me for a few years.	Akazange athethe nam iminyaka embalwa.
And maybe you can.	Kwaye mhlawumbi unokuba.
We have done that a few times.	Senze loo nto izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
Now please, go your way.	Ngoku nceda, uhambe.
That's one good thing about it.	Yinto enye entle ngayo.
We will stay all day.	Siza kuhlala imini yonke.
Here is not something or anyone.	Apha asiyonto okanye umntu.
Maybe I never heard of him.	Mhlawumbi zange ndeva ngaye.
But it really is very hard to do.	Kodwa ngokwenene kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
There he did something very unusual.	Apho wenza into engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I have never been this far from home.	Andizange ndibe kude ngale ndlela ekhaya.
In fact, .	Inyaniso, .
And yet, he did not know that he was there.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, wayengazi ukuba ukhona.
Our mother was terrified.	Umama wethu wayesoyika.
I thought that too.	Nam ndacinga lonto.
I felt bad.	Ndive kakubi.
I want more peace than anyone else.	Ndifuna uxolo ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
Well, we have to go now.	Ewe, kufuneka sihambe ngoku.
So it is with me.	Kunjalo ngam.
All to you.	Konke kuwe.
Really though.	Ngenene nangona.
But he made the same money.	Kodwa wenza imali efanayo.
Well, you have to stay with you.	Ewe, kufuneka uhlale nawe.
Obviously, it's hard.	Ngokucacileyo, kunzima.
I can't say what will happen now.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
That is definitely coming.	Oko kuza ngokuqinisekileyo.
There is something strange about his way.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga ngendlela yakhe.
You will do almost the same thing every day.	Uya kwenza phantse into enye yonke imihla.
He just didn't.	Akazange nje .
Now he knew everything.	Ngoku wayesazi yonke into.
I mean that way.	Ndithetha ukuba ngendlela.
It’s work, really.	Ngumsebenzi, ngokwenene.
I will not mention his name.	Andiyi kuthetha igama lakhe.
For now, though.	Okwangoku, nangona kunjalo.
You want your place.	Ufuna indawo yakho.
It would be fun to play there.	Bekuya kuba mnandi ukudlala apho.
There is but.	Kukho kodwa.
Trying to stay regular.	Ukuzama ukuhlala rhoqo.
However it looks good and works well.	Nangona kunjalo ukhangeleka kakuhle kwaye usebenza kakuhle.
It happened just before.	Kwenzeka kanye ngaphambili.
And now there is this.	Kwaye ngoku kukho oku.
Because of you, the way you do.	Ngenxa yakho, indlela owenza ngayo.
Here, there is no exception.	Apha, akukho ngaphandle.
Easy, that one.	Lula, lowo.
This time he was.	Ngeli xesha nguye.
He is in prison.	Uhleli entolongweni.
There is not much room there.	Akukho ndawo kakhulu apho.
My mother must have known.	Umama umele ukuba wayesazi.
I really want one.	Ndifuna ngokwenene enye.
Isn't it ?.	Akunjalo ?.
I'm not very much lately.	Andikho kakhulu mva nje.
I feel clear.	Ndiziva ngokucacileyo.
Not you or anyone else.	Hayi wena okanye nabani na omnye.
You know what a window is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni ifestile.
I'll find another place.	Ndiza kufumana enye indawo.
He is talking to us.	Uthetha nathi.
Many, many people.	Abaninzi, abantu abaninzi.
I tried to quit before.	Ndazama ukuyeka ngaphambili.
Now my children will talk to me.	Ngoku abantwana bam baza kuthetha nam.
So he just stayed with it.	Ngoko wahlala nje nayo.
He needed my help.	Wayefuna uncedo lwam.
Maybe you don't need it now.	Mhlawumbi akufuneki ngoku.
Now about you.	Ngoku malunga nawe.
I had to sit down.	Kwafuneka ndihlale phantsi.
You know, you make your money.	Uyazi, uyenza imali yakho.
Only me and him.	Mna naye kuphela.
In this case.	Kule ngxaki.
And no matter how hard I try to be beautiful.	Kwaye nokuba ndizama kangakanani ukuba mhle.
He's trying to say something.	Uzama ukuthetha into.
Others will do it.	Abanye baya kukwenza.
You almost have to.	Phantse kufuneka.
A little before my time.	Kancinci ngaphambi kwexesha lam.
That is for all of us.	Nto leyo kuthi sonke.
But he left.	Kodwa wahamba.
We'll see tomorrow.	Siza kubona ngomso.
We have to do that ourselves.	Kufuneka siyenze ngokwethu loo nto.
No one but me knew.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle kwam wayesazi.
Maybe it's really hard to know.	Mhlawumbi kunzima ngokwenene ukwazi.
I don't know what happened to it.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuyo.
Not all is bad, by the way.	Ayisiyiyo yonke into embi, ngendlela.
You think you are smart.	Ucinga ukuba ukrelekrele.
This makes it a lot easier.	Oku kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
Certainly he is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo nguye.
There is a place to stay.	Kukho indawo yokuhlala.
Help me with it.	Ndincede ngayo.
Everything is new, new.	Yonke into entsha, entsha.
Maybe she would have children.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuba nabantwana.
At last!.	Ekugqibeleni!.
I saw one.	Ndabona enye.
The day will come.	Iza kufika imini.
We will be seen for a very long time.	Siza kubonakala ixesha elide kakhulu.
In our house for sure.	Endlwini yethu ngokuqinisekileyo.
That's right and again.	Kunjalo kwaye kwakhona.
I'm going to need a big answer.	Ndiza kufuna impendulo enkulu.
I had to go, too.	Kwafuneka ndihambe, nam.
This is not a toy.	Asiyonto yokudlala le.
He wishes it had never happened.	Unqwenela ukuba akuzange kwenzeke.
Finally, he went to her.	Ekugqibeleni, waya kuye.
Just being a nightmare.	Ukuba nje ubusuku.
Obviously it has to be.	Ngokucacileyo kumele kube njalo.
Certainly anything but.	Ngokuqinisekileyo nantoni na kodwa.
I know you very well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle kakhulu.
I think this will be good though.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba kuhle nangona kunjalo.
We know you exist.	Siyazi ukuba ukhona.
But my father.	Kodwa utata wam.
He doesn't know what else to do.	Akayazi enye into amakayenze.
It will be difficult for you.	Kuya kuba nzima kuwe.
He did not say much about it.	Akazange athethe kakhulu ngaloo nto.
To me, that says a lot about him.	Kum, oko kuthetha okuninzi ngaye.
It will be difficult, though.	Kuya kuba nzima, nangona kunjalo.
Obviously, not every day.	Ngokucacileyo, hayi yonke imihla.
That must happen now.	Loo nto kufuneka yenzeke ngoku.
I just don’t know if it’s possible.	Andazi nje ukuba kunokwenzeka.
This way you like.	Ngale ndlela uthanda.
That would be tomorrow.	Oko bekuya kuba ngomso.
I really wanted a place.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene indawo.
Finally, he did not get into the car.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange angene emotweni.
I will definitely stay here again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuhlala apha kwakhona.
It will do something.	Iya kwenza into.
I can be very angry.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba nomsindo kakhulu.
I think you should go.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uhambe.
That's all man does.	Yiyo yonke into eyenziwa ngumntu.
I think we all did very well, though.	Ndicinga ukuba sonke senze kakuhle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
How long .	Ixesha elingakanani .
One never knew.	Umntu akazange azi.
He lived alone, at home.	Wahlala yedwa, ekhaya.
You really have it.	Unayo ngokwenene.
Everyone succeeds here.	Wonke umntu uphumelele apha.
He would love to.	Angathanda kakhulu.
The question is.	Lo mbuzo uthi .
I never went home.	Zange agoduke.
I live every day.	Ndihlala yonke imihla.
I try to be away from everyone.	Ndizama ukuba kude kuye wonke umntu.
And don't forget about it ?.	Kwaye ungalibali malunga ?.
And he got angry about it.	Kwaye waba nomsindo ngayo.
That's what comes here.	Yiyo loo nto eza apha.
The mother slept with her son.	Umama walala unyana wakhe.
You're ready to go.	Ulungile ukuhamba.
He left immediately.	Wemka kwangoko.
For now it will.	Kuba ngoku iya kwenza.
He knew he could do this.	Wayesazi ukuba angayenza le nto.
What is happening now ?.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngoku?.
You feel very bad about it.	Uziva kakubi kakhulu ngalo nto.
Work or activity.	Umsebenzi okanye umsebenzi.
He looked away from her.	Wajonga kude kuye.
So you have to do it if everything is fine.	Ngoko ke kufuneka uyenze ukuba yonke into ilungile.
It was not long ago.	Khange kube kudala kwaphela.
The police sat down.	Amapolisa ahlala phantsi.
My son will never.	Unyana wam akanakuze.
My mother has come out strong.	Uye waphuma ngamandla umama.
That's the way it is.	Nantso ke indlela.
He does not need to say anything at this time.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba athethe nto ngeli xesha.
That's all right.	Ilungile yonke loo nto.
But he didn't want me to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba ndenze loo nto.
None of us want that.	Akukho namnye kuthi ofuna oko.
He had to go home.	Kwafuneka aye endlini.
Yeah, and that.	Ewe, naloo nto.
That happened, too.	Oko kwenzeka, kwakhona.
It's just not there.	Akukho nje.
He lives with me now.	Uhlala nam ngoku.
Or, not more.	Okanye, hayi ngakumbi.
He went down the other way.	Wehla ngenye indlela.
But something happened there.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
Only children live there.	Kuphela abantwana bahlala apho.
And just for me, of course.	Kwaye nje kum, kunjalo.
I think the house is good.	Ndicinga ukuba indlu ilungile.
It is not just ours.	Asiyonto nje yethu.
Going to the room.	Ukuya kwigumbi.
He told her he did not want to go.	Wamxelela ukuba akafuni ukuya.
Great house.	Indlu enkulu.
Look now what he wants.	Jonga ngoku ayifunayo.
I thought he would be here.	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba lapha.
If you can do it there, fine.	Ukuba ungayenza apho, kuhle.
I told my daughter.	Ndaxelela intombi yam.
But you will definitely need only one.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo, ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufuna enye kuphela.
But that will take a lot of time.	Kodwa oko kuya kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu.
But there is nothing here.	Kodwa akukho nto apha.
Not a bad bike.	Hayi ibhayisekile embi.
Not because of him.	Hayi ngenxa yakhe.
It's great to work with you.	Kuhle kakhulu ukusebenza nawe.
This is it.	Yile nto .
This job, you know.	Lo msebenzi, uyazi.
But, that requires money.	Kodwa, oko kufuna imali.
I mean no.	Ndithetha akukho.
A gift, indeed.	Isipho, ngokwenene.
It could be too much.	Inokuba kakhulu.
I never told her about it.	Andizange ndimxelele ngayo.
Now and then you do.	Ngoku kwaye emva koko uyenza.
Sorry again.	Uxolo kwakhona.
Then leave.	Emva koko uhambe.
He may have known.	Usenokuba wayesazi .
But there is something strange about this.	Kodwa kukho into engaqhelekanga ngale nto.
I didn’t do it right away.	Andizange ndiyenze kwangethuba.
He would be alone.	Wayeza kuba yedwa.
He would go all day.	Wayeza kuhamba imini yonke.
I don't want that here.	Andifuni lonto apha.
I can't wait to meet you !.	Andikwazi kulinda ukudibana nawe!.
So, no accident happened.	Ngoko, akukho ngozi eyenzekayo.
The questions are correct.	Imibuzo ilungile.
Everyone is interested in you.	Wonke umntu unomdla kuwe.
I am here with him.	Ndilapha kunye naye.
I didn't really know, until now.	Andizange ndiyazi ngokwenene, kude kube ngoku.
My father did not do that.	Utata akazange ayenze loo nto.
I will do this again and again.	Ndiza kwenza oku kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
But he does not like that.	Kodwa akayithandi loo nto.
He did a great job with it.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu ngayo.
He knew this was coming.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kuza.
He died soon afterward.	Wafa kungekudala.
I can't imagine who he is.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba ngubani.
He has been with us all the way.	Ube nathi indlela yonke.
I'm not entirely sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba kutheni.
Just an opportunity.	Ithuba nje.
We'll see soon.	Siza kubona kungekudala.
I can't wait that long.	Andikwazi kulinda ixesha elide kangako.
He said no, not really.	Wathi hayi, hayi ncam.
Finally, he ate.	Ekugqibeleni, watya.
He understood then.	Waqonda ngoko.
I wanted to get out of the car.	Bendifuna ukuphuma emotweni.
He went back to the distance.	Wabuyela ekubeni kude.
So tell me about it.	Ndixelele ke ngayo.
My friends did not.	Abahlobo bam abazange.
Well, this is something for now.	Ewe, le yinto ngoku.
No, tomorrow afternoon.	Hayi, ngomso emva kwemini.
You may be the only one.	Inokuba nguwe kuphela lowo.
I know you can do that.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
Nobody goes.	Akukho mntu uhamba.
He did not know how long it would take.	Wayengazi ukuba inokuba lixesha elingakanani na.
That he can not.	Kukuba akakwazi.
To him, but not so much.	Kuye, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Now he knew he had to do it.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba umele ayenze.
Everything is his first.	Yonke into yakhe kuqala.
You know very well.	Uyazi kakuhle kakhulu.
No no! 	Hayi, hayi!
Only two days.	Iintsuku ezimbini kuphela.
I know many.	Ndiyazi abaninzi.
He just ran to win.	Wabaleka nje ukuphumelela.
But it had to happen this way.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
And one more thing, too.	Kwaye enye into, nayo.
This week you are lucky.	Kule veki unethamsanqa.
There is a question, yes.	Kukho umbuzo, ewe.
You almost knew that.	Uphantse wakwazi oko.
Your letter.	Ileta yakho .
I decided to go again.	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndiphinde ndihambe.
Every time you go.	Ngalo lonke ixesha uhamba.
So, I'm tired.	Ngoko, ndidiniwe.
As really very real.	Njengoko ngokwenene ngokwenene kakhulu.
There is no need at all.	Akukho mfuneko kwaphela.
No one told her what had happened.	Kwakungekho mntu wamxelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
See the story here.	Jonga ibali apha.
I will see my parents.	Ndiza kubona abazali bam.
He did not.	Naye akenzanga.
Not even difficult.	Hayi nokuba nzima.
That is difficult.	Kunzima ke oko.
All the time and everywhere.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kwaye yonke indawo.
He said yes, yes.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo, ewe.
Or someone did.	Okanye umntu wenza.
He didn't want or want another cat.	Wayengafuni okanye afune enye ikati.
He wanted, now.	Wayefuna, ngoku.
One day, one shirt.	Ngenye imini, ihempe enye.
All the time, for sure.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I'm not sure what happened there.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na apho.
You know that in the end, you will succeed.	Uyazi ukuba uya kuphumelela ekugqibeleni.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa ke kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
There is just this place.	Kukho nje le ndawo.
Don't think about that.	Musa ukucinga ngaloo nto.
But that will not be the case.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba njalo.
It can be in two places at the same time.	Into ingaba kwindawo ezimbini ngexesha elinye.
This ended for him.	Kwaphela oku kuye.
I hope to do some things better.	Ndiyathemba ukwenza ezinye izinto ngcono.
He travels for a long time.	Uhamba ixesha elide.
You can do this !.	Ungayenza le nto!.
And, well, I do.	Kwaye, ke, mna.
Getting a job should be your job.	Ukufumana umsebenzi kufuneka kube ngumsebenzi wakho.
It won't go away for long.	Asiyi kuhamba ixesha elide.
He comes in and sits down.	Angene ahlale phantsi.
I know all this.	Ndiyayazi yonke lento.
So off we go.	Ngoko siza kuhamba.
My problem is time.	Ingxaki yam lixesha.
He thought he knew something, but he didn't know who he was.	Wayecinga ukuba uyayazi into, kodwa wayengazi ukuba ngubani.
All but me.	Konke ngaphandle kwam.
Give me another chance.	Ndinike elinye ithuba.
Nobody wants to be angry.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba nomsindo.
This is good, he thought.	Oku kuhle, wacinga.
I did not want a party.	Ndandingafuni itheko.
It's just good once.	Kuhle nje kube kanye.
So he was not.	Ngoko wayengekho.
Just a little bit at the beginning.	Kancinci nje ekuqaleni.
Everyone knew what was going to happen.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
I could do it tonight, though.	Ndingayenza ngokuhlwanje, nangona kunjalo.
Once at work and once at home.	Kanye emsebenzini kwaye kanye ekhaya.
You just have to decide what works best for you.	Kufuneka nje wenze isigqibo sokuba yintoni ethetha ngakumbi kuwe.
I don't think we should go to work tomorrow.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka siye emsebenzini ngomso.
That will mean that you love him.	Oko kuya kuthetha ukuba uyamthanda.
He picked up the phone.	Wathatha umnxeba.
He came after me.	Uye weza emva kwam.
When you think of something, it is real.	Xa ucinga into, yinyani.
He had to go all the way to his start.	Kwafuneka ahambe yonke indlela ukuya ekuqaleni kwakhe.
The truth is, they are not.	Inyaniso kukuba, akunjalo.
Then, he was alone in the room.	Emva koko, waba yedwa kwigumbi elinye.
But we want to talk to you about money.	Kodwa sifuna ukuthetha nawe ngemali.
What is wrong with me.	Yintoni engalunganga ngam.
I know!.	Ndiyazi!.
Well, a bad mistake.	Kulungile, impazamo embi.
One makes it much easier.	Enye kukwenza lula kakhulu.
And my age.	Kwaye iminyaka yam.
Absolutely with you.	Ngokupheleleyo nawe.
My voice.	Ilizwi lam.
And in a big way.	Kwaye ngendlela enkulu.
Look at me.	Jonga kum.
Not much.	Hayi, kakhulu.
Tell me everything yourself.	Ndixelele yonke into wena.
Though somewhere inside of him he wanted it to be so.	Nangona kwindawo ethile ngaphakathi kuye wayefuna ukuba kube njalo.
That is the only answer.	Yiyo kuphela impendulo.
You obviously love it.	Ngokucacileyo uyayithanda.
Because he went away for my sake.	Kuba wemka ngenxa yam.
He left very quickly.	Uhambe ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Really, just a few hours.	Ngokwenene, iiyure nje ezimbalwa.
I will definitely try.	Ndiza kuzama ngokuqinisekileyo.
I hope you will be able to do that one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kukwazi ukwenza oko ngenye imini.
I can't be him.	Andikwazi ukuba nguye.
We will continue, then.	Siza kuqhubeka, ngoko.
We will be back, for sure.	Siza kubuya, ngokuqinisekileyo.
And that means it all.	Kwaye oko kuthetha konke.
He always does that.	Uhlala ekwenza oko.
I wanted to go and live with him.	Ndandifuna ukuya kuhlala naye.
I feel alone.	Ndiziva ndedwa.
He did not want his meal to go away.	Wayengafuni ukuba isidlo sakhe sihambe.
Moreover any car outside.	Ngaphezu koko nayiphi na imoto ngaphandle.
All of this is good as it goes.	Konke oku kulungile njengoko kuhamba.
And now it will be.	Kwaye ngoku kuya kuba.
Or make way.	Okanye wenze indlela.
Probably not always, but it certainly is.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngalo lonke ixesha, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo.
This problem.	Le ngxaki .
There is only one place.	Kukho indawo enye kuphela.
And no one saw it coming.	Kwaye akukho mntu wabona oku kuza.
She was afraid to try again.	Wayesoyika ukuzama kwakhona.
And at that point he was very successful.	Kwaye ngelo xesha uphumelele kakhulu.
I think almost everyone knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba phantse wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
Many though.	Abaninzi nangona kunjalo.
And in doing so.	Kwaye ngokwenza njalo.
He alone will live for the rest of his life.	Nguye kuphela oza kuhlala ubomi bakhe bonke.
In this case, .	Kule meko, .
This means fast.	Oku kuthetha ngokukhawuleza.
Good if you know.	Kuhle ukuba uyazi.
It was completely visible.	Kwakubonakala ngokupheleleyo.
No one is interested.	Akukho mntu unomdla.
All of this takes a lot of time.	Konke oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
He knew everything about us.	Wayesazi yonke into ngathi.
I do think.	Ndenza ukucinga.
I, then.	Ndim, emva koko.
I wanted a father.	Bendifuna utata.
Outside, maybe not.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It will start on it soon.	Iza kuqala kuyo kungekudala.
I think it could be him, though.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba nguye, nangona kunjalo.
Yeah, doing the same thing.	Ewe, ukwenza into enye.
We did a time or two.	Senze ixesha okanye ezimbini.
Just like that.	Kanye njengokuba enjalo.
And then, he'll sit down there.	Kwaye ke, uya kuhlala phantsi apho.
But, you will get another chance.	Kodwa, uya kufumana elinye ithuba.
It's a little difficult.	Kunzima kancinci.
And he won't be there long.	Kwaye akayi kuba apho ixesha elide.
I don't want to be your friend.	Andifuni ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
At dinner, he said.	Ngesidlo sangokuhlwa, wathi.
And if so, that's fine.	Kwaye ukuba kunjalo, kulungile.
Everything wrong will soon end.	Yonke into engalunganga kungekudala iza kuphela.
She's a little scared.	Uyoyika kancinci.
You are good to me too.	Nawe ulungile kum.
Something else is needed.	Kufuneka enye into.
Not anymore.	Akukho kwakhona.
Stop saying that.	Yeka ukuthetha loo nto.
I will not tell him.	Andiyi kumxelela.
Indeed, that is exactly what happened.	Ngokwenene, kwenzeka kanye loo nto kule meko.
I never saw him really.	Khange ndimbone nyani.
Then tell your friends about it.	Emva koko uxelele abahlobo bakho ngayo.
Very woman.	Umfazi kakhulu.
I just think it's good.	Ndicinga nje ukuba kuhle.
This is clearly possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokucacileyo.
I did it for you.	Ndenze kuwe.
You can do all that next week.	Ungayenza yonke loo nto kwiveki ezayo.
He agreed to go.	Wavuma ukuya .
Nothing will happen to us yet.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka kuthi okwangoku.
However, this is hard to do.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kunzima ukwenza.
Here at this place, now.	Apha kule ndawo, ngoku.
He always likes a little.	Ngalo lonke ixesha uthanda kancinci.
It would be strange for me to stay.	Kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga ukuba ndihlale.
Because you think so.	Kuba ucinga ukuba kunjalo.
He is waiting in the car.	Ulinde emotweni.
That will be it.	Iya kuba yiyo loo nto.
Really all day.	Ngokwenene imini yonke.
Something very bad happened.	Kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
He doesn't know it.	Akayazi.
There are a few other things here.	Kukho ezinye izinto ezimbalwa apha.
I'm sorry too.	Ndiyaxolisa nam.
Not going home.	Hayi ukuya ekhaya.
I can do that.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Now that doesn't seem to be the case.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
And you go somewhere.	Kwaye uya kwindawo.
She was dressed the same way but not the same way.	Wayenxibe ngendlela efanayo kodwa hayi ngendlela efanayo.
He may have been scared.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayesoyika.
I can't wait to talk to him.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuthetha naye.
It is not a matter of doing that.	Asiyonto yokwenza oko.
Because you did not.	Ngenxa yokuba awuzange.
My mother told me the other day.	Umama wandixelela ngenye imini.
It's up to him alone.	Kuye yedwa.
Then he said nothing for a long time.	Emva koko akazange athethe nto ixesha elide.
Look at everything.	Jonga konke.
Then we will start.	Emva koko siza kuqala.
He did something great out of nothing.	Wenza into enkulu ngaphandle kwanto.
Certainly, it is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kunjalo.
Maybe that’s a good thing, too.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle, nayo.
They didn't tonight.	Abazange namhlanje ebusuku.
Or how it happened.	Okanye ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Maybe just a big cat or a dog.	Mhlawumbi nje ikati enkulu okanye inja.
He admitted to himself that.	Wavuma ngokwakhe oko.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kuya kufuneka wenze oko kwaye ufike kuyo.
It’s a good time, though.	Lixesha elihle, nangona kunjalo.
They will be with me.	Baza kuba nam.
It is not required.	Akufunekanga.
He wanted to be here.	Wayefuna ukuba lapha.
And other than that, it's okay.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, kulungile.
Not because of you.	Hayi ngenxa yakho.
Not now please.	Hayi ngoku nceda.
I'll have to wait and see.	Kuza kufuneka ndilinde ndibone.
And he heard something else.	Kwaye weva enye into.
He sat next to me.	Uye wahlala ecaleni kwam.
He did an excellent job on his own.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu eyedwa.
We want a better way.	Sifuna indlela engcono.
Maybe someone here.	Mhlawumbi umntu apha.
That should have been easier.	Oko bekufanele ukuba kube lula.
But it also requires something bigger.	Kodwa kwakhona kufuna into enkulu.
They both sit down.	Bahlala phantsi bobabini.
Really, someone did that.	Ngokwenene, kukho umntu owenza loo nto.
I wanted him to tell me the whole story.	Bendifuna andixelele lonke ibali.
Just everyone else.	Bonke abanye nje.
I know something about that.	Ndiyazi into ngaloo nto.
I want to go again.	Ndifuna ukuhamba kwakhona.
I'm tired, a lot of the time.	Ndidiniwe, ixesha elininzi.
Eventually, you will want to know more.	Ekugqibeleni, uya kufuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
Yes I! 	Ewe mna!
Just a few weeks as much.	Iiveki nje ezimbalwa kangangoko.
He said it should be easy.	Wathi kufuneka kube lula.
I will stay only one.	Ndiza kuhlala enye kuphela.
Or you like it very much.	Okanye uyayithanda kakhulu.
He should not go alone obviously.	Akufunekanga ahambe yedwa kucacile.
I never learned much.	Andizange ndifunde nto ingako.
But it happened yesterday.	Kodwa yenzeke izolo.
And that or your life.	Kwaye oko okanye ubomi bakho.
You can do it! 	Ungayenza!
Maybe tomorrow, maybe never.	Mhlawumbi ngomso, mhlawumbi soze.
That's it, he concluded.	Yiloo nto, wagqiba.
And it has to be.	Kwaye kumele kube njalo.
This will become apparent later.	Oku kuya kubonakala ngokucacileyo kamva.
You will have to go through it.	Kuya kufuneka uhambe kuyo.
I do it all the time.	Ndiyenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
And there is, perhaps, something in it.	Kwaye kukho, mhlawumbi, into kuloo nto.
He wants a wife.	Ufuna umfazi.
If you have time, that's fine.	Ukuba unayo ixesha, kuhle.
He just knew he didn't like that.	Wayesazi nje ukuba akayithandi loo nto.
For it will be so.	Kuba kuya kuba njalo.
To make it easier.	Ukwenza kube lula.
That's the thing about it.	Nantso into ngale nto.
I don't remember the name.	Andikhumbuli igama.
No one has ever been able to do that.	Akukho mntu wakha wakwazi ukwenza oko.
You are trying to buy time.	Uzama ukuthenga ixesha.
I learned a lot from him, that's the same thing.	Ndifunde naye kakhulu, yinto enye leyo.
He is leaving soon.	Uza kuhamba kungekudala.
He made her go.	Wenza ukuba ahambe.
Many days now, she works alone.	Iintsuku ezininzi ngoku, usebenza yedwa.
Our work is very, very, very much.	Umsebenzi wethu kakhulu, kakhulu, kakhulu.
He wanted to know all about it.	Wayefuna ukwazi konke ngayo.
I really want him to agree with me.	Ndifuna kakhulu ukuba avume ngam.
There is a party tonight.	Kukho itheko ngokuhlwanje.
He looked away again.	Wajonga ecaleni kwakhona.
I thought for a long time and it is hard to do this.	Ndacinga ixesha elide kwaye kunzima ukwenza oku.
I want to be a good person.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu olungileyo.
But he is retiring.	Kodwa udla umhlala-phantsi.
And nothing could be further from the truth.	Kwaye akukho nto inokuba yinyani ngakumbi.
He decided to stay but.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ahlale kodwa.
He lives in a house.	Uhlala endlini.
It never was you.	Awuzange ube nguwe.
And, yes, he is.	Kwaye, ewe, nguye.
I think you know why.	Ndicinga ukuba uyasazi isizathu sokuba.
He spoke very well.	Uthethe kakuhle kakhulu.
He's just a real man, real good.	Ungumntu nje ngenene, olungileyo ngenene.
I thought for a moment.	Ndacinga kancinci.
Yes you feel bad.	Ewe uziva kakubi.
And again last night.	Kwaye kwakhona phezolo.
There is no peace.	Akukho uxolo.
It will probably be a strange, strange thing.	Mhlawumbi iya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga, into engaqhelekanga.
Don't think of one thing.	Musa ukucinga ngento enye.
But he stayed longer.	Kodwa wahlala de .
You know there are other people here.	Uyazi ukuba kukho abanye abantu apha.
So he agreed.	Ngoko wavuma.
Everyone in the house knew about this.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngale nto endlwini.
You may be that.	Usenokuba yiyo loo nto.
He is here and now.	Ukhona apha kwaye ngoku.
That will be the time.	Oko kuya kuba lixesha.
Yes, it will be easier to get out for dinner.	Ewe, kuya kuba lula ukuphuma kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
I just think of you like you.	Ndicinga nje ngawe njengawe.
That wasn't much better.	Oko kwakungekho ngcono kakhulu.
I felt like my son was going to college.	Ndive ngathi unyana wam uya ekholejini.
Coming together.	Ukuza kunye.
I can control myself now.	Ndiyakwazi ukuzibamba ngoku.
That's not the way things are now.	Akunjalo ngendlela izinto ngoku.
We need help.	Sifanele uncedo.
Or a window.	Okanye ifestile.
He is sitting outside, his gun ready.	Uhleli phandle, umpu wakhe ulungile.
Again, no waiting.	Kwakhona, akukho kulinda.
This is not necessary at all.	Oku akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
He said the same thing.	Wathetha into efanayo.
You are doing much better this week.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu kule veki.
I feel very good.	Ndiziva kakuhle kakhulu.
Looks like he didn't go very far today.	Kubonakala ngathi khange ahambe kakhulu namhlanje.
I can't believe that's it.	Andikholelwa ukuba yiloo nto.
Good job, thank you.	Umsebenzi omhle, enkosi.
That's hard to imagine.	Oko kunzima ukucinga.
Maybe one day you want money fast.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini ufuna imali ngokukhawuleza.
If not, he continued.	Ukuba akunjalo, waqhubeka.
Certainly not at home.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ekhaya.
And you are planning your career.	Kwaye uceba umsebenzi wakho.
And that is not the case at all.	Kwaye akunjalo kwaphela.
I will definitely be back.	Ndiza kubuya ngokuqinisekileyo.
And this is always the case.	Kwaye oku kuhlala kunjalo.
And, more often than not, it is here.	Kwaye, rhoqo kunokuba kunjalo, kunjalo apha.
If you did, good job.	Ukuba uyenzile, umsebenzi olungileyo.
You know in advance.	Uyazi ngaphambili.
It takes people a while.	Kuthatha ixesha abantu.
There was no way anyone could know.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokuba nabani na akwazi.
He found a good place to live, after that.	Wafumana indawo yokuhlala elungileyo, emva koko.
Great, great man.	Umntu omkhulu, omkhulu.
I think we need help.	Ndicinga ukuba sifuna uncedo.
Being alone is good.	Ukuba wedwa kulungile.
I know you love her.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyamthanda.
I hope it won't be hard.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akuyi kuba nzima.
He would love your help.	Angathanda uncedo lwakho.
Big, big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu, enkulu.
I can't go right away.	Andikwazi ukuya ngoko nangoko.
The old way.	Indlela endala.
And this will definitely take time.	Kwaye oku ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuthatha ixesha.
That's all you need to know.	Yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyazi.
Absolutely fine.	Kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Probably no one else tried this method.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wazama ngale ndlela.
Just about this place.	Kanye ngale ndawo.
I had to tell him something.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele into.
I'm glad you did.	Ndiyavuya kuba wenza njalo.
And maybe that would be the case for me.	Kwaye mhlawumbi bekuya kuba njalo kum.
We'll get to it, finally.	Siza kufika kuyo, ekugqibeleni.
That's the song.	Yiyo ke le ngoma.
Maybe you like something unusual.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda into engaqhelekanga.
This is a great bike.	Le ibhayisekile enkulu.
He did not stay in the area for long.	Akazange ahlale kwindawo ixesha elide.
You are so good at it.	Ungcono kakhulu kuyo.
It will be good enough.	Kuya kuba kuhle ngokwaneleyo.
Then you really have to do it.	Emva koko kufuneka wenze ngokwenene.
And they will come back again.	Kwaye baya kubuya kwakhona.
I know a lot now.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngoku.
Whatever you do right here, now.	Nokuba wenza ntoni kanye apha, ngoku.
And he went out with him.	Waza waphuma naye phandle.
I just thought.	Ndicinge nje.
But it could be me.	Kodwa inokuba ndim.
I never stayed home again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndihlale ekhaya.
I would like to do this.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza le nto.
That was the end of that.	Kwaphela ngelo xesha.
Right there .	Apho kanye .
And not just a few things.	Kwaye hayi nje izinto ezimbalwa.
So, whatever it is.	Ngoko, nokuba yintoni na.
What he wants is a plan.	Into ayifunayo licebo.
And you're good at that.	Kwaye ulungile ukuba.
You have gone too far.	Sele uhambe kakhulu.
They will all stay here.	Bonke baya kuhlala apha.
I can tell that.	Ndiyakwazi ukuxelela ngaloo nto.
That is what happened in this case.	Yiloo nto ke eyenzekayo kule meko.
Even now she didn't know much about him.	Nangoku wayengazi kangako ngaye.
He did so only a few times.	Wakwenza oko izihlandlo ezimbalwa kuphela.
Not exactly a person.	Hayi ncam umntu.
So this.	Ngoko oku.
This goes a long way.	Oku kuhamba kude kakhulu.
And now something very unusual happened.	Kwaye ngoku kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He did not know what to do first.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni kuqala.
That way .	Ngalo ndlela .
He admitted this.	Wavuma oku.
I went to the old house.	Ndiye ndaya endlini endala.
But you need help.	Kodwa ufuna uncedo.
I pretend not to notice.	Ndenza ngathi andiboni nto.
He ran after her.	Wabaleka emva kwakhe.
Thanks anyway.	Enkosi nangoku.
Some are not so easy.	Abanye akukho lula kangako.
But maybe not for long.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
He wanted his money.	Wayefuna imali yakhe.
He did not.	Akazange enze .
Not if you have ever slept.	Hayi ukuba ukhe walala.
I can't wait to do another one.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukwenza enye.
One should not do that.	Umntu akufuneki enze njalo.
They go down.	Baya phantsi.
I could not finish everything alone.	Andikwazanga ukugqiba yonke into ndedwa.
He walked over to her.	Wahamba waya kuye.
They never went to college.	Abazange baye ekholejini.
You've probably heard of him.	Mhlawumbi ukhe weva ngaye.
We, too.	Nathi, nathi.
Not in this place.	Hayi kule ndawo.
For both of us, really.	Kuthi sobabini, ngokwenene.
And look at everything that happens.	Kwaye jonga kuyo yonke into eyenzekayo.
I've talked enough.	Ndithethe ngokwaneleyo.
You want to find a place to stay and so on.	Ufuna ukufumana indawo yokuhlala njalo njalo.
He would tell her all that.	Wayeza kumxelela yonke loo nto.
But you know your mind.	Kodwa uyayazi ingqondo yakho.
He is just like everyone else now.	Ufana naye wonke umntu ngoku.
Where is the problem.	Iphi ingxaki.
However, this should not be a big deal, either.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akufuneki kube yinto enkulu, nokuba.
Maybe just kids.	Mhlawumbi abantwana nje.
He has been gone for a very long time.	Uhambe ixesha elide kakhulu.
Whatever happens is fine.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo ilungile.
And you know it too.	Kwaye uyazi nawe.
You think about it.	Ucinga ngayo.
There are, however, exceptions.	Kukho, nangona kunjalo, ngaphandle.
I never had it, of course.	Andizange ndibe nayo, kunjalo.
Then he asked about you.	Emva koko wabuza ngawe.
I have never told you everything before.	Andizange ndikuxelele yonke into ngaphambili.
And man, man.	Kwaye umntu, umntu.
He read in my room.	Wafunda egumbini lam.
I hope you are too !.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe unjalo!.
You will try to get a job.	Uza kuzama ukufumana umsebenzi.
Three hours down.	Iiyure ezintathu phantsi.
I know him now.	Ndiyamazi ngoku.
They came to him.	Baza kuye.
I'm not really sure yet.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene okwangoku.
He could not finish.	Akazange akwazi ukugqiba.
But yes, that is not possible.	Kodwa ewe, oko akunakwenzeka.
I could not buy coffee.	Andikwazanga ukuthenga ikofu.
He just wanted everything.	Wayefuna nje yonke into.
Speaking, speaking, speaking.	Ukuthetha, ukuthetha, ukuthetha.
He walked to the park.	Wahamba epakini.
Well he did.	Kulungile uye wayenza.
He did not want to help.	Wayengafuni ukunceda.
Then someone else did.	Emva koko omnye umntu wenza.
Yes, certainly enough.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
I think he wants us to leave early.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna sihambe kwangethuba.
He will not succeed.	Akayi kuphumelela.
He should have stayed with her.	Bekufanele ahlale naye.
I want to do something great.	Ndifuna ukwenza into enkulu.
I didn't really know.	Ndandingazi ngokwenene.
I don’t have to do anything big with it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndenze into enkulu ngayo.
He is already talking to her.	Sele ethetha naye.
No one said such a thing unless they wanted something.	Akukho mntu wathetha into enjalo ngaphandle kokuba wayefuna into.
I really want to go.	Ngokwenene, ndifuna ukuhamba.
And he had to stay.	Kwaye kwafuneka ahlale.
He needed time alone.	Wayefuna ixesha eyedwa.
It is impossible to think or think of anything else.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba ucinge okanye ucinge ngayo nayiphi na enye into.
But there is no danger.	Kodwa akukho ngozi.
He did not speak to anyone until he had finished.	Khange athethe mntu de wagqiba.
You have won everything.	Uphumelele yonke into.
But he had to agree.	Kodwa kwafuneka avume.
But thank you very much.	Kodwa enkosi kakhulu.
He cannot succeed.	Akanakukwazi ukuphumelela.
One is time.	Enye lixesha.
I can't wait to see how it goes tonight !.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuba kuhamba njani ngokuhlwanje!.
Not even right.	Akukho nokuba kulungile.
He was completely visible.	Wayebonakala ngokupheleleyo.
And maybe you should too.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kufuneka nawe.
So, there is no place for you.	Ngoko ke, akukho ndawo yakho.
Please come immediately.	Nceda uze ngoko nangoko.
It is very difficult to be a friend.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuba ngumhlobo.
At work, with my friends.	Ngomsebenzi, nabahlobo bam.
It will be a huge undertaking.	Kuya kuba ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
You're just tired.	Udiniwe nje.
I've always wanted one, too.	Bendisoloko ndifuna enye, nam.
The gun started coming out.	Umpu waqalisa ukuphuma.
But he decided to do it.	Kodwa wagqiba ekubeni enjenjalo.
I know right away.	Ndiyayazi ngoko nangoko.
But man, somewhere, you know.	Kodwa umntu, kwindawo ethile, uyazi.
But surely nothing will happen to him.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto iya kwenzeka kuye.
I know what happens in the end.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo ekugqibeleni.
No, no once not now.	Hayi, hayi kanye hayi ngoku.
I do my job.	Ndenza umsebenzi wam.
And he didn't want to do anything after lunch.	Kwaye wayengafuni kwenza nto emva kwesidlo sasemini.
And not just anyone.	Kwaye hayi nje umntu.
He would do it this time.	Wayeza kuyenza ngeli xesha.
Or I do not care.	Okanye andikhathali.
I hope it is okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ilungile.
To him, to her.	Kuye, kuye.
Then there is the way.	Emva koko kukho indlela.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka oko.
Any longer .	Hayi kwaphela .
Working very hard.	Ukusebenza nzima kakhulu.
Work is already underway.	Umsebenzi sele uqhuba.
Long-term performance.	Ukusebenza kwexesha elide.
The finish is not good.	Ukugqiba akukho kakuhle.
Please talk to me.	Ndicela uthethe nam.
This starts earlier.	Oku kuqala ngaphambili.
I did not really know how or why.	Ndandingazi ngokwenene ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
But okay lunch.	Kodwa kulungile isidlo sasemini.
I do not believe he will ever do that.	Andikholelwa ukuba uya kuze enze njalo.
Only.	Kuphela nje .
So, what? 	Yiyo, yintoni?
Either way is fine.	Nayiphi na indlela ilungile.
We want food.	Sifuna ukutya.
We will talk about this in your area of ​​residence.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto kwindawo yakho yokuhlala.
You have everything there.	Unayo yonke into apho.
Tom didn't, really.	UTom akazange, ngokwenene.
Not really but what exactly.	Akunjalo kodwa yintoni ngokwenene.
What the hell?!.	Yintoni?!.
I want you to know about us.	Ndifuna uyazi kuthi.
Her mother said it would be fun.	Umama wakhe uthe kuya kuba mnandi.
But this is a strange thing.	Kodwa le yinto engaqhelekanga.
Trying to make it harder.	Ukuzama ukwenza kube nzima.
My father .	Utata wam .
But he just stays.	Kodwa uhlala nje.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo bekuya kuba njalo.
It's the best thing.	Yinto engcono kakhulu.
It can also be fun.	Kwakhona kunokuba mnandi.
I would love to try to do it myself.	Ndingathanda ukuzama ukuyenza ngokwam.
I needed help, but not so bad.	Ndandifuna uncedo, kodwa hayi kakubi kangako.
All the time now.	Ixesha lonke ngoku.
You talk about me and you.	Uthetha ngam nawe.
And because.	Kwaye ngenxa .
He didn't even know why.	Wayengazi nokuba kutheni.
You can do that, you know.	Ungayenza loo nto, uyazi.
He did something wrong.	Wenza into engalunganga.
But other than that.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko.
I hope this is okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kulungile.
Want to know my name? 	Uyafuna ukwazi igama lam?
I want a job in this.	Ndifuna umsebenzi kule.
I do not remember things.	Andikhumbuli izinto.
And maybe not at all.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akukho konke konke.
All the money.	Yonke imali.
But a lot of the book has been made.	Kodwa incwadi eninzi yenziwe.
All is well .	Konke kulungile .
So you better succeed.	Ngoko kungcono uphumelele.
I don't want to say anything else.	Andifuni kuthetha enye into.
He started talking to her.	Waqalisa ukuthetha naye.
And you do that too.	Kwaye uyayenza loo nto nawe.
I will not speak again.	andiyi kuphinda ndithethe.
Not coffee for me.	Hayi ikofu kum.
And you are the only person.	Kwaye nguwe wedwa umntu .
Not now and nothing here makes sense.	Hayi ngoku kwaye akukho apha kwenza ingqondo.
He knew better than to walk fast.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
Yes, they do.	Ewe, bathi.
We'll see though.	Siza kubona nangona kunjalo.
One often does.	Umntu udla ngokwenza njalo.
When you are better.	Xa ungcono.
We will not have much time.	Asiyi kuba nexesha elininzi.
And then with it.	Kwaye emva koko kunye nayo.
They will be.	Baya kuba .
Yeah, not a joke.	Ewe, hayi ukudlala.
I thought everyone knew it.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi.
For others for a long time.	Kuba abanye ixesha elide.
I just can't meet you like that.	Andikwazi nje ukudibana nawe ngolo hlobo.
Not so bad, right ?.	Hayi into embi kangaka, akunjalo?.
So it would be nice to have you too.	Ngoko bekuya kuba mnandi ukuba nawe.
I thought, now, now.	Ndacinga, ngoku, ngoku.
Working on that, though.	Ukusebenza kuloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
Who did this?	Ngubani owenze lento.
Definitely look a little off.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ujonge kancinci.
Being alone really means that you are.	Ukuba wedwa ngokwenene kuthetha ukuba nawe.
I have no better answer.	Andinayo impendulo engcono.
But it was supposed to be.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba.
Very, very long.	Kakhulu, ixesha elide.
Let me go this way another way.	Makhe ndihambe ngale ndlela ngenye indlela.
Nobody lives here.	Akukho mntu uhlala apha.
You have to have it too.	Kufuneka ube nayo nawe.
Now not everything is here.	Ngoku akukho phantse yonke into apha.
I want to meet you.	Ndifuna ukudibana nawe.
Where did he go when?	Waya phi nini.
I wanted to do.	Ndandifuna ukwenza.
Or maybe not, really.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo, ngokwenene.
Yes, not anyone.	Ewe, hayi nabani na.
We will see .	Siza kubona .
Both parents in the area.	Bobabini abazali kwindawo.
That means there is something there.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kukho into ethile apho.
That's what needs to happen.	Yinto ekufuneka yenzeke.
I will be able to read again.	Ndiya kukwazi ukufunda kwakhona.
Not a problem.	Hayi ingxaki.
I'll tell him he's here.	Ndiza kumxelela ukuba ulapha.
Please do better here.	Nceda wenze ngcono apha.
I just know you will.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba uya kuba njalo.
He did not stay with her.	Akazange ahlale naye.
I love it for myself.	Ndiyayithanda ngokwam.
He wanted nothing from her.	Wayengafuni nto kuye.
Please let me know if this is a good idea.	Nceda undixelele ukuba oku kulungile.
If you read this far, thank you, you are right.	Ukuba ufunda oku kude, enkosi, ulungile.
I'm trying to stay away from you.	Ndizama ukuhlala kude nawe.
I think it always is.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhlala kunjalo.
Either way, that's fine.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, kulungile.
Maybe one, too.	Mhlawumbi enye, nayo.
I thought it would be hard for us.	Ndandicinga ukuba iya kuba nzima kuthi.
Why, nothing! 	Kutheni, akukho nto!
He did well with her.	Wenza kakuhle naye.
I think this may be it, but it seems like it is not.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kunokuba yiyo, kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
Now we know what it is, and what it is.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba yintoni na, kwaye yintoni na.
She has won three.	Uphumelele ezintathu.
I can't get enough.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo.
I looked at him for his work.	Ndijonge kuye umsebenzi wakhe.
How wonderful that will be!	Kuya kuba mnandi kangakanani oko.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba uyazi.
He has to tell her.	Kufuneka amxelele.
He doesn't think.	Akacingi.
Yeah, not me, maybe.	Ewe, hayi mna, mhlawumbi.
You better get there as soon as possible.	Kungcono ufike apho ngokukhawuleza.
No one else, only you.	Hayi omnye umntu, nguwe kuphela.
And when everyone appears, he too will come.	Kwaye xa wonke umntu ebonakala, naye uya kuza.
I'm afraid it is.	Ndiyoyika ukuba yiyo.
And then you go somewhere.	Kwaye emva koko uya kwindawo.
No yes, no no.	Hayi ewe, hayi hayi.
But that happened a lot.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kakhulu.
I can do all that here.	Ndingayenza yonke loo nto apha.
It can only be one thing, only one.	Inokuba yinto enye kuphela, enye kuphela.
So that's it.	Ngoko ke leyo yinto.
Maybe that would be better.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba ngcono.
If all is well.	Ukuba yonke into ilungile.
Right behind me.	Kanye emva kwam.
Driving makes it a lot easier.	Ukuqhuba kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
I don't have to do anything.	Akufuneki ndenze nantoni na.
You're right about me.	Ulungile ngam.
I know how good it can be.	Ndiyazi ukuba inokuba kuhle kangakanani.
They will come later.	Baya kuza ngasemva.
He thought for a moment.	Wacinga kancinci.
And he lives with you.	Kwaye uhlala nawe.
I don't know how long this will take.	Andazi ukuba oku kuya kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
She says thank you.	Uthi enkosi.
It seems to speak well.	Kubonakala ngathi kuthetha kakuhle.
All, probably.	Bonke, mhlawumbi.
I will, however.	Ndiza, nangona kunjalo.
I think we should do a better job.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka senze umsebenzi ongcono.
Everything is fine in a certain way.	Yonke into ilungile ngendlela ethile.
Not before.	Hayi ngaphambili.
He asked me out.	Uye wandicela phandle.
Dinner tonight, yes.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa namhlanje, ewe.
That is my job here.	Ngumsebenzi wam lowo apha.
Give me a few days.	Ndinike iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Please do not.	Nceda musa .
Sooner or later they will go there.	Kungekudala okanye kamva baya kuya apho.
I want to do this myself.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku ngokwam.
It takes good sense to do that.	Kuthatha ingqondo elungileyo ukwenza oko.
Well, that's all.	Kulungile, yiyo yonke loo nto.
And that.	Kwaye oko .
He talked to her.	Wathetha nayo.
He agreed to speak.	Wavuma ukuthetha.
Everyone else, not so much.	Bonke abanye, hayi kakhulu.
He was afraid of the man.	Wayesoyika umntu.
What do you want it to be ?.	Ufuna ukuba yintoni?.
Three in front, three in the back.	Abathathu phambili, abathathu ngasemva.
This means that if.	Oku kuthetha ukuba ukuba.
I can drive.	Ndiyakwazi ukuqhuba.
Well, how did you get there.	Ewe, ufike njani apho.
We did this so that everyone could read.	Senze loo nto ukuze wonke umntu akwazi ukufunda.
I told her last week.	Ndimxelele kwiveki ephelileyo.
I did not want to work here.	Bendingafuni ukusebenza apha.
That is true, and it is not.	Yinyani leyo, kwaye akunjalo.
I never knew how.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuba njani.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
Finally he spoke again.	Ekugqibeleni wathetha kwakhona.
As it can be anything.	Njengoko inokuba nantoni na.
I mean so.	Ndithetha njalo.
But we really want something good.	Kodwa ngokwenene sifuna into elungileyo.
Finally, he could not eat at all.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange akwazi ukutya konke konke.
I have never been so far away.	Khange ndibe kude kangaka.
You should be here.	Ufanele ukuba apha.
Such an error.	Impazamo enjalo.
He lives at that time and probably.	Uhlala ngelo xesha kwaye mhlawumbi.
We want him to go home.	Sifuna ukuba agoduke.
Yes, he will.	Ewe, uya kuthetha.
If he was scared.	Ukuba wayesoyika.
And man.	Kwaye umntu.
But it will come to you.	Kodwa iya kuza kuwe.
I will not do it again.	Andiyi kuphinda.
It will be easier to talk to you in the same way.	Kuya kuba lula ukuthetha nawe ngendlela efanayo.
You will not go all the way.	Awuyi kuhamba yonke indlela.
He did not do so immediately.	Akazange akwenze oko ngoko nangoko.
He looks better without her.	Ubonakala ungcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
I don't want to go to college.	Andifuni ukuya ekholejini.
And then the kids.	Kwaye ke abantwana.
Not now, not to him.	Hayi ngoku, hayi kuye.
I did not come here.	Khange ndize apha.
But he wouldn't let me tell him.	Kodwa akazange avume ukuba ndimxelele.
He certainly did not want to be here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengafuni ukuba lapha.
That would be great for him.	Oko kuya kuba kuhle ngaye.
He looked up.	Uye wajonga phezulu.
Probably not so much.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kakhulu.
I did this.	Ndiyenzile le nto.
So, you feel better.	Ngoko, uziva engcono.
Something happened last night.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo phezolo.
This is enough.	Oku kufuneka ngokwaneleyo.
We'll have all that tomorrow.	Siza kuba yonke loo nto ngomso.
I would like your help.	Ndingathanda ukufumana uncedo lwakho.
But life as a whole.	Kodwa ubomi ngokupheleleyo.
I wanted to be a kid.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngumntwana.
Not so, but.	Akunjalo, kodwa .
I'm not good at it yet.	Andikho mhle kuyo nangoku.
It's all right.	Yonke ilungile.
That's all right and good.	Oko konke kulungile kwaye kulungile.
He did not want to talk about it at all.	Wayengafuni tu ukuthetha ngaye.
I thought you might like that.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda oko.
I wanted you to move on.	Bendifuna uye phambili.
There is food in this situation.	Kukho ukutya kule meko.
No one is here except me.	Akukho mntu ulapha ngaphandle kwam.
We have to, we have to do it.	Kufuneka, kufuneka siyenze.
Anything for everyone.	Nantoni na wonke umntu.
Not at all, of course.	Akunjalo kwaphela, kunjalo.
And of course, he can never.	Kwaye kunjalo, akanakuze.
Me or anyone.	Mna okanye nabani na.
And I don't want to.	Kwaye andifuni.
One day he arrived late for lunch.	Ngenye imini wafika emva kwexesha kwisidlo sasemini.
I'm not sure you ever talked to me.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ukhe wathetha nam.
I can't do any of that.	Andikwazi ukwenza nayiphi na loo nto.
I will only go a week or two.	Ndiza kuhamba iveki okanye ezimbini kuphela.
I told you all this.	Ndikuxelele yonke lento.
So he started walking.	Ngoko waqalisa ukuhamba.
But he will return.	Kodwa uya kubuya .
And he knew better, of course.	Kwaye wayesazi ngcono, kunjalo.
Well, certainly not so much.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kakhulu.
I mean, sorry, no.	Ndithetha, uxolo, hayi.
Or he thought he knew.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
I can't wait to learn more from you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda ngakumbi kuwe.
Me, too, I hope.	Nam, ndiyathemba.
However, you probably should not do this.	Nangona kunjalo, mhlawumbi akufanele uyenze le nto.
This makes things much faster.	Oku kwenza izinto ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
But tell me why you came so soon.	Kodwa ndixelele ukuba kutheni uze kwangoko.
I do a lot.	Ndenza okuninzi.
Now, however, the truth will come to you.	Ngoku, nangona kunjalo, inyaniso iya kuza kuwe.
Not outside.	Hayi ngaphandle.
There is this.	Kukho oku.
He says he is.	Uthi nguye.
You mean a lot to me, you know.	Uthetha into enkulu kum, uyazi.
And they stayed.	Kwaye bahlala.
That's a big deal!	Yinto enkulu leyo!.
Nobody here will say a word.	Akukho mntu apha uya kuthetha ilizwi.
I know nothing about him.	Andiqondi nto ngaye.
Nobody wanted to stay there.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuhlala apho.
He wants us both to go.	Ufuna sihambe sobabini.
Arriving early is a good thing.	Ukufika kwangethuba yinto elungileyo.
You make money from it.	Wenza imali kuyo.
Either way, you have to do it.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, kufuneka uyenze.
You like it?.	Uyayithanda?.
Well, no I am.	Ewe, hayi mna kunjalo.
You've already done that.	Sele uyenzile loo nto.
There is nothing to do.	Akukho nto yokwenza.
It's hard for me to do something in the house.	Kunzima ukuba ndenze into endlini.
Maybe he's the only one.	Mhlawumbi nguye yedwa.
Being here and now.	Ukuba lapha kwaye ngoku.
Then he started talking.	Emva koko, waqalisa ukuthetha.
He didn't even know what to think.	Wayengazi nokuba kufuneka acinge ntoni na.
It happened today or last week.	Kwenzeke namhlanje okanye kwiveki ephelileyo.
The more effective, the better.	Ukuphumelela ngakumbi, kungcono.
He cannot learn anything immediately.	Akakwazi ukufunda nantoni na ngokukhawuleza.
I'm sorry to be human.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokuba ngumntu.
So all in all, a good restaurant.	Ngoko konke, indawo yokutyela elungileyo.
I stole food from him.	Ndibe ukutya kuye.
And there is no passing of time.	Kwaye akukho kuhamba kwexesha.
Down this week.	Phantsi kule veki.
And you know what exactly.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
That's what it is to us.	Yiloo nto ke kuthi.
Yes, everyone.	Ewe, bonke.
Another thing to do.	Enye into yokwenza.
But he wanted a job.	Kodwa wayefuna umsebenzi.
????.	????.
Not there yet.	Akukho apho kodwa.
He knew he could do it.	Wayesazi ukuba angayenza.
Not just his life.	Hayi nje ubomi bakhe.
I can't really swim.	Andikwazi nyani ukuqubha.
And then, about this time.	Kwaye ke, malunga nexesha le.
He did not do his homework.	Akazange enze umsebenzi wasekhaya.
If he took his life.	Ukuba wathatha ubomi bakhe.
Or whatever you have to do.	Okanye nantoni na ekufuneka uyenzile.
Her mother is another way.	Umama wakhe ngenye indlela.
Soon she will get another one.	Kungekudala iza kufumana enye.
I'm not sure there's a better way.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho indlela engcono.
I'm happy too.	Nam ndiyavuya.
All before lunch.	Konke ngaphambi kwesidlo sasemini.
However, something wonderful happened.	Kodwa ke, kwenzeka into entle.
I wanted almost anything at the time.	Ndandifuna phantse nantoni na ngelo xesha.
It's hard but it will definitely get better.	Kunzima kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba ngcono.
I really want to learn to do everything.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukufunda ukwenza yonke into.
I never thought it would be good for me.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kum.
He really did not need to do that.	Ngokwenene kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba enze loo nto.
Back, forward, slowly.	Emva, phambili, kancinci.
She is definitely good.	Ulungile ngokuqinisekileyo.
Does anyone want food?	Ngaba kukho umntu ofuna ukutya?
And this is probably okay.	Kwaye oku mhlawumbi kulungile.
But for now, it's just me and you.	Kodwa okwangoku, ndim nawe kuphela.
One knows or does not know.	Umntu uyazi okanye akazi.
He does not need to know anything about it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba azi ngale enye into.
Well, you know it fast enough.	Ewe, uyazi ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
He did well with it.	Wenza kakuhle ngayo.
No one talks to me much.	Akukho mntu uthetha nam kakhulu.
We will not need anything after that.	Asiyi kufuna nto emva koko.
Work or something.	Umsebenzi okanye enye into.
Not what happened.	Hayi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And maybe he's a very good person, too.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ungumntu olungileyo kakhulu, naye.
Well, not just me.	Ewe, hayi mna kuphela.
Don't go without me.	Musa ukuhamba ngaphandle kwam.
What do you have to think about me.	Kufuneka ucinga ntoni ngam .
And exactly.	Kwaye kanye kanye.
Always okay.	Rhoqo kulungile.
But neither did he.	Kodwa naye akazange.
However, this seems difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kubonakala kunzima.
Because everyone loves a good party !.	Kuba wonke umntu uthanda itheko elihle!.
I'm afraid you're saying the wrong thing.	Ndiyoyika ukuba uthetha into engalunganga.
You don't have to go there.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uye apho.
He opened the door and walked out.	Wavula ucango waphuma.
It's coming to you now.	Iza kuwe ngoku.
If you want something else.	Ukuba ufuna enye into .
About how hard it is.	Malunga nokuba kunzima kangakanani na.
It would be nice to have him.	Bekuya kuba mnandi ukuba naye.
He looked behind her.	Ukhe wajonga emva kwakhe.
I heard something then, a little bit.	Ndeva into ngoko, kancinci.
That's right, always.	Kunjalo, rhoqo.
Down there, look now.	Phantsi phaya, jonga ngoku .
Parents will go shopping.	Abazali baya kuthenga.
All your work.	Wonke umsebenzi wakho.
I don't want to go to school.	Andifuni ukuya esikolweni.
Just things.	Izinto nje.
He stayed there for only a few weeks.	Wahlala apho kuphela iiveki ezimbalwa.
So, please look at your dates.	Ngoko, nceda ujonge imihla yakho.
Speaking too fast.	Ukuthetha ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
My mother said yes.	Umama uthe ewe.
I think it can be very fun.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba mnandi kakhulu.
Or maybe both.	Okanye mhlawumbi bobabini.
That makes it easier to stop the car.	Oko kwenza kube lula ukuyeka imoto.
He walked away from me.	Wemka phambi kwam.
Now we have to do it again.	Ngoku kufuneka siyenze kwakhona.
Slowly but surely.	Kancinci kodwa phantsi.
Well, for me then.	Kulungile, kum ke.
And there is something wrong with her.	Kwaye kukho into embi kuye.
And always.	Kwaye rhoqo .
And finally, the message.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, umyalezo.
One problem at a time.	Ingxaki enye ngelo xesha.
Marriage can be.	Umtshato usenokuba .
But this time I can't.	Kodwa ngeli xesha andikwazi.
Well, it's time again.	Ewe, lixesha kwakhona.
And you bought something good.	Kwaye uthenge into entle.
There you did very well.	Apho wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Well, this is not the case.	Kulungile, oku akunjalo.
Then, it takes more than that to succeed.	Emva koko, kuthatha ngaphezu koko ukuphumelela.
You have to have it for yourself.	Kufuneka ube nayo kuwe.
You know you have a place here anytime.	Uyazi ukuba unayo indawo apha nanini na.
You definitely feel better.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uziva engcono.
Or they will.	Okanye baya kwenza njalo.
Then you want something else.	Emva koko ufuna enye into.
I will never do that again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndiyenze loo nto.
He wants to know what happened.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
So it will happen.	Ngoko kuya kwenzeka.
At first he thought he was asleep.	Ekuqaleni wacinga ukuba ulele.
That will always be the case.	Oko kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
He just did the right thing.	Wenza nje into entle.
I think that's true, by the way.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani, ngendlela.
Something is happening here.	Into eyenzekayo apha.
Do not talk about any of them.	Musa ukuthetha ngayo nayiphi na kuyo.
She wanted to stay in her room.	Wayefuna ukuhlala kwigumbi lakhe.
Great man now.	Umntu omkhulu ngoku.
Maybe in a week or so.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki okanye njalo.
It’s even harder that way, for sure.	Kunzima ngakumbi ngaloo ndlela, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I thought he was as smart as I was.	Ndandicinga ukuba ukrelekrele njengam.
It doesn't have to be.	Akufunekanga ukuba yenziwe.
I can't stay in bed all day.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ebhedini imini yonke.
This has to happen well.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke kakuhle.
I think nothing.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho nto.
His wife knows it, too.	Umfazi wakhe uyayazi, naye.
I did not speak to you.	Andizange ndithethe nawe.
It really is ours.	Yinyani yethu ngokwenene.
There is a tomorrow.	Kukho ngomso.
There are others here.	Kukho ezinye apha.
He did not know why or how.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni okanye njani.
Yes, it does not hurt.	Ewe, hayi buhlungu.
You probably already know about it.	Usenokuba sele uyazi ngayo.
You have to be the only problem.	Kufuneka ube yedwa ingxaki.
Now he is working hard.	Ngoku usebenza nzima.
He knows all this.	Uyayazi yonke le nto.
But this seems to us.	Kodwa oku kubonakala ngathi.
Again, thank you for doing this.	Kwakhona, enkosi ngokwenza oku.
And you think about him.	Kwaye ucinga ngaye.
Today, except tomorrow.	Namhlanje, ngaphandle ngomso.
But now it's time to go to bed.	Kodwa ngoku lixesha lokulala.
At home for dinner.	Ekhaya isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Yes a little money is fine.	Ewe imali encinci ilungile.
Give me that.	Ndinike lonto.
No one wanted to say anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nantoni na.
Very good name, though.	Igama elihle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
Thanks to me, you live alone.	Enkosi kum, uhleli yedwa.
Yes, he would come in time.	Ewe wayeza kufika kwangethuba.
Yes that would be great.	Ewe oko kuya kuba kuhle.
I wanted to talk to you though.	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe kodwa.
This is definitely a thing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo le yinto.
It's weeks.	Ingaba iiveki.
At first, he is invisible.	Ekuqaleni, akabonakali kwaphela.
I can't go with him.	Andikwazi ukuhamba naye.
Tomorrow we will see.	Ngomso siza kubona.
But it was not.	Kodwa kwakungekho.
She's good to have him.	Ulungile ukuba naye.
But he will not speak.	Kodwa akayi kuthetha.
We had a great time.	Senze ixesha elihle kakhulu.
When you are here.	Xa ulapha.
I think so.	Ndicinga ngolo hlobo.
You did the right thing, but you know it.	Wenza into elungileyo, kodwa uyayazi loo nto.
That's me now.	Ndim lowo ngoku.
Alone.	Ndedwa nje.
It seemed to live in it.	Kwakubonakala kuhlala kuyo.
But you do not have to be alone.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba ube wedwa.
I try to do it right for you.	Ndizama ukuyenza kakuhle ngawe.
Now you know !.	Ngoku uyazi!.
I came here to the house.	Ndifike apha endlini.
There, he asked for help.	Apho, wacela uncedo.
My father is here.	Utata ulapha.
and everything.	nayo yonke into.
It can be a good thing or a bad thing.	Inokuba yinto entle okanye embi.
I've just said a few.	Ndithethe nje ezimbalwa.
He did not want to talk more.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngakumbi.
Learning to study in college.	Ukufunda ukufunda ekholejini.
He’s a great guy there.	Ungumntu omkhulu apho.
You never talked about it.	Awuzange uthethe ngayo.
What he knew all along.	Oko wayesazi ngalo lonke ixesha.
That comes tomorrow.	Oko kuza ngomso.
Everyone knows everyone well.	Wonke umntu uyazi kakuhle wonke umntu.
In the car, very late at night.	Emotweni, ebusuku kakhulu.
Yeah, maybe for now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi okwangoku.
I have to learn something.	Kufuneka ndifunde into.
He knew he had to.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ukuba kulungile.
That will end now.	Oko kuya kuphela ngoku.
But we do not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba siyenze ngolo hlobo.
See what happens to you.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
It is not easy at all.	Akukho lula kwaphela.
Everyone is hopeful.	Wonke umntu unethemba.
When you eat you feel better.	Xa utya uziva ngcono.
Do not try to be like him.	Musa ukuzama indlela efanayo naye.
Because that is what happened.	Kuba oko kwenzeka.
It happens, often.	Kwenzeka, rhoqo.
But even then it is not easy.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo akukho lula.
But now, he is afraid.	Kodwa ngoku, uyoyika.
I like it no.	Ndiyayithanda hayi.
He spoke strongly.	Wathetha ngamandla.
I have to do some work there.	Kufuneka ndenze umsebenzi phaya.
I said nothing for sure.	Andizange ndithethe nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
This goes the same way.	Oku kuhamba ngendlela efanayo.
I doubt this is the case, though.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba oku kunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
There are flowers everywhere.	Kukho iintyatyambo kuyo yonke indawo.
Not yet, not now.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ngoku.
I will go there.	Ndiza kuya apho.
His work is just like me.	Umsebenzi wakhe ufana nje nam.
But about all the same.	Kodwa malunga nayo yonke into efanayo.
Of course he knew nothing about me.	Ewe wayengazi nto ngam.
I feel more human than I am.	Ndiziva ndingumntu ngakumbi kum.
Another thing is to know.	Enye into kukwazi.
Tell me, now.	Ndixelele, ngoku.
When you work it is very difficult.	Xa usebenza kunzima kakhulu.
Mother, too.	Umama, naye.
I did not tell my mother.	Khange ndimxelele umama.
As he knew he would do.	Njengoko wayesazi ukuba uya kwenza.
There is more possible with it.	Kukho kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ngayo.
He came in late.	Wangena late.
Outside, after all.	Ngaphandle, emva koko.
I know how hard it is.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani.
Man exactly.	Umntu kanye.
We will see!.	Siza kubona!.
I did it completely myself.	Ndenze ngokwam ngokupheleleyo.
That's the house.	Nantso indlu.
Then everything is fine.	Emva koko yonke into ilungile.
You will buy soon.	Uya kuthenga ngokukhawuleza.
Right here now, next to me.	Kanye apha ngoku, ecaleni kwam.
I did not want this to happen to him.	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke kuye le nto.
It is the same with us all.	Kunjalo nathi sonke.
But with that we will talk later.	Kodwa ngaloo nto siza kuthetha kamva.
It is your only hope.	Lithemba lakho kuphela.
One problem is that.	Ingxaki enye kukuba .
Now it is you.	Ngoku nguwe.
It's just hard to walk.	Kunzima nje ukuhamba.
And not just him.	Kwaye hayi kuye kuphela.
I asked to try.	Ndacela ukuzama.
I had to wait a long time.	Kwafuneka ndilinde ixesha elide.
No one said anything.	Akukho mntu uthethe nto.
Then he fled the scene.	Emva koko wabaleka kuloo ndawo.
He should have wanted me by now.	Bekufanele ukuba sele endifuna ngoku.
I have never told anyone about it before.	Andizange ndixelele mntu ngayo ngaphambili.
I know.	Mna ndiyazi.
Again, there was nothing.	Kwakhona, kwakungekho nto.
Well, not his bedroom.	Ewe, hayi igumbi lakhe lokulala.
I feel bad about it like you do.	Ndiziva kakubi ngayo njengawe.
You know what you want to do.	Uyayazi into ofuna ukuyenza.
Eventually you will get it.	Ekugqibeleni uya kufumana .
He could no longer control himself.	Akazange aphinde akwazi ukuzibamba.
I did really well.	Ndenze kakuhle ngokwenene.
You today, me tomorrow.	Wena namhlanje, mna ngomso.
But what’s out.	Kodwa yintoni ukuphuma.
And soon, he will be.	Kwaye kungekudala, uya kuba.
Or the other way around.	Okanye enye indlela.
It is best to look at your living space around it.	Kungcono ujonge indawo yakho yokuhlala malunga nayo.
No it isn't .	Hayi, akunjalo .
No, you told her.	Hayi, umxelele.
I did the same thing.	Nam ndenze into efanayo.
I didn't really want to.	Ndandingafuni nyani.
But, it was not good.	Kodwa, kwakungekho kuhle.
Everyone wants to go where everyone knows their name.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuya apho wonke umntu azi igama lakhe.
But he does not know such a thing.	Kodwa akayazi into enjalo.
It is very difficult to get out.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuphuma.
Just up.	Nje phezulu.
He gave me all this.	Wandinika yonke lento.
I really wanted to meet you.	Bendifuna kakhulu ukudibana nawe.
Well, we know that is not the case.	Ewe, siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I don't know how, exactly.	Andazi ukuba njani, kanye.
Then he was alone again.	Emva koko waba yedwa kwakhona.
You never really tried.	Zange wazama ngokwenene.
Almost no one does that.	Phantse akukho mntu wenza oko.
I've always wanted to meet you.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukudibana nawe.
All right, all right, all right.	Kunjalo, kulungile, kulungile.
That is likely to end soon.	Oko kusenokwenzeka ukuba kuya kuphela kungekudala.
He has to do it his way.	Kufuneka ayenze ngendlela yakhe.
Just another one.	Enye nje enye.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba licebo elihle elo.
I know you can be better.	Ndiyazi ukuba unokuba ngcono.
You know about him.	Uyazi ngaye.
And time is not needed.	Kwaye ixesha akufuneki.
I'm glad to be here with you.	Ndiyavuya ukuba lapha nam.
They say it's not necessary.	Bathi akuyomfuneko.
But she could not decide.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
It makes it hard to play.	Kwenza kube nzima ukudlala.
But clearly.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo.
For me maybe.	Kum mhlawumbi.
He will never do it again.	Akayi kuyenza kwakhona.
I can't sing.	Andikwazi ukucula.
That's my doing.	Kukwenza kwam oko.
Let me talk to you first.	Makhe ndithethe nawe kuqala.
So he would be back soon.	Ngoko wayeza kubuya kungekudala.
He entered immediately.	Wangena kwangoko.
And he felt the need to do so.	Kwaye waziva efuna ukuba enze njalo.
That was my first job.	Ngumsebenzi wam wokuqala lowo.
But you can be.	Kodwa usenokuba .
Such a small amount of money.	Imali encinci enjalo.
He is coming for you.	Uza ngenxa yakho.
Then,.	Emva koko, .
There was no place to sit down.	Kwakungekho ndawo yokuhlala phantsi.
You will be sad tomorrow.	Uzakuba buhlungu ngomso.
Just now, .	Ngoku, .
Maybe he fell asleep.	Mhlawumbi walala.
I know that very well.	Ndiyayazi loo nto kakhulu.
Not really, as it were.	Akunjalo ngokwenene, njengokuba kunjalo.
And he doesn't like that.	Kwaye akayithandi loo nto.
He says there is no need.	Uthi akukho mfuneko.
My son is a monkey.	Unyana wam nyani.
Going out for dinner.	Ukuphuma kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
But no one asked me any questions.	Kodwa akukho mntu wandibuza imibuzo.
He finally arrived.	Wafika ekugqibeleni.
Nobody thought we were going anywhere.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ukuba siya ndawo.
It will be something to do.	Iya kuba yinto yokwenza.
Although I do.	Nangona nam.
A few things about that.	Izinto ezimbalwa ngaloo nto.
It was not fun for him.	Kwakungekho mnandi kuye.
Very good together.	Kuhle kakhulu kunye.
Maybe this time, he thought.	Mhlawumbi ngeli xesha, wacinga.
Or maybe next week will be better.	Okanye mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo iya kuba ngcono.
Or any way to do this.	Okanye nayiphi na indlela yokwenza oku.
He also did not speak.	Naye khange athethe.
Another time, then.	Elinye ixesha, ngoko.
And that's all true.	Kwaye yonke loo nto yinyani.
They will all come to us sooner or later.	Bonke baya kuza kuthi kungekudala okanye kamva.
He lived with her.	Wayehlala naye.
He doesn't have to do anything big about this.	Akufunekanga enze into enkulu ngale nto.
I'm glad to have him.	Ndiyavuya ukuba naye.
At the moment, there was nothing.	Okwangoku, kwakungekho nto.
I will stay where you live.	Ndiya kuhlala apho uhlala khona.
And, really good.	Kwaye, ilungile ngokwenene.
This is my truth.	Le yinyani yam.
He knew what that would be like.	Wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njani oko.
But you can't tell anyone that.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuxelela nabani na loo nto.
He makes it very easy.	Wenza kube lula kakhulu.
He left immediately after that.	Wemka kwangoko emva koko.
Thank you very much, college.	Enkosi kakhulu, ekholejini.
He knew this was going to happen.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
Every day .	Yonke imihla .
And again, to go.	Kwaye kwakhona, ukuhamba.
He started doing something else.	Waqalisa ukwenza enye into.
I was thinking about you all the time.	Bendicinga ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
I don't know more than that.	Andazi ngaphezu koko.
He knows everything about her.	Uyayazi yonke into yakhe.
I didn’t know, really.	Ndandingazi, ngokwenene.
You must be here now.	Kumele ukuba ulapha ngoku.
Please come right away.	Nceda uze kwangoko.
Not that he knew why.	Akunjalo ukuba wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
He didn't want to think about it again.	Wayengafuni kuphinda acinge ngayo.
He agreed to say yes.	Wavuma ukuba ewe.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba azame into entsha.
Of course .	Kunjalo .
You can only sing.	Uyakwazi ukucula kuphela.
Everyone got down there.	Wonke umntu wehla apho.
He kept talking a little.	Waqhubeka ethetha kancinci.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enjenjalo.
I better do it someday.	Kungcono ndiyenze ngenye imini.
There is more than that clearly.	Kukho ngaphezu koko ngokucacileyo.
No, you need to do a test.	Hayi, kufuneka wenze uvavanyo.
Well, now, that's right.	Ewe, ngoku, kunjalo.
My father did that.	Wayenza lonto utata.
Or I did not think so.	Okanye khange ndicinge njalo.
I want you to stay there.	Ndifuna uhlale apho.
Now to find a place.	Ngoku ukufumana indawo.
I don't care how much you make.	Andikhathali nokuba wenza malini.
The doctor will not be long.	Ugqirha akayi kuba lixesha elide.
I wanted to say something.	Bendifuna ukuthetha into.
My wife more.	Umfazi wam ngakumbi.
It should have been harder.	Bekufanele kube nzima ngakumbi.
It is needed here.	Kufuneka apha.
I know a great place.	Ndiyazi indawo enkulu.
But this time, everyone came in.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, wonke umntu wangena.
He has opened.	Uye wavula.
But something happened here.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo apha.
His mother, of course.	Umama wakhe, kunjalo.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza oko.
He looked around the house.	Wajonga yonke indlu.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko ke, kulungile.
Now all is well.	Ngoku konke kulungile.
He seldom tries one way alone.	Akafane azame indlela enye eyedwa.
She is afraid to be alone.	Uyoyika ukuba yedwa.
He had never had it before.	Akazange abe nayo ngaphambili.
Me, too.	Nam, mhlawumbi.
I'm already tired.	Sele ndidiniwe.
But there is a problem there.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki apho.
I know what needs to happen.	Ndiyayazi into ekufuneka yenzeke.
So does everyone else.	Ngoko ke bonke abanye.
This one .	Le .
Please look at all my work.	Ndicela ujonge umsebenzi wam wonke.
It seems to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi yinyani.
I just have to wait.	Kufuneka ndilinde kuphela.
It is better to stay indoors.	Kungcono ukuhlala ngaphakathi.
You may be expecting too much.	Usenokuba ulindele kakhulu.
He said he did not speak.	Wathi akazange athethe.
It was clear what was going to happen.	Kwakucacile ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
I want it right now.	Ndifuna okwangoku.
Coffee or something in the back.	Ikofu okanye into phaya emva.
He drives a lot.	Uqhuba kakhulu.
There you and I are.	Nantso mna nawe.
Just knowing he didn’t know enough.	Ukwazi nje ukuba wayengazi ngokwaneleyo.
I know this better than anyone else.	Ndiyayazi le nto ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
Another time .	Elinye ixesha .
He didn't think why.	Akazange acinge ukuba kutheni.
I have never done such a thing yet.	Andizange ndiyenze into enjalo kodwa.
That will be for all of us.	Oko kuya kuthi sonke.
Really doing things.	Ngokwenene ukwenza izinto.
I had to stay well.	Kwafuneka ndihlale kakuhle.
Another mistake and going to jail.	Enye impazamo kwaye uya entolongweni.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba ucinge.
In his work, he had to.	Emsebenzini wakhe, kwafuneka ukuba.
Except for one day when he did not.	Ngaphandle kwemini enye xa engazange.
No one should have it all.	Akukho mntu ufanele abe nayo yonke.
And you will know.	Kwaye uya kukwazi.
Well done .	Wenze kakuhle .
See what he is doing to us.	Jonga sele esenza ntoni kuthi.
You should, too !.	Kufuneka, nawe!.
Really doing something else.	Ngokwenene ukwenza enye into.
He will do better, he promised.	Uza kwenza ngcono, wathembisa.
Well, look at you.	Ewe, jonga wena.
Making it real.	Ukwenza kube yinyani.
He can never stay there.	Akanakuze ahlale apho.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba akukho.
Or to stay that way.	Okanye ukuba uhlale unjalo.
He was left alone.	Wayesele yedwa.
Probably a few more.	Mhlawumbi ezimbalwa ngaphezu koko.
You will definitely get angry.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba nomsindo.
I am a mother now.	Ndim umama ngoku.
I never thought to talk about it.	Andizange ndicinge ukuthetha ngayo.
Man lives alone.	Umntu uhlala yedwa.
I decided to stay with her.	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndihlale nayo.
I can't say that enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha oko ngokwaneleyo.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ayenze loo nto.
All right, you.	Kulungile, wena .
I hope you will stay with me.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala nam.
But that, of course, is not the case.	Kodwa oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
I want you to go there.	Ndifuna uye phaya.
I will not repeat his mistake.	Andiyi kuphinda impazamo yakhe.
I know nothing about him.	Andazi kwanto ngaye.
But he never told me why.	Kodwa akazange andixelele isizathu.
You talk about this all the time.	Uthetha ngale nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
Not your marriage.	Hayi umtshato wakho.
Something like this here.	Into enje apha.
Even just.	Nokuba nje.
Then he decided it would be better inside with him.	Emva koko wagqiba ukuba kuya kuba ngcono ngaphakathi kunye naye.
Do not say such a thing.	Musa ukuthetha into enjalo.
He was leaving tomorrow.	Wayeza kuhamba kusasa.
I want a wife.	Ndifuna umfazi.
I don't know what will happen next.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
He did something with her.	Wenza into naye.
Yes, indeed, it is possible.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, oko kunokwenzeka.
I had to get late.	Kwafuneka ndifike late.
Now tell me something.	Ngoku ndixelele into.
Well, not exactly.	Kulungile, akunjalo ncam.
I know you did this.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyenzile le nto.
And certainly not for you.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kuwe.
I never said that.	Andizange ndithethe ngolo hlobo.
I wanted a girl.	Ndandifuna intombi.
It seemed like what it was.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yintoni.
I think there is.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho.
You will not have another.	Awuyi kuba naye omnye.
He did not need to know anything.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba azi nto.
I am here asking for help.	Ndilapha ndicela uncedo.
He was not there every day.	Wayengekho yonke imihla.
This one, though.	Lo, nangona kunjalo.
And he did a very good job.	Kwaye wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
Not in the car.	Hayi emotweni.
I'm just not sure if you look like him.	Andiqinisekanga nje ukuba ufana naye.
Which for sure.	Nto leyo ngokuqinisekileyo.
And look at you.	Kwaye jonga wena.
But, more on that, later.	Kodwa, ngakumbi malunga naloo nto, kamva.
I really want to do it.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza.
This would be great for me.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle kum.
Or others.	Okanye abanye.
There is always someone, too.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kukho umntu, naye.
And then, yes, again.	Kwaye ke, ewe, kwakhona.
No, not alone.	Hayi, hayi yedwa.
The truth is that you are not going.	Inyaniso kukuba awuyi.
Not waiting for something else.	Hayi ukulinda enye into.
That is not all.	Ayisiyiyo yonke loo nto.
We'll be home soon.	Siza kufika ekhaya ngokukhawuleza.
It can really be painful.	Ngokwenene kunokuba buhlungu.
You will get an immediate response.	Uya kufumana impendulo ngokukhawuleza.
I'd just like to talk about that.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngaloo nto kuphela.
No, look down.	Hayi, jonga phantsi.
He left completely.	Wemka ngokupheleleyo.
Now it's not up.	Ngoku akukho phezulu.
I made a new one.	Ndenze entsha.
Her mother had to get to work early.	Umama wakhe kwafuneka afike kwangethuba emsebenzini.
To me, yes.	Kum, ewe.
It is clear why this is so.	Kucacile ukuba kutheni oku kunjalo.
After lunch, he left alone.	Emva kwesidlo sasemini, wahamba yedwa.
Now it was all clear.	Ngoku kwakucacile konke.
He opened the door and turned on the light.	Wavula ucango wavula isibane.
He is not here, but.	Akakho apha, kodwa .
Probably not, sorry.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, uxolo.
Especially every day.	Ngakumbi yonke imihla.
He works outside.	Usebenza ngaphandle.
He found a place right in front of him and entered.	Wafumana indawo kanye ngaphambili waza wangena.
But there is one small thing he would like you to do.	Kodwa kukho into encinci angathanda ukuba uyenze.
We will have to do a lot more.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba senze okuninzi ngakumbi.
So, it takes a lot of time.	Ngoko ke, kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
You eat food.	Utya ukutya.
You can not know.	Awukwazi ukwazi.
If you read this, you will probably find out why.	Ukuba ufunda oku, mhlawumbi uya kufumana ukuba kutheni.
I'm glad we don't have to do it.	Ndiyavuya kuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba siyenze.
Good enough, really.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, ngokwenene.
Just after we did.	Kanye emva kokuba senze.
And we won't tell him either.	Kwaye nathi asiyi kumxelela.
He once had everything.	Wakhe waba nayo yonke into.
Most meals take place in the afternoon and in the evening.	Ukutya okuninzi kwenzeka emva kwemini ukuya ngokuhlwa.
We will continue as soon as possible.	Siza kuqhubeka ngokukhawuleza.
I'm tired .	Ndidiniwe .
I really thought.	Ngokwenene ndacinga.
Maybe he'll be here tonight.	Mhlawumbi uzakuba lapha ngokuhlwanje.
I will come with you.	Ndiza kuza nawe.
I don’t want to do this though.	Andifuni ukwenza oku nangona kunjalo.
Just tell me when and where.	Ndixelele nje ukuba nini kwaye phi.
Yeah, for now, that's right.	Ewe, okwangoku, kunjalo.
I would like a gun.	Ndifuna umpu.
Then speak.	Uze uthethe.
Not every day, but always.	Hayi yonke imihla, kodwa rhoqo.
And you, too.	Kwaye nawe, kunye naye.
And learning is very difficult.	Kwaye ukufunda nzima kakhulu.
I will definitely do it again and again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kwenza kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
Or last week.	Okanye kwiveki ephelileyo.
I thought he was right.	Ndandicinga ukuba ulungile.
He is looking for death.	Ujonge ukufa.
The answer is no one.	Impendulo akukho mntu.
The food is very good.	Ukutya kuhle kakhulu.
You want to think about it as little as possible.	Ufuna ukucinga ngayo kancinci kangangoko.
It's not just about.	Akunjalo nje malunga .
Such a thing is so.	Into enjalo kunjalo.
Not too much, not too little.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kancinci kakhulu.
Great response.	Impendulo kakhulu.
And soon it will not be.	Kwaye kungekudala akuyi kuba .
This is good for you.	Oku kuhle kuwe.
Anything to simplify it.	Nantoni na yokwenza lula kuyo.
Then he started working.	Emva koko waqalisa ukusebenza.
And they say often enough.	Kwaye bathi rhoqo ngokwaneleyo.
I will be shopping here again soon.	Ndiza kuthenga apha kwakhona kungekudala.
Now is good.	Ngoku KULUNGILE.
What are you waiting for.	Ulindele ntoni.
You really are playing inside of him.	Ngokwenene udlala ngaphakathi kuye.
But he was also afraid.	Kodwa naye wayesoyika.
And this happens all the time.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
And you know.	Kanye nawe uyazi.
Or why.	Okanye kwakutheni.
I wanted everything right away.	Ndandifuna yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
But it was worth it.	Kodwa bekufanele.
I asked for help everywhere.	Ndacela uncedo kuyo yonke indawo.
Indeed, it would be.	Ngokwenene, bekuya kuba njalo.
And then really go to work !.	Kwaye ke ngenene ukuya emsebenzini!.
He can't get out of bed tomorrow.	Akakwazi ukuphuma ebhedini kusasa.
I did not want to wait until tomorrow.	Bendingafuni ukulinda kude kube ngomso.
Not exactly.	Akunjalo kanye.
And he could not stop.	Kwaye akazange akwazi ukuyeka.
I thought it was a good idea to think that.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto entle ukucinga leyo.
Unless he found a way.	Ngaphandle kokuba wafumana indlela.
He did not know why he had not thought of it before.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni engazange acinge ngayo ngaphambili.
In the end, it is well done.	Ekugqibeleni, yenziwe kakuhle.
You do not have to think that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ucinge ngaloo nto.
And that means a lot.	Kwaye oko kuthetha kakhulu.
I don't have to have it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ndibe nayo.
Or do another one.	Okanye wenze enye.
You can be anyone.	Unokuba nabani na.
You told her about it.	Umxelele ngayo.
But the image will not be.	Kodwa umfanekiso awuyi kuba.
I'm glad you came here for me.	Ndiyavuya kuba uze apha kum.
And that is not possible.	Kwaye oko akunakwenzeka.
Unless you will say no.	Ngaphandle kokuba awuyi kuthetha.
But for now, no.	Kodwa okwangoku, hayi.
You will find friends.	Uya kufumana abahlobo.
I have not seen him since.	Khange ndimbone mva nje.
My son was angry.	Unyana wam waba nomsindo.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni na.
I want to buy a new car.	Ndifuna ukuthenga imoto entsha.
You just think about him.	Ucinga nje ngaye.
It will be easier and simpler.	Kuya kuba lula kwaye kube lula.
I knew one thing but.	Ndandisazi into enye kodwa.
Father, mother, daughter.	Utata, umama, intombi.
I really couldn't speak.	Ngenene andikwazanga ukuthetha.
This is certainly not possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akunakwenzeka.
But all is well now.	Kodwa konke kulungile ngoku.
Almost all.	Phantse bonke.
He is like me now.	Ufana nam ngoku.
There is something.	Kukho into .
It can be anyone he wants.	Inokuba nguye nabani na ayifunayo.
It only takes time.	Kuthatha nje ixesha.
I can't go to the party.	Andikwazi ukuya epatini.
Maybe only a few hours.	Mhlawumbi kuphela iiyure ezimbalwa.
If you live here, it will be even more painful.	Ukuba uhlala apha, kuya kuba buhlungu ngakumbi.
So here's the thing.	Ngoko ke le nto.
And there is truth in that, yes.	Kwaye kukho inyani kuloo nto, ewe.
I wanted a better bike.	Bendifuna ibhayisekile engcono.
Man, people.	Umntu, abantu.
And obviously not.	Kwaye ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He felt so much better now.	Waziva engcono kakhulu ngoku.
Helping others.	Ukunceda abanye.
I can't decide right now.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo okwangoku.
He is still the same.	Unjalo nangoku.
I'm talking about tonight.	Ndithetha malunga ngokuhlwanje.
The problem, then, is anyone.	Ingxaki, kunjalo nabani na.
It seems hard and difficult.	Kubonakala ngathi kunzima kwaye kunzima.
By your age you probably know that.	Ngeminyaka yakho ngokuqinisekileyo uyayazi loo nto.
But up.	Kodwa phezulu.
We better do something.	Kungcono senze into.
I'm glad he's here today.	Ndiyavuya kuba elapha namhlanje.
I hope they do.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuyenza.
Well, yes, you can do that.	Kulungile, ewe, ungayenza loo nto.
Only that will take time, and no time.	Kuphela oko kuya kuthatha ixesha, kwaye akukho xesha.
I wanted to come.	Bendifuna ukuza.
So yes that's exactly it.	Ngoko ewe yiloo nto ngokwenene.
Because it is you.	Ngokuba nguwe.
He knows more than that.	Wazi ngaphezu koko.
I know it is very difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
You have to be a good doctor.	Ufanele ukuba ngugqirha olungileyo.
This is not the case at all.	Ayisiyiyo le nto kwaphela.
And you have already done a lot.	Kwaye sele wenze okuninzi.
I can't speak for you.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngenxa yakho.
I go outside.	Ndiya ngaphandle.
That means you have succeeded here.	Oko kuthetha ukuba uphumelele apha.
So clearly that is possible.	Ngoko ngokucacileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
If he returned home.	Ukuba wabuyela ekhaya.
He ran away from me.	Wabaleka kum.
I can't wait to sit down again.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuhlala kwakhona.
Tom can be funny and angry.	UTom unokuba mnandi kwaye abe nomsindo.
Please do so !.	Nceda wenze njalo!.
This, however, is not very pleasant.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akukho mnandi kakhulu.
He told me how I did this.	Undixelele ukuba ndenze njani oku.
Very, very little.	Kakhulu, kancinci kakhulu.
Maybe you do, too.	Mhlawumbi uyayenza, nawe.
You are already doing it.	Sele uyenza.
Then you will clearly see what is going on.	Emva koko uya kubona ngokucacileyo ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
She went to her room.	Waya egumbini lakhe.
Clearly, something unusual was happening.	Kucacile ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo.
They say so.	Bathi kunjalo.
But this is good enough.	Kodwa oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
He also did not eat anything.	Naye akazange atye nto.
I never thought of you.	Zange ndicinge ngawe.
Gaining life in the end.	Ukufumana ubomi ekugqibeleni.
And now, at last, he came to her.	Kwaye ngoku, ekugqibeleni, weza kuye.
Neither did you.	Nawe awuzange.
We'll go, tomorrow.	Siza kuhamba, ngomso.
I never went to it.	Andizange ndihambe kuyo.
You will go alone.	Uya kuhamba wedwa.
Although something is wrong.	Nangona kukho into engalunganga.
My death will come to an end.	Ukufa kwam kuya kufika ekugqibeleni.
Not the answer.	Hayi impendulo.
Some people say.	Abanye abantu bathi .
I want to stop thinking about it.	Ndifuna ukuyeka ukucinga ngayo.
He also knew that he wanted to do that.	Wayesazi nokuba ufuna enjenjalo.
Finally he saw one thing clearly.	Ekugqibeleni wabona into enye ngokucacileyo.
And it all has to be true.	Kwaye konke kufuneka kube yinyani.
No one really thinks about it.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto ngokwenene.
He told me the other day.	Wandixelela ngenye imini.
Only he will.	Kuphela uya kwenza.
That will be difficult enough for you.	Oko kuya kuba nzima ngokwaneleyo kuwe.
It must have been very good to see.	Kumele ukuba kuhle kakhulu ukubona.
He sat down on the bed.	Wahlala phantsi ebhedini.
And it never did.	Kwaye zange ngexesha elinye.
Then, he realized.	Emva koko, waqonda.
It has to be done by a person.	Kufuneka yenziwe ngumntu.
No one told me that before.	Akukho mntu wandixelela oko ngaphambili.
I thought a lot.	Ndandicinga kakhulu.
But he is going the wrong way.	Kodwa uhamba ngendlela engalunganga.
You will go to your bed.	Uya kuhamba ebhedini yakho.
But there is a reason.	Kodwa kukho isizathu.
Here he thought.	Apha wacinga .
You already know how to do it.	Sele uyayazi indlela yokwenza.
I stay in his room all night.	Ndihlala egumbini lakhe ubusuku bonke.
Waiting for something.	Ukulinda nto.
Outside, no.	Ngaphandle, hayi.
Mom said.	Uye wathetha uMama.
Yes, it can be easier than you think.	Ewe, kunokuba lula kunokuba ucinga.
Or a little bit to me, of course.	Okanye kancinci kum, kunjalo.
It's really true.	Yinyani yinyani.
He just wanted to get out of the house.	Wayefuna nje ukuphuma endlini.
Yes, everything but one.	Ewe, yonke into kodwa enye.
Maybe you did not know.	Mhlawumbi ubungazi.
All right with you.	Kulungile nawe.
You feel bad.	Uziva kakubi.
That can only be good.	Oko kunokuba kuhle kuphela.
Well done that.	Yenziwe kakuhle loo nto.
Finally time is again.	Ekugqibeleni lixesha kwakhona.
Another woman, at the time.	Omnye umfazi, ngelo xesha.
I'm sure some people though.	Ndiqinisekile abanye abantu kodwa.
Probably nothing, though.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto, kodwa.
I want to come home.	Ndifuna ukuza ekhaya.
He wants to learn the truth.	Ufuna ukufunda inyaniso.
It is good to have just some of your time.	Kuhle ukuba ube nexesha lakho nje.
He did not drive.	Akazange aqhube.
Your place to do it, of course.	Indawo yakho yokwenza, kunjalo.
You do not have to wait for my permission.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ulinde imvume yam.
I mean completely and completely.	Ndithetha ngokupheleleyo kwaye ngokupheleleyo.
We will take your route.	Siza kuthatha indlela yakho.
Yes you are.	Ewe ukhona.
John, he knew.	UYohane, wayesazi.
You’ve done a lot with this thing before.	Wenze into enkulu ngale nto ngaphambili.
And it's time for my son to go to school.	Kwaye lixesha lokuba unyana wam aye esikolweni.
As it would be now.	Njengoko bekuya kuba njalo ngoku.
However, everyone is happy to have you.	Nokuba kunjalo, wonke umntu uyavuya ukuba nawe.
You know, of course.	Uyakwazi, kunjalo.
There is only death.	Kukho ukufa nje.
And the voice.	Kwaye ilizwi.
Now he thinks he will never succeed.	Ngoku ucinga ukuba soze aphumelele.
I speak really well.	Ndithetha kakuhle ngenene.
He does everything and He does everything well.	Wenza yonke into kwaye wenza yonke into kakuhle.
This time for sure.	Ngeli xesha ngokuqinisekileyo.
Another time maybe.	Elinye ixesha mhlawumbi.
Almost no one reads this job.	Phantse akukho mntu ufunda lo msebenzi.
I wish it was a better thing.	Ndinqwenela ukuba yinto engcono.
Now and always.	Ngoku kwaye rhoqo.
But it takes time to do that.	Kodwa kuthatha ixesha ukwenza oko.
A very unusual place.	Indawo enkulu engaqhelekanga.
It will be that easy.	Kuya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
However, you have a problem.	Kodwa ke, unengxaki.
I think soon.	Ndicinga kungekudala.
See if you are interested !.	Jonga ukuba unomdla!.
Clearly, he is very determined.	Ngokucacileyo, uzimisele kakhulu.
up in my house.	phezulu endlini yam.
That's too much.	Yinto eninzi kakhulu leyo.
I don't really like you.	Andikuthandi nyani.
I really like it.	Ndiyayithanda ngokuqinisekileyo.
He will also be tough.	Naye uya kuba nzima.
Not many, of course.	Akunjalo abaninzi, kunjalo.
You know it all, that.	Uyazi konke, loo nto.
You can't stay in it too much.	Awukwazi ukuhlala kuyo kakhulu.
It's been done before though.	Yenziwe loo nto ngaphambili nangona kunjalo.
That's fine with me.	Oko kulungile nam.
He doesn't like this place.	Akayithandi le ndawo.
He left late.	Uye wahamba emva kwexesha.
You eat alone.	Utya wedwa.
Maybe you read well.	Mhlawumbi ufunda kakuhle.
No, sooner or later.	Akunjalo, kungekudala okanye nantoni na.
We have gone too far.	Sihambe kakhulu.
And not bad.	Kwaye hayi kakubi.
So look again.	Ngoko jonga kwakhona.
I don't want it to be so true.	Andifuni ukuba yinyani kangako.
Almost very good.	Phantse kakuhle kakhulu.
I know where he is now.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uphi ngoku.
This should not happen, and it certainly does.	Oku akufanele ukuba kwenzeke, kwaye kunjalo.
I didn’t, really.	Andizange, ngokwenene.
In the morning no one is there.	Ekuseni umntu akakho.
But it is impossible to work in that situation.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukusebenza kuloo meko.
We all know who he is.	Sonke siyazi ukuba ngubani.
And all is well.	Kwaye konke kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
But it seems they did not.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi abazange.
And that he will never go.	Kwaye ukuba soze ahambe.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ayinguye.
It will happen in time.	Kuya kwenzeka ngexesha.
Or the opportunity for her to be able to stay home.	Okanye ithuba lokuba akwazi ukuhlala ekhaya.
But all of that seemed old-fashioned.	Kodwa konke oko kwakubonakala ngathi kudala.
It is good to be together.	Kuhle ukuhlala kunye.
But after that, he never had her.	Kodwa emva koko, akazange abe naye.
He did not want anyone to get in there.	Wayengafuni mntu ukuba angene apho.
And maybe in college, for that matter.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ekholejini, ngaloo nto.
He has taken his coffee.	Uye wathatha ikofu yakhe.
He said, at that moment.	Wathi, ngelo xesha.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Having friends.	Ukuba nabahlobo.
But he stayed with it.	Kodwa wahlala nayo.
Not so much on it.	Hayi kakhulu kuyo.
I hope to work more soon.	Ndiyathemba ukusebenza ngakumbi kungekudala.
No, more than you left.	Hayi, ngaphezu kokuba uhambe.
Thinking about it still, it seems like yesterday.	Ukucinga ngayo nangoku, kubonakala ngathi izolo.
Up in his bedroom.	Phezulu kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
Many but one.	Abaninzi kodwa omnye.
I just do my thing.	Ndenza nje into yam.
You know, like, yes.	Uyazi, njengokuba, ewe.
The passage of time.	Ukuhamba kwexesha.
You can never do that again.	Awunako ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
I went to our bedroom.	Ndaya egumbini lethu lokulala.
And look at him directly.	Kwaye ujonge kuye kanye.
It has to happen all the time.	Kufuneka kwenzeke ngalo lonke ixesha.
You can be me.	Unokuba ndim.
You will never be alone again.	Soze ube wedwa kwakhona.
If anyone.	Ukuba nabani na .
However, this is very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kunzima kakhulu.
You probably already know about this.	Mhlawumbi sele uyazi ngale nto.
Everyone wanted one.	Wonke umntu wayefuna enye.
And he did, yes.	Kwaye uyenzile, ewe.
I've had that for a long time.	Ndibe naloo nto ixesha elide.
I am happy to do that.	Ndiyavuya ukwenza oko.
I couldn’t do much.	Andikwazanga ukwenza okuninzi.
She understood my mother.	Waqonda umama.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngalonto.
For ease of reading.	Ukuze kube lula ukufunda.
To him, though.	Kuye, nangona kunjalo.
He gave me a picture.	Wandinika umfanekiso.
I think that's fine now.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile ngoku.
Very nice house.	Indlu entle kakhulu.
He wants to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba yedwa.
It is always there.	Kuhlala kukho.
There is a question.	Kukho umbuzo.
I wanted to think about it.	Ndandifuna ukucinga ngayo.
All of this is me.	Konke oku ndim.
But he made a mistake in this case.	Kodwa wenza impazamo kule meko.
I just want to do the right thing.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza into elungileyo.
And, you know very well.	Kwaye, ukwazi kakuhle kakhulu.
I don't see how.	Andiboni ukuba njani.
I don't want to be alone now.	Andifuni kuba ndedwa ngoku.
But he looked very bad.	Kodwa wayekhangeleka embi kakhulu.
Also, not much is done about it.	Kwakhona, akukho nto ingako yenziwe ngayo.
I think it is, absolutely.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo, ngokupheleleyo.
I knew he knew.	Ndandisazi naye ukuba uyayazi.
There is one more problem.	Kukho enye ingxaki enye.
At night he slept with me in my bed.	Ebusuku walala nam ebhedini yam.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Wonke umntu uthanda ukuphumelela.
Please sit down and wait a bit.	Nceda uhlale phantsi kwaye ulinde kancinci.
No voice, no phone, not a letter.	Hayi ilizwi, hayi umnxeba, hayi ileta.
So it's not over.	Ngoko ke akukho phezulu.
He would really do this.	Wayeza kuyenza ngokwenene le nto.
Yes, he ran to meet her.	Ewe, wabaleka waya kuye.
Nice place, nice place.	Indawo entle, indawo entle.
Me? ' 	Mna?'
Please do with it as you wish.	Nceda wenze ngayo njengoko unqwenela.
Talking about him.	Ukuthetha ngaye .
But it is possible that.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba.
I think that's good.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle oko.
We didn't really do much.	Asizange senze nto ingako ngokwenene.
My mother did not appear.	Umama akazange abonakale.
He was not angry with her.	Akazange abe nomsindo kuye.
Then he went back to his bed.	Emva koko wabuyela ebhedini yakhe.
But it really wasn't too hard.	Kodwa ngenene kwakungekho nzima kakhulu.
This is time consuming and difficult.	Oku kuthatha ixesha kwaye kunzima.
And as long as you want.	Kwaye ixesha elide njengoko ufuna.
Now it's time for me to go to work.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba ndiye emsebenzini.
Whatever he wants to do is right.	Nantoni na afuna ukuyenza ilungile.
He did not know.	Zange azi.
Everything is male.	Yonke into yindoda.
I learned from everything.	Ndifunde kuyo yonke into.
It looks like a party.	Kubonakala ngathi itheko apho.
So the question remains.	Ngoko umbuzo uhlala uhleli.
There was no need for him to agree.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba avume.
Or you.	Okanye nawe.
And he is sleeping.	Kwaye ulele.
The doctor needs more time.	Ugqirha ufuna ixesha elingakumbi.
This may happen more often than you think.	Oku kunokwenzeka rhoqo kunokuba ucinga.
it's not me.	ayindim.
We have made a lot of money.	Senze imali eninzi kakhulu.
Look in my bedroom.	Jonga kwigumbi lam lokulala.
If you can be there.	Ukuba unokuba khona.
I'm just here.	Ndilapha nje.
I stay a little longer.	Ndihlala mde kancinci.
But it is impossible to say that.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuthetha oko.
Thank you for making the food delicious.	Enkosi ngokwenza ukutya kube mnandi.
I wanted to talk all night.	Ndandifuna ukuthetha ubusuku bonke.
I love what he did.	Ndiyayithanda lento ayenzileyo.
There is always something to be done.	Kuhlala kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe.
Sure, though.	Uqinisekile, nangona kunjalo.
Well maybe not exactly.	Kulungile mhlawumbi hayi ncam.
But everyone saw it.	Kodwa wonke umntu wabona.
Soon something completely different.	Kungekudala enye into ngokupheleleyo.
It may be a good thing, but it is a good thing.	Inokuba yinto entle, kodwa yinto entle.
You want something too.	Nawe ufuna into.
Or it can be as difficult as you like.	Okanye inokuba nzima njengoko uthanda.
You know.	Waziva .
You will have time.	Uya kuba nexesha.
And then a little bit.	Kwaye ke encinci.
And again, he knew it could be difficult with it.	Kwaye kwakhona, wayesazi ukuba inokuba nzima nayo.
I said nothing to myself.	Khange ndithethe nto kum.
Let me say something about that.	Makhe ndithethe into ngaloo nto.
If you say yes, that's fine with you.	Ukuba uthe ewe, kulungile kuwe.
It will be a long, long time.	Kuya kuba ixesha elide, kakhulu.
Your message should be interesting.	Umyalezo wakho kufuneka ube mnandi.
But this is clearly happening, too.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngokucacileyo, kwakhona.
Not too much to make a decision.	Akukho kakhulu ukwenza isigqibo.
My father is a doctor.	Utata ngugqirha.
Not like a big deal.	Hayi ngathi yinto enkulu.
I'll do it this afternoon.	Ndiza kuyenza ngale njikalanga.
All the time, just about anything, just about everything.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, malunga nantoni na, malunga nayo yonke into.
It was clear to everyone.	Kwakucacile kuye wonke umntu.
Dad does it all the time.	Utata uyenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
Everyone is looking at me.	Wonke umntu ujonge kum.
Do not overreact.	Musa ukuba nomsindo kangako.
He should have stayed with me.	Bekufanele ahlale nam.
I look forward to meeting you there.	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana nawe apho.
Not if you drive anyway.	Hayi xa uqhuba kunjalo.
I know, really.	Ndiyakwazi, ngokwenene.
He ran away.	Wabaleka kakhulu.
Thanks for making it easy.	Enkosi ngokwenza kube lula.
This is about.	Oku kuthetha malunga.
Then again.	Emva koko kwaye.
I thought you should know.	Ndacinga ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
I want to know more about it.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngayo.
I'm sorry you feel that way.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba uziva ngolo hlobo.
I'm not sure how you do that you live.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyenza njani loo nto uhlala.
He immediately saw what it would be like.	Ngoko nangoko wabona ukuba kuya kuba njani.
My dad, for sure.	Utata wam, ngokuqinisekileyo.
We would not get anywhere without him.	Asiyi kufika ndawo ngaphandle kwakhe.
I wanted to be outside.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngaphandle.
Or why he wants to.	Okanye kutheni efuna.
So, go here.	Ngoko, iya apha.
She was scared, though.	Wayesoyika, nangona kunjalo.
Then he took a picture.	Emva koko wathatha umfanekiso.
We go there a lot.	Siya apho kakhulu.
There is no reason for you to sit down.	Akukho sizathu sokuba uhlale phantsi.
He likes to talk.	Uyathanda ukuthetha.
Not anytime soon.	Hayi nanini na kungekudala.
But not so often.	Kodwa hayi ngolo hlobo kwaye rhoqo.
You have everything wrong.	Unayo yonke into engalunganga.
This can be anything.	Oku kunokuba nantoni na.
Thanks again for lunch.	Enkosi kwakhona ngesidlo sasemini.
Don't forget now.	Ungalibali ngoku.
I said nothing.	Zange ndithethe nto.
Saying nothing about money.	Ukuthetha nto ngemali.
He would do this.	Wayeza kuyenza le nto.
Yes, learning is hard.	Ewe, ukufunda kunzima.
He knew about it for weeks.	Wayesazi ngayo iiveki.
Not with us, but with just me.	Hayi kunye nathi, kodwa kunye nam nje.
He did not know what he wanted.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ntoni.
And he is not high.	Kwaye akakho phezulu.
No problem with us.	Akukho ngxaki nathi.
It's good to be there.	Kuhle ukuba lapho.
No, you have to go with me.	Hayi, kufuneka uhambe nam.
I wanted an answer.	Bendifuna impendulo.
You did a good thing.	Wenze into entle.
It takes time, a lot of time.	Kuthatha ixesha, ixesha elininzi.
Nobody ever did that.	Akukho mntu wakha wakwenza oko.
Please, that would be nice.	Nceda, oko bekuya kuba kuhle.
You need to get to him quickly.	Kufuneka ufike kuye ngokukhawuleza.
It’s hard, though.	Kunzima, nangona kunjalo.
Come to us.	Uze kuthi.
If only he knew how bad it was.	Ukuba nje wayesazi ukuba kakubi kangakanani.
But we know one thing.	Kodwa siyazi into enye.
And soon he knew.	Kwaye kungekudala wayesazi.
Why is that.	Kutheni kunjalo.
But you came too late.	Kodwa ufike emva kwexesha kakhulu.
I said you want to.	Ndithethe ukuba uyafuna.
He said he wanted his mother.	Wathi ufuna umama wakhe.
Not until this week.	Hayi kude kube yile veki.
Again, good to know.	Kwakhona, kuhle ukwazi.
Someone will start something new tomorrow.	Umntu uza kuqala into entsha ngomso.
At that time, this will be the case.	Ngelo xesha, oku kuya kuba njalo.
And no problem for sure.	Kwaye akukho ngxaki ngokuqinisekileyo.
The question can be very difficult.	Umbuzo unokuba nzima ngokwenene.
Not with the kids.	Hayi nabantwana.
Would you like some?	Ngaba ungathanda ezinye?
My son is curious.	Unyana wam unomdla.
But, please, look.	Kodwa, nceda, jonga.
I thought you were right.	Bendicinga ukuba ulungile.
And you have to look that way.	Kwaye kufuneka ujonge ngaloo ndlela.
And coffee, of course.	Kwaye ikofu, kunjalo.
If not, you could be a good player.	Ukuba akunjalo, usenokuba ngumdlali olungileyo.
Is there a room there.	Ngaba kukho igumbi apho.
We know that he did not do that.	Siyazi ukuba akazange ayenze loo nto.
Yes, it is not, and no it is not.	Ewe, akunjalo, kwaye hayi akunjalo.
And he talked to everyone.	Kwaye wathetha naye wonke umntu.
He would do as he pleased.	Wayeza kwenza njengoko efuna.
Soon he will come to the house.	Kungekudala uza kuza endlwini.
Is it someone else ?.	Ngaba omnye umntu?.
He went to college and got a job.	Waya ekholejini waza wenza umsebenzi.
That's it, that's everything.	Yiloo nto, yiyo yonke into.
We will get a house.	Siza kufumana indlu.
Besides, he wanted to go.	Ngaphandle koko, wayefuna ukuhamba.
I want to work on that.	Ndifuna ukusebenza kuloo nto.
This task can be very difficult.	Lo msebenzi unokuba nzima kakhulu.
It does so in the beginning.	Kwenza njalo ekuqaleni.
Not his mind.	Hayi ingqondo yakhe.
Nothing, you know.	Akukho nto, uyazi.
We need to do the same.	Kufuneka senze into efanayo.
It's hard, but you are there.	Kunzima, kodwa ukhona.
I have to stay here, in this place.	Ndifanele ukuhlala apha, kule ndawo.
But he did not come to the party.	Kodwa akazange eze epatini.
My wife is not here.	Umfazi wam akakho.
But the case.	Kodwa ityala.
You better think about this.	Kungcono ucinge ngale nto.
My father wanted to buy.	Utata wayefuna ukuthenga.
He said no, he said yes.	Wathi hayi, wathi ewe.
But he says this.	Kodwa uthetha oku.
He has to do something.	Kufuneka enze into.
What do you think? 	Ingaba ucinga ntoni?
He just wants to play football.	Ufuna nje ukudlala ibhola.
He does not know why we should go there.	Akayazi ukuba kutheni kufuneka siye apho.
Please just finish this.	Nceda nje ukugqiba oku.
Death will be wonderful.	Ukufa kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
That's me.	Ndim lowo kodwa.
He can't pretend nothing happened.	Akakwazi ukwenza ngathi akukho nto yenzekileyo.
He did that to her.	Wenza loo nto kuye.
Not everything, of course.	Hayi yonke into, kunjalo.
He went in alone.	Wangena eyedwa.
Or is it made.	Okanye ngaba yenziwe.
I wish it were but it is not.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo kodwa akunjalo.
Some really, really bad.	Abanye ngokwenene, embi kakhulu.
Just me.	Mna kuphela.
Then he decided to tell the truth.	Emva koko wagqiba kwelokuba athethe inyani.
Maybe he will talk to you.	Mhlawumbi uya kuthetha nawe.
He would have to do so.	Bekuya kufuneka enze njalo.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nayo.
Well, not really.	Kulungile, akunjalo ngokwenene.
No time, no time, no time.	Akukho xesha, akukho xesha, akukho xesha.
They will say this.	Baya kuthetha oku.
I've been a thing, a thing.	Ndibe yinto, into.
I love that though.	Ndiyayithanda loo nto nangona.
One truth, or almost a certain truth.	Inyani enye, okanye phantse inyani ethile.
He said that would be easy.	Wathi oko kuya kuba lula.
I thought about it more.	Ndacinga ngayo ngakumbi.
I will take anyone to my bed.	Ndiza kuthatha nabani na ebhedini yam.
What would he do?	Wayeza kwenza ntoni na.
I do all the thinking here.	Ndenza konke ukucinga apha.
He did everything well.	Wenza konke kakuhle.
In the park.	Epakini.
I don't think it will last very long.	Andiqondi ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elide kakhulu.
But there seems to be a problem.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kukho ingxaki.
We will be there for a week.	Siza kuba khona iveki.
Immediate response.	Impendulo kwangoko.
And finally, yes.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, ewe.
The question is what should we do about it.	Umbuzo kukuba kufuneka senze ntoni ngale nto.
Don’t take it too seriously, though.	Musa ukuthatha kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
He never got into it.	Akazange angene kuyo.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.	Ewe, ewe, nantoni na.
I should not have done that.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ndiyenze loo nto.
It's good to be here.	Kulungile ukuba ukhona.
You can't be sad.	Awukwazi ukuba buhlungu.
Again, that is exactly what happened.	Kwakhona, kwenzeka kanye loo nto.
He likes to think about it.	Uyathanda ukucinga ngayo.
You may be here.	Usenokuba ulapha.
And so, and so, and so forth.	Kwaye njalo, kwaye njalo, njalo njalo.
There are many more.	Kukho ezinye ezininzi.
And now, this.	Kwaye ngoku, oku.
Now that would be strange.	Ngoku oko kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Then, something else will appear.	Emva koko, enye into iya kubonakala.
He never talked about it.	Akazange athethe ngayo.
I don't think this will really work.	Andiqondi ukuba oku kuya kwenza ngokwenene.
They will do it, the police.	Baya kuyenza loo nto, amapolisa.
We know he did.	Siyazi ukuba wenza njalo.
Lots of debt.	Ityala elininzi.
All right, everyone.	Kulungile, wonke umntu.
But that was not the case with him.	Kodwa akuzange kube njalo kuye.
And all is not possible, you think.	Kwaye konke akunakwenzeka, ucinga.
Clearly, he is.	Ngokucacileyo, unjalo.
You work hard at it.	Usebenza nzima kuloo nto.
And I, for my part, shall be down.	Mna ke, ndiya kuba phantsi.
You know, just to help.	Uyazi, ukunceda nje.
He knew he would never be the same again.	Wayesazi ukuba soze aphinde abe nguye.
He didn't look very good, though.	Wayengabonakali kakuhle, nangona kunjalo.
It never really happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene.
I feel confident here.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile apha.
I'll go to the office first.	Ndiza kuqala ndiye eofisini.
Yes, he lived there.	Ewe, wayehlala apho.
Now is the time for us to leave.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba sihambe.
Something went wrong.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo ngokucacileyo.
But, enough.	Kodwa, ngokwaneleyo.
I hope to stay there all my days.	Ndiyathemba ukuhlala apho yonke imihla yam.
You better do something about it, he thought.	Kungcono wenze into malunga naloo nto, wacinga.
I want your answer to this.	Ndifuna impendulo yakho kule nto.
And suddenly you feel a few things.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza uziva izinto ezimbalwa.
Being alone is very difficult.	Ukuba wedwa kunzima kakhulu.
He certainly got a lot of attention.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wafumana ingqalelo eninzi.
I'm not sure what you did with this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze ntoni ngale nto.
I can't wait to get another one !.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufumana enye!.
There seems to be something wrong here.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into embi apha.
I wanted to know everything right away, every day.	Ndandifuna ukwazi yonke into ngoko nangoko, yonke imihla.
And that wait can be very far away.	Kwaye oko kulinda kunokuba kude kakhulu.
There is one small mistake.	Kukho impazamo enye encinci.
And now all this.	Kwaye ngoku konke oku.
It will only last two weeks.	Uya kuhlala nje iiveki ezimbini.
And finally he did.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni uyenzile.
Not this, though.	Hayi le, nangona kunjalo.
I will be up there for sure.	Ndiya kuba phaya phezulu ngokuqinisekileyo.
Nobody there.	Akukho mntu phaya.
Sorry but not for me.	Uxolo kodwa hayi kum.
We will talk more about that later.	Siza kuthetha ngakumbi ngoko.
I will do that, too.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto, nam.
Clearly or explicitly.	Ngokucacileyo okanye ngokucacileyo.
He took it very seriously.	Wathatha kakhulu.
His case.	Ityala lakhe.
But this time it is not.	Kodwa ngeli xesha akunjalo.
And then he understood more clearly.	Kwaye ke waqonda ngokucacileyo ngakumbi.
I didn't see anything.	Andizange ndibone nantoni na.
That's all this.	Yiloo nto yonke le nto.
You will find food.	Uya kufumana ukutya.
But all of this is very difficult.	Kodwa konke oku kunzima kakhulu.
I can say the word.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha igama.
We did it on time.	Senze kwangethuba.
They sat down on the side.	Baye bahlala phantsi ecaleni.
So look at it.	Ngoko jonga kuyo.
Not in my place.	Hayi kwindawo yam.
For now, thank you.	Okwangoku, enkosi.
He will not stay long.	Akayi kuhlala ixesha elide.
What is wrong with me?.	Yintoni engalunganga ngam?.
My first job.	Umsebenzi wam wokuqala.
It's just an old thing.	Yinto endala nje.
She doesn't even know if you love him.	Akakwazi nokuba uyamthanda na.
It seemed like a small thing.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto encinci.
You're right about it.	Ulungile ngayo.
Because he is a good man.	Kuba ungumntu olungileyo.
He entered the room, went to her.	Wangena egumbini, waya kuye.
I know this is difficult, especially today.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kunzima, ngakumbi namhlanje.
There is someone there.	Kukho umntu phaya.
Good to meet you.	Kulungile ukudibana nawe.
Very little permission.	Imvume encinci kakhulu.
I know the car.	Ndiyayazi imoto.
I'm not sure how it could have been better.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba inokuba ngcono njani.
That's what happened this morning.	Nantso into eyenzekileyo ngale ntsasa.
Clearly, he is intelligent.	Kucacile ukuba ukrelekrele.
Not tomorrow, today.	Hayi ngomso, namhlanje.
He certainly did not want to go to prison.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengafuni ukuya entolongweni.
It always happens back home.	Kwenzeka njalo emva ekhaya.
And not for me.	Kwaye hayi kum.
But he certainly did not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akazange enjenjalo.
He never spoke again.	Khange aphinde athethe.
And this is not easy.	Kwaye oku akukho lula.
No side view.	Akukho jonga ecaleni.
However, you do not have to look very closely.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho mfuneko yokuba ujonge kakhulu.
He can never say that.	Akanakuze athethe oko.
But he didn't want his mother to know.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba umama wakhe azi.
He did not really need help.	Akazange afune uncedo ngokwenene.
So it is with me.	Kunjalo kum.
He tried to decide what to do.	Wazama ukwenza isigqibo sokuba enze ntoni.
I want to know why.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni kunjalo.
They'll just do it.	Baza kuyenza nje.
There was no one but me.	Kwakungekho mntu ngaphandle kwam.
He does not know what he wants.	Akayazi into ayifunayo.
You never know what someone might do.	Awukwazi ukuba umntu uyakwazi ukwenza ntoni.
That's your person.	Ngumntu wakho lowo.
And then he went on.	Waza ke waqhubeka.
I am at this time.	Ndim ngeli xesha.
I never thought about this question much.	Andizange ndicinge ngalo mbuzo kakhulu.
Then you think better of it.	Emva koko ucinga ngcono ngayo.
I thought about it all day.	Bendicinga ngayo imini yonke.
Well, my bad.	Kulungile, embi yam.
But today there is nothing about that.	Kodwa namhlanje akukho malunga naloo nto.
He's been here a long time.	Unexesha elide elapha.
A few days, a week too.	Iintsuku ezimbalwa, iveki kakhulu.
Here in his house.	Apha endlini yakhe.
He told me a week.	Wandixelela iveki.
I think everyone will do it.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uya kuyenza.
Lunch at local.	Isidlo sasemini kwindawo.
And yes.	Kwaye ewe .
Impossible and not necessary.	Akunakwenzeka kwaye akuyomfuneko.
No one asked the question.	Akukho mntu wabuza umbuzo.
But it will not be.	Kodwa akuyi kuba njalo.
Look forward to it.	Jonga phambili kuyo.
You do not have to apologize.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthi uxolo.
He did it once.	Wenze kanye.
Sorry but still.	Uxolo kodwa kunjalo.
A big, cute cat.	Ikati enkulu, entle entle.
And before that, the cat.	Kwaye ngaphambi koko, ikati.
We did it tomorrow.	Senze njalo kusasa.
You must be going to work.	Kumele ukuba uya emsebenzini.
That's one little thing to do.	Yinto enye encinci ukuyenza.
And you don't have to have it.	Kwaye akufuneki ube nayo.
No, it can be fun.	Hayi, kunokuba mnandi.
We will wait two, maybe three days.	Siya kulinda ezimbini, mhlawumbi iintsuku ezintathu.
But he only wanted to go to his place of residence.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuya kwindawo yakhe yokuhlala kuphela.
All of this is done at once.	Yonke le nto yenziwe ngexesha elinye.
I always try to do something every day.	Ndihlala ndizama ukwenza into yonke imihla.
Man, you're fine.	Mntu, ulungile.
Every day my son wants to go to school.	Yonke imihla unyana wam ufuna ukuya esikolweni.
Or death.	Okanye ukufa.
There was nothing out there.	Kwakungekho nto ngaphandle.
If you can do that.	Ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
It's over now.	Kwaphela ngoku.
He will do this.	Uya kuyenza le nto.
I really like that one.	Ndiyayithanda ngokwenene leyo.
I never thought you could do it.	Khange ndicinge ukuba ungayenza.
No one knows you have never done it before.	Akukho mntu uyazi ukuba awuzange uyenze ngaphambili.
All of that will happen soon.	Konke oko kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
He never did, though.	Akazange enjenjalo, nangona kunjalo.
I have no other place.	Andinayo enye indawo.
I do not want her to leave.	Andifuni ukuba ayeke ahambe.
I'm sorry, I have to go now.	Uxolo, kufuneka ndihambe.
But they say that it is all right.	Kodwa bathi oko kulungile.
He has become a great friend.	Uye waba ngumhlobo omkhulu.
He did so here.	Wenza njalo apha.
So it is not easy.	Ngoko akukho lula.
No one was supposed to be there at night.	Kwakungekho mntu ufanele ukuba abe apho ebusuku.
If necessary, it should.	Ukuba kufuneka, kufuneka.
We will do this again.	Siza kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
They will be angry.	Baya kuba nomsindo.
Very probably.	Kakhulu mhlawumbi.
Just as he knew it would be so.	Kanye njengoko wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He will be looking for one but.	Uya kuba efuna enye kodwa.
He did not speak however.	Akazange athethe nangona kunjalo.
But you can't stop eating.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuyeka ukutya.
I have to do something about it.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngaloo nto.
Lots of stuff, maybe.	Izinto ezininzi, mhlawumbi.
I want him to agree.	Ndifuna ukuba avume.
It may be soon.	Inokuba kungekudala.
He wanted to know that.	Wayefuna ukwazi oko.
I thought that.	Bendicinga lonto.
Today there is none.	Namhlanje akukho .
I don't see a way about that yet.	Andiboni ndlela malunga naloo nto okwangoku.
That is my plan.	Licebo lam elo.
He thought it was well done.	Wayecinga ukuba yenziwe kakuhle.
There is some truth in it.	Kukho inyaniso ethile kuyo.
This time he spoke to me.	Ngeli xesha wathetha nam.
I'm not saying you should know that.	Andithi kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
That's what he always does.	Yiloo nto ahlala esenza ngayo.
I will buy more, less.	Ndiza kuthenga ngakumbi, kancinci.
But no one thought about work.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayecinga ngomsebenzi.
Not a bit, now.	Hayi kancinci, ngoku.
I want to hurry.	Ndifuna ngokukhawuleza.
I would like to read his books.	Ndingathanda ukufunda iincwadi zakhe.
And again completely.	Kwaye kwakhona ngokupheleleyo.
You will need to know what to do with it.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ukuba wenze ntoni ngayo.
Bad little ball.	Ibhola encinci embi.
Really everything.	Ngokwenene yonke into.
He wants the truth, he thought.	Ufuna inyaniso, wacinga njalo.
It's all the time.	Lixesha lonke.
And, yes you made a mistake.	Kwaye, ewe wenze impazamo.
This was not the case.	Oku kwakungekho.
This means everything.	Oku kuthetha konke.
You have to go fast, though.	Kufuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza, nangona kunjalo.
Tell me where I have gone.	Ndixelele ukuba ndiye phi.
Although difficult, this work is completely committed.	Nangona kunzima, lo msebenzi uzimisele ngokupheleleyo.
I could not go home.	Khange ndikwazi ukuya ekhaya.
Now one.	Ngoku enye.
I am looking for a place.	Ndifuna indawo.
Because you will not be able to do it any other way.	Ngenxa yokuba awuyi kukwazi ukwenza ngenye indlela.
Is that true ?.	Ngaba yinyani leyo?.
But there was no question about that now.	Kodwa kwakungekho mbuzo ngaloo nto ngoku.
He thought he would never know.	Wayecinga ukuba akanakuze azi.
And go fast.	Kwaye uhambe ngokukhawuleza.
If so, it will not last long.	Ukuba kunjalo, akayi kuba ixesha elide.
I hope not, though.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
A little attention, but not too much.	Ingqalelo encinci, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
You never have a problem.	Akukho xesha unengxaki.
He is going the wrong way.	Uhamba ngendlela engalunganga.
But the big answer.	Kodwa impendulo enkulu.
I think you should be there.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube lapho.
And he never went with it.	Kwaye akazange ahambe nayo.
He works here so he needs to know what is right.	Usebenza apha ngoko kufuneka azi ukuba yintoni elungileyo.
I'm so sorry, but I am.	Uxolo kakhulu, kodwa ndim.
He went down a little.	Wehla kancinci.
And you can sing.	Kwaye uyakwazi ukucula.
I do that all the time.	Ndiyenza loo nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
Look at one, and one.	Jonga enye, kwaye enye.
Every time he is here.	Ngalo lonke ixesha elapha.
And not just anyone.	Kwaye hayi nje nabani na.
I would like you to go with me.	Ndingathanda ukuba uhambe nam.
Very, very lucky.	Kakhulu, unethamsanqa kakhulu.
He tried hard to control himself.	Wazama ngamandla ukuzibamba.
Just another one then.	Nje enye ke.
No one knows better than I do.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngcono kunam.
Yeah, about that.	Ewe, malunga naloo nto.
I live far from it.	Ndihlala kude kuyo.
He wanted her to commit a crime.	Wayefuna ukuba enze ityala.
As we shall see.	Njengoko siza kubona.
This is your first child.	Ngumntwana wakho wokuqala lo.
Playing again is always good.	Ukudlala kwakhona kuhlala kulungile.
I feel like.	Ndiziva ngathi .
I know almost nothing about it.	Andazi phantse kwanto ngayo.
Obviously, it is.	Ngokucacileyo, kunjalo.
That's the way he always talks.	Yiloo ndlela ahlala ethetha ngayo.
He ran away, too.	Wabaleka, naye.
You won't get any money, but you can't have everything.	Awuyi kufumana nayiphi na imali, kodwa awukwazi ukuba nayo yonke into.
Yes, we do.	Ewe, nathi.
So there it is.	Ngoko ke apho.
You go to town.	Uya edolophini.
However, I do not know how I did it.	Nangona kunjalo, andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
He came down.	Wehla .
Glad to see how it goes.	Ndiyavuya ukubona ukuba kuhamba njani.
Finding the problem.	Ukufumana ingxaki.
Just his car.	Imoto yakhe nje.
Let me think about all of that.	Makhe ndicinge ngayo yonke loo nto.
But this is just me.	Kodwa oku ndim kuphela.
He wanted, all the time.	Wayefuna, lonke ixesha.
I wanted a week to think.	Ndandifuna iveki ukucinga.
Her father, it is possible.	Utata wakhe, kunokwenzeka.
Someone did.	Omnye wenza njalo.
Nobody stays there long.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho ixesha elide.
And she is a child.	Kwaye ngumntwana.
Maybe not always, but often enough.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa rhoqo ngokwaneleyo.
Then he opened the door.	Emva koko wavula ucango.
Then he finished.	Emva koko wagqiba.
Or if not.	Okanye ukuba akunjalo.
And it is not only in the end, but every day.	Kwaye ayisiyiyo kuphela ekugqibeleni, kodwa yonke imihla.
I love this place, too.	Ndiyayithanda le ndawo, nam.
Or say anything.	Okanye uthethe nantoni na.
Because he is just like you.	Kuba ufana nawe.
Good to read.	Kuhle ukufunda.
Also other things.	Kwakhona ezinye izinto.
So we want more.	Ngoko sifuna ngakumbi.
He found a place to stay.	Wafumana indawo yokuhlala.
So there really is no reason.	Ngoko ngokwenene akukho sizathu.
We'll see after we do.	Siza kubona emva kokuba senze.
He is the problem.	Nguye ingxaki.
Good music will do just that.	Umculo lo ulungile uya kwenza oko.
A little bit though.	Kancinci kancinci kodwa.
I wanted a good one.	Ndandifuna elungileyo.
Probably not beautiful.	Mhlawumbi hayi entle.
It's hard to read, of course.	Kunzima ukufunda, kunjalo.
But long enough.	Kodwa ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
He speaks the whole way.	Uthetha indlela yonke.
Tell me what you think.	Ndixelele ukuba ucinge.
We'll talk about you.	Siza kuthetha ngawe.
There is another problem though.	Kukho enye ingxaki nangona kunjalo.
Well, this is what he did to me.	Kulungile, yile nto ayenzileyo kum.
But then it was not fun.	Kodwa emva koko akuzange kube mnandi.
I really could not.	Ngenene andizange ndikwazi.
And they will say something.	Kwaye baya kuthetha into.
So really, whatever.	Ngoko ngokwenene, nokuba yeyiphi.
No one really knows how much.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene ukuba kangakanani.
I just want to be with him all the time.	Ndifuna nje ukuba naye ngalo lonke ixesha.
Well done, you and me.	Senze kakuhle, wena kunye nam.
He told me what happened there.	Wandixelela into eyenzekayo apho.
Thanks, for everything really.	Enkosi, ngayo yonke into ngokwenene.
But food, or food, is fine.	Kodwa ukutya, okanye ukutya, kulungile.
No one talked to her like that, no one.	Akukho mntu wathetha naye ngolo hlobo, akukho namnye.
He knew, then.	Wayesazi, ngoko.
Everyone will make their own story.	Wonke umntu uya kwenza ibali lakhe.
Because you want to know.	Kuba ufuna ukwazi.
This is exactly what happened.	Yile nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Ndijonge phambili kuyo kakhulu.
Many, many more people.	Abaninzi, abantu abaninzi ngakumbi.
But that is not possible, he concluded.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka, wagqiba.
But there must be a problem.	Kodwa kumele ukuba kukho ingxaki.
I know, and we know, the right thing to do.	Ndiyazi, kwaye siyazi, into elungileyo yokwenza.
But in the end it is so.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kunjalo.
How do I do this ?.	Ndiyenza njani lento?.
Or me with that.	Okanye mna ngaloo nto.
No one has ever suggested anything to you.	Akukho mntu uye wacebisa nantoni na kuwe.
But it has not been good enough.	Kodwa akuzange kube kuhle ngokwaneleyo.
They stay late.	Bahlala mva.
But enough, already.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo, sele.
It is not 'really difficult.	Akukho 'kunzima ngokwenene.
You will definitely be here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba lapha.
I never really had it.	Andizange ndibe nayo ngokwenene.
Nobody knew about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngayo.
They stay overnight.	Bahlala ebusuku.
I would like some assistance.	Ndingathanda ukufumana uncedo.
It will not be easy.	Asiyi kuba lula.
He lived with her a lot.	Wayehlala naye kakhulu.
Clearly.	Kucacile ukuba .
You will not sit down.	Awuyi kuhlala phantsi.
It will be something new.	Iya kuba yinto entsha.
We will talk about this later.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto kamva.
I would like to stop talking.	Ndingathanda ukuyeka ukuthetha.
Not inside, but outside, all day.	Hayi ngaphakathi, kodwa ngaphandle, imini yonke.
I could not stop thinking about you.	Khange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngawe.
I do a little bit.	Ndenza kancinci.
If he comes back soon, you know.	Ukuba uza kubuya kungekudala, uyazi.
Not immediately after.	Hayi ngoko nangoko emva.
But maybe this is too hard.	Kodwa mhlawumbi oku kunzima kakhulu.
The problem within him.	Ingxaki ngaphakathi kuye.
Anything, really.	Nantoni na, ngokwenene.
There is no movement.	Akukho kuhamba.
So can you.	Ngoko ke, nawe unokuba njalo.
I want to help in any way I can.	Ndifuna ukunceda ngayo nayiphi na indlela.
Now finding a way inside, he thought.	Ngoku ukufumana indlela ngaphakathi, wacinga.
And the problem goes backwards.	Kwaye ingxaki iya ngasemva.
Buying a car.	Ukuthenga imoto.
Yes it is difficult, but it is not possible.	Ewe kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He felt absent.	Waziva engekho.
Well, you can't.	Ewe, awukwazi.
He can't know.	Akakwazi ukwazi.
And he began to speak.	Waqalisa ke ukuthetha.
And he knew something was wrong last night.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga phezolo.
Talking about it.	Ethetha ngayo .
But you do not want to tell him the truth.	Kodwa awufuni kumxelela inyani.
This morning something very unusual happened.	Ngale ntsasa kwenzeke into engaqhelekanga.
So you don't want to talk.	Ngoko awufuni kuthetha.
I can't stop eating.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukutya.
Your case.	Ityala lakho.
I love it now.	Ndiyayithanda ngoku.
I have to go here.	Kufuneka ndihambe apha.
And so it is with everything else.	Kwaye kunjalo kuyo yonke enye into.
I know nothing about it.	Andazi kwanto ngayo.
There is no waiting at all.	Akukho kulinda kwaphela.
He sat down there.	Wahlala phantsi apho.
So, look at someone else.	Ngoko ke, jonga omnye umntu.
And he wanted to know.	Kwaye wayefuna ukwazi.
I will never see him again.	Soze ndiphinde ndimbone.
It can be a child all the time.	Inokuba ngumntwana rhoqo.
If you have it.	Ukuba unayo .
Or, it could be tomorrow.	Okanye, inokuba ngomso.
And so you said.	Kwaye ke nawe uthe.
He wanted to learn everything.	Wayefuna ukufunda konke.
And by being there.	Kwaye ngokuba khona.
It would be great then.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu ngoko.
This will take time to deal with.	Oku kuya kuthatha ixesha ukudibana nayo.
You want more people.	Ufuna abantu ngakumbi.
See what happened today.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni namhlanje.
He did not succeed at all.	Akazange aphumelele kwaphela.
We have to do it !!.	Kufuneka siyenze!!.
So it could be true.	Ngoko ke inokuba yinyani.
Maybe more today.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi namhlanje.
I do not clearly remember.	Andikhumbuli ngokucacileyo.
I'm glad it is.	Ndiyavuya ukuba kunjalo.
But he just wanted to talk.	Kodwa wayefuna nje ukuthetha.
Controversy, guards.	Utata, wacinga.
Nothing, though.	Akukho nto, nangona kunjalo.
He also knew how.	Naye wayesazi ukuba njani.
Something very unusual is happening here.	Kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga apha.
Something a little bigger.	Into encinci enkulu.
Who and why.	Ngubani njengokuba kutheni.
And now that's it.	Kwaye ngoku yiloo nto.
I'm just happy to go there.	Ndiyavuya nje ukuya khona.
I decided to ask for help.	Ndiye ndagqiba ndicela uncedo.
And, of course, the eyes.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, amehlo.
We have never been to such a beautiful place.	Zange siye kwindawo entle ngolu hlobo.
And so, that's all we need to know.	Kwaye ke, yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka siyazi ngayo.
However, it takes time.	Nangona kunjalo, kufuna ixesha.
And then, there it is.	Kwaye ke, nantso ke.
Not outside, or inside.	Akukho ngaphandle, okanye ngaphakathi.
And then he was not alone.	Kwaye ke wayengekho yedwa.
Do not tell others.	Musa ukuxelela abanye.
Here we will do just that.	Apha siya kwenza kanye loo nto.
You will need to think about it first.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngayo kuqala.
My son speaks well.	Unyana wam uthetha kakuhle.
I can't imagine how you do it.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba uyenza njani.
For it is good at this time.	Kuba kuhle ngeli xesha.
I can be alone.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba ndedwa.
That's a really big thing.	Yinto enkulu ngokwenene leyo.
To be sad for you.	Ukuba buhlungu kuwe.
Look at this.	Jonga oku .
This is hard enough.	Oku kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
He manages his money.	Uqhuba imali yakhe.
And dad, of course.	Kwaye utata, kunjalo.
We both need to have it.	Sobabini kufuneka sibe nayo.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba wenze njani.
But certainly for me.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo ngam.
He knew he needed to eat now.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka atye ngoku.
They will find a way.	Baya kufumana indlela.
He came to talk to me.	Weza kuthetha nam.
If something happens to me.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
I've done all that.	Ndiyenzile yonke loo nto.
But no, it seems, for money.	Kodwa akunjalo, kubonakala ngathi, ngemali.
It was nothing then, of course.	Kwakungekho nto ke ngoko, kunjalo.
And it is certainly true.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani.
I am absolutely.	Ndim ngokupheleleyo.
You almost arrived now.	Uphantse wafika ngoku.
It can be very simple.	Inokuba lula kakhulu.
He is busy though.	Uxakekile kunjalo.
There is another job for you.	Kukho omnye umsebenzi wakho.
And no one likes anyone.	Kwaye akukho mntu uthanda nabani na.
Maybe we'll go there for dinner tonight.	Mhlawumbi siza kuya apho ngesidlo sangokuhlwa namhlanje.
He used to do the same thing in college.	Wayedla ngokwenza into efanayo ekholejini.
You know, a little bit like this.	Uyazi, kancinci ngolu hlobo.
Yes, it is a long time.	Ewe, lixesha elide.
That will take time, though.	Oko kuya kuthatha ixesha, nangona kunjalo.
It is good to go with him.	Kuhle ukuhamba naye.
You did well last night.	Uyenze kakuhle phezolo.
He opened the door again.	Wavula ucango kwakhona.
Not too much to see here.	Akukho kakhulu ukubona apha.
No one at all.	Akukho mntu konke konke.
He never had it, never will have it.	Akazange abe nayo, soze abe nayo.
He didn't think about that either.	Naye akazange acinge ngaloo nto.
He obviously was thinking about this.	Ngokucacileyo wayecinga ngale nto.
Well, this time.	Kuhle, ngeli xesha.
I saw now that it would never.	Ndabona ngoku ukuba soze.
At first, not much.	Ekuqaleni, hayi kakhulu.
Not in the afternoon, not in the evening.	Hayi emva kwemini, hayi ngokuhlwa.
There have been others.	Kuye kwakho abanye.
Then he looked at his thinking.	Emva koko wajonga ukucinga kwakhe.
Or people in the afternoon.	Okanye abantu emva kwemini.
And, needless to say, being alone.	Kwaye, akufuneki ukuthetha, ukuba wedwa.
No one is late for work.	Akukho mntu ufike emva kwexesha emsebenzini.
Or sooner.	Okanye ngokukhawuleza.
I just want to be there.	Ndifuna nje ukuba lapho.
He may not want to come.	Usenokuba akafuni ukuza.
That's a child.	Ngumntwana lowo.
This is only good.	Oku kulungile kuphela.
He spoke recently.	Wathetha kungekudala.
Not necessarily, however.	Akunjalo ukuba kufuneka, nangona kunjalo.
Nice place and well done.	Indawo entle kwaye yenziwe kakuhle.
He doesn't know it, but he really does know it.	Akayazi, kodwa ngokwenene uyazi.
That's a good thing right there.	Yinto entle leyo kanye apho.
That's a very good thing for me.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo kum.
Ready to play.	Ukulungele ukudlala.
Something else is coming.	Kuza kuza enye into.
That won't take long.	Oko akuyi kuthatha ixesha elide.
I haven't looked yet.	Khange ndijonge okwangoku.
He will get his piano soon.	Uza kufumana ipiyano yakhe kungekudala.
You knew better.	Ubusazi ngcono .
I told him my name.	Ndamxelela igama lam.
He always talks about her.	Usoloko ethetha ngaye.
He feels everything.	Uziva yonke into.
So, he knew.	Ngoko, wayesazi.
I'm sorry for all that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo yonke lonto.
And now she wants to eat.	Ke ngoku ufuna ukutya.
My improvement.	Ukuba ngcono kwam.
A place where you feel good.	Indawo apho uziva ulungile.
I never knew this before.	Andizange ndiyazi le nto ngaphambili.
He now knew why he was here.	Wayesazi ngoku ukuba kutheni elapha.
Nothing happened here.	Apha akuzange kwenzeke nto.
There is a new one almost every day.	Kukho entsha phantse yonke imihla.
It will all be very fun.	Konke kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
For any of us.	Kuba nabani na kuthi.
But he knew it well.	Kodwa wakwazi kakuhle.
She thought he looked bad.	Wayecinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakubi.
Strange.	Engaqhelekanga.
The truth is, he never had it.	Inyaniso kukuba, akazange abe nayo.
I hope you like it.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyathanda.
You never did.	Awuzange uyenze.
Sure, it's a big deal.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, yinto enkulu.
Think nothing of it.	Musa ukucinga nto ngaloo nto.
All the time and only.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kwaye kuphela.
But he made one mistake.	Kodwa wenza impazamo enye.
The answer is, as much as you want.	Impendulo kukuba, kangangoko ufuna.
I wanted to be alone.	Ndandifuna ukuhlala ndedwa.
It's a strange new thing by the way.	Yinto entsha engaqhelekanga ngendlela.
They live far away.	Bahlala kude.
He died instantly, probably.	Wafa ngoko nangoko, mhlawumbi.
You never looked at flowers.	Zange ujonge iintyatyambo.
It's okay to make a new mistake once.	Kulungile ukwenza impazamo entsha kube kanye.
I think that will mean something to me.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni kum.
She's scared like that.	Uyoyika ngolo hlobo.
I look forward to sitting down again.	Ndijonge phambili ukuhlala kwakhona.
I do not like death.	Andikuthandi ukufa.
There is something wrong here, something very wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga apha, into engalunganga kakhulu.
I want to buy one.	Ndifuna ukuthenga enye.
Well, maybe too late.	Ewe, mhlawumbi emva kwexesha kakhulu.
That's exactly it.	Leyo kanye.
Maybe for lunch.	Mhlawumbi kwisidlo sasemini.
Nobody knew what had happened, exactly.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na, kanye.
As you wish, you will be in it.	Njengoko unqwenela, uya kuba kuyo.
After a while it never happened.	Emva kwexesha ayizange yenzeke.
It would be better to say.	Kuya kuba ngcono bathi.
You play hard all night.	Udlala ngamandla ubusuku bonke.
There is always the possibility that something may be true.	Kuhlala kukho ukuba kunokwenzeka ukuba into ethile inokuba yinyani.
I wanted to know when.	Bendifuna ukwazi ukuba nini.
More than you.	Kakhulu kunawe.
And now .	Kwaye ngoku .
It has happened before and it will happen again.	Kuye kwenzeka ngaphambili kwaye kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
Maybe he tried but could not.	Mhlawumbi wazama kodwa akazange akwazi.
They say this will do it.	Bathi oku kuya kuyenza.
He is retired.	Udla umhlala-phantsi.
And so do I.	Kwaye nam, kunjalo.
I did not know my way.	Bendingayazi indlela yam.
But no one told him the truth.	Kodwa akukho mntu wamxelela inyaniso.
Hats, hats.	Umnqwazi, umnqwazi.
He learned from it.	Wafunda kuyo.
Long.	Mde .
He also took up residence.	Kwakhona wathatha indawo yokuhlala.
Other than that, he's good to talk about.	Ngaphandle koko, ulungile ukuthetha.
This is an old thing.	Le nto endala.
And then there's lunch.	Kwaye ke kukho isidlo sasemini.
But in my work, not so much.	Kodwa emsebenzini wam, hayi kakhulu.
We did this.	Senze oku.
He finally took his own life.	Ekugqibeleni wathatha ubomi bakhe.
I did my thing.	Ndiyenzile into yam.
I haven't looked since.	Khange ndijonge ukusukela oko.
He is trying to get out of the car.	Uzama ukuphuma emotweni.
I love all of that.	Ndiyayithanda yonke loo nto.
Getting out quickly would be much easier.	Ukuphuma ngokukhawuleza bekuya kuba lula kakhulu.
It will be the first one for me.	Iya kuba ngowokuqala kum.
He said he liked it.	Wathi uyayithanda.
Or just you.	Okanye wena nje.
I never did that to myself.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto kum.
And one more.	Kwaye enye kwakhona.
Hard, hard, hard.	Kunzima, kunzima, kunzima.
One of hers was not there.	Omnye wakhe wayengekho.
The new man never did.	Umntu omtsha akazange enze njalo.
If not this time, another time.	Ukuba akunjalo ngeli xesha, elinye ixesha.
If you will do the right thing.	Ukuba uya kwenza into elungileyo.
You read every day.	Ufunda yonke imihla.
What is this.	Yintoni na le.
I can't say more.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngakumbi.
But, so it happened.	Kodwa, ngoko kwenzeka.
There is just so much.	Kukho kakhulu nje.
He knows anything.	Uyakwazi nantoni na.
That's what it's going to take.	Yinto eza kuthatha.
I mean this is it.	Ndithetha ukuba yile.
If you said it was true.	Ukuba uthe yinyani.
He loves me.	Uyathanda ukuba ndim.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka senze.
But you have to do what you have to do.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze into ekufuneka uyenzile.
This is immediately apparent.	Oku kubonakala ngokukhawuleza.
Every day everyone thinks about it.	Imini yonke umntu ucinga ngayo.
We should be in prison.	Sifanele ukuba entolongweni.
Even if it is a bad thing.	Nokuba yinto embi.
Or maybe not enough.	Okanye mhlawumbi akukho ngokwaneleyo.
How to do this.	Ukwenza njani oku.
He never went high enough, he never went far enough.	Akazange aye phezulu ngokwaneleyo, akazange aye kude ngokwaneleyo.
Or his bedroom.	Okanye igumbi lakhe lokulala.
He asked me to do it again.	Wandicela ukuba ndiyenze kwakhona.
And a little more.	Kwaye kancinci ngakumbi.
If you don't want to you have to have it.	Ukuba awufuni kufuneka ube nayo.
Finally everyone knew how to make music.	Ekugqibeleni wonke umntu wayesazi indlela yokwenza umculo.
I suspect they will say yes.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba baya kuthi ewe.
He wants his chance.	Ufuna ithuba lakhe.
I'm sure your mom would like to know.	Ndiqinisekile umama wakho angathanda ukwazi.
Then once more.	Emva koko kube kanye kwakhona.
Not a bit to you.	Hayi kancinci kuwe.
He sat down next to me.	Wahlala phantsi ecaleni kwam.
I can't get out and go to him.	Andikwazi ukuphuma ndiye kuye.
One ran away.	Omnye wabaleka.
Then at school.	Emva koko esikolweni.
Some will say yes, some will say no.	Abanye baya kuthi ewe, abanye bathi hayi.
We want this.	Sifuna oku.
I will never come back.	Andiyi kubuya kwakhona.
Then he looked at the hat.	Emva koko wajonga umnqwazi.
Three forward.	Abathathu phambili.
Whether we want to talk to you or not.	Nokuba sifuna ukuthetha nawe okanye hayi.
Telling someone is a good thing.	Ukuxelela umntu yinto elungileyo.
Tell me this is good.	Ndixelele ukuba oku kulungile.
That does two things.	Oko kwenza izinto ezimbini.
His mother was just talking.	Umama wakhe wayethetha nje.
Well not.	Kuhle akunjalo.
I say everything about him.	Ndithetha yonke into ngaye.
And he too could not contain himself.	Kwaye naye akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
This is very possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
I think we did well.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle.
The only decision.	Isigqibo kuphela.
He certainly has done that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uye wakwenza oko.
He hoped she too had died.	Wayenethemba lokuba naye wafa.
He does not like to eat outside.	Akakuthandi ukutya ngaphandle.
He came to work in my office.	Weza emsebenzini eofisini yam.
However, good job.	Nangona kunjalo, umsebenzi omhle.
I don’t have it, and I never had it.	Andinayo, kwaye andizange ndibe nayo.
But we should.	Kodwa sifanele.
I'm glad that's always good.	Ndiyavuya ngoko oko kuhlala kulungile.
I saw his departure.	Ndabona ukuhamba kwakhe.
He never stopped playing.	Akazange ayeke ukudlala.
We will need you to do everything.	Siza kufuna ukuba wenze yonke into.
Thus, you may have made a mistake.	Ngaloo ndlela, kusenokwenzeka ukuba wenze impazamo.
He did not have to speak.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba athethe.
But we will definitely try.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo siza kuzama.
I can't get enough of it.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo kuyo.
He is certainly interested.	Ngokuqinisekileyo unomdla.
Some say no.	Abanye bathi akunjalo.
You do not have to think about it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ucinge ngayo.
With this, though.	Ngale nto, nangona.
When he was not with her.	Xa wayengekho naye .
He talks a lot but does little.	Uthetha kakhulu kodwa wenza kancinci.
And so do the people.	Kwaye ngoko abantu.
I didn’t think about it.	Ndandingacingi ngayo.
He must have been telling the truth about that, too.	Umele ukuba wayethetha inyaniso ngaloo nto, naye.
But for now, it's better to play together.	Kodwa okwangoku, kungcono ukudlala kunye.
I do not remember everything.	Andikhumbuli yonke into.
Death seems very difficult.	Ukufa kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
Almost everyone does the same thing.	Phantse wonke umntu wenza into efanayo.
And that's all.	Kwaye yiloo nto kuphela.
Either way this is a good thing.	Ngenye indlela le yinto elungileyo.
Everyone will want to sit next to you.	Wonke umntu uya kufuna ukuhlala ecaleni kwakho.
Just one book.	Incwadi enye nje.
Another came out of the room.	Waphuma omnye egumbini .
You need to talk a lot.	Kufuneka uthethe kakhulu.
You may know, though.	Usenokuba uyazi, nangona kunjalo.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Akukho nto kule nto.
Your dad, though.	Utata wakho, nangona kunjalo.
And so they went to prison.	Kwaye ke baya entolongweni.
Everyone started walking.	Wonke umntu waqalisa ukuhamba.
I'm sorry, so, very sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa, ngoko, uxolo kakhulu.
You only want.	Ufuna kuphela.
He spoke when he wanted to speak.	Wayethetha xa efuna ukuthetha.
Or what will happen next.	Okanye kuya kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Yes, he would do this.	Ewe, wayeza kuyenza le nto.
They say you live in this area.	Bathi uhlala kule ndawo.
He went a little faster.	Waya ngokukhawuleza kancinci.
He must be the only one.	Umele ukuba nguye yedwa.
I could not speak after that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha emva koko.
To us together.	Kuthi kunye.
Just after lunch.	Kanye emva kwesidlo sasemini.
No one ate dinner alone.	Akukho mntu watya isidlo sangokuhlwa kuphela.
Just going with the kids.	Ukuhamba nje nabantwana.
Everyone eats together.	Wonke umntu utya kunye.
She wanted to be with him again.	Wayefuna ukuba naye kwakhona.
You don't want to be that way.	Awufuni ukuba njalo.
We want money.	Sifuna imali.
Not alone, of course.	Hayi yedwa, kunjalo.
As long as you know that.	Nje ukuba uyazi loo nto.
There is a thought.	Kukho ukucinga.
Suddenly, he looked around the room.	Ngokukhawuleza, wajonga egumbini.
I can't wait to do that.	Andikwazi kulinda ukwenza oko.
I will do this again and again.	Ndiya kuyenza le nto kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
So, you want to be with him.	Ngoko, ufuna ukuba naye.
All of them .	Bonke .
My problem is this.	Ingxaki yam yile.
He got a car.	Uye wafumana imoto.
And we did this.	Kwaye senze oku.
When will it end at the end ?.	Iza kuphela nini ekugqibeleni?.
It’s very hard to find the time, though.	Kunzima kakhulu ukufumana ixesha, nangona kunjalo.
There seems to be a place back there.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho indawo emva phaya.
Just thinking about something, that's all.	Ukucinga nje ngento ethile, yiyo yonke loo nto.
And a little more.	Kwaye ngakumbi kancinci.
It will take two hours.	Kuya kuthatha iiyure ezimbini.
I will be the first, before my time.	Ndiya kuba ngowokuqala, ngaphambi kwexesha lam.
Now, alone, again.	Ngoku, eyedwa, kwakhona.
It looked great, though.	Kwakubonakala kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I have to look at that too.	Ndifanele ukuba ndijonge kuloo nto nam.
He is the one who lives here.	Nguye lo uhlala apha.
I can't do this, he thought.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto, wacinga.
But he does that.	Kodwa uyayenza loo nto.
There is certainly a better way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho indlela engcono.
If only for a few hours.	Ukuba nje iiyure ezimbalwa.
Now nothing.	Ngoku akukho nto.
That means waiting a little longer and having more time for yourself.	Oko kuthetha ukulinda kancinci kwaye ube nexesha elingakumbi kuwe.
I didn't know how to do that.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
There it is and.	Kukho apho kwaye.
Or flowers.	Okanye iintyatyambo.
I live at home now.	Ndihlala ekhaya ngoku.
You never told me about it.	Zange undixelele ngayo.
But he has.	Kodwa ukhe waba .
It can be very painful.	Kunokuba buhlungu ngokwenene.
I wonder if it would be painful.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba buhlungu na.
I arrived shortly thereafter.	Ndifike kwangoko emva koko.
We will speak well.	Siza kuthetha kakuhle.
What are you trying to do here.	Uzama ukwenza ntoni apha.
She is good, and she is better.	Ulungile, kwaye ungcono.
I know what this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
He would see that it was true.	Wayeza kubona ukuba yinyani leyo.
Then it becomes difficult.	Emva koko kuba nzima.
You will need help to make it happen.	Uza kufuna uncedo ukuze yenzeke.
Your doctor cannot work all the time.	Ugqirha wakho akakwazi ukusebenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
Nobody ever told me that.	Akukho mntu wakha wandixelela oko.
A person can be hurt.	Umntu unokuba buhlungu.
He never stopped walking.	Akazange ayeke ukuhamba.
I have to be ahead.	Kufuneka ndibe phambili.
I do it because it is good for it.	Ndiyenza kuba ilungile kuyo.
This has been difficult for all of us.	Oku kube nzima kuthi sonke.
And you are telling the truth.	Kwaye uthetha inyaniso.
You will have to come to my room.	Kuya kufuneka uze kwigumbi lam.
I don't think it will happen any other way.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
But this was not the case.	Kodwa yayingenguye lo.
Everyone can have it, and everyone should.	Wonke umntu unokuba nayo, kwaye wonke umntu kufuneka.
To walk, to walk, to walk.	Ukuhamba, ukuhamba, ukuhamba.
But he will not succeed here.	Kodwa soze aphumelele apha.
He was talking.	Wayethetha.
This time, it is.	Ngeli xesha, kunjalo.
And then all this.	Kwaye ke yonke le nto.
He is waiting to speak to us.	Ulindele ukuthetha nathi.
And that can only be good.	Kwaye oko kunokuba kuhle kuphela.
I like the house.	Ndiyayithanda indlu.
But so are we all.	Kodwa kunjalo nathi sonke.
So, yes, it is probably possible.	Ngoko, ewe, mhlawumbi kunokwenzeka.
or something like that.	okanye into enjalo.
We will do this again.	Siza kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
I knew it well.	Ndandisazi kakuhle.
She is very smart about that.	Ukrelekrele kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I thought maybe it would be hard for you.	Bendicinga ukuba mhlawumbi kuya kuba nzima kuwe.
He asked to see.	Wacela ukubona.
I have to make it better.	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngcono.
Yes, look no.	Ewe, jonga hayi.
There was no one behind him.	Kwakungekho mntu emva kwakhe.
But this is only apparent.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kuphela.
Not so much, but maybe enough.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa mhlawumbi ngokwaneleyo.
They go here, they go there.	Baya apha, baya apho.
And he works very hard.	Kwaye usebenza nzima kakhulu.
You do not have to wait for that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ulinde loo nto.
We need to be better at that.	Kufuneka sibe ngcono kuloo nto.
There are many out there.	Kukho ezininzi phaya.
Let him do this.	Makayenze le nto.
Why waiting should be so painful.	Kutheni ukulinda kufuneka kube buhlungu kangaka.
No one eats too much.	Akukho mntu utya kakhulu.
Not to do one number.	Hayi ukwenza inombolo enye.
I always go there.	Ndiya rhoqo apho.
Then another time.	Emva koko elinye ixesha.
It is time now.	Lixesha ngoku.
He told me he had done it.	Uye wandixelela ukuba uyenzile.
But, it is not easy to do.	Kodwa, akukho lula ukwenza.
Maybe that will happen.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kwenzeka.
It seems like a toy.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto yokudlala.
But it was not necessary.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko.
But mom.	Kodwa umama.
Not just dinner.	Hayi nje isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Playing football in college.	Ukudlala ibhola ekholejini.
You may be doing a great job.	Usenokuba wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
Before that, too.	Ngaphambi koko, kwakhona.
You may have done many things.	Usenokuba wenza izinto ezininzi.
He never said another word.	Akazange aphinde athethe nto.
I never thought it would be a job.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba iya kuba ngumsebenzi.
I saw nothing in him.	Andizange ndibone nto kuye.
Being a job.	Ukuba ngumsebenzi.
You never looked back.	Zange ujonge ngasemva.
You think it's weird.	Ucinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
So, not the same amount every day.	Ngoko ke, hayi imali efanayo yonke imihla.
That's the big problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki enkulu.
But if something else happens to you.	Kodwa ukuba kukho enye into eyenzekayo kuwe.
I would absolutely love to do that.	Ndingathanda ngokupheleleyo ukwenza oko.
Something happened there.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo apho.
This will take a long time.	Oku kuza kuthatha ixesha elide.
He walked away talking.	Wahamba ethetha.
Again, almost too easy.	Kwakhona, phantse lula kakhulu.
He said we want to succeed.	Uthe sifuna ukuphumelela.
But still, something is wrong.	Kodwa kunjalo, kukho into engalunganga.
You will see things in a new way.	Uza kubona izinto ngendlela entsha.
Great man, just like you.	Umntu omkhulu, njengawe.
He says he loves my daughter.	Uthi uyayithanda intombi yam.
All my friends.	Bonke abahlobo bam.
Working your way up.	Ukusebenza ngendlela yakho.
He did it once.	Wayenza kanye.
And it had to be.	Kwaye kwafuneka ukuba.
But not in that case.	Kodwa hayi kuloo meko.
I hurried to my room.	Ndihambe ngokukhawuleza ukuya egumbini lam.
Eventually it ended.	Ekugqibeleni kwaphela.
One death or many deaths.	Ukufa omnye okanye ukufa okuninzi.
I love how big it is.	Ndiyayithanda indlela enkulu ngayo.
I want to go shopping.	Ndifuna ukuya kuthenga.
It's a beautiful new thing.	Yinto entsha entle.
So it might be good.	Ngoko kunokuba kuhle.
Maybe in his car.	Mhlawumbi emotweni yakhe.
I was thinking ahead.	Bendicinga phambili.
But it really is the same thing.	Kodwa ngokwenene yinto enye.
It's harder than you think.	Kunzima kunokuba ucinga.
He made a small speech.	Wenza intetho encinci.
That's all you have to do here.	Yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyenzile apha.
We just want to talk to him.	Sifuna nje ukuthetha naye.
He knew he had to leave.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
Others.	Abanye .
Yes, it can.	Ewe, inokuba njalo.
He was just telling the truth.	Wayethetha inyani nje.
Man again.	Umntu kwakhona.
And with our time.	Kwaye kunye nexesha lethu.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba ulungile.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki ngokupheleleyo.
But they will return.	Kodwa baya kubuya.
Anyone can do this, anyone.	Nabani na angayenza le nto, nabani na.
At first there was nothing.	Ekuqaleni kwakungekho nto.
But this will happen now.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenzeka ngoku.
I can't do it myself.	Andikwazi kuyenza ngokwam.
I spend a lot of time with him.	Ndihlala naye ixesha elininzi.
Look at your son.	Jonga unyana wakho.
I can't sing any other way.	Andikwazi ukucula ngenye indlela.
And then in bed.	Kwaye emva koko ebhedini.
And don't hold back.	Kwaye musa ukuzibamba.
Yes, it will take time.	Ewe, kuya kuthatha ixesha.
He plans to move on.	Uceba ukuya phambili.
It's so much better here.	Kungcono kakhulu apha.
If it is difficult, you may be doing something wrong.	Ukuba kunzima, unokuba wenza into engalunganga.
I want this here.	Ndifuna oku apha.
Death does not exist.	Ukufa akukho.
This will make it harder to work.	Oku kuya kwenza ukuba kube nzima ukusebenza.
He doesn't know why now.	Akasazi ukuba kutheni ngoku.
No one told her that.	Akukho mntu wamxelela loo nto.
I know you are happy.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyavuya.
I think this often, very often.	Ndicinga oku rhoqo, rhoqo kakhulu.
But again that is not the case.	Kodwa kwakhona akunjalo.
There will come a time when enough is enough.	Kuza ixesha apho ngokwaneleyo ngokwaneleyo.
So he has to do it again.	Ngoko kufuneka ayenze kwakhona.
You are tired all the time.	Udiniwe ngalo lonke ixesha.
He lay on my bed.	Walala ebhedini yam.
Apparently, they stayed in bed.	Ngokucacileyo, bahlala ebhedini.
And to do well in it.	Kwaye ukwenza kakuhle kuyo.
I feel it every morning.	Ndiziva njalo ekuseni.
He is seldom seen.	Akafane abonakale.
She ran out of the room.	Wabaleka egumbini.
It will certainly happen to you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka kuwe.
For you.	Kuba wena .
It would repeat.	Bekuya kuphinda.
You will know about it.	Uya kukwazi ngayo.
I'm really happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ngawe.
Almost always.	Phantse ngalo lonke ixesha.
He asked how that could have happened.	Wabuza ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
And he will be alone here.	Kwaye uzakuba yedwa apha.
I thought that was true.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
I'd better go with you.	Kungcono ndihambe nawe.
He is here though.	Ulapha kodwa.
He took the gun and went into the room.	Wathatha umpu wangena egumbini.
He went to her and sat down.	Waya kuyo wahlala.
It doesn't have to be all the time.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube lonke ixesha.
I wanted to be.	Ndandifuna ukuba.
You have to wait here.	Kufuneka ulinde apha.
If you heard.	Ukuba weva.
I didn't, but I heard about it.	Andizange, kodwa ndive ngayo.
I could not help enough.	Khange ndikwazi ukunceda ngokwaneleyo.
Do as you are.	Wenze njengoko unjalo.
I will not have it any other way.	Andiyi kuba nayo ngenye indlela.
Impossible, but not easy.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa akukho lula.
You will never go there again.	Awuyi kuphinda uye apho kwakhona.
No one is there anymore.	Akukho mntu apho kwakhona.
Because we know.	Kuba siyazi.
We are going somewhere.	Siya kwindawo ethile.
She's looking back now.	Ujonge ngasemva ngoku.
You have a long, long time.	Unexesha elide, elide.
I did not want to go that way.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba ngaloo ndlela.
Yes, that's me.	Ewe, ndim lowo.
That will make our job easier.	Oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wethu ube lula.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into!.
Although this is where they live now.	Nangona kule ndawo bahlala kuyo ngoku.
He is not in prison.	Akakho entolongweni.
I would like a better job.	Ndingathanda umsebenzi ongcono.
Certainly a long time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ixesha elide.
He does not like death.	Akakuthandi ukufa.
I can live better with myself and do more things.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhlala ngcono nam ndenze izinto ezininzi.
If you do not want to see the house, well.	Ukuba awufuni ukubona indlu, kulungile.
And so it has to be here.	Kwaye ngoko kufuneka kube apha.
He also refused.	Kwakhona akazange avume.
Not far enough.	Akukho kude ngokwaneleyo.
You're right, you're right.	Ulungile ke, ulungile.
You will do well in that.	Uya kwenza kakuhle kuloo nto.
Or maybe, too.	Okanye mhlawumbi, kwakhona.
That never happened.	Zange yenzeke lonto.
I'm not sure that will be my thing.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kuba yinto yam leyo.
He did nothing.	Akenzanga nto.
But no one really knows what is going on.	Kodwa akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I think for now, whatever happens.	Ndicinga okwangoku, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
Currently no one.	Okwangoku akukho mntu.
Traveling there will be very difficult.	Ukuhamba apho kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
You do not have to leave now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhambe ngoku.
I don't know what he did.	Andazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
This you will find.	Oku uya kufumana.
He never did a very good job at it.	Akazange enze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngayo.
Man, he has gone, and he has done.	Umntu, uye waya, kwaye uye wenza.
We have to move forward with or not at all.	Kufuneka siye phambili kunye okanye hayi kwaphela.
He picked up his book.	Wathatha incwadi yakhe.
He was going to college.	Wayeza kuya ekholejini.
They live right now.	Bahlala khona ngoku.
You try a little harder.	Uzama kancinci.
Could it be so difficult ?.	Inokuba nzima kangaka?.
Maybe soon though.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kodwa.
Lunch there today.	Isidlo sasemini apho namhlanje.
How long do you plan to stay?	Uceba ukuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Let me see who it is.	Makhe ndibone ukuba ngubani.
I thought they would.	Ndacinga ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
He wanted to be better.	Wayefuna ukuba ngcono.
The restaurant is also very nice.	Indawo yokutyela nayo ilungile kakhulu.
He was nowhere and he was not.	Wayengekho ndawo kwaye engekho.
I think you look good.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhangeleka mhle.
I thought he was old.	Ndandicinga ukuba mdala.
You know who you want to talk to.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nabani.
He doesn't know that.	Akayazi loo nto.
You can't talk to me like that.	Awukwazi ukuthetha nam ngolo hlobo.
I'd like to try that .	Ndingathanda ukuzama lo nto .
We will not be here.	Asiyi kuba lapha.
And that's really good.	Kwaye oko kuhle ngenene.
Your mother, too.	Umama wakho, naye.
Performance is good.	Ukusebenza kulungile.
I never thought it would happen.	Khange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
But no, he thought.	Kodwa hayi, wacinga.
She told him about me.	Wamxelela ngam.
I know what happened, and when.	Ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni, kwaye nini.
A wife may be determined.	Umfazi usenokuba uzimisele.
My father never talked about it.	Utata akazange athethe ngayo.
Finally, she said yes.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi ewe.
He has not been in his residence for a long time, either.	Akazange abe kwindawo yakhe yokuhlala ixesha elide, naye.
But there was nothing in the house.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto endlwini.
We built everything ourselves.	Sakhe yonke into ngokwethu.
I want to do it quickly.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
I think not much.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho kakhulu.
But, we will not get it.	Kodwa, asiyi kufumana.
It is very difficult to go very far.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuya kude kakhulu.
Yes, thank you, thank you.	Ewe, enkosi, enkosi.
I would like to see that return.	Ndingathanda ukubona oko kubuya.
He tried again.	Wazama kwakhona.
He is talking to you.	Uthetha nawe.
But not every day.	Kodwa hayi yonke imihla.
Then, tell me.	Emva koko, ndixelele .
But he had to go to school.	Kodwa kwafuneka aye esikolweni.
He did this well.	Wayenza kakuhle le nto.
I don't want that either.	Nathi andifuni lonto.
You just made a mistake.	Wenze nje impazamo.
There was no way out.	Kwakungekho ndlela ngaphandle.
You know how it happened.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
Just look at the baby food.	Jonga nje ukuba ukutya abantwana.
And look at him now.	Kwaye jonga kuye ngoku.
He opened it, there was no one there.	Wavula, akukho mntu apho.
As much as it will take.	Kangangoko iya kuthatha.
There was nothing now.	Kwakungekho nto ngoku.
That's a big deal for me now.	Yinto enkulu leyo kum ngoku.
I can do it.	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza.
I hope you will stay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala .
I know you know it.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi.
We have moved forward ever since.	Siye phambili ukusukela ngoko.
He did something very bad.	Wenza into embi kakhulu.
I'm here for the day.	Ndilapha imini.
He did not stay silent.	Khange ahlale tu.
I was just thinking of coming to you.	Bendicinga nje ukuza kuwe.
But he does not want to talk to you.	Kodwa akafuni kuthetha nawe.
And then, yes, that's right.	Kwaye ke, ewe, kunjalo.
There he became a great man.	Apho waba yindoda enkulu.
But now there is nothing about that.	Kodwa ngoku akukho malunga naloo nto.
This has been happening for a long time.	Oku kwenzeka ixesha elide.
John has to leave tomorrow.	UJohn kufuneka ahambe ngomso.
It looks like a human being.	Kubonakala ngathi umntu.
So not really his mistake.	Ngoko ke hayi ngokwenene impazamo yakhe.
I do not remember the answer.	Andikhumbuli impendulo.
Everything is fine and good.	Yonke into ilungile kwaye ilungile.
You really have to go.	Kufuneka uhambe ngokwenene.
And, you know, it's hard.	Kwaye, uyazi, kunzima.
Location can be difficult.	Indawo inokuba nzima.
Very well done and well done.	Yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu kwaye yenziwe kakuhle.
I am my own person.	Ndingumntu wam.
Just talk to him about it.	Ukuthetha nje naye ngale nto.
Too early in it, too.	Kwangethuba kakhulu kuyo, nayo.
And he's scared, too.	Uye woyika, naye.
Now she did not know how she felt about him.	Ngoku wayengazi ukuba uziva njani ngaye.
But in all of that, people will continue.	Kodwa kuyo yonke loo nto, abantu baya kuqhubeka.
It will happen in the end.	Kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
I can't go to jail.	Andikwazi ukuya entolongweni.
He didn't think much of it.	Wayengacingi kakhulu ngayo.
He didn't know he had to, but he didn't.	Wayengazi ukuba ufanele, kodwa akazange.
The doctor looked back.	Ugqirha wajonga ngasemva.
He did not know what his answer might be.	Wayengazi ukuba inokuba yintoni impendulo yakhe.
Not here, and probably nowhere.	Hayi apha, kwaye mhlawumbi akukho ndawo.
I would like to meet you.	Ndingathanda ukudibana nawe.
You have it in him.	Unayo kuye.
Everyone in the room.	Wonke umntu kwigumbi.
Not without him.	Hayi ngaphandle kwakhe.
You can not succeed with me.	Awunako ukuphumelela kunye nam.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna nje ukuthetha naye.
So we'll start there.	Ngoko siza kuqala apho.
People will come soon.	Abantu baya kuza kungekudala.
That situation, however, did not happen here.	Loo meko, nangona kunjalo, ayizange yenzeke apha.
However, there is something unusual here.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho into engaqhelekanga apha.
You want to know what's wrong.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
You have to say no.	Kufuneka uthi hayi.
You do not have to look further.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ujonge ngakumbi.
And stop thinking too much.	Kwaye yeka ukucinga kakhulu.
And it never happened.	Kwaye akuzange kwenzeke.
One and then.	Omnye kwaye emva koko.
So really no problem.	Ngoko ngokwenene akukho ngxaki.
As you said, clearly.	Njengoko uthe, ngokucacileyo.
You can't go any further.	Awunako ukuya phambili.
You feel it all week.	Uziva uziva yonke iveki.
And it is not necessary at all.	Kwaye akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
But this is not exactly the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ncam.
Thank you .	Enkosi .
He said, it should.	Wathi, kufuneka.
You know it's okay.	Uyazi ukuba kulungile.
Yeah, a little bit this time.	Ewe, kancinci ngeli xesha.
I made this happen.	Ndenze oku ukuba kwenzeke.
Work is a thing.	Umsebenzi yinto.
I just wanted to be with him.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba nam.
He left in the morning and again in the afternoon.	Wahamba ekuseni kwaye kwakhona emva kwemini.
As long as you know.	Nje ukuba uyazi.
You don't have to want to do it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ufuna ukwenza.
I never told him why.	Zange ndamxelela nokuba kutheni.
I did not speak or see anyone.	Khange ndithethe okanye ndibone mntu.
He wouldn't have it.	Wayengayi kuba nayo.
We will not do this here.	Asiyi kuyenza le nto apha.
Even new.	Nokuba entsha.
And not just for me.	Kwaye hayi ngam kuphela.
Tell me if you know.	Ndixelele ukuba uyazi.
But we never went that way.	Kodwa asizange sihambe ngolo hlobo.
I never went again after that.	Khange ndiphinde ndiye emva koko.
I will be there for you.	Ndiza kuba lapho ngenxa yakho.
Do not go out there alone.	Musa ukuphuma apho wedwa.
Well, maybe not immediately.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
But if you do, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba uyayenza, kulungile.
And there are people out there.	Kwaye kukho abantu ngaphandle .
Ready to try anything.	Ukulungele ukuzama nantoni na.
You already know everything.	Sele uyazi yonke into.
I'm not in all of that.	Andikho kuyo yonke loo nto.
He knew it would be a plan.	Wayesazi ukuba iya kuba licebo elo.
He is now, too.	Nguye ngoku, naye.
She was afraid to come.	Wayesoyika ukuza.
Or he thought he was.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba nguye.
But do not wait.	Kodwa musa ukulinda.
So please stay away from all of this.	Ngoko ke ndicela uhlale kude kuyo yonke le nto.
Everyone else did not.	Bonke abanye abazange.
Just look this week.	Jonga nje kule veki.
And so, of course, he took his own life.	Kwaye ke, kunjalo, wathatha ubomi bakhe.
That would always be there.	Oko bekuya kuhlala kukho.
Or very beautiful.	Okanye mhle kakhulu.
Just as it always is.	Kanye njengokuba kuhlala kunjalo.
Let's go in.	Angene sihambe.
He gave me dinner.	Wandinika isidlo sangokuhlwa.
You will find his music again.	Uza kufumana umculo wakhe kwakhona.
I have never seen him without one.	Andizange ndimbone ngaphandle komnye.
You can do this with this.	Ungayenza ngale nto.
I want to get a picture.	Ndifuna ukufumana umfanekiso.
It is possible that.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba .
We know something else out there.	Siyazi enye into ngaphandle.
It's hard to be in two places at the same time.	Kunzima ukuba kwindawo ezimbini ngexesha elinye.
But anything to me.	Kodwa nantoni na kum.
Her son is lying next to her.	Unyana wakhe ulele ecaleni kwakhe.
I'm here, though.	Ndilapha, nangona kunjalo.
It could be me, for once.	Inokuba ndim, kube kanye.
You can never go home again.	Awunako ukuya ekhaya kwakhona.
You won my money.	Uphumelele imali yam.
This is something that needs to be done today.	Le yinto ekufuneka yenziwe namhlanje.
That would be very difficult to imagine.	Oko bekuya kuba nzima kakhulu ukucinga.
I think that's all, I hope you like it !.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo yonke loo nto, ndiyathemba ukuba uyathanda!.
Or that it won't take long.	Okanye ukuba akuyi kuthatha ixesha elide.
I go again.	Ndiphinde ndihambe.
I know who you live with, though.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uhlala nabani, nangona kunjalo.
And a hat.	Kwaye umnqwazi.
I don't want to see everything.	Andifuni ukubona yonke into.
You must really love him.	Umele ukuba uyamthanda ngokwenene.
For anyone really.	Kuba nabani na ngokwenene.
But not too far away.	Kodwa hayi kude kakhulu.
He wanted everyone inside before he could enter.	Wayefuna wonke umntu ngaphakathi phambi kokuba angene.
Something is happening here all the time.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha ngalo lonke ixesha.
He remains the same.	Uhleli kunjalo.
Good work.	Mhle umsebenzi.
Finally, it should.	Ekugqibeleni, kufuneka.
We'll talk more about it at dinner.	Siza kuthetha ngakumbi ngayo kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
He knew nothing about me.	Wayengazi nto ngam.
Well, we didn't.	Ewe, asizange senze.
The truth is no one really knows.	Inyaniso akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You can no longer.	Awunako kwakhona.
Let me tell you something.	Makhe ndikuxelele nje into.
Or something so unusual.	Okanye into engaqhelekanga enjalo.
You have to do it every day.	Kufuneka uyenze yonke imihla.
Or almost all of them.	Okanye phantse yonke.
I do not want to continue like that.	Andifuni kuqhubeka ngolo hlobo.
I will never talk about this again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndithethe ngale nto.
That's it.	Yiyo ke leyo.
He wanted to get her attention.	Wayefuna ukufumana ingqalelo yakhe.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akukho konke konke.
But only if no one knows.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba akukho mntu uyazi.
It seemed like that.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yiloo nto.
He says he has it in his car.	Uthi unayo emotweni yakhe.
Look what he did to you.	Jonga into ayenzileyo kuwe.
Before that it is just a little better.	Ngaphambi koko kungcono nje kancinci.
But not himself.	Kodwa hayi ngokwakhe.
Not all a lot of money.	Hayi yonke imali eninzi.
It really would be.	Ngenene bekuya kuba njalo.
It only happens once.	Kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
My going to my house.	Ukuya kwam endlini yam.
There is another exception.	Kukho enye ngaphandle.
I couldn't be with you.	Andikwazanga ukuba nawe.
Now my name.	Ngoku igama lam.
And yet, he was not.	Kwaye nangoko, wayengekho.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngoko nangoko.
No one walks behind him.	Akukho mntu uhamba emva kwakhe.
Come with it.	Weza nayo.
I got a little late.	Ndifike emva kwexesha kancinci.
I do the same thing.	Ndenza into enye.
It's you and no one else.	Nguwe hayi omnye umntu.
He never told me what to do.	Akazange andixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
He is like anything we do now.	Ufana nayo nantoni na ngoku senze ntoni.
I don't care about you.	Andikhathali ngawe.
You have it too.	Unayo nawe .
He opened the door himself.	Wavula ucango ngokwakhe.
I'll wait two hours.	Ndiza kulinda iiyure ezimbini.
He said he would probably be here for a week.	Wathi mhlawumbi uza kuba apha iveki.
But he could not.	Kodwa ke akazange akwazi.
So he stayed home.	Ngoko wahlala ekhaya.
We know everything or nothing.	Siyazi yonke into okanye akukho nto.
He said a little.	Uye wathi kancinci.
our whole answer.	impendulo yethu yonke.
I look forward to having him back.	Ndijonge phambili ukuba naye emva.
I doubt you are, but you can be.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba unjalo, kodwa unokuba njalo.
But it all happened the other way.	Kodwa konke kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
No one has spoken about this to this day.	Akukho mntu uthethe ngale nto kude kube namhlanje.
It's really hard outside.	Kunzima nyani ngaphandle.
He started eating more, talking more.	Waqalisa ukutya ngakumbi, ethetha ngakumbi.
Maybe you feel worse than I do.	Mhlawumbi uziva kakubi kunam.
Clearly, he does not like it.	Kucacile ukuba akayithandi.
I did the same thing myself.	Ndenze into efanayo nam.
You will have to stay here.	Kuya kufuneka uhlale apha.
Something happened to me there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum apho.
So, in it goes.	Ngoko, kuyo iya.
A dinner in town tonight.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa edolophini namhlanje ebusuku.
And he is trying to.	Kwaye uzama ukuba.
He came with us.	Weza nathi.
I am the whole thing.	Ndim yonke loo nto.
So there is something.	Ngoko kukho into ethile.
Because, you know, you're wasting money too.	Kuba, uyazi, nawe udlala imali.
As of today.	Ukusukela namhlanje.
And don't forget about it.	Kwaye ungalibali ngayo.
Sorry, sorry.	Uxolo, uxolo.
I don't care about that now.	Andikhathali ngaloo nto ngoku.
Then he went down to look for his mother.	Emva koko wehla waya kufuna umama wakhe.
He wanted to stay in the house.	Wayefuna ukuhlala endlini.
I never thought about it again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndicinge ngayo.
That means something.	Oko kuthetha into.
He became very difficult.	Waba nzima kakhulu.
Other than that, everything is fine.	Ngaphandle koko, konke kulungile.
But otherwise there was nothing.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko kwakungekho nto.
Also, how long will it take?	Kwakhona, kuya kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
I did not hear anything.	Andizange ndive nto.
Now you have to do it again.	Ngoku kufuneka uyenze loo nto kwakhona.
I thought a little bit about this.	Ndacinga kancinci ngale nto.
He wanted his time.	Wayefuna ixesha lakhe.
He did not make anyone.	Akenzanga mntu.
I just want to be here.	Ndifuna nje ukuba lapha.
The truth is, he did not want to try.	Inyaniso kukuba, wayengafuni kuzama.
Like he didn't know what to do with her.	Ngathi wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaye.
Me too though.	Nam nangona kunjalo.
And for me? 	Kwaye kum?
Only not so much.	Kuphela hayi kakhulu.
For him, it has happened.	Kuye, kuye kwenzeka.
I can't talk about how good it is.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngendlela entle ngayo.
I couldn't help but see.	Andikwazanga ukuzibamba kodwa ndibone.
Well, you know.	Unjalo, uyazi.
And you too.	Kwaye nawe.
Finally he spoke.	Ekugqibeleni uye wathetha.
Last night, it could be.	Phezolo, inokuba.
He asked me out loud.	Wandibuza phandle.
Maybe it will be more.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngakumbi.
Still, he would try.	Nangona kunjalo, wayeza kuzama.
He will, he will.	Uya kwenza, uya kwenza njalo.
Good or not.	Entle okanye hayi.
You, here I am.	Wena, apha nam.
But your music has spoken to me.	Kodwa umculo wakho uthethe nam.
We want something small.	Sifuna into encinci.
What should she think about him.	Kufuneka acinge ntoni ngaye.
Can you control yourself ?.	Ngaba uyakwazi ukuzibamba?.
Then you expect it to happen again.	Emva koko ulindele ukuba konke kwenzeke kwakhona.
That is certainly true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani leyo.
It will be about.	Iza kuba malunga.
So much for everyone.	Kakhulu wonke umntu.
No one, no one but me.	Akukho mntu, akukho mntu ngaphandle kwam.
But, how, he wondered.	Kodwa, njani, wazibuza.
Otherwise, it can be a little difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, kunokuba nzima kancinci.
Stop buying.	Siya kuthenga.
There is a problem in this area.	Kukho ingxaki kuloo ndawo.
Or something that means something.	Okanye into ethetha into.
He sat up fast, very fast.	Wahlala ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Although not so much.	Nangona hayi kakhulu.
Well done today.	Wenze kakuhle namhlanje.
I did not know, why.	Ndandingazi, kutheni.
You can do it, you can do it.	Ungayenza, ungayenza.
Everything has been easy for you.	Konke kube lula kuwe.
I am trying out the window.	Ndizama ifestile.
Right now.	Kanye kanye ngoku.
Although there are about.	Nangona kukho malunga.
Then it will be tonight.	Emva koko kuya kuba ngokuhlwanje.
You must be sleeping a little.	Umele ukuba ulele kancinci.
No, it's not down.	Hayi, akukho phantsi.
Just look tomorrow.	Jonga nje ngomso.
Look at your work.	Jonga umsebenzi wakho.
And there it is for all of us.	Kwaye kukho kuthi sonke.
He looks a little ugly.	Ukhangeleka kancinci.
But he wanted a place.	Kodwa wayefuna indawo.
I'll try some on that.	Ndiza kuzama ezinye ngaloo nto.
Reading, reading, or learning how to do it.	Ukufunda, ukufunda, okanye ukufunda indlela yokwenza.
Maybe not now.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngoku.
Is that a bad thing ?.	Yinto embi leyo?.
Nothing much though.	Akukho nto ingako nangona kunjalo.
Almost my age.	Phantse iminyaka yam.
It's his thing now.	Yinto yakhe ngoku.
He said, of course.	Wathi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
But the same problem.	Kodwa ingxaki efanayo.
But there is no way to do that.	Kodwa akukho ndlela yokwenza oko.
In a good way it is.	Ngendlela entle kunjalo.
She also went well.	Kwakhona uhambe kakuhle.
I don't know how you came up with it.	Andazi ukuba uze njani nayo.
There is a doctor here.	Kukho ugqirha apha.
And again in the evening comes.	Kwaye kwakhona ngokuhlwa kufika.
You really have to do it.	Ufanele ukuyenza ngenene.
Or maybe you shouldn’t.	Okanye mhlawumbi akufanele.
But for him, more.	Kodwa kuye, ngakumbi.
But that was not all.	Kodwa kwakungekho konke.
Or so the thought goes.	Okanye ke ukucinga kuhamba.
That is his age.	Nantso ke iminyaka yakhe.
You will have to do well.	Kuya kufuneka wenze kakuhle.
We will leave for maybe three days.	Siza kuhamba mhlawumbi iintsuku ezintathu.
You'd better leave before he arrives.	Kungcono uhambe ngaphambi kokuba afike.
Of course there was no one there.	Ewe kwakungekho mntu apho.
He took another job.	Wathatha omnye umsebenzi.
More than me now.	Ngaphezu kwam ngoku.
Then you have to do it completely.	Emva koko kufuneka uyenze ngokupheleleyo.
Making swimming more fun.	Ukwenza ukuqubha kube mnandi ngakumbi.
But you know that it is true.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba kunjalo.
I just saw this last night.	Ndibone nje oku ebusuku.
Anyone.	Nabani na lowo.
In this case you.	Kule meko wena.
Like you, now.	Njengawe, ngoku.
And, one more thing.	Kwaye, enye into.
Too many people in the area.	Abantu abaninzi kakhulu kwindawo.
I think there is another way.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho enye indlela.
But not like that.	Kodwa hayi ngolo hlobo.
I wanted him to, once and for all, do the right thing.	Ndandifuna ukuba, kube kanye, enze into elungileyo.
And he doesn't like it, not at all.	Kwaye akayithandi, hayi kwaphela.
I knew for a long time about it.	Ndandisazi ixesha elide ngayo.
And it has never been a big deal.	Kwaye akuzange kube yinto enkulu.
I have always been able to do it.	Bendisoloko ndikwazi ukuyenza.
This name.	Igama le.
I did not stay in the house.	Khange ndihlale endlini.
Well, yes, we made a lot of mistakes.	Kulungile, ewe, senze iimpazamo ezininzi.
He cannot succeed.	Akakwazi ukuphumelela.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho nje enye into.
I would like an answer right now.	Ndingathanda impendulo okwangoku.
He wants me to be me.	Ufuna ndibe ndim.
He had to stop thinking like that.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukucinga ngolu hlobo.
He did though.	Wenza nangona kunjalo.
Everything is fine here.	Konke kulungile apha.
I could not find a way to do that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza oko.
But the work went quickly.	Kodwa umsebenzi wahamba ngokukhawuleza.
He saw the police inside.	Wabona amapolisa ngaphakathi.
I feel naked.	Ndiziva ndize.
Not here, not in the bedroom.	Hayi apha, hayi egumbini lokulala.
I had to tell someone about it.	Kwafuneka ndixelele umntu ngayo.
It's hard for me to find the time.	Kunzima kum ukufumana ixesha.
We need to be there, too.	Kufuneka sibe lapho, nathi.
But that would mean that you love him.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuthetha ukuba uyamthanda.
You do not need anything.	Akufuneki nto.
This did not happen at all.	Oku akuzange kube njalo konke konke.
Although maybe inside.	Nangona mhlawumbi ngaphakathi.
There was no way to do that.	Kwakungekho ndlela yokwenza oko.
Look at your friends.	Jonga abahlobo bakho.
As hard as it really is.	Njengokuba kunzima ngokwenene.
Knowing what is coming before you.	Ukwazi into eza phambi kwakho.
That would be a very big deal.	Inokuba yinto enkulu kakhulu leyo.
It's really nice to retire.	Kuhle ngokwenene ukuba umhlala-phantsi.
He said he went to school every day.	Wathi uya esikolweni yonke imihla.
I thought it was good, but not good.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile, kodwa hayi kuhle.
Not long, but long.	Hayi ixesha elide, kodwa elide.
But he knew that he needed to tell her something.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka amxelele into ethile.
I'll be back soon.	Ndiza kubuya kwangoko.
So with him.	Ngoko kunye naye.
She tried, but could not speak.	Wazama, kodwa akakwazi ukuthetha.
I would love to read about it !.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngayo!.
He thinks of everything.	Ucinga ngayo yonke into.
I'm not sure how and why, but yes.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani kwaye kutheni, kodwa ewe.
You did very well.	Uyenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Coffee only for me.	Ikofu kuphela kum.
I can't tell him anything.	Andikwazi kumxelela nto.
And then they'll want me to do that.	Kwaye ke baya kufuna ukuba ndenze loo nto.
Always with friends.	Ngalo lonke ixesha nabahlobo.
You, too.	Nawe, ngaloo nto.
It will be fun though.	Kuya kuba mnandi nangona kunjalo.
He wanted to do this.	Wayefuna ukuyenza le nto.
Look forward to it !.	Jonga phambili kuyo!.
She works with the children in the park.	Usebenza nabantwana apha epakini.
So, it's very difficult.	Ngoko, kunzima kakhulu.
I would like to know how.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba njani.
I can't think of another one.	Andikwazi ukucinga ngenye.
Thank you for making this happen.	Enkosi ngokwenza oku kwenzeke.
And not so good.	Kwaye hayi entle.
I will buy.	Ndiya kuthenga.
You have to stay longer.	Kufuneka uhlale ixesha elide.
I know that.	Ndiyazi kunjalo .
The police don't know that, of course.	Amapolisa akayazi loo nto, kunjalo.
He also knew others.	Naye wayesazi abanye.
He goes home later.	Uya ekhaya kamva.
If he was to come.	Ukuba wayeza kuza.
I was thinking this morning.	Bendicinga ngale ntsasa.
He also did not agree.	Naye akazange avume.
You know, you're right.	Uyazi, ulungile.
I arrived late.	Ndifike mva.
Probably everyone too.	Mhlawumbi wonke umntu kakhulu.
That should not happen.	Akufunekanga yenzeke loo nto.
That is no question.	Oko akukho mbuzo.
None of us.	Akukho kuthi.
Then he understood why.	Emva koko, waqonda ukuba kutheni.
Others will see the time.	Abanye baya kubona ixesha.
Yes me too.	Ewe mna nam.
Well, now, he took his time.	Hayi, ngoku, wathatha ixesha lakhe.
It will be time.	Kuya kuba lixesha.
I want to know everything about you.	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into ngawe.
Everything will be fun and easy.	Konke kuya kuba mnandi kwaye kube lula.
Our job is to know everything about everyone.	Umsebenzi wethu kukwazi yonke into ngaye wonke umntu.
Not to be alone.	Hayi ukuba wedwa.
He spoke well of you.	Wathetha kakuhle ngawe.
Not this time, of course.	Hayi ngeli xesha, kunjalo.
Or talk, maybe, about that.	Okanye uthethe, mhlawumbi, ngaloo nto.
By the way, he did a great job.	Ngendlela, wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
It is happening now.	Kwenzeka ngoku.
Anyone will do.	Nabani na uya kwenza.
That was not about me.	Oko kwakungekho ngam.
It was nothing to me one way or the other.	Kwakungekho nto kum indlela enye okanye enye.
So he had to speak.	Ngoko ke kwafuneka athethe.
He thought it was entirely possible.	Wayecinga ukuba kunokwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
He wanted to say something, though.	Wayefuna ukuthetha into, nangona kunjalo.
He does it, he does it.	Uyayenza, uyayenza.
Not at all, if at all possible.	Akunjalo konke konke, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Even if you think you are, it is not.	Nokuba ucinga ukuba unjalo, akunjalo.
Anyone I ask for help.	Nabani na ndicela uncedo .
If here you go.	Ukuba apha uya.
Almost immediately it is not possible.	Phantse ngokukhawuleza akunakwenzeka.
This way then.	Ngale ndlela ke.
Well that's it.	Kulungile yiloo nto.
It will start.	Iza kuqala.
He has said.	Uye wathi.
Not outside.	Hayi phandle.
And back, together.	Kwaye ngasemva, kunye kunye.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nantoni na.
But that is not all.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo kuphela into eyenzekayo.
I'm excited about anything new.	Ndiyavuya ngayo nantoni na entsha.
The picture drives to his house.	Umfanekiso uqhuba ukuya endlwini yakhe.
We have done well enough.	Senze kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
He will do anything.	Uya kwenza nantoni na.
Doing more things at home is more common.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi kwenzeka ngakumbi ekhaya.
We did it once in a while.	Siyenze kanye ngexesha.
My father did not come.	Utata akazange eze.
I don't want to be here without him.	Andifuni ukuba lapha ngaphandle kwakhe.
He doesn't know exactly what it is.	Akayazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
What’s great ?.	Yintoni enkulu?.
I could not get there.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuya apho.
I don't really know how you do this.	Andazi nyani ukuba uyenza njani lento.
I looked everywhere but I looked at him.	Ndijonge kuyo yonke indawo kodwa ndijonge kuye.
You think of something.	Ucinga ngento.
Now tell me how.	Ngoku ndixelele ukuba njani.
When you look away.	Xa ujonge kude.
He really knew a little bit now.	Ngokwenene wayesazi kancinci ngoku.
I can't believe it now.	Andikholelwa ukuba ngoku.
She is better dressed.	Unxibe kakuhle ngakumbi.
You do not think that it is possible.	Awucingi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
It would mean waiting until tomorrow afternoon.	Bekuya kuthetha ukulinda de kube ngomso emva kwemini.
I'm going here with it.	Ndiya apha nayo.
I am and what.	Ndim kwaye yintoni.
But, now that's fine.	Kodwa, ngoku kulungile.
But when.	Kodwa xa .
Doing it for us.	Ukwenza ngathi.
That means talking more and then talking more.	Oko kuthetha ukuthetha kakhulu kwaye emva koko ukuthetha ngakumbi.
He never talked about it afterwards.	Akazange athethe ngayo emva koko.
He can't succeed, he knows.	Akakwazi ukuphumelela, uyazi.
Do not do it often.	Musa ukuyenza rhoqo.
In this case it is.	Kule meko kunjalo.
Suddenly, he returned to the top.	Ngokukhawuleza, wabuyela phezulu.
You know about.	Uyazi malunga.
She sat in the classroom.	Wahlala eklasini.
Travel does that for you.	Ukuhamba kwenza oko kuwe.
And really, you did a really good job.	Kwaye ngokwenene, wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
The doctor had to tell me.	Kwafuneka ugqirha andixelele.
But, really, it is.	Kodwa, ngokwenene, kunjalo.
Almost once.	Phantse kanye kanye.
I went once.	Ndaya kanye.
He just wanted to.	Wayefuna nje.
We will be ahead.	Siya kuba phambili.
It's a real job.	Ngumsebenzi ngenene.
This will take two to three weeks.	Oku kuya kuthatha iiveki ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
And I did it all week.	Kwaye ndenze iveki yonke.
All right, right there.	Kulungile, kanye apho.
To the side.	Ukuya ecaleni.
His thing.	Into yakhe.
This is probably okay.	Oku mhlawumbi kulungile.
I don't have my book, it's just my homework.	Andinayo incwadi yam, ngumsebenzi wam wesikolo kuphela.
But the truth is.	Kodwa inyaniso .
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba ayeke.
He told me everything.	Wandixelela yonke into.
That will require a try.	Oko kuya kufuna ukuzama.
That's it, really.	Yiyo loo nto, ngokwenene.
Not that he knew, of course.	Hayi ukuba wayesazi, kunjalo.
So tomorrow is better.	Ngoko ngomso kungcono.
It was me.	Abe ndim.
That way we will get a chance.	Ngaloo ndlela siya kufumana ithuba.
It will be tomorrow.	Iza kuba ngomso.
As it seemed impossible.	Njengoko kwakubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
There is definitely something in this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho into kule nto.
There is no way for me.	Akukho ndlela yam.
It's really hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba ngenene.
At this point, all or nothing.	Ngeli xesha, konke okanye akukho nto.
I wanted to quit.	Ndandifuna ukuyeka.
Or he is.	Okanye nguye.
So he was not everywhere.	Ngoko khange abe kuyo yonke indawo.
I'm trying to think.	Ndizama ukucinga.
I think we need to do more.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka senze ngakumbi.
In this case otherwise, it is.	Kule meko ngenye indlela, kunjalo.
I want everything right.	Ndifuna yonke into ilungile.
For a lot of money, of course.	Kuba imali eninzi, kunjalo.
Yes please.	Ewe, nceda.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze loo nto.
Well, you never knew what was going on.	Ewe, awuzange wazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
You really want to do well.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukwenza kakuhle.
He thought he could have it.	Wacinga ukuba unokuba nayo.
And it will all be after you.	Kwaye konke kuya kuba emva kwakho.
Then you just come with me.	Emva koko uze nje kunye nam.
Too much time for him to do anything about it.	Ixesha elininzi kakhulu lokuba enze nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Looks like you know.	Kubonakala ngathi uyazi.
But he lives here.	Kodwa uhlala apha.
He tried another time.	Wazama elinye ixesha.
This takes a lot of time and really hard.	Oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi kwaye kunzima ngokwenene.
Tell me how you feel about everything.	Ndixelele ukuba uziva njani ngayo yonke into.
In this way, quickly.	Ngale ndlela, ngokukhawuleza.
He just talked.	Wathetha nje.
We will know anything.	Siya kukwazi nantoni na.
Every time he went down to the top.	Ngalo lonke ixesha wehla ukuya phezulu.
All, really.	Konke, ngokwenene.
She had to go to class.	Kwafuneka aye eklasini.
I can talk to him.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha naye.
He spoke very badly.	Wathetha kakubi kakhulu.
All regularly.	Konke rhoqo.
A woman, his wife.	Umfazi, umfazi wakhe.
Everyone is convinced of it.	Wonke umntu uqinisekile ngayo.
He never wanted a wife so much.	Zange afune umfazi kangaka.
Her picture goes well.	Umfanekiso wakhe uhamba kakuhle.
There it is.	Nantso ke phaya.
I want this yesterday.	Ndifuna le izolo.
It seemed like work.	Kwakubonakala ngathi ngumsebenzi.
Just about everything about it.	Yonke nje into ngayo.
No, nobody is sitting there.	Hayi, akukho mntu uhleli apho.
He went down to her.	Wehla waya kuye.
That seems enough to me.	Oko kubonakala ngokwaneleyo kum.
And later, again.	Kwaye kamva, kwakhona.
Now you know that this is possible.	Ngoku uyazi ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
But there is something else there.	Kodwa kukho enye into apho.
He thought about this.	Wacinga ngale nto.
And so, yes, again.	Kwaye kunjalo, ewe, kwakhona.
Do not think so.	Musa ukucinga njalo.
Driving for a long time though.	Ukuqhuba ixesha elide kodwa.
No one wanted to die like that.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukufa ngolo hlobo.
I feel it every day.	Ndiziva yonke imihla.
I mean very bad.	Ndithetha embi kakhulu.
Either this will happen or it will happen.	Mhlawumbi oku kuya kwenzeka okanye kuya kwenzeka.
But when finally.	Kodwa xa ekugqibeleni.
They will be good to each other.	Baya kuba kuhle omnye komnye.
I can't work on that.	Andikwazi ukusebenza ngaloo nto.
I mean everyone knows this.	Ndithetha ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
I'm just one person.	Ndingumntu nje omnye.
My mother took the money there.	Wathatha imali apho ke umama.
I went there, too.	Ndaya apho, nam.
This can happen very well.	Oku kunokwenzeka kakuhle.
However, he heard enough.	Nangona kunjalo, weva ngokwaneleyo.
So some live far away.	Ngoko ke abanye bahlala kude.
However all this is nothing.	Nangona kunjalo konke oku akukho nto.
Thinking things through.	Ukucinga izinto kakuhle.
I want to know what happened.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
Done, but better ?.	Yenziwe, kodwa ngcono?.
Clearly, something is happening inside.	Kucacile ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo ngaphakathi.
We will continue outside.	Siza kuqhubeka ngaphandle.
He can't, of course.	Akakwazi, kunjalo.
Here, then.	Apha, emva koko.
If he has to go, he will go.	Ukuba kufuneka ahambe, uya kuhamba.
Or really life.	Okanye ngokwenene ubomi.
I thought to myself.	Ndacinga ngaphakathi kum.
Just walking will not do, you have to go faster.	Ukuhamba nje akuyi kwenza, kufuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza.
I did not know how far he would go.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba uya kude kangakanani.
This means a decision.	Oku kuthetha ukuba isigqibo.
Unless something happens.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
No one ever came.	Akukho mntu wakha weza.
Either he was talking to me or to the cat.	Inokuba wayethetha mna okanye ikati.
Sorry, and so on.	Uxolo, njalo njalo.
You do not have to say anything.	Akufunekanga uthethe nto.
No, he finally decided.	Hayi, wagqiba ekugqibeleni.
But it was certainly not necessary.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungeyomfuneko.
I'm sure they will.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
But you do not know ???.	Kodwa awuyazi???.
She thought he just loved her.	Wayecinga ukuba uyamthanda nje.
He said it was something.	Wathi yinto.
It did not happen every day.	Ayizange yenzeke yonke imihla.
There is no one way to do this.	Akukho ndlela enye yokwenza oku.
And the picture.	Kwaye umfanekiso.
But what is it?	Kodwa ingaba yintoni?
She ran back to him.	Wabaleka wabuyela kuye.
You make it my day.	Uyayenza imini yam.
He said it would get better.	Wathi kuya kuba ngcono.
Too much effort at first.	Ukuzama kakhulu ekuqaleni.
I can't come back.	Andikwazi kubuya.
Yes, for money.	Ewe, ngemali.
He does not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ayenze le nto.
You want to meet tonight.	Ufuna ukudibana ngokuhlwanje.
Down up, down up.	Phantsi phezulu, phantsi phezulu.
You have to feel like you've been here before.	Kufuneka ube ngathi ukhe waba apha ngaphambili.
You know what the problem is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Well, you probably know that by now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
And especially not you.	Kwaye ngakumbi hayi wena.
He would try that first.	Wayeza kuzama oko kuqala.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani .
There are people out there.	Kukho abantu apha phandle.
It's very hard to have him here now.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuba naye apha ngoku.
I did everything myself, room at a time.	Ndenze konke ngokwam, igumbi ngexesha.
I never thought it could be, though.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba inokuba yintoni, nangona kunjalo.
Then in this way.	Emva koko ngolu hlobo.
Impossible but not impossible.	Akunakwenzeka kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He was afraid to die.	Wayesoyika ukufa.
But that is good for me.	Kodwa oko kulungile kum.
So it's not there.	Ngoko akukho apho.
This will come to me soon.	Oku kuya kuza kum kungekudala.
And besides, that probably isn't the case at all.	Kwaye ngaphandle, mhlawumbi akunjalo konke konke.
And, by the way.	Kwaye, ngendlela.
He is sitting far away.	Uhleli kude.
So we need your help urgently.	Ngoko sifuna uncedo lwakho ngokukhawuleza.
Working is hard.	Ukusebenza kunzima.
Do you want to stay with him.	Ngaba uyafuna ukuhlala naye.
He couldn't control himself, you know.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba, uyazi.
Certainly at this time, nothing will happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngeli xesha, akukho nto iya kwenzeka.
Please come to the house.	Ndicela uze endlini.
This can be very simple.	Oku kunokuba lula kakhulu.
And now the answer.	Kwaye ngoku impendulo.
This can be easy.	Oku kunokuba lula.
That is a long time away from your children.	Lixesha elide elo lokuba kude nabantwana bakho.
Or no, you know.	Okanye hayi, uyazi.
I can't take that too seriously right now.	Andikwazi ukuthatha kakhulu oko ngoku.
Yes but no.	Ewe kodwa hayi.
There is no time to do anything.	Akukho xesha lokwenza nantoni na.
He stayed here a long time.	Wahlala apha ixesha elide.
Something really, really bad.	Into ngenene, embi kakhulu.
Or anyone in the room.	Okanye nabani na egumbini.
Why did he stay.	Kwakutheni ukuze ahlale.
For my father to go home.	Ukuze utata ahambe ekhaya.
He will be alone in his place.	Uzakuba yedwa kwindawo yakhe.
No no no, it's not.	Hayi hayi hayi, akunjalo.
Thanks for all the questions.	Enkosi ngayo yonke imibuzo.
All together, a little.	Konke kunye, kancinci.
I think people.	Ndicinga ukuba abantu.
It's too far for everything.	Kude kakhulu kuyo yonke into.
No, he agreed.	Hayi, wavuma.
However finding the opportunity to do that is difficult.	Nangona kunjalo ukufumana ithuba lokwenza oko kunzima.
He never suggested anything.	Zange wacebisa nantoni na.
So anyway.	Ngoko nangona kunjalo.
You think this should not be the case.	Ucinga ukuba oku akufanele kube njalo.
For there is absolutely nothing in it.	Kuba akukho nto ngokupheleleyo kuyo.
And we will, too.	Kwaye siya kwenza, nathi.
The earlier the better.	Ngaphambili ngcono.
It just so happened.	Kwenzeka kunjalo.
And it was very easy.	Kwaye kube lula kakhulu.
But not taking money.	Kodwa hayi ukuthatha imali.
Yes you know.	Ewe uyayazi.
As it happens, it is not.	Njengoko kwenzeka, akunjalo.
I am convinced that there is a better way.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho indlela entle ngakumbi.
She's busy but okay.	Uxakekile kodwa kulungile.
We all know this.	Siyazi sonke le nto.
But everyone knows everything about you.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyazi konke ngawe.
Maybe it would be difficult.	Mhlawumbi bekuya kuba nzima.
They will do it one day.	Baya kuyenza imini enye.
It's just not that.	Kuphela akunjalo nje.
It has to be this way.	Kumele kube ngolu hlobo.
I'll see, if you ever come back to me.	Ndiza kubona, ukuba ukhe wabuyela kum.
Mary thought about that question.	UMariya wacinga ngalo mbuzo.
I'm coming for you.	Ndiza kuwe .
What have we done ?.	Senze ntoni?.
You are welcome to attend at this time.	Ukhona ukuba ube khona ngeli xesha.
Yes, you can.	Ewe, unokuba njalo.
Not in my car.	Hayi emotweni yam.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele kuyo.
He never said this, or anything.	Akazange athethe le nto, okanye nantoni na.
Again in this case, the other person has no voice.	Kwakhona kule meko, omnye umntu akanalo ilizwi.
This can be really true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani ngokwenene.
Just the way.	Indlela nje.
It certainly seemed that way to me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakubonakala ngolo hlobo kum.
I thought it was weird.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
He stays in his room all day.	Uhlala egumbini lakhe imini yonke.
We only know that well.	Siyazi kakuhle loo nto kuphela.
He did not know when that would be.	Wayengazi ukuba iya kufika nini na.
He did not immediately approach her.	Akazange aye kuye ngokukhawuleza.
I did well.	ndenze kakuhle.
I want her to come to my bed.	Ndifuna afune ukuza ebhedini yam.
Once and for all.	Kanye kwaye konke.
Or my mom or dad.	Okanye umama okanye utata wam.
But for now it is not too far away.	Kodwa okwangoku akukho kude kakhulu.
How do you know.	Wazi njani wena .
In the end, there was none.	Ekugqibeleni, kwakungekho namnye.
I'm happy about this.	Ndiyavuya ngale nto.
My wife lives alone at home.	Umfazi wam uhleli yedwa ekhaya.
She looks good to him.	Ufana naye kakuhle.
And you can't tell.	Kwaye awukwazi ukuxelela.
He wanted her to tell the truth.	Wayefuna ukuba athethe inyani.
It is good to be able to get hours.	Kuhle ukuba ukwazi ukufumana iiyure.
Someone asked me what had happened.	Umntu wandibuza ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Or otherwise.	Okanye ngenye.
He promised to do so.	Wathembisa ukwenjenjalo.
But, you really want more.	Kodwa, ngokwenene ufuna ngakumbi.
Not only that.	Kuphela akunjalo.
It takes you.	Kuthatha wena.
Death is sudden, death is sudden.	Ukufa ngokukhawuleza, ukufa ngokukhawuleza.
There is one more thing.	Kukho enye into kwakhona.
That is really hard to see.	Oko ngenene kunzima ukubona.
He wanted to find peace.	Wayefuna ukufumana uxolo.
I never knew it could happen.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba inokuba njalo.
I really couldn’t tell you why.	Ngenene andikwazanga ukukuxelela ukuba kutheni.
Not really, it just seems to be the case.	Akunjalo ngokwenene, kubonakala kunjalo nje.
I'm not even sure what you think.	Nam andiqinisekanga ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I should have been here first.	Bekufanele ukuba ndilapha kuqala.
Not time or money.	Hayi ixesha okanye imali.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ungcono ngomso.
It will come soon.	Iza kufika ngokukhawuleza.
I can't talk too much about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu ngayo.
And you know what.	Kwaye uyazi yintoni.
I know very little about you.	Ndiyazi kancinci kakhulu ngawe.
If so, nothing will happen.	Ukuba kunjalo, akukho nto iya kwenzeka.
Without saying a word, he sat down.	Khange athethe, wahlala phantsi.
Death, right in this situation.	Ukufa, kulungile kule meko.
But this should not be the case.	Kodwa oku akufanele kube njalo.
You will do it alone.	Uya kuyenza wedwa.
At the moment, there is nothing in it.	Okwangoku, akukho nto kuyo.
Well almost all.	Kulungile phantse bonke.
But even this is not the case.	Kodwa nangona oku akunjalo.
Not if it is possible, but if it is possible.	Akunjalo ukuba kunokwenzeka, kodwa ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I think you like it there.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda apho.
But then, nothing.	Kodwa emva koko, akukho nto.
Or if not, then.	Okanye ukuba akukho, ngoko.
There is one problem.	Kukho ingxaki enye.
Tom had to stay.	UTom kwafuneka ahlale.
I do other things.	Ndenza ezinye izinto.
He did just that.	Wenza ngolo hlobo.
It is good to learn more.	Kulungile ukufunda ngakumbi.
I try harder.	Ndizama ngakumbi.
He never ate again.	Akazange aphinde atye.
A week later, he tried to do just that.	Kwiveki kamva, wazama ukwenza loo nto kanye.
He just understood.	Waqonda nje.
Reading is hard.	Ukufunda kunzima.
I would like to do something else.	Ndingathanda ukwenza enye into.
So he began to eat.	Ngoko waqalisa ukutya.
Now he is a good man.	Ngoku yindoda elungileyo.
What's going on here?	Kuqhubeka ntoni apha?
And what happened last night.	Kwaye kwenzeke ntoni phezolo.
I'm not leaving now.	Khange ndihambe mna ngoku.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange abe ncam.
No, there was nothing.	Hayi, kwakungekho nto.
But so is everything else.	Kodwa kunjalo yonke enye into.
He came to my side.	Weza ecaleni kwam.
I thought so too, but that is not the case.	Nam bendicinga njalo, kodwa akunjalo.
But you think so.	Kodwa ucinga njalo.
Good to be here.	Kuhle ukuba ulapha.
It will not be difficult for you.	Akuyi kuba nzima kuwe.
He thought of time.	Wacinga ngexesha.
He spoke openly about it.	Wathetha phandle ngayo.
Absolutely human.	Umntu ngokupheleleyo.
She has been hurt because of him.	Uye waba buhlungu ngenxa yakhe.
Making a party too late at night.	Ukwenza itheko ebusuku kakhulu.
Not only recently.	Hayi mva nje kwaphela.
We won't have another day or so.	Asiyi kuba nayo enye imini okanye njalo.
Very sorry for the night.	Uxolo kakhulu ebusuku.
She has understood.	Uye waqonda.
People together.	Abantu kunye.
His father thought so.	Utata wakhe wayecinga njalo.
I only wish peace.	Ndinqwenela uxolo kuphela.
About my children.	Malunga nabantwana bam.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi ngam.
This must have been difficult for her.	Oku kumele ukuba kunzima kuye.
Then, and only then, you can be right.	Emva koko, kwaye kuphela emva koko, unokuba ulungile.
I don't really want to, you know.	Andifuni ngokwenene, uyazi.
I think he thought the same thing about me.	Ndicinga ukuba wayecinga into efanayo ngam.
It should not be difficult this way.	Akufanele kube nzima ngale ndlela.
Clearly, he did not know.	Ngokucacileyo, wayengazi.
He would love to talk to you.	Angathanda ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe.
I wonder how long it will last.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
He finally looked at his phone.	Wagqiba wajonga ifowuni yakhe.
He can do whatever he wants.	Uyakwazi ukwenza yonke into ayifunayo.
Stay or go.	Ndihlale okanye ndihambe.
I better go now.	Ngcono ndihambe ngoku.
It is not easy to be your friend.	Akukho lula ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
I need help.	Ndicela uncedo .
Almost there, but not exactly.	Phantse phaya, kodwa hayi ncam.
I did not want him to talk.	Bendingafuni athethe.
I need to know what that is.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
As this work will be.	Njengoko lo msebenzi uya kuba.
You will be a good friend to me.	Uza kuba ngumhlobo olungileyo kum.
I do not want to.	Andifuni mna.
Well, you can do that.	Kulungile, ungayenza loo nto.
You feel like you want to quit.	Uziva ufuna ukuyeka.
You know you're busy.	Uyayazi ukuba uxakekile.
We know why.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni.
He did not want to be behind.	Wayengafuni kuba ngasemva.
There is nothing to do.	Akukho ukwenza nantoni na.
How he got there.	Wafika njani apho.
Yes, it must be.	Ewe kumele ukuba nguye lo.
If you just go, fine.	Ukuba uhamba nje, kulungile.
Not in one place, but everywhere.	Hayi kwindawo enye, kodwa yonke indawo.
I tried very hard.	Ndazama kakhulu.
And man, man.	Ke umntu, umntu.
He can't stop thinking about it.	Akakwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngaloo nto.
We're going up there.	Siya phaya phezulu.
You can do just that.	Ungayenza loo nto kanye.
And then he tried again.	Kwaye emva koko wazama kwakhona.
Soon, though.	Kungekudala, nangona kunjalo.
We will do it ourselves this time.	Siza kuyenza ngokwethu ngeli xesha.
Mostly everyone knows.	Kakhulu wonke umntu uyazi.
I did something wrong.	Ndenze into embi.
I tried very hard.	Ndazama ngamandla.
And last but not least.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni kodwa mhlawumbi.
Trying to be human.	Ukuzama ukuba ngumntu.
So it's hard to work or whatever.	Ngoko kunzima ukusebenza okanye nantoni na.
This is the job, after all.	Lo ngumsebenzi, emva koko.
She speaks with her eyes.	Uthetha amehlo akhe.
She would love that.	Angathanda oko.
In all of this.	Kukho konke oku.
Probably for sure.	Mhlawumbi ngokuqinisekileyo.
It is better to drive.	Kungcono ukuqhuba.
I will surely do as you please.	ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kwenza njengoko uthanda.
And more is needed.	Kwaye okuninzi kufuneka.
And all the other people.	Kwaye bonke abanye abantu.
And without him.	Kwaye ngaphandle kwakhe.
I will come with it.	Ndiza kuza nayo.
I never thought anyone would be like that.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba nabani na uya kuba njalo.
Or to me, maybe.	Okanye kum, mhlawumbi.
That's probably a few years out.	Oko mhlawumbi iminyaka embalwa ngaphandle.
However, you need money to do that.	Nangona kunjalo, ufuna imali ukwenza oko.
He said a lot more.	Wathetha okuninzi ngakumbi.
Prolonged reading makes this possible.	Ukufunda ixesha elide kwenza ukuba oku kwenzeke ngakumbi.
No time though.	Akukho xesha kunjalo.
You can be up there for sure.	Unokuba phaya phezulu ngokuqinisekileyo.
And he certainly was talking about her.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo wayethetha ngaye.
I'd like to have one.	Ndingathanda ukufumana enye.
But again, you think too much.	Kodwa kwakhona, ucinga kakhulu.
For as long as you want.	Kuba ixesha elide njengoko ufuna.
Even so .	Nangona kunjalo .
Money is right.	Imali ilungile.
And he is not even who you think he is.	Kwaye ayinguye nokuba ucinga bani.
Well, that's a small thing.	Kulungile, yinto encinci leyo.
However we will come back for lunch or dinner immediately.	Nangona kunjalo siza kubuya ngesidlo sasemini okanye isidlo sangokuhlwa kwangoko.
And they will hurt it.	Kwaye baya kuyenza buhlungu.
Fast or slow.	Ngokukhawuleza okanye kancinci.
But, he thought, he thought.	Kodwa, wacinga, wacinga.
I looked and looked again.	Ndijonge kwaye ndijonge kwakhona.
Then he tried again.	Emva koko wazama kwakhona.
Back to the beginning.	Emva ekuqaleni.
Then we will have lunch.	Emva koko siza kutya isidlo sasemini.
It seems a long time ago now.	Kubonakala kudala kakhulu ngoku.
We definitely want something new.	Ngokuqinisekileyo sifuna into entsha.
But this morning.	Kodwa namhlanje ekuseni .
He is not without me.	Akakho ngaphandle kwam.
He was left, but not too much.	Wayesele, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He decided to go home.	Wagqiba ekubeni agoduke.
It would have been nice to have her back then.	Bekuya kuba kuhle ukuba naye ngelo xesha.
You really, really, really wish.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene, unqwenela ngokwenene.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
Everyone thinks this way.	Wonke umntu ucinga ngolu hlobo.
Now everyone has to bring it every night.	Ngoku wonke umntu kufuneka eze nayo rhoqo ebusuku.
I live in that, too.	Ndihlala kuloo nto, nam.
I don’t want to think too much.	Andifuni ukucinga kakhulu.
He doesn't think, though.	Akacingi, nangona kunjalo.
You have done a wonderful thing today.	Wenze into entle kakhulu namhlanje.
Why.	Kutheni kutheni.
I ask for help if possible.	Ndicela uncedo ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Not myself.	Hayi ngokwam.
Then he started walking.	Emva koko waqalisa ukuhamba.
He does not think that he will stay long.	Akacingi ukuba uya kuhlala ixesha elide.
Not much here.	Akukho nto ingako apha.
This is difficult, and difficult.	Oku kunzima, kwaye kunzima.
I want a meal.	Ndifuna isidlo.
I can't take too much.	Andikwazi ukuthatha kakhulu.
It is certainly good to learn from you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kulungile ukufunda kuwe.
I really want to help.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukunceda.
Look at the dog.	Jonga inja.
And this is good in this case.	Kwaye oku kulungile kule meko.
I think that means you are a better person now.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuthetha ukuba ungumntu ongcono ngoku.
It is impossible to know.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
Well, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ekugqibeleni.
You look so much like him, you know.	Ufana naye kakhulu, uyazi.
He's just here.	Ulapha nje.
I'm looking for one.	Ndijonge enye.
One in front of you.	Omnye phambi kwakho.
I want everyone to know what happened to me.	Ndifuna wonke umntu azi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngam.
I can't wait to see more.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukubona ngakumbi.
Moreover, he did not know.	Ngaphezu koko, wayengazi.
But this takes a lot of time.	Kodwa oku kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
He would not make it easy.	Wayengayi kwenza lula.
Stop one thing.	Yeka into enye.
I hope something happens soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kukho into eza kwenzeka kungekudala.
He just does things.	Wenza nje izinto.
Then he went into his house.	Emva koko wangena endlwini yakhe.
Now this is when.	Ngoku oku xa.
He said he did not speak.	Wathi zange athethe.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Mhlawumbi nantso indlela.
Something bad happened last night.	Kwenzeke into embi apha phezolo.
I'm going to need your help, you know.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo lwakho, uyazi.
That all means.	Konke oko kuthetha.
He is not exactly in it.	Akakho ncam kuyo.
He pulled out a gun.	Ufike wakhupha umpu.
There it is.	Nantso ke apho.
I thought so at the time.	Ndandicinga njalo ngelo xesha.
One person to another.	Umntu komnye.
Yes yes, and no.	Ewe ewe, kwaye hayi.
But he doesn't know anything about it.	Kodwa akazi nto ngayo.
Well, they are everywhere.	Ke, bakho kuyo yonke indawo.
Finally, she returned to him.	Ekugqibeleni, wabuyela kuye.
In the meantime, we will wait.	Ngeli xesha, siza kulinda.
He did well in it.	Wenza kakuhle kuyo.
Not now, but finally.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
That's what everyone wants.	Yiloo nto wonke umntu ayifunayo.
It happens all the time, in the same place.	Kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha, indawo efanayo.
Only now.	Kuphela ngoku.
He would certainly have gone easy without her.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuhamba lula ngaphandle kwakhe.
He told me that this was his job.	Wandixelela ukuba ngumsebenzi wakhe lowo.
One is this.	Enye yile.
This will be you, soon.	Oku kuya kuba nguwe, kungekudala.
He did not do many things.	Akazange enze ezininzi.
He stayed there all night with her.	Wahlala apho naye ubusuku bonke.
How far they will go with it together.	Baza kuhamba kude kangakanani ngayo kunye.
We'll see what you think.	Siza kubona ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Certainly not you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi wena.
I wanted to talk to you before.	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe ngaphambili.
We know what that is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
As he did so he saw something strange.	Uthe xa esenza njalo wabona into engaqhelekanga.
I never told my father.	Khange ndimxelele utata.
He didn't do much.	Akenzanga kakhulu.
Not two, not here.	Hayi ezimbini, hayi apha.
I want more than that.	Ndifuna ngaphezu koko.
You have to be real.	Kufuneka ube yinyani.
I want to know the whole story.	Ndifuna ukwazi lonke ibali.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally?	Uziva ngathi kudala?.
You will not need food there.	Awuyi kufuna ukutya apho.
Not just one or two.	Hayi nje enye okanye ezimbini.
But this does not have to be.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
You know .	Uyazi .
As it looks great.	Njengoko kubonakala kakhulu.
It will continue for years to come.	Kuya kuqhubeka iminyaka ezayo.
I have to talk now.	Kufuneka ndithethe ngoku.
See what you are wearing outside.	Jonga ukuba unxibe ntoni ngaphandle.
And I want to know, just as I do.	Kwaye ndinqwenela ukwazi, kanye kunye nam.
It’s better that way, though.	Kungcono ngolo hlobo, nangona kunjalo.
I will, of course.	Ndiza, kunjalo.
No one should know anything.	Akukho mntu umele azi nto.
That's why he ran so fast.	Yiyo loo nto wabaleka kakhulu.
This, of course, is not entirely possible.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
It has not been easy.	Khange kube lula.
The truth is, that's fine.	Inyaniso kukuba, kulungile.
That's what happens at this time.	Nantso into eyenzekayo ngeli xesha.
That happens to almost everyone.	Oko kwenzeka phantse wonke umntu.
He spent time in prison.	Wachitha ixesha entolongweni.
Not that he will ever be so.	Akunjalo ukuba uya kuze abe njalo.
She is usually the first child in the morning.	Udla ngokuba ngumntwana wokuqala kusasa.
But that is not the problem here.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo ingxaki apha.
You have to think before you act.	Kufuneka ucinge phambi kokuba wenze.
Just when something bad happens to you.	Kanye xa kwenzeka into embi kuwe.
That's what you always try.	Nto leyo uhlala uzama.
You never did it that way.	Zange uyenze ngolo hlobo.
And it's not over.	Kwaye akukho phezulu.
I never talked about it.	Andizange ndithethe ngayo.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi .
He fell asleep again.	Walala kwakhona.
He knew, and probably knew, too.	Wayesazi, kwaye mhlawumbi wayesazi, naye.
Yeah, just finishing up.	Ewe, ukugqiba nje.
Yes, even though you drive.	Ewe, nangona uqhuba.
Nice to talk to you.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha nawe.
And then it should.	Kwaye ke kufuneka.
I did not want to go to prison.	Ndandingafuni ukuya entolongweni.
You mean everything now.	Uthetha yonke into ngoku.
You look good today.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle namhlanje.
You and us ?.	Wena kunye nathi?.
He wants to do the right thing.	Unqwenela ukwenza into elungileyo.
It will happen the other way around.	Kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
But he did not go there.	Kodwa akazange aye apho.
Or another one in my house.	Okanye enye endlwini yam.
He got one first.	Wafumana enye kuqala.
But he could not find any other way.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukufumana enye indlela.
He's busy, after all.	Uxakekile, emva koko.
We will not go that far.	Asiyi kude kangako.
In all of that.	Kuyo yonke loo nto.
Every day he knew what death was.	Yonke imihla wayesazi ukuba yintoni ukufa.
We want money fast.	Sifuna imali ngokukhawuleza.
My son loves it.	Unyana wam uyayithanda.
For my work, of course, and for you.	Ngomsebenzi wam, ngokuqinisekileyo, kunye nawe.
So what did he do.	Wenza ntoni ke.
Please think.	Nceda ucinge.
He will continue.	Uya kuqhubeka.
But there is no turning back.	Kodwa akukho kubuya.
I would love that, though.	Ndingathanda ukuba, nangona kunjalo.
No, he did not know when he would return.	Hayi, wayengazi ukuba uza kubuya nini.
We have to do it right.	Kufuneka siyenze kakuhle.
I'm afraid there.	Ndiyoyika kukho.
You just feel things with energy.	Uziva nje izinto ngamandla.
I think it will happen.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
I never thought this would happen.	Zange ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
Our good cat.	Ikati yethu elungileyo.
I know he did not speak.	Nam ndiyazi khange athethe.
He knew that had to happen.	Wayesazi ukuba oko kumele kwenzeke.
You will have to be in one place.	Kuza kufuneka ube kwindawo enye.
He just made it more real.	Uyenzile nje ukuba yinyani ngakumbi.
Stop trying to figure things out.	Yeka ukuzama ukucinga izinto.
He knew this job would be difficult.	Wayesazi ukuba lo msebenzi uzakuba nzima.
I have learned a lot now.	Ndifunde kakhulu ngoku.
Not his way, though.	Hayi indlela yakhe, nangona kunjalo.
Everyone knows it very, very well.	Wonke umntu uyazi kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
He said he would make it happen.	Wathi uya kuyenza ukuba yenzeke.
He just kept going.	Uye waqhubeka nje.
I'm glad you're asleep in all of that.	Ndiyavuya ukuba ulele kuyo yonke loo nto.
But the lamp.	Kodwa isibane.
Or the truth.	Okanye inyaniso.
You can be here.	Unokuba lapha.
I go every day.	Ndiya yonke imihla.
Or maybe wait.	Okanye mhlawumbi ukulinda.
He looked out the window.	Wajonga ifestile.
Certainly, as much as possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
I want you here.	Ndifuna wena apha.
But he knew that he would never do such a thing.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akanakuze enze into enjalo.
Something very unusual is happening.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga kakhulu eyenzekayo.
Not some of your friends.	Hayi abanye abahlobo bakho.
Because you told me everything yesterday.	Kuba undixelele yonke into izolo.
I am alone.	Ndim ndedwa .
He will stay with it.	Uya kuhlala nayo.
One of mine.	Enye yam.
No matter how long you want it.	Nokuba ufuna ixesha elide kangakanani na.
Not really, everywhere.	Hayi ngokwenene, yonke indawo.
We'll be up all night anyway.	Siya kuba ubusuku bonke nokuba kunjalo.
I never thought he would do it.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba angayenza.
No, certainly not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kuye.
How to do one thing and only one thing.	Indlela yokwenza into enye kwaye into enye kuphela.
He must have been thinking of something else.	Umele ukuba wayecinga ngenye into.
Same thing every day for a month.	Into efanayo yonke imihla kwinyanga.
Not so much, for sure.	Hayi kakhulu, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Just a good thing.	Into nje elungileyo.
He has done that before.	Ukhe wayenza loo nto ngaphambili.
Not just one thing.	Hayi nje into enye.
But today.	Kodwa namhlanje.
Like, you know that's right.	Njengoko, uyazi ukuba kunjalo.
Another died later.	Omnye umntu wafa kamva.
He did not know when she left.	Wayengazi ukuba wahamba nini.
But otherwise, that really isn't the case.	Kodwa ngenye indlela, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Probably because it will be a big job.	Mhlawumbi ngenxa yokuba iya kuba ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
That's not really me.	Ayindim ngokwenene lowo.
And there is no place to stay.	Kwaye akukho ndawo yokuhlala.
I live there every day.	Ndihlala apho yonke imihla.
I want my dinner.	Ndifuna isidlo sam sangokuhlwa.
But my father is not here.	Kodwa utata akakho.
He has only done his job.	Wenze kuphela umsebenzi wakhe.
Although he was afraid, he had to admit it.	Nangona wayesoyika, kwafuneka avume.
It's hard to know what to do about it.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni ngale nto.
Faster than he thought.	Ngokukhawuleza kunokuba wayecinga.
Just me.	Ngam nje.
Or in prison, obviously.	Okanye entolongweni, ngokucacileyo.
He knew he had to stop.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ayeke.
You have obviously done this before.	Ngokucacileyo uyenzile le nto ngaphambili.
I think it won't be any problem for you.	Ndicinga ukuba akuyi kuba nayiphi na ingxaki kuwe.
And immediately it happened.	Kwaye ngoko nangoko kwenzeka.
My father is with her now.	Utata ukhona naye ngoku.
I had no idea why, really.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
He is a better person.	Ungumntu ongcono.
I don't know, he thought.	Andazi, wacinga.
He did a little bit of it.	Wenza kancinci kuyo.
He tried to imagine what it could be like.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba inokuba njani.
Unless it will be much better.	Ngaphandle kokuba kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu.
This is a big deal for me.	Le yinto enkulu ngam.
What do you want to do first?	Ufuna ukwenza ntoni kuqala.
He opened the door.	Uye wavula ucango.
That is exactly what happened to me.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kum.
We didn't but we had to.	Asizange senze kodwa kufuneka.
Yeah, just one.	Ewe, enye nje.
You have made a lot of money.	Wenze imali eninzi.
I just want to finish.	Ndifuna nje ukugqiba.
Everyone knew everyone.	Wonke umntu wayesazi wonke umntu.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi ncam.
It's hard, but it is.	Kunzima, kodwa kunjalo.
He's running everything now.	Uqhuba yonke into ngoku.
We want better.	Sifuna ngcono.
Tell me now where you are.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba uphi.
I'm sure you know.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi.
But he eventually went to work.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waya emsebenzini.
It's a really good time.	Lixesha elihle ngokwenene.
You have to tell me that.	Kufuneka undixelele njalo.
I mean that, too.	Ndithetha loo nto, nam.
He lives too far away.	Uhlala kude kakhulu.
So there really is nothing.	Ngoko akukho nto ngokwenene.
He sat for a while.	Wahlala kancinci.
She was beautiful.	Waba mhle.
I will do it again tomorrow.	Ndiza kuphinda ngomso.
He will not do anything.	Akayi kwenza nantoni na.
And he was able to do it.	Kwaye wakwazi ukuyenza.
All very well.	Konke kakuhle kakhulu.
That's ours.	Yethu leyo.
Although he wanted nothing from her.	Nangona wayengafuni nto kuye.
He asked other people.	Wabuza abanye abantu.
But in such a place.	Kodwa kwindawo enjalo.
You are really lucky, this is with us today.	Unethamsanqa ngokwenene, oku kunye nathi namhlanje.
To us that sounds good.	Kuthi oko kubonakala kulungile.
He slept alone.	Walala yedwa.
Voice making is very good.	Ukwenza ilizwi kuhle kakhulu.
You will earn money.	Uza kufumana imali.
But you can't do anything about this problem.	Kodwa awukwazi ukwenza ntoni ngale ngxaki.
He asked me all that.	Wandibuza yonke loo nto.
He knew for sure.	Wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Not everyone, of course.	Akunjalo wonke umntu, kunjalo.
I think not.	Ndicinga ukuba hayi.
But that will happen later.	Kodwa oko kuya kwenzeka kamva.
He can't walk.	Akanakukwazi ukuhamba.
So today we will not do it.	Ngoko namhlanje asiyi kuyenza.
I didn't have to tell anyone.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ndixelele mntu.
And again there and then he went again.	Kwaye kwakhona apho kwaye emva koko wahamba kwakhona.
He went down further.	Wehla ngakumbi.
No, what ?.	Hayi, yintoni?.
I will speak a word.	Ndiza kuthetha ilizwi.
Many, many others.	Abaninzi, abanye abaninzi.
Except maybe this one.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi lo.
It is strange to say.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ukuyithetha.
Someone who wants a chance.	Umntu ofuna ithuba.
I do not have a dog.	Andinayo inja.
For as long as possible.	Ixesha elide kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
Too much thinking.	Ukucinga kakhulu.
Better for him, too.	Kungcono kuye, naye.
It will last a long time.	Kuya kuphela ixesha elide.
So this is a big deal.	Ngoko le yinto enkulu.
I look forward to playing these.	Ndijonge phambili ukudlala ezi.
Or maybe something completely different.	Okanye mhlawumbi enye into ngokupheleleyo.
Getting a name.	Ukufumana igama.
This one does very well.	Lo wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
This way it will be better for both of us.	Ngale ndlela kuya kuba kuhle kuthi sobabini.
And not just in the classroom.	Kwaye hayi eklasini kuphela.
The picture is good.	Umfanekiso ulungile.
Only impossible.	Kuphela akunakwenzeka.
And we will do more.	Kwaye siya kwenza ngakumbi.
You know very well.	Ukwazi kakuhle kakhulu.
I saw the same thing.	Ndabona into enye.
You know it never happened.	Uyazi ukuba akuzange kube njalo.
He is the one who wants something from me.	Nguye ofuna into kum.
He suggested that she stay here for a few days.	Wacebisa ukuba ahlale apha iintsuku ezimbalwa.
She had to say something to him.	Kwafuneka athethe into kuye.
You will be able to speak on your own.	Uya kukwazi ukuthetha wedwa.
I can't see, still.	Andiboni, nangoku.
Or it could be earlier now.	Okanye inokuba ngaphambili ngoku.
He could not help but leave.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba ukuba ahambe.
He opened it and looked at her.	Wavula wajonga kuye.
I hope that happens soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kwenzeka kungekudala.
It is not easy to find the right person in bed.	Akukho lula ukufumana umntu olungileyo ebhedini.
And it is going to be very difficult.	Kwaye sele kuza kuba nzima kakhulu.
If this really happened.	Ukuba oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
That would mean a lot.	Oko bekuya kuthetha kakhulu.
It would have been better if I had gone completely.	Bekuya kuba ngcono ukuba ndihambe ngokupheleleyo.
It is difficult to remain positive all the time.	Kunzima ukuhlala unethemba ngalo lonke ixesha.
Maybe the car is a very good thing.	Mhlawumbi imoto yinto entle kakhulu.
He shouldn't have got into it.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba angene kuyo.
This is my whole thing and everything.	Le yinto yam yonke kunye nayo yonke into.
We know it well.	Siyazi kakuhle.
Absolutely impossible, really.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka, ngokwenene.
So, you drive a little bit.	Ke ngoko, uqhuba kancinci.
And you and him.	Kwaye wena kunye naye.
I wanted to say that.	Bendifuna ukuyithetha lonto.
Where he went.	Apho waya khona.
Everyone told me.	Wonke umntu wandixelela.
I, yes, there I am.	Ke, ewe, nantso ke.
Being able to be.	Ukwazi kuba.
You can definitely do it at home.	Ungayenza ngokuqinisekileyo ekhaya.
He took the book and handed it to me.	Wathatha incwadi wandinika.
Then he started working.	Waza waqalisa ukusebenza.
To think that it will be so and we all know that it will be so.	Ukucinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo kwaye sonke siyazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
She had to go to him for everything.	Kwafuneka aye kuye ngayo yonke into.
He thinks he will stay here all the time.	Ucinga ukuba uya kuhlala elapha ngalo lonke ixesha.
And he went on with her.	Waza waqhubeka naye.
Don't be sad anymore.	Musa ukuba buhlungu kwakhona.
You are tired and want to get out of town.	Udiniwe kwaye ufuna ukuphuma edolophini.
He is very tired.	Udiniwe kakhulu.
He says it's okay.	Uthi kulungile.
It's just, well.	Yinto nje, kakuhle.
No one thinks it is true.	Akukho mntu ucinga ukuba yinyani.
There is something wrong with him.	Kukho into kuye.
Not entirely, though.	Akunjalo ngokupheleleyo, nangona kunjalo.
Some way to make your way.	Indlela ethile yokwenza indlela yakho.
He lives, he lives.	Uhlala, uhlala.
I don't know if you know.	Andazi noba uyazi na.
He agreed and left.	Wavuma wahamba.
But not fast enough.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Not just me but him too.	Hayi nam kuphela kodwa naye.
You can not have other people marry her.	Awukwazi ukuba abanye abantu umtshato wakhe.
No one has promised to do that before.	Akukho mntu wakha wathembisa ukwenza loo nto ngaphambili.
Maybe one.	Mhlawumbi enye.
You can have him at that moment.	Usenokuba naye ngelo xesha kanye.
How much better you can be.	Unokuba ngcono kangakanani.
I am new.	Ndim omtsha lo.
And it's a job.	Kwaye ngumsebenzi.
I didn't see anything else after that.	Andizange ndibone enye into emva koko.
About my friends.	Malunga nabahlobo bam.
Please do so again.	Nceda wenze njalo kwakhona.
It will be sooner rather than later.	Kuya kuba kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
I can't say much.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu.
But he did a few things.	Kodwa wenza izinto ezimbalwa.
You want a name.	Ufuna igama.
It will be more difficult after that.	Kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi emva koko.
He sat down and looked at her.	Wahlala phantsi wajonga kuye.
I feel bad for him.	Ndiziva kakubi ngaye.
Or maybe I don’t care.	Okanye mhlawumbi andikhathali.
I've said all this.	Ndithethe yonke le nto.
Well, maybe not exactly.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo ncam.
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
I’m not entirely up to everyone though.	Andikho ngokupheleleyo kuye wonke umntu nangona kunjalo.
You have to go to work tomorrow.	Kufuneka uye emsebenzini ngomso.
Two days, of course.	Iintsuku ezimbini, kunjalo.
Immediately.	Kwangoko.
Where are you? 	Uphi?
I feel that way in the morning.	Ndiziva ngolo hlobo kusasa.
You just go with it.	Uhamba nje ngayo.
There is one there for you.	Kukho enye apho kuwe.
I feel like you feel it today.	Ndiziva ngathi uziva namhlanje.
I just want time alone.	Ndifuna nje ixesha ndedwa.
There is something really wrong.	Kukho into engalunganga ngenene.
Just doing the job.	Ukwenza nje umsebenzi.
But whatever! 	Kodwa nantoni na!
Then you learn that it will be so.	Emva koko ufunda ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He didn’t eat, though.	Akazange atye, nangona kunjalo.
There is a restaurant.	Kukho indawo yokutyela.
And what a beautiful place to be.	Kwaye yeyiphi indawo entle kuyo.
When he appears, he is really scared.	Xa ebonakala, uyoyika ngokwenene.
I'm tired all the time.	Ndidiniwe ngalo lonke ixesha.
However, he is fine now.	Nangona kunjalo, ulungile ngoku.
There was no one in his class.	Kwakungekho mntu eklasini yakhe.
But, you know, it's possible.	Kodwa, uyazi, kunokwenzeka.
And he admitted this.	Uye wavuma oku.
I know first.	Ndiyazi kuqala.
I think about it.	Ndikhe ndicinge ngayo.
Then we will have to go through all this again.	Emva koko kuya kufuneka sihambe kuyo yonke le nto kwakhona.
Why did that happen?	Kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oko.
But here he is, intelligent.	Kodwa lo ulapha, ukrelekrele.
It has to be this.	Kufuneka kube oku.
Going to the park.	Ukuya epakini.
Yesterday, if possible.	Izolo, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
It might have gone the other way.	Inokuba uhambe ngenye indlela.
In improving.	Ekwenzeni ngcono.
So he came.	Ngoko weza.
Just thinking.	Ukucinga nje.
But he did not want to know.	Kodwa ke wayengafuni ukwazi.
I could not stay away.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala kude.
He went everywhere.	Wangena kuyo yonke indawo.
I can't read his mind about it.	Andikwazi ukufunda ingqondo yakhe ngaloo nto.
But this will be everything today.	Kodwa oku kuya kuba yinto yonke namhlanje.
Just at the same time.	Kanye ngexesha elinye.
But you can't find the problem.	Kodwa awukwazi ukufumana ingxaki.
This is about that.	Oku malunga naloo nto.
Then there is the problem.	Emva koko kukho ingxaki.
You better tell her.	Kungcono umxelele.
He is coming here soon.	Uza apha ngokukhawuleza.
Let me repeat why.	Makhe ndiphinde ndiphinde ukuba kutheni.
He didn't want that anymore.	Wayengafuni oko kwakhona.
He didn't really want to know.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
So there's a lot out there.	Ngoko kukho okuninzi apho.
You know that's not the way we do it.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo indlela esenza ngayo.
I'm happy for him.	Ndiyavuya ngenxa yakhe.
He could quickly do this, then.	Angayenza ngokukhawuleza oku, ngoko.
And there is a woman.	Kwaye kukho umfazi.
My money is fine.	Imali yam ilungile.
He never came.	Zange afike.
He wanted to stay no.	Wayefuna ukuhlala hayi.
He just walked away.	Uye wahamba nje.
I always think about that.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngaloo nto.
He never was and never will be.	Akazange kwaye akanjalo.
And for many years.	Kwaye iminyaka emininzi.
We all want to say it.	Sonke sifuna ukuyithetha.
He may not be.	Usenokuba akanjalo.
Or not so much, of course.	Okanye hayi kakhulu, kunjalo.
The answer is no.	Impendulo kukuba akakwazi.
Stop doing everything right away.	Yeka ukwenza konke ngoko nangoko.
No, he thought.	Akunjalo, wayecinga.
Or to any of us.	Okanye kuye nabani na kuthi.
He is the one who left.	Nguye wahamba.
I do not like this book.	Andiyithandi le ncwadi.
You are doing really well.	Uqhuba kakuhle ngenene.
But now she is OK.	Kodwa ngoku ulungile.
Look at a few.	Jonga ezimbalwa.
Obviously, you do not know either.	Ngokucacileyo, nawe awuyazi.
It would be so.	Bekuya kuba njalo .
He died that afternoon.	Wafa ngaloo mvakwemini.
There is a problem enough.	Kukho ingxaki ngokwaneleyo.
He said that was a big deal.	Wathi yinto enkulu leyo.
We need to have him.	Kufuneka sibe naye.
I thought about that question.	Ndacinga ngalo mbuzo.
But he talked a lot.	Kodwa wathetha kakhulu.
He could not finish things.	Akazange akwazi ukugqiba izinto.
And he does this.	Kwaye uyayenza le nto .
asked another.	wabuza omnye.
Not out there.	Akukho ngaphandle apho.
You don't know that.	Awuyazi loo nto.
Have you come here.	Ngaba uze apha.
He would be late.	Wayeza kuba late.
I do not know how or why.	Andazi ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
If you are determined, that's it.	Ukuba uzimisele, yiloo nto.
I want you there.	Ndifuna wena apho.
In any age, for that matter.	Kuyo nayiphi na iminyaka, ngaloo nto.
Not tonight, please.	Hayi ngokuhlwanje, nceda.
I really hope you will do this again.	Ndiyathemba ngokwenene ukuba uya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
That's why he loves music.	Yiyo loo nto uthanda umculo.
He cannot wait until tomorrow.	Akakwazi kulinda kude kube ngomso.
Moreover, she made a lot of money.	Ngaphezu koko, wafumana imali eninzi.
For immediately.	Kuba ngoko nangoko.
But not at night.	Kodwa hayi ebusuku.
Now, today.	Ngoku, namhlanje.
I can't be there.	Andikwazi ukuba lapho.
You are so much better than me.	Ungcono kakhulu ngaphandle kwam.
And now this way.	Kwaye ngoku ngale ndlela.
It would be nice though.	Kuya kuba kuhle nangona kunjalo.
He asked another question.	Wabuza omnye umbuzo.
And not just a piano, though.	Kwaye hayi ipiyano nje, nokuba.
He wants to talk to her.	Ufuna ukuthetha naye.
I have never been alone.	Andizange ndibe ndedwa.
I want to have children with you.	Ndifuna ukuba nabantwana nawe.
And he never left.	Kwaye akazange aphinde ahambe.
There is life.	Kukho ubomi.
However, he did.	Nangona kunjalo, uyenzile.
There is truth in it.	Kukho inyaniso kuyo.
Very good work here.	Umsebenzi omhle kakhulu apha.
But we will both continue.	Kodwa siza kuqhubeka sobabini.
Your father, your mother.	Utata wakho, umama wakho.
However, this did not happen.	Kodwa ke, oku akuzange kube njalo.
He knew he was coming, eventually.	Wayesazi ukuba uya kuza, ekugqibeleni.
We need to go faster anyway.	Kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza kunjalo.
And yes, that is possible, but it is not possible.	Kwaye ewe, oko kunokwenzeka, kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
That will only get better.	Oko kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
He said he should.	Wathi kufuneka.
And of course, you don't have to be here.	Kwaye kunjalo, akufuneki ube lapha.
Nothing more than friends.	Akukho nto ngaphezu abahlobo.
We all know about it.	Sonke siyazi ngayo.
So this is going to happen.	Ngoko ke oku kuya kwenzeka.
Or somewhere there.	Okanye kwindawo apho.
I want to be your husband.	Ndifuna ukuba yindoda yakho.
So I hesitate to think too much.	Ngoko ke ndiyathandabuza ukucinga kakhulu.
Thank you so much for such a wonderful job.	Enkosi kakhulu ngomsebenzi omhle kangaka.
I'm always here.	Ndihlala ndilapha.
I have to go there.	Kufuneka ndiye apho.
You are absolutely afraid of things.	Uyoyika ngokupheleleyo izinto.
You must arrive early.	Kufuneka ufike kwangethuba.
Then it was.	Emva koko kube njalo.
What's your problem, they say.	Yintoni ingxaki yakho, bathi.
And now there is this phone.	Kwaye ngoku kukho le ifowuni.
How long ago that seemed.	Kudala kangakanani oko kwakubonakala.
Work is work.	Umsebenzi ngumsebenzi.
He too knew nothing.	Naye wayengazi nto.
I know my son.	Ndiyamazi unyana wam.
Not for you, of course.	Hayi kuwe, kunjalo.
I didn't know about it, at first.	Ndandingazi ngayo, ekuqaleni.
You will have to do it.	Kuza kufuneka uyenze.
You only need one.	Ufuna enye kuphela.
He wanted to die right then and there.	Wayefuna ukufa kanye ngelo xesha.
That would be really fun !.	Oko kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene!.
Intelligent but not too much.	Ukrelekrele kodwa hayi kakhulu.
It will go every day.	Iza kuhamba yonke imihla.
The one who comes to me, yes.	Lowo uza kum, ewe.
I wonder about all that.	Ndiyazibuza ngayo yonke loo nto.
He did the same thing next to her.	Wenza into efanayo ecaleni kwakhe.
I told you about it.	Ndikuxelele ngayo.
Everyone is out.	Wonke umntu uye waphuma.
Do nothing at all if you do not want to.	Musa ukwenza nto konke konke ukuba awufuni.
If yes, that's fine.	Ukuba ewe, kulungile.
You know, before you.	Uyazi, ngaphambi kokuba ube .
You know that's my toy.	Uyazi ukuba yinto yam yokudlala leyo.
But he did what he could.	Kodwa wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
He is my best friend.	Ngumhlobo wam nyani.
Now, of course, you have to wait.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, kufuneka ulinde.
You don't want that either.	Nawe awufuni loo nto.
He did not want anyone to go with him.	Wayengafuni mntu ahambe naye.
He did not think.	Khange acinge.
He felt the same way with her.	Waziva ngolo hlobo naye.
There was no one in the car when he did.	Kwakungekho mntu emotweni xa esenza.
And everyone knows you do things.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyazi ukuba wenza izinto.
I mean big.	Ndithetha enkulu.
I wanted to.	Ndandifuna .
There is a reunion.	Kukho ukudibana kwakhona.
I don't care, really.	Andikhathali, ngenene.
Even if it is possible.	Nokuba kunokwenzeka.
All right, it's better.	Kulungile, kungcono.
Not from the hospital.	Hayi ukusukela esibhedlele.
A little angry again.	Ukuba nomsindo kancinci kwakhona.
He wanted his mother.	Wayefuna umama wakhe.
But we will do it now.	Kodwa siza kuyenza ngoku.
That's all better.	Yiyo yonke into engcono.
He never told her that.	Akazange amxelele loo nto.
I feel tired now.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe ngoku.
I really wanted to achieve this.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukuphumelela oku.
Yes, it was not difficult.	Ewe, kwakungekho nzima.
If you like it, it's good for you.	Ukuba uyayithanda, kulungile kuwe.
And we will go to lunch.	Kwaye siza kuya kwisidlo sasemini.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
But, we will not have all the answer.	Kodwa, asiyi kuba nayo yonke impendulo.
And now it's so good.	Kwaye ngoku kuhle kakhulu.
For what, he did not know exactly.	Kuba yintoni, wayengazi ncam.
So you are sure about him here.	Ngoko ke uqinisekile ngaye apha.
He was about to leave.	Wayesele eza kuhamba.
He is scared, but he knows what to do.	Uyoyika, kodwa uyayazi into amakayenze.
Well, he knew he was coming.	Ewe, wayesazi ukuba uza kuza.
Nice bedroom.	Igumbi lokulala elihle.
He seems to be coming back.	Ubonakala sele eza kubuya.
It only happens in the evening.	Kwenzeka ngokuhlwa kuphela.
Yes, as it is.	Ewe, njengoko kunjalo.
I'm just sorry you were together.	Ndiyaxolisa nje ngokuba ube kunye.
He can never get home without his help.	Akanakuze afike ekhaya ngaphandle koncedo lwakhe.
He ran all the way.	Wabaleka indlela yonke.
I'm sure there was nothing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kwakungekho nto.
I can't think of a word.	Andikwazi ukucinga igama.
There is a good chance that this will happen.	Kukho ithuba elihle lokuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
To do this, but not.	Ukwenza oku, kodwa hayi.
I will go alone.	Ndiya kuhamba ndedwa.
I will try this.	Ndiza kuzama le.
If you have, you will be running this.	Ukuba unayo, uya kube uqhuba le.
John spoke first.	UYohane wathetha kuqala.
No one should do this alone.	Akukho mntu kufuneka ayenze yedwa le nto.
He knew he was going to do it.	Wayesazi ukuba wayeza kuyenza loo nto.
And there is a reason to go.	Kwaye kukho isizathu sokuba uhambe.
But of course, yes.	Kodwa kunjalo, ewe.
One day soon.	Ngenye imini kungekudala.
There are a few things at work.	Kukho izinto ezimbalwa emsebenzini.
I did not want it to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke.
And they all live here.	Kwaye bonke bahlala apha.
Yes to all this.	Ewe kuyo yonke le nto.
Well, not everyone, obviously.	Ewe, ayinguye wonke umntu, ngokucacileyo.
So it takes a long time.	Ngoko kuthatha ixesha elide.
Then he needs to know what to do with everything.	Emva koko kufuneka azi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo yonke into.
Or something worse.	Okanye into embi ngakumbi.
Now, your car is ready.	Ngoku, imoto yakho ilungile.
Nice word, by the way.	Ilizwi elihle, ngendlela.
You want to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba wedwa.
And all that.	Kwaye yonke loo nto.
But look up.	Kodwa jonga phezulu.
Nothing to him or anything.	Akukho nto kuye okanye nantoni na.
He needed advice.	Wayefuna icebiso.
Then look away.	Emva koko ujonge ecaleni.
Nice restaurant.	Indawo yokutyela entle.
Everyone ran ahead.	Wonke umntu wabaleka ukuya phambili.
And he says sorry.	Kwaye uthi uxolo.
Otherwise, it will not be for you.	Ngaphandle koko, akuyi kuba kuwe.
But he says, no.	Kodwa uthi, hayi.
You have to wait, yes yes.	Kufuneka ulinde, ewe ewe.
I just wanted him to come into the house.	Bendifuna nje angene endlini.
And that's him.	Kwaye nguye lowo.
Intelligence is fine.	Ukrelekrele kulungile.
He got one, though.	Wafumana enye, nangona kunjalo.
For in the end, he has to succeed.	Kuba ekugqibeleni, kufuneka aphumelele.
It's the same thing.	Yinto efanayo.
Maybe you tried to do more quickly.	Mhlawumbi wazama ukwenza okuninzi ngokukhawuleza.
Soon he did not know if anything.	Kungekudala wayengazi ukuba kukho nantoni na.
I never thought it would all last so long.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yonke le nto iza kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga mna.
You must be scared of him too.	Umele ukuba uyoyika naye.
But why wait until then ?.	Kodwa kutheni ulinde kude kube ngoko?.
He should not do this.	Akufunekanga ayenze le nto.
He's out a little bit.	Ulapha phandle kancinci.
I don't care obviously.	Andikhathali kucacile.
Everyone stays.	Wonke umntu uhlala.
Now you are almost done.	Ngoku sele uphantse ukugqiba.
But we all have to do it together.	Kodwa sonke kufuneka siyenze kunye.
Yeah, enough for now.	Ewe, ngokwaneleyo okwangoku.
But don't be like that.	Kodwa musa ukuba njalo.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
He never wanted to talk to her again.	Akazange afune ukuthetha naye kwakhona.
He looked at the bike.	Wajonga ibhayisekile.
I will definitely do this again !!!.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona le nto !!!.
A new woman every night.	Umfazi omtsha rhoqo ebusuku.
It will not be difficult for him.	Asiyi kuba nzima kuye.
What happened to everyone.	Kwenzeke ntoni wonke umntu.
Although it seems possible.	Nangona kubonakala ngathi kunokwenzeka.
And you don't want to do too much.	Kwaye awufuni ukwenza okuninzi.
And he did very well.	Kwaye wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
So, there was not much way there.	Ngoko, kwakungekho ndlela ingako apho.
I think this means that something really good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuthetha ukuba kukho into entle ngokwenene.
Maybe he would be hard.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuba nzima.
It doesn’t have to be hard or painful, though.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube nzima okanye kube buhlungu, nangona kunjalo.
I hope they will be.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kuba.
It should be now and here.	Kumele kube ngoku kwaye apha.
And in the end you can't stop.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni awukwazi ukuyeka.
I'm starting to say that.	Ndiyaqala ukuyithetha lonto.
Maybe days.	Mhlawumbi iintsuku.
None of us.	Akukho ndawo yethu.
Maybe he will do it himself later.	Mhlawumbi uya kuyenza ngokwakhe kamva.
Moreover he did not want to know.	Ngaphezu koko wayengafuni ukwazi.
And there is nothing better for you.	Kwaye akukho ngcono kuwe.
What do you think.	Ucinga NTONI.
You want to make a big picture.	Ufuna ukwenza umfanekiso omkhulu.
Although, nothing new.	Nangona, akukho nto entsha.
He did not know what would happen next.	Wayengazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
He certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wamxelela.
I hope that comes soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kuza ngokukhawuleza.
There is only a week or so until then.	Kukho iveki kuphela okanye kunjalo kude kube ngoko.
For years.	Kuba iminyaka.
As he spoke, that is exactly what happened.	Njengoko ethetha, oko kwenzeka kanye.
He told me he was here.	Wandixelela ukuba ulapha.
Then in the morning.	Emva koko kusasa.
He really was not there at the time.	Ngokwenene wayengekho ngelo xesha .
You can be a doctor.	Usenokuba ngugqirha.
You don't want to go there.	Awufuni ukuya apho.
Or a little better.	Okanye kancinci ngcono.
I just wanted to get better.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba ngcono.
Moreover, it is not exactly.	Ngaphezu koko, akukho ncam.
My wife, too.	Umfazi wam, naye.
Well almost everything.	Kulungile phantse yonke into.
It happens all the time now and again.	Kwenzeka rhoqo ngoku kwaye kwakhona.
I have had to make peace with everything.	Kuye kwafuneka ndenze uxolo nayo yonke into.
You are not visible to me.	Awubonakali kum.
Everyone, except you.	Wonke umntu, ngaphandle kwakho.
I know for a fact that it is not.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba akunjalo.
This, of course, will happen.	Oku, ngokwenene, kuya kwenzeka.
I am so happy about this !.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ngale nto!.
He wanted to be me.	Wayefuna ukuba ndim.
Please stay with us.	Ndicela uhlale nathi.
No one will come after you.	Akukho mntu uya kuza emva kwakho.
He had to, to get home.	Kwafuneka, ukuze afike ekhaya.
And he looked at her.	Waza wajonga kuye.
Not so much but no problem.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa akukho ngxaki.
No one eats anything.	Akukho mntu utya nantoni na.
So, to you at home.	Ngoko, kuwe ekhaya.
He said he wanted to die.	Wathi ufuna ukufa.
However there is another fact.	Nangona kunjalo kukho enye inyaniso.
I just want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi kuphela.
Expect to work well.	Ulindele ukusebenza kakuhle.
And yes, it is his friend.	Kwaye ewe, ngumhlobo wakhe.
I had to talk to him a little bit.	Kwafuneka ndithethe nam kancinci.
He thought he was optimistic.	Wacinga ukuba wayenethemba.
He walks over to her.	Uhamba uye kuye.
Every mother walked away from me.	Wahamba wonke umama kum.
He's interested here, he thought.	Unomdla apha, wacinga.
A little here.	Kancinci apha.
That's what makes you a man.	Yiloo nto ekwenza ube yindoda.
He decided who he would stay with.	Wagqiba ekubeni ngubani oza kuhlala naye.
You will get better.	Uzakuba ngcono.
There was no danger for him, here.	Kwakungekho ngozi kuye, apha.
His speech is empty.	Ukuthetha kwakhe akukho nto.
He knew he would be there.	Wayesazi ukuba uya kuba lapho.
Dad made his decision.	Utata wenza isigqibo sakhe.
I don't have to tell you.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndikuxelele.
I think that would be great for us.	Ndicinga ukuba oko bekuya kuba kuhle ngathi.
But we will be better off sooner or later.	Kodwa siza kuba ngcono kuye kungekudala okanye kamva.
I did not hear or hear anything.	Khange ndive okanye ndive nto.
This is not really necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko ngokwenene.
You feel everything, all the time, whatever it is.	Uziva yonke into, lonke ixesha, nokuba yintoni na.
I never thought of where I was going at first.	Andizange ndicinge apho ndiya khona ekuqaleni.
He likes to get in there.	Uthanda ukuba angene apho.
No one will ever come.	Akukho namnye uya kuze eze.
He can walk.	Uyakwazi ukuhamba.
I thought this would be great.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba kuhle.
That's fine, but that's it.	Oko kulungile, kodwa yiloo nto.
He came looking for work.	Wafika efuna umsebenzi.
Inside the house.	Ngaphakathi endlini.
In the end they said it was okay.	Ekugqibeleni bathi kulungile.
No, no help.	Hayi, hayi uncedo.
Things, however, are definitely things.	Izinto, nangona kunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo izinto.
We know they will get coffee.	Siyazi ukuba baya kufumana ikofu.
I heard it here from me.	Ndive apha kum .
Obviously, if anything.	Ngokucacileyo, ukuba kukho nantoni na.
You will see more of that later.	Uya kubona ngakumbi oko kamva.
You never thought about it.	Awuzange ucinge ngayo.
Probably everyone is like that.	Mhlawumbi wonke umntu unjalo.
So he said.	Ngoko ke wathi.
But you read it hard.	Kodwa ufunda nzima.
If you think so.	Ukuba ucinga njalo .
I make coffee at home.	Ndenza ikofu ekhaya.
You will see a lot as you walk through the park.	Uya kubona kakhulu njengoko uhamba epakini.
It would be soon now.	Bekuya kuba kungekudala ngoku.
I did it recently.	Ndiyenzile mva nje.
Definitely okay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kulungile.
She thinks she loves him.	Ucinga ukuba uyamthanda.
I'm not sure this will work out.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba oku kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
He wanted her to be in front of him.	Wayefuna ukuba abe phambi kwakhe.
But yes, he is here.	Kodwa ewe, ulapha.
I looked out, away from me.	Ndijonge ngaphandle, kude kum.
But only if you are sure you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba uqinisekile ukuba uyafuna.
This is already evident.	Oku sele kubonakala.
Probably never happened.	Mhlawumbi ayizange yenzeke.
I'm so sorry too.	Nam ndiyaxolisa kakhulu.
Not so here.	Akunjalo ke apha.
Yes, a big problem.	Ewe, ingxaki enkulu.
I never thought of another one.	Andizange ndicinge ngenye.
But not too high.	Kodwa hayi phezulu kakhulu.
You will need to think fast.	Kuya kufuneka ucinge ngokukhawuleza.
You are right .	Ulungile .
Finally, he got out of bed.	Ekugqibeleni, wehla ebhedini.
But perhaps they did not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi abazange.
Is my life.	Ngaba ubomi bam.
We have done all this.	Senze konke oku.
Now it looks good.	Ngoku kubonakala kulungile.
He refused to leave.	Akazange avume ukuba ahambe.
But he wanted to go now.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuhamba ngoku.
Yes, yes, and no.	Ewe, ewe, kwaye hayi.
I'll take this .	Ndiza kuthatha oku .
I do not believe so.	Andikholelwa ukuba kunjalo apha.
To you and him, alone.	Kuwe kunye naye, yedwa.
That's why you play music.	Yiyo loo nto udlala umculo.
There is something wrong with me.	Kukho into engalunganga kum.
He said there was no way, no.	Wathi akukho ndlela, akunjalo.
Death is very difficult.	Ukufa kunzima kakhulu.
So, no thank you.	Ngoko, hayi enkosi.
No he doesn't want another dad.	Hayi akafuni omnye utata.
All right, go.	Kulungile, uhambe.
He conducts music.	Uqhuba umculo.
So this is the only one.	Ngoko ke le kuphela.
I thought it was a big deal.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto enkulu.
I would like to do it the right way.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza ngendlela elungileyo.
Traveling can be all right.	Ukuhamba kunokuba konke kulungile.
No, not with money.	Hayi, hayi ngemali.
In the end, you will succeed.	Ekugqibeleni, uya kuphumelela.
It doesn't seem to be going up.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho phezulu.
It's just a job.	Ngumsebenzi kuphela.
I want you to succeed.	Ndifuna ukuba uphumelele.
I'm trying to get you to leave.	Ndizama ukuba uhambe.
It would take a lifetime to do so.	Bekuya kuthatha ubomi bonke ukwenjenjalo.
You are wasting your time here.	Udlala ngexesha lakho apha.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela umntu ekufuneka uyazi.
You can't make it right.	Awukwazi ukuyenza ilungile.
They went to my house.	Baye endlini yam.
True, for once.	Inyaniso, kube kanye.
Not at first though.	Hayi ekuqaleni kodwa.
That's just fine.	Oko kulungile kuphela.
Then, you can do it again.	Emva koko, ungayenza kwakhona.
And then, the woman didn't know.	Kwaye emva koko, umfazi akazange akwazi.
He knew more about her now.	Wayesazi ngakumbi ngaye ngoku.
A place like this.	Indawo enje.
Then he came with her.	Emva koko weza naye.
It's just that he wants to talk to you.	Kuphela kukuba ufuna ukuthetha nawe.
But you do not have to stay.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhlale.
You have done a tremendous job.	Wenze umsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu.
And he is very good.	Kwaye ulungile kakhulu.
There is no need or reason.	Akukho mfuneko okanye isizathu.
Definitely not fun.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mnandi.
I just went for it.	Ndaya nje kuba.
He sat for a while and walked out.	Wahlala kancinci waphuma.
Or anytime.	Okanye nanini na.
I want to do something with my kids.	Ndifuna ukwenza into nabantwana bam.
If you have ever felt it, you know.	Ukuba uye waziva, uyazi.
It's a big deal that.	Yinto enkulu ukuba.
A woman is everything.	Umfazi yinto yonke.
Then my parents.	Emva koko abazali bam.
Immediately, if you wish.	Ngoko nangoko, ukuba uyafuna.
word.	ilizwi.
He speaks really well.	Uthetha kakuhle ngenene.
He was just telling the truth.	Wayethetha nje inyani.
I don't see anything at first.	Andiboni nto ekuqaleni.
Day, night, anytime.	Imini, ubusuku, nanini na.
At first, this will take time.	Ekuqaleni, oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
And that's the worst thing.	Kwaye yiloo nto embi kakhulu.
You talk for a long time.	Uthetha ixesha elide.
I do it slowly.	Ndiyenza kancinci.
All of this has happened to you.	Konke oku kwenzeke kuwe.
All great.	Yonke enkulu.
But that does not have to happen.	Kodwa oko akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke.
We deserve this.	Sifanele oku.
I will do anything, anything.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na, nantoni na .
Yeah, almost a big deal.	Ewe, phantse into enkulu.
I'm not sure you're human.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ungumntu.
And he will, just because he is here.	Kwaye uya kwenza, ngokuba nje apha.
No I don't know.	Hayi andazi.
Don't even say it's true.	Musa ukuyithetha nokuba yinyani.
A long time ago, though.	Kudala, nangona kunjalo.
He died later.	Wafa emva koko.
And not my daughter.	Kwaye hayi intombi yam.
He didn't have to tell me anything about it.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba andixelele nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Some say yes, some no.	Abanye bathi ewe, abanye hayi.
It is not just about us.	Akunjalo ngathi kuphela.
Then someone says something.	Emva koko umntu uthetha into.
I knew it, too.	Ndandisazi, nam.
A nice little book.	Incwadi encinci entle.
To say the least.	Ukuyithetha kancinci.
One good piece of advice.	Icebiso elihle elinye.
Because he has to do so.	Kuba kufuneka enjenjalo.
We do not have to guess.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze isigqibo.
At first, it seems too far away.	Ekuqaleni, kubonakala kude kakhulu.
He thought he was sleeping for three hours.	Wacinga ukuba ulele iiyure ezintathu.
Very big woman.	Umfazi omkhulu kakhulu.
It certainly won't be fun.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kuba mnandi.
He never did.	Akazange aphinde.
He looked bad right away.	Wabonakala embi ngoko nangoko.
But just then, there it is.	Kodwa kanye ngelo xesha, nantso ke.
He wants to hurt someone.	Ufuna umntu athethe naye kakubi.
I'm very sorry.	Uxolo kakhulu.
You really did not know.	Ngenene awuzange wazi.
Not to the room, but to himself.	Hayi ukuya egumbini, kodwa kuye ngokwakhe.
I will not do such a thing here.	Andiyi kwenza into enjalo apha.
This will not happen soon.	Oku akunakwenzeka kungekudala.
I wanted to do it too.	Nam ndandifuna ukuyenza.
The one that got away.	Lo wabaleka.
I mean, look at your life.	Ndithetha, jonga ubomi bakho.
I wanted money then.	Ndandifuna imali ngoko.
No help.	Hayi uncedo.
But he was afraid, too.	Kodwa wayesoyika, naye.
And you, that's fine.	Ke wena, kulungile.
That's how he made his money.	Wayenza ngaloo ndlela imali yakhe.
Later.	Emva kwexesha.
Thinking about money.	Ukucinga ngemali.
And maybe he would.	Kwaye mhlawumbi wayeza.
But it seems to be coming soon.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kuza kungekudala.
By this time, he knew everything about her.	Ngeli xesha, wayesazi yonke into ngaye.
Or you can't.	Okanye awukwazi.
What a name.	Yintoni igama.
And a place next to me in a restaurant.	Kwaye indawo ecaleni kwam kwindawo yokutyela.
During this time, he knew many things.	Ngeli xesha, wayesazi izinto ezininzi.
We need to do that ourselves.	Kufuneka senze oko nathi ngokwethu.
So how can I do it.	Ngoko ndingayenza njani.
What happened and what will happen.	Kwenzeke ntoni kwaye kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Look at everyone.	Jonga wonke umntu.
You just have to know where you are looking.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi apho ujonge khona.
I know what happened to me.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo kum.
More to come soon !.	Okuninzi kuza kungekudala!.
Here it is, everywhere.	Apha apho, yonke indawo.
He was not at all.	Wayengekho tu.
I really made this question.	Ngenene ndiyenzile lo mbuzo.
Not the person he lives with.	Hayi umntu ahlala naye.
I think there is no danger in it.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho ngozi kuyo.
I need to know what happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Do not make it difficult.	Musa ukuyenza nzima.
Looks like you've logged in.	Kubonakala ngathi uye wangena.
I never heard from him again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndive kuye.
One small problem, however.	Ingxaki enye encinci, nangona kunjalo.
It's hard enough for that to happen.	Kunzima ngokwaneleyo ukuba oko kwenzeke.
And he wanted to go.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuhamba.
You know this thing better than I do.	Uyayazi le nto ngcono kunam.
So the doctor went.	Wahamba ke ugqirha.
She looks back.	Ujonge ngasemva.
Well, no one ever told me.	Ewe, akukho mntu wakha wandixelela.
Well, everything.	Kulungile, yonke into.
So, no.	Ngoko ke, akukho.
But you can't do it.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuyenza.
That is not the way we do things.	Akunjalo indlela esenza ngayo izinto.
I didn't want to go either.	Nam ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
But it's all too good to be true, of course.	Kodwa konke kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani, kunjalo.
I want this.	Ndifuna le.
But, this.	Kodwa, oku.
Others will succeed.	Abanye baya kuphumelela.
Not entirely, of course.	Akunjalo ngokupheleleyo, kunjalo.
Certainly not this one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo lo akazange.
My wife said no.	Umfazi wam wathi hayi.
It will be good for you, you will see.	Kuya kuba kuhle kuwe, uya kubona.
We will certainly need help.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kufuna uncedo.
He didn't want anything of his own.	Wayengafuni kwanto yakhe.
That way you will have to come.	Ngaloo ndlela kuya kufuneka uze.
Very good, probably.	Kuhle kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
Working on it though.	Ukusebenza kuyo nangona kunjalo.
He did not even know that he could walk.	Wayengazi nokuba uyakwazi ukuhamba.
But it will be difficult for you.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima kuwe.
In his beautiful place, there were no problems.	Kwindawo yakhe entle, kwakungekho ngxaki.
Maybe he went inside to look for something else.	Mhlawumbi wangena ngaphakathi efuna enye into.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
But something unusual is happening here.	Kodwa kukho into engaqhelekanga eyenzekayo apha.
Just stop doing it.	Yeka nje ukuyenza.
I just wanted time.	Ndandifuna nje ixesha.
Yes, all of this is possible.	Ewe, konke oku kunokwenzeka.
You are in it.	Ukhona kuyo.
He does everything alone.	Yonke into uyenza yedwa.
You have been working on it for a long time now.	Kudala usebenza kuyo ngoku.
He walked forward.	Wahamba waya phambili.
He had to go there.	Kwafuneka aye apho.
And he didn't want to try.	Kwaye akazange afune ukuzama.
He did not eat breakfast in the morning.	Akazange atye isidlo sakusasa ekuseni.
But he did not speak immediately.	Kodwa akazange aphinde athethe ngoko nangoko.
In this you want other people.	Kule nto ufuna abanye abantu.
I need to talk to him now '.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoku'.
I was late for class.	Ndifike emva kwexesha eklasini.
And he will be the one again.	Kwaye uya kuba nguye kwakhona.
And it's all because of you.	Kwaye konke ngenxa yakho.
I did not want to become a doctor.	Ndandingafuni ukuba ngugqirha.
I need help from you too.	Ndifuna uncedo kuwe kwaye.
For the time being .	Ngeli xesha .
It will last for a few weeks.	Iza kuhlala iiveki ezimbalwa.
I looked at him but not at him.	Ndijonge kuye kodwa hayi kuye.
Maybe that could happen to me.	Mhlawumbi oko kunokwenzeka kum.
But why?	Kodwa kutheni?
I came here first.	Ndifike kuqala apha.
Also, very unusual.	Kwakhona, engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I just want to see.	Ndifuna nje ukubona.
Thanks again for everything !!.	Enkosi kwakhona ngayo yonke into!!.
And now he could not.	Kwaye ngoku akazange akwazi.
It happened just like that.	Kwenzeka kanye ngolo hlobo.
I did not want to come.	Ndandingafuni ukuza.
Finally, Dad opened his eyes.	Ekugqibeleni, utata wavula amehlo akhe.
You know how beautiful she is.	Uyazi ukuba mhle kangakanani na.
They will come to you, sooner rather than later.	Baza kuza kuwe, ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
And, to me, that's fine.	Kwaye, kum, oko kulungile.
Well not too much though.	Kulungile hayi kakhulu kunjalo.
Of course you do not have to think about it.	Ewe akuyomfuneko ukuba ucinge ngayo.
Only in this case, there is no danger.	Kuphela kule meko, akukho ngozi.
And now, immediately.	Kwaye ngoku, kwangoko.
Driving in this area takes time.	Ukuqhuba kule ndawo kuthatha ixesha.
I didn't know one.	Bendingayazi enye.
Yes, yes, yes and yes.	Ewe, ewe, ewe kwaye ewe.
Certainly not as it seems.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo njengoko kubonakala.
He saw through her once.	Wabona ngaye kanye.
I don’t understand why, though.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni, nangona kunjalo.
It is possible, but not impossible.	Kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I just wish.	Ndinqwenela nje .
Shortly thereafter, he received a daughter.	Kungekudala emva koko, wafumana intombi.
How are we going to do it.	Siza kwenza njani.
Maybe he knew then.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ngoko.
The question is what do you do with it.	Umbuzo kukuba wenza ntoni ngayo.
As he has to do.	Njengoko kufuneka enze.
I wanted a mother, yes.	Bendifuna umama, ewe.
I did not want to go with him.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba naye.
I can do this too.	Nam ndingayenza le nto.
However, you may be right.	Nangona kunjalo, unokuba ulungile.
He wanted meat.	Wayefuna inyama.
He hoped he would be able to.	Wayenethemba lokuba uya kukwazi.
I asked my mother to stay.	Ndacela umama ukuba ahlale.
I'm sure he'll be back, though.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uza kubuya, nangona kunjalo.
You never knew what it was like outside.	Awuzange wazi ukuba yintoni na ngaphandle.
Now you know everything.	Ngoku uyazi yonke into.
And playing at home.	Kwaye ukudlala ekhaya.
He just can't do it.	Akakwazi nje ukwenza.
But every morning.	Kodwa rhoqo kusasa.
It can be very difficult to walk.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu ukuhamba.
Good to know, though.	Kuhle ukwazi, nangona kunjalo.
He tried, but he could not succeed.	Wazama, kodwa akazange akwazi ukuphumelela.
So he knew everything about me.	Ngoko naye wayesazi yonke into ngam.
I have to be inside you.	Kufuneka ndibe ngaphakathi kuwe .
Now it's something.	Ngoku yinto ethile.
I can't make money.	Andikwazi ukufumana imali.
Nothing is made of it, of course.	Akukho nto yenziwe ngayo, kunjalo.
But he came.	Kodwa weza.
He wasn't, he thought.	Wayengekho, wacinga.
And there is no way.	Kwaye akukho ndlela.
That's what he wants to say.	Yiloo nto afuna ukuyithetha.
Anyone who has done a good job has done a good job.	Nabani na owenze umsebenzi wenze umsebenzi olungileyo.
Not your book.	Hayi incwadi yakho.
He doesn't want anything he wants.	Akafuni kwanto ayifunayo.
We just have to know.	Sifanele ukuba siyazi nje.
Well, something is coming.	Kulungile, kukho into ezayo.
Maybe that will happen here.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kwenzeka apha.
Everyone does it, every day.	Wonke umntu uyayenza, yonke imihla.
I make a small speech at work.	Ndenza intetho encinci emsebenzini.
I look forward to meeting him.	Ndijonge phambili ukudibana naye.
Only this time you know it.	Kuphela ngeli xesha uyazi oku.
That would be difficult to live with.	Oko bekuya kuba nzima ukuhlala naye.
We will wait for our turn.	Siza kulinda ithuba lethu.
He thought it was a big deal.	Wayecinga ukuba yinto enkulu.
Yes, one really knows.	Ewe, umntu uyazi ngokwenene.
I know now that this is not the case.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba oku akunjalo.
I don't like that approach.	Andiyithandi loo ndlela.
But that will not be the case.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba.
I just love this book.	Ndiyayithanda nje le ncwadi.
Before your time.	Ngaphambi kwexesha lakho.
But with him, really.	Kodwa kunye naye, ngokwenene.
This is best for you.	Oku kungcono kuwe.
But he often did so.	Kodwa wayedla ngokwenza njalo.
You're tired, you're tired, you're tired.	Udiniwe, udiniwe, udiniwe.
I'd love to go, but we'll see.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba, kodwa siza kubona.
It's none of my business.	Akukho nto yam.
I don't know if this is true.	Andazi ukuba yinyani na le.
I go there often.	Ndiya phaya rhoqo.
But everything else is the same.	Kodwa yonke into enye.
But he did not know what was happening to him.	Kodwa ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye akazange azi.
We want to make one.	Sifuna ukwenza enye.
Look what he gave me.	Jonga wandinika ntoni.
But everyone would go.	Kodwa wonke umntu wayeza kuhamba.
Next week or so.	Kwiveki ezayo okanye kunjalo.
We need to do something in place.	Kufuneka senze into ethile kwindawo.
She loves mom.	Uyamthanda umama.
Death, that.	Ukufa, oko.
The problem is he is not in the house tonight.	Ingxaki akakho endlini namhlanje ebusuku.
I'll start.	Ndiya kuqala.
Eventually he made his home.	Ekugqibeleni wayenza indawo yakhe yokuhlala.
Me too, it's hard to tell.	Nam, kunzima ukuxelela.
Another problem with this.	Enye ingxaki ngale nto.
I'm not sure what that might be.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba inokuba yintoni leyo.
I've done it all.	Ndiyenzile yonke.
That's fine, too.	Ilungile loo nto, nayo.
They will get there.	Baya kufika apho.
I would like that.	Ndingathanda ukuba.
You will see that very often.	Uya kubona oko kakhulu rhoqo.
Not down or up.	Hayi phantsi okanye phezulu.
You come here expecting something in return.	Uza apha ulindele into engekho.
I want so many things.	Ndifuna izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
It is strange to think about it.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ukucinga ngayo.
Sooner or later.	Ngoku okanye mva.
When he spoke his name.	Xa wayethetha igama lakhe.
I have nothing to tell him, he thought.	Akukho nto ndiza kumxelela yona, wacinga.
I do it again and again.	Ndiyenza kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
But there is only so much space up there.	Kodwa kukho indawo eninzi kuphela phezulu.
Thank you in advance.	Enkosi kwangethuba.
I to you, you to me.	Mna kuwe, wena kum.
You will win the case.	Uza kuphumelela ityala.
Everyone knows everyone here.	Wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu apha.
Look how good that is.	Jonga indlela entle ngayo loo nto.
I have to stay very long !.	Kufuneka ndihlale ixesha elide kakhulu!.
You're just talking about it.	Uthetha nje ngayo.
He sits next to her.	Uhlala ecaleni kwakhe.
It is not an old thing.	Asiyonto endala.
This we all know is not the case.	Oku sonke siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
And you should know that.	Kwaye ufanele ukwazi oko.
There is no place for him.	Akukho ndawo yakhe.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akazange.
Too play.	Ukudlala kakhulu.
And because he did, he did too.	Kwaye ngenxa yokuba wenza, naye wenza njalo.
That's right, though.	Kunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
He is the One who made it possible.	Nguye owenze ukuba kwenzeke.
Maybe you're good at it.	Mhlawumbi ulungile ngayo.
He goes to our house.	Uya endlini yethu.
You have to do very well.	Kufuneka wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
If so, you know more.	Ukuba kunjalo, wazi ngaphezu kwakho.
But where and when is the problem.	Kodwa iphi kwaye nini ingxaki.
I don't know which one yet.	Andazi ukuba yeyiphi okwangoku.
After that he did not speak to us for two days.	Emva koko akazange athethe nathi iintsuku ezimbini.
And the book is good.	Kwaye incwadi ilungile.
Don't just go up.	Musa nje ukuya phezulu.
But this one did.	Kodwa lo wenza.
Well, no, maybe.	Ewe, hayi, mhlawumbi.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andazi ncam ukuba yintoni na.
A little bit .	Kancinci .
No one ever gave me one.	Akukho mntu wakha wandinika enye.
Okay, but not too much.	Kulungile, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I'm here, too.	Ndilapha, nam.
She is sitting in the back of my car.	Uhleli ngasemva emotweni yam.
Soon, everyone was coming.	Kungekudala, wonke umntu wayeza.
She is sitting alone in the room.	Uhleli yedwa egumbini.
It should have been.	Bekufanele ukuba.
Then one did.	Emva koko omnye wenza.
If anyone knows about it.	Ukuba nabani na uyazi ngayo.
Getting there was not easy.	Ukuya apho kwakungekho lula.
One, then another.	Omnye, emva koko omnye.
You look here at me.	Ujonge apha kum.
Yes, my father later.	Ewe, utata wam kamva.
But it is difficult right now.	Kodwa kunzima okwangoku.
Make me naked.	Ndenze ndize.
But they will.	Kodwa baya kwenza.
I think we should, then.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka, ngoko.
He wanted to work.	Wayefuna ukusebenza.
He thought he didn't know what it was.	Wayecinga ukuba akayazi ukuba yintoni na.
I don't have to say.	Akufunekanga ndithethe.
But nobody goes to prison.	Kodwa akukho mntu uya entolongweni.
He opened it and looked inside.	Wavula wajonga ngaphakathi.
Or it could be a bad thing.	Okanye inokuba yinto embi.
He agreed as much as possible.	Wavuma kangangoko.
Fast, hard, right.	Ngokukhawuleza, kunzima, kulungile.
But he never appeared again.	Kodwa akazange aphinde abonakale.
I saw a picture of him recently.	Ndibone umfanekiso wakhe mva nje.
Not just money.	Hayi nje imali.
And you, you now.	Wena ke, wena ngoku.
I never learned anything.	Andizange ndifunde nto.
I thought again.	Bendicinga kwakhona.
Some have even gone to prison.	Abanye baye entolongweni.
She would like to talk to him about it.	Angathanda ukuthetha naye ngayo.
Then he went with me.	Emva koko wahamba nam.
But he is coming.	Kodwa lowo uza.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge .
But here, there was nothing.	Kodwa apha, kwakungekho nto.
When you want.	Xa ufuna.
So, it will happen.	Ngoko, kuya kwenzeka.
So I don't see anything.	Ngoko andiboni nto.
And three children.	Kwaye abantwana abathathu.
Now, however, it is not.	Ngoku, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
You have it very easy.	Unayo lula kakhulu.
Yes he wants her to go.	Ewe ufuna ukuba ahambe.
But again, you want to play.	Kodwa kwakhona, ufuna ukudlala.
You think you have money.	Ucinga ukuba unayo imali.
You think so much like that.	Ucinga kakhulu ngolo hlobo.
But he knew he didn't.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akazange.
He came up behind her and opened the door.	Ufike emva kwakhe wavula ucango.
He lives outside.	Uhlala phandle.
I love your way.	Ndiyayithanda indlela yakho.
I would love to know !.	Ndingathanda ukwazi!.
I can do it myself then.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza ngokwam ngoko.
Some, they say, will be easier.	Abanye, bathi, kuya kuba lula.
We will definitely live again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuhlala kwakhona.
Immediately, two things happened.	Ngoko nangoko, kwenzeka izinto ezimbini.
I know it takes time.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuthatha ixesha.
Like me now.	Njengam ngoku.
Finishing up.	Ukugqiba phezulu.
Don't stop.	Musa kwaphela.
He looked the way ahead of time.	Wajonga indlela phambi kwexesha.
This will be much easier.	Oku kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
He asked how he was feeling.	Wabuza ukuba uziva njani.
Now we know what it will look like.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba kuya kubonakala njani.
He continued the work.	Waqhubeka umsebenzi.
I really wanted to read that today.	Bendifuna ngokwenene ukufunda loo nto namhlanje.
No work, no.	Akukho msebenzi, akukho.
I don't know more yet.	Andazi ngakumbi okwangoku.
Not to mention him.	Hayi ukuthetha ngaye.
He wants to do something himself.	Ufuna ukwenza into ngokwakhe.
Taking his place.	Ukuthatha indawo yakhe.
When he came down.	Xa wehla .
I never thought about that much before.	Khange ndicinge kakhulu ngaloo nto ngaphambili.
If so, it's best to walk away.	Ukuba kunjalo, kulungile ukuba uhambe.
There is something in it.	Kukho into kuyo.
That's fine with me now.	Kulungile kum ngoku.
You are a person just like you.	Ungumntu njengawe.
Everyone is afraid of everything.	Wonke umntu woyika yonke into.
Nobody ever got in there.	Akukho mntu ukhe wangena apho.
We want it all.	Sifuna konke.
Don't say it.	Musa ukuyithetha .
He can walk well.	Uyakwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
And you never did a good job with that.	Kwaye awuzange wenze umsebenzi olungileyo ngaloo nto.
He wanted to play more.	Wayefuna ukudlala ngakumbi.
But I'm out here.	Kodwa ndilapha ngaphandle.
He has lived there.	Ukhe wahlala apho.
I'm sure he's very determined now.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uzimisele kakhulu ngoku.
It's okay to do.	Kulungile ukwenza.
And what happened back then.	Kwaye kwenzeka ntoni emva.
He is not, not really.	Akakho, hayi ngokwenene.
I want to get out of there.	Ndifuna ukuphuma apho.
Then he agreed.	Emva koko wavuma.
Please come now.	Nceda uze ngoku.
He certainly did a lot in it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wenza okuninzi kuyo.
He was not in prison.	Wayengekho entolongweni.
Well, that's what we're going to do.	Ke, yile nto siza kuyenza.
And it happened sooner than later.	Kwaye kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
Soon he would be able to get out of here.	Kungekudala wayeza kukwazi ukuphuma apha.
I have become my friend.	Ndibe ngumhlobo wam.
And you read this fast.	Kwaye ufunda oku ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe you only want two.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ezimbini kuphela.
But some did not.	Kodwa abanye abazange.
Only, he was not in his room.	Kuphela, wayengekho egumbini lakhe.
You do not have to do everything at once.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze yonke into ngexesha elinye.
I have helped many people, maybe more than you.	Ndincede abantu abaninzi, mhlawumbi ngaphezu kwakho.
I don't have a good answer to that.	Andinayo impendulo entle kuloo nto.
But it happened again and again.	Kodwa kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
It's as good as you.	Kungcono njengawe.
He retired shortly thereafter.	Wathatha umhlala-phantsi kungekudala emva koko.
You always get better.	Uhlala ungcono.
I did not want to stay.	Ndandingafuni kuhlala.
They live at home.	Bahlala ekhaya.
Therefore, he cannot speak.	Ngoko ke, akakwazi kuthetha.
But this has not been easy.	Kodwa oku akuzange kube lula.
So he decided to stay with me.	Ngoko ke, wagqiba ekubeni ahlale nam.
Tell me no one is doing this.	Ndixelele akukho mntu wenza oku.
Again this is not really necessary.	Kwakhona oku akufuneki ngokwenene.
You read regularly.	Ufunda rhoqo.
The big question is what to look for.	Umbuzo omkhulu kukuba kufuneka ujonge ntoni.
They will create something new.	Baya kudala into entsha.
And once you've done that you can't stop.	Kwaye emva kokuba uyenzile awukwazi ukuyeka.
Don't buy from it.	Musa ukuthenga kuyo.
And it was good.	Kwaye kube kuhle.
And a lot of money.	Kwaye imali eninzi.
I will say nothing.	andiyi kuthetha nto.
If you really want and need to have it.	Ukuba ufuna ngokwenene kwaye kufuneka ube naye.
It is good to be angry about that.	Kulungile ukuba nomsindo ngaloo nto.
It will not be the same for you.	Akuyi kuba njalo kuwe.
But, of course, one will succeed.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, umntu uya kuphumelela.
It's already done.	Sele yenziwe.
But he also did not tell me everything.	Kodwa naye akazange andixelele yonke into.
Upstairs, go to the office.	Phezulu, uye eofisini.
I wish to speak with you.	Ndinqwenela ukuthetha nawe.
I've always wanted to say that.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukuyithetha lonto.
That is good and right.	Oko kulungile kwaye kulungile.
Not to be successful.	Hayi ukuphumelela.
You know your place and you live in it.	Uyayazi indawo yakho kwaye uhlala kuyo.
They are completely dead.	Wafa nzima.
I'm scared now.	Ndiyoyika ngoku.
What you are tired of.	Oko udiniwe.
He almost talked to me.	Uphantse ukuthetha nam.
Yes, but me.	Ewe, kodwa mna.
That is clearly the case.	Oko kunjalo ngokucacileyo.
I myself do not care.	Mna ngokwam andikhathali.
No problem'.	Akukho ngxaki'.
But he is afraid to tell you.	Kodwa uyoyika ukukuxelela.
Yes, yes, it is true.	Ewe, ewe, yinyani.
I learned a lot, too.	Ndifunde okuninzi, nam.
There is no problem at all with that.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela kuloo nto.
There is a lot of space there.	Kukho indawo eninzi apho.
But you can't read money in class.	Kodwa awukwazi ukufunda imali eklasini.
It will happen that way.	Kuya kwenzeka ngolo hlobo.
Not so today.	Namhlanje akunjalo.
But later it becomes fun.	Kodwa kamva kuba mnandi.
That would be a good thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto entle.
Or alcohol.	Okanye utywala.
Or someone to talk to.	Okanye umntu oza kuthetha naye.
He knows full well that he is not.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba ayinguye.
New house.	Indlu entsha.
It's an old thing now.	Yinto endala ngoku.
We want life together.	Sifuna ubomi kunye.
He will stay with me.	Uya kuhlala nam.
You can too.	Nawe unokuba nayo.
I can swim, obviously.	Ndiyakwazi ukuqubha, ngokucacileyo.
But that would be much easier.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuba lula kakhulu.
He sits and watches.	Uhlala kwaye ujonge.
His wife was terrified.	Umfazi wakhe wayesoyika.
I could not do my job.	Andikwazanga ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
Maybe nowhere now.	Mhlawumbi akukho ndawo ngoku.
You can't think too much.	Awukwazi ukucinga kakhulu.
This is my baby.	Ngumntwana wam lo.
It is my job to speak.	Ngumsebenzi wam ukuthetha.
I will never do it again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndiyenze kwakhona.
Or he may be joking about us.	Okanye inokuba udlala ngathi.
Yes, it is time for us to leave.	Ewe, lixesha lokuba sihambe.
Then there is this.	Emva koko kukho oku.
So maybe yes.	Ngoko mhlawumbi ewe.
Great job!.	Umsebenzi omhle kakhulu!.
He never stopped, and he never will.	Akazange ayeke, kwaye akanakuze ayeke.
We will make our money.	Siza kuyenza imali yethu.
Last night you feel very old now.	Phezolo uziva kudala kakhulu ngoku.
But we certainly know this.	Kodwa siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
I wanted one now.	Bendifuna enye ngoku.
He almost hoped he would do it.	Phantse wayenethemba lokuba uya kwenza njalo.
I'm here for my money.	Ndilapha ngemali yam.
Before one arrives first.	Ngaphambi kokuba umntu afike kuqala.
I really look forward to it.	Ngenene ndijonge phambili kuyo.
We need to move forward now.	Kufuneka siye phambili ngoku.
I don't know that.	Andikwazi oko.
He knew that he had done his best.	Wayesazi ukuba wenze konke okusemandleni akhe.
By my side.	Ecaleni lam.
Very low indeed.	Phantsi kakhulu ngokwenene.
Tell me first about yourself.	Ndixelele kuqala ngawe.
But you did something else with him.	Kodwa wenze enye into naye.
Not now and not here.	Hayi ngoku kwaye hayi apha.
But she is happy.	Kodwa uyavuya.
I mean really hard.	Ndithetha nzima ngokwenene.
That's your problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki yakho.
He did everything right.	Wenza yonke into elungileyo.
Then you probably have a problem.	Emva koko mhlawumbi unengxaki.
Maybe you want to be with me.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuba nam.
I just love football.	Ndiyayithanda nje ibhola.
I hope everyone will succeed in that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu uya kuphumelela kuloo nto.
It takes two to do that.	Kuthatha ezimbini ukwenza oko.
If you don't want one, you really want one.	Ukuba awufuni, ufuna ngokwenene enye.
This is absolutely happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
That's my problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki yam.
Yes, that seems better.	Ewe, oko kubonakala kungcono.
And so, not really.	Kwaye ke, akunjalo.
I know what's going to happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Everyone needs someone.	Wonke umntu ufuna umntu.
Maybe this one.	Mhlawumbi lo.
This is going to be something that happens here.	Oku kuya kuba yinto eyenzekayo apha.
And you told him.	Kwaye umxelele .
Great question !.	Umbuzo omkhulu!.
He wishes that.	Unqwenela ukuba.
This is not fun at all.	Akukho mnandi kwaphela oku.
We are looking for a new way.	Sifuna indlela entsha.
But this is now very difficult.	Kodwa oku ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
But he would wait.	Kodwa wayeza kulinda.
School work.	Umsebenzi wesikolo.
And he speaks almost every day.	Kwaye uthetha phantse yonke imihla.
One death occurred during this time.	Ukufa omnye kwenzeka ngeli xesha.
I think everyone knows.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyazi.
That must be a child.	Kumele ukuba ngumntwana lowo.
Some go home and some stay.	Abanye baya ekhaya kwaye abanye bahlala.
So far, he has not.	Okwangoku, akazange.
No, he is not with me.	Hayi, akakho nam.
It will be difficult, of course.	Kuya kuba nzima, kunjalo.
I will say the same thing.	Ndiza kuthetha into enye.
He didn't tell me everything much.	Akazange andixelele yonke into eninzi.
That is why we need your help.	Yiyo loo nto sifuna uncedo lwakho.
It works very perfectly.	Usebenza kakhulu ngokupheleleyo.
Really, I want to do that again.	Ngokwenene, ndifuna ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
So are you.	Unjalo wena.
Tell me what the problem is.	Ndixelele ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
I want him to stop talking.	Ndifuna ayeke ukuthetha.
He really wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe.
So it is possible for him to have it.	Ngoko kunokwenzeka ukuba abe nayo.
Tell everyone the truth.	Xelela wonke umntu inyaniso.
He decided to make the place.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ayenze loo ndawo.
I wanted to have it too.	Ndandifuna nathi sibe nayo.
So seeing this comes back good.	Ke ukubona oku kubuya kuhle.
Soon, he found meat.	Kungekudala, wafumana inyama.
But soon, she returned.	Kodwa kungekudala, wabuyela kuyo.
He did not want to talk about what he had done.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngento ayenzileyo.
What will they do with it ?.	Baza kwenza ntoni ngayo?.
But that will come.	Kodwa oko kuya kuza.
Mistakes for sure.	Iimpazamo ngokuqinisekileyo.
But you have improved your work.	Kodwa wenze ngcono umsebenzi wakho.
He died and lived.	Wafa waza wahlala.
If only .	Ukuba kuphela .
Finally, he sat back and looked.	Ekugqibeleni, wahlala emva waza wajonga.
We really shouldn’t have gone.	Ngenene bekungafanelanga sihambe.
And any.	Kwaye nayiphi na .
One person speaks at a time.	Umntu omnye uthetha ngexesha.
It's hard now, you know.	Kunzima ngoku, uyazi.
He did it just because he wanted to.	Wayenza kuba nje efuna.
He did not tell anyone about this.	Akazange athethe mntu ngale nto.
I came here for you.	Ndize apha ngenxa yakho.
We want you to stay at work.	Sifuna ukuba uhlale emsebenzini.
You may know it as well as later.	Usenokuba uyazi ngoku njengokuba kamva.
So you're glad you like it.	Ngoko uyavuya uyayithanda.
You really want to talk about me.	Ufuna nyani ukuthetha ngam.
But now! 	Kodwa ngoku!
I mean just a little bit.	Ndithetha nje kancinci.
Do you think we want to be this way.	Ngaba ucinga ukuba sifuna ukuba ngolu hlobo.
He hoped he would arrive on time.	Wayenethemba lokuba uza kufika ngexesha.
The same thing could happen again.	Kusenokwenzeka into efanayo kwakhona.
But this is not easy.	Kodwa oku akukho lula.
But you too.	Kodwa nawe.
I would love to help !.	Ndingathanda ukunceda!.
Well, this would be a good idea to try just about anything.	Ke, oku kuya kuba kuhle ukuzama nje nantoni na.
He told me what had happened.	Wandixelela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
And that, obviously, is fine.	Kwaye oko, ngokucacileyo, kulungile.
No need, you will wait.	Akuyomfuneko, uya kulinda.
I want to go to the park.	Ndifuna ukuya epakini.
And of course you have to come.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka uze.
I really don't see anything else.	Ngokwenene andiboni enye into.
He never thought of himself.	Akazange acinge ngaye ngokwakhe.
Not your dad, obviously.	Hayi utata wakho, ngokucacileyo.
Now this is very good.	Ngoku oku kuhle kakhulu.
I just wanted to play.	Ndandifuna nje ukudlala.
I need to talk to you clearly once and for all.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe ngokucacileyo kube kanye.
However, it is not necessary.	Nangona kunjalo, akuyomfuneko.
Yes, not only that.	Ewe, hayi kuphela.
He never was too much.	Akazange abe kakhulu.
This happened, then.	Oku kwenzeka, emva koko.
Although not perfect, it is very good.	Nangona engalunganga, kulungile kakhulu.
He wants you to leave.	Ufuna uhambe.
He is, he is the only one.	Nguye, nguye yedwa.
It is not necessary to stay two hours.	Akuyomfuneko ukuhlala iiyure ezimbini.
Everyone reads this in the end.	Wonke umntu ufunda oku ekugqibeleni.
Being a man enough in my time.	Ukuba yindoda ngokwaneleyo ngexesha lam.
However, it is not the only old thing here.	Nangona kunjalo, ayisiyiyo kuphela into endala kakhulu apha.
But not so far here.	Kodwa akunjalo kude apha.
He looked ugly, very ugly.	Wayekhangeleka embi, embi kakhulu.
I want all his money.	Ndifuna yonke imali yakhe.
He has to think things through.	Kufuneka acinge izinto.
French is the case.	IsiFrentshi kunjalo.
Now he is gone.	Ngoku uye wemka.
I also do not believe it !.	Nam andikholelwa!.
But this cannot happen fast enough.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
He's here, now.	Ulapha, ngoku.
He did not do that either.	Naye akenzanga njalo.
I know it's a good thing to do.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
Yes my father is right.	Ewe utata wam kunjalo.
It's nothing to come here for.	Asiyonto eze apha.
Yes to me.	Ewe kum.
You made mistakes.	Wenza iimpazamo.
She is, too.	Unjalo, naye.
Yesterday you understood.	Izolo uye waqonda.
Very well.	Kakhulu kakuhle.
But it can be difficult.	Kodwa kunokuba nzima.
I always think about it and think about it.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngayo kwaye ndicinga ngayo.
Because it is, indeed.	Ngokuba kunjalo, ngenene.
And we will wait.	Kwaye siza kulinda.
But at the moment there is no place to stay.	Kodwa okwangoku akukho ndawo yokuhlala.
I know you don't want to do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba awufuni ukwenza ngolu hlobo.
But you do not have to stay.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba uhlale.
He said that would happen, and he took my money.	Wathi oko kuya kwenzeka, kwaye wathatha imali yam.
You said you wanted to go to school.	Ubuthe ufuna ukuya esikolweni.
People will come regularly.	Abantu baya kuza rhoqo.
No one knew what to do with him.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaye.
I hope you like being alone, as.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyathanda ukuba wedwa, njengoko.
I wanted to buy a new house.	Bendifuna ukuthenga indlu entsha.
I want more time there.	Ndifuna ixesha elininzi phaya.
You think everyone is just like you.	Ucinga ukuba wonke umntu ufana nawe.
John left in the afternoon for work.	UJohn wahamba emva kwemini emsebenzini.
He went to bed.	Waya ebhedini.
Unless you know that and he didn't say anything.	Ngaphandle kokuba uyayazi loo nto kwaye akazange athethe nto.
But it is not as easy as it seems.	Kodwa akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
It's a whole new job.	Ngumsebenzi omtsha ngokupheleleyo.
There will always be something.	Kuya kuhlala kukho into.
Location, or no place.	Indawo, okanye akukho ndawo.
Very nice thing indeed.	Into entle kakhulu ngenene.
Not something new.	Hayi into entsha.
You have probably seen it everywhere.	Mhlawumbi uye wabona yonke indawo.
Clearly man.	Ngokucacileyo umntu.
The same.	Enjalo.
It seems to me that this is the case.	Kubonakala kum ukuba oku kunjalo.
This seemed possible.	Oku kwakubonakala kunokwenzeka.
He felt not alone.	Waziva engekho yedwa.
Who did you tell.	Umxelele bani.
And he just didn't.	Kwaye akazange nje.
Now it's true.	Ngoku yinyani.
Well, he is not.	Kulungile, akanjalo.
However, you do not have to do that.	Nangona kunjalo, akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oko.
Just a name.	Igama nje.
He told me his name.	Wandixelela igama lakhe.
Anyone who is.	Nabani na kwaye.
He never tried to do that.	Akazange azame ukwenza oko.
Well maybe it will.	Kulungile mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
He was coming late.	Wayeza emva kwexesha.
I saw why you think so.	Ndabona ukuba kutheni ucinga njalo.
I never did, myself.	Andizange ndenze, mna.
I would love to work with you !.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza nawe!.
He should have time for himself.	Kufuneka abe nexesha lakhe yedwa.
Not tomorrow night, but soon.	Hayi ngomso ebusuku, kodwa kungekudala.
If you know how.	Ukuba uyazi ukuba njani.
Not immediately, of course.	Hayi ngoko nangoko, kunjalo.
But he never spoke to me.	Kodwa akazange athethe nam.
Zange.	Zange .
I do it before you.	Ndiyenza phambi kwakho.
What a small.	Yintoni encinci .
I don't know why, but you know.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa uyazi.
I went to class.	Ndaya eklasini.
Maybe you can't.	Mhlawumbi awukwazi.
He or she would like your help in this, if possible.	Angathanda uncedo lwakho kule nto, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He didn't and he doesn't know it.	Akazange kwaye akayazi.
One or two, now and then.	Enye okanye ezimbini, ngoku kwaye ngoko.
It means success.	Kuthetha ukuphumelela.
There was no reason for him to be.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba abe njalo.
And his work will last forever.	Kwaye umsebenzi wakhe uya kuhlala uhleli.
Almost nothing.	Phantse akukho nto.
He wanted his story.	Wayefuna ibali lakhe.
I'll see how to do it tomorrow.	Ndiza kubona indlela yokwenza ngomso.
And we all know why.	Kwaye sonke siyazi ukuba kutheni.
I will be very angry.	Ndiya kuba nomsindo kakhulu.
You need to go to him now.	Kufuneka uye kuye ngoku.
It will be difficult to get the job done.	Kuya kuba nzima ukwenza umsebenzi.
It's something now.	Yinto ngoku.
There is no better.	Akukho ngcono.
And so he asked.	Kwaye ngoko wabuza.
There is a way here.	Kukho indlela apha.
You knew it was.	Ubusazi ukuba yiyo.
However, not so much at this time.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho kakhulu ngeli xesha.
No one has told him that yet.	Nje akukho mntu umxelele oko okwangoku.
I'm just trying to help you.	Ndizama nje ukukunceda.
You better come to my house.	Kungcono uze endlini yam.
One has to do something.	Umntu kufuneka enze into.
It will be good for us.	Kuya kuba kuhle kuthi.
I wanted to go regularly.	Ndandifuna ukuya rhoqo.
He did not want to come back.	Wayengafuni kubuya.
There is something wrong, or very, very good.	Kukho into engalunganga, okanye kakhulu, elungileyo kakhulu.
I want everything.	Ndifuna yonke into.
All right, with me.	Kulungile, kunye nam.
Moreover, it happens.	Ngaphezu koko, kwenzeka.
My father knew everything.	Utata wayesazi yonke into.
He never thought.	Zange acinge.
He did it to make my job difficult.	Wakwenza oko ukuze enze umsebenzi wam ube nzima.
I want one too.	Ndifuna enye nam.
Yes, we will see !.	Ewe, siza kubona!.
Let me look here.	Makhe ndijonge apha.
That's what you're good at.	Yiloo nto ulungile kuyo.
So he decided to go.	Ngoko, wagqiba kwelokuba ahambe.
Or maybe with it.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngayo.
Not you.	Akukho wena.
That's fine, that's fine.	Oko kulungile, kunjalo.
He was like that now.	Waba njalo ngoku.
I did not want to be in this situation with him.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kule meko naye.
He never tried again.	Akazange aphinde azame.
He spoke and spoke.	Wathetha ethetha.
Don't do it again.	Musa ukuyenza kwakhona.
It was all clear.	Kwakucacile konke.
One day he did not come home at all.	Ngenye imini akazange afike tu ekhaya.
He stayed for three weeks.	Wahlala iiveki ezintathu.
Everyone thinks that.	Wonke umntu ucinga ukuba.
Almost read me, it seems.	Phantse ukufunda mna, kubonakala.
I will leave in time.	Ndiza kuhamba kwangethuba.
As if nothing had happened.	Ngathi akuzange kwenzeke nto.
I don't have to repeat.	Akufuneki ndiphinde.
One seldom thinks about it.	Umntu akafane acinge ngayo.
The answer is probably.	Impendulo mhlawumbi.
I just want to see my son.	Ndifuna nje ukubona unyana wam.
He did not know what he was planning to do.	Wayengazi ukuba uceba ntoni.
He gave me everything.	Wandinika yonke into.
I wanted that back.	Ndandifuna oko emva.
Just as he was afraid.	Kanye njengoko wayesoyika.
It is even more possible.	Kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
You have a mind.	Unayo ingqondo.
I speak really badly.	Ndithetha kakubi ngokwenene.
A little, but not really.	Kancinci, kodwa hayi ngokwenene.
He told her, exactly.	Wamxelela, kanye.
I did not know yet.	Andizange ndiyazi okwangoku.
He realized that it was so.	Waqonda ukuba kunjalo.
He got out of there quickly.	Waphuma apho ngokukhawuleza.
Everything seemed too old.	Konke kwakubonakala kudala kakhulu.
Only, he did not appear.	Kuphela, akazange abonakale.
But he came in.	Kodwa wangena.
They say this has happened.	Bathi kwenzeke oku.
But above all.	Kodwa ngaphezu kwakho konke.
I'm sorry.	Uxolo lwam.
I think we'll see in that.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kubona kuloo nto.
Just a big bike.	Ibhayisekile nje enkulu.
You know you never did that.	Uyazi ukuba awuzange uyenze loo nto.
Not until then.	Hayi kude kube ngoko.
A few things really.	Izinto ezimbalwa ngokwenene.
Since then, not so much.	Ukusukela ngoko, hayi kakhulu.
Or a house.	Okanye indlu.
The road comes to town.	Indlela iza edolophini.
You go to him.	Uya kuye.
One day all will be well.	Ngenye imini konke kuya kuba ngcono.
A really big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu ngokwenene.
Something about being late.	Into malunga nokuba late.
He never said anything about you to me.	Zange athethe nto ngawe kum.
Not too much travel.	Hayi ukuhamba kakhulu.
Very much all.	Kakhulu bonke.
This can be a big deal.	Oku kunokuba yinto enkulu.
Not too early.	Akukho kwangethuba.
He wanted to know where he was.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba uphi na.
I can't help it right now.	Andikwazi ukuzibamba okwangoku.
Doing less but doing better.	Ukwenza kancinci kodwa ukwenza ngcono.
And we'll start right away.	Kwaye siza kuqala kwangoko.
No one knew why or how it happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwakutheni okanye kwenzeke njani.
This is how it happened.	Kwenzeka ngolu hlobo ke.
Nobody seems to want me here.	Akukho mntu ubonakala endifuna apha.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Akukho nto inokuba lula ngakumbi.
He did not, but only.	Akazange, kodwa kuphela.
Or come to anyone.	Okanye eza nabani na.
You knew nothing.	Ubungazi nto.
Alternate name.	Elinye igama.
You don't have to be out there at night.	Akufunekanga ukuba ube phaya phandle ebusuku.
I've always talked about it.	Bendisoloko ndithetha ngayo.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba kutheni.
I'm not sure what his problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
Thinking about you.	Ndicinga ngawe.
And then, yes, the picture again.	Kwaye ke, ewe, umfanekiso kwakhona.
He told his wife to stay.	Waxelela umfazi wakhe ukuba ahlale.
There is a father.	Kukho utata.
Look at the school.	Jonga esikolweni.
He left yesterday.	Uhambe izolo.
I think though.	Ndicinga nangona kunjalo.
You never really did.	Awuzange ngokwenene.
If so then and if so.	Ukuba ke ngenye indlela kwaye ukuba kunjalo.
I forgot to mention it yesterday.	Ndilibele ukuyithetha izolo.
So they will talk.	Ngoko baya kuthetha.
With that, there was no question.	Ngaloo nto, kwakungekho mbuzo.
But you know us.	Kodwa uyasazi.
You’re even smarter maybe.	Ukrelekrele ngakumbi mhlawumbi.
I live in a house.	Ndihlala endlini.
Only now did he not give up.	Kuphela ngoku akazange ayeke.
Although .	Nangona .
Everyone heard things.	Wonke umntu weva izinto.
She is lucky to have him.	Unethamsanqa lokuba naye.
You just have to stay.	Kufuneka ukuhlala kuphela.
I had to be with you again.	Kwafuneka ndibe nawe kwakhona.
He has come out of her.	Uye waphuma kuye.
Week if possible.	Iveki ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Everyone wanted to get out and go home.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuphuma aye ekhaya.
Today was not about that.	Namhlanje kwakungekho malunga naloo nto.
And besides, he can do his own thing.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, angayenza into yakhe.
We will continue to take that approach.	Siza kuqhubeka ukuthatha loo ndlela.
But it is time to do something new.	Kodwa lixesha lokwenza into entsha.
I did not go to the office.	Khange ndiye eofisini.
Very early, obviously.	Kwangoko kakhulu, ngokucacileyo.
In the end, he said it was all right.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi kulungile.
Maybe soon enough.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
You do not have to go to any trouble for me.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uye kuyo nayiphi na ingxaki ngenxa yam.
Yes, you will surely be upset.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba nomsindo.
It must be here.	Kufuneka elapha.
But the wait is too long.	Kodwa ukulinda kude kakhulu.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki kuyo nantoni na.
That means now.	Oko kuthetha ngoku.
But eventually he had to leave.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kwafuneka ahambe.
I have done everything.	Ndiyenze yonke into.
A little, a little bit.	Kancinci, kancinci kancinci.
He thought he died immediately after that.	Wayecinga ukuba wafa ngoko nangoko emva koko.
That makes it easier to stay.	Oko kwenza kube lula ukuhlala.
This person has gone to the bedroom.	Lo mntu uye waya kwigumbi lokulala.
Much as it is, of course.	Kakhulu njengokuba, kunjalo.
I did not know which way to go.	Bendingayazi ukuba yeyiphi na indlela.
That no one, really.	Oko akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
At work.	Emsebenzini.
Certainly, my truth.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, inyaniso yam.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi mna.
But it had to be everything or nothing.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba yonke into okanye akukho nto.
But before he could drive.	Kodwa ngaphambi kokuba aqhube.
This takes up a lot of my time.	Oku kuthatha ixesha lam elininzi.
Give me a quick answer.	Ndinike impendulo ngokukhawuleza.
You have the answer.	Unayo impendulo.
He looked down at everyone.	Wajonga wonke umntu phantsi.
Not to stay.	Hayi ukuhlala.
He certainly did not want to be that way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengafuni ukuba njalo.
I think in advance it is better.	Ndicinga ukuba kwangethuba kungcono.
And we want to.	Kwaye sifuna.
Your mother? 	Umama wakho?
That's really everything.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene yonke into.
Yes he loves her.	Ewe uyamthanda.
He works fast.	Usebenza ngokukhawuleza.
No one said anything at first.	Akukho mntu wathetha nto ekuqaleni.
Now you have to go.	Ngoku kufuneka uhambe.
I just thought of a plan.	Ndacinga nje icebo.
And he will not be alone.	Kwaye akayi kuba yedwa.
You have to tell him the truth.	Kufuneka umxelele nyani.
Well, maybe not the answer, but the answer.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi impendulo, kodwa impendulo.
Two hours away.	Iiyure ezimbini kude.
We know what's coming.	Siyazi into ezayo.
But maybe something.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kukho into.
And I don't know why.	Kwaye andazi ukuba kutheni.
He went to school there.	Waya esikolweni apho.
Maybe it takes time.	Mhlawumbi kuthatha ixesha.
Today, this is not the case.	Namhlanje, oku akunjalo.
This is not far off.	Oku akukho kude.
But then he heard another voice.	Kodwa emva koko weva elinye ilizwi.
I know you speak well, but.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kakuhle, kodwa .
Everything seems fine.	Konke kubonakala kulungile.
I read about it here.	Ndifunde ngayo apha.
I tried to take my life.	Ndazama ukuthatha ubomi bam.
For this, please take a look here.	Kule nto, nceda ujonge apha.
But thank you for that.	Kodwa enkosi kunjalo.
Moreover, it is.	Ngaphezu koko, kunjalo.
Look over there now.	Jonga phaya ngoku.
He decided to go alone.	Wagqiba kwelokuba ahambe yedwa.
It’s really better together.	Kungcono ngokwenene kunye.
Then we will do that.	Emva koko siya kuyenza loo nto.
I have to think about that.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
I love your book.	Ndiyayithanda incwadi yakho.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Kungcono ukunceda kunokuba buhlungu.
Unless we now know he came back here.	Ngaphandle kokuba ngoku siyazi wabuyela apha.
I'm here behind him.	Ndilapha emva kwakhe.
It would have been better if he had not done it.	Kunokuba ngcono ukuba akenzanga.
That is good for us.	Oko kulungile kuthi.
There is someone else, though.	Kukho omnye umntu, nangona kunjalo.
He was not really visible.	Wayengabonakali ngokwenene.
Do not make the mistake of pretending to be someone else.	Musa ukwenza impazamo yokwenza ngathi ngenye indlela.
I don't want to see anyone stay long.	Andifuni kubona mntu uhlala ixesha elide.
I told everyone.	Ndaxelela wonke umntu.
More, now, more.	Ngakumbi, ngoku, ngakumbi.
Well, now we will.	Ewe, ngoku siza kwenza njalo.
If that is not possible, we will not try.	Ukuba akunakwenzeka, asiyi kuzama.
He has slept in the same bed with her.	Uye walala ebhedini enye naye.
Doing too many things.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
And we should too.	Kwaye kufuneka nathi.
He wanted to do it again.	Wayefuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
Three more people, then my time.	Abanye abantu abathathu, emva koko ixesha lam.
Then comes the case.	Emva koko kuza ityala.
He must have slept through the night.	Umele ukuba walala ubusuku bonke.
Or maybe something else.	Okanye mhlawumbi enye into.
I came to work.	Ndize emsebenzini.
It's hard to stay.	Kunzima ukuhlala.
We will buy.	Siza kuthenga.
I love this about him.	Ndiyayithanda lento ngaye.
Probably not yet.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo nangoko.
Sure, that's it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, leyo yinto.
I had to wait and see.	Kwafuneka ndilinde ndibone.
I have done a few.	Ndenze ezimbalwa.
What is the best place ?.	Yeyiphi indawo engcono?.
He has agreed to do that.	Uye wavuma ukuyenza loo nto.
No more .	Hayi kwakhona .
Tell me that's okay.	Ndixelele ukuba oko kulungile.
He looked only at her.	Wajonga kuye kuphela.
And no, not everything.	Kwaye hayi, hayi yonke into.
Sounds like right.	Kubonakala ngathi ilungile.
Coming home.	Ukuza ekhaya.
And it's okay if you should.	Kwaye kulungile ukuba ufanele.
Or just being there.	Okanye ukuba khona nje.
You better go to your room.	Kungcono uye egumbini lakho.
I didn't know you could do it.	Bendingazi ukuba ungayenza.
It is my job to get out.	Ngumsebenzi wam ukuphuma ngaphandle.
Not everyone has his book.	Akukho ncwadi yakhe wonke umntu.
But in this case, no, not really.	Kodwa kule nto, hayi, hayi ngokwenene.
It does happen in this case however.	Kwenzeka kule meko nangona kunjalo.
You do this very well.	Uyenza kakuhle kakhulu le nto.
He built a big house.	Wakha indlu enkulu.
He is good to everything.	Ulungile kuyo yonke into.
If you made a mistake, you made a mistake.	Ukuba wenze impazamo, wenza impazamo.
Well, yes, he knew why.	Ewe, ewe, wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Eyes successful.	Amehlo aphumelele.
I have to do it too.	Nam kufuneka ndiyenze.
But this, he thought.	Kodwa oku, wacinga.
Obviously, he doesn't.	Ngokucacileyo, akayi.
Everything is fine, however.	Yonke into ilungile, kodwa.
Not at all, then.	Akunjalo konke konke, ngoko.
He told her for sure.	Wamxelela ngokuqinisekileyo.
So your question.	Ngoko umbuzo wakho.
I can't say much for myself.	Andikwazi kuthetha okuninzi ngokwam.
You know my way.	Uyayazi indlela yam.
I couldn't help but look at him.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ndijonge kuye.
He immediately realized that something was wrong.	Waqonda ngoko nangoko ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
No one needs to know about it.	Akukho mntu kufuneka azi ngaloo nto.
Everyone is here except you.	Wonke umntu ulapha ngaphandle kwakho.
Or a book.	Okanye incwadi.
You do not want to be alone, too.	Awufuni ukuba wedwa, nawe.
See how it is.	Ukubona ukuba njani.
He loves his house, but not everyone.	Uyayithanda indlu yakhe, kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu.
I could not read any of it.	Andikwazanga ukufunda nayiphi na kuyo.
But he has to go.	Kodwa kufuneka ahambe.
Then, finally, people.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni, abantu.
There seems to be something wrong with me.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into engalunganga kum.
So it will be many more days.	Ngoko kuya kuba iintsuku ezininzi ngakumbi.
Staying is your thing.	Ukuhlala yinto yakho.
He doesn't know how.	Akayazi ukuba njani.
Some, not all.	Abanye, hayi bonke.
Before he did.	Ngaphambi kokuba ayenze.
And now, that's good for you.	Kwaye ngoku, oko kulungile kuwe.
Otherwise it would be difficult.	Ngaphandle koko bekuya kuba nzima.
There is something, something, something.	Kukho into, into, into.
Maybe you found peace.	Mhlawumbi wafumana uxolo.
But there is something wrong with her.	Kodwa kukho into engalunganga ngaye.
He is not far off from us.	Akakho kude kuthi .
It was not easy for me to talk about it.	Kwakungekho lula kum ukuthetha ngayo.
I really want him to agree.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba avume.
I talk to him regularly.	Ndithetha naye rhoqo.
You have everything else.	Unayo yonke enye into.
We'll go slowly, this time.	Siza kuhamba kancinci, ngeli xesha.
Really, it can be very fun.	Ngokwenene, kunokuba mnandi kakhulu.
Well, this makes you very sad.	Ke, oku kukwenza ube buhlungu kakhulu.
No one suggested an answer.	Akukho mntu wacebisa impendulo.
Well, to me it is not.	Ewe, kum akunjalo.
Nobody just lives in town.	Akukho mntu uhlala nje edolophini.
To see what will happen.	Ukubona into eza kwenzeka.
However, you are reading a book.	Nangona kunjalo, ufunda incwadi.
There was no one either.	Kwakungekho mntu bobabini.
I told her not to come again.	Ndamxelela ukuba angaphindi eze.
And to be here.	Kwaye ukuba lapha.
I'll tell her that.	Ndiza kumxelela loo nto.
Everywhere, it's a really good thing.	Kuyo yonke indawo, yinto entle ngokwenene.
He lives and studies.	Uhlala kwaye ufunda.
That's the right thing to do.	Nantso into elungileyo ukuyenza.
It goes very well for me there.	Kuhamba kakuhle kakhulu kum apho.
Well, it's better to die, he admitted.	Ewe, kungcono ukufa, wavuma.
And we never knew.	Kwaye asizange siyazi.
But this time he said, yes.	Kodwa ngeli xesha wathi, ewe.
It seemed very difficult to think.	Kwakubonakala kunzima kakhulu ukucinga.
You can't stop things.	Awukwazi ukuyeka izinto.
Very much like me.	Kakhulu njengam.
He has done all this before.	Uye wakwenza konke oku ngaphambili.
Maybe you're trying too hard.	Mhlawumbi uzama kakhulu.
I don't always want to.	Andifuni rhoqo.
Maybe it will get better.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono.
Don't think again.	Musa ukucinga kwakhona.
Where possible you are right.	Apho kunokwenzeka ukuba ulungile.
We know you want a car that looks good.	Siyazi ukuba ufuna imoto ebonakala ilungile.
We will go here.	Siza kuhamba apha.
No, you should.	Hayi, ufanele.
One more thing, you can't succeed.	Enye into, awukwazi ukuphumelela.
He probably knew that this would happen.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayesazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
He would get to it tomorrow.	Wayeza kufika kuyo kusasa.
It is something that happens every day.	Yinto eyenzekayo yonke imihla.
My mother knew.	Umama wayesazi.
One after another after another.	Omnye emva komnye emva komnye.
I will be able to eat, eat, eat.	Ndiza kukwazi ukutya, ukutya, ukutya.
Maybe a gun.	Mhlawumbi umpu.
He never went there without me.	Zange aye apho ngaphandle kwam.
I hope you can do it !.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ungayenza!.
One understood.	Omnye waqonda.
He is here today.	Ulapha namhlanje.
He told me it would last two weeks.	Uye wandixelela ukuba iza kuhlala iiveki ezimbini.
It is the same again.	Kunjalo kwakhona.
No, it seems to us.	Akunjalo, kubonakala ngathi.
It will all mean the same thing.	Konke kuya kuthetha into enye.
I love my house.	Ndiyayithanda indlu yam.
But it will be good for me.	Kodwa kuya kuba kuhle kum.
He is not even real.	Akakho nokuba yinyani.
But you may know better.	Kodwa usenokuba wazi ngcono.
Tomorrow is impossible.	Ngomso akunakwenzeka.
Shortly thereafter, another.	Kungekudala emva koko, enye.
And why everyone.	Kwaye kutheni wonke umntu.
Someone told her.	Umntu wamxelela.
This will mean success.	Oku kuya kuthetha ukuphumelela.
Or buy your own piano.	Okanye uthenge ipiyano yakho.
No one is always wrong.	Akukho mntu uhlala engalunganga.
That's whatever he wants to do.	Yiyo nantoni na afuna ukuyenza.
Again, this happened.	Kwakhona, oku kwenzeka.
Even for me.	Nokuba ngam.
There is a small problem though.	Kukho ingxaki encinci nangona kunjalo.
And it is even harder.	Kwaye kunzima ngakumbi.
Many say no.	Abaninzi bathi hayi.
Or maybe you do not know.	Okanye mhlawumbi awuyazi.
They did not go there.	Abazange baye apho.
He spends a lot of time away.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi kude.
Your father did not want to leave.	Utata wakho wayengafuni ukuhamba.
Sorry, but he is not at all.	Uxolo, kodwa ayinguye kwaphela.
Don't be a child.	Musa ukuba ngumntwana.
If you have a restaurant.	Ukuba unayo indawo yokutyela.
It's been too long.	Ke ixesha elide kakhulu.
Everyone loves it so much.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda kakhulu.
Bad, for sure.	Embi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Don't wait to get help.	Musa ukulinda ukufumana uncedo.
I was very good.	Ngaba kuhle kakhulu.
I'd better do this quickly, he thought.	Kungcono ndiyenze ngokukhawuleza oku, wacinga.
That never happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke oko.
He wants you to do it.	Ufuna ukuba uyenze.
He will be the first one for us to do it.	Uya kuba ngowokuqala kuthi ukuyenza.
In that case, he must do it.	Xa kunjalo, kufuneka ayenze loo nto.
And it will not be.	Kwaye akuyi kuba njalo.
A little about your work.	Kancinci ngomsebenzi wakho.
Where to buy now.	Apho ukuthenga khona ngoku.
Just a small thing.	Into nje encinci.
It happened at home.	Kwenzeke ekhaya.

He wouldn’t go, though.	Wayengayi, nangona kunjalo.
I'm not sure how you feel about it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uziva njani ngayo.

He's here now, he thought.	Ukhona ngoku, wacinga.
He tried anything.	Wazama nantoni na kanye.
I'm trying to do that.	Ndizama ukwenza oko.

Anyway, though.	Nangona kunjalo, nangona oku.
And you know it too.	Kwaye ukwazi kwakhona.
That's good .	Ilungile lonto .
Thank you very much.	Enkosi ngokukhawuleza.
This is obvious.	Le nto ngokucacileyo.
But I don't remember there.	Kodwa andikhumbuli apho.
That's the only time we have to go.	Elo kuphela ixesha ekufuneka sihambe ngalo.
But we will do it.	Kodwa siza kuyenza.
There is always there.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kukho.
My time here.	Ixesha lam apha.

I wanted you for me.	Bendifuna wena kum.
And he also did not give up.	Kwaye naye akazange ayeke.
Just as you like.	Kanye njengoko uthanda.
I never did that again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndiyenze loo nto.
But that will take years.	Kodwa oko kuya kuthatha iminyaka.
He slept badly.	Walala kakubi.
You have to tell me why you are doing this.	Kufuneka undixelele ukuba kutheni uyenza le nto.
Then he has to do this again at night.	Emva koko kufuneka enze oku kwakhona ebusuku.
No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do.	Nokuba uzama kangakanani, nokuba wenza ntoni na.
Everyone made a voice.	Wonke umntu wenza ilizwi.
One book is so.	Incwadi enye kunjalo.
They will say.	Baya kuthi .
So yeah, you know.	Ngoko ewe, uyazi.
He did just that, and people said no.	Wenze kanye loo nto, kwaye abantu bathi hayi.
Not monkeys.	Hayi nyani.
And of course, there are.	Kwaye kunjalo, kukho.
And there are more.	Kwaye kuza ezinye.
More than that, he wanted to do so.	Ngaphezu koko, wayefuna enjenjalo.
This really will not end well.	Oku ngenene akuyi kuphela kakuhle.
But there was nobody here.	Kodwa kwakungekho bani apha.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nceda, ndixelele ukuba yintoni.
The marriage did not last.	Umtshato awuzange uhlale.
I thought he wanted her to know.	Bendicinga ukuba uyafuna ukuba azi.
However you want to do this right for me.	Nangona kunjalo ufuna ukwenza oku kulungile kum.
You do not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube njalo.
You do as you wish.	Wenza njengoko ufuna.
Alone again alone.	Wedwa kwakhona wedwa.
Or maybe he is the only one.	Okanye mhlawumbi nguye kuphela.
We'll see how he does.	Siza kubona ukuba wenza njani.
He sat up.	Wahlala phezulu.
You have already done a very good job.	Sele wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
For he himself, now, may have loved her.	Kuba ngokwakhe, ngoku, usenokuba uyamthanda.
And maybe we'll get better at that.	Kwaye mhlawumbi siya kuba ngcono kuloo nto.
I'm not sure what the problem is here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki apha.
So you might be right.	Ngoko unokuba ulungile.
No to me, no, no.	Hayi kum, hayi, hayi.
He's gone too far now.	Uhambe kakhulu ngoku.
Where he would live.	Apho wayeza kuhlala khona.
But, if possible, here.	Kodwa, ukuba kunokwenzeka, apha.
We are fully aware of that fact.	Siyazi ngokupheleleyo loo nto.
In the meantime, tell your friends!	Okwangoku, xelela abahlobo bakho!.
That is always the case here.	Oko kuhlala kunjalo apha.
Very quickly as it is.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu njengoko kunjalo.
It's just completely new.	Yinto nje entsha ngokupheleleyo.
There is a better way out there.	Kukho indlela engcono phaya.
This happened a long time ago.	Oku kwenzeka kudala.
If so, .	Ukuba kunjalo, .
That is the case everywhere.	Oko kunjalo phantse kuyo yonke indawo.
You just live somewhere.	Uhlala nje kwindawo ethile.
He felt like before.	Waziva njengakuqala.
He seemed very strange.	Wayebonakala engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
He did not fully succeed, but he tried.	Akazange aphumelele ngokupheleleyo, kodwa wazama.
Don't try to do something.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza into.
No police.	Akukho ndawo amapolisa.
Here, look.	Apha, jonga.
You want to see things.	Ufuna ukubona izinto.
We deserve it too !.	Sifanele nathi!.
He had it for years.	Waba nayo iminyaka.
One did not stay here.	Omnye akazange ahlale apha.
He would do it himself, whatever it was.	Wayeza kuyenza ngokwakhe, nokuba yintoni na.
Maybe he thought about it himself.	Mhlawumbi wacinga ngayo ngokwakhe.
So, he has appeared this time.	Ngoko, uye wabonakala ngeli xesha.
He looked at the dog.	Wajonga inja.
It just didn't happen.	Ayizange yenzeke nje.
I'm not much right now.	Andikho kakhulu ngoku.
You are beautiful, too.	Nawe mhle, nawe.
He said that it did not have to be this way.	Wathi akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
Getting along well with children.	Ukuhamba kakuhle nabantwana.
Doing this alone.	Ukwenza oku yedwa.
He sits in his car.	Uhlala emotweni yakhe.
He would have to have it.	Bekuya kufuneka abe nayo.
I knew he was going to go.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuya.
I don't want him to stop.	Andifuni ayeke.
And in that place of residence.	Kwaye kuloo ndawo yokuhlala.
Waiting for something to happen.	Ukulinda into eyenzekayo.
I would love to know about it before.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ngayo ngaphambili.
His picture lay on the floor.	Umfanekiso wakhe walala phantsi.
He doesn't like that all the time.	Akayithandi loo nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
You don't have to be.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube.
And that person.	Kwaye loo mntu.
There should be people everywhere.	Bekufanele ukuba kukho abantu kuyo yonke indawo.
And my mother never spoke to him again.	Kwaye umama akazange aphinde athethe naye.
Not immediately.	Akukho ngokukhawuleza.
He went down immediately into the city.	Wehla kwangoko edolophini.
Maybe I think too much of it.	Mhlawumbi ndicinga kakhulu kuyo.
I don't know what's going on.	Andazi' ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
No, you certainly did not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo awuzange.
Probably a meeting.	Mhlawumbi intlanganiso.
He made mistakes with her.	Wenza naye iimpazamo.
I will have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka ndenze .
Time to do it !.	Ixesha lokuba wenze!.
I don't remember that.	Andikhumbuli naloo nto.
No problem at all to get there.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela ukufika apho.
How difficult.	Kunzima kangakanani.
I'm thinking of doing that too.	Ndicinga ukwenza loo nto nam.
However, nothing happened.	Kodwa ke, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
Then do things.	Emva koko wenze izinto.
When it was not necessary.	Xa kwakungeyomfuneko.
Not a single song.	Akukho ngoma enye.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona wethu.
Maybe you bought a small house.	Mhlawumbi uthenge indlu encinci.
He stayed.	Wahlala.
Death is hard.	Ukufa kunzima.
Not in the same way, obviously.	Akunjalo ngendlela efanayo, ngokucacileyo.
He ate breakfast.	Watya isidlo sakusasa.
And he won't be sad for her.	Kwaye akayi kuba buhlungu ngenxa yakhe.
I just couldn’t do it myself.	Andikwazanga nje ukuyenza mna.
No one was going to be his friend.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
I wanted more time.	Ndandifuna ixesha elingakumbi.
Others will come soon.	Abanye baza kuza kungekudala.
No one knows you better than you do.	Akukho mntu ukwazi ngcono kunawe.
His mind.	Ingqondo yakhe.
He ate very little.	Watya kancinci kakhulu.
He said he had to make that money.	Wathi kufuneka enze loo mali.
What will happen tomorrow?	Kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngomso.
He thought about money.	Wacinga ngemali.
I learned nothing.	Khange ndifunde nto.
I can't find the name.	Andikwazi kufumana igama.
I wanted more from him.	Ndandifuna ngakumbi kuye.
But you may have said something.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba uthethe into.
Nobody knew anything about it.	Kwakungekho mntu wazi nto ngayo.
I'm certainly not sure.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andiqinisekanga.
There is no question you are thinking about.	Akukho mbuzo ucinga ngayo.
That's why we have to go.	Yiyo le nto kufuneka sihambe.
And it just isn't.	Kwaye akunjalo nje.
There is always something new happening.	Kuhlala kukho into entsha eyenzekayo.
Purchase is no exception.	Ukuthenga akukho ngaphandle.
You know that people will do that.	Uyazi ukuba abantu baya kuyenza loo nto.
And we will be.	Kwaye siya kuba njalo.
Maybe you should sit down.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhlale phantsi.
If it is too good to be true, it probably is.	Ukuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
He has to move slowly.	Kufuneka ahambe kancinci.
There is a problem here.	Kukho ingxaki apha.
There is a lot of money in that area.	Kukho imali eninzi kakhulu kuloo ndawo.
But not everyone or everything seems to be the same.	Kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu okanye yonke into ebonakala ngathi.
I don't even care who did that.	Andikhathali nokuba ngubani owenze loo nto.
And tonight, of course.	Kwaye ubusuku, kunjalo.
Probably not too soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kakhulu.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngokuba ngaphambili.
At this point, it only happens to be a man.	Ngeli xesha, kwenzeka kuphela ukuba yindoda.
When you are ready.	Xa ulungile.
And he wanted to do it now.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuyenza ngoku.
For me now it is work.	Kum ngoku ngumsebenzi.
That's the other one down.	Yiyo enye phantsi.
It can be fun to play.	Kunokuba mnandi ukudlala.
True enough, but it's not a problem here.	Yinyani ngokwaneleyo, kodwa ayisiyiyo ingxaki apha.
Going forward everywhere.	Iya phambili kuyo yonke indawo.
You have to do things to be successful.	Kufuneka wenze izinto ukuze uphumelele.
Unless otherwise.	Ngaphandle kokuba mhlawumbi .
For my mind.	Kuba ingqondo yam.
There is almost no one there, ever.	Phantse akukho mntu apho, nanini na.
Soon, he left.	Kungekudala, wemka.
You’re probably so much better though.	Mhlawumbi ungcono kakhulu nangona kunjalo.
We will leave tomorrow night.	Siza kuhamba ngomso ebusuku.
Learning to speak.	Ukufunda ukuthetha.
That's the reason.	Nantso ke isizathu.
Maybe no, maybe yes.	Mhlawumbi hayi, mhlawumbi ewe.
They once said the name.	Bakhe bathi igama.
Or make it very difficult.	Okanye wenze ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
Everyone needs to be on time.	Kufuneka wonke umntu abe ngexesha.
I live in this area.	Ndihlala kule ndawo.
And it was not painful.	Kwaye kwakungekho buhlungu.
And they will continue with it, whatever happens.	Kwaye baya kuqhubeka nayo, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
Let me go.	Makhe ndihambe.
It means that.	Kuthetha ukuba .
You do .	Uyenza .
Not so with the question.	Akunjalo ngalo mbuzo.
I want to do something to help.	Ndifuna ukwenza into ukunceda.
I got home today.	Ndifike endlini namhlanje.
Impossible, if I tell you the truth.	Akunakwenzeka, ukuba ndikuxelele inyani.
I told her they would do it.	Ndamxelela ukuba baza kwenza njalo.
No one is talking about us.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngathi.
But otherwise.	Kodwa ngenye indlela.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma kwangoko.
It's a lot harder than you think.	Kunzima kakhulu kunokuba ucinga.
Obviously, too.	Ngokucacileyo, kakhulu.
That was nothing to me, of course.	Oko kwakungekho nto kum, kunjalo.
But it won't say much.	Kodwa akuyi kuthetha kakhulu.
My place.	Indawo yam.
Please tell the truth.	Ndicela uthethe inyani.
You know you deserve it.	Uyazi ukuba ufanele.
He didn't think of her.	Wayengacingi ngaye.
I have asked for a lot.	Ndiye ndacela into eninzi.
Not just me.	Hayi nje mna.
Sorry and thank you.	Uxolo kwaye enkosi.
They will do something.	Baza kwenza into.
We know everything that happens here.	Siyazi yonke into eyenzekayo apha.
And there is always a good place.	Kwaye kuhlala kukho indawo entle.
He just didn't want to know about us.	Wayengafuni nje ukwazi ngathi.
He drives.	Uqhuba .
Although, he doesn't know that.	Nangona, akayazi loo nto.
He said the same thing about you.	Wathetha into enye ngawe kanye.
And you work very hard on this problem.	Kwaye usebenza nzima kakhulu kule ngxaki.
And then it's nothing.	Kwaye ke asiyonto.
All right, sorry.	Kulungile, uxolo.
I thought the same thing with me.	Bendicinga into enye nam.
We better do it quickly.	Kungcono ukuba siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
Not really anything, but a lot of things.	Hayi ngokwenene nantoni na, kodwa izinto ezininzi.
Not just once, but time and time again.	Hayi nje kanye, kodwa ixesha kunye nexesha kwakhona.
No, this time, she really wanted to know.	Hayi, ngeli xesha, wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
You learn a lot from it.	Ufunda kakhulu kuyo.
Throughout this place.	Kuyo yonke le ndawo.
You will, of course.	Uya kufuna, kunjalo.
I just don't remember that question.	Andikhumbuli nje loo mbuzo.
We want to see more of that.	Sifuna ukubona ngakumbi oko.
I had no idea what.	Ndandingazi ngantoni .
Dinner.	Ukutya ebusuku.
He certainly looked like he would.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayekhangeleka ngathi uya kuba njalo.
This is exactly what happened.	Oku kwenzeka kanye ngolo hlobo.
I'm tired of being in pain.	Ndidiniwe kukuba buhlungu.
He said it is very difficult.	Uthe kunzima kakhulu.
We know you think of us that way.	Siyazi ukuba ucinga ngathi ngolo hlobo.
After that, all will go well.	Emva koko, konke kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
He knew a lot about her.	Wayesazi kakhulu ngaye.
Or too small.	Okanye encinci kakhulu.
And later the meat.	Kwaye kamva inyama.
Just a few days together.	Iintsuku nje ezimbalwa kunye.
Is it difficult.	Ngaba kunzima .
He agreed to come to her.	Wavuma ukuba eze kuye.
But that is exactly what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka loo nto kanye.
It seems like a lot of work right now.	Kubonakala ngathi umsebenzi kakhulu ngoku.
I don't know why really.	Andazi kutheni ngenene.
He does not have to try hard.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba azame ngamandla.
Now it is very difficult.	Ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
Or a lamp.	Okanye isibane.
All of this is good and right.	Konke oku kulungile kwaye kulungile.
And now you know almost the whole story.	Kwaye ngoku uyazi phantse lonke ibali.
You won one.	Uphumelele enye.
That way and that way.	Ngaloo ndlela kwaye ngaloo ndlela.
But he is not always.	Kodwa akakho njalo.
I would really like your help in this.	Ndingathanda kakhulu uncedo lwakho kule nto.
He is here right now.	Ukhona kanye ngoku.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu .
He looks much better now.	Ukhangeleka engcono kakhulu ngoku.
I thought that was probably a good thing.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
True, he did not.	Yinyani, akenzanga.
I wanted to know where he was.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba uphi.
Stop talking now.	Yeka ukuthetha ngoku.
Not a very good answer.	Hayi impendulo entle kakhulu.
Yes and you know it.	Ewe kwaye uyazi.
I'm not so sad now.	Andikho buhlungu kangako ngoku.
He said he wanted to help.	Wathi ufuna ukunceda.
Who is the son.	Ngubani unyana.
He knew he knew nothing about her.	Wayesazi ukuba wayengazi nto ngaye.
But you know you won't do anything.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
No matter how out.	Nokuba ngaphandle kangakanani.
In the end, it was not that hard.	Ekugqibeleni, akuzange kube nzima kangako.
You will have to wait.	Kuza kufuneka ulinde.
Not every little thing.	Hayi yonke into encinci nje.
As well,   .	Njengokuba, .
I could not go to school.	Andikwazanga ukuya esikolweni.
Nothing before.	Akukho nto ngaphambili.
I can do better here alone.	Ndingayenza ngcono apha ndedwa.
Just trying to think.	Ukuzama nje ukucinga.
But this time it was not so.	Kodwa ngeli xesha akuzange kube njalo.
Slowly, no.	Kancinci, hayi.
And we will see if that is so.	Kwaye siza kubona ukuba kunjalo.
I don’t know what I did, though.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni, nangona kunjalo.
Well, of course, one has to have it.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, umntu kufuneka abe nayo.
He stayed to help us.	Wahlala ukuze asincede.
He hadn’t done such a thing in a long time, though.	Akazange enze into enjalo ixesha elide, nangona kunjalo.
She is trying to move slowly.	Uzama ukuhamba kancinci.
I can't be alone, either.	Andikwazi ukuba ndedwa, nam.
I really need your help.	Ndifuna uncedo lwakho nyani.
But he is afraid again.	Kodwa woyika kwakhona.
He had to leave, and soon.	Kwafuneka ahambe, kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
Now it will be more difficult.	Ngoku kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He wants us to be together.	Ufuna sibe kunye.
I would, however.	Ndingathanda, nangona kunjalo.
It happened then.	Kwenzeka ngoko.
There is no need for more.	Akukho mfuneko ngakumbi.
Very, very, very beautiful.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, mhle kakhulu.
Let me see, see, see.	Makhe ndibone, ndibone, ndibone.
Not just to me, but to all of us.	Hayi kum kuphela, kodwa kuthi sonke.
That seemed to do it.	Oko kwakubonakala ngathi kukwenza.
Tell other people.	Xelela abanye abantu.
Everyone always talks about him, you know.	Wonke umntu uhlala ethetha ngaye, uyazi.
Or no one will do it.	Okanye akukho mntu uya kwenza.
But there was no one, of course.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu, kunjalo.
You are sure to like this place.	Uqinisekile ukuba uyayithanda le ndawo.
In fact .	Inyaniso .
If you want to come.	Ukuba ufuna ukuza.
There is no place to sit down.	Akukho ndawo yokuhlala phantsi.
You do not want to know.	Awufuni ukwazi.
Or smaller.	Okanye encinci.
Maybe I will.	Mhlawumbi ndiya kwenza njalo.
They'll just go.	Baza kuhamba nje.
He could not take over the house.	Akazange akwazi ukuthatha indlu.
You've been out of me, you know.	Ukhe waphuma kum, uyazi.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andiyi.
But he may well have thought so.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayecinga .
As it should be.	Njengoko kufuneka kube njalo.
Before something else happened.	Ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke enye into.
Or, so again, maybe not.	Okanye, ngoko kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
There was nothing else.	Kwakungekho enye into .
I do not have to wait.	Akufuneki ndilinde.
He is like that with every little thing.	Unjalo ngayo yonke into encinci.
So, thank you very much.	Ngoko, enkosi kakhulu.
A little bit maybe.	Kancinci kancinci mhlawumbi.
If not, then everything is fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngoko yonke into ilungile.
Not everyone does.	Hayi wonke umntu kunjalo.
I would not want too much.	Andiyi kufuna kakhulu.
Something strange to me.	Into engaqhelekanga kum.
But anyone.	Kodwa nabani na.
Well not quite.	Kulungile hayi ngokupheleleyo.
So with everything.	Ngoko nayo yonke into.
Look at me .	Ndijonge .
She just knew she loved it.	Wayesazi nje ukuba uyayithanda.
He wants to go see his mother.	Ufuna ukuya kubona umama wakhe.
Is that clear.	Ngaba oko kucacile.
Yeah, all right now.	Ewe, konke kulungile ngoku.
Everyone wants their own place.	Wonke umntu ufuna indawo yakhe.
Then, it will be more difficult.	Emva koko, kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
Every day we want to get better.	Yonke imihla sifuna ukuba ngcono.
Well, as soon as possible, don't you think? 	Ewe, ngokukhawuleza kangangoko kunokwenzeka, awucingi?
I will repeat that.	Ndiya kuphinda oko.
To do it this way.	Ukwenza ngale ndlela.
Or how fast.	Okanye ngokukhawuleza kangakanani.
And everyone who comes after that.	Kwaye wonke umntu oza emva koko.
I want you to dress the same tomorrow.	Ndifuna unxibe ngendlela efanayo ngomso.
But nobody ever lived there.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakha wahlala apho.
I look forward to doing that.	Ndilinde ukwenza oko.
No, he understood.	Hayi, waqonda.
I think we both really are.	Ndicinga ukuba sobabini ngokwenene.
You need to know why.	Kufuneka uyazi ukuba kutheni.
But he had to do it.	Kodwa ke kwafuneka enjenjalo.
But there is something strange about him today.	Kodwa kukho into engaqhelekanga ngaye namhlanje.
But it will be tonight.	Kodwa kuya kuba njalo ngokuhlwanje.
He is sure to be back soon.	Uqinisekile ukuba uza kubuya kungekudala.
Not so in this case, and everyone knew it.	Akunjalo kule meko, kwaye wonke umntu wayesazi.
It is a long time to do this.	Lixesha elide ukwenza oku.
All, absolutely.	Bonke, ngokupheleleyo.
Not just play.	Hayi nje ukudlala.
I want to stay for two weeks.	Ndifuna indawo yokuhlala iiveki ezimbini.
This will be good for both of us.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle kuthi sobabini.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho enye into ayifunayo.
I look at it all for me.	Ndijonge ukuba konke kum.
Getting to it though.	Ukufika kuyo nangona kunjalo.
We know we need to.	Siyazi ukuba kufuneka.
Then he does something strange.	Emva koko wenza into engaqhelekanga.
But maybe not with him.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi naye.
Two hours or not at all.	Iiyure ezimbini okanye akukho kwaphela.
No, don't play.	Hayi, musa ukudlala.
Really.	Ngokwenene .
Some say.	Abanye bathi .
Maybe we don’t, though.	Mhlawumbi asiyi, nangona kunjalo.
Tell me how you are doing.	Ndixelele ukuba uqhuba njani.
I will not dwell in it.	andiyi kuhlala kuyo.
And in a good way.	Kwaye ngendlela elungileyo.
He will leave soon.	Uya kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I want more for my children.	Ndifuna ngakumbi abantwana bam.
He certainly can sing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyakwazi ukucula.
She is not at school.	Akakho esikolweni.
My father is a good man.	Utata ungumntu olungileyo.
So he did.	Ngoko wayenza.
No you have.	Hayi unayo.
Maybe they will do it someday.	Mhlawumbi baya kukwenza ngenye imini.
He doesn't want to be there.	Akafuni ukuba lapho.
I want more.	Ndifuna ngakumbi .
And you can do the same for yourself.	Kwaye ungayenza loo nto nawe.
He came forward.	Weza ngaphambili.
And what happened next? 	Kwaye kwenzeka ntoni emva koko?
I can't wait to meet you.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukudibana nawe.
I hope something happens to that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuloo nto.
What needs to be done.	Yintoni ekufuneka yenziwe.
Big money here.	Imali enkulu apha.
But you, once.	Kodwa wena, kanye.
And, more so.	Kwaye, ngakumbi.
This has happened again and again.	Oku kuye kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
No one will be with me.	Akukho mntu uya kuba nam.
You're gone too.	Nawe uhambe .
But he would get one.	Kodwa wayeza kufumana enye.
And so we want to stay here.	Kwaye ke sifuna ukuhlala apha.
If one is able to work, it is necessary.	Ukuba umntu uyakwazi ukusebenza, kufuneka.
We never did that.	Zange siyenze loo nto.
We were never that far away.	Asizange sibe kude kangako.
I have never been before.	Andizange ndibe ngaphambili.
I think you know that about me.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi lonto ngam.
No one gave me a job though.	Akukho mntu wandinika umsebenzi nangona kunjalo.
So this is right here.	Ngoko oku kanye apha.
The food in the restaurant is good.	Ukutya kwindawo yokutyela kulungile.
As with us.	Njengoko ngathi.
A little over a month.	Kancinci kwinyanga.
Not always, of course, but always.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kunjalo, kodwa rhoqo.
But you can't take a chance.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuthatha ithuba.
It doesn't have to mean anything.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kuthetha nto.
He would stay with me.	Wayeza kuhlala nam.
You have to do that more than once.	Kufuneka wenze oko ngaphezu kwexesha elinye.
I can't speak anymore.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kwakhona.
But enough for us.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ngathi.
I have spoken ill.	Ndithethe kakubi.
I think about him, too, you know.	Ndicinga ngaye, naye, uyazi.
And he did it with vigor.	Kwaye wenza ngamandla.
I'm afraid which one.	Ndiyoyika ukuba yeyiphi.
You know exactly what you are talking about.	Uyazi ngokucacileyo ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
It will take time, too.	Kuya kufuneka ngexesha, kwakhona.
So far, obviously.	Kuze kube ngoku, ngokucacileyo.
Look up.	Jonga phezulu.
And it all takes three years.	Kwaye konke kuthatha iminyaka emithathu.

You want to do this.	Ufuna ukwenza oku.
Play is possible for a long time.	Ukudlala kunokwenzeka ixesha elide.
You can find out later.	Uyakwazi ukufumana emva koko.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko ke.
There is nothing I can do well.	Akukho nto ndingayenza kakuhle.
But not now, not today.	Kodwa hayi ngoku, hayi namhlanje.
I want that too.	Nam ndifuna lonto.
Or yes.	Okanye ewe.
And time after that.	Kwaye ixesha emva koko.
One person did.	Umntu omnye wenza.
I thought you were going.	Bendicinga ukuba uya .

For now, however, there is a problem.	Okwangoku, nangona kunjalo, kukho ingxaki.
Problem doctor.	Ingxaki ugqirha.
Maybe he'll be back soon.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kubuya kungekudala.
After that, he will go to work.	Emva koko, uya kuya emsebenzini.
There is no danger for you here.	Akukho ngozi kuwe apha.
But he could not do it, no more.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza, hayi ngakumbi.
Man does his work, and his work alone.	Umntu wenza umsebenzi wakhe, kwaye umsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
So there is a chance here.	Ke kukho ithuba apha.
So that goes.	Ngoko ke oko kuhamba.
We have been traveling for a very long time.	Sihambe ixesha elide kakhulu.
You know there's something wrong with that.	Ubusazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga kuloo nto.
He never got there.	Akazange afike apho.
He looked at everything very quickly.	Uye wajonga yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
I think you have it in the wrong way.	Ndicinga ukuba unayo ngendlela engalunganga.
She wanted to have children with him.	Wayefuna ukuba nabantwana kunye naye.
Maybe in bed.	Mhlawumbi ebhedini.
He gave me a gun, too.	Wandinika umpu, nam.
Our work remains the same.	Umsebenzi wethu uhlala ufana.

Now everyone knows everything.	Ngoku wonke umntu uyazi yonke into.
We want every single mind.	Sifuna yonke ingqondo enye.
You may be busy.	Unokuba uxakekile.
I didn't really know.	Ndandingazi ngenene.
He would wait until tomorrow.	Wayeza kulinda de kube ngomso.
It was as if he had told her everything.	Kwakubonakala ngathi umxelele yonke into.
And he comes home.	Kwaye uza ekhaya.
I didn't know what it was.	Bendingazi ukuba yintoni na.
I also ask for help.	Nam ndicela uncedo.
But this is a big deal.	Kodwa le yinto enkulu.
He wants you to come after him.	Ufuna ukuba uze emva kwakhe.
Well, you know when.	Kulungile, uyazi ukuba nini.
You can get better.	Unokuba ngcono.
But no such situation exists.	Kodwa akukho meko enjalo eyenzekayo.

To do with you.	Ukwenza nawe.
I hope you do better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuyenza ngcono.
And maybe he will come again.	Kwaye mhlawumbi uya kuza kwakhona.

His work.	Umsebenzi wakhe .
We have known this for many years.	Siyazi le nto iminyaka emininzi.
He looked now.	Wajonga ngoku .
And she's beautiful, of course.	Kwaye mhle, kunjalo.
And you.	Nam wena.
With everything that happens.	Ngayo yonke into eyenzekayo.
It will be fast.	Iya kuba ngokukhawuleza.
And we should, because it is.	Kwaye sifanele, kuba kunjalo.
Please keep thinking about us.	Nceda uhlale ucinga ngathi.
This really shows when you think about it.	Oku kubonakala ngokwenene xa ucinga ngayo.
Not to be too low on it.	Hayi ukuba phantsi kakhulu kuyo.
That's really strange.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ngokwenene leyo.
I saw a woman.	Ndabona umfazi.
He did not stay after that.	Akazange ahlale emva koko.
Or someone else, for that matter.	Okanye komnye umntu, ngaloo nto.
If not, probably not.	Ukuba akunjalo, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He too did his best.	Naye wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
No, of course not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo impazamo.
But now he has done it.	Kodwa ngoku uyenzile loo nto.
He made a door.	Wenza ucango.
I can't say that for myself.	Andikwazi ukuyithetha ngokwam lonto.
Just talking as it is.	Ukuthetha nje njengoko kunjalo.
But that is not the case now.	Kodwa akunjalo ngoku.
I couldn't think of anything else.	Andikwazanga ukucinga ngenye into.
I don't know where your dog is.	Andazi ukuba iphi inja yakho.
You want to do some things.	Ufuna ukwenza ezinye izinto.
He said he had to stay home to study.	Wathi kufuneka ahlale ekhaya ukuze afunde.
I have to do some.	Kufuneka ndenze ezinye.
It needs to be done quickly.	Kufuneka yenziwe ngokukhawuleza.
And then one thing, and then another.	Kwaye ke enye into, kwaye ke enye.
We are going there.	Siya apho.
Then, he asked loudly.	Emva koko, wabuza phezulu.
All right, please.	Kulungile, nceda.
Some have lived there.	Abanye baye bahlala apho.
I will be back more.	Ndiza kubuya ngakumbi.
Yes, it is a very long time.	Ewe, lixesha elide kakhulu.
Only at school.	Kuphela esikolweni.
Eventually, he had to leave.	Ekugqibeleni, kwafuneka ahambe.
There is no need for me to speak again.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndiphinde ndithethe.
He's only been here for a week.	Ulapha iveki kuphela.
I had to do it again.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze kwakhona.
It's really my job.	Ngumsebenzi wam ngokwenene.
Or I tried to stop doing anything.	Okanye ndazama ukuyeka ukwenza nantoni na.
That's what needs to be done.	Yinto ekufuneka yenziwe.
And it.	Kwaye yona .
Taking his chance.	Ukuthatha ithuba lakhe.
He did not say anything about it.	Akazange axelele nantoni na ngaloo nto.
As it is here.	Njengokuba kunjalo apha.
He didn't have to pretend to be interested.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze ngathi unomdla.
Everyone is trying to take everyone.	Wonke umntu uzama ukuthatha wonke umntu.
I will not do it tomorrow.	Andiyi kuyenza ngomso.
Not with us.	Hayi kunye nathi.
He knew he would continue with it.	Wayesazi ukuba uza kuqhubeka nayo.
And now, ourselves.	Kwaye ngoku, ngokwethu.
There is no food in the room.	Akukho kutya egumbini.
I will say this a lot.	Ndiza kuthetha oku kakhulu.
It makes life.	Kwenza ubomi.
Performance is almost impossible.	Ukusebenza phantse akunakwenzeka.
Or no, maybe not.	Okanye hayi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Not like me and you.	Hayi njengam nawe.
It also has to be fast.	Kwakhona kufuneka kube ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want to cause trouble.	Andifuni ukwenza ingxaki.
That will make my job a lot easier.	Oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wam ube lula kakhulu.
I read, it seems.	Ndifunde, kubonakala ngathi.
I know, because he told me about it before.	Ndiyazi, kuba wandixelela ngayo ngaphambili.
If, if, if.	Ukuba, ukuba, ukuba .
I had no idea who it might be.	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba ngubani.
Do not work these.	Musa ukusebenza ezi.
Great book.	Incwadi enkulu.
Do not work that way.	Musa ukusebenza ngaloo ndlela.
Your mother doesn't like that.	Umama wakho akayithandi loo nto.
And only for me.	Kwaye kum kuphela.
But you did the right thing.	Kodwa wenze into elungileyo.
Then something else happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka enye into.
We didn't go then.	Asizange sihambe ngoko.
This time, together.	Ngeli xesha, kunye.
I don’t know why, though.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, nangona kunjalo.
Efficiency is everything.	Ukusebenza kakuhle yinto yonke.
Help other people, don't help others.	Nceda abanye abantu, musa ukunceda abanye.
Yes, he is really good.	Ewe, ulungile ngokwenene.
This is what you told me.	Le nto undixelele yona.
But if you really look at this.	Kodwa ukuba ngokwenene ujonge le.
Or for now, of course.	Okanye okwangoku, kunjalo.
This has had to happen.	Oku kuye kwafuneka kube njalo.
I am my voice.	Ndim ilizwi lam.
Another slept in his car.	Omnye walala emotweni yakhe.
All right, that's fine.	Kulungile, oko kulungile.
You know you will continue.	Uyazi ukuba uza kuqhubeka.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto .
You think about it a lot.	Ucinga ngayo kakhulu.
I was the first to arrive.	Ndibe ngowokuqala ukufika.
I didn't want to do it.	Bendingafuni ukuyenza.
I came for work.	Ndize ngomsebenzi.
There was nothing to do with us otherwise.	Kwakungekho nto ukwenza ngathi ngenye indlela.
I do a lot here.	Ndiyenza kakhulu apha.
But it is difficult to do otherwise.	Kodwa kunzima ukwenza ngaphandle koko.
So, please come home.	Ngoko ke, nceda uze ekhaya.
It's just that it's hard.	Kuphela nje ukuba kunzima.
He still lives.	Uhlala nangoku.
There is no stopping.	Akukho ukuyeka.
No talking.	Akukho ukuthetha .
It was not our time to be.	Kwakungekho xesha lethu lokuba.
So everyone left.	Ngoko wonke umntu wahamba.
That should definitely be.	Oko kufuneka ngokuqinisekileyo.
I thought about him a lot lately.	Bendicinga ngaye kakhulu mva nje.
I wonder how he knew.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba wayesazi njani.
And we need to do that.	Kwaye kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
He was wearing a nice shirt.	Wayenxibe ihempe entle.
The whole place is everything, it seems to us.	Indawo yonke into, kubonakala ngathi.
I would like to see that too.	Ndingathanda ukubona oko nam.
You don't have to come now.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uze ngoku.
Almost here.	Phantse apha.
We'll be back tomorrow somehow.	Siza kubuya ngomso ngenye indlela.
Just last night.	Phezolo nje.
And then he went completely away.	Kwaye emva koko wahamba ngokupheleleyo.
And again this morning.	Ke kwakhona ngale ntsasa.
I don't want to hear from you again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndive kuwe.
It seemed to go nowhere.	Kwakubonakala ukuba akuyi ndawo.
If it has been necessary.	Ukuba kuye kwafuneka.
One day back.	Ngenye imini emva.
I thought of doing it my way.	Ndacinga ukwenza ngendlela yam.
I just think.	Ndiyacinga nje.
Once you've done that, you'll see why.	Nje ukuba uyenzile, uya kubona ukuba kutheni.
This is what it means to be human.	Oku koko kuthetha ukuba ngumntu.
We will go first.	Siza kuhamba kuqala.
I live there for a very long time.	Ndihlala apho ixesha elide kakhulu.
I really couldn’t go there.	Ngenene andikwazanga ukuya apho.
I couldn't find a bike.	Andikwazanga ukufumana ibhayisekile.
I thought she was very beautiful.	Bendicinga ukuba mhle kakhulu.
Making a speech.	Ukwenza intetho.
Do not do this.	Musa ukuyenza le nto .
That's what this place is for.	Yiloo nto le ndawo.
You know, a little talk.	Uyazi, intetho encinci.
I'm human now.	Ndingumntu ngoku.
So with us.	Ngoko kunye nathi.
I will do anything, please.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na, nceda.
No, they did not.	Hayi, abazange.
You should be asleep by now.	Bekufanele ukuba ulele ngoku.
We have known it very well for many years.	Siyazi kakuhle kakhulu iminyaka emininzi.
In this case, there is none.	Kule meko, akukho.
It should be a little harder.	Kufuneka kube nzima kancinci.
I can't stop talking about you.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukuthetha ngawe.
But just another girl.	Kodwa enye intombi nje.
I don't really know how.	Andazi ngokwenene ukuba njani.
That's right, that's fine.	Kunjalo, kulungile.
Not yet, perhaps not at all.	Hayi okwangoku, mhlawumbi hayi kwaphela.
Please, you should tell me.	Nceda, kufuneka undixelele.
I will not go far.	Andiyi kuya kude.
But what is it?	Kodwa yintoni na?
I'm thinking about this.	Ndicinga ngale nto.
He saw that.	Wabona kunjalo.
There is no reality here.	Akukho nyani apha.
Well, it certainly does not have to be.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo akufuneki ukuba kube njalo.
I don't see anything out now.	Andiboni nto ngaphandle ngoku.
I am here to tell you the truth.	Ndilapha ukuze ndikuxelele inyaniso.
There is only you and me here.	Kukho mna nawe kuphela apha.
He asked a little.	Wacela kancinci.
I wanted to know how it happened, what happened.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke njani, ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I want to see .	Ndifuna ukubona .
He wasn't really.	Wayengekho nyani.
It will be much easier to read.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukufunda.
It should, however.	Bekufanele, nangona kunjalo.
He had to go.	Bekufanele ahambe.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Kungcono ukuba uyazi ngoku kunokuba kamva.
He also does not like it.	Naye akayithandi.
I went strong.	Ndaya ngamandla.
There was just no other way.	Kwakungekho nje enye indlela.
And he knew nothing at all.	Kwaye wayengazi nto konke konke.
My wife asked why.	Umfazi wam wabuza ukuba kutheni.
You have to talk.	Kufuneka uthethe.
Really fast.	Ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
If something happens.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
Traveling alone.	Ukuhamba yedwa.
As he spoke, he looked around at the restaurant.	Njengoko wayethetha, wajonga kwindawo yokutyela.
What a picture.	Yintoni umfanekiso.
I will not continue.	Andiyi kuqhubeka.
I'm just scared.	Ndiyoyika nje.
I can't speak right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha okwangoku.
It is very difficult to do, this.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza, oku.
I didn't see which one.	Khange ndibone ukuba yeyiphi.
You do not have to do anything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze nantoni na.
You will talk to me.	Uza kuthetha nam.
He felt like talking.	Waziva efuna ukuthetha.
Alone, you live alone.	Wedwa, uhlala wedwa.
And, well, you know what happens next.	Kwaye, ke, uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
He told me exactly this, a long time ago.	Wandixelela oku kanye, kudala kakhulu.
How strange it is.	Hayi indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo.
I hope it goes well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iza kuhamba kakuhle.
Even a small thing.	Nokuba yinto nje encinci.
We'll talk about it again.	Siza kuthetha ngayo kwakhona.
Maybe she would love her son.	Mhlawumbi angathanda unyana wakhe.
Not just a good message.	Hayi nje umyalezo olungileyo.
Please, let me tell her.	Nceda, ndimxelele.
That's my place.	Nantso indawo yam.
He does not have to know everything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba azi yonke into.
I'm afraid I'm alone here.	Ndiyoyika ukuba ndedwa apha.
He learned a lot.	Wafunda okuninzi.
Eventually that will end.	Ekugqibeleni oko kuya kuphela.
Then he opened his eyes.	Emva koko wavula amehlo akhe.
He sat right next to her.	Wahlala kanye ecaleni kwakhe.
Looks like you're going to get great with that.	Kubonakala ngathi uya kufumana enkulu ngaloo nto.
Shouldn't you.	Akufanele na wena .
Not just to you, but to me.	Hayi nje kuwe, kodwa kum.
I'm the one who wants to know.	Ndim lo ufuna ukwazi.
The problem is power.	Ingxaki ngamandla.
You have your number.	Unayo inombolo yakho.
We did not go long.	Khange sihambe ixesha elide.
You cannot make everyone be like you.	Awunako ukwenza wonke umntu abe njengawe.
Anything else.	Nantoni na enye.
But that is our job.	Kodwa ngumsebenzi wethu lowo.
The book for sure.	Incwadi ngokuqinisekileyo.
I mean for sure.	Ndithetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
Now it will.	Ngoku iya kwenza njalo.
I can't walk fast.	Andikwazi kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I'm starting to walk.	Ndiyaqala ukuhamba.
Nothing, nothing at all.	Akukho nto, konke akukho nto.
In my bedroom.	Kwigumbi lam lokulala.
I'm glad it's coming here now.	Ndiyavuya ukuba iza apha ngoku.
I know how to do this.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
You better look.	Kungcono ujonge.
However you should only be with me.	Nangona kunjalo kufuneka ube kunye nam kuphela.
I don't have one.	Andinayo enye.
I told him the number.	Ndamxelela inombolo.
I would love to have it again.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo kwakhona.
He took my car, though.	Wathatha imoto yam, nangona kunjalo.
I don't have to talk.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndithethe.
There was no work.	Kwakungekho msebenzi.
He hoped to get better.	Wayenethemba lokuba ngcono.
You read in the room.	Ufunda egumbini.
Help someone to sit down.	Nceda umntu ahlale.
It's okay to be angry.	Kulungile ukuba nomsindo.
I did well.	ndenze kulungile.
And then he really died.	Kwaye ke wafa ngokwenene.
Again, very slowly, very late.	Kwakhona, kancinci kakhulu, emva kwexesha kakhulu.
Maybe you won't.	Mhlawumbi awuyi .
Both will get a lot.	Bobabini baya kufumana okuninzi.
He became everything to me.	Waba yinto yonke kum.
Death should be instantaneous.	Ukufa kumele ukuba kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
He did not think so.	Wayengacingi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Mom will get help.	UMama uya kufumana uncedo.
This will be difficult later.	Oku kuya kuba nzima emva kwexesha.
No, obviously not.	Hayi, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
There is another problem.	Kwakhona kukho enye ingxaki.
It will be a little difficult.	Iza kuba nzima kancinci.
I'm glad you feel better !.	Ndiyavuya uziva ngcono!.
My dad told me the other day.	Utata wandixelela ngenye imini.
Today, he will do it for you.	Namhlanje, uya kukwenza kuwe.
Nobody likes to travel.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukuhamba.
She wanted to be with her children.	Wayefuna ukuba kunye nabantwana bakhe.
You cannot make someone successful.	Awukwazi ukwenza umntu aphumelele.
Yes, good work.	Ewe, umsebenzi olungileyo.
I have been thinking since yesterday.	Bendicinga ukusukela izolo.
He started trying.	Waqalisa ukuzama.
But still on the sidelines.	Kodwa nangoku ecaleni.
It can be hard to tell who she is.	Kunokuba nzima ukuxelela ukuba ngubani.
Please come and sit down.	Ndicela uze uhlale phantsi.
Absolutely sure.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngokuqinisekileyo.
Not bad, really.	Hayi kakubi, ngokwenene.
I don’t really know what to do with it though.	Andazi ngenene ukuba enze ntoni ngayo nangona kunjalo.
And more.	Kwaye ngakumbi.
He learned.	Wafunda .
He will need his help.	Uya kufuna uncedo lwakhe.
He once said.	Wakhe wathi .
But whoever, he does a good job.	Kodwa nabani na lowo, wenza umsebenzi omhle.
Not so much a woman, though.	Hayi kakhulu umfazi, nangona.
It's a great thing to have.	Yinto enkulu ukuba nayo.
I just wanted to help.	Ndandifuna nje ukunceda.
He tried desperately to think of something he wanted to say.	Wazama ngamandla ukucinga ngento afuna ukuyithetha.
I never thought about it.	Zange ndicinge ngayo.
One wants money fast.	Omnye unqwenela imali ngokukhawuleza.
Dad is scared.	UTata woyika.
And he stayed with me that way.	Waza wahlala nam ngolo hlobo.
I don't think you do.	Andiqondi ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
I'm not sure the question.	Andiqinisekanga umbuzo.
Before my time.	Ngaphambi kwexesha lam.
This, however, is currently not possible.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, okwangoku akunakwenzeka.
Finally someone spoke.	Ekugqibeleni umntu wathetha.
Now he is not visible to everyone.	Ngoku akabonakali kuye wonke umntu.
This is good at the top.	Oku kulungile phezulu.
It means to work.	Kuthetha ukusebenza.
Maybe I'm more than you.	Mhlawumbi mna ngaphezu kwakho.
And this is something new.	Kwaye le yinto entsha.
He never really did anything.	Akazange enze nto ngokwenene.
You have to be your own person.	Kufuneka ube ngumntu wakho.
Just a little, a little.	Kancinci nje, kancinci.
I have never been in one place so much.	Andizange ndihlale kwindawo enye kakhulu.
Not you, sorry.	Hayi nawe, uxolo.
Well maybe you should.	Kulungile mhlawumbi ufanele.
I'm afraid to speak.	Ndiyoyika ukuthetha.
He did a lot of things very quickly.	Wenze into eninzi ngokukhawuleza.
He lay down.	Walala phantsi.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange enjenjalo.
There was nobody here.	Kwakungekho mntu apha.
Probably the whole thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto yonke.
You know, or alcohol or something.	Uyazi, okanye utywala okanye into.
He felt how hard it was for him.	Waziva ukuba kunzima kangakanani kuye.
It would be for me now.	Bekuya kuba kum ngoku.
This, again, is not my problem.	Oku, kwakhona, hayi ingxaki yam.
You don't have to tell me anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba undixelele nantoni na.
None of us do until he is in that situation.	Akukho namnye kuthi owenza de abe kuloo meko.
He had to make things very difficult.	Kwafuneka enze izinto nzima kakhulu.
So, you will have to look at this book.	Ke ngoko, kuya kufuneka ujonge le ncwadi.
Learning to read.	Ukufunda ukufunda.
He is afraid of everyone and everything.	Woyika wonke umntu nayo yonke into.
For one thing, he says that he did not do it.	Enye into, uthi akazange ayenze.
He never came home.	Akazange afike ekhaya.
I want you to do this alone.	Ndifuna uyenze wedwa lento.
I know a little bit.	Ndiyazi kancinci.
I can't think of anything else.	Andikwazi ukucinga enye into.
Although this is very difficult.	Nangona oku kunzima kakhulu.
He certainly spent the night.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wachitha ubusuku.
There was nothing here.	Kwakungekho nto apha.
He did not approve of anyone.	Akazange avume mntu.
And a bike.	Kwaye ibhayisekile .
I can't stop doing something else right now.	Andikwazi ukuyeka ukwenza enye into ngoku.
He heard something else.	Weva enye into.
Money, no money, that's fine for me.	Imali, akukho mali, kulungile kum.
This is not fun.	Oku akukho mnandi.
And all night.	Kwaye ubusuku bonke.
Not for him, but for him.	Hayi kuye, kodwa kunye naye.
In all of this.	Kuyo yonke le nto.
Yes, that's fine.	Ewe, kuhle.
I will be alone then.	Ndiya kuba ndedwa ngoko.
I will make it very easy here.	Ndiza kwenza kube lula kakhulu apha.
As you know what we need to do here.	Njengoko uyazi ukuba kufuneka senze ntoni apha.
Eventually we will get there.	Ekugqibeleni siza kufika apho.
It could be either way.	Inokuba yiyo nayiphi na indlela.
It's not the same thing.	Asiyonto enye.
After that, it wasn’t much time.	Emva koko, kwakungekho ixesha elininzi.
Maybe the kids will go with it.	Mhlawumbi abantwana baya kuhamba kunye nayo.
He did, too, in the end.	Uyenzile, naye, ekugqibeleni.
Look at the restaurant.	Jonga kwindawo yokutyela.
In this way.	Ngolu hlobo.
This is a strange thing to do.	Le yinto engaqhelekanga ukuba ayenze.
There is always the opportunity to make money.	Kuhlala kukho ithuba lokwenza imali.
He just wanted to help.	Wayefuna ukunceda kuphela.
It comes together.	Iza kunye.
No, he is not with me.	Hayi lo uhamba nam.
Not his wife, but his daughter.	Hayi umfazi wakhe, kodwa intombi yakhe.
He said he did not think so.	Wathi khange acinge njalo.
I live alone, really alone.	Ndihlala ndedwa, ngokwenene ndedwa.
It hasn't happened yet.	Ayizange yenzeke kude kube ngoku.
But all of that is coming next week.	Kodwa konke oko kuza kwiveki ezayo.
And who wants to.	Kwaye ngubani ofuna.
It is made of strength.	Yenziwe ngamandla.
I can't help you with that.	Andikwazi ukukunceda ngaloo nto.
I don't have to be here to do it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndibe lapha ukuze ndiyenze.
As you live up there.	Njengoko uhlala phaya phezulu.
I have to go to work tonight.	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini namhlanje ebusuku.
Although man.	Nangona umntu.
So this will definitely happen.	Ngoko oku kuya kwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo.
Then wait.	Emva koko ulinde.
It's really clear.	Kucacile ngokwenene.
And there was no later.	Kwaye kwakungekho mva.
And so it is today.	Kwaye kunjalo namhlanje.
He certainly did not look that way now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengabonakali ngolo hlobo ngoku.
We will have to do it ourselves.	Kuya kufuneka siyenze ngokwethu.
But it will be very fun.	Kodwa kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
He knew it would be easy.	Wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba lula.
Great week.	Iveki enkulu.
My mother did it.	Umama uyenzile.
I’ll have to wait a bit, though.	Kuza kufuneka ndilinde kancinci, nangona kunjalo.
And if you win.	Kwaye ukuba uphumelele .
That is exactly what happened.	Ngokwenene, kwenzeka loo nto.
I never thought it was that far.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kude kangako.
She is happy too.	Naye uyavuya ngoku.
The truth is, we need your help.	Inyaniso kukuba, sifuna uncedo lwakho.
He said sorry.	Wathi uxolo.
And no one wants to talk about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Here and now, he knew nothing.	Apha kwaye ngoku, wayengazi nto.
And again for a week.	Kwaye kwakhona kwiveki.
See what you do outside.	Jonga ukuba wenza ntoni ngaphandle.
I don't think it will do anything.	Andiqondi ukuba iya kwenza nto.
I have no time and, now, money.	Andinaxesha kwaye, ngoku, imali.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi nje le.
This is a very unusual thing.	Le yinto engaqhelekanga kwaphela.
And he was just talking about work.	Kwaye wayethetha nje ngomsebenzi.
The message just does not appear.	Umyalezo awubonakali nje.
Also, you probably know how to do this.	Kwakhona, mhlawumbi uyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
You're better with me.	Ungcono kunye nam.
I did that today.	Ndenze loo nto namhlanje.
If you want, give it to me.	Ukuba uyafuna, ndinike.
And you made it fun.	Kwaye wenze ukuba kube mnandi.
That is the first task.	Ngumsebenzi wokuqala lowo.
He made everyone go.	Wenza wonke umntu ukuba ahambe.
So, it could be.	Ngoko, inokuba njalo.
Very human.	Kakhulu umntu.
Thank you all.	Enkosi lonke.
It can be strange.	Unokuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
I never knew who did that.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ngubani owenze loo nto.
Everyone went without me.	Wonke umntu waya ngaphandle kwam.
There is a case.	Kukho ityala.
He can't do it.	Akakwazi ukuyenza.
No, he will have to stay in it.	Hayi, kuya kufuneka ahlale kuyo.
And he doesn't know that.	Kwaye akayazi loo nto.
And that's just it, he said.	Kwaye kunjalo nje, wathi.
I couldn't help but think of that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ukucinga ngaloo nto.
For me, there is no time at all.	Kum, akukho xesha konke konke.
He has to learn to be alone.	Kufuneka afunde ukuba yedwa.
This makes everything difficult.	Oku kwenza ukuba konke kube nzima.
He told me himself yesterday.	Undixelele ngokwakhe izolo.
It's a big deal for him.	Yinto enkulu kuye.
He just got home.	Wafika nje ekhaya.
But he was hopeful.	Kodwa wayenethemba.
All right, please.	Kulungile, siza.
Today he would succeed.	Namhlanje wayeza kuphumelela.
Maybe he wanted alcohol.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna utywala.
You won immediately.	Uphumelele ngoko nangoko.
It was not necessary for anyone to do that.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba umntu enze oko.
He tried to do it again, slowly.	Wazama ukuyenza kwakhona, kancinci.
Tomorrow is her wedding.	Ngomso umtshato wakhe.
I'm sorry about that.	Ndiyaxolisa ngayo.
More than you knew.	Ngakumbi kunokuba ubusazi.
Who will he be.	Uya kuba ngubani.
I'm sure it's good for both of us.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kulungile kuthi sobabini.
They will be here soon.	Baza kuba apha kungekudala.
He pulled out a book first.	Wakhupha incwadi kuqala.
That's what it looks like.	Yiloo nto ebonakala ngathi.
He said he almost did.	Uthe uphantse wayenza.
But still, he came home to me.	Kodwa kunjalo, weza ekhaya kum.
No one was there.	Akukho mntu wayengekho.
Yes this will take time.	Ewe oku kuya kuthatha ixesha.
But it only happened for a long time.	Kodwa kwenzeka kuphela ngexesha elide.
And you are definitely better in class.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ungcono eklasini.
And that will be next week.	Ke oko kuya kuba kwiveki ezayo.
And it will be more difficult.	Kwaye kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
You can go there.	Uyakwazi ukuya apho.
He knew nothing about anything.	Wayengazi nto ngayo nantoni na.
He has his ball.	Unayo ibhola yakhe.
Well, of course, he thought.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, wacinga.
So don't be hard on him.	Ngoko musa ukuba nzima kuye.
But what is one and two things.	Kodwa yintoni enye kwaye izinto ezimbini.
She is afraid to leave the house.	Uyoyika ukuphuma endlwini.
Everyone is successful.	Wonke umntu uphumelele.
He wanted a job badly.	Wayefuna umsebenzi kakubi.
I just thought one thing.	Ndicinge nje into enye.
You probably heard about it.	Mhlawumbi weva ngayo.
Not in my house.	Hayi endlini yam.
This is clear though.	Oku kucacile nangona.
There is an answer to this problem.	Kukho impendulo kule ngxaki.
And now again, right now.	Kwaye ngoku kwakhona, kanye ngoku.
I'm not in your place.	Andikho kwindawo yakho.
A little talk, fine.	Intetho encinci, ilungile.
He did not make her leave.	Akazange enze ukuba ahambe.
It should be hard to find.	Kufuneka kube nzima ukufumana.
As you do now.	Njengokuba wenza ngoku.
But he was not there now.	Kodwa wayengekho ngoku.
There is no time for sleep, though.	Akukho xesha lokulala, nangona kunjalo.
But this is no problem.	Kodwa oku akukho ngxaki.
We did it the other way.	Senze ngenye indlela.
However there is a problem.	Nangona kunjalo kukho ingxaki.
Then, you know.	Emva koko, uyazi.
Soon and he had to be with her again.	Kungekudala kwaye kwafuneka ukuba abe naye kwakhona.
I'll be back for dinner.	Ndiza kubuya kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
Not so now.	Akunjalo nangoku.
He didn't really know.	Wayengazi ngokwenene.
I did one strange thing.	Ndenza into enye engaqhelekanga.
No one else will talk to you.	Akakho omnye umntu oza kuthetha nawe .
And one day it happened.	Kwaye ngenye imini kwenzeka.
Probably never again.	Mhlawumbi soze aphinde ayenze.
The one who came before you.	Lowo weza phambi kwakho.
And you know why.	Kwaye uyasazi isizathu.
Yes, you did well.	Ewe, wenze kakuhle.
But because there is no reason.	Kodwa ngenxa yokuba akukho sizathu.
Decision making.	Ukwenza isigqibo.
Of course, I look good.	Kunjalo, ndijonge kakuhle.
He didn't know he was going there.	Wayengazi ukuba uye apho.
He came this afternoon.	Weza ngale njikalanga.
I tried to read his mind.	Ndazama ukufunda ingqondo yakhe.
I hope you will be with her again soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuba naye kwakhona kungekudala.
He made your marriage for you.	Wenza umtshato wakho ngawe.
He is intelligent in his work.	Ukrelekrele emsebenzini wakhe.
You will be just one thing.	Uya kuba yinto nje enye.
He got very close to her.	Wangena kakhulu kuye.
Well, well, maybe not you.	Ewe, kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi wena.
And that could be a new job for him.	Ke loo nto inokuba ngumsebenzi omtsha kuye.
It's hard but it's okay.	Kunzima kodwa kulungile.
Yes, you can actually make a car.	Ewe, ungayenza ngokwenene imoto.
But one did just that.	Kodwa omnye wenza nje.
He did not know who that was.	Wayengazi ukuba inokuba ngubani na lowo.
You have it, right.	Unayo, ilungile.
It seems to be the case here.	Kubonakala ngathi kunjalo apha.
I'm glad then, of course.	Ndiyavuya ngoko, kunjalo.
The mind.	Ingqondo .
Not just for you.	Hayi nje ngawe.
Eventually he had to leave, though.	Ekugqibeleni kwafuneka ahambe, nangona kunjalo.
But please go now.	Kodwa ndicela uhambe ngoku.
There is great truth in this.	Kukho inyaniso enkulu kule nto.
A little better now, though.	Ukuba ngcono kancinci ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
Or at home.	Okanye ekhaya.
This is the only thing he wants.	Le yinto ayifunayo kuphela.
I want .	Ndifuna .
He will do so all day long.	Uya kuhlala esenza njalo imini yonke.
But for me, it is not.	Kodwa kum, akunjalo.
Soon he will not be.	Kungekudala akasayi kuba njalo.
I know you have to buy somewhere.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka uthenge enye indawo.
He has never told me this before.	Akazange andixelele nantoni na oku ngaphambili.
I did not hear.	Khange ndive.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wathi ewe.
That will be fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi oko.
Good to know this, thank you.	Kuhle ukwazi oku, enkosi.
However, he wants it to be good.	Nangona kunjalo, ufuna ukuba kube kuhle.
I wish it were painful.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube buhlungu.
The question is how to do this.	Umbuzo kukuba ukwenza njani oku.
I do not want to stay in my room all day.	Andifuni ukuhlala imini yonke egumbini lam.
He eventually found a restaurant.	Ekugqibeleni wafumana indawo yokutyela.
It's my doing.	Kukwenza kwam.
He has to come here.	Kufuneka eze apha.
There is no immediate arrival.	Akukho kufika ngokukhawuleza.
I know a little bit about that though though.	Ndiyazi kancinci malunga naloo nto nangona kunjalo.
Not all, mind.	Hayi yonke, ingqondo.
But all is well.	Kodwa konke kulungile.
He slept well.	Walala kakuhle.
Finally he sat down.	Ekugqibeleni wahlala phantsi.
I also did not want to think.	Nam ndandingafuni ukucinga.
It wasn’t, and we didn’t.	Kwakungekho, kwaye asizange senze.
It just takes more time.	Kuthatha nje ixesha elingakumbi.
He speaks loudly.	Uthetha ngamandla.
He had to tell me.	Kwafuneka andixelele.
It is better to talk as little as possible.	Kungcono ukuthetha kancinci kangangoko.
Just, really alone.	Nje, ngenene wedwa.
It happened all night.	Kwenzeka ubusuku bonke.
That can really happen.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
At night you come here.	Ebusuku uza apha.
Good, just fine.	Kuhle, kuhle nje.
It lasts a long time.	Uhlala ixesha elide.
John did well.	UJohn wenza kakuhle.
He said he should be alone.	Wathi kufuneka abe yedwa.
We want a story.	Sifuna ibali.
No one can have it all.	Akukho mntu unokuba nayo yonke into.
Just look, whenever you have time.	Jonga nje, nanini na unexesha.
I don’t think it will be that easy.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
This is a very small thing.	Le yinto encinci kakhulu.
I want to do it after that.	Ndifuna ukuyenza emva koko.
Or you should not come.	Okanye akufuneki uze.
I will go again.	Ndiza kuhamba kwakhona.
It seems, if done properly.	Kubonakala ngathi, ukuba yenziwe kakuhle.
I'm here today.	Ndilapha namhlanje.
I mean, really, really bad.	Ndithetha, ngenene, embi kakhulu.
Well, you know what happens next.	Ewe, uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
No one has shared.	Akukho mntu uye waba.
Well, not just.	Ewe, hayi nje.
He knows it has to happen.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka yenzeke.
I'm going somewhere.	Ndiya kwindawo.
And that has been very good for us.	Kwaye oko kube kuhle kakhulu kuthi.
At this point, you might be right.	Ngeli xesha, unokuba ulungile.
It happens very often everywhere.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu kuyo yonke indawo.
It happened that way.	Kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
But that is simply not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
He is confident that they will.	Uqinisekile ukuba baya kwenza njalo.
There was no one inside at the time.	Kwakungekho mntu ngaphakathi ngelo xesha.
This did not happen to him.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke kuye.
I wish only one thing.	Ndinqwenela into enye kuphela.
No, you really do not want to.	Hayi, ngenene awufuni.
I want a plan, he thought.	Ndifuna icebo, wacinga.
There was no one going anywhere.	Kwakungekho mntu uya ndawo.
You can play indoors or outdoors.	Uyakwazi ukudlala ngaphakathi okanye ngaphandle.
The woman did not agree.	Umfazi akazange avume.
What do you plan to do with it ?.	Uceba ukwenza ntoni ngayo?.
Now you .	Ngoku wena .
Obviously something else is happening here.	Ngokucacileyo kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
Now, this has not hurt, at all.	Ngoku, oku akuzange kube buhlungu, konke konke.
And that.	Kwaye ukuba .
They all live.	Bahlala bonke.
It will get there again.	Iza kufika apho kwakhona.
No one thought about him.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ngaye.
But you definitely have it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo unayo.
He certainly knew better than I did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayesazi ngcono kunam.
He has a girlfriend.	Unayo intombi.
And you look good, too.	Kwaye ukhangeleka ulungile, nawe.
But if you only knew.	Kodwa ukuba ubusazi.
This will require your help.	Oku kuya kufuna uncedo lwakho.
I want everything to happen now.	Ndifuna yonke into yenzeke ngoku.
And that's the way it is.	Kwaye yiloo ndlela ukuze.
Great big thing.	Into enkulu enkulu.
But he did nothing about it.	Kodwa akazange enze nto ngaloo nto.
You will always be that way.	Uya kuhlala unjalo.
I think there is no question.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho mbuzo.
I live very much alone.	Ndihlala ndedwa kakhulu.
I would like to say something right away.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha into ngoko nangoko.
One problem at a time.	Ingxaki enye ngexesha.
He seldom goes to town.	Akafane aye edolophini.
I did that.	Ndenze loo nto.
He is all asleep.	Ulele wonke.
I can not see.	Andikwazi kubonakala.
It's hard for you.	Kunzima kuwe.
But not much more.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu ngakumbi.
No one tried to say a word.	Akukho mntu wazama ukuthetha kancinci.
He told me all this later.	Wandixelela yonke lento emva kwexesha.
Don't talk about it.	Musa ukuthetha ngayo.
But this one will succeed.	Kodwa lo uza kuphumelela.
You, me and him.	Wena, mna naye.
I mean every day.	Ndithetha yonke imihla.
And he has to come first.	Kwaye kufuneka eze kuqala.
No one knew what he was thinking at the time.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba acinge ntoni ngelo xesha.
Except for breakfast.	Ngaphandle kwesidlo sakusasa.
He would come here.	Wayeza kufika apha.
That's why he wanted to go.	Yiyo loo nto wayefuna ukuhamba.
And that seems good to me.	Kwaye oko kubonakala kulungile kum.
It seemed to me.	Kwakubonakala kum.
He tried to quit, but he could not.	Wazama ukuyeka, kodwa akazange akwazi.
But what happens when you.	Kodwa kwenzeka ntoni xa wena.
He did not think so.	Akazange acinge njalo.
Tomorrow, yes, but not today.	Ngomso, ewe, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
Yes, it would.	Ewe, bekuya kuba njalo.
There are so many things here.	Kukho izinto ezininzi apha.
There was no reason for him to be alone.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba abe yedwa.
I just want something bigger.	Ndifuna nje into enkulu.
And he also knows it.	Kwaye naye uyayazi.
You probably won't have to.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kufuneka ukuba kunjalo.
But there is someone else there.	Kodwa kukho omnye umntu apho.
That will go well.	Oko kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
This problem can be serious.	Le ngxaki inokuba nzima.
But my father would not agree.	Kodwa utata akazange avume.
You have no idea how much this means to me.	Awuyazi ukuba oku kuthetha kangakanani kum.
He would need more when he arrived.	Wayeza kufuna ezinye xa efika.
But nobody thinks about that.	Kodwa akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto.
Yes, not long ago.	Ewe, hayi kudala.
Only you and me, really.	Mna nawe kuphela, ngenene.
He says he needs your help.	Uthi ufuna uncedo lwakho.
Books everywhere.	Iincwadi kuyo yonke indawo.
It seems like a thing.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto.
It has to happen here.	Kumele kwenzeke apha.
By the way .	Kunjalo nje .
If it is.	Ukuba nguye.
At that he said.	Ngelo xesha wathi .
Her bedroom in her house.	Igumbi lakhe lokulala endlwini yakhe.
I have to go anyway.	Kufuneka ndihambe kunjalo.
We must not have any other way.	Akufunekanga sibe nayo nayiphi na enye indlela.
Or maybe you just felt that way.	Okanye mhlawumbi waziva ngolo hlobo.
Look ahead.	Jonga ngaphambili.
He is just like that.	Unjalo nje .
You just want to do it.	Ufuna nje ukuyenza.
He can do it.	Uyakwazi ukwenza.
Some mind please.	Ingqondo ethile nceda.
I did not live alone.	Andizange ndihlale ndedwa.
The truth is, that is not the case.	Inyaniso kukuba, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
Only he did not know how.	Kuphela wayengazi ukuba njani.
So he is afraid now.	Ngoko uyoyika ngoku.
He did so.	Wenza njalo .
One doctor says one thing, another doctor one thing.	Omnye ugqirha uthetha enye into, omnye ugqirha into enye.
Maybe it's time.	Mhlawumbi lixesha.
They say it's true.	Bathi yinyani.
And what is all this? 	Kwaye ingaba yintoni yonke le nto?
I wonder if this is it.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngaba oku.
You will get your chance with him.	Uya kufumana ithuba lakho kunye naye.
Then she said that her father wanted to talk to her.	Emva koko wathi utata wakhe ufuna ukuthetha naye.
I can't say such a thing.	Andikwazi ukuthetha into enjalo.
It takes time to talk a little.	Kuthatha ixesha ukuthetha kancinci.
And then other things.	Kwaye ke ezinye izinto.
Traveling takes a long time.	Ukuhamba kuthatha ixesha elide.
He must have wanted to talk to her.	Umele ukuba wayefuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye.
He does it regularly and well.	Uyenza loo nto rhoqo kwaye kakuhle.
Well with it all.	Kakuhle ngayo yonke.
It's just a job.	Ngumsebenzi nje .
There is no need to do too much.	Akukho mfuneko yokwenza ezininzi.
I never thought it would be that easy.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
You go to it.	Uya kuyo.
Just a little better.	Ngcono nje kancinci.
I'll have to wait another week.	Kuza kufuneka ndilinde enye iveki.
We'll talk out.	Siza kuthetha phandle.
Although it may be nice to stay the night.	Nangona kunokuba kuhle ukuhlala ubusuku.
I tried this method.	Ndazama le ndlela.
Well, too late.	Ewe, emva kwexesha kakhulu.
It is good to help other people.	Kulungile ukunceda abanye abantu.
My mother did not.	Umama akazange.
This, of course, never happened.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akuzange kube njalo.
I'm not sure what it was at first.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni na ekuqaleni.
Because of him.	Ngenxa yakhe .
And the best answer.	Kwaye impendulo engcono.
It would be great if he could do it today.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba angayenza namhlanje.
He thought he was doing the same thing.	Wayecinga ukuba wenza into efanayo.
So this means.	Ngoko oku kuthetha.
However it can be very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo inokuba nzima kakhulu.
I couldn't help myself.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba nam.
I will go .	Ndiza kuhamba .
I do that now.	Ndenza njalo ngoku.
You should not do this.	Akufanele wenze ngolu hlobo.
It will be easier to die.	Kuya kuba lula ukufa.
In that case, you have to make a decision.	Xa kunjalo, kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
If you can't do it, don't do it.	Ukuba awukwazi ukuyenza, musa ukuyenza.
Or this morning.	Okanye ngale ntsasa.
Then he said yes.	Emva koko wathi ewe.
I could not do this.	Andikwazanga ukwenza oku.
I mean you're really ready.	Ndithetha ukuba ukulungele ngokwenene.
You will want to see this.	Uya kufuna ukubona oku.
This can just be a thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto nje.
Before you do that.	Ngaphambi kokuba wenze loo nto.
Everything myself.	Yonke into ngokwam.
He has made his peace.	Wenze uxolo lwakhe.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo kwaphela.
They will all go shopping.	Bonke baya kuthenga.
Mother was afraid that she would never have a daughter.	UMama wayesoyika ukuba soze abe nayo intombi.
I'll get to that soon.	Ndiza kufika kuloo nto kungekudala.
I think we made a mistake there.	Ndicinga ukuba senze impazamo apho.
And if there is.	Kwaye ukuba kukho.
Everything is fine here.	Yonke into ilungile apha.
That is certainly hope.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo lithemba.
You have not been well.	Awuzange ube kakuhle.
You know, it's the same thing.	Uyazi, yinto enye.
No one is wasting everything.	Akukho mntu uchitha yonke into.
I think what it is.	Ndicinga ukuba yintoni na.
So he tried.	Ngoko wazama.
He knew he would never tell the truth.	Wayesazi ukuba soze athethe inyani.
I hope to see everyone there.	Ndiyathemba ukubona wonke umntu apho.
He is.	Unjalo .
That means it will go better.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kuya kuhamba ngcono.
Not next week.	Hayi kwiveki ezayo.
He is not alone.	Akakho yedwa.
To me, that’s not far enough.	Kum, oko akukho phantse kude ngokwaneleyo.
You might just be.	Usenokuba nje .
Unless you probably said yes.	Ngaphandle kokuba mhlawumbi uthe ewe.
I have to think, not talk.	Kufuneka ndicinge, hayi ukuthetha.
I did not know for sure.	Ndandingazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Or another job.	Okanye omnye umsebenzi.
But death will be easier for you.	Kodwa ukufa kuya kuba lula kuwe.
His really.	Yakhe ngokwenene.
Because of him, he said.	Ngenxa yakhe, wathi.
We'll see about it.	Siza kubona ngayo.
I've told you this before.	Ndikuxelele oku ngaphambili.
There are people.	Kukho abantu.
Maybe someone else did.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu wenza.
You can't sing lying on the floor.	Awukwazi ukucula ulele phantsi.
All the way, whatever it is.	Yonke indlela, nokuba yintoni na.
I had to do it all.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze yonke.
We know we will continue.	Siyazi ukuba siza kuqhubeka.
It would be like doing so.	Bekuya kuba ngathi ukwenjenjalo.
And to do this.	Kwaye ukuze wenze oku.
He has to do it.	Kufuneka enze njalo.
Almost everyone is here.	Phantse wonke umntu ulapha.
This is just a fact.	Le yinyani nje.
That seems too old.	Oko kubonakala kudala kakhulu.
But look no further.	Kodwa jonga ngakumbi.
And there is no time today.	Kwaye akukho xesha namhlanje.
Everything was easy, in the end.	Konke kube lula, ekugqibeleni.
Another.	Enye .
I would really like to buy one.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuthenga enye.
All his talk about big money.	Yonke intetho yakhe ngemali enkulu.
I will always think well of you.	Ndiya kuhlala ndicinga kakuhle ngawe.
Not his father or his mother.	Hayi utata wakhe okanye umama wakhe.
But that's the problem now.	Kodwa nantso ke ingxaki ngoku.
He must have known by now.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ngoku.
I'm talking about you.	Ndithetha ngawe.
You know, just all over there.	Uyazi, konke nje phaya.
Something happened there, you know, he said something.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apho, uyazi, wathetha into ethile.
And now there you are, of course.	Kwaye ngoku kukho wena, kunjalo.
Not because you have to, but because you want to.	Hayi ngenxa yokuba kufuneka, kodwa ngenxa yokuba ufuna.
And then you can do it for me.	Kwaye ke ungayenza kum.
But this place is coming to you.	Kodwa le ndawo iza kuwe.
He has gone with her.	Uye wahamba naye.
Otherwise, it will be difficult to find your way.	Ngaphandle koko, kuya kuba nzima ukufumana indlela yakho.
And without exception.	Kwaye ngaphandle ngokupheleleyo.
To us, to him.	Kuthi, kuye.
But that will only make you better.	Kodwa oko kuya kukwenza ube ngcono.
I had to stay in the hospital.	Bekufanele ndihlale esibhedlele.
However, we will not do this.	Nangona kunjalo, asiyi kuyenza le nto.
However, we know that should not happen.	Nangona kunjalo, siyazi ukuba akufanele kwenzeke.
No one felt like coming.	Akukho mntu waziva efuna ukuza.
I wanted him to do something about her.	Bendifuna enze into ngaye.
And it doesn't have to be this way.	Kwaye akufuneki kube njalo.
Stop playing lightly.	Yeka ukudlala kancinci.
Again, he thought it was weird.	Kwakhona, wacinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
You do not have to think.	Akufunekanga ucinge.
He can sing.	Uyakwazi ukucula.
He will not say why.	Akayi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
No one is good at everything.	Akukho mntu ulungile kuyo yonke into.
It never happened, of course.	Akuzange kwenzeke, kunjalo.
Your mother said she did.	Umama wakho uthe wenza.
So, what did he do.	Ke, wenza ntoni.
They will go.	Baza kuhamba.
He really needs help.	Ufuna uncedo ngenene.
There was no one to talk to at all.	Kwakungekho mntu uthetha naye konke konke.
There is no way for you.	Akukho ndlela kuwe.
But this is not me.	Kodwa ayindim lo.
Everyone will get a voice.	Wonke umntu uya kufumana ilizwi.
There is a long finish.	Kukho ukugqiba ixesha elide.
I had to look away.	Kwafuneka ndijonge ecaleni.
Do you think so? 	Ngaba ucinga njalo?
Now, this will continue for a very long time.	Ngoku, oku kuya kuqhubeka ixesha elide kakhulu.
You know this place.	Uyayazi le ndawo.
All but him.	Bonke ngaphandle kwakhe.
Such an old place.	Indawo endala kangaka.
Maybe you really think.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ngokwenene.
The man did not speak.	Umntu akazange athethe.
No matter how long it takes.	Nokuba oko kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
Who is this .	Ngubani lo .
All of this did not happen.	Yonke le nto ayizange yenzeke.
I knew it could be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba inokuba njalo.
Maybe it's okay to be so.	Mhlawumbi kulungile ukuba kube njalo.
It certainly seems like one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi enye.
But it did not hurt.	Kodwa akuzange kube buhlungu.
That is old enough.	Kudala ngokwaneleyo oko.
Eventually he decided to act fast.	Ekugqibeleni wagqiba ekubeni enze ngokukhawuleza.
I think we will be together for a long time.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kuba kunye ixesha elide.
Now you know better.	Ngoku uyazi ngcono.
He took a picture.	Wathatha umfanekiso.
He lives in my place.	Uhlala kwindawo yam.
Or I just wanted to.	Okanye ndandifuna.
And there was nothing in that place.	Kwaye kwakungekho nto kuloo ndawo.
I thought he was determined.	Ndandicinga ukuba uzimisele.
That we will not do.	Oko asiyi kuyenza.
He did not read.	Akazange afunde.
But to simplify everything.	Kodwa ukwenza lula yonke into.
You didn't talk much, so you didn't know much about him.	Zange uthethe kakhulu, ngoko awuzange wazi kakhulu ngaye.
My answer is, I do not know.	Impendulo yam kukuba, andazi.
You think, yes.	Ucinga ukuba, ewe.
But now we have to go.	Kodwa ngoku kufuneka sihambe.
He tried to think of something he wanted to say.	Wazama ukucinga ngento afuna ukuyithetha.
So and so.	Ngoko kwaye njalo.
It is much better to have this.	Kungcono kakhulu ukuba lo.
We will find a better place.	Siza kufumana indawo engcono.
Unless we do.	Ngaphandle kokuba senze.
More on that now.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto ngoku.
I do it all the time.	Ndenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
He arrived immediately.	Wafika ngoko nangoko.
Only at the beginning.	Kuphela ekuqaleni.
He had to stop walking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukuhamba.
He has to study on his own.	Kufuneka afunde yedwa.
Maybe, or not.	Mhlawumbi, okanye hayi.
I can walk and be myself.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba kwaye ndibe ndim.
Let me talk to him first.	Makhe ndithethe naye kuqala.
We had to do some work first.	Kwafuneka senze umsebenzi kuqala.
At that moment he died himself.	Ngelo xesha wafa ngokwakhe.
We will be with you soon.	Siza kuba nawe kungekudala.
So, there are a lot of questions.	Ngoko ke, kukho imibuzo emininzi.
I will have to do this alone.	Kuza kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa le nto.
You did not succeed.	Awuzange uphumelele.
John told her everything.	UYohane wamxelela yonke into.
Now food.	Ngoku ukutya.
And he did nothing back.	Kwaye akazange enze nto emva .
Now, almost everyone does.	Ngoku, phantse wonke umntu wenza njalo.
Although you.	Nangona wena .
He told me dad.	Undixelele utata.
And true.	Kwaye inyaniso.
Just because.	Kanye nje ngokuba.
I heard nothing, nothing, nothing.	Khange ndive kwanto, kwanto, hayi kwanto.
Yes, you do have permission at this time.	Ewe, unayo imvume ngeli xesha.
You know, something new.	Uyazi, into entsha.
He went right into it.	Uye wangena kanye kuyo.
I was thinking badly.	Ndandicinga kakubi.
Or piano.	Okanye ipiyano.
But all that now.	Kodwa yonke loo nto ngoku.
But it is very difficult to do this with it.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukwenza oku ngayo.
You wish I knew you were right.	Ungathanda ukuba ndiyazi ukuba ulungile.
So it always is.	Ngoko kuhlala kunjalo.
No, not now.	Akunjalo, hayi ngoku.
Did he want to do it again.	Ngaba wayefuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
Nobody wants to be there right now.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba lapho ngoku.
It was not long before he fell asleep.	Khange kube kudala walala.
So you have to be there.	Ngoko kufuneka ube lapho.
And there are eyes.	Kwaye kukho amehlo.
The problem is that you can't say that.	Ingxaki kukuba awukwazi ukuthetha loo nto.
But better, of course.	Kodwa ngcono, kunjalo.
And he is very good at it.	Kwaye ulungile kakhulu kuyo.
We'll see, really.	Siza kubona, ngokwenene.
He makes it hard for him to stay.	Wenza ukuba kube nzima ukuba ahlale.
You have to do a very good job.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
Your mind is well made.	Ingqondo yakho yenziwe kakuhle.
I could not really give up.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka ngokwenene.
He also did not want to leave.	Naye wayengafuni ukuhamba.
He would talk to her immediately.	Wayeza kuthetha naye ngokukhawuleza.
Finally, the woman also died.	Ekugqibeleni, naye umfazi wafa.
He decided to buy a car.	Wagqiba ukuthenga imoto.
He did not know where he wanted to be.	Akazange apho wayefuna ukuba khona.
This, no, is not.	Oku, hayi, akunjalo.
He did not, however.	Akazange nangona kunjalo.
I'm not sure what you really expect.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ulindele ntoni ngokwenene.
Maybe you should have done a lot of things.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba wenze izinto ezininzi.
I only went once.	Ndaya kanye kuphela.
He has agreed to go.	Uye wavuma ukuhamba.
And anyone.	Kwaye nabani na.
Then that happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka oko.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
Then maybe he won't.	Emva koko mhlawumbi akayi.
He pulled out a gun.	Waphuma umpu.
Everyone will find something there.	Wonke umntu uya kufumana into apho.
There is something strange about this place.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga ngale ndawo.
He found just one more thing.	Wafumana into eninzi nje enye.
Not in the same way.	Hayi ngendlela efanayo.
I don't know how exactly.	Andazi ukuba njani kanye.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni athethe.
We won't have it there, of course.	Asiyi kuba nayo apho, kunjalo.
He seemed to know a lot.	Kwakubonakala ngathi wayesazi kakhulu.
That's what you intend to be.	Yiloo nto uzimisele ukuba yiyo.
Sure, you know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyazi.
A week or two is a lot of time.	Iveki okanye ezimbini lixesha elininzi.
That means there are others behind you.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kukho abanye emva kwakho.
You will get better there.	Uya kuba ngcono apho.
I think one learns something new every day.	Ndicinga ukuba umntu ufunda into entsha yonke imihla.
So yes, that's right.	Ngoko ewe, kunjalo.
You know it will be difficult.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
And he always talks.	Kwaye uhlala ethetha.
This requires space.	Oku kufuna indawo.
My mother never did that.	Umama akazange ayenze loo nto.
I never thought that way about it.	Andizange ndikhe ndicinge ngolo hlobo ngaloo nto.
Now enough about that.	Ngoku ngokwaneleyo malunga naloo nto.
I always stay longer.	Ndihlala ndihlala ixesha elide.
I didn't, I didn't.	Andizange, andizange.
I know, I know.	Ndiyazi, ndiyazi.
And if that happens.	Kwaye ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
But this is not going to go away.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuhamba njani.
Thanks again everyone !.	Enkosi kwakhona wonke umntu!.
We certainly know that now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siyazi ukuba ngoku.
I want to take things down.	Ndifuna ukuthatha izinto phantsi.
Everyone can make a mistake.	Wonke umntu ungayenza impazamo.
Everyone wants to stop.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba ayeke.
That's all right.	Yonke loo nto ilungile.
I do just a little bit to help.	Ndenza nje kancinci ukunceda.
I do my homework.	Ndenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo.
I have thought about this for a long time and it is difficult.	Ndiye ndacinga ngale nto ixesha elide kwaye kunzima.
That is good for him.	Oko kulungile kuye.
I want everyone to know that they are going to get better.	Ndifuna wonke umntu azi ukuba baya kuba ngcono.
Now there is only one.	Ngoku kukho enye kuphela.
He did not look for an opportunity.	Akazange afune ithuba.
That's fine, and I like it.	Ilungile loo nto, kwaye ndiyayithanda.
No one really knew what to do with it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kakuhle ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
He must tell the police.	Kufuneka axelele amapolisa.
He wanted to do what was right.	Wayefuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
I'm always scared.	Ndiyoyika rhoqo.
But he stayed there.	Kodwa wahlala apho.
But sooner or later everyone did.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva wonke umntu wenza.
He will do that immediately.	Uza kuyenza loo nto ngoko nangoko.
Or we will try.	Okanye ke siza kuzama.
But a doctor.	Kodwa ugqirha.
I need to talk to you today.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe namhlanje.
That is my hope here.	Lithemba lam elo apha.
Not a bad thing at all.	Hayi into embi ncam.
All except for nothing.	Konke ngaphandle kwanto.
He just sat there.	Wahlala nje apho.
He will have to tell.	Kuya kufuneka axelele.
If all goes well.	Ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle.
Then talk to me.	Uze uthethe nam.
You have it in the back.	Unayo ngasemva.
So it certainly wasn't good.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungekho kuhle.
To do such a thing.	Ukwenza into enjalo.
To be a better person.	Ukuba ngumntu ongcono.
John must have been here before he left.	UYohane umele ukuba wayesele elapha waza wemka.
But now, he didn't know what to do.	Kodwa ngoku, wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni na.
I talk a lot about that.	Ndithetha kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I have to think the same thing.	Nam kufuneka ndicinge njalo.
Things to him.	Izinto kuye.
It will definitely come back.	Iza kubuya ngokuqinisekileyo.
I am.	Mna ke.
I'm not very outgoing.	Andikho ngaphandle kakhulu.
No one ever talked like that to him.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngolu hlobo naye.
I'm not sure where or how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza phi okanye njani le nto.
Please wait here.	Nceda ulinde apha.
I will not be there every day, but more than that.	Andiyi kuba khona yonke imihla, kodwa ngaphezu koko.
Or your age.	Okanye iminyaka yakho.
Or he did not.	Okanye akazange enze.
If this takes.	Ukuba oku kuthatha.
I don't remember anything after that.	Andikhumbuli nto emva koko.
We want this to be painful.	Sifuna oku kube buhlungu.
Finally, he asked questions.	Ekugqibeleni, wabuza imibuzo.
I want to do better myself.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono mna.
It is very difficult for me to do anything.	Kunzima kakhulu kum ukwenza nantoni na.
He wanted to say something and nothing.	Wayefuna ukuthetha into kwaye akukho nto.
You may want to read about it here.	Mhlawumbi ungathanda ukufunda ngalo apha.
Really, you do not want to.	Ngokwenene, awufuni.
I thought it would be hard.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
So this can be the case, for me.	Ngoko oku kunokuba njalo, kum.
But he knew for sure that this was not the case.	Kodwa wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba khange kube njalo.
And not tomorrow.	Kwaye hayi ngomso.
I want to be me and no one else.	Ndifuna ukuba ndim hayi omnye umntu.
His case.	Ityala lakhe .
It gets easier as you go.	Kuba lula njengoko uhamba.
You will not be.	Awuyi kuba .
So let's do this.	Ngoko ke makhe le nto.
I love a good book.	Ndiyayithanda incwadi elungileyo.
You know, and he did.	Uyazi, kwaye wenza njalo.
So how about that.	Ngoko njani ngaloo nto.
He is afraid of almost everything.	Uyoyika phantse yonke into.
But I am the one who says this.	Kodwa ndim lo uthetha lento.
This does the job.	Oku kwenza umsebenzi.
Or buy a new car.	Okanye uthenge imoto entsha.
He said everything seems fine.	Uthe konke kubonakala kulungile.
He said he wanted me to keep talking about it.	Wathi ufuna ndihlale ndithetha ngayo.
And that's not the problem.	Kwaye ayisiyiyo ingxaki.
There is a chance that.	Kukho ithuba lokuba.
My father knew.	Utata wayesazi.
Don't be.	Musa ukuba.
This, of course, is not what happens.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, ayisiyiyo into eyenzekayo.
And you probably will not succeed.	Kwaye mhlawumbi awuyi kuphumelela.
This does it fast.	Oku kuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
I can't get out of there.	Andikwazi ukuphuma phaya.
It's all work.	Ngumsebenzi wonke.
No, not now, not later.	Hayi, hayi ngoku, kamva.
I did not speak to him directly.	Khange ndithethe naye ncam.
See who you want to be.	Jonga ukuba ufuna ukuba ngubani.
Not nearly the same thing.	Akukho phantse into efanayo.
I just made a look.	Ndenze nje ukuba ndijonge.
I just can't, like, take a call with you.	Andikwazi nje, njengokuba, ukuthatha umnxeba nawe.
I don't want it to happen.	Andifuni kwenzeke.
You are really successful.	Uphumelele ngokwenene.
But one has to make a decision.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
It seems to me very much.	Kubonakala kum kakhulu.
He has done so all my life.	Wenze njalo ubomi bam bonke.
He certainly made many friends.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wenza abahlobo abaninzi.
I will buy one.	Ndiza kuthenga enye.
But you want to make a lot of money quickly.	Kodwa ufuna ukwenza imali eninzi ngokukhawuleza.
Not too long.	Hayi ixesha elide kakhulu.
This he very much knew.	Oku kakhulu wayesazi.
If it's true, fine.	Ukuba yinyani, kulungile.
However, doctor.	Nangona kunjalo, ugqirha.
And really, that's exactly right.	Kwaye ngokwenene, oko kunjalo kanye.
Such he thought.	Enjalo wacinga.
Yes, certainly next week.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kwiveki ezayo.
He did a lot of time.	Wenza ixesha elininzi.
I know that, of course.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, kunjalo.
You said nothing.	Awuzange uthethe nto.
To you alone.	Kuwe wedwa.
He was not here.	Wayengekho apha.
My wife is happy.	Umfazi wam uyavuya.
Obviously you have to stay optimistic.	Ngokucacileyo kufuneka uhlale unethemba.
Where are you?!.	Uphi?!.
He ate something all the time.	Watya into ngalo lonke ixesha.
That's a girl.	Nantso intombi.
It must have been a long time ago.	Kumele ukuba kudala.
But you already know that.	Kodwa sele uyayazi loo nto.
Tomorrow, maybe, we'll have him.	Ngomso, mhlawumbi, siza kuba naye.
Sorry, please.	Uxolo, nceda.
He thought she was too old for him.	Wayecinga ukuba mdala kakhulu kuye.
He agreed to be alone.	Wavuma ukuba yedwa.
She felt a strong desire to be with him.	Waziva efuna ngamandla ukuba kunye naye.
No, he will not cause any problems.	Hayi, akayi kwenza nayiphi na ingxaki.
She looked inside him.	Ujonge ngaphakathi kuye.
Probably more than any of us.	Mhlawumbi ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na kuthi.
And he did not tell anyone why he was leaving.	Kwaye akazange axelele nabani na isizathu sokuba ahambe.
Whatever it may be.	Nokuba inokuba yintoni na.
And then he had to stay inside.	Kwaye ke kwafuneka ahlale ngaphakathi.
But there is one very strange fact.	Kodwa kukho inyani enye engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
It was not too difficult to do.	Kwakungekho nzima kakhulu ukuyenza.
He returned to his seat and sat down again.	Wabuyela kwindawo yakhe, wahlala phantsi kwakhona.
How wrong it is.	Hayi indlela engalunganga ngayo.
There is something wrong with this.	Kukho into engalunganga ngale nto.
He ran to us.	Wabaleka weza kuthi.
And he's just a good man.	Kwaye yindoda nje elungileyo.
I do it all.	Ndiyenza yonke.
I do not believe it to be true.	Andikholelwa ukuba yinyani.
This one! 	Le!
And so far, it has never been.	Kwaye kude kube ngoku, akuzange kube njalo.
That's his big thing.	Nantso into yakhe enkulu.
Whenever you want.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ufuna.
He does not know here.	Akazi apha.
Maybe not all the time but every other time.	Mhlawumbi hayi lonke ixesha kodwa lonke elinye ixesha.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba uyayazi lonto.
There is, but not really, not exactly.	Kukho, kodwa hayi ngokwenene, hayi ncam.
I had no idea how I felt about it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndiziva njani ngaloo nto.
If so, how?	Ukuba kunjalo, njani?
That is not necessary at all.	Akuyomfuneko kwaphela oko.
How are you feeling?.	Uziva njani?.
He looked at what they were going to do with it.	Wajonga ukuba baya kwenza ntoni na ngalo.
It does not last long.	Akukho kuhlala ixesha elide.
No, not at all.	Akunjalo, ngakumbi.
He knew but did not say anything.	Wayesazi kodwa akazange athethe nto.
Not you or me, but people.	Hayi wena okanye mna, kodwa abantu.
Our biggest problem.	Ingxaki yethu enkulu.
This is probably the same thing.	Oku mhlawumbi yinto enye.
You do not have to be alone.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube wedwa.
However, it did not happen.	Nangona kunjalo, ayizange yenzeke.
He learned that way.	Wafunda ngaloo ndlela.
It takes a long time to travel.	Kuthatha ixesha elide ukuhamba.
And now these.	Kwaye ngoku ezi.
One never knows what will happen.	Umntu akazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Let's just say.	Makhe nje .
We will come again.	Siza kuza kwakhona.
My answer is me.	Impendulo yam ndim.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa ke akazange athethe nto.
I want to do well.	Ndifuna ukwenza kakuhle.
Your children are everywhere.	Abantwana bakho yonke indawo.
Nowhere really.	Akukho ndawo ngokwenene.
You will be together.	Uya kuba kunye.
Then he looked at his little daughter.	Emva koko wajonga intombi yakhe encinci.
Nobody ever come this way, nobody ever come this way.	Akukho mntu wakha weza ngolu hlobo, akukho mntu wakha weza ngolu hlobo.
We'll get another one.	Siza kufumana enye.
You’re going to be fine, and you really want to go.	Uza kuhamba kakuhle, kwaye ngokwenene ufuna ukuhamba.
My mother never had it.	Umama akazange abe nayo.
You must come alone.	Kufuneka uze wedwa.
No, he would take his time.	Hayi, wayeza kuthatha ixesha lakhe.
Everyone loves her.	Wonke umntu uyamthanda .
There is no anger in you.	Akukho nokuba nomsindo kuwe.
I think you will succeed.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kuphumelela.
Yes, they will.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo baya kwenza njalo.
It means a lot.	Kuthetha into enkulu.
He also gave me that.	Naye wandinika lonto.
This will happen today.	Oku kuya kwenzeka namhlanje.
Yes, he is.	Ewe uqinisekile.
Anyone knows what's going on.	Nabani na uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Nothing is made of it.	Akukho nto yenziwe ngayo.
I look at him a lot.	Ndijonge kuye kakhulu.
I will come back to learn more.	Ndiza kubuya ukufunda ngakumbi.
Everything seems to be going well.	Kubonakala ngathi yonke into ilungile.
You never went to you.	Awuzange uye kuwe.
He wants what he wants.	Ufuna le nto ayifunayo.
We will talk about everything.	Siza kuthetha ngayo yonke into.
The food is very good though.	Ukutya kuhle kakhulu nangona kunjalo.
Not every day.	Hayi yonke imihla yonke imihla.
You will be very happy to do it.	Uya kuba mnandi kakhulu ukuyenza.
Probably not at this time.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngeli xesha.
The answer is man.	Impendulo ngumntu.
And something happened at my school.	Kwaye kukho into eyenzekayo esikolweni sam.
It is possible, of course.	Kunokwenzeka, kunjalo.
But tonight there is something else.	Kodwa ngokuhlwanje kukho enye into.
Two days too late.	Iintsuku ezimbini emva kwexesha kakhulu.
It seems unlikely that this would happen.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukuba oku kunokuba njalo.
And in that moment he understood.	Kwaye ngelo xesha waqonda.
I knew it all the time.	Bendisazi lonke ixesha.
Maybe he can't, either.	Mhlawumbi akakwazi, naye.
If so, there is an error.	Ukuba kunjalo, kukho impazamo.
I have to think about something.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngento.
But you too one day.	Kodwa nawe ngenye imini.
Here or outside.	Apha okanye ngaphandle.
And it is not easy to imagine.	Kwaye akukho lula ukucinga.
Coming to class will be your best friend.	Ukuza eklasini kuya kuba ngumhlobo wakho omkhulu.
Or almost completely.	Okanye phantse ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe next week, maybe next month.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo, mhlawumbi kwinyanga ezayo.
And he knew why, too.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba kutheni, naye.
To do, to do, to do.	Ukwenza, ukwenza, ukwenza.
I hope they stay away from that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba bahlala kude kuloo nto.
I don't have to tell you that.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndikuxelele loo nto.
He tries to pretend that nothing happened.	Uzama ukwenza ngathi akukho nto yenzekileyo.
You are afraid that you are doing a good job.	Uyoyika ukuba wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
I talk about it all the time.	Ndithetha ngayo rhoqo.
I mean, to you.	Ndithetha, kuwe.
See how far away it is.	Jonga ukuba kude kangakanani.
If you did.	Ukuba uyenzile.
My mother lives with us.	Umama uhlala nathi.
He had to speak alone.	Kwafuneka athethe yedwa.
And he said he would.	Kwaye wathi uya kwenza.
It will be good to read here.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukufunda apha.
Some people, no.	Abanye abantu, akukho.
It seemed that everyone wanted to go home.	Kwakubonakala ngathi wonke umntu wayefuna ukuba agoduke.
He suggested many things to her.	Wacebisa izinto ezininzi kuye.
He thought it was right.	Wayecinga ukuba ilungile.
Maybe ahead of time, but you can’t.	Mhlawumbi ngaphambi kwexesha, kodwa awukwazi.
Thank you so much for this !.	Enkosi kakhulu ngale nto!.
But either way, it will happen.	Kodwa nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, kuya kwenzeka.
Finally, he spoke first.	Ekugqibeleni, wathetha kuqala.
The decision will be his.	Ukwenza isigqibo kuya kuba nguye.
He never spoke to her again.	Akazange aphinde athethe naye.
We will do our best to help you.	Siya kwenza konke okusemandleni ukukunceda.
I was looking for my place.	Bendifuna indawo yam.
I'm not for you.	Andikho kuwe.
My mother made a decision.	Umama wenza isigqibo.
Marriage works the same way.	Umtshato usebenza ngendlela efanayo.
And then again, maybe you wish.	Kwaye ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi unqwenela.
We'll get there, finally.	Siza kufika apho, ekugqibeleni.
Now he spends time at home.	Ngoku uchitha ixesha ekhaya.
I'll get a call.	Ndiza kufumana umnxeba.
And that's all.	Kwaye oko kuphela.
Good coffee, too.	Ikofu entle, nayo.
I never thought of a reason.	Andizange ndicinge isizathu.
I got to bed.	Ndifike ebhedini.
I told her the whole story.	Ndamxelela lonke ibali.
Nobody wants to go out.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuphuma.
He looked at the phone.	Wajonga umnxeba.
And you just did it right.	Kwaye wenze nje ukuba kulungile.
The truth is, no one knows for sure.	Inyaniso kukuba, akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He did not know how it happened.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeke njani.
So today.	Ngoko namhlanje.
Sounds like a big deal !.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu!.
They say this will be great fun.	Bathi oku kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
But you should know that.	Kodwa ufanele ukwazi oko.
You will need a large space.	Uya kufuna indawo enkulu.
Finally, you need to go alone.	Ekugqibeleni, kufuneka uhambe wedwa.
He saw why.	Wabona ukuba kutheni.
Go everywhere with me.	Iya yonke indawo nam.
You would have to do it.	Bekuya kufuneka wenze njalo.
He thought he had done a very good job.	Wacinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
Being on time is everything.	Ukufika ngexesha yinto yonke.
I thought badly.	Ndicinge kakubi.
At first it is impossible, it is very difficult.	Ekuqaleni akunakwenzeka, kunzima kakhulu.
However, it happened this way.	Nangona kunjalo, kwenzeka ngolu hlobo.
You read all the time.	Ufunda njalo.
I want to come.	Ndifuna ukuza.
I will do something great.	Ndiza kwenza into enkulu.
It just never really happened.	Kuphela akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene.
And the morning after.	Kwaye kusasa emva.
This goes very well.	Oku kuhamba kakuhle kakhulu.
We will go backwards.	Siza kuhamba ngasemva.
And all will go well.	Kwaye konke kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
I don't think you have to think.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka ucinge.
Really, whatever.	Ngokwenene, nantoni na.
I told her it would be good for her.	Ndamxelela ukuba kuya kuba kuhle kuye.
And thank you, you did well.	Kwaye enkosi, wenze kakuhle.
Well, obviously not.	Kulungile, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I just wanted you to know that.	Bendifuna nje uyazi lonto.
He pulled out something.	Wakhupha into.
He was afraid of what would happen.	Wayesoyika into eza kwenzeka.
He said he did.	Wathi wenza njalo.
Maybe it will be better for you.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono kuwe.
And maybe they did.	Kwaye mhlawumbi baye.
He looked at her.	Wajonga wajonga.
Money is also good.	Imali nayo ilungile.
He tried his number anyway.	Wazama inombolo yakhe kunjalo.
He talked to me all night.	Wathetha nam ubusuku bonke.
There are definitely some.	Kukho abanye ngokuqinisekileyo.
No time at all.	Akukho xesha kwaphela.
He looked down at the woman.	Wajonga phantsi umfazi.
I checked everything with him.	Ndijonge yonke into kunye naye.
I don't know how I did it.	Andiqondi ukuba ndenze njani.
It's just done.	Yenziwe nje.
Or is it? 	Okanye ngaba kunjalo?
This is not a toy.	Le asiyonto yokudlala.
We will not return.	Asiyi kubuya.
Yeah, yeah, really.	Ewe, ewe, ngokwenene.
What's his name?	Ngubani igama lakhe .
Top to bottom.	Phezulu ukuya phantsi.
But that did not always happen.	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke rhoqo.
I learned a lot all day long.	Ndifunde okuninzi imini yonke.
And at the moment there is none.	Kwaye okwangoku akukho.
What did you know.	Ubusazi ntoni.
I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kanye kanye.
He wanted to be first.	Wayefuna ukuba ngowokuqala.
Not if you want to stay here.	Hayi ukuba ufuna ukuhlala apha.
He is our friend now.	Ngumhlobo wethu ngoku.
I will not have any other option.	Andiyi kuba nayo nayiphi na enye indlela.
You really want to play.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukudlala.
Not a bad problem.	Hayi ingxaki embi.
He looked good.	Wayekhangeleka kakuhle.
I can't talk enough about him.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngaye.
But not anyone.	Kodwa hayi nabani na.
So about what they will be.	Ngoko malunga nokuba baya kuba yintoni.
All this and nothing back.	Konke oku kwaye akukho nto emva.
It was clear he had not.	Kwakucacile ukuba akazange.
There seems to be a mistake.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho impazamo.
He started walking with it.	Waqalisa ukuhamba ngayo.
He entered his mother.	Wangena umama wakhe.
You sure have it.	Uqinisekile ukuba unayo.
Do not try to do everything at once.	Musa ukuzama ukwenza yonke into ngexesha elinye.
You have it there.	Unayo apho.
However, he did read many books.	Nangona kunjalo, wafunda iincwadi ezininzi.
You need to do what you think is right.	Kufuneka wenze oko ucinga ukuba kulungile.
Just an image.	Umfanekiso nje.
I want a new one.	Ndifuna entsha.
We know one place.	Siyazi indawo enye.
it's you.	nguwe .
Books if you want.	Iincwadi ukuba uyafuna.
He pulled out a book.	Wakhupha incwadi phezulu.
I will never read again.	Andisayi kuphinda ndifunde.
We will never do that.	Soze senze njalo.
And now this.	Kwaye ngoku le.
And, finally.	Kwaye, ekugqibeleni.
Or indoors.	Okanye ngaphakathi endlwini.
I saw a picture of her.	Ndibone umfanekiso wakhe.
Or it will be soon.	Okanye kuya kuba kungekudala.
Then again, and then.	Emva koko kwakhona, kwaye emva koko.
He arrived in the morning.	Wafika ekuseni.
More on that soon !.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kungekudala!.
But do not die alone.	Kodwa musa ukufa wedwa.
He came to me again.	Ufike kum kwakhona.
He sat inside again.	Wahlala ngaphakathi kwakhona.
Beautiful girl.	Intombi entle.
Yeah, maybe three.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ezintathu.
There is always work.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kukho umsebenzi.
This is the time you are talking about.	Ngeli xesha uthetha ngayo.
I need to know tomorrow.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngomso.
You do not have to bring your friends here.	Akufunekanga uze nabahlobo bakho apha.
He also did not enter the house today.	Naye khange angene endlini namhlanje.
Even if you win, we will stay here.	Nokuba uphumelele, siza kuhlala apha.
He has to be, if he is to succeed.	Kufuneka abe, ukuba uya kuphumelela.
Nobody was going to do that.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuyenza loo nto.
Not yesterday or yesterday before that.	Hayi izolo okanye izolo phambi koko.
And please tell me about yourself.	Kwaye ndicela undixelele ngawe.
I want to talk to your friends.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nabahlobo bakho.
We will not have it here.	Asiyi kuba nayo apha.
That's your thing.	Nantso into yakho.
Unless there are others.	Ngaphandle kokuba kukho abanye.
He would surely come alone.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuza yedwa.
He left yesterday.	Uye wemka izolo.
The police know nothing.	Amapolisa akazi kwanto.
I will do that now.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto ngoku.
In the bedroom, she arrived quickly.	Egumbini lokulala, wafika ngokukhawuleza.
It is a good thing to stop doing it.	Yinto entle ukuyeka ukuyenza.
I know you don't think so.	Ndiyazi awucingi.
Other than that, it's just a thing.	Ngaphandle koko, yinto nje.
Yes, without a good plan.	Ewe, ngaphandle licebo elihle.
He said the same thing.	Wathetha into enye.
This is just obvious.	Oku kubonakala nje.
I thought, yes, that's fine.	Ndacinga, ewe kulungile.
You need to speak clearly.	Kufuneka uthethe ngokucacileyo.
There is no repetition of anything.	Akukho kuphinda kwanto.
But everyone.	Kodwa wonke umntu.
I live inside.	Ndihlala ngaphakathi.
Obviously you can't do this.	Ngokucacileyo awukwazi ukwenza oku.
He always spoke alone.	Wayethetha yedwa rhoqo.
We know why, 'we know how.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni, 'siyazi ukuba njani.
You need to talk to him about it.	Kufuneka uthethe naye ngayo.
You have come at a good time.	Ufike ngexesha elihle.
I know this place is going to be tough.	Ndiyazi ukuba le ndawo iya kuba nzima.
Does it really have to happen today.	Ngaba ngokwenene kufuneka yenzeke namhlanje.
But he was going.	Kodwa wayeza kuya.
Look at you, with that.	Jonga wena, ngaloo nto.
One more thing, it's good for me.	Enye into, ilungile kum.
I think you are very lucky.	Ndicinga ukuba unethamsanqa kakhulu.
But he thought better of it, in the end.	Kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo, ekugqibeleni.
It takes time to get there.	Kuthatha ixesha ukufika apho.
He may have continued.	Usenokuba waqhubeka.
Thank you very much indeed.	Enkosi kakhulu ngenene.
I do not remember anything.	Andikhumbuli kwanto.
I wanted you to do that.	Bendifuna wenze njalo.
I did not want you to know.	Bendingafuni wazi.
Then he ate more.	Emva koko watya ngakumbi.
Old, or new.	Endala, okanye entsha.
I have to do it, and soon.	Kufuneka ndiyenze, kwaye kungekudala.
It should not be difficult.	Akufanele kube nzima.
We will find the one he is talking to.	Siza kufumana lo ethetha naye.
Everything, everything.	Konke, yonke into.
But this one meant everything.	Kodwa lo wayethetha yonke into.
I made a few mistakes, too.	Ndenza iimpazamo ezimbalwa, nam.
You will find many mistakes.	Uya kufumana iimpazamo ezininzi.
Stop thinking about what you did and just do it.	Yeka ukucinga ukuba wenze ntoni kwaye wenze nje.
And he did it himself.	Kwaye wayenza ngokwakhe.
We know something is wrong.	Siyazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
But now he has done it.	Kodwa ngoku uyenzile.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ingxaki.
Or this situation.	Okanye le meko.
She goes to school there.	Uya esikolweni phaya.
He did not know how to do such a thing.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza njani into enjalo.
I'm happy for it.	Ndiyavuya kuyo.
You will not want to leave !.	Awuyi kufuna ukuhamba!.
Otherwise, it is not for us.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho kuthi.
I will want to do it again.	Ndiza kufuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
You deserve to meet him.	Ufanele ukudibana naye.
Or he says he shouldn't have done that.	Okanye uthi bekungafanelanga ayenze lonto.
It will go only one way.	Iza kuhamba indlela enye kuphela.
I don't care, of course.	Andikhathali, kunjalo.
I better do something else.	Kungcono ndenze enye into.
He agreed now.	Wavuma ngoku.
Currently there is no work.	Okwangoku akukho msebenzi.
I never knew what the truth was about this.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba yintoni inyani ngale nto.
You look better with it.	Ukhangeleka ngcono ngayo.
Eventually, she started to look good.	Ekugqibeleni, waqalisa ukuba mhle.
I said too much, or too little.	Ndithethe kakhulu, okanye kancinci kakhulu.
It just takes your time.	Kuthatha nje ixesha lakho.
He talked about it all.	Wathetha ngayo yonke loo nto.
I want to go there.	Ndifuna ukuya apho.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wayenza ngokwenene.
All right, tomorrow.	Kulungile, kusasa.
He needs to eat more.	Kufuneka atye ngakumbi.
I don't care what you do.	andikhathali nokuba wenza ntoni na.
I don't think anyone thought of that.	Andiqondi ukuba akukho mntu wayecinga nto ngaloo nto.
Maybe you're better.	Mhlawumbi ungcono.
I knew nothing about it, you know.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo, uyazi.
If possible, you can't.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka, awukwazi.
Only this is not easy.	Kuphela oku akukho lula.
But not another week or two.	Kodwa hayi enye iveki okanye ezimbini.
Not too long now until it happens.	Hayi ixesha elide ngoku de kwenzeke.
He did a great thing.	Wenza into enkulu.
I can walk more.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba ngakumbi.
I never learned more.	Andizange ndifunde ngakumbi.
He was not far from that.	Akazange abe kude kuloo nto.
I can wait.	Ndiyakwazi ukulinda.
Maybe there is some truth in that.	Mhlawumbi kukho inyaniso kuloo nto.
I don't believe anyone can do that.	Andikholelwa ukuba umntu angayenza loo nto.
He has to think he knows where.	Kufuneka acinge ukuba uyazi apho.
Then he made his mistake.	Emva koko wenza impazamo yakhe.
He stole a ball.	Ube ibhola.
And you have to look for a long time.	Kwaye kufuneka ujonge ixesha elide.
Of course not.	Ngokwenene, akunjalo.
I couldn't do my homework.	Andikwazanga ukwenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo.
But the question is interesting.	Kodwa umbuzo unomdla.
There is just no one.	Akukho mntu nje.
That is why he is here with us.	Yiyo loo nto elapha kunye nathi.
It will last all day.	Iya kuhlala imini yonke.
He pulled his dog out.	Wakhupha inja yakhe phandle.
Maybe there was no problem, after all.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho ngxaki, emva koko.
I have to look again.	Kufuneka ndijonge kwakhona.
You have to say something.	Ufanele ukuthetha into.
Doing the same thing every day.	Ukwenza into efanayo yonke imihla.
So we're going to go and go fast.	Ngoko ke siza kuhamba kwaye sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
He did something new.	Wenza into entsha.
Not now, and probably not.	Hayi ngoku, kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Yes, there is definitely more.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kukho okuninzi ngakumbi.
Look at these.	Jonga ezi.
Now, he said, we want peace.	Ngoku, wathi, sifuna uxolo.
He said he wanted money.	Wathi ufuna imali.
He did not know what to do next.	Wayengazi ukuba uza kwenza ntoni emva koko.
But now it is better.	Kodwa ngoku kungcono ngakumbi.
They will be with me all day long.	Baya kuba nam imini yonke.
I don't care too much either.	Nam andikhathali kakhulu.
You want to know your truth.	Ufuna ukwazi inyaniso yakho.
After a while, you just feel it.	Emva kwexesha, uziva nje.
However, it was not necessary that.	Nangona kunjalo, kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba.
The food is always good.	Ukutya kuhlala kulungile.
There is a reason for this.	Kukho isizathu sokuba kube njalo.
My son can't go home.	Unyana wam akakwazi ukuya ekhaya.
I never have to see him again.	Akufunekanga ndiphinde ndimbone.
She is the mother.	Nguye umama.
I will say so.	Ndiza kuthetha njalo.
Thank you so much for this.	Enkosi kakhulu kuwe ngale nto.
I haven’t heard anything from it yet.	Andizange ndive nto kuyo nangona kunjalo.
That never happened here.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto apha.
The doctor was not there.	Ugqirha wayengekho.
I learned to sing.	Ndifunde ukucula.
She looked down at her mother.	Wajonga phantsi umama wakhe.
There was no reason for him to act this way.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba enze ngolu hlobo.
Hard work to get there.	Ukusebenza nzima ukuya apho.
And all that now.	Kwaye yonke loo nto ngoku.
We will be one with each other.	Siza kuba omnye komnye.
I lived too long there.	Ndihlale ixesha elide kakhulu apho.
I can't wait to do this again !.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukwenza oku kwakhona!.
I may have made a mistake.	Inokuba ndenze impazamo.
His mistake, he thought.	Impazamo yakhe, wacinga.
She looked at him.	Uye wajonga kuye.
He came to our house.	Wafika endlini yethu.
It is finally necessary.	Kufuneka ekugqibeleni.
Maybe they will do that.	Mhlawumbi baya kuyenza loo nto.
Probably with her children.	Mhlawumbi nabantwana bakhe.
Just a problem.	Ingxaki nje.
And you and me.	Kwaye wena kunye nam.
I want it for myself.	Ndifuna mna ngokwam.
They have stayed in our house for dinner.	Baye bahlala endlini yethu ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
I can't wait for my food.	Andikwazi kulinda ukutya kwam.
But this, this.	Kodwa oku, oku.
To this day, that is the case.	Kude kube namhlanje, oko kunjalo.
He was not alone, after all.	Yayingenguye yedwa, emva koko.
Maybe if you wait too long.	Mhlawumbi ukuba ulinde ixesha elide.
Controversy erupts.	Utata wavuma.
I would like to see your location.	Ndingathanda ukubona indawo yakho.
No one said anything about it.	Akukho mntu wathetha nto ngaloo nto.
Very nice place to stay.	Indawo entle kakhulu yokuhlala.
Let me look at you.	Makhe ndijonge kuwe.
My mother is a teacher.	Umama ngutitshala.
He didn't think about it at the time.	Wayengacingi nto ngaloo nto ngelo xesha.
Well, for lunch then.	Kulungile, ngesidlo sasemini ke .
Now just tonight.	Ngoku ngokuhlwa kanye.
He is up here.	Ulapha phezulu.
Yes, this is possible.	Ewe, oku kunokwenzeka.
But you did not.	Kodwa awuzange ube.
Exactly why, he could not speak.	Kanye ukuba kutheni, akazange akwazi ukuthetha.
And it will be the first.	Kwaye iya kuba ngowokuqala.
I wanted to do it that way.	Ndandifuna ukwenza ngolo hlobo.
This will be difficult enough.	Oku kuya kuba nzima ngokwaneleyo.
Not so with children today.	Akunjalo abantwana namhlanje.
Not everyone will do that.	Akunjalo ukuba wonke umntu uya kwenza loo nto.
And then we did it quickly.	Kwaye ke siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
He looked everywhere except her.	Wajonga kuyo yonke indawo ngaphandle kwakhe.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ungcono kusasa.
He pretends he doesn't want to give up.	Wenza ngathi akafuni ukuyeka.
Really, there is no danger.	Ngokwenene, akukho ngozi.
I will not say no.	Andiyi kuthi hayi.
The one laying here in front of him.	Lowo ulele apha phambi kwakhe.
It's a great thing to drive.	Yinto entle kakhulu ukuqhuba.
But he was also afraid of something else, something bigger.	Kodwa wayesoyika enye into, into enkulu ngakumbi.
He left early.	Wemka kwangethuba.
I'm going up there.	Ndiya phezulu phaya.
Not that anyone will speak.	Akunjalo ukuba nabani na uya kuthetha.
He lives inside.	Uhlala ngaphakathi.
No, my.	Akunjalo, wethu.
Well, well enough.	Kulungile, kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
Then he became angry with her.	Emva koko waba nomsindo kuye.
I'll tell him, though.	Ndiza kumxelela, nangona kunjalo.
He cannot do it alone.	Akanakuyenza yedwa.
We never did the same thing.	Asizange senze into efanayo.
He wanted very badly.	Wayefuna kakubi kakhulu.
Or I can talk about it.	Okanye ndikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
Yes he ran away.	Ewe wabaleka.
Then, you will be alone.	Emva koko, uya kuba yedwa.
I need a place to stay.	Ndifuna indawo yokuhlala.
I am very sorry for everything.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngayo yonke into.
He used to do that with her.	Wayedla ngokwenza oko naye.
People need it.	Abantu kufuneka.
But you do not have to come.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uze.
Whatever happens will happen to both of us.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo iya kwenzeka kuthi sobabini.
But for me it is not that easy.	Kodwa kum akukho lula ngolo hlobo.
Not three hours.	Hayi iiyure ezintathu.
The cat probably.	Ikati mhlawumbi.
Not all work.	Hayi wonke umsebenzi.
He thinks of us.	Ucinga ngathi.
If he only knew all that.	Ukuba wayesazi yonke loo nto.
Now my problem.	Ngoku ingxaki yam.
I know everything about him now.	Ndiyazi yonke into ngaye ngoku.
Great job here, too.	Umsebenzi omkhulu apha, kwakhona.
I have to think a little bit.	Kufuneka ndicinge kancinci.
Not like you're talking about it.	Hayi ngathi uthetha ngayo.
No one knew until now.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kude kube ngoku.
I want the same thing out.	Ndifuna into efanayo ngaphandle.
But like he never was here.	Kodwa ngathi akazange abe lapha.
It's you, but you don't look like that.	Nguwe, kodwa awubonakali unjalo.
But this is not necessary at all.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
We went very well.	Sihambe kakuhle kakhulu.
At night .	Ebusuku .
He is here to do something.	Ulapha ukwenza into.
I thought something was up, but nothing happened.	Ndandicinga ukuba kukho into eza kuthetha nam, kodwa akuzange kwenzeke nto.
No one wanted to know.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi.
No, not long ago.	Hayi, kungekudala.
He certainly does not like it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akayithandi.
Not as you think, though.	Akunjalo njengoko ucinga, nangona kunjalo.
I think there is a story.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho ibali.
Please tell her.	Ndicela umxelele.
You don't have to go to that.	Akuyomfuneko ukuya kuloo nto.
I've always been able to do that.	Bendisoloko ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I don't remember another car.	Andikhumbuli enye imoto.
Then no one was there.	Emva koko kwakungekho mntu apho.
I will do better this time.	Ndiza kwenza ngcono ngakumbi ngeli xesha.
And in the end, he never succeeded.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni, akazange aphumelele ngaphezu kwakhe.
And dinner if you want.	Kwaye isidlo sangokuhlwa ukuba uyafuna.
Living here means death anyway.	Ukuhlala apha kuthetha ukufa nokuba kunjalo.
But do nothing now.	Kodwa musa ukwenza nto ngoku.
Maybe right up there.	Mhlawumbi kanye phaya phezulu.
No one really knew what was wrong with him, either.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene ukuba yintoni engalunganga kuye, naye.
Let me go with you.	Makhe ndihambe nawe.
Another bedroom.	Elinye igumbi lokulala.
He did not arrive in the afternoon.	Akazange afike emva kwemini.
Maybe someone else, then.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu, ngoko.
Well done, very well.	Wenze kakuhle, kakuhle kakhulu.
But he looks bad.	Kodwa ukhangeleka ngathi wenza kakubi.
So you expect something else.	Ngoko ulindele enye into.
You mean it.	Uthetha yona.
Much more, obviously.	Okuninzi ngakumbi, ngokucacileyo.
I know it will be difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
He expects you to do that.	Ulindele ukuba wenze loo nto.
But many.	Kodwa abaninzi.
This will not be true.	Oku akuyi kuba yinyani.
He spent many years in prison.	Wachitha iminyaka emininzi entolongweni.
I'm tired, in a good way.	Ndidiniwe, ngendlela elungileyo.
Maybe, you know.	Mhlawumbi, uyazi.
I just want to think about my job.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndicinge ngomsebenzi wam.
He only knew it was true.	Wayesazi kuphela ukuba yinyani.
That will be all of it.	Kuya kuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
Nothing happened up there.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo phaya phezulu.
But that comes with time.	Kodwa oko kuza kunye nexesha.
I'm really looking forward to dinner tonight.	Ndijonge ngenene isidlo sangokuhlwa ngale ngokuhlwa.
This may be true for the rest of my life or not.	Oku kunokuba yinyani ubomi bam bonke okanye akunjalo.
I tried to get him to go with me.	Ndazama ukuba ahambe nam.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni .
You just look so alone.	Ukhangeleka wedwa nje.
Your doctor is not like that.	Ugqirha wakho akanjalo.
No there is not.	Hayi, akukho.
But you need to know a few things.	Kodwa kufuneka wazi izinto ezimbalwa.
More time.	Ixesha elingakumbi.
Nobody said you had to go somewhere.	Akukho mntu uthe kufuneka uye ndawo.
My mistake is probably.	Impazamo yam mhlawumbi.
Just one ball.	Ibhola enye nje.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, nguye ngokwenene.
I tried to be away.	Ndazama ukuba kude.
I will do this again and again and again and again.	Ndiza kuyenza le nto kwakhona kwaye kwaye kwaye kwaye kwakhona.
He knew all the time.	Wayesazi lonke ixesha.
The doctor must decide on this.	Ugqirha umele enze isigqibo ngaloo nto.
Why here? 	Kutheni apha?
Not later now, not to him.	Akukho kamva ngoku, hayi kuye.
But here, there is a problem.	Kodwa apha, kukho ingxaki.
He feels it all.	Uziva konke.
Now, all kids have to go to college.	Ngoku, bonke abantwana kufuneka baye ekholejini.
So there is no money.	Ngoko ke akukho mali.
I had to look up.	Kwafuneka ndijonge phezulu.
And that's okay, because he's not really there.	Kwaye oko kulungile, kuba akakho ngokwenene.
I really want to take this job.	Ngokwenene, ndifuna ukuthatha lo msebenzi.
Not you and me.	Akukho mna nawe.
He looked at things.	Wajonga izinto.
But this is not about me and you.	Kodwa oku akukho malunga nam nawe.
And then we'll see.	Kwaye ke siza kubona.
That's the problem, really.	Nantso ingxaki, ngokwenene.
But it will not happen.	Kodwa akuyi kwenzeka.
Or last night.	Okanye phezolo.
It is more likely that it will be true.	Kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ukuba kuya kuba yinyani.
Look at this.	Jonga le nto.
How, he didn't know.	Njani, wayengazi.
I never saw anyone else all the time.	Andizange ndibone omnye umntu ngalo lonke ixesha.
He thought he was smart.	Wayecinga ukuba ukrelekrele.
You will have money.	Uzakuba nayo imali.
Maybe or not.	Mhlawumbi okanye hayi.
And then people.	Kwaye ke abantu.
Maybe you're thinking about him now.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ngaye ngoku.
No, no, soon you will be here.	Hayi, hayi, kungekudala uza kuba lapha.
Waiting all night.	Ukulinda ubusuku bonke.
If he has to succeed.	Ukuba kufuneka aphumelele.
He sits in the back.	Uhlala ngasemva.
Only, it was not.	Kuphela, kwakungekho.
I look up again.	Ndiphinde ndijonge phezulu.
Just tell me you'll be there.	Ndixelele nje ukuba uzakuba lapho.
Seeing is everything.	Ukubona yinto yonke.
The only question is how bad you are.	Umbuzo kuphela kukuba uya kuyenza kakubi kangakanani.
I learned many other things, too.	Ndifunde ezinye izinto ezininzi, nam.
At first he thought he was a man.	Ekuqaleni wayecinga ukuba yindoda.
At first he knew nothing.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi nto.
Everyone is looking at me now.	Wonke umntu ujonge kum ngoku.
Up, and in the office.	Phezulu, kwaye eofisini.
She is beautiful, as she is.	Mhle, njengoko unjalo.
Then he came to work.	Wafika ke emsebenzini.
Your dad wants you to do that.	Utata wakho ufuna wenze njalo.
The only place, really.	Indawo kuphela, ngokwenene.
He will do it, for now.	Uza kwenza, okwangoku.
And another message.	Kwaye omnye umyalezo.
I think so, yes.	Ndicinga njalo, ewe.
You just have to go to it.	Kufuneka nje uye kuyo.
He pulled out a letter.	Wakhupha ileta.
He went almost too far.	Uhambe phantse kakhulu.
John after that.	UJohn emva koko.
He will have to tell her.	Kuya kufuneka amxelele.
Or are you doing something you have to do.	Okanye ngaba wenza into ekufuneka uyenzile.
His house.	Indlu yakhe.
He was not as difficult as everyone thought.	Wayengekho nzima njengoko wonke umntu wayecinga.
He will go.	Uza kuhamba.
Everyone wants something better.	Wonke umntu ufuna into engcono.
It must have been very difficult for you.	Kumele ukuba kunzima kakhulu kuwe.
And there are, but not in the right way.	Kwaye kukho, kodwa hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
I do not remember exactly when.	Andikhumbuli ukuba nini kanye kanye.
But it happened to me anyway.	Kodwa kwenzeka kum kunjalo.
Really, for a long time.	Ngokwenene, ixesha elide.
Lots of encounters.	Ukudibana okuninzi.
I want to work, but not as you think.	Ndifuna ukusebenza, kodwa hayi njengoko ucinga.
Or, maybe not.	Okanye, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
No one has ever been there.	Akukho mntu ukhe waya apho.
Because I would like to get a job.	Kuba ndingathanda ukufumana umsebenzi.
I think you know the place.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi indawo.
You can do that today if you like.	Ungayenza loo nto namhlanje ukuba uyathanda.
Money to do whatever he really wants, when he wants to.	Imali yokwenza nantoni na ayifunayo ngokwenene, xa efuna.
He said he was.	Uye wathi nguye.
But only in time.	Kodwa kuphela ngexesha.
And it didn't hurt.	Kwaye akuzange kube buhlungu.
Or your mother or anyone.	Okanye umama wakho okanye nabani na.
No, maybe not.	Hayi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But you don't want to be with me enough.	Kodwa awufuni ukuba nam ngokwaneleyo.
He did a good job doing that.	Wenza umsebenzi omhle ngokwenza oko.
But they will talk, no matter what happens.	Kodwa baya kuthetha, nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
It's up to you, of course.	Kuze kuwe, kunjalo.
He would.	Wayeza .
You don't have to say anything in the city.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uthethe nantoni na edolophini.
He left, but soon he left.	Wahamba, kodwa kungekudala wemka.
I think you are doing well.	Ndicinga ukuba uhamba kakuhle.
However, it is possible.	Nangona kunjalo, kusenokwenzeka.
I don't know how I did this.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani oku.
We want to do more.	Sifuna ukwenza okuninzi ngakumbi.
You have it the other way around.	Unayo ngenye indlela.
She felt a little better.	Waziva engcono kancinci.
Because, that's fine.	Ngokuba, kulungile.
Or when you think about it.	Okanye xa ucinga ngayo.
That makes you a picture.	Oko kukwenza umfanekiso.
But certainly not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho.
You do not really want to know what happened next.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
And it's really hard.	Kwaye kunzima ngokwenene.
If you are here with me.	Ukuba ulapha kunye nam.
That, yes.	Lowo, ewe.
But there is no way out.	Kodwa akukho ukuphuma kuyo.
Because you know what the truth is.	Kuba uyazi ukuba yintoni inyaniso.
But he knew how.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba njani.
She looked at him quickly.	Wajonga ngaye ngokukhawuleza.
I want to live in the city.	Ndifuna ukuhlala edolophini.
Not just taking, despite the name.	Hayi nje ukuthatha, nangona igama.
He says sorry.	Uthi uxolo.
And so it is.	Kwaye kunjalo oku.
There is no question at all about that.	Akukho mbuzo kwaphela ngaloo nto.
What's next.	Yintoni ezayo.
As if.	Ngoku, ngathi.
If he wanted better.	Ukuba wayefuna ngcono.
Or, more specifically, a cat.	Okanye, ngakumbi, ikati.
He has gone up.	Uye waya phezulu.
So he would take his time.	Ngoko wayeza kuthatha ixesha lakhe.
But you will get better.	Kodwa uya kuba ngcono.
I do not remember the music.	Andikhumbuli umculo.
Just once for him.	Kanye nje kuye.
Everyone is my friend.	Wonke umntu ngumhlobo wam.
He will stay with you.	Uya kuhlala nawe.
That happened next.	Oko kwenzeka emva koko.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga lonto.
And he is very smart.	Kwaye ukrelekrele kakhulu.
Someone or.	Umntu okanye.
I'm sure others will.	Ndiqinisekile abanye baya kwenza njalo.
If you want to know what it is.	Ukuba ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
He is talking only about you.	Uthetha ngawe kuphela.
We are not far away.	Asiyi kude.
But if you have to do it, you can do it.	Kodwa ukuba kufuneka uyenze, ungayenza.
However, this is not really the case.	Nokuba kunjalo, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Yes, he will do a good job.	Ewe, uya kwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
Same place last week.	Indawo efanayo kwiveki ephelileyo.
So getting in front of someone will take a lot of work.	Ngoko ukufika phambi komnye kuya kuthatha umsebenzi.
I can't do this, he thought, again and again.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku, wacinga, kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
You did a really good thing.	Wenze into elungileyo ngenene.
It's hard, you know.	Kunzima, uyazi.
He stayed great.	Wahlala enkulu.
He sat back again.	Wahlala emva kwakhona.
Today or tomorrow.	Namhlanje okanye ngomso.
I didn't want that.	Ndandingafuni ngolo hlobo.
It would be hard for him.	Bekuya kuba nzima kuye.
I think it would be good to do.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle ukwenza.
He fell asleep with music.	Walala umculo.
He came back in front of me.	Wabuyela phambi kwam.
I don't even know.	Andazi nokuba ndiyazi.
Then you told me what this is.	Emva koko undixelele ukuba yintoni le nto.
You should not be with me.	Akufanele ube nam.
Well the big problem.	Kulungile ingxaki enkulu.
Not in front of him.	Hayi phambi kwakhe.
It takes up little space.	Kuthatha indawo encinci.
Well, maybe he would like to.	Ewe, mhlawumbi angathanda.
That is strange to me.	Yinto engaqhelekanga kum leyo.
Or, really.	Okanye, ngokwenene.
He has said things.	Uye wathetha izinto.
We have never done that before.	Asizange siyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
Then you made a mistake.	Emva koko wenze impazamo.
Well if you do that.	Kulungile ukuba uyayenza loo nto.
Everyone is doing a great job.	Wonke umntu wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
I don't know how long exactly that time.	Andazi ukuba ixesha elingakanani kanye kanye.
And not so much the other way around.	Kwaye hayi kakhulu ngenye indlela.
Yes, it can be fun to play together.	Ewe, kunokuba mnandi ukudlala kunye.
He wanted friends.	Wayefuna abahlobo.
Learning to walk.	Ukufunda ukuhamba.
Then a little bit.	Emva koko kancinci.
You have to stay in the room.	Kufuneka uhlale egumbini.
I hope it will be good.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
I just love the place.	Ndiyayithanda nje indawo.
I've always been here for you.	Bendisoloko ndilapha ngenxa yakho.
I can walk slowly.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba kancinci.
Yes, you look like him.	Ewe, ufana naye.
I start here.	Ndiyaqala apha.
Today with me.	Namhlanje nam.
That is why we must do this.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka senze oku.
He would speak first.	Wayeza kuqala athethe.
It will be easy to do.	Kuya kuba lula ukwenza.
Tell everyone about it.	Xelela wonke umntu ngayo.
One.	Omnye .
He also did not mention it.	Naye akazange athethe ngayo.
You do not have to know the name beforehand.	Akuyomfuneko ukwazi igama ngaphambili.
Very good there.	Kuhle kakhulu apho.
But it will take a very long time.	Kodwa kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
Although not in the right way.	Nangona hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
I love my little girl so much, so much.	Ndiyayithanda intombi yam encinci kakhulu, kakhulu.
So your peace.	Ngoko uxolo lwakho.
I'm so sorry this happened to you.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngoku kwenzeke kuwe.
This situation will require that.	Le meko iza kufuna oko.
We will not walk without him.	Asiyi kuhamba ngaphandle kwakhe.
See if you do.	Jonga ukuba uyayenza na.
You do not have to sit here alone.	Akufunekanga ukuba uhleli naye apha yedwa.
Where you like.	Apho uthanda khona.
And not at night.	Kwaye hayi ebusuku.
Because he thought he should.	Kuba wayecinga ukuba ufanele.
But there is only me here.	Kodwa kukho mna kuphela apha.
Bad old place.	Indawo endala embi.
He will be with her.	Uya kuba naye.
Again, not that hard to answer.	Kwakhona, hayi ukuba nzima impendulo.
I would like to tell you why.	Ndingathanda ukukuxelela ukuba kutheni.
He’s not going to, though.	Akayi, nangona kunjalo.
But that is not the problem.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo ingxaki leyo.
Now no one is going to talk to me.	Ngoku akukho mntu uza kuthetha nam.
I have never been able to buy this.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthenga ngolu hlobo.
That really, really hard to do.	Oko ngokwenene, kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza.
However I do not remember how.	Nangona kunjalo andikhumbuli ukuba njani.
Then they will want.	Emva koko baya kufuna.
Thinking about where you are now.	Ukucinga ukuba uphi ngoku .
At home today.	Ekhaya namhlanje.
I will not be like that.	Andisayi kuba njalo.
I really wanted to go.	Ndandifuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
Check back soon.	Jonga kwakhona kungekudala.
There is a problem here.	Kukho ingxaki ethile apha.
I love his style of play.	Ndiyayithanda indlela yakhe yokudlala.
You just have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka uyenzile nje.
Like, no one knows.	Njengoko, akukho mntu uyazi.
In the afternoon at home.	Emva kwemini ekhaya.
Some clearly are not.	Abanye ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
It's all there.	Konke kukho.
But you need to know something.	Kodwa kufuneka wazi into.
So he has to come.	Ngoko kufuneka afike.
It's just a little good.	Kulungile nje kancinci.
Everything you need to know is right here.	Yonke into ekufuneka uyazi ilungile apha.
Too many questions, perhaps.	Imibuzo emininzi kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
He must have slept all day, he realized.	Umele ukuba walala imini yonke, waqonda.
My new job is better for me.	Umsebenzi wam omtsha ungcono kum.
You will be home soon.	Uza kufika ekhaya ngokukhawuleza.
And he doesn't want time.	Kwaye akafuni xesha.
Some say, no.	Abanye bathi, hayi.
He didn't know what was wrong.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
Man before his time.	Umntu ngaphambi kwexesha lakhe.
All his good work will continue.	Wonke umsebenzi wakhe olungileyo ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuqhubeka.
It will be the only way.	Kuya kuba ngendlela kuphela.
Why did this happen? '.	Kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oku?'.
So very, very little money.	Ngoko kakhulu, imali encinci kakhulu.
I just wanted a chance.	Bendifuna nje ithuba.
Probably not.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba akunjalo.
Or anyone else.	Okanye nabani na omnye.
That is good or bad.	Oko kulungile okanye kulungile.
That seems old-fashioned.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kudala.
There was absolutely no one.	Kwakungekho mntu ngokupheleleyo.
You have to make mistakes.	Kufuneka wenze iimpazamo.
That is exactly the problem.	Yiloo ngxaki kanye.
My father was not with her.	Utata wayengekho naye.
We will take these.	Siza kuthatha ezi .
He just agreed.	Wavuma nje.
He wants nothing.	Akafuni nto.
He is very interested in me.	Unomdla kakhulu kum.
Now we have to do it.	Ngoku kufuneka senze.
Otherwise it is good.	Ngaphandle koko kuhle.
I think that's fine with me.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kum.
There was nobody back there.	Kwakungekho mntu phaya emva.
Just a little bit.	Ukuba nje kancinci.
I think it's time for me to go.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha lokuba ndihambe.
I live for him.	Ndihlala ngenxa yakhe.
Yeah, all that.	Ewe, yonke loo nto.
He did not admit it to her.	Akazange avume oko kuye.
Nothing will create a problem.	Akukho nto iya kudala ingxaki.
Now the question.	Ngoku umbuzo.
My mother is so beautiful.	Umama wam mhle kakhulu.
He wanted her to think again.	Wayefuna ukuba aphinde acinge.
They will come.	Baza kufika.
Not just one.	Hayi nje enye.
Just food.	Ukutya nje.
I don't see why this could be.	Andiboni ukuba kutheni le nto ingaba njalo.
Stop trying so hard.	Yeka nje ukuzama nzima.
I don't even want to be here.	Andifuni nokuba lapha.
Unable to control himself, he fell asleep.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba, walala.
Maybe he can't.	Mhlawumbi akakwazi.
No one came first.	Akukho mntu weza kuqala.
I have to be with him.	Kufuneka ndibe naye.
You will not see many mistakes in him.	Awuyi kubona iimpazamo ezininzi kuye.
I would like to learn how.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ukuba njani.
Today, we have done a few things.	Namhlanje, senze izinto ezimbalwa.
All right, all right for me.	Kulungile, kulungile kum.
I couldn't do it now, of course.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza ngoku, kunjalo.
I think you went slow.	Ndicinga ukuba uhambe kancinci.
The wife.	Umfazi .
I'm glad you did that.	Ndiyavuya uyenzile loo nto.
It's not me at the moment.	Ayindim ngeli xesha.
I could not stop at the time.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyeka ngexesha.
We didn't do that all the time.	Asizange siyenze loo nto ixesha lonke.
And so, that starts with us.	Kwaye ke, oko kuqala kuthi.
Suddenly you know.	Ngokukhawuleza uyazi.
I thought that was a good idea.	Ndacinga ukuba licebo elihle elo.
I'll tell her later.	Ndiza kumxelela kamva.
Yesterday was supposed to be.	Izolo bekufanele ukuba yiyo.
This is good.	Kuhle oku.
There was no need for him to be here.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba abe lapha.
He said he wanted to come.	Wathi ufuna ukuza.
Living there is something else.	Ukuhlala apho kukho enye into.
I'm not sure, now.	Andiqinisekanga, ngoku.
Both my parents live at home.	Abazali bam bobabini bahlala ekhaya.
But ourselves.	Kodwa ngokwethu.
It would be a thing.	Bekuya kuba yinto.
Going to dinner.	Ukuya kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
If you are looking for a place to stay.	Ukuba ufuna indawo yokuhlala.
He went very badly last week.	Uhambe kakubi kakhulu kwiveki ephelileyo.
In the meantime, we should both go.	Okwangoku, kufuneka sihambe sobabini.
He said things.	Wathetha izinto.
But you can do it.	Kodwa ungayenza loo nto.
He works to the death.	Usebenza ukufa.
And there is a cat there.	Kwaye kukho ikati apho.
This is not a problem at all.	Oku akukho ngxaki kwaphela apho.
They will wait a long time.	Baya kulinda ixesha elide.
He arrived last night.	Ufike phezolo.
He ran away from you, he ran away from you.	Wabaleka wemka kwakho, wabaleka kuwe.
He wants you to come.	Ufuna ukuba uze.
He went into a house and sat down.	Wangena endlini wahlala phantsi.
There is, however, a problem.	Kukho, nangona kunjalo, ingxaki.
Unless it never happened that way.	Ngaphandle kokuba akuzange kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
It's really hard to do well.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza kakuhle.
I think of you and the children every day.	Ndicinga ngawe kunye nabantwana yonke imihla.
Good job for me.	Umsebenzi omhle mna.
Trying to learn more.	Ukuzama ukufunda ngakumbi.
All of this is going to happen.	Konke oku kuza kwenzeka.
Someone wanted to talk to her.	Umntu wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
But that happened after a long time.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka emva kwexesha elide.
I have only done three.	Ndenze ezintathu kuphela.
Stay here.	Uhlale apha.
But it seems hard.	Kodwa kubonakala kunzima.
Yeah, one more thing.	Ewe, enye into.
You drive the place.	Uqhuba indawo.
Better quickly than later, of course.	Kungcono ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva, kunjalo.
I mean soon.	Ndithetha ukuba kungekudala.
The truth is, he really did.	Inyaniso kukuba, ngokwenene wenza.
That's why you always look.	Yiyo loo nto uhlala ujonge.
He does not know the truth.	Akayazi inyani.
I thought it was so much better.	Ndandicinga ukuba kungcono kakhulu.
I mean work.	Ndithetha umsebenzi.
Something done.	Yenziwe into.
I did not go to the hospital.	Khange ndiye esibhedlele.
Impossible to purchase.	Akunakwenzeka ukuthenga.
Now, it.	Ngoku, yona.
Now it seems like people.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi abantu.
We will definitely be back again !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kubuya kwakhona!.
Imagine what it would be like inside.	Ukucinga ukuba kuya kuba njani ngaphakathi.
Time and time with us today.	Ixesha nexesha kunye nathi namhlanje.
That happened so quickly.	Oko kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
He wanted his room again.	Wayefuna igumbi lakhe kwakhona.
So we did this ourselves.	Ngoko ke le nto siyenze ngokwethu .
I've been away for a very long time.	Ndihambe ixesha elide kakhulu.
Obviously, he told me a lot about her.	Ngokucacileyo, wandixelela okuninzi ngaye.
I don't know how I can do anything else.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani enye into.
Not at all.	Akukho ngokupheleleyo.
But it seemed.	Kodwa kwakubonakala ngathi kukho.
I doubt that will ever happen.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba iya kuze yenzeke loo nto.
Happy dad.	Uyavuya utata.
Not for me anyway.	Hayi kum kunjalo.
We didn’t, really.	Asizange senze, ngokwenene.
Tell me who's behind you and why.	Ndixelele ukuba ngubani na emva kwakho kwaye kutheni.
This is really a big deal.	Oku ngenene yinto enkulu.
He lay down on his bed.	Walala ebhedini yakhe.
I've heard of it.	Ndikhe ndeva ngayo.
I always try the same place.	Ndihlala ndizama indawo enye.
I live in my room a lot.	Ndihlala egumbini lam kakhulu.
I want to say something to you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha into kuwe.
It is clear to me what is going on.	Kucacile kum ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I made a living there, though.	Ndenze ubomi apho, nangona kunjalo.
It won’t be easy, though.	Akuyi kuba lula, nangona kunjalo.
It would be good to talk.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba uthethe.
I think you are interested in him.	Ndicinga ukuba unomdla kuye.
But a little sad for me.	Kodwa kancinci buhlungu kum.
Sorry we did.	Uxolo senze.
My mother stayed with him.	Umama wahlala naye.
Then, you will be at the beginning.	Emva koko, uya kuba ekuqaleni.
Thanks for being here !.	Enkosi ngokuba lapha!.
He spoke the truth.	Wathetha inyaniso.
Thus outside.	Ngaloo ndlela ngaphandle.
Anything unless you are traveling alone.	Nantoni na ngaphandle kokuba uhamba wedwa.
It's not very easy.	Akukho lula kakhulu.
I want to go with you and be with you.	Ndifuna ukuhamba nawe ndibe nawe.
I'll bring it.	Ndiza nayo.
This is evident throughout the book.	Oku kubonakala kuyo yonke le ncwadi.
We should not have done anything about it.	Bekungafanelanga senze nto ngaloo nto.
He just wanted to go faster.	Wayefuna nje ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe I went too far with you.	Mhlawumbi ndihambe kakhulu nawe.
Where he went, what he did.	Apho waya khona, wenza ntoni.
But people.	Kodwa abantu.
And now, too.	Kwaye ngoku, nawe.
But he stayed away.	Kodwa wahlala kude.
He has taken.	Uye wathatha .
Do you have to do some work?	Ngaba kufuneka wenze umsebenzi?
They will get one.	Baza kufumana enye.
You must be tired.	Kufuneka ukuba udiniwe.
His mother thought that was a good idea.	Umama wakhe wayecinga ukuba licebo elihle elo.
If you want life.	Ukuba ufuna ubomi.
Very nice car.	Imoto entle kakhulu.
Because the work is good.	Ngenxa yokuba umsebenzi ulungile.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Ukuthetha ngayo, kuya kuba kuhle ngoku.
Either way, you can do something.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, uyakwazi ukwenza into.
You shouldn’t be at work, for sure.	Akufanele ube emsebenzini, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He was afraid to do it alone.	Wayesoyika ukwenza yedwa.
Also a great picture.	Kwakhona umfanekiso omkhulu.
You are always lucky.	Uhlala unethamsanqa.
Just to see how you do.	Ukubona nje ukuba uqhuba njani.
It is unlikely that it will be the case.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba nokuba kunjalo.
Whenever you want to talk.	Nanini na xa ufuna ukuthetha.
I didn't want to take that approach.	Ndandingafuni ukuthatha loo ndlela.
When your food arrives you will see why.	Xa ukutya kwakho kufika uya kubona ukuba kutheni.
We will have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka senze.
She can't stop thinking about him.	Akakwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngaye.
You should go with me, right away.	Kufuneka uhambe nam, ngoko nangoko.
His life or yours.	Ubomi bakhe okanye bakho.
I'm so happy right now.	Ndiyavuya ngoko ngoku.
Maybe someday, maybe someday soon.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini, mhlawumbi ngenye imini kungekudala.
So, let's be.	Ngoko, makhe sibe.
If not, you will not.	Ukuba akunjalo, awuyi.
As it would be.	Njengokuba bekuya kuba njalo.
Her mother opened the door.	Umama wakhe wavula ucango.
So he says yes.	Ngoko uthi ewe.
Music has a similar problem.	Umculo unengxaki efanayo.
And again, these are just some of the goal setting shareware that you can use.	Kwaye kwakhona, kulungile kuwe ukuba uyayithanda.
Not to me, but to you.	Hayi kum, kodwa kuwe.
We will never do it again.	Asiyi kuyenza kwakhona.
Tell me how it happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke njani.
No one reads that.	Akukho mntu ufunda loo nto.
So much we all know.	Kakhulu siyazi sonke.
But not at the same time.	Kodwa hayi ngexesha elinye.
But he kept going.	Kodwa waqhubeka kunjalo.
No one has ever said such a thing.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha into enjalo.
I try to take something every day.	Ndizama ukuthatha into yonke imihla.
And yes, it will be here.	Kwaye ewe, iya kuba apha.
We had to leave.	Kwafuneka sihambe.
His wife .	Umfazi wakhe .
Yes, yes, and yes.	Ewe, ewe, kwaye ewe.
Other than that, everything is fine to go.	Ngaphandle koko, yonke into ilungile ukuhamba.
Everyone is busy.	Wonke umntu uxakekile.
I did not know what the answer might be.	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba yintoni impendulo.
Everyone thought he was smart and intelligent.	Wonke umntu wayecinga ukuba ukrelekrele kwaye ukrelekrele.
He did it himself.	Wayenza ngokwakhe.
Yes there is something wrong.	Ewe kukho into engalunganga.
But in his time.	Kodwa ngexesha lakhe.
Certainly if you do that regularly.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ukwenza oko rhoqo.
Not so at the time.	Akunjalo ngelo xesha.
I know my answer.	Ndiyayazi impendulo yam.
We want you to get dressed and go with us.	Sifuna unxibe uhambe nathi.
This is difficult for him.	Oku kunzima kuye.
He asked me how he knew.	Wandibuza ukuba uyazi njani.
Doing so makes this impossible.	Ukwenjenjalo kwenza ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
Just, you did well.	Nje, wenze kakuhle.
In this case it did not happen.	Kule meko akuzange kwenzeke.
That's right, yes.	Yinyani leyo, ewe.
He does not know exactly why he is coming.	Akasazi ngokucacileyo isizathu sokuba eze.
You don’t think too much about it.	Awucingi kakhulu ngayo.
People live somewhere.	Abantu bahlala kwindawo ethile.
She almost ran into him.	Uphantse wabaleka wangena kuye.
Yes this can be difficult.	Ewe oku kunokuba nzima.
It will be early.	Kuya kwangethuba.
However, this is not the case here.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo apha.
There he is.	Naye ke lowo.
He wanted to know two things.	Wayefuna ukwazi izinto ezimbini.
I better do it alone.	Kungcono ndiyenze ndedwa.
That's the whole situation.	Yiloo meko yonke.
You did well there.	Wenze kakuhle apho.
But great man if you know.	Kodwa umntu omkhulu ukuba uyazi.
Complete self-control.	Ukuzibamba ngokupheleleyo.
But he is a man.	Kodwa yindoda.
You did everything well.	Uyenze yonke into kakuhle.
I want to go to school.	Ndifuna ukuya esikolweni.
Someone please help.	Umntu ndicela uncedo.
I will talk as long as it takes.	Ndiza kuthetha ixesha elide njengoko kuthatha.
Let me say one thing.	Makhe ndithethe into enye.
So, two things.	Ngoko, izinto ezimbini.
I think there is something in it, though.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into kuyo, nangona kunjalo.
Do not eat your food.	Musa ukutya ukutya kwakho.
That, however, is not possible.	Oko, nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka.
Maybe that will settle down.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuhlala phantsi.
I can't say who.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngubani.
I may have done something wrong then.	Inokuba ndenza into engalunganga ngoko.
Outside, that.	Ngaphandle, oko.
Well, that's not a problem at all.	Ewe, oko akukho ngxaki kwaphela.
He's back there again.	Uye wabuyela apho kwakhona.
I wanted him to come to me now.	Bendifuna eze kum ngoku.
I thought, well, what would it be.	Ndacinga, kulungile, kuya kuba yintoni.
How did this happen.	Yenzeke njani le nto.
I want to get home for lunch.	Ndifuna ukufika ekhaya ngesidlo sasemini.
Home at last.	Ekhaya ekugqibeleni.
Slightly inside.	Kancinci ngaphakathi.
He likes to make a lot of money.	Uthanda ukwenza imali kakhulu.
You may have already done so.	Usenokuba sele uyenzile.
To be better, by the way.	Ukuba ngcono, ngendlela.
Well a lot of the time though.	Kulungile ixesha elininzi kunjalo.
Then tell me your story.	Ndixelele ke ibali lakho.
It would be easy.	Bekuya kuba lula.
But for now it seems to us.	Kodwa okwangoku kubonakala ngathi .
Now, you know that.	Ngoku, uyayazi loo nto.
This time you will be here until breakfast.	Ngeli xesha uzakuba lapha kude kube isidlo sakusasa.
And this is exactly what it is.	Kwaye yiloo nto kanye le.
I never thought why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kutheni.
And that's what's wrong.	Kwaye yiloo nto engalunganga.
You're sure of that.	Uqinisekile ngaloo nto.
Here it is.	Yiyo le.
You what? 	Wena ntoni?
He would take it.	Wayeza kuthatha.
If someone will be me.	Ukuba umntu uya kuba ndim.
But not too much and.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu kwaye.
So he thought.	Ngoko wacinga.
That happens everywhere.	Oko kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba.
And it is very necessary.	Kwaye kufuneka kakhulu.
Then she told him the truth.	Emva koko wamxelela inyaniso.
And soon you will not be.	Kwaye kungekudala awuyi kuba.
For they say.	Kuba bathi.
Or maybe at the beginning.	Okanye mhlawumbi ekuqaleni.
And he does not want to.	Kwaye akafuni.
How to get this.	Ukufumana njani oku.
I need someone there.	Ndifuna umntu apho.
He didn’t go far, though.	Akazange aye kude, nangona kunjalo.
But, yes, there is something.	Kodwa, ewe, kukho into.
Isn't that right?	Ngaba akunjalo ewe.
But there is something you need to know, something about me.	Kodwa kukho into ekufuneka uyazi, into ethile ngam.
He decided that it was better to agree.	Wabona kungcono avume.
But this will be just you and me.	Kodwa oku kuya kuba ndim nawe kuphela.
I want to learn how to do it.	Ndifuna ukufunda ukwenza kwam.
He is not always there.	Akakho ngalo lonke ixesha.
He talked a lot to me.	Wathetha kakhulu nam.
I'll see you this afternoon.	Ndiza kubona ngale njikalanga.
That, it seems, is good.	Oko, kubonakala ukuba, ulungile.
And it should also work.	Kwaye kufuneka kwakhona ukusebenza.
If not tomorrow.	Ukuba akukho ngomso.
Thank you again very much.	Enkosi kwakhona kakhulu.
He wanted to eat first.	Wayefuna ukutya kuqala.
Not just a small mistake.	Hayi nje impazamo encinci.
Don't think that way.	Musa ukucinga ngolo hlobo.
We all deserve it.	Sonke sifanele.
To be sure, it happened many times.	Ukuthetha inyaniso, kwenzeka izihlandlo ezininzi.
All my children go to school.	Bonke abantwana bam baya esikolweni.
Not now, not us.	Hayi ngoku, hayi kuthi.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale phantsi ixesha elide.
I think you always read hard.	Ndicinga ukuba uhlala ufunda nzima.
Sorry for the party.	Hayi uxolo ngokwenza itheko.
We really want kids.	Sifuna abantwana ngokwenene.
It seems that this might be a bit strange.	Kubonakala ngathi le inokuba yinto engaqhelekanga ngakumbi.
Yes, it means yes, no it means no.	Ewe, kuthetha ewe, hayi kuthetha hayi.
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either.	Ewe kulungile ndixelele enye.
Yes, he is really scared.	Ewe, ngokwenene uyoyika.
He took his time and went back to the bedroom.	Wathatha ixesha lakhe wabuyela egumbini lokulala.
You never told me about it.	Awuzange undixelele ngayo.
But the work did not go well.	Kodwa umsebenzi awuzange uhambe kakuhle.
There is another better way.	Kukho enye indlela engcono kakhulu.
But, I don't know where the real problem is.	Kodwa, andazi apho ingxaki ngokwenene.
He walked into the room.	Wahamba waya egumbini.
Yes, if you want to.	Ewe, ukuba ufuna njalo.
That happened in the end.	Oko kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
She wants him to tell her that he loves her.	Ufuna amxelele ukuba uyamthanda.
But no one ever heard of him.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakha weva ngaye.
I thought about him all day.	Ndandicinga ngaye imini yonke.
You eat lunch every day.	Utya isidlo sasemini yonke imihla.
And so it is every day.	Kwaye kunjalo yonke imihla.
But he will return tomorrow.	Kodwa uya kubuya ngomso.
Not about everything.	Hayi malunga nayo yonke into.
I can do it all day.	Ndingayenza imini yonke.
You have to wait until later.	Kufuneka ulinde kude kube kamva.
So you need to talk to him about it.	Ngoko kuya kufuneka uthethe naye ngaloo nto.
I thought better of you.	Bendicinga ngcono ngawe.
Happy is the man.	Uyavuya umntu.
Because she is so beautiful.	Ngokuba mhle kakhulu.
I have to go.	Kufuneka ndiye.
I don't want to be you.	Andifuni ukuba nguwe.
He stayed, too.	Wahlala, naye.
This is not as easy as it seems.	Oku akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
I hope all is well.	Ndiyathemba konke kulungile.
Your answer is correct.	Impendulo yakho ilungile.
Everything is fine there for sure.	Yonke into ilungile apho ngokuqinisekileyo.
Whatever that means for you.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni oko kuwe.
The way you did it to me.	Indlela owenze ngayo kum.
I had to hear my voice again.	Kwafuneka ndiphinde ndive ilizwi lam.
He stayed inside her for a long time.	Wahlala ngaphakathi kwakhe ixesha elide.
He can't work.	Akakwazi ukusebenza.
But he stands for something.	Kodwa umele into.
You have to be there.	Ufanele ukuba lapho.
He doesn't know this.	Akayazi le nto.
He really thought he did.	Ngokwenene wayecinga ukuba uyenzile.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba mandiyenze njani le nto.
No, no, not alone.	Hayi, hayi, hayi yedwa.
And so it had to be.	Kwaye ke kwafuneka ukuba.
He looks at his living space.	Ujonge indawo yakhe yokuhlala.
It would be the same at home.	Bekuya kuba njalo ekhaya.
Maybe alcohol.	Mhlawumbi utywala.
Although you have to do a little bit.	Nangona kufuneka wenze kancinci.
But you can't stay here.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala apha.
Eyes, maybe.	Amehlo, mhlawumbi.
What to do, he did not know.	Ukwenza ntoni, wayengazi.
Maybe you did it quickly.	Mhlawumbi uyenzile ngokukhawuleza.
How difficult can it be ?.	Inokuba nzima kangakanani?.
But it.	Kodwa yona.
He is looking at the house.	Ujonge indlu.
That is our only hope.	Lithemba lethu elinye elo.
Going there alone was not necessary.	Ukuya apho ndedwa kwakungeyomfuneko.
Obviously, that will not be easy.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akuyi kuba lula.
I have done some but.	Ndenze ezinye kodwa.
And again not so much.	Kwaye kwakhona hayi kakhulu.
Not today and probably not.	Hayi namhlanje kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He continued all night.	Waqhubeka ubusuku bonke.
But not everyone wants that.	Kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu ofuna oko.
Not where I want to.	Hayi apho ndifuna khona.
That was clearly evident.	Oko kwakubonakala ngokucacileyo.
Only what.	Kuphela yintoni.
Immediately it will be fine.	Ngoko nangoko kuya kuba kuhle.
He just wanted to be better.	Wayefuna nje ukuba ngcono.
Maybe he told me.	Mhlawumbi wandixelela.
I like my place.	Ndiyayithanda indawo yam.
I do not understand anything.	Andiqondi nto.
He would not go.	Wayengayi .
If only, if only.	Ukuba kuphela, ukuba kuphela.
I don't want to talk too much about him.	Andifuni kuthetha kakhulu ngaye.
I wanted a party.	Bendifuna itheko.
And if you are lucky.	Kwaye ukuba unethamsanqa.
He told me in front of him.	Wandixelela phambi kwakhe.
No, don't think that way.	Hayi, musa ukucinga ngolo hlobo.
Your children will do it.	Abantwana bakho baya kuyenza.
We will make it happen.	Siza kuyenza yenzeke.
Finding his way.	Ukufumana indlela yakhe.
Thinking is good.	Ukucinga kulungile.
Something happened to him here.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye apha.
He continued the music.	Waqhubeka umculo.
Don't forget to get help.	Ungalibali ukufumana uncedo.
Maybe you should have it.	Mhlawumbi ufanele ube nayo.
I look at you.	ndijonge wena.
We will not do anything big with anything.	Asiyi kwenza nto enkulu ngayo nantoni na.
That is all.	Yiyo yonke.
But he didn't, and he never was.	Kodwa akazange, kwaye akazange.
Please tell her she can't do this.	Nceda umxelele ukuba akanakuyenza le nto.
I can't do anything, not really.	Andikwazi ukwenza nantoni na, hayi ngokwenene.
You better stay here.	Kungcono uhlale apha.
And yes, you read that right.	Kwaye ewe, ufunda oko kulungile.
Yes, this will happen.	Ewe, oku kuya kwenzeka.
The question can be anything.	Umbuzo unokuba nantoni na.
I just forgot.	Ndilibele nje.
You eat meat.	Utya inyama.
I don't think they'll do anything about it.	Andiqondi ukuba baya kwenza nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Dinner at the venue.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa kwindawo.
In this case, he wanted a job, immediately.	Kule meko, wayefuna umsebenzi, ngokukhawuleza.
We'll be gone, and soon.	Siza kuhamba, kwaye kungekudala.
If they are some then others.	Ukuba ngaba abanye ngoko abanye.
They say no one.	Bathi akukho namnye.
Not everyone will do it.	Ayinguye wonke umntu oza kuyenza.
Maybe they will succeed in this.	Mhlawumbi baya kuphumelela kule nto.
It's all about you.	Konke malunga nawe.
Soon he would be off work.	Kungekudala wayeza kuba engekho emsebenzini.
Stop having children.	Yeka ukuba nabantwana.
Man could never do things again.	Umntu akazange akwazi ukwenza izinto kwakhona.
If you are absolutely sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile ngokupheleleyo.
That was no longer necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko ngakumbi.
It could be you.	Usenokuba nguwe.
You will be there one day, but for now.	Uza kuba lapho ngenye imini, kodwa okwangoku.
I didn't see much.	Khange ndibone okuninzi.
We know it's hard to do.	Siyazi ukuba kunzima ukwenza.
However, he was nowhere to be found.	Nangona kunjalo, wayengekho ndawo.
I have to talk to her before she goes home.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye phambi kokuba agoduke.
Please do it, only you.	Nceda uyenze, nguwe kuphela.
But he stayed with us.	Kodwa wahlala kunye nathi.
I want to play something else now.	Ndifuna ukudlala enye into ngoku.
Not just immediately.	Hayi nje ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want anything right now.	Andifuni nto ngoku.
He can see people.	Uyakwazi ukubona abantu.
I could not find a way to do this.	Andikwazanga ukufumana indlela yokwenza oku.
My life for him.	Ubomi bam ngenxa yakhe.
And we know he's not here.	Kwaye siyazi ukuba akakho apha.
That is also true.	Kwakhona yinyani leyo.
But it doesn't have to be this way.	Kodwa akufuneki kube ngale ndlela.
If not for me, then man.	Ukuba akukho kum, ngoko umntu.
What could be the problem with it?	Inokuba yintoni ingxaki ngayo.
He always makes it very easy.	Uhlala ekwenza kube lula kakhulu.
You will win one person at a time.	Uya kuphumelela umntu omnye ngexesha.
It's too long and.	Mde kakhulu kwaye.
She tried to be nice to him.	Wazama ukuba mhle kuye.
I do a little bit of everything.	Ndenza kancinci kuyo yonke into.
She did not know exactly how she felt.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uziva njani.
He would go alone and eat with friends.	Wayeza kuhamba yedwa kwaye atye nabahlobo.
Being here.	Ukuba lapha.
There is no passage of time.	Akukho kuhamba kwexesha.
Something unusual is needed.	Kufuneka into engaqhelekanga.
Or maybe some.	Okanye mhlawumbi ezinye.
And there were no hours.	Kwaye kwakungekho iiyure.
I have to go upstairs to the hospital.	Kufuneka ndiye phezulu esibhedlele.
We all need to do that.	Sonke kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
By that time he was very drunk.	Ngelo xesha wayesele kakhulu.
You have to tell him where he came from.	Kufuneka umxelele ukuba eze phi.
No one knew there was anything wrong with that then.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngaloo nto ngoko.
Times there.	Amaxesha apho.
So the story.	Ngoko ibali.
First person.	Umntu wokuqala.
To me, it never happened.	Kum, akuzange kwenzeke.
However, you may be better off.	Nokuba kunjalo, usenokuba ngcono.
If you think enough, it will become a reality.	Ukuba ucinga ngokwaneleyo, iya kuba yinyani.
You must have come that way.	Umele ukuba uze ngolo hlobo.
Without you, no problem.	Ngaphandle kwakho, akukho ngxaki.
I can think straight enough.	Ndiyakwazi ukucinga kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
You are very much.	Nguwe kakhulu.
Call, if you like.	Umnxeba, ukuba uyathanda.
But he is not going to you.	Kodwa akayi kuwe.
But this is even more difficult.	Kodwa oku kunzima ngakumbi.
Dad did it.	Utata uyenzile.
And you have that.	Kwaye unayo loo nto.
Someone lived in this.	Umntu wayehlala kule.
This is not required of you.	Oku akufuneki kuwe.
She never spoke of him again.	Zange aphinde athethe ngaye.
That seems to me very clear.	Oko kubonakala kum kucacile.
Making sense.	Ukwenza ingqondo.
But at that time, it was not easy.	Kodwa ngelo xesha, akuzange kube lula.
We don't have to be here at all.	Akufunekanga sibe lapha tu.
Finally he looked up.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga.
Finally, the wait was over.	Ekugqibeleni, ukulinda kwaphela.
How does one do this?	Umntu uyenza njani lento.
It will be more visible.	Kuya kubonakala ngakumbi.
But he is a good child.	Kodwa ngumntwana olungileyo.
He lives on time.	Uhlala ngexesha.
But something terrible happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
Now you have to think about that going backwards.	Ngoku kufuneka ucinge ngaloo nto ukuya ngasemva.
Unless he went nowhere, of course.	Ngaphandle kokuba akazange aye ndawo, kunjalo.
And you want to sing.	Kwaye ufuna ukucula.
That's it or the bus.	Yiloo nto okanye ibhasi.
I'll tell her soon.	Ndiza kumxelela kungekudala.
Almost, but no.	Phantse, kodwa hayi.
And he never made it with money, either.	Kwaye akazange ayenze ngemali, nayo.
He wanted peace.	Wayefuna uxolo.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube ngolu hlobo.
You think this.	Ucinga le nto.
I'm sorry about that.	Ndicela uxolo ngalonto .
Or if you did, which one.	Okanye ukuba uyenzile, yeyiphi.
That will really do it.	Oko kuya kuyenza ngenene.
He got into my car.	Wangena emotweni yam.
Not all but.	Hayi yonke kodwa.
Didn't you know.	Ngaba awuzange uyazi.
Many years to you.	Iminyaka emininzi kuwe.
It's just not there.	Akukho nje apho.
She was not beautiful at all.	Wayengekho mhle kwaphela.
Watch music together.	Jonga umculo kunye.
And it will not be fun.	Kwaye akuyi kuba mnandi.
I did not want to see it again.	Ndandingafuni ukubona kwakhona.
It will be your job.	Iya kuba ngumsebenzi wakho.
You have your way.	Unayo indlela yakho.
What he was going to do, he didn't know.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni, wayengazi.
Everyone else lives with you.	Bonke abanye bahlala nawe.
However, you do not want to wait too long.	Nangona kunjalo, awufuni ukulinda ixesha elide.
There is something you need to do.	Kukho into ekufuneka uyenzile.
I wanted to come here.	Bendifuna ukuza apha.
Certainly this is the case in this case.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo kule meko.
He started reading.	Waqalisa ukufunda.
Maybe there is a better way.	Mhlawumbi kukho indlela engcono.
Then he said something.	Emva koko wathetha into.
We'll see how you go.	Siza kubona ukuba uhamba njani.
What we all know is not so.	Oko sonke siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
No, there is no time.	Hayi, akukho xesha.
There seemed to be a place.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kukho indawo.
We have never had it before.	Asizange sibe nayo ngaphambili.
He is right there.	Nguye kanye apho.
Not that you won’t be.	Akunjalo ukuba awuyi kuba.
And no one will say anything.	Kwaye akukho mntu uya kuthetha nto.
I never spoke to him again.	Khange ndiphinde ndithethe naye.
But he is sitting alone.	Kodwa uhleli yedwa.
I want to get away from this.	Ndifuna kude kule.
And that will be.	Kwaye oko kuya kuba .
You learn to buy better.	Ufunda ukuthenga ngcono.
I hope you know more than I do.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ngaphezu kwam.
He has continued with it.	Uye waqhubeka nayo.
Hard time.	Ixesha lokuba nzima.
Or just fine.	Okanye nje kakuhle.
You know, not always.	Uyazi, hayi rhoqo.
But not everywhere.	Kodwa hayi kuyo yonke indawo.
No one really knows why.	Akukho mntu wazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
You will need to look at where your money is.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge ukuba iphi imali yakho.
And they will be, you know.	Kwaye baya kuba, uyazi.
I don't need to say more than that.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndithethe ngaphezu koko.
He did this as often as possible.	Wakwenza oku rhoqo kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
You knew then.	Ubusazi ngoko.
Now he did not know.	Ngoku wayengazi.
Please come if you want to learn something new.	Nceda uze ukuba ufuna ukufunda into entsha.
It’s not fun and it’s not fun.	Akukho mnandi kwaye akukho mnandi.
One day he will be gone.	Ngenye imini uya kube engekho.
Why is that ?.	Kutheni kunjalo nje?.
At that moment, she realized.	Ngelo xesha, waqonda.
But not so much one.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu enye.
You need to tell her to leave right away.	Kufuneka umxelele ukuba ahambe ngoko nangoko.
He learned about it.	Wafunda ngayo.
I know nothing at all.	Andazi nto kwaphela.
We do not have to.	Nathi akufuneki.
But this is okay !!.	Kodwa oku kulungile !!.
He would say something.	Wayeza kuthetha into.
Is there anything more about that to know?	Ngaba kukho ngakumbi malunga naloo nto ukwazi?
At home, he thought.	Ekhaya, wacinga.
In the end, it is good to tell the truth.	Ekugqibeleni, kuhle ukuthetha inyaniso.
I don't want either.	Nam andifuni.
I don't know why or how you do this.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okanye uyenza njani le nto.
To me, it is almost unnecessary.	Kum, phantse akuyomfuneko.
He did very well with her.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu naye.
But it will be very difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
I may have thought a lot though.	Inokuba ndicinge kakhulu kodwa.
He said he had to learn something new every day.	Wathi kufuneka afunde into entsha yonke imihla.
He never talked to me.	Zange athethe ngayo nam.
I want something like this.	Ndifuna into enje.
It takes us all.	Kuthatha kuthi sonke.
You will find a way.	Uya kufumana indlela.
I don't want to take anything from him.	Andifuni kuthatha nto kuye.
We will leave in a few hours.	Siza kuhamba iiyure ezimbalwa.
If you did very well.	Ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Too many hours.	Iiyure ezininzi kakhulu.
Now she plans more.	Ngoku uceba ngakumbi.
Very good when you think about it.	Kuhle kakhulu xa ucinga ngayo.
That would be so.	Oko bekuya kuba njalo.
Looks like that would be a lot easier.	Kubonakala ngathi oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
He is lying there.	Ulele phantsi apho.
You do not know what is going on.	Awuyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Making it difficult.	Ukwenza kunzima.
And that happened to us.	Kwaye kwenzeka loo nto kuthi.
And thinking.	Kwaye ukucinga.
We'll see what it is.	Siza kubona ukuba yintoni na.
Is that difficult.	Ngaba oko kunzima.
To do so, we need your help.	Ukwenza oko, sifuna uncedo lwakho.
It was never the other way around.	Akuzange kube ngenye indlela.
I don't care which one.	Andikhathali nokuba yeyiphi.
To do this too much.	Ukwenza oku kakhulu.
Do not take it too often.	Musa ukuthatha njalo.
I could not decide who he was.	Andizange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba ngubani.
I'm tired, please.	Ndidiniwe, nceda.
But you have to be sad now.	Kodwa kufuneka ube buhlungu ngoku.
And so he left without one.	Kwaye ngoko wemka ngaphandle komnye.
And that's fine, but it's just fine.	Kwaye oko kulungile, kodwa kulungile kuphela.
I doubt it will be.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba iya kuba njalo.
I know nothing about him before.	Andazi kwanto ngaye ngaphambili.
She loves dinner.	Uyayithanda isidlo sangokuhlwa.
To be together.	Ukuba sibe kunye.
Going out to eat together, and so on.	Ukuhamba kunye ukuya kutya kunye, njalo njalo.
Now he went on.	Ngoku waqhubeka.
So, rather than three.	Ngoko ke, kunokuba ezintathu.
He did not know how long he had been there.	Wayengazi ukuba wahlala ixesha elingakanani apho.
in the morning.	ekuseni.
He looked at the small area in the back.	Wajonga indawo encinci ngasemva.
Eating breakfast together.	Ukutya isidlo sakusasa kunye.
Everything becomes difficult.	Konke kuba nzima.
It's just that it's so hard, you know.	Kuphela nje ukuba kunzima kakhulu, uyazi.
In a good way, yes.	Ngendlela entle, ewe.
He will be too old for her soon.	Uzakuba mdala kakhulu kuye kungekudala.
I think he didn't want to go.	Ndicinga ukuba wayengafuni ukuhamba.
You love your phone.	Uyayithanda ifowuni yakho.
If not really.	Ukuba akunjalo ngokwenene.
And he didn't want to go.	Kwaye wayengafuni ukuya.
But do not make such a decision.	Kodwa musa ukwenza isigqibo ngolo hlobo.
But then, it might be best.	Kodwa emva koko, inokuba yinto engcono kakhulu.
However, that is not the case at all.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo kwaphela.
You, something.	Wena, into.
I love your place, though.	Ndiyayithanda indawo yakho, nangona kunjalo.
No, something else is happening here.	Hayi, kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
It happens all the time, though.	Kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha, nangona kunjalo.
She looks scared.	Ubonakala ukuba uyoyika.
You may feel the same way.	Usenokuba uziva ngendlela efanayo.
Probably never.	Mhlawumbi soze.
Yes, he would be there.	Ewe, wayeza kuba lapho.
No one.	Akakho mntu.
Nobody wants to go through all that, no more.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhamba kuyo yonke loo nto, hayi kwakhona.
I'll talk to you.	Ndiya kuthetha nawe.
She wanted to go to him.	Wayefuna ukuya kuye.
He asked me to wait.	Wandicela ukuba ndilinde.
He did not try to help.	Akazange azame ukunceda.
All day in the office.	Imini yonke eofisini.
And this has actually happened.	Kwaye oku kuye kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Looks like no one is interested here.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho mntu unomdla apha.
One way, then another.	Enye indlela, emva koko enye.
I hope you did not wait too long.	Ndiyathemba ukuba awuzange ulinde ixesha elide.
He wanted something better.	Wayefuna into engcono.
I really didn't.	Ngenene andizange.
Who to talk to, who to tell.	Umntu oza kuthetha naye, ngubani oza kumxelela.
I'm glad you're interested.	Ndiyavuya unomdla.
He wants to help people.	Ufuna ukunceda abantu.
But my mother just wants to be there.	Kodwa umama ufuna nje ukuba lapho.
I only went for one.	Ndaya enye kuphela.
We know a little, a little too much.	Siyazi kancinci, kancinci kakhulu.
But it's okay for me.	Kodwa kulungile kum.
And soon on that.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza kuloo nto.
You don’t have to stay and you shouldn’t be here.	Akufunekanga uhlale kwaye akufanele ube lapha.
But this can take a long time.	Kodwa oku kuthatha ixesha elide.
I'll take anything.	Ndiza kuthatha nantoni na.
He knew he had done something wrong.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into engalunganga ayenzileyo.
And there is nothing behind it.	Kwaye akukho nto emva.
I know you don't want to talk to me.	Ndiyayazi awufuni kuthetha nam.
Just another job.	Omnye umsebenzi nje.
It should be soon.	Kufuneka kube kungekudala.
Maybe there's something else there.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye into apho.
He would come to her.	Wayeza kuye.
Besides, we did everything.	Ngaphandle koko, senze konke.
You just don't want this to happen.	Awufuni nje ukuba kwenzeke oku.
Then he started singing.	Emva koko waqalisa ukucula.
He said he would find a nice place.	Wathi uya kufumana indawo entle.
I decided right away.	Ndagqiba ngoko nangoko.
If you love him.	Ukuba uyamthanda.
He is looking here to stay.	Ujonge apha ukuba ahlale.
That is a bad thing.	Yinto embi ke leyo.
But he did not stay there.	Kodwa akazange ahlale apho.
There was no question at all about that.	Kwakungekho mbuzo konke konke ngaloo nto.
And this one.	Kwaye lo .
You will get better in the end.	Uya kuba ngcono ekugqibeleni.
There was nothing about him.	Kwakungekho nto ngaye.
And if you can't then fine.	Kwaye ukuba awukwazi kulungile.
So man cannot.	Ngoko umntu akanakukwazi.
I had no idea it could be that easy.	Ndandingazi ukuba inokuba lula ngolo hlobo.
Later, he says.	Kamva, uthi.
That is our truth.	Yinyani yethu leyo.
Maybe he wasn't the only one.	Mhlawumbi yayingenguye yedwa.
Well, obviously not.	Ewe, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
A lot of time really.	Ixesha elininzi ngokwenene.
He did not want alcohol.	Wayengafuni utywala.
Are you willing to take that opportunity ?.	Ngaba uzimisele ukuba ithuba?.
We had to go to the office.	Kwafuneka siye eofisini.
You talk to him for two hours.	Uthetha naye iiyure ezimbini.
One day, he was gone.	Ngenye imini, wayengekho.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi le.
I mean I read a lot.	Ndithetha ukuba ndifunde kakhulu.
Down to the top.	Phantsi ukuya phezulu.
And so do you.	Kwaye ngoko nawe.
Some more.	Abanye ngakumbi.
Almost entirely, of course.	Phantse ngokupheleleyo, kunjalo.
He knew there was no future for this.	Wayesazi ukuba akukho kamva kule nto.
I told you all about it.	Ndikuxelele konke ngayo.
No one is talking, then.	Akukho mntu uthetha, ngoko.
I think this is impossible and impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka kwaye akunakwenzeka.
And this can be a bit wrong.	Kwaye oku kunokuba yinto engalunganga kangako.
I don't remember any.	Andikhumbuli nokuba yeyiphi.
You go if you want to.	Uhamba ukuba ufuna.
We want everyone to succeed.	Sifuna wonke umntu aphumelele.
We will be able to talk later.	Siza kukwazi ukuthetha kamva.
Or last week, for that matter.	Okanye kwiveki ephelileyo, ngaloo nto.
I think everyone knows now.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyazi ngoku.
And not in this place.	Kwaye hayi kule ndawo.
Right here in his place.	Kanye apha kwindawo yakhe.
Nowhere, not here.	Akukho ndawo, hayi apha.
So, it happened this way.	Ngoko, kwenzeka ngolu hlobo.
I just want to do my job.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
But being sad is hard.	Kodwa ukuba buhlungu kunzima.
I will always go.	Ndiza kuhamba rhoqo.
This should happen yesterday.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke izolo.
Well, not myself.	Ewe, hayi ngokwam.
He knew nothing about that place.	Wayengazi nto ngaloo ndawo.
The message will be simple.	Umyalezo uya kuba lula.
That's what happened to it.	Nantso into eyenzekayo kuyo.
Not to eat.	Hayi ukuba atye.
You probably know that too.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ukuba kakhulu.
He thinks it's okay.	Ucinga ukuba kulungile.
My work and my children are good.	Mhle umsebenzi wam kunye nabantwana bam.
I thought you knew it.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi.
They will come later.	Baza kuza kamva.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, akafane .
That way you will see.	Ngaloo ndlela uya kubona.
I have never seen him before today.	Andizange ndimbone ngaphambili namhlanje.
He told her he wanted to stay with her again.	Wamxelela ukuba ufuna ukuhlala naye kwakhona.
And you'll be fine, of course.	Kwaye uya kuba ulungile, kunjalo.
This can be a thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto.
One mind is right.	Ingqondo enye ilungile.
Because that makes it so much better.	Kuba oko kwenza ukuba kube ngcono kakhulu.
I can do it this way.	Ndingayenza ngale ndlela.
Tomorrow is clear.	Kusasa kucacile.
Attention is everything he wants.	Ingqalelo yiyo yonke into ayifunayo.
I wish you peace.	Ndinqwenela uxolo.
Old house.	Indlu endala.
You know you did something wrong.	Uyazi ukuba wenze into engalunganga.
Please and thank you !.	Nceda kwaye enkosi!.
So at dinner.	Ngoko kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
That takes up a lot of space.	Oko kuthatha indawo eninzi.
Now, he said, he understood.	Ngoku, wathi, waqonda.
He just made it true.	Wenza nje ukuba yinyani.
Anything can be a very good thing.	Nantoni na inokuba yinto entle kakhulu.
He easily got into it.	Wangena lula kuyo .
But you can't do everything.	Kodwa awukwazi ukwenza yonke into.
It's the same thing last night.	Yinto enye phezolo.
He ran away anyway.	Wabaleka kunjalo.
He said he would not go far.	Wathi akayi kude.
Swimming alone.	Ukuqubha ndedwa.
Location and time.	Indawo kunye nexesha.
The doctor was nowhere to be seen.	Ugqirha wayengabonakali ndawo.
Don't go now.	Musa ukuya okwangoku.
I want to do this, really.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku, ngenene.
He will return to live again.	Uya kubuya ukuhlala kwakhona.
Look at the bike.	Jonga ibhayisekile.
You can be very angry.	Unokuba nomsindo kakhulu.
I would love an opportunity to do that.	Ndingathanda ithuba lokwenza oko.
No, no play.	Hayi, hayi ukudlala.
I like it and he doesn’t like it.	Ndiyayithanda kwaye akayithandi.
It's hard to die.	Kunzima ukufa.
I'll be back late.	Ndiza kubuya late.
He must be.	Kufuneka abe .
That's what you feel.	Yiloo nto uziva ngayo.
Man is like that and he loves it.	Umntu unjalo kwaye uyayithanda.
And you know what it is.	Kwaye uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Mom will be my only doctor.	UMama uya kuba ngugqirha wam kuphela.
He wanted to do that.	Wayefuna ukwenza njalo.
You just know that.	Uyayazi nje loo nto.
I made a party.	Ndenze itheko.
He gave me one, and he took another.	Wandinika enye, wathatha enye.
I thought he was good to me.	Ndandicinga ukuba ulungile kum.
He will stay with us for a few days.	Uza kuhlala nathi iintsuku ezimbalwa.
No one expects it to be so.	Akukho mntu ulindele ukuba kube njalo.
This is not so easy though.	Oku akukho lula kangako nangona kunjalo.
All of this will end one day.	Konke oku kuya kuphela ngenye imini.
Living there, many say, is even harder.	Ukuhlala apho, abaninzi bathi, kunzima ngakumbi.
Now bad.	Ngoku embi.
But my mother did a good job.	Kodwa umama wenza umsebenzi omhle.
You probably knew better.	Usenokuba ubusazi ngcono.
To say something.	Ukuthetha into.
Anything, everything, nothing.	Nantoni na, yonke into, akukho nto.
You do not have to do anything about it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba wenze nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Let me tell you how.	Makhe ndikuxelele ukuba njani.
Here, though.	Apha, nangona .
I happened to arrive.	kwenzeka ukuba ndifike.
And he went to do something about it.	Waza waya kwenza into ngaloo nto.
Only to be beautiful.	Ukuba mhle kuphela.
He never did such a thing.	Zange enze into enje.
Now there is plenty of room for both of us.	Ngoku kukho indawo eninzi yethu sobabini.
I do not know what will happen to us.	Andazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni kuthi.
I deserve to be him.	Ndifanele ukuba nguye.
What everyone knows.	Oko wonke umntu uyazi.
Now he finally did.	Ngoku ekugqibeleni wenza.
All because of us.	Konke ngenxa yethu.
He would be back soon.	Wayeza kubuya kungekudala.
He told me what it was.	Wandixelela ukuba yintoni na.
So many .	Ezininzi kakhulu .
But this is it, though.	Kodwa yile nto, nangona kunjalo.
Also, your job is better.	Kwakhona, umsebenzi wakho ungcono.
So stop trying to do everything.	Ngoko ke yeka ukuzama ukwenza konke.
Maybe he knew, he thought.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi, wacinga njalo.
But it's not about that.	Kodwa akukho malunga naloo nto.
So you learn in the wrong place.	Ngoko ufunda kwindawo engalunganga.
I look forward to playing this one.	Ndijonge phambili ukudlala le.
I want to see what happens.	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Quickly at first.	Ngokukhawuleza ekuqaleni.
He said, that is not the case.	Wathi, ayisiyiyo loo nto.
Well, well, he said.	Ewe, kulungile, wathi.
I did, yes.	Ndiyenzile, ewe.
We will go to him together.	Siza kuya kuye kunye.
Maybe that would be good enough.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba kuhle ngokwaneleyo.
I'm also tired of this.	Nam ndidiniwe yile nto.
I want you to do this.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze oku.
And then, there it is.	Kwaye ke, nantso.
He certainly did not know that you could do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengazi ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
So good.	Ngoko kuhle.
One more thing, then.	Enye into, ngoko.
Everyone, people.	Wonke umntu, abantu.
Not just tonight.	Hayi nje ngokuhlwanje.
Help me with that.	Ndincede ngalonto.
And well, you know.	Kwaye kulungile, uyazi.
Nobody stayed there for long.	Kwakungekho mntu wahlala apho ixesha elide.
You will only get one.	Uya kufumana enye kuphela.
I wanted to do it once.	Ndandifuna ukuyenza kube kanye.
You need to do the right thing now.	Kufuneka wenze into elungileyo ngoku.
I want to buy a car right away.	Ndifuna ukuthenga imoto ngokukhawuleza.
That's what it's going to do.	Nantso into eza kuyenza.
Everyone wanted to succeed.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuphumelela.
So, not death.	Ngoko, hayi ukufa.
Something that no one else did.	Into engazange yenziwe mntu.
You are right on time.	Ulungile ngexesha.
He lives now.	Uhlala ngoku.
Immediately.	Kwangoko nangoko.
There is so much out there.	Kukho okuninzi phaya.
I look forward to meeting you soon.	Ndijonge ukudibana nawe kungekudala.
I thought you should know everything.	Bendicinga ukuba ufanele ukwazi yonke into.
The one you are talking to.	Lowo uthetha naye.
Here we will find the same thing.	Apha siza kufumana into efanayo.
Soon, no later.	Kungekudala, akukho kamva.
Yes, that's the problem.	Ewe, loo ngxaki.
You've done the right thing, to come forward.	Wenze into elungileyo, ukuza ngaphambili.
He thought it was his job to stay.	Wayecinga ukuba ngumsebenzi wakhe ukuhlala.
Maybe now we know why.	Mhlawumbi ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
It's not fun, so everything today.	Akukho mnandi, ukuze yonke into namhlanje.
He wants time alone.	Ufuna ixesha eyedwa.
Looked up .	Wajonga phezulu .
It's your thing.	Yinto yakho.
Just look at the restaurant.	Jonga nje indawo yokutyela.
Please check these locations.	Nceda ujonge ezi ndawo.
Next month too.	Kwinyanga ezayo kakhulu.
He just works all day.	Usebenza nje imini yonke.
I thought like you too.	Nam bendicinga njengawe.
We are going to dinner.	Siya kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
Today is fine.	Namhlanje kulungile.
There is no place for me here.	Akukho ndawo yam apha.
As it should be, probably.	Njengoko bekufanele ukuba, mhlawumbi.
Also, it is more difficult.	Kwakhona, kunzima ngakumbi.
And you want more time.	Kwaye ufuna ixesha elingakumbi.
It can also be really beautiful.	Kwakhona kunokuba mhle ngokwenene.
Maybe it will be something new.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba yinto entsha.
So, what.	Ngoko ke, yintoni na.
Then he took some from his car.	Emva koko wathatha abanye emotweni yakhe.
And he died, alone.	Kwaye wafa, yedwa.
So with all that.	Ngoko nayo yonke loo nto.
I knew now.	Ndandisazi ngoku.
That, however, is happening slowly.	Oko, nangona kunjalo, kwenzeka kancinci kancinci.
One day, he told me that he was not there.	Ngenye imini, wandixelela ukuba wayengekho.
It happens very fast.	Kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I think all of this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba konke oku kulungile.
You obviously know that.	Ngokucacileyo uyayazi loo nto.
He walked down.	Wahamba phantsi.
I thought you, well, would like to know.	Ndicinge, ke, ungathanda ukwazi.
I had to do this alone.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze ndedwa le nto.
Just a little bit, now and then.	Kancinci nje, ngoku kwaye ngoko.
I did not know who or how much.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ngubani okanye malini.
He never did anything like that.	Akazange enze nto ngolo hlobo.
Thank you for all your work.	Enkosi ngomsebenzi wakho wonke.
And it has to happen all or nothing.	Kwaye kufuneka kwenzeke konke okanye akukho nto.
It will be one whole thing, or all the other.	Kuya kuba yinto enye yonke, okanye yonke enye.
I want to finish this.	Ndifuna ukugqiba oku.
Only and no one goes well with any one.	Kuphela kwaye akukho mntu uhamba kakuhle nayiphi na.
I heard something.	Ndeva into.
Something happened behind me.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo emva kwam.
You think you know better.	Ucinga ukuba uyazi ngcono.
He knew this was not the case.	Wayesazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
But anyone can do it in that situation.	Kodwa nabani na angayenza kuloo meko.
Our job is to make it hard for you.	Umsebenzi wethu kukwenza ukuba kube nzima kuwe.
Yes, it happened to me.	Ewe, kwenzeka kum.
I can't help any of that.	Andikwazi ukunceda nayiphi na loo nto.
Good performance for a long time.	Ukuqhuba kakuhle ixesha elide.
Certainly that is it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yiloo nto.
Exactly what you are going to do with it.	Kanye into oza kuyenza ngayo.
Just a party.	Itheko nje.
I want to go to a restaurant.	Ndifuna ukuya kwindawo yokutyela.
You feel like it should be easy.	Uziva ngathi kufuneka kube lula.
And so do many.	Kwaye kunjalo abaninzi.
He really does not know.	Ngokwenene akazi.
You told him you did it.	Umxelele ukuba uyenzile.
Give me a job.	Ndinike umsebenzi.
I think this happens all the time.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
This is for everyone.	Oku kuye wonke umntu.
I'll have to look into that.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge oko.
Food, space.	Ukutya, indawo.
Well thought out, whatever it is.	Ndicinge kakuhle, nokuba yintoni na.
Very much so.	Kakhulu ngokupheleleyo.
Not exactly.	Hayi ncam ncam.
I feel differently.	Ndiziva ngenye indlela.
I hope you did well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenze kakuhle.
He wasted his time.	Wachitha ixesha lakhe.
No, not really.	Hayi, hayi kakuhle.
I'm tired, I'm tired.	Ndidiniwe, ndidiniwe.
He needs to know everything that is going on.	Kufuneka azi yonke into eyenzekayo.
He should not have done that.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ayenze loo nto.
I want you to tell me some things.	Ndifuna undixelele ezinye izinto.
Don't think about your time.	Musa ukucinga ngexesha lakho.
They will be in pain.	Baya kuba buhlungu.
Yet he loves her.	Nangona kunjalo uyamthanda.
Everyone knows who will win.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba ngubani oza kuphumelela.
Not only today, but every day.	Hayi kuphela namhlanje, kodwa yonke imihla.
No one comes for years.	Akukho mntu uza iminyaka.
He would wait another two days.	Wayeza kulinda ezinye iintsuku ezimbini.
You know you're going to leave soon.	Uyazi ukuba uza kuhamba kungekudala.
You can do it, too.	Ungayenza, nawe.
He fell asleep immediately.	Walala ngokukhawuleza.
However, the money will start over.	Nangona kunjalo, imali iza kuqala.
You certainly know that by now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
I'll see if you're okay.	Ndiza kubona ukuba ulungile na.
Really thank you very much.	Ngenene enkosi kakhulu kuwe.
This time he got his name.	Ngeli xesha wafumana igama lakhe.
Just taking, taking.	Ukuthatha nje, ukuthatha.
I'm not sad about him.	Andikho buhlungu ngenxa yakhe.
Yes, and thank you.	Ewe, kwaye enkosi.
Or you may have heard of other things.	Okanye weva ezinye izinto.
That's one thing.	Leyo yinto enye.
Work works your way.	Umsebenzi wenza ngendlela yakho.
So, everything is fine here.	Ngoko, yonke into ilungile apha.
That's my thing.	Yinto yam ke leyo.
It was not so long ago.	Akuzange kube kudala kangako.
We want one clearly.	Sifuna enye ngokucacileyo.
Or his wife.	Okanye umfazi wakhe.
And that is very unlikely.	Kwaye oko akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
And the people inside.	Kwaye abantu ngaphakathi.
It’s hard to say though.	Kunzima ukuthetha nangona kunjalo.
You are really looking forward to it.	Ngenene ujonge phambili kuyo.
But then everyone.	Kodwa ke wonke umntu.
And many books.	Kwaye iincwadi ezininzi.
Not too long.	Hayi mde kakhulu.
And he lived with her.	Kwaye wayehlala naye.
But he asked me to do it.	Kodwa wandicela ukuba ndiyenze.
This can be easy, if not too hard, to do.	Oku kunokuba lula, ukuba akukho nzima kakhulu, ukwenza.
What are you wearing?.	Ingaba unxibe ntoni?.
We will try everything.	Siza kuzama yonke into.
We did nothing else.	Asizange senze enye into.
He thinks the truth.	Ucinga inyaniso.
He went into his bedroom.	Wangena kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
This will take a little longer.	Oku kuya kuthatha kancinci.
And my mom is better.	Kwaye umama wam ungcono.
You do more and you learn more.	Wenza ngakumbi ufunda ngakumbi.
Everyone is also interested.	Wonke umntu naye unomdla.
Anything here.	Nokuba yintoni na apha.
Absolutely in it.	Ngokupheleleyo kuyo.
He kept talking about it.	Waqhubeka ethetha ngayo.
I would love to see how that happens.	Ndingathanda ukubona ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
Here is another story.	Kwakhona elinye ibali.
Marriage, really.	Umtshato, ngokwenene.
It can be just a small thing.	Inokuba yinto nje encinci.
But you can do it, if you really want to.	Kodwa ungayenza, ukuba ufuna ngokwenene.
We know you want money.	Siyazi ukuba ufuna imali.
Nothing bad happened.	Ayizange yenzeke into embi.
He knows he can't do it.	Uyazi ukuba akanakuyenza loo nto.
He didn't know what it was all about.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni yonke.
He asked me to stay.	Uye wandicela ukuba ndihlale.
However, this does not have to be.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
It should have been this way or not.	Bekufanele kube ngale ndlela okanye hayi.
Good for you!.	Kuhle kuwe!.
But you are really learning, very quickly.	Kodwa ufunda ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Death may be instantaneous.	Ukufa kusenokwenzeka ukuba kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
I really know.	Ndiyazi ngokwenene.
He knows what is happening and knows why.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo kwaye uyasazi isizathu.
Well, yes, it should.	Kulungile, ewe, kufuneka.
I would like now.	Ndingathanda ngoku.
All right, name.	Kulungile, igama.
Yes he wanted to go.	Ewe wayefuna ukuhamba.
Anything to buy time.	Nantoni na ukuthenga ixesha.
I am all.	Ndim wonke.
No one does anything on his own.	Akukho mntu wenza nto ngokwakhe.
Everyone thought so.	Wonke umntu wayecinga njalo.
He could not stay long.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
I do the same thing every day.	Ndenza into efanayo yonke imihla.
But what a day !.	Kodwa yeka ntoni imini!.
Well, you know a lot about this.	Ewe, uyazi kakhulu ngale nto.
You have one, you went very well.	Unayo enye, uhambe kakuhle kakhulu.
He wanted to know, but he did not.	Wayefuna ukwazi, kodwa akazange.
It seemed like a good thing at the time.	Kwakubonakala ngathi yinto entle ngelo xesha.
Just one word.	Ilizwi elinye nje.
He plans to stay for a few days.	Uceba ukuhlala iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Well, not too much or a problem.	Ke, hayi kakhulu okanye ingxaki.
We'll make the night out with it.	Siza kwenza ubusuku ngayo.
He is also really tall.	Naye mde ngenene.
It would be too fast.	Bekuya kuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
It would be the other way around.	Bekuya kuba ngenye indlela.
He got some.	Wafumana ezinye.
He immediately came out.	Ngokukhawuleza waphuma.
I will make a case.	Ndiza kwenza ityala.
Or you should.	Okanye ufanele ukuba.
Then many.	Emva koko ezininzi.
I thought you wanted to quit.	Ndandicinga ukuba ufuna ukuyeka.
He is still there.	Uhleli apho nangoku.
You do not have to finish everything.	Akuyomfuneko ukugqiba yonke into.
No one was able to find work.	Akukho mntu wakwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
But please, you have to go.	Kodwa nceda, kufuneka uhambe.
But, thank you.	Kodwa, enkosi.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni kanye ingxaki.
And he is waiting to die.	Kwaye ulinde ukufa.
This place can be difficult.	Le ndawo inokuba nzima.
It just takes a lot of time.	Kuthatha nje ixesha elininzi.
I know it's not me.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho mna.
You know you have to do it.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka uyenze.
You can simplify it.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza lula.
It is good to go bad.	Kakuhle ukuya embi.
Hard, hard to do.	Kunzima, kunzima ukwenza.
I know this too.	Nam ndiyayazi le nto.
It's also a bike.	Kwakhona ibhayisekile.
I mean talk to her.	Ndithetha ukuthetha naye.
Because of both of us.	Ngenxa yethu sobabini.
So, very thoughtful.	Ngoko, ukucinga kakhulu.
However, that is not possible.	Kodwa ke, oko akunakwenzeka.
But he knew he couldn't do it right away.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akanakuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
I had to stay in place.	Kwafuneka ndihlale kwindawo.
Or that is my hope.	Okanye lithemba lam elo.
Dinner at his house.	Isidlo endlwini yakhe.
I don't like it all.	Andiyithandi yonke.
You know the big place to be.	Uyayazi indawo enkulu yokuba.
No, not his wife.	Hayi, hayi umfazi wakhe.
I want an answer now.	Ndifuna impendulo ngoku.
He can't make a decision.	Akakwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
Her father, too.	Utata wakhe, naye.
You will have to look into it now.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge kuyo ngoku.
But it really goes there.	Kodwa ngokwenene iya apho.
He did not stop when he arrived.	Akazange ayeke emsebenzini xa efika.
I can and will only do so.	Ndiyakwazi kwaye ndiya kwenza oko kuphela.
That's the only good thing about it.	Yiloo nto kuphela elungileyo ngayo.
Everyone is very happy.	Wonke umntu uyavuya kakhulu.
Why you will always be.	Kutheni uya kuhlala njalo.
I will do that tomorrow.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto ngomso.
He didn't know why, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa wayesazi.
I never thought about money then.	Andizange ndicinge ngemali ngoko.
I needed time.	Ndandifuna ixesha.
It takes a hard time for you.	Kuthatha nzima kuwe.
But he did not go home.	Kodwa akazange agoduke.
And that will go to me and you.	Kwaye oko kuya kum nawe.
And what are you going to do about it?	Kwaye uya kwenza ntoni ngaloo nto.
Definitely beautiful.	Ngokuqinisekileyo mhle.
Doing the right thing for him.	Ukwenza into elungileyo ngaye.
He was going to make a speech.	Wayeza kwenza intetho.
I can't think of anything with him.	Andikwazi ukucinga nto naye.
I wonder who that might be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba inokuba ngubani lowo.
I hope .	Ndiyathemba .
And now it is no longer possible.	Kwaye ngoku akunakwenzeka ngakumbi.
Everything comes after that.	Yonke into iza emva koko.
Well, maybe it's okay.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ilungile.
There is alcohol where it is good.	Kukho utywala apho kulungile.
Yes, not yet.	Ewe, hayi okwangoku.
But otherwise you are doing well.	Kodwa ngenye indlela uqhuba kakuhle.
You know very well, though.	Uyazi kakuhle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
And then there's his place.	Kwaye ke kukho indawo yakhe.
I think yes.	Ndicinga ukuba ewe.
Everything is very difficult.	Konke kunzima kakhulu.
And you should.	Kwaye ufanele.
No one took that from you.	Akukho mntu wathatha oko kuwe.
I am here to do this better.	Ndilapha ukwenza oku ngcono.
He just has to have it.	Kufuneka nje abe nayo.
I think it is good for all of us.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile kuthi sonke.
I know what you are doing.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza ntoni na.
Why do you want to do that ?.	Kutheni ufuna ukuyenza lonto?.
It makes the meal even more delicious.	Kwenza isidlo ngakumbi.
But after that she did not speak to him all day.	Kodwa emva koko akazange athethe naye imini yonke.
I'm sure it will be something new.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba iya kuba yinto entsha.
However, he does not appear.	Nangona kunjalo, akabonakali.
I stared at it for a long time.	Ndijonge kuyo ixesha elide.
I wanted to know about him.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ngaye.
I'm not sure what the answer is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni impendulo.
He never tried to say anything again.	Akazange aphinde azame ukuthetha nto.
As it is, that's fine.	Njengoko kunjalo, kulungile.
And not so much.	Kwaye akukho kakhulu.
Not here, not there.	Hayi apha, hayi phaya.
If not, your coat will do.	Ukuba akunjalo, idyasi yakho iya kwenza.
You read very fast.	Ufunda ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
So, what?!.	Ngoko, yintoni?!.
Slowly, if you want to know the truth.	Kancinci, ukuba ufuna ukwazi inyani.
I'm sorry about that now.	Ndicela uxolo ngalonto ngoku.
But look at that.	Kodwa jonga loo nto.
But no, and yet.	Kodwa hayi, kwaye nangona kunjalo.
I love the place, though everything.	Ndiyayithanda indawo, nangona yonke into.
In the same way he does everyone.	Ngendlela efanayo wenza wonke umntu.
As good as it is.	Njengoko kuhle.
He never told me where the place was.	Akazange andixelele ukuba iphi indawo.
He returned to my room.	Wabuyela egumbini lam.
We went everywhere together.	Sihambe yonke indawo kunye.
It wasn't easy, but he managed.	Akuzange kube lula, kodwa wakwazi.
You have to buy one.	Kufuneka uthenge enye.
But he wanted to go.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuhamba.
Whatever happens at this time.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na ngeli xesha.
It's the same thing with you now.	Yinto enye nawe ngoku.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha asiyonto.
This is not going to happen, of course.	Oku akuyi kwenzeka, kunjalo.
That, of course, is not the case.	Oko, akunjalo, akunjalo.
We will be back before dinner.	Siza kubuya phambi kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
They live here and now.	Bahlala apha kwaye ngoku.
I am the way.	Ndim indlela.
Before that, probably.	Ngaphambi koko, mhlawumbi.
Otherwise, everything will do.	Ngaphandle koko, yonke into iya kwenza.
He came in force.	Wangena ngamandla.
He has to say that.	Kufuneka athethe loo nto.
She does her homework as soon as she gets home.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe wesikolo wasekhaya kanye xa efika ekhaya.
Probably very, very much so.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu, kakhulu.
There is no place for him here.	Apha akukho ndawo yakhe.
He sat in front.	Wahlala ngaphambili.
Making a bad place.	Ukwenza indawo embi.
You represent your friends.	Umele abahlobo bakho.
I just did just that.	Ndenze nje kunjalo.
It was not necessary to talk too much.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuthetha kakhulu.
This is a player.	Le ngumdlali.
It is my job to know.	Ngumsebenzi wam ukwazi.
Then he lay down inside of me.	Emva koko walala phantsi ngaphakathi kwam.
Yes it seems.	Ewe kubonakala ngathi kunjalo.
Three years, too.	Iminyaka emithathu, nayo.
And they will all see.	Kwaye bonke baya kubona.
Someone other than me.	Omnye umntu ngaphandle kwam.
He wanted to do something bigger.	Wayefuna ukwenza into enkulu ngakumbi.
Does anyone know why this might be?	Ngaba umntu uyazi ukuba kutheni le nto inokuba?
I could not stop eating.	Khange ndikwazi ukuyeka ukutya.
Yes, you do as you wish.	Ewe, wenza njengoko ufuna.
So really this question needs questions.	Ngoko ngokwenene lo mbuzo kufuneka imibuzo.
You like to play your music a little higher.	Uthanda ukudlala umculo wakho phezulu kancinci.
No, nothing happened.	Hayi, akukho nto yenzekileyo.
Talk to him about it.	Ukuthetha naye ngayo.
No, it should not happen.	Hayi, akufunekanga yenzeke.
He handed the ball to the ball.	Wanika ibhola ibhola.
Now, he ran away.	Ngoku, wabaleka.
You're driving a little bit now.	Uqhuba kancinci ngoku.
You do not know how lucky you are.	Awuyazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani na.
It certainly seems to be true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi yinyani.
Well, you always think about that.	Ke kunjalo, uhlala ucinga ngaloo nto.
I was nothing.	Andizange ndibe nto.
That happened before.	Oko kwenzeka ngaphambili.
It is also possible to do too much.	Kwakhona kunokwenzeka ukwenza kakhulu.
The problem is, you think so.	Ingxaki kukuba, ucinga ukuba kunjalo.
No one told me this.	Akukho mntu wandixelela oku.
Well, he tried, of course.	Ewe, wazama, kunjalo.
I've had to do that before.	Kuye kwafuneka ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
Because it didn't.	Ngenxa yokuba ayizange.
To you and me both.	Kuwe kunye nam sobabini.
Today, one.	Namhlanje, enye.
But so are you.	Kodwa nawe unjalo.
He did something with it.	Wenza into ngayo.
Someone after all took a chance on you before.	Umntu emva kwakho konke wathatha ithuba kuwe ngaphambili.
He walked back to the car.	Wahamba wabuyela emotweni.
Three weeks.	Iiveki ezintathu.
He thought he had more time.	Wayecinga ukuba unexesha elingakumbi.
Then he left the house.	Emva koko waphuma endlwini.
He knew what we were going to be.	Wayesazi ukuba siya kuba yintoni na.
He has spoken too much.	Uye wathetha kakhulu.
However, it is not very frequent.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho rhoqo kakhulu.
That takes a few weeks.	Oko kuthatha iiveki ezimbalwa.
I have to do that first.	Kufuneka ndenze oko kuqala.
But enough.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
So much for one thing.	Kakhulu into enye.
Maybe we'll do it someday.	Mhlawumbi siza kuyenza ngenye imini.
Thank you very much .	Enkosi kakhulu .
But even that is not possible.	Kodwa nangona oko akunakwenzeka.
And you are lucky for him.	Kwaye unethamsanqa kuye.
We all want you to go with us.	Sonke sifuna ukuba uhambe nathi.
And yet one should not be too angry.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo umntu akufuneki abe nomsindo kakhulu.
Such is the man.	Unjalo ke umntu.
You never knew.	Awuzange ukwazi.
Therefore, it is possible that.	Ngoko ke, kusenokwenzeka ukuba.
So we need something else.	Ngoko sifuna enye into.
It's hard to find.	Kunzima ukufumana.
That is a long time ago.	Lixesha elide elo kude kangaka.
There is no danger for us.	Akukho ngozi kuthi.
Look up at me.	Jonga phezulu kum.
So this goes on all day.	Ngoko oku kuqhubeka imini yonke.
It also takes time.	Kwakhona kuthatha ixesha.
So if you have done this far, thank you.	Ngoko ukuba uyenzile le kude, enkosi.
The doctor stayed with me.	Ugqirha wahlala nam.
There is no reason to be beautiful.	Akukho sizathu sokuba mhle.
Why should he do it? 	Kutheni kufuneka ayenze?
He wanted to help, but he did not know how.	Wayefuna ukunceda, kodwa wayengazi ukuba njani.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe ilungile loo nto.
He knew he didn't have to do that.	Wayesazi ukuba akufuneki ayenze loo nto.
It will definitely do this again !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuyenza le nto kwakhona!.
Yes thank you for that.	Ewe enkosi ngaloo nto.
He tried to help.	Wazama ukunceda.
And sooner or later.	Kwaye kungekudala okanye kamva.
There is a problem, though.	Kukho ingxaki, nangona kunjalo.
He soon became a friend.	Ngokukhawuleza waba ngumhlobo.
He talked to me about it.	Wathetha nam ngayo.
He left alone.	Wemka yedwa.
So much so.	Ngoko ke kakhulu.
Really, this is what it means to be a man.	Ngokwenene, oku koko kuthetha ukuba yindoda.
And the more, the better.	Kwaye ngakumbi, ngcono.
He did not want more time.	Akazange afune ixesha elingakumbi.
The nights are over.	Ubusuku bahlala.
It has not been easy.	Akazange abe lula.
What is my problem, he wondered.	Yintoni ingxaki yam, wazibuza.
Thus he must have been unable to do so.	Ngaloo ndlela umele ukuba akazange akwazi ukwenjenjalo.
You want to achieve everything at all times.	Ufuna ukuphumelela yonke into ngalo lonke ixesha.
Steal a car if necessary.	Ube imoto ukuba kufuneka.
Finding things now will be much easier.	Ukufumana izinto ngoku kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
For now, it's you.	Okwangoku, nguwe.
Unless it is not at all.	Ngaphandle kokuba akunjalo kwaphela.
But maybe not, too.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo, kakhulu.
I will not be.	Andiyi kuba njalo.
And not very well.	Kwaye hayi kakuhle kakhulu.
And maybe he won't.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akayi.
This place here.	Le ndawo apha.
So he came and told us about it.	Ngoko weza waza wathetha nathi ngayo.
And, that's true.	Kwaye, yinyani leyo.
So yeah, there it is.	Ngoko ewe, kukho loo nto.
And look again.	Kwaye jonga kwakhona.
But then again, isn’t it always ?.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, akunjalo rhoqo?.
I saw only one.	Ndibone enye kuphela.
I think it's something.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto ethile.
And meanwhile, of course, he does.	Kwaye okwangoku, kunjalo, wenza.
This was nothing, really.	Oku kwakungekho nto, ngokwenene.
He thought he knew everyone.	Wayecinga ukuba wazi wonke umntu.
Of course, he thought.	Kunjalo, wacinga.
You have to come to me.	Kufuneka uze kum.
I did all this myself.	Yonke lento ndiyenze ngokwam.
There is certainly no breakfast.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho isidlo sakusasa.
This appears again and again.	Oku kubonakala kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I hope it will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kwenza njalo.
No, he is not alone.	Hayi, ayinguye yedwa.
He will take anything.	Uya kuthatha nantoni na.
You just want to be here.	Ufuna nje ukuba lapha.
Where this will take the music, we will see.	Apho oku kuya kuthatha umculo, siza kubona.
Not that but when.	Hayi ukuba kodwa nini.
But he is very tired from the work.	Kodwa udiniwe kakhulu ngumsebenzi.
It is something that will take time.	Yinto eza kuthatha ixesha.
No, this is fine.	Hayi, oku kulungile.
To me, that is a bad thing.	Ke kum, yinto engalunganga.
He told police, however.	Waxelela amapolisa, kodwa .
Everything before it is done.	Yonke into ngaphambi kokuba yenziwe.
This is going to take time, too.	Oku kuza kuthatha ixesha, kakhulu.
You have to stay there.	Kufuneka uhlale apho.
Maybe it's your thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto yakho.
And to him, too.	Kwaye kuye, naye.
So you come here.	Ngoko uza apha.
He did not win all night.	Akazange aphumelele ubusuku bonke.
Everything is strange.	Yonke into engaqhelekanga.
Good as long as it doesn't.	Kuhle kude kube akunjalo.
Making a way.	Ukwenza indlela.
However, no one knows for sure.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You are good and like you.	Ulungile kwaye ufana nawe.
She sat on the bed next to him.	Wahlala ebhedini ecaleni kwakhe.
He’s going to be his player, too, no matter what.	Uya kuba ngumdlali wakhe, naye, nokuba yintoni na.
I think thinking.	Ndicinga ukucinga.
I can't get out of the house.	Andikwazi ukuphuma endlwini.
I already know everything.	Sele ndiyazi yonke into.
You have already done it once.	Sele uyenzile kanye.
I can say it all.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha konke.
He would arrive that afternoon.	Wayeza kufika ngaloo mvakwemini.
He never stopped reading.	Akazange ayeke ukufunda.
So much for that.	Kakhulu ukuba.
He didn't go far, but he did.	Akazange aye kude, kodwa uyenzile.
Although he did not say much.	Nangona akazange athethe kakhulu.
So you don't have to stay with me.	Ngoko ke akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhlale nam.
Probably in this book.	Mhlawumbi kule ncwadi.
Is probably.	Ngaba mhlawumbi .
That means us.	Oko kuthetha kuthi.
Finally he left.	Ekugqibeleni wahamba.
You will not need anything.	Awuyi kufuna nto.
This is great, you know.	Oku kakhulu, ubusazi.
When something like that happens again.	Xa kwenzeka into enjalo kwakhona.
Do it again.	Ngaba kwakhona.
Not all night, but always.	Hayi ubusuku bonke, kodwa rhoqo.
He says a few things.	Uthetha izinto ezimbalwa.
So please do so.	Ngoko ke nceda wenze njalo.
But again he did nothing.	Kodwa kwakhona akazange enze nto.
Now he asked my name.	Ngoku wabuza igama lam.
I hope you know how it goes.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba kuhamba njani.
Do you know what this could be?	Ngaba uyazi ukuba inokuba yintoni le.
This is hard to imagine now.	Oku kunzima ukucinga ngoku.
I mean I really like it.	Ndithetha ukuba ndiyayithanda ngokwenene.
However, it is possible that.	Kodwa ke, kusenokwenzeka ukuba .
Better, though.	Kungcono, nangona kunjalo.
He did not know otherwise.	Wayengazi ngenye indlela.
I could not do anything without you.	Andikwazanga ukwenza nantoni na ngaphandle kwakho.
And yes this is difficult.	Kwaye ewe oku kunzima.
And not really getting anywhere.	Kwaye hayi ngokwenene ukufumana nayiphi na indawo.
We have to be tough.	Sifanele ukuba nzima.
I don't want to tell you.	Andifuni ukukuxelela.
Something is happening here, more than you know.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha, ngaphezu kokuba uyazi.
All you have to look for is three years.	Konke kufuneka ujonge iminyaka emithathu.
No one expects him to do so.	Akukho mntu ulindele ukuba enjenjalo.
I could not think straight.	Andikwazanga ukucinga kakuhle.
We do not have to do it again now, however.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba siyenze kwakhona ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
Not just in the bedroom but all the time.	Hayi nje kwigumbi lokulala kodwa ngalo lonke ixesha.
You and I don't have to go through it.	Mna nawe akufuneki sihambe kuyo.
Moreover, that.	Ngaphezu koko, oko.
And it probably is.	Kwaye kusenokwenzeka ukuba kunjalo.
It's really hard to do anything all day.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza nto imini yonke.
You are everyone, it would be great.	Ungumntu wonke, kuya kuba kuhle.
Now look.	Ngoku jonga .
Or now it seems to us.	Okanye ngoku kubonakala ngathi.
Just as he has to do.	Kanye njengoko kufuneka enze njalo.
Yes my mistake.	Ewe impazamo yam.
Now, you too.	Ngoku, nawe.
Tell me what.	Ndixelele ntoni.
I can't at all.	Andikwazi kwaphela.
What and where.	Yintoni kwaye phi.
He would make this easier.	Wayeza kwenza oku kube lula.
Something terrible happened to him.	Kwenzeka into embi kuye.
Thank you so much for being with us.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba kunye nathi.
He did it only once.	Wayenza kanye kuphela.
He will surely return again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uza kubuya kwakhona.
I knew this was going to happen eventually.	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
You run this.	Uqhuba oku.
We will make dinner.	Siza kwenza isidlo sangokuhlwa.
We had to go just a little bit.	Kwafuneka sihambe nje kancinci.
I asked for the ball.	Ndiye ndacela ibhola.
You do not even have to buy anything.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba uthenge nantoni na.
Not just then.	Hayi kanye ngelo xesha.
You should know that.	Kufuneka uyazi ukuba.
I can not walk properly.	Andikwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
He took my place.	Wathatha indawo yam.
Maybe it's work.	Mhlawumbi ngumsebenzi.
He didn't want to say anything at the time.	Wayengafuni kuthetha nto ngelo xesha.
And someone who does this.	Kwaye umntu owenza oku.
He did not come, although his wife did.	Akazange eze, nangona umfazi wakhe weza.
My mother wanted my father to leave.	Umama wayefuna ukuba utata ahambe.
But we will get to that later.	Kodwa siza kufika kuloo nto kamva.
But making a phone call.	Kodwa ukwenza umnxeba.
Nobody knows here.	Akazi mntu apha.
Or if something happens.	Okanye ukuba kwenzeke into.
He would tell her later.	Wayeza kumxelela kamva.
He knew nothing and had to think.	Wayengazi nto kwaye kwafuneka acinge.
I look forward to meeting you soon !.	Ndiyathemba ukudibana nawe kungekudala!.
Either way he would succeed.	Nokuba yeyiphi indlela wayeza kuphumelela.
You have all the money.	Unayo yonke imali.
Finally he could see his eyes on her.	Ekugqibeleni wakwazi ukubona amehlo akhe kuye.
I think he did it immediately.	Ndicinga ukuba uyenzile ngokukhawuleza.
I have to leave right away.	Kufuneka ndihambe kwangoko.
Out here for almost two weeks.	Phandle apha phantse iiveki ezimbini.
He really exists.	Ukhona ngenene.
But this is taking too long.	Kodwa oku kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
Impossible now.	Akunakwenzeka ngoku.
You will not want to talk to him at all.	Awuyi kufuna ukuthetha naye kwaphela.
You only want to play.	Ufuna ukudlala kuphela.
Yes, it could be me.	Ewe, inokuba ndim.
Clearly he could not do that.	Ngokucacileyo akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I really wanted him to know.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukuba azi.
I think it will take time.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuthatha ixesha.
But it certainly should not be.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akufuneki kube njalo.
Well, that's right.	Kulungile, kunjalo ngokwenene.
No, it's better this way.	Hayi, kungcono ngale ndlela.
He needed someone to talk to.	Wayefuna umntu oza kuthetha naye ngolo hlobo.
Succeeding for a long time.	Ukuphumelela ixesha elide.
But you have to look at everything.	Kodwa kufuneka ujonge kuyo yonke into.
Well, you have to say this right away.	Kulungile, kufuneka uthethe oku kwangoko.
The doctor says you should not talk too much.	Ugqirha uthi akufuneki uthethe kakhulu.
Every answer, too.	Yonke impendulo, nayo.
I want to know more about him.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngaye.
Or he may be doing what he wants to do.	Okanye usenokuba wenza into ayifunayo.
I made a quick decision.	Ndenze isigqibo ngokukhawuleza.
You are here, no.	Ulapha, hayi.
He must have slept for years.	Umele ukuba walala iminyaka.
But it is not, it is not.	Kodwa akunjalo, akunjalo.
He does not have to do this.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ayenze le nto.
He just does everything together.	Wenza nje yonke into kunye.
Before we leave, he will leave.	Ngaphambi kokuba sihambe, uya kuhamba.
So no one is at home.	Ngoko akukho mntu ekhaya.
One has to be first.	Umntu kufuneka abe kuqala.
If you do a good job.	Ukuba wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
I do not want to tell him his name.	Andifuni kumxelela igama lakhe.
He talked a lot about her.	Wayethetha ngaye kakhulu.
I want a girl now.	Ndifuna intombi ngoku.
Everyone eventually does it.	Wonke umntu ekugqibeleni uyayenza.
I do not want to go.	Andifuni kuhamba.
There are two things.	Kukho izinto ezimbini.
For all that in town.	Kuyo yonke loo nto edolophini.
You should always do that.	Kufuneka usoloko uyenza loo nto.
It's all in us.	Konke kukho kuthi.
You did, that's fine.	Uyenzile, kulungile.
Now he won't have it either.	Ngoku naye akayi kuba nayo.
One should not be so.	Umntu akufanele abe njalo.
That is a must.	Oko kufuneka .
Being alone.	Ukuba wedwa.
Yes, he is intelligent.	Ewe, ukrelekrele.
He always speaks the truth.	Usoloko ethetha inyaniso.
A few more days.	Ezinye iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Just next time.	Kanye ngexesha elizayo.
Maybe not today, but in the end.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
I would like to go with you.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba nawe.
It's okay with him.	Kulungile ngaye.
If you have done it for so long.	Ukuba wenze ixesha elide kangako.
He told her he loved her.	Wamxelela ukuba uyamthanda.
Your wife told me.	Umfazi wakho undixelele.
He is here once.	Ulapha kanye.
I've seen so much death.	Ndibone ukufa kakhulu.
You have to have it anyway.	Kufuneka ube nayo kunjalo.
It would be with us in another way.	Bekuya kuba nathi ngenye indlela.
I looked at the picture.	Ndijonge umfanekiso.
She is tired now.	Udiniwe ngoku.
There was no one, of course.	Kwakungekho mntu, kunjalo.
I mean, really, nothing.	Ndithetha ngathi ngokwenene, akukho nto.
Or, maybe, a girl.	Okanye, mhlawumbi, intombi.
But not all children.	Kodwa hayi bonke abantwana.
And he too may be telling the truth.	Kwaye naye inokuba uthetha inyani.
The police did not agree.	Amapolisa akazange avume.
And, of course, very quickly.	Kwaye, kunjalo, ngokukhawuleza.
There was no need for him to think.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba acinge.
And now you want to go there again.	Kwaye ngoku ufuna ukuya apho kwakhona.
And you did something about it.	Kwaye wenze into malunga nayo.
Otherwise, it can be very difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I did not want another father.	Bendingafuni omnye utata.
You will try one.	Uza kuzama enye.
I know how much he speaks to you.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kangakanani na kuwe.
This work will continue today.	Lo msebenzi uya kuqhubeka namhlanje.
I had to tell her about it.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele ngayo.
This is really hard to do.	Oku kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza.
I wonder, though.	Ndiyazibuza, nangona kunjalo.
But today, this is not the case.	Kodwa namhlanje, oku akunjalo.
He is, yes.	Nguye, ewe.
But one day something happens.	Kodwa ngenye imini kwenzeka into ethile.
He did the same.	Naye wenze njalo.
Not at all, really.	Akunjalo kwaphela, ngokwenene.
It will be very interesting to see what happens next.	Kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
He hoped it would be that easy.	Wayenethemba lokuba kuya kuba lula ngolo hlobo.
I would like to go both ways.	Ndingathanda sihambe sobabini.
Three children live at home.	Abantwana abathathu bahlala ekhaya.
But you know the whole thing now.	Kodwa uyazi yonke le nto ngoku.
Which comes first.	Yeyiphi efika kuqala.
I have traveled a lot.	Ndihambe ngexesha elininzi.
Please, come home.	Nceda, uze ekhaya.
No one came in the wrong way.	Akukho mntu weza ngendlela engalunganga.
He goes with it.	Uhamba nayo.
He thought he had told her that.	Wayecinga ukuba umxelele loo nto.
Maybe that will do.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kwenza.
So what happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka ntoni.
You will want to sing along.	Uya kufuna ukucula kunye.
He will have to leave immediately.	Kuya kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
There is nothing here at all.	Akukho nto apha tu.
Now, look.	Ngoku, jonga.
It is better to stop.	Kungcono ukuyeka.
This is not very necessary.	Oku akufuneki kakhulu.
It’s hard to tell though.	Kunzima ukuxelela nangona kunjalo.
He certainly does not have to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
It would be better for us to do so.	Kunokuba ngcono ukuba senze njalo.
Do not take anything.	Musa ukuthatha nantoni na.
He can really sing.	Uyakwazi ukucula ngokwenene.
Maybe tomorrow, he thought.	Mhlawumbi ngomso, wacinga.
And it happened a lot.	Kwaye kwenzeka kakhulu.
My biggest mistake.	Impazamo yam kakhulu.
It's the worst thing to do.	Yinto embi kakhulu yokwenza.
Nobody does anything about it.	Akukho mntu wenza nto ngaloo nto.
We really did the same thing.	Senze into enye ngokwenene.
Arriving at the place, there was nobody there.	Ukufika kuloo ndawo, kwakungekho mntu.
He wants it all, and he wants it now.	Ufuna konke, kwaye ufuna ngoku.
How much do you know? 	Wazi kangakanani?
And it should not be a big deal.	Kwaye akufanele kube yinto enkulu.
And maybe not.	Kwaye mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka.
All of this is good enough.	Konke oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
No one will ever think a little about you.	Akukho mntu uya kuze acinge kancinci ngawe.
The tall man ran away.	Lo mde wabaleka wemka.
I'm not sure where to look.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ujonge phi.
This will happen when something happens, for sure.	Oku kuya kwenzeka xa kukho into eyenzekayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
There is something new every day.	Kukho entsha yonke imihla.
We'll see then.	Siza kubona ngelo xesha.
Now to him.	Ngoku kuye.
He thinks he is better.	Ucinga ukuba ngcono.
However all is not as it seems.	Nangona kunjalo konke akunjalo njengoko kubonakala.
How it works.	Usebenza njani.
I thought this was my thing.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto yam le.
It will return.	Iya kubuya.
Nobody wants to work with that person.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukusebenza naloo mntu.
I don't want him to go with you.	Andifuni ahambe nawe.
Before long, he was on his own.	Kungekudala, wahamba yedwa.
There is one more thing.	Kukho enye into encinci.
For, as it were, for a long time.	Kuba, njengokuba, ixesha elide.
Not to him, not yet.	Hayi kuye, hayi okwangoku.
You need to look further.	Kufuneka ujonge ngakumbi.
Now you know you are right.	Ngoku uyazi ukuba ulungile.
It will continue now.	Iza kuqhubeka ngoku.
To think that this requires a question.	Ukucinga ukuba oku kufuna umbuzo.
So he decided to act quickly.	Ngoko wagqiba ekubeni enze izinto ngokukhawuleza.
Just look ahead.	Jonga phambili nje.
You learn to read people quickly.	Ufunda ukufunda abantu ngokukhawuleza.
But you have to tell me something.	Kodwa kufuneka undixelele into.
We'll see how it goes this time.	Siza kubona ukuba kuhamba njani ngeli xesha.
I could say nothing to her.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto kuye.
But we will need help.	Kodwa siza kufuna uncedo.
He must have died almost immediately.	Umele ukuba wafa phantse ngoko nangoko.
I am making dinner.	Ndenza isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Thank you you are a good person.	Enkosi ungumntu olungileyo.
He told her that.	Wamxelela oko.
I do this first.	Ndiyenza le nto kuqala.
I have been here for years.	Ndilapha iminyaka.
But there is a mistake.	Kodwa kukho impazamo.
Hope to find this soon !.	Ndiyathemba ukufumana oku kungekudala!.
He went in and looked at the place.	Wangena wajonga indawo.
He did not think for a long time.	Akazange acinge ixesha elide.
I do not remember the case.	Andikhumbuli ityala.
I feel like I want to do something.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukwenza into.
He should have stayed home.	Bekufanele ahlale ekhaya.
Nobody said that.	Akukho mntu wathetha loo nto.
Or even more beautiful.	Okanye nokuba kuhle kakhulu.
We all want to meet.	Sonke sifuna ukudibana.
Not about anything.	Hayi malunga nantoni na.
So we don't have to go all the way.	Ngoko akuyomfuneko ukuba sihambe yonke indlela.
You work as hard as you can.	Usebenza nzima kakhulu njengoko kunjalo.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela ukuba.
Someone said there is.	Omnye umntu uthe kukho.
You do not have to do this anyway.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku nangona kunjalo.
It's really hard at work.	Kunzima ngokwenene emsebenzini.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam .
No, it did not.	Hayi, akuzange kube njalo.
He knows all that.	Uyakwazi konke oko.
He also looked.	Naye wajonga.
That is a tremendous undertaking.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu lowo.
But you knew that unless I told you.	Kodwa ubusazi ukuba ngaphandle kokuba ndikuxelele.
But not so with him.	Kodwa naye akanjalo.
Then.	Ndiye .
Maybe you go with me.	Mhlawumbi uhamba nam.
He will do it again.	Uya kuyenza kwakhona.
You must have felt bad.	Umele ukuba weva kakubi.
And everything is fine with it.	Kwaye yonke into ilungile ngayo.
And you never had it.	Kwaye awuzange ube nayo.
He knows no one.	Akazi mntu.
It's always the same for me.	Kuhlala kunjalo kum.
I think about you a lot.	Ndicinga ngawe kakhulu.
I did not know why before.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni ngaphambili.
He sat down, looked up.	Uhlala phantsi, wajonga.
I'll see you later, everyone.	Ndiza kubona kamva, wonke umntu.
We just want the truth.	Sifuna nje inyaniso.
However, it happened after a long time.	Kodwa ke, kwenzeka emva kwexesha elide.
Now there was no place to make a mistake.	Ngoku kwakungekho ndawo yokwenza impazamo.
I can't be in the same room with you.	Andikwazi ukuba kwigumbi elinye nawe.
Knowing what's going on.	Ukwazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
I know how it goes.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuhamba njani.
This time our problem is real.	Ngeli xesha ingxaki yethu yinyani.
He had to agree, it seemed like a good idea.	Kwafuneka avume, kwakubonakala ngathi licebo elihle.
I think a little about you for having it.	Ndicinga kancinci ngawe ngokuba nayo.
Not just at home.	Hayi nje ekhaya.
I'm very sorry, but there is nothing there.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu, kodwa akukho nto apho.
And for now, it can be very difficult.	Kwaye okwangoku, kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
So yes, for sure.	Ngoko ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
That can be very high.	Oko kunokuba phezulu kakhulu.
He refused to do it himself.	Akazange avume ukuyenza ngokwakhe.
I'm going to my place tomorrow.	Ndiya kwindawo yam ngomso.
It was not in him.	Kwakungekho kuye.
And certainly food.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ukutya.
Everything is fine for now.	Konke kuhle okwangoku.
I would like to do this.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oku.
Everyone knows this for sure.	Wonke umntu uyazi oku ngokuqinisekileyo.
You have to get there.	Kufuneka ufike apho.
And he knew why.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
That's the problem with the way.	Nantso ingxaki ngendlela.
Finally, he says.	Ekugqibeleni, uthi.
Tomorrow you will be alone.	Ngomso uzakuba wedwa.
Yes maybe any.	Ewe mhlawumbi nayiphi na.
I knew it would happen one day.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
Yes, yes, it will.	Ewe, ewe, iya kwenza.
It has been apparent.	Kube kubonakala.
I've seen him.	Ndikhe ndimbone.
But certainly.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
I wanted something to do.	Ndandifuna into yokwenza.
She tries to talk a little.	Uzama ukuthetha kancinci.
Well, well, you'll be fine.	Ewe, kulungile, uya kuhlala kakuhle.
I have to do the right thing.	Kufuneka ndenze into elungileyo.
I did one.	Ndenza enye.
That's all you have to do, really.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile, ngokwenene.
It is possible that someone will do it, though.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba umntu uya kuyenza, nangona kunjalo.
But he is talking about a lot of money.	Kodwa uthetha ngemali eninzi.
I think, obviously.	Ndicinga, ngokucacileyo.
He wanted to be alone in his house.	Wayefuna ukuhlala yedwa endlwini yakhe.
He is happy with what is going on.	Uyavuya nokuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
But the work went on.	Kodwa umsebenzi waqhubeka.
But there is something similar in this book.	Kodwa kukho into efanayo kule ncwadi.
Not pretty, no.	Hayi mhle, hayi.
You will be the first to know.	Uya kuba ngowokuqala ukwazi.
His wife was abusive.	Umfazi wakhe wayethetha kakubi.
No one will ever be better than me.	Akukho mntu uya kuze abe ngcono kum.
And another week if you have to buy a car.	Kwaye enye iveki ukuba kufuneka uthenge imoto.
No one likes everything.	Akukho mntu uthanda yonke into.
But they will continue.	Kodwa baya kuqhubeka.
We definitely need to go there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka siye apho.
Look at the times.	Jonga amaxesha.
Sorry for the moment.	Uxolo okwangoku.
Yes you want money.	Ewe ufuna imali.
I had to stay away from him.	Kwafuneka ndibe kude naye.
I want to know where the girl is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba iphi intombi.
And we have to do something.	Kwaye kufuneka senze into.
No one has a problem with this.	Akukho mntu unengxaki ngale nto.
Yeah yeah yeah that's fine.	Ewe ewe ewe kulungile.
So there is a problem here.	Ke kukho ingxaki apha.
Who do you like.	Uthanda bani.
Do you know why ?.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni?.
Death will come to you soon.	Ukufa kuya kuza kuwe kungekudala.
No, he was afraid.	Hayi, wayesoyika.
I could not do any of that.	Andikwazanga ukwenza nayiphi na loo nto.
He must be here by this time.	Ufanele ukuba sele elapha ngeli xesha.
No, not death.	Hayi, hayi ukufa.
But that is good.	Kodwa oko kuhle.
He was the first to arrive.	Waba ngowokuqala ukufika.
For me, learning from everyone.	Kum, ukufunda kuye wonke umntu.
I can almost.	Ndiyakwazi phantse .
Then it will be all right.	Ngelo xesha kuya kulungile.
I'm not sure why he is here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni elapha.
I want to be my own person one day.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu wam ngenye imini.
I hope that's right, that's right.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo, kunjalo.
Then he does.	Emva koko uyayenza.
Or is he ?.	Okanye nguye?.
Great place to be.	Indawo entle kakhulu ukuba kuyo.
It was not easy for him to talk.	Kwakungekho lula kuye ukuthetha.
No matter what happens from now on, we will be together.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na ukusukela ngoku ukuya phambili, siya kuba kunye.
Succeeding will not make you better.	Ukuphumelela akuyi kukwenza ube ngcono.
Thank you for me.	Enkosi ngam.
That's what's going to happen.	Nantso ke into eza kwenzeka.
The controversy arose.	Utata wemka.
I saw then and now immediately.	Ndabona ngoko kwaye ngoku kwangoko.
He wants to be better than anyone else.	Ufuna ukuphumelela ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na.
He knew something was wrong.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into embi.
If only he would come back.	Ukuba mhlawumbi wayeza kubuya.
If no one will be.	Ukuba akukho mntu uya kuba.
Whether that's just one or two.	Nokuba yiloo nto kuphela okanye ezimbini.
My mother wants to stay here.	Umama ufuna ukuhlala apha.
If you need to know.	Ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
We'll see if you're ready to do it or not.	Siza kubona ukuba ukulungele na ukuyenza okanye hayi.
We do not have to do much.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba senze okuninzi.
I do not know if it is possible.	Andazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
From what he told me, he loves it.	Kuloo nto andixelele yona, uyayithanda.
Something must have happened to him.	Kumele ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
This would be too far away now.	Oku bekuya kude kakhulu ngoku.
After a while he left.	Emva kwexesha uye wahamba.
Not a gift.	Hayi isipho.
However, that is not here and it is not there.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akukho apha kwaye akukho apho.
He did not want to be alone this way.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa kule ndlela.
It seems clear to me.	Kubonakala ngathi kucacile kum.
He certainly did.	Wayenza ngokuqinisekileyo.
She did not need to know that he loved her.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba azi ukuba uyamthanda.
No one did anything wrong.	Akukho mntu wenze into engalunganga.
You are not visible.	Awubonakali .
Doing it takes time.	Ukwenza kuthatha ixesha.
I had to go there once, to speak after dinner.	Kwafuneka ndiye phaya kube kanye, ukuze ndithethe emva kwesidlo sangokuhlwa.
And to see the kids.	Kwaye ukubona abantwana.
Almost one in the morning.	Phantse enye ekuseni.
Good to see.	Kulungile ukubona.
He doesn't know enough.	Akazi ngokwaneleyo.
You do not want to do it.	Awufuni ukuyenza.
Just give me a chance.	Ndinike nje ithuba.
That certainly should not be you.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akufanele kube nguwe.
But my mother was terrified.	Kodwa umama wayesoyika kakhulu.
She went to her bedroom.	Waya kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
I think it is not easy for him.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho lula kuye.
There seems to be another problem.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho enye ingxaki.
This must be him.	Kumele ukuba nguye lo.
I just want everything to happen.	Ndifuna nje yonke into yenzeke.
Unless you've been a good doctor to me.	Ngaphandle kokuba ube ngugqirha olungileyo kum.
I will go too.	Nam ndiya kuhamba.
Then he came to the room.	Emva koko wafika egumbini.
Not the way it is.	Hayi indlela hayi.
It seemed like it was going to get better.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuya kuba ngcono.
I had no idea.	Ndandingazi tu.
Work will come, better or worse.	Umsebenzi uya kuza, ngcono okanye kakubi.
I know he is ready too.	Ndiyazi ukuba naye ukulungele.
If you live.	Ukuba uhlala .
I wanted to do this for a long time.	Ndandifuna ukwenza oku ixesha elide.
And the police.	Kwaye amapolisa.
That will be just that.	Oko kuya kuba nje kuphela.
Until we know for sure what it is.	Kude kube siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba yintoni na.
But that, too, is only a matter of time.	Kodwa oko, kwakhona, kuphela ixesha.
Working from home.	Ukusebenza ekhaya.
No one, time.	Akukho mntu, ixesha.
Not that he knew what it was, then.	Akunjalo ukuba wayesazi ukuba yintoni na, ngoko.
I would really like a house.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene indlu.
But, it does not have to be this way.	Kodwa, akufuneki kube njalo.
More than anyone knows.	Ngaphezu kokuba nabani na uyazi.
So all is well now.	Ngoko konke kulungile ngoku.
This is a new thing.	Yinto entsha ke le.
Give me my money.	Ndinike imali yam.
Maybe you know, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi uyazi, mhlawumbi hayi.
However, nothing happens.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nto eyenzekayo.
Then he does, too.	Emva koko uyayenza, naye.
He didn't know everything.	Wayengazi konke.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza oko.
I do it myself.	ndenza ngokwam.
That soon.	Ukuba kungekudala.
He will go with it.	Uya kuhamba nayo.
Make a picture here.	Wenza umfanekiso apha.
I've always wanted to do that.	Bendisoloko ndifuna ukuyenza loo nto.
I also decided that.	Nam ndagqiba ekubeni.
Why and why now.	Kutheni kwaye kutheni ngoku.
She is almost gone.	Uphantse ukuhamba.
The problem is, you want it all the time.	Ingxaki, ufuna ngalo lonke ixesha.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ngoko wayecinga.
He should not have come.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba eze.
There is a dog, too.	Kukho inja, nayo.
It is the same for all of us.	Kunjalo kuthi sonke.
I was thinking the same thing.	Bendicinga into enye.
She was scared, now.	Wayesoyika, ngoku.
And, of course, the question is why.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, umbuzo kukuba kutheni.
If he wants to do it, he can do it.	Ukuba ufuna ukuyenza, angayenza.
And they will do anything.	Kwaye baya kwenza nantoni na.
And that just happened.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka nje.
I saw nothing.	Ndabona nto.
For a long time it takes.	Kuba ixesha elide kuthatha.
Probably at that time.	Mhlawumbi ngelo xesha .
That will go faster.	Oko kuya kuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Like, you know, talking or whatever.	Njengoko, uyazi, ukuthetha okanye nantoni na enjalo.
You can take anyone.	Uyakwazi ukuthatha nabani na.
And his time, his time.	Kwaye ixesha lakhe, ixesha lakhe.
I'm so glad, because you feel that way.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu, kuba uziva ngolo hlobo.
He also knew why.	Wayesazi nokuba kwakutheni.
He stays inside completely.	Uhlala ngaphakathi ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe something is wrong.	Mhlawumbi kukho into engalunganga.
You just have to think about it.	Kufuneka ucinge nje ukuba.
You have to think for a long time.	Kufuneka ucinge ixesha elide.
In it.	Kuyo .
I knew the reason, of course.	Ndandisazi isizathu, kunjalo.
There was nothing else.	Kwakungekho enye into.
So he decided to do it for us.	Ngoko wagqiba kuthi, ngenxa yam.
I think it should have happened.	Ndicinga ukuba bekufanele kwenzeke.
To you, of course.	Kuwe, kunjalo.
That creates a problem.	Oko kudala ingxaki.
In this case, time.	Kule meko, ixesha .
Even now.	Nangoku .
I just made the whole talk about it.	Ndenza nje intetho yonke ngayo.
His career began.	Umsebenzi wakhe waqalisa.
Not where you want to be.	Akunjalo apho ufuna ukuba khona.
You may have fallen asleep.	Inokuba uye walala.
Everyone is coming before me.	Wonke umntu uza phambi kwam.
We need to do this together.	Kufuneka siyenze kunye oku.
I don't know about all that.	Andazi ngayo yonke loo nto.
I will see your wife.	Ndiza kubona umfazi wakho.
But yes, it really is.	Kodwa ewe, kunjalo ngokwenene.
Then it will succeed.	Emva koko iya kuphumelela.
And it's my fault.	Kwaye impazamo yam.
Not that he tried to make one.	Akunjalo ukuba wazama ukwenza enye.
But please tell me what you are talking about.	Kodwa ndicela undixelele ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
Through his work.	Ngomsebenzi wakhe.
Lots of time for us.	Ixesha elininzi kuthi.
So again, thank you very much.	Ngoko kwakhona, enkosi kakhulu.
Maybe one day, and again, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini, kwaye kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It is the same with him.	Kunjalo naye.
I know this for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
Only you and me, then.	Mna nawe kuphela, ngoko.
Good money too.	Imali entle nayo.
Outside, there is a small problem here.	Ngaphandle, kukho ingxaki encinci apha.
No, not at all, otherwise.	Hayi, akunjalo, ngenye indlela.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi kanye.
I hope it will stay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kuhlala.
I will go with him.	Ndiza kuhamba naye.
It has to be something.	Kumele kube yinto.
Everyone works hard.	Wonke umntu usebenza nzima.
It's a very strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I did it for her.	Ndenze ngenxa yakhe.
But, we have moved on.	Kodwa, siye phambili.
But okay, everything is fine now.	Kodwa kulungile, yonke into ilungile ngoku.
I'm just trying to get home.	Ndizama nje ukuya ekhaya.
This means you are moving slowly.	Oku kuthetha ukuba uhamba kancinci.
He is here to help us.	Ulapha ukuze asincede.
I have never had a problem like this before.	Andizange ndibe nayo ingxaki enje ngaphambili.
He had to do something like that.	Kwafuneka enze into enjalo.
He knows everything before it happens.	Wazi yonke into ngaphambi kokuba yenzeke.
No mind reading.	Akukho ukufunda ingqondo.
He would talk about her.	Wayeza kuthetha ngaye.
He loves to be there.	Uyathanda ukuba lapho.
Maybe sorry.	Mhlawumbi uxolo.
Now he was alone.	Ngoku wayesele yedwa.
He said no, not really.	Wathi hayi, akunjalo.
Well, that makes it easy.	Kulungile, oko kwenza kube lula.
But one can never know.	Kodwa umntu akanakuze azi.
I have not been away from you for so long.	Andizange ndibe kude nawe ixesha elide kangaka.
Maybe this is it.	Mhlawumbi yile nto.
Not if you live.	Hayi ukuba uhlala.
He went in with her after him.	Wangena naye emva kwakhe.
He would do it anyway.	Wayeza kuyenza nangona kunjalo.
Or maybe a gift.	Okanye mhlawumbi isipho.
Or really, very, very much so.	Okanye ngokwenene, kakhulu kakhulu.
She is afraid to say anything.	Uyoyika ukuthetha into.
We just have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze kuphela.
He meant the same thing all the time.	Wayethetha into enye ngalo lonke ixesha.
I can't really find anything about it.	Andikwazi ukufumana nto malunga nayo ngokwenene.
And now you have to tell me your story.	Ke ngoku kufuneka undixelele ibali lakho.
Who wants money.	Ngubani ofuna imali.
How, it is very difficult.	Njani, kunzima kakhulu.
Or, you know, all of them.	Okanye, uyazi, bonke.
Thanks again for everything !.	Enkosi kwakhona ngayo yonke into!.
You are a newcomer to this.	Ungumntu omtsha kule nto.
That's very well done.	Yenziwe kakuhle kakhulu loo nto.
You are better than you, you are better than me.	Ungcono kunawe, ungcono kunam.
Maybe you don’t want to have it.	Mhlawumbi awufuni ukuba nayo.
And it could be more.	Kwaye kunokuba ngakumbi.
Then we will go there.	Emva koko siya kuya apho.
Besides, he wanted to know.	Ngaphandle koko, wayefuna ukwazi.
So you already know what time it is.	Ngoko sele uyazi ukuba ngubani ixesha.
You will be really angry.	Uya kuba nomsindo ngokwenene.
And we want two.	Kwaye sifuna ezimbini.
Then he heard something.	Emva koko weva into.
No more than one.	Akukho ngaphezu komnye.
I just want to give up.	Ndifuna nje ukuyeka phezulu.
Whatever is happening now.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo ngoku.
Or if he is not, then there is no danger.	Okanye ukuba akanjalo, ngoko akukho ngozi.
You need to tell him to stop doing that.	Kufuneka umxelele ukuba ayeke ukuyenza loo nto.
So people say.	Ngoko abantu bathi.
My voice on that.	Ilizwi lam kuloo nto.
I needed help with everything.	Ndandifuna uncedo kuyo yonke into.
I want more from you.	Ndifuna ngakumbi kuwe.
Older than me.	Mdala kunam.
He needs to know more.	Kufuneka azi ngakumbi.
Someone did it.	Umntu uyenzile.
I know where they live.	Ndiyazi apho bahlala khona.
It will.	Iza kuthi.
Then he looked up, he realized.	Emva koko wajonga phezulu, waqonda.
We will be able to see.	Siza kukwazi ukubona.
Is my mother.	Ngaba umama wam.
However, it is good for me.	Nangona kunjalo, ilungile kum.
I think you feel the same way.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe uziva ngendlela efanayo.
This time he did not succeed at the top.	Ngeli xesha akazange aphumelele kunye phezulu.
He told police.	Waxelela amapolisa.
I am the only one, by the way.	Ndim kuphela, ngendlela.
He started talking right away.	Waqalisa ukuthetha ngoko nangoko.
As many people as possible.	Abantu abaninzi kangangoko.
I mean eating dinner.	Ndithetha ukutya isidlo sangokuhlwa.
No one will do it.	Akukho mntu uya kwenza.
His bedroom.	Igumbi lakhe lokulala.
And that happens all the time.	Kwaye oko kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
This takes a whole day to do this.	Oku kuthatha imini yonke ukwenza oku.
And yet, nothing happens.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akukho nto eyenzekayo.
I have to stay with him.	Kufuneka ndihlale naye.
True, however.	Inyaniso, nokuba kunjalo.
Or this way.	Okanye ngolu hlobo.
You do not want to be behind.	Awufuni kuba ngasemva.
Or a woman, by that.	Okanye umfazi, ngaloo nto.
I knew something like this was going to happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka into enje.
It never happened again.	Zange yenzeke kwakhona.
And, of course, life.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, ubomi.
Or, well, almost.	Okanye, ke, phantse .
Not bad, not too much.	Hayi kakubi, hayi kakhulu.
But he will sit next to her.	Kodwa uya kuhlala ecaleni kwakhe.
I'm just trying to play with it.	Ndizama nje ukudlala ngayo.
I don’t think it will get to that though.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kufika kuloo nto nangona kunjalo.
Is this possible.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka .
This certainly did not happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akuzange kwenzeke.
And if you're here tonight, here you are.	Ke ukuba ulapha ngokuhlwanje, ulapha.
It makes it easy.	Kwenza kube lula.
No, not this again.	Hayi, hayi oku kwakhona.
And look at your mother.	Kwaye ujonge umama wakho.
Maybe you should stay.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhlale.
You need to move things faster.	Kufuneka uhambe izinto ngokukhawuleza.
Not always yes.	Akukho njalo ewe.
I do a lot.	Ndenza kakhulu.
But he didn't want to take another picture.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuthatha omnye umfanekiso.
I suspect that is the case.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba kunjalo.
We know how that ended.	Siyazi ukuba oko kwaphela njani.
That's just me.	Oko ndim nje.
I only want a bigger one.	Ndifuna kuphela enkulu.
Well maybe a little bit.	Kulungile mhlawumbi kancinci.
As one does.	Njengoko umntu esenza.
To be honest, he didn't, either.	Ukuthetha inyani, akazange, naye.
And you know it better than you do alone.	Kwaye uyazi kunye ngcono kunokuba wedwa.
I will stay in the office.	Ndiza kuhlala eofisini.
You spend a lot of time on it.	Uchitha ixesha elininzi kuyo.
He knows you are here with him.	Uyayazi ukuba ulapha kunye naye.
Only because.	Kuphela ngenxa yokuba.
I have done a few for myself.	Ndenze ezimbalwa ngokwam.
I know that will make your job more difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube nzima ngakumbi.
Well, they say.	Kulungile, bathi.
I live there.	Ndihlala apho.
We want you to stay there.	Sifuna ukuba uhlale apho.
So we know about it.	Ngoko siyazi ngayo.
There is nothing of his here.	Akukho kwanto yakhe apha.
But not long enough.	Kodwa kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
See more of his work here.	Jonga ngakumbi umsebenzi wakhe apha.
Yes, it will be very easy.	Ewe, kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
I want to think.	Ndifuna ukucinga.
She is a little scared.	Uye woyika kancinci.
At that time no one knew when.	Ngelo xesha kwakungekho mntu wayesazi ukuba nini.
It can be hard to do.	Kunokuba nzima ukwenza.
He knows everything.	Wazi konke.
Not because he wanted to.	Hayi kuba wayefuna.
I feel confident.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile.
We will stay with him.	Siza kuhlala kuye.
Dad was not in town.	UTata wayengekho edolophini.
He built a life without me.	Wakhe ubomi ngaphandle kwam.
All of this takes work.	Konke oku kuthatha umsebenzi.
But he sits down.	Kodwa uhlala phantsi.
And of course, for now.	Kwaye kunjalo, okwangoku.
He did a great job at all of that.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu kuyo yonke loo nto.
That would be easy.	Oko kube lula.
No, certainly not food.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ukutya.
So, good for him.	Ngoko, kuhle kuye.
A little older, but okay.	Mdala kancinci, kodwa kulungile.
If so, then you are in luck.	Ukuba kunjalo, ke unethamsanqa.
More on that soon.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kungekudala.
You did well to complete these.	Wenze kakuhle ukugqiba ezi.
Getting here becomes difficult.	Ukufika apha kuba nzima.
He wanted a big one.	Wayefuna enkulu.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa wayengekho yedwa.
But there is a woman.	Kodwa kukho umfazi.
But he is talking about something else.	Kodwa uthetha ngenye into.
It happened at dinner.	Kwenzeka ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
Who else, who is better.	Ngubani omnye, ngubani ongcono.
And it wasn't now.	Kwaye kwakungekho ngoku.
You will be together.	Uzakuba kunye.
We will find a way.	Siza kufumana indlela ethile.
I saw him yesterday.	Ndimbone izolo.
He is still doing well.	Wenza kakuhle nangoku.
Just thinking.	Ukucinga nje kuphela.
We need to go to him.	Kufuneka siye kuye.
He did my job.	Wenza umsebenzi wam.
I think it could be me.	Ndicinga ukuba inokuba ndim.
He wants meat.	Ufuna inyama.
I just want to stay in it all day.	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala kuyo imini yonke.
And he was not.	Kwaye wayengekho.
It seemed to be coming.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuza.
I think that's fine though.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kodwa.
Same answer, though.	Impendulo efanayo, nangona kunjalo.
He meant that they both lived in it.	Wayethetha ukuba bahlala kuyo bobabini.
That is entirely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
I can read your mind.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda ingqondo yakho.
I don't care what you do.	Andikhathali nokuba wenza ntoni na.
No one wanted to quit for a long time.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuyeka ixesha elide.
You love her and you love this person even more.	Uyamthanda kwaye uyamthanda lo mntu ngakumbi.
No one is better.	Akukho mntu ungcono.
So he did not have to study.	Ngoko kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba afunde.
He went to his house.	Waya endlwini yakhe.
If you have to.	Ukuba ufanele ukuba.
I know he wants to tell you himself.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukukuxelela ngokwakhe.
Only in this area.	Kuphela kule ndawo.
There is so much to do there.	Kukho into eninzi yokwenza apho.
You think things.	Ucinga izinto.
Death eventually takes everyone.	Ukufa kuthatha wonke umntu ekugqibeleni.
That is true here.	Yinyani leyo apha.
You will see everything.	Uya kubona yonke into.
It's better, too.	Kungcono, nam.
I certainly know that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyayazi loo nto.
Maybe a little something.	Mhlawumbi into encinci.
My wife did a wonderful job.	Umfazi wam wenze umsebenzi omhle.
We'll see later.	Siza kubona emva koko.
Not much is happening there.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo phaya.
But now it is not easy.	Kodwa ngoku akukho lula.
It is good to talk to us.	Kulungile ukuthetha nathi.
How beautiful it can be.	Inokuba kuhle kangakanani.
Then he made a decision.	Waza wenza isigqibo.
He asked me only one thing.	Wandibuza into enye kuphela.
Someone will come to us on time.	Umntu uza kuza kuthi ngexesha.
You can, though.	Uyakwazi, nangona kunjalo.
I want to see that.	Ndifuna ukubona loo nto.
I can only imagine what you think, now.	Ndiyakwazi nje ukucinga ukuba ucinga ntoni, ngoku.
He needs to eat better.	Kufuneka atye ngcono.
This, of course, is a good thing.	Oku, kunjalo, yinto elungileyo.
He turned to me and gave me my chance.	Wabuyela kum, wandinika ithuba lam.
That seems like a good idea.	Kubonakala ngathi inokuba licebo elihle elo.
You will too.	Nawe uya kukwenza.
He drives his daughter to school.	Uqhuba intombi yakhe ukuya esikolweni.
And then he shared.	Kwaye emva koko waba.
Two or three weeks.	Iiveki ezimbini okanye ezintathu.
Then, something happened.	Emva koko, kwenzeka into ethile.
There are two errors.	Kukho iimpazamo ezimbini.
Or with him.	Okanye naye.
He wants something from us.	Kukho into ayifunayo kuthi.
But really my message is right.	Kodwa ngenene umyalezo wam ulungile.
He has to go to prison.	Kufuneka aye entolongweni.
And many kids go to college.	Kwaye abantwana abaninzi baya ekholejini.
You know the truth about me.	Uyayazi ke inyani ngam.
And you want to know more.	Kwaye ufuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
I need to hear your whole place.	Kufuneka ndive yonke indawo yakho.
No one saw this coming anytime soon.	Akukho mntu wabona oku kuza ngokukhawuleza.
Only a small thing.	Kuphela into encinci.
It is a huge undertaking to do all that.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu ukwenza yonke loo nto.
I'm sorry about what happened to you.	Ndiyaxolisa ngale nto yenzekileyo kuwe.
Tell me a little about yourself.	Ndixelele kancinci ngawe.
Not so my mother.	Akunjalo umama wam.
And one did not.	Kwaye omnye akazange.
He had to say something to me.	Kwafuneka athethe into kum.
Without him.	Ngaphandle kwakhe .
He came out immediately after that.	Waphuma ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
I thought, well, there it is.	Ndacinga, ke, nantso.
Or nowhere.	Okanye akukho ndawo.
He became human again.	Waba ngumntu kwakhona.
I live before you.	Ndihlala phambi kwakho.
I don’t see how or why.	Andiboni ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
We need to do it as soon as possible.	Sifanele siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
You can't walk.	Awunako ukuhamba.
But he arrived late for work.	Kodwa wafika emva kwexesha emsebenzini.
The truth is that it is impossible to know.	Inyaniso kukuba akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
We'll see how all of this happens.	Siza kubona ukuba konke oku kwenzeka njani.
If he died.	Ukuba wafa.
I think he is, perhaps, determined.	Ndicinga ukuba, mhlawumbi, uzimisele.
That would be a good thing, though.	Inokuba yinto entle leyo, nangona kunjalo.
Maybe okay.	Mhlawumbi kulungile.
I couldn’t, really.	Andikwazanga, ngokwenene.
He knew why.	Wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Just tell me what happened.	Ndixelele nje ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
The next three years.	Iminyaka emithathu ezayo.
No one wishes.	Akukho unqwenela.
They will see it once in a while.	Baza kubona kanye kuyo.
He wanted to leave, because he tried to play more.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kuba wazama ukudlala ngakumbi.
Stop being tall.	Yeka ukuba mde.
Or not now, but soon.	Okanye hayi ngoku, kodwa kungekudala.
Well, that might be a small thing.	Kulungile, inokuba yinto encinci leyo.
Just like, right.	Kanye njengokuba, kunjalo.
We both know it to be true.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba yinyani.
But without him.	Kodwa ngaphandle kwakhe.
And he lives here for now.	Kwaye uhlala apha okwangoku.
Too much too much food.	Ukutya okuninzi okuninzi.
And it was not so.	Kwaye khange kube njalo.
He said he wanted to meet.	Wathi ufuna ukudibana.
Then comes the story.	Emva koko kuza ibali.
You probably already know that.	Usenokuba sele uyazi ngaloo nto.
He has asked for a place for both of us.	Uye wacela indawo kuthi sobabini.
Everyone walks around talking.	Wonke umntu uhamba ethetha.
Like, really this time.	Njengokuba, ngokwenene ngeli xesha.
Good story, too.	Ibali elihle, kwakhona.
Everything is done externally.	Yonke into yenziwe ngaphandle.
He just does a lot of good things.	Wenza nje izinto ezininzi kakuhle.
Nothing, now, nobody.	Akukho nto, ngoku, akukho mntu.
He never went to my home again.	Akazange aphinde aye kwam ngaphambili.
He looked good.	Uye wajonga kakuhle.
No, not man.	Hayi, hayi umntu.
He never was real about money.	Akazange abe yinyani ngemali.
So do not do this.	Ngoko musa ukuyenza le nto.
So he lives there alone.	Ngoko uhlala apho yedwa.
Here he got a job.	Apha wafumana umsebenzi.
But again, your call.	Kodwa kwakhona, umnxeba wakho.
I thought she was beautiful.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhle.
Front back.	Phambili ngasemva.
He saw through her clearly.	Wabona ngaye ngokucacileyo.
We want to be that way.	Sifuna ukuba njalo.
Only there was nothing.	Kuphela kwakungekho nto.
Does anyone know what is wrong.	Ngaba nabani na uyazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga.
I think that would be a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba yinto elungileyo.
And about me.	Kwaye malunga nam.
And not the other one.	Kwaye hayi enye.
Moreover, nothing.	Ngaphezu koko, akukho nto.
And he knew what to do with her, too.	Kwaye wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni naye, naye.
And he went in to her, and lay with her.	Weza ke kuye, walala naye.
We will try more.	Siza kuzama ngakumbi.
Either way you will want to do something.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela uya kufuna ukwenza into.
No, you can't stay the night with me.	Hayi, awukwazi ukuhlala ubusuku kunye nam.
Either way, the case is very clear.	Nokuba yintoni na le, ityala ngokucacileyo kakhulu.
But that did not really happen.	Kodwa oko akuzange kwenzeke ngokwenene.
And something similar happened all the time.	Kwaye kwenzeka into enjalo ngalo lonke ixesha.
This is your thing.	Yinto yakho le.
No, this is not possible.	Hayi, oku akunakwenzeka.
There is someone else now.	Kukho omnye umntu ngoku.
And even more, you know that.	Kwaye ngakumbi, uyayazi loo nto.
I thought hard.	Bendicinga nzima.
Just about everything except me, really.	Malunga nayo yonke into ngaphandle kwam, ngokwenene.
He seemed to know.	Wayebonakala ngathi uyazi.
And without me.	Kwaye ngaphandle kwam.
But she is busy.	Kodwa uxakekile.
He has stayed.	Uye wahlala.
Everything is possible.	Konke kunokwenzeka.
If it will happen, it will happen.	Ukuba kuya kwenzeka, kuya kwenzeka.
So, you told me first.	Ke, undixelele kuqala.
He hoped he didn't.	Wayenethemba lokuba akazange.
Or someone does.	Okanye umntu wenza njalo.
I don't want to get anything from anyone.	Andifuni kufumana nto komnye umntu.
But if something happens to me, you know.	Kodwa ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kum, uyazi.
But you don't look good.	Kodwa awubonakali kakuhle.
You look and feel so much better today.	Ukhangeleka kwaye uziva engcono kakhulu namhlanje.
It comes very easily.	Iza lula kakhulu.
You know it's me.	Uyayazi ukuba ndim.
As he finally realized what it was.	Njengoko ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
It's just that it's not me.	Yinto yokuba ayindim lo.
Her son was nowhere to be seen.	Unyana wakhe wayengabonakali ndawo.
You made one small mistake, out.	Wenza impazamo enye encinci, ngaphandle.
You did it alone.	Wenze wedwa.
Not for me, for you.	Hayi kum, kuwe.
We just have to move on.	Kufuneka nje siye phambili.
I came to eat lunch.	Ndize kutya isidlo sasemini.
But not just me.	Kodwa hayi mna kuphela.
You may just know it.	Usenokuba uyazi nje.
I feel the same way.	Nam ndiziva ngolo hlobo.
I mean it is possible.	Ndithetha ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I certainly did in the beginning.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndenza njalo ekuqaleni.
You will have everything.	Uya kuba nayo yonke into.
To you, though.	Kuwe, nangona kunjalo.
I told her about the place.	Ndamxelela ngaloo ndawo.
Me and you, now.	Mna nawe, ngoku.
It means telling the truth.	Kuthetha ukuthetha inyaniso.
But enough to do.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
It's the same thing there.	Yinto enye apho.
For almost everything.	Kuba phantse yonke into.
I just have to do my job.	Kufuneka ndenze umsebenzi wam nje.
Or, or something.	Okanye, okanye into.
Don't think that.	Musa ukucinga ukuba.
He will come alone.	Uza kuza yedwa.
Some people, of course.	Abanye abantu, kunjalo.
I mean the same thing.	Ndithetha into enye.
Obviously he can't do that again.	Ngokucacileyo akanakuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
And not just ours.	Kwaye hayi wethu kuphela.
Certainly no one said anything.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu wakha wathetha nto.
If not, then they will go to school.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngoko baza kuya esikolweni.
Very true though.	Yinyani kakhulu nangona.
I did just that.	Ndenza kanye le nto.
Or many things.	Okanye izinto ezininzi.
It will be really fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
It is best to do it with friends.	Kungcono ukuba uyenza nabahlobo.
Why do you want to do this.	Kutheni ufuna ukwenza oku.
I only know that he does.	Ndiyazi kuphela ukuba uyayenza.
The story is everything.	Ibali yinto yonke.
No one has ever done such a thing before.	Akukho mntu wakhe wenza into enkulu kangaka ngaphambili.
You will know where you are going.	Uya kukwazi apho uya khona.
Cars.	Imoto .
But he knew in advance.	Kodwa wayesazi ngaphambili.
I don't think it would hurt to tell you.	Andiqondi ukuba kunokuba buhlungu ukukuxelela.
I will not find anyone to take your place.	Andiyi kufumana mntu oza kuthatha indawo yakho.
All your way.	Indlela yakho yonke.
Does anyone know how to do that.	Ngaba nabani na uyazi indlela yokwenza oko.
You have to be something.	Kufuneka ube yinto.
I don't want her to be able to do that.	Andifuni ukuba akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I have lived too long.	Ndihlale ixesha elide kakhulu.
He thought as before.	Wayecinga njengakuqala.
Not so at this time.	Akunjalo nangoku ngeli xesha.
He talked a lot about you.	Wathetha kakhulu ngawe.
It doesn't mean much.	Akukho kuthetha kakhulu.
And you will be as beautiful as ever.	Kwaye uya kuba mhle njengakuqala.
But okay, really.	Kodwa kulungile, ngenene.
However it is not possible.	Nangona kunjalo akunakwenzeka.
Will it be.	Ngaba kuya kuba .
Tell me clearly.	Ndixelele ngokucacileyo.
But not about him.	Kodwa akukho ngaye.
There is a place, they say.	Kukho indawo, bathi.
That will be even more fun.	Oko kuya kuba mnandi ngakumbi.
And there is always.	Kwaye kukho rhoqo.
And, maybe food.	Kwaye, mhlawumbi ukutya.
But it would be great.	Kodwa bekuya kuba kuhle kakhulu.
You have to buy.	Kufuneka uthenge.
And my parents will be very sad.	Kwaye abazali bam baya kuba buhlungu kakhulu.
Not all night.	Hayi ubusuku bonke.
He said he knew this.	Wathi uyayazi le nto.
You know a lot of people in town.	Wazi abantu abaninzi edolophini.
Or his friends.	Okanye abahlobo bakhe.
My mother returned home alone.	Umama wabuyela ekhaya yedwa.
You just think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu nje.
That, however, is not entirely possible.	Oko, nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
Not enough there.	Akukho ngokwaneleyo phaya.
Eventually they will arrive.	Ekugqibeleni baya kufika.
Yes, in the afternoon.	Ewe, emva kwemini.
He also lives here.	Naye uhlala apha.
Deciding what to do.	Ukwenza isigqibo sokuba wenze ntoni.
He has come down after her.	Uye wehla emva kwakhe.
Or look at his phone or whatever.	Okanye ujonge ifowuni yakhe okanye nantoni na.
He knows nothing about anything.	Akasazi nto malunga nantoni na.
I just want a word there.	Ndifuna nje ilizwi apho.
You read here.	Ufunda apha.
But I don't know yet.	Kodwa andazi okwangoku.
He slept more, though not much.	Walala ngakumbi, nangona kwakungekho kakhulu.
This is no small feat.	Asiyonto encinci le.
And you will probably succeed.	Kwaye mhlawumbi uya kuphumelela.
And it really gets better at home.	Kwaye ngokwenene kuba ngcono ekhaya.
We will do anything at that time.	Siya kwenza nantoni na ngelo xesha.
He did that a lot.	Wakwenza oko kakhulu.
Then something else.	Emva koko enye into.
He went to prison.	Uye entolongweni.
He's here, right here with me.	Ulapha, kanye apha kunye nam.
Moving forward together.	Ukuya phambili kunye.
But, I'm sorry.	Kodwa, ndicela uxolo.
But you have to have it.	Kodwa kufuneka ube nayo.
And he is scared.	Kwaye uyoyika.
And how is it possible.	Kwaye kunokwenzeka njani.
My father is with him.	Utata ukhona naye.
How did you do it? 	Wenze njani?
I know this place very well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle le ndawo.
That didn't hurt at the time.	Oko akuzange kube buhlungu ngelo xesha.
That's it, he thought.	Yiloo nto ke, wacinga.
Then he heard a voice.	Emva koko weva ilizwi.
This is really it.	Le nto ngokwenene.
But is that really the case? 	Kodwa ngaba kunjalo ngokwenene?
I'll talk about it.	Ndiza kuthetha ngayo.
His mind is a very good thing.	Ingqondo yakhe yinto entle kakhulu.
Why, nothing much.	Kutheni, akukho nto ingako.
Yes he did.	Ewe uyenzile.
I love your place too.	Ndiyayithanda indawo yakho nam.
Do this regularly.	Ukwenza oku rhoqo.
Fast moving now.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza ngoku.
Life and all that.	Ubomi nayo yonke loo nto.
There is not much money in it.	Akukho mali eninzi kuyo.
And soon, he was.	Kwaye kungekudala, waba.
I think we all know why.	Ndicinga ukuba sonke siyazi ukuba kutheni.
No, there was no danger.	Hayi, kwakungekho ngozi.
Before you do anything.	Ngaphambi kokuba wenze nantoni na.
She thought he might love her.	Wayecinga ukuba usenokuba uyamthanda.
He wants it to be easy.	Ufuna ukuba kube lula.
It happens the same way.	Kwenzeka ngendlela efanayo.
Mine is busy.	Wam uxakekile.
No, no one has ever done this before.	Hayi, akukho mntu wakha wayenza le nto ngaphambili.
I'm trying to make my wife.	Ndizama ukwenza umfazi wam.
It was obvious.	Kwakubonakala .
What a strange thing to do.	Yintoni engaqhelekanga ukuba uyenze.
Not money.	Hayi imali.
Yes, this will be easy.	Ewe, oku kuya kuba lula.
One person eats too much, one another too little.	Omnye umntu utya kakhulu, omnye kancinci.
I thought I thought I thought some.	Ndacinga ndacinga ndacinga ezinye.
Unless, of course, you do exist.	Ngaphandle kokuba, ukhona.
It's better for him.	Kungcono kuye.
One, my age.	Enye, iminyaka yam.
That is the first question.	Umbuzo wokuqala lowo.
It is your job.	Ngumsebenzi wakho kuphela.
It's just a bike.	Ibhayisekile nje.
That might be why, he thought.	Inokuba yiyo loo nto, wacinga njalo.
Eventually he decided to leave.	Ekugqibeleni wagqiba ekubeni ahambe.
You work on it for a long time.	Usebenza kuyo ixesha elide.
Suddenly, he sat down.	Ngokukhawuleza, wahlala phantsi.
Here he lived alone.	Apha wahlala yedwa.
But only because of him.	Kodwa kuphela ngenxa yakhe.
I will do it, maybe soon.	Ndiza kuyenza, mhlawumbi kungekudala.
Everyone says here.	Wonke umntu uthi apha.
But two things happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka izinto ezimbini.
You have come here.	Ukhe weza apha.
He became a new person.	Waba ngumntu omtsha.
Just to see if you can do it.	Ukubona nje ukuba ungayenza.
I never stole.	Zange ndibe.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kubuya.
He doesn't know tonight.	Akazi namhlanje ebusuku.
This is fine.	Kulungile oku.
He wanted that too.	Naye wayefuna loo nto.
But not so much for us.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu kuthi.
I wanted to see the outside.	Bendifuna ukubona ngaphandle.
In the coming.	Kuyo kuza.
Now this is going well.	Ngoku oku kuhamba kakuhle.
You will need to know better.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ngcono.
I got in front of me a little bit about that.	Ndifike phambi kwam kancinci ngaloo nto.
And there it is today.	Kwaye kukho namhlanje.
Nobody likes you.	Akukho mntu uthanda wena.
Nice place for a night or two.	Indawo entle ubusuku okanye ezimbini.
She doesn't know how you feel.	Akakwazi ukuba uziva njani.
This happens all the time.	Oku kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
Look at the word.	Jonga igama.
Look at the house.	Jonga nantso indlu.
This, of course, is not necessary.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akufuneki.
You will find that it is impossible to do.	Uya kufumana ukuba akunakwenzeka ukwenza.
I want to improve this if possible.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono oku ukuba kunokwenzeka.
It has to be now though.	Kufuneka kube ngoku nangona kunjalo.
But, he has to learn.	Kodwa, kufuneka afunde.
And he didn't want her to know.	Kwaye wayengafuni ukuba azi.
And it will always be right! 	Kwaye iya kuhlala kuba ilungile!
He read the picture.	Wafunda umfanekiso.
Soon you will be able to do so.	Kungekudala uya kukwazi ukwenjenjalo.
It seems strange.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto engaqhelekanga.
Just real time.	Ixesha nje ngokwenene.
It can be anything or nothing.	Inokuba yinto okanye akukho nto.
And one to really do.	Kwaye enye ukuyenza ngokwenene.
There, and there.	Apho, kwaye apho.
You certainly stay if you want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uhlala ukuba uyafuna.
I just can't think of myself.	Andikwazi nje ukucinga ngam.
He said something to her.	Wathetha into kuye.
I hope it comes soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iza kufika ngokukhawuleza.
Then, another big one.	Emva koko, enye enkulu.
I don't have to tell you anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndikuxelele nto.
He does it too.	Uyayenza nawe.
Not for you, for me.	Hayi ngawe, ngenxa yam.
You did a good job out here.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle apha phandle.
But it's just hard to make a way.	Kodwa kunzima nje ukwenza indlela.
I feel everything.	Ndiziva yonke into.
But he will not stay there.	Kodwa akayi kuhlala apho.
She is lucky to be very beautiful.	Unethamsanqa ukuba mhle kakhulu.
He did not want to come alone.	Wayengafuni ukuza yedwa.
We did it all at once.	Senze loo nto ngexesha elinye.
We both want that.	Sobabini sifuna loo nto.
I did not always look.	Andizange ndihlale ndijonge.
And yet, it is not.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
So he told her.	Ngoko wamxelela.
He cursed the controversy.	Wavuma utata.
The call will be better.	Umnxeba uya kuba ngcono.
It just has to be fun.	Kufuneka nje kube mnandi.
As you always see.	Njengoko uhlala ubonakala.
I'm not sure it's weird.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Now, you and I.	Ngoku, mna nawe.
And there is no other way.	Kwaye akukho ngenye indlela.
Please be my friend.	Ndicela ube ngumhlobo wam.
You may also like it.	Ungathanda kwakhona.
He opened the window and went down.	Wavula ifestile wehla wonke.
Maybe a few years.	Mhlawumbi iminyaka embalwa.
The pursuit of money.	Ukusukela imali.
Nice place too.	Indawo entle nayo.
Never now.	Soze ngoku.
Seeing my children.	Ukubona abantwana bam.
And there is something.	Kwaye kukho into.
You better do it.	Kungcono wenze.
I really had to learn to do that.	Ngokwenene kwafuneka ndifunde ukwenza oko.
I know how much it means to him.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuthetha kangakanani kuye.
He tried to speak ill of her.	Wazama ukuthetha kakubi.
It's very, very difficult here.	Kunzima kakhulu, kakhulu apha.
My mother did nothing.	Umama akazange enze nto.
You are not going anywhere.	Akukho ndawo uya kuyo.
I made food.	Ndenze ukutya.
As does something else.	Njengoko kwenza enye into.
You must be ready.	Kufuneka ube sele ulungile.
That's your daughter.	Nantso intombi yakho.
Then he entered the room.	Emva koko wangena egumbini.
Now look at your work.	Ngoku jonga umsebenzi wakho.
It is probably not possible to do that.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka ukwenza ngale ndlela.
But he said so.	Kodwa wathi kunjalo.
He did, but soon.	Wenza, kodwa ngokukhawuleza.
You have already done it.	Sele uyenzile.
But we had better go.	Kodwa kungcono sihambe.
Just this time you are here.	Kanye ngeli xesha ulapha.
Did you make a small mistake or did you do it.	Ngaba wenze impazamo encinci okanye uyenzile.
We'll see in that.	Siza kubona kuloo nto.
I only hope.	Ndiyathemba kuphela.
I know nothing about him, really.	Andazi nto ngaye, ngenene.
No, he would go alone.	Hayi, wayeza kuhamba yedwa.
Again, not his fault.	Kwakhona, hayi impazamo yakhe.
You must arrive on time.	Kufuneka ufike ngexesha.
The book is still there.	Incwadi nangoku.
He did not want just one thing.	Akazange afune nto enye kuphela.
And okay, again.	Kwaye kulungile, kwakhona.
You look good today, too.	Ukhangeleka ulungile namhlanje, nawe.
It’s hard to say, of course.	Kunzima ukuthetha, kunjalo.
Soon, we will do it your way.	Kwangoko, siza kuyenza ngendlela yakho.
I will be in it all day.	Ndiza kuba kuyo imini yonke.
You are a person.	Nguwe umntu.
Maybe a few weeks.	Mhlawumbi iiveki ezimbalwa.
I think everyone.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu.
I would like to see another one.	Ndingathanda ukubona enye.
The children are going to college.	Abantwana baya ekholejini.
He is the same to me.	Unjalo kum.
I love it up there.	Ndiyayithanda apho phezulu.
The accident happened at night.	Le ngozi yenzeke ebusuku.
Make me see.	Ndenze ndabona.
He knew a lot about me.	Wayesazi okuninzi ngam.
She walked out of the school.	Wahamba wemka esikolweni.
He told us, we need help.	Wathi kuthi, sifuna uncedo.
That is our whole job.	Ngumsebenzi wethu wonke lowo.
Thinking about anyone but you.	Ukucinga ngaye nabani na ngaphandle kwakho.
Then, maybe.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi.
It's not fun to be with him.	Akukho mnandi ukuhlala naye.
I think that's the only thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto kuphela.
We want you to know.	Sifuna ukuba wazi.
So this is fine either way.	Ngoko oku kulungile nokuba yeyiphi na indlela.
One time later.	Ngexesha elinye kamva.
His friends.	Abahlobo bakhe .
And driving a car.	Kwaye ukuqhuba imoto.
Very good case.	Ityala elihle kakhulu.
I mean, of course, for now.	Ndithetha, kunjalo, okwangoku.
Death is just like that.	Ukufa nje kunjalo.
It could be.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
If it's not me, the police.	Ukuba ayindim, amapolisa.
He said that he knew almost everything.	Wathi wayesazi phantse yonke into.
Here he did not do well.	Apha akenzanga kakuhle.
And the sooner, the better.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza, ngcono.
I think that speaks well to us.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuthetha kakuhle kuthi.
So this is a chance for you to go.	Ngoko ke ithuba lokuba uhambe.
Always something.	Ngalo lonke ixesha into.
But he did nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto ayenzileyo.
This is not so much.	Oku akukho kakhulu.
I don't know if you know that.	Andazi noba uyayazi lonto.
I can't talk about it right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo okwangoku.
As you read books.	Njengoko ufunda iincwadi.
It’s his big thing, really.	Yinto enkulu yakhe, ngenene.
No one talked about him.	Akukho mntu wathetha ngaye.
One will be successful soon.	Enye iza kuphumelela kungekudala.
I'd like you to look at his stuff, too.	Ndingathanda ujonge izinto zakhe, nawe.
You have your answer.	Unayo impendulo yakho.
It must have been very difficult for him to stay away from her.	Kumele ukuba kunzima kakhulu ukuba kude naye.
I don't care about any of that.	Andikhathali ngayo nayiphi na loo nto.
Someone should have it soon.	Omnye umntu kufuneka abe naye kungekudala.
I just want to see how I did.	Ndifuna nje ukubona ukuba ndenze njani.
Probably, a big dog.	Mhlawumbi, inja enkulu.
I don't know how he can do this.	Andazi ukuba angayenza njani na lento.
So we are not going to do that.	Ngoko asiyi kuyenza loo nto.
I think he finally wanted to die.	Ndicinga ukuba ekugqibeleni wayefuna ukufa.
So he's fine though.	Ngoko ulungile nokuba kunjalo.
But it is not such a thing.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo into enje.
That person should always be you.	Loo mntu kufuneka abe nguwe rhoqo.
Because you should know.	Kuba ufanele ukwazi.
I can do it, but I don't know how.	Ndingayenza, kodwa andazi ukuba njani.
Tell the police.	Xelela amapolisa.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni ukuthetha.
You know it won't be.	Uyazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
I'm not the one you want to play with.	Ayindim lo ufuna udlala ngaye.
Everyone knew he could do it.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
I never knew how good it was.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kuhle kangakanani.
Not exactly this.	Akunjalo ncam ngolu hlobo.
Isn't it?	Akunjalo na?
Yes, it is true enough.	Ewe, yinyani ngokwaneleyo.
Unless you know otherwise !.	Ngaphandle kokuba uyazi ngenye indlela!.
But it's the same thing all the time.	Kodwa ke yinto enye ngalo lonke ixesha.
No curiosity.	Akukho kufuna ukwazi.
Her own mother.	Umama wakhe ngokwakhe.
It will be harder for him.	Kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi kuye.
But you really shouldn’t be here.	Kodwa ngenene akufanele ube lapha.
You can't play like that.	Awukwazi ukudlala ngolo hlobo.
But it can be fun.	Kodwa unokuba mnandi.
Give me one of those coins.	Ndinike enye kuloo mali.
I've always felt that way.	Bendisoloko ndiziva njalo.
I feel naked enough in front of you.	Ndiziva ndize ngokwaneleyo phambi kwakho.
You do not have to do it alone.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze wedwa.
If you do, that's fine.	Ukuba wenza njalo, kulungile.
I'm asking someone for an answer.	Ndicela umntu ndicela impendulo.
My mother sat next to him.	Umama wahlala ecaleni kwakhe.
But he finally opened it.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wavula.
Little by little in everything.	Kancinci kancinci kuyo yonke into.
You have a long time.	Unexesha elide.
Someone has to do it, but it's a job.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze, kodwa ngumsebenzi.
he did not do any.	akenzanga namnye.
He went out and saw his gun.	Waphuma waza wabona umpu wakhe.
He doesn't think it means that now.	Akacingi ukuba kuthetha ukuba ngoku.
I have long wanted to talk to you about it.	Kudala ndifuna ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
I never learned to swim.	Andizange ndifunde ukuqubha.
Some stay for a week, others for years.	Abanye bahlala iveki, abanye iminyaka.
You said you could buy a house.	Ubuthe uyakwazi ukuthenga indlu.
Maybe that's better.	Mhlawumbi oko kungcono.
He said a lot of things yesterday.	Uye wathetha izinto ezininzi izolo.
Something about me, maybe.	Into ethile ngam, mhlawumbi.
And that's just one thing.	Kwaye yinto enye kuphela.
We all want him to stay.	Sonke sifuna ukuba ahlale.
When you think you are good.	Xa ucinga ukuba ulungile.
But you can sing.	Kodwa uyakwazi ukucula.
I don't really want to talk to her.	Andifuni kuthetha naye nyani.
I know he will come back.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kubuya.
I'm waiting again but that's okay.	Ndilinde kwakhona kodwa oko kulungile.
Then your voice.	Emva koko ilizwi lakho.
You want one thing, not two.	Ufuna into enye, hayi ezimbini.
But it would be fun.	Kodwa bekuya kuba mnandi.
Again, there is no exception.	Kwakhona, akukho ngaphandle.
That can be very difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Well, there seems to be something wrong.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi kukho into engalunganga.
I like it at all.	Ndiyayithanda kwaphela.
So he tried something new.	Ngoko wazama into entsha.
So, yes, thank you.	Ngoko, ewe, enkosi.
Really great in every way.	Ngenene kakhulu ngayo yonke indlela.
That is always difficult.	Oko kuhlala kunzima.
His new place, that is.	Indawo yakhe entsha, leyo.
Living there can be even more difficult.	Ukuhlala apho kunokuba nzima ngakumbi.
I think there is no reason.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho sizathu.
So what are you waiting for.	Ngoko ke ulindele ntoni.
Like, very, very much so.	Njengokuba, kakhulu kakhulu.
That's really good.	Kulungile ngokwenene.
You only know what happened.	Uyazi kuphela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But not soon.	Kodwa hayi kungekudala.
I can do this myself.	Ndiyakwazi ukwenza oku ngokwam.
It could have happened in his office.	Inokuba yenzeke eofisini yakhe.
But only that.	Kodwa kuphela oko.
Then, do.	Emva koko, wenze.
I love my daughter.	Ndiyayithanda intombi yam.
And now you are here.	Ke ngoku ulapha.
My mother came to work.	Wafika umama emsebenzini.
Anyone knows what the problem is.	Nabani na uyayazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
He should have long since retired.	Bekufanele ukuba kudala wathatha umhlala-phantsi.
You do not have to think about it.	Akufunekanga ucinge ngayo.
Well, some things.	Kulungile, ezinye izinto.
Will it mean anything if you do it.	Ngaba kuya kuthetha nantoni na ukuba uyayenza.
So he agreed to meet her.	Ngoko wavuma ukudibana naye.
But this will not be you.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuba nguwe.
Good job with him.	Umsebenzi olungileyo naye.
He brought it home.	Waza nayo ekhaya.
I just want to talk to you about it.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
I did not know it until now.	Bendingayazi kude kube ngoku.
Succeeded, if you want to know.	Uphumelele, ukuba ufuna ukwazi.
Just recently.	Kanye nje mva nje.
And then there is this.	Kwaye ke kukho oku.
Then he looked behind her.	Emva koko wajonga emva kwakhe.
Before it happened.	Ngaphambi kokuba yenzeke.
That will come soon enough.	Oko kuya kufika ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
You had to look.	Kwafuneka ujonge.
This, however, should not be the case.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, akufanele kube njalo.
Accommodation is fine.	Indawo yokuhlala ilungile.
Little did she know that it would be so difficult.	Wayengazi nje ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangaka.
Thank you so much for being with us this morning.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba nathi ngale ntsasa.
I'm glad she came your way.	Ndiyavuya kuba eze ngendlela yakho.
Yes, there are a few.	Ewe, kukho ezimbalwa.
If it could be the same thing.	Ukuba inokuba yinto efanayo.
But not children.	Kodwa hayi abantwana.
Or he pretended not to.	Okanye wenza ngathi akenzanga.
And he pretended not to.	Waza wenza ngathi akenzanga njalo.
He died a long time ago.	Wafa kudala.
His mother did not.	Umama wakhe akazange.
Just give me a few hours to go.	Ndinike nje iiyure ezimbalwa ukuba ndihambe.
Just maybe.	Mhlawumbi nje.
And thank you for all your help.	Kwaye enkosi ngalo lonke uncedo lwakho.
So all the kids.	Ngoko bonke abantwana.
But now I better talk.	Kodwa ngoku kungcono ndithethe.
He looked like both of them.	Wayekhangeleka ngathi bobabini.
Here he lived for the rest of his life.	Apha wahlala ubomi bakhe bonke .
Not me, but something.	Hayi mna, kodwa into.
Well, this way you won't have to.	Kulungile, ngale ndlela akuyi kufuneka.
They will certainly speak well.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuthetha kakuhle.
No one said they loved her.	Akukho mntu wathi uyamthanda.
How long, he did not know.	Ixesha elingakanani, wayengazi.
Please, this time.	Nceda, ngeli xesha elinye.
They say.	Bathi .
Obviously, you know that.	Ngokucacileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
And the strange thing is that you like it that way.	Kwaye into engaqhelekanga kukuba uthanda ngolo hlobo.
I go there alone.	Ndiya apho ndedwa.
Look at her children.	Jonga abantwana bakhe.
But we have to do it together.	Kodwa kufuneka siyenze kunye.
Not bad now.	Hayi kakubi ngoku.
Before he knew it.	Ngaphambi kokuba azi ukuba yintoni na.
And he doesn't show up here.	Kwaye akabonakali apha.
He has to try.	Kufuneka azame.
To know what you're working on.	Ukuze ukwazi ukuba usebenza ngantoni.
Being alone does.	Ukuba wedwa kwenza njalo.
He went in and did his best.	Wangena apho wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
Otherwise, only my money.	Ngaphandle koko, imali yam kuphela.
We'll talk next week.	Siza kuthetha kwiveki ezayo.
Although, it is not difficult to drive.	Nangona, akukho nzima ukuqhuba.
He would see what he would do.	Wayeza kubona ukuba iza kwenza ntoni na.
You cannot succeed like that.	Awunako ukuphumelela ngolo hlobo.
Obviously we know very little.	Ngokucacileyo siyazi kancinci kakhulu.
It just so happens that he is.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba nguye.
I can read a lot of people.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda abantu abaninzi.
I think she is beautiful.	Ndicinga ukuba mhle.
See the book if you are interested.	Jonga incwadi ukuba unomdla.
Time, time, time.	Ixesha, ixesha, ixesha.
So thank you very much again.	Ngoko enkosi kakhulu kwakhona.
I hope they all succeed.	Ndiyathemba ukuba bonke baya kuphumelela.
I'll talk to him later.	Ndiza kuthetha naye kamva.
We both know why you stay.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni uhlala.
He spends his time here.	Uchitha ixesha lakhe apha.
So then and.	Ngoko ke kwaye.
Sorry and thank you !.	Uxolo kwaye enkosi!.
He decided to do better.	Wagqiba ekubeni enze ngcono.
No one knew what to do and where to go.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni kwaye aye phi.
You do it all the time and you love it.	Uyenza ngalo lonke ixesha kwaye uyayithanda.
He did not say or do anything.	Akazange athethe okanye enze nto.
He wouldn't do that.	Wayengayi kuyenza loo nto.
The book is good though.	Incwadi ilungile nangona kunjalo.
He did.	Waba njalo.
And you can't do anything wrong with it.	Kwaye awukwazi ukwenza into embi ngayo.
There is nothing to look forward to.	Akukho nto ujonge phambili kuyo.
Maybe a story, or a picture.	Mhlawumbi ibali, okanye umfanekiso.
I have known that for a long time.	Kudala ndiyazi loo nto.
Truth not truth.	Inyaniso hayi inyaniso.
Yes this is.	Ewe oku.
Then just wait.	Emva koko ulinde nje.
He gave all his money to his mother.	Wanika umama wakhe yonke imali yakhe.
I do not know where he went.	Andazi ukuba waya phi.
Because it is beautiful and good.	Kuba mhle kwaye ulungile.
Not bad, but not too bad.	Hayi embi, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Little did I know that we would succeed.	Ndandingazi ukuba siza kuphumelela.
And there is a woman with him.	Kwaye kukho umfazi kunye naye.
We will find someone at last.	Siza kufumana umntu ekugqibeleni.
I'm going there, too.	Ndiya phaya, nam.
Nowhere, just outside.	Akukho ndawo, ngaphandle nje.
He did nothing, he said nothing.	Akazange enze nto, akazange athethe nto.
You just know you exist.	Uyazi nje ukuba ukhona.
You know what's going to happen this time.	Uyazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngeli xesha.
But that is not necessary.	Kodwa oko akufuneki.
Maybe tomorrow is better.	Mhlawumbi kusasa kungcono.
So, this question.	Ngoko, lo mbuzo.
Tell me something about yourself.	Ndixelele into ngawe.
Maybe now.	Mhlawumbi ngoku.
Not one thing.	Hayi into enye.
And he certainly did not.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
Mother in the park.	Umama epakini.
Well, for me it is.	Ewe, kum kunjalo.
And much more.	Kunye okuninzi.
Not back there.	Akukho emva phaya.
And, as you read, he said no problem.	Kwaye, njengoko ufunda, wathi akukho ngxaki.
And we will try.	Kwaye siya kuzama.
No one has ever looked here.	Akukho mntu ukhe wajonga apha.
He did that very well you know.	Wenza loo nto kakhulu uyazi.
But perhaps he was not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi wayengekho.
Give me one.	Ndinike enye.
Just one call.	Umnxeba nje omnye.
But to do as much as possible.	Kodwa ukwenza okuninzi kangangoko kunokwenzeka.
No, or not always.	Akunjalo, okanye akunjalo rhoqo.
And talk about it as much as I do.	Kwaye uthethe ngayo ngoko kangangoko njengam.
I did this for us.	Ndenze lento kuthi.
It will only take one call at a time.	Kuya kuthatha umnxeba omnye kuphela ngexesha.
I think he can do that.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza loo nto.
It's too late to wait.	Kudala ukulinda.
Room or two.	Igumbi okanye ezimbini.
He gave it to me.	Uye wandinika yona.
How are you sleeping.	Ulele njani.
You work your way to making alcohol.	Usebenza ngendlela yakho yokwenza utywala.
You have one for you.	Unayo enye kuwe.
But he just has to stay in prison.	Kodwa kufuneka nje ahlale entolongweni.
So, this question.	Ngoko ke, lo mbuzo.
But now it is very difficult.	Kodwa ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
The truth comes from behind.	Inyani iza ngasemva.
I could not sit still and see clearly.	Khange ndikwazi tu ukuhlala ndibone kakuhle.
And no one ever did that.	Kwaye akukho mntu wakha wayenza loo nto.
I never had a mind.	Andizange ndibe nayo ingqondo.
He is a really new restaurant.	Nguye indawo yokutyela entsha ngokwenene.
You really mean it.	Uthetha ngokwenene.
He did not want to eat alone.	Wayengafuni ukutya yedwa.
Maybe later, finally.	Mhlawumbi kamva, ekugqibeleni.
Certainly the further away you are the better.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba phambili kude ungcono.
So stop trying to make it harder.	Ngoko ke yeka ukuzama ukwenza kube nzima.
That is a strange thing.	Yinto engaqhelekanga ke leyo.
Who needs help.	Ngubani ofuna uncedo.
If anyone.	Ukuba nabani na.
This is probably not going to be fun.	Oku mhlawumbi akuyi kuba mnandi.
He wanted more from us.	Wayefuna into eninzi kuthi.
I don't want to say anything.	Andifuni kuthetha nto.
So it's better to stay in this, you think.	Ngoko kungcono ukuhlala kule, ucinga.
So you have to do it for him.	Ngoko kufuneka wenze kuye.
An image already exists.	Umfanekiso sele ukhona.
If you like it then.	Ukuba ungathanda kunjalo.
And this is all happening.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka konke.
I'll sit in the back.	Ndiza kuhlala ngasemva.
And then at home,.	Kwaye ke ekhaya,.
I also do not believe in it.	Nam andikholelwa kuyo.
Maybe he likes it or not.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda okanye akayithandi.
This makes it easier to find a place quickly.	Oku kwenza kube lula ukufumana indawo ngokukhawuleza.
I should learn to sing, he suggested.	Ndifanele ndifunde ukucula, wacebisa.
It will be a little easier.	Kuya kuba lula kancinci.
He remained very educated.	Wahlala wafunda kakhulu.
It's hard to imagine why.	Kunzima ukucinga ukuba kutheni.
Or no, maybe.	Okanye hayi, mhlawumbi.
I do a good job.	Ndenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
And he had to go fast.	Kwaye kwafuneka ukuba ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
He opened now one now one.	Wavula ngoku enye ngoku enye.
I decided that this was the case.	Ndagqiba kwelokuba ndibe njalo.
And then, we'll see.	Kwaye emva koko, siza kubona.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
This is not really necessary.	Oku akufuneki ngokwenene.
He must be able to do it.	Ufanele akwazi ukuyenza.
I think you can do that, too.	Ndicinga ukuba ungayenza loo nto, nawe.
We made it.	Senze ukuba siyenze.
But the truth is no one knows.	Kodwa inyaniso akukho mntu uyazi.
Thinking about you .	Ndicinga ngawe .
Want to work with us ?.	Ufuna ukusebenza nathi?.
And no one makes a lot of money by doing that.	Kwaye akukho mntu wenza imali eninzi ngokwenza oko.
You don't have to have anything else.	Akufuneki ube nayo enye into.
He is studying in college.	Ufunda ekholejini.
He did not want to offend her.	Wayengafuni ukuba buhlungu.
You will want something.	Uya kufuna into.
However finding an unusual error.	Nangona kunjalo ukufumana impazamo engaqhelekanga.
I did everything well.	Ndenze yonke into kakuhle.
Who did that?!.	Ngubani owenza loo nto?!.
Don't be me.	Musa ukuba ndim.
Here, no.	Apha, hayi.
I think you should talk to him.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uthethe naye.
She was fine and arrived home before noon.	Uhambe kakuhle kwaye wafika ekhaya ngaphambi kwemini.
We will go with you.	Siza kuhamba nawe.
It's hard to be sad.	Kunzima ukuba buhlungu.
Slowly at first, and fast.	Kancinci ekuqaleni, kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
I sit in the back.	Ndihlala ngasemva.
And that's just breakfast.	Kwaye oko nje isidlo sakusasa.
This is exactly the wrong thing to do.	Yinto kanye le engalunganga ukuyenza.
Let me tell you what happened to her.	Makhe ndikuxelele ngoko kwenzeka kuye.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka, mhlawumbi akuyi kwenzeka.
I do not remember now.	Andikhumbuli ngoku.
And one for me.	Kwaye enye kum.
This really happened to him.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene kuye.
Let me say one word.	Makhe ndithethe igama elinye.
Of course, a little bit.	Ewe kunjalo, kancinci.
I think that's a good idea.	Ndicinga ukuba licebo elihle elo.
It does happen anyway, no matter what.	Kwenzeka nangona kunjalo, nokuba yintoni na.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu uyenzile.
All of this happened so quickly, you know.	Konke oku kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza, uyazi.
No one needs another plan.	Akukho mntu ufuna elinye icebo.
He gave me a car.	Uye wandinika imoto.
No one can be.	Akukho bani unokuba.
If not, fine, too.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile, kwakhona.
I don't want anything to happen to it.	Andifuni kwenzeke nto kuyo.
He knew who this was.	Wayesazi ukuba ngubani lo.
Sounds good to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile ukuba yinyani.
And you and you.	Kwaye wena kunye nawe.
It will come ready, not before.	Iza kufika sele ilungile, hayi ngaphambili.
Or if he has spent time with his friends.	Okanye ukuba uye wachitha ixesha nabahlobo bakhe.
Impossible to do.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza.
I came to do something with you here.	Ndize ukwenza into nawe apha.
I just can't have it.	Andikwazi nje ukuba nayo.
I don't want to be old.	Andifuni kuba mdala.
Why it could be.	Kutheni inokuba njalo.
He hasn't really spoken to me since.	Akazange athethe nam nyani ukusukela ngoko.
I will definitely try that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuzama oko.
This will stay with me.	Oku kuya kuhlala nam.
I wanted better.	Ndandifuna ngcono.
You will need more later.	Uya kufuna ezinye kamva.
He went with us.	Wahamba nathi.
And this, of course, happens.	Kwaye oku, kunjalo, kwenzeka.
I wanted everything and everyone left.	Ndandifuna yonke into kwaye wonke umntu ahambe.
Well, it will be the same thing.	Kulungile, kuya kuba yinto enye.
Here, you have it.	Apha, unayo.
Then you do not want to.	Emva koko awufuni.
I've certainly done that before.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyenzile loo nto ngaphambili.
This never happened, of course.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke, kunjalo.
You probably will.	Usenokuba uya kuba njalo.
Help with it.	Nceda ngayo.
So, I am just that.	Ngoko, ndim nje ngoko.
He really wanted her.	Wayefuna kakhulu kuye.
And he did that every day.	Kwaye wenza oko yonke imihla.
I had to do something new.	Kwafuneka ndenze into entsha.
At the top I saw.	Phezulu ndibone.
Finally this morning.	Ekugqibeleni ngale ntsasa.
You don't have to do that anyway.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze loo nto kunjalo.
There is something here in the city.	Kukho into apha edolophini .
And not the best.	Kwaye hayi ngcono.
But not this place.	Kodwa hayi le ndawo.
After all, everyone can't speak.	Emva koko, wonke umntu akakwazi ukuthetha.
But only when there are other people.	Kodwa kuphela xa kukho abanye abantu.
All the time'.	Lonke ixesha'.
I'm sure others will.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba abanye baya kuyenza.
I want you to always know that.	Ndifuna uhlale uyazi loo nto.
No matter what, you sit down.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni, uhlala phantsi.
I never knew before what that might be.	Andizange ndiyazi ngaphambili ukuba inokuba yintoni na loo nto.
I think it's really good.	Ndicinga ukuba ilungile ngokwenene.
Well, maybe a few.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi ezimbalwa.
You are lucky with that.	Unethamsanqa naloo nto.
That may be true, but not always.	Oko kunokuba yinyani, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
You have to do something.	Umele ukuba wenze into.
Now he came back to her.	Ngoku wabuyela kuye.
And, yes.	Kwaye, ewe.
There is no reason for that.	Akukho sizathu sokuba .
And he spoke.	Wathetha ke.
I have done a lot.	Ndenze okuninzi.
He stepped forward a little.	Waya phambili kancinci.
He just doesn't like it.	Akayithandi nje.
Now this is difficult.	Ngoku oku kunzima.
Or do something quickly.	Okanye wenze into ngokukhawuleza.
I know that there is a day and there is a night.	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho imini kwaye kukho ubusuku.
This work does three things.	Lo msebenzi wenza izinto ezintathu.
He made a bedroom.	Wenza igumbi lokulala.
If you were supposed to be here.	Ukuba bekufanele ukuba ulapha.
He does all that.	Uyayenza yonke loo nto.
See his story here.	Jonga ibali lakhe apha.
Look at things everywhere.	Jonga izinto kuyo yonke indawo.
He came down here from work.	Wehla apha emsebenzini.
I did not hear another car.	Khange ndive enye imoto.
In advance .	Ngaphambili .
I want to be that way.	Ndifuna ukuba njalo.
If anything, you will be better off.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na, uya kuba ngcono.
She was afraid to be late.	Wayesoyika ukufika emva kwexesha .
He tried again, more.	Wazama kwakhona, ngakumbi.
Or having children.	Okanye ukuba nabantwana.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala .
I also have no future.	Nam andinayo phambili.
He did not think that he would ever do that.	Wayengacingi ukuba uya kuze abe njalo.
Good night.	Kuhle ngokuhlwanje.
He will be seen.	Uya kubonakala.
They will certainly say yes.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuthi ewe.
Bedtime for people.	Ixesha lokulala abantu.
That's right, at first.	Kunjalo, ekuqaleni.
I've been there before.	Ndikhe ndaya phaya ngaphambili.
I think he has stayed in his room.	Ndicinga ukuba uye wahlala egumbini lakhe.
No one agreed to anything.	Akukho mntu wavuma nantoni na.
I, however, do not know how I did it.	Mna, nangona kunjalo, andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
He wanted her to come once.	Wayefuna ukuba eze kanye.
Although, not uncommon.	Nangona, hayi engaqhelekanga.
It could be.	Inokuba .
I feel completely forgotten.	Ndiziva ndilibele ngokupheleleyo.
So he would do it again.	Ngoko wayeza kuphinda.
Finally, there is peace.	Ekugqibeleni, kukho uxolo.
It's something else.	Yinto enye into.
You will not have to wait long.	Akuyi kufuneka ulinde ixesha elide.
No, that's you.	Hayi, nguwe lowo.
He said yes.	Wathi kunjalo.
Looks like he did.	Kubonakala ngathi wenze njalo.
Nothing will happen to me.	Akukho nto iza kwenzeka kum.
Your mother, however.	Umama wakho, nangona kunjalo.
Work is coming quickly.	Umsebenzi uza ngokukhawuleza.
He does not really know that he is sleeping.	Akayazi nyani ukuba ulele.
And very bad.	Kwaye embi kakhulu.
Of course you should not have come with him.	Ewe bekungafanelanga ukuba uze naye.
I can be angry.	Ndiyakwazi ukuba nomsindo.
Nobody did, of course.	Akukho mntu wenza, kunjalo.
Not someone in the room.	Hayi umntu egumbini.
I'm sorry if that's the case.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba kunjalo.
You're right, really.	Ulungile, ngenene.
He doesn't know how lucky he is.	Akayazi ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani na.
Or a few.	Okanye ezimbalwa.
He agreed and immediately began working.	Wavuma ke ngoko nangoko waqalisa ukusebenza.
Probably too.	Mhlawumbi naye.
She is smart at school.	Ukrelekrele esikolweni.
If you feel like yourself.	Ukuba uziva njengawe.
I finally tried the truth.	Ekugqibeleni ndazama inyaniso.
Yes, today we know more about it.	Ewe, namhlanje siyazi ngakumbi ngayo.
But, that's it, man.	Kodwa, yiloo nto, umntu.
You know, just once.	Uyazi, kube kanye nje.
Moreover, he understood.	Ngaphezu koko, waqonda.
But there have been mistakes.	Kodwa kuye kwakho iimpazamo.
So they will take this approach.	Ngoko baya kuthatha le ndlela.
But it was clear.	Kodwa kwakucacile.
Do not see.	Musa ukubona.
But you don't even have to look there.	Kodwa akufuneki nokuba ujonge apho.
Suddenly, he became angry.	Ngokukhawuleza, waba nomsindo.
The call really went well.	Nyani umnxeba uhambe kakuhle kakhulu.
All right, all right now.	Kulungile, kulungile ngoku.
But it will be time.	Kodwa kuya kuba lixesha.
Because this is not the case.	Kuba oku akunjalo.
I am alone.	Kum ndedwa.
I don't know how long it will last.	Andazi ukuba iya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
I never heard of it again.	Andizange ndiphinde ndive ngayo.
But this will do nothing.	Kodwa oku akuyi kwenza nto.
The moment is over.	Okwangoku kwaphela.
Maybe stay.	Mhlawumbi ukuhlala.
You do not want to work there.	Awufuni ukusebenza apho.
That's my story.	Nantso ibali lam.
You have to think about it a lot earlier.	Ufanele ukuba ucinge ngayo ngaphambili kakhulu.
Because everyone knows it's true.	Kuba wonke umntu uyazi ukuba yinyani.
But when you do, that's fine.	Kodwa xa uyenzile, kuhle.
But he will never know.	Kodwa akanakuze azi.
You made one small mistake.	Wenza impazamo enye encinci.
It's you.	Nguwe wena.
We all know that he will do it.	Sonke siyazi ukuba uya kuyenza.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile ukuba.
You definitely do your thing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenza into yakho.
Everyone knows what money is.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba yintoni imali.
I have not been able to stay that long.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide kangako.
She realized it was him.	Waqonda ukuba nguye.
All of that can be frustrating.	Yonke loo nto inokuba buhlungu.
He just needed help.	Wayefuna nje uncedo.
I did nothing about it.	Khange ndenze nto ngayo .
He will take it up.	Uya kuthatha phezulu.
I thought it was weird at night.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga ebusuku.
Thus, he did not.	Ngaloo ndlela, akazange.
I will be back completely.	Ndiza kubuya ngokupheleleyo.
But you just told him to do whatever he wanted.	Kodwa umxelele nje ukuba enze nantoni na ayifunayo.
In the end, it is.	Ekugqibeleni, kunjalo.
Only not so well.	Kuphela hayi kakuhle.
It wasn't that hard.	Kwakungekho nzima kangako.
Everyone wanted to be there.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuba lapho.
No never.	Hayi soze soze.
And about all of that.	Kwaye malunga nayo yonke loo nto.
You know too many now.	Wazi abaninzi kakhulu ngoku.
And it can be.	Kwaye kunokuba njalo.
I've had to do it my whole life.	Kuye kwafuneka ndiyenze loo nto ubomi bam bonke.
Up this time.	Phezulu ngeli xesha.
Only three days to go.	Kuphela iintsuku ezintathu ukuya.
He said he was sure it was me.	Wathi uqinisekile ukuba ndim.
Not by your actions, but by the truth.	Hayi ngokwenza kwakho, kodwa yinyani leyo.
No, he wanted to talk.	Akunjalo, wayefuna ukuthetha.
Where it goes.	Apho iya khona.
So yeah, that's fine.	Ngoko ewe, kulungile.
I have to go on my own.	Kufuneka ndihambe ngokwam.
But this had to happen.	Kodwa oku kwafuneka ukuba kube njalo.
He went to the office.	Waya eofisini.
So he told her.	Wamxelela ke.
No matter .	Noba kutheni .
That, of course, is not the case here.	Oko, kunjalo, akunjalo apha.
My mother loves it.	Umama uyayithanda.
I look forward to working with you !.	Ndijonge ukusebenza nawe!.
It looks perfectly fine.	Kubonakala kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
This speaks well.	Oku kuthetha kakuhle.
That's fine though.	Ilungile kodwa.
Location.	Indawo .
It was not our job.	Kwakungekho msebenzi wethu.
My mother did not come.	Umama akazange eze.
It may also be that we do not need to do so.	Kwakhona kusenokwenzeka ukuba akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo.
But he needed more time.	Kodwa wayefuna ixesha elingakumbi.
Just that.	Kuphela oko.
There is always a chance.	Kuhlala kukho ithuba.
Which means you said yes.	Into ethetha ukuba uthe ewe.
The meat is real.	Inyama yinyani.
He wanted her to think the same way about him.	Wayefuna ukuba naye acinge ngendlela efanayo ngaye.
And this is so because.	Kwaye oku kunjalo ngenxa yokuba.
Also a woman.	Kwakhona umfazi.
Or it could be.	Okanye kusenokwenzeka.
Well, it's good to have you.	Ewe, kulungile ukuba ube nawe.
He understood more now.	Waqonda ngakumbi ngoku.
And this time, stay.	Kwaye ngeli xesha, ukuhlala.
He could not stay with her.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala naye.
He talks about his money.	Uthetha ngemali yakhe.
There was nobody here.	Kwakungekho mntu tu apha.
Thank you for being real.	Enkosi ngokuba yinyani.
She felt bad for him.	Waziva kakubi ngaye.
And he is certainly very intelligent.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ukrelekrele kakhulu.
Now this is it.	Ngoku yile.
I know you will want me to leave.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kufuna ndihambe.
He must have been thinking high.	Inokuba wayecinga phezulu.
Maybe you already are.	Mhlawumbi sele unjalo.
Something about him.	Into ngaye .
But talking after that is hard.	Kodwa ukuthetha emva koko kunzima.
It seems like yesterday.	Kubonakala ngathi izolo.
Every phone.	Yonke ifowuni.
It will be a new person.	Iya kuba ngumntu omtsha.
After all, that should not be the case.	Emva koko, akufanele kube njalo.
I was thinking about you today.	Bendicinga ngawe namhlanje.
And one for you.	Kwaye enye kuwe.
What are you waiting for ?.	Ulindele ntoni?.
Probably longer.	Mhlawumbi elide.
I'm happy with it now.	Ndiyavuya kuyo ngoku.
What now?.	Yintoni ngoku?.
Anyway, though.	Nangona kunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kuhle.
It’s also good, but not very good.	Kwakhona kuhle, kodwa hayi kakuhle.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngenene.
Is there really any exception?	Ngaba ngokwenene kukho nayiphi na ngaphandle?
He didn't know what it was going to be.	Wayengazi ukuba iya kuba yintoni na.
I can't tell you his name.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela igama lakhe.
That must be the case.	Oko kumele ukuba kube njalo.
Then he would try again.	Emva koko wayeza kuphinda azame.
I didn't know how but.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani kodwa.
You may be angry or something.	Usenokuba nomsindo okanye enye into.
That's probably it.	Yiloo nto mhlawumbi.
It should be easy enough to do.	Kufuneka kube lula ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
I'm not really.	Andikho nyani.
I'll see friends.	Ndiza kubona abahlobo.
But he is not there now.	Kodwa akakho ngoku.
Or scared.	Okanye woyika.
Early morning.	Ekuseni kakhulu.
It was very clear.	Kwakucacile kakhulu.
I just wonder what it is.	Ndiyazibuza nje ukuba yintoni.
So you should.	Ngoko ufanele.
Obviously, it will be better tomorrow.	Ngokucacileyo, kuya kuba ngcono ngomso.
Or about that.	Okanye malunga nokuba.
He looked down and looked down.	Wajonga phantsi wajonga phantsi.
Nobody does that.	Akukho mntu wenza ngaloo ndlela.
He said he wanted a place.	Wathi ufuna indawo.
Again, there is no question.	Kwakhona, akukho mbuzo.
This, however, he thought a little.	Oku, nangona kunjalo, wayecinga kancinci.
Surely someone will try to help you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo umntu uya kuzama ukukunceda.
That should be difficult.	Oko kufuneka kube nzima.
It means work.	Kuthetha umsebenzi.
He sits down quickly.	Uhlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
As far as.	Kangangoko.
I know that now.	Ndiyayazi lonto ngoku.
Or maybe you do.	Okanye mhlawumbi uyayenza.
But something happened in the background.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo ngasemva.
I really wanted to know.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
I think you look good !.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle!.
The doctor said it was okay.	Ugqirha wathi kulungile.
And, yes, she was dressed strangely.	Kwaye, ewe, wayenxibe ngendlela engaqhelekanga.
My father lived in a big house.	Utata wahlala endlini enkulu.
And of course there is.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo kukho.
He looked at his food.	Wajonga ukutya kwakhe.
It just takes too long.	Kuthatha nje ixesha elide kakhulu.
He felt strange inside.	Waziva engaqhelekanga ngaphakathi.
You have done it before.	Uyenze ngaphambili.
It takes a lot of money.	Kuthatha imali eninzi.
I was thinking the same thing last week.	Bendicinga into enye kwiveki ephelileyo.
He spent the whole day with her.	Wachitha imini yonke kunye naye.
You stand the other way.	Umele enye indlela.
Going to any other destination will take several days.	Ukuya kuyo nayiphi na enye kuya kuthatha iintsuku ezininzi.
This should happen all the time.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke ngalo lonke ixesha.
And that's all.	Kwaye yiyo yonke into.
So, if you are lucky, you go too '.	Ke, ukuba unethamsanqa, nawe uhamba'.
This afternoon, it happened.	Ngale mvakwemini, kwenzeke oko.
Let me tell you everything.	Makhe ndikuxelele yonke into.
I really went a little bit.	Nyani ndihambe kancinci.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi akayi kuhlala ixesha elide.
Nothing to tell.	Akukho nto ukuxelela.
However, now we know that is not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, ngoku siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
Just as it will be with you.	Kanye njengokuba kuya kuba njalo kuwe.
No you can't, you don't.	Hayi awukwazi, akunjalo.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi kakhulu.
One day certainly enough.	Ngenye imini ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
But not that time.	Kodwa hayi elo xesha.
Is it now.	Ngaba ngoku.
No one should know today.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba akwazi namhlanje.
I don't want anything to happen to you.	Andifuni kwenzeke nto kuwe.
But he will be here soon.	Kodwa uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
Very, very sorry.	Kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.
I don’t think that will last long though.	Andiqondi ukuba oko kuya kuhlala ixesha elide nangona kunjalo.
He would not see anyone.	Wayengayi kubona mntu.
Then he did the same thing.	Emva koko wenza into enye.
You can't drive too much.	Awukwazi ukuqhuba kakhulu.
He'll be here, too.	Uzakuba lapha, naye.
I doubt you will be able to.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uya kukwazi.
Yes, and yes.	Ewe, kwaye ewe.
And the truth is that he looked better with it.	Kwaye inyaniso kukuba wayekhangeleka ngcono ngayo.
She was sitting behind you in the classroom.	Wayehlala emva kwakho eklasini.
You work here, you know.	Usebenza apha, uyazi.
Everything goes to you.	Yonke into iya kuwe.
He is only interested in you.	Unomdla kuwe kuphela.
You're kidding us.	Udlala ngathi.
Everyone watched.	Wonke umntu wajonga.
He told her to do so.	Wamxelela ukuba wenze njalo.
Because he is tired.	Kuba udiniwe.
I live here, too.	Ndihlala apha, nam.
Death was no more.	Ukufa kwakungekho.
It's just strange, to you.	Kuphela yinto engaqhelekanga, kuwe.
I got next to her on the bed.	Ndifike ecaleni kwakhe ebhedini.
No one is going to buy a house here.	Akukho mntu uza kuthenga indlu apha.
Everything about it.	Yonke into ngayo.
He did not know if he could do this.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza na le nto.
And then your problem.	Kwaye ke ingxaki yakho.
Soon but for now.	Kungekudala kodwa okwangoku.
Almost everyone has the same problem.	Phantse wonke umntu unengxaki efanayo.
I may have read a lot.	Inokuba ndifunde kakhulu.
And then you can't.	Kwaye ke awukwazi.
We need to do it again as soon as possible.	Kufuneka siyenze kwakhona ngokukhawuleza.
You knew everyone.	Ubusazi wonke umntu.
But we will never be like that.	Kodwa soze sibe njalo.
That is why being human.	Yiloo nto ke ukuba ngumntu.
Stop thinking about him.	Yeka ukucinga ngaye.
But we will not talk about this.	Kodwa asiyi kuthetha ngale nto.
In prison there is nothing but time, time, time.	Entolongweni akukho nto ngaphandle kwexesha, ixesha, ixesha.
He did not stay long outside.	Khange ahlale ixesha elide ngaphandle.
This will be the first.	Oku kuya kuba ngowokuqala.
And the answer is that he obviously did.	Kwaye impendulo kukuba ngokucacileyo wenza.
I'm sure you will find a way.	Ndiqinisekile uya kufumana indlela.
I did everything very slowly.	Ndenze yonke into kancinci kakhulu.
I don't know what's wrong now.	Andazi ukuba yintoni engalunganga ngoku.
With or without You.	Nawe okanye ngaphandle kwakho.
He does it the other way.	Uyenza ngenye indlela.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani.
It is possible, however.	Kunokwenzeka, nangona kunjalo.
The sooner we go the better.	Ngokukhawuleza ukuba sihambe kungcono.
I never knew how to do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuba ndenze njani.
And, it should be easy, too.	Kwaye, kufuneka kube lula, kwakhona.
As you want that.	Njengoko ufuna oko.
It comes in handy.	Iza kakuhle.
Money will do this, all the time.	Imali iya kukwenza oku, ngalo lonke ixesha.
The doctor said he almost did.	Ugqirha uthe uphantse wayenza.
You will definitely buy that.	Uya kuthenga ngokupheleleyo oko.
That's probably better.	Oko mhlawumbi kungcono.
I wanted to be there at night.	Ndandifuna ukuba lapho ebusuku.
I definitely want to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna ukuhamba.
It's hard to call.	Kunzima umnxeba.
There are, of course, exceptions.	Kukho, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngaphandle.
Let me say something else.	Makhe ndithethe enye into.
Today is just hard.	Namhlanje kunzima nje.
We have to be.	Sifanele ukuba njalo.
Being and being.	Ukuba kunye nokuba.
My mother works in a hospital.	Umama usebenza esibhedlele.
I was just thinking about it.	Ndandicinga nje ngayo.
I thought you did well.	Bendicinga ukuba wenze kakuhle.
I deserve it.	Ndifanele .
Maybe something bad happened at home.	Mhlawumbi kukho into embi eyenzekileyo ekhaya.
Then he opened his eyes again.	Emva koko wavula amehlo kwakhona.
You like something like that.	Uyayithanda into enjalo.
Soon he died.	Kungekudala wafa.
He looks wrong.	Ukhangeleka engalunganga.
Now, there is a problem.	Ngoku, kukho ingxaki.
Just a lot of questions.	Imibuzo nje emininzi.
We did it for you.	Senze wena.
Life, and so on.	Ubomi, njalo njalo.
You will have to make a speech.	Kuya kufuneka wenze intetho.
Early in the morning, really.	Ekuseni ekuseni, ngokwenene.
Well, you think you will be alone.	Ewe, ucinga ukuba uzakuba yedwa.
Then, maybe it will.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
You told me that before.	Undixelele lonto ngaphambili.
Anything good.	Nantoni na entle.
She loves the car.	Uyayithanda imoto.
And it gets better soon.	Kwaye kungcono ngokukhawuleza.
Finding a house.	Ukufumana indlu.
But do not give up.	Kodwa musa ukuyeka.
I did not want to be here.	Bendingafuni ukuba lapha.
When he spoke, he was talking about something.	Wathi xa ethetha, wayethetha ngento ethile.
Buying a gun.	Ukuthenga umpu.
This should be the case.	Oku kumele kube njalo.
He was thinking of something.	Wayecinga ngento ethile.
But that will not last long.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba lixesha elide.
I just wanted to be your friend.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
He does it completely alone.	Uyenza wedwa ngokupheleleyo.
It will be now.	Kuya kuba ngoku.
All of this happened very quickly to you.	Konke oku kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza kakhulu kuwe.
She's trying to sing.	Uzama ukucula.
And she is happy.	Kwaye uyavuya.
That's exactly right.	Yinto ngokwenene leyo.
I know and he knows.	Ndiyayazi kwaye naye uyazi.
But no one ever apologized.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakha wacela uxolo.
They have to go far.	Kufuneka baye kude.
He wanted something from her.	Wayefuna into kuye.
Yes he would.	Ewe wayeza kuhlala.
I don't really like it.	Andiyithandi ngokwenene.
Nice name.	Igama elihle.
Then he felt much better.	Emva koko waziva engcono kakhulu.
He lives alone.	Uhlala wedwa.
I don't know where he went after that.	Andazi ukuba waya phi emva koko.
You do not have to go with me.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uhambe nam.
Maybe you've already done it.	Mhlawumbi sele uyenzile.
His mother more.	Umama wakhe ngakumbi.
I will be buying it again soon.	Ndiza kuthenga kwakhona kungekudala.
He stayed once in it.	Wahlala kanye kuyo.
Really, that's fine.	Ngokwenene, ilungile loo nto.
Now he began to think.	Ngoku waqalisa ukucinga.
There is something good for everyone.	Kukho into entle kuye wonke umntu.
He says there is not much.	Uthi akukho nto ingako.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba .
We want to do a good job.	Sifuna ukwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
But more on that all later.	Kodwa ngakumbi kuyo yonke loo nto kamva.
We will never do enough.	Soze senze ngokwaneleyo.
Only a few days.	Kuphela iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I couldn’t do better with you.	Andikwazanga ukwenza ngcono ngawe.
Every day is something new.	Yonke imihla yinto entsha.
I don’t really see a problem, at all.	Andiboni ngxaki ngokwenene, konke konke.
In the background is a picture.	Ngasemva kukho umfanekiso.
I'm not sure when.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba nini.
Picture.	Umfanekiso .
I'm not sure if you speak today or anytime.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uthetha namhlanje okanye nanini na.
There is always something wrong.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kukho into engalunganga.
Maybe a little but not too much.	Mhlawumbi kancinci kodwa hayi kakhulu.
We have to do things.	Kufuneka senze izinto.
Obviously, that was not the case.	Ngokucacileyo, akuzange kube njalo.
Or stop it altogether.	Okanye ayeke kwaphela.
But you will not get better.	Kodwa awuyi kuba ngcono.
Like you won something.	Ngathi uphumelele into.
She's scared.	Woyika.
I can't wait to get another one.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukufumana enye.
We will see how this is done.	Siza kubona ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka njani.
Everywhere but nowhere.	Kuyo yonke indawo kodwa akukho ndawo.
I feel tired all the time.	Ndiziva ndidiniwe ngalo lonke ixesha.
Yes, that's true enough.	Ewe, yinyani ngokwaneleyo leyo.
So he did not mention her.	Ngoko akazange athethe ngaye.
Now, there is an obvious exception.	Ngoku, kukho ngaphandle ngokucacileyo.
Nothing will be as you think.	Akukho nto iya kuba njengoko ucinga.
I don't know how I can do that.	Andiqondi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
I did all the work.	Ndenze wonke umsebenzi.
You probably haven't done that.	Mhlawumbi khange uyenze loo nto.
I can't believe he knew.	Andikholelwa ukuba wayesazi.
Of course you can.	Ngokuqinisekileyo unokuba nayo.
Look at my picture.	Jonga umfanekiso wam.
But he is not there.	Kodwa akakho apho.
You told him things about me.	Umxelele izinto ngam.
It will probably last a long time this time.	Mhlawumbi iya kuhlala ixesha elide ngeli xesha.
And he's pretty scared.	Kwaye uyoyika kakuhle.
We want to do what is right all the time.	Sifuna ukwenza into elungileyo ngalo lonke ixesha.
He just didn't do it.	Akazange enze nje.
I sometimes hear my name.	Ndikhe ndive igama lam.
No food for two days.	Akukho kutya iintsuku ezimbini .
I didn't want to think about it.	Ndandingafuni ukucinga ngaloo nto.
He did not make much money.	Akazange enze mali ingako.
Please tell me something.	Nceda undixelele into.
It will be fast.	Kuya kuba ngokukhawuleza.
Now is a good time!	Ngoku lixesha elihle!
This happens regularly here.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo apha.
And it will only be like us.	Kwaye kuya kuba ngathi kuphela.
I can help people.	Ndiyakwazi ukunceda abantu.
So thank him in a big way.	Ngoko enkosi kuye ngendlela enkulu.
I have to make money from it.	Kufuneka ndenze imali ngayo.
He took his own life.	Wathatha ubomi bakhe.
He opened the door and my wife looked out.	Wavula ucango umfazi wam wajonga phandle.
I'll come after you.	Ndiza emva kwakho.
Just this.	Oku nje.
I would like to know why.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kutheni le nto.
That can be very difficult to get out of.	Oko kunokuba nzima kakhulu ukuphuma.
Now he didn't even want to be that.	Ngoku wayengafuni nokuba yiloo nto.
Exactly the same problem.	Ingxaki efanayo kanye.
That work is permanent.	Loo msebenzi uhlala uhleli.
Please check the plan.	Nceda ujonge icebo .
But for that to happen this requires work.	Kodwa ukuze kwenzeke oku kufuna umsebenzi.
Thanks again .	Enkosi kwakhona .
Another really nice place.	Enye indawo entle ngokwenene.
He was going to be tough.	Wayeza kuba nzima.
It is also very difficult.	Kwakhona kunzima kakhulu.
It really is our job to do that.	Ngokwenene ngumsebenzi wethu ukwenza oko.
You know it's going to happen.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
I hope eventually we will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ekugqibeleni siza kwenza njalo.
It will be difficult, and fast.	Kuya kuba nzima, kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
She sat in the room.	Wahlala egumbini.
Obviously, you do not want this to happen to you.	Ngokucacileyo, awufuni ukuba oku kwenzeke kuwe.
This will be very demanding.	Oku kuya kufuna kakhulu.
Then some.	Emva koko abanye.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngokwam.
You can drive two or three hours.	Unokuba iiyure ezimbini okanye ezintathu uqhuba.
You feel better now.	Uziva engcono ngoku.
To finish is nothing.	Ukugqiba akukho nto.
The more you talk about it.	Xa uthetha ngakumbi ngaloo nto.
I don't even know if it's true.	Andazi nokuba yinyani na.
But that is not the problem now.	Kodwa leyo ayisiyiyo ingxaki ngoku.
And some more.	Kwaye abanye ngakumbi.
It is better to stay.	Kungcono ukuhlala.
He is also a person.	Naye ungumntu.
You better have your children.	Kungcono ube nabantwana bakho.
I think my way, to me.	Ndicinga indlela yam, kum.
We will not do this.	Asiyi kuyenza le nto.
But there was nothing to him.	Kodwa kwakungekho nto kuye.
Not just anyone.	Hayi nje nabani na.
Something is, of course, going wrong.	Kukho into, ngokuqinisekileyo, iya kuhamba kakubi.
Another question for you.	Omnye umbuzo kuwe.
It certainly should have been the other way around.	Ngokuqinisekileyo bekufanele ukuba kube ngenye indlela.
Unless the mother is absent.	Ngaphandle kokuba umama akakho.
He decided to do what he could to help.	Wagqiba kwelokuba enze konke okusemandleni akhe ukuze ancede.
I waited long enough.	Ndilinde ngokwaneleyo.
Maybe you want to be yourself.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuba nguwe.
Everyone works all night.	Wonke umntu usebenza ubusuku bonke.
It has to happen that way.	Kumele kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
His mind, he thought.	Ingqondo yakhe, wacinga.
If there is something strange, we want to know.	Ukuba kukho into engaqhelekanga, sifuna ukwazi.
To be otherwise impossible.	Ukuze kube ngenye indlela akunakwenzeka.
There are always children here.	Kuhlala kukho abantwana apha.
He studied alone.	Wafunda yedwa.
I came to her last month.	Ndize kuye kwinyanga ephelileyo.
It should not have happened that way.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba kwenzeke ngolo hlobo.
Or any, really.	Okanye nayiphi na, ngokwenene.
Food, one.	Ukutya, enye.
Or maybe it just didn’t go well.	Okanye mhlawumbi akuzange kube nje kakuhle.
Look at your location.	Jonga indawo yakho.
He went here last week.	Uye apha kwiveki ephelileyo.
See what happens to us.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuthi.
And today you can do it.	Kwaye namhlanje ungayenza.
Now he has apologized and returned to us.	Ngoku uye wacela uxolo wabuyela kuthi.
I want more here.	Ndifuna okuninzi apha.
But you have to do more to get there.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze okuninzi ukuze ufike apho.
No, not just a word.	Hayi, hayi nje ilizwi.
He gave a number.	Wanika inombolo.
Check the item now !.	Jonga into ngoku!.
Clearly, he thought.	Ngokucacileyo, wacinga.
This here is not the case.	Oku apha akunjalo.
You will probably find coffee.	Mhlawumbi uya kufumana ikofu.
I think you know that, too.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto, nawe.
Maybe one day, but not today.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
I brought it here.	Ndize nayo apha.
He said his name.	Wathi igama lakhe.
Not without help.	Hayi ngaphandle koncedo.
He ran to her and grabbed a gun.	Wabaleka waya kuye wathatha umpu.
They live with us there.	Bahlala nathi apho.
If not better.	Ukuba akukho ngcono.
Then see how you can do that.	Emva koko jonga ukuba uza kuyenza njani loo nto.
You really have to go.	Ngenene kufuneka uhambe.
I think someone is good to you.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho umntu olungileyo kuwe.
It's right up there.	Ilungile phaya phezulu.
I won't, obviously.	Andiyi, ngokucacileyo.
That's right, we know.	Kunjalo, siyazi.
One in front and one in the back.	Enye ngaphambili kwaye enye ngasemva.
You can do it now, and then you have to do it.	Ungayenza ngoku, kwaye ke kufuneka uyenze.
This way, but certainly not in the way.	Ngale ndlela, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngendlela.
I'll talk later.	Ndithetha kamva.
That person will get the answer.	Loo mntu uya kufumana impendulo.
I am a new person here.	Ndingumntu omtsha apha.
He knew it was me.	Wayesazi ukuba ndim.
Weeks at a time.	Iiveki ngexesha.
He used to be with me, in the afternoon.	Wayedla ngokuba nam, emva kwemini.
He went with you.	Uhambe nawe.
I know it's okay.	Ndiyazi ukuba kulungile.
He is only willing.	Uzimisele kuphela.
He would return later today for sure.	Wayeza kubuya kamva namhlanje ngokuqinisekileyo.
I want to think about this.	Ndifuna ukucinga ngale nto.
I said nothing about it.	Andizange ndithethe nto ngayo.
Not too fun for you.	Akukho mnandi kakhulu kuwe.
Or if it is true.	Okanye ukuba yinyani.
Probably any answer at all.	Mhlawumbi nayiphi na impendulo konke konke.
I am all the attention.	Ndim yonke ingqalelo.
I don’t care about it though.	Andikhathali ngayo nangona kunjalo.
What do you think about that.	Ucinga ntoni ngaloo nto.
Everyone wants a picture.	Wonke umntu ufuna umfanekiso.
And maybe even a baby.	Kwaye mhlawumbi nokuba ngumntwana.
It will be so much fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi kangako.
I think it's a mistake.	Ndicinga impazamo.
That will last a lifetime.	Oko kuya kuhlala ubomi bonke.
He did all that.	Uyenzile yonke loo nto.
Very soon what you have to wait for.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu yintoni ekufuneka ulinde kuyo.
He opened his eyes and read.	Wavula amehlo wafunda.
They stay that way for a long time.	Bahlala kanye ngolo hlobo ixesha elide.
He is clearly interested in it.	Unomdla ngokucacileyo ngayo.
Sorry more, maybe.	Uxolo ngakumbi, mhlawumbi.
He would always be with me.	Wayeza kuba nam rhoqo.
And he is completely human.	Kwaye ungumntu ngokupheleleyo.
So, they say.	Ngoko, bathi.
That's what he was talking about.	Yiyo loo nto wayethetha.
He left because he wanted to be alone.	Wemka kuba efuna ukuba yedwa.
He can do that but not too much.	Angayenza loo nto kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I have never seen anyone.	Andizange ndimbone umntu.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala, kudala.
There is no money for him here.	Akukho mali yakhe apha.
Everyone went there.	Wonke umntu waya apho.
And you are not going.	Kwaye awuyi.
You have to look at everything.	Kufuneka ujonge yonke into.
Tell me what's the problem.	Ndixelele yintoni ingxaki.
But he is not good at it.	Kodwa akakho kakuhle kuyo.
Obviously, no one was coming.	Ngokucacileyo, akukho mntu wayeza kuza.
And wrong in a really big way.	Kwaye engalunganga ngendlela enkulu ngokwenene.
All of this is very good for us.	Konke oku kuhle kakhulu kuthi.
He did not need to say more.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba athethe ngakumbi.
You only have to do the work once.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi kube kanye kuphela.
Not much better, but better.	Hayi ngcono kakhulu, kodwa ngcono.
Yes he has gone on his own.	Ewe uye wahamba ngokwakhe.
For now, here.	Okwangoku, apha.
Yes, it happens everywhere.	Ewe, kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
But it will not be new.	Kodwa akuyi kuba yinto entsha.
Not just your house.	Hayi nje indlu yakho.
It will look good.	Kuya kubonakala kulungile.
I hope you get the chance to do the same thing.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kufumana ithuba lokwenza into efanayo.
But the fact is.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba uhambe kancinci kwaye ucinge kakuhle.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu .
Not just you.	Hayi wena kuphela.
It will get better, but it is not necessary.	Kuya kuba ngcono, kodwa akuyomfuneko.
Then he asked for an answer.	Emva koko wacela impendulo.
I don't believe in it.	Andikholelwa kuyo.
I'll be back tonight.	Ndiza kubuya ngokuhlwa.
That's exactly what driving is all about.	Yiloo nto kanye ethetha ngayo ukuqhuba imoto.
Where are you now.	Uphi ngoku.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuhlala kunjalo.
Do not think that it will take everything.	Musa ukucinga ukuba iya kuthatha yonke into.
Well, there is no way we should do it at this time.	Kulungile, akukho ndlela kufuneka senze ngayo ngeli xesha.
You have to stay optimistic.	Kufuneka uhlale unethemba.
Then he would start again.	Emva koko wayeza kuqala kwakhona.
Look early at work.	Jonga kwangethuba emsebenzini.
This will be the case, then.	Oku kuya kuba njalo, ngoko.
You have to wait about.	Kufuneka ulindele malunga.
You have it clearly and you have done it.	Unayo ngokucacileyo kwaye uyenzile.
It does something for you.	Kwenza into kuwe.
But not for us.	Kodwa hayi kuthi.
It has to be very fun.	Kufuneka abe mnandi kakhulu.
I don't know, you don't know.	Andazi, awuyazi.
In fact, it seemed that no one at all.	Ngenene, kwakubonakala ngathi akukho mntu konke konke.
That would be really fun.	Oko bekuya kuba mnandi ngokwenene.
I'm not having fun.	Andikho mnandi.
You've got some.	Uye wafumana ezinye.
So, he looks good.	Ngoko, ukhangeleka kakuhle.
I'm sure you look and will do well.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ujonge kwaye uza kwenza kakuhle.
But to me, he made a lot of money.	Kodwa kum, wenza imali eninzi kakhulu.
To me that's good.	Kum oko kulungile.
That, of course, is a very good thing for you.	Oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, yinto entle kakhulu kuwe.
He knew a little about me.	Wayesazi kancinci ngam.
He looked no further.	Wajonga hayi.
It's hard to do that in a car.	Kunzima ukwenza oko emotweni.
He became a man.	Waba yindoda.
Well, not so for me.	Ewe, akunjalo kum.
And one.	Kwaye omnye.
I never saw it again.	Khange ndiphinde ndibone.
I wanted everything, two for everything.	Ndandifuna yonke into, ezimbini kuyo yonke into.
And no one, of course.	Kwaye akukho mntu, kunjalo.
It would be even harder.	Bekuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
Look at my story.	Jonga ibali lam.
There is no money here.	Akukho mali apha.
I want to do one thing.	Ndifuna ukwenza into enye.
At first, all seemed well.	Ekuqaleni, konke kwakubonakala kulungile.
Soon, perhaps, but for now.	Kungekudala, mhlawumbi, kodwa okwangoku.
All if possible.	Konke ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I will always be here.	Ndiza kuhlala ndilapha rhoqo.
We all know it well.	Sonke siyazi kakuhle.
This is not possible because.	Oku akunakwenzeka ngenxa.
But he asked for help.	Kodwa wacela uncedo.
He did not think it was true.	Akazange acinge ukuba yinyani.
Then we'll see if you exist.	Emva koko siza kubona ukuba ukhona na.
In that case.	Kuloo nto ke.
But it's really hard to see.	Kodwa ngenene kunzima ukubona.
Where are you now???.	Uphi ngoku???.
You have to do what he did !.	Kufuneka wenze lento ayenzileyo!.
There is so much in everything.	Kukho okuninzi kuyo yonke into.
He can't go there.	Akakwazi ukuya apho.
If you really want to just get it.	Ukuba ufuna ngokwenene ukufumana nje.
You will not do this.	Awuyi kuyenza le nto.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba unxibe.
You will really need it.	Kuya kufuneka ngokwenene kuyo.
You eat this regularly and you really like it.	Utya oku rhoqo kwaye uyayithanda ngokwenene.
I haven't done much with it.	Andizange ndenze nto ingako ngaloo nto.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani.
He needs to speak clearly.	Kufuneka athethe ngokucacileyo.
But you are right, you are right.	Kodwa ulungile, ulungile.
It should be good, and it should be better.	Kumele kube kuhle, kwaye kube ngcono.
And it always happened.	Kwaye kwenzeka njalo.
Yeah, except for a little bit.	Ewe, ngaphandle nje kancinci.
I'm very sorry about that.	Ndicela uxolo kakhulu ngalonto.
I just know what you can do.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba uyakwazi ukwenza ntoni.
There he found his money.	Apho wafumana imali yakhe.
Talk about everything.	Ukuthetha ngayo yonke into.
Just like you did last night.	Kanye njengokuba wenze phezolo.
But maybe he won't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akayi.
This time alone.	Ngeli xesha yedwa.
What he wants is for him.	Into ayifunayo nguye.
They say he did.	Bathi wenze njalo.
Yes, that's right now.	Ewe, kunjalo ngoku.
Or I do not know.	Okanye andazi.
I don't want to talk about that.	Andifuni kuthetha ngaloo nto.
Now not well.	Ngoku hayi kakuhle.
That will be difficult.	Oko kuya kuba nzima.
We will try to help you when possible.	Siya kuzama ukukunceda xa kunokwenzeka.
Nobody knows that.	Akukho mntu uyayazi loo nto.
Thank you for being so kind to me.	Enkosi ngokuba ulungile kum ke.
This is not any window.	Le ayisiyiyo nayiphi na ifestile.
He was certainly afraid.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayesoyika.
All of that will happen soon.	Yonke loo nto iza kwenzeka kungekudala.
Except for once.	Ngaphandle kokuba kube kanye.
I just want to know how.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba njani.
But he knew he was there.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba ukhona.
There is no real danger, you know.	Akukho ngozi ngokwenene, uyazi.
He was struggling, though.	Wayenza nzima, nangona kunjalo.
Everyone knows this by now.	Wonke umntu uyayazi le nto ngoku.
I can help you.	Ndiyakwazi ukukunceda.
My mother told me everything.	Umama wam wandixelela yonke into.
You don't have to come all the way, you know.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uze konke, uyazi.
Please come home.	Ndicela uze ekhaya.
What would you like ?.	Ungathanda ntoni ?.
And in a very big way.	Kwaye ngendlela enkulu kakhulu.
And no one spoke to me.	Kwaye akukho mntu uthethe nam.
From tomorrow.	Ukusukela ngomso.
If something has to happen it will definitely happen.	Ukuba kukho into ekufuneka yenzeke ngokuqinisekileyo iya kwenzeka.
No one saw anything bad, of course.	Akukho mntu wabona into embi, kunjalo.
There is no time at all for him.	Akukho xesha konke konke kuye.
He never told her about it.	Zange amxelele ngalonto.
I definitely want to try one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna ukuzama enye.
And in the hospital he never had that.	Kwaye esibhedlele akazange abe nayo loo nto.
But he knew he couldn't.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akanakukwazi.
He did not tell her.	Khange amxelele.
That would be great for me.	Oko bekuya kuba kuhle kum.
I mean, no.	Ndithetha nje, hayi.
So we'll take it.	Ngoko siza kuthatha.
But if you have to do it.	Kodwa ukuba kufuneka wenze njalo.
I mean all.	Ndithetha bonke.
At first, nothing happened.	Ekuqaleni, akuzange kwenzeke nto.
So he will not go.	Ngoko akayi .
He will come back to you.	Uza kubuya eze kuwe.
You have to succeed in order to succeed.	Kufuneka uphumelele ukuze uphumelele.
I think we should go there.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siye phaya.
I want you to have my children.	Ndifuna ube nabantwana bam.
I don't want anything else.	Andifuni enye into.
He wants to be you.	Ufuna kube nguwe lowo.
And that's not for me.	Kwaye akukho kum oko.
And then the case.	Kwaye ke ityala.
No one thought anything but him.	Akukho bani wayecinga nto ngaphandle kwakhe.
Going fast is okay.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza kulungile.
I'm not even sure what it is now.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba yintoni ngoku.
You should be there next week.	Kufuneka ube khona kwiveki ezayo.
Over again .	Kwakhona kwakhona .
There is another place.	Kukho enye indawo.
You told me your story.	Undixelele ibali lakho.
There will always be something bad.	Kuya kuhlala kukho into embi.
I was looking for a job.	Bendifuna umsebenzi.
Unless you know.	Ngaphandle kokuba uyazi.
Everyone wants to do something for themselves.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukwenza into ngokwakhe.
I will be with you soon.	Ndiza kuba nawe kungekudala.
it seemed to us.	kwakubonakala ngathi.
It seems clear now.	Kubonakala kucacile ngoku.
And every year.	Kwaye yonke iminyaka.
It will be under him.	Kuya kuba phantsi kwakhe.
That, of course, is fine.	Oko, kunjalo, kulungile.
It's my bedtime.	Lixesha lam lokulala.
He's just sitting.	Uhleli nje.
I don’t really know what to do at the moment.	Andazi ngenene ukuba ndenze ntoni ngeli xesha.
Good work for everyone.	Umsebenzi omhle ngumntu wonke.
Almost everyone went back to bed.	Phantse wonke umntu wabuyela ebhedini.
It means a lot to come with us.	Kuthetha kakhulu ukuba uze kunye nathi.
My father said no.	Utata wathi hayi.
We want a big car.	Sifuna imoto enkulu.
I want your coat.	Ndifuna idyasi yakho.
The lamp, for sure.	Isibane, ngokuqinisekileyo.
It ended immediately.	Kwaphela ngoko nangoko.
You always want to learn everything.	Ngalo lonke ixesha ufuna ukufunda yonke into.
Or you may want to know more.	Okanye unqwenela ukwazi ngakumbi.
Very yes.	Kakhulu ewe.
He just wants everything.	Ufuna nje yonke into.
We want to help.	Sifuna ukunceda.
He finally thought of a way.	Ekugqibeleni wacinga indlela.
Nobody wants to die.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukufa.
He got better at it.	Waba ngcono kuyo.
But he walked slowly.	Kodwa wahamba kancinci.
Getting to work before someone else.	Ukufika emsebenzini ngaphambi komnye umntu.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga, ukwenza njani oku.
But not better.	Kodwa hayi ngcono.
But that is not always the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo rhoqo.
He seemed to have never heard of it.	Wabonakala engazange weva ngayo.
There was no problem with that.	Kwakungekho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
She had to come to him.	Kwafuneka eze kuye.
He started saying something.	Waqalisa ukuthetha into.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.	Ndizama nje ukwenza into elungileyo.
I, of course, love it.	Mna, kunjalo, ndiyayithanda.
Tomorrow, he would go tomorrow to see the police.	Ngomso, wayeza kuya ngomso, aye kubona amapolisa.
No, it did not.	Hayi, akuzange kwenzeke.
He did not know for how long.	Wayengazi ukuba ixesha elide kangakanani.
So he loves it.	Ngoko uyayithanda.
Help me please!.	Ndincede Nceda!.
He did not want it to be difficult.	Wayengafuni ukuba nzima.
Not too much to buy.	Hayi kakhulu ukuthenga.
And, yes, that's pretty good enough.	Kwaye, ewe, oko kulungile kakhulu ngokwaneleyo.
That, of course, is a good idea.	Ngenene licebo elihle elo.
I'll talk about it to you.	Ndiza kuthetha ngayo kuwe.
But I couldn't figure out what the problem was.	Kodwa andikwazanga ukufumana ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Maybe later, but not now.	Mhlawumbi kamva, kodwa hayi ngoku.
No, no, he wasn't.	Hayi, hayi, wayengekho.
I do not see.	andiboni.
You won’t get another chance until dinner.	Awuyi kufumana elinye ithuba kude kube isidlo sangokuhlwa.
I have to go to school.	Kufuneka ndiye esikolweni.
Now he realized that it was okay.	Ngoku waqonda ukuba kulungile.
You have to go now, though.	Kufuneka uhambe ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
I'd like to do that here, too.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko apha, nam.
It could be a better thing.	Inokuba yinto entle ngakumbi.
Getting it, too.	Ukufumana, kwakhona.
For this place.	Ngokuba le ndawo.
And you are always busy.	Kwaye uhlale uxakekile.
I mean.	Ndithetha nje .
New doctor.	Ugqirha omtsha.
There seems to be no reason.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho sizathu.
You probably know about him.	Usenokuba uyazi ngaye.
And the whole thing is too much.	Kwaye yonke into eninzi kakhulu.
That's fine.	Ulungile ke.
Personally, it is.	Ngokwakhe, kunjalo.
Maybe he doesn't know anyone.	Mhlawumbi akasazi mntu.
You really do a very good job here.	Ngenene wenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu apha.
Because he really left.	Kuba wemka nyani.
You have to be out there.	Kufuneka ube phaya phandle.
But tell me something.	Kodwa ndixelele into.
We want to succeed, and we will succeed.	Sifuna ukuphumelela, kwaye siya kuphumelela.
There is or is to be about.	Kukho okanye kukho malunga.
It will take days.	Kuya kuthatha iintsuku.
I really wanted to do more, you know.	Bendifuna ngokwenene ukwenza ngakumbi, uyazi.
I go, thank you.	Ndiya, enkosi.
I do not know why.	Andazi ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo.
I will try that !.	Ndiza kuzama oko!.
Nowhere but you, he wanted to talk.	Akukho ndawo ngaphandle kwakho, wayefuna ukuthetha.
I wish it had happened more.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kwenzeke ngakumbi.
There is no reason then.	Akukho sizathu ngoko.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo.
I can speak well.	Ndiyakwazi ukuthetha kakuhle.
Then in the house.	Emva koko endlini.
You know this well.	Uyazi kakuhle oku.
And he ate very little.	Kwaye watya kancinci kakhulu.
He really needs help.	Ufuna uncedo ngokwenene.
I'll get one soon.	Ndiza kufumana enye kwangethuba.
I wonder though.	Ndiyazibuza kodwa.
I want to be regular again.	Ndifuna ukuba rhoqo kwakhona.
That's it, it's better.	Yiloo nto, kungcono.
He ate with her.	Wakhe watya naye.
He did a great job in his spare time.	Wenze umsebenzi omhle ngexesha lakhe.
In a good place.	Kwindawo elungileyo.
Not everything, but very much.	Hayi yonke into, kodwa kakhulu.
Really, this is the case.	Ngokwenene, oku kunjalo.
Yes, there are others.	Ewe, kukho abanye.
You like shopping here !.	Uthanda ukuthenga apha!.
Or another time, if you want to, that's fine.	Okanye elinye ixesha, ukuba uyafuna, kulungile.
He asked me questions about my work.	Wandibuza imibuzo ngomsebenzi wam.
There is no need to be too hard on him.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba nzima kakhulu kuye.
We will go far.	Siza kuhamba kude.
I wanted to stop reading.	Ndandifuna ukuyeka ukufunda.
I would love to get one.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukufumana enye.
It's hard to tell at this point.	Kunzima ukuxelela okwangoku.
I can't imagine how.	Andikwazi ukucinga ukuba njani.
You want your money.	Ufuna imali yakho.
I think we want each other the same way.	Ndicinga ukuba sifuna omnye komnye ngendlela efanayo.
And, at first, he was very talkative.	Kwaye, ekuqaleni, wayethetha kakhulu.
But there was no work.	Kodwa kwakungekho msebenzi.
I have never heard anyone do that before.	Andizange ndive nabani na owenza loo nto ngaphambili.
I can't do too much.	Andikwazi ukwenza okuninzi kakhulu.
Then, you did that last night.	Emva koko, uyenzile loo nto phezolo.
People say you look like me.	Abantu bathi ufana nam.
Not just a letter.	Hayi nje ileta.
Just thinking of one thing.	Kuphela ukucinga into enye.
He is really ready to do that.	Ukulungele ngokwenene ukwenza oko.
How smart you are.	Ukrelekrele kangakanani.
I told you my problem.	Ndikuxelele ingxaki yam.
Good job, good car, living alone.	Umsebenzi omhle, imoto entle, ukuhlala ndedwa.
He really lives in my house.	Uhlala nyani endlini yam.
However this is not mandatory.	Nangona kunjalo oku akunyanzelekanga.
I don't want to live in it.	Andifuni ukuhlala kuyo.
Look at our mother.	Jonga umama wethu.
I will not wait.	Andiyi kulinda.
Moreover he thought he would be.	Ngaphezu koko wayecinga ukuba uya kuba njalo.
It is impossible to try to do that.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba uzama ukwenza njalo.
But no, you can't.	Kodwa hayi, awukwazi.
There was nothing he thought it was.	Kwakungekho nto wayecinga ukuba yiyo.
Coming home, staying home.	Ukuza ekhaya, ukuhlala ekhaya.
So, what a big problem.	Ke, yintoni ingxaki enkulu.
I'm sure it will last a long, long time.	Ndiqinisekile iya kuhlala ixesha elide, elide.
He never told me how he knew that.	Akazange andixelele ukuba uyazi njani loo nto.
Tell me why you are so interested in him.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni unomdla kangaka kuye.
Too much space.	Indawo eninzi kakhulu.
That's the way he always does.	Yiloo ndlela ahlala esenza ngayo.
But no one told me it was going to be hard.	Kodwa akukho mntu wandixelela ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
Then he built another one.	Emva koko wakha enye.
I wanted a nice house.	Ndandifuna indlu entle.
He did it here.	Uyenzile apha.
But not for you.	Kodwa hayi kuwe.
But he arrived late.	Kodwa wafika emva kwexesha.
She is OK in bed.	Ulungile ebhedini.
Everyone is looking up.	Wonke umntu ujonge phezulu.
There are children here.	Kukho abantwana apha.
It's better for me.	Kungcono kum.
Yes, that will go well.	Ewe, oko kuya kuhamba kakuhle.
If not, maybe tomorrow night.	Ukuba akunjalo, mhlawumbi ngomso ebusuku.
It is not easy when there are many people.	Akukho lula xa kukho abantu abaninzi.
I knew he would talk to me later.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuthetha nam emva koko.
But it will not last long.	Kodwa akuyi kuhlala ixesha elide.
So he had hope.	Ngoko wayenethemba.
We should not do that.	Akufunekanga senze njalo.
He wants me to do that.	Ufuna ndenze loo nto.
He didn't know much.	Wayengazi nto ingako.
But we both went.	Kodwa siye sobabini.
Or anyone who wants peace.	Okanye nabani na ofuna uxolo.
Soon, but not now.	Kungekudala, kodwa hayi ngoku.
He has gone his way.	Uye wahamba indlela yakhe.
But he seems to be just like us.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi ufana nathi.
We'll talk about this again soon.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto kwakhona kungekudala.
And death is real.	Kwaye ukufa ngokwenene.
So it seemed to me.	Ngoko kwakubonakala kum.
For it is time.	Ngokuba lixesha.
He always walks.	Uhlala uhamba.
Immediately.	Kwangoko nangoko .
And you seem to be here.	Kwaye ubonakala ulapha.
You did all this.	Nguwe owenze yonke le nto.
You, however, are fine.	Wena, nangona kunjalo, ulungile.
But not just one.	Kodwa hayi enye kuphela.
It's time for someone to act.	Lixesha lokuba umntu enze.
I don't want a problem.	Andifuni ngxaki.
I have to tell you something.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele enye into.
You know, yes and no.	Uyazi, ewe kwaye hayi.
And no one was going to talk about it.	Kwaye akukho mntu wayeza kuthetha ngayo.
I will be alone again.	Ndiza kuba ndedwa kwakhona.
I never thought they would have such a thing.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba baya kuba nayo into enjalo.
That would mean staying home.	Oko bekuya kuthetha ukuhlala ekhaya.
I'm trying to find peace.	Ndizama ukufumana uxolo.
His eyes go far away.	Amehlo akhe aye kude.
Everything is so beautiful.	Yinto entle kakhulu yonke into.
Well, it has to be.	Kulungile, kufuneka kube njalo.
You did well there.	Wenze kakuhle ke apho.
Maybe soon, maybe later.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala, mhlawumbi kamva.
I know it will be so much fun !.	Ndiyazi ukuba iya kuba mnandi kakhulu!.
I made a small mistake.	Ndenze impazamo encinci.
He is completely human.	Ungumntu ngokupheleleyo.
There is this, though.	Kukho oku, nangona kunjalo.
I don't know anything about it right now.	Andazi nto ngayo ngoku.
But not yesterday.	Kodwa hayi izolo.
Small meat.	Inyama encinci.
Very nice inside.	Kuhle kakhulu ngaphakathi.
I want to be as beautiful as you.	Ndifuna ukuba mhle njengawe.
Me, now alone in bed.	Mna, ngoku ndedwa ebhedini.
My real mother.	Umama wam nyani.
Okay, okay, but not too much.	Kulungile, kulungile, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Maybe it will come later.	Mhlawumbi iya kufika kamva.
Look at me!!.	Ndijonge!!.
Would you like to be the first one?	Ngaba ungathanda ukuba ngowokuqala?
You think about it all the time.	Ucinga ngayo rhoqo.
You will know when you are ready.	Uya kukwazi xa ulungile.
Sorry.	Uxolo wethu.
However, I do not know how to do this.	Nangona kunjalo, andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani le nto.
We'll see how lucky you are.	Siza kubona ukuba unethamsanqa kangakanani.
Unless you're lucky.	Ngaphandle kokuba unethamsanqa oko.
Don't do no.	Musa ukwenza musa.
But not in it.	Kodwa hayi kuyo.
I wait and wait and wait.	Ndilinde ndilinde kwaye ndilinde.
They will demand a lot of money from it.	Baza kufuna imali eninzi ngayo.
For clearly it is not.	Kuba ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I don't really know how to do that.	Andazi ngenene ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Or stay here.	Okanye ukuhlala apha.
He is now retired.	Lo ngoku udla umhlala-phantsi.
I tried to think of something else.	Ndazama ukucinga ngenye into.
I don't see anyone at first.	Andiboni mntu ekuqaleni.
You just want to be a kid again.	Ufuna nje ukuba ngumntwana kwakhona.
You do not think of anything else.	Awucingi enye into.
John came out.	UJohn waphuma.
You have to look forward and look forward.	Kufuneka ujonge phambili kwaye ujonge phambili.
One of yours, too.	Enye yakho, nawe.
They are both my son.	Bobabini unyana wam.
Maybe you've slept.	Mhlawumbi ukhe walala.
That never happened.	Andizange yenzeke loo nto.
You had to leave quickly to succeed.	Kwafuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza ukuze uphumelele.
I sit here looking at my side.	Ndihlala apha ndijonge ecaleni kwam.
It would be fun.	Bekuya kuba mnandi .
You want to say that.	Ufuna ukuyithetha loo nto.
What everyone knew.	Oko wonke umntu wayesazi.
A few days you have to do it.	Iintsuku ezimbalwa kufuneka uyenze.
This one looks very much like that.	Lo ukhangeleka kakhulu ukuba.
You can have anything.	Usenokuba nantoni na.
And some of his friends.	Kwaye abanye abahlobo bakhe.
Tomorrow, if possible.	Ngomso, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He said he was ready to die.	Wathi ukulungele ukufa.
His name again.	Igama lakhe kwakhona.
His mother but.	Umama wakhe kodwa.
Traveling is not so easy.	Ukuhamba akukho lula kangako.
Not much space.	Akukho ndawo ingako.
And children.	Kunye nabantwana.
He thought he should know.	Wayecinga ukuba ufanele ukuba uyazi.
I'm looking at it now.	Ndijonge kuyo ngoku.
Not just without you.	Akunjalo nje ngaphandle kwakho.
That would be a very unusual thing to do.	Oko kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu ukuyenza.
Wherever you are.	Nokuba uphi.
And he never made a mistake.	Kwaye akazange enze impazamo.
Of course he knew nothing about his being there.	Ewe wayengazi nto ngokuba kwakhe apho.
They go where we go.	Baya apho siya khona.
Yes, not far away.	Ewe, hayi kude.
And then we had to do, and do it now.	Kwaye ke kwafuneka ukuba senze, kwaye senze ngoku.
If you want to meet me at it.	Ukuba ufuna ukudibana nam kuyo.
And everyone knows this.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
Or a restaurant.	Okanye indawo yokutyela.
He does all of this on his own.	Yonke le nto uyenza yedwa.
That's a good thing probably.	Yinto entle leyo mhlawumbi.
Nothing, either.	Akukho nto, nayo.
No one will ever know you are here.	Akukho mntu uya kukwazi ukuba ulapha.
Maybe he had to go.	Mhlawumbi kwafuneka ahambe.
I knew only one thing.	Ndandisazi into enye kuphela.
When he gets somewhere.	Xa efika kwindawo ethile.
We don't have to do anything.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba senze nantoni na.
There was no reason for him to enter.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba angene.
But not at all.	Kodwa hayi kuyo yonke loo nto.
And now what.	Kwaye ngoku yintoni.
Or he did not want to talk.	Okanye wayengafuni kuthetha.
There was no question.	Kwakungekho mbuzo.
I've never had that problem before.	Andizange ndize naloo ngxaki ngaphambili.
I don't remember feeling very well myself.	Andikhumbuli ndiziva kakhulu mna.
His father probably came out.	Inokuba utata wakhe waphuma.
Clearly he did not do a very good job.	Ngokucacileyo akenzanga umsebenzi omhle kakhulu.
You have a big problem.	Unengxaki enkulu.
We just want to get out and do some work.	Sifuna nje ukuphuma senze umsebenzi.
If you don't want to be with me, tell me.	Ukuba awufuni ukuba nam, ndixelele.
She says she loves him.	Uthi uyamthanda.
But again, it has to be done.	Kodwa kwakhona, kufuneka yenziwe.
The truth about what is going on.	Inyaniso malunga nokuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Or in the afternoon, for that matter.	Okanye emva kwemini, ngaloo nto.
See what you want.	Jonga ukuba ufuna ntoni.
Certainly you can.	Ngokuqinisekileyo unokuba njalo.
That sounds good, though.	Oko kubonakala kulungile, nangona kunjalo.
Just to talk a little bit about it.	Ukuthetha nje kancinci ngayo.
Better to make it easier for me.	Kungcono ukwenza kube lula kum.
But money.	Kodwa imali.
I brought it home.	Ndize nayo ekhaya.
But you don't really want to.	Kodwa awufuni ngokwenene.
And it won't take much.	Kwaye akuyi kuthatha kakhulu.
Everyone wanted to work there.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukusebenza apho.
If you read this, you know.	Ukuba ufunda oku, uyazi.
Not for you, not me.	Hayi ngawe, hayi mna.
You really shouldn’t, but look further.	Akufanele ngokwenene, kodwa ujonge ngakumbi.
My mother did, and she asked me to do it.	Umama wenza, kwaye wandicela ukuba ndiyenze.
This is more difficult than it seems.	Oku kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba kubonakala.
Eventually he would make room.	Ekugqibeleni wayeza kwenza indawo.
They did not all go there together.	Abazange baye apho bonke kunye.
Yes, the answer is correct.	Ewe, impendulo ilungile.
I'm going to talk about that now.	Ndiza kuthetha ngaloo nto ngoku.
No one came to his room at night.	Kwakungekho mntu uza kwigumbi lakhe ebusuku.
There is a small problem here.	Kukho ingxaki encinci apha.
And we know how hard it will be.	Kwaye siyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangakanani.
I heard a voice.	Ndeva ilizwi.
It is his job to help you succeed.	Ngumsebenzi wakhe ukukunceda uphumelele.
You do not have to graduate from college.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube uphumelele ekholejini.
Don't come.	Musa ukuza.
But he can't speak.	Kodwa akakwazi kuthetha.
But there was no one, she realized.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu, waqonda.
Both in the house.	Bobabini endlini.
The dog is fine.	Inja ilungile.
Getting there can be easy.	Ukuya apho kunokuba lula.
That is good for him.	Ilungile loo nto kuye.
But not for that long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide kangako.
I hope you think so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ucinga njalo.
I am not at all.	Andikho tu kwaphela.
You play with it.	Udlala ngayo.
There is no reason for him to do so.	Akukho sizathu sokuba enjenjalo.
That's what needs to be done.	Nantso into ekufuneka yenziwe.
It's too far away.	Kude kakhulu phaya.
That's my problem here.	Nantso ingxaki yam apha.
Do nothing about it.	Musa ukwenza nto ngayo.
It is better to be away from him.	Kungcono ukuba kude naye.
And it wasn’t too much.	Kwaye kwakungekho kakhulu.
And your phone.	Kwaye ifowuni yakho.
Just as you want to do.	Kanye njengoko ufuna ukwenza.
I knew what it was.	Ndandisazi ukuba yintoni na.
So you can do it here.	Ngoko ungayenza apha.
He looked away from her immediately.	Wajonga kude kuye ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe after you leave.	Mhlawumbi emva kokuba uhambe.
We do not have to go all the way.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba sihambe yonke indlela.
Let me see friends.	Makhe ndibone abahlobo.
This is fine though.	Oku kulungile nangona kunjalo.
This happened to him.	Oku kwenzeka kuye.
I had to do it a little bit.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze kancinci loo nto.
There is something to be done about it.	Kukho into ekufuneka yenziwe ngayo.
But it will be a big deal.	Kodwa uya kuba yinto enkulu.
But it is better this way.	Kodwa kungcono ngale ndlela.
Can he do it?	Ngaba angayenza?
Moreover, he is intelligent.	Ngaphezu koko ukrelekrele.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba sihambe kwakhona.
And this is going to be really hard.	Kwaye oku kuya kuba nzima ngokwenene.
It has to be now.	Kumele kube ngoku.
It's not me at all.	Ayindim kwaphela.
He felt it.	Waziva ngayo.
He did, absolutely.	Wenza, ngokupheleleyo.
But we did well.	Kodwa senze kakuhle.
Nothing and no one is going to him.	Akukho nto kwaye akukho mntu uya kuye.
Not my parents.	Hayi abazali bam.
I do not have the same answer.	Andinayo impendulo efanayo.
You must be kidding me.	Ufanele ukuba udlala ngam.
I had never seen him like that before.	Andizange ndimbone ngolo hlobo ngaphambili.
I really wanted to do that.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza loo nto.
He did not want to do this again.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza le nto kwakhona.
Everything comes quickly.	Yonke into iza ngokukhawuleza.
He almost died many times.	Uphantse wafa izihlandlo ezininzi.
That will not be necessary.	Oko akuyi kufuneka.
I don't want anyone but you.	Andifuni mntu ngaphandle kwakho.
Just as you told me.	Kanye njengoko undixelele.
Just making it harder.	Ukwenza nje kube nzima.
Yeah, to him, lately.	Ewe, kuye, mva nje.
You will need to know everything about her by now.	Kuya kufuneka wazi yonke into ngaye okwangoku.
As you walk, look up.	Njengoko uhamba, jonga phezulu.
He hoped that there was no need for him to do so.	Wayenethemba lokuba akukho mfuneko yokuba enjenjalo.
They will tell him later.	Baza kumxelela kamva.
As it is.	Njengoko kunjalo.
For now he would just like to stay.	Okwangoku angathanda nje ukuhlala.
I have seen things my way.	Ndibone izinto ngendlela yam.
Man does not want, it seems he wants something else.	Umntu akafuni, kubonakala ngathi ufuna enye into.
But everyone says no, no, never.	Kodwa wonke umntu uthi hayi, hayi, soze.
Not so, not now.	Hayi ngoko, hayi ngoku.
Then, this time more powerful.	Emva koko, ngeli xesha ngamandla ngakumbi.
You've already done it.	Sele uyenzile njalo.
Man then has a problem.	Umntu ke ngoko unengxaki.
And little by little.	Kwaye kancinci kancinci.
And certainly thinking.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ukucinga.
I went there now.	Ndaya apho ke ngoku.
I did well with it.	Ndenze kakuhle ngayo.
Someone may have done just that.	Umntu usenokuba wenze kanye loo nto.
Everyone is interested.	Wonke umntu unomdla.
That's all weird.	Yiyo yonke into engaqhelekanga.
Whether this actually happened or not she does not know.	Ukuba oku kwenzeka ngokwenene okanye akunjalo akazi.
I wanted to help us.	Ndandifuna ukusinceda.
Staying optimistic.	Ukuhlala unethemba.
I can't really talk about this here.	Andikwazi nyani ukuthetha ngale nto apha.
I think there is something wrong with you.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngawe.
To me, that's fine.	Kum, oko kulungile.
And that inside him.	Kwaye ukuba ngaphakathi kuye.
Now your friends.	Ngoku abahlobo bakho.
I want to help you as much as possible.	Ndifuna ukukunceda kangangoko.
But that is not the only way.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo kuphela indlela.
No one talked about money.	Akukho mntu uthethe ngemali.
But now, she looks so good.	Kodwa ngoku, ukhangeleka kakhulu.
But only in a positive way.	Kodwa kuphela ngendlela elungileyo.
And it happened there.	Kwaye kwenzeka apho.
I just wanted to do something.	Ndandifuna nje ukwenza into.
Then he went to work.	Emva koko wahamba waya emsebenzini.
Everything about it is fine.	Yonke into malunga nayo ilungile.
But you are the only one without me.	Kodwa nawe kuphela ngaphandle kwam.
I want to go there.	Ndifuna ukuya khona.
Everything else you do well.	Yonke enye into uyenza kakuhle.
I would like to think that.	Ndingathanda ukucinga oko.
Stop searching.	Yeka ukucinga.
However, we know one thing.	Nangona kunjalo, siyazi into enye.
He has said something strange.	Uye wathetha enye into engaqhelekanga.
Look at us all.	Jonga kuthi sonke.
He stays in the hospital for a long time.	Uhlala ixesha elide esibhedlele.
He will just be.	Uya kuba nje.
I can't wait to go to work tomorrow.	Andikwazi kulinda ukuya emsebenzini ngomso.
And time.	Kwaye ixesha.
Then there is no need to make a new one.	Emva koko akukho mfuneko yokwenza entsha.
Maybe he should stay.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka ahlale.
He said, yes, that's right.	Wathi, ewe, kunjalo.
Yes that would be great fun.	Ewe oko kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu.
I love what he did.	Ndiyayithanda into ayenzileyo.
He knows everything that happens.	Uyazi kuyo yonke into eyenzekayo.
Then he really wanted me to sit down.	Emva koko wayefuna ngokwenene ukuba ndihlale phantsi.
He said it was hard to wait.	Wathi kunzima ukulinda.
Then he arrived.	Uye wafika ke.
It will make it a lot easier.	Kuya kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
I will continue that way.	Ndiza kuqhubeka ngaloo ndlela.
He took the gun.	Wathatha umpu.
There are one or two out.	Kukho enye okanye ezimbini ngaphandle.
You want to get this right.	Ufuna ukufumana oku kulungile.
Only nothing.	Akukho nto kuphela.
But if necessary.	Kodwa ukuba kufuneka.
We both know why.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni.
He may not want to.	Usenokuba akafuni.
I really am a great person.	Ngenene ndingumntu omkhulu.
Long time no see, really.	Kudala ndiyazi, ngokwenene.
He told me many things.	Wandixelela izinto ezininzi.
Not right now.	Hayi kanye ngoku.
And it wasn’t much at all.	Kwaye kwakungekho kakhulu konke konke.
I wanted you for me.	Bendifuna wena ngam.
No one came.	Akukho mntu uze.
And since you are reading this, it probably is.	Kwaye ekubeni ufunda oku, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
And where you go.	Kwaye apho uya khona.
I don't know more about it.	Andazi ngakumbi ngayo.
I would like to do this for you.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oku kuwe.
And then he came to us.	Kwaye ke weza kuthi.
You must be reading my mind.	Umele ukuba ufunda ingqondo yam.
And it will take a lot of thought.	Kwaye kuya kufuna ukucinga kakhulu.
But now I want to do things again.	Kodwa ngoku ndifuna ukwenza izinto kwakhona.
I will always be here for you.	Ndiya kuhlala ndilapha ngenxa yakho.
It was not up to him to do otherwise.	Kwakungekho kuye ukwenza ngenye indlela.
He can't stay out here for long.	Akanakukwazi ukuhlala apha ngaphandle ixesha elide.
That's a good thing, not a bad thing.	Yinto entle leyo, hayi embi.
Maybe you think you love him.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba uyamthanda.
He really wanted to do the right thing.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukwenza into elungileyo.
I know you are retiring.	Ndiyazi ukuba udla umhlala-phantsi.
Tell the woman, no more.	Ndixelele umfazi, hayi ngakumbi.
That would take time.	Oko bekuya kuthatha ixesha.
The answer is no.	Impendulo kukuba akunjalo.
No one has ever looked at it.	Akukho mntu wakha wajonga kuyo.
Or another woman.	Okanye omnye umfazi.
But not too long ago.	Kodwa hayi mva nje.
What needs to be done needs to be done.	Into ekufuneka yenziwe kufuneka yenziwe.
And of course everyone knew about it before it happened.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo wonke umntu wayesazi malunga nayo ngaphambi kokuba yenzeke.
But she could not wait that long.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukulinda ixesha elide kangako.
Therefore, it is not possible.	Ngoko ke, akunakwenzeka.
But he had to do it.	Kodwa kwafuneka ayenze.
This is difficult, if not impossible.	Oku kunzima, ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I want to know everything.	Ndifuna ukwazi konke.
I don't understand why this should be the case.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni le nto kufuneka kube njalo.
He did !.	Uye wenza!.
Right there in front of me.	Kanye apho phambi kwam.
Everyone wants to! 	Wonke umntu ufuna!
I couldn't be with him.	Andikwazanga ukuba naye.
She is a beautiful woman.	Umfazi mhle nje.
One day he decided to stop playing.	Ngenye imini wagqiba kwelokuba ayeke ukudlala.
People live at home.	Abantu bahlala ekhaya.
Then you will be able to do other things.	Emva koko uya kukwazi ukwenza ezinye izinto.
No one lived alone.	Akukho namnye wahlala yedwa.
And you never knew when it would be.	Kwaye awuzange wazi ukuba iya kuba nini.
You always want it.	Uhlala ufuna njalo.
Yes, women.	Ewe, akazi.
One cannot control oneself.	Umntu akanakukwazi ukuzibamba.
But if something happens to him.	Kodwa ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuye .
He looked away for sure.	Wajonga ecaleni ngokuqinisekileyo.
I am not alone here.	Andikho ndedwa apha.
Without him, there was no story.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kwakungekho ibali.
You will get immediate attention from me.	Uya kufumana ingqalelo ngokukhawuleza kum.
Maybe you have experienced something like this.	Mhlawumbi ukhe wafumana into enje.
I had no idea you did this.	Bendingayazi ukuba uyenzile lento.
Maybe he was not thinking clearly.	Mhlawumbi wayengacingi kakuhle.
It's too long now.	Mde ngoku.
He asked me to go to him.	Uye wandicela ukuba ndiye kuye.
Some people live and live.	Abanye abantu bahlala kwaye bahlala.
But not easy.	Kodwa hayi lula.
Sorry you will not make your place.	Uxolo awuyi kuyenza indawo yakho.
No one comes or goes.	Akukho mntu uze okanye uhambe.
Dad was very angry.	UTata waba nomsindo ngokwenene.
But then a lot of people.	Kodwa ke abantu abaninzi.
My letter at the end.	Ileta yam ekugqibeleni.
Whatever you do to it.	Nokuba wenze ntoni na kuyo.
As he wanted.	Njengoko wayefuna.
It is very difficult though.	Kunzima kakhulu nangona kunjalo.
You have to do things.	Kufuneka wenze izinto.
He stays there and reads a book.	Uhlala apho kwaye afunde incwadi.
He didn't want to know, not really.	Wayengafuni ukwazi, hayi ngokwenene.
How do you do .	Wenza njani .
Maybe you are tired.	Mhlawumbi udiniwe.
Tell people that.	Xelela abantu oko.
Then this happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka oku.
I just thought you would like to know.	Ndicinge nje ukuba ungathanda ukwazi.
Soon he was in a much better place.	Kungekudala waba kwindawo engcono kakhulu.
I am always here for you.	Ndihlala ndilapha ngenxa yakho.
How how not something.	Njani njani hayi into.
Death alone, as well.	Ukufa yedwa, kunye.
It will take time though.	Kuza kuthatha ixesha kodwa.
But it will definitely come back.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo iya kubuya.
He gave the people money.	Wanika abantu imali.
He never said that again.	Akazange aphinde athethe ngolo hlobo.
Not so much one.	Hayi kakhulu enye.
We'll see how long you stay.	Siza kubona ukuba uhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Many parents.	Abazali abaninzi.
He thought he did.	Wayecinga ukuba wenze njalo.
But this is not just about you.	Kodwa oku akukho malunga nawe kuphela.
He took his lamp and went in.	Wathatha isibane sakhe wangena.
You came to talk to me last night.	Uze kuthetha nam phezolo.
Will it get better? 	Ngaba kuya kuba ngcono?
I don't see it there.	Andiboni apho.
I will be out as long as possible.	Ndiya kuba ngaphandle nje ukuba kunokwenzeka.
We want one.	Sifuna enye.
He will always need help.	Uya kuhlala efuna uncedo.
Two or three days at a time.	Iintsuku ezimbini okanye ezintathu ngexesha.
This means that something is wrong.	Oku kuthetha ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
You have to make a decision now.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo ngoku.
I can't tell you more now.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ngakumbi ngoku.
But another week.	Kodwa enye iveki .
Don't get one.	Musa ukufumana enye.
He did this to her.	Wenze oku kuye.
My mother knew exactly what it was.	Umama wayesazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
We want to talk to you.	Sifuna ukuthetha nawe.
You are so much better, thank you.	Ungcono kakhulu, enkosi.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangakanani.
Dad says something else.	Utata uthetha enye into.
And he doesn't have to know.	Kwaye akufuneki ukuba azi.
That is not what he was talking about.	Ayisiyiyo le nto wayethetha ngayo.
I just want my time with you.	Ndifuna nje ixesha lam nawe.
So everything is everywhere.	Ngoko konke kukho yonke indawo.
I do not want coffee.	Andifuni ikofu.
Or buy one.	Okanye uthenge enye.
I'm not sure if there is another way.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho enye indlela.
He died shortly thereafter.	Wafa ngokukhawuleza emva koko.
That is how we know.	Siyazi ngaloo ndlela ke.
It takes time, obviously.	Kuthatha ixesha, ngokucacileyo.
Then it will be so.	Emva koko kuya kuba njalo.
Not for you.	Akukho kuwe.
I don't really know about this.	Andazi ngenene ngale nto.
This goes all the way up.	Oku kuhamba yonke indlela ukuya phezulu.
But thank you for that.	Kodwa enkosi ngaloo nto.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
No, there he is.	Hayi, nantso wahlala.
You know this and you always have it.	Uyayazi le nto kwaye uhlala unayo.
And he does it that way.	Kwaye uyenza ngendlela.
I know he is determined.	Ndiyamazi uzimisele.
Now we will know.	Ngoku siza kukwazi.
Soon you will be better.	Kungekudala uzakuba ngcono.
But we do not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba siyenze loo nto.
We don't have to do all that.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba siyenze yonke loo nto.
Yes, she is well dressed.	Ewe, unxibe kakuhle.
It’s time, and you know it.	Lixesha, kwaye uyazi.
I can't tell you about myself.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela ngam.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukwenza.
And there is no danger.	Kwaye akukho ngozi.
He should not leave.	Akufunekanga ahambe.
I apologize for doing this to you.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokwenza lento kuwe.
I do not see anything.	Andiboni kwanto.
There is so much more.	Kukho okuninzi kakhulu.
So the question.	Ngoko umbuzo.
He got the same answer.	Wafumana impendulo efanayo.
You better go now.	Kungcono ukuba uhambe ngoku.
He knew better now.	Wayesazi ngcono ngoku.
We are coming here for help.	Siya apha ukufumana uncedo.
I was thinking about us.	Bendicinga ngathi.
You don't have to be human without yourself.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ube ngumntu ngaphandle kwakho.
Look inside the bedroom.	Jonga ngaphakathi kwigumbi lokulala.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi inokuba njalo.
They will want to know.	Baya kufuna ukwazi.
That's all better for you.	Oko konke kungcono kuwe.
I would like to stay there again.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apho kwakhona.
You can't work with everyone everywhere.	Awukwazi ukusebenza naye wonke umntu kuyo yonke indawo.
If so, you.	Ukuba kunjalo, wena.
Also, it has been good to work with you.	Kwakhona, kube kuhle ukusebenza nawe.
After that.	Emva kokuba akukho.
Well, no, enough.	Ewe, hayi, ngokwaneleyo.
We know they live with us.	Siyazi ukuba bahlala nathi.
So you will have to do some more.	Ngoko kuya kufuneka wenze ezinye.
She told her parents, she told her daughter.	Waxelela abazali bakhe, waxelela intombi yakhe.
I want to see the children.	Ndifuna ukubona abantwana.
I went looking for a job.	Ndaya kufuna umsebenzi.
Or where they live now.	Okanye apho ahlala khona ngoku.
I think it would be great, though.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba kuhle, nangona kunjalo.
And you really don't have to.	Kwaye akufuneki ngokwenene.
But he said enough.	Kodwa uthe ngokwaneleyo.
In this, it did not.	Kule, ayizange.
My father goes with me.	Utata uhamba nam.
That would be even more fun.	Oko bekuya kuba mnandi ngakumbi.
But no one says.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthi.
You have to keep learning something new.	Kufuneka uhlale ufunda into entsha.
And no one is in the office.	Kwaye akukho mntu eofisini.
Who is his father ?.	Ngubani utata wakhe?.
You will not be as you are now.	Awuyi kuba njengoko unjalo ngoku.
But with power.	Kodwa ngamandla.
No, of course not.	Akunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Because of me, because of you.	Ngenxa yam, ngenxa yakho.
It was clear he did not want to.	Kwakucacile ukuba wayengafuni.
Almost everyone is smart.	Ukrelekrele phantse wonke umntu.
It's time for something new.	Lixesha lento entsha.
There is nothing I can do after that.	Akukho nto ndingayenza emva koko.
Soon, you will be able to play.	Kungekudala, uya kukwazi ukudlala.
I will not keep silent.	Andiyi kuthi tu.
You always talk to yourself.	Usoloko uthetha wedwa.
He wants to come home.	Ufuna ukuza ekhaya.
He is not with us.	Akakho kuthi.
It makes it very difficult to see.	Kwenza kube nzima kakhulu ukubona.
I'm sorry this is too late.	Ndiyaxolisa ukuba oku kuza emva kwexesha.
Then he left again.	Emva koko wemka kwakhona.
John loves coffee.	UJohn uyayithanda ikofu.
He told me as much as he could.	Wandixelela kangangoko.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko, ilungile.
I thought about it all night.	Ndacinga ngayo ubusuku bonke.
I can do it.	Ndingayenza.
Everyone now knows.	Wonke umntu ngoku uyazi.
And maybe it's me or everything else.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ndim okanye yonke enye into.
But it's good.	Kodwa kuhle.
I know it too.	Nam ndiyayazi.
No, but it's hard.	Akunjalo, kodwa kunzima.
The mind is everything.	Ingqondo yinto yonke.
No, this way.	Hayi, ngale ndlela.
I have to tell her something.	Kufuneka ndimxelele into.
He would do his best.	Wayeza kwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I may be thinking about it a lot.	Inokuba ndicinga ngayo kakhulu.
I just go to work.	Ndiya emsebenzini nje.
There is just something about him.	Kukho into nje ngaye.
He decided that it looked good.	Wagqiba kwelokuba kubonakala kulungile.
I want it very quickly.	Ndifuna kakhulu ngokukhawuleza.
And we'll see how.	Kwaye siza kubona ukuba njani.
That's money.	Nantso imali.
However, it is the same thing again.	Nangona kunjalo, yinto enye kwakhona.
Yes, he needed help.	Ewe, wayefuna uncedo.
You mean everything to me.	Uthetha yonke into kum.
You can't get one without the other.	Awukwazi ukufumana enye ngaphandle komnye.
Going would do it, all the time.	Ukuhamba bekuya kuyenza, ngalo lonke ixesha.
Maybe I don’t care about you.	Mhlawumbi andikhathali ngawe.
Back to me now.	Emva kwam ngoku.
That can be a big deal.	Oko kunokuba yinto enkulu.
This makes it very difficult to drive.	Oku kwenza kube nzima kakhulu ukuqhuba.
Sorry, we'll have to go.	Uxolo, kuza kufuneka sihambe.
Your mother, though.	Umama wakho, nangona.
We will get help.	Siza kufumana uncedo.
That is the only thing that happens most of the time.	Yiloo nto kuphela eyenzekayo ixesha elininzi.
Then it is ready.	Emva koko ilungile.
But now there was nobody there.	Kodwa ngoku kwakungekho mntu.
Again, of course.	Kwakhona, kunjalo nje.
He has arrived.	Uye wafika.
But don't just go.	Kodwa musa ukuya nje.
I know otherwise.	Ndiyazi ngenye indlela.
What happens, of course.	Kwenzeka ntoni, kunjalo.
I will tell him that when he says anything to me.	Ndiza kumxelela ukuba xa ethetha nantoni na kum.
He wants to do it.	Ufuna ukuyenza.
And so, nothing happened.	Kwaye ke, akukho nto yenzekileyo.
This person should stop.	Lo mntu kufuneka ayeke.
You can't, but we know.	Awukwazi, kodwa siyazi.
I wanted you to take a look.	Bendifuna ujonge.
That takes something.	Oko kuthatha into.
I would like to learn from you.	Ndingathanda ukufunda kuwe.
Then he did.	Emva koko wenza njalo.
And now it's you and me.	Ke ngoku nguwe kunye nam.
Too much coffee.	Ikofu eninzi kakhulu.
We know it will be difficult.	Siyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
We will start tomorrow.	Siza kuqala kuqala ngomso.
I didn't have to think about it.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ndicinge ngayo.
Yeah, it's hard to tell, really.	Ewe, kunzima ukuxelela, ngokwenene.
You know you really want to go.	Uyazi ukuba ngokwenene ufuna ukuhamba.
Everyone is happy.	Wonke umntu uyavuya.
It's hard to do things.	Kunzima ukwenza izinto.
It makes working even more fun.	Kwenza ukuba ukusebenza kube mnandi ngakumbi.
So do not overdo things.	Ngoko musa ukwenza nzima kakhulu izinto.
I thought you wanted to be with me.	Bendicinga ukuba ufuna ukuba nam.
He told her, too.	Wamxelela, naye.
But now we need your help.	Kodwa ngoku sifuna uncedo lwakho.
It seems we have been doing this for a long time.	Kubonakala ngathi kudala senze le nto.
She is scared and alone and very young.	Uyoyika kwaye yedwa kwaye encinci kakhulu.
I mean a good person.	Ndithetha umntu olungileyo.
You will find what comes to you.	Uya kufumana oko kuza kuwe.
It will be down.	Kuya kuba phantsi.
I'm not so sure about myself.	Andiqinisekanga kangako ngam.
She ran to me.	Uye wabaleka wangena kum.
I doubt it, he thought.	Ndiyathandabuza, wacinga.
Look at that.	Ujonge loo nto.
I did nothing without him.	Andizange ndenze nto ngaphandle kwakhe.
He did not want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngaye.
This is far.	Oku kude.
But, there is a problem.	Kodwa, kukho ingxaki.
Or he asked.	Okanye wabuza.
Probably not so much, though.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
Probably not all the time.	Mhlawumbi hayi lonke ixesha.
You should have it, too.	Ufanele ukuba nayo, naye.
Maybe this, maybe this.	Mhlawumbi oku, mhlawumbi oku.
Yes, there is money in it when you are lucky.	Ewe, kukho imali kuyo xa unethamsanqa.
And that can only be a big deal.	Kwaye oko kunokuba yinto enkulu kuphela.
I did that with everything.	Ndenze oko ngayo yonke into.
Not a story.	Hayi ibali.
Do not do your homework.	Musa ukwenza umsebenzi wasekhaya.
He also knew what it would be like.	Kwakhona wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba yintoni na.
Another two weeks.	Ezinye iiveki ezimbini.
And they will be right there in the back.	Kwaye baya kuba kanye kuloo mva.
And every day there is music.	Kwaye yonke imihla kukho umculo.
He hoped he would have more time.	Wayenethemba lokuba uza kuba nexesha elingakumbi.
You will get one.	Uya kufumana enye.
To me, there was nothing at the time.	Kum, kwakungekho nto ngelo xesha.
Well, maybe a little bit.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi kancinci.
Yes, everyone.	Ewe, bonke abantu.
He thought something was wrong.	Wacinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
But he said nothing, he did not agree.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto, akazange avume.
And it's not that far down, either.	Kwaye akukho kude kangako phantsi, nokuba.
Probably very difficult.	Mhlawumbi kunzima kakhulu.
There are many things in it.	Kuyo kukho izinto ezininzi.
There was no going that way.	Kwakungekho kuhamba ngaloo ndlela.
Again, not your fault.	Kwakhona, hayi ityala lakho.
This makes you human.	Oku kukwenza ube ngumntu.
I know you will be angry.	Ndiyazi uzakuba nomsindo.
I went there first.	Ndaya khona kuqala.
Today he does.	Namhlanje uyayenza.
Yes, this is very good.	Ewe, oku kuhle kakhulu.
We'll get to that.	Siza kuza kuloo nto.
He really meant a lot.	Ngokwenene wayethetha kakhulu.
Just once, he came.	Kanye nje, uye weza.
Whatever you come up with.	Nantoni na oza nayo.
He tried to get out of bed.	Wazama ukuphuma ebhedini.
Tomorrow when you sleep.	Ngomso xa ulele.
I know it all now.	Ndiyazi konke ngoku.
I will do better tomorrow.	Ndiza kwenza ngcono ngomso.
He never said anything before, never said anything after that.	Akazange athethe nto ngaphambili, akazange athethe nto emva koko.
Not for me, thank you.	Hayi kum, enkosi.
But that would be easy.	Kodwa oko bekuya kuba lula.
And everyone was talking about me.	Kwaye wonke umntu wayethetha ngam.
Doing everything for you.	Ukwenza yonke into ngawe.
I did not have any money.	Andizange ndibe nayo nayiphi na imali.
I can't say much for it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu ngenxa.
This is possible if nothing else.	Oku kunokwenzeka ukuba akukho nto.
And not for a long, long time.	Kwaye hayi ixesha elide, elide.
You are busy.	Uxakekile uxakekile.
He wanted to know what was happening to me.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngam.
I will not have this.	Andiyi kuba nayo le.
He slept with it.	Walala nayo.
He does not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba enze le nto.
You better think of him bad.	Kungcono ucinge ngaye embi.
You may feel like you can't succeed.	Unokuba uziva ngathi awukwazi ukuphumelela.
Finally, he understood.	Ekugqibeleni, waqonda.
But this means very little.	Kodwa oku kuthetha kancinci kakhulu.
We want peace there.	Sifuna uxolo apho.
No one has spoken to you.	Akukho mntu uye wathetha nawe.
As you live in that.	Njengoko uhlala kuloo nto.
If you don't want to do something big.	Ukuba awufuni ukwenza into enkulu.
Do not go in front of you.	Musa ukuya phambi kwakho.
I'll take my talk later.	Ndiza kuthatha intetho yam kamva.
he asked again.	wabuza kwakhona.
I wanted so much more from this book.	Ndandifuna okuninzi kakhulu kule ncwadi.
I could not decide what to do first.	Andizange ndikwazi ukugqiba ukuba ndenze ntoni kuqala.
I hope you will live for many years.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala iminyaka emininzi.
Where you would like to live.	Apho ungathanda ukuhlala khona.
And next to him.	Kwaye ecaleni kwakhe.
Plus you know, too.	Ngaphezu koko uyazi, nawe.
We need to act fast.	Kufuneka senze ngokukhawuleza.
At first, he thought nothing of it.	Ekuqaleni, akazange acinge nto ngaloo nto.
That is certainly true.	Ngokwenene yinyani leyo.
They should not have gone.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba baye.
Then, maybe so.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
He did not have what he wanted.	Akazange abe nayo into ayifunayo.
He would tell her to leave.	Wayeza kumxelela ukuba ahambe.
He said no one.	Wathi akukho namnye.
One down.	Omnye phantsi.
I mean small.	Ndithetha encinci.
But now something has been done.	Kodwa ngoku into yenziwe.
He is even more determined.	Uzimisele ngakumbi.
Maybe you're telling the truth.	Mhlawumbi uthetha inyani.
He certainly wanted to die.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayefuna ukufa.
He would need help.	Wayeza kufuna uncedo.
And come to the back, not the front.	Kwaye uze ngasemva, hayi ngaphambili.
Then there is nothing.	Emva koko akukho nto.
One such place.	Enye indawo enjalo.
It is often difficult for me.	Udla ngokuba nzima kum.
I've been all my life.	Ndihambe ubomi bam bonke.
If anything, do the right thing.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na, wenze into elungileyo.
Yeah, look at that.	Ewe, jonga loo nto.
Yet everyone knows.	Nangona kunjalo wonke umntu uyazi.
That is the case in this case.	Kunjalo ke kule meko.
You are afraid of something.	Uyoyika into.
And maybe true.	Kwaye mhlawumbi inyaniso.
John knows that.	UYohane uyayazi loo nto.
Again, sorry about that.	Kwakhona, uxolo ngaloo nto.
So some people say.	Ngoko abanye abantu bathi.
He also did not want to stay.	Kwakhona wayengafuni ukuhlala.
Well, it's not there.	Ewe, akukho apho.
In a new place, not so much.	Kwindawo entsha, hayi kakhulu.
I know very well.	Ndiyazi kakhulu .
But even so, this is something new for me.	Kodwa nokuba kunjalo, le yinto entsha kum.
But this time a big mistake happened.	Kodwa ngeli xesha kwenzeka impazamo enkulu.
Then he had to stop.	Emva koko kwafuneka ayeke.
So, they say, it's okay.	Ngoko ke, bathi, kulungile.
He had to make a quick decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo ngokukhawuleza.
Finally, you know.	Ekugqibeleni, uyazi.
You don't have to stay here.	Akufuneki uhlale apha.
A better person.	Umntu ongcono ngakumbi.
You in prison.	Wena entolongweni.
I can't help that.	Andikwazi ukunceda kuloo nto.
We should have known then.	Bekufanele ukuba siyazi ngoko.
The doctor fell asleep.	Walala ugqirha.
Or any car.	Okanye nayiphi na imoto.
Of course there was nothing there.	Ewe kwakungekho nto apho.
So, it’s a big deal for me.	Ngoko, yinto enkulu kum.
It makes travel even more enjoyable.	Kwenza ukuhamba kube mnandi ngakumbi.
No one knows anything about him.	Akukho mntu wazi nto ngaye.
Something good is coming.	Kukho into entle ezayo.
We will try to make it fun.	Siza kuzama ukwenza kube mnandi.
He did not want to tell you.	Akazange afune ukukuxelela.
I don't know where he lives but.	Andazi apho ahlala khona kodwa.
I want to make one.	Ndifuna ukwenza enye.
I really never did, ever.	Ngokwenene zange, nanini na.
He can really sing.	Uyakwazi ngokwenene ukucula.
I heard my father talking about you.	Ndive utata ethetha ngawe.
That's really good.	Oko kulungile ngokwenene.
Then he realized that this was it.	Emva koko waqonda ukuba yiloo nto.
You can't take your time.	Awukwazi ukuthatha ixesha lakho.
I have to go alone.	Kufuneka ndihambe ndedwa.
Maybe years.	Mhlawumbi iminyaka.
But this is better.	Kodwa oku kungcono.
There is no such danger here.	Apha akukho ngozi enjalo.
I will be able to play again.	Ndiza kukwazi ukudlala kwakhona.
It is clear to drive.	Kucacile ukuqhuba.
Then, he did it again.	Emva koko, wayenza kwakhona.
Probably a new restaurant.	Mhlawumbi indawo yokutyela entsha.
Your older daughter.	Intombi yakho endala.
But not strange.	Kodwa hayi engaqhelekanga.
He died so many years.	Wafa iminyaka emininzi kangaka.
Well, and that's the way it is.	Kulungile, kwaye ke indlela.
That did not really happen.	Oko akuzange kube yinyani ngokwenene.
He would not buy a coat.	Wayengayi kuthenga idyasi.
Well, maybe not almost.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi phantse.
Okay bike.	Kulungile ibhayisekile.
He stared at the phone for a long time.	Wajonga ifowuni ixesha elide.
It’s hard to think otherwise for me.	Kunzima ukucinga ngenye indlela kum.
He looks like us.	Ukhangeleka ngathi.
Not until you find someone to take his place.	Hayi de wafumana umntu oza kuthatha indawo yakhe.
Not only for her but for me too.	Hayi ngaye kuphela kodwa nam.
This creates a new problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki entsha.
If he is not human.	Ukuba akangomntu.
For that would be strange.	Kuba oko kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
This, of course, is possible.	Oku, ngokwenene, kunokwenzeka.
This should be me.	Oku kufuneka kube ndim.
Not everyone.	Akunjalo wonke umntu.
He did not want her to leave now.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe ngoku.
It must be hard for you.	Kumele ukuba kunzima kuwe.
Not that he would ever tell anyone.	Akunjalo ukuba uya kuze axelele nabani na.
It will be painful at first.	Kuya kuba buhlungu ekuqaleni.
No one talks too much, really.	Akukho mntu uthetha kakhulu, ngokwenene.
We all know this.	Oku siyazi sonke.
He kept going down the old road.	Waqhubeka wehla ngendlela endala.
I also want to speak out.	Nam ndifuna ukuthetha phandle.
Ultimately everyone has to do their job.	Ekugqibeleni wonke umntu kufuneka enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I do not have much time.	Andinaxesha elininzi.
He too cannot speak.	Naye akakwazi kuthetha.
Maybe not the same thing, but still.	Mhlawumbi hayi into enye, kodwa kunjalo.
That really happened a little bit.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene kancinci.
I'm happy for you.	Ndiyavuya apha kuwe.
Or maybe it's a very bad thing.	Okanye mhlawumbi yinto embi kakhulu.
He did it then, he could do it again.	Wayenza ngoko, angayenza kwakhona.
So he finally had to leave.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni kwafuneka ahambe.
We need help here.	Sifuna uncedo apha.
Her mother told the doctor she knew.	Umama wakhe uxelele ugqirha ukuba uyazi.
So you work long hours for meager wages.	Ngoko usebenza iiyure ezininzi ngemali encinci.
I didn't want to do that now.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza loo nto ngoku.
I don't know much about one.	Andazi kangako ngenye.
She went to her bedroom in front of him.	Waya kwigumbi lakhe lokulala phambi kwakhe.
The picture will be back tomorrow.	Umfanekiso uya kubuya ngomso.
When you know you know.	Xa uyazi ukuba uyazi.
Thanks and I hope to learn more soon.	Enkosi kwaye ndiyathemba ukufunda ngakumbi kungekudala.
very late at night.	kakhulu ebusuku.
Look at the monkeys.	Nyani jonga.
He heard and understood.	Weva waqonda.
If you can talk about it.	Ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha ngayo .
Not that he had to.	Akunjalo ukuba kwafuneka enjenjalo.
Dad can't walk.	Utata akakwazi ukuhamba.
He’s not in this much.	Akakho kule nto kakhulu.
Then he looked up and looked around the room again.	Emva koko wajonga phezulu wajonga egumbini kwakhona.
He looked at the picture.	Uye wajonga umfanekiso.
If someone else does it, fine.	Ukuba omnye umntu uyayenza, kulungile.
Especially, if anything.	Ngakumbi, ukuba kukho nantoni na.
I could not do it alone.	Andikwazanga ukuyenza ndedwa.
I will not succeed in this.	Andiyi kuphumelela kule nto.
But no, he wants me to do it.	Kodwa hayi, ufuna ndiyenze.
She is trying hard.	Uzama ngamandla.
So it is clear.	Ngoko kucacile.
So, he is her friend.	Ngoko ke, ngumhlobo wakhe.
Probably a lot of money, too.	Mhlawumbi imali eninzi, nayo.
Because not everyone will do that.	Kuba wonke umntu akayi kuyenza loo nto.
I thought you should have it.	Ndicinge ukuba kufuneka ube nayo.
It will stay all day there.	Iya kuhlala imini yonke apho.
You already have the money.	Sele unayo imali.
Very good dog.	Inja elungileyo kakhulu.
He said it was a bad place.	Wathi indawo embi.
I'm not going there again.	Andiyi apho kwakhona.
I didn't think much of it.	Khange ndicinge nto ingako.
It must have been difficult for him.	Kumele ukuba kunzima kuye.
Not everything is weird.	Akunjalo yonke into engaqhelekanga.
And maybe not with you.	Kwaye mhlawumbi hayi nawe.
He drove away.	Uqhuba wemka.
He will go with me now.	Uza kuhamba nam ngoku.
Strange to him.	Engaqhelekanga kuye.
If you will get better.	Ukuba uya kuba ngcono.
But enough to think about.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukucinga.
I know why and how.	Ndiyazi ukuba kutheni kwaye njani.
But now he has succeeded.	Kodwa ngoku uphumelele.
He asked three questions.	Wabuza imibuzo emithathu.
Then aside again.	Emva koko ecaleni kwakhona.
He will stay at school.	Uza kuhlala esikolweni.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa ke kuza ingxaki.
However, he did not do so.	Kodwa ke, akazange enjenjalo.
Certainly true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani.
I have to think, alone.	Kufuneka ndicinge, ndedwa.
He wants to help you.	Unqwenela ukukunceda.
But yes, he died very quickly.	Kodwa ewe, wafa ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He never spoke to me.	Akazange athethe nam.
I couldn't think, I just felt.	Andikwazanga ukucinga, ndiziva kuphela.
Eyes down.	Amehlo phantsi.
So, to me it seems obvious.	Ke, kum kubonakala kucacile.
It's just hard to see.	Kunzima nje ukubona.
What is that? 	Yintoni leyo?
But not mom.	Kodwa hayi umama.
He has admitted that.	Uye wavuma ukuba.
Your daughter, you are the only one.	Intombi yakho, nguwe wedwa.
It's not fun in that.	Akukho mnandi kuloo nto.
He said he never really thought about it.	Wathi akazange acinge ngayo ngokwenene.
Please take a look at ours.	Nceda ujonge wethu.
He is sitting right in front of you.	Uhleli kanye phambi kwakho.
It will be a little fun.	Kuya kuba mnandi kancinci.
I have to be alone to think.	Kufuneka ndibe ndedwa ndicinge.
Tell me what happened to you.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
Look and make your age.	Jonga kwaye wenze iminyaka yakho.
Even one would be fun.	Nokuba enye iya kuba mnandi.
But something is coming.	Kodwa kukho into ezayo.
Eating food.	Ukutya ukutya.
Or maybe you don't want to.	Okanye mhlawumbi awufuni.
We'll see what happens now.	Siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
Now look at the way.	Ngoku jonga indlela.
There is a problem coming.	Kukho ingxaki ezayo.
I think that would be fun.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba mnandi oko.
I'm glad it was.	Ndiyavuya kuba kube njalo.
I could not complete the task.	Khange ndikwazi ukugqiba lo msebenzi.
Right here in town.	Kanye apha edolophini.
I am here every day.	Ndilapha yonke imihla.
Or, maybe you just are.	Okanye, mhlawumbi unjalo nje.
He wanted to, of course.	Wayefuna, kunjalo.
Not a bit of it, though.	Hayi kancinci kuyo, nangona kunjalo.
That will be the whole thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto yonke.
I don't believe in it now.	Andikholelwa kuyo ngoku.
He lived next to me.	Wayehlala ecaleni kwam.
It just seems like that.	Kubonakala nje ngolo hlobo.
Really, just in time.	Ngokwenene, kwangethuba.
He was certainly not well.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho kakuhle.
I don't want it now.	Andifuni ngoku.
Sounds good though.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile kodwa.
You know this is going to be a big job.	Uyazi ukuba oku kuya kuba ngumsebenzi omkhulu.
It’s like you’re just wasting time.	Ngathi uchitha nje ixesha.
Please make a way for this to happen.	Nceda wenze indlela yokuba oku kwenzeke.
It would seem.	Bekuya kubonakala.
I know you think you can't.	Ndiyazi ukuba ucinga ukuba awukwazi.
No need .	Akukho mfuneko .
But here it is difficult.	Kodwa apha kunzima.
I don't want to do that again.	Andifuni kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
This is difficult, to say the least.	Oku kunzima, ukuthetha kancinci.
I can't wait for this.	Andikwazi ukulinda oku.
It’s hard to do here, though.	Kunzima ukwenza apha, nangona kunjalo.
Just tell me a little bit about you.	Ndixelele nje into encinci ngawe.
Or you did not.	Okanye awuzange wenze njalo.
Everyone knows that, for sure.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I want to go in my spare time.	Ndifuna ukuhamba ngexesha lam.
So stop playing with me.	Yeka ke ukudlala ngam.
You need to know where it is going.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi apho iya khona.
You too.	Wena naye.
Many people say that lately.	Abantu abaninzi bathi mva nje.
This is not easy, but it is not possible.	Oku akukho lula, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Not if it is possible.	Akunjalo ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Late at school.	Emva kwexesha esikolweni.
And if you say yes.	Kwaye ukuba uthe ewe.
He ran to my side.	Wabaleka weza ecaleni kwam.
She is here in bed.	Ulapha ebhedini.
I wish in a different way now.	Ndinqwenela ngenye indlela ngoku.
Unless it seems like nothing at all.	Ngaphandle kokuba kubonakala ngathi akukho konke.
I asked to know.	Ndacela ukwazi.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Uthetha ukuba, mhlawumbi, kodwa akakwazi.
I want to do what it takes.	Ndifuna ukwenza oko kuthatha.
So this is very demanding.	Ngoko oku kufuna kakhulu.
Thank you very much! 	Enkosi kakhulu!
My wife went with him.	Umfazi wam wahamba naye.
He didn't even know where it was.	Wayengazi nokuba iphi na.
He’s been out for a week.	Uye waphuma iveki.
But as it is.	Kodwa njengoko kunjalo.
Everyone came out.	Wonke umntu waphuma.
He came to me for help.	Weza kum efuna uncedo.
I went to his house last night.	Ndiye endlini yakhe phezolo.
He wanted to drive more.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba ngakumbi.
Shirt.	Ihempe .
He wanted to be a doctor.	Wayefuna ukuba ngugqirha.
He started talking but thought better of it.	Waqalisa ukuthetha kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
I never saw anyone.	Zange ndabona mntu.
He had done this before clearly.	Wayenza le nto ngaphambili ngokucacileyo.
I do not like his way.	Andiyithandi indlela yakhe.
It seems like a good thing to do.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto entle ukuyenza.
Walking forward far away.	Ukuhamba ukuya ngaphambili kude.
And you talk to everyone.	Kwaye uthetha naye wonke umntu.
I don't know how that happened, to be honest.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko, xa ndithetha inyani.
He really did.	Wenze ngokwenene.
But then something unusual happened next.	Kodwa emva koko kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
But he stayed for a long time.	Kodwa wahlala ixesha elide.
He thought he might be the father.	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba nguye utata.
Great job !.	Mhle kakhulu umsebenzi!.
You will have to be angry today.	Kuya kufuneka ube nomsindo namhlanje.
Certainly, now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ngoku.
I would love to try that.	Ndingathanda ukuzama oko.
Death to me.	Ukufa kum.
What a meal.	Yintoni isidlo.
I'll tell her, if she likes it.	Ndiza kumxelela, ukuba uyathanda.
You will need to know more about him.	Kuya kufuneka ukwazi ngakumbi ngaye.
Apparently nothing.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho nto.
Until then, enough.	Kude kube ngoko, ngokwaneleyo.
That is the job.	Ngumsebenzi ke lowo.
I knew about him.	Ndandisazi ngaye.
I'm the problem there.	Ndim ingxaki apho.
If not, they will get someone else to do it.	Ukuba akunjalo, baya kufumana omnye umntu ukuba ayenze.
This is difficult, though.	Oku kunzima, nangona kunjalo.
He knew he didn't like it either.	Wayesazi ukuba naye akayithandi loo nto.
But there is no way I can tell him.	Kodwa akukho ndlela yokuba ndimxelele.
Yes, it can be very good.	Ewe, kunokuba kuhle kakhulu.
It would be nice to see.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukubona.
He decided to quit immediately, but he never succeeded.	Wagqiba ekubeni ayeke kwangoko, kodwa akazange aphumelele.
But there is another future.	Kodwa kukho elinye ithuba elizayo.
Or, not recently.	Okanye, hayi mva nje.
You will not speak unless you speak with them.	Awuyi kuthetha ngaphandle kokuba uthethe nawe.
Yes, she is very beautiful.	Ewe, mhle kakhulu.
Maybe later .	Mhlawumbi mva .
Not without it.	Hayi ngaphandle kunjalo.
He did it and gave it to me.	Uyenzile ke wandinika.
You will say whatever you do.	Uya kuthetha nantoni na ukuyenza.
He is just one good friend at a time.	Ngumhlobo nje omnye olungileyo ngexesha.
I can't be me.	Andikwazi ukuba ndim.
And certainly for sure.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ngokuqinisekileyo.
A lot is always better.	Okuninzi kuhlala kungcono.
But no this, of course.	Kodwa hayi le, kunjalo.
He knows that any of us can do that.	Uyazi ukuba nabani na kuthi angayenza loo nto.
He continued about it yesterday after lunch.	Uye waqhubeka malunga nayo izolo emva kwesidlo sasemini.
You will know this.	Uya kukwazi oku.
I think we should do that.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
Or there was no reason.	Okanye kwakungekho sizathu.
He will go with you.	Uza kuhamba nawe.
I live at home with the kids.	Ndihlala ekhaya nabantwana.
So it should be tomorrow.	Ngoko kufuneka kube ngomso.
I heard all about you.	Ndive konke ngawe.
So he did not know.	Ngoko wayengazi.
Probably too long.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elide kakhulu.
It seems to me too long.	Kubonakala kum ixesha elide kakhulu.
This will continue for hours.	Oku kuya kuqhubeka iiyure.
This time, it will be good.	Ngeli xesha, kuya kuba kuhle.
Never before has such a thing happened.	Ayizange yenzeke into enjalo ngaphambili.
He didn't want to be here again.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha kwakhona.
Then, no.	Emva koko, hayi.
You work your way to it.	Usebenza indlela yakho ukuya kuyo.
That will make the big task much harder.	Oko kuya kwenza ukuba umsebenzi omkhulu ube nzima kakhulu.
Better give me something.	Kungcono ndinike into.
He thought he had done something wrong.	Wayecinga ukuba wenze into engalunganga.
That's the whole thing.	Yiloo nto yonke into.
The truth is the truth.	Inyani yinyani.
Old and new.	Endala kunye entsha.
All of them.	Bonke bobabini.
Maybe it was not necessary.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho mfuneko.
You need to know what's going on.	Kufuneka wazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
He told me, too.	Wandixelela, naye.
Well, he thought.	Hayi ke, wacinga.
Here, the problem is me.	Apha, ingxaki ndim.
So it is difficult to work.	Ngoko kunzima ukusebenza.
And I haven't heard anything back.	Kwaye andizange ndive nantoni na emva.
I have to think so.	Ndifanele ukucinga njalo.
That happened right in front of me.	Oko kwenzeka kanye phambi kwam.
Other things, not so much.	Ezinye izinto, hayi kakhulu.
Well, for a long time.	Kulungile, ixesha elide.
He arrived here this morning.	Ufike apha ekuseni.
Tell me all is well.	Ndixelele konke kulungile.
Probably even better.	Mhlawumbi nokuba kuhle kakhulu.
And certainly no one is talking about it.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu uthetha ngayo.
And it's not even good.	Kwaye akukho nokuba kuhle.
Here, you just work all the time.	Apha, usebenza nje ngalo lonke ixesha.
It will not be anything, and it will be.	Asiyi kuba yinto, kwaye kuya kuba njalo.
And another week.	Kwaye enye iveki.
Then we will wait.	Emva koko siya kulinda.
If only it could be so.	Ukuba kuphela kunokuba njalo.
And the reason that is that.	Kwaye isizathu sokuba oko kukuba.
There is always something.	Kuhlala kukho into.
I don’t know much about it very much.	Andazi kakhulu malunga kakhulu.
I really did not.	Ngokwenene andizange.
You read people of all ages.	Ufunda abantu kuyo yonke iminyaka.
But he did not want to talk.	Kodwa wayengafuni kuthetha.
If not, then you will do it.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngoko uya kuyenza.
There is one now.	Kukho enye ngoku.
You will be able to stay.	Uya kukwazi ukuhlala.
I want to talk about us.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngathi.
Finally, something wonderful happened to us.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka into entle kuthi.
And she eats well.	Kwaye utya kakuhle.
But whatever.	Kodwa nokuba yintoni na.
So much for prison.	Kakhulu entolongweni.
It certainly takes time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuthatha ixesha.
Here everything is man-made.	Apha yonke into yenziwe ngumntu.
Very clearly, yes.	Ngokucacileyo kakhulu, ewe.
I do not have to stay.	Akufunekanga ndihlale.
You know that for a long time now.	Uyayazi loo nto ixesha elide ngoku.
He wanted her to go home.	Wayefuna ukuba agoduke.
But even then, it is impossible to know.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo, akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
Then he went to it.	Emva koko waya kuyo.
Not just to him.	Hayi nje kuye.
But I never had a problem.	Kodwa andizange ndibe nayo ingxaki.
Please check our location.	Nceda ujonge indawo yethu.
You know what happened last night.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni phezolo.
He did not once in a while.	Akazange kanye kanye ngexesha.
The woman eats less.	Umfazi utya kancinci.
I needed help.	Ndandifuna uncedo.
He just looked quickly.	Wajonga nje ngokukhawuleza.
I didn’t want to see much of it.	Ndandingafuni ukubona okuninzi kuyo.
Then it should be good that it is true.	Ke kufuneka kube kuhle ukuba yinyani.
Otherwise, nothing happens.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho nto eyenzekayo.
I think you know that, though.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto, nangona kunjalo.
That happens enough at work.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwaneleyo emsebenzini.
That does it.	Oko kuyenza.
And he was clearly scared.	Kwaye wayesoyika ngokucacileyo.
But the police did nothing.	Kodwa amapolisa akazange enze nto.
I did that all week.	Ndenze loo nto kwiveki yonke.
Well, he said something like that to me.	Ewe, wathetha into enjalo kum.
No, another thing.	Hayi, enye into.
But there is not much to do about it.	Kodwa akukho nto ingako yokwenza ngayo.
I thought .	Ndicinge .
She started singing with him.	Waqalisa ukucula kunye naye.
But now he knew that he would succeed.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi ukuba wayeza kuphumelela.
And then, you might be right.	Kwaye ke, unokuba ulungile.
But you will not be alone.	Kodwa akuyi kuba wedwa.
But that will not get better.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba ngcono.
This is what it will take.	Yile nto iza kuthatha.
He has to stay there for two days.	Kufuneka ahlale apho iintsuku ezimbini.
He said the book.	Uye wathi incwadi.
But it will not come in our time.	Kodwa akuyi kufika ngexesha lethu.
This, and this, but not this.	Le, kwaye le, kodwa hayi le.
That's all right.	Kulungile kuphela.
Just playful, but still.	Ukudlala nje, kodwa kunjalo.
I know you're ready to go.	Ndiyazi ukuba ukulungele ukuhamba.
Now it will be great !.	Ngoku kuya kuba kuhle!.
However, you did not.	Nangona kunjalo, awuzange.
You look smart in it.	Ukhangeleka ukrelekrele kuyo.
So you have time.	Ngoko unexesha.
This is not very difficult, but it is not necessary.	Oku akukho nzima kakhulu, kodwa akuyomfuneko.
You should know this about me.	Kufuneka uyazi le nto ngam.
I've made a new person.	Ndenze umntu omtsha.
It is best to come quickly.	Kungcono ukuba uze ngokukhawuleza.
No one has done better.	Akukho mntu wenze ngcono.
Soon everyone will be gone.	Kungekudala wonke umntu uya kube engekho.
And you know the answer.	Kwaye uyayazi impendulo.
My dad is too old to do that.	Utata mdala kakhulu ukuba angayenza.
I will finally.	Ndiza ekugqibeleni.
And it's very good though.	Kwaye kuhle kakhulu kunjalo.
She is afraid of what she will do or say.	Uyoyika ukuba uya kwenza ntoni na okanye athethe.
He said everything here is fine.	Wathi yonke into apha ilungile.
And that means you can have time to be alone.	Kwaye kuthetha ukuba unokuba nexesha lokuba wedwa.
They came in.	Wangena .
Or what you think.	Okanye ukuba ucinga ntoni.
You know that's a good thing.	Uyazi ukuba yinto entle leyo.
But he had to do it, and he does it now.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba ayenze, kwaye ayenze ngoku.
But everything after that.	Kodwa yonke into emva koko.
We want you to come, but you have to stay.	Sifuna ukuba uze, kodwa kufuneka uhlale.
Look at the way it makes you think.	Jonga indlela ekwenza ucinge ngayo.
I can read his mind.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda ingqondo yakhe.
And again a week later.	Kwaye kwakhona kwiveki emva koko.
Of course we did here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo senze apha.
In the end, it has to happen.	Ekugqibeleni, kufuneka yenzeke.
My daughter that.	Intombi yam ukuba.
Or my bedroom.	Okanye igumbi lam lokulala.
I will try again.	Ndiza kuzama kwakhona.
It’s just anything but.	Yinto nantoni na kodwa nje.
He told me who he was.	Wandixelela ukuba ngubani.
If not, you stay.	Ukuba akunjalo, uhlala.
And, for a long time.	Kwaye, ixesha elide.
And then, well, this happens.	Kwaye ke, ke, oku kwenzeka.
He asked me to leave.	Wandicela ukuba ndihambe.
Some in town, some not.	Abanye edolophini, abanye akunjalo.
Being human can be very painful.	Ukuba ngumntu kunokuba buhlungu kakhulu.
I will receive a letter.	Ndiza kufumana ileta.
This was not so much.	Oku kwakungekho kakhulu.
Or as much money, as possible.	Okanye imali eninzi, njengoko kunokwenzeka.
Quite a lot.	Okuninzi kakhulu.
She is very happy, too.	Uyavuya kakhulu, naye.
They stay there all day.	Bahlala apho imini yonke.
He said it would be a job.	Uthe kuya kuba ngumsebenzi.
He was afraid he would not come back.	Wayesoyika ukuba akayi kubuya.
Everything is fine.	Yonke into ilungile .
I thought so.	Ndandicinga ukuba.
But one should not think.	Kodwa umntu akufanele acinge.
Or unless it is beautiful.	Okanye ngaphandle kokuba mhle.
I just didn't know it.	Bendingayazi nje.
Please check for errors.	Nceda ujonge iimpazamo.
I wanted meat.	Bendifuna inyama.
Well, not really, but almost.	Kulungile, hayi ngokwenene, kodwa phantse.
He has to tell someone.	Kufuneka axelele umntu.
He went to sleep all night.	Wahamba walala ubusuku bonke.
That would be this.	Oko kuya kuba oku.
Nothing in college.	Akukho nto ekholejini.
It also seems to be really well done.	Kwakhona kubonakala ukuba yenziwe kakuhle ngokwenene.
And then shopping.	Kwaye ke ukuthenga.
You feel more.	Uziva ngakumbi.
I've done it your whole life.	Ndiyenze ubomi bakho bonke.
Give me a little money.	Ndinike imali encinci.
That means you sit down.	Oko kuthetha ukuba uhlala phantsi.
But it works fast.	Kodwa usebenza ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe he wanted a dad after that.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna utata emva koko.
You think .	Ucinga .
You just want to.	Ufuna nje .
But he wanted something else.	Kodwa wayefuna enye into.
No, it is not difficult at all.	Hayi, akukho nzima konke konke.
This is what we need to do.	Yile nto ekufuneka siyenze.
The doctor made the money.	Ugqirha wenza imali ke leyo.
He didn't want to make a small statement, of course.	Wayengafuni ukwenza intetho encinci, kunjalo.
He did not know that it could be so.	Akazange azi ukuba inokuba njalo.
The music is just right.	Umculo ulungile nje.
Yes, every day.	Ewe, yonke imihla.
Tomorrow fast enough.	Ngomso ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
I don't even remember what it was.	Andikhumbuli nokuba yintoni.
It is difficult at this time.	Kunzima ngeli xesha.
Clearly, it means.	Ngokucacileyo, kuthetha .
I'm not that far away.	Andikho kude kangako.
The thing is, what do you do with it?	Into kukuba wenze ntoni ngayo.
I forgot to tell you.	Ndilibele ukukuxelela.
But not today, she has decided.	Kodwa hayi namhlanje, uye wagqiba.
I don't want him to leave immediately though.	Andifuni ahambe ngokukhawuleza kodwa.
Not a bad thing, really.	Hayi into embi, ngokwenene.
As everyone agreed.	Njengoko wonke umntu wavuma.
He may have fallen asleep.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba walala.
I think we will do a much better job.	Ndicinga ukuba siya kwenza umsebenzi ongcono kakhulu.
But still don't stop reading now.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo musa ukuyeka ukufunda ngoku.
Every day, it gets harder for me.	Yonke imihla, kuba nzima kum.
Moreover, the work will be very difficult.	Ngaphezu koko, umsebenzi uya kuba nzima kakhulu.
He never came to me.	Zange angene kum.
And it is almost done.	Kwaye phantse yenziwe.
It all comes slowly.	Konke kuza kancinci.
And he just did it.	Kwaye uyenzile nje.
My daughter is going.	Intombi yam iya.
Not immediately after that.	Hayi kwangoko emva koko.
To be a little.	Ukuba kancinci.
What do you think ?.	Ingaba ucinga ntoni ?.
Do you know?.	Ingaba uyazi?.
Two weeks away.	Iiveki ezimbini kude.
However, it can be too much.	Nangona kunjalo, inokuba yinto eninzi kakhulu.
You will find the answer.	Uya kufumana impendulo.
Some people will be able to do that.	Abanye abantu baya kukwazi ukwenza oko.
The same is true today.	Kunjalo nangoku.
And now there was no question about it.	Kwaye ngoku kwakungekho mbuzo ngayo.
You think back to your beginning with him.	Ucinga emva ekuqaleni kwakho kunye naye.
Now that seems like a small thing.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi yinto encinci.
Death now.	Ukufa ngoku.
We want that.	Sifuna loo nto.
You should be right about this.	Ufanele ukuba ulungile kule nto.
I'm sure everyone did their best.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba wonke umntu wenze konke okusemandleni akhe.
This means you don’t have to look at debt.	Oku kuthetha ukuba akufuneki ujonge ityala.
Nobody wants this to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba oku kwenzeke.
I wanted to find a new place.	Ndandifuna ukufumana indawo entsha.
And we don't have to do it.	Kwaye akufuneki siyenze.
Check out our old site if you like.	Jonga indawo yethu endala ukuba uyathanda.
Do you want to read?	Uyafuna ukufunda?
And with all that.	Kanye nayo yonke loo nto.
Please just go.	Nceda uhambe nje.
There is something wrong with me.	Kukho into embi ngam.
And now it is possible.	Kwaye ngoku kunokwenzeka.
I would love to work with him someday.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza naye ngenye imini.
So the question is what you want to do.	Ngoko umbuzo kukuba ufuna ukwenza ntoni.
No one deserves to die.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukufa.
You certainly should.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufanele.
Marriage is only good if it lasts a long time.	Umtshato ulungile kuphela ukuba uhlala uhleli.
Nice place now.	Indawo entle ngoku.
Everyone knows everyone or everyone knows it.	Wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu okanye wazi wonke umntu.
Just stop dying.	Ukuyeka nje ukufa.
I hope we get more people.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siya kufumana abantu abaninzi.
Big, big, big.	Enkulu, enkulu, enkulu.
I just want to know if you are here.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba ulapha.
He thought this way too much.	Wayecinga ngale ndlela kakhulu.
And, obviously.	Kwaye, ngokucacileyo.
But that happened a long time ago.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kudala.
Not you, not me, not anyone.	Hayi wena, hayi mna, hayi nabani na.
If it is too good to be true, it is not.	Ukuba kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani, akunjalo.
Yes, there is a problem.	Ewe, kukho ingxaki.
If a woman knew, everyone knows.	Ukuba umfazi wayesazi, wonke umntu uyazi.
But again it is not so easy.	Kodwa kwakhona akukho lula kangako.
And now we better go.	Kwaye ngoku kungcono sihambe.
Everything is small, though.	Yonke into encinci, nangona kunjalo.
But nobody says anything about him.	Kodwa akukho bani uthetha nto ngaye.
It happens to everything and everyone at all times.	Kwenzeka ngayo yonke into kwaye wonke umntu ngalo lonke ixesha.
Every day almost.	Yonke imihla phantse.
What a problem.	Yeyiphi ingxaki.
Just to see what happened.	Ukubona nje ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
It’s hard to do and very hard to do well.	Kunzima ukwenza kwaye kunzima kakhulu ukwenza kakuhle.
He told me to do it.	Wathi mandiyenze.
He can't think.	Akakwazi ukucinga.
That obviously did not happen.	Loo nto ngokucacileyo ayizange yenzeke.
And it really will be.	Kwaye ngenene kuya kuba njalo.
You know who that person is.	Uyazi ukuba ngubani loo mntu.
Not too much and not too little.	Hayi kakhulu kwaye hayi kancinci kakhulu.
It really comes in handy.	Ngokwenene iza kakuhle.
I'm sure he feels the same way.	Ndiqinisekile naye uziva njalo.
He thought it was true.	Wayecinga ukuba yinyani.
There is enough, though.	Kukho ngokwaneleyo, nangona kunjalo.
But he has run away.	Kodwa uye wabaleka.
I think that's fine, give it to me.	Ndicinga ukuba kuhle, ndinike.
Lots of time with you.	Ixesha elininzi nawe.
It's better to have him.	Kungcono ukuba naye.
What's going on .	Kwenzeka ntoni .
He only did this to me.	Wenza oku kuphela nam.
But he never did that to me.	Kodwa zange ayenze lonto nam.
You can do it .	Ungayenza .
I have to come here, now.	Kufuneka ndize apha, ngoku.
Now, that might be something.	Ngoku, inokuba yinto ethile.
So he went away and ate.	Wahamba ke, watya.
There are exceptions, though.	Kukho ngaphandle, nangona kunjalo.
The question was never.	Umbuzo awuzange ube nokuba.
And yesterday, me.	Ke izolo, mna.
Good picture.	Umfanekiso olungileyo.
I want to tell the truth.	Ndifuna ukuthetha inyani.
So sooner or later he would come.	Ngoko ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva wayeza kufika.
He agreed on many things with her.	Wavuma izinto ezininzi kunye naye.
It would be nice to see everyone.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukubona wonke umntu.
There must be something wrong with her.	Kumele ukuba kukho into engalunganga kuye.
But help me anyway.	Kodwa ndincede kunjalo.
Or anyone in it.	Okanye nabani na kuyo.
Eventually all of this will end.	Ekugqibeleni konke oku kuya kuphela.
And then we want you to do that again.	Kwaye ke sifuna ukuba uyenze loo nto kwakhona.
You think that will not happen.	Ucinga ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
Not the first.	Hayi kuqala .
Some questions at the end.	Imibuzo ethile ekugqibeleni.
I did not go to dinner.	Khange ndiye kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
For there is none.	Ngokuba akukho namnye.
If so, you need to do something else.	Ukuba kunjalo, kufuneka wenze enye into.
You will make the same mistake today.	Uza kwenza impazamo efanayo namhlanje.
But he did not say this.	Kodwa akazange athethe oku.
He became his own person.	Waba ngumntu wakhe.
What we know about it.	Oko siyazi ngayo.
I didn’t want a bit.	Bendingafuni kancinci.
He pretends he doesn't want to be there.	Wenza ngathi akafuni ukuba lapho.
Not me, but everyone.	Hayi mna, kodwa wonke umntu.
To do nothing.	Ukuze wenze akukho.
You have to do what you have to do.	Kufuneka wenze into ekufuneka uyenzile.
They went to a place.	Baye kwindawo.
Driving to the hospital.	Ukuqhuba ukuya esibhedlele.
More time is required.	Ixesha elininzi kufuneka.
I didn't want to do it without you.	Bendingafuni ukuyenza ngaphandle kwakho.
He drives in front of me.	Uqhuba phambi kwam.
He came after he had fallen asleep.	Uye weza emva kokuba ulele.
Then, he saw something else.	Emva koko, wabona enye into.
Maybe it's clear to you.	Mhlawumbi kucacile kuwe.
But they will be with me.	Kodwa baya kuba nam.
I don't understand very well, you know.	Andiqondi kakuhle, uyazi.
No one will ever know you are looking at someone.	Akukho mntu uya kuze azi ukuba ujonge umntu.
You look at something behind me.	Ujonge into emva kwam.
Don't be sad for me.	Musa ukuba buhlungu ngenxa yam.
I know he will never come again.	Ndiyazi ukuba akayi kubuya eze kwakhona.
Not really.	Akukho nyani .
Great place, by the way.	Indawo enkulu, ngendlela.
He will not be alone.	Akayi kuba yedwa.
And then everyone knows.	Kwaye ke wonke umntu uyazi.
There is no turning back.	Akukho kubuya mva.
Again, this seems very difficult.	Kwakhona, oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
You do not have to decide now.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoku.
How do you know that.	Uyazi njani loo nto.
It's hard to.	Kunzima ukuba .
You have a number.	Unayo inombolo.
Or this.	Okanye le.
And everyone is fine.	Kwaye wonke umntu ulungile.
That is why you want peace.	Yiyo loo nto ufuna uxolo.
And then in this case, it's the same thing.	Kwaye ke kule meko, yinto enye.
Well, that's the thing.	Kulungile, nantso into.
Although certainly possible.	Nangona ngokuqinisekileyo kunokwenzeka.
Her mother now.	Umama wakhe ngoku.
I'm looking at that place.	Ndijonge kuloo ndawo.
I will do it for both of us.	Ndiza kuyenza kuthi sobabini.
It will definitely be high.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kuba phezulu.
But, no, in this case.	Kodwa, hayi, kule meko.
I thought you spoke well.	Ndandicinga ukuba uthetha kakuhle.
But you may have fallen asleep.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba uye walala.
Tell me, then.	Ndixelele, emva koko.
It's hard to tell which one.	Kunzima ukuxelela ukuba yeyiphi.
No matter how much you want it.	Nokuba ufuna kangakanani.
Or a name.	Okanye igama.
There it is, there.	Nantso ke, phaya.
The fact is, it did not have to be this way.	Inyaniso kukuba, kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
I want to do that.	Ndifuna ukuyenza loo nto.
I did it at home.	Ndenze ekhaya.
Something happened to it.	Kukho into eyenzekileyo kuyo.
Not your problem.	Hayi ingxaki yakho.
She looked down at her son.	Wajonga phantsi unyana wakhe.
And somebody else, and so forth.	Kwaye omnye umntu, njalo njalo.
No one really talks like that.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngolo hlobo ngokwenene.
You certainly do not want to stay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awufuni kuhlala.
He is about to do something.	Sele eza kwenza into.
Not just to help.	Hayi nje ukunceda.
Sitting, up.	Ukuhlala, phezulu.
And she is wearing something more beautiful.	Kwaye unxibe into entle ngakumbi.
Everyone does that, a lot of the time.	Wonke umntu wenza njalo, ixesha elininzi.
He thought it was her.	Wayecinga ukuba kuye.
We will wait until tonight.	Siza kulinda kude kube ngoku ngokuhlwa.
And a book.	Kwaye incwadi.
Don't stay there.	Musa ukuhlala apho.
She was afraid to get a job.	Wayesoyika ukufumana umsebenzi.
He seemed to be doing a lot of that lately.	Wayebonakala ekwenza oko kakhulu mva nje.
Or to see things.	Okanye ukubona izinto.
And he is going to do something bad.	Kwaye uza kwenza into embi.
But well, that's right.	Kodwa kuhle, kunjalo.
He found a place.	Wafumana indawo .
But he looked at his phone.	Kodwa wajonga ifowuni yakhe.
Everything in everything.	Yonke into kuyo yonke into.
Work means food.	Ukusebenza kuthetha ukutya.
Or go.	Okanye uhambe.
And he was not alone.	Kwaye yayingenguye yedwa.
He later told his son why.	Kamva waxelela unyana wakhe isizathu.
But this is very good.	Kodwa oku kuhle kakhulu.
You certainly know this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyakwazi oku.
I would just like to know why.	Ndingathanda nje ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
I can't eat anything.	Andikwazi kutya nto.
He certainly made an image.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wenza umfanekiso.
Yes, yes, but no.	Ewe, ewe, kodwa hayi.
Then it comes to me.	Emva koko iza kum.
At the time, he wanted to be a doctor.	Ngelo xesha, wayefuna ukuba ngugqirha.
The question is time consuming.	Umbuzo udlala ixesha.
I can't tell you everything.	Andikwazi ukukuxelela yonke into.
Yes? 	Ewe?
He is scared to death.	Woyika ukufa.
Going to dinner together.	Ukuya kwisidlo kunye.
Good enough for me.	Ilungile ngokwaneleyo kum.
He knew he would never do that.	Wayesazi ukuba akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
He tries to get out of it at first.	Uzama ukuphuma kuyo ekuqaleni.
And there.	Kwaye apho .
My father was wrong.	Utata wayecinga kakubi.
And he will do that.	Kwaye uya kuyenza loo nto.
He wants a big one.	Ufuna enkulu.
Don't say this.	Musa ukuthetha oku.
Someone is coming this week.	Umntu uza kule veki.
Stop my waiting.	Yeka ukulinda kwam.
I mean one woman.	Ndithetha umfazi omnye.
She wanted to see her children.	Wayefuna ukubona abantwana bakhe.
But this book is something for now.	Kodwa le ncwadi yinto ngoku.
Before he could think of anything better, he continued.	Ngaphambi kokuba acinge ngcono, waqhubeka.
No, you can't meet him.	Hayi, awukwazi ukudibana naye.
She is wearing very low heels.	Unxibe phantsi kakhulu.
Sounds like a good job.	Kubonakala ngathi ngumsebenzi omhle.
Until next week !.	Kude kube kwiveki ezayo!.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi akukho konke konke.
It will happen to you.	Kuya kwenzeka kuwe.
Sorry, I didn't know you were the same person.	Uxolo, bendingazi ukuba ungumntu omnye.
Your job will be much easier this way.	Umsebenzi wakho uya kuba lula kakhulu ngale ndlela.
I'm sure about this and you should be too.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto kwaye ufanele ukuba nawe.
He knew but little.	Wayesazi kodwa kancinci.
And this is really the case.	Kwaye oku kunjalo ngokwenene.
I just want to eat something.	Ndifuna nje ukutya into.
Now you must pass the test.	Ngoku kufuneka uphumelele uvavanyo.
Everyone told me.	Wonke umntu undixelele.
But he also did not know.	Kodwa ke naye wayengazi.
He likes to have a party at home with friends.	Uthanda ukwenza itheko ekhaya nabahlobo.
I tried to think.	Ndazama ukucinga.
That's why you need to do this.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka wenze oku.
One of us had to do that.	Omnye wethu kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I've never seen him talk like this before.	Andizange ndimbone ethetha ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
Not in the right way.	Hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
He has lain down.	Uye walala phantsi.
I wanted to win right away.	Ndandifuna ukuphumelela ngoko nangoko.
Not too much to see, really.	Akukho kakhulu ukubona, ngokwenene.
Now, almost everyone knows this.	Ngoku, phantse wonke umntu uyayazi le nto.
Even really good.	Nokuba kuhle ngokwenene.
Everyone seems to be talking about it.	Wonke umntu ubonakala ethetha ngayo.
He just wants to help.	Ufuna nje ukunceda.
I think you did more than that.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze ngaphezu koko.
That, however, did not happen here.	Oko, nangona kunjalo, akuzange kwenzeke apha.
I don't see anything about it.	Andiboni nto ngayo.
Maybe you went alone.	Mhlawumbi uye wahamba yedwa.
But there was none.	Kodwa kwakungekho namnye.
I thought that was fine.	Bendicinga ukuba oko kulungile.
I did not know how it would end.	Ndandingazi ukuba iza kuphela njani.
Yes, to do another.	Ewe, ukwenza enye.
I did this myself.	Ndenze oku ngokwam.
Probably everyone is asleep.	Mhlawumbi wonke umntu ulele.
Absolutely better.	Ngcono ngokupheleleyo.
My father stayed.	Utata wahlala.
As we have created this problem.	Njengoko senze le ngxaki.
But he is determined.	Kodwa uzimisele.
I do not remember how far away it was.	Andikhumbuli ukuba kude kangakanani.
Not better.	Hayi ngcono.
And he looks very much like her.	Kwaye ufana naye kakhulu.
Or because of me.	Okanye ngenxa yam.
He opened his window.	Wavula ifestile yakhe.
Better, better.	Kungcono, kungcono.
And so on and so forth.	Kwaye njalo, kwaye enye.
I went to prison.	Ndaya entolongweni.
Now you know.	Ngoku nawe uyazi.
But he has agreed to stay for another week.	Kodwa uye wavuma ukuhlala enye iveki.
And right here.	Kwaye kanye apha.
Glad to finish.	Ndiyavuya ukugqiba.
I decided to go the other way.	Ndagqiba ekubeni ndihambe ngenye indlela.
That one should be with us.	Lowo ufanele ukuba nathi.
They never said do it here.	Zange bathi wenze apha.
Night, day.	Ubusuku, imini.
I look at him again.	Ndiphinde ndijonge kuye.
Then come home.	Emva koko uze ekhaya.
He will never think of me again.	Soze aphinde acinge ngam.
One way to do it.	Indlela enye yokwenza.
I only wanted one.	Ndandifuna enye kuphela.
Mom and all that.	Umama nayo yonke loo nto.
All about you and only you.	Konke ngawe kwaye nguwe kuphela.
That happens to us all the time.	Oko kwenzeka kuthi ngalo lonke ixesha.
I just love it there.	Ndiyayithanda nje apho.
I'm not sure you know.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyazi.
Looks like I don't have it.	Kubonakala ngathi andinayo.
I only saw it.	Ndabona kuphela.
A lot doesn’t have to be better.	Okuninzi akuyomfuneko ukuba kube ngcono.
Your job should be first.	Umsebenzi wakho kufuneka ube ngowokuqala.
If you can help please do so.	Ukuba uyakwazi ukunceda nceda wenze njalo.
Do not say another word.	Musa ukuthetha elinye igama.
Have you heard of it ?.	Ukhe weva ngayo?.
We will be in pain again.	Siza kuphinda sibe buhlungu.
A little better.	Ngcono kancinci.
Working, then.	Ukusebenza, ngoko.
All right, all right, all right.	Kulungile, kulungile, kulungile.
Almost that person.	Phantse loo mntu.
This seems to be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi oku kunjalo.
This will probably happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka mhlawumbi.
I definitely think about it a lot.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndicinga ngayo kakhulu.
I need permission.	Ndifuna imvume.
Talking to yourself.	Ukuthetha wedwa.
The talk will definitely go well.	Ngokuqinisekileyo intetho iya kuhamba kakuhle.
Would like to know more.	Ungathanda ukwazi ngakumbi.
He said, too.	Wathi, nam.
But it will be painful for a long, long time.	Kodwa kuya kuba buhlungu ixesha elide, elide.
And then it wasn't good.	Kwaye ke kwakungekho kuhle.
If you do not know then you think not.	Ukuba awuyazi ngoko ucinga ukuba akunjalo.
There is no reason outside.	Akukho sizathu ngaphandle .
He doesn't want her to know.	Akafuni ukuba azi.
I am the problem.	Ndim ingxaki.
And it was not good.	Kwaye kwakungekho kuhle.
I think this will be easier.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuya kuba lula.
I thought, much better.	Ndacinga, ngcono kakhulu.
All this, but he was afraid.	Konke oku, kodwa wayesoyika.
Now he too sat down.	Ngoku naye wahlala phantsi.
The truth is, you know it well.	Inyaniso kukuba, uyazi kakuhle.
Yes, this is all right.	Ewe, yonke le nto ilungile.
I want you to think.	Ndifuna ucinge.
This means you can't do more than that.	Oku kuthetha ukuba awukwazi ukwenza ngaphezu koko.
I had to look away from everything.	Kwafuneka ndijonge kude kuyo yonke into.
I did not go at that time.	Andizange ndiye ngelo xesha.
But you can't stay long.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
He may be behind you.	Usenokuba emva kwakho.
But we are moving forward together.	Kodwa siya phambili kunye.
All my stuff.	Yonke into yam.
To be a man.	Ukuba yindoda.
He said yes to her.	Wathi ewe kuye.
Very large restaurant.	Indawo yokutyela enkulu kakhulu.
He did not know what was happening to him today.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye namhlanje.
However, it really is a must.	Nangona kunjalo, ngokwenene kufuneka.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe nguye lowo.
In a very good way.	Ngendlela entle kakhulu.
Parents and friends.	Abazali kunye nabahlobo.
So, very, very tired.	Ke, kakhulu, ndidiniwe kakhulu.
I'm glad you said something.	Ndiyavuya ukuba uthethe into.
But he would appear sooner or later.	Kodwa wayeza kubonakala kungekudala okanye kamva.
I do not want that to happen to her.	Andifuni yenzeke kuye lonto.
However, we will not.	Nangona kunjalo, asiyi.
I just made a mistake.	Ndenze nje impazamo.
I will say that.	Ndiza kuthetha loo nto.
You can do that now.	Ungayenza loo nto ngoku.
Every time, and after.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, kwaye emva koko.
And here it is.	Kwaye oku apha.
This time there was nothing.	Ngeli xesha kwakungekho nto.
And just that way, he went to it.	Kwaye kanye ngaloo ndlela, waya kuyo.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto .
And they go to work, but not all the time.	Kwaye baya emsebenzini, kodwa hayi lonke ixesha.
I want to read this.	Ndifuna ukufunda le nto.
Really, not at all.	Ngokwenene, akunjalo konke konke.
Let me think about this.	Makhe ndicinge ngale nto.
I forgot one thing though.	Ndilibele into enye kodwa.
But it had to happen in the end.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba kwenzeke ekugqibeleni.
I had to help.	Kwafuneka ndincede.
Three more people.	Abanye abantu abathathu.
Mary does all she can.	UMariya wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
And you are definitely right.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo ulungile.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha kamva.
I need to hear something.	Kufuneka ndive into.
This is exactly what needs to happen.	Yile nto kanye ekufuneka yenzeke.
He seems so at first.	Ubonakala enjalo ekuqaleni.
You will need coffee.	Uya kufuna ikofu.
I will have to learn to see it differently.	Kuya kufuneka ndifunde ukubona ngenye indlela.
Now everything is done.	Ngoku yonke into yenziwe.
Maybe something is there.	Mhlawumbi kukho into apho.
Really tall and tall.	Mde ngenene kwaye mde.
What now? 	Yintoni ngoku?
Now is the time to act.	Ngoku lixesha lokwenza.
That's why you have to go.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka uhambe.
You don't have to do that.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze loo nto.
Nobody says he has to.	Akukho mntu uthi kufuneka enjenjalo.
More will be needed.	Kuya kufuneka ngakumbi.
But even more so now.	Kodwa ngakumbi nangoku.
Alcohol is what he wants.	Utywala yinto ayifunayo.
Do not do that alone.	Musa ukwenza oko wedwa.
It's all bad.	Yinto embi yonke.
I mean something strange to me.	Ndithetha into engaqhelekanga kum.
He never tried that.	Akazange azame oko.
Now, nobody here.	Ngoku, akukho mntu apha.
Everything will be fine!	Konke kuya kuba kuhle!
I will be really easy on this.	Ndiza kuba lula ngokwenene ngale nto.
That's really right.	Ilungile ngokwenene loo nto.
You can't do anything in your area right now.	Awukwazi ukwenza nto kwindawo yakho ngoku.
Do not say anything else.	Musa ukuthetha enye into.
I think it will be strange.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Something very strange is happening here tonight.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga kakhulu eyenzekayo apha ngokuhlwanje.
But you think you know it all.	Kodwa ucinga ukuba uyazi konke.
Also, no one was there for me.	Kwakhona, umntu wayengekho ngenxa yam.
His mother refused.	Umama wakhe akazange avume.
So you have to do your homework.	Ngoko kufuneka wenze umsebenzi wakho wasekhaya.
No one should.	Akukho mntu kufuneka.
Unusual number.	Inombolo engaqhelekanga.
They have stayed because of you.	Baye bahlala ngenxa yakho.
And it is possible.	Kwaye kusenokwenzeka.
Last week.	Kwiveki ephelileyo.
You will definitely find the answer to that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufumana impendulo kuloo nto.
They all said they would do it.	Bonke bathi baya kuyenza.
He came home all night.	Wafika ekhaya ngalo lonke ixesha ebusuku.
But in this case, not so much.	Kodwa kule meko, hayi kakhulu.
I will decide on that soon.	Ndiza kwenza isigqibo ngaloo nto kungekudala.
He stepped back.	Waya ngasemva.
We will be back with you soon.	Siza kubuya nawe kwangoko.
My mother is a person.	Umama wam ngumntu.
Look to do something very good.	Jonga ukwenza into entle kakhulu.
I have to do something to help.	Kufuneka ndenze into ukunceda.
There is a place where this becomes true.	Kukho indawo apho oku kuba yinyani.
You did your job very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu umsebenzi wakho.
Not just yet.	Hayi nje okwangoku.
I also know what happened to you.	Nam ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo kuwe.
That will end.	Oko kuya kuphela.
This is indeed the case, as we shall see.	Oku kunjalo ngokwenene, njengoko siza kubona.
But only about you, it seems to us.	Kodwa kuphela malunga nawe, kubonakala ngathi.
It would be easy to talk to me about it.	Bekuya kuba lula ukuthetha nam kuyo.
Except for me and him.	Ngaphandle kwam naye.
Dad is very thoughtful.	Utata ucinga kakhulu.
But there is a big problem with that.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enkulu kuloo nto.
That takes a long time.	Oko kuthatha ixesha elide.
That's what it says to you.	Yiloo nto ethetha ngayo nawe.
The fact is, it is possible.	Inyaniso kukuba, kusenokwenzeka.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wakwenza oko.
He didn't say much, his wife did.	Akazange athethe kakhulu, umfazi wakhe wathetha.
It just takes reading.	Kuthatha nje ukufunda.
Because they will do it again.	Kuba baya kuyenza kwakhona.
It would be hard for me to leave now.	Bekuya kuba nzima ukuba ndihambe ngoku.
Test.	Uvavanyo .
I really had to go.	Nyani kwafuneka ndihambe.
We will definitely come here again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kuza apha kwakhona.
Yeah, maybe eyes.	Ewe, mhlawumbi amehlo.
A great place to stay for a long time for sure.	Indawo entle yokuhlala ixesha elide ngokuqinisekileyo.
It's a big job all the time.	Ngumsebenzi omkhulu ngalo lonke ixesha.
It will be good to work with you.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukusebenza nawe.
And then we have to do it.	Kwaye ke kufuneka siyenze.
They both sit down quickly.	Bobabini bahlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
We know.	Siyazi .
But no one will ever do that.	Kodwa akukho mntu uya kuze ayenze loo nto.
She decided to tell him.	Wagqiba kwelokuba amxelele.
Because he is interested in us.	Kuba unomdla kuthi.
I think all is well.	Ndicinga ukuba konke kulungile.
That will happen a lot.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kakhulu.
I think she is, really, very beautiful.	Ndicinga ukuba, ngenene, mhle kakhulu.
You also have to be something.	Kwakhona kufuneka ube yinto ethile.
I could not get out.	Khange ndikwazi ukuphuma phandle.
He says everything is fine.	Uthi yonke into ilungile.
This will happen overnight.	Oku kuya kwenzeka ebusuku.
But I'm just tired.	Kodwa ndidiniwe kuphela.
Where dinner.	Apho isidlo sangokuhlwa.
And he is a friend.	Kwaye ngumhlobo.
He had to read.	Kwafuneka afunde.
I will never speak to him again.	Soze ndiphinde ndithethe naye.
But this happened very quickly.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
But this is his elder.	Kodwa lo mdala wakhe.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga ngawe ngalo lonke ixesha .
I also look around the room.	Ndiphinde ndijonge egumbini.
Just playing, being an adult is fine.	Ukudlala nje, ukuba mdala kulungile.
He needed immediate attention.	Wayefuna ingqalelo ngokukhawuleza.
I can die.	Ndiyakwazi ukufa.
Not yet, but you will know soon.	Hayi okwangoku, kodwa uya kukwazi kungekudala.
He saw his friends.	Wabona abahlobo bakhe.
And no money.	Kwaye akukho mali.
If it is true, it is true.	Ukuba yinyani, yinyani.
As you are here.	Njengokuba ulapha.
I'm glad for you.	Ndiyavuya kuba wena.
Next week, next month.	Kwiveki ezayo, kwinyanga ezayo.
And then some.	Kwaye ke abanye.
So, no problem for me.	Ngoko, akukho ngxaki kum.
However, the reason is,.	Kodwa ke, isizathu, .
There are a few more.	Kukho ezinye ezimbalwa.
I knew you could do it.	Bendisazi ukuba ungayenza.
No, what.	Hayi, yintoni na.
You always work, you go.	Uhlala usebenza, uhamba.
But other than that, it is not.	Kodwa ngaphandle koko, akunjalo.
New truth.	Inyaniso entsha.
I can't, he thought, stay here.	Andikwazi, wacinga, ukuhlala apha.
But he certainly seems that way to me.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo ubonakala enjalo kum.
I did not stay.	Andizange ndihlale.
Or the passage of time.	Okanye ukuhamba kwexesha.
I wanted to play.	Ndandifuna ukudlala.
Moreover it is much better.	Ngaphezu koko kungcono ngakumbi.
This is far enough as it is.	Oku kude ngokwaneleyo njengoko kunjalo.
She learns more on her own.	Ufunda ngakumbi eyedwa.
I know you would love it very much.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungathanda kakhulu kuye.
Not before I saw him again.	Hayi ngaphambi kokuba ndimbone kwakhona.
This will probably not be the case.	Oku mhlawumbi akuyi kuba yinto eyenzekayo.
And it seems to be more so now.	Kwaye kubonakala kunjalo ngakumbi ngoku.
Another big mistake.	Enye impazamo enkulu.
He has done our job.	Wenze umsebenzi wethu.
It just has to be successful.	Kufuneka nje ukuphumelela.
But nothing really.	Kodwa akukho nto ngokwenene.
There is a dog.	Kukho inja.
Great question.	Umbuzo omkhulu.
I should have thought this way before.	Bekufanele ndicinge ngale ndlela ngaphambili.
You just have to know where you are looking and how.	Kufuneka nje wazi ukuba ujonge phi kwaye njani.
But then again, maybe that's the problem.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi nantso ingxaki.
Everyone knew this was coming.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba oku kuza.
Just like then.	Kanye njengokuba ngoko.
He didn't want to talk like that.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha njalo.
Not a cat but.	Hayi ikati kodwa.
I would like to go the other way.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba ngenye indlela.
He saw things.	Wabona izinto.
That can be difficult to do.	Oko kunokuba nzima ukwenza.
So it was good.	Ngoko kube kuhle.
So why ??.	Khona kutheni??.
And he learned a lot, too.	Kwaye wafunda okuninzi, naye.
Or a dog.	Okanye inja.
If anyone looks no.	Ukuba nabani na ujonge hayi.
That's right, yes, that's right.	Kunjalo, ewe, kunjalo.
Or something strange will happen.	Okanye into engaqhelekanga iya kwenzeka.
He knew about it, of course.	Wayesazi ngayo, kunjalo.
But really, really, really.	Kodwa ngenene, ngenene, ngenene .
I want you better.	Ndifuna wena ngcono.
He loves death.	Uthanda ukufa.
But not now, not at this time.	Kodwa hayi ngoku, hayi ngeli xesha.
He knew this was hard.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kunzima.
He says it could be himself.	Uthi inokuba nguye ngokwakhe.
He had to make a mistake.	Kwafuneka enze impazamo.
The doctor out here.	Ugqirha apha phandle.
But there is something about you.	Kodwa kukho into ngawe.
Everyone wants to be here.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
But within that possibility, there is a place to live.	Kodwa ngaphakathi koko kunokwenzeka, kukho indawo yokuhlala.
I knew it would be hard today.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima namhlanje.
I never thought of anyone or anything.	Khange ndicinge mntu okanye nantoni na.
I hope you do not want to.	Ndiyathemba ukuba awufuni.
I want you all the time.	Ndifuna wena ngalo lonke ixesha.
But you are thinking well.	Kodwa ucinga kakuhle.
After that, he could not walk without help.	Emva koko, akazange akwazi ukuhamba ngaphandle koncedo.
Almost no one has it.	Phantse akukho mntu unayo.
So stop being sad.	Ngoko ke yeka ukuba buhlungu.
Where did he go, what did he do.	Ukuba waya phi, wenza ntoni.
And he does it a lot.	Kwaye uyenza kakhulu.
I've already said a lot.	Sele ndithethe kakhulu.
He thought he had better go.	Wacinga ukuba kungcono ahambe.
Or you hurt.	Okanye wena buhlungu.
You have a place to stay there.	Unayo indawo yokuhlala apho.
I will be here for you.	Ndiza kuba apha ngenxa yakho.
Because then it's work.	Kuba ke ngumsebenzi.
He knew it now or never happened.	Wayesazi ukuba ngoku okanye akuzange kwenzeke.
My father? 	Utata wam?
People will start talking about us.	Abantu baya kuqala ukuthetha ngathi.
I have never heard anyone do that before.	Andizange ndive nabani na esenza loo nto ngaphambili.
Now he is determined.	Ngoku uzimisele.
And now it is.	Kwaye ngoku kunjalo.
My turn.	Ixesha lam.
Now what are we going to do with it.	Ngoku siza kwenza ntoni ngayo.
You probably thought.	Mhlawumbi wacinga.
It seems like a small thing.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto encinci.
Whatever comes first.	Nantoni na eza kuqala.
It will be easy, then.	Kuya kuba lula, emva koko.
He doesn't have to know.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba azi.
He asked if she should go home.	Wabuza ukuba kufuneka agoduke na.
It's hard, when he wants hard.	Kunzima, xa efuna nzima.
But, he does.	Kodwa, uyayenza.
And now this.	Ke ngoku oku.
Let me tell you, it was not easy.	Makhe ndikuxelele, kwakungekho lula.
He left yesterday.	Uye wahamba izolo.
But this certainly will not do.	Kodwa oku ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kwenza.
He wants to be.	Ufuna ukuba .
And so he was afraid to stay with her.	Kwaye ke wayesoyika ukuhlala naye.
If you are willing to do anything, you will get something.	Ukuba uzimisele ukwenza nantoni na, uya kufumana into.
Maybe it’s me, or it’s just me.	Mhlawumbi ndim, okanye ndim nje.
I just heard something.	Ndive nje into.
And here I am.	Kwaye ndilapha.
But don't make it too easy.	Kodwa musa ukuyenza lula kakhulu.
Most of the time alone.	Ixesha elininzi wedwa.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni.
He wants to be with me, all the time.	Ufuna ukuba nam, ngalo lonke ixesha.
But he just succeeded.	Kodwa uphumelele nje.
He would see that in the morning.	Wayeza kubona ngaloo nto kusasa.
I hope all goes well for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kuhamba kakuhle kuwe .
Maybe something is wrong with me.	Mhlawumbi kukho into engalunganga ngam.
You must come and stay with me.	Kufuneka uze kuhlala nam.
Prolonged hospital stay.	Ukuhlala ixesha elide esibhedlele.
I will stay with him here.	Ndiza kuhlala naye apha.
His wife died.	Umfazi wakhe wafa.
He left shortly thereafter.	Wemka kungekudala emva koko.
I wanted to do it right.	Bendifuna ukuyenza kakuhle.
She left him.	Wemka kuye.
And he will do this with me.	Kwaye uza kwenza oku kunye nam.
Much is impossible.	Okuninzi akunakwenzeka.
Your daughter will be back.	Uya kubuya intombi yakho.
That's you.	Nguwe ke.
It has to happen to you.	Kufuneka yenzeke kuwe.
He thought he knew he had it.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi ukuba unayo.
He travels everything.	Uhamba yonke into.
But, well, it's okay to go.	Kodwa, kulungile, kulungile ukuhamba.
To him, maybe, but not me.	Kuye, mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi mna.
I know you have to look at me.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka ujonge kum.
One is sitting down.	Omnye uhleli phantsi.
But anyone can do that.	Kodwa nabani na angayenza loo nto.
We all want to play every day.	Sonke sifuna ukudlala yonke imihla.
Then he made a mistake.	Emva koko wenza impazamo.
I did something.	Ndiyenzile into.
But it is done now.	Kodwa yenziwe ngoku.
Not until everything is done.	Hayi de yonke into yenziwe.
You can do it, you just don't want to.	Ungayenza, awufuni nje.
He said he liked it very much.	Uthe uyayithanda kakhulu.
He has to try to think.	Kufuneka azame ukucinga.
We will do the same.	Siya kwenza njalo.
He certainly knew nothing about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengazi nto ngayo.
There is no one but him.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
So, the answer is, you can't.	Ngoko, impendulo kukuba, awukwazi.
She has been hurt.	Uye waba buhlungu.
So what exactly is that.	Ke yintoni leyo kanye.
But if you have to come to me.	Kodwa ukuba kufuneka uze kum .
I have no place without you.	Andikho ndawo ngaphandle kwakho.
You are afraid of something.	Woyika into.
So how do you do it.	Ngoko wenza njani.
But he was not very high.	Kodwa wayengekho phezulu kakhulu.
You should have known this was going to happen.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
Dad can't read music.	Utata akakwazi ukufunda umculo.
He felt strange.	Waziva engaqhelekanga.
It’s hard and it’s hard.	Kunzima kwaye kunzima.
He kept saying something.	Waqhubeka ethetha into.
After that, he plans to quit.	Emva koko, uceba ukuyeka.
I don't want to say it.	Andifuni ukuyithetha.
Then one knows for sure.	Emva koko umntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
That one is very visible.	Lowo ubonakala kakhulu.
Then he came to her.	Emva koko weza kuye.
You already know the answer to everything.	Sele uyazi impendulo kuyo yonke into.
You have become my friend.	Ube ngumhlobo wam.
You just have it.	Unayo nje.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha kukwazi nje.
He lived in his car.	Wayehlala emotweni yakhe.
That was obvious.	Oko kwakubonakala .
I've been thinking about it for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngayo.
If you are smart.	Ukuba ukrelekrele.
I want him to tell me no.	Ndifuna andixelele ukuba hayi.
Because in the end.	Ngenxa yokuba ekugqibeleni.
But he did not think.	Kodwa akazange acinge .
And this song is made with it.	Kwaye le ngoma yenziwe nayo.
And you certainly can.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo unokuba njalo.
Then, finally, you do it.	Emva koko, ekugqibeleni, uyayenza.
Finally he checked the time.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga ixesha.
But he will do it.	Kodwa uya kuyenza.
That must have been a long time ago.	Oko kumele ukuba kube kudala .
Maybe not, but it seems to us.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, kodwa kubonakala ngathi.
But no one is interested.	Kodwa akukho mntu unomdla.
Good enough, really.	Kuhle ngokwaneleyo, ngokwenene.
But really, yes.	Kodwa ngokwenene, ewe.
It's just a matter of when.	Yinto nje yokuba nini.
He was able to make coffee.	Ikofu wakwazi ukuyenza.
You will be fine with it.	Uya kuba ulungile kuyo.
He does not know alone.	Akazi yedwa.
And it can be harder than it seems.	Kwaye kunokuba nzima kunokuba kubonakala.
But then again, you know this.	Kodwa kwakhona, uyazi oku.
But, it is not possible.	Kodwa, akunakwenzeka.
Previously, he was not angry.	Ngaphambili, akazange abe nomsindo.
Clearly, it could be.	Ngokucacileyo, kunokuba njalo.
Yes, certainly yes.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo ewe.
He tried to figure out where he was.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba uphi.
She won then.	Uphumelele ke.
I see my father.	Ndabona utata.
What happened to him ?.	Kwenzeke ntoni kuye?.
He also knew about it.	Naye wayesazi ngayo.
And you should not be.	Kwaye akufanele ube.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Akazange athethe nto ixesha elide.
That's hard when one does that.	Oko kunzima xa umntu esenza ngolo hlobo.
I could not.	Khange ndikwazi.
Not at first, of course.	Hayi ekuqaleni, kunjalo.
This will end badly.	Oku kuya kuphela kakubi.
I think he can do everything.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza yonke into.
I doubt and look.	Ndiyathandabuza kwaye ndijonge.
Maybe he went too far.	Mhlawumbi waya kakhulu.
I wanted to go.	Bendifuna ukuhamba.
He is lying there with her.	Ulele naye apho.
Again, his mind.	Kwakhona, ingqondo yakhe.
And it could be better.	Kwaye inokuba ngcono.
He looked at me.	Wajonga wajonga kum.
He didn't say much, though.	Khange athethe kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
It could be years.	Inokuba iminyaka.
I would really like to know.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukwazi.
He finished quickly.	Wagqiba ngokukhawuleza.
It really does mean that, whatever happens will happen.	Ngokwenene kuthetha ukuba, nantoni na eyenzekayo iya kwenzeka.
But he could not restrain himself from going.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuzibamba ukuba ahambe.
I really thought that.	Ngokwenene ndacinga ukuba.
To me this means everything.	Kum oku kuthetha yonke into.
Is one right for you.	Ngaba enye ilungile kuwe.
I certainly know more now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyazi ngakumbi ngoku.
There is nothing behind me.	Akukho nto emva kwam.
I did not go away.	khange ndihambe ndihambe.
And maybe not so quickly.	Kwaye mhlawumbi hayi ngokukhawuleza.
If anything.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na.
Whenever you are ready.	Nanini na xa ulungile.
Unless it should have been.	Ngaphandle kokuba bekungafanelanga ukuba kube njalo.
And you will see your parents.	Kwaye uza kubona abazali bakho.
And that's exactly right.	Kwaye kunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
I think it's weird but whatever it is.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga kodwa nokuba yintoni na.
I, by the way.	Ndim, ngendlela.
I had a really good time.	Ndenze ixesha elihle kakhulu.
I'll be back, not now.	Ndiza kubuya, hayi ngoku.
We'll see this.	Siza kubona oku.
I never thought about it before.	Ndandingacingi ngayo ngaphambili.
And not just to talk about it.	Kwaye hayi nje ukuthetha ngayo.
I never said otherwise.	Andizange ndithethe ngenye indlela.
I'm not really there.	Andikho nyani apho.
I made my own coffee.	Ndenze ikofu yam.
I went to him.	Ndiye ndaya kuye.
We are well aware of that.	Siyazi kakuhle loo nto.
We will never know a thing.	Soze siyazi into.
Not long after that.	Hayi ixesha elide emva koko.
But not about me.	Kodwa akukho ngam.
You absolutely deserve it.	Ufanele ngokupheleleyo.
But he is real.	Kodwa ngokwenene ukhona.
And it was not really necessary.	Kwaye kwakungeyomfuneko ngokwenene.
That is not what he wants.	Asiyonto ayifunayo leyo.
If you do, that's fine.	Ukuba wenza, kulungile.
Or tell me.	Okanye undixelele.
Just look at things.	Jonga nje izinto.
You have already done enough.	Sele wenze ngokwaneleyo.
Impossible to operate.	Akunakwenzeka ukusebenza .
And your children.	Kwaye abantwana bakho.
You came here for work.	Uze apha ngomsebenzi.
His work is very good.	Mhle kakhulu umsebenzi wakhe.
After my time though.	Emva kwexesha lam kodwa.
So maybe it wasn’t.	Ngoko mhlawumbi yayingenguye.
Well done and thank you.	Uhambe kakuhle kwaye enkosi.
I’m happy to be out of there right away and fast.	Ndiyavuya ukuphuma apho kwangoko kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
The big man came out at night.	Umntu omkhulu waphuma ebusuku.
Who do you think will win ?.	Ucinga ukuba ngubani oza kuphumelela?.
You have to do some work at home.	Kufuneka wenze omnye umsebenzi ekhaya.
Either way this is better.	Ngenye indlela oku kungcono.
Nobody knew he was here.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba ulapha.
I should have done the right thing.	Bekufanele ukuba ndenza into elungileyo.
And now, tonight.	Kwaye ngoku, ngokuhlwanje.
There is a problem with this method.	Kukho ingxaki ngale ndlela.
But it has to be better.	Kodwa kufuneka kube ngcono.
He got a phone call.	Wafumana ifowuni.
This means it is good.	Oku kuthetha ukuba kuhle.
You will have to look further.	Kuya kufuneka ujonge ngakumbi.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo enye.
People will make a decision.	Abantu baya kwenza isigqibo.
You will find someone else.	Uza kufumana omnye umntu.
He did not go today.	Akazange namhlanje.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa akazange afune.
Then for breakfast.	Emva koko kwisidlo sakusasa.
Not just good enough.	Hayi nje kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
He came and tried to talk to me again.	Weza waza wazama ukuthetha nam kwakhona.
He ran to his car.	Wabaleka ukuya emotweni yakhe.
We want it this way.	Sifuna ngale ndlela.
I can do it later.	Ndingayenza kamva.
One, no.	Enye, hayi.
And angry again.	Kwaye nomsindo kwakhona.
To me, just like me.	Kum, njengam.
It seemed good to me.	Kwakubonakala kulungile kum.
Others live together.	Abanye bahlala kunye.
I really think it will.	Ngokwenene ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
However, that should not be the case now.	Nangona kunjalo, oko akufuneki kube ngoku.
However, not exactly.	Nangona kunjalo, hayi kakuhle.
He wanted to find his people.	Wayefuna ukufumana abantu bakhe.
So you have to go with it.	Ngoko kufuneka uhambe nayo.
I never thought it would be good.	Khange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba kuhle.
It takes up a lot of space.	Kuthatha indawo eninzi.
This time, he said yes.	Ngeli xesha, wathi ewe.
I thought you were good now, or better, anyway.	Bendicinga ukuba ulungile ngoku, okanye ungcono, kunjalo.
I could not do better.	Andikwazanga ukwenza ngcono.
Very alone.	Kakhulu wedwa.
I do not want you to be far away.	Andifuni uhlale kude.
But it's hard, you know, for now.	Kodwa kunzima, uyazi, okwangoku.
He left home.	Wemka ekhaya.
I love this place for lunch.	Ndiyayithanda le ndawo ngesidlo sasemini.
That would mean.	Oko bekuya kuthetha.
You work every time you work.	Usebenza ngalo lonke ixesha usebenza.
This will happen soon.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
I deserve to be there.	Ndifanele ukuba lapho.
In his absence.	Xa engekho.
I can not do as you like.	Andikwazi ukwenza njengoko uthanda.
It all has to build something big in the end.	Yonke kufuneka yakhe into enkulu ekugqibeleni.
He looked at his house.	Wajonga endlwini yakhe.
And it happened in the end.	Kwaye kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
I think you will see why.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kubona ukuba kutheni.
He sat down very quietly.	Wahlala phantsi kakhulu.
Definitely, great answer.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, impendulo enkulu.
I do not know where it is going.	Andazi apho iya khona.
This is exactly where you want to be.	Yile ndawo kanye ufuna ukuba kuyo.
Nothing, except one.	Akukho nto, ngaphandle komnye.
He knew in advance.	Wayesazi ngaphambili.
And he did and he did.	Kwaye wenza kwaye wenza.
I would like to find someone.	Ndingathanda ukufumana umntu.
This time, it will be better.	Ngeli xesha, kuya kuba ngcono.
He looked back and saw his gun.	Wajonga ngasemva, wabona umpu wakhe.
There is only your way.	Kukho indlela yakho kuphela.
Well, don't tell people that.	Kulungile, musa ukuxelela abantu loo nto.
Now there are many.	Ngoku kukho ezininzi.
I didn't want to know anything.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi nto.
How about another? 	Njani enye?
You will not always win.	Awuyi kuphumelela lonke ixesha.
So do I.	Kunjalo ke nam.
But this happened to me.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka kum.
Tom did not come.	UTom akazange eze.
All right, then.	Kulungile, ngoko ke.
He fled and got into his car.	Wabaleka wangena emotweni yakhe.
I totally apologize.	Ndicela uxolo ngokupheleleyo.
The answer is probably yes, maybe no.	Impendulo mhlawumbi ewe, mhlawumbi hayi.
I am the only one, the only one.	Ndim kuphela, ndim kuphela.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu oko.
I don't even know how this happened.	Andazi nokuba kwenzeka njani oku.
It would take his place.	Bekuya kuthatha indawo yakhe.
No matter how long you want it.	Nokuba ufuna ixesha elide kangakanani.
And one more thing.	Kwaye into enye kwakhona.
And to do better.	Kwaye ukwenza ngcono.
Why are we here.	Kutheni siza apha.
It has been so much easier to work together.	Kube lula kakhulu ukusebenza kunye.
Now it is something new.	Ngoku yinto entsha.
Yes, almost always.	Ewe, phantse rhoqo.
I need to speak well of this now.	Kufuneka ndithethe kakuhle ngale nto ngoku.
It will be easier than you think.	Kuya kuba lula kunokuba ucinga.
He started stealing food.	Waqalisa ukuba ukutya.
We know more.	Siyazi ngakumbi.
I look forward, backward.	Ndijonge phambili, ngasemva.
I will come now.	Ndiza kuza ngoku.
He means everything.	Uthetha yonke into.
I think before you win, okay.	Ndicinga ukuba ngaphambi kokuba uphumelele, kulungile.
He gave me something about it.	Wandinika into ngayo.
We will do it again.	Siza kuphinda.
Now, really.	Ngoku, ngokwenene.
So you don't want to.	Ngoko awufuni.
It is not necessary at all.	Akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
But there is a big truth.	Kodwa kukho inyaniso enkulu.
One father.	Utata omnye.
You are the person now.	Nguwe lo mntu ngoku.
Today you may know more about this.	Namhlanje usenokuba uyazi ngakumbi oku.
He came here in front of me.	Ufike apha phambi kwam.
Today, it will be much better.	Namhlanje, kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
But you should not be here.	Kodwa akufanele ube lapha.
And no one is going to do it.	Kwaye akukho mntu uya kwenza.
I certainly did not want to do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
You have to tell me that place.	Kufuneka undixelele loo ndawo.
It should not have been so difficult.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba kube nzima ngolo hlobo.
I have to think about work.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngomsebenzi.
Dad says he should come regularly.	Utata uthi kufuneka eze rhoqo.
We don't have to make a decision tonight.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba senze isigqibo ngokuhlwanje.
He said he would like to.	Wathi angathanda.
And he knew everyone.	Kwaye wayesazi wonke umntu.
He must be much taller than me.	Kufuneka abe mde kakhulu kunam.
Obviously, you may be working all the time.	Ngokucacileyo, unokuba usebenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
Yes thinking is right.	Ewe ukucinga kulungile.
I think it's his time.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha lakhe.
Just a big ball.	Ibhola nje enkulu.
I think that's a better thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto engcono.
If not, you will do it alone.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kuyenza yedwa.
Not just our age, every age.	Hayi nje iminyaka yethu, yonke iminyaka.
Without him, it would be difficult.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kunokuba nzima.
You mean the same thing.	Uthetha into enye.
I wish someone would tell me this soon.	Akwaba umntu undixelele le nto ngokukhawuleza.
I can't say anything to anyone.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na kuye nabani na.
I don't see a problem.	Andiboni ingxaki.
I'm sure he is.	Ndiqinisekile nguye.
I never thought he knew this.	Zange ndicinge ukuba uyakwazi oku.
Hope to see you soon!.	Ndinqwenela ukubona!.
I made a mistake, bad.	Ndenze impazamo, embi.
This is definitely a good thing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo le yinto entle.
We all know that it is not easy.	Sonke siyazi ukuba akukho lula.
But not then.	Kodwa hayi ngelo xesha.
You have to be, because you are.	Kufuneka ube yiyo, kuba nguwe.
It is almost impossible to walk.	Phantse akunakwenzeka ukuhamba.
And then there's your little girl.	Kwaye ke kukho intombi yakho encinci.
If something happens to him.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuye .
Everyone will want to know what happened.	Wonke umntu uya kufuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
It takes more time.	Kuthatha ixesha elingakumbi.
Sit down.	Uhlale phantsi.
So much to see !.	Kakhulu ukubona!.
Nobody wanted to talk to you.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nawe.
That, of course, will go a long way.	Oko, kunjalo, kuya kude kakhulu.
You must be ready to do that.	Umele ukulungele ukwenjenjalo.
Finally, of course, he came out on top.	Ekugqibeleni, ngokuqinisekileyo, waphuma phezulu.
He would definitely love to work here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo angathanda ukusebenza apha.
Where are we going? 	Apho siya khona?
Indeed, this is possible.	Ngokwenene, oku kunokwenzeka.
It has to be a toy.	Kumele kube yinto yokudlala.
Questions are a good thing.	Imibuzo yinto entle.
I thought about it for a while.	Ndikhe ndacinga ngolu hlobo nje kancinci.
And then he said yes, that's right.	Kwaye ke wathi ewe, kunjalo.
Yes, you want hard.	Ewe, ufuna nzima.
They will be your dog.	Baya kuba inja yakho.
She is going to college.	Uya ekholejini.
You know what the other person thinks.	Uyazi ukuba omnye ucinga ntoni.
I wanted to know.	Bendifuna ukwazi.
Made with money.	Yenziwe ngemali.
Besides, he is too old for you.	Ngaphandle koko, mdala kakhulu kuwe.
Or not about.	Okanye hayi malunga .
This is good, fast reading.	Oku kuhle, ukufunda ngokukhawuleza.
You just want anything you want in your room.	Ufuna nje nantoni na ofuna ukuba nayo kwigumbi lakho.
How do you do that.	Uyenza njani loo nto.
He walked in front of me.	Wahamba phambi kwam.
It will take money.	Kuya kuthatha imali.
You love it, and you have it so much.	Uyayithanda, kwaye unayo kakhulu.
I am very local.	Ndingumntu wasekhaya kakhulu.
I hope all is well !.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kulungile!.
Wife first, friends otherwise back.	Umfazi kuqala, abahlobo ngenye indlela emva.
Well that makes one person.	Kulungile oko kwenza umntu omnye.
But stay and wait.	Kodwa ukuhlala kwaye ulinde.
Something terrible has happened again.	Kukho into embi eyenzekileyo kwakhona.
But we will talk about it later.	Kodwa siza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
But he will never know.	Kodwa soze azi.
Then he will return.	Emva koko uya kubuya.
You can't decide which one.	Awukwazi ukugqiba ukuba yeyiphi.
That means you are really good.	Oko kuthetha ukuba ulungile ngokwenene.
Something about anything.	Into malunga nantoni.
Or, you know, almost pretty.	Okanye, uyazi, phantse mhle.
I will do well.	Ndiya kwenza kakuhle.
No no, not at this time.	Hayi hayi, hayi ngeli xesha.
You need a doctor here.	Ufuna ugqirha apha.
I could not make anything happen.	Andikwazanga ukwenza nantoni na ukuba yenzeke.
This is what we all need to do.	Yile nto sonke ekufuneka siyenze.
Better, but not better.	Ngcono, kodwa hayi kakuhle.
He lives up there.	Uhlala phaya phezulu.
You always do that.	Uhlala uyenza loo nto.
Very, of course.	Kakhulu, kunjalo.
Don't do it.	Musa ukwenza.
Do you feel that way now ?.	Uziva njalo ngoku?.
Other than that, it goes well.	Ngaphandle koko, kuhamba kakuhle.
I was hoping he would tell the truth.	Bendinethemba lokuba uya kuthetha inyani.
I can do it right away.	Ndingayenza kwangoko.
Well, he did not speak.	Ewe, akazange athethe.
We all know that it is true.	Sonke siyazi ukuba yinyani.
Everyone will stay there.	Wonke umntu uya kuhlala apho.
Now, we really have to make a decision.	Ngoku, kufuneka ngokwenene senze isigqibo.
He too looked down.	Naye wajonga phantsi.
He pulled everyone out.	Wakhupha wonke umntu.
I better do something.	Kungcono ndenze into.
And, yes, that is possible.	Kwaye, ewe, oko kunokwenzeka.
Something that makes you, you.	Into ekwenza wena, wena.
Yes he would.	Ewe wayeza kuya.
We both did.	Senze sobabini ke.
Yeah, you made a number for him, okay.	Ewe, wenze inombolo kuye, kulungile.
I know how to do my job.	Ndiyazi ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
You certainly will not do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awuyi kuyenza.
He stepped down.	Wangena phantsi.
And this will eventually happen.	Kwaye oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
But look at my coat.	Kodwa jonga idyasi yam.
He started all my work.	Waqalisa umsebenzi wam wonke.
You know what.	Uyazi yintoni.
That's the way to become better.	Yiloo ndlela yokuba ngcono.
I'll go for a better one.	Ndiza kuhamba enye engcono.
You can't work.	Awukwazi ukusebenza.
He said he works hard at it.	Uthe usebenza nzima kuyo.
And there are police.	Kwaye kukho amapolisa.
He learned to drive.	Wafunda ukuqhuba.
But this is a good thing.	Kodwa le yinto entle.
So, well.	Ngoko, kakuhle.
This is hard, for me.	Oku kunzima, kum.
And buy enough days.	Kwaye ukuthenga ngokwaneleyo iintsuku.
You better go and.	Kungcono uhambe kwaye.
He was afraid of what would happen next.	Wayesoyika ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
He realized he needed help.	Waqonda ukuba ufuna uncedo.
You have to think again.	Kufuneka ucinge kwakhona.
He is also tired.	Naye udiniwe.
Eventually he started to succeed.	Ekugqibeleni waqalisa ukuphumelela.
Obviously it did not happen.	Ngokucacileyo akuzange kwenzeke.
You have to look at his location.	Kufuneka ujonge indawo yakhe.
Probably no one should do it the way he did.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu ufanele ukuba enze ngale ndlela enze ngayo.
I tried my best in class.	Ndazama ndizama eklasini.
It will all happen tomorrow.	Konke kuya kwenzeka ngomso.
Either way will take a very long time.	Nayiphi na indlela iya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
You have made it difficult.	Wenze nzima.
I certainly think so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndicinga ukuba kunjalo.
To me or to him.	Kum okanye kuye.
Getting here before breakfast.	Ukufika apha phambi kwesidlo sakusasa.
And maybe right.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ilungile.
Not in your car.	Hayi emotweni yakho.
I desperately wanted you to be real.	Ndandifuna kakubi ukuba ube yinyani.
But it is very unlikely though.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka kakhulu nangona kunjalo.
I'm sure you know too.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi nawe.
How would you like to help.	Ungathanda ukunceda njani.
That's a lot of ways.	Nantso indlela ezininzi.
It's great to see this.	Kuhle kakhulu ukubona oku.
No one wanted to talk to us.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nathi.
You think about that.	Ucinga ngaloo nto.
This is what I do at home, no one knows about it.	Le nto ndiyenza ekhaya, akukho mntu uyazi ngayo.
He wanted to see inside.	Wayefuna ukubona ngaphakathi.
I brought it all.	Ndize nayo yonke.
Travel is even more difficult today.	Ukuhamba kunzima ngakumbi namhlanje.
I don't remember much about it, to be honest.	Andikhumbuli kakhulu ngayo, xa ndithetha inyani.
Maybe you will, maybe you will not.	Mhlawumbi uya kwenza, mhlawumbi awuyi.
Therefore, this question will succeed.	Ngoko ke, lo mbuzo uya kuphumelela.
And now she was living with him.	Kwaye ngoku wayehlala naye.
Slowly, he took his gift.	Kancinci, wathatha isipho sakhe.
Yes, this is happening with my children.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka nabantwana bam.
You just want to do it your way.	Ufuna nje ukwenza ngendlela yakho.
You came to feel it.	Ufike waziva .
He said that it really did.	Wathi ngokwenene kunjalo.
He thought maybe.	Wayecinga mhlawumbi .
You think something is wrong.	Ucinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
But in a better way.	Kodwa ngendlela engcono.
Maybe you speak well of your approach.	Mhlawumbi uthetha kakuhle ngendlela yakho.
He went two.	Wahamba ezimbini.
I don't remember there being a problem with that.	Andikhumbuli kukho ingxaki kuloo nto.
But lately, it has come down dramatically.	Kodwa mva nje, uye wehla kakhulu.
Maybe someone will do that.	Mhlawumbi umntu uya kwenza njalo.
Just maybe.	Kanye kanye mhlawumbi.
I would, of course.	Ndingathanda, kunjalo.
Right there in his office.	Kanye apho eofisini yakhe.
More than enough to know what it takes.	Ngaphezu koko ngokwaneleyo ukwazi oko kuthatha.
Also for being very beautiful.	Kwakhona ngokuba mhle kakhulu.
He will always be alone with him.	Uya kuhlala uhleli kuye yedwa.
I'll go with him on that.	Ndiza kuhamba naye ngaloo nto.
I tried another time, if possible.	Ndazama elinye ixesha, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
There is something very new about this.	Kukho into entsha kakhulu kule nto.
I've been thinking about you.	Ndikhe ndacinga ngawe.
We'll see now how successful you are.	Siza kubona ngoku ukuba uphumelele njani.
He did or did not do anything.	Wenze okanye akenzanga nto.
To us this is clear.	Kuthi oku kucacile.
Many days, he is.	Iintsuku ezininzi, nguye.
Like, not every day.	Njengoko, hayi yonke imihla.
Not too much, not too little.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kancinci.
But now we know all about him.	Kodwa ngoku siyazi konke ngaye.
I have to do some things.	Kufuneka ndenze ezinye izinto.
I certainly hope this is the case.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyathemba ukuba oku kunjalo.
He stayed too long in his room.	Wahlala kakhulu egumbini lakhe.
He didn't think anything of it.	Wayengacingi nto ngaloo nto.
So in that case.	Ngoko xa kunjalo.
This has happened before.	Kwakhe kwenzeka ngolo hlobo ngaphambili.
See answer here.	Jonga impendulo apha.
I saw something else, too.	Ndabona enye into, nam.
If there is, the car will move.	Ukuba kukho, imoto iya kuhamba.
He will have to say the word a few times.	Kuya kufuneka athethe igama izihlandlo ezimbalwa.
Only a week or two.	Kuphela iveki okanye ezimbini.
Maybe he didn't know anything at all.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi nto kwaphela.
We do not have to do this every day.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba siyenze yonke imihla.
I learned something today.	Ndifunde into namhlanje.
You learn things faster as you go.	Ufunda izinto ngokukhawuleza njengoko uhamba.
This is much harder than it seems to us.	Oku kunzima kakhulu kunokuba kubonakala ngathi.
He said he was very scared.	Wathi wayesoyika kakhulu.
You do not know the location.	Awuyazi indawo.
That would be a wonderful thing.	Iya kuba yinto entle kakhulu leyo.
Except for me clearly.	Ngaphandle kwam ngokucacileyo.
I made a lot of money.	Ndenze imali eninzi kakhulu.
But that will not happen now.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka ngoku.
Only you.	Kuphela nje wena.
Without being in a bad way.	Ngaphandle kokuba ngendlela embi.
Something he managed to do.	Into aphumelele ukuyenza.
I can't wait to go !.	Andikwazi ukulinda ukuhamba!.
Suddenly, she looked back at him.	Kwangoko, wajonga ngasemva kuye.
What could be her problem, she wondered.	Inokuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe, wazibuza.
As it may be only me.	Njengoko inokuba ndim kuphela.
Just a question about your job.	Umbuzo nje ngomsebenzi wakho.
You need to bring him regularly.	Kufuneka uze naye rhoqo.
Yes that.	Ewe oko.
He never came, though.	Akazange afike, nangona kunjalo.
To me, really.	Kum, ngokwenene.
Everything will be much easier.	Yonke into iya kuba lula kakhulu.
I don't want to say that.	Andifuni ukuyithetha loo nto.
We never did such a thing.	Asizange senze into enjalo.
It will definitely come back this way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo iya kubuya ngolu hlobo.
Just a bad thing.	Into embi nje.
I don't want to try again.	Andifuni kuzama kwakhona.
There is no reason for you to be there.	Akukho sizathu sokuba ube lapho.
It would definitely be better for him here.	Ngenene bekuya kuba ngcono kuye apha.
The problem is that it is far away.	Ingxaki yile yokuba kude.
Certainly, they will say so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, baya kuthetha njalo.
He died later that afternoon.	Wafa kamva ngaloo mvakwemini.
He wants to go home.	Ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
We will go to work soon.	Siza kuya emsebenzini kwangoko.
Maybe one day soon.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini kungekudala.
But to be honest, it has never happened to me before.	Kodwa xa ndithetha inyani, ayizange yenzeke loo nto kum ngaphambili.
That's almost everything you need to know.	Phantse yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyazi.
I have traveled a lot lately.	Ndihambe kakhulu mva nje.
I'll be there!.	Ndiza kuba lapho!.
She has gone out to school.	Uye waphuma waya esikolweni.
I told him maybe later.	Ndamxelela mhlawumbi kamva.
You said the same thing.	Uthethe into enye kanye.
He told her so.	Wamxelela njalo.
This will be more difficult than he thought.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kunokuba wayecinga.
I learned more.	Ndifunde ngakumbi.
It’s really hard to say what happened.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukuthetha ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
And a new dad.	Kwaye utata omtsha.
Well, no problem, though today.	Kulungile, akukho ngxaki, nangona kunjalo namhlanje.
No one should do that.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze njalo.
It seems to be going well.	Kubonakala ngathi kuhamba ngcono.
He said he did not want to.	Wathi akafuni.
Maybe a dog or a cat.	Mhlawumbi inja okanye ikati.
I would love you very much.	Ndingathanda kakhulu kuwe.
You're ready.	Ukulungele.
It won't hurt anything.	Akuyi kuba buhlungu nantoni na.
Now, though.	Ngoku, nangona .
We have done this far.	Senze oku kude.
Your attention, please.	Ingqalelo yakho, nceda.
Nobody works that way.	Akukho mntu usebenza ngaloo ndlela.
Not that no one has tried it before.	Akunjalo ukuba akukho mntu wazama ngaphambili.
I will continue to look into it.	Ndiza kuqhubeka ndijonge kuyo.
However, I can't find a way to do that.	Nangona kunjalo, andikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza oko.
About that.	Malunga naloo nto .
My question is how this happened.	Umbuzo wam kukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
But no, he's too tired.	Kodwa hayi, udiniwe kakhulu.
I can't go there, after that.	Andikwazi ukuhamba apho, emva koko.
All the time, almost everything.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, phantse kuyo yonke into.
He would be the one.	Wayeza kuba nguye lowo.
As soon as possible.	Kwangoko kwangoko.
He would get help.	Wayeza kufumana uncedo.
I know you like it here.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda apha.
Then he got a call.	Emva koko wafumana umnxeba.
I deserve that.	Ndifanele oko.
Everyone is doing your job.	Wonke umntu wenza umsebenzi wakho.
But not with money.	Kodwa hayi ngemali.
Dinner, just the two of us.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa, sobabini kuphela.
Without time, it’s all just me.	Ngaphandle kwexesha, konke kum nje.
He did not know that it could be this way.	Wayengazi ukuba inokuba ngolu hlobo.
When you are human.	Xa ungumntu .
He also had to find a new way.	Kwakhona kwafuneka afune indlela entsha.
But again, it really is not necessary.	Kodwa kwakhona, ngokwenene akufuneki.
Then we will try again for two days.	Emva koko siya kuzama kwakhona iintsuku ezimbini.
I'm going to talk to you tonight.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngokuhlwanje.
I was thinking next week.	Bendicinga kwiveki ezayo.
He knew one thing, though.	Wayesazi into enye, nangona kunjalo.
I do not know what will happen to me.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni kum.
Well, really good.	Kulungile, kuhle ngokwenene.
Either way he has to do something.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela kufuneka enze into.
Your mom just wants a phone call.	Umama wakho ufuna nje umnxeba.
This should not be too difficult to do.	Oku akufanele kube nzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Down all the way.	Phantsi yonke indlela.
You love your wife.	Uyamthanda umfazi wakho.
I want you to stay there.	Ndifuna uhlala apho.
But he will come one day.	Kodwa uya kuza ngenye imini.
No no no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi.
You do whatever you want to do.	Wenza nantoni na ofuna ukuyenza.
We will eat.	Siza kutya.
You want people.	Ufuna abantu.
And also .	Kwaye kwakhona .
However, this is not clearly the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
He will always do so.	Uya kuhlala enjenjalo.
Fast, fast and fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
Again, he tried.	Kwakhona, wazama.
Currently, no.	Okwangoku, akukho.
I want to go outside.	Ndifuna ngaphandle.
I'm sure you know which one.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi ukuba yeyiphi.
He is at last.	Ukhona ekugqibeleni.
Maybe tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi kusasa.
Work above all else.	Umsebenzi ngaphezu kwakho konke.
That is hope for you.	Lithemba elo kuwe.
There is something strange there.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga apho.
He asked many questions.	Wabuza imibuzo emininzi.
So it never happened.	Ngoko akuzange kwenzeke.
Telling someone.	Ukuxelela umntu.
Death or not.	Ukufa okanye akunjalo.
He really wanted to control himself.	Wayefuna ngokwenene ukuzibamba.
Obviously, though, there is something he wants here.	Ngokucacileyo, nangona kunjalo, kukho into ayifunayo apha.
Yes, that will do well.	Ewe, oko kuya kwenza kakuhle.
A lot is always possible.	Okuninzi kuhlala kunokwenzeka.
So you have to go to him.	Ngoko kufuneka uye kuye.
There is nothing more to it.	Akukho nto ingako ngakumbi kuyo.
Meeting at a restaurant.	Intlanganiso kwindawo yokutyela.
And he looks like that too.	Kwaye ukhangeleka ngolo hlobo naye.
This is going to take really, really long.	Oku kuya kuthatha ngokwenene, ixesha elide ngokwenene.
His job is to be something.	Umsebenzi wakhe kukuba into.
Why do you think you want to do that.	Kutheni ucinga ukuba ufuna ukwenza njalo.
Girl, not dad.	Intombi, hayi utata.
No, not a room.	Hayi, hayi igumbi.
No song.	Akukho ngoma.
Maybe I'll do this myself.	Mhlawumbi ndiza kuyenza ngokwam le nto.
He cannot sit or walk.	Akakwazi ukuhlala okanye ukuhamba.
Your father knew better.	Utata wakho wayesazi ngcono.
You play in it.	Udlala kuyo.
I can't say much more about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngakumbi malunga naloo nto.
No, that's fine, really.	Hayi, kulungile, ngokwenene.
Really good message.	Ngokwenene umyalezo olungileyo.
He is.	Nguye .
You know, it's hard to tell.	Uyazi, kuba nzima ukuxelela.
I don't know, I have to.	Andazi, kufuneka.
For really, it is.	Kuba ngokwenene, kunjalo.
And to do the right thing.	Kwaye ukwenza into elungileyo.
He can do this to me.	Angayenza lento kum.
Besides, you probably spend a lot of time at work.	Ngaphezu koko, mhlawumbi uhlala kakhulu emsebenzini.
I only want you.	Ndifuna wena kuphela.
Only a few years.	Kuphela iminyaka embalwa.
No one wanted to talk about him before, of course.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha ngaye ngaphambili, kunjalo.
Play hard to find.	Ukudlala nzima ukufumana.
He wanted more, much more.	Wayefuna okuninzi, okuninzi ngakumbi.
I want it here in the morning.	Ndifuna apha kusasa.
I have known that for years.	Ndiyayazi loo nto iminyaka.
Please, do the right thing.	Nceda, wenze into elungileyo.
But you want to see.	Kodwa ufuna ukubona.
I have to talk to him completely.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngokupheleleyo.
In the meantime, it's your fault.	Okwangoku, ityala lakho.
That has been a great experience for me.	Oko kube yinto enkulu kum.
And all is well for him.	Kwaye konke kulungile kuye.
Marriage at first probably, but in the end, it did not.	Umtshato ekuqaleni mhlawumbi, kodwa ekugqibeleni, awuzange.
I'm not so sure today.	Andiqinisekanga ngolo hlobo namhlanje.
He did not say much at once.	Khange athethe kakhulu ngoko nangoko.
Too many books.	Iincwadi ezininzi kakhulu.
All of this seemed clear and concise.	Konke oku kwakubonakala kucacile kwaye kucacile.
Long, long, long.	Ixesha elide, elide, elide.
How you know this will be very difficult.	Ukwazi njani oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
No vacancy.	Akukho msebenzi.
Not that it will be fun all day.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kuba mnandi imini yonke.
But there is something in it.	Kodwa kukho into kuyo.
You are ready to do so.	Ukulungele ukwenza njalo.
Before making a decision, she wanted to see her son.	Ngaphambi kokuba enze isigqibo, wayefuna ukubona unyana wakhe.
Too bad, this time.	Into embi kakhulu, ngeli xesha.
Then look at me.	Emva koko ujonge kum.
You know more.	Uyazi ngakumbi.
You will keep trying.	Uya kuqhubeka uzama.
He sat on my bed.	Wahlala ebhedini yam.
In the evening my wife died.	Ngokuhlwa umfazi wam wafa.
Before he got into the car.	Phambi kokuba angene emotweni .
And then we come.	Kwaye ke siza.
And you will get help, too.	Kwaye uya kufumana uncedo, naye.
And he did very well.	Kwaye wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
We should, however.	Sifanele, nangona kunjalo.
He will do it perfectly.	Uya kukwenza ngokupheleleyo.
I don't have to talk to you.	Akufunekanga ndithethe nawe.
He entered the city.	Wangena edolophini.
And he was thinking about it a lot.	Kwaye wayecinga ngayo kakhulu.
Everyone has to do something.	Wonke umntu kufuneka enze into.
There is a lot of money there.	Kukho imali eninzi apho.
He did not know what to do next.	Wayengazi ukuba uya kwenza ntoni emva koko.
Finding it really hard.	Ukufumana kunzima ngokwenene.
It all happened thank you.	Konke kwenzeke enkosi kuwe.
You mean everything to me, you know that.	Uthetha yonke into kum, uyayazi loo nto.
No, you have to go fast and alone.	Hayi, kufuneka uhambe ngokukhawuleza kwaye wedwa.
And he is doing very well.	Kwaye uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu.
Thank you so much for this time together.	Enkosi kakhulu ngeli xesha kunye.
Yes Yes .	Ewe Ewe .
But we are not going home.	Kodwa asiyi ekhaya.
At first, nothing happened.	Ekuqaleni, akukho nto eyenzekayo.
All right, now look at what happened to you.	Kulungile, ngoku jonga into eyenzekileyo kuwe.
Or really, don’t.	Okanye ngokwenene, musa.
Every once in a while, this.	Ngalo lonke ixesha kunye nexesha, lo.
Please talk to me now.	Ndicela uthethe nam ngoku.
And to do well.	Kwaye ukwenza kakuhle.
You can just be.	Unokuba nje .
He is going too far.	Uya kude kakhulu.
Then he went out and did not.	Emva koko waphuma akazange.
That would all happen.	Bekuya kwenzeka yonke loo nto.
Otherwise, there is no reason.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho sizathu.
Then he felt it.	Emva koko waziva.
There is talk.	Kukho intetho.
I want to move on.	Ndifuna ukuya phambili.
All because of you, death.	Konke ngenxa yakho, ukufa.
I'm not sure it isn't.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba akunjalo.
And the case after that.	Kwaye ityala emva koko.
Work is scary in another way.	Umsebenzi uyoyika ngenye indlela.
So maybe next week.	Ngoko mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo.
He knew it was me all the time.	Wayesazi ukuba ndim ngalo lonke ixesha.
He knows exactly what is going to happen.	Uyazi kakuhle into eza kwenzeka.
I am well aware of this.	Ndiyazi kakuhle le nto.
He had to stop at last.	Kwafuneka ayeke ekugqibeleni.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi leyo.
Help me again.	Ndincede kwakhona.
Right here .	Apha .
They will say finally.	Baya kuthi ekugqibeleni.
Don't be a friend.	Musa ukuba ngumhlobo.
You love someone else in the end.	Uthanda omnye umntu ekugqibeleni.
But it only takes one.	Kodwa kuthatha nje enye.
Strange thing, that.	Into engaqhelekanga, leyo.
It's okay with me.	Ilungile ngam.
With our one money as much as possible.	Ngemali yethu enye kangangoko.
Not too bad.	Hayi kakubi kakhulu.
And then, my.	Kwaye emva koko, bam.
Maybe you want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
A little bit of everything.	Kancinci kuyo yonke into.
Not all the way up here.	Hayi yonke indlela apha phezulu.
We will go faster, and we will go.	Siza kuhamba ngokukhawuleza, kwaye siya kuhamba.
Then he seemed to make a decision.	Emva koko wabonakala esenza isigqibo.
At first, it is very difficult to play.	Ekuqaleni, kunzima kakhulu ukudlala.
Music, and everything else.	Umculo, nayo yonke enye into.
He got one, a little bit.	Wafumana enye, kancinci.
It could be high.	Inokuba phezulu.
He had to think about that.	Kwafuneka acinge ngaloo nto.
The son obviously does not like it.	Unyana ngokucacileyo akayithandi.
He was going to stay, he finally decided.	Wayeza kuhlala, wagqiba ekugqibeleni.
He took his things.	Wathatha izinto zakhe.
All that in the background.	Konke oko ngasemva.
you know why you are good.	uyazi ukuba kutheni ulungile.
And then it's time.	Kwaye ke lixesha.
Since he got the call.	Oko wafumana umnxeba.
He did not want a new one.	Wayengafuni entsha.
The worst, the worst.	Into embi, embi kakhulu.
Make good money.	Yenziwe imali entle.
Yes, man will do it.	Ewe, umntu uya kuyenza.
I'm not sure how old it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kudala kangakanani.
Then, we have to go.	Emva koko, kufuneka sihambe.
Good job on this.	Umsebenzi omhle kule nto.
I'm not sure what it is, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni, kodwa .
Today, it happened again.	Namhlanje, yenzeke kwakhona.
It would be nice to go for a long walk.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuhamba ixesha elide.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Akafuni kwenza nto.
What is wrong with that ?.	Yintoni engalunganga apho?.
And no one is saying that.	Kwaye akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
Man, this one is going to take a lot of time.	Mntu, lo uza kuthatha ixesha elininzi.
He wanted to do too much.	Wayefuna ukwenza okuninzi kakhulu.
I wanted to know how everything would go.	Ndandifuna ukwazi ukuba yonke into iza kuhamba njani.
My mother never said anything about it.	Umama akazange athethe nto ngayo.
She realized then that she had to tell him everything.	Waqonda ngoko ukuba kufuneka amxelele yonke into.
Doing the best you can.	Ukwenza konke okusemandleni.
But no, obviously not.	Kodwa hayi, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He was not difficult.	Wayengekho nzima.
My mother couldn't do it.	Umama akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
We definitely have to have it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka sibe nayo.
It was not at all.	Kwakungekho kwaphela.
But yes, you have to go there.	Kodwa ewe, kufuneka uye apho.
I know we have to go.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka sihambe.
But you know that it is not.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba akunjalo.
The image has done it again.	Umfanekiso uyenzile kwakhona.
A few .	Ezimbalwa .
But maybe not this one.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi le.
Time after time after time.	Ixesha emva kwexesha emva kwexesha.
In the end, it's probably better that way.	Ekugqibeleni, mhlawumbi kungcono ngolo hlobo.
He walked fast, fast.	Wahamba ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza.
If you know that.	Ukuba uyakwazi oko .
Because you really do not know what is going to happen.	Kuba ngenene awuyazi into eza kwenzeka.
You will find out all about it.	Uya kufumana konke malunga naloo nto.
And money.	Kwaye imali.
It’s something to do with money.	Yinto yokwenza ngemali.
However, your approach is good.	Nangona kunjalo, indlela yakho ilungile.
Football will come to us.	Ibhola iza kuthi.
Without one you cannot get one.	Ngaphandle komnye awukwazi ukufumana enye.
And you can do it today.	Kwaye ungayenza namhlanje.
And then your life.	Kwaye ke ubomi bakho.
Only that did not happen.	Kuphela loo nto ayizange yenzeke.
I don't say you have to do anything.	Andithi kufuneka wenze nantoni na.
I never thought it would happen again.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba iya kwenzeka kwakhona.
I try as much as I can.	Ndizama kangangoko ukuba.
He needs to come soon.	Kufuneka eze ngokukhawuleza.
All right, we'll move on again.	Kulungile, siza kuqhubeka kwakhona.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu ngayo yonke into.
It cannot be otherwise.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba kube ngenye indlela.
He stepped next to her.	Wangena ecaleni kwakhe.
This did not happen overnight.	Oku akuzange kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He wants to go every day.	Ufuna ukuhamba yonke imihla.
One day, not two.	Ngenye imini, hayi ezimbini.
Go ahead.	Iya phambili.
By this you mean me.	Ngalo ke uthetha mna.
Good way.	Indlela entle.
He told me he had to leave.	Wandixelela ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
And he knew exactly why.	Kwaye wayesazi kakuhle ukuba kwakutheni.
I told her everything about you.	Ndimxelele yonke into ngawe.
That was clear enough.	Oko kwakucacile ngokwaneleyo.
But he says he wants a few days.	Kodwa uthi ufuna iintsuku ezimbalwa.
I want us to do the right thing.	Ndifuna ukuba senze into elungileyo.
And because he loves her.	Kwaye ngenxa yokuba uyamthanda.
It seemed to be going well.	Kwakubonakala kuhamba ngcono.
That's the mind.	Nantso ingqondo.
He doesn't like it, though.	Akayithandi, nangona kunjalo.
He has to do that.	Kufuneka ayenze loo nto.
One can do this.	Umntu uyakwazi ukwenza oku.
He asked me for advice.	Wandicela icebiso.
Before you anyone.	Ngaphambi kwakho nabani na.
I know this for myself.	Ndiyakwazi oku ngokwam.
That's why he came back to her.	Yiyo loo nto wabuyela kuye.
He told her that.	Wamxelela ukuba.
Well, maybe not so much, but some.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu, kodwa ezinye.
I didn't want to do that either.	Nam ndandingafuni kuyenza lonto.
He did not know that it was so.	Wayengazi ukuba kunjalo.
And that will be soon.	Kwaye oko kuya kuba kungekudala.
But he did it very quickly.	Kodwa wayenza ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I have to tell you that.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele ukuba.
Another problem.	Enye ingxaki .
We'll get something.	Siza kufumana into.
Nothing will happen today.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka namhlanje.
We'll see more.	Siza kubona ngakumbi.
Your mother may have done that.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba umama wakho wakwenza oko.
No one ever knew.	Akukho mntu wakha wazi.
You do not know what it is right now.	Awuyazi ukuba yintoni okwangoku.
He does not want to stay here.	Akafuni kuhlala apha.
He did not think.	Wayengacingi.
I want to go find my dad.	Ndifuna ukuya kufuna utata wam.
Yes, she is beautiful.	Ewe, mhle.
That will mean life in prison for the rest of your life.	Oko kuya kuthetha entolongweni ubomi bakho bonke.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nceda undixelele ukuba yintoni.
He found a wife.	Wafumana umfazi.
He never was a kid, you know.	Akazange abe ngumntwana, uyazi.
Now, he wanted her to stay.	Ngoku, wayefuna ukuba ahlale.
All the time, probably.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, mhlawumbi.
He has spoken to us.	Uye wathetha nathi.
That's why	Ke ngoko
And, he did.	Kwaye, wenza.
Well, we'll see what happens.	Kulungile, siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I wanted you to know about it, though.	Bendifuna wazi ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
So I need your help.	Ngoko ndifuna uncedo lwakho.
He didn't know what he wanted anymore.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ntoni kwakhona.
I just have to think.	Kufuneka ndicinge nje.
I can read later.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda kamva.
And you did well for me.	Kwaye wenze kakuhle ngam.
Then no one will see.	Emva koko akukho mntu uya kubona.
He left immediately.	Uye wahamba ngoko nangoko.
So please tell me.	Ngoko ndicela undixelele.
I told her just that.	Ndamxelela kunjalo nje.
But first tell me your name.	Kodwa kuqala undixelele igama lakho.
I did it the other way.	Ndenze ngenye indlela.
Then he left.	Emva koko wemka naye.
I certainly did not know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingazi.
He felt very strange.	Waziva engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I couldn’t get a job, though.	Andikwazanga ukufumana umsebenzi, nangona kunjalo.
And now I'm tired.	Kwaye ngoku ndidiniwe.
He is just like everyone else.	Unjalo nje naye wonke umntu.
It is very difficult to tell.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukuxelela.
Yes, he says yes.	Ewe, uthi ewe.
How can you do this ?.	Ungayenza njani lento?.
He would talk to her.	Wayeza kuthetha naye.
It wasn't all about him.	Kwakungekho ngaye konke.
His eyes are on me.	Amehlo akhe ahlala kum.
I'm really glad I got more time at home.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene kuba nexesha elingakumbi ekhaya.
And of course, it is not.	Kwaye kunjalo, akunjalo.
Not that he wasn't pretty.	Hayi ukuba wayengekho mhle.
He gave me a good message.	Wandinika umyalezo olungileyo.
Anyone.	Nokuba ngubani .
He did not say another word.	Akazange athethe elinye igama.
But you have a big problem.	Kodwa unengxaki enkulu.
You will definitely find someone there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufumana umntu apho.
If he doesn't come back.	Ukuba akasayi kubuya.
It's hard enough for me.	Kunzima ngokwaneleyo ukuba ndim.
I've thought a lot too.	Nam ndiye ndacinga kakhulu.
Well, and probably not for long right now.	Hayi ke, kwaye mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide okwangoku.
I wanted to talk to you about it.	Bendifuna ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
And how good.	Kwaye kulungile njani.
It was not late now.	Kwakungekho mva ngoku.
Tell me where you live.	Ndixelele apho uhlala khona.
So you have to sit down.	Ngoko kufuneka uhlale phantsi.
Well, he said at last.	Kulungile, wathi ekugqibeleni.
But this is enough.	Kodwa oku ngokwaneleyo.
They all said they did not.	Bonke bathi abazange.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Mhlawumbi yiloo ndlela.
Nothing happened to him.	Akukho kwanto eyenzekileyo kuye.
I did it my way.	Ndenze ngendlela yam.
But we need to be better at it.	Kodwa kufuneka sibe ngcono kuyo.
It's very difficult again.	Kunzima kakhulu kwakhona.
I have been thinking about you a lot lately.	Bendicinga ngawe kakhulu mva nje.
He sat in his bedroom.	Wahlala kwigumbi lakhe lokulala.
I will not, of course.	Andiyi, kunjalo.
Then it was not so easy.	Emva koko akuzange kube lula kangako.
Then comes the wedding.	Emva koko kuza umtshato.
My father made mistakes.	Utata wenza iimpazamo.
Everyone wants to know that.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukwazi oko.
He has said there is no way.	Uye wathi akukho ndlela.
He is trying very hard.	Uzama kakhulu.
I thought straight.	Ndicinge kakuhle.
It happens more often than you think.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kunokuba ucinga.
One day, another day.	Ngenye imini, ngenye imini .
Please do this together.	Nceda wenze le ubuthe uya kuyenza.
You look at your daughter.	Ujonge intombi yakho.
That seemed old-fashioned.	Oko kwakubonakala kudala.
I'm sorry now.	Ndiyaxolisa ngoku.
I know for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo.
I just want to try.	Ndifuna nje ukuzama.
It means to give up.	Kuthetha ukuyeka.
My wife, however, is not.	Umfazi wam, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo.
However, he thought.	Nangona kunjalo, wacinga.
But this will not happen immediately.	Kodwa oku akuyi kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Or too long.	Okanye ixesha elide kakhulu.
So it will be.	Ngoko kuya kuba njalo.
One has to know, not to decide.	Umntu kufuneka azi, hayi ukugqiba.
My mother did not do that.	Umama akazange enze njalo.
I couldn’t say it all, though.	Andikwazanga ukuyithetha yonke, nangona kunjalo.
Thanks for this !.	Enkosi ngale nto!.
You will get everything.	Uya kufumana yonke into.
He does it for many days, but not today.	Uyenza iintsuku ezininzi, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
I really have to do that regularly.	Ngokwenene kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto rhoqo.
I wanted him to say something about it.	Bendifuna athethe into ngayo.
Or because.	Okanye ngenxa yokuba.
But you can get better.	Kodwa unokuba ngcono.
It's hard for me to talk about it.	Kunzima kum ukuthetha ngayo.
You will try.	Uya kuzama.
This goes on for days.	Oku kuqhubeka iintsuku.
Just as you will make mistakes.	Kanye njengokuba uya kwenza iimpazamo.
He looked hard.	Wajonga ngamandla.
I would like your help.	Ndingathanda uncedo lwakho.
You know you have time.	Uyazi ukuba unexesha.
But because he is a good man.	Kodwa ngenxa yokuba ungumntu olungileyo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba ucinge ngenye into.
But he was not sure what he was going to say.	Kodwa wayengazi kakuhle ukuba uza kuthetha ntoni na.
I have waited all my life to know.	Ndilinde ubomi bam bonke ukuba ndiyazi.
But tell me one thing.	Kodwa ndixelele into enye.
I can't work right now.	Andikwazi ukusebenza ngoku.
Or a few weeks.	Okanye iiveki ezimbalwa.
Someone looked out.	Umntu wajonga phandle.
I need a father.	Ndifuna utata.
He never told me the whole story.	Zange andixelele lonke ibali.
I'm just here because everyone is there.	Ndilapha nje kuba wonke umntu ukhona.
That will be.	Oko uya kuba.
At home, of course.	Ekhaya, kunjalo.
And thank you for dinner.	Kwaye enkosi ngesidlo sangokuhlwa.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka njalo.
All is well for him.	Konke kulungile kuye.
It has almost.	Kuye phantse.
And maybe this.	Kwaye mhlawumbi oku.
I want to be alone with you.	Ndifuna ukuba ndedwa nawe.
But someone tried.	Kodwa umntu wazama.
Or he became me.	Okanye waba ndim.
No, everything is fine.	Hayi, yonke into ilungile.
He gave me a chance.	Wandinika ithuba.
It will stay there all night.	Iza kuhlala apho ubusuku bonke.
One should not do this lightly.	Umntu akufunekanga ayenze kancinci le nto.
You know, you think.	Uyazi, ucinga.
It seemed like nothing.	Kwakubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
Or maybe soon.	Okanye mhlawumbi kungekudala.
But we have not been together for a long time.	Kodwa asizange sibe kunye ixesha elide.
Do not do strange things.	Musa ukwenza into engaqhelekanga.
I'm not sure about this yet.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto okwangoku.
I am very happy to see this.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukubona oku.
Sure enough, you heard about him.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, weva ngaye.
Then, maybe, something else.	Emva koko, mhlawumbi, enye into.
It looks like it will continue.	Kubonakala ngathi iza kuqhubeka.
But you certainly know everything about it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi konke malunga nayo.
I just want to stay with you.	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala nawe.
He knows where he lives.	Uyazi ke apho ahlala khona.
I do not want to give up.	Andikuthandi ukuyeka.
No question, it has come to me.	Akukho mbuzo, uye weza kum.
Then tell me about him.	Ndixelele ke ngaye.
Yes, at dinner.	Ewe, kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
Not that it will ever get better.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kuba ngcono.
It will be better to know.	Kuya kuba ngcono ukwazi.
Eating alone.	Ukutya yedwa.
It was not for him to do so.	Kwakungekho kuye ukwenjenjalo.
It's all there.	Kukho konke apho.
Down in front of him.	Phantsi phambi kwakhe.
Well, we'll try that first.	Kulungile, siza kuzama oko kuqala.
You need to know better.	Kufuneka wazi ngcono.
Far, far away from it.	Kude, kude kuyo.
He told me he would be here.	Undixelele ukuba uzakuba lapha.
But you should not be.	Kodwa akufanele ube.
And it really isn't.	Kwaye ngokwenene akunjalo.
He has to make his way first.	Kufuneka enze indlela yakhe kuqala.
No one has done a great thing with it.	Akukho mntu wenze into enkulu ngayo.
You and your friends.	Wena kunye nabahlobo bakho.
You do not have to speak.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthethe.
It's too much.	Yinto kakhulu.
In any case.	Kuyo nayiphi na le nto.
Because everyone is good.	Kuba wonke umntu olungileyo.
That means someone else is making a way out.	Oko kuthetha ukuba omnye umntu wenza indlela.
And I love it.	Kwaye ndiyayithanda.
How ?.	Njani na?.
Well, it's just a small thing.	Kulungile, yinto nje encinci.
Although in the end he did.	Nangona ekugqibeleni wayenza.
Only a little bit.	Kuphela kancinci kancinci.
They say there is no way.	Bathi akukho ndlela.
It also seems to us.	Kwakhona kubonakala ngathi .
I will do it.	Ndiza kwenza.
He has never been in a place like this before.	Akazange abe kwindawo enje ngaphambili.
Don't you think ?.	Awucingi?.
Seeing that food.	Ukubona ukutya oko.
It is impossible for us to do the same.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba nathi senze oko.
I am going to the house.	Ndiya endlini.
Nothing could be better.	Akukho nto inokuba ngcono.
Just like a real person.	Kanye njengokuba umntu ngokwenene.
Well, really.	Kuhle, ngenene.
It will be our reality.	Iya kuba yinyani yethu.
It seems later than it actually is.	Kubonakala emva kwexesha kunokuba kunjalo.
I'm not sure why, though.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni, nangona kunjalo.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, unjalo ngokwenene.
For your life.	Kuba ubomi bakho.
That way, her daughter will earn more money.	Ngaloo ndlela, intombi yakhe iya kufumana imali eninzi.
This is difficult, but possible.	Oku kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
This, of course, is you.	Oku, kunjalo, nguwe.
Please do that as soon as possible.	Nceda wenze oko ngokukhawuleza.
I'd like .	Ndingathanda .
I do not have a phone.	Andinayo ifowuni.
He gave me his number.	Uye wandinika inombolo yakhe.
You have already done so.	Ubuthe sele wenze njalo.
I want to have children with her.	Ndifuna ukuba nabantwana nayo.
Also, she is a little dressy.	Kwakhona, unxibe kancinci.
That is why it is so difficult.	Yiyo loo nto kunzima kangaka.
Meals happen at night.	Ukutya kwenzeka ebusuku.
A good place for you, too.	Indawo entle kuwe, nawe.
The big thing about it.	Into enkulu ngayo.
He obviously knew a lot.	Ngokucacileyo wayesazi kakhulu.
Not my son, but my daughter.	Hayi unyana wam, kodwa intombi yam.
Then everyone is better at it.	Emva koko wonke umntu ungcono kuyo.
I do not know outside.	Andazi ngaphandle.
Many years.	Iminyaka emininzi.
He speaks out.	Uthetha phandle.
There is something wrong inside.	Kukho into engalunganga ngaphakathi.
My wife, too.	Umfazi wam, nawe.
He does this for everyone, you know.	Wenza oku kuye wonke umntu, uyazi.
I wish I could do the same.	Ndinqwenela ukwenza into efanayo.
It's just hard to do.	Kunzima nje ukwenza.
Or not, in this case.	Okanye akunjalo, kule meko.
But no, that would be too easy.	Kodwa hayi, oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
And then nothing.	Kwaye ke akukho nto.
We will try to meet him.	Siza kuzama ukudibana naye.
In an unusual place.	Kwindawo engaqhelekanga.
Many hours, a lot of coffee.	Iiyure ezininzi, ikofu eninzi.
No one has ever done such a thing.	Akukho mntu wakha wenza into enje.
Probably once.	Mhlawumbi kanye.
They will do their best to find the answer.	Baya kwenza konke okusemandleni ukufumana impendulo.
Then he saw something.	Emva koko wabona into.
Of course they did not.	Ngenene abazange.
And maybe for us, it will be so.	Kwaye mhlawumbi kuthi, kuya kuba njalo.
He can never know for sure.	Akanakuze azi ngokuqinisekileyo.
My mother just sits all day.	Umama uhleli nje imini yonke.
Yes, that's right! 	Ewe, kulungile!
He asked me where it was.	Wandibuza ukuba iphi.
I will only talk to you.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kuphela.
You will never talk about anything.	Soze uthethe ngayo nantoni na.
My wife is tired.	Umfazi wam udiniwe.
Here I am with you.	Ndim nawe lo.
No one has everything.	Akukho mntu unayo yonke into.
Week, week out.	Iveki, iveki ngaphandle.
That is the problem, though.	Ingxaki ke leyo, nangona kunjalo.
But we did a little bit at everything.	Kodwa senze kancinci kuyo yonke into.
He died before him.	Wafa phambi kwakhe.
Obviously, you look good.	Ngokucacileyo, ubonakala ulungile.
Yes, it can be that simple.	Ewe, kunokuba lula ngolo hlobo.
Learning to play the piano.	Ukufunda ukudlala ipiyano.
You don't know what it is.	Awuyazi ukuba yintoni .
Let me tell you why.	Makhe ndikuxelele ukuba kutheni.
But perhaps he did not have to.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
We want to think about it for sure.	Sifuna ukucinga ngayo ngokuqinisekileyo.
Before he could speak.	Phambi kokuba athethe.
Yes it is good.	Ewe kuhle.
And it wasn't hard.	Kwaye kwakungekho nzima.
I did just that.	Ndenze kanye le nto.
I can go to my room.	Ndiyakwazi ukuya egumbini lam.
Yes Yes.	Ewe ewe.
No, you think, never meat.	Hayi, ucinga, soze inyama.
You didn't have much to say.	Awuzange ube kakhulu ukuthetha.
My name .	Igama lam .
Not today, and certainly not tomorrow.	Hayi namhlanje, kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngomso.
I'm late again.	Ndifike emva kwexesha kwakhona.
Maybe you're scared.	Mhlawumbi uyoyika.
There is no work in it.	Akukho msebenzi kuyo.
And you did everything better this time.	Kwaye wenze konke ngcono ngeli xesha.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga wena ngalo lonke ixesha.
I do not know why this might be so.	Andazi ukuba kutheni le nto inokuba njalo.
It wasn’t easy, though.	Kwakungekho lula, nangona kunjalo.
Then he left.	Emva koko, wemka.
He would tell her as much as he could.	Wayeza kumxelela kangangoko.
So it's hard to control yourself.	Ngoko ke kunzima ukuzibamba.
In his house.	Endlwini yakhe.
Then we'll see what it is.	Emva koko siza kubona ukuba yintoni na.
I hope to see more of him soon.	Ndiyathemba ukubona ngakumbi kuye kungekudala.
But, you know, it isn't.	Kodwa, uyazi, akunjalo.
That is hope.	Lithemba elo.
As we know now, it is not.	Njengoko siyazi ngoku, akunjalo.
He had never thought of that far before.	Akazange acinge kude kangako ngaphambili.
Everyone wanted to come.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuza.
It's right in place.	Ilungile kwindawo.
He should have known better now.	Bekufanele ukuba wayesazi ngcono ngoku.
But will they do anything about it?	Kodwa ngaba baya kwenza nantoni na ngaloo nto?
He said last night.	Uthe ebusuku.
It'll be just the same thing.	Iya kuba yinto enye kanye.
That, and only.	Oko, kwaye kuphela.
Yeah, not really.	Ewe, hayi kakuhle.
Because now.	Ngenxa yokuba ngoku.
The first person he spoke to.	Umntu wokuqala wathetha naye.
Please or.	Nceda okanye.
That's what we all need to do.	Nantso into ekufuneka siyenze sonke.
We all want peace.	Sonke sifuna uxolo.
However, it was not done.	Nangona kunjalo, ayizange yenziwe.
Obviously, yes.	Ngokucacileyo, ewe.
I'm not even sure about that either.	Nam andiqinisekanga ngale ndlela.
I love it, though, you love it.	Ndiyayithanda, nangona kunjalo, uyayithanda.
There is less money.	Kukho imali encinci.
He does not need to know.	Akufuneki ukuba azi.
All is well!.	Konke kulungile!.
Maybe that's okay for now.	Mhlawumbi oko kulungile okwangoku.
Then he went to his own house.	Emva koko waya endlwini yakhe.
He always has it with you.	Uhlala unayo nawe.
One day he was gone.	Ngenye imini wayengekho.
Thank you so much for being with me.	Enkosi kakhulu ngokuba nam.
So he is the only one.	Ngoko nguye kuphela.
I am convinced that there is no danger.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho ngozi.
All right, just look at that.	Kulungile, jonga nje loo nto.
Yes, come on ?.	Ewe, uza?.
That's a bad thing.	Nantso ke into embi.
Again, it happens.	Kwakhona, kwenzeka.
I will not return.	Andisayi kubuya.
And something happened to it.	Kwaye kukho into eyenzekayo kuyo.
He did not speak.	Zange athethe.
And no, that's not possible.	Kwaye hayi, akunakwenzeka.
Something very unusual was happening.	Kukho into engaqhelekanga ngokwenene eyenzekayo.
A little something, he thought.	Into encinci, wacinga.
All the time people.	Ngalo lonke ixesha abantu.
And yes, there is a chance.	Kwaye ewe, kukho ithuba.
I don't think you want that to happen.	Andiqondi ukuba ufuna ukuba kwenzeke oko.
He wanted money from her.	Wayefuna imali kuye.
Maybe you can have it.	Mhlawumbi unokuba nayo.
The truth is that we are nothing.	Inyaniso kukuba asiyonto.
So I know there is a better way.	Ke ndiyazi ukuba kukho indlela engcono.
I wonder, too.	Ndiyazibuza, nam.
If something happens to me.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kum .
Now it seems that it is time.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi lixesha.
I definitely learned something new today.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifunde into entsha namhlanje.
He didn't know you could do that.	Wayengazi ukuba ungayenza loo nto.
We want to be together.	Sifuna ukuba kunye.
He wants to play on the floor.	Ufuna ukudlala phantsi.
I sit down and wait.	Ndihlale phantsi ndilinde.
It was better yesterday afternoon.	Kungcono izolo emva kwemini.
You did the right thing to get out of there.	Wenze into elungileyo ukuphuma apho.
But you have to come now.	Kodwa kufuneka uze ngoku.
No it isn't, it's better.	Hayi akunjalo, kungcono.
I'm just not really into it.	Andikho nje kuyo ngokwenene.
I've already gone too far.	Sele ndihambe kakhulu.
He is the only one now.	Nguye kuphela ngoku.
Well almost anything.	Kulungile phantse nantoni na.
But maybe it's you and me tonight.	Kodwa mhlawumbi nguwe kunye nam ngokuhlwanje.
Maybe he should stay in school longer.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka ahlale esikolweni ixesha elide.
I feel like it is not.	Ndiziva ngathi akunjalo.
He said he needed to talk to her right away.	Wathi kufuneka athethe naye ngoko nangoko.
Not as you think.	Hayi njengokuba ucinga.
And this, in the end, is enough.	Kwaye oku, ekugqibeleni, ngokwaneleyo.
Only if you want to.	Kuphela ukuba uyafuna.
He did it all night.	Wayenza yonke loo nto ubusuku bonke.
I don’t know where to look, though.	Andazi ukuba ndijonge phi, nangona kunjalo.
Don't go anywhere.	Musa ukuya kwindawo.
He is human again.	Ungumntu kwakhona.
Beautiful woman, beautiful girl, everything beautiful.	Umfazi omhle, intombi entle, yonke into entle.
This will make your stay more enjoyable.	Oku kuya kwenza ukuhlala kwakho kube mnandi ngakumbi.
Only that is not the case at all.	Kuphela akunjalo kwaphela.
I don’t want to do that though.	Andifuni ukuyenza loo nto nangona kunjalo.
I really want to talk to you.	Ndifuna kakhulu ukuthetha nawe.
But he is not here.	Kodwa akakho apha.
So, bad.	Ngoko, kakubi.
He confessed himself.	Wavuma ngokwakhe.
Nothing really, of course.	Akukho nto ngokwenene, kunjalo.
This was not for me.	Oku kwakungekho kum.
I think he's fine, though.	Ndicinga ukuba ulungile, nangona kunjalo.
I want to say that.	Ndifuna ukuyithetha loo nto.
We'll start there.	Siza kuqala apho.
Better, but not too much.	Ngcono, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
You did not speak to him.	Khange uthethe naye.
He thought something bad was happening here.	Wayecinga ukuba kukho into embi eyenzekayo apha.
You will definitely find out.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufumana.
Quickly at this time.	Ngokukhawuleza ngeli xesha.
Good enough, too.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, kwakhona.
Do not go easy on it.	Musa ukuhamba lula kuyo.
No one really knows what is going on.	Akukho mntu wazi kakuhle ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I would like to do something.	Ndingathanda ukuba ndenze into.
This will not anger you.	Oku akuyi kuba nomsindo.
Looks like we're going to sit down together soon.	Kubonakala ngathi siza kuhlala phantsi kunye kungekudala.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje .
He will never stop thinking about me.	Soze ayeke ukucinga ngam.
Very large area.	Indawo enkulu kakhulu.
You better go now.	Kungcono uhambe ngoku .
I also apologize.	Nam ndicela uxolo.
And it is coming sooner than you think.	Kwaye iza ngokukhawuleza kunokuba ucinga.
So it is not possible.	Ngoko akunakwenzeka.
He pulled out a little.	Wakhupha kancinci.
He can do everything.	Uyakwazi ukwenza yonke into.
When he did not.	Xa engazange.
Moreover, he could not speak.	Ngaphezu koko akazange akwazi ukuthetha.
He doesn't have to know.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba azi.
It will last up to a week.	Iza kuhlala ukuya kwiveki.
He did not even know what the problem was.	Wayengazi nokuba yintoni ingxaki.
I would like coffee.	Bendifuna ikofu.
My father went to work.	Utata waya emsebenzini.
of course.	kunjalo.
I think anyone can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba nabani na angayenza.
No one wants his time or money.	Akukho mntu ufuna ixesha lakhe okanye imali yakhe.
He spoke to me after lunch.	Uye wathetha nam emva kwesidlo sasemini.
You have to do this.	Kufuneka uyenze le nto.
One will do.	Omnye uya kwenza.
This is something you should always do.	Le yinto ekufuneka usoloko uyenza.
Just look at the children.	Jonga nje abantwana.
I think we need to do something.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka senze into.
But no one wants to dwell on this.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala kule nto.
And he couldn't help himself.	Kwaye akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
What the hell .	Yintoni .
This is possible, this is possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka, oku kunokwenzeka.
But he is not there yet.	Kodwa akakho okwangoku.
Only for us.	Kuphela ngathi.
Did you know .	Ubusazi .
Right there.	Kanye apho.
He stopped talking.	Kwaphela ukuthetha.
We were never together.	Zange sibe kunye.
But there is something in that place.	Kodwa kukho into kuloo ndawo.
So, finally, he settled down.	Ngoko, ekugqibeleni, wahlala.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ingxaki apha.
He came looking for a job.	Weza efuna umsebenzi.
I thought you were fine this time.	Bendicinga ukuba uhambe kakuhle ngeli xesha.
Anyone in the car for that.	Nabani na emotweni ngaloo nto.
It just so happened that he was looking for me.	Kuye kwenzeka ukuba afune mna.
It all happened without me.	Konke kwenzeka ngaphandle kwam.
That is not the only new thing.	Ayisiyiyo kuphela into entsha leyo.
I am just from now on.	Ndim nje ukusukela ngoku ukuya phambili.
He should not know about it at all.	Akufunekanga azi ngalonto kwaphela.
Now he says.	Ngoku uthi.
No, it's you.	Hayi, nguwe.
This would require money.	Oku bekuya kufuna imali.
Not just death, no.	Hayi nje ukufa, hayi.
I absolutely did not want to.	Ndandingafuni ngokupheleleyo.
Hard to say, I don't know.	Kunzima ukuthetha, andazi.
Now, you can control yourself.	Ngoku, uyakwazi ukuzibamba.
It seemed clear, at first.	Kwakubonakala kucacile, ngaphambili.
Obviously there are a few exceptions.	Ngokucacileyo kukho ezimbalwa ngaphandle.
Everyone loves my dog.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda inja yam.
I only know that it will be so.	Ndiyazi kuphela ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
It could be either.	Inokuba yiyo okanye.
Check the location to find out for sure.	Jonga indawo ukuze wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You can do that !!!.	Ungayenza lonto!!!.
At all times.	Ngalo lonke ixesha rhoqo.
I'm not late.	Andikho late.
Then he went inside.	Emva koko wangena ngaphakathi.
Or if you just want to talk.	Okanye ukuba ufuna nje ukuthetha.
Or they will stay at home.	Okanye baya kuhlala ekhaya.
Whatever happens to you.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
We will have plenty of time.	Siza kuba nexesha elininzi.
I don't know what to do with it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngayo.
We will have it down here soon.	Siza kuba nayo apha phantsi ngaphambi kwexesha elide.
But he does it very well.	Kodwa uyenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Call to make.	Umnxeba wokwenza.
So, he did just that.	Ngoko, wenza kanye loo nto.
But now is a good time.	Kodwa ngoku lixesha elihle.
Other than that, it's much better.	Ngaphandle koko, kungcono kakhulu.
But that takes too much time.	Kodwa kuthatha ixesha elininzi kakhulu oko.
Then he fell asleep again.	Emva koko walala kwakhona.
I had to do it a certain way.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze ngendlela ethile.
I can't talk about this.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngale nto.
I just wanted his time.	Bendifuna nje ixesha lakhe.
I'm talking about something very, very important.	Ndithetha ngento ethile kakhulu.
I really thought this was true.	Ngenene bendicinga ukuba le yinyani.
Or he may have thought that he wanted children.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba ufuna abantwana.
I can't talk about you.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngawe.
Except he wasn't very visible about everything.	Ngaphandle kokuba wayengabonakali kakhulu malunga nayo yonke into.
He knows he needs help.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka ancede.
And now, you probably know why.	Kwaye ngoku, mhlawumbi uyazi ukuba kutheni.
I can simplify that.	Ndiyakwazi ukuyenza lula loo nto.
You will not go far.	Awuyi kufika kude.
Tell her parents.	Xelela abazali bakhe.
It should be really easy to try.	Kufuneka kube lula ngokwenene ukuzama.
I tried a new method.	Ndazama indlela entsha.
I never thought to try.	Khange ndicinge ukuzama.
He wanted her to know about it.	Wayefuna ukuba azi ngayo.
You want to buy more.	Ufuna ukuthenga ngakumbi.
Way too much, obviously.	Indlela kakhulu, ngokucacileyo.
No problem for me.	Akukho ngxaki kum.
Behind him it becomes a little harder.	Emva kwakhe kuba nzima kancinci.
If not .	Ukuba akukho njalo .
And very well.	Kwaye kakuhle kakhulu.
You know you will do anything.	Uyazi ukuba uya kwenza nantoni na.
This would be an unusual thing to do.	Oku kuya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga ukuyenza.
I feel better about myself.	Ndiziva ngcono ngam.
So he was left.	Ngoko wayesele .
He ran forward.	Wabaleka waya phambili.
I will not be anything.	Andiyi kuba yinto.
He talks about it quickly.	Uthetha ngaloo nto ngokukhawuleza.
I want under me.	Ndifuna phantsi kwam.
Don't you know that.	Ngaba awuyazi loo nto.
I don't want any problems at home.	Andifuni ngxaki ekhaya.
Or me, with that.	Okanye mna, ngaloo nto.
This is possible but not possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He sat down with us.	Wahlala nathi phantsi.
No one thought too much of it.	Akukho mntu wayecinga kakhulu ngayo.
There is certainly no one today.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu namhlanje.
Everywhere and no place.	Kuyo yonke indawo kwaye akukho ndawo.
Probably very good, though.	Mhlawumbi kakuhle kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
There is something wrong with that.	Kukho into engalunganga kuloo nto.
I know you may have felt that way.	Ndiyazi ukuba unokuba waziva ngolo hlobo.
I don't want to be this way.	Andifuni ukuba ngolu hlobo.
I do not want a specific number.	Andifuni inombolo ethile.
But you have to do this.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze oku.
She is not with the children.	Akakho nabantwana.
She does her homework.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe wasekhaya.
It was not easy to do.	Kwakungekho lula ukwenza.
We need to do something about it.	Kufuneka senze into ngayo.
You want to quit.	Ufuna ukuyeka.
He has given me a way.	Uye wandinika indlela.
This is something like this.	Le yinto enje.
However, we will not talk about him.	Nangona kunjalo, asiyi kuthetha ngaye.
He was very thoughtful.	Wayecinga kakhulu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi kusenokwenzeka ukuba akakwazi.
Very fast for every response.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu kuyo yonke impendulo.
That will do something.	Oko kuya kwenza into.
Why did he come.	Kwakutheni ukuze eze.
But not low enough.	Kodwa hayi phantsi ngokwaneleyo.
I had to go to work myself.	Kwafuneka ndiye emsebenzini mna.
You must have heard about it.	Umele ukuba weva ngayo.
Nice coat.	Idyasi entle.
And everything is up.	Kunye yonke into phezulu.
He had a hard time with her.	Waba nzima naye.
Look at everything in the room !.	Jonga yonke into egumbini!.
Or, maybe, three.	Okanye, mhlawumbi, ezintathu.
He said no.	Uye wathi hayi.
See what time it is.	Jonga ukuba ngubani ixesha.
Not for a long time, though.	Hayi ixesha elide, kodwa .
And all stopping to be too hard for you.	Kunye kwaye konke ukuyeka ukuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
You really have to do that.	Kufuneka wenze oko ngokwenene.
He did not know what happened next.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
You know that, or you don't know it, you should.	Uyayazi loo nto, okanye ukuba awuyazi, kufuneka.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kubonakala ukuba akunjalo.
But it does not seem that easy.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akukho lula kangako.
Now he is gone.	Ngoku wemka.
He wanted more for all of us.	Wayefuna okuninzi kuthi sonke.
After a while he came back to me.	Emva kwexesha uye wabuyela kum.
No, it's really good.	Hayi, ilungile ngokwenene.
If we go nowhere.	Ukuba asiyi ndawo.
It could be you.	Inokuba nguwe.
But that is not really necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko ngokwenene.
I suspect he is the problem.	Ndiyarhana ukuba nguye ingxaki.
Then he got out of the car.	Emva koko waphuma emotweni.
He did not want to leave.	Akazange afune ukuhamba.
Tell me everything.	Ndixelele konke.
there is something wrong with this.	kukho into engalunganga kule nto.
Not one, but two.	Hayi enye, kodwa ezimbini.
He said he did not know.	Uye wathi akazi.
He died the same way.	Wafa ngendlela efanayo.
Not so now, of course.	Akunjalo ngoku, kunjalo.
Here, right here.	Apha, kanye apha.
No, he thought, not long ago.	Hayi, wacinga, kungekudala.
I do it this way.	Ndenza ngolu hlobo.
She went to see her mother.	Waya kubona umama wakhe.
Not anytime soon, of course.	Hayi nanini na kungekudala, kunjalo.
My room at home.	Igumbi lam ekhaya.
But he was not by her side.	Kodwa wayengekho ecaleni kwakhe.
But it is not easy to buy.	Kodwa akukho lula ukuthenga.
Now you know all about me.	Ngoku uyazi konke ngam.
Not only here.	Hayi apha kuphela.
Stop saying that completely.	Yeka ukuthetha loo nto ngokupheleleyo.
He was not angry about that, though.	Akazange abe nomsindo ngaloo nto, nangona kunjalo.
So why call.	Ngoko ke kutheni umnxeba.
And what happened next.	Kwaye kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
And you are lucky to be able to walk.	Kwaye unethamsanqa ukuba uyakwazi ukuhamba.
You go with something.	Uhamba ngento.
That's it now.	Nto leyo ngoku.
This is not about what is better.	Oku akukho malunga nokuba yintoni engcono.
And that means you will have to stay here.	Kwaye oko kuthetha ukuba kuya kufuneka uhlale apha.
I don't even know if this is true.	Andazi nokuba yinyani na le.
You said you'd better go.	Ubuthe kungcono uhambe.
He did not think that last night he was wrong.	Khange acinge ukuba phezolo uhambe kakubi.
I'm not sure .	Andiqinisekanga .
It takes about.	Kuthatha malunga.
I never heard where he was.	Zange ndeva ukuba uphi.
Almost everyone did that.	Phantse wonke umntu wayenza loo nto.
That is our only responsibility.	Lowo ngumsebenzi wethu kuphela.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kunjalo kanye.
He would like to know the truth.	Angathanda ukwazi inyaniso.
I came here for you.	Ndize apha kuthi.
And what else? 	Kwaye yintoni enye?
This way, if you like.	Ngale ndlela, ukuba uyathanda.
You are doing very well here.	Uqhuba kakuhle kakhulu apha.
Really, you can't.	Ngokwenene, awukwazi.
I didn't want anything to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke nantoni na.
Or do too much.	Okanye wenze kakhulu.
It would be really nice to get there.	Kuya kuba kuhle ngokwenene ukuya apho.
She is not at work or at home.	Akakho emsebenzini okanye ekhaya.
Not so my parents.	Akunjalo abazali bam.
You already know why.	Sele uyazi ukuba kutheni.
It is very good to know that.	Kuhle kakhulu ukwazi oko.
I can't think or see now.	Andikwazi ukucinga okanye ndibone ngoku.
She has seen a doctor.	Uye wajonga ugqirha.
In our bed.	Ebhedini yethu.
After a while he sat down again.	Emva kwexesha wahlala kwakhona.
True, then.	Yinyani, ke.
I look forward to that again.	Ndijonge phambili kuloo nto kwakhona.
This is good to know.	Oku kuhle ukwazi.
This makes it difficult for her to make friends.	Oku kwenza kube nzima kuye ukwenza abahlobo.
Staying with us will be difficult.	Ukuhlala nathi kuya kuba nzima.
It does that well.	Kukwenza kakuhle oko.
I don't know how you do it.	Andiqondi ukuba uyenza njani.
True to the end.	Yinyani ekugqibeleni.
And you better go.	Kwaye kungcono uhambe.
Too bad, if you think about it.	Into embi, ukuba ucinga ngayo.
Or later at night.	Okanye kamva ebusuku.
So I am very tired.	Ngoko ndidiniwe kakhulu.
He knows we have to move fast.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
You are trying to make a decision.	Uzama ukwenza isigqibo.
There is a big picture.	Kukho umfanekiso omkhulu.
Then we will go a little further.	Emva koko siza kuhamba kancinci.
You will always read.	Uya kuhlala ufunda.
It will be much easier if.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukuba .
I just wanted him to leave.	Ndandifuna nje ukuba ahambe.
We will definitely be back.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kubuya .
No one will ever know about it.	Akukho mntu uya kuze azi ngayo.
Yes, that seemed possible.	Ewe, oko kwakubonakala kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
Well, he knows what happened to him.	Ewe, uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
After that, they lived in a large area.	Emva koko, bahlala kwindawo enkulu.
I can't say it the other way.	Andikwazi ukuyithetha ngenye indlela.
But this is it.	Kodwa lo nguye.
One came to the office.	Omnye weza eofisini.
He says another big one is likely to come.	Uthi enye enkulu inokuba iza.
He never told my father.	Akazange amxelele utata.
She feels bad though.	Uziva kakubi nangona kunjalo.
I want to tell my truth.	Ndifuna ukuthetha inyaniso yam.
Well, this is not the case at all.	Ewe, oku akunjalo konke konke.
I want a better picture.	Ndifuna umfanekiso ongcono.
He looked better.	Wayekhangeleka ngcono.
They went to him.	Baya kuye.
And the only reason.	Kwaye isizathu kuphela.
There was no waiting.	Kwakungekho kulinda.
So why are you sleeping.	Ngoko ke kutheni ulele.
That will mean what.	Ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni na.
And something.	Kwaye into.
Of course, it is very difficult to do this.	Kunjalo, kunzima kakhulu ukwenza oku.
But he hoped that it would not come to that.	Kodwa wayenethemba lokuba akuyi kufika kuloo nto.
No, never, never.	Hayi, soze, soze.
I'm not sure when it happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yenzeke nini.
I will totally do this.	Ndiza kuyenza ngokupheleleyo le nto.
Your location please.	Indawo yakho nceda.
Even if he doesn't want to.	Nokuba akafuni.
This is not his thing.	Asiyonto yakhe le.
I do that enough here.	Ndenza oko ngokwaneleyo apha.
This is impossible and impossible.	Oku akunakwenzeka kwaye akunakwenzeka.
You may be trying to buy time.	Usenokuba uzama ukuthenga ixesha.
It's her baby too.	Ngumntwana wakhe naye.
And he doesn't like the problem.	Kwaye akayithandi ingxaki.
However there was no place he would like to be.	Nangona kunjalo kwakungekho ndawo angathanda ukuba kuyo.
It goes well but it goes.	Ukuhamba kakuhle kodwa kuhamba.
I will do what it takes, no matter how long it takes.	Ndiza kwenza oko kuthatha, nokuba kuthatha ixesha elide kangakanani.
I think you are.	Ndicinga wena .
He said nothing to me.	Zange athethe nto kum.
He had to stay in the house.	Bekufanele ahlale endlini.
She has felt lonely and out of place.	Uye waziva eyedwa kwaye engekho ndawo.
You need to know all of this.	Kufuneka ukwazi konke oku.
Everything in the room.	Yonke into egumbini.
But he did not think he was looking away.	Kodwa akazange acinge ukuba ujonge ecaleni.
Now I know why.	Ngoku ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
No one sat down.	Akukho mntu wahlala.
Eventually he died of it.	Ekugqibeleni wafa ngayo.
I did something else.	Ndenze enye into.
Without anything.	Ngaphandle kwanto.
This is, however, not the case here.	Oku kunjalo, nangona kunjalo, akunjalo apha.
There is a lot of money for him.	Kukho imali eninzi kuye.
There is no better or worse.	Akukho ngcono okanye embi.
We will never do this again.	Asiyi kuphinda siyenze le nto.
I never thought I would go that way.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ndiza kuhamba ngaloo ndlela.
Moreover, it happens regularly.	Ngaphezu koko, kwenzeka rhoqo.
The question is what to do now.	Umbuzo kukuba wenze ntoni ngoku.
It happens all the time now and then.	Kwenzeka rhoqo ngoku kwaye emva koko.
You will find something there for sure.	Uya kufumana into apho ngokuqinisekileyo.
Very good indeed.	Kuhle kakhulu ngokwenene.
I don't have it in front of me.	Andinayo phambi kwam.
But, that happened.	Kodwa, oko kwenzeka.
So, fast to go today.	Ngoko, ngokukhawuleza ukuya namhlanje.
But in the end it will be better for him.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kuya kuba ngcono kuye.
And yes, we need some now.	Kwaye ewe, sifuna ezinye ngoku.
And you never know what it is.	Kwaye awuyazi ukuba yeyiphi.
It will be easier to stay for weeks.	Kuya kuba lula ukuhlala iiveki.
But that is definitely possible.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
And no one will ever come.	Kwaye akukho mntu uya kuze.
He can never go fast enough.	Akanakuze ahambe ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
And maybe yes.	Kwaye mhlawumbi ewe.
You never told me about him.	Zange undixelele ngaye.
And you, too.	Kwaye nawe, nawe.
I think this is clear.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kucacile.
Probably this book.	Mhlawumbi le ncwadi.
I hope all is well with you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba konke kulungile kuwe.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela oko.
Almost certainly.	Phantse ngokuqinisekileyo.
Some in front of you.	Abanye phambi kwakho.
I wish you knew.	Ndinqwenela ukuba ukwazi.
My father never talked about him.	Utata zange athethe ngaye.
The fact is, they never did.	Inyaniso kukuba akuzange kube njalo.
But to make time.	Kodwa ukwenza ixesha.
I want to be out there.	Ndifuna ukuba phaya phandle.
That's wrong.	Nto leyo engalunganga.
Nothing at all .	Akukho kwanto .
And, again, no.	Kwaye, kwakhona, hayi.
He took.	Wathatha .
I will continue, though.	Ndiya kuqhubeka, nokuba kunjalo.
And certainly alone.	Kwaye ngokuqinisekileyo wedwa.
Anyway, we'll be there.	Nangona kunjalo, siza kuba lapho.
Nice picture.	Umfanekiso mhle.
It is no small feat.	Asiyonto encinci.
Either way we have to do it.	Nayiphi na indlela kufuneka senze ngayo.
Or almost nothing.	Okanye phantse akukho nto.
Well now you have the answer.	Kulungile ngoku unayo impendulo.
I hope it will be the other way around.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kuya kuba ngenye indlela.
I couldn't say or anything.	Andikwazanga ukuthetha okanye nantoni na.
So now to you.	Ngoko ke ngoku kuwe.
Obviously there is something.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into.
It speaks ill of him, too.	Kuthetha kakubi ngaye, naye.
He definitely wanted to be there for that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayefuna ukuba lapho kuloo nto.
It will be good for both of us.	Kuya kuba kuhle kuthi sobabini.
In time you will succeed.	Emva kwexesha uya kuphumelela.
I don't want him to be my doctor.	Andifuni ukuba abe ngugqirha wam.
Indeed, it will last a long time.	Ngokwenene, iya kuhlala ixesha elide.
Wherever you go, you will not go alone.	Nokuba uya phi, awuyi kuhamba wedwa.
By the way .	Kwaye ke .
It’s a whole toy.	Yinto yokudlala yonke.
What did you tell your wife? 	Umxelele ntoni umfazi wakho?
Or maybe yes.	Okanye mhlawumbi ewe.
Or we will be, of course.	Okanye siya kuba, kunjalo.
This happened soon after him.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza emva kwakhe.
He thought he was playing with her.	Wayecinga ukuba udlala naye.
There is no food on the floor.	Akukho kutya phantsi.
She tried motherhood.	Wazama umama.
He has lain down.	Uye walala phambili.
He heard another one right behind him.	Weva omnye kanye emva kwakhe.
He thinks of nothing but himself.	Akacingi nto ngaphandle kwakhe.
He would need another.	Wayeza kufuna enye.
So maybe lunch.	Ngoko mhlawumbi isidlo sasemini.
At this time, there is no place.	Ngeli xesha, akukho ndawo.
I had to wait again.	Kwafuneka ndilinde kwakhona.
I have to speak fast.	Kufuneka ndithethe ngokukhawuleza.
That's probably why.	Yiloo nto mhlawumbi kutheni.
Mary loves it too.	UMariya uyayithanda, naye.
Nothing bad happened.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo embi.
Not good enough, though.	Akukho ngcono ngokwaneleyo, nangona kunjalo.
Not many people.	Hayi abantu abaninzi.
As you can one day.	Njengoko unokuba ngenye imini.
Don't think who he is.	Musa ukucinga ukuba ngubani.
He never did such a thing.	Akazange enze into enjalo.
But he has entered.	Kodwa uye wangena.
But it is good for you.	Kodwa kuhle kuwe.
But you do not have to go to it.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uye kuyo.
I wanted a gun.	Ndandifuna umpu.
But he knew it was necessary.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka.
Then he looked up and said.	Emva koko wajonga phezulu wathi.
Whatever happens, I am not the only one.	Kwenzeka nantoni na, ayindim kuphela.
Very party.	Itheko kakhulu.
I know, no reason.	Ndiyazi, akukho sizathu.
Some people, too.	Abanye abantu, kakhulu.
Or again maybe not.	Okanye ke kwakhona mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I wonder if it could be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba inokuba njalo.
Not life at all.	Hayi ubomi ngokupheleleyo.
But he is tired.	Kodwa udiniwe.
I wanted something new.	Bendifuna into entsha.
If you do not want to read this.	Ukuba awufuni ukufunda oku.
It takes three things to succeed.	Kuthatha izinto ezintathu ukuphumelela.
Maybe something bad happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho into engalunganga eyenzekileyo.
His wife did not know.	Umfazi wakhe akazange azi.
And my dad didn't want to talk about it.	Kwaye utata akazange afune ukuthetha ngayo.
There is a woman.	Kukho umfazi.
My life, my.	Ubomi bam, bam.
Later everyone wondered why.	Kamva wonke umntu wazibuza ukuba kutheni.
I'm not sure what his response might be.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba inokuba yintoni impendulo yakhe.
But you are lucky.	Kodwa unethamsanqa.
Or friends said.	Okanye nabahlobo wathi.
This seems to be going well.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kuhamba kakuhle.
Or maybe you think you do.	Okanye mhlawumbi ucinga ukuba uyayenza.
I wanted a voice.	Bendifuna ilizwi.
I tried upstairs.	Ndazama phezulu.
It seemed like a friend.	Kwakubonakala ngathi ngumhlobo.
And you look really good.	Kwaye ujonge kakuhle kakhulu.
This is a much bigger thing.	Le yinto enkulu ngakumbi.
He does not want to come to our place.	Akafuni ukuza kwindawo yethu.
Seeing what it is.	Ukubona oko kukho.
Not otherwise.	Akunjalo ngenye indlela.
Someone else will tell her.	Omnye umntu uya kumxelela.
I live in a car.	Ndihlala emotweni.
Not all the time, but enough.	Hayi lonke ixesha, kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
I don't know this place yet.	Andazi le ndawo okwangoku.
It's not our present, of course.	Ayisiyiyo okwangoku yethu, kunjalo.
I live well.	Ndihlala kakuhle.
I was thinking of getting a new job.	Ndandicinga ukufumana umsebenzi omtsha.
I would like to say three things.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha izinto ezintathu.
I had to go with him.	Bekufanele ndihambe naye.
Now, of course, he knew.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, wayesazi.
It doesn't have to be complicated.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba nzima kakhulu.
He saw a nice restaurant and went in.	Wabona indawo yokutyela entle waza wangena.
I won't be away for long.	Andiyi kuba kude nayo ixesha elide.
He comes with me almost everywhere.	Uza nam phantse yonke indawo.
He must be tired, but he is not.	Ufanele ukuba udiniwe, kodwa akanjalo.
He seems to be sleeping.	Ubonakala ngathi ulele nje.
He knew it very well.	Wayesazi kakuhle kakhulu.
Then there was no work.	Emva koko kwakungekho msebenzi.
However, there are no police.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho amapolisa.
And that seems like a good thing.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi yinto entle leyo.
That will not last.	Oko akuyi kuhlala.
Please check your dates.	Nceda ujonge imihla yakho.
He looked down at his shirt and turned to me.	Wajonga phantsi wajonga ihempe yakhe wabuyela kum.
We just have to go.	Kufuneka sihambe nje.
All right, we'll talk to you later.	Kulungile, siza kuthetha nawe kamva.
And then, well, nothing.	Kwaye ke, kulungile, akukho nto.
Because you read so much.	Ngenxa yokuba ufunda kakhulu.
He said to meet her outside.	Wathi ukudibana naye ngaphandle.
Better than you, maybe.	Ngcono kunawe, mhlawumbi.
I am the only one.	ndim kuphela .
But he kept doing strange things.	Kodwa ke waqhubeka esenza into engaqhelekanga.
But it is not me.	Kodwa ayindim.
Now, you're talking to me.	Ngoku, uthetha nam.
The problem is that it is difficult now.	Ingxaki kukuba kunzima ngoku.
That’s how everything looks to me.	Yiloo ndlela yonke into ebonakala ngayo kum.
It never was.	Zange ukhe ube njalo .
And so it is.	Kuthi kunjalo.
And this will be a lot of fun to read.	Kwaye oku kuya kuba mnandi kakhulu ukufunda.
Certainly not as easy as it seems.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
But it is impossible to stop.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuyeka.
That's my thing.	Nantso ke into yam.
Glad to read here again.	Ndiyavuya ukufunda apha kwakhona.
Only that, anything more.	Kuphela oko, nantoni na ngakumbi.
He comes to me from behind.	Uza kum ngasemva.
He decided it was time to leave.	Wagqiba kwelokuba lixesha lokuba ahambe.
Very, very early.	Kakhulu, ngaphambili kakhulu.
It's good to have you here.	Kulungile ukuba nawe apha.
I want to do something like this.	Ndifuna ukwenza into enje.
I hope not, but it could be.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo, kodwa kunokuba njalo.
And look down.	Kwaye ujonge phantsi.
And it came to pass,.	Kwaye kwenzeka, .
I want to make a phone call.	Ndifuna ukwenza umnxeba.
You look very good.	Ujonge kakuhle kakhulu.
This seems to me good.	Oku kubonakala kum kulungile.
You must expect success.	Kufuneka ulindele ukuphumelela.
Or it seems like at the time.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi ngelo xesha.
In the old way.	Ngendlela endala.
Not now, don't be like that.	Hayi ngoku, musa ukuba njalo.
All about him.	Konke ngaye.
He didn't know why, exactly, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni, kanye, kodwa wayesazi.
However, nothing happened.	Kodwa ke, akukho nto yenzekileyo.
Of course, it is difficult.	Kunjalo, kunzima.
I will not succeed.	Andiyi kuphumelela.
I came to talk to you.	Ndize kuthetha nawe.
There was no letter.	Kwakungekho ileta.
We want one thing.	Sifuna into enye.
He won't be back in a few hours.	Akayi kubuya iiyure ezimbalwa.
No one told her to do it.	Akukho mntu wamxelela ukuba enze loo nto.
Himself being a child.	Ngokwakhe ukuba ngumntwana.
I wanted one.	Ndandifuna enye.
He decided to do his best, and he is optimistic.	Wagqiba ukwenza konke okusemandleni akhe, kwaye unethemba.
I wanted to be a doctor.	Ndandifuna ukuba ngugqirha.
However it is not easy to do that.	Nangona kunjalo akukho lula ukwenza oko.
I don't know if I will ever do that.	Andazi ukuba ndiza kwenza njalo na.
We are leaving the park.	Siya epakini.
It is impossible to tell.	Akunakwenzeka ukuxelela.
Nobody up.	Akukho mntu phezulu.
This is possible, but difficult.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa kunzima.
Again, a little bit.	Kwakhona, kancinci kancinci.
Eating for life.	Ukutya ubomi bonke.
I tried to walk beside him.	Ndazama ukuhamba ecaleni kwakhe.
Well, you did not.	Ewe, awuzange.
He has left the room.	Uye waphuma egumbini.
It has to be this way.	Kufuneka kube ngolu hlobo.
And there is something else out there.	Kwaye kukho enye into ngaphandle.
And now you can have one.	Kwaye ngoku unokuba nayo enye.
Now, anyone can do it.	Ngoku, nabani na angayenza.
You go home if you want.	Uya ekhaya ukuba uyafuna.
I needed my help.	Bendifuna uncedo lwam.
It’s all about time.	Konke oku malunga nexesha.
I am very happy to win today.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuphumelela namhlanje.
It takes time to get to a place.	Kuthatha ixesha ukuya kwindawo.
I'll be down.	Ndiza kuba phantsi.
She did not know how she felt.	Wayengazi ukuba uziva njani.
But that work did not succeed.	Kodwa loo msebenzi awuzange uphumelele.
Sure it's hard, but it is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
A little something about me.	Into encinci ngam.
Doing a very good job at it, too.	Ukwenza umsebenzi omhle kakhulu ngayo, nayo.
She went to my room.	Uye egumbini lam.
I want you to look at me really.	Ndifuna ujonge kum nyani.
He looked up, but not long enough.	Wajonga phezulu, kodwa kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
He likes to think constantly.	Uyathanda ukucinga njalo.
She saw a doctor.	Wabona ugqirha.
He said no.	Wathi khange.
If not, it's much better for you.	Ukuba akunjalo, kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
There, forward.	Apho, phambili.
I really didn't know why.	Ngokwenene ndandingazi ukuba kutheni.
I will be there with him.	Ndiya kuba lapho naye.
Stop doing something else.	Yeka ukuyenza enye into.
Yes, thank you.	Ewe, enkosi kunjalo.
And three not.	Kwaye ezintathu hayi.
I'm glad it isn't, you know, another house.	Ndiyavuya ukuba akunjalo, uyazi, enye indlu.
You can do this well.	Uyakwazi ukwenza oku kakuhle.
It will take about.	Iza kuthatha malunga.
My parents live together.	Abazali bam bahlala kunye.
No one too much.	Akukho mntu kakhulu.
No one wanted anything else.	Akukho mntu wayefuna enye into.
I don't think we should.	Andiqondi ukuba sifanele.
I just wanted to play and read.	Ndandifuna ukudlala nje ndifunde.
I came here to do my job.	Ndize apha ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
That, we will do it.	Oko, siza kuyenza.
I can't do my homework.	Andikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi wam wesikolo.
I don't want to do it again.	Andifuni kuyenza kwakhona.
Finally out.	Ekugqibeleni ukuphuma.
Yes, it seemed to us.	Ewe, kwakubonakala ngathi.
Did you know that.	Ubusazi ukuba.
I like the phone.	Ndiyayithanda ifowuni.
He thought it was hard.	Wacinga ukuba nzima.
I know that now, of course.	Ndiyazi ukuba ngoku, kunjalo.
Could it be you.	Ngaba inokuba nguwe.
She’s smart, though.	Ukrelekrele, nangona kunjalo.
Do it now.	Ukwenza ngoku.
I think you did a really great job.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze umsebenzi omkhulu ngokwenene.
He knows nothing about money.	Akazi nto ngemali.
Good answer.	Impendulo elungileyo.
He received a lot of attention.	Wafumana ingqalelo eninzi.
Then up.	Emva koko phezulu.
But no one I know really likes it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda ngokwenene.
All in all no problem.	Konke akukho ngxaki.
It's hard here.	Kunzima apha.
Or any problem.	Okanye nayiphi na ingxaki.
You have to stay for a week.	Kufuneka uhlale iveki.
They sit in the back of the car.	Bahlala emva emotweni.
I have to leave soon.	Kufuneka ndihambe kungekudala.
Someone else has everything.	Omnye umntu unayo yonke into.
Then the woman.	Emva koko umfazi.
All this for me.	Konke oku kum.
As you did not know.	Njengokuba awuzange wazi.
I know how it happened and why this happened.	Ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani kwaye kutheni oku kwenzeka.
I have made a beautiful house.	Ndenze indlu entle.
He just looked at the big picture.	Wajonga nje umfanekiso omkhulu.
He did whatever he wanted.	Wenza nantoni na ayifunayo.
He came to you first.	Weza kuwe kuqala.
He got into bed.	Wangena ebhedini.
But we'll see !.	Kodwa siza kubona!.
I think everyone knows it.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi.
He may not be in her, at this time.	Usenokuba akakho kuye, ngeli xesha.
He immediately fled the scene.	Ngoko nangoko wabaleka kuloo ndawo.
Well, we never did.	Ewe, asizange senze njalo.
He spoke like that.	Wathetha ngolo hlobo.
If a person has a problem, he should stop.	Ukuba umntu unengxaki, kufuneka ayeke.
I want to try everything.	Ndifuna ukuzama yonke into.
It wasn’t about me.	Kwakungekho ngam.
You will find someone, eventually.	Uya kufumana umntu, ekugqibeleni.
I mean think.	Ndithetha ukucinga.
Without you, he would be nothing.	Ngaphandle kwakho, akayi kuba yinto.
Really and fast.	Ngokwenene kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo .
Said the father.	Wathetha utata.
And you have to go.	Kwaye kufuneka uhambe.
I'd like to take the problem with you on that.	Ndingathanda ukuthatha ingxaki nawe ngaloo nto.
Getting there will not be easy, but you can do it.	Ukufika apho akuyi kuba lula, kodwa ungayenza.
As he does every day.	Njengoko esenza yonke imihla.
I thought that was strange.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto engaqhelekanga leyo.
Good for lunch.	Ilungile ngesidlo sasemini.
You want to know what's coming.	Uyathanda ukwazi into ezayo.
I couldn't take one.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthatha enye.
Surely that would seem to be the case here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kuya kubonakala kunjalo apha.
We'll talk about him.	Siza kuthetha ngaye.
Or he can't do it.	Okanye akanakuyenza.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi.
I'll go with that.	Ndiza kuhamba naloo nto.
That is not possible, of course.	Oko akunakwenzeka, kunjalo.
You have become a good friend.	Ube ngumhlobo olungileyo.
She didn't want to talk to him anymore.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha naye kwakhona.
He didn't know what, if anything, could be.	Wayengazi ukuba, ukuba kukho nantoni na, inokuba yintoni na.
He hoped to be alone.	Wayenethemba lokuba nguye yedwa.
Tell me one more.	Ndixelele enye.
Why is there another.	Kutheni kukho enye.
Not now, but soon.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa kungekudala.
It seems almost the same way.	Kubonakala ngathi phantse indlela efanayo.
Inside everything.	Ngaphakathi kuyo yonke into.
I have been a good person.	Ndibe ngumntu olungileyo.
He looked at his living space.	Wajonga kwindawo yakhe yokuhlala.
It should be hard to go that way.	Kumele kube nzima ukuhamba ngolo hlobo.
I'll get something.	Ndiza kufumana into.
The children stay there all night.	Abantwana bahlala apho ubusuku bonke.
One has to do that clearly.	Umntu kufuneka enze loo nto ngokucacileyo.
Or like me.	Okanye njengam.
I need help with this.	Ndifuna uncedo kule.
Now it looks like he is coming.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi uza kuza.
Down where we go.	Phantsi apho siya khona.
That, or money.	Oko, okanye imali.
I don't have it here.	Andinayo apha.
It’s not easy, but it is.	Akukho lula, kodwa kunjalo.
However, he knew.	Nangona kunjalo, wayesazi.
Let me tell you - it was a scary place.	Makhe ndikuxelele, akukho nto.
Sorry, but he does not want to.	Uxolo, kodwa akafuni.
So everyone.	Ngoko wonke umntu.
I forgot now.	Ndilibele ngoku.
Just like my dad.	Kanye njengokuba utata wam.
And really, it's just that way.	Kwaye ngenene, kungcono nje ngaloo ndlela.
Not time or place.	Hayi ixesha okanye indawo.
He works very hard on it.	Usebenza nzima kakhulu kuyo.
Sorry, maybe.	Uxolo, mhlawumbi.
I want to make a new way.	Ndifuna ukwenza indlela entsha.
There was no danger here.	Kwakungekho ngozi apha.
Something in it.	Enye into kuyo.
And he is sitting alone.	Kwaye uhleli yedwa.
But before he did.	Kodwa ngaphambi kokuba ayenze.
It will also be much easier to make money.	Kwakhona kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukwenza imali.
He did almost everything else.	Wenze malunga nayo yonke enye into.
He did not come.	Akazange afike .
I'm not sure you did.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyenzile.
Absolutely! 	Ngokuqinisekileyo!
I just looked back.	Ndijonge nje emva.
I want to be here for her.	Ndifuna ukuba lapha ngenxa yakhe.
He was talking about it.	Wayethetha ngayo .
And he learned everything.	Kwaye wafunda yonke into.
Everyone was afraid of each other.	Wonke umntu wayesoyika omnye.
Well, maybe so.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Because this is really possible.	Kuba oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
Not a few days.	Hayi iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Going once.	Ukuhamba kanye.
One day he was not at breakfast.	Ngenye imini wayengekho kwisidlo sakusasa.
I went everywhere.	Ndaya yonke indawo.
You told your wife.	Uxelele umfazi wakho.
He didn't know then.	Wayengazi ngoko .
He wants to know everything you need to know.	Unqwenela ukwazi nantoni na ekufuneka uyazi.
They live in it.	Bahlala kuyo.
We need someone.	Sifuna umntu.
He wasn't in that.	Wayengekho kuloo nto.
Obviously really.	Ngokucacileyo ngokwenene.
I know what will happen, in the end.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni, ekugqibeleni.
Staying in this state is impossible.	Ukuhlala kule meko akunakwenzeka.
He will do that.	Uya kwenza oko.
He just wanted to be your friend.	Wayefuna nje ukuba ngumhlobo wakho.
He wondered what death would be like.	Wayecinga ukuba ukufa kuya kuba njani.
And everyone does it.	Kwaye wonke umntu uyayenza.
He spoke clearly.	Wayethetha ngokucacileyo.
Almost always for the better.	Phantse rhoqo ukuba ngcono.
Or to be difficult.	Okanye ukuba nzima.
It just means you will eat very little.	Kuthetha nje ukuba uya kutya kancinci kakhulu.
And he knew a lot about her.	Kwaye wayesazi kakhulu ngaye.
I did not go very far.	Khange ndihambe kakhulu.
If you do not want to do this, we will not.	Ukuba awufuni ukwenza oku, asiyi.
This is not for you.	Oku akukho kuwe.
Nobody loves money.	Akukho mntu uthanda imali.
You do not know where you are.	Awuyazi ukuba uphi.
Well, you know all about it.	Ewe, uyazi konke malunga naloo nto.
So this had to happen.	Ngoko oku kwafuneka kwenzeke.
they say.	bathi.
He would like to know everything.	Angathanda ukwazi yonke into.
He has done that now for her.	Wenze lonto ngoku kuye.
I never went to class.	Andizange ndiye eklasini.
Just work.	Umsebenzi nje.
Although for me that would be a big deal.	Nangona kum oko bekuya kuba yinto enkulu.
I thought they would stay with him.	Ndandicinga ukuba baza kuhlala naye.
Yeah, you got here, all right.	Ewe, ufike apha, kulungile.
We will come later.	Siza kuza emva koko.
It's just that everything happened so fast.	Kuphela nje ukuba yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
Sure, it could be anyone.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, inokuba nabani na.
He appeared before her.	Wabonakala phambi kwakhe.
Everyone does their own thing.	Wonke umntu wenza into yakhe.
And his mind is a strange thing.	Kwaye ingqondo yakhe yinto engaqhelekanga.
He was afraid most of the time.	Wayesoyika ixesha elininzi.
Not all the way, just a little bit.	Hayi yonke indlela, nje kancinci.
Sorry for any inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo nayiphi na ingxaki.
He really did.	Uyenzile ngokwenene.
The word.	Ilizwi .
I know she is fine now.	Ndiyamazi ulungile ngoku.
And he is serious about it.	Kwaye uzimisele ngayo.
But really not about us.	Kodwa ngokwenene akukho ngathi.
I hope you will want to meet me, too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kufuna ukudibana nam, nawe.
Not controversial.	Hayi utata.
Football with me.	Ibhola kunye nam.
He is lucky for you.	Unethamsanqa kuwe.
I also knew why.	Ndandisazi nokuba kutheni.
He thought there was something wrong with me.	Wayecinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga ngam.
But another problem for me.	Kodwa enye ingxaki yam.
I didn't think much of it at first.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo ekuqaleni.
If you do not want to leave, do not.	Ukuba awufuni ukuhamba, musa.
Before he left.	Phambi kokuba ahambe.
Too much for everything.	Kakhulu kakhulu kuyo yonke into.
I sit next to him and do the same.	Ndihlala ecaleni kwakhe ndenza njalo.
I would like to tell you more.	Ndingathanda ukukuxelela ngakumbi.
Let me give you one.	Makhe ndinike enye.
Not today anyway.	Hayi namhlanje kunjalo.
Everyone wants to be a better person.	Wonke umntu uthanda ukuba ngumntu ongcono.
That's it, and you already know it.	Yiyo nje, kwaye sele uyayazi loo nto.
Thus we have.	Ngaloo ndlela siye .
You know what that is.	Uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
I'm really happy for him.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene kuye.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba.
And come again.	Kwaye uze kwakhona.
It is impossible to do anything.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza nantoni na.
He was really thinking too much.	Wayecinga kakhulu ngenene.
Why should he be something else ?.	Kutheni kufuneka abe enye into?.
I don't even know if he does.	Andazi nokuba uyayenza na.
This is my first visit to town.	Ndiyaqala ukuza edolophini.
To talk about it.	Ukuze athethe ngayo.
Not her mother, though.	Hayi umama wakhe, nangona kunjalo.
So he lives alone.	Ngoko uhlala yedwa.
He will want this for you.	Uya kufuna oku kuwe.
There is a car there.	Kukho imoto apho.
If it is true then it is true.	Ukuba yinyani ke yinyani.
He knew it wouldn't be good.	Wayesazi ukuba akuyi kuba kuhle.
So it is possible.	Ngoko kunokwenzeka.
Yeah, everything the same for me.	Ewe, yonke into enye kum.
We won't do that tonight.	Asiyi kuyenza loo nto ngokuhlwanje.
There is really no need.	Akukho mfuneko ngokwenene.
So my man was not there.	Ngoko umntu wam wayengekho.
I would like to read that.	Ndingathanda ukufunda oko.
Maybe it will take two.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuthatha ezimbini.
I did the same thing recently.	Ndenze into efanayo kungekudala.
I need help with everything.	Ndifuna uncedo ngayo yonke into.
he advised.	wacebisa.
We'll get another one sooner or later.	Siza kufumana enye kungekudala okanye kamva.
Better than nothing either, though.	Kungcono kunokuba akukho nto mhlawumbi, kodwa.
That's the place.	Nantso ke indawo.
One has to do something.	Umntu kufuneka enze into ethile.
He looks old.	Ukhangeleka kudala.
We need to have this now.	Kufuneka sibe nayo le nto ngoku.
Now, that would not be possible.	Ngoku, oko akunakwenzeka.
No, and you know it well.	Akunjalo, kwaye uyazi kakuhle.
In front of me, not behind me.	Phambi kwam, hayi ngasemva.
Just stop doing things.	Yeka nje ukwenza izinto.
Very large house.	Indlu enkulu kakhulu.
Now we probably know more.	Ngoku mhlawumbi siyazi kakhulu.
It is difficult for us to know now.	Kunzima kuthi ukwazi ngoku.
And you think of him.	Kwaye ucinga naye.
Not that he is.	Hayi ukuba nguye.
He walked over and got into it.	Wahamba phambili wangena kuyo.
Nothing was visible.	Akukho kwakubonakala.
This is clear to see.	Oku kucacile ukubona.
It probably won't be long.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba ixesha elide.
And now he learned why.	Kwaye ngoku wafunda ukuba kutheni.
This time you did.	Ngeli xesha wenze.
However, it happens at night.	Nangona kunjalo, kwenzeka ebusuku.
But man never thought of it, you know.	Kodwa umntu akazange acinge ngayo, uyazi.
He came to talk to her.	Weza kuthetha naye.
I can't do this right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto ngoku.
And my job here.	Kwaye umsebenzi wam apha.
That's exactly right.	Oko kunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
After you do.	Emva kokuba wenze.
Maybe something else happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
Nothing will happen to you.	Akukho nto iza kwenzeka kuwe.
Not up, really.	Hayi phezulu, ngokwenene.
I said the wrong thing.	Ndithethe into engalunganga.
We will not be able to see everything.	Asiyi kukwazi ukubona yonke into.
You did something wrong.	Wenze into embi ngayo.
What happens, everyone.	Kwenzeka ntoni, wonke umntu.
Or debt.	Okanye ityala.
So not for long then.	Ngoko hayi ixesha elide ngoko.
In your house.	Endlwini yakho.
He later told me.	Kamva undixelele.
I want to know the truth about myself.	Ndifuna ukwazi inyaniso ngam.
We know how this happened.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
I knew what this would mean.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni oku.
And then of course, yes, absolutely.	Kwaye ke ngokuqinisekileyo, ewe, ngokupheleleyo.
It is to be alone.	Kukuba yedwa.
And then tonight.	Kwaye ke ngokuhlwanje.
And there is someone.	Kwaye kukho umntu.
But not once.	Kodwa hayi kanye.
However, nothing could be further from the truth.	Nangona kunjalo, akukho nto inokuba yinyani ngakumbi.
This requires an answer.	Oku kufuna impendulo.
I hope you will come and stay again soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuza kwaye uhlale kwakhona kungekudala.
Everyone did it in the beginning.	Wonke umntu wenza ekuqaleni.
Neither did you.	Nawe awuzange wenze njalo.
Great thing, something.	Into enkulu, into .
He just arrived.	Wafika nje.
He will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba abe.
Or his eyes.	Okanye amehlo akhe.
She is absolutely right.	Ulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Maybe it happened to you now.	Mhlawumbi kwenzeka kuwe ngoku.
Not a good thing.	Hayi into entle.
That takes work.	Oko kuthatha umsebenzi.
He seemed strange to her.	Wayebonakala engaqhelekanga kuye.
Don't, please don't.	Musa, nceda musa.
Nobody ever did this.	Akukho mntu wakha wayenza le nto.
Today if possible.	Namhlanje ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He went out to the house.	Ukhe waphuma waya endlini.
Anyone would like to be with him.	Nabani na angathanda ukuba naye.
Finding my place.	Ukufumana indawo yam.
Something very unusual happened here yesterday.	Kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga apha izolo.
Now there is no need.	Ngoku akukho mfuneko.
I'm talking to you.	Ndithetha nam.
Two days in a new job.	Iintsuku ezimbini emsebenzini omtsha.
That is the time again.	Lixesha kwakhona elo .
It will always be difficult.	Kuya kuhlala kunzima.
He pretends to read a book.	Wenza ngathi ufunda incwadi.
Of course, learning takes a long time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ukufunda kuthatha ixesha elide.
And you probably won't want to talk.	Kwaye mhlawumbi awuyi kufuna ukuthetha.
Right now there is very little money.	Ngoku ngoku kukho imali encinci.
My father did but.	Utata wayenza kodwa.
Seeing anything.	Ukubona nantoni na.
Because he did not want to.	Ngenxa yokuba akazange afune.
He told me that last night.	Undixelele oko phezolo.
She wanted to go to her bed.	Wayefuna ukuya ebhedini yakhe.
No, he wanted to know.	Hayi, wayefuna ukwazi.
Most people live.	Abantu abaninzi bahlala.
You learn to simplify.	Ufunda ukwenza lula.
I'll wait until later.	Ndiza kulinda ngaphambili.
Ready to make a car with him.	Ukulungele ukwenza imoto naye.
He did enough.	Wenza ngokwaneleyo.
He has not been around for years.	Akakho phantse iminyaka.
It's my man.	Ngumntu wam.
I just want an answer.	Ndifuna nje impendulo.
You mean someone.	Uthetha umntu.
There is that, too.	Kukho loo nto, nayo.
They will come here.	Baza kuza apha.
He said money.	Uthe imali.
Then he rebuilt.	Emva koko wakha kwakhona.
He wanted to do things for her.	Wayefuna ukwenza izinto kuye.
I hope your work works fast, too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba umsebenzi wakho usebenza ngokukhawuleza, naye.
Just, really really soon.	Nje, ngokwenene ngokwenene kungekudala.
It’s all there, but it’s not there.	Kukho konke, kodwa akukho apho.
And he really is.	Kwaye unjalo ngokwenene.
You know, really.	Uyazi, ngokwenene.
You probably know that.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
Going to school every day.	Ukuya esikolweni yonke imihla.
He knew her too.	Wayesazi naye.
Problem at work.	Ingxaki emsebenzini.
One thing.	Into enye.
You will know it soon.	Uya kukwazi ngokukhawuleza.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma wavuma.
I thought you wanted to go with me.	Ndandicinga ukuba ufuna ukuhamba nam.
I mean right here, now.	Ndithetha kanye apha, ngoku.
But that's all.	Kodwa yiloo nto kuphela.
He wants to make a party.	Ufuna ukwenza itheko.
I thought it would be different.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba ngenye indlela.
This is a big, big thing for us.	Le yinto enkulu, enkulu kuthi.
He wanted to swim.	Wayefuna ukuqubha.
Food becomes easier.	Ukutya kuba lula.
You can really do this.	Ungayenza ngenene le nto.
He never stopped working on it.	Akazange ayeke ukusebenza kuyo.
Give me everything.	Ndinike konke.
He really knows that good work.	Wazi ngokwenene loo msebenzi mhle.
Some will succeed, some will succeed.	Abanye baya kuphumelela, abanye baya kuphumelela.
I thought something.	Ndikhe ndacinga into.
He wanted more children.	Wayefuna abantwana abaninzi.
So there is no problem with that.	Ngoko ke akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
Behind him there is a way.	Emva kwakhe kukho indlela.
Or he did, of course.	Okanye wenza, kunjalo.
I couldn't talk about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
He should try hard to do this.	Kufuneka azame ngamandla ukwenza oku.
Also a great job.	Kwakhona umsebenzi omkhulu.
Why this should be the case, no one knows.	Kutheni le nto kufuneka kube njalo, akukho mntu uyazi.
All is well and good.	Konke kulungile kwaye kuhle.
He never tried to say that.	Akazange azame ukuyithetha loo nto.
Maybe later, someday.	Mhlawumbi kamva, ngenye imini.
He suggested that she would like to stay there.	Wacebisa ukuba angathanda ukuhlala apho.
But no one thinks about that anymore.	Kodwa akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto kwakhona.
I think the name.	Ndicinga igama.
and, and, and.	kunye, kunye, kunye.
Well, he thought, he looks like me.	Ewe, wacinga, ufana nam.
Not a doctor.	Hayi ugqirha.
I know now why.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba kutheni.
There is something to do.	Kukho into yokwenza.
He did not agree with the other.	Akazange avume omnye.
Everyone wants to help everyone out.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukunceda wonke umntu ngaphandle.
Why did you come here? 	Kutheni uze apha?
And yes, that's fine.	Kwaye ewe, ilungile.
You're a little better today.	Ungcono kancinci namhlanje.
Then he knew why.	Emva koko wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
He himself lives in such a place.	Naye ngokwakhe uhlala kwindawo enjalo.
He won't go very long.	Akayi kuhamba ixesha elide kakhulu.
Years with him.	Iminyaka kunye naye.
Or maybe to me.	Okanye mhlawumbi kum.
He felt bad about it.	Waziva kakubi ngayo.
He went into his bedroom.	Wangena egumbini lakhe lokulala.
Mary lives with you so no thank you.	UMarry uhlala nawe ngoko hayi enkosi.
You must be my friend.	Ufanele ukuba ngumhlobo wam.
But, not always.	Kodwa, hayi rhoqo.
He did not, however, go far.	Akazange, nangona kunjalo, aye kude.
He felt like this.	Waziva enje.
Maybe you're here just because you're interested.	Mhlawumbi ulapha nje kuba unomdla.
Well, that's right, three.	Ewe, kunjalo, ezintathu.
It seems like everyone knows everyone except me.	Kubonakala ngathi wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu ngaphandle kwam.
That's about.	Oko malunga.
It seemed to him.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuye.
He may not be here.	Usenokuba akakho apha.
We will definitely do this.	Ngokwenene siza kuyenza le nto.
Just stop reading.	Yeka nje ukufunda.
Or maybe this is me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim lo.
And your place.	Kwaye indawo yakho.
This would be, of course, impossible.	Oku kuya kuba, ke, akunakwenzeka.
Also doing a great job.	Kwakhona ukwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
After bedtime.	Emva kwexesha lokulala.
And back, together.	Kwaye emva, kunye kunye.
He left immediately.	Uhambe ngokukhawuleza.
Everyone else will do it, not you.	Bonke abanye baya kwenza, hayi wena.
A better person.	Umntu ongcono.
He must have been up all night.	Umele ukuba wahamba ubusuku bonke.
There is plenty to keep you busy.	Kukho okuninzi apho ukuze uhlale uxakekile.
He did a good thing, too.	Wenza into entle, naye.
Later, he left.	Kamva, wemka.
He later apologized.	Kamva wacela uxolo.
It's so nice to be there.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba lapho.
He died here.	Wafa apha.
I didn't want any.	Ndandingafuni namnye.
This will not end tomorrow.	Oku akuyi kuphela ngomso.
No you are busy.	Hayi uxakekile.
Nothing will happen at all.	Akukho nto iya kwenzeka konke konke.
It seems like now is the time to do it, though.	Kubonakala ngathi ngoku lixesha lokwenza oko, nangona kunjalo.
He might not have said anything, you know.	Usenokuba akazange athethe nto, uyazi.
I'm going to have to think of something.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge into.
I know he doesn't know.	Ndiyamazi ukuba akazi.
Not that he doesn't want to go.	Hayi ukuba akafuni ukuya.
There was really nothing.	Kwakungekho nto ngokwenene.
I will do it next week.	Ndiza kuyenza kwiveki ezayo.
Nobody wants this thing to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba kwenzeke into enje.
It's done now.	Yenziwe ngoku ngoku.
I didn't see a problem.	Khange ndibone ngxaki.
No, not just you, but.	Hayi, hayi wena kanye, kodwa .
It means he did not.	Kuthetha ukuba akazange.
You can't play.	Awukwazi ukudlala.
I know exactly when the money will come.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba imali iza kufika nini.
I'll take it, for sure.	Ndiza kuthatha, ngokuqinisekileyo.
How hard it is for him.	Kunzima kangakanani kuye.
You would not even know why.	Ubungazi nokuba kutheni.
Okay now, though.	Kulungile ngoku, nangona kunjalo.
They will do it for now.	Baza kwenza okwangoku.
But he went there.	Kodwa waya khona .
I don't want to say bad things about him.	Andifuni kuthetha kakubi ngaye.
Please check once.	Nceda ujonge kube kanye.
He promised that no one would want anything.	Wathembisa ukuba akukho mntu uya kufuna nantoni na.
You will not end.	Awuyi kuphela.
He stays in the hospital for many days.	Uhlala iintsuku ezininzi esibhedlele.
It's good to be there.	Kulungile ukuba phaya.
This time he looked up.	Ngeli xesha wajonga phezulu.
But this time, there is no need.	Kodwa ngeli xesha, akukho mfuneko.
Then, however, he tried.	Emva koko, nangona kunjalo, wazama.
I feel human again.	Ndiziva ndingumntu kwakhona.
I have to go again tomorrow.	Kufuneka ndihambe kwakhona ngomso.
I'm glad your son is feeling better.	Ndiyavuya ukuba unyana wakho uziva engcono.
But you know and you know.	Kodwa uyazi kwaye uyazi.
But he certainly would come, of course.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuza, kunjalo.
To us, not so much.	Kuthi, hayi kakhulu.
He did not speak immediately.	Khange athethe ngoko nangoko.
That's his man.	Ngumntu wakhe lowo.
The fact is that it is not.	Inyaniso kukuba akunjalo.
Soon all of this will be gone.	Kungekudala yonke le nto iza kuphela.
Never before have so many things happened so suddenly.	Zange nanini na ngaphambili kwenzeke izinto ezininzi ngokukhawuleza.
A gift to him.	Isipho kuye.
There was no better alternative.	Kwakungekho enye engcono.
There is a voice, and it is a person.	Kukho ilizwi, kwaye ngumntu.
You never thought.	Zange ucinge.
And then he does.	Kwaye ke uyayenza.
Because there is a question.	Kuba kukho umbuzo.
I knew nothing, or anyone.	Ndandingazi nto, okanye nabani na.
We know he is.	Siyazi ukuba nguye.
He will do it tomorrow.	Uza kuyenza ngomso.
You will probably succeed in everything.	Mhlawumbi uya kuphumelela yonke into.
If not, you do not need to know.	Ukuba akunjalo, akukho mfuneko yokuba wazi.
Not then or later.	Hayi ngoko okanye kamva.
Will you do it?	Ngaba uya kuyenza?
You have to go and do another one.	Kufuneka uhambe wenze enye.
It is better, perhaps, to.	Kungcono, mhlawumbi, ukuba .
Maybe someone will be you.	Mhlawumbi umntu uya kuba nguwe.
There is no future for it.	Akukho kamva kuyo.
I've never been here before.	Andizange ndiye apha ngaphambili.
And a lot of the time with me.	Kwaye ixesha elininzi kunye nam.
He didn't want any more.	Akazange afune ngakumbi.
Now where did you go.	Ngoku uye phi.
You may be thinking, this is going too far.	Usenokuba ucinga, oku kuhamba kakhulu.
He asked where he should go to learn the way.	Wabuza ukuba ufanele aye phi ukuze afunde indlela.
I think we will succeed there.	Ndicinga ukuba siya kuphumelela apho.
We know it is possible.	Siyazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
But like, not so much yet.	Kodwa njengokuba, hayi kakhulu nangoku.
He is completely gone.	Uhambe ngokupheleleyo.
He may have thought so.	Usenokuba wayecinga ngolu hlobo.
And you are good at that.	Kwaye ulungile kuloo nto.
Then he came back to me again.	Emva koko wabuyela kum kwakhona.
He knows we are coming to him.	Uyazi ukuba siza kuye.
All is well so far.	Konke kulungile kude kube ngoku.
We need to be together in this.	Kufuneka sibe kunye kule nto.
As we have done.	Njengoko senze.
I want to know the truth.	Ndifuna ukwazi inyaniso.
There was no later.	Kwakungekho kamva.
Everyone wanted to stay.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuhlala.
Being alone with him.	Ukuba naye yedwa.
But this is it.	Kodwa yile.
You should have said something, said something.	Bekufanele wenze into, uthethe into.
That he knew all the time.	Oko wayesazi lonke ixesha.
Now, that's all right.	Ngoku, konke kulungile.
If someone is usually me.	Ukuba umntu udla ngokuba ndim.
I have never told anyone before.	Zange ndixelele mntu ngaphambili.
He has gone to college.	Uye wahamba waya ekholejini.
Or you have.	Okanye unayo.
He never stopped and never went to her.	Zange ayeke khange aye kuye.
And we want only one.	Kwaye sifuna enye kuphela.
At the moment, he doesn't like it very much.	Okwangoku, akayithandi kakhulu.
I am here for you here because of you.	Ndilapha ngenxa yakho apha ngenxa yakho.
I would like these books.	Ndingathanda ezi ncwadi.
Just doing it.	Ukwenza nje.
Case.	Ityala .
That would take a week.	Oko bekuya kuthatha iveki.
Yes old.	Ewe mdala.
No one should know what is going on in our house.	Akukho mntu umele azi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni endlwini yethu.
Driving almost everywhere.	Ukuqhuba phantse yonke indawo.
I thought you did very well.	Bendicinga ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
I can't get out.	Andikwazi ukuphuma ngaphandle.
You have to move on no matter what happens.	Kufuneka uye phambili nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
He says yes it is.	Uthi ewe kunjalo.
But only the first call.	Kodwa kuphela umnxeba wokuqala.
I feel strong.	Ndiziva ngamandla.
Tell me about it.	Ndixelele ngale nto.
He left in the morning.	Wemka ekuseni.
Nobody wants it to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba kwenzeke.
He didn't want me to know that.	Wayengafuni ukuba ndiyazi loo nto.
We know how.	Siyazi ukuba njani.
There is only one.	Kukho kuphela.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba njalo.
Of course you do not know.	Ewe awuyazi.
It is very difficult to catch these.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuzibamba ezi.
I want to be the first.	Ndifuna ukuba ngowokuqala .
He just wasn't there.	Wayengekho nje.
He wanted to get out because he wanted to be more successful.	Wayefuna ukuphuma kuba wayefuna ukuphumelela ngakumbi.
And he went in before her.	Wangena ke ngoku phambi kwakhe.
I read this somewhere.	Ndifunde oku kwindawo ethile.
Or his name.	Okanye igama lakhe.
No one is inside the car.	Akukho mntu ngaphakathi emotweni.
Thus, only one word will remain.	Ngaloo ndlela, kuya kuhlala kuphela igama elinye.
But you stay, if possible.	Kodwa uhlala, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
You haven't been in it in a long time.	Awuzange ube kuyo ixesha elide.
Besides, he never stopped.	Ngaphandle koko, akazange ayeke.
The opportunity to be a new person.	Ithuba lokuba ngumntu omtsha.
I think soon.	Ndiyacinga kungekudala .
Do not think that he knows it all, and he does not know anything.	Musa ukucinga ukuba uyazi yonke, kwaye akazi nto.
Like all of us.	Ngathi sonke.
And this happens all the time.	Kwaye oku kwenzeka ngalo lonke ixesha.
Her mother is a teacher.	Umama wakhe ngutitshala.
Not all at once.	Akunjalo konke ngexesha elinye.
After that, he wanted to meet his friends.	Emva koko, wayefuna ukudibana nabahlobo bakhe.
We did it with him.	Senze naye.
I thought that was possible.	Ndandicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
He got out of it all.	Waphuma kuyo yonke loo nto.
He got into his bed.	Wangena ebhedini yakhe.
But not only in his bed.	Kodwa hayi ebhedini yakhe kuphela.
But no one thinks so.	Kodwa akukho mntu ucinga ngolo hlobo.
You will see flowers.	Uya kubona iintyatyambo.
Tell me now what happened.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
He did not want her to think about work.	Wayengafuni ukuba acinge ngomsebenzi.
He admitted that he needed help.	Wavuma ukuba ufuna uncedo.
Then you will have friends.	Emva koko uya kuba nabahlobo.
He obviously thought that was a good idea.	Ngokucacileyo wayecinga ukuba licebo elihle elo.
Thinking too much, not too little.	Ukucinga kakhulu, hayi kancinci.
So it will certainly be.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
Like, a little bit.	Njengokuba, kancinci.
No problem after that.	Akukho ngxaki emva koko.
I didn't think of anything.	Khange ndicinge nto.
His wife has left.	Umfazi wakhe uye wahamba.
He came out just before it happened.	Waphuma kanye ngaphambi kokuba yenzeke.
But it can all be easy.	Kodwa konke kunokuba lula.
He knows this is his job.	Uyazi ukuba lo ngumsebenzi wakhe.
Another name for now.	Elinye igama okwangoku.
He was not too far away.	Wayengekho kude kakhulu.
We definitely need to and we will do this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka kwaye siza kuyenza le nto.
I'm coming forward again.	Ndiza ngaphambili kwakhona.
And, of course, it wasn’t just about me.	Kwaye, ngokuqinisekileyo, kwakungekho ngam nje.
I'm not good at it.	Andikho kakuhle kuyo.
I want to see more.	Ndifuna ukubona okuninzi.
I may have done that.	Inokuba ndiyenzile loo nto.
Please talk to her a little bit.	Ndicela uthethe naye kancinci.
And no one is going to do it.	Kwaye akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
But, that is not the case here.	Kodwa, akunjalo apha.
He left anyway.	Wemka kunjalo.
Only, of course, what he knew.	Kuphela, ngokuqinisekileyo, oko wayesazi.
I'm not sure it will look good.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iya kubonakala ilungile.
He is not very much.	Akakho kakhulu.
I'm sure he is asleep.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba ulele.
I can read music.	Ndiyakwazi ukufunda umculo.
Not for homework.	Hayi ngomsebenzi wasekhaya.
Yes, it could, but not today.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
Later this week now.	Kamva kule veki ngoku.
He just did it very, very well.	Wenza nje kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
Here it is.	Apha kwaye.
He must succeed.	Kufuneka aphumelele.
He said nothing, and he could not say anything.	Akazange athethe nto, kwaye akazange akwazi ukuthetha nto.
Being a great reality.	Ukuba yinyani enkulu.
Image, or any of us.	Umfanekiso, okanye nabani na kuthi.
It never happened to me.	Zange yenzeke kum.
I want to do something, but I don't know what it is.	Ndifuna ukwenza into, kodwa andazi ukuba yintoni.
Yeah, now I know.	Ewe, ngoku ndiyazi.
It’s something that someone else does.	Yinto eyenziwa komnye umntu.
I don't know how he lives with you.	Andazi ukuba uhlala njani nawe.
And he spent the night.	Kwaye wachitha ubusuku.
Yes, both of them.	Ewe, bobabini.
Man lives alone, something like that.	Umntu uhlala yedwa, into enjalo.
Now, away from you.	Ngoku, kude nawe.
You want to get out of here.	Ufuna ukuphuma apha.
The police just want to know about it.	Amapolisa afuna nje ukwazi ngayo.
I don't like this about me.	Andiyithandi le nto kum.
You have to be a little man.	Kufuneka ube yindoda encinci.
He could not stop thinking about her.	Akazange akwazi ukuyeka ukucinga ngaye.
He thought about it a lot.	Wacinga ngaloo nto kakhulu.
At the time, he could not.	Ngelo xesha, akazange akwazi.
His mother could not control herself.	Umama wakhe akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
It was not worth the time.	Bekungafanelanga ixesha.
It's all the same thing.	Yinto enye yonke.
So the work has done well.	Ngoko umsebenzi wenze kakuhle.
But he also cannot do this job alone.	Kodwa naye akakwazi ukwenza lo msebenzi eyedwa.
They say they go to school with you.	Bathi baya nawe esikolweni.
I tried to get to it.	Ndazama ukuya kuyo.
Maybe he would talk.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuthetha.
So it was obvious.	Ngoko kwakubonakala.
I knew it.	Bendisazi.
Travel in one month.	Ukuhamba kwinyanga enye.
He was making a good mistake in every way.	Wayenza impazamo entle ngayo yonke indlela.
See our conversation with him.	Jonga intetho yethu kunye naye.
I just know it.	Ndiyakwazi nje.
It's a meal with friends.	Ingaba isidlo kunye nabahlobo.
I don't want to stay here.	Andifuni ukuhlala apha.
He really wants to die as soon as possible.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukufa ngokukhawuleza.
You have the same problem.	Unengxaki efanayo.
You deserve to get it.	Ufanele ukufumana.
When he is not at home.	Xa engekho ekhaya.
They always can.	Bahlala ke khona.
I think maybe this is not necessary for me.	Ndicinga ukuba mhlawumbi oku akufuneki kum.
I saw him here last night.	Ndimbone apha phezolo.
He made many mistakes.	Wenza iimpazamo ezininzi.
Where you want it.	Apho ufuna khona.
Everyone is doing their best.	Wonke umntu wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
Really getting to know someone takes time.	Ngokwenene ukwazi umntu kuthatha ixesha.
I'm so sorry for you.	Ndiyaxolisa kakhulu ngawe.
Tell anyone anything.	Xelela nabani na nantoni na.
I will make you peace.	Ndiza kukwenza uxolo.
I don't really know where the mistake is.	Andazi ngenene ukuba iphi impazamo.
Playing music is very loud.	Ukudlala umculo phezulu kakhulu.
I want to go win.	Ndifuna ukuya ukuphumelela.
Yes this is more difficult.	Ewe oku kunzima ngakumbi.
I will not do anything unless you want me to.	Andisayi kwenza nto ngaphandle kokuba ufuna ndenze njalo.
He was not going anywhere.	Wayengayi ndawo.
But you already know it all.	Kodwa sele uyazi yonke loo nto.
One day, all of this will happen.	Ngenye imini, konke oku kuya kwenzeka.
In this case, the person has to do his best.	Kule meko, umntu kufuneka enze konke okusemandleni akhe.
I'd like to talk to you about it.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
I don't have to tell you all this.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndikuxelele yonke le nto.
You make a mistake, you are human.	Wenza impazamo, ungumntu.
And he would be even more successful.	Kwaye wayeza kuphumelela ngakumbi.
Clearly, she wanted to talk to him.	Kucacile ukuba wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
He did not know what this was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni le.
To make it easier to find.	Ukwenza kube lula ukufumana.
What are you doing right here.	Wenza ntoni kanye apha.
If it is right, it is.	Ukuba ilungile, kunjalo.
He did not say anything immediately.	Akazange athethe nto ngoko nangoko.
One down, many to go.	Omnye phantsi, abaninzi ukuya.
I arrived with it last night.	Ndifike ngayo phezolo.
He will make you think.	Uya kukwenza ucinge.
He wanted to know now.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngoku.
What he wants.	Yintoni ayifunayo.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo malunga .
Everything is better now.	Konke kungcono ngoku.
I try to do it every day.	Ndizama ukuyenza yonke imihla.
As it will do anything.	Njengoko iya kwenza nantoni na.
He became one.	Waba yiyo.
But it is also impossible.	Kodwa kwakhona akunakwenzeka.
I never heard of that.	Zange ndeva ngalonto.
Maybe stay in class.	Mhlawumbi uhlale eklasini.
This time we will do it my way.	Ngeli xesha siza kuyenza ngendlela yam.
Working on it.	Ukusebenza kukho.
Right now he wanted to think.	Kanye ngoku wayefuna ukucinga.
I don't say we have to be there.	Andithi kufuneka sibe lapho.
Good job, and thank you.	Umsebenzi omhle, kwaye enkosi.
He really wanted to go and he was coming.	Wayefuna ngokwenene ukuba aye kwaye wayeza.
Besides, everyone does it.	Ngaphandle koko, wonke umntu uyayenza.
The wait will be over soon.	Ukulinda kuza kuphela kungekudala.
He got to bed.	Wafika ebhedini.
But, everything is fine.	Kodwa, yonke into ilungile.
The house he lives in.	Indlu ahlala kuyo.
But if that happened to one of us.	Kodwa ukuba oko kwenzeke komnye wethu.
And that! 	Kwaye oko!
You know your person well.	Wazi kakuhle umntu wakho.
There is no such person.	Akakho loo mntu.
I do not know how.	Andazi indlela.
You have to tell me how to do it.	Kufuneka undixelele ukuba uyenza njani.
Dinner, yes.	Isidlo sangokuhlwa, ewe.
Nobody thinks that way.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngolo hlobo.
I knew one.	Ndandisazi enye.
Slow but smooth.	Ukuhamba kancinci kodwa kakuhle.
And this is what happens.	Kwaye kwenzeka oku.
He wants money today.	Ufuna imali namhlanje.
Then another week.	Emva koko enye iveki.
But today is better.	Kodwa namhlanje kungcono.
Obviously he wants another wife.	Kucacile ukuba ufuna omnye umfazi.
No, thank you, I will never do it again.	Hayi, enkosi, soze ndiphinde.
I'm trying to stay there.	Ndizama ukuhlala apho.
He didn't know about it.	Wayengazi ngayo.
You talk to me tomorrow.	Uthetha nam kusasa.
We have made mistakes.	Senze iimpazamo.
That is my job now.	Ngumsebenzi wam lowo ngoku.
It will be as if we never had.	Kuya kuba ngathi asizange sibe njalo.
I came to talk about that.	Ndize kuthetha ngaloo nto.
He was coming to town.	Wayeza kuza edolophini.
It is very unusual to think so much.	Yinto engaqhelekanga kakhulu ukucinga kakhulu.
Maybe true, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi yinyani, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Outside there is none.	Ngaphandle akukho.
The only way.	Indlela kuphela.
Dad loves it.	Utata uyayithanda.
Getting there, is exactly what he wants.	Ukufumana apho, kanye le nto ayifunayo.
Yes, one wants money.	Ewe, umntu ufuna imali.
He is here to do his work.	Ulapha ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
Then he got out of it.	Emva koko waphuma kuyo.
No one lives that long.	Akukho mntu uhlala ixesha elide kangako.
But, it will come soon.	Kodwa, iza kufika ngokukhawuleza.
You should have stayed.	Bekufanele uhlale.
But how much time do you have ?.	Kodwa unexesha elingakanani?.
That's all, then.	Yiloo nto kuphela, ngoko.
The doctor finally.	Ugqirha ekugqibeleni.
I am not sure how successful they will be.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba baya kuphumelela kangakanani na.
And now you know.	Kwaye ngoku uyazi.
I don't want to be here without him by my side.	Andikuthandi ukuba lapha ngaphandle kwakhe ecaleni kwam.
Everyone is gone.	Wonke umntu akakho.
Someone else, maybe.	Omnye umntu, mhlawumbi.
I can't wait to work with you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukusebenza nawe.
That will be now.	Oko kuya kuba ngoku.
Thank you all .	Enkosi lonke .
One will be.	Omnye uya kuba njalo.
And he wanted to talk to her.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
Everything has to be done quickly.	Yonke into kufuneka yenziwe ngokukhawuleza.
That is the book.	Yiloo ncwadi.
Nothing up here.	Akukho nto apha phezulu.
How do you go.	Uhamba njani.
It means everything and it goes.	Kuthetha konke kwaye kuhamba.
I like this restaurant.	Ndiyayithanda le ndawo yokutyela.
Unless otherwise.	Ngaphandle kokuba ngenye indlela.
Sounds good though.	Kubonakala kulungile kodwa.
This is fine.	Ilungile le nto.
Not as you are now.	Hayi njengoko unjalo ngoku.
And he wants to stay in his house.	Kwaye ufuna ukuhlala endlwini yakhe.
I want things.	Ndifuna izinto.
Everyone has been so fun.	Wonke umntu ube mnandi kakhulu.
He told me he would be there.	Undixelele ukuba uzakuba khona.
No one deserves to be anything.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba nantoni na.
He also did not speak.	Naye akazange athethe.
And he never told anyone.	Kwaye akazange axelele mntu.
I want to know where it is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba iphi.
As he did not know why.	Njengoko wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
Will we do the same tomorrow?	Ngaba siza kwenza into efanayo ngomso?
I think maybe.	Ndicinga ukuba mhlawumbi.
Really, it’s great to have you and us.	Ngokwenene, kuhle kakhulu ukuba nawe kunye nathi.
Maybe he will and maybe not.	Mhlawumbi uya kwenza kwaye mhlawumbi akayi.
Yes and yes.	Ewe kwaye ewe.
I hope to go further.	Ndiyathemba ukuhamba ngakumbi.
The big thing is not the person.	Into enkulu hayi umntu.
Not all.	Akunjalo yonke.
John tried again.	UJohn wazama kwakhona.
And it would be sad to get out of here.	Kwaye kuya kuba buhlungu ukuphuma apha.
Tell me you work from home.	Ndixelele ukuba usebenza ekhaya.
He has to get to her.	Kufuneka afike kuye.
Tell me who I'm looking for.	Ndixelele ukuba ndijonge bani.
We go though this now.	Siya nangona oku ngoku.
I wanted a picture.	Bendifuna umfanekiso.
Finally, he continued.	Ekugqibeleni, waqhubeka.
He should, however, be.	Ufanele ukuba, nangona kunjalo, kufuneka abe njalo.
As he did not want to leave at all.	Njengoko wayengafuni tu ukuhamba.
You can make a party.	Uyakwazi ukwenza itheko.
And he also will not do it.	Kwaye naye akayi kuyenza.
And, yes, that's fine.	Kwaye, ewe, ilungile loo nto.
He was a little too much or too little.	Wayesele kancinci okanye kakhulu.
Now look away.	Ngoku jonga kude.
I don't even know what my job will be at the moment.	Andazi nokuba uzakuba yintoni umsebenzi wam okwangoku.
But, he opened it.	Kodwa, wavula.
You want to talk, to talk.	Ufuna ukuthetha, ukuthetha.
I can not read.	Andikwazi ukufunda.
So he did just that.	Ngoko wenza kanye loo nto.
Yes, that's right, but not so much.	Ewe, kunjalo, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
You will only get better.	Uya kuba ngcono kuphela.
No one has ever spoken to him like that before.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngolo hlobo naye ngaphambili.
Nice to see you .	Ndiyavuya ukubona .
It happens at work and it happens at home.	Kwenzeka emsebenzini kwaye kwenzeka ekhaya.
I would like to have lunch there.	Ndingathanda ukufumana isidlo sasemini phaya.
All over again, alone.	Konke kwakhona, ndedwa.
Everything is fine and everything is fine.	Konke kulungile kwaye yonke into ilungile.
I have to tell you something once.	Kufuneka ndikuxelele into kube kanye.
I need to talk to her about it.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngaloo nto.
Not your people.	Hayi abantu bakho.
The problem is, what do you need to do about it?	Ingxaki kukuba kufuneka wenze ntoni ngayo.
It can be a little easier.	Inokuba lula kancinci.
About everything with him.	Ngayo yonke into naye.
He just wanted to know if anyone was there.	Wayefuna nje ukwazi ukuba kukho umntu.
And you can do it now.	Kwaye ungayenza ngoku.
It’s also really hard to do.	Kwakhona kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza.
I wanted to go with him.	Bendifuna ukuhamba naye.
They are everywhere in my house.	Bakho kuyo yonke indawo endlwini yam.
You have to do something extraordinary.	Kufuneka wenze into engaqhelekanga.
And then three.	Kwaye emva koko ezintathu.
Well, you never knew.	Ewe, awuzange wazi.
She does not know how to do this.	Akazi ukuba angayenza njani le nto.
Not just some, but everyone.	Hayi nje ezinye, kodwa wonke umntu.
We want to leave immediately.	Sifuna ukuhamba ngoko nangoko.
I want to say things.	Ndifuna ukuthetha izinto.
Both, really.	Bobabini, ngokwenene.
It seemed like a good idea then.	Kwakubonakala ngathi licebo elihle ke ngoko.
You need to buy this right away.	Kufuneka uthenge oku ngokukhawuleza.
I know you completely, she told him.	Ndiyakwazi ngokupheleleyo, wamxelela.
You know you will do it.	Uyazi ukuba uya kuyenza.
In that, we all want the same thing.	Kuloo nto, sonke sifuna into enye.
Playing music on it goes well.	Ukudlala umculo kuyo kuhamba kakuhle.
And you did a great job here.	Kwaye wenze umsebenzi omkhulu apha.
He expects to do well.	Ulindele ukwenza kakuhle.
He says no one.	Uthi akukho mntu.
But maybe, not yet.	Kodwa mhlawumbi, hayi okwangoku.
That's for me.	Oko kum.
Nowhere, and everywhere.	Akukho ndawo, kwaye yonke indawo.
Almost everyone is fine.	Phantse wonke umntu ulungile.
We will definitely be back.	Siza kubuya ngokuqinisekileyo.
Really, really long time.	Ngokwenene, ixesha elide ngokwenene.
It will take a few weeks.	Kuya kuthatha iiveki ezimbalwa.
But if it's true, if it's true.	Kodwa ukuba yinyani, ukuba yinyani .
I didn't want to hurt it.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza kakubi.
He will not be.	Akayi kuba njalo.
Yes, yes they say.	Ewe, ewe bathi.
Please look here.	Ndicela ujonge apha.
You know, .	Uyazi, .
He would be the first.	Wayeza kuba nguye kuqala.
I can't really imagine what the problem might be.	Andikwazi ncam ukucinga ukuba inokuba yintoni ingxaki.
The food is good.	Ukutya kuhle.
Every day will be the same.	Yonke imihla iya kuba yinto efanayo.
It's hard, with kids.	Kunzima, nabantwana.
It is, absolutely.	Yiyo, ngokupheleleyo.
You probably know.	Mhlawumbi uyayazi.
Although it is good to have it.	Nangona kulungile ukuba nayo.
That's why everything happens.	Yiloo nto yonke into eyenzekayo.
He cannot speak for himself.	Akakwazi kuthetha ngokwakhe.
That's fine.	Nantso ilungile.
You must have felt it.	Umele ukuba waziva.
I'll bring it back tomorrow.	Ndiza kubuya nayo ngomso.
If it happens more, then something is wrong.	Ukuba kwenzeka ngakumbi, ngoko kukho into engalunganga.
You deserve someone else.	Ufanele omnye umntu.
I try to tell her her name.	Ndizama ukuba andixelele igama lakhe.
Great job along the way.	Umsebenzi omkhulu ngendlela.
Trying to find his job.	Ukuzama ukufumana umsebenzi wakhe.
Dad thought it was all right.	UTata wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
But only once.	Kodwa kunye kuphela.
I wish everyone had it.	Ndinqwenela ukuba wonke umntu abe nayo.
This time it will be better.	Ngeli xesha kuya kuba ngcono.
You know, that one.	Uyazi, lowo.
Everyone is reading this.	Wonke umntu ufunda oku.
Let me look at that again.	Makhe ndijonge oko kwakhona.
I will stay there for a few days.	Ndiza kuhlala apho iintsuku ezimbalwa.
If you want to, of course, it will be so.	Ukuba uyafuna, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba njalo.
I always do it at night.	Ndihlala ndiyenza ebusuku.
But now you know that.	Kodwa ngoku sele uyazi ukuba.
He really wanted me.	Wayefuna kakhulu kum.
I think he goes well with me.	Ndicinga ukuba uhamba kakuhle nam.
Everything is fine at home.	Yonke into ilungile ekhaya.
He may well have done so.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wakwenza oko.
He slumped down.	Wehla ngamandla phantsi.
This must be very difficult.	Oku kumele ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
He didn’t with her, though.	Akazange naye, nangona kunjalo.
They will only be here for a few days.	Baza kuba apha kuphela iintsuku ezimbalwa.
And that is a good thing for all of us.	Kwaye yinto entle leyo kuthi sonke.
Not one thing or another.	Akukho nto enye okanye enye into.
He just talked the other day.	Wathetha nje ngenye imini.
She gave her son everything.	Wanika unyana wakhe yonke into.
My children never.	Abantwana bam zange.
I have read a few, and you are right.	Ndifunde ezimbalwa, kwaye ulungile.
This would be great !.	Oku kuya kuba kuhle!.
Every day something new will happen.	Yonke imihla kuza kwenzeka into entsha.
It is not easy and it should not be.	Akukho lula kwaye akufanele kube njalo.
He gave me his help.	Wandinika uncedo lwakhe.
Now that means a few more things.	Ngoku oko kuthetha ezinye izinto ezimbalwa.
I don't know how you know about me.	Andazi ukuba wazi njani ngam.
He finally fell asleep and arrived at night.	Wagqiba walala waza wafika ebusuku.
He is going to walk alone.	Uza kuhamba yedwa.
His good sense.	Ingqondo yakhe elungileyo.
Now he knew everyone.	Ngoku wayesazi wonke umntu.
Nobody does that anyway.	Akukho mntu wenza ngolo hlobo kunjalo.
And he was able to walk.	Kwaye wakwazi ukuhamba.
Even if it seems difficult.	Nokuba kubonakala kunzima.
Not at all.	Akukho kwaphela.
If that's right.	Ukuba oko kulungile.
It was not hard to imagine.	Kwakungekho nzima ukucinga .
Then you will see the mind.	Emva koko uya kubona ingqondo.
Or for now.	Okanye okwangoku.
No one ate too much.	Akukho mntu watya kakhulu.
This is so, so far.	Oku kunjalo, kude kube ngoku.
Then sit outside.	Uze uhlale ngaphandle.
I had to do some.	Kwafuneka ndenze ezinye.
You talk about that a lot.	Uthetha ngaloo nto kakhulu.
If you will stay.	Ukuba uya kuhlala.
And you came yesterday.	Kwaye ufike izolo.
This is probably long enough.	Oku mhlawumbi ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
Work has to do the same thing.	Umsebenzi kufuneka wenze into enye.
Someone said something, whatever.	Umntu athethe into, nantoni na.
You have to speak out.	Kufuneka uthethe phandle.
Because he does it perfectly.	Kuba uyenza loo nto ngokupheleleyo.
Today he has apologized.	Namhlanje uye wacela uxolo.
It's going to be weird.	Iza kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Before his time.	Phambi kwexesha lakhe.
You and your friends.	Wena nabahlobo bakho.
Then tomorrow.	Khona ngomso .
You seem smart to me.	Ubonakala ukrelekrele kum.
Please make it easier.	Nceda ukuhamba kube lula.
Good job, you will say.	Umsebenzi omhle, uya kuthetha.
You will not have to think about it.	Akuyi kufuneka ucinge ngayo.
But in my own way.	Kodwa ngendlela yam.
Less money.	Imali encinci.
It seemed to take too long.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
You just have to be able to do it.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukwenza.
She would like this.	Angathanda oku.
He knew in three days it.	Wayesazi iintsuku ezintathu kuyo.
I do not know what this is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni le.
Everyone speaks well.	Wonke umntu uthetha kakuhle.
Maybe that ??? 	Mhlawumbi loo nto???
No one wanted to go out.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuphuma phandle.
He thinks it is good.	Ucinga ukuba kuhle.
Many did not.	Abaninzi abazange.
Now, not later.	Ngoku, hayi kamva.
Needless to say, that did not happen.	Akuyomfuneko ukuthetha ukuba oko akuzange kwenzeke.
I hope we will continue.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kuqhubeka.
I just think he wanted me to see him.	Ndicinga nje ukuba wayefuna ndimbone.
He wanted to leave, but.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kodwa .
Something that never really happened.	Into engazange yenzeke ngokwenene.
But you were never there.	Kodwa awuzange ube lapho.
So maybe you should have talked to him.	Ngoko mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba uthetha naye.
Easy exit.	Ukuphuma lula.
We both go to it.	Sobabini siya kuyo.
Until tonight, that's right.	Kude kube ngokuhlwanje, kunjalo.
Now you have it.	Ngoku unayo.
Tell someone you love them.	Xelela umntu ukuba uyamthanda.
I don't know what that means.	Andazi ukuba oko kuthetha ntoni na.
You know we will get another dog sooner or later.	Uyazi ukuba siza kufumana enye inja kungekudala okanye kamva.
But it will happen in the end.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
But not all.	Kodwa hayi phantse yonke.
But today at school you said something.	Kodwa namhlanje esikolweni uthethe into.
I want to know, too.	Ndifuna ukwazi, nam.
Maybe in a week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki.
He did not want me to be sad.	Wayengafuni ndibe buhlungu.
And in this case it is not yet.	Kwaye kule meko akukho okwangoku.
Now or.	Ngoku okanye.
For me, everything is going well.	Kum, konke kuhamba kakuhle.
He went down a lot.	Wehla kakhulu.
They had to go there.	Kwafuneka baye apho.
Then, just wait for it to settle down.	Emva koko, ulinde nje ukuhlala.
Not here, in this place.	Hayi apha, kule ndawo.
Look at our picture.	Jonga umfanekiso wethu.
There is only one thing.	Kukho into kuphela.
Just a few questions about that.	Imibuzo nje embalwa ngaloo nto.
He looks like he has something to say.	Ukhangeleka ngathi kukho into afuna ukuyithetha.
well, that's it.	kuhle, yiloo nto.
And you should know.	Kwaye kufuneka ukwazi.
He has to do a better job in that situation.	Kufuneka enze umsebenzi ongcono kuloo meko.
Therefore, it will not happen.	Ngoko ke, akuyi kwenzeka.
My mother is here.	Umama ulapha.
No one was going to say or do anything.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuthetha okanye enze nantoni na.
I really want to get that.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukufumana oko.
Everything the same now.	Yonke into enye ngoku.
I told him a lot before he left.	Ndamxelela kakhulu phambi kokuba ahambe.
There is nothing here, nothing.	Akukho nto apha, akukho nto.
One for you.	Enye kuwe.
Someone doesn't like it.	Omnye akayithandi.
There was no food there.	Kwakungekho kutya apho.
No problem.	Akukho nto ingxaki.
Yes, my son, too.	Ewe, unyana wam, naye.

He does that.	Uyenza loo nto.
A car is a toy, too.	Imoto yinto yokudlala, nayo.
I think he had to do that.	Ndicinga ukuba kwafuneka enjenjalo.
Working with friends.	Ukusebenza nabahlobo.
There is just again.	Kukho kwakhona nje.
This is already the case.	Oku sele kunjalo.
As you talk about.	Njengoko uthetha ngayo.

Help someone else.	Nceda omnye umntu.
There is always a better way.	Kuhlala kukho indlela engcono.
That will definitely make the job easier.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi ube lula.

I badly want a good job.	Ndifuna kakubi umsebenzi omhle.
He did not say anything, but he did anything.	Akazange athethe nantoni na, kodwa enze nantoni na.
Not at all here.	Akunjalo konke konke apha.
Three clearly did not.	Abathathu ngokucacileyo abazange.
A little more than that.	Kancinci ngaphezu koko.

He would be a good man.	Wayeza kuba ngumntu olungileyo.
Being away for a long time.	Ukuba kude ixesha elide.

However, this will require less space.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kuya kufuna indawo encinci.
I will do everything as it should.	Ndiya kwenza yonke into njengoko kufuneka.

We made good money there.	Senze imali entle phaya.
But in the end, they will.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, baya kwenza.
And how difficult it would be.	Kwaye bekuya kuba nzima kangakanani.
My wife loves it.	Umfazi wam uyayithanda.
It’s hard to know anything for sure.	Kunzima ukwazi nantoni na ngokuqinisekileyo.
I feel that way every morning.	Ndiziva njalo kusasa.
Help me .	Ndincede .
Maybe you did really well at it.	Mhlawumbi wenze kakuhle ngenene kuyo.
I want to be in one place.	Ndifuna ukuba kwindawo enye.

He talks more.	Uthetha ngakumbi.
No, that's a big deal.	Hayi, yinto enkulu kakhulu.
But you can't get one.	Kodwa awukwazi ukufumana enye.

Where is the girl.	Iphi intombi .
How and why, we'll see later.	Njani kwaye kutheni, siza kubona kamva.
I'm not sure about that, yet.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto, okwangoku.
Really, really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene, kunjalo.
Well done, and thank you.	Wenze kakuhle, kwaye enkosi.
Have you ever thought.	Ngaba ukhe wacinga .
I'm not sure we will.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba siya kufuna.
You will get your car.	Uza kufumana imoto yakho.
If you expect to succeed, you will surely succeed.	Ukuba ulindele ukuphumelela, ngokuqinisekileyo, uya kuphumelela.
He spends most of his time there.	Uchitha ixesha lakhe elininzi apho.
But he will be back soon.	Kodwa uza kubuya kungekudala.
He has done all this.	Uyenzile yonke le nto.
So he told the police.	Ngoko waxelela amapolisa.
Unless all of that.	Ngaphandle kokuba yonke loo nto.
Everyone did not want to say anything to him.	Wonke umntu wayengafuni ukuthetha nantoni na kuye.
He slept a little.	Ulele kancinci.
This will be clearly seen.	Oku kuya kubonakala ngokucacileyo.
I don't understand why you do this.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni uyenza le nto.
What money.	Yintoni imali.
He told me right away.	Undixelele kwangoko.
Not the front, not the back.	Hayi ngaphambili, hayi emva.
And to do what.	Kwaye ukwenza ntoni.
But you are reading this.	Kodwa ufunda oku.
This is something completely new to me.	Le yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo kum.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akazange enjenjalo.
It's okay for him to do it.	Kulungile ukuba ayenze.
I have to talk to him myself.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngokwam.
Finding a room is not.	Ukufumana igumbi akunjalo.
No one is doing the right thing again.	Akukho mntu wenza into elungileyo kwakhona.
It is good to be alone.	Kuhle ukuba wedwa.
There is no way one wants to go.	Akukho ndlela umntu afuna ukuhamba ngayo.
One day maybe but not now.	Ngenye imini mhlawumbi kodwa hayi ngoku.
Something.	Into ethile.
I couldn't help but look.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ndijonge.
Just a few days away.	Iintsuku nje ezimbalwa kude.
Because that's exactly what it is.	Kuba yiloo nto kanye.
Or if something else happens to you.	Okanye ukuba kukho enye into eyenzekayo kuwe.
And he told me that everyone knows.	Kwaye wandixelela ukuba wonke umntu uyazi.
He did not want to go there at all.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho kwaphela.
Even if you are good at anything.	Nokuba ulungile nantoni na.
And in this way.	Kwaye ngolu hlobo.
Which is probably what he did.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi wayenza.
I can't go home.	Andikwazi ukuya ekhaya.
Going again and again.	Ukuhamba kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
That is a big mistake.	Impazamo enkulu enkulu leyo.
He too did not want to do anything.	Naye wayengafuni kwenza nto.
It will go well.	Iza kuhamba kakuhle.
And so he felt.	Kwaye ngoko waziva.
I had to bring him.	Kwafuneka ndize naye.
Two days, maybe three.	Iintsuku ezimbini, mhlawumbi ezintathu.
Just as you should.	Kanye njengokuba ufanele ukwenza.
The children sit in the back.	Abantwana bahlala ngasemva.
I hope they find friends.	Ndiyathemba ukuba baya kufumana abahlobo.
I have no money for it.	Andikho kuyo imali.
He thought that anything could happen to him.	Wacinga ukuba kunokwenzeka nantoni na kuye.
She is not at home or in the office.	Akakho ekhaya okanye eofisini.
But all is well though.	Kodwa konke kuhle kakhulu nangona kunjalo.
He wants to be old.	Ufuna ukuba mdala.
By all means.	Ngayo yonke indlela.
I think you like that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda loo nto.
So they stayed here all day.	Ngoko bahlala apha imini yonke.
I will keep trying.	Ndiza kuqhubeka ndizama.
No success, no money.	Akukho kuphumelela, akukho mali.
Why does he have to stay so long? 	Kutheni kufuneka ahlale ixesha elide kangaka?
Going through everything.	Ukuhamba kuyo yonke into.
No one can be.	Akukho mntu unokuba .
He almost left the house.	Uphantse waphuma endlwini.
That might be the one, he realized.	Inokuba nguye lowo, waqonda.
Then he tried.	Emva koko wazama.
However, he did not succeed.	Nangona kunjalo akazange aphumelele.
It’s a person, himself.	Ngumntu, ngokwakhe.
He did not really tell the truth.	Khange athethe nyani.
I don't know anyone there.	Andazi mntu apho.
He just lives here.	Uhlala nje apha.
But there he made a mistake.	Kodwa apho wenze impazamo.
So at that time it was not so easy.	Ngoko ngelo xesha kwakungekho lula kangako.
I think about this all the time.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngale nto ngalo lonke ixesha.
It should be easy to do, but it is not.	Kufuneka kube lula ukwenza, kodwa akunjalo.
Not in class for a few years.	Akukho eklasini iminyaka embalwa.
That's the big thing about him.	Nantso ke into enkulu ngaye.
I can't do without him.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe.
And it takes money.	Kwaye kuthatha imali.
He must learn to help others first.	Kufuneka afunde ukunceda abanye kuqala.
See what it is now.	Jonga ukuba yintoni ngoku.
But he did not have to do anything about it.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze nto ngaloo nto.
You will need money.	Uya kufuna imali.
He knows he has to be much better.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka abe ngcono kakhulu.
He is very eager to learn.	Uzimisele kakhulu ukufunda.
He asked what it was.	Wabuza ukuba yintoni na.
I know you completely.	Ndikwazi ngokupheleleyo.
Although difficult, it is impossible.	Nangona kunzima, akunakwenzeka.
Well, that's up to now.	Ewe, oko kude kube ngoku.
He is the one who has to make the decision.	Nguye ekufuneka enze isigqibo.
No one has ever lived so long.	Akukho mntu wakha wahlala ixesha elide kangako.
It's all done.	Yenziwe yonke.
Every mother is like that.	Wonke umama unjalo.
Maybe someone there will know.	Mhlawumbi umntu apho uya kukwazi.
If he only knew.	Ukuba wayesazi.
You did not speak to us.	Awuzange uthethe nathi.
I thought it might be you.	Bendicinga ukuba inokuba nguwe.
Just seeing what he wants.	Ukubona nje into ayifunayo.
Probably without one.	Mhlawumbi ngaphandle komnye.
Now you have looked up.	Ngoku uye wajonga phezulu.
You probably never thought of it.	Mhlawumbi khange ucinge ngayo.
That would be great.	Oko kube kuhle.
He has been in school for years.	Uhambe iminyaka esikolweni.
She does not want to have many children.	Akafuni kuba nabantwana abaninzi.
I know about you now.	Ndiyazi ngawe ngoku.
I do not remember last night.	Andikhumbuli phezolo.
If and if and if.	Ukuba kwaye ukuba kwaye ukuba.
You will see why soon.	Uya kubona ukuba kutheni kungekudala.
It hasn't been very difficult, though.	Akuzange kube nzima kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I would be a little weird.	Ndiya kuba yinto engaqhelekanga.
Everything old.	Yonke into endala.
One has to know why.	Umntu kufuneka azi ukuba kutheni.
You have a car.	Unayo imoto.
Nobody has to do that.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze loo nto.
Anyone can do that at any time.	Nabani na angayenza loo nto nanini na.
After all, we didn't do that either.	Emva koko, nathi asizange senze njalo.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi .
So that's three weeks.	Ngoko iiveki ezintathu oko.
He will be one day.	Uya kuba njalo ngenye imini.
Just trying to get there.	Ukuzama nje ukuya khona.
He did not appear on his own, though.	Akazange abonakale ngokwakhe, nangona kunjalo.
You obviously want to help.	Ngokucacileyo ufuna ukunceda.
Here he would only succeed very well.	Apha wayeza kuphumelela kuphela kakuhle kakhulu.
I think it will be very difficult to say.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima kakhulu ukuyithetha.
If possible, please.	Xa kunokwenzeka, nceda.
I thought it was possible at the time.	Ndandicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka ngelo xesha.
You probably know exactly what it is.	Usenokuba uyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
But it's good for me.	Kodwa kuhle kum.
No one expects anything.	Akukho mntu ulindele nantoni na.
Or is that what it is.	Okanye yiloo nto ke le.
Thank you very much!!!.	Enkosi kakhulu!!!.
I think that’s okay if it’s okay.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile ukuba kulungile.
So, maybe not.	Ngoko, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I would like your test on him.	Ndingathanda uvavanyo lwakho ngaye.
To and from.	Ukuya, kwaye kude.
I need to know now.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngoku.
Now there is plenty of food.	Ngoku kukho ukutya okuninzi.
I do not know where you live.	Andikwazi apho uhlala khona.
He wanted to see.	Wayefuna ukubona .
And too much food.	Kwaye ukutya okuninzi kakhulu.
I love it, really.	Ndiyayithanda, ngokwenene.
He had to talk to her for a long time.	Kwafuneka athethe naye ixesha elide.
I look at his wife.	Ndijonge umfazi wakhe.
I hope it will succeed.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iya kuphumelela.
Play is very good.	Ukudlala kuhle kakhulu.
That would have been easy for him.	Oko bekuya kuba lula kuye.
He sat down with her.	Wahlala phantsi naye.
I can't find anything to work with.	Andikwazi ukufumana nantoni na ukusebenza.
But it may seem that way.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba kubonakala nje ngolo hlobo.
No, very quickly.	Hayi, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
What else? 	Yintoni enye?
I did not want you to do that.	Bendingafuni ukuba wenze njalo.
She looks great in him and loves him.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu kuye kwaye uyayithanda.
There must be something else.	Kumele ukuba kukho enye into.
This will do well.	Oku kuya kwenza kakuhle.
He had to do it again.	Kwafuneka ayenze kwakhona.
He is often the first to die.	Udla ngokuba ngowokuqala ukufa.
Quitting the old one, it makes a new way.	Ukuyeka endala, kwenza indlela entsha.
He does the work with it.	Wenza umsebenzi ngayo.
Lots of deaths, of course.	Ukufa okuninzi, kunjalo.
I mean nice thing.	Ndithetha into entle.
She's right in the end.	Ilungile ekugqibeleni.
I really need help.	Ndifuna ngokwenene uncedo.
I only want one thing.	Ndifuna into enye kuphela.
So some say.	Ngoko abanye bathi.
We will not have long.	Asiyi kuba nexesha elide.
But still, that place.	Kodwa kunjalo, loo ndawo.
Then one day.	Emva koko ngenye imini.
But maybe you went a little further for him.	Kodwa mhlawumbi uhambe kancinci kuye.
And we have to be somewhere.	Kwaye kufuneka sibe kwindawo ethile.
They would talk fast enough, he thought.	Baza kuthetha ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo, wacinga.
And why should he do so.	Kwaye kutheni kufuneka enjenjalo.
He will or will not come.	Uya kuza okanye akayi kuza.
Let me tell you one thing.	Makhe ndikuxelele into enye.
It is not easy to succeed.	Akukho lula ukuphumelela.
You do not know what you are talking about.	Awuyazi ukuba uthetha ngantoni.
He is asleep, but he is fully aware of it.	Ulele, kodwa uyazi ngokupheleleyo.
He will be there tomorrow.	Uzakuba khona ngomso.
Here, they did not.	Apha, abazange.
I'm sure you told someone.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba umxelele umntu.
But everyone knows about him.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyazi ngaye.
Making a decision becomes difficult or impossible.	Ukwenza isigqibo kuba nzima okanye akunakwenzeka.
It's all done.	Yonke yenziwe.
I would like to get his approval.	Ndingathanda ukufumana imvume yakhe.
However, in this case.	Nangona kunjalo, kule meko.
And they didn't, together.	Kwaye abazange, kunye.
There is help.	Kukho uncedo.
It looks like you do, too.	Kubonakala ngathi unjalo, nawe.
I had to get there.	Kwafuneka ndifike apho.
But it can be painful.	Kodwa inokuba buhlungu.
Probably never happened to him before.	Mhlawumbi akuzange kwenzeke kuye ngaphambili.
This he kept doing.	Oku waqhubeka wakwenza.
He looked, he saw.	Wajonga, wabona.
My mother lives here.	Umama uhlala apha.
He wants something from us.	Ufuna enye into kuthi.
You knew it was going to happen.	Ubusazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Everyone loves something like that.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda into enjalo.
Thinking through action.	Ukucinga ngokwenza.
No one ever spoke.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha.
Making it harder to walk.	Ukwenza kube nzima ukuhamba.
And then, again.	Kwaye emva koko, kwakhona.
He tried to imagine what it would do for him.	Wazama ukucinga ukuba kuya kwenza ntoni kuye.
If you play well, you stay.	Ukuba udlala kakuhle, uhlala.
Then he asked her name.	Emva koko wabuza igama lakhe.
Or he never stopped.	Okanye akazange ayeke.
That's the way you did it.	Nantso indlela owenze ngayo.
Eventually he had to say something.	Ekugqibeleni kwafuneka athethe into.
There is nothing inside him, no one.	Ngaphakathi kwakhe akukho nto, akukho mntu.
As he does.	Njengoko esenza.
Is that true? 	Ngaba yinyani leyo?
But you must be afraid.	Kodwa umele ukuba uyoyika.
The question remains the same.	Umbuzo uhlala ufana.
This is just hard.	Oku kunzima nje.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akunjalo.
I will go to the end all the time.	Ndiza kuya ekugqibeleni ngalo lonke ixesha.
That seems better to me.	Oko kubonakala kungcono kum.
And the coffee here is very good.	Kwaye ikofu apha ilungile kakhulu.
He does a great job here.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu apha.
Obviously no one feels like buying today.	Ngokucacileyo akukho mntu uziva efuna ukuthenga namhlanje.
For if he is not.	Kuba ukuba akakho .
And if not, you need someone.	Kwaye ukuba akunjalo, kufuneka umntu.
He too has lived here all his life.	Naye wahlala apha ubomi bakhe bonke.
One of us will.	Omnye wethu uya kukwenza.
Here not too much.	Apha hayi kakhulu.
There is always a question.	Kuhlala kukho umbuzo.
Not all, of course, but some.	Hayi bonke, kunjalo, kodwa abanye.
And he has certainly done it.	Kwaye uyenzile ngokuqinisekileyo.
But later you will want to talk to him.	Kodwa kamva uya kufuna ukuthetha naye.
It ended that way.	Kwaphela kunjalo.
Even now it is not.	Nangoku akunjalo.
And then he stays.	Kwaye ke uhlala.
I look forward to it all week.	Ndijonge phambili kuyo yonke iveki.
Such a beautiful girl.	Intombi entle kangaka.
A little something, really.	Into encinci, ngokwenene.
I'm glad you're here too.	Ndiyavuya ulapha nawe.
That comes with time.	Oko kuza kunye nexesha.
You will be up and down.	Uya kuba phezulu phantsi.
He thought of everyone but himself.	Wayecinga ngaye wonke umntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
There was nothing, and it was obvious.	Kwakungekho nto, kwaye kwakubonakala.
he stayed with you.	wahlala nawe.
He just wanted to finish.	Wayefuna ukugqiba kuphela.
And soon again.	Kwaye ngokukhawuleza kwakhona.
Maybe some weeks.	Mhlawumbi ezinye iiveki.
But, nonetheless, he did very well.	Kodwa, nangona kunjalo, wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
One looking down, the other looking sideways.	Omnye ujonge phantsi, omnye ujonge ecaleni.
I will continue to do that.	Ndiza kuqhubeka ndiyenza loo nto.
This never happened to me.	Ayizange yenzeke lento kum.
I wanted to say things about it.	Bendifuna ukuthetha izinto ngayo.
I didn't see him after that.	Khange ndimbone emva koko.
But it was not so long ago.	Kodwa zange kube kudala kangaka.
Yes, almost everywhere.	Ewe, phantse kuyo yonke indawo.
Come with me.	Ukuza nam.
My parents more.	Abazali bam ngakumbi.
It should not be for me.	Bekungafanelanga kum.
As we shall see, he was not far off.	Njengoko siza kubona, wayengekho kude.
She reads down.	Ufunda phantsi.
But he only looked down.	Kodwa wajonga phantsi kuphela.
He would tell her that later.	Wayeza kumxelela oko kamva.
All of this he seems to have done.	Konke oku kubonakala ukuba uyenzile.
It's a thing to do, one thing.	Yinto yokwenza, into enye.
He just can't take a chance.	Akakwazi nje ukuthatha ithuba.
Sorry, I'm not sure.	Uxolo, andiqinisekanga.
You should get to work early.	Kumele ukuba ufike kwangoko emsebenzini.
That is not the case, though.	Oko akunjalo, nangona kunjalo.
That will eventually go away.	Oko kuya kuhamba ekugqibeleni.
But you look confident, now.	Kodwa ubonakala uqinisekile, ngoku.
I live there today.	Ndihlala khona namhlanje.
And there are my children.	Kwaye kukho abantwana bam.
If so how ?.	Ukuba ewe njani?.
He saw a woman, almost.	Wabona umfazi, phantse.
Then it all happened there.	Emva koko konke kwenzeka apho.
Thus reading.	Ngaloo ndlela ukufunda.
My job got away from that.	Umsebenzi wam wemka kuloo nto.
A very unusual problem.	Ingxaki engaqhelekanga kakhulu.
I made it impossible.	Ndenze ukuba akunakwenzeka.
And it seems we did.	Kwaye kubonakala ngathi senze njalo.
If so, not at all.	Ukuba kunjalo, akunjalo kwaphela.
I must have done that.	Kumele ukuba ndiyenzile loo nto.
He too lived there.	Naye wayehlala apho.
He came to sit next to me.	Waza kuhlala ecaleni kwam.
I am here to do my job.	Ndilapha ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
I'm really here.	Ndilapha ngokwenene.
He is interested in everything.	Unomdla kuyo yonke into.
And it will happen.	Kwaye kuya kwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
I didn't really know him.	Khange ndikwazi ncam kuye.
There he sat before him, after that.	Apho wahlala phambi kwakhe, emva koko.
I know exactly why.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
He started at the top.	Waqalisa phezulu.
I think he knows why he didn't stay.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba kutheni engazange ahlale.
So surely he would come.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuza.
By this time you may have gone too far, though.	Ngeli xesha usenokuba uye kakhulu, nangona.
All this, you know.	Konke oku, uyazi.
He must have been doing that for a long time.	Umele ukuba kudala ekwenza oko.
Yes he told me.	Ewe wandixelela .
He wanted her to know the truth.	Wayefuna ukuba azi inyaniso.
I won't have any problems.	Andiyi kuba nayiphi na ingxaki.
Look at the book.	Jonga incwadi.
It had to be done.	Kwafuneka ukuba yenziwe.
Almost always people.	Phantse njalo abantu.
He knows what he wants to do.	Uyayazi into afuna ukuyenza.
He tried to think of anything, everything.	Wazama ukucinga ngayo nantoni na, yonke into.
I do not know you.	Andikwazi wena.
He will surely return.	Uya kubuya ngokuqinisekileyo.
I will be inside.	Ndiza kuba ngaphakathi.
Not that he wanted to.	Akunjalo ukuba wayefuna.
And people.	Kwaye abantu .
I too was now looking for a job.	Nam ngoku ndandifuna umsebenzi.
That would be so difficult.	Oko bekuya kuba nzima kangako.
Look in your office.	Jonga eofisini yakho.
If not, tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngomso.
I know you are here at home with us.	Ndiyazi ukuba ulapha ekhaya kunye nathi.
I'm afraid you did.	Ndiyoyika ukuba wenze njalo.
He doesn't want you to know.	Akafuni ukuba wazi.
I'll take it if you don't want to do that.	Ndiza kuthatha ukuba awufuni ukwenza njalo.
Then he sat down again.	Emva koko wayehlala phantsi kwakhona.
Or to someone else.	Okanye komnye umntu.
Or maybe not at all.	Okanye mhlawumbi akukho konke konke.
I would probably buy it again.	Ndingathanda mhlawumbi ukuthenga kwakhona.
I could just do that.	Ndingayenza nje loo nto.
Sure, it happened.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kwenzeka.
You probably did not know.	Umele ukuba ubungazi.
He obviously needed help.	Ngokucacileyo wayefuna uncedo.
It has to be okay.	Kufuneka kulungile.
I knew one thing.	Ndandisazi into enye.
In the end, the story is just work.	Ekugqibeleni, ibali ngumsebenzi nje.
And one more thing.	Kwaye enye into ngokupheleleyo.
He said well, okay.	Wathi kuhle, kulungile.
See with us.	Jonga kunye nathi.
I don't know how to do this.	Andazi ndingayenza njani lento.
You want to know what it is.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
He is not your person either.	Akangomntu wakho naye.
Look at your phone.	Jonga ifowuni yakho.
At dinner.	Kwisidlo sangokuhlwa.
But in the end, he could not.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, akazange akwazi.
He lives with us now.	Uhlala nathi ngoku.
So we'll see what happens now.	Ngoko siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
I know you will say no.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuthi hayi.
Nothing at all.	Akukho nto kwaphela.
One does very well.	Omnye wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I didn't want to say anything.	Bendingafuni kuthetha nto.
I never thought where he was.	Khange ndicinge ukuba uphi.
He loves her enough.	Uyamthanda ngokwaneleyo.
If something goes wrong, it probably is.	Ukuba kukho into engalunganga, mhlawumbi kunjalo.
Although that takes a long time.	Nangona oko kuthatha ixesha elide.
This is a little difficult though.	Oku kunzima kancinci nangona.
He was not there when he got home.	Wayengekho xa efika ekhaya.
But then it would be.	Kodwa ke bekuya kuba njalo.
They will get some, one way or another.	Baya kufumana ezinye, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
But if you did, you certainly didn't talk about it.	Kodwa ukuba uyenzile, ngokuqinisekileyo awuzange uthethe ngayo.
Also, do not do this.	Kwakhona, musa ukuyenza le nto.
So don't dwell on that.	Ngoko musa ukuhlala ucinga ngaloo nto.
And I mean that's in a good way.	Kwaye ndithetha ukuba ngendlela elungileyo.
You should have waited.	Bekufanele ulinde.
I do all or nothing.	Ndenza konke okanye akukho nto.
Okay, but it could be better.	Kulungile, kodwa kunokuba ngcono.
He has been sitting for a long time.	Uhleli ixesha elide .
Getting there was not easy.	Kwakungekho lula ukufika apho.
Unless he is.	Ngaphandle kokuba akanjalo.
It is.	Yinto .
Someone later told me that it was.	Omnye umntu kamva wandixelela ukuba kunjalo.
Otherwise, you will surely be angry.	Ngaphandle koko, ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba nomsindo.
Maybe it was nothing, he thought.	Mhlawumbi kwakungekho nto, wacinga.
We'll just be here.	Siza kuba lapha nje.
It should not be this way.	Akufanele kube ngolu hlobo.
I'm here again.	Ndilapha kwakhona.
You may have gone either way.	Inokuba uhambe nokuba yeyiphi na indlela.
It's just nice up there.	Kuhle nje phaya phezulu.
Not my call.	Hayi umnxeba wam.
At first there is nothing.	Ekuqaleni akukho nto.
The latter told him everything that happened.	Lo mva wamxelela yonke into eyenzekayo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze oku.
Nothing has been done about it, though.	Akukho nto yenziwe ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
She is really trying to stay in her place.	Uzama ngokwenene ukuhlala kwindawo yakhe.
to play.	ukudlala.
He will do whatever he wants, whenever he wants.	Uya kwenza nantoni na ayifunayo, nanini na xa efuna.
Very nice place, too.	Indawo entle kakhulu, nayo.
But maybe not more.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ngakumbi.
Too much to do.	Ukwenza kakhulu.
One has to do something about this.	Umntu kufuneka enze into ngale nto.
His wife is there.	Umfazi wakhe ukhona.
It will be soon.	Kuya kuba kungekudala.
But others stayed.	Kodwa abanye bahlala.
I will come later.	Ndiza kuza kamva.
Well, maybe that comes later.	Hayi ke, mhlawumbi oko kuza emva kwexesha.
She is happy to be alone.	Uyavuya ukuba yedwa.
I did not go to work.	Khange ndiye emsebenzini.
I would like dinner.	Ndifuna isidlo sangokuhlwa.
Slow movement.	Ukuhamba kancinci.
This is good and good.	Oku kuhle kwaye kulungile.
I'll have to tell you everything about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndikuxelele yonke into ngayo.
I had to go again.	Kwafuneka ndiphinde ndihambe.
No one should know where you are going.	Akukho mntu ufanele azi apho uya khona.
So here you go, again.	Ngoko ke apha uya, kwakhona.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi kunjalo.
Only time.	Ixesha kuphela.
Now look inside you and tell me.	Ngoku jonga ngaphakathi kuwe kwaye undixelele.
You do not look right.	Awubonakali ulungile.
Everything, not a small thing and nothing else.	Yonke into, hayi into encinci hayi enye into.
He left that way.	Wemka ngolo hlobo.
No one deserves to be alone like that.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuhlala yedwa ngolo hlobo.
Then Dad made a big mistake.	Emva koko utata wenza impazamo yakhe enkulu.
He seldom does it when he is not there.	Akafane enze xa engekho.
Not his life.	Hayi ubomi bakhe.
This seems much better.	Oku kubonakala kungcono kakhulu.
This is my first time doing this work.	Ndiyaqala ukwenza lo msebenzi.
I sat next to him on the bed.	Ndihlale ecaleni kwakhe ebhedini.
You have to be in place to succeed.	Kufuneka ube kwindawo ukuze uphumelele.
John knows for sure.	UYohane uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
And you want to know what it is.	Kwaye ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
You have to do well.	Ufanele ukwenza kakuhle.
I doubt very much that it will be so.	Ndiyathandabuza kakhulu ukuba iya kuba njalo.
I am alone again.	Ndiphinde ndedwa.
I know about you.	Ndiyazi ngawe.
I would love to work with him.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza kunye naye.
I'm scared of something.	Ndiyoyika into.
You have been there with him.	Ukhe waba lapho naye.
I wanted to read something like this today.	Bendifuna ukufunda into enje namhlanje.
My mind, you know.	Ingqondo yam, uyazi.
I had to think about it.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngayo.
You mean something to me.	Uthetha into kum.
So, you told me.	Ke, undixelele.
Making a lot of money with money.	Ukwenza imali eninzi ngemali.
Person or persons.	Umntu okanye abantu.
And my parents, obviously.	Kwaye abazali bam, ngokucacileyo.
How would he stay.	Wayeza kuhlala njani.
While this is possible, it is highly unlikely.	Nangona oku kunokwenzeka, akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
He made every statement.	Wayenza yonke intetho.
He is not, however, as you are.	Akakho, nangona kunjalo, njengoko unjalo.
But it can be anyone.	Kodwa inokuba nabani na.
I mean in a good way.	Ndithetha ukuba ngendlela elungileyo.
I myself would rather die.	Mna ngokwam ndingathanda ukufa.
But that probably means there is a problem ahead.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuthetha ukuba kukho ingxaki ngaphambili.
But inside, for now, there is none.	Kodwa ngaphakathi, okwangoku, akukho.
If so why not.	Ukuba kunjalo kutheni kunjalo.
Not just waiting.	Hayi nje ukulinda.
Many go to class.	Abaninzi baya eklasini.
This we will not do.	Le asiyi kuyenza .
I don't know where it is.	Andazi ukuba iphi na.
I want to do it outside, if possible.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngaphandle, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I have to do something tonight.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngokuhlwanje.
And he seems interested in me.	Kwaye ubonakala unomdla kum.
He never told me about him.	Zange andixelele ngaye.
I would like to read.	Ndingathanda ukufunda.
He comes here at night.	Uza apha ebusuku.
Thinking requires work.	Ukucinga kufuna umsebenzi.
I did this alone.	Ndenze oku ndedwa.
He just walked away talking.	Wahamba nje ethetha.
I want children with you.	Ndifuna abantwana nawe.
He read books.	Wafunda iincwadi.
Maybe you want to learn something new.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukufunda into entsha.
He learned from her.	Wafunda kuye.
I’m not sure how hard it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kunzima kangakanani.
But you can't make any sense.	Kodwa awukwazi ukwenza nayiphi na ingqondo.
I mean no one thought anything of him.	Ndithetha ukuba akukho mntu wayecinga nto ngaye.
I think we should.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka senze njalo.
It will end.	Iya kuphela.
You always talk.	Usoloko uthetha.
But this will not hurt.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuba buhlungu.
It will happen, but not yet.	Kuya kwenzeka, kodwa hayi okwangoku.
If you are willing to do it.	Ukuba uzimisele ukuyenza.
He did not say as much as he did before.	Akazange athethe kakhulu njengakuqala.
Give me this.	Ndinike oku.
I have never talked to you about it before.	Andizange ndithethe nawe ngayo ngaphambili.
I should never have done it again.	Bekungafanelanga ndiyenze kwakhona.
He told me that's it.	Wandixelela ukuba yiloo nto.
And he thought.	Uye wacinga.
Please, nothing.	Nceda, akukho nto.
But we will not do that to you.	Kodwa asiyi kuyenza loo nto kuwe.
But if he did not.	Kodwa ukuba akazange .
We did everything together.	Senze yonke into kunye.
I just want to try harder.	Ndifuna nje ukuzama ngakumbi.
And now help me.	Kwaye ngoku ndincede.
But he does.	Kodwa ke uyayenza.
It will be easy enough to do.	Kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
You just think about getting better.	Ucinga nje ngokuba ngcono.
I thought it was better this way.	Ndandicinga ukuba kungcono ngolu hlobo.
And it will come.	Kwaye iya kuza.
I can get enough.	Ndiyakwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo.
I never talked to him about that.	Khange ndithethe naye oko.
But that is still not the case.	Kodwa nangoku akunjalo.
He wanted everything to be alright.	Wayefuna ukuba yonke into ilungile.
Nothing more than him.	Akukho nto ngaphezu kwakhe.
Better, he thought.	Kungcono, wacinga.
Then do all your work.	Uze wenze wonke umsebenzi wakho.
He looks down at the gun.	Ujonge phantsi umpu.
I think it's a new thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entsha.
He took the place.	Wathatha indawo.
If you like it, tell your friends.	Ukuba uyayithanda, xelela abahlobo bakho.
They will do the same thing here.	Baza kwenza into enye apha.
He also has to find another.	Naye kufuneka afune enye.
Over time it gets better.	Emva kwexesha ngcono.
I really think you should.	Ngokwenene ndicinga ukuba ufanele.
It’s even harder though.	Kunzima ngakumbi nangona kunjalo.
I know what it is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
You know a little about it, but not all of it.	Uyazi kancinci ngayo, kodwa hayi yonke.
So, you know, this is going to be tough.	Ke, uyazi, oku kuya kuba nzima.
That's exactly right.	Oko kunjalo ngokwenene.
And he is old.	Kwaye mdala.
And he wanted me to be with him everywhere.	Kwaye wayefuna ukuba ndibe naye yonke indawo.
I want something big.	Ndifuna into enkulu.
Yeah, it's a whole new thing, you know.	Ewe, yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo, uyazi.
The house up there.	Indlu phaya phezulu.
He rarely comes to town.	Akafane eze edolophini.
He continues to study '.	Uqhuba ukufunda'.
She did not want to have children.	Wayengafuni ukuba nabantwana.
But he does not have time.	Kodwa akanalo ixesha.
Or more time.	Okanye ixesha elininzi.
And go.	Kwaye uhambe .
I'm thinking of doing it.	Ndicinga ukwenza.
I do not know where they live.	Andazi apho bahlala khona.
Someone will talk a lot.	Umntu uza kuthetha kakhulu.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo.
I don't have to tell him.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba ndimxelele.
Whatever he did.	Nantoni na ayenzileyo.
Just one small problem with it.	Ingxaki enye nje encinci ngayo.
It will happen great to you.	Kuya kwenzeka enkulu kuwe.
However, man is not.	Nangona kunjalo, umntu akakho.
If you’re interested, that’s it.	Ukuba unomdla, yiloo nto.
Maybe one day it will.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini iya kuba njalo.
He's running the whole house now.	Uqhuba indlu yonke ngoku.
But you just love it.	Kodwa uyayithanda nje.
I want to think things through.	Ndifuna ukucinga izinto.
Her parents, her friends.	Abazali bakhe, abahlobo bakhe.
So don't think.	Ngoko musa ukucinga .
He asked for this, after which.	Wacela oku, emva koko.
I knew nothing about you.	Ndandingazi nto ngawe.
Not always, but often enough.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa rhoqo ngokwaneleyo.
Not tonight, not anytime.	Hayi ngokuhlwanje, hayi nanini na.
He had never been to his place before.	Akazange aye kwindawo yakhe ngaphambili.
This may happen soon.	Oku kunokwenzeka kungekudala.
You do not even have to go to school to do it.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba uye esikolweni ukuze uyenze.
I will have to look again and see.	Kuya kufuneka ndijonge kwakhona kwaye ndibone.
Maybe indoors or at night.	Mhlawumbi ngaphakathi okanye ebusuku.
My son got a little angry.	Unyana wam waba nomsindo kancinci.
I am even more afraid of his new girlfriend.	Ndiyoyika ngakumbi intombi yakhe entsha.
I have to say one thing.	Kufuneka ndithethe into enye.
Something strange here.	Into engaqhelekanga apha.
However, it takes a long time to find.	Nangona kunjalo, kuthatha ixesha elide ukufumana.
So you may get very angry.	Ngoko usenokuba nomsindo kakhulu.
I know that, just like you.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, njengawe.
Look at me, talk to me.	Ndijonge, uthethe nam.
And it's a bad thing to do.	Kwaye into embi ukuyenza.
It's his time, and he knows it.	Lixesha lakhe, kwaye uyayazi loo nto.
Nothing happened, really.	Akukho nto yenzekileyo, ngokwenene.
Not that he was thinking.	Akunjalo ukuba wayecinga.
One or two, maybe.	Enye okanye ezimbini, mhlawumbi.
I will say just a little bit.	Ndiza kuthetha nje kancinci.
I will not speak again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndithethe.
To me, this is it.	Kum, yile nto.
This is very difficult, however.	Oku kunzima kakhulu, nangona kunjalo.
I need to go .	Ndifuna ukuba ndihambe .
No, no, and no.	Hayi, hayi, kwaye hayi.
But then something else happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka enye ingxaki.
I have done a terrible thing to him.	Ndenze into embi kuye.
Are you here, maybe you are.	Ngaba ulapha, mhlawumbi ukhona.
I wanted to know the truth.	Ndandifuna ukwazi inyaniso.
I don't care how you do it or what you do.	Andikhathali nokuba wenza njani okanye wenza ntoni na.
He saw enough to know that it meant a problem.	Wabona ngokwaneleyo ukwazi ukuba kuthetha ingxaki.
He can speak well.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha kakuhle.
He would go with me.	Wayeza kuhamba nam.
We also know that it is not easy.	Siyazi nokuba akukho lula.
None of his.	Akukho nto yakhe.
The eldest son went to college.	Unyana omkhulu waya ekholejini.
And thank you for everything.	Kwaye enkosi ngayo yonke into.
I'm not going anywhere.	Andiyi kuya ndawo.
No, he was not.	Hayi, wayengekho.
He entered my house.	Wangena endlini yam.
But he knew why.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kwakutheni.
I made a plan.	Ndenza icebo.
You have to buy this.	Kufuneka uthenge oku.
Then he looked ahead.	Emva koko wajonga phambili.
You never knew anything else.	Awuzange wazi enye into.
My dad doesn't want to talk to me.	Utata akafuni kuthetha nam.
If you are sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile .
He also went down.	Naye wangena phantsi.
However, this is not always the case.	Nangona kunjalo, akunjalo rhoqo.
So what do you think about him.	Ngoko ucinga ntoni ngaye.
I just want to know why you did it.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kutheni uyenzile.
Nothing will come easy.	Akukho nto iya kuza lula.
And maybe the answer.	Kwaye mhlawumbi impendulo.
I would love to be with you all the time.	Ndingathanda ukuba nawe ngalo lonke ixesha.
In the afternoon and after.	Emva kwemini kwaye emva koko.
But he also knows the meat.	Kodwa naye uyayazi inyama.
You will probably be here tonight.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba apha ebusuku.
You will not get anywhere if you need help.	Awuyi kufika ndawo xa ufuna uncedo.
Nobody is there now.	Akukho mntu apho ngoku.
I will not stay long in the city.	Andiyi kuhlala ixesha elide edolophini.
This, man can never do.	Oku, umntu akanakuze akwenze.
Harder than anyone knew.	Kunzima kunokuba nabani na wayesazi.
I did this to him.	Ndenze lento kuye.
He always comes first.	Usoloko efika kuqala.
I just want to play.	Ndifuna nje ukudlala.
It really works, really hard.	Usebenza ngokwenene, nzima ngokwenene.
He wanted to talk, say something.	Wayefuna ukuthetha, athethe into.
Man, that's it.	Mntu, yiloo nto ke.
You really have to wait here.	Ngenene kufuneka ulinde apha.
Eventually he went down on his own.	Ekugqibeleni wehla ngokwakhe.
A little dog or any cat he wants.	Inja encinci okanye nayiphi na ikati ayifunayo.
Finally you have felt it.	Ekugqibeleni uye waziva.
It will or will not happen.	Kuya kwenzeka okanye akuyi kwenzeka.
I know you will.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuyenza.
You're right about it.	Ulungile kuyo.
Again, this is just me.	Kwakhona, oku ndim kuphela.
Well, there is no reason for that.	Ewe, akukho sizathu sokuba.
So, for sure.	Ngoko, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He wanted to talk about everything.	Wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo yonke into.
But he did not want to go home.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuya ekhaya.
Maybe someone else will see something.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu uya kubona into.
I want to make a decision.	Ndifuna ukuthatha isigqibo.
Did you do wrong ?.	Ngaba wenze kakubi?.
There is a message there.	Kukho umyalezo apho.
And not just one.	Kwaye hayi nje enye.
Not me, but others.	Hayi mna, kodwa abanye.
Probably all of that.	Mhlawumbi yonke loo nto.
Everyone knows that today.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto namhlanje.
This means a lot of things.	Oku kuthetha izinto ezininzi.
This seems like a try.	Oku kubonakala ngathi ukuzama.
I thought he was going to leave.	Ndandicinga ukuba sele eza kuhamba.
Because something is coming.	Kuba kukho into ezayo.
So it will be difficult.	Ngoko kuya kuba nzima.
I can't stay with him.	Andikwazi ukuhlala naye.
Do not give up waiting.	Musa ukuyeka ukulinda kwakho.
Eventually, it will happen.	Ekugqibeleni, kuya kwenzeka.
You are right? 	Ulungile?
There is nothing wrong with that.	Akukho nokuba nzima kuloo nto.
You’ll get one at a time, though.	Uya kufumana enye ngexesha, nangona.
This would be nice.	Oku kunokuba kulungile.
Rethink.	Ukucinga kwakhona.
Looks like you're interested in someone else.	Kubonakala ngathi unomdla komnye umntu.
He has been away for a few weeks.	Ube engekho iiveki ezimbalwa.
His mind, of course.	Ingqondo yakhe, kunjalo.
See how it goes.	Jonga ukuba kuhamba njani.
I wanted to play very badly.	Ndandifuna ukudlala kakubi kakhulu.
Stop doing it.	Yeka ukuyenza.
I don't remember any more.	Andikhumbuli kukho enye.
But you can't succeed.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuphumelela.
I just think everyone should try harder.	Ndicinga nje ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka azame ngakumbi.
He did not eat all day.	Akazange atye imini yonke.
Something very unusual is happening today.	Kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga namhlanje.
You play with him.	Udlala ngaye.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Kufuneka kube yintoni, iya kuba njalo.
But there was nobody there now.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu ngoku.
Everyone is fine, except me.	Wonke umntu ulungile, ngaphandle kwam.
Almost, but for now.	Phantse, kodwa okwangoku.
So we had to do two things.	Ngoko, kwafuneka senze izinto ezimbini.
I should not have to struggle to find a job.	Akufunekanga ndibe nzima ukufumana umsebenzi.
I could not do this.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza oku.
And again today.	Kwaye kwakhona namhlanje.
Or, don't.	Okanye, musa.
If death is so, it should not be so difficult.	Ukuba ukufa kunjalo, akufanele kube nzima kakhulu.
You can be ahead.	Unokuba ngaphambili.
Not just two.	Hayi ezimbini kuphela.
You know you're out here.	Uyayazi ukuba ulapha phandle.
How difficult it is for you to know that.	Kunzima kangakanani kuwe ukwazi oko.
Everyone thinks you are here.	Wonke umntu ucinga ukuba ulapha.
He did not agree to be a friend at work.	Akazange avume ukuba ngumhlobo emsebenzini.
Just tell me who it is.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ngubani.
I know that, absolutely.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngokupheleleyo.
Yes, her bedroom.	Ewe, igumbi lakhe lokulala.
But not alone.	Kodwa hayi yedwa.
No one knows and no one should know.	Akukho mntu uyazi kwaye akukho mntu kufuneka azi.
And now there is someone else who will be staying here.	Kwaye ngoku kukho omnye umntu oza kuhlala apha.
So that makes it very difficult.	Ngoko oko kwenza kube nzima kakhulu.
Again, he seemed to be successful.	Kwakhona, wabonakala ukuba uphumelele.
He is leaving tomorrow.	Uza kuhamba ngomso.
His mother, really.	Umama wakhe, ngokwenene.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza ngale nto.
Do not think that you have to do this all the time.	Musa ukucinga ukuba kufuneka wenze oku ngalo lonke ixesha.
Stop doing things and whatever.	Yeka ukwenza izinto nokuba yintoni na.
That is power.	Oko ngamandla.
It can be a very bad thing.	Inokuba yinto embi kakhulu.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kangako.
You want a story.	Ufuna ibali.
Or maybe nothing at all.	Okanye mhlawumbi akukho nto kwaphela.
So he went to it.	Ngoko waya kuyo.
I'd like to come, too.	Ndingathanda ukuza, nam.
It just so happens that it does.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba kube njalo.
And one day it will come to this place.	Kwaye ngenye imini iya kufika kule ndawo.
Tell it well, he suggested.	Xelela kakuhle, wacebisa.
I had to learn to walk again.	Kwafuneka ndifunde ukuhamba kwakhona.
And not man.	Kwaye hayi umntu.
Ready to go?.	Le ukuhamba?.
I would love to do it again and again.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
Maybe it's a good thing though.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle kunjalo.
Nobody talks about that.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngolo hlobo.
One to go.	Omnye ukuya.
But especially for me.	Kodwa ngakumbi kum.
I know you know all this, too.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi konke oku, nawe.
Moreover, he did not drive.	Ngaphezu koko, akazange aqhube.
Finally he thought of something.	Ekugqibeleni wacinga ngento ethile.
We have not been together.	Khange sibe kunye.
This means either, or, or, or.	Oku kuthetha okanye, okanye, okanye.
But I'm not sure anymore.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga kwakhona.
But he said all of us.	Kodwa wathi sonke.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye ke leyo.
Not if you are busy.	Hayi ukuba uxakekile.
Maybe something happened there.	Mhlawumbi kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
It is very necessary.	Kufuneka kakhulu.
This is your new person.	Ngumntu wakho omtsha lo.
I tried to work.	Ndazama ukusebenza.
Always, always, always.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, rhoqo, rhoqo.
But today, we have made peace with it.	Kodwa namhlanje, senze uxolo nayo.
I'm really sorry.	Ndiyaxolisa ngokwenene.
Then he asked for help from me.	Emva koko wacela uncedo kum.
Now not so much.	Ngoku hayi kakhulu.
Work will continue.	Umsebenzi uya kuqhubeka.
Being the person he wants to meet.	Ukuba ngumntu afuna ukudibana naye.
Eventually he has to leave.	Ekugqibeleni kufuneka ahambe.
You will not have it.	Awuyi kuba nayo.
He stays home all the time.	Uhlala ekhaya rhoqo.
If he had hope.	Ukuba wayenethemba.
Anything at all.	Nantoni na kwaphela.
I have only done it once.	Ndiyenzile kanye kuphela.
But in this case, yes.	Kodwa kule meko, ewe kunjalo.
Please, do not.	Nceda, musa .
I want to see his eyes again.	Ndifuna ukubona amehlo akhe kwakhona.
Probably a lot of people.	Mhlawumbi abantu abaninzi.
So, please, take a look.	Ngoko ke, nceda, ndijonge.
But man, that's right.	Kodwa umntu, kunjalo.
And the woman says something to you about it.	Kwaye umfazi uthetha into kuwe ngayo.
He will have to plead guilty.	Kuya kufuneka avume ityala.
She is passionate and determined.	Unomdla kwaye uzimisele.
I don't remember, of course.	Andikhumbuli, kunjalo.
So far everything is fine.	Kude kube ngoku yonke into ilungile.
So now.	Ngoko ngoku.
I didn't want to have a party.	Ndandingafuni ukwenza itheko.
He does not want to talk about what happened.	Akafuni kuthetha ngale nto yenzekileyo.
I do not want to see her again.	Andifuni ndiphinde ndimbone.
We all know how it will end.	Sonke siyazi ukuba iza kuphela njani.
It happened to you.	Kwenzeke kuwe.
He certainly agreed.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wavuma.
But no one speaks.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha.
You live outside, you work hard every day.	Uhlala ngaphandle, usebenza nzima yonke imihla.
But the fact is that they live at home.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba bahlala ekhaya.
Of course it was not easy.	Ewe kucacile ukuba kwakungekho lula.
How did this happen.	Kwenzeka njani oku.
Maybe he wanted to tell you himself.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukukuxelela ngokwakhe.
There was no one before.	Kwakungekho mntu ngaphambili.
It certainly makes it even more fun to play.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwenza kube mnandi ngakumbi ukudlala.
You are looking in the wrong place.	Ujonge kwindawo engalunganga.
But you want to be a better person.	Kodwa ufuna ukuba ngumntu ongcono.
We want to know what you think about it.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni ngayo.
We'll just see.	Siza kubona nje.
There you are, yes.	Nantso ke, ewe.
Same old problem.	Ingxaki efanayo endala.
But soon we will be leaving.	Kodwa kungekudala siza kuhamba.
I don't even know when.	Andazi nokuba nini.
But it doesn't hurt.	Kodwa hayi buhlungu.
I do not want to be in that situation again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndibe kuloo meko.
He got a call.	Wafumana umnxeba.
He did more.	Wayenza ngakumbi.
Not so fast, of course.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza, kunjalo.
There is no doing things or eating.	Akukho ukwenza izinto okanye ukutya.
So you want these.	Ngoko ufuna ezi.
I didn't want him to tell me.	Bendingafuni andixelele.
Alcohol, food, flowers.	Utywala, ukutya, iintyatyambo.
You know what, maybe not.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He doesn't have to think about it.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba acinge ngayo.
No matter how long you have.	Nokuba unexesha elingakanani na.
He must have wanted me to come.	Ufanele ukuba afune ndize.
But not your fault.	Kodwa hayi ityala lakho.
There was no reason for him to go there.	Kwakungekho sizathu sokuba aye apho.
I know you can read my mind.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyakwazi ukufunda ingqondo yam.
I don't understand why either.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni nam.
So much for the whole day.	Kakhulu imini yonke.
He would just find a way.	Wayeza kufumana nje indlela.
Let me look at something else.	Makhe ndijonge enye into.
I think you want money.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna imali.
I have to go.	Ndifanele ukuhamba.
However, you will succeed after that.	Nangona kunjalo, uya kuphumelela emva koko.
I think that's a big deal.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto enkulu.
There is no reason to be out here.	Akukho sizathu sokuba apha phandle.
Just a little bit, thank you.	Kancinci nje, enkosi.
He tried to speak slowly.	Wazama ukuthetha kancinci.
He did not stay there long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide apho.
I don't want to see it again.	Andifuni kubona kwakhona.
But really, there is.	Kodwa ngokwenene, kukho.
And then it's a big deal.	Kwaye ke yinto enkulu.
I thought well of him for that.	Ndandicinga kakuhle ngaye ngaloo nto.
The question is what to do.	Umbuzo kukuba wenze ntoni.
It will be fine but not impossible.	Kuya kuba kuhle kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Without him, it could be even better.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kunokuba ngcono ngakumbi.
Mary and me.	UMary kunye nam.
He did not know about her at the time.	Wayengazi ngaye ngelo xesha.
But he would not be so.	Kodwa wayengayi kuba njalo.
He was completely scared.	Wayesoyika ngokupheleleyo.
You do a lot of this.	Uyenza kakhulu lento.
Almost like an adult.	Phantse ngathi mdala.
And he never could do that.	Kwaye akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I will do something.	Ndiya kwenza into.
Now or later.	Ngoku okanye kamva.
Well, maybe there is.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kukho.
I'll talk about him later.	Ndiza kuthetha ngaye kamva.
I never thought about him.	Khange ndicinge ngaye.
You must go for help.	Kumele ukuba uye kufuna uncedo.
Certainly not me !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi mna!.
He knows but he doesn't know what it is right now.	Uyazi kodwa akazi ukuba yintoni okwangoku.
I think you should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube naye.
But he does not have to.	Kodwa akufuneki ukuba enjenjalo.
He did so later.	Wakwenza oko kamva.
Life with us.	Ubomi kunye nathi.
Especially at night.	Kakhulu ebusuku.
I didn't know much about it.	Ndandingazi nto ingako ngayo.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo .
But not difficult, or long.	Kodwa hayi nzima, okanye ixesha elide.
But first.	Kodwa kuqala .
I like that way.	Ndiyayithanda loo ndlela.
You know, you just want to be yourself.	Uyazi, ufuna nje ukuba nguwe.
But it goes too far.	Kodwa iya kude kakhulu.
He wanted the job.	Wayefuna lo msebenzi.
But he did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke kuloo nto.
No one knew about this.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngale nto.
But no one is looking my way.	Kodwa akukho mntu ujonge indlela yam.
I think a lot of you.	Ndicinga kakhulu ngawe.
No problem no problem.	Akukho ngxaki akukho ngxaki.
But because of me.	Kodwa ngenxa yam.
He lost his mind.	Wachitha ingqondo yakhe.
You just want to take a picture.	Ufuna nje ukuthatha umfanekiso.
But, besides, he did not want to eat with us.	Kodwa, ngaphandle koko, wayengafuni ukutya nathi.
We will need another.	Siza kufuna enye.
She says she loves him too.	Uthi naye uyamthanda.
No one knew the other.	Akukho mntu wayesazi omnye.
It will be the same thing.	Kuya kuba yinto enye.
It takes time, of course.	Kuthatha ixesha, ngokwenene kunjalo.
And everything new.	Kunye nayo yonke into entsha.
I would love to see what you do with it.	Ndingathanda ukubona ukuba wenza ntoni ngayo.
I would like to get some money.	Ndingathanda ukufumana imali.
His place of residence.	Indawo yakhe yokuhlala.
Many will get there.	Abaninzi baya kufika apho.
My mother was the first to leave.	Umama waba ngowokuqala ukuhamba.
I forgot the time.	Ndilibele ixesha.
See more of my story here !.	Jonga ngakumbi ibali lam apha!.
Maybe not for years.	Mhlawumbi hayi iminyaka.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, kunjalo kunjalo.
I'm sure you know about me.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayazi ngam.
I could not stop thinking about you.	Andikwazanga ukuyeka ukucinga ngawe.
Only then has music become a big thing.	Kuphela ngaloo ndlela umculo uye waba yinto enkulu.
He stays home all night.	Uhlala engekho ekhaya ubusuku bonke.
It’s not hard to make my way to a place.	Akukho nzima ukwenza indlela yam kwindawo.
He looked much better.	Wayebonakala engcono kakhulu.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga njalo .
Everyone else said it was okay.	Bonke abanye bathi kulungile.
He never tried to say it.	Akazange azame ukuyithetha.
He thought he would have to do it.	Wayecinga ukuba kuya kufuneka enze.
And food, of course.	Kwaye ukutya, kunjalo.
All his life.	Bonke ubomi bakhe bonke.
And I tried again.	Kwaye ndazama kwakhona.
I have no other choice.	Andinayo enye indlela.
He pulled out his gun.	Wakhupha umpu wakhe.
But in everything else.	Kodwa kuyo yonke enye into.
Mary alone.	UMariya yedwa.
And one, two, and one.	Kwaye enye, ezimbini, kunye.
He goes late.	Uhamba late.
absolutely not.	ngokupheleleyo akunjalo.
But when you are ready.	Kodwa xa sele ulungile .
Always no, no.	Ngalo lonke ixesha hayi, hayi.
This should not be difficult.	Oku akufuneki kube nzima.
And you do, too.	Kwaye uyayenza, nawe.
He wanted the same thing.	Wayefuna into efanayo.
We do not have to rebuild.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba sakhe kwakhona.
To my knowledge.	Ukwazi kwam.
The strangest thing is that you have logged in.	Into engaqhelekanga kukuba uye wangena.
And there is a mother.	Kwaye kukho umama.
He tried to sit down.	Wazama ukuhlala phantsi.
He had to get inside her now.	Kwafuneka angene ngaphakathi kuye ngoku.
However, for now, this is not the case.	Nangona kunjalo, ngoku, oku akunjalo.
This is it, he realized.	Yiyo le, waqonda.
I couldn’t, too.	Andikwazanga, kakhulu.
And then, after that, we'll see what happens.	Kwaye ke, emva koko, siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
It was not possible to know everything.	Akuzange kwenzeke ukwazi yonke into.
We will buy first.	Siza kuthenga kuqala.
It's as good as it was made.	Ilungile njengoko yenziwe.
I think a lot of things.	Ndicinga izinto ezininzi.
But again, there is no need.	Kodwa kwakhona, akukho mfuneko.
But your answer.	Kodwa impendulo yakho.
Really really.	Ngenene ngenene.
This is it.	Lo nguye.
This goes on for hours.	Oku kuqhubeka iiyure.
In this case, it will be a doctor.	Kule meko, kuya kuba ngugqirha.
You must come to the hospital.	Kufuneka uze esibhedlele.
But he is not really there.	Kodwa akakho ngokwenene apho.
It’s really hard, really.	Kunzima ngokwenene, ngenene.
But that.	Kodwa ukuba .
It is clear that you are expecting someone.	Kucacile ukuba ulindele umntu.
He opened a case.	Wavula ityala.
Nobody wanted this to happen.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuba kwenzeke oku.
I will always try to have more children than you.	Ndiya kuhlala ndizama ukuba nabantwana abaninzi kunawe.
She ran to his side.	Wabaleka waya ecaleni kwakhe.
So he went and got another one.	Wahamba ke wathatha enye.
And it can be hard to stop playing.	Kwaye kunokuba nzima ukuyeka ukudlala.
Another, small house.	Enye, indlu encinci.
You have to stay here in the city.	Kufuneka uhlale apha edolophini.
Finally he went out to lunch.	Ekugqibeleni waphuma waya kwisidlo sasemini.
He said he couldn't speak for sure.	Wathi akakwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
We did it.	Senze ngayo.
Except in this case.	Ngaphandle kule meko.
I feel completely alone.	Ndiziva ndedwa ngokupheleleyo.
I want a good tv.	Ndifuna itv elungileyo.
But the truth is, he wanted to get out.	Kodwa inyaniso kukuba, wayefuna ukuphuma.
You're all right.	Ulungile wonke.
But no one ever did that.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakha wakwenza oku.
But in the meantime, he has to stay.	Kodwa okwangoku, kufuneka ahlale.
Either way, everything is fine.	Nokuba yeyiphi na indlela, konke kulungile.
It can be good, really.	Inokuba kuhle, ngokwenene.
Just like you work with me.	Kanye njengokuba usebenza nam.
He too came out.	Naye waphuma.
So, again, here.	Ngoko, kwakhona, apha.
It could be anything, really.	Inokuba yiyo nantoni na, ngenene.
It is also very unlikely.	Kwakhona akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
And he thought.	Kwaye wayecinga.
I can't talk too much right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu ngoku.
Like you or me.	Njengawe okanye mna.
You're tired, so much so.	Udiniwe, ngoko kakhulu.
This would be a good thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto entle.
It takes all my time.	Kuthatha ixesha lam lonke.
We'll wait until you're ready.	Siza kulinda de ube ulungile.
I think it could be better.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokuba ngcono.
He's really smart, you know.	Ukrelekrele ngenene, uyazi.
I want you too.	Nam ndifuna wena.
Maybe he left quickly.	Mhlawumbi wahamba ngokukhawuleza.
But only as you want.	Kodwa kuphela njengoko ufuna.
I'm sure you know.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi.
Then he will be back tomorrow.	Emva koko uya kubuya ngomso.
I have come a long way.	Ndize kude.
And you feel good.	Kwaye uziva ulungile.
Side window.	Ifestile ecaleni.
But it will certainly happen sooner rather than later.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
And no one knew.	Kwaye akukho mntu wayesazi.
I don't want to be with you like that.	Andifuni kuba nawe ngolo hlobo.
Do you know what it is?	Ngaba uyazi ukuba yintoni?
Better than you think.	Ungcono kunokuba ucinga.
Do not be angry with him.	Musa ukuba nomsindo kuye.
I know the language.	Ndiyayazi intetho.
This makes it really difficult to control yourself.	Oku kwenza ukuba kube nzima ngokwenene ukuzibamba.
No one.	Akukho mntu .
He's here, so just look.	Ulapha, ngoko jonga nje.
They will do well no matter what.	Baya kwenza kakuhle nokuba kwenzeka ntoni.
And now maybe you would like to be alone.	Kwaye ngoku mhlawumbi ungathanda ukuba wedwa.
I apologize for that.	Ndiye ndenza uxolo ngalonto.
That he will never do.	Loo nto soze ayenze.
And your friends.	Kunye nabahlobo bakho.
He would see! 	Wayeza kubona!
There is an answer somewhere.	Kukho impendulo kwindawo ethile.
One big mistake.	Impazamo enye enkulu.
He did not speak to her.	Zange athethe naye.
I did not want to.	Bendingafuni njalo.
We will not need anything.	Asiyi kufuna nto.
You will talk to me.	Uya kuthetha nam.
Now it is almost impossible to stop.	Ngoku phantse akunakwenzeka ukuyeka.
You should already have it.	Bekufanele ukuba sele unayo.
Another good thing.	Enye into entle.
It never was, really.	Akuzange kube njalo, ngokwenene.
He says he knows he thinks everything.	Uthi uyazi ukuba ucinga yonke into.
I went to talk to him.	Ndaya kuthetha naye.
But what is worse.	Kodwa yintoni embi ngakumbi.
It will definitely be fun.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba mnandi.
There, there, now.	Apho, apho, ngoku.
You know that, too.	Uyayazi loo nto, nawe.
What's wrong with you? 	Yintoni engalunganga ngawe?
I just wanted to buy time.	Bendifuna nje ukuthenga ixesha.
Nobody did it all by himself.	Akukho mntu wakwenza konke eyedwa.
That would be great !!!!!	Oko kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu!!!!!
The sooner it gets better.	Ngokukhawuleza kuya kuba ngcono.
I don't want any money from him.	Andifuni mali kuye.
Maybe it shouldn’t happen.	Mhlawumbi akufanele kwenzeke.
There is no reason at all to be sad.	Akukho sizathu konke konke sokuba buhlungu.
Finally the answer.	Ekugqibeleni impendulo.
Not my wife.	Hayi umfazi wam.
You will be beautiful to him.	Uya kuba mhle kuye.
It has to be visible.	Kufuneka abonakale.
No one will want to stay here.	Akukho mntu uya kufuna ukuhlala apha.
Then there are others.	Emva koko kukho abanye.
I know all of that, thank you very much.	Ndiyayazi yonke loo nto, enkosi kakhulu.
However, he died shortly thereafter.	Kodwa, wafa kungekudala emva koko.
I think we did a good job.	Ndicinga ukuba senze umsebenzi omhle.
This seems to be a very bad thing.	Oku kubonakala ngathi yinto embi kakhulu.
It should, it should, it should.	Kufuneka, kufuneka, kufuneka.
They said.	Baye bathi.
He just got into it.	Wangena nje kuyo.
And tell everyone about it.	Kwaye uxelele wonke umntu ngayo.
He did nothing for her.	Akazange enze nto ngaye.
Attention is just this.	Ingqalelo yile nto nje.
Our work and all that.	Umsebenzi wethu kunye nayo yonke loo nto.
Then it is clear.	Emva koko kucacile.
You must be good at it.	Umele ukuba ulungile kuyo.
I would like to work now.	Ndingathanda ukusebenza ngoku.
I will tell the truth.	Ndiza kuthetha inyaniso.
He looked in front of her.	Wajonga phambi kwakhe.
Well, we'll do it here.	Kulungile, siza kuyenza apha.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani na.
I just love your speech.	Ndiyayithanda nje intetho yakho.
The problem is, no one else is going to do it.	Ingxaki kukuba, akakho omnye umntu oza kuyenza.
Again, maybe there is a better way.	Kwakhona, mhlawumbi kukho indlela engcono.
Just look at your food.	Jonga nje ukutya kwakho.
Retirement is not easy.	Ukuthatha umhlala-phantsi akukho lula.
And you know it.	Kwaye ukwazi wena.
As it is, tomorrow morning.	Njengokuba kunjalo, ngomso kusasa.
He decided to talk.	Wagqiba kwelokuba athethe.
It means something for the rest of your life.	Kuthetha into ethile ubomi bakho bonke.
He really has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokwenene.
But he still tried to do so.	Kodwa nangona kunjalo wazama ukwenjenjalo.
Others will want you.	Abanye baya kufuna wena.
There are a lot of people there.	Kukho abantu abaninzi apho.
Or even a friend.	Okanye nokuba ngumhlobo.
Now but now.	Ngoku kodwa ngoku.
They say time is everything.	Bathi ixesha yinto yonke.
You will probably say yes.	Mhlawumbi uya kuthi ewe.
I'm talking about all of that.	Ndithetha ngayo yonke loo nto.
There is death in it.	Kukho ukufa kuyo.
And then .	Ke ngoku .
He does that a lot in my house.	Uyenza lonto kakhulu endlini yam.
Virtually everyone does.	Ngokwenene wonke umntu wenza njalo.
Just, it really hurts.	Nje, buhlungu ngokwenene.
I want one now.	Ndifuna enye ngoku.
I can't get out of here.	Andikwazi ukuphuma apha.
If you do that you will be with me.	Ukuba wenza njalo uzakuba nam.
I did not want this to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke le nto.
Taking a night out will not be a bad thing.	Ukuthatha ubusuku akuyi kuba yinto embi.
Soon everyone was talking.	Kungekudala wonke umntu wayethetha.
He arrived yesterday.	Ufike izolo.
In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine. "	Ngalo lonke ixesha, impendulo ilungile kakhulu.
Now, there is.	Ngoku, kukho.
We have been coming here for a long time.	Kudala siza apha.
But he will succeed.	Kodwa uya kuphumelela.
People will go.	Abantu baya kuhamba.
Anyone, really.	Nabani na, ngenene.
Maybe, and maybe not.	Mhlawumbi, kwaye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He immediately began talking about it.	Ngoko nangoko waqalisa ukuthetha ngayo.
You know that you will eventually reach it.	Uyazi ukuba uya kufika kuyo ekugqibeleni.
It could be you !.	Inokuba nguwe!.
He told someone else.	Waxelela omnye umntu.
He never did that.	Khange ayenze loo nto.
A little, maybe.	Kancinci, mhlawumbi.
He thought a lot, not a little.	Wayecinga okuninzi, hayi kancinci.
Now comes the question.	Ngoku kuza umbuzo.
I just wanted something better.	Ndandifuna nje into entle ngakumbi.
We'll try some things first.	Siza kuzama ezinye izinto kuqala.
Some said thank you.	Abanye bathi enkosi.
Also out.	Kwakhona ukuphuma.
But it will take time to work.	Kodwa kuya kuthatha ixesha ukusebenza.
I can't wait to read everything in this book.	Andikwazi kulinda ukufunda yonke into kule ncwadi.
How to make more money.	Indlela yokwenza imali eninzi.
He actually went to school.	Wathi nyani waya esikolweni.
But we will not be here then.	Kodwa asiyi kuba lapha ngoko.
Image, maybe.	Umfanekiso, mhlawumbi.
You are playing well now.	Udlala kakuhle ngoku.
We will all go.	Siya kuhamba sonke.
No, he certainly did not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
I will never go there.	Soze ndiye apho.
Or it seemed, of course.	Okanye kwakubonakala, kunjalo.
He won't always talk, but he knows.	Akayi kuhlala ethetha, kodwa uyazi.
You certainly know about me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi ngam.
Not that it would be a bad thing.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kuba yinto embi.
But he talks a lot.	Kodwa uthetha kakhulu.
I want to see my children.	Ndifuna ukubona abantwana bam.
Here I am.	Apha nam.
My big house.	Indlu yam enkulu.
But he may not know it.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akayazi loo nto.
I don't see anything there.	Andiboni nto tu apho.
Fast forward to that afternoon.	Ngokukhawuleza phambili ngaloo mvakwemini.
Do whatever it takes to succeed.	Ukwenza nantoni na ukuze uphumelele.
I don't know why right now, or who.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okwangoku, nokuba ngubani.
Thank you everyone, thank you.	Enkosi wonke umntu, enkosi.
I looked everywhere.	Ndijonge yonke indawo.
Flowers on the bed.	Iintyatyambo ebhedini.
I don't know what's going on here.	Andazi kwenzeka ntoni apha.
But now it seems.	Kodwa ngoku kubonakala kunjalo.
But, in this case, do not.	Kodwa, kule meko, musa.
No one did the best he could.	Akukho mntu wenza into engcono ayenzileyo.
So do not leave the house.	Ngoko musa ukuphuma endlwini.
I never read books.	Andizange ndifunde iincwadi.
He came home talking about this.	Wafika ekhaya ethetha ngale nto.
No one speaks the other way.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngenye indlela.
He just didn't think.	Akazange acinge tu.
Certainly this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
Even if you are late.	Nokuba ufike emva kwexesha.
he did not go to school.	khange aye esikolweni.
Clearly this.	Ngokucacileyo lo.
Everything is going very well.	Konke kuhamba kakhulu.
Not tomorrow, now.	Hayi ngomso, ngoku.
Then we will see something.	Emva koko siza kubona into.
With him, or with him alone.	Naye, okanye naye kuphela.
He slept very slowly.	Walala kancinci kakhulu.
He did not leave on time.	Akazange ahambe ngexesha.
Probably because he looked good.	Mhlawumbi ngenxa yokuba wayekhangeleka kakuhle.
But he did not want to be with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba kunye naye.
I never told anyone about it.	Khange ndixelele mntu ngayo.
But you mean something else.	Kodwa uthetha enye into.
Me and the kids.	Mna nabantwana.
We did nothing.	Asizange senze nto.
I thought they would.	Ndacinga ukuba baya kuba njalo.
I will always be back.	Ndiza kubuya rhoqo.
Thank you very much, but no.	Enkosi kakhulu, kodwa hayi.
But now he knew.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi.
Inside there is nothing.	Ngaphakathi akukho nto.
If something is wrong.	Ukuba kukho into engalunganga.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukwenza njalo.
My father knows nothing about it.	Utata akazi nto ngayo.
I know him at work.	Ndiyamazi emsebenzini.
But also.	Kodwa, kwakhona.
Good work and always interesting.	Umsebenzi omhle kwaye uhlala unomdla.
My father came to me then.	Utata weza kum ngoko.
Otherwise, no problem has arisen.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho ngxaki yenzekileyo.
He remained absent.	Wahlala engekho.
One mother.	Umama omnye.
In the evening, he would tell her.	Ngokuhlwa, wayeza kumxelela.
If there are errors.	Ukuba kukho iimpazamo.
Very good thing, very much.	Into entle kakhulu, kakhulu.
Someone to be his friend.	Umntu oza kuba ngumhlobo wakhe.
A little bit of everything, really.	Kancinci kuyo yonke into, ngokwenene.
Like, nothing happened.	Njengokuba, akukho nto yenzekileyo.
I just didn't come here and do this.	Khange ndize nje apha ndenze lento.
However, there is one that is much better.	Nangona kunjalo, kukho enye engcono kakhulu.
One question though.	Umbuzo omnye nangona.
Not so much that you succeed, but when.	Akukho kakhulu nokuba uphumelele, kodwa nini.
I don't know, maybe.	Andazi, mhlawumbi.
Thanks no.	Enkosi hayi.
No one should do anything about it.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze nantoni na kuyo.
I need to see my daughter.	Kufuneka ndibone intombi yam.
You talk a little bit about that.	Uthetha kancinci ngaloo nto.
And not some more.	Kwaye hayi ezinye.
He knows he won't.	Uyazi ukuba akasayi.
He really did not know where his wife had gone.	Ngokwenene wayengazi ukuba umfazi wakhe uye phi.
Well, I love that.	Ewe, ndiyayithanda loo nto.
Surely, you must know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, umele ukuba uyazi.
I think you went to school.	Ndicinga ukuba uye wafunda esikolweni.
But perhaps he did not succeed there.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akazange aphumelele apho.
And all this? 	Kwaye konke oku?
At first, she thought he was just a friend.	Ekuqaleni, wayecinga ukuba ngumhlobo.
I also doubt it.	Kwakhona ndiyathandabuza.
But that will happen later.	Kodwa oko kuya kamva.
He said yes he is.	Wathi ewe nguye.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kuba njalo.
Everyone, yes.	Wonke umntu, ewe.
But he finally realized that he needed to talk.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba kufuneka athethe.
And he did a great job.	Kwaye wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
No one thought there was anything wrong with this.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ukuba kukho into engalunganga kule nto.
You know that mom is just waiting for you.	Uyazi ukuba umama ulinde wena kuphela.
He stayed the whole time.	Wahlala lonke ixesha.
And he lay there.	Walala apho ke.
It was clear he would never.	Kwakucacile ukuba akanakuze.
Also out of time.	Kwakhona ngaphandle kwexesha.
Stop living in it.	Yeka ukuhlala kuyo.
Probably not at all tonight.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela ngokuhlwanje.
No one, but no one.	Akukho mntu, kodwa akukho mntu.
I wondered what his house could be like.	Ndacinga ukuba inokuba njani indlu yakhe.
Any, really.	Nayiphi na, ngokwenene.
Her children.	Abantwana bakhe.
So we will start everything.	Ngoko siza kuqala yonke into.
I'm looking to get out.	Ndijonge ukuphuma.
And you did a good job.	Kwaye wenze umsebenzi olungileyo.
She has finished eating.	Uye wagqiba ukutya.
He asked me to wait two hours.	Wandicela ukuba ndilinde iiyure ezimbini.
I know it will appear.	Ndiyazi ukuba iya kubonakala.
But you should talk to him.	Kodwa kuya kufuneka uthethe naye.
I did the right thing.	Ndenza into elungileyo.
I think it comes in handy.	Ndicinga ukuba iza kakuhle.
Yes, almost no problem.	Ewe, phantse akukho ngxaki.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba yinyani.
He saw that she was afraid.	Wabona ukuba uyoyika.
But this is too far away.	Kodwa oku kude kakhulu.
He said that it certainly is.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo kunjalo.
He wants to be.	Ufuna ukuba njalo.
He said he did.	Wathi uyenzile.
Then he does not know what will happen.	Emva koko akazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni na.
He knew better than he thought.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba acinge.
Will it be too difficult for us?	Ngaba kuya kuba nzima kakhulu kuthi?
In this case, he did not.	Kule meko, akazange enjenjalo.
But, this is true.	Kodwa, le yinyani.
I have to be very alone.	Kufuneka ndibe ndedwa kakhulu.
Well done, but again.	Wenze kakuhle, kodwa kwakhona.
I wish just once.	Ndinqwenela kube kanye nje .
I really want you to come.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuba uze.
I did not tell you everything.	Andizange ndikuxelele yonke into.
Before your time.	Phambi kwexesha lakho.
My mother came in.	Wangena umama.
When necessary.	Xa kufuneka.
We have traveled here on our own.	Sihambe apha ngokwethu.
it will be so.	kuya kuba njalo.
Not a purchase.	Hayi ukuthenga.
Suddenly, she started homework.	Ngokukhawuleza, waqalisa umsebenzi wasekhaya.
I can't wait for something to come.	Andikwazi ukulinda into ezayo.
To finish too long.	Ukugqiba ixesha elide kakhulu.
Thank you so much for the time.	Enkosi kakhulu ngexesha.
Clearly, he did not want to talk.	Kucacile ukuba wayengafuni kuthetha.
Therefore, he knows everything.	Ngoko ke, wazi yonke into.
Anyone will not go, it seems.	Nokuba ngubani na akayi kuhamba, kubonakala.
You have to sit next to me now.	Kufuneka uhlale ecaleni kwam ngoku.
I'm not even sure why.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba kutheni.
I'm afraid someone is coming.	Ndiyoyika ukuba umntu uza .
And that goes all the way up.	Kwaye oko kuhamba yonke indlela ukuya phezulu.
That's not it.	Hayi loo nto.
He thought, maybe that's better.	Wacinga ukuba, mhlawumbi oko kungcono.
But there is nothing behind it.	Kodwa akukho nto emva.
You will find nothing in us.	Awuyi kufumana nto kuthi.
He never really went to school.	Akazange aye esikolweni ngokwenene.
All the time at school.	Ngalo lonke ixesha esikolweni.
No one told me anything.	Akukho mntu wandixelela nto.
Said the man.	Wathi umntu.
I know now that it is not so.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba akunjalo.
It will be much easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu kuwe.
He kept walking.	Waqhubeka uhamba.
Just tell me one thing.	Ndixelele nje into enye.
I don't want to hear about this again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndive ngale nto.
Help, finally.	Uncedo, ekugqibeleni.
For now, he didn't want to know.	Okwangoku, wayengafuni ukwazi.
Whether to stay in it or not.	Ukuba uhlale kuyo okanye hayi.
You do too.	Nawe uyayenza.
People have to go to work.	Abantu kufuneka baye emsebenzini.
My wife thinks so.	Umfazi wam ucinga njalo.
Good now.	Kuhle ngoku.
It doesn’t have to, of course.	Akunyanzelekanga, kunjalo.
I think you look good.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle.
Yeah, I love it.	Ewe, ndiyayithanda.
Of course it is.	Ewe kunjalo kunjalo.
There is no question in that.	Akukho mbuzo kuloo nto.
I wanted you to know this.	Bendifuna uyazi lento.
To me this is not the case.	Kum oku akunjalo.
I always want to learn or do something.	Ndihlala ndifuna ukufunda okanye ukwenza into.
What am I going to do.	Ndiza kwenza ntoni .
Then, we'll see what happens.	Emva koko, siza kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
But there are friends.	Kodwa kukho abahlobo.
Good to have you.	Kulungile ukuba nawe.
And with whom.	Kwaye nabani.
Then he came after her.	Emva koko wafika emva kwakhe.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kubonakala ngathi ulele.
This comes on time.	Oku kuza ngexesha.
I always feel tired.	Ndihlala ndiziva ndidiniwe.
Just how it all happened.	Kanye ukuba kwenzeke njani konke.
He has entered quickly.	Uye wangena ngokukhawuleza.
And that's a good thing, too.	Kwaye yinto elungileyo, nayo.
Tell your parents that you will stay with them.	Xelela abazali bakho ukuba uya kuhlala nawe.
I know nothing about that.	Andazi nto ngalonto.
Everyone wanted to play.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukudlala.
It doesn't have to happen.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke.
Not too far from town.	Akukho kude kakhulu edolophini.
Walking in the house.	Ukuhamba endlini.
Look at everything.	Jonga yonke into.
It's a little hard, though.	Kunzima kancinci, nangona kunjalo.
And it just takes a long time.	Kwaye kuthatha nje ixesha elide.
Let me see if it's okay.	Makhe ndijonge ukuba kulungile.
It certainly seems that way to me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala kunjalo kum.
So is everyone, too.	Unjalo wonke umntu, naye.
And that's what you knew.	Kwaye nantso into ubusazi ngayo.
You definitely want to play.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna ukudlala.
This is here.	Oku apha.
And there is truth in this.	Kwaye kukho inyaniso kule nto.
Nothing, after all.	Akukho nto, emva koko .
I am not going anywhere, I do not see anyone.	andiyi ndawo, andiboni mntu.
But a little more.	Kodwa ngakumbi kancinci.
All of that speaks well.	Konke oko kuthetha kakuhle.
I don’t want to think or talk about it.	Andifuni ukucinga okanye ukuthetha ngayo.
Slowly but frequently.	Kancinci kodwa rhoqo.
For good money.	Ngemali entle.
Maybe just three.	Mhlawumbi ezintathu nje.
He looked good.	Wajonga kakuhle.
You're right, now.	Ulungile, ngoku.
She is trying to decide what to do.	Uzama ukugqiba ngento amakayenze.
He did that for the rest of his life.	Oko wakwenza ubomi bakhe bonke.
But no one is moving fast.	Kodwa akukho mntu uhamba ngokukhawuleza.
But you have to stay away from me.	Kodwa kufuneka uhlale kude kum.
Everyone goes there.	Wonke umntu uya apho.
It could be better that way.	Kunokuba ngcono ngolo hlobo.
There is nothing here yet.	Akukho nto apha okwangoku.
Ready to go.	Ukulungele ukuhamba.
No children.	Hayi abantwana.
You drive as you are.	Uqhuba njengoko unjalo.
He must do so regularly.	Kufuneka akwenze oko rhoqo.
You are always here.	Uhlala ulapha.
Suddenly, in everything a lot.	Ngokukhawuleza, kuyo yonke into eninzi.
As we want it to be.	Njengoko sifuna ukuba.
It will take too long.	Kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu .
Most of the time you are fine.	Ixesha elininzi ulungile.
There is help there.	Kukho uncedo apho.
Now, give me the whole story.	Ngoku, ndinike lonke ibali.
I want to stay in it.	Ndifuna ukuhlala kuyo.
But only him.	Kodwa naye kuphela.
Doing it is not difficult.	Ukwenza akukho nzima.
But he has to go home.	Kodwa kufuneka agoduke.
you have definitely won.	uphumelele ngokuqinisekileyo.
Look the other way.	Jonga enye indlela.
My whole house.	Yonke indlu yam.
So you think a little bit.	Ngoko ucinga kancinci.
That's why you should not do that.	Yiyo loo nto akufanele uyenze loo nto.
Maybe not then, but now.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngelo xesha, kodwa ngoku.
But you probably already know that.	Kodwa mhlawumbi sele ukwazi oko.
Not so much more.	Hayi kakhulu ngakumbi.
After a while he finished.	Emva kwexesha wagqiba.
It just seemed to be something to do.	Kwakubonakala nje ukuba yinto yokwenza.
I never thought he should do that.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ufanele enjenjalo.
He just walked into town.	Wangena nje edolophini.
He was afraid he was going to leave.	Wayesoyika ukuba uzimisele ukuhamba.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha kukwazi.
Three children.	Abantwana abathathu.
And he had to do it alone.	Kwaye kwafuneka ayenze yedwa.
He acted in an unusual way.	Wenza ngendlela engaqhelekanga ngayo.
And then, if something happened to him.	Kwaye ke, ukuba kukho into eyenzekileyo kuye.
It's hard every day.	Kunzima yonke imihla.
I heard a lot about it.	Ndive kakhulu ngayo.
Not now though.	Hayi ngoku kodwa.
Maybe he didn't know why.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi ukuba kwakutheni.
Then the truth.	Emva koko inyaniso.
He looks better now.	Ubonakala engcono ngoku.
You will only see flowers.	Uya kubona nje iintyatyambo.
Yes, not once, but you will see.	Ewe, hayi kanye, kodwa uya kubona.
You will always be good to him.	Uya kuhlala ulungile kuye.
And so he says yes.	Kwaye ngoko uthi ewe.
I hope it gets better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba iza kulungile.
This is it.	Oku koko.
It would be better for him.	Kunokuba kuhle kuye.
I know for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Yes, it is true at this time.	Ewe, yinyani ngeli xesha.
He has to eat.	Kufuneka atye.
You would like to have it otherwise.	Ungathanda ukuba nayo ngenye indlela.
He did not want to, but he did.	Wayengafuni, kodwa wenza njalo.
I can't get to do this.	Andikwazi ukufumana ukwenza oku.
If they will have him, that's it.	Ukuba baya kuba naye, yiloo nto.
Simplify the mind.	Lula ingqondo.
And here they are all.	Kwaye apha bonke.
And yes, we will go later.	Kwaye ewe, siya kuhamba kamva.
You have never done this before.	Awuzange uyenze ngolu hlobo ngaphambili.
I can't be without him.	Andikwazi ukuba ngaphandle kwakhe.
Not if you have to.	Akunjalo ukuba kufuneka.
For three years.	Kwaphela iminyaka emithathu.
He slept for a while.	Wakhe walala kancinci.
So please do.	Ngoko nceda wenze.
He hoped she would come back.	Wayenethemba lokuba uza kubuya.
It's just that everything has to happen fast.	Kuphela nje ukuba yonke into kufuneka yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He was not inside the house.	Wayengekho ngaphakathi endlwini.
No, not that, when.	Hayi, hayi ukuba, nini.
It would be a good thing.	Iya kuba yinto entle.
There is another car.	Kukho enye imoto.
Probably more along the way.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi ngendlela.
I don't know what my music will be like.	Andazi ukuba uzakuba njani umculo wam.
Good on you, really.	Kuhle kuwe, ngokwenene.
It takes a long time to do this.	Kuthatha ixesha elide ukwenza oku.
There was no need for him to go anywhere.	Kwakungekho mfuneko yokuba aye ndawo.
True at this time.	Inyaniso ngeli xesha.
But that means getting there first.	Kodwa oko kuthetha ukuya kuqala.
I did not want to go out at all.	Ndandingafuni tu ukuphuma.
There is a mother, of course.	Ukhona umama, kunjalo.
But it is really difficult.	Kodwa kunzima ngokwenene.
Food in it.	Ukutya kuyo.
The gun, he thought.	Umpu, wacinga.
Maybe he wasn't there now.	Mhlawumbi wayengekho ngoku.
He died badly.	Wafa kakubi.
He just said to go.	Uthe nje ukuba ahambe.
He wants you to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba ube yedwa.
But my wife did not.	Kodwa umfazi wam akazange.
I hope you know.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi.
One can never think.	Umntu akanakuze acinge.
I am leaving tomorrow evening.	Ndiya kuhamba ngomso ngokuhlwa.
He says he wants to stay with me.	Uthi ufuna ukuhlala nam.
Outside, of course.	Ngaphandle, kunjalo.
But it was not too early.	Kodwa zange kwangethuba.
That had never happened to him before.	Ayizange yenzeke loo nto kuye ngaphambili.
So he spent time talking to us.	Ngoko wachitha lonke ixesha ethetha nathi.
But that will be the end of it.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba ekugqibeleni.
You should be ready by now.	Bekufanele ukuba sele ulungile ngoku.
You may be tired.	Usenokuba udiniwe.
I can live with me very well, thank you.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhlala nam kakuhle kakhulu, enkosi.
I don't know why but I just love it.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kodwa ndiyayithanda nje.
I just wanted to meet him, talk to him.	Bendifuna nje ukudibana naye, ndithethe naye.
What is better.	Yintoni engcono.
We don't have to do it.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba siyenze.
Well, maybe a few.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ezimbalwa.
Like me, but not bad.	Njengam, kodwa hayi kakubi.
Of course, this is good.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oku kuhle.
But it is unlikely to be the case.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
And yet, not always.	Kwaye nangona kunjalo, hayi rhoqo.
I heard about him, too.	Ndeva ngaye, nam.
Good job on all of this.	Umsebenzi omhle kuyo yonke le nto.
You can do it today.	Ungayenza namhlanje.
Good, he thought, or bad.	Ulungile, wayecinga, okanye embi.
You better tell her to come.	Kungcono umxelele eze.
They say it won't hurt.	Bathi akuyi kuba buhlungu.
You will do very well here.	Uza kwenza kakuhle kakhulu apha.
I doubt it will be painful.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kuya kuba buhlungu.
There is only now.	Kukho kuphela ngoku.
My mother is a doctor.	Umama ngugqirha.
That goes well.	Oko kuhamba kakuhle.
It's hard outside.	Kunzima ngaphandle.
Yes, a good person is fine.	Ewe, umntu olungileyo kulungile.
I'm glad you're good and you look good with it.	Ndiyavuya ulungile kwaye ubonakala ulungile ngayo.
See what it's made of.	Jonga ukuba yenziwe ntoni na.
Many people today.	Abantu abaninzi namhlanje.
But this did not happen to me at the time.	Kodwa oku akuzange kwenzeke kum ngelo xesha.
There seemed to be something wrong with that.	Kwakubonakala ngathi kukho into engalunganga ngaloo nto.
You can't say what someone thinks.	Awukwazi ukuthetha ukuba umntu ucinga ntoni.
No one really knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto ngokwenene.
Remember, we had to do it right away.	Ungalibali ukuba le nto kwafuneka siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
Tell me later.	Ndixelele kamva.
Other than that, it is not very difficult.	Ngaphandle koko, akukho nzima kakhulu.
He wants to, but he can't.	Uyafuna, kodwa akakwazi.
He came out and told me everything.	Uye waphuma wandixelela yonke into.
Thank you very much and I am happy to meet you.	Enkosi kakhulu kwaye ndiyavuya ukudibana nawe.
It's hard to do anything.	Kunzima ukwenza nto.
He never really made friends.	Akazange enze abahlobo ngokwenene.
He died before that could happen.	Wafa ngaphambi kokuba oku kwenzeke.
Everyone is so happy for me.	Wonke umntu uyavuya kakhulu ngenxa yam.
And one day after that.	Kwaye ngenye imini emva koko.
But not just the house.	Kodwa hayi indlu kuphela.
I want better.	Ndifuna ngcono.
He appeared a little too late after that.	Wabonakala kancinci kakhulu emva koko.
Only three weeks.	Iiveki ezintathu kuphela.
It is possible to think of something but think of something else.	Kunokwenzeka ukucinga into kodwa ucinge ngenye into.
Waiting for time.	Ukulinda ixesha.
It was not difficult.	Akuzange kube nzima.
I need to do this quickly.	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngokukhawuleza oku.
He can't go far.	Akakwazi ukuya kude.
Everyone is busy now.	Wonke umntu ngoku uxakekile.
for it is not so.	kuba akunjalo.
Maybe you should go further.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uhambe ngakumbi.
I'm not good at all about this.	Andikho mhle kwaphela kule nto.
We know exactly where all the money is going.	Siyazi kakuhle apho yonke imali iya khona.
He did it himself.	Wenza ngokwakhe.
This should not be the case at all, however.	Oku akufuneki ngokupheleleyo ukuba kube njalo, nangona kunjalo.
The bike will do.	Ibhayisekile iya kwenza.
We will find the story.	Siza kufumana ibali.
And the question.	Kwaye umbuzo.
I just wanted to meet you.	Bendifuna nje ukudibana nawe.
Do you think of me.	Ngaba ucinga ngam.
I want him to learn more.	Ndifuna afunde ngakumbi.
No, he's not going anywhere this time.	Hayi, akayi ndawo ngeli xesha.
Please, think about it.	Nceda, ucinge ngayo.
I will never be really old.	Andisayi kuba mdala ngokwenene.
I know you want to see your mom.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukubona umama wakho.
I’ve come a long and long time ago.	Ndifike kunzima kwaye kudala.
Sorry, they say.	Uxolo, bathi.
He made a speech about it.	Wenza intetho ngayo.
I have forgotten about it until now.	Ndilibele ngayo kude kube ngoku.
I don’t know about him, though.	Andazi ngaye, nangona kunjalo.
I don’t want to do it for long.	Andifuni ukuyenza ixesha elide.
I didn’t want to talk too much or too little.	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha kakhulu okanye kancinci kakhulu.
I hope this place will last a long time.	Ndiyathemba ukuba le ndawo iza kuhlala ixesha elide.
If anyone can do that.	Ukuba nabani na uyakwazi ukwenza njalo.
She was so sweet.	Waba mnandi kakhulu.
However, if it is wrong, look outside.	Nangona kunjalo, xa engalunganga, jonga ngaphandle.
But there are more.	Kodwa kukho ezinye izinto ezininzi.
He never had her.	Akazange abe naye.
She has talked about him a little bit.	Uye wathetha ngaye kancinci.
He lives here with me.	Uhlala apha nam.
Down in it.	Phantsi kuyo.
It is certainly too good to be true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuhle kakhulu ukuba yinyani.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Akukho nto inokuba yinyani kangako.
I'm trying to find a new place to stay.	Ndizama ukufumana indawo entsha yokuhlala.
We may have made one case.	Inokuba senze ityala elinye.
But he knew nothing about it.	Kodwa wayengazi nto ngale nto.
Finally he saw.	Ekugqibeleni wabona.
I do a lot of things, but I don't.	Ndenza izinto ezininzi, kodwa akunjalo.
I will do it myself.	Nam ndiza kuyenza ngokwam.
I apologize to her.	Ndicela uxolo kuye.
None of your coffee.	Akukho ikofu yakho.
You want to make money.	Ufuna ukwenza imali.
Because they go, regularly.	Ngenxa yokuba baya, rhoqo.
It will be a long time.	Iza kuba lixesha elide.
Or not exactly.	Okanye hayi ncam.
I'm trying to find this way.	Ndizama ukufumana le ndlela.
To me, not so much.	Kum, hayi kakhulu.
And it will be true.	Kwaye kuya kuba yinyani.
Yes you are scared.	Ewe uyoyika.
For anything to me.	Kuba nantoni na kum.
He walked into the office.	Wangena eofisini.
My question works a bit.	Umbuzo wam usebenza kancinci.
You are human, too.	Ungumntu, nawe.
The same problem every time.	Ingxaki efanayo rhoqo.
He did not want anyone to know anything about him.	Wayengafuni mntu wazi nto ngaye.
Everything probably.	Yonke into mhlawumbi.
There is no danger to him.	Akukho ngozi kuye.
He gave people another chance.	Wanika abantu elinye ithuba.
Probably the best way to do this.	Mhlawumbi indlela engcono yokwenza oku.
One of us will have to go with him.	Omnye wethu kuya kufuneka ahambe naye.
We don't have to do anything big about this.	Akufunekanga senze into enkulu ngale nto.
Great job, everyone.	Umsebenzi omkhulu, wonke umntu.
She is there, waiting in her room.	Ukhona, ulinde egumbini lakhe.
Of course you did not.	Ewe awuzange wenze njalo.
He is the very first person.	Ungumntu wokuqala kakhulu.
It's better, but not much better.	Kungcono, kodwa akukho ngcono kakhulu.
Piano too.	Ipiyano nayo.
I'm just trying to make a small space.	Ndizama nje ukwenza indawo encinci.
But that won't happen, either.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka, mhlawumbi.
Only you will make your way.	Nguwe kuphela oza kuyenza indlela yakho.
I do my homework.	Ndenza umsebenzi wam wasekhaya.
I learned something recently.	Ndifunde into mva nje.
It's making money.	Kukwenza imali.
No problem though.	Akukho ngxaki kodwa.
If there are any.	Ukuba kukho ezinye.
That's the problem.	Yiloo nto ingxaki.
Everything will be better soon.	Konke kuya kuba ngcono kungekudala.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto ngayo.
I just want his job.	Ndifuna nje umsebenzi wakhe.
Probably not.	Inokuba akukho.
You will be wasting your money.	Uya kuba udlala ngemali yakho.
He was able to stop.	Wakwazi ukuyeka.
I would like to know what he looked like.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba wayekhangeleka njani.
If you like.	Ukuba ungathanda .
And the drive is very good to go.	Kwaye ukuqhuba kakuhle kakhulu ukuya.
But, soon something happened.	Kodwa, kungekudala kukho into eyenzekayo.
I don’t remember exactly, though.	Andikhumbuli kakuhle, nangona kunjalo.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa kwenzeka into entsha.
And maybe me too.	Kwaye mhlawumbi nam.
But will they succeed ?.	Kodwa baya kuphumelela?.
She heard immediately that he was not there.	Weva kwangoko ukuba akakho.
If there is a better way please tell.	Ukuba kukho indlela engcono nceda uxelele.
Once upon a time there was too much.	Kanye lixesha elininzi kakhulu.
The big problem there.	Ingxaki enkulu apho.
You will be there.	Uya kuba lapho.
He did everything else.	Wenza yonke enye into.
Man is not like that.	Umntu akanjalo.
Maybe you did.	Mhlawumbi wenze njalo.
No one came back to us.	Akukho mntu wabuyela kuthi.
Now, if you're all right.	Ngoku, ukuba ulungile .
He knew then that he would like to.	Wayesazi ngoko ukuba angathanda.
Clearly there is something completely wrong with him.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into engalunganga kuye ngokupheleleyo.
But you.	Kodwa wena .
I also .	Mna nam .
In this there was nothing at all.	Kule nto kwakungekho nto kwaphela.
He rolled his eyes.	Wakhupha amehlo akhe.
He was off work for a few days.	Wayengekho emsebenzini iintsuku ezimbalwa.
Not because he was afraid.	Hayi kuba wayesoyika.
Not that you are scared.	Hayi ukuba uyoyika.
Either way no.	Ngenye indlela akukho.
Of course, he told me that many times.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wandixelela njalo izihlandlo ezininzi.
Yesterday it seems.	Izolo kubonakala.
Good work.	Umsebenzi mhle.
She will never talk about him at all.	Soze athethe ngaye tu.
I hope you get better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uzakuba ngcono.
I can't stay here all day.	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha imini yonke.
Money will come later.	Imali iza kuza kamva.
I said something nice about you.	Ndithethe into entle ngawe.
You know, a gift.	Uyazi, isipho.
I just didn’t want to take a chance.	Ndandingafuni nje ukuthatha ithuba.
There is nothing wrong with feeling that way.	Akukho nto uziva kakubi ngayo.
Yes!' 	Ewe!'
But tell others that.	Kodwa xelela abanye oko.
Her son is expecting her to stop.	Unyana wakhe ulindele ukuba ayeke.
He did not try too fast.	Akazange azame kakhulu ngokukhawuleza.
We all need to do this.	Kufuneka senze oku sonke.
I have been thinking about it a lot lately.	Bendicinga ngayo kakhulu mva nje.
I told her to talk to you about it.	Ndimxelele ukuba athethe nawe ngayo.
He agreed, but asked for another.	Wavuma, kodwa wacela enye.
I’m sure there is nothing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho nto yonke.
How to make it happen.	Indlela yokwenza ukuba kwenzeke.
Maybe your dad made a mistake.	Mhlawumbi utata wakho wenze impazamo.
I want to do this only once.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku kube kanye kuphela.
Maybe you want to try before you buy.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuzama ngaphambi kokuba uthenge.
Otherwise it is not necessary.	Ngaphandle koko akukho mfuneko.
No, I'm not sure, but he hoped it was.	Hayi, andiqinisekanga, kodwa wayenethemba lokuba kunjalo.
Then it will be now very quickly.	Emva koko iya kuba ngoku ngokukhawuleza.
I would definitely love to play there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingathanda ukudlala phaya.
He said it would be very difficult.	Uthe kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
But she is optimistic.	Kodwa unethemba.
I wonder about.	Ndiyazibuza malunga.
That's my plan, of course.	Licebo lam elo, kunjalo.
So very, very sorry.	Ngoko kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.
It's really better.	Kungcono ngokwenene.
He read quickly, thinking badly.	Wafunda ngokukhawuleza, wacinga kakubi.
No, he wanted to go with her.	Hayi, wayefuna ahambe naye.
A quick walk to the park.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza ukuya epakini.
He thought this was so.	Wacinga ukuba oku kunjalo.
But it takes more than that.	Kodwa kuthatha ngaphezu koko.
Thinking enough, talking enough.	Ukucinga ngokwaneleyo, ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
I think my diet should be good.	Ndicinga ukuba ukutya kwam kufuneka kulungile.
But he is also determined.	Kodwa kwakhona uzimisele.
But don't say that.	Kodwa musa ukuyithetha loo nto.
And you like that too.	Kwaye nawe uyayithanda loo nto.
I thought you were interested.	Bendicinga ukuba unomdla.
I think that all the time.	Ndicinga ukuba ngalo lonke ixesha.
I just forgot why.	Ndilibele nje ukuba kutheni.
He would arrive on time.	Wayeza kufika kwangethuba.
He walked for a long time.	Wahamba ixesha elide.
I go ahead with it.	Ndiya phambili ngayo.
He became very angry.	Waba nomsindo kakhulu.
But no, obviously, too.	Kodwa hayi, ngokucacileyo, kakhulu.
It seems to be going well without me.	Kubonakala ngathi kuhamba kakuhle ngaphandle kwam.
We will go a long way.	Siza kuhamba ixesha elide.
Maybe he just wanted more time.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna nje ixesha elingakumbi.
He admitted that he knew nothing.	Wavuma ukuba akazi nto.
But he did not think of her that morning.	Kodwa wayengacingi ngaye ngaloo ntsasa.
Although that will be the first.	Nangona oko kuya kuba ngowokuqala.
So it is not possible.	Ngoko ke akunakwenzeka.
They say no we are not.	Bathi hayi asiyi.
And you will be with him.	Kwaye uya kuba naye.
So I don't want to try that anytime soon.	Ngoko ke andifuni kuzama oko nanini na kungekudala.
But everyone knew better.	Kodwa wonke umntu wayesazi ngcono.
Certainly not more than that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ngaphezu koko.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni kuyenza loo nto.
So it was not easy.	Ngoko akuzange kube lula.
They will need constant attention.	Baza kufuna ingqalelo rhoqo.
A week went by.	Kwaphela iveki.
This means a lot.	Oku kuthetha okuninzi.
Or a bicycle.	Okanye ibhayisekile.
He thought he should find someone else.	Wayecinga ukuba ufanele afune omnye umntu.
So it seemed then.	Ngoko kwakubonakala ngoko.
But it is not just about him.	Kodwa akukho ngaye kuphela.
I'll see you soon if you do or not.	Ndiza kubona kungekudala ukuba uyenzile okanye hayi.
But in a really good way.	Kodwa ngendlela entle ngokwenene.
And it wasn’t for me.	Kwaye kwakungekho kum.
One must have thought so.	Umntu umele ukuba wayecinga njalo.
Or just this.	Okanye nje oku.
Just at home.	Nje ekhaya.
He’s trying to take a lot of things out of me.	Uzama ukuthatha izinto ezininzi kum.
He wanted to be there for her.	Wayefuna ukuba lapho ngenxa yakhe.
Not up and not down.	Hayi phezulu kwaye akukho phantsi.
So we did not.	Ngoko asizange .
He also knew that there was no one inside.	Wayesazi nokuba akukho mntu ngaphakathi.
See what happens next.	Jonga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni emva koko.
Bad place to be.	Indawo embi ukuba ube kuyo.
I know exactly what is coming.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into ezayo.
You must be there.	Kumele ukuba ukhona.
Yes to it.	Ewe kuyo.
That's it, just one week.	Yiloo nto, iveki nje enye.
I don't want to talk to her.	Andifuni kuthetha naye.
Not people.	Hayi abantu.
Mother, father, children.	Umama, utata, abantwana.
I did my homework.	Ndenze umsebenzi wam wasekhaya.
Until then, no one knew anything.	Kude kube ngoko, akukho mntu wazi nto.
What is this? 	Yintoni lento?
I have to come the other way.	Kufuneka ndize ngenye indlela.
And in the end he did nothing.	Kwaye ekugqibeleni akenzanga nto.
He was retired.	Wayedla umhlala-phantsi.
And everything else, about that.	Kwaye yonke enye into, ngaloo nto.
He had to think as much as he could.	Kwafuneka acinge kangangoko.
As you are.	Njengoko unjalo.
I know they will say no.	Ndiyazi ukuba baya kuthi hayi.
I'm a better person now.	Ndingumntu ongcono ngoku.
Now it's your job.	Ngoku ngumsebenzi wakho.
I will .	Ndiza .
Probably how and why.	Mhlawumbi nokuba njani kwaye kutheni.
I certainly never did that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
He wants you to read.	Ufuna ukuba ufunda.
Obviously this is not necessary.	Ngokucacileyo oku akuyomfuneko.
However, that would be very difficult.	Nangona kunjalo, oko kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Let me say one more thing, though.	Makhe ndithethe enye into, nangona kunjalo.
You just have to buy from it.	Kufuneka nje uthenge kuyo.
But you do not have to wait long.	Kodwa akufuneki ulinde ixesha elide.
I could not eat my lunch.	Andikwazanga ukutya isidlo sam sasemini.
But that can be so.	Kodwa oko kunokuba njalo.
His performance is excellent.	Ukusebenza kwakhe kuhle kakhulu.
So maybe okay.	Ngoko mhlawumbi kulungile.
I mean money.	Ndithetha imali.
Then, it is possible that.	Emva koko, kunokwenzeka ukuba .
He doesn't know what you know.	Akayazi into yokuba uyazi.
I can do it today.	Ndingayenza namhlanje.
Just helping people.	Ukunceda abantu nje.
Many more days.	Ezinye iintsuku ezininzi.
This is my job.	Ndim lo ngumsebenzi wam.
That's a bad thing.	Nantso into embi.
This means,.	Oku kuthetha ukuba, .
If possible again.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka kwakhona.
And one more thing.	Kwaye enye into encinci.
The decision.	Isigqibo .
Well done.	Kulungile ukuba uyenzile.
But, this is the case.	Kodwa, oku kunjalo.
And she is fine.	Kwaye uhleli kakuhle.
You can see where the money is going.	Uyakwazi ukubona apho imali iya khona.
I think you know about it.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ngayo.
He picked up his phone.	Uye wathatha ifowuni yakhe.
Both long ago.	Bobabini kudala.
You know you can't get out of this.	Uyazi ukuba awukwazi ukuphuma kule nto.
This means you will have to do three things.	Oku kuthetha ukuba kuya kufuneka wenze izinto ezintathu.
Another few years or so.	Enye iminyaka embalwa okanye kunjalo.
I'll be there, whatever it is.	Ndiya kuba lapho, nokuba yintoni na.
My mother saw something wrong.	Umama wabona into engalunganga.
As soon as.	Njengoko kwangoko.
He is absolutely right, though.	Unjalo ngokupheleleyo, nangona kunjalo.
So that we can go faster.	Ukuze sihambe ngokukhawuleza.
In a better way, of course.	Ngendlela engcono, kunjalo.
Look, he said.	Jonga, uthe.
You have to be beautiful.	Ufanele ukuba mhle.
So it could just be me.	Ngoko inokuba ndim nje.
He hoped she didn't want to go with him.	Wayenethemba lokuba akafuni ukuhamba naye.
He did not appear to be a woman.	Akazange abonakale umfazi.
Although he did not want to.	Nangona wayengafuni.
Our doctor is fine.	Ugqirha wethu ulungile.
Just a few books.	Iincwadi nje ezimbalwa.
No matter how long it takes.	Nokuba kuthatha ixesha elingakanani.
Maybe suddenly, he thought.	Mhlawumbi ngokukhawuleza, wacinga.
Not next to him.	Hayi ecaleni kwakhe.
You have to look at that.	Kufuneka ujonge kuloo nto.
This makes a big mistake.	Oku kwenza impazamo enkulu.
Maybe true, yes.	Mhlawumbi yinyani, ewe.
I will try to find a new one.	Ndiza kuzama ukufumana entsha.
No, it's not fun.	Hayi, akukho mnandi.
He is interested and lives now.	Unomdla kwaye uhlala ngoku.
He does that and he knows it.	Wenza loo nto kwaye uyayazi.
Just three weeks.	Iiveki nje ezintathu.
That is true of all of us.	Yinyani leyo kuthi sonke.
Maybe he really wanted to get out.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ngokwenene ukuphuma.
He said he knew that.	Wathi uyayazi loo nto.
You feel because you are human.	Uziva kuba ungumntu.
Good luck to you.	Ndihambe kakuhle kuwe.
I don't remember doing it.	Andikhumbuli ndiyenza.
I made a mistake the other day.	Ndenza impazamo ngenye imini.
You need two days.	Ufuna iintsuku ezimbini.
Impossible, but there is a chance.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kukho ithuba.
Maybe he was just not at home.	Mhlawumbi wayengekho nje ekhaya.
I can't wait for you.	Andikwazi ukulinda wena.
You can improve this.	Ungayenza ngcono le nto.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa ayisiyiyo le nto.
But no, there is no way.	Kodwa hayi, akukho ndlela.
Well, that's what you want to do.	Kulungile, nantso into ofuna ukuyenza.
I want you to know beforehand.	Ndifuna ukuba uyazi ngaphambili.
He would wait there.	Wayeza kulinda apho.
Music at a good time.	Umculo ngexesha elihle.
But, everything happened very quickly.	Kodwa, yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
I just want to know if they live.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba bahlala.
It is too late.	Kude kakhulu emva kwexesha.
It will end soon.	Iza kuphela kungekudala.
And so is he.	Kwaye naye unjalo.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
He tried everything right.	Wazama konke kulungile.
Such a small place.	Indawo encinci enjalo.
But he probably did not think about it at all.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akazange acinge ngayo kwaphela.
He knows the way everywhere.	Uyayazi indlela kuyo yonke indawo.
Stop doing something big with it.	Yeka ukwenza into enkulu ngayo.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange avume.
You know right now.	Uyazi ngoku ngoku.
Living in the city was not necessary.	Ukuhlala edolophini kwakungeyomfuneko.
I really should have.	Ngenene ndifanele ukuba.
But it seems difficult now.	Kodwa kubonakala kunzima ngoku.
Someone took his parents.	Umntu wathatha abazali bakhe.
He pulled out the book again.	Wakhupha incwadi kwakhona.
Just a few questions, if you like.	Imibuzo embalwa nje, ukuba uyathanda.
But we have to be there.	Kodwa kufuneka sibe lapho.
Really, it is.	Ngokwenene, yinyani.
And so it is with this case.	Kwaye kunjalo kule meko.
Also, he looked bad.	Kwakhona, wayekhangeleka kakubi.
She looks good and interesting.	Ubonakala ulungile kwaye unomdla.
I am not all that beautiful.	Andikho yonke into entle kangako.
But if you are lucky, there is another way.	Kodwa ukuba unethamsanqa, kukho enye indlela.
A house for us.	Indlu kuthi.
You are the only one who really made it happen.	Nguwe kuphela owenza ukuba yenzeke ngokwenene.
I never thought about how that happened or why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oko kwenzeka njani okanye kutheni.
There is something completely wrong with that.	Kukho into engalunganga ngokupheleleyo kuloo nto.
I wanted my father.	Bendifuna utata wam.
I'm tired too.	Ndidiniwe nam.
I thought a lot about it.	Ndacinga kakhulu ngayo.
That's what happened to me, you know.	Nantso into eyenzekayo kum, uyazi.
I do not have to be alone.	Akufunekanga ndibe ndedwa.
He became my best friend.	Waba ngumhlobo wam omkhulu.
And it wasn't.	Kwaye kwakungekho.
I suspect everyone is like that.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba wonke umntu unjalo.
Or, almost everyone.	Okanye, phantse wonke umntu.
In a good way though.	Ngendlela entle nangona kunjalo.
Being here on time.	Ukuba lapha ngexesha.
You will be alone.	Uzakuba yedwa.
I finally told my dad what.	Ekugqibeleni ndamxelela oko utata.
But not about that.	Kodwa hayi ngalo nto.
That can all be true.	Yonke loo nto inokuba yinyani.
Death to travel.	Ukufa ukuhamba.
And he did not want to swim.	Kwaye akazange afune ukuqubha.
He is dead now.	Wafa ngoku.
He went in, looked.	Wangena, wajonga.
It has not been easy to simplify the task.	Akuzange kube lula ukwenza lula umsebenzi.
Everything about you .	Yonke into ngawe .
I just wanted to talk.	Bendifuna nje ukuthetha.
Well, not stuff.	Kulungile, hayi izinto.
The employee should tell me which one it is.	Umsebenzi kufuneka undixelele ukuba yeyiphi.
You know exactly what it is.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
I do not see anything.	Andiboni nto tu.
Friends will be fun.	Abahlobo baya kuba mnandi.
I mean you can't.	Ndithetha ukuba awukwazi.
It's always good.	Ilungile rhoqo.
Then we need your help.	Emva koko sifuna uncedo lwakho.
Look a little farther.	Jonga kude kancinci.
Not a question.	Hayi umbuzo.
It means traveling every day.	Kuthetha ukuhamba yonke imihla.
One can be, however.	Omnye unokuba njalo, nangona kunjalo.
I look at myself.	Ndijonge ngam.
I want to know more about you.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngawe.
He's here, with me.	Ulapha, kunye nam.
Thank you today.	Enkosi namhlanje.
I'll be right after you.	Ndiya kuba kanye emva kwakho.
Yes, that would be wonderful.	Ewe, kuya kuba mnandi oko.
Learning something new is hard.	Ukufunda into entsha kunzima.
Same thing, and a little bit more.	Into efanayo, kwaye kancinci kancinci.
And always to do so.	Kwaye rhoqo ukwenza njalo.
Just to see what happens.	Ukubona nje ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
No need to stay.	Akukho mfuneko yokuhlala.
This makes a little sense to me.	Oku kwenza ingqondo encinci kum.
Again, everything is fine.	Kwakhona, yonke into ilungile.
And not just tomorrow.	Kwaye hayi nje kusasa.
I have spoken ill of you.	Ndithethe kakubi ngawe.
Death to me.	Ukufa ukuba nam.
For breakfast or something.	Ngesidlo sakusasa okanye into.
The same is true with children.	Kunjalo ke nabantwana.
It gets better.	Kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
He sat down and began to read.	Wahlala phantsi waza waqalisa ukufunda.
All right, you too.	Kulungile, nawe.
No, this is a good thing.	Hayi, yinto entle le.
Something is happening here, though.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha, nangona kunjalo.
No one will know after that.	Akukho mntu uya kukwazi emva koko.
Yes, this is entirely possible.	Ewe, oku kunokwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
I just heard his voice.	Ndive nje ilizwi lakhe.
And they will get there.	Kwaye baya kufika apho.
I have not seen many people.	Andizange ndibone abantu abaninzi.
Tell me exactly what's going on.	Ndixelele kanye kanye ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
It is hardly impossible.	Kunzima ukuba akunakwenzeka.
This week if not today.	Kule veki ukuba akunjalo namhlanje.
I come here almost every day.	Ndiza apha phantse yonke imihla.
I think it will be a good time.	Ndicinga ukuba iya kuba lixesha elihle.
Look again at the whole place.	Jonga kwakhona indawo yonke.
Just by force.	Ngamandla nje.
I saw the work.	Ndabona umsebenzi.
If so, thank you very much.	Ukuba kunjalo, enkosi kakhulu.
My place will be better.	Indawo yam iya kuba ngcono.
We will get coffee.	Siza kufumana ikofu.
I can walk, but slowly.	Ndiyakwazi ukuhamba, kodwa kancinci.
He felt like staying there all night.	Waziva efuna ukuhlala apho ubusuku bonke.
I do not know for hours.	Andazi iiyure.
To be here is one thing.	Ukuze ndibe lapha yinto enye.
Knowing that will happen to me.	Ukwazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka kum.
In my home.	Ekhaya lam.
Nobody said it would be easy to come here.	Akukho mntu uthe kuya kuba lula ukuza apha.
I want to stay with you there again.	Ndifuna ukuhlala nawe apho kwakhona.
I know that one day we will succeed.	Ndiyazi ukuba ngenye imini siya kuphumelela.
It can be painful.	Unokuba buhlungu.
He needs to talk to you.	Kufuneka athethe nawe.
You will get one.	Uya kufumana omnye.
A little, but he did.	Kancinci, kodwa wenza.
If that takes.	Ukuba oko kuthatha.
It is best to do it immediately.	Kungcono ukwenza ngokukhawuleza.
Definitely good.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ilungile.
I'm sure it's true.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yinyani.
Today, and every day.	Namhlanje, kwaye yonke imihla.
What happens in this case, this situation.	Kwenzeka ntoni kule meko, yile meko.
He looked up and looked down quickly.	Wajonga phezulu wajonga phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
I'm sure of that though.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto kunjalo.
We will be right after him.	Siza kuba kanye emva kwakhe.
How to be a man.	Indlela yokuba yindoda.
Not his performance, he's really good.	Hayi ukwenza kwakhe, ulungile ngokwenene.
We will win soon.	Siza kuphumelela kungekudala.
Many times he decided to do so.	Izihlandlo ezininzi wagqiba ekubeni enjenjalo.
Or, of course, everything.	Okanye, kunjalo, konke.
That's exactly right then.	Kunjalo kanye ngelo xesha.
We did that today.	Senze njalo namhlanje.
Or, he did not.	Okanye, akenzanga.
However, it will take a very long time.	Nangona kunjalo, kuya kuthatha ixesha elide kakhulu.
No one wants to die like that.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukufa ngolo hlobo .
I just wanted to buy something.	Ndandifuna nje ukuthenga into.
This place will do.	Le ndawo iya kwenza.
Every time you plan something.	Ngalo lonke ixesha uceba into.
And then he decided to talk.	Kwaye emva koko wagqiba ekubeni athethe.
Right now.	Ngoku ngoku.
I am very scared to take my bike.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu ukuthatha ibhayisekile yam.
We know what's going on.	Siyazi ukuba kuqhubeka ntoni.
Not that this is new.	Hayi ukuba yinto entsha le.
Lots of story.	Ibali elininzi.
Not for me, then.	Hayi ngam, ke.
Do you think so.	Ngaba ukucinga kwakho oko.
This does not have to happen immediately.	Oku akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke kwangoko.
But perhaps it will.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuya kufuneka.
I need someone to help.	Ndicela umntu ancede.
However, he had to do it.	Nangona kunjalo, kwafuneka ayenze.
Not for a few years.	Hayi ngeminyaka embalwa.
She ran to me.	Wabaleka weza kum.
I also did not speak.	Nam khange ndithethe.
If there is no problem.	Ukuba akukho ngxaki.
Yes, that would be great.	Ewe, kuya kuba kuhle.
Singing is hard.	Ukucula kunzima.
You understand now.	Uye waqonda ngoku.
Or not well.	Okanye hayi kakuhle.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungekho.
If you want to go with us.	Ukuba uyafuna ukuhamba nathi .
I would like to play with him.	Ndingathanda ukudlala naye.
So, it looks like you have it.	Ngoko, kubonakala ngathi unayo.
And he went on, and he went on.	Kwaye waqhubeka, kwaye waqhubeka.
He wanted to be human.	Wayefuna ukuba ngumntu.
Or no matter how hard you try.	Okanye nokuba uzama ukwenza njani.
He said he knew how.	Wathi uyazi njani.
I thought of you.	Ndacinga ngawe.
Well maybe so.	Kulungile mhlawumbi kunjalo.
I don't know who he knew.	Andazi ukuba wayesazi bani.
It comes in handy.	Iza kakhulu.
There is nothing there, really.	Akukho nto apho, ngokwenene.
He’s very interested in talking a little bit.	Unomdla kakhulu ukuthetha kancinci.
Of course she never told him.	Ewe zange amxelele.
So you think about it.	Ngoko ucinga ngayo.
Look back next week.	Jonga kwiveki ezayo.
I will try that.	Ndiza kuzama ngolo hlobo.
Sorry, but the week is hard.	Uxolo, kodwa iveki nzima.
I know for sure tomorrow.	Ndiyazi ngomso ngokuqinisekileyo.
There is a way to do this again.	Kukho indlela yokwenza oku kwakhona.
Or next week.	Okanye kwiveki ezayo.
My mother ended up sleeping in her car.	Umama wagqiba walala emotweni yakhe.
And he wondered.	Kwaye wazibuza.
This one is like me.	Lo ufana nam.
I did not hear anything.	Khange ndive kwanto.
Buying a car is a big deal.	Ukuthenga imoto yinto enkulu.
But you will see, you will see.	Kodwa uya kubona, uya kubona.
I think it is very difficult.	Ndicinga ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
And all of this will happen very soon, very often.	Kwaye konke oku kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza, kakhulu.
And we want another way.	Kwaye sifuna enye indlela.
Just for sure.	Kanye ngokuqinisekileyo.
No one likes to eat alone.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukutya yedwa.
So he knew that now or never.	Ngoko wayesazi ukuba ngoku okanye akuzange kwenzeke.
I saw this this afternoon.	Ndibone oku ngale njikalanga.
He just wants his mother.	Ufuna nje umama wakhe.
There was nothing to live in.	Kwakungekho nto ukuhlala kuyo.
Fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza .
Thank you very much!!!!.	Enkosi kakhulu!!!!.
Don't go too far for it.	Musa ukuya kude kakhulu kuyo.
That makes one person.	Oko kwenza umntu omnye.
Almost no one.	Phantse akukho mntu.
Plus, it’s hard to make a small ball.	Ngaphezu koko, kunzima ukwenza ibhola encinci.
Once in this place.	Kanye kule ndawo.
He did not give up yet.	Akazange ayeke kodwa.
Controversy was able to protect.	Utata akakwazi kulinda.
He lived in his house for many years after that.	Wahlala endlwini yakhe iminyaka emininzi emva koko.
Look at it, you will find things in it.	Jonga kuyo, uya kufumana izinto kuyo.
He lived well with her.	Wahlala naye kakuhle.
That only means you are human.	Oko kuthetha kuphela ukuba ungumntu.
I mean we do.	Ndithetha ukuba senze.
I love it, myself.	Ndiyayithanda, ngokwam.
He did not know how or why this happened.	Wayengazi ukuba kwenzeke njani okanye kutheni oku kwenzeke.
But we will try harder.	Kodwa siya kuzama ngakumbi.
In that sense you are like everyone else.	Ngaloo nto ufana naye wonke umntu.
Because it will take a lot.	Kuba kuya kuthatha kakhulu.
Don't just do it.	Musa nje ukwenza.
I'll take it all the time.	Ndiza kuthatha lonke ixesha.
But he meant something else.	Kodwa wayethetha enye.
And how wonderful it would be if you could do another one.	Kwaye kunokuba mnandi njani ukuba uyenzile enye.
But it could be you alone.	Kodwa inokuba nguwe kuphela.
No one has ever spoken like this to him before.	Akukho mntu wakha wathetha ngolu hlobo naye ngaphambili.
And before that,.	Kwaye ngaphambi koko,.
And at night.	Kwaye ebusuku.
Thank you for this, thank you very much.	Enkosi ngale nto, enkosi kakhulu.
I made a small speech.	Ndenze intetho encinci.
How much did he know.	Wayesazi kangakanani.
But that will happen for now.	Kodwa oko kuya kwenzeka okwangoku.
You need to do this now.	Kufuneka wenze oku ngoku.
Yes, one or two.	Ewe, enye okanye ezimbini.
I think he probably knew.	Ndicinga ukuba usenokuba wayesazi.
You will get it again, but you do not have to have it.	Uya kufumana kwakhona, kodwa akufuneki ube nayo.
I want everything else.	Ndifuna yonke enye into.
Beautiful, by the way.	Mhle, ngendlela.
I know everything about it.	Ndiyazi yonke into ngayo.
But there was no one at home.	Kodwa kwakungekho mntu ekhaya.
He reached the top.	Ufike phezulu.
If he was going to go all that way.	Ukuba wayeza kuhamba yonke loo ndlela.
You're wasting money.	Uchitha imali.
They said they did not.	Bathi abazange.
And so is everyone.	Kwaye kunjalo wonke umntu.
Less money will go away.	Imali encinci iya kude.
Maybe he'll come back again.	Mhlawumbi uya kubuya kwakhona.
Nobody wants to stay long.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala ixesha elide.
But you are about to do it.	Kodwa sele uza kuyenza.
So it seems like a big deal.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
But he can't stop thinking.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyeka ukucinga.
Not so much, but it is possible.	Akunjalo kakhulu, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
It would be better without him, of course.	Kuya kuba ngcono ngaphandle kwakhe, kunjalo.
I did not want to come.	Bendingafuni ukuza.
Suddenly, everyone wants something.	Ngokukhawuleza, wonke umntu ufuna into ethile.
This will make his job easier.	Oku kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakhe ube lula.
You will not have to do anything.	Akuyi kufuneka wenze nantoni na .
You do not want this job in front of you.	Awufuni lo msebenzi phambi kwakho.
But he does not know everything.	Kodwa akazi yonke into.
Not if you would like to.	Akunjalo ukuba ungathanda.
I always want to make new music.	Ndihlala ndifuna ukwenza umculo omtsha.
Well, that's all one big thing.	Ewe, yonke loo nto yinto enye enkulu.
But he is even more afraid of the problem.	Kodwa woyika ngakumbi ingxaki.
Yes, every woman is like that.	Ewe, wonke umfazi kunjalo.
That's your bike.	Nantso ibhayisekile yakho.
Now everything is clear and concise.	Ngoku konke kucacile kwaye kucacile.
He will have to do so.	Kuza kufuneka enze njalo.
He also could not.	Naye akazange akwazi.
He wanted me to have it.	Wayefuna ndibe nayo.
You said you had to be away from everything.	Ubuthe kufuneka ube kude kuyo yonke into.
Finally he came to me.	Ekugqibeleni weza kum.
So that's a good thing for him.	Ngoko yinto entle leyo kuye.
All food is good.	Kulungile konke ukutya.
You may be trying to get the police here.	Inokuba uzama ukufumana amapolisa apha.
I did not know where he was going.	Ndandingazi ukuba uye phi.
Well, not much else.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu enye into.
He does not know.	Akasazi.
I did not know anyone at all.	Bendingazi mntu kwaphela.
That is how it is to be human.	Kunjalo ke ukuba ngumntu.
I can't wait to see much inside of you.	Andikwazi kulinda ukubona okuninzi ngaphakathi kwakho.
All night if possible.	Ubusuku bonke ukuba kunokwenzeka.
And he said to me, no.	Kwaye wathi kum, hayi.
There is nothing to play with there.	Akukho nto yokudlala apho.
Not me, or any other.	Hayi mna, okanye nayiphi na enye.
That is exactly what happened.	Yinto kanye eyenzekayo.
I came here asking for help.	Ndize apha ndicela uncedo.
If he did not do well.	Ukuba akenzanga kakuhle .
Yeah, that's a big deal.	Ewe, yinto enkulu leyo.
He walked into the restaurant.	Wangena kwindawo yokutyela.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I don't really remember.	Andikhumbuli nyani.
We know why you are here.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
He does something else with you.	Wenza enye into nawe.
You just have to know where you are looking.	Kufuneka nje wazi apho ujonge khona.
He looked away.	Uye wajonga kude.
You are almost very interested.	Phantse unomdla kakhulu.
I will never, never again, never again.	Soze ndiphinde, soze ndiphinde, soze ndiphinde.
Everyone should do it every day.	Wonke umntu kufuneka ayenze yonke imihla.
There is no work.	Akukho namnye umsebenzi.
Which if not.	Nto leyo ukuba akunjalo.
Probably, much more.	Mhlawumbi, kakhulu ngakumbi.
I always look back.	Ndihlala ndiphinde ndijonge kwakhona.
Slowly, like that.	Kancinci, ngolo hlobo.
More than that you think.	Ngaphezu koko ucinga.
He will talk to you then.	Uya kuthetha nawe ngoko.
However, that is not me.	Nangona kunjalo, ayindim lowo.
He wanted to succeed in everything.	Wayefuna ukuphumelela yonke into.
And so, none of us are home yet.	Kwaye ke, akukho namnye wethu ekhaya okwangoku.
It will buy again.	Iza kuthenga kwakhona.
Yes, just like you.	Ewe, njengawe.
The food is much better.	Ukutya kungcono kakhulu.
Whether it's right, or right.	Nokuba ilungile, okanye ilungile.
He decided when to leave and when to stay.	Wagqiba ukuba ahambe nini kwaye ahlale nini.
Drive to him.	Ukuqhuba ukuya kuye.
He does not know where he is.	Akazi nokuba uphi.
If you are always interested.	Ukuba uhlala unomdla.
You will see what happens.	Uya kubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
I really hope so.	Ngenene ndiyathemba ukuba kunjalo.
Who will be back soon.	Ngubani oza kubuya kungekudala.
Please, sit down.	Nceda, uhlale phantsi.
I never talked about it again, though.	Andizange ndiphinde ndithethe ngayo, nangona kunjalo.
I'm really sorry now.	Ndiyaxolisa nyani ngoku.
This will happen again and again.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona kwaye kwakhona.
I never thought I would.	Khange ndicinge ukuba ndenze njalo.
But now this.	Kodwa ngoku oku.
For this is he.	Ngokuba nguye lo.
You do not have to leave.	Akukho mfuneko yokuba uhambe.
That's the thing here.	Nantso into elapha.
Mary is capable of doing things.	UMariya uyakwazi ukwenza izinto.
And just a word.	Kwaye nje ilizwi.
I want to stay with my friends.	Ndifuna ukuhlala nabahlobo bam.
And he told the truth.	Kwaye wathetha inyaniso.
It will get better this way, really.	Kuya kuba ngcono ngale ndlela, ngokwenene.
If someone does, tell mom.	Ukuba umntu wenza njalo, xelela umama.
Don't forget to buy.	Ungalibali ukuthenga.
I wanted to go every day.	Ndandifuna ukuhamba yonke imihla.
I couldn't help but think of that.	Khange ndikwazi ukuzibamba ndicinga lonto.
But it is possible or not.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka okanye akunjalo.
I'm not sure he didn't.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba akazange enze njalo.
You will definitely want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufuna.
He was afraid of nothing.	Wayesoyika kwanto.
And what is wrong with him.	Kwaye yintoni engalunganga kuye.
You have to stay with us.	Kufuneka uhlale nathi.
Do you know anything more.	Ngaba uyazi nantoni na ngakumbi.
He is always.	Uhlala rhoqo.
Or any other answer.	Okanye nayiphi na impendulo.
Maybe we'll try that one day.	Mhlawumbi siya kuzama oko ngenye imini.
It is not hard enough to hurt.	Akukho nzima ngokwaneleyo ukuba buhlungu.
No one went to his house.	Kwakungekho mntu waya endlwini yakhe.
This makes it very difficult.	Oku kwenza ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
I too was looking for a place.	Nam bendifuna indawo.
Look at him.	Jonga ntoni kuye.
If you want to make one.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza enye.
But he got out.	Kodwa waphuma.
Yes, some are.	Ewe, abanye yintoni.
He stayed in that place.	Wahlala kuloo ndawo.
Coffee can be a really good thing.	Ikofu ingaba yinto entle ngokwenene.
Probably everyone knows about it.	Mhlawumbi wonke umntu uyazi malunga.
It seems to be everywhere.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho yonke indawo.
Now you want to do this.	Ngoku ufuna ukwenza oku.
When he wants to be.	Xa efuna ukuba.
But you don't have to do that here.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze oko apha.
And it is not the only thing that is wrong.	Kwaye ayisiyiyo kuphela into engalunganga.
Can someone ask for help.	Ngaba umntu ndicela uncedo.
I thought so.	Ndiye ndacinga lonto mna.
Everyone wanted to play with him.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukudlala naye.
I went to see a certain car.	Ndaya kubona imoto ethile.
If you want to work.	Ukuba ufuna ukusebenza.
And we will.	Kwaye siza kwenza.
I'll let you know if you don't.	Ndiya kukwazi ukuba awufuni.
I should not have said anything.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ndithethe nto.
You never had him.	Awuzange ube naye.
And so, he tried again.	Kwaye ke, wazama kwakhona.
It happened once.	Kwenzeka kanye.
Yes, only three years.	Ewe, iminyaka emithathu kuphela.
I didn't want to talk but.	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha kodwa.
This is not for him.	Oku akukho kuye.
It would be great to do that.	Kuya kuba kuhle kakhulu ukwenza oko.
But that takes time and will go a long way.	Kodwa oko kuthatha ixesha kwaye kuya kuphela kude.
He became a child.	Waba ngumntwana.
As little as possible.	Kancinci kangangoko.
I want you to know.	Ndifuna uyazi .
We will speak the truth now.	Siza kuthetha nyani ngoku.
Your wait will end soon.	Ukulinda kwakho kuza kuphela kungekudala.
I can't talk more about this job.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngakumbi ngalo msebenzi.
There was no one there at the time.	Kwakungekho mntu ngelo xesha.
But, you have something.	Kodwa, unayo into.
But he is here now.	Kodwa ulapha ngoku.
If he does not want us to do so.	Ukuba akafuni senze njalo.
Thank you for doing it right away.	Enkosi ngokuba uyenzile kwangoko.
He knows he doesn't know everything.	Uyazi ukuba akazi konke.
Then he saw his time.	Emva koko wabona ixesha lakhe.
I just heard in the morning.	Ndive nje ekuseni.
I really wanted to talk to her.	Ndandifuna kakubi kakhulu ukuthetha naye.
I sat next to him.	Ndihlale ecaleni kwakhe.
He said he would do it.	Wathi uza kwenza njalo.
He would go with it.	Wayeza kuhamba nayo.
Finally there.	Ekugqibeleni apho.
He goes his own way.	Uhamba ngendlela yakhe.
I have to look at my age.	Kufuneka ndijonge iminyaka yam.
Do not go out alone.	Musa ukuphuma wedwa.
You have to make money to do that.	Kufuneka ukwenza imali ukwenza oko.
I hope that one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ngenye imini.
His music never got better!	Umculo wakhe awuzange ube ngcono!
You do not have to have any problems.	Akufunekanga ube nayo nayiphi na ingxaki.
I just want you to go with me.	Ndifuna nje ukuba uhambe nam.
You've told the truth.	Uthethe inyani.
That makes three.	Oko kwenza ezintathu.
I can't go out very late at night.	Andikwazi ukuphuma ebusuku kakhulu.
Staying at home is not possible.	Ukuhlala ekhaya akunakwenzeka.
He stepped back.	Wabuyela ngasemva.
He wanted to do more.	Wayefuna ukwenza okuninzi.
Well, a little bit, at first.	Ewe, kancinci, ekuqaleni.
Good there.	Kuhle apho.
Nothing about me.	Akukho nto ngam.
I know it will take time to get there.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuthatha ixesha ukufika apho.
My father wanted me to become a doctor.	Utata wayefuna ndibe ngugqirha.
A little bit more recently.	Kancinci kancinci mva nje.
Probably my fault.	Mhlawumbi ityala lam.
And now, he certainly does that.	Kwaye ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo uyayenza loo nto.
He couldn't do it, but he tried anyway.	Akazange akwazi ukuyenza, kodwa wazama kunjalo.
He said you should arrive immediately.	Uthe kufuneka ufike kwangoko.
There are many similar questions in this area.	Kukho imibuzo emininzi efanayo kule ndawo.
Not just one, but all.	Hayi nje enye, kodwa bonke.
Yes, in it.	Ewe, kuyo.
I always think of him there.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngaye apho.
My father did all this on his own.	Utata wayenza yedwa yonke lento.
Any meat.	Nokuba yeyiphi na inyama.
A small dog, but a dog nonetheless.	Inja encinci, kodwa inja nangona kunjalo.
He looked up and left.	Wajonga phezulu, wemka.
I never thought about it again.	Khange ndiphinde ndicinge ngayo.
I beg your pardon.	ndicela uxolo.
He went his own way.	Wahamba ngendlela yakhe.
And you have quickly succeeded in it.	Kwaye uphumelele ngokukhawuleza kuyo.
My turn, now.	Ithuba lam, ngoku.
Everyone slept very well.	Wonke umntu walala kakuhle kakhulu.
But even though I learned a lot from it.	Kodwa nokuba ndifunde okuninzi kuyo.
I don't know what you will find there.	Andazi ukuba uya kufumana ntoni apho.
At work it is.	Ngomsebenzi kunjalo.
The sooner the better.	Ngokukhawuleza kungcono.
And he said yes.	Kwaye uthe ewe.
It will all mean something.	Konke kuya kuthetha into.
There seems to be no work.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho msebenzi.
Not a party but a person.	Hayi itheko kodwa ngumntu.
I love how unusual it is to finish.	Ndiyayithanda indlela engaqhelekanga ngayo ukugqiba.
Things all the way.	Izinto yonke indlela.
There is a problem with this, however.	Kukho ingxaki ngale nto, nangona kunjalo.
I did not want anything bad to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke into embi.
So do not try.	Ngoko musa ukuzama.
He had to do so.	Kwafuneka enze njalo.
True, probably.	Inyaniso, mhlawumbi.
Well, a lot of people.	Ke, abantu abaninzi.
Another car, too.	Enye imoto, nayo.
I'll talk about it later.	Ndiza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
It seems like a very big job.	Kubonakala ngathi umsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu.
I'm glad to see this.	Ndiyavuya ukubona oku.
It is your job to live here.	Ngumsebenzi wakho ukuhlala apha.
And so it always is.	Kwaye kunjalo rhoqo.
He would stay a long time in the area.	Wayeza kuhlala ixesha elide kwindawo.
At first, her mother did not want her to leave.	Ekuqaleni, umama wakhe wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.
So he needs help.	Ngoko ufuna uncedo.
He does not want to talk about this today.	Akafuni kuthetha ngale nto namhlanje.
And he became a man.	Kwaye waba yindoda.
Not tomorrow, maybe.	Hayi ngomso, mhlawumbi.
I'm not going to do it tonight.	Andiyi kuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
We know a lot.	Siyazi kakhulu.
Don't be too tall.	Musa ukuba mde.
It will certainly be difficult though.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba nzima nangona kunjalo.
Little did I know that it would continue for so long.	Ndandingazi ukuba iya kuqhubeka ixesha elide kangaka.
He did such a great thing.	Wenza into enjalo kakhulu.
About whether you are good.	Malunga nokuba ulungile.
Because it's just human.	Kuba ngumntu nje.
He did it himself.	Wakwenza oko ngokwakhe.
When you know, you know.	Xa uyazi, uyazi.
I will try one at a time and see however.	Ndiza kuzama enye ngexesha kwaye ndibone nangona kunjalo.
One day it will be so.	Ngenye imini kuya kuba njalo.
Then tell me this.	Uze undixelele oku.
No, not something else.	Hayi, hayi enye into.
I'm trying to stop.	Ndizama ukuyeka.
The doctor, after all, should know better.	Ugqirha, emva koko, kufuneka azi ngcono.
I heard about everything.	Ndive ngayo yonke into.
He told me some.	Wandixelela ezinye.
One day, that will happen.	Ngenye imini, oko kuya kwenzeka.
I want to try again.	Ndifuna ukuzama kwakhona.
Not yet.	Hayi, ngoku.
I really wanted to get this one.	Ndandifuna ngokwenene ukufumana le.
And it has never been so difficult.	Kwaye akuzange kube nzima kangako.
I'm sure it would be hard for him.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba inokuba nzima kuye.
You know it and are happy with it.	Uyayazi kwaye uyavuya kuyo.
That seemed to go well.	Oko kwakubonakala kuhamba kakuhle.
You are more than any of us.	Wena ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na kuthi.
Or maybe coffee.	Okanye mhlawumbi ikofu.
We'll get to that sooner or later.	Siza kufika kuloo nto ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva.
Yes, a new person once.	Ewe, umntu omtsha kube kanye.
And then you feel more.	Kwaye ke uziva ngakumbi.
All about you !.	Konke ngawe!.
And besides, you're already here.	Kwaye ngaphandle koko, sele ulapha.
So no.	Ngoko akukho.
I don't know what it is now.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ngoku.
He was able to do it well.	Wakwazi ukuyenza kakuhle.
And buy a new hat.	Kwaye uthenge umnqwazi omtsha.
Someone better than me.	Umntu ongcono kunam.
Not just on top.	Akunjalo nje phezulu.
It would be nice to do so, though.	Kuya kuba kuhle ukuba senze njalo, nangona kunjalo.
I would like to speak.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha.
You will be inside for many years.	Uya kuba ngaphakathi iminyaka emininzi.
But she did not think much of him.	Kodwa ke akazange acinge nto ingako ngaye.
And why to him alone? 	Kwaye kutheni kuye yedwa?
He works fast and fast.	Usebenza ngokukhawuleza kwaye ngokukhawuleza.
But these.	Kodwa ezi.
You feel like you did it.	Uziva ukuba uyenzile.
All right, let me do it once.	Kulungile, mandiyenze kube kanye.
Maybe this seems obvious.	Mhlawumbi oku kubonakala kucacile.
So that's right.	Ngoko kunjalo.
My dad wants me to do a story.	Utata ufuna ndenze ibali.
We will get there though.	Siza kufika apho kodwa.
If that is what you would like.	Ukuba yiloo nto ungathanda.
Then life happened.	Emva koko kwenzeka ubomi.
You really have to go and look.	Kufuneka uhambe ngenene ujonge.
He dropped the hat.	Wehla umnqwazi.
So to this.	Ngoko kule.
We didn’t do a very good job at it.	Asizange senze umsebenzi omhle kakhulu kuyo.
Not just above, but everywhere.	Hayi nje phezulu, kodwa yonke indawo.
He never thought about it.	Zange acinge ngayo.
That's a very good thing for him.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo kuye.
Now you do it all the time.	Ngoku uyenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
But it is better here than nowhere.	Kodwa kungcono apha kunokuba akukho ndawo.
Nice place for him.	Indawo entle kuye.
And that means.	Kwaye oko kuthetha.
Anyone knows how to make that mistake.	Nabani na uyayazi indlela yokwenza impazamo enjalo.
Everything and nothing.	Yonke into kwaye akukho nto.
Nothing to do, really.	Akukho nto yokwenza, ngokwenene.
He knew he didn't like that.	Wayesazi ukuba akayithandi loo nto.
Not my book.	Hayi incwadi yam.
He started coming to me.	Waqalisa ukuya kum.
He does it all the time.	Uyenza ngalo lonke ixesha.
No one would see it.	Akukho mntu wayeza kubona.
But he did more than that.	Kodwa wenza izinto ezininzi.
He said that it should not be so.	Wathi akufanele kube njalo.
Nobody came to talk to us.	Akukho mntu uze kuthetha nathi.
But there seems to be another place.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kukho enye indawo.
I know this because he also came to me.	Ndiyayazi loo nto kuba naye weza kum.
I did three.	Ndenze ezintathu.
But this should not happen.	Kodwa oku akufanele kwenzeke.
Very quickly, perhaps.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
I always think so.	Ndihlala ndicinga njalo.
But my son can be.	Kodwa unyana wam unokuba.
I have to pretend everything is fine.	Kufuneka ndenze ngathi yonke into ilungile.
He doesn't want me to talk.	Akafuni ndithethe.
That's it, really.	Yiloo nto, ngokwenene.
I think it should have happened this way.	Ndicinga ukuba bekufanele kwenzeke ngolu hlobo.
You look better.	Ujonge ngcono.
Why there? 	Kutheni apho?
So he refused.	Ngoko akazange avume.
I always think of you and feel the same way.	Ndihlala ndicinga ngawe kwaye ndiziva ngendlela efanayo.
Anything else is fine thank you.	Nantoni enye ilungile enkosi.
This is the whole situation.	Le meko yonke.
He loves it, he fell asleep.	Uyayithanda, walala.
He actually opened the window.	Nyani wavula ifestile.
First mother.	Umama wokuqala.
Just really soon.	Nje ngenene kungekudala.
I don't care so much about him.	Andikhathali kangako ngaye.
That is better for both of us.	Oko kungcono kuthi sobabini.
That was the biggest thing at the time.	Leyo yinto enkulu kakhulu ngelo xesha.
True, true, true.	Yinyani, yinyani, yinyani.
Then everything will be more difficult.	Emva koko konke kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He lives here, too.	Uhlala apha, naye.
I don't like it, but it's okay.	Andiyithandi, kodwa kulungile.
That's all right.	Nto leyo sele ilungile.
But very little.	Kodwa kancinci kakhulu.
Our image is what he really wants.	Umfanekiso wethu yintoni ayifunayo ngokwenene.
Everyone feels that way at first.	Wonke umntu uziva ngaloo ndlela ekuqaleni.
I thought about him a lot at night.	Ndandicinga ngaye kakhulu ebusuku.
Or either way.	Okanye nayiphi na indlela.
Slowly, very slowly.	Kancinci, kancinci kakhulu.
The father alone.	Utata yedwa.
Because it really is.	Ngenxa yokuba kunjalo ngokwenene.
Maybe your mother has it.	Mhlawumbi umama wakho unayo.
He has entered his room.	Uye wangena egumbini lakhe.
Knowing outside is possible.	Ukwazi ngaphandle kunokwenzeka.
But his journey is not easy.	Kodwa ukuhamba kwakhe akukho lula.
He wants to be with her.	Ufuna ukuba naye.
You have to do that.	Ufanele ukuyenza loo nto.
We want to work with you.	Sifuna ukusebenza nawe.
Older than you.	Mdala kunawe.
Unless you do not want to.	Ngaphandle kokuba awufuni.
I want to do the same thing.	Ndifuna ukwenza into efanayo.
He said he thought of me, very much.	Wathi uye wacinga ngam, kakhulu.
All the time, every day, everywhere.	Ngalo lonke ixesha, yonke imihla, yonke indawo.
He said something.	Uye wathetha into.
Before noon.	Ngaphambi kwemini.
I just don't know what it is.	Andikwazi nje ukuba yintoni na.
But that is just hope.	Kodwa lithemba nje elo.
If you can't afford a car, you can't stay there.	Ukuba awukwazi ukuthenga imoto, awukwazi ukuhlala apho.
That sounded good.	Kwakubonakala kulungile oko.
Is this.	Ngaba le .
He should not have left.	Bekungafanelanga ukuba ahambe.
Right up there.	Kanye phaya phezulu.
I just want to talk to everyone.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha naye wonke umntu.
I'm out here.	Ndilapha phandle.
All right, we'll go together.	Kulungile, siza kuhamba kunye.
Our job is about that.	Umsebenzi wethu malunga naloo nto.
Moreover, she is happy.	Ngaphezu koko, uyavuya.
And he felt tired.	Kwaye waziva udiniwe.
We'll get a good job there.	Siza kufumana umsebenzi olungileyo phaya.
It seems like something new every day.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into entsha yonke imihla.
They will certainly be very angry.	Ngokuqinisekileyo baya kuba nomsindo kakhulu.
And it wasn't very good.	Kwaye kwakungekho kuhle kakhulu.
But she did not dwell on such thoughts.	Kodwa akazange acinge ngayo.
And something like that.	Kwaye into enjalo.
Well, one thing at a time.	Ke, into enye ngexesha.
You may like one or two.	Ungathanda enye okanye ezimbini.
Another great time.	Enye ixesha elininzi.
You want it all at once.	Ufuna kanye kanye.
I have to be where there are people.	Kufuneka ndibe apho kukho abantu.
I did all my work that way.	Ndenze wonke umsebenzi wam ngaloo ndlela.
But if not, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
But you will see.	Kodwa uza kubona.
You didn't.	Awuzange ube.
And that will make everything easier.	Ke oko kuya kwenza lula yonke into.
Every speech.	Yonke intetho.
Great person too.	Umntu omkhulu naye.
Thinking of nothing.	Ukucinga kwanto.
No, it's too late.	Hayi, emva kwexesha kakhulu.
I deserve it.	Ndifanele.
We went to breakfast.	Siye kwisidlo sakusasa.
I don’t really know, though.	Andazi ngenene, nangona kunjalo.
And please.	Kwaye nceda .
But this is more after that.	Kodwa oku ngakumbi emva koko.
He longs for his time alone in his house.	Unqwenela ixesha lakhe yedwa endlwini yakhe.
Really, look at me.	Nyani, ndijonge.
Not all life.	Hayi bonke ubomi.
Finding a purchase.	Ukufumana ukuthenga.
But so are you.	Kodwa, nawe unjalo.
Really and truly.	Ngokwenene kwaye ngokwenene.
It's such a bad thing.	Yinto embi ngolo hlobo.
He saw the need to talk about money.	Wabona ukuba kufuneka uthethe ngemali.
Unless you do exactly that.	Ngaphandle kokuba wenza kanye loo nto.
Maybe he doesn't show up.	Mhlawumbi akabonakali.
And you do not have to tell him.	Kwaye akunyanzelekanga ukuba umxelele.
So, very much so, I am tired.	Ngoko, kakhulu, ndidiniwe.
I just want a job.	Ndifuna nje umsebenzi.
In the same room with you.	Kwigumbi elinye nawe.
But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kwenzeka into engaqhelekanga.
He needs to tell her now.	Kufuneka amxelele ngoku.
Great mom.	Umama omkhulu.
It is difficult then.	Kunzima ke ngoko.
Thinking of me.	Ukucinga ngam.
He did a few things.	Wenza izinto ezimbalwa.
Again nothing.	Kwakhona akukho nto.
It's one thing to study the house outside.	Yinto enye ukufunda indlu ngaphandle.
But he stays with me just because.	Kodwa uhleli nam nje ngokuba.
He wanted to help, but he could not.	Wayefuna ukunceda, kodwa akazange akwazi.
You know, if it's possible.	Uyazi, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I don't want to eat now.	Andifuni kutya ngoku.
Not too far away.	Akukho kude kakhulu.
He looked at you.	Wajonga kuwe.
Not for me.	Hayi kum .
It takes time to do.	Kuthatha ixesha ukwenza.
It's all true.	Yonke yinyani.
Maybe having it.	Mhlawumbi ukuba nayo.
Life is everything.	Ubomi yinto yonke.
One day, he appeared here.	Ngenye imini, wabonakala apha.
Or go home.	Okanye uhambe uye ekhaya.
It will be like this.	Kuya kuba ngeli hlobo.
However, this is clear.	Nangona kunjalo, oku kucacile.
He just works there.	Usebenza nje apho.
He talks all the time.	Uthetha lonke ixesha.
I don't have it, of course.	Andinayo, kunjalo.
Really, really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
You will make a good doctor.	Uya kwenza ugqirha olungileyo.
This question he knew was coming.	Lo mbuzo wayesazi ukuba uya kuza.
But one thing at a time.	Kodwa into enye ngexesha.
She is well dressed, but not too much.	Unxibe kakuhle, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
It might be true, you know.	Inokuba yinyani, uyazi.
Plus, by the way, you can’t talk fast enough.	Ngaphezu koko, ngendlela, awukwazi ukuthetha ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
He lay there with his problem.	Walala apho ke ingxaki yakhe.
But this is not the case at all.	Kodwa oku akunjalo konke konke.
And there is something else about him.	Kwaye kukho enye into ngaye.
I do not know exactly when.	Andazi ncam ukuba nini.
If you like.	Ukuba ungathanda.
He did not want to.	Khange afune.
Let me do this and do it.	Makhe ndenze oku kwaye ndenze.
He is just like you.	Lowo ufana nawe.
If he died immediately.	Ukuba wafa ngoko nangoko.
Not so much another thing in it really.	Hayi kakhulu enye into kuyo ngokwenene.
I did it because I wanted to know.	Ndiyenze kuba ndifuna ukwazi.
I wanted to be with you.	Bendifuna ukuba nawe.
I just wanted peace.	Ndandifuna nje uxolo.
More talk.	Ukuthetha ngakumbi.
But now, obviously, he is there.	Kodwa ngoku, ngokucacileyo, ukhona.
That's right, certainly enough.	Kunjalo, ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
No, but.	Hayi, kodwa .
Another died instantly.	Omnye wafa ngoko nangoko.
He wants to be beautiful to you.	Ufuna ukuba mhle kuwe.
He did not want to play in front of her.	Wayengafuni ukudlala phambi kwakhe.
If you want to go.	Ukuba ufuna ukuhamba.
Watch the ball carefully.	Jonga ibhola kakuhle.
Look at his wife.	Jonga umfazi wakhe.
You know how this happened.	Uyayazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
He wondered what he might be thinking.	Wayecinga ukuba inokuba ucinga ntoni.
Before he could enter, he thought better.	Ngaphambi kokuba angene, wacinga ngcono.
Far from me alone.	Kude mna ndedwa.
But how can I do this.	Kodwa ndingayenza njani lento.
He did not know what anyone wanted.	Wayengazi ukuba umntu ufuna ntoni.
Or moving faster at any time.	Okanye ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza nanini na.
It's hard to get to this place.	Kunzima ukufika kule ndawo.
Yes, it is my voice.	Ewe, ilizwi lam.
I think so too.	Nam ndiyacinga.
And for me, all the time.	Kwaye ngam, lonke ixesha.
And he never thought so.	Kwaye akazange acinge njalo.
I look away, too.	Ndijonge kude, kwakhona.
He tried alcohol.	Wazama utywala.
We have done this before.	Senze oku ngaphambili.
More beautiful house, more beautiful house.	Indlu entle ngakumbi, indlu entle ngakumbi.
Obviously this has to be there.	Ngokucacileyo oku kufuneka kube khona.
Someone probably knew where the money was.	Umntu usenokuba wayesazi ukuba iphi loo mali.
All of this is clearly happening to you.	Konke oku kwenzeka ngokucacileyo kuwe.
Don't be too hard at first.	Musa ukuba nzima kakhulu ekuqaleni.
It happened right away.	Kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
I will have it.	Ndiza kuba nayo.
And you can't think of anything bad.	Kwaye awukwazi ukucinga into embi.
Everything that happened at that time.	Yonke into eyenzekayo ngelo xesha.
Reading a book.	Ukufunda incwadi.
You know about what you have.	Uyazi malunga nawe unayo.
He should not be alone here with her.	Akufunekanga abe yedwa apha naye.
Don't say this.	Musa ukuyithetha le nto.
I don't care about anything.	Andikhathali ngayo nantoni na.
Then he said he didn't.	Emva koko uthe ayizange.
I'm glad you're out here.	Ndiyavuya ulapha phandle.
He knew he was a good man.	Wayesazi ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
I'm glad you're here to stay with him.	Ndiyavuya ulapha ukuze uhlale naye.
Your vision is good now.	Ukubona kwakho kulungile ngoku.
Now we need your help to make it happen.	Ngoku sifuna uncedo lwakho ukuze kwenzeke.
Very early departure.	Ukuhamba kwangoko kakhulu.
I checked my phone and there was nothing.	Ndijonge ifowuni yam kwaye akukho nto.
Car or wife.	Imoto okanye umfazi.
Yeah, everyone, for a long time.	Ewe, wonke umntu, ixesha elide.
